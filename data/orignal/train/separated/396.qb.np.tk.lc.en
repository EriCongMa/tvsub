criminal minds s05e03
drew. drew just--
just stop .
i get it .
that &apos;s why allison is with you .
oh god .
i am dealing with it .
ben !
well you took her from me remember ?
ben i thought you paid the bill .
what are you doing ?
ben ?
any closer and the image will distort .
how is jack ?
he &apos;s real smart .
had us in tears . great kid .
haley ?
to be honest we &apos;re moving them to a halfway house .
i thought you had found a permanent location .
haley made a number of phone calls to her mother .
it &apos;s all good but to be safe
we have to move them .
sam thank you .
i promise you
no harm will come to them .
you just concentrate on getting foyet .
happy birthday buddy .
you got a second ?
sure what is it ?
a case just came in .
i &apos;ll be right there .
actually i need to talk to you .
it &apos;s on commack long island .
that &apos;s your home town .
yeah. and if it &apos;s ok
i &apos;d rather stay behind .
why ?
it was a different life
one i left 30 years ago .
i &apos;m in no hurry to go back .
any other day i &apos;d say stay
but i just became aware of this .
what have we got ?
ben vanderwaal was killed in commack long island
last night shot at close range
once in the heart once in the head
.22 caliber shell .
they found hair and blood traces
from ben vanderwaal &apos;s wife heather .
but not heather ?
no she &apos;s still missing presumed dead .
the caliber and placement of the bullets
match that of two previous victims .
the first rita haslat .
8 months ago she went missing from her home in new jersey .
4 weeks later she was found in a trash bin .
she went from that to this in under 3 weeks ?
she &apos;s totally emaciated .
ligature marks on her wrists and ankles
indicate she was constrained .
one in the heart one in the head-- same as vanderwaal .
sounds more like an execution .
then why cut off vanderwaal &apos;s hands postmortem ?
what about the third victim ?
bill levington .
his appearance was certainly altered .
his genitals were missing .
though the method of mutilation is different in each crime
clearly there &apos;s a signature. the question is what ?
wheels @-@ up in 20 minutes .
what &apos;s this ?
you told me you were cleared to travel. you lied .
naughty boy .
uh no i didn &apos;t .
i am a doctor so technically it wasn &apos;t a lie .
what was it then ?
um ... second opinion .
hmm. you &apos;re my bitch now .
&quot; justice without force is powerless .
force without justice is tyrannical . &quot;
blaise pascal .
in the ben vanderwaal case
his hands were taken .
uh bill levington his genitals .
only in the rita haslat case she was starved and tortured
then executed
and there &apos;s no sign of postmortem mutilation .
why would he take heather vanderwaal
and not simply kill her ?
maybe he hasn &apos;t and she &apos;s still alive .
the only thing concrete is the m.o.
which depicts an efficient no @-@ nonsense murderer .
well then we need to figure out
what each act of mutilation means to the unsub .
or to the victim .
it &apos;s pretty much how we found it .
there &apos;s no signs of forced entry .
it says in the file that heather vanderwaal has a daughter .
where is she ?
she moved to san diego to
live with her real father .
ben and heather vanderwaal
have only been married a couple of years .
so heather came in she dropped her shopping bags
her cell phone and her keys but not her coat .
she turns on the lights .
but they didn &apos;t work
because the phone and the ectricity were cut .
something in this room attracted her attention .
what is it ?
marks in the blood
look like a camera tripod .
serial killers especially sexual sadists
often document their kill .
but sexual sadists usually torture their victims
while they &apos;re still alive .
you still didn &apos;t find any conflicting dna ?
no. no prints no fibers
nothing .
nobody heard any shots ?
no. oh excuse me .
yeah ?
all right .
heather vanderwaal was just found
wandering the streets half hour ago .
she &apos;s at brookside general .
get jj over there .
a killer this sophisticated doesn &apos;t leave a living witness
without a reason .
heather my name is agent jareau .
i have some questions for you .
so you came home
you tried to turn the lights on
but they didn &apos;t work .
what did you do next ?
i saw a light .
a flash .
i opened the door
and ben was there
tied to a chair .
i think he was dead .
there was another flash .
it blinded me for a moment .
did you see your attacker ?
no .
did he say anything ?
no .
i heard this noise .
what kind of noise ?
sawing .
i watched him cut off ben &apos;s hand .
why didn &apos;t he kill me ?
excuse me .
garcia .
we &apos;ve been getting to know heather vanderwaal .
i can &apos;t tell you her favorite beatle
but i can tell you she was living la vida unhappy .
what did you find ?
her ex @-@ husband took her daughter allison
out of school mid @-@ term .
after that heather cut a check for $ 5.000
to a place called
lewis bell &amp; peters
6 days ago .
law firm ?
family law .
thanks .
mrs. vanderwaal ...
at mid @-@ term you moved
your daughter out of school ?
yes i did .
after that you filed for divorce from ben .
this man left you alive for a reason .
i need to know if these two things are connected .
a few months ago
i found a picture
of allison on ben &apos;s phone .
your daughter .
she was naked .
where was it taken ?
i couldn &apos;t tell .
did you confront him ?
yes. he claimed that
allison sent it to him by mistake .
she meant to send it to another student at her school .
it &apos;s called sexting .
what did allison say ?
she said ben took it
but she--she lies .
allison she &apos;s a liar .
she caused us a lot of trouble you know ?
she wasn &apos;t lying about this though was she ?
no .
the hand removal is less than surgical .
he used a basic double @-@ toothed saw .
so the guy we &apos;re looking for
has no medical training .
not the kind i &apos;ve had .
one in the heart one in the brain
close range .
the second one was right up behind the ear .
how about gunshot residue ?
surprisingly little .
maybe it &apos;s because the killer was using a .22 .
small caliber small discharge .
what is it ?
ballistics can &apos;t match the bullets to a gun .
there were no rifling marks on the bullet .
there &apos;s only one explanation for that .
well if anyone had a motive to kill ben vanderwaal
it was heather &apos;s ex @-@ husband .
but he was in san diego and he has no connection
to the other two victims .
david rossi we finally get to meet .
detective gil hardesty . very very nice to have you with us .
morgan what did you find ?
in all cases the .22 caliber bullets had no rifling marks .
and without the barrel being rifled
the bullets would have very little velocity .
he would have to shoot his victom pointblank .
jj . this guy &apos;s using a zip gun .
now if you know what you &apos;re doing a piece of plumbing
or a kid &apos;s bicycle pump can be turned into a gun .
one in the heart one in the head .
untraceable expandable bullets tell me without question
all of these kills were strictly business .
a hitman ?
what about the postmortem mutilation ?
a contract sometimes includes extras .
the camera is not for sexual gratification it &apos;s for proof of death .
so we could be looking for two people ?
maybe . maybe more .
excuse me .
i may be able to hit on some old contacts
but i &apos;ll need to do it alone .
contacts ?
do we want to know ?
best not .
we don &apos;t open till 5 : 30 .
i &apos;m looking for the owner of that coat .
is that right ?
not with that you &apos;re not .
check out the front and back .
you &apos;re either a dead man or a cop . which one is it ?
right now i &apos;m just an old friend .
you gave up that right the day you became a fed .
ray ?
david .
i thought you retired .
writing books ?
what can i tell you ray ?
some habits are hard to break .
i try this damn puzzle every morning .
never gets any easier .
&quot; crater creator ? &quot;
you know i work with a kid
who can solve this whole thing in 5 minutes .
he must be smarter than both of us .
that &apos;s for sure .
so what &apos;s it been 30 years ?
33 .
you know i thought at the very least
i would see you at emma &apos;s funeral .
i um ... need to ask you a favor .
she loved you as much as you loved her .
hey ambition &apos;s a bitch ain &apos;t it ?
i &apos;m not here to talk about emma .
what are you here to talk about ?
you &apos;ve read the news ?
you think i got something to do with that ?
you should stick to writing books .
this guy is real specific .
he uses a zip gun and then throws in extras .
for a smart guy your coming back here was a real dumb move .
not as dumb as the one that sean made .
he &apos;s on trial for the transportation of weapons
no doubt for you .
and what about the rico beef hanging over your head ?
you help me
and you &apos;ll be assisting a federal investigation .
and what exactly is that gonna do for my reputation ?
if you don &apos;t
you may not have one to protect .
our organized crime unit is very close
to shutting you down permanently .
keep talking .
the removal of the hands is as specific
as rita haslat &apos;s condition was when she was found .
just as specific as the removal of bill levington &apos;s genitals .
there &apos;s a message in the mutilations
the unsub wants us to know .
i got something here that might help us with--
technically we have something here that might help with that .
bill levington was involved in a serial rape case
all involving minors and it never went to trial .
rita haslat ?
a former social worker
a former--
attained said former status
when she was fired from the dcfs for gross negligence .
in one of her cases a 7 @-@ year @-@ old boy starved to death .
which explains why haslat was so emaciated when she was found .
if all the victims were indicated in crimes against children
then we &apos;ve found a connection .
one of the unsubs has access to the crimes of the victims
and probably works in the justice system . garcia ?
on it .
on it .
all right well we know what the victims have in common
we just need to find out who they have in common .
wait. this social worker and the suspected rape case
those were matters of record .
ben vanderwaal &apos;s relationship with his stepdaughter is not .
unless the stepdaughter told someone else .
i &apos;ll call rossi .
i &apos;ll have the daughter brought in .
and all 3 crimes were against children ?
ok. thanks prentiss .
cuban no doubt .
contraband ?
some laws are just plain unjust .
you know those 3 individuals messed with kids .
they got what they deserve .
that all depends on your definition of justice .
it &apos;s the same as when we were kids .
you do what you gotta do to survive .
what about this guy ?
there &apos;s only one guy that &apos;s this specific .
name ?
bosola .
i spoke to heather last night .
i knew for a long time something was off but this--
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
mr. sandweiss allison is the victim here .
i just want to know the truth from her for once .
i told you i don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
allison we have the pictures your stepfather took of you .
allison ...
he was always home before mom .
we just talked at first .
why didn &apos;t you tell your mom ?
i knew she &apos;d tell dad and he always said he &apos;d kill anyone
who laid a hand on me .
and did he ?
how long has he been operating ?
20 years .
he &apos;s a ghost .
i &apos;ve heard that name .
bosola .
he &apos;s a character in a play .
jacobean tragedy called the duchess of malfi .
bosola brutally slays the duchess .
it wouldn &apos;t be a tragedy if he didn &apos;t .
is he local ?
i don &apos;t care about the rico beef .
what about sean ?
federal prison out in 2 .
all right .
i &apos;ll bring you bosola tonight .
you better bring the marine corps .
allison did you ever tell anyone
about what your stepfather was doing ?
i told my therapist .
he said i act out because i crave attention .
i &apos;m so sorry daddy .
you have nothing to be sorry for .
we need his name please .
your therapist .
jerry sorum .
am i a suspect ?
not yet mr. sorum .
what is your professional opinion of allison ?
you mean was she sexually abused by her stepfather ?
no question .
and you reported it .
of course .
to the police ?
absolutely .
how far did they take it ?
they had it reviewed by the state .
did the police interview her ?
they came to my office .
allison wanted nothing to do with it .
case closed .
just like the 380.000 cases of child abuse
reported in this country each year .
less than one percent gets to trial .
does that make you want to even the odds ?
every time i listen to a child
vividly recount the most horrific
acts of abuse
done at the hands of a father an uncle
someone they &apos;re supposed to trust ...
it &apos;s all i can do not to break down .
but that &apos;s all i &apos;m capable of .
after that like you
i trust in the justice system .
rossi .
midnight . my restaurant .
most people never meet bosola .
those that do only ever meet him once .
if he smells a fed i &apos;m gonna end up like the duchess .
wow that would be a tragedy .
all right .
i &apos;ve never said anything out of turn ever have i ?
go on .
always you &apos;ve treated me like a son .
but i &apos;d rather do time than see you become a rat and help the feds .
i &apos;m closing the restaurant tonight .
you and the boys take the night off .
i can &apos;t let you do this alone .
i &apos;m not helping the feds .
i &apos;m helping an old friend .
good night . go on .
he dims the lights we go in .
so uh jack &apos;s what 4 today ?
yeah .
and i literally have no idea where he is .
he &apos;s safe .
i saw prentiss and morgan up the block
but the two agents in the sedan
they &apos;re not with us .
that the counter surveillance in case foyet is watching me .
for which apparently there &apos;s no more money .
yeah i heard .
did somebody call you ?
they &apos;re concerned .
what did you say ?
what i &apos;m telling you .
an attack against you is an attack against all of us .
why are you calling ? you ok ?
i hope you got some good guys out there .
this man is a mean son of a bitch .
we &apos;re all over . he &apos;s not gonna know what hit him .
hey that kid--
the uh smart one--
i could use a little help .
reid ?
reid here .
crossword question .
10 letters .
crater creator .
10 letters
crater creator .
arctangent .
did you get that ?
damn she &apos;s smart .
did you see that--
flash ?
i saw that .
he &apos;s already in there .
all units go go go !
morgan &apos;s out canvassing the area .
this whole place is swarming with cops .
we had the streets the building
even the damn roof covered .
how the hell did he get through us ?
garcia traced finnegan &apos;s phone calls .
he made one at 4 : 38 to a pre @-@ paid cell
another one to you at 11 : 41 .
we gave bosola 7 hours to prepare .
i think he was here before we arrived .
and he heard ray call me .
this is all my fault .
now he knows we &apos;re onto him .
he &apos;s not the only one .
whoever he works for does too .
each mutilation represents the crimes
the unsubs believe these 3 individuals committed .
unsubs ?
unknown subjects .
both male. unsub &quot; a &quot; we &apos;re calling the planner .
he works in the criminal justice system .
we &apos;re looking at both defense and prosecution attorneys
judges and even cops .
we believe that the planner has experienced
a devastating personal tragedy of some sort .
and because of the sophisticated nature of the scenario
we believe unsub &quot; a &quot;
is in his late 50s or 60s .
the planner likely met unsub &quot; b &quot; the enforcer
within the court system .
he &apos;s been hired to carry out justice .
now this type of justice does not come cheap .
so the planner has access to substantial cash .
absolutely no attempt was made
to hide the mutilation .
this suggests the planner either doesn &apos;t care what we find
or he wants us to find it .
now the enforcer on the other hand
has no such intentions .
he should be considered armed and extremely dangerous .
thank you .
all right. let &apos;s go people .
all final payments have been made .
i see no reason not to complete the tasks
or to converse further .
good . one last request ...
i would like you to pay special attention
to mr. patton .
i &apos;ve concentrated on the last 3 cases .
they &apos;ve left the freshest e @-@ prints .
great .
not really . over 100.000 cases
pass through long island court .
who had eyes on those files ?
literally hundreds and hundreds of people .
change track . focus on the enforcer .
mob @-@ related murder trials on long island the last 10 years .
we &apos;re looking for a hitman .
hey there are 93 mob trials in the last 10 years .
put aside any trials that resulted in a conviction .
weed out mistrials and arraignments .
uh 19 .
were any of those on trial
suspected of being hitmen or enforcers ?
3 ...
whoa whoa whoa this totally slipped the net .
tony mecacci--his case was judged a mistrial
but check out his suspected victim .
.22 caliber right ?
bull &apos;s @-@ eye .
cross @-@ match our profile of the planner
against all those connected with this trial .
let &apos;s see--prosecuting lawyer garrett daniels
judge boyd schuller
criminal defense lawyer paul ...
wait wait .
did you say judge schuller ?
yeah here &apos;s a photo .
what &apos;s wrong ?
do you know him ?
no . but i knew his wife .
2 years ago she was driving home from work
and she was killed by a drunk driver .
that could be the tragedy .
she was the love of his life that &apos;s for sure .
12 months ago judge schuller took a leave of absence
due to health issues .
he was diagnosed with terminal cancer .
he has 6 months to live .
and that &apos;s when the killing started .
you don &apos;t seriously think judge ...
judge schuller is the planner .
yes i do .
fits the profile .
and tony mecacci is most likely bosola the enforcer .
what have you got on bosola ?
uh he went off the grid after his last trial .
jj put out a statewide apb
and release mecacci &apos;s photo to the media .
judge schuller &apos;s a highly @-@ respected man .
we can &apos;t just walk in there and accuse him of serial murder .
then i &apos;ll go to the attorney general
and petition the chief justice if i have to .
and maybe not .
i believe you &apos;re looking for me .
you know we have to advise you of your rights .
i waive my constitutional rights against self @-@ incrimination .
when you walked in here
you said &quot; i believe you &apos;re looking for me . &quot;
and i was right .
your timing was impeccable .
but how could you know that ?
i knew it wouldn &apos;t take you long to find me .
not after what i &apos;ve left behind .
so you don &apos;t deny any of this ?
why would i ? what you see as a crime
i see as justice .
ray finnegan was a friend of mine .
ray finnegan was a criminal .
you should choose your friends more wisely .
it must have really thrown you
when ray showed up at emma &apos;s funeral .
how do you know about my wife ?
you have absolutely no idea who i am do you ?
ray told rossi you only meet bosola once .
so judge schuller had to have given him a list of names .
he never needs to see him again
just make final payment on proof of death .
have garcia hack into schuller &apos;s files
and track his financial records
before everything gets shut down .
and find out if his office made any calls .
they did . i spoke to them a few hours ago .
i told them we had two suspects .
so he knows we &apos;re onto him .
he came here to stall .
he does have a list . there &apos;s more to come .
could we just get on with what i came here for ?
why ? so bosola can go on and carry on
whatever it is you asked of him to do ? no .
you call him and you end this .
even if i could i wouldn &apos;t .
she was born emma louise taylor
4th of july 1958 .
you could get that from anywhere .
when she was 6 her dad john
brought home a black and white homeless kitten .
if she knew you ...
emma would have told me .
she named it oscar
after oscar wilde .
and of all oscar wilde &apos;s work she loved
an ideal husband the most .
i don &apos;t know how you know all of this about emma
or what you hope to achieve
but we &apos;re done .
you know the charges . charge me .
is that what started all this insanity ...
emma &apos;s death ?
what started all of this was the 35 years
i had to sit and watch
as the system i swore an oath to protect
failed the very people
our justice system was meant to protect .
i wonder what emma would make of all this .
every single person on that list deserves justice
and it &apos;s justice they managed to evade .
so ...
you do have a list .
i &apos;m finished talking .
oh @-@ oh we &apos;ve got gobs of two @-@ way traffic going on
which means someone is trying to bounce us out .
ok bosola didn &apos;t come cheap
so judge schuller had to have made
some pretty substantial transactions .
got wire transfers to a cayman island bank
and that &apos;s where the trace ends .
how many how much ?
june he debits numerations of $ 9.999
every few days total of 4 he takes a break for a few weeks
until he makes his final transaction
for the same magic number .
anything less than $ 10.000 keeps the irs off your trail .
i know that too .
so the final payment must be for proof of death .
that makes $ 50.000 the price of a kill .
he did that 3 times over a period of 12 months
but 2 days ago
he raided his account for $ 100.000 all in one hit .
he also closed all his accounts
and handed his entire estate over
to a victims support group .
someone who isn &apos;t suffering from too many brainiacs
in the high @-@ tech kitchen just bounced us out .
good job .
if our calculations are correct
there are 2 more names on that list .
there are .
every single person on that list deserves justice .
he said deserves not deserved .
now look .
right there . he looked at his watch for the second time .
whatever he &apos;s waiting for is about to happen .
i don &apos;t think you knew emma at all .
at least not the one i knew .
i made an excuse for myself
that i wouldn &apos;t be welcome at her funeral .
but the truth is i couldn &apos;t face it .
you knowing emma changes nothing .
oh but it does .
emma changed the lives of everyone she knew .
but at least ray and i saw her death
for what it truly was ...
a tragic accident .
dan patton was drunk .
he murdered emma
as surely as if he put a gun to her head .
is that why his photo &apos;s not here ?
you &apos;re saving the best for last ?
we need to locate dan patton now .
the 100.000 must be for some serious extras .
how many other people have you targeted ?
i want the truth .
i have nothing more to say .
oh but i do .
i ran into emma by chance
a few years ago
at a hotel in manhattan .
i was working on a case so was she .
i knew she was married .
but i didn &apos;t care .
she ...
she wouldn &apos;t .
no .
emma would not do that to me .
you &apos;re lying .
emma ...
i want the truth .
you first .
dan patton is the last one .
there are no more .
now tell me the truth .
that night in manhattan
she told me our connection was so strong
it could never happen only once .
and i was fine with that .
please . please don &apos;t . i have nothing no money nothing .
nothing--
please please don &apos;t kill me .
this isn &apos;t about money .
this is about the murder of emma schuller .
emma ? oh god .
emma--that was-- that was an accident .
please. no that was an accident .
please--please don &apos;t--
at least ...
you now know what kind of man you &apos;re working with .
what kind of man are you judge ?
i &apos;ve had enough of seeing the guilty
walk free of their sins .
but what about your sins ?
i got cancer for mine .
maybe he &apos;s still at work .
workplace said he left for the day .
dan patton this is the fbi .
clear !
one to the heart one to the head .
we know who did it .
bosola has no way of getting off long island .
they &apos;re moving judge schuller .
what ?
he &apos;s a high court judge .
it makes it a federal case now .
what if bosola has no intention
of leaving the island ?
garcia said the judge was giving his whole estate away ?
his property his money .
he closed out his accounts and paid off his utility bills .
he has cancer but he still has 6 months to live .
is there a reason he &apos;s paying off all his bills now ?
not to mention the 100.000 he made
as a last and final payment for not one but 2 kills .
usually the judge waits for confirmation of death
before making final payment .
only this time he knew he wouldn &apos;t be around to see it .
here he comes !
oh there he is .
judge schuller !
judge schuller is helping us
with a federal investigation .
wait a minute. what ?
i can &apos;t hear you. speak up .
judge schuller does this have anything to do with
the recent rash of murders ?
i am of the belief that justice has been served .
hotch wait a minute. what ?
no comment .
judge schuller can you confirm reports ...
i lied .
what ?
... your status in this case ?
everybody down ! get on the ground !
down on the ground ! stay down !
get down !
she was special to you .
i was just thinking ...
when i first met emma
i knew i would love her for the rest of my life .
we were 12 years old .
she always said we were doomed
to be star @-@ crossed lovers
destined to wonder
what might have been .
i never slept with her you know .
that wasn &apos;t true
what i said to schuller .
that was just to get under his skin
knock him off his game .
i understand .
i should have married her though .
when i left the marines
i was recruited by the bureau
spent a few years on the streets
got involved with starting the bau .
and before i knew it
a lifetime had gone by .
i hear you .
i missed a life with emma
because i became obsessed with the chase .
with the hunt .
dave he &apos;s threatening my family .
and we &apos;ll get foyet aaron .
then what &apos;s your point ?
you have a family .
when all this is over
what are you gonna do ...
to make sure you &apos;re not a lonely guy
wondering why you let the purest thing in your life ...
get away ?
going somewhere ?
hear the joke about the two irishmen--
yeah i heard it .
didn &apos;t find it funny the first time .
&quot; i have always found
that mercy bears richer fruit than strict justice . &quot;
