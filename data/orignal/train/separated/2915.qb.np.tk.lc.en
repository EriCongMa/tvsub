the.one.with.the.videotape
welcome home .
how was the honeymoon ?
great ! how about you ? you &apos;re having a baby !
yeah , we are . it &apos;s so exciting .
i always knew you two would have a child out of wedlock .
look , i have a sonogram picture .
good .
ross , it &apos;s got your wavy , black lines .
now that ross knows , how &apos;d it happen ? when ? how many times ?
monica , that &apos;s not right . start with where .
it happened about six weeks ago .
i got home and ross was there . he &apos;d been hanging out with joey .
you &apos;re welcome , buddy .
yeah , thanks .
i had a lot of work , and ross offered to help .
we had wine , we got to talking .
next thing you know , ross comes on to me .
that &apos;s a little misleading .
what is ?
the lie you just told .
that you came on to me ?
there &apos;s the one !
but you did . let &apos;s be honest .
yes , let &apos;s .
ross . if it helps , i don &apos;t believe you .
it &apos;s not important .
what &apos;s important is , we &apos;re having a baby , not who came on to who .
&quot; whom . &quot;
that &apos;s right .
you kissed me first .
you were begging for it !
you were sending me signals !
i was sending signals ? anyone think that i &apos;d send ross begging signals ?
please , show of hands .
it doesn &apos;t matter what people believe ! it happened .
maybe i need to be more careful . am i sending these signals now ?
you know what ? just drop it .
show me how i begged you .
i can show you ! i have it on videotape .
it &apos;s an expression .
come on , rachel , open up . let me explain .
still won &apos;t let you in , huh ?
no .
i &apos;m just gonna close this door so we can talk about you .
i can &apos;t believe he taped them having sex .
yeah . you gotta tell a girl before you tape her .
such a rookie mistake .
know who has a great camera ?
greg and jenny ?
i want to call them .
let &apos;s call .
ask them if they brought their friends souvenirs .
hello . 8th street deli ?
hang up . you get food poisoning just talking to that place .
sorry , wrong number .
here you go , babe .
hello ? it &apos;s the deli again !
all right , i &apos;ll have a sandwich .
i don &apos;t think this number &apos;s right .
what ?
you got fake @-@ numbered .
what ? people don &apos;t do that .
oh , i think we do .
why would they do that ?
i don &apos;t know .
you were a delight . you asked those great questions .
and you were never funnier . joke , joke , joke ! you were a hoot !
you still got me and phoebe .
excuse me , i don &apos;t want greg and jenny &apos;s rejects .
rachel won &apos;t talk to me . she won &apos;t open the door .
i wonder why , pervert .
okay , i am not a pervert .
that &apos;s , like , the pervert motto .
you raise your hand , put your left hand down your pants and repeat that .
filming rachel was not planned .
here &apos;s what happened . joey can back me up .
a month and a half ago , remember i came to you with a problem ?
the personal thing ?
what personal thing ?
about sex ?
that i hadn &apos;t had sex in months ?
yeah , i knew what you were talking about .
i &apos;d like to talk about something i &apos;m uncomfortable talking about .
sure .
how about you showering with your mom ?
i actually had a topic in mind .
i &apos;m kind of going through a dry spell , sex @-@ wise .
for , like , months ?
five , to be ..
lying . six .
six months ? that &apos;s rough .
it &apos;s not all bad . i &apos;m learning to appreciate the small things , like ..
the sound of a bird and the color of the sky .
the sky &apos;s blue , ross . and i had sex yesterday .
please help me . i have a date tonight .
it has to go well . i &apos;m scared for my health .
i got something . it &apos;s this story that i came up with .
very romantic . any woman that hears it is putty .
tell it to me .
now , you &apos;re gonna want to have sex with me when you hear it .
remember , it is just the story .
i &apos;ll try to control myself .
years ago , i was backpacking across western europe ..
you were backpacking across europe ?
have a nice six more months .
i &apos;m sorry . please , please . you were in western europe , and .. ?
i was outside barcelona , hiking in the foothills of mount tibidabo .
nice .
thanks .
i was at the end of this path , and there was a lake .
very secluded . there were tall trees all around .
it was dead silent . gorgeous .
and across the lake i saw a beautiful woman bathing herself .
but she was crying .
why ?
this is great wine .
it &apos;s from france .
in europe .
western europe .
a few years ago i was backpacking across western europe .
really ?
wait , it gets better .
yeah , i was in barcelona .
i studied for a year in barcelona .
you did ?
yeah . when were you there ?
eighty ..
nine ?
three .
i was 13 ?
so anyway , i was hiking ..
i love hiking !
that &apos;s great !
i was hiking along the foothills of mount tibidaybo ..
i think it &apos;s &quot; tibidabo . &quot;
do you want to tell the story ?
how &apos;d your date go ?
great . i &apos;m across the street having sex right now .
your story sucks .
then you didn &apos;t tell it right .
show me how you did it .
no , i don &apos;t want to .
how long since you seen a girl naked ?
i was backpacking ..
i &apos;m not feeling it .
i was outside barcelona , hiking ..
ross , i &apos;m not hot . are you hot ?
it &apos;s been six months . i &apos;m always hot .
you &apos;re not selling the story . you don &apos;t believe it .
i gotta go , i got a date . but try this .
do what i do before an audition .
i &apos;m not hungry .
no .
use my camera to record yourself and see what you &apos;re doing wrong .
i &apos;ll try that .
now , you &apos;re all set up . good to go . just hit record . good luck .
if you ever have any problem with the ladies , you know i &apos;ll help you out .
that means a lot to me , man .
can i get you anything ? lens cleaner ? your battery okay ?
ross , thank god you &apos;re here . you have to help me .
were you talking to yourself ?
that &apos;s less embarrassing . yes . yes , i was .
when she came in , i totally forgot about the camera .
it kept rolling and recorded everything .
yeah , we &apos;re gonna need to see that tape .
what a great idea ! that &apos;ll get rachel to forgive me .
come on , it &apos;ll be like watching the discovery channel ..
only we &apos;ll know the monkeys .
look , i &apos;m not gonna let you guys watch us .
i haven &apos;t even seen it yet .
i &apos;ll trade you two tapes of me having sex .
thanks , i &apos;m good .
we don &apos;t wanna see the dirty stuff ..
just the stuff leading up to it .
no . rachel &apos;s gonna kill me as it is .
it &apos;s not fair to her . let &apos;s forget the tape .
thank you .
no .
you &apos;re right .
joey , no .
loud and clear .
i don &apos;t get why they &apos;d give us a fake number .
if they knew what they were doing , they didn &apos;t give you real names .
maybe people give out fake numbers , but not fake names .
hi . ken adams . nice to meet you .
regina phalange .
we didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
i know .
although you did tell an awful lot of jokes .
you said they were funny . joke , joke , joke !
joke , joke ..
it was your questions .
what about them ?
the sheer volume . it was like flying with the riddler .
was that another joke ?
was that another question ?
is ross still here ?
watch out , honey . someone else is asking questions now .
no , but he told us what happened . it was an honest mistake .
how would you like it if i had sex with you and i taped it ?
oh , forget it .
there he is , the father of my child , the porn king of the west village .
it was an accident , okay ?
i feel bad . i swear , i didn &apos;t even watch it .
anyway , here .
you might be more comfortable destroying it yourself .
thank you .
what ?
you don &apos;t want to see this , do you ?
hell , yeah !
i am not gonna show you this .
not the sex part . just the stuff leading up to it .
forget it .
we &apos;ll think of another way to put the &quot; who came on to who &quot; thing to rest .
come on now , think !
it &apos;s rachel &apos;s tape , and she can do whatever she wants .
and she wants to destroy it , so end of story .
i want to see it .
what ?
you don &apos;t want us to see this .
you so badly don &apos;t want us to see it that it makes me want to see it .
are we watching the tape or not ?
it &apos;s for your sake .
i don &apos;t believe you .
i think you don &apos;t want them to see you begging me .
rachel , please ?
oh , a little preview .
fine . i want the record to show that i tried to take the high road .
because in about five minutes , i &apos;m gonna be saying ..
okay , here we go .
i &apos;m so happy .
thank god you &apos;re here . help me . were you talking to yourself ?
there i am .
you &apos;re gonna get pregnant .
i screwed up so bad .
i told monica that i &apos;d send those wedding invitations weeks ago .
you didn &apos;t do it ?
i put them in my desk at work , and forgot about them until today .
sweetie , it &apos;s okay . everybody made it to the wedding . i &apos;m fine .
kind of hurting my hand though .
i know .
i can &apos; t believe it , especially after monica went on and on about it .
&quot; here are the invitations , rachel . be very careful , rachel .
please , drinking no liquids around the invitations , rachel . &quot;
did you do it on our invitations ?
not on the ones we sent out .
so just the ones you gave back to us and we had framed ?
it seems like yesterday they just got engaged .
i know .
remember the night they got engaged ? how you and i almost ..
oh , i remember how we almost .
you think we would &apos;ve gone through with it ?
you think we would have done it ?
i know i wanted to . i just wasn &apos; t sure if you did .
oh , i wanted to .
so we both wanted to .
interesting .
anyway , it probably worked out for the best .
yeah , sure .
in about 10 seconds , he kisses me .
in about 5 seconds , you &apos;ll see why .
did i ever tell you about the time i backpacked through western europe ?
get ready to see some begging .
oh , you came on to ross !
what ?
now i &apos;m so happy .
what ?
you used the europe story !
that &apos;s the magic story you use when you want to have sex !
how do you know about that story ?
how do you know about that story ?
my friend irene heard it from some guy .
some guy !
no , she told me that his name was ken adams .
ken adams !
so , people are familiar with the europe story ?
about that , the &quot; who came on to who &quot; thing really doesn &apos;t matter .
it would have happened either way .
if you hadn &apos;t initiated it , i know i would have .
it was an amazing night .
it was . it was amazing .
you think it looked amazing ?
i don &apos;t know . i honestly didn &apos;t watch it .
yeah , me neither .
yet .
that may be weird .
yeah , it would be really weird .
good luck .
good luck to you .
