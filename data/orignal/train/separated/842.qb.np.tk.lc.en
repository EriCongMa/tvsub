no . i wish .
billy from car county started playing misogynist bingo
with me as soon as i walked in the door .
he called me &quot; dollface . &quot;
started pointing out all the room in the trunk
for my shopping bags .
then , he explained four @-@ wheel drive to me .
i don &apos;t need four @-@ wheel drive explained .
it &apos;s very well named .
like world series of poker champion , chris moneymaker .
continue , though .
okay , you know how you get back at this guy ?
huh . you do the entire thing online .
you set up an e @-@ mail address ,
but under a dude &apos;s name .

rhonda &apos;d !
what &apos;s your last name ?
i &apos;m almost done with my &quot; jeff day &quot; e @-@ mail to the dealer .
i &apos;ve constructed a very rich back story for him .
listen to this , listen to this .
okay .
he wrote this while on break from his job ,
which is hanging telephone line .
he should have a desk job by now ,
but the ground has always been trouble for him .
yeah , the poles are safer .
and sometimes , at dusk , he can see his buddies
from desert storm dancing in the static .
that &apos;s beautiful .
yeah , it &apos;s okay .
so you need a dude pass before you send it off , right ?
no , i don &apos;t need a dude pass .
no , no . listen to this .
my wife is on my nuts .
i need two grand off the msrp .
go , clips .
go , clips ! good , yeah .
hey , nick , if anyone &apos;s gonna give jess a dude pass ,
it &apos;s gonna be me .
a dude pass .
not a pretty @-@ boy pass .
not a &quot; i make my money from my mind &quot; pass .
not a &quot; i look like the cute benchwarmer on an nba team ,
but i &apos;m not good enough to play . &quot;
are you done ?
after i take my dude pass ,
why don &apos;t you take a short guy pass ?
why don &apos;t you take a snake voice pass ?
is it frustrating for you when you go to concerts
and you can &apos;t see the stage &apos; cause you &apos;re so short ?
it can be .
it can be !
i know we &apos;re in an awkward situation .
i used to date nick , now i &apos;m dating sam , again .
i thought we were over all this .
and now every time i turn around ,
you guys are in some kind of turf war .
are we in a turf war ? i didn &apos;t even notice , you punk .
this can &apos;t go on forever .
let &apos;s just get our emotions out there .
let &apos;s just express ourselves ...
i &apos;m good .
i don &apos;t ...
i got nothing .
yeah , i mean , everything &apos;s fine .
you feel good ?
yeah , i feel great .
you feel good , i feel good .
yeah , i got nothing to talk about , yeah .
we &apos;re good , man .
i don &apos;t feel nothin &apos; towards you man .
you can spit on the bottom of my shoe , dude .
let &apos;s ...
this is what you want for our nuptials ?
shenanigans ?
this is our wedding , cece ,
not &quot; ernest goes to our wedding . &quot;
can &apos;t we just revoke winston &apos;s plus one ?
okay , look , i &apos;m sure there &apos;s more to rhonda
than just pranks , all right ?
we owe it to winston to get to know her .
well , let &apos;s start at the beginning .
tell us about your childhood . where &apos;d you grow up ?
well , i grew up in baltimore . oh .
i don &apos;t like to talk about it
around new people ,
but we were homeless .
oh , i &apos;m ... i &apos;m so sorry .
i had no idea .
it was tough .
we didn &apos;t have money
for food , clothes , toys .
my brother and i adopted a rat .
i remember , we called the rat singular wireless .
he was sweet .
until he ate my brother &apos;s pinkie toe clean off .
what ?
he bit it like a baby carrot .
just .
it woke me up .
that snap , that snap .
in the end , we laughed about it ,
&apos;cause what else can you do ?
gosh darn it .
he ran away after a while--
my brother , not the rat--
he didn &apos;t get far , obviously , not with nine toes .
listen , it wasn &apos;t a great childhood ,
and i know that i come on strong ,
but i guess , if i can scare people with my pranks ,
then i know i &apos;m not the only one who &apos;s scared .
what a cruel , terrible world we live in .
i had no idea .
i &apos;m so , so , so , sorry .
you &apos;re stupid , schmidt .
and you &apos;re @-@ you &apos;re stupid , too , cece ,
stupid .
okay , wait , so the en ... the en ...
the entire story is a lie ?
rhon . da &apos;d .
need a little more of this .
anybody else want some , uh , wine ?
oh , no , thanks .
i salted it .
you salted the wine ? how is that even a prank ?
you just told her that you salted it before she took a sip .
unless of course that the prank is that there &apos;s no salt in it .
yes , there &apos;s salt .
there &apos;s most definitely salt in that .
this is delightful .
mr. day , i , too , love sons of anarchy .
you drive a pretty hard bargain .
i agree to your terms !
you just have to sign the papers in person .
i &apos;m at the dealership for another hour .
ah , i did not think this through .
nick ... i have hit a snag in my car buying .
i &apos;m not surprised you came to me .
i heard you and , uh , dr . trap @-@ jaw last night ,
and he climaxes like a woman .
that was me .
then you sound like a woman when you climax .
i am a woman .
what &apos;s your point ?
we &apos;re still on your point .
i &apos;m waiting for you to wrap it up .
my point is ...
your car deal went south , and so you need nick miller
to twist some nips for you , yeah ?
nope . the nips have already been twisted .
all i need right now is someone to pretend to be jeff day .
and i would ask sam , but he &apos;s in a procedure all day .
he &apos;s de @-@ webbing some kid &apos;s toes .
it sounds whimsical , but it &apos;s actually very serious .
why would you go to him ?
he cannot close this deal for you , jess .
the deal has already been closed .
right now , i just need , literally , any man .
if i could wish a mannequin to life , i would .
oh , jessica .
you understand that fate fused that kid &apos;s toes together .
and dr. sam is the man for that job ,
but i &apos;m the man for this job .
so if you excuse me ,
let me get my julius pepperwood disguise .
wait , no , no , no . you don &apos;t understand .
i just need you to pretend to be jeff day .
well , i need some sort of disguise .
absolutely not .
what about a mustache ?
that &apos;s a disguise .
not if i grow one .
we &apos;re in the car in ten minutes .
you gonna grow a mustache in ten minutes ?
no man could do that .
scientifically impossible .
hey , i guess science always wins , right ?
see ya in the car .
all right , now remember ,
jeff day is a lovable schnook ,
who makes sausage in his spare time .
you work for the phone company ,
so you call the phones &quot; units . &quot;
all right , what &apos;s my back story ?
units , that &apos;s good . uh , you &apos;re my wife .
you spend all day making sausages ,
and clucking with the other hens on the kitchen unit .
no , no . i &apos;m a disgraced ice @-@ skating sensation .
i got ex @-@ communicated from the sport
for protesting that nudie fabric .
and then i broke my butt .
right , and which toe is webbed ?
ugh , nick , that &apos;s real life .
ugh . this is gonna be a disaster .
abort , abort .
dollface !
you &apos;re back !
hi . i am , i am .
um , i believe you &apos;ve been e @-@ mailing with my husband jeff .
jeff day .
lover of meats , enemy of nonsense .
put her there .
nice mustache .
my guy .
all right .
oh , excuse me for a minute .
i have to go feed the meter .
uh , excu ... before you go ,
can you please fill us in
on all active pranks at this table ?
i think you found them all , okay ?
relax .
oh , wait ! winston ...
i put a watch battery in your huevos rancheros .
in the huevos ?
no , you did not .
winston , she &apos;s been sitting down this whole time .
does she have someone working with her in the kitchen ?
can you explain to me how that &apos;s funny ?
&apos;cause you could have cracked a molar or choked to death .
it &apos;s hilarious , &apos; cause what if i choke on the battery ?
you know what i mean ?
or if the battery breaks open inside of me , you know ?
and causes all kinds of ... no ?
what @-@ what ? you guys don &apos;t like her ?
and i mean , look , i get it .
she might not be the one ,
but come on , at least we &apos;re having fun , right ?
we gave her a chance , okay , winston ?
but i am scared to touch my food ,
and i don &apos;t want to feel that way at our wedding .
yes .
winston , it brings me no joy to do this , whatsoever ,
but i &apos;m revoking your plus one .
you gave me that plus one ,
which means i can bring anyone .
plus one means plus anyone .
for the schmidt @-@ parikh wedding ,
it &apos;s a plus the one .
you just had that one locked and loaded , didn &apos;t you ?
excuse me , sir ? here &apos;s your check .
oh , my god !
that &apos;s my face . why is that my face ?
no , no , no , no .
save it .
it &apos;s gonna be wasted on these two .
let &apos;s get out of here .
how did she get a mask of my face ?
oh ... did they just stick us with the bill ?
n ... no .
she left , like , $ 300 .
who does this prank ?
thanks for meeting with us .
i don &apos;t know ... what made me think
i could have possibly bought a car by myself .
you were right to get your hubby involved .
now , mr. day ,
your mind seemed pretty made up over e @-@ mail .
look , billy , i wish , uh , we could get twin hogs ,
but then the missus would stop giving me
that sweet potato pie .
you know jeff day ,
i need my sweet potato pie every four hours .
ain &apos;t that right , baby ?
i married a hungry man .
if you &apos;re open to other options ,
we just got a consignment of vehicles
that we are looking to move at rock bottom prices .
i had my heart set on that cute little car
that you showed me in that e @-@ mail you wrote .
had a really big makeup mirror , and i sure was excited about it .
there &apos;s no harm in hearing what the catch of the day is , right ?
no harm .
exactly .
billy , jeff needs to take his omega @-@ 3 pill .
could you grab us a glass of water ?
not a problem .
i got a bad ticker myself .
not ... uh ...
i had him right where i wanted him .
he &apos;s trying to bait and switch us ,
and you &apos;re gobbling it up like an old king
with a turkey leg .
you &apos;re leaving money on the table .
i can smell it .
watch . i &apos;m gonna string him along ,
and then i &apos;m going to get you a better deal .
he thinks he &apos;s fishing for me .
nah , i &apos;m fishing for him , but from the water .
you &apos;re in way over your head .
right where a fish wants to be .
here &apos;s your water , and ...
take as many mouse pads as you want .
quit stalling me .
smart .
tell me about the secret stash , billy .
these vehicles are a lot bigger
than what you were e @-@ mailing about .
well , a car can never be too big ,
and a pie can never be too sweet .
i hear ya , so i guess ,
don &apos;t waste your time with anything smaller
than a two liter ?
two liter ?
i want a car , not a mountain dew .
you want to send this girl out on to the road with a little bulk ,
in case she gets hit , or more likely ,
hits someone , am i right ?
while she &apos;s text messaging .
they can &apos;t stop .
they &apos;re beautiful , but ...
i like you .
honey , don &apos;t forget how much research you put in .
you don &apos;t want to throw that all away ,
like i did with my skating career .
jeff , you clearly know your way around an engine .
what are we talkin &apos; , 5.0 ?
you want the bird to sing in my underpants ,
i &apos;m gonna need double digits .
oh , yeah .
jeff .
baby !
it &apos;s gonna sing .
boom .
you get me .
excuse me . i have to take this .
it &apos;s oksana baiul .
honey , get the car i want ,
or the only pie you &apos;ll be eating is out of the garbage .
hey , i thought you were de @-@ webbing .
well , it took less time than i thought .
yeah , he only wanted his big toe free ,
so he could wear flip @-@ flops .
how &apos;s the new car ?
don &apos;t make a thing out of it ,
but i had to ask nick to be jeff day .
you asked nick for help , not me ?
well , you were in surgery ,
and he was the only person i could find ,
but he &apos;s screwing it up so much
that i really wish i &apos;d &quot; reverse @-@ tootsie &apos;d . &quot;
of course he &apos;s screwing up . he &apos;s a little human porkchop .
i &apos;m on my way .
wait , don &apos;t come . don &apos;t come .
i could be jeff day .
i just need to find a fake mustache .
what is it with you guys and mustaches ?
look , i have the situation un @-@ under control .
cutting winston &apos;s plus one creates a real ripple effect .
jason gets bumped from 14 .
ruthie gets bumped from 6,
landing tyler right next to the bar ,
which feels like tempting fate .
yeah , you know what ? the more i think about it ,
we may have judged rhonda a little too harshly .
maybe you &apos;re right . you know what ?
if winston is happy , with lady kutcher ,
we should support him .
what &apos;s the worst that can happen ?
maybe she &apos;ll put some cellophane over the toilet bowls .
hopefully , my uncle randy doesn &apos;t get
fired up at the buffet .
hey , guys .
we were just talking , and we &apos;re sorry about earlier .
oh , listen , i &apos;ve been thinking about what you said ,
and maybe you &apos;re right .
i want the woman that i bring to your wedding to be special .
special like ...
my wife .
we got married !
what ? !
you got married ?
you guys said to be more serious ,
and nothing &apos;s more serious than holy matrimony .
i mean , this is what you guys wanted , right ?
no ! no ! this is insane .
and we were totally out of bounds in the first place .
we never should have interfered
in your love life .
no .
got you again !
boom !
that &apos;s what we needed to hear .
huh ? wait . what ?
what , so you ... wait a minute .
you &apos;re not actually married ?
oh , thank ... thank goodness .
it was ... it was just a prank .
it was just a prank .
just a prank .
okay . how did you guys get such a realistic marriage certificate ?
does it look realistic ?
oh , that &apos;s good . they did a good job on it ,
&apos;cause it &apos;s a hundred percent real .
we got you .
we found a same @-@ day chapel ,
and then we got married ,
as a prank .
wha @-@ uh ... ?
so @-@ so you really did get married ?
y &apos;all can &apos;t keep up .
how is really getting married , winston , a prank ?
the authenticity of the marriage
is what makes it a great prank .
come on , guys .
yeah .
says who ?
hold on . wh ... no , please .
let them explain . please explain .
we &apos;ve already explained it .
a simple prank is a strong prank .
okay .
let &apos;s just say ... i don &apos;t know ,
i told you that i cut my pinkie finger off ,
and then i actually cut my pinkie finger off .
is that a prank ?
is that a prank ?
well , i would not see that coming .
okay .
different direction .
let @-@ let &apos;s say that i @-@ i told you
that i invested all of my money
into boogie boards .
that &apos;s just a lie .
and then i took you to my accountant &apos;s office ,
and sitting behind the desk
was just a little crab in sunglasses .
hmm , still sounds like a lie .
and then my real accountant came out
and showed you the books
and , in fact , i had invested
all of money in boogie boards .
that &apos;s definitely a prank .
yeah , that would get me . that &apos;s @-@ that &apos;s a good one .
that &apos;s crazy , yeah . that &apos;s a good one .
that &apos;s a good one .
i don &apos;t understand this .
okay , so this is like a lifelong prank ?
oh , no , no , we &apos;re getting it annulled tomorrow .
oh , right . tonight &apos;s the honeymoon .
listen , a little marriage advice--
i would know because i &apos;m married--
a happy wife , uh , a happy life .
have you heard the saying before ?
i &apos;m questioning everything right now .
i swear .
he &apos;s about 5 &apos; 10 . &quot;
maybe a mustache .
sometimes he just sits in the bathroom buying music .
do you think you could check in there ?
is that him in the rv ?
oh , no .
he wouldn &apos;t be in an rv .
he is , he is . that &apos;s him in the rv .
you look natural behind the wheel of that baby .
i felt like myself for the first time in my life .
hey , jeff .
where were you ,
and why weren &apos;t you answering your unit ?
excuse me .
yeah .
good stuff , billy . thank you .
is this you doing your plan ?
i don &apos;t know .
he keeps changing things up .
he &apos;s very good at his job .
hey , how ya doin &apos; ? i &apos;m jeff day .
my brother .
geoff with a &quot; g. &quot;
yeah , i came as soon as i could .
i don &apos;t know why .
i explicitly told you not to .
yeah , why don &apos;t you take a hike ? no one needs you here .
the reason she came to me first .
sorry , billy .
there &apos;s a little bit of bad blood
between my brother and my husband .
she may have come to you for help ,
but you &apos;re clearly not getting the job done ,
which is why she &apos;ll always come back for my help .
as soon as you get a helping of my help ,
you &apos;re never the same .
no one helps me better than i help myself .
i told you if you &apos;d just guide me .
let &apos;s not get into that now .
i don &apos;t really know what you guys are talking about ,
but are you still buying the rv ?
no ! i &apos;m not buying an rv .
honey , he &apos;s giving us a great price .
why don &apos;t you get those numbers ?
don &apos;t get those numbers .
why don &apos;t you go get them ?
stay right there .
why do women always bring your drama in here ?
oh , you &apos;re blaming me ?
hah ! all right .
i &apos;d like to test @-@ drive my car right now .
i showed you where all the mirrors are , right ?
now you guys are listening to me !
get ready for the scariest test @-@ drive of your lives .
i don &apos;t care if you &apos;re hot .
i &apos;m always cold !
slow down ! oh , man , this speed ...
you &apos;re gonna give me what i want .
i can &apos;t give you a thing
until i talk to my manager .
you &apos;re talking to me . i know you need to
get rid of this 2017 .
it &apos;s the end of the month .
i know you haven &apos;t made your nut .

jess , you don &apos;t get it .
the stuff between sam and i is deep guy stuff .
it &apos;s untalkable .
that &apos;s right . i punched him twice .
and i stole his girlfriend .
we &apos;re talking about adultery and violence .
that part of the male brain has not been civilized .
so you &apos;re just gonna feud forever ?
i &apos;ll teach my sons to hate his sons
and i expect the same from him .
you got it .

if you insist on hating each other ,
do it while i &apos;m not around .
the moment i walk in the room ,
i want some convincing dude on dude friendship stuff .
i want high @-@ fives .
i want golf tips .
when a hot waitress walks by ,
i want to see a real nudge @-@ nudge .
