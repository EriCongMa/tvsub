you have the ability to keep living inside someone else &apos;s body .
talk to me . did it work ?
of course it worked .
i &apos;m katherine pierce .
i &apos;m diane freeman ,
head of campus security .
your roommate took her own life .
so tell me .
now that you &apos;ve slept with klaus ,
how was it ?
oh , my god .
katherine pierce
has permanent control of elena gilbert &apos;s body .
we need to talk .
you are the good ,
and i need a little good in my life ...
i &apos;m sorry , damon .
we &apos;re over .
we &apos;ve been waiting for you .
does elena know that you &apos;re here ?
see , elena thinks i &apos;m a monster .
she &apos;s right .
now that &apos;s the damon salvatore i remember .
dear diary , i love my life .
seriously , becoming elena gilbert is
the best thing that has ever happened to me .
i finally have everything i ever wanted .
i &apos;m young ,
healthy ,
gorgeous .
everyone loves me ,
but best of all , i &apos;m a vampire again ,
so rest in peace , elena .
thanks for giving me your perfect life ,
and now that i &apos;ve corrected
the single worst decision you ever made--
falling in love with damon salvatore--
i &apos;m gonna win back the one thing
i &apos;ve always wanted .
so we all agree ?
no more moping about life &apos;s little failures
and no more dabbling in the dark arts of boyfriends past .
this is a fresh start .
couldn &apos;t agree more .
i happen to love fresh starts .
um , i haven &apos;t been moping or dabbling .
no one likes a bragger , bonnie .
hey . do you mind if i share ?
great . thanks . appreciate it .
today is the dawning of a new era .
this is stage one in our metamorphosis into the land of the brave ,
the free , and the single .
bonnie &apos;s not single .
bonnie &apos;s best friends are single ,
which makes her single adjacent .
so she can be our wingwoman .
&quot; whitmore &apos;s annual bitter ball ,
a night to celebrate broken hearts ,
jilted lovers , and bitter singles . &quot;
this is our fresh start ?
no . this is our purge , our cleanse .
this is where we rid ourselves from the baggage
better known as our tragic and mortifying first semester .
i &apos;ll drink to that .
bonnie !
bonnie , you in ?
yeah . yeah . that sounds like fun .
sorry about the mess .
i had some company , and things got a little out of hand .
you want to tell me what the hell &apos;s going on out in the driveway ?
i let enzo drive last night .
he is a little out of practice .
almost ended up in the damn foyer .
you mean aaron .
yeah .
yeah . well , last night , we hunted him down ,
and i ripped his throat out .
yeah . i just figured it &apos;s time
to shove the last branch of the whitmore family tree into the ...
wood chipper .
so elena breaks up with you ,
and your first instinct is to go a killing spree ?
could you be any more predictable ?
it was my idea if it makes you feel any better .
enzo . remember ? we met when--
when you were trying to tear damon &apos;s head off .
yeah . i remember .
so , what , you guys are old pals again ,
murder buddies , is that it ?
well , you know how it goes .
i mean , i left him for dead ,
he tried to kill me ,
we worked things out .
you spend 5 years with someone in a dungeon ,
you have a pretty unbreakable bond .
say , you haven &apos;t heard from dr. wes maxfield by any chance ?
bloke &apos;s next on the augustine hit list ,
and he &apos;s a slippery little devil .
is that the plan ?
kill off augustine
and then go back to your sadistic , psychotic old self ?
i happen to like my old sadistic self , stefan .
in fact , i miss that guy .
that guy was dumb enough to try and change himself to get a girl .
so get another hobby , brother ,
because i &apos;m not in the mood to be saved .
what do you say ?
shall we get you a new hobby ?
golf ...
scrapbooking ?
scrapbooking .
come on , damon .
you &apos;re better than this .
on the contrary , brother .
i &apos;m better like this .
hey , stefan . um , it &apos;s me .
i was just , uh , wondering--
i mean , i know things are kind of crazy
and you &apos;re probably busy ,
but maybe you might want to come to campus
and we can get a drink or , i don &apos;t know , talk .
so you &apos;re trying to get back with stefan ?
i didn &apos;t ask you to editorialize .
i asked you if that was something that elena would say .
yeah , i guess .
walk away and forget this conversation .
are you happy ?
can i leave now ?
no . stay close .
matt is my elena gilbert cheat sheet .
i didn &apos;t go through all the drama
of taking over this body so that i could be outed
because i didn &apos;t know bonnie &apos;s middle name ,
which is sheila by the way .
you promised we would spend some time together .
how long do you expect me to sit around the mmystic grill
like some sad , lonely bar fly ?
oh , please . don &apos;t pretend that baby @-@ sitting matty blue eyes
is some sort of hardship .
i mean , didn &apos;t you lure him into your bed in prague ?
i didn &apos;t lure him ,
and i wasn &apos;t compelling him to forget everything .
he &apos;s not a puppet .
ah . ok . i get it . you like him .
that &apos;s adorable .
ok . i &apos;m honing up now .
hello . how are you holding up ?
what &apos;s going on ?
who are you ?
my name is dr. wes maxfield ,
and you &apos;re joey , right ?
i saw your name stitched on your work shirt when i grabbed you .
apologies , but i never managed to make proper acquaintance
of the janitorial staff before the hospital lots its funding .
it &apos;s depressing , isn &apos;t it ?
the economy is no friend to medicine .
what do you want from me ?
i don &apos;t have any money .
ironically , joey , neither do i.
what did you do to me ?
why am i so hungry ?
well , in simple terms , i turned you into a vampire .
now i &apos;m gonna condition you to feed on other vampires
instead of humans .
what ? you &apos;re what ?
would you believe that i &apos;ve already done it once ?
now all i have to do is replicate it .
research is just money and time .
i &apos;ve got time . i &apos;ll find money .
perhaps i can help you with that .
who the hell are you ?
i &apos;m judging your crappy lab .
still didn &apos;t catch your name .
sloan , and i &apos;m here to help you ,
so you can lose the arrogance .
i &apos;m here to offer you new funding for your research .
what do you know about my research ?
i &apos;ve been tracking your augustine experiments for months .
so in return for money and protection ,
i have some blood i want you to analyze .
sorry , but i &apos;m done getting into bed with mysterious benefactors ,
and i don &apos;t need your protection .
i beg to differ .
this is aaron &apos;s bag .
where &apos;d you get this ?
i hate to be the one to tell you this ,
but aaron whitmore &apos;s car was found abandoned
in the middle of the road last night .
no .
no one has seen or heard from him .
he &apos;s dead , isn &apos;t he ?
my guess is , yes , he &apos;s dead ,
and more to the point , you &apos;re next .
so once we &apos;ve finished off this augustine mess ,
what do you say we do a road trip ?
i was thinking south america , cape horn .
sailed past but never stopped over .
i &apos;m not thinking that far ahead .
rise and shine , diane .
how &apos;s our favorite head of whitmore security ?
oh , that &apos;s ironic , isn &apos;t it , you know ,
since we broke in and kidnapped you from your office .
let me go , please .
i have two kids .
a mother . ah . interesting .
well , then you can imagine how heartbreaking
it would be to learn that your child committed suicide ,
especially when said child was actually murdered by a vampire ,
a murder covered up by you .
i didn &apos;t do any such thing .
now , diane , tell the truth .
did you cover up a vampire attack on campus
by forging a suicide note or two ?
yes .
ah . looks like the vervain is officially out of her system .
now i want you to tell me exactly where
i can find dr . wes maxfield .
i have no idea .
i haven &apos;t heard from him in days .
well , that &apos;s a shame , diane ,
because that makes you a dead end .
well , technically .
now she &apos;s a dead end .
on to the next .
i see damon &apos;s got you on shallow grave duty .
be a mate . grab a shovel .
i &apos;ll pass . buried enough skeletons out here .
i &apos;m sensing a metaphor .
i think you need to find yourself a new best friend .
damon &apos;s in a bad place right now ,
and you &apos;re not really making things better .
i know you just got out of captivity
and you &apos;re looking to blow off a boatload of steam ,
which is fine .
just ... do me a favor .
leave my brother out of it .
he mentioned you were a bit of a do @-@ gooder .
yeah .
you know what makes somebody walk a straight line ?
when they have no choice but to be the balance
for somebody who &apos;s about to fall off the edge .
ah , but it &apos;s so much more fun
when you can just commit to the leap .
you &apos;re welcome to join in on the fun .
looks like you could use it .
good man .
why don &apos;t you be a mate , huh ?
get in that car , start driving ,
don &apos;t look back .
you think that hurts ?
i &apos;m curious , stefan .
what do you think you can possibly do to me
that hasn &apos;t been done a hundred times before ?
go on . give it your best shot .
what i do to you , enzo , will be final .
you got it ?
be sure i never see you again .
good ! you &apos;re back !
i need your help .
diamond or dangler ?
since when does elena gilbert accessorize ?
since she &apos;s being conned to go to the bitter ball
with her best friend susie sunshine .
look . you &apos;re not fooling anyone .
i know that you &apos;re faking it .
faking ? i &apos;m what ?
please . it is so obvious .
i appreciate it , i do ,
but you know i &apos;m on edge because of the whole tyler @-@ klaus thing ,
so you are pretending that breaking up with damon was no big deal .
caroline forbes , how do you always see right through me ?
look , elena . you don &apos;t have to pretend with me ,
and if you don &apos;t want to go tonight , it &apos;s all good .
i can be bitter , party of one .
do you think stefan would want to come ?
i was--heh--just about to call you .
hey . listen . i need to talk to you ,
but i didn &apos;t want to do it over the phone .
what &apos;s wrong ?
let &apos;s just say it involves enzo .
enzo . uh ... ok .
then maybe we should meet in person .
actually , caroline &apos;s dragging me to this whitmore thing
for lonely hearts .
i think you should come .
yeah . no , thanks . i already did the college thing .
twice actually .
please .
if it &apos;s bad , then i &apos;ll owe you a fun time .
give me whatever will obliterate the memory of caroline .
i thought you said you weren &apos;t drinking anymore .
no . i said i wasn &apos;t drinking alone today .
she &apos;s new .
whatever you &apos;re thinking , unthink it .
that &apos;s katherine &apos;s daughter ,
and the psycho doesn &apos;t fall far from the tree .
i can hear you , you know ?
you locked me in a safe and buried me alive .
i &apos;m sorry , but i was trying to save my mother &apos;s life ,
and i failed , so if you don &apos;t mind ,
i &apos;d like to sit here and grieve in peace .
you want a shot ?
i want a shot .
let &apos;s do shots .
what ?
well , you heard her .
she &apos;s sorry , her mom &apos;s dead .
let &apos;s do shots .
it &apos;s your funeral .
my mom was so afraid i &apos;d flunk the eighth grade and embarrass her ,
she actually wrote an entire english paper for me .
my mother was so desperate for companionship ,
she compelled an entire town to be her friend .
cheers !
my mom hooked up with you .
oh , my god . seriously ?
afraid so .
drink , both of you .
kind of forgot about that one .
up top !
i have to pee .
hybrids pee ?
there &apos;s got to be a fire hydrant joke in there somewhere .
hilarious .
pour another round .
who &apos;s enzo ?
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;ve never met him .
but you &apos;ve heard of him .
he &apos;s damon &apos;s buddy from augustine .
they were cellmates for 5 years .
i think he &apos;s free or something .
thank you .
forget everything i &apos;ve said since tyler left .
so we &apos;re going to a dance ,
but we can &apos;t show up together
because you can &apos;t bring a date ?
told you it was weird .
better idea . let &apos;s get another hotel room instead .
caroline would kill me .
bonnie , we &apos;re happy .
can &apos;t we just act like it ?
you know what ? you &apos;re right .
i am happy .
it &apos;s like driving past a car crash except you want to look away .
what are you doing here ?
i tutor some kids in calculus .
you know , i like giving back ,
be a good role model .
kidding !
i &apos;m here to kidnap your boyfriend .
you &apos;re not funny .
let &apos;s get out of here .
you &apos;re not going anywhere , buddy .
let go of him .
or what ? you &apos;ll glare at me to death ?
you don &apos;t have your little magic wand to back you up anymore , bon @-@ bon .
leave her alone .
relax . i &apos;m here for you , not her , you idiot .
keep up . anyway , i have this hit list ,
and i can &apos;t find my last target ,
so basically , i need a witch .
ok . well , you just said it . i can &apos;t do magic anymore ,
so go away .
grams ran occult studies .
i &apos;m sure we could throw a rock and hit a witch around here .
so listen . take this--
this is wes &apos; blood .
my buddy enzo kept this as a souvenir .
now this should jump @-@ start a locator spell .
ticktock .
are you deaf ? she is not helping you .
you &apos;re not gonna hurt me .
elena would--
elena would what ? hurt me , dump me ?
been there , done that ,
wrote the country song .
kill you .
she would kill you .
cool . and then me and her all her doppelgangers
could start a baseball team on the other side .
what have i missed ?
she denied your request yet ?
can we get on to the fun bit ?
who the hell are you ?
the one who gets people to do things they don &apos;t want to do .
stop !
stop ! ok . fine . i &apos;ll help !
dead corsage ?
thank you .
hey ! you made it .
i did .
so who thinks up these things ?
lonely single people .
come on .
see ? as promised , fun .
you seem good .
i got the same reaction from caroline
like i &apos;m not allowed to smile or something .
did i say that ?
no , but i see your look .
oh , i have a look ?
yeah . that look .
i &apos;m fine . you don &apos;t have to worry about me .
i &apos;m greatly actually .
i &apos;m the only non @-@ bitter person at this bitter ball .
elena , listen .
i need to talk to you about something .
damon--he got himself into some bad stuff .
yeah . well , it &apos;s what damon does .
if he gets the tiniest bit hurt ,
he lashes out .
he doesn &apos;t think , he doesn &apos;t try .
he just acts ,
and for the longest time ,
i tried to fix him .
i &apos;d try to change him ,
but i think he ended up changing me ,
and i &apos;m not sure that i like the person that i &apos;ve become .
i mean , do you ?
do i what ?
do you like who i am ,
or do you miss who i was ?
elena , i--
let &apos;s change the subject .
what did you want to tell me ?
what did enzo and damon do now ?
you know what ? could we talk about it later ?
is that ok ?
it &apos;s fine by me .
do you mind if i borrow her for a minute ?
she promised that she &apos;d join me at the shredding station .
sure . yeah , no . she &apos;s all yours .
thanks !
shredding station ?
nadia &apos;s not compelling me .
really ? where the hell &apos;s your vervain ?
right here .
you see ? she swiped it
and probably compelled you not to notice .
why would nadia be compelling me ?
i have no idea .
is there any vervain here ?
yeah . sheriff forbes makes me put it in the coffee .
drink some now .
did you bring anything to shred ?
no , because i didn &apos;t realize people still printed photos .
ok . do you feel cleansed ?
almost .
tyler drew you a horse ?
no . klaus did .
clean sweep .
yes . i am making a decision .
these relationships are over .
over .
i &apos;m not going to change my mind
just because i &apos;m feeling bored or nosta or lonely .
wait . are you doing that thing
where you &apos;re talking about yourself
but really you &apos;re talking about me ?
i &apos;m just saying that you &apos;ve been through a lot lately .
and your emotions are all over the place .
so are stefan &apos;s .
i think that making yourself so available
could maybe be confusing things .
do you think that i &apos;m leading him on ?
no . i didn &apos;t say that .
i just--i ...
just forget it . just--just forget everything i said .
ok .
makes me so happy i &apos;m not 19 and stupid .
all right , bonnie .
where &apos;s your little witch friend ?
liv parker . she &apos;s in one of my classes ,
and she &apos;s not my friend .
i looked her up , found out she works events catering .
this is a total shot in the dark .
well , i &apos;m feeling lucky .
come on . come be bitter with me .
oh , no , no , no . you are the second person
that i didn &apos;t come here to dance with .
ok . then what are you not telling elena ?
way to eavesdrop , caroline .
you came to a dance of your own free will .
something is up .
ok . fine . damon fell off the deep end .
uh , what do you mean exactly by deep end ?
for starters , he killed elena &apos;s friend aaron .
he--what ?
yeah , and i came here to tell her ,
but we were dancing , and she seemed so happy ,
and i just couldn &apos;t .
you think if you tell her what he did
that she &apos;ll give up on him forever ?
yeah . i know she will , and i don &apos;t think
i &apos;ll be able to pull damon back from that .
i mean , i &apos;ve seen damon at his worst , caroline .
and i actually think he enjoys the way it makes him feel .
it &apos;s like the more pain he can cause ,
the more reasons there are for people to hate him .
he wants to confirm everyone &apos;s lowest expectations of him .
and i just honestly don &apos;t know how to fight that side of him .
why all the dramatics , brother ?
what are you doing here ?
bonnie , what &apos;s going on ?
oh , don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m not her date .
we &apos;re not gonna break any bitter ball rules .
how about you just answer the damn question ?
well , bonnie is gonna find me a witch
to do a locator spell on the elusive dr. wes maxfield .
she &apos;s gonna find him , i &apos;m gonna kill him .
bon @-@ bon , should i tell them ?
enzo has jeremy .
if i don &apos;t get a witch to find wes by midnight ,
he &apos;ll kill him .
hypothetical question .
if jeremy gilbert &apos;s life was hanging by a thread ,
could i credibly just let him die ?
because his death would be really convenient for me .
are you seriously making a pros and cons list ?
are there any cons ?
because i &apos;ve only listed pros .
katherine .
i &apos;m just saying his death would earn me ,
a lot of tenderness and sympathy from stefan .
if jeremy is in danger ,
elena would do everything in her power to save his life .
you know that .
but stefan is here . we were dancing .
it was good .
and i think he was even flirting with me ,
which is very naughty , even for him .
listen . if you don &apos;t start acting like you care ,
they will figure out you &apos;re not elena .
so if i happen to know exactly where he is ,
i &apos;m supposed to go and put my life in danger
to save that little rug rat &apos;s life ?
do you know where he is ?
he &apos;s at that hideous whitmore house .
i recognize it from the picture .
apparently i &apos;m the only one who &apos;s been to a whitmore tea party .
save him now !
ok . fine , but in the meantime ,
i &apos;m gonna need you to find out from matt
if caroline has feelings for stefan .
because she &apos;s really starting to grate .
i need to know what i &apos;m up against .
who keeps calling you ?
does caroline have feelings for stefan ?
caroline ? i have no idea .
think . has elena ever been worried
caroline might steal stefan away ?
have they ever fought about him ?
not that i know of .
so you think elena can win stefan back ?
why are you asking me about elena ?
forget we had this conversation .
so was i right ?
ty , you &apos;re not gonna believe what i &apos;m about to tell you .
you &apos;re not going to tell him anything .
you ok ?
i just can &apos;t lose jeremy again .
stefan , please .
help me save him .
this room &apos;s off limits .
look . under normal circumstances ,
i &apos;d probably try to warm up to you ,
be your friend or something .
but i &apos;m kind of under a time crunch ,
and i need your help .
am i supposed to know you ?
we &apos;re in sociology together .
i &apos;m bonnie .
my grams sheila bennett used to teach here , occult studies .
never heard of it or her , so ...
i know you &apos;re a witch .
i saw you spin that pen this morning .
i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
you don &apos;t have to be scared .
i used to be one , too .
yeah . no . try the campus coven club or something .
i really need your help .
even if i wanted to help , i couldn &apos;t .
i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m doing .
i &apos;m just some freak , ok ?
now leave me alone .
oh , my god !
what the hell are you ?
you &apos;re gonna help my friend .
do i need to say it slower ?
vampires are real . ok . that makes sense .
actually , that makes no sense .
concentrate . forget about the vampires .
focus on tapping into your power ,
listen to the sound of your heart beating ,
the sound of your lungs filling with air .
how long &apos;s this gonna take ?
for a newbie witch to learn a complicated spell
under massive stress ?
i have no idea . bonnie ?
repeat after me .
phesmatos tribum
nas ex viras ,
sequitas sanguinem .
wait . what ?
just relax .
phesmatos tribum ...
phesmatos tribum ...
nas ex viras ...
nas ex viras ...
sequitas sanguinem .
sequitas sanguinem .
now keep your eyes closed
and use the blood to find wes .
i have no idea what he looks like .
you don &apos;t have to .
phesmatos tribum
nas ex viras ,
sequitas sanguinem .
phesmatos tribum
nas ex viras ,
sequitas sanguinem .
that a good sign ?
i can &apos;t do this .
just concentrate . try again .
i can &apos;t do this .
don &apos;t you get it ?
i &apos;ve done horrible things .
i &apos;ve set buildings on fire ,
i &apos;ve hurt people .
i can &apos;t control any of it .
witchy hotline . how my i help you ?
damon speaking .
what &apos;taking so long ?
they seem to have lost motivation .
maybe you can inspire them .
with pleasure .
let them know jeremy will be dead very soon .
thank you .
what are you doing ?
damon , call him back right now
and you tell him to stop .
damon , call him back !
just so you know ,
cooperation &apos;s not optional .
damon tells me your sweetheart hasn &apos;t come through on your behalf .
what are you gonna do ?
i &apos;m sure killing me would really inspire her .
you know , you &apos;re right .
she &apos;ll think i &apos;m just some cliche murderer .
i really like to make a good impression , you know ?
you don &apos;t have to do this .
you see , that &apos;s the thing about threats .
if there &apos;s no follow @-@ through ,
no one takes you seriously .
sorry to make this about me .
see ? wasn &apos;t so bad .
i &apos;ve done bad things , too , ok ?
i &apos;ve broken windows , i &apos;ve set more fires than i can count .
is that supposed to make me feel better ?
i &apos;m saying i learned how to control it .
i can teach you the same thing .
this is jeremy .
he &apos;s cute .
yeah , he is ,
and his life is literally in your hands .
ok . but if i go all carrie and burn the school down ,
it &apos;s on you .
ok .
jeremy !
damn it , jeremy !
you should have left when i told you to .
did i give the impression i was taking orders from you ?
my bad .
come on !
come on ! wake up , jeremy .
thank god .
stefan , help me !
you missed all the fun .
spell worked . wes is in richmond .
brilliant . i &apos;ll drive .
damon ...
don &apos;t bother coming back .
i wasn &apos;t planning on it .
what happened ? where &apos;s nadia ?
sorry . slight misunderstanding .
she snapped my neck .
what the hell kind of misunderstanding is that ?
you were right . she was compelling me
but only because she wanted to talk about katherine
and she knew i was pissed at her .
i guess they didn &apos;t really settle their
mother @-@ daughter issues before she died .
she wanted to talk about katherine ?
yeah , but she knew that you would go after her
if you knew she was frying my mind .
i guess she &apos;s got that whole stone @-@ cold survival thing going .
like mother , like daughter .
a little friendly advice .
stay the hell away from her .
yep . i plan on it .
you call me if she gives you any more hassle .
i took care of it .
if he follows us , i &apos;ll kill you both .
i said i took care of it .
earlier on the phone , you weren &apos;t talking to elena .
you were talking to someone who needed information .
do yourself a favor and stop asking questions .
your boyfriend once planted himself inside my brain .
that &apos;s how you were planning on saving katherine .
she didn &apos;t die , did she ?
she jumped inside elena .
the only thing easier than breaking your neck
is taking off your magic life ring .
do you understand ?
what are you gonna do with me ?
i haven &apos;t decided yet .
first , we need to get the vervain out of your system ,
so what do you say ?
paper , scissors , stone for who gets to give
dr. frankenstein his fatal blow .
nah . he &apos;s all yours .
now don &apos;t tell me you &apos;re having second thoughts about leaving home .
i was there for elena .
we &apos;re done . no reason to go back .
what about your brother ?
you saw his face . i know that look .
he &apos;s done with me , too .
and you are ?
my backup .
you got to be kidding me .
what is this ? agh ! more witches ?
close .
travelers .
good luck making new friends , damon .
you ok ?
oh . um , you know , actually ,
would you mind ?
i think i still have a splinter in my back .
yeah . sure .
yeah . there it is .
try not to move .
sorry .
i think i know what you wanted to tell me tonight , stefan .
got it .
damon killed aaron , didn &apos;t he ?
you walked right through the threshold at the whitmore house .
you couldn &apos;t have done that
if the owner hadn &apos;t been dead .
aaron was the owner .
yeah . i--i should have told you . sorry .
why didn &apos;t you ?
i thought that we ...
maybe i don &apos;t deserve anything from you ,
but i thought we could be honest with each other
no matter what .
you want me to be honest ?
yes .
all right .
truth is , ever since the first time
i noticed you falling for my brother ,
i have been waiting for him to screw something up
so badly that you hate him ,
so i &apos;ve been waiting and watching him do all these horrible things ,
and then every single time i think that he &apos;s gone too far ,
he &apos;s there for you ,
sometimes in ways better than i ever was .
so the truth is after a while ,
i just stopped waiting for him to fail
because i liked the person that he had become ...
and i don &apos;t want to lose that person .
he threatened my brother .
stefan , i can &apos;t go back to that .
i know .
but if you want to save him from himself ,
then i &apos;ll help you
but not for myself and not for him .
for you .
what--what &apos;d he stick you with ?
i don &apos;t know .
come here .
i can tell you , if he stuck me
with that cannibal vampire poison ,
we might have a little problem .
what kind of problem ?
wes has this sick little scheme
to destroy vampires by making them feed on each other .
you hear that ?
can you get me out of here ?
i don &apos;t want to be here .
i need to get out .
thanks . i owe you .
what &apos;s happening to you ?
i &apos;m gonna go ahead and say karma .
karma &apos;s happening to me .
damon ? damon , stop !
ok .
