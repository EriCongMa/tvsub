that &apos;s in six days .
we submitted a delinquency letter three weeks ago .
reports had been filed .
i know i &apos;m behind ,
but i @-@ i &apos;m owed unemployment ,
and my sister said that she can help make the difference up .
yeah , i wish there was something more i could do .
you can &apos;t kick us out !
i have a second job interview tomorrow --
it &apos;s out of my hands .
shots fired , colon , multiple , period .

第82号
the answer is no .
i gave up one life .
do you think i &apos;m gonna start over , do it all again ? !
you &apos;re crazier than i imagined !
you can &apos;t go back to philadelphia . it &apos;s too dangerous .
what do you think i &apos;m gonna do ? stay here in -- in this ?
i can &apos;t believe you brought me here .
i &apos;ll tell you where i &apos;m gonna go -- home , with my husband .
frank has two daughters .
you think he &apos;s just gonna walk out on them ?
i need to know where jennifer is .
i kept my end of the bargain --
didn &apos;t say anything about you or elizabeth .
how much does she know ?
very little .
a @-@ are the --
are the two of you , what , working together ?
i don &apos;t even want to know how you pulled that off .
listen to me -- about jennifer , i can protect her .
i &apos;m never going to tell you where my daughter is .
because of you , i &apos;m forced to finally tell frank ,
a man who &apos;s never kept a secret from me --
not only that i was married before ,
but that i was married to --
he sits me down , tells me he &apos;s sorry for me .
try and wrap your warped mind around that .
the man &apos;s entire life is upended .
all he can think about is me .
the arrangements have been made --
passports , identities , a new life .
talk it over with frank .
if you love him ...
you &apos;ll let me help .
where &apos;s naomi hyland ?
in safe hands .
what does that mean -- you &apos;ve already set her up
with a cozy new life in saint kitts or solvang ?
solvang ?
i never send anyone i care about to solvang .
she spent nine days with berlin . we have to debrief her .
she could know something -- his real name , his location .
did you read about that housewife in reston ?
she shot a bank manager .
you &apos;re not hiding her from the fbi .
you &apos;re hiding her from me .
violent crime in d.c. is at a 20 @-@ year low ,
and yet in the last four months ,
there have been seven random acts of violence
by individuals with no prior criminal record .
lizzy , what do you know about social psychology ?
it &apos;s the study of how our behavior
is influenced by the world around us .
not influenced -- manipulated .
in what little time i devote to the judgment
your government has made about my character
and how i treat my fellow man , i can &apos;t help but think about
how many of their own citizens
they &apos;ve treated like lab rats
in the name of science .
i believe this murder in reston
is part of an underground social @-@ psychology experiment .
conducted by our government .
strap on your tinfoil hat , lizzy .
according to reddington ,
three recent incidents prove the u.s. government
is still conducting mind @-@ control experiments .
terry cho , a middle @-@ school teacher
who killed seven of his coworkers during his lunch break .
construction worker henry lee bryce
used a hammer and a box cutter .
killed by police .
the third , maddie thornhill --
single mom who opened fire at a bank in reston .
reddington has alleged that these crimes weren &apos;t random ,
but orestrated by spooks
the government continues to finance
through their black @-@ ops budget .
look , to be honest , i think this is a big distraction
to keep us busy while reddington spirits away his ex .
interview the shooters and their families .
then we &apos;ll worry about the wife .
what would you say if i told you to pull
frank and naomi hyland &apos;s phone records
for the past five years ?
i &apos;d , uh , ask if you had a warrant .
would you ask me to show it to you ?
why would i do that ?
i trust you implicitly , agent keen .
special agents ressler and keen , fbi ,
here to interview madeline thornhill .
i &apos;m sorry -- she &apos;s on a 48 @-@ hour hold .
suicide watch , no visitors .
she &apos;s ... talking to someone right now .
her psychiatrist .
i &apos;ll pass along your contact info , if you &apos;d like .
i really don &apos;t know when things just started to fall apart .
first , it was my job .
maddie was getting a ton of bad reviews on yelp -- by name .
people said she was unhelpful , even rude .
i don &apos;t know why they give so much weight
to those stupid things .
no one seemed dissatisfied in the office ,
but the things they were saying about me ...
i tried to work with her on it ,
but she kept making excuses -- crazy stuff , paranoid .
like what ?
like somebody was out to get her , posting fake reviews .
she was argumentative .
finally , i just had to let her go .
then things fell apart with charlie .
i really had no choice .
i &apos;m in the middle of a custody battle ,
and the court &apos;s got me under a microscope .
it came down to her or my kids .
did you ever see her mistreat them ?
i loved his kids .
i would never hurt any child .
but social services started getting anonymous calls
that when i was over there , they were crying or whatever .
i actually thought about
getting one of those spycams , you know ?
but then i &apos;m thinking ...
if it &apos;s come to that , what &apos;s the point ?
he just dumped me -- after almost two years .
one minute , i &apos;ve got a great job , a boyfriend ,
and the next ...
she started making late payments on her mortgage .
we tried to help , but she was three months behind .
without any income , we had to foreclose .
they just took it ...
like it was just a house .
but it wasn &apos;t just a house .
was it ?
no .
it was me .
maddie thornhill told us her life fell apart
after a series of anonymous accusations .
the shooter i spoke to said the same thing .
in his case , it was accusations of pedophilia .
there were no witnesses , no victims ever came forward ,
but the school didn &apos;t want to take chances , so they fired him .
their problems metastasized like a cancer ,
striking to the heart of these victims &apos; identities .
victims ? these aren &apos;t the victims , keen ,
these are the perps .
the people they killed are the victims .
all i &apos;m saying is that some people
aren &apos;t wired to handle stress ,
and someone took advantage of that .
agent keen had me expedite dna profiles .
all three perpetrators possess the mao @-@ a 2r gene .
the extreme @-@ warrior gene .
clinical studies have proven people who possess this gene
are prone to aggressive , antisocial behavior .
are you suggesting the government has identified
people with mild genetic abnormality
and is turning them into killers ?
that &apos;s exactly what we &apos;re suggesting .
police have not yet commented on how the chase started ,
but sources say the driver shot three clerks this morning
inside of a convenience store ...
phase 2 concluded , period .
ar106 showing signs of deterioration , comma ,
accelerating to ... final break .
vehicle with a weapon .
oh , no .
o @-@ okay , officers have just opened fire . we are going to --
final phase successful , period .
activation of subject ar106 concluded , period .
end of entry .
senator &apos;s office . how may i help you ?
hello , yes . this is dr. linus creel .
i &apos;m calling for senator sheridan .
the perp in the freeway shooting --
i hear he had this warrior gene .
yeah .
agent navabi has identified 11 other cases
in the last 18 months .
no connection other than ...
they share this gene .
and it &apos;s not just some statistical anomaly .
i @-@ it &apos;s as if they &apos;re being triggered .
close the door .
sir ?
you know something ?
every word reddington said about this program is true .
in the army , officers sit in bars ,
and they talk sideways --
&quot; a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy . &quot;
mkultra was just the start .
there were others --
quietly run in military bases and universities
all across the country --
psychopharmaceuticals , electromagnetic pulses ,
microwaves that broadcast words and phrases into the brain .
i love this country , but every once in awhile ,
you hear about something like this ,
some bone @-@ evil crap that &apos;s almost inconceivable .
that &apos;s what i hate most about this detail --
reddington pulling up the carpet
and shoving your nose deep into the filth .
after a while , it &apos;s all you can see .
subproject 7 .
i ... don &apos;t know what that is .
it &apos;s a black @-@ budget program . it &apos;s funded out of the d.i.a.
the goal was to use genetic predispositions
to train and trigger assets .
if it &apos;s black @-@ budget , how am i supposed to gain access ?
i am a dear friend of harold cooper .
he was a pallbearer in my daddy &apos;s funeral .
but i told him when he called
only yahoos are interested in subproject 7 .
so you &apos;re saying it doesn &apos;t exist ?
you &apos;re asking about mind control .
this government can &apos;t make up its own mind ,
let alone control one .
senator , is that a yes or a no ?
it &apos;s a yes and a no .
have we studied mind control ? yes .
does it work ?
about as often as a blind squirrel finds an acorn .
we &apos;ve been tracking a spike in violent crimes ,
mass shootings .
i &apos;m gonna pay you the courtesy of being blunt .
you &apos;re wasting your time .
if there &apos;s been an increase
in the incidence of violent crime ,
you &apos;re not gonna find the answer to why
in the black budget of the u.s. government .
understood .
but i also understand
that you do oversee that black budget ,
and harold cooper would appreciate it
if you could provide us
with any information you have on subproject 7 .
of course .
my office will deliver all pertinent documents .
now , if you will excuse me , i am late for my next meeting .
yes , sir , how can i help you ?
uh , hi . dr. linus creel .
i &apos;m here to see senator sheridan .
honey , we have talked and talked about this .
i thought we were in complete agreement --
we decided not to run .
now , i &apos;ve talked to the fbi --
the fbi can &apos;t protect us .
and he can ?
are you honestly suggesting we upend our lives ?
based on what --
a criminal &apos;s promise that he can help us ?
yes . yes , that is what i &apos;m saying .
and i know how crazy it sounds .
he did this to you .
i &apos;m not defending him , but i do know him .
how do you --
i &apos;m sorry -- i &apos;m still trying to process
the fact that you were married to him .
and now you want to put our lives
in the hands of this lunatic ?
i &apos;m not going anywhere .
this is a mistake .
i can &apos;t help you in philadelphia .
we &apos;ve made up our mind .
you know i would stop at nothing to protect you .
we don &apos;t need your protection .
yes , you do .
i understand it may be difficult for you to accept my help ,
given the history that carla and i share .
don &apos;t flatter yourself .
carla reddington was a miserable housewife
married to a miserable man .
that woman no longer exists .
we &apos;re not going anywhere .
everything the senator sent is redacted -- entire pages .
dollar amounts are omitted .
project names are code .
yeah , &quot; elegant lady , &quot; &quot; forest green . &quot;
i mean , if any of these are subproject 7,
it &apos;d be impossible to tell .
the polyglot .
what ?
in mossad , we have a contact .
he &apos;s like a code breaker .
you give him your black @-@ ops budget ,
the redacted pages , he &apos;ll tell us what they mean .
you have our black @-@ ops budget ?
the polyglot -- how do we find him ?
he was cleared level 4 . i don &apos;t have that kind of access .
oh , my god .
is that what they call him in tel aviv ?
i haven &apos;t spoken to haskell in years .
but you know where to find him ?
i do .
but it &apos;s a sticky situation .
old haskell and i had somewhat of a falling @-@ out
at the craps table .
hask--
i have no interest in seeing you .
go away . you &apos;re not welcome here .
haskell , i told you i &apos;m sorry .
what more can i say ?
you knew i was in recovery .
i didn &apos;t --
okay . yes , i did . but you were having such a great time .
and after everything that happened with sheryl .
and that ... cuban , the boxer --
what was his name ?
i &apos;m not talking to you about this .
yasiel ! god , that hair . beautiful hair .
i thought you could use a little distraction .
you forget -- we won $ 25,000 on one roll .
yes , and i lost twice that much after you left .
i woke up in that ... hotel .
i still don &apos;t know how i got to mesquite .
that kind of money means nothing to you ,
but to me , it &apos;s --
an olive branch , with interest .
my friend miss watkins is a blogger
looking for her first scoop .
i write mostly about social @-@ science experiments .
researching one right now , actually --
the black @-@ ops project subproject 7 .
why don &apos;t we take this into my office ?
it &apos;s v2k @-@ shielded .
here she is -- government white paper on subproject 7 .
i &apos;ve seen the white paper . it &apos;s heavily redacted .
wha-- -
how did you --
haskell &apos;s quite a puzzle man .
spends his days combing through thousands of pages
of redacted government documents ,
comparing them to defense @-@ authorization reports , executive orders .
he &apos;s found a way to read between the lines .
i wouldn &apos;t have the patience .
subproject 7 was born out of the human genome project .
some genius in government figured
that if dna could be used to identify people
who were predisposed to cancer ,
it could be used to identify people
who were predisposed to become assassins .
who are these people ?
the team .
they used the brains of mass murderers
and reverse @-@ engineered from there ,
fine @-@ tuned a three @-@ phase activation process .
first phase --
disruption of schedule , routine , daily life .
second -- destabilize sense of self @-@ worth .
final phase was to sever the primary emotional bond .
get all three -- jackpot .
this man here -- who is he ? i &apos;ve seen his face before .
oh , yes .
he was their lab assistant , dr. linus creel .
dr. linus creel --
phd in clinical psychology from n.y.u.
after subproject 7 disbanded , he opened a private practice .
it appears he supplements his income
working as a locum tenens at six area hospitals .
i cross @-@ referenced creel &apos;s name
with the 11 warrior gene killers in the last 18 months .
at some point , he was on staff at each of the hospitals
where the killers were receiving counseling ,
including our friend maddie thornhill .
that &apos;s how he &apos;s recruiting them .
can we access his network ?
already checked that . i can &apos;t break through his firewall .
if i could somehow gain physical access ,
i could upload a program
to deactivate it long enough to hack his patient list .
come here . take a look at this .
creel has this posted on his website ,
calls it an intake questionnaire .
some kind of i.q. test ?
no , it &apos;s a modified mmpi @-@ 2 --
the minnesota multiphasic personality inventory --
but it &apos;s heavily modified .
he reconfigured the test questions
to flag aggression and low impulse control .
that &apos;s how he finds the subjects with the warrior gene .
what do you mean you won &apos;t tell naomi ? where are you ?
i &apos;m gonna call her . what &apos;s her number ?
no , frank . you said you were leaving your wife .
well , i don &apos;t care if it &apos;s a bad time .
either you tell her about us or i will .
that dog &apos;s been here all day .
you leave your dog inside all day ?
who does that ?
what kind of monster
leaves their dog with no water , no food ? !
who the hell are you ?
he &apos;s done his business inside -- twice !
do you have any idea
the psychological damage that can do to a dog ?
i don &apos;t know how you got in here --
i spent the last 20 minutes cleaning up after him .
where &apos;s his leash ? i &apos;m taking him for a walk .
you are not taking my dog for a walk -- who are y--
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m calling the police right now .
calm yourself down .
we have a few things to talk about .
sit .
she &apos;s exhausted .
why don &apos;t you and i go for a walk ?
this may be hard to understand , frank ,
but after all these years ,
your wife has become more like an estranged sister to me .
we can &apos;t really bear each other &apos;s company .
but i &apos;ve become somewhat concerned
about her general well @-@ being
and sense of security .
are you threatening me ?
she loves you .
you &apos;ve made her happy ...
given her a life , stability ...
the one thing i could never provide .
come closer , frank .
frank . come here .
aram , if i asked you to create an e.m.r. ,
could you feed it into their database ?
you want a fake medical record .
yeah -- family history ,
immunization records , billing addresses .
but most importantly , we &apos;ll need a full psychiatric history .
like what ?
come on .
that &apos;s monica &apos;s dog .
what the hell have you done ?
you &apos;re finished with monica .
where is she ?
we had a few words ,
and , thanks to my friend &apos;s rather judicious rescue ,
we also have a dog .
monica -- what did you do --
she &apos;s fine .
but from this point forward ...
there is only naomi .
she believes you to be an honest man , frank -- faithful --
and that is what you will become .
you &apos;re going to accept my protection
and leave philadelphia .
no .
i &apos;m gonna call the cops , turn you in .
you &apos;re not gonna get away with this .
you make her happy .
that is the only reason you &apos;re still here .
go get it , boy .
city dog .
why would you do that ?
it &apos;s essential for you
to take responsibility for your actions .
i was expelled .
i understand .
and i have given this a lot of thought .
i concluded the reason you told me
you cheated on your final was a cry for help .
i believed telling your school was in your best interest .
but ... i mean , the things we talk about -- they &apos;re secret !
duncan , the only way that you are going to begin to get better
is if you take responsibility for your actions .
you want to move forward in your life , right ?
with your parents ? with amber ?
amber doesn &apos;t want to meet . we &apos;ve only talked online .
but you &apos;re getting healthier .
she &apos;s gonna want to meet soon .
it &apos;s time .
trust me .
i won &apos;t let anything bad happen to you .
dr. creel , on @-@ call nurse in the e.r. just paged you
for a psych consult .
girl &apos;s husband left her ,
put her hand through a window .
attending wants you to take a look .
she &apos;s got a chart a mile long .
hello . you must be angela .
my name is dr. creel .
says here you &apos;ve been having some troubles with your husband .
that &apos;s an understatement .
now , i see that you &apos;ve been treated
for depression and anxiety before .
in college , postgrad .
i had , you know ... a rough patch .
you were hospitalized .
i know this must be difficult for you .
i took some pills . they had to pump my stomach .
was this deliberate or an accident ?
kind of both .
it &apos;s not what you think .
i @-@ it &apos;s not like i ever wanted to commit suicide .
i took them in front of someone .
who ?
i &apos;ll bet you $ 100 she &apos;s telling the truth .
no way .
$ 200 ?
it &apos;s your money .
i had this boyfriend -- ronnie .
i was so young ,
and he ...
was cheating .
i was such an idiot .
feel that you want to hurt yourself now ?
now that your husband has left ?
maybe , yeah .
but you &apos;re angry at him .
i &apos;d kill him .
i @-@ i @-@ i mean , i would never kill him .
that &apos;s not what i meant . it &apos;s just a ...
figure of speech . i understand .
what &apos;s his name ?
tom .
his name was tom .
and if you caught tom cheating , if you walked in on him ,
and you could ...
kill him ?
i &apos;d never .
but if you could do anything and get away with it ,
what would it be ?
no chance of ever getting caught ?
you &apos;re above the law . have at him .
i &apos;d ... chain him up .
yeah ?
and i &apos;d ... force him to tell me
about all of the lies ,
the secrets he kept .
i &apos;d make him my prisoner .
it &apos;s pretty messed up , huh ?
you know ...
we don &apos;t put people in prison for how they feel .
you can &apos;t control it .
you are who you are .
it &apos;s biology .
we never argue about height or eye color .
but try telling someone
their reaction to anger
or love or violence
is baked in .
now ...
it says here that your parents died when you were 4 .
what do you remember about them ?
nothing , really .
perhaps if you did ,
it would be easier for you to accept who you are .
like the ... sins of the father . that it ?
absolutely .
the more time you spend with your parents ,
the more of yourself you see in them .
for better or for worse ,
they &apos;re a glimpse into your future .
oh , he must belong to someone .
maybe we can see if he has a chip or something ,
see who his owners are .
if he doesn &apos;t have any ,
we could bring him back to philadelphia .
we can &apos;t go back .
what ? we -- we already decided .
no , uh ...
if there &apos;s any chance you &apos;re in danger ,
i couldn &apos;t live with myself .
if something were to happen to you .
you did this . you threatened him .
you threatened his girls .
no , this had nothing to do with him .
this is about us --
what &apos;s best for us , for you .
that &apos;s all that matters .
my father died in a fire . i was 4 .
is that how you got the scar on your hand ?
yeah .
i guess . i don &apos;t ... remember , actually .
early trauma scars us in ways
we don &apos;t often recognize or admit .
you think i don &apos;t want to remember ?
look , angela , i am here to determine
whether you are a danger to yourself or others .
i know that you don &apos;t want to spend the night here .
so , i am going to see
if i can expedite the blood tests .
meanwhile , i would like you to take a simple personality test
i developed for my patients .
it &apos;s a standardized psychometric test
that &apos;s gonna give me a deeper understanding
into issues you may or may not have .
when the nurse drew my blood ,
she said that you ordered a genetic screening .
too many of my colleagues
focus on the nurture side of the equation .
and sure -- how your parents treated you is important ,
but the genes they passed on matter more .
there are no wrong answers .
just ... whatever comes to mind .
okay , got it . go .
hold down power , shift , &quot; s. &quot;
okay . i see white letters on a black screen .
perfect . okay . type forward slash b @-@ n.
it &apos;s running a dictionary attack .
should take a few seconds .
got it .
okay , it &apos;s gonna give you a password .
i need you to write it down .
a few more characters .
the blood panels won &apos;t be done for another 20 minutes .
okay .
did you really think you could just ...
... come in here ...
... lie to me ?
that &apos;s no good .
i know why you &apos;re here .
i told you -- i @-@ i need your help .
you ...
are a junkie .
you &apos;re trying to forge scripts .
maybe my father was an addict , too --
hand them over !
now !
let &apos;s go .
they &apos;re under here somewhere .
okay , got them .
are you gonna call the cops or something ?
no .
now i &apos;m only more interested in your test results .
please continue .
oh , my god .
you okay ?
you didn &apos;t get the password .
i mean , what do you expect ?
&apos;course i got it .
magic .
安博 : 真抱歉 我不是故意要伤害你的
邓肯 : 你和保罗在一起吗
okay , there has got to be 70 ...
100 files here from creel &apos;s laptop .
he was documenting them ,
searching for the perfect candidates .
hold on . wait .
i have got a hidden subdirectory here --
12 patients .
the killers .
everyone in this file has murdered someone .
except one -- duncan prince .
he must be next .
where do we find him ? ?
i got an address in college park .
what ? what the hell ?
duncan prince -- where is he ? !
okay , folks ,
the community forum will be starting in 15 minutes .
everyone who would like to make a comment
will have an opportunity to do so .
microphones are at either end of the aisles .
why don &apos;t we go ahead and start forming two lines ?
we &apos;ve looked at every conceivable database .
there &apos;s nothing on an amber deveraux .
well , i don &apos;t know who the hell he &apos;s been talking to ,
but this amber deveraux just crushed the kid an hour ago .
ressler .
listen to me -- this kid &apos;s gacked up and gone .
the stoner roommates have no idea where .
the girl &apos;s in trouble . you got to find her .
amber deveraux doesn &apos;t exist .
that &apos;s how he &apos;s triggering his clients --
anonymous allegations that can never be verified .
poor reviews online , blind accusations at work .
and by girlfriends who don &apos;t exist .
you think he &apos;s catfishing ,
that he invented the girl to trigger duncan prince ,
push him over the edge ?
yeah .
find out where he thinks she is .
many of the random acts of violence
we &apos;re here to discuss today
are perpetrated by people with the warrior gene .
i believe the solution
to the issue of violent crime in this country
begins with genetic screening .
dr. creel , we have a packed schedule today ,
so if you have a question ?
people with the warrior gene can be triggered .
i have identified what those triggers are ,
and when they occur , it &apos;s not their fault .
my research shows -- - a question , please .
hold on .
prince &apos;s fake girlfriend posted a very real photo
from a community forum on gun violence .
duncan must have seen this .
senator sheridan .
that &apos;s where our shooter &apos;s going .
我去参加反枪支论坛了 谢丽丹参议员也去哦 太棒了
heading to the gun rally .
creel posted the photo .
he &apos;s gonna be there ... observing his experiment .
senator , it is all right here --
seven years of research .
these killings can be prevented .
i want the world to know that what happens today ,
what i do ,
is because of amber ...
because she lied to me ...
because she &apos;s a cheat .
goodbye , amber .
in my system , it will require children to be screened
for the mao @-@ a 2r gene .
kids will be labeled . we &apos;ll target them .
it will cost --
i promise you , dr. creel , your research will be reviewed .
reviewed . studied .
you don &apos;t return my calls .
you refuse to see me when i come up to your office .
and when one of these incidents happens ,
you ... do ... nothing !
i have been the leading voice in congress on mental health
for 20 years .
how many more of these mass killings do we have now
than we did then ?
i &apos;m telling you -- we have the science .
i can stop these killings , and you want to reject me ?
you want to reject the science ?
get out of here !
where is she ? !
she &apos;s not here , duncan . amber &apos;s not here .
what are you --
i &apos;m the one you &apos;re looking for .
amber -- she led me on .
amber didn &apos;t do anything , because she doesn &apos;t exist .
i created her .
you &apos;re here to kill me , duncan .
what the hell are you talking about ?
&quot; i didn &apos;t mean to hurt you . &quot; &quot; whatever . &quot;
&quot; here to talk . &quot;
&quot; with paul ? &quot;
&quot; he &apos;s a great guy , really . &quot;
&quot; i.d.g.a.s. &quot;
why do you think you never met her ?
because she &apos;s not real !
the picture she posted , the one that brought you here --
i posted it .
that &apos;s right .
pull the trigger .
duncan , no ! listen to me .
you .
put the gun down . you don &apos;t want to do this .
he lied to you , manipulated you .
it &apos;s not your fault .
pull the trigger , duncan . it &apos;s what you came to do .
you &apos;re all part of my experiment .
read my research ! we can save them !
duncan , listen to me .
he &apos;s making you believe that you don &apos;t have a choice !
do you think that i want to die ? i don &apos;t .
but i have run out of ways to get people to pay attention .
do this , and the world will listen .
they &apos;ll examine my life , my research .
that can &apos;t happen unless you pull the trigger .
medic ! i need a medic !
take it easy , pal .
creel , listen to me . you have to understand .
if i have a shot , i &apos;m gonna take it .
put your weapon down !
i shoot her , you shoot me !
that &apos;s how this works , right ?
make you a martyr ? not today .
you should know -- i saw your test results .
you know what they said ?
where did it come from ?
where the hell did that shot come from ? !
there -- on the roof . go !
i received everything creel had on file at the hospital .
patient records , test results ...
including yours .
we logged everything else into evidence ,
but i thought perhaps you would want that .
it &apos;s probably meaningless , right ?
do you think reddington could have known ,
when he gave you this case , that you &apos;d find out ?
what do i know ?
you were right about keen .
she was making it all up .
i knew it .
walt &apos;s favorite shrimp is calling my name .
winner buys ?
see you tomorrow .
i followed up on frank and naomi hyland , like you asked .
both phones are dead .
so i identified the five numbers they called the most
to see if any of those people
were getting calls from new numbers .
people that frank and naomi might have reached out to .
and ... ?
there &apos;s a woman -- monica lyons .
she got six calls today , all unanswered .
all came from a pay phone
at a gas station in rural maryland .
only a handful of homes in that area .
what gas station ?
hello , mrs. hyland .
does raymond know you &apos;re here ?
no .
he doesn &apos;t want us to talk .
♬ along the quiet ... ♬
i &apos;m sorry . i just --
i have a ton of questions in this notebook about the case ,
but the truth is , i didn &apos;t come here
just to ask you about berlin .
you have questions you think i can answer about the past .
yes .
♬ whatever needs to be will be ♬
the day raymond reddington walked into my life ,
everything changed --
everything i believed about .
you were married to the man .
you had a life , a child .
jennifer .
yeah . w @-@ why doesn &apos;t he want me to see you ?
you tell me .
i think it might be because you know something
about how the two of us might be connected .
he wants something from you .
it &apos;s a game . it &apos;s a manipulation .
he &apos;s made you feel a connection
that makes you feel like you matter somehow .
and there &apos;s no one on earth
who can make a woman feel like the center of his universe
more than raymond reddington .
i &apos;ll tell you this , though .
he &apos;s not who you think he is .
what does he want from me ?
well . look at the two of you .
i should have brought a bottle of chardonnay .
i have your papers . dembe &apos;s outside .
he &apos;ll need your signature on some of the documents .
frank is gonna pack the car .
♬ time to meet them all again ♬
♬ for once at eye level ♬
agent keen .
i hope you had an illuminating conversation .
♬ along the quiet , narrow streets ♬
♬ canals are still in high tide ♬
♬ whatever needs to be will be ♬
i don &apos;t know where jennifer is .
she knew you ... would come for her one day ,
and she left .
i don &apos;t know where she is .
♬ a crater left as a divide ♬
if you need anything ...
ever ...
♬ there will soon be time to meet them all again ♬
♬ for once at eye level ♬
when are you gonna tell her ?
♬ and for once as friends ♬
♬ there will be time ♬
so , how &apos;d your case go ?
i think you know the answer to that .
who is he ?
who is who ?
the gunman , the sniper .
he works for you , doesn &apos;t he ?
yes .
how long has he been following me ?
since the day agent malik died .
i want him gone .
my associate saves your life ,
and instead of saying &quot; thank you , &quot;
you try to get him fired .
if i knew better , i &apos;d say you were hiding something .
