gentlemen , three months ago ,
i bravely re @-@ entered the dating pool .
and how has this city rewarded me ?
with an endless parade of weirdo ass clowns .
hard to say who was the worst .
comedy magician .
no , it &apos;s the guy with the little ding @-@ ding .
the lion tamer .
never went out with a lion tamer .
then i am having some vivid dreams .
the point is ,
ian has asked me out on a third date .
ooh . and this is the biggest compliment i could give :
i want to go .
because i like him .
that &apos;s not a reason .
and , frankly , it &apos;s been a while .
and the third date is where
* mama gets her biscuit . *
mama gets her biscuit .
i don &apos;t understand .
it &apos;s sex .
oh !
yeah !
now , that &apos;s a reason !
anyway , i &apos;m bringing him home tonight ,
so let &apos;s keep those toilets flushed .
that means stick around . take a second look .
how &apos;d you tell ian about the
fun surprise that you still live with your ex ?
all right .
well , i haven &apos;t told him yet .
uh , tricky conversation .
i &apos;m thinking of something simple like ,
&quot; hey , ian , i live with my ex . &quot;
no . no , no . when a guy hears that , he is going to
run through the wall like the kool @-@ aid man .
here &apos;s a fun idea .
you can put a hat on him with antlers .
this way , the hole he makes in the wall will make us all smile .
nick brings home girls all the time .
there &apos;s no problem .
no complaints here .
it &apos;ll make you forget every botanical garden
you &apos;ve ever seen .
i live with my ex @-@ girlfriend .
and after the farmer &apos;s market ...
i live with my ex .
let &apos;s have sex again .
i live with my ex .
damn it . too quick .
hey , if you &apos;re looking to scare somebody off ,
it &apos;s basically a gold mine .
nobody cares that we &apos;re exes who live together .
i got to go .
okay , that doesn &apos;t prove anything .
just for the record , i &apos;m leaving &apos; cause you live with your ex .
it &apos;s gross . and disgusting .
and i &apos;m gonna steal some stuff .
take what you want , honey .
we don &apos;t read those anymore .
nick , who are these girls ?
they &apos;re not the best .
jess , guys hate complicated situations .
we want the path of least resistance .
there &apos;s a flap in our underwear because we are too lazy
to pull our underpants down .
no offense , nick , but ...
ian &apos;s a little different from you or the women you bring home .
the ... tavern folk .
have some respect . they &apos;re called uh @-@ ohs .
and i &apos;ve been through a lot of names : pork pals
okay .
bone cronies ,
right .
c @-@ plussy hussies .
very reverent .
but &quot; uh @-@ oh &quot; takes it off of them
and back onto me where it belongs .
i made the mistake , not them . they &apos;re great .
you really are a prince among men , nick .
aw , that &apos;s awfully nice . i feel like i &apos;m maturing .
all i &apos;m saying is that , somehow ,
ian is even more mature than you are .
and that &apos;s why i think he &apos;ll understand
when i tell him in a mature adult way , i live with my ex ,
but there &apos;s nothing to worry about .
can i suggest a tweak ?
fine .
&quot; i live with my ex , but there &apos;s nothing to worry about
because he &apos;s gay now . &quot;
no .
&quot; because he has weeks to live . &quot;
no .
&quot; because he &apos;s already dead . &quot;
what ?
then i &apos;ll act like a ghost .
no .
consider it .
no .
come on .
that &apos;s the worst ghost impression i &apos;ve ever heard .
this is the worst ghost impression you &apos;ve ever heard ?
i &apos;m a ghost .
there &apos;s way worse .
anything for me ?
oh , no , this isn &apos;t our mail . this is our neighbors &apos; mail .
you see , viv likes it alphabetized .
yet michelle likes it according to size .
hashtag &quot; go figure , &quot; right ?
hashtag &quot; did you see how i rhymed ? &quot;
i want to choke you until your eyes
literally pop out of your head .
those girls are not going to sleep with you .
they are hot . and nothing is less hot than a male secretary .
what ?
i think somebody needs to take a good long look
at defense secretary chuck hagel .
dude &apos;s eyes are so pouchy ,
he can barely see anything , and he &apos;s still killing it .
girls don &apos;t have sex with guys who sort their mail .
look , i am playing the long game here , coach ,
weaving myself into the fabric of their lives .
pretty soon i &apos;ll be as permanent
as the will that i helped them draw up .
oh , winston , thank god you &apos;re here .
the toilet won &apos;t flush .
did you jiggle the handle ?
no , it &apos;s not working for us .
here .
i &apos;m not here to do any chores .
you guys want to hang out tonight ?
sure .
sure .
right on . right on . that &apos;s what &apos;s up .
coach , i really need my stilts and a plunger !
eh , i don &apos;t care .
i &apos;m happy to lend you a bra ,
but i don &apos;t think i have anything that would fit you .
that &apos;s the peter pan .
that &apos;ll smash &apos; em down good ,
but you &apos;ll never get those in there .
i know . i just wanted to see
what it would feel like to be your size .
are we doing , like , a boob freaky friday ?
主人公为两母女
because i don &apos;t want to lug yours around . they &apos;re a load .
i know . that &apos;s the whole point . that &apos;s why all the women
in my family have back trouble , you know ?
so , now that i have insurance , though ,
i was thinking maybe i could have , like ,
breast reduction surgery .
no !
i wonder who this is .
what ?
it &apos;s a boob reduction , schmidt .
just accept it .
acceptance is stage five .
i &apos;m grieving , cece . there are five stages of grief .
stage one was denial .
this is not happening ,
this is not happening .
yes , it is . yes , it is .
you &apos;re not getting a boob reduction .
yes , i am .
this is not happening .
yes , it is .
stage two was anger .
your breasts belong to all of us !
okay .
who are you to decide ? !
next will be stage four , depression .
and then stage five , acceptance .
but right now , i &apos;m firmly planted in stage three ,
bargaining .
dear god , if you stop cece &apos;s breast reduction ,
okay .
i &apos;ll circumcise coach .
whoa , coach .
go out with them tonight ? doesn &apos;t make any sense , man .
and compromise the long game ? ha .
not until i replace their rocker switches with dimmers .
forget your long game , winston ! getting a girl
to have sex with you is not about planning ahead .
it is about seizing opportunities
that you never saw coming . it is instinct .
all right ? it is improv .
it is jazz , man .
but with words . you dig ? and the words are ,
&quot; oh , yeah , girl , i &apos;m about to ... &quot;
glen , my man , tell me something good .
and you better not be trying to sell me
some non @-@ dimmable halogens , you son of a ...
where you at ?
are you kidding me ?
hey , buddy .
you know what you need to surround yourself with tonight ?
four new boobs .
on two different women ?
you &apos;re damn right .
take me to them .
um , do you want to , like , go find a bar , grab a drink ?
there &apos;s a bar that i like .
it &apos;s called ... my place .
great . uh , is it ... you think it &apos;ll be crowded ?
you know i &apos;m talking about my house , right ?
okay . yeah , no , i wasn &apos;t ... i thought that was just
a clever name , but now i do .
no .
and , yeah , let &apos;s go there .
um , one thing i want to ,
uh , disclose to you in a very mature
adult way , i ... live with my ex .
okay . uh , yeah , you live with your ex .
yeah .
but also three other guys .
it &apos;s more zany than sexy .
okay . so it , like , wasn &apos;t really serious ?
oh , it was very serious .
did you say &quot; i love you &quot; ?
not until he said it .
uh , yeah , i don &apos;t think i can do this .
i &apos;m sorry . i just ...
what ?
i &apos;ve been on so many weird dates lately .
i &apos;m just looking
no . ian .
for something easier . i ...
no , ian , ian , ian ,
ian , ian , look .
yes , i live with my ex .
but there &apos;s nothing to worry about .
because ...
nick . you &apos;re gay .
huh ?
you &apos;re gay .
be gay . be gay . be gay .
be gay ?
i just had to make sure these animals flushed .
oh . not you , you fastidious queen .
oh , y @-@ you must be nick .
well , friends call me gay nick .
my perfect sunday-- sitting here , watching the game ,
eating a pot pie with a hot dude
with no shirt on , on my lap kissing me .
right on , man .
right on , man .
all right .
you got it .
uh , can i use your restroom ?
yeah . it &apos;s down the hall to the right .
don &apos;t worry . i won &apos;t peek .
but he wants to .
oh , my god , i am so sorry .
i should just tell him the truth .
it &apos;s too late for the truth , jess .
you live with a gay man ,
and this gay man &apos;s gonna help you get laid .
okay . thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
do you think you can play a gay man ?
i &apos;m terrible at lying , i &apos;m terrific at make @-@ believe .
okay .
okay ? but i need to know some backstory
&apos;cause it &apos;s very important to me .
okay . yeah , backstory &apos;s important .
okay .
tell me , have i always known i was gay ,
or did i just recently realize it ?
that &apos;s-- um , you @-@ you always knew you were gay ,
but you grew up in an oil town
where masculinity was the most valued currency .
um , you @-@ you had an older brother named chip .
and chip was a union guy .
yes .
and if it wasn &apos;t about teamster local 11,
chip didn &apos;t want to hear about it .
oh , my god , we &apos;re doing this .
when i came out , was it flashy ?
was it emotional ?
am i mad that anderson cooper doesn &apos;t fly the flag ?
or for what he &apos;s doing in his own way-- is it even braver ?
these are all really good questions , but i just can &apos;t
get my mind off , like , why you dress this way .
why aren &apos;t you in better shape ?
don &apos;t put me in a box !
there &apos;s nothing we gay men hate more than being put in a box .
good . look , maybe i &apos;m a bear , maybe i &apos;m a twinkler .
that &apos;s not a category .
i like rugby
for the game and for the men .
now , if you excuse me , i got to go do
that gay thing i was telling you about ,
because , of course , i &apos;m gay as hell .
bye .
that &apos;s not how gay men talk .
i am shattering stereotypes .
what are you doing here , man ?
i &apos;m always here .
very definition of the long game .
forget your long game . it doesn &apos;t ...
what is he ... ?
what are you doing , man ?
is this ... ?
is this the fut ... the future ?
i can hold them both in one hand .
yeah , man .
no , no , there it is . look at that .
stage four-- depression .
my two best friends are going away .
going away far too soon .
and if you were lucky enough to meet them ,
to touch them , to be touched by them ,
you came away a better person .
if you &apos;ll excuse me .
is he ... is he talking about you guys ?
yes . yes , he is , uh ... he &apos;s talking about us .
we are , unfortunately , we &apos;re going away ... tomorrow .
so , uh , we &apos;d better make tonight count , huh , ladies ?
wait .
we barely got to know you !
how long will you be gone ?
for ... for ...
44 weeks .
44 weeks ?
tell them about our business , man .
you don &apos;t have to be shy about it .
uh , right .
no . yeah .
hello . do you like socks ?
we sell socks .
everybody likes socks .
i just cried on my penis while i was peeing .
that happened .
i just can &apos;t stop thinking about them .
you know , there are some people that are gonna say that they ...
they look alike .
that they &apos;re exactly the same . and you know what ?
they just don &apos;t know them like i know them .
truth @-@ truth be told ?
one of them ...
one of them is slightly more brown than the other .
and they &apos;re so unique ,
and they &apos;re so special .
you know what i &apos;m gonna miss most about them ?
watching them bounce .
watching them ...
watching them bounce .
if you just give me a chance to exp ...
well , easy come , easy go .
easy ? easy ? !
you just stole six months of my life , man .
i am ... i am p.o.d , hombre !
winston !
can i get a high five ?
bam .
sorry i called you a biscuit .
i &apos;m sorry i liked it so much .
hey , jess , you in there ?
is that nick ?
do you mean gay nick ?
yeah , that &apos;s gay nick .
i am so sorry .
what &apos;s going on ?
i screwed up .
a girl , nick ?
i know .
nick , really ?
you look like my dead friend karen .
does anyone ever tell you that ?
hmm , no . thank you .
what ? !
i wanted to be gay for you , i really did ,
but it &apos;s a very hard time to be gay .
girls are wearing scarves and boots .
they have so many layers to them .
what is underneath all those layers ? i want to find out !
are you blaming autumn ?
look , it was one night . get rid of her !
i tried . i told her i live with my ex ,
and she didn &apos;t care .
you look so cute in the morning .
you talking to me or her ?
okay . i &apos;ll get rid of her .
i &apos;ll just pretend to be your crazy ex @-@ girlfriend .
i can do this .
i did a one @-@ woman production of a christmas carol .
you , sir , what day is it ?
aye , it &apos;s christmas day .
that was not good .
it was perfect .
thank you . i thought you &apos;d think that .
yeah , it &apos;s perfect .
all right , look ,
you stay here and keep your gay warm , okay ?
in case ian comes back . also , can we agree
that this is not the most mature way to handle things ?
even though it &apos;s pretty fun .
it &apos;s no fun a couple bellinis
and a round of apples to apples can &apos;t solve .
what kind of gay are you ?
i &apos;m still finding it .
all right .
all right .
nick thinks we &apos;re broken up , but he also thinks
that the last girl he slept with wasn &apos;t me in a wig .
wigs are so good for tricking guys .
i &apos;m around all the time .
do you really want to get yourself in this situation ?
my last boyfriend was , like , honestly in his 80s .
i was just like , &quot; don &apos;t die , myron . &quot;
does that answer your question ?
tell me everything you did sexually !
everything ! all of it , or leave !
i put my finger ...
stop !
but you asked ...
no .
i @-@ i did , but it backfired .
ah , so it is load bearing , huh ?
what are you doing ?
me ? oh , well , first , i &apos;m putting up the shelves .
then i got to finish the floor ,
so that the shelves can appear level , then the ceiling .
enough ! all right ? you &apos;ve done enough for these women .
look , ladies , i tried to manipulate you ,
and i am sorry about that , but
you guys have been manipulating my friend for months .
it is not okay . just dangling sex like a little carrot .
we are not using sex to get winston to do stuff .
no .
wait . you &apos;re not ?
no .
well , then he &apos;s done doing stuff .
come on , winston . you &apos;re better than this .
forget you guys .
wait !
yeah , just @-@ just give us a minute .
okay , we have to talk about ...
what are they whispering about ?
i don &apos;t know .
we could just stack the books .
no ... no .
oh , man , this is embarrassing .
okay . it &apos;s me .
come on .
what ?
wait . listen . um ...
michelle , you don &apos;t have to do this .
that &apos;s okay . i kind of want to .
just , uh , keep the pencil behind your ear ,
and bring the hard hat , um , and the safety goggles .
long game .
wonder what &apos;s taking , uh , jess so long .
well , you know women .
what &apos;s women ?
am i right ?
&quot; what &apos;s women ? &quot;
i just don &apos;t know them like you know them , is my point .
uh , so , what kind of guys do you like to date ?
me ? all kinds .
hunks . if i can get my , uh , paws on a hunk , i don &apos;t let go .
uh , ripped nerds .
&apos;cause they &apos;re smart but strong , i guess .
uh @-@ huh . i like spanish guys .
throw in a little , uh , hint of german in there ,
there &apos;s a perfect combo .
okay .
certain ice cream men , i guess .
carpet steamers . sleepy guys .
uh , we in the gay community call them &quot; drowsers . &quot;
why would you like a sleepy guy ?
look ... i &apos;m so out of the game--
i &apos;m in a relationship .
he &apos;s got a nice penis .
you &apos;re sweating a lot .
that &apos;s what he said ! am i right ?
i &apos;m a sweaty lover , is what he says to me .
okay , you know , you really don &apos;t seem gay .
i don &apos;t buy it .
hey .
not now .
probably wondering why i didn &apos;t come home last night .
just needed some space to process this whole thing .
i &apos;m sorry if our room felt empty .
well , it did .
i was really worried about you .
so where were you ? you owe me that much .
i just went walking on the streets last night .
i needed to come to terms with all this .
ended up in a park . i know that &apos;s stupid ,
but i promise i was careful .
i mean , i was totally safe .
a park ?
i don &apos;t know , man .
i &apos;m upset ... but i understand .
it &apos;s okay .
come here .
come here .
there , there .
thanks .
yeah .
acceptance .
give me a kiss .
just give me a kiss .
all right ?
i felt like you needed that more than i did .
your scruff , by the way , is perfect .
don &apos;t touch your beard trimming setting .
okay .
take it easy .
okay .
that was beautiful .
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m sorry , you know ?
i think i &apos;m just more used to , like ,
stereotypical gay guys , like him , you know ?
you offended me .
i &apos;m sorry .
ian ! ian !
ian , hi . there are some events that are about to occur
that i &apos;d like to get ahead of .
um , the truth is that nick is ...
oh , god .
get off of me !
you &apos;re not a man !
ian ! wait . i &apos;m so sorry i lied ,
and you don &apos;t owe me anything , but could i just
ask you one thing before you leave ?
what is this , an exit interview ?
is there any good way
i could have told you about my living situation ?
okay , you know what ? fair question . um ... no !
look , nick was just trying to help me .
clearly ,
he would do anything for you . i mean , he went so far
as to hire an actual gay man to play his cheating lover .
what ? oh , my god . you know what ?
i think that was schmidt .
he &apos;s ... not gay .
when are the lies gonna stop ? !
now , this is just a consultation ,
so do your best to relax .
okay .
stop the surgery !
this is just a consultation .
may we have the room , please ?
that &apos;s what it &apos;s here for .
i &apos;m sorry .
what are you doing ? !
okay , look , i know
i can &apos;t stop this , and i accept that ,
but i just wanted to stop it long enough
so that i could say good @-@ bye .
aw . look , this is a low @-@ risk procedure , okay ?
i &apos;m gonna be fine .
oh , you meant say good @-@ bye to my boobs .
i forgot who i was talking to .
no , schmidt , you cannot see my boobs .
i need to look them in the eyes . i can &apos;t let them leave
without knowing how much they &apos;ve meant to me .
i &apos;ll let them know .
no .
i need to tell them myself .
all right ...
you can say good @-@ bye to one , all right ?
i mean , j @-@ just one ?
one .
gosh almighty .
the ultimate sophie &apos;s cho @-@ cho .
i mean , there &apos;s harold , who &apos;s just ...
full of life ...
and kumar , who &apos;s shy .
who &apos;s shy , but yet surprisingly so brave .
but , you know , who wouldn &apos;t be with a best friend like harold ?
oh , my god , fine !
you can say good @-@ bye to both , okay ?
okay . i need you to put these on .
what ?
this is a private conversation that doesn &apos;t concern you .
the playlist ...
matches the mood .
i mean , i guess if i &apos;m being honest ,
it doesn &apos;t matter what size you are .
i &apos;m always gonna love you ,
because you &apos;re attached to the most beautiful person
in the whole world .
you know what i think ? i think
that when people go on dates with us ,
probably talk to their friends
and their friends say ,
&quot; you go on dates with a lot of weirdos . &quot;
oh , my god .
we &apos;re the weirdo ass clowns .
aw , no . everyone in their 30s waits in line for the shower .
i &apos;m sorry , but the truth is , as long as you live with me ,
you &apos;re not gonna meet a normal guy .
why are you guys all in here ?
winston &apos;s taking a long @-@ ass shower .
poor guy gets dirty .
all right , let me see the new .
i accept it .
again , it was just a consultation .
and actually , i don &apos;t even know if i &apos;m gonna go through with it .
you &apos;re still here . i saved you .
i &apos;m your schindler .
one day , your children
are gonna put rocks on my grave .
hey , uh , wow . you guys mind if i get cuts ?
&apos;cause i am very dirty .
wait a minute .
who &apos;s in the sh ...
hey , what &apos;s the vibe here
on shower pee @-@ pee ?
i &apos;m just trying to plan my day .
who is this woman ? !
you have awesome water pressure .
you should see what &apos;s falling out of my hair .
well , nick ...
looks like you &apos;re gonna have to marry her .
it &apos;s looking that way , isn &apos;t it ?
yeah .
she &apos;s not so bad .
she &apos;s peeing in the shower .
yeah , she is .
that &apos;s weird .
classic tina .
