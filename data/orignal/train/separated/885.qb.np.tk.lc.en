back in the &apos; 80s , being a man &apos;s man was simple .
all you needed was muscles or a mustache .
unfortunately , i was miles from dolph lundgren
and no chuck norris ...
yet .
get scared , boys .
goldberg &apos;s coming for you .
i was what you &apos;d call a &quot; late bloomer , &quot;
like the latest ... ever .
what &apos;s up , goldnerd ? how was your winter break ?
j.c. spink ? what the -- what happened to you ?
grew a ton . i stink . got acne all over my back .
it &apos;s awesome .
but worst of all , the girls were growing even faster ,
especially my girlfriend , dana caldwell .
yo , girls . mainly you .
um , hi ?
there &apos;s a party at the water tower .
usually there &apos;s no freshman allowed .
but for you , i &apos;ll make an exception .
actually , i &apos;m not a freshmen .
adam f. goldberg . pleasure .
uh , what &apos;s this about a party ?
uh , i &apos;ll see you there , dana .
and , uh , don &apos;t bring your little brother .
i &apos;m actually four months and 16 days older than her ,
and we &apos;re together .
weird . anthony balsamo knows my name .
and he &apos;s such a mensch to invite both of us .
wait -- you want to go to that ?
it &apos;s just gonna be a bunch of rowdy high @-@ school guys
spray @-@ painting dirty words on the water tower .
big , bad adam ain &apos;t afraid of no water tower .
or ghosts , fyi .
i desperately wanted my girlfriend , dana ,
to see me as a man .
are you standing on your tiptoes ?
don &apos;t think so .
and if it wasn &apos;t gonna happen on its own ,
i would kick @-@ start the process myself .
the hell are you doing ?
i &apos;m stimulating the follicles . i read it in gq .
it &apos;s a magazine for stylish men of means .
okay , everybody out .
i need to use the -- oh , my god .
are you using my lady bic ?
i &apos;m stimulating the follicles !
ha , you suck ! barry , get the camera !
adam &apos;s being adam !
what &apos;s with all the yelling ?
oh , my joy ! is my baby trying to shave ? !
i &apos;m stimulating the follicles .
oh ! i got the polaroid !
say &quot; peach fuzz . &quot;
it was january 7 , 1980 @-@ something ,
and my brother , barry , had his first real @-@ live girlfriend ,
lainey lewis .
you went through my backpack and ate my pudding ?
who does that ?
aw , so cute when my boyfriend flies into a rage over pudding .
whoa , whoa , whoa . hold up .
you just said &quot; boyfriend &quot; out loud ,
in front of other teenage human people .
dude , it &apos;s not a big deal .
it &apos;s just -- i &apos;ve never been this happy .
aw . don &apos;t celebrate just yet .
my dad has to meet your dad first .
it &apos;s like his only rule .
he needs to know you come from good stock .
i don &apos;t .
you &apos;ve seen my stock . it &apos;s like terrible stock .
i have a plan .
we &apos;ll have you guys come to a football game
so they &apos;ll be distracted and drinking a lot .
that &apos;s genius !
think you can get him to come over ?
hey , big tasty knows how to handle murray goldberg .
there &apos;s a 100 % chance my dad will be there .
there &apos;s a 0 % chance i will be there .
please . it &apos;s just one little football game .
little ? ! we &apos;re talking cowboys @-@ eagles here !
it &apos;s the biggest game of the year .
it &apos;s the only thing i care about in the entire world .
more than your child ?
yes .
you put me in a position where i had to say it .
and now that i did , i feel free .
if i hear you say &quot; no &quot; again , i &apos;m hulking out .
we &apos;re talking screaming and swearing .
i &apos;m gonna smash this decorative box !
do not hulk out ! do not smash that decorative box !
say goodbye to the decorative box !
your mom keeps her knickknacks in there .
i &apos;ll destroy her knickknacks , too !
hulk doesn &apos;t respect knickknacks !
fine ! i &apos;ll do your stupid thing !
where are we going again ?
do you even listen when i talk ?
i get the gist of it , say &quot; no &quot; a lot .
i make it work .
i &apos;m cool with that .
while barry was hulking out for lainey ,
i was bulking up for dana .
&quot; buns of steel &quot; ?
&quot; just five minutes a day for the working mom on the go . &quot;
that can vaguely apply to me .
okay , what &apos;s going on with you ?
all the guys at school are turning into grown men ,
and i still have a little @-@ boy body .
ah , puberty . i was an early bloomer myself .
those were the days .
that &apos;s not helpful , is it ?
no ! my girlfriend &apos;s is about to be stolen by anthony balsamo .
i don &apos;t know who this balsamic character is ,
but i &apos;m sure you don &apos;t need to worry .
no , he should worry . panic even .
i mean , anthony balsamo &apos;s a 10 .
mom says i &apos;m a 10 .
she also says barry can be a doctor .
oh , god , pops ! help me !
it &apos;s a lie . i &apos;m not a 10 .
if anthony balsamo &apos;s got his eye on your girl ,
you got to think big .
in this case , maybe a diamond or a car
or an exotic trip around the world .
adam , you can &apos;t buy a girlfriend .
unless she &apos;s out of your league .
then you &apos;ve got to pull out all the stops .
okay , then . jewelry it is .
i could give her my sweet green lantern ring .
or you keep looking .
no , it &apos;s perfect .
just sleep on it .
why ? it glows and everything .
it &apos;s for nerds , okay ? nerds .
i &apos;m sorry . but you left me no choice .
they were right .
they only way to lock down dana
was with a big , sparkly ring .
lucky for me , my nana left me the perfect one .
my mom said , one day ,
i &apos;d give it to the woman of my dreams .
surely , she was thinking middle school , right ?
you like ?
adam , it &apos;s too much .
nothing &apos;s too much for my number @-@ one special lady friend .
it &apos;s beautiful .
be sure to wear it tonight to the water tower .
you still want go to that party ?
that balsamo kid was nice enough to invite us .
the least we could do is pop in and show your ring off .
adam frederick goldberg !
put it away . oh , god . hide your ring .
oh , god . she knows .
how does she know ? how do you know ?
i have an itemized inventory right here
of everything that goes in and out of our house .
now give me nana &apos;s ring .
no , you said , one day ,
i could give it to the woman of my choosing ,
and i choose dana .
by woman of your choosing , i meant of our choosing .
i &apos;m a man , i made this decision ,
and now there &apos;s nothing that you can do about it .
oh , yes , there is .
hi , mrs. goldberg .
dana , lovely to see you . i &apos;m gonna need that ring back .
mom , do not do this .
ring .
do not .
ring , ring , ring .
do not .
ring , ring . who &apos;s there ? it &apos;s me . i want my ring back .
okay , i &apos;ll take it off .
just put it back on my finger before you lose it .
oh , ho @-@ ho @-@ ho @-@ ho . check it out .
goldnerd &apos;s proposing to his mom , and she said &quot; yes &quot; !
that &apos;s not what happened !
oh , she said &quot; no . &quot;
there . you happy now ?
i do . i mean ... i am .
hi , mr. goldberg .
thanks for coming . my dad &apos;s excited to meet you .
hey , barry .
oh , hey , there he is .
dad , you know barry , mr. goldberg .
yep . hey , bill lewis of bill lewis tile and flooring .
murray goldberg of this moron &apos;s father .
classic mur @-@ man . he kids .
big game today . you guys are lucky
&apos;cause i just bought a brand @-@ new big @-@ screen tv
to watch it on .
what you got ? 27 &quot; ?
32 &quot; ? 34 &quot; ?
53 &quot; of pure magic , my friend .
you are a dirty liar .
come here .
oh ... my ... god . it &apos;s real .
ah , the &apos; 80s projection tv .
it was blurry and weighed more than a car ,
but it was the envy of every man .
i know we just met ...
but i want to live with you , bill . i choose you .
wow . i think this may work .
and it did ... for about two more seconds .
murray , you can come over for any game you want .
everybody &apos;s welcome in cowboy country .
good god . what is this place ?
i think he said &quot; cowboy country . &quot;
isn &apos;t it great ?
how could you do this to me ?
they &apos;re cowboy fans .
i can &apos;t watch the biggest game of the year
in enemy territory !
i &apos;m sorry , okay ? lainey didn &apos;t tell me .
i did . remember ?
i told you all about it in your room --
when we were studying .
you can &apos;t expect me to listen to what you &apos;re saying
while we &apos;re ... studying .
morons ! i know what &quot; studying &quot; means !
look , you can still root for the eagles --
just not out loud .
please . it &apos;s going so well . my dad actually likes you .
he never likes anyone .
fine . i will stay for one quarter .
but after that , i go home and watch with my chair .
who wants some barbecued eagle ?
i &apos;m just fooling . it &apos;s chicken .
but that &apos;s what the eagles are , right ?
a bunch of chickens .
as livid as my dad was ,
it didn &apos;t come close to the rage in my heart .
stop your stomping .
i get it -- your little feet are mad .
but you are much too young
to be giving little girls big , honking sparklers .
fine ! i &apos;ll just get her a ring of my own !
i &apos;ll mow every damn lawn in this town if i have to .
what do i need to score a ring like that , huh ?
10 , 12 g &apos;s ?
you know what ?
i thought we were gonna be able to
discuss this like reasonable people .
but clearly , your little body &apos;s all worked up .
stop calling my parts little !
i &apos;m a man ! a big man !
well , you &apos;re grounded , big man .
that means no computer , no television ,
no phone , no dana .
don &apos;t look at me like that . i know what you &apos;re thinking .
but he crossed a line with that ring .
and don &apos;t tell me
i &apos;m trying to keep him a baby forever
because i &apos;m not , although he is growing up
at an alarming rate .
and this isn &apos;t because i am devastated or jealous
or threatened that he &apos;s got a new woman in his life .
because she is not a woman . she is a girl .
and i am the woman .
i &apos;m his mother , of course , but he &apos;s mine --
ours , all of ours .
shut up !
hey . you okay ?
no , i &apos;m not okay !
dana &apos;s at the water tower right now with anthony balsamo .
i can &apos;t let him swoop in on my gal .
i got to fix this .
oh , good -- you came up with another great way
for a robot to solve your problems .
i will let love and eight &quot; d &quot; batteries
carry my letter to dana at the water tower .
there &apos;s nothing that can stand in omnibot &apos;s way -- nothing !
omnibot , no ! you know grass is your kryptonite !
well , here &apos;s an idea . a real man would find dana himself .
i can &apos;t . you heard mom .
she would ground me forever .
well , maybe some things in life are just worth it .
in that moment , i realized erica was right .
it was time to stop letting a robot do a man &apos;s job .
run ! run and show her what a man you are !
what a tiny , little man you are .
and it &apos;s good !
three on the board !
three on the board .
three on the board . three on the board .
sweet lord . make him stop .
you know , dick vermeil
has no business coaching men &apos;s football .
maybe -- at best -- women &apos;s volleyball .
not the olympic kind .
like a casual , two @-@ woman game on a beach ,
am i right , mur ?
after a quarter of agony , my dad was
at his breaking point , and then this happened .
oh ! oh , yeah ! mike quick !
just beat the kicker ! just beat the kicker !
go ! go ! go ! go ! go ! touchdown !
oh , crap .
we &apos;re done .
yeah .
you &apos;re an eagles fan ?
this is , uh , philadelphia ,
and i root for two teams --
the eagles and whoever &apos;s playing the cowboys .
but at least we all can agree the giants suck ,
am i right ?
in my house , we root for one team and one team only .
that &apos;s america &apos;s team .
if anyone &apos;s america &apos;s team , it &apos;s philly --
home of the liberty bell , ben franklin , and rocky .
your city &apos;s so bad you could only come up
with is a mediocre boxing movie and a broken bell .
okay , we &apos;re all saying things that are hurtful and untrue .
i say we hug .
we &apos;ll start . you guys join .
no .
i never understood why you liked this bonehead .
but after meeting his dad , i really don &apos;t get it .
i don &apos;t have to sit here and watch my son be insulted
by a man who sells the fourth @-@ best type of flooring .
oh , no . oh , no .
oh , no .
there &apos;s only one thing worse than bad @-@ mouthing the cowboys ,
and that &apos;s talking nonsense about tile .
you can &apos;t name one better flooring option ! not one !
carpet , wood , linoleum ,
brick , marble , astroturf .
enough !
it &apos;ll be a cold day in hell when my daughter dates
a no @-@ good , tile @-@ hating eagle fan .
i think you guys should leave .
i &apos;m a step ahead of you !
stop it . what is that ?
i am an eagle , flying on my wings to victory .
eagles don &apos;t &quot; ca @-@ caw ! &quot;
nobody knows the sound an eagle makes !
nobody !
barry .
eagles don &apos;t &quot; ca @-@ caw . &quot;
as barry was watching his first love fly away ,
i was getting ready to climb to new heights
to show dana what a man looked like .
adam ? i thought you were grounded .
this is how grounded i &apos;m not .
wait . you can &apos;t climb that . it &apos;s too dangerous .
dana isabelle caldwell , you &apos;re worth it .
and so , my climb into greatness began .
sure , i was a clumsy doof with limited hand and leg strength ,
but i wouldn &apos;t let my shortcomings stop me .
i had to show anthony balsamo and the rest of my school
that adam goldberg was the manliest of men .
it was my moment .
the wind was at my back , my heart was pounding ,
and i knew exactly what i needed to write
to show all of jenkintown that dana was my girl .
nothing on god &apos;s green earth could stop me .
no !
come on ! damn it !
well , nothing except for an empty can of spray paint .
oh , balls !
do you know that guy , dan ?
not that well .
even more unfortunate ...
oh , balls !
i got so swept up in being man
that i &apos;d forgotten about my crippling fear or heights .
also unfortunate , they had to call the fire department .
turns out , being swaddled like a baby
didn &apos;t help my case on proving my manhood .
hey , you okay , bro ?
dan .
even though the eagles lost pretty bad that day ,
barry was taking his loss even harder .
the hell are you doing ?
just sorting through the treasures of our relationship .
flyers shirt she hated ,
the stop sign where she wanted to go left
and i wanted to go right ,
so i got nervous , went straight .
you might not understand this ,
but ... eagles and cowboys just don &apos;t mix .
you and lainey were doomed from the start .
we just root for different teams .
so what ?
so it gets complicated .
i &apos;ve seen people try ,
but it &apos;s , uh -- well , that &apos;s a tough life .
you &apos;re living in the past !
i don &apos;t see teams . i see people .
everyone sees teams .
well , as much as i care about the eagles ...
i care about lainey more .
that &apos;s a damn big thing to say .
i know it is .
you better mean it .
i do .
well , let &apos;s get in the damn car .
and bring the stop sign .
we got to put it back . it &apos;s a serious crime .
bill , we need to talk .
i &apos;ve got nothing to say to you .
look , i know things got personal .
you said some things about rocky .
i said some things about floor tiling .
we got great kids , and they like each other .
so let &apos;s just move past this .
mur , i &apos;m a reasonable man .
i &apos;ll let lainey see barry
if you admit the cowboys are america &apos;s team .
reasonable ? that &apos;s not reasonable .
that &apos;s the opposite of reasonable .
dad , come on .
let him try it on .
i &apos;ll do it .
wait , seriously ?
the cowboys are ...
w @-@ what &apos;s that ?
cowboys ...
i couldn &apos;t quite hear you . - cowboys --
even though my brother liked lainey more than the eagles ,
he hated watching our dad get ridiculed .
the cowboys ...
suck !
they suck ! the cowboys suck !
i &apos;m sorry , lainey . they suck so hard .
i think we &apos;re done here .
damn right we are !
stop it !
eagles don &apos;t make that noise !
it makes no sense !
while barry and my dad were flying high ,
erica was trying to keep my smother grounded .
where is he ? where is my boy ?
i &apos;m sorry . i can &apos;t hear you .
tell me where my favorite child is ,
or this is gonna get real mean .
meaner than that ?
cut it out .
do what you will , i won &apos;t crack .
wow . standing up for your brother .
i &apos;m proud of you , really .
what are you doing ?
just demonstrating
how i &apos;ll be showing up to school next year
if you don &apos;t start talking .
you think a few curlers scare me ?
wow . you put those in fast . you &apos;re like a hair ninja .
oh , it won &apos;t just be curlers .
it &apos;ll be the whole pre @-@ bedtime routine .
hi , erica . it &apos;s me , your mother .
he &apos;s at the water tower .
you &apos;re weak .
i know .
you are in so much trouble , mister !
you thought you were grounded before ?
well , you are really grounded now .
it doesn &apos;t matter !
after tonight , dana will never want to see me again anyway .
what happened ?
you were right . i &apos;m a little boy .
and every time i try and be a man ,
i just end up proving i &apos;m the farthest thing from it .
i just -- i hate who i am right now .
don &apos;t say that .
look , i know this is hard for you to understand ,
but this period of your life ...
... it &apos;s only gonna last a little while .
i &apos;m sure , for you , it seems like it &apos;ll last forever .
but believe me , it doesn &apos;t .
in fact , for me , it all seems like
it &apos;s just going by so fast .
just take me home .
okay . here &apos;s your stop .
but this is dana &apos;s house .
yeah . go talk to her .
really ? y @-@ you said i wasn &apos;t allowed to see her anymore .
i know what i said . go .
adam ?
we need to talk .
o @-@ okay , i &apos;ll come down .
no , wait . i @-@ i &apos;ll come up .
that night , i was determined to climb my way into manhood .
or at least make it to dana &apos;s window
without having to be rescued by firemen .
you know , you really need to stop climbing things .
look , all i wanted was to be seen as your boyfriend ,
not some little kid .
no one thinks that .
of course they do . look at me .
adam , look at me .
people think i &apos;m in high school ,
and they stare at me , and it sucks .
i don &apos;t want to go to their parties .
i just want to ride my bike and play video games .
with you .
that sounds awesome .
so , now what ?
now i kiss you ?
i &apos;m good with that .
i can &apos;t believe you were actually gonna say
the cowboys were better than the eagles for me .
for your information , i was never going to say that .
oh , you were gonna say it .
i wasn &apos;t going to say it .
you were gonna say it .
okay , maybe i like you
a little bit more than the eagles .
don &apos;t tell the eagles .
lainey , what are you --
my dad hates your guts . oh , my god . he hates you so much .
he forbid me from ever seeing you again .
well , thanks for delivering that message in person .
don &apos;t you get it ? he forbid me .
forbidden love ! that is so hot !
oh , can &apos;t you guys just wait until i leave the room
before you start studying ?
i just ate .
oh , and by the way , even though the cowboys suck ,
i think barry chose well .
i chose him .
it &apos;s my green lantern ring .
it &apos;s actually not worth anything , but -- - i love it .
that &apos;s the thing about young love .
it &apos;s weird . it &apos;s awkward . it &apos;s confusing as hell .
but no matter what size you are , it &apos;s worth it .
holy why ?
hi , erica .
okay , fine ! you got me !
but i was only in atlantic city for a few hours ,
and i wasn &apos;t even with those dudes when they were arrested .
adam forgot his lunch . i just brought it to him .
you said you would come to school --
i thought you knew .
i didn &apos;t .
then why are you here dressed as my worst nightmare ?
&apos;cause some mornings , it &apos;s just tougher to get it together than others .
now , moving on to your punishment ?
oh , i love you , too , erica ! yes !
this is my daughter .
i made her in my tummy .
