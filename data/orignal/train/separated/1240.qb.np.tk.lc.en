charlotte was dead when she was thrown from the bell tower .
she was murdered ?
i think the person the cop should really be
talking to is right over there .
she chose to help charlotte torture us .
mm . god , i missed you .
never been really good with needles .
you live in california
but you &apos;re doing your treatments here ?
the family that campaigns together , stays together .
they won &apos;t take back the advance .
they &apos;re not going to love the follow @-@ up .
it &apos;s time to tell us what really happened that night .
you left the hotel with ezra and you came back a half hour
after charlotte was killed .
we didn &apos;t see each other the night that charlotte was killed .
you didn &apos;t call me . i didn &apos;t leave the hotel .
we didn &apos;t walk or talk or go anywhere .
whatever you say , aria .
i &apos;ve never had a salt rub . does it hurt ?
can &apos;t be worse than a sugar wax .
why didn &apos;t she meet us here ?
spencer , let it go .
why lie ?
why not just say i snuck out to go meet ezra ?
she &apos;s got a boyfriend in cambridge .
oh , please , this is about so much more than that .
if we had never told her about that
security tape , she wouldn &apos;t have--
this is so not relaxing .
hanna , the police didn &apos;t ask us
to stick around to exfoliate .
there are gonna be questions .
aria doesn &apos;t know where ezra went after she left him .
yeah , but she knows that he was in a dark place .
just &apos; cause you &apos;re depressed doesn &apos;t mean
you pick up a weapon .
ok you guys , my mom gave us these passes as a gift .
we &apos;re here to chill , not spill .
it &apos;s just so twisted .
she hasn &apos;t even spoken to fitz in , like , five years
and now if he did this for her
they &apos;re gonna be bound together forever .
not because of the tape . it &apos;s gone .
what ? you erased it ?
when ?
doesn &apos;t matter . it &apos;s done .
what do you guys think this room was
before they turned the nuthouse into a spa ?
why ?
the sauna smelled like burned hair .
okay , that &apos;s it . i &apos;m done chilling .
wait , what are you guys doing ?
i &apos;m gonna get dressed .
i have to meet with melissa .
we have a meeting with my mom &apos;s campaign team .
yeah , i think i wanna go too .
well , we can &apos;t leave .
we have appointments ! you can &apos;t do this .
come on , guys .
i left my key in there .
sara ?
how long have you been there ?
and why are you following me ?
first the cemetery and now here ?
i wasn &apos;t following you .
i was saying goodbye to someone .
who ? charlotte ?
the person you claimed in court scrambled your brains
and stole your soul ?
why did you even come to rosewood ?
answer me !
last time i checked , this was the quiet room .
it &apos;s no sweat if you can &apos;t find it .
no , i have printed everything out .
this whole stack is coverage .
just resend the e @-@ mail .
jillian &apos;s not back till tomorrow .
is that a stuffed pig behind you ?
yeah , that &apos;s pigtunia .
wait , is there a picture
of justin timberlake on one of those walls ?
wait a second , thought you said that
jillian wasn &apos;t back till friday .
nah , she &apos;s coming back early .
you don &apos;t freak out the fitz pages .
she &apos;s , um , kind of over him .
what does that mean ?
i guess she called your old teacher yesterday
and said he sounded wasted at 11 : 00 in the morning .
he wasn &apos;t wasted .
the man is dealing with a lot of grief right now .
whoa . well , don &apos;t scorch me . i &apos;m a fan .
i think the guy &apos;s definitely got more stories to tell .
i gotta go . hey , don &apos;t lose sleep over fitz .
he &apos;ll share when he &apos;s ready , okay ?
detective calderon , what &apos;s this regarding ?
my colleagues are studying the hotel &apos;s security footage
from the night charlotte dilaurentis was murdered .
yes , i already gave them access to everything .
you did , but apparently
there was nothing recorded after midnight .
the tape skips to noon the next day .
oh ! well , i &apos;m not really well @-@ versed in the technical--
me neither .
but we have an it specialist trying to determine
where was a malfunction of the device or ..
or ?
whether it was deleted .
i &apos;m sorry . what are you implying ?
we haven &apos;t reached any conclusions yet , ma &apos;am .
i will need a list of the staff that worked that shift
and the hotel guests who stayed here that night .
well , there are no health food stores here , claudia .
believe me , i grew up here .
i thought butter was a side dish .
yeah . yeah , i &apos;ll overnight the magnesium .
well , what day is it in tokyo .
okay , well then you &apos;ll get it yesterday .
hello ? claudia .
hanna ?
lucas ! my god . what are you doing here ?
didn &apos;t you see me waving ? i honked at you .
wait , that was you in the silver jag ?
can you look a little less shocked ?
i am not shocked , i &apos;m impressed . how are you ?
last time i heard , you were , like , movin &apos; to chicago .
uh , seattle . but i sold that company .
i do game apps now .
uh , do you still live with your folks ?
oh , uh , no , i , uh , have a condo in palo alto
and a town house in hong kong
and a loft above the grille .
but , hey ! look at you . sporting bling .
did caleb finally propose ?
no . no .
uh , caleb and i , we split up a few years ago .
but my fiance , jordan , we live in new york .
wow ! now i &apos;m shocked .
well , you know , we &apos;re still friends .
probably my boss .
is everything okay ?
yeah . yeah , everything &apos;s fine .
um , you know what , i gotta go .
but i @-@ i wanna drive that car .
oh , i forgot you were camping out here .
yeah , me and the other water bugs .
where &apos;s spencer ?
she &apos;s just finishing up the strategy session with gil .
hey , what about , uh , her college paper ?
how did they react to that ?
they asked her to adjust her interview style .
i know i had more clothes here .
hey .
hi .
how did it go ?
not good .
they asked me to lie .
they don &apos;t want you to lie .
okay , want me to use a non @-@ denial denial .
so lying .
yeah .
if you can avoid addressing certain things , you should .
no , don &apos;t take off your shoes .
we &apos;ve to be at hollis in 30 minutes .
what is this hollis thing ? gil asked me to post about it .
registering college kids to vote
to try to reverse the political apathy of our youth .
that &apos;s noble .
it &apos;s really not .
it &apos;s a photo @-@ op for the candidate &apos;s children
who are starving .
okay , well , i &apos;ll make some eggs .
uh , do you want some toast ?
oh , my god , please .
burned .
that &apos;s the only way i make it .
i &apos;m gonna go steal some stuff from the campaign headquarters .
when did that happen ?
what ?
caleb ? we &apos;re friends .
really ?
&apos;cause i know how you like to shop out of other people &apos;s carts .
if you &apos;re referring to hanna
that cart is engaged to someone else .
it really doesn &apos;t matter because there &apos;s nothing going on .
maybe you &apos;re more comfortable with lying than you think .
uh , are you leaving ?
i thought we were having lunch today .
yeah , i just had to pick up a few things from the drugstore .
you know , i only planned on being here for a day or two .
do you need anything ?
no .
you know , i spoke with , with will perkins .
your dad &apos;s friend , the medic .
and he &apos;d be happy to write you a recommendation
for grad school .
um , you didn &apos;t have to do that . it &apos;s ...
are you kidding ? i wanted to .
alright . um , see you later .
艾米丽 · 菲尔兹
em , emily !
hear what ?
that you had nothing to do with that security tape .
if you or your friends tampered--
i didn &apos;t .
why would i have to tamper with it ?
i &apos;m not in high school anymore .
ashley , excuse me . jen just took this message for you .
thank you .
well , it gets worse .
what ? what &apos;s wrong ? who &apos;s that from ?
it &apos;s from detective calderon .
they just confirmed that the tape was erased .
and they want me to go down to the precinct
this afternoon for further questioning .
why do they need to speak to you ?
they &apos;re investigating murder , hanna .
i have a daughter who was staying here
who was once tortured by the victim .
don &apos;t look so surprised .
do you know what you want ?
what ?
oh , no . um , i &apos;m good .
just whatever you &apos;re having , you can order two of them .
excuse me . sorry . are you our waiter ?
great . um , i &apos;ll have a , a beer .
anything you have on draft will be great .
what about you ?
iced tea , thank you .
so , um ..
i looked at that thumb drive that i took from your place .
that &apos;s just research .
ezra , there were some horrifying images .
yeah , i know . i ..
uh , is @-@ is there anything else on there other than research ?
here .
there . that &apos;s ... what i have .
uh , i started the first chapter in colombia
and i was about
halfway through the second when ... nicole ...
look , it &apos;s crap . it &apos;s crap .
and i know that you don &apos;t wanna give up
until i hand it over , so there it is .
hello there . forgive interruption .
your waiter will be right over with two iced teas .
um , i , i ordered a beer .
i know , ezra . we can &apos;t serve you that .
you , are you kidding me ?
what &apos;s going on ?
please , this is awkward .
look , ashley , nobody broke a chair .
it was an incident .
i &apos;m sorry .
enjoy your lunch .
thank you .
what &apos;s your take on that ?
why is the turnout of millennial voters so sluggish ?
well , most young people don &apos;t have a permanent address
so it &apos;s very difficult for them to register .
so are you sticking around rosewood solely for your mom
or are there other things keeping you here ?
the death of charlotte dilaurentis
must have thrown you ?
yes , and how could it not ?
this person had a huge impact on my life .
and it does take time to process
an upsetting event before one can move on .
i &apos;m surprised you &apos;d use the word upsetting .
most people on social media assume that you &apos;re celebrating .
well , the media &apos;s gonna create the narrative they wanna tell .
so you object to that narrative ?
no , what i object to
are people who are desperate to find a connection .
sometimes a cigar is just a cigar .
can you excuse me for just a moment ?
sure .
what are you doing here ?
my mom &apos;s in trouble .
emily .
emily .
emily .
mom , what &apos;s the matter ?
maybe you can explain this .
was it all just lies ? i mean , all the ..
all the details from
mom , please .
i must &apos;ve looked like an idiot , sending you care packages
because you didn &apos;t like the food in the cafeteria .
when did you drop out ?
mom , can we please not talk about this here ? please ?
no , uh !
fine .
lorenzo knows the tape was erased , alright ?
so you have to ask your mom--
no .
my mom &apos;s not an attorney right now .
she &apos;s a candidate .
i cannot ask her anything and i can &apos;t talk to you right now .
i &apos;m in the middle of an interview .
spencer , the police have a list of everyone
who stayed at the hotel that night .
someone was murdered and you &apos;re gonna get questioned .
we all are .
hey , i &apos;m so sorry about that .
wasn &apos;t that one of the other girls from the bunker ?
is she still in town because of charlotte ?
you know what , i think that maybe
i should just get back to registering the students .
wait . just one more question .
no , i &apos;m sorry . i really don &apos;t have time .
i &apos;m only here to spread the message
be inspired to create the future that you imagine by voting .
thank you .
i don &apos;t understand , emily .
it wasn &apos;t a decision . it just ... happened .
did you get kicked out ?
no .
honey , why didn &apos;t you call me
if you were going through something ?
mom , you worried if i skipped a meal .
how was i suppose to tell you i was skipping school ?
did you get that at a costume shop ?
i &apos;m goin &apos; home .
hi .
hi .
i need your help .
do you want anything to drink ?
i haven &apos;t been here in a while
but there might be an old coconut water in the fridge--
i &apos;ll pass .
do you live here alone ?
well , i had a hamster
but i &apos;m out of town all the time , so he ..
were you here the night that
charlotte dilaurentis was killed ?
why ?
after the hearing , we all went back to the hotel
and we got trashed .
and ?
we collapsed in my room .
but now the police think that we snuck out
and we killed a or charlotte .
well , i was thinking maybe ..
... maybe you could say that you came to my room
and you @-@ you brought me take @-@ out
and we talked until the sun came up .
you know what ?
forget that . um , i &apos;m sorry i even asked .
you want me to be your alibi ?
no . no , i don &apos;t .
i really didn &apos;t think this through .
let &apos;s just pretend that i never came here .
hey , when you &apos;re in new york , let &apos;s get dinner .
uh , hanna .
you need me , i &apos;m there for you .
&quot; and still there they were stars reeling overhead
&quot; the earth barely moving beneath them .
&quot; he knew in that moment
&quot; whether they made it through this night or not
he finally found his match . &quot;
okay , is it just me or is this amazing ?
uh , i @-@ i @-@ i mean
there &apos;s some stuff that needs connective tissue--
is he writin &apos; about you ?
what ?
what are you talking about ? no .
this book is about him and nicole .
well , i &apos;m just saying the description--
she was small like me . big deal .
ezra likes small women . get a grip .
why would you say that ?
aria , you guys went through a lot together .
that was high school .
not for him .
why are you so upset ?
it &apos;s just been a rough couple of days .
and we &apos;re readin &apos; an unfinished novel
by somebody who may have killed--
emily , don &apos;t .
he said he went home .
okay , well , tell me why sara harvey won &apos;t ..
... go home ?
everywhere i go , she &apos;s been shadowing me
like some dark cloud .
i &apos;m afraid that she might know something .
i mean , was she sitting in that lobby that night ?
wait . can &apos;t hanna &apos;s mom just kick her out of the hotel ?
for what ? you can &apos;t evict somebody
for eating fried chicken with gloves .
okay , well , just stop thinking about her .
go get the dinner with your mom .
no .
i &apos;ll sit here .
hi .
hi .
uh , come in .
what &apos;s this ?
uh , research .
my boss wants to buy a cat while she &apos;s in asia .
they have this weird breed with super short legs .
they call them munchkins .
it &apos;s only slightly offensive .
yeah . well , so is my boss .
look , i &apos;m really sorry
about the way that i talked to you today .
i was just so focused on trying to be my mom &apos;s savior--
no , it &apos;s fine . lucas is gonna help us .
he is gonna be our alibi .
really ?
um , is that munchkin lover ?
no , jordan calling me to say goodnight .
oh , let me give you guys a-- - no , it &apos;s fine .
i &apos;ll just call him back .
you seem really happy .
so , um , is it weird now for you to
for you to see caleb ?
no .
i &apos;m getting married , spencer .
god , why does everybody keep asking me about caleb ?
i , i didn &apos;t realize anybody else had .
so ... do you have feelings for ..
so when you , um ..
when you guys , uh , met up in spain , did you--
no , no , i would never do that to you .
i &apos;d .. no .
and i don &apos;t even know if he feels the same way .
well , then ..
... i think that you should find out .
i figured if anyone could decipher
your chicken scratch , it &apos;d be me .
but there were even a few words that i couldn &apos;t--
why did you do this ?
&apos;cause i @-@ i thought that maybe if you ...
saw it in a different form , it ...
would inspire you to pick up where you left off .
it &apos;s really good , ezra .
really good .
look , forget about who i work for . okay ?
i don &apos;t give a damn what anyone else thinks .
this is me talking .
you need to finish this book .
i want entire world to know who you really are .
you are compassionate
sensitive .
you &apos;re kind .
maybe i &apos;m not .
damian .
spencer .
hey .
hi .
uh , i wasn &apos;t , uh , expecting you .
are you here to finish our interview ?
i came to ask you if your article was really about
millennials and politics or if you have another angle ?
the bunker girls .
um , i think you need to relax .
i &apos;m writing about the 20 @-@ something children
of senatorial candidates .
i don &apos;t , i don &apos;t have an agenda .
really ?
really .
then why are you playing phone tag
with mona vanderwaal ?
is she gonna offer you some fresh insight
into charlotte &apos;s dollhouse ?
uh , no , she &apos;s scheduling a sit @-@ down
with the opponent &apos;s daughter .
what ?
mona &apos;s working for the other camp .
i &apos;m sorry . when did this happen ?
well , don &apos;t look at me .
apparently mona approached your mom
about working for her campaign first
but was shown the door .
you really didn &apos;t know .
i &apos;ve heard of inner circles , but leaving your daughter out ...
that &apos;s cold .
when do you have to go in ?
5 : 00 .
he already grilled my mom .
alright , hanna .
don &apos;t forget . this is lorenzo , not wilden .
he &apos;s not bent on making ali &apos;s friends look like--
friends ?
have you heard from ali since that dinner ?
have you ?
alison is not looking to make any more friendship bracelets .
i thought you said lucas was gonna help .
you &apos;re worry he won &apos;t come through ?
i &apos;m worried about everything , emily .
my mom losing her job , my boss firing me
because i didn &apos;t send the right laxative to tokyo .
everything !
do you wanna mix that with water ?
no .
god , i hate that i &apos;m in that place
and being forced to lie like
i &apos;m in 11th grade all over again .
oh , it &apos;s liam .
hey , you got a minute ?
sure , what &apos;s up ?
why are you unbuttoning your shirt ?
uh , i have to go pick up jillian &apos;s mother at logan
and take her to this trustee thing at the gardner .
i &apos;m officially a male escort for 80 @-@ year @-@ old cougars .
liam ?
i am not alone . hanna and emily are here .
hey , guys .
hi .
i just wanted to give you a quick update .
um , jillian said if she doesn &apos;t have something from fitz
by tomorrow , she &apos;s moving on .
what ? why ?
she left me this long message saying that he was a fraud
and he was two months away from teaching creative writing
on a cruise ship .
okay . well , she &apos;s wrong .
she &apos;ll have something on her desk by tomorrow .
will you tell her that , please ?
i miss you .
i miss you too .
what ?
why are you worried about his book ?
those are words . who cares about the stuff he makes up ?
why don &apos;t you ask him for the truth
about the night charlotte was killed ?
what was that ?
timer ... on my phone .
my mom asked me to meet her .
i &apos;ve to use the bathroom .
what are you gonna say if the police call you in ?
are you telling them that you met up with fitz ?
no , i was asleep the whole time , remember ?
oh , hanna , no , no .
please drop that in kitchen .
hey , are you getting out of here ?
yeah . i just have a few work e @-@ mails to deal with .
emily , i saw you in the bathroom .
i don &apos;t know what you mean .
em , it &apos;s me .
are you sick ?
no .
i &apos;m broke .
what @-@ what about the salk institute ?
it &apos;s not real .
i mean , the place is , i just ..
i don &apos;t have a job there .
what &apos;s going on ?
the last couple of years have just been a lot harder
than i made them sound .
i left school
and i blew through all the money that my dad left me .
and that &apos;s why when one of the girls
that i bartend with told me about it ..
told you about what ?
donating my eggs .
wait . that &apos;s what the injections are for ?
you have to take a lot of hormones before the procedure .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m havin &apos; it done here .
em , you don &apos;t have to do this . i &apos;ll lend you money--
no . no , it &apos;s okay .
i want to .
i mean ..
for the first time in forever
i actually feel good about a choice i &apos;ve made .
i &apos;m gonna help two people start a family .
i just wish you would have told me sooner .
i didn &apos;t know how .
well , whoever they are
they are the luckiest couple in the world .
so you reached out to a friend
you hadn &apos;t seen in , what , five years ?
lucas and i were close .
and were any of the others awake for this 3 a.m. snack ?
no . i mean , i &apos;m the only one
who even eats fried mozzarella sticks .
do you mind if invite someone else to join us ?
can you come in here , please ?
maybe you can help us ?
hanna doesn &apos;t seem to recall letting you into the hotel .
she didn &apos;t . there was another guest leaving as i got there .
can you describe this guest ?
uh , a man .
i didn &apos;t get a good look . my hands were full of greasy bags .
why were you so eager to drop off food
in the middle of the night ?
hanna called .
and i was happy to hear her voice .
and she sound little tipsy
so i thought that maybe we could have little bit of fun .
talking . he means talking .
we talked until the sun came up .
mm . now were you drinking alcohol too ?
nope . ice water .
was it in the room ?
i would &apos;ve thought that ice set out
at turn @-@ down would have melted .
i went to get more .
so you left the room ?
just a walk down the hall to the ice machine .
was it down the hall ?
&apos;cause according to my records , radley doesn &apos;t have
an ice closet on the third floor .
melissa , what &apos;s wrong ?
i &apos;m a idiot .
i totally botched things with that reporter from hollis .
with damian ? you talked to him ?
i wouldn &apos;t exactly call it talking .
more like nervous blurting .
okay . what did you blurt ?
everything was going fine ,
but then he got up to take a phone call
and when he came back , his questions changed .
and i saw words written on his pad .
what were the words ?
i could only make out a few .
but they really freaked me out .
source , cover @-@ up and tape .
what ever happened to that tape i made you ?
the one where i talked about the night that alison disappeared ?
oh , my god , melissa . it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s gone . it &apos;s gone !
i destroyed it !
stop . don &apos;t be paranoid .
oh , never mind . she &apos;s here .
i want an answer
to the question i asked you yesterday .
why are you here ?
the police asked me to stay . i might be able to help .
i &apos;m talking about the funeral .
if charlotte was as horrible as you told the judge she was
why did you go ?
did you lie in court ?
was it all an act , so you could walk out like a victim ?
i &apos;m lucky i was able to walk out of there at all .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
i don &apos;t know about the others
but i know you feel guilty , emily .
guilty , i have nothing to feel guilty about .
should i take these gloves off ?
sara , i couldn &apos;t have done anything , okay ?
none of us could . it all happened so quick ..
who are you trying to convince ?
me or you ?
we need to talk , the others are on their way
and we can &apos;t do this in front of them .
what others ?
look , ezra .
i know you &apos;re lost right now .
i know youu &apos;re filled
with anger and you &apos;re full of despair--
well , what the hell are you talking about ?
charlotte !
for god &apos;s sake , don &apos;t make me say it , ezra !
look , i know why you did what you did
and i will do whatever it takes to help you .
i swear if you want me to lie for you , i will .
i know that you did this to protect me .
oh , god . now don &apos;t , don &apos;t answer it . not yet .
is she already here ?
do come in . join the party .
anybody bring torches , pitchforks ?
anything like that ?
you didn &apos;t protect aria , okay ?
i protected aria !
hanna--
and we are not gonna go down for this
because you thought that you had to slay the dragon !
hanna , please--
what ?
my mom may go down for this too .
he needs to own up to what he did !
hanna , just let me talk .
look , you can say that it was self @-@ defense .
charlotte had a very long history of throwing
the first punch and nobody would ever question you .
they can &apos;t ! you seem to already have all the answers .
ezra , it wasn &apos;t just some random car that hit her , okay ?
somebody planned this to make it look like she jumped .
and you might have already had that plan in your head ,
that paper that i wrote , texas vs. kellner .
you read it the summer before i published it
when we met up at dupont circle right before your reading .
okay . it &apos;s time for you to leave .
not until you &apos;re honest with us .
honest , emily ?
you are not asking me to change your grade
you are asking me to confess to a murder .
where did you go that night after you left aria ?
why the hell can &apos;t you tell us ?
emily , leave him alone .
why ?
sara harvey won &apos;t leave us alone .
she &apos;s sticking around rosewood to punish us , aria !
yeah , she &apos;s good at that .
and she will use this against us
until it looks like we planned this
and ezra just carried out our wishes !
it &apos;s time to go .
now ! get out !
okay . we &apos;re gonna leave .
but you two better figure this out
before the police do .
you need to leave too .
ezra ?
how long have you known me ?
who do you think i am ? hmm ?
i don &apos;t know .
you &apos;re not the same person i said goodbye to
in front of the brew that summer .
you &apos;re right .
and i &apos;m not going to pretend that i am sorry
that the person who made your life a living hell
who tormented you five years later
i am not going to say i &apos;m sorry that they are dead
&apos;cause i am not .
were you waiting up for me ?
no .
i was just reading &quot; the gardener &apos;s desk reference . &quot;
where have you been ?
are you okay ?
yeah , i &apos;m just ..
i met up wh hanna and emily .
um , when you first heard that
charlotte was killed
where did your mind go ?
mean as in like who did it ?
i mean sara harvey was pretty high on that list .
why ?
i don &apos;t that she did it .
but ... i do think that she remembers more
than she &apos;s letting on .
i &apos;m not following .
hanna really didn &apos;t tell you ?
tell me what ?
about what happened the night of the prom .
when we went to radley
and we met ali on the roof to try to stop--
everyone knows that . e @-@ even the cops .
yeah , but something happened before that ..
nobody knows about .
she &apos;s headed to the roof . please help me !
hey !
i tried to keep you safe .
oh , my god !
stop . don &apos;t touch her .
oh , my god !
you were given an impossible choice .
yeah , i know , that &apos;s ..
that &apos;s what i always try to tell myself , but ..
... what if that &apos;s not true ?
what if all of those years
of being stalked and tortured ..
... what if that hardened me ?
like maybe it happened so slowly
that i don &apos;t even know that it was happening .
hey , listen to me .
you are a good person .
yes , you are .
and you , you wear your heart on your sleeve .
it just happens to be the sleeve of a flak jacket .
sorry , i didn &apos;t call , i ..
come , sit .
i want you to promise me something .
mom , it &apos;s been a really long day . i just--
i never want you to go through something alone .
we can go through it together .
promise ?
yeah .
did you get my messages ?
yeah .
i had no right to ask you to do that .
you don &apos;t have to answer me
but did you have something to do with alison &apos;s sister
falling of bell tower ?
no .
you &apos;re braver than my mom .
she &apos;s been wanting to ask me the same thing , but ..
... i think she &apos;s scared of the answer .
she can barely look at me .
waking up in my old room gets harder and harder every day .
what &apos;s this for ?
i &apos;ve to go off to san jose tomorrow .
you &apos;re welcome to stay here as long as you want .
have you eaten ?
hello .
you okay ? did i wake you ?
no . no . what &apos;s up ?
um , you know , those chapters you sent ?
jillian ate them up .
she devoured them like the carnivore she denies she is .
wait , wait .
she read them already ? and she liked them ?
you &apos;re officially the book whisperer .
what do you mean ?
whatever you &apos;re doing , just keep doing it .
thank you .
... for not judging me .
i just wish you hadn &apos;t judged yourself .
there &apos;s , um ..
there &apos;s something else ..
... that i &apos;ve been judging myself for .
