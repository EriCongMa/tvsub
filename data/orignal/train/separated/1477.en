I didn't say anything.
Stop talking.
That's talking.
You think she's asleep yet?
I'm on the same side of the door as you are.
Stop talking.
Cam.
Lily lost her first tooth today.
And she's very excited about the visit from the tooth fairy.
When I have my first loose tooth,
my mom tied one end of the string to it,
the other to the tail of a cow
fired off a 12-gauge shotgun,
and the cow went running out of the room.
That never happened.
Tell that to the cow-shaped hole in my bedroom wall.
Gotcha!
what are you doing here?
You're not the tooth fairy.
N-no. But we just wanted to see if she'd come yet.
No. She sure is taking her sweet time.
Maybe you should just go back to sleep, sweetie.
Yeah.
'cause it could take a while.
I've got nowhere to be.
Mom, I can't be late today.
Sanjay Patel and I are dissecting a pig.
So sad what passes for a date in your life.
Haley.
He keeps asking me to hand him all of the instruments.
He wants me to act like a nurse.
Now it sounds like a date in Haley's life.
Okay, before you say no...
No.
You haven't even seen it yet.
Mm, I'm sticking with "No."
It's for Luke's Career Day.
I thought I'd offer the kids a chance
to put their face on my body.
I just heard it, too.
How come you guys never had a Career Day?
Cutbacks.
Nor'easter.
Today I get to talk about the love of my life...
residential real estate.
He really doesn't hear it.
I wanna make Luke proud.
I wanna be his hero like my dad was
when he talked to my class
about running a grocery store.
He came in with two price guns in holsters
and marked our teacher at $1.29
before she knew what hit her.
I bet that produced a lot of laughs.
Claire, please.
And Olivia Berman's mom
works in the rare books department at the library.
Hope I get a chance to pick that brain.
Looks like you got quite the Career Day lineup.
So I guess they already got a closet guy coming in, huh?
No. I didn't think you'd wanna do it.
I don't, but you know, I just feel bad for the kids.
A lot of interesting stories in the closet biz.
Oh. Why have you never told us any?
Okay. Well, for example, there was this guy...
must have had over a hundred hats...
Yes?
And we had to fit them in the closet.
Okay?
And we did.
All right. Maybe it's not the most exciting career in the world,
but it pays the bills.
No one is complaining.
Were there other things I'd rather do? Yes.
But I had to make ends meet.
What other things?
Well, I always wanted to write thrillers.
Like that hat story?
Spy thrillers.
I've been kicking around this character,
CIA agent Chuck Stone, who doesn't care
how much his antics annoy the brass in Arlington.
Why didn't you ever try it?
I was busy with work and family.
I was gonna start writing after my divorce,
But you know... life got in the way.
Why do you point at me when you say "Life"?
Am I "Life"?
I meant you keep my busy.
You had a 3-hour nap on Sunday.
I was tired. From what?
Your 2-hour nap on Saturday?
Jay, I've been with you for five years,
and I've never heard you mention anything about writing.
Hey. I bought a typewriter.
A typewriter?
When is your book signing?
1975?
It's a hell of a character.
They taught him how to kill,
but he never learned to love!
No, no, no, no, no. Wait, wait. Okay.
Daddies! Daddies! The tooth fairy came.
What? No way!
Oh, that's so exciting!
What'd she bring you?
Oh! Fairy dust. Nice touch.
Oh, my gosh, it's a lot.
Some stickers...
A toothbrush...
And a hundred dollar bill!
What? Okay.
Look at that.
I love the tooth fairy.
The tooth fairy gave our daughter $100.
Does she not know that the going rate for a tooth is $5 at the most?
Well, obviously, the tooth fairy made a mistake.
Maybe it's 'cause the tooth fairy
had a little too much chardonnay last night.
I think the tooth fairy can handle the chardonnay.
What I don't think she can handle
is criticizing someone who made an honest mistake
in the dark of the night.
I'm gonna put this in my clutch.
I can't wait to tell everyone at school!
Okay, we cannot be the parents of a 6-year-old
who gets $100 from the tooth fairy.
It's bad enough we're the parents of a 6-year-old with a clutch.
You know, that bag transitions from day to night seamlessly,
and I no longer have to carry crayons in my front pocket.
Can't have this argument again!
Thank you, Dr. Ann,
for showing us how exciting and surprising
a real live therapy session can be.
I will hold on to this card.
Next up, we have Luke's dad, Mr. Dunphy.
Hey. Thank you.
Guess what?
I've been in your house when you weren't home.
And yours. And yours.
No, I'm not a burglar. I'm a realtor.
Ho! Hey, sorry I'm late!
I just sold another mansion.
How you doin', honey?
History is full of great rivalries--
Athens and Sparta, Kerrigan and Harding,
Phil Dunphy and Gil Thorpe.
In this scenario, he's the Tonya, I'm the Nancy.
Pay attention, kids.
You're about to hear from the number four realtor in town.
Anyway, uh, I'm not gonna bore you guys with a lecture.
Instead, I'd like you to watch
as I converse with a young man
who's wondering what to do with his life.
Hey, kid.
Hey, kid, up here! Up here!
Yo, dude! Whassup?
I'll tell you what's up.
I'm interested in helping you
by telling you all about a career in real estate.
Real estate? Isn't that just buying and selling houses?
I don't have time for that. Epic fail.
Sounds like we need to start at the beginning.
You see, real estate is about people.
People?
Couldn't agree more, Phil. Best part of our job
is putting the right person in the right home.
Gil...
Matter of fact, last week,
I put a "Spanish" Couple into
a Spanish home.
Gil.
A world without houses? That's cray cray.
Okay. Okay.
Phil, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to screw up your little show.
I know timing is critical on these things.
Gil, please.
Believe me, the last thing I want to do is...
You sold a house to the channel 7 weatherman?
No. No.
But I did sell one to Kobe Bryant.
What?! Guess what? He's not talking to you. He's talking to me.
And I have a very funny story, actually.
A guy walks into... No.
That's hilarious.
No! I haven't told it!
Okay, um... Oh!
Great throw. You were right.
It is in my court.
Ball's in your court!
But guess what-- it was me the whole time.
What?!
Come on, kids, come on.
Give it up! Give it up! He tried.
I think we all know what you were going for, Phil.
But I'm lookin' out here, and I'm seeing some hungry kids.
Am I right? That's why I brought plenty of...
Gil pickles!
Who wants a Gil pickle?
Come on. Let me see 'em.
All right. Come on. Grab one.
Gil pickles.
Genius.
So much better than my Phil-low cases.
Claire wasn't a fan.
One of him in bed is more than enough.
Do you hear that, ladies?
All right. Just hit "Send."
Hey! You just sold a house!
And you're gonna be chasing that high for the rest of your life.
Give her a round of applause, everybody.
She just sold a house.
I wanna thank you kids for having me here today.
And remember the three rules of real estate--
Thorpe, Thorpe, Thorpe!
Thank you, Mr. Thorpe.
It turns out we have a little extra time.
Uh, Mrs. Dunphy?
Yes?
I'm sure the class would love to hear from you.
Oh, no. I just came in to help my husband.
I'm a... I'm a stay-at-home mom.
I know. And that's a very important job.
It is. Uh, yeah.
I can--I can do this for a minute.
Um, stay-at-home mom.
Uh, what that means is I actually have
a whole bunch of different jobs.
I am a chauffeur, a chef,
Uh, a house manager,
A nurse.
Is it what you always wanted to do?
No. Not exactly.
Uh, I went to college, uh, to study marketing
and worked at one of those big hotel companies.
But when my kids came along,
I just wanted to be there.
You know, wipe their noses and change their diapers
And tuck 'em in at night.
Mom!
For the record, I do all my own wiping.
So why haven't you gone back to work?
I've done a few things lately. I just redid a house,
and I ran for city council last year.
You're on the city council?
No. I-I didn't win.
You lost?
That's what "Didn't win" means.
I... I thought I would be going back to work
when the kids got older,
But it--it's not as easy as you might think.
You know, people aren't exactly lining up
to hire a woman who's almost 40
and has been out of the job market for 15 years.
I thought you were 42.
That's almost 40, Luke.
My mom went back to work when I was 4.
Oh, so there was no one at home to teach you not to interrupt?
Okay. Hey, hey, hey!
Let me tell you something.
Stay-at-home moms are heroes.
Yeah.
They're the backbone of this country.
Thanks, Gil.
I mean, if I had to do that job,
I'd probably drink myself to death, honestly.
All right, let's give her a round of applause, everybody.
Come on.
Oh, come on, you can do better than that. Let me hear ya!
All right! All right!
All right, class dismissed. Get out of here!
No!
No, no, no.
We have... Guys, we have three more hours.
Here.
My old typewriter.
You said you want to write. Write.
Now? I've got a busy day.
I already called your office
And told them that you can't come in
to walk around for 20 minutes
saying to everyone, "What's up, sport?"
I know this is your subtle little way
of saying you don't think I can do it.
No. It's life getting out of the way.
Fine. I'm gonna take you up on your little challenge,
but you should know this--
this behavior of yours is not gonna fly
when you lose your looks.
You're gonna be long gone by then.
Dunphy.
Yeah? Oh.
You okay?
I'm fine. I'm fine.
Don't let that little smart-ass bother you, all right.
Have you seen her mother? Does not age well.
well, um, thanks for rescuing me in there.
And tell Phil I'm sorry
if I threw him off in there.
I probably should learn just to keep my big blowhole shut.
Actually, it went a little better than it did in rehearsal,
to be honest.
But I will tell him what you said.
All right.
You know, your little meltdown in there got me thinking.
I'm building a retail office development,
and I could use a liaison
to work with the planning commission.
Are you offering me a job?
Well, yeah. You know people in city hall,
and you did a hell of a job on that flip.
And for the safety of you and your family,
I gotta get you out of that house.
But you and Phil are competitors. It--
Not on this.
Look, if this works out, everybody's gonna win...
Except for that tropical fish store we're booting out of there.
I don't feel bad about that at all.
Can I take a couple of days to think about it?
Yeah. Yeah. Take your time. No pressure.
Okay.
And when you're ready, just give me a call.
Okay.
Number's on the stick.
Great. Oh, yeah. Okay. Gil pickle.
See ya! Thorpe! Thorpe! Thorpe!
Thorpe. Thorpe. Thorpe.
Look what just came in the mail--
A letter addressed to you, Lily.
Really? I don't get much mail.
Oh, let's see here.
Uh, yeah. Oh, the tooth fairy.
"1 Tooth Fairy Lane. Tooth City, Tooth Dakota."
I hope it's another $100.
Ooh! Well, lookie there.
Glitter!
I guess the tooth fairy doesn't have to worry about vacuuming.
See, "Dear Lily, I'm writing because I made a mistake"
"and gave you too much money."
"Please leave the $100 under your pillow tonight,"
"and I'll give you a dollar.
Sorry if that bites."
Let me see that.
I can't read.
Uh, well, it sounds like she's really in a jam.
And I think we're gonna
have to give the tooth fairy her $100 back.
No! I wanna keep it.
I'm scared that she's gonna be the one
taking care of us when we're older.
Yeah.
"Chuck Stone,"
"6-foot, 3-inches of steely eyed determination"
"sat at the interrogation table."
"His mind was a blank..."
"A complete blank.
"He literally could not think of one single, solitary thing.
"Then he noticed a spot."
"It looked like syrup left over from breakfast..."
"Which made him realize it was lunchtime."
"A bacon, lettuce, and tomato, sandwich--"
"Or B.L.T, as Chuck Stone called it--
"would really hit the spot."
"The secret, chuck realized, was real mayonnaise..."
"Not that healthy crap his wife kept buying for their son."
Damn it!
"I mean, what's the point of t-t-t-t-t-t-t?"
"Tea for two. Two for tea."
It only gets worse from here.
You can't be serious!
Gil Thorpe is my nemesis!
I hate to break it to you, Phil,
but you're not Batman.
Trust me.
Gil's a snake and he's found the perfect way to mess with me.
Did it ever occur to you that he was hiring me because of...
I don't know? Me.
Are you kidding? What's your last name?!
Right now?
I'm sorry, Claire.
I-I hate to do this, but I have to use my veto.
Veto? Oh, you don't get any vetoes.
You veto me all the time.
'Cause you have dumb ideas.
Name one.
That went on for a while.
...And let's not forget shower snacks.
I can't be the only one who gets hungry in there!
Hey, Jay. My mom said you were writing a book.
That's fantastic.
By the way, Career Day was a little weird.
I think Claire's going through some pretty dark stuff,
and you might want to check...
Enough chitchat.
I've gotta get a character out of a bind.
Ooh. What did he do?
He told his wife he could write a book.
Don't give up, Jay. Self-doubt is part of the process.
You can't be a good writer
without being critical of your own work.
What?
I'm racking my brain for a compliment here.
I know. It stinks.
And your mom's gonna rub it in my face pretty good.
Okay. Why is Chuck Stone interrogating this guy?
He needs the codes. If he doesn't get 'em,
the International Space Station's gonna
crash into Times Square on New Year's Eve.
So he's short of time.
He's got about two minutes. He's desperate.
How about this?
"Chuck Stone smiled and lit a cigarette,"
"as if he had all the time in the world,"
when in fact, the world was about to end."
Holy crap. What happens next?
Move over. I'll type.
Some coffee would be great. Thanks.
I'm sorry. I don't understand why
we don't just go in there,
we tell her we're taking the money, and that's that.
Because this is a teaching moment,
and we want her to want to give the money back.
I'm just really worried
we're becoming those overindulgent parents right now.
Don't be silly.
Okay, you ready, tooth fairy?
Let's do this.
All right.
Lily, look who came to say hi!
It's me, the tooth fairy.
And I've come to ask you for a favor!
Are you really the tooth fairy?
Oh, yes, I am. Look at my wings!
Can you fly? I wanna see you fly.
Well, I can't right now because...
Well, because--
Because the tooth fairy's too sad to fly...
Because she made a mistake that only you can make better.
Is this about the money again?
Well, yes, it is.
I need enough for all the other children's tooths.
Teeth.
Wait a minute.
You're not the tooth fairy. You're Haley.
No! I am the tooth fairy!
Look! Fairy dust!
And there's that glitter.
Why did you lie?
You said lying was wrong.
We also said that when someone is in trouble, you help them.
How do I know you weren't lying?
She is good.
All right, Lily, this is ridiculous.
All right, the tooth fairy has made a mistake.
You need to put the $100 under the pillow,
and that is the end of the story.
Because you believe it's the right thing to do...
Yes.
Don't you?
But I wanna buy a scooter.
Oh. That's what I'd do.
I mean...
Who cares what Santa thinks, right?
Santa?
Well, he sees everything,
And this'll probably put you on the "Naughty" list.
But who needs presents every year?
You've got a hundred dollars.
You can ride around that empty christmas tree
until you're an old lady.
Can I have some time to think about it?
You don't need any...
Of course, sweetie.
Yeah. Okay.
Haley? Okay, that was brilliant.
Thanks. Oh, also, can I borrow this?
Why?
I'd rather not say.
You know, after I put on the wig,
I just... I felt like the character.
Hang on.
Yell-o?
Quick question. Am I talking to live Phil or video Phil?
What do you want, Gil?
I just wanna make sure it's okay that your wife calls me "Boss."
Good-bye.
Oh, hold on! Hold on!
I'm just messing with ya.
Although I do think
your wife's gonna enjoy being under me.
My son is in the car.
Hey, superstar! What's up?
Listen, any time you wanna swing by the beach house,
I'll be glad to show you how to throw a tight spiral
like I did at Texas Tech. Booyah!
Tommy!
He already knows how to throw.
Yeah, my gay uncle Cam taught me.
I-I got this.
This was between us. You don't bring family into it.
Low blow getting Claire's hopes up.
Hey, I'm not getting her hopes up.
This is a real job with real bennies--
One of which is
I get to tell you what I'm thinking
whenever she leans over my desk!
Oh, I'm gonna have so much fun with this!
Later, Dunph-bags!
What a jerk.
You know what? We're gonna tell your mom
before she goes into business with this guy.
He's Gil-ty of being a Thorpe in my side.
Trying too hard.
Yeah.
Hello!
Move!
You're fine.
So?
How was your first day of writing?
Gloria, shh! Let me finish one thought.
Got it.
So you actually wrote something?
Well, it was slow going at first,
but then the juices started flowing.
May I?
Sure.
Uh, if it helps, picture Tom Berenger.
I always do.
What?
Well, it's just this...
This first sentence is a bit long.
Long or dynamic?
No, long and confusing. I can't tell who's talking.
Maybe that's just to mimic The Fog of Battle.
Okay.
What now?
Just... There were no cell phones in 1965.
That's a mistake. I'm changing that.
You can't change that. It comes back in the end...
I-I presume.
The point is, I can write.
I probably won't pursue it,
but it's a viable career option.
The CIA had all sorts of top-secret technology.
Who's to say they didn't have cell phones?
Manny, let it go.
And this Chuck Stone--
He doesn't seem very good at his job.
He's flawed. That's what makes the character interesting.
If you want someone perfect, put in a robot.
A robot!
I like a robot.
No! You're not putting a robot in my story!
That's right, my story.
You must be very happy.
I would be, but life got in the way.
What are you doing?
Oh, I just got out my old briefcase.
It's still capable of doing the job,
Just like me.
Claire, you have to understand something.
You have to understand something.
I walked around all day on cloud nine
because somebody valued me.
I value you. We all value you.
No, of course you do,
Because I cook and I clean and I pick up dirty underwear.
No, honey, it's different than that.
I have been on the sidelines for so long,
I didn't know if anybody would ever think
I have what it takes again.
I know Gil's not the greatest guy,
But this is important. And I think--
I think you should take the job.
But, dad...
No, Luke. She's right.
Your mom's gonna be amazing at this.
I retract my veto.
You never had a veto.
Yes, I did.
No, you didn't, and I'll tell you why.
And that went on for a while.
...And lastly, this whole conversation would be happening
in a yurt.
It's the perfect structure.
I have to go take the shoulder pads out of all my old suits!
You know he's gonna keep teasing you.
If it makes your mom happy, I can handle a few phone calls.
And texts.
What does it say?
Nothing I can't handle.
"We all weave a web of lies."
"Some we tell to try to help the ones we love."
"Some we tell to try to fool ourselves."
"And some we tell because,
when you're out of bullets
and staring down the barrel of a kalashnikov,
the only weapon you've got left is guile."
She's nuts. That's fantastic.
Okay, guys, bring it in!
Let's get this place shipshape before she gets home.
I'm sure she had a big first day.
Haley, I'm putting you on laundry.
Alex, kitchen and vacuum.
Luke, you're cleaning the bathroom.
Why me?
Because you always mess it up.
Yeah, why can't you pee straight?
Hey, I'm doing a great job from that far back.
Okay, guys, team Dunphy on three.
One, two--that's right, we got a lot to do!
Honey, what are you doing home so early?
I quit. That man is a complete pig.
He treated me like a servant
and showed me absolutely no respect.
I'm so sorry. You deserve better than that.
I do.
So what's for dinner?
I feel like you heard me wrong. I said, what's for dinner?
I heard you!
