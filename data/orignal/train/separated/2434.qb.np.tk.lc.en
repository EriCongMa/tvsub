damon !
don &apos;t leave me .
in order for me to save myself and leave you ,
i had to shut off my humanity , damn it ,
no regret .
we &apos;re even , enzo .
do you know the reason we &apos;re together ?
because klaus granted us permission to be together .
you promise to walk away and never come back .
then , yes , i will be honest with you about what i want .
i will walk away , and i &apos;ll never come back .
a vampire killed my parents .
maybe that was you .
it was all me .
i &apos;m bad , elena , i am bad for you ,
and i &apos;m choosing to let you go .
when i get elena back
just remember you-- you &apos;re the one
that pep talked me out of doing the right thing
for the universe and all mankind .
you are a traveler .
you have the ability to keep living inside someone else &apos;s body .
we just need to find one who can teach you
how to do the passenger spell .
jaryakat a zem . daryeet acza .
talk to me . did it work ?
of course it worked .
i &apos;m katherine pierce .
i survive .
guess who !
hmm . i wonder . elena gilbert ?
yep !
you &apos;re in a good mood .
well , it &apos;s a good day .
we &apos;re alive .
yes , we are , and we are partying tonight .
yes , we are .
so what did you want to talk to me about ?
are you still drinking vervain ?
no . i wear this bracelet
in case anyone needs my blood , remember ?
this is gonna hurt me more than it hurts you .
what are you doing ? i need that .
long story short-- i &apos;m katherine , not elena .
katherine &apos;s dead .
not exactly .
while you guys were all playing drinking games ,
toasting to what a horrible person i am ,
i was plotting a way to passenger myself
into elena &apos;s cute , little head .
oh , my god .
anyway , i need a crash course
on all things elena gilbert .
she &apos;s in college now , all grown up ,
and i figured who knows her better
than her compellable best friend ?
so what do you think ? how &apos;s my dress ?
it screams safe and predictable .
am i right , or am i right ?
i &apos;m not doing this .
just compel him already .
take the fun right out of it , why don &apos;t you ?
play along with my secret , matty pants .
would elena wear this outfit to a party ?
no to the dress , yes to the shoes .
now let &apos;s talk honestly
about the red thing that &apos;s happening in my hair .
so you &apos;re dead and , what , hitching a ride in her brain ?
for now .
until i make it permanent .
permanent ? how ?
hello ! the hair . why did she dye it ?
i don &apos;t know . she did it in new york
right after she shut her humanity off .
but her humanity &apos;s back now . perfect .
it &apos;s gone .
ok . what &apos;s jeremy &apos;s birthday ?
october 13 .
when &apos;s elena &apos;s birthday ?
june 22 .
what &apos;s my address ?
2104 maple street ,
but you burnt your house down .
i know . that was a trick question .
good job !
who do i like better--
bonnie or caroline ?
please say caroline .
you love them both equally .
well , that &apos;s a shocker .
i just have one last question .
it &apos;s very important because i &apos;m going to need it later .
how exactly did elena gilbert break up with you ?
mia said she needs your corpse .
my corpse ?
could travelers be any creepier ?
be nice .
without mia , you wouldn &apos;t be alive
or inside elena &apos;s body right now .
i know . i &apos;d be dead in my corpse ,
a corpse that some traveler says that they need .
you see how that &apos;s creepy ?
do you want to be in control of elena &apos;s body or not ?
look . i get it , ok ?
we have no idea when elena &apos;s consciousness is gonna pop out .
now you want to tell me what you &apos;re doing over there ?
get on the bed .
just in case elena decides to show up
while i &apos;m out getting your body .
so i &apos;m just gonna be stuck in a hotel room , bound to a bed while
damon salvatore &apos;s leaving me voicemails ?
remind me again how this is better than being dead .
because once mia does her spell ,
elena will be gone forever ,
and this body will be yours for good .
where you been ?
just out .
define out .
one who hovers and sticks his nose in other people &apos;s business .
oh . i &apos;m sorry . i was defining annoying .
that &apos;s funny .
katherine &apos;s rotting corpse was stinking up the house .
i got rid of it .
could be a bit of a problem .
oh ? and why is that ?
because i &apos;m here for katherine &apos;s body .
you &apos;re out of luck .
you ain &apos;t getting it .
my mother asked to be buried with her family in bulgaria .
and nothing gives me greater joy than to deny her dying wish .
damon , who cares ? katherine &apos;s dead .
just give her the damn body .
bitch ruined our lives .
nadia &apos;s known her , what , 5 minutes ?
tell me where she is .
the nicest thing that katherine pierce will ever do
is feeding the maggots that feast on her flesh .
give it up . you &apos;re not getting her back .
have you seen my phone ?
ty !
have you seen my phone ?
i &apos;m late for work , dude .
look at you , captain responsible .
here . join me for breakfast .
no . you know , i &apos;m good , seeing it &apos;s , uh , 7 : 42 .
aye , aye , captain .
ok . so you gonna tell me what happened in new orleans ?
well , there were witches ,
gumbo , a few originals .
look . it doesn &apos;t matter because it &apos;s over , in the past .
no more drama .
i &apos;m starting fresh .
ok , then . we &apos;re celebrating .
i &apos;m throwing you a welcome back party .
wait . what ?
no .
yeah . so clean this place up
and invite some people
and , uh , shower
because you stink .
it &apos;s open !
are you cleaning the fireplace ?
yeah .
well , you know ,
all those carcinogens .
i &apos;m stress cleaning . i &apos;m stressed , so i &apos;m cleaning .
boy drama .
not that you care .
i &apos;m here for elena , but clearly she &apos;s not here .
i &apos;ll--i &apos;ll come back later .
well , i can give her a message .
uh , yeah , can you just tell her
that wes isn &apos;t gonna be a problem anymore ?
i mean , my family &apos;s trust came through ,
and i was able to cut off augustine &apos;s funding .
so no more vampire experiments ?
yeah , that &apos;s over .
and can you just tell her that i &apos;m sorry ,
i &apos;m really sorry for everything ?
i will .
ok .
aaron whitmore . just the man i &apos;ve been looking for .
enzo .
hey . i need a favor .
you know how damon as trying to be all noble
and broke up with elena ?
of course . there was champagne .
yeah . well , i kind of convinced him he was an idiot .
you what ? !
and now he &apos;s in a bit of a mood ,
and something tells me
that he &apos;s been trying to get ahold of elena ,
but she hasn &apos;t been returning his phone calls .
look . i would love to help
if i thought he was actually good for her ,
but i don &apos;t .
caroline , how would you liked to be judged
solely based on who you &apos;re attracted to ?
come on .
why ? do you know something ?
why ? should i know something .
i just mean are you sure that this is
what you really want , you know ,
elena and damon or damon and elena ,
or--i know that there &apos;s a nickname in there somewhere .
listen . i actually think that elena is good for damon .
she makes him happy , and we all know that when damon is happy ...
he &apos;s not out there killing people ,
which i guess is a plus for mankind .
exactly .
but even if i wanted to help ,
she &apos;s not here .
i thought that she was with you .
she was told me she was staying at whitmore .
ok . that &apos;s weird .
well , where the hell is she ?
does that thing ever shut up ?
where am i ?
what &apos;s going on ?
oh , my god .
katherine .
hello , elena .
you ! you put katherine inside of me
instead of you .
what happened ?
elena gilbert happened .
wonderful . she &apos;s fighting .
it &apos;s only a matter of time before she comes out again .
did you get my body ?
oh , come on . katherine is exactly where she &apos;s always belonged .
i &apos;m not giving the body back .
quit giving me that damn pouty face .
i &apos;m not giving you the pouty face .
this is my &quot; you &apos;re being a dick &quot; face .
elena hasn &apos;t called you back .
it &apos;s making you completely miserable .
yeah . i &apos;m completely miserable .
it &apos;s your fault , telling me to get her back .
no . you &apos;re miserable because you did what you always do .
you had a problem , and instead of dealing with it ,
you cut ties and you ran .
you &apos;re enjoying this a little too much .
ok . so bonnie took jeremy to go visit her mom ,
and neither of them have talked to elena .
who invited you ? scram .
i invited her .
caroline agreed to help you get elena back .
you ?
you hate me .
you once told me that calling me satan was an insult to satan .
well ... nobody &apos;s perfect .
this is what it &apos;s come to ?
you brought me love advice from prudy trudy .
i can be unpredictable and incredibly reckless .
what &apos;s going on here ?
are you guys baby @-@ sitting me ?
we &apos;re just hanging out , chatting .
i don &apos;t need this , and i don &apos;t need your help .
well , i guess you better try elena again .
seriously , i have never met a group of needier people .
it &apos;s not bad enough that damon &apos;s trying to win me back .
i &apos;m also getting &quot; where are you ? &quot;
&quot; i &apos;m worried about you . &quot;
&quot; call me . &quot;
&quot; are you going to tyler &apos;s party ? &quot;
it &apos;s a wonder that this thing still has a battery .
they &apos;re getting suspicious .
yeah .
we need to find your body .
stefan texted and asked if i was going to tyler &apos;s party .
maybe i do go , convince everyone that elena is alive and well ,
and i casually ask him where damon buried me .
no . no way .
you said it yourself .
it &apos;s just a matter of time until elena shows up again .
so then come with me .
shove her back in if that happens .
this is not the right place for your to be , around all her friends .
i &apos;ve impersonated elena a million times .
i can mimic everything about her .
this is different .
you &apos;re not impersonating elena .
you are elena .
when is her birthday ?
what grade did her and caroline meet ?
where did she kiss stefan for the first time ?
ok , ok . i get your point .
i &apos;m gonna have to brush up on a few fun facts ,
and i know exactly who can help us .
you know , you still own my house .
yeah , legally . it &apos;s not like i pay the bills .
yeah , but it means you &apos;ll have to invite certain people in tonight ,
people like elena , stefan .
that your lame way of asking if invited caroline ?
pretty much .
yeah , she &apos;s coming .
so when you say you &apos;re starting over ,
you &apos;re basically saying you want caroline back .
just get the cups , ok ?
elena , hey .
hi , matty !
matty ?
matt . i mean , matt ,
i was , um , hoping that you could help me with something .
guess who !
hmm . i wonder .
enzo .
hello , damon .
ahh . we have a bit of business to attend to .
missed a spot .
ooh ! oh . i love a good fire .
oh ! that &apos;s ironic , isn &apos;t it ,
you know , since you left me to burn alive in one ?
didn &apos;t we already do this ?
you tried to make me feel guilty ,
i saved your life , we &apos;re even .
what &apos;s in the bag ?
more like who .
ah . since you and i last spoke ,
i &apos;ve done a bit of soul @-@ searching ,
had a trip to the barber , and did a little research ,
which revealed to me that you killed
almost every member of the whitmore family
in the years since your escape ,
leaving just one alive each time to carry on the family name ,
producing a whole new generation of victims for you to slaughter
exactly as you said you &apos;d do
back when you and i were cellmates .
well , you know me .
i like to keep my promises .
and it &apos;s occurred to me that perhaps
i wrote you off too quickly ,
that , in fact , the damon salvatore i remember is alive and well ,
and i have a present for him .
you brought me aaron whitmore ...
alive .
he &apos;s the last of the whitmore clan .
you remember this vervain wristwatch ?
dr. whitmore never took it off ,
even when he was rooting around in our chest cavities .
fitting aaron should die wearing it , too .
so ... do you want to kill him , or shall i ?
ergh . you &apos;ve got to be kidding me .
matt ! heh !
elena , hey . come in .
thank you .
well , that wasn &apos;t awkward at all .
right . sorry about that .
it &apos;s ok . go find some blond to hit on .
all right . i &apos;m gonna go make the rounds .
you need anything ?
i &apos;m good , thanks .
elena , you &apos;re alive .
of course i &apos;m alive .
wow ! stefan salvatore is drinking beer out of a cup .
do you want me to show you where tyler keeps the bourbon ?
no . i &apos;m trying to stay off the hard stuff .
hey . so ...
where have you been ?
caroline was about to send out a search party for you .
around , thinking , processing ,
trying to figure out how to deal with this whole damon thing .
hmm . you know he made a mistake , right ?
he wants you back .
yeah , i know .
hang on . isn &apos;t this a little weird for you ?
it &apos;s incredibly weird ,
but , uh , i know my brother ,
and i know he &apos;s a better person with you than without you .
so how are you ?
how are you dealing with the whole katherine dying thing ?
i &apos;m ok .
stefan , you don &apos;t have to hide your feelings .
no . honestly , i &apos;m ok .
you know , we had a thing ,
it ended , and she died , and i &apos;m fine .
you knew her for , like , 150 years .
you &apos;re not even a little heartbroken ?
i mean , even i feel a little bad .
you know , maybe we should give her , like , a funeral or something .
a funeral ?
where &apos;s she buried ?
i should at least drop off flowers or something .
i have no idea . damon said he put her
where she was always meant to be .
classic damon .
as much as i &apos;ve enjoyed your quality bourbon ,
i feel confident our next drink will taste better
with the sound of young aaron &apos;s dying screams ringing in our ears
and the knowledge that your final act of revenge
will have brought us both closure and a new beginning .
i &apos;m just curious . do you ask all of your friends
to prove their loyalty by killing someone over drinks ?
his grandfather slit our eyes open with a scalpel .
you &apos;ve taken out everyone else in the whitmore family .
i thought you &apos;d want this .
would you believe he &apos;s a friend of a friend ?
no , because that would force me to believe that you &apos;ve gone soft
when you and i both know that your very first impulse
when i presented him to you was to rip out his throat .
surely my old friend &apos;s still in there someplace .
end this for both of us .
really bad timing , blondie .
i &apos;m dealing with a blast from the past .
then deal with it quickly and get your ass over to tyler &apos;s .
elena &apos;s here .
looks like he &apos;s coming round .
it &apos;s time to make a decision , damon .
do you want to kill him , or shall i ?
i hate deadlines .
well , i didn &apos;t see that one coming .
i can &apos;t kill you . long story .
because elena would hate you for it .
that &apos;s why you can &apos;t kill me .
go back to college and pack up your entire life .
there &apos;s one highway that heads out of town .
take it north till you hit ice .
don &apos;t ever come back .
how domestic of you .
apparently elena would do this sort of stuff .
i &apos;m actually starting to feel sorry for her .
did you find out where your body is or not ?
stefan said damon put me somewhere i was always meant to be .
a riddle .
for 145 years , damon thought i was in a tomb
underneath the old church ,
and , boy , was he disappointed when i wasn &apos;t there .
well , let &apos;s hope you are this time .
right .
now say your good @-@ byes .
we can &apos;t have anyone following us .
there you are ! i &apos;ve been calling and texting .
sorry . my phone died .
um , what did you want to talk about ?
i did a bad thing .
i &apos;m sure it wasn &apos;t that bad .
you don &apos;t even know what it is .
elena , stop .
this is really important .
ok . i &apos;m sorry . tell me . what happened ?
what would you say if i told you that
when a certain awful person was in town
i ran into him in the woods and sort of kissed him ?
he was there , and he obviously wanted to kiss me ,
so i thought , &quot; oh ! we &apos;ll just make out , &quot;
but then it felt really good to kiss him ,
so then i kind of totally had sex with him ,
but i swear i didn &apos;t plan to do it ,
and now i feel terrible .
and the person we &apos;re talking about is ...
klaus .
oh , wow ! that--that--
wow ! really ?
would i make something like this up ?
and that is why i need you to tell me
what an awful person i am .
actually , you &apos;re one of the least awful people i know .
so tell me . how was it ,
you know , compared to tyler ?
elena gilbert !
caroline forbes ! come on . spill the beans .
i am ...
now that you &apos;ve slept with klaus ,
i mean , how was it ?
i am so not answering that .
oh , you so are .
oh , my god .
took you long enough .
i was pretending to care .
it was very time @-@ consuming .
let &apos;s get it over with .
in order to seal katherine &apos;s spirit inside elena &apos;s body ,
i &apos;ll need some of your blood .
then ...
you mutilate my body . lovely .
travelers don &apos;t have access to traditional magic , so we improvise .
now shut up .
i have to concentrate .
so , um , what &apos;s happening now ?
katherine , if you want to say good @-@ bye to elena forever ,
i need silence .
are you ok ?
save your daughterly concern . i &apos;m fine .
get out .
just let me explain .
no . let me .
klaus killed thousands of people--
elena &apos;s aunt ,
an entire pack of hybrids , my friends .
caroline ...
he killed my mom !
i know , i know .
i am so sorry .
just stop .
i walked out last time . now it &apos;s your turn .
go .
no .
don &apos;t take another step , caroline .
if you would just-
i said leave !
you &apos;re drunk .
get your hands off me .
what &apos;s the matter with you ?
oh , you don &apos;t know ?
she screwed klaus .
exactly .
you know , drunk or not , she doesn &apos;t deserve that .
you never told me where you wanted to go .
where i wanted to go ?
once we complete the spell .
where should we start our world tour ?
let me finish . just a few more seconds , and then i &apos;m done .
elena .
what was that ?
i couldn &apos;t quite hear you .
donovan , you in here ?
mia .
mia .
are you ok ?
just finish the spell .
what ?
no . no , no , no .
you &apos;ve got to be kidding me .
oh , my god . no , no , no .
katerina , may i introduce to you the lord niklaus .
call me klaus .
come on . kiss me , damon , or kill me .
katherine , get out of my head !
i will love you forever .
or at least a very long time .
no !
i fooled one of you .
no ! no !
damon !
damon , thank god .
what &apos;s wrong ?
it &apos;s done .
you &apos;re ok .
say something , please .
i &apos;ve been looking everywhere for you .
we need to talk .
yeah , i want to talk , too .
the message thingies on your phone , that &apos;s all me
in case you deleted them and didn &apos;t listen to them .
i listened to every word .
then you know how bad i screwed up .
i wussed out , elena . i bailed because
i was convinced i &apos;d ruin you .
that &apos;s not what this is about , damon .
no . i know . just hear me out ,
just hear me out .
you are literally the best person i &apos;ve ever known ,
and for me to think that i could change you
gives me way too much credit
and you not nearly enough .
you are the best influence on me .
i need you .
you are the good ,
and i need a little good in my life ...
because without it ,
there &apos;s an awful lot of darkness .
that &apos;s a lot of pressure , damon .
i know , elena .
no . no . it &apos;s my turn now .
yeah . ok .
i love that i make you a better person ,
i love that i make you happy ,
but i don &apos;t want to be the only thing that you live for .
i don &apos;t want to worry about what &apos;s gonna happen
every time we get into a fight
or if we break up again
or who you &apos;re gonna take it out on .
what--what are you talking about ?
i know what you did to katherine , damon .
she was weak and dying ,
and you still tortured her .
how is this about katherine ?
it &apos;s not , ok ? it &apos;s about you .
it &apos;s about you ,
about the person that i can &apos;t change ,
and the person that you really are .
that person was right to let me go .
i &apos;m sorry , damon , but it &apos;s over .
we &apos;re over .
damon .
come on .
deep down , you got to be enjoying this a little bit .
you know what i realized tonight ?
this is a big @-@ ass house .
i live in a fricking mansion .
my parents are dead ,
the girl i love slept with my nemesis ,
and i have absolutely no idea
what i &apos;m gonna do with the rest of my life ,
which--get this-- lasts forever ...
but i got a big @-@ ass house .
why don &apos;t we get out of it for a while , you know ,
just go somewhere , be anywhere but here ?
klaus put me through hell in new orleans , matt .
he crushed me .
and just when i thought it was over ,
that he couldn &apos;t destroy anything else
or do anything worse ...
so that &apos;s it ? it worked ?
try not to sound so impressed ,
but , yes , katherine pierce
has permanent control of elena gilbert &apos;s body .
now about that payment we discussed .
was that necessary ?
no , but she was a loose end ,
and i hate that .
she gave me the creeps anyway .
cold , manipulative , good hair .
you really are my daughter .
if that &apos;s your way of thanking me ,
save it for the road .
i &apos;m not going anywhere .
for the first time in the last 500 years , i &apos;m in the clear .
there &apos;s no one coming after me .
hell , half the people in this town
would probably slit their own throats to protect elena gilbert .
and what about me ?
you &apos;re a grown woman .
you can make your own decisions ,
but if you want my vote ...
stay .
now i &apos;m not saying that i &apos;ll ever learn how to be a good mother ,
but i &apos;ll try .
i &apos;ve got all the time in the world to get it right .
i &apos;ve searched for you for centuries .
i &apos;m not leaving now , but we both know
you want more than just mother @-@ daughter bonding time .
you &apos;re right . i want it all .
i want my daughter , i want immortality ,
and i want stefan salvatore .
he &apos;s my one true love .
well ...
i &apos;d hate to be the person standing in your way .
there you are .
i &apos;ve been looking all over for you .
yeah . well , i couldn &apos;t find a rock big enough to crawl under .
you &apos;re my friend .
i need you to just give it to me straight .
am i a horrible person ?
so that &apos;s why you came here , huh ?
all right .
let me ask you something .
when you found out about me and katherine ,
what was your first thought ?
honestly , i thought , &quot; eww . &quot;
see ? and if you held that against me ,
you wouldn &apos;t be sitting here right now with me , would you ?
or maybe i came here because
i know that you see the best in people .
all right . somebody has to say it ,
so here goes .
you ready ?
caroline ...
you are a horrible person , ok ?
you are--you are thoughtless ,
you &apos;re shallow , you &apos;re completely undependable--
hey . i am--i am vulnerable . don &apos;t be mean .
you know what ? now that i think about it ,
i have no idea what klaus saw in you .
what was he thinking ?
shut up !
hey . you all right ?
you all right , man ?
never better .
we &apos;ve been waiting for you .
damon &apos;s teaching me a little game .
see , he assured me you &apos;d be on this road heading out of town .
you said that you were gonna let me go .
i did . i tried .
does elena know that you &apos;re here ?
she &apos;s the reason i &apos;m here .
no . scratch that .
i &apos;m the reason i &apos;m here .
what do you want , damon ?
i want the same thing you want , aaron--
go back in time , fix the past ,
get someone back i &apos;ve lost .
everyone that i lost is because of you .
you know who murdered my entire family ?
you !
justifiably .
either way , i did it .
i tore them apart ,
i liked the sounds they made
because i realized they deserved it like you .
elena was too good for you .
i used to think that . yeah .
that i had to be better to deserve her love
and she had to be worse to accept mine .
i &apos;d lie in the middle of the road ,
looking up at the stars ,
having conversations with people like you ,
trying to convince myself that killing them was a bad instinct
and that sparing their lives was the right thing to do .
so what &apos;d you do ? did you kill them ?
it doesn &apos;t matter .
the point is i was conflicted .
right now in this very , very moment ,
i am crystal clear .
see , elena thinks i &apos;m a monster .
you know what ?
she &apos;s right .
now that &apos;s the damon salvatore i remember .
