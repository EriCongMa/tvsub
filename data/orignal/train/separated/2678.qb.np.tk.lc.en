john gotti , life in prison ...
... no chance of parole .
we &apos;ve seen prosecutions in florida and elsewhere of top mob figures .
what are you doing ? put that back .
what &apos;s the situation on the ground today , right now , in the mob ?
confusion , instability , vacuum at the top .
what caused the decline ? -your sister &apos;s ass .
an aggressive government policy over two decades ...
to behead the crime families .
but wasn &apos;t it , at least in part ...
... a disregard within the mob itself ...
... of the rules that served the old dons so well ?
if the shoe fits .
no doubt .
sil . cheer me up , babe .
just when i thought i was out , they pull me back in .
is that pacino or is that pacino ? spitting image .
vincent rizzo .
yes .
former soldier in the genovese family .
government witness turned best @-@ selling author .
do you agree with u.s. attorney braun ?
the party &apos;s over .
he is a wiseguy . elaborate . -it &apos;s not like it was .
cloning .
mexicans are huge in that .
fascinating .
because they work as parking valets .
do i mean that organized crime ...
... will go the way of the dodo bird ?
what the fuck are you talking about ?
mexicans .
what about them ?
cell phones .
i &apos;m not talking about cloning cell phones .
i &apos;m talking about fucking sheep ! science .
i tell my kids , &quot; only god can make a life . &quot;
a guy here asks , &quot; what if they had cloned princess di ? &quot;
but you know , the heydey ? you know , the golden age ... or whatever , of the mob ?
that &apos;s gone .
and that &apos;s never coming back .
they have only themselves to blame .
they pay this chiacchierone by the word ?
drug trafficking .
i think it ruined everything .
you &apos;re looking at a mandatory 35 to life in prison .
guys started to rat so they could avoid prosecution .
what &apos;s going on with that princess di ?
do you think the royal family had her whacked ?
last time i take a limo in paris .
like you were ever in paris .
i went for a blowjob .
your mother was working the bonbon concession at the eiffel tower .
you hear what i told him ? &quot; i went over for a blowjob .
your mother was working at the eiffel tower . &quot;
i got a list of people i wouldn &apos;t want cloned .
the mayor of new york , that &apos;s the guy least likely to get cloned .
so the code of silence , the omertà , or whatever , just went by the boards .
you &apos;re always gonna have organized crime . always .
as long as the human being has certain appetites
... someone &apos;s always gonna surface to serve these needs . always .
just when i thought i was out , they pull me back in .
you got dvd players ?
don &apos;t hurt me .
only people who get hurt are the jerk @-@ offs .
now step down , nice and easy .
he &apos;s got the dvd players .
quick and painless . don &apos;t wanna hurt you .
you gotta tie me up .
you gonna be a jerk @-@ off ?
my boss &apos;ll think i &apos;m in on it .
we look like we want a merit badge ? we travel with rope ?
i &apos;ve got some in the cab . please , i need this job .
okay , get the rope .
i don &apos;t know who gave the route , but there &apos;s no way i &apos;d go unscathed ...
without being fired .
you want to be scathed ?
so it looks like i didn &apos;t give up without a struggle .
that &apos;s cool . thank you .
that &apos;s enough .
no , wait .
that &apos;s good !
scathed ?
scathed .
he &apos;s scathed .
mr. miller , my science teacher , he got his car stolen .
you &apos;re kidding . from where ? his house ?
his parking spot at school .
a saturn . he only had it a year .
the security people are a joke .
did you hear what a.j. just said ? mr. miller &apos;s car got stolen .
refresh my memory . who is he ?
he &apos;s your son &apos;s science teacher .
you &apos;re up early .
he just bought that car a year ago .
so ? insurance will pay .
they don &apos;t give full value .
these poor teachers , they don &apos;t make a lot .
so he can work his summer vacation .
you could help find it .
i thought i told you i changed my name from lojack to soprano .
laugh . i &apos;d pee in my pants . pussy &apos;s got the body shop . he couldn &apos;t ask ?
i &apos;m late .
what are you getting in science ?
d @-@ plus .
see what i can do .
that &apos;s not what i meant .
he &apos;s gotta work for his grades .
i &apos;m going back to bed .
bye , dad .
see you later .
here , eat this .
technology comes to the bing !
hey , where you been ?
come on .
let &apos;s go .
hey , is the load here ?
yeah .
if serge calls , i &apos;ll be back .
these new phones , hold , conference , sometimes i get confused .
how complicated is it ? answer the phone , take the message .
voice mail only comes on if you let it ring .
jesus christ , georgie .
i hear there &apos;s not as many titles as on laser .
there &apos;s more coming .
my internist said the picture &apos;s not that different .
but the sound , way improved .
good . nothing beats popping up some corn and listening to men in black .
fuck it !
it &apos;s the damn wires , that &apos;s all !
i &apos;ll hook it up . i used to be an installer .
why can &apos;t you be nice to brendan ?
we discussed that .
i was gonna come looking . it &apos;s the guy .
it &apos;s serge ?
i &apos;ll take it over there .
serge ?
press &quot; hold &quot; when you transfer a call .
i &apos;m sorry , tony .
now he &apos;s not gonna call back .
brendan &apos;s a good earner , t. this jack was his plan .
he &apos;s a good kid , but i don &apos;t like meth .
fuck , i gotta call my mother .
hello ?
hello , ma ?
oh , look who calls .
how you doing ?
i was wondering when you &apos;d call .
you can stop wondering now . this is it , i &apos;m calling you .
i called yesterday . you were supposed to call me back .
i phoned your house .
some operator answered . i couldn &apos;t understand a word she was saying .
that &apos;s not an operator , that &apos;s an answering machine .
oh , fancy , fancy .
here , let me turn the heat off under these mushrooms .
you and mom are like peas in a pod .
she can &apos;t master the phone , but she &apos;s 70 .
what is she doing now ?
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
ma !
ma !
hey , ma !
oh , my god !
ma !
where is she ?
who is this ?
it &apos;s anthony !
the mushrooms , they &apos;re on fire !
get the fire extinguisher under the sink !
oh , my god ! the wall &apos;s getting all black !
ma , hang up and call 911 .
the guy &apos;s on the second line .
aren &apos;t you coming over ?
you press &quot; hold , &quot; god damn it .
i can &apos;t , i &apos;m 40 minutes away .
you hang up and you call 911 . leave the house .
look at how i live !
ma , hang up and call 911 .
hello ?
my mother &apos;s got a fire in the kitchen .
oh , my god .
she &apos;s calling 911 . get over there .
i &apos;m on my way .
thank you , baby . i know you &apos;re busy .
serge , serge .
i can &apos;t talk now .
i gotta go to an outside line . give me your number .
all right . i &apos;ll call you back .
is your mom okay ?
shit cannot go on like this .
hey , t. hey , t.
this teacher , his car , you got a plate number ?
call my wife .
have a nice day .
thanks .
no problem .
ma , i wish you &apos;d let me get somebody to help you .
you shouldn &apos;t be alone .
help me what ?
with the housework .
i have my ways .
a stranger could care less about doing it right .
can i tell you something though , ma ? you need company .
don &apos;t start with that nursing @-@ home business again .
this is not a nursing home . it is a retirement community .
you want me to make you pastina ? something in your stomach ?
ma , now , i &apos;ve told tony
and i &apos;ve told you many times .
you can come live with us .
i know when i &apos;m not wanted !
i invited you to share my home .
if you want me to beg , that &apos;s different .
leave this place that my husband and i shared ?
well , change can be a positive .
he was a saint .
that son of mine , is he still having those fits ?
they &apos;re not fits , ma . they &apos;re anxiety attacks .
you know , he &apos;s on medication .
what bmw &apos;s charging us for paint ?
it &apos;s been that way for six months .
when was i last here ?
we maybe caught a break .
watchung avenue said some guys brought a saturn ...
trying to load it for parts .
are you saying this car &apos;s for tony and leave it all in one piece ?
yeah , sure . it &apos;s for the kid &apos;s teacher .
my guy said one of those goofballs had a uniform on from buttfucks .
whatever , the coffee shop . i guess the guy works there .
watchung and what ?
i &apos;m fucking rockford here .
decaf cappuccino primo , non @-@ fat magnifico , double espresso regulare .
i &apos;ll take you here .
i think i &apos;ll have an espresso . paul , you want anything ?
they got any just coffee ?
our café du jour is new zealand peaberry .
whatever .
that &apos;s $ 4.20 . pick it up there .
one medium du jour , one single espresso .
here , keep it .
honey , let me ask you .
my wife was in the body shop around the corner the other day .
the guy in front of her leaves and she sees he dropped his money clip
but he was already gone . we &apos;d like to give it back .
she said he was wearing a uniform like that there .
real black hair . tall ? little earring .
these stores are everywhere .
yeah , tell me about it .
fucking italian people . how &apos;d we miss out on this ?
what ?
fucking espresso , cappuccino .
we invent it and these cocksuckers are getting rich .
isn &apos;t it amazing ?
it &apos;s not just money . it &apos;s a pride thing .
all our food , pizza , calzone , buffalo mozzarella olive oil
these fucks had nothing .
they ate puzzi before we gave them our cuisine .
but this , this is the worst . this espresso shit .
take it easy .
she finally agreed to have somebody come in days .
carmela called an agency ,
and they sent over this trinidadian woman .
but no matter what i do , i feel guilty .
why ?
the real reason is , i can &apos;t let her live with us .
that doesn &apos;t seem practical , given her personality .
well , it &apos;s my wife . she won &apos;t allow it .
where are your sisters in this ?
they cut it off with her long ago . no way she &apos;s bunking with them .
so you &apos;re carrying all this guilt when your mother is clearly someone
who has difficulty maintaining any relationship .
but she &apos;s my mother .
you &apos;re supposed to take care of your mother . she &apos;s a little old lady .
not to you .
she &apos;s very powerful .
bullshit .
you accord this &quot; little old lady ... &quot;
an almost mystical ability to wreak havoc .
let me tell you . you definitely don &apos;t want to get her started .
there are some people who are not ideal candidates for parenthood .
come on . she &apos;s an old sweetie @-@ pie .
what were some of the good experiences you remember as a child ?
the loving warm ones ?
one time we were down at the shore .
about &apos; 68 , &apos; 69 , the whole family .
my father , he tripped and fell down the stairs , and we were all laughing .
the whole family was laughing . my mother was laughing .
any other loving experiences ?
hey , she &apos;s a good woman .
she put food on the table every night .
i &apos;m the ungrateful fuck . i come here , complain about her ...
and i let my wife exclude her from my home .
hey , ma !
you perrilyn ?
yes .
tony soprano .
how you doing ?
i &apos;m fine .
oh , livia , your son is here ! and isn &apos;t he a handsome thing .
and look what he brought .
all right , listen . let &apos;s get one thing straight .
in the hours you &apos;re here taking care of my mother , no ganja . okay ?
hey , ma , fiori .
i &apos;m not dead , unfortunately for some .
the tall ones are delphiniums .
you know , frankie valli when he visits jersey ?
this is the florist he uses .
aren &apos;t they beautiful ?
want me to put them on the table ?
you make sure the bottom of the vase isn &apos;t wet .
mr. tony , would you like some tea or something ?
coke , thanks .
so how &apos;s it going today ?
she &apos;s stealing .
who ?
that ditsoon , who .
that beautiful plate aunt settimia took from that restaurant in rome . it &apos;s gone .
i don &apos;t know . she seems like a nice person .
she doesn &apos;t fool me for a second .
you sure she stole it ?
you didn &apos;t give it to one of the relatives ?
you keep forcing your possessions on people , thinking you &apos;re gonna die .
i wish it was tomorrow .
and she &apos;s so forward too . who does she think she is ?
she &apos;s happy , ma . she &apos;s singing .
anthony , i don &apos;t want her around here .
i can manage somehow .
no , i &apos;m not giving in to you this time .
she stays .
your uncle called here looking for you .
uncle jun ?
he sounded agitated .
jackie , tell them to leave comley trucking alone .
didn &apos;t know it was a comley truck .
for 21 fucking years , comley &apos;s put food on my table , protection money .
chris didn &apos;t know going in .
bullshit .
want my dvd player ? you can watch grumpy old men .
you gonna be a fucking funny boy now ?
you sopranos .
you hope you and your uncle can settle , not be invited to a fucking sit @-@ down .
you got a crew of cowards you don &apos;t control .
here we go . here we go .
you got a ruling ?
the kids make restitution to junior .
done . it &apos;s done .
christopher moltisanti &apos;s a fucking loose cannon .
you get him out of a sick bed ?
hey , fuck that shit .
giacomino , how you feeling ?
i may be acting boss while your old man &apos;s a guest of the government ...
but i wish somebody &apos;d tell my bowels . they don &apos;t obey .
ah , the fucking chemo .
maybe i should name a successor .
this day and age ? who wants the fucking job ?
your mom tells me you got a girl coming in to help .
that &apos;s good .
all right , i gotta go .
i &apos;ll see you soon .
we okay ?
all right .
the smoke he hires for his own mother .
hey , mikey , how &apos;s the boy ?
what boy ?
the one you sleep with .
i &apos;m just kidding .
how &apos;s jun treating you ?
we &apos;re covering our nut . your nephew retarded ? likes to play with trucks ?
what if jerry lewis heard you talking like that ?
no , that &apos;s muscular dystrophy , tony .
too bad they don &apos;t have a telethon for fuckface @-@ itis .
they find a cure ?
i &apos;m just kidding you .
come on , you &apos;re a good sport . you all right ?
yeah .
you all right ?
yeah .
i &apos;ll see you later .
double cappuccino suprema .
double cappuccino suprema .
thanks . excuse me .
a guy fitting the description does work in this branch .
his name is edguardo arnaz . him and his gay lover both work here .
and i got the address .
paulie , are you listening to me ?
yeah .
again with the rape of the culture .
can we go find these spice girls and get this over with ?
two small café du jours .
that &apos;s it !
what happened ?
beats me .
did you say something to her ?
i know how to talk to people .
these blacks .
who knows what they &apos;ll take the wrong way .
so she &apos;s gone !
traffic and weather on this tuesday morning .
on the westside , there &apos;s a delay as you get out of the lincoln tunnel .
about a 25 @-@ minute delay if you &apos;re approaching near deer route 3 .
the queue beginning just before the bergen viaduct .
you had orders . why didn &apos;t you pay his restitution ?
restitution , okay . but you know how much your uncle wants ? $ 15 .
you jack the wrong truck , that &apos;s what happens .
i didn &apos;t notice you rushing to give back your fucking dvd player .
i &apos;m enjoying it very much .
i screened the bank dick last night . &quot; did you warble , my little wren ? &quot;
i &apos;m not gonna pay it .
oh , yeah ?
i &apos;m serious .
serious is what happens if you don &apos;t pay , by me .
in my thoughts , i use the technique of positive visualization .
how come i always feel undermined ?
by what i did on the triborough towers alone , i should &apos;ve been made .
i &apos;m fucking serious , tony .
the books are closed .
did you talk to jackie about me ?
they &apos;re not accepting any new members , okay ?
you know , you got a reputation for immaturity ...
and it &apos;s not helping , not paying the tributes the acting boss demands .
acting boss , my ass .
everybody knows you really run things since jackie became the &quot; chemo @-@ sabi . &quot;
open the fucking door . open the fucking door !
all right .
all right . fuck it .
but 15 grand is too much !
i &apos;ll tell you what .
you give me the 15k , i &apos;ll talk to uncle junior ...
and maybe i can get it to around 10 .
one more thing .
you leave comley trucking and every other item that belongs to jun ...
including his hemorrhoid doughnut , the fuck alone . got it ?
yeah .
&quot; did you warble , my little wren ? &quot;
what do you think his commission will be ?
two , three grand . ten to junior .
we &apos;re lucky we net 500 bucks from the whole thing .
who is it ?
what ?
mr. arnaz ?
what do you want ?
you seen a schoolteacher &apos;s saturn around here ?
come here !
anybody else here , desi ?
eddie , i &apos;m ready .
yep .
here comes lucy .
those people at the airport shuttle are always late .
eddie !
you boys drove off in the wrong car .
we ain &apos;t saying shit until there &apos;s an attorney .
well , go ahead . make a statement .
i got fucking johnny cochran here !
you boys put a crimp in my week .
get over there .
hey , puss , here &apos;s the fucking set .
look .
fucking car &apos;s been chopped . useless .
that &apos;s not it .
then why is that car inside there ? that dodge ?
why is that motherfucker wearing the fucking plate number i had all week ?
i don &apos;t know .
here &apos;s what &apos;s gonna happen .
the two of youse are climbing over that fence and shagging those plates .
but the razor wire .
then one of you stays with us while the other goes and boosts another saturn .
on the lookout for ducks ?
know the old man pretty good .
don &apos;t look so sad .
remember how pissed you were about the pool filter ?
that were special , them coming here , huh ? don &apos;t you think ?
i wasn &apos;t into it .
what time &apos;s grandma getting here ?
she had to drive fanny to the doctor &apos;s .
then she is picking up my parents and they &apos;re coming here .
they &apos;re each bringing some antipasto .
i complain about my mother , about how she just sits at home ...
and feels sorry for herself .
but she &apos;s always ready to drive those friends of hers that can &apos;t drive .
i &apos;m proud of her . it gives me hope .
it &apos;s getting chilly out here .
make plenty of noise before you open the front door .
you never know who &apos;s in there .
there &apos;s my star @-@ ledger . thanks .
oh , this street , another pain in the ass .
she broke her wrist on the steering column .
a minor concussion .
what about the other woman ?
hip .
we were at the hospital till 2 a.m ...
talking to her doctor and the staff gerontoligist .
they say she shouldn &apos;t live alone anymore .
she can &apos;t manage the telephone .
yet you say she &apos;s healthy and alert .
like a bull .
why ?
i &apos;m just thinking .
i know there are other doctors there ,
but you know from your own life ...
that depression can cause accidents , poor performance or worse .
so , what are you saying ?
unconsciously she tried to whack her friend ?
it &apos;s interesting that you would even take that from what i said .
either way , she could need a change in her living situation ...
be around more people .
we were looking at green grove .
it &apos;s a beautiful facility .
it &apos;s more like a hotel at cap d &apos;antibes .
yeah .
but to her it &apos;s a nursing home .
she needs to see the distinction .
that , in fact , she &apos;s embarking on a rewarding chapter .
i know seniors who are inspired and inspiring .
you &apos;re not forgetting us , buddy ?
ladies .
hey , kenny portugal said to say hello .
oh , yeah . kenny .
the fuck is with this cocksucker ?
back up ! mr. scorsese , good evening .
marty !
kundun ! i liked it .
so my boy at comley ...
said there &apos;s a load of italian suits .
those unload fast . mario &apos;ll take the whole load .
he says shipment moves thursday at 6 a.m.
give me one good reason i should not jack this truck .
it &apos;s junior &apos;s own fault . he gives us no choice except to do it again .
taking that outrageous tribute .
he shits on our heads , we &apos;re supposed to say thanks for the hat .
i &apos;m getting nowhere playing by the rules . fuck tony .
&quot; the books are closed . &quot; blow me .
that &apos;s some true shit .
they &apos;re not confirming any new made guys . how come ?
fucking chaos . nobody knows who &apos;s running things anymore .
guys don &apos;t know who to make payments up the ladder to in some cases .
i &apos;m talking about the year 2000 . the millennium .
where do we go from here ?
ma , this virginia ham ....
go on , get yourself some more .
no , i &apos;m full .
it &apos;s good , though .
you never let me feed you .
so getting back to what we were talking about .
you want that lamp ?
lie down .
that lamp , that &apos;s real ormolu . you know what that &apos;s worth when it &apos;s new ?
we &apos;re fixed good lamp @-@ wise , thank you .
take it and take the barcalounger .
somebody &apos;s gotta take this stuff before i die .
otherwise there &apos;s gonna be a lot of stuff here ...
that the junkman &apos;s gonna have to cart off to the dump .
mom , you &apos;re not gonna die . your stuff won &apos;t be hauled off to the dump .
plan for the future .
the most rewarding chapter of your life &apos;s coming up .
you know my good jewelry ?
the stuff dad gave you .
some of those pieces came right out of cartier &apos;s window .
listen , carm doesn &apos;t want it .
not now .
we want you to live long
and wear your sparklers to your grandkids &apos; graduations .
i gave it all to your cousin josephine .
what the fuck ? the good jewelry ?
she always admired it .
they don &apos;t have much .
you gave her cartier rings , and you give me a vibrating chair ?
your wife never showed any interest in my jewels .
she never complimented me on any of it , as i remember .
before you do more damage to yourself or your grandchildrens &apos; inheritance ...
you &apos;ll stop living alone .
i &apos;m not going to that nursing home .
green grove is a retirement community ! it &apos;s like a hotel at captain teeb &apos;s !
who &apos;s he ?
a captain who owns luxury hotels or something .
i talked to mrs. dicaprio ,
and she &apos;s got a corner suite available .
it &apos;s available . it &apos;ll go fast .
of course it &apos;s available . somebody died !
you gotta stop with this black poison cloud all the time . i can &apos;t take it !
oh , poor you !
i got problems at work , problems at home .
i got a friend diagnosed with cancer .
most parents would be grateful
if their children did this !
i &apos;m not going to that place .
i will go to court and get power of attorney and place you there .
then kill me now .
go on , go into the ham ...
... and take the carving knife and stab me here .
here ! now please , it would hurt me less than what you just said .
i know seniors that are inspired !
yo , money , we said we &apos;d meet out front , and you &apos;re not even dressed !
i &apos;m taking a pass .
what ? it &apos;s italian suits , christopher .
there was a time when being with tony &apos;s crew was all i ever dreamed of .
so what am i doing ?
this is some fucking note here .
don &apos;t wake her up .
come on , it &apos;s 5 : 15 .
maybe one reason things are so fucked in the organization these days ...
is guys running off not listening to middle management .
&quot; fuck tony . &quot; that &apos;s a quote .
we have to stick together .
why be in a crew ?
why be a gangster ?
hey , coach ?
suck my dick .
yo ! hey ! yo ! we need some help over here !
okay , let &apos;s be very cool , yo ! get down out of the cab !
you heard the motherfucker .
i &apos;m a friend of billy &apos;s . your friend on the inside .
yeah , cool . &quot; increase the peace , &quot; that &apos;s our motto .
i &apos;m gonna take my lunch , okay ?
yeah , whatever . come on .
hold up , man . you can &apos;t drive a fisher price .
what &apos;s with the gun pointed sideways ?
get out !
come on , get down ! you drive , i &apos;ll direct you .
jesus !
control your shit , fool !
fuck , i &apos;m fucked ! fuck !
fuck !

you excited about coming to live with us , hon ?
you will be . trust me .
look , ma , here &apos;s your stuff .
wow , they made good time .
you got your own bed and your dresser .
you know , when my grandmother went to live ... elsewhere ...
they weren &apos;t allowed personal effects .
all right , ma , sign right here .
yes ?
mr. soprano , do you have an uncle junior ?
he tracked me down here ?
line two ? here you go .
i &apos;ll call him back .
he &apos;ll return the call . he did ?
it &apos;s urgent . she said he sounded upset . he &apos;ll call back .
livia , did you ever hear the old italian saying ? my aunt used to go :
what &apos;s that mean , bonnie ?
time and patience change the mulberry leaf to silk .
you gonna be all right ?
yeah , sure .
thanks for all your help .
i &apos;ll make us a nice lunch .
i &apos;ve got some fantastic prosciutto in there .
hello ?
yeah . it &apos;s christopher .
i &apos;ve been calling for hours . call me on an outside line .
t , don &apos;t get mad . there &apos;s been a little shit .
i had nothing to do with it--
spit it out !
brendan hit comley again .
he what ?
and the driver , you know--
no , i don &apos;t know .
he caught some friendly fire or something and he &apos;s gone .
oh , fuck .
what do we do , t ? brendan didn &apos;t fence the load .
he &apos;s thinking it was mario who dimed us to junior last time .
fuck !
hey , ton .
sorry you have to wreck your saturday like this .
you boys . you boys , i &apos;ll tell you .
it &apos;s beautiful stuff , though .
ton , i &apos;m so sorry .
shut up .
just so you realize i had nothing to do with this .
ton , that &apos;s true . he stood home .
shut up .
stood home ?
did you do anything to stop it ? did you offer any guidance ?
what do we mean when we say leadership ?
part of it &apos;s the crank . but i &apos;m going into detox , swear on my mother .
brendan , shut the fuck up . you want to get me clipped ?
what are we gonna do ?
you &apos;re gonna put these suits back in the truck and give them back .
fuck !
then call my uncle and tell him it &apos;s done .
what about the dead guy ?
prod him with a stick .
light a candle to st. anthony . but i think you &apos;re fucked .
ton ...
what if this didn &apos;t go back ? would it be a problem ?
i don &apos;t see you assholes putting that rack , and that rack ...
and this rack here back in the truck .
just when i thought i was out , they pull me back in .
hey , mr. miller , your car is back .
my wife dropped me off and there it was ,
in my parking spot .
my uncle pussy helped my dad locate it .
uncle pussy ?
he &apos;s in the car business .
i don &apos;t know what to say to your dad , i mean , thanks of course .
it &apos;s nice and clean too .
whoa , different keys !
it &apos;s probably too much to hope my papers are still inside the trunk .
it &apos;s a different color .
my dad &apos;s a hero .
did you actually lose consciousness like with the ducks ?
no .
just a shortness of breath and the white spots in my field of vision .
improvement .
because i &apos;m sad to put my mother away ?
sad is good . unconscious isn &apos;t .
she &apos;ll be in very good hands . you &apos;ve done the best for her .
she won &apos;t speak to me .
that is sad . but whose choice is that ?
somehow that doesn &apos;t make it any better .
can you admit to yourself that yes , you &apos;re sad ...
but you &apos;re angry and full of rage ?
i &apos;m sad .
it &apos;s hard to admit that ...
you may have feelings of hatred towards your mother , isn &apos;t it ?
you &apos;re out of your tree .
listen carefully . of course you love her .
what i &apos;m trying to say is , own the anger instead of displacing it .
otherwise it defines your life .
it needs to be acknowledged .
it &apos;s a good thing time is up . i don &apos;t want to talk to you anymore .
&quot; hate your mother . &quot;
shit .
a what do you call it ? a menu .
press two if you know your party &apos;s extension .
is that an operator or an answering machine ?
let &apos;s see . hello ? hello ?
press zero . hello ?
