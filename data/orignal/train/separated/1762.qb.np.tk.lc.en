leonard , i &apos;ve been working on an opening joke
for our lecture at berkeley .
oh , i like to laugh .
but say it anyway .
okay , um ...
what do you say to a graduate
of the uc berkeley physics department ?
i &apos;ll have fries with that .
because his education hasn &apos;t prepared him
for a career in the sciences .
you know , when they chase you out of there ,
you only have to run faster than sheldon .
are you all set for your trip ?
yeah , i think so .
i just restocked the old prk .
&quot; p.r.k &quot; ?
public restroom kit .
everything a boy needs for making pee pee
in new and strange places .
i don &apos;t see what &apos;s crazy about bringing a backpack
with your own toilet paper and purell .
keep going .
and rubber gloves , uh , air freshener .
um , noise @-@ cancelling headphones .
oh , danger whistle .
pepper spray .
ooh , a multi @-@ language &quot; occupied &quot; sign .
uh , let &apos;s see .
we have seat protectors , uh , booties for my shoes ,
a clothespin for my nose .
oh , and a mirror on a stick ,
so i can make sure the person in the stall next to me
isn &apos;t some kind of weirdo .
you still worried some berkeley girl
is gonna steal him away ?
yes , who do you think gave him the danger whistle ?
would you like to play a physics car game i invented
called &quot; i can &apos;t spy &quot; ?
it &apos;s all the nail @-@ biting tension of &quot; i spy &quot;
说出指定对白 并提示该事物首字母给对方猜
but the added fun of subatomic particles
and waves outside the visible spectrum .
if it &apos;s half as much fun as
&quot; one times ten to the fourth bottles of beer on the wall , &quot;
反复唱着歌词 每次往下减一 直到墙上没了
i &apos;m in .
i &apos;ll begin .
uh , i can &apos;t spy with my little eye ...
something passing right through us .
that soy frappuccino i had .
will you please play the game ?
i can &apos;t spy with my little eye
something passing right through us .
i don &apos;t know , um ...
if 65 billion solar neutrinos pass
through a square centimeter every second ,
given the surface area of this car is
about 60,000 square centimeters ,
that means 3.9 times ten to the 15th solar neutrinos ?
i don &apos;t want to play anymore .
we haven &apos;t been on a road trip in a while .
this is fun .
we get it-- you won the game .
stop bragging .
no , listen , we wrote a paper together .
now we get to go to a university and talk about it ?
that &apos;s pretty cool .
i suppose it is .
in fact , if you &apos;d like to celebrate with a little music ,
i &apos;d be okay with that .
what ... ?
this road trip just got crazy .
play that funky music , white boy .
i &apos;m surprised you know that reference .
what reference ?
so , i put stickers on everything we &apos;re gonna sell .
we just need help taking it all out to the driveway .
can i be in charge of pricing ?
i &apos;ve been going to garage sales my whole life .
can you believe i got these pantyhose for a nickel ?
all right , amy &apos;s in charge of pricing
and being 75 .
hey , penny , can you give me a hand with this ?
sure .
aw , we had one of these growing up .
i used to play all the time .
oh , yeah ? i love ping @-@ pong .
oh , i meant beer pong .
i had a table , too ,
but i didn &apos;t have any friends ,
so all i did was serve .
you know , you can leave one side up and play against it .
and if i had a friend , they might have told me that .
excuse me .
why is there a sticker on this ?
it &apos;s my tardis from doctor who .
内部空间比外面大许多
i was planning on moving it in the house .
i think you just answered your own question .
come on , one day , this may double in value
and be worth half what i paid for it .
sweetie , we have a lot to do .
we don &apos;t need to decide this right now .
well , i guess as long as you &apos;re keeping an open mind .
of course .
* play that funky music , white boy *
* play that funky music right *
* play that funky music , white boy *
so ... they &apos;re requesting
that the white boy play the funky music , yes ?
yes .
and this music we &apos;re listening to right now
is funky as well ?
sure .
let me ask you this .
do you think
this song is the music the white boy ultimately play ?
it could be .
so it &apos;s like the musical equivalent of russell &apos;s paradox ,
the question of whether the set of all sets
that don &apos;t contain themselves as members contains itself ?
exactly .
well ...
then i hate it .
music should just be fun .
making great time .
gonna be there pretty early .
will our hotel room be ready ?
i doubt it .
aren &apos;t you worried that sitting in the lobby
for a long period of time
might attract the attention of the hotel detective ?
if we do ,
we &apos;ll just tell him to &quot; hit the bricks , see ? &quot;
seems a little confrontational , but all right .
you know , we won &apos;t be very far from skywalker ranch .
16平方公里地 用作电影拍摄与工作场所
oh , that &apos;s true .
it &apos;s not like we can get in there .
why not ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t think george lucas put his headquarters
in the middle of nowhere
because he wanted people dropping in .
yoda &apos;s swamp was in the middle of nowhere .
tatooine was in the middle of nowhere .
hoth was in the middle of nowhere .
that &apos;s code , leonard .
he wants us to drop in .
we do have time .
i mean , we could drive by and just look at it .
yes ! oh ...
i &apos;m so excited .
and i just can &apos;t hide it .
&quot; i &apos;m about to lose control , and i think i like it . &quot;
《 i &apos;m so excited 》 的歌词
what are you talking about ?
so when do you guys think you &apos;re gonna move in ?
we &apos;re still figuring how much remodeling we want to do .
it &apos;s tricky finding the right balance between
&quot; tasteful modern &quot; and &quot; jewish mother tchotchke crapfest . &quot;
have you made a decision about the tardis ?
i think i can sell it if we call it ,
&quot; big british porta @-@ potty . &quot;
we &apos;re not selling it-- it &apos;s mine .
you can &apos;t just decide .
how about i arm @-@ wrestle you ?
that &apos;s not fair .
it &apos;s like me challenging you to a sexy pants contest .
you could play ping @-@ pong for it .
i would do that .
how is that fair ?
you grew up with a table .
yes , but i mostly used it as a battlefield
in an ongoing war between the transformers and the thundercats
for control of a bra i had found in the woods .
bernadette , for every episode of doctor who
leonard has made me sit through ,
i will play on your behalf
and send that tardis back to gallifrey ,
where i hate that i know it belongs .
yes , penny plays for me .
that &apos;s not fair-- she has upper body muscles .
dude , three @-@ time sanskriti school
for well @-@ born boys badminton champion .
that &apos;s right-- okay , raj can play for me .
ooh , you just chose champions .
it &apos;s like we &apos;re reenacting the ancient german practice
of trial by combat .
yeah , it &apos;s also like
when the mountain fought the red viper in game of thrones .
leonard makes you watch that , too ?
no , no , i like that show .
it &apos;s got dragons and people doing it .
so it &apos;s settled .
the fate of doctor who &apos;s tardis will be decided
by a game of thrones inspired death @-@ match on the battlefield
of thundercats versus transformers .
if you still have that bra , i &apos;ll give you a nickel for it .
there it is .
it &apos;s just a gate .
on a road .
wasn &apos;t even that hard to find .
this is so amazing !
i know !
you want to get a picture ?
i want more than a picture .
i want to go in .
well , so do i , but they &apos;ll never let us .
is that the attitude that helped you get penny ?
no , but i don &apos;t have three years
to make that gate feel sorry for me .
uh , there &apos;s a speaker box .
drive up , push the button ,
and let &apos;s see what happens .
okay , yeah .
what do we have to lose ?
i &apos;m a little nervous .
well , get over it .
confidence is key in these situations .
right .
you pushed it-- are you out of your mind ? !
may i help you ?
uh , uh ... we don &apos;t have an appointment ,
and @-@ and we don &apos;t belong here ,
but we @-@ we &apos;re , like , crazy @-@ big fans .
i mean ...
&quot; crazy for star wars &quot; crazy ,
not crazy like we have a backpack full of duct tape ,
although we do have a backpack
that you really don &apos;t want to look in .
you &apos;re blowing it .
we want to meet george lucas
and become his friends and play with him !
hello ?
this speaker &apos;s not working , just pull up .
and that &apos;s how it &apos;s done .
all right , we &apos;ve defeated the first challenge .
now we must steel ourselves to face the monster
who defends the gate .
we &apos;re trying to get past a security guard ,
not rescue zelda .
i think what really needs to be rescued is your sense of whimsy ,
but one quest at a time .
so what &apos;s the plan ?
uh , i &apos;m just gonna be honest with the guy .
honesty will never get us in .
well , what &apos;s your plan ?
all right , my plan is predicated on the assumption
that they have a nurse &apos;s office
and your willingness to be lightly stabbed .
who are you here to see ?
uh , i &apos;m just gonna tell you the truth .
oh , you are killing me .
we don &apos;t have an appointment .
we @-@ we &apos;re just fans of mr. lucas &apos;s work ,
and we thought we &apos;d take a shot
and see if we could get in and look around .
sorry , guys , we get this a lot .
can &apos;t let you in .
what if i told you that i was the voice of yoda ?
a recording session i must attend .
i &apos;m sorry , don &apos;t listen to him .
we &apos;re actually physicists .
we &apos;re giving a lecture at berkeley later today .
we just ... we had some time to kill .
hey , listen , you seem like decent guys .
i can &apos;t let you in ,
but i got some hats and t @-@ shirts i can give you .
thank you so much .
see ?
maybe honesty is the best ...
what are you doing ?
shedding the yoke of my oppressors ,
you blind , sad little man .
don &apos;t move !
code a @-@ a @-@ 23 , a @-@ a @-@ 23 .
copy .
i can see the ranch , leonard !
oh , it &apos;s rustic , it &apos;s lovely .
i &apos;d take a picture , but people are chasing me .
i &apos;m gonna make it ... !
i &apos;m gonna make it !
they have tasers , but they wouldn &apos;t dare use ...
come on , raj .
you are the king kong of ping @-@ pong .
you are the menace of table tennis .
put her away , &apos; cause i don &apos;t have a third one .
yes !
rajesh eight , penny four .
sorry , he &apos;s really good .
hey , raj .
if howard can &apos;t keep the tardis ,
how great would it look at your place ?
what ?
yeah , what ?
i don &apos;t know much about doctor who ,
but if , um , you were to put this right outside your front door
and open up the back ,
it would be like your entire apartment was
the inside of the tardis ,
which is pretty cool
&apos;cause on the show , the inside of the tardis
is bigger than the outside .
but then again , i don &apos;t know much about doctor who .
don &apos;t listen to her .
you and i go way back-- we &apos;re like brothers .
we are . we are .
oh , no ! what a terrible serve !
sorry , brother .
eight @-@ five .
this is ridiculous .
i want a new champion .
amy , were you serious about being able to serve ?
uh , it @-@ it &apos;s been a long time .
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m probably pretty rusty .
she &apos;s my champion !
well , if you can switch champions , so can i.
i want raj .
hey .
oh , come on , like you even care .
i care !
oh , wait , no , i don &apos;t . good luck , raj .
you know , i thought our friendship meant more to you .
so did i.
do you think they &apos;re gonna call the police ?
i don &apos;t know .
maybe they &apos;ll call imperial officers to take us
to a holding cell on the death star .
oh , i think that &apos;s below the pay grade of an imperial officer .
stormtroopers are really the ones who ...
oh , shut up .
he &apos;s right .
uh , stormtroopers actually combine both the function
of infantry and military police .
uh @-@ huh , i &apos;m normally very nice ,
but you shut up , too .
so ...
what are you in for ?
honestly , i just wanted to meet mr. lucas and say thank you .
you know , growing up , the movies had such an impact on my life .
i never really fit in anywhere .
till i discovered the worlds he created
and finally found a place where i belong .
but why are you here ?
oh , i , uh , i hopped a fence ,
and they caught me in the sculpture gallery
making out with a chewbacca statue .
excuse me .
leonard ,
they have a sculpture gallery .
all right , i talked to my supervisor ,
and we &apos;re gonna let you go with a warning .
but if you ever come back ,
we will call the police and press charges .
we understand .
thank you so much .
uh , what about me ?
no , you &apos;re not going anywhere , kissy face .
let &apos;s go .
i have to take your picture to post at the guard gate .
uh , one question about that picture .
can it be with george lucas ?
ooh , grumpy you are .
okay , this is the match that decides it all .
first to 11 wins .
serve switches every five points .
and just so you know , when this started ,
i was going to put the tardis in a discreet corner of the house ,
but i &apos;ve since turned mean ,
and now it &apos;s going right in the middle of the living room
on a rotating platform with a sign that says &quot; suck it . &quot;
game on .
except ...
raj is gonna win .
isn &apos;t that right , raj ?
uh , yeah , i mean , her serve was pretty good .
come on , get in her head .
be intimidating .
okay , uh ...
i &apos;m gonna own you , bitch !
that &apos;s not nice .
let &apos;s just play .
one @-@ zero .
two .
three .
four .
five @-@ nothing .
wait , did you play badminton
or sad @-@ minton ?
don &apos;t listen to him-- all she &apos;s got is a serve .
now , grab a fresh tampon and put her away .
wha ... ?
a @-@ and that &apos;s not offensive ?
where &apos;s the line ?
it &apos;s in your purse . play .
one @-@ five .
two @-@ five .
three @-@ five .
four @-@ five .
five @-@ five !
six .
seven .
eight .
nine .
ten @-@ five !
six .
seven .
eight .
nine .
ten @-@ ten !
well , that was an exciting 40 seconds .
it was , and now the serve is back to you ,
and the game is over .
you know , amy , i , uh ...
can &apos;t help but wonder how sheldon would react
if the tardis was at your place .
don &apos;t listen to her , just hit the ball .
keep talking .
if this doesn &apos;t get him into your bedroom ,
nothing will .
are you still mad at me ?
yes , we missed our lecture , we were almost arrested ,
and you got me locked in a room with a man
who forced his tongue down the throat of a stuffed wookie .
boy , some people are just glass @-@ half @-@ empty .
the glass is empty , sheldon .
it &apos;s completely empty .
if you gave that glass to a man who was dying of thirst ,
he would be dead , do you know why ?
before i answer , was he a smoker ?
i think you &apos;re looking at this all wrong .
fine , then tell me how i should be looking at it .
well , not only did we go to skywalker ranch , we got in .
and no one we know can say that .
and for all the times you find me irritating ,
today you got to watch someone shoot me with a taser .
that part was pretty good .
see ?
you did flop around a lot .
i &apos;ll take your word for it .
i was too busy trying not to defecate .
you know , when they were escorting us to the detaining room ,
i looked through a door ,
and i &apos;m pretty sure i saw a display case
with the ark of the covenant .
that &apos;s amazing .
i know .
and i saw jabba the hutt riding by on a motorcycle .
although that was right after the tasing ,
so who can say for sure ?
i @-@ i guess this could count as an adventure .
it was .
and even though we &apos;re not allowed back there ,
they can never take today away from us .
unlike my sense of smell ,
which hasn &apos;t returned since the tasing .
no , i got nothing .
amy , the daleks are right on my tail !
quick , we need to reset the time circuits .
oh , no , i left my sonic screwdriver behind .
really should have thought this through .
