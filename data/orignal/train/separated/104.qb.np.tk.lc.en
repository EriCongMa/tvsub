第五季 第十九集
hello ?
we have two hours .
no , you have an hour and 15 minutes .
what ? when did that happen ?
we don &apos;t get a grace period
because they &apos;re sending it in digitally .
yeah , it &apos;s alicia florrick .
i called ahead .
oh , good . you &apos;re there .
i just confirmed with the clerk
the filing rules recently changed .
the court will not accept documents after 8 : 00 p.m.
you have to get a signature in by 8 : 00 .
got it , but i won &apos;t be able to help you with case prep tonight .
don &apos;t worry about it .
the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office delayed them , anyway .
both the burglary and the mail fraud .
so we have another month . guess we caught a break .
wait , they delayed them ?
when ? both ?
yeah , they &apos;re shuffling around prosecutors .
don &apos;t worry about it .
just get his signature .
if we &apos;re even one minute late ,
we &apos;re out the $ 1 million bonus .
okay , i &apos;ll do my best , but you know how he is .
how who is ?
mr. sweeney , hello . i &apos;ll call you back .
you have come to my engagement party .
i &apos;m honored .
actually , no .
mr. sweeney , i called earlier .
we just discovered you left your signature
off the financial disclosure .
business . you &apos;re always business these days , alicia .
marta , mrs. florrick needs a drink !
no , thank you , mr. sweeney .
i just really need to get you to sign these ...
i &apos;m getting married , alicia . congratulations are in order .
i @-@ i thought you already were married .
yes , i was .
but i became disenchanted ,
so i had to get rid of her .
through divorce .
where &apos;s your sense of humor ?
i need you to initial here , here and sign here .
i heard about your old partner , will gardner .
i &apos;m so sorry .
thank you .
no , i mean it .
i liked will . he was a good guy .
yep . can we ... sign these please ?
and then , life moves on .
you have a new firm , i &apos;m getting married .
it &apos;s the seasons of life .
mr. sweeney ?
yeah ?
look at me .
i am .
no , you &apos;re looking over my head .
it &apos;s these glasses .
whoever you &apos;re staring at ,
it matches their body type with a porn star .
well , that &apos;s surprising .
mr. sweeney ...
if you don &apos;t sign these documents right now ,
the merger will be off .
do you know what ld50 is ?
mr. sweeney ...
it &apos;s called &quot; lethal dose 50 % . &quot;
it &apos;s a test , devised by claxon @-@ brant ,
to discover the toxicity of their pharmaceuticals .
if it kills less than 50 % of its animal test subjects ,
it &apos;s a success .
suddenly , you &apos;re concerned with animal testing ?
i can &apos;t have a heart ?
tell me the bottom line , mr. sweeney .
what do i have to do ?
convince renata .
who &apos;s renata ?
my fiancee .
do you really not follow my life ?
i follow yours .
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m hurt .
eli , hold on a minute .
you want me to convince your fiancee that if you merge ,
you can stop the animal testing at claxon @-@ brant ?
and then you &apos;ll sign these ?
what is it , eli ? i &apos;m a little busy .
your son zach .
what ? wh @-@ what happened ?
he &apos;s on gawker . i &apos;m looking at it right now .
looking at what ?
zach with a bong .
he ... what ?
he has a bong in his hand .
peter is coming out against legalizing marijuana .
eli ...
this month was supposed to be about us coordinating our message ,
and people are pointing out the hypocrisy !
eli , i have to go . i &apos;ll call zach .
no , i will call him .
no , eli , i &apos;ll call him .
oh , renata .
meet my second @-@ favorite person in the world ,
alicia florrick .
bonjour .
i have a theory about women with three @-@ syllable names .
oh , darling , you &apos;re going to have to exert your ...
considerable powers on this one .
she &apos;s a saint .
every saint is just a sinner waiting for an opportunity .
colin &apos;s told me a lot about you , alicia .
i &apos;m jealous .
jealous . pshaw .
he told me you have some great advice
for how to keep a marriage alive .
ah , perhaps another time .
alicia wants to talk to you about my merger .
peta stuff ?
i like that shade of lipstick on you .
it &apos;s very flattering .
thank you . um ...
if i could just get you on the phone
with the ceo of claxon @-@ brant ,
and he will explain that they &apos;re phasing out the animal testing .
have you seen the pictures ?
oh , my god , did we invite her ?
she &apos;s my bridesmaid .
people pay lip service to the three rs ,
but they never follow through .
well , if you &apos;re on the board ,
you can impact their choices .
you don &apos;t even know what the three rs are , do you ?
this is fascinating ,
but i have a party to prepare .
yes , mr. lipsger , uh , one moment , please .
just @-@ just talk to him . give him a chance .
renata , ceos lie .
that &apos;s what they &apos;re paid for .
demetrius , i told you not to call .
hello ?
zach , it &apos;s mom .
hey , mom . what &apos;s up ?
there is a picture of you on gawker at a party with a bong .
with a ... mom , that &apos;s a ...
i @-@ i didn &apos;t have a bong .
zach , there &apos;s a picture of you .
eli just called me .
that &apos;s ... it &apos;s not mine , mom .
it &apos;s not mine .
whose party were you at anyway ?
shauna norrel &apos;s . you said it was all right for me to go .
yes , to go to the party , not to do drugs .
i wasn &apos;t .
i didn &apos;t . i was actually taking it away from shauna ,
so she wouldn &apos;t use it .
oh , come on , zach .
it &apos;s true , mom .
zach , i &apos;m gonna have to call you back .
so ? what did he say ? can colin sign ?
put me on the board .
oh , come on , renata !
shut up , morgan .
colin hasn &apos;t had the best luck with his wives .
i want to be a bigger part of his life .
put me on the board , and i &apos;ll get colin to sign .
what &apos;s going on ? what happened ?
he &apos;s signing it now .
we &apos;re good !
have a sangria .
and i &apos;ll sign the last line .
sign the last line .
and i &apos;ll have a sangria .
it &apos;s coming to you now .
let me know when you get it .
okay .
uh , not yet . probably in a minute .
cary , who &apos;s the prosecutor on your two criminal cases ?
the ones that were delayed .
um , you mean before or after ?
before ; the prosecutor before .
uh , finn polmar , why ?
why was he taken off ?
i have no idea . okay , there it is .
i got it .
i &apos;ll forward it on to the court clerk .
wait there until i get the confirmation .
finn polmar .
hey , it &apos;s alicia .
oh , hey , what &apos;s up ?
my partner cary agos was on two cases
with you as the prosecutor .
we just got word that you were moved off them .
that &apos;s right .
is there some reason for this ?
something to do with castro ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m just worried that he might be coming after y--
finn , is someone in the office with you ?
that &apos;s right .
okay , i &apos;m gonna call you back .
who was that ?
aw , just some defense attorney ; nothing important .
we have a problem , alicia .
what is it ?
&quot; other expenses . &quot;
clarke brought this to my attention .
the financial disclosure statement-- sweeney lied .
he put all his recreational expenses in it .
recreational ?
drugs and sexual therapy .
oh , dear lord .
yeah , he could get arrested for this , alicia .
it &apos;s $ 145,000 .
okay , well , uh , can i cross out the amount on the contract ?
yes . and get him to initial it .
and have him refund $ 145,000
into his business account ,
and i &apos;ll try to get the filing back from the courthouse .
we have 30 minutes .
have you heard anything from zach ?
i have a reporter on the line .
eli , i cannot talk right now .
alicia , i promise you this is the most important thing
you &apos;re doing right now .
zach wasn &apos;t smoking pot .
it wasn &apos;t his .
great !
then i need him to say that to a reporter .
he &apos;s not talking to a reporter , eli .
you don &apos;t understand . this is not a 24 @-@ hour news cycle anymore .
this is a photo , everyone is linking to it .
we need to put a statement out now !
alicia , did you hear what i just said ?
alicia ! alicia !
eli , i &apos;ll put out a statement , but i can &apos;t right now .
hold on , hold on .
hello ?
alicia , hey . it &apos;s finn .
castro was in the office .
oh , uh , yeah , finn . can you hold on for a moment ?
mr. sweeney ?
alicia ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
mr. sweeney , you lied on your financial disclosure .
we have 24 minutes to refund your account
and sign a new a statement . please !
i don &apos;t lie .
look , you can &apos;t include sexual therapy
as a business expense .
it &apos;s political correctness--
there it is .
initial here and here where i made the correction .
finn , i am so sorry i got distracted .
mrs. florrick ?
yes . who &apos;s this ?
shauna norrel , zach &apos;s friend .
oh , sh @-@ shauna . how are you ?
good . except zach called me about this party at my house .
and how i was the one with the bong , smoking pot ?
yes ! thank you for calling . it &apos;s such a relief ...
what are you doing ?
i have to read it first .
i told him i couldn &apos;t lie for him .
excuse me ?
smoking pot .
i couldn &apos;t lie for him about smoking pot .
i think the best thing for zach is he face the fact
he has a problem .
signed . now what do i do ?
renata !
she did it !
oh , my god !
darling , who ?
renata , are you all right ?
what &apos;s going on ?
i went into the bathroom because she wouldn &apos;t come out !
there was nothing i could do !
oh , my god !
thank you for answering our questions , mrs. florrick .
no problem . anyway i can help .
you &apos;re mr. sweeney &apos;s lawyer , isn &apos;t that correct ?
it is . his civil lawyer .
but you &apos;ve handled his past criminal matters as well ?
yes .
and you claim you were with mr. sweeney the entire time ?
no , not the entire time .
he was within my view
from approximately 6 : 55 to 7 : 45 .
and you , um ...
witnessed the victim on the phone--
morgan donnelly ?
that &apos;s right .
in tears .
and who was she on the phone with ?
demetrie , i told you to leave me alone ...
someone named demetrie .
she was upset .
told him to leave her alone .
that &apos;s when you saw her crying ?
mom , i didn &apos;t have a bong .
come on , renata !
no .
she was crying after the phone call .
it was after that .
i see .
is everything all right ?
i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s just odd .
you happened to be present
during another murder in mr. sweeney &apos;s home
four years ago ?
isn &apos;t that correct ?
no , that is not correct .
there was an involuntary manslaughter
in mr. sweeney &apos;s home four years ago .
but i was not present .
i arrived afterwards .
well ...
that makes it much less convenient .
and it &apos;s also not correct
to call tonight &apos;s death a murder , detective .
it &apos;s my understanding that it was a suicide .
ligature marks .
legs , arms ...
a double set of marks on her neck .
one from this rope ,
and another from a rope earlier .
this woman shows
all the signs of being tied up and tortured .
then , uh , strung up later
to make it look like a suicide .
normally , when i find a woman &apos;s body in mr. sweeney &apos;s home ,
he &apos;d be in cuffs .
and yet you were here to offer him an alibi ?
i was here on legal business .
it &apos;s not coincidental
that you &apos;ve been with mr. sweeney , both times ,
a dead woman was found in his house .
you were brought here to be his alibi .
i was with mr. sweeney ,
or within his sights ,
from 6 : 55 until 7 : 45 .
so the topic of the moment seems to be marijuana .
yes , mr. governor .
do you see illinois going the way of colorado
and legalizing pot ?
well , no , i don &apos;t , ray , and here &apos;s why :
i think our health care issues are extreme enough without
adding potential costs on top of that .
kate guinness , chicago ledger .
mr. governor , how do you square this
with the actions of your son ?
well , kate ...
um , if you &apos;re referring to the photo
that was online last night ,
my son told me that he was actually
intervening to stop someone else from taking drugs .
really ?
yes , really .
are there any other questions ?
governor , it &apos;s ray again .
how do you square this with your brother @-@ in @-@ law &apos;s statements ?
my brother @-@ in @-@ law &apos;s statements ...
i , uh ...
get out of the way , nora !
come on !
uh , yeah . i did .
i saw the photo of zach .
with that rather adult @-@ sized bong , don &apos;t you think ?
all i can say is more power to him .
holy heaven ...
and it &apos;s like the president said ,
that , you know , pot &apos;s no worse than alcohol .
you should see alicia drink .
uh , i &apos;m just glad he &apos;s taking my advice
and loosening up a little .
maybe it &apos;ll force his dad to change his mind
about these ridiculous laws .
i &apos;m watching , eli .
you need to get on with him , alicia .
you need to talk to him now !
don &apos;t worry , i was planning to .
what &apos;s wrong ? what &apos;s happening ?
nothing . uh ... one problem at a time .
mr. state &apos;s attorney , what a surprise .
detective .
alicia , i &apos;m in awe of your offices .
very ... youthful .
thank you .
makes me miss .
almost .
so ... what brings you here ?
a high @-@ profile case .
in an election year ?
we have some photos we &apos;d like to show you .
where &apos;s this ?
upstairs in sweeney &apos;s townhouse .
i must have missed the search warrant .
a police officer was looking for the bathroom
and he opened this door .
by accident .
i see .
did he ever find the bathroom ?
that &apos;s where we think
morgan donnelly was tortured and murdered .
then her body was moved to the adjacent bathroom
to make it look like suicide .
really ?
who are we thinking did it ?
we were hoping to ask your client .
i &apos;m a witness now .
i &apos;ve had to relinquish
mr. sweeney &apos;s representation to my partner .
well , we &apos;d love to know
why he has a torture chamber in his townhouse .
these make it look so grim .
it &apos;s really quite sweet .
this torture chamber is in your townhouse ?
it &apos;s not a torture chamber .
sometimes we put flowers in there .
and a vase . and pillows .
it &apos;s shibari .
what is ... shibari ?
no . shibari .
it &apos;s the ancient japanese art
of sexual satisfaction
though the tightening and loosening of knots and ropes .
are you kidding me ?
if detective johnson doesn &apos;t want an explanation ,
we can accommodate him .
go on .
two subjects sit in facing harnesses
and tie each other in .
they control each other &apos;s sensations
by pulling and tightening knots
through these winches and pulleys .
auto @-@ asphyxiation .
no .
auto @-@ asphyxiation is porn .
shibari is art .
you should try it sometime , mr. state &apos;s attorney .
clears the mind .
did you do this ... - shibari .
did you do this with morgan ?
the victim ?
uh ... on other occasions .
not last night .
so she just killed herself in the ropes
and then strung herself up in the bathroom ?
i &apos;ll ask my client
not to answer that hypothetical .
okay , look .
as you can see , what you called a torture chamber
was actually for the private recreational use of my client .
and i &apos;d like to call a halt to this interview .
that &apos;s fine .
mrs. florrick ...
would you mind staying for a few minutes ?
we don &apos;t need it .
i think we do .
do you recognize this man ?
i do .
did you see him at the party ?
i did .
where ?
i passed him by the bar .
and that was it ?
no , i saw him climbing the stairs
to the fourth floor .
at what time ?
around 7 : 35 p.m.
do you know who this is ?
no .
the victim &apos;s boyfriend , demetrius rowe .
you said you heard her argue with a demetrie .
demetrie , i told you ...
it could &apos;ve been demetrius .
you &apos;ll have to excuse detective johnson .
he &apos;s worried that you &apos;re confusing your duty as a defense attorney
with your duties as a witness .
you &apos;re not . are you ?
good luck , mr. state &apos;s attorney .
finn polmar .
finn , i had a thought .
about how to keep castro from firing you .
you know he &apos;s running for state &apos;s attorney ?
yeah , i do . why ?
run against him .
mr. sweeney , please .
tell him that it &apos;s about my meeting
with the state &apos;s attorney .
finn .
it &apos;s a shakman violation .
he can &apos;t fire you if you &apos;re running against him .
it would be retaliation .
i &apos;m not running for state &apos;s attorney .
there are a dozen candidates .
well , that doesn &apos;t make a difference .
no , all you have to do
is file the campaign papers .
you don &apos;t have to actually run .
he can &apos;t retaliate against you .
look , thanks for ...
thinking creatively , but , uh ...
let me think about it , okay ?
alicia ?
yeah . uh , good .
uh , i &apos;ll talk to you .
you made a mistake ?
to be exact ,
i think i might have made a mistake .
this is the victim &apos;s boyfriend ,
demetrius rowe .
and this is mr. sweeney &apos;s manservant , barry hildom .
you confused these two men ?
i was ... very distracted .
i was dealing with a lot of things .
it &apos;s a good thing i wasn &apos;t there .
or you might &apos;ve said i was the killer .
do you want me not to admit my mistake ?
no .
thank you for coming forward , alicia .
it was the right thing to do .
but now that you &apos;ve admitted error ,
is there a chance that you could be wrong
about mr. sweeney &apos;s alibi ?
no .
you &apos;re sure ?
just think a minute , alicia .
if you were distracted ,
dealing with a lot of things ...
mr. sweeney ...
you don &apos;t understand .
this isn &apos;t a 24 @-@ hour news cycle anymore .
i &apos;ve thought about it , mr. state &apos;s attorney .
mr. sweeney couldn &apos;t have gone upstairs
without me seeing him .
okay .
thank you .
i hope you &apos;re right ,
because we &apos;re ready to make an arrest .
and if you &apos;re wrong ,
we &apos;re arresting the wrong person .
mr. sweeney ...
... why is your tux jacket off ?
i don &apos;t know .
i didn &apos;t want to get it dirty .
dirty with morgan &apos;s blood ?
what a sense of humor you have .
no , with this ... drumstick i &apos;m eating-- see ?
but why would you take your jacket off for that ?
wouldn &apos;t you be more likely to get your shirt dirty ?
i don &apos;t know .
what do you think ?
my name &apos;s detective lou johnson , and i &apos;m here to
exercise an arrest warrant for the murder of morgan donnelly .
wait , wait , what &apos;s going on ?
mr. sweeney , please step back .
ms. ellard , you &apos;re under arrest
for the murder of morgan donnelly .
wait , but i didn &apos;t do anything .
you have the right to remain silent .
anything you say can and will be used against ...
so ... renata ellard ?
yes , she &apos;s sweeney &apos;s fiancee .
we can &apos;t represent her .
i &apos;m a witness , and cary &apos;s representing sweeney .
why me ?
he asked for a recommendation .
well , thank you .
i think .
diane , in regard to client poaching ...
oh , please , this one &apos;s pay for play .
you &apos;ll owe me one , okay ?
alicia .
finn .
you &apos;re on the renata ellard case ?
yeah , yeah , i got it last minute .
prosecuting the preliminary hearing .
odd , huh ?
it is . very .
and remember this is a preliminary hearing ,
not a trial .
counselor ...
your witness .
yes , your honor .
mr. rowe , hello .
you were the victim &apos;s boyfriend , is that correct ?
it is .
and you talked with her on the night of the murder ?
yeah , i called morgan .
i didn &apos;t like that she was with her .
you &apos;re nodding toward the accused ,
renata ellard .
and you discussed ...
and you ...
discussed ...
your girlfriend &apos;s intention
to break off her affair with renata .
yeah .
she was scared of her ,
and the way she was obsessing on morgan ...
oh , my god , the lies .
mr. sweeney .
my apologies , your honor . i ...
thank you , your honor .
was renata ellard jealous ?
what do you need ?
forensics , anything you &apos;ve got .
okay , i &apos;m on it .
oh , you might find this useful .
by the way , did morgan
end the relationship with renata that night ?
no , she was afraid of what renata would do .
no more questions .
thank you , counselor .
mr. rowe , um , were you invited to the party by mr. sweeney ?
no , i was not .
in fact , isn &apos;t it true that you attended the party uninvited
after having a heated cell phone argument with your girlfriend ?
it wasn &apos;t heated . she said she was too afraid
of breaking it off with renata .
i was trying to encourage her .
mr. rowe , were you aware that your lover was a practitioner
of the japanese s and m rope practice called shibari ?
yes .
and were you also aware
that she practiced this with renata ellard ?
that was a yes , wasn &apos;t it ?
yes .
good . and , um ,
do you know what this is ?
no .
it &apos;s a liability waiver , signed by your girlfriend .
in case of an accident on the shibari ropes ,
her partner would not be blamed .
objection !
is it really the defense &apos;s contention
that the victim died on the shibari ropes
and then moved herself to the bathroom
to cover up her death ?
i was under the impression i didn &apos;t have to contend .
it &apos;s up to the prosecution to make their case .
yeah ?
hey , zach .
you have a minute ?
uh , what &apos;s going on ?
we want to talk to you .
this ...
... is an intervention .
we are intervening .
we need to discuss ...
the pot .
you gotta be kidding me .
i &apos;m literally the only person in my class
who &apos;s never done any drugs .
oh , is that really true ?
owen .
look , do you want me to pee in a cup or something ?
no one said that ; we just want to ...
what ? protect the family image ?
keep up this facade of perfection like you and dad ?
excuse me ?
you and dad are playing
bill and hillary-- why don &apos;t we talk about that ?
yeah , why don &apos;t we talk about that ?
this isn &apos;t about me
or your father .
anything we do is a family issue .
the florricks is a family business ...
no , zach .
that is not ...
you &apos;re changing the subject .
what is the subject ?
marijuana !
yes .
let me tell you a story
about the abuse of drugs .
the ligature marks on the victim &apos;s neck
did not match the position of the strap .
suggesting that the body was moved , right ?
yes .
were there any other reasons that you concluded
this was not a suicide ?
yes , there were abrasions on the knees and elbows
consistent with a dragging motion .
it appeared as if the body was moved
from the bedroom to the bathroom .
thank you , doctor .
ms. lockhart ?
anything over there or are we done ?
i know , sorry , your honor . yes , um ...
doctor , how familiar are you with shibari ?
how familiar ?
i &apos;ve made myself familiar for this hearing .
good .
what is a canvas ?
i , uh , what is a ...
is that the submissive position in the shibari ritual ?
oh , yeah , yes .
and that is the person being manipulated , right ?
and the dominant position is the rigger , yes ?
yes .
and the dominant rigger
is in the controlling harness here .
the more elaborate harness .
yes , they are the ones in control .
and the harness of the rigger
has a more elaborate front ?
yes . and that harness
is consistent with ...
these bruises ?
doctor , do you have an answer to that question ?
i do .
it is consistent .
so the bruising on the monitor
is on morgan &apos;s body ?
uh , yes .
would you speak up , doctor ?
yes , it is consistent with the victim &apos;s body .
so morgan was the rigger ,
the person controlling the shibari ,
and renata was the canvas .
the one controlled ?
yes .
you wanted to see me ?
how you doing ?
good . how about you ?
it &apos;s odd not just talking with you anymore .
it is .
i was watching you in court .
that was just a preliminary hearing .
i @-@ i know .
i &apos;m thinking of possibly stepping in .
it &apos;s a ... it &apos;s a big case . i don &apos;t want to lose it
on the one yard line .
so i was the sacrificial lamb out there ?
what ?
no prep , dropping a case
into my lap without prep , no warning .
you wanted a reason to step in .
finn , i don &apos;t think this is gonna work out .
well , what &apos;s not working out ? you took me off all of my cases .
you &apos;re still suffering from jeffrey grant ,
and i &apos;m not blaming you ,
but i think you should take some time off .
no , i &apos;m okay .
as your boss , i &apos;m asking you ...
take some time off .
no , but thank you .
i &apos;m not actually asking .
i know you &apos;re not .
but no .
finn , i &apos;m afraid i don &apos;t have any choice .
i &apos;m relieving you of your duties .
actually , you can &apos;t . i &apos;m running .
you ...
yeah . i declared my candidacy today .
against me ?
well , let &apos;s not personalize it . i &apos;m running for state &apos;s attorney ,
but unfortunately ,
it is a shakman violation
if you relieve me from my duty .
you are making a very large mistake .
i want my cases back .
all of them .
hey . alicia , it &apos;s finn .
i need to file now .
congratulations .
yeah , screw him .
okay , go down to the third floor ,
the office of the cook county clerk .
you can file the forms in 20 minutes ,
but you need signatures .
how many ?
7,000 . give me a minute .
i &apos;ll see what i can do .
eli , it &apos;s alicia .
i need 7,000 signatures .
how long will that take ?
cook county or federal ?
cook county .
give me an hour .
your honor , i have one more witness .
you have one more witness ?
what happened to mr. polmar ?
he &apos;s busy on another case .
he asked me to step in .
the state &apos;s attorney ?
he asked the state &apos;s attorney to step in ?
yes , your honor .
i must warn you , mr. state &apos;s attorney ,
i &apos;ve not been impressed with the people &apos;s evidence .
what witness are you calling ?
alicia florrick .
objection .
your honor ,
alicia florrick is counsel to mr. sweeney .
yes , and mr. sweeney is not on trial ;
renata ellard is on trial .
alicia florrick represents the entire sweeney family as well ...
alicia florrick has given statements to the police .
i see no reason why she cannot be called to the stand .
neither can i.
i will grant a subpoena for mrs. florrick .
you had time for a visit in the middle of
this new colin sweeney mess .
i &apos;m impressed .
this time , it &apos;s his fiancee .
well , what can i do for you ?
mr. governor , i ...
i hate to toot my own horn .
oh , toot away .
thank you . since i took over the department ,
our conviction rate has gone up .
i think that speaks to our increased scrutiny over prosecutions .
like jeffrey grant ?
jeffrey grant was a tragedy .
we had an asa who was looking to make his bones .
he overreached .
you want my endorsement ?
yes , i do .
as you know , continuity is very important in this office ,
and this green asa is planning to run against me .
i have the endorsement of the dcc ,
and i intend to do everything i can to win .
jim , do you have a problem with my wife ?
no , no , mr. governor ,
i have no problems with anyone .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m the front runner in this race .
but if you think there is a problem with your wife ,
what better way to show the fairness
of your own administration than by ... endorsing me ?
thanks for dropping by , jim .
thanks for your time .
eli .
jim .
governor .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re thinking , but it &apos;s a mistake .
what &apos;s a mistake ?
the thing you &apos;re thinking that i don &apos;t know what it is .
he &apos;s gonna win .
you want to endorse a winner ,
especially one you appointed to his position .
mrs. florrick .
waiting to be called in ?
can i tell you something before you enter ?
i &apos;d rather you not .
i &apos;m in love .
renata , she means the world to me .
i just want to make sure you don &apos;t remember things incorrectly .
what would &quot; incorrectly &quot; be ?
i don &apos;t know .
something that might endanger my merger .
i know that means
a million @-@ dollar bonus to your firm .
mr. sweeney , i want you to stop right now .
i &apos;m not asking you to lie for me .
it &apos;s just you were so very helpful in getting me off .
the victim objected to renata
taking a seat on the board .
from what i understood ,
ms. donnelly was an animal rights activist
and she objected to the testing practices of the company
mr. sweeney was acquiring .
and renata and morgan fought over it ?
they disagreed .
a heated disagreement ?
spirited .
and what was the outcome of this spirited argument ?
there was no resolution .
thank you .
i realize it must be difficult given that
you represented mr. sweeney in a prev ...
objection , your honor . counselor &apos;s testifying .
yes , cuts down on the need for witnesses . sustained .
no more questions .
mrs. florrick ...
is colin sweeney an important client ?
he is .
and it would hurt your firm &apos;s bottom line if he were in prison ?
objection . relevance .
sustained .
the police first questioned you about mr. sweeney &apos;s
possible involvement in the murder .
yes .
and you claimed that he wasn &apos;t involved .
well , i said that he was within my sight at the time of the murder .
and that &apos;s why the police turned their attention
to my client , renata--
objection .
i &apos;ll withdraw .
you also claimed that you saw demetrius rowe
following the victim upstairs ?
originally , yes .
but then you realized you were wrong .
it was actually barry hildom ,
mr. sweeney &apos;s valet , that you saw ?
yes .
both men are african @-@ american , which caused you some confusion ?
yes , i was distracted .
i corrected the misidentification .
and isn &apos;t it possible that you were wrong
about seeing mr. sweeney at the time of the murder ?
no .
it &apos;s not possible that you were wrong ?
a woman &apos;s freedom depends upon your testimony .
objection . asked and answered .
sustained .
mrs. florrick ...
did colin sweeney approach you before your appearance today
asking you to lie ?
objection , your honor .
no , that i &apos;ll overrule . you may answer .
mrs. florrick , did mr. sweeney ask you to lie ?
he did .
did he suggest his business would disappear if you didn &apos;t lie ?
he did . but i want to make clear
that he has had no impact on my testimony .
really ? so you &apos;re protecting mr. sweeney and damning renata ,
but that has nothing to do
with mr. sweeney trying to bribe your testimony ?
objection , your honor . inflammatory .
sustained .
nothing further to ask this witness , your honor .
so that &apos;s what your little charade was about .
alicia . charade ?
coming to me , suggesting i lie .
i thought it was a bit ham @-@ fisted .
perhaps . i felt very lee j. cobb threatening you .
坚持被告有罪的愤怒的陪审团成员
also , i would look biased on the stand .
yes , clever , wasn &apos;t it ?
ms. lockhart &apos;s idea .
she &apos;s very good , isn &apos;t she ?
i think she &apos;s channeling her old partner .
makes her quite attractive .
did renata do it , or did you ?
now that &apos;s just rude .
why don &apos;t we let the judge decide ?
then we can talk .
you okay ?
am i okay ?
will ?
i am .
i &apos;m sorry .
i know .
me , too .
he made me laugh .
i don &apos;t want to cry anymore , owen , so let &apos;s not .
yep .
wait , so ... you &apos;re bill and hillary now ?
zach &apos;s being melodramatic .
well , what does that mean , exactly , bill and hillary ?
it means we &apos;re married .
we stay married ...
but that &apos;s it .
he does what he wants , you do what you want ?
well , he does what he wants anyway .
interesting .
i thought you &apos;d be happy .
i &apos;m happy if you &apos;re happy .
it &apos;s a decision . i like decisions .
and if you were to ...
i don &apos;t know , meet someone else ,
how would that work ?
that &apos;s really not what this is about .
what is this about ?
i don &apos;t know .
sitting here , drinking my wine ,
working , making dinner for the kids .
oh , god , it &apos;s like mildred pierce .
we need to get you laid .
okay , this conversation &apos;s over .
what ? why ? what &apos;s wrong ? come back .
nope . i &apos;m going in the kitchen .
alicia ...
peter is getting laid ; you should get laid , too .
i don &apos;t want to talk about it .
why not ?
i &apos;m going to bed .
good night .
okay .
i &apos;m sleeping on the couch .
yep .
i care about you , sis .
i know .
you &apos;re my favorite person in the world .
new blood matters to me ,
and as you know , in this office ,
i &apos;m the new blood .
now , in my old office at cook county state &apos;s attorney ,
there are , i think , many fine candidates .
the current holder has done , i think , mostly a good job .
however , my chief of staff has brought my attention
to a new contender .
in fact , he &apos;s even helped to gather signatures for this candidate .
so , in the spirit of new blood ,
i would like to throw my support behind the newest candidate
for the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office ,
and his name is finley polmar .
he has been with the state &apos;s attorney for six months .
he is from new york ,
and i think he brings a lifetime of experience to the job .
thank you .
hello ?
mr. polmar , this is eli gold , chief of staff to the governor .
you &apos;ve just gained his endorsement .
i &apos;d like to arrange a time to hear you campaign plan .
all rise !
thank you .
during the preliminary hearing ,
the prosecution &apos;s evidentiary threshold
is fairly low for a very good reason :
matters should be left to jury .
but the state has an interest in not holding the accused
if the state fails to meet its minimal burden .
i have decided that is what has happened .
sorry , mr. castro .
therefore , there &apos;s a finding of no probable cause .
the defendant can be released .
congratulations , mr. sweeney .
to you , too .
you ladies are quite the team .
we &apos;ll expect you both at the wedding .
wouldn &apos;t miss it .
ready , my blushing bride ?
yes . i &apos;d just like a moment with alicia .
oh , of course . diane ?
you can come by my office
and we &apos;ll draw up the paperwork regarding your board seat .
thank you for saving my marriage .
i didn &apos;t do anything .
when colin and i met , i wondered
what we could possibly have in common .
he &apos;s worldly in a way i could never be .
he &apos;s experienced things i &apos;d only read about .
well , good luck with the wedding planning .
it made me wonder what it would feel like
to watch the life drain from someone &apos;s eyes .
just one of the things colin experienced that i had not .
after this experience , this obstacle ,
colin and i have so much more in common .
i think it &apos;s gonna make for a much stronger marriage .
come on ... killer .
yes , dear .
alicia , please come to our wedding .
help us tie the knot .
oh ! that &apos;s funny , huh ?
