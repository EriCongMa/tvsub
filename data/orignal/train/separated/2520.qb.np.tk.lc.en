welcome to super bowl xlviii
between the seattle seahawks and the denver broncos .
the field is a frozen tundra ,
imported at great expense from alaska .
and the game comes down to this one play--
a final field goal .
the kick is up , it hits the crossbar and--
年度最快乐工作日
* glowing rods , glowing rods *
* it &apos;s making me *
* weak and dizzy ... *
uh , rumor has it they &apos;re about to give out
the company christmas gifts .
who told you that ?

the vp of personnel is doing my girlfriend .
ooh , look at you , mr. connected .
i hope it &apos;s better than last year &apos;s lousy gift .
yeah , what a rip .
ugh . remember this gift ?
the executive stress ball .
one more squeeze and you &apos;re fired .
now i feel more stressed than ever .
excellent .
excellent . excellent .
uh , you don &apos;t look so excellent to me .
ho , ho , humbug .
santa claus approaches to judge and punish .
wow ! a good gift for once .
oogle goggles .
augmented reality glasses .
you wear them like eyeglasses , but inside the lens ,
you see information about the people and places around you .
ooh , finally i &apos;m not a slave to my stupid human eyeballs .
老式lex @-@ 1963型
glasses , call lenny .

体育运动仅限于拽糖果机把手
hm . i always thought it was &quot; simp @-@ sen . &quot;
really ? don &apos;t you ever look up at the sky ?
always wondered what that was .
sir , i &apos;m concerned about your sudden generosity .
the doctor said to bring you in right away
if you display kindness or warmth .
oh , don &apos;t worry .
this santa still has claws .
as of now , each of those nuclear nitwits
is wearing a video camera .
with a direct feed to me .
you &apos;re spying on them ?
smithers , how much did this company lose
to office supply theft last year ?
$ 7,043 .
yes , well , no more of that .
thanks to this $ 26 million surveillance system .
beware , rabbits .
i spy with my transplanted eyes .
oh , and i forgot to show you the best feature .
each of these buttons represents an employee .
when i press it , he or she dies .
what &apos;s wrong with this thing ?
now , remember kids ,
the school says you must have a valentine card
for everyone in your class .
how does this mean anything when everyone &apos;s forced to do it ?
what did i say about pointing out
the meaninglessness of things ?
not to .
well , no way i &apos;m giving a valentine to nelson .
he &apos;s a bully , and i do not love him .
jesus says to love your enemies .
that &apos;s because jesus knows one day ,
he gets to look his enemies in the eye and say
&quot; it was me who sent you to hell . &quot;
bart , your school requires you
to give everyone a valentine card
in an envelope with a fun sticker .
your teacher put out an e @-@ mail alert .
with a video attachment .
welcome to firstline . tonight ,
&quot; valentine &apos;s day : always a massacre . &quot;
at this school , children may give valentines
to whomever they choose .
danny is unpopular ,
due to rumors he sleeps in the raw with his ma and his pa .
human young are born with the ability to count valentines ,
and danny realizes he &apos;s been snubbed .
past generations of children were used to rejection .
but today &apos;s kids , raised in a climate of video games
and instant messaging , are fragile weirdos .
on february 15 , 2 : 00 am ,
after checking the mailbox one last time ,
danny nearly died from an overdose
of little candy hearts .
many of history &apos;s monsters never received a valentine .
attila the hun , mao tse @-@ tung ,
and me , will lyman .

this is firstline .
fine , nelson gets a valentine .

i &apos;m watching videos of idiots wearing these glasses
and not paying attention to the world around them .
look at these jerks .
i don &apos;t understand what &apos;s so great about these
state of the art , solar @-@ powered , computo @-@ glasses .
i &apos;ll let you try them on ,
right after i decide if these videos are funny or die .
funny , funny , die , die ,
funny , funny but the guy died .
now , a simple sunday drive will reveal the hidden wonders
of our hometown .

springfield city hall was built for the spencer tracy movie

it was just a flat wall with nothing behind it for 30 years .
dad , bart &apos;s on my side of the seat .
dad , lisa &apos;s my little sister .
the rearview mirror was invented in 1911,
for just this reason .

pause for sweet talk .
oh , glasses , you &apos;re so wonderful .

glasses , take me two minutes back in time .
marge .

are a radical new technology
and should be worn in moderation .
isn &apos;t that right , glasses ?
yes , just like i told you .
anyway , i &apos;m giving them up .
to whoever dares take them .
yoink .

巧克力焦糖布朗尼 花生酱布朗尼

ooh . so many choices , maggie .
um , mr. burns , sir ?
can i get another pair of glasses ?
maybe two pair ? one for the beach house ?
can i also get a beach house ?
two beach houses .
monitors ? !
what the ... ?
burns gave us those glasses so he could spy on us !
this is a violation of our human rights .
okay ,
so let &apos;s see what we can see .
solitaire , top hats on ebay ,
angry birds fan fiction ,
guy doing really easy crossword puzzle ,
lenny doing carl &apos;s clown makeup ...
someone &apos;s actually working ?
maggie ? !

what about a valentine that says : &quot; bully , for you &quot; ?
hmm , interesting .
&quot; interesting &quot; means &quot; no . &quot;
&quot; interesting &quot; means &quot; no . &quot;
milhouse , you &apos;re a genius !
i am ? what did i say ?
oh , nothing .
on tv when a guy says something lame ,
another guy says he &apos;s a genius ,
and then he has an idea .
i thought it might work for me .
well , you called me a genius .
that means a lot .
oh , i hate this stupid holiday !
the only thing you can do is screw it up .
that &apos;s it !
bart , you &apos;re a genius !
well , if you keep throwing the word around , it means nothing .
who are you ?
mr. burns !
oh . i &apos;m so sorry , mr. burns .
i won &apos;t bother you again .
marge , that &apos;s a &quot; compact only &quot; space .
well ... who knew you were such a rebel ?
now let &apos;s learn more about my wife &apos;s secret life .
secrets which can only be good .
hi , marge .
dr. carlock is ready for you .
thank you .
so , marge , how have you been ?
okay , i guess .
marge is in therapy ? !
oh , i hate when i come here
and the first word out of my mouth is &quot; homer . &quot;
but here we go , again .
homer was converting our dollars to &quot; yu @-@ ros . &quot;
not the money , the sandwich .
and has there been any improvement in homer &apos;s drinking ?
well , he &apos;s down to two beers in the shower .
they &apos;re pale ales ! please !
well , maybe if you just concentrate on one problem ,
like his temper .
oh , everything in the newspaper makes him mad .
not marmaduke ! never marmaduke !
marmaduke was horrible today !
also , marge is in therapy ,
and she didn &apos;t even tell me .
whoa . she has crossed a line .
how did you find out ?
spied on her with a hidden camera .
she thinks i &apos;m selfish .
she thinks i don &apos;t spend enough time with the kids .
well , that &apos;s crazy . come on .
you work your butt off in a radioactive hellhole ,
and what do you get ? not one lousy superpower .
i guess the only choice is to come clean with her
and tell her what i know , and how i know .
whoa , whoa !
bad idea . no , no .
chicks do not like finding out they &apos;re being spied on .
i speak from loooooong ....
experience .
no , you got to make it seem like
you found out by accident there .
next week you schedule an appointment
with the therapist after hers , and then you bump into midge
in the waiting room there .
moe , that &apos;s great !
: how do you get your ideas ?
pretty much all my friends are divorced guys .
hello , homie !
dinner &apos;s almost ready .
pork chops with my secret seasoning .
yeah , you do like your secrets , don &apos;t you , marge ?
don &apos;t lose your cool , homer .
the building block of a marriage is long silence .
hey , where &apos;d she go ?
good , good , you held your tongue there .
because-- hey , where &apos;d you go ?
doesn &apos;t anybody want me to give &apos; em advice ?
okay there , fido , when you see that squirrel outside ,
at first you play it cool , you understand ?
&quot; i fear you &quot; ?
this is what valentine &apos;s day means to you ? !
this is what it means to everyone .
how can you be forced to say &quot; i love you &quot; ?
people only give valentines because they &apos;re scared
of what would happen if they didn &apos;t .
&quot; nelson , you frighten me so ,
&quot; the psycho @-@ est bully i know ,
&quot; you &apos;re a sociopath in need of a bath ,
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll wind up on death row . &quot;
mmm ! you can really smell the fear on this .
i rubbed it on milhouse .
simpson , you just touched my heart &apos;s butt .
why are you hugging yourself ?
why are you hugging yourself ? !
if nelson doesn &apos;t do something bully @-@ ish in two seconds ,
i &apos;m gonna wedgie him .
nelson doesn &apos;t wear underwear .
wow . always one step ahead .
uh , i &apos;m here to check in for the 3 : 00 .
please fill out these forms , mr. fakinami .
no , it &apos;s &quot; fake name . &quot;
i &apos;ll just call you elias .
that &apos;s &quot; alias . &quot;
finally .
time for the big bump @-@ into .
same time next week , marge ?
oh , absolutely .
these sessions keep me on an even keel .
dr. carlock is like my wednesday reset button .
wednesday ?
okay , she &apos;s always in a good mood after therapy .
oh , my god .
marge needs this .
it lights her way through the dark path of marriage to me .
come on in , mr. fakinami .
no need . everything &apos;s fine .
i &apos;m sorry , but there are no cancellations within 24 hours .
well , as long as i &apos;m paying for the time ...
ow ! where &apos;d you learn to cut hair ?
you know , you have some anger issues .
more snip , less lip .
oh , i forgot to tell you , homie ,
i bumped into helen lovejoy today , and guess what ?
i don &apos;t need to know , marge .
you deserve to have your secrets .
it &apos;s not a secret . it &apos;s a funny story .
okay , marge , but first , well ...
i have something i need to tell you .
something i did you might be mad about , and rightly so .
oh , i bet my story &apos;s more interesting .
whoo @-@ hoo ! i tried !
okay . okay ,
so , helen lovejoy told me that
she made her famous snickerdoodle bundt cake for the church sale ,
and she put in salt instead of sugar !
yeah ? and ... ?
that &apos;s it . that was the story .
where &apos;s that cake now ?
it got sold .
who bought it ?
dr. hibbert .
excuse me . i have to make a call .
don &apos;t take too long .
okay , hibbert &apos;s in surgery ,
but they &apos;re having him paged .
wait , something &apos;s wrong .
that &apos;s better .
oh , dear god .
hi , ralph . um , i just wanted to tell you ,
there was a tooth in the valentine you gave me .
plant it and you &apos;ll grow a new ralph .
i don &apos;t need a new ralph . i like the old one .
happy valentine &apos;s day .
well , better get ready for st. patrick &apos;s !
