henry &apos;s fine .
that &apos;s not what i asked you .

really . he &apos;s his normal self .
regina won &apos;t keep you separated forever .
when people are supposed to be together ,
they find a way .
yeah .
so he &apos;s his normal self . he &apos;s fine .
he &apos;s happy ?
yes .
no .
he misses you a lot .
trust me . i &apos;m with him , like , six hours a day .
six hours ?
you take newborns ?
&apos;cause i &apos;d love six hours off .
ashley .
i didn &apos;t--i didn &apos;t even recognize you .
oh . baby on the outside ?
how &apos;s it going ?
it &apos;s , uh ...
it &apos;s , uh ...
i mean , the baby &apos;s great , but , uh ,
we really haven &apos;t had time to do the whole getting married thing .
so that &apos;s been rough ,
and sean &apos;s been working double shifts at the cannery .
well , he has to work .
on valentine &apos;s day ? yeah .
he couldn &apos;t get out of it .
i &apos;m sorry . that sucks .
it doesn &apos;t have to .
come out with me . let &apos;s have a girls &apos; night .
we can all go . mary margaret , emma , too ,
if you leave the badge at home .
i &apos;m not really in the party mood ,
but you guys can all go and have fun .
what &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s the station .
something &apos;s up .
sheriff swan .
your neiborr saw your front door open .
they called it in .
it appears i &apos;ve been robbed .
funny how that keeps happening to you .
yeah , well ...
i &apos;m a difficult man to love .
uh , where-- where are you taking me ?
let &apos;s call it ... your room .
my room ?
well , it sounds a lot nicer than &quot; dungeon . &quot;
no !
hey ! you can &apos;t just leave me in here !
hello ? hello ?
you will serve me my meals ,
and you will clean the dark castle .
i @-@ i understand .
you will dust my collection and launder my clothing .
yes .
you will fetch me fresh straw when i &apos;m spinning at the wheel .
got it .
oh . and you will skin the children i hunt for their pelts .
that one was a quip . not serious .
right .
my . i &apos;m so sorry , but , uh ...
it &apos;s ... it &apos;s chipped .
you--you can hardly see it .
oh , it &apos;s just a cup .
sheriff swan , you can go now .
i know exactly what was taken and who did it .
i &apos;ve got it from here .
no , you don &apos;t .
this was a robbery . public menace .
and if you don &apos;t tell me what you know ,
i &apos;ll have to arrest you for obstruction of justice .
i have a feeling you don &apos;t want to be behind bars .
indeed not .
all right , his name &apos;s moe french .
he sells flowers . he recently defaulted on a loan .
a short time ago ,
we had a little disagreement over collateral .
okay . i &apos;ll go get him , check him out .
i &apos;m sure you will , assuming i don &apos;t find him ...
let &apos;s just say bad things tend to happen to bad people .
is that a threat ?
observation .
good luck .
why do you spin so much ?
sorry . it &apos;s just ...
you &apos;ve spun straw into more gold than you could ever spend .
i like to watch the wheel .
helps me forget .
forget what ?
i guess it worked .
what are you doing ?
opening these . it &apos;s almost spring .
we should let some light in .
what did you do ? nail them down ?
yes .
um ... thank you .
thank you .
it &apos;s no matter .
i &apos;ll , uh , put the curtains back up .
there &apos;s no need . i &apos;ll get used to it .
you &apos;re welcome . you &apos;re right .
your man moe ripped you off .
it was all still at his place .
and the man himself ?
closing in on him .
so job well half @-@ done then .
in less than a day , i got everything back .
is something wrong ?
you &apos;ve recovered nothing .
there &apos;s something missing .
i &apos;ll get it when i find him .
not if i find him first .
why did you want me here ?
the place was filthy .
i think you were lonely .
i mean , any man would be lonely .
i &apos;m not a man .
so i &apos;ve had a couple of months to look around , you know .
and , uh , upstairs ,
there &apos;s , uh , clothing , small ,
as if for a @-@ a child ?
was it yours or ...
or was there a son ?
there was .
there was a son .
i lost him ...
as i did his mother .
i &apos;m ... i &apos;m sorry .
so you--you were a man once .
an ordinary man .
if i &apos;m never going to know another person in my whole life ,
can &apos;t i at least know you ?
perhaps ...
perhaps you just want to learn the monster &apos;s weaknesses .
you &apos;re not a monster .
you think you &apos;re uglier than you are .
that &apos;s why you cover all the mirrors up , isn &apos;t it ?
i am sir gaston ,
and you , beast , have taken--
who was that ?
just an old woman selling flowers .
here .
if you &apos;ll have it .
why , thank you .
you had a life , belle ,
before ... this--
friends ... family .
what made you choose to come here with me ?
heroism .
sacrifice .
you know , there aren &apos;t a lot of opportunities
for women in this land to-- to show what they can do ,
to see the world , to be heroes .
so when you arrived ,
that was my chance .
i always wanted to be brave .
i figured , do the brave thing and ...
bravery would follow .
and is it everything you hoped ?
i did want to see the world .
that part didn &apos;t really work out .
but , uh ...
i did save my village .
and what about your , uh ...
betrothed ?
it was an arranged marriage .
honestly , i never really cared much for gaston .
you know , to me , love is ...
love is layered .
love is a ...
a mystery to be uncovered .
yeah , i could never truly give my heart
to someone as superficial as he .
but , um , you were going to tell me about your son .
i &apos;ll tell you what .
i &apos;ll make you a deal .
go to town ...
and fetch me some straw .
when you return ,
i &apos;ll share my tale .
but ...
you ... town ?
you-- you trust me to come back ?
oh , no .
i expect i &apos;ll never see you again .
pace yourself , ashley .
i am .
this is the first night out since i &apos;ve had the baby .
i am making up for lost time .
ash , check out those guys .
honey , i &apos;m still with sean .
you &apos;re not married , and he &apos;s not here .
he &apos;s working .
he &apos;s always working .
have fun moping .
she &apos;s right .
he is always working .
i thought love would be different .
me , too .
two valentines .
sounds like a complicated life .
oh , no , i- i just couldn &apos;t decide .
these are both for the same woman ?
well , they &apos;re both so ... us .
i see .
well , you &apos;re fortunate you have someone that loves you .
i really am .
love .
it &apos;s like a delicate flame .
and once it &apos;s gone ,
it &apos;s gone forever .
best of luck to you .
thanks .
oh , bless you .
ah . thank you .
walk .
now you see , here &apos;s the thing--
i don &apos;t normally let people get away .
did my carriage splash you ?
oh . oh , no , i &apos;m-- i &apos;m fine .
you know , i &apos;m tired of riding .
let me stretch my legs and walk with you for a spell .
you carry very little .
i don &apos;t want to be slowed down .
you &apos;re running from someone .
the question is , master or lover ?
master and lover .
i might take a rest .
you-- you go on ahead .
so if i &apos;m right ,
you love your employer ,
but you &apos;re leaving him .
i might love him .
i mean , i could , except ...
something evil has taken root in him .
sounds like a curse to me .
and all curses can be broken .
a kiss born of true love would do it .
oh , child , no .
i would never suggest a young woman
to kiss a man who held her captive .
what kind of message is that ?
right .
besides , if he loves you , he would &apos;ve let you go .
and if he doesn &apos;t love you ,
well , then the kiss won &apos;t even work .
well , he did let me go .
yes , but no kiss happened .
and a kiss-- a kiss is enough ?
he &apos;d be a man again ?
an ordinary man .
true love &apos;s kiss
will break any curse .
oh , you &apos;re back already .
good .
good thing .
i &apos;m , uh , i &apos;m nearly out of straw .
come on . you &apos;re happy that i &apos;m back .
i &apos;m not unhappy .
and , uh ,
you promised me a story .
did i ?
tell me about your son .
i lost him .
there &apos;s nothing more to tell , really .
and since then ,
you &apos;ve loved no one ,
and no one has loved you .
why did you come back ?
i wasn &apos;t going to .
but then ...
something changed my mind .
what &apos;s happening ?
kiss me again . it &apos;s working .
what is ?
any curse can be broken .
who told you that ? !
who knows that ? !
i @-@ i @-@ i don &apos;t know . she , uh ...
she--she--
&quot; she . &quot;
you ... evil ... soul .
this was you !
you turned her against me !
you think you can make me weak ?
you think you can defeat me ? !
who are you talking to ?
the queen !
your friend , the queen .
how did she get to you ?
the--the queen ? i don &apos;t--
i knew this was a trick .
i knew you could never care for me .
oh , yeah .
you &apos;re working for her .
or is this all you ?
is this you being the hero and killing the beast ?
it was working--
shut up !
this means it &apos;s true love !
shut the hell up !
why won &apos;t you believe me ? !
because no one--
no one could ever , ever love me !
let me explain . okay ?
let me explain .
well , that is ... fascinating .
truly fascinating .
i &apos;m gonna let you breathe in a second ,
and you &apos;re gonna say two sentences .
the first is gonna tell me where it is .
the second is gonna tell me who told you to take it .
do you understand the rules ?
yeah .
good . let &apos;s begin .
i needed that van .
now you see , that is not a good first sentence .
oh ! gold !
listen .
tell me where it is !
stop .
tell me where it is !
oh , stop !
it wasn &apos;t my fault .
&quot; my fault &quot; ?
what are you talking about , &quot; my fault &quot; ?
you shut her out .
you had her love and you shut her out !
she &apos;s gone .
she &apos;s gone forever .
she &apos;s not coming back .
and it &apos;s your fault !
not mine !
you are her father !
yours ! it &apos;s yours !
it &apos;s your fault ! it &apos;s your fault !
stop .
girls &apos; night &apos;s really working out for you .
i thought it would make me feel better .
but the truth is ...
i need a &quot; be with my guy &quot; night .
but he &apos;s never around .
and i &apos;m at home with the baby all day .
i mean , what &apos;s the point of being together
if we &apos;re not together ?
i get it .
loving someone you can &apos;t be with ...
it &apos;s a terrible , terrible burden .
look , this was a bad idea .
i should--i should go home .
ashley .
sean ?
hey .
i thought that you were working tonight .
i am . it &apos;s my break ,
and i had to see you ...
and ask you something .
will you marry me ?
i only have a 20 @-@ minute break , so , um ,
anytime now .
yes !
my truck &apos;s outside if you want to take a ride
before i head back to work .
it &apos;s not much of a date .
it &apos;s the best date .
then your carriage awaits .
get in .
how &apos;s girls &apos; night ?
david ?
what are you doing here ?
i knew you &apos;d be here ,
and i , uh ,
i wanted to give you your valentine &apos;s day card .
check up on me ?
maybe a little .
i didn &apos;t want you finding somebody else .
like you ?
&quot; kathryn , i woof you . &quot;
no . i &apos;m so sorry .
i meant ...
i meant this one .
i @-@ i @-@ i always thought
that if two people were supposed to be together ,
they &apos;d find a way .
but , david , if this is our way ,
i think we should find another one .
mary margaret ...
i think you should go home to kathryn .
i know .
you &apos;re right .
but it doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;m gonna give up .
we &apos;ll find that way .
i hope so .
happy valentine &apos;s day .
happy valentine &apos;s day .
so i heard you managed not to break anything he needs .
you &apos;re lucky , mr. gold .
you got a funny definition of &quot; lucky . &quot;
you have a funny definition of &quot; justice . &quot;
what did he really do ?
he stole .
that reaction was about more than taking a few trinkets .
you said something about how he hurt &quot; her , &quot;
what happened to &quot; her &quot; ? who was that ?
what did he do ?
if someone needs help , maybe i can help .
no . i &apos;m sorry , sheriff . i think you heard that wrong .
you really don &apos;t want to cooperate .
look , we &apos;re done here .
actually ...
we &apos;re not .
you &apos;re under arrest .
so ...
what are you going to do to me ?
go .
go ?
i don &apos;t want you anymore , dearie .
you know , you were freeing yourself .
you could &apos;ve had happiness
if you just believed that someone could want you .
but you couldn &apos;t take the chance .
that &apos;s a lie .
you &apos;re a coward , rumplestiltskin .
and no matter how thick you make your skin ,
that doesn &apos;t change .
i &apos;m not a coward , dearie .
it &apos;s quite simple , really .
my power ...
means more to me than you .
no .
no , it doesn &apos;t .
you just don &apos;t think i can love you .
now you &apos;ve made your choice .
and you &apos;re going to regret it .
forever .
and all you &apos;ll have ...
is an empty heart ...
and a chipped cup .
pastrami .
you want half ?
you know i still owe you that favor .
nice , fatty pastrami .
delicious way to clear the books .
well , i don &apos;t need a reminder that you owe me a favor .
and when the day comes that i make my request ,
it &apos;ll be for more than half a sandwich .
sheriff swan ?
i &apos;m letting you have 30 minutes with henry .
take him out . buy him ice cream .
you want me to leave you alone with a prisoner ?
29.1 / 2 minutes .
hi , emma .
hey .
bring me back a cone .
just this once .
come on . let &apos;s go .
you really wanted that little chat , didn &apos;t you ?
apparently , this is the only way i could do it .
please .
sit .
now when two people both want something the other has ,
a deal can always be struck .
do you have what i want ?
yes .
so ...
you did put him up to it , then .
i merely suggested that ...
strong men take what they need .
oh , yeah , and you told him
just exactly what to take , didn &apos;t you ?
we used to know each other so well , mr. gold .
has it really come down to this ?
it seems it has , yeah .
but you know what i want .
what is it you want ?
i want you to answer one question .
and answer it simply .
what &apos;s your name ?
it &apos;s mr. gold .
your real name .
every moment i &apos;ve spent on this earth , that &apos;s been my name .
but what about moments spent elsewhere ?
what are you asking me ?
i think you know .
if you want me to return what &apos;s yours ,
tell me your name .
rumplestiltskin .
now give me what i want .
such hostility .
oh , yeah .
over this ?
such a ... sentimental little keepsake .
thank you ...
your majesty .
so ...
now that we &apos;re being honest with each other ,
let &apos;s remember how things used to be , shall we ?
and don &apos;t let these bars fool you , dear .
i &apos;m the one with the power around here .
i &apos;m gonna be out of here in no time ,
and nothing between us will change .
we shall see .
flimsy locks .
i have a deal to discuss .
a certain ... mermaid .
i &apos;m not dealing today .
are you angry with me ?
what is it this time ?
your little deception failed .
you &apos;ll never be more powerful than me .
you can keep trying , dearie ,
but you &apos;re never gonna beat me .
is this about that girl i met on the road ?
what was her name ?
margie ?
verna ?
belle .
right .
well , you can rest assured i had nothing to do with that tragedy .
what tragedy ?
you don &apos;t know ?
after she got home ...
her fiance had gone missing .
and after her stay here ,
her ...
&quot; association &quot; with you ,
no one would want her , of course .
her father shunned her ,
cut her off , shut her out .
so she needs ...
a home ?
he was cruel to her .
he locked her in a tower
and sent in clerics to cleanse her soul
with scourges and flaying .
after a while , she threw herself off the tower .
she died .
you &apos;re lying .
am i ?
we &apos;re done .
fine .
i have other calls to make .
the place is looking dusty , rumple .
you should get a new girl .
pretty .
well , i know how hard you work .
has anyone been to see her ?
no , ma &apos;am .
not today .
not ever .
