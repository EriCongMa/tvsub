恶心 变态 滚
第七局出现投菊事件 比赛遭破坏
周三是校园投菊事件纪念日
let &apos;s settle down !
guys , what is known ...
what &apos;s known is that around noon yesterday ,
an unidentified student dropped a coin
in another student &apos;s , you know , upper buttock fold .
yes , yes .
gwen ridley , greendale gazette .
is this the return of the ass crack bandit ?
okay , that person , gwen , if he ever existed ,
stopped being active over a year ago .
yeah .
tim briggs , greendale mirror .
is it true that after the attack ,
you received a letter from the ass crack bandit ?
i never said that , tim ,
and when did we split the gazette from the mirror ?
and how many photographs do you people need ?
raul lopez , las noticias hispanicas de greendale .
will this affect soccer ?
we did , in fact , receive a letter an hour after the incident
including details not known to the public
about the brand of garrett &apos;s underwear .
hanes his ways .
&quot; i am the ass crack bandit .
&quot; humans make better banks than piggies .
&quot; whenever i get more change at the store ,
&quot; i can &apos;t wait to drop it down your butts .
&quot; i think i will go to the bank and get so much change
&quot; and take all my dollars and make them into change
and drop it all down there . &quot;
he should be called &quot; the run @-@ on sentence bandit . &quot;
from this moment , people , we are at defcon 4 ...
if that &apos;s the highest defcon ,
and if high defcons are worse than low ones .
ah , you all remember psychology professor duncan .
hey , buddy . where &apos;d you go ?
i was taking care of my sick mother .
she &apos;s still alive , but i &apos;ve put in my time .
britta .
oh , pierce , good for you .
i always thought that hairpiece was a bit cowardly .
duncan is going to help us
work up something called a &quot; profile , &quot;
so we can root this student out .
for the record ,
i tried to get something done about this two years ago .
this is not about you , annie . this is about the school .
this is the biggest p.r. crisis to hit greendale
since we held that rally protesting the wrong korea .
jeffrey , how can you help ?
i &apos;ll take a look at the whole picture ,
see if any pieces match up .
double fruit bonus .
crikey ! kiwi combo , mate .
i took a map of the campus and
pinpointed all the locations of the ass crack bandit strikes .
you can &apos;t handle the fruit .
during the bandit &apos;s most daring spree ,
he cracked three people in a row .
today , i sprinted between all three sites .
my quickest time was 20 minutes .
the a.c.b. did it in 10 .
so he &apos;s got long legs .
i think he has something i don &apos;t ... a shortcut .
the faculty lounge .
you think the bandit &apos;s a teacher ?
the dean &apos;s not gonna help me pursue this .
i need help .
pineapple penalty , fool !
no ! unfair and racist .
look , no way , annie .
look , the faculty already hates me ,
and the dean signs my paychecks .
but this is important !
i can assure you that &apos;s not true .
fruit , fruit , fruit , fruit , fruit !
collect the seeds , sucka !
after the tone , please leave a message .
hey , abed . lab ran late .
what &apos;d annie get us for dinner ?
i hope it &apos;s not salad again .
i &apos;d rather just stop at the meat store .
all right . talk to you later .
well , hello .
will you stop with the cups and the blankets ?
this is how they comfort victims in movies .
okay , i am hereby banning change from this campus .
you really think that &apos;s an effective ...
well , guess what , your two cents is change ,
and it &apos;s banned .
got something .
frankie , somebody get me a bag .
oh , give me that .
&quot; i hope you enjoyed my work again .
you can &apos;t stop me , because what are you gonna do ,
not have butts ? . &quot;
dean , i think it &apos;s a teacher .
i beg your what ?
i have evidence that shows ...
yeah , and i have evidence that shows i &apos;m not listening .
exhibit &quot; a , &quot; exhibit &quot; b. &quot; la la la la la la .
this is never gonna end
if you keep choosing politics over justice .
okay , you want to make trouble ?
go to parker brothers . you &apos;re out .
take it easy .
taking it easy is how troy ended up
with a quarter of a buck in his crack .
annie , nobody &apos;s asking you to do this ...
jeff , come on ! you know how this school works .
we do it , or it doesn &apos;t get done .
the men on our coins understood that .
maybe the ass crack bandit &apos;s point
is that we &apos;re letting our values slide .
or maybe he &apos;s a frat boy coming from the laundromat .
the important question is &quot; who cares ? &quot;
look ,
let me know what you need from me ...
on the down low . way down low .
... and no squealing .
okay , squeal .
real neil here ,
five days into the return of the ass crack bandit .
it &apos;s alive !
since we last spoke ,
three more victims have caught the quarter ,
with no end in sight .
safety pants , 100 bucks a pop .
all sandwiches $ 5 .
sorry , no change . blame the bandit .
here &apos;s a song that &apos;s been shooting up the request line
faster than coins are dropping .
* it said quarter to five , but it was quarter to ass *
* you thought your plumbing was safe *
* but your jeans were half @-@ mast *
* another coin down the drain *
* now , that &apos;s some change that won &apos;t last *
the nature of the ass crack bandit &apos;s crimes
would suggest that he &apos;s angry or just fell in love .
we know that he hates money or loves it
or doesn &apos;t care about money and hates butts or loves them .
abed , you &apos;re special .
can &apos;t you just stand at the scene of the crime
and see what happened ?
i see a man ...
using a social disorder as a procedural device .
wait , wait , wait , i see another man .
mildly autistic super detectives everywhere .
basic cable , broadcast networks .
pain . painful writing .
it hurts .
okay , ooh , la la . hickey , what have you got ?
heartburn . it doesn &apos;t help me catch criminals .
okay . i didn &apos;t want to take drastic measures ,
but i &apos;ve cooked up a little something .
chang ?
you better put a quarter in that crack , mr. bandit .
professor hickey .
gotcha !
whoa ! ha , what do you think ?
i think this is spending too much money on a crime
that nets you 25 cents a pop .
ah , no , no . this was free .
then i think you just admitted you already owned a fake butt .
&quot; i am the mad hatter , if hats were butts .
i am neither left nor right . i am the space between .
to me , you &apos;re all like ants
marching to class , freaks on parade . &quot;
i mean , why mix metaphors ? ants don &apos;t have butts .
wait a minute .
ants do have butts .
no .
these are dave lyrics .
dave ?
dave matthews .
hard @-@ core fans call him dave .
oh , excuse me for being alive in the &apos; 90s
and having two ears connected to a heart .
okay , so all we need to do is assemble a list
of which greendale teachers are dave matthews fans .
guess we better get to work .
背影音乐 巴赫 「 g弦上的咏叹调 」
done .
thought that would take longer .
在图书馆找了一宿
so please approve the dean &apos;s new security measure
called &quot; troy &apos;s law , &quot;
because a camera in the bathroom ...
is better than a quarter in your butt .
as we &apos;ve seen , the ass crack bandit
can be defeated by using the three &quot; b &quot; s :
belts , briefs , and buddies . good .
the bandit always gets his victims when they &apos;re alone .
bend over with friends over .
there &apos;s safety in numbers .
i got cracked !
he &apos;s under the bleachers !
everyone remain calm , please !
all right , free @-@ for @-@ all !
where you been ?
i questioned guterman . we can cross him off .
at the time of the first cracking ,
he was chaperoning greendale &apos;s science dance .
the student that attended can vouch for him .
i checked out mrs. plimpton .
airtight alibi . she &apos;s dead .
next on my list is this one .
bublitz . we &apos;re close , i can feel it .
this extra long churro tastes good in my real mouth .
may i help you ?
we &apos;d like to ask you a few questions if that &apos;s okay .
he &apos;s bolting !
he &apos;s there !
if you &apos;re going to confiscate this , know one thing .
it &apos;s a mild , kind sativa , perfect for playing guitar .
there &apos;s been another ...
what the hell ?
destroying classrooms ?
secretly investigating teachers behind my back ?
someone has to investigate the faculty ,
but you &apos;re like a single @-@ celled organism ... no nerve .
annie , you &apos;re suspended .
you can &apos;t do that !
don &apos;t tell me what i can &apos;t do .
what do you think you are ,
cosmo &apos;s july quiz ?
she was trying to help you .
let me ask you two something .
let me be , like , the 50th person at this school to ask ,
what is this , huh ?
what is this creepy business ?
what ?
i think you two like to partner up on cutesy capers
so you can hold hands in the dark
and address your urges in semi @-@ acceptable scenarios .
whoa , not cool !
you not cool ! you unprofessional !
i &apos;m punishing you , jeffrey .
starting next week ,
you are the new coach of the water polo team .
what ?
that &apos;s right .
every morning , in the water ...
craig pelton , dean and assistant water polo coach .
what ?
this is the ass crack bandit .
i find it funny that you ever thought you could catch me .
oh , that &apos;s very interesting . please continue .
i &apos;ve enjoyed our game of cat and mouse .
it &apos;s funny how close your two little helpers came to catching me .
i liked watching them run in circles .
although sometimes i wonder ,
are they chasing me as an excuse to get near each other ?
i mean , get a room already .
we &apos;re friends !
why don &apos;t you tell us where you are , and we &apos;ll discuss it ?
i am the bringer of change .
i am the filler of cracks .
oh , that &apos;s very interesting . i myself was in 4h .
trace the call , rhonda !
this means trace the call !
look at the extension .
594 . okay .
tracing ...
tracing .
got it , the stables ! we have stables ?
let &apos;s go .
creepy .
i don &apos;t know .
add some doilies and a foot bath ,
and this is my mom &apos;s house .
mush ! mush !
mush ! yah ! mush !
no , run . mush !
starburns ?
since faking his death to escape meth charges ,
alex &quot; starburns &quot; osbourne has been living in the stables ,
eating garbage , and trying to build a cat car .
he &apos;s also confessed to dropping coins
down exposed butt cracks . case closed .
high five ?
sure .
no .
oh , american high five . sorry .
so much pain .
but now it &apos;s time to heal !
you &apos;re all invited to the official
&quot; we caught the ass crack bandit &quot; dance tonight in the cafeteria !
jeff !
there &apos;s no way starburns did it .
innocent people don &apos;t confess .
are you kidding me ?
you knew it was a teacher . you know that doesn &apos;t add up .
maybe i was wrong .
or maybe the dean was right about us .
what ? no .
annie , i took this case because i wanted to help you .
then what is this ?
it &apos;s platonic shoulder holding .
look .
leonard , hello , how are you ?
it &apos;s a guy who puts quarters down butt cracks , jeff .
let &apos;s just let it go .
we can do better .
change is money !
what are you guys , millionaires ?
t @-@ shirts here ! cracked but not broken , huh ?
who &apos;s in ? t @-@ shirts !
t @-@ shirts here ! 20 bucks .
professor duncan ?
yeah ?
not going to the dance ?
i &apos;ll go later .
oh , actually , would you mind coming and getting me
when britta &apos;s drunk ?
listen , as britta &apos;s friend , i should give you this ad ...
yes ! that is my jam right there .
dave matthews fan ?
obviously you &apos;re not .
real fans call him dave .
bum bum bum
i &apos;ve heard this song before . hey , winger , who is this ?
what are you talking about ? you don &apos;t know who this is ?
i remember it from the &apos; 90s .
* hee haw haw haw hee haw haw *
it &apos;s dave .
lee roth ?
you &apos;re not the ass crack bandit .
shh ! keep it down , huh ? i made a deal with the dean .
he said as long as i confessed ,
he &apos;d let me slide on the meth stuff ,
and then he &apos;d buy me a space heater for my stable .
yeah , but why call the dean and pretend that ...
i didn &apos;t call no dean .
i don &apos;t call nobody don &apos;t call me .
i got to go backstage once and meet the whole band ,
everyone ... except dave .
there &apos;s a whole album of photos online if you go to ...
you actually wouldn &apos;t be able to access it .
i use an older , british form of facebook
called &quot; mug @-@ scroll . &quot;
i guess i should be going .
no , no , stay .
we &apos;re just getting to know each other .
i really shouldn &apos;t , i have a ...
oopsie .
aren &apos;t you going to pick those up ?
yes .
just ... reach down with your hand and ...
bye .
this is the ass crack bandit .
i find it funny that you ever thought you could catch me .
jeff .
it &apos;s duncan .
annie ?
jeff ?
very nice .
oh , bloody hell ,
my shoe is untied by british standards .
here we go .
one bunny , two bunnies .
oh ! get britta !
annie ! did duncan get cracked ?
where &apos;s the bandit ? do you see him ?
over there !
come on , let &apos;s get him !
shirley , what are you doing ?
looking for you .
did you see someone come this way ?
jeff , annie , pierce is dead .
tonight &apos;s celebration was cut short by some tragic news .
pierce hawthorne , 14 @-@ year greendale student ,
entrepreneur , and expert heart attack faker
has passed away , for real this time .
pierce had been recently banned from campus ,
but not from our hearts .
he &apos;s survived by many ex @-@ wives
and all of us here at greendale that called him friend .
if you &apos;re listening , pierce ,
you were a hell of a d &amp; d player .
it &apos;s time to level up .
up next on the dial is dr. farts .
i can &apos;t believe pierce is gone .
yeah . life is weird .
it &apos;s a container for all this little stuff ,
and you get caught up in it .
and then , the container just ...
that hallway led to a dead end .
we might &apos;ve had him .
i should get home . haven &apos;t slept .
the case goes cold again .
don &apos;t worry . i got a feeling he &apos;ll be back .
or her .
