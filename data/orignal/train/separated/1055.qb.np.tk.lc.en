ellen agreed to help me look into my father
before she disappears into witsec again .
they found me .
who ?
trust sam .
i was undercover with the flynn organization .
they were a local crime family with some p.d. on the payroll .
including my father ?
his testimony brought down almost the entire organization .
i &apos;d really like you to meet peter .
no feds , or i &apos;m gone .
you investigated me .
i investigate anyone who comes into neal &apos;s life .
did he send you ?
he doesn &apos;t know i &apos;m here .
i don &apos;t know if he was followed
or his investigationnto me raised a red flag .
whose investigation ?
peter , from the fbi .
they found him because of you .
they found ellen because of you .
neal .
we are done .
fixed the coffee machine .
i didn &apos;t know it was broken .
been pouring mud for the last two weeks .
had to decalcify the basket myself .
they teach you that at quantico ?
so sue me for wanting a better cup of joe .
here , take a sip of that .
thanks , but i &apos;m cutting back on my caffeine consumption .
so , the panel -- i thought we &apos;d lead with the dutchman .
good .
dutchman &apos;s good .
our first case together .
can &apos;t go wrong with the dutchman .
no .
well , we better leave soon .
yep .
great . you want a ride over ?
i &apos;ll meet you there .
thought you were cutting down .
oh , i passed a syphon @-@ brew place on the way , couldn &apos;t resist .
see your i.ds , please .
go ahead .
this is the 53rd annual best practices conference .
they only invite the top agents from each district .
this is the first time the fbi has featured a panel
on the handler / c.i. relationship at this conference .
it &apos;s a big deal for us .
you mean for you .
no , for us .
we have the highest closure rate
of any c.i. team in the country .
they want to know what makes our partnership work .
i &apos;ve been wondering the same thing lately .
all right , enough . i know you &apos;re upset .
we &apos;ll find sam again .
you shouldn &apos;t have run his name .
the moment you contacted him --
yeah , he disappeared . i know .
after someone ransacked his place .
look , i &apos;m sorry that happened ,
but i did the right thing .
they &apos;re expecting a team out there on stage .
and because you &apos;re such a damn good con man ,
that &apos;s exactly what we &apos;re gonna give them .
that &apos;s the neal caffrey i know and love .
let &apos;s go .
when did you two realize you &apos;d make such an effective pair ?
oh , right away , would be my answer .
i mean , we &apos;ve always worked well together ,
from our first chase ...
to our first case .
well , can you elaborate on that first case ?
sure .
it started when ...
peter needed my help .
i needed your advice .
i @-@ i was pursuing a counterfeiter named curtis hagen .
ah , the notorious dutchman .
yeah , that &apos;s right .
and peter didn &apos;t know his name
until i identified hagen &apos;s initials on a bond that he &apos;d forged .
well , like neal ,
hagen had the hubris to sign his work .
fortunately , my c.i. could recognize a kindred spirit .
well , is that why mr. caffrey works so well with you ?
his insights ?
he works well with me
because i set effective boundaries .
oh , yeah . so true .
for example , the first time we met hagen
was actually at a church that was under restoration ,
so the priest wouldn &apos;t let us in ,
that is , until peter gave me the green light
to feed the priest a story .
so peter authorized you to mislead a priest !
yes . - no , it was --
it was a harmless story .
basically , i just suggested
that agent burke was struggling with issues of fidelity .
i wasn &apos;t . i wasn &apos;t .
we have an all @-@ systems security breach .
we need to clear the conference halls immediately .
i hate to cut this short ,
but we have technical difficulties ,
so , schedules permitting ,
we &apos;ll try for a follow @-@ up conversation tomorrow .
thank you , agent peter burke and mr. neal caffrey .
thank you .
everything okay ?
it appears that we have a security breach .
what &apos;s the matter ?
somebody sabotaged the meeting hall &apos;s central security room .
really ?
yeah , i &apos;m headed there now .
mind if i join ?
this is new york city -- my jurisdiction .
it &apos;s this way .
thanks . you can head home . i &apos;ll call you if i need you .
see ya .
i demand an answer .
moz , what &apos;s going on ?
you have an intruder , but he isn &apos;t talking -- yet .
i was here waiting for you when he showed up .
okay , calm down .
i will calm myself when he &apos;s given me a name .
not until you give me a name .
might i remind you who has the upper hand in this situation ?
moz , this is sam .
i knew that .
i didn &apos;t want to have to use this .
neither did i.
okay .
great . i brought a corkscrew to a gun fight .
this is mozzie . you can trust him .
just like i can trust your friend at the fbi ?
oh , sticks and stones , pistol man .
he &apos;s not a fan of the fbi .
or law enforcement .
or government or corporate @-@ sponsored governance .
but there &apos;s no one i would trust more with my life .
your apartment was ransacked .
i thought you &apos;d go underground for good .
i &apos;m not stopping till these guys are taken down .
it &apos;s just a question of whether or not i work alone .
i think we got everyone we need in this room right now .
no suit ?
no peter , but we still need the fbi .
and not in the way you think .
you were found because peter put your name
in an official report .
there no way to trace who saw that report .
whoever &apos;s behind this has access to the fbi &apos;s files .
you &apos;re right .
and they &apos;ll be waiting for your name to pop up again .
so we make samuel phelps resurface
but on our terms .
yeah .
and we draw out whoever &apos;s after me .
at the conference this morning ...
glad you could join us .
glad to be here .
... someone sabotaged the security system
and erased all the camera footage today .
there is a new technologies display
with plenty of state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art equipment ,
all of it valuable on the black market .
you think a thief is casing the place ?
possibly .
so why are we looking at the conference registry ?
because i flagged an irregularity .
this lists everyone who scanned their credentials
at the conference today .
an agent bradshaw checked in twice .
i spoke with him earlier today .
he confessed to having a few drinks at the hotel bar
and misplaced his credentials for approximately 20 minutes .
someone lifted them .
that &apos;s more than enough time to clone credentials .
he later found them on the floor .
and , out of embarrassment , kept it to himself .
how many agents are in attendance this year ?
about 500 .
and one of them is an imposter .
yeah .
someone brazen enough to pull a heist
in a room full of fbi agents .
i like him already .
these are the newest high @-@ tech gadgets
being unveiled at the conference this week .
now , which of these would be worth forging your way
past 500 federal agents ?
those mini motion detectors would appeal to a cat burglar .
cams would cut the risk on a bank job .
oh . is that a digital tracker ?
got it . the conference is a candy store to thieves .
so , never mind the &quot; what ? &quot; let &apos;s talk about the &quot; who ? &quot;
well , nothing &apos;s been taken yet ,
so the imposter could still be in there .
good . so how do we spot him ?
we have over 500 people to consider .
i &apos;m convinced there &apos;s a secret fbi handshake ,
and now is the time to use it .
there is no secret handshake .
of course that &apos;s what you &apos;d say .
that gives me an idea .
jones , diana ,
i assume you have your badges .
of course .
right here .
that &apos;s how we ferret out the imposter .
we hit the most well @-@ attended panels .
identity theft &apos;s in an hour .
it &apos;s always packed .
they pass out cookies .
are we all set to record this ?
all good .
this panel is about identity theft .
if you think you &apos;re immune because you &apos;re trained agents ,
think again .
i think you all know neal caffrey ,
a c.i. for the bureau .
thank you , sir .
if everyone would please stand .
now , i am a convicted bond forger ,
but i &apos;m also known ,
allegedly , for being pretty good at something else .
and a few minutes ago ,
i pickpocketed one of your bureau i.ds.
so , who &apos;s missing an i.d. ?
anyone ?
anybody ?
all right , no takers .
oh ! agent furlong .
think this belongs to you , sir .
you &apos;re kidding me .
i &apos;m not .
that wasn &apos;t the deal .
while i distracted you
by picking a piece of lint off your suit .
right . a valuable lesson .
thank you , mr. caffrey .
oh , it &apos;s my pleasure , sir .
enjoy the cookies .
let &apos;s bring up the panels .
nicely done .
thanks .
i always love a chance to scare a roomful of fbi agents .
back in a sec . i &apos;m gonna thank agent furlong .
that was a pretty bold move .
somebody had to do it .
anybody look suspicious ?
no , nothing yet .
thanks for being a good sport , walt .
you could &apos;ve told me he was gonna steal my i.d.
yeah , i apologize for that . he didn &apos;t tell .
i &apos;ve got a favor to ask you .
another one .
yeah .
you &apos;ve been in the d.c. area for quite a while now , haven &apos;t you ?
going on about 30 years .
i &apos;m looking into a retired cop -- sam phelps .
worked undercover for metro .
phelps .
i don &apos;t know him , but i could ask around .
thanks . i owe you one .
i owe you two .
all right , well , how about you and caffrey
finish up your panel , we call it even ?
everyone wants to know more about you two .
although , uh , maybe you skip the rest of that priest story .
good idea .
gordon &apos;s birthday party -- are we going to this ?
the big &quot; lebowlski , &quot; again ?
you love bowling .
no , you love bowling .
well , that &apos;s because i &apos;m inexplicably good at it .
come on . it &apos;ll be fun .
eh , maybe .
my conference was supposed to be fun .
the panel with neal not go well ?
we pulled it off .
oh , honey , i &apos;m sorry .
i really thought reaching out to sam was a good idea .
i thought sam did , as well .
i don &apos;t know how they caught on to him
or who caught on to him ,
but he could &apos;ve handled it better before skipping town .
do you know where sam went ?
no .
i &apos;ve got walt furlong asking around in d.c. ,
see if his contacts can find him .
well , if walt finds anything , you need to tell neal .
i will , but i don &apos;t think he &apos;ll want to hear it .
you didn &apos;t want to hear about the bowling party ,
but we are going .
and we are gonna bring home that trophy again , right ?
right ?
yes .
right ? yes .
yes .
here you go .
so , how did things go at the suit convention ?
we &apos;re back to a status quo i can work with .
oh , so he &apos;s suspicious you &apos;re up to something ,
and you &apos;re aware he &apos;s watching you like a redtail .
hell of a dynamic you got there .
well , it has its perks .
i could slip out with one of these .
what is it ?
state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art government tracker .
it embeds in the skin like a tick .
the subject is completely unaware it &apos;s there .
so we bait whoever &apos;s after sam ,
then plant that in them .
how do we bait out our target ?
surveillance @-@ authorization form .
we plant information to lure out whoever came after you .
only this time , we control the circumstances .
we need a secure location .
we can use friday ,
my third @-@ favorite safe house .
all right , it takes eight hours for this form to be processed .
if we file it tomorrow morning ,
our surprise guest could show up before nightfall .
won &apos;t a couple of agents end up sitting on the safe house ?
if peter doesn &apos;t know he &apos;s authorized ,
then he won &apos;t assign anyone to it .
great . so , forge his signature .
unfortunately , i can &apos;t forge it .
it &apos;s not quite that simple .
see , first thing every thursday morning ,
diana readies a stack of surveillance requests for peter to sign .
once he finishes ,
she takes them directly to the agent in charge of logging them .
no weak links in the chain .
that means you &apos;re gonna have to con peter .
yeah , which won &apos;t be easy .
surveillance authorizations -- must be thursday .
now , diana preps the forms , but peter scans each one
and double @-@ checks the count when he &apos;s done .
eight of them this week .
can you replace one of the forms with your fake ?
i could , but peter likes to switch up the color of ink
he uses when he signs his name .
it &apos;s a habit of his since we started working together .
incredibly paranoid and presumptive of him .
i respect that .
the only way to pull this off
is to trick peter into signing the document himself .
you &apos;re gonna need a distraction .
any leads on our fbi imposter ?
i &apos;ll let you know when there is .
what &apos;s the one thing that can infiltrate anywhere in new york ,
including the fbi building ?
micro @-@ drones .
keep going .
vermin .
yes . may i borrow percy ?
my pet rat --
he eats all the fancy cheeses that i ... can &apos;t .
in many ways , i live through him .
many ways ?
don &apos;t get him started .
once peter &apos;s scanned the last form ,
but before he signs it ...
rat ! rat !
can i get a little help here ? !
what is going on ?
rat !
please tell me that &apos;s a chihuahua .
look at the size of that tail !
i &apos;m not going there .
wait a second . okay .
all right .
somebody call the exterminator ?
for every one you see , there &apos;s about 10 you don &apos;t see .
hey , i saw &quot; ratatouille . &quot;
anybody got eyes on that thing ? !
anybody ? !
and if all that works ...
six , seven , eight .
there you go .
... the bait will be set .
any luck finding our mystery guest ?
four agents didn &apos;t immediately pat their pockets .
oh , that &apos;s bob sanders . he was hung over .
that guy &apos;s busy checking his blackberry .
and she &apos;s yawning .
and the fourth ?
not an agent .
i just got the facial @-@ recognition results .
meet ted anderson .
he was a force reconnaissance marine in the gulf war .
after that , he did five years in iraq -- freelance security .
lately he &apos;s been consulting with some well @-@ known tech companies .
private security ?
it doesn &apos;t say .
why hide the fact that he &apos;s working security ?
because he &apos;s engaged in corporate espionage .
sounds right .
the only question is ,
which of the items is he after ?
let &apos;s talk to him and find out .
but i don &apos;t want to spook him .
he might already recognize us from the panel .
jones and diana will do the meet .
let &apos;s get eyes on anderson and make this happen .
furlong e @-@ mailed me sam &apos;s retirement information .
let me guess -- shuffleboard after breakfast ,
chess at 2 : 00 , dinner at 4 : 00 ?
unknown .
all it shows is that he retired
on a boat in southern florida .
florida ?
yeah , when neal first reached out to sam ,
he was in d.c.
now furlong is telling me
that sam retired to the sunshine state .
you want me to look into it ?
no , i want you to get ready for the anderson meet .
i &apos;ll reach out to the people in miami ,
see if they can tell us what he &apos;s been doing down there .
without making an official report .
maybe i &apos;m interviewing fbi retirees
for an alumni newsletter .
agent burke , the writer .
you buy it ?
no .
but you could sell it .
checked anderson &apos;s credit cards .
for the last week , he &apos;s been hitting up a coffee shop
across from the meeting hall at 10 : 00 a.m.
probably doing his recon .
that &apos;s in 30 . if he &apos;s there ,
try and get him to talk without knowing we &apos;re onto him .
gotcha .
hi , this is agent peter burke ,
new york white collar division .
how are things in miami today ?
thank you . take care .
what do you think you &apos;re doing ?
i &apos;m taking my break .
have you seen this ?
no , i haven &apos;t seen this . what &apos;s going on ?
some sort of security screw @-@ up yesterday .
now they &apos;re rearranging security protocol
and shifting panel times !
this is your job . come fix it .
hey ! fine . can i just finish my muffin ?
no !
can i help you ?
well , i was really hoping
i could , uh , see the hudson group panel .
maybe you could tell me what time that &apos;s at .
no . your break is over !
yeah , she &apos;s a real charmer , isn &apos;t she ?
maybe you should get a nicer boss .
you know what ? i would if i could .
hey , man , maybe you could help me out .
yeah , look , i don &apos;t know , man .
it &apos;d piss her off if i did , you know ? i ...
yeah , it would , wouldn &apos;t it ?
gonna stick it to her , huh ? okay .
hudson panel .
you &apos;re lucky .
hudson group is the same time -- 2 : 00 .
thanks , man . appreciate it .
any time .
i like you all fiery .
me too .
looking for this ?
thank you .
couldn &apos;t resist ?
you caught me .
doesn &apos;t have that rusty chalk taste .
th &apos;s a vinegar decalcification --
ah , no spoilers .
let me enjoy it .
so , we may be able to get to finish our panel .
great .
think we can skip my blasphemy
and disregard of the seventh commandment ?
are you sure ? because i have a great joke
that starts with you and a priest walking into a bar .
neal . - all -- all right .
we get to finish the dutchman story .
we &apos;ll do it right .
you ever wonder what would &apos;ve happened
if i hadn &apos;t made you my c.i. ?
i &apos;d still be in jail ,
and your arrest rate would be in the low 70s .
high 80s .
why did you take my deal ?
i told you -- your expertise .
that &apos;s all ?
i realized all those crimes you were committing ,
they were never about money or greed .
what do you think they were about ?
the challenge .
that &apos;s what we have in common .
i love the challenge .
i know you do .
and after all those years of chasing you ,
your cryptic clues ,
your late @-@ night phone calls from international numbers .
all the cookies and birthday cards .
yeah .
i realized i liked you .
that &apos;s why i took your deal .
any word from sam ?
well , he said he &apos;s leaving town .
i &apos;m sure he did say that .
we &apos;ll find him .
yeah .
anderson is targeting a cutting @-@ edge bulletproof vest
from the hudson group .
word is , this will be the best protection on the market .
my favorite kind of protection
is avoiding situations where people might shoot at me .
the hudson group is unveiling its sole working prototype
at the conference today .
if anderson gets his hands on it ,
whoever hired him can reverse @-@ engineer the technology .
could be worth billions .
we can grab anderson for impersonating a federal agent .
i &apos;m sure he &apos;s disposed of his fake credentials by now .
yeah , if we can &apos;t prove that he used them ,
the most we have on him is trespassing .
we &apos;ll never know who hired him .
we &apos;ll wait until he makes his move on the vest .
then we can add several felony counts ,
including espionage .
if we &apos;re gonna use the vest as bait ,
we should contact the hudson group .
and get their presenter to come in .
worked like a charm .
the guy was a trouper .
he returned to the briefcase and everything .
ah , because i had some caciocavallo cheese
waiting for him .
it was as good as we hoped , wasn &apos;t it , percy ?
hey , if you start acting out scenes
from &quot; willard &quot; again , i &apos;m leaving .
that the safe house ?
yep .
like i said --
private , secure , controlled .
perfect .
when our guest shows up looking for sam ,
we &apos;ll claim ignorance , tag him , and send him on his way .
okay . so , do you have the tracker ?
not yet -- anderson &apos;s gonna try to steal
a different piece of technology from the conference .
when that happens , i &apos;ll seize the window of opportunity .
piggybacking on a fellow thief .
taking advantage of a craftsman &apos;s hard work .
okay , you &apos;re only saying that
&apos;cause he &apos;s going up against the bureau .
one against 500 .
i like those odds .
hey , can you get me anderson &apos;s thumbprint
for my collection ?
yeah . yeah , i &apos;ll work on that .
did you miss me , percy ?
talked to the hudson group .
the inventor of the vest is in town for the conference .
he &apos;s coming in .
that &apos;s good .
everything okay , boss ?
florida confirmed that sam phelps
was a resident of the state .
&quot; was &quot; ?
sam phelps has been dead for three years .
if sam &apos;s dead , who &apos;s neal been dealing with ?
non @-@ office meeting .
this is about the ominous .
i know the last thing you want to hear right now
is that i looked into sam again , but ...
why would you do that ? we just --
sam phelps is dead .
july 17th , three years ago .
he suffered from a heart attack in his boat in key west .
what are you talking about ?
he retired in florida .
none of this sat right with me from the start .
he didn &apos;t want us vetting him with fbi resources ,
and now i know why .
sooner or later , we &apos;d find out
that the real sam phelps was dead .
this doesn &apos;t necessarily mean sam isn &apos;t who he says he is .
death certificates don &apos;t issue themselves .
no . coroners do --
for around $ 500 , in my experience .
i may or may not have faked my death on multiple occasions .
panama city , bangalore .
monterey bay .
i remember -- gored by a great white shark .
thought you might appreciate that .
who doesn &apos;t love a good shark mauling ?
are you telling me that sam faked his own death ?
come on . he &apos;s had a target on his back for over 30 years .
he was an undercover cop .
i &apos;m sure he has a long list of enemies .
he retired in florida .
bought a houseboat .
okay , then what &apos;s your theory ?
we &apos;ve both been alone with sam .
we &apos;re still standing here .
if he &apos;s an imposter , what &apos;s his end game ?
he wants the evidence box that ellen showed in the video .
take down the corrupt cops .
maybe he &apos;s one of the corrupt cops .
no .
you have to consider that an option .
take your time . i know it &apos;s a lot to absorb .
just don &apos;t --
do what i normally do . i got it .
you were right to think neal was up to something .
what &apos;d he do ?
technically nothing .
you , on the other hand ,
authorized a surveillance request on sam phelps .
i don &apos;t remember doing that .
and yet here &apos;s my signature .
the rat .
oh , he drives me nuts .
no well ,
i &apos;m talking about the rat in the office .
that &apos;s when he swapped the documents .
why ?
he spent all this time making sure
we kept sam &apos;s name out of the official files .
and now he &apos;s put it in himself .
neal &apos;s setting a trap
to lure out whoever has bureau access
and is trying to get to sam .
what do you want to do ?
find sam . bet he &apos;s back in town .
i &apos;ll be there to see if neal &apos;s trap catches anything .
what &apos;s our e.t.a. on drugov ?
his security detail &apos;s escorting him in now .
i want a security detail .
you should &apos;ve invented a vest .
dr. drugov , thanks for coming .
i know that you rarely stray from the hudson facility .
well , i &apos;ve been out there .
&quot; facility &quot; doesn &apos;t do it justice .
more like a stronghold .
they keep our research well guarded .
which makes today &apos;s unveiling a rare opportunity for theft .
nearly six years and over a hundred million
went into the design of this little accessory .
that &apos;s a lot of money for a bulletproof vest .
for the bulletproof vest .
the tgv @-@ 6 can withstand a greater projectile impulse
than any body armor on the market ,
including full @-@ metal rounds .
it disperses the force of the slug .
like no vest before it .
being shot in my vest
feels not radically dissimilar from a nice , firm hug ,
and it &apos;s slim enough to fit under your suit jacket
without a bulge .
well , diana doesn &apos;t like bulges .
doctor , we have reason to believe this man ,
ted anderson , may attempt to steal it .
we &apos;ll make sure that doesn &apos;t happen .
tell me about your presentation .
i was hoping to demonstrate the vest &apos;s capabilities
by placing it on a live volunteer .
what , and shooting him ?
yes . but they wouldn &apos;t let me .
well , i &apos;m sure it will still be fun .
has the piggybacking commenced ?
soon . but i want to plant the tracker
on a new target .
and that target is ?
peter has intell that sam isn &apos;t who he says he is .
okay , is this good intell or government intell ?
do you know where he is ?
yeah , he &apos;s on his way here .
we &apos;re waiting for you to show up with the tracker ,
and then we &apos;re gonna go stake out the safe house .
stall until i get there .
don &apos;t let him out of your sight .
okay .
still no sign of him on the monitors .
nothing here , either .
see anything interesting ?
i see a lot of interesting things ,
but no anderson yet .
boss .
what ?
our team lost anderson .
when ?
just now .
anderson just slipped our tail .
i came to this country only six years ago ,
and the hudson group gave me my dream --
a lab to create life @-@ saving devices
rather than life @-@ taking ones .
and the results ?
the best protective body armor on the market today .
i give you tgv @-@ 6 .
never before has there been body armor
designed to ensure your safety
as soundly as you ensure the safety and freedom of every american .
within 24 months , god and congress willing ,
this will be standard @-@ issue for each and every one of you .
i still don &apos;t have eyes on anderson .
i &apos;m checking through the stairwells .
wait . he &apos;s here .
stairwell &quot; d. &quot;
is that semtex ?
boss , you have to evacuate everyone now .
anderson &apos;s planting plastic explosives .
thanks very much . excellent .
thanks , everyone . quickly as possible , everyone .
walt , make sure they leave the building .
what about drugov ?
no . no , no , no . i want you out of the building .
anderson is in here now . go .
my vest .
i &apos;ll take responsibility for that .
go . go , come on . quickly .
stay with him .
boss , we &apos;re in the stairwell .
no anderson , no explosives .
what ?
anderson faked the security footage . why ?
he must have hacked into the system
to clear out the building .
the vest is here .
the room is empty . where &apos;s anderson ?
think -- what the hell is he up to ?
i don &apos;t know . maybe we got the wrong target .
what the hell &apos;s more valuable than the vest ?
the mind that created it .
it &apos;s got to be .
this isn &apos;t a theft .
it &apos;s a kidnapping .
i &apos;ll catch up to drugov at the back exit .
drugov , get in the van . get in the van !
anderson , drop your weapon !
down , anderson , down !
get out of the way . all i want is drugov .
i can &apos;t let you take him , anderson !
it doesn &apos;t have to be like this .
drugov , just come with me
and you won &apos;t get hurt .
you &apos;re not leaving here a free man .
diana , anderson has me pinned ,
and i &apos;m running out of ammo .
seventh @-@ level parking garage . i need backup .
go !
i &apos;m out . throw me a clip .
keeping an eye on the clock , anderson ?
probably thought you &apos;d be out of here by now .
i know i would &apos;ve .
i &apos;m not leaving without him .
what are you doing ?
getting you to safety .
well , right now , i got 50 guns coming for you .
it is not gonna be pretty .
all available units to level seven of the conference hall parking garage .
anderson , come on !
all right .
they &apos;re back here !
go ! go , go , go !
diana , where &apos;s my backup ?
neal !
fbi , guns down ! you &apos;re surrounded !
hey , you -- gun down .
neal .
nice shot .
yours , not his .
you were wearing the vest .
i thought you avoided these kind of situations .
he shot me in my favorite tie .
maybe drugov can make you one to match the vest .
did it feel like a hug ?
not a gentle hug .
no ?
no .
more like a russian bear hug .
yeah .
moz , listen , there &apos;s been a complication .
i didn &apos;t get the tracker .
oh , i can beat that . fake sam &apos;s gone rogue .
what ?
he said he didn &apos;t want to involve us .
he left , i assume for the safe house .
what , you didn &apos;t stop him ?
um , he carries a gun .
and all i had was the corkscrew .
all right . i &apos;m going to the safe house .
neal , he said he wants to handle this himself .
well , what if he can &apos;t ?
okay .
i &apos;ll -- i &apos;ll meet you there .
that &apos;s sam .
yeah , or so he says .
well , we &apos;re never gonna find out unless we do something .
i &apos;m going .
neal .
the man who did this is on the other side of that wall .
he &apos;s armed .
i &apos;ll go around outside
and see if i can get a look at him .
diana , i need local backup in greenpoint .
suspect heading on a rooftop , southbound , by the east river .
sit down here .
why did you come alone ?
i got tired of waiting for answers .
i thought if i threatened whoever showed ,
he &apos;d tell me everything .
and i didn &apos;t want you getting hurt if things went bad .
he got the jump on you .
oh , man .
if you hadn &apos;t have showed , that would &apos;ve been it .
who is he ?
oh , i don &apos;t know .
he thought i had ellen &apos;s evidence .
i couldn &apos;t convince him otherwise .
he &apos;s gone .
you and mozzie head back to my place .
i &apos;m gonna check on peter .
hey . hey .
this guy doesn &apos;t know about you , neal .
keep it that way .
all right .
come on .
okay .
did you get a good look at him ?
i didn &apos;t see his face , but i saw his tattoo .
you put sam &apos;s name on one of my surveillance authorizations .
hey , it worked .
we almost caught ellen &apos;s killer .
where is sam or whoever he is ?
mozzie brought him back to my place .
he &apos;s gonna keep him there until we know .
sam &apos;s blood .
run his dna .
then we &apos;ll know for sure .
peter , i &apos;ve got some info .
so , this is caffrey &apos;s sketch of that guy &apos;s tattoo .
and this is the match that it got us .
dennis flynn .
yeah . it &apos;s a variation on his ancestral crest .
the fynns were an organized @-@ crime family
back in the baltimore / d.c. area .
thanks , jones .
thank you .
well , if you need me ,
i &apos;ll be meeting with the exterminators .
so what &apos;s an irish mobster doing so far from home ?
in ellen &apos;s video , she said
my father turned state &apos;s evidence after the murder .
but she didn &apos;t know who he testified against .
sam told me it was the flynns .
my father &apos;s testimony put most of them away for good .
dennis fynn sr. died in prison .
this is his son .
maybe he &apos;s here for revenge .
if he is , he &apos;s got to be the one who killed ellen .
maybe .
but how does a punk like him have access to the fbi database ?
or the marshals &apos; info on her ?
well , he had help .
ellen and sam collected evidence
showing that the corrupt cops were on the flynns &apos; payroll .
if it is one of the higher @-@ ups in the bureau ,
they convince this flynn kid to do it as revenge
in the name of the father .
maybe they offered to help him
restart the family business in exchange .
ah , not now .
what is it ?
agent furlong rescheduled our panel for this afternoon .
i &apos;ll cancel .
no .
let &apos;s do it .
yeah ?
yeah .
i could use the distraction ,
and it &apos;ll take organized crime all afternoon
to pull the intel anyway .
you sure ?
i am .
this panel &apos;s a big deal for us , right ?
yeah .
so , what do you want to talk about up there ?
mortenson loan scandal ?
loan scandal .
peter , we found a nazi submarine
dredged up by an infamous ponzi schemer .
that &apos;s a story .
want to talk about what happened
to the contents of that sub ?
point taken .
hello , gentlemen .
everyone &apos;s excited for your discussion .
thanks .
maybe the yankee stadium job .
mm . mozzie was involved .
right .
ooh , i got it . avery .
ooh , the airless comic @-@ book vault .
perfect .
so we &apos;re heading down the hallway ,
and we need to separate ourselves .
yeah .
so then neal trips the security system
to bring down the glass wall .
yeah , that protected peter from avery &apos;s shotgun blast .
yeah .
but the fire @-@ suppression system
sucked all the oxygen out of the room .
neal refused to take any of the air
from the mini @-@ breather i was using .
it only gave us five minutes &apos; worth of oxygen
to find the kill switch , which i did .
and then you passed out .
he needed oxygen , so i opened the glass wall ,
ready to shoot it out with avery .
yeah , and then our team came in from behind , and he gave up .
at least that &apos;s what peter told me .
i was unconscious at the time , so don &apos;t hold me to that .
well , i assume that there &apos;s an immense trust
between the two of you .
usually .
but even when there isn &apos;t trust , there &apos;s always faith .
faith .
that whatever the other &apos;s doing , it &apos;s for a good reason .
as long as peter has faith in me ,
i &apos;ll have faith in him .
any idea who sam really is ?
not yet .
put a rush on his dna test -- be back soon .
are you going back to the office ?
yeah , too restless here .
i want to be there when the results come in .
which side do you think he &apos;s on ?
i don &apos;t know . his own ?
i can &apos;t get a read on him .
that &apos;s not like you .
yeah , that &apos;s what worries me .
well , if you had to guess .
this damn evidence box has been the focus of everything .
ellen said that she found a lot of dirt
on a lot of bad cops .
my gut keeps telling me that he isn &apos;t here
to help neal find the box .
i think he &apos;s here because he &apos;s in the box .
one of the bad guys .
yeah .
if there are things in there that link him to crimes ,
to murders ...
if i were him , i &apos;d want it .
enough reason to pull a long con .
yeah . it is .
i &apos;ll know soon .
bye .
see ya , honey .
results of the blood sample ?
yeah .
it belongs to a d.c. cop , all right .
it just isn &apos;t samuel phelps .
hey . you holding up ?
trying to . any leads ?
we &apos;ll know who we &apos;re dealing with soon enough .
excuse me .
got the results back on sam .
peter , he &apos;s here .
there &apos;s something ...
something you have to know , neal .
you okay ?
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
tell you what ?
that you &apos;re my father .
