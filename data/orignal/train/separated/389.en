Criminal Minds
[根本没时间进行无谓的争执]
Get a good shot at her face
Make a wish!
[联邦调查局行为分析组]
Come on man! Blow, baby blow!
I thought you are a full of heart, Reid
Come on, Reid.
They're trick candles, Spence OKay?
They gonna come back on every time.
Oh, mommy to rescue you!
Mommy?
可他才24岁 感觉很奇妙吧
Matching what I know by 50.
Hope you like chocolate.
Agent Hotchner?
You having fun?
Yes, definitely. I'm definitely having fun.
Make a wish?
Can I take this hat off?
I wouldn't.
Hey Spence, first piece for the birthday boy.
Do you know she's the only person in the whole world
who calls me "Spence"?
小寿星
生日聚会到此为止
We're going to San Diego.
Not for the surfing, huh?
They're calling him the Tommy killer.
6 women raped and murdered in their homes in the last 3 weeks.
6 in 3 weeks?
That's a short fuse.
And getting shorter. The first 2 were 8 days apart
then the next 4 in 2 weeks.
Rapid escalation.
Do you think he's regressing to a psychopathic frenzy?
No, he's too controlled for that.
See you on the plane.
Why the Tommy killer?
You know the rock opera?
使受害者的眼睛撑开
He wants them to see him.
And feel him.
French poet Jacques Rigaut said
"Don't forget that I cannot see myself
that my role is limited to being the one who looks in the mirror."
Brenda Samms was found yesterday by her children
when they got home from school.
She had been strangled with a thin ligature, possibly a wire.
No weapon left at the scene.
Residue on the wrist and mouth
indicate that duct tape was used and then removed.
Also not found at the scene.
Brought it with him, took it with him.
他就开始在现场留下了讯息
This was on the mirrors.
"Fair lady, throw those costly robes aside.
No longer may you glory in your pride.
Take leave of all your carnal, vain delight."
"I've come to summon you away this night."
It's a ballad from the late 1600s.
A dialogue betwixt death and a lady.
A 17th century ballad?
不要夺去她的生命
What kind of person knows this ballad?
Are we looking for a literature professor?
Anyone with an internet connection, actually.
You should see what comes in when you type the word
"death" into a search engine.
Reid, no wonder you can't get a date.
Reid, you stay on the messages.
See if there's a deeper meaning.
It definitely looks like he ransacked the crime scene pretty well.
A lot of damage, nothing taken.
The eyes are the thing, the signature.
The behavior that isn't necessary for the murder,
but necessary for the emotional release.
That's what he's there for.
There used to be a widely held belief
that the eyes record a snapshot
of the last thing a person sees before they die.
Yeah, that's right.
People used to write poems about talking to death.
Ballads.
Whatever.
You think they'll ever run out of new things
正是我们所擅长的
Captain Griffith, task force commander.
Sorry, we all get tunnel vision.
这是詹若 我们的联络员
I appreciate you coming out.
Thanks, hope we can help.
Hi, you've reached the Chandlers.
Leave a message, and have a beautiful day.
What a good soccer game.
I'm so proud of you.
When's mommy coming in?
Happy anniversary, honey. Love you.
Ready for bed, mom. Will you tuck me in?
使受害者的眼睛撑开
They're calling him the Tommy killer.
It definitely looks like he ransacked the crime scene.
Do you have a lot of homework, sweetie?
Mom? Mom? Mom, where are you?
难道你没有听说过吗
You may as well be mute..."
creepy, huh?
Actually, conversations between death and his victims
是很流行的文艺体裁
Yeah, creepy.
屡屡作案
Extremely high-risk victims at a high-risk time.
He's confident in his ability.
Looks to be about a 5-square mile radius.
So he probably has a vehicle.
You wanna see that crime scene?
It's still taped off.
The husband won't go back inside.
Let's go.
All right, so we need answers to these questions.
What does the evidence tell you about the sexual aspect?
What kind of rapist is he independent of the homicides?
I'm on it.
It looks like what he's written at the scenes
are most of the first 3 verses of the same ballad.
Most of?
It's only one part of the conversation.
There's no "betwixt."
Death speaks, but the lady never answers.
Maybe he feels like their bodies are answer enough.
Very nice.
This profiling really works?
It's a tool.
你就知道疑犯的所有情况
Well, the scene's only part of it.
We also use victimology, precedent.
We can usually get a fairly clear picture of the guy.
Our guys went over it pretty well.
I'm sure they did.
Local officers aren't trained to look for the things we look for.
What's that?
Hate, insecurity, fear, anger.
That's all at the scene?
It's all in his behavior.
You know anything about our guy yet?
Yeah. He isn't gonna stop until he's caught.
You increased patrols in these neighborhoods
when the pattern was identified?
After the fourth victim.
Bosses cancelled days off, vacations.
但他还是又两度犯案
我是吉迪恩
There may have been another attempt 6 blocks from the station house.
Attempt?
The husband interrupted, and the attacker got away
But Elle and I are headed over there right now.
Well, we're already at the last crime scene.
Let us know if you identify a suspect.
Suspect?
可能发生了另一起袭击事件
Hey. Hey. Hey. Where you going?
Over there.
Well, units are already heading that way.
We can get more accomplished here.
You're kidding me, right?
No. If there's an arrest
What we find here will help you prosecute.
The scene won't be pristine forever.
谢谢
Hey, wait a minute.
The unsub went through the back, right?
那扇满是提指纹粉的窗户就是了
Gideon, I'm going around the house.
Ok, not that easy to maneuver.
That means I'm a little bit athletic
All right.
I messed with something in here.
Broken Cappuccino machine.
却出现在了楼上 为什么
Why would I take the time?
Lucky woman.
自己有多幸运
You're absolutely sure about that, Mr. Gordon?
He was black and 6 feet tall.
I watched him run out that back door.
Get a description out in the field A.S.A.P.
非常罕见
Are they impossible?
No.
Then what's your point?
Only to provide you with information.
I'm gonna go talk to her.
May I ask why?
She's surrounded by men.
Mrs. Gordon? I'm Elle.
Would you like to go outside?
It's all right.
We're just gonna go some place quiet.
Here's where I got the china.
The silver.
I didn't take it, I broke it.
Why wouldn't she hear me?
Because I did it after.
"You may as well be mute.
There is no time at all for vain dispute
Your riches, gold, and garments, jewels bright
必将受到新主人的照耀
I really don't know that much about him.
Well, you don't have to.
Just take a little time to collect your thoughts
To just sit here, breathe.
You don't want to ask me questions?
Not until you're ready.
I'll be right behind that doorway.
I didn't even know he was in the house.
Is that common?
Very.
She had a workout video on.
Step aerobics.
Step aerobics?
With the platforms?
Step up, step down, step up, step down?
Where's the platform?
He spent a lot of time here.
What, so he vacuumed?
I mean, there's no marks from the platforms.
A lot of time.
The broken things.
或者动弹不得了
碟子 花瓶 还有砸破的珠宝
Symbols.
"Your riches, gold, garments, jewels bright.
Your house and land must on new owners light."
Her riches.
Right.
有些东西虽近在咫尺
You just can't see it?
Yeah, usually right before a woman dumps me.
He slapped me from behind
He pulled me down on the floor.
可他力气太大了
And then my husband came home from work.
He screamed, and the man ran out the door.
He was a black man.
我只记得他的眼睛
When we were fighting, I kept staring him right in the eyes.
I remember thinking, "if he's gonna kill me
Then he's gonna have to look at me while he does."
And he just kept staring back at me through the ski mask.
A ski mask.
Yeah.
It's all right. You did good.
The verses.
Found something?
Not an answer, a question.
I found the full text.
He's pretty much following it to a t,
At least the Death side of the conversation.
But?
Why didn't he leave them at the first 3 murders?
光死神的话就有10段
He's got plenty to work with.
But if it's not part of his signature
It isn't something that he has to do for an emotional reason
Then, I mean, why start?
第一次报道这个不明嫌犯
When?
After which victim.
Yeah, you got it.
What're you thinking?
He wasn't getting enough attention.
The police department sometimes don't even realize
they're looking at a pattern.
Yeah, until somebody tells 'em.
被发现后的第二天早上
才开始加强
Yeah, the police didn't realize what was happening
He writes his verse, and--
And everyone knows that he was there.
是名黑人男子
Black male? That's cross racial. That doesn't happen.
What about Herbert Mullin?
不同种族 不同信仰的人
But there was no sexual component to his crimes.
And he wore a ski mask.
This attacker wore a ski mask.
Tell 'em we're ready.
For a profile?
自己跟我们联系
The unsub brought the weapons with him
Tape, glue, wire.
He did not leave them at the scene.
He took them when he left.
He has a kind of killing kit that he carries.
可能是技术类相关
Which may involve the use of the hands.
The crime scenes are far enough apart that he needs a vehicle.
就像他家里一样
这几次袭击都是白天发生的
可能是公车或者卡车
We believe he watches the victims for a time
掌握作案的时段
You're not gonna catch him accidentally.
He destroys symbols of wealth in the victim's homes.
He harbors envy of and hatred toward people of a higher social class.
He feels invisible around them.
Class is the theme of the poem
which he left at the various crime scenes.
At one point in the poem, the women attempts to bribe death
But he doesn't accept it.
He says this is the one moment when riches mean nothing
When death comes, the poor and the rich are exactly alike.
So he's poor.
Probably middle-class.
A decidedly lower-class person would
stick out in a highly patrolled neighborhood.
混进了社区
Why does he glue the eyes open?
The unsub is an exploitative rapist.
会闭眼 侧过脸去
这就破坏了性幻想
For this type of rapist, the goal is more related to
而不是性侵犯这一过程
以及攻击性的话语"我是死神"
This is a guy who, while being in control of the crime scene
Almost certainly feels inadequate in the rest of his life.
他的所作所为
都算在自己头上的原因
都是一直控制着他的人的象征
And he wants that control back.
很强势的女人俯首帖耳
And a final point. He is white.
We have witnesses that identify him as a black male.
The attacker was black.
He is not the Tommy killer.
Mrs. Gordon's husband came home
at the same time that he always does.
The Tommy killer would've known that.
And Mrs. Gordon's attacker wore a ski mask.
The unsub knows when he walks into a house
he's going to kill the woman who lives there.
If you're not leaving any witnesses,
why wear a ski mask?
And he wants the victim to see him anyway.
Your attempted rapist is a garden variety
disorganized young man.
As the victim's age goes up, generally
the attacker's age goes down.
Mrs. Gordon is about 60,
Which puts her rapist at about 20.
And it takes years to develop the level of calm and sophistication
That Tommy displays at a crime scene.
The rapist is far too young for that.
Mrs. Gordon told me that there's a young man
who delivers groceries to their home.
He fits a lot of what we're describing here.
又一无所知了
Not at all.
May I see you in your office for a moment?
You have a tip line for the public?
Yes.
可以窃听你的电话
He's gonna call us?
Well, he's gone out of his way to show you how scary he is.
报道一位6英尺高的黑人
of a 6 foot tall black man in connection with his crimes
He's gonna be furious.
Furious enough to call.
Later, man. See ya.
FBI. You're under arrest.
强奸未遂而被捕
What?!
The FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit
was called in yesterday afternoon
by the San Diego police department to assist in
the ongoing Tommy killer investigation.
The unit is headed--
I can now announce that our office has assisted
in making an arrest in connection with the investigation.
That's all I can say at this time.
He confessed to Mrs. Gordon's attack
before we even got to the car.
Thanks, Elle.
Should just make the 11:00 news.
Did they get good footage?
Yeah, couldn't miss him.
Good. Now we wait.
Contact Garcia.
Go for Mrs. Penelope Garcia.
Ready with the trap and trace?
可不是吃素的
I am always ready.
With the awesome power I have in this room
来逮住这个变态色情狂
15 seconds?
If that.
I can now announce that our office has assisted
in making an arrest in connection with the investigation.
That's really all I can say at this time.
Turn that damn television down!
I'm sorry.
We're still waiting, Garcia.
God, I hate waiting like this.
Do you think it's weird that I knew that ballad?
你是怎么知道这么多的
but I'm glad you do.
Do you think it's why I can't get a date?
You ever ask anyone out?
No.
That's why you can't get a date.
Detective Martin.
Line 6, Penelope. Line 6.
You stupid, incompetent sons of bitches!
我是死神 听到了吗
I am death! You'll see now.
Tomorrow, mark my words, you will see.
And while I'm taking her, I'm gonna be thinking of you.
Anything?
Are you kidding me?
I don't know how this is possible
足以查到地址
根本什么都没查到
Let me work on this.
She said she got nothing.
Nothing?
We missed him?
We have an undercover car for each of your teams
and the entire damn department out there, too.
或是辆保养不错的工作卡车
Everyone knows.
All right, he might make a mistake today.
He's angry, and he probably hasn't
Done the kind of surveillance he'd like.
Yeah, well, neither have we.
Let's go, Reid.
I'll bring the car around.
We'll find him.
That's the last place he watched.
That house.
Morgan said the family hasn't moved back in.
Probably never will.
It's the eyes.
Excuse me?
It's the eyes, Elle.
Just something not right about the eyes.
我同意
No. It's almost a classic move for
an exploitative rapist to force a victim to watch.
But?
We're missing something about it.
It's 10:30 already.
All he said was tomorrow. He didn't...
specify morning.
Reid, this guy's gotta spend a lot of time in that house.
A lot. He needs it to be morning.
Are we sure this is a good spot?
3 of the victims lived within a block of this street.
It's the main artery through the neighborhood.
True, but 3 victims in the same block
could mean he's done with the area.
Or that he's just really familiar with it.
And comfortable in it.
But then, on the other hand
离其他案发地点一英里以外
Right.
God, I hate not having a plan.
We're looking for a needle in a haystack here.
Actually, it's more like we're looking for
What?
A needle would stand out in a haystack.
平平无奇的人
找一根特别的针
Can I help you folks with something?
FBI.
Oh, sorry.
警方在这些小区加倍了巡逻人手
then double them again after the fifth and sixth.
Yet our unsub still watched the houses.
How could he not have been seen?
Is that an oriole?
No. A black-headed grosbeak.
Grosbeak?
Grosbeak, female.
Orson Welles said
All the birds that belong to our sex have prettier feathers.
'cause males have got to try to justify their existence.
看看我 看看我
"Mommy, mommy. Look at me."
Yeah?
25?
Look at me.
Ok.
Garcia couldn't get a fix on the call
25个不同的分站打过来的
25 substations.
He wanted them to see him.
We established that.
He's meticulous. Nothing is an accident.
He vacuumed.
Seeing is about domination.
His creation.
He positioned everything exactly the way he wanted it.
And?
If the eyes were so they could watch the attack
why are they all facing away from it?
她们无法看到他作案的过程
He wanted them to see him afterward.
佩内洛普·加西亚为您服务
Speak, oh fortunate one.
Garcia, it's Elle.
圣地亚哥的电话维修记录
Sunshine...
一边玩俄罗斯方块
和维修工做交叉对比
It could be as much as four or five days prior.
See if there are any common names.
Total cake. Stay on the line.
What you got?
He's a phone technician, Hotch.
大白天在街区徘徊的人
Who notices a phone guy up on a pole?
He can watch for husbands leaving for work
还有小区什么时候最安静
他有充裕的时间作案
确定目标是否在家
How about routing a call through 25 substations?
Backyard? Hey, he's just looking for a pole.
Got tape? Course he does.
Wire? He's a repairman.
Sounds right, Jason.
It is right, and we have his name.
There you go. Oh, that's a good boy.
You want some juice, big boy?
You want some juice? Ok.
Mommy.
宝宝要喝苹果汁 小淘气
That's your favorite.
I know. I know you love it.
FBI.
现在在哪
FBI?
Where are your technicians?
They're all out in the field.
Listen! I need Franklin Graney right now.
Now you'll lay down.
我还有个儿子
Cooperate and you'll be all right.
Please. Oh!
Cooperate and you'll be all right.
He's on service calls in the area of Orange and Chandler.
Get a hold of Hotch.
Tell him to bring the team and any S.D. Cops he can round up.
This is his truck.
留意有电话线杆的地方
He's around here.
Let me out. Let me out.
875 Orange, Hotch. Back door.
Never acknowledge me. Never...think of me.
I'll shoot her.
No, you won't, Franklin.
Yes, I will.
If you hurt her, I'll kill you.
I'll just say we caught a low-life burglar.
You didn't turn out to be Tommy after all.
You will remain uncaught.
你就会一文不值
他们会做一档电视节目
那个"杀手汤米"最后怎样了
Why'd he disappear?"
Then they'll stop talking about it altogether.
Put the gun down.
Come on. Walk outta here with me.
I'll make sure your face is splashed
across every newspaper and TV in the country.
Tommy killer: Franklin Graney.
Everyone will see you then.
达摩[杀人狂] 格兰尼
Whole world will know who you are.
It's up to you, Franklin.
或者继续做你的隐形人
You'll tell everyone?
I have a media specialist outside right now.
It is your choice.
Promise?
Yes, sir. I promise.
Back away from the gun.
Where's my baby? My baby!
He's fine. He's just fine.
You're ok.
Thank you.
It's ok.
It's ok.
Rose Kennedy once said,
"Birds sing after a storm.
"Why shouldn't people feel as free
to delight in whatever sunlight remains to them?"
Oh, I almost forgot. I have something for you.
Oh, yeah?
Forgot to give it to you at the party.
But you don't give birthday presents.
The "Red....Skins."
It's a V.I.P. Box.
Thank you so much.
Every been to a pro football game?
No, I honestly didn't even know this was football.
You're gonna love it.
你跟我一起去 对吗
No.
Someone else on the plane is a huge Skins fan.
Who?
Only person in the world who calls you Spence.
JJ?
She's a huge RedSkins fan.
Wh-what should I say?
Checkmate.
Heard you're, uh, a fan of football.
