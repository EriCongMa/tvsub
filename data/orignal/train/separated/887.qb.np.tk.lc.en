&quot; ferris bueller &apos;s day off . &quot;
the epic &apos; 80s teen movie
by the epic &apos; 80s teen @-@ movie director john hughes .
ferris was effortlessly cool , confident , and charismatic ,
and every teenage boy wanted to be him ,
especially me and barry .
you &apos;re abe froman ?
that &apos;s right . i &apos;m abe froman .
the sausage king of chicago ?
yeah . that &apos;s me .
oh my god ! ferris is so awesome .
one day , i &apos;m gonna eat in a fancy restaurant .
and one day , i &apos;m gonna be able to pull off this beret ,
just like ferris .
never ! only i can pull that off !
give me mom &apos;s beret !
yep , we constantly fought about
which one of us was most like ferris .
are you kidding me right now ?
in what world are you the ferris ?
duh -- we &apos;re both cool , we both date hot ladies ,
and we both have horrible sisters .
all of that applies to me , too .
if anything , you &apos;re the sickly , goober best friend , cameron .
me ?
you &apos;re the emotional wreck
who wears a hockey jersey all the time .
that &apos;s classic cameron , dude .
don &apos;t you dare call me the cameron , cameron !
i &apos;m ferris , bro . deal with it .
deal with this .
but in reality , i wasn &apos;t ferris .
i was this .
hey , guys ! want to be in the school &apos;s video time capsule ?
it &apos;ll be a learning tool for future generations .
yeah , you &apos;re a learning tool for all generations .
good one .
dude , enough with the camera .
it &apos;s creepy and intrusive and weird -- just like you .
thank you for the feedback .
while i knew i was miles from ferris ,
barry lived in a straight @-@ up fantasyland .
&apos;sup , math club ?
calcu @-@ later !
&apos;sup , band geeks ?
staying out of treble ?
i have no idea who you are .
hey , lover girl !
how ya been ?
awful . i just got voted onto the homecoming court .
we made it ? ! yes !
i &apos;m gonna need a big crown , you know .
&apos;cause i have a huge head .
oh , wow . you really , um , misread that badly .
you lost -- like , big @-@ time .
anthony balsamo won in a landslide .
wait .
you and your dreamy ex @-@ boyfriend
are sharing a float in the parade ?
together ? !
that &apos;s the most romantic of all modes of transportation !
chill ! we were a disaster when we dated .
we never talked . all we did was make out .
this is not getting better !
um , you &apos;re on the homecoming court ?
i thought we agreed it was for stupid , lame losers .
it &apos;s totally for stupid , lame losers .
then why are you doing it ?
i wanted to be a part of it .
yeah , well , so do i !
but you &apos;re not supposed to admit it .
so ... are we still sure that i didn &apos;t win ?
yes !
all right . i &apos;m gonna go help make the float .
so lame ... and fun .
this sucks !
i can &apos;t compete with anthony balsamo .
he &apos;s a dreamboat .
well , if it makes you feel better ,
you and lainey lasted way longer than i thought .
well , i &apos;m gonna be even more dreamboatier
than anthony balsamo .
i &apos;m gonna be ... ferris bueller .
it &apos;s time i have an epic day off .
good luck , knob . mom will catch you in two seconds .
spoken like ferris &apos; shockingly unlikable sister ,
jennifer grey .
i want out of this family .
that &apos;s literally something jennifer grey says .
a day off is exactly what i need to get my mojo back .
life moves pretty fast .
if you don &apos;t stop and look around once in a while ,
you could miss it .
again , dude , i don &apos;t know who you are .
i &apos;m ferris bueller !
god ! read a book !
it was april 27 , 1980 @-@ something ,
and my loving smother was walking in
on yet another mess she had to clean up .
i was gone for two minutes ! what the hell happened in here ?
we wanted milkshakes ,
and we couldn &apos;t find the lid to the blender ,
so we just used barry &apos;s hands .
it did not work .
the lid was right here . you didn &apos;t even look for it .
i don &apos;t know why i put up with you . i --
&quot; i could have been a lawyer . &quot;
my mom used that catchphrase to remind us
of the imaginary career she &apos;d given up to raise us .
stop folding so loudly ! we can &apos;t hear the tv !
you know , i did not sign up for this .
i could &apos;ve been a lawyer !
this is the third time i &apos;m calling you down for dinner !
stop ignoring your mother !
i could &apos;ve been a lawyer !
you know i could have been a lawyer ?
don &apos;t get fresh .
i &apos;ve given up everything for you people .
no offense , but being a lawyer &apos;s like a whole thing ,
and you only went to one semester of college .
i don &apos;t believe this .
i would like nothing more
than to be out there in the workforce
with my shoulder @-@ padded power suit
and my thermos full of homemade soup --
maybe chicken noodle or maybe a nice bisque .
or stew .
probably stew .
and we &apos;re back to cooking again .
admit it -- you complain about doing mom stuff ,
but you secretly love it .
i &apos;ll have you know that virginia kremp has been trying
to get me to work part time at the flower shop for years ,
and i think it &apos;s time i finally take her up on it .
as of tomorrow , i will officially start my second job .
what &apos;s your first job ?
being a mom !
unbelievable .
tomorrow , i am going to work , no matter what happens .
how could this happen ?
murray , feel his hands . they &apos;re cold and clammy .
i don &apos;t want to get sick .
i &apos;m fine .
i &apos;ll get up .
not a chance , mister .
don &apos;t you worry .
mama &apos;s gonna stay right here and nurse you back to health .
no !
i mean ... no .
are you seriously buying this bullcrap ?
i mean , he told me in school he would do this .
he &apos;s faking it , like ferris bueller .
erica ?
is that you ?
please don &apos;t be upset with me .
you have your health . be thankful .
that &apos;s literally a line from the movie !
please just watch the movie . it &apos;s all in the movie .
we don &apos;t have time to watch movies right now .
clearly , your brother is very sick and needs his rest .
now go eat breakfast and get to school . move !
bevy , it &apos;s your first day of work .
i &apos;m not gonna let the moron ruin it .
i &apos;ll stay with him , okay ?
but he needs constant care .
all you &apos;ll do is loaf around in your chair ,
watch hours of television , and eat whatever you want .
in that moment , my dad realized my mom was right .
this could be his day off , too .
i &apos;m incredibly offended .
just to prove you wrong , i will stay with barry all day .
feel better , but don &apos;t stop needing me !
they bought it .
the key to faking out the parents is the clammy hands .
you fake a stomach cramp ,
and when you &apos;re bent over moaning ,
you lick your palms .
it &apos;s a little childish , but , hey --
stop !
i told you , man -- stop touching my camera !
you &apos;re not ferris !
now all barry had to do was outsmart my old man .
later .
have fun with your thing , erica .
that part was beyond easy .
next , barry headed over to pops &apos; retirement community
to pick up some sweet wheels .
hey . how you doin &apos; ?
barry goldberg .
give me your firebird .
okay .
i ... didn &apos;t expect that .
okay .
thing is , is i &apos;m skipping school ,
and you can &apos;t tell anyone .
that may be a little difficult .
i &apos;m taking the day off , too .
what ? ! you &apos;re stealing my thing !
your thing ? i &apos;m the one that needs the day off .
you &apos;re a dumb kid ! your problems are meaningless .
it &apos;s been brought to my attention
that my whole being might not be well @-@ received at school .
just like cameron .
admit it . admit you &apos;re the cameron .
my leopard vest and boyish charm say otherwise .
that &apos;s my look ! i &apos;m ferris !
enough . i &apos;ll be the camden .
the two of you can be the fergus .
does that mean you &apos;ll help us ?
normally , i wouldn &apos;t let you kids skip school ,
but let &apos;s be honest -- you both need a day off .
well , then , let &apos;s hit the road .
if you have the means ,
i highly recommend picking one up .
i did . it &apos;s mine .
do you have a kiss for daddy ?
not now , barry . i just got a call .
my grandmother passed .
that was me !
i called the school so you could skip .
wait -- so meemaw &apos;s not dead ?
no !
i assume not .
i don &apos;t have eyes on her , but most likely .
oh , my god . what is wrong with you ?
it &apos;s what ferris does , and everyone loves him for it .
idiot !
lainey &apos;s grandmother helped raise her ,
and you just told the school
that she got flattened by a semi .
come on . i need my sloane .
i even got you a distracting white fringe jacket .
i can &apos;t leave , okay ? it &apos;s homecoming .
plus , i have to call my aunt
and tell her that her mother is alive .
you suck at this .
shut up !
but he &apos;s right . let &apos;s just go home .
no ! we got a day off to have , kiddo .
wait -- you &apos;re actually encouraging them both
to skip school ?
sorry , sweetheart . they need this .
god , i am so sick of everyone bending over backwards
for these two losers because they fail at life .
whatever , jennifer grey .
have fun in school while we live it up .
fine ! you want me to be jennifer grey , you &apos;ll get her .
but not the awesome one in &quot; dirty
and that was my fringe jacket !
after a bit of a shaky start ,
barry &apos;s day off was under way .
with me at his side , we would take philly by storm
and relive the movie .
first up was the museum .
where are the boobs ?
where are the boobs ?
where are the boobs ?
unfortunately , trying to re @-@ create your favorite scene
from a movie isn &apos;t as easy as you &apos;d think .
just take my hand !
stranger danger !
hey ! come here !
it &apos;s from a movie !
next up was the phillies , and it was gonna be legendary .
hey , batter ! hey , batter !
s @-@ wing , batter !
hey , butter ! hey , butter !
s @-@ weet , butter !
are you saying &quot; sweet butter &quot; ?
shut up . i don &apos;t know sports .
foul ball ! look alive , boys !
yes !
but , unfortunately for us ,
the day was becoming legendary for all the wrong reasons .
and we weren &apos;t the only ones struggling that day .
you okay ? you seem blue .
it &apos;s just ... barry &apos;s sick ,
and i feel really guilty being here .
aw , honey . welcome to being a working mama .
you want to get out of that house ,
and then when you do ,
you can &apos;t help but feel like you &apos;re missing out , right ?
thanks , ginny . it &apos;s nice to know i &apos;m not alone .
and here i was , ready to bail and go check on him .
come on .
oh , bev .
no , your family will still be there to love you when you get home .
that means a lot .
in fact , you &apos;ve inspired me .
i think i &apos;m gonna take the van and do some deliveries --
or whatever it is you do with a van .
&apos;kay . bye .
wait ! you forgot the flowers !
as my mom was ditching the first day of her new job ,
we were making a last @-@ ditch effort
to get a tiny taste of ferris bueller .
keep it close , pal .
hello . may i help you ?
yes , my good man .
i am abe froman ,
the cheesesteak king of philadelphia .
and i am gabe froman , the emperor of soft pretzels .
get out of here ! you &apos;re terrible !
take it easy , ferguses .
hmm . i don &apos;t see those names on my list .
but that &apos;s fine .
we have a beautiful table for you right by the window .
you &apos;re gonna seat us just like that ?
he just said he &apos;s the pretzel emperor .
that &apos;s not even a thing .
well , we pride ourselves on accommodating all of our guests .
so , if you &apos;ll follow me --
no , sir , i will not follow you !
make it difficult for us to sit .
yeah ! we need to outsmart you with our comedic shenanigans .
i &apos;m sorry . i don &apos;t understand what &apos;s happening right now .
you &apos;re supposed to act snooty and threaten to call the police .
i would never call the police .
now , if you and the pretzel emperor will follow me --
call the police ! i demand it !
don &apos;t call the police .
call the police !
don &apos;t call the police .
we &apos;ll just get our car from valet .
we don &apos;t have a valet .
then you better call the police .
and with one simple toss of the keys ...
keep it close , pal .
... barry was completely robbed of his day off .
unlike the movie , the firebird was never seen again .
even worse , my mom was flying home
to give her sick little schmoopie some tlc .
ow ! i hurt my bottom !
but she had promised my dad
she wouldn &apos;t walk through that front door
to go see barry before the workday was done .
so instead , she decided to climb the trellis
and go through the window .
oh , poop !
mama &apos;s coming , baby .
oh , it &apos;s in my pantyhose ! damn it !
we are definitely overwatering this lawn .
my pedicure !
how &apos;s work going ?
i told you -- he &apos;s fine .
something &apos;s wrong . he didn &apos;t come to the window .
i &apos;ve got to get up there and put my lips on his forehead .
it &apos;s the only way to get an accurate temperature .
you can &apos;t stay away , can you ?
you &apos;re crazy .
if stealing a van and trying to break into my own home
so i can snuggle my boy is crazy ,
then i don &apos;t want to be sane .
you stole a van ?
no time to explain , mostly &apos; cause it makes me look bad .
barry needs me !
luckily , my brother had followed the movie to a &quot; t &quot;
and rigged an elaborate pulley system to a mannequin
to fake out my mom .
see ? the kid &apos;s totally fine .
really ?
but beverly goldberg was a lot smarter than the mom in the movie .
hello ?
barry &apos;s ditching school .
thank you for telling me nothing of note .
did you even hear what i said ?
yes , narc . i &apos;m also ditching work .
are you gonna tattle on me , too ?
but i -- - get back to class , or you &apos;re grounded .
what do you mean , the car &apos;s already been reported stolen ?
the question is , how did you know it was stolen ?
i didn &apos;t .
i mean , i did , because i reported it ,
but i didn &apos;t really .
i &apos;m gonna go .
no , you &apos;re gonna wait for someone to come and question you .
drugs ?
thank you , no . i &apos;m good .
no , i meant are you in here for drugs ?
no .
why are you here ?
drugs .
so , you gonna tell me your story or what ?
fine . you want to know what &apos;s wrong ?
i know what &apos;s wrong . i just want to hear you say it .
in a nutshell , i hate my brothers .
they think my life is so easy ,
but i have problems , like everyone else .
like what ?
my friend got on the homecoming court ,
and i didn &apos;t go out for it
because we both agreed it &apos;s stupid .
well , then , what &apos;s the problem ?
i don &apos;t know .
i guess , deep down , i really wanted to be on it .
then why didn &apos;t you go for it ?
if there &apos;s one thing i know ,
being on the junior royal court opens a lot of doors .
&apos;cause it &apos;s lame .
and i didn &apos;t want people to make fun of me .
but i guess that &apos;s what i do .
instead of taking risks , i just keep my head down .
maybe that &apos;s why barry bothers me so much .
he &apos;s not afraid to look like an idiot .
well , if you ask me ,
you ought to spend more time worrying about yourself
and less time worrying about your brother .
all right , you &apos;re free to go .
it &apos;s about time .
feels like i &apos;ve been sitting here for 30 years .
meanwhile , barry became so depressed
that he &apos;d never be ferris bueller ,
he became catatonic .
come on . it &apos;s not that bad .
we had a great day .
barry went comatose ,
we got pelted with garbage on national tv ,
and someone stole your car .
enough !
you can &apos;t force a perfect day .
you got to just go out and live it the best way you can
as you -- no one else .
that &apos;s exactly what ferris would say .
great .
even our 80 @-@ year @-@ old grandfather is cooler than us .
man . look at the guy .
i think he blew a microchip .
you okay , kiddo ?
blink if you can hear me .
did he just -- - yep .
i &apos;m coming , schmoopie !
let my body be your life preserver !
just like ferris had been relentlessly tracked down
by principal rooney ,
barry had been tracked down by my mom .
hold on to my bosom and kick with your legs .
please ! i was about to hit bottom !
let me breathe air into your lungs .
gross !
it was official --
barry &apos;s day off was a total failure .
and even worse , my mom ended up grounding him for a month .
* when barry was in egypt &apos;s land *
* let my barry go *
you okay ?
i &apos;m dying .
dude , get up . it &apos;s homecoming .
you got to be there for lainey .
what &apos;s the point ? i &apos;m grounded .
maybe ferris can sneak out , but not me .
not cameron .
what if i told you that ferris isn &apos;t even real ?
i know . it &apos;s just a movie .
that &apos;s not what i mean .
there &apos;s this theory
that he &apos;s just a figment of cameron &apos;s imagination .
that would make cameron the hero
and ferris just the guy he wants to be .
so ... even if i &apos;m cameron , i can still be ferris ?
exactly .
why are you cheering me up ?
i met a dude who made me take a good look at myself .
just then , my brother realized erica was right .
maybe barry was cameron , but that didn &apos;t mean
he didn &apos;t have a little ferris in him , too .
come on . let &apos;s go to homecoming .
you said you were grounded .
hey , i &apos;m barry goldberg ,
and if anyone can outsmart mom , it &apos;s me .
later !
have fun with your thing , erica .
once again , barry had no problem sneaking past my dad .
squishy , i know you &apos;re grounded ,
but that doesn &apos;t mean mama doesn &apos;t love you .
and for 30 seconds , he had slightly fooled my mom .
boyfriend a no @-@ show , huh ?
call me old @-@ fashioned ,
but a guy who stands you up deserves to get cheated on .
* oh , shake it up , baby , now *
oh , no .
* twist and shout *
* come on , come on , come on , come on , baby , now *
* come on and work it on out *
* well , work it on out , honey *
* you know you look so good *
this isn &apos;t what i meant , you dope !
* you know you got me going now *
even though barry was making a fool of himself ,
something happened he never expected .
every single person in that audience
loved ferris bueller , too .
uh , who is that crazy dude ?
that &apos;s my boyfriend .
he &apos;s doing it .
he &apos;s actually doing it .
i &apos;ll go get him .
no . let him go .
sometimes moms need to know when to take a day off , too .
sing , baby , sing !
that &apos;s when my mom realized
there was a reason she wasn &apos;t a lawyer --
she already had the best job in the world .
as for me , i realized
i didn &apos;t want to be ferris bueller or cameron
or anyone else in the movie .
i wanted to be the guy
who sat behind the camera , making it .
i wanted to be john hughes .
of course , no one could be , but i might as damn well try .
that &apos;s the thing about the movies we grow up with --
we always wish we could be part of the fantasy .
and for one brief moment , my brother actually was .
you &apos;re still here ?
it &apos;s over .
go .
go home . get out of here .
i don &apos;t get why i &apos;m doing this .
trust me -- this will make you famous one day .
that &apos;s it , go home , get out here .
we &apos;re done , good bye .
