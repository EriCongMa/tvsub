will you tell ?
no . no .
please .
will you tell ? !
no .
this is all your fault .
i &apos;m sorry , mr. stanley .
i never expected so many customers .
yeah ?
you and your menu additions are making my life hell , rizzoli .
hey , hey , hey , zip it .
and it &apos;s mrs. rizzoli to you , stanley .
that &apos;s it .
you gave me too much .
no , that &apos;s -- that &apos;s okay . that &apos;s for you .
thank you . have a good day .
you &apos;re running this morning . come on .
you &apos;re too late . i already showered .
last night or this morning ?
never mind . let &apos;s go .
no , i @-@ i can &apos;t . my stomach &apos;s full .
jane , you need endorphins from physical activity ...
because you &apos;re depressed .
i &apos;m not depressed .
see ?
you &apos;ll get over casey .
who said it had anything to do with casey ?
i @-@ i got a new ... ding in my car door .
you lied . your left eyebrow moved .
you are in stage four of the five stages of relationship grief .
i am in stage five of ignoring you .
i can &apos;t taste , touch , smell ...
see , or hear you .
denial , anger , bargaining , depression , acceptance .
a good run will get you to acceptance .
why &apos;d she have to make bunnies ?
mnh @-@ mnh . i like them bunnies .
taste better when they got a shape .
you know what ? take these , too .
you sure ?
yeah .
&apos;cause i don &apos;t want you losing any more weight .
you know , i like my detectives with a little meat on them .
rizzoli , get over here .
we &apos;re too busy for table service .
i was just getting a to @-@ go container for this gentleman .
you heard that ? gentleman .
rondo , hurry .
you &apos;ve been giving free food to rondo ,
and that &apos;s why the sandwiches cost 12 bucks .
i take it out of my tip money , detective .
that man &apos;s been through a lot .
leave him alone .
oh . we got a murder .
you gonna run to the crime scene ?
five minutes .
three .
read my lips .
get your ass back in the seat and get this bus in service .
nobody tells me when to drive .
he &apos;s a transit cop . it &apos;s not even his crime scene .
it &apos;s ours .
i know him -- arite mcmurphy
he &apos;s always irritable .
his wife ran off with her boyfriend years ago
or maybe died , something like that .
something like that ?
yeah , i think they had a kid .
so you two were close .
must have been 10 years ago .
no , had to be 20 . i was still in the drug unit .
let me know if you need help finding your car .
oh . she looks like some ... big weird doll .
dame de voyage .
why are we speaking french ?
sex dolls originated in the 17th century .
randy sailors took them on lonely voyages .
but this might be agalmatophilia .
anything ending in &quot; philia &quot; is not gonna be good .
a fetish involving the love between a man and a doll .
a man , a doll , his love , and what ?
a 2x4 ? a hammer ? hockey stick ?
definitely a solid high @-@ density object .
in common parlance , something hard .
that &apos;s a brilliant deduction .
her wrists were bound to something .
there was no cast @-@ off or blood spatter .
she wasn &apos;t killed here . nice scrunchie .
yeah , her clothes are very early &apos; 90s , too .
more formal before sweeping changes to fashion made grunge chic .
and you &apos;re telling me this because why ?
she was transported here from the &apos; 90s ?
uh , no , detective smarty pants .
because her clothes are 20 years old ,
and they don &apos;t fit her .
hey , sorry i &apos;m late . breakfast line was long .
got to help your mom set up that online ordering .
all right , as soon as you &apos;re
done swallowing the peter rabbit pancake ,
can you go through the suitcase , please ?
this is too easy .
it &apos;s all here -- driver &apos;s license ,
bus pass , cash , phone .
victoria green . she &apos;s 25 .
she lived in brighton .
okay . not so easy .
she password @-@ protected her phone .
hmm , okay .
so , she was probably killed wearing that .
the killer redressed her in those clothes .
and posed her on a bus bench .
so we &apos;re not looking for just any old killer .
we &apos;re looking for a freak with a doll fetish .
where is korsak ?
is the owner chasing you ?
i &apos;m just gonna head on back
- you &apos;re not going anywhere until you tell us
what you &apos;re doing with that dog .
how did you rip your pants ?
oh , man . these are new .
yeah , new in 1995 .
stealing somebody &apos;s dog is a felony .
i didn &apos;t steal her .
i &apos;m just taking care of barney miller
until i can find her a good home .
barney miller ?
she was ... i rescued her .
she was trapped and crying . somebody abandoned her .
i &apos;m not visiting you when they send you to walpole .
i will . i will visit you .
there are remnants of a subdural hematoma
just above the right ear .
she was knocked out with what ?
and don &apos;t say &quot; something hard . &quot;
it was hard .
but the extent of the damage
makes it impossible to determine the type of instrument used .
was she raped ?
doubtful .
there &apos;s no evidence of trauma , tearing , or bruising .
doubtful ? so you found something .
well , she did have sex within the last 36 hours .
okay , what &apos;s with the creepy doll makeup ?
it was applied postmortem .
see the blood under the makeup ?
mm @-@ hmm . maybe a sex game gone wrong ?
well , the killer did exhibit a certain degree of tenderness .
oh , yeah , real tender , starting with tenderizing her head .
got a suspect -- herbert buckley .
served two years on an a &amp; b ,
released two months ago .
he liked to hire hookers and make them pretend they were dolls .
and hit them in the head with a crowbar . nice .
can you use frankie ?
i &apos;m just not up for a pervert today .
see you , maura .
psst ! hey , doc .
what ? sergeant korsak . are you all right ?
i was , uh , wondering if , uh --
if you could give a friend of mine a little checkup ?
here ?
there &apos;s no such thing as a little checkup .
i &apos;d have to
hello .
man , this is a downer .
herbert goes at marlene all the time .
she never called the cops before .
who &apos;s marlene ?
herbert &apos;s old lady .
yeah , you bet i &apos;m frustrated !
i got mushrooms on my burger , and i hate them !
that would be herbert .
and now you got sprouts all in my ketchup !
stay back .
i &apos;m going left . you take right .
boston police , freeze .
no . no , no . we were just talking .
we were just working through our issues .
baby , i love you . i would never hurt you . tell them .
are you hurt ?
no .
we were just working on our relationship .
i @-@ i wasn &apos;t gonna hit her .
uh ... oh , hey , easy , bro . don &apos;t , uh ... cry .
it &apos;s marlene .
she hates to be alone . i can &apos;t leave her alone .
take her , frankie .
i don &apos;t know where she &apos;s been . you take her .
barney miller is in excellent health .
watch this .
bring me my keys , barney miller .
bring me my keys .
oh . thank you .
turn off the lights .
turn off the lights , barney miller .
good girl . yeah .
look what i found .
oh , an rfid scanner .
thanks , susie .
well , if barney miller is chipped ,
this will tell us who she belongs to .
she &apos;s registered to the truce veteran center .
are you a service dog , barney ?
that &apos;s why you know all those tricks .
i guess a wounded warrior needs you more than i do .
yeah .
why don &apos;t i take barney miller home ?
spare you that .
would you ? i don &apos;t think i can do it .
goodbye , girl .
oh , wait . uh , barney miller .
elsie ?
good girl .
look at you .
maura .
casey .
hi .
hi .
how &apos;d you get your collar off again ?
sergeant korsak found her not too far from here .
is she yours ?
uh , she &apos;s , um -- she &apos;s one of our service dogs .
as you can see , she &apos;s pretty adept at opening doors .
you have cauda equina syndrome , don &apos;t you ?
how did it happen ?
roadside bomb .
i &apos;m partially paralyzed .
a colleague of mine is heading up the boston clinical trials
for a new spinal @-@ regeneration technique.if ...
i know . i &apos;m on the waiting list .
you should tell jane .
no . and you won &apos;t , either -- ever .
you have to promise me that .
i don &apos;t know that i can make that promise .
she &apos;s my friend .
if you &apos;re her friend , you won &apos;t tell her .
casey , a lot of couples
cope with very serious war injuries .
yeah , hang out with me here ,
meet some of those couples .
see what an injury like mine
does to girlfriends , wives , families .
jane is suffering .
it &apos;s mean not to tell her .
the truth is easier than what she &apos;s imagining .
i came back here
to see if i could get into the clinical trials .
i didn &apos;t come back for jane .
just finished interrogating herbert .
that is one very strange man ... and woman .
herbert was looking pretty good for it until the landlord said
old herb was yelling at marlene all night .
hey . excuse me .
that &apos;s my chair you &apos;re sit-- god !
what is --
that is not funny ! who put that there ?
that is marlene , herb &apos;s old lady .
get it out of my chair .
oh , man . - what ? what &apos;s -- what &apos;s wrong with you ?
barney miller &apos;s gone .
aww ! don &apos;t be sad .
marlene is winking at you .
she might like leashes , too .
show some respect .
to a mannequin ?
to elsie .
that &apos;s barney miller &apos;s real name .
you knew that dog for two hours .
she works with vets
struggling with ptsd at ...
at ?
at , uh , the program where
lieutenant colonel jones works .
really ? yeah , well , that &apos;s -- that &apos;s interesting .
herb is downstairs crying like a baby .
he &apos;s wrapped himself around the security station .
he won &apos;t leave without ... marlene .
don &apos;t let the size @-@ 2 jeans fool you .
that bitch is heavy .
wow ! marlene &apos;s no cheap date , either .
8 grand ?
damn !
of course , if you amortize , that might be cheaper than a wife .
plus , you get a woman who doesn &apos;t talk .
oh , great . thank you , moe , curly , larry .
excuse me , curly , could you take marlene out of here , please ?
certainly .
and you , larry ,
did you unlock the password on victim &apos;s smartphone yet ?
can &apos;t crack the password , but i &apos;ll keep trying .
what about you , moe ?
monthly bus pass won &apos;t tell us anything .
bcat doesn &apos;t track usage .
16 bytes per sector are
reserved for keys and access conditions
and cannot normally be used for user data .
beep . i am a robot .
beep . i do not ... compute human talk .
i do not use that inflection .
and that is the storage space on a bcat card .
that &apos;s riveting .
i &apos;m going to the gym .
and even though you &apos;re rude , you &apos;re coming with me .
no . thank you . i &apos;m too tired to work out .
then let &apos;s go to the dirty robber .
i &apos;ll even have a beer with you .
no , i &apos;m gonna go work out on my couch .
five stages of junk food .
uh , uh , i mentioned casey .
you think that &apos;s what &apos;s got her down ?
i &apos;d only be guessing .
hey , come see what detective frost set up for me .
now all my customers can order online .
oh , wow . this is great .
i &apos;m worried about jane .
it &apos;s as bad as when
andrew spagnola broke her heart
at the shining star prom .
you have to swear that you will never mention to jane
what i &apos;m about to tell you .
that &apos;s , uh , &quot; gray &apos;s anatomy . &quot;
对圣经发誓即对自己的良心发誓
swear , angela .
i swear my lips are sealed .
i went to see casey .
okay . i can &apos;t tell you .
no .
i promise . talk .
he &apos;s partially paralyzed .
he doesn &apos;t want jane to know .
partially paralyzed ?
does that mean he can &apos;t have children ?
angela .
what ?
i want a grandkid , and jane is -- is crazy for him .
there is a small chance that he may regain function someday ,
but he &apos;s -- he &apos;s pretty resolute .
he doesn &apos;t want to see her .
well , then he &apos;s a fool .
i could tell she really liked him .
i think she loves him .
man , you still haven &apos;t cracked the password on her phone ?
thanks .
give it up .
hey , maybe the d.o.j. will let you borrow that kid
that hacked into the pentagon .
i &apos;ll get it .
while you were playing with that cellphone ,
i did some actual work .
i went to victoria &apos;s apartment .
locked up tight , nothing disturbed .
she moved here from atlanta to take a job
at an accounting firm -- ron montgomery associates .
is her office anywhere near where we found her body ?
no . castlegate towers in jamaica plain .
and we don &apos;t know where
she was last seen ?
nope .
she had a bus pass . you look at the bus drivers on the route
between her office and her apartment ?
no ! gee !
didn &apos;t think of that .
yes , i checked the route she might have taken
and all 73 others .
drivers working that day and night checked out .
oh , yeah ! yes !
i am good . i &apos;m finally in .
i think i know why our victim was deleting all her texts . uh @-@ oh .
yeah , she was a sexter .
and she was sexting with someone named &quot; r. &quot;
oh , my . &quot; r &quot; wasn &apos;t shy , was he ?
must be running for congress .
&quot; r &quot; for ron ?
ron montgomery associates ?
&quot; ron montgomery runs a family company
with family friendly values . &quot;
i remember when that meant
you weren &apos;t a pervert .
she was new , but she was a good employee .
you send your picture to all your good employees ?
oh , that .
uh , uh , no , we were -- we were just having some innocent fun .
yeah , looks real innocent .
no . i didn &apos;t do that .
i @-@ i @-@ i could never do something like that .
but you did have sex with her , didn &apos;t you ?
no . no , we didn &apos;t . i &apos;m married .
and we have evidence that victoria had sex with someone
the day she died .
you have evidence ?
yeah , a little semen .
which is full of dna , so why don &apos;t we just
do a cheek swab and make sure it &apos;s not your dna .
okay . no , we had sex . we had sex .
it was consensual
and it was on her lunch hour .
&apos;cause you can &apos;t have her fooling around on company time .
she was lonely . it wasn &apos;t serious .
it is now . when did you leave work ?
um ... i left before she did .
you -- you can check with security .
i used my key card in the parking garage .
where did you go after that ?
straight home .
we &apos;ve got another one .
probably happened last night .
get frankie . check those security tapes in his building .
make sure his story checks out .
more &apos; 90s clothing .
it takes a lot of rage to do that to somebody &apos;s head .
blunt @-@ force trauma . hmm . remarkable .
it is the same .
what ? same weapon ?
same scrunchie .
so our victims were either transported from the &apos; 90s
or they work for hillary clinton
or our killer was a scrunchie freak .
all her i.d. , bus pass .
diane campbell .
she lived downtown on tremont street .
well , that &apos;s nowhere near
where our first victim lived or worked .
nowhere near here , either .
yeah , no wonder they &apos;re scared .
somebody &apos;s hunting young women .
hey , can i get my bagel toasted ?
i rue the day i gave you a job , rizzoli --
rue it .
you hear me ?
uh , you ordered some coffee ? yeah .
no one is using my online menu .
i &apos;m gonna lose my job .
the traffic isn &apos;t getting on to the interweb roads .
how do i do that ?
okay , uh , don &apos;t panic .
people are attracted to sites that have a gimmick or content .
you mean like a raffle for a steak dinner
or a bahamas getaway ?
you &apos;ll be on permanent getaway
if you don &apos;t stop talking with the customers .
i was thinking something more along the lines of a blog .
something people see every day .
you think i &apos;m gonna see my food sometime this year ?
yes , of course , sir .
hey , ma .
i thought you said things were gonna go faster in here .
we were just working out a few glitches .
mm @-@ hmm . right .
so , did our sexter &apos;s story check out ?
and what was on the security tapes ?
frankie &apos;s still looking .
frost , doesn &apos;t it feel like we &apos;re missing something ?
time of death for both victims was around midnight .
the cause of death sure looks the same .
we got the doll pose , the makeup ,
the &apos; 90s clothing , suitcases .
but they had nothing in common .
i mean , the only link is the monthly bus passes ,
but they didn &apos;t take the same buses ,
and all the drivers were clean .
wait a minute . what about the passengers ?
what if the killer is riding the bus
and randomly targeting young working women ?
thanks , ma .
yep , that &apos;s ronnie the sexter , all right ,
driving out of his business &apos;s garage at 7 : 58 .
nice work , frankie .
what &apos;s so nice about it ?
it just confirms the guy &apos;s story .
frankie &apos;s good at this . he &apos;s got more .
wait for it .
and we &apos;re waiting for what ?
a 21 @-@ gun salute
because you did a little detective work ?
i &apos;m doing a lot of detecting work
for someone who doesn &apos;t have his gold badge .
hmm , i think i detect some whining .
this is from a security camera
across the street from montgomery &apos;s office building .
wow . so , we get to watch him drive out from a different angle .
you know what i love about you ?
you &apos;re always so up @-@ beat and supportive .
you see that ?
ron montgomery pulls up in front just as victoria ,
victim number one , leaves the building .
yeah , then they argue ... right here .
hmm . he &apos;s got some game .
looks like she &apos;s giving in .
and getting in his car .
so ron montgomery &apos;s not only a cheater .
he &apos;s also a liar .
look , when i heard that victoria was dead ,
i @-@ i didn &apos;t want to be involved .
oh , okay . no worries . you &apos;re not involved .
you were the last one seen with
a woman who was found with her skull bashed in .
we &apos;re so sorry to bother you .
how about her ?
were you not involved with her , either ?
what are you doing ? i @-@ i don &apos;t even know who that is .
i didn &apos;t do that .
why were you fighting with victoria the night she was murdered ?
she found out that i &apos;m not really separated .
and i was giving her a ride home ,
trying to explain , but she was so upset .
she made me pull over near allendale circle
and she got out of the car ,
and that &apos;s the last time that i saw her .
that &apos;s miles from where victoria lived .
and then where &apos;d you go ?
the blue tassel .
uh , i was there ... i was there till closing .
ask the bartender , ned .
make yourself comfortable .
we &apos;ll be back .
there she goes .
not sure how far , though . look at those heels .
bartender confirms ronnie boy was there till 2 in the morning .
hey , wait . look .
she took a bus .
i think our bus theory is back .
i checked the backgrounds on all the bus drivers ,
but i think i &apos;ll go have a face @-@ to @-@ face with that one .
you remember her ?
she &apos;s the girl on the news .
always got on at forest hills , but the other night ,
i picked her up on allendale .
where were you two nights ago ?
got pulled off my route at 10 : 00
to fill in on the 117 bus in east boston .
worked until 1 : 00 in the morning . you can check .
thank you .
hello , vanilla .
angela &apos;s guardians ?
mrs. vanilla takes good care of us ,
so when she put out the call ...
uh , call ? what call ?
to protect the young women of the city ,
make the buses safe again .
why is my mother in the middle of everything ?
maura &apos;s found something big .
just be safe .
this was embedded
in the parietal lobe of diane campbell &apos;s brain .
a piece of a toothpick ?
big splinter .
i am prepared to say it is a sliver of wood .
yeah , korsak , how could you
possibly think that a sliver was a splinter ?
see this ?
this stain is actually from two blood types --
ab @-@ positive ,
which matches victim number one , victoria green ,
and o @-@ negative ,
which is a match with victim number two , diane campbell .
so the splinter --
precise terminology .
is the sliver from the murder weapon ?
oh , doesn &apos;t that look like her &quot; i &apos;ve got a secret &quot; face .
i found a third blood type .
you want us to believe
there are three types of blood on that sliver ?
well , it is a big sliver .
and one other thing .
the third blood sample is 20 years old .
have you been drinking ?
yes . water .
two liters a day , as recommended by the mayo clinic .
you couldn &apos;t possibly tell how old that speck of blood is .
yes , i can . it &apos;s simple .
a laser excites the tryptophan until it fluoresces .
ticktock .
well , you asked .
jane , that sliver could be a piece of the murder weapon .
that our killer used on someone else 20 years ago .
you got enough for a dna profile ?
i have the results from the trace section .
oh , thank you .
the sliver is white ash .
so ... we could be looking for a club made of white ash ?
our old nightsticks were white ash .
you think we &apos;re looking for a cop ?
who else is a young woman gonna trust , right ?
someone in a uniform .
these were phased out , but i kept mine .
so did a lot of guys .
we &apos;d be looking at an old @-@ timer ,
maybe retired ,
someone with a history of violence .
no , we didn &apos;t find anything in cold cases ,
and there were no murders with a similar m.o. in ncic
for the past 20 years .
i &apos;ll check on any cop who went to prison for assaults on women
or any domestic violence .
right . and maybe our killer &apos;s been released . he &apos;s back at it .
when i first come on the job ,
had to just about kill your wife to get charged with anything .
how many guys we tell to
take a walk around the block to cool off ?
had to see them punch the old lady .
the old lady ?
sorry . it was 30 years ago . i am sorry .
i had this little trick
where i used to piss off the old man
so he &apos;d come at me .
gave me a chance to discipline him .
hmm , you provoke the wife @-@ beaters
into picking on someone their own size .
ah , well , sometimes they were bigger .
i &apos;ve been thinking about what you said about him being tender .
casey ?
yeah , casey .
no , maura , the killer .
and stop saying that name .
exposure therapy might help you get over ... casey .
casey . casey .
stop it !
i &apos;m just trying to help .
if you want to play shrink , help me come up
with a psychological profile of this killer .
he &apos;s dissociated from reality .
he &apos;s constructed a world
in which an act of extreme violence ...
violently smashing women &apos;s heads in with a nightstick .
... is followed by a tender expression of love .
yeah , tenderly slapping on pancake makeup
and making them wear ugly @-@ ass clothes .
come on . i just got my heart rate up .
he dresses his victims up in 20 @-@ year @-@ old clothes .
maura , you found 20 @-@ year @-@ old blood .
that feels rather significant .
you think we ran long enough to need a shower ?
oh , gosh darn it .
i didn &apos;t get an endorphin hit yet .
that was a short run .
i &apos;m a fast runner . i thought of something .
what do we have on the cop theory .
we looked at all cops fired for domestic violence
over the last 20 years -- nothing that fits .
only found a few ex @-@ cops doing time ,
and none of them were released within the last year .
okay , i think our killer is re @-@ enacting a murder
he committed 20 years ago .
put on wzjt .
our young ladies are being stalked by a deranged killer .
it is up to me and my homis
to help the boston police department .
the police don &apos;t care ...
thank goodness the homies are on the case .
rizzoli , why the hell is your informant
the lead choirboy for your mother &apos;s homies ?
the police do care . they just can &apos;t be everywhere .
so angela &apos;s guardians are gonna be there .
well , it &apos;s gonna be angela &apos;s ashes when i &apos;m through .
look at this .
your mom is blogging about our case .
uh @-@ oh .
double uh @-@ oh .
damn . 12,104 followers .
yeah , you better hide .
you think he &apos;s gonna fire her ?
oh , i don &apos;t know . she really did it this time .
well , we got a situation .
&quot; angela &apos;s guardians are gonna be there . &quot;
yeah , and i &apos;m gonna be back in evidence management .
ooh . i don &apos;t think so .
how did she do that ?
one study found that when sniffing pumpkin pie
and lavender , men become sexually aroused .
maura !
not one word , rizzoli .
hey , ma . chatting with one of your virtual friends ?
did you see my blog ?
i &apos;m putting up a few more safety tips .
i have 12 followers so far .
you have 12,000 , ma .
i do ?
uh , 12,313 .
12,314 .
okay .
time to say goodbye to your 12,000 little friends .
we have to help her . she &apos;s so angry .
i have a very good idea .
uh , no , no . whatever it is you &apos;re thinking of doing , don &apos;t .
it is none of our business .
shut my mother &apos;s blog down now .
you sure ?
i never built a blog that had this kind of traffic .
do it or you &apos;ll be directing traffic .
all right , everything is significant to a serial killer .
he is not randomly targeting
and randomly dropping his victims at those bus stops .
yeah , but we checked everything .
if there was a body dropped at any of those bus stops
in the last 20 years , we &apos;d know about it .
korsak , we checked
for body drops near egleston square .
yeah .
but we didn &apos;t check incident reports .
you got something ?
maybe -- 20 years ago , a woman disappeared
from a store near egleston square .
&quot; libby mcmurphy was reported missing
&quot; from her store , libby &apos;s doll house and tea room ,
on august 22 , 1992 , by her mother , marion tibbets . &quot;
libby mcmurphy .
libby , i can forgive anything .
please come home for me ... for jonathan .
whatever you &apos;ve done ...
that &apos;s a hell of a memory you got there , korsak .
isn &apos;t that your friend , artie , the transit cop ?
yeah , artie mcmurphy . his wife was named libby .
well , son was 5 when she disappeared .
he &apos;d be 25 now .
frost , can you run the kid ,
johathan mcmurphy ?
already running him .
uh , no criminal , no dmv .
oh , wait . here &apos;s something .
tewksbury state hospital .
mental hospital . poor kid .
come home .
he &apos;s been there eight years .
maybe what happened to our two victims
also happened to his mother .
we &apos;d like to talk to you about your daughter .
why weren &apos;t you interested in what i had to say 20 years ago ?
i see you brought some photos .
is that libby and jonathan ?
yes , that &apos;s libby and jonathan at her store ,
libby &apos;s doll house and tea room .
jonathan loved it there .
is that -- what do you call them ?
a scrunchie , yeah .
libby gave them out as party favors .
those were happy days .
mrs. tibbets , we &apos;ve asked you here --
my libby didn &apos;t run off .
not that i &apos;d blame her , the way artie treated her .
artie was abusive ?
he was nice as pie at first .
but then after they were married ,
she started wearing long @-@ sleeve shirts to the shop
to hide the bruises .
made excuses for how clumsy she was .
my daughter never would have left jonathan behind
with that monster .
i kept the shop going until he took jonathan ,
and he locked him up in that horrible place .
these are love letters my daughter sent to artie .
i saved them .
libby kissed the envelopes .
i thought you might want her dna .
i watch a lot of crime shows .
thank you , mrs. tibbets .
12 excessive @-@ force complaints
all involving you using a nightstick .
liked to use it at home , too , didn &apos;t you ?
you &apos;re pissing in the wind , korsak .
you got no weapon , no motive , no dna .
we &apos;ve got a bloody piece of white @-@ ash wood
that i &apos;ll bet came from your nightstick .
you &apos;re a betting man , right , artie ?
would you like to also bet
that blood came from your missing wife ?
well , if you got that on me ,
i &apos;d be in cuffs instead of listening to your bullshit .
you gonna arrest me ?
that &apos;s what i thought .
don &apos;t hover . dna processing takes time .
well , we don &apos;t have time .
faster , maura . i need something .
you &apos;re breathing on me .
i don &apos;t believe this .
if that is a text
from a vacation club in acapulco , don &apos;t respond .
it might be a scam .
does this look like a scam ?
it &apos;s from casey .
he says he wants to meet for drinks tonight at the dirty robber .
the comparison test results for the two victims &apos; lipsticks
and the lipstick on that envelope .
thank you .
jane , i might have something .
libby mcmurphy used the same brand of lipstick
as our two victims .
i think we just tied artie to all three murders .
come on . i need you .
i think i know who that 20 @-@ year @-@ old blood belongs to .
nothing ?
did you find artie mcmurphy ?
no , his sergeant said he called in sick .
no sign of his car or him .
barney miller could have found something .
yeah , frost ?
okay , thanks .
another young woman got on a bus today .
she didn &apos;t make it home .
god . what can we do ?
artie &apos;s been a cop for a long time .
he knows we &apos;re looking for him .
he needs a safe place for his kill .
yeah , but we &apos;ve torn this house apart .
wait a minute .
he left his last victim in egleston square .
his wife &apos;s shop was in egleston square .
a lot of those old storefronts
have been vacant for a long time .
what better place to make your own doll , right ?

no , i said i won &apos;t .
i &apos;ll kill you .
please don &apos;t !
i swear i will .

will you tell ?
it &apos;s not artie . it &apos;s jonathan .
i won &apos;t .
jonathan .
jonathan .
put the gun down , artie .
jonathan , let her go .
doctors should have listened to me .
giving him day passes ,
trying to integrate him back into society .
that bus pass they gave him got two girls killed !
he &apos;s a monster .
mommy , tell . you have to tell .
no ! god !
i had to stop him . i had to do it .

what did -- what did he do to your mom ?
he hurt her .
where &apos;s your mom now ?
he said she went on the bus .
is -- is that why you &apos;ve been riding the bus ?
i just wanted to find her .
and then i did .
why didn &apos;t she tell ?
i just wanted her to tell what he did to her .
it &apos;s over . jonathan , it &apos;s -- i &apos;ll tell .

cadaver dog didn &apos;t find anything .
you knew we were coming to search your house .
come on , artie , we &apos;re taking you home .

he started a fire .
to throw off the dog .

okay .
you know , like , maybe we &apos;d meet once a week
for a run , you know ?
a run ?
yeah .
hell , i &apos;ll even take up rollerblading again .
payback is a bitch .
what ?
you were humiliated
when i said i didn &apos;t want to see you . i get it .
is it making you feel better to make me come here
and torture me ?
you want to ski , too ?
what are you talking about ?
i knew i was a fool when i got your note .
i was so happy .
wait . what note ? i didn &apos;t write you a note .
yeah ?
this is my mother &apos;s handwriting .
yeah .
maybe now you &apos;ll understand
why i didn &apos;t want to see you .
penetrating spinal @-@ cord injury .
just takes a dime @-@ sized piece of shrapnel
hitting you in the right place .
you happy now ?
casey , i had no idea .
now you do .
wait a minute . wait . i @-@ i didn &apos;t write this .
but if you would have told me ,
i would have said the same thing .
it doesn &apos;t matter .

okay .

just give me some time , okay ?
