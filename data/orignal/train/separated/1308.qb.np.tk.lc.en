female commissioned officers are addressed as &quot; ma &apos;am . &quot;
it &apos;s a sign of respect .
&quot; sir &quot; is a sign of respect .
&quot; ma &apos;am &quot; is for fat , old cat ladies .

good sons make good ...
good mechanics , ma ?
rizzoli .
looks like more than just a pump .
could take a while .
do you think i could get the friends @-@ and @-@ family discount ?
you got it , mrs . rizzoli . oh !
thank you !
oh , we have to leave .
um , i wish i could stay and help you pull the front cover .
let &apos;s go .
how ?
we don &apos;t have a car .
we &apos;ll take a taxi .
we are not going to the crime scene .
we are going home .
since you &apos;re a gearhead like me ,
take julietta .
restored her myself .
i would love that !
cool !
i would love that .
1975 was a great year .
no . stay away from giovanni .
&quot; no &quot; ?
oh , this is a dibs thing .
&quot; a dibs thing &quot; ? really ?
okay , tell me what you have in common with him .
all right , he &apos;s a blue @-@ collar ...
... boston @-@ italian auto mechanic .
well , so are you .
well , except for being an auto mechanic .
and we &apos;re best friends .
yes , but i &apos;m interesting .
and you don &apos;t want to sleep with me .
do you ?
no .
no ! but that &apos;s my point .
that &apos;s all i want to do with giovanni .
i just don &apos;t really think
you have the patience for giovanni &apos;s type .
well , what &apos;s his type ?
fun ... till he starts to talk .
sweet . where &apos;d you get that alfa ?
&quot; lookin &apos; hot . &quot;
what do we got ?
white female , badly beaten
badly beaten , possibly raped .
brenda martin , 21 years old ,
somerville address .
homeless guy looking for bottles found her .
initial external examination
indicates likely sexual assault .
navy issue .
she was wearing it . there &apos;s a blond hair inside .
navy ? we got thousands of sailors in town .
only time i envied sailors -- fleet week .
don &apos;t they have marine week ?
do now . didn &apos;t then . i was gypped .
that &apos;s a racial slur .
racial slur ?
against fortune @-@ tellers ?
actually , that &apos;s another racial slur .
that &apos;s odd .
what appears to be orange juice on her collar .
now look at her cheek .
face paint -- red , white , and blue .
probably an american flag .
dust along the handle and door ...
please don &apos;t tell me she came out of the dirty robber .
figures .
swabbies can &apos;t even leave us
one little corner during fleet week .
i &apos;ll stand by with the crime @-@ scene techs .
well , i &apos;m coming with you .
why ?
you are not the boss of me .
if i want to go out with giovanni ,
i will go out with him .
but right now , i @-@ i have to pee .
cute blond girl ?
there were a bunch of them here .
what about one with
an american flag painted on her cheek ?
i was too busy making fuzzy navels .
fuzzy navels ?
mm @-@ hmm .
peach schnapps , o.j. , lemonade
chick drink .
sell gallons of it with the navy boys in town .
o.j. on her collar .
well , try to remember .
she was 5 &apos; 2 , &quot; cute , blond , face paint ...
drinking fuzzy navels .
anything ring a bell , slick ?
well , now that you put it so nicely ,
there was one couple .
i remember him because he did
that famous sailor kiss with her .
the iconic image photographed
by alfred eisenstaedt on v @-@ j day .
yeah , that &apos;s the one .
didn &apos;t you have an emergency ?
yes , i did .
can you describe the guy for us ?
well , sure .
young , crew cut , wearing a white uniform .
that help you ?
not so much .
fractures to the ethmoid , lacrimal sac pneumatic pumps
cause of death ?
she was strangled .
rape kit .
positive for semen .
severe vaginal bruising and tearing .
so , she was raped .
i &apos;ll get this to the lab , have them run the profile
through codis and the department of defense dna registry .
that d.o.d. databank was intended
to identify soldiers &apos; remains ,
not to find sexual predators .
i &apos;d hate to think a navy man would do this .
i &apos;m gonna get a burger at that new place on boylston .
you want one ?
i &apos;ll just get a sandwich at the cafe .
i wouldn &apos;t . place is a disaster since stanley took over .
stanley from the post office ?
he &apos;s got a cousin in personnel .
yeah , i &apos; help pay to fix her car ,
but what are we gonna do about her ?
she &apos;s never worked a day in her life . i have no idea .
she took care of us .
okay , i &apos;m not saying that
we make her live in a refrigerator box .
i &apos;m just saying , you know , she needs to be busy .
she needs to do something
so she feels good about herself .
oh , she needs a job .
yeah .
out of bagels , out of toast .
we stop serving breakfast at 8 : 00 .
you could use some help telling time , stanley .
get in line .
you gonna stand there , or you gonna order something ?
nice customer service .
yeah ? thanks !
you could also use some help with the coffee .
may i suggest taking your dirty socks
out of the coffee pot ?
you don &apos;t like it , go someplace else , rizzoli .
you know ...
don &apos;t tick him off .
anthrax came through the postal service .
hey , you know the
fleet week killer you guys are working ?
who &apos;s calling him that ?
i want in .
you want in on my homicide ?
i need more experience before the detective &apos;s exam .
i @-@ i &apos;ll do grunt work , whatever you want .
vomit .
i hate carnations !
jane , there you are .
here i am .
i , uh -- hey , frankie .
hey , giovanni . how you doin &apos; ?
so , uh , i was wondering if --
i have a boyfriend . yes . i do .
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s very serious .
you do ?
if you could tell me where to find maura .
giovanni , come in .
uh , what are you doing here ?
how &apos;d you get stuck with all this old stuff ?
you look hot .
thank you .
for you .
oh , uh , i &apos;m the one that owes you
for letting me drive your alfa .
you can keep julietta as long as you like .
oh , no , i @-@ i couldn &apos;t .
actually , here you go .
thank you .
thank you . excuse me .
we &apos;re just in the middle of a new case .
oh , sure . i &apos;ll let you get back to it .
can you give my estimate to mrs. rizzoli ?
i @-@ i &apos;m just charging her for parts .
that &apos;s very nice of you .
i &apos;m not just being nice .
i want to take you out .
listen , you like italian ?
i love italians .
italian . northern italian . southern , too .
and the food .
let me take you to dinner .
oh , it would be faster if you come to my house .
faster ?
for me . for me .
because i work really long hours .
yeah . i love hot women who can cook .
okay .
oh , nice .
this guy .
god .
uh , sergeant korsak , there was a match
on the dna semen that we found in the victim .
i &apos;m afraid it is a sailor .
yes , ma &apos;am , i @-@ i met her at the bar ,
but i did not do that .
what did you do ?
we partied , but ...
you partied ? meaning what ?
we had sex , sir .
you just met her .
look , i know how this sounds , ma &apos;am ,
but i did not hurt her .
i liked her .
she was nice .
d.a. wants him held on an aggravated @-@ rape charge .
wait , but -- but i didn &apos;t do it .
loo--
my ship is gonna leave .
we cooperated with your questioning .
but if you think the navy &apos;s just gonna give you this sailor --
it &apos;s not up to the navy .
this is outside of military jurisdiction .
let &apos;s go , sailor .
detective frost
i have a navy admiral here to see you .
i got this , sergeant detective .
dad , what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m here if the immediate release
of petty officer salerno .
yeah , nice to see you , too .
and to inform you that your superiors
must exonerate the united states navy
from involvement in these unfortunate events .
you see this badge ?
it &apos;s a detective &apos;s badge .
but right now , this badge outranks your star .
don &apos;t make this personal , son .
it &apos;s not personal .
need i remind you ...
fleet week is a very lucrative endeavor .
it &apos;ll be a great loss to your city
if it were to be held elsewhere .
i &apos;m pretty sure we &apos;ll manage that loss , sir .
it &apos;s too bad we couldn &apos;t settle this like men .
are we the oldest people here ?
from the two gentlemen at the bar .
my hand hurts from waving .
what are they , 13 ? they both have acne .
i think the dark @-@ haired one has braces .
i &apos;ll use the next one to water the plants .
no , i don &apos;t like to be rude .
is that why you took giovanni &apos;s velveteen box of chocolates ?
what &apos;d he get you , a stuffed rabbit , too ?
he &apos;s sweet .
ugh !
umbrellas in drinks started in the 1930s .
anything polynesian was considered wildly exotic .
unlike giovanni -- wildly dull .
why would you say you &apos;d have dinner with him ?
because he has a spectacular torso ,
and he &apos;s giving your mom a great deal on her car repair .
oh . well , in that case ,
play with him all you like .
hey , jane . we got a second rape victim .
korsak says same m.o.
salerno &apos;s in lockup .
not anymore , he &apos;s not .
admiral frost bailed him out two hours ago .
admiral frost ?
you sure it &apos;s frost &apos;s father ?
yeah .
well , admiral frost ,
he got a lot of juice to get bail on a murder suspect .
this rape is on him .
janey .
what do we got ?
dog walker found her .
you all right ?
we got a sailor raping women .
frost , it &apos;s not your fault .
my father sprung him , jane .
it &apos;s on me .
come on .
pulse is weak and thready .
she &apos;s still alive .
paramedic went to pronounce her ,
found a pulse .
she was dumped here .
you find any personal belongings ?
nothing . swept the area .
look what he left behind .
piece of a blue surgical bootie , which mean ..
he was all about making sure
he didn &apos;t leave behind any footprints or dna .
second victim &apos;s the same m.o. --
white , petite , 20 @-@ something .
if it &apos;s salerno ,
he &apos;s a serial rapist and a murderer .
she &apos;s lucky to be alive .
near @-@ freezing temperature of the mud
reduced brain swelling , saved her life .
what kind of life , though ?
too soon to know .
thanks .
did you do a rape kit yet ?
yes .
injuries are consistent with a violent rape ,
but there &apos;s no evidence of semen .
so , this time , he wore a condom .
god , she looks bad .
the mri shows bleeding on her brain .
it &apos;s not looking good .
did you see this ?
what is that ?
looks like some kind of an abrasion on the skin
left by an impression .
impression of what ?
i &apos;d have to do comparison testing .
looks like a zipper , maura .
can you hear me ?
my name is detective jane rizzoli .
you &apos;re in the hospital . you &apos;re safe .
and we &apos;re gonna keep you safe ,
and we &apos;re gonna find who did this to you .
hey , sweetie .
what &apos;s your name ? can you tell me your name ?
it &apos;s dark .
shh , shh , shh , shh . it &apos;s okay . you &apos;re safe .
you &apos;re safe .
no . stop .
dolphins .
all the dolphins .
it &apos;s okay , baby . nobody &apos;s gonna hurt you here .
blue light .
i see blue .
blue light .
why ?
what do you think ?
i think it &apos;s a matter of time , jane .
we &apos;ve got to find salerno .
i don &apos;t want any more of these girls .
&quot; homey , i need a boner . &quot;
what ? !
spelling errata .
your mother really should proof @-@ read .
it &apos;s &quot; honey , i need a loaner . &quot;
where &apos;s her car , maura .
until giovanni fixes it , i &apos;m her own personal chauffeur .
well , he &apos;s doing it at cost , jane .
he &apos;s doing it to get laid , maura .
oh . okay , it &apos;ll be ready tomorrow .
hey , ladies , you want one ?
no , thanks , man .
it &apos;s dragon fire ! free samples . they &apos;re great .
rizzoli .
thank you .
don &apos;t be rude .
we found petty officer salerno .
oh , that &apos;s great , frost .
not really .
he has an alibi for the second victim .
how solid ?
rock @-@ solid .
at least my father had that part right .
salerno was on the ship , locked up in the brig .
so , this predator is still out there .
i &apos;m having bric track every port these ships have been to ,
cross @-@ reference with ncic .
good idea .
see if there are any reports of any similar rape @-@ murders
where the ships have docked .
let me know if you get a hit , okay ?
okay , on it .
all right , bye .
why didn &apos;t frost tell me about his father ?
we &apos;re partners .
well , do you tell him everything ?
no . well , yeah .
the big stuff . i mean , we &apos;re friends .
well , you and frost are site @-@ specific friends .
okay , so , would we be friends
if we didn &apos;t work together ?
we would never see each other if we didn &apos;t work together .
so , that &apos;s a &quot; no . &quot;
well , that &apos;s a flawed syllogism .
you know , like &quot; all rabbits have whiskers .
rabbits are mammals .
so all mammals have whiskers . &quot;
get it ?
never mind .
it &apos;s gonna rain .
oh , what , now you &apos;re the weather lady .
no , look at the beacon , okay ?
steady red , rain ahead . steady blue , clear view .
that beacon is highly inaccurate .
no .
clear view . it &apos;s blue .
blue light .
that &apos;s why she said that .
she could see the light from where she was being attacked .
maura , what is that ?
that &apos;s -- it &apos;s not a residential neighborhood .
that &apos;s , uh -- that &apos;s hotels , right ?
she mentioned a dolphin .
there &apos;s no dolphin hotel .
maybe it &apos;s -- it &apos;s in a painting or on a menu or something .
not a menu .
most cultures don &apos;t eat dolphin .
although inuits hunt orcas ,
which is a type of dolphin .
i &apos;m not suggesting we &apos;re looking for a place that serves flipper .
i &apos;m saying maybe there &apos;s a dolphin in the logo .
yeah . that &apos;s it , jane . look .
sea harbor hotel has a dolphin .
i &apos;ll get korsak .
you can see the beacon from this floor on up .
this side of the building only ?
yes .
any women registered on the floor ?
three , all single occupants .
are you sure your victim was one of our guests ?
well , if she was , we &apos;ll know when we see her room .
was this room cleaned this morning ?
we don &apos;t send housekeeping in
when there &apos;s a request for privacy .
would you open the door , please ?
yeah .
she was probably raped here .
he &apos;s careful , though .
i bet we don &apos;t find much forensic evidence .
bet we don &apos;t find anything .
probably lying in wait ,
attacked her , pinned her to the bed , raped her .
wearing gloves , booties , and a condom .
got a name .
kim tretorn , 24 .
sales rep for a software company in minneapolis .
welcome to boston .
i &apos;ll call the crime @-@ scene response unit
and get them in here .
kim tretorn . she was in town to meet with vendors .
she had dinner with one at the hotel at 7 : 00 .
yeah . here she is going back to her room alone at 8 : 04 .
they got cameras in the lobby , all the elevators ,
and the emergency exits , but not in the hallways .
okay , so she gets on the elevator .
nobody follows her in there .
and we have her here a minute later
getting off on her floor .
i &apos;ve been through every bit of this security tape --
stairs , elevator , lobby .
she doesn &apos;t leave the hotel .
well , she got out of the building somehow ,
because our dog walker found her three hours later
almost beaten to death .
i &apos;m telling you , she didn &apos;t leave .
her room faces stanhope street .
someone would &apos;ve noticed
if she rappelled down from the 36th floor .
it &apos;s the hospital .
detective jane rizzoli .
okay , thank you .
our second victim , kim , just died .
i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t have time to cook .
uh , mussels posillipo ,
beef carpaccio with a black @-@ truffle oil ,
and fettuccine alla grappa with organic baby tomatoes .
you don &apos;t like this ?
i don &apos;t like little tomatoes .
we can pick them off .
my ma makes the best plain spaghetti with butter .
let &apos;s have a glass of wine instead .
you got any beer ?
yes .
here you go .
let &apos;s get comfortable .
hey , you see the new shortstop hit for the cycle ?
i didn &apos;t . no .
i was noticing your necklace .
yeah . wards off the friggin &apos; malochia .
oh . uh , the evil eye . of course .
i &apos;ll get you one .
thank you . it &apos;s , um ...
no , thank you .
okay . you look hot .
smell hot , too .
thank you .
i love talking to you .
i could talk to you all night .
but right now , babe , all i want to do ...
is get you naked and lick your face .
lick my face ?
come to daddy .
what &apos;s the matter ?
i &apos;m sorry .
i -- i feel a little nauseated .
whoa ! don &apos;t barf on me . this is a new shirt .
oh . hey , hey , i &apos;m sorry . go -- go ahead .
i bet even your -- even your barf &apos;s cute , too .
go through it again .
jane .
the victim enters here ,
gets on the elevator here .
and we watch the elevator lights again .
hey , doc , you &apos;re working late .
hey . giovanni notice anything other than your cleavage ?
uh , jane , he wanted to lick my face .
i &apos;m so surprised .
you mean he didn &apos;t take you to see the boston pops
and then for a four @-@ course prix fixe at l &apos;espalier ?
no . no , he likes plain spaghetti .
i just wanted to sleep with him . if only he didn &apos;t talk .
or have a face @-@ licking fetish ?
he keeps texting and leaving messages .
he put my picture up on his facebook page .
how do i get rid of him ?
tell him the truth .
i can &apos;t .
he &apos;s -- he &apos;s sweet .
well , then go have little giovannis with him .
just make sure you can genetically alter them
so they don &apos;t lick ...
or talk .
mmm . smells great .
boy , my blood sugar &apos;s plummeting .
well , help yourself .
you find anything ?
no .
there &apos;s nothing on these tapes .
let &apos;s look at the lobby again .
wait . go back .
who is this guy ?
does the navy stay at the hotels ?
no , sailors all sleep on their ships .
same with the officers .
so , who &apos;s this guy with the suitcase ?
he &apos;s an officer .
he keeps turning his head .
it &apos;s like he knows where the cameras are .
frost , push in on the suitcase .
look at the wheels .
he &apos;s having trouble getting it over the metal door jamb .
because he &apos;s pulling a heavy load .
yeah , 107 pounds of kim tretorn .
so he rapes her , he beats her unconscious ,
and then he gets her out stuffed in that suitcase .
one hell of a ballsy move .
maura , that mark on her face --
would that match the zipper from the suitcase ?
those marks are consistent with that type of a zipper .
that &apos;s as good as finding the murder weapon .
we find that suitcase ,
we can match the zipper impression
to the one on her face .
jane , look at this .
he tips his hat to the maid , cool as a cucumber .
he &apos;s had a lot of practice .
we are looking for a naval officer
that &apos;s a serial rapist and a murderer .
it &apos;s gonna be a long night .
just got this from ncic .
three hits -- similar rape @-@ murders ,
all in the last year .
same m.o.
- 20s , petite .
look at the locations .
new orleans , indianapolis , houston .
ships don &apos;t go to indianapolis or houston .
murders aren &apos;t connected .
unless he &apos;s not our guy .
we haven &apos;t had a rape @-@ murder all year ,
then two in a row while thousands of sailors are in town ?
it &apos;s a sailor .
i &apos;ve been staring at him all night .
take a break , frost .
can &apos;t . we got to get him .
got less than a day before those ships sail .
your father -- you knew he was here .
the ship &apos;s here , he &apos;s here .
and you weren &apos;t gonna see him ?
hey , he knew how to find me when he needed something .
he gave me one like this ...
the day we moved to japan .
dragged me and my mom all the way out there ,
then took a commission on a ship .
two years went by
before she gave up , came back to boston .
i &apos;m sorry .
you know , seemed to me he was here to see you .
he could have just asked me to spring salerno .
he wasn &apos;t asking . he was ordering .
he came here to do what he always does --
serve the navy .
but turns out he wasn &apos;t wrong , frost .
salerno was not our guy .
you know what , korsak ?
why don &apos;t you spend your time working on this case
instead of defending somebody that you don &apos;t even know ?
hey , i &apos;m sorry .
i got work to do .
i shouldn &apos;t have stuck my nose in .
probably not , no . just --
just give him some time .
god , i want to get this bastard , korsak .
hello , stanley .
try the coffee . made it special for you .
really ?
yeah . put my underwear in it today .
morning , sweetheart . sergeant .
isn &apos;t it a lovely day ?
what are you doing here , ma ?
i &apos;m going to work .
i &apos;ve got that car @-@ repair bill to pay .
you &apos;re late , rizzoli , on your first day .
i &apos;m really sorry , mr. stanley . it &apos;ll never happen again .
i was having some car trouble and --
yes , look , save it for someone who cares .
here . hair net .
oh , my god . i &apos;m gonna arrest him for a health @-@ code felony .
ma , you can &apos;t work for mr. stanley .
hey , lady .
what &apos;s your problem ?
my problem is you . there &apos;s a line here .
i see that . try the coffee .
what are you doing ?
don &apos;t cut the line , ma &apos;am .
did you just call me &quot; ma &apos;am &quot; ?
you gonna yammer or help my customers ?
yeah !
i &apos;m so sorry .
what can i do for you ?
i would like to pay for this .
there you are . i need your help .
well , i like your bear .
did giovanni win that for you at the carnival ?
it &apos;s not funny .
okay , he seems to be under some impression
that we are in a relationship .
well , tell him that you were only interested in sleeping with him .
and then you became uninterested
when he tried to be a person and have a conversation .
he says he &apos;s waiting on special parts for your mother &apos;s car .
okay .
yeah . what if he means my parts ?
i don &apos;t think this is police business .
oh , gosh .
all right , look ,
the next time i tell you don &apos;t , don &apos;t , okay ?
go do the second autopsy . i have an idea .
really ?
yeah .
oh , thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
thank you . thank you .
it &apos;s a small fiber -- synthetic .
nylon , you think ?
could be .
from the suspect &apos;s roller bag , maybe .
i &apos;ll take it to fiber analysis .
giovanni .
you look hot .
hey , i left you a bunch of messages .
you , uh -- did you get the bear ?
isn &apos;t it interesting what dr. isles does for a living ?
she dissects dead bodies .
believe me , all right ?
this -- this part you don &apos;t want to see .
