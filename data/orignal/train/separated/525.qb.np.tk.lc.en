entropy
you &apos;re part of an interconnected group of hitmen working together online .
how many of them are you ?
besides me , quatro .
the last time we talked ,
you hinted that this was your next target--
the dirty dozen . who are they ?
you &apos;re the dirty dozen ?
but if they &apos;re as good as i think they are ,
no one can stop them .
director cochran , do you mind if we borrow your pen ?
something tells me the access codes
to the darknet servers are in there .
i &apos;m scared . what &apos;s going on ?
there &apos;s been a major break in the case
of the hitmen hunting you .
there has ?
and we may have found a way
to bring the whole network down .
hi . table for two for spencer .
here you are .
thank you so much .
you &apos;re welcome .
spencer ?
cat ?
hi !
hi .
hi .
hello . hi .
nice to finally--
oh--sorry , i have a-- a germ thing .
i &apos;m kind of weird with hu @-@ hugs .
sorry .
can i sit down ?
yes , please . oh , yeah . of course .
sit down .
first time doing this ?
yeah . i mean , yeah .
yeah , i--i still get nervous , too .
really , it wasn &apos;t until an hour ago that i was like ,
wait , we &apos;ve been trading emails back and forth ,
but i still have no idea what this guy looks like .
hence the ...
i know . and then i was like , wait ,
he &apos;s going to bring a red rose ,
so we need to go to a nicer place ,
which is why i switched the restaurant last @-@ minute--
not a problem at all .
and now i need to change and put something nice on
for this place , &apos; cause i was totally underdressed ,
and my whole wardrobe makes me look like a kardashian .
you don &apos;t know who that is , do you ?
no , oh , yeah , robert kardashian .
he got o.j. simpson off .
you--you don &apos;t look like his daughters .
yeah , no , i was making a joke about them .
no , it was good . it was a good joke .
no , it wasn &apos;t .
it was funny .
can we start over ? hi , i &apos;m cat .
hi--hi , i &apos;m -- i &apos;m spencer .
it really is nice to meet you ,
in person , finally .
it &apos;s nice to meet you .
tell me a little bit about yourself .
do you really have 3 ph.ds ?
yes . um , i--yeah , i do , i have 3 i have 3 ph.ds.
what was your favorite book that you read last year ?
um , honestly , i &apos;ve never read a book i didn &apos;t love .
tell me about your wife .
if you don &apos;t mind , i &apos;d , uh ,
i &apos;d rather not talk about her .
might as well get it out in the open , right ?
that &apos;s why we &apos;re here .
how long have you been married ?
4 years .
when is she due to give birth ?
a couple of--
a couple of months .
should we talk about price now , or ...
slow down , tiger . what exactly are we negotiating here ?
you know .
i want to hear you say it .
to have her killed .
let me see your ring .
you know what that is ?
a noose .
only it doesn &apos;t kill you all at once .
it kills you slowly ,
day by day .
you ever feel that way ?
i feel that way all the time .
take it off .
why ?
as a sign of your commitment .
to me .
if she sticks to pattern ,
she &apos;ll take him to a secondary location and kill him .
we &apos;re not gonna let it get that far .
hotch , do you have a visual ?
just hacked in .
all right , we have you over her left shoulder .
do you copy ?
all right , all agents stand by .
dr. reid will give the green light .
don &apos;t move until we have it .
24 @-@ karat ?
24k times ... 4 years
means this ring should be dinged and nicked .
but the sucker is brand @-@ new .
you &apos;re not married .
what was that ? was that what i think it was ?
everybody hold .
why are we here , spencer ?
we &apos;re here because you belong to a network of 4 hitmen
who &apos;ve been operating in the shadows of the internet .
you &apos;re know as miss 45 .
my team and i have been hunting for months ,
and i knew that if i boxed you in ,
i could arrest you with as little resistance as possible .
your team being the behavioral analysis unit of the fbi ?
you guys are good . you &apos;re the only ones that got close to us .
but we got kind of close to you , too , didn &apos;t we ?
hi , penelope .
do you know why i &apos;m so good at my job ?
because you kill without compunction or remorse .
that only gets a girl so far in life .
no , it &apos;s because i think through every potential outcome
and then i plan accordingly .
you see , i didn &apos;t walk into your trap .
you walked into mine .
where &apos;s your head , spencer ?
what are you thinking about ?
i was thinking about entropy .
it &apos;s the thermodynamic measure of the degradation
of matter and energy in the universe .
to put it another way--
there &apos;s your gun .
good evening .
hi , uh , you know what ?
we &apos;ve been having so much fun getting to know one another ,
we &apos;ll let you know when we &apos;re ready , ok ? thank you .
now that we got that out of the way ,
will you do me a favor and tell blondie mcblonderson
over there at the bar to disappear .
jj , stand down .
thanks for playing , sweetie .
if she learns how many agents we have outside ,
she &apos;ll start shooting .
dave , get ready to take her out .
yeah .
reid , do not let her get up from the table .
all right , you &apos;re in charge .
tell me what you want and i &apos;ll see if i can get it here for you .
anything i want ?
anything you want .
like a million dollars in unmarked bills ,
maybe a plane to aruba ?
is that what you want ?
and you &apos;ll say you &apos;ll bring it here ,
but the real plan is to distract me
from what is , i &apos;m sure ,
an impressive law enforcement response
just outside that door . is that the plan ?
that &apos;s the plan .
ok , let &apos;s talk ,
but let &apos;s talk about something interesting , at least .
tell me about me .
you ?
you &apos;re a black widow hitwoman .
you specialize in seduction and you &apos;re patient .
you learn everything you can
about the men you &apos;re hired to kill ,
physically , psychologically , and emotionally ,
because you want them
in as compromised a position as possible
so they don &apos;t see it coming when you pull the trigger .
and when i do it really well ,
they pull the trigger themselves .
give me your phone .
why ?
because i know what i want now .
i want to play a game with you .
you like games ?
i do .
do you win ?
i always win .
give it to me .
ok , here &apos;s my game .
you have 30 minutes to answer every question i ask .
and if you lie , i &apos;ll know .
because i &apos;ve spent the past 10 years of my life
studying men and their lies
before i kill them .
do you believe me ?
i do .
that was true . you &apos;re getting this .
now , here &apos;s how we &apos;ll know who wins at the end of 30 minutes .
if you win , you &apos;ll drag me out of here in handcuffs .
but if i win , you will escort me out
like a gentleman ,
to make sure i exit safely .
what do you say , spencer ?
think you can win this one ?
considering everything you &apos;ve put garcia
and so many people through ,
you &apos;re going to have to shoot me in the face
before you walk out of here .
game on .
oh , boy .
what do you want to ask me ?
how you found me , of course .
a professional learns from her mistakes .
we got our big break in the case at the end of last year .
i didn &apos;t learn how big until i came back from some time off .
why &apos;d you take time off ?
higher , mommy , higher !
careful , sweetheart .
higher , mommy , higher !
hey , you !
hi .
welcome back . come in .
thank you .
i know you &apos;re not a hugger . i don &apos;t care .
hey , get your greasy hands off my girl .
nice to have you home , kid .
good to be back .
let me get my stuff .
that thing you called about , here &apos;s some updated stats .
thanks .
stats ?
stats from what ?
medical research . shop talk .
things you wouldn &apos;t be interested in .
well , i can tell you what i am interested in ,
and that is you .
you gonna love me forever ?
yes , i am .
forever ever ?
for ever , ever , ever .
guys . garcia and hotch need us asap
for a briefing on the 4 hitmen .
stop .
what ?
you didn &apos;t tell me why you took time off .
it &apos;s not relevant .
that &apos;s not the game .
the game is you answer every question i ask .
is it a secret ?
no .
is it dirty ?
no .
then tell me .
it &apos;s not important to your story .
out of curiosity , is it me you don &apos;t want to tell
or the people listening in ?
is this really how you want to spend your 30 minutes ?
yes .
no .
ok , so you were saying
you showed up for work that morning and ...
we learned that someone unexpected decided to talk .
and who would that be ?
brian cochran from the nsa .
i &apos;ve placed him on 24 / 7 lockdown at usp terre haute .
the network has proven
that they can kill anyone , anywhere , anytime ,
and now that they &apos;ve targeted garcia ,
we can &apos;t afford to lose another lead .
cochran used one of the hitmen to target dea supervisor graff .
but we can press him on that to get him to cooperate .
well , fortunately that won &apos;t be necessary .
he had a breakdown in solitary confinement
and he was already willing to make a deal .
we need to go talk to him .
garcia and i already did .
this is , we video @-@ conferenced with him .
he was limited in what he could tell us about the hit people .
he didn &apos;t know their names ,
but he did know all of their areas of expertise .
how specific do they get ?
most successful hitmen are basically
just swiss army knives of murder .
well , take the o.g. hit guy who got us into this mess ,
giuseppe montolo . remember him ?
he was a genius at making hits look like an accident .
the others , depends what you &apos;re looking for .
take the guy that &apos;s still out there
who &apos;s responsible for shooting poor mr. graff .
he &apos;s known simply as the sniper .
he can make a t @-@ zone shot from over 2,000 meters .
which means he &apos;s ex @-@ military .
not necessarily ours , but he &apos;s definitely trained .
so who &apos;s number two ?
that would be the chemist .
he works with poison .
he specializes in hits that don &apos;t leave a trace .
he sounds delightful .
what about number 3 ?
well , that would be the bomber .
according to cochran , he &apos;s responsible for this .
it &apos;s a chemical fire in tianjin , china .
apparently a bureaucrat didn &apos;t pay his bribe on time .
you know that &apos;s conspiracy theory garbage .
but what is credible is cochran &apos;s insistence
that he was trained by mossad .
jack garrett &apos;s following up on leads .
that leaves us with number 4,
the one with the highest body count of them all .
and who &apos;s that ?
me .
yes .
wow , that was really impressive .
yeah , the way you just made all those brilliant deductions
with all that information
that was just handed to you on a silver platter .
quick question--are you guys really profilers
or are you just lucky ?
because this , what i &apos;m about to say--
is profiling .
the reason you took time off from work
was to deal with the same girl who broke your heart .
no .
the death of a parent , then .
no .
ah , hello , i &apos;m getting close .
it &apos;s mom or dad in the billiard room with the candlestick .
oh , you &apos;re mad at me , aren &apos;t you ?
not even a little bit .
yes , you are , i can tell .
no offense , but you &apos;re not really worth getting angry at .
so you figured out what the 4 of us did , and then what ?
we profiled that you operated as spokes on a wheel .
somehow it had to be centralized ,
how you got jobs , who paid you .
somebody did all that for you .
you found the snowman , didn &apos;t you ?
great . so who &apos;s this snowman jagoff ?
cochran says he &apos;s the i.t. expert .
he &apos;s the key to the whole network .
but if he set it up ,
he &apos;s not just gonna tear it down because we ask nicely .
he will because he was kidnapped by one of the hitmen
and held against his will in a safe house .
i wonder how that feels .
even if they have him under duress ,
he &apos;s still gonna be impossible to find .
we will find him ...
with this .
whoa , whoa , whoa , i &apos;m confused . what just happened there ?
when we arrested cochran , we found a flash drive ,
one that gave us access to a specific shadow of the darknet ,
one we didn &apos;t even know existed .
oh , put a ring on it before you decide to do that .
oh , that &apos;s flashy . it &apos;s certainly cocky .
yeah , it &apos;s smart , but it &apos;s risky .
he &apos;s taking security flaws from his own code
and then exploiting them as another level of security .
if i didn &apos;t know any better , i &apos;d think he was having fun .
he wouldn &apos;t do this if his life depended on it , unless ...
he &apos;s young .
yeah , and based on this , like high school young .
garcia used it to find the website
that snowman set up for all of you .
once we had the website , we had geography ,
specifically , the safe house you were keeping him in .
so we waited until the shift change
when we knew we could take two of you down at once .
fbi ! everybody down !
fbi !
don &apos;t !
it &apos;s ok . we got you .
what is this ? what &apos;s going on ?
welcome to the fbi , kid .
well , well , well , you took the chemist and the sniper
out of commission , huh ?
did you know ?
i knew something was off .
they didn &apos;t bid on some contracts .
and this isn &apos;t the kind of job
where you get to take time off to be with your ...
mother ?
is it your mom ? it &apos;s gotta be your mom .
why &apos;d you take time off from the fbi ?
i &apos;m not gonna tell you .
spencer , why did you take time off
from the fbi ?
you can ask me as many times as you want ,
and you can continue to waste your time ,
but i &apos;m still not gonna tell you .
then you &apos;re cheating , and i don &apos;t like cheaters .
you don &apos;t get everything you want just because
you &apos;re pointing a gun at me under a table .
you &apos;re not the first killer to point a gun at me .
you &apos;re not even the first woman to point a gun at me .
sorry .
you &apos;re really gonna take this all the way , aren &apos;t you ?
yeah .
so am i.
dave , go .
look at my face . does it look like i &apos;m bluffing ?
i know you &apos;re not bluffing .
i &apos;m gonna ask you one more time .
before you say no , i want you to consider something .
she muffled the mike . we lost audio .
i &apos;ll kill the fed walking toward me first .
a stationary target &apos;s easier to hit .
after that it &apos;s a free @-@ fire zone .
fine , i &apos;ll tell you .
sorry , what was that ?
i &apos;ll tell you .
rossi , stand down .
please .
welcome to the locker room .
i hate the locker room .
my mom has schizophrenia ,
and the doctor has changed her medication ,
which seemed to agitate her ,
and so i went to the treatment center to help her .
that &apos;s it ?
that &apos;s it .
you just risked your life over mommy &apos;s pills ?
it &apos;s the truth .
it &apos;s part of the truth .
you &apos;re holding something back .
here &apos;s what i &apos;m gonna do .
i &apos;m gonna penalize you by adding 10 minutes .
and keep in mind that the only reason you &apos;re not dead right now
is because i did learn something important .
oh , really ? what &apos;s that ?
your backup . i flushed them out .
it &apos;s just you and me now .
guess again , bitch .
so when we left off , the score was you had two of our guys
and the snowman .
you must have thought you were home free .
no . if anything , the case was harder .
i can &apos;t tell you much about them .
it &apos;s not like we had a lot of heart @-@ to @-@ heart conversations
while they handcuffed me to a computer .
do you know any of their names ?
no . but i know their bank accounts .
how long do you think we have
before the other two realize the network &apos;s been compromised ?
two days , maybe .
they like being independent contractors ,
so they always work jobs separately .
and , uh , they rely on me to coordinate all their online traffic .
which i can help fake .
yeah .
we have the facade covered on our end ,
but they also have back channel communications
that i can &apos;t account for .
especially the bomber .
why him ?
i don &apos;t know .
all i know is when they would rotate watching over me ,
he never showed .
i know why . he &apos;s paranoid .
most explosive experts are .
blow everything up ,
you live in fear that you &apos;re next .
we need to lure out the hitwoman .
if we can take her alive , she &apos;ll lead us to the bomber .
we have to give her a target worth coming out of hiding for .
that means me , doesn &apos;t it ?
no .
sir .
garcia , that &apos;s not gonna happen .
it &apos;s too dangerous to leave you out there exposed like that .
you have a record of all the kills she was paid for ?
i have records of everything .
all right . even a contract killer can have a victimology ,
a pattern of which she &apos;s not aware .
we need to find that .
but first we had to get the data that we needed from the snowman .
from that we could start to
build the profile that would lead us to you .
when we knew what we were looking for , the pattern was obvious .
these 3 hits-- they were all men who wanted to kill their wives .
that &apos;s the oldest motivation in the book .
why are they special ?
she took their money , then killed the men who hired her .
all 3 of them had children .
maybe children are the line hitmen won &apos;t cross ?
the chemist and the sniper
both performed jobs that involved families .
theoretically , if the price is high enough ,
a hitman shouldn &apos;t have morals .
i think these kills are personal to her .
personal enough to risk double @-@ crossing her contract .
maybe something similar happened to her .
and that &apos;s how we get her to come to the table .
i pretend to be that kind of client .
how do we know that &apos;s gonna work ?
we don &apos;t . it &apos;s a calculated risk
based on her m.o. , which is categorically different than the men .
they &apos;re cold , clinical , long @-@ distance .
she &apos;s up close and personal .
she knows that she has to be more careful
because she actually wants to kill her targets .
i &apos;m going to pretend to be a husband
who wants his pregnant wife dead .
well , i &apos;d want to kill you if you told me that .
exactly . then all we have to do is set the right meeting spot .
a bar or a restaurant we control
so the odds are better of us taking her alive .
that &apos;s our best strategy .
but there is one flaw .
you . you &apos;re the flaw .
you &apos;re not married and you don &apos;t have children .
i &apos;m the person on my team who &apos;s the closest to your age ,
and i knew that if i lost control of the situation ,
you &apos;d be more likely to negotiate with a peer .
you have zero control here . none .
i outflanked you from the beginning .
some of your moves were pretty obvious .
such as ?
such as showing up armed .
such as changing the venue at the last moment .
i needed a restaurant full of innocents in case this was a trap .
if you really suspected this was a trap ,
then why show up at all ?
even when you first laid eyes on me ,
from the bar , from outside , from wherever you were ,
you should have seen through me
and kept on moving , but you didn &apos;t .
you couldn &apos;t .
because you can &apos;t get to the man
you really want to hurt ,
so you need to hurt any man who reminds you of him .
that &apos;s kind of boilerplate psychology , isn &apos;t it ?
i &apos;m just another girl with daddy issues .
you &apos;d be surprised how many killers
do what they do because of their parents .
if it &apos;s so boilerplate , why don &apos;t we test that theory ?
how hard did you look for him ?
very hard .
and how disappointed were you when you realized that
you will never find him ?
you needed some other outlet for your rage ,
and for a while this worked , but it also tripped you up .
can i tell you a little secret ?
everything eventually falls apart .
the trick is accepting when it &apos;s over .
except it ain &apos;t over , is it ?
do you really think i &apos;m just gonna let you walk out of here ?
you profiled so much about me ,
except you forgot to ask the most important question .
why would i make you sit here for 30 minutes ?
because you &apos;re stalling .
then you don &apos;t know me at all .
do you think i &apos;d show up here without an escape plan ?
or is that what just another girl with daddy issues do ?
maybe if you hadn &apos;t fallen victim to your own gender bias ,
and , yes , all men have gender bias ,
even you , dr. reid ,
you would have recognized that your entire strategy
was based on one faulty detail .
can you see it ?
they like being independent contractors ,
so they always worked jobs separately .
you &apos;re not here alone .
and my partner ? less paranoid than you think .
you planted a bomb in the building .
we &apos;re on the move .
i didn &apos;t . my job was to keep your entire team focused on us ,
so he could do what he does best .
hotch , we &apos;ve got interconnected c @-@ 4 charges down here .
how many ?
there &apos;s 6 charges . they &apos;re connected to the city &apos;s gas line .
she could take out the whole block .
there are innocent people here .
yes , there are .
so let me remind you what we &apos;re playing for .
not only will i walk out of here ,
but you will make sure i leave safely .
and from where i &apos;m sitting ...
it looks like i &apos;ve won .
you need to pay attention to this part .
i &apos;m going to tell you the terms of my victory .
i want you to move all of your backup away from this building .
if i walk out of here and i see one cop ,
i will incinerate us all .
i can &apos;t do that .
spencer .
it &apos;s not me . what you &apos;re asking takes time .
this is to whoever &apos;s in charge .
造成邪教内包括20名儿童与2名孕妇在内的76人死亡
unless you guys want to be responsible
fbi承受了巨大压力与声誉风险
for the biggest fbi disaster since waco ,
you will back off now .
watch this .
jj , say again . the bomb has a cell phone trigger ?
that &apos;s right . all she has to do is call the number and boom .
can you jam the signal ?
not from here , no .
the failsafe will still kick in .
same outcome-- can &apos;t move &apos; em , can &apos;t submerge &apos; em .
it &apos;ll take us hours to get the gas turned off on the whole block .
if we alert anyone ,
then the panic could set her and the bomb off .
swat &apos;s on the radio with the bomb squad .
they say our only chance is to get our hands on that cell phone .
if we shut down the trigger , we can remove the charges .
morgan .
go ahead , hotch .
does she have a cell phone with her ?
i don &apos;t think so . i didn &apos;t see her pull one out .
the bomber was setting this up while we were all up here .
i think he &apos;s holding the stick .
we &apos;re combing the block . he could be anywhere , though .
where &apos;s lewis ?
do not overreact .
do not rush .
simply give every patron their check
and tell them there &apos;s been an unforeseen problem in the kitchen
that cannot be resolved .
their dinner has been paid for
and they should leave calmly
and at their earliest possible convenience .
got it ?
yes , ma &apos;am .
great .
you . come with me .
that table there ,
you leave alone .
look at that . there they go .
all we want to do--
minimize the collateral damage . i get it .
i &apos;m not mad . it &apos;ll give me the cover i need to slip out .
i just need to know it &apos;s clear ,
so do me a favor and tell your boss
that nobody leaves until it &apos;s safe for me to .
reid , perimeter agents are pulling back .
you have to let her go .
well ?
repeat--all agents , do not engage or pursue
until the bomb is defused .
spencer ...
you can leave .
but you won &apos;t .
i &apos;m sorry ?
double or nothing . you need to sit back down .
reid , what are you doing ?
wow , now you &apos;re stalling .
you played your trump card , but i have one , too .
thanks for dinner .
i had fun .
i found your father .
no , you didn &apos;t .
look at my face . am i bluffing ?
i &apos;ll tell you where he is .
but you need to sit back down
and listen to the rest of my story .
no . tell me now .
or i &apos;ll--
detonate the bomb ?
you &apos;re not gonna do that , cat ,
because then you won &apos;t learn anything .
you said you were good at your job
because you think through every outcome .
well , guess what-- so do i.
all right .
finish the story .
to prepare for this dinner , i had to learn everything about you ,
starting with your real name .
foster care records locked , loaded , and searchable .
according to the emails she sent me setting up tonight ,
her name is cat . so let &apos;s assume her name is catherine .
give me more .
suspicious death for mom ,
and her dad most likely went away for manslaughter .
keep it coming .
rampant abuse .
she would have been in a world of pain .
sadly that does not rule out any catherines .
her first kills were most likely in the foster environment .
cross @-@ reference all those families
the catherines went into with accidental deaths
of foster dads , and focus on those
that have multiple abuse complaints leveled against them .
ding .
catherine adams .
daughter of daniel adams ,
who did in fact leave the country in 1987
but returned in 2012 .
based on confidential records in rehabs and sober living houses ,
which in turned pointed us to flophouses and soup kitchens .
he couldn &apos;t put 24 hours together sober .
and you can probably imagine my surprise
when i discovered that he actually
lives right here in d.c.
where ?
it &apos;s not that simple .
he was in bad shape when i found him .
is your name daniel adams ?
who wants to know ?
my name is spencer reid . i &apos;m with the fbi
and i &apos;d love to ask you a few questions .
leave me alone .
i &apos;m just trying to sleep .
mr. adams , i just need to ask you a few questions
about your daughter .
who ?
your daughter , catherine .
you don &apos;t recognize her , do you ?
i think you got the wrong man , pal .
he didn &apos;t remember me ?
the alcoholism shredded his brain .
i &apos;m sorry .
you &apos;re not sorry .
sorry is what people say when they don &apos;t understand .
wait .
your mother ... tell me .
is @-@ is this part of the game ?
no . the game &apos;s over .
when i looked at her medical chart ,
it @-@ it didn &apos;t make any sense .
the medication that they gave her
should have been helping ,
but i couldn &apos;t figure out what was making her so angry .
so , i , uh ,
i went to see her .
the moment i walked in her room ,
i saw it .
for 3 seconds ...
she didn &apos;t know who i was .
i , um , i had her tested that morning ,
and i found out that night ...
that she had early onset of dementia .
most likely alzheimer &apos;s .
did you test yourself ?
no , you didn &apos;t .
you were too scared .
did you know ?
no .
i thought i dodged a bullet when i turned 30
and didn &apos;t have a schizophrenic break like her ,
but , uh , this is somehow bigger and scarier
because i can actually see it happening .
all the memories that we used to share
are just dying .
i can &apos;t stop it .
i can &apos;t help her .
all i can do
is find people that i can help .
is that really why you showed up tonight ?
to help me ?
do you know how many men have told me
that they wanted to help me ?
how do you think that worked out for them ?
hotch , she just armed the bomb .
hotch , we need to pull back .
oh , my god , oh , my god , oh , my god .
morgan , get out of there .
hotch , we might have a lead here .
she hasn &apos;t touched anything to arm the bomb .
that means the bomber &apos;s here , somewhere in the restaurant .
all right , if you can take him ,
do so , but the priority is evacuation .
i &apos;m not even sure if it is a him .
cat mentioned something about gender bias ,
so that could apply to the bomber as well .
all right , she &apos;d have to be in a position to maintain
line of sight on reid all night . who do you see ?
look for anyone with their phone out .
that &apos;s the detonator .
our woman will give herself away by looking over .
you &apos;re right . you don &apos;t need my help .
you don &apos;t need anyone &apos;s help .
you are completely in control .
i &apos;ve got her .
blue dress . by the bar .
hey , you know what , baby ?
let &apos;s get out of here .
i &apos;m not really feeling this place .
really ? i kind of liked it .
i want to take you to a spot where we can do some dancing .
hotch , we &apos;re clear .
reid &apos;s not .
don &apos;t !
fbi . everybody stay calm , please .
we &apos;re gonna be smart about this
and talk it out .
aren &apos;t we , cat ?
that &apos;s up to you .
get everyone out of here .
move .
morgan , you , too .
i &apos;m not going anywhere .
guess we &apos;re right back where we started .
you and me with a gun .
reid , it &apos;s time .
no .
we don &apos;t have a choice . we have to do it .
do what ?
morgan , shut up .
there &apos;s one thing he hasn &apos;t told you yet .
that &apos;s not true . he &apos;s lying . don &apos;t listen to him .
what haven &apos;t you told me ?
nothing . i told you ... nothing !
what don &apos;t i know ?
nothing !
we brought your father here .
here ?
he &apos;s here ?
he &apos;s right outside .
reid thought he needed
every bargaining chip he could get .
morgan , i &apos;m begging you , don &apos;t . don &apos;t .
every bargaining chip he could get to convince you
to do the right thing .
how is this the right thing ?
your father killed your mother .
and there &apos;s no statute of limitations on murder ,
so you really need to think about your options right now .
you shoot him , i will kill you .
or if you surrender , you will live
to testify against your father .
that &apos;s not good enough .
we can arrange it for the two of you
to drive into custody together ,
and then you can remind him of who you are .
if you give her this , she wins . don &apos;t do it .
kid , i am trying to save your life .
now let me do that .
they &apos;re bringing him in right now .
you &apos;re really upset about this , aren &apos;t you ?
this is what you wanted , isn &apos;t it ,
a chance to finally hurt the man who deserves it ?
they all deserve it .
he deserves it the most .
only if spencer escorts me out .
deal .
hotch ?
yeah .
we &apos;re coming out .
ok , you &apos;re all clear .
you want to go home ?
wait .
ok , i &apos;m ready .
you lied to me .
if it makes you feel any better , i really-- i did look for him .
but ... i couldn &apos;t find him , so , yeah ,
i did make it all up .
not all of it .
you don &apos;t pull a story about a parent
losing her memory out of nowhere .
your mother and the alzheimer &apos;s , that &apos;s true .
i won .
how so ?
because i will get out of here .
yeah , in 20 years , maybe , if you &apos;re lucky .
yeah , that &apos;s fine . you know why ?
because in 20 years ...
i &apos;ll remember your name ,
but you won &apos;t remember mine .
you want to come in ,
decompress a bit ?
i &apos;m good . i &apos;m probably just gonna go home .
that was an intense case .
yeah .
it &apos;s over .
network &apos;s gone .
yeah .
reid .
that medical research that savannah gave you ,
was that ...
yeah .
you are gonna get yourself tested , aren &apos;t you ?
one of the data points that her research told me about was age .
i &apos;m , uh , too young to display the chromosomal signs ,
so i &apos;m just gonna have to ...
learn to live not knowing .
oh , my god .
what is happening right now ?
you &apos;re what &apos;s going on . right now is what &apos;s--
you are here . do you know what &apos;s happening right now ?
it is ... it is done . the dirty dozen is done .
yes , done . i &apos;m in it !
it &apos;s ...
how much did she have ?
she started out with jaeger .
jaeger ?
i love you .
ok .
i love you .
and you-- i love you so much .
and you , i should be jealous of you
because you &apos;re so hot . but i &apos;m not .
i &apos;m not . i promise you i &apos;m not . i &apos;m not . i promise .
no , i &apos;m not . &apos; cause you know what ?
all i feel in here is love . i just--
i am feeling-- i &apos;m full of love .
so much love . i &apos;m wearing too many clothes .
uh , i got this .
you sure you don &apos;t want to reconsider ?
i think i &apos;m ok . i &apos;m just gonna--
i really just want to go home .
hey , kid .
can i tell you something ?
yeah .
i just , uh ...
yeah .
you know ?
i know .
i know .
good .
because i mean it .
i &apos;ll see you tomorrow .
&quot; just as the constant increase of entropy
&quot; is the basic law of the universe ,
&quot; so it is the basic law of life
to struggle against entropy . &quot;
