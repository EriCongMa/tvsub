have you ever turned on a tv ?
it &apos;s my mother &apos;s birthday .
and you only turn 80 once .
or , in the case of most people , no times .
now , put your good clothes on .
i &apos;m already in a dress and pearls , and i &apos;m eight years old .
can &apos;t we go to her 81st birthday ?
that &apos;s the big one .
why does visiting my family always have to be so hard ?
because , face it , marge , your family doesn &apos;t like me .
never did , not even when i had hair and a future
and a bitchin &apos; pontiac gto .
where is that car , homer ?
i went to a music festival ,
and i couldn &apos;t remember where i parked it .
homie , i feel about my family like you felt about that car .
no one loves a person that much .
please go , for me ?
all right , but remember the signal .
if i tug my ear , it &apos;s time for us to leave .
i &apos;m switching to my left ear
because of what happened last time .
no you don &apos;t .
your grandmother knit this for you ,
so act like you wear it all the time .
she has a juice box .
why can &apos;t i have a juice box ?
because when she sticks in the straw ,
she doesn &apos;t slip and hit an artery .
oh , i &apos;ll never have juice .
* happy birthday to you *
* happy birthday , dear *
* mom *
* grandma *
* all of the above *
* happy birthday to you . *
thank you .
jacqueline , i took the money i usually give
to con artists and preachers and bought you these flowers .
nothing tops a simple romantic gesture .
except a rich man flaunting his wealth .
the one thing i can &apos;t beat-- competition .
oh , jacqueline , i fell in love with you
the moment i came down with dementia .
so to win your heart , i got you an old @-@ fashioned music player .
mr. yo @-@ yo ma .
no one said there &apos;d be music .
there &apos;s always room for cello .
i know when i &apos;m licked , burns .
she &apos;s yours .
um , not interested .
i just don &apos;t want you to have her .
that &apos;s the meanest thing i ever heard ,
and i used to practice cello on the subway .
i &apos;m next !
hey , you two , quit having fun .
trust me , nothing i &apos;ve done today has been fun .
hey , hey , the plastic &apos;s here for a reason--
to keep the couch clean .

voila , now i take a simple napkin and ...
who &apos;s ready to see some slides of us as teenagers ?
here are the slides .
oh , just one box .
five terabytes .
that &apos;s over 50,000 caro usels of family fun .
here &apos;s us walking up the steps
of teotihuacan &apos;s pyramid of the sun .
walking , walking , stopping , walking .
walking , walking , walking .
stopping , stopping .

how did grampa bouvier die ?
no one &apos;s ever told us .
you know what , i actually don &apos;t know .
me neither . not a clue .
girls , i &apos;m afraid i didn &apos;t tell any of you for a reason .
the real story ,
and it was something people were ashamed to say at the time ,
is that he died of lung cancer .
mom , how could you know that and still let us smoke ?
i thought it made you look cool .
hey , lis , do you think i can climb walls like spider @-@ man
with denture cream on my hands ?
nope .
next time , you should wait for my answer .
knock it off , your grandmother &apos;s bathroom is not a toy chest .
vicodin .
i think it &apos;s time , selma dear .
time we quit smoking .
well , anyway , happy birthday .
man , i can &apos;t believe your sisters stopped smoking .
i just hope they don &apos;t put on weight .
you &apos;re so fat !
you &apos;re even fatter .
damn straight .
no one out @-@ fats me .
time for beddy @-@ bye .
now , don &apos;t sleep on your stomach .
or is it your back ?
can never remember .
whichever is the comfortable one , don &apos;t do that .
say hello to fun .
oh , yeah !
oh , no !

under &quot; eyes , &quot; i put &quot; red and dilated . &quot;
ooh , thank you , sir .
selma , not smoking hasn &apos;t affected you at all .
how is that possible ?
i even smell cigarette smoke when it &apos;s not around .
like right now .
maybe you &apos;re having a stroke .
phantom smells are a symptom .
eh , what &apos;s the penalty for driving a tractor drunk
through a renaissance faire ?
can &apos;t help you-- i might be having a stroke .
i have to consult a competent medical professional .
