what is it about me ? do i not look fun enough ?
is there something repellent about me ?
how was the party ?
it couldn &apos;t have been worse . a woman literally passed through me .
what is it ? am i hideously unattractive ?
no , you are not . you are very attractive .
i go through the same thing .
when i put on a little weight , i question everything .
i &apos;ve put on weight ?
did you want to ... ?
no , not weight . more like insulation .
i &apos;m unemployed , in dire need of a project .
wanna work out ? i can remake you .
i would , but that might get in the way of my lying @-@ around time .
please ?
come on , let her do it !
all right .
if we put on spandex and my boobs are bigger than yours , i &apos;m going home .
your boobs are fine .
i shouldn &apos;t have said anything .
come here . come here !
can &apos;t make hands meet !
let &apos;s do it !
what ?
nothing . just never seen your little stretchy pants before .
it &apos;s cute .
and we &apos;re changing .
come on , give me five more !
five more !
five more and i &apos;ll flash you .
one ...
... two ...
... two and a half .
just show me one of them .
she &apos;s insane !
the woman is insane .
it &apos;s before work , after work , and during work .
she &apos;s got me doing butt @-@ clenches at my desk .
and now they won &apos;t bring me my mail anymore .
tell her to stop .
no , while she &apos;s unemployed i &apos;m all she &apos;s got .
why don &apos;t we all pitch in and buy her a restaurant ?
hey , pheebs . how &apos;d it go with scott ?
it was nice . took him to a romantic restaurant ...
... ordered champagne . nice .
he still won &apos;t put out ?
nope . zilch . nothing .
sorry , pheebs .
look , i don &apos;t mind taking it slow .
i like him a lot .
he &apos;s really interesting , and he &apos;s really sweet .
why won &apos;t he give it up ?
maybe he drives his car on the other side of the road .
if you know what i mean .
no . what do you mean ? he &apos;s not british .
maybe he &apos;s gay .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s the problem .
we went dancing the other night ...
... and just the way he held me so close and looked into my eyes ....
i just definitely felt something .
but how much can you tell from a look ?
i felt it on my hip . i could tell .
yo , bing ! racquetball in 20 minutes .
joey , be a pal . lift up my hand and smack her with it .
oh , rachel ! don &apos;t look .
what ?
i don &apos;t care . i have a date tonight .
you have a date ?
monica &apos;s setting me up .
what about ross and ....
what ? my whole insane jealousy thing ?
well , you know , as much fun as that was ...
... i &apos;ve decided to opt for sanity .
you &apos;re okay about all this ?
oh , yeah , come on ! i &apos;m moving on .
he can press her up against that window as much as he wants .
for all i care , he can throw her through the damn thing .
hi , guys .
monica , i &apos;ll come by tomorrow and pick up fluffy &apos;s old cat toys , okay ?
if you say his full name .
can i come over tomorrow and pick up fluffy meowington &apos;s cat toys ?

actually , we &apos;re getting a cat .
together ?
both of you ? together ?
it &apos;ll live with ross half the time and with me half the time .
well , isn &apos;t that just lovely ?
that &apos;s something you &apos;ll enjoy ...
... for a really , really , really long time .
hopefully .
look at that . i gotta go ! i got a date !
with a man .

we &apos;re not supposed to take these when we leave .
i don &apos;t know if monica told you , but this my first date since my divorce .
if i seem a little nervous ...
... i am .
how long do cats live ?
i &apos;m sorry ?
cats . how long do they live ?
figuring you don &apos;t throw them under a bus or something ?
maybe 1.5,1.6 years .
well , that &apos;s just great .
cheers !

you know ?

i mean , i &apos;ve you know , i &apos;ve got a cab .

cat !
hey , joey .
hey , pheebs .
how come you &apos;re watching a rabbi play electric guitar ?
i can &apos;t find the remote .
thank you .
scott asked me to come over for lunch and i did .
and ?
and we did .
all right ! way to go !
yea , me !
so how did it happen ?
i took your advice and asked him what was going on .
what did he say ?
he understands how sex can be a very emotional thing for a woman .
and he was just afraid that i was going to get all :
&quot; ls he gonna call me the next day ? &quot; and &quot; where is this going ? &quot;
so he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be serious .
so i said , &quot; okay . relax , please . &quot;
sex can be just about two people right there in the moment .
if he wants to see me again , he can call . if not , that &apos;s fine too .
so after a lot of talking ...
... i convinced him .
let me get this straight .
he got you to beg to sleep with him .
he got you to say he never has to call you again .
and he got you thinking this is a great idea ?
this man is my god !
oh , this one &apos;s cute.don &apos;t you think ?
yeah , and this one , and that one .
they &apos;re all cute . they &apos;re kittens.just wrap one up .
you okay ? .-yeah , me ? .
yeah , yeah . yeah ? .
ross , honey . hey .
i know this is a big step , but i think we &apos;ll be okay .
yeah , i know . i know .
so do you have any cats that are really old or incredibly sick ? .
i don &apos;t want one that &apos;s about to die .
we should &apos;ve worked that out before we came down here .
okay , sweetie .
i &apos;ll narrow it down to this one here ...
... and this one with the stripes .
you pick .
whoa , hey , i have to pick ? .
yeah , whichever one you want .
well , i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s not that easy to choose .
both cats are beautiful ...
... and funny .
i &apos; m sure i &apos;d be happy with either cat .
well , do you want to take both ? .-both ? . both ! ? .
i can &apos;t have two cats !
joey &apos;s the kind of guys who could have two cats .
goodnight , gunther .
i didn &apos;t get a cat .
that &apos;s interesting .
no , it &apos;s not &quot; interesting . &quot; it &apos;s very , very not interesting .
it &apos;s actually 100 % the opposite of interesting .
i got it , ross .
you had no right to say you had feelings for me .
i was doing great with julie before i knew !
i was doing great before i knew about you !
you think it &apos;s easy to see you with julie ?
you should &apos;ve said something before !
i didn &apos;t know then . and how come you never said anything ?
there was never a good time .
you only had a year . and we only hung out every night !
not ...
... every night .
it &apos;s not like i didn &apos;t try . but things got in the way .
you know , like ltalian guys ...
... or ex @-@ fiances ...
... or ltalian guys .
there was one ltalian guy , okay ? and do you have a point ?
the point is , i don &apos;t need this right now !
okay ? it &apos;s too late .
i &apos;m with somebody else . i &apos;m happy . this ship has sailed !
you &apos;re just gonna put away your feelings for me ?
i &apos;ve done it since ninth grade . i &apos;m good at it .
all right , fine . you go ahead and do that .
i don &apos;t need your ship !
good .
good !
and you know what ? now i got closure !
try the bottom one .
monica , it &apos;s 6 : 30 in the morning .
we &apos;re not working out . it &apos;s over .
no way ! with one pound to go ? come on !
we &apos;re workin &apos; , we &apos;re movin &apos; we &apos;re in the zone , we &apos;re groovin&apos;
i don &apos;t mind the last pound .
in fact , i kind of like the last pound .
so don &apos;t make me do anything that i &apos;ll regret .
what you gonna do , fat boy ?
what ?
nothing . except tell you it &apos;s wonderful how much energy you have .
well , thanks .
especially considering how tough it &apos;s been for you to find work .
you can &apos;t tell your parents you were fired , because they &apos;d be disappointed .
it &apos;s not as if you have a boyfriend &apos;s shoulder to cry on .
well , no . but l ....
if it were me , i &apos;d have difficulty getting out of bed at all .
you know , i try to stay positive .
so you ....
you feel like going for a run ?
all right .
because you don &apos;t have to . you could just take a nap right here .
