i asked for an assault not a rampage .
the bitch had her own son beat up
just to get him back home .
this is your e.h.m. bracelet .
if it stays red longer than 30 seconds ,
it &apos;ll notify us that you violated house arrest .
the graysons claim to have two eyewitnesses
who can place you on the beach after tyler barrol was murdered .
i don &apos;t care who you &apos;re protecting or why ,
but as of now , i &apos;m gonna start protecting you .
whatever or whomever you &apos;re doing ,
you &apos;d better damn well be discreet .
we found out amanda &apos;s in montreal .
i &apos;m going after her .
&quot; charlotte grayson was under the influence
of prescription pain pills and champagne
the night of the murder . &quot;
you sold me out .
declan &apos;s recanted his statement about seeing the hooded man
on the beach .
clarence darrow ,
one of history &apos;s greatest lawyers ,
once noted ...
&quot; there is no such thing as justice ,
in or out of court . &quot;
after your examination
of the blood splatter on mr. grayson &apos;s shirt ...
the shooter was standing
approximately 3 feet from the victim ...
perhaps because justice is a flawed concept .
that ultimately comes down to the decision of 12 people .
bang .
killing tyler barrol in cold blood .
people with their own experiences
prejudices , feelings about what defines right and wrong .
the murder weapon ...
fingerprints ...
this gun ...
which is why , when the system fails us ,
we must go out and seek our own justice .
the defendant--
daniel grayson .
how is daniel holding up ?
he &apos;s waiting patiently
for the defense &apos;s turn to present its case .
what about the prosecution &apos;s surprise decision to call
charlotte grayson &apos;s boyfriend as their final witness ?
ex @-@ boyfriend .
declan porter is a highly emotional young man .
are you saying he &apos;s an unreliable witness ?
i &apos;m saying that he &apos;s a teenager nursing his first broken heart .
you can draw your own conclusions .
can you tell us anything more about daniel &apos;s state of mind
at the present moment ?
i &apos;m sorry , but we have no further comment at this time .
thank you so much . ashley , please , just one more--
her name &apos;s amanda clarke . clarke with an &quot; e. &quot;
according to her credit card statement ,
she paid for a couple of nights here last week .
需要我怎么答
here .
ring any bells ?
oh , her .
yeah , i totally partied with her last weekend .
i haven &apos;t done shots like that since high school .
any idea where she was headed ?
new york , i think
not city . it was somewhere upstate , like buffalo .
oh , but not buffalo . it was some other animal name--
deer brook , you know ?
i have a personal acquaintance with declan ...
and i know he &apos;s had a hard time coping with his father &apos;s death
since the summer .
and now with his estrangement from charlotte ...
declan porter is a highly emotional young man .
yello , stowaway .
nolan , hey , it &apos;s me .
jack . how &apos;s omaha ?
somewhere in middle america ?
that credit card statement you hacked into
led me to some crappy motel outside boston .
for a girl with access to $ 5 million ,
it doesn &apos;t make sense .
well , when has anything amanda &apos;s ever done made sense ?
but ... i guess the good news , you &apos;re hot on her trail .
speaking of news ,
the prosecution &apos;s planning on putting declan on the stand ?
yeah . uh , a guy came by with a , um ...
subpoena yesterday .
but don &apos;t worry . i got declan &apos;s back .
you should &apos;ve called me .
don &apos;t--don &apos;t let him talk to anyone till i get home .
got it ?
w @-@ w @-@ wait , wait , wait . y @-@ you &apos;re coming home ?
what about amanda ?
i got my brother to worry about now .
we already know what declan porter &apos;s going to say--
that there was no one else on the beach that night .
which is a lie .
unfortunately , you were under the influence
of prescription pills at the time ,
which means , we can &apos;t put you on the stand
to refute his testimony .
however ,
i do have an expert who will testify
that the blood spatter on daniel &apos;s jacket
shows no evidence he dragged tyler &apos;s body
over 30 yards up the beach .
which means someone else must have .
we just need to get the jury to see it that way .
but before we create reasonable doubt ,
we have to paint daniel as sympathetic ,
which is why i &apos;ve decided to open my argument
by putting
emily on the stand .
emily ?
are you sure that &apos;s a good idea ?
mr. brooks ,
this is an enormous responsibility .
emily isn &apos;t even family yet .
she &apos;s daniel &apos;s fiancee ,
supporting him by choice , not obligation .
it &apos;s your job to appear caring , accessible ,
to articulate for the jury all the reasons
you fell in love with daniel
so they will , too .
well , explaining all the reasons why i love daniel
shouldn &apos;t be difficult .
good , because forensic evidence is not on our side .
we &apos;re going to have to build an emotional connection
between the jury and daniel .
you &apos;re talking as if
they &apos;ve already made up their mind against him .
some of them may have .
juror number three-- ann woodbury--for instance .
in voir dire , she presented as open , impartial ,
but based on her physical reactions
to the prosecution &apos;s evidence ,
it &apos;s likely she &apos;ll vote to convict .
if i can &apos;t at least plant reasonable doubt in her mind ,
we might as well have taken the murder to deal .
perhaps we should reconsider the d.a. &apos; s offer .
unfortunately , it &apos;s no longer on the table .
the case they laid out is a home run , and they know it .
the decision is in the hands of the jury .
a tragic twist in the david clarke trial today .
the wife of juror number seven was the victim
of a deadly carjacking in queens last night .
judge barnes immediately excused the juror ,
who will be replaced with an alternate .
the remaining members of the jury
continue to be sequestered in an undisclosed location
with minimal outside conta .
sorry to interrupt your regularly scheduled plotting .
jack &apos;s en route to montauk
as we speak .
i guess we couldn &apos;t expect him to stay away forever .
at least we managed to keep him out of the graysons &apos; reach
for as long as possible .
what now ?
jack shows his face ,
the graysons are gonna try and pin the murder on him .
no , that &apos;s not gonna happen .
i got your money . what are the details ?
the jury &apos;s sequestered ...
oh ... at the seacliff inn in northampton .
you bugged the queen &apos;s castle ?
you &apos;ll have to pose as a hotel employee to get to her .
the one you want is juror number three--
ann woodbury .
are we clear on what you need to do ?
crystal . and as far as how ?
ms. woodbury is the single mother
of a young son herself .
if she felt her child were in mortal danger ,
hanging a jury would be a small price to pay
to ensure his safety .
got it .
who is she talking to ?
mini frank .
the muscle who flattened jack .
yeah , he also set up daniel &apos;s beating at rikers
and whatever victoria has planned for juror number three .
his name &apos;s lee moran .
he &apos;s been acting as victoria &apos;s pawn for months .
he &apos;s about to become mine .
did you bring the whale cam ?
you do realize that if you expose the graysons
for jury tampering ,
you risk your fiance
spending the rest of his life in prison ?
i came here for one reason .
nothing &apos;s gonna get in my way .
i &apos;m not used to seeing you in that uniform .
i &apos;m not used to seeing you .
i &apos;m sorry .
i know i was gone longer than i planned .
nolan filled in .
upside is , he knows more about precalculus than you do .
the , uh , the downside is , is he &apos;s nolan .
well , i &apos;m glad you &apos;re back .
is that your hoodie ?
you said you were gonna get rid of that , jack .
i might still need it .
look , if the defense decides to go after amanda ,
i &apos;m gonna need to prove that i was there
so they believe me when i say she didn &apos;t do it .
how do you know she didn &apos;t ? what if they think you did it ?
i had no reason to . no motive . no weapon .
you know , it doesn &apos;t matter . it doesn &apos;t matter .
i &apos;m gonna tell the jury
the same thing i &apos;ve been saying all along--
i didn &apos;t see you or anybody else on that beach .
i &apos;m not gonna let you lie in court .
all the hard work you &apos;ve been putting into collins prep
won &apos;t mean a thing with a perjury conviction following you around .
you &apos;re gonna lecture me about right and wrong ?
if you had just handed that hoodie over
and told the cops the truth in the first place ,
we wouldn &apos;t be having this conversation .
you know i can &apos;t do that .
&apos;cause you &apos;re protecting amanda ...
someone you knew when you were 12 .
what about looking out for your family ?
that &apos;s what i &apos;m trying to do right now .
your timing &apos;s way off .
did you hear from any of the galleries ?
as a matter of fact , yeah .
yeah , all the dealers i spoke to ,
even some i didn &apos;t ,
have said they &apos;ll be stopping by for the preview on the weekend .
ah , well , then the word &apos;s officially out .
you &apos;re ready to step out of the shadows .
yeah .
the question is ...
are you ?
well , what do you think ?
it &apos;s stunning .
three months ago , you were unable to finish a painting ,
and here you are now
with an entire collection of your best work .
yeah .
all inspired by you .
again .
i thought i &apos;d save yours till last .
i got the distinct impression
you rather like being left undone .
i do .
there &apos;s hope in it ...
and her path is still unchosen .
maybe it &apos;s time to choose it . hmm ?
maybe it &apos;s time for you to step out of the shadows .
do things differently , yeah ?
yes .
when daniel &apos;s acquitted .
but the shawdows around me are darker than you know .
how do you mean ?
long ago when i told you that i couldn &apos;t love anybody ,
i lied .
i was protecting myself .
from what ?
from loss and hurt .
and then i met you ...
and i was drawn to your volatility and your fire .
then i had to leave because i felt
that if you burned me ,
i would turn to ash .
so i entered a marriage of convenience .
but i always felt the lack of you .
and i walked around in emptiness
until i met him .
who ?
david clarke .
jack .
sorry to just show up out of the blue .
no , um ...
get inside before you turn blue .
it &apos;s freezing out here .
so what happened ?
i thought you were on the road .
i went up and down the entire eastern seaboard
looking for amanda .
but i was always just a day behind .
you haven &apos;t heard from her , have you ?
not a word .
does that worry you ?
the whole thing does .
every clue i &apos;ve uncovered about her
just leads to more questions .
i don &apos;t know if she &apos;s screwing with me
or if she &apos;s in serious trouble .
well , if your gut &apos;s telling you that she &apos;s in trouble ,
maybe you should listen to it .
only i can &apos;t help her if i can &apos;t find her .
it sounds like you should keep looking .
i &apos;m sorry .
here you are ,
your fiance in the middle of a murder trial ,
my brother about to testify against him ,
and i &apos;m unloading all my problems on you .
how are you holding up ?
i &apos;m ...
managing .
come here .
what are you doing out there ?
you &apos;re going to catch your death .
that seems inevitable .
oh , daniel . don &apos;t be morbid .
how about realistic ?
no jury in their right mind
is gonna be sympathetic to me .
you don &apos;t know that yet .
look at my track record .
last summer , i got wasted ,
crashed my car , and nearly paralyzed my girlfriend .
this summer , i shot my best friend .
in self @-@ defense .
in cold blood .
i would &apos;ve fired all three bullets if i had the chance .
that &apos;s a thought the jury is never going to hear .
i hate to admit it ,
but i think that brooks has made the smart move
by putting emily on the stand first .
really ?
well , i &apos;m not so sure about that .
jack porter &apos;s back .
yeah . he &apos;s in her house right now ,
making a fire and god knows what else .
brooks here .
this is victoria grayson .
hello , victoria .
i think we have the break we need for daniel &apos;s defense .
jack porter is back in town .
and if handled properly ,
he &apos;ll lead us directly to amanda clarke .
i suggest that you subpoena him as a hostile witness
before he disappears again .
i &apos;ll get right on it .
thanks .
charlotte .
what ?
i know tomorrow &apos;s going to be a struggle for you ,
hearing that boy tell his side of the story
without you being able to tell yours .
it wouldn &apos;t matter if brooks would just let me testify .
well , brooks is being cautious .
he doesn &apos;t want your drug use to hurt daniel &apos;s case
more than it already has .
thanks , mom .
if you really want to find a way to help ,
get declan to corroborate your story .
yeah , and how am i supposed to do that ?
you &apos;re a resourceful girl .
you &apos;ll find a way .
room service .
i &apos;m sorry . you must have the wrong room .
i &apos;ve already eaten dinner .
well , are you ann woodbury ?
yes .
then i have the right room .
get out of my room . i &apos;m calling security .
you might want to just wait on that .
recognize this kid ?
it &apos;s ...
my son ... matthew .
he &apos;s a sweet boy .
trusting .
walked with me after school all the way to your house .
please .
what do you want ?
hung jury or an acquittal .
otherwise , matthew doesn &apos;t make it past the first grade .
do you get what i &apos;m telling you ?
good .
mention anything to anyone about our conversation ,
and my face is the last one your kid will ever see .
oh , poor little matthew .
you don &apos;t think he &apos;ll hurt him ?
he &apos;s not gonna have any reason to .
victoria played this perfectly .
if there &apos;s anything we &apos;ve learned ,
it &apos;s how far a mother &apos;s willing to go
to protect her son .
wait , wait . what now ?
we turn the tape over to the police
and the graysons get their very own cell block ?
that would be too merciful .
i &apos;m gonna take care of this .
for now , you just make sure that declan sticks to his story
on the stand tomorrow .
if he doesn &apos;t , brooks will have no choice
but to go after jack .
so that &apos;s what this is all about ...
protecting jack ?
he might be willing to sacrifice himself for amanda , but ...
i &apos;m not willing to let him .
declan .
charlotte ?
it &apos;s been a while .
yeah , 58 days .
unless you count that time you told me to get lost
in the cafeteria , then it &apos;s been 31 .
declan , listen ,
i know what &apos;s going on .
my mom &apos;s convinced that guy on the beach is your brother .
and you &apos;re protecting him like i &apos;m protecting my brother .
no one &apos;s saying jack did anything .
but daniel could go to prison for life ,
and it &apos;ll be my fault .
and if you lie ...
it &apos;ll be your fault , too .
this is your chance to fix ...
everything ,
including you and me .
don &apos;t you want that ?
i do .
more than anything .
we can be together again .
all you have to do is tell the truth .
knock , knock , kids .
what do you want , nolan ?
i &apos;m just checking up on you .
mm . i see i &apos;m not the only one .
mind if i talk to you for a minute ?
yeah , i was just leaving .
think about what i said .
you know where to reach me .
so i &apos;m guessing she &apos;s not here to help you on your midterms .
no .
no , she wants me to tell the truth
on the stand tomorrow , same as jack .
what &apos;s stopping you ?
if i come clean
and i tell them that--
that i saw jack standing over tyler &apos;s body ,
man , i don &apos;t know where that &apos;s gonna lead .
what if amanda did shoot tyler ?
what if they go after jack as an accomplice ?
i &apos;ve lost my mom and my dad .
i cannot lose my brother , too .
but if i lie ...
charlotte might lose hers .
and ...
maybe daniel &apos;s guilty .
yeah .
and either way , i might never get charlotte back .
the graysons are ruthless .
they would not hesitate
to have jack take the fall for all of this .
so my advice ...
don &apos;t make it any easier for them .
... the people vs. daniel grayson ,
and sources inside the courtroom tell us
that the prosecution is just moments away
from calling their final witness .
as the defense stated in their opening argument ,
they &apos;re going to try to refute
the overwhelming physical evidence
that we &apos;ve presented
by claiming that daniel grayson was framed ,
that charlotte grayson , the defendant &apos;s sister ,
saw a third person on the beach .
objection . counsel is testifying .
objection sustained .
thank you .
mr. porter ,
will you recount for us
what happened that night on the beach ?
yeah , um ... we were gonna go swimming ,
and , uh , it was cold , so i went to go get us clothes ,
and that &apos;s when i saw that body behind the saw grass--
uh , tyler .
and where was daniel this whole time ?
i don &apos;t know .
he , uh ...
i didn &apos;t see him until everybody ran over .
before that moment , did you see anyone else
anywhere on the beach ?
because in an initial statement charlotte made to the police ,
she said there was someone else .
i know what she said .
why don &apos;t you tell us what you saw ?
was there someone else on that beach that night ?
no .
why should the jury believe your account
over ms. grayson &apos;s ?
because charlotte was drunk
and high on oxycodone that night .
and what about you ?
i &apos;ve never taken drugs in my life .
no further questions .
wait a minute . charlotte &apos;s a good person .
all right ? she &apos;s just lookin &apos; out for her brother .
the prosecution rests , your honor .
i don &apos;t know why you &apos;re so upset .
we knew what he was gonna say .
i was hoping that declan would think twice
before perjuring himself .
obviously , he wasn &apos;t given convincing incentive .
i &apos;ve never trusted either one of those porter boys .
oh , you don &apos;t trust anyone .
that &apos;s not true .
i simply don &apos;t give away my trust as freely as you do .
need i remind you who your fiancee
was sitting next to in court ?
hey . how you holding up ?
what was that about today ?
what , you mean declan &apos;s testimony ?
it &apos;s a setback .
i &apos;m not talking about that .
look , i want to have this conversation face @-@ to @-@ face .
and i obviously can &apos;t come to you , so ...
look , daniel , i @-@ i &apos;m sure you &apos;re going stir crazy .
i can only imagine , but brooks gave me
17 pages of notes for my testimony tomorrow .
i &apos;m first up . i need to be prepared .
and how do you plan to convince 12 strangers
you &apos;re in love with me when i &apos;m not even sure myself ?
wait . daniel , what are you talking about ?
nothing .
i &apos;ll talk to you tomorrow .
it &apos;s declan . leave a message .
declan &apos;s still not picking up .
he just took off after court . i have no idea where he went .
maybe he needs some space .
no , what he needs is a good lawyer .
the defense subpoenaed me .
so now if i tell the truth , i implicate declan ,
but if i don &apos;t--
okay , okay , i @-@ i &apos;ll find you some good legal advice .
thanks .
but before you do , i have some evidence
that places me on the beach that night--
a sweatshirt i was wearing , and tyler &apos;s blood ,
it &apos;s all over it .
you can &apos;t be serious .
once i hire a lawyer ,
i &apos;m gonna do exactly what declan said to do from the start .
i &apos;m gonna hand it over and say what i really saw .
do you have a death wish ?
these are the graysons we &apos;re dealing with .
i can &apos;t expect declan to do the right thing
when i haven &apos;t .
you gonna help me or not ?
yeah . i &apos;ll make some calls .
hello .
we &apos;re at defcon 1 , ems .
jack &apos;s been sitting-- not literally--on a hoodie
that directly links him to the murder .
what ?
where are you , the stowaway ?
that would be an affirmative .
and i &apos;m supposed to be finding jack a good lawyer .
no , don &apos;t bother . he won &apos;t need one .
just try to get him out of there for a couple of hours , okay ?
okay .
any luck ?
yes and ... no .
you know what ? i am worried about declan .
let &apos;s go for a drive .
let &apos;s see if we can find him .
yeah .
come in .
miss charlotte , you have a visitor .
just like old times .
only now i don &apos;t have to climb up a drain pipe .
a lot &apos;s changed if your mom &apos;s
letting guys in the bedroom now .
she &apos;s not .
if my parents find out about this ,
i &apos;ll tell my dad you &apos;re the one
who drank his 85 @-@ year @-@ old scotch .
that was hot .
shut the door .
so did you bring &apos; em ?
you &apos;re all business now , aren &apos;t you ?
i like it .
nice . how &apos;d you get so many ?
i stole one of my dad &apos;s scrip pads .
just so you know ...
this is gonna cost you a little extra .
money &apos;s not a problem .
it &apos;s not money i &apos;m after .
the little rat from montauk &apos;s
been out of the picture long enough .
what &apos;s stopping me and you ?
absolutely nothing .
well , if it isn &apos;t the infamous dominik wright .
conrad grayson .
expecting someone else i bet .
as a matter of fact , yeah , i &apos;ve got a showing .
so if you don &apos;t mind--
oh , yes , i had my people contact the few galleries
who were expressing interest ,
and we just let them know that your current collection &apos;s
already spoken for .
wow .
you really have been carrying on with my wife .
your ex @-@ wife .
well , uh , it hasn &apos;t been finalized yet .
so what , you , um ,
you been having her followed ?
well , it behooves a person in my position
to cover his bases .
and i &apos;ve also had you investigated .
it seems that you have been nurturing
quite a shady existence .
i mean , dealing in black market auctions ,
allegations of forgeries .
well , allegations are just that , aren &apos;t they ?
allegations .
i mean , you of all people should know that
innocent till proven guilty .
oh , yeah , but i have proof in the form of
抽象表现主义的灵魂人物之一
my very first de kooning that i purchased ,
brokered by a fetching young vicky harper years ago .
you see , i had that painting appraised
when i found out that she &apos;d sunk back in with you ,
and it turns out that de kooning
is worth less than the frame it &apos;s in .
so what do you want ?
you want your money back , hmm ?
or do you want to just excise me
like you did to the last man she loved ?
oh , yeah , she told me
what you did to david clarke .
she told you what i did ?
what you both did .
yeah , well , eventually , you would &apos;ve learned
that victoria &apos;s word is about as authentic
as the paintings you forged .
but to answer your question ,
no , i &apos;m not here to excise you .
i know i &apos;m not the only wealthy collector
you and victoria worked your con on all those years ago .
so if you really want to finalize victoria &apos;s shame ,
i could have her arrested
for knowingly brokering forged classics .
or ...
you could do the noble thing .
you could take your current spate of masterpieces
and you could clear out of this joint .
and leave nothing behind ...
but my wife .
you know , you might wanna leave ...
before i break every one
of the 14 bones in your face .
daniel , what are you doing ?
i could ask you the same thing .
you can &apos;t be here . your ankle monitor--
i &apos;m not leaving until you tell me
what the hell you &apos;re really up to .
maybe my mom was right about you .
maybe tyler was , too .
how much have you had to drink ?
don &apos;t change the subject .
i saw you yesterday with jack .
is that where you went , to see him ?
daniel , stop--
you think i &apos;m an idiot ?
all the mysterious phone calls ,
all the times you disappeared ...
have you been sneaking around with him the whole time ?
that &apos;s ridiculous--
don &apos;t lie to me !
i &apos;m sorry--
freeze ! right there . freeze !
hands where i can see &apos; em .
hands up . don &apos;t move . hands up .
get down . let &apos;s go . facedown .
down .
daniel grayson , you &apos;re in direct violation
of your house arrest .
how long before daniel &apos;s released back to us , mr. brooks ?
i &apos;m heading to rikers now
to get daniel &apos;s side of the story .
once i have the facts , i &apos;ll set a meeting with the judge .
all right . well , i &apos;ll be there first thing in the morning .
i really have no idea why he &apos;d violate house arrest .
i do .
let me call you back .
daniel thought that i was having an affair with jack .
i assured him that that wasn &apos;t true ,
that ... i &apos;m not that kind of person .
but the truth is , i have been getting closer to jack ...
to get information on amanda .
jack claims he doesn &apos;t know where she is .
and you don &apos;t believe him ?
i went to the stowaway to search his apartment .
what did you find ?
nothing .
as far as i can tell , jack &apos;s telling the truth .
if the jury convicts daniel for this ,
i &apos;ll never forgive myself .
well , that makes two of us .
but fortunately , there are other factors
that might help shape the jury &apos;s opinion .
for example ?
your testimony , of course .
so go home , emily ,
and tomorrow deliver the performance of your life .
what the hell ?
yeah , we got robbed ,
suffolk county police .
&apos;cause that &apos;s what this day needed .
what town ?
montauk .
please hold .
yeah , i &apos;ll hold .
hey , i &apos;m on with the police .
hang on .
computer ...
tv--nothing &apos;s missing .
oh , god .
what ? what ?
what are you doing ?
hang up the phone .
what ?
hang up the phone !
the hoodie ... it &apos;s gone .
hands over your head .
what &apos;s the problem ?
is this your vehicle ?
what of it ?
以女童安珀 · 海格曼绑架撕票案命名 。
an amber alert was issued .
put your hands behind your back .
what the hell ? i didn &apos;t kidnap anybody .
relax . matches your plates .
oh , come on .
what &apos;s that ?
on your sweatshirt , is that blood ?
that &apos;s not mine . that &apos;s not mine .
lee moran , you &apos;re under arrest .
oh , come on . that &apos;s not my sweatshirt .
you have the right to remain silent .
i &apos;m being set up .
anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law .
man , ems , when you said you were gonna use lee
as your pawn ,
you weren &apos;t kidding .
checkmate .
what happens if they find jack &apos;s d.n.a.
on the hoodie ?
they &apos;ll link it to the night that lee beat up jack ,
reinforcing his status as the grayson family goon .
so in one fell swoop ,
you managed to protect jack , exonerate daniel ,
and force lee into selling out the graysons
to save himself .
haven &apos;t you tied everything up in one neat little bow ?
almost .
are you at the stowaway ?
mm . standing right outside .
good .
there &apos;s one loose end i &apos;m leaving to you .
so you think the graysons had the guy who beat me up
break in here a second time and steal my hoodie ?
the graysons did what ?
it &apos;s just a hypothesis , but it makes sense , doesn &apos;t it ?
so then i &apos;m screwed .
au contraire .
because according to the police scanner ,
they found the bloody hoodie when they picked the dirtbag up .
the graysons can &apos;t exactly admit their association to the guy ,
so their lawyer &apos;s gonna have to make it look like
he &apos;s the killer .
you really think they &apos;re capable of that ?
they hired the guy to beat you half to death ,
didn &apos;t they ?
the graysons are capable of anything
when it comes to protecting their family .
how did they even know i had it ?
you guys were the only two people i told .
i ... well , who knows ?
maybe the guy really did murder tyler .
maybe he even saw you on the beach that night .
at this point ,
i &apos;d advise against digging any deeper .
take the win , jack .
this call will be recorded .
you have a collected call from ...
your worst nightmare .
at rikers correctional facility .
to connect , press 5 now .
we have a problem .
i &apos;m sorry . who is this ?
they found a bloody sweatshirt in my car .
they &apos;re saying it matches the blood
of the kid your son shot .
what ?
did you set me up ?
because there &apos;s no way i &apos;m taking the fall
for something i didn &apos;t do .
stop harassing me .
you won &apos;t get a penny from us .
get me outta this or get ready , lady .
because if i &apos;m going down , i &apos;m taking you down with me ,
straight to hell where you belong .
you threaten me and my children again ,
and i will go straight to the police .
what was that about ?
we need to call brooks .
no , you need to speak to me first .
who was that ?
what on god &apos;s earth have you done , victoria ?
so let me get this straight .
you paid a thug
to have our son beaten up in prison ,
and then what , strong @-@ arm a juror ,
when this guy could &apos;ve been the very reason
daniel &apos;s even on trial in the first place ?
lee didn &apos;t kill tyler . it doesn &apos;t make any sense .
he was set up .
by whom , for instance ?
jack porter .
he knew what lee looked like .
he could &apos;ve orchestrated the whole thing
to protect the real killer .
let me guess . amanda clarke .
you have really lost it , you know that ?
did it even occur to you
how much you &apos;ve risked both our lives
and daniel &apos;s with this ?
i will categorically deny anything lee has to say .
he was blackmailing us .
well , that &apos;s not gonna be enough .
once that punk starts talking to save his skin ,
it &apos;s gonna lead investigators
all the way down the rabbit hole to us .
leave me alone . i need to think .
this will be second mess of yours
i &apos;ve had to clean up in one day .
what is that supposed to mean ?
i don &apos;t know .
why don &apos;t you go and ask your artist friend ?
not that i expect you &apos;ll find him .
i mean , once a fraud , always a fraud .
isn &apos;t that right , victoria ?
you stay away from him !
no problem there . he &apos;s long gone by now .
oh , you ... bastard .
the last time i wrote you from this place ,
i told you i was innocent .
that &apos;s not really the case .
i may not have fired the shot that killed tyler ,
but i did shoot him ...
because he made me doubt you ...
because he said you &apos;d betray me .
but i &apos;m the one who betrayed you .
and now i &apos;m getting what i deserve ,
which is why i &apos;m gonna do us both a favor
and end this now .
open 2 @-@ 7 @-@ 7 !
holy hell .
the coroner &apos;s been notified .
c.s.i. on the way .
mr. brooks , thanks for coming down .
what &apos;s happening out there ?
they &apos;re saying someone hanged himself .
and confessed to killing tyler in a suicide note .
what ?
still want to change your plea ?
i didn &apos;t think so .
i &apos;ll get started getting your charges dropped .
justice , like beauty ,
is in the eye of the beholder .
federal authorities have confirmed the death
of terrorist david clarke ,
who was stabbed yesterday when a fight broke out ...
some see an innocent victim .
others see evil incarnate getting exactly what &apos;s deserved .
i got your message .
what &apos;s wrong ? what happened ?
i was wasting my time ...
gathering evidence on jury tampering when ...
the graysons have so much more to pay for .
sorry to have put us in this position again ,
especially after all these years .
we have another david clarke @-@ style situation .
that &apos;s very troubling news .
the name &apos;s moran .
wait . is that conrad ?
lee moran .
he &apos;s in a holding cell at rikers .
if he starts talking ,
i don &apos;t see how we keep a lid on our association .
all of the research that i did ...
everybody that i talked to , they said that ...
it was just a prison fight ...
that my dad was knifed to death by an inmate .
how did i not know this ?
