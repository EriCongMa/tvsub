checkmate .
again ?
obviously ,
you &apos;re not well suited for three @-@ dimensional chess .
perhaps three @-@ dimensional candy land would be more your speed .
just reset the board .
it must be humbling to suck on so many different levels .
hey , guys .
did you get my mail ?
yeah , right here .
how was nebraska ?
well , better than north dakota .
i guess that joke &apos;s only funny in nebraska .
from the data at hand , you really can &apos;t draw that conclusion .
all you can say with absolute certainty is that
that joke is not funny here .
boy , it &apos;s good to be back .
how &apos;s your family ?
it was the worst trip .
everyone got sick over the weekend .
sick ?
here we go .
what kind of sick ?
the flu , i guess .
i don &apos;t need you to guess . i need you to know .
now , when did the symptoms first appear ?
maybe friday .
friday. was that morning or afternoon ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t ...
think , woman. who blew their nose and when ?
sheldon , relax .
she doesn &apos;t have any symptoms . i &apos;m sure she &apos;s not contagious .
oh , please .
if influenza was only contagious after symptoms appear ,
it would have died out thousands of years ago .
somewhere between tool using and cave painting ,
homo habilis would have figured out
how to kill the guy with the runny nose .
penny , you &apos;ll have to excuse sheldon. he &apos;s a bit of a germaphobe .
it &apos;s okay . i understand .
thanks for your consideration. now please leave .
you &apos;d better go before he starts spraying you with lysol .
okay. well , thank you for getting my mail .
no problem. welcome home .
what ? !
what the hell are you doing ?
i &apos;m making petri dishes to grow throat cultures .
with lime jell @-@ o ?
i need a growth medium ,
and someone polished off the apricot yogurt .
here , swab my throat .
i don &apos;t think so .
if i &apos;m going to get ahead of this thing ,
i need to find out what &apos;s growing in my throat .
sheldon , you are not sick .
this is , but you are not .
we have no idea what pathogen typhoid
penny has introduced into our environment .
for having never been to nebraska ,
i &apos;m fairly certain that i have no corn @-@ husking antibodies .
sheldon , don &apos;t you think you &apos;re overreacting ?
when i &apos;m lying comatose in a hospital
relying on inferior minds to cure me ,
these jell @-@ o cultures and my accompanying notes
will give them a fighting chance .
i &apos;m going back to bed .
wait .
put this in the bathroom .
what for ?
i need to measure my fluid intake and output
to make sure my kidneys aren &apos;t shutting down .
i mixed pancake batter in this !
no , that measuring cup has always been for urine .
you had time to make a label for everything in this apartment
including the label maker ,
but you didn &apos;t have ten seconds to make one that said &quot; urine cup &quot; ?
it &apos;s right here on the bottom .
i guess i owe the betty crocker company a letter of apology .
oh , dear god .
leonard , i &apos;m sick !
leonard , i &apos;m sick !
leonard , my comforter fell down , and my sinuses hurt when i bend over .
hey ! -leonard , where are you ?
i &apos;m at work .
at 6 : 30 in the morning ?
on sunday ?
why ?
they asked me to come in .
i didn &apos;t hear the phone ring .
they texted me .
well , as i predicted , i am sick .
my fever has been tracking up exponentially since 2 : 00 a.m. ,
and i am producing sputum at an alarming rate .
no kidding ?
no , not only that ,
it has shifted from clear to milky green .
all right ,
get some rest and drink plenty of fluids .
what else would i drink , gases , solids , ionized plasma ?
drink whatever you want .
i want soup .
then make soup .
we don &apos;t have soup .
i &apos;m at work , sheldon .
is that a dog ?
in the lab ?
they &apos;re training dogs to operate the centrifuge
for when they need dogs to ...
operate the centrifuge
for blind scientists . i have to go .
howard , it &apos;s the phone !
i know it &apos;s the phone , ma , i hear the phone !
well , who &apos;s calling at this ungodly hour ? !
i don &apos;t know !
well , ask them why they &apos;re calling at this ungodly hour !
how can i ask them when i &apos;m talking to you ? !
hello .
it &apos;s leonard. code milky green .
dear lord , not milky green .
affirmative. with fever .
who &apos;s on the phone ? !
it &apos;s leonard !
why is he calling ? !
sheldon &apos;s sick !
were you playing with him ? !
for god &apos;s sake , ma , i &apos;m 26 years old !
excuse me , mr. grownup !
what do you want for breakfast ? !
chocolate milk and eggos , please !
listen to me .
hang on. call waiting .
no , don &apos;t ... !
hello .
howard , i &apos;m sick .
howard &apos;s sleeping. this is his mother !
why are you calling at this ungodly hour ?
i need soup .
then call your own mother !
it was sheldon .
i tried to stop you .
it &apos;s my own fault .
i forgot the protocol we put in place
after the great ear infection of 06 .
you call koothrappali .
we need to find a place to lay low for the next 18 to 24 hours .
stand by .
ma , can my friends come over ?
i just had the carpet steamed !
that &apos;s a negatory .
but there &apos;s a planet of the apes marathon at the nuart today .
five movies , two hours apiece ..
it &apos;s a start .
homeless , crazy guy at table 18 .
no , just crazy .
sheldon , what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m sick. thank you very much .
how could you have gotten if from me ? i &apos;m not sick .
you &apos;re a carrier .
all these people here are doomed .
you &apos;re doomed !
sheldon , what do you want ?
i want soup .
why didn &apos;t you ... ?
why didn &apos;t you just have soup at home ?
penny , i have an iq of 187 .
don &apos;t you imagine that if there were a way for me
to have had soup at home , i would have thought of it ?
you can have soup delivered .
i did not think of that .
clearly , febrile delirium is setting in .
please bring me some soup
while i still understand what a spoon is for .
what kind of soup do you want ?
well , my mother used to make me this split pea
with little frankfurter slices and these homemade croutons .
we have chicken , tortilla and potato leek .
could i get any of those with little frankfurter slices
and homemade croutons ? no .
then surprise me .
would you call that &quot; moss green &quot; or &quot; forest green &quot; ?
look at this. everyone went chimp .
i &apos;d like to point out that i voted for orangutan ,
but you shouted me down !
hi , penny .
hey , where are you ?
i &apos;m ... at work .
you sound funny .
look . i &apos;m ... i &apos;m in a radiation suit .
what &apos;s up ?
i &apos;m at work , too ,
and you &apos;ll never guess who &apos;s here infecting my entire station .
sheldon &apos;s at the cheesecake factory .
just tell him to go home .
he won &apos;t leave .
he &apos;s afraid he &apos;ll pass out on the bus ,
and someone will harvest his organs .
he &apos;s paranoid , and he &apos;s established a nest .
can you please come get him ?
yeah , i &apos;d be happy to .
oh , my god , there &apos;s a breach in the radiation unit !
the whole city is in jeopardy ! oh , my god !
the containment vessel &apos;s melting. gotta go. bye !
i feel really guilty .
you did what you had to do .
take your stinking paws off my popcorn ,
you damn dirty ape !
thanks for bringing me home .
it &apos;s okay . i didn &apos;t really need to work today .
it &apos;s not like i have rent or car payments or anything .
good , good .
okay , well , you feel better .
wait ! where are you going ?
home ... to write some bad checks .
you &apos;re going to leave me ?
sheldon , you are a grown man. haven &apos;t you ever been sick before ?
of course , but not by myself .
really ? never ?
well , once , when i was 15,
spending the summer at the heidelberg institute in germany .
studying abroad ?
no. visiting professor .
anyway , the local cuisine was a little more sausage @-@ based
than i &apos;m used to , and the result was an internal blitzkrieg ,
with my lower intestine playing the part of czechoslovakia .
and there was no one there to take care of you ?
my mom had to fly back to texas to help my dad ,
because the house had slipped off the cinder blocks again .
again ?
it was tornado season .
and it was an aluminum house .
the housekeeper in the faculty residence didn &apos;t speak any english .
when i finally managed to convince her i was sick ,
she said , &quot; mochtest du eine darmspfilung ? &quot;
what does that mean ?
based on what happened next , i assume it means ,
&quot; would you like an enema ? &quot;
okay , sweetie . i &apos;ll take care of you .
what do you need ?
my mom used to give me sponge baths .
ok ground rules . no sponge baths ,
and definitely no enemas .
agreed .
here we go .
ten @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half hours of ape @-@ y goodness .
damn it , my glasses .
okay , i &apos;m blind here , guys. can you help me find them ?
sorry .
okay .
found them .
oh , great .
i &apos;m sorry. don &apos;t you have a spare ?
yeah , at home .
if you leave now ,
you can be back before the gorillas rip the crap out of charlton heston .
unless sheldon &apos;s there , in which case , you &apos;ll be trapped forever
in his whiny , hyper @-@ neurotic snot web .
hi. penny ?
i was just wondering , is sheldon still at the restaurant ?
okay , that was very nice of you. okay , i gotta go .
got kind of a full @-@ blown chernobyl thing here. gotta go , bye .
he &apos;s home . i &apos;m screwed .
ten @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half hours of ape @-@ y blurriness .
how about lasik ?
you want me to get eye surgery ?
would you rather go home and deal with sheldon ,
or have a stranger carve out your corneas with a laser beam ?
well ?
i &apos;m thinking .
okay , nice and cozy .
okay ? i &apos;ll see you later .
wait .
will you please rub this on my chest ?
sheldon , can &apos;t you do that yourself ?
vaporub makes my hands smell funny .
but , sheldon ...
please , please , please ?
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m doing this .
no , no. counterclockwise , or my chest hair mats .
sorry .
can you sing &quot; soft kitty &quot; ?
what ?
my mom used to sing it to me when i was sick .
oh , sorry , honey . i don &apos;t know it .
i &apos;ll teach you .
soft kitty , warm kitty ,
little ball of fur
happy kitty , sleepy kitty ,
purr , purr , purr
now you .
soft kitty ,
warm kitty ...
little ball of fur
keep rubbing .
little ball of fur
what do you see ? i can &apos;t .
the living room appears to be empty .
he must be in his bedroom .
my spare glasses are in my bedroom , on my dresser ,
next to my bat signal .
i &apos;m not going in there .
raj ?
no way , jose .
but i can &apos;t do it . i can &apos;t see anything .
it &apos;s all right. wireless minicam and bluetooth headset .
we &apos;ll be your eyes .
fine .
one more thing .
this is a subsonic impact sensor .
if sheldon gets out of bed and starts to walk ,
this device will register it and send a signal to the laptop .
at that point , based on the geography of the apartment
and the ambulatory speed of a sick sheldon ,
you &apos;ll have 7 seconds to get out , glasses or no glasses .
won &apos;t my footsteps set it off ?
no. you &apos;ll be on your hands and knees .
you &apos;ll need to get the sensor as close as you can to sheldon &apos;s room .
how do i carry it if i &apos;m on my hands and knees ?
stay low .
bear left .
now keep true .
what ?
it means &quot; go straight . &quot;
then just say , &quot; go straight . &quot;
you don &apos;t say , &quot; go straight . &quot;
when you &apos;re giving bearings , you say , &quot; keep true . &quot;
all right .
i just hit my head .
because you didn &apos;t keep true .
okay , turn right .
the picture &apos;s breaking up .
angle your head to the right .
now , a little more .
little more .
that &apos;s it. now , just keep true .
you &apos;re close enough to sheldon &apos;s room. deploy the sensor .
now , turn it on .
it wasn &apos;t on ?
then why did i have to crawl ?
no , i guess you didn &apos;t .
okay , it &apos;s on .
good. from this point forward , you will have to crawl .
i know .
hang on , the sensor &apos;s picking up something. turn your head back .
you rat bastard .
told you the sensor would work .
you deliberately stuck me with sheldon .
come on , i had to. you see what he &apos;s like ?
penny , i &apos;m hungry .
it &apos;s okay , sweetie. good news ! leonard &apos;s home !
here you go. good luck. bye .
leonard ! i &apos;m hungry !
penny , take me with you !
i want grilled cheese .
do you think penny will come here and take care of us ?
i don &apos;t think penny &apos;s ever coming here again .
i &apos;m very congested .
yeah ? so ?
could you go to the kitchen
and get me the turkey baster labeled &quot; mucous &quot; ?
if i stand , i &apos;ll vomit .
