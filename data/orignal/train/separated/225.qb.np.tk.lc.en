gossip girl here--
your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
ivy , stop talking to your boyfriend and start working .
charlie ! oh , my gosh !
what are you doing here ?
&quot; the beautiful and the damned &quot; wraps in a week ,
but how would you like to keep working for me ?
i would love to .
what are you looking for over there ?
my phone .
i think i left it at the fashion show
when the assistant checked it in .
i &apos;m not interested in interviews with new york &apos;s elite .
i want their secrets and scandals .
you had everyone &apos;s phones taken .
why didn &apos;t you just , you know , look at some of them ?
do you know someone called ivy ?
the truth is , i can &apos;t wait to be a father ,
a @-@ and now i &apos;m going to be one .
i never intended to publish &quot; inside . &quot;
somehow it fell into
simon &amp; schuster &apos;s laps .
it &apos;s a satire of my entire life
and everyone i know .
you didn &apos;t write this book . i did .
bravo ! he did it !
i told you i &apos;d get him to step forward .
dan humphrey ,
alessandra steele , my agent .
it &apos;s brilliant .
really exceptional .
loved the book .
do i know you ? any of you ?
do i know anyone here at all ?
the ending ...
just slays me .
slays me how you &apos;re all alone with no friends left ...
well--
surrounded by people who think
they know you but really don &apos;t .
it &apos;s genius .
right , but , uh , it &apos;s not me .
it &apos;s the character dylan hunter .
the book , is , uh , the book is fiction .
well , i &apos;m happy to tell you it &apos;s a brilliant piece of fiction
that &apos;s number 38 on the amazon preorder list .
25,000 shipped so far .
quick question . how big can my head get before it explodes ?
half the buys are probably upper east siders
dying to see if they &apos;re in it .
yeah .
some of my friends might feel they are .
they &apos;re coming tonight , right ?
to--to the book party ?
no . i ... haven &apos;t exactly mentioned it to them yet .
um , i &apos;d have to tell them the book exists first .
they don &apos;t know ? not any of them ?
no .
and i &apos;m not sure they &apos;re gonna like it
when they find out .
if they &apos;re really your friends ,
they &apos;ll be happy to see your star rise ,
and they should be at the soiree tonight
when everybody learns that &quot; anonymous &quot;
is actually daniel humphrey .
i &apos;m gonna need six copies of this book , uh ,
that should probably be hand @-@ delivered .
i &apos;ll see you later at giorgio armani for your suit fitting ?
and don &apos;t shave .
makes you look like a real writer .
i now understand why women used to go into confinement .
it wasn &apos;t because of modesty but vanity .
look at my boobs .
oh , i &apos;m huge .
are you even listening ?
sorry , darling .
i was just reading
about how some pregnant women have mood swings .
apparently , they didn &apos;t know you before the pregnancy .
oh , you look gorgeous .
i @-@ i can &apos;t wait to tell
the whole world the good news .
me , too .
my mother and beatrice arrive tonight .
and i asked my mom and cyrus
to join us for dinner at the consulate .
and then we &apos;ll tell everyone together .
you don &apos;t think your family is gonna be upset , do you ?
i don &apos;t want them to think of me
as the star of some trashy mtv show
like &quot; unmarried and pregnant princesses &quot;
or , i don &apos;t know , &quot; royally screwed . &quot;
my mother will be over the moon .
the job of any princess is to provide an heir to the kingdom .
and that is exactly what you are doing .
an heir to a kingdom lives within me .
how very shakespeare .
a comedy , not a tragedy , i hope .
so do i ,
which is why i have to tell one person
before we meet up with the families .
and i can do that right now .
yeah , we received the latest draft .
it &apos;s on jane &apos;s desk .
okay , i &apos;ll have her call you . thank you .
morning , everyone .
i &apos;m on a juice fast this week .
not going to be pretty .
um , i will put those in the fridge for you .
i &apos;ll also request an extra cashew drink .
it makes the day bearable .
事务一览表
yes .
的新闻报道
is on your desk , as well as
the new spec script that sony
won in the bidding war .
what is it again ?
&quot; american psycho &quot; in prep school .
make it go away .
also , um , i know that it &apos;s a long shot ,
but i sent daniel day @-@ lewis
&quot; the blue rose , &quot;
along with a note and a rosebush that only grows in ireland .
i don &apos;t know . i thought it might be a special touch .
daniel never agrees to do anything .
the man took three years to make a pair of shoes .
but i like that you &apos;re putting it out there . sam ?
yes ?
could you get me and serena two green teas ?
yeah , sure . happy to .
i knew that my instincts were right hiring you .
you &apos;re a smart cookie .
you can look at your phone . i don &apos;t run a gulag .
thank you .
that &apos;s piper van allen . and that &apos;s sullivan baker .
and i care about their pg @-@ 13 pictures because ...
cause piper is married to jason van allen .
oh , well , i am slightly more interested .
yeah , and sullivan &apos;s with that celebrity florist guy .
i think they got married in amagansett this summer .
oh . that &apos;s a twist i wasn &apos;t expecting .
yeah .
well , our phone swipe at the jenny packham show
gave us some pretty good stories .
yeah , but pretty good isn &apos;t perfect .
if only we had blair waldorf &apos;s phone .
i told you , she &apos;s my friend . my friends are off @-@ limits .
oh . morals .
how quaint .
i mean , why do you even hold on to that phone
if you &apos;re not gonna answer it ?
because i don &apos;t have to explain how i got it .
but i am too intrigued by our mysterious &quot; ivy &quot;
to just toss it away .
well , we could always lie , say we found it on the street .
how are we gonna find her ?
look . there are no names in the phone , only numbers .
and there was no tag for her at the party .
well , maybe she was just a crasher . you know , a nobody .
mm . nobodies don &apos;t hide their friends .
they advertise them .
i have a feeling about this girl .
wait a second . hold on . i know that number .
yeah ?
all right , well , i &apos;ll be back in a bit ,
hopefully with a new lead .
your call has been forwarded to an automated--
still haven &apos;t found your phone ?
no , and i &apos;ve been calling it nonstop .
well , maybe it &apos;s time for a new one .
new city , new cell phone . hmm ?
yeah , but my whole world &apos;s in that phone .
final mix of panic &apos;s debut album .
this is so exciting .
yeah , it &apos;s been a long time coming .
do you ever regret not getting back into music sooner , rufus ?
nah . no ,
i wouldn &apos;t give up raising my kids for anything .
i mean , i love music , but dan and jenny--they &apos;re my life .
okay , everybody ready ?
maybe that &apos;s dan . i was hoping he would join .
good boy .
hello .
mm . do you know what this summoning is about ?
i do but i can &apos;t say . i &apos;m sworn to secrecy .
since when do you bite your tongue ?
i &apos;m learning .
well , isn &apos;t humphrey becoming quite the drama queen ?
isn &apos;t that usually your role ?
i prefer drama princess now .
how are you , by the way ?
i &apos;m okay .
thanks for asking .
sorry . squirrels .
shall we ?
what are you guys doing here ?
we must have all gotten the same text from dan .
the last time he was this secretive ,
he showed up with a baby .
don &apos;t worry . you &apos;re not about to become a grandfather ,
though dan is about to give birth in another way .
okay , i &apos;m pretty sure this is how every murder mystery begins .
serena , how was your job ?
uh , really great , actually .
so great she has no time for me .
well , i would if you weren &apos;t asleep
every time i got home .
uh , i &apos;m still jet @-@ lagged .
haven &apos;t you been home for weeks ?
it certainly feels that way when i &apos;m around you .
serena , quick question .
you don &apos;t happen to know a girl named ivy , do you ?
uh , i don &apos;t think so . why ?
oh . well , i found her cell ,
but i don &apos;t know how to get it back to her .
your number was in her phone book .
what &apos;s her number ? i &apos;ll dial it .
look ! here &apos;s dan .
hey , everyone . thank you so much for coming .
i only have five minutes .
this better be really important .
what is this all about ?
is everything all right ?
this isn &apos;t about me , right ?
yeah , what &apos;s going on , dan ?
this is going to be fun .
i &apos;m sorry to call everyone here on such short notice ,
but , uh ...
all right , you know how there &apos;s been
all this speculation about the book that &apos;s being published
by an anonymous author ?
yeah . gossip girl said it was about us .
yeah , it was probably written
by some loser who doesn &apos;t even know us .
well , not exactly .
i am that loser .
i wrote it .
and it is based on ... you--sort of--all of you .
looks like it &apos;s going to be
a hot time in this old town tonight .
let &apos;s just hope lonely boy and his book
don &apos;t go up in flames .
hey . what are you doing ?
i thought you were waiting downstairs .
i &apos;m tired of waiting .
when are you gonna tell them ?
soon . i promise .
&quot; soon &quot; isn &apos;t soon enough .
it &apos;s time they all knew about us .
what &apos;s so funny ?
i think you should ask dan .
i @-@ i might &apos;ve made your character ...
a little ...
gay .
i hope that &apos;s okay . stop enjoying this so much .
you wanted me to feel something . that &apos;s a feeling .
do i have game ?
oh , definitely .
i &apos;m cool with that .
i @-@ i know it &apos;s gonna be a little weird
with everyone reading characters inspired by themselves ,
but i @-@ i wanna make it clear ...
this book is a work of fiction .
and after you read it ,
i hope that you &apos;ll feel good enough about it and me
that , you will come to this book party tonight .
the publisher is announcing that i &apos;m the author . so ...
yeah . of course we &apos;ll be there .
well , read it first and then decide because i ...
you know , i didn &apos;t have a lot of time to make changes ,
and there are some instances
where it &apos;s not exactly how i would &apos;ve wanted it .
well , an artist never feels his work is perfect .
but it &apos;s good to always strive for more .
i am so proud of you , son .
i am gonna cancel my whole day with panic
just so i can savor your book .
so ... now that this unnecessary meeting
about america &apos;s future doorstop is adjourned ,
do you wanna go grab a cup of decaf ?
oh , i would love to , b. , but i &apos;m already late for work .
i gotta get back .
well , maybe after work then ?
if this is about the book , don &apos;t worry .
everyone loves a villain .
i wouldn &apos;t say there &apos;s a villain , per se .
well , i can tell you who isn &apos;t .
come on . every girl needs to be knocked off her pedestal a little .
can &apos;t handle that kind of pressure .
i &apos;ll see you later .
you know that story i wrote that louis killed ?
it &apos;s in the book ?
yeah , i figured . but if it &apos;s all the same to you ,
i think i &apos;d like to stay in the dark
about just how nastily you &apos;ve portrayed me .
yeah , that &apos;s a good idea .
i mean , you know , we &apos;re just recently friends again .
why ruin a good thing ?
yeah , and , i &apos;m sorry in advance ,
but i have a better offer than your party tonight .
louis and i are telling our families our news .
good luck .
you , too .
your novel seems to be , very well @-@ punctuated ,
and i liked the font .
yeah . i &apos;ll , i &apos;ll be right over . bye .
a book written about you guys . it sounds exciting .
i hope he wasn &apos;t writing it when i went nutso last year .
trust me , there was enough insanity around
before you even got here .
so ...
you and serena were talking about a girl named ivy ?
上见过
with that name .
can i help ?
actually , yeah .
i was just hoping to find her and give her phone back .
i think she was with one of lily &apos;s society friends .
maybe we could look through her phone contacts ,
jog my memory ?
i left it at the office , but yeah , i could do that .
do you happen to remember what she looks like ?
blonde ...
boobs ...
botox ?
that pretty much describes everyone at the event .
if i saw her , i &apos;d probably recognize her .
what &apos;d i miss ?
nigel kirstein called for you ,
and we got an advance copy of this new book
by some anonymous new york insider ,
and everyone in town is trying to figure out who .
well , i know who . i used to date him .
shut up .
no way . you &apos;re &quot; sabrina &quot; ?
the dreamy blonde with the legs .
i guess i am .
hi , this is
serena van der woodsen returning .
yeah , i &apos;ll hold .
did you actually
have cases of champagne delivered to your school ?
is that what he wrote ?
no , a friend was pulling a prank on me .
but it happened ?
that was in high school .
keep reading .
you &apos;ll see i mature as he gets to know me better .
hey . oh , no , it &apos;s great to hear from you , too .
what ?
daniel day @-@ lewis
responded to my letter about &quot; the blue rose &quot; ?
himself ?
yeah . no , of--of course .
okay , thank you so much .
what was that ?
that was his manager .
they--they wanna set up a conference call
to talk about the project .
i have to tell jane right now .
oh . dylan hunter said everything comes easy for you .
keep reading . i told you .
i &apos;m almost through .
so ... i was thinking &quot; pierre &quot; maybe if it &apos;s a boy ,
since it &apos;s a grimaldi family name .
why not &quot; charles &quot; ?
it &apos;s a name that seems to have special significance to you .
w @-@ what ?
louis , is something wrong ?
i know you were with chuck .
is that who you needed to tell our news to ?
no .
it was serena , and i didn &apos;t even get a chance to .
dan gathered us all together
because he wrote some novel about everyone ,
and he wanted to make sure we knew about it first .
but the way he said he made you in that story ...
if there &apos;s an entire book , it could be terrible .
i would expect nothing less .
i was mean to him on the steps of the met .
i bad @-@ mouthed him repeatedly to his dream girl .
i tried to undermine him at &quot; w. &quot;
i @-@ i &apos;m sure he &apos;s brutal .
look , he may be calling this a novel ,
but i know just how little imagination he really has .
it &apos;s a memoir masquerading as fiction
like a reverse james frey .
so you &apos;re going to read it ?
no . no .
and--and you shouldn &apos;t either .
look ... that book has nothing to do with us
and the family we &apos;re building .
whatever &apos;s in there , even if it is the truth ,
it &apos;s in the past .
now if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
this baby of yours is making me so tired , i need to lie down .
still nothing ?
the woman i met &apos;s not even in the background anywhere .
maybe she &apos;s a ghost .
well , at an upper east side event ,
we just call them first wives .
nate , can i see you for a minute ?
uh ... yeah .
sure .
i &apos;m sorry .
you know , i @-@ i can leave .
it &apos;s fine . i only need a minute . i &apos;m diana , by the way .
so i gathered .
charlie .
hey . who is that and why is she in my office ?
charlie rhodes , all right ? serena &apos;s cousin .
and she said she met a woman named ivy
at the fashion show last week .
i don &apos;t care who she is .
we can &apos;t have strangers in here going through our photos .
you should know better .
listen , she &apos;s trustworthy , i promise .
i don &apos;t care . get rid of her .
i &apos;m sorry . i ...
wasn &apos;t any more help .
if i remember anything more about her , i &apos;ll let you know .
it was really nice to meet you . i &apos;ve heard so much .
i &apos;ll see you .
bye .
thanks for letting me hang here , man .
i &apos;m rather enjoying watching you squirm . scotch ?
it &apos;s , like , 2 : 00 p.m.
valium then ?
i &apos;m guessing my dad is , uh , probably halfway through
and nate &apos;s probably still on page 20 .
i wonder if they &apos;re gonna be upset with me .
alessandra said it isn &apos;t that scathing .
and i--and i--i am-- i &apos;m harshest on myself .
i hope they can see that . come here , buddy .
stop whining .
you &apos;re not the first person
to use the world around them for inspiration .
didn &apos;t your dad get temporarily famous singing about lily ?
yeah , but my book isn &apos;t a love song , you know ?
why aren &apos;t you mad at me ?
your character dies ... accidentally ,
but it &apos;s not a-- it &apos;s not a happy ending .
on the contrary-- although clearly fiction .
i &apos;ve never use a belt .
i &apos;d use a shahtoosh scarf . much softer .
well , let &apos;s hope everyone else shares your point of view .
all success comes at a price .
the artist must stand alone to observe the crowd , right ?
it &apos;s funny . vanessa said the same thing .
hey , dad . w--
really ?
great . you &apos;re coming . all right .
uh , you know , i have another call , but--but , uh ,
but i &apos;ll see you tonight . okay ? all right .
hello ?
seems like things are looking up for lonely boy .
thank you . thank you so much .
it means a lot that you &apos;re coming .
let &apos;s hope they &apos;ve actually read the book
and not judged it by its cover .
how is it i can sleep for two hours
and still be so exhausted ?
louis , are you sitting here by yourself ?
i was just , uh , waiting for you to wake up
so i could tell you the bad news .
my family is not going to make it .
there is a terrible storm over the atlantic
that has delayed their trip .
i @-@ i &apos;ll let my mom and cyrus know .
we can tell them tomorrow when sophie and beatrice arrive .
if they make it by then .
well ... what do you want to do tonight instead ?
shall i make a reservation for gramercy tavern ?
i have some work to catch up on .
why don &apos;t you go to dan &apos;s book party ?
i &apos;m sure he &apos;d love to see you .
okay .
louis just lied to me about his family .
how you know ?
my outfit for tonight &apos;s announcement
included a pair of crocodile alaia &apos;s ,
and you can &apos;t wear such a beautiful shoe
if there &apos;s even a hint of sprinkle outside .
so of course i checked the weather .
clear from monaco to manhattan .
maybe have something to do with lonely boy book .
louis was reading while you sleep .
he did not look happy .
i told him not to read it .
it &apos;s not like there &apos;s anything in it that he doesn &apos;t know about me .
oh , my god .
i &apos;m gonna kill dan humphrey .
oh , god , the r.s.v.p.s are rolling in !
the literary world is saying &quot; yes &quot; to you .
to &quot; anonymous . &quot;
let &apos;s hope they &apos;re still interested
when they find out he &apos;s me .
they will be .
that and dying to know
who you based the characters on .
we &apos;ll want to get a photo of
you with all your friends tonight .
that way , people can play the guessing game of who &apos;s who .
you know , i don &apos;t--i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m not sure that they &apos;re gonna want to ...
to be the lead photo on &quot; new york social diary &quot; ?
they wouldn &apos;t all be coming if they didn &apos;t want to support you .
well , not everyone &apos;s coming . blair &apos;s not .
yes , she is .
she just r.s.v.p. &apos; d . it &apos;s right here .
blair waldorf , no plus @-@ one .
really ? &apos; cause she told me herself that she--
来我公寓 就现在
so , my ex in scott rudin &apos;s office called .
apparently , everyone is talking about
the book that your friend wrote and your character in it .
oh , i told him that you &apos;re sabrina .
i hope that &apos;s not a problem .
no , not at all .
it &apos;s nice to play such a big part in dan &apos;s book .
we &apos;ve always been so close .
he must &apos;ve been a saint to put with you that long .
remind me never to
start a juice fast the day we talk
to daniel day @-@ lewis .
uh , your pineapple mint &apos;s on the desk .
better . let &apos;s seal this deal .
jane bettinger &apos;s office .
serena ?
yeah . hi , nigel . it &apos;s me .
i &apos;m putting you on speaker with jane now .
daniel &apos;s manager .
we &apos;re going to need to postpone the meeting .
sorry for the short notice .
uh , hold on a minute . i need to hop on another call .
i wonder if this has anything to do
with you being in that book .
d.d.l. is notoriously anti @-@ anything sceney .
what are you talking about ?
oh , well , there &apos;s this novel going around town
with a character based on serena .
&quot; sabrina &quot; is a totally shallow ,
self @-@ obsessed party girl .
yes , uh , i finished it .
aren &apos;t you being a little reductive ?
and ridiculous .
daniel lives on a farm in ireland .
his cow &apos;s probably giving birth right now ,
and everything isn &apos;t about serena .
sorry about that . i &apos;m afraid right now
is not a a good time for daniel to be looking
at this particular project .
wait . i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry . you &apos;re--you &apos;re passing ?
sorry , sabrina .
movie business . it &apos;s all about timing . cheers .
did he just say &quot; sabrina &quot; ?
did you spend extra time doing your hair tonight , nathaniel ?
i don &apos;t mind that dan made me gay .
i know . i was actually a little offended he didn &apos;t make me gay .
personally , i thought you &apos;d be more annoyed
at being conflated with eric .
you didn &apos;t read it , did you ?
what do you mean by conflated ?
your character is two years younger than everyone else
and is best friends with the narrator &apos;s little sister frankie .
in fact , the only thing i think you share
is lacrosse and a good political pedigree .
what &apos;s my character &apos;s name again ?
derek .
what took you so long ?
i got your text , and i came right over . what &apos;s wrong ?
i can &apos;t believe you told everyone .
it was supposed to be our secret .
you &apos;re the one who wanted it kept secret , not me .
i have a life ... future ... plans ,
and ... you can &apos;t just screw this up .
i didn &apos;t mean to .
you have to understand .
there is nothing between us--
not then , not now .
nothing .
i don &apos;t believe you .
do you believe me now ?
can we dair believe ?
queen b. and lonely boy doing the deed ?
even i have to admit it &apos;s a novel idea .
dan ! what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m supposed to be here . it &apos;s my party , isn &apos;t it ?
yes , but when it &apos;s your party , you arrive late ,
and the later the better ,
especially because we want a big frenzy around the reveal
that you are &quot; anonymous . &quot;
i need to put you somewhere no one will see you .
so i &apos;m supposed to just hide in here ?
yeah , you can sign books while you wait .
and do not come out until i tell you .
okay .
i &apos;m sorry .
oh . no , no , it was me . i wasn &apos;t looking .
i &apos;m on my way to an event .
is it drinks with me ?
i wish i could say it was , but it &apos;s a family thing .
come on . what sounds more fun ?
your family ...
or a dirty martini with a stranger ?
well , a martini or two could be nice .
flighty ? irresponsible ? i &apos;m gonna kill him .
i &apos;m sorry .
yes , you are .
oh , i am so sorry nate couldn &apos;t come .
not as sorry as dan &apos;s going to be .
wonder where he is .
hi . i &apos;m alessandra , dan &apos;s agent .
you must be his dad .
it is a pleasure to meet you ,
mr. humphrey , and you , mrs. humphrey .
oh , you can call me lily .
and this is sloane cosley , the best @-@ selling author
of &quot; i was told there &apos;d be cake . &quot;
which i am still in search of ,
so if you &apos;ll excuse me .
oh , it &apos;s so nice to meet you .
where is the man of the hour ?
he &apos;s early to everything .
i &apos;m hiding him . he &apos;ll be out soon .
and you must be mr. charlie trout .
i have been dying to meet you .
care to join me for a drink ?
you know , i just saw graydon .
maybe we should go say hello .
nice meeting you .
ciao .
i was nervous you wouldn &apos;t show up ,
considering your portrayal in the book .
why would i be upset ?
i don &apos;t know . your character &apos;s story is so tragic ,
even before he dies .
and the way it happens-- all i could think was
how long you must have been hanging there
before anybody found you .
i have plenty of staff .
they would have found me immediately .
staff ? not friends or family ?
makes it even worse .
hello ?
hi . i &apos;m looking for an ivy dickens .
yeah . this is sh--
she ? i figured as much .
don &apos;t bother lying
or hanging up .
we met this morning when you were
charlie rhodes . remember me now ?
hey , do you know where dan is ?
can you believe what he wrote about me ?
which part ? sabrina is glamorous , sexy , beautiful .
selfish , insensitive , shallow .
let me tell you , from experience ,
everyone loves a villain .
yeah , i told blair the same thing ,
but then i realize if that &apos;s true ,
why are you always alone ?
not one word . have you seen dan ?
no . have you ?
did you see what he wrote about me ?
no , i didn &apos;t have time to read all of it ,
just the parts about me .
me , too .
check the study .
nate , hey , are you here ?
my agent has me locked in the study .
please tell me the party &apos;s good .
i decided not to come .
what ? why ? is everything okay ?
no , dude . it &apos;s--it &apos;s not .
what ? i thought you ...
derek ? really ?
i mean , i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m not even important enough
to merit my own character .
i &apos;m one of your best friends , dan .
at least i thought i was .
no , every writer condenses people
for better dramatic effect .
hemingway did it . uh , joseph mitchell did it .
it &apos;s , you know--
you have a lot of explaining to do , humphrey !
i am so sorry i wasn &apos;t able to stop by .
nate , i gotta call you back
&apos;cause blair and serena are here .
oh , right , because they &apos;re more important ,
which is why they got their own characters .
no , wait .
nate is ...
furious ? yeah , because i am .
and i &apos;m more furious , if that &apos;s even possible .
i could lose my job over this .
i could lose my fiance !
wait . what ? i didn &apos;t read your parts .
he wrote that we had sex !
you slept with dan ?
no , you really think i would do that ?
it &apos;s not what you think .
is this true ?
of course it &apos;s true . this is why you had me kill your story
and why you asked me not to read it .
i came here because i thought my suspicions ridiculous .
turns out the only thing ridiculous is me .
i should have known .
dan , your father and stepmother ...
oh , great . you &apos;re all here .
hi !
perfect opportunity for ... a photo !
everyone in ?
looks like the best piece of fiction is that people ...
smile .
are actually happy for dan humphrey .
&quot; inside . &quot;
is this what you &apos;ve been trying to tell me all day ?
no , because it never happened .
it never happened .
i don &apos;t believe a word you say .
you said yourself that dan has no imagination .
okay , uh , thanks , but , louis , it didn &apos;t happen .
i would never lie to you . you know that .
i never know with you ... um ...
and that &apos;s the problem .
we &apos;re gonna go check on the guests . come on , rufus .
i have no reason to stay here any longer .
you had better hope i can stop your fantasy life
from destroying my real one .
blair , i never wanted us to come between you two .
when are you gonna get it through your head ?
there &apos;s no &quot; us . &quot; there never was !
there &apos;s nothing here but friendship ,
and even that &apos;s gone now .
please tell me it is time for my entrance .
not yet , but you &apos;ll be fine here with your friend .
how did you know ?
just a hunch . but then i did my research .
quite a web you &apos;ve spun .
but what i can &apos;t quite figure out is why .
maybe the people you &apos;ve been lying to could explain it to me .
i didn &apos;t ask for any of it .
serena &apos;s aunt , carol rhodes , paid me
to impersonate her daughter charlie
so she could access her trust fund .
it worked .
and i took the money and went back to my real life ,
only serena found me and dragged me back here .
now i &apos;m trapped .
so now you can &apos;t get out .
or maybe you don &apos;t want to .
that dress suits you , as does living in a penthouse , i &apos;m sure .
i &apos;m not ... in it for the money .
maybe i was before , but now for the first time in my life ,
i feel like i actually belong somewhere .
but you don &apos;t .
and when these people realize you &apos;re not one of them ,
they &apos;re gonna destroy you .
please don &apos;t tell them .
i won &apos;t .
i &apos;m gonna protect you , if you let me .
what do you want ?
you &apos;re making a big mistake .
in thinking that blair could be trusted , yes .
she will always have her secrets .
she can &apos;t exist without them .
you were right , after all .
you should never listen to me .
if you read dan &apos;s book , you know how i turn out .
you have a chance
at having love in your life ,
not ending up alone ...
hanging in a closet .
don &apos;t give up on your own fact
over someone else &apos;s fiction .
i &apos;m sorry you &apos;re hurt .
no , not hurt . mystified .
in high school , you were the only one
who saw me for who i really was or who i wanted to be .
you helped me be somebody that i was more proud of .
i didn &apos;t know .
do you even remember the girl that you fell in love with ?
or just that she got so drunk on thanksgiving
that she got grazed by a taxi
or that she got married in barcelona
or slept with not one but two of her professors ?
i hate to break it to you , but those things ... happened .
it &apos;s not the things .
it &apos;s how you wrote about them .
that &apos;s the point . dylan hunter is a judgmental dick
who can &apos;t even look at himself in the mirror .
my character comes off the worst of all of them .
he--he puts off his writing . he misses job interviews .
he ignores his grades . why ?
because he cares more for a pretty blonde
than he does his own future , and in the end ,
none of his friends are happy for his success .
they all turn their backs on him , and he deserves it !
yeah . he does .
i need to find blair . i gotta make sure she &apos;s okay .
no , we &apos;re not done here .
i just messed up her engagement .
i could ruin her life .
yeah , and what about mine ?
if you can &apos;t tell the difference between what i did to blair
and what i did to you ,
then maybe your portrayal in the book
is more accurate than you thought .
that sounds exactly like something
dylan hunter would say .
it &apos;s time . you ready for your big moment ?
absolutely .
everyone ? everyone .
hi . i @-@ i know you &apos;re not all here to hear me speak
but to finally find out who is &quot; anonymous . &quot;
it is with great pleasure
that i introduce you to the amazingly special
and very talented author of &quot; inside ... &quot;
dan humphrey .
looks like dan humphrey &apos;s on the fast track
from lonely boy to only boy .
louis didn &apos;t return my calls all night .
i don &apos;t know if he &apos;ll ever speak to me again .
is that what you were trying to tell me yesterday ?
have you two been having trouble ?
no .
quite the contrary , in fact .
i wish i was telling you this at a better time , but ...
i &apos;m pregnant .
what ?
oh , my gosh !
blair , that &apos;s amazing !
wait . that &apos;s ... that &apos;s good news , right ?
well , i was happy . so happy .
but now what if i &apos;m in this alone ?
no , you &apos;re not alone . never .
i know i may have been busy since i got back ,
but that doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;m not here for you .
i can always count on you .
i just wish louis felt the same about me .
i do .
i &apos;m gonna get ready for work .
i love you .
let me know if you need me .
louis ...
don &apos;t . i &apos;m ashamed enough at my behavior .
i know you have a complicated past ,
but you &apos;ve been honest about it .
it &apos;s hard for me .
i want to believe , but every time i turn ,
there seems to be another secret .
that night at constance , you gave me a choice .
and now i &apos;m giving you one .
either you find a way to trust me , or you let me go .
i could never let you go .
thanks for seeing me .
of course , charles . i &apos;m so happy you called .
it &apos;s been a long time .
rufus isn &apos;t here if you need to talk .
seems like i &apos;m always off on my own .
i thought you liked it that way .
i don &apos;t want to be the unrepentant bad boy
who no one cares lives or dies .
it &apos;s just a book , charles .
what if it isn &apos;t ?
there are people that care so deeply for you
if you would just let them .
blair is lost to me .
i know .
i &apos;m sorry .
hey , how was the party ?
oh , i didn &apos;t go .
dan humphrey wasn &apos;t exactly the friend i thought he was .
mm . i &apos;m sorry to hear it .
i know how important loyalty is to you .
but i think i have something that might cheer you up .
i wanna introduce you to your new colleague .
what are you doing here ?
i ... needed a new job ,
so thank you for introducing me to diana .
why do i get the feeling that there &apos;s more to this story ?
oh , a lady never tells .
it &apos;s always better to stay mysterious .
why don &apos;t you show her around ?
sure . yeah . welcome aboard .
thank you .
come on in .
hey , dad .
your reviews ?
i guess you have a lot of reading to do today .
i don &apos;t--i don &apos;t want you to get too excited ,
but &quot; the new york post &quot; called your son
the &quot; potential voice of his generation . &quot;
and--and &quot; the new york times &quot; called the book--where is it ?
uh , yeah , &quot; a searing portrayal of manhattan &apos;s elite
with just the right portion of pathos . &quot;
i @-@ i had to double @-@ check it to make sure
they didn &apos;t say &quot; pathetic , &quot; which is what , eh ,
all my friends think i am .
is everything okay ?
well , last night was your big night .
i didn &apos;t want to ruin it for you , but ...
well , it kinda went there on its own .
what--what &apos;s going on ? did you not like the book ?
no , of course i did . you &apos;re a beautiful writer .
just ...
broke--broke my heart .
wait . dad ...
i gave up my career to raise you ,
and i never regretted it , not once ...
until yesterday when i read what you really think about me .
has @-@ been turned trophy husband who married for money .
no , that is not--that &apos;s not what i think of you .
you more than anybody should understand artistic license .
i never expected to be your hero , but ...
i just didn &apos;t think i &apos;d end up the fool .
in literature , there are thousands of endings--
some happy , some sad .
some end with a twist .
i want this book .
well ... here it is .
i want the movie rights to this book ,
and since you &apos;re good friends with the author ,
that shouldn &apos;t be a problem , right ?
we &apos;re not exactly on good terms right now .
look , your reputation reflects directly on me ,
and frankly , this book leaves yours in tatters .
so prove to me i made the right choice hiring you .
i want this book ,
and you &apos;re going to get it for me .
so whatever you did to dan humphrey ,
undo it , okay ?
you have a week .
yeah , but i don &apos;t know why it says contact here ...
some stories open the door for something more .
and then there are fairy tale endings
where the girl gets her prince .
and endings that turn you introspective
about your own life and your place in the world .
hello ?
how &apos;s my star ?
have you been reading the reviews ?
yeah , a few .
well , i have great news .
the book is now number 4 on amazon ,
and your reading today
at the union square barnes and noble
is filling up fast .
great . that--that &apos;s great .
and then there &apos;s the ending
that you saw coming a mile away
and yet somehow still takes you by surprise .
so i &apos;ll see you there at 6 : 00 . and i know . i don &apos;t have
to tell you to be on time &apos; cause you &apos;ll be early .
oh , how many tickets do you want me to put on hold
for your friends and family ?
none . it will just be me .
but don &apos;t worry , my upper east side friends .
this story isn &apos;t ending .
we &apos;re just at the start of a brand @-@ new chapter .
