ben took money from a loan shark .
if you &apos;re not good for it ,
i understand that pretty girlfriend of yours is loaded .
julie had more than one surprise for susan .
i &apos;m giving it up for adoption .
what ?
you slammed your doors in my face !
bree rejected her friends .
let go of me !
but it was orson who came to her rescue .
your friends called me .
orson hodge had always known one thing ...
bree van de kamp was the perfect woman for him .
when he was sick , she nursed him back to health .
when he was arrested ,
she promised to wait for him .
and when he suffered a terrible injury ,
she did everything he couldn &apos;t .
so now that bree was suffering ,
orson intended to care for her .
i &apos;ve found that whatever the problem ,
a cup of tea always makes things a little better .
thank you .
to think , if you hadn &apos;t been there ,
what that terrible man might &apos;ve done ...
don &apos;t think about that .
you &apos;re safe now . i &apos;m here .
you really are a good friend .
perhaps my only one .
what a thing to say .
you &apos;re still close with gabrielle ,
lynette , and susan , aren &apos;t you ?
is something wrong ?
we &apos;re estranged .
really ?
i thought the four of you were inseparable .
i know ,
but something happened a few mont ago , and ...
bree ?
i can &apos;t talk about it .
after everything we &apos;ve been through ,
i promise you can trust me .
i don &apos;t want you to know .
you &apos;re the only one who still believes in me .
and i always will .
please , i can see this is tearing you up .
for your own good , tell me .
about six months ago ...
we threw a dinner party
but before the guests arrived at gaby &apos;s ,
something terrible happened .
orson , i understand you &apos;re shocked ,
but please talk to me .
i am shocked .
you agree to help cover up carlos &apos; crime ,
and then they just abandon you ?
how can your friends do that ?
you &apos;re angry at them ?
yes .
they took advantage of you and then hung you out to dry .
it &apos;s appalling .
so even after hearing what i &apos;ve done ,
you still believe in me ?
yes , orson hodge knew that bree was the perfect woman for him .
and now that he had her back ...
i believe in you more than ever .
he had no intention of letting her go .
lynette scavo had discovered
the silver lining of separation--
shared custody .
for three glorious days a week ,
she had no child demanding her attention ...
no one to set an example for ...
and plenty of time to exercise .
but lynette forgot that when it comes to being a mother ,
you can run ...
hey , mom !
but you can never hide .
hey , guys . what &apos;s going on ?
nothing . jeez , do we need a reason to bring flowers
to the woman who gave us life ?
suitcases ? why are there suitcases ?
okay , we had a little disagreement with our landlord ,
and we were kind of evicted .
no ! no ! no ! no ! no !
go away ! you are not moving back here .
mom , come on--
i spent 18 years getting you out of here .
there &apos;s no damn way i &apos;m letting you back in .
okay , mom .
we understand .
yeah , we have to learn to live on our own .
no .
come on ! just for a week .
i know you guys . a week would turn into a year ,
a year into 20,
and pretty soon , you &apos;re taking me off the respirator ,
saying &quot; it &apos;s what mom would &apos;ve wanted . &quot;
please let us in . we &apos;re children of divorce .
exactly . go to your dad &apos;s .
but we like you so much more .
don &apos;t give me that .
no , seriously , dad has that stupid girlfriend .
and he &apos;s been so unfair to you .
you had me at &quot; stupid girlfriend . &quot;
hey , sweetie . whatcha doing ?
oh , the adoption agency sent me a few more couples to check out .
okay , that guy &apos;s got serial killer eyes .
oh , he does not . that &apos;s from the flash .
fine . you want your baby to be on the run .
any other choices ?
i like them .
oh , gay couple .
uh , that &apos;s not a man .
oh , too bad . they &apos;re great with kids .
okay , that &apos;s it . nobody &apos;s ever gonna be good enough for you .
so you &apos;ve totally ruled out keeping it ?
yes , totally .
and i get no say in the matter ?
now you &apos;re talkin &apos; .
you need to stop hassling her .
i just wish there was something i could do
to keep her from giving this baby away .
hey , what if i talk to the father ?
susan
no , does he even know that she &apos;s doing this ?
maybe if i find him ,
i tell him , and then he &apos;ll stop her .
that &apos;s a very bad idea .
says you .
what do your friends think ?
i don &apos;t know . not allowed to tell them .
julie wants to keep this a big secret .
so you are the only one i &apos;m allowed to talk to ,
and i would really appreciate it if you would agree with me .
look , this is killing me , too .
but it &apos;s her decision .
you keep pushing her ,
it &apos;s not just a grandkid you &apos;re gonna lose .
girls , let &apos;s go home now .
all right , i &apos;m gonna count to three .
one ...
two ...
two and a half ...
two and three @-@ quarters ...
you don &apos;t know any more fractions , do you ?
all right , that is it , smart @-@ ass .
i am calling your father .
and you better watch out ,
because this phone has a whup @-@ ass app .
hi , sweetie . i am just getting ready to meditate .
can i call you back ?
no ! no , no , no . enough nurturing your inner child .
i need you to come home
and whack a couple of your outer ones .
i can &apos;t come home until my treatment is complete .
that &apos;s another 16 days .
in 16 days , i can &apos;t guarantee
you &apos;re gonna have children to come home to .
you wouldn &apos;t believe the things that are going through my mind .
gaby .
i &apos;m just saying , i &apos;ve got rocks ,
they &apos;ve got backpacks ,
and there &apos;s a lake on the way to school .
look ... i know that it has been tough on you
with me being in rehab .
you have no idea . i am losing my mind .
i &apos;m looking after your business ,
i &apos;m running the house ,
i &apos;m trying to keep the girls in line .
let me talk to juanita .
juanita , talk to your father .
hey , daddy .
anything biting ?
karen kicked me out .
oh , my god . what happened ?
i don &apos;t know .
seems like everything i do lately gets her mad .
&quot; lately &quot; ? she &apos;s a grouchy old lady .
that &apos;s why we love and fear her .
nah , this is different .
i think it &apos;s gonna take a while for her to cool down .
and in the meantime , i got no place to go .
yeah . well , you know , it &apos;s fun
to stay at the y.m.c.a.
not for me .
i slept there once .
woke up at 2 : 00 in the morning
with a guy massaging my feet .
well , at least she gave me my fishing pole
so i won &apos;t starve to death .
the church has a koi pond , right ?
there &apos;s that frontier spirit .
okay , gaby . it &apos;s obvious you &apos;re not picking up my hints .
no , i am . i &apos;m just ignoring them .
look , i &apos;d offer you a room at my place ,
but my kids are young and loud--
and i &apos;m old and deaf . it &apos;s perfect .
thanks , gaby .
i &apos;d ask bree if i could crash with her ,
but she &apos;s got orson over there .
you need to be helping your mother out more .
you know , helping around the house
thanks , honey . you &apos;ve been a big help .
i gotta call the girls . bye .
gaby !
ladies .
i saw you through the window
and just had to come out to say hello .
orson .
you &apos;re back .
i am back .
keenly observed , susan .
she just meant it &apos;s unexpected ,
seeing you after all this time .
building a ramp .
you and bree--
gonna be spending more time together ? yes .
as you know , she &apos;s been going through a rough patch of late .
the other night , she was at a bar ,
and there was an incident .
an incident ?
something unpleasant with an aggressive stranger .
she &apos;s fine .
thank god i happened to be driving by .
thank god is right .
but as you can imagine , she &apos;s still a little shaken up ,
so i &apos;m gonna be spending some time here
until the dust settles .
can we see her ?
you know , i don &apos;t think she &apos;s up for that yet .
well , i &apos;m not surprised .
yeah , last time we saw her ,
it didn &apos;t go so well .
will you at least tell her we love her and we &apos;re here for her ?
i &apos;ll be sure to relay the message .
thanks .
bye .
who were you , uh , talking to ?
just the men installing my ramp .
now how about i make us some lunch ?
no , you &apos;ve gotta deliver that cement tomorrow .
but , i don &apos;t know why ben didn &apos;t pay you ,
but i drove back to the site .
i &apos;m gonna find your check , and i &apos;ll get it to you tonight .
hey , this is private property !
what the hell ? !
damn it , mike . why &apos;d you have to come back ?
are you out of your mind ?
this doesn &apos;t concern you .
you almost killed me , so i say it does .
i &apos;m in over my head with this loan shark ,
and his late fee comes with a crowbar .
so ... some of this equipment blows up ,
the insurance company writes me a big check ,
and i &apos;m able to keep my knees a little longer .
that &apos;s fraud , ben .
i know what it &apos;s called . i just didn &apos;t know what else to do .
well , not this .
then what ? &apos; cause i &apos;ve been trying
to fix this for weeks , mike , but it just keeps getting worse .
i &apos;ve lost every cent i have .
i &apos;ve lost renee .
i &apos;ve ... i &apos;ve screwed everything up .
are you okay ?
my chest feels tight . that &apos;s not good , is it ?
no , it &apos;s not .
let &apos;s get you to the hospital . come on .
thanks .
i see the twins are home .
really ? what gave it away ?
guys ! get your boxers off the table !
they &apos;re not mine .
me neither . i &apos;m wearing ...
oh , wait .
be right down .
i swear , they &apos;re like termites .
just when i think i &apos;ve gotten rid of &apos; em ...
at least they come back to you when they &apos;re in trouble .
and that &apos;s a good thing ?
yes .
because they listen to you .
they let you help them .
they don &apos;t keep their problems secret for six months
and then completely shut you out ,
ignoring all your advice .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i &apos;m not supposed to tell you ...
that julie &apos;s pregnant ,
and she &apos;s giving the baby up for adoption .
wow . where &apos;s the dad in all this ?
&quot; who &apos;s the dad ? &quot; is more like it .
she won &apos;t tell me anything .
i &apos;m sorry .
you know , right when julie was born ,
they took her away to give her a vitamin shot ,
and that was the longest hour of my life .
and now she &apos;s talking about
giving the baby away for good .
i mean , she just has no idea how hard that &apos;s gonna be .
do you want me to talk to her ?
she might react differently to someone who &apos;s not her mom .
no .
in fact , you can &apos;t even tell her i told you .
julie doesn &apos;t want anyone knowing she &apos;s pregnant .
oh , mornin &apos; . how &apos;d you sleep ?
terribly . i &apos;d ask you , but i already know .
how can someone use the bathroom
five times in one night ?
heart of a lion ,
bladder of a fruit fly .
you do know they make bathrobes with belts on them ?
i &apos;m sorry .
i didn &apos;t mean to let the old komodo dragon
peek out of the cage .
don &apos;t mention it ... ever again .
girls , school starts in 20 minutes .
why aren &apos;t you dressed ?
&apos;cause then we &apos;d be ready ,
then we &apos;d have to go , and we hate school .
here . i made breakfast .
ooh . toast .
let me know when your cookbook comes out .
okay .
let &apos;s talk about how we &apos;re getting you off my couch
and back with the lady you love .
what &apos;s our plan ?
doesn &apos;t look good . i &apos;ve been calling all morning .
she doesn &apos;t even pick up the phone .
roy , you &apos;ve got to put some effort into it .
woo her . march over there and sweep her off her feet .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s gonna work .
no , no , here &apos;s what doesn &apos;t work--
me being awakened at 2 : 00 a.m. by that pep talk
you give your dragon when you &apos;re trying to pee .
oh ... you want me out .
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s just , my life &apos;s really stressful right now .
no apologies .
it was very kind of you to take me in .
i &apos;m sure i can find another place to stay .
oh , you &apos;ve got to be kidding me . i told you to get dressed !
i don &apos;t wanna .
damn it , girls ! listen to your mother .
you can &apos;t talk to me like that . you &apos;re not my dad .
exactly . so i don &apos;t give a crap if you live or die .
here . you see the notches on this belt ?
those are all the men i killed in korea .
first time , it was a little rough ,
but after that , you develop a taste for blood .
so listen up , soldiers .
you are gonna march up those stairs ,
put on your school gear , and be back down by 8 : 00 sharp .
is that clear ?
all right . now move !
well , i guess i better go start packing .
no ! no , no , no , no .
i can &apos;t send a war veteran out on the treet .
as long as america is free , you have a place here .
let me finish .
see , this is why i didn &apos;t tell you .
i knew you were gonna freak .
because it &apos;s not your decision .
i don &apos;t care if you &apos;re the father .
okay , you know what ? i &apos;m not doing this on the phone .
just meet me at the coffee cup in half an hour .
you using this chair ?
uh , no , go ahead .
mrs. delfino ?
oh , porter . shh .
i don &apos;t want to julie to know i &apos;m here .
why not ?
oh , she &apos;s meeting a guy .
i need to find out who it is .
oh , hey , porter . over here .
mom ?
oh , my god .
you &apos;re the guy .
porter scavo is the father of my grandchild .
i can &apos;t believe you spied on me .
and i can &apos;t believe you shacked up
with a kid you used to babysit .
can i just say something ?
are you two in a relationship ?
oh , god , no . never in a million years .
i can hear you !
we ran into each other at a bar , okay ?
and i @-@ i &apos;d just broken up with will ,
and i was feeling really depressed ,
and porter bought me a few drinks .
and then we went back to my place and--
apparently , forgot everything i taught you about condoms .
no .
it broke .
what &apos;d you expect ? it &apos;s porter scavo .
he probably found it on the floor of a movie theater .
great .
well , you better get used to it .
this snot @-@ nosed kid ,
the boy who got his head stuck in our fence ,
is the father of your baby .
no , the father will be an adoptive parent
who has gone through extensive interviews
and a background check .
both of you , stop .
no more fighting . all this stress is bad for my baby .
your baby ?
yeah . i wanna keep it .
you do ?
yeah .
oh , i was just doing some research online .
you might want to eat something called folic acid ,
or the baby could have a weird head .
you can &apos;t be serious .
there is no way we are raising a baby together .
then i &apos;ll do it myself .
oh , please . you can &apos;t do that .
well , uh , legally ...
he can .
i mean , fathers do have rights .
mom , what are you doing ?
nothing . i &apos;m just reminding porter
that he does have a say in this
and letting him know that if he wants to raise the baby ,
he &apos;ll have my support
and unlimited babysitting .
no ! no , no , no . this is none of your business .
stay out of it !
porter , if you &apos;re serious about this , i will help you .
just tell me what you need .
thank you .
could you tell my mom ?
i brought those contracts . your secretary says
to sign them so i can bring &apos; em back tomorrow .
aw . thanks , babe .
listen , i want you to understand
i get how much you &apos;ve had to do with me in here .
but i talked to my counselor ,
and he said that i don &apos;t have to do the full 16 days .
i can get out a few days early , help out with the girls .
oh , honey , you don &apos;t worry about that .
really ?
because yesterday on the phone ,
you had that whole drowning fantasy .
i know , but i got help at home .
what , a nanny ?
better . a sergeant .
i got roy .
mccluskey kicked him out , so i took him in .
you wouldn &apos;t believe how he &apos;s getting the girls in line .
mccluskey kicked him out ? why ?
who knows ?
by the way , big oil stain in the garage ?
he had the girls in there all afternoon .
it &apos;s gone !
wow . those two seemed so perfect for each other .
and it &apos;s perfect for me !
roy &apos;s a genius .
simply by yelling at the girls
and threatening &apos; em with violence ,
he has made our home a happy place .
but aren &apos;t you the least bit interested
in what drove them apart ?
i know what &apos;s gonna drive us apart--
if you keep asking those kinds of queions !
hey , i , uh , i need to talk to you about ben .
after what he did to me , i don &apos;t care .
he &apos;s in the hospital .
he is ?
what happened ?
i went to the site last night .
he started having chest pains .
they say it &apos;s not a heart attack ,
but they want to monitor him for a couple days .
but ben &apos;s a young guy . he &apos;s healthy .
why is he having chest pains ?
oh , he &apos;s been under a lot of stress .
oh , is it the money thing ?
yeah . it &apos;s worse than you think .
he &apos;s in pretty deep to this ... guy .
guy ? what kind of guy ?
let &apos;s just say he &apos;s not exactly a licensed banker ,
which is what i wanted to talk to you about .
ben &apos;s in trouble .
this is nice .
it &apos;s like you never left ,
like all of those terrible things
i told you about never happened ,
and we &apos;ve been here in this kitchen ,
safe .
it does feel very comfortable .
we &apos;re like a pair of old jeans .
well , we can only assume , since neither one of us
has ever owned a pair of old jeans .
i want to run something by you .
of course .
given everything you &apos;ve been through lately ,
how would you feel about a change of scenery ?
how big of a change ?
maine .
my aunt recently passed .
ah , no need for sympathy . she was a wretched woman .
she left her coastal cabin to me .
well , it might be nice to get away for a couple weeks .
yes . and if you like it ,
maybe we could make it more permanent ,
you know , move there .
are you talking about us getting back together ?
because i &apos;m not sure i &apos;m ready for that .
all i &apos;m talking about is a fresh start ,
a new chapter in your life .
i don &apos;t know , orson . it &apos;s such a massive change .
i &apos;d be saying good @-@ bye to all my friends .
you mean the women who involved you in a murder cover @-@ up
and then abandoned you ?
well , in all fairness ,
they did attempt
that intervention i told you about .
and yet they haven &apos;t come by since , have they ?
come on .
come to the cabin .
just for a few weeks , to see if you like it .
you know what ? let &apos;s do it .
wonderful .
i &apos;ll book the flight .
how &apos;s the sauce ?
it &apos;s all coming together perfectly .
what was that for ?
for giving me the day off .
i was able to hit the entire left side of the mall .
and if you &apos;re willing to keep torturing my kids ,
tomorrow i &apos;ll hit the right side .
hi , mom .
what &apos;s all this ?
the girls and i tackled that dead tree out back .
i taught them some basic forestry procedure .
the older one is pretty good with an ax .
you might want to keep an eye on that .
well , i can &apos;t thank you enough .
you are absolutely welcome to stay here ...
for the next 16 days .
yeah , well , i don &apos;t know if i &apos;m gonna make it that long .
i &apos;m thinking about begging karen to take me back .
what ?
i really miss her .
no , you don &apos;t .
i mean , what &apos;s there to miss ?
you know , the foul moods and the nagging
and the ...
yeah , she can be a little gruff .
and god knows i got my own baggage .
but today , when i was telling the girls
we could have a cozy fire tonight ,
all i could think about was having one with karen .
well ... i ...
i ... think you just need to get your mind off her .
you know what would help ?
a nice , long bath .
yeah . come on .
come on . you can , uh , use my lavender bath salts .
oh , i do like lavender .
that reminds me of a funny story .
hilarious .
okay , into the bath . chop chop .
karen ! is that for me ? how thoughtful .
no , it &apos;s for roy , kind of a peace offering .
no . i mean , don &apos;t back down .
i &apos;ve only lived with the guy for one day ,
and i can tell he &apos;s a handful .
well , the truth is , i &apos;m the handful ,
and i really need to talk to him .
i have to clear the air about a few things .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s gonna work .
why not ? is he still angry ?
livid .
yeah , he took an ax to a tree in my backyard .
he just kept hacking at it
and muttering &quot; take that , karen ! &quot; under his breath .
really ?
yeah , you should go and look . nothing left but a stump .
okay .
you know what ? don &apos;t worry . you let me work on him .
i bet you he &apos;ll come around in ,
i don &apos;t know , 16 days .
well , can you give this to him anyhow ?
it &apos;s french apple . it &apos;s his favorite .
i will make sure he gets it .
yeah .
make this disappear .
if you insist .
you okay ?
they say they want to run more tests , but i &apos;m fine .
well , you look like crap .
thanks . so other than boosting my spirits ,
uh , what are you here for ?
mike told me you borrowed money from a loan shark .
mike should learn to keep his mouth shut .
look , i don &apos;t want you reading anytng into this .
i just don &apos;t want to see you dead ,
from that guy or stress .
so how much do you need ?
from you ? not a cent .
ben , don &apos;t be stupid .
you &apos;re in trouble . i can help you .
you want to help me ?
wait till i get myself out of this mess ,
then let me come back to you
and apologize to you for what i did ,
then allow me to propose to you again ...
this time as the kind of man you deserve .
i mean it . i &apos;m still crazy about you .
that &apos;s terrific .
but if you don &apos;t pay those thugs what you owe them ,
they &apos;re gonna disassemble you .
and if we &apos;re getting back together ,
i want the whole package ,
not just parts .
well , don &apos;t worry about me . i can take care of myself .
yeah .
you &apos;re doing a hell of a job .
is there a better way to wake up from a nap
then to the smell of fresh @-@ baked croissants ?
the question is rhetorical ,
but the answer is still no .
i &apos;ve left some for you .
these are for the girls .
the girls ?
yes . i &apos;ve been doing some thinking ,
and it &apos;s time for reconciliation .
what a good heart you have , my dear .
but you also have a good head ,
and maybe you should give this a second thought .
no , i &apos;ve given it a lot of thought ,
and there &apos;s blame enough for all four of us in what happened .
beside if you think about it , they actually help save me .
how ?
by calling you .
you told me so yourself that night outside the bar .
and if they hadn &apos;t ,
who knows what might have happened to me ?
well , i @-@ i suppose one could make that argument , but--
but nothing . i am gonna thank them
for bringing you back into my life
and tell them about our trip together .
and besides ,
it &apos;s time one of us made the first move .
they already did .
i &apos;m sorry ?
they came by the other day when i was outside
checking the ramp .
i didn &apos;t tell you because ...
it was an unkind visit .
what are you talking about ?
at first , i thought they were here
to apologize for how they treated you .
but then the comments started--
how you &quot; deserve &quot; what happened
and how they regret calling me
because now i was &quot; stuck &quot; with you .
they said those things ?
and more .
worse .
i swore i wasn &apos;t gonna tell you , bree ,
but i couldn &apos;t let you humiliate yourself
by extending kindness to people so undeserving of it .
no , i &apos;m glad you didn &apos;t hide it from me .
you &apos;re always trying to protect me , aren &apos;t you ?
lynette , oh , i &apos;m so glad you could come over .
oh , you said you wanted to talk . what &apos;s going on ?
come sit down .
put your feet up .
have a cookie .
okay .
look at us ,
beings friends ...
eating cookies .
can you imagine us being even closer than we are right now ?
um ... i think we &apos;re pretty close already .
i &apos;m just saying ,
wouldn &apos;t it be great if we were family ?
okay , susan , if you need a ride to the airport--
no , not that .
i just want to share some amazing news ...
about our children .
no !
no ! no ! no ! he can &apos;t be having a baby !
here ! honey , breathe into this !
okay . it &apos;s gonna be okay .
julie &apos;s gonna give the baby up for adoption .
i don &apos;t know why people do this .
uh , actually , in a very mature move ,
porter says he wants to keep the baby .
what ?
yeah . he wants to raise it himself .
he can &apos;t raise a baby !
he can &apos;t even take care of himself .
all he eats are frozen waffles-- still frozen !
okay , you just need to calm down .
no , what i need is--is a time machine
to go back there
so i can slap some sense into that idiot .
in fact , i &apos;m gonna do the slapping part right now .
no , no , no , no . you-- you can &apos;t be mad at porter .
i mean , you should &apos;ve heard the way
he was talking about the baby . he &apos;s so excited .
yeah , and he &apos;ll stay excited for about a week ,
just like he did with the puppy we gave him in fifth grade .
know what happened to that puppy ?
no .
no one does .
and--and what was julie thinking ?
julie ?
yeah , she should have some sense . she &apos;s getting a phd .
my kid eats waffsicles .
you &apos;re missing the point here .
your son ...
yeah .
and my daughter--they made this sweet little baby together ,
and we could help raise it .
oh . i ... i already have a sweet little baby ,
who is only months away from day care .
i am not going right back to the beginning .
i see .
you &apos;re afraid of being inconvenienced ,
so you want to give the baby away to strangers .
no .
i want to give that baby away
to people who are ready to be parents .
it &apos;s better for porter , it &apos;s better for julie ,
and it &apos;s sure as hell better for that baby .
look at what i &apos;m doing .
pay attention to me . tell me i &apos;m great .
what is happening ?
i &apos;m thirsty . i want a glass of water now !
water ! water ! water !
oh . you &apos;re a baby . i get it .
no , porter , you don &apos;t get it .
when this baby comes , it &apos;s gonna want food and clothes
and a home to live in ,
because babies are selfish that way .
i think i can handle it .
are you serious ?
you &apos;ve never been able to commit to anything .
maybe if julie was giving birth to a video game
or a new porn site ,
but there is no way in hell you are ready for this !
can i talk now ?
yes , go ahead , but if i happen
to roll my eyes and snort ,
just know i was provoked .
everything you said is true .
i @-@ i &apos;m not ready for this .
i have $ 17 in my checking account
and no clue how to write a resume .
yeah , a couple days ago , that didn &apos;t bother me ,
but now it &apos;s all i can think about .
well , you &apos;re gonna have to do more than think .
i will . i &apos;ll get a job . i &apos;ll take--i &apos;ll take classes .
i &apos;ll do whatever it takes .
okay .
okay , that &apos;s great , but ...
when you are a parent ,
there is so much you are gonna have to give up .
your whole life just ...
it is gonna change forever .
it already has .
she &apos;s not even born yet , and i can &apos;t believe
how much i &apos;m dying to ... see her .
mom ...
i love her .
i really , really love her .
i hope you &apos;re happy , porter hired a lawyer .
he wants to raise the baby .
hey , is that such a terrible thing ?
i mean , he &apos;s not gonna be doing it on his own . i &apos;ll help .
you think that makes it better ?
now when i come home , i &apos;ll have to see her .
do you have any idea how painful that &apos;s gonna be ?
i just ...
want to forget this ever happened .
julie , it &apos;s your daughter .
you &apos;re never gonna forget .
you don &apos;t know that .
yes , i do ,
because i &apos;ve had a daughter .
you can &apos;t possibly understand this until you have one , too ,
but every single day that you &apos;re not with me ,
i think about you .
i wonder what you &apos;re doing ,
i worry if you &apos;re safe ,
and i hope you are happy .
no !
this was my decision to make ,
and you took it away .
i can &apos;t forgive you for that .
oh , there you are . i can &apos;t get celia to take a bath .
do you still have that dummy grenade ?
you okay ?
i just didn &apos;t think was gonna end like this .
after all these years ,
i thought i &apos;d finally found the one .
oh , it &apos;s just a rough patch .
you two will come out of this stronger than ever .
i don &apos;t know about that .
at my age , falling in love
is not about all that drama you young people go through .
it &apos;s about finding the one who &apos;ll be there ,
holding your hands , at the end .
i thought ...
karen would be that person for me .
but i @-@ i guess i was wrong .
so we got your m.r.i. back ,
and i &apos;m afraid the results are not what we &apos;d hoped for .
the cancer is back .
it &apos;s metastasized to the brain .
so the drugs have stopped working , huh ?
i &apos;m afraid so .
but we &apos;ll start you
on an aggressive course of radiation right away ,
and there are new therapies we can try .
thanks for giving it to me straight .
karen ...
we &apos;ve been through this before ,
and you are a fighter ,
but this is gonna be tough .
you &apos;re gonna need a lot of support from roy .
actually , uh , roy &apos;s out of the picture .
he and i split .
oh , i &apos;m sorry to hear that .
i &apos;m not .
he had to watch his first wife get sick and die .
he doesn &apos;t need to go through that again .
trust me .
this is for the best .
if you don &apos;t mind ,
i &apos;d like to just pay the entire bill today
and close out this account .
and , uh , i assume you &apos;ll honor our agreement
to keep this just between you and me .
yeah , sure .
you have a lovely home .
i can tell you like the finer things .
you were married to that yankee , right ?
i heard he cheated on you .
man , you must have cleaned up in that divorce .
it always amazes me how much power
is in this little piece of paper .
i mean , with it , all your problems disappear .
without it ,
your aussie friend ...
he ends up begging one of my guys
not to shoot him in the kneecap .
uh , you ... have your money .
are we done ?
sure , we &apos;re done .
normally , i &apos;d never take a check
but you seem like a classy lady ,
and i know where you live .
i remember this .
i bought it for you in milan .
cashmere .
it &apos;s one of my favorites .
much too fussy for where we &apos;re going .
you want to stick with more comfortable , casual things , bree .
is everything okay ?
yes . it &apos;s just that i don &apos;t think
i &apos;ve ever seen you this confident .
well , i &apos;m not the same man i was two years ago .
i &apos;ve let go of a lot ,
changed my life completely .
how did you do that ?
well , it started when i learned to drive again .
really ?
mm .
i know it sounds strange ,
but for me , in my condition ,
that freedom changed everything .
driving was a way
for me to move forward with my life ,
to let go of the past .
being on the road gave me a new perspective .
i started to see the silver lining
in even the worst situations .
i learned to be calmer ,
more patient .
i even began spending more time in nature .
and i started reaching out to old friends .
it took time ,
but little by little , i became a new man .
what an inspiring story .
perhaps when we &apos;re in maine ,
you can help me start the process of changing my life .
oh , bree , don &apos;t you see ?
the process has already started for you .
i suppose it has .
trust me , darling .
