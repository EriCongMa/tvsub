he won &apos;t find you -- reddington --
if that &apos;s what you &apos;re hoping for or worried about .
tom &apos;s alive . you don &apos;t have agnes .
i &apos;m not worried about anything .
i won &apos;t apologize for trying to restore my family .
even if it means destroying mine .
reddington -- he took you from me .
and you hate him for it ,
for stealing your child .
i know how that feels .
you would &apos;ve been with agnes now if you hadn &apos;t tried to escape .
yes .
but then again , so would you .
tell me .
i got the girl .
find a way across the straits ,
then contact my office in the keys . do it quickly .
agnes has been away from her mother too long .
she &apos;s gonna kill us !

the child ...
no .
liz and agnes .
no .
please assist mr. kaplan .
you all right ?
where are they ?
in danger . how did you find us ?
i had aram tracking that car .
i spent the better part of the day stuck in the trunk .
who was the driver ?
had to be one of kirk &apos;s hired hands .
6 @-@ foot , rough trade , dark skin .
likes western wear .
mato . i saw his face .
who &apos;s mato ?
a finder . a tracker . killer when necessary .
how do we find him ?
i don &apos;t know .
you don &apos;t know or you won &apos;t say ?
we had a mutual friend .
he gave mato his start as a skip tracer .
it was years ago .
little nikos .
i can talk to him .
if he knows anything , he &apos;ll tell me .
west texas &apos; favorite bail bondsman .
an amarillo institution for 25 years to life .
dembe , call edward . tell him to ready the jet .
we &apos;re gonna pay a visit to little nikos .
excuse me . sorry .
it &apos;s mr. reddington .
we have two targets --
elizabeth keen and agnes keen --
traveling separate paths to an unknown location .
constantin rostov , also know as alexander kirk ,
fled with elizabeth in a private seaplane
that departed from playa larga ...
less than an hour ago , due west .
what about agnes ?
i have a lead on agnes .
she was abducted by one of kirk &apos;s private contractors ,
a high @-@ priced tracker known only as mato .
he missed the flight off the island .
then he &apos;s trapped in cuba .
there &apos;s no way he &apos;ll make it past the pnr
after the international incident you just caused there .
ordinarily i would agree with you , agent navabi ,
but mato isn &apos;t your garden @-@ variety mercenary .
from what i &apos;m told , he &apos;s an indian --
part sioux , part i don &apos;t know what ,
son of a shaman .
mato could sneak up on a deer in a glade
and smack it on the rump .
he &apos;ll find his way off the island .
we &apos;ll notify the seaports just in case .
good luck . and let us know what you turn up .
contact customs and border patrol .
they work with the coast guard
to monitor the air and waters around cuba .
sir , i don &apos;t understand why we &apos;re going to such extremes --
agent ressler is on a return flight from cuba .
it &apos;s time to set aside your personal feelings
and help out this investigation .
this is my fault .
if anything happens to elizabeth or the baby ...
you have nothing to apologize for .
you tried to help us find a normal life .
i &apos;d take that risk again .
i don &apos;t regret trying to get away from you .
of course you don &apos;t .
regret requires age or wisdom .
we were trying to protect agnes .
i guess that didn &apos;t work out .
when we get to amarillo ,
i think it would be best to do as i say , both of you .
mayday , mayday , mayday .
plane down off the coast of havana .
23 degrees ,
52 minutes north .
82 degrees , 49 minutes south .
mayday , mayday , mayday .
can anyone hear me ?
my sat phone .
gone .
you need to untie me , masha .
mayday , mayday , mayday , is anyone there ?
what was that ?
you need to know that agnes is safe .
she &apos;ll be cared for .
you see anything ?
one of the pontoons is taking on water .
we don &apos;t have long .
untie me !
masha , i &apos;m your father . you can &apos;t let me drown .
watch me .
we &apos;ve got every sonar operator in the miami district
working on this .
we launched the search as soon as i received your call .
any chance the plane is still in range ?
a light aircraft , flying low and slow ? we &apos;ll find it .
we monitor 2 million square miles of ocean from miami .
welcome back , agent ressler . this is captain daly .
he &apos;s our liaison with the u.s. coast guard .
i &apos;m authorized to give you full access to our radar screens .
if that seaplane is flying low , won &apos;t it avoid detection ?
most radar transmitters are on the ground , aimed at the sky .
ours float in the sky on balloons , looking down .
they &apos;re designed to detect small aircraft ,
like the one you described .
if you don &apos;t mind me asking , who &apos;s on the plane ?
friend .
a fugitive .
sounds complicated .
when we get inside , let me talk to him .
he and i have history .
he and i don &apos;t . i &apos;ll be more persuasive .
is that what this has come to ?
the chance for you to punish me by hurting someone i care about ?
you are not my concern . agnes is .
if someone you care about is hurt
in the process of finding her , so be it .
do you remember what i looked like that night ?
lying in the street , my head torn open ...
annie &apos;s body in front of me .
you know i don &apos;t know what you looked like . i was away .
right , but he does .
little nikos sat by my bed in the hospital .
when i healed , he gave me work , a reason to push on .
he &apos;s a decent man .
i &apos;m only here to serve you today because of his kindness .
you may speak to him first .
briefly .
afternoon . can i help you ?
little nikos , please .
oh , wish i could oblige , miss ...
mr. kaplan , an old friend .
mr. kaplan , i wish i could oblige ,
but nikos is takin &apos; a little nap .
perhaps it &apos;s time for a wake @-@ up call .
uh , i &apos;m afraid that &apos;s not possible . he &apos;s in surgery .
where ?
his stomach .
and where might we find his stomach ?
i told him he couldn &apos;t come in .
oh , my . me and my timing .
what the hell is going on ?
is this a lap band ?
i knew all those desserts would catch up
with little nikos one day .
i think i see some baklava in there .
put that down . helen , get him out of here .
call building security .
i need your capable team here to wake up your patient .
what ? call security right now .
wake him up .
i can &apos;t . we &apos;re in the middle of a procedure .
i &apos;d be putting his life in danger .
his life &apos;s already in danger . how &apos; bout yours ?
there are no life vests , no inflatable rafts .
we &apos;re gonna flip .
our only chance is out there , holding onto the pontoons .
you mean my only chance .
you &apos;re not going anywhere .
we &apos;re not gonna survive unless we trust each other .
i &apos;ll never trust you .
we &apos;re a family . not reddington . us .
if you wanna hold your child in your arms again ,
we need to trust each other .
the coast guard just picked up a brief elt signal
from a light aircraft west of havana ,
somewhere in the gulf of mexico .
an elt signal ? are you telling me their plane went down ?
it appears that way , sir .
but we have a location for them .
it &apos;s not that simple .
this elt signal &apos;s an older model . analog frequency .
no digital signal to carry gps coordinates .
elts are notoriously unreliable , especially if they &apos;re ...
submerged underwater .
we &apos;ve narrowed the search field to 220 square miles .
sar teams are gearing up now .
i know this is not about me , it is about agent keen ,
but i don &apos;t know if i have the strength to lose her again .
none of us do .
stay on it . say a prayer .
and notify me the minute you have an update .
he &apos;s awake - and in excruciating pain .
i gave him a self @-@ administering morphine drip
to manage his discomfort .
even that won &apos;t be enough
unless you get what you want quickly and leave .
remember ...
we &apos;re getting what we need , one way or another .
kate . what are you ...
what &apos;s happening ?
we only have a minute . raymond reddington is here .
he wants mato .
tell me how to find mato .
no .
he &apos;ll kill you if you don &apos;t .
he &apos;ll kill mato if i do .
i &apos;m not gonna hurt you , nikos .
you &apos;re a good man . loyal .
protective of those who are protective of you .
i admire that in a person .
unfortunately for you , i &apos;m surrounded by people who don &apos;t .
tom , i &apos;d like to introduce you to little nikos ,
the man who &apos;s protecting the sociopath who stole your baby .
good luck with that surgery , nick .
don &apos;t let go .
no matter what , don &apos;t let go .
they &apos;re looking .
the fbi , the coast guard .
they &apos;ll find us .
they &apos;ll find you ... -
... which is enough .
no . no !
i told you not to let go .
i can help you .
it &apos;s too much .
you said we have to trust each other .
do you trust me ?
yes .
then hold on .
they will find us .
they will find us .
here &apos;s my little girl .
that &apos;s agnes .
i &apos;m gonna put this right ...
here ,
because she is the reason i am doing this . remember that .
i &apos;ll just take this .
that &apos;s enough , yeah .
tell me how to find mato .
i ... i can &apos;t do that .
well , you do have guts .
what do you think this does ?
i &apos;m sorry it had to be nikos .
if there &apos;s no sincerity behind your words ,
don &apos;t waste them .
what would you have me say , kate ?
say that you understand .
i didn &apos;t just give you my friend as an act of contrition .
i &apos;m not sorry for what i did .
i betrayed you for the same reason i just betrayed nikos --
to keep elizabeth safe ,
just like you asked me to all those years ago ,
when you first put her in my arms as a baby girl ,
only now she has a baby girl of her own ,
and your existence in their lives
puts them in constant danger .
say that you understand or don &apos;t say anything at all .
hey , stay awake .
stay with me . talk to me .
tell me , uh , about your parents .
what were their names ?
help !
over here ! help !
i got a phone number and a password .
nakaidoklini ?
it &apos;s a famous medicine man . i don &apos;t know .
you text that name to that number using nikos &apos; cellphone ,
and mato will show up in person at the bail office .
it &apos;s how they do it .
i &apos;m so sorry , nikos .
kate .
oh , thank you . thank you .
uh , he needs medical attention .
first aid ?
uh , do you understand ?
medicina .
medicina ? si .
good , good . show me .
he needs it right now . right now .
why did you save me ?
why ?
because you know where agnes is .
is that the only reason ?
you need to keep pressure on that leg .
you &apos;ve lost a lot of blood .
i saved you because of agnes ,
but ...
also maybe because you might be telling the truth .
me llamo elizabeth keen . i &apos;m with the fbi .
that man was in my custody when our plane crashed .
medicina ?
no , no , no , no .
senor terrorist .
muy malo . muy malo .
terrorista ?
shh , shh , shh , yes .
uh , necesito un radio .
radio ? sí , sí .
do you have a gun ? pistola ? pistola ?
uh , i don &apos;t -- no comprendo .
no , slow down .
please slow down .
i believe he said the pistol is in the toolbox .
come in .
coast guard just intercepted a distress call on the gulf .
some cuban fishing vessel .
keen was on board .
so she &apos;s alive ?
you can come in , aram .
sorry , i just wanted to hear the update , which is ...
the greatest update ever .
did you talk to her ?
no , but we heard her voice .
the pilot was in the middle of giving the coordinates
when the transmission cut out .
the signal cut out ? why ? could you get it back ?
all that matters is that
the search teams have a target now .
they &apos;re gonna find that boat .
agent ressler ... the signal . what aren &apos;t you telling me ?
keen &apos;s voice .
the last thing we heard
was her asking if there was a gun on board .
honor the sacred ,
honor the earth ,
and everyone who shares it .
honor the elders ...
the 4 @-@ legged , the 2 @-@ legged ,
the winged ones ,
the plant and animal , people .
walk in beauty and balance .
i take photo for facebook , yeah ?
you don &apos;t want your money ?
i need to know that you &apos;re gonna safely deliver that baby to kirk .
his jet is waiting at m.i.a.
put the girl into kirk &apos;s hands only .
entiendo .
纳凯多克里尼
if this man dies --
it &apos;ll be your fault . you got him involved .
i need an eta .
intercept team should reach your position in 20 minutes .
they want to know how many passengers , over .
three passengers ,
and make sure there &apos;s a medical team standing by .
two passengers . over .
i know you were lying about believing in me .
but i promise , once we reach our destination ,
you &apos;ll know that everything i &apos;ve told you is true .
of course you believe that . you &apos;re a classic narcissist .
you were , what , abused as a child ? abandoned ?
made to feel powerless ?
you must &apos;ve suffered some sick , traumatic , dark event
to believe that the sick , traumatic dark things you &apos;ve done to me
and everyone i care about could ever result in me loving you .
you &apos;re doing fine , maisy .
he should be here any minute .
sorry about nikos .
you did your job .
i know , but ...
i didn &apos;t mean to ...
he knew where my baby was , all right ?
that &apos;s the only reason i pushed so hard .
why are you telling me this ?
because he &apos;s your friend .
so you want me to make you feel better ?
everyone wants me to make things easier for them .
cleaner .
that &apos;s what i am , after all , the cleaner .
just forget i brought it up .
in my desire to make life easier for your baby ,
i betrayed raymond ,
and now he doesn &apos;t know what to do with me .
well , he knows what he has to do ,
and he wants me to make it easier for him .
but i won &apos;t .
i &apos;m not here to make him feel better ,
and i &apos;m not here to make you feel better , tom .
i need some air .
where &apos;s my daughter ? !
where &apos;s my daughter ?
where is she ? !
where -- where &apos;s my daughter ? huh ? where is she ?
tom !
let &apos;s get out of the heat .
thank you .
of course , raymond .
found your boat near madeira bay ,
a few miles offshore .
it &apos;s being escorted to a nearby marina .
was there anyone on board ?
where &apos;s the survivor ?
excuse me .
fbi . we need a minute .
sir , the woman , the one who was with you ,
where is she ?
no entiendo .
they took her away in a speedboat .
who took her away ?
terrorista .
where the hell are they ?
put romina on the phone . i want agnes to see her mother .
where is she ?
we &apos;ll all be together soon .
hi , agnes . hi .
did you hear that ?
we &apos;re gonna be together soon .
i love you .
this &apos;ll be quick ,
as i have no time and less patience .
tell me where alexander kirk
took elizabeth keen and her daughter .
the strong silent type .
you &apos;re not doing much to break down stereotypes here .
i &apos;m not afraid of pain .
or dying , i &apos;m sure .
you know , some years back , i was hiking devils tower
for a bracing dip in the spiritual vortex ,
when who did i run into
but the tribal leader of the lakota nation ,
a man of vast responsibility .
he invited me to witness
the extreme version of the sun dance ritual .
not just anyone can attend the sun dance .
true , and you can &apos;t get a table at the fat duck
without a reservation .
but i find in either case ,
a generous donation gets you in the teepee .
i watched a tribal member , much like yourself ,
suspend himself from a cottonwood tree
with flesh hooks through his chest .
three hours he dangled ,
skin stretched like salt water taffy ,
while he left his body
to communicate with the great spirit .
like you , the man on that tree didn &apos;t fear death .
but you know what terrified him ?
the thought of eternity on earth ,
trapped in a dark box ,
surrounded by rotting flesh ,
forever .
i hear that &apos;s why some native people leave spirit holes
in their caskets , to allow their souls to pass on to
the next great hunting ground in the sky .
after i shoot you , sir ,
you will be locked in an airtight , concrete crypt ,
unless you tell me what i need to know
before those figures stop dancing .
kirk said they &apos;re going to the summer palace .
that &apos;s all i know .
yes .
i know the summer palace .
what is this place ?
it &apos;s yours . it belongs to you and agnes , of course .
it &apos;s a lovely location to raise a little girl ,
don &apos;t you think ?
the armed goons don &apos;t do much for the landscape .
well , the coercion was necessary and temporary .
all i ever intended to do was show you ,
prove to you who you are , who i am .
and then you can choose for yourself .
like a russian fairy tale .
that &apos;s right .
excuse me , elizabeth . i have much more to show you ,
but my physician is waiting for me .
hello , elizabeth . my name is katja .
you can think of me as the palace keeper .
palace ?
the summer palace .
it &apos;s what mr. kirk calls the cottage .
anything you need during your stay , let me know .
director cooper .
i know where elizabeth is , harold ,
where kirk is taking agnes .
cape breton island , nova scotia .
kirk owns a cottage there where he would go
to escape the dreary summers in novosibirsk .
are they hurt ? injured ?
i don &apos;t know and i can &apos;t find out .
i &apos;m deep in the heart of amarillo , texas .
how quickly can your people get there ?
agents ressler and navabi are flying back from miami .
i can redirect their plane .
i &apos;ll send you a location .
i &apos;ll handle this quickly .
you always do , kate .
can i get you something else ?
yes . my daughter .
i understand , elizabeth .
i know some of what you &apos;ve been through ,
but little agnes will be here soon .
and when she &apos;s here , you will need your strength .
tell me about kirk .
how long have you known him ?
i have worked here for nine years .
i took over from my mother .
she worked my entire childhood
maintaining the summer palace .
so you know him well ?
no , actually , i don &apos;t .
he hasn &apos;t visited here in years .
it &apos;s been ...
too painful for him .
until now .
卡希坦卡故事
this was my bedroom .
welcome home , masha .
i promised you the truth .
but ... there was a fire . i ...
i shot my father . i remember .
what &apos;s the memory of a small child ?
you didn &apos;t remember me or your mother or this room .
reddington lied to you , masha .
he told you your father was dead ,
but thanks to you -- what you did on the water --
i &apos;m very much alive .
all the stories reddington &apos;s told you about who he is
and his connection to you --
he knew you were looking for answers
and he took advantage of that to re @-@ enter your life .
but the answers you &apos;ve been looking for are here .
reddington , he was in love with your mother
and he &apos;s obsessed with you .
but it can &apos;t be true .
but you know it is .
i &apos;m sorry . i said too much .
you must be feeling overwhelmed .
i &apos;ll go and check on your daughter &apos;s arrival .
do you know why i call this cottage the summer palace ?
we came here for a vacation one july ,
and my little princess loved it .
it &apos;s been a palace ever since .
spread out ! come on , let &apos;s go !
return fire !
no .
move in ! move in !
hands in the air ! in the air !
stand down !
stand down , she &apos;s one of ours .
secure the house . find kirk .
find that child .
he &apos;s gone ,
and if agnes is with him , she &apos;s gone , too .
he &apos;s waiting for you inside .
where are we ?
home . your home .
let &apos;s go .
what is this place ?
i &apos;m gonna find her .
stay with the car .
there are places back here
that have never borne a human footprint .
53,000 acres of virgin wilderness ,
all but one owned by the bureau of land management .
one acre , a jewel .
a single buildable acre .
like a flawless diamond set in a sea of emeralds .
the real estate equivalent of a unicorn .
i acquired it some years ago from a family
who had held it in trust for over a century and a half .
beautiful .
yes .
you understand , kate , that i --
have no choice ?
isn &apos;t that the speech , raymond ?
that i know too much ?
every single one of your weaknesses ,
all your faults ,
all your secrets .
i dedicated my life to you .
you entrusted me with everything you value --
your freedom , your life ,
a child .
i have never failed you .
what you see as a betrayal of trust
was actually a fulfillment of your wishes ,
to protect your interests .
no more , no less .
you presumed to decide what was best for me .
even if i resolve the anger ,
the pain you caused ...
i can &apos;t trust you .
ever .
i &apos;m standing before a stranger .
and yet , i know you believe
what you did was best for elizabeth ,
which is why i brought you here .
you &apos;ve told me you &apos;ve always wanted
a pristine , unspoiled place to live out your days in peace .
so the acre is yours .
for all eternity .
