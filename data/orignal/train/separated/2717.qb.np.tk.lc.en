jesus christ -she was getting better
then last week another flare @-@ up
how about the prozac ? is it helping ?
she can &apos;t even sleep
look at her i &apos;d like to start you on a regime of prednisone it &apos;s a steroid
like for weightlifters ?
i &apos;ve had great success
treating this type of condition

he did it i swear not me
what &apos;s matush &apos;s last name ?
i don &apos;t know
he &apos;s foreign the mid east or something

i gotta fax a copy of my passport
you can &apos;t go to kinko &apos;s ?
the guy &apos;s waiting
two seconds i swear
it &apos;s in the office but hurry
if christopher sees you he &apos;ll shit
that &apos;s for you
this guy was at the club the dead guy

he went through a period of rediscovering his religion
he don &apos;t even do drugs any more he just deals
every month he sends all his money home to his family
in pakistan ?
his brother runs a prep school some place for young boys
i was very impressed with that
he &apos;s buckled down he &apos;s much more serious as a person
does christopher know what happened ?
no ! are you crazy ?
you &apos;re guilty of obstructing an ongoing
investigation into a drug @-@ related homicide
you are looking at 25 years
but i didn &apos;t do nothing
take your head out of your ass -you knew what you were doing
we can arrest you now have you charged
