The bank loan came through.
In a lasagna box?
This is our lifeline.
And I will pay it all back.
If the bank finds out about your unauthorized loan,
That's like a felony, right?
It's only a felony if they find out.
You're not the only one who's got stuff
they wanna keep from their parents.
You busy next Friday?
Jenna, no, wait, don't hang up. Damn it!
You just gotta stop working on these videos. They're dangerous.
Especially since the people that we're talking about
are in this town watching me.
What are you-- Hanna!
You are out of the phone tap business.
Ezra, meet me tonight at 8:00.
If you come, it means that there's still a chance for us.
I hooked up with someone when I was away.
You said it was over, right?
It looks like he won't take no for an answer.
Training a horse is an art.
You have to work with the animal,
taking all the fight out if it until it truly is broken.
That's how you're gonna feel when I'm through with you.
We're moving back to Rosewood.
"We"?
Me, Isabel, Kate.
Kate's going to be in Rosewood?
What do you mean, she destroyed the flash drive?
I kept a copy of the files.
And I'll keep working on them, too,
if we keep it a secret from Hanna.
Check this out.
What is it?
It's just an old box.
Turn the volume up.
Can you make the view full screen?
Maybe make it lighter. The picture seems really dark.
All right, that's it. I've officially stopped taking requests.
Can you guys like back up a little bit?
We're not even standing that close to you.
Really?
Then how do I know you had a cheeseburger for lunch?
Once you're a member of the club, you're always a member of the club.
Um, haven't we already seen this before?
Yeah, but look here.
It's the box Jason gave me of Ali's.
I still can't see what's inside of it, though.
Just give me a second.
It's Hanna.
We may be able to get a clear shot if I--
Hanna.
If I play it out frame-by-frame--
Uh, I can maybe blow up the image, but then--
Guess we know who's low man on the totem pole.
Yeah, I can't take this anymore.
Hey, Hanna.
Hey, Spencer. What are you up to?
Not much.
Oh, well, great. Do you wanna watch a movie?
Oh, come on, I'll even watch one
of those artsy foreign ones you like,
where all they do is stare out windows.
I'm sorry, Hanna, I really can't right now.
I'm just with my family.
Emily!
You guys, shut up!
Sorry, Hanna. I really have to go.
Uh, yeah. Yeah, sure. I get it.
Say hi to your family for me.
You're kidding me.
I'm sorry, she was--
Hey!
Ladies.
Is that a driver's license?
Yeah.
Is that Melissa?
I don't know. It could be Jenna.
It's just kinda hard to tell.
Hold on.
It's Ali.
But Ali already had a fake I.D.
And it definitely wasn't this one.
Why would she need an I.D. that didn't even look like her?
God, it's so weird seeing Ali with dark hair.
I can't even look at that anymore.
Sorry, guys, I gotta go. I'm meeting up Mia,
but,see you tomorrow.
Bye, em.
Bye.
Wait, do you have to go, too?
I was hoping that you could sleep over.
I thought maybe we could both use the company.
I'd like that, but I've made plans with Holden.
Oh. I thought you were only gonna hang out with him
so you could see Ezra.
Well, I was. But...
I don't know, we actually started to become friends.
So have you heard from Ezra?
No, I haven't.
I just can't believe that he never showed up
and he never called you.
Yeah.
How about you? Have you talked to Toby?
No.
I didn't see his truck outside.
No, I drove it back over to his parents' house.
I just sat in it for a while and, um...
and I listened to the radio.
I'm so sorry.
I don't know how you're holding it together.
Believe me, not as put together as I seem.
Okay.
You have to tell me the truth.
I feel like I'm the reason that we're lying to hanna.
Did I push us into doing this?
No, of course not.
There are just,certain situations that you have to lie to your friends,
even if you hate doing it.
Yeah.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I just...
I don't know.
You seem kind of distracted.
I am.
Look, lying to my parents was one thing,
but lying to my friends is really hard.
Aria, I'm not asking you to lie to your friends.
Well, it's not my friends that I don't trust.
It's... Other people.
I've been burned before.
I thought you said your mom was warming to the idea of us being a couple.
She's...Thawing.
And your dad?
How fast do glaciers melt?
Not very.
That's why they call it the ice age.
Well, you know what that means?
It just means we have to generate more heat.
So are your friends coming over?
No. I told you. They're being annoying.
What does that mean?
Never mind. It's not a big deal.
Okay, can we talk about the elephant in the room?
Kate is not an elephant, she's a snake,
and she's going to my school.
Mom, my life is completely ruined.
It's not ruined, it's just gonna be an adjustment.
The only thing she's adjusting are her plans to take me down.
I spoke to your dad and he said he made it clear to Kate
that there'll be serious consequences if--
Oh, please, she's not gonna listen to him.
Look, hanna...
I'm not exactly looking forward
to running into Isabel at the super market,
but if we don't take the high road,
We're gonna be the ones who end up looking like trash.
So just promise me that you will do
everything you can to make Kate feel welcome tomorrow.
Fine. I promise.
Hey, guys.
Hi.
How was the movie?
Pretty good.- Great.
You know what, you guys? Can you hang tight for just a sec?
I gotta get some cash out of the ATM.
Okay.
I am so sorry.
You sure know how to make a guy sweat.
No, I know.
We tried to take this shortcut, and then we ended up--
Don't worry about it. Okay, so...Dinner.
You had the pasta with pesto,
and I had linguini with meat sauce.
Okay, great. Did we get any sides?
Aria, your dad's not gonna ask if we ordered sides.
Oh, trust me, he will.
My mom's got him on this low-cholesterol diet,
and he's living vicariously through everyone else's meals.
Okay, then...
Uh, garlic bread?
Sure.
With extra butter.
So are we still on for tomorrow?
Yeah, sure.
What?
I just realized that this
will be the third time we've gone out this week.
What are people gonna think?
Let's keep 'em guessing.
So...
What did you guys have for dinner?
So what'd you guys do last night?
Oh, we studied for a chem test.
We went to Spencer's for help.
So today is doomsday, huh?
Why? Did you see her?
Han, maybe Kate wants to start fresh.
The last time I gave her the benefit of the doubt,
I ended up blowing chunks on my chunky heels.
Oh, my god! Is that her?
What?
Never mind.
Hanna, come on, you need to relax.
I would be if you guys were doing a better job keeping a lookout.
Hanna, I never got a good look at Kate to begin with.
The only time I've ever seen her was across a crowded church.
What is hanging out under your sweater?
Is that a dude's undershirt?
Maybe.
It's Toby's.
You guys, do not look at me like
I'm one of those dogs with wheels for legs, okay?
Em, when is your mom coming?
Tomorrow. I'm really excited.
Hanna?
Kate.
Welcome to Rosewood high.
Thanks.
Hi, I'm Kate.
We haven't officially met yet.
Hey, I'm Aria.
Emily.
Spencer.
So, I got my schedule,
and first period, I have history with Mr. Barocas.
Oh, yeah, Mr. Barocas. He's easy.
Everybody likes him.
Um, I can show you where it is.
I'm actually in that class, too.
Yeah, Kate, um, have we actually met before?
You're right, we have, at the wedding.
It's nice to have met you all. Bye.
Thanks for doing this.
I wouldn't have blamed you
if you decided to make me fend for myself.
Yeah, don't worry about it.
不然我就把你家通心粉盒里的秘密抖给警察
Are you okay?
Yeah. Oh, yeah, it's just my mom,
wondering what time I'll be home for dinner.
Who knows what she needed it for.
She was seeing Ian. Maybe they used to go out together.
So maybe Ali found a loophole, a way to fly under "A's" radar.
What, by being someone else?
Yeah, the brunette on the I.D.
I was never his number one fan,
but I can't even look at him now that he's with Jenna.
He's been going through girls in this school
like they're Kleenex.
Who cares that he's a player? He's "A's" new eyes.
It's so frustrating.
He and Jenna are always just out of reach.
If we could just get close enough to...
Wait. What if Ali wasn't trying to get away?
What if she was trying to get closer?
What do you mean?
By creating an alter-ego
so she could get close enough to investigate,
maybe even to expose "A."
Hey.
Hey.
Where's the monster?
Who?
Kate.
Oh, she's at orientation,
And she's being freakishly nice to me.
So why do you look like that?
Do you think that Caleb still has that video file somewhere?
Because "A" thinks he does.
What are you talking about?
I got a text saying to call off my 'techno-boy-toy."
"A" maybe just got their wires crossed.
Yeah, maybe they're just like a step behind or something.
Since when is "A" ever a step behind?
Where are you guys going?
Uh, we have chem.
Um, we'll talk to you later, okay?
Look, Hanna, I know it's not great timing.
Where are you going? To hang out with your family?
What?
Spencer, I used to be a member.
I know you guys are pissed at me for destroying the flash drive,
but you can't just shut me out.
I did this to protect Caleb,
and I would do it for any one of you if I could.
It just feels so weird watching them all celebrate
and not being a part of it.
What can I do? Steal their swimsuits?
No, no, no, drain the pool.
No, no, no, I got it, I got it.
Fill their shampoo bottles with nair.
Talk to me.
No, making them bald would
actually give them an edge on the competition.
Trust me, I've already considered it.
What? I'm kidding.
But thanks for offering.
It's my mom.
So...she's coming tomorrow?
Yeah. I've been missing her a lot lately.
Does she still hate me?
She never hated you.
She hated me liking girls, but she's fine with that now.
You sure about that?
'Cause the last time I your mom,
she was getting me hauled off to druggie boot-camp.
Okay, she didn't know
that your parents were gonna send you there.
Besides, she's a completely different person now.
I'll believe it when I see it.
So you moved here from Baltimore?
Yeah, so I can still go home on weekends
and visit my friends.
That's nice.
Do you have any family in Maine, by any chance?
Nope. No, all in maryland.
Have you ever been to Maine? The northeast harbor area?
Nope.
So, Kate, will you be joining any clubs or sports teams?
Yeah, I was actually thinking--
Debate!
Orchestra.
Sorry, I thought I must've seen you at a debate.
Are you sure that we haven't met before?
Pretty sure.
So I'm gonna head to class early
and introduce myself to the teacher.
I will see you all soon.
Bye.
What are you doing?
I know her. I know I know her.
I just don't know where I know her from.
Can you back off?
I'm not gonna let her complain to my dad
that my friends are giving her the fourth degree.
It's the third degree.
Whatever. Just stop giving her degrees, okay?
So did you?
Mom!
Look how gorgeous you are!
I feel like I haven't seen you in ages!
It's only been a couple weeks.
Now wait a minute.
Are you getting taller, or am I just getting shorter?
Shorter,
No.
and early.
I thought you weren't getting in until later tonight.
I know, but I wanted to surprise you.
Chocolate macadamia?
Yes.
And don't eat it yet,
because I made us an early reservation at the Grille.
Hey, do you wanna invite the girls?
I think they have plans tonight, but...
Is there someone else you'd like to invite?
Someone special? Maybe someone new?
In a way.
It's Maya.
We started seeing each other again.
Is she going to school here?
No, Radford.
Her family moved to Radford, so she's going to school there.
Well, why don't you ask her if she wants to join us for dinner.
Really? I know you weren't crazy about Maya.
Honey, there was a lot going on back then.
I feel like I really never gave her a chance,
and it'd be nice to have another opportunity.
Hey, come on, you guys. Let's go.
Hanna, come on.
Spence, you coming?
Uh, yeah, I'll see you guys in there.
Having trouble?
It'll come to me.
You know, it's funny.
I can remember every single locker combination I've ever had,
going all the way back to middle school.
Impressive. But ultimately useless.
But that's why I knew I'd eventually get it.
Shekomeko horse ranch,
summer of 2006.
I don't know what you're talking about.
My sister Melissa was a junior counselor that year,
and you were in her bunk.
Fine. You win.
We went to camp together.
And, yes, I'm her.
I'm exactly who you think I am.
So what is it gonna take?
What do you mean?
For you to keep this to yourself.
Do you want money?
I'm not gonna tell anyone.
But just so you know,
Melissa sent me a bunk photo that year.
So if you being nice to Hanna is just an act,
you'd better keep it up.
Why are you giving me a break?
Because judging from the way that you treated Hanna,
everybody's gonna see how ugly you are without any help from me.
If you have any trouble with the app,
just give me a call. I put my digits in there.
Cool, thanks.
Emily.
Hi, Maya. It's great to see you.
You look beautiful.
You know what they say about clean living.
Well, whatever you're doing, it's working for you.
Thanks.
I'm just gonna let her know that we're ready, okay?
So when did Noel become your phone repair guy?
Oh, he saw me struggling and offered to help.
He's really sweet.
No, he's not.
But his smile takes up half his face,
so I see how you could be confused.
All right, ladies,
I think our table's ready.
Nice work, Pam. You say jump and they say how high, huh?
Okay, so my dad said that he'd pick us up at 11:00.
Do you wanna meet back here at quarter till?
Sounds good.
Great. Well, have a good night.
You, too.
Thanks.
Actually, my plans kinda got cancelled.
So I was just gonna wait here till you got back.
You're kidding.
No, it's fine, really. I brought magazines.
I just didn't wanna bail on you.
I didn't wanna bail on you.
My plans got cancelled, too.
Seriously?
Well, why didn't you tell me?
I don't know. Why didn't you tell me?
Because I didn't wanna ruin your night.
Same here.
Okay, well, should I call my dad and have him pick us up early?
Look, seeing as we were both gonna kill time here anyway,
you wanna order a large to split?
I don't know. I'm not really--
I'll even get half plain, half green peppers.
Your favorite, right?
I cannot believe that you actually remember that.
You know what else I remember?
You, uh, used to be kind of a mean player.
Still got the chops?
I kinda just wanted to sit and read.
Oh, so you don't.
Okay, let's go. You're on.
You're dead, by the way.
So, mom, Maya joined the jazz band at her new school,
and they're really good.
Wonderful.
Thank you.
You know, actually, when I was in college,
I had a huge poster of miles Davis right over my bed.
I absolutely worshipped that man.
Really? That's surprising.
Really? I mean, what kind of music
would you think I would have been listening to?
Oh, I don't know.
Classical music, I guess. Something very sophisticated.
Well, I think jazz is sophisticated.
Oh, me, too, but, you know,
jazz musicians are also known for...
So, uh, Maya,
do you enjoy the people
that you're playing with in your jazz band?
Yeah, they're great.
Sorry about that.
It's just my stalker.
Excuse me.
Oh, nothing. I'm just kidding.
I dated this guy at true north,
and he's having trouble accepting that it's over.
But it's cool. Everything's fine.
Well, I'm glad to hear that.
What'd you pick?
Ooh! The notebook.
Um, I'm actually trying to wean myself off of that one.
Right, no, we don't have to watch that one.
You know what? No, let's watch it.
I'm just really glad that you came over.
So I'm not in the doghouse with you guys anymore?
No, you never were.
Well, good,
because I really don't need to stress out about that
on top of all this Kate crap.
Hanna, I really don't think that you need to worry about Kate.
She's been nothing but nice to you, right?
Oh, yeah, but it's a trap.
Do you remember in bio we learned about those animals
that can change their appearance to look harmless
and then they lull their prey into a false sense of security
and then they just bite their heads off?
That's Kate.
Hanna, do not lose sleep over this girl.
No, it's those fish! What are they called?
Fangblennies.
Yes.
Kate is a fangblenny.
No.
She's a boil n' baggy.
I don't remember that one. Is that like a blowfish?
I am showing you this to
prove that you have nothing to worry about.
Did you hear me?
What are those?!
They're bug bites.
God, it looks like something
laid eggs on her face and then exploded.
Ugh. I want more.
Melissa said everyone felt sorry for her for like a minute,
and she was the one with the skin condition,
but she treated everyone else like lepers.
What's this?
It's an I.D.
How did you get it?
Caleb came over after you destroyed the flash drive,
and he offered to help us as long as we kept it a secret.
From me?
I'm so sorry, Hanna.
No, please, just let me explain--
No, don't even try to apologize.
Hanna, no, come on, stay and talk to me.
I am such an idiot!
This whole time I'm worried about Kate backstabbing me,
I didn't even realize that you were holding a knife.
Hanna. Hanna!
Ok, I'll be right back. Would either of you two like some desert
Maybe. Is there a menu?
Thank you. We're fine.
Okay. I'm gonna go find our waiter and get the bill.
What the hell was that?
I thought we could get a brownie to split.
Stop. Why were you acting like that?
You're the one who's been
freezing me out for the last 30 minutes.
Because you completely torpedoed dinner.
How do you see that?
You kept making jokes about weed.
I made one joke and--
And every time I tried to changed the subject,
you brought it back to true north.
I asked you to start over with my mom.
And that's what I was doing.
I was trying to be honest.
Being honest is fine.
You were trying to get a rise out of her.
Why else would you bring up dating that guy?
I finally got my mom to come on board with me dating girls
And you bring that up?
It's confusing for her.
Is the fact that I dated a guy confusing for your mom...
or for you?
All right, we're all set.
I'm glad you could join us.
Thank you for inviting me. It's an honor.
No, it's a bunch of boring old farts discussing dead authors.
But it's nice to have some young blood in the mix.
I'll admit, I have an ulterior motive for dragging you here.
I've recommended you for an associate dean's position
at the New Hollis Satellite School.
I don't know what to say. I had no idea.
It's an honor.
If the board approves, and I can't see why they wouldn't,
you would need to be in Louisiana by the beginning of the month.
I assumed that the extension program was in Philadelphia.
No, it's in New Orleans.
We're participating in a grant program
set up to revitalize the city.
Well, I think I'll need a few days to think about it.
Ezra, I'll be candid.
You weren't on the short-list for this position.
It's only because Byron Montgomery
insisted you were perfect for the job
that I even considered it.
I don't get it.
You knew how long it took me to trust you again.
Why would you ruin that?
I didn't think you'd find out.
Wow.
Wrong answer.
Just let me finish, okay?
I didn't think you'd find out until
I solved whatever it is you guys are trying to solve.
I don't need that.
I needed you not to go behind my back.
Hanna, I know that you were trying to protect me,
but I was worried about you.
You're not the only one I'm trying to protect, Caleb.
Last year, it was really bad for me and my mom.
What do you mean?
No one really even knew because...
I was still wearing the same clothes and driving the same car,
but we were totally broke.
What's broke?
It might mean something
completely different for you than it does to me.
We almost lost our house.
My mom got money from the bank to tide us over.
Do you still need--
No.
That's not why I'm telling you.
My mom didn't borrow money from the bank.
She stole it.
I've never told anyone that,
not even my friends.
Thank you for trusting me.
I promise I won't tell anybody.
But someone else knows.
And they're holding it over me.
Who? Who?
Is it Jenna?
I don't know who it is.
But it's their phone that you're working on.
Winning really brings out the nerd in you, huh?
Okay, I'm gonna ignore all of your hostility right now
because I know that it comes from a place of shame.
How about some soda?
That's cool. I got.
So what happened to that theatre guy?
Uh, he couldn't make it tonight.
How long have you two been, uh...
We don't need to talk about that.
Rematch?
Gonna massacre you again.
Yes!
What were you doing?
Just knocking on the door.
Who were you looking for?
Jenna. Have you seen her?
No, not for a while.
What do you wanna see her about?
That's between me and her.
Well, if you're looking to get your old job back,
it's too late.
She found someone else.
No.
Actually, I came by to tell
her to stop threatening Hanna and her friends.
You better be a lot scarier than that
If you want Jenna to take you seriously.
I'm gonna go now.
Yeah, you do that.
Don't slam the door in my face.
I wasn't going to.
What I did, it wasn't an act of betrayal.
It was an act of desperation.
We've all been desperate.
That's not an excuse.
Okay, I know.
It's just that "A" Has taken everything from me.
Please, I can't lose you, too.
You haven't.
So my dad just texted, and he's almost here.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
What is that from?
Oh, it's nothing. I play touch football.
So does my little brother,
and I've never seen a bruise like that on him before.
Please don't say anything.
Holden, that's a serious bruise.
Promise me you won't say anything.
I was so stupid.
I thought if we could use the phone
to nail "A" once and for all,
it'd be worth the risk.
Makes sense.
I don't know.
We got nothing from the I.D.
It was a complete dead end.
I'm not so sure.
I didn't tell you this earlier 'cause I was mad,
but I've seen Ali with dark hair before.
You have?
Yeah, about two years ago.
Vivian, listen to me. It's fierce.
Can you please get Miss Darkbloom a cup of coffee?
It's your first time here, isn't, honey?
Yeah.
Okay.
You want cream or sugar,Vvivian?
No thanks, I don't like it sweet.
Ali?
Hanna?
What are you doing here?
My mom made me an appointment.
I didn't know you came here.
Your hair looks great.
I didn't even recognize you.
Just trying something new, testing the waters.
Here's the thing.
I'm pretending to be someone else, so play along.
Okay...
But why?
Because I'm bored. I do it a lot.
You should try it some time.
I mean, aren't you just sick and tired of being you?
I guess I never told you guys before
because I thought it was just typical Ali weirdness.
What is it?
It's the name on the I.D.-- Vivian Darkbloom.
It's gotta be.
Now if we can only find out where she used it,
maybe we can figure out why.
"Vivian Darkbloom" Gets over 300,000 hits.
Is that good or bad?
"Vivian Darkbloom" Is a pseudonym
for Vladimir Nabokov.
It's an anagram of his name.
Speak English.
There were like ten big words in there I didn't understand.
He's an author. He wrote Lolita.
Is that the book with the heart-shaped glasses on the cover?
Yeah. How did you know that?
I stole it... From Ali.
What? Why?
I didn't really steal it, I borrowed it,
but I kept seeing her with it, and I was curious.
I was supposed to give it back to her,
but I never got the chance.
Hey, sorry I missed your call.
It's kind of early.
I know. I wanted to talk before school.
The thing is...
I do have a problem with you dating that guy,
but not for the reasons you think.
I have a problem with you dating anyone but me,
and knowing you're into guys and girls,
it just doubles the amount of people I have to compete with.
Trust me, you have no competition.
And you were right.
As much as I'd like to be zen about it,
I'm still mad at your mom for busting me.
So now what?
Can I show you something?
I started working on this last night.
Can I open my eyes now?
Yeah.
Oh, my gosh.
This is so beautiful.
My way of saying sorry for ruining dinner.
If the sharks won't let you back in the water,
I'll bring the water to you.
I can't believe you would do all this for me.
I admit, I like to live life in the grey area,
but the way I feel about you is crystal clear.
I love you, Emily.
I love you, too, Maya.
Hello, J&L.
Hey, you guys are open.
Yeah.
I just found my claim ticket.
It's a little bit crazy. It's from a really long time ago.
What's the number?
0421.
All right, hang on a sec.
It's a miracle, but I actually still have it.
When would you like to pick it up, Miss Darkbloom?
Hello? Miss Darkbloom, are you still there?
Hello? Yes, I'm here.
Thanks, Marin.
You made my day.
What?
What the hell were you thinking?
About what?
If that's taking the high road, what's the low road?
Did you have a stroke? You promised you wouldn't say anything.
