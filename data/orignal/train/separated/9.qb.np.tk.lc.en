第五季 第十七集
if i die before you ,
please don &apos;t let them read &quot; wind beneath my wings &quot;
at my funeral .
who knew it had so many verses ?
you think that we didn &apos;t know him or his family didn &apos;t ?
maybe he changed .
they said he liked nighttime walks in the snow ?
he hated the snow .
what about that food ?
i didn &apos;t know he cooked .
he didn &apos;t ! they &apos;re crazy .
i need another drink .
we were like the two mistresses at the irish funeral .
yep .
oh , i &apos;m sorry . i meant that metaphorically .
i know .
thank you .
to will .
to will , a real man .
he shall be missed .
my dad was a sloppy drunk .
i said i &apos;d never be like him .
you &apos;re not sloppy .
you &apos;re elegant .
mm , i always wanted to be like you .
no .
no , i did .
when i came to lockhart / gardner ,
the way you ... held yourself .
i was a great disappointment to my mother .
she wanted me to be a nurse .
get married , have three kids .
be a nurse .
my mom thinks i &apos;m a prude .
i know . she thinks i should loosen up
and get laid more .
oh , no .
oh , let me guess .
yep , it &apos;s david lee .
hey , let me answer .
it &apos;ll terrify him .
come on . he &apos;ll think we &apos;re merging or something .
come on .
i &apos;m so alone there .
partners look at me like i &apos;m a gazelle on the savanna .
they always looked at you like that .
no , this is different .
will was on a buying binge .
now we &apos;re overextended .
yeah , we are , too .
well , we should merge .
what ?
we should merge our firms .
how would we do that ?
by saying we will .
you would want that ?
well , i would want chumhum back .
that would solve a lot of my issues .
you &apos;d take chumhum and get rid of us .
no . we &apos;d draw up a contract .
i have to have someone to take will &apos;s place anyway .
our firms are fighting on a lot of fronts .
oh , and your client is divorcing our client .
no , your client is divorcing ours .
well , so , let &apos;s keep talking .
we &apos;ll make peace and ...
come on . we &apos;ll figure out how to make this work .
your husband &apos;s divorce lawyer &apos;s named david lee .
he can be very contentious , so don &apos;t get thrown by anything .
i don &apos;t get thrown by anything anymore .
we have leverage .
your husband ...
ex @-@ husband .
no , now , carol , remember ,
he &apos;s only your ex @-@ husband
when you grant a divorce .
otherwise , according to illinois law ,
he has to wait six months .
that &apos;s my leverage .
that &apos;s your leverage .
okay ? now , he wants to get remarried right now ,
but he can only do that if you say , yes , okay ?
excuse me .
alicia ...
am i early ?
no , i ...
what are you doing here ? you don &apos;t have to be here .
i thought you were taking the week off .
no , i &apos;m good . ready to go .
cary , please , i &apos;m fine .
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m not gonna fall apart on you .
let &apos;s go .
hello , carol . how are you ?
i &apos;m good , asher .
wow , you &apos;re tan .
i was in california .
oh ! huh , the book .
how &apos;s it selling ?
okay , that &apos;s enough small talk for now .
alicia , cary , welcome .
hello , cary and alicia .
excuse me a minute .
diane , what are you doing here ?
sitting in .
why ?
because i &apos;m here .
okay , we would rather this not be contentious ,
so we &apos;re willing to compromise .
carol will grant mr. mercer &apos;s request for a divorce .
mr. mercer is not asking for a divorce . he ...
we don &apos;t want this to be contentious , either .
good . then to answer mr. lee ,
yes , your client did ask for a divorce after sleeping with ...
we don &apos;t need to go into that here
if we &apos;re all agreed to our terms .
a grant of divorce in trade for leniency on the postnuptials ?
yes . so the only question is custody .
and since we all want what &apos;s best for nico ,
that would prove to be a simple matter of visitation rights .
good ! so basically , we &apos;re done . carol ?
if asher agrees .
all i want is for this to be over .
mr. mercer , if you can give me some wiggle room , i can get ...
david , he &apos;s already stated his preference .
yes , and i am offering my opinion .
mr. mercer ?
all i want is for everybody to be happy .
good . well , then we have a deal .
except for custody .
what the hell was that ? !
that was called turning down the temperature .
you ought to try it sometime .
diane , if this is about will ,
you should take a break and go on vacation .
david , i have some advice for you .
whenever you &apos;re tempted to bring up will &apos;s death
and credit my behavior to it , resist .
diane , i have some advice for you .
when in mourning , don &apos;t make big decisions .
at least for a year .
really ? !
gretchen , move david lee out of his current office
and into , um , that office back there .
you can &apos;t do that .
yes , i can .
i &apos;m on the infrastructure committee . too bad you &apos;re not .
is that a big enough decision for you ?
you know why she &apos;s doing what she &apos;s doing ?
why ?
i went to a bar after will &apos;s funeral .
i wanted to be alone .
i liked him . i miss him .
why is she doing what she &apos;s doing ?
and i happened to hear two women talking over a deal
suggesting their two firms merge .
and do you know what , david ?
those two women looked an awful lot like diane
and alicia florrick .
is this true ?
she wants someone who will be in her back pocket .
so , we should do something about it .
that was interesting .
we got the result we wanted .
cary , uh , do you have a minute ?
sure , what &apos;s up ?
mr. grant , this is cary agos .
mr. grant &apos;s has a case , and he &apos;s without representation .
yes , that &apos;s the problem .
lockhart / gardner won &apos;t take the case for obvious reasons .
because of will ?
yes .
listen , i don &apos;t think my
son &apos;s responsible for will gardner &apos;s death .
jeffrey was out of his mind .
the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office prosecuted him
for a crime he didn &apos;t commit .
that &apos;s what forced him to grab the gun .
it &apos;s the state &apos;s attorney that &apos;s at fault ,
and i &apos;m gonna sue them .
sue them for ?
wrongful prosecution .
a wrongful prosecution suit
is extremely hard to win .
yes , except that he &apos;s already
had a meeting with the state &apos;s attorney .
yes , he came to my house .
he came to you ?
yes , castro .
he apologized . he assured me
that heads would roll in his department .
he wants this to be over .
he wants to clear the decks .
uh , mr. grant , you know alicia florrick ?
yes . mrs. florrick , hello .
hello .
you were very nice to jeffrey .
all right , so let &apos;s take a step back
and discuss the idea of you filing suit .
cary &apos;s going to tell you
there &apos;s a very high bar for a wrongful prosecution ...
which is true .
what heads ?
what ?
you said castro said , &quot; heads would roll . &quot; which heads ?
well , he didn &apos;t say . is that important to the suit ?
no , we &apos;re just getting more of a sense of the facts .
why ? why &apos;d you ask that ?
we can &apos;t take this case .
because of will ?
oh , we ... we have to listen .
he &apos;ll just take the case to someone else .
cary , listen to me . you take this case , i quit the firm .
i understand .
i &apos;ll talk to him .
i don &apos;t give a damn .
alicia , he &apos;s meeting with the state &apos;s attorney .
he told us that in confidence . you cannot use it .
thank you , cary .
yes , um , hello . can you put me through
to a finn polmar &apos;s room . i think he &apos;s in the icu .
he had the gunshot wound to the shoulder .
mrs. florrick , your appointment .
oh , i see . when ? thank you .
sondra , i need you to locate the number of a finn polmar .
he &apos;s the new asa at the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office .
he just got released from the hospital .
sure . do you want me to connect you ?
just let him know i need to talk to him ,
and i &apos;ll be right back .
well , the sinclair mission
is exactly what families in illinois need .
and i really have to thank my wife
for bringing it to my attention .
my husband &apos;s being humble .
it didn &apos;t need to be brought to his attention .
well , we &apos;ll , uh , we &apos;ll agree to disagree .
at any rate , if you &apos;ll excuse us ,
alicia and i have to discuss our son &apos;s sat scores .
thank you very much .
can you stand back please . thank you .
are you all right ?
i &apos;m here posing with you for a photo op .
why wouldn &apos;t i be ?
because of will .
i &apos;m here for you , peter . what do you want from me ?
well , i &apos;d like my wife back .
i &apos;m here .
are you ?
oh , dear god , would everyone just stop thinking
i &apos;m falling apart at the friggin &apos; seams ? !
everyone ? when did i become everyone ?
good . i think we can handle shared custody now .
nico is five years old ,
and we don &apos;t want to disrupt his home life . are we agreed ?
hello .
hello , david. we &apos;re almost settled here .
good .
what nice offices , cary .
very 1990s t @-@ shirt factory .
thanks .
where &apos;s alicia ?
i thought she &apos;d want to be here for this .
she &apos;ll be here in a minute . what do you got ?
a nanny cam video .
what nanny cam video ?
you and asher agreed to have installed in your house .
what &apos;s this about , ash ?
uh , david . we &apos;re decided .
oh , my god !
you took that of me ? !
you were sleeping with one of my students .
what was i supposed to do ?
you ran off with your nurse !
i didn &apos;t run off .
what would you call it ? !
i &apos;d call it grounds for voiding your postnup .
infidelity .
you &apos;re trying to make me the villain ?
maybe we should settle this in court .
wait a minute ! you want to settle this .
you don &apos;t want this video shown in court .
then take 20 cents on the dollar .
like hell i will .
then we &apos;ll see you in court .
kalinda ?
i was just about to call you .
i , um , i need a favor .
okay .
i , uh , need you to go to will &apos;s apartment .
okay .
why ?
i need to know how many commitments we &apos;ve made
in new york and l.a.
his family boxed up his work things .
bring them back here .
okay , i &apos;ll , uh , i &apos;ll head over .
diane ?
david lee and damian are trying
to remove you as managing partner .
how do you know ?
i heard them talking .
without will , they feel ...
you &apos;re unprotected .
what do you want me to do ?
i don &apos;t know .
well , you have to gather votes to fight them .
it &apos;ll never end , kalinda .
i can &apos;t fight them anymore .
if they want to come after me , let them ...
freaking come after me .
well , let me see what i can do .
what do you mean ?
let me see what i can do for you .
okay .
thanks , kalinda .
the postnup is clear .
any actual evidence of infidelity
by either spouse invalidates the agreement .
actual evidence means evidence you can admit .
like this footage from mrs. mercer &apos;s own nanny cam .
excuse me . mrs. mercer didn &apos;t even know the nanny cam was there .
this evidence can &apos;t be admitted .
simmer down , everybody .
the illinois privacy law specifically forbid videotaping
someone in their own house without their consent .
oh , please .
please what ?
her husband was spying on her .
who &apos;s deaf in here ? !
thank you very much .
so , the videos are from a nanny cam ?
it shows clear as day ...
i don &apos;t need your testimony , mr. lee .
just an answer .
yes , your honor . they had cameras in locations
throughout the house .
not &quot; they . &quot; him .
mrs. mercer didn &apos;t even know they were there .
i don &apos;t need yours , either , mrs. florrick .
that &apos;s what the witnesses are for .
do you have a witness ?
you had no idea
your husband bought a home surveillance system ?
absolutely not .
and that he put cameras all over your house ,
including in your bedroom ?
he never said a word .
so you had no idea your private activities were recorded ?
none .
and you have an expectation of privacy in your home ?
especially in your bedroom ?
of course i do .
carol asked me to install the nanny cams .
and when was this ?
right after our son was born .
why did she want them ?
she had an emergency c @-@ section with nico ,
and she was in bed recovering for a few weeks .
and since i &apos;m limited physically ,
we needed help in the house .
so , your wife wanted to keep an eye on the help ?
yes .
that was the plan . but then her mother came .
don &apos;t bring my mother into this !
mrs. mercer .
i &apos;m only saying
i bought this high @-@ tech system and she never used it .
look , she champions the use of these things on ...
on her mommy blog .
it &apos;s not my fault if one caught her cheating .
in your bed , in your house .
objection ! it &apos;s a shared home .
only mr. mercer &apos;s name is on the mortgage .
that &apos;s a technicality .
okay , thank you . always a pleasure .
i will decide on this issue in a few hours .
do you want to see the video , your honor ?
nicely argued .
where are you going ?
mr. polmar ? hello .
mrs. florrick .
hello . i &apos;m sorry , i had a hard time getting you on the phone .
my , uh , assistant thinks she &apos;s doing me a favor
by screening my calls , but unfortunately the only ones
that she lets through are family members .
thanks , maria .
how are you ?
oh , this ?
it &apos;s very indiana jones .
how close are you with james castro ?
jimmy ?
close , why ? do you need something ?
no , i @-@ i need to tell you something in confidence .
the s.a. is looking for a scapegoat
in the jeffrey grant prosecution .
and you are afraid that it &apos;s me ?
yes .
don &apos;t worry about it .
well , he has an election coming up
and this grant issue could haunt him .
jimmy &apos;s an old friend .
i &apos;m known him since law school .
i was best man at his wedding .
he &apos;s the one who dragged me out here .
okay , good to know .
but ... a word of advice .
if he does bring you in for a casual chat
about the grant prosecution ,
i would call a lawyer .
okay .
you think i &apos;m being cynical .
no , no . it &apos;s just , um ...
i have to trust someone .
especially after this .
you &apos;re right .
well , it was good to see you again .
you , too .
and if you ever want to talk .
thanks , but i &apos;m good .
alicia ?
mr. state &apos;s attorney .
that sounds odd .
jimmy &apos;s fine .
i never congratulated you
on your appointment , jimmy .
so , congratulations .
thanks . it &apos;s a challenge .
but i like challenges .
i was sorry about your old boss .
i liked will gardner .
thank you .
if i can do anything , please tell me .
oh , i will .
and just know i &apos;m doing everything i can here .
i always ask myself what would your husband do
when he was state &apos;s attorney ?
then i &apos;d try to do the opposite .
no .
i &apos;m joking . he &apos;s a good guy .
well , good luck , jimmy .
i don &apos;t know exactly what &apos;s on this nanny cam video ,
but i do know this .
the court &apos;s interest in ruling on the viability of this postnup
is not as great as mrs. mercer &apos;s privacy .
your honor , if i may ...
you may not .
i forthwith enter a six @-@ month separation order .
now ?
if mr. and mrs. mercer can &apos;t work this out
over the next half year ...
your honor , a new issue
has come to our attention .
oh , really ?
just now ? my goodness .
my client would like to file an emergency petition
for full custody of his son .
what ?
sit down .
on what grounds ?
child endangerment .
carol is the primary caretaker .
that &apos;s the emergency . this video will prove
that carol mercer is an unfit mother .
your honor , you already ruled
the nanny cam recording inadmissible .
only as to viability of the postnup .
but child welfare trumps privacy .
i &apos;m sorry , your honor , but i fail to see
even if the video shows
what mr. mercer contends ,
how that would endanger their child .
i &apos;ll be happy to show you .
your honor , this is a ploy .
a way for you to see evidence that you already ruled inadmissible .
yeah , sorry .
but if we &apos;re talking about the best interests of a child ,
i &apos;m looking at everything .
the video &apos;s admissible .
just don &apos;t make a meal of it , mr. lee .
sit up .
and don &apos;t look embarrassed , okay ?
mama ?
okay , got it .
i &apos;ll hear testimony on professor mercer &apos;s petition for full custody .
your honor , what the video shows is unfortunate ,
but it doesn &apos;t rise to the level of child endangerment .
the video constitutes a facial showing of irresponsibility
on the part of mrs. mercer .
anthony and i have been friends for years .
and it only happened once . so you say .
i &apos;ll hear testimony on professor mercer &apos;s petition for full custody .
alicia ?
yeah .
always nice to see how lockhart / gardner works .
kalinda , i &apos;m ...
when i &apos;m in town ,
i make sure to be home to tuck him in .
i ... wheel up next to his bed
and read to him .
and when you aren &apos;t in town ?
he &apos;s always on my mind .
thank you .
no further questions .
let me cross .
why ?
because i have this .
professor mercer ,
would you describe yourself as a materialist ?
excuse me ?
your book ,
the philosophy of materialism ,
describes you as an empirical materialist .
i &apos;m just wondering if it &apos;s accurate .
uh , yes , that &apos;s a ...
a general term for the philosophy i teach .
the basic contention of which
is all humans are a collection of atoms ?
that &apos;s a very simplistic view of it .
give me the non @-@ simplistic view .
do we have three hours ?
yes .
the basic contention of empirical science
is that the universe is knowable .
and we are all made up of physical matter .
including the human consciousness ?
of course .
including whatever emotions we feel ?
objection , your honor . i &apos;m at a loss
for what this has to do with ... anything .
the subject of this hearing is custody .
professor mercer argued that he was a good parent ,
and that my client was a bad parent ,
based on the activities he videotaped .
i am just trying to figure out
the components of his good parenting .
by questioning his teachings ?
yes .
get specific fast , counselor ,
unless you want the objection sustained .
thank you , your honor . professor ,
do you believe that free will is a fiction ?
no . i ...
&quot; chapter two : on choice . the physical interaction of our atoms
is the sine qua non of thoughts , feelings , actions .
we may believe we have free will ,
but it is , in fact , the illusion of free will . &quot;
did you write that ?
that is the position i take in my book .
so it &apos;s not really a position you believe ,
the illusion of free will ?
well , y @-@ you &apos;re taking my positions from a book and suggesting ...
that &apos;s how you &apos;ll bring up your son , yes .
do you believe in right and wrong ?
of course .
in what way do you believe in right and wrong ?
objection . asked and answered .
no , not really .
you may answer .
do you believe in right and wrong , professor ?
if your son shoplifted a soda from a grocery store ,
why would that be wrong ?
because it would impact the grocer &apos;s business .
but why is that bad ?
if the grocer is made up of a collection of atoms ,
why does that matter ?
because it &apos;s wrong to hurt people .
really ?
objection .
that time , asked and answered .
sustained .
your honor , may we take a short recess ?
so things , uh ... settled down for you yet ?
a bit .
state a.g. keeps pushing
for a timeline on the jeffrey grant case .
why ?
just ... bureaucracy .
they don &apos;t get what we do here .
could you put that together for me ?
yeah .
sure .
thanks .
hey , when did you drop the professor
as a suspect , by the way ?
when did i ?
when was he dropped ?
i don &apos;t know . let me , uh ...
let me take a look back .
great .
hey , we &apos;re okay , right ?
sure , what do you mean ?
nothing .
i &apos;ll talk to you later .
all right .
maria , can you get me the number
for alicia florrick at florrick @-@ agos , please ?
thank you .
how did you know i was off today ?
lucky guess .
shouldn &apos;t you be working ?
what happened with jeffrey grant ?
jenna ...
okay .
when we left off , professor ,
you said you believed
in right and wrong ,
and that it was wrong to hurt people .
professor ?
i said that this was a custody hearing .
my scientific materialism doesn &apos;t apply here .
&quot; chapter five : on morality .
humans create value systems
to organize the world .
pleasure is good , pain is bad .
charity is good , murder is bad .
but they are random
and , in fact , meaningless . &quot;
do you not believe this ?
professor ?
i do .
your honor , objection .
mrs. florrick has a new guest in court .
who is it ?
counselor ?
yes , your honor .
it &apos;s professor thomas nile .
he &apos;s the leading non @-@ materialist
and professor mercer &apos;s rival .
welcome , sir .
so , professor ,
you believe your son , nico ,
is nothing more than a product of his atoms ?
my son is a glorious result of the miracle of nature .
yes .
which means ... a product of his atoms ?
yes .
so when he dies ,
what remains of him ?
he &apos;s gone .
when someone dies ,
there &apos;s nothing
left of them ?
that &apos;s why
i plan to value every moment with my son .
i will hold him
and love him
and teach him .
but to what end ?
why ?
how &apos;s grace ?
she &apos;s good .
you &apos;re very brave out there .
thanks .
i got arrested at wrigley field .
that was pretty cool .
i think i made a mistake .
what mistake ?
being a lawyer .
you don &apos;t like it ?
no .
i don &apos;t know . sometimes i do .
what would you do instead ?
i have no idea .
i wish i did .
do you want to dance with me ?
no .
i think i &apos;m going home now .
mom . mom ...
diane lockhart &apos;s on the phone .
and you missed a few other calls , too .
hello ?
i &apos;m , uh , sorry to call you at home , alicia ,
but you weren &apos;t picking up your cell
and your office didn &apos;t know where you were .
it &apos;s okay .
um ... things are moving quickly here ,
and i don &apos;t want us to lose momentum .
i just need to know if we &apos;re ...
if we &apos;re still talking merger .
can i call you back ?
well , alicia ,
if you &apos;re trying to leverage this
to get a better deal ...
no .
i can &apos;t , uh ...
i &apos;m a little under the weather .
let &apos;s talk when i &apos;m feeling better .
well , alicia , can ...
mom , are you okay ?
yeah . you want us to get you a nyquil or something ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;ll get you a nyquil .
could you make her tea ?
yeah .
well , very good .
you know , this job is like building track
in front of a bullet train .
you ready ?
yeah , absolutely .
i &apos;m sorry to drag you through this .
yeah , no problem .
so i went back through the grant files ,
and i found a bunch of e @-@ mails about the professor , delaney ,
rejecting him as a suspect .
uh , when was this ?
october .
okay . good .
uh , e @-@ mails between you and geneva ?
no , between you and me .
really ?
yeah .
i guess you thought professor delaney &apos;s alibi was a little bit dodgy ,
but then jeffrey grant &apos;s name popped up
and all those concerns just disappeared , so ...
i &apos;ll have to go through my records .
yeah .
that &apos;s a good idea .
you know what we &apos;re trying to do here , finn ?
we &apos;re trying to bring something to chicago that it &apos;s never seen .
a state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office that is fair .
fair in prosecution , investigation and sentencing .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m here .
good .
one of these days , i &apos;m gonna need your help .
with ...
if i don &apos;t get elected next year ,
this office will go right back to what it was .
yeah , okay .
i &apos;ll talk to you .
to what do i owe the pleasure ?
what &apos;s this ?
it &apos;s a copy of a retainer agreement for a new client
that diane just signed .
and she thinks this will save her ?
i think she does .
william donnelly ?
yeah . the donnelly family
has one of the big import @-@ export businesses
in your old neighborhood .
diane really wanted to represent them ,
so she offered them a discount to come aboard .
she ...
come @-@ come on board here ?
mm @-@ hmm . lockhart / gardner .
our newest client .
she can &apos;t .
it &apos;s done .
a copy of the retainer agreement
is already in the mail to a friend of yours .
liam gerraghty ?
his organization has had quite a few disagreements
with mr. donnelly over the years ,
all of which have been sorted with some struggle .
i wonder how mr. gerraghty will view your firm
representing his competition .
so how did you find out about me and the gerraghtys ?
the copy was sent by express mail , by the way .
so unless you fancy explaining yourself ,
you have about 18 hours to quit the firm .
good @-@ bye , damian .
people just think there are black hats and white hats ,
but there are black hats with white linings .
white hats ...
with black linings .
and there are hats that change back and forth
between white and black .
and there are striped hats .
hey , mom ?
evil rests in the soul of all men .
hey . do you want some dinner ?
i &apos;m all right .
you sure ?
you should probably just eat something .
i will later .
and there is nothing you can do
but curse god .
thank you both for agreeing to sit down .
make it quick ; i have work to do .
um , where &apos;s alicia ?
oh , she asked me to step in for her .
we &apos;re prepared to compromise on the divorce settlement .
we &apos;re not .
david ,
both our clients have been bloodied here ,
and there &apos;s no way to predict which way the judge will go .
professor mercer will honor the terms of the postnup
regarding child support and alimony .
in return , our client will grant him a swift
and uncontested divorce
so he can remarry .

but if you think your life would &apos;ve been better with will ,
you are kidding yourself .
stop it , peter !
no , i &apos;m not gonna let you throw away this marriage
because you have some idealized notion
of a man who you &apos;re not even sure cared about you !
you &apos;re a bastard .

but you know what ? !
we &apos;re all that we have .

if you need me at a political event ,
you call the office .
my assistant will put it on my calendar .

i &apos;m not finished .
you are free ...
to see and sleep with whomever you like ,
but i don &apos;t want to know ,
and under no circumstances
are our children to know .
