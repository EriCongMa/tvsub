i once saw a boar
kill a tiger in india .
this is serious business , okay ?
i &apos;ll tell you why .
boars are deadly ,
unpredictable beasts .
they are everywhere on this island .
they are all around us right now .
they can attack without warning ,
so you guys have to be ready to protect yourselves at all times .
you understand ?
good .
we &apos;re gonna talk about the kill zone now .
this is very important , okay ?
seriously ?
kill zone ?
i am very sorry .
i thought you brought him here to teach them survival skills .
you brought colonel kurtz .
if it charges me , it &apos;s a 300 @-@ pound animal ,
and it &apos;s crazy , okay ?
it &apos;s gonna kill me .
look ... i made a terrible mistake , and i can see that now .
i apologize . okay ?
hunters make the mistake , they think they can
get through the body armor of a pig .
lucy , where you going ?
just getting my sweater .
all right , come right back .
the most vulnerable spot
is right between the shoulder blades .
this is my weapon of choice .
that &apos;s right .
it &apos;s got a 10.5 @-@ inch razor sharp .
okay . okay , i &apos;ve had it .
i &apos;m gonna go check on lucy .
make sure he doesn &apos;t kill anybody .
i @-@ i @-@ i &apos;m pretty sure he won &apos;t kill anyone .
where did she go ? we good ?
yeah , we &apos;re good . let &apos;s , um ...
let &apos;s take this opportunity to talk about something else .
something useful , like how to find fresh water .
or , uh-- i don &apos;t know-- how to build a pillow out of @-@ of
flowers , something like that ,
something appropriate for the age group .
yeah , we could definitely do that .
okay .
or ...
who wants to learn how to do that ?
you know what ? there &apos;s something pathologically wrong with you .
you know that , right ?
no . i &apos;m gonna teach these girls
how to kill and gut a pig tonight , danny .
that &apos;s a survival skill .
that &apos;s actually a horror film .
has anybody seen lucy ?
she just went to go get her sweater .
no . she &apos;s not there . lucy ? lucy ? !
okay , she couldn &apos;t have gotten too far .
danny , why don &apos;t you check the camp bathroom ?
okay . i &apos;ll check the trail . okay ?
lucy ?
lucy ?
lucy ? !
lucy ?
lucy ?
lucy ?
lucy ? !
here . i &apos;m here .
lucy , you can &apos;t go
wandering off like that , okay ?
he needs help .
who needs help ? where are you going ? lucy ? !
his name is ron . 50 years old .
deep laceration on his leg .
he &apos;s dehydrated
and might be in shock .
that &apos;s about size of it .
that &apos;s a very thorough report , lucy .
thanks . going for my first aid patch .
all right .
so , ron ?
yeah .
what happened ?
i went for a hike yesterday morning .
i slipped on some mud
and fell off this ravine ,
came crashing down on a rock ,
and it cut my leg up pretty bad .
lost my phone
and all my gear . i tried to hike out of here ,
but the pain was too much .
a man of his age and condition really shouldn &apos;t be hiking .
that your professional opinion , lucy ?
you know , i &apos;m really lucky she found me
&apos;cause i thought i was gonna die in here .
well , you &apos;re not gonna die ,
but we &apos;re gonna need to patch this up
before we move you .
you can use this .
are you sure ? it &apos;s gonna be ruined .
i want a new one anyway .
okay . your mom &apos;s gonna kill me .
all right , ron .
lift your leg , ron .
okay .
okay , good .
okay .
there you go . that &apos;s it .
i &apos;m steve mcgarrett ,
by the way . i &apos;m with five @-@ o.
oh , wow , you &apos;re a cop ?
yeah .
oh , i got lucky .
yeah . you &apos;re in good hands .
see if you can stand .
you all right ?
oh , yeah .
that &apos;s good . i can put a little weight on it .
they teach you that in cop school ?
he &apos;s a navy seal .
really ? is he an astronaut , too ?
oh , this is perfect .
all right , walking stick .
our camp isn &apos;t far .
oh , you guys aren &apos;t out here alone , huh ?
no . i got about a dozen aloha girls with me ,
and i &apos;m pretty sure they &apos;re all gunning for a first aid patch .
right , luce ?
yeah .
so you , my friend , are gonna be very popular .
come on .
you know what ? i feel pretty good , man .
i think i &apos;ll be all right .
why don &apos;t you guys go back to the camp and have fun ?

just come on back .
i &apos;ll have the paramedics meet us .
give me your phone .

and the knife ... now .

plane &apos;s at the gate .
shouldn &apos;t be long now .
okay .
thank you ... again for ... for being here .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;ve ever seen you this nervous before .
he &apos;s your brother , okay ?
yeah , who i haven &apos;t seen in ten years .
and the entire time michael was in prison ,
he never let me visit , not once .
adam , maybe he was embarrassed .
i mean , you were the golden child , right ?
the college boy .
that &apos;s a lot to live up to .
actually , in some ways , i was trying to live up to him .
michael and my father were ... very much alike .
so ,
what does he think about you legitimizing the family business ?
he , uh ... he doesn &apos;t know yet .
smile . we &apos;re on camera .
what do you think , fbi ?
i &apos;m sorry .
when you &apos;re a noshimuri ,
it , uh , sort of comes with the territory .
once they figured out you &apos;ve changed ,
that &apos;ll stop , too .
hey , he &apos;s here .
welcome home .
well , come here .
i missed you .
it &apos;s good to see you , brother .
hello , beautiful .

how to remove a bullet from a gunshot wound ?
okay .
you can just keep it in for now .
all right , let &apos;s see what we have .
okay .
now remember , apply pressure ...
until the bleeding stops .
all right .
now , girls , go find some , uh , sleeping bags and blankets ,
and let &apos;s try and get some shut @-@ eye , okay ?
okay .
that &apos;s very good , i @-@ i didn &apos;t know
that the aloha girls were trained in triage .
yeah , well , my day job is as an er nurse .
you did great .
thank you , thank you , and i &apos;m-- hey--
i &apos;m really glad that i could , uh , provide
a teachable moment for everybody here .
we have to assess the situation .
the situation ?
well , for starters , we are locked in a supply shed .
i can see that .
uh , how about a key ?
i have a key , but
it &apos;s padlocked from the outside .
well , i cannot break that door down .
why not ?
because it opens inward , that &apos;s why not .
well , uh , the supplies picture is not much better .
i mean , other than lanterns and cooking gear and sleeping bags ,
we don &apos;t have much .
we have no water and no food .
no food , no water , okay , let &apos;s see about that .
hey , ladies ,
come on , let &apos;s gather around .
okay , um ...
all right , listen ,
i used to be
a , a boy scout briefly .
i was kicked out .
that &apos;s a , that &apos;s a long story .
i &apos;ll tell you at another time , grace .
anyway , uh , i did go on a couple camping trips ,
and this one time , uh , there was this kid ricky bonaducci--
italian kid from brooklyn ,
he moved over to jersey--
that &apos;s not the point . anyway , he ,
um , he-- one time he , he smuggled in
an entire rack of baby back ribs .
very difficult to do-- big rack .
okay , my point is this :
i know for a fact
that somebody here brought some food , so ...
you got kicked out of scouts ?
that &apos;s not the point ,
grace , but yes , i did . food ?
it &apos;s against the rules .
that &apos;s exactly right , caitlyn .
thank you .
forget the rules .
what about coming prepared ?
don &apos;t , please .
whatever .
anybody got any ideas , just throw &apos; em out .
oh , wait a minute .
you got a crowbar or something like a crowbar ?
a tent stake .
okay .
okay , good , no foundation .
all we got to do is rip up a
couple of these boards , we can dig our way out .
hand me another one of these .
grace , come here .
everybody grab a stake , let &apos;s dig .
come on , let &apos;s get these boards up .
rip up as many boards as we can .
where we headed , ronnie ?
shut up .
shut up-- that &apos;s helpful .
listen ...
i &apos;ve hiked these trails a bunch , okay , i know this area .

i can help us get there quicker .
yeah , i bet you &apos;re going to be a real helper monkey .
how you doing , luce , you all right ?
yeah .
stop talking .
no talking .
we &apos;re gonna go up here about two miles .

two miles-- not this way .
ron , the bridge is out .
how dumb do you think i am ?
you want an honest answer ?
you know what ?
i am so sick of arguing with you ! quit trying to trick me !
i &apos;m not trying to trick you .
yes , you are .
ron , listen to me , i &apos;m not trying to trick you .
the bridge is out this way .
well , we &apos;re going that way .
fine , no ...
go !
okay , whatever you say .
all right .
move it .
let &apos;s go , luce , we &apos;re going this way .
all right .
trust me , i know , it &apos;s a big change ,
but i really believe our father would approve .
we are just as profitable in legitimate business
as we were outside the law .
did you make this ?
this is delicious .
leonard &apos;s bakery .
i &apos;m not that good of a cook .
listen , michael .
i need to know that you &apos;re with me .
okay , we &apos;ve got a lot of repair work to do .
i need all the help i can get .
this is good for you .
okay , this is good for the family .
i &apos;m with you , brother .
that &apos;s great .
that &apos;s great .
so , listen , when you &apos;re ready ,
i can set you up in whatever job you want .
you name it-- marketing , hotel management .
okay , listen , listen , listen , listen .
yesterday i was having powdered eggs on the mainline
with 3,000 other felons .

what i &apos;m gonna be when i grow up .

i &apos;m really happy you &apos;re home , brother .

yeah .
your brother-- he &apos;s been working really hard
to legitimize your family business .
yeah , i just never thought i &apos;d see the day
i &apos;d be running a hotel for my brother ...
or having breakfast with his cop girlfriend .
really is a brand @-@ new world .
hope that won &apos;t be a problem for you .
no , i &apos;m cool with it .
very cool .
how we doing , grace ?
i found a worm .
don &apos;t worry , monkey , it &apos;s not gonna hurt you .

here &apos;s what we &apos;re gonna do .
all right , uh , lily and sara , firewood .
zoe and caitlyn , water source .
the rest of you , campsite cleanup , go .

this is a mess .
danny , that &apos;s blood .
all right , that &apos;s about the right height for ron &apos;s wound .
i &apos;m gonna get an evidence kit .
danno , look , we found the cell phones .
that &apos;s good , monkey ,
i got an idea those aren &apos;t gonna work , though .
but , like , one of the digital signal processors--
it &apos;s not broken .
digital what ?
it &apos;s like the heart of the phone .
the conversion chips translate the outgoing signal
from analog to digital
and vice versa .
nope , try again .
if i take the battery from this one
and the motherboard from this one ,
i might be able to get the phone to work .
ah-- she &apos;s talking to me like i &apos;m an idiot .
listen , i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about at all ,
but if you can make that work ...
will she get a patch out of this thing ?
all of &apos; em .
okay , good , go ahead , go ahead .
what do you know ? the bridge is out ,
just like i told you .
lucy , lucy , drink some water .
listen , stay behind me , okay ?
you &apos;re doing great .
okay .
all right ?
come on .
keep checking that map ; it &apos;s not going to change .
would you shut the hell up ? !
all right , shut up !
hey , didn &apos;t expect to find anybody up here .
you guys lost or something ?
no , no , no , we &apos;re just taking a break .
we &apos;re fine .
oh , y @-@ y @-@ you &apos;re hurt .
oh , i @-@ i &apos;m okay .
it &apos;s all right .
we &apos;re good .
we &apos;re about to get out of here actually .
we &apos;re gonna hit the , uh , api falls trail .
supposed to be beautiful .
you okay ?
i &apos;m okay .
all right , well , uh , good luck .
shoots .
actually i could use your help .
that was awesome .
that was an adrenaline rush ,
and i needed it .
i think i could hike for days now ,
but next time i &apos;m shooting you .
oh , hey , cuz .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i want you to see something .
that was your guy ?
what , are you spying on me now ?
no , i wasn &apos;t spying on you .
a friend of mine in an fbi field office
thought i should see that .
see what ?
yeah , two people at the airport .
you &apos;d better call homeland security ;
they &apos;re holding hands .
i &apos;m more interested in the guy you picked up .
yeah , that &apos;s his brother .
who was just released from prison , right ?
so ? chin , he did his time .
for manslaughter .
kono , michael noshimuri is a dangerous guy .
and i &apos;m gonna bet that ten years at pelican bay
didn &apos;t change that .
look , adam changed , and you know it .
you trusted him when my life was in danger .
you called him .
you trusted him with my life .
i am very grateful for everything that adam has done .
but it doesn &apos;t change the fact that
even though he turned over a new leaf , the yakuza hasn &apos;t .
and i guarantee you they are not happy with his new direction .
look , he &apos;s working on that .
and how does michael feel ?
lieutenant kelly .
chin , can you hear me ?
danny , is that you ?
nice . it works . good job , riley . all right , shh .
hey , you there , buddy ?
i can barely hear you .
aren &apos;t you supposed to be on a camping trip ?
yeah , well , that didn &apos;t go so well .
what happened ?
we got jacked .
is anybody hurt ?
aside from the fact that i got shot , no , everybody &apos;s fine .
can &apos;t speak for lucy and steve .
okay , we can have a chopper out to you in about 15 minutes .
no . no chopper . listen .
uh , this guy ron hears it ,
he &apos;s gonna know we got out .
right now , our only advantage
is this guy thinks nobody &apos;s onto him .
okay , there &apos;s a land and natural resources station
about five miles from you .
we can have them rendezvous with you
and get everybody out of there .
okay , good . uh , please have them
bring me a satellite phone and a weapon .
as soon as everybody &apos;s safe ,
i &apos;m going after lucy and steve .
they got several hours head start on you .
you sure you can catch up to them ?
he &apos;s got a bum leg . he couldn &apos;t have got too far .
i &apos;m heading your way now .
mahalo .
okay , thank you .
okay , so conservation officers are en route .
i &apos;ll stay on the line with you until they reach you .
okay .
thank you .
here &apos;s your phone .
there &apos;s a 30 @-@ hour charge in it .
there &apos;s extra ammunition in there , too .
thanks .
oh , hey , do me a favor .
take these to the hpd crime lab
and run it against codis .
i &apos;m pretty sure that &apos;s our guy .
will do .
hey , how well do you know the area ?
i don &apos;t know , i figured i &apos;d take a cab .
be careful , detective .
i don &apos;t want to have to rescue you again .
all right , thanks , buddy .
hey . hey , you .
come here , listen .
mom &apos;s on her way to come get you right now .
and i &apos;m really , really sorry
about your camping trip getting spoiled .
i &apos;m gonna make it up to you , i promise . all right ?
what about lucy ?
listen , i &apos;m gonna do my best ,
absolute best to find lucy , okay ?
i know you will .
you can do anything .
i don &apos;t know about anything ,
but i &apos;m gonna try my best .
okay , come here . i love you .
stay with this guy until mom gets here , all right ?
all right , let &apos;s get this show on the road .
day &apos;s already half over .
no , no , no .
you &apos;re going back with the girls , you &apos;re not going with me .
oh . and you &apos;re planning on what ,
finding your buddy with the power of your mind ?
you need me .
no , i &apos;m actually pretty sure i don &apos;t need you .
thanks , though .
which way is north ?
i know which way north is .
lie .
how do you start a fire without matches ?
how you gonna find fresh water ?
what are you gonna do when you run into a bear ?
a what ? a bear ? they don &apos;t got bears in here , do they ?
see , the fact that you don &apos;t know that
is reason enough for me to go .
look , you &apos;re injured .
i know these trails .
that is my camper up there .
my responsibility .
fine .
great .
don &apos;t slow me down .
there &apos;s no bears .
at least let me look at the dressing on your wound , ron .
it &apos;s fine .
you know how many germs thrive in this jungle ?
and that wound is a breeding ground for bacteria .
all right , leptospirosis , necrotizing fasciitis .
would you shut up ?
staph infection , fungal infection .
look at yourself , ron .
okay , you dizzy ? you got chills ?
you got double vision yet ?
would you stop it , okay ? ! stop it !
listen to me !
why ?
do it now !
you can &apos;t go on like this forever , ron .
i don &apos;t need forever , steve .
go . go !
here it is again .
you see it ?
circular indentation . it &apos;s very faint .
repeats itself every two feet .
it &apos;s ... it &apos;s got to be that walking stick ron was carrying .
huh . you know , i got to admit , i never would &apos;ve noticed that .
yeah , well , my dad taught me how to track .
he was big into hunting .
i mean , tracking &apos;s just about prediction , you know ?
you ... your prey leaves you a clue ,
you recreate what happened
and then try and figure out what it &apos;ll do next .
sounds like being a cop .
yeah , kind of .
you have a spider on your neck .
what do you mean ? where ?
it wasn &apos;t poisonous .
let me tell you something .
i hate this jungle . i hate jungles in general .
every jungle in the world i hate .
and no disrespect , but i &apos;m pulling grace
directly out of the aloha girls .
all right , i &apos;m putting her in ice hockey .
it &apos;s cold , there &apos;s no bugs
and no deranged kidnappers .
you know , you &apos;re the reason she does this .
i &apos;m the reason ?
hey , this wasn &apos;t my idea .
i told you , i got kicked out of the boy scouts .
yeah , well , she says it makes her brave ,
just like you .
brave like me . maybe i &apos;m not as brave as she thinks i am .
she &apos;s probably never seen you do that little spider dance .
yeah . you know , i promised her
that i would bring lucy back , right ?
she thinks there &apos;s nothing i can &apos;t do .
i can do anything , right , but one of these days
she &apos;s gonna realize i am not superman .
probably , but it &apos;s not gonna happen today . see ?
these tracks go right up this trail ,
but in a half mile it dead @-@ ends .
the bridge is out .
well . you know what , let me take a look at your arm .
no , it &apos;s actually pretty good ; you did a fantastic job .
thank you .
yeah , the bleeding stopped .
i think you &apos;re gonna live .
look at this .
okay , we got a parachute with blood .
maybe this is how ron hurt his leg .
so what , he jumped out of a plane ?
why ?
maybe because it was going down .
you &apos;re right , danny .
yesterday , a small plane
crashed in the jungle about five miles west of you .
according to the flight plan ,
it passed right over your location before it went down .
any survivors ?
the pilot was found dead ,
and the only other person on the flight was an armed guard .
he &apos;s missing .
all right , let me guess : ron .
yeah , he called himself ron rathburn .
fong ran the blood that you found at the campsite
and got a hit .
his real name is ron alberts .
he has a couple third @-@ degree theft convictions on his sheet .
he seems pretty small @-@ time .
there &apos;s nothing to indicate
that he &apos;s capable of kidnapping .
okay , well , maybe he &apos;s stepping up in the world .
you said he was an armed guard ? what is it that he was guarding ?
well , the plane was transporting a couple million dollars &apos; worth
of diamonds for a jewelry expo on the island .
and no surprise-- the diamonds are missing , too .
all right .
this is it .
it should be here .
look for a black backpack .
i @-@ i don &apos;t see anything .
you sure you &apos;re reading that thing right ?
these are the exact coordinates . it &apos;s here .
is that it ?
yes ! good girl !
good eye ! all right , you &apos;re up , jeff probst .
crawl up there and get it for me .
half of these branches are dead , ron .
it &apos;s not gonna hold my weight .
all right , kiddo ,
you have to go up there and get it .
i don &apos;t want to .
tell you what , sweetheart ,
you go up there and get that backpack ,
and i &apos;ll let you go .
won &apos;t that be great ?
tell her how great it &apos;s gonna be .
how bad it &apos;s gonna be if she doesn &apos;t do it .
lucy ...
i &apos;m gonna help you , okay ?
come on , it &apos;s going to be okay .
come on !
put your foot in my hands .
all right ?
push up .
good girl .
good girl .
there you go . hurry up . doing great .
okay , yeah , put your left foot up there .
okay , grab that big vine up there with your left hand , lucy .
that &apos;s right .
careful , careful .
good girl . attagirl , luce !
good job .
okay , grab it .
hold on tight up there , okay ?
come on .
come on , right here .
all right , lucy , good job .
good job .
all right .
okay , careful , lucy .
come on , hurry up . hurry up .
here you come , here you come .
keep coming , keep coming . throw it down .
drop it ! drop it , kid !
run ! run , luce !
toss the weapon .
over there .
do it !
or she &apos;s dead .
anything ?
shh !
shh ? no @-@ no @-@ no shush .
we just heard a gunshot .
can you make the trail or not ?
that &apos;s the stick ron was using .
okay , let me ask you a question :
where could they possibly be going from here ?

hpd was about to tow a car when they ran the plates
and found out it was stolen .
prints inside belong to a wilson hines .
he &apos;s wanted back on the mainland for several bank robberies .
i don &apos;t know who that is .
yeah , well , your boy ron does .
they did time together .
what are they , partners ?
looks like .
ron gets a job as an armed guard ,
steals the diamonds , and jumps out of the plane .
hines is his ride out of the jungle .
but something goes wrong .
ron screws up , gets separated from the loot .
that &apos;s why he needs steve to help him find it .
look , danny ,
hines is dangerous-- the last time he robbed a bank ,
a cop was killed .
he makes ron look like amateur hour .
all right , i got it .
once he finds the diamonds ,
he &apos;s not gonna need steve or lucy .
okay , you keep going .
i &apos;ll catch up with you .
all right .
get up .

i had some technical difficulties .
i missed my jump window .
look at my leg .
how the hell did you miss the jump ?
the pilot tried to stop me ,
so i had to throw the bag out of the airplane ,
and then i had to fight the pilot .
but it doesn &apos;t matter .
&apos;cause we got the goods . no problem .
no problem ?
i &apos;m looking at two problems right here .
well , okay .
