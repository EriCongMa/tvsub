callie ! callie ! callie !
the brain is the human body &apos;s most mysterious organ .
it learns ...
it changes ...
and it adapts .
it tells us what we see ...
what we hear .
it lets us feel love .
i think it holds our soul .
callie ! oh , callie ! help !
help ! somebody call 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 ! help ! oh ! oh , no .
what should we--
go ! help me ! help ! i need an ambulance ...
but now matter how much research we do ...
no one can really say how all the delicate gray matter
inside our skull works .
and when it &apos;s hurt ...
when the human brain is traumatized ...
well ...
that &apos;s when it gets even more mysterious .

no , nothing else .
these are dr. burke &apos;s ex @-@ patients .
both stab wounds to the chest ,
both presented after their initial surgeries with d.o.e ..
now he fixed both of them percutaneously ,
which drastically reduces the amount of heparin needed .
so we could avoid the brain rebleeding ,
and we don &apos;t need hypothermia ,
so the baby would have a better chance--
callie has a cardiac contusion , not penetrating trauma .
this is different .
yeah , but i read cases where it worked in blunt trauma .
well , i have seen every cardiac structure sheared off
by the wire in the loop in that procedure .
dr. burke uses a technique
that doesn &apos;t require the formation of a loop .
by placing an extra @-@ stiff wire
deep into the pulmonary artery ,
we avoided that complication .
even if that &apos;s the case ,
there &apos;s embolization and hemolysis--
which all could be avoided
with a meticulous delivery technique .
it &apos;s genius .
no .
what ?
i &apos;m saying no . it &apos;s too risky in this case .
the chances that we could puncture her heart are too high .
no , i did the surgery with burke .
i mean , he taught me .
if you &apos;re unfamiliar with the technique ,
i can show you operative reports .
this discussion is over .
owen ?
i am head of cardio , not your husband .
i am not asking my husband .

we &apos;ve done everything we can .
now we just have to wait for her to wake up .
but the fact that she barely responded
when you weaned her off the paralytics before ?
could mean she wasn &apos;t ready to wake up .
or ?
or it could mean her brain has been compromised ,
and she &apos;s not going to wake up .
you &apos;re not nothing .
we have a kid together .
you &apos;re a mom .
i &apos;m a dad .
i &apos;m sorry .
she &apos;s gonna wake up .

yesterday at the baby shower ...
i was jealous of callie
because e got pregnant ...
without trying .
and we try .
i get shots , i take my temperature ,
i put my legs in the air , and nothing .
the universe says &quot; screw you , meredith , &quot;
and gives callie a kid ...
and then puts callie through a windshield .
i mean , what the hell is going on ?
what &apos;s the point ?
i mean , is there a reason for this ?
because if you can think of a reason ,
any reason at all ,
why the universe is so screwed up ...
and random and mean ,
now would be an amazingly good time to tell me ,
because i really need some answers .
i know . i know . i know . come here .
i know .
listen ...
i will make sure we have a baby . i promise you .
one way or another ,
you and i will be parents . i promise you .
