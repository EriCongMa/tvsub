Anyone recognize these faces?
Victims of the Footpath Killer.
That's what Virginia newspapers are calling him.
We refer to him as the "unknown subject" or "unsub."
I told Virginia P.D.,
Who owns an american-made truck,
works a menial job.
I told 'em when you find him,
Have a n-i-- n-nice day.
The gun.
Ta-- take out the gun.
Who-- who are y--
who are you?
Who are you?!
FBI.
T-- t-- t--
take out your w-- your w-- wallet.
Wh-- what--
what do you kn--
what do you know?
About you?
I know a lot about you.
I know how you do it.
I know you can't stop.
And I know something that no one's ever been able to tell you.
I know why you stutter.
I was a lot worried.
But how did you find him?
I was just stopping for gas.
"There are certain clues at a crime scene which,
By their very nature,
Do not lend themselves to being collected or examined.
How does one collect love,
rage, hatred, fear?"
These are things that we're trained to look for.
So anyone else would have just seen a guy who stutters,
but you saw the Footpath Killer.
Right.
because of a parking ticket.
This is true.
This is also a good time to stop.
Okay, I'm curious.
Why'd he stutter?
You tell me.
Check. Checkmate 3 moves.
What...
You know you'll beat him when you start learning.
The Footpath Killer, why did he stutter?
He wants us to figure it out.
Okay. I'm up for a challenge.
Good, because these go to you.
Highest number of solved cases in Seattle 3 years running,
Specialty in sex offender cases.
Not bad.
Well, I'm the unit liaison.
My specialty is untangling bureaucratic knots.
Mostly because I'm never in my office,
So just call me on my cell, okay? We'll talk.
Did you watch it?
Yeah. Think everybody should see it.
BAU team, can you meet me in the conference room, please?
I need to show you something.
This is from the Phoenix office,
Who recorded it?
A student with a digital camcorder.
He was watching a fire in the building across from their dorm.
The building's on fire. Bro, you getting this?
Is that the kid?
Yeah, that's him.
Dude, over here. Check this out. What is it?
I don't know, but it's coming underneath the door.
Is someone in the hallway? Hey, someone's trying to get in.
Hey, man, you should get away from there.
Oh, my god! It smells like gas.
Oh, god! God! Oh, my god! Oh, my god!
Put me out! Oh, my god! Oh, god! Help!
Einstein once said:
"Imagination is more important than knowledge.
Knowledge is limited.
Imagination encircles the world."
Loss of job, loss of love.
When was the first fire set?
March. Uh, the next one was in may,
And the third one wasn't till september,
Then 2 weeks later there were 3 in one night.
82% are white males between 17 and 27.
Sounds like our boy's a student.
Don't be so sure.
If he went from setting one fire to 3 in 2 weeks' time...
rapid escalation.
The power over life and death.
Who we talking to first?
Dean of students, Ellen Turner.
[坦普市 纳利桑那州]
No badges.
by letting him know he got the FBI here.
Try not to look official.
Try to look less official.
Obviously, I'd rather be meeting you under different circumstances.
This is fire inspector Zhang.
This morning the chemistry department reported
several bottles of highly flammable chemicals missing.
I'm prepared to evacuate this campus. Thank you.
That brings with it its own problems.
You might evacuate the arsonist as well.
Then the case goes unsolved, the campus is reopened,
but the fires start up again.
Hotch, Gideon, hold on a second.
You said the chemicals were missing today.
It says here that one of the previous fires
was set with diesel fuel that disappeared from the grounds keeping facility.
How long after it disappeared was the fire set?
One day.
If he's holding to a pattern...
Who's to say the next fire won't be today?
Door was locked.
But the unsub couldn't get in.
So he pours the accelerant into the room from the hallway.
Which means he couldn't see the fire.
But he could hear Matthew Rowland screaming.
But we do know from precedent that
Sex and power.
But a serial arsonist wouldn't just set a fire and walk away.
He needs to experience it.
So why would he set a fire he couldn't watch?
He turned the water off just before the fire.
The last 3 were set with these.
2 devices, simultaneous ignition.
There was no device used on Matthew Rowland.
Unsub set that one manually?
Not necessarily.
Well, if the target was Matthew Rowland,
Then why set the other 2 fires?
The motives for arson are relatively simple.
There's vandalism, crime concealment, political statement...
We interviewed Matthew Rowland's roommate.
He said Matthew was very well-liked.
No. The fires are too sophisticated,
and if he's trying to make a political statement,
he's not being too clear about it.
There's an underlying strategy in this case.
Matthew, firefighters, injured victims.
they're objects.
Exactly.
All right... I want to set a dormitory fire.
Where would I start?
In the basement.
The upper levels would be fuel.
Then why did I start on the third floor?
Oh, god!
Because it wasn't the building I wanted to set on fire.
The timer sets the road flare,
Yet sophisticated in its simplicity.
Could also mean chemistry professor.
Mmm, I say student.
Full of 30 college kids.
Arsonists are socially incompetent.
This guy doesn't go on dates.
He doesn't go to parties. He doesn't feel comfortable in front of groups.
And, of course, he's a total psychopath.
Course.
No.
If you don't mind my asking,
why then did you set up the number?
Well, serial arsonists enjoy manipulating authorities.
They like to communicate, explain themselves.
I'm not waiting to hear from a tipster or witness.
because the exits out of the campus block so quickly.
agent Gideon?
Agent Gideon. Agent Gideon?
Everybody out of the building! Go!
What is it?
Look out! Clear the whole building! Clear it! Now!
Come on! Help me! Help me!
Get off of me! There was a teacher!
Let it go! He's already dead.
Let it go.
He might be here watching.
You got it.
The professor's name was Wallace?
Um... he knew how to make a difference.
How long will it take to finish evacuating the campus?
Well, there's another problem with evacuating.
Let's round everybody up.
Dean Turner? Hi, I'm Jeremy.
I'm one of the research assistants at the science department.
We were talking, and, uh, we'd like to help.
The best thing you can do right now is just stay--
we know how he did it.
Look at these expressions.
We got fear, a touch of horror,
even a little bit of panic.
Where's the guy gettin' off?
"I am devoted to fire. Fire is my master."
Okay, so who was our boy's master?
10,000 plus students...
and one has a serious fascination with fire.
Fire starting is one third of the homicidal triad...
an early predictor of adult disassociative criminal behavior.
Bedwetting... and cruelty to animals.
It's just the standard profile of a serial arsonist.
Based on hundreds of interviews.
Based on precedent.
We're off the mark.
Because of the 2 missing elements.
And without 'em, we do not have a profile.
Uh, sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.
I'm just, um, I'm campus patrol.
I'm supposed to ask for your I.D.
Sure, sure.
You're one of those FBI guys.
Like a profiler, right?
Like, one look at a crime scene,
you can tell what kind of shampoo a killer uses?
You sound skeptical.
Uh, maybe a little.
Your girlfriend thinks you're gonna break up with her.
You're kidding, right?
Well, you keep adjusting your necklace.
That tells me you're not used to wearing one
Take care of yourself, all right?
Reid. Since you're more their age,
why don't you do the talking?
Ahem. Hi-- hi, guys. Uh, my name's, uh, Dr. Spencer Reid.
I'm a, uh, agent with the-- the BAU,
the Behavioral Analysis Unit of the FBI,
which, um, it used to be called the BSU, the Behavioral Science Unit,
which is also part of this thing called the CIRG,
the Critical Incident Response Group, and--
May I, please? Thank you.
See this? Drill a hole in the side,
fill it with gasoline or whatever's good and flammable.
Turn the light on. Boom.
That is what went down, didn't it?
The stuff's all over the net.
Potassium, sulfur...
and normal sugar.
Sugar-- sugar, which is--
not exactly plutonium.
You could get this stuff anywhere.
Sugar from the supermarket.
But you don't need to be a chem major to know that.
Do you think it's a chem student?
You wanna know what I think?
Hold on.
So what are you still doin' here?
I can't leave. We got projects.
You know how to solve the 3 Body Problem?
Do you have any idea how many people called me today
with absolute certainty that our arsonist is a firefighter?
This came into the hotline about 5 minutes ago.
"Karen. I do this for Karen."
The call came from the office right next to Wallace's
5 minutes before the fire was started.
Play it again.
"Karen. I do this for Karen."
What is it?
I'm not sure. Somethin' about it.
Is this tape clean?
I can put it through some audio filters.
Look, we need as close to the real voice as you can get,
and anything that might be in the background. Can you do it?
Ok, you know how on Star Trek
and McCoy says, "damn it, Jim,
I'm a doctor, not a miracle worker?"
Hey, what are you tellin' me, not to expect a miracle?
No, I'm saying I'm not a doctor.
That's my girl.
These are all the women on campus with the first name Karen.
A lot of Karens. Hmm.
No, he's not done yet.
He's not goin' anywhere.
Keep thinkin'.
You mean, out--outside the box?
That's what Morgan's always telling me.
Well, he's probably right.
The standard profile of a serial arsonist.
What you don't know. The unknown.
Sometimes you have to get creative.
Even if you think it's utterly unlikely,
Thank you, Karen.
Karen number 7.
How about we just change the first question to
Nope. You?
I know that embarrassment makes a stutter worse,
and that when you're flustered,
it's more difficult to control the articulatory musculature of the face.
You sound like Reid.
You did not just say that.
Obviously, somebody's been doin' their homework.
I still have no idea what causes a stutter.
Karen. Number 8.
Hey. I didn't scare you again, did I?
Just lookin' at the board.
The 3 Body Problem.
You know what it means?
Uh, no. No idea.
It's physics. It's one of the great mathematical mysteries.
You broke up with her. No more necklace.
Yeah, I kinda wanna date someone else.
Oh. Well, that's, uh...
that's a pretty good reason.
Yeah, other than telling me that homosexuality's a sin,
and that I'm going to incur the wrath of God.
The wrath of god.
Garcia, what the hell is Ka-rown?
Most definitely, sweetness... with Reid.
Bye. Hey, Reid.
Garcia says it's not "Karen."
The motive is now religious?
and christians worship god as a consuming fire.
Okay, so we're lookin' for a theology major.
Maybe he's punishing the other students for their sins.
I don't want this.
No, 'cause that's not consistent with the previous targets.
What about the idea of baptism by fire?
We are running out of time.
Compulsion.
This is crazy. Hey, Mac, get over here.
Dude, over here. Check this out. What is it?
I don't know, but it's coming underneath the door.
Is someone in the hallway? Hey, someone's trying to get in.
Hey, man, you should get away from there.
Oh, my god. It smells like gas.
Help! Oh, my god! Oh, my god!
Hold on, man!
Outside the box.
Keep thinkin'. It's like chess.
You gotta see this the building's on fire.
There's always fires during rush week.
Dude, over here. Check this out. What is it?
Dude, over here. Check this out. What is it?
I don't know.
There's always fires during rush week.
3 times.
3 Professor Wallace
"Professor Wallace. Tuesday, 3:00."
I know why the profiles never fit.
The fires thus far have been completely task oriented.
So once they're set, the unsub is done?
obsessive compulsive disorder.
He does everything in 3's,
There's a form of OCD called scrupulosity.
Religious obsession and compulsion.
An obsessive fear of committing sin,
which creates so much anxiety that he's compelled
to do something to ease that anxiety.
Like setting fires.
All right. Remember the night of the 3 fires?
We saw the doorknob turning against the lock.
Well, what about the fires?
The first ones were single fires.
They were in 3's. A trinity of 3's.
The first fire occurred on March third.
3:00 P.M., third day, third month.
It's that convergence of 3's that causes the overwhelming anxiety.
Obsessive compulsives ease the anxiety by performing the compulsion.
Office number 3.
Third day of the week.
Matthew Rowland was in that class.
It was his third class of the day.
because our minds are incredibly adept at seeking out patterns.
But to the unsub, once that pattern hits,
bam-- he sets a fire.
But if the target was always people,
They were failures.
Up until Matthew Rowland.
What is it?
I think I know who it might be.
And it's not a he. It's a she.
Clara Hayes.
A chemistry student.
I'll get you her records now.
First get campus security out and find her.
She could set her next fire within hours.
Okay, got it. Her apartment's off campus.
But how is he sure it's this girl?
When I was talking to her and her classmates,
I noticed something-- a ring on her finger. And she kept turning it.
And she counted off the ingredients of a light bulb bomb.
Potassium, sulfur,
and normal sugar.
Sugar. Sugar.
And the word "sugar."
The 3 Body Problem.
No one in here.
I'm thinking more like OMG.
Deuteronomy.
That's the greek mythological Ferryman of the dead.
It's also the name of Pluto's only moon.
Paradise lost.
"Moloch, horrid king,
Moloch was the demon sun God of the Canaanites.
In order to keep from incurring his wrath,
16-year-old survives inferno.
The mother Ellen Hayes called it a miracle.
"My daughter was tested by God.
Look at the house number.
333.
Hey, Morgan,
you know what magical thinking is?
Obsessive thoughts.
It's like a superstition. It controls them.
Except she actually believes it.
God tested her with fire,
and now when three 3's--
three 3's show up around another person...
God tells her to test them.
Security's checking the science building.
Well, where else would she be?
We need to find the next pattern of 3's.
Hey, Hotch... we're lookin', man.
I don't think she would have left behind a day planner
that says "set next fire here" written in it.
Uh, Morgan?
I'll call you back.
There must be 30 homemade bombs in here.
We need to send our people into every building
A map of the campus.
Where's the blueprint?
Hell no, I'm not leaving.
I have too much to do. All right.
I bought one of those mini halon fire extinguishers.
They started selling them at the bookstore.
It's pretty morbid, right?
Hey, I'm about to get into an elevator,
so I'll probably lose you.
All right, bye-bye.
You got the science building?
It's not gonna start.
Don't you have the key?
I put it back on the hook in the office.
Aren't you supposed to be able to hear the emergency call button?
Maybe it's broken.
Or turned off.
I say we pry open the doors.
You can't pry 'em all the way open.
It's a safety precaution.
Maybe we can try yelling for help.
That's the fire alarm.
Jason, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Clara Hayes is very likely a good person.
Someone who never wanted to do anyone any harm,
like any other rational person.
Research suggests OCD involves problems
What are you trying to say?
Help! Somebody help us!
Hello? Somebody help us!
It's all right.
It's okay. I'm here to save you.
Not yet.
It's clear up here. Anything?
Nothing.
No girl, no smoke, no fire.
Where did she go?
Maybe she's getting the key.
I don't know.
Clara?
Father, son...
Oh, my god!
It's gasoline!
Stop it, Clara! Listen!
The guards made sure all floors are empty
and no elevators are in service. Hold on.
Clara?
Put it down, Clara!
She's failing out. This was gonna be her last semester.
That's the stressor. What else?
She was a researcher in the science building.
We know that. They've already cleared the science building.
The third floor of the science building is under construction.
I'm on my way.
Clara.
I have to do this.
You know it's not rational, Clara.
You were trying to tell me.
God chose me to be tested,
something terrible will happen.
What's gonna happen, Clara?
I know. I know. I know.
Then resist.
I can't.
You left the message about Charon.
You want to stop.
Father, son...
Clara...
God chose them.
Get us out of here.
He said he was just trying to stall Clara.
Right.
You were just trying to stall him.
You were stalling.
I don't?
I looked it up. No one does.
There are some theories about a neurological basis.
But they're just theories.
What really happened in the convenience store?
I know how to provoke one.
The key.
13.
We only found 6.
I didn't know you could count.
Our profile said you'd be too stupid.
You-- y-- yo-
What?
Th-- th-- the cam--
I don't know what you're trying to say.
You take the cam--
the cam-- the c-- the cam--
Say it.
The ca--
Just spit it out. Just...
The cam--
Come on!
Faulkner once said,
"Don't bother just to be better
than your contemporaries or predecessors.
Try to be better than yourself."
Check in 3.
Not bad.
Checkmate.
Don't worry, you're gettin' there.
