certainly nothing for you to worry about .
&quot; manager dale . &quot; welcome to the neighborhood .
we &apos;re from the north ward merchants protective cooperative .
i &apos;m kinda busy . you guys looking for a donation ?
let him finish .
you may have noticed
not to denigrate anyone but this is a transitional neighborhood .
i mean demographically speaking you still have a lot of marginal types .
we merchants have found you really should
have some round @-@ the @-@ clock security here .
isn &apos;t that what the police are for ?
they do their best
but they got their hands full .
your weekly dues to us will give you all the supplemental
safety net you &apos;ll ever need .
i can &apos;t authorize anything like that .
it have to go through corporate in seattle .
we merchants prefer to deal on a personal one @-@ on @-@ one basis .
i don &apos;t have any discretionary funds .
it &apos;s gotta go through corporate .
how do you think corporate would feel if for the sake of argument
someone threw a brick through your window ?
they &apos;ve got 10.000 stores in north america .
i don &apos;t think they &apos;d feel anything .
what if god forbid it wasn &apos;t just vandalism ?
what if an employee
even the manager say was assaulted ?
look every last fucking coffee bean
is in the computer and has to be accounted for .
the numbers don &apos;t add up i &apos;ll be gone and somebody else will be here .
it &apos;s over for the little guy .
vince good morning . how &apos;s your book coming ?
okay .
you &apos;re always welcome to join the other guests for breakfast .
thad says if your dishwasher is newer than five years
you don &apos;t need to use the pre @-@ rinse cycle .
the fact is i don &apos;t recommend it . it can trick the sensors
into thinking that the dishes are cleaner than they really are .
i gotta go write . thanks .
morning .
jason masucci was down in tampa visiting his mother
thought he saw vito in a jenny craig .
turned out to be some other fat piece of shit .
if that fag ever does come back
we should have carlo do it .
be good with all the crews .
excuse me ? you were all hot to trot .
i got enough complications in my life .
feds up my ass .
for business reasons okay
but for political correctness ?
ooh check it out .
i could do that no problem .
wait here . i &apos;ll get your viagra .
let me tell you something for two months after the shooting
as far as snatch was concerned
didn &apos;t even have a hard @-@ on when i woke up in the morning .
like sil . bullet didn &apos;t fuck with the plumbing though .
no no thank god .
it &apos;s just the effects of the physical trauma .
doc said it was part of the healing process .
i must be healed now because i got a baguette
in my pants now 24 / 7 .
affirmation of life .
hey she &apos;s coming this way .
put money in the meter or something .
anthony soprano .
yeah .
julianna skiff
century 21 . you got a minute ?
sure .
cannoli ?
no thank you .
you own the building at 217 franklin right around the corner
currently occupied by caputo live poultry .
i represent the jamba juice company .
they &apos;re interested in purchasing the property .
jamba juice ...
wants to put a store in around here ?
well you must have noticed the area &apos;s on an upswing .
you know the old glove factory across the park
over by the cathedral beautiful renovation .
i just bought a loft there myself .
person like yourself &apos;s a wonderful addition to the neighborhood .
jamba juice is willing to pay $ 175 a square foot .
public records show the building at 1,800 square feet .
so that makes a purchase price of $ 315,000 .
you ever buy eggs from caputo ?
frankly i &apos;m not wild about the smell in there .
let me tell ya his eggs taste 10 times better
than any of the ones you get in the supermarket .
chickens too .
businesses relocate all the time .
no this would be a real loss for the neighborhood .
don &apos;t you live out in north caldwell ?
yeah my family made the trek up guinea gulch .
bloomfield avenue .
but my roots here go way back .
my grandfather came from avellino like most of the people around here
and i grew up right over there . my father was an early community leader .
mm @-@ hmm .
how about you ? where &apos;re you from ?
upstate new york .
binghamton .
how &apos;d you wind up here ?
my parents have a catering business
something to leave to the kids right ?
only i didn &apos;t see myself making salisbury steak for the next 30 years .
so i left home at 17 .
rebellious .
just a low tolerance for boredom .
so ... interested not interested ?
i &apos;m interested .
but as far as the property &apos;s concerned
175 a square foot &apos;s a little low .
and ...
i don &apos;t wanna sell out from under the guy .
good morning vince .
the usual ?
been dreaming of those johnnycakes .
can &apos;t beat jim &apos;s johnnycakes .
i saw you at the fire last night .
you got balls my friend .
you don &apos;t get paid for that right ?
we &apos;re all volunteers .
back where i come from you join the fire department
to steal shit from people &apos;s bedrooms .
how &apos;s the book coming ?
it &apos;s fucking slow today .
writer &apos;s block huh ?
let &apos;s just say i like eating a lot more than writing .
and you don &apos;t help any .
everything you make is fucking delicious .
you know ...
i don &apos;t know how you do it .
i can &apos;t even write a letter .
i saw graziano fight sugar ray in 1952 .
i took a train to chicago .
maybe you should interview me .
maybe i will .
i thought you were writing a book about rocky marciano .
well you can &apos;t talk about one without the other .
marciano
now that was a tragic death .
now what was the year he fought joe louis ... &apos; 49 ?
yeah .
actually i think it was &apos; 51 .
when you told me you were writing a book
i looked him up on the internet .
i don &apos;t know where my fucking head is today .
maybe you &apos;re working too hard .
yeah .
it must be lonely sometimes being a writer .
you get used to it .
hey dad i left my science project in the back .
don &apos;t lose my glue gun .
hey mrs. conte . come sta &apos; ?
how &apos;s the hip ?
hey anthony . i need your help .
what ?
those nigger fucking whores
they play that music so loud .
now that &apos;s not nice . those are puerto ricans mrs. conte .
i ask &apos; em nice to turn it down .
they tell me to go fuck myself .
i &apos;ll see what i can do .
thanks .
hey how &apos;s junior ?
tell him i said hello .
yeah .
you know i been meaning to ask you
chicken or the egg ? you wanna weigh in ?
that same stupid joke huh ?
how are you ?
good good .
so how &apos;s business ? mezzo mezz &apos; ?
believe it or not better than ever .
glad to hear it .
i &apos;ll have to raise your rent .
see when you hold your knife with your blade
facing your opponent you got a lot better control .
plus you protect the forearm .
no if you got the tip pointing at him you get more distance .
you could swipe his abdomen and fucking gut him .
see that &apos;s stupid . look how your range of motion is limited .
it &apos;s so easy for him to step back grab your fucking arm
take your knife away .
could someone please check us out ?
yo hernan .
sure what time ?
cool .
no problem . i can cover tonight .
i &apos;m totally fucking minted . later .
yeah ?
i &apos;m at work . what do you think ?
he stepped on a nail ?
fuck .
how far did it go in ?
fuck !
would you mind ?
i better call you back . bye .
that was hernan ?
he was such a dick in high school .
well he was a senior . what do you expect ?
they always shit on the underclassmen .
the kid spends
every night in some fucking club in new york
sleeps till noon puts in a couple hours at blockbuster
and that &apos;s it .
and since my injury like i told you
i &apos;ve been more you know ...
accepting . be grateful for what you got .
but maybe that &apos;s wrong . maybe i should be on the kid .
my dad would have kicked my lazy ass out of the house .
really ?
it &apos;s the chopping off of the guy &apos;s finger right ?
i never should have told you &apos; cause that &apos;s all you fixate on with him .
can you empathize with aj at that age ?
yeah i had some problems at school
but i didn &apos;t vegetate .
what ?
these are different times .
people today are bombarded with so much information
so much input of every kind .
consequently true adulthood is delayed .
sociologists say that 26
is in fact the new 21 .
and the new 26 is what ?
i &apos;m 46 so that means i &apos;m what 35 ?
my father isn &apos;t an old man .
it &apos;s ridiculous to let himself disintegrate like this .
how &apos;s it going with patient soprano ?
what ?
i &apos;m talking about my father elliot .
i thought you were done .
it happens too often .
i think that &apos;s a non @-@ sequitur accusation .
why don &apos;t you just admit he &apos;s a gangster ?
he was gunned down and you &apos;re into it on a tabloid level .
you devoted quite a chunk of last visit to him .
i &apos;m responding to that .
nothing &apos;s changed okay ?
he refuses to really engage on this trauma the uncle caused .
and i think it &apos;s just a matter of time
before he totally decompensates .
has he cried or reported crying
at all about this man buster ?
junior no .
hmm .
this omerta concept
comes from a pre @-@ therapeutic culture .
this isn &apos;t omerta .
it &apos;s something else .
hey man ... park it in the garage on 14th street
not the other shithole . watch for potholes .
what &apos;s going on man ?
how &apos;s it going ? good to see you .
his dad &apos;s really a gangster ?
what &apos;s that mean ?
how old are you ?
20 .
shut up .
15 .
how old are you ?
18 .
when i take e my feet get cold .
that ever happen to you ?
i wear special socks .
let &apos;s go uptown to my crib and get more twisted
if that &apos;s possible .
oh it &apos;s possible .
i could give you a massage .
yeah . yeah you could .
oh yeah all right .
we all good ?
yeah it &apos;s cool .
mr. soprano zasu said to tell you
he &apos;s honored to have you in the club .
and please regards to your dad .
okay .
oh yeah right .
what can i do for you phil ?
vito .
do we know where he &apos;s at ?
well that really doesn &apos;t concern you .
how &apos;s john ?
i don &apos;t know . fine through his vale of tears .
but seriously
vito what &apos;s being done about him ?
like i just said it &apos;s none of your fucking business
&apos;cause he works for me not you .
he &apos;s married to my cousin .
he dishonored me personally .
what do you want me to do put out an apb on the guy
&apos;cause he takes it up the ass huh ?
it &apos;s a victimless crime .
marie is a victim . her children are victims .
they &apos;ve done nothing .
and they &apos;re forced to live with the shame
and humiliation . i gotta be frank
in your father &apos;s day
we wouldn &apos;t be having this conversation .
a finook in his crew he knew how to handle that .
i sympathize with marie
and the children okay ?
but don &apos;t you fucking tell me what to do . you &apos;re only acting boss .
i swallowed my pride when your murdering fuck of a cousin
killed my brother .
don &apos;t think i &apos;m gonna do it twice .
phillip let &apos;s not make a beef where there isn &apos;t one .
fundamentally we are in agreement on this issue
but i &apos;ll handle it .
you know i saw you on tv
when your grandfather shot your dad .
and now we &apos;re like friends .
that &apos;s so weird .
right .
so what &apos;s gonna happen to him your grandfather i mean ?
he &apos;s my great @-@ uncle .
so isn &apos;t your dad gonna do something ?
you know the &quot; omerto &quot; ?
we don &apos;t talk about that with outsiders .
cool but i mean
he &apos;s not just gonna let him get away with it is he ?
i &apos;ll probably have to do something .
really ?
you &apos;re so intense .
you probably left it in the car thad .
no it was on the bedside table .
i was charging it .
you &apos;re always losing something .
last week it was the sunglasses .
he left them on the counter at the tcby .
what did you lose ?
cell phone .
i didn &apos;t lose it . i was charging the damn thing .
tell you what i do--try to retrace my steps .
it was on the bedside table .
hello .
hey it &apos;s me .
where are you ? who &apos;s thad mccone ?
some guy .
oh my god vito .
not that .
i &apos;m just borrowing his phone .
listen marie
i &apos;m sorry all this had to happen .
i never meant to hurt you .
come back vito . just come back .
it &apos;s a little more complicated than that .
please phil said it &apos;ll be all right .
we could get you help . we could get you psychiatric help .
phil ? i trust him least of all .
how can you say that ? he &apos;s family .
he loves you .
not anymore believe me .
but i &apos;ve been reading online
there are these church groups .
they could cure you of this .
marie well what are you gonna do never come home ?
i &apos;m working on that .
in the meantime you &apos;re gonna need some cash .
i need you vito . i need my husband .
listen to me in the den behind the elliptical trainer
the baseboard comes off .
there &apos;s 30k in there .
you know marie
you would like it here .
tell me where .
i &apos;ll bring the kids . we &apos;ll relocate .
i gotta go .
don &apos;t you wanna talk to frannie or little v ?
yeah okay .

mr. soprano .

how &apos;d you know to find me here ?
i &apos;m a real estate agent .
uh @-@ oh .
can i buy you a drink ?
uh sure .
ginger ale with lime juice please .
have a seat .
jamba juice upped their offer
225 a square foot .
i don &apos;t know .
how &apos;s this for an idea ?
they let you carry the note .
you won &apos;t get hammered on the taxes .
well that &apos;s an incentive
but the truth is i don &apos;t wanna sell .
you &apos;re a businessman are you not ?
as a businessman i gotta tell you
that in 10 years &apos; time that
property &apos;s gonna be worth twice as much as they &apos;re offering .
but you know it &apos;s not just the money .
you drive around america today
and everything looks the fucking same
old navy and bed bath and whatever .
but the north ward it &apos;s the north ward .
plus i got business interests there so ...
something like all immigrant groups love to gamble .
listen why don &apos;t ...
me and you go get some dinner ?
i have a boyfriend .
i &apos;m engaged .
i have a wife . i &apos;m married .
it &apos;s ... you know we &apos;re talking business .
you just said you don &apos;t wanna sell . what &apos;s there to discuss ?
truth is i &apos;m very attracted to you .
maybe you read in the papers that i got shot .
well julianna
that experience made me appreciate life .
it &apos;s short . it could end at any time
and if you &apos;ve got the chance to do something
that might make you happy
you should take it
you know like when you left binghamton .
you &apos;re very persuasive .
and in the past i might have jumped .
like i said i &apos;m engaged .
and things are going well .
i think for once in my life
i will exercise a little self @-@ control .
thanks for the drink .
guy sent this over .
i saw that guy in the field the other day .
when we were practicing dummy drag
he spent the whole time in the bleachers staring .
yeah ? vince come here .
join us .
he &apos;s a very funny guy . great sense of humor .
thanks for this .
thanks .
my pleasure .
we were talking about a call we had last month .
we were lucky the roof held .
did anyone hear that yma sumac scream
when the ceiling fan came down ? that was ron .
the goddamn thing almost killed me .
you would have screamed too you cunt .
fucking nancies . don &apos;t argue now .
you know guys
we &apos;ve got to get serious about the state muster next month .
last year hinsdale whipped our butt in that ladder carry .
what &apos;s that a deuce ?
fat boy .
chromed out the forks .
nice .
you ride ?
i always wanted a panhead . never happened .
you should get a bike .
out here when the leaves are changing
blasting down the daniel webster highway
there &apos;s nothing else like it .
yeah .
i bet .
you know i &apos;m glad you decided
to write your book in our little town .
what the fuck you doing ? what are you some kind of fag ?
guess i made a mistake .
you sure as fuck did .
listen closet queen you can &apos;t handle it don &apos;t sent out the signals .
dirty fighter huh ?
asshole .
see that ? you didn &apos;t even notice .
what ?
that salami--
40 % less fat and sodium .
you know ...
you &apos;re always looking out for me .
i &apos;m very lucky to have you .
mmm .
and don &apos;t you forget it .
hey prince albert you know what time it is ?
huh ?
these late nights are getting to be a real habit with you
aj . don &apos;t you have to work today ?
look i gotta talk to you guys .
i need new clothes . everything i have is so old .
you got money . you sold your drums .
and i need that money for living expenses .
what do you think clothes are ?
no i mean nice clothes not socks and underwear .
oh so you can go out to the clubs with fernando .
that kid is a creep .
hernan . and he &apos;s not a creep . he &apos;s my friend .
and i don &apos;t talk about your friends that way .
when they were in school
hernan &apos;s mother and i were on the faculty lunch committee .
hernan has a reading disability .
fuck that .
and we &apos;re not giving you any more money .
frankly aj i am a little concerned--
the clubs sleeping late
your lack of interest in anything productive .
hey i &apos;m interested in productive stuff
just not stuff you care about .
i could run one of those clubs .
what ?
look i &apos;m not just partying there . i &apos;m learning .
i see what works what doesn &apos;t .
i could have a great club
and really successful .
if you guys care so much about my future
then why don &apos;t you stake me ?
in a club ? get the hell out of here .
you pick up the garbage in a lot of clubs in new york .
you know people . you could help me
it &apos;s not like you can &apos;t afford to set me up . you have all the money in the world .
this is ridiculous . manage a club aj ?
you &apos;ve never even been a busboy .
if you wanna get back into event planning
you should think about the culinary institute in poughkeepsie .
culinary institute ? why do you keep talking about event planning ?
i don &apos;t even know what that is .
if you &apos;re serious i &apos;ll tell you what i &apos;ll do .
i &apos;ll get you a job at beansie &apos;s
and you can learn the business from the ground up .
that &apos;s a fucking pizza parlor not a club .
it &apos;s the service industry !
why are we even having this discussion ?
you &apos;re going back to college next semester .
see ? this is just what i mean .
you guys never give me any support in anything i wanna do .
aj !
oh !
god damn him .
this is fucking demoralizing .
maybe we should get him a club give him some responsibility .
maybe he &apos;ll rise to the occasion .
are you insane ? he &apos;s not even legal drinking age .
well yeah yeah .
it &apos;s like a ... bad smell in the house .
it &apos;s always hanging there .
more than that it &apos;s no good for me and carmela .
&apos;cause arguing with aj is no kind of aphrodisiac
i &apos;ll tell you that .
just when i was beginning to feel physically good again
like my old self .
good . i see .
but honestly
no one could blame a man for seeking an extracurricular outlet
in a situation like this .
don &apos;t give me that look .
you &apos;re always telling me that i &apos;m projecting .
you &apos;re projecting .
so you &apos;re not seeking an extracurricular outlet ?
no . i was just being theoretical .
what carmela did for me when i was hurt
the way she took care of me
nursed me back to health you think i wanna fucking betray that ?
ls it possible on some level
you blame her for aj &apos;s problems ?
look i don &apos;t know .
no . carmela &apos;s a good mother .
she did her best .
look could you just give me
some practical advice
for once ?
tell me what the fuck to do about my son ?
well ...
i think it &apos;s entirely appropriate
for you and carmela to tell aj .
you have certain expectations of him
particularly since he &apos;s living in your home .
the most important thing is
that you and carmela
are in agreement on the issues
that you don &apos;t undercut each other
or act at cross @-@ purposes .
here . so you can buy a suit
to look nice for job or college interviews .
this is not for fun . this is not to be used
for any kind of personal entertainment .
thanks .
hi .
hey mr. soprano . what &apos;s going on ?
welcome back .
hey what &apos;s up ? meet my friends .

including a queen post .

bullshit !
i mean it .
you &apos;re a good guy . i &apos;m very grateful .
well you &apos;re a fucking hypocrite
because every time we watch &quot; godfather &quot;
when michael corleone shoots those guys at the restaurant
those assholes who tried to kill his dad
you sit there with your fucking bowl of ice cream
and you say it &apos;s your favorite scene of all time !
jesus christ aj ...

jamba juice upped their offer to 275 a square foot .
