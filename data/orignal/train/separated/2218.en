You don't have to do this.
I just need more time.
Mr. Shioma has given you
over a month to make good on your debt.
Time's up.
I'd like to report two murders.
You can find the bodies in the Makua Kea'au Forest Reserve.
How do you know this?
'Cause I put them there.
Prosecutor's last and final offer was 18 months.
Okay.
We accepted.
Before you think of saying anything, know this,
I have people outside your house, right now,
and if they don't hear from me in exactly ten minutes,
she's dead.
What do you want?
Help me.
Thanks for coming, brah.
Yeah. Is Nahele all right?
Your text message said it was an emergency.
That's the emergency?
I-I was just following orders.
It is an emergency, bruddah.
If I don't get to Waikiki Food Fest within the hour,
Simmy's Shrimp Shack's gonna jump my spot.
An emergency is-is a life-or-death situation.
You understand that?
This is... this is a flat tire.
It's called an economic crisis.
An economic crisis?
If I don't sell shrimp, Nahele don't get paid.
Nahele don't get paid,
he looks for alternative sources of income,
which might directly impact your financial situation.
Is that right?
Trickle-down Economics, brah.
There's a jack in my truck in the toolbox.
What'd I tell you, kid?
Superman to the rescue.
McGarrett.
Kono, what do we know?
There was a chemical spill on the road outside Halawa Prison
that forced an emergency evacuation
to the Marine Corps barracks at Kaneohe Bay.
That's over a thousand inmates.
That's why they were using the city buses.
Yeah, Corrections ran out of vehicles,
so the Mayor commandeered these buses to help out.
On the way to the brig,
this one was hit with what appears to be a remote-controlled IED.
We got the exact casualty count?
Ten prisoners, one guard dead, dozens injured.
And then there's this guy.
Meet James Hamasaki.
This guy was doing time for weapons and drug trafficking.
Talk about unlucky.
By some miracle, this guy survives the blast,
only to be the unlucky recipient of a double tap.
Now, witnesses say that our shooter was stalking through
the wreckage just moments after the blast,
but nobody can give us enough information to get an I.D.
Okay, so wait a minute, you're telling me
that the chemical spill and the attack on this bus
was all part of a coordinated hit?
Yeah, I'm thinking
the shooter was just insurance to make sure the job got done.
Steve, we got runners.
Corrections identified six inmates unaccounted for,
and the guard's gun is missing.
So I guess we got armed runners.
What's the matter, Duke?
Kono, one of the fugitives is your husband.
All right, everybody, listen up.
We have the identities of the six escaped inmates.
We believe these men are still traveling together
and shackled in pairs.
We also have reason to believe
that one of them is armed with a handgun,
so look sharp when you're out there.
They are identified as: Gerard Burns, 61 years old.
This guy's convicted of first-degree murder
in the killing of his wife.
He's a former defense attorney
to some of the island's worst criminals.
Next up, Bobby Stockman.
This guy's a serial rapist, convicted.
Currently, he's done five years
of his 162-year sentence.
Now meet Efrin Aquino.
He's currently serving three life terms
for a triple homicide that happened back in 2002.
I'm sure most of you know this guy, Henry Garavito.
For those of you who haven't had the pleasure,
Mr. Garavito has spent the last 15 years of his life
in solitary confinement after slaughtering two families
and cannibalizing all of his victims.
We also have serial torch, Jason Duclair.
Duclair is currently serving multiple life sentences
for various counts of murder and arson.
That said, we are gonna have fire-fighting support,
helos standing by,
just in case he gets the itch while he's out there.
Lastly, we got Adam Noshimuri.
Mr. Noshimuri was housed in a protective-custody dormitory
right next to the maximum-security wing.
Now, somehow, he and some of his fellow inmates
were mixed up with the other max prisoners on that bus.
Please note that right now we believe Mr. Noshimuri
was forced to go along with the other fugitives.
Is that clear? Good.
SWAT is currently tied up helping Corrections
with the prison evac.
Aviation is up, but the K-9s are still 15 to 20 out.
We're not waiting for the dogs, all right?
We got to move.
These guys have got a big head start on us already.
If we want to catch them before the sun goes down,
we got to move right now, got it?
Kono.
All right, so the escapees were last seen headed north.
So far, they've avoided H-3 to the West,
which is already crawling with HPD checkpoints.
There are two other possible
escape-route scenarios based on distance and terrain.
There are some old, off-the-grid campsites
and hunting cabins in this area
where they could possibly obtain weapons and supplies,
or they could continue moving north
to the town of Ahuimanu and Highway 83.
Yeah, obviously this is a residential area.
We don't want the bad guys getting in there.
All right? Let's go.
Chin, what's up?
Hey, Steve.
Max's prelim on Hamasaki uncovered something very interesting.
This wasn't the first attempt on his life.
Apparently, he suffered a very serious stab wound
to the abdomen two months ago.
That explains why he was in protective custody, right?
Mm-hmm. Corrections is sending over the case file.
Let's look into anybody who had contact with him
inside or outside of that prison.
Already got Jerry on that.
Listen, Steve, there's something else you should know.
What?
Nahele's father was one of the inmates on the bus.
He didn't make it.
Does Nahele know?
No.
Thought you'd want to be the one to tell him.
All right.
Wait, there, there.
Everybody move.
Get under there!
You gonna pray for us to make it out of here alive?
No. I'm gonna give you something
to tie that bandage with.
Thank you.
We can't keep running around this jungle.
Here.
There's no way we're gonna get away from the cops,
not like this.
We need a plan.
Yeah, he's right.
They'll be up here with dogs soon.
If we don't get these shackles off,
we'll never stay ahead of them.
You know, I used to camp up here with my uncle when I was a kid.
If we keep heading north to higher ground,
we're gonna find some hunting cabins and campsites.
We'll find something to break these chains,
maybe food and water.
Sounds like the counselor here has got a plan.
Okay, let's move.
All right.
Get up.
Look, just give me a minute.
Get your ass up now,
or we're gonna break your neck and carry you.
If you let him stop the bleeding, he walks faster.
We all want that, right?
He's right.
Make it quick.
You guys keep moving. We'll catch up.
Okay, so the stabbing of Hamasaki happened in the prison
laundry room, away from cameras and guards.
There were four witnesses.
Conveniently, they all came down with a case of amnesia.
Ah. I'm guessing Hamasaki wouldn't I.D. his attacker.
No, snitches get stitches.
But here's where it gets weird.
In the weeks before the assault,
Hamasaki was visited over a dozen times by this guy.
He signed in as Reid Garner,
Hamasaki's attorney.
All right, what's weird about that?
There's no Reid Garner listed
as a licensed attorney in the great state of Hawaii.
So I ran him through facial rec,
and as you may have guessed,
his name is not Reid Garner, and he's not an attorney.
Then who the hell is he?
Gentlemen.
Special Agent Ed Scanlon. How can I help you?
We need to know about the case you're working
with James Hamasaki.
He was cooperating in a federal RICO case
targeting one of his former associates,
uh, Anthony Palumbo.
James was supposed to testify against him
in a federal grand jury last week.
He got cold feet and bailed at the last minute.
I'm sure the sharp instrument
inserted into his ribs contributed to that decision.
Hamasaki was killed this morning
on his way from Halawa Prison
to the Marine barracks at Kaneohe Bay.
That IED attack on the corrections bus?
We think he was the target.
But it's strange that Palumbo would take him out
knowing he decided not to testify.
So who put the hit on Hamasaki?
What was that look?
Was that a look?
Yeah.
Oh, I was just wondering why the man with...
the man with a thousand opinions
has suddenly turned into a Buddhist monk.
You haven't said two words since we left the command post.
Well, maybe that's because I don't have anything to say.
Oh, really?
Yeah, really.
Maybe you know I'm not gonna like
what you have to say.
All right, let me ask you a question.
I understand, okay?
I understand Adam is shackled to Duclair
and he had no choice, but what if he did?
What if he was using this as an opportunity to run?
Why would he turn himself in
and take a plea deal if he's just gonna run?
Doesn't make any sense.
Okay, I'll tell you why.
Maybe... maybe it has something to do
with the fact that he had a sit-down with Gabriel Waincroft,
didn't tell anybody, not even Kono,
until he was asked about it. How about that?
He's got 14 months left on his sentence, okay?
He's not gonna throw that away for a fugitive play.
Besides, he wouldn't do that to Kono.
Oh, no?
I understand that once you are a criminal,
you are always a criminal.
Old life calls, okay?
Need a little help carrying the weight of the world
on your shoulders there, Atlas?
I'm just thinking about Adam.
Adam had to run. He didn't have a choice.
Come on, you know that, don't you?
I do, and then my mind starts
wandering into all that stuff with Gabriel and then I don't.
Well, let me give you a little advice.
Follow your first instinct. Your husband's a good guy.
I know that and you know that, too, more importantly.
He was protecting you by leaving you out of the loop,
and now he's doing what he's got to do to stay alive
and protecting himself.
It's just that simple.
So... I did some digging into Hamasaki,
and check this out.
You recognize this guy?
Yeah. Solomon Tuasopo.
He's the guard that let Gabriel into Halawa to visit Adam.
What's he got to do with Hamasaki?
Nothing.
But he was also the guard
assigned to special holding this morning.
He put Adam and some other protective custody inmates
on a bus with prisoners from maximum security.
According to Halawa Chief of Security,
that should never have happened.
Okay. Where are you going with this, Jer?
I have a theory, if you don't mind.
Who does this look like to you?
Our victim Hamasaki.
Right. But who else does it look like?
I don't know. Who?
I'll give you a hint.
They could pass as brothers, right?
I guess, yeah.
Which leads me to my theory.
With all the chaos,
the smoke, the fire, blood everywhere,
same striped jumpsuits, same physical appearance...
Hamasaki wasn't the target.
It was Adam.
Chin, are you sure they were trying to kill Adam?
It's the only theory that makes any sense right now.
We're bringing Tuasopo in.
He's the guard that put Adam on the bus.
I want to know who paid him to do it.
That's easy.
It was Waincroft.
He crawled out from under his rock
and he's orchestrating the whole damn thing.
Yeah, well, if Gabriel's behind it,
obviously Adam turned down his offer to partner up.
No way it was Gabriel.
Last time we saw this guy,
he's doing a gainer out of a window.
He bounced off a car hood.
He's half dead, he's got no money;
he ain't putting a hit on anybody.
Okay. Well, it's not Gabriel,
who wants Adam dead?
McGarrett!
Chin, I got to call you back.
Look at this.
Look at all this blood.
At least one of these guys is hurt bad.
Guys, I got something over here.
This is the prayer beads off of Adam's necklace.
It must've broken.
Guys.
Got fresh tracks over here. They split up.
You got a house on the North Shore.
You got two kids in private school.
Either you really know how to stretch
that state correctional buck,
or you're on somebody's payroll.
You know what I learned
from talking to people like you, Solomon?
That even the worst men who have sat in that chair...
they all have someone they care about.
Someone they love.
Now, for you...
you got two boys at the Iolani School, right?
That's 40 grand a year in tuition.
That's... that's a lot of love.
For me, it's Kono.
I mean, you know, she's like the sister I never had.
But maybe you didn't know
that the man you had set up to be killed this morning
is her husband.
That makes him 'ohana.
And that makes this very, very personal.
So if you ever want to
see your children again without
a piece of glass and a telephone between you and them,
you're gonna tell me who paid you
to put Adam Noshimuri on that bus.
Where are Garavito and Aquino?
They should've caught up to us by now.
Maybe the cops grabbed them.
Who cares?
All they did was slow us down anyway.
All right.
Hold still.
Forget it.
That's not gonna cut through cold steel.
You got a better idea?
Yeah.
Heat up the chain, make it softer.
This is priceless.
The pyro wants to start a fire.
Does anyone else think that's, like, a really bad idea?
Look, the man's right.
The cops will see the smoke.
Not if we build the fire upside down.
Of course. An upside-down fire.
I mean, why didn't I think of that?
Everybody on your heads.
Be smart.
Shut up.
Gather up the bigger logs.
Start with those.
Smaller logs on top,
kindling on top of that.
This way, the fire burns down instead of up.
The heat on top
eats up all the gases from underneath.
Trust me.
Tuasopo's more afraid of
whoever's paying him than he is of going to jail.
He's not talking.
Well, his money definitely is.
I found large deposits
into accounts under his wife's maiden name.
Only problem is, there's no connection
to who we thought was behind this,
Gabriel Waincroft.
The money was wired from offshore accounts
科乐美·艾兰娜 当前所有转账记录
controlled by the man he murdered,
late Yakuza boss Goro Shioma.
So whoever filled Shioma's shoes
is the one who ordered the hit on Adam.
Let's get on with this. My hand is on fire!
Not yet.
I'd rather keep the chain than lose the hand!
Okay, over there.
Go!
Well, I guess I owe you an apology.
I just want you to stay out of my face.
That's all I want.
Where's Aquino?
We got lost.
Cut across a stream and he slipped on a rock.
Cracked his head wide open. It was real bad.
Blood everywhere.
He quit breathing.
How'd you get the chain off?
I had no choice.
You sick son of a bitch!
I did what I had to do.
Get back!
Easy. Come on.
There's nothing we can do about it now.
I did what I had to do.
I can walk 18 holes on a golf course, not blink an eye.
I'm lying. I take a cart every time.
What I'm trying to say is
this hiking is kicking my ass.
Well, I guess it is better than walking a beat in Chicago
on Rush Street in the middle of winter.
I do not miss that. I tell you what.
Waking up in double digits below zero.
Weather forecast for the day is:
popsicle toes.
I can't feel my face.
I don't know.
I could do with a little cold weather right now.
Kono.
I see it.
I got blood and drag marks.
What is this?
Hang on. What is this?
Oh, it's a body.
It's Aquino.
Yeah.
I guess Garavito prefers his own company.
Hang on.
Where is his hand?
It's over here.
Gentlemen, as much as I've enjoyed the company,
think I'm gonna head out on my own.
Splitting up will only increase our chances of getting caught.
No one's asking your opinion.
The man's right.
We should stay together
until we get to the highway.
The man eats people.
I think that disqualifies him as someone we should listen to.
This guy turned himself in the last time he escaped.
He doesn't care if he gets caught.
The cops grab him,
he's liable to tell them which way we're headed.
We can't let him go.
Who's gonna stop me? You?
I am.
Give him the hatchet.
Keep that handy.
I'm gonna need it later when I kill you.
Shoot him!
Blow his damn brains out!
This guy is a liability!
All right, shut up!
No one's killing anyone.
Put the gun down.
Everybody, just take a deep breath.
Give me the gun!
I'll do it!
You pull that trigger,
and you'll tell the cops exactly where we are,
quicker than Duclair ever could.
Trust me, they're out there, listening.
They're waiting for us to give up our location.
That gun leads them right to us.
Let's go.
Before I change my mind.
Wait, hold on.
How far is that stream?
It's not far-- half a mile. Why?
We're heading to higher ground.
We need to fill these bottles.
We're not gonna get very far without water.
Okay.
But only Burns goes.
No offense, but, uh, i don't know you.
So I trust you even less than these guys.
If the Yakuza put a hit out on Adam,
it had to be because he was working with Gabriel.
Or because Shioma thought he was.
Well, they'd have to have
solid intel to come at him this strong.
You know? And it'd be another reason why Adam's running.
Did you hear what I said?
Yeah, I heard what you said.
I'm not saying you're wrong. Did I say you're wrong?
No, you didn't, but then what would be the opposite of that?
The word opposite of...
Why can't you just say I'm right?
Say, "You're right about something."
Why can't you say that?
Why?
Am I, am I speaking to myself?
Why can't you say that?
Because you're wrong.
Adam's not running.
He's leaving a trail for us to find him.
Are you crazy?
I thought you were the cops.
Sorry. They sent me to find you.
Stockman's anxious to get moving.
He needs to relax. I'm not done here.
All right, let me help.
All right, thanks.
What's taking them so long?
Asking that every minute
ain't gonna get them here any faster.
Oh, I'd shut up if I were you.
You got a problem with me?
Yeah, I do.
How's a guy with two bodies on him
get only 18 months in protective custody, hmm?
Answer him.
The government had a weak case; I took a plea.
Or maybe you used some of that Noshimuri money
to get yourself a comfy little sentence, huh?
Yeah, you got that wrong, friend.
Yakuza slit my brother's throat three years ago
over a gambling debt.
Let's get one thing straight.
I ain't your friend.
No.
I'm sorry about your brother.
Where the hell have you been?!
Looking for Burns.
He wasn't at the stream.
We've wasted enough time. We got to go.
Yeah, we have to assume the cops got to him.
All right!
Let's move.
Who is she?
Michelle Shioma, Goro's oldest daughter.
Married mother of two,
masters in business admin,
soccer mom, president of the PTA.
Model citizen, until you get to these bank transactions.
The money used to pay off Tuasopo came from her?
Uh-huh. His account's under her direct control.
I checked with the head of security at the branch
where the wire transfers originated.
Michelle was physically present and signed for them.
And there's security footage to prove it.
She's out to avenge her father's death.
So why put Adam in the crosshairs?
I'm thinking she found out
about Gabriel's meeting with Adam,
and figured that the two of them were in business.
So that makes him an enemy of the family.
Michelle Shioma.
Lieutenant Kelly, Five-0.
I need you to step out of the vehicle, please.
Lieutenant, as you can see,
I'm driving my children home from school.
If you need anything from me,
I suggest you call my attorney.
Why don't you hold onto that and call him yourself.
Your girls are gonna need a ride home.
Step out of the vehicle, please.
You're not nearly as sharp as your father, Michelle.
See, your father knew how to cover his tracks.
He never would've been careless enough to leave
the paper trail that you did,
leading straight to Tuasopo's bank account.
And your father would've known that Tuasopo
was also on Gabriel's payroll.
Did you know he was the same guard who slipped
Gabriel into Halawa to meet with Adam Noshimuri?
You didn't know that, did you?
Tuasopo played you, Michelle.
He saw the chance to make a few extra bucks,
so he told you about Gabriel's partnership offer to Adam.
But what he didn't tell you was that Adam said no.
So all of this was for nothing.
But you didn't know that.
You just knew that Gabriel was in hiding
and that Adam was in protective custody,
so you needed to make your play.
And that's where things got messy.
Well, literally, because you did set up the chemical spill.
And you were the one to pay Tuasopo to put Adam on that bus.
But the IED didn't quite do its job, did it?
And the hit man?
he tagged the wrong guy.
That's a very amusing story, Lieutenant.
The only part of it that made any sense to me
is the part about the kind woman
depositing money into a dear friend's account to help pay
for a decent education for his children.
If that's a crime,
then... I'm guilty.
Is that really the story you're sticking with?
Lieutenant,
you seem to know my father very well.
But not the fact that for the last five years of his life,
he wasn't very active in the business.
You see, he left the day-to-day
to the person he trusted most.
The one person he knew would do...
whatever was necessary to protect our family's interests,
no matter how heavily it weighs on their conscience.
Is that a threat?
All right, judging by this fire,
they were here in the last two hours.
If they're no longer shackled,
they're gonna be moving a hell of a lot quicker.
We got to pick up the pace.
Aquino's dead.
Yeah, we found his body about a mile back.
We followed the blood trail; led us right back here to you.
Garavito smashed his head in with a rock.
And that ain't all.
He chewed off Aquino's hand at the wrist to get free.
Okay.
He's not the only one off his chains.
Well, so much for the advantage.
No, we still got one.
What are those?
Adam's been leaving us a trail.
What I tell you?
Now, let's go find them.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on. Stop.
I get that this Garavito is a psychopath,
nut job, maniac or whatever, but I don't get it.
He kills the guy that he's chained to.
And instead of disappearing,
he doubles back and rejoins the group-- why?
Strength in numbers.
No.
He's not done killing.
Chin, hey. How'd you do with the Shioma woman?
Oh, you'd love her.
She's beautiful, sophisticated...
and she'd shoot you in the face
just to make sure the gun worked.
While Chin was getting the silent treatment,
I ran her cell records.
There were dozens of incoming calls to her phone
before and after the attack on the bus.
These calls were pinging cell towers
in the area of your crime scene.
And we triangulated on those GPS signals.
There are at least four active signals
within a mile of your current location.
Steve, we believe those are
troops on the ground looking for Adam.
We've got company. We gonna move.
Come on, hurry up! You're holding us up!
Hey! Are you crazy?!
What are you doing?
What'd you do that for?
He murdered Burns and probably Aquino, too.
What are you talking about?
There was fresh blood on his pants,
and he stopped bleeding hours ago.
And where do you think he got this?
You gave it to Burns.
Think about it.
Why would Burns run off?
He had no reason.
Garavito killed him,
and he came back to kill the rest of us.
Where the hell are you going?!
Move, you die.
Easy, easy.
I'm not running.
I'm not running.
My name is Adam Noshimuri.
We know who you are.
On your knees, hands over your head.
I'm unarmed.
I surrender.
Shut up!
You guys aren't real cops, are you?
Whoever's paying you to do this, I'll double it.
With what, Mr. Noshimuri?
Everyone knows you have nothing left.
You think I gave everything to Shioma, you're wrong.
I think you'd say anything right now to stay alive.
Now we're even.
Call Max,
tell him we got another body.
What was that?
Nothing.
What's going on?
It's fine. Everything's fine.
Don't lie to me.
Whatever happened, just tell me.
They found Burns's body by a creek
a couple miles back.
Was it Garavito?
He opened the guy's chest up
with a broken bottle and ate his heart.
He's not gonna stop until he kills every one of them.
I'm not a real cop.
Doesn't matter.
People who I work for will never...
Hey, Garavito!
Drop the knife!
Put down the knife!
Yeah, I need an immediate medical evacuation.
Sending location now.
Thank you.
Shut up.
How many more are with you?
Burns said you turned yourself in last time you escaped.
That's right.
So why'd you run this time?
Thought the best place for me was on the inside.
I was wrong.
It took you guys long enough.
You all right?
Yeah.
This is Captain Grover.
I need a medevac for a gunshot wound
on a male escaped convict, Jason Duclair.
Copy that. Medevac on the way.
Looks like my ride's here.
Come here.
No more secrets.
No more secrets.
We're gonna make it.
I know.
No matter what happens,
we'll always find our way back to each other.
What's up?
Hey, uh, sorry about the whole, uh, tire thing.
Uh, I dropped off the jack in your garage.
Don't worry about it.
Anyways, the food fest was amazing.
I made so much tips, and, uh, Kamekona, he, uh...
he won best original dish for, uh, that, uh,
that, uh, three-alarm chili shrimp dog.
Yeah, that was so good.
So, uh, what... what'd you want to talk to me about?
Sit down for a sec.
Uh, I don't know why I'm crying.
He wasn't really a good person.
Yeah, he was still your father.
I got no more family left.
Yeah, you do, pal.
