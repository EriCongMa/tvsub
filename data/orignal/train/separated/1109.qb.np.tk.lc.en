guys .
gotcha !
that &apos;s so not funny , alison !
i thought it was hilarious , girls .
ali , did you download the new beyonce ?

i &apos;m loving her new video .

em .
whoa .
where &apos;s ali and spencer ?
we don &apos;t know .
ali ?
she &apos;s gone .
what do you mean she &apos;s gone ?
i &apos;ve looked everywhere for her .
i think i heard her scream .
aria , are you okay ?
it &apos;s weird to be home .
we were gone a year .
when you &apos;re 16 , that &apos;s a long time .
i still think about her everyday .
why don &apos;t you call your friends ?
they don &apos;t know we &apos;re back from dad &apos;s sabbatical .
on the news , they &apos;re calling it
the anniversary of alison &apos;s disappearance ,
like it &apos;s a party or something .
why don &apos;t you give them a call ?
you five were inseparable ,
and those feelings don &apos;t just go away .
i need a ride to lacrosse !
i &apos;ll take him .
got lacrosse today ?
it &apos;s first tryouts ,
and all my stuff &apos;s in about a hundred boxes .
a hundred ?
you know what i mean .
come on , let &apos;s go look in the garage .

listen , i know coming back here
brings up a lot of memories .
you okay ?
dad , i &apos;m still keeping your secret , okay ?
i mean , are you okay with alison ?
and they &apos;re running off to practice .
we are officially home .
hey , what time am i picking you up ?
uh , six .
okay , i &apos;m gonna grab some food .
can i get a cheeseburger , please ?
you got it .
you all right down there ?
i &apos;m a bit jetlagged . i just got back from europe .
where in europe ?
iceland .
i spent some time in reykjavik
before i went to amsterdam .
it &apos;s a great city .
so , do you go to hollis ?
just graduated .
i &apos;m gonna start my first teaching job .
yeah , i think i &apos;d like to teach .
god , i love this song .
b26 .
what &apos;s your major ?
uh , well , i &apos;m leaning toward english .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m teaching .
well , and i write too , but ...
so far , it &apos;s mostly personal .
just for me .
i &apos;m impressed .
why ?
well , i tried writing .
i didn &apos;t get very far .
you &apos;re lucky .
if you &apos;re writing for yourself ,
it &apos;s pure passion .
maybe you &apos;d let me read something of yours .
yeah ? you &apos;d really want to ?
yeah .
you &apos;re smart , you &apos;ve traveled ,
great taste in music .
like to know more about you .
yeah .
i &apos;d like to know more about you too .
could i see the pradas in the front ?
i &apos;ll have to put some in the back .
but they &apos;re all maybes .
hey , is this me ?
or is it a little too much your mother ?
i am loving those glasses . how much ?
350 .
i &apos;ll be right back .
i cannot believe spencer hastings
actually has time to shop .
i mean , you &apos;re interning for the mayor ,
taking classes at hollis , and redoing the barn .
and in your leisure moments , you facebook and tweet .
you know me . i like to stay busy .
it &apos;s called a summer vacay , spence .
you spent yours sunning and shopping .
tweet @-@ tweet .
did you see the paper today ?
yeah .
she &apos;s gone , but she &apos;s everywhere .
i can &apos;t believe it &apos;s been a year .
do you remember what ali said that night ,
about our secrets keeping us close ?
i think it was the opposite .
so ! what &apos;s the occasion ?
family dinner .
we &apos;re meeting melissa &apos;s fiance ?
did miss perfect find a mr. perfect ?
he &apos;s a med student , so everyone &apos;s thrilled .
then that &apos;s not the right top .
you need to turn heads .
away from melissa ? please .
she doesn &apos;t always have to win .
see you around the playground .
see you .
hey , miss !
you forgot your bag .
thank you .
i so thought you were busted .
nice scarf .
nice glasses .
later . see ya .
good luck .
hey .
look , it &apos;s the first day . i don &apos;t want to be late .
i love you , aria . you know that , right ?
yeah . i know .
and you know that i love your mom .
do you ?
i made a mistake , okay ?
and i will be sorry about it for the rest of my life .
i just hope that someday you &apos;ll be able to forgive me .
i hope so too .
aria !
hey , guys !
alison !
hey ! you hear mona ?
hey , aria ! maybe we should wait .
hey , guys !
my god .
is she ever gonna get a clue ? what a loser .
come here .
hey , isn &apos;t that your dad &apos;s car ?
aria ?
emily .
when did you get back ?
hey .
yesterday .
i almost didn &apos;t recognize you .
i think the last time we saw each other ,
you had a pink stripe in your hair .
well , when your parents want you to be yourself
and you don &apos;t know who you are ...
you wore it well .
you should have called about this .
it &apos;s so weird just running into you here .
well , we &apos;ve kind of lost touch , emily , remember ?
that &apos;s what we had to do .
i saw a poster of alison yesterday .
it &apos;s awful .
i mean , we all know she &apos;s dead , right ?
i just never heard anyone say it .
so , i hear the new teacher &apos;s really hot .
is that hanna ?
she &apos;s the &quot; it &quot; girl now .
and where there &apos;s hanna , there &apos;s mona .
that &apos;s mona ?
can you believe it ?
wow . talk about a makeover .
what &apos;s up with her ?
you two fighting ?
we didn &apos;t just fall out of touch with you , aria .
we all fell out of touch with each other .
they &apos;re not so close anymore either .
so they &apos;re friendly , but not friends .
holy crap .
sorry .
uh , i &apos;m mr . fitz , your new english teacher .
alison ?
i can &apos;t believe they sold the house .
just too many memories for the dilaurentises .
i can &apos;t even imagine .
it &apos;s just so weird to think
of other people living in alison &apos;s house .
i know , honey .
aria &apos;s back .
does she still have that pink hair ?
no , mom , she doesn &apos;t .
you know something ? i never really understood that family .
why would a mother let her daughter do something like that ?
because they believe their kids are their equals ,
not their property .
honey , i don &apos;t think you &apos;re my property ,
but i &apos;m your mom .
what kind of mother would i be if i let you
run around looking like a goth ?
that kind of lifestyle might fly in europe ,
but it &apos;s not gonna get you very far here in rosewood .
not everyone dreams of making it in rosewood , mom .
oh ?
some people dream of making it out .
you want that ?
maya st . germain , a.k.a. new girl .
i &apos;m emily .
welcome to the neighborhood .
thank you .
mmm . foie gras and cornichons .
my favorites .
it &apos;s from my mother .
i figured .
oh , that stuff was in my room .
you can have anything you want .
it all belonged to alison .
is she a friend of yours ?
she was , a long time ago .
that &apos;s all i get ? no details ?
uh , there were five of us who used to hang out , but ...
we don &apos;t anymore .
would it be outrageous of me to ask
if you &apos;ll help with our last few boxes ?
yes .
but i don &apos;t mind .
so , why aren &apos;t you still friends
with the girl who used to live here ?
you ask a lot of questions .
how else am i supposed to get to know you ?
there you go . another question .
fine . your turn .
ask me anything .
is this your boyfriend ?
his name is justin .
he &apos;s cute .
he &apos;s also 3,000 miles away .
my boyfriend &apos;s name is ben .
what &apos;s he like ?
he &apos;s a swimmer , like me .
i bet you &apos;re good .
you totally have the body .
my mom &apos;s a cellist .
they &apos;re building a studio .
do you play ?
yeah .
but not the cello .
if you &apos;re a big jock ,
does that mean you &apos;d kill me if i smoked a little weed ?
now ?
i won &apos;t if you don &apos;t want me to .
where are your parents ?
relax .
they &apos;re out .
go ahead .
you want to join me ?
okay .
first time ?
no .
yes .
so i &apos;m corrupting you .
you okay with that ?
yeah . i think i am .
hey , what do you think ?
you have an eye for design . i absolutely love it .
thank you .
honestly , when mom said you were converting the barn to a loft ,
i couldn &apos;t see it , but it &apos;s beautiful .
job well done .
i &apos;m glad you like it .
and i totally appreciate your letting us move in .
what ?
ren and i are staying in the barn
while we redo my place in the city .
i &apos;m moving in for junior year , melissa .
that &apos;s the deal that i made with mom and dad .
i got the grades , i did the internship ,
i gave up my summer because i wanted this .
well , you &apos;ll just have to wait .
why can &apos;t you stay in my room ?
we &apos;re a couple , spencer .
we need our own space , and mom and dad agree .
but they promised me .
is everything okay ?
i &apos;m ren .
i was hoping you &apos;d be happy for me .
well , you know what they say about hope .
breeds eternal misery .
sounds like she was counting on moving into the barn .
don &apos;t worry about spencer . she &apos;ll get over it .
shouldn &apos;t you know better ?
i mean , you are a med student , right ?
you &apos;re a bit of a smart @-@ ass .
a bit ?
does my sister know you smoke ?
does she have to know everything ?
i &apos;m sorry that we &apos;re moving into your loft .
if you want me to say something .
it wouldn &apos;t make a difference .
thank you for being sorry .
you &apos;re not like melissa &apos;s usual boyfriends .
how am i unusual ?
we &apos;re late for dinner .
i actually like you .
that &apos;s what &apos;s unusual .
you told me you went to hollis .
no . i said i was thinking about majoring in english .
and that &apos;s true .
look , i think you &apos;re amazing , aria .
when i first met you , i thought ...
&quot; who is this girl ? &quot;
i &apos;m still that girl . nothing &apos;s changed .
yes . yes , it has . i &apos;m your teacher .
i know it &apos;s not just me .
you ... you feel like this is right for us too .
it &apos;s not right .
we just can &apos;t .
thanks for walking me home .
it &apos;s no big deal .
practice doesn &apos;t start until four .
i &apos;ve never had a jock friend before .
i guess that makes you my first .
are you okay ?
it &apos;s hard for me to talk about .
i didn &apos;t tell you everything
about the girl who used to live here .
alison .
she disappeared last summer .
she &apos;s still missing .
that must have been awful for you .
i used to think if i didn &apos;t talk about her ,
i wouldn &apos;t think about her .
but you still do .
yeah .
i &apos;m sorry .
see you tomorrow ?
yeah . bye .
hey , you been hanging out with aria ?
not really .
你找到了另一个可以亲吻的朋友 alison &#93;
emily .
is everything all right ?
why wouldn &apos;t it be ?
perfect time for a jacuzzi .
i thought you guys weren &apos;t moving in till next week .
melissa wanted to get settled before classes start .
you wouldn &apos;t happen to have a towel , would you ?
tough day at school ?
tough field hockey practice .
i rowed for oxford .
that looks good on a med school app .
i did it &apos; cause i loved it .
you probably have a fluid buildup in your bursa sac .
i bet you say that to all the girls .
i can help .
okay ...
dr. ren .
that &apos;s awesome .
is that all right ?
ren ?
who were you talking to ?
no one .
found them .
look what else i found .
ohh . she used to drag that thing everywhere .
i think you &apos;re happy to be back .
aren &apos;t you ?
well , haven &apos;t decided yet .
ohh . you and aria are so much alike .
i don &apos;t think she &apos;s happy to be home either .
i know it was like a vacation from our real life , but ...
i felt like we really bonded when we were away .
well , we had to connect . we didn &apos;t know anybody else .
i don &apos;t want to lose that .
are you really worried that we will ?
it &apos;s just easy for stuff to get in the way .
what do you mean ? what kind of stuff ?
you know , i &apos;m really surprised that she brought that with us .
well , she loves it because you gave it to her .
what kind of stuff could get in the way of us ?
no , nothing , nothing . you know me .
i just get a little overly obsessed about work , that &apos;s all .
we &apos;re good , ella .
come here .
mm . it &apos;s all good .
oh , i drove past alison &apos;s house today .
it &apos;s definitely something i haven &apos;t missed .
oh , god . a year later .
imagine what that poor family is going through .
i can &apos;t . i don &apos;t ever want to imagine .
if anything ever happened to you ...
nothing is gonna happen .
we are safe . we &apos;re together .
and we &apos;re home .
但记住了 如果你吻他 我会告密的 a &#93;
are you gonna eat that , sweetie ?
i &apos;m being a friend , hanna .
aren &apos;t you supposed to be at alison &apos;s ?
hi , girls !
hi , ian .
you still need help with your scoop , spence ?
i &apos;ve got my stick in the car .
ian , what are you , her babysitter ?
you need to tell your sister .
tell me what ?
nothing .
come on .
outside .
what the hell are you doing ?
she &apos;s gonna find out .
no , she &apos;s not .
i promise you , she is ,
because if you don &apos;t tell her , i will .
i thought you were my friend .
don &apos;t you get it ?
i &apos;m trying to help you do the right thing .
it was one kiss .
now , you listen to me , alison .
or what ?
if you say one word to my sister about ian ,
i will tell everyone the truth about the jenna thing .
alison ?
i &apos;m sorry for just stopping by .
no . any time , em . come on , you know that .
somebody left a note in my locker .
from &quot; a &quot; ?
you too ?
do you really think it &apos;s her ? is it possible ?
only alison could have known .
what ? known ... known what ?
it was ...
personal ?
i really believed she was dead .
yeah . yeah , we all did .
could she really be back ?
i think she &apos;s playing with us .
why would she do that ?
it &apos;s alison that we &apos;re talking about here .
i mean , wasn &apos;t that her favorite sport ?
should we tell someone ?
i don &apos;t ...
i don &apos;t know about you , but ...
i can &apos;t .
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re back .
it &apos;s funny ...
i mean , even though i grew up here ,
i feel like a total outsider .
me too .
i ran into ella montgomery today .
why didn &apos;t you tell me aria was back ?
it &apos;s not like we &apos;re still friends .
she didn &apos;t know your father left .
i hate telling that story .
so change the story . i did .
you grew up . you grew apart .
it was mutual , and , honestly ,
we are much happier without him .
hanna .
say it enough , and you &apos;ll actually start to believe it .
well , i have to admit , it does sound a lot better than the truth .
nobody needs to know that we got dumped .
&quot; we &quot; didn &apos;t get dumped . i did .
he left both of us .
if that &apos;s mona , i &apos;m staging an intervention .
hanna . it &apos;s dinnertime .
it &apos;s ashley .
yes , i left it on your desk .
hanna marin ?
yeah . why ?
is your mother home ?
let me call you back .
what &apos;s this about ?
we received a call from rosewood mall security .
they have your daughter on tape
shoplifting a pair of sunglasses .
i &apos;m sure there &apos;s been a mistake .
i don &apos;t think so . could you turn around ?
mom .
what &apos;s going on ?
let &apos;s go .
really ?
in a small town like this ,
what people think about you matters .
i know .
then why would you risk it all to steal a pair of sunglasses ?
hanna ,
i buy you everything you need to be popular .
that &apos;s not why i do it .
then why do ... ? this is something you do ?
a few times .
this is about your father , isn &apos;t it ?
you think this is going to get his attention .
i made a mistake .
in rosewood , you don &apos;t have room to make a mistake .
and neither do i.
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;ll fix it somehow .
you will deny you did anything wrong .
it was a misunderstanding .
but ...
i &apos;m taking care of it .
maya !
emily !
i thought something might have happened to you .
i tried to call you .
what &apos;s going on ?
they found your friend .
i knew she was back . is she inside ? emily !
i &apos;m sorry .
they found alison &apos;s body .
i hear the cops take hanna to the police station today .
you don &apos;t think she &apos;d ever talk about ...
the jenna thing ?
we made promise .
current owners of the residence were in the process of
demolishing the structure to make room for a renovation project
when workers made the gruesome discovery .
the parents of the deceased were unavailable for comment ,
but a family spokesperson has confirmed
the gazebo was under construction
the summer 15 @-@ year @-@ old alison dilaurentis disappeared .
tonight , the family is asking for privacy
as they come to terms
with the sad ending to a year @-@ long mystery ,
and local authorities are coming to terms
with the fact a killer is at large in rosewood .
thank you so much .
the discovery of her body rocked this community ,
and today , hundreds of mourners gather
to say goodbye to alison dilaurentis .
was she a friend of yours ?
do you care ?
i don &apos;t know what i feel worse about ...
having to stay away from you
or being a jerk about it .
yeah , she was one of my best friends .
i &apos;m sorry .
for alison , or for being a jerk ?
both .
thank you .
i would never want to do anything that would get you in trouble .
goodbye , ezra .
mrs. dilaurentis .
aria !
i &apos;m so glad you came .
i asked the other girls to sit together up front .
it &apos;s what alison would have wanted .
of course .
poor ali .
can you believe what a scene this is ?
alison would have loved it .
popular in life and death .
no , thanks . i don &apos;t ...
today , i think you do .
anyone we know ?
no , it &apos;s just my mom sending me a text .
emily and i aren &apos;t the only ones who got messages from &quot; a , &quot; are we ?
oh , my god .
it &apos;s jenna .
did you see that jenna marshall was here ?
i didn &apos;t realize she and ali were friends .
they weren &apos;t .
the lord give them and
the lord take them away .
emily . spencer .
aria and hanna .
do we know you ?
i &apos;m detective wilden .
i understand you were all good friends with the victim .
yeah , we were .
i &apos;m gonna need to talk to each one of you .
we talked to the police when alison went missing .
and i intend to go over every one of your statements .
this is no longer a missing persons investigation .
it &apos;s a murder .
rest assured ,
i will find out what happened that summer .
do you think he knows about ... ?
no . how could he ?
oh , my god .
it &apos;s from ...
i got one too .
&quot; i &apos;m still here , bitches ... and i know everything .
a &apos; . &quot;
