Hut, hut!
Try and catch me!
C'mon!
Huddle, huddle, huddle!
Let's go! Let's go!
Hut, hut!
I just want to thank my hands for being so awesome.
Nice catch, Captain.
Thank you.
Why is he here?
I mean, uh, his family's all in Chicago.
He had no place to go.
So you invited him to a family football game?
Yeah.
Oh. Look, I understand you guys had a bonding moment,
but you're aware that that's the guy
that ratted you out to the governor?
I'm just reminding you.
I mean, it's Thanksgiving, okay?
I mean, call me the bigger man.
They're waiting for you.
Come on, let's huddle!
Come on, guys. Let's bring it in. Huddle, huddle!
42-35, our favor.
Listen, we hold 'em here, the game's ours. All right?
All right, now we got 'em. This is the play.
Danny, I want you to line up on my right, run a post,
you two line up on either side of me. I want you to cross...
Just-Just give me the ball. I'll get it into the end zone.
The only way you're getting the ball
is if you got a jet pack up your culo, okay?
On three-- defense! One, two, three.
Defense!
All right!
Let's go!
Here we go, take it down.
Let's go. Come on. Easy six!
Man, I got you.
Here we go. Here we go. Ready?
Give me the ball.
Set... hut!
Here we go!
No! Not Williams. No...
All-State QB. We're all tied up. Next touchdown wins.
Hold up, hold up, hold up.
上午9:45 放火鸡进烤箱
That's it I gotta go.
Whoa, whoa, go where?
Go where? What are you talking about?
I gotta, I gotta put the turkey in the oven.
Oh-oh! What are you doing? What are you doing?
You want to eat today or what?
Oh! Have Mary put the thing in the thing.
What are you doing?
Mary's the prep cook.
What are you all looking at me for?
The prep cook doesn't get to stuff the turkey, okay?
This is my operation.
Oh, come on, are you serious?
This is unbelievable. We got a game here.
I'll be back in ten minutes!
What the hell?
It didn't thaw.
What?!
I know, I know.
Did you take it out of the freezer last night?
Yeah.
And you put it in cold water?
Yeah. For sure.
Did you put it in cold water?
No.
No, I-I completely forgot.
Please don't be mad. Please.
You know what? I knew something like this
would happen if I made you my prep cook.
Well, then why'd you make me your prep cook
if you knew this was gonna happen?
You forced me to make you my prep cook.
You told me that mashing potatoes wasn't enough responsibility.
You wanted more responsibility.
And I made you my prep cook.
You're right.
Okay, but listen. I'm sorry.
Joan was so fussy last night.
I couldn't-I couldn't get her down.
And I apologize.
Yes, I'm coming!
Okay, uh, do me a favor.
Put the oven on, get the sides started.
And I'll-I'll figure something out.
Happy Thanksgiving!
Aunt Deb?
Come here and give me a hug.
What are you doing here?
Well, it's been years since I've seen you,
and I figured it's high time i paid you a visit.
You look fantastic.
Well, look at you. Let me see...
What?
What do you got?
I see a little little gray fleck right there.
Oh, yeah,
a little bit. You like that?
Yeah, yeah, I like it.
I think it makes you look very distinguished.
Thank you very much.
Yeah.
The tattoos not so much.
Aunt Deb?
Oh! It's Mary and her little lamb.
Oh, honey! Oh!
I didn't know you were coming.
Did you know she was coming?
No, I had no idea.
Oh, it's so great to see you guys.
Well, come on. Let's sit down.
Aunt Deb, we'd love to, but we're in
the middle of a culinary crisis right now.
We, um, screwed up the turkey.
It's still frozen.
"We."
Well, then I got here just in time.
McGarrett. Yeah, okay, I'm on the way.
I gotta go.
What, you're leaving already?
It's work. I gotta go.
Listen, can you handle the bird, please?
Are you kidding? We got it covered. Go. Go.
I want constant updates, though.
All right?
All right, okay, go, go.
So, what are the odds of me actually eating turkey today?
What do I got, a 10% chance? 20%?
Will you relax, okay? My Aunt Deb is there.
She's gonna figure everything out.
Oh, your Aunt Deb. Your father's sister.
The one who took care of Mary after your mother faked her death?
There's something seriously wrong with you, you know that?
Me?
You like reminding me of that?
Why would you like reminding me of that?
It's the truth.
Yes, it's the truth.
Yes, it's the truth.
Aunt Deb who raised Mary all by herself.
That must have been trying.
You don't know the half of it.
She walked away from a record deal
when that kid got thrown in her lap, you know that?
She was a singer?
You didn't know that?
I did not.
Yeah, she struggled as a backup singer for 20 years,
and she finally got a big break,
but she walked away from it
as soon as Mary came into the picture.
Just like that, huh? Just like that, man.
She knew she couldn't raise a kid
if she was gonna be on the road half the year,
so she quit.
She became a singing coach instead.
Oh, ah, Catherine.
Yeah?
What's up?
All right, here's what we know:
so, a four-man crew was out trolling for some skipjack
when they hooked this.
Huh. 45-gallon barrel. That's not your usual bycatch.
Let me guess. There's a-a body in here.
Just take a look.
All right.
Oh, no.
Where's the rest of him?
Help you ladies?
Yeah, we need a turkey.
You know it's Thanksgiving, right?
Yeah. Look, hairnet, we don't need sarcasm,
all we need is a turkey, okay?
Please? We're desperate.
Let me check.
Here, honey, come here. No-no-no-no-no-no.
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
Are you sure?
Oh, yeah. Come on.
My baby.
You're like a baby whisperer.
I got my moves.
Oh, yeah? Can I have some?
What is it?
I don't know. I just, I really feel like I'm in over my head.
Did you ever feel like that with me?
Always.
Really?
So I'm guessing I didn't make life very easy for you.
Well, let me put it this way.
You had your moments.
How'd you do it, Deb?
I mean, I feel like i have no clue what I'm doing.
You think I did?
Oh, honey, I-I was winging it the whole time.
And it-it was scary.
Being a mom is the hardest job in whole wide world.
But, you know, I can't think of anybody
who's better suited for it than you.
You got a big heart.
You're smart.
All you have to do is love her with everything you got
and you're gonna be fine.
Hey, sweetie.
Okay, here we are.
Oh, you're kidding.
That's the best you got? The runt of the litter?
Hey, next time plan ahead.
Thank you for that sage advice.
What are you saying, cuz?
I'm saying it's over.
After we got back from Tokyo,
we took down the rest of Michael Noshimuri's allies.
That faction's gone, Kono.
They're finished.
Any closer to finding Adam?
Um, from what I've been able to piece together,
I think he may be in Seattle.
So I'm flying there today.
Okay. It's gonna be easier for you to move around
now that you don't have to look over your shoulder.
So I guess that means
you'll be spending Thanksgiving at 30,000 feet.
Table's gonna feel empty without you.
I'll be there next year.
I promise.
Hey, look, I should get going.
I don't want to miss my flight.
Good luck.
Mahalo, cuz... for everything.
I just got off the phone with Kono.
She's heading to Seattle.
New lead?
We'll see.
So where are we at?
Okay, according to Fong,
the barrel our vic was found in was filled with lye.
Surprise, it's highly corrosive.
It's also cheap and easy to get.
Max finish the autopsy?
He did.
And look what he found around the vic's neck.
What is that, a medical alert ID?
Says the name is Kyle Russo, D.O.B.: 5-9-78.
Kyle Russo
Our vic was Secret Service.
大威基基希尔顿度假酒店
Excuse me, Devon Campbell.
Steve McGarrett.
Catherine Rollins. Five-O.
Field office said you guys were coming. Hang on a sec. Sorry.
Busy day.
Yeah, we can see that. What's going on?
The president's on his way to the Island.
He'll be here later today.
He usually does Thanksgiving in DC,
but two nights ago he decided he wanted to come here.
Doesn't leave us much prep time, but... we'll be ready.
What can I do for you?
We need to talk to you about one of your agents, Kyle Russo.
Yeah, what about him?
He was murdered yesterday.
What?
We found his remains in a barrel
just offshore this morning.
You got any suspects?
No, sir, we don't.
But everything is pointing to a professional hit.
When was the last time you spoke with Agent Russo?
I got a text from him last night.
He said he was headed up to the North Shore this morning
to check on a bookstore POTUS might want to visit.
What time did he send that text?
A little after 9:00. Why?
Because our M.E. puts time of death someplace
5:00 and 7:00.
That means Agent Russo's killer
took his phone, sent you that text so you wouldn't
be suspicious when he didn't show up
for work this morning.
Right.
My God.
Agent Campbell. What?
All our agents have intel on POTUS's trip
stored on their phone.
Itinerary down to the half-minute,
path of the motorcade,
emergency protocols.
If that intel has fallen into the wrong hands,
then we have a threat to the president.
距到达还有六小时
As a precaution, we're changing the path of the motorcade
ascape routes.
HPD's helping us lock everything down
and SWAT's gonna back up our Counter Assault Team.
Thank you for coming, Captain.
No problem. I got everybody on this.
希尔顿夏威夷度假村
All right.
What do you want from my team?
Plain and simple.
I need you to find the son of a bitch that killed Kyle Russo.
Now, I don't have assets in place to run an investigation.
Right now, my only concern has to be
the president's safety and security.
I have no other priorities.
All right, I need to, uh, retrace Russo's steps.
What can you tell me about his activities yesterday?
He was in Kailua for most of it.
POTUS stays at
a private home out there when he's in town.
Russo was looking into some of the residents
to see if any of 'em posed a threat.
He check in with you?
He said there was one guy
he wanted to run some background on,
maybe... maybe talk to again.
He give you a name?
Keith Nolan. That's all he gave me.
Apparently, this guy's renting a house out there
less than a quarter of a mile from the one pOTUS is staying in.
Russo said it was probably nothing.
When I got that text last night,
I just assumed the guy checked out.
Yeah, maybe he did.
But if Russo considered him a potential threat,
he's somebody we want to talk to.
All right.
凯斯·诺兰租住处
Mr. Nolan?
Steve McGarrett, Five-O.
Can we talk to you?
Boiling water on the stove.
The guy, uh, took off in a hurry.
That is a big bullet.
This is a NATO 7.62 sniper round.
It's accurate up to 1,000 meters.
So maybe Russo was onto something.
Hey! Five-O!
Let me see your hands, right now. Who are you?
I'm Sheila Hicks.
I live up the street.
I look after the house for the owner.
Can I put my hands down now, please?
Of course you can. I'm sorry.
Uh... you, uh,
you happen to get a look at the guy
that's been staying here?
Mr. Nolan?
Yeah, he got in yesterday morning.
He's from Maui.
He's a very friendly guy.
Oh, it's just my daughter!
Come here, sweetie.
Mom, what's going on?
It's okay.
These men are Five-O.
We just have some questions
about the man who's renting this house.
Can you tell us what he looked like?
Sure. He's 40s.
Six feet.
Black hair. Oh, and you know what?
And he had a tattoo on the back of his neck.
How 'bout this guy?
You, uh... you seen him?
Yes.
I saw him and Mr.Nolan talking outside yesterday.
What time was that?
Little after 4:00?
You know, he didn't stay very long.
Maybe three, four minutes.
And then he left,
and Mr. Nolan took off right after that.
But I-I haven't seen either of them since.
Okay, how 'bout you?
You see anything?
I just got in an hour ago.
She flew in for the holiday.
My Andrea's been traveling for the last few months
but she wanted to spend Thanksgiving with her mom.
Oh, that's nice.
That's nice. Uh... here's your keys.
Thank you.
Sorry about the scare,
and thanks for your help.
You need anything, I'm right next door.
Nosy neighbor is a cop's best friend, right?
Right.
All right, thank you.
All right, so Maui PD has no record
of anyone named Keith Nolan
that matches our description.
And according to TSA,
nobody flew in yesterday under that name.
So I am taking a wild guess,
"Keith Nolan" is an alias.
All right, so Russo...
he's out here clearing houses,
he meets a guy who calls himself "Keith Nolan,"
he gets a vibe.
All right, I'm thinking maybe
Nolan could sense that Russo was onto him.
He follows him and he kills him.
It's a good theory.
If we're right, I only have one question:
this guy had to have known the president was coming
before the Secret Service went public with it.
That's closely-guarded info.
How did he get it?
Advance team's been on the ground for 36 hours.
Maybe he figured it out.
Yeah, McGarrett.
Wait a minute, what?
What do you mean, she was...
When was she arrested?
Oh, Mary got arrested.
No, my aunt.
Your aunt got arrested?
I didn't see that coming.
Hi.
Hi.
Thanks.
A second.
You okay?
I'm fine.
Good.
Do you want to tell me what happened?
Well, I...
I needed some grass, and, uh...
how was I supposed to know the guy was a narc?
What?
I wouldn't even be here
if it weren't for those fascists at the dispensary.
They wouldn't take my card.
The dispensary?
What...
Yeah, and the guy behind the counter
told me where I could find some,
and then I run into this narc...
Okay, stop, please. For a minute.
What?
Can we go back?
Yeah.
Why do you have a medical marijuana card?
I have cataracts.
You have cataracts?
Yes.
Cataracts, that's what happens when you get old.
Are you telling me the truth?
Look... half the people my age get them.
Deborah.
Steven... - I'm a cop.
I read people for a living.
You're not telling me everything.
This isn't how I wanted to do this.
Do what?
Okay, um...
A couple of months ago, I wasn't feeling so good,
and, um... I was tired all the time,
nauseous, headaches...
So I went to the doctor
and they ran a whole bunch of tests, and, um...
Turns out...
I have a tumor in my brain.
You have cancer?
Yeah.
How bad is it?
It's bad.
Okay, all right.
What's the plan?
What's the course of treatment?
Well... there is none.
There is none, it's... it's...
it's too far along.
No, but... you know,
chemo, radiation...
No, we talked about that,
but I... I decided against it.
Why?
Because they said it wouldn't work...
so I...
All right, so you just... that's it? You just give up?
Is that what you're gonna do?
No, no, no, no, wait.
Cause you can't do that. No, you can't,
because that's what... You gotta fight this.
Listen to me.
I don't want to spend whatever time I have left
in some hospital,
getting pumped full of poison
and feeling crappy all the time, okay?
That's not how I want to do this.
This is what I've decided.
I know...
Okay.
That's why you're here, isn't it?
You wanted to come say good-bye to us.
Listen, uh... you can't say anything to your sister.
Wait, what?
You can't do that, Deb. That's not fair.
You can't keep this from her.
No, I-I'm gonna tell her,
I'm just waiting for the right moment, okay? Okay.
Look... you better get back to work.
I've still gotta get booked.
You're not getting booked.
I am getting booked.
I don't want any special treatment, okay?
I'm serious.
Fine. Fine.
You're getting booked.
Good.
I'll send someone to pick you up when you're through.
Make sure he's good-looking, okay?
Kid, I love you.
I love you, too.
It's gonna be all right.
So I'm running through some footage that HPD pulled.
I was able to track kyle Russo's movements
from a food truck he ate at
through Duke's Marketplace, and you guys were right.
He was followed. Guy in the baseball cap.
All right, about six feet tall,
uh, black hair, tattoo on his neck.
Matches our description.
All right, keep going.
All right, Chin, roll it back
Let's see if you could snap in,
get a clean frame of his face.
Killer's name is Dante Barkov.
He's an assassin-for-hire.
He has no allegiance to anybody.
What are you doing to find him?
Well, we have an alert out.
We're also looking into any known associates
he may have on the Island.
But right now, we don't have any leads
on his exact whereabouts.
Given the circumstances,
your boss needs to cancel his trip.
That's not gonna happen.
All due respect, sir, we're not talking about
a whack job with a six-shooter, here, okay?
This man represents a serious threat to the president.
Gentlemen...
the president won't cancel.
I mean, think of the message it'd send.
The message?
You get the feeling this gentleman isn't telling us the truth?
Oh, do you get that feeling, too?
This trip is not about Thanksgiving, is it?
If it was, the president
would turn his plane around and go home
because of a man like this.
So why don't you level with us,
and tell us what this smoke screen is all about?
The president is coming for a secret meeting
with a small group from North Korea.
These are one-on-one talks
which could lead to disarmament,
maybe even regime change.
The stakes are huge.
He won't cancel.
Gentlemen, whether we like it or not,
Air Force One is wheels down at 6:00 P.M.
If you're right,
Barkov is still planning to assassinate the president.
We have two hours to find him.
离着陆还有两小时
I just got off the phone with Fong,
who thinks Barkov might have had some help
in disposing of Kyle Russo's body.
It turns out that the M.O. is pretty specific.
For starters,
the lye that was used was actually potassium lye.
It's a lot less common than the regular kind.
Also, it was mixed with water, which speeds up the reaction.
I cross-referenced this particular M.O.
with some old cases and got a few hits.
Anyone with a connection to Barkov?
Just one.
Rafael Moreno.
He's a cleaner for an Albanian crime syndicate.
Barkov allegedly did some jobs for him.
Now, according to Interpol,
Moreno has disappeared at least a dozen bodies
in the last 18 months.
Okay, so Barkov kills Russo
once Russo gets onto him,
but, uh, body disposal isn't exactly in his wheelhouse.
So he calls his boy,
Rafael, who hops a flight to Oahu to help out.
Except for the fact that there's no record
of any Rafael Moreno on any inbound flights.
So he used a fake ID.
Which is exactly why I've got TSA checking to see
if they took any snapshots of him while he was at the airport.
If we can determine what flight he was on,
we can get an alias.
Right, track him down here on the Island,
see if he can lead us to Barkov.
Hey, this is TSA now.
you got a second for me?
For you I got a whole minute.
Thank you. Come here.
Oh, thanks.
Deb?
Yeah.
I'm Catherine Rollins; I'm Steve's friend.
Friend?
Steve asked me to, uh, come pick you up
and take you back to his place.
And did he tell you anything else?
I'm so sorry.
If there's anything you need at all,
just please let me know, okay.
Thank you.
Let's get you home.
No, I don't... I don't want to go back there just yet.
Where would you like to go?
Take me to the most beautiful spot on the Island.
I know just the place.
Come on.
I need some advice.
It's, uh, it's about my aunt.
Aunt Deb, she's sick.
She's sick?
Sick, uh...
She's sick; she's got a brain tumor.
I'm sorry, man.
What, uh, what-what are they gonna do?
It's inoperable,
but she's refusing any other kind of treatment.
I guess that's her choice, right?
Well, yeah, it's her choice, but here's the thing.
I mean, it's not just her who's gonna be affected by this.
I mean, Mary?
Mary-Mary's gonna be destroyed if we lose her.
Okay?
First Mom pulls her famous disappearing act again
and now this?
What do I do?
How do I... How do I get her to change her mind?
I don't think, uh,
I don't think you... I don't think you do try to change her mind.
You know, I mean, look, if this...
is your last Thanksgiving together,
what, you want to spend it arguing?
No.
You want to try to make some memories,
some good memories, something that's gonna last,
something that's gonna bring you through
whatever's coming next.
That's my opinion.
I'm sorry, man.
Hey, so TSA came through.
Moreno flew in late last night
using the name Diego Silva.
Rented a car using the same alias.
I was able to ping it and get a location.
Five-O!
Hey, Five-O.
Hey, hey, don't move. Don't you move.
Rafael Moreno, you're under arrest.
Get down on your knees.
Put your hands behind your head, interlock your fingers.
Really?
You really thought that lame ass move was gonna work?
Brother, you're a lot dumber than you look.
Get up.
Steve, the rest of the house is clear.
There's something you're gonna want to see.
I got him, I got him.
What's the matter?
Somebody shoot you?
'Cause you got a nasty boo-boo.
Looks like Barkov's been staying here as well.
The question is where is he now?
Okay, good.
Yeah, keep me posted.
That was Campbell.
The Secret Service, did they blink?
Air Force One is being diverted to Kona,
and they are pulling the security detail as we speak.
What about the house?
CSU find anything that can tell us where Barkov's headed?
No, not yet.
They're going through the garage right now.
They did find a couple bags of lye, though.
This must be where they brought Russo's body.
Thanks, Captain.
So you gonna tell us where Barkov is?
Rafael, let me, uh, you know, break it down for you,
'cause you seem like you might be confused; I'm here to help you.
Uh, you're an accessory after the fact, which is, uh, it's bad.
Uh, got about a half dozen international law enforcement agencies
that want to talk to you, they want to ask you questions
about some terrible things that they think you've done.
That's just the beginning.
Right, not to mention,
Barkov planned to kill the president, too.
We should add that to the list.
What?
I don't know nothing about the president.
Oh, I'm sure you don't.
Just like you didn't know anything
about Kyle Russo, right?
How about this, Rafael?
You're gonna die in prison.
Okay?
But if you talk to us,
then maybe, maybe we can help you.
I tell you anything about Barkov,
I end up in his crosshairs.
No, no, no.
We'll protect you.
Not from him.
It is beautiful.
You know, the navy took me all around the world,
but this... This is home.
Yeah.
You know, Catherine,
I got a feeling you're gonna be sticking around for a while.
So, um, can I ask you a favor?
Of course.
You know Steve has that tough guy act down pat.
But underneath it all,
he's still that vulnerable little guy
who thought he lost his mom and had to grow up too soon.
And Mary, she's the only one who really gets that about him
because she lived it, too.
Well, once I'm gone,
they're gonna need each other more than ever,
even though they both won't want to admit it.
Stubborn kids.
So...
Maybe you could see to it that they stay close?
I will.
I promise.
Thanks.
Hey, Steve, found a boarding pass.
It's one of Barkov's known aliases.
Check the arrival time.
Barkov landed on Oahu 12 hours before the Secret Service
even started their canvass.
So either this guy is psychic...
Or the president is not the target.
He's after somebody else.
Who's the target, huh?
Who's the real target?
Hey, what's going on? Barkov's not here
for the president-- he's on a job.
That's right. And since Barkov called Moreno here
when he needed help,
I'm thinking that job was for
his old friends back in Albania.
You gonna tell me who the real target is?
Huh? Guys, clear out.
CSU, come on. Let's clear out.
Come on, what, are you gonna waterboard me now?
I don't think so.
What's going on? No, no...
What's going on: you're gonna talk or you're gonna burn.
You understand?
Wait, wait. You can't do this! Hey!
Who's the target? Who's the target?!
Who's the target?! Huh?!
Okay, okay, okay!
Okay. Barkov's target is
a woman in Kailua.
Not enough!
Andrea Hicks! Andrea Hicks!
That's all I know!
Hold on, hold on. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey. The nosy neighbor.
The one who gave us Barkov's description.
Her daughter's name was Andrea.
What did she do to warrant a hit?
I don't know and I didn't ask.
But Barkov won't leave the Island till the job is done.
No answer at Sheila Hicks'.
Catherine, what do you got?
Okay, so I've been looking into Andrea Hicks.
Up until two months ago, she was living in Dallas,
working as a dental hygienist. Then...
she just dropped off the grid.
Do we know why?
Well, according to the FBI,
she witnessed the murder of a high-ranking member
of a Russian crime family.
The Feds wanted to talk to her--
she went into hiding instead.
Okay, and meanwhile the family,
they hire Barkov to track her down
and shut her up,permanently.
All right, Catherine, listen to me.
You keep trying to find Andrea, okay?
We're almost in Kailua.
Yeah, you got it.
We need to get out of here.
What?
Mom, come on...
Came from the woods.
Secure the perimeter.
We need to lock it down. Get your men in position.
All right, you heard the man. Let's move out.
There, there, there.
Oh, my God!
Danny!
Okay, okay.
She's gonna be okay.
She caught it in the shoulder.
What's the matter?
You all right?
Why wouldn't I be all right?
Well, you do seem a little nervous.
Nervous?
Oh, no, no. We're about to meet the President.
Why are you so zen? That's a better question.
All of you.
I'm just cool like that.
You know, the President's a local boy.
That makes us practically Hoapili.
I don't know what that means.
I was nervous, too, the first time.
"The first time"?
When'd you meet the President?
I can't tell you that.
It's classified.
Oh, it's classified, huh? Oh.
Was it during, uh, Operation Strawberry Fields?
I've already said too much.
How do I look? I look all right?
Yeah, you look very handsome.
Thank you.
You do, too.
Thank you.
Here they are, America's heroes. Look at you.
No thanks necessary.
All in a day's work.
I will take one of those longboards though. Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you, brother.
All right, I want to make a toast.
Uh, making the world safer for
turkey and apple pie, that's us.
Speaking of turkey and apple pie, where's dinner?
Well, I'm afraid, uh, Mary and I struck out,
uh, when it came to finding a turkey
big enough to feed everybody here.
But Kamekona here has graciously offered
to fix... A shrimp casserole.
Hey, you guys save the world,
I'll save supper.
No, absolutely not.
We're not eating shrimp for Thanksgiving.
Beggars can't be choosers, brah.
Actually, they can.
Uh, I have a contingency plan.
Really? What kind of plan?
I can't tell you, it's classified.
Again with the classified, huh?
I had the talk with Mary.
How'd she take it?
She's a strong girl,
but I think right now, she needs her brother.
We're gonna get through this.
Yeah?
I just feel so bad for Joan.
She's so young, and she's not gonna remember her aunt.
I know. It's okay though.
We're gonna tell her all about Aunt Deb.
We're gonna tell her all about how much she loved us.
All right?
I'm really sorry about the turkey.
Come on.
That's the best thing that could've happened.
Boy, you're a great audience.
And because you're a great audience,
I got a special surprise for you.
Is he gonna tell that Sinatra story again?
No, I don't think so.
Many, many years ago,
my good friend John McGarrett used to brag about
his sister singing in these legendary nightclubs
in Los Angeles, like the Trocadero,
Ciro's and the Cocoanut Grove.
And the beat goes on and on.
Well, I never got to hear her.
But as fate has it,
right here tonight in this club,
we have... Deb McGarrett.
Deb, would you please come up and sing a song
for this marvelous audience?
You plan this?
Just making some memories, right?
Well, I certainly didn't expect this.
I mean, I haven't sung in, well...
about a hundred years, and, uh...
Well, these old pipes are pretty rusty.
But, uh, since it's a special occasion,
oh, what the hell.
I'd like to dedicate this song to my family,
my little ohana, Steve, Mary and baby Joanie.
I love you all so very much.
Here goes. Bear with me.
Maestro.
*Taking stock of what I have and what I haven't*
*What do I find*
*The things I've got will keep me satisfied*
*Checking up on what I have and what I haven't*
*What do I find*
*A healthy balance on the credit side*
*Got no diamond, got no pearl*
*Still I think I'm a lucky girl*
*I've got the sun in the morning*
*And the moon at night*
*Got no silver, got no gold*
*What I've got can't be bought or sold*
*I've got the sun in the morning*
*And the moon at night*
*Sunshine gives me a lovely day*
*Moonlight gives me the Milky Way*
*Got no diamond, got no pearl*
*Still I think I'm a lucky girl*
*And with the sun in the morning*
*And the moon in the evening*
