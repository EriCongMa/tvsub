i &apos;m sorry . she &apos;s gone .
at least let me say good @-@ bye .
you .
you found me .
did you ever doubt i would ?
truthfully ...
the glass coffin gave me pause .
well , you never have to worry . i will always find you .
do you promise ?
i do .
and do you , snow white ,
promise to take this man to be your husband
and love him for all eternity ?
i do .
i now pronounce you husband and wife .
sorry i &apos;m late .
it &apos;s the queen . run !
she &apos;s not a queen anymore .
she &apos;s nothing more than an evil witch .
no , no , no . don &apos;t stoop to her level . there &apos;s no need .
you &apos;re wasting your time .
you &apos;ve already lost ,
and i will not let you ruin this wedding .
oh , i haven &apos;t come here to ruin anything .
on the contrary , dear .
i &apos;ve come to give you a gift .
we want nothing from you .
but you shall have it .
my gift to you ...
is this happy , happy day ,
for tomorrow my real work begins .
you &apos;ve made your vows .
now i make mine .
soon everything you love ,
everything all of you love
will be taken from you forever ,
and out of your suffering
will rise my victory .
i shall destroy your happiness ,
if it is the last thing i do .
hey !
that a good book ?
this ? it &apos;s more than just a book .
boston south station .
thank you for riding greyhound .
hold on .
uh , you take credit cards ?
where to , chief ?
emma ?
ryan ?
you look relieved .
uh , well , it is the internet .
pictures can be--
fake , outdated ,
stolen from a victoria &apos;s secret catalog .
exactly .
so ...
so ... um , tell me something about yourself , emma .
oh , uh , well ...
today &apos;s my birthday .
and you &apos;re spending it with me ?
what about your friends ?
kind of a loner .
and ... you don &apos;t like your family ?
no family to like .
oh , come on . everyone has a family .
technically , yeah ,
but not everyone knows who they are .
ready to run yet ?
oh , not a chance .
you , emma , are , by far ,
the sexiest friendless orphan that i have ever met .
okay . your turn .
no , wait . let me guessss
um , you are handsome , charming ...
go on .
the kind of guy who--
and now stop me if i get this wrong--
embezzled from your employer , got arrested ,
and skipped town before they were able to throw your ass in jail .
what ?
and the worst part of all of this is your wife .
your wife loves you so much that she bailed you out ,
and how do you repay that loyalty ?
you &apos;re on a date .
who are you ?
the chick who put up the rest of the money .
you &apos;re a bail bondsman .
a bail bondsperson .
really ?
come on .
look , you don &apos;t have to do this , okay ?
i can pay you . i &apos;ve got money .
no , you don &apos;t , and if you did ,
you should give it to your wife to take care of your family .
what the hell do you know about family , huh ?
nothing .
another banner year .
can i help you ?
are you emma swan ?
yeah . who are you ?
my name &apos;s henry . i &apos;m your son .
whoa . hey , kid . kid . kid !
i don &apos;t have a son .
where are your parents ?
ten years ago , did you give up a baby for adoption ?
that was me .
give me a minute .
hey , you have any juice ?
never mind . found some .
you know , we should probably get going .
going where ?
i want you to come home with me .
okay , kid . i &apos;m calling the cops .
then i &apos;ll tell them you kidnapped me .
and they &apos;ll believe you ,
because i &apos;m your birth mother .
yep .
you &apos;re not gonna do that .
try me .
you &apos;re pretty good , but here &apos;s the thing .
there &apos;s not a lot i &apos;m great at in life ,
but i have one skill .
let &apos;s call it a superpower .
i can tell when anyone is lying ,
and you , kid , are .
wait . please don &apos;t call the cops .
please .
come home with me .
where &apos;s home ?
storybrooke , maine .
storybrooke ? seriously ?
all righty then .
let &apos;s get you back to storybrooke .
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing .
you &apos;re thinking about what the queen said again , aren &apos;t you ?
snow , please . i can &apos;t keep having this conversation .
you have to let it go .
we &apos;re about to have a baby .
i haven &apos;t had a restful night since our wedding .
that &apos;s what she wants , to get in your head ,
but they &apos;re only words .
she can &apos;t hurt us .
she poisoned an apple
because she thought i was prettier than her .
you have no idea of what she &apos;s capable .
what can i do to ease your mind ?
let me talk ... to him .
him ?
you don &apos;t mean
i do .
no . no , no . it &apos;s too dangerous .
he sees the future .
there &apos;s a reason he &apos;s locked up .
can you promise me that our child will be safe ?
can you guarantee it ?
because he can .
all right . for our child .
i &apos;m hungry . do you want to stop somewhere ?
this is not a road trip . we &apos;re not stopping for snacks .
why not ?
quit complaining , kid .
remember , i could have put your butt on a bus .
i still could .
you know , i have a name . it &apos;s henry .
what &apos;s that ?
i &apos;m not sure you &apos;re ready .
ready for some fairy tales ?
they &apos;re not fairy tales .
they &apos;re true .
every story in this book actually happened .
of course it did .
use your superpower . see if i &apos;m lying .
just because you believe something doesn &apos;t make it true .
that &apos;s exactly what makes it true .
you should know more than anyone .
why is that ?
because you &apos;re in this book .
oh , kid . you &apos;ve got problems .
yep , and you &apos;re gonna fix &apos; em .
when we reach the cell , stay out of the light ,
and whatever you do , do not let him know your name .
if he knows your name ,
he will have power over you .
rumplestiltskin .
rumplestiltskin !
i have a question for you .
no , you don &apos;t .
they do .
snow white and ... prince charming .
you insult me .
step into the light
and take off those ridiculous robes .
that &apos;s much better .
we &apos;ve come to ask you about the ...
yes , yes ! i know why you &apos;re here .
you want to know about the queen &apos;s threat .
tell us what you know !
ohh . tense , aren &apos;t we ?
fear not , for i can ease your mind ,
but it &apos;s gonna cost you something in return .
no . this is a waste of time .
what do you want ?
the name of your unborn child ?
absolutely not .
deal . what do you know ?
the queen has created a powerful curse ,
and it &apos;s coming .
soon you &apos;ll all be in a prison ,
just like me , only worse ,
for your prison , all of our prisons will be time ,
for time will stop ,
and we will be trapped someplace horrible ,
where everything we hold dear ,
everything we love will be ripped from us ,
while we suffer for all eternity ,
while the queen celebrates ,
victorious at last !
no more happy endings .
what can we do ?
we can &apos;t do anything .
who can ?
that little thing growing inside your belly .
next time i cut it off .
the infant is our only hope .
get the child to safety .
get the child to safety ,
and on its ... 28th birthday ,
the child will return .
the child will find you ,
and the final battle will begin !
i &apos;ve heard enough . we &apos;re leaving .
hey ! you ! we made a deal !
i want her name ! we had a deal !
i need her name ! h @-@ h @-@ her name !
&quot; her &quot; ?
it &apos;s a boy .
missy . missy , you know i &apos;m right .
tell me .
what &apos;s her name ?
emma .
her name is emma .
emma .
童话镇
okay , kid . how about an address ?
44 i &apos;m @-@ not @-@ telling @-@ you street .
look , it &apos;s been a long night ,
and it &apos;s almost ...
8 : 15 ?
that clock hasn &apos;t moved in my whole life .
time &apos;s frozen here .
excuse me ?
the evil queen did it with her curse .
she sent everyone from the enchanted forest here .
hang on .
an evil queen sent a bunchch of fairy tale characters here ?
yeah , and now they &apos;re trapped .
frozen in time
and stuck in storybrooke , maine--
that &apos;s what you &apos;re going with ?
it &apos;s true .
then why doesn &apos;t everybody just leave ?
they can &apos;t .
if they try , bad things happen .
henry .
what are you doing here ?
is everything all right ?
i &apos;m fine , archie .
who is this ?
just someone trying to give him a ride home .
oh , she &apos;s my mom , archie .
oh . i see .
do you know where he lives ?
yeah , sure . just right up on mifflin street .
the mayor &apos;s house is the biggest one on the block .
you &apos;re the mayor &apos;s kid ?
uh , maybe .
hey , where were you today , henry ?
&apos;cause you missed our session .
oh , well , i forgot to tell you , i went on a field trip .
henry ...
what did i tell you about lying ?
giving in to one &apos;s dark side
never accomplishes anything .
okay .
well , i really should be getting him home .
yeah , sure .
well , listen , have a good night ,
and , you be good , henry .
so that &apos;s your shrink ?
i &apos;m not crazy .
didn &apos;t say that .
just ... he doesn &apos;t seem cursed to me .
maybe he &apos;s just trying to help you .
he &apos;s the one who needs help ,
because he doesn &apos;t know .
that he &apos;s a fairy tale character ?
none of them do .
they don &apos;t remember who they are .
convenient .
all right . i &apos;ll play . who &apos;s he supposed to be ?
jiminy cricket .
right . the lying thing .
i thought your nose grew a little bit .
i &apos;m not pinocchio .
of course you &apos;re not , &apos; cause that would be ridiculous .
i say , we fight !
fighting is a bad idea .
giving in to one &apos;s dark side
never accomplishes anything .
and how many wars has a clear conscience won ?
we need to take the queen out
before she can inflict her curse .
can we even trust rumplestiltskin ?
i &apos;ve sent my men into the forest .
the animals are abuzz with the queen &apos;s plan .
this is going to happen ,
unless we do something .
there &apos;s no point .
the future is written .
no . i refuse to believe that .
good can &apos;t just lose .
maybe it can .
no . no .
not as long as we have each other .
if you believe him about the curse ,
then you must believe him about our child .
she will be the savior .
what the hell is this ?
our only hope of saving that child .
a tree ? our fate rests on a tree ?
let &apos;s get back to the fighting thing .
the tree is enchanted .
if fashioned into a vessel ,
it can ward off any curse .
geppetto , can you build such a thing ?
me and my boy-- we can do it .
this will work . we all must have faith .
there is , however , a catch .
the enchantment is indeed powerful ,
but all power has its limits ,
and this tree can protect only one .
please don &apos;t take me back there .
i have to .
i &apos;m sure your parents are worried sick about you .
i don &apos;t have parents-- just a mom , and she &apos;s evil .
evil ? that &apos;s a bit extreme , isn &apos;t it ?
she is . she doesn &apos;t love me .
she only pretends to .
kid .
i &apos;m sure that &apos;s not true .
henry ?
oh , henry .
ohh . are you okay ?
where have you been ? !
what happened ?
i found my real mom !
y @-@ you &apos;re henry &apos;s birth mother ?
i &apos;ll just go and check on the lad , make sure he &apos;s all right .
how would you like a glass of the best apple cider you ever tasted ?
got anything stronger ?
how did he find me ?
no idea .
when i adopted him , he was only 3 weeks old .
the records were sealed .
i was told the birth mother didn &apos;t want to have any contact .
you wewe told right .
and the father ?
there was one .
do i need to be worried about him ?
nope . he doesn &apos;t even know .
do i need to be worried about you , ms. swan ?
absolutely not .
madame mayor , you can relax .
other than being a tired little boy , henry &apos;s fine .
thank you , sheriff .
i &apos;m sorry he dragged you out of your life .
i really don &apos;t know what &apos;s gotten into him .
kid &apos;s having a rough time . it happens .
you have to understand , ever since i became mayor ,
balancing things has been tricky .
you have a job , i assume ?
uh , i keep busy , yeah .
imagine having another one on top of it ,
that &apos;s being a single mom .
so i push for order .
am i strict ?
i suppose , but i do it for his own good .
i want henry to excel in life .
i don &apos;t think that makes me evil , do you ?
i &apos;m sure he &apos;s just saying that
because of the fairy tale thing .
what fairy tale thing ?
oh , you know , his book ,
how he thinks everyone &apos;s a cartoon character from it ,
like his shrink is jiminy cricket .
i &apos;m sorry . i really have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
you know what ? it &apos;s none of my business .
he &apos;s your kid ,
and i really should be heading back .
of course .
sneaky bastard .
i don &apos;t want to do this .
it has to be you .
i &apos;m not leaving you .
it &apos;s the only way .
you &apos;ll go in there , and you &apos;ll be safe from the curse .
he said it would be on her 28th birthday .
what &apos;s 28 years ,
when you have eternal love ?
i got faith .
you will save me , as i did you .
what is it ?
the baby .
she &apos;s coming .
wake up .
wake up !
look !
the curse ! it &apos;s here !
what are you looking at , sister ?
hey , leroy . manners . we have a guest .
so you are , uh , henry &apos;s mother ?
how lovely for him to have you back in his life .
actually i was just dropping him off .
don &apos;t blame ya .
they &apos;re all brats . who needs &apos; em ?
well , i &apos;d give anything for one .
my wife and i-- we tried for many years ,
but , uh ... it was not meant to be .
well , cry me a river .
leroy , i &apos;m going to let you out . you need to behave .
put on a smile , and stay out of trouble .
seriously ?
regina &apos;s drinks--
a little stronger than we thought .
i wasn &apos;t drunk .
there was a wolf standing in the middle of the road .
a wolf . right .
graham , henry &apos;s run away again . we have to--
what is she doing here ?
do you know where he is ?
lady , i haven &apos;t seen him since i dropped him at your house ,
and i have a pretty good alibi .
yeah , well , he wasn &apos;t in his room this morning .
did you try his friends ?
he doesn &apos;t really have any . he &apos;s kind of a loner .
every kid has friends .
did you check his computer ?
if he &apos;s close to someone , he &apos;d be e @-@ mailing them .
and you know this how ?
finding people is what i do . here &apos;s an idea .
how about you guys let me out , and i &apos;ll help you find him ?
smart kid . he cleared his in @-@ box .
i &apos;m smart , too .
a little hard disk recovery utility i like to use .
i &apos;m a bit more old @-@ fashioned in my techniques .
pounding the pavement , knocking on doors , that sort of thing .
you &apos;re on salary . i get paid for delivery .
pounding the pavement is not a luxury that i get .
huh . there &apos;s a receipt for a web site .
&quot; who &apos;s your momma.org &quot;
it &apos;s expensive . he has a credit card ?
he &apos;s 10 .
well , he used one .
let &apos;s pull up a transaction record .
&quot; mary margaret blanchard . &quot;
who &apos;s mary margaret blanchard ?
henry &apos;s teacher .
as we build our birdhouses , remember ,
what you &apos;re making is a home , not a cage .
the bird is free and will do what it will .
this is for them , not us .
they &apos;re loyal creatures .
if you love them and they love you ,
they will always find you .
we &apos;ll pick this up after recess . no running .
well , thank you .
ms. mills , what are you doing here ?
where &apos;s my son ?
henry ? i assumed he was home sick with you .
you think i &apos;d be here if he was ?
did you give him your credit card so he can find her ?
i &apos;m sorry . who are you ?
i &apos;m his ... i &apos;m his ...
the woman who gave him up for adoption .
you don &apos;t know anything about this , do you ?
no , unfortunately not .
clever boy .
i should never have given him that book .
what in the hell is this book i keep hearing about ?
just some old stories i gave him .
as you well know , henry is a special boy .
so smart , so creative ,
and as you might be aware ... lonely .
he needed it .
what he needs is a dose of reality .
this is a waste of time .
have a nice trip back to boston .
sorry to bother you .
no , it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s okay . i fear this is partially my fault .
how &apos;s a book supposed to help ?
what do you think stories are for ?
these stories ...
the classics .
there &apos;s a reason we all know them .
they &apos;re a way for us to deal with our world ,
a world that doesn &apos;t always make sense .
see , henry hasn &apos;t had the easiest life .
yeah , she &apos;s kind of a hard @-@ ass .
no , it &apos;s more than her .
he &apos;s like any adopted child .
he wrestles with that
most basic question they all inevitably face
&quot; why would anyone give me away ? &quot;
i am so sorry .
i &apos;m so sorry . i didn &apos;t mean in any way to judge you .
it &apos;s okay .
look , i gave the book to him because i wanted henry to have
the most important thing
anyone can have ... hope .
believing in even the possibility
of a happy ending is a very powerful thing .
you know where he is , don &apos;t you ?
you might want to check his castle .
no .
no . i can &apos;t ...
have this baby now .
doc , do something .
it &apos;s gonna be okay .
the wardrobe &apos;s almost finished . just--just hold on .
it &apos;s ready .
it &apos;s too late . we can &apos;t move her .
push .
the wardrobe .
it only takes one .
then our plan has failed .
at least we &apos;re together .
no . you have to take her .
take the baby to the wardrobe .
are you out of your mind ?
no . it &apos;s the only way . you have to send her .
no .
no , no , no , no . you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re saying .
no , i do .
we have to believe that she &apos;ll come back for us .
we have to give her her best chance .
good @-@ bye , emma .
find us .
you left this in my car .
still hasn &apos;t moved , huh ?
i was hoping that when i brought you back ,
things would change here ,
that the final battle would begin .
i &apos;m not fighting any battles , kid .
yes , you are . you &apos;re here because it &apos;s your destiny .
you &apos;re gonna bring back the happy endings .
can you cut it with the book crap ?
you don &apos;t have to be hostile .
i know you like me . i can tell .
you &apos;re just pushing me away because i make you feel guilty .
it &apos;s okay .
i know why you gave me away .
you wanted to give me my best chance .
how do you know that ?
it &apos;s the same reason snow white gave you away .
listen to me , kid .
i am not in any book .
i &apos;m a real person .
and i &apos;m no savior .
you were right about one thing , though .
i wanted you to have your best chance .
but it &apos;s not with me .
come on . let &apos;s go .
please don &apos;t take me back there .
just stay with me for one week . that &apos;s all i ask .
one week , and you &apos;ll see i &apos;m not crazy .
i have to get you back to your mom .
you don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like with her . my life sucks .
oh , you want to know what sucking is ?
being left abandoned on the side of a freeway .
my parents didn &apos;t even bother to drop me off at a hospital .
i ended up in the foster system
and i had a family until i was 3,
but then they had their own kid ,
so they sent me back .
look ...
your mom is trying her best .
i know it &apos;s hard ,
and i know sometimes you think she doesn &apos;t love you ,
but at least she wants you .
your parents didn &apos;t leave you on the side of the freeway .
that &apos;s just where you came through .
what ?
the wardrobe . when you went through the wardrobe ,
you appeared in the street .
your parents were trying to save you from the curse .
sure they were .
come on , henry .
no .
no .
no !
no !
no . no .
no . no . no . no .
please .
please come back to me .
what ?
oh , don &apos;t worry , dear .
in a few moments , you won &apos;t remember you knew him ,
let alone loved him .
why did you do this ?
because this is my happy ending .
the child ?
gone . it was in the wardrobe , and then it was gone .
it &apos;s nowhere to be found .
where is she ?
she got away .
you &apos;re going to lose .
i know that now .
good will always win .
we &apos;ll see about that .
where are we going ?
somewhere horrible .
absolutely horrible .
a place where the only happy ending will be mine .
thank you .
no problem .
he seemed to have taken quite a shine to you .
you know what &apos;s kinda crazy ?
yesterday was my birthday ,
and when i blew out the candle on this cupcake i bought myself ,
i actually made a wish
that i didn &apos;t have to be alone on my birthday .
and then henry showed up .
i hope there &apos;s no misunderstanding here .
i &apos;m sorry ?
don &apos;t mistake all this as an invitation back into his life .
ms. swan , you made a decision ten years ago .
and in the last decade , while you &apos;ve been ...
well , who knows what you &apos;ve been doing ?
i &apos;ve changed every diaper ,
soothed every fever , endured every tantrum .
you may have given birth to him , but he is my son .
i was not ...
no ,
you don &apos;t get to speak .
you don &apos;t get to do anything .
you gave up that right when you tossed him away .
do you know what a closed adoption is ?
it &apos;s what you asked for .
you have no legal right to henry ,
and you &apos;re gonna be held to that .
so i suggest you get in your car and you leave this town ,
because if you don &apos;t ,
i will destroy you if it is the last thing i do .
good @-@ bye , ms. swan .
do you love him ?
excuse me ?
henry .
do you love him ?
of course i love him .
you &apos;re out all night , and now you &apos;re going out again .
i should &apos;ve moved to boston !
i &apos;m sorry that my heart attack interfered with your plans
to sleep your way down the eastern seaboard .
excuse me ?
i &apos;d like a room .
really ?
would you like a forest view or a square view ?
normally , there &apos;s an upgrade fee for the square ,
but as rent is due , i &apos;ll waive it .
square is fine .
now ... what &apos;s the name ?
swan . emma swan .
emma .
what a lovely name .
thanks .
it &apos;s all here .
yes , yes , of course . yes , dear , thank you .
you enjoy your stay ...
emma .
who &apos;s that ?
mr. gold . he owns this place .
the inn ?
no . the town .
so how long will you be with us ?
a week .
just a week .
great .
welcome to storybrooke .
