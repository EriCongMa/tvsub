2011年美国喜剧电影

is carefully hidden in tonight &apos;s episode ,
like a bread crumb lodged inside my stomach crease .

第二十三季 第一集
what the ... ?
quiet steps are what i take
sneaking in at noon
just in time for my lunch break
got my fork and spoon
time the cameras just right
duck in the bathroom
hi , homer !
i &apos;m still drunk from last night
got driven home
i don &apos;t know by whom
some may say
i don &apos;t deserve any pay
but hey
i came up with &apos; 60s day
last may .
while i &apos;m here , i might as well pre @-@ punch out .
hmm , we &apos;ve had a lot of bills lately .
better put in some overtime .
larry , my man !
hey , you &apos;re not larry .
how come you &apos;re not larry ?
i wouldn &apos;t know , sir .
uh , listen , if you could indulge me ,
larry and i fist @-@ bump every morning .
like that .
the warmth of human contact
with a manly whiff of violence .
not interested .
hey , what &apos;s with that new security guard ?
he &apos;s acting all aloof .
uh , by the way , that &apos;s my word of the day : &quot; he &apos;s . &quot;
maybe i was a little hard on him ,
expecting him to be larry right away .
by the way , where is larry ?
crazy house . violent ward .
good ol &apos; larry .
say ... wayne ,
i couldn &apos;t help but notice
that your breath doesn &apos;t smell like alcohol .
you want to go grab a beer after work ?
i prefer not to have social interaction with coworkers .
it , um , hasn &apos;t worked out for me in the past .
well , maybe he just doesn &apos;t like fist @-@ bumping .
hey , wayne .
as god as my witness , this fist will be bumped !
put that fool thing down .
we now return to
master chef : extreme snack edition .
marge , your ratio of peanut butter
to cracker was spot on .
and i loved the addition of the thin slice of apple .
this was a great plate of food .
thank you .
this is my third favorite reality cooking show .
for your prize , you have won a brand @-@ new kitchen ,
which i will now become .
i miss my soul patch .
kids , enjoy your extreme snack .
wait , this tastes different .
i put a slice of apple in it .
gross .
you know i hate surprises .
you tricked us .
i like routine . i like routine .
did you have a hard day , too ?
ah , a guy at work seems not to like me .
i guess it &apos;s not much
when you look at real problems in the world ,
like major league umpires not using instant replay .
it &apos;s big to you .
would you like a get well pork chop ?
i love you so much .
potatoes and gravy on the side , please .
charlie , want to grab a beer ?
no , i was tipsy last night when a telephone survey called ,
so i told them to call back tonight
for more accurate answers .
oh . okay .
wayne !
want a ride ?
i can walk .
all right , homer , you win .
you know ,
i just got a little chill when you said my name .
every town i go to ,
i run into some guy just like this .
look , i &apos;m not weird or anything ,
i just like to feel like i &apos;m friends with everybody .
homer , you &apos;re a nice guy .
i &apos;ll have one beer with you .
after that , we will have
a courteous professional relationship , and that &apos;s it .
no secret santa , we &apos;re not trading lunches ,
and i don &apos;t want you
calling me at home and saying &quot; turn on channel six . &quot;
but what if the weather girl ...
i don &apos;t care !
wow , i can &apos;t believe homer bagged the tiger .
excuse me , i need to use the ...
men &apos;s room !
oh , my god .
we &apos;re completing each other &apos;s ...
completing each other &apos;s ...
sen ... ten ... ces ...
totally surprising entrance !
hand over your cash and jewelry .
pronto .
okay , now , don &apos;t want no trouble .
let me just get my cash out of my cash drawer here .
just , uh , lining up all the presidents , nice and neat .
ain &apos;t trying to be no hero .
uh , here you go .
thanks for the upgrade .
wayne ?
stand back , homer !
i know what i &apos;m doing .
well , we all know what we &apos;re doing .
the question is ,
is it an appropriate reaction to the situation ?
my fresco !
that &apos;s coming out of your stealings !
wayne , maybe it &apos;s the me being still alive talking ,
but i think you &apos;re awesome .
i &apos;m just a guy who saw what needed to be done and did it .
oh , speaking of which ,
let &apos;s get these eggs back in a jar .
wow , that &apos;s the farthest that one of my eggs
ever made it down someone &apos;s throat .
it &apos;s great to have a home @-@ cooked meal .
well , if anyone saves my homie &apos;s life ,
they get a free meal .
which actually comes up about once a week .
so , wayne , how &apos;d you learn
all those cool self @-@ defense moves ?
i had training .
special training .
the kind they &apos;re not allowed to give anymore .
sorry .
i have to go .
oh , come on , stay for dessert !
hey , simpson ,
you want to hear about the big change in my life ?
sure , why not .
i started drinking orange juice with pulp .
i asked the reverend , and he said it was okay .
then he hung right up on me .
that man is cranky at 3 : 00 in the morning .
and here he is , this week &apos;s noble nobody .
what the ...
a quiet , unassuming security guard
who foiled a robbery at a local tavern ,
as seen in this taiwanese animated dramatization .
please , sir , just let me do my job .
pish tush .
wayne , as a reward for your valiant fisticuffery ,
i hereby award you
the springfield nuclear plant silver safety hat .
thanks to you , wayne ,
we did not lose the visible half of the moon .
just doing my job , sir .
all too well .
i &apos;m afraid that protocol demands
that i totally erase your memory .
die , you fascist bastard !
mother , is that you ?
wayne , stop ! that &apos;s mr. burns !
i expect insolence , but rank insolence ?
off with his job !
damn it .
why don &apos;t you come stay with us
till you can get back on your feet ?
really ? are you sure ?
of course .
i mean , how long could it be ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;ve got no job , no references , can &apos;t afford my apartment .
it &apos;s best to concentrate on what you do have .
i have reoccurring flashbacks to a nightmarish past .
that &apos;s funny , because i have
reoccurring flash @-@ forwards to a nightmarish future .
unfair ! unfair !
that robot took our jobs !
he said it .
or , uh , maybe it was him .
man , this robot really gets me .
my nightmares are real .
your voice is so gravelly ,
just like lauren bacall &apos;s .
if you don &apos;t listen to me , senator ,
there &apos;s not going to be a fourth of july !
don &apos;t you get it ? he used the governor &apos;s eyeball
for the retinal scan !
that &apos;s ten members of the electoral college
dead in one day !
if you don &apos;t give me those launch codes ,
you &apos;ll never be able to make the &quot; okay &quot; sign again .
i know the map is inside your eyelids ,
and i will turn them inside out if i have to !
if you move that little top hat to st. james place ,
we &apos;ll all be blown to kingdom come !
bring me every fish in that aquarium !
one of them is lying !
i &apos;m sorry i have so many nightmares .
i &apos;ve done unspeakable things ,
from buenos aires to the ukraine .
well , what brought you to springfield ?
was it our frito @-@ lay distribution center ?
i needed somewhere to lie low .
your town appears on no maps or charts .
yeah , they couldn &apos;t find a google map photo
without me naked or urinating .
and when there was a mapmaker &apos;s convention here ,
they all got lou gehrig &apos;s disease .
not the one you &apos;re thinking of ...
there &apos;s another one .
so , lisa , if you press on bart &apos;s elbow ,
here ,
he &apos;ll tell you anything you want to know .
i admit it ! i let milhouse
lie down in your bed !
kids , can i talk to wayne alone a minute ?
remember everything they say ,
and tell us later in rattle code .
what do you mean , &quot; no &quot; ?
i don &apos;t know if you should teach our children
advanced interrogation techniques .
i &apos;m sorry , marge .
sometimes i forget where i am .
apology accepted .
now , could you teach me a couple little driving tricks ?
we &apos;ll see who gets their pick
of pizza pockets !
give us your lunch money !
what gives , man ?
where &apos;d you learn that stuff ?
if i told you , i &apos;d have to kill you .
can i tell you ?
no ! i won &apos;t listen !
we can &apos;t keep serving the same thing every day .
these kids have mashed potatoes coming out of their ears .
point taken .
oh , my god . that song .
i can &apos;t live in the real world anymore .
this is the real world ?
hallelujah ! i &apos;m still alive !
ha @-@ ha ! and i &apos;ll appreciate every moment !
except the ones that aren &apos;t as good as they used to be .
which is all of them .
oh , someone kill me .
ah , junk , junk .
beyonc confirms she will play at my daughter &apos;s sweet 16 party .
humorous youtube sent by my brother .
mildly funny , at best .
eh , sometimes they are good for giggle .
&quot; auto @-@ tune disaster victim . &quot;
&quot; crazy man attacks boss . &quot;
it &apos;s him .
american agent who caused the death of everyone i loved !
you want to give it zero stars ?
no ! we will go to ...
springfield , america ,
and kill this man .
but first ...
out the dog poo
sure beats picking it up
flanders &apos; driveway
is my goal
i am looking for a man named wayne .
oh . he &apos;s gone . i don &apos;t know where he went .
are you friend of his ?
he has no friends .
except me !
i see you are tight like borscht and beets .
tell me , if we kidnapped a friend of wayne &apos;s ,
would he attempt to rescue that friend ?
well , i suppose if the friend was being horribly tortured ...
h @-@ hey , wha ? wha ? wha ?
no ! not the middle seat !
this just in : a local man has been kidnapped
by ukrainian gangsters .
we &apos;ve received the following video .
death to america !
stick to script .
fine .
i am being held somewhere in the springfield area .
turn the card .
hold up today &apos;s newspaper .
what will you guys use when there aren &apos;t newspapers anymore ?
perhaps we will be living
in a world where there &apos;ll be no need to kidnap .
oh , well , way to make me feel obsolete .
oh , look-- here &apos;s a coupon for scissors
that you have to cut out ! thanks , geniuses !
shut up .
hey , hey , hey , what are you doing !
this is no way to treat the talent .
shut up !
oh , god .
i know that voice .
viktor ?
darling , i told you to stay in your room .
i told you the bedspread smells funny .
nyet ... !
marge ...
i &apos;ll get your husband back .
how are you going to find him ?
homer is implanted with several highly powerful tracking chips .
how did that happen ?
i left that out in a bowl and he ate them .
i &apos;d take a moment to enjoy those store names
if i didn &apos;t have a job to do .
get out of here !
aah ! i won a silver medal in nagano--
ow ! -- and now this !
oh ... cold ...
so cold ...
so , wayne ,
once again you crash my party ?
so cold ! warm me up !
stop it !
just let me put my hands
under your armpits .
so much violence on the surface world .
i &apos;m going back .
cold ... so cold ...
now you can see why i can &apos;t stay in one place .
not here , not anywhere .
how about living on a train that &apos;s always moving ?
you ever eat on a train , marge ?
what they call a steak
is barely a hamburger . now , homer ,
there &apos;s one more thing before i go .
that &apos;s what i call closure .
good @-@ bye .
yes , maggie , we will have a use for you soon .
stay close to your busy box .
wait !
i know a place you can go !
a place where a sadistic man with government experience
can feel right at home .
sir , this is the wrong form .
can you hold my space while i go get the right one ?
nobody held my space when i was in a north korean prison
being forced to write a musical about kim jung il
with a car battery hooked up to my nipples !
词曲 韦恩 · 斯莱特
well ...
pardon me , sir ,
can you tell me where palace is ?
what business do you have at the palace ?
why , someday i &apos;m going to be dear leader .
you ? you are too benevolent to be dear leader !
let &apos;s see what they think .
k &quot; is korea , just the north par
&quot; i &quot; is for the internet he bans
&quot; m &quot; is for the millions that are missing
j &quot; is for a human @-@ tasting jam
&quot; o &quot; is for oh , boy , we love our leader
&quot; n &quot; is for the best korea , north ?
&quot; g &quot; is for gee whiz , we love our leader , mmm ...
we just wanted to give you all a big thank you from team nedna .
it &apos;s nice to know people still believe in love .
now , wait just a minute--
how come i wasn &apos;t an option in this contest ?
typical seymour !
waits till the polls have closed
before throwing his hat in the ring .
i agree with america : you &apos;ll never give me a grandchild .
thank you .
