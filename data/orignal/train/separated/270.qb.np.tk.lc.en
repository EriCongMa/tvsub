i like the lemon . so good .
and with the vanilla frosting ,
it would make a lovely cupcake wedding cake .

i &apos;m gonna get some water ,
and then i &apos;ll be back to taste everything !

it &apos;s a scam .
i know her game .
there isn &apos;t a denny &apos;s on the eastern seaboard
i haven &apos;t hit up and said it &apos;s my birthday
for a free sundae .
well , what if you &apos;re wrong ,
and she is the real deal ?
a cupcake wedding cake could be a lot of money .
we have to crack her b.s.
before she eats our cupcakes , and then us .
follow my lead .
oh ! what are we tasting now ?
coconut .
what &apos;s your fiance &apos;s name ?
doug franklin .
where &apos;d you meet ?
he &apos;s a fireman .
he rescued my cat .
no , aw . that &apos;s an insurance commmmercia .
so where &apos;s the wedding ?
barefoot on the beach .
that &apos;s a tampon commercial .
ooh ! hi , baby !
max , you &apos;re wrong . they &apos;re kissing .
nope , he &apos;s either an out @-@ of @-@ work actor she hired ,
or he has cake in his mouth .
i have an announcement to make .
you found your first &quot; down there &quot; hair ?
no , it &apos;s the last chance to put in your business card
to win a luxury weekend vacation .
it &apos;s han &apos;s big promo .
well , he &apos;s finally announced it .
han &apos;s a big promo .
well , he &apos;s a little promo .
good luck , you now have a chance
to win a fancy two @-@ room suite in the country ,
and there &apos;s a fireplace because daddy don &apos;t skimp .
aw , i miss our fireplace in the country .
my father and i would sit together ,
and i &apos;d roast marshmallows , and then he &apos;d burn
what i now realize must &apos;ve been incriminating documents .
hi , everybody ! the raffle girl is here .
oh , i get to pull the winner !
she pulled me twice today ,
and i won both times .
sophie , the way you look tonight ,
we are all winners .
oh , earl , that is so sweet .
i would kiss you if it was legal .
all right , i &apos;m going to put in one of my cleaning company cards .
all right .
who &apos;s gonna be the winner ?
yeah , yeah , shake it like a polaroid picture , baby .
yeah .
oh , no , that doesn &apos;t feel like my card .
sophie , that &apos;s cheating .
hey , keep out of it , glinda the good bitch .
and the winner is ...
max &apos;s homemade cupcakes ?
oh , my god ! we won !
congratulations !
i &apos;ve never won anything in my life !
except for that time i got stoned
and accidentally won that hot dog eating contest .
wait , how did this even happen ?
did you put our card in ?
actually , i put your card in ,
and i took a few out .
i figured you girls could use a vacation .
you girls been working harder than my liver on payday .
oh , earl , you &apos;re like santa
without the weird fixation on children .
it was so nice of earl to enter us .
oh , stop . he &apos;s like my father .
wow , this place actually looks nice .
ooh , an outhouse !
max , that &apos;s a sauna . oh .
either way , i &apos;m peeing in it .
but max , can we leave the shop ?
i mean , even though business has been slow ,
what if dottie wants to come back
and order cupcakes for her wedding ?
first off , she ate them all .
second , there is no wedding .
she &apos;s a b.s. bride .
i guarantee you , right now ,
she &apos;s crawling through an air @-@ conditioning vent
at a krispy kreme .
andy in the house !
sorry , i was watching a living single marathon
before i came over .
you are not gonna believe this .
we won a weekend getaway .
isn &apos;t that exciting ? we really needed this .
that &apos;s great !
we do need this . thanks , babe .
and i was hoping to get a little special
one @-@ on @-@ one time with you this weekend .
so when do we leave ?
oh , we !
we can leave tomorrow .
we--we--we all the way there .
look , han said it was a two @-@ room suite .
andy can come with us .
it &apos;s still our trip .
he doesn &apos;t have to know he &apos;s the third wheel .
well , you know i &apos;m always a fan of lying ,
so i &apos;m in .
it &apos;s still our trip .
she doesn &apos;t have to know she &apos;s the third wheel .
well , you know i &apos;m not a fan of lying ,
but okay , i &apos;m in .
i love a road trip .
my mom and i took one in third grade for , like , a year ,
but we &apos;d just drive around locally and--
oh , my god , i lived in a car .
hey , let &apos;s play a card game .
i spy something red .
is it that gas station ?
nope .
is it that truck ?
nope .
is it boring ? yes ! my turn .
i spy something annoying .
is it me ?
yes !
i knew the joke was on me ,
but i love to win .
you are not annoying . you &apos;re adorable .
i spy a big man @-@ gina .
is it me ?
yes !
like to win too .
max &apos;s homemade cupcakes .
hello ?
bad cell area .
max , i think that might &apos;ve been dottie , the b.s. bride .
i couldn &apos;t hear the words ,
but she sounded unnaturally confident .
maybe the b.s. stands for &quot; big sale . &quot;
no more business calls , okay ?
i thought we were getting away for fun .
we are , but our business
is nowhere near where we need it to be ,
and when it comes to ignoring a call ,
it &apos;s kind of hard .
hey , you know what this area of the mountains is known for ?
wineries and incest ?
alien abductions !
i know all about it .
people disappear from here all the time .
max , there &apos;s no such thing as an extraterrestrial .
okay , first , that &apos;s something an extraterrestrial would say .
i &apos;ve always wanted to be abducted .
and my guidance counselor said i had no goals .
and here we go .
again , i don &apos;t believe in names ,
but feel free to call me &quot; roger &quot; if it helps you .
yeah ! get out ! get out !
the bed floats ! this is awesome !
usually , you gotta bring the ropes to the bed .
this way , you get to eliminate a whole step !
the bed &apos;s sculptural beauty
is actually surpassed by the joy of resting in it .
some say it &apos;s like being rocked to sleep
in the arms of god .
it &apos;s a sex bed , roger .
may i light the fire for you ?
oh , no , thanks . i can do it .
i was an eagle scout .
man , there &apos;s just not enough occasions
where i can brag about at .
the room is cute , but really tiny .
we &apos;re gonna need a bigger space ,
unless we &apos;re hobbits .
is this the door to the adjoining room ?
well , that is an adjoining room ,
but it &apos;s not included in your package .
oh , damn it !
we should &apos;ve known han &apos;s package
was gonna be smaller than he said it is .
i &apos;m sorry . all the other cabins are booked .
i &apos;ll bring you some bedding for the couch
at an additional price .
ohm shanti .
well , i guess you guys are the couple ,
so i &apos;ll sleep on the couch .
i can sleep anywhere .
first two years of my life ,
my bed was a pile of unopened mail .
a big , roaring fire
is gonna be so romantic .
come over here closer to me ,
you big eagle scout .
well , now you sound like my scoutmaster .
hey , don &apos;t start anything you can &apos;t finish in a minute .
max &apos;ll be right out .
something tells me she &apos;s not a consistent hand @-@ washer .
you do your thing .
i &apos;m just gonna sit right here ,
and watch my man build a fire .
oh , great , this is cedar !
it &apos;s gonna smell so awesome .
i love falling asleep to the sound of a fire .
oh , my god .
i know , no business stuff ,
but i just got a text about a big order .
that &apos;s fine , just remember this weekend--
oh , i know , me and you .
me and you , me and you--
max ! max .
turns out the b.s. bride isn &apos;t b.s.
she wants pricing on a wedding cupcake cake ,
and a groom &apos;s cupcake cake , for 300 guests .
great !
almost as great as these little fuzzy shoes !
they were in a sealed plastic package .
i &apos;m the first one to ever open them .
they &apos;re like condoms for your feet !
new shoes , new shoes
where are you going ?
to the sauna .
hopefully , i &apos;ll be abducted on my way ,
but know that even though i &apos;m gone ,
i &apos;m happier up there with my alien lover .
true , they don &apos;t have lips ,
but they do have crazy @-@ long fingers .
i &apos;ll go with you .
not to talk about work ,
but she can &apos;t go alone . there might be bears .
there were always bears at my chalet in aspen ,
in the woods , lying on the floors , everywhere .
you know , until peta attacked the house .
so this is a fancy sauna ?
not impressed .
people pay for the privilege
of sitting in decades of ass sweat ?
how come your towel &apos;s staying up
so much better than mine ?
i can think of two reasons .
i &apos;m gonna get some water , and then start peeing .
when you come back , we have to discuss
the b.s. bride &apos;s cake .
we can &apos;t screw this up . it &apos;s all we have .
this heat is amazing .
mother of god ! that &apos;s hot .
there are bears out there .
they &apos;re coming this way .
what ?
max , get in here ! close the door !
fine , but they &apos;ll just open it and come in .
bears can &apos;t open doors and walk in .
these ones can .
oh , hi .
hey , girls .
you mind if we join you ?
you guys are gay bears , right ?
max !
it &apos;s cool .
my prom date is big in the bear scene now ,
but in high school , they just called him a jock
who cried sometimes .
yep , we &apos;re bears . big , hairy , not scary .
i &apos;m deke . this is dirk .
yup , we &apos;re deke and dirk .
pause for reaction .
i &apos;m caroline , and this is max .
are you girls lipstick lesbians ?
no , we &apos;re just friends ,
and we can &apos;t afford lipstick .
especially at this gift shop .
have you seen the prices ?
$ 25 for chap stick ?
please . no one &apos;s lips are that chapped .
and he would know .
this one &apos;s the king of face creaming .
a little bit dirtier than what it is .
i &apos;m actually a dermatologist .
oh , my god .
do not tell me i &apos;m lucky enough
to be in a sauna with two dermatologists .
oh , no , no , no , no , no .
i &apos;m an astrophysicist .
oh , smarter than the average bear .
loving her .
so you know about space stuff , smarty bear .
do you believe in aliens ?
oh , i do , and i believe they &apos;re living among us .
i &apos;m looking at you , christina ricci !
so talk to me , deke . what can you give me ?
he has plenty of free cream samples
back in our room .
and it &apos;s the good stuff . you should come by !
we &apos;re in cabin four .
no way ! we &apos;re in cabin three .
how about those rope beds ?
you know it &apos;s kinky when the bed is already tied up .
first , we were all &quot; um , we &apos;re gonna fall , &quot;
but then we thought , &quot; what the hell ?
it &apos;s our man @-@ iversary . &quot;
aw , you &apos;re married ?
happy anniversary .
now , let &apos;s get back to those free creams .
oh , and here &apos;s our card
if you &apos;re ever in the neighborhood
or need a big order .
you brought a business card to a sauna ?
i don &apos;t wanna know where you kept that .
max &apos;s homemade cupcakes .
or in your case , cub @-@ cakes .
loving her .
living for her .
wanna come back as her .
there you go , your dinner for two .
two soups , two salads , two entrees , two desserts .
i hope you three enjoy .
maybe could we order another meal ?
no problem , just call .
extra charge , of course .
ohm shanti .
ohm shanti means &quot; screw you &quot; in yoga , right ?
i am so starving .
oh , my god , this looks amazing !
oh , and the bread is still warm !
and there &apos;s one of those crazy @-@ ass pretzel rolls .
is it a pretzel ? is it a roll ?
no idea , it &apos;s crazy .
max , put some of this butter on it .
try and stop me , bitch !
here , take half .
thanks !
yo .
oh , my god , andy ! i totally forgot .
not about you . i forgot my manners .
if my danish governess were here ,
she would hit me with her wooden spoon .
i &apos;m so sorry .
go , sit . you eat .
enjoy the pretzel roll .
it &apos;s gone . you snooze , you lose .
no , you sit . i &apos;m good .
i &apos;ll order more food .
no , sit ! sit .
i &apos;m the bad one .
this soup is &quot; duh @-@ mazing . &quot;
just a word i made up
for when something &apos;s so amazing , you &apos;re stunned ,
and all you can say is &quot; duh . &quot;
duh @-@ mazing .
yes , i &apos;d like to order anoth--
yes , i &apos;ll hold .
i think the hold music is just roger singing .
okay , hang up the phone .
go sit and eat . come on .
hurry before max eats the table .
no , you eat .
after all , it &apos;s our special weekend .
i want you to enjoy it .
well , okay ,
but only because it &apos;s a special occasion .
good !
i &apos;m gonna go take a hot shower .
besides , it &apos;s always better to make love on an empty stomach .
that must be why there are so many people in india .
max , i got a favor to ask you .
do you think you can go visit your bear friends next door ,
maybe give us some private time ?
it &apos;ll be your birthday gift to me .
it would be my birthday gift to you
because it &apos;s your birthday .
yeah , just for , like , two hours .
okay , one hour .
i &apos;ll skip the foreplay ,
and that &apos;ll be my birthday gift to myself .
cool , then i &apos;ll just go do that , then .
i mean , caroline went to all this trouble
to get you a trip for your birthday , i assume .
i know ,
and i was really looking forward to some birthday sex
since we haven &apos;t really connected that way
since the shop started giving you guys so much trouble .
but the shop &apos;s been in trouble for weeks .
yeah , so maybe i &apos;ll only need , like , a half hour with her .
i need my book . i &apos;m gonna take a bath instead .
that tub is so amazing .
i &apos;m just gonna soak in it
and blissfully forget all my problems .
as well as some other things .
max is gonna go visit yogi and boo boo next door
and give us some private time .
she can &apos;t do that .
it &apos;s their man @-@ iversary .
they need their private time .
yes , but you guys
are celebrating a special thing , too .
what ? what are we celebrating ?
andy &apos;s birthday . oh , damn it !
now , i went and spoiled all the special sexual things
you had planned for him .
damn it , max !
now , you did give it all away .
we were gonna do missionary ,
and ...
... the other one .
okay .
okay , i &apos;m sorry . i forgot .
i don &apos;t know how . i knew today was your birthday .
it &apos;s tomorrow .
so yippee !
she hasn &apos;t missed it .
all &apos;s right with the world .
i &apos;m gonna go visit the berenstains .
this weekend wasn &apos;t about my birthday , was it ?
come on , come on .
get your hand out of his honeypot
and get over here .
i &apos;ll be gone in a second ,
and then you guys can jump @-@ start your sex life again .
what do you mean &quot; jump @-@ start &quot; ?
how could you tell max that we haven &apos;t had sex ?
you haven &apos;t even discussed that with me .
come on , aliens .
if you &apos;re ever going to abduct me ,
this would be the time .
don &apos;t take the attention off the fact
that you forgot my birthday .
oh , god , i wish i was a cartoon ,
so i could run right through this door ,
and leave behind a body @-@ shaped hole .
oh , hey , max .
mind if i hibernate for a minute ?
oh , sure , come on in .
we were just gonna eat and then dye our chest hair .
close that damn door now .
thanks , it was just getting a little tense in there .
she forgot his birthday .
mm , ouch .
well , he forgot mine once ,
and now it &apos;s his ankle tattoo .
max , please , i insist .
you don &apos;t have to ask me twice .
you gonna eat the pretzel roll ?
andy , i &apos;m sorry about your birthday .
it just went out of my head .
i feel bad .
and i feel sick .
can you stop swinging the bed ?
sorry , i &apos;m nervous .
yeah , you &apos;re nervous a lot ,
which is why our other bed isn &apos;t moving at all .
no , no , no , no , no , don &apos;t go .
come back . come back to the sex bed .
let &apos;s get some sex going !
come on ! we can get this bed moving now !
see !
see ?
oh , it &apos;s your birthday ! it &apos;s your birthday !
it &apos;s tomorrow .
okay . okay .
i can do better , see ?
here we go !
now , here we go !
wanna see me twerk it ?
if i &apos;d had any food , i would throw up .
okay , yeah , have a seat .
let &apos;s have some bread .
has it really been that long since we had sex ?
sweetie , after that dance ,
it &apos;s hard to believe you &apos;ve ever had sex .
it hasn &apos;t been that long .
the shop opened on the 12th ,
so it &apos;s ...
what ?
no , it &apos;s just interesting
you had no problem remembering that date .
let me ask you a question .
where do you think you &apos;re going ?
what do you mean ? i &apos;m here .
no .
where do you think you &apos;re going ?
like , where do you see your life in a year ?
well , pretty soon , max and i
will be out of this rough patch ,
and full force with the business ,
doing weddings and big events ,
and then max and i will probably open another store ,
get a bigger apartment .
okay , and am i in there somewhere ?
oh , come on . i was getting to you .
were you ?
when ? when were you getting to me ?
after your business is a success ?
no ! now .
come on . sex time in the sex bed .
wanna do it on the floor ?
this is so comfortable !
you put a belt on this , you could wear it out .
just don &apos;t try that at your in @-@ laws &apos; house
with a matching turban .
dirk , my father worked 40 years in the factory
before he lost his arm .
he doesn &apos;t get &quot; camp . &quot;
okay .
now get up here , lady .
we &apos;re having cookies and milk .
you guys rock .
i promise i won &apos;t stay here all night .
don &apos;t wanna get trapped in the middle
of your country bear jamboree .
please , honey .
you are perfectly safe in this bed .
we haven &apos;t had sex in a year .
why would you tell her that ?
well , she told us about her friends not having sex .
i thought it was on the table .
but we haven &apos;t even discussed that .
mother ship , make it happen !
this is the time to abduct me .
hi . max , you can come back . andy left .
he said he &apos;d find his own way home .
he left ?
because you &apos;re not having sex ?
max , you told the bears we &apos;re not having sex ?
why would you share that ?
exactly , caroline .
and why would you tell max that ,
与可能的未来带入此刻 然后直接去体验它们
when you never even brought it up in our gestalt therapy ?
i was planning on addressing it with you this weekend .
you think i &apos;d spend $ 500 on this room
for milk and cookies ?
i think we &apos;re all forgetting
how good that soup was .
well , i &apos;m sorry if i haven &apos;t been feeling very attractive lately .
i tell you how handsome you are every day .
don &apos;t you guys look exactly alike ?
are you okay ?
i &apos;m all right .
you wanna get in bed and cuddle for a little while ?
no , it &apos;s-- yeah .
come on .
yeah , get in here .
there you go . there you go .
oh , good . you &apos;re alive .
when i heard you left and walked through the woods ,
i wondered , &quot; was there anal probing ? &quot;
by an alien , not a grifter .
you texted you wanted to see me ?
well , someone did .
happy birthday !
now , come on , blow .
i don &apos;t really feel like doing that .
welcome to our world .
andy , i &apos;m so sorry about everything .
it &apos;s okay .
i had a lot of time to think on the bus ,
and the other bus , and the bus i had to take
when that bus broke down .
if it makes you feel any better ,
i have rope burns all down my back .
andy , i &apos;m sorry about your birthday .
we told each other those dates a month ago .
i wouldn &apos;t expect you to remember mine .
may 28th , 1987 .
10 : 30 in the morning .
10 : 30 at night , so you &apos;re not perfect .
look , you have a really busy life ,
and you &apos;re really ambitious , which i admire ,
but i wanna be more than someone you get to eventually .
and you deserve that .
it &apos;s just i have to put the business first right now--
and i get that .
i just--i think we should take a break .
you wanna take a break ?
maybe , yeah .
are you saying take a break
&apos;cause you really mean &quot; break up , &quot;
but you &apos;re trying to be nice ?
maybe , yeah .
i &apos;m sorry if this seems sudden ,
but i know me ,
and maybe it &apos;s better sooner than later .
i &apos;m back !
and i brought my bridesmaids !
looks like business is picking up .
it &apos;s gonna be hard not to see you .
yeah , it will be .
i work 10 feet away .
this way , ladies .
we &apos;re gonna taste every cupcake they have !
this is the time to take me !
come on , final offer !
e.t. ? alf ?
christina ricci ?
