you brokered the sale of a woman from the house of batiatus .
the mark of the domina upon the back of her shoulder .
where is she ?
we will find her , brother ,
and see everyone that has kept her from your arms to the afterlife .
we will see the romans bleed for taking us as dogs .
spartacus is enemy to us both .
the man takes habit of slipping through your fingers ,
what moves you to certainty of victory ?
because the gods themselves will it .
may the gods bless you .
there is but one place for an animal without honor .
you .
i come bearing a gift .
it should set you upon path to the fall of spartacus .
第三集
quiet your fucking bleating !
still yourself .
this how you came for the mine ?
by not heeding fucking command ?
see yourselves free .
you favor clever strategy .
fuck the man from behind .
a good start to the day .
i would see it built upon ...
i seek a woman named naevia .
she was cast out from the house of batiatus before its fall .
batiatus ?
you are spartacus ? !
i am crixus .
spartacus stands the fool beside me .
the woman he seeks is of rare beauty .
the mark of her domina upon her back .
she was carried from ...
spartacus tells a sword becomes lighter in time .
it is a heavy thing , to rob a man of life .
less so that of a roman shit .
stay close by .
i will help shoulder weight until we can--
the girl ...
naevia ...
her fate ...
known to me ...
speak it then .
spare a horse , and my life .
speak .
they add to our number .
yet not my cause .
we will find her .
words you have spoken many times
yet still ignored by the gods .
the man , he spoke of your woman .
what did he say ?
find fucking voice !
dead .
naevia is dead .
i cannot believe she is gone .
the gods again turn from those most worthy of blessing .
i hold no love for the man .
yet it tears heart , to see him so .
how did she meet her end ?
naevia was put to cart for lucania
having served purpose for batiatus &apos; ambition .
she perished in the mines ?
she gave life in passage ,
from injuries borne of mistreatment .
death a kindness then ,
to be spared such a fate .
kindness only to the one taken .
the man yet stands mute .
this is what you would offer me to gain favor ?
a statue that bleeds ?
oenomaus believes himself a man of honor .
pain alone will not move him to betray his brothers .
and i know the man well .
given over to my hands--
oh do not think i &apos;ve forgotten
what your hands are capable of , slave .
or how they aided batiatus
in tethering me to this house .
i but did as my dominus commanded ,
absent thought of refusal .
as i would faithfully serve you now ,
in seeing spartacus brought to his end .
you speak of loyalties .
yet the mark of batiatus brings allegiance to question .
a blight upon flesh .
forever mocking more noble intentions .
prove them .
and live to see if you are of further use .
your will .
my hands .
you must be patient .
the gods would not deliver oenomaus ,
only to mock us with his silence .
the sum of my doubt does not lie with the gods alone .
it &apos;s equally shared with their messenger .
ah . here is our man .
courteous to finally acknowledge our presence .
apologies . i was unaware of your arrival .
the fault is mine .
between happy reunion with father
and plying varinius for news of rome ...
is this the lanista &apos;s wife ?
the one they whisper of in the streets ?
lucretia .
to find you alive .
it &apos;s a blessing from olympus .
i am but its humble instrument .
you are overly modest .
to have survived such horrors ...
jupiter himself must have taken note of your worth .
varinius comes to present games .
games ?
two weeks of blood and sport !
to move the city from heavy thought of spartacus , yet untamed .
it shall be glorious spectacle ...
made more so by your men presented in opening celebration .
the sight of them coupled with lucretia in the pulvinus
shall help calm the citizenry .
an honor , i would happily oblige ,
were they not otherwise occupied in the south .
do they draw any closer to their goal ?
or does spartacus yet elude them ,
as i heard he did in the market ?
perhaps seppius &apos; men could march in your games .
it &apos;s well known you hold considerable sway with them .
seppius &apos; men do not carry the seal of rome , as your men do .
show good varinius to wine ,
and enticing view of the city below .
i would voice no argument .
come then .
i shall see you properly attended .
varinius is admired within the senate .
a thing to be carefully considered
before words fly from errant fucking tongue .
do i not stand his equal ?
in title only .
they think you an incompetent child ,
unable to wipe clean his own shit .
so a show of respect towards a fellow praetor
would be wise step towards quieting doubt . hmm ?
not only among the senate .
capua , to the north .
our current position , here .
to the east , vesuvius .
strong position to make camp .
within striking distance of pompeii to the south .
or neapolis to the northwest .
prison ships often empty at its ports .
vomiting men to be sold into slavery .
as my brother and i were , a lifetime ago .
i was carried across the adriatic ,
to the eastern seaboard .
i know little of neapolis .
there are fighting men , brought to its shores ?
captured in foreign wars .
already enemies of rome ,
easily recruited to our cause .
a reasonable course , well thought .
i shall break words with crixus .
towards what end ?
he stands for the gauls .
then he is waist deep in shit .
they are half our number , and much needed
in any attempt on neapolis .
the man himself is in need of distraction from wounded soul .
how did you survive ?
after your woman was taken from you forever ?
the man that i was did not .
i am but bones and flesh ,
void of beating heart .
we will see empty chest filled .
with the blood of romans .
an ocean of it would not wash away what i have done .
what you have done ?
i pursued naevia &apos;s affections ,
regardless of concern towards discovery .
of what lucretia would do if ...
betrayal were known .
naevia is gone from this world
because of my selfish desires .
we do not choose love .
it claims each man as it will .
and it grips until there is nothing left .
an empty hand can yet become a fist .
how many more remain shackled in servitude , as naevia was ?
without hope of love or gentle touch ?
together we can strike chain from neck--
on this subject i have heard your thoughts .
leave me to my own .
she was a radiant spirit .
yet she died a slave .
a fate shared by my wife .
i would not see more like them fall .
because men who could make difference stood idle .
a sword in his chest would be a blow less felt .
we have all made sacrifices .
crixus now makes his .
i would speak with him ...
your words would only cause greater suffering .
if he knew the truth ...
i would not have you and countless others fall in vain attempt .
come .
there is much planning yet needed towards neapolis .
oh , that vacant gaze .
i &apos;ve witnessed it before .
when you were upon your knees in the pits , awaiting death .
or were you longing for it ?
is that why you sought out a place
void of precious honor ?
a thought drags the mighty oenomaus
into the depths of the underworld ?
your betrayal of the house that saved you
from such torment there ?
a brotherhood turning your instruction as doctore
to treachery or murder ?
or that ashur escaped your attempt to rob him of life ?
a thing of low importance .
let us set past behind us ,
and turn eye towards less quarrelsome future .
ah , no no !
you must ask for it .
you must break silence and speak .
you thirst for water ?
for the release of death ?
free your tongue , and see desires quenched .
tell me where spartacus and his shits are to be found .
they have spat on everything you &apos;ve held true .
you owe them nothing .
speak , you fucking cunt !
very well .
remain silent .
remain living , and in pain .
day after day .
with only ashur to comfort you .
as you once comforted me upon these very sands .
you should have warned me of their arrival .
i was swept by the moment .
they stood but a short length waiting .
long enough for your father to slip noose about my neck .
all will be forgotten when you present your men .
oh to honor a jest of a man .
go .
to honor your child .
with a father that will rise within the senate .
i did not care for varinius &apos; hand upon you .
nor i.
yet his touch will never know wetter climes ...
pressing concerns pull mind from task .
task ?
you know my meaning .
must confer with marcus ,
towards the recall of my troops from the south .
we must not fall to quarrel .
vesuvius will serve purpose well .
agron speaks of fighting men to be liberated from neapolis
not far from it &apos;s banks .
agron can suck the piss from my cock !
too small a drink for a man .
fuck you !
vesuvius offers advantage .
fucking coward !
from its shadow we can strike the ports of neapolis&apos;
ships heavy with warriors captured by the romans ,
as many of us once were--
let us hear from crixus !
and what would he say ?
what words would make difference ?
the ones i have told myself ?
ones of hope ,
and promise of better days ?
throat can no longer make such empty noise .
it is choked with loss .
an agony familiar to many of us .
spartacus lost his wife .
yet his fire still burns .
agron , a brother .
yet his fire still burns .
we have all lost .
we have all seen those held as friend ,
as family ,
as lover ,
fall to the romans .
yet our fire still burns .
and together we shall ignite an inferno .
i move to vesuvius with spartacus .
you will speak .
in your final moments .
when you beg for life &apos;s end .
you will tell me where spartacus and--
you fucking cunt !
i shall tear the words from your fucking mouth !
ashur .
oenomaus must not die before prophecy is fulfilled .
then entreat the fucking heavens to pry his lips .
or you would do well to seal your own , lest tongue escape you .
i should never have returned to this house .
fortunes darken as consequence .
look to the gods for illumination .
the gods ?
was it jupiter , that found you near death ?
or venus , who stitched your mangled womb ?
did mars see you fed and clothed ?
did apollo deliver oenomaus into your hands ? no .
it was ashur !
lowest of fucking mortals !
you but service the will of the gods .
i was serving you .
and i them .
then i fear that we are both forsaken .
the man will not speak .
absent his words , your prophecy will fall to ruin .
the pious quickly to follow .
even the dead may give voice to passion .
the man stands empty of such worldly vice .
then see him filled .
with memories of the past .
there is a secret , buried within these walls .
and you will see it exhumed ,
and the corpse set to purpose ...
the hour grows late .
and our bed cold .
fall to it .
i &apos;ll be with you presently .
the maddening thing , to forever be waiting for you .
far from your side .
it &apos;s not always the safest place .
as many have learned .
i am not the past .
i stand with you now .
and would hold more value than gentle touch and satisfying your needs .
i would stand beside you ,
blade gripped in hand slick with roman blood .
i will not be helpless , as naevia was .
her life slow march towards death .
we all move towards such end .
only the length of the journey differs .
then let us greet it together .
and show not all go quietly .
you intend to spirit away the entire villa in that trunk ?
we do not know what vesuvius holds , chadara .
agron would have us well supplied .
agron , yes .
he is of a form , is he not ?
i suppose .
oh , you suppose ?
do not think i have not noticed your eyes upon him .
nor the way of late you have been huddled together
in intimate conversation .
you mistake subject of discussion .
yet not the blush upon your cheek when he is near .
you would do yourself well to pursue desire .
i would myself , if i believed he favored me .
i thought you were taken with rhaskos ?
rhaskos is a base animal .
yet one with sharp claws ,
offering protection and position .
spartacus holds agron in much high esteem .
i envy you his attentions .
we can reach vesuvius by nightfall ,
if we put the slaver wagon to use .
it would commit us to the roads .
the forest will better hide our numbers .
and slow progress .
a fair trade , to see us all to the mountain alive .
crixus .
i was not in favor of your training .
do you know the reason ?
i made attempt on spartacus .
as have i , on more than one occasion .
i did not trust you .
because you are syrian .
i have had unfortunate acquaintance with one of your people .
as did my woman , naevia .
apologies .
he caused her much pain .
yet despite this ,
she would not have held you for his actions .
such was her heart .
one i shall try to honor , in thought and deed .
there is something i must tell you ...
rome considers us nagging fly .
after neapolis , they shall know the sting --
agron !
take your man !
fucking shit !
i &apos;ll fucking kill you !
have you lost mind ?
regained heart .
naevia lives .
how do you come by this ?
the boy nasir .
the slaver told not of naevia &apos;s death ,
but of her suffering in the mines .
an equal fate--
why would you bear false tongue ,
when a life holds in the balance ?
what of our lives ?
what of our lives ?
crixus has no thought towards any but naevia .
and would have us all meet our end
in foolish attempt on the mines .
i did what needed to be done , spartacus .
you must see this .
a lie
for the greater good .
one that would never have passed lips ,
had it been your brother duro in her place .
if a single life holds no value ,
then none are of worth .
i stand with crixus .
and will see naevia from bondage .
i will not fucking die for this !
i move for vesuvius .
those that would live ,
join me .
he returns to us .
i have set vigil , throughout chill embrace of night .
concerned that in eruption i had ah--
released you to the afterlife .
it swells heart , to find you yet bound to this world .
still not a word ?
very well . save voice .
i would enjoy the sweet caress of my own .
so very much to speak of .
long years of secrets within this house ,
seeping in the very bones that support it .
place ear to any beam ,
and marvel at the whispers of the past .
it was there that i first discovered crixus ,
embraced in ill fated love with the young naevia .
there , dominus blessed me with elevation ,
upon heel of ending magistrate calavius
and cursing solonius with the deed .
further inside ...
where gannicus first took your wife ,
as entertainment for noble varus .
lies .
stone at last cracks !
in defense of a fucking whore .
were you really so blind ?
the lingering gazes they shared ?
the subtle change in your brother ?
you
know nothing of brotherhood ...
nor did gannicus .
have you never asked yourself how your wife
came to sip a tainted wine
that was meant for batiatus ?
and she was not in habit of thieving , was she ?
or partaking of drink alone ?
do you recall that night ?
gannicus , to be sold the next morning .
you , conveniently removed to town .
your wife , slipping away into gannicus &apos; cell .
one last drink .
one ...
last ...
fuck .
you &apos;re all the same .
spartacus . crixus .
the noble oenomaus .
falling to ruin for women plowed
by other men &apos;s cock .
search heart , and feel the sting of truth .
lt was a gift for titus .
how did it come to pass her lips ?
she was no thief .
your wife betrayed you .
your brother .
everyone you believed to love you .
what does a serpent know of love ?
that its bite is often fatal .
your wife fell to its venom .
as did the traitor spartacus &apos; bitch .
even the mighty gaul saw his heart wither ,
when ripe naevia was plucked forever from his grasp .
they will find her .
and one day your fucking throat .
find her ?
that is why they have moved south ...
spartacus is not the one that spurs their intent ...
crixus ?
the gaul who lost mind before you and batiatus
attacked me in his purpose then as now .
love for domina &apos;s body slave , naevia .
you pledge to discover spartacus &apos; location .
instead you return with tales of fluttering hearts ?
she was taken from this house .
i know crixus , he will not rest until--
see him to proper reward .
wait ! wait ! wait !
you would turn from the gods ,
and their guidance ?
even if this crude vessel disgorged truth ,
such knowledge provides little more
than feather upon breeze .
yet i know of calming winds ...
and where dark little feather came
to rest at tempest &apos;s end .
do not die , you simple fuck .
will you mourn me if i do ?
until i find better to fill me .
bitch .
are we to attack naked , with our cocks as weapon ?
you would fare just as well .
remove yourself from fucking sight .
go .
seek us out at vesuvius .
if you live .
pray i do not .
i accompanied my dominus to the mines once .
i may be of some aid .
well received .
fucking syrians .
the wagon is readied .
spartacus ...
save words for naevia .
when we have returned her to your arms .
i would have it so .
or perish in the attempt .
move along you fucking dogs !
do not expose brand .
we would lose advantage of being thought as common slaves .
a crack to liscus &apos; skull would add to the deception .
lower voice .
keep moving cunt .
do i give coin to sit upon ass ?
see them from the fucking wagon .
out !
hurry up !
is this the stock from ferox ?
two days past expected delivery .
two fucking days !
apologies , i -- - i do not know you .
where is ferox ?
dead .
we were set upon by spartacus and his shits .
the reason for our delay and ferox &apos;s permanent absence .
i have wished the man to grass for many years .
yet he fucks me from the afterlife .
schedule now teeters upon brink ,
with little hope of regaining balance .
yes , again , apologies--
am i to present myself now ?
yes . yes !
a special offering , to compensate your troubles ... ?
wait here .
rotten cunt serves no trade .
what misdeed sees such beauty condemned to the mines ?
form words , or find my cock reason you cannot .
i fell in love .
no danger of that here ...
i would have you form words now .
or find your cock upon the floor .
there was a woman brought here from the house of batiatus .
beautiful and young .
one a fat shit like you would have taken notice of .
speak .
i know of no such woman .
search fucking memory .
she is dark of skin .
with the mark of batiatus &apos; wife upon the back of her shoulder .
i do recall one as you just described .
does she yet draw breath ?
i believe it so .
where is she ?
assigned to dig the eastern vein .
there is a map ...
show me .
slowly .
mira is gone too long .
you there .
from where do you hail ?
sicilia .
in the tunnel that branches off . here--
i have seen you before ...
somewhere ...
the arena--
keys . quickly .
mira !
it is roman blood .
did he know of her ?
does naevia live ?
she does .
mannus . plenus .
assume their mantle .
make it known if any become aware of our presence .
into the mines . quickly .
come brother .
let us see heart restored .
go ...
move . go !
hm , you really must try this .
it &apos;s divine .
i fear stomach turned at the moment .
i do not envy you .
sickness with every sunrise .
swelling beyond reason .
though the breasts are a benefit , i suppose .
to feel a child grow within you ...
there is no greater blessing .
what of being sort of other than matron ?
enticing men until they fawn over your every word ,
aching to receive the slightest touch ?
the bonds of marriage desired result .
i suppose it would not be too horrid .
if he were handsome . and rich .
and thought of nothing but his hands upon me .
lust , as all things ,
fades with the passing of years .
sun draws high .
let us fall to our seats , and see day begin .
varinius tells that your men are to be presented .
yes .
the request would have fallen to yours ,
if they were proper soldiers .
i look forward to witnessing proper roman formation .
it should be a pleasant distraction for the people ...
while my men bring spartacus to justice .
yes .
your soldiers are to purpose ?
they are .
the crowd is yours , varinius .
good citizens of capua !
i present these games to honor the beloved sister of rome !
and to send message that her spirit
shall never be quelled
by those that seek to cause her injury .
your cheers in the coming days
shall serve as balm to wounded heart .
a wound shared by many in this great city ,
so inflicted by the treachery of spartacus
and his murderous horde .
i call now upon the sons of rome to march ,
the thunder of their every step a declaration !
that loss and grief
shall give way to triumph and joy !
where are your fucking men ?
set to purpose , as promised .
seal the road .
you !
we come on order of praetor gaius claudius glaber .
has attempt been made to breach the mines ?
none . it stands secure .
dispatch word to capua .
i would turn from fool &apos;s errand
and recommit to sweep the countryside--
seize him !
i know these men !
mannus and plenus ! gladiators ,
bearing the mark of batiatus !
spartacus is here .
which way do we go ?
they both should lead us to her .
this one the shorter path .
i would double odds toward goal .
take the longer path . move quietly .
people of capua !
noble varinius !
i offer apologies !
i do not seek to lower spirits
with absence of display ,
but instead to raise them up !
with knowledge that my soldiers
have been set to higher purpose
by the gods themselves !
at this very moment , they close on spartacus !
and by day &apos;s end , he shall once more kneel
before the glory of rome !
rome !
rome ! rome !
we must see them freed .
there are too many of them .
we would be discovered .
live .
and know i will return .
naevia ?
naevia ?
naevia ?
naevia ?
naevia !
this is where he said she would be ?
if he spoke truth .
crixus !
there is one here , with mark of her domina upon back !
naevia ... ?
naevia ?
no ...
you are safe ...
you are safe , now .
i &apos;m here ...
i &apos;m here .
crixus ?
forgive me ...
forgive me for what i have done .
spartacus ! someone comes--
go ! go !
ashur !
ashur !
move ! move !
go !
here !
wait !
there &apos;s a runoff .
it empties out on the other side of the mine .
which path do we take ?
quickly !
this way .
she leads us to our fucking death !
take breath , and gain your bearing .
a turn missed .
it will take us to the water .
here !
move !
wait !
come on ! go !
i will give them pause ,
so you may slip from grasp .
you two down there !
see naevia to safety .
crixus !
see it done , brother .
go !
spartacus !
go !
fuck you !
fuck you bastards !
kill , kill , kill ..
crixus !
crixus !
