back in the &apos; 80s , america had one clear enemy
the russians .
it was the age of the cold war .
capitalism vs. communism .
reagan vs. gorbachev .
rocky vs. that roided @-@ out monster who killed apollo creed .
but the only war i knew was the one with my brother .
and like any superpowers ,
most of our fights were about border disputes .
dude ! you &apos;re in my space .
you &apos;re in my space !
stop it .
stop fighting .
like any warring factions ,
we didn &apos;t understand each other
and had nothing in common .
barry roller @-@ skated to wham ! to impress the ladies
while i roller @-@ skated to &quot; starlight express &quot;
to impress the theatergoers .
i barely survived gym class ...
... while barry thrived as an athlete .
my dream was to be the next steven spielberg .
barry &apos;s dream was to be the next charles barkley .
swish , baby !
i collected garbage pail kids
while barry loved his baseball cards .
dude , check it out .
i just got hairy mary and oozy suzy .
oh , really ?
i got nerdy adam and punchy barry .
my most prized possession was my castle grayskull ,
and barry &apos;s was this enormous shoe .
behold , my lady .
the actual high @-@ top of basketball &apos;s greatest badass ,
sir charles barkley .
cool .
let me see -- - no !
your hand contains damaging oils .
you can admire it quietly .
at a distance .
how did you even get this thing ?
dave sirota hooked me up .
his dad &apos;s a team doctor .
all i got to do is his math homework for the rest of year .
that is a horrible deal for him .
yeah , it is .
sorry to be this dude ,
but it &apos;s just a shoe -- who cares ?
&quot; who cares ? &quot;
this is charles barkley .
the round mound of rebound .
the greatest sixer of our time .
yeah , basketball &apos;s not my sport .
well , sports aren &apos;t your sport .
even my shoe thinks you &apos;re a nerd .
huh ? what was that ?
&quot; punch your brother in the nards &quot; ?
idiot .
your shoe sounds a lot like you .
hey ! knock it off .
what did we discuss ? which barry do i like ?
sweet barry .
which barry do i hate ?
yelly , punchy barry .
yep , barry and i forever lived in a tense and bitter cold war .
we were always on guard ,
never knowing when the other would strike .
and this year , i decided to mount
an epic attack on april fools &apos; day .
my target was the one thing
he told me never to touch with my human oils .
where &apos;s my barkley shoe ?
relax .
i spilled some water on it , so i threw it in the dryer .
i told you not to touch that thing !
noooooooo !
gone .
gone forever .
fly away , little size 16 .
i &apos;m a better person for having known you .
well , who knew that high heat for an hour
would do that to rubber ?
i ... feel ... anger !
april fools &apos; !
oh , balls !
dude , it was an april fools &apos; joke .
here &apos;s the real shoe , idiot .
oh , man .
that -- yeah .
it &apos;s april already .
you got me good .
wait .
y @-@ you destroyed castle grayskull .
you owe me 100 bucks .
yeah , not gonna happen .
you should know i &apos;m unstable and would react poorly .
this is on you .
buy the power of grayskull ,
this will not stand .
thought i lost you , buddy .
it was april 1 , 1980 @-@ something ,
and my sister was spending time in her true home --
the mall .
okay , what do you want to hit next ?
benetton or sam goody ?
holy crap !
every teenage girl has a defining moment in her life .
for my sister , it was the chance
to see her rock idol jam by the food court .
tiffany ... is coming ... to our mall ?
sweet god , my life now has meaning .
yep , back before taylor swift and katy perry ,
teen pop superstars would visit your tiny town
and play a free concert in your local mall .
and the biggest star of them all was tiffany .
no last name needed .
don &apos;t you see what this means ?
i can give tiffany my demo tape ,
and she can discover me .
oh . just one problem .
you don &apos;t have a demo tape ,
and your cheap @-@ ass dad will never pay for one .
then there &apos;s only one play .
what if i told you
i could save you $ 20,000 today ?
for the first time in your life , you &apos;d have my full attention .
well , that &apos;s the price of a college education these days .
and for a mere $ 200,
i can record a music demo tape and hand it off to tiffany ,
thereby skipping college and achieving my life dream
of becoming a teen singing sensation .
dreams ? who said &quot; dreams &quot; ?
mama &apos;s here . i support you .
don &apos;t !
she wants to sing instead of going to college .
it &apos;s a nightmare .
i &apos;m not a total idiot .
i &apos;ve worked out a surefire plan that will get me to the top .
listen to our snuggle monkey .
she has a plan . it &apos;s surefire .
what &apos;s the plan ?
i take my awesome demo tape to the mall
and hand it to tiffany .
the minute she hears my soulful voice , boom !
it happens .
what happens ?
i open for her in malls across the country .
that &apos;s when i get a record deal
and meat simon le bon from duran duran
at calvin klein &apos;s lakehouse .
here &apos;s a plan -- college !
oh , you &apos;re such a grumpy pants .
just you wait . her plan will work .
yes ! i love you , mom .
the murray ? why didn &apos;t you stop me ?
stop you ? you were chewing my head off !
my baby wants to sing ? that &apos;s not a job .
but you just told her it was !
you got to go up there and tell her
she &apos;s got to go to college .
why ? you just told her she didn &apos;t !
because i &apos;m the dream pusher ,
and you &apos;re the dream smusher .
that &apos;s how this works .
this is a thing ? i &apos;m the smusher ?
yes . i push , you smush .
that &apos;s the natural order of things .
i didn &apos;t sign up for this ! you smush for once .
you know , it &apos;s exhausting always having to be the bad guy .
well , it can &apos;t be me !
i &apos;m the loving , supportive one .
you &apos;re the grumbling , grouchy one
i always hide behind .
now go !
smush , smush , smush .
hello ?
have you checked on the cards ?
what ?
have you checked on the cards ?
no .
nooo !
yes .
you drew all over my cards !
tell me this is a joke .
say &quot; april fools &apos; . &quot; say it !
no joke .
one castle grayskull for your baseball cards .
your toy &apos;s 100 bucks !
this is a million dollars !
they &apos;re $ 1 a packet .
everyone knows they triple in value every day .
this was my nest egg .
well , i guess you &apos;re gonna have to work for your money now .
never .
mark my words --
you &apos;ve waged a war you cannot win .
i &apos;m coming for you , brother .
and i &apos;m coming hard .
bring your best , bro ,
&apos;cause nothing scares adam goldberg .
oh , god . oh , god . oh , god .
he &apos;s gonna come at me .
i told him to bring his best .
why would i suggest that ?
just apologize for what you did to cal ripken .
we &apos;re long past apologies now .
this is all @-@ out war , and i &apos;m gonna win .
kiddo , i fought in a real war .
trust me -- there is no winner .
pops was right .
while i protected my toys ,
i forgot about one crucial item --
my video camera .
no ! what have you done ? !
okay , barry , you &apos;ve gone too far .
you mess with my stuff , i mess with yours .
this wasn &apos;t just stuff .
this camera meant everything .
it &apos;s like my best friend .
oh , relax .
all i did was take it apart .
here &apos;s the manual .
just -- just put it back together .
this is in chinese !
remember -- you smush , i push .
fair warning --
she &apos;s gonna get extremely upset ,
and she will throw something at you .
i apologize in advance &apos; cause i &apos;m gonna let it happen .
peanut , we need to talk .
what do you want ?
i just want you to know ...
... that i support your singing 100 % .
what ?
really ?
really .
what ?
forget about college .
gamble your life
in the dangerous and shady world of rock &apos; n &apos; roll .
for real ?
so real .
unless you mom &apos;s got something to add .
uh , not at this moment .
um , i &apos;m just letting the news wash over me
&apos;cause it &apos;s so positive .
dad , i give you my word --
when riki gold sweeps the grammys ,
you &apos;re will be the first person i thank .
riki gold ?
yeah , it &apos;s my stage name .
&apos;cause goldberg is ... you know .
you can be whoever you damn well please
because daddy believes in you and your plan .
ooh , thanks , dad !
with that , my dad became the pusher ...
forcing my mom to become the smusher .
it &apos;s a bad plan .
what ?
you know i love you ,
but you are gonna go to college and get a good job
so i don &apos;t have to stay up late at night worrying .
so , basically , you &apos;re a sham .
every time that you said you believed in me ,
it was a lie ?
of course not . it &apos;s still me .
it &apos;s your mama , snuggle monkey .
lies !
i am not your snuggle monkey .
you don &apos;t mean that .
oh , i mean it .
and you can never call me snuggly or squishy
or boopie or schmoopie ever again .
do not take schmoopie away from me .
don &apos;t you dare !
it &apos;s just i -- i don &apos;t want you to fail .
well , that makes me want to succeed even more .
i will sing for quarters on the subway .
i will sleep on lumpy couches owned by creepy disc jockeys .
sure , when times get tough ,
i may have to go cry in a bank vestibule .
and then , in the end ,
i will be bigger than tiffany and debbie gibson .
but not madonna because ... i &apos;m realistic .
since neither of my parents wanted to be the smusher ,
they turned to erica &apos;s teacher for help .
thank you so much for meeting with us on a saturday .
honestly , we really do appreciate it .
anything for erica .
in all of my years of teaching ,
i have never had a student so passionate and talented .
oh , that is so nice to hear .
and i &apos;m gonna need you to shut your mouth
and never say that again .
what ? i --
let me chime in here .
actively destroy her dreams .
thank you so much .
yeah , i &apos;m not gonna agree to that .
i &apos;m her teacher .
it is my job to inspire her , not to hold her back .
let me pipe in here , mur .
we would appreciate it
if you would shame her into quitting
using , say , scare tactics or negative reinforcement .
i don &apos;t want to tell you how to do your job .
you get it .
i really don &apos;t get it .
let me sound off here , bev .
what my wife is trying to say --
and i think we can all agree on this --
a career in music -- it &apos;s absurd .
i ... don &apos;t agree .
let me finish this off , mur .
see , millions of girls want to be stars ,
but they end up becoming waitresses or dog walkers
or music teachers .
and that is no life anyone would wish
for their little girl .
no offense .
literally couldn &apos;t be more offended .
let me take the wheel here , bev .
uh , you know what ? don &apos;t take wheel . okay ?
beverly , i cannot believe this .
i -- even though you give me hives
and i am stalked in my dreams by a blond monster ,
i have always respected
the way that you support your kids no matter what .
look . it &apos;s just --
what she wants to do , it &apos;s such a long shot .
it is if you &apos;re not there for her .
do you think that tiffany or debbie gibson
would have made it without their mothers ?
no .
they not only support their daughters ,
they manage their whole careers .
what &apos;s that , now ?
my mom realized
that she could hijack erica &apos;s career
and be both a mom and a manager .
momager .
while my mom was plotting erica &apos;s rise to stardom ,
i was planning barry &apos;s fall from grace .
i &apos;d win the cold war
by taking away the one thing he loved most --
his hot lady friend .
hi , um , lainey .
look , i know i showed my bra to dave kim for five bucks ,
but it &apos;s not , like , a thing .
no . i &apos;m afraid i &apos;m the bearer of bad news .
barry asked me to come here and terminate your relationship .
yeah , that &apos;s just not realistic , dude .
damn it .
what &apos;s going on with you two ?
he broke my video camera .
why would he do that ?
i told him i liked sweet barry .
turns out , there is no sweet barry --
only yelly , punchy barry .
i don &apos;t want to say that you could do better ,
but we &apos;re all thinking it .
you are so dead !
am i ? &apos; cause i &apos;ve never felt more alive .
lainey said she had to think about our future .
i can &apos;t have her thinking .
what if she sees me for what i am ?
well , maybe you should have thought of that
before you were who you are .
i ... feel ... anger !
what the hell ? !
where &apos;s all your nerd stuff for me to stomp on ?
put it all in storage .
now i live in a room without joy and happiness .
in ... your ... face .
i can &apos;t believe it .
you actually beat me .
april fools .
as my brother was preparing to take me down ,
tiffany was preparing to take the stage
in front of a thousand screaming teenage girls .
sorry , guys .
just got to squeeze right through you .
yeah , thanks .
oh , excuse me . hi . i &apos;m er-- i &apos;m , uh , riki gold .
and , uh , i just wanted to know
if you could give this demo tape to tiffany
and let her know that i recorded it
on my broken boom box in my bathroom ,
which isn &apos;t totally soundproof .
you can kind of hear my dad yelling in the background .
but in the end , uh , my voice totally shines through .
sure thing , kid .
oh , my god . it actually worked .
it did not work .
every other girl in town had a demo tape , too .
wow . that &apos;s a lot of tapes .
but riki gold had a plan &quot; b &quot; --
sneak up to the tour bus and get discovered
by singing directly to tiffany herself .
it was foolproof !
what the hell ? !
unfortunately , every other fool in town ...
had the exact same plan .
lainey , what are you doing here ?
duh . i want to be famous .
uh , no , wanting to be famous is my thing .
hi , girls .
scooch over . scooch .
oh , my god . why are you here ?
you parents maybe made me question
some of my life choices .
sort of my last gasp here . really need this win .
no , this is my plan .
children , behave
running just as fast as we can
holding on to one another &apos;s hands
trying to get away
into the night night !
tiffany ! tiffany !
erica &apos;s dreams of stardom
were literally driving away before her very eyes .
meanwhile , barry &apos;s dream of obliterating me
was about to become reality .
for years , he held onto a secret weapon --
something so powerful
that it could only be unleashed in a time of true war .
and that time was now .
oh , no .
oh , yes .
oh , no .
i had taken barry &apos;s girlfriend ,
and he would take my dignity by unleashing
the most embarrassing sears glamour portrait
the world had ever seen , knee @-@ high socks and all .
oh , no !
barry .
hey , buddy . what brings you by ?
how ? ! i destroyed this photo !
you mean ... this one ?
the one where mom dragged you to a studio photographer
dressed like a sad , little dandy ?
and i will post it all over the school .
no ! you can &apos;t !
that will completely destroy me !
oh , my god . pops was right !
no one wins a war .
actually , somebody does win --
whoever &apos;s got the bigger nuke .
and i &apos;ve got the adam bomb .
my mom had officially dedicated her life
to managing my sister &apos;s music career .
only problem -- erica had no idea .
what the ...
why is my awful 10th @-@ grade yearbook photo
on t @-@ shirts , buttons , and bumper stickers ?
because your momager got you your first gig .
you &apos;re playing the del ennis bowling lanes
at 10 : 00 a.m. on tuesday !
who &apos;s gonna be at the del ennis lanes
at 10 : 00 a.m. on a tuesday ?
well , del will be there and bonnie , his wife .
she rents the shoes .
and , uh , i &apos;ll be there
selling these puffy paint t @-@ shirts .
if del allows it .
he &apos;s trying to take a cut of the merch .
i &apos;m into it with him .
you don &apos;t need to know the details .
mom , maybe i should -- - no .
you were right about me .
i &apos;ve supported you your whole life .
but when it really mattered , when you really needed me ,
i panicked .
well , from now on , we &apos;re in this together --
all day , every day , on the tour bus , in hotels ,
you and your biggest fan , your mama .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m gonna momage you straight to the top .
i &apos;m gonna make sure no one ever smushes your dreams again .
you have to smush my dreams .
no , no , no . i &apos;m out of that game .
from now on , i &apos;m a pusher .
no , mom &apos;s the pusher . we can &apos;t have two pushers .
then i &apos;ll actually have to follow through on things .
wait -- i @-@ i thought this is what you wanted .
don &apos;t give it up
just &apos; cause your mom bought a bunch of puffy paint .
it &apos;s not just mom .
i went to that mall , and i realized
there &apos;s a million girls out there just like me .
and the truth is , you were right .
i just don &apos;t have a shot .
as erica was giving up on her dreams ,
barry was about to obliterate my reality .
what &apos;s going on ?
dude , it &apos;s crazy .
the berlin wall just fell .
it was one of those moments
you remember for the rest of your life --
a country divided , coming together
for a shining moment of peace .
and as barry watched it all unfold ,
he realized it was time to end the war at home .
my camera !
how did you get the money to fix it ?
i sold my barkley shoe back to dave sirota .
but what about the photo ?
you were about to dropthe adam bomb .
i saw something today that changed me .
david hasselhoff was on top of the great wall of china
in a light @-@ up jacket singing about freedom .
and it occurred to me , if &quot; knight rider &quot;
can make east and west russia find common ground ,
maybe we can , too .
while your facts are wildly off ,
your spirit is right on the money .
yeah , yeah , yeah .
sure , i &apos;m athletic and enjoy awesome stuff
while everything you know and love
is for losers who suck at life ,
but even though we &apos;re from two different worlds ,
i believe we can live in harmony .
wait . you gave me back what i love .
time to return the favor .
i &apos;m a bad boy
but a good guy
on the outside , i &apos;m tough
on the inside , i cry
i &apos;m always on the streets
rhymin &apos; and schemin&apos;
but when i think of your face , i get sensitive feelings
i mouth off to the cops
and get myself in trouble
but when you bail me out , we watch &quot; splash &quot; and cuddle
see , i &apos;m a bad boy
but a sweet guy
i get in trouble
and i don &apos;t know why
so take big tasty back
you know you can &apos;t resist
so on a humbler note , i really need this
that was ... uncomfortable .
point is , he got my camera fixed .
that &apos;s sweet .
he really is a good brother .
you &apos;re not so bad yourself .
here . for your demo .
but we agreed you were gonna talk to mom .
and i will .
but i just need you to know
that there &apos;s nobody else out there like you -- nobody .
look . i got my dream .
i got this house , i got the family , i got you .
and if this is what you really want ,
i say go for it .
to a parent , that &apos;s scary as hell .
but i can &apos;t have you live your life
thinking i held you back .
dad .
yeah ?
what you said -- that was really , um ...
thank you .
anything for you , peanut .
that &apos;s the thing about family --
you fight , you argue , you wage all @-@ out war ,
but at the end of the day , you &apos;re always on the same side .
cause in a world where everyone tries to smush you down ,
the one thing you got is your family
to push you forward .
i think we &apos;re alone now
there doesn &apos;t seem to be anyone around
that &apos;s my superstar client .
you &apos;re not gonna be the momager .
we &apos;ll see .
glad that &apos;s gone forever .
riki gold , big tasty ,
thank you for meeting me on such short notice .
meeting ? we &apos;re eating breakfast .
let me cut to the chase .
what i &apos;m looking at are two musical giants
on the precipice of greatness ,
and as your momager ...
no !
... i present &quot; the tasty gold experience . &quot;
even better , i won &apos;t even take 10 % .
you can pay me in huggies and smoochies .
no !
