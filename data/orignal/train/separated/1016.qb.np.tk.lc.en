&quot; realists don &apos;t fear the results of their study . &quot;
then why don &apos;t you find me
more favorable results , dostoyevsky ?
i hit everybody who would or could know
about the damn music box .
nothing &apos;s coming up .
keep looking .
moz .
ah . your anonymous chess opponent again .
why aren &apos;t you more curious about who &apos;s sending them ?
i like the mystery .
your girlfriend &apos;s missing .
you can &apos;t find the one thing that might free her .
one could say there &apos;s enough mystery in your life .
where &apos;s the postmark from on this one ?
there isn &apos;t one .
there isn &apos;t one ?
as in , someone hand @-@ delivered this card to your door ?
this is odd .
the other cards are blank , but the new one has a picture
of the museum of natural history on it .
a good mystery makes life interesting .
you know the chinese curse --
&quot; may you live in interesting times . &quot;
you know that &apos;s the first of two curses .
what &apos;s the other one ?
&quot; may you find what you &apos;re looking for . &quot;
what &apos;s the move ?
uh , knight to d7 .
knight to d7 .
you &apos;ve done this move before , haven &apos;t you ?
moz , i know who i &apos;m playing .
keller . this was our last game .
keller ?
looks like he &apos;s in new york .
who won ?
i don &apos;t know . we never finished playing .
high profile burglary @-@ n.y. museum of natural history
neal .
peter .
you &apos;re here early .
so are you .
whatcha doin &apos; ?
research .
heist of the american museum of natural history .
not your normal hotbed of crime and intrigue .
yeah . it &apos;s probably nothing .
hold on .
interesting list of items stolen --
antique cork duck decoys from the storeroom .
they also took wax @-@ sealed supply lists and
french soil samples that belonged to dr. john bartram .
the father of american botany .
just playing a hunch ?
oh , they already have a suspect .
they caught a guy stuffing his backpack .
manuel campos .
he &apos;s out on bail today .
maybe we should go talk to him .
we could do that .
i think it &apos;s great you &apos;ve taken an interest
in a small @-@ time museum heist .
history is important .
yes . duck decoys and french soil samples .
you don &apos;t want me looking into this . why ?
i don &apos;t want to waste your time with a hunch .
cut the crap . what &apos;s going on here ?
look , i &apos;m being honest with you , peter . i don &apos;t know yet .
all right , clearly , there &apos;s something bigger going on .
i don &apos;t believe for a minute this campos is the mastermind ,
and neither do you .
who &apos;s pulling the strings , and why do i give a damn ?
i have a theory .
look out ! look out .
manuel !
oh , my god , manuel !
that &apos;s campos .
you &apos;re gonna tell me what the hell is going on .
right .
manuel campos just died in i.c.u.
his wife &apos;s a mess , says she didn &apos;t see the driver .
nypd &apos;s out of leads .
tell me who &apos;s responsible for this .
his name is matthew keller .
he &apos;s the blue @-@ collar version of me .
keller ? he &apos;s been on our radar before .
and he always slipped off .
interpol has linked him to everything
from arms smuggling to stolen antiquities .
yeah , but they never had anything more than hearsay .
keller has never been caught .
all right , who is he ? some kind of rival of yours ?
more like an opponent .
we met at the grand casino ,
cut our teeth in monaco working the world backgammon finals .
last i heard , he pulled the stockholm airport robbery .
drove right up to a flight unloading krugerrands .
left fake bombs on the runway so no one could follow him .
you met him playing backgammon ?
it was simpler times .
if this is keller ,
i &apos;m guessing he posted campos &apos;s bail
so he could get rid of him .
all right .
what &apos;s with the museum heist - the cork and the wax ?
it was a bet keller and i made a long time ago --
counterfeit a bottle of wine owned by ben franklin .
you and your wine . that &apos;s why people are dying on the street ?
marie antoinette gave franklin a bottle of chateau du munn .
it &apos;s rumored to be in private hands ,
but it &apos;s never gone to auction .
the point is , the franklin bottle can &apos;t be counterfeited .
it &apos;s a challenge --
figure out who can pull off the impossible .
may the best man win .
i don &apos;t care about your rivalry .
if he &apos;s my killer , i want him .
let &apos;s check around ,
see if there &apos;s any chatter on this bottle .
mr. cattigan .
sir roland cattigan .
sir cattigan .
you know about this franklin bottle ?
yes . a seller will be presenting it on friday ,
and we will be adding it to weatherby &apos;s auction .
who is the seller ?
may i ask why the fbi wants to know ?
it &apos;s a forgery .
oh , that &apos;s quite impossible . the franklin bottle --
can &apos;t be faked . i &apos;ve heard .
well , my seller wishes to remain anonymous .
then you &apos;re gonna have to disappoint him .
tell me , agent , do you fashion yourself a wine aficionado ?
i like a good pinot now and then .
pinot . you &apos;ve seen &quot; sideways . &quot;
your point ?
my point is that my palate is insured by lloyd &apos;s of london
for a million euros .
my point is that you don &apos;t understand the subtleties of my business .
i think i do .
word gets out a high @-@ profile bottle like this is fake ,
you &apos;re done .
now , i don &apos;t want to shut your business down
and search your premises with a warrant .
but i will .
i don &apos;t know the seller .
but the broker for the bottle
is a woman named grace quinn .
satisfied ?
i believe i am .
what &apos;s this ?
my search warrant .
put me down for moo shu pork .
i &apos;m a bad influence .
our broker &apos;s name is grace quinn .
says here that she runs an upscale wine cellar
called bin 903 .
think we can link her to keller ?
let me talk to her .
what ?
you can &apos;t go asking around with a badge .
you &apos;ll scare him off .
i &apos;ll tell her i &apos;m representing a client
who &apos;s interested in the bottle ,
see what i can dig up .
you know where to find me .
always do .
chateau latour , mouton rothschild .
a case of petrus , 1945 .
that &apos;s a serious collection .
look , my client doesn &apos;t want his ex @-@ wife --
or the i.r.s. - to know about his holdings .
that &apos;s not uncommon . we &apos;re very discreet here .
if you &apos;d like to bring him by ,
i &apos;m hosting a private wine tasting
to celebrate weatherby &apos;s annual sale .
does that invite extend to me ?
if you bring your client , it does .
we &apos;ll be opening some rare bottles .
all right , i &apos;ll see what i can do .
my client is a very cautious man .
it &apos;ll help if i can give
him a firsthand account of the facilities .
any chance i can get a tour ?
of course .
right this way .
as you &apos;ll see , our vault is state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art .
humidity is at a constant 62 % ,
temp at 50 degrees fahrenheit .
nice .
ooh ! sorry about that .
it &apos;s okay . that &apos;s what it &apos;s here for .
we change the code every day .
good .
i notice you don &apos;t have surveillance cameras .
we consider our clients &apos; anonymity to be top priority .
i assume it &apos;s something
a cautious man like your client would appreciate .
well , you assume right , grace .
shall we ?
chateau du munn , post @-@ french revolution .
nice .
who &apos;s the collector ?
i can &apos;t say .
wouldn &apos;t happen to be the same individual
auctioning the franklin bottle on friday ?
i can &apos;t comment on that bottle .
but , uh , no .
it &apos;s not the same individual .
seems more his speed .
that i can neither confirm nor deny .
let &apos;s be honest with each other .
i know you &apos;re brokering the sale .
you shouldn &apos;t .
if i didn &apos;t , i wouldn &apos;t be very good at my job , ms . quinn .
your client must be well @-@ connected .
that i can neither confirm nor deny .
i &apos;d love to meet the seller of the bottle sometime .
he &apos;s been here recently , hasn &apos;t he ?
what makes you say that ?
a man of his taste , i &apos;m sure he has an appreciation for history .
as do i.
may i ?
be my guest .
&quot; king &apos;s crown --
&quot; tavern once frequented by george washington ,
now long buried under water street . &quot;
fascinating .
i get the message .
what &apos;s up , peter ?
how did your chat go with ms . quinn ?
i didn &apos;t find anything on keller .
you think he finished the forgery ?
maybe . look , i don &apos;t know .
did you find anything on your end ?
i might know why he &apos;s running this scam ,
and it &apos;s got nothing to do with you .
am i supposed to feel relieved ?
i would be . i contacted interpol .
their sources say he &apos;s got a big bull &apos;s @-@ eye on his back .
yeah ?
yeah .
that stockholm heist he pulled ?
it was bankrolled with russian mob money .
seems the comrades got a little upset
when he skipped europe without giving them their cut .
if they catch him now , they &apos;ll kill him .
unless he promised the russians their money back and then some .
he &apos;s gonna pay off his debt with the money from the bottle .
i want you here first thing in the morning .
i want to find keller before they do .
me too .
matthew keller .
see you got my postcards .
thanks for keeping in touch .
we never did get to finish our game .
aren &apos;t you curious to see who wins ?
not anymore .
manuel campos died today .
i &apos;m sorry -- who ? - your thief .
he had a wife .
still afraid to get dirty , huh , caffrey ?
violence requires no imagination .
anyone can use a gun ...
or a car .
that &apos;s why you &apos;ll always be second @-@ rate --
you &apos;re too weak to do what &apos;s necessary to get what you want .
including kate , from what i heard .
nice try .
but you officially lost that one .
you were in prison for what , four years ?
missed a lot of valentine &apos;s days .
i forgot how endearing it was when she talks in her sleep .
i should &apos;ve warned you , but we &apos;re , uh ...
at the edge of your leash here .
might want to take it easy .
imagine how i felt
when i discovered that you , of all people ,
were working for the feds .
i step forward , and a dozen fbi agents
will be here in minutes .
that right ? be my guest .
only one they &apos;d have sufficient cause to arrest is you .
really ?
yeah .
trespassing ? ugh . come on , neal .
you &apos;re clutching at straws here .
they got all capone on tax evasion .
you flatter me with the comparison .
what do you want ?
i want to play the game .
the franklin bottle ?
yeah . i want to know who &apos;s the best .
you already submitted yours for the auction .
guess you won .
you never could follow through , caffrey .
that &apos;s why kate went looking for something else .
i &apos;ll give you the first piece .
now let &apos;s play the game .
you got 10 days .
what is this ?
a challenge .
okay , where &apos;d you get it ?
keller . he wants a face @-@ off .
gave me the first piece
to forge my own franklin bottle .
awfully sporting of him .
well , not exactly .
gave himself a big head start .
why do i get the feeling this isn &apos;t about the bottle ?
moz --
it &apos;s about kate .
it always was between you and keller .
like he ever had a chance .
it doesn &apos;t matter what it was about . keller killed a man .
oh , sure , sure . now you &apos;re the noble warrior .
okay , what &apos;s the plan ?
i &apos;m gonna beat him . he gave me the bottle .
now we need to fill it , cork it ,
seal it , and label it .
you like scavenger hunts ?
i &apos;ve been known to uncover an easter egg or two in my time .
what &apos;s on the list ?
you saw keller .
i did .
damn it neal . i could &apos;ve done this right .
i could &apos;ve taken him down --
on what , exactly ?
he &apos;s completely clean . that &apos;s how he works .
doesn &apos;t take away the fact
that you should &apos;ve cleared it with me first .
you &apos;re right . i should &apos;ve .
you should &apos;ve .
weatherby &apos;s received keller &apos;s bottle this morning .
wow . it &apos;s good .
yeah . it &apos;s also our only piece of evidence
linking keller to campos &apos;s murder ,
and it &apos;s locked in a vault .
might as well be at the bottom of the atlantic ocean ,
considering how circumstantial all of this is .
i &apos;m assuming a takeout menu won &apos;t fly this time ?
nope .
unless we can convince them it &apos;s a fake .
that cattigan guy won &apos;t stop the auction
just because we claim it &apos;s a fake .
and we need proof that it is .
we can submit a franklin bottle of our own .
there &apos;s only one bottle in existence , right ?
if i turn in a fake that &apos;s just as good as keller &apos;s ,
they &apos;ll have to test them both .
what kind of test ?
standard stuff -
carbon date the cork ,
run a molecular test on the wax ,
spectroscopic refraction on the glass .
stuff they got from the museum heist .
right .
his bottle will pass those , and so will mine .
that &apos;ll force the auction house to run a cesium test .
they don &apos;t like to run them because they &apos;re so expensive ,
but it &apos;s a way to determine the age
of the wine inside the bottle without opening it .
cesium 137 doesn &apos;t exist in nature .
after they detonated the first atomic bomb ,
it spread around the world .
anything that was bottled before 1945 --
like the real franklin bottle --
right -- is cesium free .
if keller &apos;s bottle has it , it &apos;s a fake .
why can &apos;t i just get some 100 @-@ year @-@ old wine and fill it up ?
there &apos;s the rub .
they &apos;d know you just added it
because the oxygen content would be too high ,
and that &apos;s why it can &apos;t be forged .
and you think you can beat this cesium test ?
no . nobody can . it &apos;s impossible .
and that &apos;s the beauty of it .
you force the test . you both fail .
it proves that keller &apos;s bottle &apos;s a counterfeit .
we got him on fraud .
it &apos;s not murder , but it &apos;s a start .
how you gonna put the bottle together ?
already got a man on it .
how &apos;s it coming ?
moz .
overreact much ?
what are you gonna do with tweezers ?
the shinobi ninja can fashion a weapon out of anything .
you &apos;re not a ninja .
that &apos;s exactly what i want you to believe .
how &apos;s the bottle coming ?
oh , i , uh , paid off a guard at that maritime exhibit
for french cork made before the industrial revolution .
we got our newspaper .
what is this -- a new york gazette from 1785 ?
they use it for insulation in the walls
at the colonial alehouse .
that &apos;s perfect .
there &apos;s only one egg missing from our basket .
wax .
preferably 18th @-@ century beeswax
from the chateau du munn vineyard .
grace -- keller &apos;s broker --
has a few chateau du munn in her vault .
how much wax do we need ?
not much .
i can make it work with just a few shavings .
how &apos;s the security there ?
good .
keypad with a rotating code ,
biometric scanner plate --
with pulse monitor .
ohh . that makes it trickier .
so , how do you get in ?
have her open the door .
for you ?
no .
for my client -- carlton leed .
who &apos;s that ?
no .
that &apos;s your favorite word , isn &apos;t it ?
it &apos;s a classic -- &quot; nope , &quot;
&quot; never , &quot; &quot; forget about it . &quot;
what makes you think i would break into any place with you
and steal anything ?
no , we are not breaking in . you &apos;ll be shown around .
and we &apos;re not stealing anything ...
... of value .
all i need are some wax shavings .
it &apos;s like taking a lock of hair from the floor of a barbershop .
theft is theft .
i &apos;m a c.i. , not an agent .
i don &apos;t have the same restrictions .
we can call this one a gray area .
nada .
come on .
you can get all dressed up , hobnob with pretty people ,
drink a fine glass of port .
from everything you know about me ,
what makes you think i &apos;d enjoy any of what you just said ?
because this is about catching a killer .
a wax shaving for a murderer .
this won &apos;t affect the value of anything in grace &apos;s collection ?
nope . no . nada .
and for the record , i hate port .
it &apos;s syrupy .
there will be other options .
i still say this tie is ridiculous .
it &apos;s italian . and it looks good .
well , i feel like i should be flossing my teeth with it ,
not wearing it around my neck .
all right ,
the sooner we can get grace to show us the cellar ,
the sooner you can get back to your favorite pair of sweatpants .
now , i know wine isn &apos;t your thing --
it &apos;s a tasting , neal .
you nose a bottle , take a sip ,
and say something pretentious
like , &quot; rich , with nice body . &quot;
speaking of ...
you made it . you must be mr. leed .
please , call me carlton .
grace quinn .
i hear you &apos;re a man of discriminating taste .
i hope we find something to your liking today .
love your tie .
she loves the tie .
yeah .
we &apos;ll be starting with a 1985 chateau petrus pomerol .
great year . you &apos;re not holding back .
what do you think ?
i &apos;d say it &apos;s , uh , woodsy ,
with a medium body and a hint of --
the lady asked what i thought .
the use of wood is evident in its broadness of flavors .
great persistence in the mouth .
it opens up well in the glass .
i would agree .
i understand you have a more ...
substantial private collection ?
would you care to see the vault ?
your friend &apos;s not coming ?
uh , no , i don &apos;t need a babysitter .
please , allow me .
and you &apos;re a gentleman , too .
as you can see , our security system is state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art .
really ?
would you like to try something else ?
i &apos;d love some . thank you .
there you are .
chateau dumunn , post @-@ french revolution .
ms. quinn ,
i have a question about the chateau petrus .
sorry to interrupt .
mm . please . don &apos;t i know you ?
i don &apos;t think so .
i guess you just have one of them faces , huh ?
mind filling this up for me ?
of course .
thank you .
now i got it .
yeah , i saw you earlier .
you , uh , came in with your friend .
where &apos;d he get off to , anyway ?
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;m not his keeper .
you &apos;re not , huh ?
see , i think you are .
and now i &apos;m wondering what would happen
if i ask the security guard to check the vault ...
right now .
i mean , i &apos;m wondering what that does to a lawman &apos;s career ,
when his errand boy gets caught
breaking into somebody &apos;s private property ?
and i &apos;m having a hard time figuring out
why i don &apos;t book you for murder one ... right now .
is that right ?
how about i get grace to lock this vault down ?
what are the cops gonna find when they look inside ?
cellar full of dusty , overpriced wine .
you know what ?
i &apos;m glad you brought in the fbi , caffrey .
makes it exciting , right ?
be that much richer when i beat you .
oh , i forgot to tell you - he &apos;s a big fan of himself .
i noticed that .
by the way ,
i heard that somebody mowed down a citizen
right in front of an fbi agent ?
what a shame .
that &apos;s got to be embarrassing for the bureau , right ?
good luck with that investigation .
i spent five minutes with the guy .
i want to punch him right in the face .
imagine how i feel .
you &apos;ll feel better when we take him down .
this can &apos;t be good .
why does everyone say that
when i walk into their office ?
so , you have good news ?
no .
i contacted the auction house .
they &apos;re closed to new entries .
closed ? we can &apos;t submit our bottle ?
sorry , peter .
now , quit the fool &apos;s errands and catch this guy .
you &apos;ve outdone yourself , moz .
flatterer . what &apos;s next ?
i set up the vacuum pumps ...
and transfer the wine .
expecting someone ?
keller , maybe ?
june ?
no .
peter . hey . what are you doing here ?
got some bad news .
the auction house is closed to new entries .
i appreciate your a @-@ team run here , guys ,
but i can &apos;t let you take your bottle to weatherby &apos;s .
it &apos;s hughes . he pulled the plug .
if we don &apos;t ,
they won &apos;t run the cesium test .
keller will get away with a half @-@ million dollars
and probably murder .
what if he wins ?
or worse , what if you win ?
this guy will stop at nothing .
that &apos;s why we have to stop him .
no offense , but your team ... hasn &apos;t .
you &apos;re right .
keep going . let &apos;s take him down .
finish ?
lactose .
see you in the morning . i &apos;ll call jones
and figure out a way to get this bottle into the auction .
let &apos;s go , haversham .
morning , peter .
morning .
i got nothing on the auction house .
weatherby &apos;s looks pretty damn legit .
damn . we need some kind of leverage .
so cattigan will let our bottle in .
keller really got to you , huh ?
yeah , he &apos;s a piece of work .
he and neal may be rivals ,
but he &apos;s the anti @-@ caffrey ,
the bizarro neal .
what , you got something ?
yeah , they had lousy weather in france this summer --
couple of blazing @-@ hot months .
the grape harvest came up short .
that &apos;s good ?
yeah .
1947 was not a good year .
$ 40,000 .
$ 45,000 . thank you very much .
$ 50,000 . thank you , sir .
$ 50,000 with the gentleman on my right . $ 50,000 .
$ 55,000 .
$ 55,000 with the lady in the back .
$ 55,000 .
$ 55,000 .
$ 60,000 . thank you , sir .
$ 60,000 .
i see european nobles and a handful of hedge @-@ fund managers ,
but no sign of your buddy keller .
it &apos;s hard to arrest him on fraud if he doesn &apos;t show up .
keller wouldn &apos;t miss the chance
to see my face when this goes down .
he must be watching .
so , he could be anywhere .
no , he &apos;ll be nearby ,
just in case anything goes wrong .
doesn &apos;t help us much .
you think we can get this into the auction ?
i have a move up my sleeve .
i &apos;m sorry , i can &apos;t submit your bottle
since clearly it has to be counterfeit .
one of them has to be .
how do you know it &apos;s not yours ?
we have reason to believe this is the real bottle .
where did you get it ?
we &apos;re not at liberty to say .
i won &apos;t admit it to the auction .
you sure about that ?
last year , you sold six magnums
of chateau lafleur , 1947,
at about $ 50,000 a bottle .
that &apos;s public record .
i talked to the vineyard .
they only produced five magnums that year .
you don &apos;t want people knowing you got scammed , do you ?
bad for business .
i guess you &apos;ll have to test them both to find out .
i can &apos;t . it will take at least three hours . the auction --
can wait three hours .
my client welcomes the challenge .
figured he might .
oh , while we wait , why don &apos;t you give me the i.p. addresses
of everyone watching on your internet feed ?
thanks .
hey , boss . how &apos;s it going ?
they &apos;re running the test now .
congrats .
yeah , not celebrating yet .
how &apos;s it going in there ?
we &apos;re tracing those i.p.s.
any hits ?
three locations -- the carlyle , the peninsula ,
and a parking garage .
who &apos;d be watching from a parking garage ?
somebody who wants to be on the move .
send units to the hotels ,
but put the bulk of our guys on the parking garage .
they &apos;re about to announce the results of the test .
we &apos;re about to move on keller .
sounds like &quot; checkmate &quot; to me .
thank you again for your patience .
we apologize for the delay , but as some of you are aware ,
we have had to conduct a cesium test
to verify the authenticity
of the two bottles we have been presented with .
the test shows that one of the bottles is a forgery .
&quot; one of the bottles &quot; ?
the other , represented by miss grace quinn ,
is authentic .
thank you for your patience .
the bidding will commence shortly .
you said it was impossible to fake .
it is impossible .
unless he had the ...
... real bottle all along .
if keller had the real bottle ,
why would he go through all this ?
why pretend to have a fake ?
he wanted to drive up the price . damn ! that &apos;s it .
surround the bottle with controversy .
now everyone in here is dying to get their hands on it .
it &apos;ll go for double , even triple the price now .
which gives him more than enough money
to pay off his debt to the russians .
and he used me to do it .
this was his plan the whole time . he is good .
we have to arrest him now .
as soon as this auction ends , he &apos;s gone .
what am i gonna arrest him on ?
i mean , we have nothing on him now .
trespassing .
what ?
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m gonna ask you this ,
but have you seen him trespass ?
i have , actually , at a construction site .
it had a &quot; no trespassing &quot; sign and everything .
all right , we may not be able to hold him for long ,
but finding keller &apos;s gonna take a bit .
all right , well , i &apos;ll stall until you can get him .
nothing ...
illegal , i know .
hey , moz , it &apos;s me .
is the auction over ?
no . i just stepped outside .
so , how &apos;s it going ?
not good .
keller &apos;s bottle is real .
he has the real bottle ?
you &apos;re kidding me .
nope .
then why --
to drive the price up .
brilliant . and we took the bait .
did they test both bottles ?
yep .
how did our bottle do ?
passed every test except the cesium .
you did great , moz . now , focus . i need your help .
we can still nail this guy .
on what ?
i &apos;ll tell you later . we got to find him first .
remember how i told you keller had a debt to the russians ?
of course . i have perfect recall .
well , i &apos;m trying to stall the bidding .
keller &apos;s gonna want to pay these guys off as soon as possible .
which must mean that they &apos;re in town somewhere .
exactly .
i &apos;ll ask around .
yeah , well , do it fast .
if you find anything , meet me at weatherby &apos;s .
i &apos;ll leave a pass for you at the front .
anything ?
signal &apos;s coming
from the northwest corner of the garage .
we &apos;ve sealed off every entrance and exit .
all right , good .
we &apos;re doing a floor @-@ by @-@ floor search , people , starting now .
i want everyone prepared . this guy could be armed .
nobody gets out .
i must say , it appears this spot of intrigue
has whetted appetites .
so , without further ado ,
we &apos;ll open the bidding at $ 100,000 .
what did you find out ?
i did follow @-@ up on your suit &apos;s intel .
turns out , the russians are indeed after keller .
they want their money now .
and sergei himself is in town .
he wants personal assurance from keller
that he &apos;s gonna get paid the moment this auction is done .
i got an idea .
anything ?
no , nothing yet .
clear .
clear over here .
damn it . all right , next floor . let &apos;s move .
$ 375,000 , ladies and gentlemen .
$ 375,000 from the gentleman on my right .
$ 400,000 on the phone .
do i hear $ 425,000 ?
no one inside .
look at this .
son of a bitch must have seen us coming .
he &apos;s not here .
security cameras have him fleeing the scene .
he hot @-@ wired another car
two minutes before we cordoned off the building .
so , you have no idea where he is ?
we &apos;re pulling surveillance on him now with traffic cams .
didn &apos;t have time to take any of his things with him .
his things ?
yeah , he had a laptop he &apos;d been monitoring the auction from .
he &apos;s not watching the auction anymore ?
probably not .
too concerned with getting the hell out of here .
all right , find out where he &apos;s headed .
the bidding is now $ 800,000
to the gentleman on my right .
this is a lousy idea .
do it , moz .
these people don &apos;t take i.o.u.s.
fair warning - i can sell for $ 800,000 .
do it !
$ 1 million !
thank you , sir .
$ 1 million ...
and sold !
what did you get us into ?
peter , where are you ?
still in the garage .
what happened ?
i won the bid .
what ? !
don &apos;t worry . i got a plan .
you usually do .
what &apos;s the status on keller ?
headquarters is monitoring his movement in real time
from traffic cams .
looks like he &apos;s headed south on park .
south on park . thanks .
i know where keller &apos;s going .
bravo , keller . seriously .
wow . so , you came by to see me off , huh , caffrey ?
who knew you were such a gracious loser ?
i have to admit ,
using the real ben franklin bottle --
did not see that coming .
stroke of genius , really .
thanks . actually means a lot coming from you .
only wish kate was around to see it .
i mean , we both know , she always loved a winner , right ?
who knows ?
maybe i &apos;ll look her up , see if she still does .
so , i &apos;m curious .
how &apos;d you find me ?
checked sergei &apos;s travel plans .
see he does it in style . hmm .
i also hear he doesn &apos;t take it lightly
when someone owes him money .
owed .
as in past tense .
hey , see , our little go @-@ round with the bottle
cleared my debts .
in fact , i just got a text from my broker --
bottle went for seven figures .
wow ! wow , congratulations .
thank you , thank you . yeah , yeah .
so , it was a two @-@ birds , one @-@ stone thing ?
humiliate me , turn a hefty profit while you &apos;re at it ?
see ? now you &apos;re catching on , neal .
listen , i &apos;d love to chat , buddy ,
but unless you got anything else ,
i should get going , all right ?
be good .
i haven &apos;t made my offer yet .
this should be good .
i &apos;d like to offer you the opportunity
to make a full confession for your crimes .
the robbery of the natural history museum ,
the murder of manuel campos ,
anything else you want to add in .
you know what ? i was wrong .
this isn &apos;t good . this is sad , man .
this is a moment i &apos;ll cherish --
seeing you at your most desperate .
the winner of the franklin bottle--
it wouldn &apos;t happen to be bidder number 57 , would it ?
why ?
now , this is just awkward ,
but i don &apos;t have a million dollars .
luckily , the auction house said they &apos;d give me a week
to put the money together .
a week , huh ?
know what ? a week &apos;s not that long . i can buy that .
did you tell him i &apos;m launching
a full @-@ blown federal investigation on the bottle ?
oh , yeah . yeah . there &apos;s that , too .
how long can a federal investigation go on for ?
not sure . years .
oh , years . wow .
you son of a bitch .
how patient are sergei and your russian friends ?
you could take a helicopter ride and find out .
or you can come with us . your choice .
well played .
good game , keller .
game ain &apos;t over .
help this gentleman into the car .
looks that way to me .
yeah ?
i mean , you were locked up , broke out .
maybe it &apos;s my turn to accept the challenge .
best two out of three .
i &apos;ll see you around , caffrey .
i &apos;m counting the days .
guess sergei &apos;s going home empty @-@ handed .
did i miss keller ?
damn . i wanted to see him do the perp walk .
sorry .
good news is he won &apos;t be bothering us for a while .
how long is &quot; a while &quot; ?
maybe long enough to finish our chess game .
think they have a prison that can hold him ?
i don &apos;t know .
okay , so , what &apos;s the bad news ?
you won &apos;t be drinking a million @-@ dollar bottle of wine tonight .
i &apos;ll live .
you were right .
i could use one less mystery in my life .
oh , i rescind that comment .
there &apos;s suddenly been a lot of chatter about the music box .
you need to talk to alex .
she won &apos;t tell me anything while i work for the fbi .
