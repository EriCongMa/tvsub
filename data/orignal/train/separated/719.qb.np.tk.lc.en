i know about you and ben .
i have one certainty in my life .
and that is how i feel about you .
i can &apos;t , jack . i &apos;m sorry .
if you &apos;re gonna keep coming at me ,
you &apos;re gonna have to be a hell of a lot smarter .
i will find your weak spot .
are you looking for my ex @-@ wife ?
i found her .
and if you don &apos;t do as i ask ,
i could let another person know who wants to find her
for a completely different reason .
the remainder of edward grayson &apos;s estate
is being left to his wife .
so sorry i &apos;m late .
teddy and i were married four months ago .
this will is fraudulent .
what &apos;s your plan for that ketch ?
how about you buy me a drink ...
and it &apos;s yours ?
your campaign is sinking .
i always find a way to come out on top .
i understand how it feels
to be screwed out of an inheritance .
i need a lawyer ,
not an opportunist .
well , it &apos;s a good thing for you that i &apos;m both .
what the hell was that in there ?
one sour look from the judge , and you flee ? !
you told me that you were a pit bull ,
but you neglected to mention that you &apos;ve been neutered .
victoria , he said if all we had
were lies and conjecture , there &apos;d be sanctions .
which is why i &apos;ve not only lost my rightful inheritance ,
but all respect for you .
i still have a career to consider .
oh , not in this part of the country you don &apos;t .
go home , mr. ellis .
there is nothing left for you here ...
no campaign , no career ,
not even that little sister of yours
will give you the time of day .
where &apos;s your toy attorney running off to ?
you may have lost in there ...
and remarkably quickly , i might add ...
but no hard feelings .
i was hoping to invite you to my shindig this weekend .
you &apos;re throwing the annual fourth of july party ?
it was a last @-@ minute decision ,
and the date was open so ...
oh , this must be hard for you ,
considering this party &apos;s always been a grayson tradition .
well , it still is ,
considering that you &apos;ll be using
stolen grayson money to throw it .
or maybe you found another suitor to swindle .
should i check the obituaries ?
victoria , look ,
you gave it your best shot in court .
it &apos;s over .
you clearly don &apos;t know me .
which is exactly why i want you to come tomorrow .
do you like her ?
depends on what &quot; her &quot; you &apos;re referring to .
i have to hear through the grapevine
that not only are you seeing a grayson ,
but you &apos;re accepting gifts from her , too ?
what the hell , dad ?
no , i @-@ i didn &apos;t say anything
&apos;cause there &apos;s not really much to say .
natalie and i had drinks a couple of times ...
dinner tonight , and that &apos;s about it .
if it helps you at all , uh , she despises victoria .
still a grayson .
she &apos;s a grayson , but only in name .
hey , trust me .
i &apos;ve been through 20 years of hell .
all i want &apos;s a quiet life
where i drift around ,
catch up with my ...
very protective daughter .
and that &apos;s what i want , too ,
but , dad , we have to look out for each other .
okay .
from here on out , no secrets .
including who i &apos;m dating and who you are .
david , that alternator is in worse shape than we thought .
oh , yeah , well , of course it is . i &apos;ll see to it .
all right , just don &apos;t remove it .
i think it &apos;s holding the hull together .
i like the scruff .
one of the perks of early retirement ?
my dad mention this to you ?
let me guess ... you don &apos;t approve .
he barely knows her .
i thought that &apos;s what dating was for ,
to get to know someone .
isn &apos;t that why you &apos;re with ben ?
god , jack ,
i don &apos;t want things to be like this between us .
how should they be , emily ?
jack !
jack .
he didn &apos;t listen to a word i said .
better get down there .
need your help !
hey , jack .
it &apos;s good to see you back on a boat .
oh , my god ! yes !
oh , don &apos;t stop .
this is amazing , nolan !
easy , tiger ...
save some of that roar
for when they break out the hot stones .
so this is what it &apos;s like to be married .
oh , i booked us a couples &apos; cooking class .
oh , fun !
i remember when i was little
and our maid taught lyman and i
how to make bread puddin &apos; with bourbon sauce .
lyman always had to be in charge of the bourbon .
mm , speaking of the devil &apos;s advocate ,
i heard something about him working for victoria ?
yeah .
lyman &apos;s always been drawn to strong women .
sounds more like a moth drawn to a money flame .
oh , you know ...
lyman has some good in him .
he just keeps it hidden away
like a squirrel with his acorns .
mm , i get it .
i &apos;ve ... got a sister from another mister in ems .
and ...
she &apos;s done all sorts of crazy .
and i still love her .
even if you don &apos;t love her choice in beaus these days ?
what ? you thought you were hiding that ?
what &apos;s wrong with ben ?
nothing .
it &apos;s just ... when emily moved on ,
i thought she &apos;d be moving towards jack .
i think he did , too .
god , jack must be broken up .
yeah , i don &apos;t know .
i mean , i saw him bartending at mcginty &apos;s the other night ,
and he was all smiles .
mcginty &apos;s ?
when i offered him a job at the club ,
he turned me down flat .
i thought that was because he was ...
reeling from heartbreak ? oh , honey .
i know how much you hate being wrong ,
but trust your friends .
if emily likes the way this &quot; big ben &quot; turns her clock ...
i don &apos;t know ... he may be worth her time .
you don &apos;t believe i &apos;ve located her ?
yeah , well , all i &apos;ve seen so far is a picture of my ex @-@ wife
that could have been photoshopped from 10 years ago .
believe me now ?
april is an innocent in your war with emily .
yes , but you are not .
let me explain something about your new girlfriend --
wherever she goes , she leaves pain in her wake ,
and i know you don &apos;t want april to fall victim to that ,
or you wouldn &apos;t be here .
so , did you bring what i asked for ?
why go to these lengths when anyone who cares
already knows that emily thorne is amanda clarke ?
oh , you mean the friends
who perpetuate her lies and cover @-@ ups ?
the world out there likes nothing more
than to destroy devils who pretend to be righteous angels .
when they hear the whole story , she will be crucified .
well done , officer hunter .
margaux fell right into our trap .
ben &apos;s glasses got the footage .
bottle of red , no visible label .
bottle of white -- try that .
where the hell is this diner ?
one bottle of pinot gris enhanced for your benefit .
wow . that &apos;s incredible .
try not to drool on the hologram .
you get lost ?
yeah , well , feeding your lies to margaux
took a little bit longer than expected .
mm , betrayal ...
you always got to give yourself an extra 15 minutes .
she didn &apos;t suspect a thing .
your &quot; get smart &quot; shades .
they &apos;re called nolbans .
that diner carries some unusual bottles of wine .
yeah . wow , this one &apos;s from the keuka wine trail .
most of these small wineries
don &apos;t distribute outside the region ,
so i just cross @-@ reference the vineyard with local diners
that have a beer @-@ and @-@ wine license .
voila -- the ex @-@ wife formerly known as april .
look , margaux &apos;s no amateur .
we have 10 , maybe 12 hours before she figures out
the birth certificate &apos;s a fake .
yeah , and when she does ,
she tells this guy where april is .
wes perkins .
this is the chump she left you for ?
well , to be clear , she didn &apos;t leave me for him .
she left me and then hooked up with him a year later .
but by the time she learned
he had done time for aggravated assault ,
she was too afraid to get out , so she ran .
which is exactly why we need to get to her first .
look , i still think i should come with you .
no . no , i need to do this on my own .
since when do you take no for an answer ?
when it &apos;s not my mission , nolan .
when have we ever benefited
by letting someone else handle things , hmm ?
and ... if ben has secrets ,
isn &apos;t it better to know what they are sooner
as opposed to when it &apos;s too late ?
why would natalie waters throw such an extravagant event ?
to make my life hell
and to announce her arrival as a one @-@ percenter .
well , she already did the former ,
and the latter seems unnecessary ,
considering her recent acquisition .
she purchased an estate in malibu ,
马里布城
which may work in your favor .
you could be rid of your enemy and your ex
in one fell swoop .
david has his daughter and his beloved beach house .
he &apos;s not going anywhere .
but if she &apos;s leaving , what is it she wants from him ?
the only person who &apos;s worth anything is emily .
well , you ask me , she &apos;s worthless ...
as , it turns out , are her friends .
so i will take her down and those who enable her .
i know you think i &apos;m too emotional , but ...
it &apos;s irrelevant . you &apos;re like me , margaux .
once you have a target ,
you will not rest until you hit it .
hey , guys .
dada .
hey , buddy .
carl &apos;s been asking for you all day .
aww , someone &apos;s happy you &apos;re here .
yeah , you must be , too .
got any , uh , big weekend plans for the 4th ?
and if so , is it anything that can be changed ?
it &apos;s mcginty &apos;s .
they ... they want me now .
if i ... if i miss another shift , i &apos;m done there .
yeah , no ... no problem , jack . i completely understand .
hey , i got to go , okay ? i got to go , all right ?
okay .
thank you .
yeah .
it &apos;s okay , carl .
come on . let &apos;s go to the swings .
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay . you &apos;re okay , hon .
i know , baby .
lyman .
did someone die ?
oh , c @-@ c @-@ can &apos;t a big brother just pop by to say hey ?
in most families , maybe ,
but the way you &apos;ve treated me ,
i trust you as far as i can throw you .
and we both know i inherited
feeble aunt faye &apos;s upper @-@ body strength .
so why are you here ?
we &apos;re not kids anymore , lyman .
we don &apos;t have to pretend to like each other .
i &apos;ve ... i &apos;ve been doing some soul @-@ searching ...
and i screwed up .
i &apos;ve cut so many ties , i feel like i might float away .
you &apos;re the only one i feel connected to anymore .
lyman ...
and i &apos;ve spent all these many months
making speeches to people i don &apos;t know ,
trying to get their support .
and now i realize that my journey all this time
has been to get me to look into the eyes of the one person
whose support i can &apos;t do without .
i never pretended to like you , lou .
i never had to .
come on .
i asked for navy @-@ blue napkins , not midnight @-@ blue .
has the silver been polished ?
where are the rest of the florals ?
well , don &apos;t just stand there . move .
yes , ma &apos;am . okay ,
i &apos;m on it .
interviewing for a catering job ?
considering how you served me papers the other day ,
i think you &apos;d be perfect to spoon out the hackleback .
that &apos;s caviar , dear .
oh , i know you &apos;re trying to get a rise out of me ,
but i &apos;m here to make amends , natalie .
i see no reason why we can &apos;t be civil .
so true .
i was just saying the same thing to your former paramour
over drinks the other night .
he is such sparkling company .
oh , but i imagine that sparkle will turn to heartache
once you leave town ... possibly for points west ?
now , wherever would you get that idea ?
i &apos;m thinking of putting down roots right here ...
maybe even with david .
he &apos;s making me dinner tonight ,
and i do love a man who knows his way around the kitchen .
good indication of all sorts of talents .
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me ...
hiring office is just beyond the tennis courts .
emily , what the hell are you doing out here ?
i &apos;m coming with you .
look , i realize that you want to help .
but if you can &apos;t trust me , then i &apos;m --
what margaux has set in motion is not to be taken lightly .
people will get hurt .
i &apos;m not taking it lightly .
look , i &apos;m sure there are a lot of things
that you do better than me , but this ...
this one thing , this twisted chess game with real stakes ,
i am better at than you .
i &apos;m coming .
that should do the trick .
story is airtight .
the birth certificate &apos;s a fake .
you always knew there was a chance .
i assumed common sense would prevail .
what is it about that girl
that makes people act against their own best interests ?
get in touch with him .
reveal the location of the woman .
i don &apos;t make empty threats .
so , what happened ?
i mean ... with april ? how did it end ?
i woke up one morning , and she was packing a suitcase .
just like that ? no explanation ?
well , she said we didn &apos;t make a good team .
apparently , i didn &apos;t surprise her enough .
lame .
anyway , the next guy she met did not have that problem .
of course , in his case ,
she learned that surprising also meant dangerous .
which is when she came to me for help .
must have been tough for you .
nah . it wasn &apos;t , actually .
i @-@ i hated her for what she did to me ,
but , you know , it didn &apos;t replace those other feelings .
you know , they ... they never went away .
it &apos;s weird , right ?
no , i get it .
aiden and i fought as much as we made up .
when i lost him , i ...
... felt like i lost everything .
yeah .
how do you come back from something like that ?
i don &apos;t know if you ever do .
thank you again for dinner .
well , thank you for pretending to like it .
i swear , i think my meatloaf
used to be more meat and less loaf .
and you have all the time in the world to get it right .
and once this independence day soiree is over , i &apos;ll help .
yeah , about the soiree ...
listen , these types of parties are not really my thing , so i ...
oh , no , no .
no , no , no , you have to come .
look , they &apos;re not my thing either ,
but as silly as it sounds ,
it &apos;s what teddy wanted for me .
please ?
besides ... you know what the best part
about picking a girl up for a party is , don &apos;t you ?
you get to be the one to bring her home .
don &apos;t worry . i don &apos;t expect you to roll out the welcome mat .
no , you shouldn &apos;t expect anything from me .
natalie waters is using you .
which translated means you &apos;re afraid
that you &apos;re not gonna see any of edward &apos;s money
and you want me to help try to get it back .
i know that i &apos;m the last person you want to listen to ,
and believe me when i tell you
that you are the last person i want to help .
but she &apos;s our common enemy ,
and you can &apos;t trust that woman .
that woman looked after a dying man
when his family turned their back on him ,
at a time when his son was proven to be the monster
which you tried to convince the world i was .
so unless this is about something else ... ?
oh , if you think this is because i &apos;m jealous ,
then your ego is as warped as your judgment .
natalie &apos;s lying to you . she &apos;s moving to california .
i don &apos;t think so .
no ?
then why did she buy an estate on the pacific ?
as an investment ?
how many houses did you own before karma caught up with you ?
i was just trying to warn you . that &apos;s all .
oh , my goodness ! he &apos;s just a bundle of joy !
he &apos;s putting on a show .
what have we got here ?
nolan , i think that &apos;s your wedding ring .
i must have forgotten to put it back on
after our massage .
well , that thing must be the wrong size
&apos;cause it keeps falling off .
oh , let &apos;s go play .
oh , i could just eat him up !
seriously , pass the maple syrup .
there . do you like that one ?
it &apos;s like you guys have been married for 10 years .
oh . are we that boring already ?
wait ... and is that why
you keep taking everybody &apos;s job offer but mine ?
or is that you &apos;re afraid of running into emily and ben ?
because i ...
this has nothing to do with her or ben .
whatever they have or don &apos;t , i &apos;m not worried about them .
all right . then it is me .
i was right .
what ?
no , it ...
as if it wasn &apos;t bad enough i pissed off every cop
in my precinct by doing the honorable thing ,
now i &apos;m pissing you off , too ?
i don &apos;t want a handout , nolan .
no , i @-@ i ...
look , tables were turned , would you consider it charity
or an opportunity
to work with a great friend and help him out ?
i may have a way to sweeten the deal .
nolan , we &apos;ve got all those empty rooms at the club .
what if we turned one into a daycare center ?
ah ... well , no , actually ...
actually , people have been asking for that .
i mean , i guess it &apos;s preferable to leaving them with the help ?
the only downside is they &apos;re never gonna learn
how to make bread puddin &apos; with bourbon sauce .
all right .
listen , jack ... you can work when you want .
you can bring carl with you .
we will keep an eye on louise
and make sure that she doesn &apos;t eat him .
maybe .
or you can keep inhaling sawdust off the floor at mcginty &apos;s .
come on , jack . what do you say ?
well , i @-@ i say ...
that i can start tonight .
ben ?
hey , april .
how &apos;s it look ?
like you didn &apos;t tell me everything .
if he did , you &apos;d probably be as far away from him as possible .
from what i understand , you &apos;ve been hiding
from an ex @-@ con named wes perkins .
wow . who else knows ?
i mean , please tell me that you &apos;re not heading up
the witness protection program or anything .
april , come on .
it &apos;s kim .
i had to ditch my life thanks to you .
you ?
so what ? you told her some things , just not everything ?
see , this is why i wanted to come alone .
look , a few months after i took up with wes ,
i went to ben one night to talk about him .
you went to the husband you left
for advice about the guy you were sleeping with ?
we were best friends , ben .
and i didn &apos;t come to you for help or for protection
or because you were a cop ... you knew that .
you told me how he fenced stolen goods
out of a warehouse in queens and that you were scared .
i wasn &apos;t gonna let that stand , and you knew it .
so i called in a raid .
which i sure as hell didn &apos;t want .
because when the cops found squat ,
wes knew that i was the one that talked ,
and he was gonna make damn sure that that never happened again .
so i had to disappear , thanks to you .
he was trying to protect you .
i didn &apos;t ask him to .
by showing up , you did .
look , we &apos;re running out of time .
by now , wes probably knows where you are ,
and that is my fault , not ben &apos;s .
you two are a perfect match .
we need to get you out of here .
you walk into my life after 10 years ,
try to upend it all over again ?
i &apos;m not going anywhere .
what do you think ?
absolutely not .
you hate my dress ?
no , the , uh , dress kills .
absolutely not to your brother staying with us .
he &apos;s turned over a new leaf .
leaves change , politicians don &apos;t .
well , this one has .
look , nolan . my daddy &apos;s dead .
and in my eyes , so is my mama .
so lyman wants to reconcile , then ...
maybe i want that , too .
besides , i ... kind of already said yes .
without asking me ?
lou , see , all i have tried to do is protect you .
i mean , do you even know what it means to be in a ...
in a marriage , in a partnership ?
yes , i do .
it means we both bring our baggage
and our eccentricities into this union ,
and it is our job to respect each other &apos;s quirks ...
among mine , being my family .
and mine ?
how about the fact ...
that you keep losing your wedding ring
and i find it all over the house
and i return it back to you without once asking you
why you keep taking it off ?
because i respect you enough not to ask .
so why can &apos;t you give me the same respect ?
well , memory serves , you &apos;ve got a yacht
that lyman can stay on ...
well , unless the sea makes him as sick
as his presence makes me .
almost ready .
you are a very patient man .
take your time .
everything all right ?
david .
it &apos;s time you know the truth ... i am a klutz .
tripped on my stiletto ,
went right into the makeup table .
teddy used to say it made me endearing .
really , all it does is make me bruise .
do you need some ice ?
maybe some aspirin ? there might be some in my purse .
find anything ?
uh , sure did .
ah . thanks .
she said i &apos;m thoughtless and controlling .
you put a daycare center down the hall
so i can bring my kid to work .
that &apos;s not thoughtless .
what about controlling ?
&apos;cause now she &apos;s mad at me . i &apos;m mad at her .
this is still a fake marriage , right ?
uh , it &apos;s tricky .
are you attracted to her ?
jack , have you seen her ?
everyone from southampton to the south pole
is attracted ...
yes , but that doesn &apos;t mean
that they should be married to her .
and that brings me to the other thing .
this ring ... no one &apos;s attracted to me when i wear it .
look , it &apos;s clear to me that you want two different things ,
which means you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing .
no . jack , i don &apos;t .
i mean , at least that &apos;s the one constant in ...
every twisted relationship i &apos;ve ever had .
well , something to chew on .
something to talk to your wife about .
but do yourself a favor ...
figure it out over something other than gin .
uh , natalie , david .
hi .
ms. waters , you &apos;ve managed to throw the party of the summer ...
... and with david clarke on your arm no less .
so , i &apos;ll go find us some drinks .
all right .
so , what &apos;s it like to date him ?
well , as we all know , he &apos;s been through a lot .
so it &apos;s not all sunshine and rainbows .
hmm , how do you mean ?
you see flashes of this or that , and there are ...
there are moments when i hardly recognize him .
but then he &apos;s back , and ...
are you saying that you &apos;re scared of him ?
no . god , no . no , i would never say that .
whatever it is he &apos;s going through ,
i &apos;m sure i can handle it .
enjoy the party .
can we get a photo , please ?
oh , that &apos;s quite a portrait you &apos;re painting .
trouble in paradise ?
don &apos;t worry about me . i &apos;ll be fine .
oh , i have no doubt .
well , look , sis , i don &apos;t want to be the cause
of any , uh , strife .
i can find another place to live .
lyman , no . you &apos;re my family .
well , in your case , family hasn &apos;t always been so reliable .
i mean , nolan &apos;s right about that .
that &apos;s just because he doesn &apos;t know you like i do .
remember when we were kids , how much i looked up to you ?
god , i used to follow you around so much
it was like you had a second shadow .
well , now all i have
is your husband &apos;s eyes on the back of my neck .
it &apos;s best i respect his wishes .
yeah , i just wish he &apos;d respect mine .
well , it &apos;s your call ,
but i @-@ i @-@ i say don &apos;t let your old family sink your new one .
see ...
why can &apos;t he just see this side of you ?
hello , april . been a long time .
the hell are you ?
the last person you want to play with .
oh ! let go of me .
maybe second to last .
all right , nolan . &quot; money where your mouth is &quot; time .
i &apos;m clocking out , and i &apos;m taking carl to bay park
to see the fireworks .
uh , and i insist you do .
don &apos;t you mean to say that , &quot; i know that we discussed this ,
but i need you to stick around for another hour &quot; ?
all right , first , that &apos;s a terrible impression of me .
and second of all , uh , we all have cause to celebrate .
ems called ... turns out she and ben
have managed to thwart lady lemarchal &apos;s attempts
to rattle our collective cages .
yes , punches were thrown .
she took ben with her ?
aw , jack , don &apos;t worry about it .
i mean , their little road trip
was more ... revenge than romance .
yeah ? who got punched ?
kidding .
mostly .
anyways , look , i hope that margaux realizes
it &apos;s time to drop this vendetta .
i ... it &apos;s not her .
it &apos;s kind of becoming her .
rule of the red sharpie --
it &apos;s hard to put that cap back on .
but ... well , that doesn &apos;t concern you .
go check out the , uh , right kind of fireworks .
enjoying yourself , mr. ellis ?
i am now .
and how about you ?
this isn &apos;t exactly your holiday .
now , please don &apos;t tell me
you &apos;ve been using my retainer for one .
the key to nolan ross &apos; house .
baby sis just wants her family .
and as for my wants ...
well , kudos for earning your sister &apos;s trust .
now finish earning mine ,
and you get the rest of your fee .
nolan ross &apos; secrets are somewhere in that house .
find them . and then find me .
watch your head .
so , after he , uh --
he swung at me , i hid behind the counter .
i was scared for my life .
luckily , i saw what was going on ,
and i was able to disarm and subdue the assailant .
what happens now ?
well , the sheet says he &apos;s got two strikes already .
so this makes him a lifer .
it means you &apos;ve got nothing to worry about , ma &apos;am .
take care .
thank you .
i don &apos;t even know what to say .
i mean , i do . i do .
thank you both for coming to warn me
and for not leaving until it got through .
i know i can be ... pretty stubborn sometimes .
trust me , i &apos;m the same .
well , i guess he &apos;s got a type .
i &apos;m sorry . i just had to steal you away .
the fireworks are starting soon .
oh , i think we can make a much better show .
what are you doing ?
you monster ! get your hands off of me !
you &apos;re setting me up .
no one will ever believe you .
which is why i informed the reporter earlier
that you &apos;re a deeply disturbed man ...
i just thought i could handle it .
david , no ! you &apos;re hurting me !
you gonna destroy conrad &apos;s watch , too ?
&quot; to bunny , eternally yours ... conrad . &quot;
i recognized it in your purse .
see , i had a secretary once who had the exact same watch .
lydia davis was a vile whore .
conrad grayson loved me .
he promised me everything when he died .
you aren &apos;t the first girl that he seduced with his estate ,
but you might be the most deluded and ambitious .
you didn &apos;t get conrad &apos;s money ,
so you went after his dying father ?
and the bastard was intent on leaving victoria everything .
i starved him until he had no choice
but to pick up the damn pen and sign the new will .
so why come after me ?
aww , honey .
conrad always wanted me to live like a grayson ,
and that &apos;s not just about the money .
it &apos;s about the power ...
the power to make people believe anything you want .
ruining you was among his greatest accomplishments .
so you want the world to hate me .
conrad did .
maybe he &apos;ll rest better
knowing that i &apos;ve finished what he started .
or alternatively ,
when you eventually see him in hell ,
maybe you can tell him yourself .
victoria . get out of here .
oh , i have nowhere to go until monday &apos;s court hearing .
or ...
i starved him until he had no choice ...
... you could simply sign everything over to me .
that way , i retain my rightful inheritance ,
and you won &apos;t have to go to prison .
oh , and , bunny ,
if you &apos;re planning on staying in town ,
don &apos;t worry about money .
i hear the beach club is hiring .
my , oh , my , the things these people have done ,
all in the name of this amanda clarke .
call me when you get this .
lyman ?
what are you doing ?
uh , l @-@ louise this , uh ... i @-@ i know how this looks .
like you &apos;re stealing information off my husband &apos;s computer ?
i trusted you .
get out of my house .
now , l @-@ louise , you give me that back .
louise .
louise , give me that .
you played me for a fool .
yeah , well , your new friends played you first !
otherwise , why &apos;s your husband got a hidden computer behind the bureau ?
these are not good people , louise .
my people are just fine .
let &apos;s talk about your people .
how much is margaux lemarchal paying you ?
how do you know about that ?
because i &apos;m not a fool !
and i have a much better throwing arm than aunt faye .
no !
i guess this is technically your fourth of july party now .
not with this decor .
what will you do with all the money coming your way ?
i &apos;ll use it to ensure that the daniel grayson foundation
restores my boy &apos;s good name .
it &apos;ll take time .
but i can see no cause more worthwhile .
well , on the subject of names , uh , i want to thank you
for making sure that mine wasn &apos;t ruined -- again .
well ... i guess there &apos;s a silver lining to not killing me after all .
are you ready to see the fireworks , pal , huh ?
come on . seriously ?
well , if it isn &apos;t former officer porter .
enjoying your free time ?
maybe a little too much ?
what is it , schaefer ?
we received a tip there &apos;s a drunk driver on the road
in a truck that matches yours .
well , you pulled over the wrong one .
i haven &apos;t had anything to drink all night .
so can i go ?
i &apos;m just trying to take my kid to bay park for fireworks .
and i &apos;m just doing my job ,
or have you already forgotten police protocol ?
step out of the car .
wes perkins was arrested for assault earlier this evening .
nothing will be traced back to you .
emily is one step ahead ... always .
can &apos;t say the same for the rest of them .
jack porter was taken care of .
good .
as for nolan ross ,
i expect the contents of his well @-@ protected hard drive
will be more than enough to ruin them all .
i should have it within the hour .
here you are .
and i searched the whole party for you .
i left early .
nolan .
i did something bad .
no .
no , you didn &apos;t .
i did .
louise , i know this marriage is untraditional ,
but so are we .
and we still have a lot to figure out .
but while we do , lyman is ...
welcome to stay .
more than welcome .
i &apos;m so glad you said that .
because he &apos;s in the guest room right now .
he , uh ...
had a few too many and passed out .
yeah , of course he did .
it &apos;s been a long day .
talk in the morning ?
mm @-@ hmm .
wonder twins .
so , if you &apos;re margaux , what do you do next ?
whatever it is ,
she &apos;s desperate , which makes her dangerous .
she &apos;ll keep looking for ...
vulnerabilities and weaknesses ...
mine and my friends . i mean ...
going after your first love was ruthless
and ... smart .
a person &apos;s first love is their weak spot .
just like daniel proved to be hers .
so , who &apos;s yours ?
my what ?
your weak spot .
jack .
jack ?
jack , was your first lo ... - no , ben ... jack .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m trying to figure out .
we got a call .
i &apos;m telling you , there &apos;s something wrong .
i , uh ... you know me .
i wouldn &apos;t drink and get behind the wheel .
your blew point 14 . against the car , porter .
ted , we &apos;ve got a kid here .
no , no , no ! you &apos;re not taking him ! no !
get your hands off my kid ! get your hands off me !
you &apos;re not taking my kid ! you &apos;re not taking my kid !
come on ! come on ! let him go !
let him go ! give him to me ! god , no !
