cheryl ? can i call you back ?
okay . great . bye .
yes ? what ?
hey , yeah ...
i was going through your drawer in the bathroom
looking for some lip stuff because my ...
lips were dry .
god , you know me .
phil ...
remember the spa certificates we got
at the children &apos;s hospital auction ?
mm @-@ hmm .
well , look at this -- they expire tomorrow .
oh , wow . what are you gonna do ?
claire , i don &apos;t think you &apos;re grasping the magnitude
of this package , valued at over $ 250 .
sweetie ...
if you don &apos;t use them ,
then all our money just goes to charity .
and so what am i supposed to do ?
somewhere between dropping off alex at orchestra
and picking up luke from practice --
oh , and burning a bunch of dvds of the talent show ,
i &apos;m gonna , what , pop in for a quick salt scrub ?
i thought cheryl was doing the dvds .
well , she &apos;s supposed to ,
but somehow she &apos;s got me doing it .
here &apos;s what you do .
say , &quot; cheryl , no can do today .
need a little &apos; me time . &apos; &quot;
have you met cheryl ?
that &apos;ll be my new nickname .
i &apos;ll be claire &quot; me time &quot; dunphy .
it &apos;s not worth the headache .
just say you &apos;re sick .
then i run into her , and it &apos;ll be a whole thing .
well , if that happens ,
you say you &apos;re on your way to the pharmacy to --
phil , darling , no , not helping .
fine . i &apos;ll give them to florence gunderman at work .
her hands look gross ever since she took up the banjo .
hey , mom , i need some money for lunch .
we &apos;re all gonna go to --
oh , my god ! take off my sweater !
mom , tell her to take it off !
alex , take it off .
last week , she wore my sweatshirt without asking .
that is true .
oh , please -- that was an honor
for your stupid old sweatshirt .
it was the first time the top half got any exercise .
now , mom , that &apos;s my favorite sweater !
i just got it .
you know what you girls need to learn to do ?
you need to learn to share ,
because that &apos;s what sisters do .
all right , haley , nothing &apos;s gonna happen to your sweater .
right , alex ?
hmm ?
okay , fine .
then i will just go put on your favorite nerdy t @-@ shirt ,
the one with the guy from &quot; back to the future &quot; on it .
that &apos;s albert einstein !
and it is not nerdy !
well ...
hi !
hey , daddy . how was the farmers &apos; market ?
well , it was great , but guess what the new spinach is .
um , radicchio ?
kale .
no !
i know . i was just as blown away as you are .
oh , well , i guess we &apos;re going to have to adopt --
yay --
a new attitude towards kale .
maybe we &apos;ll even adopt a new vinaigrette .
adopt , yay !
okay , what &apos;s going on here ?
i &apos;m taking the negative charge
out of the word &quot; adopted . &quot; yay .
what did oprah do now ?
well , she had a girl on
who , at 16 , found out that she was adopted
and felt betrayed , ran away , and became a stripper --
and not the heart @-@ of @-@ gol kind , the by @-@ the @-@ airport kind .
okay .
all right . go get your gavel , judge judy .
no , not at all . i &apos;m adopting
a tolerant attitude toward your flights of lunacy .
adopting !
alex , come on . hurry up .
the later we are ,
the more cheryl texts me to do .
i &apos;m coming , i &apos;m coming .
tell me again why the violin just wasn &apos;t you .
it &apos;s too happy .
oh , my god !
okay , hang on . hang on . hang on .
let &apos;s see . it might not be a big deal .
just -- here we go . let &apos;s see .
oh , okay .
is it bad ?
no , it &apos;s gonna be fine . you &apos;re gonna be okay .
oh , honey .
hey , i forgot my phone .
hi .
what ?
nothing . i love you .
so weird .
you better not spill anything on that , okay , dork ?
relax . half the 11th grade &apos;s been inside this sweater .
more than anything
i want my girls to stop fighting and be close .
i want them to share clothes and do each other &apos;s hair
and gossip about boys --
like i used to do with mitchell .
gloria ! let &apos;s go , let &apos;s go , let &apos;s go !
hey , jay , have you noticed a spring in my step ?
oh , kids say cruel things .
that doesn &apos;t mean you &apos;ll turn out that way .
no . we have something in common .
i &apos;m seeing a younger woman .
how much younger are we talking about ?
13 months . her name &apos;s chloe .
she makes me feel like a 5th grader again .
good for you , kid .
hmm . there they are -- my two dirty old men .
hey , pretty soon you &apos;re gonna be north of 40
and i &apos;m gonna have to trade you in for a newer model .
am i right , buddy ?
that &apos;s my mother , jay .
you ready ?
it &apos;s such a beautiful day . why do we have to do this ?
because when this thing is behind us ,
it &apos;s done and we never have to think about it again .
come on .
i went to a funeral last saturday , and it got me thinking
about where gloria and i were gonna end up after we die .
yeah , it &apos;s been a fun week .
i don &apos;t like loose ends .
so i made a few calls .
i found these people selling a couple of primo plots
in the best cemetery in town .
not that i &apos;m gonna go there anytime soon .
don &apos;t be so sure ...
with all the bacon that he eats .
well , got to give my cholesterol pills
something to do .
mm . i don &apos;t care how much they promote it ,
kale is a garnish .
it &apos;s not ready to anchor a meal .
look at this .
oh , my god ! lily &apos;s little hat
that we bought her at the airport in vietnam .
remember how cute she looked in that ?
remember how i used to wear it
and walk around and act like i had a giant head ?
mm @-@ hmm . that was good acting .
so , what are you doing ?
i &apos;m putting together a little scrapbook
of how lily became ours .
you know , her adoption certificate ,
some pictures of her from her village --
all out in the open , so she has nothing to be ashamed of .
you leaving that on all day ?
you know , and i &apos;m also gonna write a little storybook --
you know , something i can read her at bedtime .
it &apos;s called &quot; two monkeys and a panda . &quot;
she &apos;s the panda because she &apos;s asian .
and we &apos;re monkeys because ...
i can draw monkeys .
okay , well , i think this is a great project ,
and i believe you are gonna finish it .
oh , my god .
what ?
lily &apos;s adoption certificate .
her name is &quot; lily tucker pritchett . &quot;
right .
not &quot; tucker @-@ pritchett &quot; like it &apos;s supposed to be .
first name -- &quot; lily . &quot; middle name -- &quot; tucker . &quot;
last name -- &quot; pritchett . &quot;
well , that can &apos;t be right .
this is a legal document !
she only has your last name .
m @-@ m @-@ my name is just a middle name !
stay calm . don &apos;t get upset .
nobody knows anyone &apos;s middle name !
quick -- what &apos;s my middle name ? - scott .
of course you know mine . we &apos;re a couple !
okay , look , t @-@ this is obviously a mistake .
but you &apos;re the one who filled out this paperwork .
you don &apos;t make mistakes like this .
you correct mistakes like this .
you did this on purpose .
what ?
you buried my name ,
so your name could have top billing .
okay , no , i am not gonnsit here and listen
to you accuse me of something so horrible !
it makes so much sense now --
why you wanted to fill out all these legal forms .
okay , well , i &apos;m a lawyer !
i fill out all the legal forms ,
ever since you signed up for a 12 @-@ year gym membership !
the more you spend , the more you save !
all the women i work with are too busy to use the certificate .
so i called the spa
and asked them to extend the expiration date .
but they said no .
really ?
here &apos;s something they didn &apos;t count on .
you mess with phil dunphy , the claws come out .
you have very nice hands .
soft like lady &apos;s .
thank you , kim . i appreciate that .
my wife never seems to notice .
this is it ! ta @-@ da !
what is ta @-@ da ?
i &apos;m just saying this is it . ta @-@ da .
&quot; ta @-@ da &quot; is when you do a flip
or where the magician cuts the pretty lady in half ,
not when you show someone
where you want to shove their dead body .
i &apos;m not gonna argue the proper use of &quot; ta @-@ da . &quot;
this is it .
seriously ? in the file cabinet ?
it &apos;s called a crypt .
and how are you not getting how great this is ?
we &apos;re four down from bugsy siegel .
no . i &apos;m not going into any wall .
i &apos;m going in the ground .
sorry , not me .
there &apos;s enough to not like about death
without adding dirt and worms .
the whole thing gives me the willies .
you die , you go to the ground .
is natural . you go back to the earth .
here , you &apos;re just a mushy bag of bones
rotting away for all eternity !
sorry for your loss .
can we get the hell out of here ?
what am i supposed to tell the guy ?
tell them we don &apos;t want our bodies
inside these drawers where god cannot find us !
these are not like our drawers at home .
people can find things in these .
i &apos;m thinking of getting bangs .
ooh , you totally should .
you would be so cute with bangs .
you have the face for it . i don &apos;t .
oh , there &apos;s my better half .
kim , would you mind ?
hey , honey . where are you ?
oh , i &apos;m on my way to downey .
oh , uh , did you know
karen and richard carpenter grew up in downey ?
what random and not @-@ helpful fact , phil .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m -- i &apos;m having kind of a rough day .
yeah , i &apos;m kind of having a rough day myself .
look , phil , i need you to take care of dinner for me .
what &apos;s wrong ?
oh , alex ripped haley &apos;s favorite sweater ,
and now i &apos;m driving around from store to store ,
trying to find the exact same one before haley finds out .
don &apos;t do that . just explain to her what happened .
haley &apos;s not gonna understand .
sure , she will .
no , phil , you don &apos;t understand .
i &apos;m trying to avoid this turning into a whole big thing .
then just get her something close .
she &apos;ll never know the difference .
phil , could you just take care of dinner , sweetie ?
that &apos;s all i &apos;m asking . that &apos;s it .
i &apos;m just saying , there &apos;s a simpler way to do this .
there is no simpler way . just make dinner !
thank you .
hello ?
what ?
mr. pritchett ...
we &apos;re the rutledges ,
the ones selling the spots .
hi .
hi .
oh , my gosh . look , honey .
i hadn &apos;t heard . martin is in .
well , look at that .
i &apos;m sorry . is that a friend of yours ?
we &apos;ve made a point
to get to know everyone in the neighborhood .
we think it makes it less awkward , you know , later .
oh , i &apos;m sorry . this is my wife , gloria .
i &apos;m ed , and this is my bunk .
and this is my loving wife
and devoted mother of three , winnie .
she &apos;ll be here .
i don &apos;t know what our lineup is yet .
but at home , i sleep on the right side .
so probably there .
we don &apos;t mean to be rude ,
but you seem to be much younger than your husband .
you &apos;re not rude . i &apos;m very much younger .
is that a problem ?
well , it &apos;s just that there &apos;s a good chance ,
uh , you &apos;ll be moving in long before she would .
our concern is , your wife remarries ,
and wants to be laid to rest with her new husband .
so she sells this spot to the highest bidder .
and we &apos;re left lying next to a complete stranger ,
without even so much as a formal &quot; how do you do ? &quot;
gloria , tell them you &apos;re in .
i don &apos;t know , jay . i think they have a very good point .
and they &apos;re not crazy at all .
what do you mean they have a good point ?
i don &apos;t think this is going to work .
good luck getting someone into your drawers .
it occurs to me
that i may have gotten a little too upset
and jumped to some conclusions
that were perhaps not true .
i realize now that you would
never intentionally do something so unthinkable .
so ...
i just wanted to say i &apos;m sorry for accusing you .
i did it .
i knew it ! you two @-@ faced --
let me explain . there is --
there is no explanation . there is just no excuse .
i just want to know why !
okay , y @-@ you know how , um , s @-@ some women say
that they forget how painful childbirth was ?
well , i @-@ i @-@ i think that you are forgetting
how panicked you were before we got lily .
you were freaking out .
i was not !
okay , so , it says that we can put the mattress
at one of three different levels .
which one should we do ?
i don &apos;t know .
well , just think about how far down she should be .
how far -- - i don &apos;t know ! i can &apos;t do this !
okay .
oh , this latch system is great .
what did people do before this ?
i don &apos;t know ! stop asking me questions !
cam ...
i can &apos;t do this ! i can &apos;t !
okay , well , i ...
i don &apos;t see what that has to do with anything .
i @-@ i was scared that -- that it was just gonna all be
too much for you and that you were gonna leave .
and then i would be the one taking care of a baby
and half of her last name
would belong to the guy who left us .
it was a mistake . i &apos;m sorry .
i @-@ i wanted to have it changed ,
but i needed to get your signature ,
and i was afraid that it would start a big fight
and that you would hate me and ...
ok , i &apos;m confused .
you &apos;re saying that if she tells me she has a problem ,
i &apos;m not supposed to help her ?
not unless she asks for your help .
but if she lets me help her ,
i can make her problem go away .
that is such a male thing to say .
well , forgive me for being a man .
mango or kiwi ?
ooh , kiwi .
when you say , you know , &quot; do this or do that , &quot;
all she &apos;s hearing is , &quot; i &apos;m smarter than you . &quot;
believe me , she doesn &apos;t think that .
she doesn &apos;t want you to save her problems .
she just wants you to give her support
so that she can solve her problems herself .
yes , and sometimes --
sometimes she just wants a sympathetic ear .
maybe it &apos;s all the creams ,
but that just made sense , girlfriends .
so if claire says , &quot; i hate getting stuck in traffic , &quot;
i shouldn &apos;t say , &quot; maybe you should leave earlier ... &quot;
no .
... or , &quot; don &apos;t get on the freeway . &quot;
no .
i should just say , &quot; i know . it &apos;s so frustrating . &quot;
yes ! that &apos;s it !
really ?
yes ! yes !
and -- and if she says , uh , uh ...
&quot; the waiter i had today was so rude , &quot;
i shouldn &apos;say , &quot; maybe you should just order
something on the menu for once . &quot;
no .
i should just say , &quot; what a jerk . &quot;
yes ! yes ! yeah !
and if she says , &quot; phil , the tv &apos;s driving me crazy , &quot;
i should just say , &quot; i know !
there is not enough quality programming for men . &quot;
no ! turn off the damn tv .
okay , now i &apos;m confused again .
so , i heard you had a rough time today .
yeah , well ...
remember the days when we thought we &apos;d live forever ?
don &apos;t you want to go play ?
when do i ever play ?
i &apos;m kind of wrestling
with this whole &quot; older man , younger woman &quot; thing .
it &apos;s like chloe and i grew up in different worlds .
today i made a joke about the wiggles .
it went right over her head .
i don &apos;t know what that is .
it &apos;s an expression -- means she didn &apos;t get it .
yeah , it sometimes -- this age thing --
knocks you in the head .
that what this is about ?
i always knew your mother might remarry after i &apos;m gone .
that never bothered me .
i figured her husbands would be your dad , me ,
and some putz who could never live up to me .
but what if i &apos;m not the main guy ?
what if some other guy is ?
what if i &apos;m the putz ?
when my mom and dad got divorced ,
do you have any idea how many guys chased after her ?
the phone didn &apos;t stop ringing .
men would stop her on the street .
guys would propose to her from moving cars .
they were good @-@ looking guys , jay -- with money .
i think one of them was a kennedy .
where are you going with this ?
when you showed up , i didn &apos;t think you had a prayer .
you were so nervous and sweaty , i felt sorry for you .
i had to climb three flights of stairs .
but of all people , my mom fell for you .
i got a few moves .
she said she fell in love with you during your first fight .
what ?
she said she &apos;d finally met her match .
oh .
so if you think she &apos;s just gonna replace you
when you &apos;re gone ,
then you are the putz .
thanks , kid.i appreciate that .
i thought you liked me when i first showed up .
please . for the first month ,
i didn &apos;t even bother to learn your name .
is she back yet ?
she &apos;s on her way .
did you find it ?
i did .
at the fifth store i went to .
it was in the window , and i had to undress a mannequin
while a creepy guy filmed it ,
so we have to look forward to on the internet .
thank you so much , mom .
you &apos;re welcome .
now , go put that exactly where you found the other one , okay ?
okay .
uh @-@ oh .
what ? the security tag
it &apos;s still on !
i told those people to take that off .
oh , no .
she &apos;s pulling into the driveway !
okay . it &apos;s fine . it &apos;s fine .
don &apos;t panic . i &apos;ve got it . i &apos;ve got it .
she &apos;s getting out of the car !
all right ! i am doing it !
i &apos;ve almost got it . i -- oh , god ! oh , no !
what is that ? !
well , it &apos;s ink .
aah ! hide it . hide it .
she &apos;s in the house !
what are you doing with my sweater ?
oh , my god ! it &apos;s ruined !
it was an accident !
i knew this would happen , you idiot !
hey , hey ! let &apos;s try to get along .
i wish she was never even born !
they were trying to make one with a brain !
not fair ! honey , you guys are both ...
oh ... pretty smart .
ohh ...
geez .
it &apos;s that sweater , huh ?
yeah . it is that sweater .
and i did everything i can to stop them from fighting .
i don &apos;t understand .
why they can &apos;t see how much you love them .
i don &apos;t know .
meanwhile , cheryl has be calling me all day
because she &apos;s angry i didn &apos;t show up .
doesn &apos;t cheryl have a housekeeper and a nanny ?
why does she need so much help ?
i know , right ?
you work so hard .
you do so much .
i do .
of course you do .
i do .
i do .
oh , sweetie , thank you .
i really appreciate that .
hey .
yeah ?
who &apos;s my gal ?
i am .
darn right . yeah .
oh . let me get this .
hey , by the way --
notice anything different about me ?
unh @-@ unh .
huh .
hmm . what is it ?
nothing .
a haircut ?
a week ago .
okay , so , tell me .
forget it . it &apos;s not important .
okay . i &apos;ll just go start dinner .
listen , i &apos;ve been thinking .
when i go ,
i want you to know ...
it &apos;s okay if you marry someone else .
i know .
because i want you be happy .
i &apos;ll be happy .
you &apos;re driving me crazy on purpose , right ?
jay , i &apos;m not going to marry anyone else .
that &apos;s what you say now ,
but no one knows what the future holds .
so i want you to have this .
look at this ,
an empty coffee can .
do you know what men used to buy me ?
when i go , toss me in the fire ,
sweep up my ashes , stick &apos; em in that .
ta @-@ da !
we need to talk about this &quot; ta @-@ da . &quot;
&apos;cause i don &apos;t care if it &apos;s in a wall
or if it &apos;s in the ground --
just as long as i end up with you .
oh , jay .
it &apos;s perfect .
jay pritchett sitting on the mantel in the old coffee can .
that will drive the putz crazy . and i like that .
um , so , f @-@ for whatever it &apos;s worth ,
i @-@ i called the adoption attorney --
adoption , yay !
and on monday , they &apos;re gonna start the process
of changing lily &apos;s last name to &quot; tucker @-@ pritchett . &quot;
great .
again , i &apos;m -- i &apos;m so sorry .
okay .
um ... oh , i , uh ...
i took a quick pass at &quot; two monkeys and a panda . &quot;
so , just let me know what you think .
&quot; once upon a time ,
there were two monkeys .
they loved each other very much ,
but there was something missing . &quot;
a hyphen ?
&quot; they wanted a baby .
and they heard that there was a very special baby
in a faraway land who needed a family .
she was a panda named lily .
one of the monkeys was scared .
they &apos;d never had a panda before .
but they held lily in their arms ,
and the scared monkey became the brave one .
and the two monkeys -- &quot;
coco and miko .
i &apos;m sorry . what ?
&quot; coco &quot; and &quot; miko &quot; are the names of the monkeys .
really ?
that doesn &apos;t seem like it &apos;s a little un--
coco and miko . i like that . i like that .
coco and miko -- yeah .
&quot; they traveled all the way home
with the perfect panda that they adopted . &quot;
did she just clap ?
she heard &quot; adopted &quot; and clapped !
cam ! that &apos;s amazing !
oh , my god ! you did that !
well , i don &apos;t ...
what ? !
you did that . that is amazing . i can &apos;t believe that .
and just like that , peace returned to our house .
well , technically , i @-@ it &apos;s my house , but ...
i @-@ i will -- i will fix that , too .
once we finished writing the book ,
we realized something .
we &apos;re not the only two monkeys with the panda ,
gay parents are a huge market ,
and no one &apos;s writing for them .
we thought we were sitting on a gold mine .
but we weren &apos;t .
&quot; gay parenting . &quot;
&quot; gay adoptive parenting . &quot;
okay .
&quot; gay adoption : foreign children . &quot; wow .
&quot; gay adoption : asian children . &quot;
what ?
&quot; bisexual adoption : asian children . &quot;
&quot; transgendered adoption . &quot;
