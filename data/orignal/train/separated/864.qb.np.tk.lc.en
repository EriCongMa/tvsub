back in the &apos; 80s ,
you couldn &apos;t keep up with all the new dance styles .
there was breakin &apos; , poppin &apos; and lockin &apos; , the running man ,
and something called the electric boogaloo .
unfortunately , i had two left feet .
i often found walking a hard enough challenge .
you okay ?
me ? yeah .
been working out a lot .
my quads locked up on me . that ever happen to you ?
um , no .
das coo &apos; , das coo &apos; .
here you go .
well , thanks for the help .
hey , um , you going to the dance friday ?
are you going ?
yeah , maybe .
save me a dance ?
oh , definitely .
sounds scrumptious .
dana was amazing .
she wanted to dance with me , and she didn &apos;t care
that i used words like &quot; scrumptious . &quot;
nothing was gonna bring me down .
adam !
hurry up ! we &apos;re late for your dentist appointment !
well , almost nothing .
do you need to make ... ?
make poo @-@ poos ?
i know you refuse to go at school ,
but we don &apos;t have time to stop at home ,
so if you have to make poo @-@ poos , then make poo @-@ poos here .
oh , my god ! i &apos;m fine ! just let me in and let &apos;s go !
well , first , tell me who that girl was .
what girl ? there was no girl .
you were talking to dana caldwell .
why do you ask me a question if you already know the answer ?
unlock the door !
what were you talking about ?
nothing !
what were you talking about ?
nothing !
were you talking about the dance ?
tell me everything .
let &apos;s just go to the dentist already !
what were you talking about ?
oh , my god !
i &apos;m the one kid in this world
who &apos;s looking forward to getting his teeth drilled .
sheesh . all right , captain no fun .
with a smother like mine ,
you have to shut her down fast .
you can &apos;t open the door , even a crack .
drive !
so , then , dana asked adam if he was going to the dance ,
and adam said yes .
so , then , she said to save her a dance .
how do you know all this if you were in the car ?
sometimes a mother just knows .
and i trained myself to read lips a little bit .
huh . read my lips .
you need help .
murray , this is a big deal .
our baby has his first girlfriend .
i think you know what that means .
it &apos;s time for the talk .
what talk ?
you know , about the birds and the bees
and what they do when they &apos;ve had a couple of white wines
and put on a lionel richie record ?
yeah , that talk . not for me .
not for you ? you &apos;re his father .
just give him the same talk you gave barry .
ooh , here &apos;s the thing -- i never did that .
what ? !
you were supposed to talk that talk with him
about three years ago !
i know . i know . what can i say ?
it got away from me .
well , do it now .
what &apos;s the rush ?
there &apos;s not , like , a line outside of his bedroom .
murray !
fine !
no , you are a pain in my ass !
that &apos;s right . i read lips .
it was november 22 , 1980 @-@ something ,
and i was gonna learn to dance .
what do you mean you don &apos;t know how to dance ?
you &apos;re my grandson .
you &apos;ve got rhythm in your blood !
i &apos;m an open book . teach me .
as always , my grandfather would give me all the answers i needed .
he had never failed me before .
a @-@ shuffle and a @-@ cha !
a @-@ shuffle and a @-@ cha !
a @-@ squibbidy bee , a @-@ squibbidy boo !
a @-@ squibbidy bee , a @-@ squibbidy boo !
and we take a break &apos; cause my foot is swollen !
there was a first time for everything .
i had to find another teacher .
erica , teach me to dance , and fast !
w @-@ what did he say ? come on ! then what did he say ?
please ! i need to learn how to move my body to music !
lainey &apos;s in crisis .
her parents bought her a new car and it &apos;s yellow !
what &apos;s the matter , litt buddy ?
got a problem barry can solve ?
no .
you &apos;ll just make fun of me .
what ?
i would never do that .
fine . i need someone to teach me how to dance .
loser .
but you came to the right guy .
but i &apos;m not coming to you .
let &apos;s do this .
when are you gonna start dancing ?
shut up !
my body &apos;s becoming one with the beat .
airplane !
the wave !
crab legs !
helicopter !
and turtle spin !
breakin &apos; .
how does any of this help me ?
i need to learn how to dance with a girl !
yeah , i can &apos;t help you with that . but i can help you with this .
the worm !
after i got an ice pack for barry &apos;s face ,
i decided to teach myself how to dance
because time was running out .
mm , get funky , snuggle monkey .
wait , what ? t @-@ this isn &apos;t &quot; the a @-@ team . &quot;
no , leave it on . we dance to that in jazzercize .
maybe i was desperate , or maybe i was just hypnotized
by my mom &apos;s surprisingly sweet moves .
mom ...
do you think you could teach me how to do that ?
i let her in the door .
get over here .
for the first time , my mother and i
were on the same team with the same goal .
there you go . perfect .
and feel free to jazz it up with some head movements .
no one &apos;s gonna tell you you &apos;re moving your head too much .
look -- we &apos;re kid &apos; n play !
john travolta . there you go .
it was awesome ... until this .
well , this has been great . see ya !
wait a minute , mister .
i &apos;m not letting you go before i teach you how to slow dance .
no . no way . not interested .
sweetie , i know you better than anyone .
i know this is what &apos;s stressing you out --
hand placement , where do you look ,
how do you keep from stepping on her feet .
those are all valid questions , yes .
i had come this far . i couldn &apos;t turn back now .
screw it . let &apos;s do this .
first , you , uh , put your hands on my waist .
no , thank you .
adam , i &apos;m your mother .
that &apos;s the point !
just rock back and forth , very gently .
right ... and left .
right ... left .
what are you doing ? !
ohh ! no snuggies ! no snuggies !
you smell like the dryer .
no snuggies !
honey , you &apos;re so yummy !
that &apos;s not cool . i &apos;m out of here .
but thanks for the help !
and just to be clear , i know i &apos;m yelling ,
but i &apos;m actually very appreciative !
while i was learning to dance ,
my dad was ready to do some teaching of his own .
what are you doing ?
eating boo berry .
good for you .
very smart .
feed your body .
so , your mom found out
that i never got around to giving you the talk .
what talk ?
the ... &quot; people making people &quot; talk .
ohh , that talk !
exactly !
so , if she asks , tell her we just had it .
but we didn &apos;t .
we don &apos;t need to .
i mean , you &apos;re a grown man , and you know everything .
of course !
yeah !
i do have one question .
is it true you can get a girl pregnant
if you french kiss her after midnight ?
what are you talking about ?
like in the movie &quot; gremlins . &quot;
if you kiss after midnight , the saliva goes into her tummy ,
and &apos; cause of her hormones and the moon ,
six weeks later , a baby comes out .
gremlins ?
you think -- how could you even --
where are you going ?
i got to regroup ! i wasn &apos;t prepared for this !
i need to prepare .
turns out , my dad &apos;s world wasn &apos;t the only one caving in .
do you want the rad news or the totally rad news ?
don &apos;t say &quot; rad . &quot;
i got these on sale and thought
they &apos;d be perfect to wear to the dance .
you like &apos; em ?
they made a parachute into clothing !
damn right , i like &apos; em !
and the even better news is
i will be joining you at the dance !
what ? !
i know !
i signed up to be a chaperone .
that way , i &apos;ll be there to help with your moves .
i don &apos;t need help . don &apos;t help me .
all kids are embarrassed by their parents .
but don &apos;t think of me as your mom .
think of me as your coach .
i don &apos;t want to think of you at all
when i &apos;m dancing with dana .
you won &apos;t even know i &apos;m there .
and if i &apos;m lucky , i &apos;ll get to see
my little baby have his first slow dance !
i &apos;d done the unthinkable .
i opened the door , and my mom had burst right through it !
what did he say ?
have you lost your mind ? !
i slow @-@ danced with mom !
what ?
you heard me .
what do you mean ? what are you saying ?
i ... slow @-@ danced ... with mom .
you slow @-@ danced with mom ?
this doesn &apos;t concern you !
the hell it doesn &apos;t !
you can &apos;t go slow @-@ dancing with mom
and not expect me to have lots of opinions
on this controversial matter .
it was a moment of weakness , and she taught me how to dance ,
and now she &apos;s gonna be a chaperone tonight
and totally humiliate me !
now you &apos;ve opened the door .
i know .
just tell me how to close it .
there is no way !
once the door &apos;s open , it stays open forever !
i sent her a letter from camp saying i was homesick .
and the next night , she showed up in the top bunk .
look , this is a picture of us in a canoe together !
never again , adam . never again !
this is all so upsetting .
i got to go . i can &apos;t be here .
okay . there &apos;s got to be a way out of this .
yes ! lies and deception -- that &apos;s your department .
i &apos;ll think of something -- i promise .
i love you .
don &apos;t say that .
look into my eyes and know that i ... love ... you .
get out !
love you !
again with the boo berry .
you know it .
all right .
here we go . time for the talk .
all right , before we get down to the nuts and bolts ...
nuts .
all right , instead of talking about
male and female body parts , we &apos;re gonna use the names
of our favorite baseball players as code words .
look , you have a mike schmidt .
ladies have a wade boggs .
and ... why are we doing this ?
this way , we won &apos;t be talking about anything horrible .
we &apos;re just gonna be talking about baseball --
like , when a man loves a woman ,
mike schmidt steps up to the plate against wade boggs .
wade boggs plays third . why is he pitching ?
fine ! wade boggs is now steve carlton .
steve ? that &apos;s clearly a dude &apos;s name .
okay , the girl &apos;s parts are gonna be , uh , bo jackson .
that makes no sense .
bo &apos;s a girl &apos;s name !
it &apos;s wintertime .
that &apos;s when bo jackson plays football .
he &apos;d never be on the same field as mike schmidt .
i never thought that i would ever say this to you ,
but you &apos;re over @-@ thinking this , you moron .
i &apos;m a moron ?
well , you &apos;re a mike schmidt !
take that back !
never !
get your head out of your orel hershiser
and come back here right now !
for what it &apos;s worth ,
i found that whole baseball thing very confusing .
that bad , huh ?
it was bad .
what kind of 16 @-@ year @-@ old boy doesn &apos;t even know
the basics of the birds and the bees ?
murray , he knows everything .
i gave him the talk three years ago when you dropped the ball .
he &apos;s just messing with you .
so he wants a sex talk , huh ?
well , i &apos;m gonna give him a sex talk , but good .
or , instead of trying to spite him ,
you actually have a real conversation about it ,
which would mean the world to him .
no , i &apos;m gonna go with my thing .
as my dad was putting his plan into motion ,
i was praying erica was , as well .
oh , balls .
hey , boopie . look what mama bought .
now we &apos;re parachute pals .
no ! that &apos;s not a thing . take &apos; em off .
i paid for the pants .
don &apos;t wear the pants .
i &apos;m wearing the pants .
don &apos;t wear the pants .
hey , mom ?
oh , look , it &apos;s erica .
check out this box of old photos that i found in the basement .
man , such good memories .
we should , like , organize these in some sort of way .
maybe in , like , a book ? that would be fun .
holy erica .
i have been begging you
to make a scrapbook with me for years !
well , let &apos;s make it right now .
oh , now ?
god , no . i &apos;ve got to chaperone adam &apos;s dance tonight .
tomorrow morning , we &apos;ll wake up at dawn
and really hit it hard .
what do you say ?
eh ... i &apos;m kind of losing interest .
oh , no , no . don &apos;t lose interest .
um ... i can do both .
adam , i &apos;ll meet you at the dance .
erica , don &apos;t move .
i &apos;m just gonna run upstairs and get my smock and glue gun .
there &apos;s 1,000 pictures in this box .
there &apos;s no way she &apos;s gonna make it to that dance .
have i mentioned that i love you ?
say it one more time , and i won &apos;t help you .
erica had actually pulled it off .
my mom was gonna be stuck home all night !
all right , got our cocoa .
let &apos;s cozy up and spend the next few hours
reliving my entire life .
and ... done !
what ? how did you do this ?
please , i &apos;ve had this whole thing
mapped out in my mind for years .
you ... pressed flowers ...
and put my favorite music lyrics beneath each photo .
take some time with it .
it &apos;s like a beautiful kaleidoscope of my life .
yeah , touching stuff .
now , i &apos;ve got to get to that dance .
the jam &apos;s not gonna pump itself up .
while erica &apos;s plan had failed ,
my dad was giving his one more shot .
hey , uh , bar , you got a sec ?
i think we should have a talk , man to man .
really ? okay .
i &apos;ve never been a great communicator ,
so i think i should keep things as direct and exact as possible .
all right .
so , we &apos;re not just gonna have the talk .
we &apos;re gonna experience the talk .
we &apos;re gonna do some role @-@ playing .
i &apos;m gonna be the girl . you &apos;ll be the boy .
and we &apos;re gonna learn where babies come from with our hands .
take a fraggle .
i don &apos;t want the fraggle .
i &apos;m a pretty fraggle girl .
would you like to come up to my condo for a nightcap ?
i &apos;ve been so lonely since i put myself through nursing school .
fraggles don &apos;t own condos !
take it . put your hand in the fraggle .
keep the fraggle away from me !
take it now !
stop it ! i was messing with you !
i know everything , okay ?
i know you know everything .
then why are you torturing me ?
because you tortured me !
what kind of moron makes their dad
give them the talk when they don &apos;t need the talk ?
who does that ?
me .
and you know why ?
&apos;cause you couldn &apos;t be bothered
to have the talk when i actually needed it .
dads are supposed to teach their kids stuff --
how to throw a fastball and change a tire and shave .
you never taught me anything .
in my defense , i @-@ i @-@ i know very little .
and fraggles -- they can &apos;t be nurses .
they dance their cares away .
as my dad was striking out at home ,
i was ready to hit the dance floor at school .
the only problem was that at a junior @-@ high dance ,
kids don &apos;t dance , but that didn &apos;t matter .
with my mom distracted by erica at home ,
it was time for me to show dana my awesome moves .
may i have this dance ?
kidding -- i &apos;m just here to chaperone .
unless you &apos;re bored . then let &apos;s boogie .
what are you doing here ? !
i told you i &apos;d make it .
now i &apos;m gonna need you to leave .
will you stop with that ?
i really want to be here at this dance .
you can &apos;t deny me that pleasure , adam .
go away !
but you &apos;re the one who asked me to teach you how to dance .
it was a mistake .
i asked for your help in a moment of weakness .
it &apos;ll never happen again .
okay . i guess i &apos;ll just go then .
the sound of those swishing parachute pants running away
was the sound of victory .
so , then , why did i feel so bad ?
even though i was forced
to hurt my mom in the name of love ,
i had to forge on .
i &apos;d charm dana with a cup of hawaiian punch
and then make my move .
dana . hey .
want some punch ?
no , i &apos;m just gonna go
hang outside until my mom dances herself out .
i didn &apos;t know your mom was a chaperone .
yeah , and she went out for margaritas
with the other moms before the dance .
it &apos;s so humiliating .
turns out , my mom was right about one thing --
every kid is embarrassed by their parents .
mom !
and it gave me an idea .
mom !
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m just leaving .
no . i need your help .
oh , no . you don &apos;t get my help .
not after you said you &apos;re never gonna ask for it again .
that &apos;s not how this works .
i &apos;m sorry , okay ?
sometimes , i need your help .
but sometimes , i just want you gone .
well , that &apos;s confusing !
i know . it makes no sense .
but for now , that &apos;s just how it &apos;s gonna be .
so , what do you want ?
i want you to go on that dance floor
and just ... be yourself .
i can do that .
well , what do you know ?
no one &apos;s looking at your mom anymore .
did you do that for me ?
well , i definitely didn &apos;t do it for me .
my plan had worked .
i &apos;d saved dana ,
but i couldn &apos;t have predicted what happened next .
my mom actually got
junior @-@ high @-@ school kids to dance ...
and it was epic .
come on ! i like the fast ones !
you know what ? i &apos;m gonna go out
and get some fresh air . why don &apos;t you come with me ?
have fun , baby .
normally , we don &apos;t say &quot; i love you &quot; in our family .
luckily for me , my mom could read lips .
want some company ?
i am a terrible father .
i &apos;ll take that as a yes .
i don &apos;t even know how to talk to my kids .
i &apos;m aware .
i always thought that i would do
everything different than my dad did .
and look at me -- i &apos;m just like him .
murray , you &apos;re nothing like him .
what are you talking about ?
we both look alike .
we both scream all the time .
we both walk around in our underwear .
but your dad would never
be out here right now , feeling like this .
and that &apos;s why you &apos;re different .
as for my dad , he &apos;d never be a good communicator .
damn it !
has anyone seen the bottle opener ?
but he was still able to teach yoa few things .
here . let me show you something .
little party trick . the ladies love it .
not bad .
don &apos;t just stand there .
go get another one , and i &apos;ll show you how .
that night , i learned that some events
can &apos;t be captured in a scrapbook .
you just got to be there and witness them yourself .
mrs. goldberg .
mrs. goldberg !
it &apos;s time to go home .
mm , dances don &apos;t really end ,
and the invitation for this one said ,
&quot; 6 : 00 to question mark , &quot; so ...
that was a 9 .
okay , well , that was just rude .
