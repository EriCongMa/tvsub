magnificent light
your life is about to end .
you will all die .
in your remaining time on earth ,
how do you want to live ?
as a bright and shining star ?
or as a lost soul passing time ?
do you want to live in darkness
or reveal your magnificent light ? !
today you will all be reborn as your true selves .
we are all born with a unique gift .
and your only job here on earth--
your only job--
is to share that gift .
only then , only when we have shed
our magnificent light on this world ,
will we experience real purpose ,
real fulfillment , and real joy .
let me tell you something about myself .
i spent 12 years of my adult life absolutely miserable
because i did not use my gift .
how many of you are living false lives ?
maybe you &apos;re an accountant .
but somewhere in the dark recesses of your mind ,
there &apos;s a tickle .
and that tickle is a reminder of your gift .
maybe it &apos;s a love for painting .
a love that you have had
since before you could even talk .
isn &apos;t that right , cynthia strobl ?
you could be the next picasso .
why have you deprived the world of your gift ?
and what about you , ralph pritchard ?
do you really want to
listen to your insufferable boss another day ,
or are you ready to
start that business you &apos;ve been dreaming of ?
isn &apos;t it time for you to
unveil your gift and take action ? !
right here , right now , that &apos;s what we &apos;re gonna do .
let &apos;s get started !
i still can &apos;t believe this .
i never , not in a million years ,
thought i &apos;d ever get to meet you in person .
and then you called my name and--
cynthia .
the pleasure has been all mine .
now do me a favor .
go out into the world and show them your gift .
oh , i will . i promise you .
goodbye , cynthia .
that was the last one @-@ on @-@ one , barry .
there &apos;s some more folks waiting for autographs .
not now .
i need my private time .
when will you be back ?
ok . whatever you want , barry .
sorry , folks , uh , mr. flynn is late for a meeting .
so take that first step now .
be ready for resistance .
others will try to stop you .
don &apos;t let them .
don &apos;t permit them to discourage you .
don &apos;t allow them to stand in your way .
tell them to trust you and glorious things will come .
oh , my god , what are you--
&quot; derek , would you do me a favor
&quot; and say a few words at the shindig ?
&quot; the honor of your presence has been requested
&quot; by her majesty &apos;s ambassador in bestowing
jason a. ryder the title of honorary commander
of the most excellent order &quot; --
this is from the british embassy .
garcia , do you mind ?
i &apos;m sorry . i don &apos;t know what came over me .
i saw the fancy invitation and i couldn &apos;t help myself .
we never get glamour here .
it &apos;s like shoeboxes to a hoarder .
well , you can just forget about it .
why ?
&apos;cause i &apos;m not going .
but isn &apos;t jason an old friend of yours ?
i &apos;ve heard his name before .
and who &apos;s gonna give the speech if you don &apos;t ?
i don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s not going to be me .
we love the british , remember ?
can we just drop this ?
i can go with you .
nobody is going .
i &apos;ll wear my contacts .
what &apos;d i say ?
who do i wear my contacts for ?
two people have been brutally stabbed in seattle
in the last two days .
lincoln bell , 28 , he was found on friday night .
and then cynthia strobl , 42,
her body was found last night .
both of them were killed in their own apartments .
police are sure it &apos;s the same killer ?
yes , because the same message was left behind .
&quot; hear your evil , see your evil . &quot;
isn &apos;t the phrase supposed to be &quot; see no evil , hear no evil &quot; ?
yeah , it certainly changes the meaning ,
which is supposed to be about remaining virtuous
even when you &apos;re surrounded by evil .
well , the question is , did the killer just get the phrase wrong ,
or was he trying to send a completely different message ?
the killer could have been a non @-@ native @-@ english speaker .
but this syntax doesn &apos;t help identify his first language .
and the other question is , who is this message for ?
is it a taunt to the police ?
it could be used to justify the murders .
you know , if you take the words literally ,
it sounds like he &apos;s speaking directly to the victims .
was the message written with the victims &apos; blood ?
the lab results aren &apos;t back yet .
are there any witnesses ?
it doesn &apos;t look that way .
which means the entry to the apartments
was planned and methodical ,
but the actually killings seem chaotic and disorganized .
maybe the unsub knew them
and took the time to plan his break @-@ in ,
but once he got close ,
his rage took over and he snapped .
you know , one thing &apos;s for sure . with at least 30 stab wounds
to each victim , this unsub sure has a lot of anger .
we need more answers .
let &apos;s head to seattle .
oh , my god , what are you--aah !
&quot; a great deal of talent is lost to the world
for the want of a little courage . &quot;
sydney smith .
there &apos;s doesn &apos;t seem to be a connection between the two victims .
different gender , race , age .
and they lived in different parts of the city .
yeah . lincoln bell worked in ticket sales
at el portal auditorium for the last 3 years .
cynthia strobl was an accountant .
she moved to seattle a year ago .
it &apos;s unlikely they would have ever crossed paths .
unless cynthia bought a ticket from him at one point .
according to his mother , lincoln &apos;s dream was to be an architect .
if he wasn &apos;t working , he was studying .
and cynthia liked big band music and lectures at the museum ,
so the one thing they did have in common
was very low @-@ risk lifestyles .
ok , i &apos;ve confirmed that cynthia lived in a security complex ,
the kind you need a special key fob to get in .
and lincoln was living in a studio apartment at the top floor
of a 6 @-@ story walkup .
so the unsub had the intelligence and the patience
to get past the security entrance .
he either used a ruse
or he blended in with the other residents .
and he had to be in good physical shape to kill lincoln bell .
so , he bypassed easier victims
and potential witnesses
to commit these murders .
he was mission oriented .
someone went out of their way to target these two people .
yeah , look at these crime scene photos .
there &apos;s not a hint of remorse .
this unsub was determined and relentless ,
like he couldn &apos;t kill these victims enough .
and the different typology
means they weren &apos;t surrogates for anyone .
so each victim probably did
something separately to incite the unsub &apos;s rage .
but it must have been the same trigger that set him off ,
because the murders were so similar .
so , they had something in common
outside of low @-@ risk lifestyles .
we need a point of convergence ,
either a person or a place
between the unsub and these two victims .
cause of death was massive hemorrhage .
both the carotid and the femoral arteries
were severed , in addition to the other stab wounds .
there &apos;s no signs of any other injuries or of sexual assault .
were the arteries cut first ?
it &apos;s hard to say , but it &apos;s very likely .
the first victim , lincoln bell ,
he had the same targeted lacerations to those arteries .
the other stab wounds , they seem more random .
so the unsub knew the best way to kill them ,
but he stabbed them multiple times afterwards
to express his rage .
there &apos;s also something else that &apos;s unusual .
these stab wounds have a curvature to them .
they weren &apos;t made with an ordinary straight blade .
what sort of knife did he use ?
based on my measurements , they were curved ,
sort of like a half circle .
like a mezzaluna .
does a mezzaluna look like this ?
not exactly .
the knife that made these wounds
probably had a vertical handle at least 6 inches long
in order to get the leverage for the depth .
you know , it looks like a ceremonial weapon of some sort .
i agree .
these killings could be sacrificial .
agent hotchner .
yes , sir .
detective harrison chen .
thanks for coming out .
this is agent blake .
pleasure .
lab results are back .
it &apos;s not blood on the walls .
killer used a red paint
that &apos;s widely available in hardware stores .
paint belong to the victim ?
nothing turned up in our initial search , so ...
if the unsub brought the paint with him ,
that means the message was also premeditated .
it could be a forensic countermeasure ,
like the messages in the macdonald case .
dr. jeffery macdonald was convicted
of murdering his family .
supposedly he left messages to convince authorities
that hippies had done it .
uh , we spoke to the neighbors .
apparently cynthia was gone all evening .
no one knows where she was or when she came home .
seems she &apos;s quiet , kept to herself .
the unsub could have followed her home
or been waiting for her here .
hotch , take a look at this .
the cd player was left on .
you are about to embark on the greatest adventure known to man .
that adventure is your own life .
she was there before she was murdered .
仅此一周
so where is mr. flynn now ?
you haven &apos;t told me what this is about yet .
check the vari @-@ lights . there was a weird shadow last night .
we need information about these people . do you recognize them ?
not him .
but her , yeah . she was at the show last night .
she was one of the guests
that got a one @-@ on @-@ one with barry afterwards .
and how would someone get that ?
people who buy advance tickets fill out a questionnaire .
barry randomly selects 5
and mentions them by name during the show .
it &apos;s pretty mind @-@ blowing to the people who are picked .
we can imagine .
tell me , what goes on during one of these one @-@ on @-@ ones ?
just mini life @-@ coaching sessions .
it &apos;s only about 15 minutes ,
but people come out transformed .
and did cynthia look transformed ?
probably . but i didn &apos;t actually see her .
she was barry &apos;s last client .
he showed her out himself .
flynn was probably the last person to see her alive .
wait--she &apos;s dead ?
she was murdered .
so let me ask you again ,
where &apos;s barry flynn ?
i don &apos;t know .
he needs private time
to rest and focus his mind .
it &apos;s part of his routine on show days .
but you &apos;re his manager . you can &apos;t get ahold of him ?
sorry . to make sure he &apos;s not interrupted ,
no one knows where he goes .
not me . not his family .
not anyone .
it &apos;s always been like that .
well , if you had to take a guess ,
where do you think he &apos;d be ?
he books a hotel room or an apartment in every tour city .
he &apos;s probably there .
he &apos;s always back in time for the show .
what time did barry leave ?
last night ,
it was a little later than usual .
want some company ?
sure .
i haven &apos;t seen you here before .
i &apos;m just visiting .
lucky you .
nice weather for a change .
i was hoping for rain .
more romantic .
i &apos;m ricky .
harold .
have you seen the sights ?
space needle , pike &apos;s place market , the aquarium ?
the first two , yes ,
the aquarium , no .
want a tour guide ?
why not ?
we confirmed flynn &apos;s been mia
since his private meeting with cynthia strobl ,
which officially makes him a suspect .
well , he &apos;s a point of convergence between the victims .
lincoln bell had a program
personally autographed by flynn in his apartment ,
so we know they met .
yeah . flynn was one of the last people ,
if not the last person to see cynthia strobl alive .
hey , garcia .
you &apos;re on speaker . what do you got ?
the 4 @-@ double @-@ 1 on barry flynn .
hey , has anyone been listening to this &quot; unlimited courage , &quot;
&apos;cause it &apos;s pretty amazing .
i &apos;ve just finished the first cd
and i &apos;ve already signed up for kickboxing class ,
and i painted a wall in my apartment white ,
which is a risky color in my world .
garcia .
oh , sorry . uh , well ,
barry flynn &apos;s is actually a stage name .
what &apos;s his real name ?
his real name is harold kerwin .
although he never legally changed it , though .
he was raised in reno , nevada .
he went to a 2 @-@ year community college .
he got married right after .
he has a couple of assault charges for some bar fights .
and then he worked for 12 years as a car salesman
before he left the rat race .
how so ?
he checked out , like quit his job ,
got a divorce , ran off to live in the desert .
came back 3 years later and he was barry flynn .
he started talking at schools and local clubs ,
built up this following , became sort of an overnight sensation .
within 3 years he was selling out 1,000 @-@ seat venues .
any idea what happened to him
in those 3 years while he was in the desert ?
well , according to flynn ,
he meditated a lot ,
until his true gift was revealed to him .
i hate to admit it , but it sounds pretty vague to me .
thanks .
never would &apos;ve guessed he had a prior assault conviction .
he could be our guy .
chen .
flynn had the means and the opportunity .
i &apos;m just not clear about the motive .
we all know that public figures like politicians
can have psychopathic tendencies and the ability to hide it .
but it doesn &apos;t make any sense
that he &apos;d kill his own paying customers .
and why start here , in seattle ?
why leave the bizarre message at the crime scenes ?
well , flynn &apos;s obviously a native english speaker ,
so , if he is the unsub ,
then the message could be indicative
of some sort of delusion or psychosis .
that is possible given the ceremonial knife that was used .
you know , no history of recent head trauma .
he &apos;s too old to have suffered a traditional schizophrenic break .
maybe a drug @-@ induced psychosis ?
no . flynn &apos;s clean as a whistle .
doesn &apos;t even eat dairy according to his bio .
well , as a celebrity , he has a vested interest in a clean image .
but who was he , really ?
flynn &apos;s rental car was just located outside a bar in alki .
how did you end up where you are today ?
was it a conscious choice ?
or does it feel like you had no control in the matter ?
you made me do this , barry flynn .
i guess we know how he was spending his &quot; private time . &quot;
too bad he couldn &apos;t be open about it .
he &apos;s probably afraid it would hurt his public image .
it &apos;s the same blood type as flynn &apos;s .
we &apos;re running a dna test .
we also found this .
it &apos;s a 100 @-@ decibel personal alarm .
flynn &apos;s manager said he always carried it with him ,
for protection .
flynn &apos;s not the unsub , he &apos;s a victim .
he felt threatened enough to be holding the alarm ,
dropped it when the unsub clocked him
and took him away in another vehicle .
no surveillance cameras .
guess the customers like their privacy .
so , what , did flynn meet the unsub in the bar ?
probably . no one inside noticed anything unusual ,
so they came out together voluntarily .
maybe flynn had a change of heart
and the unsub got angry .
we talked to the staff .
none of them remember even seeing flynn .
well , he &apos;d probably wear a disguise
if he wanted to be anonymous in public .
so the unsub didn &apos;t know who he was ?
maybe not .
but the m.o. is different here .
flynn wasn &apos;t blitz attacked at home like the others .
what if flynn was the ultimate target
and the others were used to get information on him ?
or maybe the other victims got in the way .
we could be looking at an extreme fan .
yes , someone could have followed him here .
most of the workers and stagehands in flynn &apos;s company are volunteers .
so he &apos;d be surrounded by fanatics .
he &apos;d be watching his every move .
well , let &apos;s just hope it was one of them who nabbed him .
why ?
because then there &apos;s a chance he &apos;s still alive .
the greatest gift is inside you already .
it &apos;s always been there , a constant companion .
when i heard that ,
i finally understood that i had to use my gift .
when i was a kid , i used to talk about it ,
until people said that i sounded weird .
and i hated it because it made me different .
and i tried to shut it off , but i didn &apos;t want to--
what did you do to me ?
you wouldn &apos;t come with me ,
and i had to do what i needed to do to get you to listen .
listen to what ?
4 months ago ,
i was fired . couldn &apos;t get another job .
i was an unemployed , middle @-@ aged loser
with no prospects .
i almost killed myself .
then i found you .
what &apos;s your name ?
carl .
carl finster .
carl , i can see that you &apos;re in pain .
i &apos;m not .
i feel alive .
like--like electricity is running through me .
can you take these off ?
i won &apos;t try to escape . i promise .
i &apos;m here for you .
you &apos;re lying .
i don &apos;t blame you .
i just need you to hear me out
until i know that you &apos;re convinced .
convinced of what ?
that i &apos;m your biggest success story .
while we initially thought barry flynn might be a suspect ,
it turns out we &apos;re looking for one of his followers .
an unsub who suffers from erotomania .
he &apos;s obsessed with flynn , his latest abductee ,
and he may believe that flynn &apos;s also in love with him .
erotomania has very little to do with sex .
it &apos;s a romantic or spiritual connection that erotomanics crave .
victims of the delusion tend to be from a higher social status
and have done very little to stimulate or encourage such a belief .
in fact , it &apos;s likely
the unsub and barry flynn have had no previous contact .
his infatuation probably began from afar ,
considering flynn &apos;s celebrity status .
the patience required to commit his crimes
makes us believe he &apos;s a male in his late 30s to 40s
who is single and socially immature .
he &apos;s a loner with poor social skills .
and although he is capable of holding down a job ,
he most likely neglects his duties to focus on his obsession .
this is a guy who spends much of his time
living in his delusional fantasy world .
and he may have been tracking flynn for quite some time .
and with erotomania ,
the most likely recipient of violence
is the person standing in the way of the desired object .
it &apos;s possible the unsub witnessed an interaction
between his two first victims and flynn ,
killing them in a jealous rage .
another possibility is that the unsub killed them
to prove his devotion .
the weapon used had a ceremonial quality to it .
which means the unsub probably
views these victims as sacrifices ,
and the messages he is leaving may be meant for flynn .
in his head , he may believe
that he &apos;s already involved in a personal relationship with flynn .
and now that flynn is under his control ,
this situation is especially precarious .
if the unsub is under the delusion
that flynn also cares about him ,
then any misstep by flynn
that contradicts that belief ,
could lead to more victims or even flynn &apos;s own murder ,
to prove they have a special bond .
with each passing hour ,
it &apos;s increasingly unlikely that flynn will be able
to match the unsub &apos;s expectations for him .
so we must act quickly .
thank you .
i &apos;ve ignored my gift for so long .
what is your gift ?
i don &apos;t hear things the way most people do .
i see it .
what does that mean ?
well , when people talk ,
i know the truth about them .
you know the truth .
like i knew you were lying when you said
you wouldn &apos;t try to escape .
a doctor told my parents
that there was a wire crossed in my brain .
it &apos;s harmless . kind of like a birthmark .
but thanks to you , i know he was wrong .
how so ?
because it &apos;s more than a birthmark .
i got this ability for a reason ,
and what i need to do is take action ,
and that &apos;s what you &apos;ve been telling me .
what are you planning to do , carl ?
let me show you .
we said that this unsub had poor social skills ,
so how did he lure flynn out of the bar ?
good question . maybe he had help
from someone with more charisma .
well , we should amend the profile , let the media know
that there may be a temporary partner involved .
all right , i &apos;ll call garcia
and get her to narrow the list of seminar attendees .
hey , baby girl .
if loving you is wrong , baby boy ,
i don &apos;t want to be right .
well , likewise , mama .
i need you to look into fans of barry flynn .
oh , i already have those numbers for you .
he has over two million fans worldwide ,
and the kind that are crazy infatuated with him ,
i would say about 100,000 .
hey , do you know that if
you join barry &apos;s official circle of friends ,
you get the &quot; unlimited courage &quot;
12 @-@ cd set for 49.99,
plus a free &quot; live or die , you choose &quot; mug .
come on , don &apos;t tell me you joined .
no . why would you say that ? i didn &apos;t--i didn &apos;t do that .
there &apos;s just things i need motivation for .
like i had that cupcake problem ,
and i really wanted to learn how to play the clarinet .
and barry flynn is a good guy who really helps people ,
and i want you to find him .
we &apos;re doing our best , girl .
by the way , totally different subject--
i happened upon
that invitation guest list for the british embassy thing .
did you know that madonna and stephen hawking are going ?
not together , but they &apos;re going .
penelope ...
seriously , you &apos;re gonna miss a chance
to meet stephen hawking ? reid will kill you .
well , then i &apos;m dead .
why don &apos;t you want to go ?
it &apos;s personal . how about that ?
oh , it &apos;s per-- oh , my god , it &apos;s personal ?
that never occurred to me that it would be personal .
i thought is was like stock market related or &apos; cause of the weather .
will you cut it out , already .
ok . keep your super secrets to yourself , 007 .
look , just do me a favor .
find out how many of flynn &apos;s uberfans live in seattle .
then i want you to narrow it down even more
by cross @-@ referencing with people with anger management issues .
yeah , derek--
thank you and goodbye , garcia .
hello ?
what are you doing here , carl ?
uh , i was missing a personal photo .
thought maybe i left it here .
your cubicle was cleaned out when you were fired .
what do you really want ?
you made a big mistake when you fired me .
i mean--i don &apos;t have a gun , it that &apos;s what you &apos;re worried about .
and i just wondered why you did it .
oh , come on , you know why .
i was getting complaints about you .
customers are never happy .
you yelled at them .
and you scared your co @-@ workers .
they thought you were seeing things half the time .
just like you are now .
what are you even looking at ?
it &apos;s unsettling .
we were worried about you .
it &apos;s not that you &apos;re a bad person ,
but this just isn &apos;t the right place for you , carl .
i &apos;m sure there &apos;s another job you &apos;d be much happier doing .
you &apos;ve always been envious of me , haven &apos;t you ?
i threaten you in some way .
ok , whatever .
look , you &apos;re gonna have to go .
he came forward when he saw our statement to the media .
someone paid him 200 bucks to bring barry flynn out of the bar
into the parking lot .
what happened in the parking lot ?
i don &apos;t know . i told flynn to wait for me ,
that i left my keys in the bar and that i &apos;d be right back .
was that part of the plan ?
yeah . but i never came back outside again , so--
now , you said the guy that paid you was a little weird .
how so ?
he couldn &apos;t look at me when he talked ,
and he kept yapping about a magnificent light .
i got &apos; em .
ha . transcripts of the calls i handled
and the customers &apos; addresses .
let me go .
you gotta let me go , carl .
oh , no , no , no . no , we &apos;re just getting started .
do you remember how i said how i felt alive ,
like electricity was coursing through me ?
well , i felt this way once before when i was 10 .
i had this dream that i was a superhero ,
and i had this partner ,
and together we killed evil people with this powerful knife .
well , i &apos;m going to kill these evil people .
help ! somebody , help !
aah ! damn it !
why do you keep resisting me ? !
you awoke this gift in me .
you of all people should understand
that we have to do this mission together .
why was there so much overkill on the two victims ?
they were threats to the unsub &apos;s
imaginary relationship with flynn .
they hardly knew flynn .
i mean , at least 4 other people had private meetings with him .
he gave autographs to at least a dozen others .
why those two ?
well , it &apos;s not reality based .
his delusional mind exaggerated
the relationships they had with flynn .
maybe he &apos;s not driven by jealousy .
what if the overkill was to make doubly sure that they were dead
and couldn &apos;t come back to life ?
the way you &apos;d want to kill a monster in a horror movie .
exactly . maybe he saw them as evil .
that could explain the messages on the wall .
where are we ?
janet dodd &apos;s house .
she &apos;s evil and we need to stop her .
carl , you &apos;re making a big mistake .
i &apos;m just doing what you told me to . i &apos;m taking action .
you misunderstood me .
now stop this before it &apos;s too late .
you do not want blood on your hands .
what &apos;s so funny ? !
you are . i &apos;ve already killed two already .
it &apos;s been in the news .
ok , she &apos;s alone now .
tell the police if you think she &apos;s evil .
no , no , no . the police won &apos;t do a damn thing .
no , i was in a bar once
and i saw a guy who was the epitome of evil ,
and i called the police to tell them ,
and they hung up on me .
and then 6 hours later , a mother and her baby
were killed when someone tried to carjack them .
and i know it was him .
i could have saved them .
don &apos;t worry . you just watch .
ready ?
no !
&quot; hear your red , see your red . &quot;
well , somehow it makes sense to him .
the unsub is clearly devolving .
yeah , the letters are shakier .
this message is less controlled than the others .
i agree . the word &quot; evil &quot; was replaced by &quot; red , &quot;
which means &quot; red &quot; could have been from his unconscious ,
a freudian slip , so to speak .
but what does it mean ?
is it something specific to this victim ?
janet dodd . got divorced two years ago ,
she lived here alone , worked as a paralegal .
any known enemies ? perhaps the ex @-@ husband ?
uh , not according to her sister .
the husband left janet .
any connection to flynn ?
doesn &apos;t seem to be . in fact her sister
was trying to get her to move on with her life ,
but janet seemed completely unmotivated .
the unsub didn &apos;t pick her
because of her connection to flynn , then .
then why did he choose her ?
somehow their paths must have crossed .
well , she didn &apos;t get out much .
only went to work and then back home .
we &apos;re pulling her phone records ,
see who she talked to last .
she &apos;s got a lot of overdue bills .
uh , yeah , her sister said she was struggling financially .
she cut up a credit card that wasn &apos;t expired . why ?
people often do when they &apos;re trying to rein in their spending .
psychologically it &apos;s harder to part with cash .
the phone logs .
a lot of calls recently to the same 800 number .
welcome to luxor bank cards .
hey , watch it , ese .
what &apos;s your problem , man ?
you blind or something ?
you &apos;re lucky i &apos;m busy today .
ok .
there we go .
there . take a sip .
come on .
no .
come on , you &apos;ll feel better . come on .
what do you want with me , carl ?
isn &apos;t it obvious ?
we &apos;re partners .
we &apos;re destined to fight evil together .
we &apos;re not p ...
when does the mission end ?
never .
this is only the beginning .
i don &apos;t think i realized how serious you were , carl .
you really want to change the world , don &apos;t you ?
you have the conviction of a superhero .
i believe that now .
come on , uncuff me .
i won &apos;t run . i promise .
when we got to our next target .
i knew you &apos;d come around .
go ahead , garcia .
ok , so i cross @-@ referenced barry flynn fans
with people who had anger management issues
and luxor bank , got one hit .
carl finster . he worked as a customer service rep
at the call center there .
he was fired 4 months ago .
what are the chances that he spoke to janet dodd on the phone ?
oh , the chances are 100 % ,
because she called that center
at least 20 times in the last year ,
and carl answered at least 3 of those calls .
what was the anger management issue ?
oh , apparently one of his co @-@ workers filed a complaint
after carl got super mad at her over god knows what
and threatened her but good .
he was fired a month later .
i am sending you his address now .
ok , so getting fired was his stressor ,
and barry flynn &apos;s seminar was his trigger somehow .
if he &apos;s stalking credit card customers ,
we need to find out who he spoke to .
a good point . take blake and reid and go to the workplace .
the rest of us will go to the house . let &apos;s go .
some of his co @-@ workers thought he was mentally ill .
when someone suggested he get help ,
he went off ,
practically threatened to kill her .
what did you think ?
something wasn &apos;t right .
i mean , you &apos;d be talking to him
and he wouldn &apos;t even be looking at you .
he &apos;d be looking around you .
was it like he was hallucinating ?
yeah . he started getting weird with the customers
and going off script , and , you know ,
i had to fire him .
going off script in what ways ?
we have a set algorithm of questions
depending on what the customer &apos;s calling about .
we review transcripts regularly ,
and carl was perfectly fine with some customers .
but with others , he &apos;d be verbally abusive for no reason .
clear .
it &apos;s clear !
there &apos;s nobody here .
guys , look at this knife .
is this who carl finster thinks he is ?
why does my card keep getting rejected ?
i &apos;ve been paying the minimum balance on time .
you were 5 days late in your april payment ,
so you &apos;re a liar .
what ? did you just call me a liar ?
i know who you are , howard jephson .
i can see your words .
ok , you know what ? i want to talk to your supervisor .
you are rotten to the core !
you don &apos;t deserve any more credit !
see what i was dealing with ?
carl was attacking certain customers for no reason .
why did he come back last night ?
well , at first i thought he came here to shoot up the place .
but now i think it was to steal the recordings of his calls .
we confirmed he downloaded a file .
wait a minute , guys .
he told the caller he could see his words .
and you said he acted like he was hallucinating ?
i think i might know what &apos;s wrong with him .
he has synesthesia .
it &apos;s a neurological phenomenon
in which two or more senses are triggered simultaneously .
for instance , someone might associate specific numbers with colors
or even be able to taste music .
i think carl has the form of synesthesia
in which he can literally see the words that people are speaking .
hence the message he left
&quot; hear your evil , see your evil . &quot;
it looks like he transcribed conversations
he had with people in different colors of ink .
green , orange , red .
well , these are not happy conversations .
reid , we can see here that each of the colors
mean something different to him .
white words mean the speaker is good .
it looks like the orange ink means the speaker &apos;s a liar .
you know , maybe he sees people &apos;s word in different colors
depending on what type of person he thinks they are .
what &apos;s the content of the red ones ?
oh , they &apos;re angry . he accuses them of being evil .
and so he sees their words in red .
&quot; hear your red , see your red . &quot;
he might believe it &apos;s a super power .
it looks like he tried to stop the synesthesia
by wearing tinted glasses .
the fact is , we know his latest victim was
a customer he spoke to .
his old boss says he came in last night
and stole a copy of the recordings .
the only reason is
to compile a list of people he considers evil .
exactly . the hit list .
and he &apos;s got all their addresses and vital information .
get in the house , now .
oh , my god . you &apos;re the guy on the news .
do as he says .
get in the house !
shut up !
howard jephson , i know who you really are .
i &apos;m not howard jephson .
no games . not if you want your family to live .
i &apos;m telling you the truth . we &apos;re just renting the house .
my name is stephen caldwell .
we never even met howard .
we just saw his name on the lease agreement .
we made a mistake . let &apos;s go .
look , if you leave now , we won &apos;t call the police .
carl , what the hell !
he lied to us .
his words turned orange .
now , hand me the knife .
it &apos;s the wrong guy .
i said hand me the knife !
ok . give me the gun .
wait . say that again .
give me the gun .
he &apos;s got 150 names in the seattle area .
he could be going after any one of them .
garcia , any way to narrow it down to callers in the city ?
ok , that gives us 32 .
was janet dodd the first name alphabetically of those 32 ?
no , she was the ninth .
so he &apos;s not going alphabetically .
how else would you organize a hit list ?
maybe time a contact .
he started with the first person he spoke to .
no , because he talked to janet dodd
the last day he was employed .
he &apos;s going in reverse order .
the ones he talked to most recently would be freshest in his mind .
garcia , take the last callers and find out
which ones live closest to janet dodd .
ok , i got two names that are about the same distance from her .
ranga patel and howard jephson .
all right , you two take blake
and go to howard jephson .
the rest of us will go to the patel house .
how did you do that ?
do what ?
how did you hide your true nature for so long ?
enough , carl . listen to me .
listen to me carefully .
you are not a victim of circumstance .
you are a creature of free will .
take the right action .
let this family go .
no one goes anywhere .
i know that you don &apos;t feel in control right now .
you don &apos;t know how you ended up here ,
and it feels like there &apos;s no way out .
but there is a way out . i can help you .
you think i &apos;ll believe anything you say anymore ?
you and i have a special bond , carl .
i know this isn &apos;t you .
you don &apos;t know anything about me .
fbi ! drop it !
he &apos;s evil ! i can see it .
all right , come on , let &apos;s go .
we know what &apos;s going on , carl .
you &apos;ve had a special talent your whole life , haven &apos;t you ?
it &apos;s my gift .
barry flynn here unleashed that , carl .
how can you hurt a man who &apos;s given you so much ?
he changed !
i saw red .
what do you see when we speak ?
we know that you called the police last year ,
and you warned them about a man .
they ignored me .
they ignored me and then he killed
a mother and her baby .
it wasn &apos;t him .
the man you warned them about was questioned ,
but it wasn &apos;t him .
they found the real killer a week later
and he confessed .
carl , your gift is not reliable .
it &apos;s just a reflection on how you feel about other people ,
but , carl , it &apos;s not who they really are .
if you kill this man ,
you &apos;ll be destroying a magnificent light .
think about it .
put the weapons down .
&quot; the mystery of human existence
&quot; lies not in just staying alive ,
but in finding something to live for . &quot;
fyodor dostoevsky .
i encourage you not to be mad at me .
i did a little research about jason ryder ,
and i found out that
he was your father &apos;s old partner at the chicago p.d. ,
so i &apos;m assuming that there was some sort of falling out ?
no , garcia .
jason moved to new york after my father died .
he was a hero on 9 / 11 .
that &apos;s why he &apos;s being honored .
so what &apos;s the problem ?
years ago , i was supposed to talk about my father
at the fallen law enforcement memorial .
i got up to the podium , then i froze .
you had stage fright .
no . it wasn &apos;t that at all .
well , there &apos;s the obvious remedy ,
which is imagining the whole audience naked ,
but you could imagine a whole audience full of unsubs .
you &apos;re really good at talking down an unsub .
baby girl , it wasn &apos;t stage fright .
i wasn &apos;t ready to discuss my feelings about my father in public .
and you think talking about his partner
is going to bring up those feelings ?
how can i honor jason ryder
when i couldn &apos;t honor my own father ?
it &apos;s disrespectful .
ok , this is gonna start out sounding really harsh ,
but you need to get over it .
you need to let it go . that is so far past .
you &apos;ve gotta stop beating yourself up about this .
that &apos;s not gonna happen , is it ?
ok .
well , then this ,
this gift is totally pointless .
it &apos;s just some stuff from barry flynn .
i talked to him about your issue ,
and he gave you another incentive as a thank @-@ you .
you only have it for 24 hours .
so ...
a policeman pulled over a man ,
and he said to him , &quot; sir , your eyes look bloodshot .
have you been drinking ? &quot;
and that man replied ,
&quot; officer , your eyes look glazed .
have you been eating doughnuts ? &quot;
you see , that right there was the last joke
that my father ever told me before he died .
a special gift in my life
are the 11 years that i did have with him .
because as brief as they may have been ,
my dad gave me unconditional love .
he taught me a sense of duty .
and he gave me a reason to keep working hard .
because each and every day , i do all that i know how to do
to make my father proud .
now , my dad was taken from this world way too soon .
but if he wasn &apos;t , i wouldn &apos;t be the man that i am today .
now , you may be wondering
why i &apos;m talking about him here .
it &apos;s because my father ,
the man that i admire the most ...
looked up to mr. jason ryder , who we honor here tonight .
jason was the most important person in my father &apos;s life
outside of his family .
he was his partner and his best friend .
like my father , jason strived to be the best he could be .
he inspired me to be fearless
and to go out into the world and find my inner light .
and for that , jason , i am eternally grateful to you .
no , please . please don &apos;t . please don &apos;t ! please !
no , no , no !
no , please ! please don &apos;t !
