sorry , uh , what was i saying ?

i figured you &apos;d gone to a hotel , or ...
yeah , well , herman &apos;s been breathing down my neck day and night .
this is easier .
plus , where i sleep is no longer any of your concern .
i didn &apos;t kick you out . i never said that you had to go .
no , no , you just made it very clear
that my being around you was suffocating .
okay , well , have you told anyone ?
no . have you ?
no .
i -- do you think that we should ?
can we just not ... yet ?
whatever you want .
i didn &apos;t want any of this .
i have rounds .

yes . mr. weaver here is --
oh , jeremy . hi .
yeah , he &apos;s complaining of chest pains .
ekg is fine except for a little lvh ,
but his first troponin is within normal limits ,
so i &apos;ve ruled out a dissection ,
but his belly is still a little tender .
i &apos;m fine , really .
oh , well , let &apos;s see .
take it easy , mr. weaver .
okay , see you later .
okay .
hurts there ?
yeah , but it &apos;s -- it &apos;s heartburn , i swear .
my wife made me come .
i mean , i should be at work , you know ?
and i got to pick up my kid later .
uh , jeremy , have you eaten today ?
uh , coffee .
oh , you skipped breakfast , too , huh ?
uh , oh , no , no , no , and then , uh , pancakes ,
sausage , eggs , a couple of energy drinks .
i would &apos;ve had more ,
but i &apos;ve been having trouble swallowing lately .
sounds like you did pretty well .
well , you got to fuel up .
you know , i got a lot of balls in the air !
sorry . look , we &apos;re gonna admit you for observation .
no , no , no , no , no , no .
and i &apos;ll try to make it quick , okay ?

and an abdominal c.t.
uh , call me when you get the results .
finish your doughnut .
melissa works with us .
we do computer repair at office hub .
i found her on the way into work .
she was just laying there on the ground , not moving .
i thought she was dead !
do you know anything about her family , anyone we can contact ?
we don &apos;t really know her that well .
wilson !
uh , why don &apos;t you guys take a seat ? i &apos;ll be right back .
she &apos;s crashing .
you paged ortho ?
oh , whoa !
yeah , you &apos;re gonna have to wait .
belly &apos;s expanding even though i cross @-@ clamped the aorta .
should we book an o.r. ?
yeah , but she &apos;s not gonna make it to an o.r.
with this much blood in the belly .
we &apos;re gonna need to do an emergency laparotomy .
uh , right now ? here ?
wilson , we &apos;re gonna need gauze , laps ,
whatever we have to pack this abdomen .
you sure you want to do this ?
i &apos;m sure we don &apos;t have a choice .
okay .
all right , wilson . liver &apos;s intact .
let &apos;s look at the retroperitoneum .
oh , god , it &apos;s the i.v.c.
okay , put some pressure on it .
satinsky , please . suction ready .
all right , fracture &apos;s all cleaned out for now .
i &apos;ll do the repair tomorrow .
have we found out anything about this girl ?
no purse , no i.d.
and we know she worked at the office hub ,
but the only emergency contact they had was her own number .
actually , we know something else .
she &apos;s a veteran .
yeah , she has an operation iraqi freedom tattoo , 2011 @-@ 2012 .
i &apos;ve been examining a lot of vets lately , thanks to you .
good eye , torres .
the injury &apos;s exposed . 4 @-@ oh prolene .
this should never have happened to her .
it shouldn &apos;t have happened to anyone .
more suction , please .
hi , mom !
oh , look at -- oh , look at you !
how was your flight ?
oh , not as good as my ride over .
my chauffeur has the prettiest eyes .
mom !
oh , uh , thank you ?
oh , look , i almost forgot .
look what i found in the airport gift shop --
zoo animal decals from the seattle zoo !
i thought they &apos;d be adorable on the nursery wall ,
and they &apos;ll go with whatever color
you &apos;re planning on painting ,
which i assume is gender neutral .
oh , you know , actually , we haven &apos;t --
we haven &apos;t really had time to think about colors .
oh , you two and work -- busy , busy , busy !
speaking of which , um , the e.r. is a madhouse .
i @-@ i probably -- i just need to get back down there ,
but i promise i will try to make it back for dinner .
oh , dinner ?
mom .... what ?
i thought maybe you could take off the afternoon .
we could shop for paint samples for the nursery
and open a baby registry .
mrs. frye at church asks over --
mom , you know what i do for a living .
i don &apos;t know why you thought
i could just take all afternoon off to --
you know what ?
i have a super @-@ light day ,
so i can -- i can do all of -- all of those things .
jackson , you d-- you don &apos;t have to do that .
it &apos;s not a problem .
it &apos;ll be fun !
yes , it will .
we &apos;ve got this .
guys , i don &apos;t want to sound like a jerk ,
but i got clients to see all over town ,
and then i got to pick up my kid and drop her at volleyball ,
and then i got two more clients to see .
and believe me , i get it .
the number of things i &apos;ve got on my agenda
would make your head spin .
perfect ... then send me home , and we can both get back to it .
i mean , look at me . i &apos;m fit as a fiddle .
well , that &apos;s not what your labs say .
uh , cholesterol is in the 300s .
your triglycerides are worse .
your bp &apos;s too high , and your blood sugar
is in the pre @-@ diabetic range .
who are you gonna believe ... me or science ?
okay , you &apos;ve got an honest face ,
but science and i go way back .
c.t. doesn &apos;t show abdominal problems ,
but we &apos;d like to do some extensive studies .
so we need to do a barium swallow test .
when we get that back , depending on the results ,
i might need to do an e.g.d.
is there any way we could skip a step ,
you know , cut to the chase ?
okay , dr. bailey is just trying to avoid putting a tube down your throat
or up your ...
indeed .
you know , i appreciate the thought ,
but if it &apos;ll get me out of here sooner ,
dr. bailey can stick a tube wherever she wants .
all right .
this is waldo pfeiffer , gestational age 23 weeks .
in addition to an incredibly unfortunate first name ,
waldo &apos;s dealing with a particularly nasty c @-@ cam .
tell me what c @-@ cam stands for .
congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation .
the mass is pressing on his heart and lungs .
waldo &apos;s c @-@ cam has been unresponsive to steroid treatment .
now he &apos;s developing hydrops .
this is what fetal surgery was created for .
first , we &apos;re gonna open up the mother ,
then incise the uterus ,
then we &apos;re gonna remove the c @-@ cam
and put him right back where we found him ,
and hopefully he &apos;ll be carried to term .
you have a consultation in 20 minutes .
make it fast , get back here ,
and we &apos;re going to go over this procedure step by step .
terrific . thank you .
well , don &apos;t thank me .
i decided it was necessary
when it took you two months to wrap your head around
a fetal valvuloplasty .
you ready for this ?
yes . yes , absolutely .
uh , it &apos;s a chronic subdural . it should reabsorb itself .
great . thanks .
your wife invited me to dinner at your house .
perfect .
yeah , i was so surprised by the invitation ,
i forgot to ask if i should bring anything .
just yourself . anything you don &apos;t eat ?
no . not at all .
oh , perfect .
how about a pot roast ?
great .
uh , i &apos;m -- i &apos;m -- i &apos;m sorry .
uh , shepherd , i was looking for a consult .
i can come back later .
no , we &apos;re done here .
thanks , dr. shepherd .
richard .
what are you doing tomorrow night ?
hey , this could be you if you keep eating like you do .
i bet if we took your blood right now ...
mm @-@ hmm , see , i could say the same thing about you ,
but i wouldn &apos;t want to change a single thing about you ,
so i won &apos;t .
i don &apos;t want to change anything about you either .
i like you alive ,
not dead on a toilet after having a heart attack
trying to pass a deep @-@ fried onion blossom .
god , miranda , why would you even think ...
what the hell ?
oh , what is this ?
not a deep @-@ fried onion blossom &apos; cause that &apos;d just be too much .
no .
it &apos;s a tumor .
and it &apos;s a big one .
hey , sorry ,
the consultation went off without a hitch ,
but then mom got a little nervous ,
so i just wanted to make sure that she was okay .
c @-@ cam . um , i &apos;m ready whenever you are .
there &apos;s been a change in plans .
i &apos;m having a personal ...
i &apos;m going home .
here are the materials on the procedure .
internalize them .
i &apos;ve made notes in the margins because my approach is better
than most of the crap that &apos;s in there .
you &apos;ll also need to cover my service .
wait , hold on . is everything , uh , okay ?
i said it &apos;s personal !
you have what you need from me there .
read it .
what if i have questions ?
they &apos;ll be answered in there . i &apos;ll see you tomorrow .
i keep telling you to take more walks ,
yeah , you know , i mean , like , have a salad , maybe ,
instead of all the philly cheesesteaks .
you certainly do , honey , constantly ,
and just every time ... hello .
you don &apos;t look like you have good news .
jeremy
um , i &apos;m afraid the e.g.d. revealed a tumor .
it &apos;s early @-@ stage adenocarcinoma .
oh , god !
cancer ?
but i @-@ i @-@ i came in here for heartburn .
and that &apos;s most likely what you had , but the ...
cheesesteaks and the fried foods
have caused intense acid reflux , and over time ,
that reflux has made your esophagus
the perfect home for cancer .
i &apos;m sorry .
so , w @-@ what do we do ?
we &apos;d like to keep you overnight
and do some pre @-@ op tests ,
then do an esophagectomy where we remove your esophagus
and replace it with a piece of your colon .
and then the cancer would be gone ?
that &apos;s the hope .
yeah , it will be .
okay , it &apos;ll be fine .
you go and get erin .
yeah .
and tell her what &apos;s going on , but don &apos;t scare her , okay ?
it &apos;s gonna be fine .
okay .
it &apos;s gonna be fine .
hello , jackson ?
in here , dr. mom !
you &apos;ve been ... busy .
we were just gonna start a gift registry ,
but then we saw this adorable mobile ,
and the next thing i knew , i filled a shopping cart .
yeah , we actually had a pretty good day today .
don &apos;t sound so surprised ! i am quite fun .
uh , this didn &apos;t come from a store .
four generations of kepner babies
have slept in that old war @-@ horse .
how did you ...
you didn &apos;t bring this in your carry @-@ on .
shipping cost a fortune .
your sisters thought i should send it along ,
but i wanted to be here to see your face when it arrived ,
so last week , i called jackson .
you called jackson ? !
i do know how to use a telephone , little miss .
i am famished .
well , why did you wait for me to eat ?
i called . i told you i &apos;d be late .
we probably just lost track of time .
it &apos;s no a big deal .
i &apos;ll just hop in the kitchen and whip something up .
well , i didn &apos;t go to the store
because i thought that we would be going out .
i &apos;m sure i can figure something out .
no , no , mom , stop it !
i don &apos;t -- i don &apos;t need you to whip something up ,
and i didn &apos;t need you to come out here
and set up my whole nursery .
i don &apos;t need -- i -- i don &apos;t want your help !
do you understand ? !
april .
come on , that &apos;s not fair .
you invited richard to dinner ? !
this was already a bad idea .
you &apos;re trying to make it worse ?
she doesn &apos;t want to know him .
he said exactly the same thing .
okay , then why are you trying to force it ?
because he &apos;s my friend . he &apos;s our friend .
he &apos;s family , and this is one of the reasons
why you didn &apos;t want to leave seattle in the first place , remember ?
you have family here , roots .
are you kidding me ? !
what ?
i have to have dinner with the sister i don &apos;t know
and the bio @-@ dad she hates
because you gave up your chance to work for obama ? !
you &apos;re gonna play that card ?
of course you are because you &apos;ll be playing that card
until the end of freaking time !
time @-@ out .
no , i am so sick of your passive @-@ aggressive ...
time @-@ out . i &apos;m sorry .
i shouldn &apos;t have said that .
i am just trying to help out here .
i &apos;m trying to help you , and i am trying to help them .
i come from a big family .
it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s messy , but it &apos;s good ,
and i want that for you .
i want you to have that .
she &apos;s your sister ,
and he &apos;s practically your father .
and zola needs more black people in the family
because i &apos;m running out of ways to braid her hair
and bailey won &apos;t show me any more .
fine .
you want richard to come to dinner ,
call pierce and make sure she &apos;s okay with it .
me ?
you want richard to come to dinner .
you win . accept the win .
don &apos;t push for more .
okay , but s @-@ shouldn &apos;t you be the one who &apos;s making the --
accept the win .
i thought i was clear .
i don &apos;t need you up here double @-@ checking my work .
oh , don &apos;t get all sharks and jets on me , okay ?
one of herman &apos;s patients landed in here ,
and i &apos;m learning the steps
of tomorrow &apos;s c @-@ cam fetal surgery from a journal article .
actually , not even --
from the chicken scratch in the margin of an article .
i think she &apos;s trying to haze me
or set me up for a failure or , uh , maybe kill me .
you know what ?
no one forced you to do this , and now you &apos;re gonna pout
because it &apos;s kind of hard and your teacher &apos;s mean ?
suck it up .
melissa , it &apos;s okay . - what are -- what are you --
you &apos;re -- you &apos;re -- you &apos;re in the hospital .
you were -- - where &apos;s --
you were pretty badly banged up , but you &apos;re all right .
where &apos;s my car ? d @-@ did they --
it &apos;s -- - did they find my car ?
it &apos;s all right .
did they find my car ?
just try and sleep . okay ?
dr. bailey !
dr. pierce !
i didn &apos;t know you were a runner !
oh , yeah . i mean , i usually just spin .
i @-@ i take a spin class .
i thought i could get some fresh air for a change .
it &apos;s a gorgeous morning , isn &apos;t it ?
you know , i was only gonna go like another 3 miles ,
but i can stretch it out if you want to join .
oh , no . i mean , uh , thank you .
i -- i &apos;m sorry .
i just picked up a new audiobook .
oprah recommended it .
totally understand .
let me know how it is .
okay .
uh , you &apos;re the last person who gets to lecture me
on avoiding my mother .
that &apos;s not true .
my mother is a nightmare ,
and yours is the sweetest person i &apos;ve ever met .
no , what happened last night was not sweet .
it was condescending .
come on , you &apos;re overreacting .
yes , &apos; cause she just decided that i needed her help .
i needed help .
i asked her for it , okay ?
i have no idea what the hell i &apos;m doing here .
i just spent four hours in that baby store ,
and my mind was blown .
do you know how much i don &apos;t know about having babies ?
so much .
and she knows everything and so do you ,
and it &apos;s easy for you guys .
my family was not built that way .
i didn &apos;t have grandparents falling over themselves
trying to ... love me ,
but lucky for us , our kid will .
that is , provided that you do not drive her away first .
o.r. three is ready for melissa &apos;s tibia repair ,
and the police are finishing up getting her statement now .
all right , thank you , ma &apos;am .
melissa , are you okay ?
they found it .
they found my car
in pieces in some chop shop in bellevue ,
um , and it &apos;s gone .
okay . it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s all replaceable .
let &apos;s just be glad you didn &apos;t get killed .
damn it .
if i hadn &apos;t been asleep ...
what happened ? do you remember ?
i was sleeping ,
and then they broke the window ,
and they pulled me out of it , and ...
and i tried to hold on , but i got stuck in the door ,
and they dragged me for a while ,
and then they punched me , and then they kicked me , and ...
and then i couldn &apos;t hold on anymore .
god , why didn &apos;t you just let them take it ?
everything was in that car .
everything .
the car was the first thing she asked about when she woke up .
she said she was asleep in it when she was attacked .
it sounds like it &apos;s all she had .
so you &apos;re saying she &apos;s homeless ?
i &apos;m saying i think she &apos;s living in her car , so , yeah .
well , i thought you said she had a job .
no , you can have a job and not have a home .
that just makes it even worse .
i mean , try going through high school living in your car .
you got to lie all the time , you can never have anyone over ,
you have to make up excuses why , you have no bathroom ,
and then you know what ?
you can &apos;t even tell anybody
&apos;cause then they just look at you like you &apos;re weird and pitiful .
find me when she wakes up .
okay .
you lived in your car in high school ?
see , that &apos;s the look .
glove me .
karev ?
dr. karev expressed an interest
in our little c @-@ cam surgery today .
yeah , it sounds amazing ,
but i want to make sure i &apos;m not in the way .
happy to have you .
hope to hell you studied , robbins .
i &apos;ll warn you , i did not sleep well last night .
my patience will be thin .
richard webber is coming ?
no , that &apos;s --
i can &apos;t believe him .
no , no , no . it didn &apos;t come from richard , okay ?
i invited him .
well , i can &apos;t make it . i &apos;m sorry .
look , you came here to find out about ellis .
why don &apos;t you talk to someone who actually knew her ?
to richard .
come and have dinner with me and meredith .
less pressure -- it &apos;s a baby step .
let me think about it .
okay .
is this about how i &apos;m gonna pay for all this ?
no . no , no , no .
we just wanted to know --
&apos;cause i @-@ i have some insurance left ,
but all the paperwork was --
was inside your car ?
i &apos;m just saying that i &apos;ll figure it out .
melissa , are you living in your car ?
wilson .
i don &apos;t know how else to ask .
we don &apos;t mean to pry .
we just -- - i --
i @-@ it was only gonna be temporary .
i -- when i got out of the army ,
the job i had lined up was gone .
my fiance was gone , and ...
my apartment with him .
all i could get was the job at office hub ,
and it doesn &apos;t pay great , and i couldn &apos;t afford rent ,
so , yeah , i &apos;m making it work .
but now the car &apos;s gone with , uh , my cash
and my clothes , my savings
&apos;cause banks want you to have an address .
so , uh , yeah .
yeah .
i mean , everything i have is gone ,
but if i can &apos;t get back to work ,
then i &apos;m gonna lose my job , too .
melissa , there are programs available
for the sole purpose of helping ...
homeless veterans .
well , i &apos;m not homeless .
i &apos;m -- it &apos;s only temporary .
they will get you into real , dependable housing ,
then after that , everything else is that much easier .
see , that &apos;s -- that &apos;s not for me .
you served in iraq .
i fixed computers in an operations office
in the green zone .
there are guys who were wounded in combat ,
who were blown to pieces , who had their faces burned off ,
and i &apos;ve met guys who have been on the street since vietnam .
i was carjacked .
in seattle .
excuse me .
you have some visitors .
oh , my god , uh ...
just , uh , p @-@ please go ?
and don &apos;t say a word to those guys ?
melissa , - i -- i &apos;ll figure it out .
i always do .
just go , please .
okay , everybody , we &apos;re about to meet waldo .
let &apos;s be quiet so we don &apos;t wake him up .
robbins , next step ?
a 20 @-@ cc @-@ per @-@ kilo bolus of normal saline
into the umbilical vein .
so you did read my notes .
i &apos;ll give the bolus .
you pull out waldo &apos;s arm
so we can attach the monitor .
okay .
it &apos;s amazing .
indeed .
now you &apos;re ready for chest exposure and incision .
scalpel .
now , every step counts here .
tell me what you &apos;re about to do .
i &apos;ll perform a posterolateral thoracotomy
and slowly deliver the mass .
slowly and controlled .
i &apos;m sorry ?
my notes said
the mass needs to be delivered slowly
and in a controlled manner .
did you read my notes or not ?
i did . it also told me to prepare for bradycardia .
proceed .
okay . there &apos;s the mass .
and there &apos;s the bradycardia .
how do we handle that ?
atropine and epi i.m. into the deltoid .
and why is this important ? why this approach ?
&apos;cause if the c @-@ cam starts to pop out ,
then this little guy is at risk for heart failure .
that &apos;s not what my notes said .
well , not in those words , but --
i want my words . i want my exact words .
you &apos;re giving me the gist .
i &apos;m not interested in your interpretation of my notes .
i want to know that the specific words that i wrote
are now embedded in your brain .
that &apos;s what this is all about .
that &apos;s what this fellowship is all about .
if you &apos;re only interested in learning the gist of --
all right , she gets the point .
dr. karev ...
we &apos;re just getting to the good part .
you don &apos;t want to have to leave now .
my notes said that before my approach ,
this surgery resulted in fetal cardiac arrest
50 % of the time .
feels strange , doesn &apos;t it ?
to touch a baby before he &apos;s even born ?
you know what it feels like ?
privilege .
great privilege .
what happened ?
nothing .
did you fall ?
no !
i &apos;m fine .
you &apos;re not fine .
you &apos;re -- you &apos;re limping .
limping ?
i hope you didn &apos;t overdo it this morning .
overdo what ?
jogging .
jogging ?
yes , jogging .
she didn &apos;t tell you ?
we ran into each other at the seward park trail .
are we gonna go get a tumor out of a man
or just sit around and talk about it ?
okay . meredith .
did derek talk to you about me coming to this dinner ?
he did .
okay , what do you think ?
because i &apos;m not 100 % convinced .
i &apos;m not either .
i @-@ i think it might seem -- - a little pushy .
a little too much , too soon .
i &apos;m thinking of calling it off .
well , if you think that &apos;s best .
i think derek will understand .
what is wrong with you people ? !
you can &apos;t un @-@ invite someone to dinner ,
not after the song and dance i had to go through
to get her to even think about coming .
you &apos;re not calling this off !
okay , i have an aneurysm i need to clip .
i will see you both there tonight .
i &apos;ll bring dessert .
thanks . that would be nice .
edwards , start his work @-@ up .
i &apos;ll be there in a second .
copy that .
47 @-@ year @-@ old male . he was the passenger in a vehicle .
i thought your flight wasn &apos;t till later this afternoon .
i pushed it .
you owe me an apology .
and i &apos;m not leaving until i get one .
i owe you an apology ?
you were rude , and i raised you better .
i understand you &apos;re very busy ,
and i understand you work hard , but --
mom , i am not going to apologize
for having the life that i want , even if you think --
april kepner !
you have made choices that are very different from mine ,
and it &apos;s scary .
any mother who watches her child
do something she hasn &apos;t done herself --
it &apos;s scary .
but that doesn &apos;t mean i haven &apos;t been proud of you ,
and the more i see you in this world ,
in this work , in this marriage ...
the prouder i am .
i have no earthly understanding of what it is you do ,
but i know a lot about babies ,
and i don &apos;t want to take anything away from you .
i just want to help you .
and i get to do that because i am a grandma .
and i am also ... your mother .
i &apos;m sorry .
thank you .
so , can i ...
can i call you if i have questions ?
well ...
i suppose .
if you must .
thanks for having my back in there .
you can &apos;t let her talk to you like that .
i know .
well , so do something about it .
i can &apos;t .
well , you have to .
callie and i are splitting up .
and there are a lot of reasons why it happened ,
but taking this fellowship
might &apos;ve been the nail in the coffin .
i traded my marriage for this job ,
and it &apos;s pretty much all i have right now ,
so it has to work .
i need it to work .
okay .
no , screw that . it &apos;s not okay .
i saw what happened in there . she &apos;s got it in for you .
she &apos;s either looking for a reason to fire you ,
or she &apos;s gonna grind you down and make you miserable
trying to please her .
she &apos;ll probably fire you either way .
what do you got to lose ?
melissa ?
yeah ?
i brought these for you .
i told you i --
what rank were you when you got out ?
pfc .
well , i was a major ,
so you &apos;re gonna listen to me if for no other reason
than i outrank you .
but mostly because we have this in common .
i served , just like you .
i did two tours as a surgeon
with an army forward surgical team .
i gave what i had to offer .
so did you .
i patched up guys .
i can no more , you know , re @-@ jigger a hard drive --
reformat .
what ?
reformat a hard drive .
you gave what you had to give .
you served .
and you deserve all the help and gratitude
that &apos;s offered to you .
but if you think that by accepting this help
you &apos;re taking it away from the next guy ,
you are wrong .
but there are so many guys out there .
if you want to make sure these guys get help ,
i have friends at the v.a.
you can volunteer .
there &apos;s so much you can do ,
but to start , you have to get up on your own feet .
that is how you help .
that is how you serve .
understood ?
yes , sir .
starting the neck incision .
how old did this guy say he was again ?
42 .
he &apos;s got the esophagus of an 80 @-@ year @-@ old .
you went jogging ?
yes , i jogged --
half a mile , and now i can barely walk ,
and that &apos;s embarrassing enough
without you acting like i took a rocket to the moon !
you shouldn &apos;t be embarrassed .
i hope you don &apos;t give up .
the thing is , no matter when you start something like this ,
it &apos;s gonna be hard .
just , you have to start .
and take baby steps .
is that a short joke ?
b.p. &apos; s dropping . - what the --
that &apos;s a third @-@ degree a.v. block .
we need to try to pace him .
dr. bailey , can you --
no , i have his colon .
okay , hold it , hold it !
bring the crash cart over for temporary pacing .
too late -- he &apos;s coding .
crap -- v @-@ fib !
dr. warren , get the paddles and charge to 150 .
clear !
restart cpr .
push one of epi , push one of atropine !
hold compressions !
no , it &apos;s not too late .
oh , it can &apos;t be too late !
go again !
clear !
no . no .
we did everything we could .
go again .
clear .
jeremy died during surgery .
i &apos;m so sorry .
it was supposed to be heartburn .
it was just heartburn . it was supposed to be heartburn !
how could this happen ? !
how could this happen ? !
no ! no , no , no !
hey . you done soon ?
let &apos;s go home .
you mean , go to your house .
what ?
well , it &apos;s your house .
i just crash there , right ?
i mean , you never asked me to move in .
you never complained but never ...
did i do something ?
&apos;cause i feel like i &apos;m in trouble .
no , i &apos;m in trouble
&apos;cause when this changes i don &apos;t have anyplace to be .
god ...
i used to be so careful .
wait , um ...
what &apos;s changing ?
i @-@ i @-@ i thought we were good .
yes , but it all changes , alex .
it always does .
you can &apos;t hold on to anything that you don &apos;t want to lose .
right now , i feel like i have ...
a bed and a house .
and it is so good .
but my bed isn &apos;t my bed . it &apos;s your bed .
and i hate that i don &apos;t want to lose it .
look at me .
you got me .
i swear to god .
i &apos;m not going anywhere except home with you .
come on .
let &apos;s go home .
did you take the pot roast out of the oven ?
uh , i shut the oven off
because i don &apos;t want that thing to get cold .
i &apos;ll take it out .
really ?
you &apos;re not really a chef .
and you are ?
i &apos;m better than you .
why would you say something like that ?
because you called the pot roast a &quot; thing . &quot;
but it &apos;s not true .
you &apos;re not better than me .
have you ever cooked a meal before ?
okay , wait , time @-@ out .
well ?
well , what ?
you called a time @-@ out .
you have to say something when you call a time @-@ out .
that &apos;s how it out works . it is not a mute button .
it is right now .
that &apos;s not how it works .
i need a time @-@ out !
i need a break -- from you , from the fighting ,
from the pot roast because the table isn &apos;t set .
the candles aren &apos;t lit .
the guests are gonna arrive in 30 minutes .
i still need to take a shower . i need a time @-@ out !
don &apos;t look at me like that .
i could use a shower , too .
how &apos;s the baby book ?
it &apos;s the scariest thing i &apos;ve ever read .
i was a jerk today .
yeah , you were .
uh , so , this is the part where you say ,
&quot; no , you weren &apos;t the jerk . i was the jerk . &quot;
yeah , but i wasn &apos;t , and you were .
get up . i want to sit down .
okay .
right ?
you built this ?
twice , actually .
i &apos;m pretty sure there &apos;s something wrong
with the directions .
it &apos;s perfect .
you did a good job .
you &apos;re gonna be a great daddy .
thank you .
thank you .
i &apos;m dying . i &apos;m just gonna drop dead .
oh , we &apos;ve talked about you
reading horror stories before bed .
i don &apos;t want to get punched in the middle of the night
because you &apos;re having nightmares .
i ran my labs yesterday
after we found mr. weaver &apos;s tumor .
look , ldl cholesterol -- 178 .
hdl -- 26 .
triglycerides -- 320 .
glucose -- 152 .
well , this explains the jogging .
i &apos;m such a hypocrite .
i tell people every day how important it is
to eat right and to exercise .
i just think i &apos;m saying it so much , i @-@ i &apos;m not hearing it .
you &apos;re not dying .
the numbers aren &apos;t great , but --
no , i have to make some changes .
starting now .
but -- but not right now .
you go for a jog right this second ,
i don &apos;t think you &apos;d ever be able to walk again .
ow ! okay , i
i did mention not wanting to be punched , didn &apos;t i ?
yeah , uh , but it &apos;s good cardio .
oh , like that really hurt . that hurt ?
the abcs of truma are a handy tool
for keeping a patient alive .
but they &apos;re only a starting point .
uh , hello .
um , i just rang the bell .
no one answered .
um , they did say 8 : 00 , right ?
they did , yeah .
the table is set .
yeah , it is .
it &apos;s ... strange .
once the patient &apos;s airway , breathing , and circulation
are all clear and accounted for ,
the real work begins -- the messy work .
i brought wine .
i &apos;m an alcoholic .
this was a mistake . i &apos;m gonna go .
look , i screwed up !
i @-@ i @-@ i screwed up .
i @-@ i &apos;m sorry .
look , 31 years ago , i had a kid .
and nobody told me .
i &apos;ve known you for only , what , two months .
two months .
most parents mess up a lot in those first few months ,
and it &apos;s fine because t @-@ their kid &apos;s too young
to -- to notice or remember .
but you -- i hurt you , and i @-@ i @-@ i know that .
and all i want to do ...
is just take it back , okay ?
you &apos;ve got the wrong idea .
i &apos;m not angry with you for being a bad father .
you &apos;re not my dad .
you are just a man who slept with a woman
and made it possible for me to be born .
my dad is my present .
you are my past . you are my genetic history .
i didn &apos;t need you to be a good father .
i just needed you to be honest with me ...
from the start ,
instead of letting me walk around here for weeks
like a fool , without a clue , letting me confide in you .
i didn &apos;t know what to do .
and i &apos;ll never be anything but sorry for that .
there &apos;s no telling how long it &apos;s going to take
to clean up that chaos ...
okay .
good night .
... once you &apos;ve begun ...
sorry .
i think i must &apos;ve lost track of time .
i hope you brought a , uh , an appetite .
... because sometimes you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re in for .
can i talk to you ?
actually , i wanted to talk to you .
dr. herman , i wasn &apos;t kidding when i said that i --
that i -- that i wanted this fellowship ,
and today &apos;s surgery only confirmed that more for me .
close the door .
but no matter how much i need or want this fellowship ,
i refuse to spend the year with you speaking to me
the way that you speak to me .
we won &apos;t have a year together .
fine .
great . thanks .
i &apos;ll be dead in six months .
you don &apos;t know exactly what you &apos;re about to face .
i have a brain tumor .
it &apos;s inoperable .
i thought i had longer ,
but it &apos;s growing .
soon , i will show symptoms , and after that , i will die .
who knows about this ?
hunt ? uh , anyone ?
fetal surgery is a new field .
the few of us who are practicing it
are basically inventing it as we go along .
the things i know ,
the things i scribble down in the margins ,
no one has them .
they &apos;re not in any textbook . they &apos;re only in my brain .
so i can fight to write papers
and try to get them published ,
or i can use the time i have left
to try to teach you
a year &apos;s worth of medicine in six months .
or ...
you can tell hunt and the board ,
and it all goes away forever .
you don &apos;t know what secrets
the body in front of you holds ...
i don &apos;t know how to feel about this .
well , hurry up and decide .
we don &apos;t have any time to waste .
... and whether , by the time it &apos;s all over ,
if there &apos;s anything left worth saving .
