太公生快有缘再见猫中王 恭贺寿星秋季再聚醉芝士
how &apos;s your mom holding up ?
she &apos;s doing okay , but we just lost another nurse .
how many is that now ?
two ,
and i know what you &apos;re thinking--
she &apos;s eating them .
she &apos;s just so impossible , they keep quitting .
so , who &apos;s watching her now ?
a bowl full of m &amp; m &apos;s with a few ambien tossed in .
what up , guys ?
hello .
hey . hello .
okay .
well , now that everyone &apos;s here ,
penny and i have some big news .
we &apos;re engaged !
oh my god !
and i thought me having sex with emily was gonna be the big news .
what the hell !
you guys propose all the time .
this never happens .
you &apos;re right !
boy , i &apos;m so hungry today .
i wonder why ?
because you had sex the other night ?
you know what ?
that may be it .
by the way , it isn &apos;t like riding a bike .
like , i fell off a few times .
hey , buddy .
hello .
you okay ?
i just got called into president siebert &apos;s office .
the university won &apos;t let me
switch my field of study to inflationary cosmology .
they &apos;re forcing me to continue with string theory .
why ?
he said it &apos;s why they hired me ,
it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s what my grant was designated for ,
and that everybody has to do things they don &apos;t want to do .
he then gave an example of something he had to do ,
even though he didn &apos;t want to ,
which was look at my stupid face .
that &apos;s a rude thing to say .
out loud .
it &apos;s an outrage .
honestly , i &apos;m tempted to leave the university .
you know , if you &apos;re really serious about that ,
i hear there are some exciting opportunities
in home care for the old and fat .
whatever you do , just don &apos;t make any rash decisions .
i don &apos;t know .
i am really aggravated .
when i &apos;m feeling low , i have sex with a girl .
but that &apos;s just me .
oh , come on , give her a chance .
no .
life , it is too short .
i know you &apos;ve only been here a day and a half ,
but you &apos;re like part of the family !
i don &apos;t think the service is gonna send any more people .
yeah , maybe it &apos;s time we just release ma back into the sea .
that &apos;s not helpful .
well , then , we may need to get used to the idea
that we &apos;re gonna be living here the next few months .
but we have jobs .
we can &apos;t baby @-@ sit her 24 hours a day .
well , what if we use our vacation time ?
i wanted to go to hawaii , not hell .
i don &apos;t know what else we can do .
howie , i love you ,
and as your wife , your mother is every bit
as much my problem as she is yours , so ...
i want a divorce .
hello , leonard .
hi , mom .
i have some exciting news .
i &apos;m listening .
before i tell you ,
will you promise to try and be happy for me
and keep any concerns you have to yourself ?
no .
let me save you all of your hemming and hawing .
sheldon already told me that you and penny are engaged .
i @-@ i hate that you talk to him more than you talk to me .
would you like for you and me to talk more ?
you know what ? it &apos;s probably fine .
in any event , while i &apos;ve had my misgivings about ...
penny ...
... sheldon spoke very fondly of her ,
and if she is good enough for him ,
then she &apos;s good enough for me .
i &apos;m your son .
what about the fact that she &apos;s good enough for me ?
sure .
thanks , mom .
leonard , would it make you feel better to hear that
your mother approved of your life choices ?
yes , it would .
yeah . well , you should work on that .
no , mom , it &apos;s the same guy
i &apos;ve been going out with for the past two years .
yeah , the scientist .
well , it &apos;s complicated .
i mean , he works with lasers and atomic magnets .
no , i did not see it coming .
no , we did not set a date .
no , i am not pregnant .
yeah , this is a first for our family .
all right , tell dad i love him . i gotta go .
all right , bye .
atomic magnets ?
shut up .
sorry i &apos;m late .
the leaf blower broke ,
so i had to hand @-@ dry my mother @-@ in @-@ law .
you want some wine ?
thanks .
little warning before you jump into this marriage business :
you &apos;re not just marrying him ,
you &apos;re marrying his family .
i think leonard &apos;s mom &apos;s okay with me .
it doesn &apos;t matter if she &apos;s okay with you .
the question is : can she go to the bathroom by herself ?
hit me again .
so , what are the living arrangements gonna be ?
well , haven &apos;t really talked about it yet ,
but i figure , at some point ,
i &apos;ll move in with him , or he &apos;ll move in with me .
well , with you not working , that makes financial sense .
you &apos;re not working !
how would you like a job in home health care ?
not a chance .
please . i &apos;m desperate .
no .
i &apos;ll pay you anything you want .
okay , then , yeah .
no ! keep your money !
i could &apos;ve ridden a bull longer than that .

what you working on ?
i &apos;m writing an appeal to the faculty senate ,
so that i can move on from string theory .
oh . how &apos;s it going ?
you tell me .
&quot; dear esteemed colleagues ,
as you may know , i have requested to change my field of study .
my decision to do so is , i believe ,
in the best interest of science .
at your convenience , i &apos;d be happy to explain it to you
in words you &apos;ll understand . &quot;
it &apos;s nice that you called them &quot; esteemed . &quot;
you &apos;re right . i &apos;ll take that out .
so , listen , there was something i was hoping to float past you .
now that penny and i are engaged ,
i thought we might want to talk about our living arrangements .
of course .
she &apos;s spent many nights here ,
and you &apos;re worried about preserving
the myth of her virginity before the wedding .
i &apos;m not .
good , because not only has that ship sailed ,
if it hit an iceberg , countless men would perish .
actually , this is about where she and i are going to live .
what do you mean ?
well ... well , we might want to live together .
oh , yeah , well , i &apos;ve already given this some thought ,
and ...
i &apos;m willing to let penny live with us
one day a week for a trial period .
now , obviously , not when she &apos;s made cranky
by the shedding of her uterine lining .
that &apos;s very sweet .
but we were thinking more of us maybe living together with ...
not you .
i don &apos;t understand .
how could we all live together if i &apos;m not there ?
look , i @-@ i know this is ... this is change ,
and that sounds scary , but ...
where are you going to go ?
i don &apos;t know .
we just started to think about this .
maybe i &apos;ll move in with penny ,
or maybe she and i &apos;ll take this place ,
and you can move across the hall .
move across the hall ? !
did you take a marijuana ? !
no , i did not .
did you get hit on the head with a coconut ?
no .
well , then , i &apos;m all out of guesses .
what ? me move across the hall--
why would you even suggest such a thing ?
because i love penny ,
and want to give her the life she deserves .
i see .
you &apos;re putting your future bride &apos;s happiness above mine .
well , yeah .
how dare the university force me to go back to string theory !
they just don &apos;t appreciate you .
yeah , and on top of that ,
leonard has the audacity to suggest that
now that he and penny are engaged ,
he may not want to live with me anymore .
here , i made you some strawberry quik .
i have real problems here , amy .
i can &apos;t be mollified with a beverage designed for children .
mmm ! yummy .
you know , this might work out for the best .
i mean , you &apos;re always complaining about
what a terrible roommate leonard is .
like how he turns up the thermostat when you &apos;re not there .
it &apos;s like walking into the amazon .
and not the good amazon with one @-@ day shipping .
the awful one with birds and snakes .
you hate the sound of all those keys on his key chain .
four keys !
who does he think he is , a warden ?
see ? maybe you &apos;ll love living alone .
i don &apos;t know . perhaps .
and if it turns out you don &apos;t ...
you and i could live together .
you and ... oh , sure .
and while we &apos;re at it , why don &apos;t we get engaged , too ?
why don &apos;t we get a little house , start a family ?
enjoy our sunset years together ?
do you hear yourself , woman ? !
sheldon , it was just a thought .
no . here &apos;s a thought .
you &apos;re not moving in ,
leonard &apos;s not moving out ,
everything stays exactly the way it is .
yeah , and by the way ,
i saw you make this strawberry quik with syrup ,
and you &apos;re supposed to use the powder !
it tastes the same .
no . the syrup tastes better and i don &apos;t like it .
this is so sweet !
you never cook for me .
well ...
you cook for me all the time and ...
if you don &apos;t like my cooking ,
why haven &apos;t you ever said anything ?
it &apos;s hard to talk with so much heavy chewing to do .
sorry . i &apos;ll get better .
i know you &apos;ll try .
so , should we talk about setting a date ?
well , i &apos;d like to pick one that works with my brother &apos;s schedule .
okay . and when would that be ?
uh , 12 to 18 months from now , depending on good behavior .
hi , is sheldon here ?
no , i thought he was with you .
he was , but he stormed off
and now he isn &apos;t answering his phone .
what happened ?
he was really angry that you suggested he move out .
i also mentioned that he and i could live together
but he was too mad at you to realize
what a great idea that is .
well , he &apos;s been having a couple of tough days .
i &apos;m sure he &apos;s fine . he probably just
needs a little alone time to decompress .
you &apos;re probably right .
so , what are you guys doing ?
well , leonard cooked for me and now we &apos;re just having
a nice dinner , you know , as a newly engaged couple .
that &apos;s nice .
anyway , as i was saying ,
sheldon probably just needs a little alone time .
&apos;cause that &apos;s important .
not just for him , but for ...
most anybody , really .
don &apos;t i know it .
what is that , polenta ?
amy , get out .
right .
no .
hey , sheldon .
what happened ?
i was cooking in the back room last night
and the hot plate caught on fire .
and you couldn &apos;t put it out ?
i was across the street
at the do @-@ it @-@ yourself car wash , taking a shower .
so when will you reopen ?
um , i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m waiting to hear back from the insurance company .
so , tomorrow ?
i don &apos;t mean to be rude , sheldon , but , uh ,
my life is kind of falling apart right now .
your life ?
the university is making me do string theory
and my girlfriend loves me so much she wants to live with me .
and now , the place i need to go when i &apos;m sad
is damp and smells funny .
well , sorry i let you down .
no .
i do not accept this .
everything is changing and i hate it .
it stops now .
i &apos;m helping you get back on your feet .
i would like to purchase this comic book , please .
that &apos;ll be $ 2.99 .
really ? it &apos;s soaking wet .
fine , a dollar .
can you break a 20 ?
no , i only have hundreds .
you know what ?
i don &apos;t always recognize sarcasm , but i do right now ,
and i don &apos;t appreciate it .
i &apos;m sorry for your loss .
but you &apos;re not the only one whose day has been a disaster .
that could have killed me .
i can &apos;t catch a break .
i haven &apos;t heard from sheldon in a while .
you think he &apos;s okay ?
oh , i &apos;m sure he &apos;s fine .
i &apos;m gonna see where he is .
how ?
oh , i know his password , so i can track his phone .
you do that ?
not always ,
but ever since he wandered off at the swap meet chasing a balloon ,
i get worried .
he can take care of himself .
look , we went over stranger danger
and gave him that whistle .
that &apos;s weird .
what ?
he &apos;s at the train station .
so ? he loves trains .
it &apos;s dark out and he &apos;s alone , i don &apos;t like it .
let &apos;s go get him .
oh , it &apos;s sweet how you look out for him .
you &apos;re a good guy .
it &apos;s not just that .
my mother would kill me if i let something happen to him .
dude , i &apos;m so sorry .
don &apos;t take this the wrong way ,
but did you do this for the insurance money ?
no . god , you sound like the police , the firemen ,
my parents , my therapist and the insurance company .
we &apos;re here for you , man . whatever you need , okay ?
uh , actually , i was wondering if i could
crash at your place for a few nights .
sure , of course .
oh , actually , emily was gonna spend the night .
you slept with her ? nice .
well , i can &apos;t take all the credit .
she let me do it to her , but ...
uh , but i can always call her and cancel .
hang on . i know a place you can stay
and earn some money at the same time .
great .
i just have to warn you ,
it &apos;ll involve humiliation , degradation and verbal abuse .
so what &apos;s the catch ?
sheldon .
you tracked my phone ?
yeah .
boy , you chase one balloon for three miles .
we were worried about you .
don &apos;t be melodramatic .
i &apos;m just getting on a train and leaving forever .
seriously ?
you don &apos;t even have a change of clothes or a toothbrush .
my plan is to stop at malls and buy what i need .
it &apos;s called living off the land .
okay , i know you &apos;re upset
and there &apos;s a lot of stuff going on ,
but it &apos;s nothing we can &apos;t work out .
come on , let &apos;s get you home .
no . i &apos;ve reached my breaking point .
i need to leave . now .
and go where ?
it doesn &apos;t matter .
so a few things don &apos;t go your way
and your best decision is to ride the rails like a hobo ?
i suppose it is .
except i have a credit card .
and i refuse to carry my laptop at the end of a stick .
and i &apos;d sooner die than eat beans out of a can .
come on , come home with us
and tomorrow i &apos;ll @-@ i &apos;ll take you to legoland .
legoland is not the solution to everything .
and it &apos;s too much of a scene
since that movie came out .
then what can i do ?
leonard , i am overwhelmed .
everything is changing and it &apos;s simply too much .
i need to get away and think .
oh , c @-@ come on , you know you &apos;re overreacting .
leonard , hang on .
just ... come here for a second .
maybe we need to let him go .
what ? ! why ?
it might be good for him .
y @-@ you know he can &apos;t take a trip like this by himself .
he &apos;s a grown man .
no , he looks like a grown man .
you &apos;ve seen freaky friday ,
sometimes little kids end up in big person bodies .
leonard , we can &apos;t protect him forever .
i know , but ...
he &apos;ll be okay .
you taught him well , padawan .
good lord !
padawan &apos;s the student , not the teacher .
seriously , let him go .
sheldon , if you really need to do this ,
i &apos;m not gonna stand in your way .
i do .
okay .
good luck .
be safe and call us .
i will .
bye , buddy .
sheldon ...
yes ?
i &apos;m gonna miss you .
of course you are .
he just made that easier .
what are you guys still doing here ?
i got this , go . go home .
you sure ?
yeah , she &apos;s fed , she took her pills ,
she &apos;s all tucked in and watching tv .
so , she &apos;s not too much for you ?
are you kidding ? i love her , she &apos;s great .
stewie , you gonna watch wheel of fortune with me ?
coming , debbie .
you call her debbie ?
she insisted .
so , hey , guys , thank you so much .
this job is a dream come true .
was that a little weird ?
yeah . i don &apos;t know why ,
but something about it feels ...
unnatural .
okay , let &apos;s go .
yep .
okay , sheldon , thanks for checking in .
talk to you tomorrow ?
o @-@ okay , bye .
he &apos;s okay ?
actually sounds like he &apos;s doing pretty well .
i really think this is gonna be for the best .
me , too .
and he was able to take a sabbatical from ...
how could you let him go ?
