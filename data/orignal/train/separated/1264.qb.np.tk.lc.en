作者伊森 · 斯莱特
come on , ethan ! open up !
it &apos;s me -- juliet !
unlock the door .
okay , i &apos;m dying to know
why cavanaugh brought us all in early .
me too . can &apos;t be good news , right ?
maybe angelina jolie is playing a homicide cop
and wants to do a ride @-@ along .
yeah , that must be it .
no coffee ? what the hell ?
what ?
try some green tea .
only 15 milligrams of caffeine .
anybody want fresh mint for their tea ?
how nice . thank you .
no . we want caffeine .
i &apos;m not allowed to serve coffee today .
said who ?
morning .
him .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;re all wondering why i asked you in early today .
actually , we were wondering
where the coffee is , sir .
i &apos;m glad you asked -- &apos; cause the homicide squad
is taking part in &quot; week of health . &quot;
are you raising your hand ?
dr. isles ?
i &apos;m happy to do whatever i can to support this program .
swell .
and why is that ?
is it because 70 % of all medical costs are related to smoking ,
physical inactivity ,
poor food choices , and stress ?
well , yes , which leads to
higher @-@ than @-@ average mortality rates for cancer ,
suicide , and heart disease .
maybe because somebody took their coffee away .
on average , police officers only live
two to five years after retiring .
what ?
she &apos;s right .
and i &apos;m not standing by and letting my people drop dead .
well , what do we do ?
well , mrs. rizzoli and detective rizzoli ,
i &apos;d like to ask you to join dr. isles
as our wellness captains .
what ?
how about a nice , big round of applause
for our new wellness captains ?
mrs. rizzoli will provide meals ,
dr. isles will guide us in meditation ,
and detective rizzoli will lead us in physical @-@ activity breaks .
why didn &apos;t you give me a heads @-@ up ?
i could have stopped at boston joe &apos;s !
oh , this aggressive behavior proves you &apos;re a caffeine addict .
well , let &apos;s just take a moment and celebrate the fact
lieutenant cavanaugh wants us to be captains .
he wants us to be hall monitors , maura .
we got to go . we got a high @-@ profile suicide .
great ! come on , frost .
we can stop and get some coffee .
detective frost ?
yes ?
i &apos;m eric palmer .
this is my son bradley .
you arrested quentin morris .
he killed my girlfriend , katrina .
right . the prep @-@ school murder out in amherst .
i &apos;m very sorry .
don &apos;t be .
quentin morris lost his last bid for a new trial .
his final appeal was denied yesterday .
really ? it wasn &apos;t my case .
i hadn &apos;t been following it .
at least quentin morris will pay for what he did to her .
i &apos;m sorry . we &apos;re late for a crime scene .
of course . but , please , take this .
i can &apos;t accept anything .
it &apos;s made out to the police athletic league
in your honor .
it &apos;s a small token of our gratitude .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
25 grand ? some token .
yeah .
what &apos;s the matter ?
i don &apos;t know .
i guess -- i guess i was hoping
quentin morris would get one more shot at it .
why ? you think he was innocent ?
well , there was a lot of evidence
that connected him to the rape and murder
of katrina livingston .
well , i remember .
gifted black kid on scholarship out at sudbury academy .
that &apos;s a ritzy prep school .
he hid out in roxbury .
state police asked us to arrest him .
so what &apos;s bugging you ?
i don &apos;t know .
maybe i just need some coffee .
victim was a famous author .
is his name jules verne ?
nice literary reference .
do you see hints of dickens , too ?
victim was a steampunker .
a who ?
steampunkers revere victorian @-@ era fashion
and technology but add a punk spin .
damn .
it &apos;s ethan slater .
&quot; &apos; suicide boy &apos; is a harrowing memoir
&quot; of slater &apos;s drug use , depression ,
and his attempts at suicide . &quot;
sounds good .
look at you , going all gen &quot; y. &quot;
it was a best @-@ seller .
made slater rich and famous .
you find a suicide note ?
yeah .
his editor found his body .
the note was in the typewriter .
she was coming by to collect the manuscript
for his new book .
&quot; i can no longer live with the lies . &quot;
so , what &apos;s in the new manuscript ?
wasn &apos;t here .
slater wrote his books on this manual typewriter .
you mean there was only one copy ?
this is dope .
what ? what is it ?
looks like a laptop in a steampunk case .
phew . i &apos;m glad he wasn &apos;t too retro @-@ cool to own a computer .
this is an unusual knot .
it &apos;s an alpine butterfly bend . i use it on my boat .
it &apos;s not an easy knot to tie .
the ligature marks on his neck are inconsistent with a suicide .
are they consistent with a homicide ?
okay , i &apos;ll make it easy for you .
door number one -- suicide .
door number two -- homicide .
door number three -- suspicious death .
thank you for playing
the &quot; annoy the un @-@ caffeinated detectives &quot; game .
i thought you stopped for coffee .
line was too long .
looks like ethan only used his computer for e @-@ mail .
so where &apos;s the manuscript ?
so , there are the 10 tips to de @-@ stress .
here , take that .
what are you doing , ma ?
oh , ladies ,
please empty your pockets of any unhealthy snacks .
maura , here is your mid @-@ morning snack .
a quinoa wrap ? barf .
oh , look .
a smiley @-@ face sticker .
why do i have a sad sticker ?
because a bad attitude is bad for your body .
well give me the bad @-@ ass sticker , then .
frost had a doughnut this morning .
what &apos;s gonna happen to him ?
excuse me . detective frost ?
i &apos;m vonda morris ,
quentin morris &apos; mother .
i heard his appeal was denied .
i &apos;m sorry .
my boy didn &apos;t kill that girl .
i can &apos;t imagine how difficult this must be for you .
you &apos;re a good man .
and that &apos;s why i &apos;m here . i need your help .
please . you have to look at the case again .
mrs morris ,
the crime occurred outside our jurisdiction .
it was a state police investigation .
you met quentin . you talked with him .
yes , i did . he had so much going for him .
i &apos;m really sorry .
i know he didn &apos;t kill that girl .
somewhere inside , you know it , too .
the evidence against him was overwhelming .
there &apos;s really nothing i can do . i &apos;m sorry .
you can &apos;t change the evidence , frost .
there &apos;s a sticky substance alongside the ligature marks on his neck .
i &apos;ll have trace run tests .
that old prep @-@ school case is really eating away at frost .
tell him to take probiotics . it &apos;s good for anxiety .
it &apos;s time for your five @-@ minute meditation .
turn that off . please .
meditating lowers stress . it improves focus .
i don &apos;t want to have to report you .
report me ?
you &apos;re gonna report me ?
well , i have to
- lieutenant cavanaugh insisted .
okay . 50 push @-@ ups .
now . i don &apos;t want to be forced to report you .
is this a bad time ?
not at all .
the victim &apos;s blood @-@ alcohol results are back .
he was pretty intoxicated -- .18 .
poor guy was out of it when he killed himself .
the pedicles of both c @-@ 2 vertebra were intact .
it wasn &apos;t a hangman &apos;s fracture .
what does that mean ? it &apos;s not a hanging death ?
well , i &apos;d expect to see an injury
from a sudden , forceful hyperextension .
this is an asphyxiation .
okay , i haven &apos;t had any coffee ,
so can we stick to &quot; strangled &quot; or &quot; hung &quot; ?
try again .
strangled .
good .
then hung .
why me ?
maura .
the splinters on the beam should be pointing in the opposite direction .
if he was hung .
if he was first strangled , then hoisted up in the air ...
the splinters would look like this .
&quot; suicide boy &quot; was murdered .
what &apos;s yours say ?
mine &apos;s 140 over 90 .
huh . that &apos;s the same as mine .
frost , that &apos;s not good .
oh , but it &apos;s fine for me ?
he &apos;s uptight about the quentin morris case .
oh , i heard the kid lost his final appeal .
that what &apos;s got your blood pressure up ?
his mother was here putting pressure on him .
thinks her son &apos;s innocent .
oh . that &apos;s tough .
maybe i should have done more .
like what ?
i don &apos;t know .
frost , take an hour to go through the case .
it &apos;ll make you feel better .
as your wellness captain , i insist .
nah .
now that we know it &apos;s a homicide ,
the slater case takes precedence .
i got to give it to this kid . he sure could write .
we need that manuscript he was working on .
frost , is there anything in his phone records ?
he was the only person in boston without a cellphone ,
but at least he sent a lot of e @-@ mail .
lots of correspondence with his editor ,
juliet randall .
what do we know about her ?
she &apos;s based in new york .
says she came to town yesterday to pick up the manuscript .
did you confirm when she arrived ?
no . thinking maybe she drove .
she wasn &apos;t on any flights .
i think maybe she and slater were lovers .
the e @-@ mails between them are pretty cozy .
check out this photo she sent him .
all right , this is interesting --
slater dedicated his book to
&quot; an editor i would sail with on any sea . &quot;
juliet randall is a member
of a sailing club .
bet she could tie an alpine butterfly bend knot .
slater sent juliet an e @-@ mail three months ago
saying the manuscript was finished .
so why is she just coming in now ?
okay , we need to talk to her .
i sent frankie to her hotel to bring her in .
nice !
it &apos;s physical activity time !
no , it is not .
i &apos;m going to kill her .
that should fulfill the physical activity time for today .
glad to hear you &apos;re leading everyone , captain rizzoli .
yes . yes , sir . yes . everybody up !
stand up . on -- on your feet !
because ... we are ... jogging !
we are jogging in place . doesn &apos;t that feel good ?
detective rizzoli ? - we are jogging . yes . isn &apos;t --
janie !
what ? god .
brought in your suspect .
when you &apos;ve finished with your calisthenics ,
maybe you want to talk to her .
thank you .
stop !
i &apos;m telling you , i don &apos;t know where the manuscript is .
you came to boston to get it , though , right ?
ethan called me two days ago .
said that if i didn &apos;t show up , he would burn it .
sounds like he was angry with you .
it was mutual .
he was three months past his deadline .
were you romantically involved with ethan slater ?
not really .
&quot; not really &quot; ?
look , it was never ... anything .
we think you came to boston
to make sure that ethan didn &apos;t burn that manuscript .
and then when he wouldn &apos;t give it to you ,
you staged his murder to look like a suicide .
suicide boy finally does it .
bet that would be good for sales .
you &apos;re wrong .
i flew up early this morning ,
and i went straight to his apartment .
he was dead when i got there .
that &apos;s funny -- your name isn &apos;t on
any flight manifest .
i flew up on a private jet .
we &apos;ll need that tail number .
of course .
ethan was a brilliant writer .
i really hope that his manuscript wasn &apos;t lost .
the tail number , ms. randall .
detective frost . come in .
sorry , i didn &apos;t mean to interrupt .
would you like to join me in a meditation ?
actually , i was wondering if you could take a look
at an old autopsy report .
the prep @-@ school murder .
jane mentioned that you were concerned about it .
quentin morris &apos; dna
was found on the murder victim , katrina livingston .
an eyewitness testified that he left her dorm room
around the time she was raped and murdered .
you &apos;d like me to review the autopsy ?
yeah .
i don &apos;t know why i &apos;m worrying about this now .
do you identify with quentin ?
i was one of three black kids at an elite , all @-@ white prep school .
i just keep thinking that with so much evidence
against one kid who didn &apos;t belong ,
maybe they didn &apos;t look any further .
i &apos;ll look through this .
would you look at my interrogation of quentin , too ?
what am i looking for ?
something i &apos;m not seeing .
i haven &apos;t thought of this case in two years .
why am i sweating it now ?
it doesn &apos;t matter why , frost .
if there &apos;s something to find , you and maura need to find it .
could be nothing ,
but my gut &apos;s been jumping all day .
yeah . mine , too .
maybe it &apos;s because of these dried beets .
yuck . ugh . have you tried this stuff ?
it tastes like sweat and rotten celery .
stop drinking it .
and stop drinking your own sweat , too .
jane ?
something &apos;s going on with ma .
maybe she ate too many chia seeds .
jane , she &apos;s growing herbs .
did you spot cannabis between the basil and the rosemary ?
she hasn &apos;t gardened since pop left .
oh , no . i hope she &apos;s not
enjoying her life again .
okay , she &apos;s suddenly interested in lip balm ,
and she asked me if the pants she was wearing
made her look fat .
that is bad . no , that &apos;s a bad sign .
i told you .
you can stop pretending like you &apos;re working , korsak .
you &apos;re screwing around with the book .
oh , yeah ? listen to this .
&quot; i met sadie in a suicide chat room . &quot;
what the hell is wrong with kids these days ?
i &apos;m waiting to hear the &quot; working &quot; part .
&quot; sadie was into steampunk and suicide , too .
&quot; we made a pact to end our lives .
we said goodbye in the chat room that brought us together . &quot;
slater tried to kill himself as part of a suicide pact ?
yeah . and according to his book , sadie was successful .
well , maybe somebody close to sadie
blames &quot; suicide boy &quot; for her death .
no record of any &quot; sadie &quot; committing suicide in boston
in the last two years .
maybe slater made her up for dramatic effect .
yeah , like that guy on &quot; oprah &quot;
that wrote that fake memoir .
&quot; oprah &quot; ?
what , i can &apos;t have a sensitive side ?
maybe slater changed sadie &apos;s name so he wouldn &apos;t get sued .
oh , he did .
&quot; names have been changed
to protect the not @-@ so @-@ innocent . &quot;
frost , look up slater &apos;s 911 call
for his attempted suicide two years ago .
see if it &apos;s still in the system .
found it . february 12 , 2010 .
911 . what &apos;s the emergency ?
i need an ambulance . i slit my wrists .
i &apos;m bleeding !
any other suicide calls that day ?
well , someone reported a suicide -- kevin baker .
911 . what &apos;s your emergency ?
i &apos;m at 5392 stone avenue .
oh , my god !
my sister -- she -- she slit her wrists .
tamara !
oh , my god .
here &apos;s the police report .
tamara baker , 19 .
her brother found her body .
she was a steampunker .
maybe tamara baker was sadie .
running kevin baker &apos;s name .
check out her brother &apos;s website .
i &apos;m thinking maybe her brother kevin blamed ethan slater .
looks like kevin holds a grudge .
frost , click on that video link .
suicide is not something you --
you write about and make money off of .
this sick , punk coward took my sister from me .
here &apos;s what i think about him and this piece of trash .
i hope he burns just like it .
only 40 views .
kevin didn &apos;t find much of a sympathetic audience .
must have pissed him off even more ,
when &quot; suicide boy &quot; sold five million copies .
let &apos;s bring him in .
what ? maura &apos;s got something ?
it can wait .
frost , go . we got this .
state police are on their way , quentin .
you &apos;re looking at murder .
murder ? look , this is crazy , okay ?
i did not murder katrina .
now , i don &apos;t know what they &apos;re saying they found ,
and i get why sudbury academy thinks it &apos;s me ,
but i didn &apos;t do this !
both of quentin &apos;s upper eyelids droop slightly ,
his eyes lose focus ,
the corners of his lips pull down .
okay , so , what does that mean ?
quentin &apos;s micro @-@ expressions
indicate that he was under great duress .
he was about to be charged with murder .
it &apos;s not fear projected on his face .
that &apos;s anguish . grief .
there &apos;s something you &apos;re not telling me , quentin .
you got to believe me , detective , okay ?
i didn &apos;t do this .
then give me something i can work with , quentin .
me and katrina were together .
okay , nobody knew but her homegirl ann .
all right , just ask ann . please .
who is ann ?
katrina livingston &apos;s best friend .
she lived across the hall .
she was the commonwealth &apos;s star witness .
is the person you saw exiting the victim &apos;s room
in the courtroom ?
yes . that &apos;s him .
let the record show
that the witness has identified the defendant .
did katrina ever tell you that she had
an intimate relationship with the defendant ?
she was going out with bradley .
and quentin took her from bradley , from all of us .
she doesn &apos;t answer her question .
you &apos;re right -- she dodges it .
her face also exhibits hot spots .
she &apos;s attempting to convey anger and disgust ,
but her raised , drawn @-@ together eyebrows
indicate that she &apos;s masking deep fear .
quentin begged me to talk to ann .
she was probably terrified
by the time the state police got to her .
well , it wasn &apos;t your case , frost .
it still isn &apos;t .
what do i do , dr . isles ?
pursue the truth .
ann has more to say .
i &apos;m sorry about your sister &apos;s suicide .
it wasn &apos;t a suicide . tamara was murdered .
the police report says she slit her wrists .
are you saying she didn &apos;t do that ?
i &apos;m saying ethan slater got in her head
and talked her into killing herself .
she &apos;s bleeding out , he &apos;s calling for help .
that &apos;s murder .
she dies .
he lives and makes a fortune writing about her .
so you took justice into your own hands .
your sister killed herself ,
you killed ethan slater .
no , i wish .
i &apos;ve fantasized about killing that bastard a million times .
slashing that punk across his stupid face --
i dream about it .
sounds pretty real to me , kevin .
i wish it had been me .
i wouldn &apos;t have let him go so easy .
but i didn &apos;t do it . i got an alibi .
yeah ? where were you last night ?
30 stories in the air .
i &apos;m a crane operator .
i work the graveyard shift . you can check it out .
close your eyes .
how much longer ?
you &apos;re insufferable .
are we there yet ?
just quiet the chatter in the monkey mind .
inhale deeply through your nose .
exhale .
did you hear that ?
try not to attach to the ambient noise .
no , it sounded like it was coming from
right outside the guest house .
maura ! maura !
ma , what the hell &apos;s going on ?
he fell . hurry , please !
uh , no !
ma !
sean ! sean .
oh , my god . is that cavanaugh ?
jane , call 911 .
no ! no !
no ?
i said no .
that &apos;s an order , rizzoli .
angela , get me a towel .
okay .
and his pants , too , while you &apos;re at it .
what the hell happened to me ?
it appears you experienced a vasovagal episode .
i went outside to get some air .
you live in dorchester .
i got light @-@ headed is all .
is that how your pants fell off ?
jane , don &apos;t embarrass him .
him ? i &apos;ve never been so embarrassed in my life !
well , your dizziness could have been caused by sexual arousal
and the sudden rush of blood to your genitals .
oh , my god .
okay , we weren &apos;t making love .
we were just making out .
i &apos;m gonna have a vasovagal episode if you don &apos;t stop .
please . i beg you .
you should go to the hospital .
no !
maybe you could just stitch his head up ?
well , we need to know what caused this .
when was the last time you ate , lieutenant ?
well , he got his meals at the caf ?
same as you two .
i might have skipped lunch ... and dinner .
you said my healthy food was sensational and delicious .
he meant your healthy food was silent and deadly .
well , a butterfly bandage might close this up .
so how long have you and my boss been seeing each other ?
we are not going there .
you are in a slip ,
and my boss is on my best friend &apos;s couch in his underwear !
what do you have to say for yourself ?
well , i still think you need to be seen in the e.r.
no .
look , no one else can know about this incident .
you know what ? i &apos;m just gonna get in my car and go home .
all right , at least let me drive you home .
please tell me i &apos;m asleep and that was a dream .
okay . come on , guys . like 20 more seconds .
i think i &apos;ve gained two pounds on this program .
do you think i &apos;m building muscle mass ?
well , i &apos;m sure it &apos;s not the doughnuts
i saw in your desk drawer .
oh , i saw you eating a contraband doughnut this morning .
you wellness snitch .
nice jogging , rizzoli .
thank you , sir .
what happened to your head ?
oh , i slipped and fell .
so , where we at on the slater case ?
uh , well , both the suspects have alibis .
so nowhere , really .
slater used pseudonyms for all the drug addicts
and chat @-@ room suicide folks he wrote about .
okay , so run them down , people .
what &apos;s going on with him ?
too many whole grains ?
i &apos;m thinking that old dog got some last night .
you guys got to hear this .
you know , i hear rumors that you &apos;re writing
an explosive follow @-@ up to &quot; suicide boy . &quot;
maybe .
we all have to stop hiding and do the right thing .
that &apos;s all i can say right now .
maybe there was something in his second book .
maybe he was gonna reveal something that got him murdered .
&quot; i looked down at the blood flowing from my wrists
like a river .
i let it pool in my lap .
it took nearly dying to figure out i wanted to live . &quot;
where did slater go after he was treated at mass general ?
after slater was discharged ,
he did 90 days of rehab at the breyer mental health center .
maybe he met somebody there --
somebody who didn &apos;t want their story in his books .
who runs it ?
a dr. george breyer .
i &apos;ll poke around .
is it okay if i go talk to maura about the prep @-@ school murder ?
yeah , frost . you don &apos;t have to ask us . go .
detective frost , this is ann stephens .
thank you so much for coming in to talk to us about katrina .
i &apos;m not really sure why i &apos;m here .
i already told the jury everything i know .
we just wanted to ask you a few questions about katrina
and quentin morris .
he murdered her . i testified .
i have nothing else to say .
we think you &apos;re holding something back .
whatever it is , it &apos;s still bothering you .
now &apos;s the time .
i &apos;m not .
his attorney did this to me , too .
your body is giving you away .
there &apos;s something you &apos;re holding back .
i warned her .
katrina ? you warned katrina ?
but she wouldn &apos;t listen .
she &apos;d already fallen for him .
he wasn &apos;t really one of us .
i told her not to let him in her room .
you mean quentin ?
yes .
so they were involved ?
yes .
why didn &apos;t you tell anyone that ?
because then i &apos;d be helping him get away with it .
you mean quentin ?
he beat my best friend to death .
what if he didn &apos;t ?
i saw quentin leave her room .
i went to the bathroom , came back , and found her body .
he killed her .
i mean , who else could have , right ?
when are we getting coffee back ?
you &apos;ll thank me when you &apos;re old .
i &apos;m not interested in getting old
if all i get to drink is green tea .
hello .
hi , sean .
thanks , mrs. rizzoli .
i , um ... i gave you potatoes instead of quinoa .
you said you &apos;ve missed your potatoes .
i don &apos;t deserve the special treatment .
yeah , you do .
look , angela , you &apos;re a wonderful lady .
but ?
but i got a job to do here .
and i should have never started this .
i &apos;m sorry .
ma , please tell me that you and cavanaugh ...
you &apos;re my mother ! what are you doing ? !
before i was your mother , i was a person .
and what &apos;s so wrong with wanting to be a person again ?
do you want me to punch his lights out ?
no !
thanks . dr. breyer is missing .
ethan slater &apos;s doctor ?
he left yesterday for london to speak at a conference .
never got on the plane .
frost , see if you can track down dr. breyer via his phone &apos;s gps .
on it .
his assistant , chad , was the last person to see him .
he thought dr. breyer took the &quot; t &quot; to logan .
i have dr. breyer &apos;s final gps coordinates on his phone .
when were they transmitted ?
yesterday afternoon .
dr. breyer never left boston .
signal &apos;s coming from a construction site
by a medical center -- right here .
looks like we &apos;re getting closer .
somewhere around here .
dr. breyer was getting a brand @-@ new wing
for his private rehab hospital .
i don &apos;t think dr. breyer
is gonna get to enjoy it , though .
well , he either jumped or was pushed .
i think it &apos;s a piece of a document .
looks like he might have been holding it .
well , if he jumped , what &apos;s he doing holding a piece of paper ?
do you know which occupation has the highest suicide rate ?
homicide detectives while they wait for autopsy results ?
no . physicians .
our suicide rate is nearly double the national average .
it &apos;s even higher than dentists .
maura , is this some kind of cry for help ?
yes , if you meditate with me ,
you will greatly improve the quality of my life .
were you one of those girls that needed another girl
to go with them to the bathroom when you were in 7th grade ?
of course not .
well , then i &apos;m sure that you can quiet the monkey @-@ mind chatter
all by yourself -- i know you can .
in every suicide that i have ever worked ,
the jumper took his glasses off first .
i think dr. breyer was pushed .
i may have found some trace evidence to support your theory .
sharing is caring .
there &apos;s a sticky substance on dr. breyer &apos;s right hand .
it could be the same substance that you found
on ethan slater &apos;s neck .
have you gotten those results back yet ?
trace is still working on it .
it must be from the killer &apos;s gloves .
maybe breyer shook hands with the killer .
call me when you find something , okay ?
all right .
that little scrap of paper we found near breyer &apos;s hand
was from the corner of a personal check .
any idea what bank issued it ?
not yet . susie &apos;s working on it .
i &apos;m gonna guess that somebody lured dr. breyer
up to his new wing with the promise of a big payoff .
well , slater &apos;s murder was staged to look like a suicide .
then the killer steals his manuscript .
then kills dr. breyer ? why ?
well , breyer treated slater in rehab .
maybe dr. breyer knew what ethan slater was writing about .
so the good doctor blackmails the killer
by offering to keep quiet for a price ?
oh , i sent frankie to breyer &apos;s center to get the records .
i found seven patients who were hospitalized
at the same time as slater .
nice , frankie .
okay , uh , rock @-@ star drug addict .
died last year of a drug overdose .
suicidal brahmin shipping heiress .
back in treatment .
the other five are living healthy lives
in other parts of the country .
you know , i bet if we find slater &apos;s manuscript ,
we &apos;ll find his killer .
frost , what &apos;s wrong ?
i went over the prep @-@ school murder case files again .
thought i might discover something after questioning ann .
no one but quentin enters or exits katrina &apos;s dorm room .
maybe ann was right .
maybe quentin did kill her .
why don &apos;t you take a couple hours , frost ,
drive out to amherst ?
yeah . take a look at the crime scene .
see if the state police overlooked anything .
nah . nah . i &apos;m done .
i &apos;ve been too consumed by this .
frost , you &apos;re no good to us until you can focus , okay ? go .
jog there if it makes you feel better .
who &apos;s texting you ?
别告诉简 --安琪拉
oh , new c.i. i &apos;m working with .
i need some dating advice , vince .
full disclosure -- i &apos;ve had three wives .
i &apos;m not much help in the dating department .
but you &apos;ve known lieutenant cavanaugh for a long time .
where &apos;s this headed ?
we &apos;ve been seeing each other .
well , we were .
let me guess . he broke it off .
how &apos;d you know ?
you said it -- i &apos;ve known him a long time .
tell me , vince ,
otherwise i &apos;ll have you eating this health crap forever .
back when we were rookies ,
sean lost his wife and baby son in a fire .
i don &apos;t think he &apos;s even had a serious girlfriend since .
well , that explains some things . i ... oh , i wish he had told me .
i have never heard him talk about it .
hi .
we &apos;re still working on the piece of paper .
latent prints went over the typewriter ,
but it &apos;s just the victim &apos;s prints .
thanks , susie .
wow . a typewriter . makes me feel old .
no , don &apos;t feel old .
a very young victim liked writing books on one .
it &apos;s an old underwood .
i used to have one .
i used to type up plumbing invoices for frank sr.
changing those typewriter ribbons was such a mess .
typewriter ribbon .
angela , you &apos;re a genius .
mention that to your friend sean .
jane , meet me downstairs in the crime lab .
my new c.i. may have just offered up
a breakthrough in the case .
a 1930s underwood model five .
jack kerouac used to use one just like it .
how in the world do you know that ?
well , i saw his typewriter on display
at the lowell national historical park museum .
we &apos;re in luck .
slater &apos;s typewriter uses a single @-@ pass carbon ribbon .
that &apos;s good news .
yes , it &apos;s the most wonderful news i &apos;ve ever heard .
why do we care ?
well , some older typewriters use fabric ribbon ,
and those don &apos;t retain a retrievable , legible text .
but with a carbon ribbon , each keystroke makes a mark .
we write down the characters ,
then figure out where the breaks go between the words .
it &apos;ll take awhile .
the trace results on the sticky substance
from both the victims is back , dr. isles .
thank you , susie .
what is it ?
balsam fir sap .
the same sap that was on ethan slater &apos;s body
and dr. breyer &apos;s body ?
all right , well , don &apos;t look so surprised .
we &apos;re looking for one killer .
yeah , but fragments of solidago macrophylla .
what ? what is it ?
these are the m.e. files that frost asked me to look at .
the prep @-@ school murder ?
yes , and they have the same balsam fir
and fragments of solidago macrophylla .
yeah , it was found in katrina &apos;s closet .
yeah , but it wasn &apos;t considered significant
because katrina was a rock climber .
it still isn &apos;t .
balsam fir trees are common all over the northeast .
but solidago macrophylla isn &apos;t .
it &apos;s unique to the summit of mount greylock
in the berkshires .
so whoever killed katrina , ethan slater , and dr. breyer
would have to be a skilled climber
to get to the top of mount greylock .
i &apos;m glad i took your advice and drove out to amherst .
okay , if that grappling hook
is for the wellness program , you can count me out .
i am not a fan of heights .
aww , i thought we &apos;d take korsak and climb everest .
okay , maybe everest .
i want to show you something i found
when i was looking around katrina &apos;s old dorm room .
okay .
this is the building &apos;s exterior .
you see those marks ?
yeah . you think those are from a grappling hook ?
yeah , i do .
i think that &apos;s why no one saw him
and why quentin was the only one
on the hallway security tape .
so katrina &apos;s killer climbed the wall
and went in through her window .
now , check this out .
oh , that &apos;s the guy who stopped you
in the lobby with his father .
bradley palmer , right ?
yeah , he was katrina &apos;s boyfriend .
they used to lead climbs together
in the white mountain national forest .
you see that ?
alpine butterfly bend .
that &apos;s the same knot used to hang slater .
i sent frankie to slater &apos;s building .
he took some photos of the building &apos;s exterior .
grappling marks .
he got into slater &apos;s apartment the same way .
but here &apos;s what doesn &apos;t make any sense --
what is his connection to slater and slater &apos;s rehab doctor ?
dr. breyer ? i have no idea .
it &apos;s maura . she says we need to get down to the crime lab .
what &apos;s up ?
slater was a terrible typist with bad grammar .
look at this -- he uses &quot; who &quot; instead of &quot; whom , &quot;
&quot; which &quot; instead of &quot; that . &quot;
well , no wonder somebody killed him .
here &apos;s what &apos;s odd --
ethan slater started typing the last page of his manuscript
three months ago .
so what was he typing for the last three months ?
all kinds of things -- letters , poems , essays .
not one word of this manuscript
until right before he was killed .
well , do you have that last page ?
we certainly do , thanks to sergeant korsak .
no , no , thanks to you , dr. isles .
oh , please , sergeant .
i couldn &apos;t have done it without your help .
okay , we &apos;ll throw you both a parade later .
what does it say ?
&quot; he told me after a group session
while he ate a turkey sandwich
that he &apos;d beaten katrina to death
because she cheated on him . &quot;
slater &apos;s talking about bradley palmer ,
katrina &apos;s boyfriend .
yes , he was .
and this was the last sentence that he typed .
&quot; bradley palmer showed up the same day i did
at breyer mental health center ,
but i &apos;d take my suicide attempt over what he did .
he killed his girlfriend . &quot;
damn .
and slater and dr. breyer to keep them quiet .
but why now ? unless ...
frost , did quentin have any legal proceedings
three months ago ?
yeah . his final appeal hearing , but it was postponed .
till yesterday . that &apos;s why now .
slater must have hoped quentin would get a new trial .
and when he didn &apos;t ,
slater made sure that book was ready to go
if bradley didn &apos;t come clean .
eric palmer gave me this check .
what do you think ?
it appears to be the same stock and design .
nice .
detective frost , oh , nice to see you .
would you and your friends like to try our wall ?
we had it set up for our employees to build team skills .
ethan slater told you that if you didn &apos;t tell the truth ,
he would tell it for you in his second book .
what &apos;s this about ?
oh , i think you know , mr. palmer .
that &apos;s why you hid your son at a fancy rehab center
after he killed his girlfriend .
that &apos;s ridiculous .
is it ?
is it also ridiculous
that your son climbed up the side of his girlfriend &apos;s dorm ,
hid in her closet , and beat her to death
after he caught her with quentin ?
y @-@ you can &apos;t prove anything .
bradley !
quentin morris was convicted .
i think i &apos;m just gonna call our lawyers .
do you pay your lawyers with a personal check ?
eric palmer , you &apos;re under arrest for accessory @-@ after @-@ the @-@ fact
in the murder of katrina .
dad , dad , you got to do something .
bradley palmer , you &apos;re under arrest
for the murders of ethan slater , dr. george breyer ,
and katrina livingston .
look at that . quentin morris &apos; mother .
it &apos;s amazing .
her son was going to a prison
for a murder he didn &apos;t commit .
now he &apos;s coming home .
how long until quentin gets released ?
he should be home by the end of the week .
bet your blood pressure &apos;s a lot lower now , huh ?
i always thought the greatest feeling in the world
was putting away bad guys .
it &apos;s not ?
no .
the greatest feeling in the world
is freeing an innocent man .
nicely done , frost .
all in all , a fine day for the good guys .
clearing three murders --
that &apos;s a whole lot of wellness , right ?
i wonder what happened to the manuscript .
i &apos;m guessing it went to a shredder
at palmer industries .
i don &apos;t think anybody ordered a red wine .
actually , i did .
what ?
well , it &apos;s like maura &apos;s always saying --
the resveratrol in red wine is excellent for cardiac health .
you actually listen to me ?
most of the time , yeah .
well , this deserves a toast . salud !
salud ! salud ! salud ! salud !
salud .
