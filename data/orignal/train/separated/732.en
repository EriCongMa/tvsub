My father dissolves our marriage
in favor of more promising opportunity.
Is there nothing left between us?
Memories only.
The arena is burned to fucking ground.
With many Romans among the ashes!
Can he be healed?
This man is beyond what would warrant life.
His name is Oenomaus and he is more than common man.
A hundred more bodies pulled from the arena.
This was found in the wreckage.
The gods have punished me by striking down my father.
It is not enough.
Gaius?
The only reason you have not joined your father
is the child that grows within you.
House slaves will never be gladiators.
We need fighting men.
Perhaps it is time to revisit plans towards Neapolis.
And its slaver ships from foreign wars.
You would attack the port?
第七集
I do not care for the fucking rain.
Nor disturbance at unreasonable hour.
I would have you quickly removed from such concerns.
And well compensated for allowing eyes
upon your latest offerings,
in advance of auction...
You must have pressing need,
to venture out on such a night.
I fear the rising sun would dash hopes of it being met.
Short of time, long of coin.
What form of slave narrows your purpose?
I have a desire towards fighting men.
Ah, gladiators!
I've supplied Rome with many of its' finest champions.
Sadly with the arena in Capua gone,
there's less interest in these men of such talents.
Fortunate for my cause then.
Come.
Let us see how you can further aid it.
Forgive the stench.
Savages east of the Rhine tend to favor their own shit.
I intended to have them scraped
and oiled before auction,
but I feared that would do little to improve
their natural odor.
And how do you find the women?
As unpleasant as their men.
I would not recommend lustful hand placed upon...
Keys, quickly.
Release them.
You not from our lands.
Yet I was once bound in chains by the Romans, as you were.
A grievance I would see them pay dearly for.
He says they are with us.
A fortunate thing.
That we liberate a ship filled with your people.
The gods favor us.
No longer will we have to listen
to those fucking Gauls again.
Geht Bruder.
Good Mercato spoke highly of you.
A grave misfortune that his tongue
has forevebeen silenced.
His passing cause for my presence before you.
Passing?
Too gentle a word for how he was ushered from this life.
Blood and brains staining the pulvinus
as he thought to flee Spartacus' wrath.
A thing that threatens to consume many innocent lives.
We had thought you were mangled corpse,
the sundered beams of the arena your tomb.
The events of the day caused me absent proper mind.
It has since returned.
And you to our streets.
Mercato my purpose, as I said.
There is the matter of coin,
for services tended upon the sands.
You were secured to execute those shits
that follow Spartacus.
I do not recall any falling to your sword.
It would have been happened
had Spartacus not appeared.
And coin would have materialized the same.
Yet the past cannot be altered.
I am without coin, Magistrate.
I would not have returned otherwise.
For your years of pleasing the crowd in the arena.
Now follow once noble monument,
and collapse from sight.
Magistrate? Apologies,
my rudis was lost when the arena fell.
Without it...
You press beyond reason!
I'll winds has blown Capua
from once steady course.
Take further matter to Praetor Glaber.
Perhaps you can entice coin from him as well,
if caught upon proper mood.
...and misfortune.
We have all suffered loss of those closest to us.
Even a senator of our great Republic,
a man my wife called father,
has been ripped from this world
by Spartacus and his mongrel hordes.
And now beloved Seppius
has fallen to this festering disease of rebellion.
Murdered by his own slaves,
who even now spirited themselves away
to join Spartacus against us.
We must be ever vigilant in these dark times.
We must bring to light even dimmest shadow
of betrayal if it is revealed to us.
From this day forward,
any slave who dares to whisper the name Spartacus
shall be put to death.
Even those
owned by a praetor of Rome.
Seize her.
Dominus!
I did nothing!
Dominus!
Do not speak against him.
Listen how she begs!
Pleading with the very tongue
that only yesterday had praise for Spartacus upon it!
Praise for the slaves that murdered Seppius!
Praise most fortunate to be overheard by loyal wife.
Domina...
It is true.
I hear her speak it.
Would that she had more than one life to take.
Let this serve as warning to any slave
who would conspire against us.
Apologies --
None deserved.
It was a foolish attempt.
You seek to part head from shoulders.
There are blows that kill with less effort.
Then I shall learn them.
He is never from her side.
Spartacus wanted him towards Neapolis,
but he would not leave her.
Though perhaps it's best to keep him and Agron parted.
Naevia is blessed to be loved so deeply.
As are you, by Spartacus.
Crixus!
I taught you never to lower guard.
Now see Naevia to same instruction.
Oenomaus.
I thought you for the afterlife.
As I you.
Yet we did not escaped deep wounds.
A thing to be visited upon the Romans a thousand fold.
Now that Oenomaus stands with us once again.
He was a fool to be gone so long from your side.
Such things are of the past.
Let us turn thought towards future.
And what joys it may hold.
You've done the impossible.
Our ranks swell.
We will need more weapons.
A concern that must be addressed.
I sense a deeper one.
These are all fucking Agron's people.
Our forces have doubled in a single day.
With people who are no stranger to battle and blood.
And who will they follow?
I detected a hint of movement in your hips this time.
A subtle thrust
as I bore down.
You begin to enjoy my cock inside of you?
I would have answer.
Yes.
Yes...
what?
Yes, Dominus.
Has a man ever heard so sweet a sound?
Your voice...
your touch...
the warmth of your thighs....
Is it a wonder Quintus fell beneath your spell?
Lavishing you with affection and gifts.
You call me dominus now, in his place.
It is only just that I present you with something in return.
How did you come by such bounty?
They were freely given.
By the dead who no longer have need for them.
When this chest is full,
it's worth shall see Ashur to even greater heights.
Yet
for one such as you...
something purchased with coin...
I know how fond Quintus was of the color.
I would have you wear it.
So that I may look up to you upon the balcony...
and know that you are mine...
Heart has been deeply wounded.
If there is anything to offer as balm,
you need but voice it.
You take command of his men?
I do.
Would that he had given them freely in life.
Spartacus would be a distant memory.
And my brother yet by my side.
If only it had been so.
My father would yet grace this world.
And my slave would have had no cause to be crucified.
Your brother's men arrive.
Come.
Let us review them,
and bind them to cause with oath of loyalty.
Fall to attention!
Hold tongue...
and give attention!
Who stands forth as your voice?
Octavius Tarsus.
I stand for them.
Your benefactor has been ripped from this world by the villain Spartacus.
Towards his end,
I conscript you and your men
into the army of Gaius Claudius Glaber.
Recite the Sacramentum, and commit loyalty.
I, Octavius Tarsus,
swear by Jupiter Optimus Maximus,
that I shall uphold and defend the Republic.
I swear to have her enemies as my enemies
and her friends as my friends.
You've taken to your old color.
I fear it no longer suits me.
... her honor in all my thoughts, words, and actions.
I pledge my body and life to the Republic and to its army
under the leadership of Praetor Gaius Claudius Glaber.
Will they be enough?
Added to my own troops, yes.
They will be enough to bring Spartacus to justice.
I do not seek justice.
I seek vengeance.
The man who took the life of my brother must die the same.
In blood and slaughter.
By Jupiter Optimus Maximus, I so swear.
By Jupiter Optimus Maximus, we so swear.
Set camp outside these walls.
Salvius will see you to orders.
And the death of Spartacus.
Gratitude for your kindness.
Know that I have treasured it.
Perhaps it would be best if you made home here.
Beneath our roof.
I leave in the morning for my uncle's villa in Pompeii.
I would not have you upon the road
while the threat of Spartacus still remains.
I will send word to your uncle,
if you find solace in the thought.
Your presence offers great comfort.
I am blessed to find myself among you.
Come.
Let us make arrangements.
Was it so recent that I thought him weak?
I now gaze into his eyes and tremble
at what lurks behind them.
Do not work yourself into an unfortunate state.
Your child --
Is the only reason I yet live.
Nothing I do pleases him.
He tortures me for what I have done.
Thessala crucified.
Seppia invited into our house.
The way he looks at her...
I would see myself over cliff,
if this is all fate now holds.
My heart would follow to the rocks below.
I cannot live like this.
Nor I.
The last of our meat.
I forgot how much my kin devour upon a sitting.
Much seems to have slipped mind of late.
You sent me to scout Neapolis
and report on opportunity.
Their ship provided it.
Were there any others that may have afforded the same?
Two.
One from Damascus.
The other Gaullia.
News I would have cared to know.
Men from Damascus are of low quality
and even lower trust.
And Gaullia?
I would not have these ranks filled with Gauls.
Crixus -- - Is an honorable man.
I will take your brothers to hunt when day breaks,
to replenish supply.
And gauge how we might come together.
Tell those who are able to speak in common tongue.
So all among us may know their thoughts.
They will prove great asset.
I give you my word.
Cunt.
Nothing's free.
I heard you were dead.
Carried to the afterlife with all the others
that fell beneath the arena.
I yet breathe.
My purse however has suffered fatal blow.
I have no coin to pry open thighs.
They may yet widen, of their own accord.
A miracle lacking profit.
For you and your master.
Do you recall what it was like to have one?
Before you gained your freedom?
No man is ever truly free.
Except for Spartacus.
And those who follow him.
Did you see him when he attacked the arena?
What form of man was he?
You speak of dangerous things.
I'm not the only one.
There's talk among many of us
towards joining his cause.
There is no cause...
Only the leading of innocent fools to their death.
You have no coin then?
A few denarii for passage away from this fucking city.
Strike Spartacus from your thoughts,
and come with me...
The mighty Gannicus.
It is joyous occasion,
to find you yet alive.
With ripe offering perched upon lap.
Apologies.
It is unforgivable to come between man and cunt,
yet I must have words with my brother.
An enticing creature.
Of course you never lacked the attention of fine women.
If you seek words, break them and be done.
The years have not seen you to better manners.
Nor you to better company.
I would advise caution.
These men are the hand of
Praetor Gaius Claudius Glaber.
And what are you?
His cock or his ass?
I am his will.
Bound by duty to restore order.
By nailing little girls to the cross?
Any slaves who whispers of Spartacus and his rebellion...
shall find place beside her.
I have no interest in whispers.
Nor the will of your praetor.
Bold words.
From a slave.
You mistake me.
I am a free man.
Yes, I was there upon the sands
when you became a god of the arena!
It was a sight never to be forgotten!
Gannicus, besting twenty gladiators
in the primus of the opening day!
And his reward?
The rudis!
A wooden sword carved with the legend of his victories!
Proof of freedom, demanded by adoring crowd!
Show them.
I am sure they would be eager
to lay eyes upon such rare marval.
No?
You do not have it upon you?
You know I do not.
As I know the praetor will be most pleased
with the presence of your company...
I find it surprising that you are still of this world.
More so that you did not think it wise
to present yourself at sooner convenience.
Apologies.
Gannicus has always been a man of few words.
Yet he favor the Magistrate with whole sentences, I'm told.
I sought only to conclude business.
You aim too low.
Spartacus brings the arena down upon you,
and yet here you stand.
A phoenix risen from its ashes.
The gods have truly blessed him.
As they now bless me,
with his presence.
I was moved by the reaction of the crowd,
when you stepped upon the sands.
The swell of their voices, heralding your name.
Filling the air with hope.
Even tarnished by blood and calamity,
such a thing yet can hold value...
Your rudis.
And its price?
A simple oath.
Edging yourself to my command.
Lucretia was also once thought victim of Spartacus.
Yet now stands a powerful symbol,
used to calm spreading concern.
I would add you as such.
A former slave of the House of Batiatus,
now sworn to bring errant brothers to justice.
It appears you already have one of those.
Ashur's talents are of the shadows.
I would present you in glorious light
at the front of my troops.
To the roar of the crowd once again.
And if I no longer crave for such a clamor?
You're a free man.
Your fate is your own.
I will send for you again in a few days.
And expect reasonable decision to accompany you.
Praetor.
Forgive me, Praetor,
but Gannicus cannot be trusted.
The same once said of you.
Yet here you stand.
See one of your men to follow.
If Gannicus attempts to leave Capua,
crucify him.
Is there no other way?
You were right about Gaius.
The man he was no longer peers from behind his eyes.
He will not bewayed by words or gentle touch.
Only blood can set us free now.
Lucretia...
It will hurt but for a moment.
Lift your dress.
Neapolis?
A slaver ship was set upon.
It carried prisoners captured east of the Rhine.
Warriors.
To aid Spartacus' cause.
An obvious conclusion.
Dispatch men to Neapolis.
Question anyone who may have seen
where they were headed after liberation.
Praetor.
Gaius...
Fetch the medicus.
Quickly!
Ilithyia!
What has happened to her?
It is a sign from the gods.
One carried by the child yet to breath life.
And its meaning?
Your heir will die if it remains in a city
cursed with blood and fear.
I will have her carried to Rome as soon as she's able.
With trusted guard to watch over her at all times, until my return.
I shall accompany her and tend to her needs.
Apologies, Praetor.
Lucretia's a dear friend to your wife,
yet offers greater comfort to Capua.
I fear the people will fall to despair,
absent her divine presence.
Wise counsel.
Have your presence known tomorrow in the market.
Ease mind of our city,
and continue to assure them the gods favor my efforts.
We have been training those freed of bond.
Yet none among us ever held title of Doctore.
I have no knowledge of soldiers and war.
I know only the ways of a gladiator.
I can think of no fiercer army, so instructed.
Open their eyes as man can do giving a course.
As you have opened mine.
I hunt with Agron and his people,
to better gauge them.
I will lend aid when I return.
I fear you hunt alone.
Agron left with the others before light broke.
Agron.
You hunt without me,
when you knew my intention.
They woke before the sun,
and were eager to take advantage of freedom.
We hunt.
Catch meat.
And Roman drink!
I did not know these forests were stocked with such.
Where did you come by this?
A wagon along the road --
You attacked the road so close to our position?
Absent proper weapons?
No one see.
All dead.
Glad I risked my life for this lot.
They see us to prope force.
They see us to nothing but discovery.
Let the Romans come.
I'm tired of hiding like frightened bbits.
We are not ready for a direct assault.
Something even a child could see.
This child helped save you from the arena.
And fills our numbers with warriors.
The pup has found himself nothing but a pack of wild dogs.
Ones that will never follow a fucking Gaul.
Apologies for leaving without you.
I question that boy's sincerity.
Let us break meal with our new brothers.
And attempt to settle this.
May the gods bless you...
May the gods bless you...
May the gods bless you...
May the gods bless you...
There's talk among many of us
towards joining his cause.
You knew her?
A foolish girl.
Who spoke too loudly of things she should not have.
The city is filled with ears
straining for whispers of betrayal.
It is filled with eyes as well...
Attempt to leave the city,
and share a cross beside your friend.
I am not your slave.
And I will not bow to your threats.
Nor would I see you.
The oracle of fucking riddles.
Come to plain words.
I saw something in your eyes,
when you stood before Glaber.
I saw something beyond a man weighing decision.
The gods bless you with gift to see into my thoughts now, do they?
More like her will die.
The guilty. The innocent.
There will stand no difference
when caught between Glaber's wrath and Spartacus' vengeance.
And what would you have me do?
Take up offer
and turn on those that I once called brother?
No.
I would have you end the life of Gaius Claudius Glaber.
He is desperate to claim Spartacus' life.
So consumed, that he now stands more threat than the Thracian himself.
And what difference would it make?
Rome would only send another to take his place.
Spartacus blames Glaber for part in his wife's death.
Remove him from the world,
and the scales of blood will be balanced.
Spartacus will drift from Rome.
No more lives will be lost. On either side.
Glaber's own wife,
this very night leaves for Rome.
Taking with her half his personal guard to see her safely from the city.
I could distract any that remain posted to the villa entry,
giving opportunity for a single man
to take Glabe's life while he sleeps.
And Spartacus to receive the blame.
You have lost mind.
The whole world has slipped from reason.
I seek only to restore it.
Rid yourself of Ashur's man.
When moon stands highest I will see path cleared.
Choose to set upon it.
Or see legions fall to pointless suffering.
Your people, they lift spirit.
Not all are so moved.
Perhaps they'll kill each other,
and give proper cause for celebration.
You are an impossible man.
Something thing you've always known.
And chose to ignore.
To better see the man beneath his faults...?
Sing with me, my dark brother!
Share my woman.
I know not your words.
Lugo will teach!
Oenomaus finds himself assaulted.
They are a boisterous people.
Sometimes wine and foolishness are needed.
To forge stronger bond.
Sing with me!
Now is not the time for such things.
Is it ever?
No.
I will try and wrest a drink from Lugo for us to share.
And in the act, aid Oenomaus in escape.
I tried to convince him to let you come.
He would not be moved.
It is a thing of no matter.
What you have done for me...
Would that we were never parted.
You shall find me again to your arms.
Sooner than expected.
I sway Gannicus to forever remove Gaius from concern.
When it is done I will raise clamor,
and see Gannicus follow to the afterlife.
Ilithyia.
It's time.
Gaius --
You shall be missed.
Wine.
We share.
Gratitude, but Crixus awaits.
The Gaul, yes.
I see his eyes.
At me.
No love.
He needs time.
And drink.
I'll tell him.
Tell him his eyes I not like.
Your eyes better...
Let me pass.
Crixus.
Sedullus.
Sedullus.
Calm yourselves!
Spartacus!
Enough!
Is this what you are?
Animals,
demanding slaughter?
We give you freedom.
And you repay it with blood and dishonor.
If you can not stand among us as trusted brother
if you can not follow my orders
take leave now.
Or join Sedullus in death.
I follow Spartacus.
And call no man my kin that does not stand so.
The man that kills Sedullus
is great warrior.
And Lugo follow.
Praetor, pressing concer.
Gannicus has made his decision.
