for over a century ,
i have lived in secret until now .
i know the risk .
but i have to know her .
elena ... she &apos;s a dead ringer for katherine .
i want you all to myself .
just as he wants me ,
but i &apos;m the one who gets to make all the rules .
go get the sheriff . we have a vampire .
no . don &apos;t take her !
you &apos;ll be killed along with them .
just let me be killed .
damon , we &apos;ll get her back .
don &apos;t you think that you &apos;ve done enough ?
stefan &apos;s still drinking human blood .
stefan !
stefan .
blood brings out what &apos;s inside of me .
i &apos;m not gonna give up on you , stefan .
i believe in you .
stop ! stop !
stop ! i &apos;m so sorry .
it &apos;s ok . you &apos;re gonna be ok .
we have to get to the church . they &apos;re waiting .
circle around that way . i &apos;ll distract them .
go .
over here !
there &apos;s another one ! quick !
help me !
arm yourselves .
we don &apos;t have long .
katherine .
katherine .
we &apos;re gonna get you out of here .
damon , hurry . hurry .
no !
no .
damon .
come on . let &apos;s go .
stefan .
stefan .
i love you , stefan .
it &apos;s so hard to see him locked up like this .
you &apos;re the one who locked him up .
you helped .
i couldn &apos;t have him running around chewing on people
while the town was looking for vampires , now , could i ?
it had nothing to do with you actually caring about him .
your thing , not mine .
katherine had me make that for you weeks ago .
where am i ?
the quarry just north of town .
my brother and i brought you here last night .
we found you dead in the woods .
where &apos;s damon ?
am i ... am i a ...
not yet .
you &apos;re in transition .
but how ? i ...
you had katherine &apos;s blood in your system when you died .
no . i never ...
she &apos;s been compelling you to drink it for weeks , stefan .
and damon ?
no compulsion was necessary .
he drank from her willingly .
i woke up last night . i didn &apos;t know where i was .
i went to the church .
and i watched them drag her inside .
then they set fire to it .
and the whole church went up into flames .
they killed her , stefan .
she &apos;s gone .
did you ever figure out what that is ?
nope . whatever it is , it doesn &apos;t work .
pearl didn &apos;t say anything else about it ?
she thought she was stealing his vampire compass ,
but it was a pocket watch .
that johnathan gilbert was a crazy scientist .
have you spoken to your uncle lately ?
i &apos;ve been avoiding him , actually .
that ... and i &apos;ve been here most nights .
so , you &apos;ll be here again tonight ?
is that a problem ?
yes .
you &apos;re a complete nuisance .
heh . see you later .
hey . surprise .
what are you doing here ?
picking up this .
a class schedule ?
starting tomorrow , i &apos;m officially a student here .
you &apos;re kidding me , right ?
no . i finally beat my mom down .
but why would you want to go to high school ?
it blows .
do i really need to answer that ?
you &apos;d suffer through all this just to hang out with me ?
yeah .
i would .
that &apos;s , um ...
stupid ? pathetic ?
old lurky me ?
it &apos;s awesome .
it &apos;s awesome .
brought you something to eat ...
100 % stefan diet approved .
you know what will happen if you don &apos;t eat .
you gonna all rotting and crusty .
i &apos;m not hungry .
of course you are .
we &apos;re eternally hungry . take it .
the human blood should be gone by now .
you want to explain why you &apos;re still in here
feeling sorry for yourself ?
come on . drink up .
fine . starve .
what do i care ?
hello ?
hey , it &apos;s alaric saltzman .
before i hang up , how did you get this number ?
ah , it &apos;s a mystery . listen ,
i &apos;ve , uh , been doing some digging on elena &apos;s uncle .
you interested ?
what kind of digging ?
i &apos;ve got an old friend from duke
who studied criminology when we were there together .
let &apos;s just say he &apos;s become a very proficient digger .
well , did him find anything ?
well , i had him run a track on john &apos;s cell records .
he was getting a call from a number ...
the same number that elena dialed to get isobel .
and then the number was disconnected .
isobel knows john . whatever . we knew that .
right . well , after that ,
he started getting calls from a new number .
and i had my friend run a geo track .
got the address . it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s an apartment in grove hill .
isobel &apos;s in grove hill ?
i don &apos;t know .
i thought we could take a look and see what we find .
perfect . give me the address .
oh , so you can go without me ? no . i don &apos;t think so .
i &apos;m not going with you . you tried to kill me .
yeah , well , you did kill me .
hold on . what ?
i &apos;m just grabbing some clothes , and then i &apos;ll be right over .
how &apos;s stefan ?
extra broody .
hold on .
you drive . pick me up in an hour .
done .
he won &apos;t eat anything .
he has to eat , what &apos;s his favorite ... kind of , um ...
his favorite kind of what ?
type of animal blood that he prefers ?
ew . gross .
your joking doesn &apos;help .
helps me . now , hurry up .
i can &apos;t baby @-@ sit all night . i have things to do .
i would say , &quot; drop dead , &quot; but ...
stefan likes ...
puppy blood ...
little golden retriever puppies with cute , fluffy ears .
that &apos;s his favorite .
sorry .
uncle john .
i didn &apos;t see you there .
i thought we could talk . we haven &apos;t had a chance to catch up .
i &apos;m actually just heading out , so ...
well , it won &apos;t take long .
what did you want to talk about ?
i know you know .
know what ?
it &apos;s really silly to keep pretending .
what do you think your mother would say
if she knew you were dating a vampire ?
which mother ?
i bet johnathan gilbert has told father by now .
wonder how he took the news that we &apos;re dead .
as if he cares . he betrayed us .
he thought he was protecting us , damon .
he thought he was protecting this town .
this sun hurts my eyes .
it &apos;s part of it .
the muscle aches , the sick feeling ...
emily says it &apos;s our bodies pushing us to feed ,
to complete the transition .
that &apos;s not gonna happen .
is that your choice , then ?
to die instead ?
isn &apos;t it yours ?
this was all to be with katherine .
but she &apos;s gone .
i want it over .
how you feelin &apos; ?
damon says you need to drink that .
you need it , stefan .
can &apos;t survive without it .
i don &apos;t want to survive .
what ?
no , don &apos;t say that .
i &apos;m sorry , elena .
no more .
after wh i &apos;ve done , it has to end .
i just want it over .
he &apos;s just being dramatic .
he &apos;s not gonna starve himself .
why would he say that ?
he feels bad about hurting that girl .
it &apos;s very typical stefan martyr stuff .
it will pass .
will it ?
because he seemed to be in lot of pain .
yeah . well , that will pass , too , once he eats .
i didn &apos;t mean physical pain .
i know what you meant .
look , are you gonna be ok here if i have to run out ?
i have to go to an errand with the teacher .
the teacher ?
alaric ? are you two friends now ?
i don &apos;t have any friends , elena .
right .
you should , um ,
you should stay up here . you shouldn &apos;t be down there by yourself .
i &apos;ll be fine .
you know ...
you &apos;re very trusting of him , given the circumstances .
so are you .
otherwise , you wouldn &apos;t be leaving .
it won &apos;t be long .
hello , mr. gilbert .
pearl . what a pleasure .
i must admit , i &apos;m surprised that you came .
jenna tells me that you wanted to discuss
the sale of the building in person .
still , revealing yourself to me like this , it took quite a risk .
i &apos;m not stupid , mr. gilbert .
you knew who i was when you requested the meeting .
so , damon tells me that you &apos;re looking for the device
i took from johnathan .
i &apos;m sure you realize i have no intention of giving it to you .
that &apos;s why i wanted to meet you .
i &apos;m planning on changing your mind .
really ? how so ?
with my gilbert charm .
i know that you have a weakness for it .
may i buy you a drink ?
so , your mother was in love with johnhan gilbert ,
and he betrayed her ?
yup .
and now my uncle john
wants this invention @-@ device thing
that she gave to damon .
that &apos;s pretty much it .
john mentioned there were more gilbert journals .
i bet that &apos;s how he knows everything .
do we have to talk about this all night ?
i &apos;ve told you everything .
i probably shouldn &apos;t have ,
&apos;cause that could get us both in a lot of trouble .
i &apos;m not gonna say anything .
your uncle john wants us dead .
oh , you don &apos;t know that .
yes , i do .
he &apos;s a hater , jeremy .
well , i &apos;m not .
no .
you &apos;re something else entirely .
oh , yeah ? what would that be ?
my weakness .
i don &apos;t want jenna to walk in on us .
jenna &apos;s in the kitchen .
she just opened the refrigerator .
wait . you can hear that ?
that is so cool .
this is the one here .
the records show this was paid 3 months in advance .
this is where it gets tricky .
i may or may not be able to get in .
yeah , how does that work ? you always have to be invited in ?
by the owner or the person of entitlement .
short @-@ term rentals and hotels are a bit a gray area .
you kind of gotta play it by ear .
could we not kill anyone tonight , please ?
you mean , you just brought me along for my company ?
it doesn &apos;t look like anyone &apos;s home .
yeah . i &apos;m good .
no permanent resident , apparently .
uh , ric , we have company .
boys , boys , that &apos;s enough .
i know you .
damon ?
your name is henry . you were in the tomb .
yes , sir .
what are you doing here ?
may i offer you a drink , mr. gilbert ?
thank you , mr. salvatore .
this won &apos;t take much longer .
i want to make sure the founder &apos;s archives are accurate .
be sure you document the loss of civilian life in the church .
they were hardly civilians , mr. salvatore .
as far as anyone needs to know , they were .
as the record keeper for the council ,
what you write will be passed down through generations .
certain details should be kept only between you and me .
for example ?
my sons .
they will be remembered the innocent
victims of the battle of willow creek ,
not for their shame .
certainly , mr. salvatore .
you know , damon hasn &apos;t fed me vervain in a while .
i could be at those bars in flash , and you &apos;d be dead .
yeah , you could .
but you won &apos;t .
please just go away .
i don &apos;t want you here .
what are you doing ?
get out of here .
no .
you &apos;re taking a stupid risk . i could hurt you .
then i &apos;m stupid .
you need to drink this .
elena , get out of here , or you &apos;ll regret it .
drink .
i said get out !
no .
so , how do you know john gilbert ?
well , i &apos;ve known him for years .
he &apos;s a good friend . how do you know him ?
i met him right after i got out of the tomb .
he &apos;s been helping me out .
helping you out how ?
adapting . it &apos;s a whole new world ...
cars , computers , match.com.
there &apos;s so much to learn . he helped me get this place .
so , do you live here alone ,
or is there someone else here ?
that &apos;s my friend &apos;s very ... passive @-@ aggressive way of asking ,
uh , do you know a woman named isobel ?
uh , no . no , i don &apos;t know an isobel .
i know john . he &apos;s my only real friend .
he really showed me the ropes ... how to use a microwave ,
separate my whites .
what else do you do for him ?
i help keep an eye on things ... you know , with the others .
the others ?
from the tomb .
they &apos;re still pissed at the founding families
for trying to burn them alive .
i &apos;m cool ,
but those tomb boys , they want revenge .
what does jonathan want with them ?
he &apos;s just keeping an eye on them , you know ?
trying to make sure they stay out of trouble .
well , that &apos;s john . heh . he &apos;s such a do @-@ gooder .
heh . that &apos;s john now .
oh . hey , let me talk to him .
all right . yeah .
are you gonna answer that ?
am i gonna ... answer that ?
what &apos;s going on ?
&quot; let &apos;s not kill anyone tonight . &quot;
your words . just pointing that out .
my apologies .
no apologies necessary .
so , tell me , mr. gilbert ,
why should i let you have the device ?
because i can help you . i &apos;m connected around here .
the town council &apos;s eating out of my hand . they do whatever i say .
and i know that you just want to live your life
complete with a white picket fence , and i can help you do that .
but the device doesn &apos;t work . why would you even want it ?
it &apos;s a family heirloom . call me sentimental .
johnathan was ahead of his time .
i read his journals . they &apos;re very extensive .
he actually wrote about you .
you were his one regret .
he loved you ,
and he hated himself for what he did to you .
you are lying .
no .
on his last days , he wrote how sorry he was .
you were the only woman he ever loved .
good god .
you vampires ... you &apos;re so emotional .
johnathan gilbert hated you .
his only regret was that he didn &apos;t drive
a stake through your heart himself .
i gave it to damon .
what ?
i gave your device to damon .
why don &apos;t you ask him for it yourself ?
i &apos;m sure he &apos;d be delighted to give it to you .
and then , mr. gilbert ,
may you rot in hell .
talk to me , stefan .
why are you doing this ?
i &apos;m making the decision i should have made years ago .
what are you talking about ?
you have to feed in order to complete the transition .
i know that .
it was a choice i shouldn &apos;t have made .
dear god .
even in our death , you only feel shame ?
you &apos;re one of them now .
no .
father , i came to say good @-@ bye .
i watched you die .
you were there when we were shot ?
i pulled the trigger myself .
you killed your own sons ?
you were both dead to me
the moment you sided with the vampires .
i only thank god that your mother isn &apos;t
alive to see the disgrace you &apos;ve become .
i haven &apos;t turned yet . i don &apos;t want to .
i &apos;m going to let myself die , father . please .
yes , you are .
father , i didn &apos;t mean to .
get away from me .
no , let me help you . please .
oh , god . what &apos;s happening to me ?
how can you even look at me right now ?
you need to be able talk about these things , stefan .
i need to hear them .
come upstairs .
we can talk about it more ,
and we &apos;ll keep talking as long as you need .
you &apos;re so sure i &apos;m ready .
and when you feel the same way ...
i &apos;ll be upstairs .
find anything yet ?
no , i looked everywhere . the place is ...
the place is clean .
well , i found this behind the blood in the fridge .
oh , man , this was a real dead @-@ end .
i wouldn &apos;t beat myself up over it , man .
what did you think you were gonna find , huh ?
isobel with a cigar and slippers ?
oh , man . i ...
i gotta stop this .
i can &apos;t ... i can &apos;t keep searching for her .
really ? after only 2 years ?
that &apos;s actually ...
moderately healthy .
what are you going on ? 146 ?
well , i figured the 200 mark is probably a good stopping point .
i mean , no answer is enough .
i keep thinking i wanna know why ,
when , you know , the precise moment
when my wife decided life with me wasn &apos;t enough .
she charmed me , your wife isobel .
she talked a good game , man .
she was smart . she had this excitement in her eyes .
i probably should have known there
was something different about her ,
some tie to katherine .
there had to be some reason i didn &apos;t kill her .
that &apos;s enough , damon . i don &apos;t wanna hear anymore .
i just don &apos;t want to waste any more of my life
searching for answers that i really don &apos;t want .
i &apos;m through with isobel . i ...
i &apos;m done with all of this .
what &apos;s the matter ?
i need you to pack your things . we &apos;re leaving .
what ? no .
i was wrong to think that we could make a home here .
it &apos;s time for us to move on .
but i don &apos;t want to move on . i want to stay .
we can &apos;t stay .
there &apos;s too many people here who know the truth ...
too much history .
so , what , you &apos;re just gonna give up ,
pack us up , and move us out ?
it &apos;s not safe here . you know that .
please .
this is about jeremy .
no . it &apos;s about me
finally getting to build a life for myself .
please , mama .
you gave me my life back .
i am just trying to protect yours .
i can &apos;t force you .
it &apos;s your decision .
ugh . god . you &apos;re still here ?
were you expecting anything else ?
no .
so , how was the &quot; errand &quot; ?
futile .
although , i think i witnessed the teacher having
an existential crisis
has stefan eaten yet ?
i thought you didn &apos;t care .
chalk it up to morbid curiosity .
i think he &apos;s getting there .
but he &apos;s got a lot of guilt that he has to deal with .
and it doesn &apos;t help that you &apos;ve spent the last 145 years
punishing him for katherine getting caught .
this is my fault now ?
no , it &apos;s no one &apos;s fault , damon .
i &apos;m just ... saying you &apos;re not exactly innocent .
you &apos;ve made it your life &apos;s mission to make him miserable .
let me ask you a question .
in all this important soul @-@ searching
and cleansing of the demons of stefan &apos;s past ,
did you ever manage to get the rest of the story ?
he said there was more .
yeah . that &apos;s an understatement .
damon ...
damon .
tell me .
what are you doing ? who is that ?
i brought her for you .
she &apos;s a gift . have a seat , please .
what have you done , stefan ?
damon , i &apos;ve been to see father .
he came at me .
i didn &apos;t know my own strength . there was blood everywhere .
he was dying , and the blood was too strong .
i needed it . i had to have it .
you fed .
yes . and it &apos;s incredible .
my body is exploding with power , damon .
no .
i can hear things from far away .
i can see through the darkness . i can move , like it &apos;s magic .
and the guilt , the pain ... damon ,
i can turn it off like a switch .
katherine was right . it &apos;s a whole nother world out there , damon .
katherine is dead , stefan .
there &apos;s no world without her .
no .
you can turn that off , too .
you don &apos;t have to feel that pain anymore .
i don &apos;t want it .
you &apos;re weak . you &apos;ll be dead soon .
you need this .
you &apos;ll die .
no . i can &apos;t .
please .
i won &apos;t let you die .
no . i can &apos;t .
don &apos;t fight it .
we can do this ... together .
from the moment stefan had his first taste of human blood ,
he was a different person .
i suppose i should thank him .
it &apos;s been a hell of a ride . heh .
oh , my god . he said he wanted to die .
that &apos;s why he won &apos;t feed . now i understand why , but ...
his choice .
if he &apos;s stupid enough to make it , so be it .
don &apos;t do that . ok ? don &apos;t pretend like you don &apos;t care .
where are you going ?
it &apos;s getting impossible to sneak up on you .
nice try , though .
sorry i woke you .
that &apos;s ok .
you only woke me halfway .
so , listen . i ...
that feels good .
good @-@ bye .
how do you feel ?
you were right .
it is a whole new world .
we can explore it together .
you got what you wanted ... you and me for all eternity .
but here it is , brother .
i will make it an eternity
of misery for you .
damon !
you &apos;ve transitioned .
you &apos;d have rather found me dead ?
katherine saved my life once . i owed her .
that doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;d wish her curse on anyone
it feels more like a gift
that will change .
why is that ?
because even in death ,
your heart is pure , stefan .
i sense that about you .
that will be your curse .
emily , wait .
stefan .
damon told me the rest of the story .
i thought i might find you here .
i should have died that night ,
just like i had chosen .
i should have let damon die , too .
but you didn &apos;t . and if you die now ,
it &apos;s not gonna change what happened .
every single person that &apos;s been hurt ...
every single life that &apos;s been lost ,
it &apos;s because of me .
the night that my parents died ...
i blew off family night so that
i could go off to some party .
i ended up getting stranded ,
and they had to come pick me up .
that &apos;s why we ended up in the car at wickery bridge .
and that &apos;s why they died .
our actions are what set things in motion .
but we have to live with that .
i made a choice , elena .
and because of that choice , a lot of people were hurt .
you also made a choice to stop ,
to reject the person that the blood made you .
you made a choice to be good , stefan .
no . please don &apos;t do that .
that &apos;s the person
who jumped in the water to save the family
whose car had driven off the bridge .
please .
don &apos;t make this all ok .
that &apos;s the person who saved my life .
you don &apos;t understand , elena .
then tell me .
it hurts me .
it hurts me , knowing what i &apos;ve done ,
and that pain ... that pain is with me all the time .
and every day , i think that if i just ..
if just give myself over to the blood ,
i can make that pain stop .
it would be that easy , and every day , i fight that .
and i am so terrified that one day ,
i &apos;m not gonna want to fight that anymore , elena .
and the next time i hurt somebody ...
it could be you .
there will be no next time .
you don &apos;t know that .
maybe i don &apos;t .
but what i do know
is that you can take this ,
throw it in the quarry , and let the sun rise .
or you could take this ring and put it on ,
and keep fighting .
it &apos;s your choice .
elena .
thank you , harper .
you &apos;re welcome
annabelle should be back in a minute .
you know , you don &apos;t have to come with us
if you don &apos;t want to .
this was never my home , ms pearl .
i was just a soldier who was left to die .
you saved me . i &apos;m coming with you .
let me help you with these .
i &apos;ll be upstairs , ok ?
ok .
good night , damon .
thank you .
no , stefan , thank you .
you &apos;re back on bambi blood ,
and i &apos;m the big badass brother again .
all is right in the world .
i mean it . thank you .
for ... helping her take care of me .
you brood too much .
everything on this planet is not your fault .
my actions , what i do , it &apos;s not your fault .
i own them . they belong to me .
you are not allowed to feel my guilt .
do you feel guilt ?
if i wanted to , it &apos;s there .
emily waited till after i turned to tell me
she &apos;d been successful in protecting katherine with her spell .
she didn &apos;t want me to know about the tomb .
she thought it would impact my decision .
she didn &apos;t want either one of us to turn .
she said it was a curse .
witches ... judgy little things .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
&apos;cause i didn &apos;t want you to know .
&apos;cause i hated you , and i still do .
i know .
but not because you forced me to turn .
then why ?
because she turned you .
it was just supposed to be me , stefan ...
just me .
i &apos;m back .
mom ! mama !
please don &apos;t leave me again .
no . please wake up . you have to wake up .
no .
sheriff forbes , it &apos;s john gilbert .
sorry to call so late .
i have an update about the vampires .
hello , ric .
