since the dawn of time , mothers and daughters have always fought .
10 : 00 is an embarrassing curfew .
oh , it &apos;s embarrassing to tell your girlfriends
you &apos;d like to hang out at a safer time ?
a lot .
absolutely not .
doesn &apos;t matter what the topic is ,
they &apos;ll find a way to disagree strongly and dramatically .
and when that runs its course ,
they &apos;ll just lob insults at each other .
this house sucks !
it became the background noise of our lives .
and soon , it became weird when they weren &apos;t fighting .
there &apos;s nothing wrong with this outfit .
they keep it very hot in the gym .
it was a vicious , never @-@ ending war .
all we knew was to keep
our heads low and out of the line of fire .
you &apos;re not going .
but everyone is going !
in a nutshell , all of their fights
boiled down to one thing .
ugh ! why can &apos;t you ever just trust me ? !
i do trust you !
she didn &apos;t .
and to be fair , she didn &apos;t have any reason to .
no , lainey , it &apos;s not hard to get wine coolers .
we &apos;ll just stand outside the liquor store
and target the creepy old dudes .
no !
mom ?
i picked up the phone by accident ,
but i heard everything .
and then came the thing she lived to say .
i &apos;m not mad , i &apos;m just ... disappointed .
erica was smart and sneaky in her own right ,
so my mom had to bring her &quot; a &quot; game .
she read her diary ...
and when she realized it was just a decoy
planted there for her to read ,
she &apos;d find her real diary .
and she wasn &apos;t afraid to get down and dirty
to find out what was going on even when nothing was going on .
no , you &apos;re still conjugating it wrong .
it &apos;s j &apos;aime danser .
what &apos;s that sound ?
i think it &apos;s ... snoring .
seriously ?
nope .
i mean , if you &apos;re gonna spy , at least try to stay awake .
well , in my defense , that was very boring .
it was february 6 , 1980 @-@ something ,
and while erica was my mother &apos;s main focus ,
she still had time to aggravate barry , too .
i &apos;m not exaggerating !
this is literally the worst decision
any parent has made on this planet
and any other planet capable of sustaining life .
you &apos;re not having a girl in your room , end of argument .
lexy bloom is just my lab partner .
all we &apos;re gonna do is study . we &apos;re just friends .
okay . then you can study right here at the table .
here ?
how am i supposed to impress her
with dad strolling around in his underpants ?
aha ! you are trying to get romantic with her .
of course i am !
romance pumps in my veins .
haven &apos;t you heard my rap ballad
about stone @-@ cold grooving with a chick on a ferris wheel ?
i have .
it was wonderful .
not changing my mind .
this is such controversial bullcrap !
adam has emmy mirsky in his room right now !
oh , please .
emmy mirsky doesn &apos;t count .
they &apos;ve been inseparable since they were in diapers .
he calls her muscles .
they &apos;re like brother and sister .
really ?
&apos;cause if you ask me ,
that friendship is hardly as innocent as we think .
ha ! busted !
wait .
what are you doing ?
it rained so we got worms , and now we &apos;re trying to see
who can keep them on their face the longest
without freaking out .
well , that &apos;s sweet , guys .
we &apos;ll give you some privacy .
ugh ! not fair !
what the hell was that about ?
something insane . i don &apos;t even question it anymore .
i &apos;ve got to get these things off my face !
yes ! i win . you know what that means .
ow ! you punched me in my allergy shot .
yep . this was my friend emmy mirsky .
she was a goofball and my wingman ...
or maybe i was hers .
&quot; top gun &quot; five .
later , goose !
whoa . i &apos;m not goose . you &apos;re goose .
i &apos;m maverick .
uh , wrong .
i &apos;m maverick because i look super @-@ cool in aviator glasses ,
which you can &apos;t wear because of your hilarious lazy eye .
my mom says i can get prescription shades ,
so you can suck it !
bead curtains .
that alone should have been enough to get me to turn around .
hey . re @-@ dim that mood lighting .
what are you doing ?
trying to make it romantic in here ,
like a french boudoir or lee majors &apos; hot tub .
why ?
&apos;cause lexy bloom
can &apos;t step one foot into my room
even though emmy sleeps over in your room
whenever her parents go out of town .
that &apos;s &apos; cause emmy &apos;s not really a girl .
she &apos;s like a sibling except i like her .
please .
it &apos;s just a matter of time before you two are making out .
gross !
we &apos;re just friends .
dude , you &apos;re so clueless .
men and women can &apos;t be friends .
that &apos;s a fact . it &apos;s in the encyclopedia .
look it up .
why can &apos;t we be friends ?
a little thing called sexual tension .
you and emmy will happen .
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
i have to finish setting the mood before lexy arrives .
whale sounds .
ladies can &apos;t resist their haunting song .
look it up .
i think you need a new encyclopedia .
well , that was the most humiliating thing
i &apos;ve ever been through in my life .
i &apos;m the one who &apos;s humiliated .
you weren &apos;t sneaky at all . everyone saw you , mom .
saw me doing what ? loving my daughter ?
being a mom ?
hey ! enough !
you two can argue anywhere you like ,
but &quot; that &apos;s incredible ! &quot; is on , and there &apos;s a one @-@ legged model .
i don &apos;t know how she &apos;s gonna walk the runway .
murray , i don &apos;t want to hear
about your stupid tv show right now .
stupid ? !
is it stupid that a baby can water ski ?
is it stupid that someone taught rats to play basketball ?
no , that &apos;s not stupid .
no , that &apos;s incredible !
i &apos;ll tell you what &apos;s stupid .
i can &apos;t go anywhere without my mother trying to ruin my life .
all i was doing was shopping at the same mall as you .
all of a sudden , that &apos;s a capital crime ?
why are you always following me ?
i mean , what , exactly , do you think i &apos;m up to ?
i don &apos;t know . that &apos;s why i was following you .
so , you admit it !
enough !
you two have to work out your crap
because it &apos;s exhausting .
dad &apos;s right .
i &apos;m heading off to college in two years .
do you really want to leave it like this ?
of course not .
then please just back off .
i need space !
i need ... trust .
fine .
and she meant it ...
until the next time my sister left the house .
she went directly to the real diary ,
and what she read would shake her to her very core .
crack rock !
crack rock !
erica &apos;s gonna take crack rocks .
erica what ?
i read it in her diary --
not the decoy , but the real one .
her friends are participating in crack rock ,
and now erica is also going to participate in crack rock .
can &apos;t you just trust erica enough
to know that she &apos;s not gonna go out
and eat crack with her friends ?
no !
if my little baby so much as touches one piece of crack ,
then i have failed as a mother .
you usually say that for dramatic effect ,
but i agree with you on this one .
hey . what &apos;s for dinner ?
dinner . yes .
funny you should ask that .
um , come over here .
come sit next to mama , baby .
are you crying ?
no .
i hope you &apos;re hungry &apos; cause , uh , we are just gonna sit ,
have a little chat .
oh , look . look what i have .
do you know what this is ?
an egg .
this is your brain .
this is drugs .
this is your brain on drugs .
any questions ?
yeah , quite a few .
uh , what the hell is happening ?
listen .
your father and i have good reason
to believe that something is going to --
murray .
what ?
that is a brain . that &apos;s not food .
and you -- i know everything
&apos;cause i read your real diary .
well , there &apos;s one thing you don &apos;t know .
i only wrote that as a trap .
you wrote fake stuff in your real diary ?
yes , because i knew you would read it ,
and i wanted to prove that you are incapable of trusting me .
here &apos;s an idea .
don &apos;t write your feelings down .
shove them down into your body and forget about them like i do .
there &apos;s no downside .
you &apos;re not really gonna try the crack rock ?
of course not !
and the fact that you thought i would tells me everything .
wait , honey .
please don &apos;t be mad at me .
i &apos;m not mad , just disappointed .
it had been a day since barry told me
men and women can &apos;t be friends .
even though i knew he was wrong ,
i still found myself feeling kind of weird around emmy .
dude , you died already ?
what &apos;s the matter with you ?
you play solo .
i &apos;m not in the mood for &quot; contra . &quot;
i &apos;m gonna go grab a tastykake .
you want one ?
bring the whole box .
pops !
oh , thank god . i need you , man .
really bad .
ah , i know that desperate cry for help .
lady trouble ?
no .
yes . i don &apos;t know .
so , then , yes .
okay . here &apos;s my question .
can men and women be friends ?
oh , boy .
i thought you were gonna ask me
how to unhook a bra or something .
i &apos;m all messed up .
barry said emmy and i have sexual tension .
i don &apos;t know what that is ,
but i think i got it , and now things are totally weird .
you and muscles mirsky ?
you two are lifelong buds .
there &apos;s no way .
you sure ?
of course .
men and women can be friends .
take me . i got plenty --
gloria and sheila and mabel .
wait .
aren &apos;t all of those your ex @-@ girlfriends ?
oh , yeah .
well , they started out as friends , but i guess ... wait .
rose boykin . she &apos;s a friend .
so , you never once kissed her .
once .
maybe twice .
maybe a lot more .
none of this helps me at all .
it &apos;s not my fault .
women love me !
here .
let me show you how to do the bra thing .
just name one female friend -- one .
forget me .
i &apos;m a lost cause .
but you love movies , right ?
go watch &quot; when harry met sally . &quot;
it &apos;s all about how men and women can be friends .
i took pops &apos; advice , and that night
we rented a movie about two besties like us .
oh , my god !
oh , my god !
unfortunately , pops hadn &apos;t quite remembered how it ended .
i have to go home now .
this is your home .
then you have to go home now .
yes , things were awkward in our house that week ,
and not just between me and emmy .
after my mom had accused erica of participating in crack rock ,
tension in our house was as thick as the ketchup
my mom was bathing our meatloaf in .
all right , that &apos;s enough . you &apos;ve made your point .
i screwed up .
but i promise from now on , i will respect your privacy for real .
no more listening through the vent ?
no more .
no more reading my diary ?
wouldn &apos;t dream of it .
i &apos;m going to the movies tonight with lainey .
can you trust me ?
i can trust you
if you can promise me that you can be trustworthy .
i promise .
i &apos;m worthy of your trust .
i can &apos;t believe my mom trusted me !
toga ! toga !
no , d @-@ don &apos;t do that .
as erica was finally gonna live it up , i was breaking down .
harry and sally are lovers !
i &apos;m pretty sure you &apos;re wrong about that .
emmy and i just watched it .
and ?
they end up together ,
sucking on each other &apos;s faces like moray eels .
you know , come to think of it ,
i saw that movie with my friend miriam , and ...
we just might have left early to ...
well , you don &apos;t need to know why we left early .
what do i do now ?
how do i get things back to normal with emmy ?
you can &apos;t . the horse is out of the barn .
what horse ?
the horse that goes by the name of sexual tension .
and there &apos;s only one way to ease that tension .
by remaining friends and not addressing it ?
you got to kiss her , see if there &apos;s sparks .
me and lexy bloom are dealing with the same issue .
it &apos;s been tough . i &apos;m not gonna lie .
what are you talking about ?
she didn &apos;t even show up yesterday .
yeah , &apos; cause she didn &apos;t trust herself around me .
well , it &apos;s different with me and emmy .
pops , tell him he &apos;s nuts .
kiddo , you just got to follow your heart .
what does that mean ?
tell me .
do i kiss her or not ?
i don &apos;t know .
you &apos;ve asked the one question
that men and women have debated since the dawn of time .
nobody knows , nobody on this planet .
i know .
it &apos;s kissing time , bro .
bevy , you promised the girl .
relax . i &apos;m just tidying up .
really ? wow . that &apos;s a big step .
i know . it feels good to finally trust her .
the fact that her sheet is missing from her bed
doesn &apos;t bother me at all .
good .
wait .
what does that have to do with anything ?
nothing .
i may have overheard her
talking about a fraternity toga party over at villanova ,
but i &apos;m sure there &apos;s hundreds of other reasons
she would take a bedsheet to the movies with lainey .
oh , i know .
maybe it was one of those movies
where they ask you to bring a sheet .
those exist , right ?
oh , i see what you &apos;re trying to do .
you want me to suggest that we go out and track her down
so you can still look innocent .
well , it &apos;s not going to work .
your baby girl is at a college frat house
wearing a thin layer of bedding .
holy ...
let &apos;s go !
as much as i hated to admit it , i knew barry was right .
emmy and i had to kiss .
so i put on my best suit and braced myself for the worst .
got your call . what &apos;s the emergency ?
why are you dressed like a game show host ?
please have a seat .
we need to chat .
i came all the way here to chat ?
why do we even have walkie @-@ talkies ?
okay .
i know it &apos;s been weird between us ,
but i know how to fix it .
we got to kiss .
what ?
it &apos;s the only way .
we have to find out if there &apos;s sparks .
there aren &apos;t any sparks .
we don &apos;t know that !
you saw what happened to harry and sally .
we got to do this .
fine .
i &apos;ll give you a stupid kiss for one second .
three seconds .
eyes open .
eyes closed .
lights on .
dimmed .
don &apos;t touch my hair or face .
i &apos;m not gonna touch you . gross .
thank you .
let &apos;s do this .
chiclet ?
all right .
on the count of three .
one ...
two ...
nope ! can &apos;t do it !
we have to , emmy .
it &apos;s the only way to know if we can still be friends .
i already know !
we &apos;re not friends anymore .
you ruined it .
i wasn &apos;t the only one having the worst night of their life .
erica &apos;s toga party --
not as awesome as she thought it would be .
yo .
me ?
yo .
what &apos;s going on with your toga ?
oh , i accidentally took the fitted sheet .
what &apos;s a fitted sheet ?
you know , the sheet at the bottom
with the elastic around it ?
you have two sheets ?
what kind of fancy house do you live in ?
hey , kyle . we need you for the keg stands .
and , no , you &apos;re not invited , dorky high school girl .
i &apos;m not in high school .
oh , really ? name one professor at villanova . go .
professor ... togerman .
yeah . why don &apos;t you take your fitted sheet and run on home ?
how does everyone know about these special sheets ?
lainey .
hey . ox just invited me to his room to see his aquarium .
way to go , high school !
as much as erica hated
that my mom was always in her business ,
at that moment , she sort of wished
beverly was there to save her .
that feeling quickly faded .
mom ? what the hell ?
no , you what the hell .
get in the car right now !
murray , calm down .
just calm down .
erica , get in the car !
so , this is what happens when i trust you , huh ?
guess who &apos;s disappointed now .
if you were gonna guess me , you &apos;d be right .
and this is the reason why i feel the need
to keep such close watch over everything .
are you crying ?
murray , take a walk .
but it &apos;s about to rain .
take a walk .
you know who &apos;s disappointed ?
me .
disappointed !
so , what happened ?
it doesn &apos;t matter .
all i know is that you were right not to trust me .
but i do trust you .
no , you don &apos;t .
i don &apos;t .
you don &apos;t trust me
and i keep doing untrustworthy things
which makes you not trust me , and i &apos;m so tired of it .
when is this gonna be any different ?
probably never .
my mom used to do the same thing to me ,
and i swore i &apos;d never do it to you , but here i am doing it .
but look on the bright side .
one day you &apos;ll have a daughter of your own not to trust .
murray , let &apos;s go .
give me a minute !
some guy &apos;s gonna show me his aquarium .
while my mom was finally mending her relationship with erica ,
i was figuring out how to make up with emmy .
i love that you get cold when it &apos;s 71 degrees out .
i love that it takes you an hour and a half
to order a sandwich .
i love that you get a little crinkle above your nose
when you &apos;re looking at me like i &apos;m nuts .
and it was harry who made me realize
exactly what i had to do .
what do you want ?
come here . we need to talk .
emmy , i &apos;ve been doing a lot of thinking ,
and the thing is , i don &apos;t love you .
you mean it ?
look .
sometimes , you meet a girl
and you just know that she &apos;s the one .
when you act like a wuss ,
she &apos;s the one that punches you hard .
when you find a dead mouse , she &apos;s the one
that helps you hide it under barry &apos;s pillow .
when you put too much confidence in a fart ,
she &apos;s the one that helps you bury your underpants
in the woods behind the school .
she &apos;s your friend .
and you never , ever want to kiss her .
want to go get some worms ?
after that fateful night ,
things got better for all of us goldbergs .
there was a little less fighting ...
... and a little more trust .
why don &apos;t you two go study up in barry &apos;s room ?
there &apos;s less foot traffic .
really ?
yeah , i &apos;m not going up there .
and as for me and emmy ,
to this day , we &apos;re just friends .
keep up , goose .
i &apos;m not goose ! i &apos;m maverick .
sure you are , goose .
emmy mirsky , best friend of adam .
move over !
you &apos;re not gonna show this to anyone ,
so i don &apos;t really care .
how do you know ?
okay . i helped barry make his first music video .
emmy , you &apos;re kind of a girl -- sort of .
you have to honestly tell me what you think .
* hey , girl , you lookin &apos; good up here where the air is *
* you &apos; n &apos; big tasty on a wheel by ferris *
* up and up we go , i know you gonna ask it *
* how we gettin &apos; down from this sexy floatin &apos; basket ? *
* stop at the top , is it just our luck ? *
* or did i tip that carny an extra 14 bucks ? *
* ferris wheel , ferris , ferris wheel *
* you know how i feel *
whale break .
what do you think ?
i &apos;m gonna need 40 copies of this .
yeah , you are !
