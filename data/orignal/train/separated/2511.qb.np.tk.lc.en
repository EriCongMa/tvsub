第二十三季第十九集
monday .
here we go again .
sorry , kid , but there comes a day when
that just doesn &apos;t do anything anymore .
stuck in a rut ? hmm ...
ready for a change ?
we built heaven and made it float .
royalty cruises , one week away from the everyday .
visuals and commercial , if anything , underplay
the thrill of actual cruise experience .
want , want , want , want , want ,
want , want , want , want !
want ! !
mom , dad ...
do you know there &apos;s a boat out there where nothing sucks ?
it &apos;s called royalty cruises ,
and royalty cruise specialists are standing by now !
i &apos;m sorry , sweetie .
maybe we could afford a vacation
if some big shot didn &apos;t pick up the tab
for his buddies at mr. steak .
again with mr. steak ! do you know why i go to mr. steak ?
because at mr. steak , they don &apos;t get mad at me
for ending a lot of money at mr. steak !
well , of course they don &apos;t !
why don &apos;t you talk to mrs. steak ?
there is no mrs. steak !
who could stay married to such a man ?
okay , maybe i can pay for the cruise .
let &apos;s see how much it costs for a cabin on a low deck .
no porthole ... group z lifeboat access ...
aw , it &apos;s still a ton of money .
face it , we &apos;re just kids .
we can &apos;t afford stuff with zeroes in the prices .
all we have in the world are the things our parents give us .
bart ! there &apos;s a really mean squirrel in the backyard .
i need you to dare me to fight him !
bart &apos;s been raptured ! and his crap &apos;s been craptured !
why do you want a box of bart &apos;s baby teeth ?
doctor says i need more calcium ,
and i ain &apos;t &quot; tums rich . &quot;
i sold all my stuff ,
and it &apos;s still not enough money for the cruise .
just try to enjoy your dinner , sweetie .
i can &apos;t , i sold my &quot; dinner futures . &quot;
nice doing business with you , boy .
homer !
it &apos;s okay . i don &apos;t have much of an appetite .
i &apos;m going to floor .
mom ! dad !
i woke up and the money jar was full !
that means the devil accepted my bargain .
now , to uphold my end of the deal !
snowball ii !
no !
we saw how much this cruise means to you ,
so we all sold something special .
and we made just enough for an economy cabin !
i sold a couple of my rare jazz records .
after a while they all start to sound the same .
still love the genre , of course .
not even close to getting sick of it .
and i sold our good china .
really ? !
but that &apos;s been in your family for generations .
actually , my mom stole it from a woman she cleaned for .
took her years to get the whole set .
and dad donated something , too .
what happened to my mini @-@ pool table ? !
i was training to be a mini @-@ pool hustler .
we sold it to pay for a family cruise .
i never even got to realize this jacket was too small .
it &apos;s weird to hear myself saying this , but ...
i love you guys .
this is going to be the best vacation ever !
yeah , for you kids , maybe .
for dads , a family vacation is
a 24 @-@ hour @-@ a @-@ day babysitting job .
&quot; are you wearing enough sun block ? &quot;
&quot; is that splashing or drowning ? &quot;
&quot; why does every sand castle require my participation ? &quot;
then a kid disappears , and it &apos;s total panic
until you find him at the swim @-@ up bar ...
... eating a 30 @-@ dollar cheeseburger ,
which he drops in the water !
and here &apos;s the worst part :
i never get any time alone with my wife
because we &apos;re all sleeping in the same room !
look , that &apos;s our ship !
oh , i &apos;m sorry , sir , but your cruise is overbooked .
what ?
i can offer you a cabin
on our sugar @-@ free fitness cruise .
welcome to eight days and seven nights
of pushups and kale !
well , well , mr. never @-@ wrong was right again :
family vacations always suck .
i called it !
called ... it .
homer , this is bad for you , too .
worth it to be ri @-@ ght !
worth it to be ri @-@ ght !
wait a minute , i can get you back on your original ship ,
but in a different cabin .
upgrade !
i &apos;m sorry , there &apos;s been a mistake .
this isn &apos;t your cabin .
double upgrade ! all right !
i knew it . it was all a dream .
no , honey . you just passed out
when you saw the private bedroom in our triple upgrade !
i actually did it-- a perfect vacation .
you &apos;ll never guess how many bath towels they gave us ...
enough ! whoo ...
and there &apos;s a dvd library of movies
that haven &apos;t been released yet .
greetings , cruisers !
i &apos;m your cruise director , rowan priddis ,
and welcome aboard the royalty valhalla ,
where the only rule is &quot; always have fun ! &quot;
your every need will be catered to from our toddler &apos;s club
to &quot; condolences , &quot; our award @-@ winning luxury morgue .
your enjoyment pays my salary ,
so in a sense , each of you is my boss ...
and as my boss ...
i &apos;d like to ask you for a week of vacation .
a week i will spend here on this cruise ,
performing my normal duties as cruise director .
that &apos;s how much i love my job .
bon voyage !
whoa , a &quot; fun schedule &quot; !
there &apos;s so much to do :
laser @-@ tag , waterslide bobsled ...
oh ! ice cream snowball fight starts in five minutes !
homie , we actually have the cabin all to ourselves .
sex on a family vacation ?
i never thought such a thing was possible !
and the ocean will do all of the work .
ocean sex rules !
go to hell , land sex !
kidzone .
let me guess : a broken foosball table
and a game of clue missing its candlestick .
lisa simpson ?
our kidzone pre @-@ screeners have placed you
with our most sophisticated children
&quot; kidzone elite . &quot;
help me study the effects of rising ocean acidity .
no , help me tag and release seabirds .
it &apos;s so diverse .
i &apos;ve died and gone to a pbs kids show !
two ? !
all right , fun schedule , you &apos;re about to get did !
two diplomats &apos; sons are in love with me .
who will i choose : ghana or portugal ?
boy , thanks to you , we &apos;re having fun
&quot; before you were born &quot; fun .
where did the ship stop again ?
i don &apos;t know , a lot of barefoot kids kicking soccer balls ,
shell necklaces ; they really hid the poverty nicely .
anyplace is fun if you &apos;re there with &quot; super lips . &quot;
i &apos;m just glad everyone is having the best week of their lives .
whenever we reach the halfway point of our voyage ,
i like to take a moment to reflect .
hit it , gary ocean and the motion !
* enjoy it while you can *
* ice @-@ sculptures , conga lines , and working on your tan *
* enjoy it while you &apos;re here *
* one week of glitz and glam instead of pain and fear *
* in just a few days &apos; time , this boat pulls into dock *
* and when it does , you lovely people may be in for a shock *
* here you &apos;ve made exciting friends *
* back home , you &apos;ll all lose touch *
* here , hawaiian shirts are cool *
* back home , well , not so much *
* back home , you &apos;ll be to tired for making magic in the sack *
* so , eat buffet , and play and pray *
* there &apos;s some delay on our way back *
* enjoy it while you can *
* here at sea , we drink and frolic *
* back home , that &apos;s called alcoholic *
* your future &apos;s up but parabolic *
* enjoy it while you can . *
bravo !
the song &apos;s right .
no matter how much fun i cram into this cruise ,
it only lasts a week .
then it &apos;s back to mom and dad fighting , lisa moping ,
甲板独白会
homework , bullies and a lunch bag sandwich
soggy with the sweat of a juice box !
after this cruise ,
for the rest of my life , it &apos;s all downhill .
only good week of my life .
why can &apos;t vacation last forever ?
i &apos;ve got to do something .
sorry .
there &apos;s something i see
that &apos;s even more beautiful than ganymede , lisa .
i ... oh .
that &apos;s right , io .
but no moon of jupiter is as beautiful as you .
purple !
this is general william sullivan
with an emergency message .
i &apos;m speaking to you from a cdc clean zone .
outbreak of the deadly pandora virus is spreading rapidly .
unprecedented threat requires a worldwide quarantine .
all ships must remain at sea until further ...
humanity must endure .
a virus ? !
we &apos;re stuck on the ship ? !
what should we do ? !
they &apos;re buying it . they &apos;re buying it .
&quot; chillingly plausible &quot; indeed ,
joe morgenstern of the wall street journal .
now to make sure no one can call home to check ,
with a little help from the make @-@ your @-@ own @-@ sundae bar .
squirt , squirt .
our attempts to contact the mainland
have met with nothing but static .
it appears we have no choice -- to avoid the virus ,
we must remain at sea indefinitely .
oh , no !
we &apos;re stuck here !
vacation forever !
good morning , everyone !
as we greet a sunny day 12 , after virus .
while the world deals with their pandemic ,
we &apos;re having a &quot; fundemic , &quot; under the capable hands
of our norwegian captain svalbard .
i always knew mankind &apos;s hubris would doom us all .
ja , he spoke of it often .
once we reach our exciting
and hopefully virus @-@ free destination ,
romantic antarctica , our activities will include
building shelter , hunting for food
and starting civilization anew .
while supplies may be running a little low ,
not to worry , as today &apos;s delicious buffet
features fresh seagull and hull @-@ scraped barnacles .
in the chuckles comedy club , we have joey scazzazone ,
with his no @-@ longer @-@ observational take
on our pre @-@ virus lives .
hey , so what &apos;s the deal with
how many starbucks there used to be , huh ?
i don &apos;t know why that bothered me so much .
hug your kids .
need a break ?
then don &apos;t check out the sensations luxury spa ,
which is now the stronghold of charismatic cult leader
dave the lifeguard .
mankind was warned not to run near the pool !
mankind did not listen !
the virus is his reward !
so , remember , rule number one is &quot; always have fun , &quot;
because fun is the only thing that will keep us alive .
fun !
worthless , worthless , worthless .
hey , guys , can you believe how awesome this is ?
if it wasn &apos;t for this virus thing ,
we &apos;d all be back at our old sucky lives .
instead , you &apos;re here , where you can be lovey @-@ dovey all the time .
come on , kiss .
kiss !
bart , we &apos;re too worried to enjoy each other &apos;s mouths .
yeah , and the customer service on this cruise
has really gone downhill .
drop dead , fat @-@ ass !
last week , that steward brought me extra shampoo .
he called me &quot; lovely lady . &quot;
hey , lis , at least you nerds are still geekin &apos; it up .
what could be sweeter than a vacation that never ends ?
sweet ? sweet ? !
the passengers on this ship
could be the last people on earth .
like monks during the dark ages ,
it &apos;s up to the kidzone : elite
to make a record of human culture .
this group is adapting children &apos;s classics
for the stage to entertain generations of survivors .
erik , we must work with the humans .
you are so naive , charles .
we should rule them as conquerors .
can &apos;t anybody enjoy their forever vacation ?
check it out ! the gallery was gonna
throw these paintings overboard ,
like they were worthless garbage .
bart , glad you &apos;re here .
we &apos;re all gonna watch a movie together .
yeah , a movie !
it is about time you guys started having some fun .
humanity must endure .
general , it &apos;s worse than we thought .
the virus is getting bigger .
bart , how could you ?
uh , got to go !
man , i kicked butt in the gladiator arena today .
i won the last package of hot dogs on the ship .
i got robbed by marauders on the way home .
there is no virus !
bart faked the whole thing with a dvd .
a direct @-@ to @-@ video dvd .
you stand accused of letting down your team
during music trivia .
your fun @-@ ishment : eight hours in the penal conga line .
excuse me , cruise director priddis .
my son has something to tell you .
speak passenger , son of passenger .
it was all a hoax ; there &apos;s no virus .
but the warning from the general !
that was just treat williams in a virus movie .
you know , i thought that general looked familiar .
what ?
i &apos;m in a lot of movies .
i take back everything i said to you
that night in the dolphin lab .
all that happened is we got a little extra vacation .
is that so bad ?
i think i ate people meat !
i know my son did a terrible thing .
but there &apos;s a chapel on this ship ,
and in that chapel there &apos;s a book ,
and it says , &quot; judge not , lest ye ... &quot;
after this , i &apos;ll be lucky to get work
on a clothing @-@ optional jimmy buffett cruise !
what about the duty @-@ free stuff we bought ?
&quot; never have fun ! &quot;
my booze and cologne !
前方三英里
that &apos;s fair .
sorry .
i deserve it .
ow ! that one really hurt .
sorry , sweetie , i just needed to get that out of my system .
this stupid prank is the most selfish thing you &apos;ve ever done !
i wasn &apos;t being selfish .
i did it for you guys , too .
lisa , you made friends with kids just like you .
mom and dad , you were more happy and in love than i ever saw you .
it was the best week of all of our lives ,
and i wanted it to last forever .
choke on my numb blue hands !
oh ... what the ...
hey , up here !
you got to see this !
from egg to baby to grownup ,
we can see them living
their entire penguin lives from up here .
what a load of crap .
they spend all their time trying to raise a baby , and why ?
so it can grow up and do the same dumb thing ,
on and on forever .
the penguin &apos;s life isn &apos;t all bad .
those ones are having a blast .
but the slide &apos;s just like our cruise :
a short awesome thing that just shows you
how boring the rest of your life is .
well , sure , life is full of pain and drudgery ,
but the trick is to enjoy the few perfect experiences
we &apos;re given in the moment .
yeah , stupid .
stop thinking about fun and have it !
hey , wait for me !
