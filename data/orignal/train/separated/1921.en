"Do You Know?"
Do you know who you are?
Do you know what's happened to you?
Do you want to live this way?
There's a hole in the pericardium.
That's the source of all this blood?
No, that's what's keeping him alive.
Well, hello.
All it takes is one person, one patient, one moment,
to change your life forever.
Ross, I would like to introduce you to...
the black mamba.
It can change your perspective,
color your thinking...
Um... isn't that the IVC?
The single trickiest vessel in the entire human body...
delicate, unpredictable.
Hear that?
The gurgling?
That's its song.
See that?
Look how it twitches.
One wrong move, one misstep,
and this patient is dead.
You can't repair that mamba without moving...
with the mamba.
Some people say it's impossible to repair.
One moment that forces you to re-evaluate
everything you think you know.
Come on, mamba.
Let's dance.
You paged?
MVC victim.
Wanted you to take a look at the C-spine X-rays.
Oh, damn.
Poor guy.
Oh. Hey. I just nailed the mamba.
Do you know who you are?
The patient's c3 and 4 are obliterated.
His spinal cord is severed.
There's no way I can repair that.
Do you know what's happened to you?
But we just fixed his heart.
Against all odds. 'cause I'm awesome.
Yeah, well, even so,
he's lost all motor function from the neck down.
The man's paralyzed.
Do you want to live this way?
Wait. What?
Unfortunately, the impact of the crash
severed his spinal cord at c3,
which is quite high in the neck --
Yeah, no, I'm a nurse. I-I know what c3 is.
So you're saying...
He's paralyzed.
Yes.
I am so sorry.
But his brain function is good,
and I was able to fully repair his heart --
Uh, is his diaphragm working? Can he breathe on his own?
No, he's currently on a ventilator.
There are options from here, once he's had time to recover --
Uh, surgery to fuse his spine so he can sit up.
We can, uh, insert a-a permanent trach.
These are all options we can discuss --
Will he ever breathe on his own again?
No. He will not.
Okay, um...
I need you to wake him up -- right now.
You can do that, right?
Elise, your husband just underwent major surgery.
I know, and now I'm asking you to wake him up.
And I need you to ask him
If he wants you to remove the vent.
Well, the vent is breathing for him.
It's -- it's what's keeping him alive.
I was gonna surprise him tonight.
As an early anniversary gift, I got us playoff tickets.
I mean, nosebleed seats, but we kind of love it up there.
It's like, pretzels and hot dogs for dinner.
I mean, it's fun.
The last thing I thought when I woke up this morning
was I'd lose Jason.
I understand...
what I'm asking.
Believe me, I don't want to lose him.
But...
I know him. I know everything about him.
I understand how he thinks. I get his humor.
I could predict what he's gonna order in a restaurant.
And I just -- I don't think he would want this.
I know it.
I think he would rather die
than live one more minute hooked up to a machine.
It's your husband's right to decline treatment,
if that's what he wants.
Uh, it'll -- it'll take some time
to fully wean him off the sedation,
but I'll let you know when he starts to wake.
Thank you.
I think she really means it.
And that bugs you?
No. I mean, maybe. I don't know.
It's just... I don't know.
It's not like I want to get married tomorrow, but never?
But you're with her.
I-if you love her, who cares if she's not the marrying kind?
I wasn't.
Yeah, but then you did.
Right, but some people don't.
So, what -- we just keep doing what we're doing
for the next 20 years, and that's it?
But if you're together, what does it matter?
Didn't see you there.
You okay?
Yep.
Jason?
My name is Dr. Yang.
I know you must be very confused right now,
but I need to ask you some questions, okay?
There's a tube down your throat, so you can't speak,
but you should be able to nod "Yes" or "No."
Think you can do that for me?
That's great. Okay. Let's get started.
Do you know who you are?
Do you know where you are?
Do you know what's happened to you?
You were in a car accident.
Your vehicle was hit from behind,
and you flipped over into oncoming traffic.
You're in a hospital right now.
Do you know who this is?
Your spine was crushed in the accident,
and you are paralyzed from the neck down.
You're currently breathing with the help of a ventilator.
That's the tube in your mouth.
Now, I understand it might be your wish
for me to remove the vent?
I want to make sure you understand what this means.
The ventilator is breathing for you.
That means, once it's removed,
you will not be able to breathe on your own.
Now, if you can't breathe...
you will die.
It might take a few hours -- probably less.
Do you understand this?
oh, god.
Do you still want me to remove the vent?
I love you.
And I want you to know, whatever you decide...
...I'll support you.
I'll be by your side, no matter what.
I'm sorry, but I have to ask one more time.
Jason,
would you like me to remove the vent?
Do you know who you are?
Do you know what's happened to you?
Do you want to live this way?
Ohh! God!
Hey, you.
What are we doing? What the hell are we doing?
I'm...waiting for an elevator?
I just spent my day
saving the life of a man who's now choosing to die,
And all I keep thinking is...
you and I are throwing so much away.
We should be together.
You're the love of my life, and it is stupid --
Just stupid -- for us to keep pretending.
I love you.
I want to be with you -- for real, forever.
It's as simple as that.
That's it.
We've christened every room in this house.
Yeah.
And it's a pretty big house. Mm-hmm.
I thought I wasn't gonna make it through the guest room.
Yeah, but you rallied at the end. Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm, I did.
You know, the house feels big for just two of us.
Don't you think?
Ah. He is gorgeous.
No.
Okay. Um...
This one.
I agreed to a dog, not a horse.
That's a mid-size dog.
No, that is huge. You know what a big dog makes?
What?
Big poop.
That thing could crap my entire body weight in a day.
Hmm. That is a beautiful image. Thank you.
That one.
What?
That's the one.
No. No. That is not even a dog.
That is a rodent, and it looks mean.
Hey, uh, we want this thing in here.
Can someone get it out?
Conduit, please.
Fresh off the printer.
Kid's tiny for 12 months.
He'll grow when his heart's sending
a little more blood around the system.
The first couple kids we put conduits in,
you can already see the difference in only a year.
Hey, so, I have an emergency surgery.
I'm gonna be in the O.R. for the next nine hours.
Okay.
Mrs. Rodriguez!
Oh, no. This is gonna take me at least three hours.
Well, Mrs. Rodriguez is not gonna make it.
Is she a cardio patient?
I could have somebody page you a consult.
Mrs. Rodriguez will last until I finish here, and then I'll go.
Ross, you'll close for me?
Yeah.
Are you sure?
Well, this is why I said we should keep the damn dog
in the kitchen when we're gone.
I am not locking the dog in the kitchen.
Well, then you can clean up the puddle
on the rug when you get home.
I'll leave it for you!
You got a dog?
Yes.
Thing's gonna be dead in a week.
Wait. You named your dog Mrs. Rodriguez?
When you meet him, you'll understand.
Meet him soon -- before he dies.
What? I'm a physician!
It's not like I'm gonna have trouble keeping an animal alive.
Give 5-0 prolene, please.
What? You think I can't keep a dog alive?
Whatever. Don't worry about it.
He's perfectly healthy.
Alex, it's not funny.
I can't believe
you're gonna dress the dog in my son's sweater.
Mrs. Rodriguez gets cold.
He doesn't have the constitution for all this damp and rain.
He gets the shakes.
What?
You like the dog!
He's an unusual dog.
It's not like I'm becoming someone who likes dogs.
He just happens to relate to people like I do.
It's true.
I mean, he doesn't want to talk about
his feelings or the future.
If I walk him and feed him on a regular schedule,
he'll curl up next to me on the couch,
and if I don't, he'll bite my ankles.
It's a set of behaviors that makes sense to me.
You like the dog.
The dog gets you.
You're alike.
That's how I talk about my children.
You have a baby. Oh!
A dog baby.
Mrs. Rodriguez!
I'm sorry. I know how painful it is.
I've been through it myself,
but it's been over two years since the injury,
and at some point, you just have to say enough is enough.
What? No. Y-you have no idea where --
Hey, look, your hand needs more time, all right?
Just give your hand rest, throw yourself into the rehab.
I've done the rehab! It's been two years!
It's done, okay? I'm good enough to operate.
I mean, what is this? Is this about Mr. Willenstein?
That was a routine -- - The decision has been made.
You can keep your administrative duties,
but you are not cleared to operate.
You're not going back in the O.R.
Any other business before we adjourn?
Actually, uh... yes, there is.
You had to bring it up to the board!
Yeah. It was time.
It absolutely was not time. We didn't make the decision yet.
Well, clearly, I'm wrong, 'cause we did.
I just wasn't part of it.
Listen, it is the job of a lifetime.
Running the entire military trauma division with Teddy --
It's -- it's what's next for me, Cristina.
I can feel it.
Yeah -- in Germany!
We have a house! I have my trial!
We are good here, Owen. We're happy.
We can't just leave everything.
Just listen to me for one second --
No. No. You want to know what?
You're not backing me into this.
Come on. Nobody backs you into anything.
Believe me -- I've tried.
So, you want me to dump my whole trial,
just when I'm starting to get somewh--
That is not what I'm sayi-- please stop.
Stop acting like you're some hit-and-run victim.
I can't have another conversation
where the idea that my career
or, in fact, any of my wishes might come first
is presented as some... crime against humanity!
Oh, what?
So, now we're back where we started?
I never give you anything,
so the terms under which we're together
are that your dreams die?
Can you quiet the damn dog?
You know what? You quiet the damn dog. You wanted the dog.
Not that dog! He doesn't even like me.
He only likes you.
Because you make stupid decisions! And he knows it!
I'm not moving to Germany!
Oh, so, that's it? Conversation's over?
Of course it is.
I don't know why I ever entertained the idea for one second
that we might ever do anything that I'd want.
Coming through!
Dr. Yang!
Oh, whatever it is, it can wait.
My shift is over, and I am going home.
Come on. Patient 11 -- Jasper O'neil.
He's back for his annual checkup.
Apparently, he's learning to play hockey.
You handle it. Send him my best.
But if my conduit gets smashed
because they let their kid get body-checked on the ice,
I'm killing them!
Will do.
Hey, who'd have thunk it?
You and me -- we're belly buddies.
No, we're not.
It's okay. You're almost there.
All you have to do is push.
No. No can do.
We are almost there.
He's gonna have to stay up in there.
I've got a cozy womb. He'll be happier.
It'll be better for everyone.
Oh, my god! Oh, god! Oh, god!
Wait a second. You have to wait a second.
No, I can't!
You have to wait one second.
I can't, I can't.
Oh, god. This is a mistake. It's a mistake!
I can't! I can't!
What?
This is a mistake, Mer!
Everyone says that.
Here we go. We need one more push.
Okay, now!
Push! Push! Push!
Great!
I screwed up, Mer.
Mer, I screwed up. I really screwed up.
I can't --
Hello.
Oh. Go back to sleep. I got this.
Okay.
It's okay. You're doing good. You're being so good.
Yeah. He's fine. He's fine.
This is all my fault. You know, I was -- I was at the park,
and I looked away for a second when Ross texted me.
I was -- I was standing right there.
Listen, it's okay. These things happen.
And have you met our son?
He lunges headfirst into everything.
It's a wonder this never happened sooner.
Well, we can't go back to that park.
They need, like, sand or some of that soft turf stuff.
I mean, who puts concrete steps by a play space?
It's completely irresponsible.
It is a superficial cut. He's gonna be fine.
I'm already late for my meeting.
I can't just -- I can't just stick him in daycare, not when --
Slow down. Slow down, okay?
Now, we're gonna figure this out.
And, by the way, daycare has very capable teachers.
Oh, please. I am capable.
So, your text said "Make sure the phase 3 patients go."
Go to the bathroom? Go away?
Oh. Sorry. I didn't realize. Is he okay?
Yes.
No.
Uh, do you want me to reschedule
the phase 3 patient meetings today,
maybe try to squeeze them in next week, or--
No, just, um...
Ross, will you take them? You understand the procedure.
You know what to do. Just-- I --
you know, I want you to take over phase 3 from here.
What?
What-- are you sure?
Yes. Can you do this for me? Just do this for me, okay?
Of course, if that's what you want.
I can't believe Bailey's already 7.
Please tell me he has outgrown that whole
"I fiddle with my junk 24/7" phase,
'cause I have to practically duct-tape Theo's pants
on his body.
Of all the conversations that you and I have had about boys,
I didn't expect this one to be it.
Feel any kicks yet?
Uh, no, not really.
Nauseous?
Oh, just tired.
Every day, I go to work and do my job.
Then I come home and do that job.
I'm so tired.
It's like I'm sleepwalking all the time.
Well, you're well into your second trimester now,
so that'll start getting better.
It's not the pregnancy.
Cristina...
Look how happy he is.
You're not dressed?
We need to get going.
The Harper Avery Awards await.
Are you... nervous?
Are you okay?
Do you need a minute?
No.
Maybe.
Okay.
But just a minute.
And then nerves of steel.
Right?
Right.
Okay.
The surgical mind needs to be constantly inspired,
always asking the toughest questions.
The Harper Avery Award is a celebration of that,
of the kind of mind I saw in tonight's recipient,
even when he was just an intern.
Ladies and gentlemen, I am honored to present to you
this year's Harper Avery Award recipient
to Dr. Shane Ross.
Thank you. Thank you.
First and foremost, I'd like to thank Dr. Yang.
I wouldn't be here without your guidance,
encouragement, and support.
All it takes is one person,
one patient to change your life forever.
When I first met Jasper O'Neil,
he was 12 months old,
And we didn't think he'd make it to 13.
He's here with us tonight.
Jasper, would you stand up, please?
Cristina. Cristina.
Do you know who you are?
Do you know what's happened to you?
Do you want to live this way?
I love you.
And I want you to know that whatever you decide...
I'll support you.
I'll be by your side...
no matter what.
I'm sorry, but I have to ask one more time.
Jason...
Would you like me to remove the vent?
Son of a--
Hey, you.
I just spent my day saving the life of a man
who could've chosen to die but didn't.
I repaired a heart that was impossible to repair.
I achieved the impossible today, and it feels good.
No. More.
It feels...incredible.
What are you doing right now?
Um... Waiting for the elevator.
Yeah. We're gonna have to take the stairs,
'cause I just finished my shift, and I feel like celebrating...
Tonight...
Naked...
With you.
Oh. I could be into that.
Are you...
sure you're okay with this?
Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm very sure.
No, no.
No, not -- not this.
Us...
Being...
Just us.
I know.
And I'm good.
I am.
You said you were okay. You told me...
Yeah, I know.
You told me that...
I thought I was, okay? But I'm not.
What does that
I just need my films.
Not right this second, though.
Listen, all I am asking
is that we just reopen this conversation -- - No. No!
There is nothing left to talk about.
Owen, I was clear about this.
I was so clear.
I can't give you more than what I am already giving.
And if now you need more --
Yes, I think I do! I think I do! - If now --
Well, then -- then get it somewhere else.
Okay, I will.
It's -- it's over.
No, this time, Owen and I are really over.
I mean, we can't keep falling back into the same pattern.
It's just...
Mer? You awake?
Yeah. You and Owen are over again.
I'm totally listening. Continue.
Well, see? That's the point.
I-it can't continue the way it is.
It's -- it's not good, it's not healthy.
Your heart's healthy enough now
that you'd be an excellent candidate
for the type of research they're doing.
Mm-hmm.
Could it hurt him?
No. It is a surgery.
I would implant an array of wireless sensors into his skull
that would transmit electrical activity.
But none of our subjects ever complained of pain.
It's a chance to help us,
to help revolutionize treatment for people like yourself.
What do you think, hon?
It'll help people -- "people like me..."
It won't help me?
Honey, wouldn't it be nice to have a place to go
instead of sitting around the house all day?
It's something, Jason. It's something we can do.
Please?
I don't care.
Fine.
Um, thank you, Dr. Yang, for thinking of us.
Oh, no, actually, it was Chief Hunt's idea.
He -- he told us about Jason.
Oh, well, thank you, Dr. Hunt.
It's gonna be great for him.
Well, good luck.
What?
That was a really nice thing you did for them.
Oh, well... I'm a really nice guy, or so I've been told.
I would never ask you for that.
You're not asking. I am telling you.
Well...
I don't believe you.
Cristina, people change.
I mean, you're not the same person that you were when we met.
I can change, too.
Really?
People who want kids don't just stop wanting them.
Don't give up things for me.
Hey, I'm not.
I haven't.
I'm not giving up anything.
Good.
Good. Good.
Yeah, slowly but surely.
Just focus on your balance.
How does it feel, Jase, to walk again?
It's...
pretty good.
Yeah, I think he needs to concentrate.
It's amazing, in just a few years?
Unbelievable.
Is Dr.Yang busy?
I would love for her to see this.
I can check, okay?
Jason, are you all right?
Jason!
Get a crash cart!
Jason?
Hey, I need you.
Yes. Uh, no. I can't.
Uh, these abstracts were supposed to go out an hour ago.
You know what? Okay. On-call room, but fast?
No, no, it's not, um -- it's Jason Castor.
He just had an accident in the BCI lab.
He has rhabdo, renal failure.
Grey is putting a shunt in him, but his wife's asking for you.
Jason Castor -- your patient, the quadriplegic?
We, uh, put him into Derek and Callie's trial.
His wife is -- - Oh! Right, right, right. Yes. Um...
Does he need a heart consult?
No, no. She's just scared, and she trusts you --
You know, Owen, I-I have to finish this.
I've got seven prints going.
Where -- where's Ross?
Ross can't do this.
I'm one step away from funding for animal trials.
Owen, he's not my patient anymore.
If the guy's heart is fine,
I don't have time to hold someone's hand right now.
You know what? You saved her husband's life.
You were the first doctor she met.
She likes you, she trusts you, and now she's waiting for you.
About a million heart patients are waiting for me, too.
Right.
You can't let people down.
Thanks.
Um, was it because of the suit?
No. His kidneys failed, and that caused him to pass out.
But the surgery is going well,
and then we'll get him on dialysis.
This is just a complication of Jason's...condition.
It's all just complications.
And he should be able to continue with the study, so --
He won't.
Yeah, this -- this will be his excuse.
And he'll never forgive me for making him do it.
what? You didn't make him do this.
He told me once -- w-we were fighting,
and he told me that when we woke him
to ask him if he wanted to live,
he only said yes because he was looking at me --
That if it had been up to him...
If I wasn't there...
he would have said no.
So all this is because of me.
I mean, he -- he's miserable every day because of me.
And I-I'm -- I'm -- I'm -- I'm not a wife anymore.
I'm a nursemaid and a cook and an orderly,
and I never go home from that work.
I am that work. That's all I am anymore.
I wanted to have a child.
And I will never, ever have a child.
I'm sorry.
I'm being selfish. I'm horrible.
No, you're not.
No, no, no, no. Not at all.
Not at all. I-I totally understand.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
No. It's okay.
Get on out!
Okay, now, that is a healthy heart sip
that's both delicious and nutritious.
Thank you very much for that.
Next up, I'm going to debunk the top five
biggest health myths for you folks,
coming up right after this.
She better include my suggestion on too much calcium
increasing your risk of heart disease.
People pop those pills like candy.
I haven't seen you in two days.
Yeah, I took a couple extra night shifts.
I-I went by the trailer this morning.
Yeah, I just crashed in the on-call room.
Is something going on?
I need more, Cristina. You know?
I just can't keep...
I just need more, you know --
More from you, more from us.
Another, please?
You got it!
Okay, let's just get out of here.
Nope.
Let's go home. Just sleep this off,
and let's talk about it in the morning, can we --
We don't have a home, Cristina.
I have a trailer, and you have a room at Karev's house.
It's not...
Another, please.
Right up!
There you go.
Thank you.
There's too many.
The kids outnumber the adults.
Should've thought of that before we adopted again.
I mean, what if there's a mutiny? Derek and I will lose.
No, not until the third one can walk.
So, you broke up again?
Same thing, over and over.
You know what else is the same?
This.
You and I laying in this bed, talking about you and Owen.
Why do you keep doing this to yourself?
I need help.
Mer, you have to help me.
Don't let me go back to him --
for his good and mine.
Please help me.
Of course. Of course I'll help you.
What do you mean? It's been six months since my last procedure!
Your hand's still not healed!
You need more P.T. And more time in the skills lab.
You are not stepping into that O.R. --
Not today, maybe not ever!
All right, first of all, you need to lower your voice.
Okay! So, what, nobody can yell at you?
Why's that? Why is that?!
Because you're an Avery? Excuse --
That has nothing to do with any of this.
And you -- some pampered little rich boy
who was gifted a hospital...
so he thinks that it's okay to go ahead
and endanger patients,
'cause he's too damn proud to admit
that he can't operate anymore!
Dr. Hunt!
Do you know how many infants are
born without a pulmonary artery?
Cristina, I'm so sorry.
But there is a surgery to correct it.
It's called unifocalization,
which I was doing with a robot.
But now Shane is finishing it
because you paged me "911" Like a million times.
So whatever it is, it better be -- - It's Owen.
He wanted to work a shift. I didn't feel comfortable.
He only agreed to get in a bed if I paged you.
You came.
Give us a minute.
Oh, god, you stink.
You tried to start a shift?
Are you insane? You could've hurt someone.
Yeah. Yeah. I love you.
This has got to stop. I love you.
I love you. I love you, and...
I-I see you every day,
and I can't have you.
So --
So how am I supposed to keep doing this.
Keep working here, when...
every time I turn around...
...I see your face.
Owen...
Owen, Owen, Owen, Owen...
I love you. Please. Please.
Please marry me. Just marry me.
Owen
Why can't you just marry me?
Please, I'm begging you. I'm begging.
I am begging you.
I mean, we should never have called it quits.
We should never have called
it quits when we did. Please.
Just...
please marry me.
There's no sign of him yet,
but there's still plenty of time,
so there's no reason to panic.
I'm not panicked.
Okay.
Can you get my belt?
Sure.
You look beautiful.
Thanks.
He is late.
How could he be late to this?
I'll go look for him again.
Okay, we've got a full house, people.
Page -- page anyone who's available. - Yes, sir.
Watch your back. 10-year-old female thrown from a vehicle.
Multiple blunt injuries and hypotensive.
Hey, you -- assess her, then rush her up to radiology
get a C.T. with contrast.
Then page me as soon as -- - Um, excuse me.
Um, contrast, like the iodine dye?
I'm allergic to that. Do you think my daughter could be, too?
We'll run a test and check. Not a problem. Excuse me.
What've you got?
Do you want me to call him again?
No.
Do you have to take that?
'Cause you can go. It -- it's not like
you haven't been through this with me before.
It's a general page, for whoever's on call.
I'm not even on call. I'm not going anywhere.
What happened?
She was seizing -- severe allergic reaction.
I was passing by and saw this intern freaking out.
I've given her .3 epi.
Well, did anyone order contrast?
Was she tested for allergies?
I got paged. What's going on?
We need to get her to the O.R. immediately.
Let's start her on benadryl and steroids, stat!
Is this your patient?
Yes.
Why didn't you screen her for any contrast allergies?
I did.
It's not here.
I mean, there's no record of any tests.
I ordered it.
You did?
Yes!
You sure?
Yes.
You did?
Hey, I ordered the damn test!
Didn't I?
Cutting it a little close, don't you think?
Hi. Sorry I'm late. I know.
I got held up, and there was traffic and --
Anyway, sorry. I'm here now.
You look incredible.
Thank you.
Well... shall we do this?
Let's.
This is unacceptable.
Things like this keep happening,
and this time there was a kid involved.
And I'm not looking the other way any longer.
He's unreliable, a danger to his patients.
I mean --
did you smell his breath?
Yeah, well, let's just wait for the breathalyzer results.
No. We -- we need to convene an emergency board meeting.
Right now, Derek. Right now.
She's a pioneer, an inspiration, a mentor,
and, I'm proud to say, my friend for over 15 years.
Please welcome,
for an unprecedented fourth consecutive year,
tonight's Harper Avery Award recipient,
Dr. Cristina Yang.
I came as soon as I could.
You know he's just sitting out there waiting.
April, you run the trauma department.
You work with him more closely than anybody else.
Do you trust Owen Hunt to treat patients?
He is my mentor, and he trained me. I --
We value your opinion, April.
That's why you're here.
Just be honest.
Do you trust the man?
No, I don't.
I move to terminate him, effective immediately.
If there's one thing I've learned over the years,
it's that it only takes one person,
one patient, one moment,
to change your life forever --
to change your perspective, color your thinking,
to force you to re-evaluate everything you think you know...
to make you ask yourself the toughest questions...
Do you know who you are?
Do you understand what has happened to you?
Do you want to live this way?
I'm sorry, but I have to ask one more time.
Jason...
Would you like me to remove the vent?
Okay.
Hey, watch your hand.
Oh. Thanks.
Oh, no problem.
Hey, Cristina. Hey, you got a sec?
I could use a set of eyes on my patient.
Uh, yeah. Um, just give me one, uh --
