"Don't Dream It's Over"
We teach residents,
"When you hear hoofbeats, think horses, not zebras."
Wait, I know this is Derek Shepherd's phone.
Who -- who is this?
It means that the most obvious answer is usually right.
It keeps doctors from heading down the wrong path.
It helps us stick to the truth. It helps us save lives.
It's part of what makes me a good surgeon.
When I hear hoofbeats...
Horses.
Who is this?
I always think horses.
Hello?
Even when I shouldn't.
Do you have a minute?
Yeah.
I was, um -- I was just coming to see you.
How's your first full day going?
Exhilarating.
Hunt saved this little girl's mother over the phone.
It was nuts. It is so good to be back.
Come here.
A-all right.
That good, huh?
Yeah, that good.
You sure you don't want to take this home?
I mean, there's people right outside.
So what? I don't care. Who cares?
Okay.
Are you sure?
Do I seem unsure?
These are the moves of a sure person.
What more do you need?
Mm, I just want to make sure that you're...
What?
Just -- you know, you haven't wanted to since...since...
Wow, way to kill the mood.
No, April.
C-come on. I didn't...mean...
Pager.
No!
I know. Hey.
I'm sorry. Later.
We will continue this later.
We better.
Hi. You've reached Dr. Shepherd.
Please leave a message, and I will return your call.
Um, you really didn't have to walk me in.
I-I can --
I'm just trying to prolong our half-date.
I'm so sorry, but when I'm paged for trauma, I --
No, no, no, no, no, I sh-- I should have seen it coming.
Your profile did say "Crazy hours,"
And you're off to go save a life.
What's hotter than that?
Well, I'm glad I got to lay eyes on you in person.
Well, maybe we can do it again sometime.
Absolutely. First dates are overrated.
Maybe we should just jump to the end of this one.
Oh, I have to get to the pit.
Me too.
Great.
Okay.
I called Derek.
I'm laying here. I'm sleeping.
A woman answered his phone.
There are two empty beds. Pick one.
One empty bed. I'm up here. A woman answered his phone?
Whose phone?
Derek's phone.
What kind of woman?
Doesn't matter.
It matters.
It matters.
She was perky,
and she sounded happy and tall, with a lot of great hair.
Hold. You saw her? How did you see her?
I didn't.
I heard her voice, her perky, happy, tall voice.
I hate voices like that.
You can tell by the voice?
What did Derek say?
I didn't talk to him.
Now I keep going to voicemail.
My short, twisty, mad voice keeps going to voicemail.
He's not cheating on me, right?
He's not cheating on you.
He's not cheating on you.
Trauma.
So...
Big trauma coming in, huh?
Yeah. Uh, car accident, I think.
Yeah, I heard there were two victims, maybe more.
Yeah.
I like your, uh, dress.
Thanks.
I don't remember that one.
It's new.
What do we got?
30-year-old male.
He and his wife were hit by a car
that crashed into their house.
Abdominal contusions, right-upper-leg deformity,
binder applied for unstable pelvis.
Grey's in there now.
Robbins, trauma one.
Torres, I need you in trauma tw--
Oh, you're changing clothes.
You know, we have attendings' lounges for that.
Yeah. No time.All right, let's go.
Hang on. I'm gonna need a resident, too.
Edwards, you're with Torres. Uh, Wilson, go with Robbins.
Yeah! No, that's not fair!
Oh, I'm gonna pretend like I didn't hear that.
Sorry, but Dr. Torres' patient is also Dr. Grey's patient.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Dr. Grey?
Dr. Grey has not lost a patient in weeks.
Yeah. She's on a streak.
Now!
Should be excited to be working with me.
Paramedics couldn't get a line.
He's hypotensive and needs fluids asap.
We should get a central line.
Is this the husband? Tom Vinson. His wife is next door.
His B.P. is dropping.
Let's order some o-neg.
Edwards, help me with this binder.
Oh, I thought I was on Dr. Grey's service, so --
If we don't assess this pelvic fracture,
he could bleed out and die.
End streak.
Now, if he dies from the pelvic fracture,
isn't it technically on you, not Dr. Grey?
Edwards, zip it.
He's in v-fib. Starting CPR.
Grab the paddles. Charge to 200.
Charged. Clear.
Where's my patient?
Crap.
Find her -- now!
The band was practicing, mom.
W-we never would have heard the car.
What, I leave for 10 minutes,
and we suddenly let patients roam the halls unattended?
Ma'am, you cannot be walking around here.
Do you know who your doctor is?
Excuse me, you can't get out of bed.
You're not listening, mom. A car smashed into our house.
Do you know where my husband is?
Hi, Blair. I'm Dr. Robbins.
We need to check you and your baby out,
and this is not the right place to do it.
One sec. Mom, I just told you a car smashed into our house,
and that is what you are worried about?
The music is fine for the baby, mom.
My husband is in a punk-rock band,
and my mother doesn't approve...still.
It's been eight years.
Is -- is he okay?
He's back.
His B.P. is not fluid-responsive.
He's most likely bleeding inside. I need that ultr--
Oh, god, it hurts!
Tom, listen. We got you, okay?
Let's push 50 of fentanyl.
Tom, we have you. It's okay.
Oh, god, where's Blair? She's pregnant.
We know. She's in the hospital, Tom.
Is she hurt? Is our baby okay?
I need to see her. Let me see her.
Tom, you are seriously injured.
You need to settle down and let us do our job.
Blair!
His pressure's dropping again. Let's hang another unit.
We need to take him straight up. We ready?
Yep. Let's go!
All right, we need to assess her injuries
and monitor the baby.
I want a fetal monitor on her A.S.A.P.
Okay. Will do.
Hang on. Ha-- stop. That's my husband.
You okay?
Blair, baby, I can't see you.
I can't turn my head.
That's okay. It's okay. I'm right here, Tommy.
Are -- are you okay?
You know me. I'm...I'm tough.
How's the baby?
Great.
He's, um -- he's doing backflips right now.
I think he hears your voice.
I'm not feeling so great.
I love you.
I love you, too.
I can't move this damn thing.
65-year-old male complaining of chest pains.
Let me go. Let me go!
This the driver?
Vehicle's totaled -- amazing he even survived.
Get me out of this thing!
I just want to buy some shoes!
Is he drunk?
Seems to be.
They said he came to disoriented,
too combative for an exam.
We need to question him,
and we'll want your tox-screen results.
Okay, let us assess and treat him first.
If he has anything in his system,
we'll let you know. Thanks, officer.
Who are you? Give -- give me my car keys.
Sir, just calm down.
Just find my damn keys!
Sir, we need to examine you.
You've got to be still.
Oh, god, do you ever shut up for a sec-- oh!
Abdominal tenderness, feels like multiple fractures.
There could be some internal bleeding.
Would you back off?!
Sir, I need to listen to your heart.
And I said get the hell away from me!
Now will you give me some service, for god's sake?!
Dr. Pierce? Maggie!
Let go. Let me go!
Maggie. Can you hear me? Maggie?
Dr. Pierce!
Is someone gonna help me or not?!
I want four-point restraints
on him at all times!
Right away.
Let me tell you how this is gonna go.
You want to act like an animal,
we'll treat you like one.
You touch one of my doctors again,
You'll deal with me.
Take it easy. Nice and slow.
I'm fine. I'm fine.
Stop. Stop. Stop!
Any pain? Any dizziness?
Pierce, are you okay?
I'm fine.
Stop.
You're not fine till I say you're fine.
Get yourself a C.T. make sure it's nothing serious.
I'm gonna page Shepherd to take a look at you.
I-I can't -- I can't move in this!
Martin? Martin, I'm here.
I'm his wife.
Sally?
I-I just want some shoes.
Ma'am, has he been drinking?
Drinking? No.
My -- my husband has alzheimer's.
He has no idea what he's done.
All I needed was t-to take a shower.
I left Martin with the football game on -- he likes football.
But t-the keys.
I always hide the keys. I must have footten.
He would never, ever hurt a soul.
I'm so sorry he hit those people with the car.
Your, um, husband has multiple rib fractures,
and there's evidence that there's blood in his belly.
He's gonna need exploratory surgery
to see how extensive the damage is.
Okay. Uh, okay. Um, thank you.
Mrs. Davis, we need to ask you some questions.
Okay, Grey,
You and I will take care of the pelvic packing.
Torres, reduce the femur fracture.
Mm-hmm. Any word on the driver?
Alzheimer's. He thinks he's in a shoe store.
Oh, my god. Are you okay?
It's nothing. It's fine.
Did Derek call?
Nope.
He will.
We'll see.
It's okay.
You got scanned? Everything checked out okay?
Absolutely.
Okay.
Let's go scrub.
Okay.
Damn it, these pelvic veins are shattered.
More lap pads. See that, Grey?
I see it. I got it. Clamp. 3-0 silk.
You know what? I didn't even kiss her. She kissed me.
So why -- why am I compelled to apologize to Arizona?
Suction, Edwards. More. Lap pads.
I mean, I didn't do anything wrong.
Did I?
More lap pads. Pack it in there.
And why does she have to make it so weird?
And -- and what is my responsibility here?
I mean, time has passed.
I can date. She can date.
I want her to date. We can see other people.
Arizona was seeing other people
while the two of you were still married.
Sorry.
I just meant I think you can do whatever you want.
God knows she did.
The look on his wife's face -- she felt responsible.
She should feel responsible.
I can't believe that woman. It's like criminal negligence.
It's like going to the movies and leaving your infant at home.
If an infant could start a car and mow down innocent people.
Did you, uh, you want me to put a figure-eight stitch in here?
I mean, I'm not insensitive. I mean, I get that it's hard.
But, you know, if you can't be a responsible caregiver,
then find someone who can.
Do you need some water, Dr. Warren?
I think Dr. Warren's trying to subtly tell you to shut up.
I lost my wife to alzheimer's.
Richard, I'm so sorry. I had no idea.
Oh, it's okay.
You had no way of knowing about her or...
What?
It's nothing. I just... I wouldn't wish it on anyone.
There's some clear fluid oozing from the tear.
Uh, give me a 5cc syringe to sample it.
It's not a big deal. It's just a cut.
It's a very deep cut.
It's not any dizziness it's or blurred vision?
I keep telling everyone I feel fine,
except for the fact that I'm exhausted and ginormous.
You got anything for swollen feet?
I'd still like to order a head C.T.,
just to be safe.
So, your husband's in a punk-rock band?
Yeah. We met at a show.
Mm. I used to like punk rock once.
Okay.
What? I did.
I rocked the heavy eyeliner, and I had some t-shirts.
Sure you did, Robbins.
Hey, uh, Shepherd, how's Pierce?
Huh?
Her exam.
It's more of a post-punk scene now.
or proto-punk? I don't remember the differ...
Blair?
We've got a seizure. Blair!
Wilson, grab her arms.
Blair. Dr. Bailey, a little help.
Where do you want me?
Help us hold her steady.
Push 10 of lorazepam. Pupil's blown on the right.
She was conscious and talking just 10 seconds ago.
Walking and talking -- classic extradural hematoma.
How pregnant is she?
35 weeks. She's 35 weeks pregnant.
She isn't responding. Start her on phenobarbital.
She needs an airway.
All right, give me a 7-0 and a scope.
Well, it's swollen, is the problem.
You likely won't lose your tongue.
Lose my tongue?
Yeah, the bigger problem is, why were you stupid enough
to stick it in there in the first place?
'cause now your tongue is gonna continue to swell,
pulling the bottle deeper into your mouth
and cutting off your airway.
And then you're gonna die.
Die?!
Yeah, well, I'm sorry, but you kind of did this to yourself.
Dr. Kepner, can I see you for a second?
Absolutely.
One sec.
All right, listen, I really just think we need to --
W-what are you doing?
I thought you wised up.
No, we need to -- we need to talk.
Your first day back has already turned into your second,
and you're tearing into patients --
I am topless. Why are we talking about this?
April.
What is the matter?
What's the matter is that you keep holding me
like this delicate flower that's gonna break
every time you look at me.
That is what is the matter.
I'm gonna go pull a bottle out of this moron's mouth.
I will see you at home.
How we doing with that airway?
I can't get the tube in. Her teeth are gritted.
How long has it been?
We're almost at four minutes.
Persistent decels. The baby's in trouble.
The seizures are frying her brain.
Arizona, we need to put her under.
Okay, okay. Push 100 of sux and 20 of etomidate.
Oh. She stopped.
Oh, thank god.
Starting compressions.
Paddles!
Push one of epi.
Come on, Blair.
Okay, let's charge to 200. Everybody off.
Clear.
Still v-fib.
Again. Charge to 300.
Clear.
Arizona.
Push another epi -- 360. Clear.
Charging again.
Arizona.
Call it.
Time of death -- 23:16.
I don't -- she was just talking to us.
What happened that fast?
Massive intracranial bleed.
Can't come back from that.
Poor thing.
Major Tranq. Jo, you start bagging the patient.
Restarting CPR.
Wait, what?
Bag the patient.
Why?
Shut up and do what I said.
She's dead. Why are we doing CPR?
We have to keep her blood circulating.
For what?
Look, the mom's dead,
but as long as you pump that bag,
Her baby's still alive.
Oh. So --
It's time to deliver the baby.
Right here, right now?
Right here, right now.
Somebody page Karev 911. Tell him get down here. 10 blade.
Wait! betadine!
We forgot to put betadine on her belly
so that she's sterile.
Don't need it.
No, we do, because it's sta--
we don't need it!
She's dead, Jo. Mom's dead.
There's nothing left to protect her from.
Thank you, doctor.
How's the father?
Oh, if he makes it through the night,
he may have a chance.
Um...
Does...Maggie know that Ellis had Alzheimer's?
I don't know. We never talked about it.
Don't you think one of us should tell her?
I mean, she might want to find out, in case she --
I didn't want to know for a long time.
Well, what changed your mind?
I just realized not knowing isn't going to change anything.
It made me feel like I was in control, but I wasn't.
Whatever is gonna happen is gonna happen, no matter what.
Dr. Webber, uh, the driver, Martin Davis --
You need to come.
What's it?
I'm not sure.
Mrs. Davis.
What did you do?
He's back.
What do you mean?
He -- he knows who I am, who he is, where he is.
He's remembering everything I'm telling him.
Martin, the poem -- say it again.
Sally, hon, you got to let me catch me up, here.
No.
Fine.
O lift me from the grass.
I die, I faint, I fail.
Let thy love in kisses rain.
On my lips and eyelids pale.
He read it to me when he proposed.
I haven't heard it in years.
Now, will someone please tell me what's going on?
You cured him. You brought him back to me.
Thank you.
What the hell did we do?
I have no idea.
Say it again.
O lift me from the grass.
I die, I faint, I fail.
Let thy love in kisses rain
On my lips and eyelids pale.
My cheek is cold and white, alas!
Is your hand cramping?
Yeah.
Mine too.
Somebody paged me?
My heart beats loud and fast.
Oh, crap.
Oh, press it close to thine again.
Are you ready? - Yeah.
Where it will break at last.
Okay. Here we go.
The minute the baby's out, we can stop doing CPR.
He's out. He's out.
He's not crying. Arizona?
I know, not crying. Uh, Karev, stand by.
Bailey, the cord.
Okay.
Okay.
Karev, how is he? Alex?
Do you need some help over there?
Would everybody shut up?
Come on, little guy. Come on.
One minute apgar is eight.
He's okay.
Good breath sounds, heart's strong.
Strong lungs, too.
Wilson, you can go.
Nice save, Robbins.
Wait, wait, wait, go back.
So, I missed Lisa's wedding and her divorce?
He was a bum, just like you said.
Eh. This is weird.
It's -- it's like I stepped into a time machine
and went to the future.
And he's never had lucid days in the past? It's pretty common.
Never -- nothing like this.
Oh! Toby is in his second year at penn state.
Toby? Stupid Toby?
He pulled it together!
How about Heidi? How's Heidi?
17 and going strong. Heidi's our cat.
Five years. This is just...
This must have been awful for you.
I missed you.
I missed you so much.
I'm pretty confident
Dr. Webber has not found a cure for Alzheimer's.
I have a suspicion, but I would like to get an MRI
and confirm before we jump to any conclusions.
Okay.
Um, Sally told me that I was in a car accident.
Was anyone else injured, or --
Actually, there was --
Well, I know you have a lot of questions.
Let's talk after we have all the answers.
Uh, right now, dr. Shepherd needs to get that MRI.
Hey. How's the baby doing?
I'd love to have some good news before the dad wakes up.
Hi. How's he doing?
Vitals are stable. He's hanging in there.
Good.
I heard about the mom. You okay?
Yeah. It was...it was bad.
I'm so sorry.
Callie... um, about earlier.
Yeah, that was --
How long has that been going on, exactly?
It hasn't.
I mean, that was our first date, and it got cut short,
so we didn't even make it to dinner.
Yeah, no, so she just skipped right to dessert.
You know what? Let's not do this.
I'm -- I'm sorry. You know what?
I probably shouldn't be saying anything, but I -- ugh.
I feel like I have to.
You don't.
Arizona, I am seeing people. I will kiss them.
I didn't plan on that happening,
and I certainly didn't plan on you seeing that,
but I do not need to feel bad or apologize.
No, Callie, I...
I'm moving on, and you should, too,
And it's kind of not your business
who I see now, or kiss, okay?
You're right. Godspeed. Go...kiss everyone.
24-hour monitoring. He needs Q1 neurochecks.
Use pressors to keep his maps above 60.
If he's still stable,
Torres can go back into the pelvis tomorrow.
"If"?
There's no guarantee he'll make it through the night.
So, just to, um, clarify,
is this Dr. Torres' patient, officially,
or yours, or Dr. Grey's?
I-is this about her streak?
Dr. Grey has not lost a patient since November.
We are all pulling for her --
Well, stop it.
Dr. Grey.
If this guy dies, his little boy has no parents.
And if he's lucky enough to pull through this,
His life isn't gonna look anything like it did before this.
Is that really something we want to brag about or celebrate?
It has nothing to do with me.
How many since November?
89.
Wow, Grey, that has something to do with you.
Don't kid yourself.
Right there.
The swollen ventricles are the clue.
So he doesn't have Alzheimer's?
Nope.
It's called normal pressure hydrocephalus, or N.P.H..
Martin had a buildup of cerebrospinal fluid,
and it placed intense pressure on his brain, as you can see.
The accident caused a tear in the sheath around the spinal cord,
which released some of this fluid and reduced the pressure.
Isn't the fluid just gonna build up again?
If we do nothing, yes,
He'll go back to the way he was, probably in a matter of hours.
But we're not gonna do nothing.
The shunt is like a little hose
to keep fluid from building back up again.
Then I'll be okay?
We'll want to do some checkups, but...yes.
You'll have your husband back.
It's a miracle.
Uh, Dr. Webber,
Um, the police are asking if now is a good time.
Police? Why? What happened?
Hey. Where have you been?
I don't know. I just -- I needed some air.
You okay?
He's only been alive for two hours,
and he's already lost his mom,
his dad barely survived surgery --
He doesn't even have a name.
I'm calling him Dan.
How are we supposed do this?
The dead mothers, the motherless babies --
It's just too freaking hard and sad and messed up.
It sucks, but it's the job.
Really? Really?
Hey, let her go.
Come on, don't you remember what it was like to be a resident
and have all of this death around you,
Be new, terrifying?
Why do you think they care so much about this stupid streak?
Death is scary.
They just want to believe
that there's somebody out there who can defy it.
Geez!
Why are you... lurking in the dark?
You're lurking.
I can't sleep.
I'm wiped.
If you're gonna keep lurking,
please don't stare at me while I sleep.
Did you know when Arizona cheated on you,
before she told you?
What?
And with George -- did you know it?
Did you have a feeling?
Meredith, what -- what happened?
I killed a mother -- a pregnant mother.
Her baby survived. He's healthy.
A-and the father is... stable.
Martin, this wasn't your fault. You weren't in your right mind.
The police know that.
Martin, we have a short window here,
And it's closing.
We need to get you up to surgery
if I'm gonna place the shunt in time.
I don't...
I don't think I want it.
Mr. Davis, without the shunt, you --
I' forget all this. I know.
I'll forget that I'm a murderer.
No, Martin.
Martin, you -- think about what you're saying.
I know you're upset, but just take a moment, Martin.
I don't need a moment, doc!
Marty, don't. Please don't do this.
I -- I -- I can't lose you again.
Please.
Sally. Honey.
I don't remember the last five years.
I lost them.
I come back, I wake up here, to this?
It's not my life. It's not our life.
It'll never be our life again.
I can't live with this.
I can't.
You just let me go. You put me in a home.
Don't look back. You let me rot.
You let me go.
It's not fair. Can't she just override him?
Martin was very clear. That's not what he wants.
Y-- maybe she can wait
until the fluids build up in his brain again,
And -- and then she can just make a choice for him.
It's his decision, Warren,
not his wife's, not ours.
He's our patient.
He's lucid...
And he's made his wishes very clear.
Now, we may not agree with them, but it's our job to honor them.
I thought you went home.
No, I was waiting for you.
I can make it home on my own.
I've done it lots of times.
Stop it, please.
Well, stop treating me like some fragile, little --
Why wouldn't you be fragile?
And why wouldn't I worry about that?
It's been almost two months.
Every day, I wake up and remember
And have to fight just to pull my crap together.
So if it's that hard for me,
I got to figure it's way harder for you.
So you know what? I will watch you.
I will worry about you. I'm not gonna apologize for that.
It's kind of what I'm here for.
I just -- I just want to be myself again.
I just -- I just want to feel like me.
I know.
I was just saying, you don't seem like you.
I am! I am! This is me!
Trying to give you space -- - I don't need space!
I am telling you, I don't --
Of course I want to have sex with my wi --
I am your wife!
I'm right here!
I am your wife.
He probably just lost his phone and some random lady found it.
Stretch.
Or it was stolen, some chick stole it and answered it.
Bitch.
How's the driver?
So sad.
He had Alzheimer's, but then he didn't have Alzheimer's,
but then he didn't want to have killed someone,
so now he's gonna go ahead and keep the Alzheimer's
That isn't really Alzheimer's.
Did Webber talk to you?
About what?
Nothing.
Hey, maybe a kid stole it, and his mom picked it up.
Stole what?
Derek's phone.
We're talking Meredith off a ledge.
I'm good at this.
What?
Options.
He was in surgery, and a nurse picked it up.
They pick up our phones all the time.
He was in the lab,
and a research assistant picked it up.
He was in the bathroom, and a janitor picked it up.
He was in an accident, and a paramedic picked it up.
Hey, listen, it's no the best option, but viable.
I'm just saying, don't go looking for zebras here.
I think Derek is --
He's done this before.
What?
Moved to a new city, got a new job,
ignored his wife's calls, met a girl,
fell in love, started over.
Wait, what are you talking about, "Met a girl"?
Me. He met me.
He left Addison when the marriage got hard,
moved to Seattle, met me in a bar.
What if he's doing the same thing now?
Say something.
Look, I've watched you two suck face for years.
You've disgusted me for a long, long time.
He's into you.
And if a guy is still into you,
it still means he wants to do you.
And if he still wants to do you, you're solid.
I don't know you as well as everyone else here,
but I really need to tell you to stop talking now.
I didn't want to say anything in the first place.
Mer, I lived down the hall from you guys.
I've heard the sex noises.
I've seen the drama and the tears.
And there is no way that Derek's --
Look, you and Derek are living proof that love exists,
that it works, that there is hope.
You guys are a freaking romance novel.
And I, for one, am rooting for you two.
Team MerDer!
I'm not saying that.
Well, somewhere in Georgetown,
there's a woman -- a very tall, happy, perky woman
with a lot of great hair.
What if she met Derek in a bar?
What if he fell for her?
I'm pretty sure her friends are rooting for her, too.
Listen, I'm not a zebra in this scenario.
I wish I were, but I'm not. I'm just a horse.
Streak is over.
He bradyed down to 20 and went into third-degree block.
I gave him atropine.
And he's in fib. How long, Edwards?
Three minutes.
Starting compressions.
Grab the paddles.
Me?
Yes, Edwards, you.
Charge to 200.
Charged.
Clear.
We're losing him.
No, we're not. Charge to 270.
Charged.
Clear.
Oh, my god.
We -- we did it.
You did it.
Nice work, Edwards.
I thought --
The streak was over?
Well, no, I just --
Don't leave him. Check him every 20 minutes.
Do serial crits.
Make sure there's no blood in the wound vac.
Keep him alive.
Uh, one -- one more thing...
Oh, come on.
...about Heather.
You found out her name?
What is wrong with you?
I know her name because I-I u-- I used to go out with her.
Well, I'm sorry, but that's gonna happen sometimes,
and I can't be expected to --
Heather is steak knives.
What?
Steak knives.
The steak knives?
Yes.
The one who wanted you to get matching tattoos?
On our four-week anniversary, yes.
And then when you didn't want to, she --
Oh, my god.
She seemed so nice.
I know.
You never would have seen it coming.
And I didn't know if it was my place to tell you.
But I wasn't jealous. I was just...worried.
Thank you.
Holy crap, thank you.
Sure.
You ready?
Um, wait. Uh, I'll catch up.
Wilson.
Dr. Bailey, I am so sorry for earlier.
It will never happen again.
I've pulled myself together and --
Don't apologize for caring about your patient.
A lot of doctors aren't willing to go all-in.
It hurts too much.
But that's what's gonna make you such an excellent doctor.
It is?
I have a Whipple in the morning, Wilson.
Scrub in.
You ready?
You okay?
Um, it's a crappy day.
Well, the baby lived. The dad lived.
We beat the universe two to one. It's a good day.
So...it's later now.
Oh, for god's sake.
You've got to be kidding me.
Well...
Yeah.
Yeah.
O lift me from the grass.
I die, I faint, I fail.
Let they love in kisses rain on...
On my...
On my lips.
On my lips...
Yes.
...and eyelids pale.
This can't be easy for you.
No.
It's not.
I'm so sorry about your wife.
It wasn't just my wife.
Ellis had Alzheimer's.
It started early. It ended her career.
It was devastating to Meredith...
and to me.
Oh, my god.
I...
thought you would want to know.
Obviously, it means that you're genetically inclined.
Oh, my god.
I-I-I-I'm so sorry.
No, no, no. I -- - I didn't mean for the news to --
No.
I never actually got that C.T. earlier.
I'm just a little dizzy.
I think I might have a concussion.
Margaret Pierce. You lied to me?
I did. I'm sorry.
Richard, I had a full genetic history done
when I was 12.
A lot of adopted kids do.
I have a genetic predisposition for Alzheimer's.
Why do you think I do a crossword puzzle every five minutes?
So you -- - I have it, yeah. I knew I had it.
I just never knew where it came from.
I was dreading having to say anything.
I was worried it came from you.
Oh, my god. I'm so glad it doesn't.
Things are not always what they appear to be.
They're often an indicator of something bigger going on,
deep underneath --
symptoms, red flags,
warning signs,
things we should pay attention to,
things we shouldn't ever ignore...
I took the first flight. Left my keys.
...things that are bad,
things that could really hurt us...
You called me, and a woman answered my phone.
I called you, and a woman answered your phone.
...things that
it might just be too late to fix.
