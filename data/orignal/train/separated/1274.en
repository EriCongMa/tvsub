Back off, Merton. Back off.
Shh! Quiet!
Do you want the neighbors to complain again?
It doesn't get any better than this, does it, Merton?
Yes! Done!
Every follow-up report. What's my prize?
Two days off to hang with your boyfriend.
Mm! First days I've taken in a year.
BPD owes me 116.
That's nothing. They owe me 243.
Why are you two competing
over who takes the fewest vacation days?
Because we're studs.
So what do you and Casey have planned?
Well, he's only on leave for 72 hours, so nothing.
Jane.
He sent seven letters in the last five days.
He's bored.
He'll get a new prison pen pal eventually.
I'm curious.
For all I know,
Paddy could be confessing to another crime.
Oh, I'm sure that's it.
They're releasing him.
They're what?
They can't. He's awaiting trial
for the murder of Cavanaugh's wife and baby son.
No, I-I don't mean Paddy.
His father -- Ppatrick Sr.
Paddy's father's still alive?
Yeah, he's the first Boston mob boss
to ever to go down for R.I.C.O.
He's been locked up for -- what? -- 30 years.
31.
What? Let me see this.
"Of all the people guilt-tripping --"
He wants you to take in his father.
Didn't Patrick sr. threaten to kill Hope
when he found out Paddy got her pregnant?
Yes. He did.
And who was Hope pregnant with?
I can't really remem-- oh, yeah! You, maura!
The parole is conditional.
They'll revoke it
if he doesn't have a place to live by tomorrow.
Paddy says he won't last much longer in prison.
Well, is it bad form to say, "Yay"?
He's on a waiting list for public housing.
It might just be a few days.
I could at least put him up in a hotel.
No, you can't.
He has to have a permanent address.
Dr. Isles.
Rizzoli.
Yes.
Okay.
All right.
All right, we got it.
We got a floater in a hot tub.
First responders aren't sure
if it was an accidental drowning.
Please, please don't let this
mess up my plans with Casey, please!
You want me and Korsak to take it?
What the hell is that, Frost?
I put "Shot Alert" on my computer to track city shootings myself.
Okay, here we go. Moss Hill Gym and racquet club.
Dispatch.
Looks like we got a victim there. You take that.
Jane and I will take the floater.
Then who's helping me?
Martinez got you on anything?
No. What do you need.
There's your help.
Well, at least she was having a good time.
Wine, weed, and cheese doodles.
Oh, there was a boom box in there with her.
She was electrocuted.
I can't be certain of cause of death
until I dissect her lungs.
She seems to have a significant amount of adipose tissue.
And this sheen appears to be glycerol.
Body fat and lotion.
That would slow down conductivity.
Yeah, boom box was pushed into the hot tub.
We got ourselves a murder.
Pink froth around her lips and nose.
You have a tell when your head's not in the game.
I don't know what you mean.
"Pink froth"?
Not "cytoplastics hematoma liquidity
at a cellular level"?
No.
You still ruminating over your messed-up family?
Paddy Doyle isn't my family.
But he is part of my genetic makeup,
as is my grandfather, and I want to meet him.
Oh, so now you're Heidi,
and you're gonna climb the Alps with gramps and feed the goats?
Pink froth is a result of hemolysis
due to rupture of red blood cells
and the release of cytoplasm into surrounding fluid.
So she inhaled water.
You see anything that suggests she was held under?
I see some bruising on her shoulders, yes.
That's the friend who found the body.
The victims Rhonda Clark.
She's a professor in the sociology department at B.C.U.
The ladies had a weekly date in the hot tub.
Yeah, with Mr. Chardonnay and Mrs. Cannabis.
Yeah, I sent officers to B.C.U. to get the husband.
He's a sociology professor, too.
Okay.
Hey, Merton! Here, boy!
Robert Merton was a famous sociologist.
He developed the concept of unintended consequences.
Can you make him stop?
Watch this. Hey.
Here, Merton. Here, boy.
Good dog!
Quiet!
Nice try, dog whisperer.
Can you put him back in the house?
Wait, Korsak, did we get any complaints tonight
from the neighbors about a dog barking?
I can ask. Why?
Well, he's a barker.
If he's not barking his head off
when his master's getting murdered
then that means he knows the killer.
Good thinking.
Hey, Frost, what do you got?
Sweet ride.
You never see this color. It's called "Beluga Black."
I meant the victim.
Oh, uh, sorry. Sorry.
Mark Cabot, 37.
He was the very wealthy head of annisquam investments.
The Cabots are an old family -- Boston brahmins.
He's a member of this club.
Parks his expensive car by itself
in the "Platinum circle."
Witnesses?
None, and the security cameras
were in the process of being upgraded.
That's convenient. Robbery?
As his wallet and very nice watch are still here,
so I don't think so.
We'll process the scene and wait for Dr.Isles.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
Okay, Frankie, you got to do the notifications.
Me?
He's married.
His wife and his sister worked with him.
I called the company. They're still at work.
It's an awful part of the job,
but you got to get used to it, okay?
You can do it.
Okay.
Merton is quite the barker.
We got a long list of complaints,
but none tonight.
And the dog wasn't barking on the 911 call.
That's interesting.
Nothing seems disturbed upstairs.
This must be the husband.
I wonder where he was tonight.
I told her so many times to be careful in the hot tub.
This is tragic.
Just as she was about to get everything she wanted.
What was that?
Tenure.
We were that -- that lucky academic couple.
What do you mean, because you worked at the same university?
That never happens, especially not with
a liberal-arts subject like sociology.
It's so competitive.
Did you have tenure?
Why?
It must have been difficult
being married to someone who was about to have tenure before you.
She deserved it.
Can you tell us where you were this evening?
Why?
My wife drowned, didn't she?
She was murdered.
Where were you?
Just what the hell are you asking me?
Okay, I loved my wife, all right?
We -- we were partners. We did everything together.
Where were you?
With my students.
Okay, my office hours are from 5:00 to 9:00 P.M.
You can ask them.
You know what? Better yet, why don't you ask big brother?
NSA isn't the only agency that's watching us.
I got a parking fob, I got a building pass.
This is my ATM card.
You check my digital footprint if you don't believe me.
That's a good idea. I think I'll do that now.
The older one's the sister.
That's the wife.
God, how do I do this?
You just got to do it.
Maybe I'll stay in Drug Unit.
If I can look at dead bodies, you can do this.
Can I help you?
I'm Detective Frank Rizzoli, Boston Homicide.
I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but...
Boston Homicide?
God, it's not...
Please, no. - Jenny, it isn't -- it isn't Mark.
I'm afraid it is.
What?
We found his body.
What?
I'm so very, very sorry.
Oh, my god.
Got it, Jane. Thanks.
That was my partner.
Big brother just gave you the thumbs-up.
She'll meet you downstairs with your card and keys.
I told you.
Apologies for the tough questions.
Look, all that matters now is that you find out
who did this to Rhonda.
We think your dog might have known the killer.
How well would Merton have to know someone
before he'd stop barking?
Really well.
How many people did he know that well?
A lot of people.
Rhonda had office hours at home,
so there were students there all the time, and faculty,
and she had a lot of friends.
I'll call you if we have anything.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Hey, uh, the victim's wife and sister asked me
if they could have a sergeant with them
in the interview room.
Did frankie screw up the notification?
No, but they sensed how green he is.
We sure they're not suspects?
Positive. I checked their parking cards.
They never left the building's garage.
In their cars, anyway.
I checked the office's online server, too.
They were both logged in when he was gunned down.
Okay.
Come on. Let's talk to them.
We need to ask both of you if Mark had any enemies.
You'll find this out soon enough.
My brother was an acquired taste.
He was a really wonderful human being...
if he liked you.
But he wouldn't win any popularity contests.
He headed up a leading arbitrage company.
You don't make friends buying companies to tear them apart.
Competitors called him "Darth Raider."
I mean, to his face.
He was really funny about it.
He'd just...smile.
I think I'm hearing you say he had a long list of enemies.
It shouldn't matter what people thought of Mark.
Business acumen and arrogance shouldn't get you killed!
It shouldn't, but it might have.
We need a list of anyone you think might be responsible.
Okay. We can do that.
We'll also need all former and current clients --
Anyone that Mark did business with.
Yeah, Leslie handles all that.
Yeah, it's a family-owned company.
I'll give you everything.
Initial tox screen confirmed she had
a 0.01 blood alcohol level,
and a high level of cannabis in her system.
Oh, well, add electricity to that,
and she wouldn't be hard to hold underwater.
Oh, put him over here on the table.
Is that the shooting victim?
Yes.
He was shot at close range.
The bullet's still lodged in the skull.
How did Frankie do at the scene?
Good. Very composed. But he had a good teacher.
Oh, I need Frost's magic fingers.
Wait. Okay, here we go.
Rhonda and Rick Clark were both experts in
anomie, whatever that is.
The study of social instability --
Environment has a significant effect on genetic expression.
One more reason to be thankful
that Paddy Doyle didn't raise you.
So, she was about to get tenure, and he wasn't.
Well, that will put a strain on a marriage of academics.
Sayre's law -- the politics of a university are so intense
because the stakes are so low.
Seems so surprising that even smart people can't get it together.
Why is that surprising?
I just can't understand
why you would even lift a finger to help him.
Well, I...I could say
it's the compassionate physician in me.
But the truth is,
I'll never not be Paddy Doyle's daughter.
I just want to know where he came from.
Why?
Why does anybody trace their heritage?
You didn't get the bullet out yet?
Yeah, Maura. Come on.
The body's been here at least 30 seconds.
Oh. Sorry.
So what should I do while I wait for ballistics?
Korsak said the wife and sister
gave you a list of enemies.
And a long one.
The gym managers high-fived when we told them
who the victim was.
Sounds like the whole place wanted this guy dead.
Get this -- when he lost a squash match,
he peed in his opponent's locker.
Wait. He urinated in it?
That is what "peed" means, yes.
His tires were slashed multiple times.
Car was keyed.
Any idea who did it?
No idea.
That's why they were setting up the new security cameras.
Mark Cabot demanded it.
Okay, so start with the gym members.
Find out who's a registered gun owner.
Great. Thanks, Jane.
Yep.
Are you looking through my personal files?
Well, if you don't want anyone looking,
don't label them "Personal."
"Personal" -- related to a person's private affairs.
You got Patrick Sr.'s medical records?
"Congestive heart failure, arthritis, emphysema..."
This man needs assisted living.
Maura, you can't take this on.
It's temporary, Jane.
I think you're nuts.
Rizzoli.
I got a delivery now?
You got a delivery?
What are you doing here?
You're a day early.
Okay. I can come back.
No! Get over here.
Mm. No, I'm -- I'm at work.
I don't care.
There you are.
Why didn't you wake me?
I didn't want you in my way.
Wow. You cook, too?
Where did you get the eggs and all the vegetables?
Farmers' market.
Really?
You're like a 17th-century wife.
Is that good or bad?
Well, it's fantastic. I've always wanted a wife.
What do you want to do today?
Watch me churn butter or help me beat the dust from the rugs?
Oh, Casey, I have to go to work.
Oh, my bad. I showed up early.
Well, I know. I just -- I --
What happened in my fridge?
It met a bucket of soapy water and a sponge.
Did -- did you throw the orange juice out?
It was empty. I tossed it.
What d-- No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
You can't throw the ketchup out.
Jane, you make enough money to eat food that didn't expire in 2007.
You were growing things in there.
And you did the laundry.
Never put off till tomorrow what you can do today.
Well, I just -- I feel guilty.
Well, I was hoping you'd feel loved.
Yeah.
I do feel loved.
You do?
Do you?
Yes, I really feel loved.
Morning!
Good morning, ma!
Okay, well, don't let me interrupt...
Charles.
Someday, I'm gonna make you call me Casey.
Look, I know you two are grown-up,
but I still don't approve.
Oh, really?
This coming from the woman who's canoodling with my boss.
Jane, for heaven's sake, what's wrong with you?
What are you doing here?
Your brothers are slobs, and I needed a place to stay.
Is that...
...sauted zucchini?
Fresh garlic and sea salt -- you want some?
Yes. - Wait. Do not encourage --
Wait.
What?
Did Maura kick you out
so she could move in grandpa Patrick?
She said she needed the guest house
for somebody who couldn't climb stairs.
Who's Patrick? It's good.
Patrick Doyle, Sr.
Paddy's father?
She gave my guest house to a criminal?
It's not exactly your guest house, ma.
Well, I certainly don't want to stay with him,
nor do I want to stay where I am not wanted.
Really? That's good news.
Unless it's with family.
Excuse me.
Are you sure, ma?
Because, you know, me and my lover
are going to be doing lots of things
that you don't approve of.
Go ahead.
Wait. But, ma, look.
You could get some tips for you and Cavanaugh.
Oh, for crying out loud, Jane!
That's disgusting.
No, come on. I was kidding.
Where are you going? Ma, come on.
I'm gonna go to Maura's spare bedroom.
What about Patrick Doyle?
Well, if he can stand it, so can I.
If you make her an honest woman,
I'll call you anything you want, Charles.
Goodbye, Jane.
Bye, ma.
Did you get Frankie's bullet out?
Yes. And your mother hates me.
No. She loves your guest house.
And you, too.
She hardly said one word to me.
Well, enjoy the silence for a while.
She'll be fine, unless Patrick puts a hit out on her.
Too soon?
You have a tell, too.
And what is my tell?
Your jokes get a little edge when something's bothering you.
It's Casey?
I can't take my day off to be with him
because I have yet another homicide to solve.
That is a lie.
I could have totally taken a day off today, and I didn't.
You want to know why?
Yes, I do know why.
Because you love solving homicides.
You love your work.
Yeah, and I can't tell him that.
I feel guilty.
Besides, the guy's been in town 10 hours --
He's already washed my underwear.
My thongs, Maura.
That's awkward.
Yeah, tell me about it.
And he cleaned out my refrigerator.
Now, that, I approve of.
There are alternaria spores
and maybe even rhizopus on your pastrami.
Jane, this isn't about Casey. It's about you.
Yeah, it is.
I can't be me and be his, too.
So, tell him.
How do people make this work?
I mean, I love him. I want him to stay.
And I want him to go.
Those are mutually exclusive desires.
Yes, this much I know, Maura.
Hmm, look what I'm seeing in the mucosa of the primary bronchi.
Oh, thank god for mucosa.
A hair.
It's a canis lupus hair.
A dog. She had a dog.
Yeah, but it's not Merton's. It's not from a labradoodle.
Maybe our killer had a dog, too.
Hi, how many students had office hours
with Rhonda at her home?
Just about to head over to B.C.U.
to get a list of everybody -- we can ask.
Okay. We need to find out how many of them own dogs.
Hey, I've been going through
all of Mark Cabot's business dealings --
Customers, vendors, clients.
So far, no one stands out.
What's the matter?
Oh, I was hoping you had something.
No hits on the bullet Maura recovered
from Mark Cabot's body.
Well, don't get discouraged.
I've solved a lot of cases without ballistics.
What else you got?
Nothing.
Except they don't make bigger douche bags than Mark Cabot.
What about the other gym members with the gun licenses?
49 gym members have guns.
That's a hell of a lot of guns.
We should check 'em all.
The dean of the sociology department
has that list prepared.
Let's go.
Okay.
They're releasing him in two hours.
I can't face him alone.
I can go to B.C.U. alone.
Maura can't go to souza-baranowski prison alone.
Go, Jane.
Oh... the things I do for you.
Sign there, there, and there.
Thank you.
You have to sign for his wheelchair?
Well, it's government issued. He'll have to give it back.
Oh, yeah, 'cause you're really tempted to steal a used wheelchair.
There are prisoners here in their 90s, Jane.
Well, this guy's a spring chicken.
That's my grandfather.
Hello, Mr. Doyle. I'm...
I know who you are.
You look like that, uh...
that woman, that, uh... that hope.
She's my biological mother. I'm Dr. Maura Isles.
"Biological."
Put a lot of stock in that, do you?
Biology?
You gonna tell me
that you're, uh, Paddy's daughter
'cause my son knocked up some college girl?
You should have never seen the light of day.
Put him back, Maura.
Your girlfriend's right.
Listen, sweetheart.
Leave me here. I like it here.
I don't want anything to do with you.
Great. Sit here and rot.
Maura, let's go.
Oh, no, you don't.
Oh, yes, we do.
You signed the paperwork.
Patrick Doyle's not our problem anymore.
He's all yours.
I'm warning you.
Don't push me where don't I want to go.
You don't got a choice.
This is just temporary.
As I told you,
you'll be in assisted living in just a few days, Mr. Doyle.
And as I told you, take me back to my cell,
and don't you call me "Mr. Doyle."
What should she call you? Number 2492?
I said, take me back.
Hey, you heard the man. You're our problem now.
Until I can give you back to the state.
I can see where Paddy got all of his lovely traits.
Come on. We got to get back to work.
Jane.
He is a hideous human being,
but I can't just leave him here alone.
Take me to southie.
That's great idea. We could dump him at 8th and I.
I got plenty of friends in southie.
Oh, yeah? Like who, huh?
Mikey Kelly? Big Murph? Huh?
Duba Shaughnessy? They're all dead, Patrick!
Don't you call me Patrick, lady.
No! No!
I know. I know. I'm coming back soon.
You said you'd be here an hour ago.
I've got all of Rhonda's files here.
Let's close this sucker
and get you off to canoodle.
Who's barking?
Elsie.
Hey, sergeant.
Is -- is Casey there? - Yeah.
Jane.
Hey, babe. How come you're not at work?
It's a long story. Listen.
Um, Elsie was trained to
assist soldiers in wheelchairs, right?
Yeah, why?
I need a favor.
Okay, that's enough, now. Huh?
You're beginning to bug me a bit, huh?
Good girl. Yeah, you're a big girl.
Don't read anything into that.
Even psychopaths like dogs.
I know.
But thank you for bringing her.
At least he's stopped complaining.
I'll get her comfortable with him,
and then we'll try some stuff.
He's like the soldiers with disabilities
I see all the time.
Except he's a crook.
Might be hard for you to believe, but he's scared.
Of me, I hope.
Scared of change.
See it in the military -- guys used to that life.
Some start to think they can't live outside the system.
Anyway, you two go back to work.
What? No. You can't stay here.
I want you to go back to work so you get home sooner.
Go. I got it.
Thank you.
Don't get too friendly. He's not moving in with us.
"us," huh? I like the sound of that.
How do we get Patrick out of Maura's house?
I know a guy in the housing authority.
Really? You could pull a fix?
Not a "Fix." A favor.
Just get him off the wait list and out of your hair.
Okay, yeah. Don't tell Maura, but do it.
What did you get at B.C.U.?
I spoke to the dean.
Professor Rhonda Clark had a stellar reputation.
I brought her files and her personal belongings
from her office.
Wow! Is that Rhonda?
Yeah. Hard to believe, huh?
What do we blame -- the weed or the crunchy snacks?
Any of her students stand out?
Yeah, this one. Peter Kaufman.
He was actually Rick's student,
but it was up to Rhonda to decide
whether to let Peter into their PhD program.
And?
And according to the dean,
Rhonda washed him out.
Peter didn't take it well.
She recorded his final oral presentation.
If this has anything to do with gruel for Patrick
or where to hide the good silver,
I'm trying to catch up.
It's about dog hair.
Oh! Did you find the breed?
Yes. It's a German shepherd.
High levels of dander,
which explains the mucosal edema I found
in the lung tissue samples.
She was allergic?
But she had a dog.
Merton was labradoodle. No dander.
But if she had a histamine reaction,
doesn't that mean that she inhaled the hair?
Yes.
And since she was still breathing,
the hair wasn't in the water.
It means the hair could have been on the killer.
Maybe the killer had a German shepherd.
The root ball's still intact. I could test the dog hair.
Find out if the dog was on any medication.
That might help us identify it.
I'll see what I can do.
Let's look at this student, Peter.
He had motive. Maybe he had a German shepherd.
Peter's giving his oral presentation.
Guess it's like an audition to get into the PhD program.
Sorry, Peter. I have to stop you.
I've listened to your presentation with grave concerns.
Where is this material from?
That's professor Rhonda.
My own research, professor.
I have reason to suspect this is plagiarized.
No, it isn't.
I suspect your logistic regression analysis
is also based on someone else's research.
Plagiarism is cause for immediate expulsion.
You can't just sit there and accuse me of plagiarism,
you fat bitch.
Hey, Peter! That is enough!
No. No!
You will not be continuing in this program.
You need to leave right -- - You can't do this to me!
You understand?!
Hey, hey, hey! Back off, pal!
That is one angry graduate student.
Let's pick him up.
Smell that?
Weed.
Maybe Peter was Rhonda's dealer.
How much do you want?
All of it.
Killed her? What are you talking about?
I feel bad that she's dead.
She accused you of plagiarism.
Okay, that pissed me off,
and, yeah, maybe I shouldn't have smoked that blend
before I gave my presentation.
It makes me kind of paranoid.
Kind of?
Listen. She was good people.
Way smarter than her husband.
I always wished that she was my adviser, not him.
When we got stoned together --
You smoked with her?
In the hot tub and at the house.
We'd talk about the mismatch of social mores
in capitalist culture, the lack of legitimate aspiration,
the breakdown in social bonds --
That's all very interesting, Peter.
Let's talk about why you attacked your hot-tub buddy
when she kicked you out of the program.
You spend four years in college, two years in graduate school,
and then, boom, someone says the "P" word,
and you're out.
That was original work. It's all on this drive.
Run it on one of the plagiarism search engines.
Where were you last night?
In my apartment with friends.
Getting high?
What else do I have to do now?
We're gonna need a list of names to confirm that.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Don't ever apologize for being dedicated to your work.
So...did your grad student have an alibi?
Oh, of course, so that's another dead end.
What about the German shepherd?
There are 500 of those dogs in Boston, so --
Wait, no! Why are we talking about my work? No.
Did grandpa Patrick make you want to jump on a cargo plane
back to Afghanistan?
Don't hit me, but I, uh --
I kind of enjoyed being with him.
Ow! I said don't hit me.
Well, Korsak found him a spot in public housing,
so I can probably can get him moved in a day or two.
He's spent almost half his life in prison.
And you've spent almost half your life in the service.
Yeah.
You can get used to anything, even come to depend on it.
Hey, you should congratulate me.
I'm a colonel.
Oh, my god! Casey! That's --
Congratulations! Oh, my --
Oh, we need some champagne.
Could be I'll never --
Never do anything as well as I do that.
What are you saying?
I'm about to hit 20 years.
I have a decision to make, Jane.
Well, what kind of decision?
Stay or go.
I'm right where I thought I wanted to be.
Where's that?
In line to become a general.
I feel like an anthropologist.
He's actually kind of fascinating.
He's very regimented.
He has to eat exactly at 7:00 A.M.
Are you making powdered eggs?
Yes.
He likes them overcooked.
Do you cut the crusts off his toast, too?
No.
Just burn the edges and cut them into squares.
Oh, so no triangles?
Your tell is showing. What's wrong?
Casey.
Here I was thinking that he wanted to settle down.
He told me that he had to either accept or decline
his orders next month.
What does that mean?
I think it means
that he loves the army more than me.
Oh, Jane.
I don't want to talk about this,
or I'll never make it through the day.
When do we get the results back on the root ball?
Oh, uh, Susie called this morning.
The german shepherd was on a drug for arthritis --
Carprofen.
Oh, my god. It's 6:58.
Oh, my god.
I told you -- if he doesn't eat exactly at 7:00,
then he's not gonna eat at all.
There he is.
Will you give him his breakfast?
What? Why me?
I'm wearing my pajamas, Jane.
I'm not hungry.
But it's powdered eggs and burnt toast
and freezer hash browns.
You eat it, then.
I don't like prison food.
I didn't either. But I got used to it.
So eat your breakfast.
No reason anymore.
There was a reason in prison?
You think I'm some sort of pathetic mobster.
But inside, I'm still somebody in that prison.
Well, life has given you another chance to be somebody
other than some forgotten mobster.
Now eat your damn breakfast and thank Maura for her trouble!
Patrick Jr. was my only son.
I was all he needed...
until that -- that woman, that -- that Hope, came along
and -- and changed things, turned him away from me.
Yeah, well,that isn't Maura's fault.
It's her fault I'm gonna die out here.
Paddy asked her to take you.
He what?
But...
Yeah. He's punishing me.
I wanted to stay where I was.
I...
I-I told him, I...
He put me outside...
because...
he wants to see me die...
as a nobody.
Maybe he put you out here so you could see
the one good thing he's done --
Maura.
Bruno. He looks nice.
Mm, yes, he does.
Did you just make an online-dating love connection?
Funny.
I'm pulling up all the registered german shepherds.
I always wanted one -- the good ones are direct and honest,
but not hostile, like you.
Thank you.
I'm sorry I made a joke. Is that my tell?
Your what?
What tell?
You have no idea what I'm talking about, do you?
Is this a trick question?
I'm so thankful that some of the people I work with are guys.
No! Let's talk dogs, Korsak.
For a guy running a billion-dollar company,
this Mark Cabot sure had a lot of time to go to the gym.
You still thinking he was killed by another member?
Maybe.
He was there every day and on every tournament team.
I asked myself the same question,
so I looked through the company's minutes.
Mark was never there. Guy was a slacker.
Well, maybe somebody on the board wanted him out.
His wife and sister were on the board, right?
Yeah, but they both have solid alibis.
And Mark gave everyone motive.
He controlled everything, made all the big decisions,
took all the credit.
I found six german shepherds
that live within 10 blocks of Rhonda's house.
Jane, there's a dog park near Rhonda's house.
Dogs need special tags to use it.
I'm pulling up all the german shepherds.
Wait a minute. Your vet has to sign off on the forms.
I bet we can find out if any of those dogs
were on that drug that we found in the dog hair.
Look at that name --
"Jaco" The german shepherd.
Owner is Leslie Cabot.
What the hell? Leslie Cabot is our victim's sister.
It's here in the dog's records.
Leslie Cabot's german shepherd was on carprofen.
I don't get it. These two victims were strangers.
So why is his sister's dog's hair in her lungs?
The murders are connected.
Ever see "Strangers on a train"?
Hitchcock.
Two strangers each want someone dead.
They agree to do it for each other.
The perfect murders.
You can't set up a perfect murder in today's world
without talking to each other.
We can connect them through e-mails
or texts or phone calls.
You can check, but I doubt you can find anything.
Remember what Rick said to us -- "Big brother's watching"?
He made sure that we couldn't make a link
between him and Leslie Cabot.
How?
Frost, check to see if Rick's dog is registered
at Leslie's dog park.
That's it, Jane.
Yeah. Both Merton and Jaco have dog tags
and used the park.
That's where they met. That's where they planned the murders.
And they probably agreed never to contact each other
unless it was at that dog park.
Smart.
Very.
All right, let's talk motive.
Why would Leslie want her brother dead?
She got fed up with doing all the work
while he took the credit?
Wait, wait. I found this in the minutes.
It was the one meeting Mark attended.
Last week, he had a secret vote
to remove a board member.
Who was the board member? Who wasn't at that meeting?
Leslie Cabot.
You think Leslie figured out that Mark was getting rid of her?
What about Rick Clark?
You think he wanted Rhonda dead because she let herself go?
Frost, can you do a search?
See if this graduate student plagiarized
the material on this drive.
Sure.
What do all university professors want?
Tenure.
That's right.
She got it. He didn't.
You think that's the motive? Jealousy?
Okay, this is odd. There it is.
The material on this drive was published in a sociology journal.
So, Peter's thesis was published a week after
she kicked him out of the program?
相似度 99.7%
Oh, look who claims he wrote it -- Rick Clark.
That's why Rhonda thought Peter plagiarized it --
She probably read Rick's article before it was published.
Well, tenure is all about publication.
So, Rick must have felt the pressure,
which means he was competing with his wife
for the same tenure slot.
I'll call the dean and find out.
Yeah, but we still don't have enough to arrest them.
Why not?
We don't have any evidence to connect them to the victims.
Yeah, were there other contenders in line for that tenure slot?
Yes. Yes. All right, thank you.
You were right -- Rick and Rhonda Clark were in line
for the same tenure spot.
Now that she's dead, it's his, isn't it?
The dean's gonna announce it today.
That's motive --
That and the fact that they "grew apart."
There has to be a way to get them, Jane.
Wait, there is.
Let's pit them against each other.
Mr. Clark? Yes, hello.
This is Detective Rizzoli.
Uh, we've found some security footage
from one of your neighbors.
Uh, we believe that it's your wife's killer,
but we can't identify her.
Would you be able to come down and look?
Yes, identify her.
Do you see Rick Clark or Leslie Cabot?
Not yet.
Thanks for doing this.
You know, you're not supposed to use your personal car for work.
It's new, and I like it,
And would you rather be sitting in a police car?
No.
Hey, Casey, you want to see a movie later?
Sure.
What are you doing?
I'm looking up movie listings.
Stay close, Casey. Company.
Hey, buddy.
That's not Leslie Cabot.
That's Jenny Cabot -- Mark's wife.
Well...Merton knows her. He's not barking.
Look at that -- those dogs are friends.
So they met here.
Talked dogs, bad marriages.
The police called me.
What?
One of my neighbors got you on their security camera.
What do you mean? They have a recording of me?
They haven't identified you yet.
If I'm going down, you're going down, too.
How could you not know your neighbor had a camera
aimed at your damn house?
Would you relax, okay? It'll be fine.
Yeah, fine for you, maybe.
I made sure there were no cameras.
Hell, I even got you the gun.
Which is where? Your house? Your car?
Dumbass.
In the ocean.
Oh. What about you, huh?
Did you tell your girlfriend
you weren't just taking her dog for a walk, huh?
You think Leslie maybe ought to know
that you had her brother killed
so that she could save her job.
Don't you dare.
Looks like Jenny married the wrong sibling.
Wonder if Mark knows
his wife was having an affair with his sister.
Let's go.
All right.
At least, I didn't have my wife killed so I could take her job.
I hated my wife.
Yeah, well, I hated my husb--
Funnily enough, that remains the number-one motive for murder.
We have some good news and some bad news.
The good news is --
we don't have you on security cameras, Jenny.
The bad news --
You see that dog over there with her collar?
That's a parabolic mic,
so we do have you both admitting to murder.
Oh, my god.
You said you wanted to live in Southie.
It's a good facility.
Just -- just leave me.
I'm fine. Leave me.
We'll visit you.
Why?
Because it's the right thing to do.
Because you're a lonely, angry, old gangster.
But you're also my grandfather,
and you don't have anybody else,
so take it before I change my mind.
You -- you look just like Paddy right now.
Maybe there is something to this biology thing.
So, blood is thicker than water.
The density of blood plasma in circulating blood cells
is roughly twice the density of water.
Oh, my goodness! Patrick!
There, see? He's gonna be fine.
Bunny?
Yes!
Patrick Doyle.
Look at you, James Dean.
Well, we grew up on the same block.
Casey's going back to Afghanistan.
For how long?
I don't know.
He said he hadn't decided whether to re-enlist.
He will, unless...
Unless, what?
Unless I marry him.
