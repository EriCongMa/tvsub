Alison?
Did you miss me?
There's someone Ali is so afraid of, she can't come back.
And CeCe's been busy
running from the cops 'cuz she killed Wilden.
I'm not waiting here forever,
and I sure as hell am not going back to Rosewood.
What is is?
I was hoping you could tell me.
I didn't write it.
You told the police.
But I don't think I could ever trust you again.
Goodbye.
Do you think that I had something to do with Ali's murder?
You're having a tough time with your withdrawal.
Ezra's not "A."
He's a writer, who found
a great opportunity to make a name for himself!
He used us!
I found some stuff out I think can really help you.
Ezra thinks that "A" is Ali's mom.
Mrs. DiLaurentis saw me pick up a shovel and go after Ali.
Mrs. DiLaurentis, we're not
certain that your daughter's in that grave.
Well, I am.
Answer it.
How did you find me?
Look, we want to help you,
but you need to tell us what happened that night.
Then you need to come here.
Alison, are you in there?
What are you doing here?
Spencer!
What?
Stay here.
I'll be right back.
I cannot believe we let Noel bring us here.
Do we think she's even coming?
I don't know, when I saw it was him instead of Ali,
I thought for sure this was a trap.
Probably is and we're just sitting here like geese.
Ducks.
What?
You sit like lame ducks. Not geese.
OK, well, whatever, they both quack.
Geese honk.
Why would Ali trust Noel Kahn?
Because he has secrets, too.
I want to hug you and slap you at the same time.
I could use a hug.
I'm glad you're here, Spencer.
Why? I'm the one you can't trust.
I need your help.
Now that the cops know that I'm not the one they buried,
they're gonna start looking again.
And until I know who "A" is, I can't come home.
Ali, we think your mom's the one
who stole the game from Mona.
We think she's "A."
You don't seem surprised.
It's complicated, Em.
I've never figured out
the right way to tell you what you need to know.
I've never been able to say the words out loud.
Why don't you start at the beginning?
I'm ready to tell you guys everything.
But if we can't figure it out tonight,
I'm gonna have to disappear again.
And this time it's gonna be for good.
Want some coffee?
Did you just get lucky or did someone turn me in?
Who would have done that?
Look, we know Wilden was a jerk.
He was on the take and willing
to rough people up to get what he wanted.
Maybe he took you out to that lake to scare you.
Things got out of hand and
you did what you needed to do to stop him.
Yeah, you're right.
Wilden was a jerk.
I thought you might want to help yourself out here.
But we can play it your way.
We also have an eyewitness that can place you at the scene.
We're just waiting for him to come in to I.D. you.
If I did do it, maybe I had a good reason for it.
I'm gonna need more than coffee
if you want to hear what happened.
We have you on the hook for a murder charge.
If you're looking to make a deal
I'm not sure what you have to bargain with.
I know who killed that girl.
The one they thought was Alison DiLaurentis.
What does that have to do with Wilden?
Maybe nothing. Maybe everything.
You're the cop. That's for you to figure out.
So who killed her?
The same person who's still trying to hurt my friend.
Which friend is that?
Alison. She's alive.
You've seen her?
More than once. And I can prove it.
So if you want me here to help you figure out who "A" is,
you must not think I'm the one who hurt you.
Let's not get ahead of ourselves, Spencer.
It was a crazy night
and it all starts in Hilton Head.
"A" had been threatening me since that Halloween.
I thought a weekend away with Ian would give me a reprieve.
Did you follow me here?
I know who you're with.
It's Alison.
Listen, she doesn't mean anything to me.
She's in there, isn't she?
You're with her, now.
Melissa--
Ian, I know she's here!
Ian, move!
Just... wait... Stop, stop!
Please, listen.
Just let me take care of this so we don't make a scene, OK?
I'm going to handle this!
Melissa--
How could you do this?
You can never see Alison again.
Fine, OK, I won't.
Because if you do, someone's gonna get hurt.
"Jenna and Toby?"
Melissa, you were the one who wanted to take a break.
I've just been killing time. Waiting for you to come back.
There's nothing wrong about us.
We're not even related.
I don't ever want to lose you again.
You won't.
I went there to get away from "A," but when I left,
I had what I needed to shut "A" down.
Those videos changed the game.
Jenna was at the top of my list. She had every reason to hate me.
She always had her little dog Garrett to do her dirty work.
Smile.
I thought you'd see it my way.
Oh, and, Jenna, if I get one more threat,
or you ever come back to Rosewood, I'll bury you.
今晚就是你的死期 -A
"Bitch can't see you, but I do.
Tonight's the night I kill you."
Knowing what I had on her, I mean,
Jenna would never have sent that text.
I was wrong.
She wasn't "A."
The police are here too, Ella.
With a search warrant.
Oh, it's Ashley Marin.
I'll call you back if she knows anything. OK.
Did you find Hanna?
I spoke to Pam.
No one's seen the girls since the fundraiser.
Peter's coming back from New York.
Get this into evidence.
Let's regroup when he gets here.
OK. Bye.
If you let me know what you're looking for
maybe I can help you find it.
We appreciate your cooperation.
I want to know where my daughter is.
So do I.
What is it you think these girls are guilty of?
I'm not sure they're guilty of anything,
but we do have probable cause to believe
they know the whereabouts of a missing person.
This was taken a few weeks ago.
Oh, my God. Alison is alive?
Spencer?
Surprise!
So when you got the text
you just crossed Jenna off your list?
And when I got home,
"A" made it clear that if she wanted to kill me, she could.
I wasn't safe anywhere.
But I finally had a weapon to fight back.
I realized that everyone I suspected...
...even the four of you,
were somehow compromised on those videos.
How could this happen?
I don't understand.
I don't want you going out tonight.
It's the last weekend of summer.
It's not a discussion.
We planned this ages ago, and you said it was OK.
Ali, now is not the time--
You have to send somebody. Immediately.
Is this about you thinking Spencer's the bully?
Because, I have that under control now.
I know things about that family that you don't.
Really, like what?
I've seen what they're capable of.
And you have to remember.
You can never turn your back on a Hastings.
For once in your life please don't push me on this.
Call it a night, go upstairs to your room.
Yes?
And is there any news?
Please hurry, I'm very, very worried.
Please send someone.
I see.
Yes. Yes!
Of course.
Gotcha!
That's so not funny, Alison.
I got you hilarious girls, so...
Ali, did you download the new Beyonce?
Not yet.
I'm loving her new video.
Maybe a little too much, Em.
Bad, huh?
Your turn.
Careful, Aria.
Take too much and you'll tell us all your secrets.
Friends share secrets. That's what keeps us close.
Drink up.
What do you want, Toby?
I can't believe you drugged us.
If I got another "A" threat while you guys were asleep,
I could cross you off the list.
I can't believe we were suspects.
I wasn't always the best friend to you guys.
Yeah, well, your plan didn't work.
I didn't sleep through the night.
Wait for it, Spencer. We'll get there.
So you work here?
The owner travels a lot.
I watch his place upstairs when he's gone.
Toby told me he wanted you to know you did him a favor.
He said he was free at last.
I know what you see in Toby, Spencer.
When he tells you the truth, you believe him.
He said his time in juvie got him away from Jenna,
and he was actually grateful to me.
That's how I knew he wasn't "A."
And it was the last time I saw him.
在接吻石见
Did we have a date that I forgot?
You lied to me.
I have somewhere to be.
No!
You're not going anywhere.
You said Spencer was as away for a few days last week.
Was she visiting family? Or a friend?
Are you questioning all the girls' parents?
We're doing everything we can to find your daughters.
You're free to leave whenever you like.
But you should know there's a sea of reporters out there.
You probably want to wait here until we can clear a path for you.
Fine, but I'd like to call my husband.
I'm not sure what's taking him so long.
I'll give you some privacy.
I got the warrant to track
the GPS on the girls' phones and Spencer's car.
We'll have their location within the hour.
Good, keep me posted.
I've always looked out for my sister.
So when I ran into her boyfriend in London,
and he said she missed me, I decided to come home.
Miss Hastings, do you mind if I record this?
I should probably ask my mom about that.
Your wife is on her way.
She knows I'm here, right?
She has got enough to worry about with Spencer missing.
Do you have any idea where your daughter is?
If I did, would I be sitting here talking with you?
Is that something they taught you in law school?
To answer questions with questions?
You're not a parent, are you?
See, the only reason I'm talking to you
is because my daughter is missing.
So why don't you tell me what you're doing to find her.
You've got cash, a passport, and a plane ticket.
We need to leave for the airport in an hour.
Thank you.
You guys, we can't let her leave, again.
Then we have to put together the pieces.
Tonight.
Ali... look I understand we're here to figure out who "A" is,
but I need to know if Ezra told me the truth.
Ezra seemed to get that everything I said was made-up stuff.
But he believed me when I said that CeCe and I
were roommates at UPenn.
We hung out a lot at this pub near Hollis.
That's where I met Ezra.
Excuse me, can I have a gin and tonic?
Thanks.
It's tragic, isn't it?
Oh, sorry?
The book. It's one of my favorites.
I read it every summer.
I just finished it for the third time.
What's better to read the Tender is the Night
while you're sunning in the French Riviera?
Do people still do that?
Do what?
Go sunning in the French Riviera?
I don't know. I made it up.
So, you're a bit of a fabulist.
What does that mean?
A teller of tales.
Sometimes lies are more interesting than the truth.
He said I reminded him of
Holly Golightly in Breakfast at Tiffany's.
He wanted to write a story about me.
Do we need to hear the rest of this?
I thought it was a compliment
because Audrey Hepburn played her in the movie,
but turns out she was a big phony
who couldn't even name her cat.
She didn't name her cat because
she didn't think she deserved to be loved.
They were just a couple of poor no-name slobs.
I'm sorry, Aria.
For what?
Everything.
Look, it is one thing to
make up stories about how you spent your summer,
but to lie to a guy and say that you're 21,
when you're still in high school--
What's the big deal? We didn't do anything, Ezra.
That's not the point.
Then what are you so freaked out about?
God help me, Alison, I actually like you.
I just don't want to see you get hurt.
You're an all right guy.
See you around.
No. You won't.
If you ever get your story published,
you better spell my name right.
And then I walked to the Kissing Rock to see Ian.
Thanks for meeting me. That was some goodbye kiss.
No hard feelings, right?
Please. This was just me killing time,
while I'm waiting for someone better to come along.
Look... why don't we just end this
on a positive note, OK?
You and Melissa deserve each other. She's such a bitch.
Hey, watch your mouth.
And you're going to jail.
You know, we never had sex, Alison.
So, I didn't do anything wrong.
I saw your home movies, Ian.
What does N.A.T. Stand for anyway? Need A Therapist?
Listen, you are not gonna blackmail me into staying with you.
That's hilarious. This isn't about you.
Someone's threatening me. And if it's you,
or your crazy girlfriend, it stops tonight.
Because I've made a copy of every single video on your laptop.
If I get one more text or stupid doll,
you're going to be buying your soap on a rope.
You have no idea how much trouble you're going to be in,
if you show those videos to anyone.
Look at me!
There are things on here that could bring everybody down.
Including your family.
Well, I guess you better go back to that posse of pervs
and tell them to leave me alone.
Ian was more freaked out than I thought he was going to be.
I mean, He took off out of there like a plucked peacock.
Geez, Hanna!
Sorry.
Aria, you OK?
Yeah.
Ezra's still looking for me, Aria.
But it's not about the book now, it's about you.
What would you know about that?
He found Shana in Georgia.
He knows that we were in touch, and he offered to help.
He thinks if he saves me, he'll win you back.
Do you even want to be saved?
I know how I treated people.
I deserved a lot of what I got.
I think I deserve a second chance.
What happened after Ian left?
I went back to the barn.
I've been waiting for you.
Would you see if my wife is here, please?
Absolutely. Just one more thing, though.
Why did you hire a private detective
the summer Alison went missing?
It was business related.
You sure it wasn't Spencer related?
Her name is all over the file he gave you.
I thought this was about finding Spencer,
not accusing her of something.
In hindsight you knew it was the drugs,
that must have been a rough summer.
With Spencer's erratic behavior and violent outbursts.
OK, we're done here. I'm calling my attorney.
Cell reception's better in the lobby.
We have all of our resources committed to finding your daughter.
We should have more information for you soon.
Thank you.
We got a lock on Spencer's GPS. The girls are in Philadelphia.
Get Philly PD on the phone.
I'll be right back.
Jessica?
Police are asking pointed questions about Spencer.
Do we still have an understanding?
I just found out that my daughter is still alive, Peter.
That's all I'm thinking about right now.
Mrs. DiLaurentis, can we talk to you?
Dad?
Melissa? What are you doing here?
Toby came to London.
He told me about Spencer's relapse.
Dad, what's going on?
Where is your mother?
We've been here for an hour.
They asked to talk to us separately.
God, they know.
I must have missed something.
I did everything I could to protect her.
Oh, my God.
Dad, you think she did it?
You think Spencer killed that girl.
I... I remember bits and pieces.
But I'm not sure what's real and what I've made up.
I was pushing all summer for you to tell Melissa about Ian
because I wanted to break them up.
I thought that Ian actually liked me
and that Melissa was in the way.
And we got in a fight in the kitchen. And it got ugly.
It was like you bottled up every fight we ever had
and popped your top that night.
I thought that you were still threatening me.
I told you I would tell Melissa the truth.
And I told you to forget it,
but you were holding on to it like a dog with a bone.
Hey, this conversation isn't over!
It is over, Spencer. And so are we.
Don't you walk away from me.
Damn it, Alison. I said, stop!
You're way out of your league, Spencer.
Am I? You sure about that?
Why don't you put that thing down before you hurt yourself?
Are you speeding?
When I saw the pills, I put it together.
You weren't asleep because you were wired.
Spencer.
Spencer!
Spencer... Spencer, wait!
What?!
Please don't tell anybody.
Please look, I'll do anything, OK.
I'll get down on my hands and knees.
I'll beg you if that's what you want me to.
Please!
Stop.
Spencer, look at me.
Don't take any more of these tonight, OK?
And never take them with alcohol.
If my parents find out--
They won't.
It'll be our secret.
Thank you.
That's what friends are for.
Go back and just sleep it off, OK?
And after that there was just one more person I needed to see.
Your dad, Aria.
You know how much it will hurt Aria if you make that call.
I don't think that you're that horrible of a person.
Well, then you clearly don't know me that well.
I didn't think Byron was "A."
But I needed him to know that I had the tapes.
Then I went back to the barn and waited for another text.
Nothing came.
I went home thinking I won. I silenced "A."
It wasn't you, Spencer.
You were sound asleep when I left the barn.
Yeah, but... That doesn't mean I didn't hurt the other girl.
You're not listening, Spence. You went back to sleep.
I didn't do it.
But your mom saw who did.
Why didn't she tell the police?
I could hear her talking to someone.
She thought I was dead.
I was trying to tell her I was alive.
I was screaming.
"Can't you see me?
Can't you see me breathing? Look at me!"
But the words didn't come out. I couldn't move.
Ali, we're here for you. All right, we're all here for you.
And we always have been. You should have told us.
You didn't have to keep this a secret.
God, I can't believe your mom buried you alive.
Are you sure she thought you were dead?
She was hysterical.
She kept saying the same thing, over and over again.
"What have you done? What have you done?"
Who was she talking to?
The person she's still protecting.
That's why she was pointing the finger at me
because she's still covering for somebody.
Yeah, but who?
Was Mrs. Grunwald telling the truth
when she said she pulled you out of there?
She took me to the hospital.
I was so scared, so I ran.
I didn't know where I was going. I just knew I had to go.
Alison?
Oh, my God. Are you OK?
I still can't believe somebody tried to kill you.
Nobody followed us, right? They can't know that we're here.
I registered with the name you told me to use.
Vivian Darkbloom.
I'm scared for you, Alison.
I'm scared for me, too.
If this "A" person
who's after you was willing to bash your head in,
what's stopping them from trying again?
Nothing.
Maybe you should die.
What?
Let "A" think you're dead.
How do I do that?
You disappear.
You should rest.
Come on. I got you.
There you go.
Everything's going to work out
exactly the way it's supposed to. You'll see.
I'll take care of you.
Pretty girl.
Did I get everything you need?
Ali?
You saved my life, Mona.
I don't know how I can thank you.
Thank me by staying gone. And staying safe.
Come here.
Look at yourself.
Ditch the glasses and the barrettes.
Have Kim at The Salon do your hair
and ask for Cindy at the make-up counter.
Buy everything she tells you to
and never go to school without your face on.
Now, burn those knee socks,
tell Mandi at The Boutique that Vivian sent you.
You don't have to be a loser, Mona.
Thanks, Ali.
Mona played me like a fool. And she got exactly what she wanted.
Mom's talking to Sandra King.
She's the best criminal defense lawyer in the state.
Dad, Spencer didn't kill that girl.
Thank you, Sandra, I appreciate it.
Mrs. Hastings, we just heard from the Philadelphia police.
They're only a few minutes away.
I don't think we're going to figure this out tonight.
But you shouldn't leave, Ali.
We know everything now. We can protect you.
We know everything except who "A" is.
But if the five... if we stick together--
I can't go back until I figure out
why my mom was willing to do that to me.
Ali, come on, you can't leave.
Don't you want to come home?
It was surprisingly easy for me to stay gone.
Until you got hurt, Hanna.
I was so scared that you were going to die.
It was worth the risk.
When I saw you in the hospital...
When I saw what Mona did to you...
...I decided to stop running.
I tried to keep one step ahead of "A,"
and I did everything I could to keep you safe.
Please. If you love my sister you won't do this.
I'm doing it because I love her.
What are you doing here?
Ian wasn't dead. I was waiting in the back and I saw him.
Were you at the Lodge the night of the fire?
I helped you, Hanna. By the time I got there,
the rest of you were already safe.
Did you see who pulled us out?
Guys, I think someone's out there.
Is that Noel?
Get the plate number?
We have an 11-57 on the Hastings vehicle
but the suspects are not at the scene.
I repeat, the suspects are not at the scene.
Ali, run!
Go!
Oh, my God!
Lock the door!
Call 911!
Noel has our phones!
Fire escape! Fire escape!
Hurry!
Get out of here.
Oh, my God!
He's right behind us!
Hurry!
It's locked!
There's no way out of here.
Do you think we can make it?
No!
Ezra?
Hey, hey! Hey.
Look, I know who you are. And the police are on their way.
Ezra!
Oh, my God.
Take off your mask!
Now!
Take it off!
No!
There's no way that's your mom.
Ezra?
It's so beautiful.
No! No...
Oh, my God. Oh, my...
Oh, my God! Ezra!
I'm sorry...
Shhh. Don't.
You stay awake, do you hear me? Don't you dare close your eyes!
No, please! Ezra!
Somebody call for help!
Oh, my God. Ezra! Ezra!
Oh, my God!
