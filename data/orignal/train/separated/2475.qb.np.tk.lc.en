damon , no offense ,
but i don &apos;t want things to go back to the way they were .
i have two little girls that i absolutely love
and a fiancée that makes me feel so lucky to be alive .
you weren &apos;t even gonna say good @-@ bye .
i wrote you a letter .
i &apos;m not okay with you choosing yourself .
and i &apos;m not okay with never seeing you ever again .
bonnie &apos;s undercover at a psych ward in asheville .
there &apos;s a vault in the basement of the armory .
what &apos;s in the vault ?
something that can &apos;t be let out .
i need to know if the effects of those pills can be reversed .
the effects of my blood can &apos;t be reversed .
you know what would be a terrible shame ?
is if that person were a witch .
say bonnie bennett .
&apos;cause that would mean you just gave the girl you love
a death sentence .
i thought i was protecting you .
i &apos;m gonna die ?
i will not let you die , bonnie bennett .
bonnie ,
i ...
what is going on ?
alex told the armory to bring you in .
i &apos;m not gonna let them .
thank you .
thank me when this is over , luv .
do you feel well enough to travel ?
&apos;cause the minute those anti @-@ magic pills wear off ,
alex will be able to track you again .
i feel fine .
i don &apos;t feel sick at all .
i don &apos;t understand any of this .
ah , luv .
come here .
and i can &apos;t believe this is happening .
it &apos;s not .
this is just a ...
a series of unfortunate events
leading up to your ultimate salvation .
i swear it .
do i have to open the door ?
he wants to help .
and if i &apos;m being completely honest , we could use it .
great .
i have an idea .
no . you don &apos;t speak to me .
you speak to enzo .
if you have any ideas how to keep me from dying ,
i &apos;m sure he &apos;ll be happy to hear them ,
but i don &apos;t want to hear one word from your mouth directed at me .
you lost the right to my attention
when you decided to leave without saying good @-@ bye .
you &apos;re driving .
he can follow .
look , whatever &apos;s gone wrong ,
i really can &apos;t do another escapade today .
no . no escapades , no scar , no running from rayna .
and thank you for your help with that , by the way .
not like i had a choice , but ... you &apos;re welcome .
so , anyway , i was actually hoping to , uh ,
speak to caroline .
she &apos;s not here right now .
do you think i could ... ?
yeah .
yeah , sure . come on .
thanks .
you know , the odds of us getting through this
without a single word being spoken ...
lots of words can be spoken .
just don &apos;t want him to speak any to me .
i thought we &apos;d gotten past the anger stage .
we had .
we were blissfully not angry
because we had blissfully moved on from damon
and his selfish , narcissistic existence , but when someone
who you have erased from your mind
has the audacity to show up at your door with flowers ,
and not even your favorite flowers ...
... not even your favorite flowers , by the way ,
anger returns , anger floods .
i &apos;m flooded .
well , this is ... quaint .
we &apos;ll be safe here for a few hours .
i &apos;ve kept this place off the grid for years .
lonely , cramped , like a prison cell .
i can see why you like it .
you know what ?
he &apos;s welcome to go back to his musty old mansion
far away from here .
miss the chance to see this den of iniquity ? no .
cozy .
it &apos;s a big step , moving in with someone .
all right , let &apos;s do this .
where are you hiding that pesky little huntress ?
storm cellar .
follow me .
motus .
get off !
you &apos;re not a prisoner , bonnie .
i &apos;m trying to keep you safe .
yeah ? you got a funny way of showing it !
secluded cabin ? anti @-@ magic sedatives ?
yeah , it &apos;s to keep you hidden from the armory .
all right ?
look , i don &apos;t know why they want you ,
but they want you , and in my experience ,
when they &apos;re being dodgy about what they want ,
it &apos;s because they want it for dodgy purposes .
i thought you worked for them .
no , my allegiance is to myself .
simpler that way .
what you should want to know is why you &apos;re important to alex .
now , in exchange for protection ,
plus complimentary room and board ,
you &apos;re gonna do some research for me , college girl .
sift through these and
figure out why the armory is so desperate to get their hands on you .
can enzo not read ?
while i &apos;m away , keeping up appearances with them ,
if you take one of these every day , you &apos;ll be safe .
hidden from locator spells .
if i don &apos;t ?
i &apos;m sure alex has a cozy little cell waiting for you .
why are you doing this ?
maybe i &apos;d rather see you alive than dead .
maybe i &apos;m just curious about what the armory &apos;s plans are .
or maybe i &apos;m just showing you common decency .
i can tell you &apos;re not used to that .
okay .
say i take you up on this protection , for now .
if i stay here ...
i set the ground rules .
i expect nothing less .
what the hell &apos;s wrong with her ?
her brain is full of visions .
she &apos;s still got a mystical connection to all those vampires
who escaped the phoenix stone .
it &apos;s made her a little loony .
i &apos;m right in front of you .
you don &apos;t have to talk about me in the third person .
all right , all right ,
kooky @-@ pants .
we &apos;re here to broker a deal .
i already told enzo i don &apos;t know how to help your friend .
yes , and enzo &apos;s the kind of guy who &apos;d take no for an answer .
me , on the other hand ,
i &apos;m stubborn , i &apos;m willful , i &apos;m bossy .
i usually get what i want .
so let me ask you this .
what if you had a little help
brooming out those runaway prisoners ?
a hit squad , if you will , hmm ?
i &apos;m listening .
well , me and my pal enzo here would be
happy to wipe out anyone off your list
in exchange for a teensy @-@ weensy favor .
and what might that be ?
oh , basically ...
we want you to die .
not my definition of &quot; favor . &quot;
enzo , tell the lady why this is such an amazing trade .
you &apos;re on your last mortal life .
i &apos;m aware .
now what we &apos;d like to do is to take that shamanic life and
transfer it to bonnie .
we think it will heal her .
what if you &apos;re wrong ?
bonnie thinks it will work .
she &apos;s very well @-@ read on this stuff .
if i give up my link to the everlasting , i &apos;ll die .
yep . but if you don &apos;t , i &apos;ll kill the everlasting ,
and you &apos;ll die anyway .
look , at least this way you get to be a good samaritan .
is this really your best sales pitch ?
all right ,
ignore him . he &apos;s the bad cop , i &apos;m the good cop .
here &apos;s what i &apos;ve got to offer .
okay .
you &apos;ve been chasing vampires every day of your eight lives .
every day .
then a couple of renegade heretics went and blew up the phoenix stone ,
and now a bunch of its prisoners are out in the wind again .
so for the rest of your remaining days , you will have to
chase those vampires to the ends of the earth
until you &apos;re too old and too weak ,
and , you know what , you &apos;ll probably die before you can finish the task
you &apos;ve been compelled by destiny to complete .
or you can let us do your dirty work over the next few days ,
and you can die with quiet in your mind ,
peace , and a smile on your face .
prove it .
prove what ?
prove that you can kill the ones on my list in progress .
clear them from my head .
when i can think better ,
i &apos;ll consider your deal .
great . give me the list .
you couldn &apos;t , uh ,
maybe use one of those psychic connections
to conjure up a google map or anything , huh ?
the way i see it , those pills you &apos;ve been using on bonnie
will wear off in the next 48 hours ,
and the armory will come calling for her .
that &apos;s if the withdrawal doesn &apos;t escalate her illness .
and those vampires could be anywhere .
you &apos;d better get started .
look .
the girls are growing up so fast .
they look like footballs in pumpkin costumes .
what have you got there ?
blueprints of the armory &apos;s underground levels .
you ever been down there ?
no , actually .
uh , alex said they were all sealed off .
i wonder what &apos;s down there .
the armory collects things , right ?
every museum has an archive
where they keep the really good stuff .
what sort of good stuff ?
i don &apos;t know . unique things .
one @-@ of @-@ a @-@ kind things . the outliers of a collection .
outliers ?
i mean , maybe that &apos;s why they wanted elena .
a doppelganger .
and rayna cruz .
a shamanic huntress with multiple lives .
and me .
a terrible guitar player .
you still haven &apos;t burned this bloody letter ?
every day i mean to , and every day i decide not to .
you know , he left me , too .
damon .
we were best mates ,
side by side in augustine cells for five years ,
each other &apos;s only friend .
we gave each other hope .
and then , one day ,
instead of implementing an escape plan we formulated together ,
he left me in a burning cage to die .
so ...
believe me when i tell you that i know how you feel .
and , look , let me just spare you the 50 years of mental anguish .
it &apos;s not you , it &apos;s him .
it &apos;s just who damon is .
so stop wasting your time
trying to figure out if it &apos;s something you did .
someone like you ,
with all that fire and passion and ...
loyalty ,
you deserve much , much better than that .
care and the girls left in a hurry .
trying to stay under the radar
till this rayna thing blows over .
no , no , it &apos;s , uh ... it &apos;s nice .
yeah , thanks . you &apos;d be amazed what you can accomplish
when your fiancée can compel an interior designer
and an entire homeowners &apos; association .
thought you were , uh , out of the game .
what do you mean ?
well , the ... supernatural world .
oh , yeah , we are .
but have you ever dealt with a homeowners &apos; association ?
no , no . can &apos;t say that i have .
uh , look , uh , i &apos;d offer you something ,
but i haven &apos;t been to the store in a while ,
so unless you want a juice box or some string cheese ,
i suggest we go somewhere else .
i could probably use something stronger .
ground control to rayna cruz .
what &apos;s our mission ?
i &apos;m sending you back towards texas ,
where the hellstone got destroyed .
think of that as the ... center of the blast .
vampire souls scattered out in all directions ,
landing every which way .
i can see the places they go
and the people they kill ,
things they see with their eyes .
your next target is in richmond .
inside a bright , clean room .
oh , yeah . i know exactly where that is .
please tell us you &apos;re gonna give us more clues than that .
you will , as they come to me .
i ... i know it &apos;s not a lot to go on ,
but i &apos;m hoping we can put together enough
so that you guys can prove your effectiveness .
you guys hearing this ?
sorry , i &apos;m just having a lot of difficulty
wrapping my head around this new ...
cooperative team leader version of you .
you &apos;ve always hated us .
yeah , but i &apos;m tired , you know ?
multiple lifetimes @-@ tired .
you realize that in over 100 years on this planet ,
i &apos;ve never had even one day off .
i just want a day
without vampires .
one free day where i can ...
feel the sun on my face , eat a cheeseburger ,
watch the ocean .
enjoy a few simple pleasures , for once .
and then go to sleep .
tell you what , why don &apos;t we circle back to the situation at hand .
where are you sending us next ?
i &apos;m seeing a lot of teeth .
i hope word of this doesn &apos;t get out .
people already hate going to the dentist .
his heart &apos;s not in his ankle , bonnie .
shut up . this thing has a kick .
now .
uh , that wasn &apos;t so hard .
what ?
it &apos;s new year &apos;s eve .
get up . we &apos;re having dinner .
oh , and for the love of god ,
please put on something besides these abhorrent sweatpants .
what do you care about my sweatpants ?
i &apos;m instituting a dress code .
for the holiday .
this is the best i could do ...
i thought you deserved a proper celebration .
if you would &apos;ve told me a year ago
we would be spending new year &apos;s eve together ,
i would have called you crazy .
well , you &apos;ve called me far worse than that in the past .
so i was thinking about your cousin .
whatever you want to call her-- alex .
how you said she never wanted to discuss her siblings .
but her sister virginia &apos;s journal talks about how close they were .
what else does virginia say ?
kind of off @-@ balance .
seems to hate everything your family stands for .
well , at least she knows what that is .
i &apos;m still trying to figure it out .
why do you care ?
they abandoned you .
left you at a workhouse .
you have two parents , right ?
oh , sorry . um , had .
i know your dad died .
i had none .
curiosity about what they stand for
is what keeps me from hating them for leaving me .
what ?
nothing .
what ?
nothing .
just , after all this time ,
i think i &apos;m finally starting to understand you .
may i have this dance ?
really ?
why the hell not ?
so , when i was reading the journal ...
enough research for one day .
it &apos;s all i have to occupy me .
yeah ?
all ?
not all .
not counting guitar practice .
eh , getting better .
and the fire @-@ building .
you are nearly an expert .
and now this .
old people dancing .
quite ... so .
as lovely as this evening has been , i really must get going .
it &apos;s not even midnight yet .
but i &apos;ve already stayed too long .
if i don &apos;t show up , alex will wonder where i am .
forgot .
being a double agent must be a full @-@ time job .
happy new year .
happy new year .
order up .
you &apos;re not gonna answer that ?
damon and i are on a bit of a time @-@ out .
really ? and after all that trouble
he went through to get that psychopath out of your body .
well , he &apos;s half the reason that psychopath
was in my body in the first place .
these last few days have been a painful reminder
of the complicated nature of our relationship .
okay , stefan .
what happened ?
three years ago , you told caroline
you &apos;d be with her when things were safe .
rayna got locked up ... and you never showed .
well , that &apos;s not exactly how it went down .
well , that &apos;s how it went down for caroline .
there &apos;s more to the story .
nothing you felt like sharing ?
not at the time , no .
but now ... now you &apos;re ready .
right . that &apos;s why you &apos;re here .
i mean , forget you couldn &apos;t manage even a postcard
these last three years ,
but now that she &apos;s built a new life ,
there &apos;s a wedding on the books ,
and you &apos;re just popping in to share your side of the story .
look , i made a choice back then ,
and i think that she deserves to know what and why .
wow , that &apos;s ...
really nice of you , stefan , you know ?
because i think she deserved to know the what and why ,
you know , before you stopped calling .
it broke her heart .
will you just answer the damn phone , please ?
what ?
where are you ?
i &apos;m trying to pick up the pieces of my broken life ,
and something tells me you &apos;re about to disrupt that .
gold @-@ star guess , brother .
listen , i need some well @-@ armed backup .
any chance you can get your hands on a vamp arsenal ?
probably . why ?
long story . it involves rayna
and some pretty nasty phoenix stone vamps and , uh ...
i &apos;m trying to save someone who hates me .
which one ? there are so many .
bonnie &apos;s in trouble , stefan .
now , i know you don &apos;t owe me anything ,
but i really need the help .
i &apos;m with ric . just tell us what we can do .
fore .
this bonnie and clyde and clyde routine
is starting to improve your aim .
i just picture your face as the target .
been looking for you , cousin .
i &apos;m flattered .
not too hard to find you ,
seeing as you &apos;ve left a trail of vampire corpses
across the southeast .
before you think about hurting me ,
my team knows where i am .
one text from me , and they &apos;ll storm the entire building .
somehow i don &apos;t think you want that .
well , it makes no difference to me . i &apos;m in here alone .
doing what ?
shopping for chairs , of course .
you can &apos;t keep hiding her from me .
i don &apos;t control bonnie &apos;s movements .
so , it was her idea to go undercover at the psychiatric ward ?
there was an incident at my sister &apos;s hospital yesterday .
i was notified with all the details .
virginia often has violent episodes .
that &apos;s why i had her committed .
after she killed lucy bennett .
you didn &apos;t know ?
why on earth would i know that ?
four years ago , virginia forced lucy to seal a vault
in the armory with magic .
only problem was our other sister yvette
was still inside when they closed it .
i need to get her out .
bonnie can help me do that .
i ... sorry , i don &apos;t mean to be callous ,
but unless that vault has a well @-@ stocked kitchen ,
i &apos;m afraid your sister has died of starvation .
you &apos;re wrong .
something has kept her alive in there .
i can hear her voice calling to me for help .
it &apos;s my fault that she &apos;s suffering .
i know you understand that kind of guilt .
i am sure that you did not come here
so we could discuss our feelings .
your situation is untenable .
you care for a girl that probably doesn &apos;t have long to live .
i need that girl to perform a simple spell
so i can put our family back together .
i feel like you and i
could solve each other &apos;s problems , lorenzo .
bring me bonnie bennett ,
and i will do everything i can to save her life .
enzo &apos;s a big boy . he can take care of himself .
i don &apos;t want to talk to you .
look , bonnie , had alex seen you ,
she would have called in her swat team
and all this would have been for nothing .
we had to jet .
i &apos;m tired , damon .
and i don &apos;t feel good and i &apos;m worried about enzo ,
so stop trying so hard , okay ?
please tell me you &apos;re all right .
don &apos;t worry about me , luv .
our cousin alex only wanted to have a chat ,
and then she let me go .
that &apos;s not sketchy at all .
agreed .
is she still looking for me ?
of course .
yeah , she &apos;s still banging on about this vault
and how we should both work together .
you know , i actually think she &apos;s being sincere .
and here i thought your new boyfriend
was actually smarter than your last one .
we don &apos;t trust her , damon .
no ,
not for a second .
she &apos;s closing in .
so , look , after i wrestle myself a car ,
i &apos;ll meet back up with you
and we &apos;ll get back to rayna &apos;s list , all right ?
hello ? you still there ?
yeah . just one problem .
from what you know about the sickness ,
how much time do i have left after the , uh ,
first scab appears ?
a week , maybe less .
i only heard two dogs howling at the noise .
hilarious , as always .
you stayed away long enough .
yeah . been busy at work .
have me traveling more than i hoped .
i trust your other pastimes
have borne more results than your guitar ?
well , the fireplace is burning perfectly .
and i found something in virginia &apos;s diary .
oh , yeah ?
yeah .
she knew my cousin , lucy bennett .
it &apos;s a bill from a psychiatric hospital
in asheville , north carolina .
virginia &apos;s been a patient there for the past three years .
she might have an idea about why the bennett bloodline
is so important to alex .
color me impressed .
new year , new me .
a new mastery over an instrument .
no ?
let me show you .
i was doing it .
not really . here .
this is it .
okay .
you want to loosen up your hands .
in there .
and strum .
yeah , now back to the one chord .
right . there you go .
that &apos;s it .
you wanted to get out of the house .
don &apos;t be ridiculous .
come now , surely this qualifies as a date ,
nice try .
yeah ?
talk to me .
about anything , please .
i need new pictures in my head .
trees . sky .
vervain grenades .
much better . thank you .
how &apos;s bonnie doing ?
not as well as she &apos;s pretending to be .
how &apos;s ric holding up ?
he &apos;s circling around the next campsite
to lay cover fire on any egress routes .
i don &apos;t know . his words , not mine .
so he &apos;s having fun .
he &apos;s only tolerating me
because we &apos;re doing this for bonnie .
and if this is how ric feels ,
imagine how much worse it &apos;s gonna be with caroline .
lighten up . anything &apos;s possible .
i mean , look , take me and bon @-@ bon , for instance .
getting better every day .
whoa , i got to jump .
rayna &apos;s got a bead on our nasty little runaways .
it &apos;s go time .
let &apos;s get &apos; er done .
lorenzo , don &apos;t .
i &apos;m a friend .
sorry . i don &apos;t know you .
of course you don &apos;t recognize me in this body .
it &apos;s me-- beau .
beau the heretic ?
small world .
well , welcome back .
and good @-@ bye .
don &apos;t kill him .
he &apos;s on the list , bonnie .
it &apos;s not up for debate .
he helped save caroline &apos;s life .
and her kids .
i &apos;m not gonna let you murder him .
oh , come on . really ?
wait , whoa , whoa , whoa . take a walk .
get a half @-@ caf soy ...
and you still don &apos;t even know my drink .
and by the time you get back ,
old yeller will already be taken out to the barn .
this is so like you .
which part ?
classic analogies ?
or that i don &apos;t ask permission to do what needs to be done ?
what if bleeding heart bonnie doesn &apos;t want to take out the next one ?
well , this sounds like the beginning of an accusation .
in case you forgot ,
sparing beau would &apos;ve been a huge deal breaker .
well , it &apos;s a good thing you took care of him , then .
that &apos;s what i do .
i take care of things . and people .
i don &apos;t give them pills that kill them
and let their own stupid judgment
put their lives in danger even more .
no . no , you &apos;re just gonna lie down in a coffin ,
hope that when you wake up ,
the mess you made will be cleaned up .
i made a mistake .
you made a choice .
i desiccated because i didn &apos;t want to hurt my friends .
but i am holding you personally responsible
if anything happens to bonnie .
i will hunt you down
and rip your heart out of your chest .
damon !
it &apos;s his fault , bonnie , all of it .
do you really believe that ?
there &apos;s no other factor you can think of ?
you want to hear me say i made a mistake , huh ?
okay , fine .
i made a mistake three years ago , bonnie .
i shouldn &apos;t have given up .
i shouldn &apos;t have run away !
but you did .
and i got over it .
yet you still carry my letter with you .
yeah .
yeah , i keep it .
keep it as a reminder to not trust the wrong people .
well , you &apos;re not doing too well , sister .
enzo here ...
enzo has been there for me !
every single day .
hiding me .
protecting me .
poisoning you !
he &apos;ll figure it out !
and what if he doesn &apos;t ?
then i &apos;ll die !
but at least i &apos;ll do it with him by my side .
i love him , damon .
and i know that no matter what happens ,
he won &apos;t leave me .
this part i really don &apos;t miss .
yeah , but the part where you helped bonnie ,
that wasn &apos;t too terrible , was it ?
don &apos;t .
don &apos;t what ?
don &apos;t try to get the band back together .
yes , all hands are on deck right now ,
but that doesn &apos;t make us friends
or earn you a place back in caroline &apos;s life , okay ?
well ...
i think that &apos;s something that she &apos;s gonna have to decide for herself .
you know , you &apos;re wasting your time , stefan .
let me tell you a little story .
when we moved to dallas ,
caroline joined a book club .
you know , it seemed like a good idea .
at first , it was once a week .
and then it was twice a week .
then she started coming home later and later .
so one night i followed her .
sounds healthy .
the point is this .
there was no book club .
turns out , she &apos;d park her car down by the river
so she could cry , alone .
and then something happened .
she stopped making excuses to be somewhere else .
and the girls and i stopped being a placeholder .
and we became her life .
i get all that .
no .
no , you don &apos;t , stefan .
she doesn &apos;t want to see you .
trust me .
you know her pretty well , huh ?
better than anyone now .
so who sleeps in the second bedroom ?
excuse me ?
well , i was at your house .
i saw the nursery for the twins .
and i also saw two separate bedrooms .
and then i saw an appointment for a justice of the peace ,
which doesn &apos;t seem very caroline forbes .
so tell me .
after you get home from city hall on friday ,
is that when she &apos;s gonna start sleeping in your bed ?
that &apos;s none of your business .
you can make look your relationship look good on paper ,
but deep down , it &apos;s a lie .
i know she doesn &apos;t love me .
but our life is not a lie .
all i can do is be worthy of her ,
stefan .
which is more than you &apos;ve ever been .
not to be a crybaby , but ...
these feel a lot worse than they look .
don &apos;t think i &apos;ll get much playing in .
aw , that &apos;s a shame , luv .
you &apos;re in dire need of practice .
go ahead , go ahead .
no , you &apos;re trying to look .
gonna make you ...
go ahead .
impressive .
no , you &apos;re peeking !
you &apos;re totally peeking .
no , i can see you &apos;re side @-@ eyeing the guitar .
don &apos;t mind me . i &apos;m just gonna
go get the next name out of the job jar .
ric .
oh , you got to be kidding me .
look , this didn &apos;t go how i wanted it to , all right ?
really ? you think you can just show up here
and everything &apos;s just gonna magically work itself ... ?
caroline .
we just got back .
mommy , read us a story .
yeah , in a minute , honey .
i can put them to bed if you want to talk .
no .
no , i got it .
happy you &apos;re home .
what &apos;s wrong ?
remember how rayna was gonna give bonnie her last life
after we finished her hit list ?
well , the good news is
she finally said yes to that deal .
the not @-@ as @-@ good news is
she added a few more names to the list .
