hey , dad .
what do you think of the picture on my new costco card ?
wow , you &apos;ve never put your actual face that close to mine .
jay thinks that --
let him answer .
okay , you look good .
this looks nothing like me !
maybe &apos; cause you &apos;re not yelling in it .
i look at this , and i &apos;m like ,
&quot; what the hell ? where &apos;s the sparkle ?
where &apos;s the guy that scored the winning touchdown
and was carried off by his team ? &quot;
this guy looks like he was carried off by the current .
i have half a mind
to cut this up and never go back there .
maybe you can use one of the scissors
from the eight @-@ pack that we bought .
hey , jay , you feeling it ?
you ready to knock down some pins ?
oh , great .
gray and wrinkled , like my tired puss .
it &apos;s my league finals ,
and jay agreed to fill in for our star bowler , maurice ,
who &apos;s recovering from a groin pull .
an actual groin pull ,
not the party on fire island .
i don &apos;t know , cameron .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m really not feeling it tonight .
well , you better start feeling it soon .
we need to win
so i can stick it to that smug martin sherman .
who &apos;s martin sherman ?
only my archrival .
i thought your rival
was that blond christmas caroler .
no , it &apos;s the spanish teacher at his school .
well , c @-@ cam has lots of rivals ,
especially if you count that bag boy .
i told you -- never say his name .
i didn &apos;t say his name . i don &apos;t even know his name .
it &apos;s todd .
always putting my canned goods on top of my produce .
i &apos;d like to squash his squash .
okay , let &apos;s go .
hopefully , we won &apos;t be out too late tonight .
we will !
oh , yeah , right .
$ 10 says you guys will be home in bed before we are .
no , no , no , no , no .
you two will be sleeping ,
and gloria and haley and i will still be dancing .
this one ? joe tucks her in .
how would you know ?
you go to bed right after
you get mad at the news .
yeah , it &apos;s you two that are keeping us down ,
but not tonight .
tonight , we are going out big .
oh , yeah !
yes , you &apos;re very hip .
that &apos;s the theme song to &quot; the antiques roadshow . &quot;
he &apos;s right .
that &apos;s embarrassing .
great house , huh ?
and you can &apos;t beat the location ,
mainly &apos; cause i live right there .
we love the house .
great !
but i could never live across the street
from that pornographic statue .
i never noticed it .
yeah .
you could see it from inside when you look out the window .
oh , i didn &apos;t -- uh , are you talking about that one ?
it &apos;s quite large .
i &apos;ll take your word for it .
i &apos;ve had this listing for two months ,
and i can &apos;t move it because of the statue across the street .
it &apos;s called &quot; marble with wood , &quot;
and let &apos;s just say it &apos;s made entirely of marble .
we &apos;ve got to do something about this . it &apos;s obscene .
that &apos;s what they said about &quot; the catcher in the rye &quot;
when it first came out .
you &apos;re not helping .
why don &apos;t we just knock on the door
and talk to him ?
i tried .
yeah , the guy &apos;s a jerk .
i told him how much it bothered us .
it only seemed to please him .
i &apos;m not gonna lie --
it makes me feel bad about my body .
i don &apos;t feel comfortable letting my kids play out here .
our kids .
paul , please .
art is subjective . some people would love this .
hey what are you guys talking about ?
here they come .
the statue .
ohh , god , we hate that thing .
you do ?
yeah .
i didn &apos;t make my money to move to a neighborhood
where they put something like that on the street .
porn belongs on a big screen in the bedroom
or your phone in the bathroom .
kids , go play .
well ... what are you gonna do ?
guess we &apos;ll just get used to ignoring it .
i just wish he was more concerned
with being a better neighbor .
yeah .
amen to that .
yeah .
hey , we were just about to grab dinner .
you guys want to join us ?
what &apos;s that ?
i said , you guys want to go to dinner ?
how &apos;s that ?
if you guys don &apos;t want to , that &apos;s fine .
no , no , no , no , no . no , no , no , no , no . oh , no , no , no .
no , no , no .
no .
a @-@ are you saying no ?
you know what ?
sure , why not ?
of course .
all right ! great !
great !
we &apos;ll meet you out front . 15 . i &apos;ll drive .
oh , claire , just so our outfits don &apos;t clash ,
i &apos;ll be wearing lizard .
ah , shoot . well , i &apos;ll find something .
okay .
oh , don &apos;t you just love it -- the crash of the pins ,
the smell of the rental @-@ shoe spray ?
yeah , it does kind of get the blood going .
oh , one small detail --
this is an all @-@ gay bowling league ,
so i told everyone you &apos;re all gay .
what ?
you have to be gay to play .
let &apos;s go meet the guys .
forget it . not doing it .
jay , we need you .
no one &apos;s gonna believe i &apos;m gay .
oh , why , because you &apos;re not flouncy enough ?
jay , that &apos;s offensive .
there &apos;s all kinds of gays .
you &apos;ve got your broadway gays , your gym gays ,
your twinks , your bears , your otters ,
your &quot; hey , girl &quot; gays .
you &apos;ve got your pups , your cubs , your chubs .
and most prominently , you &apos;ve got your
average @-@ joes @-@ who @-@ you @-@ would never @-@ know @-@ are @-@ gay gays .
what the hell is an otter ?
lane 20 . white pants .
look , you don &apos;t have to do anything differently .
just ... be yourself . you &apos;re gay enough .
hello , cameron .
i thought i smelled failure and cheap hair spray .
oh , hello , martin . you &apos;re looking unwell .
could you do that thing you did
last year where you lose
and then you try and throw a chair
but not realize it &apos;s bolted down
and wrench your back
and then curse at me
while i wave a trophy in your big , red face , could you ?
oh , boy , look at you . you &apos;re all worked up .
it must have been a tough day
assistant @-@ managing that jo @-@ ann fabrics .
it &apos;s a michael &apos;s , and you know it , you son of a bitch !
fine . i &apos;ll do it . i don &apos;t like that guy .
but what happens if somebody i know comes in here
and thinks i &apos;m living a secret life ?
jay , trust me ,
if someone you know comes in here tonight ,
they &apos;re living a secret life .
you make a point .
okay , let &apos;s meet the guys . guys !
hey ! i am in the best mood .
my uber driver looked just like adam driver .
you guys ready to party ?
yeah , let &apos;s go !
where ?
out . let &apos;s do this .
it &apos;s 8 : 30 . the doors don &apos;t even open for another hour .
well , then , what are you doing here ?
pregame !
mojitos and cosmos --
the drinks of your peoples .
all right , let &apos;s get crazy .
i &apos;ll uncover the cheese .
so , we &apos;ll meet my friends outside the club at like 10 : 30 .
10 : 30 ?
yeah , the band doesn &apos;t go on until midnight .
midnight ?
okay , if you guys can &apos;t hear me now ,
we &apos;re gonna have some real problems at the club .
no problem .
no , we &apos;re good . we &apos;re good .
i hope i can be as cool as you guys in 30 years .
does she think we &apos;re 50 ?
no , no , she &apos;s just really bad at math .
two strikes in a row !
familiarize yourself with the exit
because somebody &apos;s on fire !
okay , jay , you &apos;re up .
all right , jay . let &apos;s get that first strike .
keep your eye on the prize .
imagine taking that bad boy home tonight .
jerry ...
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m just off my game tonight .
you got this .
who &apos;s your new guy ?
he &apos;s my husband &apos;s uncle .
oh , you look confused .
a husband is somebody who loves you
that you don &apos;t have to pay .
damn it !
that guy is not gay .
i could have you disqualified , you know .
of course he &apos;s gay .
i &apos;m never wrong .
my gaydar is highly sensitive .
for instance , i have to move it away from you right now
before it explodes .
i &apos;m keeping an eye on uncle jay .
okay , jay -- - don &apos;t worry . i &apos;ll pick up the spare .
no , no , no , we got bigger problems .
um ... martin &apos;s onto us .
you need to flounce it up a little bit .
but you said that was offensive , remember ?
the otters and weasels and stuff .
okay , you know what &apos;s more offensive ?
martin winning .
so , we need to get you lighter in those rental loafers .
what gave me away ?
i &apos;m not handsome enough . is that it ?
perfect . insecure and superficial --
it &apos;s a great start .
should we order a bottle of wine ?
yes .
oh , no need .
ronnie brought this big daddy from home .
yeah . guy .
hey . guy .
oh , ronnie , i &apos;m sure he has a real name .
yeah , it &apos;s guy .
mr. and mrs. lafontaine , so nice to see you again .
hey , guy .
hi , i &apos;m guy . pleasure .
hi , guy .
hi .
oh . very nice .
2002 harlan .
what are we celebrating tonight ?
well , uh , we &apos;re finally having dinner
with our next @-@ door neighbors .
well , you must be very good neighbors .
that &apos;s so nice .
thank you .
oh , don &apos;t mention it .
it &apos;s nice to have you guys here .
so , how are the kids ?
uh , good . it &apos;s a little intense right now .
uh , alex is freaking out about
where she &apos;s gonna go to college ,
and we &apos;re freaking out it &apos;s gonna be on the east coast .
oh , yeah . well , we get that .
r.j. &apos; s going to new york soon .
i think i &apos;m gonna cry harder than the day
i found out i was pregnant with him .
yeah , what &apos;s r.j. got going on in new york ?
well , we wanted him to go to college for business ,
but he wants to do his music .
so , long story short ,
he &apos;s going to juilliard .
juilliard ?
for piano .
well , mostly for his composing .
kid can &apos;t hit the toilet ,
but he wakes up with symphonies in his head .
right .
there we are . would you like to taste ?
oh , yeah .
that &apos;s a $ 500 bottle of wine .
that &apos;s like 100 bottles of your wine .
yeah , let &apos; er rip .
oh , i &apos;m ready !
damn it !
oh , come on , cam . admit it .
uncle jay -- not gay .
oh , my god . you could not be more wrong .
look , okay .
if he &apos;s acting a little weird ,
it &apos;s just because ...
he totally likes you .
no , he doesn &apos;t ! what did he say ?
okay , look , he -- he -- he didn &apos;t want me to say anything
because he &apos;s shy .
that &apos;s why he &apos;s being so awkward .
cam , you &apos;re up .
i &apos;m up .
i got to go .
hey , there .
this is for you .
oh . thanks .
and this ...
is for a little zing .
we do love zing .
be right back .
be right here .
why is that guy being so nice to me ?
well , there &apos;s been a @-@ a new little twist in the evening .
and now there &apos;s one in my beer . what &apos;s up ?
i told him you have a crush on him .
why would you do that ?
i had no choice .
well , you tricked me into coming here , you made me gay ,
now i have a boyfriend .
all these lies just to win a trophy ?
yes .
i respect that .
oh , those are my friends .
they &apos;re out front dropping off our wristbands .
what comes before part &quot; b &quot; ?
par @-@ tay !
oh , my god . i &apos;ve been holding that in for an hour .
gloria , i &apos;m not gonna make it .
you have to .
we talked so big to cam and jay that if we don &apos;t go out ,
they &apos;re never gonna let us live it down .
okay .
or we could just blow it off , man .
no , gloria , come on , come on .
get up , get up . come on , come on , come on .
staying up all night -- it &apos;s in your blood .
you come from the land of coffee and cocaine !
you too ! nobody likes to dance more than the gays .
pretend you &apos;re on a float .
dancing . that &apos;s it . that &apos;s a good idea .
okay , dancing . dancing .
i &apos;m gonna turn on some music here .
this is good .
oh , my &quot; raise the roof &quot; elbow &apos;s a little sore .
oh , yeah , that must mean rain .
oh , my god . your kids give you that look , too ?
yeah , i swear i can &apos;t remember
what their actual faces look like .
this is fun . isn &apos;t this fun ?
to think it just took us all hating the same statue
to bring us together .
what a world it could be if people would just hate more .
yeah , what are we gonna do about that thing , huh ?
it &apos;s not right that a guy like you can &apos;t even get his job done .
well , we could start a petition .
yeah , or we could talk to our city councilman .
or ... how about this ?
we take a rope , we tie it around the statue ,
attach it to the back of my truck ,
and drag it to the nearest dump .
love that .
i &apos;m serious .
uh , we can &apos;t do that .
no .
why not ? we got tons of rope .
availability of rope isn &apos;t really the issue here .
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s destruction of property .
it &apos;s against the law .
so ?
ronnie , we live in a civilized society .
we &apos;re not those kinds of people , you know ?
says the lady who , uh ,
paired my cabernet with fish .
so , is there anything else i can get you ?
nope . i think , uh , we &apos;ve had enough .
and that means two things .
i &apos;m not done .
all right ! like the music !
you guys really know h--
i &apos;m not getting good rotation tonight .
certainly made my head spin .
oh , what can i say to that ?
hey , can i ask you something ?
what do you think of that picture ?
doesn &apos;t look a thing like you .
exactly what i &apos;ve been saying .
not the man sitting next to me .
the rugged good looks ...
... broad shoulders ...
piercing blue eyes .
hell , you &apos;re -- you &apos;re somewhere between
kevin costner and channing tatum .
who wouldn &apos;t want to be between them , huh ?
okay , jay , you &apos;re up .
thank you , martin . i needed that .
anytime .
there &apos;s the real jay !
you know it !
where is the baby ? !
i &apos;m up . i &apos;m up .
hey , when did you get back ?
like an hour ago .
oh , really ?
i must have grabbed a little disco nap .
i don &apos;t know what that means .
you sure you guys are up for this ?
yeah , definitely , definitely .
of course .
why don &apos;t we go dancing another time , like daytime ?
oh , you know , well , i &apos;m pretty full of cheese , so --
no , no .
if we don &apos;t go out now ,
this is not about cam and jay making us old ,
it means we are old .
this is about pride .
we need to prove that we can still go out and have fun .
are you with me , mitch ?
yes !
yes , i am !
okay .
all right , let &apos;s go .
okay .
can we get some coffee on the way ?
no coffee !
no coffee !
oh , yes , baby !
our team had really found its groove .
we quickly eliminated
the pinafores and alley of the dolls ,
putting us in the finals against my archrival .
in the tradition of red sox / yankees , ali / frazier ,
it all came down to
the britney spares vs. martin and his merry men .
the tension was building ...
could somebody please take these fries
before i eat them all ?
... and emotions were running high .
um , so , jay , i just , um
i just wanted to say that whatever happens ,
it was , uh , r @-@ really nice meeting you .
well , you too , martin .
uh , d @-@ do -- wondering , i don &apos;t know ,
w @-@ w @-@ would you like to have dinner sometime
or maybe hang out or ,
or something like that ?
oh , geez . you know what ,
i &apos;m , i &apos;m , i &apos;m really , really flattered
okay , i get it .
no , no , it &apos;s not .
no , no , i get it , totally .
no , it &apos;s okay . i understand .
thank you very much ! good luck !
and just like that , martin fell apart .
by the last frame , it was all up to jay .
okay , jay , we only need six pins !
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s gonna be six , guys .
we won ! we won !
this is the fifth @-@ happiest moment of my life !
adopting lily , marrying mitchell ,
high @-@ school football championship ,
and sitting behind sarah jessica parker
at &quot; wicked . &quot;
all right !
okay !
let &apos;s do this ! let &apos;s do this ! let &apos;s do this !
i can &apos;t do this .
me either .
ah ! we &apos;re almost 50 !
the ride home , while less than a mile long ,
was interminable .
whatever bridges had been built
were burned ,
like my fish was ,
which is why red wine was a --
hey , honey , you don &apos;t have to defend yourself .
when it comes to wine , this woman doesn &apos;t see color .
she &apos;ll drink whatever &apos;s put in front of her .
oh , great .
they put lights on it .
stop the car .
we have to tear that thing down . they &apos;re right .
it &apos;s the only way .
what ?
now you &apos;re talking !
there &apos;s the girl
that i occasionally have sex dreams about .
yeah , that &apos;s true . he told me .
no , no , no . this is crazy .
yes .
don &apos;t do this .
how many months do you want to spend
trying to fight through some bureaucratic red tape
to get that thing taken down
only to be told there &apos;s nothing we can do ?
oh , no .
stay in the car .
stay in the car !
what do we do ?
here , take that . put it around .
through the loop .
yeah , i do this .
tie it down .
it &apos;s too short . i got to back the truck up .
no ! no !
phil , what are you doing ? come on . open the door .
i can &apos;t allow this to happen !
come on , man .
i &apos;m a respected member of the community !
i &apos;m on bus benches !
you &apos;re such a boy scout !
open the door . open the door .
i want that thing gone as much as anyone ,
but not like this .
i &apos;m gonna take this truck .
i &apos;m gonna go get some fro @-@ yo .
i suggest you use the walk home to calm down .
once you have , you &apos;re gonna thank me .
phil . oh , my god ! you &apos;re going back ...
thank you !
i thought i was in drive !
phil !
phil !
we were awesome tonight , guys .
do you think we &apos;re good enough to take on the lesbians ?
oh , god , no .
one more round on me .
good match , martin .
you too , jay . congratulations .
thanks . i hope i didn &apos;t throw off your game at all .
no . that &apos;s all me . i do that .
i get ahead of myself .
create expectations , build them up .
don &apos;t worry about me . i &apos;m going to see a life coach .
it is going to change everything .
well , listen , i wasn &apos;t feeling great about myself tonight ,
and you helped get me out of that funk .
and it wouldn &apos;t be right
for me to let you leave feeling bad .
you &apos;re a great guy ,
and the reason i turned you down is because ...
it &apos;s much harder to say out loud than i thought .
i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m not gay .
you &apos;re straight ?
who &apos;s what ? what &apos;s happening ?
whoa , it feels good to finally tell someone .
for four hours ,
i &apos;ve been living in fear that i &apos;d be found out .
do you have any idea what that feels like ?
right .
jay , thank you for admitting that .
you are a real class act .
disqualified !
you lose !
give me that ! that &apos;s mine ! oh , my god !
oh , my god , champions !
we &apos;re champions again !
let me out !
oh , my god !
guess what , jay .
you &apos;re my new archrival .
i feel terrible .
you &apos;re too good , boy scout .
yeah .
that &apos;s why you need people like us around .
admit it -- you &apos;re happy it &apos;s gone .
i &apos;m happy it &apos;s gone ,
but it &apos;s weird we &apos;re out here
instead of inside with the lights off .
it &apos;s called hiding in plain sight .
we just sit here and act like we got nothing to hide ,
and they won &apos;t suspect a thing .
folks , i need to ask you a couple of questions .
someone said they heard a big truck run over that statue .
what ? well , we wouldn &apos;t know anything about that
because we were at dinner .
mind if i take a look at your truck ?
hey , buddy .
oh , don &apos;t call a cop &quot; buddy . &quot; they hate that .
no , that &apos;s his name .
i sold him a condo .
phil ?
yeah , buddy .
the four of us were at dinner . i can vouch for it .
if you &apos;re looking to solve a crime ,
this one here had red wine with fish .
oh , i did . i did .
sorry to bother you . you folks have a good night .
you too .
no more boy scout .
looks like you &apos;re sleeping with an outlaw tonight .
yes .
uh , we &apos;re in .
no , no , i was talking to claire .
yeah .
are you saying you &apos;re not attracted to us ?
no , no , no ...
no , no , no ...
no .
no .
it &apos;s unbelievable .
mom and dad are sitting outside
with the neighbors they used to hate
yukking it up like they &apos;re all best friends .
and why ?
because there &apos;s wine ?
no . because of art .
that statue that was so offensive
provoked a conversation .
that &apos;s what art does . it brings people together .
even if it &apos;s gross ?
one person &apos;s gross is another person &apos;s beautiful .
wow . that &apos;s really powerful .
do you think this could bring people together ?
it &apos;s a self @-@ portrait of ... my junk .
never speak to me again .
hypocrite .
