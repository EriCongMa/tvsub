My father was an innocent man,
destroyed by powerful people.
The Graysons are behind this, and they're gonna pay.
I've dedicated my life to avenging his death...
Eventually, someone's gonna find you out.
And I won't stop until they've all paid the price.
Where am I?
Grayson Manor, of course.
You're Takeda's daughter.
Niko.
I'm not supposed to be here.
I should be away with aiden, with his ring on my finger,
not Daniel's.
You and Aiden are engaged?
And Emily obviously doesn't know about us-- our past.
Because of the surgeries required to save your life,
you'll never be able to conceive.
Emily lied about the pregnancy.
She made it up to scare you away.
Are you ending this with me?
There has been much speculation as to who shot me,
it was Lydia Davis.
I know it was you, Daniel.
Emily cemented Lydia's fate and saved yours.
I'm not going anywhere.
When I was a child,
my father woke me every morning with the same phrase --
"Life is a great sunrise."
The words shaped the way I saw the dawn.
But after my father was taken from me,
the morning sun burned like fire.
That's when I learned what hatred was
and that it would greet me each day to come.
You pulled your stitches out in your sleep.
Thank you for coming so quickly.
My father would have wanted me to help his favorite disciple.
Not punch you in the stomach
and storm out of here like I did last week.
I'm glad you did.
You helped me recommit to Takeda's teachings.
Well, let's get you stitched up.
I've decided on a quicker fix.
You called me here to cauterize you?
That's insane. I'm not doing it.
Do you know what orphans dream of
when they stop wishing for their parents to return?
We think about filling the emptiness
with families of our own.
Thanks to Daniel, that hope is gone for me.
This doesn't mean you're ready for a sparring match.
When you resume physical activity, you have to do it slowly.
Then I'll start with mind games.
First things first, you need something to bite down on.
Just do it.
Welcome to reckoning day.
No need to furrow that handsome brow.
I'm not here with the police...
though I should be.
Nolan, I can't begin to tell you how sorry I am.
We are a million miles past sorry.
You assaulted me.
You stole from me...
All to win favor with your mother?
There's something twisted about you. You're sick.
Stop.
Why are you here?
I know that you're desperate
for answers about how you came to be,
and...
I know that Victoria hasn't been forthcoming.
So...this is a police report
from 1974.
I dug it up last year when Vicky G. enlisted me
to help her find her long-lost son.
You see, according to this, someone else was searching
for little Patrick Osbourne, as well.
Derek.
Victoria.
I was told you wouldn't be here.
Oh, this is completely my fault.
Dr. Robinson only agreed on a house call
because I felt too weak to get to his office.
I thought that you'd be at your morning tennis game, Victoria.
My doubles partner mysteriously cancelled.
Well, this is awkward.
If you'll excuse me, ladies.
Thank you.
How long have you been seeing my therapist?
Just today.
Charlotte mentioned how
helpful he was in bringing you two back together
after she learned that David Clarke was her father.
If you're trying to build a bridge between us, Emily,
Here's a tip -- stay on your side of the river.
Dr. Robinson warned me you may feel this way...
And that Daniel might be resistant, too.
Resistant?
He hasn't laid eyes on you in days.
His quarters are so far away,
he may as well be sleeping in the stables.
Well, I guess we'll just have to give it time, then.
Are you sure you don't mind always sleeping at my place?
Oh, I like your apartment.
It's cozy.
I grew up in drafty chateaus so big,
I never knew where my parents or brothers were.
I love opening my eyes in the morning
and seeing you and Carl so close.
That's what makes it a home.
Ooh, it's there!
Hey, Bobby.
Good to see you, man. Could you do me a favor?
Would you keep those front-row-center this week?
It's the lady's pride and joy.
Sure.
The staff did such a good job.
Yeah. Wait.
I did not write this.
The by-line says you did.
No, no, I-I mean, yes, I did, but not with those words.
No, I must get to the office.
Someone's head is going to roll.
Are you here to escort me out?
How apt that the woman who left me without an ally
in this family conflict should show me the door.
You're moving out?
I'm sorry. I didn't know you were leaving.
Well, truth be told, I'm elated, like a prisoner paroled.
But rather than shuffling off
with a plastic bag of personal effects,
I'm taking my first editions.
Conrad, I -- I'd like to explain myself.
Yeah? What's to explain?
When you held that news conference
and you threw Lydia under the bus,
you destroyed my last chance at happiness.
I had to protect my own chance at happiness.
I won't lose Daniel.
"Tamerlane" by Edgar Allan Poe.
This is one of the very few copies left in existence.
In the poem, a warlord reaches the conclusion
that love is more fulfilling than power.
What a fool.
When your paramour betrays you, as Daniel will,
come find me at the Southfork.
I'll be running my wartime operations from there.
That's for you to keep.
Mrs. Grayson,
Ms. LeMarchal's calling for Daniel.
She said it's urgent. Should I wake him?
That's his wife's job.
Daniel?
Margaux called. There's a crisis at work.
We can't avoid each other forever.
Let's talk.
All right, come in.
What do you want to chat about? The weather?
How I slept last night?
'cause I didn't. Not much, anyway.
That about does it for me.
What's new with you?
第三季 第十三集
I'd love to go to Aunt Gina's jewelry party.
Just, the thing is, work has me slammed right now.
Ma, please don't say I'm blowing you off.
I... Uh, look, I've got to hop.
A customer's giving me the stink-eye.
Yeah.
It's one thing to deliver a wake-up call
to my husband and his mistress,
but I have too much self-respect to watch you lounge by our pool.
You have to go now.
Well, Daniel asked me to stay, and I'm sticking by him.
I won't let you destroy my marriage.
Don't you think this is sad, Emily?
For you, I mean. He doesn't love you.
Oh, that's a cheap shot, Sara.
I'm trying to handle this with dignity.
After pulling the most pathetic stunt ever?
Faking a pregnancy to lock a guy down.
Daniel's pushing his boundaries with me.
And after the pain I caused, it's understandable.
Right now your earthiness is what's catching his eye,
but you don't fit in here.
I'm actually proud of that.
Until people find out about you and start judging him.
Because I'm trash? Is that what you're saying?
Excuse me.
A glass od cristal, please.
Right away.
Aiden, I am fine with you living here
And I've even grown to enjoy
our killer-and-the-tech-wiz "Odd couple" dynamic.
But you have a lot of nerve
inviting a perfect stranger to crash here, too.
Slow down, Felix. I don't know what you're talking about.
Then go check with your new roomie, roomie.
I thought you were staying at your father's loft.
You mean the place where he was murdered?
I can't sleep there. It gives me nightmares.
So, when Emily called this morning to ask me for help
with her wound care, I decided to pack up my things.
And make yourself at home here.
Yeah, it'll be nice.
So, you -- you attended to Emily.
What's the news?
Physically, she's gonna be fine.
I think it was finding out she
can't have children that hit her the hardest.
I can't imagine she opened up to you.
She...doesn't really do that to strangers.
She has to me.
We've spoken about all sorts of things.
Does she know about us?
As in how we're back together, you mean?
No.
If I told her that, I'd just be bragging.
I thought I could avenge my father's death by myself,
but I can't.
I need you to help me.
What's the problem?
He was your mentor.
Which is why I'm in.
"Aware of the bad blood between Thorne and Lydia Davis,
Conrad Grayson took the pre-meditated step
of buying his mistress a handgun
and welcoming her aboard the honeymoon yacht."
That sentence did not exist when I signed off on the final copy.
The last person to handle the
book was my assistant editor, Jessica Roche.
She's responsible.
Yeah, well, get her ass in here.
She's gone -- suddenly picked up and moved to Europe.
She sabotaged us, Daniel, and believe me, when I find her --
Margaux Lemarchal?
Oui?
Merci.
Oh, great.
Conrad is suing Voulez for libel.
My father planted the false content.
He paid Jessica off. I'm sure of it.
Why?
We had a fight.
The bastard said he was coming after me.
I said, "Bring it."
That was a reckless move.
Yeah, well, I didn't think I had anything else left to lose.
It seems he thought of one thing.
Darling, we're late for our meeting with Libby Wells.
Yeah, I called her studio and canceled that appointment.
Jimmy Brennan?
Heard of him?
I hadn't heard of him, but
if I'm to believe what's in this police report,
he may also go by "Dear old dad."
It's true.
My father showed up at the orphanage that you dumped me at.
Instead of being allowed to see his son,
he was cited for trespassing.
I got shipped off to a family in Ohio the very next day.
Whoever gave you this information wanted to hurt you.
Who was it?
Was it Nolan?
You know what? I'll ask the questions here.
When did you meet him?
When I was 15.
Was he your boyfriend?
No.
We were together once.
There are 32 Jimmy Brennans in the tri-state area.
I'm hoping one of them's mine. Take a look.
He was not a father, not the kind you deserved.
Yeah, well, you know what?
That's my decision to make.
Daniel? Why am I learning from Bitsy Hopkins,
who heard from her maid, that you have a friend staying over,
One who sips champagne at my swimming pool?
I really don't care what
some old bat from across the road is saying,
not when my own father is trying to sue me into oblivion.
Yes, I'm aware, and I'm here if you need me.
You're poking a dangerous bear, though.
I can handle dad.
I'm talking about Emily.
She's waging psychological warfare on this family.
You are foolishly taunting her with your infidelity.
Well, after the hell that bitch has put me through,
she deserves to have her nose rubbed in it.
It's a fine strategy if it's just the two of you,
but you brought Sara onto this battlefield.
She is a soft target. Emily will crush her.
I know because I dismantled Conrad's first wife
in a similar manner.
Well, I appreciate the concern,
but I'll dismantle mine my way,
limb by limb.
Nothing like a little retail therapy. Sorry for the mess.
Yeah, you'll be cleaning it up yourself.
I fired the staff.
What?
"What?"
Grayson dirty laundry is getting aired through the maid chain.
I questioned the servants, and when no one stepped forward,
I had to axe the whole team.
That wasn't fair, Daniel.
For 25 years, not a single employee
violated their confidentiality agreements.
Now suddenly they're gossiping because Sara spent the night?
God.
The fact that you still think I'm an idiot makes me laugh.
Do you want to know what I really think, Daniel?
I ask myself over and over again, "Why did he cheat?"
And let's be honest -- we both know you strayed
long before you learned the truth about me
on our wedding night.
What made you lose interest, huh?
I'm not doing all of this because I'm a bored housewife.
I'm fighting to win you back.
Really?
I've been ruminating on your powers of deception,
and I realized that everything you say
is hidden behind fake concern or a phony smile.
In fact, if anything else suspicious happens around here,
I'll know you're behind it.
And just like today, other people will pay the price
until you finally realize
that there's no place for you in my life and you leave.
Is that him?
Dad!
Hey, kiddo! How you doing?
Okay, kiddo, go! Go! Here! Boom!
Why have you never asked me about my adoptive family?
The only way I could survive
letting you go was to imagine you happy.
Well... here's the reality.
Ed and Barbara Osbourne were my parents.
I-I don't really, uh, remember much about her.
She died when I was 4.
And after that, Dad married Anne.
Anne didn't give a damn about me, so...
neither did he.
To feel that kind of rejection from your --
your father makes you feel like, um...
It made me feel like there was something wrong with me...
No...
Something, uh...
Something bad, unlovable.
I still do.
Oh, no! He's coming in! He's coming in!
Which way -- ohh! I got him! He's gonna slam him! Boom!
It could have been different.
Hi. It's so good to see you.
Mm. You too.
Yeah, I would have stopped by sooner,
but I had to make sure that patty cakes
and his moms were off-site.
Damn, girl. What is with all the zeroes?
Daniel tried to put me in my place
by firing the house staff today.
The least I can do is cover their salaries...and then some.
Your husband's... kind of a hole.
He even has Sara sleeping over.
He's trying to chase me away.
You know, with the leverage the guy's gunplay gave you,
it's not like he can just ask for a divorce.
It's a risk that he just might take.
He loves Sara, so Sara's got to go.
Mm, another day, another breakup.
You're not even gonna ask about Aiden?
How is he?
He's one of the reasons I wanted to stop by.
I meant what I said. We can't be together.
No, no, no.
I'm not here on his behalf.
I want to cut him loose, too.
I only let him stay with me because you asked me to.
But now with Niko in the picture
making big ben chime every hour on the hour, ugh,
They need to find their own love shack.
They're together?
You didn't know? I didn't realize...
Where are you going?
I just -- I can't sit still any longer.
Emily?
Emily?
What are you doing here?
Emily?
What's going on?
I-I was looking for Nolan.
Are you okay?
You... you seem unsteady.
Oh, just, uh, since my head injury...
I'm getting a little dizzy sometimes. It's -- it's nothing.
I need to get home. I-I had no intention of seeing you.
No. You wait. I've got things to say to you.
I can't have this conversation right now.
Look, I understand you got hurt,
but you don't just get to abandon me
without hearing my side of things.
Look, I can't forget about the future we planned together.
Okay? And neither can you.
W-why else would you be coming here, giving me mixed signals?
You're conflicted.
No, I'm not.
If you walk out of here, this is over.
You're gonna have to live with your choice.
Like your choice to screw Niko?
We know it was you who planted the misinformation.
First libel, now slander?
I would watch my words if I wre you, Ms. Lemarchal.
Cut the crap, dad.
Only you would malign yourself just to screw me over.
Okay. How do we fix this?
I'm willing to drop my suit just as soon as you fire my son.
What are you trying to pull?
Just something the French call a coup d'etat.
My sources inform me that there's a clause in Daniel's contract
that allows you to buy back his shares in Voulez.
I would, in turn, purchase them from you
at twice the market value.
If you think we're gonna cave to your threats, you have --
I'll do it.
Margaux.
This is not about negotiating.
He's out to destroy you, and I won't allow my success
or my family's reputation to be killed in the crossfire.
You want to get in bed with the devil?
Clearly, I can't stop you.
I assume Satan will want the corner office.
I have no desire to punch a clock --
Just my boy.
What is this?
Where's Aiden?
I don't know.
We were supposed to have dinner, but he's gone.
No call, no text, just gone.
Doesn't it bother you when people are inconsiderate?
Yeah... Niko, it does.
And, uh...
Look, while I was hoping to chew this fat with your boo present,
Uh, I think it's time I just ripped off the band-aid.
O...M-G.
I'm studying my father's autopsy for the first time.
The authorities were unclear as to the murder weapon,
but those stab wounds tell a tale.
They were made by a katana. His katana.
How can you be so sure?
Because it traveled everywhere with him
and now it's not in his loft.
I think the killer stole it.
And I will hunt him to the ends of the earth.
In the meantime, I'm practicing separating skin from flesh.
Was there something you wanted to say to me?
It can wait.
Okay.
You're home!
I have a surprise.
I stopped by your full gourmet kitchen for a snack earlier.
Nobody was there, so I started puttering around,
and next thing you know...
everything's from scratch.
Caprese salad, pasta primavera,
and pistachio gelato for dessert.
And after dinner, our Italian theme continues
with "Roman Holiday" In the screening room.
Why, you're very sweet.
What's wrong?
My father had me ousted from "Voulez."
Danny...
What's going on lately, huh?
Just seems like you can't catch a break.
Are you kidding me?
I just caught the biggest break of my life...
you.
I don't know. I-I-I just can't be in this house right now.
Everything reminds me of him.
Okay, well, let's go out. Anywhere you want.
Okay...
Italy.
Seriously?
Uh, what about keeping up appearances for your marriage?
What about Emily?
I don't care about either of those things.
Tomorrow, you and I are gonna hop on the jet
and take a Roman Holiday of our own.
Come on.
You shouldn't have followed me here.
Well, after I saw you steal
away from the house, you left me no choice.
Those guys over there work for Jimmy.
I, uh, called his construction company,
pretending to be a roofer looking for a job.
It wasn't hard to find his favorite watering hole.
All right, before you make contact with that man,
there are things I have to tell you about him.
I don't really want to hear it.
There have been too many times since we've reconnected
that you've punted this conversation.
I want to meet my father on my terms.
Not through your impressions of him.
So, please...
just go.
You...
Relax, honey.
It's okay. Shh, shh! It's okay.
Take me out of here, please.
Come on. Let's go, come on.
Thank you.
Did you know, deep down, I hate tea?
My mother was a fan of instant coffee.
She was a vulgar woman who murdered her lover
when I was 15 and forced me to take the blame.
When I released back to her custody...
she stood by as another one of her boyfriends...
molested me.
After she threw me out,
I made myself drink Fortnum's Earl Grey
as a way to forget about my past and seem more upper-crust.
What did Jimmy Brennan do to you?
Well, as I told you, he lived down the hall.
I was a child pretending to be an adult,
desperate to re-create myself.
Jimmy was like a big brother, a few years older than I,
and he always watched over me.
So, when a fuse blew one day in my apartment,
I didn't think twice about following him down to the basement.
To help him fix it.
He kisses me...
and I say, "No, we're just friends,"
and I try to pull away.
And he has this look on his face like a monster.
He punches me,
and I raise my arms to cover my face
to mask my shame and my confusion.
Because I had worked so hard.
I did everything to change myself, and I...
I knew he could still see the victim.
And he pushes my face into the cold concrete,
and he whispers, "Relax, honey."
Over and over and over.
A-all I could do...
Was focus on the pilot light underneath the water heater...
and wait for him to be done.
The day you were delivered, they put you in my arms
and you heard my voice and you looked straight in my eyes.
And I felt this calm.
There was nothing of Jimmy in you.
You were from me and no one else.
And we were happy.
Then why did you, um...
He started stalking me, so we, uh...
we ran from apartment to apartment
until there was nowhere else to go.
And then this miracle happened --
A scholarship to Paris.
Painful as it was,
I knew it was the only way I could protect us both.
When I took you to sister Rebecca,
I told her that Jimmy might come for you,
And she vowed to keep you away from him at any cost.
The truth...
I didn't know what to do with it.
Withholding it from you caused such anguish.
But how could revealing it not cause you more?
Patrick.
Do not let these circumstances
define you the way I let them define me.
How's the magazine?
You sort out how those lies got in there?
Still sorting.
Yeah?
I would rather not bore you with the details.
I'm just glad to be home.
Well, I'm glad that you feel this is home.
What is all this?
I've been house hunting.
Where will you move to?
Ideally, um, someplace close...
with a yard, um...
with you.
You've said that you love waking up where we are.
Well...
I love you.
And I know it seems sudden, but if I've learned anything,
it's that life is too short and happiness is fleeting.
I think that we make a great team,
and a home -- a real home --
should be someplace that we start together.
Say something. I'm swinging for the fences here.
I love you, too.
I love you, too.
This was taken by a bank security camera
across from your father's loft the night of his murder.
Who is he?
Gregor Hoffman,
the one who planted the bomb at Grayson Global last year.
Your father was onto him. I think Hoffman realized it.
I reached out to my contacts,
and one came back with a cellphone ping,
proving that Hoffman is alive and well
and living in Moscow.
So, I got you a flight.
It leaves tonight.
You're not coming with me.
My father trained you to be what you are today.
You loved him. You --
But you love Emily more.
Come on.
I'll take you to Nolan's. You can pack.
Whatever we need, we'll buy when we get there,
including the luggage to bring it all home.
Hey, how about one of those Louis Vuitton trunks?
Oh, it's italy. I'm going Gucci, baby.
Sara Marie.
Ma. We, um...
H-how are you here?
Well, when you refused to engage with me, Sara,
I didn't know what else to do.
So, this is where you've been
when you tell me you're at work?
You're lying to your family,
sneaking around with this...prince?
If I could just explain...
You don't talk to me.
Now, I don't know how you manipulated
my smart, self-sufficient girl,
but I won't forget the hell you put her through,
and I did not nurse you back to health
to see you become this person,
this home-wrecker.
No, it's not like that.
Danny and I love each other.
So you can do whatever you want?
She almost died, and here you are, moving in on her man.
That girl is snowing you. She's a menace.
She ruined Danny's life.
No, our problems didn't start
until you came back into his world.
Come on, Sara, we're leaving.
Ma.
Look, I love you, but...
you got to mind your own business.
You are no longer a daughter of mine.
Good luck, sweetheart.
I'm sorry for your pain.
Come here. Come here.
I'm sorry I made us miss our flight.
Oh, that's the beauty of flying private.
Our departure time is whenever we want.
I, uh -- I was thinking,
I wanted to reach out to your mom.
I want to explain our side of things.
Yeah, it won't work.
I'll -- I'll get a divorce. I-I'll phone my attorney tomorrow --
No, Emily is never letting you go, Danny.
She destroyed my relationship with my mother,
and that was just her first swing at me.
Then we'll swing back.
My mom was right.
This isn't me.
I got swept up in something, and -- and -- and I want out.
Goodbye, Daniel.
Mission accomplished?
Niko bought it. She's in there gathering her things.
I have to admit, I'm surprised you were willing
to doctor that information for me.
You mean...
surprised that I would help cover your guilt?
Aiden, life's complicated,
as are things between you and Emily.
I am worried about her, Ross.
The Emily that left me is not the one that I know.
Something is off.
Really?
Because when I saw her, she seemed back to normal.
What do you think is wrong?
I'm not certain.
Maybe you can get to the bottom of it when I'm out of your hair
and Niko is chasing Hoffman's dead-end trail.
It's not a dead end. She'll find Hoffman.
That wasn't the plan.
The man killed Declan Porter.
You said you wanted your femme Nikota to taste vengeance.
Well, this way she will...
and justice will be served.
Straight up.
Many believe there is no such thing as too much love.
That its warmth is a comfort from which we never tire.
But when love turns to obsession, it consumes itself.
The flame that nourished
becomes angry, merciless,
an all-consuming blaze...
leaving us confused by the chill in the air
and the hate left behind.
Sara left me.
To break me?
Is this what you wanted?
I told you I was gonna fight for us.
Are you insane? There will never be an us!
Thanks to you, I'm dead inside.
So am I! We did this to each other, Daniel.
You took from me, so I took from you.
Don't you see?
We belong together.
Sterilizing you was my gift to the universe.
Oh, good. You're awake.
You were marvelous last night, Mrs. Grayson.
Until our next rendezvous.
How was the flight from California?
Smooth.
It's funny.
When they told me who I was meeting,
I was expecting to see the former governor's wife.
Hardly. I'm the first Mrs. Grayson.
Well, you know what they say -- nothing beats the original.
I think so, too.
