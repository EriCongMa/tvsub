Two years ago, I tried to tell you I loved you.
You loved me?
I have feelings for you. I don't wanna ruin our friendship.
I think we should just throw down and see what happens.
I mean, we just fell asleep.
After an entire bottle of wine...
And one kiss.
A kiss is not nothing.
People kiss because they have feelings for each other.
Blair, you and I are magnetic.
Our pull is as undeniable as ever.
I'll be waiting at the top of the empire state building.
At 7:01, I'm closing my heart to you forever.
Hi, I'm meeting a young man here,
probably in a bowtie, possibly carrying peonies.
I did the most romantic thing I could think of,
and it didn't work.
I'm sorry.
Chuck? What are you doing?
Is there someone in there?
no, nobody.
Dorota went into labor.
Sorry I was so late.
I can't deny that our path has been complicated,
but in the end, love makes everything simple.
I wanted it to be special.
What happened?
You need to ask her.
I am so sorry for the pain I've caused you.
Blair, will you be--uhh!
Humphrey!
You--tell her.
You didn't.
Blair.
You did.
You, go and never come back.
I think I need to be alone for a while.
If you're out, you're out.
Nate, I love you.
I'm someone who's not gonna stop looking for love,
which is why I'm going to Paris, and why you're coming with me.
I really think I need this.
Me, too.
It's gonna be okay, B.
Georgina, what are you--what are you doing back in town?
Congratulations, daddy.
He looks just like you.
I'm not gonna spend the entire summer
waiting for her to figure things out.
When he took off for Prague,
Chuck left me his little black book.
There's no need to get rough.
Hey! Not that.
Just let me keep the box!
Nothing beats a summer abroad,
but when traveling far from home, it's always nice
to bring along an old friend from the neighborhood.
Cobblestones and cafe de flore.
Serena's locked down the left bank
and become a Muse to us all.
Meanwhile, Blair rules the right bank,
storming the shops and consuming the classics
and sampling sugary snacks
like a modern Marie Antoinette.
But we hear Serena's stories sizzle
while blair's are more fizzle.
She shopped at Saint Laurent
and dined at Drouant,
but the only beau B. had this summer
is on her headband.
Your cute waiter gave me his number.
Blair, what are you doing?
We said we wouldn't check "Gossip girl" all summer.
Summer's almost over.
So what does it say about Chuck?
I couldn't be less interested.
No new posts.
He's been M.I.A. since he left town in spring.
And what does it say about us?
"Ooh la la! Paris is burning,
and Serena and Blair lit the match."
Of course, your flame is hotter than mine.
Everyone knows that the only guy
who's been in my pants all summer
is the tailor at Pierre Balmain.
And whose fault is that?
Hey, just as many guys have flirted with you.
I just happen to have a thing for french waiters.
And bartenders and museum docents,
anyone on a vespa or bicycle,
or wearing Zadig & Voltaire.
B., what's wrong? I thought you were having fun.
I am. The best. But...
All summer, I've been sitting in front of my favorite Manet
and reading Colette in the park,
hoping that I'll lock eyes with somebody who's doing
the same thing as me and feeling the same things as I am.
That's really romantic.
But, alas, not effective.
For all my efforts, I'm heading back home
with a Chuck-sized cloud over my head.
And I don't... Even need to find a great love.
I just wanna go on one nice date.
Well, then this calls for some more sancerre.
Come on. I know a great wine bar down the street,
and it happens to have a very cute bartender.
Jenny looked so good.
You could even tell what color her eyes are.
Well, sending her to Hudson was a good decision.
You know what wasn't?
Visiting my mother. We had to.
Yeah. Couldn't we have just said the Arno flooded
And stayed with Eric and Elliot
in Italy a little longer?
Message one.
Lillian, it's Eleanor.
Just a reminder
that you offered your lovely abode
for the fashion's night out planning luncheon tomorrow.
Cyrus, you're going to cut off Ana's circulation.
Seriously, dear.
Aren't you glad that's not us?
Imagine starting all over again
with diapers and bottles and spit up.
Next message.
Lily, it's Bruce Caplan.
Call me when you get in. It's important.
The Bass business manager. I wonder what he wants.
If it's about Chuck, I'd rather not know.
End of messages.
No message from Dan?
Last time we went this long without talking
was when he had his tonsils out.
And I am sick of texting.
Since he hasn't called us,
it's time to call in the big guns.
Please, wake me up with a few--few stories
from Chuck's little black book.
I, uh, I think the last time we spoke,
you--you'd made it through all the T's.
Yeah, well, let's just say "V" is for "Vivid"
and leave it at that.
I mean, it's pretty awesome.
I'm having tons of sex,
I never have to eat dinner alone,
and best of all, I don't have to talk about anything.
So the key to a good relationship
is no relationship at all? Mm.
It does get pretty exhausting, though.
Hey, don't--don't get me started on exhausted.
Hey, what you're really tired of is
keeping everything a big secret.
No, no, no. my--my--my dad and Lily are home today so I'm--
I'm--I'll tell them, I promise.
Tell them what?
What decision? It's not mine to make.
Nate broke up with me,
and Dan was trying to patch things up with Vanessa.
Well, I'm not asking you to make predictions about them.
It's about you, what's in your heart.
At night when you're falling asleep,
what are you wishing for?
When you asked me on this trip,
you promised me retail therapy.
I fall asleep
thinking about guys named Louboutin and Laurent.
Home doesn't exist until we're there.
Speaking of home...
Mademoiselle, Pour Vous.
Oh. Merci, delfine.
Judging from its weight and size,
I'd say it's your course catalogue from Brown.
I'll let you know when I open it.
You know, as much as I'm gonna miss you when you're in Providence,
having separate lives ensures no competition,
which means no high school pettiness.
Promise we won't go back to our old ways.
Like you said, that was high school.
So you have no idea where he is?
Well, Charles didn't exactly leave town on good terms,
and even when he does,
he finds it best not to tell us where he's going,
for our own sakes.
Yeah, well, I need your help in finding him this time, and fast.
He hasn't paid the mortgage on the Empire since May.
That's when he left. Yeah.
Well, the bank says one more missed payment,
he'll be in default.
So these are the last records of his movements.
It's plane tickets, credit card charges, A.T.M. Withdrawals.
why don't you look 'em over and maybe make a few calls?
Of course. Thank you, Bruce.
Thank you. We'll find him.
Okay.
Hey, mom.
Hi, sweetheart. I wanna hear all about your day--
The food, the shopping,
and the boys on Vespas.
well, that pretty much sums it up.
But first, um,
I wanted to know
if you or Blair have heard from Charles.
No, and I don't expect to.
It's actually decent of him, leaving her alone.
Yeah, poor Blair. Is she still hurting?
Yeah, but she's putting up a good front.
And I wouldn't worry about Chuck.
Any normal summer,
he's drunk on some island where polygamy's legal.
Given everything that happened, it makes sense he's gone rogue.
Why you so interested?
Oh, no, uh, if you don't know anything, I can find out myself.
You just keep having a good time. How are you?
I'm not sure.
I got into Columbia.
Serena, that's wonderful.
Yeah.
Yeah, but I'm not sure Blair will think so.
Your dad called me. He said he couldn't reach you.
I told him he should try Serena
because I assumed you'd be with her,
because what other reason could there possibly be
that you haven't called or e-mailed me all summer,
or making me have this conversation in the doorway.
No, Vanessa, I'm so sorry about that, but there is a reason.
Is it...
Because you've become a hoarder? You know what?
A-after what you did, I shouldn't even care.
But... are you okay?
I'm...
I guess you're more than okay.
Is that the reason you've been avoiding everyone?
Because you're seeing someone new?
No, I'm not. I'm--I'm not.
Dan, is there someone here?
You know what? This was a mistake. I'm gonna go.
That's probably a good idea. Thanks.
You're dating Georgina?
No. No, we're not dating.
That's true. We barely ever leave the house.
No, but it's not--it's not for the reason you think.
Then what other possible reason could there be
in the god-I-don't-believe-in's universe for Georgina Sparks
to be leaving lingerie around your house?
Meet Milo.
He's our son.
No.
No. Shut up!
No, you--you really-- you have to shut up...
right now.
Shut up!
Oh, my god.
Okay, you didn't. You did?
Are you serious?
Shut up!
God! Oh, my-- tiff, do you mind?
Oh. Sorry.
Okay, you didn't.
You did not.
You did?!
Wouldn't wanna interrupt your girlfriend's private conversation.
It seemed pretty important.
She's not my girlfriend.
I was being polite.
No, she's not that, either.
She's just a... Friend of a friend.
What kind of a friend is that?
The kind that leaves me his little black book
for the summer.
And I doubt your friend would bring his friend
to a place like Norma's.
Well, it's the least I can do,
to take her to a nice restaurant.
I mean, that Perkins hostess
slept with Tiger Woods for over a year,
and all he got her was a chicken wrap.
Oh. That's respectable.
Thank you.
So why isn't it your companion?
Well, I tried respectable.
You were hurt.
No.
Well, I guess there's a...
first time for everything.
Easy come, easy go.
I can't tell if your approach is enlightened or chauvinistic.
Take her seat and find out.
That's a good line.
You almost pulled it off.
But... I have an appointment I can't be late for.
Well, Nate Archibald.
Could I at least get your number?
What, it's not in your friend's little black book?
An American who loves Manet?
It's too good to be true.
How did you know I was American?
And don't tell me
it's because my accent isn't as good as I think.
Your accent is divine.
But your watch is set to eastern standard time.
New York?
Born and bred.
I've never been,
but I'd love to hear all about it.
Over dinner tonight?
It would be my pleasure.
Great.
Give me your information, and I-I'll pick you up at 9:00.
Louis?
I'll see you tonight.
Wait, wait. A car?
Embassy? Grimaldi? Don't tell me you're--
I'm Louis. Just Louis.
Hey, where are you?
I wanted to talk to you this morning, but you'd already left.
I think I just met a real live prince.
A Grimaldi--as in the royal family of Monaco.
As in Grace "American princess" Kelly.
Stop whatever you're doing. We need to shop.
Only for you, B.
Spotted--B. And S.,
Chic and cheerful
up on Boulevard Haussmann.
They dallied at department stores
and stayed a while at Tally Weijl.
down on Rue Saint-Honor?
They courted couture at Palais Royal
and found the perfect outfits
to bash the competition.
Then they headed to the Golden Triangle,
where Montaigne meets George Cinq,
And luxury goods are the opiate of choice.
But the Grimaldis aren't a very large family.
He's probably a first cousin at least,
But just to be sure...
B., what are you doing?
Cinderella did not google prince charming.
A mystery man shows up at your painting,
Just like you wanted.
You cannot make this about some social agenda.
You're right, and so what
If my fairy godmother is my credit card?
This is fate.
Wait, before I lose you to another shoe coma,
There's something I wanna talk to you about.
That package I got yesterday...
S., I want to hear all about
How brown offers a major in raw foods, but...
It's Louis! we're going to baccarat!
I have just the thing to wear.
And you have to pick up a little something, too.
His friend Jean Michel showed up unexpectedly in town,
And our date is now a double.
I don't think that's a good idea.
This is your princess moment.
Please? If you don't come, he's gonna cancel.
And those brown boots would look amazing on you.
Brown! What did you want to tell me about college?
It can wait. Let's go buy boots.
Look, I-I'm--I'm working on it.
I just need a little more time.
You have one day.
Not again, Milo.
Can't you ever sleep for more than five minutes?
sorry, I think I have the wrong number.
Oh. Mr. Humphrey.
Um, this is Georgina Sparks.
It's so great to hear from you.
It is?
Georgina, I-I don't understand.
W-why are you answering my phone?
Where's dan?
listen, I'm sorry that we couldn't talk more yesterday.
Milo's been real colicky.
The fact that you even know that word is--
Oh, oh, oh, oh, you'd be shocked at what I know
about breast-feeding and baby poop and episiotomies.
Wow, do not mention her geor-gina.
It's a lot to take in.
Believe me.
But please--please don't tell my dad or--or Lily, all right?
I gotta be the one to tell them myself.
Why haven't you?
I don't know. maybe 'cause I'm totally freaking out?
Do you know how difficult it is to keep a baby alive?
You can't drop it. You can't leave it alone.
It has to eat, like, every three hours.
If I don't know what hit me here,
How am I supposed to tell my dad?
I have to ask, as will Rufus--
Are you sure Milo's yours?
Of course he is.
I mean, I'm pre-- yeah, I'm pretty sure.
You didn't have a paternity test?
Vanessa, you weren't there when she came to me.
Her parents threw her out. she was--she was scared.
It was actually my idea for her to move in.
I've been waiting for the crazy shoe to drop...
But it never did.
I mean, she's-- she's been great with Milo.
Dan, we're talking about georgina sparks.
Her hair lies.
You can't trust one thing that comes out of her mouth,
Let alone anywhere else.
I know. I asked her for a paternity test,
But you can't get one in the last trimester.
I didn't sign the birth certificate.
I told her I wouldn't until we got the test.
What are you waiting for?
You have outdone yourself once again. Truly fit for a king.
Well, not a king yet, but maybe someday.
You clean up pretty good, too.
Merci.
Oh. He's driving himself.
That's... progressive.
Independent.
Louis, bonsoir.
Blair, you look amazing.
And this must be serena.
Uh, nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you. Serena, um, may I introduce
Jean Michel Grimaldi
of Monaco?
Blair, enchant?
I don't understand. I thought you were a grimaldi.
The chauffeur was taking you to the embassy.
Oh, you misunderstood.
I am a driver for Jean Michel's family.
I took them to the embassy, where they're staying.
Oh. I-I see.
So that means your date is a prince,
And mine...
is charming, handsome, and loves Manet.
We make our own fairy tales.
Let's go.
I've never sat up here before.
Oh, wait.
Spotted--B. Riding shotgun.
Great view.
Let's see if our royal wannabe
has the grace to make it through the night.
Eleanor, you're early.
Well, just to set up, dear,
and to accessorize you properly.
You know "Bass" Is not her middle name.
Well...I was afraid nobody would know who she was.
Not a lot of Humphreys in the society pages.
You don't have to stick around if you don't want.
Oh, you think I'd skip out
on a roomful of champagne and models?
Are you forgetting I used to be a rock star?
Oh, what is this?
Why do you have Chuck's travel itinerary,
bank statements, and credit card bills?
Because I think he might be in trouble.
After what he did? Good.
Well, apparently, he went to Prague in May,
checked into his usual suite at the mandarin,
and never checked out.
His credit card charges are very un-Charles-like-
second-class train tickets, prepaid cell phones.
What if something happened to him?
Look, for better or worse, he's a part of this family.
Yours, not ours.
And after the choices he's made,
Chuck deserves whatever's coming to him.
Did I hear you say Chuck?
Blair will not even mention his name.
She never even told me why they broke up.
Uh, you wanna tell her or should I?
Aren't you so excited that our girls
will be at Columbia together this year?
What?!
I didn't even know that Serena had applied.
Here you go, Danielle.
And if the C.F.D.A. Needs more volunteers,
let me know. I'm around.
Of course.
Juliet, have you met Willy Wong from nyc & company?
Oh. Nice to meet you, Juliet.
Nice to meet you. Oh. Here you go.
Thank you.
And drinks are to your left.
Thank you.
Thank you.
and the guards at the casino were charging on us.
$1,000 chips were flying everywhere.
Everywhere.
Then a guard grabbed me by my belt
and dragged me out to the street.
All because he was wearing blue jeans.
It was crazy.
Oh! Oh, my gosh.
Sure,
but enforcing strict standards of dress is essential
for maintaining the decorum of an event.
Besides, it's tradition.
Men's formalwear hasn't changed
hardly in over a hundred years.
And it's not just a symbol of class.
Owning a tuxedo shows the world
that a man has enough means
to marry and provide a future for his family.
Blair, are you okay?
It's my mother calling from New York.
I should take this. I'm fine.
So who wants a bite of her dessert?
What is it, mother? I can't talk long. I'm on a date.
Blair, you sound irritated. Are you okay?
Why does everyone keep asking me that?
So what if Serena always gets the prince
and I get the pauper?
Being jealous of her is totally Constance,
and I've moved on.
Well, that's wonderfully mature, dear.
And the best part is that nothing has to change
now that she's going to be at Columbia.
What? Serena's going to Columbia?
Let me know if there's anything else I can do for you,
Karlie.
Thanks. Is Eleanor here?
Uh... Oh, right there.
Thanks.
Nate?
Juliet.
What are you doing here?
I'm a volunteer. I worked the event last year.
What are you doing here?
Nathaniel, thank you for getting here so fast.
I was hoping you could look at Charles' papers
and see if there was anything that you might find that I haven't.
But steer clear of Rufus, okay?
Okay.
Blair, come meet Lou Doillon.
Bonjour.
Bonjour. Hey, maybe you could ask Lou Doillon
to be your new best friend, because I'm done.
Have fun on my date.
Excuse me.
Can I get your name?
No.
Oh, god. This is not good.
Georgina. To what do we owe the pleasure?
You have 15 seconds to top me off or you're fired.
Ahem, Georgina, maybe you should come with me.
That's sweet, Archibald, but I don't like vanilla.
Does Dan know you're here?
Why would Dan know?
Hello, Dan.
Hey, uh, I'm--I'm at home, and you guys aren't here.
What, you go on a walk without me?
Yes, we did, all the way across the bridge.
Georgina, don't do this.
What? W-why?
I just thought it was time everyone met.
Would you like to talk to your dad?
Rufus, Dan's on the phone. He'd like to speak with you.
Dad, I am so sorry. I-I wanted to tell you.
I just--I-I didn't know how.
Tell me what?
Whose baby is that?
Here you go, grandpa.
Oh, god.
This is Milo Humphrey, your grandson.
Daniel?
Dan?
Spotted--Georgina Sparks, a stroller,
and Dan's dad with a scowl.
I think he's on his way.
Looks like lonely boy has a baby boy.
Meredith, I am so sorry about this.
Please apologize to everyone at "Vogue."
Um, unfortunately, something has come up.
But Eleanor has said she's more than happy
to continue the party at her place.
And we've got a little one there as well.
Absolutely adorable thing. You'll love her.
What's going on?
Why does Georgina Sparks have a baby?
We are still trying to figure that out. I'll keep you posted.
Okay. Bye.
Meredith. Hello, Nathaniel.
I wanna take you to...
Who could've seen this coming?
Have you met Georgina?
Good point. Where is she?
She...
Please tell me
this is just another one of her ridiculous schemes.
Dad...
Why don't you, um, talk in Serena's room?
Sorry all the drama ruined your luncheon today.
That's okay.
Well, in case you're wondering,
my life's been pretty drama-free these days.
Uh, hello?
Pardon the interruption, Mr. Archibald,
but there's an emergency in your suite.
What kind of an emergency?
Hey, there you are. What's wrong?
You can have the left bank, okay? But I want the right.
Every cleavage-baring blouson and cute bartender is yours.
But I want a dress from Dior
and I want a date with a royal.
And I wanna go to school.
And take classes and have friends
without living in your shadow for the next three years.
You heard about Columbia.
Do you wanna hold him?
Look, I-I wasn't expecting this introduction either.
You didn't have to spring it on us like this.
I know I have a flair for the dramatic.
But I didn't know what else to do.
Dan wasn't telling you, and you had to know.
At least now everybody's talking.
Oh, please. You're enjoying this.
I know you think I'm crazy, that I'm a schemer and a liar
and pathologically selfish, and--and that's true.
Or it was,
till Milo was born.
I understand if you hate me.
Please don't hate my son.
He deserves to have a good family,
and no one has more love than you or Rufus.
Lily, Dan hasn't done a paternity test.
It might not be his kid.
Is this true, Georgina?
You're right, rufus.
Dan did not do the paternity test,
But I did.
I wanted you to love Milo because you wanted to,
not because you had to.
But... If it's come to this, then so be it.
This--this says I'm the father.
Well, no offense if I don't take your word for it.
Blair, I'm sorry. I know you wanna do your own thing.
But Columbia isn't yours.
My dad went to med school there.
He encouraged me to apply. And I wanna go to college,
but I don't wanna leave the city.
I wanna be with my family and my friends.
I-I wanna be with you.
Oh, lucky me!
I love how it never has occurred to you
that someone might not wanna see you every single day.
"Someone," Sure.
Probably lots of people, but not my best friend.
I need a chance to succeed on my own.
I wanna be myself, where I belong.
Last year, first with N.Y.U.
And then Chuck--
it was the worst year of my life.
Yeah, well, my last year was pretty awful, too.
I-I-I fell for a married man, got in a major car accident.
I fought with my mother so much I was basically homeless.
And then there was my dad...
Fine. Stay in the city.
Just go to a different school, okay?
Blair, I wanna make you happy. I really do.
But college is too big of a deal.
I got in and I'm gonna go.
Look, we can talk about all of this tomorrow.
But right now,
There are two very handsome frenchmen waiting to take us
To the front of the line at Le Baron.
Louis really likes you.
Yes, he does.
And so does Jean Michel, for that matter.
I'll go back, by myself,
And I'll come up with some story as to why you didn't return--
That you tripped and fell in the fountain.
Seriously? No one's gonna believe that.
Wanna bet?
Well, thank you, doctor.
I-I appreciate you confirming these results yourself.
Okay. Bye.
It doesn't mean anything.
We're doing our own test.
Dad, the dates line up. I-I thought we were being careful,
But it's not like I didn't sleep with her.
Why didn't you come to me when she first showed up?
Do you remember how you reacted two years ago
When Serena and I had that scare?
Not to mention I didn't know
That I could handle the truth myself.
Everything you said then is--is still true.
I had to see this through.
I-I couldn't let Georgina go off,
raise this child without me, nev--never knowing him.
I may get angry or protective,
But I'll always be there for you.
That's how it works when you're a father.
You may not understand that now,
but trust me, one day you will.
I-I think I already do.
Georgina, do you have the birth certificate with you?
It's in my bag.
Thank you.
Thanks, dad.
What are you doing?
You wanna play "Rock band 3" With us?
There's a keyboard. We can make it a 5-piece.
Oh, I hope it's okay. We used your credit card.
Your friend who left you his book--what was his name?
Chuck bass.
And what would chuck bass do in a situation like this?
He wouldn't be in this situation.
And you shouldn't be either.
When you're ready to talk about
What really got you into this place...
Give me a call.
You're a natural.
thanks.
Have you talked to Serena lately?
Well, the better question is, have you?
I know something happened between you two before she left.
But I'm guessing you haven't had much time to figure things out.
There's nothing to figure at this point.
I-I can't imagine she'd be interested
In being a stepmother.
Yeah, I've--I've sealed my fate, I think.
But,but--but when you do speak to her, if you could
do me a favor and just not say anything about this?
I wanna be the one to break this news.
Yeah, of course.
is she having a good time?
Well, it's Paris.
There's great shopping, great food,
weekends with Harold and Roman at the chateau.
I think she's having the time of her life.
I know, Jean Michel. We all love serena,
But she's just clumsy like that.
It must be all those long limbs.
Serena.
what happened?
Blair happened. I'll see you in New York.
Jean Michel, would you care to walk me home?
Wait, no, Jean Michel! Don't!
That's okay. I'm glad to have you all to myself.
Actually... I'm tired.
If Jean Michel is gone, shouldn't we go, too?
He told me I was being overcautious,
But I see that I was not.
About what?
I am the royal. Jean Michel is my driver.
When you asked me so many questions about my name,
My car, the embassy,
I grew concerned that you might not like me for me.
What? No. Who--who would ever--
It happens sometimes.
But when I found you gazing at my favorite painting,
I thought that someone who loved what I loved could--
Could one day love me, too.
We hear baccarat just updated its menu.
I thought it was fate, but I guess not.
No, no, no. It is fate. It's just...
Have a good evening, blair.
The gateau du jour is now humble pie.
Bon appetit, blair.
hello?
Georgina? It's Vanessa.
dan and the baby are sleeping right now.
Yeah, I just tried his cell.
Do you have a message?
I don't really have time to chat right now.
I just wanted to tell him that I am here
if he needs to talk.
I'm his friend and always will be.
Oh, that's sweet. He's gonna need a friend.
I'll let him know.
And just in case you don't,
I said the same thing on his voicemail.
You know me too well, friend.
Good-bye, Vanessa.
Is it any consolation
that I totally imploded and ruined my date?
It's not.
I called the airport. The car is already on the way.
I can catch the red-eye.
Can you hand me that copy of "Be"?
I wanna read it on the plane.
Please don't go.
I don't care about dating a prince.
I don't care about dating anyone. I just care about you.
I really need my friend right now.
I've been acting like I'm okay, but I'm not.
They say it's a broken heart, but...
I hurt in my whole body.
I mean, what if I stay like this forever?
What if I never get over Chuck?
You will. You'll see.
I just don't know what I'd do without you.
I'm scared if you come to Columbia
that I'll do something to destroy us.
Well, you pushed me in a fountain tonight,
and here we are, talking about it like mature young women.
So I'd say that's a good sign.
And what if Columbia's a disaster,
and we lose each other for good?
And what if it's amazing,
and we become closer than we've ever been?
Come on.
Live dangerously.
You in?
Yeah, I'm in.
Now all you have to do is tell Dan and Nate
that you'll be in the city next year.
What are you doing?
Spreading the word myself. And you can't change your mind
because gossip girl hates being wrong.
This just in from Miss B. Herself:
Serena van der Woodsen is heading to Columbia.
S. And B. Together again?
We think we've died and gone to heaven.
Or at least the upper west side...
Nate.
Hey, I know it's late.
But you know what? You were right.
I-I was hurt...
By someone. A lot, actually.
I'm sorry.
I didn't think I was gonna have to see her again for a while,
and I just found out she's coming back to New York city
and... I'm just not ready.
You know, I was trying to send a message to her
that I'm having the time of my life, and it just isn't true.
I can't keep it up. I'm exhausted.
I owe the hotel thousands of dollars in damages.
Do you wanna meet up to grab a cup of coffee?
Sometimes it's easier to talk to a stranger.
That sounds--sounds great. Yeah.
French Roast, 20 minutes?
Absolutely.
It's from France.
Hello?
Yes, this is she.
Oh, my god, is it Serena? Is she okay?
Okay, I will.
What? What is it?
A body washed up in Paris--shot.
The identification they found says it's...
Charles Bass.
Stop!
My little sister!
Stop! Get off of me!
Did you sleep with her?!
Jenny Humphrey was just--
Don't say her name!
W-where am I?
You're safe.
Who are you?
What's your name?
H-henry.
Henry Prince.
You had the dream again.
I hoped it wouldn't follow us from Prague.
I guess I'll have to give it more time.
You have as long as you need.
My uncle said the apartment is ours,
and he's got you a job, too.
Thank you.
Welcome to Paris, Henry.
Let's go home.
Napoleon once said
that secrets travel fast in Paris.
But Gossip girl travels faster.
