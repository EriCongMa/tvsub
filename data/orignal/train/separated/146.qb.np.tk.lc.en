第一季 第十二集
you said a moment ago you didn &apos;t care who it was .
he raised chuck .
would you do me the honor of being my wife ?
i think you like dan a little too much .
just thought i should let you know someone &apos;s watching .
chuck , you are not answering my calls .
please , for the love of god , do not tell anybody about us .
on the upper east side , it &apos;s easy to think
that the world is exactly as it appears
refined , elegant , imposing .
but sometimes , all it takes is a little key
to open the door to the wild side .
nate. why have you been avoiding me ?
avoiding you ? what ?
ever since i got back from monaco ,
you &apos;ve been--you &apos;re not returning my calls or my texts .
i &apos;ve barely seen you. really ? i don &apos;t recall .
oh ? well , do you recall that night after the debutante ball
yes , i do .
blair ?
what are you doing ? this .
good catching up .
enough with the blackmail. aren &apos;t you bored already ?
i can &apos;t avoid nate forever .
excuse me .
i didn &apos;t say forever .
just until the sight of the two of you together
doesn &apos;t turn my stomach. and when will that be ?
only time will tell , i &apos;m afraid .
so unless you want dear nathaniel to know how
you lost your virginity to me in the back of a moving vehicle ,
i encourage patience and restraint .
isn &apos;t there someone else you can torture ?
probably ,
but i choose you .
why don &apos;t i turn that , uh , one @-@ piece into a no @-@ piece ?
find a floatie to talk to , chuck .
you know , if my dad and your mom
come back from south africa tomorrow engaged ,
we &apos;ll be brother and sister. and you know what they say
the family that plays together stays together .
ah , incest-- the universal taboo .
one of the , um , only ones you haven &apos;t violated. well , i &apos;m game if you are .
dan humphrey , age 17,
enjoying an exotic meal of cheerios
on an exciting saturday night in .
come on. be interesting .
you don &apos;t want me to move back to vermont , do you ?
no , but if your whole future
depends getting this grant for your documentary ,
i @-@ i really , really think you should find a new subject .
absolutely not .
the outsider goes inside
a likable everyman &apos;s pursuit of his dream girl
begins his descent into the bowels of hell .
this is mythic stuff .
okay , not big on the soundtrack .
whatever movie he &apos;s scoring sounds depressing. yeah ,
i think it &apos;s a biopic .
try listening to that for three weeks straight .
but before christmas , my dad hadn &apos;t finished a song in years ,
so i really don &apos;t have the heart to ask him to stop .
well , i do .
hey , serena .
yes ! finally some action .
hey. what are you up to ... besides missing me ?
oh , uh , just wondering if you &apos;re missing me .
well , of course i am ,
at this party that would be a lot more fun if you were here .
party ? i thought it was a quiet night with blair ,
your last night at her place before your mom comes home ? yeah , we were ,
and then kati and is showed up , and we all went out ,
and we ran into some people and then ended up here .
where--where &apos;s here ? 719 e . 82nd street .
wait a second. that &apos;s , um ... that &apos;s school , is it not ?
bring your bathing suit !
you &apos;re swimming ?
no , you hung up .
so what will it be , dan-- cheerios and chaucer
or an illegal party at your prep school pool with
your high society girlfriend and her nasty cohorts ? dad ?
vanessa and i are--are going out. all right .
well , uh , if you wanted to get
the perfect shot of me feeling like an outsider ,
then i &apos;m ready for my close @-@ up .
dan ! oh !
hehe vanessa. hey .
come on , guys .
hey , get off me .
help !
call the ambulance ! call an ambulance .
someone call 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 .
hi. hi. we--we need-- we need an ambulance .
yeah , a @-@ a kid-- he--he hit his head ,
and--and he fell in the pool .
it--it &apos;s 719 , uh , east 82nd street .
thanks to the cell phone that somebody left behind ,
we &apos;ve got plenty of evidence of who was at the party .
lucky for you ,
andrew collins is going to be fine .
unlucky for you , we need to hold someone responsible .
ms. queller ?
hello .
i &apos;m ms . queller ,
the new headmistress at constance .
it &apos;s unfortunate that we meet under these circumstances .
but i look forward to getting to know
each and every one of you .
i &apos;ve already talked to your parents ...
at least , those i could reach ,
and look forward to reading your personal essays--
10,000 words
describing how you came to be on school property after hours ,
using alcohol and drugs ,
where a fellow student almost died .
in other words , what the hell is wrong with you ?
i &apos;ll also be conducting one @-@ on @-@ one interviews
until i discover
who broke into the pool and initiated the party .
that person will be expelled .
if that person is not identified ,
then you &apos;ll all face expulsion .
so we all know how this works .
look , no one talks , no one gets into trouble .
who did break in , anyway ? i guess we don &apos;t have to worry
about nate cracking under pressure .
so are we all agreed ?
agreed .
look , blair , i @-@ i know you have your sights set on yale ,
but this--this skull and bones stuff is a bit much ,
don &apos;t you think ?
maybe , but it works ...
every time .
you know , when someone says &quot; every time , &quot;
it sounds like--like--like more than a few times .
erything &apos;s gonna be fine .
were you just in the same assembly as me ?
do you really think she &apos;s gonna expel
two @-@ thirds of the junior class ?
look , i got you into this .
i &apos;m gonna get you out of it , okay ? trust me .
there &apos;s a weak link in every chain ,
and it &apos;s just a matter of time before this one snaps .
i &apos;m innocent .
well ... except for a crime of passion .
i did something stupid with someone .
and even worse than doing that stupid thing ,
i did the same stupid thing with someone else
and pretended i had never done that stupid thing before .
you look confused. should i walk you through it ?
let &apos;s stay on point .
i reviewed your record. it &apos;s pristine .
if constance has a shining star , it &apos;s blair waldorf .
i would never have expected this from you .
i know . i &apos;m the perfect one .
ms. waldorf , who broke into the pool ?
like you said , my unfortunate participation in said party
was entirely out of character .
i don &apos;t know anything about it .
you &apos;re taking that paper seriously .
this isn &apos;t a paper. it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s a heartfelt letter to blair. a heartfelt letter ?
who spayed you , man ? blair doesn &apos;t even want you .
she &apos;s been crystal about that since we got back .
didn &apos;t seem that way en she kissed me at the pool .
she kissed you ? well , i kissed her , but ...
yep .
what was she like ? into it ?
or was she more like-- of course she was into it , man. what do you think ?
yeah , i know , but , uh ... you know blair ...
yes , i do .
i think she wants me to suffer a little more .
you know , even the playing field ?
it &apos;s worth it , believe me .
hey , dad. listen , uh , i @-@ i got your 1,001 messages .
i just haven &apos;t had a chance to get back to ya .
yeah , that &apos;s not gonna work .
i guess you heard from the new headmistress. look ,
i know how upset you were by everything ,
and apparently , some of the kids who were at the party
didn &apos;t even tell their parents. look , you don &apos;t have to say anything else .
i @-@ i regret even leaving the house saturday .
but if you know something that could keep you out of trouble ,
then you need to cooperate . i don &apos;t. i--really ,
dad , i don &apos;t .
dan , don &apos;t think for a second
these other kids aren &apos;t gonna be looking out for themselves .
you need to do the same. all right ?
i hope i &apos;m not interrupting anything .
i just got a message that our kids are in
some kind of trouble at school .
and you came all the way to brooklyn to talk about it ?
no , no , not about that .
um , bart and i just landed at the airport
back from our trip , and he proposed ,
and i &apos;m going to say yes .
i wanted you to hear it from me first ,
not from my daughter or your son .
right , the people who actually talk to me. oh ,
if you &apos;re referring to the message
you left me on christmas day ,
i didn &apos;t get it until we were already on the plane .
it was very endearing , though .
but not enough to turn the g5 around ?
you miss me. that &apos;s great . i miss you , too .
what ? you kissed me at eleanor &apos;s party ,
and then you say
you can &apos;t see me anymore because your wife came home ,
and then you call and say you should &apos;ve never let me go ,
and then you &apos;re back with alison again .
i didn &apos;t plan any of that. that is just it with you , rufus .
you don &apos;t even plan anything .
well , i &apos;m sure that your current plan
will be full of private jets and 5 @-@ star hotels .
take care , rufus .
do you really have to show this to me now ?
trust me when i say you &apos;re gonna wanna see this
before you enter blair waldorf &apos;s evil lair .
it &apos;s a homework group ,
vanessa .
we &apos;re just gonna be writing papers , you know ?
here .
i wasn &apos;t sure what it was
till i got it home and saw it on the computer , but-- okay , that &apos;s chuck .
what are you holding here ? it &apos;s a key .
spotted , lonely boy learning
that when the punishment fits the crime ,
there &apos;s no reason you can &apos;t serve your sentence in style .
yay ! you &apos;re here . i thought we were gonna work on our papers .
we are. one night at bilboquet ,
kati and is made out with a guy in cornell &apos;s ethics program .
they &apos;re getting tips now .
i thought i told you you couldn &apos;t film me .
come here .
you are so naive. michael moore over there
is obviously just using this film to get close to dan. no ,
she needs that grant money .
so did you bring your legal pad ?
you wait here . i &apos;ll find us a quiet place to work .
okay .
i can &apos;t believe you brought that here .
it &apos;s evidence. give it to me .
chuck .
you need to tell the truth .
whatever happened to &quot; don &apos;t speak until spoken to &quot; ?
i just saw you with that key . i know you had it at the party .
poor little humphrey dumpty .
look , let me clarify something for you .
regardless of who you &apos;re currently sleeping with ,
you and i come from different worlds .
in my world , if i &apos;m suspended or expelled ,
a wing is donated in the bass name .
that sounds like quite a world .
well , it &apos;s not perfect , i &apos;ll admit .
but one thing it does offer in spades is security .
my family can take care of me .
what do the humphreys have to offer ?
used metrocards ?
your dad &apos;s cassingle ?
and in case you were wondering , you narc ,
i only took the key from the party to hide it
so we didn &apos;t all get blamed ... including you .
blair . nate. what are you doing here ?
i , uh , wanted to talk to you . i brought you this .
it &apos;s a love letter .
a hostess can &apos;t hide in her room. it &apos;s unladylike .
hey. hey , where are you going ?
i made us a study area in the other room. you know what ?
i &apos;m just gonna write my paper at home .
i @-@ i think--i think chuck is right. wait . chuck ? no , don &apos;t listen to him .
no , the guy has a point , actually .
maybe the reason none of you guys take this seriously
is because for you it &apos;s not. no , it is. just trust me , okay ?
vanessa , please , some space . i &apos;m sorry. sorry .
look , i &apos;m all for loyalty
and i &apos;m all for sticking together ,
but we are not in the same boat here .
i &apos;m on a partial scholarship. my parents have no way
of buying my way back into this school , or any other .
and i know this isn &apos;t going to be a popular opinion
with--with your band of brothers ,
but if the person who brought that key refuses to step up ,
then anybody who knows anything has the right to say something .
do--do you know who it is ?
you do , don &apos;t you , and you &apos;re not gonna say anything ?
dan , please. you don &apos;t understand .
you &apos;re right. i @-@ i mean , i don &apos;t understand .
hey , let go of me , bass. drop your archibald habit first .
you know i already have. really ?
a kiss does sort of send the wrong signal .
let &apos;s not waste time denying .
you know what ? i &apos;m tired of this. go ahead and tell him. really ?
you want me to tell him how you slept with me
and then faked your virginity for him ? i &apos;ll just tell him you &apos;re lying .
and who do you think he &apos;ll believe ?
you , who bangs anything in his field of vision ,
or me , his pure and honest girlfriend of many years ?
now he &apos;ll believe me .
why ?
i have proof .
good eye , docu @-@ girl . i &apos;ll take the tape now .
you knew she was watching ?
this is my house. that tape belongs to me .
actually , this is my footage , and thanks to both of you ,
i think i got a new angle on my subject. hey , vanessa ,
let &apos;s get out of here .
if you think i &apos;m gonna ... let go of me .
let you walk out of here with that tape , you &apos;re crazy .
last time i checked , i still owe you a black eye .
so unless this is you coming to claim it , stay away from her .
now that sex and lies have been caught on videotape ,
v. &apos; s documentary just became
the most anticipated new release of the year .
rufus. what are you doing here ? i &apos;m not leaving a message for you
from the courtyard this time. well , i can see that .
but five minutes ago ,
my kids would &apos;ve-- why did you really come to see me yesterday ?
i told you. out of respect for-- respect or regret ?
you wanted me to give you a reason
not to spend the rest of your life with bart bass . rufus ...
i &apos;m still in love with you .
so what exactly are you offering , rufus ?
some retrospective of the way we were over a decade ago ?
look , we &apos;re not 20 and on the road .
thank god we &apos;re not , because your mother
made this decision for you back then , remember ? yes .
look ...
i don &apos;t know exactly
what it would even mean for us to be together .
but can you look at me
and tell me you &apos;re not the least bit curious ?
you &apos;re at the same crossroads you were years ago .
claim your life this time .
live it the way you want to live it .
i did it . i broke into the school .
after all your family has been through this year ,
i &apos;m surprised to learn
that you &apos;re behind something like this .
i know , i know. and i apologize .
from what i can see ,
you always seem to be toeing the line of mediocrity , nathaniel .
your grades are average at best , almost as though
you &apos;re not committed to school or your future .
can we just move on
to the punishment part of this meeting , please ?
certainly .
but i &apos;m curious .
can you please describe how you broke into the school ?
i can do betr . i can show you .
and how did you get access to this key ?
you &apos;re not on the swim team. not a janitor , right ? no .
where &apos;s the key chain ? the key chain ?
do you remember its color ? size ?
what it &apos;s made of ?
anything at all ?
who are you trying to protect ?
may i have a word ?
off camera .
uh , sure. but i think i know what you &apos;re gonna say .
and i can save you the indignity of groveling
by telling you right now--
no way are you gonna get that tape .
i wasn &apos;t going to grovel ,
and the fact that you even went there makes it clear
you have no idea who you &apos;re dealing with .
what are you gonna do to me , blair ?
blackball me from eating yogurt on the met steps ?
you have nothing i need. you put that footage in your film ,
you won &apos;t be able to show it . i won &apos;t sign a release .
i &apos;m not looking for a distribution deal ,
just a local arts grant so i can pay my rent .
now if you &apos;ll excuse me ...
you &apos;re in my shot .
what &apos;s that , your stripper money ?
$ 10,000 for the tape .
you think i &apos;d take your money ?
yes , i do . i know girls like you .
you act like money &apos;s not important .
the truth is , money &apos;s important to everyone .
and i thought blair was manipulative .
blair &apos;s an amateur. she thinks you &apos;re just like her .
to blair ,
this money is a couple pairs of manolos and a chanel bag .
but i know that this much cash
can make a real difference in your life .
you &apos;re sick .
you &apos;re welcome .
who knew b. and c. were such patrons of the arts ?
call it philanthropy or bribery .
it looks like everyone has their price .
something on your mind , lily ?
yeah ?
what are you saying ?
i &apos;m sorry. it &apos;s sheldon .
he has those numbers i was asking for .
do you mind ?
no. yeah .
just make sure he gets it at the current rate .
the dollar &apos;s been all over the place .
hello ?
i was thinking about what you said .
let &apos;s do it .
let &apos;s see what we are. let &apos;s see what we could be .
who is this ? rufus ...
lily , this is great. do you know how great this is ?
well , yes . i mean , i @-@ i do . i mean , i think so. let &apos;s go away tonight .
let &apos;s pack a bag .
let &apos;s get away from everyone , everything ,
just figure it out. wh @-@ where would we go ?
who cares ?
okay , sounds like a plan .
um ... 90th and 5th . 6 : 00 ?
okay .
i &apos;m scared , rufus ...
in a good way .
me , too .
settle down , please .
yesterday , i talked about the serious consequences ...
for your dishonorable actions ,
and obviously , you didn &apos;t believe me .
but someone came forward today and claimed responsibility ...
do you know who ?
for a crime he did not commit .
and although i appreciate his self @-@ sacrifice ,
i don &apos;t abide dishonesty .
and i think it &apos;s time you all know how serious i am .
nathaniel archibald is suspended from st. jude &apos;s .
and , yes , this will go on his transcript .
effective immediately .
mr. archibald ,
you know where to find the exit .
this just in--nate archibald , dead man walking .
we hear st. jude &apos;s has a new policy
an eye for a lie .
watch him go , students .
who wants to be next ?
until one of you comes forward , we &apos;ll keep going
until every last one of you has walked out that door .
i don &apos;t believe this .
dan , it &apos;s okay . serena , i @-@ i can &apos;t-- i can &apos;t get expelled .
i cannot get suspended .
my whole future is riding on this .
if you know who broke in , then why won &apos;t you give them up ?
because it was me .
so why--why didn &apos;t you tell me right away ?
cause i didn &apos;t want you to judge me. aren &apos;t we already beyond that ?
and i didn &apos;t want you to know
because i didn &apos;t want you to have to be in the position you &apos;re in now
of having to choose between protecting me and helping yourself .
so how &apos;d you even get in ?
i have a key. you had a key to the pool ?
all right , what happened to being beyond this ?
sorry .
the end of freshman year ,
i kind of dated the swim team captain ,
and he gave me a key so that we could ...
you know , meet up , and ... that &apos;s--enough said .
and saturday night-- what happened then ?
well , blair and i ran out of places to go ,
and she knew i still had a key ,
and ... before i knew it , it &apos;s like we were all there .
and i thought it was just gonna be us girls .
and then everybody got on their phone ,
and more people started showing up , and ...
i just never thought anybody was gonna get hurt .
yeah. well , you can still tell queller the truth .
i think she &apos;ll respect your honesty. yeah , like she respected nate &apos;s ?
no , nate lied .
and besides , you &apos;re serena van der woodsen .
you didn &apos;t know me before i went away .
barely got back into constance .
if i got expelled ,
i don &apos;t think any school in town would take me .
i &apos;m sure that &apos;s not true .
i can &apos;t risk going back to boarding school ,
being away from you and eric .
but i don &apos;t want you to lose your future .
you really can be damned if you do and screwed if you don &apos;t .
dan humphrey ,
headmistress queller is requesting
to see y u iher office after class .
nate .
hey. are you okay ?
yeah , i &apos;ll be fine. it &apos;s , uh ...
my parents have so much other stuff going on right now ...
they &apos;ll get over it. either way , it was worth it .
worth it ? yes . blair , i know how much your future means to you .
and you &apos;ve worked so hard for yale and everything--
what are you talking about ?
you don &apos;t have to lie . i saw the key in your bedroom .
that key isn &apos;t mine .
i was st hiding it for someone else .
wait ...
that &apos;s why you were suspended ?
you told the headmistress it was yours
because you thought it was mine ?
that &apos;s the most romantic thing anyone has ever done for me .
i love you .
please. you and i just can &apos;t happen right now .
why not ?
i don &apos;t want to be with you .
good catching up .
you &apos;re home early .
please don &apos;t tell me you &apos;re expelled. not yet .
your position at that school is already too precarious .
one false move , and you know what ?
i can &apos;t do anything to help you . i know . i know .
i just wanna hide under the covers and make it all go away .
and apparently , you do , too .
you and bart just got back. why are you packing again ?
well , i was just gonna go for a , you know ,
a little spa trip for the weekend .
cause you &apos;re so stressed out from your vacation ?
aren &apos;t you gonna answer that ? no , i don &apos;t think so .
mom , is dan &apos;s dad the reason
you haven &apos;t answered bart &apos;s proposal ?
you can &apos;t .
please , mom , not this one .
look , i will not base my personal life
on your preferences .
dan is my boyfriend .
and i know we &apos;re too young to talk about forever ,
but right now that &apos;s what it feels like .
i know it does , sweetie , but-- but what ?
tell me that rufus is that important to you .
tell me that whatever the two of you have
is the most important thing in your life ,
because that &apos;s what dan is to me , mom .
the most important .
i would rather be chuck &apos;s stepsister than dan &apos;s .
please don &apos;t do this to me .
dan means that much to you ?
yeah , he does .
in fact , i have to go. wait. where ?
school. there &apos;s something i have to do .
and i hope there &apos;s something you have to do , too .
what are you doing here ?
i brought this for you .
what &apos;s the catch ?
i know this might come as a shock ,
but not everyone operates from an agenda .
in fact , some people do things
simply because it &apos;s the decent thing to do .
smash it , burn it , whatever. there are no copies .
what about the one you gave to chuck ?
it &apos;s blank , which i &apos;m sure he &apos;ll be thrilled to discover .
and about what &apos;s on that tape-- having observed you
in your natural habitat these past few days ...
nate seems like one of the good guys ,
and you seem to really care about him .
mr. humphrey , you have a partial scholarship at st. jude &apos;s .
you are number two in your class ,
have a stellar recommendation for dartmouth from j.l. hall .
it looks as if your dreams are well within grasp .
thank you , thank you. yeah , i guess they are .
but it seems you &apos;re in with a new crowd this year ,
dating serena van der woodsen ...
is that on my file ?
who had the key to the school ?
i don &apos;t know .
let me remind you one last time
that you are in a different position than the others .
you need this school .
headmistress queller , i have something to tell you .
i must say , your file reads more like a rap sheet .
you cut more sophomore classes than you attended ,
cheated on tests , talked back to teachers. look ,
i understand that this is a serious matter .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s important to me
that you know-- you being new here--
that the person that you just described
is not w i am anymore .
oh , no ? who are you now ?
well , my grades are up ,
my attendance is nearly perfect ,
and i &apos;ve stayed out of trouble .
until now .
please understand
that i never intended for anything bad to happen .
and it may have taken some time , but i am here now ,
accepting responsibility for my actions .
whatever you think is fair .
yes , let &apos;s discuss the ...
consequences .
i &apos;ll be brief .
and ...
i &apos;ll be not interested. is that how you speak to the person
who just paid your rent for a year ? what did you just say ?
congratulations , vanessa .
you just won 365 more days in your ikea @-@ furnished closet .
you went to my building ? you talked to my landlord ?
no , i don &apos;t speak ukrainian ,
but i do speak envelope of cash .
and he understood me perfectly .
i can &apos;t believe you . blair waldorf is not indebted to anyone ,
no matter how much i appreciate what you did .
you &apos;re welcome , i guess ?
good. now this transaction is finished ,
and i &apos;m free to return to disliking you .
i wouldn &apos;t have it any other way .
oh , and one more thing .
if you didn &apos;t pay your rent with it ,
what did you do with chuck &apos;s money ?
i may have created
a medical grant for teens with genital herpes ...
in his name .
i can &apos;t believe she didn &apos;t expel me .
yeah , i know. it &apos;s shocking .
i--you--25 hours of community outreach .
that &apos;s not bad at all .
i mean , i probably would &apos;ve done it anyway
being as i &apos;m on the committee. that had occurred to me. yeah .
wait. what are you saying ?
no , no , i &apos;m not saying anything. believe me .
so you don &apos;t buy what she said
about me being the poster child for the new honor code ?
look , i know for a fact
my mom didn &apos;t plead my case or donate anything , okay ?
i didn &apos;t say a thing .
are you really turning this
into an &quot; upstairs , downstairs &quot; thing ?
no. no , you are . i &apos;m being completely silent .
i &apos;m just happy that you &apos;re not being expelled
or leaving town anytime soon. are you hungry ? we should ... always .
but you still believe that there &apos;s a double standard ,
that people like me get specl treatment .
ms. van der woodsen. your mother sent me to pick you up .
oh. great .
that was ... thoughtful .
i think you get no special treatment at all .
your life is completely uncharmed and ... average .
it &apos;s okay . i &apos;ll walk .
no , come on . i &apos;m--i was kidding . i was kidding .
you going to brooklyn ?
it &apos;s a rare occasion
to celebrate the merging of two families .
and i couldn &apos;t be happier to be here tonight
to celebrate lily &apos;s acceptance of my proposal .
so to my lovely bride
and our growing family .
you packed light .
please try to understand .
i think i do .
i &apos;m just sorry .
so am i .
mom looks about as happy as grandma at last call . i know .
it seems bart &apos;s personality-- or lack thereof--is contagious .
i don &apos;t even know
how she breathes with her blouse buttoned that high .
how glad are you to see our families merge , sis ?
so glad that if you ever call me that again ,
it &apos;ll be the last thing you ever say , chuck .
i love it--our first brother / sister squabble .
i hope you &apos;re going to make yourself available
for more missed childhood memories--
bathing together , for example .
you &apos;re probably wondering why i asked you here .
after our last conversation , yeah .
do you think it &apos;s possible
for two people who have been through as much as we have
to really forgive and forget ?
if we really want to , i think we can .
a lot of mistakes have been made .
if you &apos;re ready to forgive me ...
then nothing can tear us apart .
i promise .
what you said before ...
i love you , too .
always have , always will .
so ...
your new stepbrother told me about your problem at school .
frankly , i wasn &apos;t surprised ,
given your propensity for recklessness and adventure .
i &apos;m sorry ?
don &apos;t tell your mother , but i made a call .
you did what ? it was harder than usual .
that new headmistress of yours is a real piece of work .
i had to go over her head .
sorry i couldn &apos;t get the charges completely dropped , but , um ...
at least i got you a minimal sentence .
one thing about being on the inside--
once you get there ,
you don &apos;t always get to choose where you stand ... or sit .
i was just looking out for my family .
the new van der woodsen / bass library
should be completed for eric &apos;s graduation .
i can see that lily and i
are gonna have our hands full with the two of you .
will you excuse me ? i need some air .
sometimes you need to step outside ,
clear your head
and remind yourself of who you are ...
and where you want to be .
hey. aren &apos;t you supposed to be at your mom &apos;s engagement thing ?
yeah , well , i had to get out of there .
it was getting a little hard to breathe , you know ?
those parties can be that way .
so are you , um , packing up your music ?
nah . i just ...
need to find something new to write about .
and i will .
hey. you &apos;re a little overdressed
for the study date i didn &apos;t know we had .
you were right about everything .
you wanna talk about it ?
can i just sit here with you for a while ?
yeah .
chaucer ? yeah , i got a test on friday .
mine &apos;s thursday .
and sometimes you have to venture outside your world
in order to find yourself .
as for me , i &apos;m happy right where i am .
i only wanna be with you .
