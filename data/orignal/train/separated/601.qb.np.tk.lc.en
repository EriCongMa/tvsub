第六季 第一集
yahoo !
welcome back to greendale ,
now ranking fifth on colorado &apos;s
alphabetical listing of community colleges .
rest in peace , bad boy slim &apos;s dj school .
this school owes its continued existence to the following heroes .
jeff winger ,
a teacher so dedicated to clean energy ,
he &apos;s already parking like his car is electric .
britta perry , currently raising awareness of homelessness ,
not that she has a choice .
abed nadir , who actually wrote this announcement
for the sake of , as he put it , catching everyone up .
and annie edison who led the effort to save
greendale from 534 critical emergencies .

hey leonard , what , are you gonna bogart the disc all day ?
like tears in rain .
what ?
i can &apos;t believe the roof collapsed .
we almost killed fat neil .
that was garrett .
see , we &apos;re monsters .
okay , if they blame us for this , let me take the heat .
i &apos;d never see the inside of a cell .
i have been reliving this day over and over for a thousand years .
guys , this is not on us .
that roof was gonna collapse , 80 % of the rubble was styrofoam .
speaking of guilt , where &apos;s shirley ?
you didn &apos;t tell him ?
i was waiting until we were all together .
abed &apos;s not comfortable with c @-@ h @-@ a @-@ n @-@ g @-@ e.
hey , screw you .
i can spell .
screw you .
is shirley gone ?
did she spin off ?
nobody spins off in real life , abed .
shirley went to look after her dad in atlanta
and ended up taking a job as a personal chef to a brilliant ,
but troubled southern detective .
i told her i &apos;d manage her sandwich shop while she &apos;s gone .
oh , that &apos;s very generous of you .
i have a friend in town ,
every time you &apos;re gonna need help with that .
she &apos;ll be back .
like troy ?
are any of you white people
noticing what &apos;s happening to this group ?
do abed and i need to be concerned ?
you have my word , as leader of the white people
there &apos;s no cause for alarm .
say hello to new shirley .
just kidding .
this is francesca dart .
i have brought her on as an administrative consultant .
i thought it would be fun , and mandatory for
you to add her to your little committee .
why , because one roof collapsed ?
no , god , god no .
i &apos;m your friend bringing you a new friend ,
one with training in not collapsing roofs .
is she , excuse me , ma &apos;am .
is she above us or below us ?
she is , woop !
i &apos;m getting a call , here , and i &apos;ll have to take it .
frankie , why don &apos;t you explain what your role will be ,
while i leave to take this call .
my phone is vibrating ,
but it is
in your office , which you didn &apos;t realize ,
when you started the fake phone call move .
my phone is in my pocket , jeffrey .
i &apos;m walking away , so i can get it out and answer it .
let me know how it goes .
okay , i &apos;ll just have a seat and- .
no ! - no !
no , no , no !
hey !
our friend use to sit there .
she spun off .
i &apos;m sorry , what about here ?
yeah , , i guess that &apos;s okay .
okay , so ,
i took an informal survey
to get a sense of how greendale is perceived .
and three themes emerged , weird .
passionate and gross .
now you want to hang onto that grouping .
in marketing , it &apos;s what we call the good belushi .
if i had a magic wand ,
i would use it to make sure greendale never had to grow up .
i would also probably use it to cut the magic wand class
that i noticed is actually offered here ,
as well as vcr repair , a class called ladders ,
and when is it okay to shake a baby ?
in terms of hierarchy , i &apos;m a big believer in it .
someone needs to say , i &apos;m in charge , and that person is me .
that &apos;s my decision .
that doesn &apos;t mean that we don &apos;t work together ,
but all communication and decisions will go through me .
i &apos;ll send out an email later to set up our next meeting .
awesome .
okay . great seeing you , professor .
yeah . coolios .
who in the crazy bitch ?
did that just happen ?
did you see her binder ?
pretty nondescript .
seems like she may be trouble .
to be fair , she &apos;s an additional white person ,
which has clearly become important here .
no , thank you .
i , i &apos;m just glad i was able to answer .
my , my phone got lodged in my pocket .
i know !
i guess that is a thing .
so , you were saying about the thing ,
the reason you were calling was ,
what were you talking to me about ?
looks good , tony .
i &apos;m sorry , i just assume your name is tony .
here you go .
i gave you some extra heat .
britta , what is the weekly cost of this restaurant ?
oh , that &apos;s easy .
my dignity .
seems like this sandwich counter is consuming your happiness and
converting it into burnt bread and debt .
so ?
frankie , hi .
someone removed all the liquor from the faculty lounge .
i &apos;m sorry , i cannot legally protect or insure
a campus with free flowing booze .
well , i can &apos;t teach with free flowing sobriety .
is that true ?
do you really think you &apos;re an addict ?
no .
dean !
yes , i can talk .
damn it .
i am available anytime for you .
frankie , frankie .
hi . i had an idea about how to deelectrify the pool .
oh , that &apos;s already been dealt with .
okay , well , then , there &apos;s- .
oh , let &apos;s see .
done , done , deloused .
appraised , defused , rebuilt .
de @-@ peanut buttered , debunked , spayed , neutered .
underway , resanctified , plunged ,
deported and exhumed .
thank you .
oh , this is pretty .
i &apos;m gonna name one of my sandwiches after her .
my sandwiches suck .
she is improving greendale .
yeah , but how much can you improve greendale
before it stops being greendale ?
she didn &apos;t suffer for this place .
she doesn &apos;t understand it .
she &apos;s gonna end up messing with something that- .
abed .
temporal mutation in english , doc .
simply put , mr. president ,
in 12 hours these dinosaurs will become- .
mind if i sit here ?
time @-@ asaurs .
go ahead , i can reshoot .
how &apos;s everything going ?
i have concerns .
i &apos;d like to hear them .
i &apos;m worried you &apos;re not distinct enough for manny
both in terms of physicality and purpose .
okay .
i can &apos;t determine if you have any specific flaw ,
quirk , or point of view that
makes you a creative addition to the group .
i don &apos;t know what that means , but i &apos;m writing it down .
my umbrella concern is that you , as a character ,
represent the end of what i used to call our show ,
which was once an unlikely family of misfit students ,
and is now a pretty loose knit group of students and teachers ,
none of whom are taking a class together in a school which ,
as of your arrival , is becoming increasingly grounded ,
asking questions like , how do any of us get our money ?
when will we get our degrees ?
and what happened to that girl i was dating ?
as opposed to questions i consider more important like ,
what is real ? what is sanity ?
is there a god ?
where &apos;s that pierce hologram ?
jeff said last year he saw a pierce hologram .
none of the rest of us have ever seen it .
so , if there &apos;s a pierce ghost on campus ,
i &apos;d like to get a head start on busting it .
all right . this is the first
i &apos;ve heard that i &apos;m a character on a show .
i &apos;m excited to be one , but i agree , i &apos;ll be a boring one .
quirks are not my strong suit , results are .
i love quirky people .
i come from a big family of people who are literally insane .
i moved down here to take care of one of them .
but i myself am exceptionally boring ,
and i am quite proud to be that way ,
because it allows me to help
the ess boring people turn quirks into results .
that &apos;s the most interesting take on
not being interesting that i &apos;ve ever heard .
as far as what i represent about your show ,
i wouldn &apos;t give me or anyone else that kind of power .
good shows change , i assume .
personally , i don &apos;t own a tv .
you &apos;re the first person to say that
that i didn &apos;t immediately delete from my brain .
thank you .
emergency meeting at shirley &apos;s sandwiches right now .
everyone freaking out .
new lady is evil .
crazy frown .
i should go .
abed , i could really use someone &apos;s help
in learning the ropes around here .
i &apos;ll ask around .
friends , dumb hats .
totally talking down to you .
she hates you .
i got it from jared .
what are you guys doing back here ?
are you the big chilling ?
yeah , only there &apos;s not a hippie that died
to make us come together and complain .
it &apos;s our school .
frankie &apos;s taking over the campus .
she cancelled ladder &apos;s , she &apos;s banning substances ,
she wants to shut down shirley &apos;s sandwiches .
she called annie a bitch .
she implied i was a bitch .
she implied annie was a stuck up bitch
who thinks she &apos;s better than everyone .
okay , now you &apos;re just ...
she was nice to me .
in fact we kinda got along .
abed , are you sure she wasn &apos;t actually being sweetly condescending ?
yup , i learned to pick up on that one .
i make a movement that we form a separate , secret , committee .
i second britta &apos;s motion , not movement .
i third annie &apos;s number two @-@ ing of the movement brita made .
gross .
our mission to preserve the real greendale .
oppose frankie or drink .
whatever &apos;s easiest .
are you guys sure she &apos;s bad ?
are you sure you &apos;re not doing what i usually do ,
overreacting to change ?
nobody &apos;s ever doing what you usually do abed .
you &apos;re nuts .
in a good way .
i &apos;m just saying .
leave reality to us .
we always support you .
don &apos;t make it more dramatic than it is .
it &apos;s a blood oath to defy evil .
you &apos;re either in or you &apos;re out .
can i hang around if i don &apos;t do the oath .
oh , gee . you mean just be friends ?
sure . great , abed .
okay .
can i have some pretzels ?
no .
those are secret committee pretzels .
okay .
yes , that was a test .
you guys are bad friends .
don &apos;t think of it as bad baking .
think of it as a crushing blow to a gender stereotype .
britta , it might help if every burnt sandwich
didn &apos;t come with a self @-@ aware burnt sandwich bit .
is that how you &apos;re gonna help increase sales , creative notes ?
i had that sign spinner idea .
we &apos;re a restaurant inside a cafeteria annie ,
our weak point wasn &apos;t traffic .
flo , alice stop fighting ,
can &apos;t afford to lose this place .
if i have to start drinking in the men &apos;s room ,
the score in my head has to change from trent reznor
to johnny cash doing trent reznor .
约翰尼 · 卡什 美国乡村音乐创作歌手
i &apos;m a bartender annie ,
i know a little bit more about the human side of service .
i can &apos;t eat this .
can i have my money back ?
you &apos;re human garbage .
hi , mr. winger .
nice lecture yesterday .
don &apos;t patronize me dick .
it might not seem like this ,
but you &apos;re killing small , black owned business .
i &apos;ll call it even for a drink with mr. winger .
that &apos;s absurd .
you will ?
let &apos;s see some id . you snitch , you die .
morning .
morning .
morning .
well i guess we &apos;ll wait for the others before we start .
i don &apos;t think they &apos;re coming .
what ?
the committee had a meeting last night and decided you are evil .
ooh . wait , you guys had a meeting last night ?
so , we broke up as friends .
because i don &apos;t think you &apos;re evil .
i think you scare people ,
because you live in the real world instead of up your butt .
i &apos;m sorry that happened , abed .
it &apos;s like i said yesterday at lunch .
drama and conflict are exciting and easy .
making a difference can be pretty boring .
you guys had lunch ?
i &apos;d like to try to live in that world .
i &apos;m a little tired from all the drama ,
the heroes , the villains , monsters .
pokemons .
you &apos;re just a person that sees things the way they are .
leprechauns . scary .
i don &apos;t know if i can be like that but
i don &apos;t think it makes sense to be against it .
you guys ever hear of the slender man ?
i &apos;d like to try to help you .
and if possible , learn from you .
you guys on reddit , 4chan ?
that would be great , abed .
cuz it &apos;s awesome .
i think we &apos;d all benefit if we were more like you ,
so what do you say ?
let &apos;s order some food .
let &apos;s save greendale .
let &apos;s save greendale .
tacos !
we are something else .
abed .
abed .
what are you doing ?
what do you mean ?
someone told me you were sweeping , straightening clocks .
why are you cleaning that sign ?
i gave you a list .
yeah , the list felt pretty similar visually .
i can &apos;t picture a montage cutting from
me verifying diane &apos;s invoice to me
emailing confirmation to diane .
right .
but a montage is what , abed ?
it &apos;s a movie apologizing for reality .
and we are where ?
reality .
and what do people do here ?
they email diane ?
abed , if you change your clothes one more time today , you &apos;re fired .
sorry .
hey , abed .
hey , todd .
are annie and britta around ?
no .
abed , maybe you should order the special .
i &apos;ll have the special .
the specials are kept in the back .
you should , you should go in the back .
i &apos;d like the special .
vaporizers , skittles ?
abed .
hey , annie .
this place is so conceptual .
it &apos;s practical , too .
we made enough money to save shirley &apos;s .
and in an ironic way .
because if shirley saw this , her soul would die .
hey , abed , check this out .
oh , britta &apos;s still the worst ?
yeah .
the bar gets dirty .
you &apos;re gonna need someone to clean it , probably after hours .
and those floor polishers can get pretty loud .
i &apos;d hate for someone to hear it .
you blackmailing me ?
just talking shop .
what &apos;s the rumpus , abed ?
miller &apos;s crossing .
this is really great .
you guys should be proud of yourselves .
we missed you .
have a drink .
put on an old timey jacket .
that &apos;s okay , i don &apos;t really do this anymore .
all right , come on .
i said i don &apos;t do this , see .
you dirty rat .
guys are all dirty rats .
what &apos;s your romper room ?
all right , maybe just one drink .
then maybe cut to a montage of drinks .
let &apos;s never stop being friends again ever .
cheers !
we shouldn &apos;t have made you choose between frankie and us .
oh , she &apos;s good for business .
we &apos;re sorry that we made you choose between-
you &apos;re just repeating what i said .
no , you &apos;re repeating what i said .
oh , i &apos;m a time traveler ?
this is the show .
abed , i just got word from diane
that one of your emails was a little shaky .
are you okay ?
i &apos;m good . late night last night .
yeah , i could use a little protein .
i &apos;m gonna go get an early lunch .
you guys know about tardigrades ?
they &apos;re these microscopic creatures that look like robot bears .
they can survive in space .
get into space , you dirty tardigrades , see ?
and they &apos;re everywhere .
there &apos;s a lot of little things in real life
that are just as cool as fake stuff .
i learned that working for frankie .
you guys would like her , you know .
raid !
is this what you guys want ?
you wanna play cops and robbers with costumes ?
why is that guy a carrot ?
because they ran out .
who tattled ?
in what world , brita , do you see this as covert
enough to require tattling ?
you built a bar in a school .
there was lumber involved .
i have been letting you hole up down here ,
because it kept you contained and satisfied ,
because you are all compulsively defiant , but it wasn &apos;t enough .
you had to drag abed back in , and abed deserves better .
oh , ho , ho , ho , ho , it finally comes out .
abed deserves better .
that &apos;s been out .
shut up , leonard .
i once mistook six people for you at a pharmacy .
it &apos;s not their fault , frankie .
i chose this .
these are my friends .
i hate emailing diane .
she can &apos;t commit to a font .
it &apos;s pathological , and so am i.
this is where i belong .
i know you think that , abed ,
but you don &apos;t know any better .
but shut up , leonard .
you are .
you are old .
and you deserve less , because of your age .
i don &apos;t , i don &apos;t actually believe that .
i &apos;m just trying to , i &apos;m trying to , and everybody here is a ,
is a fart ,
a livid fart from the butt of a lesser god .
i &apos;m , i &apos;m better than this .
cut to everyone on campus getting as drunk as they want montage .
frankie hasn &apos;t come back to work today .
that &apos;s terrible .
the insurance company dropped us .
the school has no insurance .
what was frankie &apos;s salary ?
a lot .
what were the insurance premiums ?
a lot .
add those two numbers together , that &apos;s your new school dance budget .
oh , nice .
welcome to ladder !
yeah !
ladder !
who wants to see the ladders professor go higher ?
ladder !
you did it , jeff winger !
this is your school now .
annie .
it was worth it .
all right , that should be the extent of the professor &apos;s medical bills .
what , what about that lawsuits from the students ?
i think we should fight those .
actually , i suggest you settle out of court .
this is my fault .
obviously not .
it &apos;s my fault .
it &apos;s my fault .
guys , it &apos;s my fault .
it &apos;s my fault .
it &apos;s my fault .
it &apos;s my fault .
it &apos;s my fault .
it &apos;s my fault .
it &apos;s my fault .
it &apos;s my fault .
it &apos;s my fault .
it &apos;s my fault .
it &apos;s my fault .
all right , all right , all right .
so , whose fault wasn &apos;t it ?
and who knows anything about handling anything like this ?
in terms of hierarchy , i &apos;m a big believer in it .
someone needs to say , i &apos;m in charge , and that person is me .
that &apos;s my decision .
wait , what ?
i &apos;m sorry ?
who talks like that ?
why would anyone hire someone so pompous ?
miss dart , word of advice ,
change your personality , or start looking for
companies run by insane people .
don &apos;t hire this woman .
fifth time &apos;s the charm .
he &apos;s barged the four offices screaming ,
don &apos;t hire this woman .
what the hell is going on ?
what are you doing here ?
how did you even find me ?
i emailed diane .
she knows way too much about your schedule , by the way .
whatever he &apos;s offering you , greendale , well ,
we can &apos;t double it .
we probably can &apos;t even match it .
whatever he &apos;s offering you ,
greendale will give you less , and an apology .
do you know ...
it &apos;s not enough , but
maybe if you added more apologies .
like a montage of them ?
we &apos;re sorry .
i told you i wouldn &apos;t be needing dinner tonight .
i &apos;m guessing you wouldn &apos;t .
not if you &apos;re looking for this .
how &apos;d you know ?
nobody makes more crumbs than a cook .
well , the same goes for clues and detectives .
you &apos;re too busy solving murders to get away with your own .
well , then , what about the case of my wife and my legs , shirley ?
can you solve that one , huh ?
can you ?
cuz if you can &apos;t , then i ain &apos;t got nothing to live for .
begging your pardon , mr. butcher .
i think the people on this bayou would disagree .
you rescued a runaway girl today .
rescued , balls .
i couldn &apos;t even rescue a , a bulb from a socket .
and you did all the work today , didn &apos;t you ?
i &apos;m just a detective from the swamps of atlanta ,
can &apos;t even walk .
then let me be your legs .
let me do for you what
i did today every week until you find your wife .
or your legs .
you are a stubborn son of a bitch , shirley bennett .
now come on . i have dinner to make .
you got cases to solve .
feeling someone &apos;s gonna murder some tater tots tonight .
that &apos;s no mystery at all .
next week , on the butcher and the baker ,
when a new detective on the bayou disappears ,
and butcher is the prime suspect ,
it &apos;s up to shirley to cook up some answers .
did you get any of that ?
