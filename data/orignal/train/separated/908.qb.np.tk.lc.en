back in the &apos; 80s before we could easily text money
to any charity we wished , we had the world @-@ famous
charity craze that completely swept the entire country .
hands across america -- it &apos;s happening this weekend ,
and you will not make coach look bad .
all right , listen up .
this limited @-@ edition , government @-@ issued visor
means that i have been personally appointed
regional captain because i volunteered .
it is my duty to make sure everybody in this town
forms a human chain to stop the homeless .
questions .
goldberg .
isn &apos;t it kind of mean to form a chain
and not let the homeless people pass through ?
that was my first thought , too ,
but it was explained to me that we would be allowing
the homeless to come and go as they please .
goldberg again .
still confused .
um , how does holding hands help anyone ?
hello .
everyone in america is gonna hold hands at once
to show we are symbolically unified
in our fight to end homelessness .
it &apos;s beautiful , really .
hell , i wish i had more than two hands .
yes , we get it .
you &apos;re the socially aware girl .
no reason to showboat about it , other goldberg .
i &apos;ll stop talking .
now , in the spirit of the event ,
let &apos;s hit the floor and practice .
let &apos;s go ! move it !
grab and squeeze , people !
interlace those fingers !
engage every digit !
i want to see hustle , and i want to see determination !
yeah ! let me feel it !
there it is -- a chain .
it was the second wednesday of the month , 1980 @-@ something ,
and the harvest hop was coming up .
it was the first dance where you had to ask someone .
i mean , seriously , why do i have to wait
for some meathead to ask me to a lame @-@ ass dance ?
because that &apos;s how society works .
count me out .
well , i have it on good authority
that adam abel is going to ask someone today .
i could give a crap about that nerd .
he &apos;s coming this way .
go , go , go !
pam , you , um , have a date to the dance and stuff ?
no .
are ... you okay ?
yeah .
why wouldn &apos;t i be ?
you sure you &apos;re okay ?
no , genius .
i &apos;m like the only girl who didn &apos;t get asked .
that &apos;s freaking humiliating .
well , you can always go with your awesome best friend .
stop ! it &apos;ll be fun .
we can goof on everyone .
dana can &apos;t fly out to go with me .
this way we &apos;re not total losers without dates .
normally , i &apos;d roll my eyes and punch you ,
but honestly , i &apos;m desperate , so yes .
dear god , yes .
get off me , dork .
you &apos;re a complicated person .
turns out the only good thing
about having a girlfriend in seattle
was i was completely free to help out a friend .
or not .
surprise !
what ? why ?
my grandma broke her hip ,
so my parents are letting me visit her .
so lucky .
for us -- she &apos;s bummed .
so we get to go to the dance !
yeah , about the dance .
oh , my god . you &apos;re not excited .
you &apos;re going with someone else ?
are we not us anymore ?
no , of course we &apos;re us .
i &apos;m going with you , my girlfriend , who i love .
i &apos;m so excited .
me also excited .
as i was reeling from my two dates to the dance ,
my mom was reeling after a visit with virginia kremp .
is that your family at the flower show again ?
&quot; the inquirer &quot; put your picture in the paper last year .
oh , well , charles won top florist again .
his topiary of rosa parks was the real star .
well , all i know is you got another
stunning picture of your whole family .
you &apos;re like the freaking kennedys of jenkintown .
please , no , we &apos;re not . do people really say that ?
i &apos;d give anything to have just one photo of me and my babies
looking that happy on the front page of the paper .
well , barry did make the paper for that time
he got in the fight with the service horse .
he really thought it was his apple .
horses are tricky .
yeah .
little did my mom know
her photo op was right around the corner .
oh , my god .
are you two crafting together ?
by choice ?
no , no , no , calm down . we &apos;re not crafting .
we &apos;re just making art with construction paper ,
markers , and glitter for public display .
that &apos;s crafting .
fine , we &apos;re crafting .
we need to spread the word about hands across america .
yeah , i don &apos;t know about that whole thing .
hands have germs .
think of all those colds passing across the country
like a big bacteria highway .
whatever .
i &apos;m doing it because it &apos;ll help people in real need .
and i &apos;m doing it for the celebrity contact .
hoping to hold hands with heather locklear .
no -- alyssa milano .
no -- k.i.t.t. , the car from &quot; knight rider . &quot;
you can &apos;t hold hands with a car , idiot .
i &apos;ll hold the antenna .
wait a minute .
celebrities are doing this ?
yeah , downtown philly actually nabbed scott baio .
from &quot; happy days &quot; and &quot; chachi in charge &quot; ?
don &apos;t forget &quot; zapped ! &quot; where he uses
his magic powers to lift girls &apos; dresses .
turn that off .
point is this thing &apos;s gonna be a huge deal .
it &apos;s literally going to be on the front page of all the papers .
you mean like newspapers ?
like the kind that take pictures of moms and their kids ?
what ?
what happened ?
i want to help with hands across america .
okay .
and by help , i mean push you aside and take over entirely .
i said okay .
really ?
i &apos;m in way over my head .
they want me to organize , make posters .
they gave me a pen and a ledger .
i don &apos;t know what to do with them .
to record the donations .
oh , no , i --
i &apos;ve been putting everybody &apos;s cash in a bag .
well , there must be thousands there .
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;m a gym teacher , i &apos;m not a count teacher .
you mean a math teacher ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m not an english teacher , either .
did you at least get us a celebrity ?
no , th-- we can &apos;t compete with philly .
philly is the paris of pennsylvania .
they got baio . we got jack squat .
you should go rest .
as my mom was saving coach mellor ,
i was racing for the one man who always rescued me .
dad .
yes .
i need help . where &apos;s pops ?
there he is . thank god .
pops , i have two dates to the dance .
way to go , kiddo !
no , it &apos;s a bad thing .
oh , yeah , it is .
no , i agreed to go with emmy mirsky
to cheer her up , but dana flew in .
then just tell emmy you &apos;re going with dana .
she &apos;ll understand .
no , she won &apos;t .
a guy dissed her , and i saw her cry for the first time ever .
then just tell dana you can &apos;t go with her .
she &apos;ll freak out if i go with another girl ,
even if it is emmy .
then take them both . they never even have to know .
like peter did on &quot; the brady bunch &quot; ?
i brady @-@ bunched two ladies at a u.s.o. dance back in &apos; 41 .
never felt so alive .
stop .
nobody &apos;s brady @-@ bunching anyone .
you want some real advice ?
don &apos;t be a moron .
seriously ?
that &apos;s your advice for everything .
it applies to everything .
i think i &apos;m gonna stick with pops &apos; advice .
all right , time for a tv master class
on how to juggle two dates at once .
first up , the gold standard --
&quot; the brady bunch , &quot; and i &apos;m peter .
because your weird voice cracks just like his ?
despite that shot at my self @-@ esteem ,
i knew with the help of my trusty tv shows ,
i could pull off two dates at once .
oh , no ! peter brady , you blew it .
or so i thought .
no ! alex p . keaton .
each one was worse than the next .
jack &apos;s screwed !
both women are at the regal beagle .
as we watched the same plot done on every show ,
it became abundantly clear .
dude , it can &apos;t be done .
shut up , dave kim !
i see that .
as my universe was crumbling , my mom saw a world
where she finally got a photo in the paper with her kids .
yo , yo , yo , volunteers .
who &apos;s ready to get this homeless party started ?
mom , what are you doing here ?
you &apos;re looking at the new regional captain
for hands across america .
what happened to coach mellor ?
he cracked under the pressure , but don &apos;t worry .
mama &apos;s here .
i know how important this is for you .
yeah , i &apos;m out .
me too . shut it down , people .
whoa , hold up .
now that i &apos;m involved , you &apos;re just gonna bail ?
nothing personal -- you just make fun things suck .
well , that --
that is a shame because this lady right here
just got scott baio
to ditch philly and come to j @-@ town .
dude , we got fonzie &apos;s cousin .
no , everyone stop .
mom , did you really get scott baio ?
i literally just got off the phone with scotty b .
he told me to call him scotty b .
and he agreed to come here and hold hands with me .
i call the one available hand .
no way -- the hand is mine !
okay , this is my future husband . why do you care ?
&apos;cause he &apos;s my future best bro .
and once scott meets me ,
he &apos;ll ditch willie ames and fly me to hollywood
so i never have to talk to you people again .
this is bullcrap -- just &apos; cause your crazy @-@ hot mom is in charge ,
you guys both get dibs ?
please , mrs . goldberg , pick me .
i really need a win -- so bad .
no , i want scott &apos;s
mom , you have seen his poster
hand in my hand .
in my room .
i bet my hands are cooler than yours if we held them together .
mrs. goldberg -- - no , stop fighting . stop fighting .
i &apos;ll sleep on it , okay ?
i &apos;ll sleep on it , all right ?
but now i have to immediately leave --
not to call scott baio &apos; cause i &apos;ve done it .
all right , i just -- i have to go and do a thing .
the dance was only a day away ,
and i realized my plan was a dead end .
pops , i watched all the shows -- two dates never works .
not even on &quot; cheers &quot; ?
cliff had a date with carla and diane to the postman &apos;s ball .
it was a total junk show .
see , i &apos;m not a fan of today &apos;s comedy .
now , &quot; the honeymooners &quot; --
i don &apos;t need a trip down memory lane .
i need help ,
and you said you pulled off the perfect brady bunch .
how ?
actually , the women kind of invited me .
we &apos;ve got some advice for you .
yeah , yeah , don &apos;t be a moron .
if you know the advice , why aren &apos;t you following it ?
don &apos;t worry , kiddo . pops always has a plan .
with my help , you &apos;ll be the first kid
in history to juggle two dates at a dance .
well , i did juggle three grapes at camp .
you know who &apos;s not a moron ?
you &apos;re not a moron .
you &apos;re not a moron .
you &apos;re not a moron .
no .
as pops was convincing me i could pull this off ,
erica and barry were ready to convince our mom
that they were worthy of baio &apos;s hand .
erica , what &apos;s going on ?
bad dream , mama . can we do spoonies ?
oh , my god , spoonies ?
get on in the warm spot , girl .
this is so nice .
speaking of , um , any thoughts about scott baio ?
uh , yeah , about that ...
knock , knock .
who wants brekky in bed ?
you made mama breakfast ?
nobody cares because i &apos;m spending
the whole day with my favorite lady .
you are ?
well , mom and i are spending the entire weekend together .
we are ?
stop doing what you &apos;re doing .
you stop .
you &apos;re only giving spoons
so she &apos;ll pick you to hold baio &apos;s hand .
oh , and you &apos;re not ? what &apos;s with the stupid sweater ?
my favorite sweater ?
mommy made it for my 12th birthday .
i feel so handsome , mommy .
you look so handsome , schmoofers .
she &apos;s the sun .
i &apos;m the moon .
you &apos;re the moon !
okay , you want to go to war ? let &apos;s go .
mommy , i want you to pick out a guy for me to date and marry .
that is my dream .
no , no , no ! not so fast .
i &apos;ve been thinking about it , and i &apos;m gonna let you
dance with me before i dance with my bride at my wedding .
that is also my dream , but i also get to wear white .
that &apos;s non @-@ negotiable .
yes !
i &apos;m gonna have five kids , and i want you to babysit
every night and tell me what to do .
you will live with me forever .
i will build a mother suite off the master bedroom
even if it severely damages my marriage .
i &apos;m out . it &apos;s too rich for my blood .
yes ! i win !
oh , no , what have i done ?
future barry &apos;s problem .
despite herself , my mom loved her kids fighting over her .
just one problem -- she was now pulling a classic
baio and switch and needed a way out . careful .
we need to talk .
whoa , not so fast .
that was a non @-@ sanctioned sit @-@ down .
on your feet .
please , i need your help .
this whole thing has gotten away from me .
no , no , coach has washed his hands of hands across america .
look , all i wanted was one photo op with my kids .
now they &apos;re fighting over my love to get to baio .
that feather @-@ haired man @-@ boy is making all my dreams come true .
that &apos;s why we need to get him here instead of philly .
give up on your baio dreams .
it ain &apos;t happening .
it has to happen .
i told the whole school he &apos;s coming here .
what ? why would you do that ?
i thought i could work my yenta magic ,
but i &apos;ve been calling for three days .
baio &apos;s people are icing me out .
well , how the hell can i help ?
come on , you must have at least one celebrity lead .
no , i &apos;m a gym teacher . i rotate two pairs of shorts .
then i guess it &apos;s over .
unless you got out and you get yourself
a celebrity that &apos;s better than baio .
better than baio ? is that possible ?
it is with one of my patented game @-@ day pep talks .
now , listen up .
it &apos;s the fourth quarter . you &apos;re down by 1 point .
who &apos;s gonna run the option and take it to the big house ?
run the what ?
all right .
it &apos;s 11 : 00 p.m.
you just got off a flight with your family .
they &apos;re crabby . they &apos;re hungry .
you look in the cupboard .
oh , all you got is one can of tuna .
but it doesn &apos;t matter &apos; cause there &apos;s only one person
that can feed those babies tuna
and make sure they go to sleep with full tum @-@ tums .
me !
you &apos;re damn right it &apos;s you .
now go out and get yourself the biggest celebrity
this god @-@ forsaken town &apos;s ever seen .
sorry . my bad , little ones .
you guys okay ?
all right , let &apos;s take a breather .
who wants water ?
that night , i was also on a mission --
make a foolproof plan to bring two dates to the same dance .
all right , boys , let &apos;s run this again .
what are we looking at ?
the gym is 94x50 feet .
that leave us with two large zones to keep the girls apart .
check . let &apos;s talk song list .
we &apos;re looking at 16 songs lasting 2 hours and 6 minutes
including &quot; the time warp . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s do a dry run . adam .
the terrordrome is our battlefield .
i &apos;m michelangelo .
dana is princess leia .
emmy &apos;s the hulk .
copy -- song 1 .
&quot; like a prayer , &quot; madonna .
dana and i dance , then i say i got
to hit the bathroom and run to emmy .
song 2 .
&quot; careless whisper , &quot; wham !
i tell emmy i &apos;ll grab her punch
then run back to dana for a slow dance .
i interrupt and pretend i lost my contact lens .
i leave to help dave kim then book it back to emmy .
see that ? working as a team together .
trust me -- this whole thing is wired .
what the hell ?
&apos;sup , jerk ?
balls .
you didn &apos;t know she was staying with me ?
balls , balls .
hello , my name is dave kim . i lost my contact lens .
dana , can you help me find it
for 8 to 10 minutes out of earshot ?
not now , dave kim . it &apos;s gone to hell .
we didn &apos;t even make it out of the house .
i know .
two dates can &apos;t be done .
i know !
dude , he &apos;s created a whole nerd world to plot against us .
this is super @-@ creepy , adam .
my god , did you make me the hulk ?
yes , but only &apos; cause i don &apos;t like you when you &apos;re angry .
this is so scheming and disrespectful .
no , please , don &apos;t start doubting my character .
group hug ?
ugh , just leave us alone , liar .
okay .
new advice -- lay low .
now that i can pull off .
but that was impossible &apos; cause the next day ,
literally everyone in the country
gathered for hands across america .
adam , over here ! it &apos;s your mama .
so instead , i hid .
don &apos;t ignore me . i &apos;m regional captain .
i deserve respect .
no , no , no .
i &apos;m hiding in the shadows , okay ?
what are you talking about ?
today is the day that me and my kids
finally get on the front page of the newspaper .
all of us -- no exceptions .
yes , i @-@ i @-@ i &apos;ll hide with you people .
block my head with your enormous hair .
i &apos;m so nervous for baio .
my hands are super @-@ sweaty but soft .
i &apos;ve been moisturizing all day . so where is he ?
yeah , where &apos;s the scottster anyway ?
oh , my god , no !
you can &apos;t lure scott
with your off @-@ the @-@ shoulder crop top and short skirt .
you really think i would use my young feminine form
to get scott baio &apos;s attention ?
i do look good , though , right ?
uh , actually , i have some good news , bad news .
uh , the bad news is baio &apos;s not coming .
what ?
you monster !
no , stop it .
i actually got a bigger celebrity .
michael jackson ?
rob lowe ?
jermaine jackson .
better -- i have the most famous person
in philadelphia history .
please give a warm hands across america welcome
to ben franklin .
good morrow , fellow colonists .
i am founding father , benjamin franklin .
allow me to gaze upon you through my bifocals ,
which i invented in 1784 .
why is this thing still talking ?
ooh , the paper &apos;s here .
okay , everybody hold hands and sing .
bev , i don &apos;t think the rest of the country is ready just yet .
you never even had scott baio , did you ?
no time to talk .
all right , adam , stop hiding in my hair .
emmy , dana , come and hold hands and take a picture .
we &apos;d rather not .
they &apos;d really rather not .
okay , well , it &apos;s not a choice .
every hand not held is another homeless family .
i don &apos;t think -- - okay , just do it , just do it .
photographers !
smile , smile . teeth , teeth .
i &apos;d like to , but they &apos;re crushing my bones
with their strong lady hands .
mine too . i &apos;m just a pawn !
this is a nightmare !
how are they stronger than us ?
the moment had come .
it was finally time to hold hands across america .
boys , quick ! grab mommy &apos;s hands !
holy crap , it &apos;s happening .
okay . come on , you guys .
you &apos;ve got to hold my hand .
hold my hand , damn it .
no way . you lied to us .
beverly , what are you doing ?
come on , it &apos;s time . hold hands .
kids , do it .
never .
hold my hands .
we will hold no hands .
what is wrong with you people ? !
please !
no way .
this is for the homeless !
hold my hands .
no way .
hold hands !
please , just hold my hands .
never .
no way .
hold hands !
i shall hold your hand .
oh off , ben franklin .
mom , no ! back off , mom .
i &apos;m not holding your hand .
no , no , don &apos;t put that in the paper .
it &apos;s gonna look like the goldbergs broke hands across america .
goldbergs -- got it .
oh , that &apos;s a keeper .
and so , hands across america was single @-@ handedly a bust .
all i wanted was one nice photo for the wall .
that &apos;s all i ever wanted .
no .
no , you &apos;re the one who lied .
you can &apos;t make us feel bad about this .
as my mom &apos;s spirit was crushed , so were my hands .
how you holding up ?
well , i &apos;ve got no girlfriend , no best friend ,
and no feeling in both hands , so not good .
you know what i think ?
yes , i &apos;m a moron . i get it .
no , i don &apos;t think you do .
when i say , &quot; don &apos;t be a moron , &quot; it really means something .
you mean beyond just being rude and insulting ?
yeah , that &apos;s just part of it .
but it &apos;s my way of saying be honest , be a good person .
it &apos;s how i live my life , and you know what ?
it works .
so , how do i make it up to emmy and dana ?
that &apos;s easy .
don &apos;t be a moron .
after years of getting advice on girls from pops ,
i learned my dad had some wisdom to offer after all .
what the hell are you doing , weirdo ?
i &apos;m cordially and blatantly inviting you both to the dance .
you can &apos;t be serious .
look , i screwed up , but you have to believe me
all i wanted was to make both of you feel special .
emmy , you &apos;ve been my best friend since second grade .
i just couldn &apos;t bear to see you so sad .
and , dana , the last thing i &apos;d ever want to do is
to hurt the girl i love more than anything in this world .
point is i &apos;m a moron .
we &apos;ll got get dressed .
as it turns out , the best plan of all was honesty .
and because of that , i was able to do what alex p . keaton ,
jack tripper , and peter brady never could ...
... take two girls to the same dance .
and not just any girls ...
... the most important ones in my life .
and it was a night i always remember .
crying at &quot; zapped ! &quot; that &apos;s a first .
no , i just -- i feel bad .
i &apos;m a bad mama .
i don &apos;t think any of us were at our best .
which actually worked in our favor .
this ... is
not what i meant at all .
i know we &apos;re not actually holding hands ,
but if this picture isn &apos;t us , i don &apos;t know what is .
you &apos;re right .
i love it .
that &apos;s the thing about the people you love .
it &apos;s not always picture @-@ perfect .
sometimes you have to live in the moment and take it all in .
but side @-@ by @-@ side , hand @-@ in @-@ hand ...
... you &apos;ll find it &apos;s pretty great .
and sure , you may make a lot of mistakes along the way .
growing up is a tricky dance ,
but occasionally , you find your groove .
last dance of the night .
have fun , dorks .
actually i don &apos;t think you should take off just yet .
i talked to adam abel .
i &apos;m gonna kill you .
he saved you a dance .
i love you .
i don &apos;t understand how we all got the flu .
i told you , with all that hand holding ,
you &apos;d catch a bug .
will you stop saying that . it &apos;s not even how it works .
sounds like we may have a special visitor .
what , did scott baio &apos;s people finally get back to you ?
no , but ,
i still have ben franklin rented for an hour .
good morrow , sick children .
as i so famously said in 1780 @-@ something ,
an apple a day keeps the doctor--
no !
not again .
i hate this president .
