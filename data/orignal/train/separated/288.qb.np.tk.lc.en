girls , i have made a big decision .
you &apos;re having a sex change ?
i totally support you , but be careful , han .
female to male is very tricky .
well , you would know .
me @-@ ow !
he must have already started on the hormones .
now , here &apos;s my big decision .
we &apos;re moving from those icky glass ketchup bottles
to modern , new squeeze bottles .
wow , that is some fresh , outside @-@ the @-@ box thinking .
it &apos;s like being an intern at apple during the summer of &apos; 76 .
是在1976年成立的 &quot; 苹果电脑公司 &quot;
that &apos;s right . call me &quot; han jobs . &quot;
oh , i will only call you &quot; han jobs . &quot;
i can &apos;t believe everybody else is gone ,
and we &apos;re stuck here doing this .
eew , this has a really toxic plastic smell .
give me that .
max , are you huffing a ketchup bottle ?
i &apos;m hoping it kills the brain cells that &apos;ll remember
i &apos;m stuck doing ketchups on a friday night .
max , give it to me !
whether you believe it or not , you &apos;re above that .
and you know what ? we &apos;re above this .
forget this . let &apos;s go out .
i mean , i &apos;m newly single , and you &apos;re not picky .
true .
i &apos;m ready to let my hair down
and have one of those crazy
yet fiscally responsible kind of nights .
you mean steal other girls &apos; drinks
when they go to the bathroom ?
seriously , what can you do in williamsburg
if you have less than $ 20 ?
hang out on the sidewalk and look good till you turn 35 .
then turn to your friends and say , &quot; i have to move home . &quot;
hey , you know what ?
the raveonettes are playing the lorimer lounge .
we got a little tip money and lot of deez .
so let &apos;s just watch the magic unfold .
i haven &apos;t seen the raveonettes live
since i saw them in denmark .
that is crazy because i first heard of them
when i was dry @-@ humping a guy named mark in his den ,
so ... twinsies !
wow , my life has really changed .
the last time i was in an alley behind a club ,
i was in an suv with one of the olsen twins .
i still don &apos;t know which one .
身材偏矮
hey , speaking of the olsen twins ,
i once woke up next to a garden gnome .
well , so much for our plan .
yes , we &apos;ve still got &quot; doze , &quot; but no tickets .
there &apos;s gotta be a way for us to get in .
what up , ladies ?
hi . moo . whatever .
you need tickets ?
well , bessie , we might be interested .
how much ?
you can have &apos; em for free if the blonde one milks me .
how bad do you want those tickets , caroline ?
ha , not that bad .
bye . moo . whatever .
sorry , max , but i can &apos;t come back
from pulling a strange man &apos;s teats .
you think that ,
and then you do it , and it &apos;s not so bad .
wow , new york without money is like no magic .
there &apos;s magic all over the city with or without money .
you just have to make your own .
by drinking .
oh . purse beer .
sorry there &apos;s no purse nachos .
i ate them all .
best i can do is , uh ,
the cheese dust down near the birth control .
okay , this is ratchet .
we &apos;re just standing here like a couple of beckys .
where &apos;s your magic now ?
oh , you wanna see magic ?
abracadabra .
let me in , dumbos .
abra @-@ ca @-@ damn @-@ dabra !
you know , i don &apos;t know what that trash bin said to you ,
but you make a cute couple .
i think it &apos;d be a shame to break up
before you got to see what your kids would look like .
well , it &apos;s been a rough couple of years for us ,
what with me considering grad school
and him being a trash can , but what can i say ?
it &apos;s love .
i understand .
americans love their garbage .
how else would you explain
the real housewives of everything ?
真实主妇生活系列节目

hey , ratchet @-@ ass becky , we &apos;re in .
earl , i &apos;m worried .
i haven &apos;t seen max since she left with that guy last night .
i &apos;ve called her a million times .
she picked up once ,
and she was either having sex or fighting a bear .
don &apos;t you worry . max can take care of herself .
i once saw her push a truck out of her way with her mind .
hey , everybody .
hey . pardon .
pardon my appearance ,
but i was just in the park
running after the high school boys &apos; track team .
i told her it was fine with me .
i know she will never catch one of them .
oh , says you .

it makes me wanna xana @-@ do you .
女主的穿着就类似这样
&apos;sup ?
pip @-@ pip and cheerio .
max , thank god . i was so worried .

probably the new shades i didn &apos;t pay for .
or the hours of him going downton on my abbey .
hold up . no spoilers .
i haven &apos;t started season three yet .
earl , you watch that show ?
yes , i do .
i enjoy any show where the help is white .
so you slept with that guy ?
oh , i really slept with that guy .
you go , girl .
don &apos;t stop till you get enough !
i &apos;m surprised you spent the night .
don &apos;t you usually leave before they realize
there &apos;s nothing in their wallet ?
last night you were complaining about no magic .
then i woke up this morning to a view of the park
and hot cinnamon rolls .
now i &apos;m back at the diner but full of cinnamon rolls .
boom . magic . suck it , david blaine .
well , at least you had fun . the only fun i had last night
was when that cow dude passed out on his feet ,
and i tipped him over .
so are you gonna see him again ?
sunday .
and i realize you haven &apos;t heard these words
since you lost your money , but you &apos;re invited .
so you &apos;re asking me to be the third wheel
on a two @-@ night one @-@ night stand ?
so i guess a private plane and two tickets
to the grammys in l.a. won &apos;t do it for you either ?
&apos;cause , bitch , we &apos;re invited !
the grammys ? that &apos;s so exciting .
oh , and my self @-@ esteem could really use
being mistaken for taylor swift right now .
换过无数任名人男友 分手后写歌说是非 因此声名狼藉

you speak french very well .
bravo ! &lt; / i &gt;
normalement , les gens ont les mots , mais avec un accent terrible . &lt; / i &gt;
mais avec vous , c &apos;est comme si je parlais avec ma soeur . &lt; / i &gt;
oh ! je ne sais pas si je parle aussi bien que votre soeur . &lt; / i &gt;
mais je parle mieux que la majorite des americains &lt; / i &gt;
qui pense que le fracais est ... &lt; / i &gt;
&quot; le french fry . &quot; &lt; / i &gt;
that &apos;s all i know .
and every time you ice me out with her ,
that &apos;s what &apos;s coming your way .
okay , so how does this work ?
do we need tickets ? where do i sit ?
because i don &apos;t wanna embarrass myself
in front of french stewart .
max , there are no seat assignments .
you can sit anywhere .
oh , cool . like a.a.
i love a g5 .
this reminds me so much of the plane we used to have .
wait , max , this plane looks very familiar .
max , this was my plane .
well , it &apos;s my plane now .
wait , if this was my plane ...
which it isn &apos;t .
there &apos;d be something i hid down here for an emergency .
money ? gold ? kettle corn ?
yep . my chanel lip gloss .
abra @-@ ca @-@ damn @-@ dabra .
you were a billionaire ,
and for an emergency , you hid lip gloss ?
just in case something went wrong .
i wanted to look good if i was going down .
you know they don &apos;t care what you look like
as long as you go down .
what the hell is wrong with me ?
i &apos;m glossing like a rich gal .
this has gotta last me two years .
would you like a towel ?
how much ?
max , they &apos;re free .
oh , like the doughnuts at a.a.
jeez , that &apos;s hot !
you should warn a bitch .
so sorry . it &apos;s her first time on a plane .
every time .
we only are waiting for one more passenger ,
and then we &apos;ll be departing .
champagne ?
&lt; i &gt; merci beaucoup . &lt; / i &gt;
ooh , the last time i had champagne
was at a filipino wedding i crashed at a doubletree .
another passenger ? i wonder who it could be .
probably my mother .
every time something great is about to happen to me ,
she shows up and ruins it .
in 20 hours , we went from beer in an alley
to dom on a plane .
that &apos;s pretty magical .
yeah , this could not get any better .
max , it did just get better .
that &apos;s 2 chainz . i can &apos;t believe it .
good morning . how y &apos;all doing ?
cool . cool .
all right .
monsieur deux chainz , good morning .
coffee , water , champagne ?

&quot; sleepy time tea &quot; ?
that is so gangster !
oh , we &apos;re moving .
max , buckle your seat belt . we &apos;re about to take off .
i &apos;m a little scared .
what &apos;s it gonna feel like ?
oh , that &apos;s it ? that feels familiar .
guess i have a private plane in my nightstand .
i can &apos;t believe this .
i &apos;m standing in a flying living room eating ham .
that &apos;s prosciutto from italy .
it &apos;s ham from right over there .
and i &apos;m about to go ham on this ham .
it &apos;s been two hours .
when is 2 chainz gonna wake up ? i want a picture .
you want him to wake up for a picture ?
i &apos;ll handle that .
anything ?
nothing . do it again .
wow , that sleepy time really knocks you out .
he must have two @-@ bagged it .
he &apos;s totally out . let &apos;s just do it .
wait , we &apos;re just gonna take his picture ,
nothing else , right ?
yes .
okay , &apos; cause i can see how these things can get out of hand .
okay , i &apos;m first .
no , no , no , i &apos;m first .
it &apos;s my plane .
well , actually it &apos;s my plane .
was your plane . it &apos;s mine now .
i had morning sex for it with a leg cramp .
wait , do another , do another .
good one .
new facebook default .
in fact , this is my new default pic for everything
including my tombstone .
since you did boobs , i &apos;m gonna put my booty in his face ,
&apos;cause all he wants for his birthday is a big booty ho .
closer . i can &apos;t get both of you .
get closer .
i never get tired of waking up like this .
oh , mr. chainz , i am so mortified .
i didn &apos;t wanna bother you . i was just gonna be cool .
oh , that ship sailed with the butt pic
and then crashed with &quot; mr. chainz . &quot;
i just wanted a picture because i am such a huge fan .
and i wanted to wish you luck tonight at the grammys
because your music means a lot to me .
and i totally related when you said
* when i die bury me inside the gucci store *
true .
* when i die bury me inside the louis store *
* all i want for my birthday is a big booty ho *
* all i want for my birthday is a big booty ho *
yeah .
hey , what &apos;s the party , players ?
i heard &quot; booty &quot; and i heard &quot; ho , &quot;
so i had to do a pop @-@ in .
always some weird white guy coming to crash a party .
chainz .
stop . no way .
i can &apos;t believe it &apos;s you flying this plane .
caroline , it &apos;s been so long since i &apos;ve seen you .
bring it in .
oh , max , this is bill .
the pilot .
the pilot ?
why is he walking around ?
brace for crash ! brace for crash !
it &apos;s okay , it &apos;s on autopilot .
autopilot . that &apos;s how i live my life .
pilot bill is an old pal .
he used to fly my friends and i around in college .
yeah , good times .
this is my friend , max ,
and it &apos;s her very first time on an airplane .
hey , mine too .
j.k.
listen , max , why don &apos;t you take a stroll down there
and check out the cockpit ?
the cockpit ?
if it &apos;s anything like the gay bar on 14th street ,
i &apos;m not dressed right .
it is so good to see you .
and , god , i &apos;d forgotten how beautiful you are .
oh , thank you , pilot bill .
you know , i never thought i had a chance with you before
because you had so much money and i was 20 years older ,
but now you &apos;re broke and i had a facelift ,
so we &apos;re kinda on the same level .
oh , a facelift ?
that &apos;s why your face is so tight and pink ?
i thought maybe you were in a fire .
but you look good .
sure , let &apos;s go out .
great .
i &apos;m gonna grab a coffee . i &apos;ll be right back .
what you doing going out with a guy like that ?
well , here &apos;s the thing , 2 .
you don &apos;t tell the pilot flying the plane you &apos;re on
that you don &apos;t wanna go out with him .
got you .
you just keep flirting with him until we land .
i gotta make it to the grammys .
so , max , you &apos;ve really never been on a plane before ?
well , technically it &apos;s my second time
if you count rock @-@ o @-@ plane ride at the carnival .
guess i was rockin &apos; that plane too hard ,
&apos;cause halfway through the ride ,
my mini @-@ 747 fell off its gears ,
and i crashed to the ground .
there would have been a lawsuit ,
but the carnie paid me off with a snow cone ,
and also no one cared about me as a child .
well , go ahead , put your hands on the wheel .
give it a spin .
no , i &apos;m good .
wow , we are really up there .
i have never been this high .
and trust me , i have been high .
yeah , i hear that .
no one liked to get high more than me .
i did everything @-@ pills , weed , coke ,
and what &apos;s that called when you crumble the coke on your weed ?
anyway , i loved to get high .
but that &apos;s all way behind me now .
i &apos;ve been clean and sober
ever since that denzel flight movie came out .
it &apos;s still in the theaters .
yep , saw it last week .
maybe i will put my hands on the wheel .
you know , just in case .
it &apos;s the carnival ride all over again !
i broke the plane ! i broke the plane !
okay , everything &apos;s under control .
just sit down , sit down . put your seat belt on .
and , uh , caroline , here &apos;s my cellular .
of course , you can always still get me at my mom &apos;s , so--
go save the plane !
yeah . yeah .
we &apos;ll be fine .
i was not meant to die as the second banana
in a cross @-@ country booty call .
mon dieu mon dieu ! &lt; / i &gt;
mais pourquoi ca m &apos;arrive maintenant &lt; / i &gt;
jusque quand je rencontre ... &lt; / i &gt;
c &apos;est pas vrai ! oh la la ! &lt; / i &gt;
what did she say ?
i have no idea .
i heard &quot; love &quot; and &quot; why now ? &quot;
so just in case .
i should tell you i took $ 10 out of the cupcake fund
for a big mac and never told you .
i should tell you i took $ 100 out of the cupcake fund
to keep my hair this naturally blonde .
okay , everybody . we got a bit of a situation .
looks like my new girlfriend &apos;s friend broke the plane .
no , i &apos;m just kidding . we had some engine trouble .
we &apos;re going to have to make an emergency landing in kansas .
go , chiefs !
hey , blondie .
why don &apos;t you keep us in the air ?
how about you go give the pilot a little love ?
okay . okay , thank you .
well , good news .
we &apos;re not stranded here .
i just got off the phone ,
and according to my new boyfriend , captain facelift ,
your new boyfriend , the brit ,
is flying us home tomorrow on a commercial flight .
coach .
what ?
i don &apos;t do coach .
and i am pretty positive
2 chainz would have taken us on that other plane they sent
if you hadn &apos;t rapped for 30 minutes
in that corn field after we landed .
i don &apos;t care what you say .
i burned that corn field up .
here , let &apos;s eat something . they delivered the food .
slim jims , cheez @-@ its , pizza pringles ,
and two ham and cheese sandwiches .
ham ? where &apos;s the prosciutto ?
there is none .
&lt; i &gt; mais pourquoi ? &lt; / i &gt;
because we &apos;re at a motel in kansas .
and the lady at the front desk called me a snob
for ordering the pizza pringles .
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m not at the grammys ,
and i &apos;m stuck here eating a lousy vending machine sandwich .
well , it &apos;s better than doing those ketchups in the diner .
and crash @-@ landing in a corn field with a rap star
with our heads still attached-
that &apos;s pretty magical , right ?
yeah , and 2 chainz did say
he enjoyed meeting us and that we &apos;re two fine , big booty hos .
that &apos;s pretty magical .
han &apos;s gonna be so jealous
when he finds out i met our boy .
oh , my god , we forgot to get han &apos;s t @-@ shirt signed .
or did we ?
when you don &apos;t have enough money to fix your own mistakes ,
you &apos;ve gotta make your own magic .
max , it &apos;s 2 chainz with a &quot; z &quot; not an &quot; s . &quot;
damn ! the one time i know how to spell something ,
and it comes back to bite me in the ass .
ooh , it &apos;s starting .
ready to go to the grammys ?
don &apos;t get any ham on the dress .
we have to return these to get our money back .
you think beyonce &apos;s saying that right now ?
hey , if we can make our own magic ,
we can make our own grammys .
max black , who are you wearing ?
who are you wearing ?
my roommate &apos;s rent .
you &apos;re right , this is pretty magical .
but wait , i think it can get better .
see ?
way more magical .
you know , this kind of feels like the private plane .
yeah , the one i have in my nightstand .
