i &apos;m leaving you , harvey .
you can &apos;t just quit .
i &apos;m not quitting .
i &apos;m going to work for louis .
your sleepless nights aren &apos;t going to stop
until you accept the fact
that your secretary isn &apos;t coming back .
and i told you they &apos;ll stop when she does .
this is my formal notice , but i have no intention
of leaving you high and dry , so let &apos;s talk about
finding you someone in the next two weeks .
do you know what &apos;s best for me ?
ripping the band @-@ aid off .
harvey--
so why don &apos;t you clean out your desk
and walk yourself over to louis ?
hey , harvey , if there are any hard feelings with donna--
no , louis , no hard feelings .
okay , but i just want to say if there were--
i said there &apos;s no hard feelings .
jack soloff has been going around the firm
saying you &apos;re never gonna save that company .
since when do you care so much about what jack soloff says ?
since he &apos;s a senior partner with ambition .
i called your father today .
rachel elizabeth zane , will you marry me ?
yes .
how come i never get to pick the places we eat ?
because i don &apos;t want chicken nuggets for dinner ,
and you could take a break from them yourself .
i don &apos;t see a little healthy heart
next to this duck liver mousse .
very funny . i got mike to try it .
i can &apos;t help it if the man is whipped .
speaking of which , let me see that ring
your mother keeps talking about .
okay . i guess he knows what he &apos;s doing .
well , he &apos;s marrying me , so obviously .
while we &apos;re on the topic ...
this is a prenup .
yeah . i had tom draw it up .
it &apos;s actually a standard boilerplate--
i don &apos;t wanna start my marriage
planning how it &apos;s going to end .
rachel , that is not what a prenup is for ,
and you know that .
it &apos;s to isolate assets in order to protect yourself .
i don &apos;t have assets to protect .
yes , you do .
right .
you &apos;re talking about your money .
i haven &apos;t taken a dime from you
since the day i graduated from college .
yeah , maybe not ,
but one day you &apos;re gonna get everything i have .
dad--
rachel , marriages end all the time ,
and i just want to make sure that you &apos;re taken care of ,
if something goes wrong between you and mike .
if something goes wrong between me and mike ,
i will be taken care of , because mike wouldn &apos;t--
you don &apos;t know that .
you don &apos;t know mike .
you &apos;re right , i don &apos;t , which is why i had that drawn up ,
and the least you could do is take it home and look it over .
fine .
now , can we enjoy the rest of our dinner together ?
we can try .
big mike .
it &apos;s been too long .
too long .
guess we &apos;re just too busy
being kickass associates at kickass law firms .
i don &apos;t know about you , but some days i kick ass ...
and some days ...
you get your ass kicked .
okay , mike , so what is this big news ?
you the fastest person ever to make it to junior partner ?
better . i got engaged .
no shit .
yes shit .
well , what country is she from ?
what are you talking about ?
well , i &apos;m assuming she &apos;s a mail @-@ order bride .
okay .
it &apos;s rachel zane .
damn .
mm @-@ hmm .
congratulations , bro .
seriously , you hit the jackpot with that one .
thank you , jimmy .
wait--wait a second , does harold know ?
no , that &apos;s why i brought you guys down here .
okay . you do know he has a huge crush on her , right ?
how huge ?
mike , come on .
we &apos;re talking about harold here . what do you think ?
oh , shit .
hey , bros , what &apos;s the haps ?
hey .
hey .
i will tell you the haps , harold .
do you remember rachel zane ?
uh , yeah , of course .
i still check her facebook page , like , ten times a day .
why ? did something bad happen to her ?
well , if i was her , i would think it was bad .
in fact , i &apos;d think it really sucked .
rachel and i got engaged .
oh , that &apos;s amazing .
i am so happy for you , man . wow .
really ? &apos; cause you sure don &apos;t look happy .
hey , jimmy , why don &apos;t you go get harold a drink ?
why don &apos;t i don &apos;t ?
wait a second , mike .
do you remember that time when i walked in on you
and donna paulsen in the file room ,
and she was on her knees ?
let &apos;s be honest , we all know what was going on there .
does rachel know about that ?
not only does she know , she &apos;s totally fine with it .
oh , my god .
you are the luckiest man in the entire freaking world .
i know . i know .
pissing me off . i need my waitress .
i need a mai tai .
yeah , go get her .
mai tai ? he needs some sex from a woman .
i don &apos;t suppose one of those would be for me .
i don &apos;t think you &apos;d want it if it was .
louis likes six sugars .
of course he does .
i hear you &apos;re interviewing replacements this morning .
i am .
jack soloff .
what brings you to my neck of the woods ?
you do .
oh , does this have anything to do
with jessica not being at the partners meeting tomorrow ?
it sure does .
oh , well , then i &apos;m way ahead of you . she doesn &apos;t get it .
we need ventilation in the men &apos;s bathroom .
i was in there after neil sweetzer this morning ,
and my eyes , they nearly melted off my face .
that is a problem .
not why i &apos;m here .
i &apos;d like to alter the firm &apos;s compensation formula .
okay , jack , look , i know that
you &apos;re the new head of the compensation committee ,
but i don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea .
salaries should be
weighted more towards billables than contingent compensation .
what do you think about that ?
i think that affects harvey &apos;s salary more than anyone else &apos;s .
would it ?
hadn &apos;t realized .
bullshit .
you &apos;re using your position to take on harvey .
hey , you don &apos;t make a name for yourself taking on nobody .
would you rather it be you ?
you threatening me ?
why would i do that ?
louis , you &apos;re a name partner . got there by being a grinder .
it &apos;s only fair that the grinders of this firm
got a bigger piece of the pie .
on top of that , jessica &apos;s not gonna be
at the meeting tomorrow .
timing couldn &apos;t be better .
you know what ? bring it up .
thank you , louis .
what was that ?
what was what ?
that .
that was jack soloff wanting to run his proposal by me .
yeah . a bullshit proposal designed to cut harvey &apos;s salary .
you &apos;re picking a fight with him .
no , i &apos;m not .
i &apos;m letting him bring up his proposal at the meeting ,
so i can smack it down .
why would you do that ?
because i saw the look on harvey &apos;s face .
he &apos;s jealous of us ,
and i want the chance to back him publicly .
louis , harvey might be upset about us ,
but encouraging people to go after him
just so you can have his back is a huge mistake .
you were at millstein swain for seven years .
when ellen swain retired , i decided it was time to move on .
why not go to another partner in the firm ?
because i didn &apos;t think any of the other partners
were good enough .
i appreciate the honesty .
and i appreciate being the first person you called in ,
and if you &apos;re as good at reading people as they say ,
i &apos;ll also be the last .
is that a fact ?
call anyone you want .
i &apos;m the deion sanders of legal secretaries .
deion sanders ?
i &apos;m quick on my feet .
i know how to intercept a problem .
yeah , but deion sanders ?
if you prefer another era , dick butkus .
either way , no one gets by me .
you don &apos;t look like dick butkus .
no , i don &apos;t .
well , thanks , abigail . i &apos;ll be in touch .
you .
how long have you been a legal secretary ?
24 years this spring .
you good at what you do ?
i &apos;m great at what i do .
then you start tomorrow .
well , what do you think ?
size 12 ?
you know it .
then i think they &apos;re awesome .
you didn &apos;t come all the way down here
to give me your new shoe .
and i &apos;m telling you for the hundredth time ,
michael is not leaving nike .
and for the first time , i &apos;m not here about michael .
adidas just made me an offer for $ 100 million .
adidas can go to hell .
that &apos;s 1 / 3 of what your company &apos;s worth .
harvey , i want to take it .
what ?
i &apos;m not letting you do that .
i &apos;m not asking for your permission .
and i don &apos;t give a shit-- i &apos;m not letting you sell
your company for pennies on the dollar .
where the hell is this coming from ?
it &apos;s coming from the fact that life is short ,
i &apos;m burnt out , and i &apos;m ready to move on .
life is short ?
that &apos;s your reason for not thinking this through ?
i don &apos;t want to think it through .
i might change my mind and not do it at all .
okay , teddy , you want to sell ?
sell , but we built this company from the ground up .
give me a week to get you a better offer .
i &apos;ll give you the same thing they &apos;re giving me .
48 hours .
then i &apos;ll take it .
by the way , where &apos;s donna ?
she moved on .
you see ?
that &apos;s what i &apos;m talking about .
life is short .
donna moved on to something better .
she didn &apos;t move on to something better .
what do you mean ?
she &apos;s working for louis .
litt ? what the hell happened ?
nothing happened .
just time for a change .
if she &apos;s working for that asshole , something happened .
teddy , you say you know when it &apos;s time to move on ,
it &apos;s time to move on from this topic right now .
okay , harvey .
all i &apos;m saying is mrs. keebler out there ain &apos;t no donna .
twice in two days ?
people are gonna get the wrong idea .
well , they can think what they &apos;re gonna think ,
but it &apos;s not going to stop me from giving my boy
an engagement gift .
you &apos;re giving me a case ?
it &apos;s not just any case .
this is right up your alley . do @-@ gooder lane .
all right .
listen , mike .
these people got the shaft for one reason .
they &apos;re poor , and no one gives a shit about &apos; em .
they need a hero , and you &apos;re that guy .
why aren &apos;t you that guy ?
oh , i am that guy ,
but you &apos;re the one getting married to rachel zane .
the same rachel zane that i almost got fired ,
and then you gave me a second chance .
so this is your way of making it up to me ?
listen , mike , talk to the plaintiffs ,
listen to their stories , and i promise you
it &apos;ll break your little bleeding heart .
thank you , jimmy .
yeah , you bet .
what if i can &apos;t get jessica to sign off ?
then i &apos;ll just take the case back
and get you a decanter or some shit .
so it &apos;s unanimous .
from now on , all first @-@ years are required
to bill 2,800 hours
and bring their own lunches .
congratulations , louis ,
another generation of associates smacked into submission .
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
i think i &apos;m done with this meeting .
harvey , please , we still have new business .
speaking of which , i &apos;d like to propose a change
to the current compensation formula .
excuse me ?
well , since taking over the committee ,
i &apos;ve been evaluating pay structures ,
and i think it &apos;s high time that this firm
put a larger emphasis on billable hours .
why don &apos;t you stick to the 48th floor , jack ?
i take it you have a problem with my proposal .
you &apos;re damn right i do .
i just took on the sale of a man &apos;s company ,
and my entire fee is contingent @-@ based .
because you operate as your own entity ,
while the rest of us are members of a team known as this firm .
no , because i bring in
a truckload of money for this firm .
well , like i said , special rules for harvey specter .
you know what , jack ? that &apos;s enough .
the current system works fine ,
and i don &apos;t appreciate you speaking to harvey
in such a disrespectful manner .
are you shitting me ?
harvey , i &apos;m sorry .
save your sorries , louis . this meeting &apos;s over .
harvey , listen . i &apos;m on your side .
yeah . i don &apos;t need you on my side , okay ?
i have shit to do .
wait .
i haven &apos;t even brought up my proposal yet
for the men &apos;s bathroom .
you want to finish being king for a day ?
be my guest .
enjoy your coffee and your 50 sugars ,
and go for it , but like i said , i have shit to do .
stanley was a good man .
never missed a day of work ,
provided for his family .
he didn &apos;t deserve what happened to him .
what did happen ?
like i told the other lawyer ,
he went to the hospital with chest pains .
they said it was nothing .
he kept complaining .
stanley never complained .
two days later they released him .
stanley went to sleep in our bed that night .
and he never woke up .
no .
he didn &apos;t .
are you sure the hospital released him
because the insurance company cut his stay ?
he was sick , mr. ross ,
and they just sent him home .
there are over 200 other people
who had the exact same thing happen to them .
you think that &apos;s a coincidence ?
no , i don &apos;t ,
which is why i &apos;m considering reopening this case .
so what &apos;s stopping you ?
well , for one thing ,
i want to know why your other lawyer dropped out .
because they worked that man to the bone .
he almost lost his entire practice ,
but i was told that you &apos;re with a big , powerful firm .
i am ...
but i don &apos;t know if i &apos;m gonna be able to
get them to sign off on this .
so what are we supposed to do ?
you &apos;re supposed to sit tight .
what the hell was that ?
what are you talking about ?
you know exactly what i &apos;m talking about .
you stormed out of the meeting
that we were supposed to run together .
i didn &apos;t storm out , i walked out
because you were doing a shitty job running it .
what are you talking about ? i had your back .
after you let that clown come after my salary .
i didn &apos;t let him do anything .
i defended you , and then you smack me down ,
after which i had to postpone a presentation
that i was very passionate about .
it &apos;s a bathroom , louis . it smells sometimes .
so why don &apos;t you just go in there ,
do what people do in there , and get out of my face ?
you know what ? donna was right .
i should have never tried to make things right with you .
make things right with me ?
yeah , harvey .
i let jack do that so that i could put him in his place
and show you that i had your back , but you can &apos;t see it
because you &apos;re too damn jealous of me and donna .
what did you just say to me ?
you &apos;re jealous .
you know what , louis ,
if i was so upset about the two of you ,
why am i still paying her salary ?
bullshit . the firm pays her salary .
not all of it .
you see , when i brought her over here from the da &apos;s office ,
jessica wouldn &apos;t hire her because i was an associate ,
so i paid her salary .
and then i made partner ,
and i didn &apos;t think it was enough , so i paid her more .
and again and again and again .
so i &apos;ve had enough of you telling me i &apos;m jealous .
yeah , well , donna doesn &apos;t work for you anymore .
she works for me , and the only person
who &apos;s gonna be taking care of her salary--this guy .
you got that ?
fine by me .
but before you say that ,
you better know what you &apos;re getting yourself into .
oh , yeah , i know what i &apos;m getting myself into ,
because you can &apos;t put a price tag on a woman like that .
i need to talk to you .
let me guess .
you got into a pissing contest with harvey ,
he told you he &apos;s been covering donna &apos;s salary ,
you , out of pride , said that you were going to take it on ,
and now you &apos;re here to find out how much you &apos;re on the hook for .
nothing like that .
oh , good .
then what is it ?
everything you just said .
louis--
jessica , please .
i just want to see the number .
okay , louis .
you want to see the number ? here &apos;s the number .
thank y-- holy goddamn shit .
are you sure you didn &apos;t accidentally add a zero ?
yes , i &apos;m sure .
is there any way the firm can--
the firm is not going to pick this up .
harvey knew that , and he chose to pay her more anyway .
what the hell am i supposed to do ?
well , it seems to me you have two options :
you can tell donna that harvey &apos;s been augmenting her salary ,
and you don &apos;t want to do it anymore .
negatory .
or you can pay it yourself .
not happening .
there is a third option .
i can send her back to harvey .
how dare you ?
what do you mean i &apos;m not liquid ?
who told you to only save 10 % cash ?
well , i don &apos;t care what i said .
does my podiatrist listen to me
when i tell him i have hammertoe ?
is everything okay , louis ?
everything &apos;s wonderful .
okay .
actually , it occurred to me
that we have not discussed a very important subject .
what is it ?
donna , money &apos;s a very sensitive issue .
and i think you should be fairly compensated .
i mean , i know how hard it was for you to leave harvey for me ,
and i am forever grateful .
it &apos;s just that i--
louis , shh .
i don &apos;t need a huge raise .
the standard 2 % is more than enough .
2 % ?
yes .
you have a huge heart ,
but i already make more than every other secretary
at the firm , so--
2 % it is .
thanks , louis .
don &apos;t mention it .
hey , do you have a second ?
i need your legal advice about something .
yeah , of course . what is it ?
my fiance left this prenup in the kitchen .
i &apos;m just wondering if you think i should sign it .
mike , it &apos;s not what it looks like .
it looks like your father had a prenup prepared
for you to make me sign .
then it &apos;s exactly what it looks like .
and i &apos;m guessing you don &apos;t want me to sign it ?
no , i don &apos;t ,
because he &apos;s been trying to control me my entire life ,
and i &apos;m not gonna let him do that with this .
has it occurred to you
that maybe your father is only doing this because he loves you ?
i don &apos;t really care why he &apos;s doing it .
great marriages don &apos;t start with contracts .
i know that .
then why are you grilling me ?
because there &apos;s a reason that you didn &apos;t tell me about this ,
and i need to know what it is .
my dad said he doesn &apos;t know the man
that i &apos;m choosing to marry ,
and i just--
i didn &apos;t want to tell you that .
well , i found out anyway .
yeah .
rachel , in the future ,
i want you to feel comfortable
telling me this stuff in the first place .
i will .
mr. specter , i wanted to--
you &apos;re still here ?
i don &apos;t leave until you leave .
well , in that case , what time is my meeting with adidas ?
11 : 15 .
i moved your 11 : 00 to 3 : 00
and your 3 : 00 to 5 : 00 .
did you line up--
buyers ?
i did but not for another week .
nike and puma are overseas ,
and you said reebok didn &apos;t matter
if the other two can &apos;t be there .
god damn it .
there &apos;s one more thing .
what difference does it make ?
i can &apos;t delay the sale if i don &apos;t know
why my client is dumping his company on a whim .
that &apos;s the one more thing .
mr. doyle &apos;s best friend died
a month ago of pancreatic cancer .
he was 46 .
how &apos;d you know that ?
something he said to you just before
he started talking shit about me
stuck in my head .
what exactly was that ?
when people say &quot; life is short &quot; two times in 30 seconds ,
it &apos;s usually right after somebody died .
i take it you were listening to our conversation .
that &apos;s what good secretaries do .
sorry about the keebler thing .
you didn &apos;t say it .
besides , it doesn &apos;t take albert einstein to figure out
why you hired somebody that look like me
to replace somebody that look like her .
listen , gretchen , i--
you don &apos;t have to worry about that with me .
i prefer my men manly .
am i not manly ?
well , if you have to ask ...
mike , how you doing ?
robert .
what can i do for you ?
i heard you wanted me to sign a prenup .
i did .
i hope you didn &apos;t take it personally .
of course not , i &apos;m happy to sign it ,
but rachel did say that you don &apos;t know
what kind of guy i am ,
so i thought i &apos;d come here to show you that
this is the kind of guy i am .
you &apos;re going after kelton insurance ?
it &apos;s not about who i &apos;m going after .
it &apos;s about who i &apos;m representing .
i &apos;m putting my ass on the line for 200 people
who have no one to fight for them other than me ,
so if you &apos;re worried that i &apos;d go after rachel &apos;s money
if something went wrong--
you &apos;re not that type of guy .
no , i &apos;m not .
i respect that .
thank you , sir .
but let me tell you something .
i used to be one of those people ,
and i scratched and clawed my way to where i am today ,
which is why i know
when you come from nothing and you make yourself into something ,
you &apos;re always waiting for the day
they &apos;re gonna come and take it away .
i &apos;m telling you that i come from nothing ,
and i would never do that .
i &apos;m not saying you &apos;re gonna take it .
i &apos;m saying you might do something
that makes someone else take it .
what do you mean ?
you &apos;re learning at the feet of harvey specter
and jessica pearson ,
and they know something i know .
you &apos;re gonna be a great lawyer .
you &apos;re gonna crack some eggs ,
and you never know when someone &apos;s gonna come at you
to take what &apos;s yours for something you did .
robert , i would never--
let me finish .
i &apos;m telling you this because you &apos;re gonna be family .
you might not have crossed any lines yet , but you will .
i &apos;m just trying to protect my baby girl .
jessica , you wanted to see me ?
actually , louis wants to see both of us .
then let &apos;s get it over with .
okay .
i would like to propose
a revamping of the pay structure
under the following guidelines .
we increase the percentage of billables the partners get .
we decrease the percentage of contingent fees
by an offsetting amount .
what ?
that &apos;s what jack soloff said yesterday .
no , this is different .
i &apos;ve capped the amount it affects any one partner .
you got to be shitting me .
i know you &apos;re wondering why i &apos;m proposing this .
it &apos;s crystal clear why you &apos;re proposing it .
you get the exact amount to cover donna &apos;s salary ,
and you take it out of my paycheck .
louis--
this has nothing to do with that .
jack had a great idea .
it just needed some fine @-@ tuning .
fine @-@ tuning ? you &apos;re the one that said
you only let him bring it up
so that you can smack it down .
is that true ?
yes . maybe , but i had some time to think about it .
jack put something on the table ,
and it &apos;s our duty to follow through on it .
oh , bullshit--you &apos;re only following through on it
because you &apos;re a cheap son of a bitch .
harvey .
i don &apos;t want to hear it , jessica .
yesterday , he accused me of being jealous .
today , he &apos;s coming after my money .
no , i &apos;m not--
shut up .
we both know donna going to work for you
has nothing to do with you .
you got lucky .
lucky ?
like a monkey who won the lottery ,
so the least you can do is be a man , pay her yourself ,
or suck it up and tell her the truth .
all right . that &apos;s enough . we &apos;re not doing this .
i am a name partner .
louis .
no . he has no right to--
i will slap the taste out of your mouth .
thanks , jessica .
i appreciate you being on the same page .
oh , we &apos;re not on the same page .
what are you talking about ?
i wanted the two of you to run that meeting yesterday
to see if you were okay with each other , but you &apos;re not .
he may be cheap , but he &apos;s right .
you are taking your donna anger out on him ,
and it needs to stop .
i don &apos;t have donna anger .
oh , like hell you don &apos;t .
and if you don &apos;t admit that to yourself ,
i &apos;ll slap the taste out of your mouth too .
what you working on there , mike ?
um , nothing . just some cleanup .
what can i do for you , jessica ?
you can tell me why you reopened a case
against a major insurance company
we were never a part of to start with .
um , i reopened it
because i looked at it and it &apos;s a winner .
well , i also looked at it ,
and i say it &apos;s a loser .
jessica , look--
you took a case on contingency
where every plaintiff is dirt poor ,
which means , even if we win ,
compensation for lost wages is nothing .
you &apos;re leaving out punitive damages ,
and harvey takes cases on contingency all the time .
yeah , he takes them to make money ,
not to save kittens in trees .
and i just told you this is going to make money .
and that &apos;s what you said about liberty rail ,
and instead of making money ,
it almost ended with donna behind bars .
no one is going to jail for this .
no , they &apos;re not , because it &apos;s going to cost a fortune to fund ,
and i &apos;m not laying out that kind of money on a long shot .
jessica , look . i promised myself that i--
i don &apos;t care who you promised .
you took this case without running it by me ,
and you did it because you knew i &apos;d say no .
jessica--
so that &apos;s enough .
dump it , or i will .
i need to talk to you .
really ?
&apos;cause the last time you talked to me ,
you told me to open my mouth , and you slammed it shut .
because you wanted to go after harvey , but now i &apos;m on board .
why should i believe you ?
answer me this .
how many partners do you have in your pocket ,
if we put your proposal to a vote ?
i can get 45 % .
well , then the reason you can believe me
is that i &apos;m gonna get you the difference .
how you gonna do that if you don &apos;t have the courage
to back my plan at your own meeting ?
by showing everyone at this firm exactly
what harvey makes .
now i know you &apos;re bullshitting me .
you &apos;d be fired if you did that .
not if i do it by accident .
can you believe that sneaker brings in
over a billion dollars from china alone ?
with earnings like that , makes me wonder
why you &apos;re trying to rip off my client .
buying a man &apos;s company for a fair price
is hardly ripping him off .
but it &apos;s not a fair price .
you gave my client 48 hours to take your offer .
i &apos;m gonna give you five minutes to take mine .
double your money , or i walk out the door .
that &apos;s ridiculous .
what &apos;s ridiculous is you preying on a man
who just lost his lifelong friend .
i &apos;m a businessman , not a grief counselor .
then let me counsel you on this .
because he &apos;s grieving , i have the ability
to go to the board and delay this sale .
but you &apos;re not going to , because you know
it &apos;ll drive down the price even more
when he eventually wants to sell anyway .
you &apos;re right , it will ,
but i &apos;ll tell you what , mr. polk ,
it &apos;ll still be worth more than your offer .
and after my client &apos;s grief passes ,
he may still want to sell ,
but it sure as hell won &apos;t be to you .
i got to call you back .
how the hell did you get in here ?
i fired your assistant ten minutes after i fired you .
guess amy still knows how to get a person through .
congratulations .
you made your way in . you can make your way out .
not before i give you the chance to make $ 20 million .
what makes you think i want to get in the business
of underwriting class @-@ action lawsuits ?
because you &apos;re in the business of making money ,
and before you say no ,
i &apos;m gonna give you 20 % off the top .
it &apos;s the best deal out there .
well , that &apos;s not good enough .
25 % .
are you authorized to do that ?
no , you &apos;re not .
knowing you , you probably don &apos;t even have the authorization
to come to me in the first place .
i came to you because this is our chance to make it right .
bullshit . you need money .
that &apos;s the only reason you &apos;re standing here in front of me .
jonathan , i could have gone anywhere .
i came to you for the same reason i went to walter gillis ,
to make it right .
pick up the phone and ask him .
i &apos;m not walter gillis .
tell amy i said &quot; thank you &quot; for getting you past security ,
&apos;cause now i &apos;m gonna call every investment banker i know
and tell them to pass on your offer
because mike ross can &apos;t be trusted .
what the hell is this ?
i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
yes , you do . this is harvey &apos;s last three income statements ,
and i found them sitting in the copy machine .
donna , i need you to put that back where you found it ,
and i need you to put it back now .
i won &apos;t do it .
that was not a request .
that was an order .
i don &apos;t care .
i &apos;m not gonna let you do this .
see ?
i knew that you would jump at the first opportunity
you had to take his side over mine .
this isn &apos;t me taking harvey &apos;s side .
this is me stopping you from making a huge mistake .
and if he did the same thing , you wouldn &apos;t be stopping him .
harvey would never do anything like this ,
and if he did , i sure as hell would .
oh , bullshit .
no , louis .
it &apos;s not bullshit .
you have no idea how many times
i kept him from going overboard with you .
it was half my goddamn job .
well , you know what ?
you didn &apos;t stop him every time ,
and you &apos;re not stopping me this time .
now , give me that thing .
okay . fine . you don &apos;t want to put it back ?
i &apos;ll do it myself .
louis--
no . donna , you know what ?
you came to work for me .
you knew who i was when you did ,
so now it &apos;s time for you to decide .
are you with me or not ?
高级合伙人
while i &apos;m not opposed to unexpected gifts on my desk ,
i do prefer if they &apos;re made of chocolate .
got it .
next time i leave you a signed prenup ,
it will be made of chocolate .
why did you sign it ?
i went to see your dad .
you did what ?
i wanted to show him
what kind of man his daughter was marrying ,
because i wanted him to trust me .
mike , he doesn &apos;t trust anybody , which is exactly why
i &apos;m not interested in his marital advice .
but like you said , i would appreciate it
if in the future ,
you tell me if you &apos;re gonna do something like that .
you &apos;re right , i should have told you before i went over there ,
but for the record , instead of getting him to trust me ,
i ended up trusting him .
mike--
rachel , listen to me .
i know you think that he &apos;s doing this to control you ,
but he thinks he &apos;s doing it to protect you .
and the truth is that i never had a father
who could do something like that for me , so ...
i think that you should try and see where he &apos;s coming from .
what &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s your new offer .
it &apos;s twice the money .
it &apos;s what i do .
and that &apos;s why i pay you so much .
i didn &apos;t do it for the money , teddy .
i did it because you were getting ripped off ,
and i &apos;m not gonna let that happen to you ,
no matter what the circumstances .
you found out .
why didn &apos;t you tell me what happened ?
because i didn &apos;t want you to try and stop me .
you still could have come to me .
and tell you what ?
that my best friend from when we were seven died
out of the blue ?
i hadn &apos;t spoken to him in 20 years ,
because we got into a fight
over some woman whose name i can &apos;t even remember .
and now i don &apos;t give a shit about the sneaker business .
well , i would have understood .
would you have ?
look , harvey ,
i appreciate what you did for me .
if i &apos;m ever back in business , you &apos;ll always be my lawyer .
i &apos;ll always be your friend .
louis , do you have a second ?
oh , i don &apos;t know .
what animal are you gonna call me now ? an iguana ?
i &apos;m not gonna call you anything .
i &apos;m here because i want to put everything behind us .
well , aren &apos;t i lucky ?
louis , please .
you were right .
i was a dick in that meeting and again in the bathroom
and again with jessica .
i said some things that i wish i could take back ,
but we &apos;ve been friends with each other for a long time ,
and i don &apos;t want to throw that away .
you really mean that ?
i do .
come here .
harvey , this is amazing .
i never thought you would come to me and--
oh , shit .
&quot; oh , shit &quot; what ?
i forgot . i have to put a bid on an item on ebay .
what ?
a mongolian ...
praying mantis piano ballet .
good talk . i have to go .
what is that ? you shouldn &apos;t be reading that .
that &apos;s privileged information .
where the hell did you--
oh , shit .
what &apos;s that for ?
it &apos;s a retainer .
i am looking for some legal advice .
i don &apos;t think you can afford me .
it won &apos;t take long . i just want you to take a look at this .
you got mike to sign this ?
my dad did .
then why are you coming to me ?
because you once told me that you have a father
just like mine .
let me guess , you think robert is trying to control you ?
he did manage to construct a situation
where the two most important men in my life
are making decisions about me without me .
you know what i think ?
i think this has nothing to do with your dad ,
and you know it .
mike .
yes . mike .
that &apos;s the real reason why you &apos;re coming to me ,
even though you told yourself it wasn &apos;t .
it could protect me .
it could .
it could also do something else .
undermine my relationship .
believe me .
i learned that one the hard way ,
which means you need to ask yourself ,
how much do you really love mike ?
i love him all the way .
then don &apos;t sign it .
on the house .
and , rachel , as far as your father goes ,
he and i don &apos;t always see eye to eye ,
but i do respect that man .
and if he is anything like my father ,
for all of his faults ,
he would take a bullet
before he &apos;d let anything happen to his little girl .
thank you .
uh , okay .
harold and i ponied up last time
because it was a special occasion ,
but tonight drinks are on you , my friend .
that &apos;s fair .
as much as i appreciate it , jimmy , i got to return the gift .
what ?
yeah .
i can &apos;t take the case .
no , no , no .
what do you mean you can &apos;t take the case ?
jessica won &apos;t lay out the money for the man hours .
okay , then get somebody else to lay out the money .
mike , investment banks are taking stakes
in shit like this now .
you , of all people , should know that .
you think i didn &apos;t try that ?
it didn &apos;t work .
god damn it , mike .
you always said you gave a shit about people .
and you said that i could return this case .
i don &apos;t care what i said .
jimmy ,
what the hell is going on here ?
okay . one of the victims was my uncle keith ,
but i didn &apos;t tell you about him because my cousin came to me
and asked me to make it right ,
and i promised her that i would .
it &apos;s just i don &apos;t have the juice at my firm ,
and i was--
i was too ashamed to tell you .
jimmy--
no , mike , listen .
look , i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t tell you straight up .
but , please , these people need your help .
what can i do for you , jack ?
you can explain to me
how the hell you justify making this much money .
where &apos;d you get this ?
was left in the copy machine .
by who ?
i don &apos;t know .
but now i do know why you pissed
all over my idea at the meeting .
this is confidential .
it was confidential .
now , every senior partner &apos;s seen it ,
and people are furious .
i earn every penny i make .
we &apos;ll see about that .
what are you talking about ?
i just called for a vote tomorrow on my proposal ,
and i hope you &apos;ve been saving your money ,
because your gravy train &apos;s about to leave the station .
so this is why you said , &quot; oh , shit . &quot;
what &apos;s that ?
oh , you know what it is ,
because you &apos;re the one who left it
in the goddamn copier .
oh , my god , harvey , i was making copies
of everyone &apos;s salaries for my records , and i must have--
bullshit , louis .
you did this to come after me ,
and after i apologized , you ran and tried to stop it .
harvey , please , what &apos;s done is done ,
and like you said before , we &apos;re friends .
we can move past this , and we can fight the vote together .
there &apos;s no way i win the vote after people see this .
you want to get past it ? admit what you did .
that &apos;s automatic termination .
then we &apos;ll fight that together .
harvey , i can &apos;t .
louis !
jessica tried to fire me once .
i can &apos;t give her the chance to do that again .
well , you know what ?
it &apos;s gonna happen again ,
because i know what you did .
you know what ? that &apos;s enough .
and you come at me flinging accusations ,
well , you better have proof .
you have proof , harvey ?
yeah , i didn &apos;t think so .
harvey , you don &apos;t get to come to me
at all hours of the night anymore .
i &apos;m here because your new boss--
i know why you &apos;re here .
then you know what he did .
and i need you to admit it ,
so i can block their bullshit vote .
and get louis fired ?
he wouldn &apos;t be in this mess if you &apos;d have just stopped him
from doing this in the first place .
harvey , if i knew louis was gonna do something like this ,
and i &apos;m not saying i did ,
then i would have told him to his face not to .
but if he went ahead and did it anyway ,
then i &apos;m not gonna go behind his back to fix it .
because you always said , &quot; once you pick a side ,
&quot; if you &apos;re not loyal to that side ,
&quot; then who the hell are you ? &quot;
then you should have thought of that
before you picked someone who would do something like this
in the first place .
you want to know what kind of man louis is ?
this whole thing started because he wanted to prove
to you that he had your back ,
because he thought you were jealous of us .
no , this whole thing started
because i told him that i &apos;ve been paying your salary
since we came to the firm ,
and he was too cheap to pay it himself
and too weak to tell you the truth .
and if you &apos;ve kept that from me for 12 years
and you &apos;re only just telling me now , then maybe you are jealous .
mike , how &apos;d you get in ? give you a key already ?
no . laura let me in . she said you &apos;d be back here .
i don &apos;t know why .
i &apos;m trying to find something tasty .
there &apos;s not one damn thing that &apos;s bad for you
in this entire house .
then i guess it &apos;s a good thing i didn &apos;t tell her
that i brought you these .
oh , chicken nuggets .
rachel made them herself .
deep @-@ fried , not baked ?
you &apos;re welcome .
she sign that prenup ?
no , but she sent those because she realized the prenup
was about love , not control .
then i respect her decision .
what changed her mind about me ?
you really want to know ?
mm @-@ hmm .
jessica .
oh , shit . what did she say ?
i got to know that secret .
i don &apos;t know what she said to rachel ,
but i know what she said to me .
so that &apos;s why you &apos;re here .
you know those people that i told you i was fighting for ?
jessica &apos;s not gonna go for it .
i get it .
too much money to lay out for too little payoff .
but you said you came from the same place as these people .
robert , they need someone like you to fight for them ,
and i can &apos;t do it .
so i &apos;m asking you to .
you think this case is a winner ?
i do .
then what do you say we do it together ?
what are you doing here , louis ?
i notice you didn &apos;t come to the vote this morning .
no , i didn &apos;t . i was busy closing a deal for my client .
let me guess . you had &apos; em backdate your sale to yesterday ,
so it falls under your old pay structure ?
no , louis , that &apos;s something you would do ,
because unlike you , i don &apos;t actually care about the money .
you expect me to believe that ?
i don &apos;t care whether you believe it or not .
my compensation package was about recognizing what i do .
money was just a consequence .
that &apos;s why i didn &apos;t mind sharing it with donna .
now , get out .
no .
you did care about the money , because it was the last thing
you had that separated you from me .
excuse me ?
i got name partner .
i got donna , and that drove you nuts .
so you shit on me at the meeting ,
and then you pretended to apologize .
i did apologize , louis .
i came to you like a man ,
and then when i gave you the chance to make it up to me ,
you choked , like you always do .
well , how you like me now ?
because the only thing you had left was that you made more .
and now you don &apos;t , and i win .
you didn &apos;t win anything .
what are you talking about ?
i &apos;m talking about the fact that no matter what you get ,
you &apos;re always wanting more .
and the problem with always wanting more is
that the second you get it , it can always be taken away .
you &apos;re not reversing that vote .
i &apos;m not talking about the vote .
i &apos;m talking about what you value most .
that &apos;s right .
might not happen today or tomorrow ,
but it &apos;s gonna happen , because i &apos;m gonna make it happen .
one day , you &apos;re gonna walk into your office ,
and she &apos;s gonna be gone .
