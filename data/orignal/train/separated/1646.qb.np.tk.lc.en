no , see , the liquid @-@ metal terminators were created
in the future by skynet ,
and skynet was developed by miles dyson ,
but that future no longer exists
due to dyson &apos;s death in terminator 2 .
okay , read only this .
assuming all the good terminators
were originally evil terminators created by skynet
but then reprogrammed by the future john connor ,
why would skynet , an artificial computer intelligence ,
bother to create a petite , hot , 17 @-@ year @-@ old killer robot ?
skynet is kinky ?
i don &apos;t know ...
artificial intelligences do not have teen fetishes .
all right . wait ! they use it to ...
too late . i win .
what the hell is that ?
i don &apos;t know , but if cats could sing ...
they &apos;d hate it , too .
hey , guys !
hi ! where you going ?
what ?
we just had to mail some letters and ...
throw away some chicken .
you &apos;ll never guess what just happened .
oh , i give up .
i don &apos;t guess .
as a scientist , i reach conclusions
based on observation and experimentation ...
although as i &apos;m saying this ,
it occurs to me you may have been employing
a rhetorical device rendering my response moot .
what was that ?
believe it or not , personal growth .
what happened ?
all right , remember when i auditioned for that workshop
production of rent , but i didn &apos;t get it
and i couldn &apos;t figure out why .
i have a conclusion based on an observation .
no , you don &apos;t .
no , he doesn &apos;t .
well , the girl they picked to play mimi--
she dropped out , and they asked me to replace her .
congratulations. what a lucky break .
it &apos;s not that big a deal , just a one @-@ night showcase ,
but they invite a lot of casting people and agents .
so , you never know .
i think i know. no , you don &apos;t .
he doesn &apos;t .
it &apos;s this friday night at 8 : 00. you guys want to come ?
no. no .
because ... uh ...
friday we are attending a symposium
on molecular positronium .
i think that &apos;s a week from tuesday , at 6 : 00 .
no , it &apos;s this friday .
at 8 : 00 .
oh , too bad .
well , i gotta get to rehearsal .
see you guys. see ya .
you just lied to penny .
yes , i did. and you did it
so casually-- no rapid breathing ,
no increase in perspiration ...
so ?
so , lack of a physiological response while lying
is characteristic of a violent sociopath .
sheldon , are you worried about your safety ?
no , i imagine if you were going to kill me ,
you &apos;d have done it a long time ago .
that &apos;s very true .
the big bang theory s01e10
leonard ?
leonard ?
leonard ? what ?
i need to speak to you .
it &apos;s 2 : 00 in the morning !
it &apos;s important .
i highly doubt that .
go away .
are you still out there ?
yes .
what ?
you &apos;re right ; it can wait until morning .
what , what , what , what , what ?
never mind .
i clearly woke you up in the middle of a rem cycle .
you &apos;re in no state of mind to talk .
sheldon , what is it ?
i &apos;m uncomfortable having been included in your lie to penny .
what was i supposed to say ?
you could have told her the truth .
that would have hurt her feelings .
is that a relevant factor ?
yes .
then i suppose you could &apos;ve agreed to go .
and what would i have said afterwards ?
i would suggest something to be a fact of
singing is neither an appropriate vocation
nor avocation for you , and if you disagree ,
i &apos;d recommend you have a cat scan
to look for a tumor pressing
on the cognitive processing centers of your brain .
i couldn &apos;t say that .
i would have to say , &quot; you were terrific
and i can &apos;t wait to hear you sing again . &quot;
why ?
that &apos;s the social protocol .
it &apos;s what you do when you have a friend
who &apos;s proud of something they really suck at .
i was not aware of that .
well , now you are. oh .
all right. leonard ?
yes ?
when we played chess earlier ,
you were terrific , and i can &apos;t wait to play you again .
good night .
leonard ?
leonard ?
leonard ?
this would be so much easier
if i were a violent sociopath .
leonard ? leonard ?
what ?
i was analyzing our lie , and i believe we &apos;re in danger
of penny seeing through the ruse .
how ?
simple , if she were to log onto
click on &quot; upcoming events , &quot; scroll down to &quot; seminars , &quot;
download the pdf schedule ,
and look for the seminar on molecular positronium ,
well than ...
our pants are metaphorically on fire .
well , sir , my trousers will not be igniting today .
penny ?
penny ?
penny ?
good morning .
do you have any idea what time it is ?
of course i do .
my watch is linked to the atomic clock
in boulder , colorado .
it &apos;s accurate to one @-@ tenth of a second .
but as i &apos;m saying this , it occurs to me
that , once again , your question may have been rhetorical .
what do you want ?
remember how leonard told you
we couldn &apos;t come to your performance
because we were attending a symposium
on molecular positronium ?
i remember &quot; symposium . &quot;
yes. well ... he lied .
wait .
what ?
he lied
and i &apos;m feeling very uncomfortable about it .
well , imagine how i &apos;m feeling .
hungry ?
tired ?
i &apos;m sorry , this really isn &apos;t my strong suit .
you told her i lied ?
why would you tell her i lied ?
to help you .
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m not seeing the help .
she was going to see through your lie eventually ,
so i told her that you were lying to protect me .
ohh ... i &apos;m getting a bad feeling .
hunger ?
indigestion ?
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m really not very good at this .
anyway ,
penny now believes that , on friday night ,
we &apos;re going to participate
in my cousin leopold &apos;s drug intervention .
your cousin leopold .
who most people call leo , but he also answers to lee .
remember that. it &apos;s important .
what &apos;s important ?
details , leonard-- the success
or failure of our deceitful enterprise
turns on details .
do you have a cousin leopold ? no .
i made him up .
i think you &apos;d call him lee .
i don &apos;t get it .
i already told her a lie .
why replace it with a different lie ?
well , first of all , your lie was laughably transparent ,
where mine is exquisitely convoluted .
while you were sleeping ,
i was weaving an un @-@ unravelable web .
un @-@ unravelable ?
yes .
if she googles &quot; leopold houston , &quot;
she &apos;ll find a facebook page ,
an online blog depicting his descent into drug use
and a desperate yet hopeful listing on eharmony.com.
okay , why would i go
to a drug intervention for your cousin ?
ah ! because it &apos;s in long beach , and i don &apos;t drive .
we &apos;re going to long beach ?
no , of course not. there &apos;s no cousin leo .
there &apos;s no intervention .
focus , leonard .
aw , come on .
we just leave the house on friday night and we return
in the wee hours , emotionally wrung out ,
from the work of convincing leo to go back into rehab .
he goes back into rehab ?
yes , but , he can relapse if penny
ever invites us to hear her sing again .
you still told her i lied .
for a noble purpose-- to spare me
the social embarrassment
of having a drug @-@ addled first cousin--
which i &apos;m assuming is embarrassing , yes ?
how am i supposed to remember all of this ?
oh , that &apos;s the best part. you don &apos;t have to .
see , i told penny that you would be embarrassed
if you knew that she found out that you had lied ,
so she &apos;s agreed to operate
as if the original lie is still in force .
so she &apos;s expecting me to lie about going
to a symposium in pasadena ,
when , in actuality , we &apos;re pretending
to go to a drug intervention in long beach .
un @-@ unravelable .
oh , hey , penny .
wow , look at you , all ready for your showcase .
you look great. thanks .
i just wanted to come by and wish you guys luck
with your ... symposium .
well , thank you .
you know , i got to tell you , a lot of friends
would let their friend go alone ,
but that &apos;s not who you are .
you are the kind of guy who stands by a friend
when ... when he has a symposium to go to .
i don &apos;t know what to say .
it &apos;s okay , leonard .
oh , okay , all right , good .
oh , boy , group hug. uh @-@ uh .
okay .
so , what &apos;s up ?
well , penny is on her way to perform
in a one @-@ night showcase production of rent ,
which we are unable to attend , because we &apos;re going
to a symposium on molecular positronium
given by dr. emil farmanfarmian .
wait a minute-- farmanfarmian is speaking
and you &apos;re bogarting the symposium ?
howard , i &apos;m sorr ... we @-@ we ...
no , no , you &apos;re quark @-@ blocking us .
i don &apos;t know what to say .
howard , listen ... no , it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s your millennium falcon .
you and chewbacca do whatever you want to do .
me and princess leia here
will find some other way to spend the evening .
howard , wait. wai ...
sheldon , i think we should tell them .
okay , sure .
i don &apos;t see a problem with that .
there &apos;s no symposium .
leonard lied to me. isn &apos;t that right , leonard ?
i don &apos;t know what to say !
it &apos;s okay ; i do .
look , leonard is helping sheldon through a family crisis .
he made up the whole story about the symposium
with dr. farman ... farmian ...
good for you .
... because he didn &apos;t want sheldon to be embarrassed .
and there is nothing to be embarrassed about , okay ?
every family in america has a relative
holed up in a garage somewhere huffing paint thinner .
no , i &apos;m lost , too .
i think she skipped a step .
no , look .
sheldon &apos;s cousin leo escaped rehab ,
and he &apos;s in a motel 8 in long beach .
the whole family &apos;s going out for an intervention .
leonard is driving sheldon down there
to help him through this , because he &apos;s such a good man .
oh , another hug ? thank you .
all right , you guys , good luck .
thanks , penny .
oh-- break a leg .
break a leg .
so , road trip to long beach .
no. we &apos;re not going to long beach .
why not ?
because sheldon doesn &apos;t have
a drug @-@ addicted cousin leopold .
oh , too bad .
i &apos;ve always wanted to go to long beach .
it &apos;s a very nice community .
the queen mary is docked there .
once the largest ocean liner in the world ,
it &apos;s now a hotel and restaurant ,
where they host a surprisingly gripping
murder mystery dinner .
sounds fun . i &apos;m game .
shotgun !
no , no , no .
leonard gets nauseous unless he sits in front ,
and even then , it &apos;s iffy .
wait , are we ... really going to long beach ? !
leonard ?
leonard ? leonard ?
let it go , sheldon .
the murderer was the first mate
whether it makes sense to you or not .
no , that &apos;s the least of our worries .
i &apos;ve been doing some research on addiction--
both the biochemical and behavioral aspects--
and i think there &apos;s a problem
with the current version of our lie .
what are you talking about ?
it &apos;s fine-- she bought it ; it &apos;s over .
sadly , it &apos;s not .
substance abuse is a lifelong struggle ,
but beyond that , i have realized that the leo i described
would not have agreed to go to rehab .
why not ?
because leo &apos;s a middle child .
由于没有老大或最小的孩子那么 &quot; 受关注 , &quot; 因此产生的一些心理问题
there is no leo !
how can you say that ?
you didn &apos;t read the bio , did you ?
he &apos;s not just a middle child ,
he is the quintessential middle child--
from a broken home , to boot .
psychologically speaking , the attention he gets by rebelling ,
even to the point of self @-@ destruction ,
is more emotionally valuable than the help he would get at rehab .
i &apos;ve got a solution .
great. what is it ?
get out !
fine .
i &apos;ve hesitated to point this out ,
but i must now remind you that we
are in our current predicament because of your initial
and totally inadequate deceit .
i &apos;m just trying to clean up after your mess .
we &apos;ll talk in the morning .
morning .
who are you ?
i am sheldon &apos;s cousin leo .
sheldon does not have a cousin leo .
au contraire .
i &apos;m 26 years old .
i &apos;m originally from ... denton , texas ,
but i was a navy brat , so i was
brought up on a variety of military bases around the world .
as a result , i &apos;ve often felt like an outsider--
never really fitting in ,
which is probably the reason for my substance abuse problem .
excuse me , we just went over this .
as the quintessential middle child , your addiction
is rooted in your unmet need for attention .
oh , sheldon , are we really going to go with pop psychology ?
for your information , this is all based on solid research .
just stick with the character profile i wrote for you .
sheldon ? i &apos;m sorry .
leonard , this is toby loobenfeld .
he &apos;s a research assistant
in the particle physics lab ,
but he also minored in theater at mit .
it was more of a double major , actually .
theater and physics .
you can guess which one my bourgeois parents
pushed me toward .
yeah , i got it .
sheldon ... why ?
you see , while leo would not have gone into rehab ,
it is completely plauible that we would have talked him
into leaving the motel and coming home with us .
oh ... sheldon , how about this
as my motivation-- when i was 14 years old ,
i was abused in the philippines by a clubfooted navy chaplain .
no. we &apos;re going with middle child
and a genetic predisposition to inadequate serotonin production .
swell. how do i play genetic predisposition ?
subtextually , of course .
just have fun with it .
morning , penny .
hi. how did the intervention go ?
unfortunately , we weren &apos;t able to convince him to go to rehab .
oh. well , based on what you told me , i am not surprised .
but we did convince him to leave the motel .
come say hello .
leo. this is penny ,
our friend and neighbor .
hi , leo .
how are you feeling ?
let me ask you something , penny .
have you ever woken up in a fleabag motel
covered in your own vomit ,
next to a transsexual prostitute ?
no .
then don &apos;t ask me how i &apos;m feeling .
well , that &apos;s leo .
why don &apos;t you tell me about your showcase last night .
oh. it was okay , i guess .
it wasn &apos;t a big turnout ,
but they both really seemed to like it .
there were only two people there ?
by the end , yeah .
damn you , chaplain harrigan !
i &apos;m ... i &apos;m sorry ?
the philippines .
1992 .
the subic bay naval station .
a young boy on the cusp of manhood .
his only companions ,
mongrel dogs and malarial mosquitoes .
desperate and alone ,
he reached out to a man who promised to introduce him
to a merciful , loving god ,
but who instead introduced him
to a gin @-@ pickled tongue shoved down his adolescent throat .
what choice did he have but to drink ,
shoot and snort his pain away ?
don &apos;t forget his genetic predisposition towards addiction .
that &apos;s never been proven. there have been studies .
not double @-@ blind studies .
how could there be a double @-@ blind study ?
who would be the control group ?
as you can see , detoxing can get pretty ugly .
let &apos;s give them some privacy .
yeah .
hey , do you want to come over to my place , have coffee ?
oh , sounds good .
i have a video of me singing last night .
do you want to see it ?
gee , why wouldn &apos;t i ?
this is even better than you coming to the showcase ,
because now i get to watch you watch me .
yeah ...
funny how things work out .
... but he loved the companionship
and the wisdom that his own father failed to provide .
your parents made the right decision .
i cannot work like this .
this is amazing .
just sitting on a couch watching tv with a woman .
not being drunk or , or high
or wondering if you &apos;re a dude down there .
leo , you are a very sweet , really funny guy .
you &apos;re going to do okay .
one day at a time , penny .
one day at a time .
how long is he going to stay here ?
he &apos;s a homeless drug addict , leonard .
where is he going to go ?
