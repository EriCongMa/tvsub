The human life is made up of choices--
Yes or no, in or out, up or down.
And then there are the choices that matter...
To love or hate...
To be a hero or to be a coward...
To fight or to give in...
To live...
Or die.

My name...
My name is April Kepner. I'm 28 years old. I...
I was born on April 23 in o--in Ohio.
I'm from Columbus, Ohio.
Um... My mom--my mom is a teacher,
And m-my dad is a farmer-- corn--
C-corn-- he--he--he grows corn.
Their--their names are Karen and Joe.
I have three sisters. Libby's the oldest.
I'm--I'm next, and then there's K-Kimmie, then Alice.
I-I-I-I haven't don't anything yet.
I haven't... I've barely lived.
I--I'm not finished yet. No one's loved me yet.
Please. Please.
I'm someone's child.
I'm a person.
I'm a person.
Run.
Oh, Mr. Clark...
Mr. Clark...
Live or die...
That's the important choice.
And it's not always in our hands.
Derek could still be alive.
We could get shot.
I'm going, cristina. I am going-
No, no, no, no, you are not.
Please.
You'll get killed, and I'm not gonna let that happen.
You want to go, you gotta go through me.
We made it all the way home from Iraq alive,
And now there's this guy with his people-shooting hat on
right in here in a hospital,
which is arguably the safest place in the world.
Is there a point to this or...
I think you love me.
I think you love Cristina
and I think you love me, too.
And I think that you tried to get Shepherd to get rid of me
So that you wouldn't have to choose,
But people-shooting-hat guy is here, and,
Owen, for my sake
And for Cristina's sake, you have to choose.
Her or me?
Fine. No one.
No one. I'm choosing no one.
I'm taking myself out of this equation, and I am...
oh, my god.
He's dead.
We can't go to the I.C.U.
We stay here, we're sitting ducks.
I'm taking this patient out of here.
Who are you calling?
9-1-1.
Why are they only getting the civilians out?
Where's the hospital staff?
The policy is to clear the visitors,
room by room, floor by floor,
and remove them before removing any
nonessential hospital personnel.
Did they get the shooter?
Do you know where the shooter is?
Do you know who the shooter is?
No, sir.
Well, do you know anything?
This is Dr. Owen Hunt from Seattle Grace Hospital.
We're coming out with a critical patient.
Commander, I've got sound.
Dr. Callie Torres. I'm up on peds.
We've got a kid up here with a ruptured appendix.
Dr. Miranda Bailey. I'm on five.
He shot a doctor in the I.C.U...
There are two dead security guards-- for no reason, he--
This guy--6'1," graying hair, moustache--
And Dr. Charles Percy's been shot.
He shot a nurse, and I got a doctor up here...
Please come.
Karev.
We need help up here.
He's got a G.S.W. to the chest.
I need a way outta here if he's gonna make it.
He was looking for the chief...
We're hiding, but... Three people, they're dead.
Specifically the chief, and he shot him.
He shot Derek Shepherd right in front of us.
We need help.
Hold on, okay? Hold on. I love you.
Please don't die.
Get outta here, Meredith,
Before he shoots you, too.
Do not die! Do you understand?
I can't live without you.
I called the police.
You die, I die. Okay, good. They're coming.
The police are coming.
M-mer,
they're--they're not-- they're not gonna get here.
They're not coming for us, not--not in time.
Oh, god, mer. Mer--
I pick you. I choose you.
What are we-- what are we gonna do?
You don't get to die on me.
Derek needs surgery, so I--
No, you stay awake!
What do we do?
You stay awake! Stay awake.
Derek!
Derek, stay awake. Stay awake.
Okay. Okay.
April, come on.
We're taking Derek down to the o.R.
Teddy, sh-she's in the O.R. She can save him. Come on.
I saw on "Oprah" or somewhere
that if you tell them personal details about yourself,
they're less likely to kill you.
Kepner, get up. Come on. Come on. Oh.
Get up. Follow me. Just follow me.
You gotta eat more... Bacon.
What?
You stop yourself from doing a lot of crap
that you want to do in life.
I mean, I'm probably dying now,
And I'm telling you, you gotta eat more bacon,
Have more sex.
Okay. I will. I'll eat more bacon.
But you gotta hang in there,
'cause she's gonna be back any minute.
She had to go to the blood bank and back.
Oh, Mr. Clark.
I didn't plan to shoot all those people.
Of...
Of course you didn't. You were... Sad,
You were-- you were grieving.
I only planned to shoot Dr. Shepherd.
And Dr. Webber.
And you.
You unplugged the machines.
Your hands killed my Alison.
Is he dead?
He's unconscious. Vitals are tanking.
There's nothing more I can do for him.
Don't die. Alex, please don't die.
This was my fault.
I unplugged his wife.
I'm so sorry. This was my fault.
I love you.
Do you hear me?
I love you.
Now you're gonna feel a poke,
I know it's gonna hurt, but only for a little while.
No squirming.
It hurts!
Okay. All right. Squeeze my hand. Squeeze my hand.
Tight, tight, tight.
Good
Tight, tight, tight. Come on.
Oh, wow. You're strong.
There are only children here.
They shot me.
There are only children here.
There are only children here. There are only children here.
There are only children here. There are only children here.
There are only...
Mister, um...
Clark.
Gary clark.
There are only children here. There are only children here.
There are only children here.
Mr. Clark.
Here are some...
bandages.
There are only children here.
There are only children here. There are only children here.
I want my mommy.
Press them to the wound and...
it'll stop the bleeding.
I want my mommy.
...children here.
Okay? Just take them.
...only children here.
Take them.
There are only children here.
Take them and go.
There are only children here.
I want my mommy.
There are only children here. There are only children here.
There are only children here.
There are only children here.
Thank you.
There are only children here. There are only children here.
There are only children here. There are only children here.
There are only children here. There are only children here.
I want my mommy!
I want my mommy.
There's only children here.
All right. Okay. I know you do. I know. I know you do.
And she's gonna be back soon. But you know what?
Until she gets here,
you have the best doctor in the whole world with you right now.
Yeah, Dr. Robbins is the best doctor in this entire hospital.
Yeah, I-I think in the whole world.
Yeah, people feel so much better after she helps them.
Sometimes people feel better just after she walks in the room,
'cause she has got this super-magic smile.
Yeah, and when-- when she smiles at you,
everything gets better.
You don't know it,
'cause you have your back to her right now,
But she is giving you... she is giving you her best super-magics.
Isn't that right, Dr. Robbins?
Right.
I am, Ruby.
I am. I am.
Okay.
I gotta call the police and tell them what happened, okay?
I'm--I'm good.
I'm good.
All right.
Does the name Gary Clark mean anything to you?
Yes.
Gary Clark's wife was a patient here.
She was my patient.
He's-- he's suing the hospital. Why?
Mer, you, you prep him,
and April and I are gonna go find Teddy.
She should still be on this floor.
Okay.
Okay, everything is gonna be fine.
Okay, Mer? I promise.
Okay. Okay, they're going to find Teddy.
It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.
Kiss me.
I'm not gonna die. I promise.
Good. 'cause that would be the worst breakup ever.
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.
The packing isn't holding.
What does that mean?
It means... I need to get him to an O.R.
Someone is coming. Someone will come, like a-a cop...
No, we need to get him to an O.R.
That's his last chance if he's gonna live,
Okay?
How are we even gonna do that?
We can barely hold him up on his side.
There. There. There.
Give me the sheet.
Yeah, put it out.
It's creepy quiet down here.
He's down here.
No, he is not down here.
Oh, God. He's down here. He's down here.
He's gonna come out. He's gonna shoot us.
He's gonna sh--
Will you shut up?
You are freaking me out, and
I don't have time to be freaked out right now.
Sorry.
Okay, Mer is a mess,
Derek is a mess, you're a mess,
And I am in charge, and I say that no one is down here.
No, don't shoot! Don't shoot!
You are not supposed to be walking around.
Damn it, Jackson.
Is that your blood? Are you okay?
Oh, no, no, no, I'm fine.
Go get Altman.
Altman's not down here.
Go get Hunt then.
They left.
What-- they left?
Okay, you know what? Someone just shot Derek.
He's got a G.S.W. to the chest,
and he needs surgery right now.
Tell me there's an attending on this floor.
April, in the O.R. behind me, there are two O.R. nurses
and an anesthesiologist. Get 'em.
Tell 'em to set up for a cardiac procedure.
What--what--why?
If we don't have a surgeon, what are we gonna do?
We have a surgeon.
Who's gonna operate on Dr. Shepherd?
I am.
You can do this, right? You're sure?
Every G.S.W. is different. Okay? It's not a blueprint.
It's half instinct and half improv,
And... I'm very good.
For a resident, I'm very good.
You can't be in there.
I can't do this if you're in there staring at me
with big, sad "Don't kill McDreamy" eyes.
We're ready for you.
April...
Meredith is gonna sit here on the floor.
I want you to stay with her.
If she tries to enter my O.R.
or even if she looks like she's gonna get up to take a peek,
I want you to stop her, okay?
I don't care how. You stop her.
Okay.
He is my husband.
Do you want me to kill him? Okay? Is that what you want?
I will do the very best work.
But please, Meredith, I am begging you,
sit down and wait.
Izzie?
Alex...
It's Lexie. Alex.
Iz... I'm sorry.
Don't go.
We got married.
Please don't go.
I'm not going anywhere.
You came back for me, Iz.
I came back.
Don't ever leave me.
Don't ever leave me again.
I won't.
I won't ever leave you.
We're always gonna be together, okay?
Always.
Yeah.
This floor is clear.
We're going to evacuate you now.
We've cleared one floor.
We'll clear the others.
You've got five guys
searching 150,000 square feet of hospital--
that's how it works.
Don't worry. He's not getting outta there.
Casey.
Yes, sir.
Pull a D.M.V. photo of Gary Clark.
have Dr. Webber confirm. And shut down the elevators.
We want to isolate this guy, all right?
Where can I find Dr. Webber?
Well, he's right over...
Okay, we got a G.S.W. Straight from the O.R.
Still critical.
Let's get him to the paramedics.
You got him?
Have you gotten the shooter?
I need to clear you two.
Have you gotten the doctors out?
No, sir. This is a secure area.
I'm gonna need to move you over to holding.
She's still in there.
Teddy...
Go.
It's okay.
It's okay to choose.
Sir, you're not allowed-- I'm gonna need you to--sir!
Come back now!
Stop crying.
Look, it took me a long time to find him,
a long time.
And even then, it took me a long time
to even know that I wanted him--
To be married, to be his wife, to have his kids.
And now that I realize that...
he's lying on a table in there and my best friend's
hands are inside his chest.
You don't get to cry about that.
Reed was my best friend.
She died today.
G.S.W. To the right chest.
We put in a chest tube. He's got 3 liters of l.R.,
and two units of packed cells.
All right, let's get him into the ambulance.
Call Seattle Pres and let 'em know that we're coming.
He's gonna be okay...
Right?
Can you feel anything?
Can you see where the blood's coming from?
Not yet.
Damn it. You know what? I can't see anything.
Give me some suction. No, no, no, no, no.
It's right by the aorta.
You can do this.
I know that. I just wanted it to be easy,
Not the hardest freaking repair in the history of the world.
I don't know what to do.
There's massive bleeding in the lungs,
There is a bullet lodged right next to the aorta
and a huge hematoma.
Would Teddy use a graft or clamp and sew?
I think she'd--
Pig or cow?
What?
Pig or cow, Cristina?
Clamp and sew. Definitely clamp and sew.
Give me a clamp.
Badass.
How much further?
We're almost there.
We're gonna get him on the elevator,
and then we'll be right at the O.R. floor.
We're almost there.
We're almost there.
Okay, Charles?
We're almost there?
Yeah. Just a few more minutes.
Dr. B.?
There's a hum...
Elevators make when they're on.
There's a hum.
There's no hum.
What does that mean?
It means the elevators...
They're off.
The elevators aren't working!
The elevators aren't worng!
We need to get to the O.R.!
Shh. Please, stop yelling.
Turn the elevators back on! Turn them back on!
Oh, damn it!
Oh, my god! Turn the elevators back on!
Dr. B., please, please. Please.
That man is still here somewhere.
Turn the elevators back on!
And he'll hear us. Please. Shh.
Stop, stop, stop. Please, Dr. B.
Okay, okay...
What-- what are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?
Dr. B.?
What's the plan?
You have a plan, right, Dr. B.?
What do we do?
P-please.
We can't get to the O.R.
But he--he has to get to the o.R.
He has to get to the o.R. or he's--dr. B.?
Miranda.
We should be on a first-name basis.
Miranda.
Okay.
I'm dying, right?
Am I dying now?
Yes.
Yes, Charles. You are dying.
But I don't want you to worry.
I don't want you to be afraid,
'cause I am not going to leave you, okay?
Mary--Mary--Mary...
Mary and I...
Are gonna be with you the whole time.
You are not alone. You hear me?
You are not alone.
Owen! Thank god. Derek has been shot.
No one was down here. We didn't know what to do.
Cristina's in there. She told me not to look.
But she might need help.
Uh, she seems to be doing okay.
But I'll just head in there and see what I can do.
Wait, you're not scrubbing in?
I'll see first if she needs me,
then I'll scrub in.
Cristina was right. You should stay down there.
Okay? Don't move.
A real surgeon is here. That's a good thing.
That means that Derek's gonna be okay.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Just calm down. Calm down.
Tell me what the problem is.
Owen.
I'm here.
Owen.
Hey, whoa. Hold on. Talk to me.
Stop fixing him.
Let him die.
Let him lie there and die.
Do you want me to shoot you?
Stop fixing him!
No.
Cristina--
No.
Jackson, clamp the hilum
so you can get control of the hemorrhage
so I can get better visualization.
Don't you dare.
Clamp the hilum so I can see.
You step back.
You... stay back.
Owen, I can't stop. I have to keep going.
I know. I know. Just keep going. Keep going.
You stop or I will shoot you in the head.
Hey! Hey! That is the woman that I love.
You shoot her, you touch her, and I will kill you!
I said stay back.
Maybe I shoot you first.
I shoot you, and then I shoot her
And then I shoot shepherd. Is that what you want?
I didn't come here for this. My wife is dead.
He's responsible.
I came here for justice--
and eye for an eye.
The only person I want in this room is shepherd.
Now back off.
And you step away from that table.
Please.
Shoot me.
Meredith.
You want justice, right?
Your wife died.
I know what happened.
Derek told me the story.
Lexie Grey is the one who pulled the plug on your wife.
She's my sister.
Dr. Webber... he was your wife's doctor.
I'm the closest thing he has to a daughter.
And the man on the table...
I'm his wife.
If you want to hurt them the way that you hurt,
Shoot me. I'm your eye for an eye.
Meredith.
Meredith.
You tell derek that I love him and that I'm sorry.
Meredith.
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait. She--she's pregnant.
You wouldn't shoot a woman who's pregnant?
Please.
No! No! No!
Oh... No.
Raise your-- raise your hands.
What?
Trust me. Raise your hands. He's gonna shoot again.
Raise your hands.
I'm stopping. I'm stopping. I'm stopping.
No!
See? See? I stopped.
Listen to me. In a few seconds,
his heart is gonna pump all the blood into his chest
and stop beating.
You'll see it on the monitor.
Just wait. Wait for it.
Watch the monitor and wait for it.
Please don't stop.
Shut up!
No. No.
No!
Derek!
No. No. No.
See?
It's over.
It's over. He's dead.
It's over.
Derek!
Give me a 4-0 pledgeted suture,
And let's start the tractotomies.
Jackson, get me his vitals.
Got a pulse--128. B.P.'s cycling.
I...
Mer, is Owen dead?
Dr. Grey, is Owen dead?!
He's... he's alive.
He's alive. He's unconscious, but he's alive.
Take owen to the O.R. across the way,
and take that bullet out and get April to help you.
Cristina--
I can't talk right now.
I'm trying to save your guy.
now please go and try and save mine.
Remind to thank you later.
I will.
I don't hurt anymore.
The pain's gone.
That's a bad sign, isn't it?
Yes.
Can you do something for me?
Can you find reed?
When this is over, can you find her?
I always...
I always had a crush on her. I don't think she knows.
She knows.
Girls always know.
Yeah?
Yeah.
But can you...
tell her anyway?
Can you find her and tell her I loved her?
I loved her so much.
Okay.
And you tell her...
You tell her I was a catch.
You tell her I was a hot, hot catch,
and she missed out on a great guy.
All right.
And you tell her I was brave.
Even if I turn coward and start crying
and asking for my mom in a minute...
You lie and tell her I died brave, okay?
You are very brave, Charles.
Okay? I'm the coward.
I'm... the one that told that man I was a nurse.
You're smart.
You were smart.
I wish I was that smart.
Tell her I loved her. You won't forget?
I won'forget.
I-I know you don't like me.
I like you.
No, you don't.
But you were always my favorite doctor.
I thought you should...
It's not bad. I'm fine.
I got-- just stay--st--
stop--stop moving!
Upper left shoulder... Through and through.
You're gonna be fine.
That's what I've been try to tell you.
Just let me get u--
Don't even think about trying to get off this table.
So we need to irrigate, get some antibiotics on board.
Um, do you want to work on the shoulder or do you--
Are you ok
Yeah. Um, I'm okay.
Are you sure?
Oh, my god. Did you get shot?
No, I didn't get shot, okay?
I'm--I'm o--I'm okay.
But you could be in shock and not know it.
Here, let me feel you for--
I'm...
I'm okay.
But there's blood spreading down your thighs.
I'm...
I'm having a miscarriage.
We need a stapler.
We need lidocaine, morphine and an irrigation tray.
Come on. Are you gonna help me or not? Let's go.
I've been looking for you.
I've been looking for you.
You want to know something funny?
Do you?
Okay.
Five days ago...
When I bought this gun...
Did you know you could buy a gun at a superstore?
They have a whole... section of aisle eight...
A gun section.
Anyway, when--when...
when I bought the gun, I...
I got all this ammunition--
ammo.
I bought a whole bunch of it 'cause...
it was-- it was on sale.
And then this morning...
I was packing it into my coat.
I didn't have enough room for all of it in my pockets...
Because...
I wanted to bring my flask.
You mind?
I'm not much of a drinker.
But I figured I'd need some liquid courage.
You want some?
No, thanks.
The funny part is...
I didn't need a drink until now--
Right now.
And the only reason I need a drink
is because...
I only have one bullet left.
I left bullets at home
because I thought I'd need a drink.
And the only reason I need a drink is because...
I don't have enough bullets.
See, I was gonna kill you...
Shoot you right in the face...
Watch you suffer and die.
And then I was gonna shoot myself.
But I only have one bullet left.
Then it seems, you have a bit of a problem.
I do.
I do.
I have one hell of a problem.
You sure you don't want a drink?
Vodka.
That's nice.
Hey.
What's it gonna be, Mr. Clark?
Me or you?
You shoot me, S.W.A.T.'s gonna get you.
And they're not gonna shoot you.
They're gonna capture you
and they're gonna take you to prison.
Or you shoot yourself...
then you're free...
Done...
Maybe get to see your wife again.
So you have a choice to make.
Me or you?
A life in prison...
or an afterlife with your wife?
S-screw you.
See, I've lived.
I mean, I've really, really lived.
I've failed...
I've been devastated, I've been broken...
I've gone to hell and back.
And I've also known joy... and passion.
And I've had a great love.
See...
Death for me...
is not justice.
It's an... end of a beautiful journey.
And I'm not afraid to die.
The question is...
are you?
A life in prison...
or an afterlife... with your wife?
Me or you?
Your choice.
Yes or No...
In or Out...
Up or Down...
Okay, you know what? I'm almost done.
Just finishing up the pericardial repair.
V-fib.
Oh, no.
Give me the internal paddle. Give me 1 of epi.
April, you got it?
Yep.
Charge to 50.
Clear.
Bill!
Mary! Mary!
Are you okay?
Ma'am, what was the name again?
Tell me. Dr. Reed who?
Epi going in.
Charge again to 50. Clear.
I'm gonna go see
if kids need help finding their parents.
People died.
People are dead. I...
I don't want to have kids if it means I can't be with you.
No.
No.
We'll have kids.
We'll have all kinds of kids.
I always thought that I wasn't cut out to be a mom,
But you'll be a great mom.
You'll be an amazing mom,
and... I love you so much,
and I can't live without you and our ten kids and--
We got him.
Oh.
We got him.
Live or Die...
Hero or Coward...
Fight or Give in...
I'll say it again to make sure you hear me--
The human life is made up of choices.
Live or Die...
That's the important choice.
Mer.
Huh?
Derek's asking for you.
Okay.
And it's not always...
In our hands.
