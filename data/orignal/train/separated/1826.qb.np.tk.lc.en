when you get sick ,
it starts out with a single bacterium ...
one alone , nasty intruder .
pretty soon , the intruder duplicates ...
becomes two .
then those two become four ...
and those four become eight .
then ...
before your body knows it ...
it &apos;s under attack .
oh , hey. you can &apos;t put that in there .
oh , they told us to grab a cubby .
yeah , i know. it &apos;s just ... we keep it empty for a reason .
can you just take your stuff out ?
there are some empty ones over there you can use .
i don &apos;t think so .
i said take it out .
great . i got the crazy one next to me .
oh , you want to fight ? &apos; cause i will .
izzie. iz .
i will fight you. you &apos;re pretty tiny
take you down in just a second .
come on .
stop .
it &apos;s an invasion .
the question for a doctor is ,
once the invaders have landed ,
once they &apos;ve taken over your body ...
they took george &apos;s cubby .
how the hell do you get rid of them ?
they &apos;re locusts comfortable locusts ,
feeding on our surgeries .
it &apos;s rude .
there should be at least a couple of days
where they act like guests
before they put their feet up on the coffee table .
and what &apos;s with the orange scrubs ?
what , ours aren &apos;t good enough for &apos; em ?
we ran out. they are back order
randall from the supply company
says there &apos;ll be here a week .
that &apos;s what you learn when you lie here all day .
my bother ordering new ones ?
we could just give these to our replacements .
we &apos;re not gonna be replaced by anybody .
if i have to become a coroner ...
no one is becoming a coroner .
cristina , tell him .
tell him what ? they &apos;re here. it &apos;s over .
hey. we are not some stupid hosts. they can &apos;t invade us .
they can &apos;t attach themselves to our faces
and then while we &apos;re eating spaghetti ,
explode out of our chests and skitter across the floor .
this is our ship. this is our ship .
excuse me. are you-- are you quoting
a sigourney weaver movie ?
shut up .
that &apos;s what happens when you live here .
you watch a lot of tv .
we own this hospital .
we were born in this hospital .
and we will hold this hospital with our last gasping breath .
i really don &apos;t want to be a coroner .
i don &apos;t like dead people .
go out there and go get surgeries before they take them .
go ! and i want a full report by the end of the day .
and what is wrong with you ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m fighting for .
surgeries , christina .
surgeries .
there will be a cardio god here again one day .
and when there is , you don &apos;t want to be out of practice .
now go .
is this overflow from mercy west ?
yeah , their--their e.r. closed for good last night .
everyone &apos;s coming over here .
i want a person emergent .
ah , our new attending .
hey. first day back ?
yeah .
you picked a good one. it &apos;s nice and quiet , not a lot going on .
yeah . thank you .
okay , where do you want us ?
uh , at this point , anywhere is good .
at mercy west , recovering .
when it &apos;s super busy , we just give everyone a zone , a space .
the nurses put a person in that space ,
you know it &apos;s your patient. helps you get to &apos; em quicker .
yeah , well , this is the e.r. not a school yard .
we &apos;re not playing four square .
i like it .
what ?
it &apos;s a good idea. let &apos;s try it. what &apos;s your name ?
jackson avery .
dr . avery , dr. hunt. now you are slowing .
let &apos;s go .
chief .
what do you need , karev ?
thank you . i know you still have cuts to make this a nobel one .
i just want you to keep in mind
that izzie stevens is not 100 % back yet .
i mean , she &apos;s recovering .
look , she--she just-- she needs this .
i have a hospital to run , karev .
i have two hospitals to run .
hey , that wasn &apos;t cool .
what ?
in the locker room .
my friend should &apos;ve left that cubby empty . i &apos;m sorry .
well , she &apos;s obviously not , so--
it &apos;s the first day of school. everyone &apos;s on edge .
i &apos;ll probably kill someone before the day is through .
i &apos;m charles , by the way . charles percy .
it might be kinda hard for you not to talk to me all day .
it can be done .
i almost didn &apos;t talk to my family
for a car ride across the whole country--
10 days , 15 states , not a peep .
just read books , pretended i was a hostage .
izzie stevens .
well , nice to meet you , izzie stevens .
hey , do you happen to know
the key code to the research library ?
i was here last night , and it was closed .
it took me two years to get that code .
i need every advantage i can get .
did the gentleman from the waiting room
ever find you ?
what ?
it &apos;s the gentleman who could possibly be your father .
what ?
daddy .
calliope .
what ... what are you doing here ?
i came to see you .
why ?
calliope , we used to talk .
every sunday , we used to talk .
i &apos;d wait for your call , and you &apos;d tell me everything ,
all about your crazy adventures .
even when you were in trouble ,
you &apos;d still call ,
and we worked it out .
we &apos;d always work it out , mija .
daddy .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m sorry things got so ...
sure .
but the fact that you came ...
daddy , is that father kevin ?
hello , calliope .
wh ... are you t ...
two here to ...
you think you can pray away the gay .
we can just sit and talk .
oh , no . you can &apos;t pray away the gay .
calliope i way the gay !
you can &apos;t pray away the gay !
the man flew 3,000 miles to make me straight ...
with a priest .
i &apos;m lucky they didn &apos;t march into the e.r. swinging incense ,
all ... all happed up for an exorcism .
are you done yet ?
am i ... no ! he came here to disinfect you from my life .
you don &apos;t find that abhorrent ?
i do , but ...
there is no &quot; but , &quot; okay ? oh , what , you &apos;re gonna--
you &apos;re gonna tell me you get where he &apos;s coming from ?
maybe you should try and talk to him .
i have nothing to say .
if he wants to throw away our relationship after 30 years ,
then that &apos;s his decision .
he hasn &apos;t done anything here .
you &apos;re the one who changed the game .
y @-@ you didn &apos;t expect a little understanding
when you came out to your parents ?
uh ... i never had boyfriends ... ever .
i had a poster on my wall of cindy crawford ,
and i wasn &apos;t just looking at her mole .
it wasn &apos;t news to my mom
when i brought somebody home named joanne .
but you , you dated men your whole life .
you loved men. you even married one .
you want to talk about 30 years of a relationship ?
you know , he &apos;s been consistent for 30 years .
and all of a sudden , you &apos;re a whole new girl .
so ... cut him some slack .
sit down and have a conversation .
give him room to be a little shocked .
i hate you .
&apos;cause i &apos;m right and i &apos;m awesome .
thanks for being my tour guide
through all this first @-@ day madness .
well , we both got assigned zone five , so ...
i know it &apos;s not like you had any choice .
still , you &apos;re a peach to pretend otherwise .
being the new kid is ...
a little scary , i know .
of course , you were here when that psycho @-@ intern cabal
was marching around chopping out each other &apos;s organs .
now that must have been scary .
hi . i &apos;m dr. kepner . oh , handcuffs .
i &apos;m not an ax murderer .
i just broke in to someone &apos;s house .
dude came after me with a golf club ,
beat the crap out of me .
look , you don &apos;t need the cop . i can barely move. roll him .
oh , we &apos;ll keep the cop .
he &apos;s got multiple contusions and ecchymosis over his back .
he &apos;s gonna need lumbar and thoracic films. down .
okay , and by the way , it was one organ ... an appendix .
it wasn &apos;t a psycho cabal .
good to know .
hey , sarah .
dr. stevens .
okay , i have to go . the doctors are here .
my sister and her daughters want you all to promise them
it &apos;s a good kidney .
it &apos;s a good kidney .
there , all right ? bye .
uh , sarah fremont , age 27 . end @-@ stage renal disease .
on dialysis for three years , waiting for a kidney .
she &apos;s down to her last access site .
that &apos;s the polite way of saying
they &apos;ve run out of places to stick the needles .
ms. fremont has a subclavian catheter for access .
why is this not ideal ?
it &apos;s difficult to obtain sufficient blood flow
through ...
oh . you guys raise hands .
frank nusbaum , 42 , multiple ,
mostly superficial stab wounds . vital signs stable .
his buddy &apos;s got a lacerated palm .
got it . thanks , ray .
i &apos;m not his buddy !
he touched my little girl , my baby !
she &apos;s not a baby . she &apos;s 19 years old .
there ain &apos;t a scrap of baby left there ,
on three . one two three .
okay , okay , we got a bleeder here .
uh , draw me up some lidocaine and , uh ,
get me a lac tray with 3 @-@ 0 silk .
need any help ?
sir , this is gonna pinch .
ugh ! he came at me with a carving knife .
he tried to cut off my ...
come on . i was gesturing !
you ran into it at the knife .
tie
you &apos;re an idiot and a pervert .
tie .
she used to babysit your brats .
i can &apos;t believe i ever let her in your house !
i love her , don .
i love her , and she loves me .
i &apos;m gonna kill him .
easy , all right ?
let him die . just let him die . it &apos;s what he deserves .
you shut him up !
are you sure there &apos;s nothing i can do
there . what ? that &apos;s how we do it on our side of town .
nice try .
this is my zone . he &apos;s my patient .
yet i &apos;m the one actually helping him .
how long have you been having stomach pains ?
uh , a few days now . hm , they keep getting worse .
my dad a fell a couple of months ago ,
had a stable hip fracture
excuse me . this is my patient .
not anymore.- fine .
good luck doing an h &amp; p without a chart .
i &apos;ll just add this to the chart later .
if you can find it .
this is the nurses &apos; lounge .
it is literally always someone &apos;s birthday ,
so if you &apos;re nice to the nurses , you will get cake .
the lab .
how &apos;s the i.l.-2 going , dr. s. , good ?
good .
i.l.-2 , huh ? are you feeling ...
stable for now .
and you don &apos;t want anyone to know
because they &apos;ll be blown away by the fact
that you &apos;re already back at work
and they &apos;ll only be able to think of you
as some sort of awesome super woman ,
which clearly , you are .
okay , you know what ?
the fake flattery ? it &apos;s kinda gross .
you want to know something deeply personal about me ?
you see that girl ? her name &apos;s reed .
i have the biggest crush in the world on her ,
and she doesn &apos;t even know i &apos;m alive .
she calls me charlie .
nobody named charlie ever got the girl .
charlie brown , charlie manson .
i &apos;m not trying to minimize your cancer or anything ,
but this really sucks for me .
you like her ?
i love her .
what &apos;s that ?
the code to the research library .
&quot; while performance has been evaluated ,
the largest considerations have been budgetary . &quot;
this is the speech we want you to use
when you &apos;re firing staff .
these exact words . don &apos;t deviate .
i &apos;m not using your speech to fire people ,
and i don &apos;t need an h.r. chaperone .
thank you for your time .
chief , are you familiar with megan nowlan ?
mm , yes , yeah . uh , she was an intern .
she was married to steve mostow .
i fired her . i know how to fire people .
i don &apos;t like it
but i know how to do it , and i do it well .
you used an e @-@ mail to fire her ,
and now she &apos;s suing the hospital for wrongful termination ,
claims she was fired because she was pregnant .
so ...
this is the speech .
don &apos;t deviate .
t &amp; l spine films showed a burst fracture at t @-@ 12 .
and here you can see evidence of instability
because the vertebral height loss is greater than 50 %
which implies both a.l.l. and p.l.l. are disrupted .
what &apos;s that mean ? i got a broken back ?
i &apos;ll still be able to walk , right ?
you will still be able to walk , burgle
have a full life .
ideas ?
decompression via corpectomy and reconstruction
with strut graft and anterior instrumentation .
wow . i might be out of my league here .
well , she has a photographic memory .
we &apos;re all out of that league .
and here i was thinking you could do transpedicle screws
with a posterior approach .
seemed like a good idea , but , you know , maybe not .
let &apos;s go with the pedicle screws .
okay , get him into pre @-@ op ,
and let me know when his test results come back .
i &apos;m on it .
frank . oh . oh , my god .
honey , are you okay ?
i &apos;ll be fine , sweetheart .
get off of her , you perv !
daddy .
i will kill you , you son of a bitch !
security !
stop !
nice work .
thanks . i got it from here .
cool .
awesome .
you da man .
tackle like that , you had to play football .
i played a little in college .
safety ?
and wide receiver , yeah .
offense and defense . impressive .
c @-@ can you bring that guy over later ?
i want to thank him .
he saved my life .
no , i saved your life .
i &apos;m still saving it .
you paged ? yes . i ran a c.t.
on your guy with an adrenal mass
turns out he has an adrenal mass .
thought you might want to see the scans .
i was waiting until i got the lab
results to orderng her a c.t.
you stole my lab results ?
and look , now i get a surgery for all my trouble .
excuse me , dr. karev
my dad and i have some more questions .
he &apos;s still pretty upset .
yeah , i &apos;ll be there in a minute . thanks .
i &apos;ll take those .
you gonna fight back at some point
or just let her bury you ?
she &apos;s not burying me . she &apos;s new .
she &apos;s just finding her footing .
she found her footing on the back of your neck .
what do you care ?
i don &apos;t know . i like you .
no , i like that .
stop .
find her open window .
everyone has one--
a weak spot , undefended .
and open window or a key hidden in a fake rock ,
that &apos;s how i do it .
yeah , well , you &apos;re a criminal , and i &apos;m not .
it &apos;s not a crime to do to her what she &apos;s doing to you .
which is what , exactly ?
making you look like an idiot .
have you talked to any of them ?
who ?
the mercy westers .
yeah .
and ?
and ... i love you .
no , not that . i need to know what &apos;s going on out there .
i need to know how cristina &apos;s doing .
she was cardio deprived and depressed .
are you and cristina in a dark and twisty place ?
are you having the dark and twisties ?
we are .
both of you are dark and twisty ?
i told you , we are .
okay .
uh , excuse me. dr. hunt , uh , you paged me ?
your patient was having neurologic symptoms
and you didn &apos;t notice , karev ?
well , i
lucky for you dr. adamson did
and correctly diagnosed
book an o.r. for the afternoon .
what about the surgery for his adrenal tumor ?
your dad has a 90 % blockage in his right carotid artery .
we need to operate on that first .
now i know that &apos;s a lot to digest ,
but dr . adamson here will keep you informed ,
we &apos;re talk do respect . doctor hunt
mr. goldman is my patient .
i found the tumor .
yeah , and when i operate on the tumor ,
you can scrub in on that. in the meantime ,
i want you to help dr. adamson
prepare the patient for the cea
sir .
whatever she needs , karev .
neurologic symptoms ?
you didn &apos;t put that in the chart .
oh , i didn &apos;t ? hmm .
all right , fine. i @-@ i get it .
i sprang this on you . it was a lot to take in .
and ... you feel like you don &apos;t have much experience
with gay people ,
even though uncle berto hasn &apos;t been single
for 60 years for no reason .
calliope
it &apos;s still an adjustment .
that said ...
you should &apos;ve adjusted by now .
i mean you supposed to love me .
no matter what that &apos;s ... what a parent does .
i love you with all my heart .
but with all that &apos;s going on with you now , it &apos;s ...
look , i &apos;m scared for you .
it &apos;s an abomination. it &apos;s an eternity in hell .
let &apos;s not start with words like &quot; hell . &quot;
oh , that &apos;s why you flew 3,000 miles ,
to tell me i was going to hell ?
i thought you came here to apologize .
i can &apos;t apolog s amazing
i don &apos;t understand what happened
or where i went wrong .
where you went wrong ?
okay , leviticus .
thou shalt not lie with a man as one lies with a female . &quot;
oh , don &apos;t do that , daddy. don &apos;t quote the bible at me .
&quot; the outcry of sodom and gomorrah is great ,
and th @-@ their sin is exceedingly grave . &quot;
calliope , this is not what we
jesus &quot; a new commandment that i give unto you
that you love one another .
romans ,
jesus-- &quot; he who is without sin among you ,
let him cast the first stone .
so you admit it &apos;s a sin ?
&quot; blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy . &quot;
jesus blessed are the pure in heart , for they shall see god . &quot;
jesus blessed are those who have been persecuted for righteousness sake
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven .
jesus is my savior , daddy , not you .
and jesus would be ashamed of you for judging me !
he would be ashamed of you for turning your back on me
he would be ashamed of you
with this kind of injury ,
there is a chance that you could end up
with severe weakness in your legs .
that &apos;s okay .
i carry the stuff out with my arms , not my legs .
this is serious , billy .
you &apos;re gonna fix me up fine . listen ...
i &apos;ve got a present for you .
you stole her notebook ?
keep it down . you want my cop all over this ?
don &apos;t you get it ? this is her open window .
i don &apos;t--i don &apos;t want her open window .
&quot; you &apos;re not just a good doctor. you &apos;re a great doctor . &quot;
&quot; you are the future of medicine . &quot;
&quot; only you can keep you down . &quot;
and my favorite is , uh ...
&quot; no one can tell it &apos;s plastic surgery . &quot;
oh , my god .
i think it &apos;s the nose , but it could be the boobs .
what do you think ?
g @-@ give it back to her , and stop reading it .
&quot; future of medicine &quot; alert .
you haven &apos;t seen my notebook anywhere , have you ?
small , red , i was-- i was holding it all morning .
um , i m not sure .
um-- so much for that photographic memory .
good luck finding it .
this blows .
getting your ass kicked ?
shut up .
i hear yours got a standing ovation in the e.r.
yours is the one who saved the whole er
from the maniac with the hammer ?
okay , he didn &apos;t save anyone .
he did some stupid ninja leap
and then tripped a guy .
i used actual medicine to stop a person from dying .
well , mine has a notebook ,
that she takes notes in ,
a very personal nature , and i stole it .
you what ?
give it .
no. no , i @-@ i am not sinking to their level .
they are vindictive and they are aggressive
and--and they are not team players .
and if we are not careful ,
that spirit is going to infect our hospital .
we have to fight it .
which is why you stole her notebook ? and read it ?
well , she &apos;s not a very nice person .
hey .
oh , score. you rock .
oh , no. that &apos;s not for you .
who &apos;s it for then ?
charles .
your mercy wester ? !
they &apos;re handing us our asses on a plate ,
and you &apos;re serving &apos; em coffee ?
charles is actually kind of awesome .
and if you all could get past your sad , little egos ,
you would realize , you can &apos;t write off
all of the mercy west residents just &apos; cause you feel threatened .
oh , we don &apos;t feel threatened .
no .
yeah , we feel pretty threatened .
dudes ... they &apos;re not here .
hallelujah .
they &apos;re not eating. they &apos;re working .
oh , my god. they don &apos;t eat lunch .
oh , god !
wh @-@ what &apos;s going on ?
pulsatile mass over the stab wound .
what are we looking at , dr. avery ?
can &apos;t be sure without an angio ,
but i think it &apos;s a pseudoaneurysm .
i think you &apos;re right .
keep pressure on it. let &apos;s get him up to angio ,
and if it &apos;s positive , you &apos;re scrubbing in .
thank you , sir .
but that &apos;s my patient .
he was here , and you weren &apos;t .
dr. hunt !
what ?
cristina , what ? what ?
that doesn &apos;t matter that that &apos;s my patient or my surgery ?
you &apos;re prioritizing based on some sort of random code ,
some stupid rule you have not to favor me ?
this--this is one surgery .
forget it .
the woman does whatever i ask .
i want something ...
she gets it for me .
the research library ?
anytime you want to go in , it &apos;s closed ,
just say the word. she gave me the code to the place .
you &apos;re kidding .
she can &apos;t do enough for me .
it &apos;s like i have my own surgical bitch .
didn &apos;t go well , huh ?
well , at least now i can move on with my life .
stop entertaining any thoughts
of actually getting back together with my family .
whatever . i don &apos;t need a father .
i don &apos;t ...
not one who won &apos;t accept me .
i know .
well , his vital signs are fine .
b.p. looks good .
i hurt .
the neck ... blood ...
what ?
in head ...
place ... 12 .
what &apos;s happening here ?
i &apos;m not sure .
we &apos;re gonna have to , uh , hold off on the o.r.
pathetic .
look , he just said a bunch of weird crap , okay ?
he has expressive aphasia ,
which means broca &apos;s area ,
which is the left side of the brain .
you said it was the right side that was blocked .
5 % of people have broca &apos;s on the right .
you want to take that chance ?
what if it &apos;s a brain met from the tumor ?
oh , right. because you diagnosed a tumor ,
now it &apos;s a met .
i &apos;ve seen this before. have you ?
enough ! your behavior has been disgusting .
i mean , all you &apos;ve done all day is take pleasure
in how the other one got it wrong , how they screwed it up .
this is my father ...
my father .
and ... and you are supposed to be healers .
that &apos;s what you &apos;re job &apos;s supposed to be ,
to heal people .
we &apos;re gonna run some more tests , ma &apos;am .
we &apos;re ... very sorry .
thank you .
dr. stevens , can i talk to you for a minute ? go away .
picked up the labs for you .
if you want , i can take care of the dialysis .
i &apos;ve got this . i don &apos;t need a surgical bitch. thanks .
izzie , it wasn &apos;t personal .
that stuff , it just ... comes with the job .
i &apos;d expect you to do the same thing to me .
outside of work , you can be friends .
but inside , it &apos;s a whole different story .
at least it was at mercy west .
well , that isn &apos;t how it is here .
here , we don &apos;t just think about ourselves .
we support one another. we have each other &apos;s backs .
we--we throw ourselves in front of buses
to save the lives of complete strangers .
you will never measure up to the people we &apos;ve lost .
let &apos;s do a 140 @-@ base sodium , 37 @-@ base biocarb
and a zero @-@ k bath with an ultrafiltration of 3.5 liters .
that , i suppose , makes everything quite all right .
oh , this ?
cristina--
cristina .
cristina , talk to me. no .
cristina .
he wouldn &apos;t ...
what happened ?
here .
talk to me. tell me what happened .
nothing .
nothing is happening to me .
you know , i don &apos;t-- i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m doing .
i &apos;m , like , chasing after surgeries
i don &apos;t care about .
do you know how long it &apos;s been since i &apos;ve held a heart in my hand ...
since i felt that ...
that joy , that rush ?
you know ...
i miss burke .
i @-@ i m--i miss him all day .
i miss--you know , i @-@ i--
it &apos;s--it &apos;s not the relationship or--or the sex .
i miss ...
every day when he was here , i held hearts .
and i got picked , not because of some favoritism ,
but because it was just , like , it was right .
and i learned . i learned .
and i felt seen .
and now you know what ? i don &apos;t know what .
i spent this entire day fighting ...
and i @-@ i don &apos;t want to do it anymore .
come over here .
no , i have a method all my own .
uh , if you &apos;ll notice , the coat came first ,
then the tie , then the shirt .
now , uh , according to hoyle ,
after that , the , uh , pants should be next .
there &apos;s where i &apos;m different .
where are we at with billy sheehan ?
he &apos;s ready . i helped put him under .
he &apos;s prepped and positioned .
i thought we said i was handling that .
oh , yeah , we did . i just wanted to make absolutely sure
everything was ready for dr. shepherd .
well , your first day here ,
and already you &apos;re making my life easier .
yeah , dr. kepner--no , she &apos;s not just a good doctor .
she &apos;s--she &apos;s a great doctor . in fact , if you ask me ,
she &apos;s the future of medicine .
only you can keep yourself down , right ?
by the way , i can tell .
d @-@ dr. shepherd , i just need a moment .
look at this .
acute on chronic subdural hematoma .
that &apos;s not mets .
no , it &apos;s a brain bleed .
which would explain the aphasia and the numbness .
it would explain everything . i &apos;ll tell neuro .
oh , no. nice try . i &apos;ll tell neuro .
i &apos;m the one that said it was a brain issue .
the only reason why you knew that was because i got
the ball rolling by diagnosing the carotid stenosis .
can &apos;t you give it a rest ?
didn &apos;t you hear what goldman &apos;s daughter said ?
sorry .
i &apos;ll stop if you stop .
i &apos;ve stopped . you can have it .
talk to arizona robbins-- she &apos;s head of neuro .
she &apos;s not really head of neuro , is she ?
what the hell happened ? !
push another 2 of ativan now .
get me new chemistries and an e.k.g.
get the crash cart in here now .
start ventilating her .
torsades ? you gave her torsades ?
what the hell did you do to her ?
i didn &apos;t do anything .
you were the one who was with her last .
page bailey .
i already did .
clear . clear !
i don &apos;t know you well enough to talk about her .
we &apos;re not gonna do that .
most people think that i was named for the state ,
but it &apos;s not true .
i was named for a battleship-- the &quot; u.s.s. arizona . &quot;
my grandfather was serving on the arizona
when the japanese bombed pearl harbor ,
and he saved ... 19 men
before he drowned .
pretty much everything my father did his whole life
was about honoring that sacrifice .
i was raised to be a good man in a storm ,
raised to love my country ,
love my family
and protect the things i love .
when my father ...
colonel daniel robbins of the united states marine corps ,
heard that i was a lesbian ,
he said he only had one question .
i was prepared for
&quot; how fast can you get the hell out of my house ? &quot;
but instead ...
it was ...
&quot; are you still who i raised you to be ? &quot;
my father believes in country
the way that you believe in god .
and my father is not a man who bends ,
but he bent for me because i &apos;m his daughter .
i &apos;m a good man in a storm .
i love your daughter ,
and i protect the things i love .
not that i need to . she doesn &apos;t need it .
she &apos;s strong and caring ...
and honorable .
and she &apos;s who you raised her to be .
she &apos;s alive , barely .
is she still gonna get the kidney ?
i &apos;m asking the questions right now , stevens .
dr. percy here tells me that you were in charge
of sarah &apos;s dialysis .
is that true ?
yes .
he also says that you were pretty upset with him .
i don &apos;t see what that has to do with anything .
it has to do with the fact that your mental state
may have clouded your judgment ,
may have made you a less competent doctor ,
may have led you to read the labs wrong
or not read them at all .
otherwise , why would you tell the tech
to give sarah a zero @-@ k bath
when her potassium this morning was 3.4 ?
you sucked all the potassium out of that woman .
you stopped her heart .
she &apos;s alive , but she &apos;s not getting her kidney .
after three years of waiting ,
somebody else will be getting her kidney .
and if we don &apos;t find her another one
in the next three days ,
she &apos;s going to be dead ,
and you will have killed her .
ah , the surgery went pretty well , mr. sheehan .
we had good bone alignment .
and i &apos;ll be back to my old self ?
i &apos;ll be able to get around ?
get around ? yes .
uh , to where you were ? no , probably not .
probably about 70 % ,
which is good considering your injuries .
i guess that means
i only steal 70 % as much stuff .
billy ...
you see this ?
i noticed this afternoon
there were splotches all over the page , and ...
they &apos;re tears .
she was crying when she wrote this stuff .
she &apos;s scared .
and--and these stupid little sayings ,
they make her feel better .
this is her comfort .
we stole her comfort from her .
you and me , we &apos;re-- we &apos;re taking things from people ,
and we &apos;re leaving them at 70 % .
you promised .
you promised my nieces i was getting this kidney .
i &apos;m sorry .
i am ... so , so sorry .
but i am going to make this right .
i &apos;m going to get you another kidney .
it &apos;s my sister .
what do i tell her ?
i &apos;m sorry .
it must be hard , being the new people ,
being the invaders .
but that &apos;s no excuse for you being a ...
look , i @-@ i don &apos;t like you .
but what i did ...
that was over the line .
oh , i &apos;m sorry . i thought you wanted to see me .
this is missy grant from human resources .
you &apos;re kidding me .
you &apos;re firing me ?
stevens
you can &apos;t do that .
you can &apos;t fire me for-- for having cancer .
i &apos;m pretty sure that that &apos;s five kinds of illegal .
this is not about the cancer .
it &apos;s about the kidney patient ?
i made a mistake . i ...
but doctors make mistakes in this hospital every day .
yes , but when there &apos;s--
you let me come back after i cut an l @-@ vad wire .
that was a different era . times have changed .
dr. shepherd and dr. hunt ...
had concerns about your stamina
and emotional stability .
and dr. karev has questions about
alex ?
alex said something to you ?
dr. webber .
in the wake of the merger with mercy west ,
the needs of the hospital have changed .
while performance is evaluated ...
the largest considerations are budgetary .
there was simply no room on the staff .
please don &apos;t do this to me .
please don &apos;t take this away from me .
i don &apos;t have anything left . please .
what do you do when the infection hits you ...
calliope ?
when it takes over ?
i can &apos;t do this anymore .
you &apos;ll , you know , see me in hell .
listen to me , please .
i have to catch you .
what ?
your whole life , you ...
you &apos;ve always been on a bridge , calliope ,
ever since you were a little girl .
and you don &apos;t just walk on it either .
no , you climb on the railing
and you &apos;re-- you &apos;re ready to leap .
and when you do , when that happens ...
i have to be there , i have to catch you .
you don &apos;t have to catch me , dad .
yes , i do .
it &apos;s my job .
listen , if this works out between you and arizona ...
is there a chance that maybe you &apos;d , uh ...
give your mother a wedding ?
if arizona wanted to spend
the rest of her life with me ?
yeah , i &apos;ll put on a big white dress
and dance down the aisle .
how-- how about grandkids ?
yes , i would imagine ...
when the time came ...
there would be kids .
does she make you happy ?
yes , dad .
she makes me very happy .
i love you . you know that ?
she &apos;s not a vegetarian , is she ?
because i @-@ i don &apos;t know how much more i can take .
she &apos;s not a vegetarian .
i feel very old .
do you do what you &apos;re supposed to
and take your medicine ?
or do you learn to live with the thing ...
and hope someday it goes away ?
tell me everything . did you beat them ?
did you kick their asses ?
come on . i want a full report . everything that happened .
izzie left me .
she wrote a note and she left me .
i ... i don &apos;t--i don &apos;t--
i don &apos;t know if she &apos;s coming back .
wh @-@ what do you mean , she left ? where did she go ?
go hug him .
what ?
go hug him .
or do you just give up entirely
