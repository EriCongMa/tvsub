Welcome to the Williamsburg Diner.
Your lifespan just decreased by one meal.
Would you like to order now
or after that galaxy is destroyed?
Oh, dude, I can hold up one finger, too,
and trust me; it won't be that one.
Booth one is all yours.
If I wanted to deal with a guy
who won't even acknowledge my existence,
I'd track down my father.
Makeup needs to complement the personality.
Sorry, I wasn't listening.
Mr. Eye Queen's about to show me how to pluck my eyebrows.
Finally.
I've been telling you for a year you need to get plucked.
Pick up. Fried egg over easy.
Correction: make that over hard.
Max, that's Earl's order.
Can you?
You know, I could just check out
and phone in this job, too,
but I promised myself
I'd never grow up to be my gynecologist.
Earl, I know you remember a time
where people still made eye contact
and get the fact that I was totally dissing them.
It's a damn shame, Max.
Thank you, Earl.
The Mets are down in the bottom of the sixth.
Now you have one?
Earl, three months ago,
you thought T-Mobile was a rapper.
Max, I want to talk to you.
Well, why not?
Everyone else is listening to something tiny
and made in Asia.
I just heard the funniest joke.
A guy is driving a car up a hill
and he sees a pig in the road.
Wait. Oh yes, I forgot.
It's raining.
It's raining, and there is a pig.
I'm listening.
And then the pig is in the car--
no, the pig is in the road,
and--I'll be right back.
Thank you. Come again.
Hey, what do you want to do after work tonight?
Maybe we could go to that trendy new ice cream place
that only sells juice.
Nah, I'm too tired.
I've been on my feet since 2003.
Hi, can I get a red velvet--
Oh, my God, Max Black?
Oh, my God, Becky White?
Holy crap. How long has it been?
Let's see. When was I on "Intervention"?
访问其家庭成员 让他们说服主角同意接受帮助
Well, your hair's grown back on the right side,
so I'd say five years.
Hi, I'm Caroline.
I'd wait for Max to introduce me,
but she usually tells people
I'm Taylor Swift's slow cousin Randi.
Nice to meet you.
Max, I did not think you would still be alive.
I owe you $10.
Becky's an actress.
I just saw her in "Law and Order."
She owned "Deli worker who barely knew the victim."
Yeah, I've done three "Law and Orders."
Pretty easy work.
They usually find me in a trunk.
How do you two know each other?
Max and I waited tables together.
Well, mostly stood around and got drunk,
but they paid us.
Nice shop.
Looks like you guys have a business together too.
Too?
You two too?
We invented an Uber just for women.
Boober.
It would've been awesome,
except we didn't have an app...or a car.
Hey, forget about this cupcake.
I just got paid.
How about drinks on me?
And by drinks, I mean one PBR each.
I guess I could do drinks.
Do you mind closing up? Thanks.
I'll meet you out front.
Awesome.
Nice meeting you, Brandi.
It's Randi!
Hey, Earl, what's shaking?
Max, I'm pushing 80.
The easier question is, "What isn't shaking?"
Max, where were you last night?
I had to watch "Carson Daly" alone and say,
目前已1600多集
"This show's still on?" to no one.
I crashed on Becky's couch,
of which-- you're not gonna believe this--
she is the first owner.
So did you guys have fun last night,
or was it weird because you've grown apart?
Let's just say we're gonna be in not one,
but two wedding albums.
Becky can dance her some hora.
Fun.
That's so fun that you had fun.
Uh, what's happening here?
I guess I just thought we were...
Forget it.
Oh, no, please.
It's like watching a bird fly into a window in slow motion.
Well, you know, I thought we were exclusive,
for lack of a better word.
What, like monogamous?
You thought we were in a monogamous friendship?
I'm not even monogamous with the people I'm monogamous with.
What is the big deal?
You had friends before we were friends.
Bunch of rich bitches.
You guys talking about that show, "Friends"?
People always say, "Why was there no black friend?"
Because no reasonable black man
would hang out with those people.
He's been waiting to get that off his chest
since the mid-'90s.
You know what I just realized?
I've never tried to make friends as a not-rich person.
You made friends with me.
Against my will, but still.
Guess what I'm doing?
Motivating me to look at resumes on monster.com?
I'm gonna make a friend right now.
There's a girl in my section with clean-ish looking hair.
Speaking of hair, pick up.
Cobb salad.
Max, how's this for my friend-making smile?
Do you have more teeth than me?
Here's you salad. Dressing on the side.
I'm sort of a "DOS" gal myself.
Okay.
Thanks.
Maybe we should, I don't know, grab a couple salads sometime.
The Yelp review specifically said
I would be ignored by the waitstaff.
There's hair in your salad.
Excuse me.
The water's supposed to be that color.
No, no.
I just think it's cool how brave you were
to put yourself out there like that.
I haven't been called cool since I had a black card
and owned 3/4 of an island.
I'm Rachel. This is Kathy.
I'm Caroline,
and you have no idea how brave I am.
You should see where I shower.
She should come to our party.
She just moved to Williamsburg,
and we're having a party tomorrow.
You should come.
Oh, you know what?
I'm busy tomorrow night because I'm going to your party!
I've seen people with podcasts less desperate for approval.
Max, I had the most amazing night.
Me too. Becky just left.
She has to get up early tomorrow.
Not to brag, but she's playing a dead hooker
on "Blue Bloods."
Oh, so she came here for research.
Anyways, my new friends Rachel and Kathy
and everybody there were so warm and positive.
It was so refreshing to be around people
who were super driven and focused.
And we had such interesting conversations.
Honestly, after talking to them,
I felt like anything is possible.
Oh, you guys did molly?
Now I'm jealous.
These people don't need drugs to be happy.
Oh, so it's a cult.
How did you get cult from that?
You think the only way I can make friends
is by joining a cult?
No.
You could also always have gum.
In fact, they're so nice,
they invited you to come for the weekend.
Fresh country air.
No thanks.
Gorgeous views.
Not for me.
Free food and booze.
I could be in a cult for the weekend.
This place is amazing.
I know. Fancy.
And that was the first bus I've been on
where I didn't see an under-the-blanket handy.
I'm Topher. From the bus.
You were throwing sunflower seeds in my hair.
This is Lady Marmalade.
People named Topher shouldn't be allowed
to name other living things.
Please don't make fun of her.
She has seasonal depression.
We both do.
Hey, Caroline, I'm so glad you could come.
And you must be...
Starving.
Just give me the tray.
This is Max.
Thank you so much for inviting us.
Yeah, the last invitation we got was to audition for porn.
Less of an invitation;
more of a shout from a convertible.
"You girls want to do porn?"
Well, Elaine will be out in a minute,
so in the meantime, just be your awesome self.
Isn't she great?
So see? It's nice here.
And you thought it was a cult.
I also thought peanuts never touched the eggs at the diner,
but then that lady died.
Welcome, everyone.
Hi, Elaine.
There are only two rules in this house:
love one another
and don't talk to the neighbors.
I hate them.
I'm so glad you all could make it.
Oh, except Jerry.
He's getting LASIK.
He should've listened. I told him to eat more kale.
Kale is good for the eyes.
Okay.
Now make yourselves at home.
You mean don't pay our rent
and hide every time we hear someone in the hall?
Elaine, this is Caroline,
our new friend.
Hello, Caroline.
I've heard so many wonderful things.
And you are?
Looking for some dipping sauces.
I'm Max.
A lady who knows what she wants. I like that.
My ex-husband knew what he wanted:
to be a woman.
And now he is.
I miss her.
And all my shoes.
I hear you, sister.
But seriously, something like a honey mustard
or really anything in the Dijon world.
Whoo, she's a tough nut.
My favorite kind.
Except for cashews.
Max, Elaine is amazing.
Look around.
This is my new social circle.
This is the saddest circle I've seen
since my mom peed on the floor at Wal-Mart.
Can you just admit it's not a cult?
Everyone gather 'round.
Let's have some mutual eye contact.
That's nice. That's just being a person.
Look to the person next to you,
and open the door to them with your eyes.
Bitch, that door is locked.
Nicely done.
All right, everyone.
I'd like us to recite our mantra.
My best is my best, and that's why I'm blessed.
My best is my best,
and that's why I'm blessed.
Don't mumble, Connie.
My best is my best,
and that's why I'm blessed.
Okay, it's a cult.
Little bit.
My best is my best...
All right, everyone.
Let the sound of the bowls wash over you,
cleansing you from head to toe
and everywhere in-between.
These bowls got their work cut out for them.
Everyone, close your eyes and quiet the mind,
and receive the healing vibrations.
Sound bathe us, Eugene.
When you feel called to join the bowls,
begin with a soft...
I usually begin with a soft hummer.
How are we gonna get out of this?
Let's just call it what it is:
a cult.
I'm not going anywhere
until I see what's in those bowls.
I'm hoping for fettuccini.
I hope it's not fettuccini
because I really don't like cream-based sauces.
Do you mind?
This is important for Lady Marmalade.
She has fibromyalgia.
Fibromyalgia and seasonal depression?
You really won the dog lottery.
All right, everyone.
You may gently bring your energy
back into the room
whenever you feel ready.
We got to get out of here.
What are we gonna do? We're in the middle of nowhere.
You know what would save the day right now?
Boober.
Caroline.
Did anything come up for you during the sound bath?
A little bit of the chicken satay, but all good.
Max, how are you?
Were you touched at all?
In high school, I was touched by an angel.
Well, technically, his name was...
Angel.
I know this probably all seems like a lot of hooey,
but I assure you you'll wake up feeling refreshed.
And Eugene makes a hell of a pancake breakfast.
He uses ricotta.
We're staying.
I mean, ricotta? We gotta.
I guess so.
It'll be like staying at a B and B
run by a lame Ron Hubbard.
Goodnight, everyone.
Rachel has your room assignments.
Caroline, you're sharing a room with me.
Yay.
Max, you're sharing a room with Topher and Lady Marmalade.
Can I ever get a good roommate?
And do not fear.
Before the night is over, each of you will have a chance
to make love with me.
And the rest of the satay just came up.
Before the sunrise, our moons will unite.
Well, I'm guessing her moon's not waxed.
Caroline.
Caroline.
Caroline, where are you?
Caroline?
I thought you were gonna be Elaine...
and I'm not drunk enough for that!
By the way, the piglet's popping the snout out.
Oh, I thought you were gonna be Elaine.
And I thought I was gonna be dead at 14,
but you can't always get what you want.
Max!
Max, oh, my God. Are you okay?
Please tell me Elaine didn't get to you.
I could never live with myself.
Or you.
I'm sorry it took me so long to climax.
I know I was almost there for quite some time.
Max, Caroline, what are you doing out here?
We were just anxiously awaiting
intercourse with you.
Really?
'Cause unless that bag's full of marital aids,
it looks like you're trying to sneak out.
Look, Elaine,
this is all a lot, and no offense,
but you can't be the first person
I have sex with this year.
I understand that you're both feeling a little overwhelmed,
but before you go, why don't we discuss this as a group
in a healing way?
All right, Eugene, stay where you are.
You need some rest.
Maybe a little protein.
So you know what? We're just gonna go.
You can tell that guy at the door
he can just step aside so we can,
you know, start running.
Caroline, you are free to go at any time.
So we can go right now?
No.
Caroline, why don't you sit here, and Rachel,
bring Max over by the gong.
Siri, remind me to patent a gong bong.
Also remind me to get a phone with Siri.
Now, I know some of you have not yet laid with me tonight...
But it's come to my attention
that we have an N.N. in our midst.
What?
Who?
Quick Q on the N.N.
Do either of those Ns stand for nachos?
N.N. stands for Negative Nelly.
Negative Nancy was already trademarked
by another group run by my ex-husband, Nancy.
Caroline, do you have any idea who this N.N. could be?
I believe it's "whom" And no, I don't.
Caroline, are you where you want to be in life?
Oh, God, no.
And would you say there's someone holding you back?
Well, I do feel like
hearing about Amy Schumer every day
makes me feel a little "less than."
Caroline, is there someone in this room
who you brought with brown hair
whose Negative Nelly-ness
is blocking you in ways you don't even realize?
Wait a minute.
I'm starting to think this is about me.
Just having spent a few short hours with Max
and recording all your conversations...
It's pretty clear
that she is undermining your path to success
with her wisecracks and wordplay.
Look.
Max might seem negative, because she is,
but you would be, too, if you were her.
She's been neglected, rejected,
knocked down, and spat on.
Some of that was consensual.
See? That was positive.
So you will give up all these potential connections
just for her?
Caroline, I used to live in Jersey City,
and now I live in a better part of New Jersey.
Elaine, I thought I needed to make new friends,
and that's how I wound up here,
but turns out all I needed was Max.
I'll take my chances with her.
Huge mistake.
Huge.
Well, then you're free to go.
Just need to settle up your bill.
This weekend is only free for friends.
Rachel.
I ate $700 worth of shrimp?
That seems about right.
We can't pay that.
Is there a ship we can scrub?
Or a gay celebrity we can marry?
Don't worry. I'll settle up with Elaine.
Do you accept nature's credit card?
Get out.
I can't believe the only way I can make a friend
is to join a cult.
Well, you made friends with me, and I'm not in a cult...
anymore.
Max, are you and I gonna be like you and Becky someday?
Not unless one of us gets really, really,
I mean, so much cooler.
I'm serious.
Am I gonna be just some waitress you used to know?
'Cause that would kill me.
I don't think of you that way at all.
I mean as a waitress.
Look, yes, Becky and I worked together,
and yes, we had kind of a business dream, too,
but you and I have so much more than that.
You and I are about to die in the woods.
Look.
We are getting in that car
even if this guy has a hook for a hand.
Wazzup?
Hey, girls.
I never thought I'd be happy to see Oleg
on a dark road at night.
Sophie, what are you guys doing here?
Oh, well, Max texted me her location.
Said if I didn't hear back from her,
you'd been abducted by the cult and to come rescue you.
I was in a cult once.
It's called Avon.
So you were so certain I couldn't make a normal friend
you had an escape plan?
Hey, sometimes my negativity pays off.
Sometimes it gets me in mall jail.
