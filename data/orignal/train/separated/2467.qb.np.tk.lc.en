you have a mother ?
i had a mom . she died .
we loved her . she was our world .
our mother faked her death ,
left her sons behind ,
started a new family ,
and went out of her way to forget us forever !
who do you think gave kai the idea to put elena
in that sleeping beauty coma .
who ?
lily .
you chose your heretics over stefan and me
every chance you had .
please forgive me .
you &apos;re either a salvatore ,
or you &apos;re one of us .
you are wrong , julian .
lily !
damon .
say something .
you made your bed .
have a nice nap .
all she wanted was forgiveness ,
and you practically spat in her face .
she didn &apos;t deserve my forgiveness .
&quot; the phoenix stone gives the sword its power
against immortal foes . &quot;
when a vampire is stabbed through the heart ,
the sword acts as a magical conduit ,
transferring their spirit into this nasty stone .
the purpose of the stone is to punish vampires .
every sin you &apos;ve committed goes into
creating your own little personal hell .
stefan !
i don &apos;t know what your hell will be ,
but i hope she &apos;s there .
did you have a nice nap ?
mother ?
salvatore , help me !
henry !
please !
you must help me .
come .
we are getting you out of here .
hi there , hero .
you &apos;ve been out a long time .
mail call !
news from home ?
my brother .
dear damon ,
they tell us to only send good news , but i cannot .
the days grow darker in mystic falls
and my heart darker still .
valerie left and never came back ,
father drinks himself to sleep nightly .
as the anniversary of mother &apos;s night approaches ,
i find myself unable to sleep ,
paralyzed by a waking dread that i cannot shake
and dare not name .
i wish you were here , brother ,
to teach me how to survive these endless nights .
colonel , sir .
lieutenant salvatore .
i would like to request two weeks &apos; leave to go home , sir .
you and every man out here , salvatore .
no . request denied .
i fear my brother is in a very bad way , sir .
i would not ask if i did not believe
he truly needs me .
i do not wish to shirk my duties .
if there is something you need done , i shall do it .
anything ?
anything . yes , sir .
all right , then .
i &apos;ve got a mission .
honestly , it &apos;s more of a chore .
for a chance to see my brother ,
i will gladly accept it .
there &apos;s a farmhouse 12 miles to the east .
rumor is there are union sympathizers there
hiding confederate deserters .
now , if these rumors are true ,
i need those deserters arrested
and brought back to me .
consider it done .
thank you , sir .
thank you , sir .
two weeks at home ?
can you imagine ? how grand .
i cannot wait to see my girl olive .
she &apos;s a real peach .
you have a sweetheart , damon ?
no , but i have to see my brother .
damon , are you certain about this ?
about what , henry ?
about the mission .
these men ,
these deserters we are supposed to capture ,
they are just regular fellows who do not believe in the cause ,
like me , like you .
it is true .
i could give a damn about this war , henry .
to be honest , i only enlisted to please my father .
well , then how can you be fine
with rounding up men just like you ?
it is not my fault they deserted , henry .
they made their beds ,
but now they &apos;re our ticket home .
hello , ma &apos;am .
could you spare some dinner for two hungry soldiers ?
no . sorry .
i do not need to remind you
that quartering is your wartime duty ,
not to mention the law .
thank you , ma &apos;am .
hello .
we are your surprise dinner guests .
should i check the upstairs ?
yes , please .
henry here &apos;s going to freshen up .
clean hands , clean mind .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;re not one of those families
hiding munitions from the war effort ,
but orders being what they are ,
it is my duty to check .
i &apos;m glad to see someone takes the warning
about the devil and idle hands seriously .
we have a lot of fruit .
i see that , ma &apos;am .
no , no , no , no !
kindly lay your gun down .
i do not want any trouble .
if you turn around and go right now ,
you will find none .
all we want is is to go home .
see , that is the problem .
i want to go home , too .
oh , god !
oh , god .
damon ... what have we done ?
wait here .
please , enough blood has been shed .
lay down your weapon .
please .
mother ?
hello , damon .
you cannot be here .
you died of consumption .
we buried you in mystic falls .
oh , my sweet , sweet son .
i &apos;m dead , all right .
you saw to that .
you died . i was there .
this doesn &apos;t make any sense .
but it &apos;s starting to come back to you .
this isn &apos;t real .
your spirit is trapped inside the phoenix stone .
this really happened , didn &apos;t it ?
in 1863 .
i got a letter from stefan .
he seemed hopeless .
i just wanted to go home to him .
even though i had my doubts ,
i started to round up deserters .
it all went so wrong so fast .
did you ever take responsibility for the incident ?
what do you mean ?
you and henry covered it up
and never spoke of it again .
how do you know that ?
maybe it &apos;s time to give yourself up .
why ? for what ?
they were deserters . they ambushed us .
i didn &apos;t come here looking to kill anybody .
you had your reservations ,
but you still marched forward .
so hell is being raked over the coals
for something i haven &apos;t thought about in 150 years ?
sorry . you &apos;re gonna have to do a lot better than that .
the longer you keep your trauma at arm &apos;s length ,
the harder this is going to be for you .
i see ,
and this ptsd puppet show
wouldn &apos;t happen to be , by chance ,
a ploy to get me to be remorseful
for your pointless death ?
because it ain &apos;t working , mama .
this isn &apos;t about remorse , damon .
it &apos;s about punishment .
damon ?
please tell me you know who you are .
damon , say something .
i know who i am , bon bon .
good . means i actually got the spell right for once .
how do you feel ?
like i just spent a day in the life
of young damon salvatore .
a day ?
damon , you &apos;ve been dead for 3 months .
you sure you &apos;re ok ?
no desire to lash out or break anything ?
nope , but you don &apos;t look so good .
i &apos;m fine .
just , uh , weak .
it took 3 heretics to successfully
find julian &apos;s spirit in that stone ,
and i did it solo .
it &apos;s not that i was expecting a parade ,
but where &apos;s my parade ?
caroline &apos;s at whitmore ,
alaric &apos;s at a lecture , and matt &apos;s on patrol .
i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s been 3 months .
i--it &apos;s not like--
time stood still .
i get it . no offense taken .
where &apos;s stefan ?
you &apos;re gonna need another .
where is he , bonnie ?
when julian stabbed you ,
nora stabbed stefan ,
and i--i haven &apos;t been able to bring him back yet .
you &apos;re telling me my brother &apos;s still stuck in here
and you brought me out first ?
that didn &apos;t sound even like a glimmer of a thank you .
where is he , bonnie ?
he &apos;s in his bedroom .
we have to get him out .
i will when i can .
damon , it took all of my magic
just to pull you out .
i don &apos;t care , bonnie . now !
you store him in the closet ?
he was just in here .
well , he &apos;s not now , bonnie ,
which begs the question
how do you not see an unconscious vampire
walk out the front door ?
because he didn &apos;t walk out the front door .
someone took him .
if julian were in mystic falls , i think i &apos;d know .
don &apos;t you think you &apos;re giving yourself
a little too much credit there , donovan .
all i &apos;m saying is the guy &apos;s not shy
about making himself known .
matt , if julian scorches stefan &apos;s body ,
we can &apos;t get him back !
no one &apos;s scorching anyone , not yet .
listen . julian left a note .
he &apos;s clearly luring us somewhere for a reason , guys .
could always try a locator spell .
bonnie , no way !
you literally just dragged damon out of hell .
i can &apos;t even believe you &apos;re standing right now .
she wasn &apos;t talking to you , mama bear .
think you have enough juice ?
uh , i guess we could find out .
bonnie , you &apos;ve been exhausting yourself
every day for the last few months .
at least let me check the town surveillance tapes first .
you and who else ?
unless the mystic falls police department &apos;s had a hiring surge
since i was out .
i didn &apos;t think so .
can you find him ?
see what i can do .
drink ?
i &apos;m 28 weeks pregnant .
was that a yes or a no ?
what is it like inside your head ?
i &apos;m genuinely curious
because it must be wonderfully liberating
to only see what you want to see .
you know what i &apos;m curious about ?
why the phoenix stone
made my mother a character in my hellscape
when it had so many other options of torture to choose from .
and this is why i begged bonnie
to get stefan out first .
well , why didn &apos;t she ?
because logic prevailed .
what the hell &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
nothing .
blondie , you do not get to make this moment
the only time you ever decided to shut up .
tell me . what am i missing ?
look .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;ve just been through
or what it &apos;s like in that thing ,
but the longer that you are trapped ,
the more your humanity gets stripped away .
well , here i am all full of emotions .
the question is , why isn &apos;t my brother ?
because we figured if you were gone too long
you would come back devoid of humanity ,
hell @-@ bent on killing bonnie to revive elena .
god . bonnie ?
the spell worked .
he &apos;s on route 29 .
you go . i &apos;ll take care of her .
damon .
you &apos;re alive !
i was half expecting the , uh , cute witch
or the , uh , pregnant blond , but--
well , you &apos;re just gonna have to settle for the ornery brother .
right .
what &apos;s that putrid smell ?
that . yes .
see , i was at a petrol station earlier ,
and i got a little bit carried away with the nozzle .
i &apos;m afraid your brother is quite soaked .
come on . sit down .
if you &apos;re not gonna join me for the meal ,
i suppose i could just skip forward
to the after @-@ dinner smoke .
so do you want to talk about it ?
are we really doing this ?
yes , we &apos;re really doing this .
you know , i &apos;ve never had the opportunity
to share war stories with another stone survivor .
come on . how &apos;d you fare ?
tell me everything .
gladly . as soon as stefan &apos;s home ,
soul sucked out of that rock ,
we can all sit and pop open a bottle of chardonnay ,
chat , and eat bonbons till the sun comes up .
perhaps i should start .
see , upon waking up in that wretched world ,
i saw your mother ...
and then i killed her .
every day for over a century ,
i watched her die .
every day for over a century ,
i had my heart torn out of my chest .
oh , it was complete and utter misery .
i had a slightly different experience .
overall , i give hell one star for horror
and two very disappointed thumbs down
for clever use of parable .
so it didn &apos;t work on you ?
it was called hell .
let &apos;s just say i had expectations .
i think you simply resisted .
resisted what ?
no . no .
you resisted facing the pain
you so naturally and willfully push away .
no , stop it , stop !
damon !
it &apos;s too late .
no .
yes .
this isn &apos;t real .
the pain is real .
the feeling is real .
as soon as you figure that out ,
you &apos;ll be one step closer .
closer to what ?
closer to what ? !
hi there , hero .
you &apos;ve been out a long time .
mail call !
news from home ?
dear damon ,
they tell us to only send good news , but i cannot .
the days grow darker in mystic falls
and my heart darker still .
sir , w @-@ what would you say
if i asked for two weeks &apos; leave
to go see my brother .
you and every other man out here , salvatore .
no .
i thought so .
what if i was willing to help you
with your little deserter problem , for example ?
well , now that you mention it ,
there &apos;s a farmhouse about 12 miles east of here .
rumor is there are union sympathizers there .
i &apos;m on it .
just to get the rules clear--
i bring these deserters back alive ,
i go home to see my brother .
yes . yes , lieutenant .
all right , then .
two weeks at home ? how grand .
i cannot wait to see my girl olive .
she &apos;s a real peach .
you have a sweetheart , damon ?
yes . no . i mean--
i got to admit , things are a little fuzzy right now , henry .
these men ,
these deserters we are supposed to capture ,
aren &apos;t they are just regular fellows
like you and me ?
technically , yes ,
but i &apos;m starting to think
they stand for something much bigger now .
of course they do .
they are protesting on behalf of their political beliefs .
that they are , henry ,
but they &apos;re my ticket out of here ,
and i &apos;ve got to bring them back alive .
good day , ma &apos;am .
could you spare some dinner for two hungry soldiers ?
and before you say no ,
i &apos;d like to remind you that quartering
is the law in these parts .
i also love pie .
thank you kindly .
i &apos;ll go check the upstairs .
please do not .
but there could be people up there .
there aren &apos;t , henry .
granny , i &apos;m gonna have to kindly ask you set that knife down
and stand over here by the table , please .
please , ma &apos;am .
you , too , kid .
i &apos;m going to have to ask you all to stand here together
by the table .
damon , what are you doing ?
trust me . i got this .
no need . we won &apos;t get to dinner .
i know you &apos;ve got two deserters in the basement .
now , no one has to get hurt .
we are simply going to take these men to our camp ,
and that is that .
no .
don &apos;t !
no .
no , no , no .
well , that didn &apos;t go well .
damon ?
don &apos;t worry . i know who i am .
i also know you &apos;re not real .
what is that for ?
i &apos;m fine . i &apos;m just weak .
you know , it took 3 heretics to successfully
find julian &apos;s spirit in that stone .
you did it solo . got it .
good news is i know where julian &apos;s keeping stefan &apos;s body ,
so you can sit back , relax ,
and not have to worry about that locator spell .
what are you talking about ?
oh , right . spoiler alert .
when you were working on me ,
julian stole stefan &apos;s body .
i &apos;m gonna go get it back .
that won &apos;t be necessary .
you &apos;re not supposed to be here .
before you say anything ,
please don &apos;t hold it against caroline
for pulling me out first .
never even occurred to me .
so is this the part where we compare notes ,
analyze the symbolism ,
convince each other that we &apos;re survivors ?
well , to be honest with you ,
i just lived 168 years of mistakes , grief ,
and pain on a perpetual loop ,
so i &apos;m down to just skip to the part where we get drunk .
cheers .
cheers .
why ?
what happened to you in there ?
it was just a gruesome civil war saga .
confederate flags ,
carnage , lots of lives going kaput .
so it got to you , huh ?
some rock &apos;s obsession with my personal accountability
in a wartime tragedy ?
not particularly .
what ?
i mean , you didn &apos;t feel anything ?
of course .
i felt a burning desire to get home
to my sad sack of a brother
so i could help him get over a girl
he just met .
so the part with the innocent people
bleeding out all over the farmhouse floorboards ,
that--that did nothing for you ?
i knew it .
you knew what ?
you &apos;re not real .
sorry , brother . got to hit the reset button .
get your gun , henry .
w @-@ why ?
because i &apos;m starting to see a pattern ,
and you and i are gonna solve this little puzzle .
the spell &apos;s not working .
i don &apos;t understand .
it &apos;s like the stone is hiding his spirit .
then maybe you should take a break , all right ?
you been trying all day .
she can &apos;t . the longer he stays in there ,
the more damaged he &apos;ll be when he gets out .
and whose fault is that ?
you , of all people , don &apos;t get to lecture me .
it &apos;s ok .
we &apos;re all just a little bit stressed right now .
let &apos;s take a deep breath ,
and we can start again when bonnie &apos;s ready .
i don &apos;t get it .
we pulled stefan out no problem .
what &apos;s different now ?
because he &apos;s not ready yet .
when i was in there ,
i could barely remember who i was ,
and then i was hit with visions and tests ,
but the worst part of hell isn &apos;t what you &apos;re going through .
it &apos;s the sliver hope that you can actually get out on your own .
how come we had no trouble
reuniting your soul with your body ?
because eventually i submitted
to the kind of suffering that just breaks you .
knowing damon , he &apos;ll do anything he can
to avoid that kind of pain ,
which means we may never be able to get him out .
two weeks at home ?
i can &apos;t wait to see my girl olive .
bet she &apos;s a real peach ,
and , yes , henry , i have a girl .
she &apos;s in a sleeping beauty spell .
long story . so here &apos;s what i &apos;m thinking .
why today ?
out of all of damon salvatore &apos;s greatest hits ,
this farmhouse kerfuffle was barely a b @-@ side ,
and then i realized this is where it all began .
this was the first time i ever had blood on my hands .
i took that mission . i gave the order .
damon , i don &apos;t think you &apos;re well .
perhaps your fever is back . maybe we should turn around .
i &apos;m not sick , henry .
the point is is that the weeks after the farmhouse massacre
when i was crushed by guilt and self @-@ loathing ,
do you know the one person in the world that i wanted to talk to ?
my brother .
that has to be the solution to this hell puzzle , too .
we find a way to get to stefan .
we stop reliving this day over and over and over again .
does that make sense ?
we are returning to camp . i insist . you are not yourself .
do you want leave to see your peach of a sweetheart ?
do you , henry ?
then follow my lead , wattles .
i &apos;m gonna get this right .
hello , beautiful . what a great smile you have .
i &apos;m gonna need you , your daughter , and grandma
to come out here on the porch with private wattles ,
soldier &apos;s orders .
come on out , ladies . that &apos;s right . thank you .
right here , just right there on the porch .
very nice .
stay on the porch . it &apos;s a nice day .
i know you &apos;re down there .
i need you to toss out your weapons on the count of 3,
or i will kill your host family .
1 ...
2 ...
3 .
that &apos;s good .
now come out one at a time arms raised .
ok . ok .
hi there , hero .
you &apos;ve been out a long time .
let &apos;s try this again .
ok . i know you have a grenade .
this time ,
i need you to gently slide the grenade out to me first .
next , i want your revolvers ,
and i want all this on the count of 3,
or i kill your host family .
1 ...
2 ...
3 !
now come out one at a time arms raised .
arms raised .
damon ...
i &apos;m really starting to hate you 3 .
hi there , hero .
you &apos;ve been out a long time .
mail call !
news from home ?
what did you go and do that for ?
stefan , never write me again .
mail !
hi there , hero . you &apos;ve been out a long time .
and if you bring the deserters back to me ,
then you shall have your leave , salvatore .
does the offer still stand if i bring them back dead ?
hi there , hero . you &apos;ve been out a long time .
mail call !
screw this .
damon , where are you going ?
you know what the shortest distance
between point &quot; a &quot; and point &quot; b &quot; is , henry ?
what ?
a straight line .
to get out of this hell , i got to see my brother ,
so i &apos;m going straight to him .
i &apos;m deserting to mystic falls .
really ? can i come with you ?
you know how you always say i &apos;m a hero , henry ?
i &apos;m no hero .
grenade !
no way .
come in . we &apos;ve been expecting you .
well , this is different . where the hell is everybody ?
keep your voice down .
i can see them coming in the distance .
who ?
confederates are hunting deserters .
they will kill you .
you need to hide in the cellar .
ok . this whole urgency thing isn &apos;t necessary
because this isn &apos;t actually happening .
damon , you are not hearing me .
they are here . get down to the cellar if you want to live .
brother .
well , well .
if it isn &apos;t the light at the end of the tunnel .
pretty dark tunnel , this little slaughterhouse .
i can see why you never told me about it .
was trying to protect your fragile emotions , stefan .
you &apos;re the reason i took the mission to begin with .
you always have a reason , don &apos;t you , damon ?
brother , drinking buddy ...
her .
elena ?
you &apos;re gonna have to do a lot better than that .
proving that i do bad things for the people that i love ?
this isn &apos;t about what you do in her name , damon .
it &apos;s about what you do in her absence .
quiet . they &apos;re here .
what the hell is going on ?
you don &apos;t get it , do you ?
you tell yourself that you &apos;re protecting mystic falls for elena .
you convince yourself
that you &apos;re keeping her safe by any means necessary .
you justify punishing lily for elena &apos;s sake .
did you ever once think , &quot; what would elena do ? &quot;
i never got a chance to ask her , thanks to lily .
ah , so you had to ask .
is elena &apos;s influence on you so weak
that you can &apos;t tell right from wrong
without her holding your hand ?
where are you hiding him ?
it &apos;s gonna be a long century , brother .
you know , i wonder if
she &apos;ll even recognize you when she wakes up--
what ?
the man who spit on our mother &apos;s grave ,
the man who lies to himself even now
about what happened here today ?
what are you talking about ?
put your hands off of me ...
colonel stop . stop !
no .
she &apos;s gone !
what are you doing to me ?
the mission went sideways .
innocents died and you walking away with blood on your hands .
what did you want ?
i wanted my brother .
what did you want ?
my brother .
what did you want ?
i wanted my brother .
stop lying to yourself .
who did you want in that moment
before you buried all your secrets ,
before you learned how to hide from your pain ?
i--
i wanted ...
my mother .
well , it &apos;s too late .
damon , damon , can you move ?
please . please . you must help me .
damon , damon , can you move ?
please . please . you must help me .
why ? this isn &apos;t real .
pain is real . feeling is real .
you love this , don &apos;t you ?
i &apos;m gonna die knowing my own son hates me .
yes . he does .
why ?
because you tried to take elena away from me .
why won &apos;t you help me ?
please . oh !
why ?
because you took the one thing that made me happy ,
because you weren &apos;t
strong enough to leave your husband ,
because you got sick and left us ,
because you never came back .
i hate you because you could &apos;ve come back so many times ,
but you never did .
i lost you the first time
when father sent you away with consumption ,
and then we brought you back from this prison world ,
and then i lost you again to your other family ,
and now i &apos;m losing you to death .
3 times i lost you .
3 times i had the chance
to tell you everything i want to tell you ,
and 3 times i ruined it .
oh , my-- my sweet boy ...
there &apos;s still time .
tell me . tell me what you want to say .
tell me .
mom , i &apos;m so sorry .
i &apos;m so sorry .
give me a chance
to make it right .
give me a chance to let you love me , ok ?
no .
no .
no .
no .
no .
no .
no .
we weren &apos;t done .
i got to get her back . i got to get her back .
damon , damon , damon , damon .
hey , it &apos;s me . it &apos;s me . you &apos;re safe .
it &apos;s ok . it &apos;s ok .
no . no . one more time . one more time .
send me back . i know what do to now .
damon , it &apos;s not real .
i know it &apos;s not real . none of this is real !
damon ! damon , don &apos;t !
damon !
damon-- agh ...
i have to get back to her .
why am i still here ?
it wasn &apos;t real . this isn &apos;t real .
