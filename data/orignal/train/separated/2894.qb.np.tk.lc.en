the reason i asked you to brunch ...
... is because i &apos;ve been thinking about my maid of honor .
oh , my god . this is it . oh .
i hope it &apos;s you .
i hope it &apos;s you .
me too .
first of all , i love you both so much .
you &apos;re both so important to me .
blah , blah , blah . who is it ?
i was thinking we could come up with a system ...
... where we trade off being maid of honor .
hypothetically , if phoebe were mine ...
yes ! oh .
hypothetically .
still .
if phoebe were mine.rachel would be phoebe &apos;s , i &apos;d be rachel &apos;s .
we all get to do it and no one gets upset .
that &apos;s a pretty good idea .
i &apos;ll do that . so , who &apos;s yours ?
well , that &apos;s the best part . you guys get to decide .
why is that the best part ?
i don &apos;t have to .
of course we &apos;ll help you decide . we &apos;ll do anything we can to help you .
i &apos;d like to make a toast .
to the future mrs. chandler bing ...
... my best friend and truly one of the nicest people that ...
really not deciding .
fine .
excuse me , i couldn &apos;t help overhearing .
you &apos;re marrying chandler bing ?
yeah .
good luck !
oh , and good luck to you too !
what a nice lady .
the one with nap partners
yeah !
die hard , still great .
yep .
let &apos;s make it a double feature ?
what else you rent ?
die hard 2 .
joey , this is die hard 1 again .
well , we &apos;ll watch it a second time and it &apos;s die hard 2 .
joey , we just saw it .
and ?
it would be cool to see it again !
yeah ! die hard !
die hard !
dude , you didn &apos;t say die hard .
is everything okay ?
yeah , i just got plans .
well , john mcclane had plans .
i want to leave before joey gets all worked up ...
... and starts calling everybody &quot; bitch . &quot;
what are you talking about , bitch ?
hey , rachel .
yeah ?
when i get married , will you be my maid of honor ?
really ?
oh , my god , phoebe . i mean , i &apos;m just ...
wait a minute .
if i &apos;m your maid of honor , that means that you are monica &apos;s .
oh .
well , if that &apos;s what you want .
no way , phoebe . i want to be monica &apos;s .
why does it even matter ?
why does it matter to you ?
because this one is now .
and it &apos;s two of our best friends .
and who knows what you &apos;re gonna marry .
what if i marry ross ? or joey ?
you wouldn &apos;t .
okay , look , rachel . i know you really want to do this ...
... but i &apos;ve never been maid of honor to anyone before .
i know you &apos;ve done it at least twice .
yeah , but phoebe ...
please let me finish .
i guess that was it .
okay .
since you &apos;ve never done it before , you can be monica &apos;s maid of honor .
oh , thank you so much !
yay .
i &apos;m gonna marry someone good .
oh , i know .
better than chandler .
what happened ?
i don &apos;t know .
we fell asleep . that is all .
yeah . yeah ? yeah .
all right , well , i &apos;d better go .
i think that would be best .
yeah .
i &apos;ll talk to you later .
okay .
but not about this .
no , never . never !
bye .
no touch . no touch .
die hard !
opening a topless carwash was a great idea .
we &apos;ll definitely have enough money to open our bikini shop .
now we mince the shallots like this .
look , honey , the nice people are chopping shallots .
maybe if they chop enough of them , they can open that bikini shot .
hey , a weird thing happened at brunch .
this woman overheard that i was marrying you ...
... and she wished me good luck .
that &apos;s sweet .
no , it was more like a &quot; good luck . &quot;
well , do you think she meant , &quot; good luck taming that wild stallion . &quot;
not judging you , a little gay .
so , what did this woman look like ?
she was , like , 30 , dark hair , attractive .
any chance you were looking into a bright , shiny thing called a mirror ?
was it someone you dated in college ?
no , i only dated two girls in college ...
... both blond , both not attractive .
let me check this out .
what are you doing ?
well , let &apos;s see .
okay , is that her ?
oh , my god , yes !
who is she ?
julie graff , my camp girlfriend .
did you break up with her ?
no , we &apos;re still together .
we went out for two summers and then i broke up with her .
why ?
she came back the third summer ...
... and she &apos;d gotten really fa ...
fat ?
i did not say fat .
i said fa ...
you broke up with a girl because she was fat ?
yeah . yeah .
but it was a really long time ago . does she still feel bad ?
apparently she does .
you know what they say : &quot; elephants never forget . &quot;
seriously , good luck marrying me .
rach , wanna come with me friday night ? i &apos;m gonna check out some male strippers .
for the bachelorette party ?
yes .
hey , what &apos;s going on ?
she &apos;s monica &apos;s maid of honor .
hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that girl downstairs .
you have been maid of honor before ?
you see ? this is exactly why you shouldn &apos;t lie .
that &apos;s it . i am maid of honor .
no , i am .
how come you are ?
because i cared enough to lie .
hey , i could help you decide who should do it .
we could have an audition .
see how you &apos;d handle maid @-@ of @-@ honor @-@ type situations .
what do you mean ?
when i want a job ...
... i audition and if i &apos;m the best of the people they see ...
... i get the part .
then they send you a script . you go to the set .
you rehearse and you have wardrobe fittings .
then you shoot your part . and it &apos;s great .
but right after that , you &apos;re back out on the street looking for work again .
right back where you started .
so i gotta say , i don &apos;t think a career in acting is the right choice for you two .
joey , the maid of honor thing .
right .
so , okay , so after this audition , who decides who gets it ?
oh , me and ross can be the judges .
it &apos;s better than us deciding .
oh , this is crazy .
can &apos;t we just flip a coin ?
no , coins hate me .
okay , fine . you know what ? we will let ross and joey decide .
hi !
ross , sweetie .
hey there , handsome thing .
wow , this cologne really is every bit as good as giorgio .
hey .
just brought back your videos .
hey , ross . look , i think we need to talk about before .
no . no , we don &apos;t .
yes , we do .
now , look . that was the best nap i ever had .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
come on , admit it .
that was the best nap you ever had .
i &apos;ve had better .
okay . when ?
all right ! all right ! it was the best nap ever !
i said it , okay ?
but it &apos;s over , joey !
i want to do it again .
we can &apos;t do it again .
why not ?
because it &apos;s weird !
fine .
you want a drink ?
sure . what do you got ?
warm milk and excedrin pm .
chandler .
i just figured out who you are .
can you figure out what i &apos;m doing ?
you &apos;re louis posen .
who ?
he was my best friend in fifth grade .
one day , i asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no .
do you know why ?
because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom ?
no , but because he thought i was too fa ...
every time i think about it , i feel as bad as i did then .
i really think you should apologize to julie .
honey , are you kidding ? that was like 16 years ago .
it would make me feel better if louis apologized to me .
i &apos;ll do it . but i warn you , this may make me a better person .
and that is not the man you fell in love with .
i can live with that .
okay .
so how do we find her .
she probably lives in the city .
she was eating in that restaurant .
i &apos;ll bet she was .
what is wrong with me ?
okay , we &apos;ll give you hypothetical maid @-@ of @-@ honor situations .
you &apos;ll be scored on a scale of one to ten .
one being the highest .
ten is the highest .
why is 10 the highest ?
because it &apos;s the highest .
okay , rachel , you &apos;re up first .
situation number one : you &apos;re with monica .
the wedding is about to start when monica gets cold feet . go !
i don &apos;t want to marry chandler .
i &apos;ve got cold feet .
it &apos;s gonna be okay .
one man the rest of my life ? i don &apos;t know .
this means i &apos;ll never get to sleep with joey .
look , monica ...
... getting cold feet is very common .
it &apos;s just because of all the anticipation .
and you just have to remember that you love chandler .
and also , i ran out on a wedding .
you don &apos;t get to keep the gifts .
drawing on your own experience .
very good .
yes , very nice , rachel .
thank you , judges .
kiss ass .
oh .
okay , phoebe .
yes , your honor .
we &apos;re now in the ceremony .
monica is about to say , &quot; i do ... &quot;
... when her drunk uncle starts yelling .
what do you do ? go !
when monica was a little girl ...
... i remember that ...
ow !
very good !
oh .
yes , excellent . perfect score .
she just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony !
hey , you want a little taste of pheebs ?
ladies , please . please .
okay , the next situation is for rachel .
the wedding is about to start .
you walk into the back room and you find monica taking a nap with ross .
i &apos;ll be monica . go !
no , no , no !
this situation is not sanctioned !
now , we &apos;re moving on to the next one .
okay .
it is time for you to give your maid @-@ of @-@ honor speech .
we haven &apos;t even prepared ...
go !
okay , okay , okay .
webster &apos;s dictionary defines marriage as ...
okay , no ! forget that ! that sucks ! okay , never mind . forget it .
i met ... i met monica when we were just a couple of 6 @-@ year @-@ olds ...
... and became friends with chandler when he was 25 ...
... although he seemed like a 6 @-@ year @-@ old .
oh .
thank you . thank you very much .
i &apos;ve known them separately and together .
to know them as a couple is to know that you are in the presence of love .
so i would like to raise my glass ...
... to monica and chandler ...
... and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together .
i can think of no two people better prepared for the journey .
wow .
great speech .
yeah , it really was .
oh , thanks .
okay , phoebe , i guess you &apos;re next . although i really don &apos;t see the point .
okay .
i can &apos;t believe that monica and chandler are getting married .
i remember talking about this day with rachel ...
... while we were showering together , naked .
and she &apos;s back in the game !
julie . hi .
chandler bing . i guess you remember me .
hello , skidmark .
it &apos;s a nickname . i &apos;ll explain later .
it &apos;s pretty clear .
i owe you a long , overdue apology .
i shouldn &apos;t have broken up with you because of your weight .
that &apos;s why you broke up with me ?
you didn &apos;t know that ?
well , i guess my work here is done .
can i get you guys something to drink while you tabulate ?
actually , the final vote has been tallied .
i &apos;ll take a cocoa .
too late .
but first of all , i would like to say you both performed very well , okay ?
you should be proud .
and i &apos;d also like to say , in this competition , there are no losers .
well , except rachel . damn it !
really ? i won .
what ?
i &apos;m sorry , rach , it was really close .
well , then i demand a recount !
actually , it wasn &apos;t that close .
you know what ? your thing was so stupid anyway .
we &apos;re gonna flip a coin , all right ?
heads .
what ? the coins have finally forgiven me !
know what ? i hope monica forgives you after you throw her ...
... vegetarian @-@ voodoo @-@ goddess @-@ circle @-@ y shower .
rach , it &apos;s gonna be okay . you guys are the best !
boy , i tell you . that judging stuff took a lot out of me .
yeah ?
yeah .
thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch .
why would i care about that ?
no reason . i &apos;m just saying that ...
... that &apos;s where i &apos;ll be .
as bad as that went , i actually enjoyed myself .
i think that i &apos;m going to apologize for all the stupid things that i do .
why don &apos;t you just stop doing stupid things ?
then you wouldn &apos;t have to apologize .
i &apos;d love it if i could do both .
all right , i have to ask .
what ?
will you break up with me if i get fat ?
what ?
you broke up with julie . how much weight did she gain ?
a hundred and forty @-@ five pounds .
in one year ?
my god , what did she eat ? her family ?
that &apos;s not the point .
i know it was a stupid reason to break up with someone , but i was 15 .
yeah , well , that &apos;s not the only time this was an issue .
you remember when you spent thanksgiving with us ?
you called me fat .
wait a minute .
that was totally different .
how ?
you were not supposed to hear that . i said that behind your back .
what if i have babies , okay ? i &apos;m gonna look different .
i &apos;m okay with that , but i &apos;m not sure you are .
you have to realize i don &apos;t think of you as a thin , beautiful woman .
this is one of the things that i can apologize for later .
what i mean is , you &apos;re monica .
okay ? and i am in love with monica .
keep going .
so you can balloon up or you can shrink down ...
... and i will still love you .
even if i were to shrink down to 2 inches tall ?
i &apos;d carry you around in my pocket .
i love you .
skidmark still got a way with the ladies .
hi , pheebs .
hi .
hi .
i just want to apologize .
i &apos;m really sorry i was a baby .
that &apos;s ridiculous . rachel , we were all babies once .
oh , you mean today . yeah .
yeah , and you know , you deserve to win .
and i was thinking about it .
if you &apos;re monica &apos;s maid of honor , i get to be yours .
oh , yeah .
yeah .
when monica and chandler got engaged , i put some stuff together .
just in case .
oh , that &apos;s so sweet . thanks .
here is a book of poetry that i know monica loves .
oh , god , this is funny . look .
here &apos;s a picture from one halloween where she dressed up as a bride .
she made me carry her train ...
... which was weird because i was wonder woman .
oh , and here &apos;s a little purse that i found .
i just thought they could hold the rings in there .
oh .
something . and ...
... vintage handkerchiefs , you know , because people cry at weddings .
i &apos;m just gonna grab a couple of these .
this stuff is great .
i forgot this was in here .
this was the garter that i was saving for my wedding .
and i wanted it to be monica &apos;s &quot; something borrowed . &quot;
and it &apos;s blue .
rach , i think that you should be monica &apos;s maid of honor .
you do ?
why ?
because i think it means more to you .
but , pheebs , honey , you earned it .
it &apos;s fine . i mean , this is something ...
... that you &apos;ve been thinking about since you were , what , 14 ?
no , i was 10 . i just developed early .
man alive !
hey , what &apos;s going on ?
hey !
we decided rachel is going to be your maid of honor .
oh , that &apos;s great !
oh , wow . okay , we really have to start planning .
i have really specific ideas .
we should meet four times a week .
come to my place , we &apos;ll get together before work .
what do you say , 6 : 30 , my place ? so excited !
yeah , okay . you laugh now .
she &apos;s gonna be yours .
great nap .
it really was .
what the hell are you doing ?
god !
