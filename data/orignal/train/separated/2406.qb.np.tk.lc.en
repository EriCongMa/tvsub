my name is elena gilbert .
i &apos;m a new vampire , and there have been complications .
i know that i &apos;m sired to you , damon .
you know what would make me happy ?
that what you actually felt for me was real .
but there &apos;s hope now . there &apos;s a cure .
this cure has ruined us ,
and it hasn &apos;t even been found yet .
what do you know about silas ?
he &apos;s the world &apos;s first immortal being ,
who just happens to be the person with the cure .
unlikely alliances have formed .
what the hell are you doing here ?
how can i help ?
no feelings . no attachment .
and someone will stop at nothing
to make sure we never find the cure .
you &apos;re going to find jeremy gilbert ,
and you &apos;re going to kill him .
kol compelled damon to kill you .
you &apos;re gonna kill kol instead .
leaving so soon .
it &apos;s my place , nik .
i don &apos;t appreciate you invading my privacy
like some kind of creeping tom .
i apologize for breaking up
this sordid little tryst ,
but i do have some urgent business .
or have you forgotten that our paranoid brother kol
is running around with a white oak stake
and homicide on the brain ?
he tried to kill me last night . i didn &apos;t forget .
yes . unfortunately ,
he seems to have absconded with my set of daggers .
poor nik . however will you get your way
without your precious daggers ?
they were so handy when you wanted to end a conversation
with one of us .
kol &apos;s irrational fear of silas
has pushed him off the edge .
we need to put him down before he does any more damage .
now , i know you have the last dagger ,
and i know you have some white ash , so hand it over .
and leave myself unprotected ?
you can file that request under &quot; no chance in hell . &quot;
be gone by the time i &apos;ve showered .
lurkers aren &apos;t welcome here .
i need that dagger , stefan .
talk some sense into her .
why don &apos;t you talk some sense into her ?
i &apos;m headed home to play prison guard to damon .
he &apos;s on lockdown ever since kol compelled him
to kill jeremy last night .
you see ? that &apos;s my point exactly .
if you let kol run free ,
then jeremy won &apos;t live to see his junior prom ,
and we can kiss our map to the cure good @-@ bye .
but if you help me dagger kol ,
damon will be uncompelled ,
jeremy will live ,
and we &apos;ll all be on our merry way
to a human elena .
where are you ?
i told caroline i &apos;d take her place
at decade dance prep , but none of the rest of you showed .
i know . i &apos;m sorry . i had to , though .
i &apos;ve got jeremy under house arrest
because kol wants to kill him .
and klaus wants to take him
on some vampire @-@ slaying road trip .
and since neither of them were invited in ,
it &apos;s the only place that i can keep him safe .
why does it sound like you &apos;re under fire ?
apparently i &apos;m living in a fraternity house now .
i &apos;m training .
me , too .
train yourself to do some dishes .
and put these weapons away
before someone tries to use one on me .
it &apos;s hard for me to look forward to this dance
while you &apos;re trapped in your house .
listen , i have a plan to put an end to all of this .
i want jeremy to kill kol .
you want him to kill an original ?
think about it .
kol &apos;s sire line must stretch to the moon by now .
if jeremy kills kol ,
every vampire that he &apos;s ever turned ,
not to mention everyone that they &apos;ve turned , will die ,
which means the hunter &apos;s mark will be complete ,
and we &apos;ll have our key to finding the cure .
i &apos;m on my way . we &apos;ll figure it out .
do you think caroline will notice
if there &apos;s only 89 red balloons ?
actually , probably yes .
elena .
sorry .
what happened ?
i don &apos;t know .
there &apos;s something in the water .
are you serious ?
you dumped vervain into the water supply ?
where did you even get it ?
i have my sources .
i &apos;m also reinstating the curfew
and canceling all town events .
dad , there &apos;s the dance tonight .
not anymore .
are you serious ?
honey , i &apos;m trying to protect you , not punish you .
the well @-@ being of this town is my job now .
no . dad , it &apos;s mine , and i &apos;ve been doing fine
without you getting involved .
you &apos;ve been doing fine ?
would you like me to read you
all the names of the people that have gone missing
or died in tragic accidents in your senior year alone ?
head straight home , please . we &apos;re having a family meeting .
no one can get to the cure
if you &apos;re too dead to find it .
you &apos;ve come to snap my neck again ?
because i woke up feeling completely unmurderous ,
and i &apos;m pretty sure that it &apos;s safe to set me free .
oh man , really ?
you practically bled me dry .
at least spring for a bag or something .
i &apos;m thirsty .
exactaly what i had in mind .
hello , mate .
what the hell are you doing here ?
babysitting .
give him a vial of blood every couple of hours
so he doesn &apos;t desiccate .
if he gets too much strength back
or if he just annoys you ,
bleed him out again .
silent treatment , huh ?
is that your best shot ?
he &apos;s still pissed at me for sleeping with elena .
are you sure about that ?
because i caught him trying to sneak out
of rebekah &apos;s bed this morning ,
which would suggest to me that he &apos;s moved on .
well , well . looks like my brother
ripped out a page of my revenge sex handbook .
well , why don &apos;t you two enjoy your little , uh ,
villain bonding time ?
i &apos;ll let you know when i get the dagger from rebekah .
damon is fine .
i locked him with all the creature comforts he deserves .
that &apos;s not why i called .
kol just tried to kill bonnie .
what ? is she ok ?
yeah , just shaken up .
she managed to hold him off , but kol seems pretty intent
on murdering anyone who &apos;s looking for that cure .
yeah . klaus has me trying to convince rebekah
to give up her dagger so we can take care of kol .
i don &apos;t want to just dagger kol .
i want jeremy to kill him .
what did you just say ?
bonnie says she &apos;s got all this crazy new power .
she thinks she can hold him long enough
for jeremy to get a clean shot .
and then what , huh ?
klaus and rebekah will kill every single one of us
out of spite .
they may be dysfunctional , bickering lunatics ,
but they stick together no matter what .
that &apos;s why you need to find the dagger
and use it on rebekah .
she can &apos;t come looking for revenge if she &apos;s lying in a box .
yeah , i can &apos;t do that .
i know you can &apos;t because vampires can &apos;t use the dagger ,
but matt can .
it &apos;s not like she doesn &apos;t deserve it .
and bonnie thinks that she can get klaus out of the picture , too ,
at least temporarily .
once we get this cure , none of this will matter
because we can use it against them .
all right , fine , but how do you plan to lure kol in ?
jeremy gilbert .
nice to see i &apos;m still on your speed dial , mate .
hey , you want to meet up at the batting cages in denver ?
actually , it &apos;s elena gilbert .
what a treat .
yeah , i was just thinking of all the clever ways
i could have your brother killed ,
but i &apos;d settle for ripping off
his illustrated arm instead .
i need to talk to you--in person .
i want to call a truce in the name of silas .
you want to talk about silas ?
i &apos;ll meet you wherever you want .
i &apos;ll come to you .
i &apos;ll tell you what .
how about i come to you ?
if you want to truce ,
open the door and invite me in .
i &apos;m waiting .
let me in , and let &apos;s talk truce .
wouldn &apos;t it be kind of stupid to invite you in ?
on the contrary .
i can &apos;t kill your brother with my own two hands ,
or i &apos;ll suffer the hunter &apos;s curse
and spend the next 20 years trying to off myself in gruesome ways .
and i heard that vervain is back in town
so i can &apos;t compel you to kill him either .
so i think it &apos;s fair to say
you &apos;re semi @-@ safe , for now .
i &apos;m the only one that could invite him inside .
he &apos;s right , obviously .
you &apos;d think being alive for over 1,000 years
would teach me some manners ,
but i couldn &apos;t resist stopping by .
if i let you in , my brother goes .
you &apos;re not getting near him .
fair enough .
you can come in .
no gold medal in bravery , i see .
another thing i love about the modern age is
music anytime you like .
so , it &apos;s the part you offer me a drink
so we can have a proper chat .
colours are fabric , the eighties were just tragic .
you know , i think shoulder pads
rival 17th @-@ century puritan smocks for crimes against fashion .
looking for something to wear to the dance ?
aye . are you asking me to a date ?
actually , it was canceled .
so why are you here ?
back for more dagger talk ?
somebody has some trust issues .
it &apos;s called a healthy skepticism .
i know you were trying to sneak out this morning .
i &apos;m not stupid .
sorry .
i &apos;m still trying to get used to this .
do you regret it ?
no .
do you want it to happen again ?
maybe .
even if i don &apos;t give you the dagger ?
you think that i would sleep with you
just to get the dagger ?
don &apos;t give me that innocent look .
you &apos;ve done plenty to me
in the name of getting what you want .
well , i guess i should pack up these racks .
just another failed attempt at getting to a high @-@ school dance .
why do you care so much about high @-@ school dance ?
i don &apos;t . i was just bored .
right .
we can also go , if you want .
not if it &apos;s canceled , we can &apos;t .
since when do you care about the rules ?
you know , none of this would be an issue
if you &apos;d have just done your job properly .
i was perfectly willing to let you train jeremy .
no , you weren &apos;t . are you kidding ?
you got there on day two .
do you know how hard it is to get
these x @-@ box brains to focus ?
and then when i turned a room full of barflies
into vampires for him to slaughter ,
you let kol kill them .
your brother problem , not mine , buddy .
and whose bright idea was it
to saddle jeremy with a conscience , hmm ?
well , we couldn &apos;t have him trying to stake elena
in her sleep , now , could we ?
ah , yes , for the love of elena .
how is it that she manages to overlook
every horrific thing you &apos;ve ever done ?
is it willful ignorance
or perhaps something more pathological ?
some people are just more capable
of forgiveness than others .
bet you score about a negative 500 in that realm .
come on . there must be a secret .
it can &apos;t just be the sire bond . what is it ?
compulsion ?
manipulation ?
what did you say to her ?
i think this has something to do
with a certain blond vampire .
i think you murdered carol lockwood ,
and i think you &apos;re worried
that caroline &apos;s never going to forgive you .
you &apos;ve done worse .
debatable . see , i don &apos;t mind being the bad guy ,
because somebody has to fill that role and get things done .
you do bad things for no reason .
you do them to be a dick .
debatable .
if you &apos;re gonna be bad , be bad with purpose .
otherwise you &apos;re just not worth forgiving .
sorry , and dig up your people &apos;s alcohol .
yeah , that &apos;s the problem with people today .
they have no drinking imagination .
turn of the century new orleans ,
now , they knew how to make a drink .
you lived in new orleans ?
we all did ,
till niklaus shoved a dagger in my heart .
why ? what did you do ?
what makes you think i did anything ?
has your alliance with my brother
softened you to his horrors ?
i don &apos;t have an alliance with klaus .
we had a mutual interest in finding the cure . that &apos;s all .
had ?
yes .
and i &apos;m willing to give up looking for it
if you promise to leave my brother alone .
now can you teach me how to make this ?
ok , i &apos;ll get some ice .
杰里米 : 设法找她 拖住科尔
bonnie , where are you ? i &apos;ve called , like , 17 times .
kol is in our house . we need you .
ok , i &apos;m headed to your house now .
here you go .
would you like one ?
sure . why not ?
you are really good at that game .
especially considering you &apos;ve been locked up in a coffin
for a hundred years .
i &apos;m a quick learner . speedy reflexes .
it &apos;s not much like the real thing , though , is it ?
you have killed , haven &apos;t you ?
or are you one of those mary sue vampires ?
i killed once .
i &apos;m guessing your number is a lot higher than mine .
you lose track over the years .
so are we going to talk about silas
or just jibber jabber ?
no one else seems to think silas exists .
so why do you ?
i used to run with some witches
in africa in the 14th century ,
haiti in the 17th century ,
new orleans in the 1900s .
they all knew about silas
and that he needed to stay buried .
i actually hold witches in high esteem .
yeah , but why silas ?
why are you so afraid of him ?
they said if silas rises ,
he &apos;ll unleash hell on earth .
i happen to like earth just the way it is .
that &apos;s pretty biblical .
well , that &apos;s the other problem with people today .
they &apos;ve lost faith ,
and in that loss , they no longer know who they should fear .
i have to get to elena .
have you seen my phone ?
i &apos;ve got your phone , and i &apos;ve got your car keys .
and i told you we are having a family meeting .
is that something you read in a book ?
because we have never had a family meeting .
i &apos;ve let this go on long enough .
shane said you and your magic are like a ticking time bomb .
and i told you he &apos;s crazy .
i lost your mother to witchcraft .
i don &apos;t intend to lose you .
it &apos;s not your life . it &apos;s mine .
hey , is bonnie here ?
she &apos;s busy .
it &apos;s important .
what &apos;s going on ?
i &apos;ve called you , like , a hundred times .
kol is in our house .
i have to go .
i said no .
stop telling me what to do !
no one &apos;s going anywhere !
mom ?
abby , please come in .
what are you doing here ?
your father called . who &apos;s professor shane ?
what has he been teaching you ?
bonnie , we don &apos;t have time for this .
this is a family matter .
my sister &apos;s in trouble . we need bonnie &apos;s help .
my daughter is done helping elena gilbert .
now get out .
mom !
answer my question .
what lies has this professor been telling you ?
don &apos;t ! jeremy ! hey , stop !
stop .
don &apos;t hurt her . she &apos;s my mom .
look at me .
just go , okay ?
i &apos;m right behind you .
you wanna talk ?
let &apos;s talk .
but i think this is a good year .
what if i said i don &apos;t believe you ?
ok , you got me . i don &apos;t know anything about wine .
just seems odd that you being so willing
to give up something you want so much .
i would do anything for my brother .
and if what you &apos;re saying about silas is true .
what does it matter what i want
if it puts everyone else in danger ?
well , this has been a lightning .
thanks for the drinks .
i &apos;ll take your request for truth under advisement .
is there any chance that you can be wrong about silas ?
trust me , elena .
some things are better left buried .
think i saw a horro movie that started just like this .
did you know they play movies on tv all night long now ?
hundreds of them .
so much better than those silly
black @-@ and @-@ white picture shows we use to go to .
i don &apos;t know .
kind of miss the old ones .
you got any requests for the dj ?
i &apos;ll let you pick . nothing cheesy .
oh , that leaves out about half the decade .
hope you like the cure .
funny .
so is everything about the eighties so ...
excessive ?
it had its charm .
&quot; say anything &quot; --
lloyd dobler standing outside of a bedroom window
with a boombox over his head
desperately trying to get back the girl of his dreams .
&quot; princess bride &quot; --
wesley slays giant rats for love .
&quot; breakfast club &quot; -- one detention
turns a bunch of outcasts into allies .
so it was a decade of sentimental drivel , as well .
well , i was gonna say love , friendship ,
possibility of anything happening .
you would &apos;ve loved it .
and why is that ?
because , as much as we both hate to admit it ,
we care about those things .
that better not be a corsage .
i loathe corsages .
these were all the rage in the eighties .
let &apos;s dance .
i &apos;m sorry . he left .
i mean , i tried to stall as long as i could .
that &apos;s bonnie . she was right behind me .
i &apos;ve considered your request for truce .
request denied .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;ve already been invited in .
hide and seek ?
fine by me .
dad needs to mind his own business ,
he had no right to call you here .
it &apos;s not just your father , bonnie .
witches talk . word gets around .
i found a new way to practice .
it &apos;s unconventional , but i can handle myself , i promise .
that &apos;s not what shane said .
shane is sitting in a jail cell right now .
you &apos;re gonna take his word over mine ?
i &apos;ve warned you about dark magic before .
it &apos;s not dark magic . it &apos;s expression , and i need it .
they found a cure , mom .
there &apos;s a cure for vampirism ,
and i can do the spell to access it .
i can save you , but i have to go ...
now .
i &apos;m not the one that needs to be saved .
you are .
your brother &apos;s lack of communication is infuriating .
it &apos;s one of his trademarks ,
like his brooding and his hair .
i don &apos;t understand what &apos;s taking so long .
i mean , how hard is it to steal a dagger ?
from the vampire who &apos;s been stabbed by it as many times as your sister ,
i &apos;d say difficult .
sweet .
you disappoint me , damon .
you &apos;re not trying very hard to get out of here .
i expected more the daring escape artist ,
less the cell potato .
well , i am compelled to kill jeremy ,
so i figured it &apos;s probably smarter
to sit in there and chitchat with you
than try to bust out of here like the hulk .
how do you think elena felt about that , by the way ,
your inability to overcome kol &apos;s compulsion for a single moment ,
even though it meant killing the person
she loves the most in the world ?
she &apos;s met me .
she knows impulse control is not my strong suit .
still , must be hard
trying to live up to stefan .
i remember when i compelled him to feed on elena ,
he fought so hard , he actually managed to resist .
now , that &apos;s love .
what do you know about love ?
i know that you &apos;re in love with elena ,
but i think you &apos;re afraid of what might happen
when we find the cure at the end of the rainbow .
personally , i don &apos;t see a fairy @-@ tale ending for you ?
all i see is stefan and elena .
i think you see the same thing .
well , if it isn &apos;t the happy homicidal maniac .
do you know that your darling former blood bag
and her brother are trying to kill me ?
what ?
don &apos;t pretend like you &apos;re not in on it .
your obsession to find the cure
clearly trumps any sibling loyalty you once felt .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
i &apos;m going to rip off jeremy &apos;s arm
and kill elena just for sport .
then i &apos;m coming for you .
what the hell is going on ?
i don &apos;t know .
what are stefan and elena planning ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;ve been stuck in the penalty box with you since yesterday .
stefan won &apos;t talk to me ,
and elena won &apos;t come to see me .
so maybe you &apos;re right . maybe she &apos;s written me off .
tell me what you know .
i don &apos;t know anything about a plan .
you stay here till i return .
i will stay here until you return ...
or not .
it &apos;s amazing which you can find stashed away in the teachers &apos; lounge .
this song is not as terrible as the other ones .
this song is the godfather of rock anthems , ok ?
what &apos;s going on with you ?
you &apos;re ... fun tonight .
i can &apos;t listen to this music
without thinking of my best friend lexi .
we spent most of the eighties together .
i remember this one time she snuck us backstage
and compelled half the band to do tequila shots
with us before the show .
she was fearless , kind of like you .
so you slept with her , too ?
no . it wasn &apos;t like that .
i was just a better person when i was with her .
i didn &apos;t think i &apos;d ever feel that way again .
until elena .
until elena .
and now that &apos;s over .
that look right there ,
that is why i don &apos;t let myself care .
well , you can say that ,
but we both know it &apos;s not true .
don &apos;t worry .
i &apos;ll protect you if kol tracks his way
to this abandoned dance .
i think i &apos;ll choose next song .
no . you know what ? i &apos;ve a better idea .
that way .
will you coming ?
missed .
go !
now , about that arm .
like that !
this is ridiculous .
well , that &apos;s the whole point of the &quot; breakfast club &quot; slide .
it &apos;s supposed to be ridiculous .
no . that &apos;s--
that &apos;s cheating .
what is fun about hurtling down a hallway
like a teenage imbecile ?
you &apos;re just gonna have to do it to find out .
all right . it &apos;s the shoes .
take off your shoes , you &apos;ll be fine , ok ?
this is what you want right ?
go ahead .
take care .
you &apos;re right , i do care .
i want stupid koala corsages
and a prom .
i want to have kids with someone
who loves me enough to stand
outside my window with a stupid boombox .
i want to be human .
so let klaus put down my brother .
let &apos;s go find the cure .
come on , let &apos;s go .
you dragged her ?
just enough to keep her down
until i can get some witches here
to clean her mind from that poison
that professor has been teaching her .
that &apos;s not happening .
bonnie , please .
i don &apos;t belong to the spirits anymore .
i belong to myself . sorry .
now , like i said , i don &apos;t fancy the hunter &apos;s curse .
so i &apos;m just gonna chop off your arm , but don &apos;t worry .
i &apos;ll heal you right up with a bit of blood after .
sorry about the sting .
now , which arm is it ? is it left or right ?
i &apos;ll just chop off both to be safe .
jeremy ! now !
what did you do ?
we didn &apos;t have a choice .
he was trying to cut off jeremy &apos;s arm .
lies .
he never would &apos;ve gotten
inside if you hadn &apos;t have set a trap for him .
you said you were gonna put him down , too .
i was gonna make him suffer on my terms !
i want to burn this house to the ground ,
and then when you try to flee for our lives ,
i &apos;ll kill you both without blinking .
you kill us , you &apos;ll never get to the cure .
you &apos;ll never be able to make any more hybrids .
you really think i care for an instant about my bloody hybrids ?
i want the cure so i can destroy it .
i would &apos;ve killed you all the second we dug it up ,
but now i &apos;m just gonna watch you burn instead .
invite him in .
do it .
come in .
living room . go .
witch , you can &apos;t do this to me .
you have no idea what i can do now .
i will hunt all of you to your end !
do you hear me ? do you ?
i don &apos;t believe you .
kol is not dead . he can &apos;t be .
listen , rebekah . they didn &apos;t have a choice .
kol started this when he went after jeremy .
he went after you , too . do you remember ?
i mean , he was never gonna let us find the cure .
so you knew .
this whole night , you knew .
i &apos;m not gonna let the people that i care about get hurt .
not jeremy , not elena , not even damon .
and you can hate me for it .
now he can &apos;t hurt you , either .
and i want us to find this cure together ,
you and me .
not just for elena , but for you .
so you can have what you want .
you can be who you want .
you can be human again .
everyone deserves a second chance right ?
why would i trust you ?
i don &apos;t know .
i guess i could give you my word ,
but at the end of the day you &apos;ll just have to take a leap .
didn &apos;t work .
it took time for finn &apos;s line to die off .
remember ? it &apos;ll work .
what if it doesn &apos;t ?
where &apos;s that gilbert optimism ?
sorry i missed all the excitment .
i &apos;m just happy to see you .
so i guess i didn &apos;t miss much .
got the silas &apos;s headstone .
we &apos;re just waiting for jeremy &apos;s mark to grow .
klaus is trapped in our living room .
temporarily .
i drawn the new moon to bond the spell .
got three days to find that cure , four max .
if we don &apos;t , we might as well look up katherine &apos;s appearance
and see if she wants some company in hiding ,
&apos;cuz he will come after us .
we &apos;ll find it .
now we &apos;ve got rebekah taken care of ,
all we need is professor shane ,
we &apos;ll get everything we need .
yeah , i didn &apos;t uh ... i didn &apos;t dagger her .
what ? why not ?
i didn &apos;t need to , she &apos;s on our side .
on our side ?
did you really just say that ?
yeah . she handed over the headstone ,
i mean she wants to find this cure more than anyone of us .
why would you possibly think that you could trust her ?
let me guess . she pledged her allegiance
to you while you were naked in the sack .
i bet you &apos;re just dying to get that out , aren &apos;t you damon ?
oh was this supposed to be secret ?
maybe you should make that a little clearer
while you &apos;re bleeding me dry in our cellar .
that is keeping you from killing jeremy .
stop it , both of you .
now why don &apos;t you tell her to calm down , damon ?
you &apos;ve managed she is all sire bond pretty well so far , haven &apos;t you ?
it &apos;s happening .
my god .
what ? you can see it ?
