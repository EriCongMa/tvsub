glory be to the father ...
to the son ...
where is it ?
to the holy spirit .
as it was in the beginning , is now , and ever shall be ,
so help me god .
where is it ? !
holy spirit ...
oh , for the love of christ .
damn !
yum .
tastes just like a ham @-@ and @-@ cheese omelet .
except without the ham and the cheese and the omelet .
how did -- what ?
no .
i am not playing &quot; what not to wear &quot;
at 8 : 30 in the morning .
wh-- it &apos;s just pants and a shirt !
well , it &apos;s just ... you &apos;re meeting jack today ,
and i want you to look as good for him as you do for me .
which is really good , by the way .
so you want me to wear my alexander wang dress ?
you have an alexander wang dress ?
no .
besides , i &apos;d worry less about what i &apos;m wearing
and worry about yourself .
well , what are you talking about ?
your earrings .
they &apos;re chanel .
one of them is .
what ?
oh , god , what else am i missing ?
hopefully it &apos;s not something that rhymes with the word &quot; manties . &quot;
what ?
where &apos;s your usual confident demeanor ?
oh , i don &apos;t know . i just ...
you know , i just -- i think that jack is great .
and i just really want to make a good first impression .
which is silly , because he &apos;s already met me ,
so this is like a third or fourth impression ,
and the science is unequivocal on whether ...
okay .
in this early and awkward stage ,
let &apos;s not concentrate on what we &apos;re wearing .
let &apos;s concentrate on remaining calm
and not scaring him off .
right .
so , no talking about work .
why ? the body is endlessly fascinating .
yes , it is .
but less so the insides . fine .
then what do i talk about when something work @-@ related comes up ?
anything .
oh , you say anything , but ...
okay , okay . talk about puppies .
puppies ?
yeah , everybody loves puppies .
true .
inflammation on the intestinal track of puppies --
the outsides , maura .
everybody loves the outsides of puppies .
keys .
oh , see what happens when you get rid
of the dewey decimal system ?
i &apos;m fairly certain this isn &apos;t the work
of some killer librarian .
victim is brendan mchale -- dealt in rare books .
ooh , how rare ?
some of the ones used as throw pillows ,
they &apos;re worth several thousand dollars .
ooh . somebody went big papi on this safe over here .
killer was looking for something .
well , i doubt whatever &apos;s in there &apos;s worth dying over ,
but i guess we &apos;ll find out .
bpd &apos;s still got a safe guy , right ?
tobin . he &apos;ll be here tomorrow .
that &apos;s not exactly the urgency i was hoping for .
oh , he &apos;s at a conference in las vegas .
why does everybody get to go conferences except us ?
what would we talk about at a conference ?
baseball and how screwed up senior management is .
you want to travel across the country for that ?
if there was an open bar .
jane , korsak .
the bruising indicates that each finger was broken separately ,
in about five @-@ minute intervals .
frozen peas . doubt he was making a side dish .
the moisture on the epidermis of the fully @-@ broken right hand
is significantly higher than the left .
so the killer was using the frozen peas as an ice pack
to keep him awake while they tortured him .
good times .
the vic &apos;s only employee is wondering if he can leave .
you want to talk to him ?
this is ricky kelly . he works here at the book store .
he called us when he found brendan this morning .
who did that to him ?
we don &apos;t know yet .
you have any ideas ?
no .
how long have you worked here ?
little over three years .
do you know if mr. mchale
was having any problems with anybody ?
no . brendan made it a point to get along with everyone .
how did you end up working here ?
no offense , ricky .
but you hardly seem like the rare @-@ books type .
don &apos;t judge a book by its cover .
i think that &apos;s the saying , right , detective ?
yes , but i &apos;d still like an answer .
i needed a job , he gave me one .
simple as that .
in our experience , things are rarely that simple .
you know what he kept in the safe ?
nope .
you know the combination or where he keeps it ?
nope .
do you have an alibi for last night ?
nope .
look into this kid &apos;s background .
he didn &apos;t seem too shaken up over his boss &apos;s death .
which means he &apos;s either guilty ,
or he &apos;s a 20 @-@ year @-@ old street kid ,
keeps his emotions to himself .
i think we should probably figure out which it is .
can you write your contact information down
just in case we have any more questions later ?
please ?
he died of shock due to an inadequate substrate
for aerobic cellular respiration .
he stopped breathing .
and his blood pressure also plummeted .
his heartbeat skyrocketed , his organs compensated ,
shut down , and then he stopped breathing .
so , the torture caused him to die from shock .
yes .
and it appears that the killer thought
that brendan had passed out .
he tried to revive him with a slap ,
and then with amyl nitrate .
but brendan was already dead so there isn &apos;t any in his lungs ,
but we did find traces of it
on the outer crest of his left nostril .
hmm , well , we didn &apos;t find any poppers at the scene ,
but i can have a team search the surrounding areas .
fyi , dead bodies not being able to inhale amyl nitrate --
perfect example of what not to talk to jack about .
jane , i hope you don &apos;t have dinner plans .
oh , actually , we do . we &apos;re about to meet --
but ... you were saying ... ?
the officer guarding the book store was attacked .
our crime scene &apos;s been broken into .
what ?
yeah .
great . i &apos;m sorry .
jack will understand .
can you reschedule for tomorrow ?
i will .
okay , and remember ...
i know . catuli .
ye-- no , puppies .
yes , that &apos;s &quot; puppies &quot; in latin .
maura , i just don &apos;t want you --
i know -- screw up a relationship
with the first guy i like who doesn &apos;t want to kill me .
yes .
i was doing a routine perimeter patrol .
next thing i know , i wake up staring at the ceiling .
and when you came to , that &apos;s when you made the call ?
yeah , immediately .
the guy , uh , must have heard me on the phone and took off .
i tried to give chase , but ...
woozy . yeah , i get it .
did you catch a glimpse of his face ?
no .
but i could tell he was a big guy -- tall .
for you to say tall , he must be a giraffe .
take care of yourself , all right ?
what is so valuable that someone is going to break
into a guarded crime scene to get to ?
tobin the safecracker &apos;s still in vegas .
i had the captain tell him to catch a flight back tonight .
we have an inventory of everything in the book shop .
nothing of value &apos;s missing .
well , whatever all this is about , it must still be in here .
i &apos;ll be sure to get two units to guard the place tonight .
was jack okay with us having to reschedule dinner ?
oh , definitely . he &apos;s very understanding .
he even made us a reservation
at a wonderful french restaurant .
do they have toast ?
french toast .
yeah , set you up for that one .
it was right in my strike zone ,
and i knocked it through the uprights .
and i &apos;ve never been more proud to call you my friend .
you should have seen me last night .
not even one slipup about a cold cadaver ?
nope .
but did you know you can cross a poodle
with almost any dog to make it hypoallergenic ?
they &apos;re called doodles .
there are 50 different kinds .
there &apos;s labradoodles and goldendoodles ,
and , my favorite , the schnoodle .
it &apos;s a schnauzer / poodle .
what happens if you cross one with a poodle ?
do you get a poo @-@ poo doodle ?
no , it &apos;s just a poodle .
we found a popper vial in the trash can near the book store .
i sent it over to the crime lab .
great . any word on our wayward safecracker ?
he &apos;s meeting you at the book store in two hours .
guess it takes that long to wash the vegas off you .
based on how he sounded on the phone ,
i think you &apos;ll be lucky if he puts in any effort at all .
so , i finished the background check on ricky ,
that kid from the book store .
beat cop in mission hills said he was a troubled kid --
ran with the bad crowd .
he was a regular at the precinct up there .
he been in trouble recently ?
oh , i &apos;m glad you asked .
two weeks ago , ricky kelly
tried to sell this illustrated page for 400 bucks .
how did he get caught ?
well , the buyer saw the straight edge
and was afraid it had been cut out of a rare book .
if ricky was arrested , why didn &apos;t this pop up sooner ?
he didn &apos;t get arrested .
when brendan was contacted , he said the page was his ,
but he refused to press charges .
so brendan gave him a second chance ?
well , it &apos;s possible ricky
was just doing the nickel @-@ and @-@ dime thefts
while he was waiting to get whatever was inside the safe .
when he got caught , he knew his time was up .
solid theory .
pretty sucky outcome , if that &apos;s what happened .
you &apos;re telling me .
everybody needs money .
you think i &apos;m gonna beat the hell out of him
for a couple hundred bucks ?
we spoke to a cop in your neighborhood ,
he said you were suspected of a lot of things .
i &apos;ll bet you didn &apos;t have good reasons for doing those , either .
i &apos;m not proud of what i &apos;ve done , but --
but t @-@ they don &apos;t add up to murder .
i would never hurt brendan .
all right , then explain this .
i sold those , and others too ,
just to pay bills in the store .
did brendan ask you to ?
he didn &apos;t know . not until i got caught .
and then what did he say ?
he gave me a dozen more
to frame and sell those , too , if i wanted .
well , he &apos;s not dead because he &apos;s a bad businessman .
i don &apos;t know why he &apos;s dead . okay ?
brendan changed .
about six months ago , he stopped caring about the store .
he stopped answering calls . he stopped returning e @-@ mails .
we hadn &apos;t sold books in months .
i had to frame and sell these prints
just to keep the lights on .
you have evidence that you were doing that ?
yeah , i got all the invoices at my apartment --
what i got , what i spent the money on .
i wouldn &apos;t hurt brendan , ever .
he came into the boys &amp; girls club
about three years ago and asked for an intern .
he gave me a job , and that is what turned my life around .
when we first talked ,
you said , &quot; i needed a job , he gave me a job .
simple as that . &quot; now you change your story ?
yeah , well , the first time we met ,
you said i didn &apos;t look like the rare @-@ book type ,
so i guess we &apos;ll just call it even .
okay .
what happened to brendan six months ago ?
i don &apos;t know .
he stopped talking ,
and he started going to church every day .
i thought it was because of me , and then it turns out
it had nothing to do with me .
it was just in his own head .
but you don &apos;t know why ?
i wish i did .
maybe i could have done something to help him .
i heard you got something off the amyl nitrate bottle ?
uh , no , it was clean .
oh . so why did you call me ?
i had a crime tech go back and get the trash @-@ can lid
where the bottle was found , and ...
five solid prints .
you &apos;re very good at your job .
well , i have a very good light , but thank you .
do they match anyone in the afis ?
i didn &apos;t run it through the system yet .
i wouldn &apos;t want to overstep my bounds as the medical examiner .
but i &apos;ve got them all set up
for you to do the search through the database .
you weren &apos;t really gonna run it through the system ?
oh , of course i was .
i just hadn &apos;t pressed &quot; enter &quot; yet .
so , i heard you &apos;re dating someone ?
i am .
it &apos;s ... been a couple of times , but ...
i mean , jane hasn &apos;t even met him yet .
well , i &apos;m sure she &apos;ll like him . she likes everyone .
i mean , she likes everyone we like .
she &apos;s an excellent judge of character .
speaking of jane , where is she ?
she &apos;s at the crime scene
with korsak and the safecracker .
donald maxwell .
not the type of guy you want to bring home to mother .
not even his mother .
is that a hickey ?
what happens in vegas .
what happens in vegas delayed our investigation .
yeah , i was at a conference .
is that what they call the strippers &apos; convention now ?
they have conventions , too ?
looks like i didn &apos;t delay your investigation at all , geraldo .
someone was trying hard to break into an empty safe .
you know , whatever we &apos;ve been looking for ,
i &apos;m not sure that it &apos;s been in here , at least not recently .
maybe mchale knew the killer was coming ,
hid it someplace else ?
yeah , hid it someplace else .
or maybe ...
the safe was just meant to be heavy .
korsak , does that look odd to you ?
yeah , like somebody &apos;s been messing with the baseboard .
hey , lover boy , can i borrow your crowbar ?
it &apos;s tobin .
you want me to do that for you ?
you want me to hit you in the nuts with it ?
great hiding place .
not that it did him any damn good .
father cowens ?
and when we pried the baseboard off ,
we found a book with this note in it .
i &apos;ll save you the trouble of reading it .
it says &quot; thanks . &quot;
so what was brendan asking you to do , father ?
if anything ever happened to him ,
i was to take what i &apos;d found to a professor mctavish .
mctavish ? he at bcu ?
no , state .
why mctavish ?
i don &apos;t know .
i was to tell the professor that the book was a riddle .
a riddle ?
yes .
let me get this straight , father cowens --
you were willing to steal evidence
to help a buddy solve a riddle ?
brendan was an esteemed member of my church .
it was clear that something was weighing heavy on his heart ,
and he needed my help to free himself .
i see that as my job , detective .
isn &apos;t that what confession &apos;s for ?
well , i &apos;m a fan of the ritual .
but it doesn &apos;t always give people what they need .
so he didn &apos;t confess anything
that seems relevant to my investigation ?
well , if he had , i wouldn &apos;t discuss that with you .
but no , he did not .
so how did you know he had troubles ?
for years , brendan &apos;s been a holiday catholic .
he &apos;d show up for easter , christmas .
about six months ago , he started coming to sunday mass ,
and then morning mass .
and for the last few months , he &apos;s been the lay leader
dringing up the holy sacrament for daily mass .
didn &apos;t take a rocket scientist to see
that brendan was trying to fill some sort of hole in his life .
and when were you gonna go get the book ?
as soon as you cleared out .
and my investigation would have been stalled permanently .
at least you &apos;re honest , i &apos;ll give you that .
i don &apos;t get it . it &apos;s a book .
it &apos;s old .
and , yes , old things are valuable ,
but was brendan mchale so down on his luck
that he &apos;s gonna let someone kill him
as opposed to turning it over ?
well , bill gates paid $ 30 million
for a codex of da vinci &apos;s .
and yet , no one is breaking his fingers to try and get it .
so my question stands .
and who is this mctavish guy
the priest was supposed to take the book to ?
do you know him ?
uh , he &apos;s a professor of literature at state .
i met him at a fundraiser for the library .
you know , he &apos;s a superhero
in the world of illuminated manuscripts .
okay , first of all , that &apos;s not a world .
and even if it were , they would not have superheroes .
you know , he found the gamea prayer book
in a library in croatia .
it hadn &apos;t been seen in three centuries .
mctavish spent 15 years tracking it down .
so he &apos;s a nerd .
big time .
but you know what &apos;s strange is he &apos;s an expert
in illuminated manuscripts from the middle ages ,
and this book looks to be from the 19th century .
nothing is ever easy .
okay , so , how do we proceed ?
well , same as usual . no page will be left unturned .
straight through the uprights . very nice . very nice .
how do i look ?
uh ... well , that &apos;s a very challenging palette
for you , angela , but you seem to be pulling it off .
damn .
what can i do to look worse ?
ma , you look like a russian nesting doll . what is up ?
i &apos;m breaking up with sean today
and i didn &apos;t want to look too good .
to get him all hot and bothered
and then dump him would be cruel .
i @-@ i thought that you liked lieutenant cavanaugh ?
i do , very much .
but ... ?
but i &apos;m re @-@ thinking my life , and i need to let go of sean .
and i don &apos;t want to hurt him .
okay , well , ma , i can say with the utmost certainty ,
you have never looked worse .
thank you , sweetheart .
you &apos;re welcome .
this doesn &apos;t happen often .
but right now , i &apos;m very confused .
oh , yeah , you &apos;ll figure out that book
before you figure out my mother .
you didn &apos;t look hard enough , donald .
we found it behind the safe in mchale &apos;s office .
listen -- i &apos;ve got you dead to rights .
we have your fingerprints on a trash can
near the scene of his murder .
so , i &apos;m gonna give you a chance to make a deal for yourself .
just tell me what makes this book worth killing a man over ?
the sound of your voice is really starting to grate on me .
look , i don &apos;t mind your silence .
whatever you go to say , write it down .
well , i &apos;ve really enjoyed our little chat .
oh , my god .
don &apos;t freak out .
why , because you &apos;ve completely disemboweled
the key piece of evidence in my murder case ?
i can put it back together in 10 minutes ,
which is probably 5 minutes more than it took brendan to make it .
he made it ?
it &apos;s a frankenstein .
the -- the pages , the front and back board ,
the spine are all from the 19th century ,
but the glue and the thread are less than a year old .
so , it &apos;s a counterfeit rare book ?
well , not in a meaningful sense .
a third @-@ grader who liked rare books
would know it was a fake .
you and i were very different third @-@ graders .
how much is it worth ?
approximately ?
ballpark .
absolutely nothing .
i know . this is a setback .
should i cancel with jack ?
what ? no , we can &apos;t cancel on him again .
so we go , then ?
or is there a third jane @-@ ian option i haven &apos;t thought of ?
i just can &apos;t figure out why someone is willing to die
to hide a completely worthless and fake book .
i just ...
i &apos;ll cancel .
hey , ricky .
hi .
you needed to see me ?
yeah .
is this an okay time ?
yeah , sure . you want me to buy you a cup of coffee ?
actually ,
i got my little sister in the car waiting .
i &apos;m taking her to a soccer game .
fun . how old is she ?
she &apos;s 14 . yeah .
and , thankfully , nothing like me when i was that age , so ...
get straight as , respects her teachers .
nice , nice .
yeah ...
anyways , i was seeing if i could
go back to the book store .
you know , i know brendan wouldn &apos;t want it a mess ,
and i just want to grab a broom and straighten it up .
okay , let me check with the crime techs , okay ?
see when they &apos;re finished .
yeah , yeah . thank you .
sure .
i don &apos;t really ...
i don &apos;t really know what to do with myself right now , you know ?
used to have a job , and brendan expected things of me .
right .
well , you know , just &apos; cause he &apos;s gone ,
it doesn &apos;t mean you can &apos;t expect those things of yourself .
yeah .
yeah , of course . of course i can .
do you know why this happened ?
do you know why someone would have killed him ?
not yet , no .
yeah , okay .
but i @-@ i &apos;ll call you as soon as i know , okay ?
yeah , thank you .
and thank you for checking on that book @-@ store thing for me .
sure . anytime .
so , have fun .
tell your sister i said good luck .
she -- she doesn &apos;t need it . she &apos;s fierce .
okay , all right .
was there ever a moment , professor --
year 11 , year 12 -- where you thought ,
&quot; the prayer book doesn &apos;t exist , it &apos;s just a rumor &quot; ?
you looked for something for 12 years ?
15 .
was it valuable ?
very , from an intellectual perspective .
what &apos;s that mean ?
well , in classic economic terms , the value of something
is determined when two parties come
to mutually agreeable terms .
but that &apos;s not possible when the object
is of incalculable cultural importance .
i &apos;m not gonna lie to you , dr. isles ,
there were moments i had doubts i &apos;d never find it , but ...
i &apos;m just one of those guys --
i can &apos;t put down the crossword till i &apos;ve finished it .
perseverance -- secret of all triumphs .
victor hugo .
well , from what i can tell , your assessment &apos;s spot @-@ on .
any reputable dealer -- excuse me --
would recognize the book as a fake .
have you x @-@ rayed for microdots ?
yes .
what about a fluorescent examination ,
see if there was under painting behind the illustration ?
of course . again , nothing .
so , you &apos;re thinking it &apos;s not the book itself ,
but something hidden inside the book ?
exactly .
i &apos;ll take it back to the university .
won &apos;t take me long to get to the bottom of this mystery .
no can do , buckaroo .
chain of evidence , we can &apos;t let it out of our possession .
but someone wanted me to see it .
and now you have .
besides , however long it was gonna take you to figure it out ,
i &apos;m guessing she &apos;d do it in half the time .
well , very nice meeting you , dr. isles .
buckaroo ?
you have 7.1 / 2 years and not a minute more .
are you feeling okay , angela ?
you don &apos;t look so well .
thanks for coming to meet me .
of course .
you know , i think you &apos;re a terrific person .
you &apos;re warm and funny , kind and chivalrous .
and that &apos;s a rare quality today .
and we have a wonderful time together ,
and we share a lot of interests .
and i think we mix it up pretty good in the romance department , no ?
yes . yes , we do .
but ... ?
but ...
unfortunately , i -- i just can &apos;t be with you anymore .
why ?
okay , i know this is gonna sound wacky ,
but i got a fortune cookie last week ,
and it read &quot; start over . &quot;
and i @-@ i kind of knew what that meant .
a fortune cookie ?
yeah ... look , it &apos;s not about the fortune cookie .
it &apos;s about being ready for the sign .
and you &apos;re ready ?
well , i need to take a chance .
be alone , without a man , for once in my life .
so i get to know who i am .
i understand .
you do ?
yeah .
all &apos;s i ever wanted was for you to be happy , angela .
and if something in the cosmos told you
that starting over is the first step , then you take that step .
wow , you &apos;re even more terrific than i thought you were , sean cavanaugh .
but i do have one last question .
okay .
where did you get that dress ?
do you like it ?
no , not at all .
but that &apos;s okay , &apos; cause i remember
what you look like without it .
guy doesn &apos;t move .
i saw him blink 20 minutes ago .
he &apos;s a well @-@ trained monkey .
makes me sick .
me too , but there &apos;s nothing we can do about it
if he wants to lawyer up and ask for bail ...
n @-@ no ... no , i @-@ i meant the bread .
just ... everything makes me queasy .
detectives ? the suspect &apos;s lawyer &apos;s here .
our cue to leave .
korsak .
well , well , well , look what the cat drug in .
saw your lawyer today .
your lawyer represents this guy .
don &apos;t know him .
donald maxwell .
he &apos;s involved in the murder
of a book seller named brendan mchale .
they &apos;re killing book sellers now ?
what &apos;s next , the ice @-@ cream man ?
they broke his fingers one by one
until he died of shock .
just seems like something they would do back in the old days .
you think i &apos;m involved ?
i didn &apos;t come here &apos; cause i missed you .
right .
well , in case you haven &apos;t noticed , i &apos;m in prison .
in case you haven &apos;t noticed ,
you &apos;re still the biggest crime boss in boston .
i had nothing to do with this .
okay , but maybe you still know some things .
the killer was looking for something .
who sends this guy to find it ?
how &apos;s maura ?
she &apos;s good . really good .
nobody sends donald maxwell to do something difficult .
he couldn &apos;t break wind without help .
then why is he at my crime scene ?
i don &apos;t know .
but he &apos;s just an errand boy .
an errand boy .
so , what -- maybe he &apos;s helping out somebody around boston ,
somebody who &apos;s not from here ?
sounds like donald &apos;s speed .
well , if he &apos;s driving somebody around ,
maybe he &apos;s got to get back to them .
thank you .
jane .
yeah ?
now can you do me a favor ?
they &apos;re releasing maxwell in 10 or 15 minutes .
yeah , yeah , we &apos;ll be right behind him .
all right , bye , jane . drive safe .
jane &apos;s gone ? w @-@ when will she be back ?
she &apos;s going up to wellington .
penitentiary ?
yeah .
for the case .
yeah .
you okay ?
yeah .
uh , i got to go .
surveillance .
he &apos;s stopping in front of 2264 .
make sure that &apos;s where he &apos;s headed before we grab him .
you let me go on bail .
yes , we did . aren &apos;t we nice ?
keep him quiet someplace else .
so , what do we do if he wasn &apos;t meeting up with our killer ?
he &apos;s married and he lives on the south side ?
he would have rushed home instead of rushing here .
guess he &apos;s got a girlfriend .
so , it &apos;s heartfelt &quot; i &apos;m sorry &quot; and a call to his wife ?
seems only right .
let &apos;s go .
police ! don &apos;t hurt me !
sometimes it pays to be the slowest guy in the room .
you &apos;re here late .
just trying to figure out what this book is about .
right .
anyway ...
i know you saw paddy .
yeah , frankie said he ran into you .
i was gonna tell you when i got back .
look , you &apos;re just doing your job .
you don &apos;t owe me an explanation .
paddy is being transferred to a supermax prison in atwater .
atwater &apos;s in california .
and why -- why are they moving him ?
it &apos;s just a thing they do with high @-@ security felons .
it keeps them from getting comfortable .
he said that he would like to see you before he leaves .
do we have anything left to say to each other ?
i mean , i don &apos;t know if you have anything to say to him ,
but i think he feels like he would like
to get some more things off his chest ,
you know , before it &apos;s too late .
but you don &apos;t have to go and listen .
off his chest .
yeah .
i mean , i think he just feels , you know --
sh-- maura ?
取证实验室
are you okay ?
brendan felt guilty .
yeah , he -- he hired the needy intern
and was going to church .
clearly , he was working through something .
and he was willing to die to protect this book
because he wanted mctavish to have it .
but it wasn &apos;t mctavish &apos;s expertise
that made him so important .
it was his persistence .
the riddle .
no , you looked . you didn &apos;t find anything .
because it &apos;s not in the book .
it is the book .
brendan wasn &apos;t trying to make a fake 19th @-@ century book ,
he made a book that pointed to the 19th century .
and mctavish would have realized it
not as fast as i did , but still
that brendan had hidden something with a technique
that was primarily used during that time
called fore @-@ edge painting .
he was involved in a bombing that killed two people .
this is his confession .
what are you doing ?
watching her work .
your sister ?
no , the cop she &apos;s with .
she &apos;s british . her name &apos;s gillian .
she &apos;s got one of those accents , you know ,
like james bond and mary poppins rolled into one .
oh , even insults sound good in that accent .
yeah , i wish she &apos;d insult me .
i &apos;m such an idiot .
i took her to the break room
and i offered her coffee instead of tea .
oh , the queen would be mortified .
right ? i got so flustered .
what , is she scotland yard or mi6 ?
i don &apos;t know .
probably not mi6,
or she &apos;d have disappeared you over the coffee thing .
basically , she started talking and i went into dreamland .
tell me something , korsak ,
why do the brits sound so much smarter
and more sophisticated than we do ?
don &apos;t know . i &apos;m like that with hungarians .
i hear those guttural sounds , i &apos;m putty .
this is incredible .
how did you figure it out ?
are you some sort of bibliophile ?
no , it -- it -- it wasn &apos;t me .
it was our resident everything @-@ o @-@ phile ,
dr. maura isles .
i don &apos;t know everything .
what &apos;s the capital of chile ?
she knows .
the victims were soldiers .
in all these years , we &apos;ve never had a single lead
as to who was responsible for the bombing .
mr. mchale &apos;s confession ties up all the loose ends .
one thing i don &apos;t understand --
why did he hide his confession in a book ?
why didn &apos;t he just turn himself in ?
i think he was going to .
we still have active wire taps on some of the former members
of irish @-@ liberation organizations .
we &apos;ve been picking up anxious chatter
about someone confessing to the bombing .
his co @-@ conspirators might have been getting nervous .
so , the book was like an insurance policy .
if something happened to him ,
at least the truth would come out .
and he was right .
now , with this , the forensic evidence you uncovered ,
the people you arrested , and our wire taps ,
we &apos;ll be able to close this case .
thank you both for what you &apos;ve done .
victims &apos; families have waited a long time for answers .
if you ever have something to tell me , just tell me , okay ?
don &apos;t use , like , codes
or invisible ink or talking animals .
a talking animal seems like the worst way to hide a secret .
have you never seen a pirate movie ?
where are you going ?
uh , to see ricky .
he &apos;s waiting for me in the break room .
what are you gonna tell him ?
the truth .
you mean that sometimes people we love do horrible things ,
but it doesn &apos;t have anything to do
with how they feel about us ?
something like that , yeah .
or i could just talk about doogles .
doodles .
either way , i think i could use cross @-@ bred puppies
as a metaphor for change .
i &apos;m not sure if that makes any sense ,
either from a genealogy perspective or an emotional one .
or it could be brilliant and you just haven &apos;t realized it .
and it &apos;s santiago .
brilliant !
okay , ma , you sure you &apos;re not hurting yourself ?
no , no . the body is meant to be flexible , baby .
okay , i -- i don &apos;t think it &apos;s meant to be that flexible .
i think you &apos;re right .
all right , so , how did it go with lieutenant cavanaugh ?
he understood .
what did he say about the dress ?
yeah , uh , he saw right through it .
he &apos;ll be okay .
what about you ? are you okay ?
yeah . i &apos;m good .
really ?
yeah .
i &apos;m not in a relationship , i quit my job ,
and i &apos;ll have a complete fresh start .
ma , you quit your job ?
everything &apos;s got to change , baby .
for me , it &apos;s like i &apos;ve got to tear down the house ,
right down to the foundation , so i can start again .
you got another job lined up ?
nope .
this way i &apos;ll have absolute freedom from everything .
right , but the absolute freedom part
sounds like absolute absence of a plan .
well , that &apos;s how you figure out what you want to do next .
you &apos;re gonna have a lot of free time on your hands .
yeah , i &apos;m excited .
and this way , i &apos;ll be able to help you .
w @-@ what -- you &apos;re gonna still stay here at maura &apos;s ?
who knows ?
wait , you know my couch doesn &apos;t fold out , right ?
your earrings match .
you &apos;re eating cream cheese .
uh , yes , i &apos;m throwing caution to the wind .
nauseous without cream cheese , nauseous with .
so i figured i &apos;d pick the best option that has the most flavor .
well , your mother &apos;s not the only one making changes .
well , my first ...
order of business is that i &apos;m ready to meet jack .
about that ...
i &apos;ve cleared my schedule .
my toast will soon be eaten .
i have even researched the doodle .
i &apos;m seriously considering adopting a st. bernadoodle .
they &apos;re very cute .
well , i -- i had to cancel with jack again .
aw , why ?
there &apos;s something that i need to do .
something more important than jack ?
yeah . and i could really use some company .
yeah , okay .
i &apos;ll be right here if you need me .
