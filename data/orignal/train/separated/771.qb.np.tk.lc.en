and you should have seen the way that he lit up .
i mean , he was like a glow stick .
this is terrible .
whatever you were gonna do , please do not .

i want to create
an environment within this loft where winston feels free ,
where the gates are open . let &apos;s let winston
turn on his @-@ his black switch

ooh , yeah , pass her over .
ooh , that &apos;s ... yeah .

that is , uh , the green fairy right there .
it &apos;s absinthe .
yeah , it &apos;s absinthe .
absinthe ?
absinthe ...
nice .
has killed so many of our most famous painters .
last time i tried absinthe ,
i tried to put my car in my pocket .
come on .
let &apos;s get crazy .
come on , babe .
okay , yeah , yeah .
perfect weekend !
no , no !

ooh , you ain &apos;t lying , child .
thanks for dinner , schmidt .
you know , i really appreciate it , man .
i do feel supported .
so what &apos;s next ?
there is this one thing that i miss .
i probably shouldn &apos;t say , man .
i can &apos;t .
no , come on .
it &apos;s us , man .
schmidt , i could really go for some crack .
what ?
crack cocaine ?
i remember when i was a kid ,
me , my mom , and her mom , and well , her mom ,
and then her mom , and then of course her mom ,
and then my little cousin , peanut ,
they &apos;d all rush back to that flaming trash can
where we &apos;d sit around and harmonize
and just ... shoo @-@ op .
one of those nights i remember , well , we ran out of crack .
i &apos;d grab my scarf , and i would run on down
to the liquor store where the thugs hang out ,
and i would try to get a good deal on some crack .
whoo ! they never would give me a good price , man ,
but , uh , i tell you what ,
there &apos;s nothing like the ... the feel of a fire ,
a fresh @-@ baked cookie ,
and that sweet , sweet taste of crack in your lungs .
okay .
okay , winston , yeah .
sure , i mean , if ...
if that is something that you want to do ...
see , i knew you were gonna judge me .
i knew it .
no , winston .
i knew you were gonna judge me and just ...
winston , listen to me .
look ...
if crack cocaine is what you want
then crack cocaine is what we are going to get .
how do we do this ?
here &apos;s what we do , schmidt . we go to the projects , okay ?
we knock on some doors .
i &apos;ll wait in the car and take lookout
while you do all the legwork .
because as you say , you are in much better shape than i am .
you do have the body of a smurf .
we could ... we could just get frozen yogurt .
it &apos;s not a big deal .
schmidt isn &apos;t about no frozen yogurt .
i want to go score some crack cocaine .
really ?
we &apos;re gonna do this .
look at them .
this is a cabin , guys .
getting wasted on a couple of shots of absinthe .
word games , word games ,
word games , word games , word games .
doctor ! i was saying ...
i don &apos;t think i feel it .
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m the sober one .
that &apos;s actually never happened in my life .
who wants to play charades ?
i can hear ...
me .
one syllable , one syllable .
movie .
gattaca .
oh , i want to be them .
i have to run upstairs for a sec .
i have it on good authority my bed has disappeared .
i need to go check it out .
i got to head up there and take care of that .
oh , you @-@ you &apos;re gonna go upstairs ?
now ?
yeah .
yeah .
okay .
have fun .
i will , i guess .
up .
doesn &apos;t sound good .
oh , jess .
that sounded terrible .
the absinthe
has found a new host .
the toilet .
i like angie .
she &apos;s cool . it &apos;s kind of like
riding a poorly maintained carnival ride .
i &apos;m glad you get it .
i think she really likes you .
all right .
jeth ... i &apos;m not ... i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m with jeth .
what ?
hey , nick ,
look , we switched .
and look ... middle of the night ...
what is the big deal ?
i ... why else did we all go to a cabin together ?
to hike ?
guys , i &apos;m still really feeling it .
i just can &apos;t believe you &apos;d do that to nick .
she didn &apos;t do anything to me .
we have an open relationship .
she can do whatever she wants . i don &apos;t care .
enough . i &apos;m tired of you
acting like this cool guy
with an &quot; open relationship . &quot;
that is not you .
yes , it is , jess .
why won &apos;t you just let me be me ? this is me !
i &apos;m sorry . i just don &apos;t believe you .
you &apos;re not this guy .
no , no , no , i &apos;m not feeling good ...
at least we don &apos;t pretend to be this perfect couple .
i do not pretend to be a perfect couple .
the only reason that we &apos;re here
is &apos; cause you asked us to come ,
&apos;cause you didn &apos;t want to be alone with dr. sam .
&apos;cause then you &apos;d have to be real with him .
jess ? is that true ?
yes , but no ... it &apos;s out of context .
it &apos;s out of context , nick .
you think you know everything about me .
i &apos;m a rock and roll guy .
you are the guy who asks me to light matches for you
&apos;cause you &apos;re afraid your fingers are gonna get too hot .
i did that one time .
multiple times .
i was on the back of a motorcycle earlier ,
and i wasn &apos;t even that scared .
you don &apos;t think i &apos;m crazy ?
no .
would a sane man do this ?
whoa , whoa , whoa , hold on .
you &apos;re doing it . you &apos;re doing a lot of it .
you need to just pace it a little bit ...
oh , whoa , that ... you &apos;re really doing it .
i suppose we could just get out
and ask any of these street youths .
i &apos;ll let you get out the car first .
go ahead , do your thing , man .
i don &apos;t want to ask the wrong person
and end up with some sub @-@ par crack .
i want the fresh crack , you know ?
not some crack that &apos;s been laying around all day .
ooh ... i &apos;m really starting to schmidt .
we don &apos;t have to do this . man , we could just
turn this car around , forget this ever happened ,
and get you some frozen yogurt .
i will not let you deny who you are any longer .
not on my watch .
schmidt ...
schmidt , no .
yes . skee @-@ you !
schmidt !
you , dude .
don &apos;t call that man to this car .
hi , how are you this evening ?
what do you guys need ?
it &apos;s cool , just get in the car , man .
what cool ?
yeah , we &apos;re cool .
schmidt , you did not invite this guy in this car .
he could be crazy , could have a gun .
that &apos;s a racist thing to say ,
winston , that he ... stop it , schmidt ...
just assuming that this man has a pistol .
hi , sir .
how are you this evening ?
um , the two of us are very interested in purchasing some crack cocaine .
you guys cops ?
what ?
okay , let me out .
schmidt , schmidt ... i was just messing with you , man .
okay ? i was just trying to see
how far your stupid white guilt would take you .
have you ever done crack ?
hell , no , i &apos;ve never done crack , man .
why do you think i &apos;ve done crack ? because i &apos;m black ?
i thought you &apos;d done crack &apos; cause you told me
the whole story about you doing crack .
i thought you guys just need directions . okay ?
let me out !
okay , sir .
just calm down , all right ? oh , please , man .
be cool .
fine , okay , look , you want it ? you want it ? look !
whoa ! no ! oh my god , no !
look , my wallet . no ! no !
take my wallet ! here &apos;s my wallet , okay ?
shoot the white dude ! just let me out ...
shoot him ! no , don &apos;t shoot me !
shoot him , man ! but that &apos;s ...
that &apos;s your wallet .
that &apos;s your wallet .
are you not robbing us ?
you &apos;re not robbing me ?
i don &apos;t want to rob you , man . i thought you were gonna ...
i totally misread the situation .
i thought you was robbing me .
oh , no , man .
oh , hey , man , i &apos;m schmidt .
robert , man . robert . nice to meet you .
pleasure , man . robert , man , hey , man , nice to meet you , man .
what a nice smile he has . all right , guys . i &apos;m just ...
okay . here , i &apos;ll ... they &apos;re the child locks .
i don &apos;t even have kids , but ...
you guys have a great night , okay ?
you , too , man . be safe . take care , robert .
take it easy , man . you guys have a good night , man , all right .
that was insane .
i was terrified . that ... oh , my goodness .
i judged ...
god , robert ! robert ...
i just ... the wallet ?
oh , your wallet ... oh , your wallet .
just give him the wallet . i &apos;m really sorry .
yeah , it &apos;s kind of ... no , yeah , i get it .
i &apos;d want my wallet back , too .
thank you . all right . thanks , robert .
i wouldn &apos;t thank him . whoa , man .
what a hilarious misunderstanding .
schmidt , drive the damn car .
no , you &apos;re right .
you know , i feel so much better
after throwing up into the fire .
uh , sam , can you pass the bread ?
oh , sure thing .
no , i &apos;ll pass the bread , angie .
just keep your hands to yourself and let the bread come to you .
why do you keep taking my bread ?
oh , i &apos;m sorry . i thought you and the bread had an open relationship .
i said i was sorry . i thought this was an agreement .
i thought we were all cool with this . i don &apos;t ...
absinthe !
fun dinner . fun dinner .
i always have fun at the cabin .
you guys want to pick my brain ?
you guys want to know what i &apos;m thinking about ?
i like dogs more than cats .
i like chipmunks more than squirrels .
i believe in ufos .
i once had a bass teacher ,
when i was younger , who did the standing bass .
and he had a very weird smell , and i still think about it .
his name was mr. hilton .
i don &apos;t like the fact that you tried to kiss sam .
because i have feelings for you , angie .
i &apos;m ... i had no idea , i &apos;m sorry .
i know . we said it was open , but ...
i &apos;m proud of you for saying that .
dr. sam ?
if you were a hat , you &apos;d be a top hat .
but like a really big monopoly one .
and i say that of the deepest compliments .
appreciate it .
winston , i &apos;m sorry . i was just trying to help .
what , help me realize that i &apos;m black ?
schmidt , believe it or not , man ,
i &apos;ve known that for a while now .
i just feel bad you &apos;re forced to live here with jess and nick .
oh , wow . i mean , they &apos;re honky as hell .
and look at our people . look what we &apos;ve given to this country .
jazz ...
the management of jazz musicians ...
but , look , schmidt , being black means
whatever i want it to mean .
you know , the fact of the matter is
i live in a loft with three people
who happen to be white .
but believe you me ,
there is so much more that i find annoying about you
that i haven &apos;t even gotten to race .
now , i &apos;m gonna get some frozen yogurt .
would you like anything ?
yeah .
i &apos;ll have a vanilla chocolate swirl .
no .
what , no ...
no .
i &apos;ll have strawberry with jimmies .
did you get that ?
how you doing ?
much better .
that alcohol got on top of me .
oh ... i &apos;m a little embarrassed by that .
i &apos;m sorry about sam .
i ... i thought it was cool .
right .
and i try to ruin things as soon as they get good .
i &apos;m working on it .
believe it or not , i &apos;m working on stuff , too .
you know , i just wish i was working on less stuff .
you know , i &apos;ve been arrested three times .
four times .
four to five times .
i have tattoos of bands that i don &apos;t even like anymore .
by the way , you &apos;ve been really cool
about the &quot; jamiroquai &quot; tattoo on my butt .
i &apos;m not asking you to change .
just how about meet me in the middle a little bit ?
what do you want me to do ? go to brunch ?
are we supposed to , like , read articles
and then talk about them together ?
okay , i &apos;m never going to be that kind of girl .
i just want to do something normal .
how about not drawing pubes on my armpit
while i &apos;m sleeping ?
you think you could do something like that ?
yeah . yeah .
&apos;cause i would really like to keep this going .
i don &apos;t move your twin bed over here ?
sexy , sexy , sexy .
bird ! bird ! bird !
oh , my god .
help ! help !
oh , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah !
no big , i got it ! i &apos;m on it .
just a ... it was a painting .
that &apos;s not really how i wanted the weekend to go .
i thought the worst thing that could happen
was someone wouldn &apos;t like the cheese i brought .
i wanted it to be perfect .
jess , when nick said that you invited them
because you were nervous ...
no , don &apos;t worry about that .
jess , we &apos;re not perfect .
like the first time we slept together ,
like , i didn &apos;t even know your real name .
kind of a pretty sassy detail .
can we just concentrate on the fact that , like ,
i was tripping pretty hard on absinthe
and i said &quot; no &quot; to a stripper ?
i mean , a stripper was like rubbing my leg ...
that &apos;s weirdly ...
the most romantic thing i &apos;ve ever heard .
got it .
i left a post @-@ it note
on the transformer that said &quot; broken . &quot;
is there any way that we could make it look
like it was raccoon bites ?
a few announcements ?
angie left ... me .
what ?
she took the motorcycle ,
and , uh , a few of my belongings ,
but i &apos;m still wearing my underwear ,
so she comes up short @-@ handed in that treasure hunt .
seriously ? i &apos;m sorry , man .
oh , i &apos;m so sorry , nick .
it &apos;s fine . i &apos;m a grown man .
i will need a ride home .
yeah .
obviously .
i would love to pitch in with gas ,
but i don &apos;t have any money , so i could pay in &quot; nick bucks , &quot;
fully redeemable for smiles and any one item from my bureau .
we &apos;ll hold you to that .
thank you , doctor .
don &apos;t , i @-@ i &apos;m good .
i know you don &apos;t want to be hugged .
i don &apos;t want to be hugged .
and i respect that . so ...
okay . &apos; cause i &apos;m fine .
jess , no , i &apos;m good , i &apos;m good .
i promise you , i &apos;m good . just ...
actually , this is very weird for me .
i &apos;m not hugging you .
i know .
i &apos;m sorry .
i promise you i &apos;m okay .
stop making this a thing , because i &apos;m not sad .
this is for the best .
yeah .
i &apos;m fine .
she didn &apos;t deserve you .
whatever that means .
thank you .
okay , almost there .
hey , let &apos;s go !
all right .
hey , the potato salad &apos;s accidentally in the garbage .
look at that .
you guys mind if i eat this in the back seat ?
you can eat salad in my back seat anytime .
didn &apos;t mean that to be sexual .
all right , guys .
it &apos;s a little bit gamey .
okay . i &apos;ll get the garbage here .
hold on , hold on .
the absinthe .
you almost screwed that up by accident .
we &apos;re ready . you all right ?
yep , i &apos;ll be right with you guys .
that was a mistake ! whoo !
i am gonna poop weird tonight !
