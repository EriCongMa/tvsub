最坏的情况
crawford family . murdered 3 days ago .
saw it on the news .
they were found in the basement of their house .
bags packed for a vacation they never took .
report said it was a murder / suicide .
father stabbed the mom , then shot himself .
that &apos;s the conclusion maryland state police came to .
the gun was found next to the father .
had gunpowder residue on his right hand .
and now you must have some compelling reason
没有杀害他全家
yeah . another murdered family .
尸体在一个月前被发现
the mother reese miller ,
her 2 children , and her new husband .
again , they were found in the basement
也是收拾了行李准备度假
both cases , the bodies were discovered
5 days after their vacations were supposed to have started .
只有24小时
这两家人都还在家里
location of the bodies , both cases , the basement .
that indicates a level of organization .
就显得无组织了
if these aren &apos;t murder / suicides
someone &apos;s doing a damn good job of making them look like it .
埃里克 · 米勒
biological father of the miller children .
arlington p.d. issued a bolo for miller
after the bodies were discovered .
ex @-@ wife reese miller had a restraining order
against him for domestic violence .
when she get re @-@ married ?
the week before they were killed .
妻儿是属于自己的财产
reese miller getting re @-@ married possibly made him snap .
well , the virginia cops finally
located eric miller last night
responding to a drunken disturbance at a motel
where miller had been hiding out .
when they found him
they discovered blood on his black leather jacket .
belonged to his children .
was any of his dna found at the crawford house ?
no .
did he know the crawfords ?
if he does , he &apos;s not saying .
他就没说过一句话
uh , the arlington p.d. have asked us to interview him .
if anyone could apply overwhelming force , he &apos;s your man .
i want you to find out . talk to him .
you want me to talk to him ?
你就曾审讯过
you can go solo .
克劳福德家是最新的犯罪现场
once the crawfords were brought down to this basement
they must have known their fate .
m.e. said they were all killed down here .
艾米莉在那里
我是怎么做到的
well , i had to bring &apos; em down here first .
how ?
i had a gun .
接下来呢
先刺谁
the strongest , the father .
he was found right there , and then the mother .
that &apos;s her right there .
how you gonna keep the kids from running away ?
restraints .
can &apos;t aim a gun at them and stab the mother at the same time .
no restraints were found on the victims .
because i took them with me .
no ligature marks were found .
let &apos;s go upstairs . see how they lived .
sam crawford . white male .
age 5 . multiple stab wounds .
laceration to the left ventricle .
no defensive wounds present .
allison crawford . white female .
32 . multiple stab wounds .
c.o.d.- exsanguination .

where &apos;s his wedding ring ?
it &apos;s not listed in his personal effects .
那么戒指去哪里了
i &apos;m dr. spencer reid from the fbi .
i &apos;d like to ask you a few questions , if you don &apos;t mind .
you got something you wanna ask me , boy ?
you look me in the eye , and you ask .
three days ago ...
you &apos;re not looking at me .
three days ago , the crawford family was murdered .
is that right ?
did you know them ?
what are you getting at ?
they were killed in the exact same way that your family was killed .
and ?
弗吉尼亚警察刑讯逼供
what makes you think a damn photo is gonna scare me ?
is that what this is about , hmm ?
you think i &apos;m crazy , man ?
you think i suddenly snapped
and i slaughtered my own wife and kids ?
you think i did this ? huh ?
is that what you think ?
sit down , now .
is this your daddy ? !
我没什么可说的了
you don &apos;t have to talk . just listen .
on the occasions you assaulted your wife , you were intoxicated .
once the effects of alcohol wore off
you were overcome by feelings of remorse .
i &apos;m gonna tell you this just one time . you shut your mouth !
相互作用有一定的影响
your mother was an alcoholic
and she was often too drunk
to stop the beatings that your father gave you .
他还没说完
age 6 , you were orphaned to a family
where the abuse continued
only this time , it was sexual .
you shut your mouth , or i &apos;m gonna rip your face off .
the abuse continued well into puberty
but my one concern is , eric
继续这种恶心循环
i never laid a hand on my children .
you hear me ? !
i hear you .
i found them like that .
dead . bloodied . my babies .
my sweet , little babies .
i was crazy out of my mind . i didn &apos;t know what to do .
而事实确实如此
so you ran ?
so what &apos;ve i got now ?
you have your innocence .
for the sake of your children
i believe that they , at the very least , deserve the truth .
i can &apos;t get ... the image of my dead children out of my mind .
ty , my little boy
he was clutching a ... a piece of paper .
i think it was a drawing .
may- maybe a painting .
里德博士
interesting interrogation technique .
what did you hope to accomplish ?
而且很不友善
i needed a way in .
他杀害了自己的家人
and i know he still loved his wife .
why do you say that ?
even though they were divorced
he &apos;s still wore the wedding ring .
the yard is overgrown .
都该保养了
and allison crawford &apos;s suv is in pristine condition .
says here that allison drove the kids to school .
if they were educated privately
maybe the car was just an attempt to show the other parents wealth .
like this house .
designer magazines conspicuously placed
expensive modern furniture , plasma tv .
behind the curtains , water damage .
allison spent money on the things her friends could see
and neglected those they couldn &apos;t .
the crawfords lived beyond their means .
so , where &apos;d the extra cash come from ?
get garcia to check their financial status .
&quot; emily . &quot;
this painting is of this house .
strange for a child . it has no color .
has lines , dimensions , but no color .
no dog collar was found , right ?
maybe the dog didn &apos;t have one .
mm @-@ hmm . he &apos;d have to have one .
come here .
see that ?
this dog door opens automatically
via a chip in the dog &apos;s collar .
if anything attempted to get in without one ...
the alarm would &apos;ve been activated .
when the cops got here , the house was locked tight
and the alarm was hot .
so the night the crawfords were murdered
the only way in or out was with the dog collar .
杀了这家人
chris crawford was a black belt in judo .
so are you .
i &apos;ve got a gun to your back .
maybe you could take it from me .
but your children are in the same room .
and if you fail , they die .
does it matter how big i am now ?
艾莉森 · 克劳福德都会竭力反抗
emily and sam would &apos;ve been sobbing .
crawford didn &apos;t kill his family .
甚至可能根本不认识
求求你 救救我
别这样 求你了 不要
what are you doing ?
why didn &apos;t anyone hear them scream ?
i believe the unsub had control of this family .
he may have separated each family member .
我就杀了你的孩子 &quot;
我就杀了你们的妈妈 &quot;
控制他们的方法
based on lividity ...
the m.e. estimates that the father was the last to die .
which means he witnessed the whole thing .
if he did spend time with both families
他有时间与他们待在一起
&apos;cause he knew they were goin &apos; on vacation .
look at travel agents , relatives , work colleagues
contract workers , children &apos;s tutors .
克劳福德家的财政状况了
艾莉森 · 克劳福德的花销
they were in major debt .
and chris crawford wrote a number of checks
for a series of visits to a therapist .
she had 2 cell phone accounts ...
有一个在华盛顿东南部
you get that ?
federal agents ! fbi ! federal agents !
clear !
that &apos;s the cleanest thing in here .
clear .
what &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s a child &apos;s painting . it &apos;s a colonial house .
2个孩子在门外手牵手
and a big dog .
上面有艾米莉的签名
他儿子抓着一幅画
he wanted to know what was on it .
what was on it ?
his son &apos;s blood .
hotch ! hotch !
hey . whoa . whoa . easy .
freeze !
why am i here ?
i think you know why .
that &apos;s mine .
一种自信开朗的性格
shows an above @-@ average intelligence .
the child that painted this was left @-@ handed .
emily crawford was left @-@ handed .
right .
you &apos;re not .
how &apos;d you get the painting , frank ?
forget to take your medicine today , frank ?
这可不好
they make me feel wrong .
wrong enough to kill the crawfords ?
frank .
i- i did a @-@ a bad thing .
what did you do ?
i shouldn &apos;t have gone to the house .
allison told me not to .
i would never ... never hurt ally .
she &apos;s the only family i got .
family ?
she &apos;s my sister .
she &apos;s dead .
he killed them .
chris did . i know he did it .
what bad thing did you do ?
the rule was ... i was never supposed to go to the house .
that was the only rule .
allison said if chris saw me ...
he would never let me see her again .
he was gonna lock me up in the loony bin .
he never liked me .
you went ... to the house .
she said ... she couldn &apos;t visit me anymore .
i just wanted to see her .
seeing allison made everything better
but they cut my phone off .
that day ! the day i went to see them !
they cut my phone off !
i never would &apos;ve gone to the house
if they hadn &apos;t cut off the phone !
在没钥匙的情况下进入屋子
对他有偏见
没有
你都做了什么
it was ... dark . and- and cold .
透过窗户看屋里
but my breath steamed up the glass
and i wiped it clean , and ... and i-
i could see them , sitting down for dinner .
i saw emily and sam , and ...
sam was crying .
i guess he was in trouble .
did you see allison ?
yeah .
she was saying grace over the table .
and then ... she looked up and saw me .
and she mouthed something at me .
i think it was , &quot; get the hell out . &quot;
so i left .
did chris see you ?
no . he wasn &apos;t there .
but a friend was at the head of the table .
you said a friend ?
i saw someone .
what did this person look like ?
i- i didn &apos;t see their face ... but ... tiny .
really tiny .
white or black , frank ?
i don &apos;t know . but ...
what ?
the hair . it @-@ it ... it was red .
if frank saw them that day
it wasn &apos;t chris crawford at the table .
maybe it was the suspect .
and she wasn &apos;t saying , &quot; go away . &quot;
she was saying , &quot; help me . &quot;
it @-@ it wasn &apos;t a friend .
frank .
it wasn &apos;t a friend at all .
it was him .
he &apos;s the one who killed them .
frank .
i ... i ... i ... i ...
frank .
no ! no ! no ! no !
frank . frank . frank , frank , stop .
弗兰克 住手 放开
frank , calm down !
frank ! come on !
both families had a dog .
and both houses had a dog door .
fielding said that the person he saw was small .
yeah , well , in order to get through that door
还得非常瘦
&quot; when you have eliminated the impossible
即使是不可能 也一定是真相
sherlock holmes was a fictional character .
whoever did this isn &apos;t .
他现在已找好下一个下手目标了
let &apos;s just watch him sleep .
我们明天还有很多事情要做呢
can i kiss him ?
both of you , out .
明白 谢谢
he &apos;s been looking at those pictures all morning .
well , i sure hope he sees a connection
旅行社 家庭教师
contract workers . i got nothin &apos; .
why target those families ?
well , to know that , we have to know how .
通常都是技术工人
with above @-@ average intelligence .
high birth status .
and in most cases ... male .
in the workplace , he &apos;s socially confident .
and with women ... sexually confident .
every offense ... is preplanned .
targeting the victim is almost as pleasurable as the actual kill .
these guys , they &apos;re ... they &apos;re meticulous .
it &apos;s a compulsion .
everything has to have its proper place .
they do exhaustive amounts of research on their victims .
they watch their every move
every last detail is observed .
书上或日记上
when the kids are comin &apos; home from school .
when daddy &apos;ll be home .
洗澡时间 睡觉时间
plan the work ... work the plan .
this is the way that he maintains control .
it &apos;s also how he personalizes his target ...
so nothing &apos;s left to chance .
absolutely nothing ...
is left out of place , ever .
so he plans the work ...
就执行计划
he takes great pride in his job .
i think the workplace has to be the connection .
both are by emily , painted months apart .
this one ... is full of color , life .
the one i found at emily &apos;s house has
lines , dimensions . no color .
i believe emily was coerced to make this .
it &apos;s a point of view . it is his point of view .
监视这个家庭
each of the dead husbands was missing his wedding ring .
this is the unsub &apos;s trophy .
因为他失去了自己的家庭

因为没人会过来
because they &apos;re supposed to be on vacation .
克里斯 · 克劳福德穿的衣服内侧
the suspect may have worn the father &apos;s clothes to ...
complete the fantasy .
so , why kill them ?
&apos;cause the fantasy can &apos;t last .
这个混蛋的信息吗
wait a minute .
chris crawford worked for the irs .
and ... reese miller was a secretary at the gao .
that makes them both government employees .
let &apos;s check out chris crawford and reese miller .
he had his share of problems at home .
who doesn &apos;t ?
but he didn &apos;t fix &apos; em by killin &apos; his family .
were you aware he was in therapy ?
he mentioned a marriage counselor .
he say who ?
nope . and i didn &apos;t ask .
i don &apos;t like to pry .
真令人惊讶
you mind if we go through chris &apos;s belongings ?
see if he had any connection to miller ?
you &apos;re welcome to look through anything you like .
family therapists .
they often use children &apos;s paintings to assess the family unit .
we &apos;re all still in shock .
reese was a quiet woman .
上下班准点守时
brought in her own lunch , and she had 2 kids
but then you knew that .
it &apos;s just so terrible . i still can &apos;t believe it .
she was covering for one of my women who was on maternity leave .
and she was always tired , you know ?
都会很累
he was a mean drunk .
mrs. raleigh ...
她尽力不表露出来
but concealer can only do so much magic .
i should know .
mrs. raleigh .
i &apos;m tired . i &apos;m talking too much .
do you know if mrs. miller was seeing a marriage counselor ?
reese kept pretty much to herself .
you &apos;re not betraying any confidence .
we need to know everything about her life .
every thursday , i covered for her
so she could take off early to see a therapist .
thought it worked .
she kicked the bastard out , got remarried .
look what that got her .
人们会议论的
but then talk is cheap .
not when you &apos;re talkin &apos; to a therapist .
给苹果树家庭医疗中心
to the applewood family medical center .
what about the millers ?
no . nothin &apos; here .
how about pharmaceuticals ?
nobody gets therapy these days without a healthy dose of medication .
what are you implying , reid ?
that everyone is medicated .
did you just make a joke ?
no . i meant statistics .
里德 下次直接说 是
now , medication normally requires reimbursement from the hmo
and since she works for the government like you and i
we share the same health care provider .
are you hacking into the government &apos;s hmo database ?
is that legal ?
你会死得很惨
really ?
oh . right there . good call , reid .
mrs. reese miller- diazepam .
who prescribed the meds ?
dr. r. howard at the applewood family center .
let &apos;s find out what he looks like . here we go .
dr. howard isn &apos;t a he .
excellent , lacey . really wonderful .
there &apos;s so much color . it &apos;s very lovely , indeed .
dr. rachel howard ?
i &apos;m special agent aaron hotchner with the fbi .
come on , lacey . come on , go with mommy .
can i help you ?
i &apos;m agent jason gideon , behavioral analysis .
we both deal with the dysfunctional .
结局往往不会像你那么糟
unless you &apos;re the crawford family .
or the millers . you knew them both .
yes . i knew them , but ...
ma &apos;am .
i think you should take a seat .
why ?
we &apos;re gonna have to check your alibi .
dig all you want . i have 4 teenagers .
if i had any time to myself
it wouldn &apos;t be spent killing my clients .
you worked with both families ?
i assessed their cases .
this office deals with hundreds of families-- military
cops , lawyers , congressmen , feds .
i only met the crawfords and reese miller once .
but you prescribed medication for them .
i &apos;m the only medical doctor here .
who &apos;d you hand the cases over to ?
uh , i &apos;ll have to check my files .
you don &apos;t use a computer ?
not all of us have embraced the technical revolution .
这样让我更有安全感
and please ... do not read into that .
the crawfords .
karl arnold dealt with their case .
what about the millers ?
i &apos;d like to see him now .
well , you can &apos;t . he works a 4 / 40- 4.10 @-@ hour days .
he &apos;s off today , but he &apos;ll be in first thing tomorrow .
do you have his home address ?
i &apos;ll get a team out to his house .
in the meantime , we &apos;d like to see his office .
suspect &apos;s cell is goin &apos; straight to voice mail .
karl &apos;s a good man .
that &apos;s what everybody says
until they find a body in the basement .
it &apos;s locked .
i &apos;ll get security .
no . we don &apos;t have time for that .
someone will have to pay for that .
karl arnold will .
gideon .
where is he now ?
i can &apos;t believe karl ...
where is he ?
i don &apos;t know . if he &apos;s not at home ,
maybe he &apos;s gone to see his family .
he &apos;s married ?
小卡尔和莎拉
how long ago did the marriage collapse ?
about 5 years ago .
那段时间很痛苦 他 ...
he took some time off work .
he couldn &apos;t concentrate . he started ...
drinking .
yeah ?
也许你们弄错了
i would &apos;ve seen ...
oh , my god . i feel sick .
where does karl &apos;s family live ?
she took the kids and moved to idaho .
they just raided karl &apos;s home .
he &apos;s not there .
cut it out , now , both of you !
sarah , karl jr , go do your homework .
hello ?
wait . i &apos;m sorry . i can &apos;t hear @-@ shh !
what did you say ?
我是联邦探员亚伦 · 霍奇尔
i &apos;d like to know where your ex @-@ husband is .
as long as he &apos;s nowhere near me
i don &apos;t give a damn .
we really need to find him .
when was the last time you saw him ?
i ... i haven &apos;t seen him in over 2 years .
he ... he ... he &apos;s a scary guy .
but ... he did call me about an hour ago .
i wish he would just go to hell and stay there .
what did he say ?
家庭有多珍贵之类的话
did he say where he was ?
no . no . he ... he just wanted to talk to the kids .
让他想起了我的莎拉
焦虑 不知所措
seemed like he always is ...
angry , controlling , manic .
do you have any idea where he might be ?
但是我听见那边有孩子的声音
and ... and ... and then someone started to cry .
that &apos;s when he hung up .
thank you .
arnold just called his wife .
she heard kids in the background .
he &apos;s already in another family &apos;s house .
hotch , there &apos;s gotta be hundreds of families here .
我们就给每一家派去一名探员
karl arnold , he has a boy and a girl
just like the millers and the crawfords .
target family would be the same .
how could i not have seen it ?
若非如此
we would have caught him sooner .
does he have a journal ?
随身带着
it &apos;s likely he also collects trophies .
if they &apos;re not in his house
they &apos;re right here , hidden in this room .
what does he mean by trophies ?
from the families he killed .
我们需要那些战利品作为证据
一儿一女
can i see it ?
博耶兹一家和邓肯一家
wait . the dunkens .
that &apos;s not one of his cases . that &apos;s mine .
they have a baby boy
and a slightly introverted 8 @-@ year @-@ old
named jackie .
jackie ...
jackie &apos;s work ?
he took it from my office .
were they planning a trip ?
to the adirondacks .
霍奇 把这房间翻个底朝天
here , take this . i call you some backup .
坐在餐桌周围
fbi ! fbi !
he &apos;s got my baby !
ma &apos;am , is he alone ?
my baby !
where &apos;s the basement ?
under the stairs !
son of a bitch .
get &apos; em outta here . get them outta here !
gideon . gideon !
karl ?
karl , it &apos;s the fbi .
karl ?
why don &apos;t you give me the baby ?
karl ?
karl , i want you to look at me .
i &apos;m gonna put my gun away ...
and i want you to hand me that baby .
give me the baby .
you move , i &apos;m gonna break your neck .
hello .
let &apos;s go .
继续走
did he say anything ?
no .
can we tie him forensically to the other crimes ?
negative on foreign dna .
he must have washed crawford &apos;s clothes .
then we &apos;ll need a confession .
can you get one ?
did you do what i asked ?
yeah .
then maybe .
冰雪聪明 天赋异禀的女孩
阳光有活力的孩子
从院子里观察他们
you learned everything about them
studied their every move
and then you wrote it all down .
may i have a glass of water ?
something wrong ?
no , i &apos;m just thirsty .
water , please .
我对你显然不构成威胁
they stay on .
相类似的那些家庭
恐吓他们
then you killed them ... one by one .
we have your journals , karl .
it &apos;s my job ...
to write everything down , to get to know them .
我就无法帮助他们
and i make home visits ...
因为人们会撒谎
you , of all people , should know that .
糟糕的丈夫和父亲
allison crawford hemorrhaged money her husband didn &apos;t have .
it can strain any marriage .
on the surface , this looks like any family , usa .
一儿一女
if you look a little closer
却与表象不符
the woman and children are distant from the man .
their smiles are stiff . their eyes are frightened .
every hair is in place , wearing their sunday best
生活在地狱里的人一样
are you okay ?
it isn &apos;t right .
what isn &apos;t ?
you &apos;ve got the pictures mixed up !
那是山姆 · 克劳福德的
it should be ty miller &apos;s !
必须放在正确的位置
this one here ?
what the hell have i been trying to tell you ?
you &apos;re right . they &apos;re switched .
和米勒一家放在了一起
but how did you know that , karl ?
and i watched them for a number of days ,
always at night .
saw how they lived . how they loved .
i would keep them apart ...
until the last night , till the last supper .
then i would bring them , one by one ...
down to the basement .
the youngest first . the father last .
why , karl ?
so he could see ...
what happens to families
when the head of household ... isn &apos;t strong .
wives wither .
children perish .
but me ?
i &apos;m an excellent father .
