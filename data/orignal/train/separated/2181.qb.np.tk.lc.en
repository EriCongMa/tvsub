grace ?
what are you doing in my house ?
who are you ?
i &apos;m marco reyes .
your brother never mentioned me to you ?
what is it that i can do for you ?
your brother took something from me .
and you &apos;re gonna help me get it back .
when your brother disappeared ,
he was in possession of a significant amount of my money .
okay , how much money ?
18 and a half million dollars .
well , i , unfortunately , don &apos;t know anything about that .
i haven &apos;t seen or spoken to my brother in three years .
do you really think that i &apos;m the kind of guy
who doesn &apos;t get what he wants ?
i strongly suggest that
you just get on a plane and never come back .
as soon as i get my money ,
that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;ll do .
i don &apos;t know where your money is . i don &apos;t have it .
matthew tells a very different story .
of course people tend to say anything
when they have a gun to their head .
marco reyes has my brother .
what are you talking about ? matt ?
yeah , how do you ... how do you know ?
what did he say exactly ?
he said that he has him , he put a gun to his head and ...
i don &apos;t know what he said ,
he has my brother . ok ?
did matt tell you where that money is ?
no , he did not tell me where the money is .
then how do you know reyes wasn &apos;t bluffing , okay ?
telling you he had matt to get you to turn over that cash ?
okay , uh , what if he &apos;s not ?
danny , your brother &apos;s been a fugitive for three years , okay ?
if that money existed ,
he &apos;d be using it to stay under the radar .
and if that &apos;s the case , reyes doesn &apos;t have your brother ,
because he &apos;d know where the money is .
what the hell are you talking about ?
what , are you trying to confuse me ?
i &apos;m angry . you want to make me more angry ?
what does that mean ?
listen to me : my point is ,
if matt stole 18 and a half million dollars ,
maybe reyes is rattling your cage
to see if you know where your brother is .
and if that &apos;s the case , i say ,
you rattle back .
aloha .
aloha .
for those of you who just joined us , aloha kakahiaka !
couldn &apos;t have picked a better day
to see the enchanting beauty of oahu .
the name &quot; oahu &quot; means &quot; the gathering place , &quot;
and it certainly lives up to its name .
there &apos;s so much to see and experience
in just under 600 square miles .
aloha .
aloha .
aloha .
so , on our right , is the exquisite
moana surfrider resort and spa .
opened in 1901,
this legendary landmark is known as the
&quot; first lady of waikiki . &quot;
aloha .
aloha .
aloha .
further down on your right , keep your eye out
for one of our most popular sights on waikiki beach ,
the duke kahanamoku statue .
duke is one of the most beloved legends in hawaiian history .
hollywood actor , olympic legend
and the father of modern @-@ day surfing .
so , take a picture , leave your leis , and rub ...
don &apos;t move . pull over .
i said , pull over ! now !
donation time .
what ?
that &apos;s right ! this is a gun !
it puts holes in people .
now if you don &apos;t want to leave this island in a box ,
you &apos;ll do as we say .
everyone , pass your valuables to my new friend here .
now !
phones , wallets , cameras , jewelry--
get &apos; em out ! pass everything to the aisle !
let &apos;s go ! let &apos;s go ! come on , move it ! move it !
hand it over .
let &apos;s go ! move it !
get &apos; em out . pass everything to the aisle !
you , aloha shirt gone bad ...
get up .
please .
now ! wallet , cell phone-- hand it over , come on .
nathan ! nathan !
nathan ! nathan !
where &apos;s the brains ?
what are you talking about ?
williams . he &apos;s the brains .
you &apos;re the brawn .
okay . what does that make you ?
me ? come on , man .
i &apos;m the pretty face .
danny &apos;s got some personal stuff he had to take care of .
the reyes thing , right ?
yeah .
sounds to me like that cat has a problem
taking no for an answer .
yeah , and he doesn &apos;t know danny . trust me .
if this thing &apos;s real ,
reyes is gonna wish they never met .
hi , guys .
so , we &apos;re up here .
not exactly your picture @-@ perfect postcard
of a tropical dream vacation .
what do we know about our vic ?
his name is nathan wagner .
he &apos;s president of a major i.t. security firm
specializing in encryption , network administration
and some type of hi @-@ tech firewall
that i &apos;m not even going to try to pronounce .
he was here for a tech conference .
he tried to resist ,
and one of the perps put a slug in his chest .
and his wife monica caught a round in the arm .
please just let me see my husband .
mrs. wagner , there &apos;s nothing you can do for him now .
i just want to see him one more time .
i &apos;m so sorry .
what about the shooters ?
three women , early 20 &apos;s
a redhead , brunette and a blonde .
they were all wearing bikinis , backpacks , sunglasses and hats .
oh , good . that , uh , really narrows it down .
all right . so , as soon as they got off the bus ,
they blended right into the crowd .
you know , these girls are pulling old @-@ school stagecoach robberies .
it &apos;s a lot of exposure , but they &apos;re also smart .
hpd has them hitting four tour buses
in the past six months ,
but they &apos;re switching it up every time .
different outfits , different buses , times and stops .
but they never hurt anyone .
yeah , until now .
kono , i want traffic cam footage .
get hpd out there shaking the trees .
canvass every pawn shop on the island .
let &apos;s see if they &apos;re moving the stolen merch
through online sites or known fences .
probably wouldn &apos;t hurt to compile a list
of the passengers &apos; cell phones .
might be able to lock onto a gps signal .
that &apos;s good .
on it .
what about the wife ? she give you anything ?
yeah . good look at the shooter
after her sunglasses came off in the struggle .
after she &apos;s released from the hospital ,
i &apos;ll put her in front of some photos .
all right . so our vic puts up a fight ,
and ends up in the morgue .
i &apos;m sure these girls weren &apos;t expecting resistance ,
but it &apos;s clear they &apos;re not gonna hesitate to pull the trigger .
with all due respect , commander ,
i think nathan wagner was a lot more than a random victim .
if you &apos;re soliciting opinions , i mean .
does dr. bergman concur ?
he &apos;s back at the ranch .
took the training wheels off , is letting me fly solo on this one .
good for you .
welcome to the big leagues .
all right , kid , you &apos;re up .
i think your victim was actually the target of this robbery .
during my preliminary examination ,
i ran als over the deceased , and i discovered this .
well , i can &apos;t imagine the perps were carrying an als ,
so , what makes you think they saw it ?
these uv glasses .
csu recovered them on the top deck of the bus .
witnesses said they saw one of our suspects wearing them .
all right , let &apos;s check ,
see if anybody else on the bus was marked .
i already did . he &apos;s the only one .
that &apos;s impressive work , dr. shaw .
mahalo , commander .
so , if this guy &apos;s clothes were marked
before he got on the bus ,
these girls had help .
all right . well , wagner and his wife
were both staying at the grand aupuni , right ?
i &apos;ll contact the hotel , put together an exact timeline
of their day before they ended up here .
this guy &apos;s a successful business man , right ?
so , any property or cash that was taken from him
could easily have been replaced .
why put up a fight ?
not to mention , the guy &apos;s with his wife .
only reason i can even see him putting her in danger is
if these girls were after something he couldn &apos;t replace .
whatever it was ...
cost him his life .
matty .
matty .
matthew williams , hey !
gonna shoot me , danny ?
i should shoot you , you stupid son of a bitch !
huh ? laundering money for drug dealers ? !
what the hell &apos;s the matter with you ?
i had no choice .
you did have a choice . you had a choice .
i gave you a choice . i said i was gonna help you .
i said i was gonna get you through this , didn &apos;t i ?
this ends one of two ways , big brother .
you either shoot me , or you say good @-@ bye .
i know you &apos;re supposed to be good at your job ,
but i see you everywhere i go .
well , it &apos;s not an accident , you know ?
you &apos;re wasting your time .
it &apos;d be better spent going out and getting my money .
your money , okay . well , here &apos;s the thing .
screw you . screw your money .
you say you got my brother ? where is he ?
matty &apos;s gonna be fine as long as i get what i want .
yeah ?
you know i could ... press charges for that , detective .
yeah ?
but that would only waste more time .
my money ... for your brother .
you see , here &apos;s the thing , i don &apos;t believe you , okay ?
you are bluffing .
do you really want to take that chance ?
okay ... okay , then i want to talk to matt .
when i get what i came here for .
look , i fly home tonight .
you have until monday to bring my money to this address .
that &apos;s three days .
okay , what happens if i don &apos;t bring you the money ?
you &apos;ll get a package with your brother &apos;s head in it .
have a nice rest of your day , detective .
your suspects were wearing these wigs .
hpd found them dumped near the crime scene .
okay , they tell you anything ?
i was able to recover human hair samples from all three .
nice .
your suspects are actually two brunettes and a blonde .
okay , tell me you have a hit in codis ,
and lunch is on me .
sorry , their dna wasn &apos;t in the system .
but i did find something else for you .
i &apos;ve recovered a substance from the back
of our vic &apos;s shirt sleeve--
likely transferred from the perp to our victim
during the struggle .
it contained elements of beeswax , paraffin and pine resin .
that &apos;s surf wax .
and i think i have an idea of
where our shooter catches her breaks .
i am gonna end up buying you lunch , aren &apos;t i ?
i found traces of sand embedded in the surf wax .
it contains a higher ratio of olivine to carbonate
than most sand on the island .
and it can be found
in one particular place in great abundance :
right off diamond head .
south shore .
fong , you &apos;re a rock star .
pick a day-- shrimp &apos;s on me .
we ran nathan wagner &apos;s credit cards .
there &apos;s been no activity since before the robbery .
according to the last receipt ,
he spent breakfast at the hotel restaurant
just prior to boarding the tour bus .
okay , well , if he didn &apos;t leave the hotel
before he got on that bus ,
somebody must &apos;ve marked him there .
which means someone at the hotel is working with these girls ,
whoever that was , they did recon on nathan wagner ,
i.d. &apos; d him as a whale ,
and marked him before he left the hotel this morning .
you wanted a smoking gun ? well , chew on this .
not that one chews on a gun .
i &apos;m kind of mixing metaphors there , but you get the point .
also , hi . how &apos;s it going ?
hey , lou , give us a minute ?
i got a feeling you &apos;re gonna need more than one .
okay .
jerry , this has got to stop .
okay .
i know i said i &apos;d back off , but ...
i couldn &apos;t help myself--
curiosity got the best of me .
okay , what you call curiosity ,
the law calls stalking , jer .
but this guy is counterfeiting money . i &apos;m sure of it .
look , the shop gets regular deliveries on monday and thursday .
rare books from the mainland--
we know that &apos;s how he &apos;s sourcing his paper
for the counterfeit bills .
nope , we don &apos;t know that .
stay with me .
because last friday there was a break in the pattern .
random delivery-- definitely not books .
so i did a little dumpster diving , and ...
hey , and surprise , you found some garbage .
not garbage ; a delivery slip .
the guy is now the proud owner
of a brand @-@ new inkjet printer using optimized dpi .
dots per inch . trust me , it &apos;s important .
okay , so what you &apos;re saying is , uh ,
the only thing this printer can be used for
is making counterfeit money .
well , no , of course not ,
but 60 % of all counterfeit bills recovered in the past year
were made on printers just like this one .
jerry ...
steve , the guy &apos;s got a stockpile of old paper
and a badass printer .
all he needs is the right kind of ink and he &apos;s printing benjamins .
yeah , except hpd &apos;s got nothing on this guy .
thomas farrow is clean . his business is legit .
there &apos;s no evidence at all of any counterfeiting .
no evidence ? what do you think you &apos;re looking at ?
nothing .
nothing , jerry . you &apos;re gonna get yourself into trouble .
i see .
listen , listen to me . hey ,
i &apos;m trying to protect you , all right ?
just &apos; cause you want to believe something doesn &apos;t make it true .
i understand .
have a wonderful afternoon ...
commander .
you &apos;re joking .
hey , don &apos;t look at me-- this is mcgarrett &apos;s idea .
i &apos;m not wearing this .
these girls are surfers ,
we know where they hang out .
the only way we &apos;re gonna find them is
if they don &apos;t see us coming . what &apos;s the problem ?
okay , then it falls on me ?
well , you &apos;re the surfer , ain &apos;t ya ?
yeah . plus , you &apos;re the only one who can walk down on that beach
without broadcasting &quot; cop &quot;
hey , listen , we need eyes out there , okay ?
somebody on that beach must know who these girls are ,
plus , the alternative is grover in a speedo .
couple of years ago , i could &apos;ve pulled it off ,
but , well , you know .
fine . but i pick the suit .
fine .
that &apos;ll be five dollars .
okay , thank you very much .
hey , what &apos;s up ?
that was the grand aupuni , where our vic was staying .
according to the hotel manager ,
wagner was staying there alone .
alone ?
what about his wife ?
well ... according to this ,
she died five months ago , from cancer .
then who the hell was the woman on the bus ?
mrs. wagner .
i @-@ i &apos;m , uh , i &apos;m so sorry for your loss .
how can i help you ?
i &apos;m trying to make arrangements to have my husband &apos;s body sent home .
lieutenant kelly told me i should come down here .
yeah , of course .
please , uh , have a seat .
so it turns out our mrs. wagner is actually an ex @-@ con
by the name of vanessa hansen .
she &apos;s worn bracelets in multiple states .
grand larceny , forgery , fraud ,
mostly white @-@ collar stuff .
never did any significant time .
it &apos;s possible she &apos;s working with our girls .
yeah , but why stick around
the crime scene pretending to be wagner &apos;s wife ?
i mean , she had to know we &apos;d find out who she was .
right ? why take a chance ?
yeah . mcgarrett .
dr. shaw , slow down , slow down .
what happened ?
i was not expecting to see the wife .
she came in , i gave her a moment alone ,
and after she left , i started my examination and i found this .
wasn &apos;t here when he was brought in .
she took his thumbprint .
wait a minute , that &apos;s why vanessa hansen
stuck around the crime scene and pretended to be his wife--
she needed that print .
our vic owns an i.t. security firm .
he &apos;s got clients on the fortune 500 list .
no telling what that print would get her access to .
okay , wait a minute . what are the odds ?
all right , hansen targets nathan wagner on that tour bus ,
but right before she can get what she wants ,
there &apos;s a stickup .
right .
got a better chance of getting struck by lightning .
yeah , or winning the lottery .
plus , there &apos;s no evidence that she &apos;s working
with our little all @-@ girl wild bunch .
all right , we treat this as two separate crimes .
good to see you , little sistah .
hey . howzit , mamo ?
long time no .
yeah .
you know , i sit out here every day watching these young kids ,
and not one of them , not one ...
can shred those waves like you .
i was all right . that was a long time ago , mamo .
all right ? you were the best .
so , what brings you to my beach ?
come to show these clowns how it &apos;s done ?
well , unfortunately , i &apos;m not here for the surf ;
i &apos;m on the job .
i &apos;m looking for three girls-- late teens , early 20s .
two brunettes and one blonde .
look around . you got your pick out here .
yeah , well , they &apos;re most likely kama &apos;aina .
probably surf here all the time .
the swells were coming in from the west this morning .
but the wind shifted .
now the best breaks are coming in from the south .
if they &apos;re true kanaka maoli ...
that &apos;s where they &apos;ll be .
okay .
it &apos;s good to see you , mamo .
mahalo .
anytime , sistah . you be careful .
malama aku no .
go show &apos; em how it &apos;s done !
alert &apos;s out on vanessa hansen .
hpd &apos;s sitting on her house now .
believe me , she knows we &apos;re onto her .
so i doubt she &apos;s going home .
now , where are we with wagner &apos;s thumbprint ?
well , i spoke to one of the partners at his firm .
he uses it as a biometric key .
it allows him to access files
that contain highly sensitive information about his clients .
well , information like that on blue @-@ chip companies
could be very valuable to someone
who knows how to leverage it .
you better believe it . that &apos;s what vanessa hansen &apos;s after .
that &apos;s my guess .
company &apos;s notifying its clients of a potential breach .
all right , we get any word from kono on our surfer girls ?
nothing yet .
hpd &apos;s still running background on any hotel employee
that might have had access to the vic &apos;s room .
whoever marked wagner
should lead us to our crew .
it &apos;s dc .
that &apos;s for me .
i put a call in to the secret service for jerry .
you guys give me a second , please ?
sure .
agent keane . thanks for getting back to me .
no good waves ?
surf report said it was firing out here this morning .
do we know you ?
no . just making friendly conversation .
well , take your friendly conversation someplace else .
you got a problem , sistah ?
no , it &apos;s all good .
everything &apos;s cool .
that &apos;s just some nasty bruise you got there .
cop .
where do you think you &apos;re going ?
let go of me .
that was the most fun i had on a board in a long time .
don &apos;t look at me like that .
i just did you a huge favor .
first one in gets the deal .
all you have to do is tell me who your friends are
and where i can find &apos; em .
i want a lawyer .
yeah .
you &apos;re gonna need one .
&apos;cause we found the wigs that you dumped after the robbery .
and there &apos;s still strands of your hair inside .
so when i compare your dna to that hair sample ,
we both know you &apos;re going down for this .
lea , lea .
i know exactly who you are .
you never finished high school .
you &apos;d rather chase the waves than get a real job ,
so you just knock off some , uh , unsuspecting haoles
to make ends meet .
is this the part where you tell me you used to be like me ?
that we &apos;re not all that different ?
no , this is the part where i tell you i know
your cousin works as a bellhop at the grand aupuni .
the same hotel
where the man you and your friends murdered was staying .
&apos;cause that &apos;s how you &apos;ve been doing this .
he picks out the big fish ,
lets you know when they book a bus tour .
he gets into their room ,
marks their clothes and you
hey , five @-@ o !
and your friends do the rest .
didn &apos;t your mother tell you to look both ways ?
come on . let &apos;s go to jail .
it &apos;s over , lea .
this is the most important decision of your life .
if you ever want to surf a break again ,
tell me where your friends are .
go to hell .
hey , you got a sec ?
not getting anywhere .
doesn &apos;t matter-- we don &apos;t need her .
the cousin just flipped on the other two girls .
we got an address .
let &apos;s go .
five @-@ 0 ! freeze !
steve ! i got movement !
vanessa hansen ! freeze !
go , go , go !
no , vanessa hansen didn &apos;t just stop by for a friendly visit .
she was looking for something .
well , gotta be something them girls took off nathan wagner .
wallet ... maybe his phone ...
oh , yeah . his phone .
she needed his thumbprint to access his phone .
well , whatever &apos;s on that thing ,
hansen &apos;s willing to kill for it .
and she &apos;s not gonna stop until she gets it .
we find those girls , we find vanessa hansen .
all right !
when was this caught ?
this morning .
any fresher you &apos;d be eating it underwater .
sure about that ?
choose your next words carefully , bruddah .
it &apos;s okay .
i &apos;m not hungry anyway .
i &apos;m here for a favor .
you are five @-@ 0 .
what &apos;s going on , man ?
there &apos;s a , uh , vintage bookshop in town
that &apos;s a cover for a counterfeiting operation .
that &apos;s no joke .
my cousin bobo used a home printer and bleach
to turn fives into 50 .
now he &apos;s doing 20 up in halawa .
let me guess-- he forgot to change lincoln to grant ?
you tell mcgarrett about this ?
of course , but he &apos;s convinced there &apos;s nothing going on in there .
which is why i need some hard evidence .
i don &apos;t read . i &apos;m more of a visual guy .
it &apos;s not for you .
it &apos;s my way to get ears inside the operation .
there &apos;s a listening device implanted in the spine .
i just need someone to walk into that store and sell it for me .
how do you know they &apos;re even gonna want to buy this thing ?
it &apos;s not even in english .
it &apos;s latin , it &apos;s rare , it &apos;s worth a grand , easy .
so if you let it go for a couple hundred bucks ,
they &apos;re not gonna say no .
you got legs .
i can &apos;t do it . i &apos;m too close to this thing .
i need an op with undercover experience .
chin told me you helped five @-@ o with a situation a few years back .
yeah , and i almost ended up worm food .
so with all due respect to my existence ,
my various thriving enterprises ,
i &apos;m gonna have to pass . sorry , brah .
w @-@ wait , wait , wait . just hear me out .
have you ever been sure of something ?
something you knew to be true ,
but no one believed you ?
starting my own business .
going legit .
you should have seen the looks that i got .
and i &apos;m not just talking about my friends .
now i got a truck ,
shave ice stand , helicopter ,
and a few other tricks up my sleeve .
there , you see ?
i mean , at least you had a chance to prove everyone wrong .
my dad ...
was a brilliant engineer .
all he ever wanted to do was build things better .
when the company he was working for started to take shortcuts
and put people at risk , he went to his boss .
nothing happened .
two months later , he went to the division supervisor .
same response . silence .
four months later , he went to the president of the company .
and two days after that , they promoted him .
they paid him to shut up ?
my father lived the rest of his life with the regret
of not having done the right thing .
i watched how it ate away at him .
how weak it made him feel .
compromising his integrity instead of doing what was right .
i loved my father ,
but that &apos;s not gonna be me .
i &apos;m not gonna shut up
and i &apos;m not gonna walk away from this .
i &apos;m in .
gonna do this .
thank you .
i don &apos;t think you understand , lea .
if those people find keilani and alana before we do ,
they &apos;re as good as dead .
okay , look , you stole a cell phone from the guy
who was killed on the bus this morning , all right ?
some very dangerous people are trying to find it .
is that right ?
lea ...
you recognize this place ?
that guy was tearing apart your house .
and he wasn &apos;t the type to surrender , okay ?
now , if your two friends
had shown up instead of us ,
it would &apos;ve been them in that photo .
these people will not hesitate to kill to get what they &apos;re after ,
so if you know where your friends are ,
you need to tell us .
keilani &apos;s tutu has a house up in waimanalo .
we always said if things went bad , that &apos;s where we &apos;d go .
would you please sit down .
you &apos;re stressing me out .
pardon me for being human . i killed a guy today .
it was his idea to play hero .
it was either him or you .
doesn &apos;t matter .
dead is dead . and the cops know who we are .
so yeah , i &apos;m a little stressed .
we &apos;re gonna be fine .
they got lea .
relax . she &apos;s not gonna tell the cops anything .
sit down .
i said sit down !
good . now that i have your attention ...
i want the stuff you stole this morning .
where &apos;s the rest of it ?
i don &apos;t know ...
gun ! second story !
got it .
stay down !
take another step and she dies .
from the looks of that wound ,
she &apos;s already got one foot in the grave .
the way she &apos;s leaking blood ,
i give her about ten minutes before it &apos;s both .
i will put a bullet in her head right now .
go ahead .
we don &apos;t give a damn about her . or you .
i &apos;ll tell you what ,
when she &apos;s done bleeding out ,
why don &apos;t you come out front and we &apos;ll talk , all right ?
i got her .
i &apos;m going inside .
central , this is captain grover , five @-@ o.
i have a gsw victim , heavy bleeder , conscious .
i need a medevac .
put a rush on it .
so it turns out that one of nathan wagner &apos;s clients
was union liberty bank .
he managed the data transfer codes ,
which he kept stored on his phone .
what ? !
well , that doesn &apos;t seem like a very savvy way
to secure valuable information , especially for a tech guy .
yeah , but this wasn &apos;t just any phone--
it was equipped with a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art firewall
that made it resistant to hacking .
the only way in was his thumbprint .
vanessa hansen was gonna use those codes
to drain millions from the bank .
well , that would explain why wagner put up a fight .
so she said she followed him from the hotel to the bus ...
... put a gun in his side ,
said &quot; we &apos;re gonna get off in a few stops ,
where there was a car waiting
with a laptop inside to do a wire transfer to an offshore account . &quot;
those girls had no idea what they were walking into
when they got onto that bus .
for them , life as they knew it was simple .
it was waking up every day
with a desire to catch a better wave
than the day before .
the adrenaline you feel paddling out
knowing that at any time you could get the ride of your life .
and then there &apos;s the rush of walking on water .
only gods do that .
everything they did was to preserve that life .
to surf is to get up every day
with a desire to battle something greater than yourself .
and those girls just wanted to ride that wave as long as they could .
and now their endless summer is over .
hey . come on .
heard you solved the case .
kudos .
yeah , thanks , man .
uh , thanks for coming by , too .
look , i , um ... i felt bad about the way we left things this morning ,
so i called in a favor .
i had my friend at secret service run thomas farrow
through their counterfeiting unit .
i &apos;m sorry , but , uh , he &apos;s clean , jerry .
well , i guess no one &apos;s right 100 % of the time .
you bet .
can i ask you something ?
of course .
do you think i &apos;m a crackpot ?
no . absolutely not .
listen , you &apos;ve been right about so many things :
the medici rings ,
the black unicorn , my champ box ...
yeah , well , not that i &apos;m keeping score or anything .
yeah , but we are , jerry .
you &apos;ve become an incredible asset to this team .
i don &apos;t want you getting in trouble over something stupid like this .
you know ?
you &apos;re &apos; ohana now .
bring it in , man . come on .
thanks for this , mcgruff .
glad i could put your mind at ease .
it &apos;s on .
good evening , sir .
can i help you with something ?
my uncle passed away recently .
i found this in his attic .
looks like it might be worth something .
lecanto &apos;s doctrinam de homine ,
originally published in 1590 .
this looks to be an early 17th century edition
with , uh , quarter vellum and speckled paper sides .
well , your uncle had most excellent taste .
thanks .
now , how much for the book ?
well , um , it &apos;s certainly a strong copy
with a very pleasing provenance .
may i handle it ?
absolutely .
just be careful with it , brah .
i certainly will .
all those provinces good , brah ?
most impressive .
well , then , um ...
i am prepared to offer you ...
$ 300 .
i &apos;m prepared to accept ...
no less than $ 400 .
hmm . you drive rather a hard bargain , sir .
you have yourself a deal .
cheers .
mahalo , brother .
hey . i tried calling you before . you didn &apos;t pick up .
what &apos;s going on ? what happened with reyes ?
he gave me till monday to @-@ to get him his money ,
and , steve , i do not think that he is ... he &apos;s lying .
i think that , um ... i think he has matt .
okay .
then , uh , i vote we go to colombia and get him back .
no , that we can &apos;t do , all right ?
this guy reyes is the type of guy i think he is ,
uh , he &apos;s gonna have an army around him .
if we go down there , matt &apos;s dead before we get in the front door .
but , uh , i think i may have
a @-@ a ... another way of getting matt back .
how &apos;s that ?
how ? uh , i pay him his money .
you mean the money that doesn &apos;t exist ?
you say it doesn &apos;t exist .
i &apos;m starting to think that maybe it does .
in fact , i &apos;m thinking it &apos;s right here on this island .
now , wait , what are you talking about ?
just stick with me here for a second .
three years ago , matt gets on that plane .
okay ? not a single piece of luggage .
but he &apos;s supposed to have $ 18.5 million .
if that &apos;s the case , then it &apos;s here on the island .
correct ?
okay .
so , say he did-- so what ?
how are you supposed to find it ?
about a month after he disappeared ,
he sent me a postcard-- matt .
yeah ? what &apos;d it say ? did it mention the money ?
no , he didn &apos;t mention the money .
he just wrote &quot; wish you were here . &quot;
it &apos;s a picture of this remote area on oahu .
&quot; wish you were here &quot; with a rock formation
and a couple of ... couple of palm trees .
hold on . i &apos;m gonna take a picture . hold on .
did you get it ? &quot; wish you were here . &quot;
so at first , i &apos;m just angry , right ?
i mean , this is all this guy &apos;s got to say
after everything that happened ? &quot; i wish you were here &quot; ?
that &apos;s all i get ? you know , i was confused .
i don &apos;t understand why he sent it .
then i looked at it again today .
it started to make a little bit more sense .
maybe he was sending me the postcard to tell me
where the location of the money is .
danny ...
i know , i know , i know .
i &apos;m crazy , right ?
but i think literally that the money could be
directly at the spot on the postcard .
okay , so wait a minute ,
you think this whole postcard is @-@ is some kind of a ...
is a treasure map , yes . uh , i know .
go ahead . say it . i &apos;m crazy .
no , i &apos;m not gonna do that .
i appreciate that .
hey , danny ,
i can be there in less than two hours
to come help you dig it up .
no , no , no , no , no .
don &apos;t worry about it . listen ...
i &apos;m already here , and it might be nothing .
all right ?
all right , well ,
if you find something , give me a call .
all right , you got it .
