第二季第七集
ready for the bus driver , wouldn &apos;t you ?
you know why they call me the bus driver , right ?
because you been travelin &apos; all day ?
because i &apos;m taking your butt to school .
nice .
cool , i &apos;m up .
nuh @-@ uh . game &apos;s to 15 .
since when ?
since you scored 11 .
sorry , abed , i have to finish kicking troy &apos;s butt
before i can get to yours .
see ? all that angry talk about butts .
&quot; kick your butt . stomp your butt . &quot;
&quot; punch your butt . &quot;
do they say , &quot; punch your butt &quot; ?
point being
hatred of each other &apos;s butts .
men play sports so they can seek out and destroy
their own sensitivity .
oh ! i never thought about it that way .
do you think we &apos;ll learn about stuff like that
in our women &apos;s studies class ?
hell , no !
we &apos;re gonna find our roots in that class .
and stop defining our gender by theirs .
well , i feel bad saying it ,
but it will be nice to get away from the boys
and take a class with just us .
amen . or &quot; a @-@ wo @-@ men . &quot;
am i right ?
bring it in for a boob bump , ladies .
nope ?
we &apos;ll get there .
hey , guys .
remember last week when you were
playing with those remote control cars
and you thought you were real cool ?
well , turns out you &apos;re not .
draganflyer , bee @-@ otch .
yep , uh , four propellers .
it &apos;s got a built @-@ in spy cam .
range , 100 yards .
and it &apos;ll strangle your stupid cars &apos; little butts .
pierce , we &apos;re in a game .
yeah .
and we &apos;re really not into r.c. anymore .
what ? it &apos;s-- it &apos;s a draganflyer .
come on , pierce , man . this is a school .
i can &apos;t control it .
there &apos;s a little pilot in there .
it &apos;s not funny , pierce !
propellers are sharp !
stop it !
knuckle walkers !
sorry , it was an accident .
so was the &quot; y &quot; chromosome ,
but you don &apos;t see us throwing stuff at it .
where you guys going ?
away from your symbolically invasive balls
to a women &apos;s studies class .
which women &apos;s studies class ?
feminist representations in media .
i &apos;m in .
oh , uh , abed ,
we kind of thought this would be something just for the girls .
sounds like it .
i &apos;d love to learn more about you .
i &apos;ll change out of my sports clothes and meet you there .
you just lost
you just lost a game
you just lost
you just lost a game
with troy
hey , sore loser .
yeah ... proud of it .
i want a rematch .
hey , guys .
i raced here so i could save us four seats .
thanks , abed .
but ... annie can &apos;t see the board
from this far back .
she lost her glasses .
i &apos;ve never seen you wear glasses .
yeah , i usually wear contacts ,
but i couldn &apos;t find them ... without my glasses .
which i wear .
cool @-@ cool @-@ cool .
are we bad people ?
no . i love abed .
but sometimes he can &apos;t take a hint .
we told him-- this is a girl thing .
&apos;scuse me .
we were gonna sit there .
oh , uh , sorry . we didn &apos;t know .
but now we &apos;re sitting here , so ...
that &apos;s the problem .
you don &apos;t seriously expect us to get up
and change seats for you ?
well , if you &apos;re further in back ,
less people will see your roots .
um ... excuse me ?
oh , the way you excuse your little moustache hairs ?
uh , you know what ?
we &apos;re good people .
so we will find seats elsewhere .
it &apos;s called the high road .
i hope it leads to a salon .
you &apos;re back .
i &apos;ve seen &apos; em before . the leader &apos;s name is meghan .
of course ! why name your daughter meghan ?
are you stocking up for a bitch shortage ?
which one &apos;s meghan ?
the one with the hole in her sweater &apos;s armpit ,
or the one whose tight sleeves are pushing her fat toward her elbows ?
no , those are her cronies .
so meghan &apos;s the one with the crooked ears and no angles ?
ha ! damn .
sorry , i over @-@ described again ?
oh , no , abed .
describe those girls all you want .
yeah . in fact , what are you doing for lunch ?
it &apos;s wednesday . sometimes i eat in jeff &apos;s car .
don &apos;t tell him .
troy , where are you ?
you would go this far to avoid a rematch ?
jeff !
what is this thing ?
in my line of work ,
a multimillion dollar injury suit .
i thought schools got rid of these things .
i can &apos;t believe greendale allows it .
greendale doesn &apos;t .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s hidden .
who else saw you come in ?
if we say nobody ,
are you doing to stab us with your bush scissors ?
of course not .
i &apos;m joshua .
and this is a place of peace and balance .
a place of nourishment .
a place free from darkness .
because there &apos;s a trampoline ?
there is something cool about being up here , jeff .
i mean , at first i was just jumping , but then ...
but then you started bouncing ...
like a baby on the knee of a goddess .
yes !
yes .
jeff , get on .
ah , one at a time , please .
i must as you to adhere to two simple principles .
first , for this place to survive ,
it must stay secret .
and second ...
no double bounces .
feet shoulder width apart .
knees bent .
and just breathe .
at the apex of each bounce there is a moment ,
outside of time , outside of words ...
outside of everything .
a perfect moment . a silent moment .
i call it the world &apos;s whisper .
wow ... you &apos;re right .
and i don &apos;t mind admitting you &apos;re right ,
which is weird .
30 seconds on this thing , and i already feel--
jeff ...
you &apos;ve been up there for an hour .
okay , abed , girl in the pink--go .
her forehead hangs over ,
her head like a canopy .
she missed a belt loop ,
and her stomach spills over her shorts .
target destroyed .
what brutality .
it &apos;s called a muffin top , abed .
like a muffin ? clever .
but you guys said it &apos;s rude to focus on imperfections .
this the stuff i &apos;m supposed to filter , right ?
absolutely , abed .
it &apos;s just kind of a guilty pleasure
to hear it about ... certain girls .
like meghan and her friends , because they &apos;re bitches .
that &apos;s nice . uh , who needs a soda ?
i &apos;ll get it-- i &apos;m making you guys so happy ,
i want to keep it going .
okay , i love abed so much .
i know , it &apos;s like he &apos;s one of the girls .
uh , guys .
yeah , do you mind not looking at me ?
i don &apos;t know , do you mind that your face makeup
doesn &apos;t match your neck ?
when i squint , you look like a circus clown .
okay , i beg your pardon , geek ...
i don &apos;t even know your peanut @-@ headed ass .
you &apos;re right , we &apos;ve never met .
like your hair and dandruff shampoo .
hoo hoo ! filet of meghan , service for one .
okay , abed , let &apos;s get back to the table .
yeah , abed . go with your skank .
or keep going . up to you .
keep going about what , her uneven bra padding ?
you look like you &apos;re smuggling a lime and a coconut .
go away , loser .
good one--tell that to the stitching on your ratty panties ,
or wear higher jeans on laundry day .
damn , that diss made me snarf , yo !
you know what ? you &apos;re dead .
you &apos;re bowlegged .
bye . see ya .
women of greendale !
this cafeteria has been declared a bitch @-@ free zone !
can &apos;t tell you how great i feel right now .
i wasn &apos;t sure that you would take to the trampoline &apos;s ways .
some can &apos;t .
and some are just natural jumpers .
see you tomorrow , joshua .
we better bounce .
that &apos;s sharice .
i had sociology with her last year .
she told me i walk like a dude .
that &apos;s awful ! abed , you got anything ?
i might have something to say about those jeans she &apos;s wearing .
but you guys are sure it &apos;s not bad ?
bad isn &apos;t that bad when you &apos;re doing it to bad girls .
yeah , and you &apos;re really good at it .
you &apos;re like a machine .
like robocop .
exactly like rowboat cop .
sharice is a bad rowboat . sink her .
affirmative .
they &apos;re bad . - bad .
hey ... you dudes ready to shoot the rock
after study group ?
i &apos;m gonna slit your butt &apos;s throats .
nice catch , losers .
go get it .
sorry , pierce .
we &apos;re not really into basketball anymore .
what ?
what &apos;s up with you guys ?
why are you acting like that ?
like what ?
ah ! gay boots !
lady boots !
he &apos;s a gaywad .
are those as comfortable as they look ?
they &apos;re like wearing a pair of dreams .
i &apos;m sure your shoes are fine , though .
you know what ?
they are .
something &apos;s up with you two ,
and i want to know what it is .
are you on weed ?
give me some--i &apos;ll smoke you two under the table .
oh , man , i feel so good .
it &apos;s like the whole campus is a gutter
and we &apos;re just spraying it clean .
abed , i may need you to come to the bank with me
to have words with a certain something at window four .
we &apos;ll take &apos; em down .
we &apos;ll take all these bitches down .
ladies , are you okay ?
take it easy .
um , did you just tell us what to do ?
here &apos;s the thing .
it &apos;s a little rule .
maybe you &apos;re not familiar with it .
nobody tells me what to do--ever .
whoa , whoa , cowboy . i surrender .
abed , did you hear that ?
jeff a bitch too ?
yes .
take him down .
cool .
hey , jeff , what &apos;s with the boots ?
2008 called to tell you that , even in 2008,
those were tacky .
oh , you go , girl !
daaamn .
why don &apos;t we just all
take a deep breath and ... find some center .
okay , that is it !
what are you hiding from me ?
they &apos;re keeping relaxation secrets .
tell me how to get this laid back ,
or i &apos;ll kill your families !
okay , this place is lame .
girls , abed .
toodles .
i &apos;m watching you two .
24 , 2010 .
these balls on your butts .
quick bounce before lunch ?
absolutely .
let me just make sure that pierce isn &apos;t hovering around .
coast is clear .
what did you see , my pretty ?
wait .
back , back--freeze it .
can you blow that up a little ? enhance .
enhance .
enhance .
stop ! that &apos;s it .
blow it up .
there it is .
um , excuse me , girls .
you &apos;re sitting in our seats .
i &apos;m sorry . what did you say ?
oh ! i didn &apos;t know you were deaf .
i suspected you were blind from the outfit .
toodles .
see ya .
wait a minute .
why were you mean to them ? did they insult you ?
no , but that top insulted our retinas .
go , girl .
bad isn &apos;t that bad when you &apos;re doing it to bad girls .
annie , when you laugh like that , you snort like a piglet .
careful , abed .
be careful with your skin .
your face is so puffy right now ,
your eyes look like sewn @-@ on buttons .
you need to check that attitude at the door , abed .
you need to check the door
before you go through it , shirley .
what ? what ?
abed , you cannot talk to us that way .
someone has to . you guys are being bitches .
we &apos;re not bitches !
we were just joking .
if that makes us bitches , we &apos;re all bitches .
that &apos;s a good point , annie .
you told him .
affirmative . you &apos;re all bitches .
nice shirt . it would look better on a girl .
pick a bronzer .
you &apos;re not fooling us with that band @-@ aid--we knew it &apos;s a zit .
you &apos;re all bitches . triple bitches .
bitch , bitch , bitch .
hey , bitch . bitch . you bitch .
i &apos;m a bitch . you &apos;re a bitch .
pierce !
how did you find us ?
draganflyer , bee @-@ otch .
so this is the big secret , huh ?
you two sneak out here and hang out
on the big , gay trampoline .
lower your voice , pierce .
this is our place of peace .
yes . and now it &apos;s mine too .
mine .
oh , this is great !
i wanna go higher !
pierce ... please ...
you &apos;re doing it all wrong .
i wanna go higher !
troy , get up here and double bounce me .
that &apos;s not how we do things here .
you get up here and double bounce me ,
or i &apos;ll tell everybody about this place !
come on !
god is my witness , i will tweet it !
double bounce me !
why are you doing this ?
double bounce me ! do it !
pierce , that &apos;s enough .
i hate you .
i hate you !
double bounce me !
father ...
my legs ! ohh !
oh , my legs , i--
illegal trampoline !
they have an illegal trampoline back there !
whoa , black jeans ? nice try , michael penn .
those bangs aren &apos;t covering anything , five @-@ head .
pegged jeans . sweater balls . crows feet .
what &apos;s it called when your back hair
grows into your neck hair grows into your regular hair ?
look it up , because you have it .
nice . who taught you how to be a juice box ?
don &apos;t worry . i come in peace .
and whatever medicated shampoo you &apos;re using
seems to be doing the trick .
what do you want ?
to restore the natural order .
what are these ?
destruct codes .
well , that seems a little excessive .
joshua .
we were looking for you all over .
where you going ?
i got fired . i &apos;m leaving .
joshua , we are so sorry .
don &apos;t apologize .
it &apos;s my fault .
guess that &apos;s what i get for trusting some black guy .
what ?
when you found the trampoline ,
i thought the only way to protect it was to let you use it .
guess it goes to prove what i already knew :
non @-@ whites ruin everything .
oh , my god .
joshua was racist .
that came out of nowhere .
did it ?
a place free from darkness .
and some are just natural jumpers .
it &apos;s going to be a maze .
maybe i just didn &apos;t want to believe it .
maybe that &apos;s the lesson here .
purity that demands exclusion ...
isn &apos;t real purity .
maybe paradise is a lie .
not exactly .
paradise exists .
right here .
for once ... he &apos;s actually right .
let me buy you some ice cream .
my white guilt is doing somersaults .
worth it .
ahh , paradise .
hey ! horse @-@ neck .
so ... what &apos;s with the clothes ?
i mean , you look like a toddler who got dressed in the dark .
aww , snap !
here it comes , y &apos;all !
look at your face .
it &apos;s like your mom was a lizard who got raped by a muppet .
and that burn was brought to you by the letter &quot; s , &quot;
as in snap !
what ?
too hurt to respond ?
uhh ! that &apos;s right .
you don &apos;t have feelings .
see , the rest of us feel ashamed of ourselves ,
so we act like bitches to make ourselves feel better .
but you did it to fit in .
and no matter how hard you try ,
you never will .
snap . snap !
snap ! snap ! snap ! snap !
give it up ! ooh ! ooh ! snap ! snap !
abed , are you okay ?
that was so cruel .
i deserved it .
i should have never been mean to anybody ,
least of all you guys .
i was trying so hard to fit in that i took it too far .
we took it too far .
we became the kind of women that we hate ,
and we turned you into a monster .
the kind of monster that makes outlandish statements about someone &apos;s weight .
those kind of things hurt .
even when they &apos;re not true .
and all because we were insecure .
everyone is .
even tom cruise knows he &apos;s short and nuts .
we &apos;re at the mercy of each other and ourselves .
that &apos;s why there has to be forgiveness on both sides .
aww ... abed ...
oh , my goodness . what happened to pierce ?
long story .
men .
yeah .
damn it , pierce , will you knock it off ?
i told you , i &apos;m not controlling it .
there &apos;s a little man inside .
hi .
pierce !
listen , i wanted to let you know , pierce ,
it &apos;s okay to exceed the recommended daily dosage .
and don &apos;t let anybody tell you different !
who &apos;s going to be in charge of making sure he doesn &apos;t o.d. ?
what ? what--
when did we start doing that ?
three two one .
troy and abed in the mornin &apos; .
and we &apos;re back with greendale &apos;s resident animal expert , star @-@ burns .
my name &apos;s alex .
star @-@ burns joins us with his pet turtle , shelly .
now , i understand shelly can eat over five mice a day .
that &apos;s impressive .
turtles don &apos;t eat mice .
what do they eat ?
i don &apos;t know .
pellets ? i have no idea .
that &apos;s disappointing .
that &apos;s not good .
look , what is going on here ?
i was studying for my econ midterm .
you guys walk in , you hand me this turtle ,
and then you tell me to smile for the folks at home .
what folks at home ?
star @-@ burn ...
these things give you salmonella , you know .
let &apos;s go to gary with a check on the weather .
