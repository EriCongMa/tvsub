back in the &apos; 80s ,
you only had three options for birthday parties --
roller skating , chuck e . cheese ,
or seeing a wildly inappropriate movie
because your parents didn &apos;t know any better .
and then ...
everything changed !
we &apos;re playing laser tag tonight , people .
i know . it &apos;s gonna be awesome !
but you know what &apos;s gonna make it even more fun ?
protective cornea goggles .
no . no way . why the hell do i need to protect my corneas ?
because sue nagleman &apos;s son lost his eye to a laser beam .
it wasn &apos;t a laser . it was a taser .
and you don &apos;t talk back to cops .
it &apos;s safe , mom . laser tag &apos;s for little kids .
for your information , there are many adults
that enjoy playing laser tag .
i admit , they look kind of weird
waiting on that single @-@ player bench ,
with their desperate eyes just staring at you .
whatever ! it &apos;s fun for everyone !
but mostly dorky , little kids .
well , i &apos;ll never be a fan of lasers ,
but my scrumptious , little snuggle monster
gets whatever he wants on his birthday .
i want you to stop calling me &quot; snuggle monster . &quot;
can &apos;t give you that . but i can ... give you this .
it &apos;s present time !
what the heck is a sleeping angel book ?
i &apos;ve been taking pictures of you sleeping
once a month since you were born , my angel ,
and i made it into a book .
if you flip through it ,
you can see how much your head has grown .
why does it say &quot; sleeping angel part one &quot; ?
you &apos;ll find out when you go to college .
while my mom gave gifts ,
my dad had his own birthday tradition --
forgetting .
my foot hurts . what &apos;s for breakfast ?
well , we &apos;re celebrating you @-@ know @-@ who
with &quot; a &quot; -shaped pancakes .
&quot; a &quot; !
it almost slipped my mind .
al capone !
geraldo rivera is opening up al capone &apos;s vault today
live on television !
it &apos;s like my birthday .
okay , murray . stop playing around .
you know what day it is .
yeah , of course .
it &apos;s , um ...
baby !
baby out .
baby day .
baby ... birth .
baby rocking .
birth day .
birthday !
my son ...
who is way more important than al capone .
daddy and i also got you that , didn &apos;t we , mur ?
yeah . open it up . it &apos;s gonna blow your mind .
i &apos;m not much for surprises .
how about you tell me what you got me , mur ?
oh , no , no , no , no . it &apos;s a surprise .
tell me what you got me .
it &apos;s a surprise .
say it in words .
it &apos;s , uh , a @-@ a dancing lady .
a , uh , dancing ...
an angry , dancing karate @-@ monkey .
wow .
it was mid @-@ april , 1980 @-@ something .
i was still on an epic quest to get my first kiss
from my kinda / sorta / maybe girlfriend , dana caldwell .
thankfully , my favorite afroed tv painter , bob ross ,
was there to break the tension .
i like the way he paints trees .
the best .
you should see what he does with cottages .
... indication here and there
of some happy , little evergreen tress .
well , i should probably get going .
okay .
so , i &apos;ll see you at laser tag ?
yeah . i hope i &apos;m on your team .
i &apos;ll see what i can do , but no guarantees .
there &apos;s gonna be two captains . could get complicated .
so ...
happy birthday ?
up high ?
sure , it wasn &apos;t my first kiss ,
but this double wiggly high @-@ five was just as good ,
i tried to tell myself .
pathetic , dude .
oh , like you could do any better .
hell yeah , i could !
big tasty knows how to tame the booty with the beat .
you got to kiss her , bro !
i know !
just -- the timing hasn &apos;t been right .
i &apos;ve been busy , she &apos;s been busy .
her family went to sarasota .
i had that cold and that spanish quiz .
well , now the timing &apos;s right .
it &apos;s your birthday .
tonight , you got to throw a full @-@ on make @-@ out party .
a laser tag make @-@ out party ?
logistically , how would that even work ?
no laser tag ! just make @-@ out party !
what am i ? scott baio ?
i don &apos;t know how to throw a make @-@ out party .
that &apos;s why you call ...
barry &apos;s make @-@ out parties . how can i help you ?
can you tell my brother he &apos;s a giant putz ?
okay , we turn the basement into a love den .
how ? it &apos;s dark and dusty
and smells like your old , sweaty hockey gear .
pheromones , bro ! ladies love it .
and we &apos;ll light some incense ,
then we &apos;ll deck it out with sexy accessories
like moroccan pillows , lava lamps , and bongo drums .
i &apos;m intrigued . go on .
and we serve the sexiest foods .
go on .
oysters .
soft cheeses .
go on .
and onion dip .
nothing crunchy .
know why ?
crunchy isn &apos;t sexy .
wait .
how do you eat onion dip if you don &apos;t have anything --
spoons !
spoons are sexy .
you obviously know what you &apos;re talking about .
but how do i get dana to kiss me ?
easy . break the ice with games .
twister , truth or dare ,
and the main event --
seven minutes in heaven .
and you got to wear something seductive , so go to the mall ,
and buy the first velour clothing you see .
that &apos;s the sexiest of all fabrics .
velour . got it .
i was so desperate for my first kiss
that barry was actually making sense .
meanwhile , my dad was desperate
to watch some &quot; geraldo . &quot;
smells great in here !
yeah , i went to the south street italian market
in honor of the opening of al capone &apos;s vault .
truly , it &apos;s the most exciting thing to happen to me
in the past 20 years .
what about your kids ?
oh , they &apos;re not gonna be here .
adam &apos;s got a thing tonight .
a thing ?
it &apos;s his birthday party .
tell me at least you remembered it this year .
it &apos;s not whether or not i remembered .
it &apos;s whether he thinks i remembered .
i don &apos;t think you remembered .
there &apos;s the man i &apos;m looking for .
happy birthday , kiddo .
holy god .
a digital pac @-@ man watch ?
do you like it ?
uh , it &apos;s a video game on my wrist !
i love it !
thanks , pops .
you are the greatest man i &apos;ve ever known .
literally the greatest man .
what was that all about ?
did you not give him a gift ?
it &apos;s not whether i got him a gift ,
it &apos;s whether he thinks i got him a gift .
i don &apos;t !
murray , you do this every year .
for once , just get him something !
everybody knows that i &apos;m not good at birthdays
or giving gifts or remembering events .
it &apos;s my thing !
well , you &apos;re missing out .
i mean , did you see the look on adam &apos;s face
when i gave him that puckm &apos;n watch thing ?
pure joy !
that &apos;s why we should say the watch is from both of us .
just go get the kid a damn gift already !
while my dad had to suck it up and get me a gift ,
i was about to hurt my mom
worse than having all her leg hair yanked out by an epilady .
whoops ! ooh , i &apos;ll come back .
no , it &apos;s fine , boopie .
good .
&apos;cause i was thinking , instead of laser tag ,
maybe me and my friends could hang out in the basement
and watch &quot; ghostbusters . &quot;
what ? i &apos;m not canceling laser tag .
they wanted a $ 100 deposit
until i yelled at the guy to waive it .
i know it &apos;s last minute , but i really want this .
i guess i could make a &quot; ghostbusters &quot; cake .
yeah ... i &apos;m also thinking no cake .
no cake ?
no cake .
no cake ? !
no cake .
if there &apos;s no cake ,
then i can &apos;t hug you and sing &quot; happy birthday . &quot;
which works out well ,
&apos;cause i &apos;m also thinking no song and ... no you .
then i wouldn &apos;t be there .
i have to be there .
look , starting with this birthday ,
everything changes .
i &apos;m like an adult now .
but -- - this is my special day .
please , mama ?
i only pulled out the &quot; mama &quot;
when it was absolutely necessary ,
and when i did , she was putty in my hands .
okay , fine .
sad , boring ,
cakeless , songless , momless basement party it is .
with my mother successfully neutralized ,
my make @-@ out bash was a go .
i scored everything on barry &apos;s sexy checklist ,
right down to the velour shirt .
and that last smooth soul jam
was dedicated to all you lovers in the crowd .
you know who you are .
why is he nodding at us ?
no idea .
stop nodding at us !
turns out , make @-@ out parties are awesome in theory ,
but awkward in reality .
next up is twister , y &apos;all !
hope you stretched ,
cause it &apos;s about to get real bendy in here .
so , um , what happened to laser tag ?
i just thought this might be more fun .
oyster ?
soft cheese ?
oh , wow . that &apos;s really stinky .
you know it .
check this out .
moroccan pillow .
oh , it &apos;s hard .
sorry .
and with that , the best night of my life
had officially become a kissless , velour nightmare .
amazingly ,
my mom took my momless party in stride .
this is madness .
or not .
i mean , what boy wants a basement party ?
there &apos;s no pin the tail on the donkey ,
no balloons , no cake .
you know what ? screw it .
give me the phone book . i &apos;m calling a clown .
no ! stop !
no clown .
i know my son .
he needs me down there .
i can literally feel him call me
to bring him this festive platter of bagel bites .
you promised adam .
i &apos;ll bring him the stupid bagel bites .
gimme .
you stay put .
the last thing erica wanted
was for my overbearing smother to ruin my party .
but then she saw the soft , pink mood lighting ...
... and the gooey , sexy foods ?
and chachi !
and just like that , my sister went into full mom mode .
what the hell is happening here ?
looks like a love dungeon in a serial killer &apos;s house .
it &apos;s a make @-@ out party ,
and i got to say , bagel bites ?
not sexy . get &apos; em out of here .
&apos;sup , erica ? didn &apos;t know you &apos;d be here .
okay , get your body away from me , dave kim .
seriously ?
this whole thing is upsetting and wrong .
and it has to stop right now .
okay , this is all i could find for spin the bottle ,
but it &apos;s completely full .
barry to the rescue .
i &apos;ll take it down . my body loves calcium .
that day , my brother found out the hard way
it &apos;s physically impossible to drink that much milk .
is this from a cow ?
why is it so hard ?
my body says no , but ...
i &apos;m gonna do this for you guys .
are you kidding me ?
spin the bottle , mood lighting , and velour ?
this isn &apos;t you .
can we talk about this later ?
you &apos;re kind of giving off a ... mom vibe .
i am not mom !
i will never be mom !
now , take these bagel bites
and blow on them three times
or they &apos;ll scald your little mouth ,
and get away from me , dave kim !
okay . i &apos;m gonna need you to leave my party .
oh , i &apos;m leaving .
i &apos;ll go up there and tell mom
all about your creepy freak fest .
hold on .
you win , okay ?
at least let me tell her .
and it &apos;s just i thought i knew what kind of party i wanted .
but i realize now --
what is it , honey ?
i really want a cake !
something that reminds me of my childhood .
it would make me so happy , but now it &apos;s too late ...
mama .
mama &apos;s here , baby .
mama &apos;s going to the store right now .
mama will be back in 20 minutes .
wait . mom !
out of my way !
i @-@ i want bert and ernie !
anything for my birthday boy .
well , that was good .
but you leave me no choice .
when mom gets back , i &apos;m gonna tell her everything .
oh , i don &apos;t think so .
unless you want her to hear
what happened at the winter formal .
what ?
and when you were on that ski trip .
what ? - three words -- south padre island .
what ?
i have been the coolest little brother in the world
until now .
you keep my secret , i &apos;ll keep yours .
now , do we understand each other ?
yes !
good .
while my sister was trying
to figure out a way to end my party ,
barry was doing all he could to keep it chugging along .
are you almost done ?
people are starting to lose interest in spin the bottle .
i &apos;m trying !
son of a bitch ! this thing is bottomless !
that bottle wasn &apos;t the only thing bottomless .
just then , my dad decided to pick
the worst moment to finally give me my birthday gift .
where &apos;s the man of the hour ? !
dad , what the hell ? you &apos;re not wearing any pants !
oh , they know how it works around here .
you notice anything else ?
laser tag !
i bought a bunch for you and your friends .
yeah . great . now please leave .
i just went and bought you
the thing you wanted most in the world .
you could at least give me
a thumbs @-@ up , a thank @-@ you , a look of appreciation .
happy ?
that &apos;s a fake smile , and you know it .
it &apos;s not a fake smile . it &apos;s got teeth and everything .
i hate that smile !
i don &apos;t even like laser tag , okay ?
want to get me a present ?
go .
my dad finally bought me a gift from the heart ,
and i flat @-@ out rejected him .
i was sacrificing everything for that kiss ,
and nothing would stop me .
it burns !
can i get some milk ?
seriously ? !
now you ask me ?
you &apos;re unb--
i got to go . i got to go .
i had neutralized erica with threats
and my mother with cake ,
but i knew that wasn &apos;t gonna hold them off forever .
is the cake ready yet ?
i mean , how much more baking do you need to do already ?
get off my back , erica .
i &apos;m a mother , not a pastry chef .
this looks like &quot; sloth &quot; from &quot; the goonies . &quot;
why is it so hard to make an oblong bert head ?
no , no , no , no ! don &apos;t start over !
just go downstairs right now
and see what &apos;s going on , okay ?
no , i can &apos;t barge in .
what do you mean you can &apos;t barge in ?
that &apos;s all you do !
i finally made some headway with adam .
he asked for a cake .
if i play my cards right ,
i can get some huggies when we sing &quot; happy birthday &quot; !
mom , do you remember the time
that you snuck in the basement and spied on me and lainey
drinking mango madness wine coolers
and then grounded me for two months ?
yes . that was a good day .
okay , well , i need you to go downstairs .
and just in case adam does mention something
about south padre island , he &apos;s a liar .
and i &apos;m sorry .
while my meddling smother plotted her next move ,
the plot thickened outside al capone &apos;s vault .
... the real secret tunnel .
i can &apos;t believe it .
that little moron ruined al capone &apos;s vault for me .
stop it , murray .
in 10 minutes ,
he &apos;s gonna blow open that vault
and with it , our minds .
how am i supposed to enjoy it ?
i don &apos;t buy adam a gift , he &apos;s pissed at me .
i buy him a gift , he &apos;s even more pissed at me .
i can &apos;t win .
our baby grew up so fast , didn &apos;t he ?
it &apos;s , like , one minute , he &apos;s this little , four @-@ eyed dork .
then you blink , and he &apos;s a man .
a man with needs .
what &apos;s happening ?
i miss that little lovebug . that &apos;s what &apos;s happening .
oh , my god . i am mom !
you are , and i got to tell you , it &apos;s a real downer .
you know how many gifts my dad bought me growing up ?
zero .
that &apos;s all i got from that man -- nothing .
do you think it hurt ? damn right , it hurt .
oh , my god !
why are you coming to terms with this now ?
they &apos;re about to blow the safe !
see , that &apos;s why i don &apos;t give gifts .
it &apos;s all a sham .
i wish we could just stop time , you know ?
and keep him our special , little boy forever .
okay . that &apos;s it .
i &apos;m watching tv upstairs .
no one follow me .
while my dad and sister were having a breakdown ,
my mom was plotting a break @-@ in .
my god , she was like a silent ,
manicured , nosy ninja .
smooth move , adam .
it &apos;s not my fault . it &apos;s too big a bottle .
it &apos;s meant for milk , not spinning .
maybe we should just go .
no !
don &apos;t go .
how about , uh , seven minutes in heaven ?
yeah . yeah .
it &apos;s your birthday , dude , so you pick first .
this kiss was my al capone &apos;s vault .
the buildup was excruciating ,
and it was finally time to get it over with .
dana , i guess ?
um ... okay .
even though my big moment was here ,
i was blissfully unaware
that the other woman in my life had crashed my party .
are you playing pac @-@ man ?
no , i @-@ i &apos;m trying to set the timer .
the directions are in japanese .
it &apos;s very complicated .
there we go .
we &apos;re on the clock .
are you sweating ?
it &apos;s the velour shirt . it doesn &apos;t breathe .
it reminds me of my nana &apos;s robe .
so ...
we got 6 : 38 left .
what are you thinking ?
i guess we could , um , you know .
okay .
let &apos;s ... you know .
what &apos;s wrong ?
me ? i thought that was you .
hi , poopie .
oh , my god .
hey , dana .
oh , my god !
wow . that is an adorable dress .
i was just seeing if the ski boots
were all where they &apos;re supposed to be ,
and , uh they are .
dana !
i don &apos;t want to talk to you .
wait . just give me a sec .
your mom was in our seven minutes in heaven !
i &apos;m sorry . this whole thing has been a complete disaster .
why &apos;d you even throw this stupid party ?
what was wrong with laser tag ?
nothing ! i love laser tag .
then why didn &apos;t we just play laser tag ?
you big idiot .
you &apos;re right . i am an idiot .
let &apos;s just play laser tag .
that night , my worst birthday ever became the best .
yeah , we all wanted that first kiss ,
but for one more night ,
we were all happy to keep on being kids .
what a little dork .
thank god .
dad !
best gift ever !
see that smile ?
that &apos;s it ! that &apos;s the look !
come on . let &apos;s go see that handsome devil open that vault .
oh , just tell me what happens .
it seems , at least up to now ,
that we &apos;ve struck out with the vault .
i &apos;m disappointed about that , as i &apos;m sure you are .
turns out , al capone &apos;s vault was empty .
all that buildup and no payoff .
poor mustachioed bastard .
we &apos;re just taking a break .
i just finished the cake .
it &apos;s terrible , isn &apos;t it ? i should just start over .
no ! i love it .
let &apos;s eat .
happy birthday , snuggle monster .
thanks , mama .
there &apos;s too many of them .
you run , i &apos;ll cover you .
gotcha !
no !
you saved me .
i ... guess i did .
even though al capone &apos;s vault
may have been a complete letdown ,
some things in life
are as amazing as you &apos;d hoped they &apos;d be .
who should i kiss ?
come on , adam !
she &apos;s not gonna let me kiss --
okay .
as student council treasurer ,
we should go over the budget first ,
and then , if we have time , talk bake sale .
why exactly are we meeting down here ?
no reason .
soft cheese ? oyster ?
not you , sanjeev .
let &apos;s begin , shall we ?
unfortunately , there &apos;s no chairs ,
so we &apos;re gonna have to sit in a circle on the floor .
oh ! look !
a bottle !
here &apos;s a crazy idea .
spin the bottle !
i &apos;ll go first .
bagel bites ?
