Oh, my god. You scared me.
I almost got it.
We have to protect our future by protecting our children.
Get garbage food out of the lunchroom now.
You tell them, Tom!
I'm sorry. Was that too loud?
I like your enthusiasm.
I really like Tom MacGregor Jr. --
good Scottish lad from an old Boston family,
politics in his blood.
Holy crap, ma.
I can't even see the table.
Glitter, ma?
It's festive.
It's hard to clean up.
What's going on here?
"Maximum depth -- 180 feet"?
What are you, James Cameron?
Maura.
At least he's certified.
I haven't had time to take the course.
So you'll do that
before or after your "Outback lady walk"?
Are you also in the remake of "Out of Africa"?
Give me that.
Special delivery.
Oh, yeah, just walk right in.
Okay, thanks.
Wow, you look hot.
Nice hat. You look hot, too, Jane.
You two ever decide to bat for the other team --
Not on your team.
What is that? Is that a surfboard?
What is he doing here?
He's helping me.
Helping you what? Your car's outside.
Sweet, huh?
"You want this dud."
"This dude," Jane. D-u-d.
Yo, Mrs. Rizz, you look hot.
Stop it, Giovanni, or I'll tell your mother.
No, don't tell my mom.
That's what all this is about,
you buying all this stuff --
it's about Hope, isn't it?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Oh, yes, you do.
Whenever you get in a crisis,
you get on a first-name basis with the U.P.S. man.
Maura, it's time to find her.
No. Only 65% of adopted children
seek out their biological parents.
I'm in the other 35%.
35% having an identity crisis.
Rizzoli.
Yeah.
Okay. We'll be right there.
Come on. We got a case.
Hey, you can take your vest,
'cause the murder is near Franklin Park.
You got a murder in the Franklin Park zoo?
Why? You got family there?
Jane!
You're so funny.
She's so funny.
And hot.
What's there to talk about?
My birth mother was an unwed college student
who was sneaking around with a southie gangster.
So?
That's at least interesting.
My birth mother married the neighborhood plumber.
The only sneaking around she did was in Filene's Basement.
Paddy Doyle, my father --
In sperm only.
Yeah, who is waiting to be tried for 15 murders,
told hope that I died at birth.
Help me understand how that could make for a successful reunion.
Don't you want to know anything about her?
No!
You...
You found her, didn't you?
You did.
You're gonna get the worst case of hives in your life
if you lie.
I had her first name, her age,
where she went to college, my birth date --
I couldn't help it.
Okay, so now what?
I don't know what, okay?
Good morning. What do we have?
White woman, beaten.
Looks like somebody took a blow torch to her hands.
What, trying to conceal her I.D.?
Don't think so.
Found her driver's license in her back pocket.
I think dr. Isles is going in.
She loves dumpster diving.
Celia Jaffe, 27.
Early-bird dumpster diver found her.
So glad I brought my tyvek suit.
Oh, shoot. I forgot mine.
Darn. Me too.
Lividity indicates she died sometime after midnight
and was dumped here shortly thereafter.
It's a good thing we got an I.D.
We're not getting any prints off of these.
I'll find out if she has a husband or a boyfriend.
Let's get her photographed, get her out of here.
What are you doing?
Checking the weather.
What? I said, "Checking the weather."
Okay, okay. Sheesh.
Why aren't you examining the body?
I knew it.
The weather? Really?
It's a daily weather forecast...
on her wikipedia page.
Whose page?
Oh, my g--
Maura, she looks just like you!
You mean I look like her.
Her name is Hope -- Dr. Hope Martin.
Wow. She's kind of famous.
"Dr. Martin founded
an international relief agency: M.E.N.D."
Medical Emergency Network for Doctors.
Their mission is to treat women and children
who are suffering.
Keep scrolling.
See the forensic pathology residency she did in Sarajevo?
Yeah.
She's done everything.
So she identifies victims of genocide
and saves women and children around the world -- big deal.
You are just as accomplished, Maura.
No, I'm not.
Paddy said she was brilliant.
And recently divorced.
She has a daughter -- Cailin, 18.
She's been living abroad for the past 20 years.
Okay, Celia Jaffe needs an autopsy.
And I need a cause of death, maura.
Hope even developed a technique
to identify the victims of genocide
We're still using today.
Well, it's too bad she's not local.
We could use her right about now.
She's probably very curious about you, too.
Why would she be curious?
She doesn't even know I exist.
Or maybe she does.
How can she not?
She hasn't made any effort to contact me.
Okay, Maura, maybe she saw that
and thinks Paddy was cheating on her
and had a kid named Maura.
Or maybe she only reads fancy French newspapers.
Or maybe she hasn't thought of Paddy Doyle
in the past 36 years.
Or me.
Wait a minute.
No, don't.
Oh my g-- she's moved back to Boston?
Come on. Maura, I don't believe in coincidences.
This is meant to be.
I'd be turning her world upside down for what?
So she can have you in her life, okay?
Late is a million times better than never.
Not if it causes her pain.
Look at the pain you're in.
I got a suspect upstairs.
Come on. Do the autopsy, okay?
It'll make you feel better.
Come on. Come on. Come on. March.
He won't come upstairs.
Says we can talk to him right here.
All right, let me try.
He's all yours.
Mr. Jaffe, thank you for coming.
Look, if this is about that parking ticket,
what a waste of my tax dollars.
It's about your wife.
What about Celia?
We believe she was murdered.
Where were you last night?
Where the hell do you think I was?
Celia! Get over here!
Faster!
Shut up. You're gonna wake up the baby.
Oh, now you decide to sleep.
You see that? That's my wife.
A woman was using your I.D.,
and we found her body.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my wallet was stolen last week.
Your wallet was stolen?
Shh! You will wake the baby.
Any idea where?
No. I don't know.
It could've been at the mall
or when I was going to get coffee.
Going to the mall and getting lattes
while I'm bustin' my ass to support you?
Shh! You'll wake the baby.
But you didn't report it?
You're driving around with no license?
With our insurance rates?
Shut up, or I will arrest you for baby wake-age.
I haven't had time to go get a new one.
Besides, whoever stole it --
They sent it back to me in the mail.
See?
And -- and everything was in it,
except for my driver's license.
That's a good move, Celia.
Yeah? Nice work, Rick.
Come here. It's okay. It's okay.
Oh, my god. I am never having kids.
So, uh, sounds like our victim
was pretending to be somebody else.
And hiding from someone who apparently found her.
So, our victim steals a wallet,
returns everything but the I.D.,
assumes a new name,
and ends up dead in a dumpster.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
What's the matter?
That's Sister Winifred Callahan.
One there.
She's the meanest person I've ever met in my entire life.
I see you hiding out there,
Jane Clementine Rizzoli.
Your middle name is Clementine?
Hello, Sister Winifred.
I never would've thought
the girl who broke a cafeteria window with her foot
would be on this side of the law.
I was 7.
I was trying to kill a fly.
Remind me what I gave you for comportment?
Um, C-minus.
What's comportment?
Behavior.
So, um... What brings you here?
"Um"? I have counted two ums in 10 seconds,
Miss Rizzoli.
It's...
Detective Rizzoli.
I guess you don't read the newsletter.
Big surprise.
I am here to do the lord's work.
Wow. Awarded a federal grant
to counsel families of homicide victims.
No kidding. Here?
I really would've preferred Cambridge,
but Sister Helen Marie got that grant.
Well, I can't wait to catch up,
but I have to go to the morgue.
I'll be holding my breath for your return.
Okay.
They had to bring in Sister bitcher.
"The lord's work."
Yeah, that's what she said
when she hit me with a ruler because
I misspelled "flamboyant."
Why was the word "flamboyant"
on a second-grade spelling test at a Catholic School?
I don't know.
And no one's reported her missing. Why not?
Well, she has a depressed skull fracture.
Must've been a hefty weapon.
Not a weapon.
So she just woke up this morning, and after she brushed her teeth,
she thought, "Gee, my head hurts."
No. She has contrecoup contusion from a massive fall.
"Contrecoup" means --
Yeah, it's not my first rodeo.
It means her head bounced around inside her skull.
After striking a hard object.
So not a pillow.
It takes longer when you make jokes.
I would poke out my eyes out with a scalpel
if I didn't make jokes.
Sister Winnie is scary.
Oh, don't call her "Winnie."
I got two weeks in detention for that.
Could also be because
I was singing, "Winnie the Poop."
Oh! Oh, I might have something.
Her fourth digit isn't
as badly burned as the others.
Might be able to try a rehydration technique.
You can get a print off of that?
It looks like a charred tootsie roll.
I've never done it.
I've only read about it in...
an article published by a Dr. Hope Martin.
Well, perhaps we should call Dr. Hope Martin.
No!
I -- I'll just try myself.
Well, doc, you're not gonna --
You are.
You have to detach the finger
in order to rehydrate the tissue.
Frost?
Tying my shoe.
Your shoes don't have laces.
Oh, my gosh.
Detective Frost?
I think he passed out.
A student gave me this.
I think nuns are awesome.
It's words like "Awesome"
that have ruined a glorious language.
Your coffee is bitter.
I'm sorry. Shall I make a fresh pot?
Don't bother.
It would probably be bitter, too.
Would you like some cream and sugar?
Nope. Hate to get used to anything
in case there's a shortage.
What am I gonna do with my files?
I need a great, big cabinet.
These police files?
The families of the victims you'll be counseling?
These are my internal files for the hell-raisers.
Jane was a hell-raiser?
Jane Rizzoli didn't like to be told what to do.
Well, that's still true.
You think that's funny?
So, that's all we know so far?
Hello, Francesco.
Uh, hi, sister.
Fran-- your real name is Francesco?
Yeah. You got a problem with that?
I prefer to call people by their given names.
Their parents went to a lot of trouble.
What is your full name, young man?
Speak up.
It's Barold.
Barold!
"Barold" means "Spear."
It's a very substantial name.
Wear it proudly, Barold.
Uh, listen, sister, we've got a young woman,
a Jane Doe down in the morgue.
We really have to get back to work.
Am I keeping you?
Okay.
Shouldn't a crime-lab tech be doing this?
No. Stop criticizing.
I tried potassium chloride,
but it was too destructive to the friction ridge skin.
You only got one finger.
What is that supposed to mean?
It means you can't screw it up.
So maybe you call Hope to do this.
I also only have only one biological mother,
And I'd rather not screw that up.
Damn!
The Ruffer Rehydration Method
modified by Walker isn't working.
You don't know how to do it.
Yes, I do.
No, you don't.
Look, you said you wanted to know her, okay?
Meet her on a level playing field.
Meet her as a colleague.
Maura, I got to find out who this woman is.
Who are you calling?
Dr. Pike. He'll help.
No. No.
Don't you dare call that knucklehead.
Maura, just face whatever it is that's terrifying you.
Face her.
This is the easiest way.
Okay.
Okay?
Okay.
Okay. I'm going to do it.
I am going to call her now.
Like now now?
Yes. Before I lose my nerve.
Okay, don't you want to...
No, no. No. I am perfectly calm.
I'm Dr. Maura Isles,
the chief medical examiner of the commonwealth --
Dr. Martin.
Hello? Is someone there?
Hello?
No. You have to do it.
Is someone there? Hello?
Hi.
I am calling from the office of Dr. Maura Isles,
the chief medical examiner
for the commonwealth of Massachusetts.
Could you hold for her, please?
I can't. I can't.
Hello?
Please.
I'm sorry.
I hate cellphones, don't you?
Um, so, we -- we are working on
a very difficult homicide together.
We're trying to identify a Jane Doe.
Would you be willing to do a consult?
Yes, half an hour would be fine.
Thank you so much.
A half an hour?
Are you out of your mind?
You can do it.
Yes, you can.
No.
You can do this.
Is it too late to call in sick?
I don't think I can do this.
I can't.
What? No. Oh, my g--
Ma, Cavanaugh is gonna kill you.
BPD hates Tom MacGregor.
He's soft on crime.
Well, he's hard on school-lunch reform.
Put some pepper, pepper, pepper
on your poli, poli, politics.
Never do that again.
You're funny and hot.
Hey, you ever decide you want to...
You're first on the list.
Honey, don't you want to at least meet her?
Well, obviously, I'm curious.
But I don't need a mother.
I have a mother.
What can I get you?
Have a coffee.
Do you have any more of those green-label organic beans?
Of course.
Make it extra hot
and 1% milk, not 2%.
And flat with just a hint of foam.
And a spoon, please.
No coffee stirrer?
There's an aftertaste.
Most coffee stir sticks are made from 100% birch wood.
There's no chemicals or toxins or glazes.
But the birch plant is known to be bitter,
thus the slightly unpleasant aftertaste.
You must be Dr. Martin.
Hi. I'm detective Jane Rizzoli.
And I'm Angela. I'm Jane's mom.
And this is Dr. Maura Isles.
What a pleasure.
I am flattered that you would want a consult.
I've tried so many formulas --
tetrodotoxin glucose, methylene --
Dr. Isles, are you all right?
Why -- because I'm talking too much
and talking too fast and not making any sense?
You're showing signs of urticaria.
Oh, you have hives.
Oh, no! Oh, my gosh.
Maura.
That must be because you ate, um, the brazil nuts.
Yes.
Dr. Isles, how many times do we have to tell you
to avoid brazil nuts?
Could I get you a latte
made out out of the green-label beans?
No, thank you.
I would very much like to see your victim.
And I have a lot of work to do upstairs, so I'm gonna go.
Maura.
Do you have your epipen?
And I came up with this rehydration technique
because we were so desperate to identify the bodies.
After the genocide in Sarajevo.
Yes.
And then we had to use it again
to identify entire Kurdish families
that were slaughtered by Saddam Hussein.
So, what made you go from your medical internship
to Sarajevo?
Maybe I was punishing myself.
Maybe I didn't believe that I could save people,
but I knew that I could speak for the dead.
Well, I wish I could speak for her.
She's someone's daughter.
That's what drives me.
Everyone is someone's child.
You said you were punishing yourself.
For what?
Something stupid that I did when I was 18.
I hope my daughter has better judgment
than I did then.
What did you do?
I got pregnant.
And the baby died at birth.
It was terrible and traumatic.
But maybe there was a reason that she didn't survive.
See, her father was...
evil.
I-I'm sorry.
I didn't -- I didn't mean to pry.
I never talk about this.
I spent so many years trying to forget.
Maybe it's because you're a doctor.
I feel a strange kinship with you.
Me too.
For you.
For helping me change the future.
Giovanni, you shouldn't have.
What were you thinking?!
That you're hot.
And may-december romances are all the rage, Mrs. Rizz.
I mean, you are such a cougar. Meow!
You come one step closer,
and I'll be bringing your mother
your body parts in a pie tin!
I'm sorry, Mrs. Rizz.
I'm sorry.
I'm just kind of lonely.
I mean...
I mean, I think I'm a catch.
Why can't I find a girl
who understands all I got to offer?
Do you come on this strong to other girls?
Well, stronger, usually.
I mean, I was going easy on you
'cause you're, you know, old.
Can I just get a mom hug?
Come on.
Just one mom hug.
Come on, Mrs. Rizz. Come here.
I friggin' love you, Mrs. Rizz.
Okay. Yeah.
Please tell me you're seeing whorls and ridges.
We are.
And there is excellent ridge detail.
Okay, let me see if it scans.
That's a good print.
Well done, doctors.
Oh, my.
She gets very emotional
when we break a case wide open.
Yes, I do.
How lovely.
Thank you.
Well, I'm, uh, I'm sorry,
but I have to go pick up my daughter.
Thank you so much, Dr. Martin.
You are very welcome.
Dr. Isles,
I would very much like to have lunch sometime.
Of course.
You have my information.
Let's make this sooner rather than later.
I really -- really enjoyed it.
Maura...
That was so beautiful!
When are you gonna tell her?
Never.
Never, ever. Never, ever. Never, ever.
All right, gentlemen, turn left.
Last desk on the right.
Come on, Francesco. Move it along.
What the hell is she doing?
Making herself at home here in hell.
Got it.
Emma Spencer, 27.
Holy crap.
She's a legal intern.
She works at the district attorney's office.
Her prints are there
because she registered to take this year's bar exam.
Got her DMV photo.
She looks just like Celia Jaffe.
What the hell is she doing stealing a new mother's wallet?
How did somebody like that end up in a dumpster
and nobody reports her missing?
Maybe one of the creeps the D.A.'s office prosecuted?
She'd only been there three months.
I'm quitting. I can't take it.
I almost ran away in second grade
when I got stuck with that -- that --
Sweet, kind, loving nun.
I am so out of here.
Aw. You gonna grab your thomas the train backpack
and run away, Francesco?
Can I take him?
Take me where, Barold?
To the D.A.'s Office.
We're gonna talk to our victim's boss.
Oh, anything to stop moving her furniture.
Hey, Frankie, remember Frost is the detective.
Barold?
Emma's goal was to be assigned to the sexual-assault team.
Damn. This is just plain tragic.
Sexual assault --
That's a tough job.
Yeah, but she was cut out for it.
She was very smart and tough.
When was the last time that you saw her?
Last week.
She asked for a week off.
To study for the bar?
No, actually, she said she had a family emergency.
This her boyfriend?
That's her brother.
I just assumed that something happened to him.
They're very close.
They shared an apartment.
She didn't have any other family or a boyfriend,
As far as I know.
Was she being stalked?
Maybe somebody threatening her?
No, I can't imagine that.
I think she would have told me.
She was always professional and upbeat--
Until the day that she asked for some time off.
She seemed so down.
I just wish I knew why.
Oh, excuse me.
I'm gonna have to take this.
I have a trial going on.
Devere.
So, you, want to go hang with sister Winifred
and say the rosary, Francesco,
Or come with me to interview the brother?
You ever ask your mom why she named you "Barold," Barold?
Okay, let's just stop.
She said she was studying for the bar.
She took off last week.
Do you know where she went?
No.
She just said she needed to hunker down and study.
She took her computer and one bag.
We'd like to look through your apartment.
Yeah, you can...you can look through anything.
When was the last time you heard from your sister?
Every day.
She...she sent me an e-mail.
Said she was tired, but...but...but good.
You can...you can look through my account, too.
She was my only family.
I'm really sorry for your loss.
Sit up straight.
Didn't find Emma's computer...
Or anything else...in her apartment.
That's too bad.
I'm gonna go through the server at the D.A.'s office
and track Emma's correspondence.
Would you like a cough drop, sister?
It sounds like you have some phlegm in your throat.
I was thinking you might want to thank the Lord
for that sandwich.
Thank you
for my peanut-butter-and-fluff sandwich.
Although I wish it had more peanut butter and less fluff.
Emma was sending e-mail from the building where she worked,
But she wasn't sending it from her office.
Where was she sending it from?
The I.P. Address is from an unassigned office
in the courthouse basement.
What did we stumble on?
Looks like the lair of a serial killer.
Frost, Emma was investigating a cold case...
A 17-year-old who disappeared 10 years ago.
Her remains were found last week.
"The body of Isabelle Dubois, 17,
was discovered when a family was cleaning out a vacant home."
Listen to this from 10 years ago.
"Emma Spencer, also 17,
told police Isabelle, her best friend,
failed to show up for a planned sleep over."
Best friends...Emma and Isabelle.
Man, they did everything together.
Emma must have used her new job at the D.A.'s office
To get this copy of Isabelle's autopsy report.
She's even got the photos.
Yuck.
This is a note from Isabelle to Emma.
It was written the day she disappeared.
"He says he'll be my 'knight in shining armor.'
Gag me with a spoon.
But I'm going tonight. I'll be fine.
Love, Izzie."
She wasn't fine.
It's the oldest teenage-girl trick in the book.
Emma covers for Isabelle,
says they're having a sleep over.
Cost Isabelle her life.
I think this is a lair of guilt.
You know, I'm gonna have Maura look at Isabelle's remains.
That body is 10 years old.
Maybe Emma found something
the Worcester M.E.'s office missed.
She was asphyxiated
and has quite a bit of adipocere tissue.
I hate soap mummies.
Okay, it says here
there's an abnormality to Isabelle's left cheekbone.
It's an injury, not an abnormality.
That's why Pike is still in Worcester.
You see the tool marks on her zygomatic bone?
On her cheekbone?
Yeah, those three round indentations
with scalloped edges. What is that from?
It's a very strange pattern.
Isabelle was struck with something hard enough
to break the skin and pierce the bone.
Well, Korsak's looking at
what's left of Isabelle's clothing.
You said the body was found in an old lady's basement.
Did the old lady kill her?
It's doubtful.
Doubtful?
So she might have?
No.
Then why did you say "Doubtful"?
I just wanted you to know what uncertainty felt like.
Oh, my g...
Maura, I didn't mean it...
Oh. I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.
Everything makes me cry.
Adipocere tissue never makes me cry.
My mother said it was better that I didn't live.
Okay, now you're being ridiculous.
She did not say that.
She said it was traumatic, right?
Which means that it makes her sad.
She doesn't want to dwell on it.
I just don't ever want her to know
that I'm that evil child.
Here. Blow.
Everything okay?
Allergies. She ate brazil nuts.
Oh. We're doing good in there.
Look at this.
Found this metal ring in her blouse.
See this piece of her jeans?
Yeah, you think that's semen?
Tested positive.
I'm running it right now.
Oh, my god.
I was just picking up
my residential parking permit upstairs.
I hope it's okay.
Yes, yes. It's fine.
Uh, we were just breaking another case.
Terrific. I stopped in because I --
Well, I wanted to know if you were able to identify her.
We were.
Soap mummy?
Looks to be about 10 years old.
Yes.
You're amazing.
Got something big, Jane.
I tracked all of Emma's e-mail.
She took a leave of absence to try to get another job.
What? Where?
You're not gonna believe this.
She was applying to the No Cares Au Pair Agency.
To do what?
To be a nanny.
You recognize this woman?
I know all my employees.
That's Celia Jaffe.
Actually, that's Emma Spencer.
Celia Jaffe was her alias.
That's not possible.
We always run a thorough,
multi-step background check on everyone.
Did you do the thorough,
multi-step background check on this employee?
Well, we checked her driving record.
So that's a no.
She came in to interview in the middle of a crisis.
A-a very prominent client had just fired their nanny
and needed an immediate replacement.
Emma was the perfect replacement?
She had very hard-to-find skills.
She was willing to live in,
spoke fluent French, well-educated.
Who was the client?
I can't divulge that.
Well, that's too bad...
Since it might be your last
when word gets out that you don't vet your nannies.
It was Tom Macgregor and his wife.
Tom Macgregor JR., the one who's running for congress?
You understand the need for discretion.
Oh, we do.
It seems awfully coincidental
that the Macgregors had to fire their nanny
the same day that Emma Spencer came in for an interview.
The Macgregors received an anonymous phone call
saying that their nanny,
who is 60 and someone I certainly did vet,
was selling crack cocaine.
I guess you never know.
Guess you never do.
Move that over.
That anonymous phone call
reporting Mary Poppins, the crack dealer --
It came from Emma spencer.
Yeah, of course it did.
How else was Emma gonna get into the Macgregor fortress?
She was looking for something.
Yeah, something to connect
Macgregor to Isabelle's murder.
I'll grab Korsak,
do an initial interview with Macgregor
before he lawyers up.
See what he says when I show him Isabelle and Emma's photos.
Okay, I'll push the crime lab on the DNA processing.
Thank you for keeping the streets safe from crime, Barold.
Um, we have a cleaning staff, you know.
Apparently, you have forgotten
the "Tidy desk, tidy minds" Song.
*Tidy 'round your desk and chair*
*Tidy, tidy everywhere*
*Tidy farts and wide-ee butts, I can see your underwear*
So, she likes Montepulciano,
Lebanese zucchini, and science fiction.
She's a soap mummy.
No. Uh, Hope.
My, uh...
My new friend.
Aw, that's wonderful, Maura.
And she said she'd call me
once she's settled into her new home.
Ooh, I was hoping those are the DNA results.
Not yet.
It's Isabelle's tox screen.
There were traces of rohypnol in her system.
Roofies. The date-rape drug.
Maybe Isabelle was raped,
and that's why she was murdered.
Would you ever wear a skirt, Frost?
Where is this going?
Hello, gentlemen.
Great to have you here.
Is the Detectives Union endorsing me?
Uh, not exactly.
Do you know this woman?
Yeah, of course. That's Celia.
We hired her to take care of our 6-year-old.
She must not have liked it here very much.
She left after -- was it two days?
Yes. Monday to Wednesday.
By Thursday morning, she'd packed up and disappeared.
What's this about?
Mr. Macgregor has another speaking engagement in 30 minutes.
We're investigating her murder.
God.
If I may -- this is a terrible tragedy,
but Mr. Macgregor hardly knew Ms. Jaffe.
I'm more concerned about my daughter.
Celia wasn't here very long, but Gracie really liked her.
Her name wasn't Celia.
It was Emma Spencer.
She was a recent law-school graduate
who was working in the D.A.'s office.
What was she doing working as our nanny?
We don't know.
Oh, I think I do.
Another dirty campaign maneuver,
courtesy of your opponent.
Do you know this woman?
No.
Who is she?
This is from primitive steel.
It has a good deal of slag in it.
Remind me why I care about slag
and get to the hunch part.
Well, the last time this type of steel was manufactured
was in the 15th century.
That's a gauntlet
from a post-medieval Scottish knight's suit of armor.
Let me see this petri dish.
You think that this ring could be from chain mail
from a suit of armor?
I think it might be from a gauntlet.
Isabelle's cheek --
You're saying the murderer was wearing the gauntlet
when he hit her?
These are the DNA results.
Which Boston family would have
a Sottish post-medieval suit of armor
and need a nanny? Wait.
I'm putting my thinking cap on.
Does the DNA belong to Tom Macgregor?
How did you know?
Because I'm amazing, too.
What's up, Jane?
Hey, Korsak, you see a suit of armor anywhere in that house?
I do. At the top of the stairs.
All right, I'm getting you a warrant. Bring it back.
All right.
These are the last of the boxes from Emma's lair.
I'll take these. You take those.
Maura, come on. Yes or no?
1.5 centimeters.
Well, a gauntlet like this
made the tool marks on Isabelle Dubois' cheekbone.
"A gauntlet like this"?
How many 16th-century gauntlets
are just laying around?
That's my job.
You're taking too long!
I want to know if there's blood.
That's blood.
Found something.
Isabelle and Emma knew
knew Tom MacGregor's campaign manager, Dan Hargrove.
They were campers together,
and Dan was their counselor.
Okay, here's a theory.
Dan introduces Isabelle to his friend, Tom MacGregor.
Oh, can I try?
What? You just did my test.
It's guessing. You'll get hives.
It's theorizing.
Tom MacGregor gives Isabelle rohypnol
and he rapes her.
She feels the effects of the drug
and tries getting away.
I will raise your theory.
He backhands her with the gauntlet so hard,
it splits her face open, then panics, strangles her,
and calls Dan the fixer to get rid of the body.
I'll match and double.
Isabelle's body turns up.
Emma's got a problem
because she lied to the police 10 years before.
Zero credibility.
Has to find another way
to get justice for her dead friend.
Publicly humiliate Tom MacGregor.
Could Emma have figured out from these photos
that Isabelle was struck with that gauntlet?
Well, if we're still playing "Theory," yes.
That's what she was doing in the house.
She was looking for the gauntlet.
Dr. Isles, do you see something?
I do.
Arm hair caught in the chain mail.
Let's get it processed.
Okay, how 'bout we start by you telling me
when my family's antique suit of armor is gonna be returned?
Just so we're clear,
neither one of you know her.
Let me handle this, Tom.
No.
And you'd never met her
before she came here to work as a nanny.
We've been through this. No.
That's weird.
Seems like you'd know the names of your campers.
You spent three weeks with them.
What the hell?
Isabelle wrote this note the night she disappeared.
"He says he'll be my 'knight in shining armor.'
Gag me with a spoon.
But I'm going tonight."
She was coming here, wasn't she, Tom?
Don't answer that.
I'm calling your lawyer.
Might want to call yours, too.
We thought you were the desperate guy
who wanted to be Isabelle's knight.
But it was you.
We found traces of rohypnol
in Isabelle's remains.
You slipped her a roofie.
And then you strangled her
because she liked Tom more than you.
You probably roofied Tom, too.
Tom...
That's why I woke up next to a dead girl.
Tom...
You let me think I did that, you son of a --
Hey, hey! Relax!
I don't know what you're talking about.
You can't prove any of this.
We can prove you knew both of them and lied about it.
I'm pretty sure we can prove you were wearing that gauntlet
when you struck Isabelle.
So...
was Emma trying to get the gauntlet
when you pushed her down the stairs?
I mean, she could trust you, right?
You were her old camp counselor.
You'd help her get justice.
Here, Jane.
That's blood.
And you're under arrest for the murder --
Where are you going, huh?
You are under arrest
for the murders of Emma Spencer and Isabelle Dubois.
Put your hands behind your back.
I'm innocent.
You're an accessory after the fact.
Maybe you should have said something
instead of helping Dan get rid of Isabelle's body.
Looks like the campaign's over, boys.
Come on. Let's go.
Oh, should we join her?
She's sitting by herself.
There's a reason I'm by myself.
I prefer it.
Well, they say the devil never drinks alone.
Jane.
Can I buy you a beer, sister?
No, thank you, Miss Rizzoli.
"The Sound and the Fury" by Faulkner.
I'm enjoying it.
"On the Angel's Wings of Desire."
Are nuns supposed to read that?
What's the matter?
Nothing.
You look hot.
No, I don't.
Are you having a pity party, "G"?
Do you -- do you want company for your pity party?
Come on.
Sorry about your candidate.
Yeah. Me too.
Guess I'll have to run myself
if I want any changes around here.
Oh, that's -- that's a good idea...
Yeah. Why stop at congressman?
Why not senator?
President?
Why not?
Think of all the interns.
Skirts optional.
