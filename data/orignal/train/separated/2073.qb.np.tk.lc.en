jessica pearson in court .
i haven &apos;t seen that in a while .
we took over an innocence project case .
he killed my girl !
but i believe that leonard bailey is innocent ,
and i &apos;m going to make sure that he gets the fair trial that he never had .
by tracking down some junkie witness ?
maria gomez never had a chance to be heard .
leonard bailey &apos;s alibi witness is dead .
that doesn &apos;t mean her testimony is .
you want me to testify to what she told me ?
my protégé took the liberty of drawing up a sword affidavit .
you can either sign it
or you can lie under oath that this isn &apos;t true .
are you saying that this case needs to be re @-@ opened
based on leonard bailey having inadequate representation ?
it sure as hell is our plan now .
you set me up .
i &apos;m gonna make sure the world knows it .
you can tell the world anything you want , william .
but you got no proof .
either way , i suggest you sign this deal .
hello ?
hey , it &apos;s me .
i &apos;m coming home .
we did it .
we did .
whoa , how many people are joining us ?
wasn &apos;t sure which scotch you &apos;d want ,
so i went ahead and ordered them all .
what if i &apos;m in the mood for a beer ?
you just got out of prison .
you &apos;re not in the mood for a beer .
yeah , you &apos;re right .
welcome home .
oh , damn that tastes good .
that &apos;s not even the best thing i have for ya .
it &apos;s an offer letter .
take a look at the number .
this is the same money i made as a junior partner .
because you are a junior partner .
the best there is . and we need you .
i just got out of prison . i &apos;m not trying to go back .
you &apos;re not going back ,
because even though you &apos;ll be acting as a lawyer ,
your title &apos;s gonna be &quot; consultant . &quot;
look , harvey , i appreciate the gesture , but ...
everyone left that firm because of me .
i &apos;m not gonna do that to you again .
mike--
no , listen to me .
you &apos;ve done enough , you don &apos;t have to do this for me .
i &apos;m not doing this for you . i &apos;m doing it for me .
i miss working with you .
i miss working with you , too .
then do me a favor : just think about it .
if the answer &apos;s still &quot; no &quot; in a few days ,
i won &apos;t bring it up again .
because you &apos;re never here , that &apos;s why !
we &apos;ve been over this , virginia .
i do my part .
that &apos;s the problem , alan .
you think your part is just getting a paycheck .
a paycheck ?
this family lives like no other family we know .
jessica , honey--
what &apos;s going on ?
we &apos;re just having an argument .
it &apos;ll be okay .
you don &apos;t need to sugarcoat things for her , alan .
and you &apos;d know this if you were ever here
instead of out doing whatever it is you &apos;re doing .
what i &apos;m out doing is saving lives , and you know it .
well , maybe if you worked as hard on our relationship
as you do for your patients ,
what &apos;s happening wouldn &apos;t be happening .
what &apos;s happening ?
your father and i are taking a little break for a while .
how long ?
i don &apos;t know , baby .
i don &apos;t know .
harvey ?
i &apos;d love to chit chat , but i &apos;ve got trial in an hour ,
so unless it &apos;s urgent ...
i just wanted to thank you .
for mike .
you don &apos;t have to thank me for that .
i wanted him out as much as you did .
i know , but you didn &apos;t have to back me when it came to sutter ,
and you did .
you would &apos;ve done the same for me .
and now that he is out ,
let &apos;s get back to the business of keeping this firm alive .
if i were you , i would start by locking up jim reynolds .
excuse me ?
what &apos;re you talking about ?
i &apos;m talking about the fact that your first client
is shopping for another attorney behind your back .
don &apos;t tell me , you &apos;re about to pounce .
i &apos;m not trying to poach your client , harvey .
but if you can &apos;t keep him , i will .
i appreciate you coming down here , robert ,
but it &apos;s not exactly your style
to give the competition a heads @-@ up .
when i was kid ,
the yankees and the red sox were the best damn rivalry ever .
what &apos;s your point ?
my point is ,
after bucky dent hit that
beautiful home run in &apos; 78,
the sox fell off a cliff .
it wasn &apos;t any fun anymore .
you &apos;re saying you don &apos;t want to dominate the division ?
i &apos;m saying you fell off a cliff .
and if you want a chance to get back in the game ...
we better keep jim reynolds .
and you better get on it right now .
because i may not be looking to pounce ,
but every firm in this city is .
damn it .
the last thing we need is jim reynolds leaving right now .
what happened to calling , like he did last time ,
instead of going behind our backs ?
i &apos;ll tell you what happened .
he &apos;s getting pressure from his board like he said he would .
and you said we &apos;d get back on our feet by the end of the month
and we did .
and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;re gonna tell them .
what do you mean me ?
did you not hear what i just told you five minutes ago ?
i &apos;ve got trial in an hour .
i don &apos;t care .
you &apos;ve been his lead attorney since they got here .
if you don &apos;t go over yourself , we &apos;re gonna lose him .
then take louis with you .
jessica--
harvey , all you have to do is open up our books
and show them we &apos;re standing on solid ground .
or you can make this the priority and get a continuance .
it &apos;s a death row appeal , harvey .
how &apos;s it gonna look if i start a trial saying that my business
is more important than a man &apos;s life ?
you don &apos;t say that .
you come up with some other reason .
whatever reason i come up with ,
that prosecutor &apos;s gonna make it look like i don &apos;t care .
and i &apos;m not taking that risk .
jessica--
no , enough .
you want to thank me for having your back with mike ,
then take care of this .
donna , where the hell is gretchen ?
i have no idea .
well , you need to find her .
harvey , what &apos;s going on ? what do you need her for ?
i don &apos;t need her , i need louis ,
and i don &apos;t know where he is .
well , why didn &apos;t you start with that ?
he had an emergency meeting with a client and he ran out of here .
when ?
half an hour ago .
i saw him at the elevators before he left .
you tell him the second he gets back
i need to talk to him .
harvey , what &apos;s going on ?
jim reynolds is threatening to leave .
what ?
harvey , i was there the night he put jessica on notice .
if he &apos;s leaving , then you don &apos;t have time to wait for louis .
i know , but if i can &apos;t make it work with reynolds ,
i &apos;m gonna need louis the second i get back .
i &apos;m on it .
what the hell is this ?
you know what that is . it &apos;s a subpoena .
i signed your affidavit . you have what you need .
did you really think you wouldn &apos;t have to testify
that bailey had an alibi ?
what i didn &apos;t think was that you were going to
paint me as incompetent .
we did what you should &apos;ve done 12 years ago .
represent your client .
and you weren &apos;t even forming sentences
when i handled this case .
well , i &apos;m forming sentences now , so instead of being angry ,
you should be thanking us for not bringing an action
against you on leonard &apos;s behalf .
bring it on .
georgina , you made a mistake .
we &apos;re giving you the chance to fix it
whether you like it or not .
i don &apos;t give a shit what you think you &apos;re doing .
i &apos;m not here to fix it .
i &apos;m here because of this .
then i &apos;ll see you on the stand .
harvey , what &apos;re you doing here ?
i &apos;m here to stop you from breaking your word .
then i suggest you turn around
and walk out of here as fast as you can .
look , just hear me out .
the night you spoke to jessica ,
we &apos;d lost 75 % of our revenue stream .
but since then--
listen to me .
my taking meetings has nothing to do with your revenue stream .
then what the hell &apos;s this about ?
it &apos;s about the rumors that you tanked
william sutter &apos;s case .
i didn &apos;t tank shit .
i told him that .
i don &apos;t believe any of it .
well , it doesn &apos;t matter what you believe , jim .
because the board believes it .
and let me guess , you &apos;re the board .
donald mannis .
i &apos;d shake your hand , but i wouldn &apos;t want your
shady ethics rubbing off on me .
the only thing that &apos;s rubbing off on you , donald ,
is a load of bullshit from william sutter .
your former associate was in prison with his son @-@ in @-@ law ,
and the day sutter goes down , your guy gets out .
you may call that bullshit ,
but his story adds up to me .
and this company can &apos;t have an attorney
who &apos;s willing to turn on his own client .
you see what i &apos;m dealing with ?
i only took those meetings because i &apos;m being pressured
to take those meetings .
i get it . that asshole wants your job .
he doesn &apos;t just want it .
if i don &apos;t let you go , he &apos;s gonna get it .
and the one thing that might &apos;ve changed that was jessica
coming in here and showing him how important we are to her .
you are important to her , jim .
but jessica &apos;s in trial right now .
then you should &apos;ve sent louis litt ,
because the last thing that asshole needed to see
when he walked in here was you .
your honor , permission to treat the witness as hostile .
on what grounds ?
the witness hasn &apos;t even said anything yet .
on the grounds that five minutes ago ,
she told me she &apos;d sooner deny leonard bailey
a new trial than to risk looking incompetent .
is this true ?
yes .
then permission granted .
ms. casey , when you were leonard bailey &apos;s public defender ,
did he tell you that at the time of the murders ,
he was in the apartment of a woman named maria gomez ?
yes .
which means he not only had an alibi ,
he had a witness that could testify to it .
is that correct ?
yes .
then why in god &apos;s name didn &apos;t that witness ever take the stand ?
because she left town without telling anyone
right before the trial started .
did you try to locate her ?
yes , i did .
how hard did you look ?
i did my best .
the truth is , you didn &apos;t look for her at all , did you ?
that &apos;s not true .
i did everything i could to try to find her .
but you didn &apos;t .
and if you had ,
there would have been an alibi witness
that would &apos;ve told the jury that he couldn &apos;t have possibly
have committed those murders .
that witness was a drug addict with a prior conviction ,
and she would have been eviscerated on the stand .
then why did you try to find her at all ?
let me suggest an answer .
you did try to find her , because you knew if you did ,
leonard bailey would be found innocent .
but you dropped the ball .
leonard bailey went to death row .
and you &apos;d rather let him stay there
than to admit the truth .
ms. casey , in your estimation ,
was leonard bailey innocent ?
objection , your honor , calls for a conclusion .
your honor ,
they opened the door to this when they put her on the stand ,
and no one is more qualified to answer than his own attorney .
i &apos;ll allow it . ms. casey ?
i thought leonard bailey was guilty .
and i still do .
louis , the next time you have an emergency meeting ,
you better clear it with me .
i &apos;ll keep that in mind for the future , harvey .
but the reason i had an emergency meeting was you .
what the hell are you talking about ?
jensen analytics heard a rumor you tanked sutter &apos;s case
and they &apos;re threatening to walk .
shit . what &apos;d you tell them ?
what do you think i told them ?
i told them william sutter &apos;s a lying son of a bitch
who &apos;ll do or say anything to get what he wants .
what did they say ?
they said if jessica &apos;s oldest client &apos;s leaving ,
why should they stay ?
goddamn it .
harvey , if they think that , then it &apos;s just a matter of time
until all our clients think that .
which means we need to get jim reynolds to stay .
what &apos;re we gonna tell jessica ?
we &apos;re gonna tell her if she doesn &apos;t do something
about reynolds soon , she &apos;s not gonna have a firm
to come back to .
rachel , listen to me , it went as well as it could &apos;ve .
you don &apos;t have to look so worried .
how can i not look worried ?
mike , that woman said that she thought he was guilty
and the prosecutor got it on record .
and jessica got it on record that she was incompetent
before he did that .
the jury heard it .
yeah , but you saw the jury as well as i did .
they &apos;re not convinced .
put leonard on the stand .
mike , we haven &apos;t prepped him yet .
he &apos;s not ready .
rachel , just listen to me .
when i was on trial ,
i didn &apos;t just give the jury a reason to let me go .
you gave them a reason to want to let you go .
exactly , and it turns out , they were going to .
and i was guilty .
what do you think they &apos;re gonna do for a man
who &apos;s actually innocent ?
what are you doing here ?
i needed to see you .
me too .
had a rough day .
got some bad news .
you &apos;re a sight for sore eyes .
louis ...
what &apos;s wrong ?
i had a doctor &apos;s appointment this morning .
well , whatever it is , we can deal with it together .
modern medicine is a wonder .
there &apos;s almost nothing that they can &apos;t--
i &apos;m pregnant .
oh , my god .
i mean , i knew the litt sperm were powerful ,
but this has to be some kind of record .
louis .
don &apos;t tell me .
it &apos;s his .
louis , i &apos;m so sorry .
i didn &apos;t mean for this to happen .
i &apos;m usually so careful .
i don &apos;t care .
louis , i don &apos;t think you know what you &apos;re saying .
no , i know exactly what i &apos;m saying .
i love you .
and if being with you means raising another man &apos;s child ,
then i &apos;ll raise another man &apos;s child .
you say that now , but it hasn &apos;t sunk in yet .
that &apos;s not true .
i &apos;m gonna say the same thing tomorrow
and the day after that and the day after that .
then say it to me then .
but it has been a long day for both of us ,
and i think we should both just get some sleep .
tara , please come home with me .
good night , louis .
jessica , we have a problem .
not what i want to hear on my way out , harvey .
then you &apos;re not gonna want to hear that you need to be at
jim reynolds &apos; next board meeting .
that doesn &apos;t sound like you put out the fire .
what i couldn &apos;t put out were the rumors
that we threw sutter &apos;s case to get mike out .
are you kidding me ? that &apos;s what this is about ?
jessica , it &apos;s not jim .
he &apos;s loyal and always has been .
don &apos;t tell me . it &apos;s donald mannis
using this shit as a power play .
exactly . and i walked right into it ,
because i showed up without you .
son of a bitch .
jessica , the only thing we can do is hold onto reynolds
and hope the others fall in line .
all right , set up a meeting for tuesday morning .
the trial should be over by then .
but harvey , it won &apos;t make a bit of difference
if sutter &apos;s out there telling the world
we &apos;re the kind of lawyers that throw cases .
you do what you have to-- you shut that man the hell up .
who &apos;s he ?
leonard , this is my fiancé , mike .
he used to work at the firm and he has an idea .
let leonard tell his story .
that &apos;s risky .
we &apos;re giving them the chance to paint him
as a drug user and a criminal .
they &apos;re already doing that .
and they &apos;re not gonna stop .
leonard , this is as much your call as it is ours .
what do you want to do ?
i wanted to say my piece last time ,
but that lady didn &apos;t let me , so please ,
put me on that stand and give me a chance to say it now .
okay .
is the defense ready to call their next witness ?
the defense calls leonard bailey , your honor .
we &apos;d also like to request that ms. zane
be permitted to question the witness .
objection , ms. zane is a law student ,
not an admitted member of the bar .
she &apos;s also been a practicing paralegal
for the last eight years .
i don &apos;t care if she was the president of the united states .
she &apos;s not a lawyer
and they &apos;re laying grounds for a mistrial .
your honor , it &apos;s obvious mr. bailey &apos;s first attorney
didn &apos;t care about him at all .
but ms. zane fought to have this case taken on ,
and she &apos;s the reason we &apos;re even here today .
which is why mr. bailey is simply asking
that she be with him now .
so unless the prosecution is so unsure of its case
that he can &apos;t handle a law student ,
we ask that she be allowed to question the witness .
prosecution withdraws its objection .
then your request is granted .
harvey .
i thought i might get a visit from you .
and i thought i told you to keep your mouth shut .
well , i stopped taking advice from you when you sold me out .
now get the hell off my property before i call the police .
there &apos;s only one problem with that , william .
this isn &apos;t your property anymore .
what the hell are you talking about ?
at 8 : 00 a.m. tomorrow morning ,
it &apos;s being seized by the government .
bullshit .
this is a homestead state .
turns out , i did a little checking ,
and you closed on this house before you sold the last one ,
which means they can take it and they &apos;re going to .
what do you want ?
you &apos;re gonna repair my reputation .
and you &apos;re gonna start by
calling every member of jim reynolds &apos; board
and telling them that you spread those rumors about me
because you &apos;re a lying son of a bitch .
and what makes you think they &apos;ll believe me ?
because you &apos;re a hell of a salesman , william ,
when you &apos;re motivated ,
and i &apos;m pretty sure that when you get out of prison ,
you &apos;re gonna be motivated not to live on the street .
i was getting high with my friend maria .
i won &apos;t deny that .
but all i did to those kids was try and help them .
help them how ?
me and maria got hungry so we went to get something to eat .
that &apos;s when we saw them .
lying there on the sidewalk ...
with blood all over &apos; em .
maria , she , uh ... she freaked out ,
but i wasn &apos;t thinking , so i just ran up .
i mean , they were kids , you know ?
they--they were in trouble .
so then what happened ?
well , i yelled for maria to get help .
but the boy ...
he was already gone .
and the girl , she just kept asking for help ,
over and over .
i stayed with her .
and then the police came .
and the next thing you know ,
i was being charged with murder .
leonard ...
you were married before you went to prison , weren &apos;t you ?
my wife , she left me two years after i went away .
she said she couldn &apos;t handle it anymore .
and what about your children ?
do you still see them ?
i haven &apos;t seen my son in over ten years .
and i hadn &apos;t seen maya until you found her
and told her i was innocent
and you were going to prove it .
that &apos;s her right there .
leonard , is there something that you would like to say to her ?
i lost 12 years for a crime i didn &apos;t commit .
but i won &apos;t regret any of it
if it ends up being the thing
that got me clean and reunited with you .
because if i died
with you believing your father did this ...
she doesn &apos;t think that .
she knows that you didn &apos;t hurt those kids .
i have no further questions , your honor .
your honor , we reserve the right
to cross examine the defendant .
but for now , since he &apos;s claiming he knows
what it feels like to be an aggrieved father ,
i &apos;d like to call victor forrest to the stand .
thank you for agreeing to do this , mr. forrest .
i know how difficult it must be for you .
would you mind telling us a little bit about your daughter ?
what can i say ?
kim was our everything-- she was sweet , kind .
incredible sense of humor .
she played soccer , didn &apos;t she ?
used to watch her run up and down the field .
never got tired , she just kept running ,
big smile on her face .
she had such a beautiful smile .
it &apos;s obvious you loved her very much .
i didn &apos;t just love her . i tried to protect her .
i warned her about boys .
drugs .
and i said , &quot; if you &apos;re ever in trouble ,
you call me . &quot;
and the thing that gets me is ,
she did call that night .
not to say she was in trouble .
to say she was coming home .
but she never did make it home .
no , and i don &apos;t care what some junkie witness was gonna say .
they found that animal standing over my little girl &apos;s body .
her blood all over him .
he took away my everything in one night .
and he did it for money to buy more drugs .
and how do you feel about the speech he gave to the jury ?
he talked about getting a second chance with his family .
what about my family ?
our lives were ruined that night .
my little girl never even got a first chance .
no further questions , your honor .
mr. forrest ...
did you actually see leonard bailey kill your daughter ?
of course i didn &apos;t , but that doesn &apos;t mean--
no further questions , your honor .
donna , can i talk to you for a second ?
well , since you asked so nicely ,
i &apos;ll even give you two .
i have some bad news i have to give louis ,
and since he and i are finally in a good place ...
you want to know how to break it to him
without blowing things up again .
yeah .
how bad is it ?
it &apos;s not good .
then do what you just did with me .
approach him with respect , pull the band @-@ aid off ,
and if you have that same look on your face
as you do right now ,
he &apos;ll send you on your way with a handshake .
thanks , donna .
stu ?
it was nice having you here .
what ?
you should &apos;ve seen yourself thunder away at kendrick today .
you were amazing .
and if i were dawson or downey
and i had to choose between you and your father
to represent me on this ,
i &apos;d choose you any day of the week
and twice on sunday .
what &apos;re you talking about ?
i &apos;m talking about &quot; a few good men . &quot;
mike , i don &apos;t have time for movie quotes right now .
i &apos;m not trying to quote a movie , rachel ,
i &apos;m trying to tell you that it doesn &apos;t matter
what that girl &apos;s father said .
you &apos;re still in this ,
and you were great up there .
wait a minute , her father .
what about him ?
he called maria a junkie witness .
how would he even know that she was a drug user ?
what do you mean ? the same way i would know .
leonard and his public defender said so on the stand .
no , but he used those exact words when he came at me
trying to get me to drop this whole thing .
he came at you ?
it &apos;s fine , i handled it .
but he did try to intimidate me .
and a man who would intimidate you
might do the same thing to maria gomez .
yeah , but i don &apos;t think he intimidated her .
i think he did the opposite .
what &apos;re you saying ?
i &apos;m saying i think we need to pay that man a visit .
louis , do you have a minute ?
tell you the truth , stu ,
i kind of have a full plate right now ,
so unless it &apos;s a matter of life and death ,
i &apos;d rather it wait .
this can &apos;t wait .
we have to move out .
what do you mean , &quot; move out &quot; ?
we &apos;re relocating .
i wanted to tell you in person
so there &apos;s no hard feelings .
oh , bullshit , you can &apos;t do this .
louis , i don &apos;t have a choice .
sutter went bankrupt two days ago ,
and they owed us under their contract .
they &apos;re offering us their space to cover their obligations
and i have to say yes by tomorrow .
you wouldn &apos;t even have those obligations , stu ,
if it weren &apos;t for us .
i know that , but i can &apos;t tell my bosses
i &apos;m passing on a fortune in free rent
&apos;cause you guys did me a solid .
well , then you tell them you have a lease
and i &apos;m gonna sue your goddamn ass .
louis , there &apos;s a clause in the lease
that gives me a 30 @-@ day out and you know it .
stu , please .
you cannot do this to us now .
not tonight .
i &apos;m sorry , louis .
i hate to hang you out to dry
and if i could help you in another way , i would .
but we can &apos;t rent this space .
i have nothing to say to you .
please , mr. forrest , you confronted me
when i didn &apos;t want to talk to you ,
and i gave you the respect to hear what you had to say .
you can at least hear what we have to say .
you got 60 seconds , then i &apos;m calling the police .
go ahead , but when they get here ,
we &apos;ll tell them all about how you sent maria gomez away
so that she couldn &apos;t testify .
that &apos;s insane .
is it ?
because a woman who was never in the court record as a drug user
went to a rehab facility she could never afford
and you know enough about her
to call her a druggie to my face a month ago .
that &apos;s not proof of anything .
and that &apos;s not the answer of an innocent man .
look , mr. forrest ,
i can &apos;t begin to understand what you &apos;ve been through ,
but right now , the wrong man is sitting on death row
because of what you did .
i didn &apos;t do shit .
please .
can &apos;t you imagine what this has been like for leonard bailey ,
what his life has looked like for the past 12 years ?
the only thing i want to imagine
is what my life &apos;s gonna be like
after that man takes his final breath .
your time is up .
louis , is everything okay ?
what do you mean ?
i mean , i saw what happened with stu .
i know he &apos;s leaving , but it &apos;s gonna be okay .
harvey &apos;s gonna fix things with jim reynolds ,
we &apos;re gonna get more clients--
tara &apos;s pregnant .
it &apos;s not mine .
what did you tell her ?
i told her i &apos;m going to stay with her
and support her every way i can ,
because i &apos;m in love with her .
and what did she say ?
she said we need to sleep on it
because it hasn &apos;t sunk in for me .
then what were you so upset about ?
what if she &apos;s saying that
because she can &apos;t decided what she &apos;s gonna do ?
louis--
how do i know she didn &apos;t wake up this morning
and decide to run back to him ?
that &apos;s not what &apos;s going on .
this is a huge decision
and she wants to make sure
that you &apos;re in it for the long haul .
donna , i would never go back on my word .
that &apos;s not true and you know it .
you make impulsive decisions
and you go back on them all the time .
this is different .
how ?
because it &apos;s a baby .
i would never do that to a baby .
i hear you , but all i &apos;m saying is ,
don &apos;t do something rash .
because this isn &apos;t something you can change your mind about .
you got to be kidding .
you went to see the victim &apos;s father without telling me ?
jessica , we didn &apos;t have time and we had to know .
and like you taught harvey and harvey taught me ,
it &apos;s better to ask forgiveness than permission .
you &apos;re not asking for either one .
you &apos;re asking me to accuse the man
of obstruction of justice in open court .
jessica , we looked the man in the eye ,
and i &apos;m telling you , he did it .
i don &apos;t give a shit if he did it or not .
there &apos;s no way on the planet we can prove it .
we don &apos;t have to prove it if you can break him on the stand .
are you out of your goddamn mind ?
it &apos;s the only way--
it &apos;s not the only way .
and i &apos;m not doing it .
what &apos;re you so afraid of ?
don &apos;t you dare say that to me .
that man &apos;s life is in my hands
because your fiancée told him not to take the deal .
and if we attack the father and it backfires ,
we lose the jury for good and his life is over .
jessica , this guy wants to tell everyone the truth
because he &apos;s proud of it .
you just need to lead him right where he &apos;s dying to go .
and what if i can &apos;t do that ?
mike has something that might help .
what &apos;re you talking about ?
i &apos;m asking if you &apos;ve seen the movie &quot; a few good men . &quot;
donna , what &apos;re you doing here ?
waiting for you .
because i &apos;ve been calling you and texting you
and you obviously haven &apos;t checked your phone .
i haven &apos;t checked my phone
because i &apos;ve been going to every client
we have reassuring them
that sutter &apos;s gonna recant his bullshit
and jim reynolds isn &apos;t going anywhere .
yeah , well , if you don &apos;t do something soon ,
you &apos;re gonna have to recant that .
what the hell are you talking about ?
jim reynolds called .
they moved his board meeting to tomorrow .
we need to talk .
i don &apos;t believe this .
i &apos;m about to give the most important cross examination in my life
and you &apos;re showing up now ?
jessica , we left you a dozen messages .
jim reynolds &apos; board moved up the meeting .
then tell them to push it back because i can &apos;t go right now .
goddamn it , don &apos;t you get it ?
they moved it up so they can get it over with .
they &apos;re gonna fire reynolds and they &apos;re fire us .
and he made it clear that you need to be there .
jessica , louis is right .
if we show up without you ,
we may as well not show up at all .
is the defense ready to proceed ?
your honor , i &apos;d like to ask for a half @-@ day continuance .
on what grounds ?
it has to do with my law firm &apos;s survival .
then let her associate take the reins for half a day .
she &apos;s not ready for this .
well , she was ready for the other thing .
that was different and the prosecution knows it .
what i know is whatever &apos;s happening with your firm
is not my concern .
so either let your associate handle this
or handle it yourself .
but this case is moving forward .
do whatever you can .
i &apos;m not abandoning leonard to some corporate power struggle .
this isn &apos;t a goddamn power struggle .
we &apos;re gonna go out of business .
i can &apos;t think about that right now , louis .
that man &apos;s life is on the line ,
and i &apos;m not hanging him out to dry .
ms. pearson , are you ready to proceed ?
we are , your honor .
defense would like to recall victor forrest to the stand .
jessica , what a surprise .
you never come to my office .
when did you get home from school ?
this morning .
oh , if i &apos;d known you were coming--
i didn &apos;t want you to know , dad .
i have some news .
what is it ?
is everything okay ?
i got into harvard law next year .
and i &apos;m going .
what ?
i &apos;m going to be a lawyer .
what happened to our plan of you becoming surgeon ?
that was never our plan , dad . it was always yours .
don &apos;t you speak to me like that .
i &apos;m not speaking to you like anything .
i &apos;m telling you the truth .
you want the truth ?
doctors save lives and lawyers are nothing but
power @-@ hungry bottom @-@ feeders .
they don &apos;t have to be and i &apos;m not going to be .
and i raised you better .
no , dad .
you raised me to do what inspires me .
and what inspires me is to be a lawyer .
you go to that school ,
you &apos;re gonna get infected with their lawyer mind @-@ set
and when you come out ,
you &apos;re not gonna give a shit about your fellow man .
if you think that ,
then you should &apos;ve spent more time with me .
because you don &apos;t know me at all .
ms. pearson ?
ms. pearson , are you ready ?
mr. forrest ...
so many lives were ruined that night .
your daughter &apos;s , her boyfriend &apos;s , yours .
is there a question ?
someone had to pay for that , didn &apos;t they ?
yeah , they sure as hell did .
is that why you paid for maria gomez
to go to rehab to keep her from testifying
at mr. bailey &apos;s trial ?
what ?
objection , your honor ,
she &apos;s putting the victim on trial .
my client is the victim here .
ms. pearson , you better back this up fast .
then ask the witness to answer my question .
i never even heard of that woman until yesterday .
your honor , the defense would like to admit into evidence
the admissions form for an allison dobsen
into the pathways rehabilitation center from 12 years ago .
wha--who is that ?
she was maria gomez &apos;s roommate .
and i &apos;m gonna put her on the stand .
no , that &apos;s can &apos;t be . no--you can &apos;t do that .
and she &apos;s going to say that maria told her
that she felt terrible about abandoning her friend .
objection , hearsay .
no , she won &apos;t .
overruled .
and she &apos;s going to testify
that you paid for maria to be there .
i had nothing to do with anything .
that &apos;s not what she &apos;s going to say .
i don &apos;t care , she &apos;s lying .
why would she lie ?
she just wants to put the record straight .
the record is straight .
not according to her roommate .
she &apos;s lying !
objection , badgering .
how could you know ?
because maria gomez didn &apos;t have a roommate !
what did you just say ?
yes , i paid for her .
because she &apos;s a junkie who &apos;d say anything
to get him out of what he did , so i got her out of the way
&apos;cause he did it .
mr. forrest--
he did it !
your honor ...
the defense asks that mr. bailey be exonerated
and his sentence be commuted immediately .
mr. marsden ?
we have no objections , your honor .
then the jury may be excused .
and mr. bailey ...
you &apos;re free .
i can &apos;t believe it .
we did it .
we did it .
i can &apos;t thank you enough .
you don &apos;t have to thank me , leonard .
you just have to walk out that door .
that was one hell of a cross .
well , i &apos;d like to say it was no big deal ,
but i &apos;d be lying if i didn &apos;t say
it was the most satisfying moment of my entire career .
what &apos;s this ?
got a call from jim reynolds .
he said that if you didn &apos;t show today ,
they were gonna sign with me .
and we both know you didn &apos;t show .
you want to merge ?
i said all that stuff about rivals
because i didn &apos;t want to say this in front of harvey .
but i know you tanked the sutter case for mike
and i can see what you &apos;ve been doing for rachel .
so this isn &apos;t just professional .
for me , it &apos;s personal .
robert--
jessica ,
you got to knock down the mountain .
without help , you &apos;re not gonna be able get back up .
please , take my hand .
i appreciate your offer
more than you know , robert .
but i &apos;ve had my name first for too long .
i can &apos;t go back to having it last .
jessica , if you don &apos;t do this ,
you &apos;re not gonna have it anywhere .
then so be it .
besides , we both know lawyers are nothing but
power @-@ hungry bottom @-@ feeders , anyway .
you two don &apos;t look like jessica pearson .
then again , it doesn &apos;t really matter ,
because in 15 minutes , your firm is no longer going to be
in the employ of this company .
maybe not .
but while we are ,
i think you &apos;re gonna need one more chair .
what &apos;re you talking about ?
we &apos;re talking about your brand new largest shareholder .
what shareholder ?
hey , guy . stu buzzini .
this one at the head of the table looks good to me .
look , i don &apos;t care who you are
or how many shares you bought .
you &apos;re not a member of this board .
no , but as of next quarter , i will be .
so either you keep these two as your lawyers
and jim reynolds as your ceo ,
or at our next meeting , you &apos;ll be out on your ass .
you can &apos;t do this to me .
that &apos;s where you &apos;re wrong , donald .
we can and we did .
because he just bought up your company
and you messed with the wrong goddamn marine .
what the hell are you talking about ?
yeah , what are you talkin &apos; about ?
he &apos;s quoting &quot; a few good men . &quot;
finally , somebody gets me .
i got your back , bro .
don &apos;t bro me , dude .
you got it , chief .
hey , can i get in on this ?
no .
i got you a present .
you didn &apos;t have to do that .
i know .
i know we &apos;re not supposed to take pictures in there ,
but i couldn &apos;t help myself .
this is unbelievable .
no .
what you did for that man is unbelievable .
harvey offered me a job .
back to the firm ...
as a consultant .
what are you gonna do ?
i don &apos;t know .
what is that , a cup of tea ?
just a moment of quiet reflection .
well , to hell with that .
this is a moment for celebration .
that &apos;s right .
&apos;cause a man &apos;s life wasn &apos;t the only thing saved today .
don &apos;t tell me .
you managed to lock down jim reynolds after all .
we did .
the firm is safe , jessica .
thank you .
but it &apos;s not my firm anymore .
it &apos;s yours .
what do you mean , &quot; ours &quot; ?
i mean , i &apos;ve decided to step down .
what ?
jessica--
listen , somewhere along the way ,
i forgot why i became a lawyer in the first place .
and it wasn &apos;t just to fight for money and power .
it was to fight for something more .
bullshit , you &apos;re not fighting for something more ,
you &apos;re running away .
louis--
no .
we bust our ass to save this goddamn place ,
she decides to up and leave ?
we committed to this .
louis , she isn &apos;t doing this to you .
she &apos;s doing it for herself .
i don &apos;t give a shit why she &apos;s doing it .
it &apos;s selfish and self @-@ serving and it &apos;s not gonna happen .
do you think i want to goddamn want do this , louis ?
i have to do this .
you can &apos;t just throw this all away
after we gave everything to save it .
that &apos;s enough .
louis , after the partners left ,
we swore we were gonna dedicate every ounce of blood , sweat ,
and tears we had to this place .
but we didn &apos;t .
harvey and i focused on getting mike out ,
jessica and rachel focused on leonard bailey ,
and you focused on finding love in your life .
that &apos;s not true .
yes it is .
i &apos;m not ready to give up the firm .
no one &apos;s saying you have to give up the firm , louis .
you just have to let me go .
you sure about this ?
tell you the truth ,
for first time in my life ,
i &apos;m not sure about anything ,
and it scares the shit out of me .
but i &apos;m sure i have to do this .
to pearson specter litt .
to pearson specter litt .
you busy ?
of course not .
i know you told me to sleep on it .
i didn &apos;t know if that meant take a day , two days .
i &apos;ve never really been in this position before .
louis , i &apos;m sorry--
here &apos;s the thing .
i tried to sleep on it ,
and all i could do was picture a life without you
and your beautiful unborn baby
and it just made me crazy to think
i wouldn &apos;t be part a of it .
but tara , you need to know that i am not gonna say yes
today and change my mind tomorrow .
and i don &apos;t know how to give you that reassurance
without asking you something first .
oh , my god , louis .
tara messer .
will you marry me ?
yes , louis . i &apos;ll marry you .
jessica .
what &apos;re you doing here ?
i wanted to talk to you before you left for chicago .
i &apos;m glad , but i wouldn &apos;t have left without saying good @-@ bye .
i didn &apos;t just come here to say good @-@ bye .
i came to see what you think about me coming with you .
what about the firm ?
i &apos;m leaving the firm .
jessica , if you &apos;re walking away from everything for me--
no , i &apos;m not doing this just for you .
i &apos;m doing this for me .
i don &apos;t want to be a co @-@ operate lawyer any more .
so , if you don &apos;t want me to come to chicago with you ,
i won &apos;t .
but i &apos;m walking away
no matter what .
then walk away with me .
you gonna be okay ?
she was my mentor .
but yeah , i &apos;m gonna be okay .
you want to be alone ?
no .
