we have to tell him .
i hope he &apos;s okay .
walt , our elderly next door neighbor , died .
he and luke were pretty close ,
so we have to tell him .
i &apos;m a little nervous about it .
i think we should break it to him slowly .
like how ?
well , first we &apos;d say ,
&quot; luke , your friend walt has a cold .
you shouldn &apos;t go over there . &quot;
next day-- &quot; bad news . walt &apos;s in the hospital ,
but he &apos;s still cracking jokes with the nurses . &quot;
next day-- &quot; they &apos;re trying
an experimental drug .
fingers crossed . &quot;
next day-- &quot; his body rebelled .
he &apos;s in a coma . &quot;
next day--he rallies , next day--coma ,
next day--coma ,
next day--coma ,
next day--eye flutter--
stop . just stop . stop .
oh , luke , we have some bad news for you .
it &apos;s about walt .
i &apos;m afraid ...
he passed away .
um , it happened yesterday .
he finished writing an angry letter
to the postmaster general , and he just fell asleep .
okay .
it was very peaceful .
not the letter . that was full of threats , but ...
it &apos;s okay to be sad , honey .
you two were really good friends .
it must be quite a shock to hear that ...
walt &apos;s dead .
um , so do you wanna talk about it or ...
i &apos;m okay .
can i get back to my video game ? it &apos;s paused .
oh , um , sure .
yeah , buddy .
come here .
how weird was that ?
i know . crazy weird .
it &apos;s like he had no feelings at all .
i &apos;m more worried about the one you showed .
what &apos;s with all the smiling ?
what are you talking about ?
that grin .
&quot; walt &apos;s dead . &quot; you looked like the joker .
i didn &apos;t smile .
you did . it &apos;s like a weird coping mechanism .
you did the same thing when you told him his hamster died .
i don &apos;t know what you thought you saw , phil ,
but our child just got some terrible news
and had absolutely no reaction . doesn &apos;t that concern you ?
yeah . he probably just needs time to process it .
do you think ?
yeah , honey .
death is a profound thing to deal with at any age .
we all manage it differently .
some people lock up their feelings .
others ...
reach out for comfort ,
finding some way to reaffirm their connection to life--
you &apos;re joking .
第三季 第二十集
hola , haley .
gloria , i was driving by
and saw this outside your door , so here .
thank you .
no problem .
hey , so since i &apos;m already here ,
my friend was gonna have a pool party tonight ,
but he got sick . could we have it here ?
mm . good thing that you saw this paper
or if not , you would have never been able to ask .
yeah .
i &apos;m sorry , but jay and i are going
to mitch and cam &apos;s for dinner tonight .
i &apos;m just thinking out loud here .
what if i get a chaperone that my parents approve of ?
would it be okay then ?
well , i guess so .
you know , it would be good for manny to have a little bit of fun .
do you mind if he stays here for the party ?
mind ? the plan depended on him .
i don &apos;t suppose you &apos;ve thought of a chaperone ?
of course not , mom ,
because it &apos;s going to be a wild party
and i &apos;m trying to get away with something , as usual .
yes , i thought of a chaperone--
my uncle who already said he would do it .
but if that &apos;s gonna be a problem ,
i think i should just call everybody--
sorry .
sorry . sorry . it &apos;s fine .
and thank you , uncle manny .
can you help a little bit ?
this--if i--if i push down , does that ...
yeah , that &apos;s helping . that &apos;s helping .
no , it &apos;s not helping . it &apos;s &apos; cause it &apos;s stuck .
i can &apos;t believe i got &apos; em this stuck .
i &apos;ve built beds my whole life--
bunk beds , dog beds , cow beds .
okay , i &apos;m calling you on cow beds .
oh , that &apos;s my dad !
okay . he can help .
he &apos;s built a boat , a dock , a lake ...
uh , he did not build a lake .
okay , from now on , just stop after you say the second thing .
... so the cabin door swings open .
damned if there wasn &apos;t a lady pilot in there .
yeah , well ,
i hate to admit it , but it throws me , too .
i do prefer a man .
are we gonna have this conversation again ?
hey , merle .
hey . how are you ?
yeah , ooh . okay .
nice to see you .
all right , let me grab that for you .
no . no . i got it .
i will take that beer you were about to offer me , though .
oh , yeah . coming right up .
and you know where everything is . go have a seat .
oh , i missed a call from my dad .
oh , let me guess . is he calling to cancel ?
what &apos;s his excuse this time ?
you know , that &apos;s a really mean thing to assume , cam .
i really wish you &apos;d give my dad a break for once .
oh , please . you know jay doesn &apos;t like my dad .
he thinks he &apos;s some bumpkin from the sticks .
well , i will have you know that merle stonewall tucker
is one of the most respected farmers
in all of hell &apos;s hollow , missouri .
okay , you &apos;re not hearing yourself .
my dad likes him just fine . come on .
hello ? hey , dad . it &apos;s me .
mitch .
i &apos;m sick .
i gotta cancel tonight .
yeah . yeah , 6 : 00 . we &apos;re really looking forward to it .
what are you doing ? i just said i can &apos;t come .
i don &apos;t know . let me ask .
my dad wants to know red or white ?
um , uh , red .
red . and i &apos;m sorry .
okay . yeah , cam says red .
okay . yeah , he &apos;s--he &apos;s so happy--
knock it off , old man . you are not sick .
why do you always do this ?
okay , look , between you and me ,
mervis kind of bugs me .
okay , first of all , it &apos;s merle .
mervis isn &apos;t a name . mervis is a sound .
and second of all , he &apos;s-- he &apos;s my partner &apos;s father .
okay ? you &apos;re coming .
okay , dad , why don &apos;t you settle in ?
we don &apos;t have plans until dinner tonight with jay and gloria .
i @-@ i don &apos;t like that guy .
what ? that &apos;s--
you like everybody .
not jay . the guy rubs me the wrong way .
every time i try to do something nice ,
he makes this cranky face , like ...
okay . well , you know what ?
i &apos;m gonna chalk this up to jet lag
for you because it &apos;s not like you at all .
okay , you have to make an effort .
it &apos;s my partner &apos;s father .
now give me the growl that means &quot; okay . &quot;
good .
did you know walt had a daughter
he was completely estranged from ?
his lawyer said she wouldn &apos;t even honor his last request
to toss his dog tags in the ocean .
can you imagine ?
phil , do we really have to go through this again ?
i told you , i would do everything possible
to make sure that your skeleton
ends up in a science class at a women &apos;s college .
no , it &apos;s just sad .
that &apos;s half of what would keep me going in my old age--
remembering all the good times with the kids .
teaching luke to ride his bike ...
haley at the father @-@ daughter dance ...
taking alex for her first pony ride ...
you never took alex on a pony ride .
oh , right . that was just me .
but alex and i went ...
oh , no . that was haley .
phil , look . it &apos;s luke .
he &apos;s going into walt &apos;s house .
oh , he &apos;s saying good @-@ bye .
he just needed a little time .
it &apos;s so sweet and so sad .
he &apos;s so much more sensitive than i ever thought .
they had a special bond . i wouldn &apos;t be surprised
if one day he wrote a book like &quot; tuesdays with morrie . &quot;
i never read it .
did that guy steal morrie &apos;s tv ?
now setting a course for adventure !
i &apos;ve had great experiences with all my kids .
but i ... i might have fallen behind a bit with alex .
my fault completely .
adventure ? we are throwing dog tags
into an already polluted ocean
where they will probably choke an otter .
80 % my fault .
honey , we &apos;re bringing closure to a man &apos;s life .
we &apos;ll hike up to the scenic overlook ,
where apparently , walt proposed to his wife ,
wait for the light to be just right , say a few words ,
share some memories .
that &apos;s kind of poetic .
kind of navajo .
now you &apos;re getting it .
we &apos;ll be sending him off with a level of dignity ,
that if we &apos;re lucky , someday we &apos;ll experience , too .
it &apos;s called--
hey . what do you got there ? walt &apos;s old tv ?
he said i could take one thing after he died .
i wish he would &apos;ve said two things .
i would &apos;ve taken that phone with the big buttons .
i bet you guys had some really good times
watching this thing , right ?
no . i just wanted a tv in my room .
you know , luke ,
there might be a nicer way to honor walt &apos;s memory .
what do you mean ?
well , i mean , you guys liked to garden .
we could , uh , we could take one of his flowers
and plant it in our yard , and then every spring , when--
there we go .
sweetie , how are you feeling ?
you sad ? angry ?
confused ? frustrated ?
you know you can talk to me .
i know , but i can &apos;t see through you . could you scootch ?
no . no . you know , this is not okay .
it &apos;s going back .
what ? he said i could pick one thing .
this isn &apos;t picking .
it &apos;s looting , and it &apos;s going back .
you are so mean .
when walt used to look through those binoculars
and say , &quot; your dad &apos;s one lucky man , &quot; he was wrong .
hi , haley .
hi . stef , sam , this is manny .
what &apos;s up , dude ?
kitchen &apos;s over there and pool &apos;s in the back .
so where are your parents ?
they &apos;re not coming .
i was told there &apos;d be a chaperone .
there is . it &apos;s you .
my parents are totally fine with it .
well , exits ,
fire extinguisher , burn kit .
okay , let &apos;s have some fun .
i believe i was clear the bedrooms were off @-@ limits .
young lady , i don &apos;t think you &apos;re ready up here
for what you &apos;re planning to do up there .
ugh . not on my watch .
oh , this was a delicious meal , mitchell .
i wish my wife could cook a roast like this .
you got a good one there , son .
oh , well , i &apos;m very lucky , just like you and mama .
never had a bad patch .
except the winter of &apos; 85 . remember that ?
oh , i spent several nights in the cow bed then .
oh , here . let me help you .
no , no , no . you sit--sit down .
let--lets us guys catch up here a little bit .
i &apos;ll tell you why i don &apos;t like that guy--
and i could never say this to mitch--
he treats my son like the wife in the relationship .
always has .
before we get to dessert , i &apos;ve got some presents here .
oh , you didn &apos;t need to , dad .
love it !
oh , merle , thank you so much .
look at this . oh . so elegant , huh ?
oh , this is so sweet .
i think i might cry .
don &apos;t .
dad , i really gotta get home .
i know . i know . you gotta do homework .
but you can &apos;t expect me to see a sign that says ,
&quot; world &apos;s greatest milk shake--50 miles , &quot;
and not drive to it .
sorry , sweetie . machine &apos;s broken .
i just wanted a special day with my daughter ,
you know , like &quot; the time we gave an old man
a dramatic sendoff at the beach , &quot;
or--or &quot; the time we drove 100 miles
for the world &apos;s greatest milk shake . &quot;
call us when it happens , francine .
oh , it could be before you get home .
i &apos;m a week past my due date as it is .
what can i do for you ?
&quot; the time we delivered a baby . &quot;
we were the only ones there , and she was so close ,
the sound of a pin dropping could induce labor .
okay !
what looks good ?
what looks good ?
what looks good ?
wh @-@ whoa ! kids love to destroy things .
not manny . he &apos;s always been a little bit too serious .
i would make the buildings , and he would inspect them .
and if they weren &apos;t up to code , ay , ay , ay , the paperwork .
i remember cam , one time ,
rolled a tractor tire right through a chicken coop .
he was 3 at the time .
i remember mitchell , one time ,
karate @-@ chopped a plate glass window .
got 17 stitches .
ah , yes . i love that story .
which one of the charlie &apos;s angels he was being again ?
that &apos;s not important .
i think it was farrah .
yeah , the thing i remember is , when mitchell told that story ,
how--how he giggled all the way through .
i &apos;m sure he wasn &apos;t giggling .
oh , yeah , he--he was giggling , all right .
no , see , mitchell has a booming laugh .
it &apos;s cameron , actually-- has the high laugh .
you know ...
no , i think mitch has a higher laugh than--
it &apos;s ...
no , it &apos;s ...
listen to them .
listen to them .
best of friends .
oh , man . i &apos;m sorry i doubted jay .
he &apos;s been lovely .
oh , well , confession time--
he kinda didn &apos;t want to come .
well , you &apos;re gonna laugh
because my dad was kinda hoping he wouldn &apos;t .
wha ?
oh . they just needed to get to know one another better .
i am so glad that we did this .
yeah , me , too .
oh , that &apos;s so funny .
wh @-@ what did your dad not like about my dad ?
oh , well , you know jay . he &apos;s a teddy bear ,
but sometimes he can kinda come off as a tough guy .
yeah , that &apos;s true .
as an actual tough guy ,
you can kinda see how that would rub my dad the wrong way .
oh , it &apos;s--i @-@ i could see that , but , you know ,
my dad &apos;s actually pretty tough himself , so ...
oh , yeah , city tough ,
you know , not farm tough .
you mean cities , where there are gangs ,
as to opposed to farms , where there are ducks ?
oh , boy . it &apos;s really jammed in there .
yeah . why don &apos;t you hop on in there , dad ?
my dad &apos;s got it .
all right , let &apos;s see here .
hang on , merle .
wait . here . huh ?
hold . yeah , that &apos;s good .
oh . it &apos;s coming .
we got it . we got it .
oh , there you go . there you go .
cam , why don &apos;t you go get us a couple of cold ones ?
we &apos;ll finish this job up in here .
sure thing , dad . you earned it .
yeah . good helping there , merle . okay .
it &apos;s hot in here .
it &apos;s , like , 80 degrees .
he did that so the meals on wheels lady
had to take off her sweater .
how do we turn on the lights in here ?
of course .
so , luke , now that we &apos;re here ,
you wanna take a minute and say what walt meant to you ?
nope .
luke , you are going through something huge in your life ,
and i &apos;m concerned that you &apos;re not processing it
in a normal , healthy way .
i &apos;m sad . i &apos;m so very sad .
no , i don &apos;t just wanna hear what you think i wanna hear .
i want you to really tell me--
hi .
it &apos;s kim with meals on wheels .
hi , luke . where &apos;s walt ?
it is like a sauna in here . how does he stand it ?
walt ! i &apos;m waiting for my hug !
i have some sad news about walt .
he &apos;s dead .
what ?
he died last night .
are you joking ?
no . he had a heart attack .
a man died . you &apos;re-- you &apos;re smiling .
i &apos;m not smiling .
you are , mom . it &apos;s kinda creepy .
well , hello ? walt ?
what &apos;s going on ?
something happen to walt ?
well , i &apos;m sure you can imagine .
he sick ?
he &apos;s in the hospital ?
oh , my god . just tell me .
mm ! okay .
he is ... dead .
he is ?
yeah , he &apos;s dead .
what are you doing with your mouth ?
nothing .
she &apos;s smiling . she thinks it &apos;s funny .
i don &apos;t . i don &apos;t think it &apos;s funny .
i &apos;m not smiling .
i &apos;m not leaving this with you .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m so sorry .
i just found out my face does this .
wow , mom . that was so wrong .
well , it &apos;s--it &apos;s called a coping mechanism , luke .
some people repress their feelings
and some people just smile . but d--it doesn &apos;t matter .
just put the tv in the den . let &apos;s get out of here .
it doesn &apos;t go in the den .
it goes right here .
i can see it from my room .
sometimes i &apos;d wake up in the middle of the night
and look down here .
if the tv was on , i knew he was up ,
and i don &apos;t know ,
i guess i &apos;m gonna miss that .
yeah . that &apos;s ...
yeah .
is that any better ?
yeah , it still feels just , you know , a little wobbly .
oh ! oh , my god . okay , no , no , no .
that &apos;s--that &apos;s fine . thank you . thank you .
okay , it &apos;s &quot; go &quot; time .
oh , hey , doc .
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s just a cramp .
can i get you guys anything else ?
please , no . he &apos;s already made me eat
the world &apos;s greatest everything on the menu .
dad , why are you acting like this ?
is this about walt dying ?
no . it &apos;s about what he didn &apos;t do when he was alive--
have a special bond with his daughter .
i don &apos;t want to be that kind of dad .
i want to be eugene cernan .
who &apos;s eugene cernan ?
&quot; apollo 17 &quot; astronaut ,
last man on the moon , coolest dad of all time .
when he was leaving the moon , he reached down
and wrote his daughter &apos;s initials into the lunar surface .
since there &apos;s no atmosphere--
there &apos;ll be there forever .
wow . so every time she looks in the sky ,
she knows there &apos;s a message just for her .
exactly . that &apos;s why dads everywhere hate eugene cernan .
oh , no .
okay , &quot; hate &apos;s &quot; a strong word . it &apos;s just--
i &apos;m trying to make--
oh . oh , boy .
honey . okay .
i really wanna help ,
but you know when someone yawns ,
it makes you yawn ?
you &apos;re not gonna yawn , are you ?
i already yawned a little in my mouth . oh , god .
jay , i want to thank you for helping me do this .
i know cam appreciates not having to do it all on his own .
what ? what &apos;s that face ?
you really wanna know ?
sure .
sometimes i think you treat my son
like the woman in their relationship .
what ?
like those watches .
cam &apos;s was all big and manly .
the other one looked like something
grace kelly would wear .
well , that &apos;s just because
mitch has a more slender wrist than cam does . that &apos;s all .
it &apos;s skinny , not slender .
and you &apos;re honestly telling me
you don &apos;t cast mitch in the more ladylike role ?
are you saying cam is the wife in this deal ?
i don &apos;t think about it that way .
it &apos;s not like it was in our day .
husband went out to work .
wife stayed home with the kids .
that sounds like a clever way of saying &quot; yes . &quot;
fine .
they &apos;re both equal .
neither one is the wife .
yeah . yeah .
i know that in my head .
it &apos;s just that it makes me feel a tiny bit better
to think that the person he &apos;s spending his life with
is a tiny bit of a woman .
i get it .
every time i start to feel comfortable with this thing ,
some new part comes up i gotta wrap my head around .
yeah , i guess we got no choice .
yep . we got two sons ,
and they &apos;re gay for each other .
i &apos;ll take it slow on the way home .
don &apos;t worry . canceling course for adventure .
you know what i &apos;ll never forget ?
the time my dad spent the entire day
trying to create a special memory for me .
or when a pregnant lady slipped in my vomit .
hang on .
i wanna do one thing before we go .
hey , you on your way home ?
just about . how &apos;s everything there ?
actually , it &apos;s pretty great .
i can &apos;t wait to see you .
me , too .
okay .
let &apos;s hit it .
i don &apos;t know .
i feel like maybe we should get some food on the way home .
don &apos;t .
maybe a nice tuna melt .
stop it .
i did what i could , mom . it was a nightmare .
i can &apos;t tell you how many times i turned off the bathroom light .
haley !
oh , crap . listen , gloria .
okay , everything i told you technically was not--
you lied to me
so that you could have a party without supervision !
oh , i had plenty of supervision .
he was running around all night with his coasters and vacuum
and his &quot; make good choices &quot; speech .
good . somebody needed to be responsible .
thank you .
not you . you take rules too seriously .
i &apos;m in trouble ?
you are 13 .
you &apos;re not supposed to be vacuuming the party .
you &apos;re supposed to be enjoying the party .
exactly .
a party that you shouldn &apos;t have been having !
it seems like you &apos;re sending mixed signals here .
yeah , maybe i should get my friends and just leave .
no , you &apos;re in trouble , little young lady .
you &apos;re having this party !
what ? they &apos;ve been using glassware by the pool ,
putting feet on the furniture ,
and begging girls to kiss each other .
yes ! all the things that you should have been doing !
yeah , all those things are fine .
go . have fun and go crazy .
but he &apos;s gonna ruin my party .
