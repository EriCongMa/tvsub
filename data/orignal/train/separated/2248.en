第一集
If this works,
we don't tell her everything, not right away.
Phillip?
Yes, Aurora.
I told you not to come after me.
How long have I been asleep?
What happened?
It doesn't matter. The worst of it is over.
Now that we're together,
we'll restore this castle and our kingdom,
and as we dreamt, we'll be here always.
Where is everyone?
Why does it need to be rebuilt?
It's a long story, and you, my love, need rest.
I've had my fill of rest.
Then come with me.
Our people have gathered in a new safe haven.
We must join them.
A safe haven? From maleficent?
No.
Worry not. She can no longer harm us.
First she goes after my mother, then me.
Forgive me if I'm still a bit wary.
Don't be.
There are new dangers now,
but nothing we can't handle.
What's happening?
Let's find out.
Oh! Snow?
Snow. Oh!
Your highness?
The curse? It's broken?
It would appear so.
So what do we do now?
Now?
Now I find my daughter.
So it's true.
You found us.
Grandpa?
Yeah, kid.
I suppose so.
She did it. She saved you.
She saved all of us.
I... Well...
Uh, then why are we still here?
That, my friend, is an excellent question.
And what was that smoke?
Who did this?
And what was that smoke?
And why?
And what was that smoke?
Magic.
It's here.
I can feel it.
Magic? In Storybrooke?
You're the blue fairy. Do something magical.
It's not quite that simple, Henry.
No wand, no fairy dust.
Matters are complicated now.
Let's go to the person responsible for bringing it--
The queen.
Yeah.
Yeah, the queen!
Yeah, let's get her.
Yeah, the queen.
No. Wait.
It wasn't Regina.
My darling Belle.
You have to tell me what happened to you.
I was abducted.
Regina.
She locked me away into her curse,
and I've been in the asylum ever since.
For 28 years.
All these years, you've been here,
alive.
Is--is that--is that why you did this?
Why you wanted magic, for revenge?
No, no,
but it might come in handy.
No. No.
I cannot let this stand, Belle. I will not let this stand.
Look...
Promise me.
Promise me you won't give in to your hate.
Promise me you won't kill her.
Promise me...
and we can be together.
Sweetheart...
I promise.
Is there anything that you wanna ask us?
You must have questions.
The only questions I have are for Mr. Gold.
Why did he double-cross me, and what did he do to this town?
Uh... Shouldn't we talk about...
it first?
What?
Us?
Your life? Everything?
Can we do "everything" maybe later,
like, with a glass of wine...
and several bottles?
I know it's a lot to take in,
for all of us.
And we don't want to push,
but we have waited for this moment for so long.
Yeah, so have I!
I've thought about this moment my entire life.
I've imagined who you might be.
But of all the scenarios that I concocted,
my parents being...
I-I just need a little time, that's--that's all.
Snow.
There you are.
Come with me. I need your help.
Dr. Whale's whipped everyone into a frenzy.
They're going to Regina's house.
They're gonna kill her.
Great. Let's watch.
No. No. We cannot stoop to her level.
No matter who she is or what she's done,
killing her is wrong.
He's right.
Please. She's still my mom.
We have to stop them.
If the blue fairy is right and magic is here,
Regina could have her powers back.
They could be marching into a slaughter.
Phillip!
What was that thing?
Something bad.
You, uh...
You wait here, Belle.
I'm gonna find you something to wear.
You've spent enough time in these rags.
Thank you.
Open up!
Open up, or we're coming in!
Can I help you?
That smirk isn't gonna last forever, Regina.
You took everything from us, and now--
What?
Now you're gonna kill me?
Eventually, but first you need to suffer.
Listening to you has been enough suffering for all of us.
That's right.
You wanted to see your queen?
Well, my dears,
here... she... is.
She's powerless!
What?
Get her! Don't let her get away!
Now... Uhh!
Where were we?
Let her go!
Let her go! Let her go!
Why should I listen to you?
Because I am still the sheriff.
And because she saved you, all of you.
And because no matter what Regina did,
it does not justify this.
We are not murderers here.
Well, we're not from this world.
Yeah, well, you're in it now.
Okay, Whale, we're done.
Back off. You're not my prince.
Who are you, Whale?
That's my business.
Well, my business
is making sure this town doesn't go to hell,
so whether or not I'm your prince isn't the issue.
We have a lot to figure out, and this isn't the way to do it.
And Regina's death won't provide any answers.
She needs to be locked up
for her safety,
and more importantly, for ours.
So I'm a prisoner now.
If the curse is broken, why didn't we go back?
Because there's nothing to go back to.
That land is gone.
We should get to Gold.
Magic is different here,
dearie.
I noticed.
I assume this is all your doing.
Most things are.
Get to it, Rumple. What do you want?
You here to finish the job?
No, no, no.
You're safe from me.
I feel so relieved.
I made a promise to someone that I won't kill you.
Who could elicit that from you?
Belle.
She's alive?
You are...
a dreadful liar.
I could've killed her, but I didn't.
Yeah, you did much worse than that.
You kept her alive
so you could kill her when it suited you--
A fate worse than death,
which, incidentally,
is exactly what I've got in store for you.
Is that...
Yes, dearie.
The one thing no one can escape...
Destiny.
And I promise,
yours is particularly unpleasant.
Qui shen.
In your land, you would call it a wraith.
I'm sorry. Who is this?
A friend.
You're...
a girl.
Woman.
My name is Mulan.
In your absence, she's helped me like no other.
We fought many battles together.
With a woman?
And now we have another to wage.
The qui shen, the wraith,
is one of the most dangerous creatures in all the known lands--
A soul sucker.
According to legend,
it marks its victims and removes their souls,
damning them for all eternity.
Those are the sounds of the souls its trapped trying to escape.
But fortune favored us as we all avoided the mark.
We need to begin our journey.
It's okay.
We'll be safe with our people.
Phillip, what is it?
Nothing. Everything is fine.
The dark one...
summons thee.
Keep him safe, Ruby.
Don't push it, Snow.
I won't.
You guys ready?
We need to talk.
I--well, I don't--
I just--I don't want to talk.
Well, I do.
Okay, Gold can wait. I can't.
And you're my daughter, and...
I want to talk to you.
I know that we have talked,
but we didn't know that we were talking,
and we talked about things we probably shouldn't have even talked about--
one-night stands and the like.
One-night stands?
Whale.
Whale?
We were cursed. That is neither here nor there.
The point is,
we did not know that we were mother and daughter,
and now we do, and so...
please, let's talk.
Okay.
What do you want to talk about?
We're together finally...
And I can't help but think you're not happy about it.
Oh, I am, but...
See...
here's the thing.
No matter what the circumstances,
for 28 years, I only knew one thing--
that my parents sent me away.
We did that
to give you your best chance.
You did it for everyone because that's who you are--
leaders, heroes,
princes and princesses,
and that's great and--and amazing and...
wonderful, but it doesn't change the fact
that for my entire life
I've been alone.
But if we hadn't sent you away,
you would have been cursed, too.
But we would've been together.
Which curse is worse?
Come on. Let's-- let's go find Gold.
We should camp here tonight.
The wraith only appears when light is absent.
That's why it ran when it first appeared.
Light is its adversary.
And you want to stop now?
It's looking for a mark-- something alive.
Our best bet is to be still until night passes.
She's right.
We have to rest here.
Here.
You should sleep.
No, I-I can't.
Just relax.
It'll come.
No, I mean, I won't sleep.
Not after what I just went through.
What's wrong?
I just missed you so much.
And now you don't have to.
I'm going to find wood to build us a fire.
I'll be back in five minutes.
That's a "see you in five minutes" kiss?
I'm making up for lost time.
I love you.
I love you, too.
What can I do for you?
What you can do is tell us what you did.
I'm sorry. You're gonna have to be more specific.
You know damn well what we're talking about.
You double-crossed Emma,
you, uh, took your potion from her...
And did who knows what to this town.
And worst of all, you risked Henry's life.
Well, that is quite a litany of grievances,
now isn't it?
Maybe I don't need answers.
Maybe I just need to punch you in the face.
Really, dearie?
Allow me to answer your questions with some of my own.
All right?
Did your dear boy Henry survive?
Yeah.
Is the curse broken?
And let's see, uh, Ms. Swan,
how long have you been searching for your parents?
Looks like you're reunited.
Seems like rather a punch in the face,
I deserve a thank-you.
Twist my words all you want.
What was the purple haze that you brought?
You know...
magic.
Why?
Not telling.
What the hell was that?
That is my gift to you.
That is gonna take care of Regina.
Emma, come on.
We need to go take care of this.
We're not done.
Oh, I know.
You still owe me a favor.
You lied to me.
No, I-I kept my word.
I will not kill her.
You know...
You toy with words
like you do people.
You're still a man who makes wrong choices.
I thought you changed.
What, in the hour you've known me?
Belle, I-I-I'm sorry.
Belle, I'm sorry.
I am.
Where's Phillip?
I thought he was in your tent.
He said he was making a fire.
I'm making the fire.
I can see that.
He left.
The horses are gone.
W-why would he leave?
Because he was marked.
What are you doing?
Going after him.
He's sacrificing himself for you.
No, for both of us. We have to get him.
I'm going alone. You'll only slow me down.
No, I won't slow you down. Mulan! Mulan!
Mulan, wait!
Mulan!
Mulan!
Hello? Who's there?
Over here!
What the hell was that thing?
A wraith!
A soul sucker.
Did I-- kill it?
No, it's regenerating.
It'll be back.
It doesn't stop until it devours its prey.
Me.
So how do we kill it?
There's no way.
You can't kill something that's already dead.
Then we have a problem.
No, we don't.
Regina does.
What?
David?
You want to let her die?
Why not? Then it goes away.
Then we're safe.
That's quite the example you're setting for your daughter there.
No. You don't get to judge us.
Let me ask you something.
Where do you think that thing came from?
Gold.
I made a promise to Henry.
She's not dying.
If it can't be killed, what do you suggest?
Send it somewhere it can't hurt anyone.
Did Henry really ask you to protect me?
Yes.
The hat.
You had it all along.
What do you mean?
That's Jefferson's hat.
Who's Jefferson?
Torches for when it comes back.
I know it's old-fashioned, but so am I.
So... How does it work?
It will open a portal to our land.
All we have to do is send the wraith in there.
Oh, yeah. Just that.
I don't understand.
I thought our land was gone.
It is.
But sending it to a place that no longer exists...
Well, that's banishing it to oblivion.
Regina.
I'm trying.
I found one of the horses.
I'm coming with you.
You need to stay here. It's dangerous.
I wasn't asking for your permission.
That thing out there is dangerous.
And Phillip...he left to protect you,
So even if I don't believe in his methods,
I'm gonna honor his wishes.
I'm gonna keep you safe.
I never asked him to.
You never had to.
Everything he does, he does for you,
And now he's gonna die for you.
Love is sacrifice--
something you clearly don't understand.
I'm not gonna let him face that alone.
He won't. But with all due respect, your highness,
Phillip's best chance is me.
You love him.
What?
Phillip. You love him, too.
I owe him much. We fought many battles together, side by side.
Nothing more.
Deny it all you want. I know love when I see it.
You're wrong.
Phillip.
Regina. Come on!
I know.
David!
Hurry!
It's not working.
Come on, you bastard!
No! Stay back!
Phillip, what are you doing?!
You know what I'm doing.
No, please. We can help you fight!
Go! It will find me.
I've been marked. It's too late for me.
Go! There's no other way.
Yes, there is. Give me the talisman.
I can mark myself. You can live.
This is my choice--to save you, to save both of you.
No, Phillip, I don't want to live without you!
Neither do I.
You two each keep each other safe!
Phillip, no!
I love you.
No! Phillip!
Phillip!
No! No! Phillip!
Phillip! Phillip!
It's not working!
What is the problem?
Magic.
It's different here.
Now would be the time!
It's coming!
Regina!
No!
No!
I'm not losing her again!
Neither am I!
This palace was to be our home.
We were to spend eternity here.
How did you end up here in your cursed state?
You're not the only one who knows about sacrifice.
You should have it.
Thank you.
Where are they?!
I have no idea.
Are they dead?
The curse-- it destroyed all the land.
Are they dead?!
I don't know.
I should've killed you myself.
Well, then what's stopping you?
You think you're some heroic prince?
Please. You're nothing but the son of a shepherd.
I should've killed you when I could,
and now...
now I can.
Mom?!
Henry, what are you doing here?
What are you doing?
It's okay.
You're safe now.
Where's my mom? Where's--
They're gone.
They fell through a portal. They're...
Henry, I'm sorry.
No, you're not.
You really are the evil queen.
I don't want to see you again.
No, don't say that.
I love you.
Then prove it.
Get Emma and Mary Margaret back, and until then,
leave me-- leave everyone alone.
Where will you go?
With me.
I, uh, went for a long walk.
I thought you didn't want to see me.
I didn't,
but I...was worried.
Well, the beast is gone.
Regina...
Lives.
So, uh, you didn't get what you wanted.
Well, that remains to be seen.
You, uh...
You still have it.
My chipped cup.
There are many, many things in this shop,
but this...
This is the only thing I truly cherish.
And now you must leave.
What?
You must leave, because despite what you hope,
I'm still a monster.
Don't you see?
That's exactly the reason I have to stay.
Henry.
Yeah?
Don't worry.
Emma and Mary Margaret-- they're alive.
How do you know?
I have faith.
But...
Henry, come here.
I will find them.
I will always find them.
We should leave this place. It's not safe here.
But the wraith is gone.
There's more.
You need to know everything.
Much has changed in our land since you've been asleep.
It was less than a year.
In a manner of speaking.
You see, as you slept,
and Phillip and I searched for you,
something worse happened.
What?
Are you familiar with Regina the queen?
Yes.
She cast a curse on this land--
A terrible, terrible curse.
It ripped everyone away to another world.
But we're still here.
This corner of the land was untouched.
No one knows why, but something saved us,
and for 28 years, we were frozen,
and then time started again.
The terrible curse's power was weakened.
Phillip and I were able to resume our search.
We found you.
But the land is ravaged
with dangers more fearsome than you can imagine.
For those of us who remain,
we found a safe haven.
We must go there now.
Something's in there.
Stay back.
What did it bring?
What is it? What do you see?
Mulan, what is that?
That...
That is what brought the wraith here.
