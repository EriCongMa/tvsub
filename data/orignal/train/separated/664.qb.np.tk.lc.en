第一季 第十五集
emily , this is my grandfather , edward grayson .
i know you were in love with amanda &apos;s father .
mom , what is he talking about ?
david clarke isn &apos;t just amanda &apos;s father .
he &apos;s your biological father as well .
i am suggesting that you step down as c.e.o. ,
and we groom your son to take your place .
as you were warned , revenge is a stony path .
fire &amp; ice .
was fire and brimstone not available ?
there comes a moment in each of our lives
when the control that keeps us sane slips through our fingers .
most of us aim to seize it back .
the best way to fight chaos
is with chaos .
why are we wasting time tearing apart
an empty motel room ?
there &apos;s nothing here .
amanda must have taken the box with her .
and left her phone behind ?
she &apos;s not the one who stole it , nolan .
emily ...
she didn &apos;t know where i kept the box .
and if she did , she wouldn &apos;t have done this to me .
she &apos;s too loyal .
who are you calling ?
we &apos;re about to find out .
speak of the devil .
or should i say the devil &apos;s daughter .
your father had excellent penmanship , by the way .
tyler .
i thought they locked you up .
more like put me up .
spring haven hospital for the criminally insane .
i can &apos;t believe this .
hey , nolan . how &apos;s the arm ?
what do you want , tyler ?
you know , i haven &apos;t decided yet .
money would be nice .
but then again , so would vindication .
how &apos;s danny ?
excited for the party tomorrow night ?
you &apos;ll never get close enough to find out .
i &apos;m crushed that you don &apos;t want me there .
stay by your phone .
oh , and if you do anything rash ,
like , uh , cancel the engagement party or call the cops ,
you can kiss your friend here good @-@ bye .
amanda ?
do me a favor .
next time you want to get a 17 @-@ year @-@ old girl drunk , don &apos;t do it here .
none of this would &apos;ve happened if you hadn &apos;t stuck your nose
where it didn &apos;t belong .
and for what , some crazy girl
you met for one summer a hundred years ago ?
she set a dude &apos;s house on fire , jack .
that guy deserved it .
and don &apos;t get me started on what the graysons deserve .
man , you &apos;re really losing it , you know that ?
sounds like your voice , jack ,
so i &apos;m guessing i got the right number .
this is father rick calling from port @-@ au @-@ prince .
last time we spoke ,
you were busy settling your dad &apos;s affairs .
i hope that all worked out as best it could .
i &apos;m calling because i received a hefty grant
to raise a grade school and thought ,
if you were still interested ,
you might want to head up the project .
if your plate &apos;s still full , fine .
but this is an opportunity to do some real good , son .
it &apos;d be great to have you down here .
who would you rather sit next to at the engagement party ,
the paulsons or the craigs ?
oh , we &apos;re fiddling while rome burns , are we ?
the paulsons .
the craigs it is then .
why are you still here , conrad ,
to gloat ?
you already destroyed any chance i had
at explaining myself to charlotte .
congratulations . you win .
oh , not exactly .
my father &apos;s threatened to oust me from the board
if you and i can &apos;t reach a quiet settlement .
you might have to answer to him , but i do not .
and if it takes bloodying you on wall street
to get what i &apos;m owed , so be it .
well , who the hell are you to play hardball
when your safety net just stormed out of the house tonight
looking none to eager to ever speak with you again ?
daniel will come back to me .
he always does .
there you are .
daniel .
what are you doing ?
waiting for you .
were you able to get ahold of charlotte ?
she &apos;s with declan .
she didn &apos;t want to talk . she sounded drunk .
oh , i &apos;m so sorry .
is that her ?
no .
your grandfather .
third one tonight .
daniel , he &apos;s grooming you
to become the next c.e.o. of grayson global .
that is huge .
i don &apos;t even want to go to the engagement party tomorrow night
let alone take over the family business .
it &apos;s a really big deal . you should at least just sit down
and hear what he has to say .
fine .
but can &apos;t we just cancel the damn party ?
trust me , nothing would make me happier .
but hundreds of people are traveling
hundreds of miles to be here .
you &apos;re right .
just promise me one more time ...
no secrets of any kind , ever .
you &apos;ve seen what they &apos;ve done to my family .
let &apos;s go to bed . it &apos;s late .
i &apos;m right behind you .
all right .
she &apos;s not who you think she is , you know ?
yeah , she &apos;s you .
and you &apos;re her .
and her ...
and her , and her .
and they call me crazy .
i mean , she &apos;s not a bad person .
she does stuff to people , but it &apos;s for the right reasons .
really ?
do you recognize this guy ?
mason treadwell .
victoria grayson planted
his interview tapes on me
so she could frame me for arson .
you mean the tapes that emily copied
and stashed away in her little box of secrets ?
victoria grayson didn &apos;t frame you . emily did .
that makes no sense .
why , because she &apos;s your soul mate ,
the sister you never had ?
yes .
mm . oh , look .
11 text messages on a phone
that i presume used to be yours
from one lovesick jack porter ,
none of which i &apos;m guessing ever found their way to you .
emily &apos;s not your friend , amanda .
she &apos;s your competition .
you need more proof ?
have at it .
charlotte , it &apos;s me .
your family has been calling nonstop .
you gotta face &apos; em eventually .
where &apos;s your mouthwash ?
uh , it &apos;s in the medicine cabinet .
listen , i @-@ i got the number here
of a therapist that my buddy went to
after his mom died .
well , unfortunately , mine &apos;s alive and well .
obviously , losing your mother and finding out
that your read dad is not really your dad
are two different things , but ... i don &apos;t know .
he said this lady was really helpful , so ...
i called the office , and they said
she had a slot for you this afternoon .
羟考酮止痛药 遵医嘱服用
charlotte ,
are you listening to me ?
give me the number .
southampton surveillance ?
it &apos;s nolan &apos;s security detail .
i figure , after everything that &apos;s happened this summer ,
it &apos;s better safe than sorry .
and you owe me a favor .
why ?
daniel wanted to cancel the party .
no , i &apos;d be ruined .
well , that &apos;s what i told him .
did he also tell you
how much it would break his mother &apos;s heart
or does it not matter to him anymore ?
why don &apos;t i let you two chat ,
and i can talk about this with you later ?
daniel is a fickle boy , emily .
he loves to sit on fences .
i hope when that fence is his opinion of his mother
that i can trust you to be my advocate .
well , you haven &apos;t made that very easy for me .
well , i realize you and i have had our disagreements ,
to say the very least .
but if you indeed plan on being part of this family ,
you need to know that ...
blood will always be thicker than water .
meaning ?
meaning that one day ,
you may or may not become daniel &apos;s wife ,
but i will always be his mother .
daniel feels betrayed by you .
if you want to rescue that relationship ,
you &apos;re going to have to earn back his trust .
would you facilitate that conversation ?
well , that &apos;s up to daniel .
excuse me .
this is emily .
is it ?
i thought you &apos;d like to know ,
that i &apos;ve decided revenge is a pitiful pursuit
and a waste of my fleeting time , so ...
let &apos;s make a straight @-@ up ransom deal .
you bring a cashier &apos;s check
to the south strand parking structure at noon ,
and i &apos;ll bring your little box of secrets .
what about amanda ?
after we &apos;re done , she &apos;s ...
all yours .
hello , grandpa .
thanks for coming . sit .
how &apos;s your sister doing ?
i bet her heart &apos;s in a million pieces right about now .
have you spoken with her ?
not yet , no .
but declan made an appointment for her to go see someone .
someone ?
yeah , a therapist over in bridgehampton .
oh , good for her .
so listen , i &apos;ve got a job for you .
see all of these names ?
these are the investors chirping the loudest
about that rumored s.e.c. investigation
and your father &apos;s marital woes .
see the name at the top of the list ?
satoshi takeda .
the good news is that he &apos;s here for your engagement party .
and he has requested a private meeting with you this afternoon .
so you &apos;re job is to convince him
to keep his money put .
you have a problem with that ?
your name &apos;s grayson , daniel .
the name makes the decision for you .
i accepted father rick &apos;s offer .
i set sail tonight , man .
man , this isn &apos;t about the fight we had earlier , right ?
because i said i &apos;m sorry , okay ?
dec , it &apos;s not about that at all .
i just--i just feel like my life has gone off track
and i gotta ...
i gotta get it back , man .
and i can &apos;t do that here . do you understand ?
yeah , i do . it &apos;s been a weird summer .
and you &apos;re nursing a heartache
and some broken ribs .
but , jack , haiti ?
it &apos;s not forever .
it &apos;s just a couple of months .
you &apos;ll be in school . bull can take care of the bar .
look ...
i won &apos;t go . if you don &apos;t think you &apos;ll be okay--
ah , jack , i &apos;m gonna be fine .
i &apos;m just gonna miss you .
charlotte .
so where are you off to in such a hurry , young lady ?
it wouldn &apos;t be to a therapist &apos;s office
in bridgehampton , now would it ?
who told you that ?
well , word gets around .
but look ,
i understand how popular it is these days
to kick back on a doctor &apos;s couch and purge your problems ,
but truth be known , more often than not ,
they cause more harm than good .
how ?
if you were tell a stranger
that your mother slept with a terrorist ,
and then that stranger decided to share that information ,
what do you think would happen to the family &apos;s reputation ?
when the grayson name loses value ,
so does the company .
are you willing to gamble away your future
for something like that ?
if it means not losing my mind , yeah .
well , what about declan &apos;s future ?
what about declan &apos;s future ?
i understand the kid flunked his entrance exam to collins prep .
no surprise , i guess , but ...
from the dean .
now i &apos;m willing to make a call on the young man &apos;s behalf ,
but , every quid deserves a quo .
you wouldn &apos;t happen to have that , uh ,
therapist &apos;s number on you , would you ?
miss emily , i thought we had an agreement--
hands against the fence , tyler .
yeah , okay , okay , okay .
where &apos;s my money ?
i &apos;ll let you know when i &apos;m satisfied
that everything &apos;s here .
where &apos;s amanda ?
she can tell you herself when i &apos;m satisfied
that you brought my money .
and the box ?
the box is in the trunk .
get amanda on the phone .
with pleasure .
you know , that amanda is one loyal customer .
even after everything i showed her
about how you played her for a fool ,
she still wouldn &apos;t believe me .
you must have really done a number on her head .
hey , mandy . uh , i got your b.f.f. here .
let me talk to her .
yeah , go for it .
she &apos;s actually right behind you .
who &apos;s the fool now ?
amanda , tyler is crazy .
i don &apos;t know what lies he &apos;s told you ,
but you need to listen to me--
no , you listen to me .
i &apos;ve sacrificed everything for you .
i gave you my name .
and what did you do ?
you took away the one thing in my entire life
that meant anything to me .
i had to protect jack from all of this .
i was talking about you and me .
are we , uh , done being cathartic over there ?
because we &apos;re wasting time .
amanda , don &apos;t do this .
good girl .
start the car .
the money .
i wired the funds into an account
at the canadian national bank .
you &apos;re gonna have to go there to get it .
put that over there .
perfect .
have fun at the party tonight .
i hear there &apos;s gonna be fireworks .
new gun ? that was fast .
so you &apos;re determined to turn this party into a funeral ?
i &apos;m determined to be prepared for anything .
you of all people should know
how unpredictable tyler can be .
well , then just cancel it , ems .
it &apos;s beyond that now .
you got a minute ?
one midnight call from a haitian benefactor ,
and bam , off you go ?
so when do you set sail ?
tonight .
i should &apos;ve left months ago , but , well ...
life gets in the way .
it does mean i won &apos;t be able to make it
to your party tonight .
of course , after that last graysons gathering ,
i don &apos;t think anyone &apos;s gonna miss me .
so no word from amanda then ?
maybe i &apos;m not supposed to hear from her .
maybe ...
building this school is the universe &apos;s way
of setting my priorities straight .
you know , amanda will come back when she &apos;s ready .
and when she does , i &apos;ll make sure
you &apos;re the first person she calls .
what about sammy ?
ah , well , that &apos;s actually why i &apos;m here .
it &apos;s a long trip ,
and he &apos;s not exactly a puppy anymore .
i don &apos;t know . the way he lights up when he &apos;s around you ,
i thought ...
i &apos;d be happy to .
you hear that , old man ?
emily &apos;s gonna take you in .
back to where it all began .
you be good now , you hear ?
bye , jack .
bye .
shut up .
bye .
go with him .
nolan--
i am serious .
sail away .
fall in love .
go make little volunteer babies .
you know i can &apos;t do that .
at the beginning of the summer ,
you said you wanted to help me .
if you meant it ,
you &apos;ll make sure he gets on that boat safely tonight .
emily .
please .
jack !
wait up !
sammy .
stay here .
stay here .
what is this ?
this is the deed to grayson manor .
and what about the shares of the company ?
i told you , they were a deal breaker .
i &apos;m not gonna relinquish grayson global , victoria ,
not to you and not to my father .
daniel is gonna have his time at the head of the table .
this is not that time .
settle now ,
and i &apos;m gonna see to it
that you get full cash value for all your shares .
well , at least tell me you &apos;re gonna think about it .
hey , where have you been ? you &apos;ve been gone all day .
come on .
about to step
into a meeting with our old friend takeda .
takeda ?
really ? he &apos;s back in town ?
and coming to the party . hey , let me ask you something .
these next couple of months , you have any commitments ?
just you . why ?
that &apos;s all i need to know .
i &apos;ll see you in a bit .
i &apos;m sorry i &apos;m late .
please .
actually , mr. takeda , i &apos;m-- i &apos;m not staying .
they sent me here to convince you
that grayson global is the place to be ...
but if i can &apos;t convince myself to stay ,
how can i convince you ?
he said , i &apos;m not sure i follow .
i &apos;m asking my fiancee to run away with me .
and if she says yes ,
we &apos;ll leave tomorrow .
this is a big decision .
very , and long overdue .
i &apos;ll make sure someone from the office contacts you
and answers any concerns you might have
about my family &apos;s company .
now if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
i have some travel plans to make .
how do i look ?
under medicated .
i can assure you , i &apos;m thinking quite clearly .
not as clearly as emily .
she &apos;s probably five steps ahead of you .
not this time .
i know why i want payback .
but why are you going through all this trouble to destroy her ?
why not go be a millionaire in canada ?
this was never about the money , mandy .
then what ?
does the name frank stevens mean anything to you ?
should it ?
he worked for the graysons .
emily bashed his skull in
and then planted his wallet in my pocket
for the cops to find .
you think emily killed that guy ?
isn &apos;t it obvious ?
why else would emily frame me for it
if not to distract attention from herself ?
so what , you &apos;re just gonna ...
kill emily ?
no .
emily &apos;s gonna kill daniel .
or at least that &apos;s how it will appear to the cops .
an eye for an eye .
now why don &apos;t you
get dressed ?
you &apos;ve earned yourself a front @-@ row seat .
daniel &apos;s about to find out
exactly how bad his taste in women really is .
hi . you okay ?
last @-@ minute adjustments to your speech ?
a long @-@ overdue adjustment to my life .
i called your lawyer
and i &apos;ve agreed to your terms .
i had her send over a messenger with the divorce papers .
you were right , conrad .
it &apos;s time to end this .
rather poetic timing , don &apos;t you think ?
see you at the party .
约翰 · 麦克高文 现场主管
you couldn &apos;t have picked a better time to invest , george .
grayson global &apos;s on track for the best quarter in history .
very impressive .
tick tock , cinderella .
time &apos;s a @-@ wasting .
suddenly you can &apos;t get to the party fast enough .
the faster we get there , the faster it &apos;ll be over .
and after it is , i have a surprise for you .
well , i have a surprise for you , too .
your mother asked me to facilitate a detente between you two .
i &apos;m sorry you got put in the middle of all this .
it &apos;s what i signed up for .
come on . we &apos;re late .
you don &apos;t like my taste in dresses ?
i &apos;m not going to the party .
don &apos;t worry . i won &apos;t get in your way .
i can &apos;t take that chance .
it &apos;s your choice .
there they are ,
the future mr. and mrs. grayson .
well , someone &apos;s in a good mood tonight .
i could say the same about you .
i &apos;m engaged to the girl of my dreams .
why wouldn &apos;t i be ?
well , if it isn &apos;t the guests of honor .
don &apos;t we look wonderful .
you got a minute to talk ?
of course , darling .
sweetheart , i know how upset you are
about the misunderstanding we had regarding charlotte .
you mean how you led me to believe
her real father raped you ?
i never said that .
and if i had any idea that you would ...
the truth is that i loved david clarke very much .
god , mom . just stop .
no , please . i need you to understand
how much he meant to me .
save your breath .
i &apos;m not interested in anything else you have to say to me .
after tonight , i &apos;m done with you .
i &apos;m taking emily to paris . we &apos;ll get married
and stay there until we choose the life we want to lead ,
one that doesn &apos;t involve grayson manor , grayson global ,
or anything grayson .
what does emily have to say about this ?
you haven &apos;t told her , have you ?
what makes you think that
she &apos;ll give up the grayson name
and everything that comes with it so easily ?
she &apos;s worked so hard for
the privilege in just three months .
what are you saying ?
i &apos;m saying that i know the type .
i was once just like her ,
ambitious , driven .
yes , by greed and insecurity .
emily is generous and decent . she &apos;s nothing like you .
well ...
we &apos;ll find out soon enough , won &apos;t we ?
but don &apos;t be surprised
if she doesn &apos;t give your romantic delusions
the warm response that you &apos;re hoping for .
i certainly won &apos;t be .
well ...
bon voyage , my friend .
sensei .
yes .
to guide your plan back to its righteous path .
a gift .
is this ...
how did you get it ?
your opponents are dangerous , but careless .
what happened to amanda and tyler ?
take the box .
bury your father &apos;s secrets away from here .
when you return ,
your questions will be answered .
jack !
jack , wait .
amanda ?
my god .
what are you doing here ?
what happened to you ?
i @-@ i @-@ i don &apos;t even know where to begin .
jack ...
i &apos;m so sorry .
where are you going ?
port @-@ au @-@ prince .
i &apos;m following through with a plan
i should &apos;ve stuck with a long time ago .
take me with you .
amanda ...
i have so many questions .
i know , and you deserve the answers , all of them .
take me with you ,
and i promise , i &apos;ll never leave you again .
hey .
hey .
what are you doing out here ?
just ... getting some air .
come to paris with me .
what ?
i @-@ i already bought the tickets . let &apos;s just go .
daniel , that &apos;s crazy .
the further away from my family we are ,
the more chance we have of doing this right .
i can &apos;t .
my life is here . our lives are here .
running away isn &apos;t the answer .
well , sometimes , it &apos;s the only answer .
there &apos;s nothing for me here but secrets and lies .
i &apos;m here .
and why is that exactly ?
what--why do you want to marry me , emily ?
because i love you .
then come away with me .
where is this coming from ?
d @-@ did your mother say something ?
yeah .
yeah , as a matter of fact , she did .
and you know what ?
she was right .
daniel , come back .
thanks , skipper .
nolan called me that .
he was kinda my , uh ,
my half gilligan , half professor .
nolan wasn &apos;t exactly fond of me .
no one in this town is .
except emily .
everyone told me to stay away from you
but her .
even as i was getting ready to take off , to sail away ,
she didn &apos;t tell me to give up on you .
just to follow my heart .
hopefully one day , you &apos;ll get to know her better .
i , um ...
i still owe-- owe the guy his fare .
sure . here .
hurry back .
i love you .
amanda ?
hurry . go . go !
amanda !
big ed .
will you hang on to this for me ?
okay , boss .
thanks .
emily .
i &apos;ve been looking everywhere for you .
where &apos;s daniel ?
he &apos;s walking the beach .
we &apos;re having a thing .
same thing or different thing ?
same thing .
nice night for it .
nice night for what , nolan ?
celebrating .
you shouldn &apos;t be here .
ah , that makes two of us .
ems ...
it &apos;s okay .
jack is gone .
she &apos;s not worth it .
hello , danny .
do you remember your birthday party
when i asked your father to tell me the truth
about david clarke ?
what &apos;s your point ?
i never got to finish the story .
i already know how it ends .
clarke slept with my mother .
charlotte &apos;s his daughter .
that &apos;s not the ending of the story , danny .
that &apos;s just the beginning .
here .
see for yourself .
what &apos;s this ?
why don &apos;t we call your fiancee and ask her ?
i did , after all ,
find it underneath her living room floorboards .
she &apos;s been playing you , brother .
she &apos;s playing all of us .
you know , on second thought ,
allow me to do the honors .
let &apos;s take a walk down to the shore .
shall we ?
charlotte .
is everything okay ?
couldn &apos;t be better .
i &apos;ve got it .
charlotte ?
charlotte .
oh , she &apos;ll come around .
my children always do .
thank you for the tete @-@ a @-@ tete with daniel .
i &apos;m glad it went well .
well , he told me about his secret plan
for the two of you .
and seeing as that you &apos;re not on a plane to paris ,
i can only assume that you talked some sense into the boy .
stay right here , won &apos;t you ?
and allow me to properly show you my gratitude .
hey , you really want out of that tux ?
yes .
i just dropped a young lady off
on further lane in southampton ,
amanda !
amanda !
no , no , no , no !
amanda !
oh , my god . what did you do ?
jack , i ...
i can &apos;t--i ...
i didn &apos;t--
go .
my truck &apos;s up the road . the keys are inside .
you have to go .
now .
where are we going ?
you ask too many questions .
show me what you got , bad boy .
here . i &apos;ll help you .
i got it . i got it .
okay . ready to go ?
yeah .
oh , come on .
keys .
fire and ice .
when we first sat down to discuss tonight &apos;s occasion ,
i was immediately taken by the idea
of an evening inspired by primal bookends--
fire and ice ,
beginnings and endings ,
and the love between a man and a woman .
yo , yo , 8 mile , private party here !
starry evening ...
that creepter not be taking pictures .
you got a problem ?
tonight not only marks the final weekend ...
of a truly remarkable summer in the hamptons ,
it is also the engagement of my son daniel
to the lovely and beguiling ms . emily thorne .
and though we &apos;ve only known emily for a few short months ,
we never even knew was missing .
in a word ...
i approve .
and as anyone can tell you ,
approval is not something i give away freely .
where the hell is my son ?
mom !
mom !
mom ! my brother ...
somebody come here !
come here !
daniel !
daniel !
chaos ...
by its very definition cannot be controlled .
hey .
my , uh , truck broke down .
is there a chance you can give me a ride ?
thank you .
it is an honor to be of service .
once introduced ,
all order and intention is rendered useless .
daniel !
daniel !
get away from my son !
daniel !
daniel , baby , please .
daniel , w @-@ wake up . please .
baby , please !
daniel !
it &apos;s tyler . oh , my god .
mom ?
the outcome of chaos can never be predicted .
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
the only certainty it brings ...
i ...
don &apos;t say a word .
