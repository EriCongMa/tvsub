you actually insult people
and then expect them to give you money ?
that &apos;s how it works with you and me .

everyone &apos;s loving our new cupcake t @-@ shirts .
i &apos;ve sold four in the last hour .

because i want everything to be perfect on my big day .
our big day .

i can &apos;t believe this .
they &apos;re getting married and i don &apos;t have a wedding donkey
anywhere on my horizon .
omg , you sell these t @-@ shirts ?
i just bought one .
did i jut sell you that shirt and already forgot ?
i knew that nine @-@ cent deodorant
was going to give me brain lesions .
well , the label did have a picture of a brain
with &quot; no bueno &quot; written on it .
no , i bought it at a store in manhattan
on east ninth and broadway .
i know because i &apos;m ocd and it was 67 steps
and 14 sidewalk cracks from the corner .
max , someone else is selling our shirts .
i know .
we &apos;re getting hosed by some other hoes .
i can &apos;t believe they stole our shirt .
the one thing we made that people actually wanted to buy .
i feel like myspace .
i haven &apos;t seen anything this upsetting in a window
since that time i accidentally caught a reflection
of myself in my waitress uniform .
we need to talk to someone
about those damn shirts you jacked .
we about to rumble .
what she means is , we wish to speak to someone
about the adorable cupcake t @-@ shirts in the window .
or , we will be about to rumble .
i &apos;m just working here till i get my phd
in the eco @-@ social dynamics of western civilization .
so , forever ?
those t @-@ shirts are our design
and we need to know why they &apos;re here
and who knocked them off .
it &apos;s the granddaughter of the woman who owns this shop .
she &apos;s kind of a monster and she &apos;s walking in right now .
hi , kemberly and ashlin .
these ladies are interested in your t @-@ shirts .
aren &apos;t they cute ?
so cute .
yeah , super cute .
we designed them .
yeah , we designed them .
what ?
yeah , what ?
ashlin and kimberly , is it ?
it &apos;s kemberly , with an &quot; e. &quot;
i changed it myself &apos; cause i &apos;m original .
yeah , she &apos;s an original .
you know what &apos;s not original ?
those shirts . you stole them from us .
we did not steal your idea .
yeah , we did not steal your idea .
we copied it from this lame cupcake shop in brooklyn .
wait a minute ...
we have a lame cupcake shop in brooklyn .
ashlin , you talk too much .
this is why everyone knows about my lap @-@ band .
i think they know about it
because you lost 200 pounds over spring break .
it &apos;s hard to believe she was once twice this obnoxious .
if you don &apos;t stop selling our t @-@ shirts ,
we &apos;re gonna have to get our lawyer involved .
yeah , we &apos;re gonna have to get our lawyer involved .
and he &apos;s gonna kill you .
i don &apos;t know what lawyers do .
we &apos;re totally not doing this for us .
we &apos;re rich .
yeah , we &apos;re rich .
a percentage of every shirt that we sell goes to charity .
yeah , it goes to charity .
we are the charity that it needs to go to .
you &apos;re old and desperate for money .
and i totally get it .
my aunt &apos;s one of the real housewives of new york .
but , sorry .
it &apos;s the one without the leg .
what just happened here ?
that girl just called you old .
earl , i don &apos;t think i &apos;m going to be buying you that pinky ring
you wanted any time soon .
no rush max , you got plenty of time .
i got like , six or seven months before i turn to dust .
it &apos;s &apos; cause our t @-@ shirts got ripped off
by a couple of prep school girls in manhattan .
it &apos;s like a bad 80 &apos;s movie .
i don &apos;t know whether to date james spader
or teach this town how to dance .
this is so unfair .
those girls can &apos;t just steal from us .
this isn &apos;t 7 @-@ eleven .
max , i can &apos;t believe your naivet .
what does my body spray have to do with anything ?
look , there is no reason to be so upset about those two girls .
they &apos;re not going to affect our business .
plus , they have to live with themselves .
and karma is a bitch .
i mean , i littered once and look what happened to me .
hey , everybody .
i &apos;m up to my nuts in bridal junk .
there she is .
the love of my life .
the yin to my yang .
the zing to my wang .
save that gold for the vows .
i am svetlana , oleg &apos;s cousin .
well , darling , it could be worse .
you could be his sister .
svetty !
and you must be sophie .
yeah .
no .
but you haven &apos;t even heard any ideas .
caroline .
sophie , why did you just say my name ?
oh , it &apos;s oleg &apos;s and my safe word .
yeah . it means no .
it &apos;s the one word we both agreed we would never say during sex .
are you sure ?
because i give free oil change with every wedding .
caroline .
all right , well , i &apos;ll be in my booth .
you know , this wedding planner thing is
as crappy as the movie of the same name .

girls , i forgot to tell you ,
a man came by today with this letter for you .
this reminds me of when i was a young , hot @-@ shot courier .
i was a young , hot @-@ shot courier once , too .
i used to deliver drugs to my mother at work on my tricycle .
oh , my god , max , you &apos;re not gonna believe this ,
but those two girls have issued a cease and desist order .
those bitches .
what &apos;s that ?
they &apos;re saying we have to stop selling our t @-@ shirts .
that &apos;s what i told them we were going to do .
they even copied this idea .
we need to get a lawyer .
how ? we can &apos;t even afford law &amp; order on itunes .
hey , do you think we could afford that lawyer
on the subway billboards ?
the one who has a gavel in one hand and a chicken in the other ?
i think he just does acidentes .
what is going on here ?
there &apos;s food waiting in the window ,
periodicals strewn about .
someone &apos;s on his periodical .
han , we just got served .
at least someone in the diner has .
you &apos;re lucky your boss is so chill .
of course you &apos;re chill , you &apos;re one of mr. popper &apos;s penguins .
由儿童书改编 讲述波普先生与他六只企鹅的故事
how about this ?
we &apos;ll do the jobs you already pay us for
if you agree to pretend to be our lawyer .
you have a suit , right ?
why would i pretend to be a lawyer ?
you can &apos;t even pretend to be waitresses .
no one &apos;s gonna believe han &apos;s our lawyer , anyway .
he can &apos;t pass the bar , he can barely see over one .
that &apos;s it ! i &apos;ve had it with you two and your non @-@ work ethic .
and this area is for customers .
i want these out of here !
max ?
i suppose i could dig up a suit if that could , somehow ,
make this boss striking his employee thing go away .
max , of course these girls go to dalby hall ,
all my archenemies did .
i guess lady gaga won in the end , though .
in other news , i kind of like this eye @-@ patch .
i know you do , you were pretending to be
the pirate queen of the subway .
well , no one arrrrrgued with us .
how long did the eye doctor say you have to keep it on ?
and by eye doctor , i mean that first @-@ year med student
we gave the free dessert to .
a few days , which is a bummer ,
&apos;cause only seeing half of how sad we are
is kind of a blessing .
how are we gonna find them ?
follow the scent of our decaying t @-@ shirts business ?
according to instagram , they &apos;re in the cafeteria , see ?
ashlin just posted a pic of a mini @-@ pizza .
# thatpizzalife
they have mini @-@ pizzas here ?
my high school didn &apos;t even have heat .
sorry i &apos;m late .
i had to pick up a suit at the men &apos;s warehouse .
don &apos;t you mean the not quite a man &apos;s warehouse ?
han , i love your lawyer costume . so authentic .
only thing missing is the hole where your soul should be .
well , as i always say , if you &apos;re going to do something--
do it with your left hand so it will feel like someone else ?
no , if you &apos;re going to do something , do it right .
last halloween , i went as sprout from the green giant commercial
其广告形象是一个身裹树叶的绿色巨人
and i even put pea pods over my pee @-@ pee .
you laugh , but i won $ 500 .
okay , i created my own cease and desist order .
where did you get this ?
same place max printed out that fake ,
&quot; i don &apos;t have herpes &quot; doctor certificate .
it works .
and here &apos;s your business card .
where ? where is it ?
i can &apos;t see .
here .
and han , i hope you &apos;re a better actor than max .
dwayne &quot; the rock &quot; johnson is a better actor than max .

mr. lu su ?
that &apos;s what you came up with ?
mr. lu su ?
well , you &apos;re a lawyer , so the &quot; su &quot; part is totally on point .
but lu su ?
no asian was ever named that .
maybe not in this galaxy ,
but might i remind you of a mr. sulu .
oh , yeah . i mixed it up . genius !
han , you don &apos;t have to use the cards .
i can make it work .
two halloweens ago , i was an ewok
and turned an orange bath @-@ towel into a turban .
second place . $ 250 .
and next halloween , you can wear that
and goes as a lesbian minister .
okay , so the plan is , we go in there
and calmly confront them with our attorney .
i &apos;ll do the talking .
han , you stand there and try to look smart .
ah . i &apos;m already asian . so , done .
wow , this brings me back .
i had a seat at the popular table ,
the debate team table , the student council table ,
and the waiting for marriage table .
but that table kind of fell apart
when everybody got pregnant but me .
i ate in the school parking lot with a wino .
he was so nice to me , i thought he might be my dad .
but then he never made a move on me ,
so i guess he wasn &apos;t .
attention everyone , attention .
yeah , attention everyone , attention .
ashlin and i are here today to sell our t @-@ shirts
and to talk about bullying
and how it &apos;s not cool .
it &apos;s so not cool .
i was talking , ash .
yeah , she was talking .
their charity is bullying ?
that &apos;s like kanye west trying to raise money for laying low .
老婆是金 · 卡戴珊 两人基本生活在聚光灯下
a $ 3 donation will be made to our anti @-@ bullying fund
with each purchase of one of our super , super cute tees .
super , super cute tees .
my super cute tee !
best idea i ever had .
right up there with the bong with a chin strap
so you could be hands @-@ free to change the channel .
so buy a shirt right now and then we &apos;ll be back later
for the rest of the anti @-@ bully talk .
yeah , buy them or my dad won &apos;t pay
for the lacrosse equipment this year .
let &apos;s go .
they are making a fortune on us .
and if i &apos;m gonna get screwed , it better be by someone over 21
yeah , that sounds like a job with a two drink minimum .
han , don &apos;t mess this up or you &apos;ll be eating those glasses .
might i interest you in an anti @-@ bullying pamphlet ?
might i interest you in a seat on my finger ?
hey , how did you two get in here ?
the school pays guards out front to keep out the homeless .
yeah , well , jokes on you .
&apos;cause they just let us walk in .
hello , girls . you can &quot; cease and desist &quot;
selling our t @-@ shirts as of now .
this is our attorney , mr ....
lu su .
and he is holding our cease and desist
to counter your cease and desist .
okay , well , first , your lawyer
looks like a teacher on a disney show .
is that a bad thing ?
and if you have anything further to say ,
you can take it up with my lawyer . her dad .
and he &apos;s real good .
he got that ceo guy who admitted he killed his whole family
out on a technicality .
i forgot how mean girls can be .
how ? i &apos;m your roommate .
thank you , kemberly . thank you , ashlin .
a little help .
hello , girls , you all look very nice .
what is he doing ?
hopefully a tight ten and then he &apos;ll bring up the headliner .
this may be hard to believe , looking at me
in this totally awesome suit ,
but i know a little something about being bullied .
as a little child--
and as a slightly bigger adult .
seriously ?
in the middle of his bullying speech , your bullying ?
kind of surprised even myself .
i have someone who bullies me .
okay , let &apos;s get out of here while i can .
it &apos;s not just the hitting and the name @-@ calling .
although , not gonna lie , that &apos;s a real bummer .
you see , girls , the bad thing about being bullied
is that every time it happens ,
it steals a little piece of who you are .
and then , if it happens enough , little by little ,
you become just a little less of who you were meant to be .
and that &apos;s not cool .
and these two girls up here , without knowing it , i &apos;m sure ,
stole a little piece of max and caroline .
when they stole their little idea .
and that &apos;s so not cool .
yeah , that &apos;s so not cool .
max , caroline , we &apos;ll stop making the shirts .
ash , i never said that .
ah , no , kemberly . i did .
and i liked you more before the lap @-@ band .
when you were still kimberly with an &quot; i. &quot;
max , did han just save us ?
i wasn &apos;t listening , i was putting mini @-@ pizzas in my pocket .
girls , your shift started 40 minutes ago .
what are you doing here so early ?
earl , good news . we are now the sole owners
of all those cupcake t @-@ shirts .
and , literally , nothing else .
maybe i could rent a parrot
and pick up some shifts at long john silver &apos;s .
断腿海盗long john silver 其肩上有一只鹦鹉
hey , girls .
i &apos;m about to meet another wedding planner .
and this one &apos;s gonna be good !
he &apos;s gay .
sophie kuchenski ?
yes , god !
from the second i walked in here , i said to myself ,
&quot; that has to be her . &quot; and i can see it .
we &apos;re going to make magic together .
yeah , what &apos;s gay for no ?
okay .
wow , i think we just survived a &quot; torgaydo . &quot;
where am i gonna find another gay wedding planner
in new york now ?
just throw a tantrum in a crate &amp; barrel ,
and five of them will come running .
hey , nice legal work today .
you should be on the little people &apos;s court .
yeah , from now on , i &apos;m calling you &quot; hanny cochran . &quot;
okay . next time you want to thank me ,
just send me an edible arrangement .
i don &apos;t know many times i have to drop that hint .
but that &apos;s just , like , a two @-@ inch drop .
sorry . i can &apos;t help myself .
but i &apos;m going to try because i know i was the bully
you were talking about in that speech .
what ? i was talking about the doorwoman in my building .
i have to submit to a purple @-@ nurple just to get my mail .
there &apos;s another woman ?
max , i think han has a side bully .
well , i &apos;ll just have to try harder .
because if anyone is gonna mercilessly nurple you
into an early grave , it &apos;s got to be me .
i &apos;d like to think so , max .
you &apos;d also like to ride in a car facing forwards .
back to normal .
