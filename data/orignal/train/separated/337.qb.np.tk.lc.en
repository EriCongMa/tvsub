hey , earl .
you girls are back from hollywood already ?
time sure does move fast .
we haven &apos;t left yet .
time sure does move slow ,
especially when you are as high as i am right now .
there &apos;s a car waiting out front to take us to the airport .
the only thing better than a town car
is a getting @-@ out @-@ of @-@ town car .
and i came in to say
there &apos;s a car waiting for me out front ,
and it &apos;s not a police car !
i knew you two weren &apos;t going to la .
i knew you were just pulling my chain .
you know , when i pull your chain ,
you go , &quot; whoo @-@ hoo @-@ hoo . &quot;
no studio would fly you two cross @-@ country
just to discuss a movie about caroline losing all her money .
that &apos;s almost as funny as that time caroline said
she reported the diner to the health department .
which reminds me , han , there &apos;s something here for you
from the health department .
han , we really are going to la .
in fact , they &apos;re already talking to the keebler elf
about playing you in my movie .
it &apos;s between him and the asian daughter from &quot; modern family . &quot;
this is almost as funny as that time max said
she registered me as a sex offender down at city hall .
han , there &apos;s also something here for you from city hall .
girls , what happened ?
are you on the no @-@ fly list too ?
you hide a six @-@ pack of batteries in your junk once ,
and you &apos;re grounded for life .
let &apos;s just go and never look back .
oh , my god .
this can &apos;t be our room .
this is so sweet .
is that why they call it that ?
terrace ! terrace !
staircase ! staircase !
oh , my god .
take a picture before they realize there &apos;s been a mistake
and put me back in coach .
these are the only 12 steps anyone &apos;s gonna get me to take .
now me . now me . terrace . terrace .
the view .
oh , i need to get a picture of me with the view .
this is so awesome .
our view at home is just a painting of a view
in the neighbor &apos;s apartment .
oops , careful of that railing .
three out @-@ of @-@ work actresses &quot; slipped and fell &quot;
from there last pilot season .
one fall is an accident , three an epidemic .
ooh , look . we each get a pet .
well , i &apos;m lawrence , the hotel &apos;s general manager .
i upgraded you .
you were supposed to be in a room with two queens ...
well , three if i was in it .
thank you so much , lawrence .
that &apos;s really amazing of you .
but why would you upgrade us ?
are you nuts ?
that &apos;s like asking a teacher if there &apos;s weekend homework .
well , i heard you were in la for a movie meeting ,
and , well , keep me in mind .
absolutely .
for what ?
a part .
i &apos;m also an actor .
i &apos;m very versatile .
i can play a gay dad , a gay executive ,
a gay priest .
is there any other kind ?
i can also play straight .
just ask my ex @-@ wife beth .
but she really should have suspected .
we would get into such knockdowns about the pesto .
lawrence , i &apos;m confused .
about what ?
gay guys care a lot about pesto .
aren &apos;t you the hotel &apos;s general manager ?
yep , for the last 20 years ,
until i get my big break .
so keep me in mind .
also , ms. black , your luggage is still lost ,
like me in my early f ... thirties .
enjoy the place . it &apos;s all yours .
this is lawrence .
the place is all ours !
the place is all ours !
hi . you have to get out ...
for about an hour .
go eat . it &apos;s almost dinnertime .
i &apos;ll put your name on the list at our restaurant .
and i &apos;m sorry about this .
it &apos;s just that i have an a @-@ list movie star
who wants to have an &quot; impromptu private meeting &quot; here .
is this like a travolta masseuse kind of thing ?
i said &quot; a @-@ list . &quot;
lawrence said we were on a list ,
so why are we still stuck out here ?
and don &apos;t blame my smelly shirt ,
because johnny depp , who &apos;s sitting over there ,
smells way worse .
why are you two still at the bar ?
didn &apos;t you speak to claude ?
which snotty gay guy is he ?
look , not everyone in this hotel is gay .
but claude is hands @-@ down @-@ my @-@ pants
the gayest .
i also came to apologize for asking you for a part ...
without showing you my reel .
come with me .
the wi @-@ fi &apos;s better by that fountain
that whoopi goldberg peed in .
i &apos;ll be right back , max
i have a feeling his reel is real short .
ooh , claude ? are you claude ?
i &apos;m sorry you had to be a baby named claude .
i &apos;m on the list .
name ?
max black .
no .
yes , max black .
uh , no .
yep , that &apos;s me , caroline channing .
i &apos;m with her . we &apos;re here together .
no .
dude , don &apos;t make me hit you .
max .
max black . max , over here .
claude , she &apos;s with me .
very good .
just so you know , i &apos;m not a hooker .
oh , i know .
prostitutes don &apos;t have such a tough time
getting past the maitre d &apos; here .
i &apos;m randy .
sit ?
and what makes you think i would need to hire
a hooker to have dinner with ?
oh , i didn &apos;t think you were a john .
i thought you were a pimp .
not a pimp .
uh , not buying it .
who else would wear five silver rings ?
every straight guy in la over 40 ?
wow , not a pimp , not gay .
you &apos;re really putting it all right out there .
you have to be from new york .
no , brooklyn ,
new york city &apos;s trashy little cousin with hep c.
wow , hooker , hep c.
you &apos;re really putting it all out there .
can i buy you a drink ?
a house ?
there you are .
hi . i &apos;m caroline . i &apos;m ...
leaving .
what ?
go . i just got bumped up to first .
livin &apos; in la and lovin &apos; my life .
hi , sophie . how are you ?
oh , not too good .
yeah , i thought i called max &apos;s phone .
is that the adoption agency ?
did you tell them we liked that couple
who didn &apos;t plan on a 14th ?
no , it &apos;s not the agency .
i called to talk to max , but i got caroline &apos;s
&quot; my life doesn &apos;t suck anymore &quot; podcast .
well , sophie , max isn &apos;t here .
she met this really cute guy ...
max already got laid !
that &apos;s why i love la .
hey , way back in the day , i was all up and down the strip .
now i &apos;m excited if i get up and down the step .
sophie , max didn &apos;t come home last night ,
but we don &apos;t know that she got laid .
oh , she did ...
by a lawyer .
and the verdict is in : hot .
hey , max , how hung was his jury ?
sophie , i have to go .
we have a meeting at the movie studio .
call you later , max .
i want details .
helmet or turtleneck ?
oh , my god . i &apos;m exhausted .
from all the sex ?
no , we went on a hike this morning .
la hookups are so healthy .
you exercised ? outside ?
oh , you must really like this guy .
well , i &apos;ve never had sex with a lawyer
that wasn &apos;t court @-@ appointed .
i &apos;m so happy for you .
and he &apos;s a lawyer ?
what , like , an entertainment lawyer ?
yep , he handles bradley cooper , nicole kidman ,
george clooney , and ... my clooney .
morning . got news about your luggage .
it &apos;s here ?
no .
like a young me , it &apos;s stuck in detroit .
perry tyler &apos;s office . this is quan .
oh , hi .
yes , absolutely , set in stone .
we &apos;re so excited .
so not happening .
but our meeting with mr. tyler
that was scheduled for 20 minutes ago ,
that &apos;s still happening , right ?
absolutely . set in stone . we &apos;re so excited .
ooh , i got a text .
no , it &apos;s me .
max , i can &apos;t believe it .
you &apos;re hoping the lawyer calls .
i &apos;ve never seen you hope for anything .
i thought he &apos;d call .
i kind of liked him .
i went outside in the daytime .
nina &apos;s on her way in .
you know , she &apos;s the executive who discovered me
at that storytelling show .
i &apos;m running behind , so you need to order me lunch .
i want a kale salad with a side of kale
and a kale shake ,
and tomorrow better book me a kale @-@ onic .
caroline , what are you doing ?
you &apos;re dressed all wrong .
yours is a &quot; riches to rags &quot; story ,
a story we &apos;ll never sell if you go in there wearing that .
i have a huge hole near the crotch
in my panty hose , if that helps .
it doesn &apos;t .
you need to look broke , busted ,
discarded from society .
put on what she &apos;s wearing .
fine ,
as long as i don &apos;t have to wear that stupid nurse cape .
that dress looks cute on you ,
all three of you .
i know . ugh , look at this .
it &apos;s like my first day of kindergarten .
hi .
it &apos;s been two hours . is he maybe ready yet ?
absolutely . we &apos;re so excited .
fine , but these are about to blow .
so don &apos;t come crying to me when you &apos;re blinded
by boob buttons .
something in your shirt is itching me .
why is there a joint in your shirt ?
i think that &apos;s obvious .
it fell down from my hair .
good thing you found it and not those tsa party poopers .
my phone . where ? where it it ?
oh , i put it here in your front pocket .
oh , cool , there &apos;s never room there when i wear it .
see , max , i knew he &apos;d call you .
well , he said he would .
and he will .
but right now , this is sophie .
hi , sophie .
how &apos;s the adoption going ?
did you find a 16 @-@ year @-@ old who really let her parents down ?
hey , earl , where is oleg right now ?
he just went to the men &apos;s room
with the bra ads from today &apos;s paper .
okay , i have 45 minutes .
but the thing is ,
i still want the baby to look like me .
well you can put hair extensions on anything .
are you saying that i shouldn &apos;t adopt
and i should keep trying to have my own baby ?
ohh , i &apos;ve got go sophie , our 4 : 00.2 : 00 meeting is on .
that &apos;s a wrap for today , quan .
wait , he &apos;s just gonna leave
and not acknowledge our existence ?
i can &apos;t believe this .
they &apos;re treating me like they know who i am .
mr. tyler .
hi , caroline channing .
we were supposed to have a meeting .
quick refresher : lost my billions
but not my plucky can @-@ do attitude against all odds .
i &apos;m max . i &apos;m the odds .
oh , yeah , you &apos;re the sad , dejected , destitute girl .
that &apos;s me , the destitute girl .
so sorry . today got away from me .
ryan murphy can talk .
i &apos;ll have my office call you tomorrow .
call her ?
call her ?
why don &apos;t you just tell her the truth ,
that she &apos;s never gonna hear from you ,
the movie &apos;s never gonna happen ,
and like every other man in this town ,
you &apos;re full of crap and silver jewelry .
well , okay then .
so sorry to have kept you waiting .
quan , set them up with another appointment tomorrow .
and this is platinum .
he &apos;s really gonna meet with us , right ?
absolutely . set in stone . we &apos;re so excited .
so never gonna happen .
what do we do now ?
well , as i said on my first day of kindergarten ...
it &apos;s recess .
there you are .
drinking alone at a bar in the morning .
did we switch bodies when we switched clothes ?
it &apos;s 5 : 00 somewhere .
oh , my god . maybe we have .
i just needed a few sips to calm myself down .
look , i &apos;m really sorry i lost it on that studio guy .
and i guess running behind his car and begging didn &apos;t work .
wow , even apologizing in la is healthy .
there &apos;s still a chance ; nina &apos;s meeting with perry right now .
maybe she &apos;ll smooth everything over ,
like everybody does here with their faces .
oh , claude , hi , caroline channing .
lawrence put me on the list for a table .
and i &apos;m max black , your worst nightmare .
one moment .
so aggressive . what is the problem ?
i &apos;m guessing low self @-@ esteem .
not him . i &apos;m talking about you .
i &apos;m guessing low self @-@ esteem .
nina , hi .
i didn &apos;t realize your meeting with perry was here .
god , it &apos;s like everyone in hollywood is here .
yes , for about another month .
then this place will be as empty
as keira knightley &apos;s refrigerator .
骨瘦如柴 不断被媒体影射患有厌食症
so i just talked to perry , and looks like
he was really offended by you yesterday .
uh , i &apos;m sure people have said worse things to that man .
i mean , his license plate says , &quot; makin &apos; movies . &quot;
max , you can &apos;t have an attitude like that
and not get buried in hollywood .
nina .
just ask claude .
he used to run paramount .
it &apos;s over ?
i came all this way to be disappointed
by a rich guy in hollywood ?
i could have just seen a kevin hart movie .
i &apos;m sorry .
i better go sign for these drinks while they &apos;re still free .
claude , claude , listen ,
i know you and i haven &apos;t gotten along ,
but quick fave .
i need to fix something for my friend .
can i just go over there and talk to that guy , please ?
are you on the list ?
i &apos;ve never been on the list .
i can do this all day , sweetheart .
i &apos;m a gay rumba champion .
hi , i &apos;m max . i &apos;ll be your server .
today &apos;s soup is &quot; please don &apos;t ruin my friend caroline &apos;s chance ,
it &apos;s all my fault . &quot;
and , of course , it &apos;s vegan , no dairy .
what &apos;s going on here ?
sir , i really screwed up ,
and as i screamed into your muffler yesterday ,
i am here to beg your forgiveness .
i wasn &apos;t talking about you .
i meant , why is there bread on my table ?
give her another chance .
this is the first good thing to happen to her
since she lost all her money ,
aside from the time the red cross gave us coffee .
at least meet with her ,
so you can hear how amazing her story is .
it &apos;s a story of someone not being defined
by all the bad things that have happened to them in the past
and just moving on .
i &apos;d buy a ticket to that .
perry , what &apos;s happening here ?
why is there bread on your table ?
this girl keeps trying to convince me
to have a meeting with her friend .
i haven &apos;t seen a waitress this desperate
since shannen doherty slipped me her head shot last night .
well , as your lawyer ,
i recommend you give her exactly what she wants .
you won &apos;t be sorry .
i wasn &apos;t .
come back tomorrow at 11 : 00 .
you guys may have to wait , but i &apos;ll squeeze you in .
oh , my ... thank you so much .
now , i have to go find my friend
before she accidentally slips and falls off the terrace .
max , hold up .
that was really cool of you .
i &apos;m not even upset anymore that you didn &apos;t call me .
i didn &apos;t want to come on too strong .
should i not have taken dating advice from david spade ?
ooh , i got to take this .
of course you do .
hello ?
hey , it &apos;s me .
can i see you tonight ?
did you get that from david spade ?
that &apos;s all stamos , baby .
and you &apos;re sure it &apos;s not another fake meeting ?
because quan called me to confirm ,
and that makes me nervous .
randy says the meeting &apos;s legit .
and turns out
you may have an la bf .
um , he is not my bf .
because b stands for &quot; boy , &quot;
and that guy is a ma @-@ an .
good news about your luggage .
like a young me ,
it arrived in los angeles in one piece ...
with a few holes in it .
this is you , right ?
sure looks like me .
max , you packed your waitress uniform ?
the weird thing is , i didn &apos;t .
i guess i &apos;m never getting away from that life .
yes , you will . we &apos;re in hollywood .
anything can happen .
oh , lawrence , how did your audition go ?
i didn &apos;t get it .
oh , well , maybe it wasn &apos;t the right role for you .
what was it ?
the filipino gay general manager of a hotel
who used to be straight .
next one . you &apos;ll get the next one .
well , now that your movie &apos;s back on , keep me in mind .
i really am a good actor .
like right now , i &apos;m acting like i &apos;m not depressed .
let &apos;s go out .
let &apos;s do hollywood stuff .
let &apos;s go to the observatory or see where biggie got murdered .
okay !
let me just grab something to wear .
oh , my god . i hope that isn &apos;t lawrence
saying that he needs the place for an hour
because ben affleck is here with a nanny ...
jude law is here with a nanny ...
gavin rossdale is here with a nanny .
hi , girls .
hey , we &apos;ve got a lady that looks like you at home .
wow , nice room .
sophie , what are you doing here ?
well , after max talked me into not adopting ...
i did ?
you did .
well , i did a little research on my barnes and noble nook .
do you want one ?
i guess they &apos;re just giving them away right now .
no , thanks .
i prefer to lie about the books i &apos;ve read
the old @-@ fashioned way .
well , it turns out all of these hollywood actresses
that are having babies over 40 , like geena davis ,
jane seymour , neil patrick harris ,
well , they &apos;re all going to this big @-@ shot healer out here ,
so here i am .
it &apos;s cool if i stay with you , right ?
absolutely .
set in stone .
we &apos;re so excited .
