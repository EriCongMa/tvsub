you know who &apos;s gonna be the bravest person in the marvel universe ?
whoever has to give she @-@ hulk a bikini wax .
you want to talk brave ,
how about captain america &apos;s undocumented mexican gardener ?
he &apos;s not braver than whoever uses the bathroom after the thing ?
as usual , you &apos;re all wrong .
the bravest person in the marvel universe
is the doctor who gives wolverine his prostate exam .
how about the guy who gets a prostate exam from wolverine ?
now you &apos;re just being silly .
wolverine &apos;s never displayed
the slightest interest in helping others
prevent prostate cancer .
hello .
yes , the elevator &apos;s out of order ;
you &apos;ll have to use the stairs .
of course you can .
pizza dates back to the 16th century ,
while the first elevator was not installed until 1852 .
that means that for over 300 years ,
people carried pizzas up stairs .
be part of that proud tradition .
i &apos;ll go get penny while that guy spits on our food .
do you think they gave wolverine an adamantium prostate ?
that &apos;s a stupid question .
we &apos;re having a conversation about probing the heinie of superheroes .
there are no stupid questions .
yes ?
oh , um , is penny here ?
you &apos;re leonard , right ?
yeah .
damn , it &apos;s good to finally meet you , son .
okay , i think a bit of context here might help .
oh , hey , leonard . i see you met my dad .
oh , good .
context .
come on in , buddy .
take a load off .
oh , gee , dad , leonard can &apos;t stay .
he just dropped by to say hello .
thanks for stopping by , sweetie .
i &apos;ll see you later .
bye .
that was odd .
are you sure you have enough comics ?
you &apos;re going to be monitoring the telescope for 12 hours ,
and by my estimate , you &apos;ve only selected
seven hours of reading material .
that &apos;s even factoring in
your difficulty in parsing american comic book idioms
like &quot; bamf ! &quot; and &quot; snikt ! &quot;
is that racist ?
it feels racist .
don &apos;t be oversensitive .
he &apos;s calling you illiterate , not your race .
oh , okay . good .
i don &apos;t need more comics .
howard &apos;s gonna stop by , we &apos;re gonna play
intergalactic battleship and indian monopoly .
i don &apos;t care for novelty editions of monopoly .
i prefer the classics : regular and klingon .
actually , indian monopoly &apos;s
just like regular , except the money &apos;s in rupees ,
instead of hotels you build call centers ,
and when you pick a chance card , you might die of dysentery .
just fyi ,
that was racist .
you &apos;ll never guess what just happened .
you went out in the hallway ,
stumbled into an interdimensional portal
which brought you 5,000 years into the future ,
where you took advantage of the advanced technology
to build a time machine , and now you &apos;re back
to bring us all with you to the year 7010
where we are transported to work at the thinkatorium
by telepathically controlled flying dolphins ?
no .
penny kissed me .
well , who would ever guess that ?
what @-@ what kind of a kiss ?
a big kiss . on the mouth .
is it possible that she was going for your cheek
and you moved and she accidentally got lip ?
that happens with me and my mom all the time .
she introduced me to her father ,
kissed me and then shut the door in my face .
maybe she was trying to send you a message .
you think ?
yeah . &quot; this man is not my father .
i &apos;m being held hostage .
so i &apos;m going to do
something insane in the hopes
that you &apos;ll call 911 . &quot;
penny kissing me is not insane .
she used to kiss me all the time .
einstein defined insanity as &quot; doing the same thing
over and over again and expecting different results . &quot;
by that standard ,
penny is cuckoo for cocoa puffs .
i &apos;m just saying ,
it felt like it may have meant something .
ah , this takes me back .
leonard obsessing about penny .
i mean , don &apos;t get me wrong , i love your new stuff ,
but once in a while it &apos;s nice to hear the hits .
do &quot; our babies will be smart and beautiful . &quot;
that one always makes me laugh .
why do i bother talking to you people ?
if it &apos;ll make you feel better , we rarely listen .
hey , can i talk to you out here for a sec ?
yeah , sure .
i &apos;m starting to think we &apos;re never going to see that pizza .
so you &apos;re probably wondering what that was all about .
what , uh , the kissing and everything ?
nah , women do that to me all the time .
yeah , okay . the thing is , i kind of
told my father we got back together again .
what ? why ?
well , you &apos;re the first guy
he &apos;s ever really approved of , you know ?
you &apos;re a scientist who went to college
and you don &apos;t have a neck tattoo
or outstanding warrants or ... or a baby .
what kind of guys did you used to go out with ?
just guys .
anyway , when i told him we split up , he was heartbroken ,
and he kept bugging me , &quot; how &apos;s leonard ?
why can &apos;t you get back together with leonard ?
i bet leonard never tipped a cow over on himself . &quot;
so to get him off my back ,
i told him we worked things out .
really ?
how @-@ how &apos;d we manage that ?
what ?
i mean , did you apologize ?
did you have to woo me ?
get over yourself .
i whistled , you came running .
yeah , no , i don &apos;t think so .
okay , why are you arguing about this ?
i &apos;m just saying ,
if we fake got back together ,
that &apos;s totally not how it fake happened .
okay , whatever .
will you please just play along until my dad leaves ?
hold on , you actually want me
to deceive your father with some sort of
sham playacting and kissing ?
&apos;cause i &apos;m good with that .
penny , you out here ?
come on , honey , not in front of my dad .
relax , i &apos;ve seen you do a lot worse
with a lot stupider .
see ?
he doesn &apos;t mind .
so , leonard , i &apos;m taking your gal out
for a steak dinner ; you want to join us ?
oh , dad , that &apos;s nice , but leonard has to work .
right , leonard ?
uh , i do , i have to work .
but i &apos;m gonna blow that off to spend the evening
with my sweetie and her father , &apos; cause , you know ,
just the kind of boyfriend i am .
come here , you .
c @-@ 7 .
miss .
how could that be a miss ?
c @-@ 6 was a hit , c @-@ 8 was a hit .
part of your starship has to be on c @-@ 7 .
not if it has a hole in the middle .
what kind of spaceship has a hole in the middle ?
a romulan battle bagel ?
knock @-@ knock .
oh , great , you made it .
come on in .
i invited her .
so where &apos;s the telescope ?
it &apos;s in hawaii , but raj controls it from here .
he &apos;s hoping to see epsilon eridani dim , which would be
evidence of a planet orbiting it .
so we just sit and stare at the screen ,
waiting for something to happen ?
i did it with you when we rented .
yes , gena rowlands is a treasure .
you &apos;d better open up that bottle of wine
or i &apos;m gonna end up with swimmer &apos;s ear .
excuse me .
i can &apos;t be drinking , i &apos;m about to make
an important scientific discovery here .
what ? galileo did his best work while drinking wine .
how do you know that ?
well , he was italian .
it &apos;s a reasonable assumption .
dude , can you even open your mouth
without spewing a cultural stereotype ?
oh , i @-@ i &apos;m sorry , galileo drank diet sprite .
look , you &apos;re my best friend , she &apos;s my girlfriend ;
you should bond .
you know , like you and my mom did .
your mom creeps the hell out of me .
yes , but she &apos;s stopped calling you slumdog millionaire .
i do appreciate that .
here we go .
i &apos;d like to propose a toast .
to science and friendship .
hold on . wait .
no , it &apos;s okay , go ahead .
what ?
oh , i was working with
penicillin @-@ resistant gonorrhea in the lab today
and i was just trying to remember if i washed my hands .
thanks for the steak , wyatt .
my pleasure .
it &apos;s nice to have dinner with a boyfriend of penny &apos;s
that knows how to use a napkin .
so not funny , dad .
let me tell you about this one genius she was going out with ,
this @-@ this fella donnie .
oh , will you please let it go ?
donnie was gonna make millions turning farm waste
into biofuel and selling it to the government .
a lot of people are doing that .
oh , see ?
yeah , but all donnie did was mix pig poop with a little water
and pump it into his mom &apos;s camry .
yeah , that &apos;s great .
it &apos;s a funny story . moving on .
and donnie was a rocket scientist
compared to that boy
who wanted to get beer pong into the olympics .
what was his name , sweetheart ?
curtis , and i &apos;m pretty sure he was joking .
i don &apos;t know .
that petition looked real to me .
yeah , okay , i think this ends
the ex @-@ boyfriend portion of our evening .
well , i &apos;m just glad you finally found yourself a keeper .
thanks , wyatt .
i &apos;m a keeper .
leonard , you want to come in for a nightcap ?
oh , gee , dad , he &apos;d love to ,
but leonard has to work in the morning .
maybe i could go in a little late .
no , no , no , you can &apos;t .
your career is far too important .
behind every great man is a nagging woman
who won &apos;t let him have any fun , am i right , leonard ?
don &apos;t i know it .
well , good night , son .
good night , wyatt .
oh , good night , honey .
good night .
i love you .
love you , too .
oh , friggety @-@ frak .
not this again .
three , four , five-- pass go , get 2,000 rupees--
six , seven .
whoops . can &apos;t go any further . there &apos;s a sacred cow in my way .
bernadette , please tell your boyfriend
to cool it with the cow jokes .
it won &apos;t help .
once he finds a joke he likes , he sticks with it .
yeah .
like his haircut material .
oh , right . did you get your hair cut ?
&quot; no . i got them all cut . &quot;
which is still so funny .
and when you go to a chinese restaurant ,
he always gets the same fortune in his fortune cookie .
right . &quot; help , i &apos;m a prisoner
in a chinese fortune cookie factory . &quot;
okay , i think that &apos;s enough about me .
he &apos;s right . let &apos;s make fun of his mother .
&quot; howard , come rub my feet !
my corns are killing me ! &quot;
&quot; howard , help me out of the tub !
i &apos;m stuck again ! &quot;
coming .
hey , lovebug .
shut up .
you know what i &apos;ve been doing for the last hour ?
mm , dreamily doodling &quot; mrs. leonard hofstadter &quot;
in a notebook ?
listening to my father go on and on
about what a great guy you are .
you got to admit , i am ... i &apos;m delightful .
why are you making this so difficult ?
it &apos;s not difficult for me .
i &apos;m having fun .
leonard .
what do you want me to do ? you started this .
do you want to go over and tell him we &apos;re broken up ?
no .
well , then , what do you want ?
i don &apos;t know .
don &apos;t you think that &apos;s something you should
have figured out before you stomped over here ?
maybe .
leonard , penny , excellent .
i &apos;d like to say i &apos;m very happy that you &apos;re back together ,
and if i can figure out a way to do so
and sound sincere , i will .
in the meantime ,
i &apos;d like to go over some proposed changes
to the roommate agreement specifically to address
penny &apos;s annoying personal habits .
oh , my god .
what personal habits ?
i have a list .
fyi , overuse of the phrase &quot; oh , my god &quot; is number 12 .
okay , sheldon , you don &apos;t have to do this
because leonard and i are not ... ba @-@ ba @-@ ba @-@ ba .
are you sure you want to include him in this ?
include me in what ?
is there a plot afoot ?
i &apos;ll have no truck with plots .
no , you &apos;re right .
no , there &apos;s ... there &apos;s no plots , no trucks , no feet .
so what other annoying habits shall we discuss ?
uh , we don &apos;t discuss anything .
leonard is the signatory to the roommate agreement .
as such , he bears responsibility
for all your infractions and must pay all fines .
fines ?
yes .
if penny &apos;s going to be spending nights here again ,
you &apos;ll need to set up an escrow account .
sign here .
hello , hawaii .
this is dr. koothrappali in pasadena .
i &apos;d like you to reposition the telescope , please .
scarlett johansson &apos;s house !
i &apos;m kidding , hawaii .
mahalo .
whoo !
it might have been a mistake
to open that second bottle of wine .
well , live and learn .
so , raj , do you think this planet you &apos;re looking for
could have an atmosphere that supports life ?
maybe .
if it did , i &apos;d be famous .
i &apos;d be on the cover of magazines .
and then , instead of living alone
in my tiny apartment , i &apos;d have a big mansion .
that sounds great .
it is .
if you like wandering around a big , empty house
with no one to love you .
we &apos;d come visit you .
no , you wouldn &apos;t .
you &apos;d be intimidated by my wealth and fame .
my only friends would be my genetically engineered monkey butler
and the little people i hired to be my living chess set .
he &apos;s taking a turn to the dark side , isn &apos;t he ?
hold on . he could come back .
oh , what &apos;s the point of everything ?
nope . he &apos;s gone .
you know it &apos;s been more than a year
since i &apos;ve even kissed a girl ?
what about that hookup at comic @-@ con you told me about ?
oh , grow up . i was lying .
i lie all the time . nobody wants to kiss me .
oh , you poor , poor thing .
raj , you have to know you &apos;re a wonderful man .
there are a lot of girls out there who &apos;ll want to kiss you .
where ?
you just have to look .
well , this was fun .
oh ! i think i got a nibble .
oh , be careful .
give him some line .
okay , now reel him in .
oh , look at that baby .
they &apos;re really biting , huh ?
yeah . they do that when you set it on easy .
oh , that &apos;s me .
oh , hi , sweetie .
yeah , i got up early and didn &apos;t want to wake you ,
so i went out for coffee and ran into leonard on the way back .
guess what-- we &apos;re fishing .
yeah . right here on his couch .
hey , baby . i love you !
that &apos;s leonard .
says he loves you .
what ?
i see .
the whole thing &apos;s bull squirt , huh ?
well , that &apos;s very disappointing .
there &apos;s been something i &apos;ve been meaning to tell you .
i can &apos;t believe you would lie to me like that .
just for the record , i did not want to be a part of this .
i &apos;ll get to you in a minute .
no hurry .
that my own daughter thinks i don &apos;t love her enough
to support her no matter what choices she makes--
well , that hurts me deeply .
i &apos;m sorry , daddy ...
let me finish .
i thought we were past the days
when you would try to pull the wool over my eyes .
telling me the baggie in your underwear drawer is potpourri ?
and the pee stick in your bathroom is to check for diabetes ?
you know , i &apos;m sorry .
you &apos;re a grown woman , and i respect your right
to make your own decisions ,
but all i ask is you respect me enough
to be honest about them .
you &apos;re right . look , from now on , i will tell you the truth .
thank you . now , why don &apos;t you go and put some clothes on
and we &apos;ll grab a bite to eat before i head for the airport .
now you ...
daddy , he had nothing to do ...
keep walking .
okay .
please , please , please don &apos;t give up on her .
what ?
i can &apos;t go back to the skateboard idiots , the white rappers
and all those sweaty dumb @-@ asses with their backwards hats .
gee , i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s in the cards , sir .
then , stack the deck .
cheat . lie . i don &apos;t care .
i want grandkids before i die ,
and i want them to grow up in a house without wheels .
i &apos;ll give it a shot .
thank you .
now i &apos;m going to do something here to help you along .
excuse me ?
just don &apos;t panic .
now , get your sorry , lying ass out of my face
and make sure i never see it again !
oh , the reverse psychology thing . i see . that &apos;s very clever .
don &apos;t yap . just get out .
i &apos;ll friend you on facebook .
oh , there you are .
just so you know , i was up all night ,
but i have finally completed
the penny @-@ specific section of the new roommate agreement .
yeah well , not necessary . we broke up again .
do you even think about other people , leonard ?
do you ?
oh , how &apos;d it go last night ?
oh , you know .
same old , same old .
looked through a telescope , saw some stars . big whoop .
really ?
you waited months for time with that telescope . what happened ?
why ? you writing a book ?
i &apos;m going to propose a hypothesis .
last night , raj accidentally made contact with an alien civilization
and has been ordered by the united states government to keep it a secret .
nothing happened . can we please just change the subject ?
that sounds rehearsed . we are not alone .
you get to play with raj &apos;s big telescope last night ?
where did that come from ?
he never touched my telescope .
way to go shutting up .
i did shut up . now you shut up .
fine .
thank you .
