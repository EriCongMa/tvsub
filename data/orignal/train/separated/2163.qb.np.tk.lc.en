beth , he &apos;s going down kapiolani .
roger that .
get him , leland .
we &apos;re on him .
beth , go around the block and cut him off .
where do you think you &apos;re going , bruddah ?
come on , steve , you &apos;re slacking off .
i &apos;m trying to keep up with you here , ma .
keep up with me for what , boy .
you &apos;re gonna need a nap by lunch , ma .
you talking about yourself ?
doing okay ?
i &apos;m fine , how are you ?
dig deep , here we go .
yeah .
now that &apos;s what i call a perfect start to the day .
maybe next time catherine could join us .
catherine ?
yeah .
okay .
good .
i &apos;ll mention it to her at lunch .
you &apos;re going to lunch with catherine ?
just the two of you ?
yeah .
why , is that a problem ?
no , i mean , i don &apos;t know .
well , you said you wanted us to get to know each other .
right ?
yeah , i suppose i did say
those very words .
yeah .
i just thought you and mick were going away this week .
that &apos;s next week .
this week he &apos;s a little busy following me around .
look , mom , about that , i &apos;m sorry .
what kind of son hires a p.i. to keep tabs on his mother ?
okay , let &apos;s be honest ,
we &apos;re not exactly the waltons .
you &apos;re a former spy who
faked her own death 20 years ago .
i got issues , mom . i got trust issues .
okay , get over it .
and get over catherine and i getting together .
it &apos;s just lunch .
hold on . mcgarrett .
yeah , i &apos;m on my way .
yeah , sorry , ma .
duty calls . i get it .
i gotta go .
have a great day .
bye .
love you .
love you , ma .
tell catherine i said hello .
yeah , don &apos;t worry , we &apos;re not going to talk about you .
much .
cute , ma , cute .
there you go , sarge .
there &apos;s the warrant , there &apos;s your guy .
be good , russell .
first time you beat us to a crime scene .
what &apos;s up , dog ?
hey , steve mcgarrett , how you doing ?
wondering when we &apos;d run into five @-@ o.
busy day , huh ?
yeah , every day &apos;s busy .
who &apos;s your boy ?
that &apos;s russell .
third striker
who figured he &apos;d run rather than go to jail .
ah , well , he figured wrong .
exactly .
so , we made a report to hpd , mcgarrett .
can we go so we can book our guy ?
yeah , get out of here .
all right , stay alive , copper .
good to see you .
you , too .
what do we got , max ?
my first impression upon seeing the victim
on the roof of the car
was that she was a jumper .
well , if this is a suicide , max , what are we doing here ?
well , i did say that was my first impression .
okay , max , what &apos;s your second impression ?
the victim &apos;s tibia shot through her kneecaps upon impact .
that &apos;s consistent with someone who &apos;s actually
trying to fight the fall and land feet first .
jumpers and unconscious victims
tend to give in and fall horizontal .
are you saying somebody pushed her ?
it &apos;s quite possible .
additionally , there is a small contusion
on the side of her head ,
not caused by the fall .
looks fresh .
and there are several healing contusions
and hematomas on her arms .
looks like somebody used this girl as a punching bag .
i &apos;ll know more when i conduct a full autopsy ,
but , as of this moment , homicide cannot be ruled out .
all right , what else do we know about her ?
we found what looks to be a ticket stub in her front pocket .
but there &apos;s too much blood on it to read anything .
i sent it over to fong to see if he could pull something .
we get an id ?
her name is dana moore .
she &apos;s a kindergarten teacher at kaimuki elementary .
i checked with the super .
said that she was a good tenant ;
well @-@ liked , quiet .
always the &quot; but , &quot; got to be a &quot; but . &quot;
but according to him ,
she recently broke up with her long @-@ term boyfriend--
a guy named john hanson--
and apparently it wasn &apos;t pretty .
wasn &apos;t pretty like he was abusive ?
no , not quite that bad , but the super said he had
to break up an argument between them in the lobby last week .
i also found this .
it &apos;s her cell phone in her apartment .
check this out .
she ignored nine calls from hanson last night .
i never laid a hand on dana .
so , how &apos;d she get all banged up ?
i asked her the same thing all the time .
she just said she was clumsy .
she was-- she was clumsy ?
that &apos;s very hard to believe .
look , i never believed it either ,
but that &apos;s what she told me .
try again , john .
dana kept secrets .
it &apos;s one of the reasons we broke up .
is that why you called her
nine times last night ?
i was at a bar , had a few beers ,
ended up dialing her number .
where were you this morning ?
surfing .
hit dawn patrol .
there &apos;s at least 15 people in the lineup
that can back that up .
and what about last night ?
do you know where dana was ?
i asked her to have dinner with me
but she said she was busy .
wouldn &apos;t tell me what she was doing .
she was always hiding something from me .
hey , max , why you , uh ,
turning our victim into a member of the blue man group ?
oh , very humorous , as always ,
detective williams .
the dye is called toluidine .
it is quite useful in identifying
microtrauma to the skin .
microtrauma ? what are you looking for ?
an injection site .
i believe it will shed light on the manner of death .
manner of death ? the fall didn &apos;t kill her ?
well , strictly speaking , it did .
however , her toxicology showed that
dana had a fatal dose of gamma hydroxybutyrate
in her blood stream
while there was no evidence of ghb in her stomach contents .
so , you figured she was injected ?
precisely .
stand back , please .
you found something ?
see this pinpoint area here , that &apos;s a darker blue ?
that &apos;s the injection site .
she could not have injected herself
like this at that angle .
correct .
she may have been disoriented
by the effects of the poison ,
which caused her to fall off her balcony .
but her death was definitely not an accident .
when was she injected ?
based on the rate it had metabolized ,
i would say six to eight hours prior to her fall .
we got to come up with a timeline ,
figure out where dana was last night .
yo , chin , what do you got ?
well , the boyfriend &apos;s story checks out .
spent the night at speakeasys in hale &apos;iwa
and then surfed dawn patrol this morning .
great , any idea where dana was ?
yeah , i talked to one of her co @-@ teachers
who invited dana to dinner last night
but she said she couldn &apos;t make it
because she already had plans with her boyfriend .
she said she was
thinking about getting back together with him .
well , we know that &apos;s a lie .
she blew off her ex @-@ boyfriend .
all right , so she lied to her co @-@ worker .
her boyfriend must &apos;ve been telling the truth ;
she was hiding something .
looks like i can help with that .
fong processed the ticket stub that was found on dana &apos;s body .
turns out it was a parking lot entrance ticket
from the kapiolani rec center .
it was time stamped yesterday 6 : 45 p.m.
all right , whatever dana was doing last night ,
it started there .
oh , great .
hey , look at this .
the boyfriend said she was keeping a lot of secrets .
this looks like a big one .
we know what dana moore
was doing here last night .
you mean dicey hot .
go !
come on , go hard .
go ! go ! go ! go !
come on , go hard , go hard .
back up , back up .
come on , recover . come on , come through .
oh . recover ! recover !
well , that explains the bruises .
explains a lot more than that .
dana moore was living a double life as dicey hot .
that &apos;s great .
now we &apos;ve got two unrelated suspect pools to choose from :
the people she taught elementary school with ...
and , uh ... derby girls .
i know where i &apos;d start looking .
nice ! good !
go , go , go , go , go , go , go .
almost there .
watch the elbows .
come on , hot lips . watch the inside line .
hey , i want to see a wall .
break through it , break through it .
that &apos;s it , very nice .
dirty damsel , get back in that pack .
come on , crimson .
hey , coach .
i can &apos;t believe she &apos;s dead .
do you know who might &apos;ve wanted to hurt dana ?
who ?
dicey .
i didn &apos;t even know her other name was dana .
what did you say your name was ?
silk slayer .
crimson bride is my real name .
oh , okay .
parents big denzel fans ?
no , i just ...
seriously ?
if dicey was murdered , and that &apos;s a big if ,
i &apos;m pretty sure it wasn &apos;t by someone involved in derby .
dicey was the heart and soul of this team .
i can &apos;t believe she &apos;s gone .
all right , what can you tell me about dicey off the track ?
uh , only that her real name was dana .
listen , i &apos;d like to help you out more
but i really got to get back to practice .
we &apos;re skating in the finals tomorrow , so ...
the diamond dolls are competing tomorrow ?
dicey wouldn &apos;t have wanted us to forfeit the championship .
we &apos;re gonna compete if ... if i can find another jammer .
you don &apos;t have a second @-@ string jammer ?
got a couple of backup blockers ,
but dicey was our only jammer .
i got to go hold tryouts now .
all right , hey , thank you .
you got it .
okay , um , i &apos;m not really getting
anything from crimson bride ,
dirty damsel , ivana kiss ,
or any of the other ladies .
ivana kiss ?
yeah .
her parents must be very proud .
they &apos;re not exactly what i would call friendly
to law enforcement .
these girls ,
they spend so much time on the track , right
i mean , there &apos;s got to be somebody here who knows
something about dana and what was going on with her .
i &apos;d say that we should interrogate them ,
but something is telling me that ,
that would backfire badly .
you know what we need ?
no .
we need somebody on the inside ,
somebody these girls can open up to .
you &apos;ve got to be kidding me .
i wouldn &apos;t ask if there was another way ,
and besides , i &apos;ve already cleared it with your c.o. ,
so you &apos;re on .
okay , steve ,
if you &apos;re trying to stop me from having lunch
with your mother ,
there are other ways .
would i do that ?
yes , yes , you would .
this is a legitimate undercover assignment .
would you help me , please ?
why you laughing ? come on .
yeah-- no , listen , we need to get inside ,
we need to figure out which of dana &apos;s teammates she was close to
and we need to know what was going on in her life
that got her killed .
okay , so run her financials ,
pull her phone records .
already tried that-- dead ends .
well , then send kono .
you know what ? i totally would ,
except i &apos;ve already been there ,
they &apos;ve seen my face , they know i &apos;m five @-@ o.
okay , look , i would love to help you guys out ,
i would , really , but i can &apos;t do this .
why can &apos;t you do this ?
i don &apos;t roller @-@ skate .
yes , but you ice @-@ skate .
you competed professionally . your father showed me pictures
of you in your little tutus and your outfits ,
the unitards and stuff that you used to wear .
that is not the same thing at all ,
and besides , guys , i was like 15 years old .
how different can it be , catherine ?
you are out of your mind .
i don &apos;t , i don &apos;t even ...
what , what is a jammer ?
a jammer-- it &apos;s very simple .
uh , there &apos;s only two positions in roller derby .
you got jammers and you got blockers .
the jammer scores by lapping around the track .
gets one point for every blocker
on the opposing side that she passes .
very simple .
i &apos;m sorry , i had no idea you were a fan of roller derby .
no , i @-@ i @-@ i &apos;m not a fan ; my mother was .
she thought that a catfight on wheels
was good home family entertainment .
skinny minnie miller was actually her favorite player .
she had ...
who ? seriously ,
there , there was a player named skinny minnie miller ?
yeah , yeah .
i remember when she got taken out by sweet stephanie
at queens of the roller derby .
it was a big thing .
okay , can we focus here for a minute ?
yeah , let &apos;s focus .
yep . so , uh ,
i understand completely , if i &apos;m a jammer ,
then basically all the blockers on the other team
are trying to kill me .
that &apos;s it pretty much . yeah .
hopefully the diamond dolls have a good blocking defense .
yeah , that would be good .
okay , so , uh , diamond dolls--
they got tryouts this afternoon ,
so all you got to do is go and make the team .
oh , is that all ?
mm @-@ hmm .
okay .
alice trooper ,
you &apos;re up !
get up ...
all right , you four line it up .
i want to thank you guys for coming out today ,
for your interest in skating with the diamond dolls .
unfortunately we can only take one of you .
it was close , but i made my decision .
i came in second .
you what ?
i came in second .
second place doesn &apos;t put you on the team ,
catherine , i needed you to win .
first place .
oh , come on .
i mean , don &apos;t i even get an &quot; a &quot; for effort ?
i mean , i was really good today ,
especially considering that i laced up for the first time today ,
you know , and you were totally right about the ice @-@ skating .
i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s like muscle memory or whatever ,
but i &apos;m like a natural
when it comes to derby skating .
i am really good .
what was the name of the girl who beat you out ?
w-- why ?
what are you gonna do ?
steve .
oh , god .
this is the championship .
you got to work harder than that .
i need 110 % , let &apos;s go .
that &apos;s it , that &apos;s it , well done .
coach .
oh , hey , alice .
oh , i &apos;m so glad you were still available .
yeah , me , too .
hey , question : um , what changed your mind
about bringing me on the team ?
well , look , you were basically neck and neck
with the girl that came in first at the tryouts .
thing is , she got arrested for four unpaid parking tickets .
can you believe the cops in this town ?
that &apos;s awful .
yeah , what are you going to do ?
anyway , the locker room &apos;s through there .
why don &apos;t you gear up and come back out on the track ?
all right , cool .
welcome to the dolls .
thank you .
all right , girls , come on .
hey , what , are you looking for someone ?
no .
hi . i &apos;m alice trooper .
i &apos;m your new jammer .
yeah , we &apos;ll see .
i &apos;m sorry about dicey .
i never saw her skate , but i heard she was amazing .
were you two close ?
she had my back .
let &apos;s go , let &apos;s go , let &apos;s go .
work it , alice , work it .
come on , alice .
work it , alice , get through there , get through there ,
get through there , get through there .
very nice .
work it , alice .
get through there , get through there , get through there .
that &apos;s it , go , go , go , go , very nice .
thank you .
what , are you deaf ? track &apos;s closed ,
you need to leave .
let &apos;s go outside , then .
not gonna happen .
such a jerk .
he your boyfriend ?
yeah , in his dreams .
he &apos;s just a guy who doesn &apos;t like to be told no .
yeah ? do you think he &apos;s dangerous ?
just steer clear of that guy , okay ?
he &apos;s bad news .
thanks for blocking me out there .
you got it .
for the last time i &apos;m telling you ,
the track is closed , you cannot be here .
you need to leave .
this guy &apos;s name is ted landry .
he &apos;s a low @-@ rent bookie who works the derby circuit ,
among others .
who knew there was money in roller derby ?
apparently the wagers for the final bout were coming in heavy
for the diamond dolls to win , thanks to dicey hot .
maybe landry had too much action
and wouldn &apos;t have been able to pay the bets
if the diamond dolls won .
getting rid of dicey hot to avoid losing his shirt
sounds like motive to me .
ted landry , can we talk to you for a minute .
don &apos;t move .
hey , keep your hands where i can see them .
you guys got it all wrong .
there &apos;s no way i killed dicey .
okay , well , enlighten us .
i got an alibi .
i was at the blaisdell last night for the mma fight .
you got a ticket stub ?
better-- they showed me on the jumbotron .
come on , they got to have a record of that .
and my credit card--
i used it to pick up my ticket at will call last night .
you can check it .
okay , well ,
even if your alibi checks out , that still does not mean
you weren &apos;t involved in the murder .
without dicey hot the south shore sirens were
a lock to win that final bout .
her death put money in your pocket .
see , that &apos;s what we call a motive , ted .
okay , look , i swear i didn &apos;t kill her ...
but i might have approached her
with a little business proposition .
what are you talking about ?
i offered her five grand to throw the bout .
five grand--
that &apos;s a lot to a kindergarten teacher .
yeah , well she turned me down , said
winning her championship meant more to her than that .
here .
thanks .
that was a hard hit .
you okay ?
yeah , the play out here is a little
more aggressive than i &apos;m used to .
yeah .
that about what i could expect during the finals ?
yeah , pretty much .
the south shore sirens are a tough team ,
especially sugar stix .
what &apos;s she , their jammer ?
nothing sweet about her , though .
she , uh , cracked one of dicey &apos;s ribs , broke
two of her fingers , and shattered her wrist .
yeah , that sounds a little extreme .
i guess , uh , sugar stix and dicey kind of did
have it out for each other .
what do you mean ?
they were always in each other &apos;s faces .
you know ? last summer , sugar stix
took a cheap shot at dicey and slammed her pretty hard .
she even had to put a steel pin in her wrist .
dicey almost even pressed charges .
but she never did .
yeah , it sounds like
their rivalry was about more than just roller derby .
yeah . if there was ,
it wasn &apos;t something dicey talked about .
thanks to catherine &apos;s
intel , i planted a uni outside the siren &apos;s practice ,
then ran sugar &apos;s license plate when she left .
we get an id ?
yeah , it turns out sugar stix is one dr. sharon morgan .
she &apos;s a pediatrician with a practice in kahala .
so , what &apos;s sugar &apos;s beef with dicey ?
yeah , yeah . i said it out loud , and i meant it . go ahead .
all right . uh , actually , i wish i knew .
it turns out that they actually might have known each other
outside of roller derby .
dr. morgan recently enrolled her son
at the school where dana taught .
okay , well , maybe whatever was going on between them moved
off the track , into the real world .
hi . uh , dr. morgan , i &apos;m sorry to barge in here like this ,
but your receptionist said we could find you here .
okay , well , i &apos;m with a patient ,
so , you &apos;re gonna have to wait .
uh , we &apos;re with
five @-@ o , so unfortunately , we can &apos;t wait . sorry .
we got to talk to dr. sugar stix .
i am so sorry about this .
okay , i &apos;ll be back in a minute .
i think you &apos;ve made a mistake .
oh , okay .
well , if you &apos;re not sugar stix ,
where &apos;d you get the derby injuries ?
okay , so what if i &apos;m sugar stix ?
there &apos;s no crime in that .
well , you &apos;re the one who &apos;s hiding it .
look ,
i am proud to be a south shore siren , all right ? i am .
but i &apos;m also a physician , and there are a lot of parents
in this practice that would think twice
about bringing their children to see me
if they knew how many people i was putting in the hospital .
that &apos;s a good point .
so , dicey hot threatened to out you at school ?
that &apos;s why you killed her ?
what ? !
is that why you killed her ?
no !
come on , please .
look , i did not kill her .
you didn &apos;t kill her . you roughed her up pretty bad on the track .
everyone gets roughed up on the track .
she fractured my foot and gave me a concussion .
people seem to think that you two had it out for each other .
on the track ... sure , but it wasn &apos;t personal .
look , you want to know who really had it out for dicey ?
talk to her own teammates .
what do you mean-- her own teammates ?
coach blair-- he put dicey on a pedestal ,
and that didn &apos;t sit so well with some of the other dolls .
the dolls were jealous ?
hell , yeah .
look , whatever was going on over there ,
it was bad enough that dicey wanted to jump ship
at the end of the season .
hey , can you talk ?
uh ... yeah , yeah , i &apos;m good .
what do you know
about dicey hot wanting to leave the diamond dolls ?
no . everything i &apos;ve heard is that she loved this team .
not according to sugar stix .
she said the other girls on the team were jealous .
um , they are really competitive .
i suppose they could be covering for each other .
listen , catherine ,
i need you to get me a roster with the girls &apos; real names on it
so i can start checking alibis .
yeah . okay , i &apos;m on it .
all right , thank you .
hey , that was fast .
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . what ? dr. who ?
mom .
you all right ?
i &apos;m fine . i just hit my head .
it &apos;s nothing .
okay , all right , um , let me get this straight .
you , uh ... you @-@ you got home ,
you interrupted a burglar ,
he knocked you down , and he took off ?
yeah , that &apos;s , uh ... that &apos;s pretty much it .
and he bypasses the entire security system ?
guess so .
oh , he &apos;s a pretty sophisticated thief , mom .
i mean , it took five guys three days to install that system .
oh , please .
you &apos;re exaggerating .
and then he got a jump on you ?
you get a look at this guy ?
uh , no , no . he was ...
he was wearing a ski mask . um ,
it all ... it all happened so fast .
i want to help , okay ? i want to help , and i can &apos;t ...
steve , please , i don &apos;t want to talk about it , okay ? i &apos;m fine .
i just want to get out of here and move on .
okay .
thanks .
all right , but you &apos;re not going back to your place .
once you get released from here , you &apos;re coming home
till we find you a safe building to move into .
i @-@ i got to get back to work .
i &apos;ll see you at home .
don &apos;t worry .
catherine , what are you doing here ?
danny told me about your mom .
you &apos;re supposed to be undercover .
no . it &apos;s okay . we &apos;re done for the day . all the girls left .
it would have looked weird if i stayed .
all right . did you get the roster ?
no . not yet .
i got to access coach blair &apos;s computer ,
and he stays there late the night before a big bout , so ...
don &apos;t worry about it . i &apos;m on it , okay ?
i need to be here right now . what happened ?
well , according to doris , she , uh ...
she interrupted a burglary .
this doesn &apos;t look like a normal burglary .
no , that &apos;s because it wasn &apos;t a normal burglary .
this was a surgical strike .
whoever did this knew exactly what they were looking for ,
and they knew doris well enough
to know where she would hide something .
she &apos;s lying to me again .
i don &apos;t know what to do , catherine .
steve ?
i need to tell you something .
what ?
have you ever heard of , um , someone named mangosta ?
mangosta ? no . why ?
he &apos;s an operative from doris &apos; past in covert ops .
did you get this information from navy intel ?
no . no , it &apos;s not .
then how do you know this ?
there was a ...
there was an incident that happened a while ago ,
and mangosta came after doris here on the island .
she managed to turn the tables on him , but i think this ...
this could be connected .
why did you not tell me that ?
i wanted to , and i should have .
yeah , you should have !
i made a promise .
and doris-- she didn &apos;t want you to worry , so i didn &apos;t ...
you should go , okay ?
steve ?
catherine .
hey , alice .
what are you doing here ?
i was looking for a knee brace .
is coach blair here ?
no , i haven &apos;t seen him .
i think he might be on the track already .
okay , well , the ... the knee braces are in the locker room .
great . i &apos;ll see you out there .
coach . sirens are looking strong out there .
hey , you got a second ?
see that girl right there ?
yeah , that one .
who &apos;s ready to taste the pain ?
welcome everyone to the pacific roller derby championship
between the 14 @-@ 1 diamond dolls
and the 13 @-@ 2 south shore sirens .
and bad @-@ to @-@ the @-@ bone sugar stix ,
full of sugar and spice and nothing nice .
these ladies have battled through a long , brutal season
to get here , and you better believe
they &apos;re gonna leave it all on the track in this bout .
trash talk is over , it &apos;s derby time .
ladies , let &apos;s rock and roll !
right out of the blocks ,
siren &apos;s jammer sunstroke breaks through the pack as lead jammer
while sugar stix lays in hard
to crimson bride .
this sure isn &apos;t the first time
sugar and crimson have battled it out on the track .
we can expect a hard @-@ hitting bout tonight .
big whip through the pack puts dolls jammer alice trooper
into scoring position .
but siren &apos;s jammer sunstroke is on the move and oh !
scores a big point ,
taking out crimson bride to end the jam .
you okay ?
yeah , yeah , yeah , i &apos;m fine .
look , i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t block you .
don &apos;t worry about blocking me .
look , yor &apos;re a jammer . your job is to score points .
okay ? so start scoring &apos; em .
once again , ladies and gentlemen , here we go .
oh , yeah , crimson getting
some payback on sugar stix .
sunstroke making a big push to get into scoring position
and oh ! big foul .
crimson bride is down and looking hurt .
that &apos;s the second major foul for sunstroke .
she &apos;s really got it out for crimson bride .
crimson , over here !
big boos from the crowd as crimson bride goes to the bench .
hot lips .
you &apos;re in .
i &apos;m good to skate .
i can skate .
extend it .
you &apos;re sitting out this jam . you &apos;re sitting out this jam .
catherine get you the team roster ?
she did more than that .
she sent over coach blair &apos;s entire hard drive .
anything interesting ?
yeah ,
and it wasn &apos;t the roster .
check this out .
these girls look drugged .
that would explain the ghb in dana moore &apos;s system .
those were on blair &apos;s computer .
who is this scumbag ?
that &apos;s a good question .
his id dates back only five years in hawaii ,
so i ran facial recognition
on a dmv photo and got a hit .
meet larry banks .
he &apos;s an ex @-@ con from seattle .
he did time for producing and distributing pornography .
his m.o. was drugging girls
and taking their pictures .
looks like he &apos;s up to his old tricks .
if he &apos;s been drugging them ,
most of these girls might not even know
they &apos;ve been victimized .
maybe dicey figured out what was going on .
okay , so , if she confronted him
after the semi @-@ final match ,
that could &apos;ve been when banks shot her up with the ghb .
and you know what ? he could have
told her that it was cortisone for her shoulder .
and that would &apos;ve made the timing work out right .
max said she was injected six to eight hours before she fell .
ghb is a very slow @-@ acting drug .
she would &apos;ve gotten progressively more
disoriented and unstable .
until she fell off her balcony .
come on , girls , come on !
skate hard !
coach , i want to go back in .
no , i already told you , until you let me
give you a shot for that arm , you &apos;re not going back in .
i don &apos;t need it .
then you &apos;re not gonna skate .
fine . fine . shoot me up .
in my office .
hey , lou , take over .
we &apos;ll be right back .
where did crimson go ? she okay ?
i &apos;m sure she &apos;s fine .
she &apos;s taken harder hits than that .
okay , let &apos;s get this over with .
where &apos;s the needle ?
this has been one of the most intense championships in memory
as the south shore sirens battle the diamond dolls for the title .
it &apos;s neck and neck and there &apos;s no sign
that either of these teams is gonna go down without a fight .
the dolls had the early lead ,
but jam after jam , the sirens ...
where &apos;s catherine ? i don &apos;t see catherine anywhere .
i don &apos;t see banks , either .

i tripled the dose .

even when i @-@ i didn &apos;t ask for help .
even when i ...

that &apos;s just who she was .

and a protector , and she had our backs
all the way to the end .
