We need four units of o-neg.
Bring that bench over here.
They went to cut off the door,
and all I could think was he's gonna bleed out.
We need more time.
I was pissed, but then I thought,
"No, we need less distance to the O.R., so --
So, you brought -- the whole damn car.
How is he?
He's hanging on, barely.
I remember in school someone telling me
I came from a broken home.
That's what they used to call it
when your parents got divorced.
This isn't the way we usually do that.
I had to do it this way.
No, no, no, we see why you did it.
Okay. Look, I just wanted to give him --
a second chance.
We got a second chance.
...even though getting divorced
was the least broken thing they ever did.
Hey, Keith, it's Meredith.
Thanks for having me over.
How's Joan?
What's the word on my baby?
We'll find out for you. We got you.
When I heard that as a kid,
I wondered if broken homes were
where the broken people lived.
Still feeling those toes, Joan?
Yeah.
Good.
Um, you guys, let's just stop.
Let's stop for a sec.
What's happening?
There's just a little bleeding,
which is normal after a delivery,
but we're gonna get you checked out
before you have your spinal surgery, okay?
It was silly. I mean, I was just a little kid.
Gonna take her.
No, no, what are you doing?
What are you doing with my baby?
Just for a while.
No, please! We were crushed in a car!
My fiance's dead! You're not taking my baby!
Please no!
Joan, your baby's doing fine, okay?
Please!
We just need to check you out.
Okay, you need to take him to the NICU and page Karev.
But to this day, I still wonder.
No!
It looks like uterine atony. We need to move fast.
We move fast, we paralyze her.
We move too slow and she bleeds to death.
Okay.
Yeah, I already spoke to mom.
Amelia.
I don't know how fast you're moving on the house.
I haven't even accepted an offer yet, so --
I can have my stuff out next week. Is that soon enough?
Ted, I don't care whose side of the story.
I'm not sure I can make it any sooner.
You don't have to.
I should've been out a while ago.
Derek is the one who invited me, and he's gone, so --
I -- yes, I am listening.
Dad...
I have to go.
Is Alex in the NICU?
Don't know and don't care, 'cause apparently,
He thinks I'm some sort of '50s housewife
who he can tell where to be and what to do
and when to bake a pot roast.
I'm holding a baby.
Who's this?
Come on, here.
There's been a lot of talking,
but not a lot of getting me out of the car.
That's still the plan, right -- get Keith out of the car?
That's the plan.
When Joanie called and told me she was pregnant,
you know what my first thought was?
Run like hell.
We'd only had the one date.
And she agrees, it kind of sucked.
I think we had sex just to stop the awkward silence.
And then boom -- insta-family, like sea monkeys.
It was scary.
Now I can't believe I ever felt like that.
Now all I want to do is see them.
Grey, we're ready to cut the roof.
Okay, Keith,
It's gonna get real loud and then it's gonna get scary,
and then we're gonna get you out, okay?
Loud, scary, free.
Okay.
Okay.
Arizona's having trouble
controlling the post-partum hemorrhage.
This just keeps getting--
Edwards.
What are you doing?
I'm scrubbing in.
No, you're not.
I gave you one job -- to keep her in the collar
until trauma cleared her.
It was the interns who --
And you left her in the care of first-day interns.
They should've known better.
No, you should've known better. You can go now.
You are no longer going anywhere near this patient, got it?
Go.
Roof coming off! Okay, guys, you're clear.
We need a trauma panel and type and cross for eight.
Got it. Drawing labs.
No blood in the pericardium.
Penetrating thoraco-abdominal injury.
Ultrasound, please.
Keith, talk to me. How do you feel?
Uh...popular.
Funny. That's funny.
Okay, guys, when you clear, we're gonna cut away
the piece of the door here that's impaling him,
then you can get him inside, okay?
All right.
Dr. Grey.
I have an update on his fiancee.
April certainly thought outside the box.
I like this Kepner.
I never thought I would like Kepner.
You know, old Kepner was --
There was pigtails and bunny rabbits and smiling.
Lots of smiling,
but Kepner the reboot, Kepner 2.0, she's crazy!
She's fierce.
She's womaned up.
Thank you, united states army.
Bailey, Hunt has this.
I need you to handle everything else in the E.R.
You are in charge.
Get used to it.
Yes, sir!
I thought I made myself perfectly clear.
You can't just appoint a new chief.
There are rules and recommendations to be made,
and then the board votes.
Just because something's been done one way forever
doesn't mean it shouldn't change.
It's called evolution.
No.
What you're talking about is called dictatorship,
and I did not sign up for a dictatorship, Catherine Avery.
No one asked you to, Richard Webber.
That's the problem -- you never ask, you only tell.
Well, let me tell you how this is gonna --
Look, I don't want to listen to another word about it!
Let's get back to it!
Excuse me.
I-I can't. I'm...
Hey, Keith. Stay with me.
I have some news for you.
Joan's okay.
She's headed into surgery, and you have a baby boy.
A...boy?
A boy?
I have a son.
Okay, Joan, I'm gonna put you out now, okay?
Uterus is flaccid. She's hemorrhaging.
Okay, we got to put her under.
You got to get this under control now.
I know that.
I need a balloon catheter.
Is she out?
Not yet, why?
Joan, Keith is here.
He's here. He's alive.
Keith's here?
They're working on him now.
Wilson, go.
Pressure's at 70. We're losing her.
Keith, hang in there. Hang in there.
Okay, stop!
Hey, stop! Stop! Stop! Okay, hold up.
What is it, Grey?
We can't do this. Not like this.
It's gonna tear him apart.
We're gonna open him up out here?
It's the only way. We start an ex-lap.
Clamp everything we can.
It'll buy us time till we get him upstairs.
Only five or six minutes till he bleeds out.
That's plenty of time.
Guys, guys, all O.R.s are full.
All of them?
Tunnel collapse victims.
No, no, we have a plastics O.R. available.
That's all the way at the other end of the building.
That's impossible.
Nothing's impossible.
We just -- all right,
we clear a path to the east elevator.
Move everything out of the way,
Stop all foot traffic, lock down the elevator.
Can he make it that far?
No, but he will.
He doesn't have a choice, right?
So, we run.
All out like olympians.
It's plenty of time. It's plenty of time.
Let's prep him for an ex-lap out here.
Okay.
Okay.
I am not crying wolf.
Sir?
I do not make decisions lightly, and I don't bow to dictators.
Miranda Bailey, you will be
Grey Sloan Memorial's next chief of surgery!
Congratulations!
Thank you.
Catheter is working, and the bleeding has stopped.
No tear in the dura, amazingly.
So, an intern opened her collar?
Oh, stupid.
Wait, was that the intern that we thought was an attending?
You mistook an intern for an attending?
Yeah, he was pretty much running the trauma.
Like a boss. Like a hot, hot boss.
Somebody should get into that.
Maybe you should get into that.
You know what? You should get into that.
I don't think so.
I have started a strict no workplace dating policy.
I hear you.
It's all too...you know?
They see you, all of you.
Then they come to work and they see you here, too,
And you try to keep it professional
and get things done, but suddenly you're thinking,
"I was naked on you before."
Or "I wish you were naked now."
"Hey, remember when you were there at my very rock bottom
and I went down the rabbit hole and dragged you in with me
and bared the darkest parts
of my soul to you in the midnight hours?
So, now let's have a budget meeting."
It's a solid policy.
Trust me.
I can't find the 8 E.T. tubes.
Yeah, but I need more.
Webber is making me chief of surgery.
That's great, but I got to get these -- wait, what?
Chief?
Wait, chief of surgery?
Ooh, say it again.
Hey, how you doing, man?
This is my wife, Dr. Miranda Bailey,
Chief of surgery.
No, chief of all these damn surgeries.
Oh, I got to get these, uh, in.
Oh, yeah, go, go, go.
Who is the chief?
I am the chief.
Warren, you'll intubate.
Kepner, you and I will do the ex-lap.
Get control of whatever's bleeding.
Grey, I need you and Pierce scrubbed and ready
in the O.R. When we get there, we got it?
Okay.
Meredith, do me a favor.
Tell Joanie that I loved her and that I --
No. No, no, no.
No messages from beyond the grave, Keith.
We're not doing that.
It's okay.
You guys have been great.
You went way above and beyond.
Keith, yes, a lot of people here
are working very hard to pull this off,
and you have to work, too, okay?
I've seen the looks on these people's faces.
This is not gonna work.
Hunt, I'm gonna need a minute.
Okay.
I'm serious -- one minute, that's all I'm allowing.
It's too soon.
Fine, fine.
You talk to Wilson yet about me and the kids moving in?
No. I was a jackass, and now she's not even talking to me.
I can't even -- - Is she moving out?
Is there room for Amelia,
because you could take your old room,
I could take my old room back,
and then Amelia could move into Cristina's room.
God, Mer, what the hell?
I know, I know,
but I hurt her feelings, and she's mad at me.
I forgot I'm supposed to be her sister.
You're a complete tool sometimes.
I've heard.
All right, everybody stop what you're doing.
Quiet, please. Make a hole. Make a hole.
Let them through, guys.
I have something for you.
Hey, big man.
Look at you.
I'm sorry for all this crap.
Sorry, I just...wish I...
I'm gonna see you when I get out of here, okay?
You and your mom, yeah?
I'm gonna be there and we're gonna be together, okay?
Oh, I love you. Daddy loves you.
Kiss.
Okay, okay.
All right, let's bag him.
Push 200 of ketamine.
Don't go.
No.
I'm right here.
That was a bad idea bringing him out here like that.
Why?
Because I'm gonna be really pissed...
if you don't pull this off.
Me too.
That was a really nice idea.
Oh, well, it wasn't mine, but I'll take credit.
Look, I was being a jerk.
Shut up.
I know. We were both jerks.
Can we just move on?
Please.
Good.
So, I have to ask you something.
Okay.
Meredith asked me if she could move in.
She's selling her house and she wants to move in.
What do you think?
With the kids?
No, she's selling the kids with the house.
Yes, with the kids.
And I get a vote on this?
I didn't think that we did that.
I thought we were at this place
where you just told me what was gonna happen.
I'm asking you.
Yeah, and I can say no to the sad widow
with the three kids tapping on the window?
You said you were putting down roots here.
Congrats.
Now you got a house and a family.
So, I guess the wedding is off.
Yeah, what happened?
Did Richard talk to you?
No.
Was a complete surprise.
Complete surprise.
Are you okay?
I'm fine. I'm fine.
Feels familiar, huh?
Feels great, actually.
You miss it?
Being in the field?
It's the only thing I ever think about.
Sats and B.P. are stable. Good to go.
Here we go.
Okay.
All right, laps. More laps.
Scissors.
Kelly. Kelly.
Looks like
it's going straight into his renal vessels.
Clamp.
I can't reach. Can you get it?
Uh, I got it. I got it. Crap! Crap!
No, I-I see it. I see it.
Okay, all right.
Damn it. Laps.
Okay. Gonna need a whole lot more laps!
Doctors Hunt and Kepner start Keith's surgery
outside in the car.
Doctors grey and Pierce are standing by in the O.R.
waiting to finish that surgery.
You need to help get Keith from the car to the O.R.
We estimate we have less than three minutes
to get him from car to O.R.
Any more than that, he dies.
You make a mistake, he dies.
This has to be perfect. We have one chance.
There are no do-overs.
His life and death depends
on how you handle the next few minutes.
Do not mess this up.
Come on, come on, come on.
His chest wall is hashed.
Now, can you get that last clamp?
I got it. I got it. I got it.
You, keep these doors open.
You stay on this corner here.
All right, what's your name?
Uh, Deluca.
All right, Deluca, right here.
You got it.
That's it. Let's go.
Warren, watch the clamps when they pull the piece out of him.
Kepner, be ready to pack. Are we ready?
Ready.
I'm good.
If this guy's not on the table in five minutes,
this was all for nothing.
I'm starting the clock.
Let's all be careful, okay?
And go.
All right. What is your name?
Shaw.
Shaw, this elevator does not move
until our patient is inside. Got it?
Easy, easy.
All right, give them room.
Let's go.
Incoming!
Out of here! Clear the hall!
Go!
No! No! No!
Sorry. Sorry. Move, move.
Move!
Get out! Get out! Get out!
Incoming! Move!
Just wait. Wait. Wait, wait.
Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on!
Move!
Who's on the elevator?
Why is it closed?!
Get it open!
MOVE!
Out! Out! Out! Out!
What happened?
He coded in the elevator!
Come on.
Ready? One, two, three.
All right. Let's get him back.
Hang some more blood. Paddles.
Push an amp of bicarb. Clear.
We have sinus.
Okay, we got this?
Yeah, we got it. Go.
Okay. Gonna have to open up his chest.
Get me a thoracotomy tray and scalpel.
Got a pumper here, Jackson.
Right angle...
Come on, Keith. Come on.
Here you go, doctor.
He's still alive?
For now.
And the girlfriend?
Out of surgery.
Awake. Not paralyzed.
Excellent work.
Meredith told you she's selling the house?
What, her house?
Yeah.
It was news to me, too.
Where are you gonna go?
I'll find something.
Maybe she'll let you keep the trailer.
Well, maybe I should just get a house
that doesn't get parking tickets.
Come on.
You won't miss being able to reach your toaster from your toilet?
I might.
I really want this to work.
Yeah?
This family.
Uh, all three of them.
Right. Right.
What did you think I meant?
Oh, nothing, no.
That. Yeah.
Me too.
Jo!
Jo, come here.
The sad widow is my friend -- my best friend.
And I-I don't want to piss you off
and I don't want you running off somewhere,
but I-I can't say no to her.
So, you're saying no to me. Okay.
No.
Look, all that crap I said about building a life here
and about putting down roots -- look, I meant with you.
I want a house with you, my career with you.
Uh, maybe someday a dog, maybe.
It's all supposed to be with you.
I th-- I thought you got that.
I didn't think I needed to say it.
So, when I say that I can't say no to my friend,
it doesn't mean I'm saying no to you.
I want you and all of it with you.
Okay.
Where are you going?
I just...
I have to think about what I want.
Vitals are steady.
We may actually pull this out.
This will make a hell of a wedding story.
Hey, what is going on with your mom and Richard?
Ah, same old crap.
Clash of the titans.
What?
They both want to be boss.
Both want to dig in,
and my mom is the smartest person in the room.
She's used to it.
She's used to everybody knowing
that she's the smartest person in the room.
So, when you challenge her, it's world war iii.
And Richard is the same.
Well, that is just ridiculous and pathetic.
I mean, you don't just shrug your shoulders and call it quits.
You find a way to work through it.
You don't just...
Give up and throw it all away like it was nothing.
Oh, oh. Wow. Uh, I'm sorry.
It's something else. She doesn't want to talk about it.
Don't look at me. Ignore me.
Welcome to the family.
Thank you, doctor.
I have something for you. Thank you.
It's my old cellphone.
There's one voicemail on it.
Password is 1515.
And make sure you're alone when you listen to it.
Who does the post-anesthesia checks?
Shut up.
Isn't rounds when we're supposed to ask questions?
I thought you weren't allowed to go near that patient.
Did I not just say shut up?
Hi, Joan.
It's Dr. Edwards.
Give my hands a squeeze?
They fixed me up.
Can you squeeze a little harder for me on your right?
I am as hard as I can.
I can't really breathe.
Her sats are dropping pretty fast.
What's happening?
Shaw, bag her.
Get a crash cart and an intubation tray in here now.
Don't take that off. I did that. You don't want to -- oh.
She's hemorrhaging. Blood's compressing her trachea.
Gloves! Gloves!
She's losing her airway.
Scalpel.
Page Shepherd and Torres.
Betadine.
Scalpel now.
Sats back up to 93, 95.
What happened?
Looks like a leaking carotid pseudoaneurysm.
What about her right side?
Will she get her motor function back?
I'm more worried about brain death at this point.
She can easily throw a clot
and have a massive hemispheric stroke.
Well, it's a good thing that you caught it.
No, Edwards. Edwards did.
Dr. Edwards, is there any chance
the leak could cause permanent da--
Will you hush?
Just sit back there and stay silent.
Edwards!
What?
These are your ducklings.
I'm sor-- what?
Today is the first day of your new job,
and you have failed gloriously.
You are a teacher. Now, these interns are yours.
They're your ducklings, and you're letting them drown!
Well, I want them to drown.
I want to watch it.
Well, you can't.
You have to teach them how to paddle their stupid feet
and stay above the water.
They're going to screw up.
And it will never be their fault.
It will always be your fault.
But how you teach them will determine
how they treat patients for years to come.
They're your web-footed legacy,
and they're brilliant students.
Hand-selected for this program by doctors wiser than you,
and they're your responsibility.
Raise your ducklings.
What is the matter with you two?
My husband is dead.
Yeah, I'm gonna play that card.
You.
You walked away from Ellis, never got to be with her,
and now she's dead.
Adele is dead.
And you -- I don't know who's dead for you.
But the both of you are very, very much alive
and breathing and driving each other crazy.
And you yell and argue and fight,
and you both should be thrilled to be able to do those things.
I would give anything to be able to do those things.
And none of those things are reason enough
to not be with the person that you love,
especially when there just isn't enough.
There will never be enough time.
And you both know that.
So whatever it is that that's coming between you two,
Will you just please figure it out?
Figure it out.
It's amazing anyone survived this.
you should be proud of yourself.
It was a little ballsy, huh?
It was, actually, and you loved it.
And I don't know why you're upset.
Because I need to say something,
and I don't know how to say it.
I don't even want to say it.
You want to go back.
There's another plane going to Jordan in a couple weeks,
and you...
And you want to be on it.
The way I felt today,
every day is like it out there.
I thought it was just readjustment,
and then I thought it was, like,
an adrenaline addiction or something,
but it feels like...
I don't know, I --
I feel like I've been called, Jackson.
Well, maybe you should go back.
Really?
When we lost Samuel,
a light went out in you, and I miss it.
I miss it so much.
And whatever it was over there,
you know, whatever it is, it got relit.
Thank you.
Wait. Wait.
April, I love you so much.
But I don't think I can be here when you come back.
You understand?
What?
What? Why?
No.
It's only gonna be a couple of months.
It's not gonna be a year.
No.
I-I promise I'll d--
No.
You don't know what I've been through this last year.
This last year, what it was like...
I -- I know.
I -- it was -- it was hard. - I know.
What do you mean you know? You don't know.
You never asked.
Not once, in fact.
How was I doing?
How was I coping?
You didn't even ask.
I'm sorry.
S-- god, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
You know -- but we talked.
Yeah, you know what? And --
You've got to have your life-altering journey, okay?
And I stayed behind.
And I held stuff down.
And I silenced myself so that you could grieve.
If you need to grieve, we can --
I did! I did need to grieve.
I needed to -- needed to with you.
That's what marriage is to me, april.
So, um...
Okay, so you're saying that if I go --
If I go again, then we're done?
You're just calling it?
Squeeze my fingers.
Good.
Very good.
My baby -- is my baby okay?
He's doing just fine.
And Keith? Is he...
I'm right here.
You're here?
I'm here.
I'm looking right at you.
I saw our baby.
He's beautiful. He's so beautiful.
He looks exactly like me.
Don't make me laugh.
It hurts.
Okay, but research budgets
are approved by one department head,
not a committee.
Agreed. Next point.
I have a say in all the residency candidates.
Rejected. Never gonna happen.
I gave you Valentine's day!
If I have to celebrate valentine's day,
I get to review the prospective residents.
And give a recommendation.
Nothing more.
I have final say.
That's fair.
Next point.
Miranda Bailey is the next chief of surgery.
Miranda Bailey
is judged against an outside candidate of my choosing.
Then the board votes based on merit.
That's...
That's fair.
Agreed. Next point.
Now...
When we're at home, we are not at work.
We leave work at the hospital.
Rejected. Totally unrealistic.
Richard, our schedules -- Come on!
Hey, I understand,
But we need some time for each o--
The bedroom.
No work in the bedroom.
Next point.
I will provide a safe harbor.
What does that mean?
You need a place
to not be Catherine Avery...
To not be decisive and set agendas
and rise to the level of accomplishments
that the world has come to expect of you.
You need a place to fall apart.
I will be that place...
...should you require it...
...in perpetuity.
Richard, do you take Catherine to be your wife
for as long as you both shall live?
I do.
And, Catherine?
I do. I do, forever.
Then by the power vested in me by the state of Washington,
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
Hey, bottoms up, plastics pals--
Let's just enjoy the party, huh?
Where's Kepner?
I don't know.
Where have you been?
Come with me. I want to show you something.
Oh, congratulations, chief!
Thank you, thank you.
Uh, and speaking of chief, um...
I, uh, had a talk with Catherine,
and there is going to be, um...
I don't know how to say this, but --
You have got to be kidding me.
You're running just against one other candidate,
but you're gonna have it.
Ju-- sir, I understand, but it's just not fair.
Well, actually, it's the only fair way --
No, no, no -- to this other candidate,
because I am going to wipe the floor with her...or him.
It's gonna hurt.
Getting trounced hurts,
and it'll be embarrassing, publicly and professionally,
losing by that wide a margin,
because I am primed for this job, sir.
I deserve this job.
There isn't a single person in this room
who would d-d--
Disagree.
...disagree that I am not so ready for this job.
It's already mine.
Damn right it is.
Pardon me, dear, but Dr. Webber
has a couple of moves I haven't seen yet.
I love you.
Why are we here?
It's a loft space.
Jo, it's a crime scene.
Stop! Stop it. You're ruining it.
Someone beat me to that.
Oh, shut up!
It's all I can afford.
I took everything --
all my savings, everything that I had --
and it was almost enough to cover the whole thing.
Wait. You're buying this?
Well, um...
we are, if you want to pitch in.
I put in an offer.
Sell Meredith her house back...
Because this is what I want...
our own place, for us.
And and, um, I just --
I saw this place,
and I thought that we could make it anything...?
Whatever we want...
...because I love you.
And I love living with you.
But we should just...
We should have our own place.
Just us.
If you want that.
If that's -- if that's what you want, too.
You've never said that.
Said what?
"I love you."
I didn't think that I had to.
Patient presented in labor with a fracture at C5-6.
Radioulnar fracture was reduced in the field.
Post-op, she bled from a carotid pseudoaneurysm...
...which was repaired with an arteriotomy and a patch.
Patient now shows no neuro deficits
and is expected to make a full recovery.
Questions.
Would the chance for recovery have been different...
Are high-dose steroids
still indicated for immediate treatment?
I know.
I know. I do.
Oh. Sorry. I was just...
You all right?
I was just about to listen to a message.
But I can't...
seem to bring myself to hit play.
Hey, it's me.
I'm on the ferry.
I-I just wanted to say that, um...
...god, I wish you could see this.
Weather's classic Seattle.
Oh, the water is so blue.
It may be the most perfect ferryboat ride
I've ever had in my life.
We're gonna do this a lot more when I get home,
by the way -- you, me, and the family.
We're just gonna take a day and...
ride the ferryboat -- all day if we want.
I love you, Meredith.
I know I just left, and I'm not even at the airport yet,
but I just wanted to say...
I love you.
I love our family.
And we're gonna keep doing this.
I'll see you when I get home.
I love you.
You okay?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I am.
What is wrong?
And don't say you're fine.
Nothing. I'm fine.
What -- did somebody die?
My parents are getting a divorce.
My mom called and told me today.
She's been having an affair
with the man that services their cars...
for 11 years.
He's been servicing their cars and my mom.
And my dad found out about it years ago, and he was enraged,
and he stuck with it for me, because I was...
I was still in town.
I was always around.
You know, so they held it together for the kid.
Classic. Except the kid's a grown woman.
They wanted to preserve my...
happy, idyllic...
...pathetic, crap-filled lie of a childhood!
Why didn't you tell me?
I...
Your husband died,
and I am crying like a 7-year-old over mommy and daddy. I...
I didn't grow up like you. I...
I've never lost anyone.
I never even had a cat die.
I still have all my grandparents.
There's no darkness in my life.
Just, I've never had it.
So I-I'm not gonna come talk to you about it.
Well, you should always come talk to me...
Because whatever it is, chances are, I've seen worse,
and I am qualified to tell you how you'll survive.
You should always come and talk to me.
What are you crying about?
What are you crying about?
Derek would have loved this.
He came from this big, noisy family.
I want this to be my last memory of this house.
That's what he wanted -- to fill it with noise and people.
You can build a house out of anything,
make it as strong as you want.
Okay. We have to dance it out.
What?
What does that mean?
Let's go.
But a home...
A home is more fragile than that.
A home is made of the people you fill it with.
And people can be broken. Sure.
But any surgeon knows...
...what's broken can be mended.
...What's hurt can be healed.
That no matter how dark it gets...
...the sun's gonna rise again.
