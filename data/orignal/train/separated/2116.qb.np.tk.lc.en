hey , luke , over here !
dude , where the hell have you been ?
luke , finally . what took you so long ?
i was busy , okay ?
lighten up , man .
probably fighting with emily again .
so where is she anyway ?
grounded .
seriously ? why ?
there is no why . her dad &apos;s mental .
something must &apos;ve made him go all guantanamo on her .
hey , let &apos;s go liberate her . come on !
courtney , leave it alone .
you &apos;ll just get her in more trouble .
besides , her dad hates me enough already .
fine , you stay here .
jake , no ! you &apos;ll wake up her dad .
yeah , i &apos;m gonna wake him up ?
i was aiming for her window .
which one &apos;s hers ?
up there . the one that &apos;s kind of open .
that one ?
oh , my god , seriously ?
what ?
emily ?
shh !
okay , &quot; boo &quot; on three .
one ... two ... three .
boo !
boo !
emily , wake up !
hey , joe .
thought you might need a ride .
it was your second trip to japan in two months .
what can i say ?
i &apos;m a sucker for karaoke .
something on your mind ?
hiro noshimuri .
hpd has evidence that he was murdered , joe .
now , i &apos;m not directly involved with the investigation ,
but i &apos;m told they &apos;re starting to look at you .
i did not kill hiro noshimuri .
we had a conversation ,
and when it was over , he walked away .
if he &apos;s dead ,
hpd should be looking at wo fat
why would wo fat want to kill the head of the yakuza ?
shelburne .
did noshimuri tell you who shelburne is ?
no , but wo fat might think otherwise .
the problem is , you were the one
who was seen taking noshimuri at gunpoint .
hpd isn &apos;t gonna just let this go .
apparently , neither is the yakuza . we got company .
hang on !
hey , what have we got ?
victim &apos;s a 17 @-@ year @-@ old girl , emily winter .
m.e. thinks that she was smothered
with a pillow from her own bed .
17 years old , what does that make her ,
a junior in high school ?
yeah . ala moana academy .
i hate this job .
yeah . bruising on her wrists .
like she was restrained .
probably pinned down .
what &apos;s the time of death on this ?
emily &apos;s dad saw her 10 : 30 p.m.
when she came to her bedroom ,
and her friends found her here at around 1 : 00 a.m.
her dad was here ?
yeah , he was here all night . he didn &apos;t hear a thing .
no sign of forced entry , but we have an open window .
easy access in and out .
hopefully , the killer left evidence .
yeah , but even if he did ,
it might not still be there ; it turns out
this window was more popular than the front door .
the kids who found her snuck in through it .
they also told a uni that emily was supposed to be
at a party last night , but she didn &apos;t show
&apos;cause she was grounded , but they don &apos;t know why .
those kids still here ?
they &apos;re on the lanai . i was just about to go talk to them .
good . what about her dad ?
i never thought i &apos;d say this ...
i &apos;m glad her mother didn &apos;t live to see this day .
she died of cancer when emily was ten .
i &apos;m sorry .
is there , uh , anyone i can call or anything i can do ?
my sister &apos;s coming over .
she &apos;s ... on her way .
emily was everything to me .
she always looked at the world with a smile ...
no matter what .
smart , too .
she had a full acamic schorship at ala moana .
she sounds like a very special girl .
excuse me . sir , i &apos;m steve mcgarrett , five @-@ o.
i &apos;m very sorry for your loss .
thank you .
i just need to ask you a couple questions if that &apos;s okay .
sir , can you think of anybody
who &apos;d want to do something like this to your daughter ?
no .
no , everyone loved emily .
everyone .
she &apos;d never been in any kind of trouble
except ...
except what ?
she &apos;d never done anything like this before , ever .
a couple of weeks ago , she @-@ she stole a check from my wallet .
she made it out to cash :
$ 5,000 .
did you ... did you confront her ?
she admitted taking it ,
but she refused to say why .
she wouldn &apos;t tell you what the money was for ?
she said she needed it to help a friend ;
i &apos;m sure it had something to do with luke .
and who is luke ?
luke is her boyfriend .
he &apos;s arrogant , he &apos;s , he &apos;s entitled .
i wouldn &apos;t put it past him to convince emily to steal for him .
all right , we should really check out the boyfriend .
come on . really , i mean , what father actually likes
his daughter &apos;s high school boyfriend ?
what are you talking about ? my dad did .
no , he didn &apos;t .
yeah , he did . my mom , too . he &apos;s great .
what was he , a eunuch ?
hey , listen . according to the kids who found emily ,
her and her boyfriend luke had been fighting .
about what , they don &apos;t know .
what we do know is that luke was supposed to be
at a party on the beach last night ,
but he didn &apos;t show up until almost midnight .
yeah , and he also didn &apos;t show up here with the other kids .
he actually tried to talk them out of coming .
okay , we need to check this guy out .
kono .
yeah , got it . thanks .
okay , so we got a hit off one of the prints off emily &apos;s window :
luke preston . kid &apos;s got a record .
okay , now i do want to talk .
luke , get out here now !
is he in trouble ?
we just want to ask him a couple questions .
he &apos;ll be right out .
luke , now !
he &apos;s a good boy .
spirited , but a good boy .
mrs. preston , we know he has a record .
oh , that ? that was a family thing .
luke borrowed the porsche without permission ,
so i called the cops , you know , just to teach him a lesson .
he &apos;s 18 , so it went on his record .
you do realize using law enforcement
as a disciplinary tool is a bad idea , right ?
hey , luke !
luke , open the door !
call 911 !
this is officer kalakaua . i need an ambulance now .
come on , luke ! come on !
how &apos;s luke ?
well , he &apos;s awake now . doc says we can go see him .
he said he od &apos;d on a combination
of alcohol and benzodiazepine .
they pumped his stomach .
is he gonna be okay ?
yeah . he &apos;s a lucky kid .
it was stupid .
i was upset and drunk .
and then this morning , i , uh ...
i got a text from jake .
about emily .
and i just flipped out , and ...
you know , grabbed some pills from my mom &apos;s stash ,
and that &apos;s when you showed up .
is it true ?
is she really dead ?
that &apos;s why we &apos;re here .
i can &apos;t believe it .
would you believe it
if i told you i found your prints on her windowsill ?
i used to sneak into her bedroom
through that window all the time .
her dad was completely oblivious .
that what happened last night ?
look , man ...
hey , &quot; sir , &quot; all right ? you call me sir .
you got that ?
look , it &apos;s not what you think .
you fight with emily last night ?
do i need a lawyer ?
that girl is dead . you answer my question .
did you fight with her last night ?
yes .
but i didn &apos;t hurt her .
i would never hurt her .
you know about the money emily stole from her father ?
that &apos;s what we were fighting about .
did she steal the money for you ?
no ! no .
that &apos;s what her dad thought , but it wasn &apos;t true .
i didn &apos;t need $ 5,000 .
okay ? and even if i did , i &apos;d steal it from my own parents .
trust me , they &apos;d never notice .
all right , so who was the money for ?
she wouldn &apos;t tell me .
she wouldn &apos;t tell anybody .
well , you can &apos;t blame emily &apos;s dad for not liking this kid .
really ? i kind of liked him .
what , are you kidding me ?
he really seemed to care about emily .
anyway , i don &apos;t like him for the murder .
he doesn &apos;t strike me as the type who &apos;d kill with his bare hands .
we need to find out who that money was for .
emily &apos;s locker 279 .
it should be up here on the left .
wow , this ... this is high school , right ?
i mean , this has me feeling very nostalgic .
mm . i hated high school .
you ?
you seem like the smart type , right ?
like the president of the student council .
what , you think i was like tracy flick ?
that was a compliment .
oh , i &apos;m sure you were , like , a jock .
no , no , but i , uh , i did chase all the cheerleaders .
what are we looking for ?
if anybody &apos;s gonna know what &apos;s going on with emily ,
it &apos;s this girl . we gotta get a name .
mr. summers is the headmaster . we &apos;ll go talk to him .
at the front , they said he &apos;s doing an assembly .
come on . okay .
the days and weeks ahead are going to be very difficult .
loss is never easy , and , uh ...
a loss like this , it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s not something we &apos;re ever fully prepared to accept .
so ... we have counselors , teachers and staff
standing by to help you through the grieving process
any way that we can . 24 / 7 .
a tragedy has struck at the heart of our community ,
but we will get through this ...
together .
so , if you feel like
you need to speak to a counselor now , please do .
otherwise , please proceed to your class .
that &apos;s it , guys . dismissed .
hey . mr. summers . i &apos;m danny williams .
lori weston . we &apos;re with five @-@ o.
we &apos;re investigating emily &apos;s homicide .
she was a great kid .
had her whole life ahead of her .
straight a &apos;s , no attitude , no trouble .
any idea who did this to her , or ... ?
no , but we were , um , hoping you could help us with this .
do you know who this girl is ?
that &apos;s , uh , karen sargent .
she and emily are inseparable--
bffs , as the kids say today .
all right . well , we &apos;re going to need to speak to her ,
if that &apos;s okay .
sure .
i &apos;ll , uh , pull her out of class as soon as i call her father .
actually , we &apos;d , um , we &apos;d like to
speak to her alone , if that &apos;s okay .
she &apos;s not a suspect , or anything like that ;
we just need to talk to her .
but she is a minor .
i am required to notify a parent .
okay .
anything you have to say to karen , you can say to me .
so ... go ahead .
okay . uh ...
so , karen , we know about the money that
emily stole from her father .
what money ?
it was $ 5,000 .
emily wouldn &apos;t tell her father what it was for ,
but we &apos;re hoping karen will .
i don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
karen , emily was your best friend ,
and she was murdered .
okay ? we think it might have something
to do with who the money was for .
she just said she doesn &apos;t know anything about it .
okay , sir , please . just give her a second .
i know that you and emily were close .
and i know that you want to do the right thing .
so , please , just tell us everything you know .
okay , that &apos;s it . she &apos;s been through enough .
let &apos;s go .
the yakuza knows hpd is circling joe .
they were sending a message .
steve , joe &apos;s in real trouble .
okay . i &apos;ll reach out to adam noshimuri . he &apos;s in charge now .
maybe you should reach out to joe .
joe told me he didn &apos;t kill hiro .
okay . i know you trust him ...
of course i trust him .
i mean , he &apos;s like a father to me .
when my father wasn &apos;t around , he was . for years .
but that was a long time ago , steve .
people change .
how much do you really know
about his life over the last ten years ?
he saved my life , chin .
more than once .
i get that . i do .
but i &apos;m telling you , he &apos;s hiding something .
why does he keep going to japan ?
what does he really know about shelburne ?
and do you really believe he didn &apos;t kill hiro noshimuri ?
i &apos;m just saying you might not know the whole story .
hey , guys . you need to see this .
i got something off emily &apos;s computer .
so ... i know who the $ 5,000 was for .
karen sargent .
she sent a frantic e @-@ mail to emily a couple weeks ago ,
saying she was being blackmailed .
blackmailed for what ?
for this .
it &apos;s a screen grab from a sex tape .
the blackmailer said that he would
post the video online if she didn &apos;t pony up $ 5,000 .
karen was terrified her parents would find out .
all right , guys .
emily gave the money to a friend of hers , karen sargent .
karen &apos;s the one emily was protecting ?
yeah , she was being blackmailed over a sex tape .
we just tried to talk to karen ;
she was a brick wall .
well , now you know why .
we &apos;ve got eyes on her now .
all right , listen , we have an id on the blackmailer yet ?
not yet . it might be the guy she was having sex with .
maybe he made the sex tape
without her consent , and then used it
to try and squeeze some cash out of her .
wait a minute . why would karen be protecting this guy ?
especially if he killed her best friend ?
well , if she &apos;s in love with the guy ,
she might be in denial .
yeah , because he &apos;s such a lovable guy .
you have obviously never been a 17 @-@ year @-@ old girl .
all right , listen . here &apos;s the problem .
if we go back to karen ,
her father &apos;s gonna get a lawyer .
okay , she might not be talking to us or her dad ,
but she &apos;s gotta be talking to somebody .
and i &apos;m thinking it &apos;s the blackmailer .
okay . she &apos;s going for her phone right now .
hold up , hold up , hold up .
what are you doing ?
getting the cell interceptor .
it &apos;ll pick up the number she &apos;s dialing .
where did you get that ?
in the trunk .
how &apos;d you know that thing was in there ?
how did you not know it was in there ?
okay . number is : 808- 555 @-@ 0136 .
okay , i &apos;m running it now .
um ... okay , so it &apos;s assigned to a prepaid cell .
no name .
but i &apos;m activating gps .
all right , we got a location on the phone .
looks like whoever karen is talking to is in a vehicle .
the guy &apos;s on the move , okay ? so let &apos;s go . let &apos;s go , let &apos;s go !
hey . out of the car with your hands up .
out of the car .
what &apos;s going on ?
i want a lawyer .
you ...
want a lawyer ?
i want to bound your head off this cement wall .
how &apos; bout i get what i want and you don &apos;t ?
what do you think ?
he can &apos;t do this .
no ?
looks to me like he can , actually .
i haven &apos;t done anything wrong .
okay , uh ... this is where we disagree .
okay , i think that sleeping with little girls
is definitely wrong .
it &apos;s not what you think .
no ?
karen is 17 years old .
age of consent in hawaii is 16 .
she &apos;s legal .
can i hit him once ? please ?
shut your mouth , all right ?
what happened ?
emily find out about your little affair ?
is that what happened ? is that why you killed her ?
no !
is that why you killed her ? !
i didn &apos;t kill her !
okay , emily knew about my relationship with karen ,
but she wasn &apos;t going to tell anyone .
how do you know that ?
because she came to see me .
she told me i had to
break it off with karen , but because somebody else knew .
wait a minute . emily confronted you like that ?
yes . she said ... she had to protect karen ,
that it was something she felt like she had to do , and ...
it was a couple days later , after that ,
i got an e @-@ mail demanding money .
okay , so you &apos;re saying you were being blackmailed as well .
there was a tape .
at first i thought karen made it ,
but she was just as mortified by it as i was .
okay , so wait a minute . you didn &apos;t make the tape .
karen didn &apos;t make ... who made the tape ?
i don &apos;t know .
but i think emily figured out who it was .
and i think she confronted him
just like she confronted me ...
and then he killed her .
mcgarrett .
what ?
i &apos;ll be right there .
what do you mean , you need more evidence ?
i &apos;m telling you i saw joe white take my father at gunpoint .
last time i checked , that &apos;s kidnapping .
guys . thanks for the call .
where &apos;s he at ? he at the back ?
hey . hey . why are you protecting him ?
i &apos;m here to see a friend .
okay ?
well , your friend killed my father .
you got proof of that ?
look , we both know what happened .
you just don &apos;t want to believe it .
give me a minute ?
yeah , sure .
you gotta come clean with these guys .
i mean , you know that , right ?
you gotta tell them everything .
what is it you want me to tell them ?
why you went to see noshimuri ...
why you were the last person seen with him
before he disappeared .
you &apos;re interfering with something
that you don &apos;t understand .
then why don &apos;t you explain it to me , joe ? !
tell me what the hell &apos;s going on !
you gotta wake up .
the walls are closing in on you .
hpd wants answers ,
the yakuza wants blood .
shelburne-- is he worth this ? huh ?
is he worth going to jail for ?
is he worth dying for , joe ?
people already died , son .
i &apos;m trying to make it stop !
i &apos;m getting out of here . cops got nothing on me .
you gonna give me a ride ,
or do i have to call a cab ?
i figured out how that sex tape was made ,
and how your anonymous blackmailer accessed it .
summers &apos; computer was infected with spyware
that remotely activated its webcam .
as simple as that ?
pretty much . the spyware was a trojan horse
attached to a file containing
the ala moana academy &apos;s &quot; lookbook . &quot;
it &apos;s kind of like a digital yearbook .
okay , so summers downloaded the lookbook ,
and then ...
and then he and karen must &apos;ve had sex
in view of the laptop &apos;s camera .
and neither one of them knew they were being watched ,
or recorded .
that &apos;s really creepy .
moral of the story :
resist the urge to have sex in front of an open laptop .
sometimes you scare me .
the other thing is ...
i got an ip address for the blackmail e @-@ mails .
they both trace back to the computer lab
at ala moana academy . not sure if that helps .
you know what , it might .
when i was in high school , we had to sign in
to use the school computers .
thanks , fong .
we got your name from the sign @-@ in sheet ,
and we were wondering if you can remember
who was using that computer right before you .
yeah , someone signed in using a bogus name ,
so we just need to talk to him .
oh , man , that &apos;s totally lame .
i have a pretty good memory , &apos; cause i &apos;m a journalist--
editor of the school paper and all that--
but that was finals week .
it &apos;s all kind of a blur .
i remember i was just glad to snag a computer at all .
place was packed .
oh , yeah . i &apos;ve , uh ... seen this thing around .
what is this ?
it &apos;s just this thing called the lookbook .
it &apos;s nothing ... it &apos;s just this thing that has pictures
of all the students on it .
cool . where &apos;d you get it ?
made it .
uh , jared , we &apos;re gonna have to ask you to come down to hq ...
oh , come on . really ? is he serious ?
i knew i shouldn &apos;t have upped my asking price to ten grand .
who ratted me out ?
exactly how many people are you blackmailing ?
right now , about seven or eight . things pick up around exams .
you &apos;d be surprised how many cheating ,
sex @-@ crazed drug addicts are at my school .
there was a laptop on the desk in emily winter &apos;s bedroom .
yeah , do you know if she download the lookbook ?
yeah , i had a live feed
on her computer , but i stopped monitoring it .
that chick was a total snoozefest .
all she ever did in her bedroom was her homework .
and sleep .
okay . emily was murdered in her bedroom .
she was ?
man , if i &apos;d known that ...
wait , can you pull up the footage from the night she was killed ?
yeah .
fast @-@ forward . i &apos;ll tell you when to stop .
whoa , whoa , whoa .
slow down .
okay .
oh , my god .
this killer &apos;s organized ,
cold , efficient ... not the work of a kid .
no . more like a professional hit .
okay , stop .
i ran him through every facial recognition database
i could find , and i got a hit with interpol .
killer &apos;s name is michael angelico .
i &apos;ve heard of this cat .
he &apos;s like a hit man for the mob .
no . angelico was never affiliated
with any particular crime family .
he &apos;s just a hired gun .
he was on a dod watch list ,
suspected in five or six hits over the last two decades .
never been arrested .
we came across his work in chechnya .
he &apos;s good at what he does .
the best . according to sources at the time ,
his fee started at $ 250,000 and went up from there .
okay , none of this makes sense .
who hires a hit man to kill a teenage girl ?
well , it doesn &apos;t look like angelico &apos;s
gonna be able to answer that question for us .
according to tsa , he &apos;s in the wind .
left two hours after emily &apos;s murder on a flight to manila .
i &apos;ve got the surveillance footage here .
that &apos;s him .
stop right there . stop , stop .
push in on the boarding pass .
name on the ticket is david savage .
all right , so homeboy &apos;s got an alias .
okay , let &apos;s use this to track hotel reservations ,
car rentals ... anything else we can think of
that will help us retrace his steps
while he was on the island , okay ?
he may be gone , but this might help us figure out
who hired him .
we &apos;ve got to get back to emily &apos;s dad .
want any help ?
no . uh ...
why don &apos;t you just head back to your place , keep a low profile .
i &apos;ll call you later . okay ?
i &apos;ve never seen him before in my life .
you &apos;re telling me that this is the man who killed my daughter ?
a hit man ?
yes , sir .
i don &apos;t understand .
mr. winter , do you , uh ...
do you have any enemies that could do something like this ?
enemies ? guys , i &apos;m a physical therapist .
okay , anything , uh , strange at work lately ?
anything at all ?
no , nothing .
i haven &apos;t even been at work . i &apos;ve been on jury duty .
what , uh ... what was the case that you were on ?
a small civil case . it was ...
a construction worker who broke his leg on the job .
he &apos;s suing for medical expenses , lost wages .
and he won the case ?
i don &apos;t know . it wasn &apos;t over yet .
they were just starting closing arguments ...
when emily died .
the judge , he just let you off , or .. ?
yeah , he was very ... very understanding .
excuse me .
okay , look , i know what you &apos;re thinking ,
but ... really ? a trial over a broken leg ?
i mean , it doesn &apos;t seem like the smoking gun here .
no , you generally don &apos;t hire a hit man for that , but ....
what if this entire case was about forcing a mistrial ?
that was so sad about
juror number seven &apos;s daughter ... what was his name ?
greg winter .
right .
okay , i was under the impression
that something like this would probably cause a mistrial . no ?
no , we just seated an alternate juror in his place .
it was pretty straightforward .
wait a minute ,
is that the defense team ?
i know , can you believe it ?
that &apos;s a lot of lawyers .
hedsten construction-- that &apos;s the defendant--
they pulled out all the stops on this one .
flew all the lawyers in from new york .
morgan , frick &amp; dunne .
bunch of ivy league hotshots .
even sprang for owen sutherland ,
the island &apos;s most expensive jury consultant .
hold on . i thought this case was no big deal .
it isn &apos;t .
it &apos;s a $ 150,000 claim , tops .
but they wouldn &apos;t even talk settlement with my client .
doug was part of a crew on a 16 @-@ unit apartment building .
he broke his leg when the balcony gave way , and ...
they &apos;re claiming he was negligent ,
but come on ...
the balcony fell off the building .
okay . do you have new juror number seven &apos;s name ?
yeah .
ray donovan .
thank you .
well , if angelico rented this car ,
he cleaned it out .
it &apos;s spotless .
yeah . rental agent says they clean all the cars
within 24 hours of return .
they also wipe the gps for customer privacy .
oh , how considerate .
wait a minute . i &apos;m sure our killer appreciates it .
valet stub .
it &apos;s date stamped .
there &apos;s an address .
steve , we got something you need to see .
that &apos;s 4225 kane street .
now , according to the valet stub ,
we found on his car , michael angelico visited someone
in that building when he was on the island .
the only problem is , we don &apos;t know who .
five companies lease office space in that building .
we &apos;ve got two shrinks , an accounting company ,
a day spa and a consulting firm .
wait a second .
this guy . blow him up .
okay , that &apos;s owen sutherland .
we saw him in court today .
yeah , he &apos;s the president and ceo
of sutherland consulting .
that &apos;s right . according to the plaintiff &apos;s attorney ,
he &apos;s the island &apos;s most expensive jury consultant ,
and he &apos;s working for the defense .
that &apos;s gotta be who our killer went to see .
okay , yeah .
but how do we prove it ?
we prove it with juror number seven , the one that filled in for emily &apos;s father .
you mean ray donovan ? we got something on him ?
yeah .
at first glance , guy seems like a normal , working class guy .
no record , nothing strange about his financials .
but his wife , on the other hand , she &apos;s a different story .
she &apos;s a part @-@ time dental hygienist , all right ?
all of a sudden , she receives a $ 50,000 wire to her
personal checking account .
let me guess : the timing of it had something to do with
donovan being seated on the jury .
it came in that same day .
and it all leads back to owen sutherland .
okay . let &apos;s go .
go where ? where we going ?
back to court .
hey , sutherland .
five @-@ o. let &apos;s have a chat .
it &apos;s been a long day , gentlemen .
why don &apos;t you call my office ,
and , uh , we &apos;ll see when we can fit you in .
well , we &apos;re fitting ourselves in right now .
how &apos;s that ?
oh , forgive me , i had no idea it was this urgent .
yeah , it &apos;s urgent .
how &apos;s the trial going ?
it &apos;s in the jury &apos;s hands .
they started deliberations this afternoon .
must &apos;ve been a relief ...
to get donovan on the jury . right ?
relief ?
he was the alternate juror .
we &apos;re just glad that the judicial process
seems to be working the way it &apos;s supposed to .
oh , by the way , we know that you , you met with david savage .
oh , sorry ... you called him michael ?
excuse me , i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
you don &apos;t ? you know about the $ 50,000 that landed in
donovan &apos;s wife &apos;s checking account ?
you &apos;re lucky i &apos;m in a good mood ,
otherwise i might take offense at that accusation .
there &apos;s a money trail , and it &apos;s gonna lead back to you .
if you really believe that , you &apos;re delusional .
how do you sleep at night ,
knowing that you murdered a little girl ? huh ?
how much did hedsten pay you to deliver that verdict ?
was it worth it , that blood money ?
we &apos;re done here .
it &apos;s been a pleasure , gentlemen .
see you soon .
we gotta find donovan .
donovan &apos;s not gonna talk .
that depends how we ask the questions .
ray donovan .
who are you ? what do you want ? .
owen sutherland sent us .
he wants to make sure he &apos;s
getting his money &apos;s worth out of you .
i don &apos;t know anyone named sutherland . you got the wrong guy .
oh , we got the right guy .
you know where you are , ray ?
i &apos;ll tell you .
you &apos;re standing on the edge
of an 80 @-@ foot drop down to a rocky shore .
stick your foot out .
please !
put it out .
you feel anything , huh ?
no , please don &apos;t push me !
i &apos;m doing everything sutherland wanted .
like what , ray ? what are you doing ?
i &apos;m making sure no one on the jury &apos;s
looking at the steel .
no one &apos;s even asking any questions about it .
yeah ? what else ?
i &apos;m keeping &apos; em focused
on doug &apos;s safety violations . it &apos;s working .
i swear it &apos;s working . you &apos;ll get your verdict .
that &apos;s great , ray . thanks , buddy .
no ! no !
you &apos;re an animal .
okay .
good news is , you &apos;re alive .
bad news is , you &apos;re under arrest .
book him , danno .
come on .
ray donovan was actually telling the truth
this case is all about the steel .
hedsten is just a subsidiary
of a much larger company called dehavlen construction .
and dehavlen supplied hedsten
with the steel they used in that apartment building .
nothing wrong with that except the steel was supposed
to come from pittsburgh .
dehavlen falsified invoices
and substituted chinese steel .
just pocketed the difference .
you got it .
chinese steel is not only cheaper than the american stuff ,
it can also be substandard .
so what you &apos;re saying is because of bad steel
that the balcony fell off the building .
could mean the whole building is unsound .
here &apos;s the kicker :
hedsten only used five percent
of the steel girders in that load .
five percent ? what &apos;d they do with the rest of it ?
what do you think , $ 800 million ?
easy .
what do you think &apos;s
going to happen when it gets out
that dehavlen &apos;s using substandard steel
to build their city of tomorrow ?
somebody &apos;s gonna take an $ 800 million bath
is what &apos;s gonna happen .
how you doing , man ?
we &apos;re looking for the contractor ,
bob ledford . is he around ?
he &apos;up on the fifth floor talking to a suit .
come on .
you shouldn &apos;t be here .
we need to talk .
about what ?
you can &apos;t keep burying your head in the sand .
look , i &apos;m trying to get a job done here .
it &apos;s over , bob .
you don &apos;t know that .
i am telling you it &apos;s over !
what are you talking about ?
they know about donovan .
about the payoff .
that &apos;s on you !
i never asked you to pay anyone off .
you wanted a guarantee !
i gave it to you !
hey , hey ! five @-@ o ! you &apos;re both under arrest .
let me see both your hands .
you stupid son of a bitch !
h @-@ h @-@ hey ! turn around .
down on your knees now . now !
okay , listen to me .
give me your other hand .
i can &apos;t .
give me your other hand . let me help you .
come on !
give me your hand , come on !
no ! !
just tell me what you did .
admit it !
i did not ...
kill your father .
tell your men to put their guns down right now , adam .
this has nothing to do with you , mcgarrett .
tell your men to put their guns down ,
or i &apos;m gonna put two in your head right now .
it &apos;s your last chance .
untie joe .

let &apos;s go , joe .
you realize you just started a war with the yakuza .
no , joe , you did that
when you grabbed hiro noshimuri , okay ?
they think you killed him .
well , i didn &apos;t kill him .
i helped him fake his death .

joe , jenna kaye paid with her life !
i deserve answers . i want answers .

of insubordination for that .

and you &apos;re not my commanding officer .
you &apos;re right .
