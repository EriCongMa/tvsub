damn , man .
you look tired . your eyes are puffy as hell .
i &apos;m unwell , winston .
i &apos;m just torn up about this whole cece and elizabeth thing .
i feel so guilty , i can &apos;t even look at myself in the mirror .
do you think that i &apos;m good person ?
i &apos;m gonna ...
hey , guys , do you guys think that i &apos;m a good person ?
you &apos;re a terrible person . it &apos;s hilarious .
you cheated on my best friend , schmidt .
f @-@ fair enough . okay . well , i &apos;m better than winston .
you &apos;re better at things than winston , but he &apos;s a better person .
winston freakin &apos; stinks !
okay , why am i being dragged into this ?
because i &apos;m mad , winston .
and i &apos;m tired .
and ... i &apos;m a good ...
i &apos;m a g ... i &apos;m a good man .
are you crying ?
i got a package for nick miller .
there &apos;s nobody here by that name .
i got this .
i saw that .
run , nick ! run !
what ?
relax , i &apos;m with your late father &apos;s estate .
pop @-@ pop ? what ?
this is for him .
what &apos;s in there ?
it &apos;s a hand , isn &apos;t it ? just tell me if it &apos;s a hand .
oh , my god !
it is a hand .
it &apos;s a ... i knew it .
it &apos;s a hand .
what does that mean , though ? what are the odds ?
full of dollar bills , y &apos;all !
you are rich , man !
i can &apos;t believe nick &apos;s dad left him $ 8,000 .
i &apos;ve never seen someone burn through money so fast .
i should say something .
some of these shoes aren &apos;t even his size .
look , jess , you don &apos;t want to talk to nick about money , okay ?
it is a very touchy subject .
i &apos;m gonna check out this fancy picture place .
seems like rich guys always have pictures of themselves .
my man . do you , baby .
i &apos;m gonna be honest with you .
nick owes me 1,900 bucks ,
so this here is my opportunity to get it back .
how are you expecting to get your money back
if he blows it all on stupid stuff ?
oh , don &apos;t worry , jess .
i have a plan .
hey , listen , you know you don &apos;t have to con him
if he actually owes you money . you can just ask him .
i just told you to ask him for the money .
smile ...
do the crystals make it look too glamorous ?
it &apos;s really glamorous .
i don &apos;t even know .
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s cool anymore .
it could be a good time to start a bank account .
yeah , or i could just flush it down the toilet .
it &apos;s not really the same thing , but ...
a bank is just a paper bag but with fancier walls .
that &apos;s all it is . i &apos;m gonna keep my money where my mouth is
um , under my nose .
that saying actually does work .
what is that ?
this is my box .
it &apos;s where i keep all my junk
that i don &apos;t feel like dealing with .
that looks like a lot of bills . it &apos;s ... mostly bills .
like i said , it &apos;s junk .
you know , i &apos;m just brainstorming here ,
but what if you paid some of those bills
with the money you just got ?
yeah . i &apos;m gonna &quot; pay my bill . &quot;
and what &apos;s next ? i &apos;m gonna go to the doctor and get a checkup .
give them $ 500 to check my bones .
you &apos;re being funny .
so , yeah , i was dating both of them at the same time .
i &apos;m a mess . i can &apos;t sleep . i urinate constantly .
i cried the other day listening to a techno song .
my tweets have been extremely literal .
were the girls jewish ?
one indian , one regular . do you want to see a picture ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t even know why you &apos;re here .
you come in and say , &quot; do you have a minute ? &quot;
okay , i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m sorry , rabbi . it &apos;s just that ...
okay , it &apos;s much more simple .
how can i be a better person ?
well , you seem awfully concerned with yourself .
you might want to start thinking about the needs of others .
i think about others all the time .
what @-@ what i can get from them ,
how they can give me pleasure ,
do they have a silly little walk
that i can make fun of ?
no , th @-@ that &apos;s ...
it &apos;s where you actually care about somebody else .
you put their needs ahead of your own .
this is one of the few times that i wish i was catholic .
couple hail marys and i &apos;d be off the hook .
oh , god . whoa .
are you choking ? you &apos;re choking . okay .
uh ... what , are you biking and eating ?
all right , i got you , i got you .
come on ! live ! live !
live , biker !
thank you .
you saved my life .
what ?
you saved my life .
you saved my life .
thank you ... thank you ...
yes .
i did . yes .

yes ! dude !
this is exactly what i needed . oh , my god .
let us rejoice in song .
sh &apos;ma yis &apos;ra &apos;eil
please call 911 .
adonai eloheinu
please call 911 . i &apos;m hurt .
oh , yeah , no , that &apos;s a great idea .
please .
i &apos;m gonna call 911 .
hope you don &apos;t have a dance recital later .
i &apos;m just kidding . don &apos;t look at your legs .
that &apos;s , uh , $ 900 to the parking authority of los angeles .
oh , is it okay to mail cash ?
i &apos;m gonna do it anyway .
all right , it &apos;s on its way .
sliders are beautiful .
i know , man .
i knew you would think that .
i love &apos; em , dude .
that &apos;s why i made &apos; em .
what is that ?
brotherhood . brotherhood , man .
all right , man . i respect you , man , no matter what .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s about , man .
yeah , and , um ...
in the spirit of brotherhood--
just &apos; cause we on that level right now--
i was just thinking yeah .
maybe , i don &apos;t know , um ...
anything , man . shoot .
oh , man .
maybe you can just pay me back that money that you owe me .
remember ? &apos; cause you owe me that money ... ?
uh , nick ? nick ? oh ...
nick ? nick ? hey , nick . nick , nick , nick , nick ... ?
oh , you stink !
um , can we ... ?
you son of ...
you son of a bitch , winston !
that &apos;s what this is about ? !
nick , it &apos;s my money , okay ? !
give it back to me !
i make a little bit of money and you come
slipping out of the &quot; woodword &quot; !
you mean &quot; woodwork &quot; ?
what is &quot; woodwork &quot; ? !
what &apos;s &quot; woodword &quot; ? !
wood ! word ! wood ! word !
that &apos;s where people like you
come crawling out of when people like me have money !
but you owe me that money !
stay out of my damn box is the point , man !
i &apos;m not in your box !
jess gets it , right ?
yeah , what &apos;s ... what the hell , dude ?
i &apos;m gonna go to the bar to blow off some steam .
that &apos;s a great idea . go get loaded .
you deserve it . black out .
you are the only one that i trust around here .
you went through nick &apos;s box .
look , it was so much worse than i thought .
why does he have the deed to an old mercury cougar in there ?
oh , yeah , he lost that .
for crying out loud , where is it ?
we &apos;ve been looking for hours .
it &apos;s done .
what about your car , nick ?
i said it &apos;s done .
i &apos;ll just get the moneney back .
bill collectors s are reasonable people , right ?
that makes sense .
you better keep your mouth shut , winston !
i &apos;ll make you a deal . i &apos;ll keep my mouth shut
if you pay me the money nick owes me .
are you trying to blackmail me ?
you don &apos;t scare me , jess .
how much does nick owe you ?
$ 1,900 .
but what is money anyway ?
you know , it &apos;s just paper that some king on the mountains
said was worth something .
you know ? gold , i understand .
it &apos;s shiny and you can make jewelry out of it .
silver ?
put a werewolf in front of me , he &apos;s dead .
brass creates the bells
that make sound throughout the land .
but we kill each other for paper .
i gotta tell you , man , that &apos;s sad .
you give me $ 50 , i &apos;ll show you my private parts .
nicholas , good yontef .
are you well ?
no , but good yontef .
you know , i &apos;m all steamed up .
this money thing is tearing me apart , schmidt .
all right , well , if it &apos;s bothering you that much ,
why don &apos;t you just give it away ?
son of a bitch !
not , not to me , nick , to charity ,
or tzedakah as my people call it .
that &apos;s what your people do ?
yeah .
you beautiful genius .
i like that . that frees me of my worries .
oh , look at that ! another mitzvah ! i &apos;m two for two today .
yeah ! mitzvah ! nice . i saved a man .
oh , my god .
you know , there was a lowly bike messenger .
was just riding along , choking on his gum .
oh , geez .
and i performed heimlich &apos;s maneuver on him , rescued him .
great .
yeah , who &apos;s the good man now ?
you &apos;re almost forced to admit it .
almost ... you &apos;re almost forced to admit it .
yeah , i know .
i &apos;m a hero , nick , now ...
just tell me that i &apos;m a good man .
i really need to hear it .
i don &apos;t even know if i &apos;m a good person .
i &apos;m not the guy to ask .
i have my moods .
but we &apos;re not talking about you .
we &apos;re talking about me right now and how i &apos;m a good person ,
so it &apos;d be really nice if you could say that .
i &apos;m ready to do a tzatziki . tzedakah .
this is not about tzedakah right now .
this is about me being a good man and you telling me that .
absolutely .
so , well , say it .
you got it .
s @-@ say that i &apos;m a good man .
i &apos;m giving away my money .
i &apos;ve been trying to listen to you this whole time !
damn it , nick ,
you are so drunk right now
and at the bar you work at , no less . yeah .
what happens with the rest of your day ?
do you even think about that ?
you don &apos;t understand drinking at all .
don &apos;t go .
heathcliff .
hi , i &apos;d like to unpay some parking tickets .
excuse me ?
well , i sent in a payment earlier for some tickets
and i decided i don &apos;t want to pay them .
well , just cancel the checks .
can &apos;t do that &apos; cause i paid cash
&apos;cause my boyfriend doesn &apos;t believe in banks .
it &apos;s early in the relationship .
still shaving above the knee if you know what i mean .
let me get this straight-- you want me to watch the mail
and let you know if i see anything from your boyfriend .
exactly .
fantastic-- should i call you or ... ?
text , text would be great .
perfect .
let me put your number into my phone .
i didn &apos;t give you my number yet .
oh , i think you did .
it &apos;s your lucky day , old friend .
i had an interesting talk with schmidt ,
and i &apos;ve decided to give away my fortune .
so , what do i owe you ?
how much money d ... ? uh ...
hey , guys , what &apos;s going on ?
hey , jess , um ...
it &apos;s tzatziki is what it &apos;s called .
it &apos;s a jewish charity .
nick was just about to pay me the money that he owes me .
wait !
come on , what are you doing ?
i &apos;m , uh , i &apos;m lubing up , sally ...
from ankles to ears ?
the door &apos;s locked-- you want me to bust in ?
son of a ...
it opened !
where are you ?
um , i just was hot , i wanted some shade .
oh , done that .
take my money ?
winston !
it was me , it was me , it was me .
i &apos;m so sorry , i went through your box--
i just couldn &apos;t help it
and i paid some of your bills , and i &apos;m so sorry i ...
hey , nick ...
you gonna leave me here ?
nick ... that &apos;s fair .
there he is , alive and well .
mazel .
i br @-@ brought you these .
how &apos;s my brave little soldier doing , huh ?
not great .
they said that i &apos;m never gonna be able to ride a bike again .
so there goes my job .
sure , sure .
do you think that i &apos;m a good person ?
i ... i don &apos;t really know you .
well , what more do you need to know ?
if not for me , you probably would have died today .
well , somebody probably would have come along .
just say that i &apos;m a good person .
well , i mean ...
why is that so hard for you to say ?
i &apos;m sorry .
i am so sorry .
you &apos;re a good person .
i am ? you really think so ?
very good .
thank you for saying that .
yeah . that really means ...
it means a lot .
i finally feel like i can breathe again .
good .
what happ ... what happened to him ?
well , he got smoked by a bus while he was having a bake sale
for cancer kids .
for , for canc-- for cancer kids ?
yeah .
but he @-@ he &apos;s , he &apos;s a great person .
bad things happen to good people all the time .
of course they do .
what am i even chasing here ?
what is the point of being a good person ?
some say moral integrity is the cornerstone to humanity .
what do you know , you idiot ?
you choked on a piece of gum today .
hey , man , don &apos;t shoot the bike messenger .
that is a terrible joke !
and none of this makes any sense !
hey , nick .
look , i know you &apos;re really angry and you have a right to be .
i have the right to be ?
i mean , why do you feel like you need to fix me ?
it &apos;s like you think you know better .
well , i m ... i might know better than you .
did you start a corporation ?
was it fat face ?
i think so .
yeah .
well , you &apos;re getting taxed like crazy .
well , that &apos;s because i thought i was filing a patent .
fat face is an invention ?
kind of-- in its intention it was suppo-- it ...
are you a lifeguard ?
no , that is a false certificate .
just a classic beach prank .
that seems dangerous .
it &apos;s funny , &apos; cause i ... i can &apos;t swim .
everyone was watching me , and i &apos;m like , &quot; i don &apos;t know &quot;
i was 13 !
i was 26 .
this is the problem with the box .
it &apos;s my private stuff .
you &apos;ve never once done jury duty or paid your taxes .
not until gay marriage is legal everywhere .
i stand by that .
and i don &apos;t want to do jury duty or pay taxes .
nick , you &apos;re in so much debt , it &apos;s crazy .
okay .
you have to deal with this stuff .
no , i don &apos;t , jess , it &apos;s in my box .
that &apos;s not true , though .
it &apos;s not a perfect system , jess ,
but it &apos;s mine , okay ? and it &apos;s private .
well , i &apos;m sorry i went through your damn box ,
but i was just trying to help you , nick .
so maybe i &apos;ll try to help you .
what if i went into your box ?
not that .
stop it !
i like that box ,
but i &apos;m mad at you ... !
i &apos;m back to &quot; you disrespected me . &quot;
i was just trying to help .
then how about this . two can help . okay ?
and if two are going to help , then i &apos;ll be one of them
&apos;cause two can tango on this dance , okay ?
so , you want to waltz ?
well , you picked the wrong dance partner .
two can play .
what ? it &apos;s not a ...
who needs changing , huh , who needs fixing ?
really ...
i &apos;m gonna go through your personal drawers
and see what needs changing .
what are you , a zoo elephant ?
those are my night peanuts .
there shouldn &apos;t be day peanuts and night peanuts !
they &apos;re just peanuts !
i &apos;m sorry , why is that weird ?
you just have a bunch of boxes ? i would change that .
oh , you have a bunch of metal toothpicks .
they &apos;re bobby pins .
what &apos;s a bobby pin ?
it keeps your hair back .
you need bobby &apos;s pins to put your hair up ?
it &apos;s bobby pins , not bobby &apos;s pins .
what is this ? !
yarn .
what are you knitting , a mansion ? !
oh , look at this . what do we have here ?
a bunch of beat @-@ up old sacks .
my vintage purses .
well , you know what ?
they could be sexier .
you want my purses to be sexier ?
would it kill you to get something sleek ,
covered in gems for once ?
you want my purses to be covered in gemstones ?
all guys do ! that &apos;s what we think is sexy !
we want to be playing a saxophone in an alley
and have you walk by
in a miniskirt with a purse with gems .
but you girls don &apos;t listen !
what ? !
changing !
no ! nick , no !
this all is changing . this all ...
no ,
no , stop ! that &apos;s disrespectful !
gone !
nick , stop it !
no ! this is the grossest thing i &apos;ve ever seen in my life !
i got that for a nickel .
that &apos;s disgusting .
you &apos;re just trying to get a rise out of me .
oh , my god !
i &apos;ve gotten a lot of compliments on that one .
gone !
nick !
what ?
stop it ! look , i like you the way you are .
i &apos;m just asking you to grow a little .
are we ever gonna get to a point where you stop working on me ?
instead of changing me ,
maybe once , jess , see it my way .
well , your way &apos;s crazy and illegal .
this is me , take it or leave it .
i &apos;m not changing for anyone .
hey , where are you going ?
if you have something to say , just say it .
don &apos;t write me a note or ...
that &apos;s the money i spent .
do what you want with it .
thank you .
couple of best friend horses . that &apos;s neat .
what else can you get on ... ?
it doesn &apos;t make any sense .
can you not see i &apos;m in the middle of a bar mitzvah class here ?
yeah , well , they should hear this .
a man helping cancer kids got creamed by a bus today .
everything happens for a reason .
but what if it doesn &apos;t happen for a reason ?
maybe ... maybe there aren &apos;t any good guys and bad guys .
maybe there are just winners and losers .
i was beating myself up , but maybe i should ...
maybe i should have been celebrating .
have you ever dated two women at once ?
what are you talking about ?
i went to camp-- they used to call me the octopus .
clearly , you have not , sir .
that &apos;s enough .
you get out of here right now !
out .
don &apos;t you &quot; out &quot; me .
get out , get ...
getting a little handsy there , rabbi .
get out !
you know what i realize ?
nothing matters , and that &apos;s great . you know why ?
because if nothing matters ,
we can do whatever we want , rabbi .
avram ! julio !
get away from me , man .
kick his ass !
all right , okay .
yolo ! yolo !
nick &apos;s right .
i have too many purses .
you &apos;re addicted to purses .
i &apos;m addicted to development fluid-- i get it .
this one &apos;s for meat , and this one &apos;s for shells .
you know what ?
keep them . they &apos;re yours .
okay , thanks .
also , heads up-- the ass of your pants is missing .
it &apos;s for the kitty cats .
my phone &apos;s ringing .
sure .
hello ?
i &apos;m like a pretty lady .
what &apos;s happening ?
i &apos;m sorry to bother you , miss day .
but this man was trying to open an account
with a check in your name and a paper bag full of money .
would you please stop hovering ? i &apos;m being cooperative .
it &apos;s fine . he &apos;s okay .
thank you , though .
opening a bank account , huh ?
yeah , i , uh ...
i realized something .
what ?
i &apos;d do anything for you , jess .
thank you .
all right , mr. miller ,
your checking account is good to go .
oh , there &apos;s just an eight dollar processing fee .
eight dollars ?
that &apos;s a very specific amount .
that &apos;s fine-- it &apos;s your world , your rules , so ...
excellent .
you go to the castle , you got to pay the king .
what is processing ? what does that mean ?
it &apos;s just a word you use to make more money off of us .
that makes me mad !
me , too , yeah .
hey , how about this ? what &apos;s a bank ?
yeah . it &apos;s just a paper bag ...
that &apos;s right . yes !
... with walls .
you &apos;re making some really ,
really , really good points , ma &apos;am .
you are the puppeteers that puppet the world .
no more banks !
or some banks-- i don &apos;t care !
but i want my money on a boat !
i understood at least 30 %
of the financial crisis ,
and guess what i got from that ?
you ... suck !
yeah .
you suck so hard .
and now , i &apos;m gonna process this man &apos;s face ,
&apos;cause i think he &apos;s great .
and i &apos;m crazy about him .
fine , i &apos;ll waive the fee .
yeah !
we won eight dollars !
just wait till you have children .
you &apos;ll never touch each other again .
banks suck ! banks suck ! banks suck !
what the hell happened to you ?
got beat up by some rabbis .
well , winston , we &apos;re all alone .
nothing matters .
but you know what ? look schmidt , stop , all right ?
you &apos;re a good man .
you did a bad thing-- doesn &apos;t make you bad .
we just have to try to be better , you know ?
been waiting all day for somebody to tell me that .
i ... i really appreciate it . thank you .
i want you to have something .
winston , literally , a gift is the last thing i des ...
this is ...
there you go .
this is a candelabra .
yeah .
i bought it with the money that nick owed me .
this is what you spent it on ?
and now it &apos;s yours .
may it illuminate your path
and lead you ... out of the darkness .
that &apos;s what it says on the bottom .
may it illuminate your path , lead you out of darkness .
uh , uh , thank you for this-- really .
look at it every single day and tell yourself ,
&quot; i &apos;m a good person , &quot; &apos; cause you are .
you know what i might do , though ?
and it might seem like the opposite , but ,
what i &apos;m actually thinking is ,
maybe i &apos;ll just put it away somewhere , like in--
i don &apos;t know-- in the back of my closet
so to keep it away from thieves .
oh , yeah , yeah . yeah .
can you be honest with me real quick ?
how many times did you rub this thing
and think a genie was gonna come out ?
i ain &apos;t gonna lie to you man .
i rubbed it , like , three times .
i thought so .
you know , i &apos;m not ...
if a genie did come out , what would you wish for ?
more candelabras .
yeah , i bet .
