第一季 第五集
yes . i told you i &apos;d come through .
okay , benjamin just invited us to a very cool party .
i just got off three back @-@ to @-@ back shifts at the bar .
i just want to sit here all weekend in silence playing this game ,
then i want to go in my room and do weird stuff on my computer .
are you even wearing underwear ?
what is between you and that chair ?
just a little bit of sunshine .
all right , take off that kimono , please .
it &apos;s my leisure wear , winston .
look , i worked 80 hours this week .
i just want to come home , put on my &apos; mono
and just hang loose , man .
okay ? if you had a job , you &apos;d understand .
r @-@ really ? wow .
it just got real in here .
okay , you &apos;re not gonna take the kimono off ? fine .
then i &apos;m not wearing any pants .
everybody want to just walk around
this house wearing all kinds of stupid stuff ,
then guess what i &apos;m gonna do , schmidt .
i &apos;m wearing a napkin on my face .
bam ! how you like that ?
that doesn &apos;t even make any sense , winston .
it makes perfect sense .
totally different than me wearing my kimono .
you are laughing in the face of
thousands of years of samurai culture ,
and it &apos;s an affront , winston , it &apos;s an affront .
look at me now , huh ? this is the vibe
we have in the house now because of you .
you want to walk around here looking silly .
this is handcrafted ! in china .
schmidt , i think you should take the kimono off .
um , cece , can you not do your usual thing ?
these are really good guys .
best behavior .

just doing this .
you know , friday night .
i &apos;m gonna use the ladies &apos; .
what &apos;s up , cecelia ?
where &apos;s the tequila ?
guys .
okay .
i would normally never bring her here ,
but cece &apos;s really vulnerable right now ,
and when she &apos;s drunk , she has no boundaries .
so she &apos;s really grabby , really physical ,
she &apos;s really loose with her body .
so i just want to apologize in advance for anything
that she might do .
that &apos;s good to know .
yeah , thanks for telling us .
thank you , guys .
you &apos;re the best .
this is the opposite of being alone !
this is the opposite of what i wanted this weekend .
wow , how &apos;d this happen ?
okay , i &apos;m not a part of this , schmidt .
i &apos;m not a part of this .
hi , cece .
i &apos;m gonna make you a bed on the couch , okay ?

we &apos;re just friends .
you can &apos;t be friends with these guys .
you don &apos;t think that every single one of them
has thought about sleeping with you ?
no , you just think everyone wants
to sleep with everyone all the time .
they do . that &apos;s why i think that .
don &apos;t you hear how he says your name ?
&quot; jess . &quot;
he &apos;s from chicago .
that &apos;s how people from chicago say &quot; jess . &quot;
like &quot; bears &quot; and &quot; milk &quot;
and &quot; let &apos;s go visit the sears tower . &quot;
hey , jess .
i &apos;m going to the drugstore . need anything ?

walter matthau in grumpy old men .
and i could be girl jack lemmon .
he &apos;s a total matthau !
i &apos;m telling you , he gets you .
and did you see his feet ?
a guy &apos;s feet point at what they want .
his feet were pointing right at you .
why wouldn &apos;t his feet point at me ?

oh , not long .
i know she can be tough to deal with .
sometimes she just calls me up
and she &apos;s like , &quot; bitch , i love you . &quot;
and then she just hangs up .
no other information .
weird .
but i don &apos;t know , i kind of like it when she calls me &quot; bitch . &quot;
it makes me feel like janis joplin .
fine , but does she have to stay with us ?

i &apos;ve been driving around for the last hour looking for you .
everything is okay , and we were hoping to get
everything out ...

the table which is not a table , it doesn &apos;t exist .
don &apos;t worry about the table .
we were in the middle of traffic
and you just got out and ran away .
i was hot .
you were so hot that you had to jump out of my car and run ?
why are you standing like that ?
this is how i stand .
i &apos;ve never seen you stand like that .
i was really worried
something had happened to you , ok ?
and you can &apos;t just walk around this neighborhood
with bags full of toilet paper , that you don &apos;t even use .

that &apos;s okay . i &apos;m used to it .
i guess i &apos;ll just always be the fat kid with the big dreams .
it &apos;s not you .
i love cece , but she &apos;s not ready for you .
you &apos;re a good guy ,
you know , if you ignore everything that you do on purpose ,
and concentrate on all of the things that you do by accident .
thank you .
she &apos;d eat you up .
you really think she &apos;d eat me up ?
yeah .
like buffet style ?
you know , all you can eat ?
&apos;cause i got that prime rib , yo .

except for the last ...
all right , let &apos;s go . let &apos;s go , schmidt , okay ?
okay .
hey , cece . um ...
look , i get it . this isn &apos;t going to happen .
but the couch is super uncomfortable ,
my sunburn &apos;s starting to blister ,
and i just want to sleep in my own bed .
okay .
i &apos;m sorry for everything .
i can be a jerk sometimes .
i hate sleeping alone .
me , too .
sweet .
shall weee ...
better when you don &apos;t talk .
yeah .
if you tell anyone we held hands ,
i have two people in my phone that will kill you .
literally .
i &apos;m sorry i acted so weird today . weird !
it &apos;s okay .
yo .
i did it , man .
i &apos;m holding her hand right now . she &apos;s in my bed
and she &apos;s asleep .
wait , so you &apos;re in ... you &apos;re in the room right now ?
what is wrong with you ? hang up the phone .
i did it . i closed .
we could have this conversation at any time .
shh . please , shh .
okay , we &apos;re good .
and just so we &apos;re clear , when i say &quot; closing , &quot;
this is not what i &apos;m talking about .
you need to define your terms .
because what i &apos;m doing right now feels an awful lot like closing .
