trick @-@ or @-@ treat !
* on this filthy night of evil *
* little gaudy beggars stroll *
* as they lure ghouls , ghosts and goblins *
* hungry for their innocent souls *
* there is a hellish breeze a @-@ groanin &apos; *
* as the children they pursue *
* you can hear their bellies moanin &apos; *
* they might even gnaw on you *
* but ruler of this sordid host *
* more ghastly than them all *
* lurks a ravenous beastly monster *
* more than 25 feet tall *
* he &apos;s dirty and he &apos;s hairy *
* and his mouth tastes just like crap *
* like you , he &apos;s trick @-@ or @-@ treating for *
* some candies to unwrap *
* the lord abhors your foul disguise *
* you thought to cloak your skin *
* but now you &apos;ve lured this fiend from hell *
* who craves your soul within *
* he &apos;s hungry for your vitals *
* he likes you moist and ripe *
* and should he find you spiced with sin *
* then you &apos;re his favorite type *
* he &apos;ll chew your juicy insides *
* masticate you till you &apos;re pulp *
* every little soul he &apos;ll swallow *
* with a stinky @-@ ass gulp . *

&apos;twas i who texted you !
using milhouse &apos;s phone .

now let me put this in terms any young boy would understand :
you and i have danced a grand pas de deux
worthy of nijinsky .
but this is the final plie !
yawn . you couldn &apos;t kill me with that thing
if i drew an &quot; x &quot; on my forehead .
* bob and his spear gun *
* sittin &apos; in a tree *
* s @-@ u @-@ c @-@ k @-@ i @-@ n ... *
nice try , bob ,
but i &apos;m sure you made some stupid ...
mistake .
not this time .
tell my father ...
he &apos;s fat .
the deed is done .
24 years of trying
to kill a ten @-@ year @-@ old child
have finally paid off .
* i did it , i did it , i did it *

* la , la , la , la , la , la , la , la , la , lots *
* of blood *
* i did what could not be done *
* to bugs bunny by elmer fudd .
fortunately it &apos;s after school hours .
good @-@ bye !
a votre sante !
you wouldn &apos;t know ,
but that means &quot; to your health , &quot;
of which you have none !
bart &apos;s father !
bart &apos;s dog !
where &apos;s bart ?
i don &apos;t know who you &apos;re talking about .
this bart !
well , i suppose that does look damning ,
but have you seen this ?
he &apos;s cool .
let &apos;s move on to the next suspect .
侯默 · 辛普森
well , i &apos;d better check it out .
not to complain , but your stomach acids
are smoothing the dimples off my balls .
it &apos;s time i moved to my post @-@ bartum phase .
i &apos;ve accepted an associate professorship
at springfield university .
如果你能读懂这些字 就能来上大学
&quot; i should have been a pair of ragged claws ,
&quot; scuttling across the floors of silent seas . &quot;
what do eliot &apos;s ragged claws represent ?
this web site says the claws aren &apos;t a metaphor ,
but , like , an insight to a state of mind .
crushed it !
what web site ?
forward the link .
text me .
tweet the link .
where is it ?
i didn &apos;t think the author of cats
could be insulted further .
class dismissed .
rubbish !
drivel !
what is this game of thrones
they &apos;re referencing ?
i was a fool to think i &apos;d find solace
amongst these moronic , snapchatting , gap @-@ yearing ...
hello , bart.
it seems the only thing that made me happy
in my accursed life was killing you .
well , if white zinfandel can make a comeback ,
so can you .
ooh , those bastards know how to party !
i feel like a bad new yorker cartoon .
and now , bart ,
let &apos;s bring the old &quot; spark &quot;
back to our special relationship .
you couldn &apos;t kill me
if i came in with pneumonia and a knife in my back .
i didn &apos;t care for the &quot; thwock &quot; the sledgehammer made .
no worries , i &apos;ll just kill him again .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m the un @-@ killable kid .
still not dead .
psych !
we &apos;re both going to be sore tomorrow .
how much power is this thing using ?
what is it , boy ?
what have you found ?
i knew it was bob !
even when they tried and executed jailbird ,
i knew it was bob !
reanimate ?
this animation looks good enough to me .
homer , pull the lever !
i &apos;ve been pulling levers all day .
now !
wow , for once , i was sober at bart &apos;s birth .
yes , that &apos;s right , officer .
there are intruders in my basement .
have i the right to shoot ?
oh , yeah .
and you can wear blue jeans to a broadway show .
everything &apos;s different now .
wait , dad !
that &apos;s for trying to frame krusty .
what about all the times he tried to kill me ?
as the one who suffered the most , mom ,
may i have custody of bob &apos;s body ?
normally i &apos;d say no ,
but you have been showing responsibility
with the dog lately .
so , fine .
by sea @-@ girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown ,
&quot; till human voices wake us
&quot; and we drown . &quot;
any questions ?
yes , what are you supposed to be again ?
a full professor !
but the tenure committee is excruciatingly slow .
look at that foolish old man !
every day he drops a perfectly good donut into the ocean .
let us mock him for his foolish beliefs !
yes ! yes !
let us show disrespect
with poorly @-@ dubbed laughter .
children , go with your grandfather .
can &apos;t we go with dead grandfather ?
he cannot leave .
he is the spirit of my tea kettle .
lucky me .
grampa , everyone in town thinks you are foolish .
who is more foolish--
the fool or the fool
who thinks the fool a fool ?
what the hell does that mean , grampa @-@ san ?
for centuries , our family has made a daily offering
of a special donut to a slumbering
underwater sea creature ,
so that he does not rise and destroy us all .
he is foolish !
so foolish !
doesn &apos;t mean you are not special .
now i have all eternity to talk to you .
now we will no longer have anyone
uselessly floating donuts in the ocean .
they have made our fish fat and ugly .
pathetic .
all right , calm down , children .
probably just excitement over the cherry blossoms .
of course , the cherry blossoms !
they &apos;re so beautiful , and yet ...
i still refuse to admit the old man was right .
legitimate difference of opinion .
professor , how do we stop him ?
fear not !
without the buoyancy of water ,
it is physically impossible for any creature that large
not to collapse under its own weight .
it &apos;s a simple matter of--
gloy !
d &apos;oh !
jo !
scared by the monster ?
what monster ?
yellow ribbon &apos; round ...
why do you have to stomp on our buildings ?
this land is 98 % rural .
so much farmland you can walk on without hurting your feet .
right , right .
the city &apos;s the only place you can get
tuna rolls at 5 : 00 in the morning .
because you do have fishy breath .
i &apos;m just telling you .
ah , thank you .
so , the key to this movie is it &apos;s so cheap ! it &apos;s funny .
then just think how popular it would be
if we spent a fortune remaking it .
we &apos;ll make millions !
after spending hundreds of millions !
we &apos;re here live at the premiere of &apos; zilla !
and this time , the stars have come out at night !
lurleen lumpkin , drederick tatum ...
and my ex @-@ husband , the grumple .
as a tie @-@ in to this movie ,
krustyburgers will be made from only reptile meat .
and don &apos;t worry , peta ,
we only buy the sick ones !
buzz cola !
干渴怪兽
we can &apos;t stop it ! we can &apos;t !
all we can do is avoid him easily !
he &apos;s 2,000 miles away
moving at two miles a day .
what do i do ?
what do i do ? !
it &apos;s a total bomb .
we only sold one ticket .
oh , i didn &apos;t buy my ticket for this .
i just wanted to get a good seat for the next star wars .
which will stink to high heaven .
there &apos;s only one thing we can do .
dump everything at sea
and say we lost it for insurance purposes .
aw , yeah , that &apos;s moviemaking , steve .
that &apos;s why we all report to you .
toss them overboard , then kill the navigator .
i see a yellow monarch ,
a woodland skipper .
i see ...
you know , we have been hiking for hours
and you two haven &apos;t spotted a single butterfly .
i thought we were hunting owls .
well , you haven &apos;t done that , either !
don &apos;t worry , the hole isn &apos;t very deep .
oh , wait , i &apos;m on a ledge .
oh , god , everything is moist and moving !
bart ? !
what ? i &apos;m going home .
to my toy chest , to get my barrel of monkeys ,
to lower them down .
at least i &apos;m pitching .
we got to save him !
fine , but you &apos;ll follow me with the camera , right ?
&apos;cause the important thing these days
is everything must be on film .
okay , guys .
my cell phone is somewhere in that pulsing ooze .
now each grab one ankle while i dive in !
we have to be careful , milhouse .
there &apos;s no telling what that stu ...
bart , what are you doing ? !
madam , how do you do ?
you don &apos;t know what that stuff is doing to you !
oh , it &apos;s just the same junk dad brings us home from work .
to us simpsons , this green goop is mother &apos;s ...
where are my owls ?
oh , man , am i looking at a nosebleed !
somehow , the radioactive explosion
gave us the power to move things with our intellect .
flowers for the lady ?
bart , what powers did your brain give you ?
look , you &apos;re talking to the guy that got demoted
from the tadpoles reading group , okay ?
do not make me pity fly .
dignity restored .
you know , we can &apos;t tell anyone about this .
there are going to be lab tests and scientists ...
do we get to wear those paper gowns ?
it &apos;s a dress that boys can wear .
wedgie !
this is not a proportional punishment !
hmm , somebody misspelled &quot; wiener . &quot;
lisa simpson !
the musicians union does not allow this !
you know this is an ascap household .
god gave you this power for good ,
not jazz , and ...
the &apos; house always wins !
i even got my parents back together !
even now i don &apos;t feel close to you .
ah , finally i can diaper all my children .
yo , hands up .
hmm , milhouse has gone mad with power .
frankly , i thought it wouldn &apos;t take this long .
everything &apos;s coming up milhouse !
nicely done , lis .
i didn &apos;t do it .
then i want to know who did !
but not that badly .
excuse me , uh ,
ou est le eiffel tower ?
i appreciate that you are trying to learn our language .
once again we just have a cameo .
don &apos;t complain or they &apos;ll put us in 4x3 .
aah , they &apos;re doing it ! no !
just &apos; cause it looks like season four
doesn &apos;t make it season four !
