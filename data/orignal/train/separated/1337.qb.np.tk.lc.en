we -- we can work this out .
um , i &apos;ve got a proposal
that &apos;s gonna work for both of us .
hey . wait . what are you doing ?
okay , why won &apos;t you just let me call for help ?
because you will call 911,
and they will send a fire engine and a surgical team
for a sprained ankle .
just -- just help me up . - okay . come on .
okay . okay .
thank you .
okay , that &apos;s better .
give me your keys
and let me drive you to the hospital .

&quot; fine &quot; is an adverb . it means &quot; pleasing or very well . &quot;
so , you &apos;re very well ?
yes . ow !

i just want to examine it .
do not touch my ankle .
you let me look at it or i speed @-@ dial 911 .
i hate you .
no , you don &apos;t hate me . you just hate feeling vulnerable .
okay . does this hurt ?
yes ! ow .
okay . what about this ?
please stop touching it !
i suspect you have a partial tear
in your anterior talofibular ligament .
otherwise known as a sprained ankle .
you have to go see a doctor .
i just did . bill my insurance .

i don &apos;t know . like , 60,000 . why ?
just curious . okay , see you .
meet you inside .
see you .
oh , what did you do ?
i sprained my ankle .
you know the only way to get her to a hospital
is to knock her out , right ?
yeah , don &apos;t tempt me .
just -- can you please just help me inside ?
all right .
no , don &apos;t you dare .
until you agree to let me x @-@ ray it .

senior criminalist chang
went to the store and bought you a new shoe .
size 9 , right ?
no . no way .
yes . yes way .
susie , can you please hold down detective rizzoli
so we can put the protective boot on her ?
o @-@ okay .
give me that . i &apos;ll do it myself .
no , it hurts . it hurts . it hurts .
all right . distract yourself .
okay . um ...
do you think that the army reads
all the e @-@ mails that i send casey ?
well , of course .
the defense aadvanced research projects agency
has algorithms that analyze everything .
well , that &apos;s just wrong .
why ? what kind of e @-@ mails are you writing ?
mushy stuff .
well , i think the government
is looking for traitors and terrorists ,
not to make fun of you and your mushy e @-@ mails to your boyfriend .
he &apos;s not my boyfriend .
he &apos;s my ...
... long @-@ distance lover .
oh . 6,500 miles .
that &apos;s -- that &apos;s a lot of distance .
yes , maura , and ?
well , i just find it interesting
that your relationship with casey
heated up the second he got on a plane to afghanistan .
w @-@ well ?
okay .
yes . fine . i mean , i @-@ i miss him .
now .
well , he just -- he got all domestic ,
and -- and it just made me claustrophobic .
don &apos;t you wish you could press a button
and have men appear when you wanted them ?
yes .
well , maybe you can amuse yourself with rafael .
if you don &apos;t , maybe i will .
martinez ? no .
and he wasn &apos;t looking at either one of us .
he was ... looking at my car .
do you think he &apos;s gonna take my car for the drug unit ?
well , he can &apos;t just take your car , jane .
he can . he &apos;s a lieutenant .
and i heard the drug unit was short on cars .
well , hold on .
don &apos;t react to something that hasn &apos;t happened .
you &apos;re right . okay . all right .
okay , how are you gonna get upstairs ?
well , does senior criminalist chang have crutches ?
i &apos;m telling you , it &apos;s probably torn .
can you please just give me some crutches ? !
oh , ohh , god .
no , i &apos;m gonna wait here . i was --
ohh ! mommy , mommy , mommy , mommy , mommy !
you broke more bones than your brothers combined .
how do you do this to yourself ?
it &apos;s not broken .
bunny pancakes ? thanks , angela .
uh @-@ oh . what did you do ?
what ? i thought it looked cool .
maura said a big boot is the new black .
well , i think she tore a ligament .
stop saying that .
how did you do it ?
wrestling bulls .
no , i was chasing a bad guy .
i tripped while jogging .
i &apos;ll tell anybody who asks you were sword fighting .
hey , vinnie .
hola , guapo .
buenos dias , preciosa .
buenos dias , lieutenant .
i &apos;ll have my usual .
why is he so nice to my mother ?
because he &apos;s not interested in sleeping with her .
what ? maura .
no , that &apos;s it .
that is why he ignores you --
because he &apos;s attracted to you .
what ? no .
mm . yes .
no , no , no , no . mm @-@ hmm .
no .
what did you do ? kick somebody .
yeah .
is it serious ?
no .
yes .
yes , it could be a torn ligament ,
which is more serious than a broken bone .
oh , then i hate to do this to you today ,
but i need your keys .
my keys ? because you &apos;re taking my car ?
why would you take her car ?
look at her . she needs it .
come on , rafe .
you got to share , vinnie .
chief of detectives assigned some of your cars to me .
i &apos;m sorry .
hey , honey . here . take mine .
thanks , ma , but detectives aren &apos;t allowed
to use personal cars for work .
we have a fatal hit @-@ and @-@ run .
my least favorite call .
it &apos;s usually some jackass running a light .
come on , jane . me and dr . isles can do a fireman &apos;s carry .
we can even stop by boston joe &apos;s .
will that make you feel better ?
yes .
i &apos;ll need a quadruple latte with an ibuprofen fo
to make this day go better .
oh , yeah , maura .
he took my car because he likes me .
he really , really likes me .
hey . you should get going .
that hit @-@ and @-@ run might be a homicide .
hold on . he &apos;ll still be dead when we get there .
wet cap for barry .
that &apos;s me .
careful .
it &apos;s hot .
got it . thanks .
speaking of hot . hmm .
too hot .
i think that &apos;s the little barista
that called your partner a bitch .
well , she is the one , all right .
oh , where is jane ?
she &apos;s waiting in the car . i &apos;m worried about her ankle .
i &apos;m also worried about detective frost
flirting with the barista that was rude to his partner .
i &apos;m just looking .
large house for vince .
oh , i got it .
extra @-@ hot flat latte , no foam , for ... maura .
free coffee on me .
i &apos;d love to see you in here again .
see you at the scene .
bye .
oh , boy , are you in trouble now .
thank you .
where &apos;s jane ?
i took her back to headquarters . she couldn &apos;t walk .
maybe she should go to a hospital .
wait . how did she get upstairs ?
frankie and two uniforms carried her .
i thought they &apos;d have to handcuff her .
jane &apos;s calling me from her desk phone . what should we do ?
answer it before she tries to come down here .
hey , jane .
okay , put me on the tablet so i can see the crime scene .
yeah , tell her only if her foot is elevated .
you hear that ?
yeah , it &apos;s up . it &apos;s up . show me .
who &apos;s that ?
david sutton . 35 .
he taught science and driver &apos;s ed at the high school .
that &apos;s a cruel irony .
driver &apos;s ed teacher dies in a hit @-@ and @-@ run .
groundskeeper found him in the bushes
just as school was starting .
what do you think ? accident or homicide ?
not sure . frost , follow me .
i think the point of impact was right about here .
take a photo .
okay , this is interesting .
what ? what is it ?
it &apos;s a headlight @-@ bulb fragment .
filament &apos;s still there .
so , the driver &apos;s headlights were off .
how can you tell ?
tungsten filament is brittle when it &apos;s cold ,
but it &apos;ll stretch
if the headlights are on at the time of the collision .
if they &apos;re off , it &apos;ll break . that one &apos;s busted .
come on .
intermittent skid marks .
i &apos;m seeing acceleration marks , too .
i never did accident reconstruction .
so , someone slammed on the brakes .
you mean , before they hit him ?
yeah .
then , with their headlights off ,
they gunned it and ran into the victim .
so , does that mean --
yeah . means this probably wasn &apos;t an accident .
you got it ?
yeah .
how long has he been dead ?
the body is just in the first stage of rigor .
8 to 10 hours .
so , this happened last night ?
uh @-@ huh . he was carrying a key .
take it to the crime lab .
that &apos;s a strange key .
looks like a modern version of a skeleton key .
maybe it &apos;s to his office .
frost , let &apos;s go interview the principal .
we can bag him now .
okay .
i &apos;m a reporter with wzjt .
care to comment about your dead teacher , mr. sutton ?
excuse me .
the reporter &apos;s just doing his job ,
but i told him to leave you alone .
thank you .
did you know mr. sutton ?
we all had him for driver &apos;s ed .
i also had him for a.p. chem .
i had him for a.p. bio .
and i was the idiot that had him for both .
he was so fun .
we would always try cool experiments .
do you have any advice ?
any advice ?
on how we deal with this ?
i think your grief counselors can help with that ,
and lean on each other .
okay . thank you .
you know what this key is for ?
we found it in his pocket .
no . never seen it before .
all the keys here look like this .
were there any students
who might have had a problem with mr. sutton ?
what , you th-- you think this wasn &apos;t an accident ?
any kid with a grudge ? somebody he might have flunked ?
well , sure . kids and parents
complain all the time about all my teachers .
mr. sutton was strict . his curriculum was hard .
you &apos;ll find a number of complaints in his files .
we &apos;ll need that ,
his classroom files , and his computer .
probably at his house .
i just spoke with his wife , poor thing .
they just had their third baby .
we &apos;ll head over and talk to her . thank you .
we are very sorry for your loss .
i told him not to jog at night .
why didn &apos;t he listen ?
how often did he go running ?
a lot .
mrs. sutton , where were you last night ?
asleep . why ?
why didn &apos;t you call the police
when your husband failed to come back from his jog ?
the baby keeps him up . he sleeps in the den .
do you think this was deliberate ?
is that why you &apos;re asking me that ?
i have three kids under the age of 4 .
i &apos;m not gonna kill their father .
did he have trouble with any of his students or their parents ?
no . he was very dedicated .
he was teacher of the year more than once .
he even taught driver &apos;s ed for free
because the school district didn &apos;t have the funding .
is this key to your house ?
no . i don &apos;t know what that &apos;s for .
is that your husband &apos;s computer ?
yes .
mommy &apos;s coming .
my kids are crying .
we &apos;ll need to take his computer .
all right . take whatever you need .
it doesn &apos;t look like he did much jogging .
well , he didn &apos;t .
his gluteal aponeurosis and maxi @-@ muscle
have very poor definition .
oh , let &apos;s not talk about his butt .
there &apos;s a gash in his sartorius .
you mean his thigh ?
no , i mean his sartorius .
it &apos;s a muscle in the thigh .
can you see all this bruising and this gash ?
it &apos;s probably from the front of the grille that hit him .
maura , we got to find this hit @-@ and @-@ run car .
is there anything in the wound ?
hmm . let me take a look .
hmm . i see particulates . blue and gray .
i &apos;ll get them analyzed .
i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m gonna miss more --
walking or driving my own car .
well , you shouldn &apos;t be doing either .
you should be home , icing your foot .
i just never realized how important my car was to me , you know ?
i hope this isn &apos;t personal .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
well , i @-@ it could be a form of grown @-@ up teasing .
you know , rafael likes you ,
but he &apos;s frustrated because you &apos;re not interested .
what ? ! don &apos;t be ridiculous .
well , he took frost &apos;s car , too .
i don &apos;t think he &apos;s attracted to him .
i know detectives who have quit when they took their cars .
and -- and -- and i get it , you know ?
we spend our entire lives with dead people
and that &apos;s how they thank us ?
no disrespect .
he says , &quot; none taken . &quot;
what ? what &apos;s that ?
he says , &quot; you &apos;re a great detective .
find out who did this to me . &quot;
yeah , don corleone has nothing on you .
just when i thought i was out ,
you pull me back in !
hi ! mm . i got it . i got it .
if it were me , i &apos;d come down with the blue flu
till i got my car back .
no , you wouldn &apos;t .
especially if you were looking for someone
who mowed down a teacher .
i mean , it &apos;s almost like killing a cop .
so , all you &apos;ve got is part of a light bulb and skid marks .
yeah .
you &apos;re gonna need encyclopedia brown for this one .
that &apos;s funny !
is it really awful there ?
yeah . it &apos;s dusty and hot , but i &apos;m okay .
they call bagram airfield
&quot; camp cupcake &quot; for a reason .
good desserts ?
job &apos;s okay . look at this . my own man can .
oh , a man can .
yeah . gosh . it &apos;s positively palatial .
okay , so , come on . what -- what can i send you ?
cookies ? you want movies , tv show ?
how about you just send me you ?
well , i don &apos;t like long plane rides , so ...
maybe we can meet in the middle .
what &apos;s in between boston and afghanistan ?
the atlantic ocean .
yeah , that .
oh , i wish i could touch you .
um , speaking of privacy , um , i &apos;m in the break room ,
and someone just came in to get some coffee , so --
frost or korsak ?
it &apos;s martinez .
i &apos;m gonna say goodbye .
talk to you soon , baby .
okay .
so , that &apos;s the famous casey , huh ?
yeah .
i hear he &apos;s in afghanistan .
yeah , he &apos;s , uh , working with soldiers who have ptsd .
you miss him ?
yeah . i do .
look , i &apos;m sorry about taking your car .
you know it isn &apos;t personal , right ?
okay .
put it back .
oh , my god . it &apos;s like having four mothers .
okay . here &apos;s something .
been going through all of mr. sutton &apos;s e @-@ mail .
look at this .
who &apos;s that ?
one of his a.p. chem students . samantha cole .
&quot; give me an &apos; a &apos; -- and i &apos;ll give you some of this &quot; ?
what ? how old is she ?
just turned sweet 16 .
well , it looks like sweet , little samantha cole
wanted to get her grade changed .
she &apos;s offering a trade .
you think he said no so she ran him over ?
maybe . let &apos;s find her and ask .
i &apos;ll call the attendance office .
and we need to know every car that samantha cole had access to .
speaking of cars , i &apos;ll probably need one
if i &apos;m gonna talk to her .
hello , this is detective frost , boston police .
i need to know the whereabouts of a student --
samantha cole .
okay .
thank you .
what is it ?
i just found samantha .
maybe maura should drive you there .
why maura ?
because of where you &apos;re going .
she &apos;s been in a coma for 10 days .
well , at least we know she didn &apos;t run over mr. sutton .
what happened ?
she overdosed .
on what ?
her mother &apos;s codeine prescription .
how bad is it ?
bad .
this may be the way she spends the rest of her life .
you know , if i thought
my kid did this to herself because of some teacher ,
i might run him over .
by the time i got home from work ,
she had already been in cardiac arrest
for about 15 minutes .
do you know why she attempted suicide ?
we put too much pressure on her .
this was our fault .
suicide in teenagers is -- it &apos;s much more complicated .
no . he &apos;s right . we did .
i couldn &apos;t stop riding her .
one &quot; d , &quot; and harvard was , &quot; off the table , sam . &quot;
and why ? why did i do that ?
what did she tell you about mr. sutton ?
she loved that teacher .
she took every science class he taught .
you &apos;ve seen it ?
yeah . we found it on her phone .
we were looking through her things .
just trying to understand why she did this .
we heard about his death this morning .
i &apos;m just so glad that we made ourselves apologize to that man .
you apologized ?
for sam .
i just --
i just wish that we could tell her
that it doesn &apos;t matter .
okay , thank you .
okay , the charge nurse on samantha &apos;s floor said
that her parents were with her all night .
and the headlight debris we found
is molded , polycarbonate plastic .
like every other late @-@ model headlight .
that &apos;s not gonna help us find the car . what else ?
mm , the blue particulates in the victim &apos;s leg
are cheap automotive paint ,
and there was also navy @-@ blue paint
used exclusively on chevy impalas .
oh , excellent . okay , so frost can start a dmv search .
yeah , and tell him he &apos;s looking
for a car that &apos;s been in an accident .
wait , you mean another accident ?
yeah , the blue particulates are paint ,
so the gray stuff will be bondo .
it is . you &apos;re good .
tell my chief of detectives that ,
and maybe he &apos;ll give me my car back .
i think those guys are rating the girls in here .
here . come on . let &apos;s give them a cheap thrill .
can i borrow your pen ?
be nice .
all right .
ready ?
they like it .
they do . look at them .
what would you give me ?
hey , martinez .
oh , i would give you an 8.75 .
come on . give him a 10 . it &apos;s late .
i came by to tell you you can use this car for police business .
why do you have my mother &apos;s keys .
and , no , i can &apos;t , because regulations won &apos;t allow it .
section 14 of the massachusetts state law
allows the use of an impounded car , so , yes .
you impounded my mother &apos;s car ?
she told me to .
besides , we &apos;re both worried about you .
oh . well , thank you .
sure .
i &apos;d tike to buy you a drink ,
but i think you should take your ankle home
and get some rest .
uh , i was just leaving .
rain check okay ?
okay .
doctor .
that , my friend , is chemistry .
that can never happen again .
where &apos;s jane ?
you think she got smart and decided to stay in bed ?
are you kidding me ?
if i know hop @-@ a @-@ long , she &apos;ll be taking the stairs .
yep , that &apos;s her .
she &apos;s picking up her mother , then she &apos;ll be here .
how &apos;s the search for the hit @-@ and @-@ run car coming ?
not good . there are a lot of blue impalas .
i was about to go through the rest of these .
i found a lot of parents who complained about mr. sutton .
here &apos;s a sample .
&quot; he ignores male students and caters to the girls ,
even though the boys are better at science . &quot;
tell that to the two smartest scientists i know --
my mom and dr. isles .
yeah .
i &apos;ll pull up all of sutton &apos;s class rosters ,
cross @-@ reference those with blue impalas .
good idea .
wait . this might be something .
what is it ?
two years ago , he had to expel one of his best students
&apos;cause he found weed in her lab cubby .
got a name ?
karine alberts .
she was on target to be class valedictorian .
she &apos;s still local .
maybe she blames sutton .
hey , mind if i take a meeting downstairs ?
a meeting ?
i &apos;ll make it quick .
yeah , yeah . go on .
i &apos;ll let jane know we &apos;re gonna grab
our failed valedictorian and bring her in .
so cool of you to meet me at work .
so cool that you &apos;re a cop .
i &apos;m actually a detective in homicide .
wow . even cooler .
is it okay to ask what you &apos;re working on ?
a high @-@ school teacher that died in a hit @-@ and @-@ run .
oh , yeah . i heard about that .
i probably shouldn &apos;t say too much more .
i understand .
so , how long you been at boston joe &apos;s ?
two years .
not as impressive as you , but i &apos;m the manager .
i &apos;m putting myself through school .
wow . good for you . what are you studying ?
actually i &apos;m -- - would you like me to , uh , heat your coffee ?
no , thanks .
yeah , i would . thanks .
i couldn &apos;t help but overhear you &apos;re a student .
yeah , i am . graduate student , actually .
wow . wonderful .
mrs. rizzoli , this is neda .
lovely to meet you .
thanks for the refill .
what are you studying ?
business administration .
nice .
what kind of business are you interested in ?
well , actually -- - uh , mrs.rizzoli , you know what ?
i changed my mind .
i think i &apos;ve had enough caffeine , so ...
hey , frost . your quick meeting almost over ?
yeah .
good , &apos; cause jane is upstairs doing your dmv search ,
and we &apos;ve got a suspect to interrogate .
probably should get back to work .
let me walk you out .
you didn &apos;t like mr . sutton very much , did you , karine ?
he &apos;s the reason i wanted to be a marine biologist .
and what soured you on him ?
was it when he found your weed ?
my weed ? no .
it was when he went from being a mentor to a lascivious creep .
&quot; lascivious . &quot; good word .
thanks . learned it at my j.c.
where were you monday night ?
working the graveyard shift at a 7 @-@ eleven .
you seem a little bitter .
he wrecked my life because i wouldn &apos;t ... perform .
perform ?
he wanted me to give him oral sex .
did he rape you , karine ?
no , but he said if i didn &apos;t perform ,
he &apos;d give me a &quot; c , &quot;
and he wouldn &apos;t write a letter of recommendation to college .
and what did you do ?
i told him i was gonna talk to the principal ,
so he planted weed in my stuff ,
and then found it before i could talk to mr . appleton .
did you ever tell anyone ?
it was his word against mine .
i was the druggie
and mr . sutton was the champion of smart , nerdy girls .
i &apos;m surprised i didn &apos;t kill myself .
aww . what a nice little brother .
shut up .
we get each other things when we &apos;re sick or hurt .
hey , i saw you outside with a woman .
she &apos;s hot , man .
is it serious ?
ah , i just met her .
so , how much time do you need ?
oh , okay . this looks promising .
what ?
it &apos;s a good contender for the hit @-@ and @-@ run .
a 2007 navy blue chevy impala
registered to edes high school .
crap .
i don &apos;t have a car .
oh . i got a cruiser i can borrow .
come on . i &apos;ll take you .
all right . thanks .
i &apos;ll be damned . the driver &apos;s ed car .
can you see anything ?
the hood &apos;s dented .
but a lot of bad drivers have had a crack at this poor car .
keys are in the ignition .
there &apos;s a blue thread caught in the shifter .
hmm . bag it .
you think ? gee .
good thing you &apos;re here .
okay .
i &apos;m gonna release the emergency brake and roll it .
ready ?
seeing anything ?
yeah . bumper &apos;s dinged , and i think this is blood .
so , maybe we &apos;re looking for some kid
who was fooling around in the driver &apos;s ed car .
and ran over his teacher .
csru started processing the car .
they &apos;ve already counted 170 separate prints .
we &apos;ll never be able to tie that car to one driver .
how many students learned to drive in it ?
a lot . it &apos;s 6 years old .
jane &apos;s ankle is very swollen .
i made her lie down in my office .
my sister , the slacker .
don &apos;t tell her i told you that .
told us what ?
the turquoise string that you found in the shifter
is embroidery thread .
it &apos;s commonly used to make friendship bracelets .
friendship bracelets ?
so , whoever was driving was probably a teenager .
how do we track that thread ?
there &apos;s a range of theories
as to where friendship bracelets originated .
i think the use of macrame supports arabia ,
although the tribal element suggests
central and south america .
what else do you have for us , dr. isles ?
oh . right .
something did come up in the victim &apos;s tox screen --
viagra .
who takes viagra before a jog ?
and his wife just had a c @-@ section .
can &apos;t imagine why he &apos;d need a greater blood flow to his penis .
i am sure you &apos;re right . didn &apos;t take it for the wife .
and the crime lab traced the key that we found in his pocket .
it &apos;s from a high @-@ security padlock .
our hero teacher suddenly feels a lot less heroic .
so , he pops a viagra ,
tells his wife he &apos;s going jogging ,
and then heads to a high school in the middle of the night ?
i don &apos;t think he was going there
to tutor budding female science students .
what &apos;s this padlock key to ?
we got to tell jane ,
but she &apos;ll want to go to the high school herself .
well , maybe dr. isles can go with her .
you &apos;re the only one she listens to .
she doesn &apos;t listen to me .
yeah , well , if she passes out from the pain ,
at least you &apos;ll know exactly what to do .
i drive fast because i have to walk slow .
well , you shouldn &apos;t be driving at all ,
and you routinely drive
at least 12 miles over the speed limit .
i &apos;m doing three miles an hour , maura .
well , i don &apos;t mean now .
i thought you liked driving the can &apos;o espress &apos;o .
well , people do smile at us .
they get out of the way , too .
this thing is better than a blue light and a siren .
hey , look .
there &apos;s a high @-@ security padlock on that shed .
so ... mr. sutton had his own private space .
what did he use his driver &apos;s ed shed for ?
well , all of his class supplies .
drive &apos;s ed manuals , dvds , handouts .
maura .
what ?
turquoise embroidery thread . our driver was in here .
did you bring a black light ?
yep .
there you go .
thanks .
i &apos;m seeing a lot of bodily fluids .
i think karine was telling the truth .
he was trading grades for sex .
looks like not all of his students said no .
mr. sutton &apos;s driver &apos;s ed rules .
all students will leave their phone
in the basket during class .
samantha cole was also one of his driver &apos;s ed students .
he took all their phones .
yeah .
so , maybe when samantha wouldn &apos;t perform ,
he gave her a &quot; d. &quot;
and then when she threatened
to go to the principal like karine ,
he sent a photo from her phone to his phone
with a suggestive e @-@ mail .
where &apos;s jane ?
in the caffee ?
told her not to move
until she iced her ankle for 12 minutes .
see ? i told you she listens to you .
detective frost , do you have
samantha cole &apos;s lab binder ?
yeah . right there .
but samantha &apos;s in a coma
and her parents have an alibi .
karine &apos;s alibi checked out , too ,
so she didn &apos;t run over mr. sutton , either .
this is impressive for a college student ,
much less a high @-@ school student .
so why did mr. sutton give her that &quot; d &quot; ?
it fits with jane &apos;s theory he was demanding sex for grades .
so , he gave her a &quot; d &quot; when she said no .
maybe somebody besides samantha &apos;s parents
is angry enough to go after sutton .
did she have a boyfriend ?
doesn &apos;t look like it . i &apos;m on her social network sites .
she was constantly posting
photos of her and her friends on candidgram .
why would she post this photo ?
look at the comments .
holy crap . poor kid .
seems like the entire student body
made a point of publicly calling her a slut .
man . kids are mean .
why would a brilliant kid like samantha
put a photo of herself in a bra online ?
she didn &apos;t .
detective frost , did you happen to come across
mr. sutton &apos;s lesson planner ?
yeah . right there . second file box .
okay , here &apos;s his lesson plan
for samantha &apos;s driver &apos;s ed class 11 days ago .
3 : 00 to 4 : 30 p.m. ,
show students &quot; death on the highway &quot;
in room 12 and grade papers in shed .
samantha was watching a film ?
and mr. sutton had her phone .
he always collected his students &apos; phones before class .
jane was right -- sutton knew
she was about to go to the principal and complain .
he went through her phone , looking for something
to discredit her and found that photo .
and attached it to a bogus e @-@ mail ,
sent it to his own phone , then showed it to the principal .
just to make sure his bases were covered ,
he also posted it on candidgram .
girl &apos;s a slut . problem solved .
yeah , look at the date and time it was sent .
it was just a couple of hours
before samantha attempted suicide .
frost , hit that link -- the one that says &quot; sweet 16 . &quot;
happy birthday ! happy birthday !
i met these girls at the crime scene .
show us your new bra .
no .
yeah , come on !
you guys have to turn your phones off , okay ?
remember , we promised that we wouldn &apos;t post stuff
without each other &apos;s permission , right ?
okay , okay !
samantha &apos;s saying , &quot; don &apos;t post this . &quot;
now show us .
this is silly !
come on ! you &apos;ve been waiting a long time for your girls !
because she &apos;s with her friends .
that photo wasn &apos;t for mr. sutton .
they look like women , but they &apos;re just kids .
that photo couldn have been more incent .
open the one that says &quot; fab four . &quot;
you guys ready ?
i have your back , and you have mine .
i &apos;m there . we &apos;re square .
till the end , we &apos;re friends .
fab four ! i would die for you !
look at their wrists .
turquoise embroidery thread .
those are friendship bracelets .
&quot; i would die for you . &quot;
i wonder if that also means , &quot; i would kill for you . &quot;
d.a. wants us in the squad room .
but there &apos;s no evidence
that puts one of these three girls behind the wheel ?
we found all three girls &apos; prints in the car .
whose are on the steering wheel ?
wheel was wiped clean .
what about evidence on the victim &apos;s body ?
no , nothing that connects him to one of them .
alibis ?
each girl has one .
each of their parents said they saw her
in bed the night of the hit @-@ and @-@ run .
at least they &apos;re all cooperating .
i mean , go figure . i got a 16 @-@ year @-@ old .
can &apos;t even get her to unload the dishwasher .
they all refused to have either a lawyer or a parent present .
not very smart .
that &apos;s 16 for you .
i even tried to talk them into having a lawyer present .
and i &apos;m on the other side .
we need to know who was driving .
yeah , they &apos;re best friends now ,
but human nature says they &apos;ll turn on each other pretty quick .
they always do .
i mean , david sutton is a predator ,
but it does look like one of these girls mowed him down .
well , let &apos;s split up . each take a girl .
it &apos;s gonna be like shooting fish in a bucket .
we have evidence that you were in the shed with mr. sutton .
he was my hero .
he made me fall in love with science .
he -- he said that it was an art and that we were the artists .
what were you doing in that shed ?
i had to record him .
why ?
because he said that he &apos;d give you a better grade
if you had sex with him ?
yeah .
he said that ...
he &apos;d fail me unless i gave him
oral sex .
can you talk me through what happened ?
he told me meet him at 11 : 00 .
i turned my cellphone on
to record him .
and i stuck it in my shirt pocket .
and then what happened ?
i turned my cellphone on .
what did you do ?
i put it in my shirt pocket to record him .
he pulled his sweatpants down .
his legs were so gross .
what did he say to you ?
it &apos;s all you have to do .
you do that ...
i &apos;ll change your grade to an &quot; a. &quot;
how simple is that ?
i &apos;d heard he did it to smart girls ,
that a few even did it
just so that he didn &apos;t wreck their college applications .
he started with samantha .
he gave her a &quot; d. &quot;
but she still didn &apos;t do it ,
so he made everyone think that she was a big slut .
that &apos;s why she tried to kill herself .
why meet him alone ?
i just wanted to make sure
that he never did it to another girl .
no one will believe me without proof .
so , what did he do ?
he pulled down his underwear .
and he tried to touch my breast .
and that &apos;s when my phone fell out .
are you taping this ?
where is that recording ?
i erased it .
why ?
because ...
because of what happened next ?
yeah .
i ran out into the parking lot .
he always left the keys to the driver &apos;s ed car
in the ignition .
i just had to get away . i was so scared .
where did you go ?
he was running after me .
i got to the car ,
but i was so freaked out that ...
i forgot how to drive .
wait . what are you doing ?
he ran in front of the car ...
and i didn &apos;t see him .
i hit him .
megan confessed .
emma confessed , too .
so did chloe .
oh , god .
all three confessed ?
identical stories .
they worked this out , and there is no doubt in my mind
that all three are willing to take the blame and go to jail .
i &apos;ve never seen anything like it .
we even went back at them , hard .
they &apos;re not giving each other up .
so , then , they did it .
or one of them did .
do you think it was deliberate ?
no .
i think it was an accident ,
and the skid marks actually could mean two things .
either the car was lying in wait
or two scared teenagers skidded
to a stop to pick up a friend .
it explains the acceleration marks .
whoever was driving jumped on the gas to get away from sutton .
and the headlights were off
because they were inexperienced drivers .
well , if that &apos;s the case ,
then they didn &apos;t see him ,
and he didn &apos;t see them .
without corroborating evidence
or a confession and two witnesses ,
there is no case .
i need to know the truth .
only one of you was driving that car .
who was it ?
me . i was driving .
if you weren &apos;t driving ,
you &apos;re not responsible .
tell me the truth .
it was me . i was the one .
i was driving .
you understand that you will go to prison .
and you will stay there ...
... for the next 15 years of your life .
yes .
yes .
yes .
can &apos;t you prosecute all three ?
according to massachusetts law ,
we can only go after the driver .
we need one . we &apos;ve got three .
so , what do we do ?
send them home to do their homework .
we can &apos;t do that .
he &apos;s right . we have no choice .
we got to let them go .
try again .
come on , sam .
open your eyes , sam . come on .
she &apos;s trying to open her eyes .
samantha ! honey , can you hear me ?
it &apos;s not really like the movies , is it ?
no .
it &apos;ll be a long haul .
but she &apos;s responding , so who knows ?
she might come all the way back .
i have your back , and you &apos;ve got mine .
it &apos;s beautiful , though .
i &apos;m there .
what is ?
we &apos;re square .
till the end ...
that kind of friendship .
... we &apos;re friends .
i would die for you .
i mean , i don &apos;t know that i &apos;d die for you ,
but i &apos;d -- i &apos;d come damn close .
me , too , jane .
me , too .
