vampires and werewolves used to roam freely
until a shaman put a curse on them to limit their power .
since then , werewolves can only turn on a full moon ,
and vampires are weakened by the sun .
the werewolf part of the curse is sealed with the moonstone .
so tell me about your ex , katherine .
you must be elena .
how do we look exactly alike ?
damon , don &apos;t .
you need me . elena &apos;s in danger .
the moonstone is what breaks the curse .
sacrifice is what breaks it ,
the blood of the doppelganger .
you &apos;re the doppelganger .
i wanna be with you , stefan ,
but first i need to wake up
and know that the people that i love are safe .
you were running from something . what was it ?
everyone has a past .
the originals , rose and i pissed &apos; em off .
what did you do ?
he trusted katerina petrova .
elijah , i beg your forgiveness .
hello , elena .
stefan here ?
he called , said it was important .
right this way .
what is this about ?
you .
ok , you have to understand i only know
what i &apos;ve picked up over the years .
and i don &apos;t know what &apos;s true and what &apos;s not true .
that &apos;s the problem with all this vampire crap .
but klaus , i know is real .
who is he ?
one of the originals . he &apos;s a legend .
from of the first generation of vampires .
like elijah .
no . elijah was the easter bunny compared to klaus .
he was a foot soldier .
klaus is the real deal .
klaus is known to be the oldest .
ok , so you &apos;re saying that the oldest vampire
in the history of time is coming after me ?
yes .
no .
what they &apos;re saying is-- i mean ,
if what she &apos;s saying is true ...
which it is .
and you &apos;re not just saying it
so we don &apos;t kill you ... which i &apos;m not .
then we &apos;re lookin &apos; at a solid maybe .
look , elijah &apos;s dead , right ?
so no one else even knows that you exist .
not that you know of .
that &apos;s not helping .
look , i &apos;ve never even met anyone who &apos;s laid eyes on him .
i mean , we &apos;re talking centuries of truth mixed with fiction .
i mean , we don &apos;t know what &apos;s real .
for all we know , he could just be some sort of stupid bedtime story .
he &apos;s real , and he doesn &apos;t give up .
if he wants something , he gets it .
if you &apos;re not afraid of klaus , then you &apos;re an idiot .
all right , we &apos;re shaking .
you &apos;ve made your point .
where you going ?
school .
i &apos;m late .
let me , uh--let me grab my stuff . i &apos;ll go with you .
that &apos;s ok . i know where it is .
she &apos;s in denial .
shut up , damon .
here . i got it .
thanks .
where &apos;s elena ?
she &apos;s , um-- she &apos;s actually runnin &apos; late today .
so what are you doin &apos; later ?
you wanna hang out at the grill , shoot some pool ?
winner runs the table .
um , why ?
why what ?
well , you never asked me to play a game of pool before ,
so why now ?
uh , i don &apos;t know . i thought--
thought it would be fun . never mind .
no . hey , ok .
sure . it &apos;s just ...
just what ?
it &apos;s just you &apos;re elena &apos;s brother , and ...
sure .
it &apos;s just i &apos;m really bad at pool .
yeah . yeah , i thought you might be .
excuse me .
do you guys know which way &apos;s the office ?
uh , yeah . yeah . through the double doors ,
uh , straight ahead , quick left ,
and then your first right . you must be new here .
yeah , i am . it &apos;s kinda hard to hide it .
my name &apos;s luka .
i &apos;m jeremy . this is bonnie .
hi , bonnie .
anyway , luka , i &apos;m , uh-- i &apos;m actually headed in that direction .
why don &apos;t you follow me ?
it could get confusing .
ok , thanks , man .
it &apos;s nice to meet you , bonnie .
tell everyone i wasn &apos;t feeling well and i went home from school .
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m agreeing to this .
i &apos;m a terrible liar .
and keep stefan busy .
i don &apos;t want him knowing what i &apos;m up to .
i &apos;m even worse at duplicity , and you know this .
you managed to keep me occupied
when katherine paid stefan a visit .
yeah , &apos; cause she threatened me .
not that i &apos;m saying that you should use that as a tactic . it &apos;s ...
stefan &apos;s gonna see right through me .
caroline , as my friend , do you promise or not ?
you had to break out the girlfriend code .
ok .
i promise .
ok .
why don &apos;t you want stefan to know ?
because he would never be ok with me doing this .
are you sure you wanna do this ?
yes , i &apos;m sure .
she &apos;s the only one who knows the truth about klaus ,
the only one who can tell me how to stop him .
but you &apos;re asking for the truth from someone who &apos;s probably never given it .
are you sure about this ?
yes . i can &apos;t just sit back and wait .
i have to know , caroline .
please .
katherine .
i &apos;ll be ok from here .
hello , elena .
you come to watch me wither away ?
good @-@ bye , caroline .
as long as i stay on this side of the door , she can &apos;t hurt me .
please .
stefan know you &apos;re here ?
i brought you some things .
you came to bribe me ?
what is it that you want ?
i want you to tell me about klaus .
you &apos;ve been busy .
i also brought you this .
it &apos;s your family history .
it says in here that the family line ended with you .
obviously that &apos;s not true .
you think that if you brought me some family keepsake ,
that i &apos;d open up ?
i also brought you this .
you don &apos;t look so good .
how long before your body shuts down ?
10 , 20 years ?
must be painful to desiccate and mummify .
i can &apos;t even imagine .
you have the petrova fire .
more blood ?
it &apos;s a long story ,
klaus and i ,
goes all the way back to england , 1492,
after i left bulgaria .
or was thrown out .
thrown out ?
my family , your true ancestors ...
they disowned me .
my indiscretions were not tolerated at that time .
i had a baby out of wedlock . the shame .
it was kept secret ?
my baby was given away .
i was banished to england ,
and i had to learn to adjust .
so i quickly became english .
it was there that i caught the eye of a nobleman named klaus .
i was taken with him at first ,
until i found out what he was
and what he wanted from me ...
and then i ran like hell .
she &apos;s here .
katerina !
i know you &apos;re near !
i can smell your blood .
it &apos;s pointless to run .
klaus &apos;ll find you wherever you are .
this way .
there &apos;s more blood over there .
head east .
i can &apos;t lead them astray much longer .
i can &apos;t run anymore .
another mile .
there &apos;s a cottage .
you &apos;ll be safe there .
go now . go !
so ...
what did klaus want ?
same thing that he &apos;ll want from you .
he wants to break the curse .
by sacrificing the petrova doppelganger .
he wanted to drain every single drop of blood from my body .
all right , rosebud .
i need some answers .
oh , please don &apos;t tell me you &apos;re crying &apos; cause your buddy trevor lost his head .
you always been this sensitive ?
the vampire switch is ... for this very reason .
takes the emotion out of it .
yeah , you switch yours , i &apos;ll switch mine .
is that a dig ?
it &apos;s an observation .
being in love with your brother &apos;s girlfriend must be difficult .
i &apos;m not in love with anyone .
you wanna try that again ?
don &apos;t get on my bad side .
then show me your good side .
how do i find klaus ?
you don &apos;t find klaus . he finds you .
come on . somebody &apos;s gotta know somebody
who knows where he is , right ?
add another 200 somebodies to that ,
and you &apos;re still not even close .
humor me . you got in touch with elijah .
how &apos;d you do it ?
through a very low somebody on the totem pole .
a guy named slater in richmond .
perfect . i &apos;ll drive .
no . you forget not all of us can do sun .
then you drive .
come on .
stefan !
um , i need to talk to you . where are you going ?
well , elena went home sick .
i just want to go check up on her .
ditcher .
i &apos;m kinda worried about her .
you know what ? of course you are .
go ahead . i--you know what ? we can talk later .
uh , talk about what ?
i might have done something .
what did you do ?
told tyler i &apos;m a vampire .
what does the petrova bloodline have to do with klaus ?
it &apos;s really tedious , but ...
the curse was bound by the sacrifice of petrova blood .
witches are crafty with their spells .
the doppelganger was created as way to be able to undo the spell .
once the doppelganger reappeared , the curse can be broken .
so you ran before he killed you .
something like that .
help . please help me .
please . help me .
i don &apos;t invite strangers into my home .
no . trevor , he said that you &apos;d help me .
damn him . always making promises i don &apos;t want to keep .
let the girl in .
bring her water and something to eat .
you must be rose . thank you .
trevor said to show you this to prove i am who i say ,
that you would help me to freedom .
you stole this from klaus ?
it was to be part of the sacrifice ritual .
so i--i grabbed it and made my escape .
people do not escape from klaus .
everyone who tries ends up back in his grasp ,
and anyone who helps them dies .
i know the risk you bring on yourself by giving me aid .
i am risking nothing . at nightfall ,
i will bring you back to klaus and beg him to show us both mercy .
no !
back entrance . how convenient .
that &apos;s the point . we can &apos;t all have little daylight rings .
how do you know this slater guy &apos;s even here ?
i called him .
he &apos;s here . he &apos;s always here .
good . just one thing .
if you are setting me up in any way ,
i will rip your heart out and shove it down your throat .
it &apos;s something i &apos;m very good at .
i &apos;m older than you and stronger .
don &apos;t get on my bad side .
you can trust me .
whoa . what about the , uh ... sunlight
double @-@ paned and tempered .
uv rays can &apos;t penetrate .
you see the appeal now ?
that and the free wi @-@ fi .
hey . how are you ?
good . i saw you come . what are you doin &apos; here ?
mmm , it &apos;s a long story , but i want you to meet--
damon salvatore .
turned 1864 , mystic falls , by katherine pierce ,
aka katerina petrova .
so i take it i was right .
what i told you about the tomb under the church is true .
yes . it was right . thank you for the tip .
yeah . it &apos;s nice to meet you .
maybe .
what &apos;s goin &apos; on , rose ?
where &apos;s , uh , trevor ?
rose never ended up taking you back to klaus , did she ?
no .
but not because she had a change of heart .
it &apos;s nightfall .
time to go .
when did this happen ?
mmm . in the woods .
i tripped .
that &apos;s a lie . i would have smelled it .
i &apos;d rather die than go back to klaus .
please just let me die .
if you die , then trevor dies with you .
no . no !
where is she ?
you set us both on a path of death .
i only hope that klaus sees the honor
in returning that girl to him .
he will sacrifice her .
then so be it !
i love her , rose .
he &apos;ll kill you .
he will not stop until he has all of our heads .
then we shall run until we die .
you killed yourself ?
klaus needed a human doppelganger .
as a vampire , i was no longer in use to him .
but it didn &apos;t work .
you didn &apos;t really escape .
you &apos;ve been running from klaus ever since .
i underestimated his spirit for vengeance .
but living out of a suitcase is better than dying
so that you could have your blood spilled over some silly little rock .
what &apos;s wrong ?
afraid i &apos;m right ?
you don &apos;t wanna die ?
there &apos;s another way out .
better hurry . your opportunity is going ,
going , going ...
and gone .
i made the other choice .
what did you do , katerina ?
i would have helped you live .
you would have helped me run .
that was never going to be enough .
it was enough for me .
do you not see , trevor ?
she used you to help her escape and me to turn her .
klaus will see our role in this .
and for that , i &apos;m sorry .
as am i ...
for this .
please understand ...
you have just signed our death sentence .
better you die than i.
rose and trevor spent the last 500 years
running because you used them .
trevor just got killed .
never thought he would have lasted that long .
you don &apos;t even care that you ruined their lives .
i was looking out for myself , elena .
i will always look out for myself .
if you &apos;re smart , you &apos;ll do the same .
sorry to drag you here , but if i don &apos;t eat ,
i get those &quot; killing some people &quot; urges .
tyler totally has those , too , by the way .
yeah , what else did you say to him ?
not much .
i was trying to keep the questions to a minimum .
are you mad ?
yes , caroline . as a matter of fact , i am a little mad .
i mean , you put yourself at risk . if damon finds out--
but you &apos;re not gonna tell him , are you ?
no , of course not .
he would kill you .
always lookin &apos; out for me .
yeah . well , you don &apos;t exactly make it very easy on me .
then why do you do it ?
why are you such a good friend to me ?
i don &apos;t know . i guess you , uh--
you remind me of someone ,
my , uh-- my best friend , lexi .
you have a friend ?
you say that with such a--
a discouraging amount of surprise , caroline .
no , i just--sorry . i just ...
tell me about her .
i will some other time .
i gotta go .
wait , no . um , what do we do about tyler ?
i--i don &apos;t want damon to kill him ,
&apos;cause there &apos;s a full moon coming up ,
and tyler &apos;s totally freaking out about it .
hey , bonnie .
hey . luka .
how was your first day ?
it was great .
i would like to introduce you to my dad .
hi . i &apos;m bonnie bennett .
dr. martin . jonas martin .
it &apos;s nice to meet you , bonnie bennett .
would you like to join us ?
oh , i &apos;m--i &apos;m meeting a friend .
but he &apos;s not here yet , so ...
sure .
oh , yes . please have a seat .
so , um , where &apos;d you move from ?
louisiana .
that &apos;s a big change .
i &apos;ll say .
it &apos;s not so bad here .
it &apos;s lookin &apos; up .
bennett , huh ?
i knew some bennetts
when i did my residency in massachusetts .
do you have any family from salem ?
actually , i do .
what do you know ? small world , right ?
oh . there &apos;s my friend .
it was nice to meet you , dr. martin .
i will see you at school .
yeah .
sorry i was late . you ok ?
yeah .
and you &apos;re sure that elijah &apos;s dead ?
beyond dead .
trevor was a good man ,
helped me with my dissertation on sexual deviance in the baroque period .
i was going for my psych phd .
slater &apos;s been in college since &apos; 74 .
when i was turned ,
i have 18 degrees--
3 master &apos;s , and 4 phds .
the point ?
exactly . i mean , what is the point ?
what should i be doing with my eternity ?
if you have an answer , please enlighten me .
we need your help .
if someone wanted to get in touch with klaus ,
how would you hook &apos; em up ?
craigslist .
really ?
seriously .
i respond to a personal ad
that gets sent to somebody who
knows somebody who knows elijah ,
who &apos;s dead ,
and that &apos;s where my connection ends .
man , you are bad .
i told you .
all right . well , feel free to cheat if you need your dignity back .
come on . hit the ball .
all right , hey , i got winner , guys .
i got winner .
get ready . this slaughter &apos;s almost over .
so where &apos;s your dad ?
um , i &apos;ll see him back home .
ok . now i &apos;m leaving .
wait . um ...
no , no , no . caroline ,
you have 2 seconds to come clean .
what do you mean ?
i &apos;d believe the whole innocent act a little bit better if i didn &apos;t know how good you were
at providing a distraction on demand .
where &apos;s elena ?
i can &apos;t tell you .
you can &apos;t tell me ? are you kidding me ?
i &apos;m sorry , but i--
i can &apos;t tell you .
caroline , elena was kidnapped ,
she could have been killed ,
and you &apos;re seriously not gonna tell me where she is ?
she &apos;s not in any danger .
i would not have let her put herself in danger .
put herself in danger where ? what do you--
she &apos;s with damon , isn &apos;t she ?
eww . no .
then where-- where is she ?
listen . if you &apos;re my friend ,
like you &apos;ve been pretending to be all day ,
then you &apos;ll tell me where she is .
stefan , i am your friend ,
but i &apos;m also elena &apos;s friend , and i &apos;m sorry ,
but i &apos;m not going to tell you where she is .
so how much of your little story is true ?
i have no reason to lie , elena .
i have no reason to do anything
but sit here and read and rot .
ok , so you mean it &apos;s even partially true .
that &apos;s the reason why you came back , isn &apos;t it ?
because you wanted to be the one to hand me over to klaus .
mm , 500 years on the run ,
i figured maybe he &apos;d be willing to strike a deal .
so you got mason lockwood to find you the moonstone .
right again .
what else is needed to break the curse ?
mmm . look who &apos;s getting smarter .
it &apos;s not just me or the stone , is it ?
otherwise , there would be no reason to trigger tyler lockwood &apos;s werewolf curse .
witches and their spells--
so many ingredients , so many people to sacrifice .
so you need a werewolf .
believe it or not , they &apos;re hard to come by .
what else ?
a witch to do the spell .
mine bailed , but bonnie &apos;ll do just fine .
what else ?
vampire .
caroline .
could have been anyone , i suppose ,
but i like the poetry of caroline .
so you were gonna just hand us all over to be killed ?
better you die than i.
here &apos;s what i don &apos;t get .
elijah moves around during the day ,
which means the original people
knew the secret of the day ring .
now , why would klaus want to lift the curse of the sun and the moon ?
to keep the werewolves from lifting it .
if a vampire breaks the sun curse ,
then the werewolves are stuck with the curse of the moon forever ,
and vice versa .
but werewolves are all but extinct .
true . i &apos;ve never seen one , but rumor has it--
not such a rumor .
mystic falls ?
god , i &apos;ve got to visit this place .
it sounds awesome .
awesome doesn &apos;t even begin to describe it .
can we stop the curse from being broken at all ?
well , what do you mean ?
well , if we rendered the moonstone useless
and stopped the curse from being broken .
well , yeah , probably ,
but why would you wanna do that ?
tell me how .
you think i &apos;m going to help you figure out
how to do something that would piss off an original ?
and keep me from walking in the sun ?
you wanna walk in the sun ?
i can make that happen ,
if you help us .
you &apos;re gonna be ok .
i know . i just--
who was behind that ?
i don &apos;t know . where &apos;s slater ?
iowa by now . who the hell knows ?
he &apos;s not behind this . he &apos;s a good guy .
he wouldn &apos;t betray me .
then who did it ?
it &apos;s klaus . don &apos;t you understand ?
you don &apos;t know this man . i &apos;m dead .
we &apos;re all dead .
hey , bonnie .
i &apos;m sorry about earlier .
my dad , he &apos;s not very subtle .
the whole , uh , bennett , salem question .
he picked up on you .
he was just fishing around .
he didn &apos;t mean any harm .
i felt something , too .
i know . that &apos;s why
we &apos;re having this conversation right now .
he , uh ...
doesn &apos;t like for anyone to know .
but we were both worried that you would nail us .
he just wants us to fit in here
for once .
it &apos;s tough , bonnie , bein &apos; different .
you &apos;re a witch ?
well , we prefer the term warlock .
elena .
stefan . what are you doing here ?
i could ask you the same question .
caroline told you .
no . she kept your secret ,
but it didn &apos;t take long for me to figure out
what was so important that you &apos;d have to keep it from me .
i knew that you &apos;d stop me .
listen to me .
whatever she said to you is a lie .
do not listen to her . she is a liar , elena .
what if she isn &apos;t ?
you didn &apos;t hear what she said .
you don &apos;t have to worry .
i &apos;m not gonna let anything happen to you .
that &apos;s the problem .
you won &apos;t ...
but you &apos;ll die trying . how is that any better ?
there &apos;s nothing you can do , stefan .
i haven &apos;t even told you the best part of the story .
no . no .
no , mama .
no !
no !
he killed them ,
my entire family ,
just to get back at me for running .
whatever you do to escape klaus ,
he will get his vengeance on your friends , your family ,
on anyone that you &apos;ve ever loved .
no . look at me .
no . do not listen to her , ok ?
always the protector .
but even you must realize that she &apos;s doomed .
there &apos;s nothing you can do to stop it .
unless of course you have this .
what ?
oh , no . there it is .
that &apos;s the ultimate lie , isn &apos;t it ?
you spun this whole thing
so that we would have to get the stone from you , didn &apos;t you ?
i didn &apos;t spin anything , stefan . it &apos;s the truth .
no . let me guess .
you wanna trade that stone for your freedom .
you manipulative , psychotic bitch .
my freedom ?
that &apos;s where you &apos;re wrong , stefan .
i don &apos;t want my freedom ,
&apos;cause when klaus shows up to kill us all--and he will ...
i &apos;ll be in the tomb , where no vampire will enter ,
because they can &apos;t get out .
i &apos;ll be the safest psychotic bitch in town .
i &apos;m sorry about today .
i didn &apos;t know that was gonna happen .
i believe you .
i wish we could save elena .
i know that you want to .
and i will .
you remind me of trevor .
why ? why him ?
because he always talked a big game ,
he was always working an angle ,
but underneath it all , he was the best friend anyone could ever hope for .
hmm . where &apos;d that get him ?
dead .
and my loyalty to him almost got me dead , too .
to friendship .
you &apos;re right to fight it ...
the way you feel about her .
and why is that ?
because if we want to survive ,
we need to not care about anyone .
caring gets you dead , huh ?
it might just be time to turn the switch off on your emotions .
i will if you will .
elena .
i can &apos;t talk about it , stefan .
you have to . don &apos;t shut me out .
elena , please .
i wanted to know the truth , stefan , and i got it .
it &apos;s not just me that &apos;s in danger .
i @-@ it &apos;s caroline , and it &apos;s tyler , and it &apos;s bonnie .
they &apos;re all part of breaking the curse .
i can &apos;t blame anyone else anymore ,
because it &apos;s not because you came into town
or because you and i fell in love .
that &apos;s not why everyone that i love is in danger .
it &apos;s because of me . everything is because of me .
it &apos;s a lie , you know .
there &apos;s no switch you can turn off .
sure , when you &apos;re a newbie ,
but after a couple hundred years ...
you just have to pretend .
hello .
rose ?
slater .
are you ok ?
yes . i--i took off .
i &apos;m sorry . i was friggin &apos; freaked .
no . i &apos;m sorry to involve you .
look , i want no part in any of this ,
but i did some digging .
ok . what did you find ?
you can destroy the curse ,
but you need the moonstone .
how ? what do you mean ? i don &apos;t follow .
well , can your friend get the moonstone ? you need it .
yes . he could get it .
what next ?
we need a witch .
g @-@ get the moonstone .
a witch should be able to figure out the rest .
good luck , rose .
very nicely done .
thanks . i &apos;ve a degree in theater .
how can you compel me ?
a vampire can &apos;t compel another vampire .
i &apos;m a special vampire .
what , because you &apos;re an original ?
now , i want you to take this and drive it through your heart .
but that would k @-@ kill me forever .
i know .
but it &apos;s necessary .
was it , really ?
it had to be done .
he delivered his message .
