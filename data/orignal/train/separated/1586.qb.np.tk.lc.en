i think we both know that she &apos;s everything that i &apos;m not .
and nothing that i wanna be .
so really you just wanted to use me ... for sex .
i thought you were different .
what do i have to do to prove it to you ?
it &apos;s about dani .
what happened ?
we had sex .
... and i , we &apos;re working the program together .
i pray i can do better for this baby ,
than i did for my twins .
sorry i was being such a bitch .
i &apos;m having a hard time right now .
no , you &apos;re allowed .
what &apos;s going on with you ?
is it wyatt ?
we &apos;re kinda taking a break .
idyllwild would like to offer you a full ride
to their summer music program .
yeah , i know , it &apos;s just one
of the most prestigious programs in the country .
i can &apos;t sign the papers again . i can &apos;t abandon you .
i love you .
i don &apos;t love you .
i &apos;m never getting adopted .
you don &apos;t know that .
so , i &apos;m not gonna graduate ?
no , that is not what we &apos;re saying .
but i took world history at jefferson .
and obviously i took algebra ,
i &apos;m in algebra ii now .
yes , i know , and i &apos;m gonna
do everything i can to find those transcripts ,
and get those credits , but ...
so i &apos;m gonna have to take all of these classes over again ?
hopefully not . but even if i do find all of your records ,
you &apos;re still gonna need to go to summer school .
awesome .
and we should probably come up with some kind of
independent study project for you .
we know this is unfair ,
and i wish we could just , fix everything , love ...
it &apos;s out of your hands . yeah , i get it .
with a plan , we can get you through this .
yeah , unless i have to live with the quinns ,
and i &apos;m going to some private school
where they tell me my credits
from anchor beach didn &apos;t even transfer .
we &apos;re not going to let robert ,
or anyone else , take you out of this house .
cps took me when your
your foster license expired ,
and there was nothing you could do about that .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m just ...
we know . we know .
so guess who got the highest score in her grade
on the math evaluations ! ninety @-@ eight !
that &apos;s incredible , mariana .
great job ! you &apos;re amazing .
we &apos;re sorry , honey , that is amazing .
we are very proud of you .
that &apos;s awesome .
i guess i &apos;ll just have to wait until they announce my name
at the assembly this week to get the props i deserve .
honey , really ?
i &apos;m kidding , it &apos;s fine .
but guess what else ? you know craig ,
craig the math teacher ?
he wants me to join stem .
well that sounds fun .
what is it ?
uh , science , technology ,
something , and math .
it &apos;s like computer club , but like a team or something .
and they go to like , coding competitions and stuff .
it &apos;s kind of a big deal .
if you do say so yourself .
well , apparently no one else is going to .
ok , when &apos;s dinner ? i &apos;m starved .
in a few minutes , go ahead and go wash up .
ok .
can i ... ?
yeah .
we love you .
i love you , too .
god , i hate seeing her like this .
she &apos;s ... looks so defeated .
yeah , well , can you blame her ?
it &apos;s just been one thing after another for her .
no , i know , but
we have got to help her graduate .
graduating from high school is the
single most important thing that a foster kid can do .
a foster kid ? that &apos;s what we &apos;re calling her now ?
well ,
until the court decides otherwise , it &apos;s what she is .
hello ?
what ?
ok , slow down .
stef , stef ...
i need your help .
you don &apos;t wanna hurt anyone !
we don &apos;t have ...
where the hell is it ? !
come on , man , before you hurt someone .
police ! drop it , drop the knife !
drop the knife ! drop the knife ! get on the ground !
on the ground !
ok , ok .
both of you , on the ground now !
on the ground !
we live here !
you two , down ,
there are kids here !
both of you , on the ground , now !
where are they ?
where are the kids ?
i ...
where are they ? !
the bedroom .
face down , on the ground .
is anybody in there ?
hands behind your back . i said hands behind your back .
hello .
um ... listen , the police are here , and you &apos;re safe , you &apos;re fine .
can you , uh , can you open the door ?
hi , honey .
i &apos;m with the police , you see my badge right there ?
can you open up the door ?
yeah ?
he was talking all kinds of crazy ,
saying they stole his stash ,
and next thing you know , he pulls a knife .
so i grabbed the girls , locked us in the bedroom , and called you .
why didn &apos;t your foster parents call the police ?
i don &apos;t know . he &apos;s their friend or somethin &apos; .
the sketchy guy ?
damn . i mean ,
i &apos;ve been in some bad foster homes before , but
never anything like that .
well , at least you &apos;re safe now .
yeah , tonight ,
who knows where they gonna put me next .
what about you ?
what &apos;s going on with you ?
well , robert &apos;s trying to get custody .
for real ?
yeah , i have to have visitations with him
every week .
it &apos;s not the same as you , like , at all ,
but i keep thinking , like maybe ,
maybe now , maybe this time ,
i &apos;ll be out of the system for good , you know ?
and they just keep ...
pulling me back .
i just wanna be in one place for a while , you know ?
even if it ain &apos;t as nice as this one .
i hope ...
i hope you get that .
stoned much ?
planning to go to class ?
so you trying to get kicked out of school ?
what the hell do you care ?
please don &apos;t tell me you &apos;re not acting like this
because we broke up .
yeah , callie ,
you &apos;re the reason for every single thing that i do .
ok , i don &apos;t even wipe the sleep outta my eyes in the morning
without wondering what you &apos;re going think about it .
peace .
well ?
not the best falafel in san diego .
what ? you cannot be serious .
a close second .
to mine .
well , i will be the judge of that .
next time , you &apos;re bringing lunch .
mmm , ok .
we need to do this more often . it &apos;s been too long .
i know .
i &apos;ve been meaning to check in with you ,
but um ...
... after you lost the baby , i ...
i just didn &apos;t know what to say .
it &apos;s ok .
i get it .
and how about you ?
are you , ok ?
i am , mostly .
work &apos;s a good distraction .
so what do you think about , monty ? so far .
well ,
i had my reservations , as you know ,
but she &apos;s pretty great .
she &apos;s leaving the academics to me ,
and she has some amazing fund @-@ raising ideas .
i think
for the first time in a very long time ,
we &apos;re in good hands .
wow . sounds like she &apos;s really won you over .
i wouldn &apos;t go that far .
look , look , i &apos;m sorry , all right ?
whatever .
i don &apos;t get it , jesus .
you say you like me ,
you say you care about me , and then you just blow me off .
i really wanted you to see me at the dance competition .
no , i just ...
remember , you said we have to be there for people .
i was talking about me . your girlfriend .
i know , but ana ...
your birth mom ?
what about her ?
she &apos;s pregnant , ok ?
the crack @-@ head ?
she &apos;s not a crack @-@ head .
not anymore .
how &apos;d you find out ?
i went to one of her aa meetings .
she was telling everyone .
i got so weirded out . i left before she saw me .
what &apos;d mariana say ?
she doesn &apos;t know , and you can &apos;t tell her .
she &apos;ll freak out , she &apos;ll tell my moms .
and then i &apos;m screwed . ok ?
ok .
i &apos;m still bummed you missed my solo .
you &apos;re gonna have to make it up to me .
promise .
so , who &apos;s the baby daddy ?
what if it &apos;s , mike ?
who &apos;s mike ?
ok , so there are two generals ,
with armies , on either side of a city .
now both armies have to attack at the same time ,
otherwise the lone attacker is defeated .
so , they just have to agree ...
mind if i ...
no .
but , what &apos;re you doing here ?
i was invited .
... if a message has been delivered .
how do you create a formula
to be 100 percent sure
that the armies attack at the same time ?
uh , you can &apos;t .
well , there &apos;s always be some uncertainty .
it &apos;s a trick question , right ?
that &apos;s right .
now , i &apos;m gonna walk the rest of you ...
never woulda thought jesus &apos; sister
would turn out to be a math whiz .
was that even a math question ?
and please tell me you know i &apos;m nothing like my brother .
no , i do .
look ... i &apos;m sorry about how
all that went down .
with hayley and everything .
it &apos;s cool .
don &apos;t worry about it .
if it helps , i like you way better than her .
that does help .
a little .
but i don &apos;t think hayley was even the problem .
i think we were done as soon as
i became his math tutor .
he just couldn &apos;t deal with me being smarter than him .
but i &apos;m glad that you &apos;re here .
between this and wrestling , i was starting to think
that i was the only person in the world without a penis .
and it &apos;s not gonna be some kind of crazy , drug @-@ fueled ,
trashing hotels kinda tour .
we &apos;re just going to be playing like skate parks ,
small clubs maybe a fair if we can book one .
and we &apos;ll crash with friends ,
or sleep in the van if we have to .
or , you know , we &apos;ll set aside enough money to make sure we &apos;re staying in motels .
you know , nice ones . clean ones . like chains .
and i &apos;ll do sat prep online
and i &apos;ll make sure i &apos;m working on my summer reading list in the van .
i mean , most of the our time will be spent driving anyways , so ...
not on freeways or anything like that .
or night , just ...
look , it &apos;s gonna be really cool .
and it &apos;s a chance to see a little bit of the world
while i do something i love .
well , you &apos;ve given us a lot to think about ,
just give us some time .
ok .
all right .
but , you know , as you &apos;re deliberating ,
i just want you to think of this as less of a tour
and more of like a right of passage .
ok .
that &apos;s good . that &apos;s enough . thank you .
all right .
well , that was good for a laugh .
i just mean , come on ,
we &apos;re not gonna let him go on the road . right ?
it &apos;s the summer before his senior year .
colleges are gonna wanna see
an internships and study programs ,
and not from the , sid vicious school of rock &apos;n&apos;roll .
sid vicious ?
you forget , i used to be cool .
all right , so you guys wanna tell him ,
or you want me to take the heat this time ?
well , i mean let &apos;s hold on here for a second ,
i think maybe he should go .
you , what ?
who are you and what have you done with my wife ?
what &apos;s he doing here ?
good to see you , too , jesus .
jesus .
sorry , that came out wrong .
would you like to back up and try that again ?
hey , mike , how &apos;s it going ?
good , bud , how &apos;s wrestling ?
good .
chatty .
teenage .
they reach a verdict ?
still deliberating .
two against one . one being in favor .
wow , poor lena .
having to fend for herself against two cops .
actually , it &apos;s mom .
no way , stef &apos;s pro tour ?
it &apos;s weird , right ? it &apos;s like freaky friday down there .
yeah .
you didn &apos;t tell them about idyllwild , did you ?
no .
yeah , if they find out about that ,
there &apos;s no way they &apos;re letting you go on tour .
don &apos;t worry , i &apos;m not gonna say anything .
sweetheart .
can we talk to you for a moment ?
about ana .
why ?
well , mom told me how hard it was for you ,
when ana made her amends .
i just , don &apos;t like seeing girls cry .
it &apos;s not just about that .
you have a connection with her .
and that &apos;s ok .
what &apos;s not ok is ignoring the fact
that you are a child of an addict .
so if you decide you want to see ana again ,
we &apos;d like you to be prepared .
we want you to start going to alateen meetings .
what is that ? like , aa for teens ?
no , no , no , it &apos;s for teenagers
whose parents or family members ,
are alcoholics or addicts .
it &apos;s just a
way to help you guys figure out how to deal with it all .
do i have to ?
i don &apos;t even know if i want to see ana again .
you say that now .
but in a few weeks , or months ,
who knows how you &apos;re gonna feel ?
hey , mom .
hey , b , good timing . come here , love . come here .
um , you have been to a few alateen meetings , haven &apos;t you ?
yeah , sure .
um ... yeah , it &apos;s super cool . you should totally go .
see , you wouldn &apos;t be in this alone ,
brandon &apos;ll take you .
what ?
why do i have to go ?
because it would be really good for both of you .
so they &apos;re selling kids now , is that it ?
that &apos;s not how i &apos;d describe it .
then how do you explain putting kids in an apartment
where the adults that are responsible for them
are letting meth addicts in the front door ?
stef ...
well , what ?
it &apos;s money , isn &apos;t it ?
i mean , this is exactly why you cannot
privatize things like foster care .
foster care is not privatized .
ok , then what would you call it ?
the county contracts with
some private agencies to place more kids .
there just aren &apos;t enough homes .
and those agencies get paid more based on the number
of homes they find and kids they place . correct ?
so they &apos;re incentivized
to approve people who may or may not be qualified .
well , unfortunately , that &apos;s really not for us to decide .
are you not part of child protective services ?
who else is gonna decide these things , exactly ?
i can &apos;t ... he won &apos;t answer . i don &apos;t understand .
as long as kiara doesn &apos;t have to go back into that house .
you are not sending her back there . are you ?
i know people in vegas . i &apos;ll just go there and lay low .
&quot; lay low &quot; with who ? other runaways ?
you know that &apos;s not gonna work .
i don &apos;t care , i &apos;m not going back to that place !
you &apos;re just gonna end up back in juvie .
ok , look , you don &apos;t see me running .
don &apos;t you get it ?
my foster parents know i narc &apos;d on them .
you think they &apos;re going to welcome be back with open arms ?
so ... i was looking over our api scores .
and can we talk about mariana ?
top in her class in math ? how about that !
i know , pretty great , right ?
we &apos;re so proud of her .
well , the whole school did well in math , in fact ,
it &apos;s very impressive .
thank you .
english on the other hand ,
not so much .
the scores are ... low , and if
we wanna qualify for the kind of grants we need ,
well , we gotta get &apos; em up .
in a fiscal crisis like we &apos;re in , it &apos;s a big issue .
i hear you .
we need to get on top of this right away .
we &apos;ve gotta make some changes to our curriculum ,
as soon as possible ,
so are you up for speaking with timothy ?
i mean since he &apos;s the head of the english department ?
well ?
well , what ?
well ? how was it ?
i want to make sure it &apos;s good before i show it to tia .
oh , it &apos;s good .
it is ?
oh yeah .
it &apos;s sexy .
it is ?
yeah .
you &apos;re sexy .
what ?
nobody &apos;s ever called me sexy before .
well , you are ,
very sexy .
especially when you dance .
what ?
i gotta go , stem .
really ?
maybe i should join stem , i killed it
on the math evaluation .
did you ?
yup .
ninety @-@ two ,
thank you very much .
wow . that &apos;s great .
how &apos;d you do ?
oh , ok .
eighty @-@ eight .
eighty @-@ eight &apos;s super good , above average !
yep , that &apos;s me ,
above average .
ok , gotta go .
bye .
uh , so , i &apos;ve been thinkin &apos; ...
... about the tour .
are you ok ?
yeah , i &apos;m just ...
got a lot on my mind , what &apos;s up ?
what &apos;s going on ?
uh , callie &apos;s friend , kiara
we pulled her out of
a pretty messed up foster home the other night .
and social services is sending her back tomorrow .
well , i wish i could say i find that shocking .
yeah , right .
and then i &apos;m pretty sure they &apos;re dealing .
really ?
yeah , why else would you
let a tweaker into your house in the middle of the night ?
unless you &apos;re planning on doing a little business .
so , i , uh ...
i &apos;m thinking about making a house call .
want some back up ?
what is this ?
i used to go here for group .
it &apos;s like drop @-@ in center for foster kids .
drop in for what ?
like , therapy , support groups , legal help .
hey , there ,
i &apos;m rafael . what can i do for you ?
she &apos;s getting sent back to an abusive foster home ,
her social worker won &apos;t do anything about it ,
so we need to talk to someone who can
help get her a new placement or whatever .
ok .
i &apos;m really sorry to hear at .
um , first , we &apos;ll have to get you a casa ...
that is a court appointed special advocate .
here you go .
but it &apos;s gonna be a few weeks
before we can ...
no , we don &apos;t have weeks .
let &apos;s just go .
no , look , i &apos;m sorry ,
but it &apos;s really important
that we get you on a waitlist . if we ...
a waitlist ?
all we &apos;re ever freaking doing is waiting .
how long we gotta wait for
someone who &apos;s actually going to listen to us ?
someone that &apos;s actually help us .
how long &apos;s that gonna be ?
until we &apos;re 18 ?
i &apos;m sorry ,
i really am .
in the meantime , we could set
up an appointment with a counselor , try to ...
kiara is in a house with drug dealers .
ok , you think a little therapy is gonna help that ?
the main reason we need the therapy
is because we keep getting put
in these screwed up situations in the first place !
this is pointless , let &apos;s go , this is a waste of time .
i don &apos;t understand , we already gave our statements .
well , there were some inconsistencies , for instance ,
you said that you didn &apos;t know the intruder ,
but he seems to know you .
he &apos;s more of an acquaintance .
where does he live ?
in the neighborhood , i think .
actually , he lives in oceanside .
maybe he works around here , i don &apos;t know .
he &apos;s unemployed .
well , like i told you , we barely know him .
then why &apos;d you let him in your house ?
couldn &apos;t you see he was tweaked out of his mind ?
not at first . he seemed fine ...
we didn &apos;t let him in .
like i said in my statement , he forced his way .
so did you let him in or you didn &apos;t ? he says yeah .
he &apos;s a tweaker ,
who can believe anything he says , right ?
no , that he was a tweaker .
you know where he &apos;s getting his drugs ? are you selling him ?
you know what ,
if you want to talk more , get a warrant .
if you wanna do this the hard way , maybe we will .
but let me tell you one thing ...
stef ...
you let one of those foster kids get hurt ,
at all , in any way , you let them come to any harm ,
and i will dedicate my life to ruining yours .
is that a threat ?
no .
no threats .
i know my rights .
thank you for your time .
i &apos;m sure you do .
all that time spent in the prison library ?
i may not be a lawyer , but i do know my rights .
what the hell is wrong with people ?
what the hell is wrong with you ?
you were totally over the line in there , and you know it .
i know this is frustrating as all get out ,
and i know you hate feeling like there &apos;s nothing you can do ,
feeling powerless .
but you can &apos;t go getting yourself in trouble , stef .
you want ia on your ass again ?
ok , thank you .
oh , have you talked to timothy yet ?
not yet , i just , uh , i haven &apos;t had a chance today .
ok , let me know how it goes .
yeah .
oh , you know ,
i &apos;ve been meaning to tell you ,
mariana stopped by my office today .
she did ? why ?
well , she asked me not to announce her during the assembly tomorrow ,
said she didn &apos;t want all the attention .
mariana ? my mariana ?
said she didn &apos;t want attention ?
that girl used to make the whole family clap
every time she put on her shoes .
what is that about ?
you ever wonder
what would &apos;ve happened
if i hadn &apos;t called stef and lena when we were on the roof ?
i only came back because of you , you know that .
that &apos;s not true .
it is true . it &apos;s ...
more true that it should be .
it &apos;s kinda pathetic .
it &apos;s not pathetic .
so are you going to go back to indiana ?
with your mom ?
i &apos;m thinking about it . i don &apos;t know .
maybe this time i &apos;ll just drive .
maybe i &apos;ll hang out in new mexico for a little while ,
see if i can get abducted by aliens .
you know , i don &apos;t think that would be as fun as you think .
how would you know ?
oh , my whole life is kinda like being abducted by aliens .
still ?
well , judge is talking about making me go and live with robert .
seriously ? he &apos;s basically like a stranger .
it wouldn &apos;t be the first time .
so come with me .
oh , uh , sorry .
so monty told me you came to see her today ?
to talk about the assembly tomorrow ?
oh yeah , i was just ,
offering to help out , if ...
you know , if she needed anything .
really ? because that &apos;s not quite what she ...
i guess i misunderstood .
are you done with your homework ?
just getting to it .
don &apos;t forget your math .
so , do i have to talk during this meeting ? or can i just listen ?
up to you .
come on , what should i expect ?
to sit in a room with a bunch of kids talking about
having drunk parents , ok ?
look , i only went once .
and i totally zoned out .
i usually end up getting pizza or something around the corner .
don &apos;t tell moms .
why the hell did you wait so long to tell me that ?
screw alateen , let &apos;s go !
so you wanna help out at the assembly , huh ?
i just , mat was so proud of his math score ,
and i beat him by like six points , and i just ...
just don &apos;t wanna seem smarter than your boyfriend ?
oh , honey ,
if he can &apos;t handle the math genius and the pink nails , well ,
then , he doesn &apos;t deserve you .
don &apos;t play small , my love .
not for him , not for anybody .
you &apos;re already really short .
this girl can &apos;t go more than five minutes without texting me .
she &apos;s like a registered text offender .
why do you put up with it ?
if you don &apos;t like her , then just end it .
i like her , i guess .
she &apos;s really into me .
but it &apos;s not as simple as that .
why not ?
you can &apos;t tell moms .
you know what ? i &apos;m actually trying to go on tour , anyway ,
it &apos;s probably best i don &apos;t know anything about ...
oh , what ?
please tell me that &apos;s not real .
i wish .
what were you thinking , dude ?
i don &apos;t need you to tell me i &apos;m an idiot , ok ?
i already know .
yeah , it was stupid ,
and if moms find out that , you are dead ,
completely dead .
well , i , uh ... i have actually done worse . much worse .
like what ?
come on , i just told you .
it doesn &apos;t matter . let &apos;s just say
i wish that i just had a tattoo .
you know , i think we could
probably still catch most of that meeting
if we hurry .
what &apos;s going on ?
i just found out i have to see robert in a few days .
oh , really ?
yeah . i just thought that
after the whole sophia thing that maybe they &apos;d ,
call it off or something .
she really tried to kill herself ?
why ? she think heaven &apos;s gonna be any nicer than that house ?
yeah ...
sorry . but for real .
why would she do that ?
i think she ...
sometimes it just gets to be too much , you know ?
oh , i know .
of course you do .
i &apos;m gonna be all right , callie .
even if they send me go back to that place ,
i &apos;m gonna be all right .
and i know they &apos;re dealing drugs ,
it &apos;s the most obvious thing in the world , but they &apos;re smart .
we can &apos;t catch &apos; em . and now kiara &apos;s gotta go back there .
what happens when the next tweaker goes crazy ?
what if they have a gun ?
i hate the system so much sometimes .
i mean , they &apos;ll basically start
shipping the kids out
as soon as you can prove you have an extra room .
what ?
standardized tests are worthless , you know that .
i &apos;ve even heard you say it .
i don &apos;t disagree with you that they &apos;ve become too important ,
but they &apos;re the barometer that people use ,
when they &apos;re talking about successful schools .
what people ?
the people who decide who to give grants to .
the people who renew our charter . those people .
timothy , the school is in a financial crisis .
this is one of the things we have to do
to keep the doors open .
and if we wanna grow ...
what do you mean , &quot; grow &quot; ?
what , does monty got some plan to franchise anchor beach ?
this isn &apos;t a fast food restaurant !
look , i took a pay cut
to come to a charter school so i could teach the way i want ,
in the way i think actually makes a difference to the students .
i want these kids to be able to think ,
i &apos;m not gonna make them sit around all day
and regurgitate facts .
i respect that , you know that i do .
but we have to demonstrate that we &apos;re academically on par
with the other schools in the system .
so we &apos;re meant to teach to the test now ?
is that it ?
and where does it stop ?
are we about to get a list of banned books ?
don &apos;t be hyperbolic .
this doesn &apos;t sound like you at all , lena .
i thought you had final say when it came to academics here .
i do .
really ?
&apos;cause it doesn &apos;t seem like that .
they &apos;ve never missed a payment , and they &apos;ve got a year lease ,
so i couldn &apos;t evict them if i wanted to .
how many people did they
say would be living in the apartment , again ?
a husband and wife .
mmm , so they didn &apos;t mention the three foster kids on the lease ?
that sounds like a breech to me .
ok , sure . but i don &apos;t really care .
as long as they don &apos;t have a waterbed , i &apos;m cool .
would you be cool if i told you that
your tenants were under suspicion for selling drugs ?
now we &apos;ll be driving by two or three times a night ,
shining spotlights in their windows
and the windows of everyone else in the building .
how will your other tenants feel about that ?
oh , and , i noticed some code violations .
yes , yeah .
we &apos;re gonna have to send someone
from county down to do an inspection .
i think so .
later .
later .
ninety @-@ eight .
i got a 98 . on the math exams .
wait a sec , you did ?
but why &apos;d you tell me ...
because
even though i &apos;m really smart , i can be super super stupid .
i was afraid that , i dunno , you &apos;d be threatened if ...
if i knew you kicked my ass in math .
you don &apos;t really think much of me , huh ?
no ,
i think you &apos;re awesome .
it &apos;s me i wonder about sometimes .
come on , nerd , walk me to band practice .
so how &apos;d it go ? with timothy ?
not great .
really ? why not ?
i thought you said i had , autonomy ,
when it comes to academics here .
you do .
are you sure about that ?
because i don &apos;t want to completely undermine
the really great work our teachers are doing ,
just to get some test scores up .
lena , i &apos;m not trying to
impose on your authority over the teachers .
i just wanna make sure we get our charter renewed .
and that we qualify for as many funding streams as possible .
ok .
sorry , i ...
and i know that we have to figure out a way to
work the system ,
i get that .
when i said we &apos;re a team , lena , i meant it .
i think you &apos;re an extraordinary educator .
i &apos;m learning so much from you .
thank you .
i respect you , too , i do . i ...
i think i &apos;m a little gun shy ,
after our last principal .
so ...
how did you leave things with timothy ?
well , he said he &apos;s going to
teach the way he wants to teach and that &apos;s that .
well , he &apos;s gonna have to give a little bit .
do you think he &apos;s at all open to that ?
i &apos;m not sure .
well , look , if he &apos;s not willing to work with the administration ,
and teach the prescribed curriculum ...
then we &apos;ll fire him .
hey , callie , kiara ?
anybody home ?
kiara , callie , you in there ?
hello , ladies .
you pack light .
here .
no , that &apos;s ... that &apos;s yours .
it was a gift .
i think you need it more than i do .
i mean , if you &apos;re gonna go ,
gallivanting around the country , you &apos;re gonna
need something to remind you of home , right ?
you &apos;re staying .
you should , too .
but not for me . you should stay for you .
i know you didn &apos;t come back for me , wyatt .
you came back to finish school . so do it .
finish it .
what about you ? you gonna
finish what you started ?
you know , you really only have two choices .
either you give up or you keep trying .
well ,
if there &apos;s one thing i know about you ,
you &apos;re not really the giving up kind .
are you ?
how &apos;s callie ?
she &apos;s sad ... and worried .
i don &apos;t know how much more disappointment she can take
before she runs ... again .
well , at least those other kids
don &apos;t have to go back to that home . that &apos;s a big win .
on a technicality .
meanwhile her friend is out on the street tonight .
doing god knows what to survive .
you think they &apos;ll find her ?
well , hopefully she &apos;ll get arrested
for some minor crime before something worse happens to her .
i &apos;m really sorry , honey .
what would you think about ...
about mike and i partnering again ?
really ?
he drives me crazy , because he knows me so well .
but in a partner , you know that &apos;s a good thing .
i was talking with mike and ...
wait ,
you already talked to mike about this ?
no . i mean , yes , we discussed it , but ,
you know , pending your approval .
i was very clear that it was pending your approval .
can i please think about this ?
of course . i &apos;m not even sure , so ...
in other news ...
yes , please .
i have a small win for you .
oh , for me ?
yes , i was talking to monty .
she &apos;s so swell .
and she convinced me that
sending brandon on tour could be really good ,
even for college .
that it could set him apart from the other applicants .
so , i think we should let him go .
so she said what i said but
because she said it , it &apos;s right ?
yes , exactly .
well , that &apos;s really funny ,
because i was talking with mike and
he convinced me that i was crazy , so there you go .
of course .
don &apos;t worry , i &apos;m not going to go off on you again or anything .
i wouldn &apos;t blame you if you did .
i need your help with something .
ok .
i wanna volunteer .
i have to do some kinda , independent study
for school so i can graduate and i wanna do it here .
i wanna help the kids who need it .
where &apos;s your friend ?
she ran away .
i think we can work something out .
you &apos;re a fighter .
we could always use a good fighter around here .
all righty . well , if you &apos;re going to be volunteering here
i might as well show you around .
ok .
so , here we go .
