Jeez, I hope you're training for something,
or do you just do sprints for fun?
I'm trying to do this triathlon in February.
Oh, yeah. The FBI one.
What's her name?
Beth.
I like it.
Ok, Rossi, out with it.
Is Hotch dating?
I don't know.
So, I was reading that you
shouldn't train the week before the race.
So...this might be it.
What are we gonna do about that?
Well, I think we should do something.
You know, race day's almost here.
You'll need a new excuse to see her.
It's been handled.
Attaboy.
I want you so bad.
What are you waiting for?
Still not feeling it?
Just keep trying. Just keep trying. Come on.
This isn't working.
Maybe you're just not in the mood.
Just give me 5 more minutes.
Come on. Really?
Look, I've done it before.
I can do it. It works.
Relax. I'm not saying you're broken.
It happens. Don't worry about it.
I already paid for the night.
Yeah, I know, but, honestly,
what's gonna happen now
that hasn't happened in the last couple of hours?
Come on. I just want to try one more thing.
Thanks.
One chai tea.
Now, correct me if I'm wrong,
but chai means tea.
So I just ordered you a--
a tea tea.
So, wait a minute. There's a chance you're gonna
be out on a case this weekend?
Probably a good chance.
What if you don't make it back in time?
I'll just have to do another race.
But you trained for this one.
I know. I'll just have to do the next one.
Maybe I'll do yours.
But you trained so hard.
I know. All for nothing.
Yeah, too bad nothing good came of it.
Um, well, assuming you do make it back,
I'd really like to be there, you know.
To see me collapse at the finish line.
I want that moment. I do.
I know Jack's gonna be there, so...
That's fine.
I'd love for you to meet him.
Great.
Oh, you're not playing around.
Mm. Will's away all week,
so I am pulling double duty with Henry.
Please tell me we are still on for saturday night,
because I have had it circled
on my calendar for the last 23.1/2 days,
which apparently, from the look of you, you did not.
Garcia paid good money for those salsa lessons.
I'll get a sitter.
Let's get started.
Ok. Atlanta field office has a serial on their hands.
Two prostitutes stabbed and staged in the last two weeks.
Atlanta's crime rate
has skyrocketed over the past few years.
Especially the proliferation of solicited sex
and drug use in the downtown district.
Maybe this guy thinks he's cleaning up the city.
It's rare for an unsub
who targets prostitutes to pose the bodies.
Means of disposal usually
reflects how the person feels towards them.
It looks like he didn't think poorly of his victims.
Even kept them dressed.
He could be filled with remorse.
The arms are folded, the bodies are laid to rest
in a quiet park outside the city. Maybe he knew them.
It could be personal.
There's a lot of rage in these kills.
Multiple stab wounds.
What about sexual violations?
No. The M.E.'s report says
there's no evidence of sexual activity before death.
So what's he doing with them?
That's what we need to find out.
Eckhart Tolle said,
"Where there is anger, there is always pain underneath."
Both of the victims had $250 on them
when they were found.
Why wouldn't the unsub take that?
It's a lot to pass up. Money must not be on his mind.
Dumping the bodies certainly is.
He chose two different parks outside of Atlanta.
The parks are 15 miles apart and 40 minutes from the city.
It speaks to his comfort zone.
Or he didn't want to return to the same location
and risk getting recognized.
Hey, guys, I hate to be the messenger of sad things,
but yet another body has been discovered
by some joggers at yet another park.
Her name's Rebecca Moore, and get this--
a missing persons report was filed on her.
Well, how long was she missing?
36 hours.
Who filed it?
Her friend Allyson Parker.
Prentiss, you and JJ find out from Allyson
if she has any insight on why Rebecca was targeted.
Morgan and Reid, go to the disposal site,
and dave and I will set up at the field office.
Where have you been?
Out.
Did you pick up the milk?
No.
He likes milk with his pancakes.
Sorry.
Sorry. It's not gonna make it magically appear, now, is it?
I made your favorites.
And I know you like a little oil in the pan
so the edges are crispy.
I considered making you scrambled eggs,
but with that whole recall and everything,
I figured pancakes are a safer bet.
How are they?
You need to eat.
Erika will be here any minute.
Oh, I'd like to have her for dinner.
How's tomorrow?
Sweetheart. Sweetheart!
You haven't taken your vitamins.
Those aren't vitamins.
Donald.
Hi. I'm agent Brooks.
Thanks for getting here so fast.
This guy's not taking a break.
Now 3 victims in two weeks?
I thought there was supposed to be a cooling-off period.
His recovery time is decreasing.
What's that about?
It's hard to say.
Well, I hope we catch him before there's another.
Is your M.E. Close?
I can get you a ride.
We're picking up Rebecca Moore's body now.
Why didn't you say anything at breakfast?
He won't listen to me.
So I have to be the bad guy
while you just watch, or are you gonna sit there
like a lump on a log with that stupid look on your face?
Linda, I don't want to do this right now.
Oh, you think I do? When I am trying
to give Jeffrey his pills, I need you to back me up.
Is that understood?
Look at me.
We both know what happens
when he goes off his medication.
So he parks in the road and
then carries the body, what?
Fifty two point six yards.
So he's gonna be in great shape.
You know, more often than not, prostitute are
murdered and dumped in the same area that they work.
So then why take the time to
drive extra 40 miles outside the city?
Maybe he's already up here. He picks them up downtown,
takes them to a secondary location,
kills them, and gets rid of the body as fast as possible.
Which means he lives nearby, in the suburbs.
With 76,728 other people.
Your mum's so sweet.
She invited me to dinner tomorrow.
Wanted to know if I was a vegetarian.
That's great.
Now just give me one more set.
How about I give you two more?
Oh, really?
Well, you want me to stop?
No, no, no. Keep going.
Now, this is one that I want you to keep up
for when your friends come over.
Just remember that the bigger the challenge,
the better the resistance.
Nobody really comes by anymore.
Really?
Yeah, I mean, they did at first,
but once they went away to school, nobody looked back.
You know, sometimes friends,
they don't know how to handle it.
They're afraid that they're gonna say the wrong thing.
Yeah.
Don't worry, though. I'm gonna keep you warmed up
for when they come around again.
All right, stop this. I want you to take a break.
Now, let's change things up.
Let's isolate your chest and then 5 more pounds.
This will increase your upper body strength,
which is gonna make it easier for you
when you're getting in and out of your chair.
You're gonna need a real challenge now
that you're getting stronger.
What do you mean?
Come on, you haven't noticed?
Maybe, a little.
Are you kidding? These past couple weeks
you've been like superman.
Spill it--what's your secret?
I don't--I don't know.
No? Ok, fine. You don't have to tell me.
Just keep it up. Whatever it is, you're doing great.
Ok, get back in there.
We're very sorry for your loss.
How long were you and Rebecca friends?
3 years.
You two had each other's backs.
It's why you filed the report?
It was almost two days.
I thought she was at the police station.
Getting locked up is better than
disappearing with one of them.
So what made you think something was wrong?
She always came back.
Bad as it was, this place was home, you know?
Did she have any regular customers?
We all do.
Rebecca had over $250 on her.
She did?
What would that kind of money get a customer?
A lot.
Like, all night or...
Nowadays, yeah.
What is it?
We need to find another girl.
We just did.
So do it again.
I can't go back there.
Why not?
It's too soon.
Find another way.
Is he really getting better?
I just heard Erika say that she's noticed
a big improvement in the last couple of weeks.
Don't you want him to be happy?
I'll take care of it.
Good.
Any sexual assault?
Third victim, still no signs of inflammation
or forcible penetration.
His inability to perform
sexually could be what triggers his rage.
Well, there's plenty of that.
Multiple stab wounds to the lungs.
She drowned in her own blood.
It takes a lot of force to inflict these types of wounds.
Oh, he's strong, no doubt.
The knife cut right through bone in some instances.
And what's this on her inner thigh?
That's a tramline bruise.
It's cause by something with a longitudinal
cylindrical surface.
Like a rod?
Yes. And I found the same type of bruising on the others.
Maybe some kind of restraint?
It's possible.
We need to take you back to the last time you saw Rebecca.
Where were you standing?
About here.
Facing which way?
Street.
A truck pulled up.
He was one of my regulars.
I was talking to him through the window
when Rebecca pulled up in a silver Beemer.
Did you recognize the car?
No. It must have been a new customer.
What did she do after that?
She looked back at me and started walking down the walk.
That's the last time I saw her.
Wait a second.
There was an older gray van.
I've seen it around here before.
It was parked there a long time.
A van? Where?
It parks right there.
Could you make out a license plate?
No, it was dark.
How long was it there?
A few hours, probably.
Why?
It's a loading zone. Permit parking only.
Go long, Bobby! Hut!
Excuse me.
Hi. I'm not sure I'm at the right address.
Mr. Collins?
Yes. Hi.
I'm sorry, can I help you?
My name is Julie. I'm here to see Jeffrey.
Oh. Yes.
Please, come in.
Were you going to use your insurance?
I'd like to pay out of pocket.
Most of my clients haven't filed, either.
It's still considered progressive treatment, I guess.
That's a lovely necklace.
Oh, thank you.
Jeffrey's room is down at the end of the hall.
Great. Thanks.
Reid, anything?
Now that we have 3 victims, there's a pattern.
It looks like his area of control is near Ridgecrest.
That's a bedroom community. Mostly white collar.
It give him easy access
to his hunting grounds and disposal sites.
Vehicle blends into both places.
Allyson remembered seeing a van parked on the street
the night that Rebecca disappeared.
And she'd seen it before. But get this--
It was parked in a loading zone for hours.
Well, let me check any recent tickets.
Our analyst already did that. Nothing.
It's not a residential area, so a vendor maybe.
Garcia's pulling permits now.
He's done this 3 times before.
Each victim is left with 250.
That's a $750 investment he didn't have to make.
He has every chance to take that money back,
but he buries it with them instead.
It could be an obsession or a manifestation of his guilt.
Everything that happened postmortem--
keeping them dressed, crossing their arms,
laying them to rest--
it's all very nurturing.
But the kills are the exact opposite,
incredibly violent and angry.
Multiple personalities?
Or multiple unsubs.
The violent one asserts his dominance
and the submissive one is left to clean up the mess.
Help me.
Help me.
Help me.
Help me. Help me.
Her name was Julie Harmon,
lived in a loft downtown,
250 cash in her bag,
wrapped in plastic.
That's new.
It's like she's prepped for a burial.
This woman doesn't fit victimology. Look at her nails.
The way she's dressed.
Her shoes haven't hit the pavement.
Maybe she's a high-class call girl.
Who fought back and got punished for it.
Blunt-force trauma,same bruise on the thighs...
This is the most violent
and shortest time between kills.
Feels like he is trying to break some kind of record.
This team has a complicated dynamic.
Ultimatly, they trust one another, but they still call independent.
Sounds like any disfunctional relationship.
How do we narrow that down?
Through her. The more we can learn about Julie,
the better we can understand why they are doing this.
Did you see what he did to her?
It wasn't any worse than the others.
It was as bad as the coed.
Ohh! Will you let that go!
We've given him everything he wants.
I can't keep doing this.
What do you want to do, stop?
She said he's getting stronger.
What if he can walk again?
You know what the chances are.
Well, he's always been exceptional.
I'm not giving up on him.
Scrub!
Use your scrub brush.
We're looking for a pair of white males
in their late 20s to early 30s,
who've developed a pattern of overkill followed by remorse.
This usually points to a dominant-submissive partnership.
The submissive follows the rules, knows the dominant's type,
obtains the victims and disposes of the body
once the dominant has completed his killing ritual.
What is the ritual?
It most likely involves some form of bondage.
All of the victims have identical bruises on their thighs,
but we're not sure if that's done during capture or kill.
There's no sexual assault, which tells us the dominant
is likely impotent or is experimenting
with other forms of sexual release.
We often refer to this as a thrill kill.
The dominant is inducing pain and creating terror
without a sexual element.
This provides him stimulation and excitement.
Like an adrenaline rush.
Exactly. The thrill of the murder is only a temporary fix.
Like any narcotic,
the violence satisfies his senses for a time,
but then it fades.
This is likely why his cooling-off period is nonexistent.
Despite a public investigation,
the unsubs have continued killing.
The risk of getting caught does not trump their need to kill.
We're moving on to the next round of "Go the limit."
All right, come on.
I just love this game.
All right. Are you ready to play our bonus round?
Ready as I can be.
Ok. Now, Mary Ellen...
I want another one.
We have to talk about this, son.
What is there to talk about?
Well, uh, how are you feeling?
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Your father's just trying to ask you.
We made a deal when you moved back in
that as long as you're under our roof, you will take your meds.
Well, they mess me up!
Look, if this is your way of trying to kick me out,
just come out and say it.
We're not trying to kick you out.
We'll ask the doctor about changing your prescription,
but for now you have to take your meds.
It's been a couple of weeks.
How dare you!
Just because she's been popping pills my entire life
doesn't mean I have to!
That is enough!
You're drunk, aren't you, dad?
That's ok. I don't blame you,
for being married to her.
I said that is enough!
Or what?
What are you gonna do that she hasn't already ruined?
We're doing the best we can.
You're not doing enough.
You really want to help me?
Then you'll put me out of my misery.
Ok, sugar lump. I got
all the information on the latest victim,
and it turns out you were half right.
Julie Harmon was a sexual surrogate.
They help people get their get-it-on on.
It's like having a hall pass with your therapist.
Does she have a list of patients?
Oh, I'm sure she does, but I can't find anything electronically.
She probably had a little black book.
You know, Luddite like.
All right. Thank you, mama.
Julie Harmon was a sexual surrogate.
Whoa! Sounds like somebody felt a little progressive prescription
might fix everything.
Well, they were wrong.
That's not just going
from high- to low-risk victims.
A sexual surrogate's a very specific type.
It's like they were trying to fix something.
Why else would you call a therapist?
They do treat patients with all types of disabilities,
whether it's developmental,
physical, or emotional.
Well, my guess is this guy had all 3.
Let's look at the physical.
He's got the upper-body strength to kill.
But the victims' bruises
tells us that he was using restraints.
Only they're not around the hands and feet,
where you'd typically restrain a victim.
They're tramline bruises around the thighs.
It's as if the victims are straddling a chair.
Physical infirmity, strong arms.
What if the unsub's in a wheelchair?
That would explain the van parked in the loading zone.
Handicap permits grant access all over the city.
I'll call Garcia.
We should talk to social workers, physical therapists,
anyone who deals directly with the disabled.
Given the anger and inability to perform,
those injuries are not recent.
His explosive outbursts could be built-up frustration,
which usually manifests when
things are out of one's control, like an accident.
Ok, so let's go with that.
I mean, whoever's helping
him has a definite loyalty.
Responsibility, even.
The caregiver could have caused the impairment.
He's the one who has shown remorse and guilt.
He might have a sense of morality.
If that's the case,
the best way to break up a partnership
is to drive a wedge between them.
And the key to doing that is to tell the caregiver he's forgiven.
Give him the strength to leave.
I'll tell agent Brooks to organize a press conference.
And we would like to appeal to this individual,
whom we believe functions as a caretaker, to come forward
and allow us to help.
You can stop this from happening to others
by doing the right thing
and contacting the Atlanta P.D.
We understand that you
feel a sense of loyalty towards your partner
And the need to comply with their demands,
but if you contact us,
we will do everything in our power
to help you both.
That was FBI Agent Jareau...
It's time.
I know.
How effective are those press conferences?
Incredibly.
Then why haven't we heard from him?
A bond like this takes years to develop.
We're not going to break it in a few hours.
I'm so glad you could make it.
I never turn down a home-cooked meal.
These are for you.
Oh, thank you. They're beautiful.
Everyone's waiting for you.
Everything about Julie Harmon's
murder was different.
It was the most violent and remorseful.
It's like the partners were each at their extremes.
All of the bodies were disposed of in a nurturing way,
but you're right.
Julie was wrapped in plastic.
It's neat.
It's almost too neat.
Maybe the caretaker is a woman.
By nature, women prefer cleaner disposal methods.
I don't know. I mean,
that terrain was something serious.
I mean, no offense, ladies, but reid and I hiked up that ridge
and there's no way a woman, physically fit or not,
could carry dead weight all that way.
And we profiled that the partner's in a wheelchair,
so that would make it impossible for him to help with disposal.
So there's a third person involved.
That rarely works.
It's always two against one.
They'd have to trust one another completely.
So what kind of relationship involves that dynamic?
They'd have to be incredibly good friends.
Or blackmailing one another.
Siblings.
What if it's parents protecting a child?
They raise them. They root for them.
They would share the same genes.
Apple don't fall far from the tree.
A parent would hold themselves accountable.
That explains the guilt.
But what kind of sick family pulls this off?
One that's probably done it before.
Oh, my god.
I know. It worked.
Can you believe it, mrs. Collins?
We think they have an only child.
It's unlikely a sibling
would participate in something this extreme.
If they felt responsible for his accident,
They might have rationalized
Doing anything to make him happy.
Well, we doubt murder is something they planned on.
It's more like a lethal side effect of their son's condition.
If there was orbital cortex damage from the accident,
It would help explain why killing is his release.
If the mother has psychopathic tendencies,
She could have passed it down through the x chromosome.
Garcia's looking up accidents now that have the parents at fault.
That list has to be long.
It is. So she's also looking for unsolved cases in the state.
There's a good chance this
isn't the first time the son's acted out.
The chicken's nice and tender.
I cooked it all the way through, because,
You know, salmonella is the silent killer
That nobody wants to talk about.
So, Erika, do you have a big family?
Um, I've got two older brothers.
You're the baby.
And the only girl.
Yep.
So was it loud in your house, all those boys
Clomping around?
I never knew any different.
When Jeffrey would come home after a game with his friends,
I swear they had bricks in their shoes.
They would shake the whole house.
And then Donald wanted to go for a girl.
Remember?
'cause he said, "Mama's boy. Mama's boy and daddy's girl."
But I said no, because I knew that I could never love
Another child as much as I love Jeffrey.
I just didn't have room in my heart for anyone else.
Oh, that's--that's sweet.
Have you got it?
Yeah.
Uh, Garcia, you're on speaker.
Ok, the only thing I can find that's remotely similar to this
Is from 5 years ago.
A coed at Georgia State was stabbed and left in a park.
Did she have bruises on her inner thigh?
Uh, M.E. Says...
Yes, she did.
All right, Garcia, check student enrollment for that year
For students with campus handicap permits.
I got a bushelful of matches. Let's narrow this down.
Look for in-state residents.
If the unsub was injured,
there's a good chance he stayed close to home.
They're all locals.
The parents would have covered it up
And they would have pulled their son out of school after the murder.
Here we go. Jeffrey Collins.
He dropped out of school weeks after the murder
And has since lived with his parents.
What's his story?
Sending it to you right now.
He's the only child of linda and donald collins,
who's local athtele who became paralyzed
When he was in a car accident when he was 15.
It says here the mother was driving,
but the injuries weren't consistent
With being behind the wheel.
But the father's were. Look.
Broken ribs, ruptured spleen,
Minor concussion.
He's obviously the one who hit the steering wheel.
Let me guess. The father was drunk.
Yeah. Twice the legal limit.
Sounds like they switched places and she covered for him.
But helping your husband avoid a DUI is far different
Than helping your son dispose of bodies.
Not necessarily. The mother fixes things.
She could have manipulated the husband
Into making up for his failure.
Garcia, you got an address?
Sending it to you now.
That was good.
Did you like it?
Yeah, I did.
Do you want to watch something else?
Actually, I'm feeling kind of tired.
Well, you've been squinting all night.
Do you have one of your headaches?
Yeah.
Did you take your meds today?
You can't stop taking those, you know.
Are they still in your room?
Yes, but my dad can get them.
That's ok. I can get them.
What is this?
Why is there blood under the bed?
You really shouldn't be in here.
There's blood. Why is there blood?
I'm his mother.
I would have gotten the pills.
We were on our way to the Collins home when we received the call.
Donald Collins was behind the wheel. Died on impact.
We found this in his coat pocket.
He confessed to all 4 murders.
Even in death he's still covering for his son.
No one else in the car?
No.
No skid marks. He probably hit the pole going about 65 mph.
He committed suicide.
It looks like he was trying to replicate the accident
That made Jeff a paraplegic.
This was his ultimate penance.
Is this their endgame?
If he was trying to replicate the accident,
Jeff and Linda would have both been in the car.
So where are they?
When someone invites you over,
You come in, you eat, you smile,
But then you leave.
The flowers were a really nice touch.
But obviously the rest of your manners are lacking.
What the hell are you doing?
I gotta get her out of here.
She has nothing to do with this.
Somebody help me.
She found out, and I'm not about to let her ruin everything.
I'm sorry. I know you really liked her,
but I'll find you someone else, ok?
Help me!
FBI!
Put the gun down.
Listen, mrs. Collins, we need you to put down your weapon.
Get the hell out of my house!
Get my dad. He'll tell you she's crazy.
Your father was killed in a car accident.
What?
Did he tell you what he did?
He killed all those girls, that sick son of a bitch.
Linda, this is over. Jeff is coming with us.
He's not going anywhere.
Your dad took his own life
Because he couldn't stand to be a part of this anymore.
He couldn't stand the guilt. He's a drunk.
Look what he did to my son!
Look what he did to my boy!
You did this. She's lying.
You need to let him take responsibility.
We know that Jeff hurt those girls.
You people. You think you're gonna come in here
And you're just gonna take my son
And you're gonna lock him up like some animal!
Linda, put it down.
Mom.
I always told you
That mommy would take care of everything.
It's ok.
"Live so that when your children think of fairness and integrity,
They think of you."
H. Jackson Brown Jr.
I know there's no handbook,
But what kind of parents do that for their kid?
Well, the Collinses obviously had issues before Jeffrey,
But the accident and his paralysis
Pushed it over the edge.
I guess so.
So, what time should I pick up Jack tomorrow?
I have to leave by 5 a.m.
Ok. Well, I tell you what.
You put on the coffee and I'll be there.
Thanks.
So you nervous?
I mean, it's not too late to back out.
I'm ready.
Maybe.
Still no sitter?
My sitter is not available.
Apparently I have a better chance of winning the lottery
Than getting a sitter on a saturday night.
What's going on tonight?
Oh, it was ladies night, but--
I forgot to book a sitter.
I'll do it.
Spence.
What? I've seen an episode of "Mr. Belvedere."
You've never babysat by yourself before.
You know--uh--
He could do a couple of hours.
What could possibly go wrong?
FBI铁人三项赛
A couple hours. A couple hours.
You guys didn't come home till sunrise.
Why are you yelling?
Make him stop.
Ok, hey, Jack, Jack.
Earmuffs for a minute. Earmuffs.
What did you guys drink last night?
The green fairy. You're in the FBI.
Could you get the entire crowd to stop cheering?
By my estimates, Hotch will be finishing any minute.
Do you see him, uncle Dave?
I think I do, kiddo.
Right there! There he is!
There he is! Come on!
Yeah! Come on!
Get in there!
Get in there! Atta boy!
Come on, Jack. Come on, Jack.
Let' go see your dad, Jack!
Go get him! Go, go, go!
Go! Go, go!
Thank you.
You did it!
I did, buddy, I did. Can you believe it?
Did you see my sign?
I did. That's for you, buddy.
Your sign's fantastic.
Look at you. How do you feel?
I think I'm gonna live.
That's pretty impressive. I had money on the swim killing you.
I practiced.
And it paid off. Good job.
Thank you.
Hey, you guys want something to eat?
Yeah, something greasy.
Oh, yeah.
Hotchner!
Beth! Jack, there's someone I want you to meet.
Come here.
You were amazing!
Congratulations!
Thanks.
Beth, I'd like you to meet my son Jack.
Jack, this is my friend Beth.
Hey there, Jack.
It's nice to meet you.
Do you work with my dad, too?
No. We're just friends.
Hey, don't tell me you made that.
Yep. I colored it myself and put the sparkles on, too.
You know what?
I look at art all day long,
And that, my friend, is pretty good.
Thank you.
Well, you're welcome.
We were gonna go get something to eat. You want to come?
Sure.
Ok. Great.
