we can never go back there .
so nice of your new man
to send us a pressed juice basket .

hey , puff puff pass .
ah , you don &apos;t smoke it .
no , it cleans your aura or some crap like that .
well , that sounds spiritual .
oh , you know , my healer says
the reason that i haven &apos;t been able to get pregnant
is that my aura is filthier
than my gynecologist &apos;s instagram .
but i did get a lot of likes .
ugh , sophie ,
i &apos;m getting second hand hippie .
sophie , i have got to get this out of here
or jennifer lawrence will think this is my vibe .
i &apos;m going for grace kelly not woody harrelson .
well , that &apos;s a mistake .
you know what ?
my healer , audra , gave me a whole list of things
that i need to do in order to get pregnant .
is one of them , &quot; have sex the front way &quot; ?
yeah , also , &quot; eat apples , meditate ,
cut down on cigars . &quot;

of your stupid pie hole .
oh , my god , i &apos;m a monster .
oh , my god , do you think that &apos;s jennifer lawrence ?
that was fast . what a star .
prompt and she costs less than a man .
or maybe it &apos;s randy . it &apos;s been a whole 38 minutes .
39 .
aww , that &apos;s making me horny .

i came over to tell you i can &apos;t stay the night tonight .

we &apos;re so close i can see the &quot; ho &quot; of the hollywood sign .
and i bet it &apos;s saying ,
&quot; i can see the ho of williamsburg . &quot;
wow , this place is gorgeous .
the last guy max dated had a mattress on the floor
and a lady named sheila living in the crawl space .
caroline , are you trying to make me jealous ?
oh , you have nothing to worry about .
there &apos;s no way that guy &apos;s still alive .
look , the next 24 hours ,
just treat this place like it &apos;s yours .
don &apos;t worry , i will take really good care of bruno .
i &apos;ll let him sleep right in the hills .
i haven &apos;t been this jealous of my dog
since i saw him licking his own balls every day .
randy , would you say it &apos;s private up here ?
like private enough to have a meeting with a celebrity
who i &apos;m not at will to name ,
but it &apos;s jennifer lawrence .
yeah , it &apos;s really quiet up here .
just one neighbor up the hill .
old guy . rocks the hell out of a stained sweat suit .

you know what ? just take my phone .
i &apos;ll buy a new one .
stop ... blowing .
stop blowing .
blowing ...
thank you !

compared to the ones in new york ?
this one was less work .
when jennifer lawrence gets here to interview me ,
just know , i &apos;m also kind of interviewing her .
i mean , i know she has my looks ,
but does she have my naivete ?
is that french for &quot; small boobs &quot; ?
max , i know i said this at the airport arby &apos;s ,
but i could totally see you living here .
thanks , girl .
i could totally see you visiting us .
and look at this tv from the future .
where are the cords ?
and watch this . television ...
give me samuel l. jackson .
finding samuel l. jackson .
wow , he &apos;s in every movie .
he &apos;s like the black kevin bacon .
dude , can you believe my life ?
and you saw that pool out there .
you don &apos;t even have to blow it up .
let &apos;s go look at it again .
excuse me , antonio ? could you water that cactus ?
it &apos;s looking a little dry .
that didn &apos;t sound rude to the help , did it ?
i don &apos;t want to be that person .
meaning you .
okay , jennifer lawrence will be here any minute ,
and , max , i have to say ,
i &apos;m having the best hair day ever .
i was having the best hair day ever .
dude , jennifer lawrence took a helicopter here .
that is so baller .
no , it &apos;s probably the paparazzi following her .
leave us be ! we &apos;re just trying to live !
this is the police !
there is a dangerous criminal in the area .
we are hunting for walter · gary · vance .
everyone , go inside .
this entire area is on lockdown .
no one will be allowed to pass the roadblock .
what &apos;re you doing ?
uh , there &apos;s a serial killer on the loose .
i &apos;m doing what all heroes do .
i &apos;m going on twitter to add to the chatter .
okay , i &apos;m running to my cactus to call j law &apos;s people
and make sure she doesn &apos;t come out here .
stop !
don &apos;t go out there .
according to twitter ,
the murder is a cannibal ,
and also according to twitter ,
khloe kardashian is feeling the burn .
oh , my god , a cannibal ?
we have to get inside .
i have this terrible feeling i &apos;m delicious .
so , here we are .
safe inside
in a house made of glass
on stilts
in a city long overdue for an earthquake .
we thought you were a crazy murderer .
i &apos;m not crazy , but i could just
murder a cheese plate right now .
the hills are so exclusive .
i mean , it &apos;s all blocked off .
i haven &apos;t jumped this many hurdles
since the &apos; 84 olympics .
sophie , what &apos;re you doing here ?
jennifer lawrence &apos;s people were trying to reach you ,
so they called the hotel ,
and to show you some love and kindness ,
i came all the way here to tell you .
yeah . do you think that will get me a baby ?
not sure , but you can get a baby for 80 bucks on the dark web .
and it comes with two outfits .
what did jennifer &apos;s people say ?
i don &apos;t know .
so , you just came up here to tell me that they called ,
but you didn &apos;t , like , listen to the words ?
oh , it &apos;s never enough for you , is it ?
ohm getting tired of meditating ,
but i think it &apos;s working .
jennifer lawrence is probably freaking out
that she can &apos;t get to me .
the world doesn &apos;t revolve around you , bitch .
i can &apos;t just stand here anymore .
i &apos;m going outside to get a signal .
you know what else you can get outside ?
ya face eaten .
well , i &apos;m gonna go risk the life i have
to go get the life i want .
sounds like a trailer for a liam neeson movie .
finding liam neeson .
good luck .
that guy &apos;s been taken more times than my virginities .
all right , i got a signal
and a warning growl from a coyote ,
but i talked to jennifer lawrence &apos;s people ,
and she and i are gonna facetime in 20 minutes .
if you still have a face .
where &apos;s bruno ?
maybe he &apos;s back there in the sauna
like a little hotdog .
where &apos;s my big boy ?
um , seriously , where &apos;s my big boy ?
you didn &apos;t leave the door open , did you ?
no .
i &apos;m sure he &apos;s in here somewhere .
bruno ? bruno ?
bruno ?
bruno ?
finding &quot; bruno . &quot;
max , i &apos;m really sorry .
maybe we could replace the dog
with one that looks exactly the same .
like men here do with wives .
or maybe we don &apos;t assume he &apos;s dead after six seconds
and we go out there and find him .
okay , good luck .
you are coming with me .
randy loves bruno ,
and i lo @-@ uh @-@ ike randy .
don &apos;t think i didn &apos;t hear what you almost said .
we need to find the dog .
but it &apos;s getting dark
and there &apos;s someone out there who wants to kill us .
trust me , there &apos;s someone in there who wants to kill you .
flashlights . we need flashlights .
you lo @-@ uh @-@ ike him .
now there are two people in here who want to kill you .
come here , big boy .
god , how could he have gotten this far on such little legs ?
i don &apos;t know , danny devito seems to get around a lot .
even when you tell randy this is 100 % your fault ,
he is still gonna break up with me .
max , you &apos;ve been with him four days .
i know , it &apos;s my longest relationship .
i &apos;m really sorry , max . we &apos;ll find him .
oh , my god !
what , you see bruno ?
no , i see bars on my phone .
we have to stay right here .
it &apos;s almost time for my facetime .
give me that stupid thing .
i &apos;ll put it down my pants .
and i &apos;ll go get it .
you gotta focus
and help me find that dog .
i don &apos;t want to ruin things with randy
or his house .
max , this is so far past boundaries .
oh , don &apos;t talk to me about boundaries .
who let the dog out ? who ?
who @-@ who @-@ who @-@ who ?
as i said to kevin burlington my sophomore year of college ,
&quot; just take it . &quot;
this is serious .
randy has given me so much .
sunglasses , gift baskets ,
an orgasm with eye contact .
oh , my god .
i know .
usually , i have to push their face away .
no , look .
we &apos;re at the foot of the hollywood sign .
quick selfie ?
i mean , we have to , right ?
on the way back , once we find the dog .
which we are definitely going to do .
jennifer lawrence is calling .
did you just hang up on j law ?
i &apos;m pretty sure that &apos;s against the j law .
you &apos;re out here because you lost randy &apos;s dog ,
and there &apos;s a strange man standing over there ,
and all you can think about is jennifer lawrence .
did you just say there &apos;s a strange man standing over there ?
oh , my god , i did .
look ...
see there , the old guy in the stained sweat suit .
oh , he must be randy &apos;s neighbor .
what &apos;s he doing out here ?
oh , you found bruno !
it &apos;s so funny , for a second
i thought he was the cannibal murderer .
oh , my god , he has a knife .
maybe he &apos;s just opening packages .
come here . come here , big boy .
uh ... run , max !
come here , big boy .
come on .
nothing to eat here .
i &apos;m stringy and chewy .
quick !
quick , up here !
maybe the helicopters will see us .
yeah , and if not ,
we can throw ourselves off the o.
i refuse to get eaten by an old man ...
without a bank account .
can cannibals climb ?
well , they &apos;re not called &quot; climbables , &quot; so that &apos;s good .
is he still there ?
well , we &apos;ll know in a second
&apos;cause you &apos;re screaming within earshot
of a hungry people @-@ eater .
you are surrounded ! put your hands up !
max , the police are here .
we &apos;re safe . we &apos;re safe .
speak for yourself .
i &apos;m technically under house arrest in connecticut .
i let him eat ice cream .
he deserves it .
who had a rough day yesterday ?
i am really sorry , randy .
you must think i &apos;m as irresponsible as i am .
this is where you cry
and tell him it &apos;s all you and i &apos;m perfect .
sorry , i was just thinking ,
that dog &apos;s gums and teeth look healthier than mine .
i still can &apos;t believe my neighbor
was walter gary vance the cannibal .
and honestly , it was way worse living next to courtney love .
i mean , it &apos;s not that hard .
blue bins are for recycling ,
tuesdays are street cleaning ,
don &apos;t do heroin on my porch .
yeah , that &apos;s a driveway sport .
look , bruno &apos;s gotten out before ,
but the fact that you went out there to look for him
and risked your lives .
i mean , you were fearless .
pfft , whatever . maybe a little .
ugh , great . jennifer lawrence just passed .
she &apos;s dead ?
no , she passed on the movie .
it &apos;s her loss .
well , it &apos;s your loss , but i feel like i owe you
for risking your life to find my boyfriend &apos;s dog .
not that you &apos;re my boyfriend ,
&apos;cause gross .
i &apos;d be lucky to be your boyfriend .
if i was , which yuck , i &apos;m not .
hey , everybody .
look , i &apos;m spiritually evolved now .
yeah , you know , the meditating was screwing up my knees ,
so i bought this getup from an indian woman at a bus stop .
yeah , it &apos;s a lot easier .
sophie , those flowers are beautiful .
yeah ...
and they &apos;re for you .
what &apos;re they gonna do to me ?
they &apos;re an act of love and kindness .
sophie , that &apos;s literally the nicest thing you &apos;ve ever said to me .
oh , yeah .
i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s my aura &apos;s clean ,
or it &apos;s the 12.95 bindi dot i &apos;m wearing ,
but i really do mean it .
oh , sophie , no . that &apos;s dog ice cream .
mind your own business , bitch !
and we &apos;re back .
