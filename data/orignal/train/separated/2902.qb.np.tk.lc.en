happy birthday !
happy birthday !
rach , come on .
it &apos;s your birthday !
hey ...
she &apos;s not as pretty as she was when she was 29 .
ms. green wants to establish some ground rules before she comes out .
she &apos;d appreciate it if you didn &apos;t use the words &quot; old &quot; or &quot; downill ... &quot;
... or &quot; they still look pretty damn good . &quot;
they do .
rachel , come on out .
monica made breakfast .
chocolate chip pancakes .
we &apos;ve got presents .
good ones ?
they all came from the list you handed out to us two weeks ago .
can i keep the presents and still be 29 ?
come on , rach , turning 30 is not that big a deal .
really ? is that how you felt when you turned 30 ?
why , god , why ?
we had a deal . let the others grow old , not me !
you know , i &apos;m still 29 in guam .
hey , 30 is not that old .
do you know how old the earth is ?
late 30s ?
you guys , is it just me ? am i overreacting ?
no , it &apos;s not just you . my 30th birthday sure wasn &apos;t much fun .
and now chandler !
we &apos;re all getting so old .
why are you doing this to us ?
the one where they all turn thirty
you &apos;re in a great place in your life . you have an amazing job , good friends .
your roommate &apos;s a soap opera star .
your character is in a coma .
i promised myself i wasn &apos;t gonna cry at this one .
i know my life &apos;s going pretty well , but i see so many people ...
... who &apos;ve accomplished their goals before they &apos;re 30 .
yeah , but you shouldn &apos;t compare yourself to me .
come on , phoebe !
you can do it !
come on .
there you go .
i did it ! one mile on a hippity hop .
that &apos;s everything i wanted to do before i was 30 .
except i wanted to patch things up with my sister .
oh , well . but , yeah !
girls , this thing is a godsend , if you know what i mean .
thirty . oh , i mean , 30 .
monica , you remember mean , old mrs. kreiger in fifth grade ? she was 30 .
let &apos;s have some fun . what do you want to do ?
nothing . i don &apos;t want to do anything .
doing nothing on your 30th is better than doing something stupid , like ross .
that was a practical purchase .
i needed that car for transportation .
okay ? i have a child .
how hot do i look in this ?
ross , a sports car ?
wouldrt it be cheaper to just stuff a sock down there ?
that &apos;s not what this is about .
i am a sports car enthusiast .
i &apos;ve always been into cars .
what &apos;s the horsepower ?
i don &apos;t know , but look how shiny !
i can &apos;t believe you bought this .
really . god , ross , what were you thinking ?
i know it &apos;s really shallow , but part of me wants him again .
well , get in line , missy .
so can i have a ride , stud ?
hop in .
get ready for the smoothest ride of your life .
damn it .
okay , who &apos;s next ?
i am gonna do something today . i &apos;m not just gonna sit around like some old lady .
i want to get something pierced .
like my nose or my tongue or something .
really ? because that hurts .
so what ? the way i see it ...
son of a bitch !
look , i know what you &apos;re going through .
i &apos;m totally freaked out about turning 25 .
get out of my apartment .
rach , i think that you &apos;re doing great .
let &apos;s face it , no one handles this well .
least of all you .
why , what did you do ?
weren &apos;t you asked to leave , sonny ?
put that back on . monica will be here any minute .
but it hurts my joey &apos;s apple .
for the last time , it &apos;s not named after each individual man .
you &apos;ve done a wonderful job with this party , chandler . everything &apos;s so lovely .
well , not as lovely as you .
i can &apos;t believe you have a 30 @-@ year @-@ old daughter .
and i can &apos;t believe you have a tux that &apos;s 30 years old .
it &apos;s older than that . ross was actually conceived right near this tuxedo .
everybody hide ! i saw her . she &apos;s coming .
everybody down !
crap .
everybody stay here . i &apos;ll find out what &apos;s going on .
hey , you got the door open !
hey , are you drunk ?
no .
okay .
okay .
see , i was a little nervous about turning ...
... 30 .
so the busboys took me out for some drinks .
might want to puke on you later .
here &apos;s the thing . we &apos;ve thrown a very formal surprise party for you .
your friends are in there , and your parents .
no !
yes ! yes !
no .
oh , no ! my parents have never seen me drunk .
that they know of .
we &apos;ll get you some coffee . they &apos;ll never know that you &apos;re drunk .
you promise ?
i &apos;ll take care of it .
i love you so much .
okay , we have to do something about your breath .
what about your breath ?
that &apos;s still yours .
now remember , it &apos;s a surprise party .
so when you go in , act surprised .
ready ?
surprise !
okay , forward . forward .
stop !
okay , back ... stop !
okay , for ... stop !
stop ! stop !
ross , just forget about it . the guy &apos;s got you totally wedged in .
is this yours ?
no , it &apos;s mine ! it &apos;s mine .
dude , you so need this car .
okay , here &apos;s what we &apos;re gonna do .
i &apos;ll break into this minivan , put it in neutral .
you push it forward so ross can drive out of the spot .
all right . here we go .
haul ass !
happy 30th birthday ! here .
it &apos;s for the child in you . and the woman .
happy 30th !
right . why do you keep saying that ?
because it &apos;s our 30th birthday .
yeah , no , we &apos;re not 30 . we &apos;re 31 . okay .
wait .
oh , it &apos;s you .
yeah . what ?
yeah , we &apos;re not 30 . we &apos;re 31 .
that &apos;s what it says on my birth certificate .
you have a birth certificate ?
i got a big box of family stuff when my mom died .
our mom .
right . okay .
do you have mine ?
no , i sold it to a swedish runaway .
oh , my god .
oh , my god , we are 31 !
yeah .
i just lost a whole year of my life .
okay .
your middle name is pamela ?
yes .
i never knew mine . do you remember what it is ?
yes . phoebe .
that &apos;s my first name .
right . okay . then , no .
we made it across the room . you &apos;re doing great .
what &apos;s going on ?
monica &apos;s a little drunk .
yeah ! i love drunk monica .
oh , she &apos;s so much more fun than regular monica .
she doesn &apos;t want her parents to know .
all right , all right . here &apos;s what we &apos;ll do .
i &apos;ll get twice as drunk , then no one will even notice her .
drunk phoebe &apos;s mean .
okay , you watch your tone with me !
what &apos;s going on ?
monica &apos;s wasted .
maybe that will liven up this party .
will you just help her get changed ?
taking care of a drunk , naked woman seems like a job for joey .
this one &apos;s from me .
it wasn &apos;t on your list , but it &apos;s really fun .
a scooter .
stick to the list .
always stick to the list .
no , no , i love it . thank you .
open ours next ! open ours next !
now that you &apos;re a couple , we don &apos;t get two gifts ?
for my last birthday , you gave me a hug .
read the card ! read the card !
&quot; happy birthday , grandma .
it &apos;s better to be over the hill ...
... than buried under it .
all our love , monica and chandler . &quot; that &apos;s funny .
no , no . that was a joke .
i know , i get it . it &apos;s funny .
because you &apos;re not a grandma .
to be a grandma , you have to be married and have children .
i don &apos;t have any of those things . that &apos;s why it &apos;s so funny .
i &apos;m just gonna go ...
all you had to do was buy the card .
hey , look who &apos;s back . it &apos;s the birthday girl .
how &apos;s the birthday girl feeling ?
well , i feel fine , but i think you &apos;re bumming out the rest of the kids .
it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids .
all i really needed was a plan .
see , i want three kids .
and you want to have them all at the same time and have them for your brother .
as i was saying ...
i should have the first one by the time i &apos;m 35 .
which gives me five years .
i love this plan . i &apos;m gonna marry this plan .
if you could do that , i &apos;d marry the hippity hop .
if i want a kid when i &apos;m 35 , i don &apos;t have to get pregnant until i &apos;m 34 .
which gives prada four years to start making maternity clothes .
but i want to be married for a year before i get pregnant .
really ? that long ?
look all you want , it &apos;s happening .
i don &apos;t have to get married until i &apos;m 33 . that &apos;s three whole years .
wait a minute , though .
i &apos;ll need a year and a half to plan the wedding .
and i &apos;d like to know the guy for a year , year and a half ...
... before we get engaged .
which means i need to meet the guy by the time i &apos;m 30 .
which is fine because you just turned ...
.. 28 !
no , ross . no , it is not fine .
i should already be with the guy i &apos;m gonna marry .
will you quit hogging it ?
i &apos;m telling you , it &apos;s like watching bambi learn how to walk .
you &apos;re drunk .
mom and dad are gonna be mad .
maybe i &apos;m a little drunk .
are those crab cakes ?
did i not tell you to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready ?
how you feeling ?
you are so handsome .
i want to make love to you right here , right now .
i really wish that you wouldn &apos;t .
just get through a little bit more , then we can put you in bed .
just smile and don &apos;t talk to anyone .
speech , speech ! let &apos;s hear from the birthday girl .
pheebs !
see , everybody &apos;s looking at me .
the plan &apos;s working .
i didn &apos;t even have to take off my top yet .
speech . come on , speech !
you can &apos;t keep your hands off her for one second .
i think it &apos;s nice .
i think it &apos;s necessary .
i want to thank you all for coming .
my family and ...
... my friends .
i &apos;d really like to say that i &apos;m ...
you know what i &apos;d really like to say ?
i &apos;m drunk !
that &apos;s right , mom and dad .
your little harmonica is hammered .
and guess what ?
i &apos;ve been drunk before .
and i &apos;ve smoked a cigarette .
and i &apos;ve had a box of ding dongs hidden in my underwear drawer .
it &apos;s all okay . it &apos;s okay because ...
... i turned 30 today .
and i can do anything i want .
because i am a grownup .
okay , quick . help me get this off .
i lost a whole year .
i can &apos;t believe it . this is so unfair !
come on , pheebs , it &apos;ll be okay .
will it ? will it ?
how would you feel if you found out you were 31 ?
that &apos;s not gonna happen . because we have a new deal .
plus , it ruined my schedule .
i haven &apos;t done any of the things i wanted to do by the time i was 31 .
like what ?
like i haven &apos;t met any portuguese people .
i haven &apos;t had the perfect kiss .
and i haven &apos;t been to sniper school .
why don &apos;t we go and have some birthday cake .
i just feel like being by myself for a while . see you guys later . thanks .
poor pheebs .
hey , you know what , you guys ? i think i &apos;m gonna walk her home .
oh , man .
what ?
he &apos;s gonna eat the cake .
pheebs !
listen , i ...
close your eyes .
that &apos;s one thing you can cross off your list .
oh , yeah .
plus , i &apos;m one @-@ sixteenth portuguese .
okay , is everybody clear ?
we &apos;re gonna pick it up ...
... and move it .
all we need is teamwork . we &apos;re gonna lift the car ...
... and slide it out .
lift ...
... and slide .
ross , i really don &apos;t think this ...
lift ...
... and slide .
all right . come on , dogs , let &apos;s lift this sucker .
oh , unless you &apos;re scared . little weaklings scared ?
good teamwork .
okay , here we go .
all right , everyone .
lift ...
... and slide .
hey , joey ...
come on , rach , my turn just started .
actually , i just want to talk to tag .
oh , okay . hey , can i ride this outside ?
whatever . i &apos;m not your mother .
not in the street !
are you feeling any better ?
yeah , i &apos;m doing okay . i &apos;m ...
let &apos;s talk .
what &apos;s up ?
oh , tag ...
you &apos;re such a great guy . and we have so much fun together .
but i ...
wait .
i think i see where you &apos;re going .
but before you say anything else , can i say one more thing ?
well said .
and a good example of the fun i was referring to .
but i think i &apos;m past the point where i can just have fun .
rachel , don &apos;t do this . this is just because you &apos;re turning 30 .
yeah , it is .
but you &apos;re just a kid . i mean , you &apos;re 25 .
twenty @-@ four , actually .
oh , god .
you know what i wish ? i wish you were six years older .
well , if i &apos;m wishing for stuff , i actually wish i was six years younger .
me too .
yeah . sorry .
hey , how &apos;d it go ?
if i only want two kids , can i keep him for another year ?
you did the right thing .
i don &apos;t like this anymore .
well , here we are . just a bunch of 30 @-@ year @-@ olds .
do you realize in 10 years we &apos;re gonna be 40 ?
why , god ?
why are you doing this to us ?
yes ! my baby &apos;s finally free .
all right !
