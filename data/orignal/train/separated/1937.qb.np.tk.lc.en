&quot; the great pretender &quot;
are you sure you should do that here ?
we &apos;re awfully close to the road .
what are you so worried about ?
what we &apos;re doing is illegal !
just don &apos;t like doing things that are illegal .
so we just -- just dump them on the ground ?
no , you -- you know , we ... scatter them .
around the campsite .
this is our spot .
okay , pops . it &apos;s show time .
everybody has something to hide .
we can &apos;t just expose all our secrets to the world .
it &apos;s on top shelf ! in the fridge .
hello -- i &apos;m in here . - oh , i know . i &apos;m sorry .
our shower is still busted and i got rounds .
you know what ? i told him a thousand times ...
... you put the bread on the counter , it molds .
you put it in the fridge , it &apos;s fine .
i &apos;m right , right ?
okay .
hey , do you know where the bread is ?
you need to get your shower fixed !
that &apos;s how we get hurt .
it &apos;s how we risk hurting other people .
we have to decide how much we let out ...
... and keep the truth to ourselves .
hey . how &apos;d it go with the kids ?
uh , great . uh , they &apos;re amazing .
i just dropped them off at daycare .
thanks again for watching them .
yeah . how about you ?
how was your weekend ... in d.c ...
with your husband ?
it ... was fun .
i &apos;m a little exhausted , you know .
but it was the good kind of exhausted , right ?
did you even leave the bedroom ?
was he surprised ? did he freak ?
yeah , did he ... freak ?
or did you just go straight
to getting frea @-@ kay ?
you know , did we even push the button , because it &apos;s just ...
hey , look who &apos;s back .
meredith was just about to tell us
about her weekend with derek .
good . tell me now so you don &apos;t show up in my bed tonight .
it &apos;s a good thing you didn &apos;t walk in on this morning .
everyone &apos;s getting freaky but me .
well , actually , i was just --
actually remembered i @-@ i have to , uh -- yeah .
they totally got freaky .
and i come in this morning ,
and herman &apos;s rearranged the entire o.r. board
with new fetal surgeries .
i used to be so good at one @-@ night stands .
i ... i missed a beat .
no , i was great at them .
and now , whenever i &apos;m not watching sofia ,
i just sit alone at home in my pajamas .
i @-@ i want to be out of my pajamas and not alone .
so go .
meet someone . it &apos;s easy .
oh , it &apos;s easy .
well , what do you do ? what &apos;s your line ?
i don &apos;t use lines . i &apos;m just honest .
what do you mean &quot; honest &quot; ?
i don &apos;t know .
they start with &quot; what do you do ? &quot;
and i tell them i &apos;m a trauma surgeon ,
and they wonder why i chose that .
and i tell them i served in the war ,
and i fixed soldiers on the battlefield ,
and that was a ...
really satisfying way to save lives .
and it still is .
yeah , that &apos;ll do it .
you &apos;ve got game , major hunt .
it &apos;s not a game . it &apos;s just --
wha-- what happened to the couch ?
sorry i &apos;m late . i &apos;m sorry i &apos;m late .
three surgeries today , robbins .
they &apos;re not gonna round on themselves .
i know . i &apos;m on it .
yeah , um , wilson just barged in and stole my shower .
edwards , does she always walk around naked ?
not around the hospital , generally .
it &apos;s like &quot; residents gone wild . &quot;
robbins , do you live with residents ?
oh , god . is that thing still on ?
you &apos;re a grown @-@ up . get your own place .
i need you focused here .
lie down , nicole .
so , d @-@ did wilson just climb in the shower with you ?
yeah . no . we-- instead of me .
was she coming on to you ?
no !
doubtful .
you know what ? can we --
just -- let &apos;s drop it .
&quot; residents gone wild . &quot;
would you go ?
you &apos;re making her laugh too much .
i thought you were going back to the airport .
i just couldn &apos;t get on that plane .
thank you .
thank you for letting me stay the weekend ,
being there for me .
it was just what i needed .
i hate the circumstances , but , uh ,
i &apos;m glad it gave us a chance to reconnect .
i hear that jackson and april are coming in today .
have you seen him ?
catherine , he asked you to keep your distance .
and i &apos;m honoring that request .
look , i know how hard that is for you , okay ?
but you sent food , you call for updates .
they know you &apos;re there .
i know . i just hate it .
i &apos;ll miss you .
well , i &apos;ll -- i &apos;ll be in the o.r. anyway .
i have an open colectomy today .
i could scrub in , do your ureteral stents .
that &apos;ll give us a little more time .
i could make that happen .
make it happen .
so , you and meredith are getting pretty tight , huh ?
what do you mean ?
well , what did she say about this weekend ?
why ? did she tell you something ?
you said she told you .
no , i said she was about to tell me .
what do you think she was about to tell you ?
what did she tell you ?
wasn &apos;t there a couch there ?
what -- um , don &apos;t you want to say something ?
this is the closest thing to a funeral .
no , dad hated funerals .
&quot; sprinkle me in the woods . &quot;
god , he was a pain in the ass .
well , you can &apos;t just say that .
you know , one of his favorite memories
was taking us out here camping .
&quot; we eat what we catch . &quot;
&quot; we sleep in what we can carry . &quot;
just us men .
you okay ?
maybe we should just go .
hey , race you to the top .
wai--
come on . what you got ? what you got ?
oh , goodness .
it &apos;s so muggy .
it &apos;s hard to breathe .
you okay ?
hey , curt . you should sit down .
curt ! curt ! wha-- curt !
call 911 !
hey . how was your weekend ?
it was nice .
she got some .
she doesn &apos;t want to talk about it .
oh , well , i &apos;m glad you went . i got some , too .
definitely don &apos;t want to talk about that .
what do we got ?
curtis warren , post syncope .
31 . he &apos;s still tachycardic , diaphoretic ,
and hypotensive after fainting .
but don &apos;t just stand here , grey . give me a hand .
over here !
hillary list , 27 @-@ year @-@ old female ,
found unconscious at the scene after a pretty bad tumble
down a flight of concrete stairs in the park .
hill , honey , i &apos;m right here .
oh , it &apos;s all my fault .
this was your fault ?
no . no , no , no , no , no .
i didn &apos;t push her . i proposed to her .
okay , let &apos;s go to trauma two .
fast scan is negative .
because there &apos;s nothing wrong with me .
any changes in your diet recently ?
i told them i missed breakfast ,
so i was a little woozy in the woods .
he &apos;s still mildly hypotensive after two liters .
i &apos;m fine .
well , there &apos;s definitely some tenderness there .
well , run his liver enzymes and get a coag panel .
let &apos;s get you into this . you know what ?
i &apos;m gonna re @-@ check that abdom--
no !
look , i don &apos;t need to put on this stupid thing .
would you calm down ?
look , benji , get off me !
w @-@ would you tell them to back off ?
okay , okay . okay .
family shouldn &apos;t be in here anyway .
let &apos;s step outside .
you can change , and i will be back for you .
he &apos;s usually a sweetheart . i &apos;ll go talk to him .
well , bailey , he &apos;s my patient .
i &apos;ll take it . you can go .
i took her to the park .
it was , um -- it was where we had our first date ,
so i thought that had a certain symmetry .
i &apos;ll order a head c.t.
and an x @-@ ray for her right wrist and right knee .
at the top of the stairs , i got down on my knee
and i said ...
&quot; hillary , when i met you , &quot;
&quot; i felt like my life blossomed with fullness . &quot;
&quot; like the sun had shone down on me , baby . &quot;
and that &apos;s as far as i got .
i had more , but she fainted and she fell all the way down .
i ... should &apos;ve caught her .
hill ? hill ? hill ? honey ? honey .
hey , hey , hey . it &apos;s me .
right here . hey , i &apos;m here .
i &apos;m never leaving your side .
i &apos;ll never ... ever leave you .
i &apos;ll never ...
oh , she &apos;s out again .
hill ? hill ? hillary ?
todd , uh , we &apos;re gonna admit her now .
yeah .
so , uh , dr. wilson &apos;s gonna show you
where you can wait , okay ?
and page neuro .
i &apos;m here .
todd .
i &apos;ll just ... i &apos;m just gonna be over here , baby .
dr. herman , you scheduled another surgery for tomorrow ?
i thought we said --
yes , uh , the larsen mom . sorry .
is this the attendings &apos; lounge couch ?
it was .
dr. herman , please stop making me be this guy .
you can &apos;t just steal
hospital furniture .
i need this couch .
this is the best couch in the building .
it &apos;s firm , but soft .
bouncy .
responsive .
would you like to try it out ?
well , um ... i @-@ i think that &apos;s , um --
i @-@ i @-@ i appreciate the , um , offer , but i --
uh , hunt . i &apos;m messing with you .
larsen &apos;s gonna be a quick in and out .
9 : 30 , o.r. six .
is that fine with you ?
that &apos;s fine , yeah .
and , um ...
was that a &quot; no &quot; on trying out the couch ?
hey . so , i &apos;m good to go ?
curt , your liver enzymes , they &apos;re off the charts .
any idea why that might be ?
i got to reminiscing about dad last night .
maybe one too many whisky toasts .
okay , i &apos;m gonna get a c.t.
oh , come on .
listen . what are you getting at ?
i ran some extra tests ,
because what i was seeing wasn &apos;t making any sense .
your lab results for a 30 @-@ year @-@ old man are not normal ,
and you had the estrogen levels of a young woman .
i just want to know what you &apos;re dealing with so i can help you .
hillary , scans show that the fall
caused an artery under your skull to bleed .
you &apos;ll need surgery to repair it .
and then dr. wilson and i will repair the fracture in your knee .
but none of this explains why you passed out .
has this ever happened before ?
fainting , dizzy spells ?
no , never .
uh , todd said that it happened a couple of times .
you were talking on the couch and then you --
i just nodded off .
well , i &apos;d like to run a complete neuro work @-@ up to find out --
is that really necessary ?
i know it &apos;s scary ,
but multiple fainting spells can mean a lot of things --
heart problems -- - it &apos;s not that .
i &apos;m also concerned about narcolepsy , cataplexy --
no , no ! there &apos;s no plexies .
i didn &apos;t faint .
not on the couch , not on the stairs .
okay , well , todd said that --
i faked it .
i faked fainting when he proposed
because i didn &apos;t know how to say no
without breaking his tender , little , quivering heart .
we should scrub in together more often .
i could come to you on occasion .
i &apos;m thinking he will need a component separation .
i &apos;ll call in a plastics consult .
no , he &apos;s fine . there &apos;s hardly any --
page dr . avery , please .
uh @-@ huh . you got it .
if there &apos;s good news and bad news ,
i want the good news first .
okay .
the good news is , a person can live without a spleen .
i &apos;m removing yours today .
the c.t. showed your spleen is remarkably swollen .
it &apos;s probably due to a clot in the splenic vein --
are you on drugs ?
coke or something ?
benji , come on .
&apos;cause i &apos;m looking at this organ damage
and i don &apos;t know what to think .
do you have any idea what it could be , dr. grey ?
okay .
curt .
don &apos;t be stupid .
all right , if you &apos;re in trouble ,
you can tell me , whatever it is .
you know that .
ben .
you know me .
i don &apos;t do drugs .
i never have .
can you make that call ?
he wouldn &apos;t lie to me .
drugs are off the table .
but it &apos;s something ,
so try thinking like a doctor , not his --
i am thinking like a doctor .
maybe there &apos;s a genetic component .
my father just died of colon cancer .
maybe we start there .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s his colon .
you got a better idea ?
all right , then we start running tests .
look , i just lost my dad , miranda .
i &apos;m not gonna lose my brother , too .
just --
okay , is this what i think it is ?
what do you think it is ?
i &apos;m not blind , grey .
my husband might be , but i &apos;m not .
now , he has no hair on his chest or arms .
he waxes his eyebrows .
i &apos;d kill to have eyebrows like that .
and then i &apos;m looking at these numbers and the splenic damage ,
is he doing what i think he &apos;s doing ?
you have to ask curt .
that zola , she could play go fish all night long .
you have a budding card shark on your hands .
yeah , well , we eventually hide the cards .
it &apos;s the only way she &apos;ll stop .
i &apos;ll have to remember that for next time .
look , i just want to say that , um ...
i am not here to judge you , but i &apos;m a bad liar .
so ...
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
you packed a suitcase full of lingerie
and you went away for the weekend .
yeah , i -- - and then derek called me three times
asking where you were .
meanwhile , you texted me
telling me what a great time you were having ,
so whatever you were doing , whoever --
he , she , they , whatever --
it wasn &apos;t with him , and that &apos;s all .
i want to be here for you ,
but i like derek and i hate lying .
oh g-- grey ! pierce ! get in here !
okay , okay . it &apos;s okay .
call the o.r. let them know we &apos;re coming now !
oh , god , curt !
robbins . let &apos;s go scrub .
coming .
listen , just talk to her , and -- and maybe buy her a robe .
why would i do that ?
was this about the naked resident ?
ooh , you and wilson , you &apos;re a thing .
you know what ? let &apos;s not .
and robbins can get handsy with the residents .
really ?
i do not !
last year , she got handsy .
h.r. got involved . there are policies now .
because of you ?
robbins , that &apos;s incredible .
it &apos;s not . it -- both of you stop , okay ?
alex , it &apos;s inappropriate .
she &apos;s a resident . i &apos;m her superior .
i &apos;m a girl who likes girls .
it just puts us both in a very awkward position ,
and you should respect that .
well , i &apos;m kind of down for whatever happens .
i &apos;m gonna kill you .
hey .
hey .
you need to start putting on pants around the house
&apos;cause robbins keeps checking out your ass .
no . no . alex , no .
you don &apos;t need to put pants on , okay ?
your ass is -- it -- fine .
see ? that &apos;s reportable .
no ! i ...
i hate you all .
i have surgery .
this is the best day .
oh , god , i &apos;m awful .
there is nothing wrong with todd .
he &apos;s -- he &apos;s nice and he &apos;s stable
and he cares for me deeply ... so deeply .
and he &apos;s clingy , and he loves to --
i don &apos;t even know what to call it ,
but he likes to ... pet me .
it &apos;s really soft , and it
he &apos;s boring .
so , i just started doing this thing
where i pretend to faint so he &apos;ll stop talking .
wow , that is ...
diabolical .
why don &apos;t you just tell him the truth ?
because it would kill him .
i mean , he wants to take things to the next level ,
but the more that he feels , the less i do .
and then today , we were in the park ,
and he got down on one knee
and he looked up at me with his big wet eyes ,
so i just -- - faked it .
i didn &apos;t realize how close i was to the steps .
but i had to go with it all the way down .
you can really commit .
yeah .
but not to todd .
shepherd , how &apos;s herman ?
any changes to the tumor ?
oh , it &apos;s grown a little inferiorly .
uh , but it &apos;s still within the margins i expected .
why ?
i was just checking .
actually , um ...
her behavior is --
she &apos;s stealing furniture .
and ... she was flirting with me .
herman flirted with you ?
i think so .
i ... yeah .
did you take her up on it ?
i mean , she &apos;s very attractive .
no . uh , yes , she -- she is , bu--
and tall .
i mean , she might be the tallest person in the hospital .
you might find tall people attractive .
i don &apos;t know .
no , i don &apos;t .
not as a rule ,
but professionally , it &apos;s not a good idea .
is that a rule ?
no co @-@ workers ?
didn &apos;t say that .
i @-@ i like co @-@ workers .
i @-@ i -- but the -- the hospital , we have rules
that are , um ...
thank you for the update .
you wanted a consult ?
not me .
me .
mom .
i asked you to go .
i need you to take a look at this incision , sweetheart .
she &apos;s not just trying to check on me and april ?
don &apos;t look at me . i got played , too .
they just took him in .
how the hell did this happen ?
he was sitting up and talking to me an hour ago .
well , we knew about the spleen .
it made his stomach muscles bleed ,
but pierce will clip them and grey --
you were right . you were right about the drugs .
i @-@ i didn &apos;t want to believe it at first , but it &apos;s obvious .
he -- he &apos;s using .
okay , now , we shouldn &apos;t jump --
i &apos;ll get him in rehab .
as soon as he can walk out of here , i &apos;m go--
ben , wait .
what do you think it is ? coke ? crystal ?
come on , y @-@ you &apos;re usually right about these things .
tell me .
i think ...
you should talk to curt .
is there -- there something you &apos;re not telling me ?
after surgery , he &apos;ll tell you everything .
tell me what ? miranda .
just talk to him . he &apos;ll --
but what if i don &apos;t get the chance to ?
what -- what if he doesn &apos;t come out of surgery ?
oh , that &apos;s nonsense . now , just calm down .
calm down ?
i &apos;m being lied to by my brother ,
and now i &apos;m being lied to by my wife .
i &apos;m not lying to you .
well , no one &apos;s telling me the damn truth !
i &apos;ll tell you !
it &apos;s only because when he tells you ,
you need to react better than this , ben warren .
what is it ?
okay , curt is ...
curt is transitioning .
he ...
she is transgender .
and she identifies as female ,
and she wants to live life as a woman .
your brother is becoming your sister .
oh , my god .
oh -- oh , that son of a bitch .
he -- he put you up to this .
bleeding is controlled .
clamping the hilum . suture ligature .
so , what did you say when he called ?
the first time , i said that you were in the shower .
ligating the gastric vessels .
the second time , i said you were taking a nap .
and the third time ,
i said hunt called you in for an emergent rectal abscess .
i hate lying .
i didn &apos;t want to spoil anything .
i need to dissect the splenorenal ligament .
metz .
hey , okay .
pierce just controlled the gastric bleeds with clips ,
and now grey is finishing taking out the spleen .
all right , now , um -- he &apos;s upset about dad .
he &apos;s obviously having some sort of emotional breakdown ,
so we &apos;ll get him a psych consult .
no , we won &apos;t .
curt &apos;s crazy . this makes no sense .
all right , the only thing that does make sense right now
is that after the surgery , you will talk to curt ...
and you will listen to curt tell you her good news ,
and it is good news .
and you will listen ,
and you will tell her that you love her
and tell her that you &apos;ll always be here for her .
okay , so after the fetoscope is inserted ,
then i will deploy the shunt ,
and you &apos;ll manipulate the camera , right ?
you &apos;re a hypocrite .
i beg your pardon ?
you , uh , were so high and mighty when i was boffing graham .
which one was it ? which resident did you sully ?
oh , god . i knew that you would ...
you can &apos;t suddenly become interesting and then clam up .
it -- it was a year ago , and she &apos;s gone now .
weren &apos;t you married last year ?
yes .
no . well , we -- we were broken up .
i thought you just split .
this was a different ti--
i cheated on callie , okay ?
oh , my god .
how have you been hiding this from me ?
hiding what ?
the dirt . you &apos;re dirty .
and here i thought you were no fun at all .
oh , stop it . i &apos;m --
you &apos;re a dirty , dirty girl .
you &apos;re dirty .
minimal swelling . i like that .
hey , can i get an e.t.a on when you &apos;re closing
just so i can prep the leg ?
one last vessel here .
so , she threw herself down a flight of stairs
just to avoid telling him yes or no ?
mm @-@ hmm .
have you met the boyfriend ?
wilson , go let him know that her brain surgery was successful .
bring tissues .
oh . poor guy .
poor guy ?
i &apos;m sewing her brain shut right now .
oh , todd &apos;s the problem here ?
why ? &apos; cause he cares too much ?
he feels too much ?
he &apos;s -- he &apos;s willing to devote himself fully
to another person . that &apos;s the problem ?
if it makes the other person want to pass out , yeah .
well , then that &apos;s it .
that &apos;s why i can &apos;t pick people up anymore ,
because i don &apos;t know how to put them back down .
that &apos;s why i have no game .
i used to have game .
i had such game .
yeah ?
i used to be fun and cool and sexy and go to bars
and do this thing where you make eye contact once
and look away .
just reel them in without a word .
such game .
hey , what was your secret ?
drugs .
i was on drugs .
so , i &apos;m leaving out
the terrible , terrible repercussions ,
but ever since i got off the drugs , i &apos;ve gotten worse .
now i &apos;m just all mumbling and vomiting words
and no cool , no sexy , no game at all .
same here . game over .
i want to be clear -- i am in no way
endorsing narcotics as a dating aid .
understood .
so , dinner &apos;s coming ?
yes , mom .
you still haven &apos;t told me . how &apos;s april ?
mom , she &apos;s all right .
and i &apos;m fine .
we &apos;re doing okay .
i don &apos;t believe that for one second .
mom , what do you want me to say ?
mom , she &apos;s sad , obviously .
april is angry , okay ?
about the baby , about god .
she just needs her space .
and i can &apos;t help her .
i just make her crazy ,
which just makes me feel useless .
she doesn &apos;t need space so much as the illusion of space .
you should do what i do .
stay out of her way , but not too far .
find something else to occupy your mind .
work is good .
now , be close , but just out of sight .
and you &apos;ll be there for her when she &apos;s ready .
okay , i &apos;m pretty sure what you just described is stalking .
your abdominal closure should be fine .
is that what this weekend was for you ?
something else to occupy your mind ?
i &apos;m not cheating on my husband .
then where were you ?
it &apos;s really not that big a deal .
then why are you being so weird about it ?
you have to tell me something .
i have to ?
i lied for you .
i &apos;m sorry if i put you in a position
where you felt like you had to lie for me ,
but that doesn &apos;t make this any of your business .
okay , maybe not .
i just
i thought we were finally getting somewhere .
you trusted me with your kids .
i trust my babysitter with my kids .
that doesn &apos;t mean i owe her my life story .
pierce , i &apos;m sorry .
no . no , it &apos;s fine . it &apos;s fine .
that came out wrong .
you &apos;re right .
just do me a favor .
next time , call your babysitter .
leave me out of it .
oh , there she is . are you all right ?
how is she ? is she all well again ?
she &apos;s gonna be fine . both surgeries went very well .
thank you . thank --
thank you .
hill . i &apos;m gonna take you home .
i &apos;m gonna make sure that you have
everything you need , all right ?
you tell him right now .
todd .
you have been so sweet ,
and you have been so kind ,
and i have been unfair to you .
no , no .
no , don &apos;t worry about me .
i love you . i &apos;m right here .
and i &apos;m never leaving you .
ever .
oh , hillary . hillary ?
hillary ? !
she fainted !
help her !
for god sake .
she can &apos;t take another fall like that .
todd , what hillary &apos;s trying to tell you
is that she wants to break up with you .
what ?
i &apos;m so sorry .
i know that all you want is to help her ,
but she doesn &apos;t want that .
she doesn &apos;t deserve it . she &apos;s faking this right now .
what ?
todd .
you deserve someone who wants you there , you know ?
um , someone who needs the kind of attention
that only you can give ,
and it &apos;s not gonna be hillary , okay , and it shouldn &apos;t be .
and you will be fine ... without her ,
and it may take a while to find the right person ,
but you will find her .
you should start looking , okay ?
she &apos;s right .
don &apos;t waste another minute . start right now .
there .
thank you .
just -- just tell me , where &apos;s this all coming from ?
it &apos;s coming from me . this is who i am .
since when ?
i mean , what , you just suddenly decided --
benji , i &apos;ve known since i was 5 .
5 ?
because , you know , i wanted to play for the bears when i was 5
because you don &apos;t know crap when you &apos;re 5 .
i knew this .
yeah , but why didn &apos;t i know it ?
we shared a room for 18 years .
you ever have that dream where you &apos;re pushed out on stage
and everybody knows their lines except you ?
and you &apos;re in some costume
or you &apos;re naked or -- or whatever .
and you &apos;re just trapped there .
you can &apos;t ...
that was my whole life .
every day of my life , pretending .
benji , i &apos;m tired of pretending .
i just want to be happy with who i am .
can you understand that ?
so , now you give a damn about what i think ?
now suddenly it matters that i understand ?
you know it does .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m just supposed to be okay with this ?
i @-@ i &apos;m just supposed to accept this ?
wa--wai--
okay , i &apos;ll go talk to him .
don &apos;t bother .
how soon do you think i can get out of here ?
i don &apos;t imagine you need a ride to the airport .
i have a car .
what are you doing ?
you scrub in with me , you take over the o.r.
so you can call your son on a phony consult ?
i needed to know how he was doing .
i &apos;m talking about us .
what about us , richard ?
it looks like you got what you wanted
and you &apos;re running out the door .
you used me .
i seem to recall your saying i use people all the time --
cristina yang , the harper avery .
so , why are you so surprised now ?
i was angry when i said those things .
and i was angry when i heard them .
i thought after the last few days , i ...
i thought we &apos;d moved on from that .
richard , you were here for me in a terrible time .
i appreciate that , but i &apos;m still me ,
and you &apos;re not okay with who i am .
one minute , you find a powerful woman attractive ,
the next minute , your feelings are hurt .
you can &apos;t have it both ways .
you &apos;re gonna have to figure that out
before we move on anywhere .
i went to the airport , i got through security ,
i went up to the gate ,
they called my boarding group , and i just stood there .
i froze . i didn &apos;t get on the plane .
i watched the plane take off from behind the glass ...
... i got in my car , and i left .
oh , meredith .
i didn &apos;t know how to tell anyone ...
... that i didn &apos;t get on the plane to visit my husband .
so , i drove to one of those hotels by the airport .
and you stayed there by yourself all weekend ?
you were embarrassed , so you hid .
i ... i kind of get that .
well , it &apos;s -- - no , no , it &apos;s okay .
you don &apos;t have to say another word .
that must &apos;ve been awful .
those cheap hotel rooms are horrible .
you must felt terrible and lonely and embarrassed ...
... and i just made it worse by bugging you ...
asking you questions when i should &apos;ve just ...
i totally understand why you didn &apos;t tell me .
i wouldn &apos;t have told anybody , either .
i &apos;m so sorry , i &apos;m so sorry .
but thank you ... for telling me .
thank you for understanding .
benjamin warren , i &apos;m so disappointed in you .
she &apos;s your family .
i get it , okay ?
you &apos;re so evolved ,
so tolerant and quick to adjust .
and i &apos;m just a -- a dumb caveman .
well , you don &apos;t have to be .
25 years miranda .
i counted them up today .
that &apos;s how long we either shared a bedroom
or an apartment or a damn tent in the woods .
it &apos;s a long time for this not to come up , don &apos;t you think ?
she wasn &apos;t ready .
if this was anyone else , there wouldn &apos;t even be an issue ...
... but i told him everything .
from my first crush --
kahlia hogg , fourth grade --
the night i proposed to the gorgeous miranda bailey .
and everything in between .
i had to tell curt .
first thing , always .
but now he -- he &apos;s got the biggest thing in his life ...
... and he waited 25 years to tell me .
how &apos;s that supposed to make me feel ?
well , this isn &apos;t about you , ben .
it &apos;s her song .
so get off the stage , let her sing it .
no , could you please stop with that ?
i feel like it was all a lie ,
you know ?
our whole life ...
he lied to me .
well , curt needs your help now .
well , it &apos;s -- it &apos;s a little late to ask .
should &apos;ve asked 25 years ago .
mnh @-@ mnh . i &apos;m -- i &apos;m done with him .
her .
curt .
um , this is dr. avery .
he &apos;s a plastic surgeon .
um , you might want to hear him out .
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s your call .
you have a name yet ?
guessing you &apos;re not sticking with curtis .
rosalind .
that &apos;s a beautiful name .
so , can i call you rosalind then ?
&apos;cause i don &apos;t know what we &apos;re waiting for .
hey , i &apos;m jackson .
now , let &apos;s go over some ground rules .
first , those off @-@ shelf hormone treatments you &apos;re taking --
no . those are over .
from now on , everything that goes in your body
is approved and regulated by this hospital .
understood ?
absolutely .
okay .
you see a therapist ?
not for a while .
okay . well , it &apos;s time to start again .
so , we &apos;ll get started with a full medical history .
you know , i used to be fun .
i used to skate around the halls of this hospital .
why don &apos;t you ?
my bad .
i used to go dancing .
i used to ...
... flirt and be flirted with .
now i live in a house full of naked people
and all of my friends are her friends ,
and all i have is work and i never want to go home .
i had a busy , busy life .
i sat on all these boards --
pacific ballet , seattle opera .
whatever was very important to my ex .
used to be so worried about what he thought of me ,
what my peers thought , what everybody thought .
but now i do what i want , when i want ,
and it &apos;s sweet .
i have to tell you , robbins ,
my life is so much better now that i have nothing .
i mean , i can &apos;t recommend a tumor ,
but you should try it .
you should go home .
i am home .
why do you think i stole this couch ?
we can &apos;t waste a minute .
i &apos;m gonna stay here until , uh ...
until it &apos;s over .
whatever that means .
then i &apos;ll stay with you tonight .
you should know ...
i &apos;m not gonna have sex with you .
sh @-@ shut up !
y--
sorry .
do you drink wine ?
i just wanted to visit ,
and people bring wine sometimes when they &apos;re ...
... going to visit another person .
especially if they have --
they bring a bottle .
that &apos;s -- that &apos;s water .
so ...
because i don &apos;t drink wine .
i -- i don &apos;t drink at all .
not anymore .
so , i brought water , and ...
i &apos;m sorry .
i have literally no game .
i should go . it &apos;s sparkling .
lime .
just wanted to say hi .
hey , do you want some water ?
not thirsty .
okay , wait .
amelia .
stop walking .
i &apos;m gonna kiss you now , so don &apos;t -- don &apos;t say anything .
it &apos;s scary to reveal everything about ourselves .
and now you can go home .
i &apos;m just -- um -- now i &apos;m gonna -- i &apos;m gonna go home .
which is ... that way .
fear makes us hold ourselves back .
is that so wrong ?
okay , this is taking too long .
dance with me .
okay .
okay .
maybe . probably .
but still ...
... it helps to be a little sneaky ,
a little protective .
it &apos;s not safe to just blurt out all of our secrets .
never got on the plane . i never went to d.c.
now you want to blab .
where &apos;s pierce ?
what is she -- morning shift ? i get nights ?
i went to a hotel .
what ? with who ? do i know him ?
no . by myself .
you didn &apos;t want to see derek ?
i did . too much .
what if i got off the plane and he wasn &apos;t happy to see me ?
what if he didn &apos;t smile ?
that would be bad .
that would mean it &apos;s done , it &apos;s over .
so what ? you just head out alone ?
i mean , why didn &apos;t you just come back ?
i was going to .
and then ... i didn &apos;t .
and it was amazing .
it was just me for three days .
all by myself .
i wasn &apos;t anybody &apos;s wife or doctor or mother .
and i kind of liked it .
if i had gone to d.c. , we would &apos;ve fought
or we would &apos;ve talked about fighting ,
and i don &apos;t want to talk anymore .
i don &apos;t want to fight anymore .
alex .
i don &apos;t want to leave him .
but i definitely do not want to be with him right now .
we can &apos;t just lay all the truth out there ...
... expose ourselves to god and everybody .
hey , have you seen my -- oh !
oh . a little warning ...
... when people are over would be nice .
i told her to wear pants .
i don &apos;t have to wear pants .
it &apos;s perfectly fine if i don &apos;t wear pants .
doesn &apos;t make me stupid .
&apos;cause once the truth is out ...
i &apos;m gonna marry that girl .
... we have to face it ourselves .
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s gonna happen with us .
