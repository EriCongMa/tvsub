gerald tate &apos;s here .
he wants to know what &apos;s happening to his deal .
go get harvey .
i check .
raise .
5,000 .
i &apos;m all @-@ in .
you can pay me later . i got to go .
gentlemen .
i &apos;m paying you millions ,
and you &apos;re telling me i &apos;m gonna get screwed ?
jessica , have i come at a bad time ?
gerald , this is harvey specter .
he &apos;s our best closer .
well , if you &apos;re the best closer ,
where the hell you been for the last three hours ?
well , gerald , i specialize in troubled situations ,
and when i left here at 7 : 00 p.m. ,
this deal wasn &apos;t in jeopardy ,
so i &apos;m just trying to figure out what happened in the interim .
we keep offering more money .
they keep rejecting it .
it &apos;s last @-@ minute bad faith bullshit .
says here that cooper won &apos;t be staying on
as honorary vice president .
that &apos;s right . i don &apos;t want him around .
he wouldn &apos;t be around .
it &apos;s an honorary position .
i don &apos;t give a shit .
well , i think you do ,
because that &apos;s what &apos;s changed since i left ,
which means it &apos;s you who &apos;s been dealing in bad faith .
well , now that you &apos;ve got a grasp on what &apos;s happened
in the goddamn interim ,
what are you gonna do about it ?
because he &apos;s not getting that title .
well , let me make sure i understand this , okay ?
we negotiated a deal that gave you everything you wanted .
mr. cooper signed it ,
and now you won &apos;t close
until we take away the last shred of his dignity ?
bingo .
well , that &apos;s not gonna happen .
and why the hell not ?
because i like mr. cooper ,
and my firm doesn &apos;t operate in bad faith .
oh . i see how it is .
instead of working cooper ,
you &apos;re working me .
well , why don &apos;t you take your pansy attitude
back in there and make him sign my deal ?
or i &apos;ll pay someone else your money to do it for me .
first of all , gerald ,
if you think anyone &apos;s gonna touch this deal
after your bad faith , you &apos;re mistaken .
second , the way our agreement works is ,
the minute cooper signed the deal
which gave you everything you wanted ,
our fee was due and payable ,
which is why at 7 : 30
i received confirmation of a wire transfer
from escrow indicating payment in full .
so i &apos;d say the ball &apos;s in your court ,
but the truth is your balls are in my fist .
now i apologize if that image is too pansy for you ,
but i &apos;m comfortable enough with my manhood
to put it out there .
now get your ass in there
and close the goddamn deal .
you gonna let him talk to me like this ?
harvey speaks for the firm .
we got paid before gerald signed the deal ?
what are you talking about ?
this is a memo about some fire drill on tuesday .
you &apos;re the blue team captain .
you get to wear a fire hat .
time &apos;s up .
pencils down .
excuse me . do i know you from somewhere ?
i don &apos;t think so .
i have a pretty good memory for faces .
so do i.
sorry .
i got it .
stop ! you in the cap !
what did you get me ?
what i said i was gonna get you .
a 158 .
i told you i wanted a 175 .
and i told you only 1 out of 100 people
can score that .
you &apos;re a b @-@ minus student .
you got 1,000 on your sats .
if i get you a 175,
they &apos;ll know you cheated .
so only a genius loser can get a 175 ?
actually , no . i would get a 180 .
now can i have my money , please ?
whoa . this is only half .
then why don &apos;t you go call the police ?
i got to get my shit together .
that &apos;s the best cheeseburger i &apos;ve had in my life .
it &apos;s from monday , trevor .
look , man , i &apos;m serious .
i almost got caught today .
i &apos;ve got to stop getting stoned .
i &apos;ve got to get my act together .
dude , look at me .
you can burn bud and still be a success .
you sell pot for a living .
still saps the motivation .
all i &apos;m saying is , you want in ,
you are in .
you know , that is word for word
your offer before i got caught
cheating on your math test in the third grade .
goddamn memory .
stop .
look , no one &apos;s gonna suspect you &apos;re a dealer .
i mean , look at me .
this is a $ 2,000 suit , mike .
i got , like , 12 of &apos; em .
i take on real software projects .
i have clients who bring me briefcases filled with cash ,
and i hand them identical briefcases with vacuum @-@ sealed bud .
so what do you need me for ?
well , i have a client coming in from out of town ,
and i can &apos;t meet him ,
and i need someone i can trust to make the drop .
it &apos;s totally safe .
trevor , a person is more likely
to die while dealing drugs than they would be on death row in texas .
wait . what are you talking about ?
it &apos;s from freakonomics .
通过对各种数据的巧妙分析得出了种种令人跌破眼镜的结论
do you read anything that i give you ?
it doesn &apos;t matter ,
because you have to find somebody else .
i &apos;m not interested .
not interested in what ?
what are you doing here ?
you said you were gonna stay at your place tonight .
hi , sweetie .
what a pleasant surprise .
i &apos;m so glad you stopped by .
we &apos;re in the middle of something .
what are you in the middle of ?
trevor &apos;s trying to set me up .
that &apos;s terrific .
who &apos;s the lucky girl ?
i &apos;m trying to get him to work for me .
that &apos;s a great idea .
it will take some stress off trevor ,
and you &apos;ll pick up writing code
like you do everything else .
all right . i got to go .
i got go get up early to see my grandmother
and pay them another month .
good night .
bye .
how did you know gerald wouldn &apos;t look at that memo ?
because a charging bull always looks at the red cape ,
not at the man with the sword .
by the way , i &apos;ve set up a meeting
for you and john dockery next week .
dockery ? he &apos;s skadden &apos;s biggest client .
not anymore .
he &apos;s looking around .
he plays tennis . i want you to close him .
consider it done .
then you are officially dismissed
for the evening .
cheers .
well , you two seem to be celebrating something .
mm @-@ hmm . we are .
in fact , you are looking
at the best closer this city has ever seen .
closer , huh ?
baseball ?
attorney .
i close situations .
hmm . so you only care about money ?
the truth is , i do it for the children .
i &apos;m lisa .
harvey .
lisa , i don &apos;t normally do this ,
but since we are celebrating ,
what time do you get off tonight ?
i &apos;m glad you asked .
i get off at ten past
&quot; i &apos;m never going out with you . &quot;
i guess you &apos;re not the best closer this city &apos;s ever seen .
morning .
lisa , this was lovely ,
but i &apos;m afraid you have to go .
i hate to miss a workout ,
and i really need to be in the office by 7 : 30 .
i can make you breakfast .
you could eat it off my stomach .
i guess if i skip the gym ,
i can still get in by 9 : 00 .
i hear someone &apos;s not taking their pills .
because they &apos;re trying to poison me .
grammy , that &apos;s crazy .
dr. shrager gave me her word
she wouldn &apos;t poison you until january .
if she does it before then , she can &apos;t count it towards next year &apos;s quota .
oh , what did i teach you ?
michael , i &apos;m not gonna be around forever .
and i want you to stop with that stuff .
what stuff ?
i may be old ,
but i &apos;m not an idiot .
i know life has been hard for you ,
but you &apos;re not a kid anymore ,
and i want you to promise
you &apos;re gonna start living up to your potential .
i promise .
i &apos;m not saying that i haven &apos;t been charmed by harvey ,
but it &apos;s just so patronizing
when you say that he can handle those things
and , &quot; louis , you can only handle this . &quot;
jessica , i could have handled gerald tate .
and i told you i disagree .
why ?
because when you put two bullies
in the same room together ,
things generally don &apos;t go so well .
it &apos;s 9 : 30 . nice of you to show up
two hours after we open for business .
and i see that you &apos;re also trying to look like a pimp .
my bad , louis . i was out late last night .
and when i woke up , this is the suit your wife picked out for me .
and that would be funny if i &apos;d actually been married .
moving along .
you &apos;re not married ?
recruiting . harvey .
your interviews are set up for tomorrow .
what ? why don &apos;t we just hire
the harvard summer associate douche ?
i think if you listen to the phrasing of that question ,
you &apos;ll come up with an answer .
we need people who think on their feet ,
not another clone with a rod up his ass .
harvey , the fact that we only hire from harvard
gives us a cache that &apos;s a little more valuable
than hiring a kid from rutgers .
you went to harvard law .
i &apos;m an exception .
find me another one .
can we please skip the recruiting ?
i work better alone anyway .
well , i would , harvey ,
except all senior partners get an associate .
it &apos;s just a rule .
i &apos;m sorry . what ?
jessica , i deserve that promotion .
my billables destroy his .
and i &apos;m here night and day doing whatever &apos;s needed
instead of swanning in and out of here
whenever i please .
i must admit , he does make me sound very swan @-@ like .
harvey ,
shut up .
louis , this is how it is .
all right , now you two make nice .
louis , i apologize . i was out of line .
now if you &apos;ll just let me text your pretend wife
that i just made senior partner , i--what ?
your grandmother &apos;s getting worse .
i need to move her to full care
or i &apos;ll have to transfer her to the state facility .
i won &apos;t put her in a state facility .
then i &apos;m afraid you &apos;ll have to come up with 25,000 .
trevor , i &apos;m in .
one @-@ time deal . i want 25 .
take it or leave it .
i &apos;ll take it .
there &apos;s a briefcase in my room .
pick it up tomorrow ,
take it to room 2412 at the chilton hotel .
now you can &apos;t go to a luxury hotel
looking like a delivery guy ,
so shave , comb your hair , buy a suit .
that &apos;s a hell of a lot to ask , man .
well , i &apos;m not asking you . i &apos;m paying you $ 25,000 .
okay ?
yeah , he &apos;s in .
good .
i think i &apos;m gonna take a piss .
key .
24 hours , we &apos;ll know if this new buyer &apos;s a cop .
why didn &apos;t you tell trevor
he might be sending his guy into a setup ?
same reason why i don &apos;t tell gina i &apos;m banging her sister .
it &apos;ll only cause trouble .
what &apos;s up ?
i &apos;m just gonna take off .
i don &apos;t think you should .
why don &apos;t you stay with us till tomorrow ?
now give me your cell phone .
give me your phone .
don &apos;t even think about warning your boy .
&apos;cause if these guys are cops ,
whoever &apos;s holding that weed is going to jail for a long time .
geez , you scared the hell out of me .
sorry .
look at you .
you look great .
thanks .
tell me you decided to work with trevor .
yeah . trial basis . yeah .
good .
what are you doing here ?
my mom is coming by my place later .
and i don &apos;t want to mess it up ,
so i &apos;m hanging here .
got to go .
come here .
you want to look perfect on your first day .
yeah .
i &apos;ve got to go .
great . thanks .
donna , we &apos;re gonna need to streamline this .
give each guy a hard time .
before you send them back ,
give me a wink if they say something clever .
cool ?
okay .
what are you looking for ?
another me .
so , chip ,
what makes you think that i &apos;m gonna let
the whitest man that i have ever seen interview for our firm ?
because i have an appointment .
thanks .
you can do this .
kid , what is wrong with you ?
you look like you &apos;re 11 years old .
i was late to puberty .
harvey specter .
uh , excuse me .
i was thinking about going for a swim .
are the pool facilities here nice ?
of course , sir .
this is the chilton hotel .
why &apos;s the pool closed ?
and do you have the time ?
yes , it &apos;s uh ...
10 o &apos;clock .
thanks .
he saw your gun .
you think that &apos;s him ?
matches the description .
but he didn &apos;t go in the room .
it &apos;s 10 : 00 exactly . he &apos;s just walking by ?
go after him . stay on the radio .
rick sorkin .
rick sorkin .
rick sorkin ?
excuse me , mr. sorkin ,
you are five minutes late .
is there a reason why i should let you in ?
look , i &apos;m just trying to ditch the cops , okay ?
i don &apos;t really care if you let me in or not .
mr. specter will be right with you .
what ?
can i get you anything ? a coffee or a bottle of water ?
hi , rick sorkin .
harvey specter . nice to meet you .
why don &apos;t you have a seat here ?
whoa . what &apos;s this ?
can i help you ?
no .
how the hell did you know they were the police ?
i read this novel in elementary school ,
and it was the exact same thing .
you read a novel in elementary school .
what ? i like to read .
and why &apos;d you ask them what time it was ?
throw &apos; em off .
what kind of drug dealer asks a cop what time it is
when he &apos;s got a briefcase full of pot , right ?
we should hire you .
jesus , i &apos;d give you the 25 grand
as a signing bonus .
i &apos;ll take it .
unfortunately ,
we only hire from harvard .
and you not only did not go to harvard law school ,
you haven &apos;t even gone to any law school .
what if i told you that i consume knowledge
like no one you &apos;ve ever met ,
and i &apos;ve actually passed the bar ?
i &apos;d say you &apos;re full of crap .
that &apos;s a barbri legal handbook right there , right ?
open it up . read me something .
anything .
&quot; civil liability associated with agency is based
on several factors-- &quot;
&quot; including the deviation of the agent from his path ,
&quot; the reasonable inference of agency on behalf of the plaintiff ,
and the nature of the damages themselves . &quot;
how did you know that ?
i learned it when i studied for the bar .
okay , hotshot ,
fire up this laptop .
i &apos;m gonna show you
what a harvard attorney can do .
pick a topic .
stock option backdating .
although backdating options is legal ,
violations arise related to disclosures
under irc section 409a .
you forgot about sarbanes @-@ oxley .
the statute of limitations
renders sarbanes @-@ oxley moot post 2007 .
not if you can find actions
to cover up the violation
as established in the sixth circuit , may 2008 .
that &apos;s impressive , but you &apos;re sitting at a computer .
playing hearts .
sorry . if you want to beat me ,
you &apos;re gonna have to do it at something else .
how can you know all that ?
i told you . i like to read .
and once i read something , i understand it .
and once i understand it , i never forget it .
why take the bar ?
this dickhead bet me i couldn &apos;t pass it
without going to law school .
okay , look ,
this is all pretty fascinating stuff ,
but i &apos;m afraid i got to get back to work .
i &apos;ll make sure that serpico isn &apos;t around
waiting for you .
you want this job so much ,
why didn &apos;t you just go to law school ?
when i was in college ,
it was my dream to be a lawyer .
i needed some money ,
and trevor convinced me
to memorize this math test
and to sell it .
turns out we sold it to the dean &apos;s daughter .
i lost my scholarship , i got kicked out of school , i ...
i got knocked into a different life .
and i have been wishing for a way back ever since .
let me tell you something .
this isn &apos;t elementary school . this is hard work .
long hours . high pressure .
i need a grown goddamn man .
you give me this ,
and i will work as hard as it takes
to school those harvard douches
and become the best lawyer you have ever seen .
i &apos;m inclined to give you a shot ,
but what if i decide to go another way ?
i &apos;d say that &apos;s fair .
sometimes i like to hang out with people
who aren &apos;t that bright , you know ,
just to see how the other half lives .
move over .
i &apos;m emailing the firm i just found our next associate .
all right . you &apos;re gonna start a week from monday .
here &apos;s what you &apos;re gonna do .
first , no more pot . we drug test .
stop smoking now , you &apos;ll be fine ,
i assume that &apos;s all the drugs you do .
how do you know that ?
you read books , i read people .
and potheads smoke pot . that &apos;s what they do .
it &apos;s not all i do . i have interests .
you &apos;re albert frigging &apos; einstein ,
and you couldn &apos;t manage to get into law school ?
you think that &apos;s not from smoking weed ?
trevor got--
that &apos;s another thing .
you &apos;re never gonna talk to trevor again .
you &apos;re gonna ditch that briefcase ,
and you &apos;re gonna get on a plane to harvard ,
and you &apos;re gonna learn everything there is
about going to law school there .
did you buy that suit ?
yeah .
let &apos;s buy some new ones .
hi .
how do i sign up for today &apos;s law school tour ?
you go back in time six weeks
because that &apos;s when it booked up .
this is harvard law .
we get over 7,000 applications a year .
you think you can just walk in and take a tour ?
thank you .
eduardo fernandez , who , first of all ,
looks like he works at the public pool or something ,
and he comes up to me the other day ,
and i completely know he &apos;s a freshman .
and he looks at me and he goes ,
&quot; where &apos;s the public health school ? &quot;
which is right around the corner ,
and you know what i tell him ?
clifford watkins ?
excuse me .
can i help you ?
jonathan atwater .
i work for dean wormer in the admissions office .
yes , of course . what can i do for you ?
well , the dean personally sent me down here
to invite you to a small cocktail hour
for some of our more realistic candidates .
and we &apos;d like to keep this sort of thing discreet ,
so if you &apos;d subtly hand me your name tag ,
you can proceed directly to the dean &apos;s office .
congratulations .
harvard law is the oldest law school in the country
and boasts the most successful graduates in the world .
currently , we are six of nine supreme court justices
and , of course , the president of the united states .
uh , hi , good morning .
i &apos;m here to see--
have a seat .
thank you .
mike ross ?
hi , i &apos;m rachel zane .
i &apos;ll be giving you your orientation .
wow . you &apos;re pretty .
good . you &apos;ve hit on me .
we can get it out of the way that i am not interested .
no , i &apos;m sorry . i wasn &apos;t hitting on you .
trust me .
i &apos;ve given dozens of these ,
and without fail , whatever new hotshot it is
thinks that , because i &apos;m just a paralegal ,
that i will somehow be blown away by his dazzling degree .
let me assure you , i won &apos;t .
i was . i was hitting on you .
you were . take notes .
i &apos;m not gonna repeat myself .
i love you .
the firm operates on a chain of command model .
harvey &apos;s your commanding officer .
however , louis litt , he oversees all associates ,
so you &apos;ll also answer to him .
what do you think about harvey ?
people are in awe of him .
they say he &apos;s the best closer there is ,
but i have very little contact with him ,
so i don &apos;t know .
and what about louis litt ?
let &apos;s continue with your tour .
hey , becky . you are glowing .
i wonder why that is . oh , yeah .
it &apos;s the day they announce my promotion .
jimmy , have you lost weight ?
steve @-@ o.
looking like a guy who came to work .
excuse me , why are you scratching off
the senior off my door ?
i got a work order to take it off .
who issued the work order ?
my supervisor .
why did he issue the work order ?
if i knew that , i &apos;d be his supervisor .
you seem to be enjoying yourself .
i haven &apos;t enjoyed myself since 2004 .
donna !
someone &apos;s trying to have a little fun with me here .
jessica wants to see you in her office .
now .
and finally , this is where you &apos;ll live .
i gave you that for a reason . you haven &apos;t taken one note .
that &apos;s because--
because you were too busy ogling me
to listen to a word i &apos;ve said ?
partners &apos; offices anchor the wings .
fifth floor &apos;s research , sixth is security .
all work gets billed ,
even if it &apos;s finding an address .
i answer to harvey and louis litt , and , judging by the way
you responded to my questions ,
i should admire harvey and i should fear louis .
you have been here for five years ,
and just because i outrank you
does not mean i have the authority to command your services .
oh , it &apos;s also pretty clear
that you think you &apos;re too smart to be a paralegal .
you know what nobody likes ?
nobody likes a showoff .
you used the word &quot; ogling . &quot;
when do i get to see harvey ?
gerald tate fired the firm .
so you &apos;re taking my promotion away .
you know , most firms would put you in front of the bar
and have your license stripped .
you lied to a client , and he figured it out .
i lied to him to get him to do the right thing
and honor his goddamn contract .
and you didn &apos;t seem to mind so much
when you thought i got away with it .
but you didn &apos;t get away with it .
and i can &apos;t justify handing you a promotion
on the same day that you lose a huge client .
one client doesn &apos;t make a firm .
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve noticed ,
but we &apos;re in the middle of an economic meltdown .
companies aren &apos;t exactly lining up
to spend money on attorneys right now .
and , you know , gerald might have forgiven the lying
had you not humiliated him .
but you did , and you need to accept that .
jessica , if you hadn &apos;t done as much for me as you have ,
i &apos;d be heading for the door .
if i hadn &apos;t done as much for you as i have ,
i &apos;d be throwing you out the window .
but , harvey , no more shenanigans .
you do one more thing that isn &apos;t straight as an arrow ,
and instead of covering your ass ,
i will put you in front of the bar myself .
mike .
who &apos;s ready for a great first day ?
i &apos;m gonna have to let you go .
what ?
i just got reamed for lying to a client ,
and if they find out that i lied about you going to harvard ,
they &apos;ll take away my license .
you what ?
not now , donna .
look , i have to put my own interests above yours .
it &apos;s nothing personal .
you &apos;re fired .
wait , so you &apos;re worried that if i stay ,
then they might find out that you lied about me
and you &apos;ll lose your license .
but if you fire me ,
then i could tell them that you lied about me ,
and you &apos;d definitely lose your license .
are you telling me that
if i throw you under the bus ,
you &apos;re gonna drag me with you ?
you put your interests above mine ,
and i &apos;m just putting mine back up next to yours .
you &apos;re rehired .
so should i-- all right .
here &apos;s what &apos;s gonna happen . you &apos;re gonna give me back my promotion ,
and that &apos;s the last we &apos;re gonna talk about this .
and why is that ?
because if you don &apos;t ,
i &apos;m gonna go across town and join rick peterson .
i &apos;m gonna approach every client i &apos;ve ever closed ,
and i &apos;m gonna take them with me .
you do that ,
and you &apos;ll force me to put you in front of the ethics board .
i don &apos;t think you will .
and why not ?
because you were obligated to notify them
the second i lied to gerald , but you didn &apos;t .
you put me in front of the board right now ,
i &apos;ll put you right up there with me .
i &apos;ll ... i &apos;ll give you your promotion .
but you have to do something for me .
anything .
pro bono .
anything but that .
harvey , pro bono cases are how we , as a firm ,
show that we care about more than just ourselves .
i &apos;m not saying we shouldn &apos;t do them .
i &apos;m saying i shouldn &apos;t do them .
and it &apos;s how you can show me
that you care about more than just yourself .
you &apos;ll handle this yourself .
you will not pass it off .
absolutely .
your first case .
awesome . what is it ?
pro bono .
sexual harassment .
don &apos;t tell anyone i laid it off on you ,
and don &apos;t screw it up .
got it .
you can &apos;t handle it . i &apos;ll knock it out of the park .
easy , clarence thomas .
just go meet the client .
hey . didn &apos;t i tell you to get some better suits ?
i spent $ 500 .
for how many suits ?
five .
what ?
nancy ?
mike ?
yeah , hi .
you &apos;re a kid .
no , i &apos;m a-- i &apos;m a grown man .
you &apos;re so skinny . have a grape .
thank you .
why don &apos;t you tell me your story ?
it started two years ago .
i was a stay @-@ at @-@ home mom
to my son , freddie .
and one day we were at little league ,
freddie was five .
he really hated that he couldn &apos;t play with the older kids .
it was the third inning , and i got a phone call .
my husband had been in a car accident ,
and he was gone , just like that .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i did the best i could .
i got myself a job as a secretary
at devlin mcgreggor .
and i even got promoted to secretary of the president ,
charles hunt .
and that &apos;s when it all changed .
it &apos;s okay . tell me what happened .
he started asking me to stay late ,
order in dinners together , stuff like that .
one night , he says that if i sleep with him ,
he &apos;s gonna take care of me in the firm ,
and , if i don &apos;t , he &apos;s gonna fire me .
so what did you do ?
i went to human resources .
they said they investigated ,
couldn &apos;t find anything to support my claim .
two months later , i was fired for poor job performance .
they wouldn &apos;t let me say good @-@ bye to anybody .
they wouldn &apos;t write me a letter of recommendation .
i wasn &apos;t looking for a payoff .
all i wanted was for it to stop .
can you help me ?
uh , yes .
yes , i can .
what do you need my help for ?
wait , can i just--
no , give me the update .
you know , she &apos;s a nice woman .
she--
on the case .
i don &apos;t get emotionally attached to the client .
this woman had her life ripped apart .
you don &apos;t even care ?
i &apos;m not about caring . i &apos;m about winning .
why can &apos;t you be about both ?
i &apos;d explain it to you ,
but then i &apos;d have to care about you .
right .
what are you doing ?
don &apos;t touch that .
i &apos;m just checking my lock .
you ride your bike to ...
it &apos;s locked , okay ?
come on .
defense sent over the investigation files as a courtesy .
no , they didn &apos;t .
nobody does anything as a courtesy .
they sent those files
because that &apos;s where they want you to look .
listen , being a lawyer &apos;s like being a doctor .
you mean how you don &apos;t get emotional about the client ?
no , i mean you keep pressing until it hurts .
then you know where to look .
forget about impeaching the investigation .
it won &apos;t lead anywhere .
no employee &apos;s gonna testify against their own ceo .
okay . so what do you suggest i do ?
think . this guy &apos;s done this once ...
he &apos;s done it before .
and if the people who work for him now won &apos;t testify against him ...
someone who used to work for him might .
you know what , i &apos;d subpoena the personnel records of every woman
who &apos;s left the firm during this guy &apos;s tenure .
that &apos;s funny . that &apos;s exactly what i thought .
then what do you need my help for ?
i don &apos;t know how to fill out a subpoena .
donna , can you show me how to fill out a subpoena ?
absolutely . and after that ,
you want me to show you how to wipe your ass ?
it &apos;s funny , because you should already know
how to do both those things .
ha , yeah , that &apos;s hilarious .
what &apos;s that ?
that &apos;s my suit guy .
go in , tell him i sent you , and spend some money .
what does it matter how much money i spend on suits ?
people respond to how we &apos;re dressed ,
so like it or not , this is what you have to do .
that &apos;s weird , you giving me advice .
it sounds like you actually care about me .
i don &apos;t . you &apos;re a reflection of me ,
and i absolutely care about me .
so get your skinny tie out of my face and get to work .
that was a little harsh .
really ?
yeah .
mike .
where are you going ?
it &apos;s 6 : 30 . i &apos;m going home .
okay . what &apos;s so funny ?
you &apos;re a rookie associate .
if you go home before 9 : 00 on your first week ,
you &apos;re not gonna make it through your first month .
and louis litt wants to see you .
hey , can i ask you something ?
mm @-@ hmm .
this tie , is it too skinny ?
yeah .
right .
i know you had orientation from rachel ,
but i wanted to give you a special welcome from me .
amongst other things ,
i &apos;m sort of the disciplinarian of the associates .
you wanted to see me ?
yes .
gary , please come in .
mike , this is gary lipsky .
gary &apos;s one of our most promising associates from last year .
hi .
gary , ms. pearson wanted me to ask ,
have you completed the petramco filing ?
well , my brother was in over the weekend ,
so i didn &apos;t really get to it .
look , i mean , gary , come on .
this is , like , the third time i &apos;ve had to ask .
i &apos;ll get right on it .
don &apos;t bother . you &apos;re fired .
what ? you can &apos;t fire me .
oh , yes , i can . and i just did .
go pack up your things .
don &apos;t you ever show your face in this place again .
see , i arranged for you to see that
because we pay our associates very well
and we provide the opportunity for unlimited advancement .
but in return we expect results .
have i made myself clear ?
yeah .
great .
welcome to pearson hardman .
feel free to go back to work .
harvey .
okay , i have two words for you .
absolutely beautiful .
you think you &apos;re the only one who can charm a client ?
categorically stunning .
how &apos;s the new kid working out ?
regally hot .
you &apos;re an idiot .
jessica pearson .
good night , harvey .
what are you doing here ?
watching sportscenter .
you won &apos;t return my phone calls .
ah , yeah , because you set me up .
do you remember that ?
you think i knew about that ?
here we go .
round 50 of i get the shaft
because you didn &apos;t know the whole story .
you knew there were risks
when you quoted that crap from that book .
okay , you needed money ,
and i came through with an opportunity like always .
besides , you weren &apos;t the only one who got screwed .
they pulled a gun on me .
oh , really ?
and why did they do that ?
to keep me from warning you .
so you did know .
well , not until after it was too late .
well , it &apos;s too late now .
look , let me make it up to you .
oh , you want to make it up to me ?
give me my key back .
michael .
come on .
you know i don &apos;t want to live in a world where we &apos;re not tight .
then kill yourself .
get out .
get the hell out .
donna , i need the--
oh , also i didn &apos;t have a chance to--
marry me ?
i took care of that too .
we &apos;ve been married for the last seven years .
excellent .
umm , devlin mcgreggor &apos;s fighting the subpoena .
they filed a motion to dismiss the case
based on our lack of evidence .
good .
good .
wait , what do you mean , &quot; good &quot; ?
they don &apos;t want to hand over the files .
you pressed where it hurt .
you &apos;re looking in the right place .
did you think they wouldn &apos;t fight back ?
well , i-- now that you mention it .
oh , my bad .
i keep forgetting you don &apos;t actually know anything .
the idea is ,
you make a move , they make a move .
you go back and forth until one of you wins .
okay , what if they win the motion
and the case gets dismissed ?
you &apos;re not as good as you think you are .
harvey . what a coincidence .
i was wondering how the pro bono was coming .
i &apos;m all over it .
that makes me very happy ,
because if i were to find out
that you weren &apos;t putting in your full effort ,
i &apos;d be very upset .
no worries . we &apos;re all good .
rachel ! rachel , rachel , rachel . i need your help .
there &apos;s a hearing on my subpoena .
i &apos;ve got three cases in front of you ,
so you &apos;re gonna have to wait in line .
no . no , no , no .
my hearing is tomorrow .
so why are you coming to me ?
because donna says
you &apos;re the best researcher in the firm .
let me see the motion .
you have an office ?
how do you have an office
and i have a cubicle ?
like you said , i &apos;m the best researcher in the firm .
really ?
i just made that up .
i didn &apos;t even have time to talk to donna .
is this all a joke to you ?
&apos;cause i take my job seriously .
no , i &apos;m sorry .
look , i was--
look , you weren &apos;t there , okay .
i care about this woman .
she &apos;s got nowhere else to turn--
and you can &apos;t help her by yourself .
i can .
i just prefer not to .
okay .
you &apos;re asking to look at private files without any evidence
of your assertion .
yeah , but the only way that we can find
the evidence is to look at those files .
it &apos;s a rickety argument .
but is there a precedent ?
let &apos;s go see if we can find one .
research is as much art as science ,
so we &apos;re gonna look at privacy and harassment law
so you can find a combination of cases to make an argument .
i &apos;ll take privacy .
i &apos;ll take harassment law .
this &apos;ll take a while .
we &apos;re gonna need dinner .
chinese .
no .
i can afford chinese on my own .
this is on the firm . i want sushi .
so they told me to put my top investigator on it .
what did you do ?
what could i do ?
you were out of the country , i gave them luderman .
by the way , that dress ...
what , this old thing ? come on .
beautiful .
vanessa , why don &apos;t we do this more often ?
&apos;cause it always ends the same way .
then why are we doing it now ?
harvey , i don &apos;t sleep around .
and i could never be in a relationship with you .
all you ever think about is yourself .
i &apos;m thinking about you and me right now .
please . i insist .
but i &apos;m a gentleman .
besides , you came through on dockery for me ,
and i &apos;m not one to forget a favor .
neither am i.
mr. dockery , you naughty , naughty boy .
you remember when i said you thought you were too smart
to be a paralegal ?
why ...
aren &apos;t i a lawyer ?
i don &apos;t test well .
what ?
i am smart .
and i know i &apos;d be a good lawyer .
i just-- i don &apos;t know what it is .
i can &apos;t take tests ,
and i bombed the lsats .
and even if i could get into law school ,
there &apos;s no way i &apos;d pass the bar .
so if only there was someone who could take the test for me .
yeah , if only there were .
yeah .
hi . where are you at with the research for tomorrow &apos;s hearing ?
nothing yet .
you say you care about the client ,
but if you keep playing footsie
instead of finding me an argument ,
the client &apos;s gonna lose .
i don &apos;t want to lose .
look , it &apos;s no use .
okay , their investigation &apos;s by the book .
we look like the bad guys coming in ,
putting them under duress .
what did you just say ?
i said we look like the bad guys .
no , you said
they did it by the book
and we &apos;re putting them under duress .
yeah .
look .
this is good . we &apos;re gonna have some fun .
we ? i get to go ?
you didn &apos;t think i &apos;d let you come along ?
no .
good instinct . i wasn &apos;t .
but then i thought it &apos;d be cruel not to let you
witness my greatness .
okay , can i go get my bag ?
no .
you &apos;re a true giver .
other side .
okay .
your honor , this case should be thrown out .
other than her story ,
the plaintiff doesn &apos;t have one piece of evidence .
because the evidence lies within their personnel files ,
which they &apos;re conveniently refusing to hand over .
those files contain sensitive information .
he &apos;s fishing at the expense
of our employees &apos; right to privacy .
please . they don &apos;t give a rat &apos;s ass
about his employees &apos; right to privacy .
sorry , that &apos;s actually unfair to rats &apos; asses .
your honor , mr. specter &apos;s claim that
we don &apos;t care about our employees ,
though belittling , doesn &apos;t carry any weight as a rule of law .
true , but what does carry weight is that an investigation
of sexual harassment must be conducted without any duress .
your point ?
the investigator and every person being interviewed
answers to the ceo they &apos;re investigating .
that is the definition of duress .
it &apos;d be as if your bailiff accused you of sexual harassment
and you assigned your stenographer to investigate .
now how likely would it be
that this investigation yielded any fruit ?
you honestly think i would harass herman ?
well , i don &apos;t know , your honor .
some people have a thing for the uniform .
i &apos;d like to think herman would come to me
before it even got to an investigation .
i saw that . that should be stricken .
but what if herman did come to you , your honor ?
and you betrayed his trust
by firing him under false pretenses ?
you really think that little of me ?
i wouldn &apos;t trust you as far as i could throw you .
your honor .
hand over the files ... today .
that &apos;s it .
herman , i &apos;d like to speak to you in chambers .
that was awesome .
it was your argument .
i just framed it in a way that humanized the situation
and brightened all of our afternoons .
i feel like michael corleone
in that scene where that fat guy teaches him how to shoot that gun .
are you saying that i &apos;m the fat guy ?
&apos;cause i &apos;m not the fat guy .
you know what his name was ?
yeah .
cordoza .
clemenza .
i knew that .
i was just testing to see if you knew it .
i knew that you knew that i knew .
train wreck .
hey , i &apos;m looking for rene .
i &apos;m rene . i &apos;m sorry .
we don &apos;t sell skinny jeans at this location .
did harvey tell you i was coming , or ... ?
harvey specter sent you ?
that &apos;s another story .
do you know your inseam ?
i don &apos;t . it &apos;s probably a medium .
oh . why don &apos;t you browse for a while ?
these are the most exclusive ,
and we move down in price
as you head to the door .
oh . okay .
large ?
that &apos;s not how it works .
so trevor &apos;s getting you to do his dirty work for him , huh ?
all i know is you aren &apos;t talking to each other .
i miss you .
i want things to go back to the way they were .
i miss you too . but ...
i &apos;m not sure things are ever going back to the way they were .
i gotta go .
what did he say ?
he said things aren &apos;t ever going back to the way they were .
what did you do ?
i don &apos;t know .
so the files are on their way .
we won ?
that &apos;s fantastic .
so now we have a week
to corroborate nancy &apos;s story .
listen , i couldn &apos;t have done it without you .
you wouldn &apos;t even know where to look without me .
you know what nobody likes ?
nobody likes a showoff .
hello .
yeah , he &apos;s here .
okay . thank you .
files are in conference room c.
why wouldn &apos;t they bring them to my cubicle ?
they &apos;re trying to bury you in paperwork .
well , they picked the wrong guy .
if they didn &apos;t , i did .
get it done by the end of the week .
i got to run and charm our new client .
nice to finally meet you .
jessica says you &apos;re gonna sweep me off my feet .
i &apos;ll do my best , mr. dockery .
you got a nice serve there .
working on it .
what the hell is this ?
it &apos;s you having sex with a woman who isn &apos;t mrs. dockery .
are you trying to blackmail me ?
you asked my firm
where you &apos;re vulnerable to corporate takeover .
that &apos;s it right there .
what are you pulling here ?
your wife owns 10 % of the company &apos;s voting shares .
you &apos;ve been seeing this woman and several others for quite some time .
how do you think your wife &apos;s gonna vote after she finds out ?
who says she has to find out ?
my investigator got these within a week .
what do you think a motivated competitor &apos;s
gonna dig up in a year ?
i have a solution .
trade her your preferred shares , which have no voting rights ,
for her common shares , which do .
the preferred shares are worth $ 2 million more .
a fraction of what you &apos;ll lose
if you get voted out of your company .
john , i don &apos;t care if you sleep with every woman
in the hamptons .
just give her the preferred shares .
jessica said you were gonna charm me to get my business .
i &apos;m not interested in getting your business .
i &apos;m interested in keeping it .
i know where they don &apos;t want us to look .
did you get through all those files in one night ?
i would have done it faster ,
but i ordered a pizza .
speaking of which , have you ever had the cheese in the crust ?
because it blew my mind .
what &apos;d you find ?
there was a dismissal on march 12th , 2005 .
but the file with the employee name on it is missing .
it &apos;s our woman . i know it is .
i &apos;m moving to slap sanctions on their attorney ,
possible jail time .
guy &apos;s not gonna know what hit him .
dennis , it &apos;s harvey specter .
did you have anything to do with the march 12 , 2005 files
left out of discovery ?
if they &apos;re here by noon , i &apos;ll believe you .
if not , we &apos;re filing for sanctions .
threat of sanctions is better than filing for sanctions .
that &apos;s what i meant . threaten , not file .
who would mean that ?
shave .
have you ever heard of this woman ?
joanna webster ?
no . why ?
the company &apos;s trying to hide her from us .
you think hunt did the same thing to her
that he did to me ?
yes .
then you have to make her come forward and say so .
yeah . that &apos;s the plan .
thank you .
joanna webster ?
can i help you ?
hi . my name &apos;s mike ross .
i &apos;m a-- i &apos;m a lawyer .
i have some questions for you
about your time at devlin mcgreggor .
please . look , just let me tell you a story about my client , okay ?
fine . just a second .
mr. ross ,
what happened to me happened six years ago .
it was horrible ,
and there was a reason i didn &apos;t do anything about it .
they &apos;ll put me on that stand and attack me ,
and i don &apos;t want that .
ms. webster , joanna ,
this man is a predator ,
and if you don &apos;t help stop him , he will do it again .
all you have to do is give a deposition .
i &apos;m sorry .
i can &apos;t do it .
what happened with the witness ?
i failed ...
to not be awesome .
i got her to testify !
you should have seen me . i tried everything .
he &apos;d do it again ,
i &apos;d be with her every step of the way ...
nothing worked .
and then it hit me .
i asked her what if it was her daughter
that he did this to .
she melted .
and you know how i came up with that little gem ?
i cared about her .
thank you .
i &apos;m glad to see that staying up all night
doesn &apos;t make you act like a complete idiot .
go home and get some sleep .
i don &apos;t want you waving that thing around
during tomorrow &apos;s deposition .
harvey .
how &apos;s the pro bono going ?
great . i just talked a witness into testifying .
really ? what &apos;s the witness &apos;s name ?
i &apos;m not an idiot .
don &apos;t treat me like one .
you pawned off the case .
jessica , i &apos;ve got higher profile cases--
need i remind you that when we first met ,
you were a screw @-@ up ?
i gave you a shot at the mail room ,
led you up the ranks , and then paid for you to go to harvard ,
where , by the way , you jerked off the entire time
you were there , and i still hired you .
and you &apos;ve benefited from that ever since .
look , i closed the dockery case , okay .
you made a promise to me .
you broke it , and then you lied to my face .
so let me be clear . this isn &apos;t professional .
this is personal .
and i &apos;ll tell you something else .
you made your bed , you better goddamn win .
what the hell is wrong with you ?
i need the briefcase back .
oh , so that &apos;s what this has been about , huh ?
you don &apos;t care about our friendship at all .
you &apos;re my oldest friend , and you know it .
but you don &apos;t seem to care about that anymore ,
and , yeah , i need the briefcase back .
and i &apos;m gonna find it , mike .
well , i ditched it when i was running away
from the cops that you sent me into .
mike .
where you going ?
to my cubicle .
no , you &apos;re not . it &apos;s pee in a cup time .
i &apos;m sorry . what ?
drug test . follow me .
i &apos;m just gonna put my stuff back--
now .
oh , by the way , my cousin was your year at harvard .
and i asked him if he knew you .
it &apos;s so funny . he didn &apos;t .
well , what &apos;s his name ?
mitch samberg
yeah . don &apos;t know him .
it &apos;s a big school .
not really .
we get 7,000 applications a year .
you think you can just walk in and take a tour ?
oh , mitchell .
with the slicked back hair ,
graduated seventh in the class .
sure . yeah . i remember him .
time to face the music .
yeah , what &apos;s up ?
i got to get to the kendrick filing .
where the hell is mike ?
i don &apos;t know .
leave the cup on the counter .
you &apos;ll have to leave that out here .
why ?
if you take it in there with you ,
i have to check to make sure you don &apos;t have
another urine sample in it .
where you been ?
hi . um ...
getting drug tested , actually .
the deposition &apos;s this afternoon .
before they get here ,
i want you to grill this woman about her background
for anything they might use against her .
you got it ?
got it .
make her tell you everything .
everything .
everything .
everything .
okay .
okay .
i had been working six months
when mr. hunt started asking me to work more ,
order dinner .
one night , late , he tried to have sex with me .
the next day , i requested a change in assignment .
two months later i was fired for having a bad attitude .
this is ridiculous .
wipe that smirk off your face .
you &apos;re not even supposed to be here .
mr. hunt has every right to be here .
now , ms. webster , after working for devlin mcgreggor ,
you then went on to waitress at hooters , right ?
yes , i did .
a place that advertises the sexuality of its waitstaff , correct ?
you will have to ask them that .
i &apos;m asking you .
and she &apos;s not answering . move on .
ms. webster , would you say that you &apos;re a truthful person ?
yes .
so when you said earlier that you had never been arrested
for a crime , you were speaking the truth ?
yes .
yes ,
so in 1993 then you were not arrested for stealing
$ 1,000 worth of jewelry
from the willow grove mall in pennsylvania ?
i was 17 . that was one mistake .
those records were supposed to be sealed .
so when you say those records were sealed ,
what you mean to say is you thought you could get away with a lie ?
no , that &apos;s not it .
you &apos;re making it seem different that it is .
i &apos;m sorry . you were arrested in your past
and you lied about it here under oath .
is that making it seem different than what it is ?
no answer . hmm , all right .
let me ask you this , since you &apos;ve lied here once ,
what &apos;s to make us believe you &apos;re not lying about mr. hunt ?
how the hell did you miss that arrest ?
i did every background check we have .
did you grill her like i told you to ?
it was a sealed record , harvey !
goddamn it , i knew it .
fix it .
joanna ! wait . please !
this is why i didn &apos;t want to testify .
they twist something from 100 years ago
and make me look like a liar .
they make it sound like what he did to me didn &apos;t happen .
it doesn &apos;t matter . all right ?
i just--i need you to testify on friday
and keep this case alive .
we don &apos;t have time to find anyone else before--
would you please wait ?
no . i &apos;m not waiting .
you promised this wouldn &apos;t happen , and it did .
you never told me you were arrested .
don &apos;t contact me again , please .
what happened with the witness ?
nothing . nothing happened . i couldn &apos;t fix it .
so you &apos;re going to quit ?
it &apos;s either that or have louis litt fire me .
what are you talking about ?
my first day , louis fired gary lipsky
for screwing up a case .
he said if i did the same thing
i &apos;d be gone just as fast .
well , you go back to the witness &apos; house
and you get her to testify again .
i tried . there &apos;s no way .
there &apos;s always a way .
then why don &apos;t you go and convince her ?
because you screwed it up .
oh , and you don &apos;t give a damn about the client . right .
that &apos;s not my job .
does your job
include giving a damn about me ?
because the least you could do is offer
to stand up to louis for me .
stand up for you ?
i put my ass on the line for you ,
but it turns out you may have had the balls to get this job ,
but you don &apos;t have the courage
to stick it out when it gets tough .
that &apos;s not true .
isn &apos;t it ?
you &apos;ve had one foot out the door
since you got here .
what are you talking about ?
i &apos;m talking about that briefcase being locked in your desk .
yeah , i saw it . and i know what it is .
it &apos;s your backup plan in case this doesn &apos;t work out .
you can make some quick cash
and go right back to the life you told me you didn &apos;t want to lead .
so if you want to quit , go ahead .
but this isn &apos;t because of louis , and it isn &apos;t because of me .
it &apos;s because you &apos;re afraid you might have to admit
that you &apos;re not as smart as you think you are .
if you &apos;re here in the morning ,
i &apos;ll know i still have an associate .
hey , i get that you were upset
that i was promoted before you ,
but if you ever threaten to fire one of my guys again ,
i am going to kick your ass .
what are you talking about ?
don &apos;t play dumb with me , all right ?
you fired gary lipsky in front of mike ross .
what &apos;s so funny ?
gary lipsky works in the mail room .
what ?
i didn &apos;t fire anyone .
that &apos;s how i let the new associates know
what &apos;s expected of them .
you plant a fake employee to manipulate the assoc--
that &apos;s it .
what ?
michael .
i want to quit .
come here .
when your parents died ,
i lost my son and my daughter @-@ in @-@ law .
i was scared , alone , and i was too old to raise you .
but i had no choice .
because who else was going to care of my grandson ?
you made me a promise before .
you &apos;re in the door .
promise me now the only way you &apos;ll leave
is if they rip you out .
you can save your breath .
there &apos;s no way i &apos;m testifying at the hearing tomorrow .
that &apos;s not why i &apos;m here .
i know what you did .
what are you talking about ?
you never worked for devlin mcgreggor ,
and you were never harassed by mr. hunt .
that &apos;s a l--
now i could tell you
that i &apos;ve got the canceled checks or the wire transfer
or whatever smoking gun that exists--i don &apos;t .
but i will . and when i do ,
you &apos;ll be going to jail
unless you tell me what happened right now .
i &apos;m the guy you tell .
all i had to do was waste your time
until tomorrow after the hearing .
please , i just needed the money .
i don &apos;t want to go to jail .
here &apos;s what you &apos;re gonna do ...
did you call this place before ?
mike !
hey .
i &apos;m not giving this to you
because you need it .
i &apos;m giving it to you because i don &apos;t .
and i don &apos;t know if i &apos;m ready to forgive you yet or not ,
but i do know we &apos;re even .
wait a second .
i ...
well ...
don &apos;t .
now we &apos;re even .
i see you came to work today . nice suit .
it was a barter transaction .
i got six of them for one little briefcase .
listen ...
i &apos;m sorry and--
forget it .
when i first started , jessica rode me so hard ...
i quit once a month .
i just told you what you needed to hear .
that &apos;s just it . i &apos;ve only ever had one person
who told me what i needed to hear .
maybe it &apos;s time i started trusting somebody else .
merry christmas .
is this for real ?
you know what to do .
press until it hurts .
wire transfer from your account to joanna webster &apos;s ,
phone records with joanna webster
prior to her testimony ,
and an affidavit stating you paid
ms. webster to falsely testify .
mr. hunt , harassment is a civil violation .
the penalty is money .
but witness tampering , that &apos;s a crime ,
and you will go to prison ,
where i guarantee you &apos;ll learn
more about unwanted sexual advances
than you can possibly imagine .
do you think this is going to intimidate me ?
even if this evidence was credible ,
who are you going to get to prosecute
a small @-@ time witness tampering charge , huh ?
harvey , didn &apos;t you graduate law school
with the current u.s. attorney in new york ?
in fact , i did .
and i think he might even be interested
in pursuing a case like this .
wait , are you two still close ?
well , i was the best man at his wedding .
no , you weren &apos;t .
you &apos;re bluffing .
no .
i think i &apos;ve got some pictures ...
of us at the ceremony .
let &apos;s see .
yeah . here we are .
you must admit , i look very dashing .
this is me and his mother .
the woman adores me .
here we are at his bachelor party .
there &apos;s no strippers . it was lame .
but he can &apos;t put guys like you away for sexual harassment
and then go to strip clubs , now , can he ?
all right . what do you want ?
an admission of guilt
and a guarantee that you &apos;ll obtain treatment before working again .
and nancy gets reinstated with back pay .
fine .
and a raise .
okay . all right .
are we done ?
the kid should be able to grow up without the burden
of tuition hanging over his head , don &apos;t you think ?
which is why you &apos;re also gonna pay nancy
an extra $ 250,000 .
charles .
gentlemen .
you ...
thank you for everything .
you &apos;re welcome .
so just one question .
why &apos;d you go to joanna &apos;s house ?
because i figured it out .
i object .
i think you did it because you care .
i did it because it &apos;s my job .
would you admit it ? you care about me .
i saw you smile when i showed up for work this morning .
i didn &apos;t smile . i was thinking of a funny joke .
look , we start on this tomorrow .
does this mean we &apos;re officially a team now ?
i wouldn &apos;t move your things into wayne manor just yet .
so now you &apos;re batman ?
closer to him than clemenza .
oh , yeah , kilmer .
clooney .
