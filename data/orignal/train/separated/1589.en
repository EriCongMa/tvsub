So, any idea when you guys might decide
if I can go on tour this summer?
Yes, you can go.
My parents want us to stay in motels,
or they won't let us go.
Won't let you go.
Mariana came to see me yesterday.
She thought I should ask you to adopt the baby.
And I think it's a good idea.
Have you heard anything about Tasha?
I get my first supervised visit on Saturday.
What? Why didn't you tell me?
Last time I seen her...
She won't remember that.
What if she remembers being scared
'cause some stranger took her?
Callie, can we ask you a few questions?
What about?
Do you remember buying this?
Because the salesperson remembers selling it to you.
Is that a crime?
No, but kidnapping is.
I'm 16. Aren't I allowed to
have a parent here when you ask me questions?
I'm Robert Quinn. I'm Callie's father.
Look, Callie, it was Christmas.
Your friend, Daphne, just wasn't thinking straight.
She missed her baby. She saw an opportunity,
and she took her.
I might've done the same thing if that was my kid.
That's a sad story, but what does it have to do with my client?
Kidnapping is a very serious crime.
Now, we don't think your client had anything to do with it,
but obstructing justice is also serious.
Do you have any actual questions for Callie?
Honey, we understand you want to protect your friend.
But what about that little girl?
How scared she must have been being taken from the park
by a stranger.
Look, all you have to do is tell us the truth.
You gave Daphne this wind-up toy
that Tasha was holding when she was returned.
Isn't that right?
Or maybe you really were involved.
Maybe you helped.
That's why you don't want to talk.
OK, enough.
Are you seriously trying to connect my client
with an alleged crime through a Tito the Chihuahua toy?
How many of those things do you think are out there?
A few hundred thousand?
But only one was sold at this store.
And she bought it.
Says who?
Says the salesperson that sold it to you, Callie.
The same day Tasha was kidnapped.
You got a receipt?
Look, we asked a question.
Why don't you just let your client answer?
Because you're flying blind here.
All you've got is a wind-up toy and a far-out theory.
We're done here.
Yeah, this is good, I'll walk from here.
Thank you for coming.
Yeah, no, I'm... I'm glad you called.
I would've called Stef and Lena, but...
But, Callie, if you're just protecting Daphne...
I'm not just protecting her.
OK, then you do exactly what the lawyer told you.
They can't prove that you
bought that toy or that you gave it to Daphne.
The only way they can connect you to what happened...
Is if I talk, I know.
You can't tell anyone, even me,
anything that could get you in trouble.
And I don't want you talking to Daphne about this.
Or any one else.
This is a very serious crime.
Anyone involved with this in any way
could go to jail.
And Stef, you know, she's a police officer.
She can't protect you,
not without risking her own career.
I know. That's why I didn't call her.
Look, it's gonna be OK.
You call me if the police
try to question you or if you need anything.
I'm gonna take care of this.
And you. OK?
Ok.
Wait a minute.
What do you have to say for yourself, young lady?
Getting up at 6:00 AM on a Saturday to go to work.
Impressive.
Oh, well, I'm volunteering at the drop-in center later
so I had to pick up the breakfast shift.
Oh, yeah, they do a big breakfast hamburger business?
Yeah, like, eggs and stuff.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just tired.
Well, don't run yourself ragged, honey.
You can always cancel your shift at the center.
No, no, I'm fine.
They need the help, trust me.
Oh, uh, Daphne's here. I almost forgot.
Daphne's here?
Yeah, we told her she could wait in your room.
Thanks.
Hey. Everything OK?
No.
I don't have anything to wear.
Wait... farm party? Like haystacks and stuff?
No, dude.
It's, like, pharm, p-h-a-r-m.
Admission is $10 cash plus a prescription pill,
现场音乐
which they toss into a big bowl and pass around.
So wait... people just take whatever pill they pick,
without even knowing what it is?
That's beyond stupid...
I mean, we don't have to do it. We just have to play.
Do you wanna go on tour or not?
I mean, you could end up making a lot more than
the $200 we're guaranteed if there's a big turnout.
What do you mean, "I could?"
We're giving you the money.
All of it?
All of it. It was Lou's idea.
Really?
OK, thanks.
But I don't want Mariana coming, OK?
Just in case.
Are you gonna be the one to tell her she can't come?
'Cause I'm not.
I'm not afraid of Mariana.
You should be.
I think of it as a healthy fear.
She has a way of getting what she wants.
Did she talk to you about the tour yet?
What about it?
You told Ana that she should ask us to adopt her baby?
No.
I mean, yeah, kinda.
Was she mad?
What?
She wasn't mad.
She actually agreed with you, Mariana.
She asked us to take the baby.
She did?
Oh, my God. You guys, this was totally meant to be.
I mean, we lost Frankie...
Whoa, whoa. Slow down.
We haven't made any decisions yet.
What do you mean?
We'd be saving this baby from a terrible life.
We don't know that, love, we don't.
You said yourself that Ana has no business taking care of a baby
when she can't even care for herself.
This is a huge commitment, honey.
And your mom and I need to
talk about this before we make any decisions. OK?
Ok.
You know, I don't get it. You took Jude and Callie in.
And this baby, she's my sister.
Ouch.
You know, I wonder if Ana's talked to Mike about this.
He's gonna lose it.
He's been working overtime trying
to convince her that she can stay clean and do this.
Exactly.
She's probably just gonna change her mind anyway.
Yeah, but what if she doesn't?
What are we gonna tell the twins then?
We tell them we have to do what's right for the whole family.
You wanted a baby.
I didn't just want a baby, honey.
I wanted the experience of being pregnant, of giving birth.
And as horrible as I feel saying it,
I wanted a child that was biologically a part of me.
That's not horrible.
It's not that I would have loved Frankie more,
I just... I wanted what you have, all of it.
Foster, adopted, and biological children.
I understand.
I know you don't think I can, but I do.
It's just not the way it happened.
And maybe whatever it is that controls our destiny,
you know, whether it's fate or God... or whatever.
Maybe... maybe it's just
opened a different door for us to walk through.
Nothing too... white lady goes to brunch.
I want to look like me, just like the nice me.
Why don't you just wear what you're wearing?
You look fine.
It's not like Tasha's going to care.
It's my first visitation.
I just want it to be perfect.
What about that?
Really?
Yeah.
It's gonna be fine.
You know, Tasha's just gonna be excited to see her mom.
She's not gonna recognize me
as the lady that took her from the park now.
Will she?
No. No way.
Flintwood has one of the best athletic programs in the country.
Wrestling, for example.
We've been national champions
in our division three of the last four years.
Just three? Slackers.
All right. Well, we also offer top notch academics.
The best education money can buy.
It sounds cool, really cool.
I'm not gonna sugar coat it, school's not really my thing.
Look, a lot of our students have those challenges.
And this is where being an all-boys school can really be helpful.
There aren't any distractions.
But I like distractions. Especially girl ones.
Don't worry, there'll be plenty of time to socialize.
But we've tailored the curriculum to the ways boys learn best.
Which is, you know, not necessarily
sitting still inside a classroom.
We take an active approach
with an emphasis on sports, and camaraderie.
Kinda like the military.
Have you thought about college?
I've thought about how embarrassing it's going to be
when everyone gets in... and I don't.
That's not gonna happen,
not if you treat Flintwood the way you treat wrestling.
You worked hard and it paid off.
You went from being a promising wrestler
to one who is being recruited by a prestigious school.
You did that.
Even if I wanted to check it out, my moms couldn't afford it.
We have a big family and I'm an eater.
That wouldn't be an issue.
I'm offering you a scholarship.
You mean it'd be free?
Yes.
When did that happen?
When I went to the eye doctor and couldn't read the chart.
So, what, you wear glasses now?
No. You will never see me wear glasses.
No one will ever see me wear glasses.
I just need to figure out these contacts.
I don't think I can watch.
I know.
It's making me nauseous.
Speaking of things that make me nauseous,
Mat said you want to come on tour with us.
No way. That's not happening.
Ok.
What... I'm sorry, what? What's OK?
You're allowed to have your opinion.
But it's not really your decision to make, it's Moms.
Come on, Mariana. We're not bringing girlfriends.
You're bringing yours.
Yeah, she's in the band!
Look, I'm prepared to do my part.
I'm gonna sell merch and help with bookings and stuff.
I'll be like your manager.
OK. There's still no way in hell
Moms are going to let you go.
I mean, they're barely letting me go
and that's only if I raise all this money.
Which I can help you with.
How?
Oh, look. We're already up to 150.
That's cool. That's really cool, actually.
But I still don't think Moms gonna let you go.
Why? Because I'm a girl?
That's a total double standard.
Our moms are feminists.
No, because you're 15, Mariana.
Oh, please you're not even a whole year older than me.
And don't be so sure I can't convince them.
I'm gonna tell them I'm gonna keep an eye on you.
Maybe I don't want the responsibility of keeping my eye on you.
Which is what I'm going to tell them.
And speaking of which,
I don't think you should go to the gig tonight.
OK, it's gonna be a rough crowd.
Brandon, that's very sweet,
but if it's too scary for me to go,
well, I should probably warn Moms about it, right?
I mean, do you think they want you
playing in front of a "rough crowd?"
Glad we had this talk though.
I'll see you tonight!
Jimmy.
Hey, can you cover the desk for me?
Yeah, sure. Hey, is that your friend, right there?
The one who's having her visitation today?
Yeah.
Cool. Tell her good luck.
Thanks.
Hey. You look nice.
This is a mistake.
She's... she's gonna remember me.
Why was I so stupid?
Daphne, listen to me.
Everything is gonna be fine.
But you have to stop we can never talk about that ever again, OK?
Look who's here.
Can you say, "Hi"?
Can I give her a hug?
So Jesus is going to the movie, Brandon's band is playing
and Jude is going on another "group date,"
so, looks like we're on our own tonight.
Really? Home alone.
What ever will we do?
We could order in. How about Mexican?
Yeah, we could do Mexican, but it's awfully... filling.
Uh, Thai?
Spicy.
You love spicy.
Spicy's not sexy.
You think you're getting laid tonight?
Well, it has been a while.
I didn't know we were keeping track.
I'm not keeping track.
It's just...
It hasn't just been me.
I know. It's both of us.
So... you wanna...?
Yeah, sure, I mean,
how often do we get the house all to ourselves?
We gotta take advantage of it, right?
Absolutely. So...
Wine? Oh, please.
Get the good stuff.
I came by to help you load up.
Thanks, but Mat was here a while ago,
and I think we took care of it.
Sweet.
All the credit, none of the work.
Hey, thanks for giving me the door tonight.
Mat said it was your idea.
I'm sorry I wasn't being more supportive.
I really don't wanna go without you.
I don't want that either.
But I thought about it and you have to.
If I can't go, I mean.
And, I mean, don't worry, I get it.
You've worked so hard for this.
You have to do it, OK, no matter what.
Careful. I don't want to mess up my look.
Do I...? How do I look? Am I OK?
OK, let's go.
Yes.
OK.
You wanna do a bigger one?
Yes, a bigger one.
OK, do a bigger one.
So how long have you been in?
Foster care, I mean.
Six years.
I was in for eight.
My dad took off and my mom was... is mentally ill.
You were a foster kid?
Oh, yeah.
Coulda used a place like this back then, that's for sure.
It sucked, but, you know,
it inspired me to go to grad school, become a social worker.
Right some wrongs, maybe.
You know?
Did you ever find a permanent placement?
No, no, I ended up living in a group home until I aged out.
How about you?
How's the home you're in now?
I love the family I live with.
They even adopted my brother.
Oh. But not you?
I know you took her!
Go on! Play with her. Play with her like nothing happened!
You may have everybody else fooled, but I know!
Wendy, Wendy...
I know what you did!
This isn't appropriate.
I saw you!
I've seen you before at the park!
I know you took her!
I know you took my baby!
You need to leave. You are not allowed to be here.
But she is?
Ma'am, that's enough. You need to leave. Now.
I'm so sorry, Ms. Keene...
Don't apologize to her, she's a criminal.
You might have them fooled, but I know better.
And believe me, I'm gonna make damn sure
the police figure it out, too.
There's no way I'm letting that baby girl go back to you.
Tasha belongs with us.
You can't do that. She's my baby!
Mommy!
Sweetheart.
You would take Tasha back to me and leave.
I will bring her back to you at the end of the visit.
It's OK. I'm gonna see you back at home in just a bit, OK?
Be good, baby.
If you care about Tasha, if you really care about her,
you should let her go.
It's OK. It's OK.
Hi. I'm with, Someone's Little Sister.
Good for you. Whose little sister?
The band. I'm with the band.
Who isn't? Where's your cover?
Seriously?
Fine.
And where's the rest of it?
A pill. You need a pill.
Dude, dude, she's with the band.
What, so, as long as a guy
tells you I'm with the band, then you believe me?
Please don't get into a fight with the bouncer.
What's with the pills? I thought it was a farm party?
Like barn animals.
I wore denim.
This band is cute.
We could make some real money tonight.
No, I'm good.
What're you doing?
Having fun. Relax.
Callie, what was all that. I don't get it.
If Tasha's foster mom is screaming at the police,
telling 'em I took Tasha,
how come they ain't ever questioned me?
They don't have any proof.
You don't know that.
Maybe they have something and they're just waitin'.
Maybe I should get outta town or somethin'.
No, Daphne, stop, you don't have to run.
I know they don't have any evidence
because they came to the burger stand
this morning to question me.
Why the hell you ain't tell me?
'Cause Robert's lawyer told me
I couldn't say anything, even to you.
OK, I was trying to protect you.
I didn't ask you to do that.
I know.
How'd they know to come to you if they ain't got no evidence?
You remember the toy, wind-up dog I gave you?
You gave it to Tasha, right?
So they traced it back to the store
where I bought it and the clerk ID'd me.
What?
Yeah, but it's cool though.
'Cause they can't prove that I gave it to you.
I think the cops probably came to me
thinking that I would tell you
and that you would panic and do something stupid,
but you're not going to, right?
You're going to stay calm. Hey.
I don't know if I could do that.
You know me, Callie. Staying cool is not my strength.
Well, you have to. All right, if not for you, for me.
Hey, and for Brandon.
And Tasha. OK?
Hey. Do you know this p-h-a-r-m party?
I didn't even know that was a thing.
Yeah, that's why I didn't want you to come.
Are you... you're not gonna take anything, are you?
No! That'd be...
Beyond stupid.
Yeah.
Time for us to set up.
Wish me luck.
You don't need it.
Why are you winking when you say that?
Wait, are you being ironic in that way I totally don't get?
No, no, there's just...
There's something in my... I'm all good.
I just... I gotta find a bathroom.
But kill it! I'll be the one hollering the loudest.
I should come with you.
No, no! You're about to go on.
I'll be quick. Don't worry about me.
This is totally my scene.
Sorry. Excuse me.
How you feeling?
Dude, chill.
I'm fine. I just like to take the edge off before I play.
It's a great crowd. Let's have fun.
Excuse me. Is there a bathroom around here?
This ain't the House of Blues, it's a warehouse.
People are peeing out back behind the dumpsters.
Want me to meet you out there?
No. No, thank you.
......I told you to lock this up.
My equipment's spendy.
Someone's in here! I'm in here!
Hello!
Hello! Someone's in here!
Daphne Keene.
We'd like to ask you a few questions.
Great job today.
I try my best.
Well, you succeed.
You have a ride home?
I'm just gonna take the bus.
Oh, no, I'm happy to drop you off.
Really, it's fine.
Thanks.
Hey, can I ask you something?
What was all that about, this afternoon?
I mean, was that woman
seriously accusing your friend of kidnapping?
I don't know. She wants to adopt Daphne's baby,
so I guess she thought...
love makes people do crazy things, I guess.
Actually, I think I'm just gonna take the bus.
But thank you.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to pry.
No, you didn't.
Hey, what's up?
OK, slow down. OK.
Hey! Are you OK?
Are you all right?
Don't feel bad about it, honey.
We've got a lot on our plates.
Yeah, well, you know, so do Molly and Tracy,
but to hear them talk about it,
they go at it like bunnies.
Yeah, well, they don't have five kids
and three birth parents to worry about.
And any couple who says they're always having sex, isn't.
Remember Hope and Kim?
They used to always brag
about their sex lives and then when they broke up,
Hope told me they hadn't had sex in six years.
You're kidding me! Six years?
You know what, my love, I am not complaining about our sex life.
I just... I just... I just don't want us to get complacent.
I mean, I want us to stay on it because, I'm sorry,
but lesbian bed death is a real thing. It's real.
More wine?
I thought you would never ask. And you know what?
I think after that, we should head up to bed, naked,
and make it happen.
Last one to bed has to be the top!
Hey! You're a cheater.
That's an unfair advantage. Such a... You're so...
Help!
I need you to stay awake for me, can you do that?
Maybe we should try and walk around a little.
Oh, my God!
I'm sorry.
I think I had too much wine.
Maybe next time we should have sex before dinner.
Or maybe we should have dinner.
And less drinks.
It's fine. It's fine.
I know, I know, I know. But at least you, you know...
You got there.
You did get there, didn't you?
I... sorta got there.
It didn't sound like you "Sorta got there."
Did you fake your orgasm?
No! I didn't fake it.
I... may have embellished it a little.
What?
Why?....
I didn't want to hurt your feelings, love,
and I had an emotional... one.
An emotional orgasm?
Why does sex have to be so goal oriented?
It doesn't.
Which is why you don't need
to embellish anything to make me feel better.
OK. There was a lot of pressure tonight, I think.
All the pressure to have sex tonight was coming from you.
Ok, ok...
For the record, I would have been happy just cuddling.
Then let's cuddle a bit. Let's just cuddle, OK?
You have been fake to before?
Oh, come on, haven't you ever?
No. Never with you.
And can I just say, please, that going forward
if one of us, you know, can't get there,
we just be honest about it.
We've been together for ten years. I mean...
Well, it is true that you know, sex gets a little harder
after you've been with someone for so long.
It's not as new and exciting
like it was in the beginning.
Come on.
I still get excited every time you walk through the door at night.
It may not be new, but it's better.
This is my favorite part.
Of tonight?
Of everything.
Me too.
We have to remember to take care of us, OK?
In a little more than a year,
Callie and Brandon are gonna be gone
and the twins after that...
Thank God for Jude.
At least we'll be able to have some more "Us" time...
I mean, unless we...
We take Ana's baby?
What do you think? Do you want to?
Thank you! We're Someone's Little Sister!
We're touring this summer, check us out online!
Hey Callie, what're you doing here?
Mariana called me. She's locked inside a storage unit.
What? Where?
Somewhere around here.
This is Rafael. We work together at the drop-in center.
Have you seen Mariana?
Cops!
This is the police! Stop the music! And stay where you are!
Stop the music.
I repeat. This is the police!
Stay where you are! We have a medical emergency.
I'll repeat, we have a medical emergency.
We need you to stay put
and stay quiet so the EMT's can do their jobs!
You gotta get outta here.
Callie! What are you doing?
What's going on?
Help! We need help!
Stay back. Just stay where you are.
In here, please.
In here!
Oh, my God! Hurry! She's barely breathing.
What's her name?
I don't know.
I don't know her.
Do you know what she took?
No idea.
She's OK. Go.
She's on probation. Take her.
Go, I'll take care of Mariana, go.
Miss, can you hear me? Open your eyes.
Can you hear me?
Ma'am.
At least no one got arrested.
We didn't get paid either.
Go ahead and say it.
I know you're dying to.
OK, fine. This is why it's a bad idea for you
to come with us on tour with us this summer. You can't handle it.
What was I supposed to do, let the girl OD
so the show could go on?
No, but if you hadn't been locked
in a storage unit in the first place...
Then no one might have found her and she could have died.
I'm sorry my stupid contact were bothering me.
Contacts?
Since when?
Not the hot issue here, Mat.
So, yeah, I'm sorry I got locked in a storage unit.
But I am not sorry that I called the police and possibly
saved that girl's life.
I didn't say that calling the police was a mistake.
I "handled" myself fine.
You're just mad because you know
you shouldn't have been playing a gig like that anyway.
I didn't realize Mariana wanted to go on tour with us.
You're totally right, it's a terrible idea.
We don't have time to be baby-sitting her on the road.
Yeah, because I'm going to be busy baby-sitting you.
What are you talking about?
You totally screwed up
on stage tonight when you took those pills.
Come on. It wasn't a big deal.
Because I covered for you.
Is that what it's gonna be like on tour?
Is this what it's gonna be like on tour?
You judging my every move?
You tell me. I mean,
are you gonna get too high every night to perform?
I forgot a lyric.
That happens when I'm sober, too.
And I barely felt anything from those pills.
Half the stuff people bring is Aspirin.
Is that supposed to be comforting?
I'm not the one who screwed up tonight, OK.
Thanks to your sister, we didn't get any money for the gig.
This is not Mariana's...
She did the right thing, OK? That girl almost died.
She's fine.
This could have been you...
I don't... care that you forgot some words to a stupid song.
I care that you took some freaking mystery pills
and didn't think about what would happen next.
This is me caring.
Not judging.
I guess I'm just...
not used to people caring about me like that.
Well get used to it.
You're right. It was dumb.
I'm sorry.
I promise when we're on tour, I'll play all our gigs straight.
Ok.
You're wrong about one thing though.
Our songs aren't stupid.
They're awesome. At least mine are.
You're not mad at me because you didn't get paid, are you?
No.
I mean, I was a little blind-sided by that contacts reveal, but.
I'm being serious.
So am I.
Look, I don't think Brandon meant to hurt you.
I think he was just upset at Lou
and it came out wrong.
Well, I'm sure they'll work it out before we go on tour.
I don't want you to go on tour. Please don't hate me.
What?
I'm sorry.
I should have told you sooner, but I was...
Are you, like... breaking up with me?
No, no. I don't wanna break up.
Or see anyone else.
It's not like that at all.
It's just, I've been dreaming about this tour for years.
It's a chance for me to really focus on my music before...
I don't know, life takes over.
It's something I want to do, just for me.
I wouldn't stop you from doing that.
I know.
But I would stop myself.
OK, tonight, through out the entire set
I was scanning the crowd looking for you.
And not because I was worried,
but because I love you and I want to...
...when you're in the room,
you have my undivided attention.
I'm sorry if that hurts your feelings.
Why are you crying?
I'm not it's... It's just my contacts.
Mariana...
OK, fine.
I'm upset...
Really?
Really, but I'll get over it.
You promise?
Promise.
Oh, Jesus, come here...
What is it?
I need you to do something...
Nice glasses.
I'm supposed to be in here,
convincing you guys to adopt Ana's baby.
Mariana asked me to.
Are you guys really thinking about that?
Well, we were hoping to talk to the both of you about this.
So you're not...
Look, Jesus, the only reason we would even consider taking Ana's baby
is because we love you and Mariana very much
and this baby would be your sister.
And yes we wanted a baby.
But things change, honey.
We were just now sitting here talking about
how nice it is to get to spend some time alone together
every once in a while, just the two of us.
The truth is, we have so many legal expenses right now,
trying to fight for Callie,
it's hard enough to put food on the table for five kids every night.
What if you guys had one less kid to feed?
After today, you must think I'm some kind of magnet for trouble.
No, no...
I just hope that your friends,
and your brothers and sisters,
don't get you into trouble like that all the time.
I make way more trouble for them.
You never told me why you didn't get adopted.
My birth father is fighting for custody.
Is he a bad guy?
No, but I just found out about him.
And this is my home.
I love Stef and Lena
and I really want to be a part of the family.
But what?
I did something...
...that they don't know about and I can't tell them
because it would be really bad for a lot of people.
I just feel so bad lying to them.
You know, I can't even look them in the eye
and after everything they've done, they don't deserve it.
Callie, you have to tell them, whatever it is?
You're not listening to me. I cannot tell them!
It would ruin lives and not just mine.
What're you gonna do?
I mean, I'm sure Flintwood is a great school and all...
It is. It's one of the best in the country.
I'm not ready to say goodbye to our son.
I know. We're supposed to have two more years.
You don't think this is the Universe punishing us
because when we were in bed
we said there would be some pluses
to having the kids out of the house? We didn't mean tomorrow.
He's just a baby.
Hey, sweet.
How was the center?
It's good, pretty good.
There's something I have to tell you.
OK.
I think it would be...
I think...
I should go with Robert.
