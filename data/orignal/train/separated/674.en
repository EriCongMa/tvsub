The white-haired man is dead.
His name was Gordon Murphy.
I found this on him.
He kenw my mother.
Have you seen this man?
What's he wanted for?
Kidnapping.
Show this to Charlotte. It's one of my father's journals,
or at least my version of it.
There is one person I wish to welcome her into the fold...
Amanda Clark.
You and your new family were all over the news.
I'm committed to our child.
I just don't think I can commit to you.
It's me. God, Gordon, please be okay.
I love you.
Some think intuition is a gift.
But it can be a curse as well.

A voice calling to us from places
that are better left unexplored.
An echo of memories that will never die
no matter how hard we try to kill them.
So...
reconsidered my apology?
You found my mother.
Received at 1:21 a.m.
It's me. Where are you?
Um, some guy claiming to be a detective Lasky
came by with a sketch, asking questions.
I know what I'm supposed to do.
What, that's your mother's voice?
And I checked.
Detective Lasky doesn't exist.
Where did you go yesterday, Aiden?
How did you find the flight recorder?
I lifted a key off
your would-be killer's body before you knocked me out.
Look, if the woman on that message really is your mother
and she's as deeply involved with the man
who killed your father as it appears,
the Initiative are gonna be all over her.
This detective Lasky is probably one of them.
All the more reason I need to find her.
And tell her what?
Have you thought how she might react
when she finds out that Gordon's dead?
I didn't kill him.
And if she asks me,
I'll have no problem telling her who did.
Right, will that be before or after you tell her
who you really are?
Or maybe she'll save you the trouble by recognizing you.
Think, Emily.
This woman has the power to
destroy everything you came here to do.
We don't know what her motives are.
The white-haired man had nearly 20 years to brainwash her
into believing anything he wanted.
That--that is exactly the point I've been trying to make.
Before you track her down,
you better be prepared for what you might find.
Em--
This is a terrible idea.
Bringing the Initiative back into our lives
is a recipe for disaster.
Well, perhaps you should've thought of that
before you made then broke a deal
with one of their deadliest assassins.
And it's not an invitation, in any case.
It's a summons.
Oh, and it has to be you?
Is that worry I detect in your voice?
Yes, it is.
Worry that you will screw things up
like everything else you lay your reptilian hands on.
As much as I'd like to send you in my stead, my dear,
I need you here,
dealing with what's truly important,
like planning our wedding.
Morning, all.
Where are you off to?
Client meeting in Palm Beach.
Due to recent events, some of our high-rolling investors
are a little jittery.
And you're going to calm their nerves,
get in some face time?
Good strategy, dad.
Well, thank you for the vote of confidence.
It's in short supply around here.
Well, don't worry.
I'll hold down the company fort while you're gone.
Why is there a man installing a camera outside my bedroom?
Ah, that's a necessary evil, my dear.
I mean, there are worst places to be imprisoned.
Oh, you mean like the rehab you locked me up in?
I was referring to
your mother's little hideaway in the woods.
I will see you in a few days.
Charlotte,
just before the press conference,
you told me that Amanda knew the truth about her father.
What did she tell you?
She didn't tell me anything.
It was all in the journal my dad kept while he was in prison.
I'd like to see it.
I'm sure you would, but it belongs to Amanda.
You'll have to ask her.
Good morning.
Morning.
Where are you off to?
Uh, Daniel will fill you in.
Uh, and... after he does,
do me a favor, and don't take your eyes off him until I return.
Given the way he was blatantly licking my boots at breakfast,
it's pretty obvious he's up to something.
Then rest assured, I'll find out what it is.
Okay.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Anytime today.
We'll be here. Thanks. Bye.
That was the city inspector.
It's... D-day.
No kidding.
Where are you going?
Did you mean what you said last night?
You don't have to move out.
I said I'm committed to our son.
But not to me.
And since him and I are one and the same, at least right now...
Amanda, wait.
For what, Jack?
Exactly.
Amanda, I made up the guest room for you.
You can stay as long as you want.
What were you thinking
by forcing that witch to publicly embrace me?
Or--or is this
just your way of getting jack to dump me once and for all?
No.
Then what?
They killed your father. I get it.
But your obsession with making everyone pay
is ruining lives,
namely my baby's.
My mother's still alive.
What?
I-I thought she died when you were a kid.
So did I.
But for...
some reason, my father lied to me.
Victoria's the only person left
who could possibly tell me where she is.
Oh, my god.
I needed you to put my father's journals on her radar.
Hopefully...
what I wrote in them will be enough to get her to crack.
Right on cue.
Answer it.
Uh, hello.
Amanda,
It's Victoria Grayson.
I trust you're well.
I am, thanks.
I'd like to invite you to come over to our home this evening.
There are a couple of things that you and I need to discuss.
How about 6:00?
I can make that work.
Wonderful.
Oh, and, Amanda...
would you mind bringing over the journal that you shared with Charlotte?
I can do that. I will see you at 6:00.
Till then.
Looks like you've hooked your fish.
This wouldn't be so painful
if you kept better records.
Some of this unopened mail dates back six months or more.
Only Luddites use snail mail.
Go right in, Ms. Thorne.
Hi. Sorry to interrupt.
And here we were, not even speaking of the devil.
Emily, you remember Padma.
Of course. Hello, Padma.
Nolan, do you have a minute?
I'll just get started on all this mail.
She's cute.
You think?
Don't you?
So to what do I owe the pleasure?
You hardly ever write. You never call...
Were you able to hack into the Graysons' security system?
Unless you need something.
Turns out the software their security company is using
is proprietary to a subsidiary of Nolcorp.
I'd say you got lucky, but I know better.
Now you can monitor... Boris and Natasha's every move.
Voila.
And what about the remote earwig?
Let me guess.
Playing sock puppet with Amanda again?
Can I help?
I've got everything under control.
But thank you, really.
Nolan, I found something you need to look at.
Another love letter from the I.R.S.?
No.
It's from your father's estate attorney.
What's it say?
It says his belongings are being held in storage
and will be auctioned off if not claimed.
Why didn't you tell me he died?
Because this is the first I'm hearing of it.
Uh, let's get back to work, shall we?
Why are you blowing up my phone, Porter?
I gave you your take.
Yeah, and I'm giving it back.
The stuff we stole the other night, I need it, now.
Maybe you don't get how this works.
I don't know what happened,
but the guy has my I.D.
He comes by last night,
says he's gonna go to the cops if I don't get him his stuff back.
So what'd you do with it?
You left your I.D.?
You think this is funny.
I covered your ass. You understand?
You gotta help me.
Look, I can't.
The guy who sells the stuff that we stole,
he'd break our legs just for asking.
There's nothing I can do.
New friend?
No.
What's all this?
I got a problem, Jack.
I want you to know
that whatever issues you and I may have had,
I loved your father very much.
You and I both know there's more to that story.
You may have had my father fooled,
but you don't fool me.
Don't piss her off.
Not yet.
Read her the first passage.
"I'll never forget the night Victoria and I met.
"New year's eve, 1991."
"In her eyes, I saw kindness and fire
and something else--
a deep sadness to match my own.
It had been two years since I had said good-bye to my wife.
And the pain of that loss was as crippling on that night
as it was the day I laid eyes on her for the last time."
Let's cut to the chase, shall we? How much?
For the journal. How much?
I don't want your money.
Then pray, what do you want?
I want to know about my mother.
Read her the next passage.
"the only person to whom I ever confided the truth about Kara
was Victoria."
What truth is he talking about?
All I know is what he told me.
That your mother died in a mental institution
when you were a very little girl.
Perhaps a similar fate awaits you.
Did you... ...meet her?
No,
and if you think I'm going to fall prey to your emotional extortion,
you are sorely mistaken.
Tell me everything you know about my mother,
and I will give you this journal.
All I can tell you
is that your mother
was the source of all of David's pain.
Now...
if you don't care to share his writings,
that's your prerogative.
But you're family now.
and it's my hope that one day you will share them,
if not out of respect for me, out of love for your father.
Mom.
Amanda. What's going on?
We were just discussing Amanda's baby shower.
What baby shower?
Well, the one that we're throwing for her tomorrow.
It's impromptu, I know,
But I thought it would be a fun way for you
to celebrate being an aunt.
Say yes.
And I would love to welcome...
We need another pass at her.
Amanda into my public circle.
Yes.
I feel like the luckiest girl in the world.
Daniel.
I thought you went home.
I thought you did, too.
What are you still doing here?
Final details on the Dubai teleconference in the morning.
You?
Same.
Uh, my laptop froze.
I was just... using my Dad's computer
to print these out for the call.
All right, enough.
Can we just be honest with each other?
Haven't we always been?
I'm worried.
Ever since you shared your suspicions about the ransom,
I keep thinking, if Conrad were engaged in some impropriety,
couldn't we all be implicated?
Not if get to the bottom of it first.
And whatever he's done, I promise,
he's gonna be taking sole responsibility for it.
And you would do that, turn on your own father?
What, you think he wouldn't do the same to me or Charlotte
or you?
Hey, hey, hey. We're-- we're closed.
Um, there's--there's a bed-and-breakfast
about 20 miles east...
Oh, you again.
Odd time to be closing up shop.
The season's just getting started.
What's odd is, you were an American the last time you were here.
I work for the FBI. Deep cover, same as Gordon.
I know his feelings for you
ran beyond professional obligation.
Where is he?
His last communique indicated
his identity had been compromised.
His direct orders were to return here.
Why should I trust you?
The people Gordon was infiltrating are incredibly powerful.
You need to tell me whatever you know
about whoever he's been in contact with.
I'm gonna stick to the plan, his plan.
Good-bye.
Sorry, Ms. Clarke.
But I cannot let you do that.
You're awfully quiet this morning.
I just keep thinking about what you said to me last night,
about being implicated in what my father's done.
I just don't want to see you get dragged into it.
Into what?
My parents, they've destroy people.
You can't imagine what they're capable of.
I have a pretty good imagination.
You can trust me.
Look, the kidnapping.
It wasn't real.
The money my father pretended to pay in ransom
was actually used to inflate investor returns.
But that could bring down the entire company.
You gotta trust me.
I've got a plan.
Are you gonna get that?
No.
The man's called me three times today
to confirm the eastern exposure on his Palm Beach Hotel suite.
You should get dressed. We're late.
What is this?
It's proof that Victoria knew my mother.
She visited her in the hospital.
It's signed Charlotte Clarke.
Why would Victoria admit
to signing in under a different name?
Leave that to me. I'll do the talking.
I don't know if I'm up for this.
Amanda, please.
Look, if we do this, if I find my mother,
we can be done.
You will never be done.
Please. I need you to call Victoria.
Tell her that you've reconsidered.
Tell her that you'll take the money for the journals
and ask her to write you a check for $100,000.
What do we need her money for?
We don't need her money.
We need her signature.
Where are you going?
To think.
What can you tell me about a lawsuit Zingstur.Com
brought against you in 2001?
You ever hear of them?
No.
That's because they lost.
End of story.
You all right?
Yeah.
Whew. I gotta get some air.
You know the original owners
fought 20 years for the right to develop this land?
Only to see their dreams
of turning this swamp into a thriving metropolis
burst like a proverbial bubble.
They put in all the work.
You buy on the cheap
and reap all the benefit.
It's a zero-sum world, Mr. Grayson.
One man's loss, another man's gain.
We appreciate you coming on short notice.
I didn't realize I had a choice.
You always have a choice.
It's whether or not you're able to live with your choices
is the question.
So I take it you've been watching the news very closely
since your agent went rogue, taking my wife hostage.
Yes.
Yes, a curious betrayal after decades of
loyal service to the organization.
He's been making subsequent threats,
and I fear for my family.
I need assurances that you can control him.
As far as we're able to discern, he's off the grid,
but rest assured, we will find him.
And when we do, we'll be most interested
in hearing his side of the story.
We'll be in touch.
So you got my message?
I did.
I'm not gonna lie to you. I wasn't happy to hear it.
Yeah, I'm sorry we, uh,
couldn't get all your stuff back,
but...
this should put a dent in it.
It's $2,500.
That doesn't even cover the watch band
your brother stole.
Tell me what it's all worth. I'll make it right.
The watch, the Babe Ruth,
everything they took--
You're looking at $20,000 minimum.
I can file an insurance claim.
That'd mean involving the police.
No, no, I...
I'll get it.
It's just...
The bar has been closed. I'm not that liquid.
But we got inspectors coming today,
So... once we reopen,
I should be able to start paying you back.
I will give you one month, hmm?
I mean, hey, I know where you live, right?
Hello. Right this way.
Emily.
Come in. Come in.
Is Amanda with you?
She's not here?
Uh, no,
And I'm starting to worry mom's responsible.
You never know with her.
Truer words...
Emily.
I had no idea you were invited.
Well, I am the baby's godmother, so...
Oh, really?
Isn't that a religious tradition?
I didn't take Amanda for being a god-fearing woman.
She doesn't fear much.
Certainly not tardiness, huh?
Wow. Swanky.
I told you, my sister's family is loaded.
Hope we didn't hold things up.
Not at all.
I see that you've brought your, uh, people.
We used to work together.
Everyone at the club wanted to come,
but Murray wouldn't let us take off at the same time.
And what kind of club is that?
Not bridge, I can tell you that.
Twins?
Just the one.
Shall we?
Yeah.
Victoria Grayson is a liar.
There's no way Gordon did the things
she's accusing him of.
I agree.
I think he's being set up by the group he's embedded with.
What group?
American initiative.
You may remember them from your husband's trial.
Gordon told me everything about you, Kara.
You need to trust me.
The Initiative, they came after me.
Gordon got to me first.
But they were going after Victoria, too.
He saved her from them.
Listen, listen, Kara,
I think I can help Gordon, okay?
But I need to find a link to his captors
so that I can track him down.
Are you--are you sure that he didn't leave anything,
you know, a c--a computer, a phone, papers?
There's a portable hard drive in the safe behind the counter.
I'll unlock it for you.
He said if anyone ever came by
knowing the things that you know,
that I should hand it over right away.
It's mostly codes and addresses...
dates.
Hopefully, you can make sense of it
before it's too late.
Thanks.
Time to open gifts.
To the great room, shall we?
I'm gonna use the little girls room.
Do you mind saving me a seat?
Of course.
So does anyone know any shower games?
Girl, do I.
Nice touch,
bringing your girls from the Beaver Dam.
If I had to suffer another one of her parties,
I thought I'd at least spread the pain around.
I guess this means you're not gonna help me.
That's the other good thing
about the girls from the club...
They're a great distraction.
So how's it look?
Can I tell my employees
they have a job to come back to tomorrow?
Afraid it's not gonna be that simple.
Mold's still an issue.
Wh-what do you mean?
We spent weeks scraping that stuff off the walls.
But you forgot the ceilings and the subfloor.
You need to use an E.P.A. approved contractor
for additional mold remediation.
How much is that gonna cost me?
Usually about 20 bucks per square foot.
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
That's--that's over--
Over $40,000.
Great. Now we can't pay Kenny.
Where have you been?
I've been at your father's storage unit.
My nani never wanted me to come to America.
The week I landed a job interview at J.P. Morgan,
she caught a nasty flu.
My parents sent a ticket, urged me to fly home,
but...
I was afraid if I asked them to push the interview,
I'd lose the job.
Three days later, she was gone.
Regrets suck.
Where is it?
I'll drive you.
Who the hell are you?
The truth this time.
I'm not the enemy. I can tell you that much.
You're making a mistake, Kara.
You made the mistake.
Gordon would never have told anyone
I was once Kara Clarke.
Which means you are either working for the Graysons
or you're working for the initiative.
Because you sure as hell aren't working with my husband.
Whoever it is,
you better hope they send someone.
Gordon chose this remote spot very carefully.
When I come back...
it'll either be with Gordon...
or not at all.
Security, please.
Yes, there's an unauthorized car
in a Grayson Global reserved spot.
A silver Lexus.
Thanks.
You heard from my dad today?
Just long enough to convince him not to rent Yankee Stadium
for the investors' softball game.
Ashley, I just got a call from security.
They said you're parked in an unauthorized spot.
I parked where I always park.
I'll be back.
Received today at 9:08 A.M.
Looks like I missed a call from you.
I assume it has to do with Daniel.
I'll be back tonight,
but if you have something on him, call me.
For your baby shower.
It goes with your real gift.
Oh, my god.
You shouldn't have.
But I'm so glad you did.
Then I am, too.
Last but not least.
It's a baby journal.
Open it.
十万美元整
Um... That is, uh, so beautiful...
and appropriate.
Thank you.
Amanda, are you all right?
Just, uh, kind of exhausted suddenly.
Well, would you like to lie down?
Yeah. Maybe for a moment.
Charlotte, would you escort the ladies to the conservatory
for petits fours and refreshments?
Shall we?
I knew you were a smart girl.
Excuse me.
I'm glad you changed your mind, Amanda.
Tell her you have and that she can have the journals.
You can have the journals.
Well, once I receive them, I'll sign the check.
Go for it. Make her squirm.
Actually, you don't need to do that.
Then what are we doing here, Amanda?
You said that my mother died in an institution.
This is the visitors log from the hospital where she was committed.
My aunt Charlotte signed in
a few days before my father's arrest.
I assume you have a point.
My aunt was an invalid.
She couldn't walk, much less write.
I had my suspicions about who forged the signature,
but I never knew for sure until now.
"Amanda Clarke."
"Charlotte Clarke."
They match.
What happened when you visited her?
This is pointless.
Either you show yourself out or I will have you escorted.
Go after her.
Why were you there, Victoria?
What did you do to her?
Oh, let it go. If your father were here,
he would tell you the same thing.
My father told me she was dead. Why would he lie?
But why?
Why would he make me believe she was dead
when she was obviously still alive?
Because he was trying to protect you.
So am I.
Find out where she is.
Yeah, but from what?
Amanda?
He would rather have you believe that she was dead
than to tell you the unspeakable truth.
What? Tell me.
Amanda. Damn it.
Your mother tried to kill you.
That's a lie.
I wish it was.
And no matter how much hatred you harbor toward me,
it is the absolute truth!
Marta!
Someone, call 9-1-1!
What happened? What happened?
Oh, my god. Amanda.
Amanda.
Amanda.
Yes, we need an ambulance right away.
Oh, oh, god.
Hang in there, Amanda.
Help is on the way.
20s, pregnant female,
blunt head trauma...
Whatever-- whatever happens,
you have to save the baby.
Make sure they save the baby.
No, you're both gonna be fine.
Take this. Call Jack, please.
I'm going with her.
Are you family?
I am.
I'm her sister.
Charlotte.
Mom, I'm going.
Closing.
We failed the inspection.
What are you telling me exactly?
That you can't keep to your word?
I'm saying that this place is my income,
so if I can't open the bar...
maybe there's some other arrangement that could be made.
Jack, I...
Maybe there is. I...
艾米莉
Excuse me.
Oh, thank god.
Jack, it's Amanda.
There's been an accident.
What?
Is she okay?
I don't know.
They took her to Suffolk Memorial.
I'm gonna meet you there, okay?
Yeah.
Hey, listen, it's-- it's my girlfriend.
I gotta... I'm sorry.
We'll work something out.
What up?
You did good.
So did our inspector.
Cool. Did you make an offer on the bar?
After the dust settles.
Let's get started.
阿曼达·克拉克 十万美元整
Victoria!
What the hell happened?
Victoria, where are the children?
They're safe.
It's Amanda Clarke's blood. She fell.
On our property?
You better hope it's not serious.
It's very serious, no matter what her fate.
Just before the accident,
she confronted me with some old log-in sheets
from her mother's hospital.
She's very close to figuring out that
I hand-delivered Kara to Gordon Murphy.
How could she have stumbled upon that?
She couldn't have, not without help.
Oh, welcome home, dad.
Good trip?
Listen, I'm wiped. I'm gonna-- I'm gonna turn in, all right?
Okay.
Okay?
You...
didn't call me back.
Because there's nothing to report.
Daniel only has your best interests at heart.
And as for me, I am done being your little spy.
Who knew there was such a thing as competitive Tetris?
I led a petition to make it a demonstration sport
at the '92 Olympics.
We lost.
I can't believe he held on to this.
Hey, this is all Nolcorp stuff--
investor prospects, start-up budgets.
I founded the company
in my dad's garage the summer before my junior year.
When I told him I wasn't going back to school...
Mm, he kicked me out.
I should sort through it all.
Could be useful for the audit.
Padma...
Thank you for...
taking an interest.
You didn't have to.
It's my job to take care of you.
'Cause...
I was kinda hoping maybe this had...
nothing to do with the job.
Can, uh... we try that again?
I think we should.
And finally, in society news,
Amanda Clarke,
daughter of terrorist David Clarke
and a recent addition to Victoria Grayson's family fold,
has been rushed to Suffolk Memorial
with serious but unspecified injuries.
Amanda Clarke was apparently
at the Graysons' Southampton estate at the time of the accident.
Amanda Clarke's family?
That's us. That's us.
I'm Amanda's...
I'm the father.
How are they?
The abruption's caused a decrease in blood flow to your son.
He's being deprived of oxygen.
The longer we wait to deliver, the worse the outcome.
Then why are you waiting?
It's high risk. Amanda's already lost a good deal of blood.
And we just don't have a conclusive assessment of her internal injuries.
Obviously, we're gonna try to save mother and son,
but if there comes a point where a decision must be made--
The baby. It's what she wants.
She told me when they were putting her in the ambulance.
She's going to be fine. She has to be.
All I can think about is how awful I was to her,
the last things I said.
Jack, don't do that to yourself.
Code blue, Room Three!
Code blue, code blue, Room Three!
Amanda!
How is she?
We had to perform an emergency c-section.
Unfortunately, she was already battling internal injuries
and massive blood loss.
We were forced to induce a coma.
How's the baby?
His oxygen levels are lower than we'd like,
so we've put him in the NICU for treatment.
I'll let you know when you can see him.
Can we see Amanda?
Not just yet.
I'll get us coffees.
What's going on? What are they saying?
Just...
I'm a dad.
But--but that's-- that's great, isn't it?
Amanda...
She's not good, man.
What does that mean, not good?
She's gonna be okay, right?
Jack, I'm--I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for everything.
Come here.
We're gonna be okay.
Go ahead.
You sure?
You okay?
Here.
Take this.
When at a crossroads, my father was fond of saying
"Go with your gut."
"Intuition," he said,
"always has our best interests at heart."
After I finish loading the car,
I'm taking you out,
anywhere you want to go.
Oh. Always wanted to go to Le Meurice.
Mm. In Paris?
You said anywhere.
Okay.
大卫·克拉克 款已付
It is a voice that can tell us
who is friend and who is foe...
Which ones to hold at arm's length...
And which ones to keep close.
But too often, we become distracted by fear,
doubt, our own stubborn hopes,
and refuse to listen.
Hey, you've called Emily. Leave a message.
Emily, it's me. Call me as soon as you get this.
I- I tracked down your mother.
She's dangerous. I think she's coming your way.
It's okay, sweetheart.
Mommy's here.
It's okay, sweetheart.
It's too deep, mommy.
Amanda! Daddy?
Amanda! Amanda!
