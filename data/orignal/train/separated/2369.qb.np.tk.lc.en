does elena enjoy having both of you worship at her altar ?
i &apos;ve heard about you .
the crazy , impulsive vampire .
in love with his brother &apos;s girl .
klaus is a vampire born of a werewolf bloodline .
the curse has kept his werewolf aspect from manifesting .
but if he breaks it ,
he &apos;ll be a true hybrid .
so that &apos;s what a werewolf bite looks like .
tyler lockwood bit me .
we &apos;ll find something .
a cure .
a bite from a werewolf can kill a vampire .
so don &apos;t be his friend . do you understand me ?
promise me no one will find out about us .
where &apos;s stefan ?
he gave himself over to klaus . to save his brother .
just give me the cure , and i &apos;ll do whatever you want .
you want your cure , there it is .
your blood is the cure .
you should have met me in 1864 .
you would have liked me .
i like you now .
you can embrace what you truly are .
leave town with me and save your brother &apos;s life .
that &apos;s the spirit .
rudy .
rudy !
come on .
it &apos;s too hot to make me come looking for you .
i am so sorry .
i didn &apos;t mean to scare you .
can i help you ?
yeah , my , uh , my car ran out of gas a couple miles back .
i feel like i &apos;ve been walking forever .
yours is the first house i &apos;d come to ,
so i was just hoping i could use your phone .
don &apos;t you have a cell phone ?
heh . yeah . battery died .
look , i promise i &apos;m not a serial killer .
i just want to use your phone .
sure .
so ... i can come in ?
no .
i &apos;ll get the phone and i &apos;ll bring it out to you .
i thought you country folk
were supposed to be more trusting .
i &apos;m from florida .
well , that explains it .
now show me a little southern hospitality ...
sweet pea .
i bet you a hundred dollars
that dog ran off to a house with air conditioning .
what &apos;s going on ?
please don &apos;t be alarmed .
i &apos;m told ray sutton lives here .
he &apos;s almost never here .
he &apos;s on the road mostly .
but i expect he makes it home ...
once a month .
that &apos;s what i thought .
where is he now ?
if i have to make you tell me ,
it &apos;s going to be infinitely more painful for you .
i love it when they run .
he &apos;s in tulley .
it &apos;s near the border .
a bar called southern comfort . it &apos;s off highway 41 .
thank you , my love .
now ...
may my friend come in your home ?
yes .
kill this one quickly .
make that one suffer .
i &apos;ll be in the car .
please don &apos;t , please ...
ugh , early . bad .
it &apos;s not early .
you &apos;re late for work . matt just called .
well , maybe they &apos;ll fire me .
aim high .
what are you doing ?
just shopping for the party you &apos;re trying to bail out on .
i never said yes in the first place .
you were never going to ,
which is why i planned it anyway .
and my mom wants you to call her .
did she find something ?
an animal attack in memphis .
it &apos;s the third one this week in tennessee .
and you &apos;re sure it &apos;s a vampire ?
yes , but that doesn &apos;t mean that it &apos;s klaus .
doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s not . i &apos;ll call her .
well . call her on her cell .
tell her , thank you for her help .
all right , well , i &apos;ve got to go . i &apos;ll see you in a bit .
oh , caroline , wait .
just ... keep tonight small . please .
wear something pretty .
hi .
was that , uh , stefan news ?
could be more klaus victims .
you &apos;re certain stefan &apos;s still with him .
easy to be certain
when the alternative is that he &apos;s dead .
are you sure you &apos;re still ok on the couch ?
yeah , yeah . i &apos;m good .
because you spent half the summer on it .
if you need your own bedroom ...
and sleep in your dead parents &apos; room
or my dead girlfriend &apos;s room ...
right .
hey , elena ...
happy birthday .
thanks .
we are out of champagne .
huh . no , you are out of champagne ,
i don &apos;t drink in the morning .
well , would you be a dear and--
i think you can probably get it yourself .
i &apos;m not your slave .
i mean , you &apos;re dripping a little ...
jeez .
mornin &apos; .
hey , i was going--
you heard me .
you knew that i was here .
you know , you should learn to knock .
what if i was ... indecent ?
sheriff forbes gave us another location to check .
memphis .
another dead end , you mean ?
you don &apos;t know that .
you &apos;re right , elena .
this could be the one .
yep . after almost two months ,
this could be the clue that tells us stefan &apos;s alive and well
and living in graceland .
fine .
i &apos;ll go by myself .
and let klaus know that you &apos;re tracking him ?
he thinks you &apos;re dead . let &apos;s keep it that way .
it &apos;s a new lead , damon .
we haven &apos;t had one in a while .
ok . i &apos;ll check it out . if i find anything , i &apos;ll call you .
but ...
he moved on to tennessee .
that florida victim you had me look into
had family in tennessee .
which one , the pensacola guy ?
you up for a road trip ?
ha . no can do .
i have got to work , but i can see if i can get you an address .
see you at the party .
get me that address .
you need to come home .
it &apos;s boring around here without you .
you think you &apos;re bored ?
my dad &apos;s side of the family
is like wet paint that never dries .
how &apos;s the grill treating you ?
well , it &apos;s teaching me the value of a mundane human experience .
a summer job is good for you .
you needed some normal in your life .
what was that ?
nothing .
look , i , uh , i got to get back to work .
i &apos;ll talk to you soon , ok ?
wait , wait , jeremy .
is everything ok with you ?
yeah .
yeah , normal and mundane .
come home soon , ok ?
ok .
vickie !
i need you to switch sections with me .
why ?
caroline and tyler just sat in mine .
so ?
so i don &apos;t feel like waiting on my ex @-@ girlfriend .
something &apos;s up with your mother .
like what ?
when i was over yesterday , she just kept eyeing me .
hey , guys .
did matt make you switch sections ?
he thinks we &apos;re dating .
so does my mother .
what ? !
we &apos;re together all the time . it &apos;s not a leap .
that &apos;s crazy .
right ?
what &apos;s up , bro ?
hey , red .
can i get a beer ?
ray ?
ray sutton ?
who wants to know ?
i &apos;ve been looking everywhere for you .
we started in florida , pensacola .
i met a young chap there who you worked with
before you moved to memphis .
now he directed me to two lovely young women .
and they led me here , to you .
i think i &apos;ll be going .
not so fast , mate .
you only just got here .
now your type are very hard to come by .
yeah , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
vampires .
you &apos;re swifty swift , ray .
yes , my friend here is a vampire .
he &apos;s compelled everyone in the bar ,
so don &apos;t look to them for any help .
i , however ...
i &apos;m something else .
a different kind of monster .
i &apos;ve got some vampire , i &apos;ve got some wolf .
you what ?
a hybrid , ray . i &apos;m both .
you see , i want to create more of me .
now , you being the first werewolf i &apos;ve come across in many a moon ,
pun intended , ray , heh ,
i need you to direct me to your pack .
so ...
where can i find them , ray ?
you can &apos;t compel me , it won &apos;t work .
i need a scotch on the rocks , please .
ahem . tell you what , ray .
we &apos;re going to play a little drinking game .
something i like to call truth or wolfsbane .
oh , this is going to be fun , ray .
elena ?
i don &apos;t know why you just don &apos;t come clean
and tell her where we are .
&apos;cause andie said this was a half @-@ lead
and i don &apos;t want to get her hopes up .
yeah , well , they &apos;re all half @-@ leads ,
and i &apos;m your accomplice .
what do you want me to say to her ?
i &apos;m practically living there .
still sleeping on the couch ?
you know , i keep waiting for them to kick me out ,
but they don &apos;t . i don &apos;t know why .
it &apos;s not like i &apos;m helping or anything .
it &apos;s quiet .
yeah .
too quiet .
vampire for sure .
it &apos;s stefan for sure .
how do you know ?
it &apos;s his signature .
there is a reason they called him the ripper .
he feeds so hard he blacks out , rips them apart ,
but then when he &apos;s done , he feels remorse .
it &apos;s the damndest thing .
he puts the bodies back together .
back together .
definitely stefan .
i feel like i have to fight damon
every single time we get a lead on stefan .
maybe he doesn &apos;t want to find him .
tyler !
what ?
he &apos;s into you .
isn &apos;t he ?
the only reason stefan left with klaus
was so that he could save damon &apos;s life .
i mean , trust me ,
damon wants to find him .
but you kissed him .
probably screwed with his head .
tyler !
i &apos;m sorry .
i--don &apos;t worry about it . look ,
yes , i kissed him , but it was a ...
it was a good @-@ bye kiss . i thought he was going to die .
i just missed a call from bonnie .
i &apos;ll be right back .
just because i tell you things
doesn &apos;t mean you &apos;re allowed to know them !
sorry .
i &apos;ve got to run if i &apos;m going to change
and pick up sophie in time .
wait , you &apos;re bringing a date ?
slutty sophie is your date ?
hey , it &apos;s been kind of slow in that department .
and ...
i am horny all the time now .
yeah , tell me about it .
sometimes i feel like i &apos;m going to explode .
it &apos;s , um , a vampire thing .
you know , our emotions are heightened
and we &apos;re on overdrive , so ...
it &apos;s a werewolf thing , too .
it &apos;s like i can &apos;t turn it off .
yeah .
well , i hope you get lucky tonight .
i &apos;ll see you later .
yeah .
see you later .
what are you doing ?
covering their tracks .
clearly they have no interest in staying in the dark .
but i do .
hang on .
ok .
well , what do you know ?
werewolves .
ray . you can end this right now .
just tell me where your pack gathers
for the full moon .
i can &apos;t .
i know , i know , you live by a code and all that .
but see , he &apos;s not going to let me stop
until you tell me .
and i do whatever he says .
that &apos;s the way it goes around here .
hello , mr.klaus.
i have some information for you .
you told me to tell you if i saw anything .
... i saw that guy &apos;s brother damon at the farmhouse .
well , thank you , claudine .
you just tell your friends
to keep up the good work with the neighborhood watch , huh ?
my brother &apos;s still on our trail ?
he &apos;s getting closer .
i &apos;m going to have to deal with that .
no , no , no . let me handle it .
why should i let you leave ?
&apos;cause you know i &apos;ll come back .
do i ?
you saved my brother &apos;s life .
i &apos;m in your service .
oh , that almost sounds so tedious and indentured .
aren &apos;t you even having the least bit of fun ?
i &apos;ll make sure that my brother doesn &apos;t bother us anymore .
don &apos;t worry , i &apos;m not going to lose it .
at least not before the cake .
it &apos;s your party , you can cry if you want to .
ah , stefan .
such a pack rat .
i got you something .
i know i promised not to buy you anything ,
so don &apos;t worry , i didn &apos;t pay for it .
you stole it ?
no .
found it .
my necklace .
i thought i &apos;d never see it again .
alaric found it in his loft .
i figured you &apos;d be happy to get it back .
i am happy .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
can you ...
ah , absolutely .
shall we ?
happy birthday elena .
thank you .
you don &apos;t want that .
you want the cheap young stuff
over by the cheap young people .
you like ?
don &apos;t answer that .
this is &quot; keeping it small &quot; ?
what are we drinking ?
where did you get that ?
uh , henry from the kitchen sold me a dime .
so , what &apos;s got you on your spiral downward ?
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s a lot more interesting than mine .
you do not want to know .
how bad can it be ?
i already know everything else .
go for it .
you know i died , right ?
and bonnie used magic to bring me back to life .
yeah , elena told me .
the thing is ,
ever since i came back , i &apos;ve been seeing ...
things .
what kind of things ?
just ... things i shouldn &apos;t be seeing .
what &apos;s bonnie say about it ?
no , i haven &apos;t told her . i haven &apos;t told anybody .
it &apos;s just messing with my head , is all .
you know , i just need to chill out .
so ... this .
oh , the stoner den .
buzz kill .
hey , guys .
matt , hey .
happy birthday .
thank you .
he hates me .
his hatred of me has driven him to drugs .
he doesn &apos;t hate you . he hates that he &apos;s not with you .
is that my brother ?
thank you .
i am every parent &apos;s worst nightmare .
i &apos;m the chaperone teacher from hell .
i love high school parties .
isn &apos;t andie supposed to be coming ?
tech on broadcast . she &apos;ll be here in a little bit .
hello , birthday girl .
drink .
jeremy &apos;s smoking again .
is his stash any good ?
you &apos;re an ass .
talk to him , please .
he looks up to you .
you &apos;re screwed .
ok , i--i &apos;m the last person here again .
dave , enough work , please .
can we do this in the a.m. ?
i have a party i have to get to
and you have got to get a life .
ok , all right , bye , bye , bye .
hello ?
not cool , my retinas are burning .
ok , seriously ?
what--what the hell are you doing ?
hello ?
hello ?
no .
oh , stefan . oh , my god .
oh , my god .
what are you doing here ? we have been looking everywhere for you !
stefan ...
since when are they a thing ?
i thought you were ignoring me .
i &apos;m not ignoring you .
well , you &apos;ve only said five words to me all summer ,
and those were four of them .
maybe because every time i &apos;ve seen you ,
you &apos;ve been with him .
&apos;cause he &apos;s my friend .
which is what i thought you were .
aren &apos;t you guys supposed to be , like , mortal enemies ?
i mean , isn &apos;t that how it works
in the vampire @-@ werewolf universe ?
matt , shh !
what is wrong with you ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m , uh ...
i &apos;m out of it , i guess .
yeah .
sorry .
what was that about ?
nothing .
great party , caroline .
thanks .
now leave it .
what the hell ?
andie wants me to pick her up .
your fake , compelled girlfriend
wants you to be a chivalrous boyfriend ?
well , it &apos;s a complicated dynamic .
hold the fort down , will you ?
you mean the fort full of my drunk history students ?
drink more .
it &apos;ll feel less weird .
this room &apos;s off @-@ limits .
caroline ?
sorry .
i just needed to take a beat .
are you hiding ?
i was just looking for damon .
well , he &apos;d better be here somewhere ,
because we haven &apos;t even done the cake yet .
i think i &apos;m going to pass on the whole cake thing .
no ! no way , no ! it &apos;s your birthday .
no , it &apos;s the dawn of a new day ,
and you can &apos;t get on with your life
until you &apos;ve made a wish and blown out the candles .
is that what you all want me to do ,
just get on with my life ?
no .
maybe .
i just don &apos;t think anyone wants to see you like this .
i &apos;m not going to give up on finding stefan , caroline .
of course not . and you shouldn &apos;t .
but you have to admit that you &apos;re kind of
just letting your life pass you by .
and isn &apos;t stefan the one
who wanted to make sure that you lived it ?
you want me to make a wish ?
i just want to know that he &apos;s alive .
that &apos;s it . that &apos;s my wish .
i &apos;m sorry , ok ?
i &apos;m just drunk and dumb tonight .
you know ...
what are you doing ?
what &apos;s all that ?
it &apos;s klaus .
damon &apos;s been tracking him without me .
why wouldn &apos;t he just tell you ?
i don &apos;t know .
andie ...
party central .
where are you ?
i &apos;m by the ... punch bowl .
don &apos;t do that , damon , don &apos;t lie to me .
i saw your closet .
oh , oh , gotta go--gotta go break up beer pong .
wait , damon ...
stefan .
hello , brother .
you don &apos;t write .
you don &apos;t call .
need you stop following me .
causing some problems .
with who , klaus ? i &apos;m supposed to care what he thinks ?
what you &apos;re supposed to do ... is let me go .
saw your latest artwork in tennessee .
walking a fine line there , my friend .
keep that up and there will be no saving you .
see , the thing is ,
i don &apos;t need any saving .
i just want you to let me go .
oh , i got a birthday girl at home
who &apos;s not going to let me do that .
you know , maybe i haven &apos;t made my point .
hey , andie , you still there ?
andie ?
damon ?
i can &apos;t move , damon .
he told me that i can &apos;t move .
no , no , no , it &apos;s ok , andie , stay calm .
not cool , brother .
oh , come on .
it &apos;s a little bit cool , huh ?
hey , andie .
you can move now .
no !
no , no , no , no , no !
i said let me go .
what are you doin &apos; ?
i can &apos;t find my truck .
that &apos;s probably a sign you shouldn &apos;t be driving it .
need a ride ?
you &apos;re more stoned than i am .
what the--vickie ? !
help me .
what &apos;d you just say ?
nothin &apos; .
did you just say &quot; vickie , &quot;
as in my sister vickie ?
what ? no , no . i , uh ,
i didn &apos;t say anything .
no ...
what &apos;s wrong ?
you know what , maybe we should just walk .
excuse me .
excuse me . hey !
what is your problem ? !
you &apos;re pissed that i brought someone ?
why would i be pissed ? you brought a date .
you &apos;re dating . that &apos;s ... awesome .
ok , should i not be dating ?
hey , you &apos;re horny all the time , right ?
i mean , a guy has needs .
&apos;cause if i shouldn &apos;t be dating ,
all you &apos;ve got to do is say something .
if you don &apos;t say something , then i &apos;m going to keep dating .
what would i say ?
don &apos;t do that , caroline !
i &apos;ve already been there once with you , ok , and you said no .
you shut me down . i &apos;m not going back there again
unless you make it crystal clear that you--
let &apos;s get out of here .
hey ! you missed the cake .
what ? what are you doing here ?
why didn &apos;t you tell me ? why did you keep it a secret ?
can we not do this right now ? i &apos;m having a really bad night .
all summer , every single time i came to you with a lead ,
you made me feel like an idiot for having hope .
you were an idiot .
we both were .
tell me what you know , damon .
i know you need to get back to your party , elena .
we &apos;re supposed to be in this together .
why didn &apos;t you tell me you &apos;ve been tracking klaus &apos; victims ?
because they &apos;re not klaus &apos; victims , elena , they &apos;re stefan &apos;s !
what ?
he &apos;s left a trail of body parts up and down the eastern seaboard .
no . you &apos;re wrong .
i &apos;ve seen it happen before .
he &apos;s flipped the switch , to full @-@ blown ripper !
stop it , damon .
no , you stop , elena !
stop looking for him .
stop waiting for him to come home .
just stop !
stefan is gone and he &apos;s not coming back .
not in your lifetime .
all right , i should probably go
before elena and mr. saltzman come home
and see what a bad example i am .
you sure you can walk ?
we &apos;ll see .
can i take the ice cream with me ?
what happened in the car , man ?
nothing .
come on , man .
you said , &quot; vickie . &quot; all right , you said my sister &apos;s name .
why ?
you said you were seeing things ?
i &apos;ve been seeing her .
i mean , i think i see her all the time , too .
it &apos;s &apos; cause i miss her so much , though .
you know , like , i want to see her so i do .
look , i know we &apos;ve got our hands full
with all this supernatural stuff in this town ,
but ...
ghosts .
like i said ,
my head &apos;s all messed up .
okay , it &apos;s a three step process , right ?
this is step one .
i want you to drink from my wrist .
i already told you where to find the pack .
what more do you want from me ?
have you been listening to a word i &apos;ve been saying , ray ?
i have great plans for you .
he &apos;ll thank me for it later , heh .
there we go , that a boy .
what are you going to do now ?
it &apos;s time for step two , ray .
you &apos;re back .
did you doubt me ?
not for a second .
i knew you &apos;d pass the test . you still care for your brother ;
for your old life .
i don &apos;t care about anything anymore .
you put on a good show , stefan .
i almost believe you .
let &apos;s hope , for your brother &apos;s sake ,
he does .
you never stop caring about family , do you ?
but every time you feed ,
the blood makes it easier to let go .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m not going to stay here anymore .
what ?
why ?
i &apos;m not a role model .
you know , i drink too much , i say the wrong things ,
i encourage bad behavior .
at school i can pull it together ,
but in my own life ...
the way i miss jenna , it &apos;s just ,
i &apos;m really not any good to anybody right now .
i &apos;m sorry , elena .
you &apos;re 18 .
you can do all this alone now .
you can do it better without me .
hello ?
hello ?
stefan ?
stefan , if this is you ...
you &apos;ll be okay .
i love you , stefan .
hold on to that .
never let that go .
mrs. lockwood .
hi .
leaving so soon ?
i--i didn &apos;t mean to be so--
i mean , we were just ...
i &apos;m gonna just ...
