clive bixby .
what a sexy surprise .
quick question .
did it hurt when you fell from heaven ?
because you--uh ...
i &apos;m gonna come in again .
we are watching baby joe on valentine &apos;s day
so my dad and gloria can ...
make love .
ew . don &apos;t .
the point is , we are celebrating a day early .
so they can finally be intimate .
you &apos;ve ... more than made that point .
i &apos;m just saying it &apos;s a long wait after giving birth .
six weeks .
i couldn &apos;t keep my hands off this one for that long .
i can only imagine what jay &apos;s going through .
voila .
square knot . impressive .
i can make any kind of knot .
it &apos;s like i have a sailor in my mouth .
i should check on the kids .
haley took &apos; em to a movie . she &apos;s not even gonna answer .
i know , but , sweetie , i have a good reason to worry .
luke had that nasty nosebleed this morning ,
and alex , as usual , fainted .
she &apos;s fine , and dunphy men get nosebleeds .
i told you this when we got married . it was in my vows .
i &apos;m still a little unclear as to why you put them in your vows--
just finish that drink , pretty lady .
we got a big night ahead of us .
okay .
first , we have a date with romance .
a threesome , if you will .
from here , we move on to an old @-@ fashioned blimpnic .
now is that the one where the man has to face out at the woman ...
it &apos;s a picnic on a blimp .
champagne , cheese , and this beautiful city beneath us .
that actually sounds really romantic .
after that , we swap our earplugs for some earmuffs ,
and take a few moonlit turns around the local ice rink .
from there , it &apos;s a quick trip back to the hotel ,
where ...
i &apos;m spinning .
well , i wouldn &apos;t start with that ,
but , uh , we--we can work our way up to it .
no . i &apos;m feeling really weird .
catch that , clive ? just tell me what you want .
juliana ?
claire ?
one of you needs to answer me .
blood pressure &apos;s still good .
i think i can send you home .
great . so it was probably just low blood sugar or something ?
see , honey ? i told you it was nothing to worry about .
well , it &apos;s not nothing .
you did have a small heart episode .
dr. coben , this may have been my fault .
i think i was being ... too sexy .
yeah , i don &apos;t think that &apos;s an issue .
you sure about that ?
um , doctor , you &apos;re not saying that
i had a heart attack or something , right ?
not at all . what you have is a very minor arrhythmia ,
known as wolff @-@ parkinson @-@ white syndrome .
it &apos;s hereditary , so you &apos;re off the hook .
oh , yeah . my mom has that .
we &apos;ll treat it with medication
and have you back in a couple of days .
in the meantime , just take it easy .
okay . thank you !
i guess we should tell your dad
we can &apos;t watch the baby tomorrow .
no . no .
i don &apos;t want everyone to know about this .
they &apos;re just gonna get worried
and--and make a bigger deal of it than it is .
sweetheart , promise me ?
i promise . i know it &apos;s not that big a deal .
this is a huge deal ...
for which i &apos;m partly responsible ,
in spite of what claire &apos;s lesbian doctor says .
hey , honey , i was just reading about this wolff @-@ white thing .
it &apos;s not that serious . you &apos;re gonna be fine .
i know .
who &apos;s ready to hit the ice ?
what ?
come on .
somebody promised me a moonlit skate .
but didn &apos;t the doctor say you needed to take it easy ?
oh , that &apos;s just one of those things they have to say ,
like , &quot; you can &apos;t drink when you &apos;re pregnant . &quot;
come on . we &apos;re not gonna seriously blow off valentine &apos;s day ,
are we ?
no . i just thought why ... ice things down
when we could heat things up ?
oh , i like where this is going .
right ?
yes .
yeah ?
ye--no !
honey , i know what you &apos;re doing .
you &apos;re treating me like a patient ,
and you promised that you wouldn &apos;t .
no .
no , no , no , no , no . i just had a better idea .
what ?
side @-@ by @-@ side couples massage .
just you , me , and a couple cambodian guys
to work us over good .
specific .
what is that ?
you think the kids are home ?
that sounds like more than our three .
they think we &apos;re not home , and they &apos;re having a party .
i &apos;m killing them .
no , no , no . no , no , no .
&quot; a &quot; --it &apos;s my turn to kill them .
&quot; b &quot; --you need to order up those massages .
it &apos;s under &quot; best number one u.s.a. coca @-@ cola good time massage . &quot;
what the hell is going on ? !
dad ? what are you doing home ?
so this is how it is ?
we &apos;re gone for a minute , and you guys throw a party ?
no !
just texted mom we &apos;re having a good time at the movies .
it works every t--aah !
so this is a regular thing ?
no !
you know the drill . coolers our b--aah--ack !
enough ! turn off the music !
everybody who i did not create , get out of my house right now !
i don &apos;t want to get upset .
i &apos;ve been through enough tonight .
what happened ?
i &apos;m not supposed to tell you .
when you say it like that , we make it worse in our head .
fine . it &apos;s no big deal .
your mother had to go to the hospital .
oh , my god !
what ? !
that is so much worse than it would be in our heads !
she &apos;s fine . she just passed out a little .
something to do with her heart .
like a heart attack ? !
mom had a heart attack ? !
mom almost died of a heart attack ? !
no !
she had a little episode , probably triggered by me .
she just needs to rest .
for once , let &apos;s not think about ourselves .
phil , everything okay ?
fine ! i &apos;m coming !
just act like everything &apos;s normal .
oh , and if , uh , two cambodian guys show up ,
send them to our bedroom .
kids had a few friends over .
i handled it .
so you &apos;re good at handling things .
you like ?
me love , but is this appropriate massage wear ?
they were busy , which is what we should be getting .
honey .
honey , are you sure this is okay for your--aah !
salty .
i still have a few moves .
mm , that &apos;s the chips , sweetie .
oh , sorry .
right .
mom , we need to talk to you .
dad told us not to say anything ,
but we &apos;re really worried about you .
you told them ? !
no !
you had a heart attack ?
phil !
that is not what i said .
kids , everything is fine .
call 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 !
oh , god !
her heart exploded !
oh , my god ! i did it again !
phil , it &apos;s your nose !
this is the one thing--
the one thing i ask from you is not to make a big deal of this ,
and you couldn &apos;t even do that .
honey , you need to stay calm .
no , i don &apos;t , because i am fine .
we are all fine .
oh , god .
haley , revive your sister .
not in the mood for an apology , phil .
good , &apos; cause you &apos;re not gettin &apos; one .
i &apos;m allowed to worry about you .
yeah , when there &apos;s something to worry about .
but this was nothing . i told you , my mom has this .
which i just found out about today .
how has that not come up in 20 years ?
i was ... getting to it .
look , i know you feel like
you have to be the rock for this family
and worry about everybody &apos;s boy problems and nosebleeds
and ... who has enough greens .
they &apos;re supposed to cover half the plate .
claire , stop it .
i &apos;m saying you could let us take care of you
every once in a while .
like for example , when you clutch your chest and collapse .
this house isn &apos;t gonna crumble in the dust
if you let yourself be vulnerable .
we don &apos;t know that .
we could find out .
it was kind of scary .
of course .
until i knew what it was , and then--
don &apos;t ruin it .
i just have one more question .
did it hurt ?
well , i blacked out before i--
when you fell from heaven ?
nailed it .
you just take care of claire . we got joe .
gloria ?
si , mi amor ?
happy valentine &apos;s--
wait . wait . wait . time @-@ out .
that was phil . they can &apos;t watch joe today .
claire was in the emergency room last night .
is she okay ?
she &apos;s gonna be fine ,
but , you know , she had a little bit--
okay , good .
i love how you look in this suit .
let &apos;s see how it looks on the floor , okay ?
okay , but i gotta be in a meeting in one hour .
ay , that &apos;s so cute that after six weeks ,
you think you &apos;re going to need an hour !
happy valentine &apos;s day !
it &apos;s the one time of the year
when the world tries to be as romantic as i am all the time .
good luck , world .
get out .
anyway , since you &apos;re almost done dressing jay ...
how about we head to school early ?
i &apos;ll check my hair and meet you in the car .
gloria , i &apos;ll be back in two hours , tops .
we decide who does what when you come back .
i got a ticket running a red light ...
so let &apos;s make this worth it . put the kid down .
i can &apos;t . he &apos;s being a real pritchett .
we need to come up with a different term for that .
watch .
watch .
okay , i used to have a tv got reception like that .
let me try . hey , joe joe . hey buddy .
guy to guy ,
you &apos;re blocking me a little bit . you know that .
yes , you do . yes , you do , joe .
hey , how about a half @-@ hour ? what do you say , pal ? huh ?
can you do it ?
attaboy !
i &apos;ve never been more attracted ... to you .
prove it .
are you kissing ?
that &apos;s a bit of a mood killer .
my daddies kiss a lot .
and flatlined .
mitch and cam are having a party for valentine &apos;s .
claire was supposed to take care of her ,
but now she can &apos;t .
lily , we &apos;re so happy to have you here .
i have a big surprise for you !
look ! a brand @-@ new , shiny tv remote !
looks complicated .
just keep hitting all those buttons until something good happens .
that &apos;s my plan , anyway .
where were all these distractions
the night that joe was conceived ?
i &apos;m kidding . he &apos;s a blessing .
can i help you ?
yeah , i &apos;m harlan . i &apos;m here to do your baby proofing .
jay , i &apos;ve been waiting for this appointment for weeks .
i &apos;ve waited longer for mine .
the human race has survived for a thousand years
without these foam bumpers and--and gates everywhere .
hell , i used to drive to the supermarket
with mitchell and claire on the hood of the car .
when did everybody get so overprotective ?
maybe when kids started flying off cars .
how long ?
normally i have help , but dale , uh ...
you met dale at the shop . he &apos;s a tall guy .
he &apos;s my sister &apos;s kid--
hey , listen .
you and i are gonna bang this out in about an hour .
where do you want it ?
i know a lot of people think that i &apos;m attracted to jay
because of his money , but they &apos;re wrong .
i &apos;m attracted to him because he &apos;s sexy ,
and he &apos;s never been sexier than today .
the suit ...
the carrying of the boxes ...
no , no . you listen to me .
you &apos;ve had my wife &apos;s car four days .
figure out what that screeching noise is ,
or you &apos;ll be making one yourself .
the yelling on the phone ...
give me that .
and the drilling .
so much drilling .
time to go , harlan .
okay . you want me to walk you through any of the--
no , we &apos;ll take it from here .
okay . uh , listen .
give me a call if you have any trouble with the gates ,
because they &apos;re a little tricky , you know ?
you gotta be gentle with it .
ten seconds , or i start without you .
ready or not , here i ...
come on !
okay , you have to lift it .
it &apos;s not a lift . it &apos;s a squeeze .
okay , then squeeze it !
i &apos;m squeezing it ! it &apos;s impossible !
jay , please .
best day ever !
i just got invited to a valentine &apos;s party by a secret admirer !
you should go .
sounds great ! go !
i obviously need to get dressed first .
can you keep it under a half @-@ hour ?
you &apos;re funny .
manny , come on . let &apos;s go !
relax .
you don &apos;t have to drive me . it &apos;s just down the street .
oh , i thought i ... had to drive you .
what &apos;s with the hat ?
my secret admirer requested
i wear a hat with a feather in it .
i &apos;m like , &quot; which one ? &quot;
really ?
this secret admirer have any other requests ?
uh , yes .
she asked me to bring some poetry to recite at the party .
these , uh , kids at the party ...
they wouldn &apos;t be the popular ones by any chance ?
the most popular . why ?
no reason . just ... have fun .
i will .
no , jay .
it &apos;s squeeze .
what ? i have cigar breath ?
it &apos;s not you .
ay . did you already ...
what ?
no !
no . i &apos;m worried about manny .
i think he &apos;s being set up for
some kind of humiliation at that party .
oh . that &apos;s so sweet of you to worry .
just when you thought that you couldn &apos;t get any sexier .
yeah , he &apos;s fine , right ?
yeah , he &apos;s fine .
come here ...
oh , i think i gotta check on him .
there was something about some kind of secret admirer
getting him to ...
bring his poems ?
yeah , he told me when i was lint @-@ rolling his jacket .
and you &apos;re not worried it &apos;s a prank ?
of course i worry .
i worry about him all the time .
but like you said ,
we can &apos;t protect them from everything .
so i &apos;m just trying to , like , let go a little bit .
let him ride on top of the car ?
no , that &apos;s just crazy .
that &apos;s the hardest part , isn &apos;t it ?
when you realize you can &apos;t stop the world from hurting them .
now you &apos;re making me want to cry .
this is not what this day is all about .
you &apos;re right .
okay .
i &apos;ll go and get us some champagne .
good idea .
manny ?
no , nothing .
just wanted to know if everything is okay .
hi , honey . sorry to bother you .
i know you &apos;re resting .
i heard you had a little scare last night .
hey , uh , when are you going back to the doctor ?
&apos;cause if you want , i can go with you .
this year for valentine &apos;s day ,
we decided to throw a lonely hearts party
for all of our single friends .
sometimes when we &apos;re around them ,
we feel a little guilty for having found each other ,
like we &apos;re waving our love in their faces .
there &apos;s gotta be a better way of saying that .
anyway , it was supposed to be an elegant affair .
ogle me .
showtime . put the cat away .
okay . yeah . great .
oh , and , mitchell , please ... hey .
yeah ?
please try to have fun tonight .
i always have fun .
no , i know you &apos;re great at stay @-@ at @-@ home fun
and sit @-@ on @-@ the @-@ couch fun ,
but this is party fun , and sometimes you--
okay , this is not fun .
get the door .
i will show you some fun .
things got a little hazy after that .
hello ?
yeah , hi--hi , dad .
no , no . i &apos;m up . i am up .
yeah , bring her by at any time .
okay . good night .
oh , cam .
oh , god , that was some party last night .
yeah . well , i &apos;m just glad you made it home safely .
wha--made--made it ho-- i don &apos;t--
i don &apos;t even remember leaving the party .
oh , i @-@ i think i got a little tipsy .
tipsy ?
you were like all of the &quot; mad men . &quot;
oh , no , no , no .
don &apos;t make it out like i did a lot of crazy , out of control--
i was hoping i dreamt that .
come on . like--like you &apos;ve never had a few cocktails
and died a cat pink with cherry kool @-@ aid .
okay . well , is there anything else you need to tell me about ?
not that i remember .
i &apos;m remembering this .
oh , my gosh , mitchell ,
are these burt and dottie winchell &apos;s
christmas decorations ? how could you ?
they never take them down , okay ?
i was doing the whole neighborhood a favor .
oh , god .
cam , i ... you know , i think-- i @-@ i think there are pictures .
i remember pepper and longinus were--okay .
oh , my gosh . those poor reindeer .
oh , it seems like prancer is the belle of the ball--
no surprise there .
oh . you must be vixen .
okay . okay . not funny , mitchell .
look at this place . what were you thinking ?
okay . cam , i ... yes , i went a little nuts , all right ?
i @-@ i &apos;m sorry .
but i didn &apos;t do anything that can &apos;t be undone .
hey , roomies .
hey , thank you so much for letting me move in here .
yes . could you excuse us for just a ...
a moment , dylan ?
yeah . take as much time as you need .
it &apos;s your house . i just live here now .
cam , did--did i tell him that he could live with us ?
obviously .
oh , my god .
was he even at our party ?
yes . he &apos;s been driving a limousine for some company ,
and j &apos;marcus hired him for the night ,
and now he lives here . are you all caught up there ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t remember any of this .
well , let &apos;s create a new memory--
one where you tell him he can &apos;t live here .
can i say one short thing ?
i came to this house a broken man
after my mom threw me out for her new boyfriend .
and then i found out
i was getting let go from the limo company
the same night haley goes to a party without me .
so i had nothing and no one .
and then you ...
okay . come on . tell him .
let him finish .
i &apos;m sorry .
i mean , gay dudes have always been nice to me--
i mean , super nice .
but nothing like this .
i guess what i &apos;m trying to say is ...
oh , my god . he &apos;s gonna sing .
* so many years living life underwater *
* came up for air in the room of your daughter *
* i never knew i would find my answer *
* in my ex @-@ girlfriend &apos;s uncles &apos; house *
* with the tiny pink panther *
dylan , dylan . i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry .
oh , gosh , i--this is ...
this is really hard for me to say ,
but we--we just cannot ...
not wash our cat .
i &apos;m sorry .
and yet when i did that drunk , not a scratch .
oh , my gosh , this place is cleaner than when we moved in .
best houseguest ever .
no , we are not keeping him .
do you think he took the christmas decorations back to the winchell &apos;s ?
oh , well , i think he thinks he did .
what ?
okay , yeah .
dylan !
dylan !
dylan !
no , no , no !
oh , hey , guys . i &apos;m up here .
yeah , hi . listen , dylan ,
those decorations were on the yard ...
of that house .
oh . no good deed , huh ?
hey ! i can see our house from here .
oh , jeez . are you kidding me ?
dylan ! dylan !
this day ...
one night . just till his bone sets .
but there &apos;s always gonna be a reason not to tell him ,
isn &apos;t there ?
okay . what if we , um--
no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no .
no &quot; we . &quot; you made your bed . you lie in it .
don &apos;t lie there . i just made it .
sorry .
not looking . not looking .
it &apos;s okay , dylan .
i made you guys some soups .
oh , dylan , you didn &apos;t have to do that .
well , cam didn &apos;t have to offer to let me stay here ,
but he did .
so here are soups .
cam offered ?
well , i know he was speaking for both of you .
you weren &apos;t home yet . is that a problem ?
not for me .
dylan , can you give us just a moment ?
not looking . not looking .
i &apos;ll get it !
so i guess in a way ,
we &apos;re both responsible .
yeah , but in the real way , you &apos;re responsible .
take care of that .
come on .
let &apos;s do it .
oh , my god . i hate myself right now .
what kind of monster
throws an injured innocent onto the street ?
you can &apos;t live here . get out !
lily .
lily .
it &apos;s weird . you &apos;re a big boy .
i &apos;m sorry , dylan .
she doesn &apos;t mean that .
no . she &apos;s right . everyone says it .
i need to stop running from conflict .
it &apos;s time to be a big boy and patch things up
and move back in with my mom .
i &apos;ll get my things .
okay . sorry .
sorry .
i guess i got off easy .
she is blunt but effective .
maybe we should have her talk to the gardener .
cam , um ...
do you really think that i &apos;m not any fun ?
what ?
last night , you said that i--
this isn &apos;t a hotel !
yeah , you made your point , honey !
he &apos;s got it .
no , it--i only drank like that last night
because i ... i was trying to be more fun .
oh . no , i didn &apos;t mean it like that .
i &apos;m sorry .
you know i have party anxiety . i was nervous .
no , but you &apos;re not entirely wrong .
i mean , i @-@ i could be a little ... less uptight
and loosen up a little bit .
yeah . maybe we could , you know ,
aim for middle @-@ ground fun .
you know , if--if you &apos;re up for a do @-@ over ,
i recently heard of an idea
that could put us in the low end
of upper middle @-@ ground fun .
okay .
do you believe in love at first sight ,
or should i walk in again ?
jay ?
coming , honey ! oh , god .
there you are , jay . i thought you &apos;d never wake up .
turns out my night with my secret admirer
couldn &apos;t have gone better .
we danced all night . and the best part was ,
her eyes were just ...
manny . manny , manny--
dying to hear it .
wait ten seconds and come in and tell both of us .
jay , you took so long .
i &apos;m not done with you .
i &apos;m not done with you , either .
best valentine &apos;s party ever .
so there &apos;s this girl--
i should start from the beginning .
all right .
so first a little history ...
