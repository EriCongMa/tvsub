is this a bad time ?
what are you doing here ?
my doctors released me .
the cops still don &apos;t know who killed garrett .
they can &apos;t even find the gun he was shot with .
why do you obsess about this stuff ?
does mona have something on you , lucas ?
did you do something ?
mona &apos;s up to something .
we need to bust into creepy &apos;s closet
and see what else he saved for her .
this isn &apos;t mona &apos;s . this is ali &apos;s .
did you ever ask your dad
about him meeting up with ali that night ?
garrett lied about a lot .
why are we suddenly gonna believe anything he said ?
how &apos;s meredith ?
did you and your friends do this to her ?
&quot; a &quot; set us up . that &apos;s why meredith opened that shed .
&quot; a &quot; sent her over there and made it look we did it .
you &apos;ve killed her .
i &apos;ve never seen a dead body before .
you killed her .
i think i &apos;ve seen this one before .
why don &apos;t you say something ?
why did you come back ?
listen , i wanted to talk to you about that explosion at school .
we &apos;ve already talked .
no , wait , you talked , i got accused .
meredith got a call from the principal .
he believes they found out who was behind it .
and i know that you are still upset at me
for thinking that you were somehow involved .
and i just wanted to say that i &apos;m sorry .
find you out .
this is why you &apos;ve come back .
i have seen this one .
that guy keeps a severed head in a hatbox .
i had to find you out .
now i have .
you &apos;ve come back here to be alone with me ,
same as you was there in the kitchen the other night , didn &apos;t you ?
either there &apos;s something in that journal
that explains why aria &apos;s dad would meet up with ali
the night she died , or we have to believe garrett &apos;s story .
we couldn &apos;t do this at lunch tomorrow ?
do you wanna run into harold and his rusty bolt cutter again ?
the school basement is creepy at night .
how does this prove anything garrett says ?
he was in ali &apos;s room that night .
maybe he just made that stuff up from reading her journal .
why ? to stop us from thinking he did it ?
garrett was shot because he talked .
kinda makes me believe he was telling the truth .
i really hope it &apos;s not true about aria &apos;s dad .
i have enough daddy issues of my own .
i can &apos;t deal with having issues about hers , too .
all right , you guys just go in . i &apos;ll keep watch .
you hit the switch .
i can &apos;t find it .
there &apos;s somebody in here .
hanna , look out !
did you see anything ?
i didn &apos;t get a good look .
guys .
where &apos;s all of harold &apos;s stuff ?
it &apos;s like he was never here .
look , there &apos;s ali &apos;s journal .
come on , let &apos;s go .
no , wait .
soy ?
unsweetened , no foam .
you deserve a medal .
you guys , i tossed and turned all night .
i &apos;d wake up from a dream about keeping secrets from ezra ,
and then i &apos;d fall asleep and
i would dream about falsely accusing my dad .
weirdly , both of them ended with my teeth falling out .
anxiety dreams .
in mine , usually there &apos;s always a piece of gum in my hair ,
and i just keep pulling and pulling until i &apos;m bald .
academic decathlon .
i show up to state finals
with my underwear on the outside .
are you still gunning for team captain ?
didn &apos;t you hear ?
brad langfield got into a bike accident .
he &apos;s gonna need physical therapy .
the very grim upside is that i &apos;m running unopposed .
are you the only one of us that got sleep ?
are you kidding ? after last night ?
so everything &apos;s gone ?
everything but a fake diary .
we &apos;ve gotta talk to my mom about where my dad was that night .
my teeth actually feel kinda loose right now .
hey , ladies . losing sleep ?
me , too .
what exactly are you talking about ?
remember that creepy harold guy ,
from the lost woods motel ?
what about him ?
he was at our school , stalking me .
he bribed the real custodian so he could have the job .
why would he be stalking you ?
i used to talk to him once in a while ,
and he sort of ran with it .
when i told him it was inappropriate ,
he didn &apos;t take it so well .
and after what happened at the 10k ,
i told my parents ,
and we went to the school administration .
you think that he rigged
that explosion in the shed just to hurt you ?
i guess the police are looking for him now ,
but harold &apos;s gone completely off the grid .
i really hope they find him soon .
you sure it was him ?
who else would it be ?
anyway , i just thought you guys should know .
okay , please tell me no one else bought that .
i &apos;m just glad it &apos;s over with .
meredith thought that we did that .
so mona did us a favor . we did not ask for it .
we definitely don &apos;t owe her anything .
i wouldn &apos;t call anything that mona does a favor .
you know her better than any of us , hanna .
what do you think ?
i think there &apos;s more to the story .
lucas , can i talk to you for a minute ?
not now , hanna .
look , i know it was you last night in the basement .
i &apos;m not gonna tell anyone .
i just ... why were you there ?
i was looking for something .
listen , we shouldn &apos;t be seen together .
by who ?
who do you think ?
listen , if you wanna take the chance ,
and believe that mona is cured ,
go ahead , drink the kool @-@ aid .
no one is sipping her cuckoo juice .
i &apos;ve seen you talk to her .
so what if i talk to her ? i know better than to trust her .
lucas , why are you so freaked out ?
the question is , why aren &apos;t you ?
have you tried stopping her ?
i couldn &apos;t .
what do you mean , stop her ?
lucas , you didn &apos;t ...
you almost blew up a teacher .
i just wanted to scare her . i didn &apos;t want to hurt anybody .
so get a restraining order or a can of mace .
i should go .
no , look .
if you need help , let me help you .
you can &apos;t .
just promise me you won &apos;t try another stunt like that again .
i had to do something .
as long as mona is back here ,
we &apos;re not safe .
paige .
i have to get straight home . text you later ?
can you walk me to work , at least ?
you know how it &apos;s been since halloween .
my parents are just being cautious .
if i &apos;m even a little late , i get blasted .
tell me about it .
my dad almost made me quit my job .
you know why he &apos;s doing that , right ?
things have happened to you .
and to you .
yeah , i get that he wants
to keep me safe because of what happened ,
but i wanna keep moving forward .
how can you not think about what we went through ?
i &apos;ll never forget .
but looking back for me ended in that lighthouse .
we &apos;ve both been cooped up .
some of the girls from the swim team
are having a party in the woods .
don &apos;t you have a curfew ?
yeah . we &apos;ll go on the early side
so i can get back on time .
i think it &apos;ll do both of us some good .
you in ?
yeah , i &apos;m in .
cool . i &apos;ll text them and let them know we &apos;re coming .
okay .
they were all out of the times ,
but i got you lots of copies of the observer .
thank you for helping my freshmen to remember
that tmz is not the only source for current events .
if i think about this too much ,
雷诺兹一家要求重新调查案件
it makes me want to run out
in the middle of the street and scream .
why , &apos; cause of what happened to garrett ?
no . that in the middle of all this ,
people are forgetting that a young girl was killed .
yeah , and we still don &apos;t know who did it or why .
i &apos;ve actually been thinking
about what happened the night ali went missing . a lot .
you and dad , you went to a barbecue , right ?
after you dropped me off at spencer &apos;s .
yeah , it was some stuffy hollis thing
at the chancellor &apos;s with cocktail wieners
and sliders and fancy dipping sauces .
you needed us that next morning ,
and we slept in , your father and i.
i don &apos;t think we or i ever apologized for that .
mom , it &apos;s okay .
no , it &apos;s not .
but it &apos;s one of those moments as a parent
you wish you could do over again .
we thought we had a night off from the kids .
a night off from the kids , huh ?
so you were out pretty late .
no .
we left early .
i snuck a bottle of wine home in my purse .
i thought we &apos;d save it ,
but your father opened it as soon as we got home .
we sat on the porch .
it was lovely , warm .
i remember .
till the storm rolled in .
i &apos;m pretty sure we were dead to the world before that .
one too many glasses of red ,
and i can sleep through a stampede .
and we slept through your first call that morning .
it &apos;s so weird to think back to that night .
you were at a party with your friends .
i let byron pour that extra glass of wine ,
and we were all just enjoying ourselves
while something ... terrible was happening .
brad &apos;s parents said he should be able
to whisper in a week or so .
guess he hit his trachea on the handlebars .
they figured out what happened ?
his front wheel fell off .
i guess there was a faulty nut .
wow .
should we move on to new business ?
first things first .
we have to welcome a new member .
mona vanderwall will be joining us .
wait , what ?
word came down from the faculty advisor this afternoon .
joining in school activities is part of her recovery .
i guess she has a note from her doctor .
you guys have history .
that &apos;s rough .
yeah , if you &apos;re downplaying it .
hey , sorry i &apos;m late .
i had to get some signatures and a copy of my transcripts ,
and ... oh , and this .
okay , second item . team captain .
running for position , spencer hastings ...
and mona vanderwall .
now that &apos;s rough .
okay , why ?
i played dumb for a really long time , spencer .
i &apos;m not gonna do that anymore .
this is a chance to show people who i really am .
i see . and when did you even--
i kept up with my schoolwork while i was ... away ,
and i memorized the study guide ...
last night .
all right .
andrew , as secretary , you call the vote , right ?
right .
all those in favor of mona as team captain .
i had some time to campaign .
and spencer ?
a tie . unbelievable .
so i guess we have a quiz @-@ off .
back of the study guide in the by @-@ laws .
you read the by @-@ laws .
of course .
tomorrow then .
good luck .
andrew , anything else ?
no . meeting adjourned .
thank you .
thank you .
hi , i &apos;m mona .
thanks .
that was out of left field .
come on . don &apos;t tell me you didn &apos;t enjoy that .
honestly , i didn &apos;t .
look , i know why you want this ;
yale will be impressed .
but when it comes to mona ...
what she wants is anyone &apos;s guess .
nobody asked mona to play .
so ... put on your hastings face
and spank her tomorrow night like i know you can .
good pep talk .
maybe her phone was hidden or something .
if she &apos;s gonna dip bag into
the &quot; a &quot; bag to scare me off the decathlon team ,
she &apos;s got another think coming .
is being captain brainiac really that important ?
do you know something we don &apos;t ?
no . i &apos;m just saying ,
if mona &apos;s back to her old tricks ,
then maybe we should stay away from her .
like sabotaging brad so she could run against me
for team captain ? that &apos;s so ...
... ali .
she &apos;s coming over here .
hi , spencer .
listen , i just wanted to thank you
for being such a good sport .
i know that the two of us running for the same position
could have caused some tension .
- i didn &apos;t mean to make a big deal of that .
i would &apos;ve called or texted , but ...
oh , no , mona , i got your text .
yesterday .
i &apos;m not allowed to have a cell phone .
no texting , no internet .
part of my release terms from radley .
no internet . so how did you post that apology video ?
the vice @-@ principal
said that i could have limited access to the computer lab .
homework only , supervised .
that was certainly calculating , but i wouldn &apos;t call it trig .
i thought it was the right thing to do , so i asked jason and ...
he &apos;s helping you ?
he supervised .
it was my idea .
we know you were sneaking out of radley , mona .
how are we supposed to believe anything you say ?
mona ?
the doctor said that
people might have some trouble .
it &apos;s just been a little more overwhelming than i thought , you know ,
to confront the past and
work it out with all of you .
will you excuse me ?
that was part of her act , right ?
yeah , let &apos;s go .
it &apos;s my week to monitor detention , so ...
i just need a minute .
i saw you and aria talking yesterday after school .
looked pretty intense .
just mother @-@ daughter stuff .
i assume it was about this .
i just want you to know that i won &apos;t be pursuing things .
because the person who did that to you was identified .
i jumped to a conclusion .
aria and i haven &apos;t had the easiest time .
and i hope i haven &apos;t made things harder for us .
i &apos;m seeing someone now , and byron has moved on .
i &apos;m sure that we can keep things professional .
i would like that if we could .
i have to monitor detention .
spencer says jason checks out .
apparently , he was working with mona ,
but just her internet nanny .
great . we still don &apos;t know who &apos;s helping mona .
i talked to my mom yesterday .
you look a little green .
yeah , i &apos;ve been feeling queasy .
i think the stress is just getting to me .
what did she say ?
as far as my mom knows , my dad was with her the whole night .
but she slept through that storm .
she could &apos;ve easily slept through him sneaking out of the house .
he knows how she gets after a couple of glasses of wine .
i just don &apos;t wanna believe that it was intentional .
so you &apos;re saying he wanted her to sleep through the night ?
but it still doesn &apos;t mean that he snuck out to meet alison .
maybe he met up with meredith .
were they still together then ?
no , they weren &apos;t seeing each other .
that &apos;s what he told me .
in the journal entry , he said he promised to meet alison
when she came back from her grandmother &apos;s .
at was the same night she died .
maybe he agreed to meet her at a different time .
no , he didn &apos;t . it said that--
i &apos;ll show you .
guys , the pages aren &apos;t in here .
check the other boot .
no , i put it in the left one .
you &apos;re sure it &apos;s this one ?
yes .
that &apos;s quite a mess you &apos;re making .
did you lose something ?
no . yeah .
we &apos;re just looking for the other one of these .
oh , here it is .
crisis averted .
um , i thought that you had a meeting tonight .
i canceled it . i have to pack for a conference .
i have a colleague who had an emergency .
i &apos;m filling in .
okay .
remember when mike used to raid your halloween candy ?
you always used to stash it in your snow boots .
he never thought to look there .
i always thought that was pretty clever .
well , i &apos;ll get out of your hair .
he knows .
tajikistan , turkmenistan ,
ukraine , and uzbekistan .
alphabetical order . you are good ..
okay , toss me some hard stuff .
we haven &apos;t touched anything from earth sciences .
i made these flash cards
for the periodic tables that i wanna go over .
have you seen those ?
i can come with you ,
and i can rub your shoulders between rounds ,
and wrap your knuckles ,
and hold your spit bucket .
this is not a prize fight ,
but i would like to punch her .
spencer ...
no , i would love for you to be there ,
but don &apos;t you have dinner with your boss ?
i can cancel .
i &apos;ve got this , okay ? and thanks to you ,
i &apos;m gonna wipe the floor with her .
you know , this isn &apos;t about looking good
on college applications anymore .
there are 42 clubs at rosewood high .
mona could &apos;ve picked any one of them .
she &apos;s baiting me .
and the only way to stop her is to beat her , fair and square .
i don &apos;t have time for flash cards anymore .
i have to get changed , and you &apos;re gonna be late for dinner .
my boss .
okay .
hey . sure , no problem .
i &apos;ll stop on the way .
good luck .
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m just leaving right now .
hey , your mom let me up .
can i talk to you for a minute ?
look , um ...
i know you warned me about mona ,
but we kind of poked the bear today ,
and i just wanna make sure she didn &apos;t take it out on you .
mona &apos;s not my problem anymore .
i &apos;m leaving rosewood high for good .
she can &apos;t get to me if i &apos;m home @-@ schooled .
so she was blackmailing you .
try still blackmailing .
for how long ?
since the masquerade ball . i got an anonymous text
to go to go distract jenna .
and then , after that ,
she was in radley , she got in contact again .
i picked up an envelope from jason dilaurentis .
and brought it to her .
then when i told her that i was out ,
that i was done ,
she tried to run me over .
oh , my god .
lucas , are you okay ?
this s.u.v. just swerved at me out of nowhere .
i didn &apos;t see the driver , but it had to be mona .
so when you were doing things for her ,
did you ever meet with anyone else ?
as far as i could tell , i was just the middleman .
she &apos;s completely protected .
it &apos;s just easier if i bow out of school .
maybe that way , i can protect myself .
why would you want to protect yourself from school ?
what does she have on you ?
test answers ,
to every course the school offers .
i was selling them .
to who ?
anyone with cash .
after she tried to make me road kill ,
i shut everything down and covered my tracks .
now i just have to disappear .
why don &apos;t you tell me what you were doing in her room ?
i don &apos;t know why you just won &apos;t tell me .
why would you question ?
it &apos;s my house , it &apos;s my daughter .
you &apos;re gonna walk away in the middle of this ?
i can &apos;t even look at you right now .
meredith , listen . listen .
i will not let you run away from me .
byron , my arm .
look , i didn &apos;t mean-- - dad ?
what &apos;s going on ?
everything &apos;s fine , aria .
are we even close ?
what does it say on the g.p.s. ?
a few more miles , then we &apos;re gonna make a left .
that &apos;s really far out of town .
paige , are you okay ?
i just need to pull over for a sec .
paige .
are you okay ?
i couldn &apos;t breathe .
hey ...
don &apos;t .
i &apos;m sorry . i just can &apos;t go , okay ?
hey , that &apos;s fine . it &apos;s just a party .
it &apos;s not just a party !
i can &apos;t do anything since halloween .
i &apos;ve been able to hide from you
because your parents are protective .
i told you i had a restriction , too . i don &apos;t .
i can barely leave my house to go to school .
why didn &apos;t you tell me any of this ?
because i didn &apos;t want you to know .
you like strong women , right ?
after nate was gone , i thought everything would be okay again .
and then , garrett died .
and now , all i can think about
is when the next bad thing is gonna happen .
i know you &apos;re scared .
i &apos;m scared .
and now , i &apos;ve ruined your night .
no , you haven &apos;t ruined anything .
why don &apos;t we go for a little walk .
okay ? get some air . okay ?
it &apos;s terrible , what kind of person ...
oh , hey .
i bought a &quot; get well soon &quot; card for brad . did you wanna sign ?
the whole team already sent him flowers , so ...
i know , but there &apos;s no such thing as too much encouragement
when you &apos;re on the mend .
three rounds . most correct answers wins .
you &apos;ve got ten seconds after you ring the bell .
i &apos;ll read the questions .
sam and conrad will keep time and score .

next question .
i followed you .
you were really upset , and my da--
my dad , i have never seen him that angry before .
is there something going on , something that i should know about ?
you can sit down , you know .
did you hear ?
some of it .
it sounded like you caught my dad in my room .
do you know what he was doing ?
rifling through papers .
that wasn &apos;t the first time i caught him .
he was going through my purse yesterday .
what ? did he say why ?
he thought it was yours .
when i came across him in your room ,
i asked him what was going on .
he wouldn &apos;t tell me .
he seemed ... caught .
defensive .
i couldn &apos;t shake the feeling that he was lying .
so later , he went to drop mike off at a friend &apos;s .
and i went on my own search .
i found these ...
in his dresser .
those are mine . did you read this ?
do you know what these mean ?
i knew what was going on back then .
your friend alison , blackmail .
that doesn &apos;t make sense . you weren &apos;t together then .
aria , he came to see me ...
the night she disappeared .
he was with my mother the entire night .
did he tell you that ?
why would he come to you ?
he thought i had something to do with it .
he still believed i destroyed his office ,
and figured somehow , i was ...
pushing her to ask for more money .
was he with you the entire night ?
he left my apartment to go meet her .
i tried to change his mind .
i begged him .
the next day , she was missing .
i &apos;m pretty sure it &apos;s the maxilla and mandible .
operation petticoat . no , wait ...

i just need to get a few things .
i &apos;d like to talk .
okay .
listen , about earlier , i &apos;m sorry .
i didn &apos;t mean to scare you .
tough loss .
we can still shut this down .

after everything , they &apos;ll have to hear you out .
would you wanna win that way ?
hey , i just got your text . you okay ?

no , he &apos;s still out at dinner with his boss .
okay , we &apos;ll go .
okay . thank you .
in one second .
what are you doing ?
just hang on .
mona , can i talk to you for a minute ?
sure . oh , there &apos;s still more cupcakes if you wanna join .
i &apos;m on to you .
okay , nothing &apos;s changed .
you are still pulling strings and pushing buttons .
manipulating lives , using people &apos;s secrets .
i wasted months visiting you ,
defending you , feeling guilty for everything you did to me .
and i kept thinking , maybe if i was a better friend .
you almost reeled me in .
&quot; i &apos;m scared , hanna . i need you . &quot; bull crap .
i know you &apos;re still &quot; a , &quot; and i know what you &apos;re doing to lucas .
whatever lucas said--
no , i &apos;m done .
i don &apos;t wanna see you , i don &apos;t wanna hear from you ,
and i don &apos;t wanna know you .
i &apos;m sorry you feel that way .
we have a competition in , like , a month .
overnight travel .
i &apos;m not gonna be able to survive a weekend with mona .
maybe we should throw her under a bus , literally .
here &apos;s more ice .
this isn &apos;t working .
i &apos;d actually need to remove my brain ,
and soak it in an ice bath .
&quot; cut mona off ? big mistake .
you &apos;re not the only one who can slice and dice . a. &quot;
it &apos;s not lucas ?
100 % not lucas .
mona just used him like an evil personal assistant .
i think there &apos;s more people out there who are way worse .
you shouldn &apos;t have yelled at her like that .
spence , she had it coming .
i know , but if she &apos;s up to her old tricks ,
that text won &apos;t be the end of it .
so what ? we know her tricks .
i &apos;m not gonna live my life in fear .
mona can &apos;t hide from us anymore .
do you remember when she started to unravel the other day
in the courtyard ?
i saw her crack like that tonight .
i thought i could rattle her cage and send her running .
that &apos;s what made me lose .
how ?
&apos;cause i got cocky ,
and competitive .
i saw this soft underbelly , and i lunged .
so you think she showed you a weak spot on purpose ?
that &apos;s what i &apos;m worried about .
she doesn &apos;t have to hide behind &quot; a &quot; anymore .
she can take us on right in the open .
did your parents say it was okay ?
i told them i was sleeping downstairs on the couch .
my dad &apos;s gonna call the auto club in the morning .
maybe by then , we &apos;ll have an excuse for why the tire was slashed .
i feel like this is all my fault .
i told you about &quot; a. &quot;
it makes sense that you &apos;re worried all the time .
panicked .
em , i don &apos;t blame you .
i just wonder how you can do it .
you chased somebody through the woods tonight .
you refuse to be scared , even after everything that &apos;s happened .
i still get scared .
mostly , i get angry .
i don &apos;t deserve to live like this .
neither do you .
i &apos;m sorry .
don &apos;t be .
i feel safer with you here .
paige , i think that maybe you should see somebody .
just promise me you &apos;ll at least think about it .
promise .
okay . get some sleep .
where is he ?
your father went to campus for a little while .
he had some work to get done .
feeling any better ?
no . um , i thought it was all the stuff with my dad
that was tying me up in knots .
now i think i have the actual flu . yay .
it &apos;s my powerhouse potion . all herbal .
i make a big pot at the first sign of anything .
trust me , it works wonders .
i don &apos;t think byron knows we have those pages .
so if you want , i can take them--
no , don &apos;t worry . i hid them .
is there any way this was some horrible accident ?
your father would never intentionally hurt that girl ...
would he ?
well , he &apos;ll be gone for a few days ,
so that gives us time to figure it out .
meredith , he &apos;s my dad , and i obviously love him ,
but you don &apos;t think that we should keep this a secret , do you ?
we both love byron .
whatever happens next , it &apos;s gonna be tough , aria .
get some sleep .
meredith .
thanks .
for the tea .
he &apos;s leaving . i &apos;ll call you back .
