They say love knows no bounds.
I don't know about that.
I feel like I've seen the bounds
and pushed them a couple of times.
It's gonna rain.
It's not gonna rain.
Told her to have the reception indoors.
This wedding is doomed even if it happens
because it's definitely going to rain.
You want it to rain. You are willing it to rain.
I am not willing it to rain.
She's just so full of feelings all the time.
Why can't she just cram them down
and shut up like everybody else?
You can't expect her to be Cristina.
Exactly my point.
She's definitely not Cristina.
That's what I mean.
Owen wants this? Owen's marrying this?
He said yes when she asked.
Jo still hasn't given you a reason?
I don't need a reason.
She doesn't want to marry me. I'm done. It's over.
Maybe it's nobody's fault.
Maybe you only get one.
One what?
Soul mate? Or true love?
Well, then, who...
Izzie?
Alex, Izzie wasn't your one true love.
And even if she was --
What was Derek?
Are you telling me that you think
that's coming around again?
That was different.
How?
Love definitely has bounds.
I've seen where it ends.
I told you it was gonna rain.
This wedding is doomed.
Mom. Mom! Mother!
I know I was engaged before. I was there.
No.
I am sober.
Because we love each other.
Because we didn't see a reason to wait.
Because people get hit by cars.
We've been together for a year.
Yes, we broke up, and then we...
So what if it has been off and on?
Oh, hey, don't let me forget the rings, and I called the --
What?
I don't know, Mom...
Amelia's mom.
No one in the family is coming to the wedding.
...ex-daughter-in-law
What?
and ask her permission to live my life.
Because I do.
I'm alone.
If you don't come, it is just me. Mom.
Mommy, please, I am getting married.
Fine. Yeah, no.
Um...okay. I understand.
Yeah, it's so good to know that all of the best people
in this family are dead.
Amelia, hey.
Rain is supposed to be good luck.
Okay.
Hey, uh, do you want to go over there together?
Go over where?
To the wedding.
Do you want to drive over together, or --
Well, at this point, I don't even know if I'm going.
Trauma's strapped for surgeons and residents.
Blake is gone. Wilson's off.
You could always put me back in.
Don't.
Yeah, I know, I know.
Still, if you're shorthanded, mm, just makes sense.
Ugh, good lord.
You're just like Tuck.
I tell you no -- - you keep pushing and pushing
like it's gonna change my mind.
You don't think four months is long enough
for me to learn my lesson?
On a six-month suspension? No, I don't.
If you think a scheduling glitch
will suddenly make me trust you again in an O.R. --
Wait. "Trust me"?
What do you mean "Trust me"?
No, no. I get that you needed to discipline me,
but you don't trust me with patients?
It was a grave error in judgment.
And you're gonna trust me again in two more months?
That's what it will take?
Miranda, should I be here at all?
I'll see you at the wedding.
I don't feel good about how quiet it is in there.
She's fine.
You have no idea how many people have locked themselves
in that bathroom.
They're always fine.
I am serious, Mer. I'm worried about her.
This is her wedding day.
It's supposed to be the happiest day of her life,
the -- the magic day, the love day.
Amelia, we're here for you, okay?
As long as it takes.
20 more minutes
and I'm ripping the door off the hinges!
Amelia, stuff your feelings in!
What? It's not my love day. I have things to do.
Okay. Where is she?
Oh, thank God.
Amelia, open the door.
Amelia?
It doesn't matter.
If they don't want to be here, then...
they shouldn't be.
We don't want them.
They don't get it, and they don't have to.
I do.
And I'll be there.
And the only one I want there is you.
You're not supposed to see me before the wedding.
It's bad luck.
I'll close my eyes. I won't see a thing.
Come out, Amelia.
Come out and marry me.
Okay.
Go. I will see you at the church.
I am an excellent best man.
40-something male --
multiple stab wounds to the abdomen and arm.
He broke into an elderly woman's apartment and attacked her.
Oh, for God's sake.
And the lady fought the bastard off with a carving knife.
Damn, Gram!
...being controlled by an inflated pressure cuff.
Vitals are holding so far.
Aah! I was boiling an egg.
He scared me near to death.
I bet.
Must've come in through the -- through the window.
Came up behind me in my kitchen.
So I just
Pressure on that, Cross.
I'm trying.
Oh, here, I got it.
Is she -- Is she okay?
How about you don't talk about her?
Yeah, you picked the wrong grandma today, bud.
She's my mother.
I take care of her.
She has dementia.
She didn't know it was me.
She didn't know.
We'll need to get you some X-rays.
Can you move your thumb for me?
Where were you?
I'm sorry?
You left me all alone,
and I had to -- You should've been there.
You should've been there for me, should've taken care of me.
Louise, do you know where you are?
That's... what a husband does.
Okay.
Don't -- Don't -- Don't leave me.
Don't leave. Don't leave me.
Oh, okay, all right.
Don't leave me again.
Please. Please.
Okay.
Let's make a baby.
What?
You said that you wanted a baby,
and you would make an amazing dad.
And that's what you're worried about, right --
that I'm not all in? But I am.
And I love you.
Are you gonna tell me why you won't marry me?
I told you that I love you...
and that I'm not going anywhere.
So isn't that enough? Can't that be enough for you?
You know, I was with Mer this morning,
and I was thinking, the two of us,
we've been through hell.
You know, all kinds of drama --
crazy family stuff, we both almost died,
losing people we love.
No, y-you're not losing me.
The point is, we grew up.
Mer and I are grown up.
We got through it.
And hell is behind me.
It's in my rearview mirror, and I'm not going back.
I'm done.
I'm not -- I'm not - some idiot kid anymore, Jo.
I'm a man, and I'm done with games.
I'm done with with crazy. I'm done with losing.
I'm done with drama.
I don't care about your secrets
and your excuses and your drama.
You know, I-I've had that.
Alex, if we could just --
I just said I don't want to do this!
I -- I have never had one second
of anything real my entire life.
I want truth.
I want -- I want a wife and a house and a family!
Amelia and, uh, Owen's wedding today -- I want that!
本季终
Surprised to see you here.
I work here.
Well, I just figured - you'd be at the wedding by now.
So, um...do you have some time
before you have to be at the church?
Don't do that.
Do what?
Get any ideas.
Don't get any ideas.
There are no ideas here for you.
I don't have any ideas, okay?
This is -- I'm just making small talk.
Okay, well, don't do that.
Why not?
Because I'm busy. I'm working.
Okay.
I'm busy.
I'm working, too.
I'm not trying to be mean.
I just -- I don't want you to get too attached.
I have three children, a big job.
Okay, you jumped me.
Okay, not that I minded.
It was good.
We had a good time.
It was very good.
I don't know about you,
but that was some of my best work.
And in a car, which is not easy.
But now what?
Now you think, what, you're my sun and my moon,
that all of a sudden
I think that the stars shine down on only you,
that you touched me and the heavens opened
and I -- I'm blinded by the angel that is you?
I mean, you're good, but nobody's that good.
I did jump you, didn't I?
Yeah. You did.
Okay, well, point taken. You are not after me.
I'm not after you.
We are friends
who maybe have sex.
We're friends who had sex once.
Uh, we are friends that had sex four times in one night,
but let's not get picky.
Okay, yeah. So the tux is here, shoes there.
Um, is there anything else you need?
I'll be fine.
You're good?
And did you remember black socks?
Ha, I knew it.
You know, thank God for you.
This is why I had you hold on to the rings.
Thank God for me.
Hey, am I the first one here?
Do you have a car?
Why?
Do you have a car?!
Yes. Why?
Okay.
Ugh, damn it.
Uh, Amelia's next door.
You can go through there if you want.
Here.
Thanks.
Big day today.
Big step.
Really big step.
Meredith, why do you have a problem
with me marrying your sister?
I don't, but I'm responsible.
I mean, he left her to me, and she left you to me.
I'm not a piece of property
for Cristina to just hand over for safekeeping.
I haven't told her. Does she know?
No.
Don't you think you should call her
and tell her before you do this?
Why would I do that?
She was the love of your life.
If it were me, I would call Derek --
I don't know --
just to see if it came close to what we had.
Okay, look up for me.
Amelia.
This is your love day.
It is a happy day.
It's so happy.
I'm happy.
Amelia.
Nothing.
Derek was supposed to walk me down the aisle.
My dad's gone, and he's always --
He walked every one of my sisters down the aisle.
Well, I'm here, and Meredith will be here any minute,
and we will all be together.
I left the rings...
I don't remember where I left the rings.
Well, uh, they say if you think out loud
while you're looking for something, you find it faster.
Who says?
Scientists... who lose things.
Okay. Okay. All right.
I remember there was one point that I went upstairs.
You okay?
Yep. I'm fine.
Uh, I went upstairs, - and Amelia was in the bathroom.
And -- Okay.
I'm here. Sorry I'm late.
I had two patients I had to discharge,
and Owen just had cuff-link issues.
Are you okay?
Amelia?
You should probably go.
Where's Maggie?
She's checking on the weather.
It's raining. Didn't you notice?
What's wrong? What's happening?
What can I do?
What can you do?
What can you do?
What -- That -- That is amazing.
That is an amazing question.
What can you do?
Amelia.
Meredith, I am flipping out here.
I'm wearing a wedding gown.
There is a good and decent man in there
who loves me and is expecting to marry me,
and I can't tell if I am marrying because I love him back
or because I just ran here and picked up a scalpel
and slipped into this Shepherd skin.
And maybe it is right, and maybe it's not,
but I don't know,
and I am marrying Cristina's husband.
I know what you think about that.
And I don't know what I'm doing.
And there is no one here with me.
There is no one here to tell me to quit
or get me down the aisle or j-- help me.
That is Derek's job, and Derek is dead.
And all I have is Maggie,
and Maggie is full of sunshine and candy and hope,
and every time I try to tell her that the world is on fire,
she hands me a marshmallow to roast,
so that just leaves you.
And you -- you are rooting for the other guy.
You told me to go and be with Owen,
and then you turned on me,
and now you are not on my side.
And we both know you don't like me,
but you are stuck with me.
So here I am in a wedding gown
on the happiest fricking day of my life
in a room with no family and no help
and no one on my side but you.
So what can you do for me?
What can you do for me, Meredith?
You're me.
What?
You're me before Derek.
I can be here for you.
I know how to do this.
I can be a trusted sister for you.
Just how do you want to play this?
Do you need me to tell you you're a beautiful bride
and kick your ass down that aisle?
You're a beautiful bride.
Turn around. I'll start kicking.
Do you need me to call your mother and yell at her?
I'm your girl.
If you need a shoulder to cry on, I have two.
If you want to freak out and call it off,
if you want to run, - I'll drive the getaway car.
Just let me know what you need.
I'm here for you.
I am your family, Amelia.
Today, I am your person.
Just tell me what you want to do.
What are you doing?
We're running.
Where are we running?
Doesn't matter. Let's go!
Oh, God. So many people. All those people!
Okay, stop it.
And the food! Oh, my -- All that food.
Stop. Don't do that.
The food doesn't matter.
Amelia's what matters.
Right. Okay. What happened?
Nothing happened.
What's wrong with Owen?
Nothing's wrong with Owen.
Well, he could use some sun.
There's nothing wrong with Owen.
Then why are we doing this?
Okay, so then I hung up the phone,
and I went over to the table and
What? Wha-- W-What?
You -- You okay?
Found it.
All right, look. Let's get out of here.
Okay.
Okay, you-- you're having contractions.
No. Braxton-Hicks all day.
Ben, I'm fine. I'm fine.
Go on. Sit down.
Come on. No.
We got to get these rings over to Owen, and I'm gonna --
Kep-- Kepner -- Kepner, have a seat.
Oh, boy.
Okay, sitting sounds good.
Okay. -It's good.
So, I will repair this tendon right here
and get you sewn right up.
I didn't know you could do that.
Are you a doctor?
I am.
I'm confused.
That's okay.
Um, Louise, do you remember your son at all?
Donnie?
Son? Son? I...
I don't -- I don't have any children.
Okay.
Well, a-actually, you do.
I'm having a baby?
We're having a baby?
No, that's -- that is not what I meant.
We're having a baby.
I can't wait.
Uh, me neither.
Congratulations.
You're dismissed, Doctor.
All right. -
Avery's with the mom, so I'll let him know
her son pulled through.
Page me when he wakes up.
How was she in there?
Sh-- Uh, she's fine.
Bailey, she's not fine.
Sofia keeps asking me why Mom's so sad,
and she wouldn't even go to Owen's wedding.
I feel like I should do something.
Robbins, there's nothing you can do.
This isn't your business anymore.
I -- - Now, look, she lost her child.
The woman she loved moved across the country.
So, no, she's not okay.
The only thing you can do is get okay with it yourself.
It's over. I had the love of my life,
and I just -- pssh -- pushed him away, and now he's gone.
I lost him.
Let's not overstate this.
He's just living at Meredith's.
Steph, you didn't see his face.
He's gone.
Oh, God. I'm sorry.
It's fine.
I'm sorry.
He's not gone-gone.
Kyle is gone-gone.
Making it worse.
Hey, can I get a cheeseburger,
rings to go please? Thanks.
Uh, hey, DeLuca, are you working?
Ugh, I just got off an 18-hour shift.
I've been dreaming of this cheeseburger and my bed.
Wilson's your patient now.
I'm gonna go home.
What?
Make sure that she doesn't drive or fall in a toilet
or go anywhere near them.
No, Dr. Edwards. Please.
You don't have to stay. I'm fine.
Hey, could I get that for here?
Sure.
So, they're just gone? All three of them?
Yeah, it would appear so, yeah.
And they didn't say anything?
They did not.
Now, l-l-let's just stay calm.
I'm calm. I'm sure there's a good reason.
They'll be back soon.
Absolutely.
Hey, could you ask Kepner to come here for a moment?
Right.
it seems we've lost Kepner, too.
Wha--?
Okay. Okay.
See, that -- that one came a lot faster.
They're -- They're -- They're a lot closer together now.
Maybe we should take this party on to the hospital.
Wait, wait, wait, w-wait, wait, Ben.
Wait, wait, wait.
I don't -- I don't want to have this baby in your car.
Neither do I. - We're going to the hospital.
No. No, No. Hey.
Okay, but figure my contractions are close together
plus traffic plus the rain
plus, uh -- I don't know --
a tree in the road?
What, you're saying that you
I'm saying that between your car and this house
with heat, running water, blankets,
um, I'll stay here. Yeah.
I'm gonna have this baby right here.
April, no.
Ben, come on.
It's having a baby at home.
People have done it in caves.
My mom did it once in a barn, I think.
We can do this.
We should just get in the car.
It's -- Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
But you know what? I'm gon I'm gonna call an ambulance, though.
Get us some help.
Okay.
I'm gonna have a baby.
You're gonna have a baby.
On Meredith's rug.
Right on Meredith's rug.
Is it happening? Am I having the baby now?
Okay, you need to relax.
Oh, I wish you could stay.
I'm gonna stay right here by your side the entire time.
When you wake up, I'm gonna be right here.
Oh, you promise?
I love you.
I love you.
Okay.
So weird.
No one say anything, please.
Warren has called 911,
but I might be having the baby here,
so, uh, just, you know, get here, please.
Hey, y-you sure you don't want to...
...lie down?
No.
I wish I had an epidural for you.
Don't need it. I am conquering the pain with my mind.
You weren't kidding.
You -- You know how to have a baby.
Okay, Ben, um, maybe go wash your hands,
'cause I need you to give me an exam,
because my water just broke.
Okay. Okay.
You-- You're probably gonna see my vagina, which might be weird.
Yeah, but, uh, you know, I'm a doctor,
so, you know, it's all good.
Okay. Right.
Tap it and let it settle
and then tap it some more.
You get more that way.
Why am I doing this?
Why did you make me do this?
Why the hell would you make me run?
I didn't make you run. You wanted to run.
You dangled the carrot.
You -- You dangled it because you didn't want
this wedding to happen, so you dangled.
I didn't dangle anything.
You're not a victim here.
I presented you with a menu of options.
You chose to run.
You wanted to run.
You're right. You're right.
Why am I marrying Owen?
Is my family right?
Is this just one more in a long line
of ill-advised, impulsive decisions?
I don't even know.
Shouldn't I know?
Shouldn't I know on my wedding day?
Probably.
Mer.
I mean, what if I'm just -- What if Owen is my new drug
and I'm just using him to ignore the fact that...
That what?
That Mer's right,
that Owen's had the love of his life and so have I,
and once it's gone, everything else is just filler
and you'll never, ever have that feeling again.
I mean, who gets that twice?
Some of us would like to have it once.
So, he just kept asking me to marry him again and again.
I just couldn't say nothing anymore, you know,
so I just... I just said no.
You could've said yes.
Here you go.
I should go home.
I need to go home.
What? Whoa. No, no, no, no, no.
You cannot drive home.
No, stupid, I'm gonna call.
I'm looking for my phone to call a Goober.
I can't marry him.
I want to, but I can't marry anyone.
Why's that?
Just 'cause -- none of your business.
Okay. Right. Sorry.
God, where is my. Oh, my God!
What?
This isn't even my purse.
Yeah, what can I get you?
I can't marry him because I'm already married.
Okay, okay.
It's done. Go. Do it.
Okay, you just relax, all right?
You know the drill.
You're gonna feel my hand...
Okay.
Okay, Warren, let's wrap it up.
Sorry. I just -- I-I -- I can't --
I don't know what I'm --
Come on. You've done a pelvic before, haven't you?
Yeah, plenty, plenty, but t-this doesn't feel right.
Don't tell me it doesn't feel right.
It's my freaking cervix.
Just check how dilated it is, and get out of my va--
A-April, April,
it's a foot.
I feel a foot.
No.
It's breech.
It's a footling breech.
Okay. Okay.
And -- And I feel the cord.
Wha--?
No. No.
Is -- Is there a pulse?
Answer me!
I don't think so, no.
No.
So my baby's gonna die?
No. No, April. No.
No, it just means that it's not getting
all the blood that it could be and that --
that we have to get the baby out as fast as possible
so we can get the pressure off the cord.
Okay. Okay.
So I need a C-section soon as possible.
Yes. Yes.
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay, um...
So...okay.
So...
The light is better in the kitchen.
What? Wait, wait, wait. No. No. No.
I'm not giving you a C-section.
Look, there's an ambulance coming. Ben, we both know
it doesn't matter.
I'm not doing it. I can't. We'll get you to the hospital.
My baby is dying, its blood supply is cut off,
and it's going to die.
There is an ambulance coming!
Ben! Ben!
Even if they were here now, they can't help me.
You can.
I-It's coming. It's coming.
Come on.
Okay, I know, Ben.
I know. I'm coming. I got held --
Well, um, on the plus side, um, you're well-liked.
A lot of people came.
And nobody wants to rush you.
They just want to know what's gonna happen.
What do you think?
Here's what I think, Karev.
I think if you get to the point
where you're gonna walk down the aisle with someone,
she's earned some trust... and faith.
She's earned the benefit of the doubt.
So I'm giving it to her.
She deserves that.
You're right.
You're absolutely right.
Are we going in?
Why are you looking at me?
Amelia?
I don't know.
If we don't go in, where would we go?
Why's everybody asking me?
Come on, Mer.
What do I know about getting married?
And who am I to say we only get one great love in our life?
Lots of people get two.
Look at...
Look at...
Well, I don't know. I can't think of any right now, but --
Richard Webber.
Yes! Exactly. Thank you.
Richard Webber. Exactly. You see?
Maybe we get two,
maybe we get 11, maybe we get 30.
Isn't that better, just to believe that?
Yeah. I mean, Owen believes it.
I swear he does.
And he loves you.
So maybe this time is different for you.
Maybe this time, you're right.
All right, now, listen.
There's no anesthesia.
Ice is all we got, so the pain's gonna --
The pain's gonna be bad.
Okay. All right?
Okay.
Why is she at Meredith's? I got to get my keys.
No, no. There's no time.
Here.
Right. You rotate the baby in utero -- face down.
No, I know. The position will look different than you've seen.
Okay.
Is she okay?
April? April?
Hey, April? Can she hear me?
Jackson, Jackson!
Jackson, I'm here.
Okay, okay, I'm right here.
Okay? I'm right here.
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
Ha! Jackpot!
What?
It's an old medical bag.
It must've been her mom's.
There's some gauze and, uh -- ha-ha! -- a scalpel.
And some lidocaine?
No.
Hey, Warren, what do you have to pack her with?
...dish towels.
Okay.
Can you feel that?
Yeah.
Okay, Ben, I need you to promise me something, okay?
Yeah.
If you feel like you're gonna lose me,
if I'm bleeding out, you...
No.
...you make sure that this baby is okay.
Oh, no, no, no.
April, do not -- Ben, don't listen to her, okay?
You save her. You save both of them.
You promise me that you will save this baby, no matter what.
Ben, okay?!
Warren, you have got this.
No!
You have got them both.
Ben, please. Okay?
Everybody, just quiet! Please.
Miranda?
Yes?
I want to do this, all right?
I-I have to do this, all right?
I know.
Ben, w-- d-don't hang up.
I trust you.
Okay. Okay.
Okay, hey, hey.
What's happening?
April, please?
Say something. Ben?
Say something. Ben?
Okay, come on.
Come on, now.
Okay. Here we go. Bedtime.
Let me get you some water, okay?
I was living in my car.
Did you know that I lived in my car?
Where are you going?
And then I met him,
and I wasn't living in my car anymore.
Everybody loved him.
I did.
W-What are you -- What are you doing?
I'm gonna go -- I'm gonna go to bed.
Um, I-I-I should go.
Okay, you're -- you're good, right?
Never wanted anyone to stop loving him.
So, if I...
...I bought the wrong something, he would...
he would hit me in my face.
Or my stomach. Or...
Nobody knew that but me.
So -- So I ran.
I had to make sure he would never find me.
And if you try to divorce him...
He would find me.
Does Karev know about any of this?
No. No.
Alex would try and protect me, but he can't.
Problem is...
he doesn't even know my real name.
You should tell him.
He'll understand.
Karev's a really -- Hey.
Okay, hey, don't.
Okay, don't do that, okay?
Let's get you into you bed, all right?
No, no. Stop.
Okay, no. No.
Dr. Karev, hold on.
Okay, hey! What are you
Alex!
Alex!
Hey. What are you doing here?
They asked me to give you this.
W-- Kepner's the --
Well, she forgot the rings at Meredith's,
and then everything went sideways and...
it's a girl.
She had the baby?
Yeah.
Some -- Well, I know you'll hear about it,
but, anyway, here.
Thanks.
You know, you didn't have to do this.
I know.
It's funny. Um...
The way things are going,
I'm not sure Amelia and I are --
She's back.
Where is she?
No, she doesn't want to see you now.
What? - Before the ceremony --
it's bad luck.
Hurry up and get in there.
I mean, she needs 10 minutes.
Okay. All right. All right.
Okay. All right.
Happy for you, man.
Thanks.
there'll be food after.
So, are you staying, then?
I might.
Yeah, I mean, I like a wedding.
It's funny. Owen was supposed to be my best man.
Anyway, what about you? Did you have a big wedding?
No.
We wrote our vows on a... on a Post-it note.
He was afraid of commitment?
No, just the opposite -- It was me.
He loved me so much, he didn't care.
Poor guy.
I barely gave him a wedding.
What'd you give him?
We went to City Hall.
Just the two of us.
Nice.
Yeah, it was very nice.
Megan, um...
she wanted a huge wedding.
She said, "Like a big party."
Derek would've loved a big party.
I should get in there.
You should.
Is this when we go? Do we go? Did we miss it?
Just go whenever you want.
Sure you don't want to run? Now's your last chance.
Please shut up.
We have to go. I'm going.
You look beautiful.
Congratulations.
Love has boundaries.
We know this.
I tried my best.
Please know that if I could've done more --
I know. I do.
She's stable.
Yeah, uh, Robbins is closing.
Your baby girl has a very strong mother.
Yeah, she does.
Dr. Warren.
Dr. Robbins tells me that
you showed superb technique
under trying conditions.
She said you saved two lives today.
We knock them down, build them back up,
and knock them down again...
but does it have to be that way?
Hi, Mama!
Hi! What's going on?
Plane tickets.
Bring her back next weekend.
And I want all summer and every other school year.
I want Christmas this time, but you can get next time...
...and we'll figure out the rest of the details.
What? Are you saying --
Listen, we did this wrong.
We had a chance to do it right,
and...we missed it.
Are you saying...?
I'm saying that
Sofia deserves to have two happy moms.
I'm saying - let's all be happy.
Thank you.
Can't we learn?
Can't we be brave?
Can't we believe?
Because maybe that's all we need --
a little courage,
A little hope,
a little belief.
She looks so lovely.
Maybe there are no boundaries if we choose to not see them.
Maybe love is unlimited if we're just brave enough
to decide love is limitless.
Maybe there's enough happy for everyone.
I like him.
Who?
Riggs.
I really like him.
I think he likes me.
Or maybe...
Give me a minute.
I'll think of something.
