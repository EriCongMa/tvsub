i passed ?
you &apos;re not an intern anymore .
george doesn &apos;t know i exist .
do you want to go on a date with me ?
what if i &apos;m not into it ?
i &apos;m not letting you do this to me , alex .
i know i &apos;m being an ass .
i think i found a way to save lives .
i could find patients for a clinical trial .
the tumor &apos;s shrinking. the virus is working .
you keep a diary ?
it &apos;s not mine .
whose is it ?
your mother &apos;s .
i am a rock .
i am an island .
that &apos;s the mantra of pretty much
every surgeon i &apos;ve ever met .
we like to think we &apos;re independent , loners , mavericks ...
that all we need to do our jobs
is an o.r. , a scalpel and a willing body .
a scalpel and a willing body .
is yang on call tonight ?
uh , yeah . why do you think it &apos;s so clean in here ?
but the truth is , not even
the best of us can do it alone .
surgery , like life , is a team sport .
can i just say , the whole &quot; taking it slow &quot; thing ?
best idea ever .
it really takes the pressure off .
mm . yeah .
we can just , you know , hang out
without all the ... the expectations .
why rush things ?
exactly .
and eventually , you &apos;ve got to get off the bench and decide ...
what team are you batting for ?
you know , one of the joys of cohabitation is having breakfast together .
well , i can &apos;t today because bailey paged us in early .
i guess you don &apos;t have time to look
at our work in a major medical journal .
they published our clinical trial ? mm @-@ hmm .
it &apos;s on the cover .
&quot; a new method in treating inoperable malignant gliomas ...
the shepherd method . &quot;
what do you think ?
it &apos;s a picture , a big picture of you .
you &apos;re making a face .
i &apos;m not making a face . i love that picture .
i have to go .
&quot; the shepherd method . &quot;
it &apos;s about time this hospital got some good publicity for a change .
oh , i heard you found a donor .
yes , sir . the last piece of the puzzle finally fell into place .
this is the day , dr. bailey
the day that seattle grace comes back swinging .
shepherd on the front page of a national journal ,
bragging rights to a flashy surgery
i don &apos;t see mercy west taking on a project of this magnitude , do you ?
i &apos;d rather wait to celebrate till we pull this thing off .
yeah , that &apos;s a good call. we don &apos;t want to jinx it .
eat that , mercy west .
god , i &apos;ve been looking everywhere for you .
well , i had an early morning palatoplasty .
you see this ? &quot; the shepherd method &quot; ?
yeah , yeah , very impressive .
listen , last night , erica ...
you think they airbrushed his picture ?
i mean , the man does not have one damn pore .
could you focus ? i need you right now .
all right , well , i &apos;m a little exhausted ,
but if you want to hop on and do all the work ...
no , i need to talk .
last night , erica and i ... we ...
we did it. sort of .
congratulations .
no. no , no .
it was not good at all .
i choked .
i couldn &apos;t go down there .
i @-@ i tried , but it just felt so weird
and clinical , like gynie rotation .
i left this morning before she got up .
i couldn &apos;t even face her .
what if ... what if me and erica are ...
what if ... what if we were a mistake ?
where are you going ?
i can &apos;t talk about this .
oh , come on . you love talking about this stuff .
girl on girl . it &apos;s hot .
two girls getting nasty and loving it ? that &apos;s hot .
one girl talking about how much it sucked ?
depressing and wrong .
just wrong .
the chief wants us to give george one of our interns ?
except for grey . she already lost o &apos;malley .
just dump your dead weight .
oh , please. they &apos;re all dead weight .
that &apos;s why i need all four of them , not three .
george is filling out paperwork , getting his real live doctor wings ,
so i thought now would be a good time to decorate his locker .
give me that coffee .
okay . i don &apos;t even want the credit , but the clinical trial was my idea .
and i had to beg him to do it , more than once .
it &apos;s okay you want the credit . i would want the credit .
when you screw the attendings , you get screwed .
they have all the power .
interns . you could screw interns .
i mean date . residents could date interns ,
&apos;cause we &apos;re nonthreatening .
i read this study once that said that
interns hardly ever file sexual harassment
claims because we feel so weak and powerless in the hospital environment ,
interns ... the other white meat .
where are we going ?
you &apos;ll see when we get there .
dr. bailey , i &apos;m actually on dr. sloan &apos;s service today .
everyone &apos;s off their services . you &apos;re all with me .
where are we going ?
you &apos;ll see when we get there .
hey , did you see your locker ?
i put a smelly candle in it ,
so now your scrubs are gonna smell like cinnamon bun .
gosh , thanks .
dr. bailey , dr. sloan is doing a transpalatal advancement .
i &apos;ve never seen one .
hahn said i could scrub in on her aortic bypass .
and i really need to get to the clinic .
i &apos;ve staffed it with nurses and p.s. ,
but i &apos;m the only doctor on call ,
and i &apos;ve got administrative work to ...
today is not about you .
it is not about whose services you wish to be on .
it &apos;s not about your career . this is about me .
this is a project i &apos;ve been working on for a long time ,
and it &apos;s very important to me , therefore it will be very important to you .
and the only way we can pull this thing off
is if we work together as a team ,
so today , you are not 15 individual doctors ,
you are one team of surgeons representing this hospital .
is everybody clear on that ?
um , why would they need so many doctors for one surgery ?
i don &apos;t know .
because it &apos;s not just one surgery .
it &apos;s 12 surgeries ... 6 kidney transplants in six o.r.s ,
all at the same time .
paired matching kidney donation .
a 6 @-@ way swap ... 6 people donate kidneys to total strangers ,
six people get kidneys from total strangers .
12 people walk away happy .
paired matching kidney donation .
otherwise known as ... dude , a domino surgery .
stan mercer , 46 , chronic renal failure secondary to high blood pressure .
his wife here wanted to donate a kidney to him , but she wasn &apos;t a match .
so she will be donating her kidney to ms.chen over there ,
who is a match ,
while mr.mercer will be getting a kidney from this young man today .
nice to meet you .
p.j. , please .
kurt walling 58 chronic renal failure secondary to diabetes .
his son p.j. wasn &apos;t a match , so mr.walling will be
getting ms.herman &apos;s kidney today .
thanks for the kidney ms.herman.
call me lindsay .
we &apos;re gonna be pretty close by the end of the day .
and so on and so forth .
why do you still look stupid ?
well , maybe if we had a cheat sheet .
ms.herman gives her kidney to mr.walling.
mr.walling &apos;s son gives his kidney to mr.mercer.
mr.mercer &apos;s wife gives her kidney to ms.chen.
ms.chen &apos;s sister gives her kidney to mr. patel .
mr. patel &apos;s wife gives her kidney to ms.loring ,
who came in with her cousin , ms.gomez ,
who &apos;s giving her kidney to mr. cross , the professional flautist .
for those of you without a photographic memory ,
it &apos;s up on a board in the conference room .
and why do we have to do all six transplants at one time ?
so no one backs out at the last minute .
why would anybody back out ? it &apos;s such an incredible thing to be a part of .
well , passing the organ &apos;s kinda creepy . i &apos;d back out .
yeah , yeah , that &apos;s why this whole surgery is a giant house of cards .
if we lose one donor , we lose them all .
so you will not only provide excellent medical care ,
but you will keep your patients happy .
we need to make sure this whole thing
doesn &apos;t fall apart before the surgery . any questions ?
um , i heard when they did a domino at boston gen ,
the residents all got to keep one of
the dead kidneys in a jar as a souvenir .
i want a kidney in a jar .
me , too , can i have a kidney ?
well , if they get kidneys , i get a kidney .
quantities are limited . i asked first . can we ?
no one is taking home a kidney in a jar .
diseased kidneys are not tchotchkes for your coffee table .
now go. go .
hey , you okay ?
uh , bailey snagged all the surgical residents and interns ,
so i &apos;m stuck with the psych interns . not the sharpest .
okay , you &apos;re busy . i &apos;ll be brief .
i was thinking , if you weren &apos;t on call tonight , that , maybe we could
uh , go to my place , order in dinner , rent a movie .
tonight ? you want to get together again tonight ?
well , i had a lot of fun last night .
fun .
anyway , just let me know .
okay , as you may know , one of you is going to o &apos;malley today .
oh , me ! i @-@ i &apos;ll go if you need a volunteer .
i decide who gets to go after i decide which one of you sucks the most .
and you better not suck on purpose , because i will know .
honey , would you like your book or some music ,
something to help you relax ?
i don &apos;t know. maybe some water .
how about some ice chips instead ?
your ankles are looking a little thick .
my wife loves tracking my fluid retention .
and , megan ,
will you please come over here and
tape the needles so we can start dialysis ?
sounds just like a real doctor .
uh , it says here that you don &apos;t have
a loved one in the domino , ms.herman
no .
so you &apos;re just donating a kidney to
a complete stranger for nothing in return ?
it &apos;s really no big deal .
i have two kidneys , and they say you can live with one , so ...
are you kidding ? that &apos;s amazing , what you &apos;re doing .
u.n.o.s. is always short on organs .
if everyone in the world did this-- yeah ,
it &apos;d be all peace and love and unicorns .
she gets it , grey .
i &apos;m so sick of all the &quot; yay , you . &quot;
i totally understand .
oh. the chief has got me doing press all day with journalists .
my face is starting to hurt from smiling .
uh @-@ huh . i already pushed that .
it comes faster when i push it .
oh , must be that shepherd method .
funny .
i think i &apos;ll take the stairs .
meredith , are you bothered by this ?
why would i be bothered ?
you can &apos;t call it the shepherd @-@ grey method
because then people would think you had help .
so do i really have to give my kidney to that old guy ?
mr. mercer couldn &apos;t be more than 50 .
my son &apos;s 22 .
to him , everyone over 40 is on the brink of death .
turned 23 in august .
oh , that &apos;s right .
maybe we could have
a little belated party here in the hospital ,
get you an ice cream cake .
you used to love those .
yeah , when i was 7 .
look , i &apos;m not here for a reunion .
i just want to get this over with and get out of here , okay ?
so you are on dialysis four times a week now ?
they might as well chain me to the machine at this point .
my kidneys are shot . i &apos;m living on borrowed time .
so i &apos;m pretty lucky to have a son who would do this for me .
you &apos;re lucky you &apos;re loaded .
so when do i get the 10,000 bucks
before or after the surgery ?
it &apos;s a christmas gift .
well , it &apos;s october .
i see you two hovering .
hypothetically , say a patient was ...
paying his son for a kidney , what exactly would happen ?
paying money for a kidney ?
hypothetically .
like someone stole an organ herself
not that long ago ,
you should know ,
what would happen is
your patient would be out of the exchange .
which means that this person ,
since her husband &apos;s no longer getting a kidney ,
would drop out .
then they would drop out , then they would drop out ,
then the whole thing would fall apart .
that &apos;s what would happen .
so if you both are suggesting that
that &apos;s what &apos;s going on here ,
you &apos;d better be damn sure about it .
it &apos;s just a gift .
uh , an early stocking stuffer .
most girls your age , they &apos;re busy shopping .
you &apos;re in the hospital giving a kidney to a stranger .
oh , i &apos;m not such a saint .
your kidney may not be going directly to my husband ,
but you &apos;re one of the people saving his life today .
to me , your mother teresa .
honey , would you mind
running and getting a wet washcloth for me ?
i &apos;m just-- oh , yeah , of course. excuse me .
thank you .
you know
my mother invented the grey method all by herself .
you know , maybe you should stop reading her diary .
it &apos;s gonna make you feel inadequate .
she &apos;s dead and in the past and still outpacing me .
okay , see , see that intern over there ? is he clean ?
huh ? what ?
well , i was just thinking
what lexopedia said , and , you know ,
she may be on to something .
you &apos;re gonna sleep with an intern ?
it &apos;d just be scratching the itch .
it &apos;s been a long time .
i can &apos;t do this .
all these people telling me how
wonderful and selfless and giving i am-- i @-@ i
can &apos;t take it anymore , especially not from her .
all right , just keep your voice down .
did you see her face , thanking me for saving your life ?
stan , this is crazy .
you promised you would tell her. please !
ah. mr. mercer , is everything okay ?
no , i don &apos;t feel so good , actually .
tell her !
if the past three years have meant anything to you
you have to tell her !
stan ?
i &apos;m not an idiot . i know there have been other women .
all these years , i told myself it was just sex. it &apos;s just ...
my god , stan. she &apos;s giving a kidney for you .
that--that &apos;s not sex. it &apos;s family .
all right , his cardiac enzymes and e.k.g. look good .
he had an acute anxiety attack . i can clear him for surgery .
i do everything for you .
i &apos;ve given up my entire life to get you to dialysis ,
drive you to the doctors
i didn &apos;t ask you to do any of that .
i can drive a car . i can pour my own juice .
i got sick , not elderly .
well , don &apos;t worry .
i won &apos;t do one more thing for you ,
and that includes giving a kidney .
get on the phone with u.n.o.s.
tell them we need a kidney
that matches mrs. mercer &apos;s antibodies .
u.n.o.s. is a long shot .
it &apos;s the only shot we have. now go , now .
she &apos;s barely a second @-@ year resident .
i made the virus. she assisted .
when michael jordan scores , no one cares about the assist .
i don &apos;t know. scottie pippen ...
you know what i mean .
these women , they overthink everything .
somebody &apos;s cranky today. what is that ?
&quot; experimental treatments for cleft palates . &quot;
huh. you &apos;re working on your own clinical trial , aren &apos;t you ?
i &apos;m--i &apos;m just-- i &apos;m doing a little research .
the very sight of me reminds you that you &apos;ve not made
one worthwhile contribution to medical history , doesn &apos;t it ?
get out .
you should read my article .
it will enrich your life , make you a better man .
i &apos;m saving it for the bathroom .
it started as an office thing , you know , light , fun .
and then one day you wake up , and ...
this older guy is all you can think about .
you &apos;d do anything for him , even give a kidney .
why ?
i could save his life , too .
i mean , she may be married to him but i &apos;m saving his life today , too .
so then he &apos;ll finally have to choose .
her or me ?
apparently , erica loved it , the non @-@ sex sex .
i think she might want more.-happens to me all the time with women .
i barely remember it , their minds are blown .
that &apos;s your sage advice ?
i &apos;m a world @-@ class surgeon ,
double boarded in plastics and e.n.t.
i have more meaningful and worthwhile things
to do than dispense sex advice .
yeah , like what ?
nice .
oh , come on. no , mark , i need your help .
excuse me .
what is going on ?
trying to decide which of our interns to give to george .
in front of us .
they &apos;re deciding in front of us , like livestock at a state fair .
i think i &apos;ll keep lexopedia. she remembers many things .
mm @-@ hmm. and she bathes , which is much more than i can say for ...
stinky two over there .
you smell .
well , graciella charts like crap .
but she can put in a line .
claire , on the other hand , nearly castrated a guy with a catheter .
we can hear you .
i might dump pierce .
ooh , how does he suck ?
i just hate saying the name pierce .
mm. we should revolt .
they &apos;d respect us more
if we didn &apos;t participate in our own humiliation .
yeah .
you revolt first , and i &apos;ll follow .
hey , have you heard from u.n.o.s. yet ?
still searching for a match .
but so far , nothing .
i hope they come through .
my guy really needs a kidney .
yeah , they all need kidneys , izzie .
if derek needed a kidney , i wouldn &apos;t give him one .
he &apos;d take the credit .
he &apos;d say he magically grew it himself .
my guy &apos;s been sick for 15 years .
can you imagine having your life on hold like that ?
plus , he &apos;s got such a crappy kid .
hey ! did i say you could put that down ?
no , so pick it up .
weak. no stamina .
yeah , but he takes orders .
true. true .
is my husband getting a kidney or not ?
wait , what about my sister ?
if she &apos;s not getting a kidney today ,
i am not giving mine to some stranger .
i will do my best to make sure everyone gets a kidney today .
i &apos;ll update you as soon as i have information. please .
sir , i--i &apos;ve got this under control .
i have grey talking with u.n.o.s.
i have
we are being featured on the national news .
all eyes are on seattle grace .
fix this .
yes , sir .
i have been poked and prodded like a lab rat ,
what , all for nothing ?
we got to spend time with each other .
that &apos;s not nothing .
oh , oh , now you want to spend time together ?
well , you &apos;re about 20 years too late .
so , yeah , nothing .
p.j ...
do i still get the $ 10,000 if the surgery doesn &apos;t happen ?
&apos;cause if not , i &apos;m outta here . i have a life to get back to .
please . i need you .
if you could ... just be patient a little bit longer ...
i was gonna punch that kid .
i mean , what kind of a selfish idiot-- his father is sick ,
he &apos;s really sick , and all he cares about is his stupid money .
all right , the guy must have done something really bad to make the kid so angry .
maybe he just cares about his son ,
but the moron is too emotionally stunted to let him .
okay , uh , i &apos;m--i &apos;m-- i &apos;m trying to be , uh ... i am , but this right here ?
this--this-- this is exactly your problem .
you get all wrapped up and involved and you
just-- you start--you start caring about these people .
your patient in there , he &apos;s the moron .
his son &apos;s never gonna give him what he wants ,
and he &apos;s just gonna be disappointed .
and the sooner he gets that , the sooner you get it ...
no , go on , please .
be a selfish ass .
&apos;cause at least then i know what to expect .
&apos;cause this being a decent guy one second and a total jerk the next ,
it &apos;s getting really old , alex .
so who &apos;s it gonna be ? pick one .
o &apos;malley .
&apos;sup , bud ?
hey. missed you at lunch today .
it was an all @-@ new level of hell .
oh , no , i was busy doing my own charts .
the interns don &apos;t respect me .
i would respect you if i was your intern .
george , they don &apos;t respect you because they &apos;re not scared of you .
just decimate one every few days .
it &apos;s not rocket science. two .
who &apos;s getting , uh , ms. herman &apos;s kidney ?
uh , i can-- i can go check .
three ?
mr. walling .
that &apos;s right. no . i totally forgot .
you forgot .
like you forgot to do your notes before rounds ?
or like you forgot to pull the drain on my post @-@ op s.b.o. ?
or like you forgot to sign all your dictation , so all your charts-- uh ,
my charts--are delinquent ?
you forgot ...
because the only thing you can retain in that
pea @-@ sized brain of yours is what time lunch is .
grey here is gonna become a surgeon
while you dig ditches by the side of the road .
it &apos;s brutal , but it &apos;s effective .
i am not gonna do this with you .
do what ?
have this silent fight .
i &apos;m gonna write the editors and have them
print a correction-- the shepherd @-@ grey method .
i don &apos;t want you to give me credit because you &apos;re mad that i &apos;m mad .
i want you to give me credit because you
think i worked hard for it and i deserve it .
you don &apos;t deserve it. you &apos;re a baby .
you have the potential to be a good surgeon , maybe a great one .
but you haven &apos;t even scratched the surface on what you need to learn .
it was my idea .
and i hate that picture .
any available i.v. nurse to the e.r.
u.n.o.s. doesn &apos;t have a match .
okay .
uh , we can , um ...
we &apos;ve been stalling. we haven &apos;t released anyone .
i can talk to ms.mercer
you can &apos;t do anything that could be seen as coercion .
u.n.o.s. is very clear .
but , sir
the last thing we need is to lose our status as a transplant center .
let the patients go home .
it &apos;s over .
i &apos;ve got a cabg in an hour. want to get some coffee ?
i &apos;m not cut out for this .
coffee ?
no , this , the--the touching and the ... sex with a girl .
i just--i @-@ i can &apos;t do it . i thought i could but ...
but you did do it . i don &apos;t understand .
it wasn &apos;t good for you .
i can &apos;t believe it .
i got so close .
you &apos;re gonna be pretty high on the transplant list .
something else will come up .
it &apos;s not the kidney i &apos;m upset about .
oh. your son .
we hadn &apos;t spoken in over a year .
it took me months to find him .
this was my chance to get him back .
right .
i know p.j. can be selfish ...
rude ...
but it hasn &apos;t been easy for him .
his mom died .
i worked late most nights .
i made a lot of mistakes .
you can &apos;t blame yourself .
some people are just broken .
i guess you just try not to care too much .
then you can &apos;t be disappointed .
these are , uh , your discharge papers .
i &apos;m sorry .
i don &apos;t know why i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m so sorry .
it &apos;s okay .
now all you have to do is sign there at the bottom , and you &apos;re free to go .
you must think i &apos;m a terrible person ...
refusing to give my kidney .
we &apos;re not thinking anything , ma &apos;am .
he &apos;s taken everything .
my love , my pride , my dignity-- it &apos;s all gone .
but the one thing that he doesn &apos;t have is the kidney .
and the thought of giving him that last part of me ...
you must think i &apos;m a terrible person .
i &apos;m not allowed to think anything .
there are rules that prevent me from having an opinion here good rules
rules in place for a reason-- because giving an organ that god put in
your body to someone else isn &apos;t something that you can be coerced into doing .
it is ... a big thing .
it is an extraordinary thing .
it &apos;s a gift that must be freely given .
and if you were to give it , and i &apos;m not asking you to ,
but if you were to give it , it &apos;s not just for your husband .
it &apos;s for five other people , people that you don &apos;t know from adam .
our six donors are all anesthetized and ready to go .
they &apos;ll be done first , followed by the recipients .
each pair will be color @-@ coded so as not to confuse them .
this surgery is a hornet &apos;s nest , people , so work quickly but carefully .
use each other. operate as a team .
let &apos;s go make medical history .
we &apos;re lucky as hell that woman changed her mind .
yes , we are. yes , we are .
huh. now that &apos;s what i call a nice @-@ looking kidney .
put that on ice and start flushing in the preservation solution .
you want to do the honors , dr. yang ?
good .
come on .
that &apos;s quite a geyser of urine , sir .
that means we did our job right .
you never get tired of seeing that .
we &apos;re ready for you , grey .
walking with the kidney .
five second rule.five second rule
hold it still , boki .
i &apos;m gonna need more ice , uh , and another tie .
i &apos;ll get it .
no , you don &apos;t touch anything else .
someone dropped a damn kidney ?
i know you don &apos;t want to talk about it anymore .
i know you &apos;re over it .
oh , for the love of god .
just hear me out .
i like to be good at things , okay ?
i do not fail .
i do not quit .
i like to be good at things , and i want to be good at this .
so ... i need you .
i need you to show me .
show you ?
just because you didn &apos;t publish a big clinical trial
doesn &apos;t mean you &apos;re not a genius .
fine. take off your pants .
really ? oh , my god. thank you .
thank you so much .
i &apos;ll show you the sloan method .
won &apos;t ever be in a medical journal , but it should .
shouldn &apos;t it be pinking up by now ?
it &apos;s just getting venous blood .
let &apos;s check the back side again .
i think i see ... a little pink , maybe .
ah , come on , come on .
all right .
come on .
come on , pink up .
come on .
pink up , pink up , pink up , pink up .
come on .
yes. yeah , it looks good .
we have a live kidney .
oh , come on . i am offering two interns .
two interns for the price of one--come on .
i &apos;ll trade you laura for both of &apos; em .
leo drains pus and likes it .
i dropped an internal organ ... on the floor .
it happens .
okay , okay . uh , how about this ?
four goes to george . i get james .
karev , you get two . izzie , give leo .
what are you people doing ?
we were just , uh , just deciding which
of our interns to give to george .
oh , you think i got to choose my interns ,
and i picked you people &apos; cause
you &apos;re all such a surgical dream team ?
you--you &apos;re lazy . you &apos;re whiny .
butterfingers over there
is downright depressing , and you , yang ,
you-- you &apos;re just annoying .
choosing their own interns ...
what are--what ...
give me those damn cards .
o &apos;malley ...
you have interns .
what is it ?
okay , open his fluids .
karev , push a gram of mag .
do a c.b.c. and electrolytes .
stevens , uh , order a color flow doppler
and do a full neuro workup .
you think there &apos;s a bleed ?
there &apos;s no way of knowing till
we evaluate everything .
where is ... p.j. ?
where &apos;s my son ?
stan had better be dead right now .
he &apos;s doing fine .
he hasn &apos;t called my room .
just lay back .
he hasn &apos;t asked for me .
it &apos;s been three years .
i gave a kidney for him ,
and he still hasn &apos;t made a choice .
he hasn &apos;t asked about you or called .
i think he &apos;s made a choice .
but i gave a kidney for him .
i gave a kidney .
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
hey , man , the nurse was supposed to
to bring my dinner like an hour ago .
your dad just had a seizure .
okay . so what does that mean ?
it means something &apos;s wrong .
it means he could be dying ,
and he doesn &apos;t know you give a crap .
honestly , he doesn &apos;t know , and maybe
you don &apos;t , but if you do , he &apos;s dying ,
and you &apos;re gonna be too late . alex , stop .
he &apos;s asking for you , and you &apos;re gonna be too late ,
and you &apos;re gonna live with it
for the rest of your life !
you really want to live with that , huh ? do you ?
alex ! alex .
so tomorrow we &apos;ll meet ,
one hour before pre @-@ rounds .
dude , that &apos;s , like , 4 : 00 a.m.
dr. stevens never made us
come in before pre @-@ rounds .
yeah , o &apos;malley , you gotta chill .
they probably should say dr. o &apos;malley .
so those are your interns ?
did you even ask for me ?
what ?
i helped you study .
i helped decorate your stupid locker .
i--and you didn &apos;t-- you don &apos;t
you don &apos;t even see it .
you don &apos;t see anything .
i am such an idiot .
and you are a jerk .
you didn &apos;t even think to ask for me ?
screw you , dr. o &apos;malley .
uh , mr. cross , mr. patel ,
ms.chen , ms. loring and mr.mercer
they &apos;re all stable .
but mr. walling , he has delayed graft function
and god knows what else .
ah , the press is gonna be all over this tomorrow .
and i &apos;ll need you available for interviews
and some photo @-@ ops .
make sure you wear your nice scrubs .
did you hear me , sir ?
mr.walling--he has a serious complication .
his electrolytes are off , his crit &apos;s down .
but you saved five other lives .
that &apos;s a pretty good scorecard .
not perfect , but good .
i told you . i don &apos;t want to see stan .
i &apos;m not taking you to see stan .
oh , this is her .
this is the woman who gave me her kidney .
how &apos;s she doing ?
i &apos;m keeping a close eye on her ,
but so far , she &apos;s completely stable .
come with me .
this man is very ill , maybe dying .
he &apos;s got a perfect , healthy donor kidney
that wasn &apos;t dropped on the floor .
there &apos;s only so much we can help ...
and so much we can hurt .
forgive yourself .
visiting hours are over .
it &apos;s okay .
your urine output is up to 25 cc &apos;s per hour .
that should make you happy .
my wife would &apos;ve been happy .
who &apos;s gonna care about my urine output now ?
well , things are gonna be a little different .
ah , dr. bailey .
i heard your big surgery went well today .
congratulations .
same to you .
must feel good to see
your name in print like that .
it would feel better if
meredith wasn &apos;t so-- you know ,
she &apos;s acting silly about the credit .
she &apos;s getting emotional .
that girl worked her ass off for you ,
and you got all the credit .
i would &apos;ve gotten all the blame had we failed .
but you didn &apos;t fail .
it &apos;s simple . i &apos;m an attending .
she &apos;s a second @-@ year resident .
who you &apos;re now living with .
that &apos;s not simple . it &apos;s messy .
if it were me , i &apos;d start with &quot; thank you . &quot;
you &apos;d be surprised how far that one goes ,
especially with us silly , emotional women .
so derek said that i was a baby .
what ?
and that i had a lot to learn .
whatever .
i mean , not whatever . he &apos;s right .
i did drop a kidney .
and don &apos;t say it happens , because it doesn &apos;t .
but i do hate it when he &apos;s right .
no , okay , he is not right .
stop caring so much about what he thinks .
it makes you seem desperate .
okay , to the one trolling for interns .
yeah , i changed my mind .
interns are weak . i don &apos;t want weak .
you know , burke was a man .
he was a man .
joe .
i think , uh , we need another round .
hey , joe . how you doing ?
excuse me . here you go .
wh--ho-- is this for me ?
yes .
hey , honey . i brought you roses .
let me back in the house .
no .
yes .
holy crap . what the hell is that thing ?
oh , that is a kidney in a jar .
that &apos;s not fair .
how did you get that ?
well , being an incredibly important ,
fancy neurosurgeon has its perks .
thank you .
i couldn &apos;t have done it without you ,
not one surgery , not one patient .
i couldn &apos;t have done any of it without you .
thanks .
yeah ,
could you guys go ahead and get this thing the
hell out of here before people
start to freak out ? okay .
okay . um , are you gonna be okay ?
yeah , yeah , go ahead .
all right . good night .
good night .
good night , joe .
the thing about choosing teams in real life ,
it &apos;s nothing like it used to be in gym class .
being first pick can be terrifying .
take off your pants .
excuse me ?
take off ... your pants .
we &apos;re trying this again .
and being chosen last ...
isn &apos;t the worst thing in the world .
what ?
i care about you .
i care about you , and i &apos;m not gonna go crazy ,
and i &apos;m not gonna try to kill myself ,
and i &apos;m not gonna stop caring about you ,
no matter how hard you push me away .
shut up and get out of my room .
no .
i care about you .
and i know you care about me , too .
it is not too late for us .
get out of my room .
admit it . admit that you care about me , too .
i know you do , and i care about you .
i care about you .
i care about you .
i care about you . i care about you .
i-- so we watch from the sidelines ,
clinging to our isolation ...
it glows .
yeah .
when my mother was a resident ,
she wasn &apos;t dropping kidneys .
you &apos;re reading your mom &apos;s diary ?
yeah .
i &apos;m not half the surgeon my mother was .
because we know as soon as
we let go of the bench ...
what , are you leaving already ?
there are no real men left in the world , joe .
see you .
yeah .
hey , shot and a beer . uh , whiskey .
you know what ? better make it just the beer .
i start work tomorrow .
someone comes along and
changes the game completely .
