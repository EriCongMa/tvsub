completely empty box .
if you &apos;d like to examine it ...
mm @-@ hmm . yep .
i see nothing in this box but a wasted childhood .
little snarky there , cello lessons .
and we have this completely ordinary cylinder .
if you &apos;d like to examine it ...
ordinary , yet i sense it is
dripping with magical potential .
oh , dear lord .
a man pops out for a moment to evacuate his bowels
and catch up on the adventures of the caped crusader ,
only to emerge and discover his apartment
has been transformed into a cabaret .
sheldon , he &apos;s just practicing for
his cousin &apos;s birthday party .
as i was saying ...
empty box , empty cylinder ,
and ... ooh !
voila .
i &apos;m telling you , dude , there &apos;s a seat on
the hogwarts express with your name on it .
this is how you &apos;re going to entertain
your little cousin and his friends ?
by lying to them ?
how is this lying ?
a magic show is an inherently deceitful proposition .
&quot; this is an ordinary top hat . &quot;
&quot; you &apos;ve chosen that card freely . &quot;
&quot; i do not have a set of lock picks lodged in my keister . &quot;
can &apos;t you just enjoy the wonder , sheldon ?
why must you peek behind the curtain ?
or up the butt ?
if we poison the critical thinking faculties of children
by telling them that rabbits come out of hats ,
then we create adults who believe in astrology and homeopathy
and that ryan reynolds was a better choice
for green lantern than lovable rogue nathan fillion .
sheldon ,
he &apos;s just gonna do a few magic tricks for some kids .
i really don &apos;t think they &apos;re gonna end up
liking the green lantern movie .
don &apos;t be so hard on him .
it &apos;s natural to be a little cranky when you have ...
a quarter in your ear !
coins lodged in body parts is not a source of amusement .
when i was five , billy sparks put
a mexican peso up my nose .
wait @-@ wait @-@ wait , how is that not amusing ?
it &apos;s still there .
takes me 45 minutes to get through airport security .
look , i made sheldon disappear . ta @-@ da .
next time , you should open with that .
ooh , look who &apos;s out on a date .
pasadena &apos;s favorite power couple , shamy .
and that is the answer to the question ,
what is wrong with eating at the cheesecake factory ?
so , are we celebrating anything special tonight ?
oh , yes .
our relationship agreement specifies
that the second thursday of every month ,
or the third thursday in a month with five thursdays ,
is date night .
that is so hot .
all right , without objection , the minutes of the previous date
are considered read and agreed to .
any new business ?
how was your day ?
superb .
this morning i made a palindrome
with my alpha @-@ bits .
&quot; nice hat , bob tahecin . &quot;
sounds like you hit the ground running .
i have a bit of good news myself .
my most recent paper
on how a cooperative long @-@ term potentiation
can map memory sequences in dendritic branches
made the cover of neuron .
ooh ! speaking of good news ,
somebody ...
just hit 100 twitter followers .
that &apos;s nice .
anyway , i &apos;ve been dreaming of this day
for a long time .
yeah , me , too .
triple digits , i &apos;m not gonna lie--
it feels pretty good .
sheldon ,
i &apos;m the sole author on a paper being published
in a distinguished journal that may change
the course of my field .
ooh , 101 !
air &apos;s getting a bit thin up here .
so , are we ready to order ?
give me a minute .
i &apos;m gonna go wash up .
well , that &apos;s odd .
we both washed up when we came in .
it &apos;s probably a euphemism for urination .
sheldon , what is wrong with you ?
not much . although , i can be faulted
for being overly fond of koala bears .
i don &apos;t know what it is ,
when they start munching on eucalyptus ,
i just melt inside .
okay , amy just told you some exciting news ,
and you acted like it was no big deal .
oh , i see why you &apos;re confused .
no , her news sounded important , but what you &apos;re forgetting is ,
it was an achievement in the field of biology .
that &apos;s all about yucky , squishy things .
honey , she &apos;s upset . you &apos;re her boyfriend .
you have to at least try to be excited
by the things she &apos;s excited by .
what if they simply don &apos;t excite me ?
well , just smile and think about koalas .
she &apos;d see right through that .
we go to the zoo all the time .
she knows my koala face .
and for future reference , it &apos;s this .
oh , you have a lot of magic stuff .
yeah .
i started when i was a teenager .
i thought i could show a girl a few tricks
and invite her up to my bedroom to see the rest of the act .
did it work ?
ah , let &apos;s just say the only wand
that ever saw any action was this one .
oh , look what my mom made us for the act .
i like the fabric .
where &apos;d she get it ?
well , she cut up one of her old bathing suits .
she made these two vests and half a dozen napkins .
has she tried on the vest yet ? !
i just gave it to her !
i hope it fits-- she has a tricky figure !
she &apos;s short and stacked , like me !
she &apos;s not stacked like you , ma ! she never steps on hers !
listen , howie , maybe i &apos;m not the best choice
to be a magician &apos;s assistant .
you &apos;ll do fine . hand me those rings ?
see ? you nailed it .
you know , i @-@ it &apos;s just that i &apos;m not that comfortable with little kids .
well , that &apos;s because you haven &apos;t been around them much .
this is good practice . i mean ,
you are gonna be a mom someday , right ?
yeah , sure .
i haven &apos;t seen this trick in years .
it &apos;s called the dove pan .
you let everyone see the pan is empty ,
but there &apos;s a secret compartment in the lid .
and then you open it and produce a live ...
don &apos;t look in there .
oh , a little red dead redemption , huh ?
yes .
how come you &apos;re not doing a mission ?
you &apos;re just wandering around .
had a rough night .
i thought i &apos;d go for a walk and clear my head .
some people go outside and do that .
it &apos;s after 9 : 00-- at this hour the streets of pasadena
are teeming with drunken sailors and alley cats .
you want to talk about it ?
no .
i think i &apos;ll just go in this saloon
and drink my troubles away .
you know digital alcohol is never a solution .
what &apos;s going on ?
hard as this may be to believe ,
it &apos;s possible that i &apos;m not boyfriend material .
glad i was sitting down for that .
did you and amy get in a fight ?
amy had a fight ; i was being perfectly reasonable .
i &apos;m gonna have a whiskey .
do you want anything ?
no , i can &apos;t .
i &apos;m playing grand theft auto later .
look , i &apos;m no expert in women ...
i &apos;ll say .
that &apos;s not necessary when someone &apos;s trying to help you .
i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s the alcohol talking . go on .
sometimes with women you want to listen to what upsets them
and then show them that you can grow and change .
nuts to that . what else you got ?
i don &apos;t know what to tell you .
buy her something .
how does that work ?
well , you skip over any attempt to repair your emotional connection
and you win back her affection with an empty financial gesture .
well , that approach has sheldon cooper written all over it .
glad i could help .
it &apos;s appreciated .
and if you ever manage to find a woman again ,
i &apos;ll be glad to return the favor .
and now , all the rings are
magically linked together .
my fiance &apos;s wearing a magic ring , too .
it made all my money disappear .
oh , ah , right .
and now , the great howdini &apos;s
next miraculous illusion .
when are we gonna have cake ?
after you &apos;ve been thoroughly amazed .
but we want cake now .
well , you &apos;re not getting cake right now , capisce ?
okay . okay .
now , my lovely assistant is going to bring me
an ordinary pitcher of milk .
i know how you do that trick .
do you know how to pipe down ?
okay , we &apos;re going to
roll up this newspaper .
it &apos;s a fake pitcher .
you got wax in your ears ?
the man said it &apos;s an ordinary pitcher .
howdini .
okay , we &apos;re going to stick this in here .
and then i &apos;m going to pour in the milk .
i hope this works ,
because i didn &apos;t bring a change of pants .
look , i googled it .
it &apos;s a fake pitcher .
that &apos;s it .
no cake for you .
anyone else want to join the no cake club ?
she &apos;s just kidding , boys and girls .
everyone gets cake .
not him .
just give me the pitcher .
behold !
wrong pitcher .
i told you i &apos;m not good with kids .
yes , you did .
oh , i think my crotch is starting to curdle .
the thing is , my mother worked full @-@ time .
i had to take care of my brothers and sisters .
yeah , so ?
ugh , it was horrible !
with their snotty noses and their poopy diapers
and their little shrieky voices , always complaining .
&quot; i don &apos;t want to get dressed . &quot;
&quot; joey keeps spitting in my mouth . &quot;
&quot; this isn &apos;t the way mom makes waffles . &quot;
well , okay , put your hand in here .
let &apos;s see how you like this waffle !
all right , settle down .
red light .
red light , red light !
okay , we &apos;re fine .
i &apos;m sorry .
i know it makes me sound like a bad person ,
but i just don &apos;t like children .
yeah , no , we all got that .
but don &apos;t you think it &apos;ll be different
when the child is ours ?
right , when it &apos;s our kid that &apos;s ruined my body
and kept me up all night and i &apos;ve got no career and no future
and nothing to be happy about for the next 20 years ,
sure , that &apos;ll be completely different .
well , yeah .
i don &apos;t think there &apos;s anything in this jewelry store
that amy would appreciate more
than the humidifier we were just looking at at sears .
oh , my god , now i know what i sound like to you
when i say stupid stuff .
ooh , a pocket watch .
okay , i don &apos;t think amy wants a pocket watch .
no , but maybe she wants a man with a pocket watch .
still saying stupid stuff .
does she like bracelets ?
well , she &apos;s very fond of her silver one
that says &quot; allergic to penicillin . &quot;
maybe they have a dressier version of that ?
well , how are we doing this afternoon ?
are we looking for anything special ?
perhaps a ring for the lady ?
trust me , we are not a couple .
excuse me .
i don &apos;t see why you get to snort derisively and point that out .
you &apos;d be lucky to land a fella like me .
fine , go ahead .
trust me , we are not a couple .
my apologies . how can i help you today ?
he &apos;s in trouble with his girlfriend
and needs to buy her a present .
great , trouble with girlfriends
is what &apos;s putting my daughter through usc .
ooh , are these real diamonds ?
yes . channel set baguettes , 20 points total weight .
remarkable .
diamonds , crystallized carbon .
every day , people go to the grocery store
and come home with sacks full of carbon
in the form of charcoal briquettes
that they toss in their barbeques and set on fire .
but just because you &apos;ve got some carbon
with the atoms stacked neatly ,
you expect me to plunk down thousands of dollars .
actually , that &apos;s only 750 .
everything &apos;s on sale .
really . talk to me about that pocket watch .
i &apos;m still trying to wrap my mind around it .
i always thought i &apos;d be a dad someday .
oh , me , too .
you &apos;re so caring .
i &apos;ve often pictured you guiding a young boy into manhood .
there you go , howard .
sounds like raj &apos;ll have your babies ; problem solved .
hey , just because a man shows caring for another man
doesn &apos;t mean he &apos;s displaying the love
that dare not speak its name .
did she definitely say she didn &apos;t want kids ?
yeah , she doesn &apos;t like them .
and from what i saw , the feeling was mutual .
what are you gonna do ?
i don &apos;t know .
i can &apos;t see a life where i don &apos;t have kids .
i mean , people have kids .
i mean , even donkey kong had donkey kong jr .
so he could teach someone how to kidnap princesses
皆为大金刚经典游戏内容
and throw barrels at italian plumbers .
you know , there &apos;s no guarantee even if you have kids
that you &apos;re going to like them .
wow , that &apos;s rough . where &apos;d you get that ?
it &apos;s right off the dust jacket of my mom &apos;s last book .
maybe me and bernadette aren &apos;t right for each other .
look , howard , i &apos;d say there &apos;s a lot of fish in the sea ,
but i watched you dangle your hook in the water for years .
do not throw her back .
i don &apos;t want to , but this is kind of a deal breaker .
what &apos;s your mom going to say if you call off the wedding ?
oh , it &apos;ll kill her .
on the other hand , if i don &apos;t give her grandchildren ,
that &apos;ll kill her , too .
so , either way , on the mom front , i &apos;m golden .
what time did you tell amy to be here ?
8 : 00 .
sheldon , that pocket watch is ridiculous .
nonsense .
i look like a train conductor .
under what pretext did you lure her here ?
i said , &quot; hey , want to come over and hang out ? &quot;
good , good , if you had said something clever ,
she might &apos;ve gotten suspicious .
what &apos;s he doing here ?
okay , he wants to talk to you .
well , i don &apos;t want to talk to him .
and i &apos;m pretty disappointed in you , too .
although we both know that won &apos;t last .
sheldon , you &apos;re up .
thank you .
amy , i &apos;d like to apologize .
your accomplishment was impressive .
and i &apos;m proud of you .
we both know that &apos;s your koala face .
i told you .
okay , look , he bought you this .
jewelry ?
seriously ?
sheldon , you are the most shallow ,
self @-@ centered person i have ever met .
do you really think another transparently manipul ...
oh , it &apos;s a tiara !
a tiara ! i have a tiara !
put it on me , put it on me , put it on me , put it on me ,
put it on me , put it on me , put it on me .
you look beautiful .
of course i do , i &apos;m a princess , and this is my tiara !
you were right , the tiara was too much .
howard ! bernadette &apos;s ...
oh , she slipped right by me .
here &apos;s your vest back .
you should keep it .
you could wear it again sometime .
where ?
i don &apos;t know , hunting ?
don &apos;t forget to talk to her about this mishegas
where i don &apos;t get grandkids !
don &apos;t worry , ma .
i will , as soon as i can figure out a way
to bring up such a sensitive issue !
i guess you talked to your mom , huh ?
i was upset .
my mom can be a pretty good shoulder to cry on ,
if the smell of bengay doesn &apos;t burn your eyes .
look , it &apos;s obvious having kids is really important to you ,
and i think i came up with a solution .
really ?
that &apos;s great . what ?
well , seeing as how i make way more money than you anyway ,
what if i work and you stay home with the kids ?
me ?
yeah .
you know , you &apos;ll watch barney
and pull cheerios out of their noses
and go on play dates ,
and i &apos;ll work and have conversations
with people my own age and enjoy my life .
yeah ...
yay , so we &apos;re good .
yeah , we &apos;re good .
you know , i don &apos;t know if this counted as a fight ,
but how about some make @-@ up sex ?
i would love that .
but what is that behind your ear ?
