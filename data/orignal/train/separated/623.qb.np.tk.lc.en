daddy !
when i was a child ,
my father was framed for a crime he didn &apos;t commit .
you &apos;re making a mistake !
amanda !
amanda clarke no longer exists .
before he died , he left a roadmap for revenge
that led me to the people who destroyed our lives .
why are you so interested in this girl ?
because she &apos;s interested in my son .
stay away from charlotte .
what do you think you &apos;re doing , bringing jack here ?
it &apos;s nice to see you again .
dad !
i want you to start following her .
something &apos;s not right here .
freeze ! don &apos;t move !
fbi !
let me go !
show me your hands !
stop resisting !
let go !
hands up !
check the upstairs !
amanda clarke .
how long did you really think you could fool me ?
you must be as stupid as your father .
get on the ground !
sammy .
what are you doing here ?
what &apos;s that ? what &apos;s this ?
you &apos;re such a good boy .
oh , good boy .
good boy .
ciao , margaret . how &apos;s italy ?
weren &apos;t you on the landmark preservation committee
last winter with michael davis ?
yes , just before he split with lydia .
come on .
do you remember a lovely young woman
by the name of emily thorne ?
she paid obscenely for the davis cottage next door ,
and you know how i can be about that kind of thing .
no , i don &apos;t want to keep you . you run .
all right , darling . bye .
i made you breakfast .
no . uh , i &apos;m not hungry .
you gotta eat , declan .
did you get any sleep ?
barely . uh ...
you know , every time i drifted off ...
dad was there .
and i &apos;d get up
to tell you the good news .
i stayed up till dawn ...
looking over dad &apos;s will .
the stowaway &apos;s all ours now .
and he didn &apos;t want a funeral .
he just wanted us to scatter his ashes at sea .
you know the last thing dad heard
was me calling him a loser ?
we both had a lot of fights with dad .
he knows you didn &apos;t mean it .
yeah , i did mean it .
scatter him without me .
good morning .
hey .
i found this old @-@ timer at my door last night .
i didn &apos;t even realize he was gone .
i &apos;m a little distracted .
my dad just passed away
from a heart attack .
oh , my god .
yeah .
that &apos;s awful .
is this him ?
i lost my dad suddenly , too .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i appreciate it .
let me , uh , let me make you some breakfast .
oh . it &apos;s the least i can do .
no , i @-@ i would-- i would love to , um ...
but i have this thing that i have to go do , so ...
maybe next time .
yeah .
take care of yourself .
yeah .
you , too .
okay .
what the hell are you doing here ?
risking death to prove i &apos;m still into you
and reminding you , you should still be into me .
you are so full of yourself .
come on . i could &apos;ve broken my neck climbing up here .
the least you could do is put on a bikini
and come watch me play volleyball .
get down .
charlotte , it &apos;s 11 : 00 .
yeah , mom . happens twice a day .
well , my meeting &apos;s starting right now ,
and it &apos;d be nice if you would put on
one of the dresses i bought you and made an appearance .
sorry . i already made plans .
outgrow this , please , i beg of you .
oh , and you might want to let adam know
that the drainpipe he scurried up
is in full view of the conservatory .
good morning , adam .
morning , mrs. grayson .
and in keeping with your husband &apos;s image ,
we &apos;re planning a sort of upscale barbecue .
are you sure the courtyard
can hold a hundred guests plus media ?
i mean , the senator loves his media .
mm . i know how much he covets the spotlight ,
but i promise you , there &apos;s enough room for everyone .
and if victoria says &quot; don &apos;t worry , &quot;
you can take that to the bank . mm .
speak of the devil . senator kingsly .
thank you .
how was the golf game ?
daniel spanked us old @-@ timers .
ah , lucky round .
steve , are we done here ? &apos; cause i &apos;d like
to get back to the hotel for a shower .
you should stay here .
oh , no . we &apos;d-- we &apos;d hate to impose .
nonsense . that &apos;s why we built this home .
isn &apos;t that right , victoria ?
well , all right , then . perfect .
all right . i &apos;ll send for your bags . and here .
i took another pass at your candidacy speech .
thanks , steve .
mrs. grayson , i &apos;m so sorry i &apos;m late .
i know you were counting on some of my ideas .
well , we &apos;ve already just wrapped , ms. thorne .
we managed to get it under control without you .
emily thorne .
it &apos;s nice to see you again , senator kingsly .
what a small world .
conrad , victoria ,
why didn &apos;t you tell me you knew emily ?
well , we &apos;ve only just met .
how do you two know each other ?
ms. thorne was a senior volunteer
in my first campaign .
and what was the name of the organization
you believe david clarke was laundering money for ?
the same americon initiative that claimed responsibility
for blowing up flight 197
last summer ?
did you come here to help me finish what i started ?
well , i &apos;m a big believer in finishing what you start .
then you have to stay for dinner .
well , it &apos;s summer in the hamptons .
i can &apos;t believe the young lady doesn &apos;t already have plans .
actually , she does .
with me .
well , there you have it .
excuse me .
moments ago ,
a jury found terrorist conspirator
david clarke guilty on all counts .
the case ,
spearheaded by federal prosecutor tom kinsgly ,
was a big win for both the united states
and the young attorney .
rumors are circulating
that a political career is in the not @-@ too @-@ distant future
for kingsly .
well , well , well .
if it isn &apos;t the thorne in everyone &apos;s side .
to what do i owe the pleasure ?
is it possible to hack a computer tablet
to run a powerpoint presentation ?
possible for you or possible for me ?
can you do it or not ?
with both hands tied behind my back
if you tell me why .
you don &apos;t need to know why .
fine .
get me the tablet &apos;s i.p. address
and i &apos;ll make it so you can run whatever program you want .
i already sent it . check your in @-@ box .
you &apos;re welcome , mary sunshine .
today i am just grateful
that justice prevailed
and that this terrible man has been held accountable
for his crimes against the american people .
as for the future , i have always planned
to serve my country ,
however and wherever it needs me most .
do you like the necklace ?
what woman wouldn &apos;t ?
i &apos;m just curious as to why
you &apos;re angrier today than you were yesterday .
because yesterday , i didn &apos;t have a house
full of unwanted guests .
wear the teal .
fine . you don &apos;t like tom &apos;s politics .
oh , i couldn &apos;t care less about his politics .
it &apos;s him i don &apos;t like .
well , he &apos;s done more for us than we &apos;ll ever
be able to do for him .
how could i ever forget ?
come on .
this will all be over before you know it ,
and then ...
we can go to paris for a few days , you know ?
whatever you like .
i want to make this right .
then you never should &apos;ve slept with my best friend .
just a second .
hi .
hey . oh , you look lovely .
thank you . you &apos;re punctual .
is that a bad thing ?
no , not at all . i &apos;ll just grab my stuff .
all set .
well , aren &apos;t you full of surprises ?
what can i say ? i live alone .
we should go shooting sometime .
we definitely should .
shall we ?
we shall .
my dad always said
that an empty bar is a sad bar .
he &apos;d be happy to see you all here today .
he might not have wanted a funeral ,
but he didn &apos;t say anything about a wake ,
so , everybody , drink up .
to carl porter .
to carl porter .
and , uh , in honor of jack and declan &apos;s father ,
next round &apos;s on me .
you didn &apos;t have to do that . you didn &apos;t even know my dad .
no , but ...
obviously , he &apos;s a--he &apos;s a good guy--
all these people drinking here to honor him .
when my dad bites it , people will be drinking to celebrate .
what can i get for you , man ?
uh , you know to make a malibu bay breeze ?
i do .
i would strongly advise against it .
it &apos;s more of a whiskey and beer crowd .
well ...
when in rome ...
ah , hey , sporty .
whose fist did you walk into ?
oh , some rich jerkwad .
there &apos;s a lot of &apos; em around this time of year .
you , uh , planning on getting even ?
considering i &apos;m half the guy &apos;s size
with half the friends , no .
violence is only one way to take someone down .
that &apos;s what i &apos;ve been saying .
the family values crowd would eat that up .
well , then here &apos;s to family values .
and the passage of the kingsly finance bill .
when i &apos;m reelected ,
it &apos;s my first order of business .
all this talk of politics .
believe me , i &apos;m used to it .
what a lovely necklace , victoria .
thank you .
excuse me .
i &apos;m expecting an e @-@ mail from the majority leader .
it &apos;ll just ...
i &apos;m sorry .
steve , please come with me .
excuse me .
oh , man . you &apos;ve gotta be kidding me .
find out where this came from .
now .
everything all right , senator ?
welcome to tuscany .
thank you .
what is this place ? looks interesting .
it &apos;s an italian steak house . ashley turned me on to it .
red leather booths and everything .
too old @-@ school ?
not at all .
just ... would &apos;ve guessed you
more sushi bar than steak house .
the bloodier the better .
could you excuse me for a second ?
yeah .
excuse me .
hi . um , i &apos;m at that table over there in the middle ,
and i don &apos;t have a steak knife .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;ll bring you one .
okay . thanks .
hey , can we get a bottle of sparkling water , please ?
what the hell are you doing here ?
patrick , i @-@ i had no idea ...
i &apos;m ...
whoa . wait here . patrick .
patrick , stop .
stop ! patrick !
patrick .
look , i know how pissed you are , okay ?
and you have every right to be .
but you have no idea
how sorry i am about everything that happened .
you happened , grayson .
and if you were man enough
to take responsibility for what you did ,
you wouldn &apos;t be apologizing to me .
you &apos;d be apologizing to my sister .
it &apos;s a video of you walking into a building .
what &apos;s the big deal ?
you &apos;ve got another one .
i gather that &apos;s not your niece .
what on earth is going on here ?
oh , more politics , i &apos;m afraid .
trouble with the majority leader ?
i didn &apos;t want to bore you with this .
david clarke is innocent , and i can prove it .
tell the judge and have him call back the jury .
they &apos;re already in deliberations .
and now you &apos;re telling me , you committed perjury ?
don &apos;t believe her . she &apos;s in love with him .
what the hell is going on here ?
what &apos;s going on here is , you &apos;ve just argued
an airtight case against the most hated man in america
and when the jury convicts him ,
you &apos;re gonna be an instant national hero .
your political future , tom , is wide open ,
and you have a powerful supporter in me .
now if you decide to listen to my wife ,
who &apos;s foolishly fallen in love with that monster ,
you &apos;re gonna throw all that away .
it &apos;s your call .
what &apos;s the crisis ?
there is no crisis .
just a little situation .
frank .
victoria .
you and diane go ahead and finish dinner without us .
it might take a little while .
rest assured , we &apos;re gonna take care of it .
don &apos;t you always ?
thanks
i &apos;m ... i &apos;m sorry you had to see that .
but in a way , i &apos;m also glad it happened .
you have a right to know what you &apos;re getting into .
well , what am i getting into ?
i mean , who was that guy ?
patrick munello .
i dated his sister last summer .
her name &apos;s sara .
so you break the sister &apos;s heart ,
and then big brother breaks your car ?
actually , i broke her spine .
oh , my god .
she wasn &apos;t paralyzed , thank god , but , you know ,
it &apos;s still a struggle for her .
how did that happen ?
my mom , as you know , has a lot of expectations .
her son dating a cocktail waitress from portsmouth
not one of them .
so towards the end of the summer ,
my mom made her feelings public at one of her parties .
and i took off with sara , drunk .
wrapped my car around a utility pole ,
and ... they had to cut us both out .
so where is she now ?
still in rehab last i heard .
i haven &apos;t spoken to her since that night .
my parents covered sara &apos;s medical bills
and set her up so she wouldn &apos;t have to worry ,
paid a judge off to keep me out of jail ,
and in return , i had to swear i &apos;d never see her again .
it sounds like you regret that now .
every day .
do you think i &apos;m a bad person ?
i think ...
people who make mistakes should own up to them .
you should go talk to her .
tell her what you &apos;re telling me now .
when did the affair end ?
february , but on good terms .
i don &apos;t believe she &apos;d be behind this .
then it can be managed .
if it comes out , you both deny it .
candidates survive this sort of thing all the time .
you &apos;re not telling us the whole story .
shortly before we decided to move on ,
erin got pregnant .
we talked about it , and she decided not to have the baby .
i sent her the money to take care of it .
you know the senator &apos;s politics on the issue .
if it gets out , he &apos;s done .
more importantly , my wife would be devastated .
well , then we have to make it so that it doesn &apos;t get out .
every bait and tackle shop
needs a web site , brother .
uh , hey , uh , jack ,
could-- could we get another round over here ?
i &apos;m uploading this gentleman into the 21st century .
the only thing i &apos;m uploading is you into a cab .
no , that &apos;s okay .
you know what ?
i &apos;ll throw my bike in the trunk and i can drive him home .
all right .
thanks , friend .
this is a cool place .
be it ever so humble ...
what do i owe you for this random act of kindness ?
and i never carry cash , by the way .
man , i don &apos;t want your money .
maybe you could tell me what you meant earlier .
you know , about , uh ...
ways to get even .
an emerging specialty of mine .
allow me .
what &apos;s the guy &apos;s name who trashed your face ?
adam something .
he &apos;s a friend of charlotte grayson &apos;s .
watch and learn , grasshopper .
adam connor ?
yeah .
i was just accessed his webcam , and ...
now you &apos;re free to record his most ...
intimate moments
and use them as you will .
charlotte grayson .
and it seems we have struck gold
our first time out .
yeah , um , she had nothing to do with it , right ?
whatever you say .
can i borrow that ?
keep it .
it &apos;s yours .
thanks .
the night after kingsly
presented his closing arguments ,
victoria managed to get a note to me .
&quot; my dear david ,
i am so horrified by what &apos;s happened to you ,
and i know how betrayed you feel .
i can &apos;t tell you everything in a letter ,
but i &apos;m going to kingsly in the morning
with evidence that will exonerate you .
by this time tomorrow ,
the judge will have declared a mistrial ,
and this nightmare will be behind you ,
behind both of us .
forgive me . &quot;
whatever victoria said to kingsly ,
it didn &apos;t change his mind .
after only one day of deliberations ,
the jury convicted me on all counts .
&quot; with friends like the graysons ,
kingsly will probably wind up president someday .
no , no , no , no , no .
the large arrangements go on the bar ,
and the smaller ones go on the table .
has anyone seen the a.v. guy ?
is everything under control ?
absolutely .
good . i want to check the seating arrangements .
did i make a mistake ?
oh , no , no . i &apos;m just always changing my mind .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
please tell me you &apos;re the a.v. guy .
i wish i could .
tyler barrol ,
daniel &apos;s roommate at harvard .
now i see why he comes home for the summer .
tyler .
well , it &apos;s finally nice to put a face to the name .
you must be charlotte .
you &apos;re cute .
daniel didn &apos;t mention that you were coming .
oh , total impulse . i hope it &apos;s not too much of an intrusion .
well , he took off early this morning ,
god knows where ,
but you &apos;re perfectly welcome
to make yourself at home at the pool house if you wish .
thank you , mrs. grayson .
would you be a dear , and show him the way ?
of course .
i &apos;m sorry , but i didn &apos;t catch your name .
i didn &apos;t give it to you .
the pool house is that way , next to the pool .
hey .
hey .
just , uh , yeah , just leave those right there .
your tips from last night are in that envelope .
nolan was extra generous .
yeah , tell me about it . he gave me , uh ...
he gave me a laptop for driving him home .
he &apos;s big into buying friends .
he &apos;s got the money . he might as well use it .
hey , listen , i was , um ,
i was thinking of closing up early and ...
i &apos;m gonna go pick up dad &apos;s ashes .
you should come with me .
no , no . i already told you , no .
look ...
i don &apos;t get it , man .
dad broke his back for both of us his entire life ,
and he loved you , declan .
you already made one mistake you &apos;re gonna regret
for the rest of your life .
do you have to make it two ?
you know what ?
just &apos; cause he &apos;s dead doesn &apos;t make you my father .
you have a minute ?
i do .
aren &apos;t you busy cleaning up after the senator ?
daniel went to see sara at the rehab center today .
he knows he &apos;s forbidden .
why i thought you might like to know .
strange thing ...
is that emily drove him .
what is this girl up to ?
you really don &apos;t trust her , do you ?
trust is the one luxury i cannot afford .
i think she &apos;s threason that michael left lydia .
and i intend to prove it tonight at the fund @-@ raiser .
how ?
by putting emily next to him .
one look at the two of them together ,
and i &apos;ll know .
clearly , someone has to step in
before my son makes another mistake .
is it done ?
this is some of my best work , if i do say so .
uploading the program to the good senator &apos;s tablet ...
now .
the second he opens that god @-@ awful speech ,
the program will initiate .
you better be right .
i thought you were in italy for the summer .
i was , but my parents were all over me about my resume .
i gotta get serious about an internship .
well , in the meantime , you &apos;re welcome
to crash here for a bit .
you sure your parents won &apos;t mind ?
his parents won &apos;t mind at all .
but it &apos;s nice of you to ask .
thanks , mrs. grayson .
daniel , a word ?
uh , i &apos;ll go see
if your party planner needs a hand .
her name &apos;s ashley , in case you were wondering .
you broke our agreement .
you went to see that girl sara .
how do you know that ?
well , at least you &apos;re not denying it .
i went to apologize , mom .
something i should &apos;ve done a long time ago .
and for what it &apos;s worth ,
she wasn &apos;t exactly forgiving ,
so ... at least now i can move on .
with emily thorne ?
you got a problem with her , too ?
at least you know she &apos;s not a gold digger .
the only thing we know for sure
is that you &apos;re a bad judge of women .
i &apos;m asking you to take it slow
till we know more about her .
no one &apos;s ever gonna be good enough for you , are they ?
nonsense . i want you to be happy .
oh , like you and dad ?
it &apos;s for your own protection .
daniel tells me you &apos;re at the top of the class .
you play golf ?
uh , yeah , well , i &apos;ve been giving it my all , sir .
i can certainly put you
in touch with a good pro . emily .
you look stunning .
thank you , mr. grayson .
hello , emily .
mrs. grayson . have either of you seen daniel ?
oh , i &apos;m sure he &apos;s around somewhere .
have you met his roommate from harvard ?
tyler .
nice to meet you .
pleasure .
that &apos;s a beautiful dress , charlotte .
it &apos;s total kate middleton .
oh , what could be wrong with that ?
excuse me .
what are you doing here , nolan ?
evening , kitten .
as you know , i &apos;m a big contributor
to the good senator &apos;s campaign .
i just thought i &apos;d show up and ...
see what i &apos;m contributing to .
the fun police .
is he bothering you again ?
like a swarm of gnats .
so what &apos;d you think of daniel &apos;s friend tyler ?
i think you &apos;re clearly interested .
why should you get to have all the fun ?
hey . could we take a walk ?
yeah . is everything okay ?
yeah .
i &apos;ll see you in a bit .
hello again ...
ashley .
hello .
where are you ?
i &apos;m dying over here .
i &apos;m not big on politics .
adam , these are the sacrifices you make
when you &apos;re trying to win someone back .
call me as soon as it &apos;s over .
so what &apos;s up ?
you didn &apos;t happen to mention to anyone about sara ?
no , not at all . why ?
i swear , my mom &apos;s having me followed .
what ? that is-- that &apos;s so creepy .
listen , i &apos;m sorry if i overstepped or--
no , no , no . i &apos;m glad that you did .
it was the right thing to do .
you know , seeing sara again made me realize that
i have to start taking control of my life again ,
standing up to my parents .
well , in that case , i &apos;m glad i could help .
no matter what happens between us ,
or what my mother says or does ,
and if me and you last a week , a year , ten years ,
forever ...
i &apos;ll always be honest with you .
okay . have a wonderf time .
michael .
oh . well , how fit you look .
thanks . i , uh , finally got back to the gym .
victoria , i was surprised to get your call .
i figured lydia had successfully
poisoned the well with you .
our divorce has really brought out the worst in her .
well , it &apos;s brought out the worst in both our spouses ,
i &apos;m afraid , but ...
it &apos;s water under the bridge , right ?
right .
lydia isn &apos;t here , is she ?
heavens no .
okay .
but there are a good number of people
that i know are going to be thrilled to see you .
as a matter of fact , i &apos;ve seated you next to someone
i believe you know very well .
michael ...
you remember emily ?
you do look familiar ?
wait .
you were on the landmark preservation committee together .
that &apos;s right . of course . it &apos;s good to see you .
and emily bought your beach house .
yes , i did .
emily thorne . right , of course .
there you are .
hey . i got lost coming back from the bathroom .
cameron , hi .
emily . wow .
it &apos;s been ages .
i &apos;m sorry . we haven &apos;t been introduced .
oh , i &apos;m sorry . victoria , cameron lang .
she &apos;s , uh ... my plus one .
cameron also worked on the presvation committee .
technically , emily was the one who introduced us .
did she now ?
i &apos;d like to introduce you to a man
i &apos;ve been proud to call my friend
for the past 15 years .
he &apos;s a man who represents
everything this country should be--
honorable , passionate ,
and conservative .
please welcome senator tom kingsly .
thank you , conrad .
and thank you , victoria ,
for hosting this auspicious event at your home .
what &apos;s going on ?
i don &apos;t know .
oh , my god .
i , uh ...
i came here tonight to announce
that i will not be seeking reelection this fall ...
as i am retiring from public life .
i &apos;ll see to it your contributions are returned .
i &apos;m very sorry .
she claims that you invited her , senator .
that &apos;s a lie .
where is she ?
with security .
she said you &apos;ve been
texting and e @-@ mailing her for the past month ,
wiring money to take care of the baby ,
even told her you &apos;d leave your wife .
then she said you sent her a red dress and a plane ticket
to be here tonight .
that doesn &apos;t make any sense .
what does she stand to gain by forcing my resignation ?
your opponent could &apos;ve paid her .
or a jealous staffer with access to your correspondence
could &apos;ve set the whole thing up .
what ? that &apos;s insane .
tom , i have dedicated my entire career to you
tom . what &apos;s going on ?
oh , you have no idea how much work i put into this event .
i &apos;m so sorry .
but it was a really great party , considering .
speaking of parties ...
believe me , i would like to hammer all of those ,
but i have a major mess to clean up .
rain check ?
count on it .
what about you two lovebirds ?
oh , no . don &apos;t tell me you &apos;re gonna bail on me , too .
you know i don &apos;t drink anymore .
oh , come on .
i mean , after tonight , you can make an exception .
i @-@ i don &apos;t think so .
but look on the bright side-- you can party all summer ,
and i &apos;ll be your designated driver .
yeah ? well , then let &apos;s get started . where to ?
actually , i &apos;m exhausted , but you guys go .
have fun .
you sure ?
see you soon .
night .
let &apos;s talk .
drive safely now .
well , i &apos;m stunned .
you never can tell with people , can you ?
indeed .
good night , emily .
good night , mrs. grayson .
actually ...
would you mind terribly
if i started calling you victoria ?
of course .
then good night , victoria .
go away , nolan .
i have to know . how did you do it ?
how &apos;d you get your hands on a sex tape ?
i bought the building that his mistress lives in .
as part of the renovations , i had cameras installed .
that &apos;s commitment .
uh , and now ?
i release the videos to the press .
why ?
you already got what you wanted .
you destroyed a man &apos;s career .
i want to destroy his life .
if he had done the right thing ,
he would &apos;ve saved my father .
he chose not to ,
so down he goes .
along with his family .
you scare me .
good .
uh , check out that sunset .
only thing missing is you .
call me sometime .
okay .
ciao .
again ?
i &apos;m so sorry .
maybe he &apos;s trying to tell me something .
maybe he &apos;s ... worried about you
after what happened to your father .
maybe , yeah .
i wish you could &apos;ve met him .
it &apos;s his final request .
where &apos;s your brother ?
didn &apos;t show .
i &apos;m on my own .
well , not entirely .
yeah .
the &quot; amanda &quot; ?
yeah . sammy named her .
thanks for bringing him back to me ...
again .
sammy .
come on . come on .
for the innocent ,
the past may hold a reward .
but for the treacherous ...
it &apos;s only a matter of time before the past delivers
what they truly deserve .
the kingslys have decided
to avoid the spotlight for the time being .
that &apos;s probably best .
you should know that i located the i.p. address
all those e @-@ mails came from .
unfortunately , it &apos;s a little late .
the damage has already been done .
they came from right here .
my laptop ?
well , i sure as hell didn &apos;t do it .
not you .
someone with real motive
and access .
i got you something .
i love them .
you promise me , when you wear them ,
that you think of me .
always .
let me see .
god , you &apos;re so beautiful .
listen , i &apos;m sorry if i overstepped or--
no , no , no . i &apos;m glad that you did .
it was the right thing to do .
you know , seeing sara again made me realize that
i have to start taking control of my life again ,
standing up to my parents .
well , in that case , i &apos;m glad i could help .
no matter what happens between us ,
or what my mother says or does ,
and if me and you last a week , a year , ten years ,
forever ...
i &apos;ll always be honest with you .
okay . have a wonderf time .
michael .
oh . well , how fit you look .
thanks . i , uh , finally got back to the gym .
victoria , i was surprised to get your call .
i figured lydia had successfully
poisoned the well with you .
our divorce has really brought out the worst in her .
well , it &apos;s brought out the worst in both our spouses ,
i &apos;m afraid , but ...
it &apos;s water under the bridge , right ?
