What are you doing up so early?
I couldn't sleep.
You want breakfast?
Yeah, all right.
Anthony.
What?
I am making French toast.
I'm not hungry. Jesus, how many times you gonna ask me?
You've heard the term comfort food. Maybe it'll make you feel better.
This is hard to believe,
but food may not be the answer to every problem.
Neither is acting like a whiny bitch.
Tony.
I'll eat at work, OK?
My shitty-ass pizza job.
If it's so horrible, take a day off.
My fiance left me.
That job is all I have in my life.
It's better to have loved and lost, AJ.
What?
It is.
I feel bad for him
but why's he gotta take it out on us?
I'm looking for a mitre saw.
I got the Makita, carbide blade, laser guide.
Lists for 6... 200.
Sold.
Mike, you got that?
Yeah.
Cheese it. It's the off-duty cops.
You know my son-in-law Chris, the movie producer?
Let me know about that ticket.
Forget it.
Thanks. How you doing? How's my little girl?
Good. You coming Sunday?
Two o'clock, she said.
For you. Tell your friend Paulie
to keep these power tools coming.
Those fucking belt sanders flying off the shelves, huh?
You ain't seen this many cops lined up
since the centennial of Dunkin' Donuts.
They're all handymen.
They got side jobs
so they can afford those 18-foot boats.
Cataldo, the state tropper,
is putting a drop ceiling in my basement.
Thanks, sweetie.
1.2K in there. I took my cut.
I'm seeing Al again next week.
To business.
You jinxing me? Toast with water?
It's club soda. What's your problem?
You got the problem. You're a real fucking drip lately.
When I was using, I was a disgrace.
Now I'm sober and I'm a drip.
The fuck you want?
How's about being normal? That so hard?
Actually, yeah, Paulie,
for some of us it is.
Don't get cunty. I'm breaking your balls.
What do you say we take a ride?
Little prime rib? On me.
Maybe next time.
You watching your cholesterol too?
Yeah. You're fucking hilarious.
Hey, Tony. What's the good word?
Can't complain.
Sure you could. Phil Leotardo.
My first assignment out of the Academy was in Brooklyn.
Never cared for him.
He tried to set up this other rookie, female, for rape and beating.
Listen, that subject we talked about...
If I was to know
something possibly terror-related
and help you out,
could I bank the resulting goodwill?
Well,
what happens is
I would personally write you what's called a 5K letter.
It's a document setting forth your cooperation and service
This letter would be placed in your file
and if you were ever convicted of a crime
it'd be presented to a judge
when he or she
would be considering sentencing guidelines.
Well, there were a couple of guys,
I don't know, Arabs, Arabians maybe.
They used to hang around the Bing
and somebody I knew
may have did some business with them.
At the port?
You were saying.
They used to be around all the time.
Drinking
and trying to tit-fuck the girls, whatever.
And then suddenly they disappeared,
and I mean completely.
A week or so ago
I'm driving
and I see 'em with these other guys.
The headgear and the beard
and the whole fundamental bit.
But there's nothing illegal there, right?
What were they doing?
Walking.
But then they meet up with this other group.
I don't know, it seemed...
You got a name?
One was named Ahmad
or Jamal...
Hold on, hold on.
Hey, T.
Yeah, I'm here with some people.
The Arabs from the Bing, what were their names?
Some people?
Exactly.
Oh, fuck, yeah. Ahmed and Mohammed.
What did they do?
Ahmed and Mohammed.
You know, actually, I got a cell number.
I called him recently but he don't answer no more.
Ahmed al Najafi.
973-555-01.46.
Ahmed al Najafi.
Tell me they're not gonna blow up the chemical plant
or some shit.
I don't know. I'll call you later.
Cellphone.
That's a real prize.
Thank you.
So finally I said, "OK,
as long as you don't mind yesterday's pizza."
"No, no," he said, "it's cool."
"So great," I told him. "Come back tomorrow."
You are so bad.
Hey.
Hey, how you doing?
Who's that?
I don't know. Some guy.
What are you, going out with him?
He smiled, Anthony.
He works here.
You gotta stop.
Or what?
Or I won't see you again.
Like meeting me is such a big deal?
I don't think it's a good idea.
How come?
Cos last time you started crying and had to leave the Starbucks.
I can't sleep at night without you.
lt'll get better, OK?
I love you so much.
I gotta go back to work.
Stop. You're embarrassing me.
You knock off early, we go back to your place,
christen those new sheets you told me about.
A man with a plan, huh?
The man with the erection.
Let me take this.
Hey.
It's me.
I need you to come home. It's AJ.
What happened?
I am worried, Tony.
I have never seen him like this.
I'm supposed to see a new property
but I am afraid to leave him alone.
Afraid, why?
Will you just come home, please?
Go away.
It's me.
What's the matter?
What happened?
You know what happened.
Blanca still?
All right, that's it. Enough's enough.
Look, I'm fucking depressed, OK?
You broke up. How long you want to cry about it?
She was my life.
You're 20 years old. You barely have a life.
And you're better off anyway.
She was cute, OK,
but come on. With another guy's kid to boot.
She was the best thing that ever happened to me.
What you're going through,
what you're feeling right now,
it happens sometimes.
Everybody gets the blues.
There's a half-a-billion-dollar industry devoted to it.
What, Prozac?
No, the music business.
They write thousands of songs about this shit.
Tears On My Pillow,
Mona Lisa, right?
Listen, these fucking women,
they'll drive you nuts with your emotions and whatnot.
I know it feels like
you'll never love anybody again.
But trust me, there's millions of girls out there
that are dying to meet a guy like you.
I see 'em every day.
Right, I'm so special.
Damn right you are.You're handsome and smart
and a hard worker
and, let's be honest, white.
That's a huge plus nowadays.
Go out and get a blow job.
I don't want a blow job.
Keep your voice down.
Why?
Who's listening?
Nobody.
Oh, fuck me!
You saw her again, didn't you?
I knew it.
I don't wanna talk about it.
I love you, Anthony. It's killing me to see you like this.
What's the fucking point?
Point of what?
Just leave me alone.
Honestly, I was glad when they broke up.
The culture divide... But now...
Everything turns to shit.
Thank you so much for inviting us.
I'm so nervous cooking for all these people.
Do you remember Tony's sister Barbara?
Of course.
Hi.
Her husband Tom, Stefan, Alyssa.
This is for you.
Thank you.
And the baby.
Come in. Come in.
Can I play the Xbox?
What happened to folding the napkins?
How you holding up?
I'm freaking.
I gotta take the ziti out.
You OK, T?
You having a good time?
Yeah.
So it could be good. Got a lot of money in this.
Look at that wrist action.
All those years yanking
it finally starting to pay off.
That non-alcoholic shit any good?
It's all right.
Less filling, tastes like ass.
This is nice.
About time you invited everybody over.
It was Kelli's idea.
She's been wanting to start entertaining.
Good thing, else I'd never see you.
What are you talking about?
Steak's done.
You think so?
It keeps cooking even if it's off the flame.
The juices.
So what's up with you?
You've been like a ghost lately.
You're around, then you're gone.
I was by the Bing the other day.
For five minutes.
You know, you of all people should understand how hard it is
for me to be around that place.
I should? Why?
Cos you're in therapy.
You understand the human condition, at least.
Still doing that?
Turn those ribs.
Between the booze and the strippers over there,
half of them are fucking cokeheads.
It's hard, you know?
And Satriale's, that fridge full of beer.
It's tough to eat a sausage and peppers
without a cold one.
So then just quit. You want a beer, too bad.
Show some balls.
I got balls.
I can't eat eggplant cos of my stomach.
Might put me into a relapse.
Now, believe me, I'd like to, but I don't.
It's not that simple.
Make it simple.
It's a disease.
I inherited it. You know the problem with my mother.
I gotta be honest. This whole disease concept,
I think it's bullshit.
So you know more than the scientists?
I know a crutch when I see it.
So my dad?
You must have knew he had a crutch.
What the fuck are you talking about? - Come on, Tone.
Between the coke, the vodka,
whatever else he was squirting up his arm...
Let's be honest about the great Dickie Moltisanti.
My dad, your hero...
wasn't much more than a fucking junkie.
Hey, don't fucking move!
Easy.
What the fuck is going on?
Paulie, remember? Germani.
We met at your granddaughter's christening.
What the fuck are you doing?
My uncle didn't call you?
No...
Who's your uncle?
Paulie Gaultieri.
These are for his friend at the union.
What union?
He was supposed to call you. You believe this?
Al, this is a big fucking mix-up.
I thought Paulie called you.
The guy's waiting.
So you break in?
I got a silent alarm that goes to my house.
He'll take care of you.
Let me talk to my son-in-law.
Chris?
If I were you I wouldn't make a problem where there ain't one.
Take over, OK, Felix?
What you do?
I'm leaving. - Who?
I'm going home, all right? I quit.
Why you do that?
If Dale calls, just tell him I'm sorry.
But you're the manager.
Tone, hey.
Hey.
How you doing?
This always helps.
God bless the NFL.
I tell you, I owe a spot of it to my son.
I was against this kid even going to college.
Once him and Carlo's kid started taking action on campus,
far as I'm concerned, he should stay till he gets a PhD.
Benefits of a higher education.
Don't get me wrong. He's learning stuff too.
The shit this kid knows about computers...
He set his mother up with a website
for her ceramics business.
You must be very proud.
Believe me, I thank God every day.
I gotta take a leak.
Parisi the younger. I was just talking to your dad about you.
What did I do now?
To hear him, you're the golden boy.
Hey, Tone.
What the fuck's with you?
Root canal. They got me on Oxycodone.
My whole fucking head is numb.
That answers a lot of questions.
What the fuck are you laughing at?
I'll see you inside, Tone. I got something for you.
So how's Rutgers?
You see those envelopes?
Majoring in cash, minoring in ass.
Things change, huh?
When I was in college, it wasn't so much sports betting.
Hey, how's AJ doing?
Good.
He's working. Broke up with that girlfriend of his.
That Spanish chick?
He took her to my cousin's wedding.
She was smoking, that girl.
Yeah, you know, whatever.
He didn't want to get too serious.
Fuck, Jay, check it out
Holy shit.
So Sil tells me
you booked a party here next week.
Yeah, it's our frat.
You should call AJ.
He's probably busy but he'd love to see you guys.
Absolutely.
Definitely.
Who is it?
Me.
How you doing, kid?
What the fuck, Paulie?
I left you four messages.
My flight was delayed. I just got in.
And I've been dealing with Al for two days.
Just tell him to relax.
They busted into his store. His acid reflux is acting up.
He woke up Kelli, got her all upset.
It's my fault he's a crybaby?
They told him I'd take care of him.
What's his problem?
I'm stupid now?
You know and I know they were there to boost that shit.
It couldn't wait.
I promised a load to Lenny at the joint-fitters' union.
What do I care? It ain't my union.
Lower your voice. I got neighbours.
Fuck them. When you gonna pay me?
When you suck the money out of my ass. Now get the fuck out!
Listen, I gotta talk to you.
Now?
It can't wait, T. This fucking Paulie!
What happened?
He sent his idiot nephew and Jason Molinaro
to my father-in-law's store.
They boosted a pallet of power saws.
They did?
Yeah.
Not exactly. Al caught 'em.
So they did or did not take the saws?
They did under false pretence.
This is what you had to talk to me about?
They broke into the guy's store, T!
Yeah, I hear you. I get it.
But we're talking about
a potentially multimillion-dollar proposition here
It ain't the money, Tone.
Really? Well, I'm glad you feel that way.
A pallet of drills. You believe this shit?
Go have a lime rickey or whatever you're drinking these days,
and we'll be done in a minute.
Forget it, all right? I got other shit to do.
Come in.
I need to talk to you guys.
What's the matter? Finn?
What? No.
It's not about me. AJ.
I know he's upset,
but he's been saying some things that are really disturbing.
Like what?
Like nobody gives a shit about him.
What's the point of anything? Stuff like that.
I told you about
that girl Hadley in my dorm sophomore year,
the one who threw herself off the library balcony.
These are the kind of things she was saying.
I don't mean to get you all upset...
Of course not. I'm glad you said something.
Good night.
Good night, sweetie.
Get some sleep.
I came here today to tell you
in all seriousness that I'm done.
I did what you said.
I gave it a lot of thought
and I decided that, once and for all,
it's over.
The truth is,
this therapy is a jerk-off.
You know it and I know it.
I actually don't know it,
but please continue.
It's a jerk-off.
Yes, you've said that.
I was coming here to quit.
Had it all planned out. But guess what.
My son is talking suicide.
So now I'm trapped here forever.
My God, what did he say?
His girlfriend, fiance, whatever,
she broke up with him.
He's beyond devastated.
Shall I recommend someone for him to talk to?
Carmela's getting a referral from his own paediatrician.
After that incompetent
you sent Meadow to?
So I suppose now comes the grilling
about how I feel about all this.
Isn't that why you're here?
Friends of mine, they got sons his age
and they're happy,
ambitious.
They fucking take life as it comes.
I know it seems that way,
but do you really know these other boys?
I know what I see,
my son curled up on the couch
when he should be banging coeds.
Have you talked to him?
Till I'm blue in the face.
We both have, and now we're afraid to talk to him
because of what he might do.
Obviously I'm prone to depression,
a certain bleak attitude about the world,
but I know I can handle it.
Your kids, though,
it's like when they're little
and they get sick,
you'd give anything to trade places with them
so they don't have to suffer.
And then to think you're the cause of it.
How are you the cause of it?
It's in his blood, this miserable fucking existence.
My rotten fucking putrid genes
have infected my kid's soul.
That's my gift to my son.
I know this is difficult.
But I'm very glad we're having this discussion.
Really?
Cos I gotta be honest. I think it fucking sucks.
What does?
Therapy, this.
I hate this fucking shit!
We're both adults here, right?
So after all is said
and done,
after all the complaining and the crying
and all the fucking bullshit,
is this all there is?
Yes. Welcome.
Hi, I'm Chris. I'm an alcoholic and drug addict.
Hi, Chris.
I want to go back to what Stan said.
How not being able to socialise is hard
when you're a salesman.
In my case, it's the same thing.
It's actually taking food out of my daughter's mouth.
My boss, for all his bullshit encouragement,
how he respects what I'm doing,
the reality is he resents my sobriety.
I had the same thing at Unicor.
They were all on board for the intervention
but skip one golf outing and you're ostracised.
He's an enabler too, the worst fucking kind.
Pours you a drink with one hand,
judges you with the other if you take it.
And he wonders why I'm distant,
why I wanna branch out into other things.
But I can promise you I'd have more money,
plus more responsibility,
if I sat with him drinking,
watching that Scotch
drool out of his fat fucking mouth.
Hey.
What are you watching?
Nothing.
That's a good one.
John Wayne.
Two Jasons call you?
Invite you to a party tomorrow night?
I don't know.
Well, either they did or they didn't.
Yeah, I guess.
Jason Gervasi called.
What did you tell him?
I didn't call him back.
How come?
Cos I don't want to go.
Of course not. Beer, strippers,
fucking around with guys your own age,
you hate that shit.
You gonna call him?
I said I don't want to go.
I know you don't want to go.
You don't want to work, you don't want to eat,
you don't want to talk either.
So, all that being the case,
you're gonna shower tomorrow night,
you're gonna get dressed, you're gonna go to that party.
I'm not gonna debate you on this.
Fine.
Your boss is your uncle?
Once removed.
That's gotta add to the source.
We used to be so tight.
And producing movies is high-stress enough.
I have a happy marriage.
But there was a woman...
She worked with us in a club we had.
Anyway, she became a problem to deal with
and
I sided with him.
She was out of my life.
OK, fine.
But he never appreciated it.
Give, give, give, it's all I ever do.
I think that's when the relationship between me and him
got poisoned.
How's it going?
Al here?
You just missed him. He went to lunch.
Can I help you?
We're here for the drills.
What drills?
You know, in the back.
I know what you mean but Al didn't mention picking anything up.
This fucking guy.
Get him on the phone.
All right.
What's your name?
Me? I'm Mike.
Paulie.
Nice to meet you.
Voicemail.
Give me that.
Yeah, Al, it's Paulie.
Listen, we're here with Mike.
We're taking the drills.
I'll call you about that other order.
Let's go.
What's her name?
Blanca.
Had you and Blanca been engaged long?
Only a couple of weeks.
She had a son too,
from when she used to be married.
What do you think went wrong?
Her husband was an asshole, supposedly.
With your relationship?
I don't know.
I mean, I wish there was a reason, but
she says there isn't.
I think maybe it's because we have way more money in my family than hers.
They're immigrants,
and that might have scared her.
Have you been feeling suicidal, Anthony?
A little bit.
Have you ever tried to kill yourself?
No.
I mean, once me and my friends
jumped off my garage roof,
but, you know, that was just to fool around.
You sleeping a lot?
I'm tired,
but I keep waking up.
Nightmares?
I just keep thinking about her.
I mean, it hurts,
but I can't help it.
Does anything in life give you pleasure lately?
I don't know.
Not really.
There's a medication called Lexapro.
It's an antidepressant.
I have friends who take that.
Well, I'm going to write you a prescription.
I'm making mad fucking money, bro.
I gotta shut my phone off sometimes.
You should totally do it, man.
I'm not really good with betting and percentages.
I got like a 450 on my math SAT.
Fuck that shit. I could hook you up in ten minutes.
Can I dance for you, baby?
I guess.
Yeah, dude!
Yeah!
Look at this pile of shit.
Yeah, so get some toilet paper.
What is that, comedy?
Actually, yeah.
Come on, what are you gonna do?
Fuck it, I'm all in.
Fucking idiot. Toilet paper?
Fucking cunt!
Fuck!
Chris!
You were my friend.
Fuck!
Call an ambulance!
Tony, wake up. I need to talk to you.
What?
You let our underage son go to a party at a strip club?
What time is it?
Take it easy, will you? What's the big deal?
He got in three hours ago.
He is still drunk and he's not even drinking age.
Yet he could die in lraq.
What's that got to do with anything?
Jesus Christ, Carm, he's gonna be 21 in two months.
He's an emotional wreck, Tony.
So seeing a pair of tits is gonna send him over the edge?
Got him out, around people his own age.
At the fucking Bing?
They're college kids. It's what they do.
You'd rather see him in his room drinking cocoa
but this is the way back,
believe me, and the way back to college,
fraternities, frat boys.
Hey.
I did a stupid thing, Tone. I won't deny it.
Stupid? Just hung up with Paulie.
His nephew's got six broken vertebraes.
I know that and I'm sorry.
But this is the second fucking time
Paulie flouted his authority to my face.
This shit with the tools,
I know he set up the deal with the Cubans,
but this is my father-in-law we're talking about, my family.
This bullshit could have been handled with a conversation.
I came to the Bing. I tried to talk to you about it.
And I told you to wait and you left
to go God-knows-where.
I got to be honest,
I can't help thinking that
this goes directly to what we talked about.
If you were around more,
problems like this would be squashed in the womb.
Whether I'm around's got nothing to do with it.
He needed the tools, he could have left me a message.
We're supposed to leave phone messages
about interstate hijacking?
How about faxes? Emails?
Make it even easier for the cops.
This is a face-to-face business.
I'm gonna talk to Paulie
cos there's a few things that he needs to hear.
You figure out how much he owes for the tools
and we'll deduct that against what you'll owe
for little Paulie's hospital bills.
Yeah?
He tore up my lawn, Tone! Drove his fucking car right up on the grass.
Who did? - Fucking Paulie, who else?
40 grand in landscaping.
Terrorised my wife and daughter.
Destroyed the bushes,
the grass and every fucking flower she planted.
Just relax, OK?
I am fucking relaxed.
I'm not gonna do nothing.
Because I love you and I'm committed to my work,
I ain't gonna do shit.
I'm gonna sit tight and hold my tongue
and not cause problems for you.
Bad was '99.
Mets/Braves National League Championship.
My dad went apeshit, man.
He threw a vase through the TV.
Ho, Victor. What are you doing at a Zeek party, bro?
You settling up?
It's Friday. Bills this Sunday.
What are we, Citibank? How long we gonna carry you?
Buffalo's a lock.
Give me a dime at two and a half.
If not, my father's sending my cheque.
Fuck that.
You see this guy right here?
Tony Soprano Jr.
Know what that means, right?
Monday, bro. One way or the other.
Don't be a dick about it.
Is he still sleeping?
He's not home.
He stayed with his friends.
He sounded good. They were playing cards.
Well, it's been a week almost, on the meds.
It's a pleasure not to have him laying around here
like a miserab'.
It's companies like Wal-Mart we got to thank.
They fight against tightening imports.
So our provolone, our perfume
slides right under the fucking door.
Those inspections slow down Wal-Mart's operation.
What about terrorism, missiles and shit?
There he is, the missing link.
Hey.
How you doing?
How you doing?
Good.
I called Sal Vitro like you said.
He's coming by this week, resod the lawn.
I talked to Paulie.
We worked out a payment schedule.
He here?
Yeah.
All right.
Let me say hello.
Hey.
How you doing, kid?
How's little Paulie?
He's fucked up.
He got your flowers, though.
Good.
Listen, Paulie...
Forget it, OK?
Shit happens. What are you gonna do?
There's no point in ruminating.
You're right.
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.
Me too.
Do this again, sweetie. And get him a club soda.
You know what? Fuck it.
Whatever he's having.
Good times.
That's fucking rocket fuel.
One more.
What's going on, baby?
When, now? Who else is there?
Let's do it.
Zeek!
All right, yeah, definitely.
In 20 minutes.
Donna Amato, they're having a party.
Guess who's over there. Victor.
That welching little prick,
you fucking kidding me?
You wanna come?
I don't know. I'm just gonna hang here.
Come on! It'll be fun!
11 more credits and I can transfer to Syracuse.
Their business programme is awesome.
You made it.
Vic, where are you going, buddy?
I was just grabbing a beer. What's up?
I'm getting your money, OK?
Cool, great.
Let's take a ride and talk about it, all right?
Come on, guys, stop.
What's going on?
Nothing, we're just fucking around.
Fucking deadbeat. You know what happens when you don't pay?
Stop!
What, are you gonna cry?
What are we, fucking assholes?
Help us hold him down.
Get off me!
No!
Quit kicking, bitch!
You ever take chemistry?
Dr Parisi and me are gonna do an experiment.
See what happens when you mix sulphuric acid
with toe jam.
Fuck, no!
No! Don't, don't do it, fuck!
That hurt?
You little bitch.
I mean, you have a kid
and they look at you,
you look back.
And you're looking at yourself, really.
Or part of you plus another person,
that love.
I look at her eyes, man,
and she looks up,
back at me...
How the fuck do I put myself up for adoption?
What?
Nothing, go ahead.
She ain't adopted.
I'm kidding. What were you saying?
My point... What the fuck...
is babies. They're the future.
By the time Caitlin's out of college
it'll be the year 2027 or something.
She takes after you, she won't be out of fourth grade by then.
By that time she'll be working here, so who gives a shit?
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Come on.
We're just fucking around. It's late.
I gotta go.
Hello?
It's me.
I'm fucking losing it, man.
Chris, it's 11 fucking 30.
You're awake, though, right?
I'm sorry. You sleeping?
I'm on a deadline for a Law & Order.
Marianne's left me alone.
How much did you drink?
I don't know. A lot.
I'll make some coffee and then we'll call your sponsor.
He's gone. He's away someplace,
Philadelphia.
This fucking Paulie, man.
You think he's your friend, this cocksucker,
all these pricks...
What are you doing?
You're drunk. I'm making coffee.
I don't want fucking coffee.
It's an urban myth, anyway.
What are you writing?
Law & Order.
I'll give you stories make your fucking head curl,
the shit I seen.
Fuck that, the shit I did personally.
I don't want to hear it.
You need to sober up and get to a meeting.
That's your fucking answer?
It is the answer. Work the programme.
You know, you're a fucking robot.
Anybody ever tell you that?
You got any fucking emotion in there?
I don't know about you,
but my friends have abandoned me.
I've been totally fucking ostracized.
Because when we drink and we use,
we are not pleasant to be around.
My heart's fucking breaking and you're blowing me off?
You know, my father abandoned me.
I thought he was shot.
You have any idea, if I wanted,
what I could do to these pricks?
One phone call and it's over.
The whole fucking castle comes down...
You remember my girlfriend Adriana,
my fiance?
My friend Ralph Cifaretto?
I know shit, my friend.
Chris, come on!
Serious fucking things that would have major implications on a lot of people.
I shouldn't hear this shit.
I know. You said.
You just want to write about it, leech off me.
I'm trying to help you, man.
That fucking programme,
the government has got money to burn.
Gravano was living large down in Arizona,
all on that federal tit.
All right, let's get you home.
I like the sun.
Closer to Hollywood.
I'm calling your wife.
What? I have told you,
repeatedly, I do not want to hear this shit.
I let you be part of my movie.
You let me?
I'm pouring my heart out, man.
And I'm very sorry.
But we met in AA.
Chris,
you're in the mafia.
Fine.
Early night, huh?
Next time we're in the city,
I want to go.
What's this? Party time?
Rachael Ray was on Leno.
We got hungry.
Sit down, I'll get some plates.
Where were you guys?
Frat party.
Meeting.
Did you go out tonight?
I met a friend for coffee.
Probably why you're still awake.
I guess so.
Miss Meadow had a mystery date
she refuses to discuss.
Yeah?
What are you doing? Sit down.
I'm wired. I don't know.
What's the mystery?
That you had a date to begin with?
