winnie the bish wasn &apos;t raised to be rude .

i can &apos;t believe we &apos;re gonna live with a cop .
i mean , can we still do illegal things ?
like ...
i don &apos;t know ,
what if i want to get stoned or something ?
i &apos;ve actually never gotten stoned before .
you &apos;ve never been stoned ?
what ?
should i do it before he becomes a cop ?
we could do this .
really ?
we &apos;re adults . we can smoke a little weed .
i think we should do it .
it &apos;s been a while .
i pick up stuff really quick .
you can &apos;t just pick up pot and be good at it .
like everything else in life , it takes practice .
yeah , if pot were a piano ,
nick would be a nine @-@ year @-@ old chinese girl .
daddy &apos;s here to take care of you . i &apos;m gonna guide you through it .
i &apos;ll be your spiritual guru .
and mommy &apos;s got nothing to do this afternoon ,
so i &apos;m gonna bake some damn brownies
so we can all freak out .
let &apos;s do it .
we &apos;re getting stoned ?
this is like watching a meeting of idiot 12 @-@ year @-@ olds .
the hell is that ? what is that noise ?
your cellular technology .
i haven &apos;t gotten a non @-@ text message in two years .
jess ?
hey , uh ... so , i diced
and it was great .
but could i get a ride ?
you sure you don &apos;t want to hop on for a second ?
do you have a dog , or is this all you ?
which would you prefer ?
schmidt , will you at least just talk to me , please ?
he looked nice in his picture .
the frame cut off the bottom of his beard ,
so how was i to know it was braided into a beardy tail ?
he asked me to the food court near his house .
i thought that was down @-@ to @-@ earth , and i liked that .
he didn &apos;t bring any money ,
so we had to go back to his apartment .
and also he wanted to show me some of his old baby clothes .
maybe i &apos;m not ready for dice .
will you just help me , please ?
i want to get back out there . i have to ...
i need to get back out there .
and i know i &apos;m gullible .
&apos;cause people tell me that ,
and i have no reason not to believe them .
teach me to dice .
is that a yes ?
schmidt ?
what &apos;s happening ?
ah ! what the hell ?
i will teach you dice .
welcome and ...
good morning .
it &apos;s weird here in the morning .
it is very sad .
now , over the next 1,000 minutes ,
your notions of dating will be challenged .
jess , just listen . no notes .
i &apos;m sorry .
you put notebooks and pens on the table ,
so i thought ...
i totally get it .
look , jess , you &apos;re nervous . would you like some water ?
oh , thank you .
of course .
that &apos;s really nice of ...
never show weakness .
write that down . now , you &apos;re on dice
and this hunk shows up .
hubba hubba , mama in trubba .
don &apos;t ever do that again .
okay .
so you find this man .
he looks like a hemsworth ,
if you will .
he swipes down , you swipe down ,
you guys set a date . i show up .
hey , how you doing ? i &apos;m jack steele .
hi , jack .
wrong .
is that our taboo buzzer ?
not important . why did i buzz ?
do you think you could just return it to the box when you &apos;re done ?
the reason i buzzed is because i look nothing like this person .
look at this . there &apos;s a sun @-@ kissed sweetie .
i am a rugged semitic prince .
i thought we were role @-@ playing .
role @-@ playing ?
what about this feels like a game to you ?
ooh , i got a dice match .
jacob .
he has dreamy eyes .
them &apos;s joint @-@ bank @-@ account eyes .
okay ,
if you &apos;re saying things like &quot; dreamy eyes &quot; to my face ,
we have more work to do than the kings of leon .
good band ,
but it feels like they are stuck in one place musically .
well , i have a good feeling about this guy .
okay . i &apos;m gonna ask him out .
you &apos;re not ready yet .
i &apos;m s ... i &apos;m sorry about your phone .
i &apos;m sure you have the protection plan .
i do have the ...
never get the protection plan !
the oceans are very wild .
no man or piece of scientific technology
has ever been to the bottom of the ocean .
titanic did .
uh , titanic sunk down there ,
but that &apos;s not to the bottom .
no , the man who made titanic did .
i don &apos;t know what manhoo is , but ...
you guys seem a lot higher than me .
well , it hits everybody at different times , hoss .
but it &apos;s coming for you .
my people !
time to rally , everybody . we are going to a party .
i took cece &apos;s advice and decided to invite myself
to hang out with some of the other guys ,
and i think y &apos;all should roll with .
make me look cooler .
i &apos;ll totally go to a party on your butt .
what ?
no . no .
now , that is a humorous image .
what ?
but , seriously , you have to go .
oh , no , no , no , no .
you know what ? we &apos;re gonna go .
we &apos;re gonna go .
okay .
we &apos;re gonna go .
we &apos;re gonna go . we &apos;re gonna go .
you &apos;re gonna go ?
hey , we &apos;re gonna go .
we &apos;re gonna go .
we &apos;re gonna go .
right on , right on .
well , then we &apos;ll go .
you guys are way too messed up to be going .
you &apos;re not an expert . i am .
nobody knows we &apos;re stoned .
if we didn &apos;t go , then they would know .
you &apos;re saying that be ...
if we don &apos;t go to the party ,
they &apos;re gonna think that we &apos;re high .
oh , the guy who &apos;s never done weed .
that &apos;s not the proper term . it &apos;s &quot; smoked weed . &quot;
you don &apos;t &quot; do weed . &quot; that &apos;s a test .
you said it .
listen to me ,
first order of business , we eat their food .
okay .
then you look at the pool .
&quot; aw , what a great pool .
i wish ... i wish i could dive for rings . &quot;
because if you were stoned , you wouldn &apos;t dive for rings .
um , i was just thinking of this impression .
who am i doing ?
who am i doing ?
al pacino ?
饰演 《 教父 》 中的迈克 · 柯里昂
maybe . so , then ,
you get home , you eat some pizza ...
trust me . i just thought of every single possibility
of what could happen at that party ,
and none of them are bad .
this is a big party . i &apos;m talking wall @-@ to @-@ wall cops .
man .
oh , i did not think this through .
it just hit me .
and that is why-- no matter how tricked out it is--
you never get into a van .
... &quot; van . &quot;
moving on .
classic warning signs .
said he needed to meet you near his house .
what he was really saying was ,
&quot; i expect tonight to end in sex . &quot;
or maybe he doesn &apos;t like to be far from his pets .
never date a man with pets .
the only acceptable pet
for a man to have is a saltwater fish . okay , what now ?
okay , first test . now , i &apos;m gonna say something ,
and you tell me what &apos;s really being said .
oh , you know , i &apos;m just staying in a hotel right now .
&quot; i like to travel . &quot;
homeless . pervert .
oh , my god , my mom is just the most amazing woman .
oh . &quot; i love my mother . &quot;
virgin . and somehow also a pervert .
i kind of prefer public transportation .
oh . earth @-@ conscious .
multiple duis .
pervert .
okay , time for the next phase .
next phase ?
jess ?
hi . i &apos;m malcolm . from dice ?
oh , hi .
hi .
she &apos;ll be with you in just a minute .
okay .
you set me up on a date ?
i &apos;m wearing my lounge @-@ around underwear .
i set you up on ten dates .
what ?
ten years of experience in one day .
expert by midnight .
the dice diez .
&quot; diez &quot; is spanish for ten .
are you insane , schmidt ?
i &apos;m not ready .
that &apos;s like taking a musical from rehearsals
straight to broadway .
you got to workshop it first ...
if you are for one second suggesting
that i don &apos;t know how to open a musical ...
how dare you ? i &apos;m trying to help you out here .
now , of course you &apos;re not ready , jess .
that &apos;s why i set up ten dates .
now , you can do this . come on .
all right .
so ...
so . date talk .
okay .
what do you do ?
um , well , i don &apos;t have a job , currently , right now ,
in the traditional &quot; nine to five &quot; sense ,
but , uh , i got a lot cooking .
i &quot; grow &quot; &quot; raisins . &quot;
i &apos;m sorry , malcolm , um ,
i &apos;m gonna have to ...
get out of there .
let you finish that story .
oh , okay . i grow two types of raisins .
there &apos;s the leopold raisin ,
which is from austria .
and then there &apos;s the zwiebel raisin ,
which is also from austria .
but i think the main thing
that got me through my time in prison
was the realization
that a &quot; raisin &quot; can be anything .
we got to go !
ma called . the bees are back .
ma called . the bees are back .
oh , okay . um ...
should i just ... should i wait for you ?
you know that was a bad date , right ?
i know , but i just felt so trapped .
just do what i did , make up an excuse and then leave .
just- just say as little as you need to , okay ?
make it your own .
you ready ?
yeah .
you can do this .
okay .
you have so much hair .
what ?
where did all that hair come from ?
you &apos;re like a lioness .
so , did you know you could put
a whole live chicken in your mouth and eat it
without plucking it or preparing it at all ?
keep it simple .
uh , let &apos;s keep it simple .
you &apos;re a nice guy ,
and that &apos;s a neat outfit .
are you a chef ? are you a beatnik ?
are ... do you work on ...
on a submarine ?
no ! no !
stand down , sir !
we found your son .
he &apos;s alive .
they found my son ; he &apos;s alive .
i &apos;m sorry . it was nice meeting you .
all right , now , remember ,
y &apos;all are my dogs , okay ?
so just stay by my side
and make me look cool .
if i tell a joke , dogs got to bark .
i want to see those tails wagging out there , okay ?
oh , okay , look . look ,
there &apos;s dugan . there &apos;s dugan .
that &apos;s the guy i was telling you about . come on .
over there is better .
all right .
what ?
whatever the hell that means .
is there a cop in the house ?
i feel really calm . really relaxed .
oh , look , a hummingbird .
what the hell are you talking about ?
there &apos;s no such thing as a hummingbird .
birds don &apos;t hum .
they sing .
they basically invented singing .
you &apos;re so high right now , man .
you &apos;re so high , i couldn &apos;t possibly even bring you back .
actually , dude , i feel really good .
hey , hey , hey , hey , when you walk ,
you look like an insane person .
okay ?
and your voice sounds so stoned and crazy .
say something .
hello , nick .
that took you , like , 20 minutes .
&quot; hello , nick . &quot;
and now i &apos;m a model and a bartender .
but i ...
i &apos;m not sure what &apos;s next . i feel a little lost .
i &apos;m not exactly sure what i &apos;m doing with my life .
i &apos;m so sorry .
what was your question again ?
i didn &apos;t ask you anything .
you just walked up and started talking .
so , man , i &apos;m in the locker room ,
and i see a spider , and i &apos;m like ,
&quot; i hope this is charlotte &apos;s web
and you &apos;re nice . &quot;
you haven &apos;t seen charlotte &apos;s web ?
charlotte &apos;s web , the , uh , cartoon .
the tale about the spider who was super chill and super cool .
then , well , series of events , she ended up dying .
so that was sad .
that was sad , but spoiler alert , if you haven &apos;t seen it .
i &apos;m sure you ... you haven &apos;t seen it .
where are my dogs ?
i took the liberty of writing down some exit lines ,
because obviously , you can &apos;t come up with any on your own .
here , take a look at those .
i &apos;ve got hockey practice ?
sure .
my boss is trying to contact me
about a project that could save the company .
schmidt ,
these are such obvious rejections .
i don &apos;t want to hurt their feelings .
hurt their feel ...
do you just walk around all day
thinking about other people &apos;s feelings ?
yeah . don &apos;t you ?
no .
how do you get anything done ?
it &apos;s hard .
okay , jess ,
how can i put this ?
you &apos;re the prize here .
okay ?
you are the last piece of pie , and all of these guys
are the fat kids in the cafeteria ,
and i can say that because i used to be fat as a truck .
you really think i &apos;m the last piece of pie ?
damn right you &apos;re the last piece of pie .
you &apos;re the best girl on dice , jess .
and who cares what these guys are feeling ?
you know , what do you feel ?
jess , what do you want ?
i &apos;m the pie .
you &apos;re the pie .
i &apos;m the pie .
say it again .
i &apos;m the pie .
say it again .
i &apos;m the pie .
there you go .
who are you ?
never really thought about that .
i &apos;m not gay ,
but i would go crazy on michael strahan .
a prominent u.s. senator is trying to contact me .
you know , i just think meryl streep is a dumb bitch .
an important document has gone missing .
i need to find it .
i &apos;ve been getting into a lot of fist fights lately .
like , a lot .
more than usual .
but , you know ,
i &apos;m kind of enjoying them now .
i have an acquaintance who &apos;s in jeopardy .
jess ?
nope , not jess .
velcro shoes , pervert .
i didn &apos;t even see those .
i would love for you to share ...
share ...
what you think i should do with my life .
am i boring you now ?
officer , can i read you your rights ?
you have the right to remain hugged .
oh , no , coach !
and you have the right to remain sweet .
run ! diversion !
run ! run ! now ! now !
uh , du ... ? whoa . hold on !
what &apos;s with your friends , winston bishop ?
they kicked over the grill , and then they ran that way .
yeah ... i know .
wow . last date .
it &apos;s a big moment .
oh , my god , is that who i think it is ?
i give you dreamy eyes jacob .
happy dice birthday , jess .
you &apos;re ready for this . now , go get him .
thank you , sir .
wait a minute .
are you from portland ? the jolly cow creamery .
yeah , i used to work there summers in high school .
no way . i &apos;m from portland , too .
are you serious ?
yes . i used to go there all the time in high school .
oh , my god .
that &apos;s so funny .
yeah , i hope you like this place .
i live , like , right across the street , so ...
oh . i get it .
you asked me here because
you want me to go home with you .
wait . what ?
no . um , you know what ? i got to go .
i have hockey practice .
i &apos;m center wing , so they really need me . i ...
okay , i just live across the street .
i &apos;m not some weirdo trying to lure you back to my apartment .
i thought we were kind of hitting it off .
guess you just make a snap decision ,
and then that &apos;s it , so ...
all right , well , have a good practice .
and by the way , there &apos;s no center wing in hockey .
the dice diez !
you did it !
this thing is on !
how do you open it ?
oh , wow . this isn &apos;t even champagne .
look , it &apos;s a super fancy salad dressing .
that is delightful .
we are celebrating , me and you .
jess , you can have whatever you want on the menu .
they got pizza , gelato ,
tikka masala .
a raw bar . this place is doing too much .
they can &apos;t be doing all this right . what &apos;s wrong with you ?
i just don &apos;t understand how
what we did today is gonna help me find love .
love ?
well , why would you want to fall in love ?
why else would i go on dates ?
the point of dating is just to keep on dating ,
and then never stop .
it &apos;s like burning fossil fuels or seeing a therapist .
no . schmidt , the whole point of going on dates
is to fall in love and have a relationship .
like , don &apos;t you ever worry that you &apos;re missing out ?
i mean , you &apos;re plowing through all these girls ,
and some of &apos; em might be great , but you &apos;ll never know .
do you want to go through life that way ?
yeah .
i don &apos;t .
oh , hey , yeah . i &apos;ll take the , um ...
the rock shrimp meatballs .
what is this place ?
i think my life is going nowhere .
no , cece . it &apos;s wonderful here .
do you like to learn ?
i do .
i see you going back to school .
i see it , too .
yes , yes .
i don &apos;t see it .
yes .
she &apos;s a bartender . why would she get paid for it ?
she &apos;s not very good at it .
on the floor !
shut up !
get the dog !
get down on the ground ! yeah , and stay down !
no !
i &apos;m a student !
both of you , butts up .
i &apos;m trying .
i &apos;m trying .
see , i see you guys were high ,
so i got these guys to come and mess with you .
let &apos;s go , man .
let &apos;s never do drugs again .
that was a lot of fun ... toilet .
&quot; toilet . &quot; is that ... is that my nickname ?
yeah , &apos; cause living with these guys ,
you got to put up with a lot of crap .
lot of crap .
let &apos;s get a beer .
thank you very much .
flush , flush , what &apos;s the rush ?
toilet &apos;s coming !
you guys want to go back in ?
yeah .
yeah .
thanks for coming back .
sure .
look , i &apos;m ... i &apos;m really sorry .
um , i was ... i don &apos;t know where to begin .
uh , my roommate taught me all of these
phony excuses to get out of dates .
anyway , that is not me .
okay .
so ...
will you give me another chance to get to know you ?
yeah .
let &apos;s go back in and get a drink .
yes . great .
hey , uh , you know , we can just make that last date disappear .
like ... this coin .
you &apos;re a magician .
no . ugh . no .
i &apos;m a comedy magician .
even better .
and , like a lot of people in comedy ,
i have a little problem with , uh ... nose candy .
can &apos;t have this . it &apos;s my last one .
no ...
i &apos;m kidding . take it .
i don &apos;t want it .
please take it .
no , you take it .
okay . let &apos;s go in .
schmidt ?
i totally didn &apos;t think i &apos;d ever hear from you again .
well , you know , i just figured ,
why not see if there &apos;s something here ?
you know , let &apos;s hang out , get to know each other .
there &apos;s a coffee place down the street
maybe we could go ... grab a cup of joe .
i don &apos;t think you understand dice .
okay .
jessica !
i &apos;m late to officiate a giant &apos;s wedding ,
and these are stuck .
now the rings are free ,
but the groom is imprisoned forever .
i know how he feels .
you know what they say .
you got to crack a few eggs to , uh ...
make an amish .
it &apos;s an egg .
it &apos;s an amish person .
my uncle is on fire .
so , you &apos;ve seen a rabbit pulled out of a hat ,
but have you ever seen a hat pulled out of a rabbit ?
no , no !
oh , my ... okay , this date is over .
