this is about a plane crash .
a hammett gr @-@ 6 carrying
35 passengers and five crew .
all 40 dead .
many of their widows and widowers are here today .
and all want to know one thing .
why did this plane just drop from the sky ?
like kyle lidtke .
he lost his wife and two daughters in this crash .
now , the ceo of hammett aerospace
would have him believe it &apos;s the pilot &apos;s fault ,
and not their plane .
but we ask you to reject
this cynical , blame @-@ the @-@ victim defense ,
because this is a very simple case of ...
... a flawed airplane design .
my co @-@ counsel , ms. lockhart ,
represents the families of the passengers .
i represent the families of the crew .
but we decided to combine our lawsuits
because we agree on one thing .
hammett aerospace put a jet into service
that they knew was defective .
how do we know this ?
how do we know that they knew their jet was defective ?
because there is a very brave whistleblower
from within hammett who &apos;s agreed to testify for us .
damn .
not to sound too cynical , but this could be a good thing .
guilt @-@ ridden whistle @-@ blower
testifying from beyond the grave ?
they didn &apos;t do a great job cross @-@ examining in the depo .
and it &apos;s hard to cross @-@ examine a corpse .
the problem was in the wings .
the de @-@ icing in the wings ?
yes .
it was a system of tubes that distributed fluid
to de @-@ ice the wings during flight .
not bad .
we admit this into evidence .
and avoid further cross @-@ examination .
yup .
falling forward .
well , that &apos;s the problem .
she &apos;s a great tutor .
grace &apos;s physics grades are the best of this year .
and where did you find her ?
the tutor eli suggested her .
and grace is friends with her now ?
yes . i &apos;ll talk to her .
who , grace or the tutor ?
the tutor .
well , i can find some tutor referrals around here .
no , that &apos;s okay .
let me handle it with a flyswatter , not a bazooka .
i didn &apos;t think i was handling it with a bazooka .
uh , okay , we &apos;ll talk .
i got to go .
yes , sir .
david lee &apos;s here .
we need more conference room space .
i &apos;m like an itinerant farmer out here .
so , alicia ,
david and i head up the hiring committee ,
and we &apos;ve decided the firm needs a new first @-@ year associate .
so we want you to interview and hire someone .
really ?
these are the new graduates
from u of c. see who you like .
you want me to do the actual hiring ?
in consultation with the committee .
and you &apos;ll be mentoring him , too , so choose well .
or her .
oh , alicia , uh , i need
to talk to you a minute about the cole divorce , hmm ?
thank you for this .
no , not me . david .
i &apos;m still supposed to be tense with you , remember ?
and by the way , i know how celeste works .
don &apos;t worry about it .
no , she thrives on chaos .
she &apos;ll say a lot of things about me just to see how you react .
then i won &apos;t react .
so , we can &apos;t use &quot; cole divorce &quot; as our cover word anymore
because i actually have a cole divorce .
oh . well , we don &apos;t need a cover word .
i &apos;m still undecided about it .
ah , yes , the fiction of separation .
you &apos;re putting your kids in private school ?
new item in your financial journal .
i &apos;m thinking of it , yes .
that &apos;s $ 35,000 to 50 a year .
i know .
my advice is , you don &apos;t .
thank you , but i &apos;m fine .
no , you don &apos;t understand . i &apos;m not your accountant .
you can overspend on anything you like , but
you need to get your husband to pay half .
i ... why ?
to preserve your dependency .
you pay that amount on your own ,
you lose your best argument against spousal maintenance .
well , i &apos;m not asking peter for spousal maintenance .
no , not you . him .
hey , don &apos;t blame me . you guys wanted equal treatment .
thank gloria steinem .
peter makes less in the state &apos;s attorney office than you .
he could come after you for support .
peter &apos;s not coming after me for support .
alicia , he &apos;ll come after you for everything .
no , he wants the governorship .
that &apos;s what eli &apos;s plotting over there right now .
欧巴马总统曾在04年民主党全国大会上作主旨发言
give him the keynote .
are you kidding ?
at the democratic convention ?
peter has the best story .
he went to prison on a trumped @-@ up charge ,
fought it , and made it back into office .
it &apos;s a story of rebirth .
eli , he &apos;s a state &apos;s attorney .
and obama was a state senator when he got the keynote .
and a black man .
who is it ?
who &apos;s what ?
who are you championing ?
you must have somebody already .
adam spellman .
oh , come on !
no to the state &apos;s attorney , but yes to a dogcatcher ?
he &apos;s not a dogcatcher .
he &apos;s a strong businessman with ...
you think that &apos;s what america wants to see up on that dais ?
eli , it &apos;s already in the works . we &apos;re pushing spellman .
don &apos;t worry about it .
peter florrick &apos;s marriage is his secret weapon ,
not some keynote address .
so , how is she doing ?
they knew the de @-@ icing fluid tended to freeze
in the wing lines ,
but they decided to save money
and do nothing about it .
we move to introduce this deposition into evidence , your honor .
and we object , your honor . it &apos;s hearsay .
we can &apos;t cross @-@ examine a corpse .
really , mr. roda ?
i &apos;m sorry , your honor . inelegantly put .
but i can &apos;t cross @-@ examine the deceased .
your honor , rule 212 expressly permits the use
of a recorded deposition when a witness dies .
but only if the court , in its discretion , determines
it won &apos;t do a substantial injustice ,
such as in the case of perjury .
which is why , in the current matter , i would direct
the court &apos;s attention to mr. ritter &apos;s suicide note .
it consists of two lines .
&quot; it &apos;s a lie . i &apos;m sorry . &quot;
your honor , mr. ritter &apos;s wife was claiming
he slept with their 16 @-@ year @-@ old baby @-@ sitter .
the note refers to that .
we don &apos;t know that .
he could be referring to his testimony in this trial .
at the very least , the meaning is unclear .
unclear ? oh , really ? are you serious ?
i &apos;m not prepared to interpret the law ...
you can all wear yourselves down .
tell me when you &apos;re ready .
what do we do now ?
we have other options .
like what ?
we &apos;ll ask for a continuance .
we still have our expert witnesses .
you thought they weren &apos;t enough .
hold them accountable ,
please ... for my wife and daughters .
kalinda , what are you doing ?
um , eli business . what do you need ?
yeah , i &apos;m already on it .
yeah ?
adam spellman-- do you know who that is ?
adam spellman . a businessman .
head of the chicago black leadership council .
yeah , i need you to look into him .
look ?
as in , find dirt .
why ?
he &apos;s the likely keynote speaker at the next democratic convention ,
and if he has a skeleton in his closet ,
i do not want him blowing up in the face of the democratic committee .
really ? how selfless of you .
yeah , well , i &apos;m a caring individual .
i need it quick .
yeah . everybody needs it quick .
ah .
that was quick .
it was a blind cc .
ritter e @-@ mailed the ceo about the de @-@ icing problems ,
and on ritter &apos;s copy ,
there were only two e @-@ mail addresses included in the cc .
but on the ceo &apos;s copy , he bcc &apos;d someone else .
cs at herald equity group ? who &apos;s that ?
oh , no .
what ?
he &apos;s a client of ours from two years ago .
he was the venture capitalist on their ipo .
ceo kept him in the loop .
great .
what ?
well , he &apos;s not the most dependable of witnesses .
he might not even talk to us .
he won &apos;t .
call alicia .
why ?
he &apos;ll talk to her .
here i didn &apos;t think we &apos;d get a chance to work together .
see ? isn &apos;t this fun ?
so , you and i should get some drinks ,
trade whore stories .
horror ?
yeah . what did i say ?
he &apos;s not allowed to touch you , or hand you anything .
there &apos;s a panic button at the table if there &apos;s any problems .
that &apos;s not his style . how much does he know ?
nothing . i thought i &apos;d let you broach it .
just like clarice starling , huh ?
mrs. florrick , what a pleasure .
you seem well .
oh , under the circumstances ,
i , uh , do the best i can .
you have a tattoo , i see .
what ?
oh . oh , yeah .
oh , this ... oh , this old thing ?
i wanted william blake &apos;s the ancient of days ,
but beggars really can &apos;t be choosers here .
and you , mrs. florrick-- i imagine you &apos;re well ?
your husband &apos;s back in office ,
you &apos;re thriving in your profession .
the world must be your oyster .
i would say the grass is always greener , but ...
yes .
although , there &apos;s a refreshing honesty to prison .
people don &apos;t dissemble here , they just take .
my firm needs your help , mr. sweeney .
so , that &apos;s it for small talk ?
we &apos;re suing a company-- hammett aerospace .
there was a plane crash .
the dorset crash , yes , i know .
you were the financier on their ipo .
we had a witness who knew there was a problem
with the de @-@ icing system on the plane
but he committed suicide .
oh , dear .
yes .
anyway , he was testifying to a meeting you attended .
and you were wondering if i might testify in his stead ?
yes .
why me ?
why not o.j. ?
比眼前这位幸运多了
won &apos;t the jury be likely to mistrust
the word of a renowned wife @-@ killer ?
you were never convicted .
oh , yes .
one of those fine distinctions in the law .
imprisoned on something i didn &apos;t even do .
i hate irony .
i heard america &apos;s irony @-@ free these days .
yes , it &apos;s been outlawed .
i like you , alicia .
why don &apos;t you like me ?
you killed your wife .
and there &apos;s nothing i can do about that ?
testify .
would that help you ?
it would help 40 families suing hammett aerospace .
yes , and i &apos;m sure they &apos;re all adorable , but ...
will it help you ?
yes .
then , of course , i &apos;ll help .
oh , thank you for waiting .
work .
um ... i think you &apos;re doing a great job as a tutor .
i just ...
do you , um , want something ? you want a latte or ...
oh , no .
so , these ... videos ,
um , that you make , these dance videos , um ,
they &apos;re just ...
how old are you , jennifer ?
i &apos;m 22 .
and you and grace have become friends ?
yes .
and these , um ,
dance ... videos , uh ,
are f ...
um , what are they for ?
the internet .
you make money off of them ?
no .
you just do them ?
yes .
i don &apos;t understand .
i like doing them .
okay . um , jennifer , i ...
i just want you to be a tutor .
okay ? i @-@ i want you to work with grace on her homework .
i don &apos;t want grace making these videos with you anymore .
okay .
is that it ?
yes .
oh , my god , you &apos;re good !
thanks .
so , adam spellman ,
a democrat , really gave money
而民主党一向支持同性婚姻
to support the defense of marriage act ?
his wife did-- she &apos;s a devout baptist ,
and knew it would be a problem .
that &apos;s why the money came through her company .
and then they tried to hide it .
i mean , i think this is good that the dnc
knows this now , long before the convention .
yeah . that &apos;s very selfless of you .
okay , i need you to look into these other names
they &apos;re considering for keynote .
they may get in the way . in the way of what ?
peter florrick .
i didn &apos;t know this was for peter florrick .
oh , don &apos;t worry , i &apos;ll pay out of my own pocket .
the list .
no . but thanks , though .
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing . i have other work .
thank you for coming in , caitlin .
no , thank you-- this is so cool .
um , a very impressive resume .
you did a summer at wyler &amp; wolf in new york .
so why us ?
well , in a word , litigation . transactional &apos;s fine ,
but litigation is what really turns me on .
and the university of chicago .
what turned you on there ?
moot court .
it was an opportunity to dig deep into an area of law
but still keep my feet grounded in something real .
and did you win ?
well , my partner and i did .
it was a team effort .
i can work on my own , but i love being part of a team .
so , after your summer at wyler , did you get a job offer , or ... ?
no . they had a hiring freeze . the economy .
but i would rather be here , anyway .
just an odd question ,
it &apos;s a question they asked me when i first interviewed here .
what &apos;s your favorite hobby ?
well , i &apos;m embarrassed to say it .
oh , come on , martha , let &apos;s hear it .
what was your hobby ?
no , no , no , no--
i &apos;m the one asking the questions here .
okay . i like foreign movies , old movies ,
like truffaut and godard .
tramp @-@ boarding .
um ...
wh @-@ what &apos;s that ?
skateboarding on a trampoline ,
without wheels .
i know .
but i can do a double somersault from a full @-@ blown ollie .
to be honest ,
i &apos;ve had an offer from canning &amp; meyers .
but i really do want to work here .
i like the family spirit .
well , if you could hold off canning &amp; meyers ,
we can get back to you in a few days .
that &apos;s great . thank you , alicia .
ladies and gentlemen ,
you are hearing our testimony from a convict
housed at the pine creek penitentiary .
under agreement between the attorneys ,
the questioning will be conducted via closed @-@ circuit video .
how &apos;s my hair ?
it &apos;s fine .
y @-@ you might want to cover ...
mm ...
so are we clear on what you say ?
i am to answer honestly and completely .
yes , but not too completely .
just keep your answers short and on point .
how long ?
about five minutes .
something ...
about you two .
some kind of tension there .
what is it ?
are you gonna tell him ?
i would like to just concentrate on his testimony .
oh , come on , you can &apos;t leave it like that .
there won &apos;t be any testimony unless you tell me what it is .
we &apos;re lovers .
we &apos;ve been keeping it secret for months . alicia ?
i really don &apos;t want to talk about it right now .
she &apos;s breaking up with me for a man who is not worthy of her .
if only it were true .
ready to go .
three , two , go .
short and to the point .
hello , mr. sweeney . can you hear me ?
yes , ma &apos;am . good morning .
good morning to you . i understand you &apos;ve been sworn in .
may i ask you a few questions ?
yes . i &apos;ve been wonderfully prepped here
by two of your beautiful attorneys .
mr. sweeney , can you tell us
how you became acquainted with hammett aerospace ?
yes . i ...
uh , rather , my company--
my company--
was , uh ... retained to provide financing
for their initial public stock offering .
how &apos;s that ?
and in that capacity ,
did you attend a meeting at which hammett executives
discussed potential problems with the gr @-@ 6 ?
uh , yes , um , i @-@ i believe i did .
and at this meeting , can you tell us
what was discussed regarding the de @-@ icing system on the airplane ?
the ... i &apos;m sorry , i @-@ i ...
uh , could you repeat the ...
at this meeting ...
we need to cut him off ; he &apos;s gonna hurt us .
... the de @-@ icing system on the airplane ?
mr. sweeney , do you need a moment ?
i don &apos;t ... i don &apos;t know .
your honor , i have to ask for a brief continuance .
uh , clearly , my witness is having health issues .
your witness is having second thoughts .
mr. sweeney , what are you doing ?
what am i doing ?
i &apos;m undercutting your case .
why ?
because i want something .
what ?
freedom .
he &apos;ll testify if we free him ?
with good behavior , he &apos;s got two years left on his sentence .
he says that he has something to offer the state &apos;s attorney .
evidence on drugs in prison .
i think i can find a way to get around
the private school money situation .
hold on , margie . hold on .
well , thank you .
no problem .
so , uh , how are the interviews going ?
great . i reinterviewed my top two choices ,
and i think i &apos;ve made a decision .
great . isn &apos;t caitlin fantastic ?
caitlin ?
yes . did she tell you how much
she loves competition ?
she did . do you know her ?
yes . she &apos;s my niece .
i told her not to mention it because i didn &apos;t
want her to win out based on nepotism .
i &apos;m glad you liked her .
well , i did , um , but i ...
what ? !
no ! oh , come on !
next time i &apos;ll get some long benches in here .
colin sweeney wants to make a deal .
yes . i read your e @-@ mail .
oh , yes . imani . hello .
come on in , come on in .
this is imani stonehouse-- she &apos;s an ausa
assigned to our office to review racial bias in sentencing ,
and she keeps me honest with all my plea bargains .
okay . so ...
our good friends from lockhart / gardner ...
and monty &amp; columbech .
yes .
they have an offer to make us in trade
for releasing the wife @-@ killer , colin sweeney .
the defensive killer of his stalker , colin sweeney .
and i &apos;m sure imani &apos;ll have something to say about that .
cary , you &apos;ve seen an increase in heroin distribution
at the cook county prison complex .
mr. sweeney can tell you who
and how , including guards .
in trade for his freedom .
yes .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s going to fly , but thank you .
why don &apos;t you check with your boss .
peter florrick promised to fight corruption in the prison system .
this could go a long way towards that .
okay .
i &apos;ll be right back .
so where did you go to school ?
brown . you ?
harvard . siblings ?
three brothers .
lawyers ?
no , the family was happy to have just one lawyer .
one &apos;s a painter , one &apos;s a writer ,
one teaches at the sorbonne .
really ?
that &apos;s in france , isn &apos;t it ?
hmm .
okay , i talked to peter , and he has a counteroffer .
okay . what counteroffer ?
donny pike .
senior acting member of the aryan warlords .
he &apos;s finishing up a five year stretch at pine creek penitentiary .
oh , come on .
the most dangerous man in the illinois system ?
yes , he is .
and a confidante of colin sweeney .
mr. sweeney gives him stock tips and pike gives him protection .
you want sweeney to testify against him ?
yes . if he wants a reduction in his sentence .
the last witness you tried to turn against him was murdered .
yes . well , we &apos;ve learned from our mistakes .
here , you can keep this .
i was the asa who won that plea bargain
and you &apos;re really considering reversing it ?
not reversing it . he &apos;s served two years .
for killing a woman .
no , involuntary manslaughter , with good behavior .
this is colin sweeney we &apos;re talking about .
the public knows his name .
if we release him , we &apos;ll be crucified .
not if we &apos;re using him to stop
a neo @-@ nazi from committing more murders from prison .
what do you think , imani ?
i think it &apos;s worth it
if we can stop this white supremacist .
yeah . if you stop him .
but if colin sweeney takes the stand ,
i don &apos;t know a jury in the world who would trust him .
okay , we &apos;re going to make the deal .
peter , this is a mistake .
you &apos;ll be the man who released o.j.
would you make the deal if it was just anybody ?
but it &apos;s not just anybody .
i know , but if it were ...
would you make the deal ?
two years left on an involuntary manslaughter ?
there &apos;s your answer .
but geneva makes a good point about the testimony .
we &apos;re going to make the deal ,
but he &apos;s got to give us more .
what more ?
a wire .
eli .
what have you got ?
keynote address at the democratic convention .
they were going with spellman ,
but he has an issue opposing gay marriage ,
so i got you the hearing with donna brazile .
i &apos;m stunned .
that &apos;s why you hired me , peter .
to stun you .
look , you don &apos;t have to decide about running for governor .
just take the meeting , sweep her off her feet ,
keep hitting the prison thing .
that &apos;s your selling point .
what ?
i may be in the news this week .
okay .
a plea bargain that could gain a lot of attention .
can you delay it ?
i could .
but i won &apos;t .
so this ethical thing is for real , right ?
i would love to give that keynote speech .
then don &apos;t get in the news .
and what does kalinda sharma have against you ?
the investigator at lockhart / gardner ,
she won &apos;t do any work for you .
what &apos;s that about ?
i don &apos;t know .
really ? i didn &apos;t know that . is she good ?
caitlin ?
yes . it &apos;s just ...
she &apos;s david lee &apos;s niece , and i &apos;m feeling a little pressure .
who &apos;s the better lawyer ?
well , they &apos;re both good .
it &apos;s just ...
i don &apos;t know , there &apos;s something about martha .
i like her .
and caitlin is a classic &quot; c &quot; student .
well , you know what they say :
&quot; a &quot; students make great professors ,
&quot; b &quot; students make great judges ,
and &quot; c &quot; students make partner .
mom !
okay , i got to go . thanks , will .
did you tell jennifer not to be friends with me ?
did i ... ?
did you tell her not to be my friend ?
no , i told her that i wanted her
to concentrate more on your studies .
why ? what did she say ?
nothing .
she left after we studied .
why would you tell her that ?
because , grace ...
she &apos;s 22 , and you &apos;re 14 .
so ?
so ...
why isn &apos;t she with friends her own age ?
because she &apos;s my friend .
no , she &apos;s you &apos;re tutor .
i &apos;m paying her .
why can &apos;t she be both ?
because it &apos;s unprofessional .
it &apos;s ...
i don &apos;t have friends , mom .
don &apos;t you know that ?
she &apos;s my only real friend .
she &apos;s my friend .
and with you at work all the time ...
no , no , no , no , no , no .
you do not get to play that card .
look , maybe i overreacted .
i just don &apos;t want you doing these videos .
i just think it &apos;s dangerous to do them in the street .
it &apos;s not .
grace , would you please
just let me be the parent for a minute here .
if you want to take dance ...
i don &apos;t want to take dance .
i just want to do this .
why ?
because it &apos;s cool .
because nobody else is doing it .
okay , let me think on it .
alicia florrick .
ah , my goodness .
the quality of convicts has really gone downhill .
we have a deal for you , mr. sweeney .
that &apos;s why we &apos;re meeting you here .
they will give you your freedom
in exchange for evidence against donny pike .
donald ?
yes ,
he &apos;s ordered the deaths of four witnesses from prison .
you want me to testify against him ?
no . the deal &apos;s not for what you know .
it &apos;s for what you &apos;ll find out .
we don &apos;t think you &apos;re the most trustworthy witness .
that &apos;s why we &apos;ll need you to wear a wire .
that wasn &apos;t the deal .
well , that &apos;s the new deal .
we &apos;re arranging to have pike transferred to another prison ,
they &apos;ll route him through county .
mr. sweeney and pike will have three hours together in the yard .
get him to admit to his newest murder , and you &apos;re free .
no . it &apos;s too dangerous .
is it , mr. sweeney ?
is it too dangerous ?
you don &apos;t want to do this .
alicia , it &apos;s his decision .
you &apos;re gonna have to supervise the wire .
he thinks you care about him .
what &apos;s even weirder-- you do care about him .
no . i don &apos;t want him getting killed .
that &apos;s a pretty low bar for caring .
it &apos;s a pretty high bar for a wife @-@ killer .
you &apos;re very interesting , alicia .
how did you end up with will ?
what makes you think we ended up together ?
will &apos;s attitude .
he &apos;s smitten .
really ? smitten .
feels like the right word .
it &apos;s sweet and high school , and very vanilla .
that &apos;s no slam on you .
no , of course not .
but what about you ?
you broke up with will nine years ago .
and yet , here you are , trying to hurt him .
talk about high school .
what do you think you &apos;re doing ? !
david .
she &apos;s my niece . i told you she &apos;s my niece .
oh , wait a minute . you @-@ you told me to hire who i wanted .
yes , and i told you she was my niece .
what else do you need to know ?
look , david , caitlin &apos;s good .
she &apos;s very good , and she &apos;ll find another job .
this isn &apos;t about another .
don &apos;t you dare cross me again .
you said you didn &apos;t want nepotism .
no , i said there was no nepotism .
you are a third @-@ year associate .
you were given this task because you are unimportant ,
and you can take a hint .
so take the hint ,
or we &apos;ll take it out of your hands .
let &apos;s get a drink .
you know the best revenge ?
hide his bluetooth .
no . hire his niece , and then make her life hell .
oh , my god , you are so right .
you &apos;ll never do it .
no , i will do it .
i &apos;m not a good person .
yes , you are . shut up .
i just don &apos;t like women .
i find them uninteresting .
excuse me ?
i don &apos;t like women .
they &apos;re all competing with me .
don &apos;t men compete with you ?
no , they don &apos;t .
you have female friends ?
no ,
but i don &apos;t have any male friends , either .
that &apos;s so sad .
i &apos;d be your friend , but i can &apos;t .
why not ?
because . will .
ah , that &apos;s right .
yeah .
i don &apos;t like you being with him .
i &apos;m gonna break you two up .
okay . how ?
how will i do it ?
i will ... tell you about him .
well , go ahead .
give me your worst .
no . i like you .
see , that &apos;s your problem .
you built it up too much ,
so if he hasn &apos;t buried a hobo in the desert ,
i will be unimpressed .
oh , that &apos;s ancient history anyway .
and it was only $ 45,000 .
that &apos;s all ?
yup , and he put it back .
you &apos;re so bad at this .
yeah , i know . i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m transparent as cellophane .
i got to go .
you &apos;re kidding .
nope .
just remember , will is like me .
he &apos;ll always disappoint you .
attention , attention ...
the microphone is sewn into your collar , mr. sweeney .
just keep your hands away from it .
mm @-@ hmm , very clever .
testing , testing !
just a normal voice , mr. sweeney .
okay , so just to remind you ,
pike you know ,
but this fine citizen here is darryl boyd ,
pike &apos;s lieutenant on the outside .
pike orders a hit in here , boyd carries it out on the street .
this is garfield park just last week .
you get pike to admit he ordered the garfield park hit ,
and i sign your release authorization .
simple as that , huh ?
i &apos;ll be right here , mr. sweeney , watching .
anything goes wrong ,
just walk away .
they have security guards standing by .
they won &apos;t get there in time .
when things happen , mrs. florrick , they happen fast .
well , don &apos;t get yourself killed , okay ?
words to live by .
okay ,
here we go .
break a leg .
hey , it &apos;s sweeney .
what &apos;s up , paperboy ?
it &apos;s all right , he &apos;s cool .
donald , hey .
what are you doing here ?
testifying .
some civil case .
just an excuse for a vacation , actually .
i talked it up so they &apos;d go for it .
so what &apos;s going on with the market ?
did you see hp ?
yeah , don &apos;t worry .
sell at 20 and you &apos;ll be fine .
listen , donald , i wanted to ask you about something .
um , i read about garfield park in the paper .
was that you ?
what is he doing ?
why you talking about stuff
that don &apos;t concern you , sweeney ?
no , no , no , i was just wondering .
well , don &apos;t .
you know , you &apos;re funny .
like a pet .
don &apos;t make me put you down .
i like him .
i like him , too .
he has a good story .
he does-- prison , wrongful conviction ,
back from the dead .
he &apos;d make a good keynote .
he speaks well .
he does .
so ?
i just don &apos;t want him to blow up in our face .
how would he blow up in your face ?
his marriage .
are you hearing something ?
of course i am .
i &apos;m hearing they live apart ,
and if i &apos;m hearing it , the republicans are hearing it , too .
if they were hearing it , they &apos;d use it .
no , they would do what we would do--
release it the day before he speaks .
of course you don &apos;t have an issue with it , eli .
peter florrick is in office .
when he runs for governor , they will use it .
they will use all of it , not just on him but his wife , too .
what if i promised they &apos;d be together ?
is that a promise you can keep ?
yes , it is .
then we &apos;ll consider him for keynote .
again , eli , i like him .
he &apos;s a thoroughbred ,
but i just can &apos;t risk ... risk .
okay , here he goes .
we &apos;ve got about ten minutes before they return
to their cells .
i thought we were done talking .
i @-@ i @-@ i want to know about garfield park .
is he out of his mind ?
look at this guy .
what are you , stupid ?
what , are you smoking crack with the brothers ?
get the guard ready .
i think he looks like a snitch .
think he looks like a snitch ?
go now , cary .
he &apos;s a snitch .
you got to pull him out now .
we pull him out now , no deal .
wait , listen .
hey , hey , donald , i @-@ i didn &apos;t mean anything by it .
why the hell do you keep asking ?
&apos;cause i @-@ i need your help .
you know what they did .
they took my company from me .
everybody here &apos;s got a story , paperboy .
what makes you so special ?
i have money ...
and i want the man who did this dead .
gerald drescher .
he used to be my vice president
until he stabbed me in the back .
you &apos;re serious ?
how much would it cost ?
a guy like that has security .
oh , nothing worse than the security in garfield park .
uh ,
job like that-- it &apos;ll cost a lot of money .
that &apos;s why i got to know what i &apos;m getting .
okay , here he goes , nice move .
you &apos;re pushing it , sweeney .
you &apos;re in prison .
i &apos;m asking , how can you get it done ?
all right , sure .
garfield park-- yeah , that was me .
my boy on the outside-- i get word to through my sister .
i give the green light , he does the hit .
a hit on his vice president , huh ?
oh , come on , he had to say something .
you have the release authorization ?
already blessed by judge romano .
pleasure doing business with you .
is your health issue from the other day better , mr. sweeney ?
much better , thank you .
my goodness , i must have made a fuss here .
food poisoning .
uh , now , mr. sweeney , you testified
that you were present at the ipo meeting ?
that &apos;s right .
and did you hear any discussion
about the deicing in the wings ?
oh , yes ,
i heard everything ,
and it &apos;s not good .
good job , i , i hear you saved some kind of case today .
oh , i just-- we got a settlement .
great , great .
we should talk sometime .
about ?
the future .
what else ?
i &apos;m so sorry i &apos;m late .
thank you for coming back in , martha .
i just had a few more questions before we decide .
before you ... ?
what are you talking about ?
they already decided .
i @-@ i &apos;m sorry , what ?
i didn &apos;t get the job here .
i turned down my other job
because i thought i had this , and now ...
i can &apos;t believe this .
well , who told you you didn &apos;t get this ?
the hiring committee . they called .
well , there must be some sort of mistake ,
because i haven &apos;t decided yet .
no , they did .
he said i was close , but they had a vote .
so what happened ?
now , your office is on the 27th floor ,
but i want to show you around here first .
now , this ...
alicia !
thank you so much .
i am just so thrilled .
david said it was all you .
you picked me , and you &apos;re gonna be my mentor .
yes , alicia , thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
anyway , i am really looking forward to working with you .
thank you again .
i don &apos;t get it .
why put me through the charade ...
alicia ..
no . i want to know .
i never had any power , did i ?
it was all rigged .
david lee appealed to the hiring committee ,
and the hiring committee voted to go another way .
that &apos;s all . it happens .
which way did you vote ?
on what ?
the committee voted for caitlin and against martha .
which way did you vote ?
i voted with david lee .
why ?
because i owed him .
for what ?
you don &apos;t want to know .
i do want to know .
i feel used , will .
i feel like i was given a job and it was taken away from me .
there was a martha
when we hired you , alicia .
on paper , she was the better candidate
and you were the ... caitlin .
you were gonna lose in a vote .
i asked david lee to vote with me .
so i owed him .
you okay ?
thank you .
