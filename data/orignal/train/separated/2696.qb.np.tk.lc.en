i heard you copped to everything .
they had my dna .
moron . it takes six weeks to get dna tests .
shit .
i gotta go .
i didn &apos; t tell you yet .
what ?
jackie .
he was doing a deal with some black dudes . they shot him .
he &apos;s , like , dead .
22 years old , living in a housing project .
imagine the shame for the family .
fortunately , they were no longer boyfriend and girlfriend .
how &apos;s your daughter taking it ?
not well .
you certainly saw it coming with this boy , didn &apos;t you ?
in the end , i failed him .
what the fuck you gonna do ? world today ...
one thing . i won &apos;t make the same mistake with a.j.
he got expelled . him we &apos;re sending to military school .
we never discussed exactly what you want for your children .
i don &apos;t want their faces blown off .
you went into your father &apos;s business .
i didn &apos;t have a choice .
i try to give my kids every opportunity .
meadow &apos;s going to columbia , for chrissakes .
wants to be some kind of a professional woman .
like you .
a psychiatrist ?
and have to listen to guys like me whine all day ?
she mentioned being a pediatrician once .
you &apos;d like that ?
i would like something like that .
but the important thing is she get far away from me .
i mean , she could live close .
i think i understand .
and your son ?
a.j. ?
in my business ? forget it .
he &apos;d never make it .
your father and i have to drive a.j. up to hudson institute .
i &apos;d feel much better if you were up .
jackie &apos;s dead , and you perseverate on secondary schools ?
i was up half the night with ro .
this morning her sister and i made all the funeral arrangements .
a.j. doesn &apos;t have a school .
he can &apos;t chat all day on the web with the other dropouts and flakes .
you know , he &apos;s the first person my own age that i knew that ever died .
well , he knew all the risks involved .
what , the x ?
half the kids i know take it . they get it from someone .
it &apos;s not a thing you get killed over .
except he did .
or not .
meaning ?
look at who he grew up with .
look at who his father was . look at everyone we know .
let &apos;s not get cute .
when i &apos;m being cute , i &apos;ll tell you .
you liked jackie , so you won &apos;t believe it was his fault .
so , like others , you look for bogeymen with italian names to blame .
so whatever you &apos;re thinking , stop , because that is not what happened .
stealing an exam is a personal defeat .
it was wrong .
that sounds pre @-@ programmed .
is that how you saw your future self ? a cheat ?
no .
how do you explain it ?
there &apos;s , like , academic pressure . about getting into college .
they &apos;re obsessed .
with &quot; like , academic pressure &quot; ? or academic pressure ?
there &apos;s all this pressure . my parents too .
my sister goes to columbia and my parents expect me to go .
that &apos;s &quot; stinking thinking . &quot; like with an alcoholic .
no one makes him drink .
i &apos;m not an alcoholic .
how do we do things differently than at your former school ?
i don &apos;t know .
i realize that .
i &apos;m about to tell you .
at your school , and it &apos;s not a bad one , you &apos;re right ...
... there &apos;s too much emphasis on what &apos;s good for you , john and jane .
here , the higher good is of the corps . as gen. macarthur said :
&quot; the corps , the corps , the corps . &quot;
now , how do we achieve this revolution in thinking on your part ?
cadet corps has first call 0530 each day ...
... march to first mess 0620 ...
... dorm inspection 0700 , classes 0800 to 1440 .
athletic formation 1500 , except thursdays , which is drill .
1900 to 2100 is evening study time . taps , lights out 2200 .
what &apos;s missing ? give up ? television .
what &apos;s &quot; 0530 &quot; mean ?
5 : 30 a.m.
i outlined a blueprint for self @-@ discipline ...
... that would take you through your life , and that &apos;s your question ?
why do guys in the army , or spies , use that &quot; 0 &quot; thing when they tell time ?
that &apos;ll be made abundantly clear .
for now , we have an expression : keep it simple .
captain delaunay ?
give mr. soprano the t.o.i. while i meet his parents .
sir , yes , sir .
i think anthony could greatly benefit from our program ...
... which , as i candidly told him , is very rigorous .
do you mind ?
i &apos;ll be very frank with you . i do not agree with this hard @-@ nosed discipline .
the mothers seldom do .
wait till he starts opening doors for you .
now , that would be a miracle .
what about creativity ? independent thought ?
i stressed heavily notions of duty and groupthink .
but i didn &apos;t mention the army &apos;s motto of today : be an army of one .
why be an army at all ? how about a veterinarian ?
isn &apos;t there enough war ?
amputees ? horrible displaced ...
he &apos;s just gonna march a little bit .
don &apos;t get hung up on marching . it &apos;s part of it ...
... but it &apos;s nothing compared to the mentoring and faculty involvement .
well , that sounds wonderful .
we &apos;ve created too many options for our kids . they &apos;re confused .
when things go wrong , we fob them off onto the substance @-@ recovery industry .
this &quot; army of one &quot; thing . what happens when each army of one decides :
&quot; fuck it , i won &apos;t go over the foxhole &quot; ?
or , &quot; let &apos;s shoot the lieutenant &quot; ? because they been told ...
... you know , &quot; you &apos;re an army of one . &quot;
audie murphy was an army of one .
we &apos;re preparing him for a military career ?
no . no .
one day at a time .
you want to train him to be a killer ?
will you stop ? they &apos;re soldiers .
the army hardly ever goes to war !
they were marching with rifles !
they &apos;re symbolic !
symbolic of what ?
respect !
he will be disciplined by kids hardly older than himself .
boys his age still kill frogs and small animals .
the cusamanos &apos; binky ? the bomb with nails , you think it was a.j. ?
no . that &apos;s what i am trying to say !
he is still a child ! he &apos;s a normal child !
he &apos;s made mistakes and he &apos;s got a shitload to learn .
that doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;ll let you send him to a school ...
... that scares him into following orders !
he thinks the world owes him a living !
what could have given him that idea ?
we tried it your way for 15 years . validating his feelings .
that school did the same ! he thinks the world runs on his feelings !
he &apos;s gonna go learn to be a man !
i will not send him to that place !
oh , no , fuck that ! allow me !
fuck !
god !
about the sit @-@ down ...
jesus christ , can i bury my best friend &apos;s kid ?
i am not ready for this .
okay , let &apos;s go . we gotta do this .
come here , you .
rosalie ?

it &apos;s okay .
a point and a quarter .
would you listen to me , moose ? it &apos;s very simple .
look at this place .
two days before the super bowl and nobody shows up .
that &apos;s not true .
you &apos;d think i &apos;d remember , all my years married to jack .
what happened , ton ? vegas moving the line ?
just make sure .
point and a half .
talk to you a minute ?
russ ? mr. cozzarelli ? my partner and i cut this .
devotional music . it &apos;s ragged , it &apos;s a demo . christian contemporary .

... iooks like he &apos;s gonna offer us a deal .
listen , about jackie . and , you know , ralph .
how you handled it , so it
wouldn &apos;t stick to any of us ...
i &apos;m only here out of respect to you . but i &apos;m sorry .
and i appreciate you looking out for me .
oh , yeah ?
you two were close , i know ...
no , you don &apos;t know .
anyway , what i said , about not loving you ...
that &apos;s not how it is .
let &apos;s try it your way .

sit down . relax , have a coffee . he &apos;ll be here .
well , i think i got ma situated .
the brother jobe home ?
no , fuck that . we went there .
che puzzo , i almost gagged .

on tony &apos;s recommendation .
i never did that .
you did . when you had your ma there .
by the way , did she have the silver bird package ?
i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s the most expensive nursing home .
it &apos;s a retirement community .
the level of care . ma was crying .
eight grand a month ?
who cares ?
you see a seeing eye dog here ? cup full of pencils ?
i &apos;m not trying to insult you ...
be tough , but i &apos;ll figure it out .
worth every fucking penny . i &apos;m the hero now , boy .
thank you .
you &apos;re late .
i can be on time ...
... but you &apos;ll always be stupid .
hey , hey ! sit down !
sit the fuck down and shut up !
you want one of those ?
no .
i was at my goomar &apos;s all night .
ro , with the grief , poor kid . i can &apos;t get any sleep . it &apos;s incessant .
so . who wants to talk first ?
what &apos;s to talk about ? i &apos;m owed that 50 g &apos;s .
a fucking alarm code ? 50 g &apos;s ? five , tops . maybe , as a finder &apos;s fee .
the heist fell in your lap .
you fuck those fat pigs at the carpenter &apos;s union .
three mil a year from construction , this family sees .
all right , five &apos;s a negotiating platform .
take it easy .
it &apos;s not five , we all know that . his guys did the heavy lifting .
little paulie was good to go . fucking car never came .
they left him waiting outside his house like an asshole .
ralphie , give him 12 k.
i can &apos;t believe this .
why not ?
you believed a ufo was over jersey .
i won &apos;t tell you again !
t , i &apos;m asking you to reconsider .
you requested a sit @-@ down . he heard you out .
but christ , i &apos;m leaving $ 38,000 on the table .

it was his boss &apos; mother &apos;s wake . i said , &quot; you think tony even noticed ? &quot;
but he keeps on about everything .
oh , madonna . jesus ...

pediatrician said .
he &apos;s got that putrid fucking soprano gene !
it &apos;s a slight tic in his fight / flight response .
it doesn &apos;t brand him as anything .
you know , it comes down through the ages .
my great @-@ great @-@ great @-@ grandfather drove a mule cart off a road .
he was taking valuable jugs of olive oil .
probably was a panic attack .
when you blame your genes , you &apos;re blaming yourself .
and that &apos;s what we should be talking about .
fucking verbum dei school .
it happened before , but they didn &apos;t tell us .
idiot nurse diagnosed it as dehydration from football practice .
can you believe they didn &apos;t inform the parents ?
i &apos;m not a litigious person .
i prefer to resolve things directly , but this time i &apos;ll sue !

&quot; ashes to ashes , dust to dust .

mackenzie .

i was just asking .
oh , please . okay ?
my brother &apos;s stupid , pathetic dream was to follow our father &apos;s footsteps .
i gotta paint a picture ? he was killed by a fat fuck in see @-@ through socks .
take your pick , they all look alike .
actually , kelli , you really have no basis to say that .
we used to joke around about our families . what happened to you ?
i know this is a really painful time for you , but ...
... your brother &apos;s best friend was an israeli x dealer .
i met him .
wow ! so it was international .
let &apos;s just drop it , okay ?
yeah , right .
if my dad still controlled crime in north jersey like your dad does ...
... i &apos;d want to drop it too . but then ...
... it might not have happened .
wait , this is way beyond .
our dads are in the garbage business .
and they do brush up against organized crime .
but you think they control every slimeball and illegal gun ?
the fact that you would say this in front of an outsider is amazing to me .
jesus christ , some loyalty ?
their names etched in history .
their hands around football &apos;s most revered trophy . immortalized ...

i gotta go . ma &apos;s alone .

the penguin exhibit .
jack tried to lay jackie &apos;s problems on a learning disorder , but ...
stupidity would be a learning disorder .
