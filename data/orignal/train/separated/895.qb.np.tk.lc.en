back in the &apos; 80s , this is what cool looked like .
the makeup was as heavy as the perfume ,
the hair crimped and curled ,
and , most importantly , the shoulders bared .
even though my sister owned the look ,
it was a bumpy ride to get her there .
back in ninth grade ,
my sister was a giant ball of awkwardness .
hi , dan .
cool clarinet .
so , i know i &apos;ve asked a few times ,
but did you ever figure out
your plans for the winter formal ?
listen , erica , i only like you as a lab partner .
and to be honest , e @-@ even then ,
i fantasize about other lab partners , so ...
but then a miracle happened .
erica goldberg got contact lenses ,
stopped shampooing with bar soap ,
lost her braces ,
and learned how to tame her rat &apos;s nest .
and just like that ,
my sister blossomed from awkward to awesome .
hey . hi , erica .
hey , don .
it &apos;s , uh -- it &apos;s dan .
but you could call me don if you like that name better .
in fact , erica was so awesome that in one week ,
she would get to be on the coolest tv show
proudly filmed in our hometown .
it was &quot; dance party usa &quot; --
30 minutes of fierce &apos; 80s grooving
featuring the hottest girls and baddest boys
in the skimpiest of belly shirts .
holy god , look at those dance moves !
i &apos;d do anything to tease my bangs that high .
just think -- in one week everyone in school
will see us dancing under those neon lights .
we &apos;ll be regionally famous .
so , what moves you gonna bust out first ?
i &apos;m thinking i &apos;d walk like an egyptian
right into the safety dance .
speaking of dancing , barry has arrived !
god , barry .
the only thing worse than your moves is your gross eye .
it &apos;s just pink eye . everyone gets it .
everyone doesn &apos;t get it
from a kaleidoscope they found under a bridge .
a goopy eye is well worth
the colorful view of the world this baby &apos;s given me .
honey , you &apos;re gonna give it to your other eye .
unlike erica ,
barry was still struggling to find his awesomeness ,
and growing that rat tail last summer didn &apos;t really help .
this will always be awesome .
i &apos;m so stoked to be on tv !
i want to make sure i lock down a solo platform .
that sounds like a perfect plan .
but there &apos;s only one teeny , tiny problem --
you &apos;re not coming .
lainey , you &apos;re my girl , girl .
talk some sense into her .
you don &apos;t want him to go ?
no .
sorry .
did everything i could .
come on , baby .
look in my good eye and give me one reason why ?
barry , this is going on tv .
they don &apos;t want spazzy dancing freaks
who lose their mind when the lunch lady runs out of pudding .
that only happened three times !
they should know by now to fully stock the pudding !
sweetie , you &apos;re doing it again .
fine . i &apos;ll just ... dance it off , okay ?
watch me go .
how can you deny the world this sweet rhythmic magic , huh ?
oh , is this happening ?
what ?
get away ! i &apos;m contagious !
the only thing that &apos;s contagious
are your sweet dance moves .
it was april 29 , 1980 @-@ something ,
and i was about to spend the day
with the most magical badass i knew -- pops .
here you go , boys .
toad in the hole for my snuggle face ,
raisin bran and prune juice
for the coolest and most regular daddy i know .
that &apos;s a pass on breakfast , bev .
me and the kid are headed out for a big day on the town .
first , tennis at the club .
and if there &apos;s time , we hit the art museum .
honestly , there should be a museum for the two of you .
it will be called the shmoopie center for cuteness
and i will be the curator
and people will line up for blocks
just to delight in your deliciousness .
she just had her morning coffee . you go .
i &apos;ll stay and be a body in the room for her .
and go we did , but not to tennis or a museum , no .
we headed to the south jersey gem known as atlantic city .
back then , it was a sketchy , degenerate wonderland
where they actually let in a baby @-@ faced boy like me --
no questions asked .
pops &apos; game of choice was craps .
and although no human could understand it ,
all i knew was that as long as my grandfather
had his lucky watch , the man was unstoppable .
seven out . seven out .
is that bad ?
oh , not for us .
i dropped a c @-@ note on the come at the last second ,
so now we &apos;re up $ 50 .
my god , even when you lose you win .
here you go , al . seafood buffet on us .
free all @-@ you @-@ can @-@ eat popcorn shrimp ?
seriously , how does this casino stay in business ?
as i was living it up with my hero ,
barry was beyond desperate
to no longer be the crusty eyed zero .
yo ! big &quot; e &quot; !
siblings , am i right ?
you can &apos;t come with us .
just hear me out .
&quot; dance party usa &quot; is the one chance i get
to show everyone at school
that i &apos;m not just a pink @-@ eyed loser
dating some girl out of his league .
they &apos;ll have to respect the guy
who danced briefly on local television .
i &apos;m begging you with all my heart .
please do this for me .
i &apos;m glad you came to me with this ,
and i really appreciate your honesty .
and now i hope you can appreciate mine .
i think you &apos;re unappealing and gross .
barry knew no amount of begging could change erica &apos;s mind .
what he didn &apos;t know was
that pink eye is highly contagious .
what &apos;s happening on your face ?
i caught barry &apos;s gross pink eye .
i can &apos;t wear my contacts .
at all ? we &apos;re supposed to be on tv in three days .
move it , lainey . get to class .
take mrs. magoo with you .
don &apos;t worry , lainey . i &apos;ll look fine for tv .
these are just reading glasses . i don &apos;t need them to see .
how did you not see that ? !
&apos;cause i lied ! i want to dance on tv !
walk it off , goldberg .
as erica was headed for an emergency dental procedure ,
pops and i were headed home winners .
that &apos;s another one for the record books .
here &apos;s your taste of the action , kiddo .
always a pleasure .
me too , pops .
i &apos;m just hoping one of these days ,
some of your awesomeness will rub off on me .
what are you talking about ? you &apos;re plenty awesome .
not like you .
your life is a parade of money , free shrimp ,
and old ladies that you find hot and i find sad .
you &apos;re the luckiest guy i know . it &apos;s like magic .
trust me , you have it in you , too .
really ? &apos; cause my life hasn &apos;t been magical at all .
even at magic camp , i was a total third @-@ stringer .
all the magic you need is right in here .
if you just believe in yourself like i do , you can &apos;t lose .
after pops made me realize i was a winner ,
i tested my gambling skills at the riskiest game in town --
finger football .
what do you say we make this interesting ?
fine . the big boys play for lunch snacks .
what did your hot mom pack for dessert today ?
she is hot , dude .
dave kim likes an hourglass shape .
harkens back to old hollywood .
shut up , dave kim .
and lunch snacks are adorable ,
but i say we play for your &quot; hulk &quot; issue 181 .
what are you offering ?
let me just whip out my money clip here .
how &apos;s about every series 1 garbage pail kid i got .
big mistake , goldberg .
the mistake is yours , bro .
this was it .
thanks to pops , i knew i had the magic touch ...
and nothing could stop my luck .
nice doing business with you .
wait . you can &apos;t just walk away now .
double or nothing .
i &apos;m listening .
i bet my megatron .
i bet all my robots .
my entire nintendo system .
all my games .
is my soul worth anything ?
it &apos;s gone . it &apos;s all gone .
walk it off , goldberg .
and so ended the worst losing streak
in finger @-@ football history .
what are you doing sitting in the dark ?
i had a terrible day .
i gambled pretty bad , and i lost .
well , hey , that &apos;s why you always keep
a spare pair of underpants in your locker .
that gem &apos;s for free .
no !
i lost my toys to garry ball playing finger football .
pops convinced me that i was lucky like him , but i &apos;m not .
i found this guy trying to hide under my bed .
i know you &apos;re scared , starscream .
so am i.
i &apos;m not sure what i &apos;m watching here ,
but at least you learned a valuable lesson .
all gamblers eventually lose .
not pops .
he always wins . it &apos;s like the man &apos;s magic .
except he does lose ,
and there &apos;s no such thing as magic .
you do know that right ?
so , you &apos;re saying my hero is just a regular old man
and there really is no magic in the world ?
yes .
no , no , no , no , no , no , no .
don &apos;t listen to him .
you just continue loving pops the way you always have .
your dad &apos;s the reason he gambled all his stuff away .
well , then pops will fix it .
i &apos;ll take him down to the school ,
he &apos;ll work his magical magic ,
and get it all back for you .
really ?
really .
really ?
really .
and with that , my mom rushed off to settle my gambling debts .
... 19 , 20 .
all right .
hit the showers .
and don &apos;t wear your underwear in there like a bunch of weirdos .
coach .
i &apos;m kind of going through some personal stuff .
do you have time to talk ?
i &apos;m not just your wrestling coach , goldberg .
i &apos;m your life coach .
now drop and give me feelings .
everyone in school thinks i &apos;m a joke .
maybe i am . i can &apos;t change that .
but being on tv is a game @-@ changer .
i was thinking if someone taught me some sweet dance moves ,
maybe everyone would look past who i really am .
why you coming to me for this ?
i remember you told me you took up tap dancing
to help you with your balance and flexibility .
not true . tap is for wuss @-@ bags .
i took modern . it &apos;s a man &apos;s dance .
so ... maybe you can help me ?
okay , son .
i &apos;m gonna tell you the same thing
i told my ex @-@ wife &apos;s lawyer --
you better bring everything you got .
let &apos;s dance .
and with that , coach mellor would train barry
to dance his way to local tv stardom .
with moves this flawless ,
erica and lainey would have no choice but to look past the pink
in barry &apos;s eye and into the fire in his heart .
oh , my god , it &apos;s midnight .
welcome to the first midnight of the rest of your life ...
... &apos; cause i taught you to dance .
and now you will succeed at the thing you wanted ...
whatever that was .
while barry had some new sweet moves ,
my mom was using some old ones on principal ball .
thank you for agreeing to meet with me on such short notice , earl .
you &apos;re welcome .
but technically , you just pounded on the door
while i tried to hold my breath
until you heard me gasp for air , then you barged right in .
look , i know you &apos;re in a tough position
being both principal and garry &apos;s father ,
but something very upsetting has happened between our boys .
the finger @-@ football fiasco . i am so sorry .
i told garry gambling in school will never be tolerated again .
so , i &apos;ll just swing by later and pick up adam &apos;s toys ?
oh , gosh no . garry won them in a bet .
so they &apos;re his toys now .
but you just said gambling at school was unacceptable .
completely .
however , welching on a gentleman &apos;s wager is even worse .
that is an important life lesson for our boys to learn .
but i think the take @-@ away here is you never bet against a ball .
oh , is that the take @-@ away ?
we &apos;re an unusually lucky brood .
well , why not put your money where your mouth is , ball ?
meaning ?
you may be lucky , but when it comes
to beverly goldberg &apos;s love of her children ,
she never loses .
if i win , i get adam &apos;s things back .
if i lose , i &apos;ll stay out of your office for a week .
mississippi stud , deuces and one @-@ eyed jacks are wild .
i only know the -- the game where you do
the flippy thing with the card and the highest one wins .
you want war ? you got it .
ace .
two ! damn it ! double or nothing .
king .
two ! damn it !
shall we go for a year ?
how did it go , bev ? did you strong @-@ arm him or what ?
i &apos;ll explain in the car .
i &apos;m not allowed on school grounds for the next decade .
hold on . let me just go in and charm the man .
it &apos;s my thing .
okay , fine , but listen to me very carefully .
under no circumstances are you to play war .
what happened to your jacket ?
that guy .
while pops and my mom needed a new plan
to get back my prized possessions ,
barry planned to win over lainey with his new dance moves .
oh , hello .
barry ? uh , what are you doing ?
now finish it .
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m saying this , but that was kind of hot .
welcome to the new barry ,
and the new barry &apos;s been working on his moves .
hmm . what &apos;s up , gang ?
i know .
i messed my teeth up when my face hit that locker
so doctor chang put me in some temporary braces .
did doctor chang do something to your hair , too ?
oh , no , i tried to cheer myself up
with a home perm , but ... i can &apos;t see good , so ... yeah .
well , good news is
the whole package kind of goes together .
yeah , you have this whole cat lady drifter thing going on .
shut up , will ya ?
i &apos;ll totally be camera @-@ ready by tomorrow .
uh , in light of your recent medical issues ,
maybe i should just go with barry instead ?
no . barry , you &apos;re my brother .
talk some sense into her .
do you want her to go like this ?
no .
i &apos;m sorry .
i did everything i could .
fine !
i don &apos;t want to go to the stupid dance party anyway .
i &apos;ll just eat my soft foods and go , hmm ?
dang it , where &apos;s the pudding ?
sorry , we &apos;re all out . got some pears , though .
i don &apos;t want a pear . i want chocolate .
again , we have no pudding . we have pears .
fine . you want me to take a damn pear ?
then i &apos;ll take all the pears , woman .
that way , you &apos;ll run out of pears instead of pudding !
for the first time ,
erica got a taste of what it was like to be her brother .
but none of barry &apos;s public meltdowns
ever rivaled my sister &apos;s pear @-@ throwing , pudding rant .
huh ? ! everyone gets a pear !
all right , show &apos;s over ! my office !
oh ! ooh , that &apos;s gonna be a tough one to walk off .
while erica was forced into detention ,
i was was forced to entertain myself with my backup toys from the &apos; 70s .
big news , little man .
guess who just won all your toys back .
it was me .
yeah , i did exactly whatever she &apos;s about to tell you .
really ? how ?
specifics aren &apos;t important .
what matters is that pops once again saved the day .
that &apos;s why he &apos;s your hero .
he really is .
what the hell is this ?
oh , that &apos;s one of those , uh , robo change &apos; em ups
you love so much .
this is a gobot .
i gambled away all my transformers .
and the difference would be ?
this is a transformer , and this is a gobot .
look at the obvious difference .
forget about the robots . look what you &apos;ve got here .
nintardo !
what did you just call me ?
no , it &apos;s the thing you play all day long -- nintardo .
oh , my god , are you combining nintendo and atari
into some horrible mom word ?
bev , enough . it &apos;s time we just level with the kid .
i , uh ...
may have gone to the toy store to replace your toys .
pops , why couldn &apos;t you just win it all back for me ?
that &apos;s the thing -- over the years ,
i may have fudged a few details about how much i &apos;ve won .
what are you talking about ?
i &apos;ve see you win so much at casinos ,
they shower you with the freshest seafood
the ocean has to offer .
first of all , that seafood i @-@ i @-@ is both frozen
and of the lowest quality .
and they give it to you when you bet aggressively and lose .
so , have you been fudging other things , too ?
no ... maybe .
what about all your legendary war stories ?
are those true ?
well , mostly .
did you karate @-@ kick mussolini in the face ?
no , but i was a very outspoken critic .
unbelievable .
my whole life , i thought that you were special .
but you &apos;re just a liar .
it had been an hour since erica &apos;s meltdown ,
and she was feeling the pain .
this is a nightmare .
well , why don &apos;t you let coach buck you up with a little story ?
please don &apos;t .
it &apos;s about an awkward and goofy @-@ looking caterpillar .
she had heart , she had spirit , but nobody saw it
because , on the outside , she had wild hair and a jacked @-@ up eye .
you &apos;re clearly talking about me .
no , i &apos;m talking about a caterpillar .
i &apos;m clearly the caterpillar .
anyway , this caterpillar , who is not you ,
eventually spun herself a little cocoon of confidence .
and then ...
what emerged was but a beautiful butterfly .
oh , my god !
y @-@ you &apos;re giving me the uggo speech .
that &apos;s the same story you tell all the dorks and losers .
wait , people know this ?
i know it &apos; cause you gave it to me in ninth grade .
really ? that &apos;s a heck of a long time to be in a cocoon .
i &apos;m a butterfly !
i &apos;m just going though some stuff , okay ?
well , then , let me tell you another story
about a lady who never got married ,
but she became one heck of a cool aunt .
i &apos;m a butterfly .
yes , you are ... under your skin .
here &apos;s a pudding . thought you could use it .
just go away . i don &apos;t want your pity pudding .
damn it . yes , i do .
okay , i talked to lainey ,
and we want you to come with us to &quot; dance party usa . &quot;
i can &apos;t go on tv looking like this .
i can &apos;t even go out in the world like this .
trust me , you can .
how would you know ?
honestly ?
this is what i feel like every day .
when i saw you freaking out in the cafeteria , i saw me .
and i realized i never want to see you feel that way again .
why are you being so nice to me ?
&apos;cause no matter how scary you look ,
you &apos;ll always be my big sister .
that &apos;s just so nice .
oh , god , don &apos;t hug me .
i need to hug you .
sure , erica and barry never really saw eye @-@ to @-@ eye .
but for the first time ,
they saw each other clearer than ever .
oh , look at you . you got all your crap back .
only &apos; cause i agreed to give garry
all of my desserts at lunch until we graduate .
you know , you were right . pops isn &apos;t a hero .
he &apos;s a fraud .
that &apos;s not what i meant .
listen , pops may not be magic ,
but he &apos;s a terrific grandfather and he &apos;s always there for you .
but he still lied to me .
he exaggerated . that &apos;s what all grandfathers do .
you know why ?
&apos;cause they want you to love them as much as they love you .
thanks to my dad , i realized that pops wasn &apos;t the lucky one .
i was for having him in my life .
hey , pops , what &apos;s with the bran cereal ?
don &apos;t you want to hit the waffle house and the museum ?
always .
i @-@ i just assumed you didn &apos;t want to go with me anymore .
just do me a favor
and give it to me straight from here on out .
deal . and i &apos;m gonna start by giving you this .
my grandpa gave it to me ,
and now i carry him with me wherever i go .
now you &apos;ll carry me with you .
and if that ain &apos;t magic , i don &apos;t know what is .
when you &apos;re young , it &apos;s easy to believe in magic .
come on , kid .
have fun with your grandfather .
oh , and no atlantic city !
that &apos;s right ! i know !
but as you get older ,
you realize the real magic comes from the people you love .
truth is , your greatest memories
are always the ones with family at your side .
sure , they may not be pretty
or turn out exactly as you planned .
in fact , some of our most embarrassing moments
lead to our greatest victories .
of course , at the time , it may not seem that way .
it &apos;s only when you sit down and take a good look back
that you can &apos;t help but smile
&apos;cause it &apos;s those very flaws ...
... that make the memories absolutely perfect .
happy to report the dorks and dinks are afraid to talk to me again .
all is right with the world .
well , now that you &apos;ve been on the other side ,
maybe you &apos;ll have pity for them .
what &apos;s up , gang ?
oh my !
got your stupid pink eye -- in both eyes .
and i was so upset i threw my hair dryer against the wall and broke it .
now i &apos;m so stressed ,
i think i may be getting a little pimple .
am i ?
there might be something coming in .
i &apos;m so sorry , barry .
if you don &apos;t want to be seen with me , i totally get it .
i &apos;m not gonna lie . i &apos;m super into this .
i love dating a weirdo .
that &apos;s right you do .
