I hate this.
Every year, every year it's like this.
Finally squeeze into a train to Union Square,
Couldn't fall down if you're shot.
Come on. It's impossible to catch a cab.
Peter, Peter...
Ah, thank you.
Yes, enjoy your day.
It's fashion week, Peter.
Embrace it.
Here we go. Excellent.
Good. Alright. Oh no.
Yes,alright.
Let me help you here.
Squeeze.
We're suppose to be interviewing our witness right now.
Peter, alright. Relax.
That's not gonna do it.
We're after an Israeli counterfeiter
Goes by the name of Ghovat.
We're going after "The Ghost"?
We're going after "The Ghost."
What do you know about him?
This guy is nefarious. He counterfeit treasury bonds, dollars.
He's rumors to be
The first guy to crack the microprinting on the euro.
Well, now we can add murder to that list.
Are you sure he called himself Ghovat?
Yes.
Okay.
What happened?
I was at the party.
Why were you there?
Many modals were invited.
It happened as I was leaving.
When I went for my coat.
I was in the backroom when the two men came in.
They were arguing.
They didn't see you?
I made sure to keep out of sight,
In the closet...
They started to shouting at each other.
Then suddenly everything went
very quiet.
The man who called himself Ghovat, I heard him leaving.
When I walk out that's when I saw the other man.
He was on the floor, already dead.
Okay.
Our men are gonna stay with you from now.
But if you need anything, day or night, you feel free to call me.
If you heard this man again, do you think you could identify him?
I will never forget his voice as long as I live.
Have you IDed the dead guy?
Fraud national out of Turkey. Known as associate of Ghovat.
Fallen out of our business.
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.
By working theory, this has something to do with fashion week.
Well, assuming our "Ghost" has something to sell,
Fashion week is a great cover.
He's got his all these buyers in New York this week,
With no bells going off.
Unfortunately, we've got 30,000 buyers.
We've also got someone who can identify his voice.
Are you gonna share?
You're gonna think I'm crazy.
That's never stoped you before.
We throw a party.
Is this your birthday?
No
You are crazy.
Look, Okay. Look at this.
Monte Carlo, Cannes, Ibiza, Rio...
This guy likes to have a good time.
We put women, booze, fashion All together in once.
And what do we do? Send him an evite?
He replies "Ghost" plus one?
No, we bring him to us.
We have Tara there in the room listening.
She can ID him.
Don't dance in the office.
A party?
The witness is confident she can identify him by his voice.
How do you know he'll show up?
We fill up with beautiful women.
I was addressing my case, agent.
Looking at his M.O., he has a thing for modals.
Yeah? Well, me too.
Hey Jones, do you like modals?
Love 'em.
Jones likes 'em too. Is there a plan in here somewhere?
Call me when one shows up.
Look
Caffrey, Ghovat,
These guys are cut from the same cloth.
Neal's convinced that our "Ghost" will show up.
I say we trust his instincts on this one.
We've never been this close to Ghovat.
I'll authorize five grand for this party.
You know, fifteen will be better.
We'll make five work.
Yes,and we get Elizabeth to help us.
My wife?
She an event planer, best in the business.
She'll work with us on the price?
My wife?
Your wife, his wife.
Don't hit me.
I'm sorry.
Wow, Royal ossetra caviar.
This is gonna be perfect.
Neal, I just found Sprinkbank.
Whiskey, perfect.
I got Garioch Scotch over here.
65?
No, 58.
Grab the case.
Alright,come on,we gotta itemize all this.
Twelve bottles of scotch.
Thirty-six tins of ossetra.
Booze and fish eggs, you got that?
Yeah.
Wow, drop the watch, convict. We're not on a shopping's break.
No, it wasn't for me, it's for you.
Oh, thank you, but there's nothing wrong with my old watch.
Honey, actually that looks great on you.
Well, a little out of my price range.
There's nothing wrong with enjoying the good things in life, Peter.
Then why do they always seem to end up in here?
Okay, so we've got the alcoho and the food covered,
Now we just need the venue.
Don't worry, I got that covered.
It's a loft.
Ceased in the DEA bust.
1,500 square feet. Service elevator
It's perfect.
Is that a chalk outline?
I'm sure they've cleaned that up by now.
It has everything you need.
Year, if five drunk frat buddies show up.
Aren't you supposed to be lining up super models?
64 and counting.
Oh, Neal Caffrey throws a party,
And 64 super models show up.
Sorry, my mistake, 65, actually.
These two are twins.
Is that another one of your super models?
No, it's just a friend.
He's got a place we can use.
You think your friend's place is better than mine?
Okay, it's better than mine.
yeah, okay
It's a lot better than mine.
Honey, I am really impressive of this place.
I mean I can have a state dinner up here. How did you pull it off?
He has a source.
But good luck trying to pry it out of him.
Sounds like fun, I'll work on him later.
She'll work on you later.
Hey guys, I got twenty minutes to get fiber optics in play.
I want a camera in every single entrance and exit,
Starting with that one right there.
Let's go.
Hello.
You're definitely in the right place.
You're also a little early
And you must be Neal Caffrey.
I am.
Would you mind waiting inside for a little bit?
Actually, I think I'am exactly where I'm supposed to be.
Then let me escort you downstairs at leaset.
No, I gotta say,
I expected a little more.
I mean, you are charming enough, but...
Who invited you again?
The agency.
I thought you were a model.
And I thought you were supposed to be one of the smart ones.
Neal, this is Agent Lauren Cruz
I just had her transfered here over.
She is gonna be keeping an eye on you tonight.
So where do you keep your gun?
Damn, Caffrey knows how to throw a party.
Hey, Agent Burke.
What?
Is that Miss March?
Jones, pull it all together.
Sports illustrated, not play boy.
Doing okay?
Come on, I'm with the most beautiful girl here,
I want to see her smile.
Neal. Straight ahead, red shirt,dark jacket,
Seems pretty jumpy for a guy to be at a party filled with models.
So, let's mingle.
Excuse me.
Hi, I saw you looking around, can I help you find someone?
I know almost everybody here.
Except for you...Mr...
Dmitri
Dimitri
Write down that name --"Dmitri."
I'm just...admiring the view.
Year, beautiful crowd, right?
Quite stunning.
Excuse me.
Yes.
No dice, Peter. Not our voice.
All right
Wait. He's speaking Hebrew.
What's he saying?
He's saying "I'm waiting where are you"
Ghovat is here. He's watching him. Ghovat's here.
Peter, he's here, he's watching Dmitri right now.
I got it.
Back me up, I need you to flirt.
What?
You're charming enough,right?
That guy right there.
Hey, I'm sorry.
You just look very familiar.
Sorry.
Do I know you from somewhere?
We need to leave.
Go.
How are you? Have you met...?
No.
Hello.
You know, my friend here, Isabella,
was noticing how fantastic your suit is.
We have to leave, unfortunately, but it was lovely to see you.
Have a good night.
I'm a model.
Where do you work?
Actually, you know what, I think you're right.
I think I don't know you. I'm sorry.
There he is.
I got it, I got it.
Move in, repeat, move in, now now now!
Get off me!
This is madness!
No, it's--it's not him.
Peter, we got the wrong guy!
You're not getting this thing off me?
I'm working on it.
You're lucky.
They have you on the 2-mile tether.
That's a lot in New York.
Remember Jimmy Dimako?
The Feds had his anklet set at 22 feet.
He had to take a shower with one foot out of the tub.
It's not true.
Ok, may be 30 feet.
But you have it better.
2-miles isn't enough, Moz.
I need to find Kate.
Man with the ring was with Kate in California.
You tell me what he wants from her?
Cause he didn't find what he was looking for in Santiago.
How do you know what he was looking for?
Because I told Kate I kept everything,
the money, the bonds, the arts, all of it in Santiago.
Well, clearly that's not the truth,
Because you told me
It was all hidden in Portland, isn't it?
Isn't it?
There is nothing hidden in either place, is there?
It's a test.
You told her Santiago, you told me Portland.
Then whichever rock gets over turned, you know who betrayed you.
Look, I just needed to know what I already knew.
What? That you can trust me?
Moz...
That I'm the one
Who's been there through all of it?
But kate-- Kate is the one who kicked over your rock
Kate didn't betray me, he forced her to.
Then why didn't kate try to warn you
When she came to say goodbye to you that day in prision?
I think she might have,
But I was too stupid to see it.
Here.
"Weep for me, my love."
"I'll miss you more" What is this
It's just an old love letter,
It doesn't mean anything, Okay? But...
The FBI was closing into us.
We started taking precautions.
We started passing codes.
That could be cracked by anyone
Who's ever seen the back of mad magazine.
Okay, you ask me why I don't tell you certain things
It's that attitude right there.
I'm trying to be supportive
Look, this was an early attempt.
Okay, we got more sophisticated as the Feds closed in
So you think when Kate came to say goodbye
To you at prision, she left you a code?
Look, I need to see the security tape.
Your friend at the FBI has access.
He's seen it
Oh, yeah, he's not just gonna hand it over.
You could... ask.
So, our ghost finally has a name.
It's Idil Hazeva.
Let's stick with "ghovat" for now.
Do we know anything more about him?
Not much, No criminal record.
Name's not coming up on any of our
International watch lists.
We can't find him register anywhere in town.
Anything about the girl?
She is a model. We're Looking at her.
What about Dimitri?
Andrei Dmitri,
Uzbekistan national, linked to a handful of enterprises,
Uh, arms trading money laundering,prescription-drug fraud.
Exactly the kind of guy you'd expect to show up at fashion week.
Yeah
Does he still think he got away clean?
Un, yeah. He slipped out the northwest exit.
Jones is sitting on him.
Tell Jones to keep his distance. I don't want him getting tagged.
Let's see where this guy leads us.
Good work
Thanks.
We'll reconvenein an hour.
Nice report.
Thanks
You know, you pull off the whole FBI thing, too.
Yeah, no one looks good in FBI slacks.
Oh, don't sell yourself short.
Better.
You sure I wasn't a little too direct and...
Yeah, but I like where you're going with it.
Where we headed for lunch?
Oh, uh, I'm gonna have to take a pass.
Elizabeth wants to meet me in the park.
Picnic. That's romantic.
Yeah, should I be worried?
Did you do something wrong?
Probably.
Show no fear.
Maybe she's just gotten used to spending time with you.
You think?
I'm not the better person to ask.
Hey Peter, before you go...
I need a favour
Yeah?
The last time Kate visited Mein prison,
Before she disappeared,
You saw that security tape?
Yeah.
I'd like to see it.
You think that's a good idea?
It's the last time I saw her.
I just want some closure
Help me wrap up this case,
See what can I do about this tape.
This is nice.
Right?
This is really nice.
Yeah, it'great.
Honey, relax. You are not in trouble.
Oh, thank god
Why do you think I asked you to have lunch?
I don't know. That was what scared me.
Okay, hold on.
I got you something.
You did?
Wow, it's a nice box
I noticed you were kind of looking at
The really nice watch at the Warehouse.
It's not as nice, but it's close.
It's perfect.
Okay, try it on.
That's a different kind of...
Yeah, just...
Different kind of latch, there.
Yeah, you go... There.
That's-- that's....
This is Burke.
All right, I will be there at, uh...
I'll be there in five minutes.
All right.
Look at that, It works.
It works.
Look good on you.
What's going on?
They're moving me now.
What, protective custody?
No one's threatening you.
They're not taking any chances.
Came here to get an agent, make contacts, not this.
Yeah. It's gonna be okay. All right?
If anybody can catch ghovat,
It's him.
Really?
He is the best.
Come here. I just got word from Jones.
Woo. New watch.
Mm, yeah, gift from Elizabeth. Thank you very much.
No sundial to clutter it up. Very nice.
What's Jones got?
Dmitri is at a fashion show.
Lucky him.
And guess who's with him.
Who?
Remember that model that was with Ghovat last night?
However you got us in here,
I don't want to know.
That's our Dmitry.
Guy always looks like he's waiting for something to happen.
Maybe he's waiting for Ghovat.
He lost his phone last night.
If that was his onlyconnection to him...
Figuring the only way back in is through the girl.
I'll buy that.
Want to go check it out?
No, I can't. I start flashing my bedge, they'll scatter like rats.
You trust me?
Nope.
Do you trust me talk to Dmitry?
What are you thinking?
Stand there and look menacing.
What?
Stand there and look menacing.
No,peter -- "menacing" -- you look like your kid just struck out.
What? This is menacing.
No, it's not.
What are you talking? It is menacing.
No, it's not.
It's menacing!
That's not it.
Okay, that's it, right there. Now cross your arms.
What are you doing?
I wanna let him know you're packing.
Yeah.
Now say, "I'll be back."
No.
Dmitry, right?
I never got your name.
No, you didn't.
What are you doing here?
Same thing as you are.
Just waiting for a chance to talk to our beautiful friend.
You enjoyed the party?
A little too much excitement for my taste.
Well,you know what they say?
"It's not a party till the police break it up."
Yeah, your little event may have attracted the wrong element.
As a matter of fact, my phone was stolen.
That can make it tough to contact people.
but there are always ways to get in touch with someone.
All right, let's cut the act.
We both know why we're here.
I don't know who you are, but you are way out of your league.
This game takes way more than money.
You're not the only buyer interested in what Ghovat is selling.
I'm the only one that matters.
You and your friend should take a walk.
He's definitely here to buy.
That girl could lead to wherever ghovat is staying.
I'll have Jones keep tailing them.
Hey, man, for the record, you're much scarier than other guy.
Much.
Looks like your boy Dmitry is setting into a hotel on Madison.
Think he's staying there?
Well, he ain't bringing any luggage with him.
Lock it down. Put somebody on every exit. I'm on my way.
Gotcha.
Anything?
No.
He's been in there for.. two hours.
Anybody in or out?
No, and I got two agents on every exit.
This is Burke.
Got a report of two men arguing on the 50th floor.
Dmitry is on the 50th floor.
Jones, get that room.
Damn it.
Sex games gone wrong?
No. Could just be a message.
Maybe he was trying to shut him up.
Yeah, but we don't even know Ghovat was here.
No, our "Ghost" was here.
Look, the knife wound matches the blade width and angle of
Penetration on our foreign national killed by Ghovat.
It's him.
Do we know how ghovat got out of the building?
Yeah. Found a service elevator down the hall.
Wasn't on the reconstruction blueprints.
which is exactly why he picked this place.
Yeah, this guy is good.
Why a dress?
I don't know. It's not off-the-rack.
There's no tag, which means it's couture.
We deal with a lot of knock offs.
Ask me what I know about a prada bag sometime.
Oh, look at this.
There's a slit here.
It's about the size of a electronic security strip.
A lot of the designers are building them into the clothes.
So, basically, it's a miniature flash drive?
Yeah, in theory, you could piggy back up to 4 gigs on one.
Well, that's enough space
To smuggle all kinds of information worth killing for.
Lauren, uh...
Gimme a photobook of all the designers who have showed this year.
Let's find out who made this dress.
I don't know who this Ghovat is.
You don't know his name? Hmm?
Not even by a rumor?
My world is fashion.
We both know that we're not talking about fashion.
I have a show this evening. I must be prepared for it.
That's on hold.
You have no reason for any of this.
Actually, I do.
Can you explain
Why one of your designs showed up at my murder scene?
You are the police. You tell me.
Whatever you did resulted in the death of two people.
And if I didn't do it,
My son will be dead also.
All right, what happened?
A few hours before my team and I are to leave tel aviv,
My wife calls, tells me that they have my son.
Ghovat kidnapped your child?
And then I was told to clear my shop
And wait for instructions.
And then he showed up,
told me I have to smuggle something into the states for him.
What was that something?
All that I know is that it was in the dress.
That's it.
After we cleared U.S.Customs,
I heard from my wife that my son is returned to us.
Alright look, two people were dead
Because whatever you helped bring in the country.
Is there anything you can tell me about it?
Well,
I can show you the real dress.
That's it.
I always make two dresses.
I didn't tell him he took the wrong one
That makes sense.
Dmitri shows up to get the dress from Ghovat
And finds out it's a fake.
He struggled, Ghovat manages to make it out alive.
So why kill him and bring all that heat?
He's trying to salvage the deal
but can't if Dmitri is running around
Telling everybody the technology is no good.
What do you think is on this thing?
Could be launch codes, covert I.D.
Formula for new coke, who knows?
But our technology guys
Will have an answer for us by tomorrow morning.
I don't know.
Something that valuable
There's no way Ghovat's gonna pack it up and go home.
I've got a thought.
Let's take our thread and go fishing.
How could you be so stupid?
Ghovat, please, you have to believe me.
I didn't know what you wanted me to do.
You, you didn't want me to know.
Where's the dress now?
It's gone. I sold it.
You sold the dress?
My dress?
Someone made an offer ahead of the show.
He bought it for his fiancee.
How much did he pay?
Fifty thousand dollars
Who did you sell it to?
How long will we have to keep this up?
Just long enough to get noticed.
You're doing great Tara.
I'll be doing better once this is over.
That dress really does look fantastic on you.
If only I could wear it on a runway.
There's nothing to say you won't someday.
Can I get you a drink?
New watch?
Yeah.
Excuse me, sir? This just arrived for you.
Hello?
I recognize you from the party.
Who is this?
I saw you steal Dmitri's phone.
Yeah, I was trying to eliminate the competition.
Guess it worked.
So you know what you have?
I know exactly what I got.
You paid fifty thousand for the dress.
I'll give you five million.
Aw, my fiancee loves it so much, how about we make it ten?
Do you know who you're talking to?
This is Steve, right?
I tried to be nice.
I tried to give you a choice.
Nothing on the phone.
It's a burner.
You can pick up one of these at any corner deli.
Prints?
It's clean.
Agent Burke
What's up?
We had two plain clothes taking Tara home.
Somebody got to them about a half-hour ago.
Got to them how?
Blasted the car to hell.
Fortunately, our guys were wearing vests.
What about Tara?
They grabbed her, got away clean.
I have your girl.
What's the dress worth to you now?
So, now what?
You want the girl, I want the dress.
Trade?
Where and when?
I'm not interested in meeting with you.
Then who?
Agent Peter Burke.
Why him?
Because it's really the FBI that holds the dress.
Is he there now?
It's for you.
This is Burke.
Sure you heard everything earlier.
You want me to make the exchange.
That's right.
I won't waste my time telling you to come alone.
Just make sure to bring the real dress.
If it's not, are you gonna make me eat it?
That's funny.
Keep this phone on you.
You'll meet me at the central park bench
tomorrow afternoon at 4:00 P.M.
Plenty of time for you to get your men into position.
You have to let me go to the exchange.
It's my fault Tara is in trouble.
I'm the one who paraded her around town in that dress.
The best thing you can do is
help me figure out what Ghovat's game plan is.
He knows we're gonna have the place staked out.
He knows you're running a playbook.
Right, so I'm gonna toss the old one, come up with a new one.
No. No, you don't. That's the point.
See, he's counting on the FBI to have a plan.
So I do nothing?
Go with him.
Like you would?
If he expects you to have a plan,
Don't have one.
Oh, that's the worst idea ever.
Prepare all you can. Just know it's all gonna change.
What would you do?
Go home and have dinner with my wife.
You meet this guy in central park
and you give him the dress and he gives you the girl?
That's about the size of it.
I'm really glad you got into the White Collar Crime division
Where nothing exciting happens.
It's... pretty dull stuff.
Yeah.
Um, I got you another present.
Honey, not another one.
I-I'm enjoying my first one. Don't...
It's my old watch.
But I-I-I-I love my new one.
Come on, honey, it'sit's big, it's clunky,
It moves around your wrist, and
I mean,it's beautiful,but...it's not you.
Take this.
I need you to be agent Peter Burke tomorrow.
And this --this is you.
Besides, um, when all this is over with,
I need you home at 6:00 right on the dot.
Thank you.
And Ghovat wants the dress
Because it's been tagged with a security device.
We cracked the thread this morning.
It's holding the holographic code of the latest European currency seal.
We're using a counterfeit code.
We're hoping he won't be able to tell the difference.
But if he does, this could go south fast.
We're putting this girl's life at risk.
We could put the entire monetary system of Europe at risk.
Guess who wins.
I'll be running point.
We've have eyes in the air, plain clothes on the ground.
Cruz, Jones, you're with me.
Burke, you know what you got to do.
Caffrey, put your hand down.
Put it down!
I'm just wondering where I'll be.
On a coffee run. You're not even supposed to be here.
Any questions?
Then let's get into position.
Are we good to go?
We are good.
Okay, people, let's do this.
Can I come in?
Get in here!
Close the door.
You're right on time.
I like to be punctual.
Well, that's one thing we have in common.
I don't see you.
Of course you don't.
He's signaling us.
555-3147.
He's giving us Ghovat's incoming phone number. Get me a trace.
Yep, I'm on it.
Good, Peter.
How do I know you have the girl?
I want to hear her voice.
Agent Burke?
Tara,are you okay?
Bethesda fountain. That's 300 yards.
You've got one minute.
If I see any of your agents or unmarked vehicles move,
the girl's dead.
Your time starts...now.
Everyone stay where you are! Stay down!
Everybody hold their positions.
We still got him on GPS, right?
Yeah.
Just stay down! Stay down! Stay there!
Standing down.
Go get the dress.
If you'll notice, agent Burke,
I've added a little fashion accessory of my own
To our model friend here.
The belt is lined with plastique.
I dial a number here... and she goes "boom.
Give her the dress.
Toss it.
Please don't try anything.
I have five bars
And free long distance.
I can be far away and still cause you pain.
Let him walk.
Even if he's bluffing, we can't take the chance.
Yes?
Hey,is this Steve?
What's up, buddy? You never call.
Son of a bitch.
All right, keep calling.
Jam his phone so he can't trigger the bomb.
Keep calling him!
Hey, Cruz... stay with Caffrey.
Everybody else, keep dialing.
Jam the phones!
Keep calling him!
We're jamming his call. Get the belt off of her.
Do it, do it!
Come on. Hold still.
Damn it.
Hey, Steve!
Now what?
That is pretty damn charming.
That's it. Good!
Everybody clear the area now!
Get down. Get down, get down!
You're actually doing the whole hero thing.
Yeah.
Yeah, they're gonna write songs about this.
Nice.
You okay?
Area is contained. Bomb squad is on the way.
I swept the leg. He went down.
You did? Excellent.
You don't look dirty.
Yeah, well...I know what I'm doing.
It was nice of your FBI friend to give you this.
There's no sound. Why are you shushing me?
Okay.
Does she always wear her hair parted that way?
Yeah, I'm way past that.
Wait.
Her scarf is forming the letter "M."
13th letter in the alphabet. 13 is a prime.
Thanks...rain man.
Do you want my help?
There it is. There it is.
How's your morse code?
"B..." "o..."double "t..." "l...""E.
Bottle.
