we are just now getting word of a plane
that has apparently crashed off the banks of the east river
here in new york . the plane ...
we &apos;ve received reports that fighter jets may have shot it down .
we &apos;re getting word that authorities
are asking the public to stay away from that area
to allow for emergency vehicles and first responders .
you heard me .
the man -- the pilot -- he was shooting people .
i hear two shots behind me .
i turn around -- i see the pilot .
he goes into the cockpit , and he shoots the co @-@ pilot .
people are panicking , screaming .
the next thing i know ...
i open my eyes , and this guy ...
the guy with the hood on his head ...
monster of a guy .
he &apos;s handcuffed to a guard .
and he &apos;s cutting his hand off .
cutting his hand off .
his hand off .
cutting hand .
纽约
at least you don &apos;t have to worry about immunity anymore .
you &apos;re never gonna go on trial .
you are going to disappear .
the girl -- agent keen --
was she worth all this ?
getting captured ?
that stuff you use in your hair -- is that brylcreem ?
my father used brylcreem .
yes .
&quot; yes &quot; what ?
the girl .
she &apos;s worth it .
sir , about reddington ...
my hands are tied .
he can help .
the crash , attack -- whatever it was --
i &apos;m sure it had something to do with berlin .
there &apos;s nothing we can do .
are we being decommissioned ?
you said after this case that you were finished ,
no longer willing to work with reddington .
is that still true ?
yes -- after this case .
well , there &apos;s your answer .
he can wait .
what do we know ?
prison transport -- eight dead at the scene .
ntsb says the plane was retrofitted with restraints .
two victims -- still unidentified --
were found cuffed to their seats .
survivors ?
witness accounts vary .
sightings have been reported from midtown to wall street .
what about a manifest --
an official record of who was on that plane ?
there &apos;s nothing official about this .
the faa say they were tracking a plane
that was supposedly a commercial flight
that originated in bogotá .
at 4 : 53,
they lost radar contact ,
transponders , radios .
they now believe that the flight plan was bogus .
altimeter readings indicate
they were flying below 3,000 feet
and along the borders
between various air @-@ traffic @-@ control centers .
they flew in radar dead zones
to fly undetected across american airspace .
nypd just apprehended two suspects in a carjacking .
they think they were passengers on that plane --
a chechen mobster wanted for arms trafficking in brazil
and a colombian drug dealer .
you question me about stealing a car ?
i was kidnapped .
... put on a plane .
i didn &apos;t know anybody else on the plane .
berlin ?
berlin ?
i &apos;ve never been to berlin .
i don &apos;t know anybody named berlin .
all i know is , they brought on some guy .
okay ? big guy . he got a hood on .
he was handcuffed to some guy -- a guard .
and he &apos;s got this guard attached to a handcuff next to him .
and then , when the plane is going down ,
the guy in the hood is telling the pilot what to do ,
like he was in charge .
mr. hood .
i don &apos;t know names . types , yes .
colombian , serbian , russian ...
how do i know there was a russian ?
besides being able to smell him ?
i saw his marks -- the tattoos .
those russians , they love their tattoos .
you want me to draw you a picture ?
despite a citywide manhunt ,
three of the prisoners from that crashed plane
remain at large .
local authorities are still on high alert after trading gunfire
with a barricaded suspect outside gramercy park .
he &apos;s believed to be one of the missing prisoners .
what the hell happened ?
did anyone else survive ?
they shut down the entire island -- bridges , tunnels .
the list .
that &apos;s everyone .
so , we &apos;re still moving forward ?
it &apos;s vital i speak to him .
yeah , that &apos;s not gonna happen .
he could help us .
the business with reddington holding a gun on you
didn &apos;t fool me .
you nearly fled with him as a fugitive .
i have no allegiance to reddington .
he killed my father .
but this man we &apos;re hunting -- berlin --
he &apos;s somehow in the center of all this ,
and my only objective is finding him .
reddington can help us .
you have a visitor .
hello , ray .
i got to tell you , ray , this concerns me .
i &apos;m in the intelligence business .
that means knowing things .
we tried to trace where that plane originated ,
where it was headed --
hell , even who it belongs to .
we &apos;ve come up dry .
why do i think this is connected to your adversary ?
perhaps if you had accepted my offer of alliance ,
neither of us would find ourselves in this position now --
you managing a massive intelligence failure
and national @-@ news spectacle
and me with this ...
enchanting view .
my people made their decision .
that said , i think they made the wrong one .
having you disappear into some black hole somewhere
doesn &apos;t serve either of our interests .
does that mean you intend to let the animal out of its cage ?
i &apos;m afraid it &apos;s not that simple .
the best i can do is give you a fighting chance .
i &apos;ve arranged a transfer .
that &apos;s all i need .
i can take care of the rest .
you know , every time we have one of these little talks ,
i wonder if it &apos;ll be our last .
but when i consider the odds ,
i usually figure you &apos;ll come out fine .
this time ...
i &apos;m not so sure .
you and your task force are now targets .
good luck , ray .
of course it would have to be you ,
because lady luck just adores me that much .
for the record , fitch ordered me to do this .
i hope you &apos;re killed in the attempt .
two shots at my jaw -- that &apos;s all you get .
so you better make it good , because if i am not k.o. &apos; d ,
you &apos;re getting a bullet in the temple .
well , i &apos;ve never been one to shy away from a challenge .
lizzy . listen to me .
you &apos;re in danger .
everyone on the task force is a target .
what are you talking about ?
there &apos;ll be time to explain later .
for now , pull everyone back .
you are all in danger .
get me ressler and meera .
sure about this ?
my sources confirm this is where he &apos;s holed up .
i &apos;ll check the v.i.p.
federal agent . hands on the table .
let &apos;s go -- now ! hands on the table .
i can &apos;t reach them . they &apos;re already in the field .
i need an address .
come on . put your hands on the table -- now .
i have eyes on possible unsub .
i think he made me . you copy ?
come back .
negative ! negative .
suspect &apos;s in cus--
ressler ! ressler !
find meera ! find her !
meera !
meera ! oh , my god . no !
no .
stay with me . stay with me .
the aircraft that crashed into the east river earlier today
is apparently being classified as a prison @-@ transport plane .
rescue officials report
that the cabin was retrofitted with restraints
with the capacity for 10 to 12 passengers .
no word yet on survivors .
meera &apos;s dead .
you said we were all targets .
why ?
the day we met ,
you asked me why i surrendered to the fbi .
there were many reasons .
one of them was berlin .
that &apos;s why he &apos;s here -- because the work we &apos;ve done
has forced him out of the shadows .
he can &apos;t allow the task force to continue .
meera was a casualty in a war
she didn &apos;t even know she was fighting .
i &apos;m afraid just by association ,
i &apos;ve made you all potential targets .
it was tom .
if berlin had the names of the agents in the task force ,
he had to have gotten them from tom .
sam &apos;s name was also in that book .
why ?
how is my father involved in this ?
it &apos;s all just pieces of a much larger puzzle ,
and until all the pieces are laying in front of you ,
it won &apos;t go together .
what i do know is this --
sam &apos;s involvement was as your father .
and no one can pervert or distort that .
right now , our task is to identify our enemy --
our enemy today .
berlin wasn &apos;t the only prisoner on that plane ,
and whoever wanted him wanted the others , as well .
you need to find out who that someone is .
i don &apos;t know .
this is america , yes ?
in u.s.a. , i get lawyer .
let me tell you how it works in the u.s.a. , dimitri .
you tell me who put you on that plane ,
where you were being taken ,
and i will do my best to protect you from them .
or i find out on my own -- which i will --
and when i do , i will turn you over
to whoever you &apos;re running from ,
let them decide what to do with you .
so , let me ask you again --
who put you on that plane ?
okay .
i love fbi .
i am want for arrest in russia .
i go to venezuela for hiding .
they find me there --
put me in car , take me to airport .
plane is already there .
i see it is not just me .
there are others .
we are not allowed to speak .
i don &apos;t know more .
who found you ?
this was an svr op .
this guy &apos;s a russian fugitive
being stolen back by his own country .
no wonder the damn plane &apos;s unmarked .
the russians are never gonna say a word about it ,
let alone release the manifest .
you want me to get the state department involved ?
no .
i want you to get reddington involved .
maybe he &apos;ll pay the russian ambassador a visit .
tuzik ?
tuzik ! come !
tuzik .
good evening , ambassador .
who the hell are you ?
no need to worry . tuzik and i are getting along splendidly .
care for a peach ?
i rarely enter someone &apos;s home for the first time
without bringing a gift ,
and there &apos;s a wonderful little produce stand around the corner .
i &apos;m calling the police .
mr. ambassador , as we speak ,
there &apos;s an unmarked plane being pulled from the east river .
i think we both know that plane is russian .
that plane has no ties to the russian government .
you really should try the peaches .
they &apos;re perfectly ripe -- and freestone .
unlike a clingstone ,
the pit of a freestone separates more freely from the flesh ,
making it ideal for consumption .
the prisoners on that plane -- i need the manifest .
i swear ...
if you hurt him ...
oh , my goodness , no .
i &apos;m not a monster .
you really think i &apos;d harm a dog ?
you , on the other hand ...
the manifest .
i just received it from reddington .
according to this , there were three guards .
two were killed in the crash .
the third is in i.c.u.
they &apos;re just bringing him out of surgery now .
based on everything we know ,
there were 10 prisoners on that transport .
three are in custody , four are confirmed dead ,
one of which is burned beyond recognition .
coroner &apos;s working to i.d. the john doe now .
that leaves three convicts at large .
alexei fayer , bogdan chrikoff ,
and vadim okecka .
one of them has to be berlin .
talk to that surviving guard .
bring photos of our fugitives .
nobody sleeps until agent malik &apos;s killer is found .
agent keen .
found it in evidence , from that first day .
you don &apos;t have to --
thank you so much . this is beautiful .
thought it might remind you of all the good we &apos;ve done .
no .
no , no , no , no , no , no .
look , we know the situation you &apos;re in .
the people you work for -- they know you &apos;re here ,
so whatever secret you &apos;re trying to protect --
we know about the man they call &quot; berlin . &quot;
we know he &apos;s one of those three ,
and we need you to tell us which one .
you don &apos;t know who you &apos;re dealing with .
why don &apos;t you tell us ?
i don &apos;t know his name . no one knows his name .
all i know is the story .
story ? what story ?
they say he started in the red army
and then the kgb ,
and he was ...
notorious for sending off ...
his enemies to the war camps in siberia .
then , towards the end of the cold war ,
some stories began to circulate
that his daughter had fallen in love with a dissident .
she was captured , imprisoned .
but , you see , the colonel -- he knew his way around .
he arranged so she could escape .
when the kremlin found out ,
they decided to make an example of him ,
so they sent him off to siberia
to rot away with his enemies .
it is said that they could hear him every night
praying for his daughter &apos;s safety ,
that she would never be found .
and one day , something arrived in his cell .
it was a pocket watch he had given his daughter ,
and inside was a picture of her .
and a few months later , something else arrived --
her ear .
and then a finger .
his enemies sent her back to him
piece by piece .
no one knows how he did it , but he did --
some say that he carved a knife
from one of his daughter &apos;s bones --
and slaughtered all the men
that had held him captive for so many years .
then he vanished ... disappeared ...
a ghost ...
hunting , searching
for the man responsible for his daughter &apos;s death .
the man you &apos;re looking for is not on those photos .
the man you &apos;re looking for was never on the manifest .
one of the most wanted men in the world
has escaped federal custody .
there are prisoners running free in the city .
a c.i.a. agent has been murdered .
where are you on the case ?
we &apos;ve got the plane &apos;s manifest .
unfortunately , our p.o.i. &apos; s not on it .
so you &apos;re nowhere ?
we &apos;re piecing it together .
the good news is
that reddington &apos;s escape from federal custody
has been contained ,
which means if keen is willing ,
the task force can continue .
you arrested reddington . he escaped .
now you ask me to meet in secret , off the record ,
so you can tell me you &apos;re willing to work with him ?
you let reddington get away . you want him on the street .
i don &apos;t .
people do .
what people ?
just get keen and reddington back .
what people ?
what do i care if some cop &apos;s dead ?
i &apos;m telling you , i didn &apos;t have anything to do with it .
no , no , no , no , no . no . no .
mr. hoodie is the guy that you want to talk to .
ask mr. hood .
we have an eyewitness .
you were picked up six blocks from the crime scene .
we have a bloody fingerprint inside the vehicle ,
surveillance from that club .
you have one chance right now --
who commissioned the hits ?
i want a name and location .
okay . all right .
funny thing , you know -- i used to be a real boy scout ,
strictly by the book , followed all the rules .
then this thing happens .
my fiance , she gets killed -- murdered right in front of me .
the guy who did it -- the only way i could get him
was to forget all the rules .
it was a real crossroads for me .
had to choose which path to take .
the thing is , i think it &apos;s real important for you to know --
the path i took ...
there wasn &apos;t any rules .
and the thing i realized was that sometimes ,
that &apos;s okay .
like ... when some greasy russian ...
starts murdering my friends !
i want a name .
i want a name !
milos pavel kinsky --
sometimes known as &quot; berlin . &quot;
he &apos;s a russian national , former spetsnaz commando ,
trained in the kgb &apos;s 45 division .
organized crime is now his fancy .
makes putin look like a christmas elf .
now that you know who he is ,
what exactly did you do to put him in such a bad mood ?
i &apos;m just as curious as you .
and you &apos;re here because ... you want ... ?
access .
the kind even the fbi doesn &apos;t have .
all those spinning satellites
that record every keystroke , every phone call ,
everybody &apos;s dirty little secrets .
you find him for me , and i &apos;ll do the rest .
i heard about harold .
find him .
they don &apos;t know if cooper &apos;s gonna make it through the night .
you still haven &apos;t told me how sam was involved in this .
the way sam told the story ...
was that one night ,
an old friend showed up at his door scared .
the friend told sam he was leaving town ,
that he was in danger ...
... and that he needed someone to care for a little girl ...
that her father had died that night in a fire .
so sam ...
... took the little girl in ,
and he raised her as his own ...
... always sheltering her from the truth about her biological father .
and that &apos;s why you killed him .
i killed sam because he was in pain and he wanted to die
and because i had to protect you from the truth .
what truth ?
the only memory i have of my real father ...
... is from the night of the fire .
i remember him pulling me out of the flames ...
... saving me .
yes .
and knowing his identity would put you in grave danger .
why ?
because he &apos;s ... a fugitive on the &quot; most wanted &quot; list ?
i loved sam , lizzy .
taking his life was ...
of all the ...
... difficult things that i &apos;ve done ...
... that may ...
may be the most .
but i did it
to keep you from learning the name of your real father ,
to protect you .
and you must understand -- having done that ,
i &apos;m certainly not going to tell you who he was now .
yes ?
i found him .
got a pencil ?
i &apos;m listening .
5152 katrine way .
was that your source ?
yes .
did he find berlin ?
we &apos;ll have to keep looking .
look out !
let &apos;s deal with the other female agent first .
then i want you to take care of the ginger .
you must be the one they call &quot; berlin . &quot;
no , the reports are wrong .
i don &apos;t care what the manifest said .
there was an 11th prisoner on that plane .
oh , you think i care about resources right now ?
this guy killed my partner . he gutted my boss .
i want you to get every agent with a badge
out looking for this damn guy .
you ...
meera ...
it &apos;s all because of me .
i must say , i &apos;m very good at finding people .
i &apos;ve tracked enemies far and wide .
i once found a hedge @-@ fund manager
hiding in the amazon with the yawalapiti
on the banks of the kuluene river .
you know what the key to finding your enemies is ?
remembering everyone &apos;s name .
it &apos;s critical to my survival .
anyone knows the head of some drug cartel in colombia ,
some politician in paris .
but i know their wives , girlfriends , children ,
their enemies , their friends .
i know their favorite bartender ,
their butcher .
i remember the name of the baker
i stole the strawberry bismarck from when i was 11 years old
and his wife-- trudy svoboda .
but you-- i have no idea who in the sam hill you are .
i have not a clue what i &apos;ve done to you ,
what i &apos;ve taken from you .
and yet , of all the people i &apos;ve hurt ,
none of them have come after me
with half as much vim and vigor as you .
i don &apos;t even recognize your face .
i &apos;m stymied .
and yet , here we are .
you found me .
through your weakness .
i searched for one for years--
a weakness that would allow me to get to you .
i nearly gave up .
and then i find out about her .
seemed so implausible
that someone so careful could be so careless .
and so i exploited it and waited .
and here we are ...
thanks to elizabeth keen .
hey , babe .
help me understand what horrible thing i did to you
that could possibly make all of this worth it .
who on god &apos;s green earth are you ?
what was that ?
being shot in the hand is just an absolute bitch--
all those little bones .
at least it goes right through .
worst part , honestly , is needing somebody to help zip your fly .
tell me your story .
i &apos;m not leaving here without a story .
being shot in the hip , on the other hand -- jiminy cricket .
thick bone , large artery ...
not to mention the fact that it makes walking upright
forever impossible .
just don &apos;t pass out . stay focused .
the story .
what did i do to you ?
how about the kneecap ?
the i.r.a. always loved a good kneecapping .
beirut !
beirut .
2010 .
the campolongo incident .
slide it .
slide the gun now .
no .
are you hurt ?
do it !
kill her !
pull the trigger ! do it !
now !
kill her ! pull the trigger ! do it now !
don &apos;t do it .
do you hear me ? !
tom . please .
shoot her !
this man -- he take everything from me !
for what ? for nothing .
for money -- business .
he snaps his fingers , and my life was --
well , that simplifies matters .
just the three of us .
tom , put the gun down
before you do something you &apos;ll deeply regret .
i &apos;m the one you want .
make the right choice , tom .
but make it fast .
because when i get over there ,
i &apos;m gonna take that gun away from you .
no !
we can &apos;t leave him alive .
please go .
i &apos;ll finish it .
this is between us .
do it quickly . i &apos;ll be waiting outside .
i &apos;m sorry .
what ?
authorities are now reporting
that all prisoners from that crashed plane
have been apprehended and they are in police custody .
in a statement issued moments ago from city hall ,
the governor congratulated local and federal ...
i told you everything i know .
i &apos;m telling you , i didn &apos;t have anything to do with it .
i told you everything i know . what more do you want to know ?
i didn &apos;t have anything to do with it .
how long you going to keep me here ?
indefinitely .
her kids were only 8 and 5 .
any update on cooper ?
the coroner , uh , just called in the results on the john doe --
the charred body found at the scene .
he wasn &apos;t a prisoner .
he had to be .
i mean , we accounted for everyone .
this report identifies him
as the third guard on the manifest .
what ? no .
i mean , the third guard -- he &apos;s in a hospital .
berlin cut his hand off .
oh , no .
what is it ?
he cut his hand off ?
he was handcuffed to a guard ,
and he &apos;s cutting his hand off .
... cutting his hand off .
his hand off .
cutting hand .
yeah , that &apos;s what all the prisoners said -- he cut his hand off .
no , no .
it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s a lexical ambiguity .
he cut his hand off .
berlin cut off his own hand ?
the guard .
the man you killed wasn &apos;t berlin .
yes , i know .
you know ?
how ?
he spoke of beirut 2010,
the campolongo incident ...
an unfortunate mess ,
but berlin &apos;s attacks on my business
started years earlier .
the moment he said it , i knew .
but you didn &apos;t say anything ?
berlin needs to believe i think he &apos;s dead .
it provides us with an advantage .
so , he &apos;s still out there .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll find him .
lizzy , there &apos;s something i want you to understand
about your father sam .
that night when he took you in ...
without hesitation ...
sam made a difficult choice
that changed the course of his life .
and that &apos;s where you find yourself now .
you can turn away and run from it .
you can hide from it .
and if you choose to do that , i &apos;ll fly away .
or you can face it and confront it ...
engage it .
and maybe ... maybe ...
you prevail and rise above it .
i understand .
i &apos;ll be on a plane tonight .
