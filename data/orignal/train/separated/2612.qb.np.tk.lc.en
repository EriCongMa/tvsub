i &apos;ve told you everything i know .
you &apos;ve given me pieces .
you &apos;ve helped around the margins , but i need more .
i need berlin !
how much do you think i can do from in here , liz ,
chained to the floor ?
you need to let me go ,
and then i can --
the arms supplier -- i want a name .
i can try to reach out to berlin ,
but as long as i am in here , i can &apos;t .
i want a name !
what month is it ?
november .
well , happy anniversary , liz .
you go to passionfish to celebrate ?
i &apos;m gonna freeze to death down here .
you know that , right ?
sevan .
sevan volkov .
he runs arms for berlin ..
he &apos;d be able to set a meeting .
that wasn &apos;t so hard , was it ?
so , what exactly did reddington say ?
uh , it was dembe .
he said red had another case
but he specifically asked that you come along .
does that bother you ?
why would it ?
i thought he only spoke to you .
don &apos;t want to step on your toes .
i &apos;m ... fine . my toes are fine .
ah , ladies , thank god you showed up .
i took a left turn in the rostropovich .
i &apos;ve ended up completely lost in the chico hamilton .
this is an addiction .
i just can &apos;t decide between --
please pour some cold water on me , will you ?
why did you want both of us here ?
both -- you &apos;re right . thank you . great idea .
anyway , funny story -- stop me if you &apos;ve heard it .
persian man walks into a bar ,
meets a beautiful woman , has a few drinks .
next thing you know , he &apos;s falling from a 12 @-@ story balcony .
i don &apos;t get it .
i imagine agent navabi does .
you &apos;re referring to kian nouri ,
the iranian businessman who committed suicide in dubai .
i am , except he wasn &apos;t a mere businessman .
he was one of iran &apos;s top nuclear scientists
in dubai to supervise purchase
of several borehole gamma something @-@ or @-@ others .
and he didn &apos;t commit suicide .
he was assassinated in a joint c.i.a. / mossad venture
to undermine iran &apos;s nuclear program ,
but , then , you know this already .
my understanding is , she took a little detour to dubai
for a rendezvous with mr. nouri
so she could toss him off a building .
you killed him ?
if you &apos;re asking me to comment on a mossad operation ,
you know i can &apos;t do that .
i wasn &apos;t asking . but i &apos;m hardly one to judge .
george orwell wrote ,
&quot; those who abjure violence can do so
&quot; only because others
&quot; are committing violence on their behalf . &quot;
what a visionary ,
but , good lord , his books are a downer .
in any case , the bad news is ,
i was sharing a bowl of shisha with a misiri minister ,
and they plan to retaliate .
you kill their top scientist ,
they intend to kill yours ,
and they &apos;ve dispatched
a man known as &quot; the scimitar &quot; to do it .
the scimitar ?
this is not your average killer , agent keen .
he &apos;s one part hit man , two parts con man .
i &apos;m familiar with his work .
in 2009 , his target was
a sunni tribal leader named majeed abd bawi .
the scimitar gained access by joining his militia .
oh , that &apos;s right !
fought for the man for seven months
until the day he got close enough
to aerate bawi &apos;s carotid with a fork .
he &apos;s dedicated , resilient , cunning ,
responsible for the murder of dozens of high @-@ value targets ,
and , according to my sources , he &apos;s already on u.s. soil .
harold , i &apos;m the assistant secretary of ncb .
i run point on all international nuclear matters .
if this guy was the threat you claim ,
he &apos;d be on my radar .
who &apos;s your source on this threat ?
a confidential informant
with an extremely reliable track record .
i &apos;m afraid that &apos;s as specific as i can get .
if i &apos;m right , what &apos;s our exposure on this ?
cloud top .
it &apos;s the classified designation for a warhead project design .
it &apos;s staffed by our top three scientists .
if any of them fell into the hands of a rogue nation ,
that country &apos;s nuclear program would advance decades overnight .
what kind of security protocols do you have in place ?
the dss provides them with false identities ,
social security numbers , even cover professions .
we hide them in plain sight ,
sort of a witness protection for high @-@ value assets .
that &apos;s not gonna cut it .
you need to pull these people off the streets
and into protective custody .
all right , harold .
i &apos;ll put two of them on lock @-@ down .
i can do that without drawing too much scrutiny .
and the third ?
that &apos;s gonna be a problem .
the d.o.d. asset is amalia collins --
senior engineer of our warhead design team .
when she &apos;s not on active status ,
she serves as a professor of astrophysics at duke .
it says here she &apos;s scheduled to deliver a talk tonight
at a symposium at the granville hotel .
d.o.d. &apos; s reluctant to call it off at the last minute
because of the scrutiny it would draw .
they feel it could put her in further danger .
you mean they &apos;re not gonna pull her ?
there &apos;s no indications the iranians
have any idea of her real value .
let &apos;s make sure it stays that way .
in the meantime , we need to track this scimitar
before he &apos;s able to i.d. our team .
uh , we need to talk .
i got things under control .
when &apos;s the last time you used ?
sitka , almost a week .
this happens all the time -- agents taking meds
to get over injuries and then they get hooked .
it &apos;s no big deal .
what are you gonna do , keen ?
tell cooper i &apos;m an addict ?
i want you to get help .
and i &apos;m telling you , i can kick this on my own ,
and if i can &apos;t , hell , i &apos;ll walk into cooper &apos;s office myself .
i got no problems with that .
i got your text . what &apos;s the problem ?
zebra mussels . fish and game are running
random inspections for invasive species .
zebra mussels . did they go inside ?
they tried to , but i held them off ,
but i don &apos;t know for how long .
we &apos;re gonna either have to move the boat or him .
talk to volkov ?
we have a meeting this afternoon .
i brought you some warmer clothes .
well , that &apos;s nice .
now you care about me .
is that it -- now you &apos;re , uh , concerned ...
for my well @-@ being ?
you can try and make yourself feel better
about what you &apos;re doing ,
but i told you ... the truth .
i delivered on my word .
so , when are you gonna deliver on yours ?
we &apos;ve been over this .
you help me eliminate berlin ,
and as far as i &apos;m concerned , this whole thing is over .
until then , enjoy the view .
liz ...
you can &apos;t keep me in here !
liz ! you can &apos;t keep me in here !
damn it , liz !
sevan volkov ! thank you for meeting with me .
and what choice did i have ?
berlin . i know you supply him with arms shipments .
and how do you know this ?
tell me where to find him .
if you know anything about berlin , you know i can &apos;t do that .
thought you might say that ,
which is why i nominated you for our &quot; most wanted &quot; list .
c.i.d. has approved it .
we &apos;re just waiting for the director &apos;s signature .
eh , if you &apos;re gonna arrest me , arrest me .
so you can sit silent in a cell with an expensive attorney ?
mm , i &apos;d rather leave you out there ,
let the world know we &apos;re looking for you .
once news of this hits the streets , berlin will know
the u.s. government is spending limitless resources and time
looking for you -- a man who has intimate details
about him and his business affairs .
you have two options -- either you lead me to berlin ...
or i lead berlin to you .
how exactly did you come upon this information ?
a c.i. , someone the bureau trusts .
i don &apos;t believe you .
if the bureau had a lead , they &apos;d follow it .
you came to this on your own ,
and you &apos;re hiding it from them , coming to me instead .
you &apos;d rather see berlin dead than arrested .
berlin killed meera . he nearly killed cooper .
he put tom into my life .
so if you &apos;re asking if i &apos;m okay with a lethal outcome ,
damn right i am .
yeah .
if you hadn &apos;t told me you &apos;d killed tom ,
i might think he was your source .
but i did kill him .
of course you did .
let me know when volkov gets a time and location on berlin .
i &apos;ll be there with bells on .
what &apos;s going on ?
d.o.d. discovered a hidden surveillance camera
at their annapolis field office during a routine sweep .
how is that relevant to us ?
technology was iranian .
what were they recording ?
okay , uh , the camera was placed outside the building
with eyes to the front entrance .
it was relaying a live stream to some off @-@ site location .
if i reactivate it , i should be able to triangulate the location
where the feed &apos;s being transmitted .
oh , man .
i almost forgot .
in case someone &apos;s watching on the other end .
okay .
camera is live .
okay , rdf is up . signal strength looks good .
oh , accounting for time lag .
and ...
we have a lock .
it &apos;s a property just outside new carrollton ,
and it looks like it &apos;s a construction site .
fbi !
clear ! clear !
trailer &apos;s secure .
lock it down . i want eyes on all access points .
so , where the hell is everyone ?
no idea .
but ...
could this be the man they were surveilling ?
jonathan reese .
agent jonathan everett reese ,
defense security services .
they &apos;ve got everything on this guy --
addresses , phone numbers , employment history .
dss is the division tasked
with protecting our nuclear scientists .
they &apos;re logging his movements .
probably trying to find the most vulnerable point of attack .
it &apos;s the dss shuttle stop .
he takes the train back from annapolis every afternoon .
he &apos;ll be at the park @-@ n @-@ ride off route 50 .
we got to get there before they do .
jonathan reese -- f.b.i. !
what &apos;s this about ?
we need to move quickly . i &apos;ll explain in the car .
shooter &apos;s on the ridge ! i don &apos;t have eyes !
i got threat assessments this morning
of a possible iranian misiri action .
they want the names and locations of cloud top personnel .
you need to notify your people , activate all security protocols .
sir , i think we have a problem .
i can &apos;t reach agents keen or ressler .
send a team to their last location .
find out what the hell is going on .
take it easy , agent keen .
you &apos;re at bethesda . i &apos;m dr. rivera .
you and your partner were in an accident .
is he okay ?
agent ressler suffered significant head trauma in the crash .
he &apos;s had a c.t. scan .
radiology will take him for an m.r.i. shortly .
my arm ?
fractured in three places .
we set it for now , but to be honest ,
you may need surgery to restore full mobility .
john reese .
the man who was in the car with us .
i &apos;m sorry ? nobody else was transported from the scene .
no , no , no , no , but he was in the car .
i &apos;m the attending on duty . no one else was brought in .
i need a phone .
easy .
listen ...
that crash was no accident .
understood .
i &apos;ll have one brought in right away .
we &apos;re seeing multiple 911 calls within the last hour .
they all report a black s.u.v. overturned
just under a mile from where they picked up reese .
cross @-@ reference with local police activity .
two passengers were pulled from the wreck
and evac &apos;d by ambulance to bethesda national .
only two ?
a man and a woman .
we have to assume
that &apos;s agent keen and either ressler or the d.o.d. employee .
meaning what -- one of them didn &apos;t survive the crash ?
agent navabi , i want you there as soon as possible .
i &apos;ll update mullen at d.o.d.
here you go .
thank you .
assistant director cooper .
it &apos;s me .
agent keen .
you have no idea how good it is to hear your voice .
are you okay ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine , but , uh ...
ressler ...
he &apos;s hurt .
the iranians have john reese .
i heard some men &apos;s voices before i passed out .
they were speaking farsi .
someone needs to find professor collins .
the d.o.d. needs to cancel that speech
and put her in protective custody now .
i &apos;ve already alerted the d.o.d.
i &apos;m heading to the event site myself
to make sure she &apos;s on lockdown .
agent keen , the neurology team at bethesda &apos;s one of the best .
they &apos;ll take good care of ressler .
agent navabi &apos;s on her way to you .
get some rest .
thanks for coming .
i got your message .
john reese was abducted
by the iranians a little over an hour ago .
we need to pull professor collins ,
and i need anything you can give me on reese
so we can get to him -- - harold , i checked .
there is no d.o.d. employee named john reese --
not in dss , not in any sector .
our people spoke to reese directly .
the iranians have his profile , his dss security badge .
thought it might be an alias , but it &apos;s not .
he doesn &apos;t exist .
uh , sir ? just got off the phone with bethesda national .
uh , the hospital has no record
of agents keen or ressler being brought in .
i just spoke to her .
how &apos;s everything in here ?
okay .
you &apos;re doing okay , hon ?
yeah .
what happened to radiology ?
they were gonna take him for another scan ?
oh , well , i &apos;m sure someone will be down soon .
he &apos;s your partner , isn &apos;t he ?
i understand .
i &apos;ll call them right now .
ma &apos;am , a @-@ agent keen , you can &apos;t be up .
we need to get the radiologist now !
oh , o @-@ okay .
okay , you &apos;re fine .
you &apos;re all right .
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
we need to get radiology in --
let &apos;s get you back in bed .
you &apos;re fine .
oh , my gosh , i &apos;m so sorry !
i &apos;m so sorry .
it &apos;s all right .
you just relax .
we need to get radiology .
okay , take it easy. take it easy .
thank you .
i never eat anchovies unless i don &apos;t know i &apos;m eating them .
but i have to say , this is pretty delicious .
anchovies get a bad rap .
try the wine .
it would be better with beer .
it might very well be better with beer .
do you have kids , kenneth ?
i do -- a daughter .
the two of you close ?
it &apos;s complicated .
she doesn &apos;t like anchovies ?
you know , i don &apos;t know about that .
i wish it were that simple .
my father --
he and i ...
my father did things i hated him for .
things that were ...
unforgivable .
have you told him ?
i haven &apos;t seen my father ...
in a long ... long time .
what have you done ?
it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s okay .
i &apos;m not gonna hurt you .
we got played . the scimitar created john reese ,
which means we didn &apos;t find that construction trailer .
we were led there .
everything in that trailer
was designed to make us think john reese was dss .
why ?
so when we lost him ,
we would think the identity of our scientist was in jeopardy .
this was all done to trigger a reaction .
they isolated keen and ressler , made them believe
that losing reese was a threat to national security .
this was all a con done to expose amalia collins .
so , where the heck is agents keen and ressler ?
someone needs to find professor collins .
the d.o.d. needs to cancel that speech
and put her in protective custody now .
we ran the name as soon as we heard it .
there &apos;s an astrophysics professor named amalia collins .
she &apos;s speaking today -- granville hotel , downtown d.c.
丹尼尔 · 里维拉
you need to move quickly , sir .
good news .
radiology called .
they &apos;ll be down for your partner in the next 20 minutes .
oh , that &apos;s great . thank you .
what &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s just a little something
so that arm of yours doesn &apos;t get infected .
you tell me what &apos;s in the syringe ...
... or i will stick it in you and find out for myself .
it &apos;s a sedative . please don &apos;t .
what &apos;s in his i.v. ?
same thing .
okay , who are you ? where is this hospital ?
doctor !
ressler ? ressler ?
ressler ? ressler ? ressler ?
can you hear me ? we got to get the hell out of here !
they &apos;re definitely not at bethesda .
cooper went to secure professor collins .
uh , i traced the call liz made to cooper &apos;s cell .
their rerouting and encryption are incredibly sophisticated .
this is gonna take hours to untangle .
okay , so , what &apos;s next ?
cooper &apos;s pulled six teams from other assignments .
he sent them --
hello ?
dembe , it &apos;s agent navabi . we have a situation .
come on .
we got to go now .
it &apos;s been over two hours .
i don &apos;t need to tell you his reputation .
once he has the intelligence he needs --
yes , i know , agent navabi .
tell me about this lead of yours .
he &apos;s not my lead . his name is ali hassan .
he &apos;s the target of a major mossad initiative .
i have a slight but memorable acquaintance with mr. hassan .
mossad has been tracking his movements for months .
my superiors believe
he &apos;s the key to unraveling a dozen covert iranian opts .
but you think he knows where to find the scimitar .
perhaps .
mossad has no tolerance for any agenda except mossad &apos;s .
you &apos;ll be sanctioned for this indiscretion .
so be it .
i can &apos;t work with this task force
unless my partners are my highest priority .
so this has become quite personal .
i understand .
but you may have an even more personal stake in this case
than perhaps you realize .
and why is that ?
because one of the scimitar &apos;s little @-@ known aliases
is walid abu sitta .
walid abu sitta is the man
who ordered the bombing that killed my brother .
yes .
that &apos;s why i brought this case to you .
there .
what was that ?
you hear that ?
farid , what &apos;s going on ? !
farid ? !
hassan ! i love this club !
son of a bitch !
carbon fiber ?
reddington , stop !
stop !
damn it !
what have you done with my guard ? !
farid is taking a rest .
keep your plum covered . we &apos;re not alone .
i &apos;ll take your weapon .
i &apos;ve always regretted sparing your life
that night in the strait of hormuz .
but i see pity has its rewards . live and learn .
you &apos;ve been very careless , ali .
my unit has been surveilling you for months ,
and the intelligence we &apos;ve gathered has been very helpful --
so helpful that i fully expect to be disciplined
for coming here without authorization .
just by being here , i have everything
and , therefore , nothing to lose .
what do you want ?
the scimitar .
my friend here thinks you may know where to find him .
he would &apos;ve needed support when he got to the states .
i &apos;m guessing that support came from you .
i know what you must be thinking , ali .
imagine your future , the rest of your life
spent in a dismal israeli prison ,
some dark hole they put you in ,
bending your fingers and pulling your toes
until they forget you ever existed .
think carefully , ali , because , as you are my witness ,
that future will seem very bright , indeed ,
if you don &apos;t tell us what we want to know .
he did make contact .
asked to use one of my warehouses .
said he needed building supplies .
for what , i don &apos;t know .
tell me about this warehouse .
keen !
reddington , i have them .
新时代新模型
director cooper ? owen doherty .
we spoke on the phone .
where are we ?
well , we went ahead
and canceled the event , initiated evac protocol .
we &apos;ve placed collins in a holding room .
does she have a security detail ?
yes , sir .
two on the door .
take me to her .
who is it ?
ms. collins ? fbi .
i need you to open the door , please .
professor collins .
you are going to pay the price
for the crimes committed by your government .
but first ...
you &apos;re gonna help us create the weapon
that will be used to bring this country to its knees .
you said there were two men posted outside the door .
there were .
on my ready .
clear .
not here , sir .
let &apos;s just hope she &apos;s still in the building .
nobody leaves until we find collins .
collins is missing . cooper thinks she &apos;s still on site .
okay , listen up , folks ! we have a situation here !
we need everyone to move inside !
now ! let &apos;s go !
move into the lobby ! sir ? !
sir ?
sir , don &apos;t move !
hands where i can see them !
slowly !
hello , agent keen .
i see you &apos;ve made a spectacular recovery .
we &apos;ve suffered a setback .
no , no , no , no , no . i &apos;ll need the full package --
new credentials , a safe house , and 50,000 --
no .
i &apos;ll need it within the hour .
all this running around . really ?
i &apos;m so relieved
when the people i &apos;m chasing ... come to me .
agent navabi , you got my message .
we were just admiring the view .
how did you know ?
mr. hassan provided for our friend before ,
and most criminals return to the same trough
time and time again .
indolence , i suppose .
personally ,
i make it a habit to avoid habits .
i can call it in .
yes , i suppose you can .
the question is , do you want to ?
i offer him to you as a gift .
what am i supposed to do with him ?
whatever you like .
nobody else knows he &apos;s here .
agent keen just called .
her source provided berlin &apos;s location .
forgive me . i have an appointment that can &apos;t be rescheduled .
don &apos;t do anything i wouldn &apos;t do .
you &apos;re lying .
if you think your beloved brother
was just another faceless young man in that crowd ...
you know nothing .
i will kill you .
like kian nouri ?
the scientist you murdered last week in dubai ?
what do you know about my brother ?
there &apos;s no country insisting you do your duty .
if you kill me , it &apos;ll be cold @-@ blooded murder .
so , call the mossad or the c.i.a. ,
or whoever &apos;s coming and be done with it .
i thought for a second we might lose you back there .
prospect of having to live without me ...
must &apos;ve been terrifying .
it was .
the irony is ...
with all the drugs they pumped in me ,
this is the best i &apos;ve felt all week .
what about that ? is that gonna be a problem ?
i just got a call from mpd harbor patrol .
they fished a man &apos;s body out of the anacostia .
matches your description of the scimitar .
get there .
yes , sir .
i &apos;ll catch up .
♬ lord , now the rain done come ♬
♬ lord , now the rain done come ♬
that &apos;s him .
shot point @-@ blank to the head . this was an execution .

♬ muddy water ♬
he gave us a location on berlin .
♬ oh , now the rain done come ♬
we &apos;ll see how that pans out .
the information i gave you ...
is good .
volkov will lead to berlin .
♬ baby , don &apos;t it feel so bad ♬
reddington will kill berlin .
♬ oh , baby ♬
and my value to you ...

i know you were expecting volkov ,
but as luck would have it , he sold you out to agent keen .
it &apos;s surprising she came to me instead of the bureau
with the hope that i would kill you .
i have other plans .
first , understand i didn &apos;t have to come here alone .
in fact , i didn &apos;t have to come here at all .
i could &apos;ve sent seven men and put an end to this war .
why didn &apos;t you ?
because this entire affair ,
every ounce of pain and suffering
that all of us have endured has been the result
of a tragic and , frankly , mysterious misunderstanding --
one i intend to correct .
there &apos;s not much left i truly cherish in this world ,
but i swear on those few things i still hold dear ,
i did not kill your daughter .
words , words .
the greater the words , the larger the lie .
my daughter is dead .
but yours ...
my men tell me you &apos;ve been spending a lot of time together .
maybe , when i &apos;ve done to your daughter
what you did to mine , we can finally be even .
i &apos;m sorry .
is this the daughter you &apos;re referring to ?
because she &apos;s not my daughter .
she &apos;s yours .
