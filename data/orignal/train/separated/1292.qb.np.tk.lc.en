of a doctor in an upscale bellev hill neighborhood
in west roxbury shocked and terrified
this tight @-@ knit community ...

dr. isles , what can you tell us
about the murder ?
i &apos;ll have a statement for you later tonight , kitty .
detective .
what &apos;s up , doc ?
evening , dr. isles .
hello , casey .
dr. maura isles , chief medical examiner .
come on , it &apos;s your lucky day .
can &apos;t say this on camera ,
but we call dr. isles &quot; queen of the dead . &quot;
what &apos;s that , crowe ?
oh , jeez , take a mind off .
commander cleared you ?
what &apos;s it to you ?
it &apos;s my case .
since when ? i &apos;m up .
i got clearance . move .
i just spoke to the commander .
it &apos;s my case . where &apos;s frost ?
losing his lunch ... where else ?
god .
he should &apos;ve stayed in robbery .
hangnails make him gag .
that guy gives us a bad name .
hey , come on . leave him alone .
you okay , buddy ?
something i ate .
where &apos;s the crime scene ?
follow your nose . might bring back some memories .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
you &apos;ll see .

hands hurt ?
it &apos;s gonna rain .
rizzoli , homicide victor 825 .
going back for more , frost ?
wow . not in south boston anymore , dorothy .
korsak , i thought you were on vacation .
cut it short .
that bad ?
worse .
oh , man .
10 centimeters .
jane , if you got this ,
i can start processing the rest of the house .
yeah , go ahead .
carotid artery and jugular have been transected .
what &apos;s odd is how precise it is .
hairline fracture of the nasal bone
above the lateral nasal cartilage .
it &apos;s not disfiguring .
looks pretty disfiguring to me .
can you pop this out for me ?
can &apos;t you do something safe ,
like yoga ?
might hurt a little .
okay .
okay .
ow ! &quot; a little &quot; ?
put some ice on it for the next 24 hours
so you don &apos;t look like mike tyson .
victim is dr. martin yeager , 34 .
wife , gail , is missing .
diamond was too small so she whacked him and walked out ?
no . we found signs of forced entry .
well @-@ to @-@ do couple .
man is bound and posed . woman is missing .
and a teacup .
is he out ? is the surgeon out ?
oh , my god . korsak ?
he &apos;s not out . it &apos;s his m.o. , that &apos;s all .
why didn &apos;t you warn us , warn jane , at least ?
i wanted your unbiased assessment .
looks like hoyt , right ?
korsak , we put that son of a bitch behind bars .
you tell me how this is possible .
it &apos;s not . i spoke with the prison authorities .
he &apos;s in lockdown .
look , stun @-@ gun marks ,
right there , just like hoyt &apos;s victims .
any sick perp could &apos;ve done this
if he watched the tv news and read a paper .
we got a copycat .
except we didn &apos;t release this detail .
hoyt &apos;s trained an apprentice .
hey , uh , can i get a scanner from you ? thank you .
he &apos;s coming out of rigor . you want us to crack him ?
no , put him on his side .
hoyt &apos;s the reason you don &apos;t want to be partners , isn &apos;t he ?
you know why ...
i &apos;m allergic to all those sad and furry little creatures
you keep rescuing , detective dolittle .
you never sneezed .
hello .
special agent gabriel dean .
you must be detective rizzoli .
and you must be dr. maura isles .
what &apos;s the fbi doing here ?
saw the homicide advisory ... and possible kidnapping .
we have an apb out on gail yeager .
yeah , so do we .
you get a lot of routine advisories .
what so special about this one ?
hey , you know we &apos;re on the same side , right ?
are we ?
oh , because , you know , you fed boys ,
like to show up , take the bat and the ball .
just here to observe .
right .
jane , i &apos;ll be doing the autopsy in the morning .
okay .
come if you like .
hey , rizzoli .
yeah ?
semen .
so he raped the wife and made the husband watch ...
just like hoyt .
look at me . look at me !
jane ... how lovely to see you .
haven &apos;t seen you since the trial .
get his ass in the chair .
i like that scent --
the smell of lavender and fear .
see one . do one . teach one .
that &apos;s what they taught you in medical school .
who did you teach , hoyt ?
i dropped out , jane . i mean , you know that .
you were kicked out ... for fondling a corpse .
that &apos;s very good , jane .
you &apos;ve learned how to irritate me .
i want to see them .
hands are so useful .
dexterous .
and yours played the piano . do they still work ?
good as new .
so ... your turn .
you trained somebody , didn &apos;t you ?
i love ...
your neck .
it &apos;s so beautiful .
and your breasts ...
very firm .
answer the question .
tell me , jane ...
what would you like to do to me ?
i &apos;d like to get my gun ...
... and put it in your mouth and pull the trigger .
no , no , no , no , no .
it is so much better slowly , to take your time .
you know , all my life ,
i &apos;ve been meticulous about finishing what i start .
and that bothers me ,
because i haven &apos;t finished what i started with you .
and you won &apos;t , you sick scumbag .
do you dream about me , jane ?
because i dream about you .
i don &apos;t even think about you .
but i &apos;ll tell you what -- i &apos;ll visit you every damn day
if you tell me who your friend is .
who killed dr.yeager , where &apos;s his wife ?
i see that our time &apos;s up .
i do dream about you .
am i ever your lover ?
that &apos;s enough , you son of a bitch ! that &apos;s enough !
all right , all right , all right .
you &apos;re right , jane .
i should play fair .
my friend is out there .
enjoy him .
because he &apos;ll enjoy you .
rizzoli .
yeah , ok . we will be right there .
they found gail yeager .
hey , uh , i &apos;ll catch up .
are you wearing lipstick , rizzoli ?
shut up .
dog find her ?
yeah . lucky he got loose .
we wouldn &apos;t have found her till summer .
who &apos;s a good boy ?
how &apos;d you get here so fast ?
i was in the area .
everybody &apos;s so lucky today .
vitreous potassium .
helps us determine postmortem interval .
nice and clear -- about 36 hours .
look at the body , the way it &apos;s laid out --
like she &apos;s taking a nap or reading a novel .
it &apos;s odd , isn &apos;t it ?
yeah , why didn &apos;t he bury her ?
didn &apos;t have time .
that means something .
where &apos;s frost ?
ah , paperwork .
oh . wiping his face with it after he puked ?
did you do a wet prep yet ?
i hadn &apos;t planned to . but i can .
those little guys really are swimmers .
quite fresh .
deposited postmortem .
how did you know ?
i didn &apos;t .
yes , you did .
it &apos;s not standard procedure
to check for evidence of necrophilia .
you want to tell us why you &apos;re really here ?
i &apos;d like a copy of your report -- as a courtesy .
let &apos;s go , hoyt . you got your one hour on the yard .
he &apos;s faking . be careful .
i found carpet fiber on gail yeager &apos;s body .
lab is processing it .
thanks .
hoyt didn &apos;t meet his apprentice in prison
or medical school -- all 80 classmates are clean .
you guys eating cat food ?
yeah , you want some ?
no .
guess it &apos;s a chick thing .
what &apos;s up ?
you may want to sit down .
no . tell me .
a few hours ago , uh ,
charles hoyt escaped custody .
oh , my god .
why wasn &apos;t he cuffed ?
two doctors have assured me he was suffering from appendicitis .
200 milligrams of decadron
would give him an abnormal white @-@ cell count .
it mimics all the symptoms .
doesn &apos;t explain how he got out of here .
what &apos;s he doing ?
it &apos;s a message for me .
go stay with mom and dad .
no . i am staying in my own home .
he &apos;s not gonna do this to me again .
frost , go get some sleep .
i &apos;m fine .
if i was a guy , you wouldn &apos;t be worried like this .
you &apos;re not a guy .
no , i am a homicide detective .
and he is not gonna kill me .
really ? well , he almost did the last time .
i mean , look at your hands !
hey , frankie , come on .
please take him .
we &apos;ll be outside .
all right , all right , that &apos;s the way you want it , fine .
but if you have a boyfriend over , we &apos;ll know .
how &apos;s that ?
hey , marisa .
i &apos;m so sorry . did the vacuum cleaner wake you ?
no , no . i was up studying .
uh , come in , come in , come in .
how &apos;s law school ?
awful .
remind me again why i thought i wanted to be a lawyer .
i know , right ? &quot; where the hell was i on career day ? &quot;
just making sure you &apos;re okay .
um ... yeah . why would you ask ?
you always vacuum when you have a really tough case .
no !
mom .
that lipstick doesn &apos;t flatter you . it &apos;s too pink , babe .
bye .
i hope frankie junior &apos;s okay down there .
hoyt &apos;s not after frankie , ma .
your father &apos;s out there , also .
oh , my god , did you bring the dog , too ?
why would i bring the dog ?
what , ma ?
oh , come on , it &apos;s the middle of the night .
who could sleep ?
ever since you had this crazy idea
to become a police officer ,
i haven &apos;t stopped worrying .
i never know if you &apos;re coming home .
and your brother frankie wants to do exactly what you do .
everything you do , he follows it .
i &apos;m leaving .
you &apos;re leaving ? where are you going ?
someplace where you &apos;re not .
jane .
jane , come on . be reasonable .
they don &apos;t pay you enough money .
i mean-- they don &apos;t pay me at all .
why do you always look like
you &apos;re about to do a photo shoot ?
thank you .
god , what is that ? !
shh . you &apos;ll scare him .
he &apos;s alive ?
his name is bass .
geochelone sulcata -- african spurred tortoise .
i &apos;ve had him since he was like this big .
he &apos;s partial to british strawberries .
&quot; bass &quot; ?
what , after an old boyfriend ?
william m. bass , the forensic anthropologist
who founded the famous body farm .
right , yeah , that -- that bass .
no , it &apos;s okay .
yeah , he &apos;s a great pet . really interactive , i &apos;ll bet .
so , how long can a person go without sleeping ?
hallucinations begin by day four ,
followed by slurred speech , short attention span , and death .
you &apos;re better than wikipedia .
well , wikipedia is frequently incorrect .
very little is rigorously peer @-@ reviewed .
somebody &apos;s just dropping something off .
hey .
go away . i &apos;m asleep .
are we having a sleepover ,
or is this your way of telling me you &apos;re attracted to me ?
so it was dean you were expecting .
he wanted my opinion on another case .
what case ?
i can &apos;t say .
fine . go sleep in your own room .
jane ...
did you ever like the same guy as your best friend ?
no .
did you ever have a best friend ?
no .
you &apos;d tell me if you were a cyborg , right ?
no , i don &apos;t think i would .
i &apos;m not seeing him .
yet .
well , somebody should , don &apos;t you think ?
yup .
should we draw straws ?
couldn &apos;t we just show him our tits and let him decide ?
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s just bass .
really , it &apos;s okay .
i &apos;ve never been so scared in all my life .
you look like you slept under an overpass .
how are you still single ?
you got to stop this .
stop what ?
this stuff with frost .
lab identified the carpet we found on the victim .
it &apos;s called antron .
it -- it &apos;s not frost &apos;s fault that he was partnered with me .
navy @-@ blue carpet from a car .
you want to hear what i got from the lab or not ?
yeah . you want to drink the coffee ?
navy blue &apos;s a popular color .
2 million vehicles with this type of carpet fiber .
swell .
hey , it &apos;s not my fault it &apos;s a popular color .
i take three sugar .
oh , for christ &apos;s sake , since when ?
since i don &apos;t know -- since for a while .
you &apos;d know that if we were still partners .
what about the semen we found ?
no hits .
how is that possible ?
easy . our unsub &apos;s not in codis .
ran the prints we had , too -- nothing .
our unsub &apos;s a ghost .
pardon me -- yours and frost &apos;s unsub &apos;s a ghost .
thought you said you take three sugar .
doctor says it &apos;s bad for me .
two sugars is bad for you . the creamer is bad for you .
like you care .
that &apos;s it .
hey .
about the other day ...
i should &apos;ve given you a heads @-@ up .
it &apos;s okay .
no , it -- it &apos;s not .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry , too , korsak .
rizzoli .
where ?
okay , page frost .
i got to go . they found another victim .
his name is john ghant . his wife , karena , is missing .
no sign of a teacup this time . you know what that means .
he didn &apos;t need a warning device
because he had an accomplice .
hoyt .
jane ?
you better come see this .
hey , all i know is ,
i got a delivery for a detective , uh , rizzoli .
that &apos;s me .
don &apos;t worry about that .
let me see some form of identification .
i got it in my back pocket .
-祝福 亨利 · 德都波图敬
hoyt .
then who &apos;s henry deduboto ?
&quot; ted bundy . &quot;
that &apos;s five letters too many for that anagram .
how do you do that ?
fine , &quot; theodore bundy . &quot;
he was fascinated with necrophilia ,
just like the apprentice .
i bet that &apos;s why gail yeager &apos;s body
was laid out like his lover .
so he could visit .
any time he wanted .
but we found her , so he had to kill again ,
this time with hoyt .
my guesss karena ghant is his new girlfriend .
frost ?
where ?
keep it off the radio . take his phone .
hide your car , all right ? i &apos;m on my way .
you are not gonna like what we &apos;re about to do .
only call he made was to 911 .
dispatch put it straight through to me .
good . what was he doing way out here ?
looking for indian arrowheads .
&quot; native american . &quot;
the wampanoag tribe was the last to inhabit the area ,
also known as the massachusett .
get him to a uniform . take him downtown .
hold him as long as you can . call korsak , all right ?
get him out here . tell him the plan .
i &apos;m on it .
what plan ?
we &apos;re gonna surveil this body .
what , you -- you mean , leave her here ?
yes .
i said you wouldn &apos;t like it . let &apos;s go .
no . i &apos;m calling my team .
maura , they weren &apos;t expecting anyone to find this body .
look at where she &apos;s hidden . okay , hear me out .
hear me out . we get the hell out of here .
we put both the park entrances under surveillance .
what makes you think that hoyt isn &apos;t watching you right now ?
he might be . i am willing to take that gamble .
what , by leaving this body here
in hopes that they &apos;ll return ?
no . no , every second she stays here ,
more forensic evidence is lost .
maura , please .
the faster we get out of here ,
the better chance we have of not being discovered .
okay ? &apos; cause if we don &apos;t do this , we got nothing .
if we take this body back now ,
all we &apos;ll find out is , &quot; yup , she &apos;s dead .
and they killed her . &quot;
please .
do this for me .
you still got the north entrance , frost ?
affirmative .
if you want to go sit in his car , go ahead .
shut up .
excuse me ?
not you .
and if they come , they &apos;re coming at night .
so keep your eyes peeled , all right ?
roger that .
what is the smell ?
what smell ?
you know what smell . there &apos;s an animal in here .
ugh ! something licked me . what is it ?
oh , it &apos;s just jo friday .
he &apos;s filthy .
&quot; she . &quot;
&quot; joe &quot; ?
&quot; jo , &quot; like &quot; josephine . &quot;
found her by the side of the road this morning .
hey , you sneezed .
i told you , i &apos;m allergic .
korsak , it &apos;s either him or me .
what ? please don &apos;t .
hey , what about him ?
&quot; her . &quot;
she stays . i got to pee .
you &apos;ve got to be kidding me .
nice ... doggy .
my god , what have you been in ?
you got to go . you got to go .
later that same day . come on !
korsak ?
hey !
korsak ?
korsak ! come on !
stay down . stay down !
stand ! put your hands on your head now !
hey , it &apos;s me .
what the hell are you doing here ? !
i ... i was chasing hoyt .
what do you mean , you were chasing hoyt ? !
how &apos;d you even know he was here ? !
rizzoli .
korsak ?
hello ?
little help over here . officer down .
officer down .
officer ...
hey , man .
officer down , officer down .
give me that .
where are you ?
on the other side of the creek .
what &apos;s your location ?
he snuck up on me .
okay , okay .
you &apos;re gonna be fine . are they coming ?
yes , they &apos;re coming .
okay .
i &apos;m sorry .
you &apos;re gna be fine . you &apos; gonna be fine .
let &apos;s go .
push the ambulance here , quick .
guess where i &apos;ve been .
how &apos;s korsak ?
fine .
no , he &apos;s not fi ... he &apos;ll be fine .
you told agent dean where we were , didn &apos;t you ?
i did .
without telling me ?
i &apos;m sorry .
really ? you &apos;re sorry ?
because i treated a senior federal agent like a perp .
tackled him , maura , in a creek .
well , that &apos;s unfortunate .
but there is a fine line between courage and stupidity .
yeah , a fine , thin , blue line .
thank you .
what ? you have a turtle .
tortoise .
whatever .
well , at least give her a bath .
did you actually tackle him ?
yes , like a linebacker .
very professional .
you &apos;re very brave .
no , i &apos;m simply tired of being afraid .
how did you get past frost ?
he didn &apos;t .
thank you so much .
if you &apos;re looking for an apology ...
i would know to look elsewhere .
fine , okay . i &apos;m sorry .
would you like coffee ?
sure . that &apos;d be great .
your place is really nice .
you sound surprised .
what , like i live in a sterile little hovel
with my dead plants and my tv dinners ?
so ...
question .
why did hoyt come after you ?
hoyt &apos;s first victim was mine .
and in case you hadn &apos;t noticed ,
i seem to be hoyt &apos;s favorite type ... female .
oh , yeah , i noticed .
and what happened to your hands ?
why are you so interested in this case ?
that &apos;s &quot; need to know . &quot;
seriously ? you fed guys actually say that ?
i bet you never even once
considered leaving the force , did you ?
sure , i did ...
when hoyt had me pinned to the floor
and a scalpel to my throat .
and now there are two of them ,
hunting me down like a pack of wolves .
you want me to stay ?
hmm ?
no .
no .
i mean , i don &apos;t mean no . i mean no .
like , no .
okay . all right .
well ...
thank you for the coffee .
all right .
thank you .
okay .
good night .
&quot; no &quot; ?
god , ma , give it a rest .
have you been here all day ?
yeah .
whoa , good .
more caffeine .
uh , what &apos;s my ringtone ?
nice and upbeat .
you should talk to your mom .
she &apos;s still mad at me
that i won &apos;t come home and sleep in my pink canopy bed .
mm . i always wanted a pink canopy .
i wanted a horse .
please don &apos;t tell me that
you always wanted to dissect dead people .
okay , i won &apos;t .
i have to go
to the forensics lab at quantico tomorrow .
in the middle of this ?
it &apos;s connected to this .
right . yeah , here we go again .
why are you part of the &quot; need to know &quot; loop and i ...
he &apos;s trying to kill me .
jane , this ca--this case is a lot bigger
and it &apos;s far more complicated than we thought .
i want to tell you .
great . fill me in .
i &apos;ve been ordered not to .
it involves national security .
are you kidding me ?
jane . jane !
jane , where are you going ?
i &apos;m sorry . am i being a little too loud for you ?
do you ever relax ?
no , i don &apos;t ever relax ! and you know what else ?
i &apos;ve had it up to here with your &quot; need to know &quot; bullshit .
i &apos;ve heard &quot; bullshit &quot; before .
senator sam conway ,
chairman of the armed services committee .
detective rizzoli .
sit down .
where is this ?
kabul , afghanistan .
it looks like hoyt &apos;s work .
a war zone is a serial killer &apos;s paradise .
our apprentice is a soldier ?
when we first started investigating these killings ,
they looked like war crimes .
so you withheld crucial information
so you could watch
the dumb boston cops run around in circles ?
you can blame me for that .
this is a very sensitive investigation .
we believe the apprentice finished his tours ,
came to boston to find hoyt .
so they could kill together .
that &apos;s what it looks like .
wait . wait , no .
if our apprentice was a soldier ,
we would &apos;ve gotten a hit on his fingerprints or his dna
in the military database .
we didn &apos;t get a hit .
you ever heard of sheep dipping ?
no .
it &apos;s when the cia borrows a soldier
for a black @-@ ops mission .
green berets were sheep @-@ dipped .
their identities were wiped from all databases .
so they wouldn &apos;t be recognized as american military .
so you think our apprentice
was a green beret working for the cia ?
yes .
so we train our best men to be killers ,
and then we &apos;re surprised when they are .
i hate that he &apos;s a soldier .
no , that &apos;s it .
that &apos;s the connection .
what ?
you wouldn &apos;t know it &apos; cause it wasn &apos;t in the file .
hoyt used an assumed name to get into
a combat medic training program at fort stewart .
that has to be where they met , right ?
yeah , that &apos;s worth a shot .
let &apos;s fly to fort stewart in the morning .
and ... and cross @-@ reference hoyt &apos;s records .
we &apos;ll nail both these sons of bitches .
uh , did you eat dinner ?
i can &apos;t remember .
well , are you hungry ... for food ?
agent dean ?
excuse me .
yeah .
what is it , maura ?
jane ...
i &apos;m in your apartment .
why ?
jane , they &apos;ve been ... they &apos;ve been in here .
i &apos;ll be right there .
jane , you were right .
called in a favor ,
got some records from fort stewart .
our apprentice is
special forces officer john stark , 32 .
he did three tours in afghanistan
as part of a direct action force .
what unit was he assigned to ?
618 , medical care specialists .
oh , my god , that &apos;s the same as hoyt .
stark lives at 400 chestnut hill square .
i &apos;m already sending units .
okay . uh , i &apos;ll get there as soon as i can .
detective rizzoli .
yeah .
dr. isles asked if you &apos;d i.d. the body .
what body ?
sorry , thought you knew .
dr. isles said it was your neighbor ,
young female , 20s .
marisa ?
oh , god , no .
no , come on . no , no .
hello , jane .
so nice to see you .
you looking for this ?
you know , your problem ...
is that your heart ...
rules your head .
