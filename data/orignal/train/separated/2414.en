He's dead.
No, no! I can't, I can't!
Turn it off.
Her humanity, Damon.
That was all she had left.
Humanity means nothing
when you don't have anyone to care about, Stefan.
I know how to bring Jeremy back.
It's called an expression triangle.
I need to complete it for Silas.
The nutty professor has got her totally brainwashed.
You've had 36 people killed?
No. I've had 24 people killed...
12 people at the Young farm, 12 hybrids.
You and I are gonna complete the triangle.
Well, I was looking for answers,
and all I found was your professor Shane, dead.
I think Silas followed us back from that island.
You and I, we are the beginning.
The cure. I know someone has it.
Katherine.
The doppelganger?
where are you right now?
In the boonies looking for a dead vampire
that might lead to Katherine and the cure.
Damon?
Will?
Hey, buddy.
Everyone just needs to stop telling me
that I need to feel.
Be honest. You like me better like this.
So where are we going?
A place every newbie vampire
Should go at least once in their life.
New York.
You were right.
Told you.
That was really good.
Yeah?
Glad you liked it.
Yeah. Thanks for inviting me.
Do it again next weekend?
If you're lucky.
Oh, god. Is he--
Do you think he's dead?
I don't know.
Stay there.
Oh, my god!
You're that serial killer, aren't you?
The son of Sam.
Son of Giuseppe,
but close enough.
No!
You dragged me all the way to New York
because you were feeling nostalgic?
No. I dragged you to New York
because in a matter of 3 days
you managed to piss off everyone in Mystic Falls.
A little more difficult to do in a city of millions.
I was hungry.
You were reckless.
Emotionless. There's a difference.
Look. All that matters is that when I lived here
I fed like crazy and had a blast
and went undetected for years.
So we're just here to have fun?
What's the catch?
There's no catch.
Look. You wanted out. I got you out.
You wanted to feed,
I brought you to a city-sized all-you-can-eat buffet.
That's the beauty of New York.
There's so much life
that a little death goes unnoticed.
Come on. Let's go get some lunch.
Wait. What do you mean you took her to New York?
And that tone is the reason I didn't pick up the phone
the first 20 times you called.
Where is she now?
Out exploring. Maybe she's eating a hot dog...
vendor.
So I take it your search for Katherine is off.
Relax, man. This little joy ride is actually a cure hunt.
That vampire that Katherine sent after Hayley is a friend of mine.
He lived in the city.
Will gets vampires fake identities,
and I'm sure that Katherine's one of his clients.
And Elena's ok with this little field trip?
Just yesterday, she was living the vampire high life.
She doesn't want the cure.
That's why I didn't tell her.
Damon, if she finds out you're still looking for it,
she'll bolt.
I'm aware of that, Stefan.
What I'm hoping is she's gonna be so wasted on booze and blood
that she won't even think about it.
Don't underestimate her.
If I can handle you when you flip your switch,
I can handle her. Trust me.
Listen to me. She's ruthless without her humanity.
The cure's the fastest way to get it back.
Just be a good brother and keep Mystic Falls afloat for me
and let me do my thing.
You've got an immortal named Silas to deal with, remember?
Desperate times I take it.
What are you doing here?
Not judging you for starters,
although if you are determined to get drunk,
then perhaps I might recommend something a little more sanitary.
Well, then. You showed me.
Shouldn't you be out chasing Tyler to the ends of the earth,
or are there some hopes and dreams
you want to crush around here?
Depends. Do you happen to know where the young Brutus is?
I know where he's not--with me.
He gave Matt the deed to the house,
so he's gone for good.
Tyler made it his life's mission to kill me.
You can't hate me for driving him away.
No. I can, and I do.
Now if you don't mind, I'd like to get back to spiraling,
so go away.
Actually, I asked him to be here.
We need his help. I think Silas is in Mystic Falls.
Ok. Come on. Take a deep breath.
And 5, 4--
I can't do this.
Bonnie, relax, ok? Trust me.
How can I trust you if you won't show me your real face?
Don't you think it's a little creepy
that you're appearing as my dead professor?
I told you that I'm Silas,
I told you Shane died on the island.
I'm trying to earn your trust.
All right. Look.
You invited me into your home, right?
Why?
Why'd you lie to your friends and tell them everything was fine?
Why did you convince your dad
that you needed Professor Shane's help to control your magic?
What am I doing here?
You're in my head.
You're making me see things and do things.
Hey. Now. See? Look. I'm strong,
But you're a witch,
and I can't force you to do anything
that you don't already want to do.
You care about Jeremy, right?
I do.
Yeah. You were with him,
and you promised to protect him,
but you failed,
And now in order to bring him back...
I need to get rid of the other side.
You are descended from Qetsiyah,
one of the most powerful witches of all time.
Only you can complete the triangle
and cast the spell.
Completing the triangle means killing 12 people.
12 people you can bring back.
Bonnie, you can do this
for Jeremy.
So some blood went missing from a few hospitals.
What about Elena?
Don't vampires with their humanity off
tend to overindulge in human blood,
Or were you the exception?
It's not Elena.
Well, let's say for a moment that it was Silas.
I'm struggling to see how this affects me.
Look. Silas wants to die and be reunited with his one true love,
but he's supernatural,
so if he takes the cure and dies,
he gets stuck on the other side.
How Shakespearian.
But if he destroys the other side altogether,
he can take the cure, die, and pass on,
but in destroying it,
every dead supernatural being
will return to our side.
That means every werewolf, every witch,
every vampire.
I wonder how many of those you personally killed.
Care yet?
My interest is piqued.
How do we stop him?
Bonnie said Silas needs to complete 3 massacres to do this spell.
Before professor Shane died,
he convinced the pastor to blow up the council.
Next, he had you kill your hybrids,
and now he only needs one more massacre,
so if he's here, that's what he's doing.
We need to find him.
Looks about right.
I was promised hedonism.
Well, it's early.
Hedonism isn't a big fan of the sunlight.
Or soap.
Easy, judgy.
Not everybody got a hot new haircut today.
Give it a couple of hours.
This place will be crawling with more punked-out nihilists
than you can eat in a decade, trust me.
How do you know?
Because I spent most of the seventies here.
The factory was too clean,
CBGB's was too high-profile,
but Billy's-- Billy's was
the underground of the underground.
1, 2, 3, 4!
There you go.
Two for one. Rock 'n' roll.
That's the third 5'7" brunette I've gotten from you, Billy boy.
Is that the same client?
She's a runner.
Some vampires need more identities than others.
Hey! Watch what you're doing!
What the hell?
Hey. Be discrete.
I kill people and give you their I.D.s,
you let me feed in your club.
Discretion was never part of the deal.
Lexi?
You're gonna feed on him right here?
You're getting sloppy, Damon.
You got Lexied?
Following a lead without me?
Poor form, Damon.
I have to say I'm a little hurt, Damon.
I thought we made a good team.
Not without its fireworks, but what classic pairing isn't?
Wait. What the hell are you talking about?
Damon's following a lead to the cure.
I'm following him.
Notice your name never came up.
You're doing what?
How does it feel to be wrong all the time?
I brought Elena here to feed.
I mean, Mystic Falls isn't exactly vamp xanadu right now.
Right. So you drove 7 hours to New York city?
Yes, and as I was explaining to Elena
before we were so rudely interrupted,
that my history in this city
has a particular resonance to her current situation.
When I had my humanity off.
That explains it.
Your switch is flipped.
Ugh. Would you mind?
I can't even hear my prey over your constant babbling.
You're not even covering your tracks.
We heard about you back in Mystic Falls.
So Stefan sent you.
Hmm. I thought we were on the off part
of our endless on-again, off-again,
eternity-of-misery cycle.
Lucky for you he cared just enough to send me.
So why'd you flip it?
What traumatic event was too much for Damon Salvatore to handle?
"Leave it to beaver." The fifties bored me.
Well, it's the seventies now,
and keeping it off is gonna get you caught and killed.
And I'll take my chances.
I won't. I promised Stefan--
Look. You and Stefan have a thing. I get it.
He falls off the wagon, you pick him up.
He's redeemed, you get your Florence Nightingale jollies, ok?
Well, I'm not him.
I don't need or want you.
Too bad because you got me.
Wow. She sounds dreadful.
She had a mother Teresa complex.
So let me guess.
After many dark nights with Lexi,
she convinced you to turn your emotions back on,
And that's exactly what you plan to do with me. Hmm.
You read the last page of a book first, too?
I'm gonna get a drink, many drinks.
So you really buy all this?
Not one bit.
I know he's after the cure.
I'm not stupid.
Well, let's not say things we don't mean.
Damon is like a dog with a bone.
Stefan, too.
They won't give up until they find the cure
and then make me take it.
So I guess I'm gonna have to find it first.
You're playing him.
No. He's playing me.
I'm just returning the favor.
What are we even looking for?
Well, if Shane really was working with Silas,
chances are he was helping him plan his next move.
Where, on his evil villain to-do list--
steal blood, perform 3 massacres,
pick up dry cleaning?
Actually not to nit-pick,
but we evil villains usually use minions
to pick up our dry cleaning, that sort of thing.
Why is he necessary again?
Well, we don't know what Silas can do,
so if we do have to go head to head with him,
an original hybrid who can't die
might come in handy.
Besides, Stefan and I work well together,
or at least we did in the twenties.
Well, granted my emotions were off.
And that's why you were more fun
just as Damon is probably relishing
in Elena's emotionless company in New York.
My brother knows what he's doing.
Does he?
Don't underestimate the allure of darkness, Stefan.
Even the purest hearts are drawn to it.
Still, I'm sure it will all be fine.
I think I found something.
"Symbolic figures in the dark arts."
Didn't Bonnie talk about expression triangles?
Here.
"In some schools of magic such as expression,
"Human sacrifice can be used as a focus for power.
"It's rumored that the addition of two supernatural sacrifices
"Compounds the mystical energy,
creating an expression triangle."
Humans--
That was the council fire.
Demons--Klaus' hybrid failure.
Well, I wouldn't exactly call it a failure.
What's the third?
Oh, no.
You want me to kill witches?
We've been over this.
It's temporary. They'll come back.
What if I'm not strong enough?
You are strong enough.
Look. It won't be easy.
Once they realize how strong you are,
they'll channel each other one by one using spirit magic
till they can strip you of expression.
You have to endure them
until al 12 are linked as one.
Listen. Your dad's here.
We have to convince him.
Hey. How was the session?
To be honest,
not that great.
The meditation isn't really working.
Here magic's too strong.
You told me you could help her.
Dad, it's-- it's not his fault.
Not his fault? He's the one who taught you this magic,
and now he can't control it.
Listen. We have an idea.
I'm done listening to your ideas.
I want you to get out of my house.
Dad!
We just call on the spirits.
I want you out of my house!
Wait!
What the hell is happening to her?
This happened to my wife.
Expression consumed her.
She had no control.
I need you to call mom.
We need witches,
a lot of them.
Is this allowed?
What would Lexi say?
Lexi thought the only way I would turn my emotions back on
was if I started enjoying my life again.
Do not tell me she took you to Bon Jovi concerts, too.
No. Wrong decade.
Lexi was not allowed to feed with Stefan.
I didn't have that problem,
and neither do you.
I'm hungry.
Pick.
Don't scream.
Your turn.
Packrat.
Thanks, Will.
Is it just you?
This place wasn't easy to find.
Figured you wouldn't want to draw attention.
It will work.
I'm Aja.
You friends with my mom?
I was.
After she became a vampire,
we didn't have a whole lot in common.
So she's not coming.
This is witch business.
Look. I know you're scared,
but I've dealt with expression before.
I know the hold it can have on you.
It's not that.
I'm just-- I'm strong.
You won't be able to do this alone.
Oh, honey, who said anything about being alone?
There's almost nothing as strong as a full coven,
so I brought 11 of my closest friends.
Won't be fun,
but we're gonna cleanse you.
You ready?
Let's do this.
Leave.
Looks like Damon gave us the slip.
Good. Hopefully he'll find whatever he's looking for,
and then I can take it.
And what if you can't?
I mean, he is stronger than you.
You know, I could help you.
You want the cure off the table,
I want to take it.
We could work together.
Work together? Don't you hate me?
I hated the moral, self-righteous version of you,
but this one's not so bad.
Maybe it's your new haircut.
Do you remember what it's like to be human--
Weak, fragile?
Why would you want to go back to that?
Because someday, I want a family' of my own.
And that's exactly why I don't want your help.
The best part of having no emotions
is that I can think rationally.
I'll do whatever it takes to get this done.
You're the opposite, a pile of neuroses and insecurities,
hopes and dreams.
You're basically one big emotional variable that I just don't really need.
You just made me miss the old Elena.
There's been two massacres.
Pastor Young's farm is here,
and the old Lockwood cellar,
where you spitefully slaughtered 12 of your own hybrids,
is here.
According to the book,
the expression triangle
is equilateral,
putting it here.
Somebody's been skipping their geometry classes.
There are actually two places
where the third massacre could be.
Well, you didn't let me finish.
Hey. What's going on? Did you find Bonnie?
No, but I talked to her dad.
I think I found Silas.
Call out to the sprits, Bonnie.
Let them in.
Phesmatos tribum--aah!
I can't. It's hurting.
It hurts! Ohh!
It's because you've rejected the spirits.
The expression's consumed you.
Phesmatos tribum nas ex viras...
I changed my mind.
Purgal animum sous...
I don't want to do this anymore!
Obscarus!
Let me go!
She's fighting. I need help.
Link with me.
Lend me your power.
Phesmatos repallus tantian...
Maltuscanum anium par vas.
We need more strength!
Phesmatos repallus tantian
Maltuscanum anium par vas.
So Silas is appearing as professor Shane.
Wouldn't be my first choice.
Well, it would be if you needed to brainwash Bonnie
into committing a massacre.
You need me to come home?
No, we got it.
How's the cure search going?
Well... not great.
I mean, it's no massacre in the making,
but Rebekah trailed us here.
Then in addition to my buddy being a brilliant identity thief,
he's also a hoarder.
What are you trying to find?
Will had a repeat customer, 5'7" Brunette.
Said she was a runner.
Katherine.
Turns out I was helping her run from me.
Ironic.
Problem is I'm pretty sure
that his filing system goes by birthdate,
but I can't for the life of me remember Katherine's.
June 5, 1473.
And that, brother, is why you are the better boyfriend.
Well, will you look at that?
It's all her former addresses,
including a couple from the last two months.
I mean, they're mostly P.O. Boxes,
but, hey, it narrows the search.
Well, you're welcome.
So you headed back now?
Yeah. Tomorrow morning.
Got to keep up the ruse for the terrible twosome outside,
pretend like I'm having a good time.
And you're not?
I'll tell you tomorrow.
Sorry. I needed some quiet.
Couldn't hear Stefan over the Runaways 2.0.
Let me guess. He's worried.
Jealous mainly.
He's having acid flashbacks of me and Lexi in the seventies in New York.
I'll tell you about it over a drink. Come on.
Lexi stuck with me for months,
partying with me, showing me a good time,
but late every night, she'd torture me in the worst way possible.
Tell me about her.
No.
What did she look like,
what did she sound like?
Tell me everything you remember about her.
Every night.
And that's my cue.
You have a nice fight.
Try not to break anything.
Every night.
Every night, we get wasted,
and the second I bottom out,
you have to bring up Katherine.
Because you loved her,
and love is the most powerful emotion.
If I can just get you to remember how you felt about her...
I don't want to remember.
I mean, why do you care so much?
Do you remember how we first met?
It was 1864.
Stefan had just killed you father,
made you turn into a vampire,
and he was killing his way through Mystic Falls.
You hated him.
Rightfully so,
but before you left, you asked me to help him
because no matter what happened,
he was still your brother,
and you cared about him.
Now you need help, and he cares about you.
We both do.
Let me help you.
Tell me about Katherine.
Talking about Katherine's not gonna help me.
Why not?
Because she's not the person I care about.
It flipped.
The switch. Why didn't you tell me?
Because I barely felt it at first,
but every night, it's gotten stronger.
It worked.
You worked.
You and Lexi?
Here on the bar?
On the bar, on the stage, on the roof.
It was a very long night.
Yeeh.
Where you going?
To the roof.
I want to hear the rest of the story.
Ok.
Excuse you.
I just want to see where we are.
You know, when we split up,
you did have the option of going with Stefan.
Yeah? And leave Bonnie's life your hands?
Fat chance.
Do you even know how to read a map?
Yes, and do you know who taught me?
My friend Magellan.
Wow! You had a friend.
Was he drawn to your darkness, too?
Actually, I was referring to Damon and Elena when I said that,
but clearly it struck a chord with you.
It's because it's not true!
There is no allure to darkness.
Really?
So you've never felt the attraction
that comes when someone who's capable of doing terrible things
for some reason cares only about you?
I did once when I thought he was worth it,
but it turns out some people can't be fixed.
People who do terrible things
are just terrible people.
We're here,
although judging by the lack of witches,
here is not the correct location.
Yield to the spirits, Bonnie!
You can't fight us!
Stop it. It's not what you think.
This is no place for a vampire.
She's working for Silas.
Silas?
He brainwashed her to kill you.
Wait. What are you doing?
If Silas has her, she's lost.
We can't save her.
Wait.
I have the power of 12 witches.
You don't stand a chance!
They're linked. Bonnie's gonna kill them.
Not if the witches kill her first.
Klaus, we need to save her.
How? The only way to stop the witches is to kill them,
and then Silas gets what he wants.
Spirits, take her soul.
Free her from darkness.
No!
Bonnie.
Bonnie!
The triangle is complete.
It's beautiful up here.
I could do this, you know?
The Lexi method.
Hang with you, party with you.
It wouldn't be the worst way to turn my emotions back on.
I thought you hated emotions.
I do.
Maybe I'm just looking for an excuse to...
spend more time with you.
I've never done it on a rooftop before.
You're not missing much.
You don't have to take the high road, Damon.
I'm not sired to you anymore.
I want this. You want this.
What?
Looking for that?
You really think that was gonna work,
the sex, the temptation, the booze?
What, are you kidding me?
I invented that trick.
Good luck!
Spent all night reinforcing it.
It was tough.
Had to be really quiet not to wake you up.
What is this?
Payment.
For what?
For the last 6 months of my life,
for the nagging,
for the self-righteous platitudes.
I'm paying you back for 6 months of you.
Your humanity isn't back on, is it?
Never was.
So this was all just--
A joke!
It was a big, fat lie.
Best part of it is, you believed it.
You thought I was a like Stefan,
a wounded little bird that you could nurse back to health,
but he's a victim.
I choose to be this way.
Enjoy the day.
I hear it's gonna be a scorcher.
So you pretended to have feelings for her
just to get her off your back?
I was willing to do whatever it took.
Sound familiar?
Aw. I hurt your feelings.
Not my feelings. I'm looking out for you.
Because one day, you will flip that switch back on,
and all the bad stuff that you did
is gonna come rushing back,
and it is going to suck.
So you're saying that you felt bad for Lexi?
She became a walking, talking reminder
of all the awful things I'd done.
I managed to avoid her for decades,
and then she just shows up in Mystic Falls
to wish my baby bro happy birthday, and boom--
rush of memories, rush of guilt.
So you killed her?
Out of sight, out of mind.
Every day that you're like this
is the day that you might do the one thing that you can't take back.
Here's what I don't get.
You spent 6 months trying to get her to fall in love with you
just so that you could hurt her.
You were spiteful, malicious, borderline evil,
and you say that you had your emotions turned off,
but those all sound like emotions to me.
Maybe they were.
Maybe hatred was the first one I got back.
All the more reason to cure you.
That way, we get the normal Elena back
without all the ugly stages in between.
I'm not taking the cure, Damon.
Yes, you are, even if I have to break your neck
or tie you up in chains until we find it.
What was that you said about handling things yourself?
How you feeling?
What are you doing here?
How'd I get here?
What do you mean? I--I brought you home.
The witches almost killed you.
What witches?
You don't remember?
Whatever the witches did must have messed with your memory.
How did I get off the island?
Wait. Bonnie...
What's the last thing you can remember?
I guess I remember being in that cave,
and
Jeremy was trying to pry the cure out of Silas' hands.
Please tell me he got it.
We didn't get it, did we?
Bonnie, there's something you need to know about Jeremy.
There. 12 graves for 12 witches.
Like it never happened.
Only it did happen,
and now silas has everything he needs
to open the gates to hell on earth.
You were just gonna let Bonnie die.
I know arithmetic isn't your strong point,
But one is still less than 12.
Yeah, but that one is my best friend.
You tell yourself whatever you need to
so you can sleep at night.
I just killed 12 people.
You look like you're in need of comfort.
Why don't you find someone less terrible you can relate to?
Thank you.
Of the 3 massacres, this is the one I was dreading.
Silas I presume.
Morning, Damon.
Where are you?
The better question would be where are we going?
Sorry, Damon. I think I broke your radio.
You're in my car?!
Heh. We weren't gonna take the bus.
I wish this could have gone differently.
I really do,
but we'll give Katherine your best.
Damon, what did you do?
Let's just say it involves a 5'7" Brunette
and her blond accomplice.
Please don't tell me this is going where I think it is.
Wrong fantasy, brother,
unless you're into betrayal and snapped necks.
The lead I had on Katherine Elena stole.
If you're searching for
the words to tell me how badly I screwed up,
save your breath.
I didn't stop the massacre.
Guess Silas has everything he needs.
Everything but the cure.
I'm sorry, mate.
Don't have it.
But you know who does,
and the last thing that you want
is for that cure to be used on you,
so you bring it to me,
and it won't be.
You get to live.
Yeah. With all of my dead supernatural enemies
from the other side.
You know, you don't scare me, Silas,
or, Shane, or, whoever you are.
I think I know what does.
Now where did you get that?
Well, let's just say your sister's mind
is a little easier to read than yours.
So...
Care to reconsider my offer?
I missed by an inch, but don't worry.
I'm not trying to kill you, not just yet.
Just a little something to remember me by.
