let &apos;s get down to business ,
provided i can be sure you &apos;re an ally .
an intriguing offer .
you &apos;ve got a deal .
what &apos;s going on ?
jack . i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m taking you home to l.a. , okay ?
my lawyer sent over our business contract .
why does this say that you plan to own 70 % of the company ?
any other investor would ask for much more .
maybe i should find out for myself .
i know someone who can help you .
who ?
my brother .
my father is grooming me
to take over the lemarchal empire .
we &apos;ll make a great team , daniel .
this table is the last thing my father and i worked on .
&quot; oscar chapman . &quot;
who is that ?
chapman worked for lemarchal media in &apos; 93 .
died in a car accident .
another dead end .
hey , nolan . what ?
oscar chapman faked his own death .
then we better pray we can find him .
and they &apos;re off !
victory can never be achieved alone .
allegiances must be forged to overcome superior forces --
some born from a shared goal ,
others out of desperate need .
but for a union to succeed ,
one must determine if an ally is truly a friend ...
... or merely an enemy in disguise .
you came .
i &apos;m surprised .
as was i when i received your invitation .
it &apos;s been a while since we last spoke .
i was beginning to think you lost interest in what i had to say .
i always want to hear the thoughts of beautiful women .
especially ones with secrets on the graysons .
conrad &apos;s landed some impressive blows against you .
i assume you want me to help clip his wings ?
you said you possess leverage on him ?
i &apos;ll pay a lot for it .
well , it &apos;s an attractive offer ,
considering my current financial state .
but surely you have other avenues you can pursue .
none with your access .
well , that &apos;s funny ,
seeing as your new partner was married to him for over 20 years .
which means you &apos;re playing me .
tell victoria , &quot; nice try . &quot;
hmm , what do you know , i won .
i &apos;m past security
and almost at the lemarchal records room .
i trust your meeting with pascal was fruitful .
as i suspected , victoria is using him to spy on me .
while you used him for our own purpose .
the plans were right .
the most secure rooms in the lemarchal building
are activated by pascal &apos;s print .
well , then , i &apos;ve got what you need .
发送
nolan &apos;s program just finished lifting it .
i &apos;m transmitting now .
i &apos;m in .
let &apos;s just hope there &apos;s something in here
that proves oscar chapman is alive .
javier !
wake up !
checking to see if i snuck out ?
i said i wouldn &apos;t .
no . i trust you .
but can we just talk about what happened the other day ?
come on , pal .
i think i &apos;ve earned five minutes .
okay .
we &apos;ll talk later .
that was a close one .
do you think he knows i &apos;m here ?
and what &apos;s he gonna do ?
ground me ?
well , he &apos;s obviously trying to guilt you into signing with him .
you still want me to go with your brother , don &apos;t you ?
look , i told you .
even if i am pissed at nolan , i can &apos;t do that .
it would crush him .
daniel can make things happen that nolan can &apos;t .
well , i sort of have my eye on a different grayson .
and she has hers on
a once @-@ in @-@ a @-@ lifetime opportunity for you .
hey , just talk to him .
and trust me .
if it &apos;s that important to you , okay .
set it up .
so , i &apos;m reeling this kid in ...
it &apos;s only a matter of time before i close him .
what exactly does this mystery program do
that is so valuable ?
well , charlotte got me a copy . here ,
see for yourself .
it &apos;s an aggregate of your digital footprint .
basically , it analyzes all your online habits ,
so it can direct anyone to your likes , needs , and desires .
what ?
i &apos;m not joking .
ask yourself something . test it .
uh , okay .
okay , margaux ,
what shoes do i want this season ?
jerome c. rousseau gold animal peep toe pumps .
oh , my god . she &apos;s right .
of course she is . she &apos;s you .
hey , that javier is a genius .
are you sure you want to bring this to my father ?
look . we want to work together , right ?
but your father &apos;s not gonna let me
as long as my last name &apos;s grayson .
unless , you bring him something like this .
and a deal like this
changes us from spectators ...
to owners .
well , hello , there , victoria .
emily , what an unpleasant surprise .
i highly doubt that , considering the little chat
that you arranged between me and your new paramour .
oh , i see that your imagination is as vivid as ever .
i would love to stay and chat ,
but i have less boring people to talk to .
what the hell are you doing here ?
you agreed to stay away .
relax . this isn &apos;t about you .
i &apos;m in town to receive the green american award
for my innovation in green technology .
i &apos;m surprised you didn &apos;t know .
you used to be so plugged in .
look at you , trying to prove
you &apos;re not the same pathetic lapdog
who followed conrad around the office .
what do you think these people would think
if they knew how the great luke gilliam acquired his wealth ?
you &apos;re really gonna bring that up ?
pull yourself together , victoria .
you were just as responsible for what happened .
don &apos;t pretend otherwise .
it was supposed to be you , not david .
well , unlike him , i didn &apos;t let conrad stab me in the back .
he tried to frame me the second he got in over his head ,
but i was happy he did it ,
because at that moment , i learned the greatest lesson of all --
screw the other guy .
careful , luke ,
or your return to the hamptons just might be your downfall .
i &apos;d hate to meet that threat ,
with the evidence i &apos;ve been holding onto all these years .
use it !
nothing would make me happier
than to see you and conrad take each other down .
you need to learn to let the past go .
after all , we got away with it , scot @-@ free .
his name is luke gilliam .
he was grayson global &apos;s biggest earner .
rumor was he illegally manipulated energy markets ,
which conrad used to inflate profits .
that made him the logical choice
to take the fall for laundering terrorist money .
i mean , he was certainly an easier sell than your father .
when that plan failed , the graysons had no choice .
but i don &apos;t understand how you missed gilliam before .
my father never wrote about him in his journals .
he quit before the company was tied to the bombing .
so , he just took his cut and ran ?
he used his payout to start a natural gas company .
he &apos;s in town to accept an award for his ...
environmentally safe techniques .
you have your doubts .
it &apos;s more than that .
he has evidence about fight 197,
and i &apos;m going to get it from him .
what about you ?
did you find anything in oscar chapman &apos;s personnel file ?
no , no . nothing -- well , nothing concrete .
he grew up in new york ,
was transferred to london around the time of the bombing .
if mason was right and oscar faked his own death ,
then he may have returned home to hide .
i wish i could help you .
you stay focused .
get that evidence .
you &apos;re gonna need this later .
we want bigger . we have to wow him .
and masculine colors -- red , orange , blue .
nothing too soft .
oh , i got nothing for you .
jack ! you &apos;re back !
yeah . i flew in this morning .
thanks .
it &apos;s pretty crazy around here .
yeah . i &apos;m just about to close a very big deal with daniel .
did you have a good time in l.a. ?
well , it wasn &apos;t really that kind of trip .
my mom was dealing with some pretty heavy stuff .
oh , sure .
no , i &apos;m sorry .
margaux , can you look at this ?
excuse us . excuse us .
margaux ...
i get that what you &apos;re working on is really important .
but ...
i was gone for over a week , and we didn &apos;t talk once .
what &apos;s going on ?
my father asked me to take over his business .
not just &quot; voulez &quot; -- all of it .
well , we clearly have a lot of stuff to catch up on .
we need to make time for each other , margaux .
how about tonight ? hmm ?
i get a sitter , we turn off our phones ,
and we try to get back on the same page .
uh , yes .
yes . but tonight is impossible .
i promise , once the deal is done ,
i &apos;m all yours .
your hydrangeas are dead .
time was you cared for them
like they were gifts from chloris herself .
and you &apos;ve never shown any interest in botany .
so what do you really want , conrad ?
well , hamptons gossip is buzzing
about your confrontation with luke gilliam .
we &apos;re divorced ,
and you forfeited any right to question my actions .
oh , you &apos;re right .
i &apos;m merely here to protect my interests .
i paid luke handsomely for his silence .
and i &apos;d hate for you to
derail that armistice with your irrational behavior .
i couldn &apos;t be happier to leave all that behind
now that i have true happiness on the horizon .
with pascal ?
i regret to inform you that your latest romantic facade
isn &apos;t built on a foundation of honesty and trust .
why don &apos;t you ask him about his role in the conspiracy
that doomed your beloved david clarke .
going somewhere ?
my parole officer called .
probably wants to know
why i haven &apos;t found gainful employment .
maybe you could come with , huh ? explain why ?
why don &apos;t we just clear the air ?
we couldn &apos;t make a deal . it &apos;s fine .
you got to where you are by looking out for your own interests .
no , i got to where i am because someone believed in me .
oh , you mean david clarke , the terrorist .
you know what , despite what the rest of the world thinks ,
he was a great man .
do you know something that i don &apos;t ?
yeah , smartass , i do .
he saw in me what i see in you ...
angry hacker ,
chip on his shoulder .
you have got the brilliance ,
but you also have the potential to go down the wrong path .
you mean like letting a terrorist bankroll you ?
that &apos;s what they called me when we first met .
i got to go . just ...
... think about what i said .
yeah . i will .
nolan &apos;s got a lead on chapman . i &apos;m off to the city to meet him now .
how long will you be ?
why ?
do you need help on your end ?
nah , don &apos;t worry .
i &apos;ll figure something out .
i hope you find what you &apos;re looking for .
okay . bye .
hey , you &apos;re back .
yeah .
is this a bad time ?
no . not at all . come on in .
how &apos;s stevie ?
the graysons really hurt her .
jack , i &apos;m so sorry .
i know .
i guess that &apos;s why i came .
i needed to see someone who gets it .
so , this is your new target ?
yes .
luke gilliam .
he runs a clean gas company , but it &apos;s a sham .
the chemicals he uses are toxic .
they get into the water , poison the ground .
and let me guess ...
his wells don &apos;t end up in towns like the hamptons .
and these people don &apos;t have the means to fight back .
this guy has been untouchable .
he has evidence of conrad &apos;s role in the bombing .
i &apos;m meeting with him tomorrow .
so , getting to this guy
will help you take down the graysons ?
yeah .
you know , maybe there &apos;s something that you could do to help .
really ?
look , you know i don &apos;t like you involved in any of this ...
but i am ,
especially after what happened to my mom .
i &apos;m all in .
let &apos;s do this .
why exactly am i waiting here ?
you can &apos;t have a stakeout without takeout .
do you have a lead on oscar chapman or not ?
what ? chapman lives there ?
no . but a woman named brenda evans does .
she emptied out oscar chapman &apos;s bank account
with a bunch of fake i.d.s 20 years ago .
so , either this woman stole from chapman ,
or she &apos;s working with him .
exactly .
which makes her
our best bet at finding him .
why the aiden face ? this is good news .
i thought things were better after your trip home .
well , with my mother , yes , but , then again ,
she didn &apos;t plant a bomb on a plane
that killed over 200 people , now , did she , nolan ?
aiden , we don &apos;t know the whole truth .
i mean , he tried to talk to a reporter , right ?
what , to sell his story , rewrite history ?
i mean , which one of those
is meant to make me feel better , eh , nolan ?
he wasn &apos;t david clarke . he was a coward .
hello ?
is something wrong ?
i spoke with conrad .
is it true ?
did you profit off of david &apos;s death ?
i don &apos;t have to explain myself .
i don &apos;t want to , and i don &apos;t have to .
you damn well better explain yourself now .
i need to know the truth .
i carried this guilt for 20 years
and every time i looked at conrad ,
i was forced to remember the choice i had to make .
and now he tells me that you &apos;re part of it .
i can &apos;t live like this .
stop it .
will you stop ? !
stop it !
damn you !
conrad wants this .
don &apos;t give him that power .
he &apos;s trying to drive us apart . don &apos;t you see ?
i was brought as an investor .
i had nothing to do with it .
a reporter wanted to reveal the story about david .
that would have badly exposed conrad .
and i knew if conrad went down , he &apos;d take you with him .
so , i silenced the story .
because i love you .
i always loved you .
conrad will keep coming at us ...
unless we stop him .
i know .
there is something i could do ,
but it &apos;s not without risk .
to be honest , miss thorne ,
i &apos;m surprised you &apos;re looking for a job .
but my divorce left me struggling .
you were screwed by the graysons .
trust me , i know how they operate .
that &apos;s right . you worked for conrad .
well , i would love to be a part of what you &apos;re doing now .
i have served on many boards in the green sector ,
and maybe i could help smooth over some of the problems
you &apos;re having with environmentalists .
they &apos;re eco @-@ terrorists .
oh , no , i &apos;ve spent a fortune defending myself .
believe me , i &apos;m the victim here .
you &apos;re full of crap .
i got family that lives near one of your wells .
the ground is poisoned . people can &apos;t drink the water .
this is what i &apos;m talking about .
how do you live with yourself ?
i carry these around to show people like you .
this is the compound my company uses
to extract gas from the ground .
and this is how dangerous it is .
so , i think what we &apos;ve learned here
is that you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
you &apos;ve got an answer for everything , don &apos;t you ?
excuse me , but you &apos;re wrong .
mr. gilliam has won every single case ever brought against him .
that &apos;s 30 trials in 12 states ,
so maybe you should dig a little deeper
than liberal propaganda before you attack someone &apos;s character .
i &apos;m sorry for jumping in .
but ... i &apos;m a big proponent of doing your research .
and i &apos;m impressed .
i &apos;d like you to come to the awards tomorrow .
the locals seem restless ,
and i could use someone like you in my corner .
well , there &apos;s nowhere i &apos;d rather be .
we &apos;re so pleased you could come .
and without your monitor .
yeah , i &apos;m a little confused .
i was supposed to be on house arrest
for another six months .
yeah , yeah , i called in a few favors
and got the terms of your parole changed .
what did i tell you about my brother ?
listen , havier , it &apos;s no secret
why we wanted you to come in today .
you represent a new frontier in media technology .
and we have the resources to launch
both you and your product at the same time .
javier , we can make you a star .
this can change your life , javier .
this is amazing .
i &apos;m blown away , guys .
seriously . i just --
i know . you made a promise to nolan .
yes .
and your loyalty is honorable .
but this is a business decision ,
and you must consider all your options .
why don &apos;t you think about it on your test drive ?
this is a key to a mclaren .
how did you know that &apos;s my favorite car ?
i asked your program .
oh , of course you did .
why don &apos;t you go see what she can do , huh ? yeah .
hell , yeah !
thank you .
thank you .
have fun .
brenda evans ?
yes ?
we &apos;d like to ask you a few questions
about oscar chapman .
my god , you &apos;re oscar chapman .
i @-@ i didn &apos;t realize who you both were .
i thought you were here to kill me .
i @-@ i &apos;m very sorry , mr. ross .
it &apos;s no problem .
i always found the use of both arms redundant .
how did you find me ?
we have our ways ...
brenda ?
i &apos;m only her when i leave home .
the people i &apos;m hiding from have never stopped looking for me .
so , i guess it &apos;s no surprise
that trevor mathis &apos; son didn &apos;t stop , either .
how do you know my father ?
i &apos;d just moved to london ,
and he came to me with the story of a lifetime .
why you and not the police ?
well , he didn &apos;t know who he could trust .
he had already been lied to once
when they told him that they &apos;d ...
they &apos;d free your sister if he planted that bomb .
but i don &apos;t understand . why would he let all those people die ?
your father had no idea what he planted on that plane .
they told him it was diamonds .
when we met , he carried so much shame .
having to hide that from you and your mother consumed him .
he was desperate to make things right .
then why kill himself ?
i &apos;m sorry .
your father was murdered .
he had every intention of facing what he did .
but mr. lemarchal had other ideas .
yeah , the second i gave pascal that @-@ that story ,
i knew i &apos;d made a mistake .
and , so , i @-@ i called your dad ,
and i told him to collect everything he could
and to meet me , but he never showed .
and when i heard about that suicide ,
i knew pascal had staged that whole thing .
he killed your father .
we need you to come forward , mr. chapman .
we can help you get your life back .
your real life .
but only if you stop hiding .
please ...
help me finish my father &apos;s fight .
i &apos;ll do whatever you need .
this room is , uh ...
it &apos;s bigger than the apartment building that i grew up in .
oh , not there !
that would be like breaking 50 mirrors .
i do not care .
i feel invincible with you by my side .
does that mean you &apos;ll sign ?
i can &apos;t betray nolan .
we &apos;re more than just friends .
we ...
we &apos;re brothers .
you only knew him behind bars .
but out here , he &apos;ll do whatever it takes to win .
that &apos;s why he stuck you with that crappy deal .
look , i &apos;m sure he &apos;s gonna change it .
he wants to take your ideas and shove you in the background .
you can either be next to nolan ross ,
or you can be the next nolan ross .
chapman &apos;s agreed to help us .
that &apos;s great .
well , we &apos;ve made some good progress , too .
so take your time .
and , aiden ...
i &apos;m happy for you .
so , he &apos;s , uh , back in the picture ?
well , it &apos;s complicated .
say no more .
i know all about complicated .
so , i &apos;m assuming this isn &apos;t what gilliam uses in his mines .
it &apos;s a mixture of saline and gelatin .
so he &apos;s lying to everyone .
well , you can use that , right ?
what &apos;s on here ?
his undoing .
i had a feeling you &apos;d be stopping by .
if memory serves ,
armagnac is your elixir of choice for a broken heart .
you know , i wish i could say that i was sorry ,
but we both know few sounds are sweeter
than the crumbling of your fellow man .
i have everything handled .
there won &apos;t be any fallout .
just stay calm , and it &apos;ll all be fine .
do you recall our chats from 1993 ?
so , that &apos;s what you have on me .
you recorded our conversations .
about the bomb , david ...
every word .
you &apos;re on those tapes , too .
but i control what the world hears ...
which means ...
i control you .
you okay ?
yeah .
yeah , i think i am .
&apos;cause , uh ...
i know a little bit about unresolved father issues
and , uh , how it feels to get past them .
how about a hug , big guy ?
or not .
i assume your diligence with that new deal
has something to do with the boy charlotte brought home .
i have to say , daniel , i don &apos;t like you using your sister .
oh , i &apos;m not . she does what she wants .
and i actually think she likes him .
he &apos;s a felon .
then he should fit right in .
i noticed these lying around .
isn &apos;t this the guy you had the dust @-@ up with at the track ?
what &apos;s his story ?
luke gilliam used to work with your father .
was he involved with the , uh ... ?
i have a major deal about to close .
tell me nothing is about to blow back on this family .
oh , luke won &apos;t be a problem .
how can you be so sure ?
because i brought him here .
that fight was just for show .
who do you think nominated him
for that absurd award he &apos;s receiving ?
what are you up to ?
i &apos;m merely testing a theory .
oh , so , this is about emily ?
and your maneuver to steal nolan &apos;s protoce ? isn &apos;t ?
happy hunting .
awards are a platform to help us spread our message .
excuse me .
emily , glad you could make it .
oh , i wouldn &apos;t miss it .
listen , i &apos;ve been getting a lot of tweets from our local nature nuts .
can you run interference in case things take a turn ?
absolutely .
just stick to your presentation . that &apos;ll shut them up .
oh , nothing ever stops people with an agenda .
victoria ?
i don &apos;t believe it .
once cameras arrive ,
of course you put aside your righteous indignation .
hypocrisy is alive and well and living in the hamptons .
well , we &apos;ve finally hit upon a subject on which you &apos;re an expert .
oh , you &apos;re not on the guest list , vicki ,
but i &apos;m sure we can drum up something for you ... in the back .
i wasn &apos;t expecting to see you here , victoria .
well , i can only hope it comes as a terrible disappointment to you .
looky . looky .
this came from my lawyers .
and i think ...
you will be happy with the changes .
but i wanted to fix the bugs in the source code ,
and i can &apos;t find it in the cloud . did you move it ?
where &apos;s your monitor ?
my parole officer took it off .
daniel grayson called in a favor .
that &apos;s why my clone is not on the server .
i didn &apos;t think it would be right for you to keep working on it .
javier , listen to me .
this program -- it &apos;s not ready .
you -- you &apos;re not ready .
you cannot go into business with these people .
and it is not even up for debate !
it never is with you , is it ? !
it &apos;s always gonna be what nolan ross wants .
daniel and margaux -- they are looking out for me .
you will regret this .
no one plays me .
oh , but you &apos;ve already been played .
before i take my leave ,
i &apos;d like to address the activists out there
who question my integrity .
i want them to know i run the cleanest , safest ,
greenest company on the planet ,
not because it &apos;s good business ,
but because i truly love our beautiful mother we call earth .
and if i can put these chemicals in her ,
you can be damn sure
they &apos;re safe enough to put in me .
oh , no .
mr. gilliam , are you all right ?
i need a doctor now .
i thought you said the formula was safe .
it &apos;s not , you idiot !
mr. lemarchal , i beg of you --
do you know what your problem always was ?
you were too good a reporter .
environmental activists
welcome the revelations caught on camera
that confirm the rumors that have hounded luke gilliam for years .
the once celebrated gilliam natural gas company --
luke gilliam ...
we have unfinished business .
what the ... ?
you did this to me .
i could have died !
the drug i used was harmless .
i need you alive .
what do you want with me ?
the leverage that you have on conrad grayson .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
look at where you are .
do you really want to lie to me ?
why would i give that up to you ?
because if you don &apos;t ,
i will make every day of your life hell .
i will make you pay for all of the people that you &apos;ve hurt --
both now and in the past .
and that &apos;s not a threat .
it &apos;s a promise .
i &apos;ll give you what you want .
but , please , leave me alone .
margaux ?
nolan called me .
yeah .
well , i guess he must be upset .
so , you did screw him over .
no . daniel and i made a better offer .
it wasn &apos;t about money for nolan .
he wanted to help that kid , but daniel
wants to use him like he uses everyone
including you .
are we really doing this again ?
i know that you think daniel is your friend ,
but trust me , he &apos;s not .
he gets off on doing this to us , and i wish you could see that .
i &apos;ve worked all my life to get here ,
and it &apos;s finally happening .
i wish you could see that .
i can &apos;t ,
not when my friends end up your collateral damage .
jack ...
jack , don &apos;t leave like this .
please .
i love you , margaux , but right now , i can &apos;t be around you .
so , i , uh , i got you something .
a bentley ?
think of it as a finder &apos;s fee for delivering javier .
no , i didn &apos;t do this for a car .
i just want what &apos;s best for javier .
okay , well , give it back , then .
no way !
i &apos;m sorry .
did i interrupt ?
are you out of your mind ?
no .
but you must be for pissing off a genius .
wow . i knew you were a loser .
i didn &apos;t know you were a sore one .
ah , you may have infected margaux and this one ,
but i won &apos;t let you do the same to javier .
i just want you to understand --
this is ...
war .
mr. mathis ?
surprised ?
surely you must know i keep track of all the pieces on the board .
what do you want ?
that &apos;s not the right question .
it &apos;s what you want --
pascal lemarchal .
i assume your return on the heels of his arrival
was no coincidence .
you &apos;ve learned the truth about him .
well , why don &apos;t you tell me ?
you seem enlightened on these things .
while you , on the other hand , are fumbling through the dark .
i &apos;m afraid pascal has already paid a visit to mr. chapman .
he &apos;s cleaning house ,
and you &apos;re next unless i run interference for you .
and why would you do that ?
well , because he has something i want ,
and i believe you can get it .
go to hell .
you will find that it &apos;s better to make an ally of me
than an enemy , mr. mathis .
is this guy going to be a problem ?
no , in the end , he &apos;ll do what i want , mr. marino ...
just as pascal did ,
once we alerted him to the whereabouts of mr. chapman .
luke gilliam had the money transfers from the terrorists .
it proves that conrad was the original contact .
