mugger pistol @-@ whipped and kicked him .
manager says the father &apos;s a regular , always carries cash .

and you stomp .
i do not stomp .
the son regained consciousness at the hospital .
oh , great . let &apos;s go .
the guy came out of nowhere .
he slammed his gun into my face , and ...
i blacked out .
it took 22 stitches to close the gash in his head .
he has a concussion .
he broke his ribs and his fingers .
my father @-@ in @-@ law ...
do you remember anything about your attacker ?
race ? height ? regional accent , a tattoo , anything ?
no . it happened so fast . i ...
i didn &apos;t even see him .
by the time i came to , my dad was dead .
the paramedics were talking to me .
we &apos;re very sorry for your loss .
if you remember anything else , please give us a call , okay ?
thank you .
are you going to get the guy who killed my grandpa ?
we &apos;re gonna do everything we can .
no . no . i &apos;m not ready yet .
it &apos;s beautiful .
i bought it for you at a street market in the sahel .
you did not .
yes , i did .
why don &apos;t you ever tell me when you &apos;re coming ?
because i never know if i am .
oh . that &apos;s jane &apos;s mother .
should i hide ?
uh , no .
uh , just say that we &apos;re colleagues .
i don &apos;t want to have to explain you .
i &apos;m hard to explain .
good morning .
oh . i &apos;m so sorry . i didn &apos;t know that --
uh , no , no , no . it &apos;s -- it &apos;s okay .
um , dr. faulkner , uh , was just --
um , he came by for some tea .
please call me ian .
oh . we &apos;re just making some black tea .
would you like some ?
uh , thank you .
you &apos;re working early , dr. isles .
we were just , um , conferring on a case .
oh , really ? what case is that ?
oh , you know , angela , uh , is in the middle of , um ,
getting certified to become a professional organizer .
isn &apos;t that great ?
that &apos;s very impressive .
well , there &apos;s no advancement in my field
without continuing education .
uh @-@ huh , what &apos;s your field ?
i run the police cafe ? .
it &apos;s disorganized ?
yes . it &apos;s , um , the pantry is a disaster .
well , we can &apos;t have that .
no .
um , i &apos;m gonna be certified soon ,
so if &quot; you &apos;re a disorganized , busy professional ... &quot;
you mean , um , like dr. isles , here ?
yes ! shall we start ?
&quot; are you ready to conquer the clutter ? &quot;
yeah , well , um , i &apos;m just gonna check &quot; yes . &quot;
look -- stop . i don &apos;t care what you have to say .
nah ! nah ! i told them . i &apos;m the one that called it in !
tell her . i called it in .
he said he was with a &quot; detective vanilla . &quot;
can &apos;t imagine why you didn &apos;t just take his word for it .
it &apos;s all right . he &apos;s with us .
he got to be here ?
he does .
talk .
well , i &apos;ve been keeping my ear to the street ,
like you told me to ,
and i hear about a junkie named viper
with a bunch of cash .
that must be viper .
that was viper .
what do you know about him ?
dope fiend .
okay , wait right here .
hmm . .38 special .
same caliber as the shooting .
blood on the barrel .
probably from pistol @-@ whipping chris dunbar .
i &apos;ll take that bet .
he mugs father and son , uses the cash to buy dope ,
and then o.d. &apos; s at a public picnic table .
what are you thinking ?
i &apos;m thinking that &apos;s odd , aren &apos;t you ?
yeah .
junkies don &apos;t shoot dope out in the open .
they &apos;re like cockroaches . they hide .
something &apos;s off .
ah , we &apos;re feeling better .
your shoes match .
i was just tired last night .
you &apos;re still limping .
who &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s not important .
uh , okay . well , can we go out on a limb
and say that this junkie o.d. &apos; d ?
yes .
really ?
he overdosed on heroin .
this is from his syringe .
it tested at almost 80 % purity .
80 % ? that &apos;s the good stuff .
pure , non @-@ cut --
how does a street junkie get his hands on that ?
i got the print report here .
oh , can i see that ?
crime lab says junkie &apos;s syringe had no fingerprints on it .
died before he had a chance to wipe them off .
yeah , so someone wiped them off for him .
well , you didn &apos;t even read it that time .
it &apos;s nothing .
you &apos;re in a weird mood .
no . i &apos;m not .
okay .
all right . i got to go talk to my c.i.
you want to grab a coffee afterwards ?
no . i already had tea .
oh .
did you meet dr. isles &apos; new hunk ?
what ?
ian .
they think i was born yesterday .
he spent the night .
okay , ma , that &apos;s really none of your bus--
ian spent the night ?
didn &apos;t she tell you ?
yeah .
yes .
okay , thanks .
don &apos;t they have cappuccinos ?
no .
now tell me about viper .
where &apos;d he get pure dope ?
mm . tastes better with foamed milk .
crap . buy yourself some foam .
now -- pure dope .
oh , word is it hit the street six months ago .
real good sh-- stuff .
and where &apos;s it coming from ?
nobody knows .
all right , um ...
you call me if you hear anything , all right ?
i got you on speed dial , vanilla .
okay .
ballistics confirmed the gun we found on the dead junkie
was the murder weapon used to kill evan dunbar
and beat up his son , chris .
well , what about gunshot residue ?
did it confirm that the junkie was the shooter ?
no . the opposite . very little gsr on the dead junkie .
so the gun was planted .
seems like it .
well , maybe we &apos;re not looking at a random mugging .
maybe we &apos;re looking at a hit .
what do we know about the victim &apos;s business ?
bostonia shipping logistics -- our victim handled
freight and customs brokering for small businesses .
his son , chris , worked for him .
is the company clean ?
very . checked i.c.e. ,
d.e.a. , drug control unit .
nothing . not a whiff of anything sketchy .
you said the son , chris , worked for the dad ?
you think he had someone beat his face to a pulp ?
i don &apos;t know . i mean , father owns the business .
if he dies , the son inherits it .
so , a few blows to the face .
dad &apos;s a widower , chris is an only child .
there &apos;s another relative . victim had a brother , arthur .
well , that &apos;s a prison mug shot . what &apos;s he in for ?
mandatory 10 years for dealing cocaine .
oh , wait . look at this .
company &apos;s clean , but the victim wasn &apos;t .
he was indicted with his brother .
yeah , but look . evan didn &apos;t do time .
because the d.a. gave him immunity
for testifying against his brother , arthur .
damn . our victim put his own brother away .
when does arthur get out ?
six weeks ago .
probably pretty pissed off after 10 years in the slammer .
that &apos;s a good motive for murder . let &apos;s bring him in .
won &apos;t be easy . guy &apos;s off the grid .
no driver &apos;s license , no bank accounts . not seeing anything .
get creative . we got to find him .
it &apos;s maura . she got something on the vic .
evan dunbar had an odd residue
on his shoe bottoms and pant cuffs -- cyanoacrylate powder ,
used almost exclusively in nail salons .
so our shooting victim visited a nail salon
before he was killed .
it appears so , although his nails didn &apos;t look like
they &apos;ve ever been touched by an emery board .
is that ian ?
uh , let &apos;s go and take a look at the victim &apos;s nails .
oh , let &apos;s .
yes , it was ian . he &apos;s just an old friend .
hm . his cuticles have never been cut .
i &apos;d say he &apos;s never had a manicure .
you don &apos;t have to tell me about ian .
it &apos;s none of my business .
i &apos;m not not telling you about him .
he just stopped by this morning .
i heard he stopped by last night .
uh he lives in africa .
it &apos;s , um ...
it &apos;s complicated .
uh , let me know if you find anything else
in the case , you know , that &apos;s not complicated .
i mean , who am i to help you with your complicated love life ?
jane .
goodbye .
have a fabulous time reading your love texts in private .
no , jane . jane , wait . wait . it &apos;s nothing .
it &apos;s nothing . look .
he just said , &quot; guess what we &apos;d be doing
if we were in ethiopia right now . &quot;
that doesn &apos;t sound complicated .
i killed korsak with your scalpel .
i contaminated all your dna samples .
i snuck into your closet ,
and i put all your shoes in different boxes .
what ? !
never mind .
what ? no . jane . jane , wait . wait , wait . i &apos;m sorry .
let me at least take a look at your foot .
oh , no . i don &apos;t think we &apos;re close enough for that anymore .
please ? i &apos;m -- i &apos;m sorry . okay ?
look , i &apos;m ...
you &apos;ll really sorry when my toe kills me .
don &apos;t touch it .
maura .
okay , you have acute onychocryptosis .
do i need to update my will ?
ingrown toenail . you need a minor procedure .
okay , you do it .
me ? i don &apos;t do surgery .
it &apos;s not a kidney transplant , maura . just do it !
not gonna ask .
what ... is it ?
chris dunbar is checking out of the hospital .
how ? he was in critical condition yesterday .
can you believe the insurance company is kicking him out ?
yeah . they said if i can get myself to the bathroom ,
then i don &apos;t need a hospital .
any news on the case ?
we &apos;re working some leads .
your father ever go to a nail salon ?
my father ? no . no , he wasn &apos;t that kind of guy . why ?
come on , aidan .
let &apos;s go outside . we &apos;ll meet daddy out front .
did your father and you ever have any personal difficulties ?
no . no , we always got along .
what about business disagreements ?
why would you be asking me this ? we were mugged .
it &apos;s possible it wasn &apos;t random .
can you think of anyone
that might have wanted to hurt your father ?
no . no one .
how about your uncle arthur ? have you seen him recently ?
no . i haven &apos;t --
i haven &apos;t seen my uncle since he went to prison .
and did he ever threaten your father ?
i mean , they had their issues , but no .
i mean , i -- i don &apos;t believe
arthur would kill his brother or hurt me .
there &apos;s ... just no way .
thank you .
take good care of yourself . we &apos;ll be in touch . thanks .
pretty crummy insurance , just throwing him out in that condition .
well , he has minimal coverage , but he &apos;s covered till tomorrow .
why &apos;d his doctors release him , then ?
they didn &apos;t . he &apos;s leaving a.m.a.
against medical advice .
so why &apos;d he lie ?
yeah , and why is he in such a hurry to get out ?
thank you .
i had a mani @-@ pedi once .
so you &apos;re that kind of guy .
had to get close to a drug dealer
who did business over pedicures -- got a fungus !
did you at least make the arrest ?
he got four years . i got yellow toes .
here he comes .
what &apos;s he doing ?
i don &apos;t know .
bye , dad !
he &apos;s in a hurry to go somewhere .
he &apos;s pulling a container out of customs &apos; holding .
must be pretty important .
look at the guy . he &apos;s having trouble walking .
yeah . something smells .
we got to get a look in that container .
hey , frost .
i need you to get me a search warrant .
what &apos;s going on ?
we were gonna ask you the same thing .
we need to take a look inside the container .
jane !
i got the manifest -- ugh !
rats ! there &apos;s rats in there .
&quot; ooh , eek ! a rat ! help ! help ! help ! &quot;
stop .
what &apos;s the shipment ?
deliveries from china
for four different boston customers .
you got a toy store , jewelry store ,
furniture store , and ...
&quot; lee &apos;s nail spa . &quot;
wow . that &apos;s something since
our victim was in a nail salon
before he was killed .
stay away from nail salons .
stop talking about your nasty toes .
at least i &apos;m not afraid of rodents .
anything ?
nothing . no drugs .
damn it .
we got to find time to go through all the boxes .
i think the clock ran out .
we can &apos;t seize the container
without probable cause .
then we got to find something fast .
you said that your father had never been in a nail salon .
yeah , he hasn &apos;t .
all right , well , one of your clients
owns a nail salon .
you &apos;re delivering a shipment to &quot; lee &apos;s nail spa . &quot;
yeah , i don &apos;t know all of our clients .
all right , but i did just speak to my attorney .
now , unless you found any drugs , which you won &apos;t ,
you need to release this container back to me .
port agent says you &apos;ve never
signed for a container before .
this one must be special .
this business feeds my family ,
and now it &apos;s all i have left of my father .
so , yeah , i &apos;m gonna take care of our clients .
jane ?
yeah .
i got a whole shipment of these .
good , &apos; cause he &apos;s hiding something .
nice save , frost .
these studded bracelets
are illegal in massachusetts .
so they &apos;re for a shop in new hampshire .
punk rock accessory in new hampshire ,
dangerous weapon in massachusetts .
i &apos;m so sorry . we &apos;re gonna have to impound this entire container .
you gonna hear from my attorney .
call csru . we take everything .
what are you doing here ?
my toe . it &apos;s killing me .
unless it &apos;s given you a staph infection ,
it &apos;s hardly killing you .
what ? d-- oh !
i &apos;m ... so sorry to barge in .
no , it &apos;s okay .
hey , you must be jane rizzoli .
let me get you a glass of wine .
okay . thank you . uh , you must be ian .
jane needs a phenolisation procedure .
ooh , then you &apos;re gonna want a lot of wine .
i &apos;d better open another bottle .
did you come over here to check up on me ?
oh , yeah , i rubbed bad germs all over my ingrown toenail
so i could spy on you .
um , maura , i can &apos;t find the corkscrew .
your mother has been doing some organizing for me .
oh , god , can &apos;t she find a slob to ...
... bother ?
i &apos;m so sorry .
it &apos;s okay .
she alphabetized everything .
so now corkscrew is next to the chopsticks .
hey , um , let me , uh , see that foot while i open the wine .
okay .
what can i use to do the procedure ?
huh ? oh , i @-@ i -- i thought maura was gonna do it .
uh , ian is much more qualified .
i just got a new pair of carbon steel pruning sheers .
but would that be under &quot; c &quot;
or &quot; s &quot; ?
uh , &quot; p &quot; ?
i guess that makes sense .
&quot; p &quot; for &quot; pruning . &quot;
cute .
what , are you gonna cut off my toe ?
it &apos;s pretty much the same tool the podiatrists use .
okay , so i &apos;m gonna need some betadine
and a topical anesthetic spray .
well , you &apos;ve got your own traveling pharmacy over there .
uh , ian is taking some supplies back to africa .
oh .
this is gonna feel a little bit cold .
oh @-@ kay . no , that &apos;s fine .
oh , i &apos;ll need , uh , a toothpick , too .
what -- what -- what for ?
now hold still &apos; cause this might pinch a little bit .
you really got a grip on it , don &apos;t you , doc ?
when do i take the toothpick out ?
a day .
it &apos;s keeping the nail away from the wound .
it might smart a little .
no , what , really ?
because you dug into my toe with pruning sheers ?
the periungual &apos;s sensitive .
are you sure you don &apos;t want to stay for dinner ?
um , no , no , i &apos;ve lost my appetite .
you two kids have fun .
thanks , ma .
oh , hey . you &apos;re looking for dr . maura isles .
give it to me . i &apos;ll take it to her .
ma !
what ? it &apos;s from ian .
wow . two @-@ buck chuck and three rolls of toilet paper .
romance lives .
she &apos;s more secretive about this one , isn &apos;t she ?
no .
yes .
hurts your feelings
that she &apos;s not confiding in you .
i &apos;m sorry , sweetheart .
i don &apos;t care .
you know , i -- i don &apos;t need to know every detail of her personal life .
it &apos;s all right .
but she usually tells you .
yeah .
he seems charming .
but , you know , those are the ones you have to worry about .
i got a really weird vibe from him .
he was unpacking boxes .
and then when he saw me , he just closed &apos; em all up .
it was like ...
that &apos;s your cop gut .
maybe he &apos;s a criminal .
i don &apos;t know .
well , he is australian .
uh , aren &apos;t they all descended from crooks ?
ma , that was like 200 years ago ,
and i don &apos;t think we can hold that against him .
you know , while i &apos;m in there organizing ,
i could poke around .
please don &apos;t do that .
i hear you loud and clear . you need deniability .
ma , no .
no ! wh--
ma-- maura !
maura !
that must be from ian .
this ian really knows how to woo a girl .
when we did relief work together in ethiopia ,
we &apos;d talk about what we &apos;d give
for some cheap wine and toilet paper .
how come you never told me about him ?
i &apos;m sure i have . you must &apos;ve forgotten .
thanks for this .
what &apos;s up ?
chris dunbar &apos;s not happy we impounded his shipment .
he &apos;s threatening legal action if we don &apos;t release it .
any luck finding uncle arthur ?
nothing from social security .
no phone , not any paying utilities .
well , what about a -- a -- a discount card ,
a pharmacy , a sweepstakes entry ?
everybody signs up for something .
i &apos;ll keep digging .
so we &apos;re back to that one lead -- nails .
well , we know our victim was in a nail salon before he died .
and we know he shipped supplies for lee &apos;s nail spa .
let &apos;s go talk to &quot; lee . &quot;
yes , that &apos;s mr. dunbar .
we wondered what happened to our supplies .
and you two are business partners ?
how long have you been using his shipping service ?
a few years . good prices , reliable .
he was a nice man .
your supplies come from china ?
yes , uh , you &apos;d be amazed what the profit margin is on hand oils and candles .
i bet .
excuse me . mani @-@ pedi today ?
handy we both have toe problems .
we &apos;re in a nail salon .
how about a complimentary service ?
no , sorry . we &apos;re not allowed to accept gifts .
and plus my friend here had a bad experience .
fungus .
ah , gives the industry a bad name .
i &apos;ve tried everything --
mouthwash , vapor rub , hemorrhoid cream .
r-- hemorrhoid cream ?
i &apos;d do anything to get rid of it .
so you can wear your strappy sandals ?
use this , three times a day .
112 bucks ? !
small price to pay .
rizzoli .
never doubt the power of greed .
i never do . did you find uncle arthur ?
you were right .
he filled out a publisher &apos;s clearing house entry .
gave them his work address .
evan &apos;s dead ? what happened ?
where were you two nights ago around 9 : 00 p.m. ?
i was working here . my shift ends at 11 : 00 .
what happened to my brother ?
we were hoping you may have had a thought .
no , we really haven &apos;t been in touch .
since he testified against you .
i don &apos;t harbor hard feelings .
but you didn &apos;t reach out to him after 10 years in prison .
i was going to .
i just needed to get my feet on the ground .
you know ... evan was the responsible one .
he took over the business when dad died .
he worked hard . he found a way to make a little profit .
but not a big enough profit .
is that when the two of you started dealing coke ?
evan had nothing to do with that .
but he testified against you .
seems like that might have made you angry .
he had no choice , okay ? i told him to .
what about your nephew ?
when &apos;s the last time you saw chris ?
i &apos;m a convicted drug dealer .
i figured a little distance was good for everybody .
now it &apos;s too late .
this is the last of the container .
they &apos;ve been through everything .
more rats .
so we have no evidence ,
and our best suspect , uncle arthur , has three witnesses
who put him at his auto repair job at the time of the murder .
their coats are glossy .
healthy gums .
they ate rat poison , maura .
no , this isn &apos;t from rodenticide .
even fast @-@ acting poison takes a few days .
these rats died immediately after ingesting something .
something in the container .
maybe you should do an autopsy .
technically , it &apos;s a necroscopy .
well , let &apos;s not tell the taxpayers
what we &apos;re doing with their tax dollars .
got another delivery for you , doc .
uh , can you put it in my office , please ?
sure .
what is that ?
supplies .
for ian ?
yes .
for ian ...
who fixed your toe .
how is your toe ?
how is your conscience ?
excuse me ?
what are you doing ? who is this guy ?
why are you being so weird ?
why are you turning into a snoopy dog ?
do you mean snoop dogg or snoopy , the dog ?
either way , i &apos;m insulted .
too insulted to find out what killed your rats ?
okay , that is so not fair .
high levels of diacetylmorphine in the rats &apos; blood .
heroin . the rats o.d. &apos; d .
i &apos;ve heard of cases where smugglers
soak clothes in liquid heroin .
both rats had grayish blue fibers in their stomachs .
they ate the blankets in the container .
how much do you want to bet
this thing is soaked in liquid heroin ?
nothing . i don &apos;t bet if i can &apos;t win .
but why didn &apos;t the drug dog hit on the scent ?
because the scent of any animal would throw the dogs off .
so fill the container with rats .
smart .
i bet chris dunbar thought he &apos;d figured out
how to smuggle heroin into the country .
i want my lawyer .
better be a good one .
we just found $ 2 million worth of heroin
in your container .
you don &apos;t understand .
so explain .
start with your father &apos;s murder
and finish when you get to the part about the dead junkie .
i get a phone call .
i want to talk to my lawyer .
be my guest .
jane !
ian is a spy .
what did you do , ma ?
i found passports from different countries
all with his photo and all with different names .
you shouldn &apos;t have done this , ma .
what is that smell ?
it &apos;s my foot solution .
it &apos;s like a skunk made love to a farting dog .
hey , i &apos;m fighting a war down here .
what is the smell ?
combat under his desk .
did you poke around in chris dunbar &apos;s finances ?
just found a transaction
he completed this morning that makes no sense .
looks like he took out a line of credit on his business
so he could withdraw 2 million bucks .
right before we arrested him ?
wait . it does make sense .
heroin we impounded is worth about $ 2 million .
yeah . and if chris doesn &apos;t deliver the drugs ,
he &apos;s got to deliver the cash .
who &apos;s his lawyer ? he called him from downstairs .
i &apos;ll check the phone records .
can you have your interpol contact run these names ?
sure .
ian smith . ian walters .
ian franklin .
mm . same guy . i think he &apos;s australian national .
you think there &apos;s an australian connection here ?
you &apos;re not gonna believe this .
chris didn &apos;t call a lawyer .
who &apos;d he call ?
he dialed his own cell .
well , we better find who has that phone .
come on . we &apos;ll take maura &apos;s car .
what &apos;s wrong with yours ?
it &apos;s a cop car .
you &apos;re right .
prius is a great undercover vehicle .
e.v. mode .
mm . so quiet i can
hear your toenails crying back there .
roomy , too .
well , don &apos;t take off your shoes .

how long have you and your father

he had nothing to do with it .
all right , it was all me .
right , and it was just this one time .
and lee was your connection ?
yeah .
my father introduced me to all of his clients .
and lee , she said that she had a way
for me to make some easy money .
by smuggling dope .
yeah . yeah , as you can see , a real easy way
to make a couple million bucks .
it would have worked , too ,
except my father , he was so precise .
he noticed on the manifest
that the container from china was off by 50 pounds .
because you put 50 pounds
of heroin @-@ soaked blankets inside .
we found some residue from the nail salon
on your father &apos;s clothing .
he went to see lee the day he was shot , didn &apos;t he ?
yeah . i told him not to go .
but he said that there was no way
that he was gonna accept delivery of her container .
well , got him killed .
maybe you should have talked to us .
oh , come on . i couldn &apos;t talk to you .
the guy who shot my dad ,
he said i was next
if i didn &apos;t get him the container .
and what did he look like ?
i didn &apos;t see his face .
i &apos;m telling you the truth !
did you tell your uncle the truth , too ?
you nearly got him killed .
he was just trying to help .
all right , i called him when my family was taken .
all right , i didn &apos;t know what else to do .
arthur said that he would do it .
all right , he said that he would bring lee the money .
and you let him .
please , you have to find my family , right ?
they didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
it &apos;s maura . she says she &apos;s got something .
lee had a poultry mite infestation on both arms .
clearly it &apos;s a few months old .
how ? she worked in a nail salon .
what , she get it from a customer ?
no . she could only contract it
if she worked around poultry .
like a slaughterhouse or a packing plant ?
maybe there &apos;s a slaughterhouse
or a packing plant next to the nail salon .
check it , frost .
well , she &apos;d need a place to process the heroin .
yeah . she &apos;d need a chemical bath ,
a heating source , drying tables .
got something .
only one slaughterhouse in the boston area .
right near the nail salon .
health department shut it down six months ago .
utilities are still on .
good place to dry out your heroin and hide people .

i &apos;m sorry , maura . i shouldn &apos;t have done what i did .
it &apos;s none of my business .
i just -- i can &apos;t ...
i can &apos;t talk about him .
i can &apos;t . with anybody .
because it makes me so sad .
i mean , how can you -- how can you love someone
and not be able to be with them ?
well , why can &apos;t you be with him ?
because he went back to africa .

to bring drugs and basic supplies
to places that nobody cares about .
and i helped him , so go ahead and arrest me .
the first person i &apos;m gonna arrest is my mother .
