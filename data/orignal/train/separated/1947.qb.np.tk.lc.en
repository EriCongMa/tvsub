yeah .
i know the protocol .
cervical spine is fractured .
so are both legs . right foot has no pulse .
we &apos;re gonna need to stabilize his spine .
what did they say he was -- a cop ?
yeah , he fell off a building under construction
during a chase .
sorry it took me so long .
i was , um -- - it &apos;s fine .
we brought him straight in from the helipad .
central line is in .
transfuse him with two units of blood .
torres , you should look at his leg .
torres ?
yes . the leg .
all right , sir ,
i need you to follow my light with your eyes .

maybe we should have this conversation in my office .
look , i don &apos;t have time for ...
who died ?
amelia ...
i know the face .
i &apos;ve been here before .
everyone thinks they are the first person in the world
to ever look at a human being like that , but ...
it &apos;s always the same face .
who is dead ?
derek .
it &apos;s derek .
i &apos;m so , so sorry .
it was an mvc accident , and he wanted to help .
i don &apos;t need the details .
dead is dead .
i am so ...
so sorry .
i wish there was something i could --
thank you ...
for telling me .
amelia , if there &apos;s anything i can -- - i &apos;m good .
i &apos;ve done this before . i know the drill .
it &apos;s not a big deal .
oh , my god .
this is a day for us to celebrate derek shepherd &apos;s life
and for each of us to say our goodbyes .
every day we celebrate him in some way --
as a father , as a husband ...
... as a brother , as a friend .
it was a nice service .
i liked your poem .
if something happens to me ,
do not let them hook me up to anything .
nothing . understand ?
just ...
donate my organs and let me go .
if that &apos;s what you want ...
okay .
okay .
but if something happens to me ...
hook me up ... to everything
and never let them unplug me -- ever .
ben , i &apos;m not joking about this .
neither am i.
i want to live .
i want extraordinary measures .
the more extraordinary , the better .
seriously .
seriously .
seriously ?
no running ever .
that we &apos;ll take care of each other
even when we &apos;re old and smelly .
tumor is here .
now you &apos;ve completely lost your mind .
you &apos;re like coming up for fresh air .
it &apos;s you . it &apos;s always been you .
they offered me the job again .
take it .
someone doesn &apos;t want to put her shoes on .
look , she &apos;s just so happy .
you don &apos;t have any idea what &apos;s gonna happen , do you ?
derek .
derek .
richard , you can &apos;t leave me !
richard , richard !
i was swimming ...
and i let go .
i stopped fighting .
meredith , get up .
zo @-@ zo , honey , wake up .
put these on .
ok . you ready ?
where are we going ?
away , sweetie .
we &apos;re going away .
come on , sweetheart , let &apos;s go .
it &apos;s just so strange that she left with no warning .
she left a note .
uh , &quot; the kids and i are safe &quot; ? yeah , that &apos;s helpful .
i called yang again ,
but she hasn &apos;t heard from mer since the funeral .
are you serious ? that was weeks ago .
w-- okay , i just don &apos;t understand .
i don &apos;t understand . i do not understand how you --
you want to go to a meeting after this ?
i &apos;m good . thanks .
are you ?
&quot; so long , i &apos;ll see you later &quot; or ...
you &apos;re basically living at the hospital .
... &quot; trouble due to the fact that i am all ... &quot;
i &apos;m fine , richard , really ...
... &quot; world right now . &quot;
i mean , sh @-@ she just dropped everything --
her patients , her surgeries .
look , maybe it &apos;s time we hire a detective ,
make sure she &apos;s really safe .
yeah , i think we should call the police .
o @-@ okay , that &apos;s -- that &apos;s enough .
meredith grey is not a missing person .
she -- she left a note .
she &apos;s not jeopardizing her kids .
she &apos;s not an irresponsible person .
if she &apos;s gone , she &apos;s gone because she wants to be gone .
she &apos;s doing what she knows how to do .
same as her mother .
ellis grey left seattle and never looked back .
so , that &apos;s it ? that ...
we just let her go ?
you &apos;ve reached dr. meredith grey .
you &apos;ve reached dr. meredith grey .
and time isn &apos;t the same over there .
hours don &apos;t exist . there &apos;s only minutes , seconds .
it &apos;s visceral and exciting .
but you &apos;re chief .
well , not for the next few months .
webber is stepping in as interim chief .
the work i &apos;ll get to do is raw and urgent .
kepner , you just feel so useful and good
at the end of every day ,
and after everything that &apos;s happened here , i --
i &apos;m ready . i &apos;m ready for this kind of change .
i just need to feel 
useful .
and good .
yeah .
i don &apos;t care how sick the kids are .
i &apos;m not doing this next year .
our patient has 60 % surface area burns .
she was pulled from a house fire this morning .
are you even listening ?
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m sorry . i just ...
you need to prepare yourself .
burns like this are ...
difficult .
this will not be easy .
hi , anne .
dr. wilson and i
are here to start your first dressing changes .
i &apos;m so cold .
i can &apos;t stop shaking .
i mean , isn &apos;t that weird ,
that -- that i got burned and  i &apos;m cold ?
well , your skin and your nerves have experienced severe damage .
you are unable to retain heat or feel surface pain .
dr. wilson , do you want to walk anne through
what we &apos;re gonna be doing today ?
we &apos;ll debride the burns layer by layer
until we expose healthy tissue to ...
help new skin grow .
and it hurts like hell ,
so you might want to grab onto something .
the bed rails work really well .
who &apos;s that ?
that -- that &apos;s your neighbor , j.j.
she was admitted a couple weeks ago .
hello , j.j. - oh , and do yourself a favor --
grab something to bite down on .
that &apos;s not -- thank you , j.j.
is she serious ?
we &apos;ve got you under sedation .
barely works !
really , j.j. ?
we are going to do this as quickly as possible , okay , anne ?
um ... is my husband out there ?
oh , um , i don &apos;t see him , but we can track him down .
s @-@ should i -- -sure , yeah .
just -- just be quick , okay ?
ready to get started ?
okay . you ready ?
okay .
oh , ow , that -- that hurts ! - i know .
okay , you see , that &apos;s why you
want to get something to bite down on !
i -- i never -- i never said you were boring .
don &apos;t deny it .
i got the whole story out of a resident --
you thought i was boring .
that &apos;s why we never had a second date .
and , uh ...
which resident told you this ?
i &apos;m not gonna put my c.i. at risk .
that &apos;s a confidential informant .
it &apos;s cop talk .
i &apos;d elaborate , but you might think it &apos;s a little too boring .
relax , i &apos;m just messing with you .
okay , all right .
take it easy .
that graft we used to close your abdomen is breaking down ,
and you &apos;re gonna need another series of surgeries
just to complete the closure ,
let alone to complete your spinal fusion .
what about my leg ?
i know it &apos;s in pretty rough shape ,
but i &apos;m gonna need it back if i &apos;m gonna go back
to chasing crooks and leaping over rooftops ,
you know , all that super @-@ boring cop stuff .
come on .
don &apos;t make it that easy . give a little back .
i can take it , you know ?
dan , i can &apos;t make you any promises about your leg .
i &apos;m gonna do everything that i can ,
but i am not confident that we &apos;ll be able to save it .
there &apos;s a very , very long road ahead .
wow .
when you sling it back , you don &apos;t mess around .
but silver lining --
this means you &apos;ll have that much more time
to fall in love with me .
ow .
your face ...
priceless .
yeah .
how is what you &apos;re doing any different than meredith grey ?
we &apos;ve been over this --
because my husband didn &apos;t die ,
because i &apos;m not running away from anything ,
because this is an incredible opportunity for me
to learn surgical techniques that i &apos;ve never even dreamed of .
jackson , it &apos;s only three months .
you could at least pretend to be happy for me .
why ? i don &apos;t like it .
i don &apos;t .
it &apos;s dangerous .
i &apos;m not gonna be fighting !
i &apos;m gonna be doing surgery .
i &apos;m gonna be teaching , helping .
these are all things that you do here every day .
it makes me excited .
happy .
please ...
i need this .
i want it .
it &apos;s three months .
flight 721 to los angeles ...
my flight &apos;s about to board .
i -- well , i can &apos;t leave if we &apos;re like this .
will you at least kiss me goodbye ?
ready ? 1 , 2 --
y @-@ you do know what you &apos;re doing ?
i &apos;m a surgeon .
gonna ruin my day at the lake , poking a hornet &apos;s nest .
you know that &apos;s a saying .
people do not actually poke the hornet &apos;s nest .
i didn &apos;t do it on p--
ow ! what &apos;s -- what ?
you baby .
and you want to be kept alive forever .
you can &apos;t deal with a pair of sharp tweezers .
you want to be intubated , catheterized , multiple i.v.s ,
central lines in the neck and groin ,
and bed sores all because you can &apos;t get it together ,
let jesus take the wheel .
what ?
look , look , if i am lying in a hospital bed
in such bad shape that it has reached that point
that some doctor
is talking to you about extraordinary measures ,
i am not gonna let jesus take the wheel .
no , you know when jesus should &apos;ve taken the wheel ,
when he should &apos;ve been flipping his turn signals
a @-@ and shifting gears ?
when whatever bad thing that happened
to make me suffer a traumatic brain injury was happening ,
but instead , jesus was clearly out joyriding with someone else
because there i am gorked in a bed .
so , no , i &apos;m not gonna let jesus take the wheel .
i &apos;m not gonna let jesus anywhere near my damn car !
i &apos;m driving !
no , science is driving .
i did not stab him in the neck with these tweezers .
i want that noted .
hey . anything today ?
no . you ?
nothing .
still no word at all ?
she doesn &apos;t reply to e @-@ mails .
or her freakin &apos; phone .
two hours -- two --
for a routine neuro consult .
i get we &apos;re down a guy , but i &apos;m sorry ,
the board needs to get off their asses
and hire a new neurosurgeon already .
don &apos;t make a scene . it &apos;s not worth it .
i know .
well , it &apos;s irresponsible is what it is .
it &apos;s bad management .
how hard is it to find o--
really ? !
really ?
you think that we need t @-@ to just get off our asses ?
we should do you that solid
because the loss of our colleague and friend
is all about your needs , your schedule ?
you think that we should be sensitive to that ?
how about you take a minute
to think about the person , the talent , the life that we lost ? !
how about you think before you start complaining
that derek shepherd &apos;s death has been inconvenient for you ? !
i made a scene .
okay , there are hypertrophic bone spurs .
we just need to bite them off , and we &apos;ll be set .
so , no foraminotomy ?
i really don &apos;t think we need it .
oh , really ?
because i &apos;m not having any success with his leg .
he &apos;s ... probably gonna lose it
and dan and i were hoping
he &apos;s a viable candidate for a bionic prosthesis ,
so if he &apos;s in chronic pain or in a c @-@ collar for too long
and that delays rehab , which --
i realize this isn &apos;t the method
my dear , dead brother would have used .
his method would actually be clunkier
and offer less support than mine ,
so let &apos;s do it my way .
i don &apos;t think derek will mind , on account of he is dead .
cool ?
sure . totally , totally cool .
great .
rongeur , please .
oh , no , it hurts more !
honey , honey , you &apos;re doing great .
i know that it &apos;s painful ,
but that just means that you &apos;re healing ,
and then the more you heal ,
the more your nerves regrow .
... the more your nerves regrow .
yeah , isn &apos;t that a bitch ?
the better you get , the more it hurts .
a @-@ and then they send dr. wilson in here .
what , all the ugly doctors are busy
so they got to enlist snow white
to come and peel us like a grape ?
j.j. , you &apos;re not helping !
no , no , actually , that &apos;s -- that &apos;s funny !
she is p--
i know .
i mean , seriously , they &apos;re s @-@ sending in a disney princess ,
so what does that make us ?
the seven dwarves ?
two of them , anyway .
okay , i &apos;m , um , i @-@ i &apos;ll be burny ,
and you can be screamy .
and -- and , you know , there -- there &apos;s --
there &apos;s that guy down the hall
who just lost a leg
and -- and that woman who &apos;s in the trauma room next to me .
and she was , like , dying ,
but she wouldn &apos;t stop complaining
about the service she was getting .
they c-- they can be dwarves , too .
stumpy and bitchy .
stumpy and bitchy .
okay , i &apos;m gonna go again .
i &apos;m right here . i got you .
it &apos;s okay . you &apos;re okay .
it &apos;s okay .
you know who they should &apos;ve sent in here
was mary freakin &apos; poppins .
i bet she had some morphine
in that bag of crap she carried around with her .
okay , so we got , um , burny , screamy , stumpy , bitchy .
who else ?
for god &apos;s sake , shut up !
lance ...
okay , we &apos;re gonna take five , okay ?
lance ?
he &apos;s just scared .
this is scary for him .
then , um , he fits in perfectly .
okay , we &apos;ve got , um ,
we &apos;ve got burny , screamy ,
stumpy , bitchy , and scaredy .
we should try to find her .
she &apos;s not a rogue agent . she &apos;s not on the lam .
she &apos;s a single mother with two kids .
how hard could it be ?
really freakin &apos; hard .
i called anyone i could think of --
cristina , her father --
and then i thought maybe webber was right ,
maybe she followed in ellis &apos; footsteps .
so , i started calling hospitals in boston
and asking for dr. grey just to see if anyone would answer .
oh . wow .
yeah , here we go .
this isn &apos;t why i came to seattle .
i didn &apos;t know exactly why i was coming , but ...
i knew it had to do with finding out about my family ,
and i found meredith .
and then she ...
i never felt abandoned by my birth mother .
my parents never let me ,
not for a second .
were meant to be a family .
i believe that . i know that .
but ...
but i think this is how i would &apos;ve felt ...
if i had .
you &apos;ve reached dr. meredith grey .
look , cut it out .
it &apos;s not fair to any of us .
just tell me that you &apos;re okay and that you &apos;re safe .
that &apos;s all . just do that .
why haven &apos;t you been picking up today ?
i @-@ i &apos;ve been working .
okay , well , now i &apos;ve only got a couple mikes , so ...
who &apos;s--who &apos;s mike ? what ?
mikes , uh , minutes .
i just -- i @-@ i have to hurry .
oh , okay , well , only a couple more days of this , right ?
pretty soon , you &apos;ll be back here
and we &apos;ll be both on the same crazy schedule .
yeah , right , that &apos;s what i have to --
oh , i have a confession to make .
um ...
so do i.
... we have a new couch .
there was an accident involving mole ,
and a really exciting national league playoff game , actually ,
and , um , couldn &apos;t get the stain out , so just ...
new couch .
i &apos;m not coming home next week .
what ? - i just --
i can &apos;t
apr-- ?
... teaching people these techniques .
uh , we &apos;ve barely started .
i mean , the level of need here is so --
... children .
i mean , jackson , if you were here ,
you &apos;d know what i &apos;m talking about .
it &apos;s just--just , i don &apos;t feel like i &apos;m done yet .
understand ?
i do .
and ... i don &apos;t .
i mean , are you ...
are you telling me that &apos;s your decision ,
or you want to talk about this now , or ...
well , now , uh ...
no , i @-@ i can &apos;t--i can &apos;t now .
um , can i try you back at 1300 hours ?
i &apos;ll be sleeping . that &apos;s like 3 : 00 a.m.
all right , so , when do you think you can be home ?
a @-@ april ?
jackson
april ?
this is such a lovely meal .
really nice .
more than nice .
you keep me on my toes , catherine avery .
you make me very happy .
richard webber ,
if you are about to do what i believe you &apos;re about to do ,
you should stop .
catherine , w--
no , please , please .
you should not be asking this question
without knowing my answer .
well , i thought i did .
we are not new to this .
we know better than to get caught up
in some grand , romantic gesture .
we know what marriage really is .
it &apos;s a merger , a contract .
no one should enter a binding contract
without careful , lengthy , practical consideration .
sounds so romantic .
no , and it shouldn &apos;t be .
you know what ? yes , it should .
you know , i pulled back on the romance tonight
because i knew --
if i could ...
i &apos;d fill this room with roses .
i &apos;d have invited all of our friends .
i would &apos;ve hired a quartet or a soloist
or a damn mariachi band
to start playing the minute you said yes ,
because a proposal should be romantic .
it &apos;s--that &apos;s how i see it .
it &apos;s not a ... hollow gesture .
it &apos;s me ... telling you ...
how much i love you .
but , um ...
... clearly , we disagree .
i take it we &apos;re splitting the check ?
all right , where &apos;s the remote ?
you know , uh , people wake up .
statistically , people don &apos;t wake up .
well , who &apos;s to say i couldn &apos;t defy the odds
and -- and be a miracle man ?
there you go with the miracles again .
oh , you believe in jesus but you don &apos;t believe in miracles ?
um , jesus didn &apos;t hook you up to a bunch of machines .
jesus isn &apos;t an idiot .
okay , you know what ?
you and all your little snide comments ,
you can take them and you can--
oh , it &apos;s back on .
okay , see , she &apos;s about to die .
oh , she &apos;s definitely gonna die .
look at this guy &apos;s spinal abscess .
sloppy .
who was the primary ?
dr. nelson .
ah , it figures .
if derek saw this , he would roll over in his grave .
can you actually do that ?
roll over in a grave ?
i mean , a casket &apos;s pretty snug .
there &apos;s not a lot of room to move in there .
more like shake .
if derek saw this , he would shake in his grave .
shimmy , maybe .
please stop .
stop what ?
you &apos;ve been making a lot of jokes and comments about ...
my dead brother ?
yeah , which ...
no judgment--it just makes me very uncomfortable .
why ? it &apos;s the truth .
he &apos;s my brother ...
and he &apos;s dead .
y--there are some ...
i checked , and there are some grief groups that meet ,
and i just thought , look , i can go with you .
my grandmother passed last year .
it would be really good for me , too .
edwards , i have a morbid sense of humor , but i &apos;m fine .
i don &apos;t need a group .
but thank you . it &apos;s very thoughtful of you .
okay ?
okay .
let &apos;s just put it to rest .
like my brother .
you &apos;re doing great , anne .
it &apos;s okay .
just keep going .
okay . tell me more sbout how you &apos;re gonna fix me .
okay , well , our next surgery
is to remove skin from around your hips
and graft onto these cheek scars here and then here .
so , you &apos;re gonna chop off my love handles ?
did you hear that , j.j. ?
i &apos;m gonna get a smaller waist out of this .
oh , they can take whatever they want off my ass .
when do we get started ?
well , i just need to get that infection in your nose
under control before we start the grafting procedures .
i see .
so , where &apos;s husband of the year today ?
he was here this morning .
brought bagels .
she doesn &apos;t need bagels .
she needs a hand to hold .
so , um ...
so , it &apos;s still gonna be a little while
before we really get going with the grafts , huh ?
okay .
yeah , that &apos;s okay .
excuse me .
sorry about that .
no , no , no , no , that &apos;s dessert !
i am sorry , but that turkey is three hours away .
i didn &apos;t know it was gonna take all day .
didn &apos;t your mother ever teach you how to roast a turk--
no , &apos; cause i never had a mother
and i didn &apos;t have an oven in my car .
point taken .
doesn &apos;t help the fact that i &apos;m starving .
i have food .
oh , my god .
don &apos;t do it , alex .
hey , it was a good effort ,
but the only thing that bird is stuffed with is food poisoning .
oh , my god , i &apos;m so frickin &apos; hungry !
there .
hey ! hey , you &apos;re alive !
alex , listen ...
i &apos;m fine . the kids are fine .
we &apos;re okay . i &apos;m fine .
please stop calling .
so , my partner says ,
&quot; who &apos;s gonna play santa at the holiday party ? &quot;
and i say ,
&quot; i don &apos;t know . i &apos;m stumped . &quot;
please , that &apos;s the easiest amputation joke in the book .
yeah . you have plans for the holidays ?
um , yeah , my ex and i
are splitting christmas with our daughter ,
so i get christmas eve this year ,
and , uh , she gets christmas day .
dr. torres ...
well ...
callie ...
i need to say something .
dan ...
no , please , just ...
let me say this .
i think that i was ...
i was meant to meet you .
no , dan , dan .
dan , dan , dan , l @-@ let me say this .
when -- when a doctor cares for a patient
for an extended period of time ,
that care can often feel to the patient
like , um affection .
what ?
what ?
i meant as my doctor , but please keep going .
this is great .
oh , my god !
uh , look ,
that first date , it sucked .
i get it .
but it got me to you , and i think i needed you for this .
like ...
i couldn &apos;t have survived this without you .
so , thank you .
merry christmas , dr. torres .
merry christmas .
tuck must &apos;ve been not even slightly naughty .
do not mock divorced @-@ mother guilt .
oh , hand me that bow .
what if i met idris elba ?
what ?
well , you &apos;re hooked up to endless machines ,
having the time of your brain @-@ dead life
with extraordinary measures ,
and since you are technically alive ,
well , then i &apos;m not single ,
i am not a widow .
years pass , and , uh --
okay , i &apos;m not the kind of woman who --
okay , there are people who think that sex isn &apos;t cheating .
there are people out there who think that ,
an emotional affair isn &apos;t cheating . i &apos;m not either kind of person --
it &apos;s all cheating .
even though my husband is an idiot
who thinks that he will have a one @-@ in @-@ a @-@ zillion chance --
now , look , there are documented cases
of people waking up after years of --
there are documented cases of people
who &apos;ve seen the loch ness monster , too .
so what ?
i will be locked up like some nun ,
withering and wasting away lonely and alone
all because you &apos;re mad at jesus ,
so i don &apos;t get to have idris .
you &apos;re taking away my idris chance .
what ?
idris elba !
he could come to seattle , witness an accident ,
save a child &apos;s life ,
carry that child in his arms , bare @-@ chested ,
into my trauma room .
you don &apos;t know .
so , you &apos;re gonna pull the plug on me
so you can have your way with idris elba ?
it &apos;s idris elba !
oh , i ate too much pizza .
second batch !
deck your halls , y &apos;all !
i always hated eggnog . why is yours so good ?
mine &apos;s mostly hooch .
it &apos;s basically a bourbon milkshake .
cheers to that .
karev , that is definitely the saddest tree i &apos;ve ever seen .
tell robbins .
no , uh , it &apos;s better than no tree .
alex was like , &quot; why bother ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; you have to have a tree at christmas . &quot;
otherwise , your soul is just curdled
and you &apos;ve given up on joy ,
so i got a tree .
i started decorating it ,
and then some woman went into labor , so i gave up .
&quot; to zola , from sophia . &quot;
sophia keeps asking ,
&quot; mommy , maybe at christmas , we &apos;ll see zola .
shouldn &apos;t we get her a present ? &quot;
and i don &apos;t -- i don &apos;t know what to say .
i mean , i don &apos;t know if they &apos;re ever coming back .
hmm , i know the feeling .
so , i caved .
i got a gift , just in case .
that &apos;s the spirit .
hey , merry christmas !
merry christmas !
you came !
oh , i invited richard
&apos;cause he seemed a little sad and lonely .
is that okay ?
yeah .
i brought a yule log !
yum !
oh , here . come here . here .
move the dip .
how &apos;s karev &apos;s christmas @-@ not @-@ christmas thing ?
uh , it &apos;s okay .
karev scraped together some pizza .
i miss you . i wish you were here .
i &apos;m sorry . i @-@ i tried --
really ?
you &apos;ve extended this &quot; tour of duty &quot; thing
three times already .
what does that make you -- colonel now ?
jackson ...
april ...
it &apos;s christmas .
i know that .
don &apos;t you think i wish i could be there with you ?
you could , actually . you haven &apos;t been drafted .
you should be here .
we &apos;re supposed to be a ...
we &apos;re supposed to have a child .
we were supposed to be
celebrating christmas together , the three of us ,
and every time i think about that , i just --
kepner , we got to pack up and bug out .
what &apos;s going on ?
no , it &apos;s fine . it &apos;s just some insurgents that have been --
what is happening ?
um , i @-@ i got to go !
april ? hold on , april ? !
a--
he &apos;s not worth it . he &apos;s not good enough !
if he can &apos;t make it with you through this ,
then he &apos;s not good enough for you !
finally !
where does it hurt ? ! are you in pain ? !
her son @-@ of @-@ a @-@ bitch husband shows up ,
brings her that christmas present ,
and told her that this was not what he signed up for ,
and walked out on her !
okay , okay , deep breaths .
okay .
i &apos;m gonna -- i &apos;m gonna get you something to help you relax .
he &apos;s an ass , sweetie !
oh , yeah , he is an ass .
shh , deep breaths , okay ?
deep breaths .
you &apos;re okay .
but he &apos;s right .
he didn &apos;t sign up for this .
who would ?
i mean , i &apos;ve been here six months or seven .
i @-@ i &apos;ve lost count , and ...
and look at me .
i &apos;m disgusting !
he &apos;s married to burnt toast !
who would want to be married to this ?
who would love this ?
anne , honey ...
if this had happened to him , would you have left him ?
would you have loved him ?
he &apos;s not good enough for you !
he &apos;s not right !
this is the best christmas gift you could &apos;ve gotten ,
knowing that he is not the man for you .
and you don &apos;t have to spend one more minute
with someone who is less than you deserve !
you get to start over .
it &apos;s a gift .
we &apos;re starting over .
like it &apos;s our first christmas , okay ?
right ?
you know what we need ?
we need a little holiday cheer up in here , right ?
yeah .
oh , really ? really ?
songs about roasting things ?
that was an unfortunate choice .
no .
no noses .
no noses and no fires .
okay , um , how about ...
&quot; i &apos;ll be home for christmas &quot; ?
i know you &apos;re not sleepy ,
but you have to close your eyes or else he won &apos;t come .
will he bring me some toys ?
if you go to sleep .
will he bring me a baby sister ?
well , not tonight .
i wish daddy were here .
night @-@ night , sweetie . sleep tight .
i &apos;m just not sure of anything anymore .
i keep going over it round and round ,
over and over again .
like any other choice i make , might change things .
but no . this is the right place for me to be .
this is the right thing for me to do .
i know that . i just didn &apos;t expect ...
that it would hurt quite this much .
sweetie , don &apos;t go too far !
mommy .
meredith .
you grew up .
i did .
it &apos;s a shame .
it &apos;s awful being a grown @-@ up .
but the carousel never stops turning .
and i want more .
of this , of us , of ...
i want to have more .
another baby ?
sure .
uh , seriously ?
listen , i love you , and you love me , and ...
whatever happens ...
i don &apos;t care .
no more doctors , no more labs ,
and you and i , we have a lot of sex .
maybe we can make a baby , maybe not .
maybe you get alzheimer &apos;s ,
maybe not , but this ...
i am calling post @-@ it ...
zola and bailey ...
and tumors on the walls ...
and ferry @-@ boat scrub caps .
you &apos;re everything .
meredith , i can &apos;t live without you .
i don &apos;t want to live without you ,
and i &apos;m gonna do everything in my power to prove it .
you &apos;ve never lost the love of your life .
you &apos;ve never cried over the body
of the person you love most in this world .
you ...
you don &apos;t know how that messes a person up .
you &apos;ve never had to claw your way back from that .
i can live without you ,
but i don &apos;t want to .
i don &apos;t ever want to .
the carousel never stops turning .
you can &apos;t get off .
sir , i hear you saying that you have no answers ,
but i need you to have some damn answers !
that --
is everything okay ?
no , everything &apos;s not okay .
she should never have gone .
april should never have gone to a freakin &apos; combat zone .
i know . i know it &apos;s hard .
it &apos;s not just hard .
it &apos;s just -- - she lost a leg .
you know , with everything that happened this past year
with you and your baby , she ...
she lost a leg .
and she &apos;s learning how to walk again , and you ...
you have to let her do that .
why ?
why should i do that ?
why does she get to go off and put herself in danger
and just leave me here to ...
if she lost a leg , then i lost a leg , too .
but guess what -- i still get up every morning .
i face every day .
i don &apos;t get to jump on a plane
and fly halfway across the damn world
so that all that april has left of me
is some crappy memory of me
yelling at her from a picture on a phone !
wait , what happened ?
we were talking ,
and then there was gunfire , a lot of it ,
and the call got cut off .
and i have not been able to get ahold of her since .
i don &apos;t know ...
where she is .
i don &apos;t even know where she is .
all i &apos;m saying is ,
i just don &apos;t understand how you can know a man and love a man
and not see eye @-@ to @-@ eye with him
on such a basic , fundamental thing .
exactly .
richard wants to propose
by drowning me in flowers
and chocolate @-@ covered rose petals .
you &apos;d think a man would be grateful
for a woman who allows him to avoid that kind of nonsense .
or maybe it &apos;s just not about you .
i beg your pardon ?
nothing . sorry , none of my business .
well , you seem to have made it your business , so elaborate .
please .
maybe it just makes him feel good .
maybe it &apos;s easier just to accept a bunch of dumb roses
than to ask a man to fundamentally change who he is
or do what makes him feel good , when what makes him feel good
is telling you how good you make him feel .
maybe by not letting him give you that ,
you &apos;re actually taking something away from him .
sorry .
no , it &apos;s ...
you &apos;re protecting him .
i understand .
happy new year !
how are we feeling ...
good .
sorry , we were up all night ,
and i -- i know , i know that &apos;s bad ,
but we wanted to watch the ball drop ,
and then we started talking and we couldn &apos;t shut up .
so , i told her
that i would take the first torture shift today ...
ok .
... just let her sleep .
i feel like i fell asleep 10 minutes ago .
hey , did you know that j.j. was a volunteer firefighter ?
and then she gets burned at a --
at a tailgate party for a seahawks game , huh ?
oh , we sort of died laughing at the irony ,
and then we cried about it .
then we laughed again .
um , i &apos;m just gonna go grab something really quick .
wait , stop .
w @-@ what &apos;s going on ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
is it j.j. ? !
wait , i know something &apos;s wrong .
anne , you have to lay back .
j.j. ? ! j.j. ? ! j.j. ? !
you have to lay back .
no , no , no , no , no !
you &apos;ll tear your skin .
no ! no !
i &apos;m so sorry . i &apos;m so sorry .
she &apos;s gone .
oh , no , she can &apos;t be !
she can &apos;t !
i can &apos;t do this without her !
i can &apos;t do it alone !
i raised you to be an extraordinary human being ,
so imagine my disappointment when i wake up after five years
and discover that you &apos;re no more than ordinary !
what happened to you ? !
you &apos;re ignoring me .
um ... trying to .
you shouldn &apos;t ignore me .
why not ?
because i &apos;m someone you need to get to know to love .
really ?
oh , yes .
so , if i know you , i &apos;ll love you .
oh , yes .
you really like yourself , huh ?
just hiding my pain .
so , what &apos;s your story ?
my mother tried to kill herself when i was a kid ...
... after the love of her life disappeared .
i never told anybody that before .
so , you think i &apos;m broken ?
is there a reason for this ?
because if you can think of a reason , any reason at all ,
why the universe is so screwed up and random and mean ...
... now would be an amazingly good time to tell me .
because i really need some answers .
i know . i know you do . come here .
i don &apos;t ...
i can &apos;t ! i can &apos;t !
i don &apos;t ...
i don &apos;t ...
slow , deep breaths , slow , deep breaths .
here . take this .
slow down , slow down .
just breathe in . take a deep breath . go .
you can say anything to me .
i want to marry you .
i want to have kids with you .
i want to build us a house .
i want to settle down and grow old with you .
i want to die when i &apos;m 110 years old
in your arms .
i don &apos;t want 48 uninterrupted hours .
i want a lifetime .
he &apos;s gone , and i know he &apos;s gone .
and the bed feels lonely .
it &apos;s like ... i don &apos;t know how to sleep alone .
i miss you .
i believe that we can be extraordinary together
rather than ordinary apart , and i want to be --
okay , now , go slow , okay ?
go slow , concentrate , okay ?
you ready ?
yeah .
holy crap !
it &apos;s moving .
that &apos;s great . great .
that &apos;s great !
one more .
yeah .
yes , it &apos;s great !
that was the best first run of any patient i &apos;ve ever had !
you did it !
no , you did it .
i would never have done this without you .
um , okay , i @-@ i take it back .
i take it back . it was all me .
no , no , no .
it was you . i @-@ it was you , and it was me , and
the reason that your brain
can tell your new leg what to do is , um ...
it all started because of these ...
these , uh badass little sensors
made by an amazing neurosurgeon who ...
you &apos;re right .
we don &apos;t know why we meet the people that we meet , but ...
i wouldn &apos;t be here without him .
he was a brilliant surgeon , and ...
... he was a good friend .
and , uh ...
he would &apos;ve loved this .
he would &apos;ve -- he would &apos;ve loved it .
okay , uh , anyway ,
you want to go again ?
absolutely , yeah .
okay .
all right .
hi , laura .
i &apos;m here to start your first dressing change , okay ?
now we &apos;re gonna debride the burns layer by layer .
that &apos;ll expose healthy tissue
in order to help new skin to grow , okay ?
you &apos;re gonna want something to hold on to .
bed railings work pretty well .
this is gonna hurt .
who is that ?
this is your neighbor , anne .
oh , and do yourself a favor --
find something to bite down on .
thank you , anne .
i know the drill . tell her .
yeah , thank you , anne .
i &apos;m gonna get started now , ok ?
it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s okay .
you &apos;re gonna be okay .
sorry , i @-@ i should &apos;ve called .
they ordered us out really suddenly ,
and i was hopping planes ,
and then i thought maybe i &apos;d surprise you , but i can ...
see by the look on your face that --
uh , amelia , hey , got time for a cup of coffee ?
ah , sorry , busy day .
yeah .
uh , haven &apos;t seen you at a meeting in a while .
a long while .
like i said , really busy .
edwards mentioned something about you ...
really ?
what else is edwards saying ?
i &apos;m not accusing you .
i &apos;m checking in .
you know , i @-@ i get to check in .
that &apos;s the kind of friends we are .
i do not have time for coffee .
i do not have time for meetings .
i don &apos;t -- my job is not to make you feel better about me .
my job is to make my patients get better .
do you know what can happen
in the hour or two i would be wasting with you ?
an hour or two matters !
they matter to me .
they should matter to you .
they matter to my patients .
if i leave and my patient dies , it &apos;s not me who will suffer ,
it is his mother , his sisters , his friends , his wife ,
and they will hate me .
with everything inside them ,
they will hate me and you and everyone here
because they won &apos;t understand why he is gone ,
why people always leave ,
why everyone you give a crap about walks away
or is ripped from your world without warning , without reason ,
in convenience stores and plane crashes
and podunk hospitals with podunk doctors
who don &apos;t do what they are supposed to do ,
which is save people !
hey .
it &apos;s good to see you .
hey .
feels like i &apos;ve been away forever ,
but i see nothing &apos;s changed ,
except they chopped down that old tree .
yeah .
okay , i &apos;ll ...
i &apos;ll see you around .
i have a baggie full of black @-@ market oxy in my coat pocket ,
and i &apos;m trying to decide whether or not to take it .
i &apos;ve got the dead @-@ derek thing completely managed .
i know people were worried .
since he died , everybody &apos;s been looking at me ,
waiting for me to fall apart or freak out
or just become a mess .
like some bomb everyone thinks is supposed to go off .
my mother was calling three , four times a day .
addison was calling -- everyone .
it makes sense .
it &apos;s natural .
every man i &apos;ve ever loved ...
has died .
including my baby .
thank you , universe .
so , i should be , like ...
greek tragedy , turned to stone , bat @-@ crap crazy ,
but i &apos;m good .
i got this . i am fine .
i &apos;m telling you , i &apos;m amazing .
i am saving lives left and right .
i am putting butts in the seats in that o.r. gallery .
i mean , people are fighting to hear me lecture .
i am entertaining -- joke , joke , joke !
i &apos;m funny ! i &apos;m fun !
i &apos;m a party ! i &apos;m doing -- i &apos;m great !
i &apos;m handling the dead @-@ derek thing really well .
okay .
except today , i yelled at richard ...
who was only trying to invite me for coffee ,
and then i went and scored oxy from this junkie doctor .
but you haven &apos;t taken any ?
not yet .
but i might .
that &apos;s the thing .
i really actually might .
i have been sober for 1,321 days , owen .
i was fine . it was managed .
but i might .
all this stuff you &apos;re ... managing ...
you &apos;re not supposed to be managing it .
you &apos;re supposed to be feeling it -- grief , loss , pain .
it is normal .
it &apos;s not normal .
it is .
it is normal .
it &apos;s not normal to you &apos; cause you &apos;ve never done it .
y-- instead of feeling it , feeling the grief and the pain ,
you &apos;ve shoved it all down and you do drugs instead .
instead of moving through the pain , you run from it .
you ...
instead of dealing with being hurt and alone
and afraid that this horrible , empty feeling is all there is ,
i run from it .
i run off , and i sign up for another tour of active duty .
we do these things .
we run off , and we -- we medicate .
we do whatever it takes to cover it up and dull the sensation ,
but it &apos;s not normal .
we &apos;re supposed to feel . we &apos;re supposed to ...
love ...
and hate ... and hurt ...
and grieve and break and ...
be destroyed and ...
rebuild ourselves to be destroyed again .
that is human .
that is humanity . that &apos;s -- that &apos;s ...
that &apos;s being alive . that &apos;s the point .
that &apos;s the entire point . don &apos;t -- don &apos;t avoid it .
don &apos;t ...
extinguish it .
derek died .
he died .
i don &apos;t want to feel it .
i , i don &apos;t think i can .
i don &apos;t think i even want to ...
i can &apos;t . i can &apos;t .
i can &apos;t do this . i can &apos;t . - you have to . if you don &apos;t --
no , i can &apos;t . shh , i can &apos;t do this !
you ha-- you have to .
if you don &apos;t , that bag of oxy &apos;s not gonna be your last .
you &apos;re gonna be okay .
you &apos;re gonna survive this , okay ?
everybody does .
it &apos;s perfectly normal . it &apos;s boring , even .
it &apos;s so normal .
okay , zo @-@ zo , here &apos;s your snack --
cheese , bananas ,
and a little ... damn it .
it doesn &apos;t matter if i &apos;m hurting , does it ?
it doesn &apos;t matter if i &apos;m alone . where do i sign ?
ms. grey , it &apos;s important you fully understand ,
by signing these ,
you sign away all rights to your daughter ,
now and in the future .
and i &apos;m all alone .
now i have to raise my daughter alone .
how am i expected to do that ?
mom ...
i understand .
it &apos;s okay if you need more time .
more time ? more time ?
i needed more time with him ,
but it just keeps going forward faster and faster ,
and there is no more time .
you can &apos;t go back . you can &apos;t press &quot; pause . &quot;
the carousel never stops turning . it --
i don &apos;t need any more time .
where do i sign ?
damn it .
actually , you know , zo , i think maybe we &apos;ll take that , huh ?
we &apos;ll put it in a baggie , and we &apos;ll --
mommy !
it &apos;s okay , zola . it &apos;s okay .
you &apos;re bleeding . there &apos;s blood !
blood . it &apos;s just blood .
mommy , should i call 911 ?
not yet .
wait .
yes . call .
meredith ...
... don &apos;t be afraid . don &apos;t be afraid .
911 -- what &apos;s your emergency ?
my mommy tried to kill herself .
my mommy needs help .
are you the smart girl who knew how to call 911 ?
you might &apos;ve saved your mother &apos;s life .
dr. grey , we &apos;re just about ready to start .
my kids ? where are my kids ?
stop it !
she shouldn &apos;t be in here . no , wait .
don &apos;t touch me !
derek !
derek !
derek !
i don &apos;t want you to be alone .
if anything should happen to me , i don &apos;t want it to ...
just be you .
well , we would make pretty babies .
so , you &apos;re thinking about it , then ?
oh , i &apos;m thinking about it .
wait .
dr. grey ? dr. grey ?
your husband is here .
apparently , i &apos;m your emergency contact .
i had a baby .
i know .
derek is dead .
i know .
derek ?
derek ?
if there &apos;s a crisis ...
you don &apos;t freeze .
you move forward .
you get the rest of us to move forward .
because you &apos;ve seen worse .
you &apos;ve survived worse .
it &apos;s okay .
you go .
and you know we &apos;ll survive , too .
okay , sweetie .
it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s all right .
it &apos;s okay .
baby &apos;s name is ellis . did you see her ?
she &apos;s beautiful .
bet she looks just like you .
i didn &apos;t think i could do it .
part of me thought ,
&quot; what if i have this baby and just die ? &quot;
and then she arrived , and i saw her face ,
and i saw him in her .
she &apos;s beautiful .
happy valentine &apos;s day .
happy everybody &apos;s day !
oh , my child is with his dad in disney world .
he &apos;s in the happiest place on earth .
i &apos;m with you ...
naked , in this house .
that &apos;s a whole different kind of happy place .
now everybody &apos;s happy !
well , then , this is a very good time ...
to give you a present .
ben !
is this the plane tickets to paris ?
oh , &apos; cause if this is the plane tickets to paris ...
it &apos;s my living will .
it gives you full permission to pull my plug
whenever you see fit .
no extraordinary measures , witnessed and ...
notarized .
miranda ?
s @-@ so , um ...
b @-@ before ...
you wanted to be kept alive .
before you wanted extraordinary measures
because you had this stupid idea
that you were gonna be a miracle man
and wake up and come back to me , but now you ...
signed the papers ?
yeah .
i mean , t @-@ t @-@ that &apos;s what you wanted .
we &apos;ve been going &apos; round and &apos; round about it
for months , and , well , i just got tired of arguing ,
so i decided to go ahead and ...
sign the papers .
miranda ?
well , this was the meanest thing you &apos;ve ever done .
what ?
you no longer love me enough to hope for a miracle ?
oh , are you kidding me ?
from the beginning , you were shouting ,
&quot; unplug me ! unplug me ! &quot;
yeah , but you weren &apos;t supposed to do it .
i mean , you were , but y @-@ you weren &apos;t supposed to want to .
mir--
now you want to ?
miranda , why are you being so -- so crazy about this ? !
what &apos;s going on ?
h @-@ hey , hey , what is going on ?
i love you too much !
it &apos;s too much .
okay , my first husband okay , if he left ...
a piece of me always knew that i would be okay ,
and when he did leave , i was , but you ...
ever since derek died ...
i sit up in the middle of the night ,
gasping for air , terrified .
i &apos;ve been having these dreams
that something happened to you .
so , if something happened ...
i love you too much .
like , you are a piece of me .
i love you .
so ...
i need a plan .
i need rules .
i need some order ,
and i had just gotten used to your dumb miracle @-@ man idea ,
and now you &apos;re telling me you want me to pull the plug ,
and i can &apos;t deal with that .
i -- mm , just order and , uh , some rules
and a @-@ a plan and some order in the middle of this ,
&apos;cause if i have to think about what could happen ,
it &apos;s too mu @-@ much .
i promise -- i promise ...
that i will let you ...
die first .
that ...
... is so wrong !
hey , i love you too much , too .
here , let &apos;s ...
not think about this anymore , all right ?
we can &apos;t plan .
we don &apos;t know .
so let &apos;s ignore it and ...
... just stay here in our bubble , all right ?
here , together .
in the happiest place on earth .
in the happiest place on earth .
richard webber !
catherine ?
i &apos;m mad at you !
i &apos;m doing something i swore i never would .
i &apos;m asking a question when i don &apos;t know the answer .
because you ...
what &apos;s going on ?
because you &apos;re worth me standing here like a fool ,
announcing how i feel ...
in front of the entire hospital !
i love you , richard webber !
i love you .
and i would very much like for you to be my husband .
that is , of course , if you would like it , too .
well , about damn time .
come on , zo ,
let &apos;s get bailey and your little sister settled in .
now , wait , hang on .
alex hosted a christmas party ?
well , &quot; hosted &quot; is a bit of an exaggeration , right ?
whatever . there was a tree .
yeah , there was a sad , sad tree , god .
i have to believe there &apos;s a way .
there has to be a way to step off the carousel ,
to start again , to start fresh ...
there has to be a way to leave all my ghosts behind .
i &apos;ll see you around .
you &apos;re anything but ordinary , meredith .
it &apos;s a choice .
it &apos;s a choice i &apos;m making .
to move forward .
to move past this .
i can do that .
i can do that .
you ready for this ?
i am .
10 blade .
all i have to do ...
is begin .
