tess , there is such a thing as right and wrong .
you &apos;re married .
what if i wasn &apos;t ?
what you &apos;re doing , it only ends one way .
i wasn &apos;t the only senior partner who voted for hardman .
and i don &apos;t see you giving anyone else shit
the way you give me .
and by the way , when the chips were down ,
i backed you , i ousted him .
tell yourself whatever you want , louis .
but tell it to yourself .
i can &apos;t go away with you , harvey .
why not ?
the next time i have an option
to cross a line to save you ,
i &apos;ll send you packing and not think twice .
now get your shit together .
you need to go ,
and i need to get my shit together .
how nice , greeting me at the door .
when do you think are they gonna take that down ?
pearson ... just doesn &apos;t have the same ring .
pearson paulsen sounds pretty good .
okay . no , it doesn &apos;t .
how &apos;s my day ?
how was your night ?
and by night , i mean weekend ,
and by weekend , i mean zoe .
it was fine .
that &apos;s it ?
no fun banter ?
no witty repartee ?
and you &apos;re in the office at exactly 8 : 00 .
not early , which would mean it went badly .
and not late , which would mean it went great .
but exactly on time , which means--
you and zoe never went away for the weekend .
what happened ? do you want to talk about it ?
i have ice cream .
it &apos;s 8 : 00 a.m.
which is why god made chunky monkey .
it has chocolate and bananas .
bananas are part of a healthy breakfast .
and who cares about the bananas ?
it has chocolate .
okay , you caught me . i don &apos;t even eat the bananas .
8 : 00 a.m. means the business day has already started .
i &apos;d like to conduct some business .
well , in that case ,
trent devon would like to see you .
so schedule an appointment .
okay , you have an 8 : 02 with trent devon .
well , i didn &apos;t meet you at the elevator
just to chat about your weekend .
fine . get mike .
from home ?
you gotta be kidding me .
my client is here , and my associate is not ?
well , i &apos;m sure--
donna , i don &apos;t want to hear it .
the minute mike ross sets foot in this building ,
i want to know .
i think it &apos;s a bad idea , harvey .
we &apos;ll double the share price
by the end of the first quarter .
that &apos;s not what i meant .
i &apos;m just-- i &apos;m not sure going public is the best move right now .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m here .
trust me , these aren &apos;t valid reservations .
you &apos;re just getting cold feet .
harvey .
i &apos;ll have donna send you some fuzzy slippers .
you &apos;ll be just fine .
are fuzzy slippers gonna stop
the title 16 ruling that came down friday ?
you don &apos;t even know what that is , do you ?
no , i don &apos;t .
but what i do know is
it &apos;s not gonna change the value of your site .
you &apos;ve tripled your reach in the past ten months .
everyone is talking about you .
now is the time .
come on , we agreed on this .
what &apos;s this really about ?
it &apos;s about the changes around here .
nothing &apos;s changed .
i &apos;m here .
harvey .
i may be a tech head , but i &apos;m not oblivious .
this firm just went through a battle , and i know it .
are you telling me that you don &apos;t trust me
to put your needs above the firm &apos;s ?
no , i &apos;ve always trusted you , harvey .
i &apos;m just saying i don &apos;t--
i think you might be too distracted
to give me the best advice .
trent .
i have to consider my options .
about the ipo or pearson hardman ?
both .
we have a problem .
yeah ?
bernie carillo is thinking of leaving us .
that &apos;s absolutely not true , and i would know .
i have it on good authority .
so let me guess . it &apos;s my fault .
louis , i didn &apos;t come here to blame you .
i came here to give you a heads up .
you want to spit out what you &apos;re chewing on ?
yeah , you order me to rescind an offer
due to a firm @-@ wide hiring freeze .
i stake my reputation on it .
two minutes later , you hire a fifth @-@ year .
you went back on your word .
and you made me look like a fool .
i also gave you my word that
there &apos;d be no coming back from your vote .
and i &apos;m ready to go back on that .
we &apos;re losing clients , louis , and i can &apos;t have that .
so today is day one
of the louis litt rehabilitation program .
take it . move on .
it is time to heal the wounds .
i &apos;ll take care of carillo .
come on !
out with it . what &apos;d you do ?
i think i put in too much toner .
with carillo , you imbecile .
he &apos;s considering a change of counsel .
now , i want to know what you did
or more likely did not do to cause this .
what ?
i don &apos;t know .
what a shocker .
if you want , i can go back , and i &apos;ll retry--
no , no , no , no .
what i want
is for you to finish drafting the contracts
and deliver them to rachel zane
by 8.00 a.m. tomorrow morning .
then wait for further instructions ,
politely seated ,
with your hands crossed on your lap .
and if anything goes wrong ,
i swear to almighty god
that you are gonna rue the day that you decided to become
the embarrassment of a lawyer that you are .
louis litt does not lose clients .
is that clear ?
about the carillo contracts
or the fact that you don &apos;t lose clients ?
get out .
oh , sorry .
uh @-@ oh . wait a minute .
what is this ?
is that a triple nonfat sugar @-@ free mocha latte ?
oh , you sweet , sweet--
wait a minute . what did you do wrong ?
okay , i &apos;m offended . you &apos;re questioning my motives ?
actually , mike--
it &apos;s okay .
you haven &apos;t had your second triple latte yet .
i forgive you because i &apos;m in a forgiving mood .
right , but harvey &apos;s ...
i love the smell
of litigation in the morning .
not .
it &apos;s 8 : 30 .
yeah , in the morning .
it &apos;s 30 minutes past when you were required to be here ,
which means it &apos;s an hour past when you should be here .
okay , since when do we use a time clock ?
what are the new ftc title 16 requirements ?
oh , they &apos;re nothing . it &apos;s a nuisance .
trent devon &apos;s worried about them .
okay , well , all it is is another form to fill out .
so if that &apos;s what you &apos;re worried about , it &apos;s fine .
what i &apos;m worried about
is the fact that i could &apos;ve told him that
had you been at the meeting
this morning at 8 : 00 .
what ? i checked the schedule .
there was nothing on it for this morning .
it happened spontaneously , as things do .
and i was there .
you were not there .
did you not hear me when i told you to get your shit together ?
no , i did hear you , and i did
get my shit together , by the way .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m late this morning .
deciding to be late to get your shit together
is not getting your shit together .
get it through your head .
we just went through a civil war ,
and the world knows it .
we &apos;re weak .
and the law of the jungle says
the weak get eaten .
okay , harvey , i &apos;m sorry ,
but you need to ease up here .
ease up ?
you &apos;re telling me to ease up
when our clients are leaving ?
that &apos;s right , trent devon might leave .
people don &apos;t leave me !
i @-@ i--
enough !
your job is to help me , not to screw me .
if i tell you you did that ,
i don &apos;t want to hear that you didn &apos;t .
i should &apos;ve fired you last week .
you know what , i should fire you right now .
but i cut you slack because your grandmother died .
well , you &apos;ve used up the rope .
you keep it up , i will fire you tomorrow .
&quot; people don &apos;t leave me &quot; ?
donna , i don &apos;t--
i do .
he deserved it .
he deserved a slap .
you knocked him across the room .
what happened with zoe ?
she &apos;s leaving new york
to take care of her niece whose father is dying .
oh , my god .
harvey , i &apos;m sorry .
is there anything ...
no .
just one thing .
i don &apos;t think kicking the dog is gonna help .
wow , you look like hell .
jimmy .
you here to pick a fight with me ?
&apos;cause i &apos;m really not in the mood .
no , no , mike . it &apos;s not like that , man .
oh , yeah ? you &apos;re not still pissed at me ?
you gave me an out .
i might not have respected it at the time ,
but i do now .
as far as i &apos;m concerned ,
i owe you one .
okay .
yeah . let me buy you a drink .
two conditions .
one , you still owe me one .
two , you still owe me one .
as long as i still don &apos;t owe you one .
bartender .
it &apos;s good to see you , man .
you too , buddy . so what &apos;s going on ?
you had a bad day ?
yeah .
okay . so give it to me .
well , evidently , getting in at 8 : 30 can only mean one thing .
yeah , that you had your head up your ass from 7 : 00 to 8 : 15 .
how &apos;d you know ?
are you forgetting i used to work for louis too ?
and unlike you , i didn &apos;t have harvey there to protect me .
no , this was harvey .
whoa . ain &apos;t that some shit .
anyway , here &apos;s to the wonderful world of being an associate , right ?
yeah . pearson hardman .
what does that mean ?
i &apos;m at bratton gould , my man .
and i &apos;m happy .
no !
associates don &apos;t get to be happy , jimmy .
no , you do at bratton gould .
i got an office .
shoot me now .
that &apos;s great .
listen , mike .
when i said that i owe you one , i mean it .
&apos;cause you didn &apos;t hear it from me , but we &apos;re expanding .
so if you want to jump , just let me know .
i &apos;ll put in a word for you .
i can &apos;t leave harvey .
screw harvey .
i mean , what &apos;s he done for you ?
more than you know .
okay , maybe .
but a year under harvey specter ,
they would kill to have you .
and you wouldn &apos;t be the only one .
there are people from pearson hardman
going to bratton gould ? who ?
i can &apos;t tell you that .
jimmy , you have to tell me that .
mike , come on . if they knew it came from me--
they won &apos;t .
i saw clark and owens meeting with our partners .
if you &apos;re here to give me your letter of resignation ,
i &apos;ll accept it in the morning .
oh , that &apos;s ironic . i was offered a job tonight .
congratulations .
i passed .
you want credit for that ?
no , i want to do the job i already have .
apology accepted .
bratton gould is poaching our associates ,
clark , owens , but he &apos;s also coming after--
our clients . trent devon .
someone &apos;s whispering in his ear .
allison holt .
she was brought in about a month ago .
she was ready to throw you under the bus .
and jessica threw her out .
so you think she &apos;s in this for revenge ?
maybe .
but we both know who brought her in .
hardman .
you think this is him ?
hell of a view .
clark and owens don &apos;t deserve this .
which one is owens , by the way , the redhead ?
you don &apos;t even know who your associates are ,
but you &apos;re here to complain about losing them ?
you bitter because you were fired ?
i &apos;m not bitter , harvey .
unlike you , i don &apos;t take things personally .
and by the way , i was right .
i advised you to settle , and you settled .
your advice was for us to settle ,
and i lose my law license .
and my question is ,
was taking that deal your idea or daniel hardman &apos;s ?
you think daniel &apos;s behind this ?
you met with him six days ago .
i &apos;m not even gonna ask how you know that .
i told you before , jessica .
i &apos;m a straight shooter .
daniel wasn &apos;t dictating my actions then ,
and he &apos;s not now .
either way , we are filing a claim for tortious interference .
you &apos;re using privileged information to target our clients .
you really want to cry foul to the ref ?
you know who went to the ref more than anyone ?
michael jordan . he did it quietly .
and he got six rings ,
and he &apos;s my client .
maybe i should call him too .
you &apos;re not getting trent devon .
you can &apos;t keep people who want to leave , harvey .
everybody knows about your civil war .
pearson hardman is falling apart .
and i &apos;m telling you ,
the avalanche has already started .
the carillo contracts , they should be signed
and on my desk .
i know .
well , since you &apos;re so in the know ,
perhaps you can tell me why i don &apos;t have them yet .
because they &apos;re not signed .
not signed ?
i called earlier to have them messengered--
the story &apos;s already taking too long .
and they said they didn &apos;t need to see them .
still waiting .
they said they &apos;re no longer a client .
harold .
no . harold didn &apos;t--
louis , harold didn &apos;t do anything .
harold never does anything .
he got me the contracts first thing this morning .
he worked all night . they were really quite--
excuse me . they were really quite--
&quot; quite &quot; what ?
good , actually .
uh @-@ huh . and how many citations you correct ?
none .
you &apos;re lying .
no , i &apos;m not .
i don &apos;t care .
wow . yeah . that is a tattoo .
it &apos;s cool , right ?
yeah .
manatee--the slow , gentle cow of the sea .
uh , no . it &apos;s a shark actually .
totally . no--yes .
that &apos;s a shark .
that is a big , wide , fat shark .
you &apos;re fired .
you can &apos;t fire mike .
you .
you moron . you can &apos;t even get your firing right .
i &apos;m fired ?
louis , come on .
pack up your things and go . now .
but i did everything you asked .
i delivered the carillo contracts .
i don &apos;t care .
the client fired us , and now i &apos;m firing you .
times are tough , people .
we can &apos;t afford mistakes . we can &apos;t afford incompetence .
you can &apos;t cut it , get out .
there is no place for mediocrity here at pearson hardman ,
and there &apos;s certainly no place for someone like you .
everyone else get back to work .
you know . i didn &apos;t just do what he asked for carillo .
i went way beyond .
i didn &apos;t make any mistakes ,
and i know that they &apos;re not leaving because of me .
so why didn &apos;t you say that to him ?
because he makes me freeze .
you know , sometimes i wish
we would &apos;ve known each other at harvard .
yeah . yeah . harvard .
you probably hung out with duncan and those guys .
i hung out with the library .
i &apos;m such a loser .
no , you &apos;re not , harold .
look , for the record , duncan was a douche .
he was a douche .
totally .
like a douchy @-@ douche .
do you remember that thing he used to do with the--
i know .
you know what i mean ?
see , that &apos;s what i mean .
if you would &apos;ve known me there ,
then at least someone here would know that
i wasn &apos;t always like this .
people used to come to me for help on their essays .
we &apos;d sit in the quiet of my apartment
where no one was yelling at me ,
and i could think and write .
really ?
yeah .
here .
this is the first essay i wrote in law school .
look at the professor &apos;s comments .
holy shit .
louis is right . i don &apos;t belong here .
no , he &apos;s not .
thomas .
poconos weekend .
with the girlfriend .
which one ?
doesn &apos;t matter .
done . winters ?
lunch with the mayor .
campos .
lunch with me .
lunch with me .
benson ?
box at the garden .
have lundqvist meet him pre @-@ game .
does the king do that ?
he does for me . siebertz .
tickets .
super bowl .
broadway .
really ?
beneath that lumberjack chest
beats the heart of a songbird .
fine . anything but cats .
cats closed over a decade ago .
what took &apos; em so long ?
that &apos;s it then . we &apos;re done .
closed them all .
that &apos;s just foreplay . we didn &apos;t close shit .
i want to have talked to every one of my clients by the end of the day .
you stay on trent devon until he takes the call .
i will .
and , harvey ...
no one is leaving you .
okay .
harold is totally freaked out .
i think he &apos;s gonna have an ulcer ,
but the good news is he &apos;ll never disappoint you again ,
so you can go and magnanimously hire him back now .
why would i do that ?
um , i don &apos;t know , because you made your point .
you think that was a show ?
look , i know harold can be ...
harold .
he &apos;s an idiot savant minus the savant .
he tries hard . he &apos;s a good person .
yeah , well , then tell him to join the peace corps .
why don &apos;t you just give him a second chance ?
i did , mike . it was called his second day .
you realize you need cause , right ?
you want a cause ?
he left a zero off the hopkins settlement ,
which cost the client $ 360,000 .
he filed a motion with the appeals court
instead of the superior court ,
which accidentally triggered a death penalty review .
and then the one and only time that i take him to court with me ,
his fly was down ,
and he called the judge &quot; your owner . &quot;
you know why he does those things , right ?
because you intimidate him .
you brutalize him .
you &apos;re always talking about how great you are at grooming us .
well , you were not great at grooming him .
if he can &apos;t take a drill sergeant yelling at him ,
how can he handle people shooting at him ?
people don &apos;t shoot at us , louis .
don &apos;t they ?
okay . you know what ?
you want him to stay ...
fine . he can stay .
thank you .
one condition .
you personally guarantee every piece of work product
that harold sends out of this office
just like i have .
you check everything he does .
you cross every &quot; t , &quot; dot every &quot; i , &quot;
and still do everything you have to for harvey .
people may not be shooting at us , but we are at war .
so how does that work for you ?
do we have a deal ?
harold .
i was just coming by to wish you well .
thanks , rachel , but i think it &apos;s gonna be okay .
mike &apos;s talking to louis right now .
really ?
that &apos;s great .
well ?
there was nothing i could do .
it &apos;s okay . i know you tried , mike .
if it &apos;ll make you feel better ,
you &apos;re not the only person being let go this week .
well , clark and owens are only getting let go
because someone found out
that they &apos;re moving to bratton gould with mckinney and kline .
they are ?
yeah , i overheard it .
i guess some people will choose any port in a storm .
harold , good luck .
you too .
this sucks .
it does .
he didn &apos;t deserve that .
allison &apos;s not done .
we know . we &apos;re working all the clients .
no , it &apos;s more than that . she &apos;s taking mckinney and kline .
it &apos;s just two more associates .
no , it &apos;s more than that .
i tell you the rats are jumping ship ,
and you say it &apos;s fine , but donna nods ,
and you &apos;re busting out life jackets ?
you have a history of panicking .
he &apos;s not panicking .
clark , owens , mckinney , kline--
these aren &apos;t just associates .
they &apos;re the best fifth @-@ years .
they &apos;re louis &apos;s first class of associates .
he gave her a report card ?
harvey , you do not know that .
well , i &apos;m gonna goddamn find out .
stop .
just cut it out .
all right , i &apos;ll talk to you later .
bye .
i never liked you , louis .
you &apos;re a vindictive , sniveling rat ,
but i never thought you &apos;d betray your own firm .
i never betrayed this firm .
what do you call helping allison holt poach our associates ?
i had nothing to do with that .
i love this firm , harvey .
you were a traitor when you voted for hardman ,
and you &apos;re a traitor now .
like i &apos;ve told you before ,
i &apos;m not the only one in this firm who voted for hardman .
and i voted to oust him once i knew .
once you knew you had to save your own ass .
all right , you know what , harvey , just get out .
get out .
ri-- i did nothing wrong .
jesus !
you bugged my office .
you ran to hardman about the cm lawsuit .
you sold your soul for senior partnership .
and once you got it , you created a drug policy
with the sole purpose of firing me !
i did it for hardman .
maybe hardman wanted me dead ,
but you &apos;re the one who went out , got the gun ,
aimed it , and fired it at my head .
and it blew up in my face !
and what would have happened if it didn &apos;t ?
i was under orders .
were you also under orders when you ran
to hardman about monica eton ?
how do you know it was me ?
because i set it up !
because i know who you are !
are you still gonna tell me
you &apos;re not helping allison ?
harvey , i swear to god
i did not do this .
maybe not .
but now that you &apos;ve done what you &apos;ve done ,
i will never trust you .
pearson hardman is my life .
well , here &apos;s what &apos;s gonna happen from now on .
you and i , we &apos;re done .
don &apos;t drop by my office .
don &apos;t ask donna for information .
you &apos;re the guy that nobody wants
but we can &apos;t get rid of .
i &apos;m a senior partner .
so i can &apos;t make you leave .
but as far as i &apos;m concerned ,
you don &apos;t even work here anymore .
that glass does not look half @-@ full .
you &apos;re cherry @-@ picking pearson hardman associates .
i only want the best cherries .
then why not go after the gardener who grew &apos; em ?
you want to leave pearson hardman .
i &apos;m a proven commodity who delivers outstanding billables .
with an unparalleled knowledge of finance .
yeah , i &apos;m well aware of who you are , louis .
but how do i know that harvey specter didn &apos;t just send you here ?
&apos;cause i &apos;m the last person that harvey specter would trust .
just ask daniel hardman .
i did . he said you betrayed him .
like i said , i am well aware of who you are .
well , if you spoke to daniel , then you would know
that he lost pearson hardman not because of my betrayal
but because of his own .
my loyalty does not sway with the wind .
i &apos;m leaving pearson hardman
because there &apos;s no room for me there anymore .
you could go anywhere .
well , i &apos;ve done my homework .
you guys are expanding . you are hiring well .
you &apos;re gonna have a young staff that needs guidance .
you know that i &apos;m the right fit .
and i want to move now .
you have a non @-@ compete clause .
jessica is gonna waive the non @-@ compete
as long as i don &apos;t take clients .
i wouldn &apos;t if i were her .
well , you &apos;re not .
harvey wants me gone ,
and he has a way of getting what he wants , so--
there might be a partnership position for you .
senior partnership .
that , you &apos;re gonna have to earn .
i have earned it .
and i &apos;m not giving up what i &apos;ve worked for my whole life .
louis , you have made a tactical error .
you &apos;ve shown me all your cards ,
you can &apos;t offer any clients ,
and you &apos;re being forced to leave a place
that doesn &apos;t want you .
you are a very good fit for us .
but if you want to join us ,
you &apos;re gonna have to prove how much you want it .
please don &apos;t do this .
do what ? i &apos;m just negotiating .
you have an empty title .
if you come with us , i promise
that you will be truly valued .
well , that &apos;s it .
i &apos;ve talked to every client except trent devon .
well , i know why he &apos;s returning allison &apos;s calls
instead of yours .
because he thinks we &apos;re not focused .
that &apos;s not enough .
come on . you taught me to always ask ...
what &apos;s in it for him ?
&quot; if we &apos;re looking to expand our reach ,
then trent devon &apos;s data platform
provides the perfect symbiosis with our search algorithms . &quot;
page 23 , the ceo of flash @-@ start .
allison doesn &apos;t represent them .
google bought meebo for $ 100 million .
allison is trying to do the same thing with flash @-@ start .
allison doesn &apos;t represent them .
pretend she does .
trent gets $ 100 million ,
but his company gets swallowed up ,
and that &apos;s not what he wants .
well , what if they let him run both companies ?
that &apos;s too good to be true .
it &apos;s happened before .
so if that &apos;s true , all we need to do
is figure out a way to beat that deal .
we can &apos;t beat that deal .
okay . so what do we do ?
why didn &apos;t you just tell me ?
allison said you had a history
and that it might get in the way of what she was offering .
flash @-@ start .
very good .
but allison doesn &apos;t represent them .
no , but she does represent a hedge fund
that &apos;s about to buy a controlling interest .
and let me guess .
they want you to run the whole thing .
we &apos;ll take on google .
and let me guess .
you &apos;re here to try and beat it .
no , i &apos;m here to tell you to take it .
if i were you , i would ,
and i would hire the lawyer who brought it to me .
thanks , harvey .
you &apos;re welcome .
there &apos;s just one thing .
i wonder , what &apos;s in it for her ?
what are you implying ?
let me look over the deal . my own time .
if it is what she says it is , i &apos;ll tell you .
if it &apos;s not , you &apos;ll want to know .
harvey , i already told you--
look .
you said we weren &apos;t focused ,
and i &apos;m not here to try to convince you that we were .
but you also said you &apos;ve always trusted me ,
and i &apos;m telling you , trust me one more time .
louis . do you need something ?
actually , yes .
i need you to waive my non @-@ compete ,
so i can take a position at another firm .
bratton gould .
i had nothing to do with allison holt &apos;s poaching .
what did she offer you ?
i went to her .
why ?
i got harvey &apos;s message .
what message ?
you don &apos;t know ? it doesn &apos;t matter .
this is what he wants .
and this is what you want ?
you know you can &apos;t take clients .
oh , i wouldn &apos;t even if i could .
i have no desire to hurt our firm--
your firm .
do you know why i instituted
the louis litt rehabilitation program ?
because i was seduced by daniel hardman once too .
he made me feel special and smart
and valued .
the problem was
he really didn &apos;t give a sh-- about me .
but i will give him one thing .
he was right about you .
you deserve a senior partnership .
i &apos;m gonna let you go , louis .
just for the record ,
i am not on the same page as harvey .
i don &apos;t want you to go .
what ?
were we really quitting ,
or was that just a move to get to the contract ?
you don &apos;t think i have his best interests at heart ?
that &apos;s not what i asked .
if it &apos;s a good deal , he should take it .
but you said it &apos;s too good to be true .
what else did i say ?
that it &apos;s my job to help you .
so what are you gonna do ?
i &apos;m gonna go find out what &apos;s too good about it .
good @-@ bye , mike .
hey , you can quit all you want ,
but trent devon is not leaving .
okay . good talk .
yeah . you know who i am , asshole .
i &apos;m sorry . okay ?
for what ?
sleeping with my wife ?
what , you didn &apos;t do it on purpose ?
it &apos;s over . okay ?
i swear to god .
you think it &apos;s that easy ?
keep your goddamn apology ,
and stay the hell away from tess !
oh , my god . what the hell happened to you ?
oh , i don &apos;t want to talk about it .
with me . now .
this isn &apos;t the first @-@ aid kit from the kitchen .
use other people &apos;s antibacterial cream ?
please , i might as well give myself a staph infection .
it &apos;s antibacterial .
that &apos;s what they want you to believe .
but you &apos;re using it .
shh .
looks like it &apos;s gonna bruise .
oh , look , i &apos;m sure it &apos;s gonna be fine , it &apos;s--
how do you know how to do this ?
bruno used to get into these fights with this maine coon on the 37th floor .
pumpkin .
no , i don &apos;t need it .
here you go .
i don &apos;t need tissues .
are you sure ?
put them down .
are you gonna tell me what happened ?
it &apos;s new york . i got jumped .
didn &apos;t you call 911 ?
to have the police come and ask a million questions
about a guy who they &apos;re never gonna catch ?
no , thanks .
you knew him .
let &apos;s just say that actions have consequences .
okay .
i get it . yeah , i get that .
we gonna talk about that box you were carrying ?
oh , man . what box ?
the box full of personal things from your office ?
like you said , actions have consequences .
jessica fired you .
she asked me to stay .
she did ?
yeah , because she knows that i would never sell out this firm .
well , then i don &apos;t understand , what are you--
mike , do i have to spell it out for you ?
you &apos;re harvey &apos;s right hand . he hates me .
so ? jessica &apos;s the boss .
come on , harvey &apos;s always hated you .
no , actually .
harvey hasn &apos;t always hated me .
we were never elmer and bugs .
we were ... ralph and sam .
who ?
ralph wolf and sam sheepdog .
the cartoon characters ?
yeah .
they came to the meadow every day to work , friendly .
but then when they punched in the time clock ,
ralph would try to steal the sheep ,
and sam would stop him .
i mean , it was brutal .
and then they &apos;d punch out again .
friends .
and that was me and harvey .
harvey &apos;s not punching out anymore .
and i can &apos;t walk in here every day
knowing that i &apos;m gonna be working side by side next to somebody who despises me .
i just-- mike , i can &apos;t .
louis , if actions have consequences ,
then maybe actions can redeem you .
no , it &apos;s too late for that .
die &apos;s been already cast .
here . you can send me a new tube of arnica at your convenience .
you don &apos;t have to stay ,
but i have some merger projections that i have to go through for harvey .
and i &apos;m pretty sure i &apos;m gonna be out of my depth .
morning .
thought i &apos;d get in early and destroy allison holt .
how &apos;s that going ?
it &apos;s a work in progress .
louis &apos;s letter of resignation .
found it on my desk this morning .
good .
no .
not good , harvey .
we can agree to disagree .
we &apos;re not agreeing on anything .
you pushed louis out the door .
it was not your call to make .
louis may or may not have helped allison ,
but he has betrayed you , me , and this entire firm .
we &apos;re better off .
if you really believe that ,
then something &apos;s got you off your game .
jessica , i &apos;m not off my--
no .
not you . me .
your job is to help me .
and when i say you are off your game ,
you say , &quot; how do i get it back ? &quot;
i went to louis to get him back on board ,
and you made an end run around me .
when does it stop ?
we can &apos;t let trent go with allison .
he &apos;s gonna ... get screwed .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s nothing .
it &apos;s just some stairs .
oh , god .
i &apos;m so sorry . i didn &apos;t see her there .
who did this to you ?
i &apos;m fine .
you &apos;re not .
and after i &apos;m done kicking his ass ,
the guy who did it isn &apos;t gonna be either .
harvey , just let it go .
that &apos;s not who i am .
i deserved it .
what did you do ?
i don &apos;t want to tell you .
i wouldn &apos;t call this getting your shit together .
i don &apos;t want to tell you because of the story
you told me about your mom and your dad .
you got off easy .
i know .
it &apos;s a bad deal .
what , you &apos;re reading between the lines ?
&apos;cause i couldn &apos;t find anything in the contract .
because the problem &apos;s not in the contract .
you said it yourself . the deal &apos;s too good to be true .
the financials don &apos;t support it .
what , you get your mba overnight ?
no .
you went to louis ?
we worked all night .
he didn &apos;t betray us , harvey . he found the problem .
they never wanted anything to do with trent &apos;s company .
after the deal , they &apos;re just gonna sell it off for spare parts .
that won &apos;t get them what they paid for it .
but it &apos;ll get them what they wanted .
trent .
exactly .
louis figured this out ?
trent &apos;s contract has the same problem as louis &apos;s .
he &apos;s got a non @-@ compete .
they couldn &apos;t get him to run the company unless they bought his .
now louis wants back in .
no , he doesn &apos;t .
this is just his way of saying he &apos;s sorry .
it &apos;s not on the menu , but might i suggest
the &quot; i got my ass kicked &quot; martini ?
it goes well with the &quot; second @-@ tier law firm &quot; potato skins .
those come with bacon ?
i don &apos;t know , never had &apos; em .
i take it my client &apos;s not coming .
he was your client ,
but then you offered him a deal too good to be true .
you got the paperwork .
because he trusted me .
well played , harvey .
no . here &apos;s the play .
he &apos;s gonna take his company public , like i told him two months ago .
a deal my new client , a certain hedge fund ,
just agreed to underwrite .
you know edelson investments , don &apos;t you ?
i do .
apparently , i used to represent them .
ah , you &apos;re taking this well .
what do you want me to do , cry ?
harvey , we play the game .
sometimes we win , sometimes we lose .
not me .
which brings me to a suggestion of my own .
come work for bratton gould .
come work for you ?
with me .
did you not hear what i said about the potato skins ?
you &apos;re second @-@ tier .
what about you ?
there &apos;s blood in the water , harvey .
you may have fended off this attack ,
but we &apos;re not the only ones circling .
we fended you off , we &apos;ll fendff the rest .
with who ?
i got all your best senior associates ,
your future , and i &apos;m not done .
we &apos;ll see about that .
lunch is on us .
after all , we just landed a huge , new client .
you say &quot; we , &quot; but i don &apos;t see your name on the door .
mike , mike , mike . i got your call .
you said you owed me one , right ?
yeah , and i meant it too .
well , you &apos;re gonna pay me back .
i &apos;m happy to , &apos; cause listen to me ,
when i bring you in ,
and you kick ass , i look kick @-@ ass .
got your resume ?
right there .
you gotta be kidding me .
oh , you didn &apos;t think it was gonna be easy to pay me back , did you ?
harold ?
i &apos;m not gonna look kick @-@ ass .
i &apos;m gonna look ass @-@ kicked .
look at how he did .
are you kidding me ?
you keep saying that .
man , we talking about the same harold ?
i know .
seriously , mike , man ,
if this doesn &apos;t work , i &apos;m gonna look like shit .
jimmy , he needs a second chance
just like you did .
all right , all right .
you won &apos;t regret it .
harold &apos;s great .
you &apos;re gonna love his new tattoo .
he &apos;s here , isn &apos;t he ?
right over there .
not only do you retain one client ,
you landed another .
i knew there was a reason why i kept you around .
and a reason allison holt &apos;s trying to steal me away .
congratulations . i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll be very happy .
what could possibly go wrong ?
congratulations . that &apos;s what i said to mike .
him too ? she &apos;s after everyone .
don &apos;t worry . he &apos;s staying .
loyal as a basset hound .
oh . are they particularly loyal ?
i turned her down .
but ?
i want my name on the door .
i don &apos;t want to end around you anymore .
i want to discuss things with you as an equal .
it &apos;s a little late for that , don &apos;t you think ?
how long are we gonna walk by his name on the wall , huh ?
they &apos;re coming after us ,
and they &apos;re not gonna stop until we send them a message
that we are whole .
i &apos;m not gonna just slap
someone else &apos;s name up there , harvey .
&quot; someone &quot; ?
i told you once .
you don &apos;t make decisions when you &apos;re reeling from a loss .
and your response was , &quot; let &apos;s quit today . &quot;
not quit . fight .
without any thought for the consequences .
with my gut , which serves me well .
as a closer , not a leader .
jessica .
watson , glyman ,
gallo , goldberg , specter .
the first five senior partners you named .
the first five major moves i made .
all success stories .
last week , you had me steal someone
from the d.a. &apos; s office for reasons you won &apos;t say .
we won &apos;t even go into what you did to louis .
and then there &apos;s the cherry on top .
mike .
who showed up this morning
beaten to a pulp .
he also beat hardman to a pulp .
one day , what he is
isn &apos;t going to be enough to make up for what he isn &apos;t .
which is how you feel about me .
harvey , what was michael jordan &apos;s record on the bulls ?
664 wins , 285 losses .
more than twice as many wins than losses .
do you know what his record was in the front office ?
no .
185 to 291 .
almost twice as many losses as wins .
you know how i know that ?
because you knew one day , i &apos;d come in here
asking for this .
because i look at the future
like an adult .
are you saying it &apos;s a no ?
i &apos;m saying i &apos;m not rushing this decision
and that your judgment that day was wrong .
thank you .
i thought you &apos;d like to know that
harold got a job at another firm .
good .
look , rachel--
he found out , didn &apos;t he ?
i just want you to know that it was
after i ended things with tess .
