we cover up injuries ...
with tape and gauze ...
have you seen dr. avery ?
upstairs in the lab .
... to protect the injury ,
to prevent infection ,
to save the patient from further suffering .
the hard part comes when you have to rip the bandage off ...
... because that can hurt like hell .
how &apos;s it going ?
pretty good .
what &apos;s up ?
nothing . have you talked to april ?
no .
why ?
nothing .

that i went on a date .

to get her feelings hurt here , okay ?
so just do me a favor .
keep it to yourself . be great .
april &apos;s pregnant .

okay . all right . bye .
so you &apos;ve been talking about me .
that &apos;s not necessarily a good thing .
you haven &apos;t given me an answer .
drinks .
tomorrow .
unless , of course , i change my mind .
when were you gonna tell me ?
now . right now .
i was coming up to tell you now .
i &apos;m supposed to believe that ?
yes ! i can &apos;t believe that arizona would say --
when did you know ? how far along are you , april ?
i &apos;m 12 weeks .
12 weeks .
i was coming to tell you --
when did you know ? did you know before the divorce ?
did you know before we signed those papers ?
april ? i - - yes . i ...
yes , i did .
i knew before .
why ? why would you do --
i have to -- i have to go .
no , you don &apos;t .
i am being paged to the er .
so give it to grey or hunt or literally anybody ,
but you &apos;re not gonna walk away from this right now .
i can &apos;t .
i want to talk about this , jackson .
i know we need to talk about this ,
but now is not a good time .
don &apos;t you walk away .
okay ?
i cannot talk about this right now .
you should get a dog . you seem like a dog guy .
i live in a trailer .
yeah , that &apos;s something we can talk about .
you don &apos;t like my trailer ?
no , sure , i also like grown @-@ up houses .
listen , i was thinking we could have dinner tomorrow ?
it &apos;s my birthday , and i can &apos;t think of anyone else
i &apos;d rather celebrate with , so ...
tomorrow &apos;s your birthday ?
no , no . it &apos;s next week ,
so you still have time to buy my gift ,
but i was thinking we could , you know ,
kick things off with dinner .
do you like lobster ?
love lobster .
you know how to cook lobster ?
sure , you just boil a pot of water and --
yeah , see . you &apos;re already losing me .
crap . incoming .
tomorrow night , then .
lobster .
birthday lobster , which you are cooking .
that &apos;s become obvious .
we &apos;ll start with kelsey &apos;s double lung transplant first ,
and then , assuming the procedure goes well ,
we &apos;ll go ahead and do the liver and pancreas .
and it has to be all at once ?
her cf has compromised her lungs , liver , and pancreas .
replace any one of those organs now ,
and the others are just gonna break down .
i know it seems overwhelming .
the surgery &apos;s long and extensive ,
but this is our best shot .
i don &apos;t want to do it .
sweetie , please .
kelsey , you know how important this is .
i don &apos;t care . i don &apos;t want to do it .
i hear you . it &apos;s a bummer , though .
this donor is a perfect match -- one in a million .
you know , if we do this now ,
you can make your spring formal .
didn &apos;t you say what &apos;s his name ask you ?
sam ? or steve ? or ...
parker .
well , i guess parker can find someone else .
i don &apos;t want to go if i can only sit and watch and be pitied .
what , are you kidding me ? with these lungs ?
they &apos;re gonna have to drag you off that dance floor .
really ?
really .
so , dr. karev , how do we proceed ?
what &apos;s the first step ?
is that the kid alex paged us about ?
yep . triple organ transplant .
lungs , liver , pancreas -- the trifecta .
it &apos;s gonna be a long night .
i better text the sitter .
so , not that it &apos;s any of my business ...
it &apos;s not .
he asked me out .
it &apos;s not a big deal .
so you said no ?
you said yes ?
kind of .
maybe .
it &apos;s drinks .
good . you &apos;re free . you awake ?
yeah , i &apos;m good .
this is good .
can we not ?
you &apos;re ready .
i thought i wasn &apos;t ready with deluca ,
but now that it &apos;s out in the open , it &apos;s good .
what &apos;s good ?
thorpe , the military doctor .
he asked mer out . she said yes .
she said yes to buy time .
she &apos;ll blow him off later . she &apos;ll cancel .
you didn &apos;t see this guy .
i don &apos;t have to .
i know mer .
i know mer , too .
i am mer . mer &apos;s right here .
i said yes . i &apos;m going .
this is good .
blake , activate the mtp .
we &apos;re gonna need blood , lots of it .
on it .
all right , patient &apos;s 10 minutes out , people .
let &apos;s move .
april , i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m so , so sorry .
i thought that i was --
i really don &apos;t give a crap what you thought .
listen , i was with you before .
i lived through that with you , with jackson ,
and i just was trying to help somehow
so that maybe this time it could be different .
sorry , you were there ? you lived through that ?
um , no . no , arizona .
that was me and that was jackson .
we lived that nightmare , and i refuse to live it again .
and you know what ? it is different this time ,
because this time i am choosing to have faith
in a good outcome for this baby
until god himself tells me otherwise ,
and jackson ca-- keps .
i will deal with this myself ,
the way i want to , when i want to .
i know . i &apos;m sorry , april . i thought --
don &apos;t . don &apos;t think about me .
don &apos;t talk to me . don &apos;t even look at me , okay ?
and i believe in this stuff ,
so understand how much i mean it
when i tell you go to hell .
what , you didn &apos;t tell him ?
come on . keps , what were you thinking ?
shut up .
well , of course he had a right to know .
shut up . - i &apos;m just saying --
hey , i &apos;m just saying he &apos;s justified .
all right ? i &apos;d be pissed , too .
i &apos;d be really pissed .
28 @-@ year @-@ old female ,
fell over a hundred feet while rock climbing .
gcs 12 , intubated , multiple extremity fractures .
vitals are -- - tess . tess .
her name is tess .
you want to watch him , too . mild signs of dehydration .
i &apos;m okay . just help tess , please .
all right , tess . we got you , okay ?
you stay with us , all right ? stay with us .
volumes and total lung capacity are perfect .
replantation is technically easier on the right ,
so we will do that side first .
thank you for coming back in .
you really think i &apos;d miss out on a triple organ transplant ?
oh , sorry .
um , can you make sure that they have bypass on standby ,
and , um , tell the blood bank to have six units on hold .
okay .
why aren &apos;t you at dinner ?
we postponed . it was really weird .
it &apos;s not weird .
dinner for two with weber ?
it &apos;s weird .
it &apos;s what you wanted . out in the open .
if i &apos;m gonna have dinner with your dad , you should be there , too .
i know . i &apos;m sorry . i just got pulled into this .
you know , it &apos;s actually gonna be really cool .
do you want to scrub in ?
yeah .
i &apos;ve got wilson and cross scrubbing in now ,
but i could switch things up .
no , no , no . see , don &apos;t do that .
we haven &apos;t even started yet .
if cross is your intern , let him do it .
i &apos;ll -- i &apos;ll see you tomorrow .
no , no , no , no , no . i can get you both in there .
you can take turns holding retractors or something .
don &apos;t you want to see this ?
why ?
got to wake up .
just got called into a triple organ transplant .
long night .
callie ?
i have a thing ...
tomorrow night .
uh , more , please .
drinks with a guy .
you &apos;re getting back on the horse !
that &apos;s -- ooh , is it the , uh , is is the thorpe horse ?
please tell me it &apos;s the thorpe horse ,
because that is a hot horse .
that is -- that is secretariat .
no one &apos;s getting on a horse .
it is gonna be weird .
well , at first it &apos;ll be a little weird ,
but not bad weird , and , mer , it &apos;s good .
just getting back out there , it &apos;s ...
it will be good .
thanks .
if it &apos;s bad , it &apos;s still good , you know ?
i mean , it &apos;s like trying to remember how to ice skate .
a couple minutes , you &apos;re like , &quot; whoa , oh , crap .
what -- what am i doing ? &quot;
but then -- then you remember how it works
and then it &apos;s like ,
&quot; oh , yeah . yeah , i can do this . &quot;
&quot; oh , i like this .
ooh , ooh , i &apos;m good at this .
it &apos;s skating time , my friend .
push and glide . push and glide .
you know &quot; ?
i &apos;m more of a roller girl , myself .
she &apos;s hypoxic on 100 % .
okay , she &apos;s gonna need another tube on the right .
it &apos;s all right , tess . i &apos;m right here .
blake , can you get that ?
on it .
sir , michael , you need to leave the room .
we need room to work .
don &apos;t worry , baby . i &apos;m not gonna leave you , okay ?
i love you . i love you . i love you so much .
bp &apos;s dropping .
what &apos;s happening ?
free fluid in the belly and she &apos;s still hypotensive
after multiple units of blood and plasma .
we got to get her up .
blake , when you &apos;re done there ,
we need to get her ready for transport .
no , no , no . i can &apos;t leave her .
your daughter suffered severe injuries from the fall .
we &apos;re doing everything we can .
is that her ?
oh , my god . tess .
another set of hands up in the or ?
i &apos;ll be right there .
i love you , tess . i love you so much .
michael . we told you .
we told you not to take her on that mountain .
why are you always taking her on those damn mountains ?
uh , is there a place ,
uh , where i can wait for her during surgery ?
we all want to wait .
i &apos;ll take you all somewhere more private .
all right . none of us knew this was happening tonight ,
and we &apos;re all tired , so let &apos;s be smart .
we have three organs from the donor
being transplanted into the recipient .
there &apos;ll be long stretches where not everyone is needed .
take that time to nap , eat , hydrate .
don &apos;t come into my or at less than 100 % .
kelsey is prepped and ready .
all right .
start time -- 23 : 58 .
10 blade .
so we &apos;ll be up next , cross .
where &apos;s he taking you ? did he say ?
let it go .
you still haven &apos;t canceled that yet ?
what part of &quot; let it go &quot; is confusing ? lap pads .
i guess there &apos;s still time .
this is gonna be a very long night
if you two keep hounding me about this .
wilson , don &apos;t you have anything to talk about ?
her engagement ring is still in the drawer in her bedside table .
engagement ... ring ?
steph , when was the last time you had sex ?
all right .
if you &apos;re gonna ditch the guy , you better do it soon .
god , will you shut it ?
you shut it .
both of you shut it . balfour .
and i have three children at home ,
so don &apos;t think for a second
i don &apos;t know you two are making faces right now .
settle in .
so , is there no directive in place ?
her fiance knows what she wants .
they spend their spare time dangling from cliffs .
of course they talked about it .
but he doesn &apos;t have any rights , legally .
he &apos;s not her husband .
just hoping to call it an early day
if we don &apos;t have to save this girl ?
guys . malleable .
it &apos;d be nice to know what the patient wants .
well , we don &apos;t , so maybe we don &apos;t just give up yet .
i never said anything about giving up .
guys , come on .
right angle .
here you go .
another .
where are we ?
should we scrub in ?
we just started the first lung .
you &apos;re early .
way early .
i &apos;d say she still has a few more hours , right ?
plenty of time for you to go take a shower ,
get a change of clothes , take a disco nap , groom .
cancel plans that aren &apos;t gonna happen .
or stay .
i mean , this is a triple organ transplant .
i wouldn &apos;t nap through this .
exactly . i &apos;m here . i might as well jump in .
go on . scoot .
you take some &quot; me &quot; time .
we will page you when you &apos;re up .
you are being ridiculous .
okay , would you stop ?
what ?
she needs this . this is good .
i know that .
so stop being the harbinger of doom about it .
stop being all &quot; whoo @-@ yay &quot; about it .
what are we talking about ?
you just stop .
alex , i have to be positive ,
because if i &apos;m not , you &apos;re gonna make her change her mind .
no , you are . trust me .
if she feels trapped , she &apos;s gonna bolt .
don &apos;t make a big deal out of this .
it &apos;s a big enough deal already .
i know it is .
you got to make her feel like she has an escape hatch
or she &apos;s gonna run for the hills .
yeah , she will if you don &apos;t shut your dumb mouth .
you &apos;re dumb .
go update kelsey &apos;s parents .
we figure five hours for the lungs ,
seven hours for the liver and the pancreas ,
so there &apos;s time .
for ?
edwards , where do we keep the razor kits ?
you know we have a shower , right ?
yeah . i &apos;m on a clock .
this is an emergency leg shave .
it &apos;s not a big deal . it &apos;s just drinks .
what are you gonna wear ?
uh , sports bra and granny panties , apparently ,
or whatever is in my locker from yesterday .
why am i even doing this ? this is just -- it &apos;s stupid .
you know , i brought a top with me today .
it &apos;s that one that you like .
it &apos;s the -- it &apos;s kind of see @-@ through , and some heels .
actually , they &apos;re your heels that i stole from you .
sorry .
you stole my shoes ?
the black ones you said
were too slutty for a mother of three .
plus , they pinch a little ,
but they are so worth it .
so worth it .
i &apos;ll leave everything out for you .
thank you .
you didn &apos;t have to do that .
i know .
hey , there you are .
um , i got a message from kayla &apos;s mom
about a sleepover with sofia next week ?
sure . yeah . it &apos;s fine with me .
okay , great .
is there something else ?
no .
no .
you sure ?
i , um ...
i did something bad , i think ...
when i was trying so hard to do something good .
i thought that i was --
i was being a good friend
and , i swear , i was .
i was -- i was right .
what was right ?
april &apos;s pregnant .
and she refused to tell jackson .
so ...
so i did .
what ?
and she &apos;s so angry with me right now .
well ...
i mean , i did the right thing , right ?
no , honey . no .
but he &apos;s the other parent .
if april &apos;s keeping things from him ...
still . still , no . ... - about the baby .
about the baby &apos;s future and the baby &apos;s health .
doesn &apos;t matter .
without him .
no , it still doesn &apos;t matter .
yes , it does .
no , arizona !
no . just no .
okay , so ...
what if it had been us ?
i mean , what if we &apos;d been trying ,
and then suddenly i was pregnant right
when we split up .
i mean , wouldn &apos;t you -- wouldn &apos;t you want to know that ?
well , yes . yes , of course .
but from you .
not from someone else .
i &apos;m sorry . you screwed this one up big time .
w @-@ why aren &apos;t you down there ?
i was on the procurement .
why aren &apos;t you down there ?
don &apos;t you have an all @-@ access or pass now ?
chief of cardio ?
so smart .
but a guy who looks like you can get anyone .
there &apos;s no way i &apos;m gonna land an attending .
a resident , maybe .
i mean , wilson is like ahhhhhh
but she &apos;s with karev .
blake likes ladies .
edwards maybe ,
she &apos;s hot and she &apos;s tight with shepherd ,
so that wouldn &apos;t hurt either .
do you think i have a chance there ?
no .
no .
well , i got to hand it to you , dude .
you should go .
&apos;cause i &apos;m about to nut punch you .
small intestine and right colon excised .
bring this to path , please .
she &apos;s gonna need a tpn when she &apos;s more stable .
dr. kepner . dr. avery &apos;s wondering how long you &apos;ll be .
tell him as long as i need to .
everything all right ?
i ...
it &apos;s fine .
medium clips .
april .
she said it was fine .
pressure &apos;s dropping again .
pupils are dilated . non @-@ responsive .
crap .
global ischemia from the hypotension ?
traumatic brain injury ?
what difference does it make ?
her brain &apos;s been deprived of oxygen .
there &apos;s no coming back from this point .
cabbage patch .
damn it .
blake , step in and finish creating the colostomy .
you comfortable with doing one ?
uh , yeah . sure .
then i &apos;d like you to close up the fascia with running pds .
me ? okay . why are you leaving ?
&apos;cause there &apos;s nothing left to do .
patient is too far gone .
but it &apos;s not every day you get to practice on living flesh ,
so perfect your colostomy technique .
i &apos;ll call shepherd for a neuro eval .
man , she &apos;s not getting off that vent .
so wrong . it &apos;s not fair .
i &apos;ll let you know when shepherd &apos;s done ,
then we can go talk to tess &apos; family .
robbins ? you told robbins and you didn &apos;t tell me ?
i don &apos;t -- i don &apos;t have time for this right now , okay ?
you &apos;ve taken more than enough time , don &apos;t you think ?
the time was before i signed the friggin &apos; divorce papers .
what &apos;s going on there ?
jackson . i &apos;m not doing this .
not here . not now .
well , excuse me .
is there a more convenient time for me to catch you lying to me ?
jackson !
you don &apos;t think a pregnancy
would have factored into my decision
to move forward with the divorce ?
i knew it would , but you didn &apos;t want to stay with me .
you think i want you to stay for my baby ...
our baby .
and have you hating me for the rest of my life ?
well , you got a pretty good jump on that , didn &apos;t you ?
wow . that -- yeah . that didn &apos;t take any time at all .
all right . that &apos;s enough .
no , you know what ? it &apos;s fine . screw this .
you want to play the martyr here ?
you want to pretend you &apos;re doing this alone ?
go for it .
knock yourself out .
it &apos;s your deal , april . you win .
i &apos;m out . i &apos;m done .
i said enough .
what are you doing here ? i told you i would page you .
there &apos;s still a ton of time before you need to be here .
i &apos;m here . let me help .
fine . jump in .
no . no . not fine . no jumping .
maggie , you got to let it go .
i can &apos;t let it go .
you told me your train had stopped running ,
and tonight , one is coming into the station ,
and that is a big deal .
i can &apos;t pretend like it &apos;s not .
wilson .
yes .
go the attendings lounge , get my phone ,
go into my contacts , find william thorpe ,
please text him and let him know
that tonight &apos;s plans have been canceled .
meredith , no ! wait , meredith --
my passcode is 1008 .
now it &apos;s really over . so let it go .
pickups .
see what you did ?
this is your fault .
please , i just -- i @-@ i just need a minute , okay ?
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
because , um , i @-@ i didn &apos;t want to tell anyone ...
especially you .
i didn &apos;t want you to -- i feel like i &apos;m just --
i &apos;m screwing everything up ,
and all i &apos;m trying to do is protect this baby
and it &apos;s -- it &apos;s all screwed up .
every-- everything is all screwed up .
april , april .
april , you &apos;re having a baby .
yeah .
it &apos;s not screwed up .
it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s a miracle .
yes , it is .
yes .
thank you .
bailey ?
can i ask you something ?
you just did .
well , um , i ...
i did something , and i don &apos;t --
yeah , i heard .
oh . well , great .
yeah , you shared confidential medical information
without permission ,
breaking multiple state and federal privacy laws .
you did it to a fellow doctor ,
under this roof , in my hospital .
speaking as your boss , that &apos;s a firing offense .
and speaking to me as my friend ?
i mean , i can see where you thought
you were doing what was right .
yes ! yes , i was .
that doesn &apos;t make it right .
yeah , i @-@ i @-@ i &apos;m fresh out of words of wisdom for you .
okay .
i got all day .
i told you it &apos;s not your business .
well , it is when you brawl on the o.r. floor of my hospital .
i don &apos;t need your help !
stop telling yourself that i need your help .
i don &apos;t . you &apos;re not my father .
i know i &apos;m not .
but who is ?
i don &apos;t see him around here , do you ?
that the man you want to be ?
you &apos;re having a child .
maybe it &apos;s not the way you wanted .
maybe it &apos;s not when .
all right , so you found out late .
i found out decades late .
what &apos;s important is now you know .
it &apos;s happening ...
and you need to step up .
that &apos;s what matters .
unfortunately , in surgery ,
we discovered your daughter &apos;s injuries
were more catastrophic than we realized
and her brain function has virtually ceased .
your daughter has virtually no brain activity .
i am so sorry .
oh , my god .
but i saw her .
her heart is pumping .
she &apos;s still breathing .
she &apos;s alive .
the ventilator is breathing for her .
she can &apos;t breathe on her own
or feed herself or use the bathroom .
she &apos;s using catheters and ostomies
and will likely need those indefinitely .
from this point on ,
she will require round @-@ the @-@ clock professional care ,
probably for the rest of her life .
or until she gets better .
i &apos;m sorry ?
she &apos;ll need the care until she gets better ,
until she wakes up - and she can leave the hospital .
do we know when that might be ?
when tess could leave here ?
eventually , she would be moved
to a long @-@ term acute care facility
where she would live for the rest of her --
well , we can -- we can get you some brochures
if that &apos;s what you decide .
or if you decide to withdraw care .
oh , tess .
i understand that this is difficult ,
and you should take some time to talk this over .
that won &apos;t be necessary .
we understand the circumstances .
we want you to do everything that you can to save our daughter .
no ! this is not what she &apos;d want .
she could wake up .
i mean , people wake up from comas all the time .
um , i &apos;m sorry , but in tess &apos; case , that &apos;s highly unlikely .
she told me what she wants . more than once .
please , she would not want to live like this .
what is wrong with you ?
this isn &apos;t your decision to make , michael .
if this had happened two months from now , it would be .
we would &apos;ve been married .
will you get him out of here ?
lines are out .
almost done ?
anastomoses look terrific on both sides .
no bleeding or leaks .
sats look great .
yeah , nice work .
well , uh , that does it for me ,
unless you need me to stay and help ... in any way .
i &apos;ll close . you can go .
scalpel .
so , what &apos;s wrong with the guy ?
huh ?
thorpe .
what &apos;s his deal ?
nothing . he &apos;s fine .
callie said he was a jerk that night at bauer .
that &apos;s not true .
said he almost killed the surgery .
scissors .
10 blade .
he was just trying to protect his patient .
so he was throwing a tantrum like a toddler .
shut up .
he &apos;s nice ... and he &apos;s funny .
mm , so he &apos;s just butt @-@ ugly .
yes . he is butt @-@ ugly .
yeah , well .
it &apos;s hard first time out after somebody important .
first girl after izzie left ? it was pretty messy .
you feel like you belong to somebody else ,
like you &apos;re cheating , you know ?
i mean , you &apos;re not , but man , sure feels that way .
i never had a wife die , but ...
i &apos;ve had a few &quot; first time afters , &quot; mer .
there &apos;s always something after ... eventually .
we lose people and then we find new ones .
it &apos;s how it works .
i guess .
oh , i know .
look , if you &apos;re not into him , who cares ?
but if you are , it &apos;s okay .
okay ?
okay .
plus , it &apos;s gonna be weird no matter what ,
so you might as well get it over with .
suction .
yeah , she should be awake soon .
looks like she &apos;s gonna make that big dance .
no more coughing and wheezing ?
well , the new organs don &apos;t carry the cf gene .
once she &apos;s off the vent ,
chances are good you &apos;ll never see her on one again .
thank you .
she &apos;s gonna stay on that ventilator ... forever ?
unless something changes , yes .
her parents will hate me forever
for taking her up that mountain .
she &apos;ll hate me - for bringing her back down .
this place looks nice .
lovely views .
and who knows ?
she could be up and walking again this time next year .
you never know .
don &apos;t give up hope , right ?
god bless you , dr. riggs .
&quot; don &apos;t give up hope , &quot; huh ?
well , that &apos;s all they have now , right ?
you changed your tune . you wanted to give up all day .
no , i did not . i wanted to do what the patient wanted .
oh , and you got to let this go .
oh , what &apos;s that ?
if you &apos;re still feeling guilty after all this time ,
that &apos;s your deal .
stop taking it out on me .
guilty ? what have i got to feel guilty about ?
oh , you think it &apos;s all my fault , but i never quit .
you did .
you let megan go .
you stopped looking .
i didn &apos;t . i stayed behind .
i stayed . i looked . i searched , and i prayed .
because you got her killed !
we don &apos;t know that . you decided it .
you made a decision that she was dead .
you came back here , you started over ,
and you forgot about her .
you shut your mouth .
that &apos;s why you hate that i &apos;m here ,
&apos;cause i remind you of what you did ,
that you gave up on her .
i swear to god --
people here don &apos;t even know you had a sister .
that &apos;s sick , mate .
you need to hate someone ?
look in a mirror .
you had a tough day .
you heard , too ?
i think everybody &apos;s heard by now .
right .
i don &apos;t know what to do .
i want to make it right .
i mean , i have to make it right somehow ,
but i don &apos;t know what to do .
i don &apos;t -- i don &apos;t know how to fix it .
you did something indefensible .
right .
so maybe , um ...
maybe i go to her again and apologize .
the only thing that you can do right now
is accept what you did was wrong .
and the only thing you can do to fix it is ...
to wait .
just give it time ...
... and maybe april will forgive you .
maybe she won &apos;t ...
but you -- that is not up to you .
how &apos;s the , uh , how &apos;s the transplant going ?
huge success . come on . i &apos;ll tell you all about it .
actually , um , i think i &apos;m gonna stay here tonight .
i got early rounds in the morning
and kind of want to just study .
come over . i &apos;ll help you study .
i don &apos;t want help .
okay .
i don &apos;t want special treatment ,
and i don &apos;t want to miss out on things ,
but that &apos;s already happening .
and i don &apos;t want to make awkward small talk with dr. webber .
you are the one - who wanted us to go public .
i know .
i know .
i &apos;m just gonna study , all right ?
okay .
i &apos;ll see you tomorrow .
uh , i &apos;m glad you called me back .
well , i shouldn &apos;t have . i &apos;m way too tired for drinks .
i just got out of a 17 @-@ hour surgery .
i probably shouldn &apos;t even drive home
until i &apos;ve crashed here for a while , so ...
so how about i take you home ?
um ... you &apos;re skipping a bunch of steps , don &apos;t you think ?
yeah , how about i give you a ride home
so that you can crash in your own bed ?
i don &apos;t mind .
look , i know what 17 hours straight feels like .
i &apos;m not worried about the drinks .
i &apos;ll take you out some other time .
hey ! happy birthday !
owen ! come on .
i &apos;m holding a box of creepy , squirming lobsters .
you gonna let me in ?
just a sec .
am i ... early ?
uh , no , no , no , no , no . we &apos;re all good .
i was just gonna -- uh , come in .
come on .
looks like you already started the party .
no , no . - i might &apos;ve screwed up a little .
i forgot that we were ...
i &apos;ll just put these in the fridge , i guess .
yes , i @-@ i @-@ i can put some water on .
it &apos;ll just take a minute to boil .
i ... had a long day ,
and riggs is ...
riggs is what ?
nothing , it &apos;s just --
don &apos;t listen to him .
let &apos;s try this another time .
no , no , no . no .
no , let &apos;s do it .
no , let &apos;s not , owen .
amelia . - i &apos;m just -- i &apos;m gonna go .
it &apos;s fine . i &apos;m fine .
amelia , don &apos;t go . i &apos;m sorry .
i just had a couple of beers .
who is it ?
it &apos;s me .
hey , i @-@ i just wanted to apologize .
i reacted badly today , and ...
we &apos;re having a baby ...
who does not deserve to have us arguing over it .
that &apos;s what i was trying to avoid .
i get that .
sort of . i mean , - i &apos;m -- i &apos;m trying to get that .
we can figure this out .
all right ?
yeah .
look , i just -- i honestly -- i didn &apos;t --
i waited to tell you because last time ...
... last time tore us apart .
literally .
neither one of us could help the other
and everyone got hurt , and i just didn &apos;t want that ...
for you or me .
i just -- i wanted to wait until i knew
that everything was okay ,
and i &apos;m -- i am -- i am really sorry .
okay ? i &apos;m sorry .
you wanted to wait until it was too late ?
right ? until you were too far along to do anything about it .
i &apos;m sorry . do what , exactly ?
i don &apos;t know -- - not put us through this again ,
or a baby , for that matter .
i mean , i &apos;d have to hold him while he dies .
maybe have some options .
um , that is not an option for me and you know that .
what about me ?
what about my option --
you don &apos;t count here .
i don-- i &apos;m the father .
yes , you are . yes .
you &apos;re the father when there &apos;s a baby .
but right now , you have no choice in this .
it &apos;s my body , my baby .
april .
you are not my husband .
you have no rights here .
it hurts to tear that bandage off .
we don &apos;t want to see what &apos;s underneath .
but maybe it &apos;s not the fear of the pain that holds us back .
i was worried about the duodenal segment getting ischemic .
mm . yeah , what &apos;d you do ?
mm . i placed stents at the sma
and the celiac anastomoses ,
just to be on the safe side .
smart .
ketchup ?
more ketchup ?
i love my ketchup .
i did a portal reconstruction once --
good guy , had no idea he drank a fifth a day
until i tried to cut into his liver .
you know , it &apos;s shoe leather .
that makes it so hard .
yeah .
napkin .
i almost stopped drinking right then .
almost .
yeah .
i don &apos;t want to see my liver .
i don &apos;t want to see it , either .
maybe we &apos;re really afraid
to see if the wound underneath is still open ...
i should go up .
yeah .
yeah , okay .
you know what i did do that was funny ?
i used an interposition aortic conduit
to supply the pancreatic graft .
huh . how did -- how did you do that ?
... or if it might actually be healing .
