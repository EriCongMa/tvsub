for over a century , i have lived in secret until now .
i know the risk .
but i have to know her .
elena-- she &apos;s a dead ringer for katherine .
our love for katherine wasn &apos;t real , damon .
i &apos;m gonna bring her back .
i &apos;m anna .
jeremy .
my great grandfather actually showed me a journal
and he had written all of this creepy stuff about vampires .
your turn . any sad relationship stories ?
fell in love , married young , wife died .
i &apos;ve never been in your room before .
elena ?
who am i to you ?
you are not katherine .
why do i look like her ?
you were adopted .
how you doin &apos; in there ?
stefan , who was that man in the road ?
i don &apos;t know . do you remember anything else about him ?
i wish . i never really saw his face .
he was wearing a hoodie .
all i can remember is that there was these black boots coming towards me .
i brought some vervain
for , um-- for you and jenna .
and , um , i made this bracelet for jeremy ,
few extra ones for friends .
you can put it in jewelry , or you can even put it
in food or drink ,
but as long as it &apos;s in you or on you ,
a vampire cannot control you .
well , so much to remember .
i know , but there &apos;s another vampire in town .
so until we find out who it is , what he wants ,
we have to be careful .
it &apos;s gonna be $ 22 .
elena , i need the money !
uh , here . come in . just put it on the table .
keep the change .
thanks .
and you have yourself a good night .
what are you looking for , damon .
that is my concern .
no , but putting elena in harm &apos;s way ,
that is my concern .
what are you talking about ?
i &apos;m talking about aatlanta .
oh , yeah . elena and i had a blast .
i get it .
you &apos;re just bitter because one of us
gets to be with the person that we love ,
and poor katherine is just out of reach .
i guess there isn &apos;t another way to get to that tomb .
is that what bree said ?
you &apos;re pathetic when you &apos;re fishing .
you &apos;re transparent when you &apos;re deflecting .
don &apos;t you have school ?
surprised ? it &apos;s a good essay .
your thoughts are clear , and your argument is well laid out
it &apos;s just uh ... you don &apos;t actually
think there are vampires in mystic falls .
no . i mean , i think statistically there &apos;s been
more animal attacks , mysterious deaths , uh ,
people gone missing , more than any other place
in the whole commonwealth of virginia .
it &apos;s conjecture ,
but creative , which is why you got the &quot; a. &quot;
i just wouldn &apos;t get too ,
caught up in the whole conspiracy theory of it all .
ah , i won &apos;t .
oh , uh , jeremy ,
the source that you cited
for the 1860s info , uh , jonathan gilbert ...
uh , my ancestor &apos;s journal ?
i &apos;d really like to see it sometime .
really ?
a first @-@ person account
of the civil war ? that &apos;s like , uh ,
porn for a history teacher .
you think my essay is creative ,
wait till you get a load of this thing .
thank you .
it &apos;s so pretty .
thank you .
god , it &apos;ll go with , like , everything .
what &apos;s the occasion ?
no occasion . just a little friend gift .
lesbian friend necklace ?
&apos;cause we &apos;re freaky like that ?
your friendship is important to me .
why are you being so mushy ?
because you &apos;ve been avoiding me ,
and i wanted you to know that whatever
is going on with you and matt , it &apos;s ok .
i was gonna talk to you about that .
i was , but there &apos;s just not much to say .
we &apos;ve hung out a couple times .
that &apos;s it , but ...
i just feel like we &apos;ve peaked as friends .
this is weird .
i shouldn &apos;t be talking to you about this .
it &apos;s weird . it &apos;s weird , right ?
it &apos;s a little weird , but ...
if it &apos;s what you and matt want ,
then it &apos;s not about me .
matt &apos;s not over you , and we all know it .
i &apos;m with stefan now .
matt understands that .
he knows he has to move on .
matt donovan . what do you know ?
ben mckittrick . what &apos;s up , man ?
rough season , bud .
yeah . it &apos;s kind of hard to recover
when you have to forfeit half your games .
you gonna be workin &apos; here ?
yep , followin &apos; in your footsteps ,
minus the states championship .
well , can &apos;t all be football gods .
yeah .
so what &apos;s the plan ? cook line ?
busboy .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re adopted .
i never saw that coming , and it gets weirder .
i looked at my birth certificate .
it lists miranda and grayson gilbert as my birthparents .
none of them makes any sense .
which is why you should ask jenna .
first of all , elena
i know we would always want the real truth , good or bad .
and second of all ?
you just found out your boyfriend is a vampire ,
so unless your birthparents are aliens ...
how bad could it be ?
ah , ok , look , i have to go to the store .
my outfit for the dance is severely lacking accessories .
all right . i &apos;ll pay the bill .
ok . bye .
bye .
what do you want from me ?
i think we need a fresh start .
you tried to kill me .
but i didn &apos;t , and if i wanted to , i would have .
does that not count for anything ?
you know , i can start fires with my mind .
fires kill vampires , right ?
just stay the hell away from me .
everything ok over here ?
yeah , we &apos;re fine .
i wasn &apos;t talkin &apos; to you .
thank you .
any time , bonnie .
wait . you remember me ?
i didn &apos;t graduate that long ago .
you &apos;re makin &apos; me feel old .
sorry . i didn &apos;t--
i didn &apos;t mean that . i just--
i didn &apos;t know you knew me .
i always know a pretty face .
hello .
hello , elena .
hey , who &apos;s this ?
you hit me with your car .
is that a new one ?
you got away from me .
you won &apos;t next time .
why me ? what does he want with me ,
a @-@ and if he &apos;s trying to kill me ,
then why call first ?
that &apos;s because we &apos;re predators , elena .
we hunt . we stalk .
it &apos;s often as exciting as the kill .
i want you to take this .
this is jeremy &apos;s pocket watch .
how did you get it ?
i took it from damon , who took it from logan ,
who must have taken it from you .
what happened to it ?
well , it &apos;s n just a watch .
it &apos;s a-- it &apos;s a sort of compass ,
but it points to vampires .
why did my father have it ?
gilberts were one of the founding families ,
and back in 1864 , they were among those
who sought to eradicate the vampires .
the compass was used to find us .
did you know them ?
yes .
i want you to keep this . that way ,
you &apos;ll know if you &apos;re ever in danger .
i &apos;ve nevereen you such a mess .
don &apos;t talk smack .
i mean , i just thought that you told everyone else what to do .
well , i do that , too ,
but if you want something done right ,
you gotta do it yourself .
you know , i just like that we &apos;re hanging out .
who knew--you and me ?
well , who knew you could be fun ?
so what are you wearing to this dumb dance , anyway ?
should we color @-@ coordinate ?
uh , i &apos;m not goin &apos; .
why not ?
i gotta work , bussin &apos; tables at the grill .
since when are you a busboy ?
it &apos;s a job .
you know , some of us have to work , caroline .
with our mom in and out , things are tight , so ...
i didn &apos;t mean it like that .
i just meant that i didn &apos;t know you had a job .
well , i do .
i gotta go .
how &apos;d it go ?
what ?
the paper .
oh . i got an &quot; a . &quot;
thanks for the artles . they really helped .
cool . so what &apos;d he say about the vampir ?
did he believe it ?
i don &apos;t even believe it . it &apos;s just a paper , anna .
anyways , i , uh-- i gotta get goin &apos; .
d @-@ do you wanna do something later , maybe ?
uh , sorry . i &apos;m stuck on punch duty at the school dance .
oh . how &apos;d you get stuck with that ?
well , i &apos;m failin &apos; english , so i copped a plea .
so , maybe , you know , tomorrow or something .
i &apos;m being pushy again , aren &apos;t i ?
well , thanks for the help . i &apos;ll--
i &apos;ll see you around .
spoke to the insurance company .
car &apos;s totaled .
you can keep using mine for now .
so you &apos;re coming to the dance ?
alaric askede to help chaperone .
why didn &apos;t you tell me , jenna ?
your mom was gonna do it eventually .
i never thought i &apos;d have to .
if my mom were here right now
and i asked , she &apos;d tell me the truth .
your dad was about to leave the office one night
when this girl showed up .
she was 16 , a runaway , and about to give birth .
he delivered her baby , and he gave her a place to stay ,
but a few days later , she disappeared .
and there you were .
your parents were trying so hard to have a baby .
i @-@ it just wasn &apos;t happening .
all miranda ever wanted was to be a mom .
why were my parents &apos; names on the birth certicate ?
your dad was a doctor , elena .
he took care of it .
they didn &apos;t wanna lose you , so they kept it quiet ,
told as few people as possible ,
but if anyone ever wanted proof , they had documtation .
what else do you know about her ?
the girl .
just her name .
isabelle .
you got the hair right .
why are you bringing me dad &apos;s journal ?
&apos;cause you were looking for it .
and why would i want it ?
gee , i don &apos;t know , damon .
maybe you wanna do a little bit of posthumous bonding .
go ahead . enjoy it . read it .
i have . nowhere in it does it say anything about katherine
or the tomb or how to open it .
i &apos;m not surprised .
man could barely spell his own name .
i &apos;m really sorry
that it won &apos;t be of any help with your diabolical plan ,
the sequel .
you know , i could help you .
you , help me ?
aw , i don &apos;t know .
seems a little unnatural .
i &apos;ll do anything to get you out of this town ,
even release katherine .
what about the other 26 vampires ?
no , no , no . they can &apos;t come .
they have to stay put , but katherine ,
i would consider that .
what are you doin &apos; ? hmm ?
what &apos;s your angle ?
think about it .
why would i trust you ?
see that &apos;s your problem , damon .
you apply all of your shortcomings to everybody else .
if history &apos;s any indication ,
there &apos;s only one liar among us .
hey , jenna .
jenna ?
jeremy ?
stefan &apos;s phone . how may i help you ?
where is he ?
he &apos;s on his way to you ,
forgotis phone .
thank god . this compass was spinning .
stefan must be here . thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
are you ok ?
are you ok ?
ok .
how did he get in ?
he was invited in .
he posed as a pizza delivery guy last night .
well , he gets points for that .
did he say what he wanted ?
no . he was too busy trying to kill me .
and you have no idea who this is ?
no .
don &apos;t look at me like that .
i told you we had company .
you think there &apos;s more than one ?
we don &apos;t know .
damon , he was invited in .
then we go get him tonight .
you up for it ?
what do i have to do ?
let your boyfriend take you to the dance hall .
we &apos;ll see who shows up .
that &apos;s a bad idea .
till we get him , this house isn &apos;t safe .
for anyone who lives in it .
it &apos;s worth a shot .
i &apos;ll do it .
i &apos;ll be with the two of you . i &apos;ll be safe .
alaric .
hey , look at you .
i figured i &apos;d stand out less if i dressed up .
heh heh . liar .
ok , i &apos;m a sucker for the decade dance .
i went to school here , you know .
they do the sixts and seventies , too , fyi .
oh . can &apos;t wait .
can i get you a drink ?
i hear the punch is real boss .
having fun ?
no , but this took about 2 hours ,
so i &apos;m at least staying half of that .
what &apos;s damon doing here ?
he wanted to come .
i promise . he &apos;ll behave .
so what is this , like , a threesome now ,
you and the salvatore brothers ?
no , but if i &apos;m gonna be with stefan ,
then i have to learn to tolerate damon .
it &apos;s not like i can kill him .
there &apos;s a thought .
i &apos;ll help .
i &apos;m really starting to see a change in jeremy , finally .
uh , losing someone you love so suddenly ,
the , uh--the trauma and the grief ther
are some of the tougher things he &apos;ll face in life .
from someone who knows .
you have no idea what happened ?
that &apos;s the hard part , not knowing .
is it ok to talk about your wife ?
heh . there &apos;s not much to talk about .
that must be impossible to deal with , not having any answers .
i &apos;d be lying to you if i told you
it didn &apos;t keep me up at night .
wondering why , by who ,
maybe one day .
hope so .
hope so .
hi , bonnie .
wanna dance ?
i &apos;m out of here .
please give me another chance .
back off , damon .
where did they go ?
i don &apos;t know .
what &apos;d you say to &apos; em ?
i was perfectly polite .
elena ...
would you like to dance ?
i would love to .
may i have us dance ?
shouldn &apos;t you guys be able to sense each other or something ?
no . doesn &apos;t work that way .
see him anywhere ?
not unless he has a pompadour .
wow . was not one of the better fashion trends .
come on . i &apos;m sure you looked great back then .
are there pictures ?
no . burned . buried .
seriously , what was it like , the fifties ?
because in my mind , i have this picture of somewhere
between &quot; american bandstand , &quot; &quot; grease . &quot;
it &apos;s all varsity sweaters and milkshakes .
well , that and , you know , mccarthyism
and segregation and nuclear arms race .
ok , but there were poodle skirts .
there were poodle skirts .
you &apos;re so teaching me how to do the hand jive .
no . that &apos;s not gonna happen .
you neglected to mention this was a theme party .
what are you doing here ?
well , seeing as you also neglected to invite me ,
i took matters into my own hands .
you &apos;re doing that thing again .
what thing would that be ?
that thing where you pretend we &apos;re dating ,
even though we &apos;re not .
oh , you mean stalking . yeah .
heh . get over yourself .
come on . i &apos;ve never been to a school dance before .
humor me .
let &apos;s sit up there .
be a little more obvious , bonnie .
don &apos;t rain on my hot @-@ guy parade .
what ? it &apos;s just a drizzle .
ben mckittrick ? really ?
he &apos;s hot .
he &apos;s a washed @-@ up jock
who pours drinks for a living .
you could do way better .
hey .
what &apos;s up ?
yeah , i don &apos;t recognize you .
how &apos;d you get roped into chaperoning ?
alaric saltzman .
i &apos;m the new history teacher .
ah , the , uh , cursed faculty position .
so i &apos;ve been told .
damon . salvatore .
salvatore , as in , uh , stefan ?
he &apos;s my little brother
i &apos;m his legal guardian , hence the chaperoning .
i hear he &apos;s very bright ,
not that i &apos;ve had a chance to see for myself .
well , his attendance record &apos;s a little spotty .
family drama .
no parents ?
mm , it &apos;s just the two of us now .
you , uh--you live here your whole life ?
on and off . travel a bit .
really ? where ?
around the states ?
heh . i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m nosy . i--i don &apos;t mean to pry .
look , it was nice meeting you .
you , too .
enjoy the rest of the dance .
tonight was so much better on paper .
ah , you &apos;re just feeling sorry for yourself .
go and talk to him .
be bold and fearless .
yeah , this coming from the girl who &apos;s
been eye stalking the bartender .
you &apos;re right .
hi .
twice in one day .
lucky me .
i &apos;m proving something to my friend .
oh , yeah ? what &apos;s that ?
that you don &apos;t have to sit around
and wait for a guy to come up to you .
does that mean that you &apos;re asking me out on a date ?
does that mean you want me to ?
well , what did you have in mind ?
do you like karaoke ?
no .
but i would really like to go on a date with you .
seriously ?
is that for me ?
do you see anyone else in the vicinity ?
do you need something ?
are you mad at me or something ?
no , care . i &apos;m not mad . i--
well , then why are you being so weird ?
i &apos;m not . i &apos;m working .
you &apos;re avoiding .
no . i have a table to clean .
you know , that &apos;s the kind of thing
that washed @-@ up jocks do to make a living .
you don &apos;t go to school here .
you know , you don &apos;t have to help .
oh , i don &apos;t mind .
it &apos;s fun .
oh , um , yeah . before i forget ,
can i borrow your anctor &apos;s journal ?
why ?
you said i could read it .
uh , i don &apos;t have it .
oh , obviously you didn &apos;t bring it here ,
uh , but i can walk you home .
no . i mean , i gave it to my history teacher .
wait . why did you give it to him ?
because he wanted to read it .
you know , you shouldn &apos;t be giving that to just anybody .
but i should give it to you ?
loan . loan it to me .
well , i loaned it to mr.saltzman.
maybe he &apos;s in his classroom . we can get it back .
what &apos;s the big deal with the stupid journal ?
your eye .
um , there &apos;s something in it .
forget it . i gotta go .
maybe he &apos;s not gonna show .
you mean we did all this dancing for nothing ?
ahh . the horror .
i &apos;m really sorry for all this .
it &apos;s my choice .
i decided to be here .
i officially signed up for it ,
so i don &apos;t wanna hear you apologizing anymore .
show me how it &apos;s done in the fifties .
uh , no .
come on . one move ?
now you remember that ,
because it &apos;s never gonna happen again .
what a you doin &apos; here ?
trying to get the journal , as in sticking to the plan ,
something you &apos;re not doing .
leave the girl alone .
i like her .
she looks like katherine .
she &apos;s not katherine .
ok , katherine is in the tomb .
i know , but until we open that tomb ,
i got her to play with .
don &apos;t be stupid .
that girl is with the salvatore brothers .
they don &apos;t scare me . they never have .
please , no . don &apos;t do this .
you &apos;re gonna ruin everything .
you got noth &apos; to worry about .
i &apos;m not gonna let anything happen to you .
you will get what you came for .
just let me have my fun .
she looks like katherine .
you really can &apos;t take him anywhere , can you ?
uh , no .
stefan ,
the back corner .
get damon .
what did i do ?
where is he ?
i was getting a soda ,
and then this guy gave me his hoodie .
hello , elena .
here &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do .
there &apos;s an exit door behind you .
you have 5 seconds .
no .
or your brother dies .
i can snap his neck so fast . i bet there &apos;s not even a witness .
start walking .
don &apos;t you dare touch him .
keep walking .
through the door .
hey , dickhead .
nobody wants to kill you . just wanna talk .
now you feel like talkin &apos; ?
screw you .
wrong answer .
why are you doing this ?
because it &apos;s fun .
what do you want with elena ?
she looks like katherine .
you know katherine ?
you thought you were the only ones .
you don &apos;t even remember me .
tell me how to get in the tomb . hmm ?
no .
the grimoire .
where is it ?
check the journal . the journal .
in jonathan &apos;s journal .
jonathan gilbert &apos;s .
who else is working with you ?
who else is there ?
no . you gonna have to kill me .
what do we--how are you gonna find the others now ?
he had to die .
but ...
elena , he &apos;s been invited in .
go . i got this .
what were you doing ?
looking for ms. hilden .
why are you in mystic falls ?
i got a job as a teacher .
do you know what i am ?
you &apos;re my student &apos;s brother .
is everything you &apos;re telling me the truth ?
yes .
then forget we had this conversation .
there &apos;s no way that idiot was workin &apos; alone .
you are .
so the grimoire ...
that was emily &apos;s , right ?
that &apos;s what you need to reverse the spell .
when the founding families burned her ,
they took her things ,
and you were hoping that
dad &apos;s journal would tell you where it is .
look at you puttin &apos; the pieces together .
good for you .
i was half @-@ right .
well , it &apos;s out there now .
let the games begin .
my offer still stands .
yeah , with some hidden caveats , no doubt .
no . nothing hidden about it .
no lies . no deception .
i &apos;m there when you open up that tomb ,
you and katherine go ,
and the other 26 vampires die .
if i agree .
i &apos;ll help you .
why should i trust you ?
because i &apos;m your brother .
no , that &apos;s not gonna cut it .
because i want you gone .
ok .
look , i said something stupid .
i &apos;m sorry , but i wasn &apos;t even talking about you .
yes , you were , caroline .
ben could easily be me .
we &apos;re just alike .
that &apos;s not true .
are you seriouly mad about this ?
matt , you know me .
ok , i say stupid things without thinking ,
and then i have to apologize and take it back , and ...
i &apos;m a terrible , awful person ,
but i &apos;m working on it .
look , can we just not do this right now ?
ok .
when do you get off ?
look , this thing we &apos;ve got ,
it &apos;s nice , and it feels really good ,
and i know you wanna take the next step .
how do you know that ?
have you even asked me ?
i &apos;m--i &apos;m not over elena .
i mean , i don &apos;t know if i am ,
but if we go there ,
then it could mess things up ,
and we might lose this ,
and this is the only good thing
i &apos;ve got going for me right now .
so if it doesn &apos;t work , i &apos;ll just disappoint you
and hurt you , and i don &apos;t wanna do that .
well , big problem , matt ,
because you took the next step all by yourself ,
and you played the whole thing out in your head ,
and you decided to bail before even giving it a shot .
so this really great thing that we have ,
don &apos;t worry about losing it ,
&apos;cause it &apos;s already gone .
thank you .
i needed that .
well , thank you for--for coming .
i--i really appreciate it .
you made the evening much more ...
well , you made it , period .
i &apos;m glad i could help .
and thank you for putting up with all that wife talk .
i--i gotta stop doing that .
it doesn &apos;t bode well for dating .
is that what this was , a date ?
no , definitely not a date .
but friday ...
you , me , and dinner and a movie ,
that could be a date .
how &apos; bout it ?
works for me .
uh , you can talk about your wife all you want .
it &apos;s gonna take time to heal .
we should just be ourselves .
still , i think i &apos;ll keep the isabelle talk to a minimum .
isabelle ?
yeah . that was her name .
where was isabelle from ?
virginia . i mean , not too @-@ not too far from here , actually .
caroline !
care , get in the truck .
what ?
this &apos;ll never work .
doing ok ?
is it weird if i say yes ?
is it true ?
i should feel more upset
or scared or something , but i ...
feel kind of exhilarated .
it &apos;s the adrenaline .
you &apos;ll crash soon enough .
yeah , i guess .
i fought back tonight .
it felt good .
i wish you didn &apos;t have to fight at all .
still ...
i need to tell you something ,
and i don &apos;t know how you &apos;re gonna feel about it .
what ?
i told damon that i &apos;d help him get into that tomb
to get katherine back .
but it was a lie .
i let him believe that he could trust me .
well , then why would you be worried about telling me ?
because he can be very persuasive ,
and you two have bonded lately .
that doesn &apos;t mean i trust him .
it &apos;s gonna take a lot more than just a road trip and a rescue
for me to forget who damon is and everytng he &apos;s done .
i don &apos;t wanna be his enemy , elena ,
but i can &apos;t let him do it .
then don &apos;t ,
and i &apos;ll help you , whatever it takes .
ok ?
ok .
come here .
don &apos;t sneak up on me .
you love it .
where &apos;s noah ?
his obsession got the best of him ,
and so did the salvatore brothers .
they killed him ?
tortured and staked .
you &apos;re not very upset .
i warned him , ben ,
and he was just gonna screw everything up anyway .
let &apos;s be honest . he wasn &apos;t exactly asset .
how &apos;d you do ?
oh , the witch is totally crushing on me .
did you get the journal ?
