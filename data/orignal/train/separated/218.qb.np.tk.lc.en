gossip girl here--
your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
serena , that video wasn &apos;t real .
i mean , we did--we did kiss , but it was staged .
what about the other time you guys kissed ?
was that for louis , too ?
it meant nothing .
i &apos;m really glad you two found each other ,
because you sure lost me .
wait . vanessa told her about the kiss , not chuck ?
just to be clear , we are not friends anymore .
all i know about my mom is that her name is avery thorpe .
do you think this will be enough
for the private investigator to find her ?
this one is from 8 : 00 p.m. the night of the fire .
what &apos;s on it ?
bart having an argument with a woman--avery thorpe .
moments later , the building goes up in flames ,
and avery thorpe is never heard from again .
but being together means going against my family .
if i &apos;m going to take a stand , i need to know for certain
that you feel as i do .
i do .
mom ,
i &apos;m sorry to wake you ,
but i have some news .
once upon a time in the land called upper east ,
a beautiful girl met a beast .
andrew , i was thinking ,
that video is circumstantial at best .
my father may have been a coldhearted businessman ,
but he wasn &apos;t a cold @-@ blooded murderer .
there &apos;s no proof the fire was intentional .
let &apos;s just drop it .
sorry i ever asked .
thanks .
but while the beast locked himself in a tower of ennui ,
the girl found herself a prince . his name ...
louis !
no , no way . i @-@ i @-@ i will defend new york city to the death ,
but you cannot seriously say
you prefer the met to the louvre .
but i do . i will trade all
the delacroix and davids
for just an hour in front
of that kiefer on the second floor .
our first disagreement .
but , um , i must be off .
no . oh , i won &apos;t let you go .
blair , it &apos;s 2 : 00 p.m.
i &apos;ve been here since yesterday .
and as amazing as last night was ,
i need to talk to the ambassador .
it will just be a few hours .
a few hours is too long .
we &apos;re gonna spend the rest of the afternoon together .
and later we &apos;ll have tea in my salon at the consulate .
there &apos;s something i want to talk to you about .
well , can we talk about it now ?
and bonjour .
hey , serena .
i thought you were sleeping at your mother &apos;s house .
i did , and as it &apos;s 2 : 00,
i started my day several hours ago .
sorry i interrupted .
actually , i must be going . i will see you later .
je t &apos;adore .
oh . if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
there &apos;s a tart in my room i &apos;d rather attend to .
blair , this fight between us
has gotten a little out of hand ,
so why don &apos;t i be the mature one and admit that i may have
overreacted about you and dan ?
really ?
yeah , so let &apos;s just put this all behind us
so we can gush about louis already .
oh , yes ! thank goodness , because all this elation was
nearly meaningless without being able to talk to you about it .
louis is fantastique .
we share all our secrets and--
and our dreams for the future--
how he plans to run his kingdom , how i plan to run mine .
sounds like everything you &apos;ve ever wanted .
i &apos;m in , s. i &apos;m totally in .
i think he &apos;s gonna ask me
to spend the summer with him in monaco .
i worry she moving too fast .
ugh . dorota , everyone knows that with princes ,
things escalate quickly . it &apos;s genetic .
after all , prince charming knew he loved cinderella
as soon as he saw her preternaturally tiny feet .
and what about louis &apos; parents ?
after the lengths he went to to hide your date last week ,
how are they taking all the press coverage
about him dating an american ?
prince albert has no legitimate children ,
so as his first male nephew ,
louis is next in line to the throne .
i &apos;m sure his parents have their heart set
on an empire @-@ expanding union with a hapless hapsburg .
but luckily they &apos;re in botswana .
they won &apos;t be back for two weeks , during which time ,
the european media will fall in love with me
and win the commoners to my cause .
yesterday she watch monaco play p.s.g.
at actual sports bar .
ah . this afternoon , we &apos;re going to church
so i can be photographed being pious .
i must find my pillbox hat . je suis tr√®s heureux .
you so deserve it .
too bad that around here , happy endings often lack ,
so if i were b , i &apos;d watch my back .
well , hello , jeeves .
we &apos;re watching &quot; downton abbey . &quot;
edwardian social dramas apparently demand crumpets .
nice to see she &apos;s finally accepting
this whole house arrest thing .
between you and me , no matter how much they love each other ,
no two people should spend 24 / 7 together .
but my time as a drawing room butler
might be quickly coming to an end .
this guy from my old label was wondering
if i was into producing a record
for a new indie band he just signed , so i don &apos;t know .
you don &apos;t know what ? that sounds like an amazing opportunity .
it does , doesn &apos;t it ? i mean , i @-@ i don &apos;t need to be back onstage ,
but i do miss the music world .
in fact i &apos;m meeting the rest in half an hour .
so , uh , you &apos;ll understand if i can &apos;t hang out .
oh , i &apos;m here picking up charlie anyway .
charlie ? huh . you guys have been spending a lot of time together lately .
what ? dad , don &apos;t worry . we are just friends .
just be careful .
dan , hi .
good luck . i &apos;ll see you later .
4 : 00 .
smoking jacket hour , man .
why are you still in your robe ? is everything okay ?
peachy .
oh , come on , chuck . i know you &apos;ve seen the papers .
blair &apos;s dating that prince guy . can &apos;t be easy .
nathaniel , i wish my problems
were as simple as blair &apos;s royal fling .
have you heard from andrew ?
is there proof that what russell said about your dad is true ?
nothing concrete .
well , that &apos;s better than the opposite , right ?
&apos;cause raina &apos;s decided she wants to keep looking for her mother .
i &apos;d really rather she didn &apos;t .
come on , chuck . it &apos;s important to her ,
and me avoiding the subject is starting to come between us .
nate , raina can &apos;t go digging into the past .
as my friend , i need you to help me get this done .
i &apos;ll do my best .
hey , don &apos;t worry .
blair &apos;s not gonna end up with this guy .
we all know it .
your anthropology class is so cool .
it &apos;s just so interesting how the ... ! kung tribe
treated their women as hunting heroes
while the men , they just ...
i &apos;m--i &apos;m babbling , aren &apos;t i ?
no . well , yeah , you are ,
but enthusiasm is great .
sorry .
it &apos;s just , the classes i took at school
were boring and full of meatheads .
that seminar was fascinating . the kids were cool .
so ... thank you for ... inviting me .
uh , sure . you &apos;re welcome .
you wanna split a cab ?
uh , no , i &apos;m gonna hang around here .
i &apos;m gonna look for books on the .. ! kung tribe .
all right .
i &apos;ll see you later .
do you think i made a good impression on the monsignor today ?
you were ... irresistible .
he &apos;s probably second @-@ guessing his vows right now .
but , blair , i don &apos;t want you to continue this constant charade
for my parents . i want you to be you .
and i want to be with you .
the threat of your parents &apos; disapproval is the only dark cloud on
what has been an otherwise perfect day .
they shouldn &apos;t worry you ,
certainly not while they &apos;re on a safari .
but i do need to tell you something .
i @-@ i didn &apos;t tell you before because i didn &apos;t wanna scare you away .
it--it may be too much .
too much is just the right amount .
is it something i need a bikini for ?
louis . qu &apos;est que tu fais ?
maman ? what--what are you ...
uh , your royal highness , hello .
i &apos;m ... blair ... waldorf .
what are you thinking ?
out day and night with an american ,
getting your picture taken ?
uh , i @-@ i can explain .
it is unacceptable in any case ,
especially for a young man who is about to be married .
blair , please . please , let me explain .
i should have known not to believe .
and in all princess tales , an evil queen does appear .
i found them .
thank you so much for notifying me of this fiasco .
you &apos;re most welcome .
but it turns out ,
the queen &apos;s helper is the one b. should fear .
maybe you hear wrong . maybe she say &quot; carried . &quot;
maybe he getting carried .
that doesn &apos;t even make sense . i trusted him .
i allowed myself to feel things for him
that i &apos;ve only felt for you @-@ know @-@ who , and he lied .
a big , terrible , upper east @-@ sized lie .
where he staying ?
royal or no , vanya go over there ,
do some damage , eastern european style .
maybe i do damage myself .
seriously ? you think flowers make up
for the fact that you &apos;re engaged ?
i &apos;m not engaged yet . this is what i wanted to tell you .
the royal court feels i should be married
before taking my rightful place as albert &apos;s heir .
what ? well , that &apos;s outdated and old @-@ fashioned and just idiotic .
well , so is monarchy ,
but it &apos;s important to my family .
and they &apos;re important to me ,
so ...
how long till you have to choose ?
to punish me for publicly dating you ?
maman has flown in her top ten candidates
for a cocktail party tomorrow ,
and they &apos;re demanding i choose .
so by tomorrow night , you &apos;ll be engaged to someone else .
i &apos;ve been to a million balls and ski trips
with the women who will be there tomorrow night .
but i &apos;ve never connected to any of them like i have to you .
what are you saying ?
that i want you to be on my mother &apos;s list , too .
and ... i @-@ if i was chosen ?
we could ... court while wearing rings .
well , in real life ,
it &apos;s far too soon to consider that type of thing .
but in fairy tales ...
just tell this maiden what she has to do to get to the ball .
i told my mother i &apos;d agree to go to her party
if she agreed to meet you .
she &apos;s waiting for you back at the salon .
if she approves , all you have to do
is impress the royal court tomorrow .
well , then i promise to wow the tiara right off her head .
wow , b , courting with rings .
oh , no , no , no . don &apos;t be nervous .
the princess will fall in love with you
just like everyone else .
bye .
i recognize that happiness .
you sound like jenny after she found out
that one of her minions got a date with an astor .
next day , said minion found gum in her hair .
what &apos;s going on with you and blair ?
mm , i may have let louis &apos; mother know about him and blair .
but somehow it worked out to her favor .
apparently , louis needs to get married ,
and blair &apos;s weaseling her way onto a throne of her own
unless i stop it .
serena , she &apos;s your best friend .
i know she crossed sacred territory
when she kissed dan , but destroying this for her
seems kinda cruel .
oh , come on . we both know that
if i kissed chuck , i wouldn &apos;t
even be able to be having this conversation right now .
and i &apos;m doing louis a favor anyway .
his future is on the line here ,
and blair is just playing princess .
so this is all for the benefit
of the good people of the principality of monaco ?
come on . acting like blair
never works for anybody except blair .
and besides , blair has so many skeletons .
i highly doubt that louis &apos; mother is gonna
find her an acceptable princess @-@ in @-@ training .
yeah . yeah , you &apos;re right .
i have to go .
she says sneakily .
oh , looks like b is in for some hair gum of her own .
as so even though the division &apos;s getting tougher and tougher ,
the mets--they actually have a chance this year .
we gotta go .
the infield fly rule &apos;s so much easier to explain in person .
nate , what &apos;s going on ?
you surprise me with this dinner ,
and all you talk about is sports ?
what ? the season just started .
spring fever is an actual disease , you know ?
it feels like ever since that failed attempt
to meet my mother , you &apos;ve been avoiding talking about it--her .
i got to admit ,
i didn &apos;t think you &apos;d scare so easy .
raina , i didn &apos;t mean ...
look , i &apos;m not scared , okay ?
i wanna be supportive .
then what is it ?
it &apos;s just ...
i think some things are better left un @-@ found .
you know ?
and i don &apos;t want you to get hurt .
my mother is a part of who i am .
i need to know why she left ,
what happened to her . so i don &apos;t need you
or anyone else trying to protect me from the truth .
raina , i--
thank you for dinner , nate ,
but i have some work i need to catch up on back at the office .
dad , why are you dressed like the fonz ?
it &apos;s my lucky tour jacket .
i take it lunch with the label went well ?
yeah . they want me to have panic--
name of the band , also what &apos;s gripping my insides--
over for dinner tomorrow .
and you wanna be the , uh , cool rocker guy .
come on . i was the cool rocker guy .
yeah , but now the penthouse , the art ,
the millionairess wife under house arrest
doesn &apos;t exactly scream street cred .
oh , i wouldn &apos;t have put it that way , but ...
panic is the real deal .
so invite &apos; em to the loft tomorrow . you can , uh ,
you can keep it casual ,
impress &apos; em with your gold records .
yeah , that &apos;s a great idea . will you guys come ?
yeah , we could invite , uh , charlie , too .
no , no , not charlie . no . you were right , dad .
i think she might have a little crush .
i knew it .
yeah , but i didn &apos;t lead her on , though . i swear .
just promise me the next time you see her ,
you &apos;ll be clear about your feelings .
she lives under my roof , and i &apos;m responsible for her .
she texted me she &apos;ll be home soon .
and i promise i will talk to her soon as i get a chance ,
but i have a ... study group i gotta get to .
guys , don &apos;t worry . it &apos;s fine .
&quot; how to go from just friends to boyfriend ? &quot;
interesting .
charlie , hi .
we haven &apos;t formally met . i &apos;m vanessa .
oh , right . dan &apos;s former b.f.f.
who ratted out the blair kiss to serena .
what do you want ?
i realize that lately
i &apos;ve exposed more secrets than julian assange ,
but i &apos;m leaving soon .
i got a scholarship to study abroad .
so come the end of this semester ,
i &apos;ll be out of everyone &apos;s hair .
look , even if he hates me right now ,
dan &apos;s been my best friend since third grade ,
and i can &apos;t leave
unless i know he &apos;s okay .
i &apos;ll make sure he takes his vitamins .
let me help you . i can &apos;t leave dan in the hands of serena ,
or even worse , blair waldorf .
i just ... i want dan to be with a girl
who &apos;s not gonna corrupt his soul , and--
and trust me , i can give you better advice than that book .
with albert &apos;s illegitimate children ,
ernst &apos;s thai mistress ,
and stephanie &apos;s stint in the circus ,
i understand your apprehension
about a dark horse from the states ,
but i can assure you that the waldorfs are as prestigious
a family as america has ,
and i would never bring ignominy to louis .
oh , really ? seems to me that scandal is your middle name .
you blackmail teachers ,
bully underclassmen ,
a pregnancy scare ?
you dated lord marcus while he was sleeping
with his stepmother .
then you were traded by chuck bass--
whose name precedes him--
for a hotel .
i think this meeting is over .
no , princess , please let me explain .
it &apos;s not necessary , ms. waldorf .
i @-@ i &apos;ve had a past ,
but all my wrongdoings ,
all my secrets are right there in front of you .
&quot; gossip girl &quot; has been chronicling my mistakes
since i was 14 .
can you really say that about the other girls
invited to the party tomorrow ?
no , but i doubt that any of them
have performed in a burlesque club .
louis knows all about my past .
i &apos;ve grown . i &apos;ve changed .
i can be the next grace kelly .
what are you doing here ? i told you i &apos;m done .
i know , but i found this .
i think it was in the box with all the tapes .
fell out in my car .
it &apos;s dated the day before the fire .
read it .
&quot; you know how much you mean to me ,
but i can &apos;t do this anymore .
i &apos;m so sorry . avery . &quot;
my father and avery thorpe were having an affair .
and she was gonna leave him ,
go back to russell .
that &apos;s your motive .
the tapes show opportunity , and we already know
that bart admitted he was responsible for the fire , so ...
well , at least you can &apos;t hang a dead man .
i &apos;m sorry , chuck .
i know you didn &apos;t want your father to be guilty ,
but maybe now you can move on .
what was andrew tyler doing here ?
you okay ?
nothing a bottle of blue
and the dancers from &quot; spider @-@ man &quot; can &apos;t fix .
andrew and i were just wrapping things up .
how did your dinner with raina go ?
oh , not well . she basically walked out on me .
sorry , man , but she is dead set
on looking for her mother .
well , hopefully she doesn &apos;t find anything ,
gives up on her own .
or she finds her mom , and you &apos;ll know
once and for all you have nothing to worry about .
right .
nothing to worry about .
poor chuck . when you asked bart about the fire ,
no wonder an affair was something
he chose not to remember .
and we know albert is set to marry in july ,
20 years younger and swimmer .
i call her &quot; fishstock . &quot; not nice .
if she is there with prince , you need to curtsy to her .
if she there alone , no curtsy .
if you get engaged to louis ,
then she curtsy only if she not there with sovereign ,
but if she there with her prince
and you there with yours ,
i am no sure , so try and avoid her .
okay . got it . what &apos;s next ?
history . i @-@ i dig a little dirt , too . make us flash cards .
louis , what are you doing here ?
in this fairy tale , i like to play both prince
and fairy godfather .
for tonight .
but even if you wore a sack ,
you &apos;d be the most enchanting one there .
this prince growing on me by minute .
uh , dan . what are you doing here ?
my dad just asked me to drop off his lucky doc martens .
ah . cool . what are you doing today ?
because i was thinking about trying those pierogies
that you &apos;re always talking about ,
and according to bing ,
there is a really great place in queens .
look , charlie , we--we should talk .
okay . sure . yeah , what &apos;s up ?
i really like you . i do .
i @-@ i mean , you &apos;re smart and you &apos;re cool ,
kind of a spaz in a great way .
thank you ?
but i &apos;m just , uh ...
yeah , i @-@ i &apos;m not looking for a relationship right now .
no kidding ?
you &apos;re barely over the blair weirdness ,
never mind for serena to be as mad as she was
about the kiss .
um , i &apos;m not thinking of anything but friends .
okay . great . that &apos;s , uh , that &apos;s a relief .
you , serena , and eric
are the only people i know here ,
so i &apos;m sorry if i have been coming on too strong .
i &apos;ll tone it down a notch .
no , no , no , no , no . don &apos;t . i mean , seriously .
i &apos;m sorry i misinterpreted . look , uh , my dad is hosting
some business clients tonight at the loft .
eric will be coming . it &apos;ll be low @-@ key .
like , pizza , music .
sound like fun ? you in ?
uh , you know , it &apos;s that or &quot; masterpiece theatre &quot;
with lily again , so yeah , i &apos;m in .
but you have to let me help out . i can make homemade pizza .
are--are you sure ? i mean , i wouldn &apos;t want to put you out .
no , it &apos;s no trouble . just give me the keys .
i &apos;ll cook at the loft .
okay . all right . i just gotta go drop these boots off .
yeah .
good to see you survived the night .
maybe now you can actually talk about what we &apos;re gonna do here .
do ? about what ?
raina . she needs to know about her mother .
nathaniel .
i was thinking maybe we could tell her together
and show her the letter , then--
nate , are you out of your mind ?
between the videotape you told me about
and the letter from her mom , chuck ,
i can &apos;t let her get her hopes up .
she &apos;ll spend her whole life
searching for someone she &apos;ll never find .
don &apos;t say anything .
what am i supposed to do every time she brings up her mother ?
lie . i don &apos;t know .
you figure it out , or just stop seeing her .
chuck , i actually like this girl , man .
what &apos;s wrong with you , huh ?
you don &apos;t even know how to be in a relationship .
blair &apos;s lucky she escaped you .
hey ! leave blair out of this .
no one understands what we have .
yeah , no one understands because it &apos;s not normal .
she &apos;s better off with the french guy .
you can &apos;t seriously mean that .
i saw on &quot; gossip girl &quot;
that she &apos;s going to some party tonight at the consulate .
who cares ? she always goes to parties .
this one &apos;s hosted by his family .
apparently he needs to get engaged .
monaco &apos;s independence day .
november 19th .
patron saint .
sainte dote . serena !
there you are .
did you see the dress louis got me ?
ah , it &apos;s official .
we should send out change of address cards ,
because i &apos;m moving to cloud nine .
ah , louis is ... incredible .
with him by my side ,
i can actually be a powerful woman .
forget running anne archibald &apos;s charity .
i &apos;m gonna be negotiating peace in the sudan .
you really are happy , aren &apos;t you ?
which is why tonight has to go perfectly .
will you come with me ?
tonight ? yeah . yeah , sure .
oh , yay . you &apos;re the best friend a girl could have .
and just think ...
maybe one day soon , you &apos;ll be my maid of honor , too .
i would be honored .
i don &apos;t have my keys ,
but charlie &apos;s been inside cooking all day .
yeah , even if her food tastes like those cookies she made ,
be nice .
why ? cookies not good ?
surprise !
arthur , bring the car around . we got a party to crash .
wonder if chuck bass is about to go from down and out
to down on one knee .
nothing like using a rock to get out of a hard place .
princess maha galyani from thailand .
princess lucie of bavaria .
marchesa francesca mancini .
dorota &apos;s been quizzing me all day .
i &apos;m completely up to speed on my competition .
in it to win it , going big or going home .
relax , b. you don &apos;t need sports metaphors .
you &apos;ve been preparing for this your entire life .
now come on . let &apos;s go out there and show these people
what a real princess looks like ,
because in this town , you are royalty .
thank you , s. i couldn &apos;t do it without you by my side .
ms. blair waldorf from manhattan .
i dropped lily &apos;s name and credit card number ,
and per se agreed to cater .
it got a 28 in zagat .
i , uh , i thought you were making pizza .
well , who needs pizza when you have coq au vin ?
yeah , charlie , it &apos;s lovely .
okay , caviar and p ? should be out soon .
i just need to check one thing with the sommelier .
ah , there &apos;s a sommelier !
okay , your fonzie jacket
was a better idea than this .
dad , i &apos;m so sorry . i had no
idea that she would do any of this .
it &apos;s fine .
i just don &apos;t want charlie to think she &apos;s ruined anything .
you know , i &apos;ll head panic off downstairs , tell them there &apos;s
been a change of plans and take &apos; em out to eat .
great , okay , and we &apos;ll just tell them that the band canceled .
yeah , we &apos;ll take her to a movie or something .
okay .
hey , where are you going ?
uh , actually , um--
the band had a change of plans .
the band ?
i thought we were entertaining business associates .
i totally messed everything up , didn &apos;t i ?
i can &apos;t believe this . i ruined everything .
i was only doing what vanessa told me to do .
wait--
vanessa ?
oh , but you have to adore monte carlo .
nelson piquet likened racing around the course
to riding a bicycle in his living room .
oh , countess alexia , so lovely to meet you .
and how &apos;s your uncle , the viscount ?
i heard he gave up his chair at the university
over that unfortunate scandal with a student .
i guess not everyone likes oral exams .
contessa gina , lovely to meet you in person .
perhaps my mother finding out about us
was actually a blessing in disguise .
all my life ,
i thought i &apos;d be married to someone i didn &apos;t love .
maybe , just maybe , that nightmare
will turn into my dream .
chuck , what are you doing here ?
i need to see blair .
you &apos;re drunk . just go home , please .
i beg of you , don &apos;t ruin this for her .
i have something she needs to hear . it &apos;s important .
excuse me .
what are you doing here ?
i need to ask you something .
get out of here . this is not the time nor place for a scene .
your highness , tell me again
about your a capella club at oxford .
i get you don &apos;t wanna talk to me ,
but hiding out in your office seems a little extreme .
i &apos;m not hiding . i &apos;m working . why ? you have concerns
about the mets bullpen you need to mull over ?
you &apos;re right . i &apos;ve been avoiding talking to you
about your mother .
i was trying to protect someone , okay ?
i was wrong .
i don &apos;t understand .
protect someone ?
nate ...
do you know something ?
you look familiar .
didn &apos;t you , me , and a stewardess
get to know each other intimately over lithuania ?
excuse me .
i am princess sophie grimaldi of monaco .
ah , yes , blair &apos;s future mother @-@ in @-@ law .
there &apos;s no surprise she went for a prince .
marie antoinette was one of her favorite roles to play .
of course , i was always eating her cake .
how dare you . and you are ...
i &apos;m chuck bass , the love of her life .
anyone else is just a waste of time .
chuck , go home .
match , blair . you proved you can score a prince .
okay , i admit . you made me jealous .
now let &apos;s go back to my place so you can collect your prize .
stop this . you &apos;re embarrassing me .
what ? it &apos;s not me who &apos;s disrespecting these fine people .
it &apos;s you ,
pretending you &apos;re going to marry this french phony .
it &apos;s a joke .
chuck , no one &apos;s laughing . don &apos;t do this .
come here .
stop it ! this is enough !
no , stop !
security !
chuck , go home .
this is enough .
i &apos;m not going anywhere without you .
tell your prince where your heart truly lies . tell him .
tell me .
sir .
your royal highness , i &apos;m so , so ashamed
and sorry if my friends and i have caused any trouble .
sorry .
spotted--a prince torn
between choosing his kingdom or his queen .
end it . now .
in all my years of public humiliation ,
which--let &apos;s face it-- are many ,
that was the absolute worst .
well , maybe louis will come around .
perhaps , but his mother never will ,
and who can blame her ?
i should have known my past with chuck
would come back to haunt me .
you &apos;re probably gonna hate me for saying this ,
but as drunk and inappropriate as chuck was ,
i still felt a little bad for him .
what ? why ?
i don &apos;t know . i guess i just always thought
your prince was right here with his empire in manhattan .
wait . after what you witnessed tonight ,
you &apos;re taking his side ?
no
and don &apos;t think i don &apos;t know it was you
that sent princess sophie that scrapbook from &quot; gossip girl . &quot;
i assumed it was payback for dan ,
but maybe you were defending chuck , too .
blair , i feel awful .
louis made me happy .
happy .
do you know the last time i felt joy ?
chuck had brought me into his darkness for so long ,
i &apos;d forgotten what that felt like .
and with all your dan issues ,
it &apos;s obvious you think your romantic fate was sealed
in the 11th grade , but i &apos;m growing up .
i wanted something different . i wanted louis .
all my life , i thought my mother didn &apos;t love me .
raina , i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m so sorry .
there was insurance money-- a lot of it .
bart probably paid your father off
not to say anything to the police ,
but he should have told you years ago .
he didn &apos;t tell me because he knew the truth
was worth than the fiction .
this is too unbearable .
but at least i understand
why my father was so intent on crushing bass industries .
raina , look , i know you &apos;re going through a lot , okay , but--
chuck--he &apos;s just like his father .
he lied to me . he lied to you ,
and ... he tried to cover up the truth about my mother .
hey , he &apos;s had to deal with all this , too , you know--
don &apos;t you dare defend him , nate .
i &apos;m not .
if you wanna remain friends with him ,
then you &apos;re gonna have to get out of here now .
i mean it .
get out .
and vanessa said the loft
wasn &apos;t a suitable place to entertain business people ,
so she suggested that i , uh--
you throw a michelin star dinner ?
i mean , that must &apos;ve taken a lot of work .
it took all day .
i just wanted it to be perfect .
but why ? why &apos;d you do that ?
i think you know .
vanessa said if i helped rufus ,
uh , it &apos;d help me get you , too .
and now i &apos;m not only the loser who &apos;s responsible
for ... ruining your dad &apos;s job possibility ,
i &apos;m also the loser who lied to you
about liking you as a friend .
hmm , well , sounds like you &apos;ve learned your first lesson
of being an upper east sider .
i think it &apos;s time for your second lesson .
face your enemies .
you ready for your first showdown ?
if it &apos;s okay with you ,
i &apos;d like to talk to vanessa alone .
if i &apos;m gonna survive in this world ,
i gotta do it on my own , right ?
we &apos;ll meet at the loft when you &apos;re done with vanessa ,
maybe have some caviar and party ?
i get it , louis . tonight was a disaster .
you can save your sweet , remorseful breakup . i know .
i overheard your conversation with serena ,
and i want you to choose joy in your life .
more than that ,
i want to be the one who gives you joy .
your family is never going to approve of me .
not now .
forget them .
i &apos;ve spent my whole life
doing what they wanted--
being who they groomed me to be .
but if you &apos;re willing to fight for your happiness ,
then i &apos;m willing to fight for mine .
i bought this to give to you
after you had the royal court &apos;s approval .
but without it ,
it means even more .
i &apos;ve seen all the movies , louis .
if you don &apos;t get engaged to someone they want ,
then they &apos;ll find a way to make sure
you never ascend to the throne .
there &apos;s no point in being the head of state
if it means i can &apos;t follow my heart .
blair ...
will you marry me ?
hey . how &apos;s charlie ?
oh , she &apos;s , uh , she &apos;s fine .
she felt terrible , but turns out it wasn &apos;t her fault .
it &apos;s a--it &apos;s a long story . how &apos;d it go with the band ?
well , you &apos;re looking at panic &apos;s next producer .
what ? that &apos;s great ! uh , what &apos;d you do ?
well , i did what i should have done in the first place--
talked about music .
please tell me this means that lily can now donate
that leather jacket to charity .
you kidding ? i &apos;m saving that for the rock and roll hall of fame
or the smithsonian ,
right next to fonzie &apos;s actual jacket .
hey . i thought i was meeting dan .
he doesn &apos;t wanna see you .
why ? what happened tonight ?
because of you , i got per se to cater ,
rented crystal .
needless to say , it didn &apos;t work out .
i was humiliated .
what are you talking about ?
i told you to have a nice , relaxed , low @-@ key night .
yeah .
that &apos;s not what he thinks .
he &apos;s under the impression you tried to sabotage me .
why would you do that ? i was trying to help you get dan .
and you have .
i &apos;ve read &quot; gossip girl &quot; enough to know
that dan can &apos;t resist a damsel in distress ,
and you happen to make a perfect villain .
come on , vanessa .
if you actually knew how to get dan ,
you wouldn &apos;t be running away to study abroad .
don &apos;t worry , though .
i &apos;ll take good care of him while you &apos;re gone .
you came .
how could you do that to me , chuck ?
i &apos;m sorry i ruined your shot at being a princess .
but let &apos;s face it .
you were never gonna go through with it .
chuck .
i need you , blair ,
like i never have before .
everything i believed about my father ,
everything i thought i wanted to be ,
what i needed to be for him-- it was all based on lies .
the only thing that &apos;s ever been real is me and you .
and you know that .
that &apos;s why you came back to me .
louis asked me to marry him .
you &apos;ll never marry anyone else . you &apos;re mine .
i wanted to be .
i wanted it so badly , but ...
not anymore .
you &apos;re mine , blair .
stop it , chuck !
i said it &apos;s over .
once upon a time in the land of upper east ,
a beautiful girl fled from a beast .
hey , raina , it &apos;s me .
listen , you were right
about chuck . i choose you .
call me .
his closest friends began to retreat ...
no , you don &apos;t know me ,
but my father , russell thorpe ,
had planned on getting in touch with you .
it &apos;s about chuck , your nephew .
i &apos;ll explain it all in person .
i look forward to meeting you , too , jack .
while enemies marshaled to plan his defeat .
across the river in lands far away ,
a mysterious young maiden was making her play .
and with the beast finally vanquished ,
most tales--they would end ...
with one happy princess ...
and an excited best friend .
but in a land where the best castles
come with a view of the park , it &apos;s important to remember ...
mom ? i &apos;m sorry to wake you ,
but i have some news .
i &apos;m engaged .
where most fairy tales end ,
ours merely starts .
