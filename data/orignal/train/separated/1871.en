Say you're in the O.R...
repairing a vena cava,
when suddenly, everything goes to hell...
I think we should practice our statements to the judge.
I think you should stop worrying about it and relax.
I could help you with that.
Derek, we have 36 hours before we have to
convince a judge that we're Zola's parents.
We are Zola's parents.
But they don't know that.
And for all they know, we...
hate children.
We feed cute little kittens to a dog
we keep in the backyard.
Meredith.
I'm just saying, they don't know us.
All we have to do is just stand up there
and speak from the heart.
That's all the convincing they'll need.
Okay?
Okay.
So you cut this, suture that...
and soon that crappy situation is a thing of the past.
Hey.
I missed you this morning. Is everything okay?
Yeah. I just wanted to get a run in before work.
Okay. Well, uh, I gotta get upstairs
if I'm gonna beat Shepherd to rounds,
so I'll see you later?
Too bad you can't meet all of life's challenges
with a surgical scalpel.
Yeah.
All right. I'll see you later.
I mean, you could try.
Going up?
Nope.
Yeah, you are.
Ooh, Avery. Today's the day.
You, me, cross-facial nerve graft.
You pumped? I'm pumped.
All right.
Get pumped.
Getting pumped.
But I'm pretty sure that'd be considered assault.
Dr. Bailey,
I've been going over this islet cell data.
And I think that-- Dr. Bailey?
Are we not going to the mouse lab today? Because I--
We've got bigger things to worry about than mice, Grey.
Like, um...
guinea pigs?
Are your feet as quick as your wit?
Move 'em.
Ooh, sorry, Karev.
I'm gonna need your esophageal atresia.
What?
Oh, and you have a pyloric stenosis.
I might need that one, too.
What are you--why?
Well, 'cause we have a prospective peds fellow
coming in today,
and she's being courted by all the big guns--
U.S.C, Johns Hopkins, C.H.O.P.--
And--and Hunt asked me to help to make sure
she got the red-carpet tour,
and that includes scrubbing in on a couple of surgeries.
Wait.
You're already meeting people for the fellowship?
Well, it's a little early,
but when someone with Polly Preston's resume
wants to observe in your hospital, you make time.
Justine, these three bubble-like spots.
Those are your aneurysms.
J-j-just a second.
Um, sorry.
I didn't hear a word. Say again.
Ah. My aneurysms.
Horrible things.
What are they doing now, growing?
Is that why the god-awful headaches?
One has sprung a leak.
Great.
Go ahead. Say it.
Say "I told you so."
He's been warning me about this for years,
and I have been avoiding this surgery.
Fine.
Okay.
But it's gonna have to wait until I'm done with my book.
Dr. Grey, what are the possible consequences
of not fixing a warning leak?
Stroke, hemorrhage, death.
Dr. Grey, what are the possible consequences
for a botched clip?
Stroke, hemorrhage, death.
So I'm dead, and my book's not finished.
I can't do that to my readers.
I just need to find a way to get Kate to the bridge
where she's supposed to meet Nathan
before she's pulled back in time.
After that, I'm all yours.
Justine--
Yeah, between your voice and my leaky aneurysm,
I'm having a bitch of a time focusing, so...
Could you...
Please?
When I say this is a very important patient,
I mean, she is very important to me.
I do not like it, but I have a very full schedule today,
and you will have to be my proxy.
No one touches this patient but you.
You will run every test I ask for.
You will report every result back to me personally.
This woman has lost a husband and a son in this hospital.
I will not have another O'Malley lost under this roof.
O'Malley? George's mother is our V.I.P.?
Meredith Grey.
As promised.
It's been so long.
Oh, you come over here and give me a hug.
This is so freaking cool.
I bet it never occurred to you
to put this on your wish list.
How's that coming, by the way?
Why? Do you need it today?
Because I can't-- um, I'm not done.
You do get that this is supposed to be fun, right?
Right. I need more time.
Um, do you mind, um, just...
moving more to your left, please?
Your husband's in the gallery.
I know.
Henry's been begging for a ride-along.
I figured, if you're gonna observe a surgery,
this is the one you want to see.
How are we doing, Dr. Park?
Just a few more minutes,
and my guy down at U.C.L.A.
will have the heart he's been waiting on for over a year.
Okay.
Let's roll.
Got it.
Make sure that connection is secure.
This tube connects directly to the aorta.
That's right, and this tube removes waste.
Got it.
Dr. Park, your hospital's on the line.
Look at that.
She's about to catch a flight to L.A.
and not even know she left the body.
Damn it.
What is it?
My guy arrested.
They weren't able to resuscitate.
He's dead?
Damn it.
It's all dressed up, and no place to go.
Here. Let me get it.
It says here you've had surgery three weeks ago
at Seattle Pre. for a gallbladder removal?
I've gone back there a couple of times,
and they always tell me I'm fine and send me back home.
Uh, bring me a 20-gauge just in case,
and benzoin.
And, you know, it's freezing in here.
Have someone take a look at that thermostat.
Yes, doctor.
I'm going to palpate your abdomen,
and you let me know if you feel any discomfort, okay?
The boys insisted I do my surgery somewhere else,
after what happened here with Harold and...
and Georgie.
She's got some midepigastric tenderness.
We should check that gallbladder.
Uh, have you been experiencing any fevers at all, Louise?
Any pain, uh, vomiting?
Yes, actually, I have.
Mrs. O'Malley, those aren't good things.
I know. I'm sorry.
It's just that... Look at you.
You know how proud it makes me to have you as my doctor?
Thank you.
Grey, let's get a C.T., C.B.C., lytes,
and a liver panel,
and let's get another couple of blankets.
I kept hearing Georgie's voice saying,
"Mom, get a second opinion.
Go to Seattle Grace. They'll take care of you."
We will, Louise.
We're gonna take very good care of you.
A doctor.
You're all grown up.
Looks like Columbia's got a good match
who's already consented.
We're contacting them now to arrange pick-up,
but it will be hours before they arrive.
In the meantime, her vitals need to be monitored
and lactate levels checked hourly.
Okay, so I'll find an intern to babysit.
Oh, I, uh, I'm not leaving her with an intern.
You're not serious.
Dr. Yang, this is a beating heart in a box.
I'm very serious.
And you need more time
to finish your wish list anyway.
Right?
Page if you need me.
Shepherd, I can't approve this.
I'm not asking your approval.
I'm giving you a heads-up, as a courtesy.
Ah, I have to be at a board meeting.
Well, don't let me hold you up.
Yikes. These are intense.
Are these patients of yours?
They will be.
I went looking for patients
who were told "no" by every doctor they've seen.
So what are you gonna do?
Tell them "yes."
Tell them I will do my best.
It's not just me. It's you, too.
You ready?
Me?
I...
Y-yes, of course.
What's this?
Justine Campbell's, A.M.A. Forms.
She's leaving against medical advice so--
Oh, so you're not ready.
What? Why?
Yes. We're saying yes.
If you can't get her to say yes
to a simple surgery that will save her life,
how do you expect to tackle that?
Tear those up.
Get her to say yes, and I'll let you jump on one of these.
Okay? What do you say?
Yes.
Damn right.
Come on. Tell me I'm paranoid or something.
You're paranoid.
Thank you.
Although, she did throw a softball at his girlfriend.
I know. Screw this.
You know, I can't be around Sloan today. I...
Just take me off plastics, just for the day.
I gotta clear my head.
I am not gonna rearrange the whole surgical schedule
just 'cause you're having girl problems.
Just suck it up.
You guys ever hear of a Polly Preston?
Chief resident at the Brigham?
She's only my number one peer role model.
You're a freak, and I hate you.
What are you working on today, Karev?
A fat lot of nothing now. Why?
How would you feel about a nerve graft?
I would feel great about a nerve graft.
Fine.
Thank you.
The pain's getting worse?
Does it look like it's getting better?
I know what can really help.
What?
Clipping your aneurysm.
Cute.
Look, I'm sure if you call your publishers
and you tell them, they'll extend the deadline.
It is not about a deadline.
It's about my readers out there,
who are waiting for me to finish a series
that they have been following for ten years.
You're really that popular?
You really know how to kick a girl in the ego, don't you?
I'm--I'm sorry.
We don't get a lot of time to read around here.
What about your family?
I-I mean, I'm--I'm sure that they wouldn't want--
Do you see any family sitting with me, Dr. Grey?
I'm a writer.
My characters are my family,
and I care about them.
And I've managed to make a lot of other people
care about them as well.
Yes, I want to give my readers closure.
But Kate and Nathan and Alexander,
I owe them closure.
And I'm the only one who can give it to 'em.
I'm just trying to help you.
You want to help me?
Yeah.
How fast can you type?
Hot diggity.
There it is.
I, uh, ran into Altman,
and she told me what you were up to this morning.
And I swear, I can't believe it.
It's astounding.
What are you, uh, working on over there?
Altman is offering to track down
surgeries I want to perform.
Uh, may I?
Oh, no. This is--
Thanks.
Let's see what we got here.
Yang, what's wrong with you?
You're wasting an opportunity
on 300 pages of common procedure.
She let a starving person loose in a grocery store.
She asked what I want. I want everything.
What am I supposed to do?
Get creative.
I mean, I mean, look--look at that.
Okay.
It's the key.
To what?
To the list.
So use it.
Use the key.
Unlock your mind.
What are you talking about?
I'm just talking about a heart-in-a-box.
A heart-in-a-box.
Hot diggity.
It's such a treat, seeing you again, Meredith.
I want to hear everything. How have you been?
Catch me up.
I-I got married.
Oh, that's wonderful. Any kids?
No. We're-- we're working on it.
Callie.
Oh, my God!
Mama O'malley.
Hi. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
It's so good to see you.
I know. I haven't, uh, I-I haven't called,
and I meant to call so many times,
but you're here now, right--right now.
Why...
Why are you here? Are you okay? Is she okay, Grey?
Yeah, we're hoping.
I'm just waiting for C.T. to open up.
Okay, good. Right. Good.
Hello.
Hi.
Oh, right. Sorry.
This is...
Dr. Robbins.
Louise O'malley.
That's us.
Good-bye, dear.
Oh, it was really nice to see you.
You okay?
Yeah, I think so. Maybe?
Hold on.
Yes.
Polly? Okay, you're here.
I'm on my way.
My prospective peds fellow's here, so I gotta run.
Okay.
I'll see you later...
Dr. Torres.
Imagine my surprise...
when I check out the schedule expecting to see
Jackson Avery's name on it,
only to find he's been replaced by Alex Karev.
We've been preparing this nerve graft for weeks.
I know.
I mean, it's just you and me.
The plastics posse...
Kicking surgical ass and taking names.
The plastics posse?
Ah, just something I'm trying out.
Look, Dr. Sloan, the thing is,
I gotta get this paper in by 7:00 tonight
or I am screwed.
It's just bad timing.
Wait.
You're missing a rock-star nerve graft for a paper?
I know. It's fifth year.
You know? I can't slack off now, right?
Oh, hey, Dr. Torres.
Oh, I'm sorry. I panicked.
I didn't mean to introduce you as Dr. Robbins.
But I guess I didn't know how to say,
"Hey, guess what, Mama O'malley,
I'm into girls now, and, uh, oh,
and this is my wife."
You know?
Polly.
Yes, Dr. Robbins.
I'm gonna need a minute.
Sure thing.
I'm gonna go take a look at your nuclear protein machines.
Okay.
Peds prospect Polly?
Yep.
Oh, I'm doing so well today.
I get it. It's okay.
Wait. Really?
'Cause you seemed kind of pissed.
Really? I thought I was being funny.
Oh, well, then you suck at jokes.
Oh. Hey, look, coming out is important.
It's everything.
With your family and your friends,
I'd kick your ass if you tried to hide me from them.
But coming out to your dead ex-husband's super Catholic mom?
Not necessary. I mean, not for you.
And certainly not for me. So it's okay.
Thank you.
Okay. I'm gonna go, find Polly
'cause I have no idea
where we'd keep the nuclear protein machines.
Excuse me.
Sloan will not shut up about you.
I wouldn't have taken the surgery
if I knew I was breaking up the plastics posse.
He's using that in public now?
What? You're lucky.
I wish I had an attending
who had my back like Sloan's got yours.
Excuse me.
Hey, no cuts.
Oh, sorry. I just gotta get back to my patient.
Oh, my god. You guys should read this.
It's--it's amazing.
Oh, wait.
Is that one of those books about the time-traveling chick?
Yeah, every other mom in peds has got one in her purse.
'Cause they're awesome.
I mean, one minute, Kate is running through 1890s Paris,
with this pickpocket that she loves but can't trust,
and the next thing she knows, she's being pulled across time,
dodging Nazis with this adorable American G.I.
It's like <i>Slaughterhouse Five</i>, but totally hot.
'Cause that's what Vonnegut's missing, hotness.
Okay, I gotta go.
Come on. Let's eat somewhere else.
It's kind of soothing,
like sitting in front of a fishtank.
It's not a fishtank.
It's a key.
What's that supposed to mean?
Ask Webber.
He came in here, trashing my wish list,
and told me heart-in-a-box was the key to fixing it.
Well, I'll tell you something, she's not talking.
Heart-in-a-box, what should I put on my wish list?
Heart-in-a-box, what should I put on my sandwich?
See? Nothing.
Heart-in-a-box, what's wrong with George's mom?
Who's george?
He used to work here. He died.
Whoa. Who died?
George.
And we're talking about that creep because?
Alex, you're an ass.
His mom's in the hospital.
Wow. O'Malley.
I haven't thought about him in--
Why would you?
Alex.
Oh, come on. Don't act like you stay up nights
writing poetry about the guy.
Remember when you gave him syphilis?
How...
What?
Remember heart-in-an-elevator?
Heart-in-an-elevator.
I should put that on my list.
George made you look like such a chump.
George was the heart-in-the-elevator guy?
I heard about that. That sounded badass.
Were you there?
I just wanted to eat my freakin' lunch. That's all.
Wait. Wait.
Everyone, shut up.
Heart-in-a-box,
Heart-in-an-elevator?
It works.
It totally works.
Webber is a genius.
Heart-in-a-box is starting to creep me out.
Don't talk about her that way.
Kate looked at Alexander
with pity more than anything.
"Fine," She said.
"Go. Go wherever the hell you want,
but first, you're gonna apologize."
Why?
Why what?
Why is he apologizing?
Alexander?
Because he stole the ring that Nathan gave her
in book two.
What? Nathan gave her a ring.
Yes, he did, in book two.
Does Alexander know that
Nathan gave it to her?
No, Dr. Grey, he is a thief.
If a thief sees a ring, he's gonna take it.
But he promised that he was going to change.
Dr. Grey.
What?
I'm doing what you told me to do.
I told you to get her to the O.R..
You're hosting a book club.
She won't go into an O.R. until she finishes her book.
I'm helping her finish.
And how long will that take?
You can't rush the creative process.
Grey, I asked you for preliminary tests
and hourly reports.
What part of that did you interpret as,
"Also, if you find the time,
please shove a scope down
Mrs. O'malley's throat"?
Her endoscopic ultrasound
showed a 16-milimeter dilation of the common duct.
I also did not ask for an endoscopic ultrasound.
See? Why can't you just do
the things that I ask you to do?
Oh, look. There.
See? She's got inflammation
and scar tissue around the remnant cystic duct.
She's gonna need surgery.
Wonderful. You just proved that
your former colleague's mother
had a botched surgery at another hospital--
A hospital that she only went to
because we let her down
so shamefully in the past.
I just don't know why you're celebrating.
I'm not celebrating--
Just go prep her for surgery.
Or is that too much to ask?
You were amazing in there.
I mean, from where I was standing,
It looked like you pretty much rebuilt that guy's heart.
What do you call that again?
A modified Fontan procedure.
Ah, after Dr. Fontan?
I can only assume.
Well, I can only assume that Dr. Fontan
Never looked as hot doing his own procedure...
as my wife just did.
What happens in here?
So the surgeons at Seattle Pres.
left a length of cystic duct
inside of you when they operated.
That's what's causing your problems.
So we're gonna take that out.
Do you have any questions?
I saw a ring.
Excuse me?
On Callie's finger
when we ran into her earlier.
Did she get remarried?
She did.
A few months ago, actually.
Aw. Oh, good.
Do you think--is she happy? Oh, I hope she's happy.
She seems happy.
Do you have any questions about your surgery?
I raised a bunch of boys.
It was so nice to finally have a daughter.
I miss her, all of you, really.
George's friends.
Oh, you were so important to him,
to me.
Well, you're doing exactly what george would be doing--
Being in charge.
Oh, you'll be doing my surgery, won't you, dear?
All by yourself.
If you're uncomfortable, I--
Oh, no. No, don't be silly.
George said you were the best.
I'm comfortable.
I'm more than comfortable. I'm--I'm ready.
Let's--let's do this. Let's cut me open.
I'm gonna need the hand back for the surgery.
Avery.
We're about to get to the hypoglossal nerve.
Why don't you come down here and get a closer look?
I'd just get in the way.
I can see fine from here.
You're a fool, Avery.
Sitting in the gallery
when you should be grafting nerves?
You're lost.
Adrift.
You know what you need?
No, sir. I don't.
You need to see heart-in-a-box.
Yeah, I've seen it.
Maybe you looked at it.
But if you really saw it,
you'd be down in that O.R. right now.
See it, Avery.
See heart-in-a-box.
Any idea what's going on with Avery?
He seems so distant.
You want me to put a note in his locker?
What's that?
You want me to suture in the graft?
No, I'll handle that.
Hey, what did you find?
Oh, there were retained stones
blocking her cystic duct remnant.
Oh, okay. Well, that's not super serious.
She should be okay, right?
Yeah, she'll be fine.
Okay, good. Thanks. Yeah.
Oh, uh, she knows you're married.
What?
How? H-how did she find--
She saw your ring this morning.
She asked me, and all I said is that you were happy.
It's not your place to say anything.
She's going into surgery, and she's scared,
and she's alone and she misses you.
I know it's complicated,
but I don't think it would be a bad thing if you were there
to hold her hand when she woke up.
Hey, you got a second?
Wait just one second.
I'm a little worried about Avery.
I'm--I'm this close to getting this.
We had a real connection, you know?
Okay.
Well, we were having such a good time together,
and suddenly he's avoiding me.
He's cold and... distant.
Well, you're afraid
you're about to have your heart broken by him.
Kind of.
Derek, you know me.
I never gave a crap about teaching in my life.
But lately, I like the idea of passing it on.
And I, you know, I just-- I want to see him do well.
Maybe I just need to back off.
Ah, Hunt. Just in time.
Mark is afraid that Avery is gonna break up with him.
Can this just stay between you and me?
I'd prefer that.
Uh, Shepherd, about these cases--
I know what you're gonna say.
You're worried about the hospital's mortality rate going up.
See, that's the worst part about being chief.
You have to say no to everybody, and they hate you for it.
And you say no enough,
you're gonna hate yourself,
which is why I'm not gonna watch you go through this.
I have a consult.
If you love someone, set them free.
If they come back...
I'm gonna punch you.
Hey, let me ask you something.
No.
I gotta say, I'm a big fan of what happens in this room.
Mm. Every day should be...
Bring-your-husband-to-work Day.
Listen, I've had this idea.
I felt silly even considering it.
Like, "Really?
Y-you think that's something you're gonna do?"
But now, though, I'm thinking I really want to do it.
I want to go back to school.
Oh, okay. I mean...
I mean, that's not silly.
Adults go back to school all the time.
Medical school.
Wow.
I mean...
Wow.
Yeah.
Hey, what time is it?
We got another surgery to get to.
Come on. Up and at 'em.
Kate couldn't keep it to herself any longer.
She took him by the hand
and looked deep into those ocean blue eyes.
"I have figured out why I travel through time, Nathan.
I have figured it out, and now I know how I can stop it."
Oh, my God.
"I can choose where to be, when to be.
And I have. I have chosen."
oh, my God. Yes.
Nathan pulled her into his arms and held on tightly.
Kate whispered against his chest,
"I'm sorry. I am so, so sorry."
Wait. What?
She'd never know if he heard her.
When she opened her eyes,
Nathan was gone.
She was in Paris.
It was time to look for Alexander.
What?
She chooses Alexander?
No!
No way. It ha-- it has to be Nathan.
It's not Nathan.
But he's--he's so handsome and good.
And--and Alexander--
Is her soul mate.
He doesn't even have a soul.
I mean, he's a criminal.
They--they--they don't even want the same things.
They make each other miserable.
Dr. Grey, I cannot betray my characters--
You're the writer.
You can make them do whatever you want.
And--and picking Nathan,
that is the right thing to do.
Ohh.
You hate it. No, I-I know.
No, no. You hate it.
Oh, God.
Okay, page Shepherd. Now.
I think her aneurysm blew.
Suction.
Oh, damn. It's a big bleed.
If you had spent less time taking dictation,
we could've avoided this.
Did she at least finish the book?
No,
but she did tell me how it's gonna end.
It's so stupid.
She--she's written this incredible story
with these amazing characters,
and then she just blows it.
Wow. You're 15 right now.
It's criminal, what she's doing.
And--and when she wakes up,
I'm gonna tell her that.
Or maybe it's none of your business.
It's the same thing that you are doing
with these hopeless cases.
You know, you think that you can change
the way the patient's story is gonna end.
And if you think that,
then you're at least obligated to try.
So I gotta try, right?
Yes.
You double-checked her labs and scans?
Yes, of course.
I just don't want any surprises once I'm in there.
Actually, she thought I'd be performing her surgery.
Oh, I'm not comfortable with that.
I can do a septoplasty. You taught me a septoplasty.
I thought I taught you a lot of things.
Now I'm thinking, I must not be much of a teacher at all.
I'm going to court tomorrow...
to prove to a judge that's never met me that I'm a good person,
a fit mother.
I want my kid back so badly,
I'm racking my brain for anything
that'll make him see me that way.
I want to dress the part, so I'm thinking my navy dress.
But there's a button missing, and it shows too much cleavage.
My charcoal pants have a hole in the ass.
I've got one shot at this.
I'm useless...
and frustrated.
But I know how to do an E.R.C.P.,
and I know when to double-check labs.
And I know how to do a septoplasty.
I'm not useless here.
Fine. Do the surgery.
Off-pump coronary bypass.
No.
En bloc transplant,
Heart and both lungs.
Yes.
I don't get it.
I mean, Webber talks about this thing
like it's a magic 8 ball.
It's a heart...
in a box.
Okay, when you take an organ out for transplant,
what do you do?
Put it on ice.
Yeah, you put it on ice
and run to place it in the recipient's body,
and then you wait and hope
for this cold, dead heart
to warm up and come back to life, right?
But she--
She?
She has never stopped beating.
She's never stopped being warm,
never stopped living.
Sure, it's pretty--
it's a friggin' miracle.
Okay? You're standing before a miracle.
And once you realize that,
she'll change your perspective.
Okay, here's what I do.
I look at an item on my list,
I look at heart-in-a-box.
And if that surgery on my list
isn't half as cool as heart-in-a-box,
then it is not worth my time.
She lets you know what's most important to you.
That's what heart-in-a-box does.
And she's nice to talk...
Shh.
Shut up. Shut up.
What do you think about the University of Washington?
Um, I'm not sure.
It's not like Harvard or Stanford. It feels--
I don't know. It feels doable.
Doable?
Okay, I-I--I'm sorry, but...
Medical school isn't something that you--you--you--
You just decide to do.
Really? How did it happen for you?
The lady of the lake appeared with a gilded scalpel
and anointed you a med student?
Ha ha.
I'm actually being serious right now.
I mean, how is my decision to go to med school
any different than yours?
First of all, I was 19.
All right, great. So I'm old. What else?
Uh, I don't know.
Um, have you taken your three years of prerequisites?
Uh, how about the M-CAT?
No, I have not, but I do have a college degree.
I may have been a baseball player,
but I think I remember how to study.
Okay, that still doesn't account for
the four years of actual med school.
And--and if you decide to go completely crazy
and you want to try to become a surgeon,
That's five years of residency,
a fellowship--
No, I never s--
I never said I wanted to be a surgeon.
There are plenty of other ways to use a medical education.
Okay, fine.
Fine.
I love the way things are right now.
I really do.
And I don't want to spend ten years
married to a med student.
No. You'd just rather I followed you around,
Looking cute.
Okay, you know what?
You--you know that that's not what I'm saying.
I was gonna die.
My disease was going to kill me.
And then I met you.
You came into my life,
and suddenly I have insurance,
I have a wife,
I have a life expectancy beyond the next three months.
Sue me if I don't want to waste any of it.
Henry,
I-- just--
I'm...
I'll see you at home.
Okay, probe passes easily through the common duct.
One more biopsy, and I think we're ready to close.
Dr. Bailey, is there something wrong?
Did I miss something?
This woman worked so hard
to raise her son, and then...
one day, he just threw himself in front of a bus.
I mean, yeah, yeah, he did it to save someone else, but...
you work and work,
trying to teach your kids to do the right thing,
and--and you want to be so proud of them
when they stand up for what they believe is right.
But watching them destroy themselves...
In order to do it, to do what you taught them,
it's...
it's just maddening.
You. You are maddening.
He was my favorite...
George O'Malley.
He was...
my favorite.
I know.
He was the good one.
So I'm going to put in a T-tube.
Wear a sweater set.
Um, people have, uh,
preconceived notions about surgeons.
They think we're cold,
intimidating, egotistical.
A sweater set says you're warm, motherly.
If it was me, I'd wear a sweater set.
Thank you.
Hey. You paged?
I, uh, I can't get outta here yet.
I gotta follow up with my patient,
make sure she's in her right frame of mind.
Yeah.
You okay?
Yeah, I just... I missed a surgery today that...
That's not true.
I avoided a surgery today,
one I wanted to do for weeks.
Because of this thing with you and Mark.
There is nothing between me and Mark.
Yeah, I've been trying really, really hard to believe that.
But there is a thing.
And it's not going anywhere anytime soon.
And this new thing with me and plastics?
That's not going away either.
Something's gotta budge.
So I have to walk away...
from you... for me.
So...
you're picking Mark?
I've spent way too much time
sabotaging my own career, Lex.
Yeah...
I'm picking Mark.
Can you...
Can you tell me I shouldn't?
Heard a helicopter touched down on the roof.
Let them come.
You were right.
She was the key.
Now this is a fine list.
Thank you, sir.
You made a list, too?
I was inspired.
Oh, oh, I wish... I-I want to put this on my list.
If one of those comes in,
we'll have to see who gets to it first.
Okay.
Okay.
Hi.
We're the procurement team from Columbia.
She's all yours.
Heart-in-a-box.
Hot diggity.
How are you feeling?
Like a woman who just had brain surgery.
Fair enough. Can you tell me your name?
Justine... Campbell.
And what's today's date?
I never know the date. Ask me something else.
Why can't Kate choose Nathan?
She's going to.
I mean, you just feel like you have a moral obligation to...
Wait, really?
Yeah. For now.
I had a dream while I was under, and I figured out
how to stretch the series out two or three more books.
So... for now,
she'll get to see what it feels like to be with Nathan.
So... what?
They're gonna be together for a few books,
and then she's gonna choose Alexander?
Yeah, probably.
What is wrong with you?
I mean, why do you hate Nathan so much?
I don't hate Nathan.
I love him,
probably as much as you apparently do.
He's kind and funny
and incredibly honest.
It's Kate.
She doesn't love him.
She should.
I know.
It's not fair.
I know.
But it makes for a really, really good read.
Hey.
Hey.
Come here.
Do you want to work on the book a little bit more?
Will that make you feel better?
Okay.
Callie.
Hey.
Meredith said the surgery went great.
Oh. Yeah.
I like girls.
Uh... As in... romantically.
It turns out, I like girls.
Uh, women.
And I met the most amazing woman.
Do-do you remember dr. Robbins from this morning?
Yeah, we got married, and, uh,
oh, no, but before that, we, um...
we got in an accident, a car accident,
a really bad accident, and, uh, I almost died.
But I didn't, and, uh, Sofia...
neither did sofia, our-our baby...
Our perfect, beautiful baby.
And I'm, um...
I'm...
screwing all this up.
Look, I...
I know this is a lot.
And I-and I understand.
Um, and if this is too much for you to handle,
believe me...
My own mother practically disowned me,
so I understand.
Oh, God. I'm making you cry.
Please don't cry.
You have a baby?
I-I do.
Do you have any pictures?
You want to see 'em?
Are you kidding?
Okay.
Oh.
Oh, she's beautiful.
Thank you.
That man just booked a flight from Wichita.
You want to tell him no, I'll give you his number.
You can tell him yourself.
I'm not worried about
the hospital's mortality rates, Derek.
Mm. I'm worried about you.
You've had a lot of losses this year,
and I am concerned that you're lining yourself up for more.
You're worried about my reputation.
Well, there is that.
I don't have a reputation anymore.
See, I was gonna be the guy who cured Alzheimer's.
Now I am blacklisted by the FDA,
so I don't have to worry about that anymore.
I get to choose what I worry about.
And I choose them.
I feel I can change their story.
I owe it to them to at least try.
That's...
pretty damned arrogant, don't you think?
Well, I have a reputation for arrogance.
Could I have a cabernet?
Actually, make that a scotch and soda.
Okay.
You know what? Forget the soda.
Hi, it's me.
Turns out today was a bust.
She kept going on about this guy
who helped these kids in Africa.
And I was like, "Have you seen my three articles?"
But apparently, this guy raps puppies,
so who cares about me?
Anyway, my plane lands at 10:00,
so wait up.
I'm gonna be drunk.
And I'm gonna cry.
Just warning you.
I have to catch a plane.
Keep the change. Thanks.
Avery, wait up.
Oh, right, Dr. Sloan.
You need to talk to me.
I am sorry about today...
No, I'm sorry.
It was my...
No, you don't have anything to be sorry about.
No, I think I should apologize to you for...
No, it wasn't you.
It was me. I have been...
I just think we had some...
I don't want to screw things up.
Okay, I'm gonna talk, then you talk, okay?
Okay.
I want to be your teacher.
I want to be your student.
I have a cranial vault reconstruction tomorrow.
I will be there.
Good.
Good.
Great.
I guess the...
plastics posse is back in action.
Kicking surgical ass and taking names.
Oh. Just... all right.
Just do that. Yeah.
Great.
Okay.
All right.
Drive safe.
It's a little bit horrifying
just how quickly everything can fall to crap.
O'malley wasn't a creep, okay?
If he were here now, he'd be kicking all of our asses.
He would've slapped chief resident right out of Kepner's hand.
I just don't like thinking about him
because then I have to think about Izzie,
and then I get all sad and sappy and...
I totally miss the chance to nail hot, drunk chicks
who spent the day thinking about how I'm awesome
which I should be all about.
George is dead, and Izzie is gone,
and we're all different.
We're different.
Sometimes it takes a huge loss
to remind you of what you care about the most.
Sometimes you find yourself becoming stronger as a result,
wiser, better equipped to deal with
the next big disaster that comes along.
Hey.
That was our first real fight.
You okay?
Okay, okay, okay, okay. It's okay.
Okay. You're gonna be okay.
It's okay. It's okay.
Sometimes...
Look at me.
You're gonna be okay.
But not always.
