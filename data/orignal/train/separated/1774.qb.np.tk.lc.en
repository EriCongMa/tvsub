have you guys seen this feature
that lets you talk to siri without pressing any buttons ?
no . how does it work ?
you just say , uh , &quot; hey , siri , what time is it ? &quot;
the time is 6 : 37 p.m.
so now anyone can control your phone ?
hey , siri , show me pictures of naked grandma butts .
nice try .
it only recognizes my voice .
oh . cool .
hey , siri , show me pictures of naked grandma butts .
i don &apos;t sound like that .
here are some images of naked grandma butts .
hey . good news , everybody .
now that i &apos;m no longer with amy ,
i have an extra ticket to the annual thanksgiving lunch buffet
at the aquarium cafeteria . who wants it ?
well , you realize you won &apos;t be going alone--
i &apos;ll be there the whole time .
providing fish and pilgrim facts .
can you people hear me ?
well , we &apos;re having everyone over .
yeah , leonard and i are gonna be cooking all day .
otherwise we &apos;d love to .
but we can &apos;t .
yeah , poor us .
and raj and i are volunteering at the soup kitchen ,
feeding food to the homeless .
well , howard , what about you ?
oh ... i can &apos;t .
i &apos;m going to the soup kitchen , too .
you said that sounded like the worst thing ever .
if you can &apos;t support me when i &apos;m lying ,
why are we married ?
hi , sheldon . what &apos;s up ?
well , i &apos;m calling because thanksgiving is coming up ,
and i wanted to offer you the aquarium tickets .
no one can go with you ?
no . they &apos;d rather spend the holiday with each other
than find out if this is the year i finally touch a starfish .
anyway , i wouldn &apos;t want the tickets to go to waste ,
so take whomever you &apos;d like .
okay . thank you .
and feel free to tell your guest that
the myanmar catfish is also known as the pilgrim fish .
in case the turkey &apos;s dry
and you need something juicy .
sheldon ... i can tell you want to go ,
so if you &apos;d be comfortable with it ,
maybe we could go as friends .
you don &apos;t think that will be awkward ?
well ... it is thanksgiving in an aquarium cafeteria ,
so i &apos;m gonna go out on a limb here and say yes .
but if you mean between us ...
i think it &apos;ll be fine .
very well , then .
i &apos;ll see you on thanksgiving morning .
see you then .
oh , and forget what i said about the myanmar catfish .
my list of marine @-@ themed pilgrim facts is pretty short .
did you know they served shellfish and eel
at the very first thanksgiving ?
and there goes my list .
so , how does this work ?
the soup kitchen manager assigns the jobs ,
and the shifts are six hours .
six hours ?
oh , god , i don &apos;t want to complain for that long .
do you ever do anything for anyone else ?
i happen to be a giving and generous lover .
are you and i close enough for me to say that &apos;s creepy ?
we are , and i believe the word you &apos;re looking for is ... yech !
uh , can i help you ?
hi . we &apos;d like to volunteer .
oh , i appreciate you guys coming down ,
but we already have enough people .
any other day , please , come back .
oh . okay .
wipe that smug smile off your face .
maybe i &apos;m happy that so many people turned up
to help the less fortunate .
are you and i close enough for me to say ...
that he &apos;s an ass ? he beat you to it .
i was wrong . a large group had to cancel .
oh , great . we &apos;d love to help .
wipe that smug smile off your face .
i can &apos;t !
look at us !
our first thanksgiving as husband and wife .
i know .
i feel so grown up .
sweetie , you are grown up .
really ?
how many grown @-@ ups do you know
who have mr. spock oven mitts ?
hey , the recipes are on my ipad .
will you pull &apos; em up ?
yep .
what &apos;s the code ?
my birthday .
it &apos;s not working .
it &apos;s just the four digits-- month and day .
nope .
let me see .
yeah , there .
what number were you putting in ?
you don &apos;t know my birthday , do you ?
yes , i do .
well , what is it ?
may .
may what ?
i &apos;m not gonna say your password out loud .
that is not secure .
you don &apos;t know your own husband &apos;s birthday .
well ... you don &apos;t know everything about me .
your birthday is december 2,
you grew up on perkins street ,
the last four digits of your social are
7 @-@ 6 @-@ 2 @-@ 1,
and the odds of me letting you forget this are zero .
oh , look at us .
our last thanksgiving as husband and wife .
hello .
hi .
ready for the aquarium ?
i am .
you know , and in an effort to reduce awkwardness
as we learn how to function as friends ,
i printed out a list of safe topics for polite conversation .
if that makes you more comfortable .
if there were a list of things that make me more comfortable ,
lists would be on the top of that list .
okay , now ... oh .
&quot; since last we spoke , have you acquired any pets ? &quot;
no . you ?
no .
um , &quot; since last we spoke ,
have you planned or gone on any vacations ? &quot;
i might go visit my aunt next week .
mm . your aunt in modesto ?
no , the one in bakersfield .
bakersfield . i see .
where has this list been all my life ?
we &apos;re gonna have you washing dishes .
uh , aprons and rubber gloves are here-- just ...
scrape , wash and stack .
if you need me , i &apos;ll be around .
so we don &apos;t even get to be up front where the action is ?
what difference does it make ?
i don &apos;t know . i was hoping some poor kid
would come up to me and say ,
please , sir , i want some more .
you &apos;re in a soup kitchen ,
not a production of oliver !
it &apos;s not like i &apos;m expecting them to sing .
... and then the next day was 73 degrees ,
and the day after that was 72,
and then it was 72 again ...
uh , then it was 74,
and that brings us to today , at--
i &apos;d wear shorts if i had a pair-- 78 .
are we done discussing the weather ?
i don &apos;t know if i &apos;d call it &quot; discussing . &quot;
you kind of sat back and let me do all the work .
let &apos;s see what &apos;s next on the list .
oh , here . uh , &quot; do you whittle ,
and if so , what kind of knife do you ... &quot;
sheldon .
we &apos;ve known each other a long time .
we are perfectly capable of having a conversation
without relying on a list off the internet .
all right .
well , what should we talk about ?
i don &apos;t know . just ask me whatever comes to mind .
very well .
i know you &apos;ve been seeing other men .
have you had coitus with any of them ?
man , i walked right into that one .
next we need a teaspoon of pepper ,
which , i believe , was also the name of your childhood dog .
fine . you think you know so much .
who &apos;s my favorite spice girl ?
baby .
who &apos;s my favorite member of nsync ?
justin .
who &apos;s my favorite backstreet boy ?
属于竞争关系
nice try . nsync forever .
damn it !
face it , you can &apos;t stump me--
i am the king of husbands .
i know that you don &apos;t like the lingerie
that i got you on valentine &apos;s day .
i know you hate the word &quot; moist . &quot; i know ...
hang on .
wait , wait . why don &apos;t i like the lingerie you got me ?
because it &apos;s orange
and you think it makes you look like a slutty carrot .
interesting .
i never told you that .
sure you did .
no .
i never told anyone that .
but i did write it in my journal .
what ?
i didn &apos;t know you had a journal .
i also know your voice gets higher when you &apos;re lying .
no , it doesn &apos;t .
you know , this reminds me of high school .
you worked in a restaurant ?
no , i was in india-- it was humid and smelled funny .
all right , i think i &apos;m getting into a groove here .
this isn &apos;t so bad .
only five hours and 40 minutes to go .
we &apos;ve only been doing this 20 minutes ? !
you know , i read that
washing dishes can be an excellent form of meditation .
the key is that while washing the dishes
one should only be ... washing the dishes .
just because you have that accent
doesn &apos;t mean what you say isn &apos;t stupid .
no , seriously .
it &apos;s about being present in the moment ,
focusing on the feeling of the warm water ,
the smell of the detergent ,
the sound of the dishes squeaking , and following your own breath .
it &apos;s about ... it &apos;s about simply being .
okay . i &apos;ll try it .
i need three people out front .
i &apos;ll do it !
me !
right here !
no fair ! i was meditating !
come on , don &apos;t be mad .
it was a long time ago , and it was an accident .
how can reading my journal be an accident ?
i didn &apos;t even know what it was .
i saw it on your nightstand . i picked it up .
well , when you realized what it was , why didn &apos;t you stop ?
you know me , i &apos;m a big ol &apos; bookworm .
all right . let &apos;s just finish cooking .
well ... hey . o @-@ okay . let me make this up to you .
sometimes i keep an online journal .
i want you to read something that i write .
okay , really , i &apos;m fine .
okay .
well , then i &apos;ll read it to you .
it &apos;s from the day we first met .
&quot; beauty , thy name is penny . &quot;
oh , god . stop .
i don &apos;t want you to read something you think &apos;ll just butter me up .
i want to hear the most recent thing you wrote .
fine .
&quot; penny &apos;s beauty , like our love ,
grows more with each passing day . &quot;
does it really say that ?
why would i lie ?
&quot; omg . omg .
we &apos;re so close to the new star wars .
i can &apos;t take it .
gah . &quot;
&quot; gah &quot; ?
well , you didn &apos;t read it right .
the new star wars is coming . gah !
i &apos;m sensing things have gotten awkward .
no . it &apos;s okay .
if we &apos;re friends , we should be able to talk about anything .
all right .
so , you had some questions about me seeing other people .
just a few .
go ahead .
how many dates have you been on ?
who were they with ? where &apos;d you go ?
where did you meet them ? did you sleep with them ?
and how much longer to the aquarium ?
i &apos;m getting kind of hungry .
let &apos;s see .
i have been on six dates with three different people .
it was either for coffee or dinner .
one i met at a bookstore and two i met online .
i haven &apos;t slept with anyone .
the aquarium is 40 minutes away .
and there &apos;s a baggie of cheerios for you
in the glove compartment .
uh , regular or honey nut ?
i mixed them .
you mixed them .
no wonder gentleman callers are pounding down your door .
do you have any questions for me ?
just one .
are you doing okay ?
i am .
good .
i @-@ i want you to be happy .
i believe you .
i &apos;d believe you more if you threw a few apple jacks in here .
here you go .
thanks .
you got to be kidding me .
sorry ?
y @-@ you &apos;re elon musk .
环保跑车公司特斯拉tesla产品设计师
i am .
wh @-@ what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m washing dishes .
well , i was on the turkey line ,
but i got demoted for being too generous with the gravy .
oh , man . i ...
what an honor to meet you .
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m such a fan of tesla and spacex .
以及solarcity &#91; 专门发展家用光伏发电项目的公司 &#93; 的ceo
all your companies .
howard wolowitz , caltech .
nice to meet you , howard .
feels great to come down here and help the less fortunate , huh ?
oh , yeah .
nothing better than helping people .
which is something i realized
when i was viewing earth
from the deck of the international space station ,
where i spent two months as a payload specialist ,
a job i was qualified for
because i &apos;m an mit @-@ trained engineer .
and i thought i ladled the gravy on thick .
sorry . it &apos;s just ...
you &apos;re you , you know ?
and i really want you to adopt me .
well , you &apos;re here on thanksgiving ,
so you &apos;re probably a good person .
oh . i made my wife come down , too .
you think you might ever get back out to space ?
is that a job offer ? &apos; cause i really want to go to mars .
assuming i can bring my wife .
she hardly takes up any room .
she &apos;s basically a carry @-@ on .
well , we &apos;re not quite there yet ,
but we &apos;re always looking for engineers .
so let me give you my e @-@ mail . we can stay in touch .
thank you .
oh , look .
someone hardly touched their pumpkin pie .
want to share it with me ?
a @-@ a partially eaten piece of pumpkin pie
from a homeless shelter ?
with elon musk , you bet i do !
you know , for a thanksgiving buffet
in an aquarium cafeteria , that was really bad .
you &apos;re just upset &apos; cause they ran out of pilgrim hats .
they gave one to that baby . he wasn &apos;t even awake .
well , it wouldn &apos;t be a holiday without you being mad at a baby .
would you care to play an ocean @-@ themed game i invented ?
sure . what is it ?
it &apos;s called food , friend , fight .
one of us chooses three aquatic creatures ,
and the other one must decide which he would eat ,
befriend , or battle .
so it &apos;s like kiss , marry , kill .
what is that ?
it &apos;s a game where you &apos;re given three people
and you choose which one you &apos;d kiss , marry , or kill .
well , my game is better , &apos; cause instead of marrying someone ,
you get to eat them .
let &apos;s just play .
i &apos;ll start you off easy .
electric eel , pufferfish , shrimp .
well , i wouldn &apos;t fight the eel ,
because i know it can generate enough current to kill a horse .
so i &apos;d eat the eel ,
fight the shrimp ,
and befriend the pufferfish ,
because it would be nice to have company
on those days i feel bloated .
very well done .
thank you .
okay , your turn .
hmm . seal ,
hagfish ...
spongebob squarepants .
well , i &apos;d befriend spongebob but he &apos;s not real ,
so i can &apos;t do that , can i ?
but you can pal around with a hagfish ?
hey , let &apos;s not pull at that thread .
okay . i &apos;ll fight spongebob ,
because he &apos;s so friendly
we &apos;ll just end up tickling each other .
um , i &apos;ll befriend the seal ,
because he &apos;s trainable , which is the problem
i &apos;m having with my current friends .
which means i &apos;ll have to eat the hagfish .
isn &apos;t that gross ? i mean , a hagfish can produce
enough mucus to fill a bucket in a minute .
i know . it makes its own gravy-- it &apos;ll slide right down .
i miss this .
how can you miss a game
you &apos;ve never played before , silly ?
i guess sometimes i &apos;m silly .
hey . where &apos;d you go ? i can &apos;t tell if the turkey &apos;s done !
be right there !
hi , lover .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m sorry about the journal . i want to make it up to you .
so i &apos;m gonna let you post
a shame photo of me on facebook .
我这个淘气的胡萝卜
i am not putting that on the internet !
i don &apos;t want people to see this .
i don &apos;t want to see it !
don &apos;t want people to see what , huh ?
a little bit of this ?
some of this ?
and , since it &apos;s thanksgiving ,
an extra helping of this ?
happy thanks ...
i &apos;m glad you had a nice time with amy .
me , too . it &apos;s comforting to know
that she and i are able to function as friends .
well , i &apos;ve never been friends with any of my exes .
oh , i &apos;m sure you and leonard will be able to pull it off .
oh . it &apos;s my friend amy .
hello .
hi , sheldon .
i &apos;m just driving home from my mother &apos;s .
did you have a nice time ?
i did . um ...
listen , i really enjoyed spending this morning with you .
well , i can &apos;t take all the credit .
it was pretty funny when that one anchovy started going the wrong way .
it was .
uh , listen ,
i @-@ i was thinking that , um ,
maybe i &apos;m ready to be your girlfriend again .
i thought we were just friends .
we are .
but i was hoping , maybe ...
amy , i excel at many things ,
but getting over you wasn &apos;t one of them .
i think i need to just be your friend .
okay .
i understand .
good .
oh , i watched a video of the hagfish producing mucus ,
so i &apos;m gonna change my answer and eat spongebob .
okay . sure .
