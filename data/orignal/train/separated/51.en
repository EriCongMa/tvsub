Okay, a couple of things before we get started.
You are a witness appearing before a grand jury
in Cook County and not its target.
But you also have the right to have an attorney with you
to answer any questions that you might have.
Do you understand that?
Yes.
Please state your name for the record.
Blake Calamar.
That's C-A-L-A-M-A-R.
Have you and I ever met before?
Yes, uh, we have,
when you searched my apartment and threatened me.
Have we kissed and made up?
Not really.
Uh, but I intend to tell the truth here, anyway.
Because you've been granted immunity.
Well, I'd tell the truth either way,
but a little immunity never hurt.
Cary... where are you going with this?
I'm showing how he has knowledge of criminal activity.
They don't give a rat's ass.
Get on with it.
Where are you employed, Mr. Calamar?
Until recently,
I was employed at Lockhart/Gardner & Bond.
And you were brought there by Mr. Derrick Bond,
is that correct?
Yes.
And he was recently forced out.
By the other partners, uh, Diane Lockhart
and Will Gardner.
And you were also
in the employ of someone else while working in Chicago.
Yes. I did supply,
and still supply, support for Lemond Bishop.
And what is Mr. Bishop's business?
Well, he has several.
Uh... A string of dry cleaners,
uh, health clubs...
Isn't he also the top dealer of illegal drugs in Cook County?
I don't... know much about that.
And didn't you also work
for a time protecting his interests in prostitution?
I was a part of his security detail.
I just went where he told me.
And you brought his business to Lockhart/Gardner.
Yes. Yes, his... legal business.
Let's turn to the target of this grand jury.
How do you know her?
Kalinda Sharma?
Yes.
She's an investigator at Lockhart/Gardner.
This is where you were witness to her illegal activities.
Yes.
It's a new day.
You sound sarcastic.
No. That was me being genuine.
Bond is gone; Blake is gone...
so what's wrong?
What makes you think anything is wrong?
Ever get the feeling something bad is gonna happen?
All the time.
It's a vulnerable time... we need to make it look
like the loss of Bond makes us stronger, not weaker.
We cannot lose a single client.
It'll become a domino effect.
So meet with all your accounts...
If there's a hint of unhappiness, tell us,
and we'll fill the room.
All right, let's do it.
It's about a law firm with a sphere of influence.
Chicago and DC,
DC and Chicago.
No.
You know what it's about?
Being in the larger conference room.
Your business isn't confined to one city,
and neither should your law firm be.
What we see for you is, uh...
Mr. Bishop thank you for coming on in,
hearing from us.
No problem.
Derrick wanted me to go with him.
I know. I'll be honest.
We had a disagreement about the direction of the firm,
and we... we want to do everything we can to make you happy.
Are we happy, Dex?
We're getting there.
Well, good, because we're here for you.
That's good to know.
Because...
I do have something...
unusual...
...I have to ask of you.
And her.
Polling.
Look, Diane,
I'm in no danger of leaving you guys.
I never liked Bond, so don't...
Holy...!
Look at the comparison.
Uh, D-Diane, I gotta go.
No, no, no, no.
We-we just closed within a point of Wendy Scott-Carr.
Bye.
We're gonna win this.
Don't say it, damn it.
Go outside and come back in.
Nora! Get the DCC on the phone.
They're here.
They're here? Who's here?
Frank Landau.
Head of the Democratic Committee?
And the mountain comes to Muhammad.
Well, this should be fun.
Eli Gold.
Frank Landau.
You've met Matt Becker.
So, you did it... you got rid of Childs.
Well, Childs dropped out for family reasons.
We'll support you. We'll climb on board;
but we need a couple of guarantees first, from you and Peter.
We have a couple of people on Childs' staff,
we need to make sure they stay.
Wh-What are you doing?
Nothing. Go on.
You're not outsiders anymore, so...
Eli, what are you doing?
I'm lowering my pants.
Why?
To make it easier for you to kiss my ass.
You think I'll get a warmer welcome from Wendy?
I'm sure you will,
up until the day they get elected.
What do you want?
I'll think about it and give you a call.
Just to warn you, Mr. Bishop,
we need to be a bit cautious in the way we discuss
your more street-level holdings.
My wife is divorcing me.
I'm so sorry.
Thank you.
She had a divorce lawyer call.
I'm embarrassed to say...
I was surprised.
I love my wife.
I love my kids.
But my business sometimes takes me away from home.
Of course.
I hope we find some way to work this out.
It's better to be careful.
Yes.
And given the...
difficulties of my...
business...
a divorce may prove problematic.
Well, we are a full-service firm, sir.
We're in your corner.
Thank you.
Well, even drug dealers get divorced, too.
Alicia, you work with David Lee on this.
Got it.
So, politics is the politics,
but the business of this office still continues.
And don't worry,
all-all salary and job commitments will be honored.
For the lucky few.
You care to share that, Geneva, with everybody?
Sure. The new state's attorney cleans house... you know that.
No. I mean, whoever wins, the budget crisis is so extreme,
they can't start over.
And everybody in this room
has a commitment from this office, either way.
You're a survivor, aren't you, Geneva?
Are you telling me that none of those sick days from last month
were spent interviewing?
Go back to work, people.
You're wrong about one thing.
Not everybody in this room has a commitment.
Well, your salary bump is in the works.
It's moving slowly.
Well, let's get it moving fast.
I want friends in this office, Cary.
I'm not gonna screw you over.
Just don't screw me over.
His businesses aren't doing well.
Bishop... his business... it's been hurt by the economy.
Yeah, his legal business.
Oh, it's all right.
I'm trying to drink less.
Since when?
My daughter... she thinks I drink too much.
You know what your problem is?
I don't drink enough?
You didn't get your tubes tied.
Here.
I saw you get this upstairs... what is it?
Go ahead.
Oh, my God.
Yep. It's my grand jury subpoena.
Kalinda, why are you being so calm?
I'm not.
It's just it's been a long time coming.
What has?
State's attorney thinks too many people leak to me.
But... Kalinda, this is for Wednesday.
You need to call a lawyer.
Yeah, I did.
Who?
You.
Hey. Jimmy Patrick back with you.
Jesus was black.
There goes another Sunday school lesson down the drain.
All those preachers saying Jesus was as white as Billy Graham...
Nope. Sorry.
You see this skin? He was darker than me.
Middle-Eastern.
That's right, the Son of God
looked like Chris Rock, not Lance Armstrong.
What this office needs is a breath of fresh air,
and that's why I support Wendy Scott-Carr for state's attorney.
You're watching the live coverage...
You need to change your campaign strategy, Eli.
You know it.
We were never gonna get him anyway.
Doesn't matter. Look at the polling.
You're not counting the youth vote.
I am counting the youth votes.
Wendy's got the black vote and the liberal whites.
You need blue-collar whites.
Oh, you mean the racist whites?
Your politics is getting in the way of your polling.
You need blue-collar whites, soccer moms,
you need to start pushing a new message:
"Bring back the old Chicago."
Why not "Save our neighborhoods"?
Sure.
Although I know you think that's... too obvious and unhip.
And racist.
They're votes.
You don't cater to them, they sit this one out,
and you lose by one point.
Read the projections.
Go ahead. You need to take the black faces off the Web site.
Put Peter on the dais with white suburbanites,
and stop doing photo ops south of 47th.
So, what are you going to do, Eli?
Look at me.
I made a mistake.
I said I'm sorry.
That doesn't change anything.
You slept with her.
She didn't mean anything.
I'm in love with you.
You don't cheat on the person you're in love with.
I said it won't happen again.
It will happen again.
Because the easiest thing in the world is for you to say
it won't happen again.
I'll go to counseling.
Let's just ask these lawyers to leave.
No. Let's start.
We suggest mediation...
one veto apiece for mediators.
At alternating sites?
You mean, your mother's living room?
We rent space from a law firm in the Loop.
How nice for you. Can I have one of your cards?
I imagine you're too new to be in the phone book.
Thank you.
What do you want, Mr. Bishop?
I want her not to leave me.
The best way to put out a fire is to starve it of oxygen.
In a divorce, oxygen is money.
If she doesn't get your money, she won't leave.
Whatever you need to do.
I guess it's sweet: a drug kingpin in love.
She really had a hard time finding a lawyer.
This guy's barely out of law school.
It's not the safest thing for him to do,
helping her divorce Bishop.
Where's Kalinda? I thought she was checking into his finances.
His dry cleaners, health clubs, gas stations...
they're all on the verge of Chapter 11.
He's propping them up with his other income.
Good. Let her try to go after his drug trade.
That's a battle I am prepared to win.
No matter what, you plead the Fifth.
Kalinda, the only way that this works
and the only reason I agreed to be your lawyer
was you do as I say.
They get you talking, they win.
You defend yourself, they win.
Okay.
The questions are devised to make you look bad,
so no matter, you say...?
I refuse to answer on the grounds it may incriminate me.
Good.
Now, a Chicago grand jury will indict a ham sandwich.
Don't say a thing; don't make their job easier.
Kalinda... what's going on?
I can't help you unless I know.
It's about Blake.
Dr. Booth from last year.
The psychologist from our pharmaceutical win?
Yeah.
Blake broke into his office and beat him up.
That's how we won.
He tried to set me up by leaving my fingerprints on a glass.
Why is Blake doing this?
He's not a very good person.
I don't want to pry, but you have to trust me.
I do trust you.
More than usual.
Um, I'm not, um...
It's not in my nature to talk, Alicia.
I'm not hiding anything.
Can you keep me out of jail?
I'm home!
Oh, Pastor Isaiah.
Are you waiting for my dad?
Yes.
I'm Grace.
I know. Hello.
Do you think Jesus was black?
Do I?
Yeah.
He was dark-skinned, being a Middle-Eastern Jew.
Doesn't it make you mad when people make him white?
I think people always want to see Jesus as looking like them.
But isn't that bad?
Sometimes. Sometimes not.
Do you believe in global warming?
Yes. I do.
Do you?
Yeah, and what about politics?
Are you a Democrat?
I try not to answer that question.
Yeah, but you're an African-American,
so it makes sense to be a Democrat.
I think a lot of things that make sense aren't always true.
I am ending this call.
Pastor Isaiah, I'm so sorry.
Peter asked me to tell you that he can't make it today.
Ah.
Hi.
Hi.
We were just talking.
How nice.
Do you think Jesus was black?
We thought he's black, or dark-skinned.
He was a Middle-Eastern Jew, so it makes sense.
Sure. He must have been something, right?
Could you, um, excuse us for a moment, please, Grace?
I like talking to you.
I like talking to you.
Peter asked me to say that,
for the last few weeks of the campaign,
I'll need him full-time, so could he have a rain check on
your spiritual guidance days?
Is that what Peter wants?
It's just for the last few weeks of the campaign.
Oh, and the prayer breakfast.
My mistake. We have a scheduling conflict.
Peter's making a speech at his son's school.
You understand.
I think I do.
It's just until the election.
After that, the schedule starts to loosen up.
I'm sure it will.
Good-bye, Pastor!
Good-bye, Grace.
Welcome to mediation, everybody.
I'm your mutually agreed upon mediator.
My name is Frederick Medkiff. Please call me Fred.
And I want to assure both sides that I'm here to help you reach
a yes.
You're kidding me.
This is crazy.
You expect us to believe Mr. Bishop is almost broke?
You can believe what you want, but he is actually almost broke.
Before we move to specifics, let's share a few thoughts
on what we want to get.
I helped you build up that business, Lemond.
I put my life on hold so you could build it.
And what business would that be, ma'am?
Oh, come on.
If she goes to jail for it, he goes to jail, too.
Uh, I'm sorry. Was that a threat?
You want a threat? Here's a threat.
Wait, wait, wait. Did he just say what I think he just said?
You can go to hell, and this whole stupid...
And is he really threatening me with jail time?
I see no need for any harsh language here at all.
Now, it's not wrong to express feelings,
but let's all take a breath.
You owe me half.
Half of what? Half of Chapter 11?
We'd like to call a witness.
It's our right.
I work for the anti-gang division
of the Illinois office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Come on. Now you're kidding.
And you've been following Mr. Bishop's
activities for how long now?
Five years.
Mr. Bishop.
Agent Hemings.
Can you give us a recent valuation
of Mr. Bishop's illegal drug activity?
Acknowledging that it's merely the deepest conjecture
from a man who would arrest my client if he had any proof.
We have no subpoena power here, Mr. Lee.
No court reporter, no transcripts.
This is purely a mediation.
This input will help me determine a fair settlement.
Our last estimate, we put the valuation
of Mr. Bishop's drug trade at $88 million.
Oh, come on. Now you're dreaming.
The FBI doesn't dream, Mr. Lee.
Oh, really?
What were you doing on September 11?
That was not us. That was the CIA.
Oh, it was the CIA, was it?
Yeah, the CIA. Ignored incredible intel.
You know, it's in the history books.
Have you read the 911 report?
And you've kept the books for how long, Mr. Roja?
Uh, about three years.
Uh... but I wouldn't call them exactly books, you know.
I-I keep count.
And is $88 million a correct valuation?
I wish! I mean, that...
that may be what the FBI sees coming in,
but there's breakage.
You know, how much product and cash just walks out of the door.
We have payments that we have to make regularly.
Never mind.
And the economy?
Yeah, you would think this economy would be good for us,
but a lot of our high-end customers are pulling back
or finding different avenues.
I mean, there's still some street level,
but then there's the trickle-down effect.
What do you estimate then?
Uh, I don't know.
Uh... three million a year gross.
Oh, come on.
You calling me a liar?
Dexter, you don't really believe...
You know, Kat, seriously...
Please!
Shut up!
No. I'm gonna call you on your bluff.
Mrs. Bishop is not walking away with one million dollars.
Well, then, let's go to court.
They both end up in prison.
Your client doesn't want that.
My client doesn't want Mrs. Bishop to have a cent.
He's in love, and people in love do desperate things.
Oh, is that a threat?
It's a fact.
You don't realize.
Mrs. Bishop has the kids,
and she doesn't have to go to court to keep him from the kids.
That's what I call a threat.
Yeah. Tell Mr. Bishop to come up with a number.
A million bucks on the table,
and she threatens him with the kids.
Find out why she's going scorched earth.
Okay.
What was that about?
Another case.
Are you comfortable?
I am.
I see you have availed yourself of an attorney, Miss Sharma.
I would warn her, per Illinois statute,
you may consult with her,
but she may not speak at these proceedings.
Is that understood?
It is.
How long have you worked at Lockhhart/Gardner?
I refuse to answer on the grounds that it may incriminate me.
I see. That's how we're gonna handle this?
As is Miss Sharma's right.
We ask that the state's attorney accept
a blanket statement of Fifth Amendment protection.
Let me ask that Mrs. Florrick remain silent.
Did you beat the psychologist... Dr. Booth?
I refuse to answer on the grounds that it may incriminate me.
Were you ordered by your superior, Mr. Will Gardner,
to beat Dr. Booth?
I refuse to answer on the grounds that it may incriminate me.
Were you ordered by your superior, Diane Lockhart,
to beat Dr. Booth?
I refuse to answer on the grounds that it may incriminate me.
But it makes sense
that you would only act at the behest of your superiors.
I refuse to answer on the grounds that it may incriminate me.
Would you care to share that note
with the rest of us, Miss Sharma?
It's attorney-client work product,
so we politely decline.
Is there a systematic plan
at Lockhart/Gardner to break the law when pursuing cases?
I refuse to answer on the grounds that it may incriminate me.
He can't be coming after us.
Childs is a lame duck.
That's exactly when he would be coming after us.
He doesn't have to deal with the political heat.
Oh, could still be about me.
Overcharging at the grand jury.
No. Childs is communicating through us to you two.
That's the only reason he hauled Kalinda in...
so we'd hear their questions.
So, what's the next step?
Grand jury is questioning their star witness again.
Blake.
Blake.
What is this?
Maybe you should talk to him.
Blake.
Maybe you should.
Tell me about your dad. Anything that comes to mind.
My dad's my best friend.
Oh.
He takes me to school.
We play baseball.
And he showed me how to make sloppy Joes.
The secret's brown sugar.
Brown sugar. Sounds delicious.
So, dads can be fun, huh?
You feel like you can count on your dad?
Uh-huh. One time, I ate a peanut.
I was in the hospital for three days.
My dad slept in my room.
What happened the last time you had a birthday...
what'd you do?
For my birthday, Mom and Dad, they got a ice cream truck,
and I could have as much as I wanted.
Dylan, what is your dad's job?
He's a businessman.
Have you ever seen your dad on TV?
I don't think that's relevant.
It is if you're making a custody determination.
Dylan, what did you see on TV?
I saw this man.
He said my dad did bad things.
But my dad, he said it was a mistake.
He said not to watch.
What else did the man say about your dad?
Enough.
Enough.
Mr. Bishop, your lawyers will have their chance.
No.
Dylan...
you don't have to answer any more questions.
Was I bad?
No. No, you could never be bad.
I'll talk to Mommy.
$21 million and joint custody.
You don't want me to take that back to him.
Then let's bring his kid back in for questioning again.
How can she do that?
Do what?
Put her son up there like that.
She doesn't want to.
That's why she has me.
Tell him $21 million
and he'll have joint custody.
What's going on? You find out anything?
She's having an affair.
With who, the lawyer?
I don't know.
She has a meeting arranged this weekend
at a Rolling Crest Suites in Lake Forest... room 333.
That would explain why he's fighting so hard.
Bishop doesn't know yet, does he?
I don't think so.
But it's only a matter of time.
Everything all right?
I think I've just been cured of love.
Oh, no, it's not her.
Lawyers have a way of making things... ugly.
If there's one thing I've learned in my business:
lawyers don't act on their own.
Wait!
One second!
Have you met Zach's girlfriend?
Yeah, why?
She's black.
Becca?
No. Nisa.
Who's Nisa?
Zach's girlfriend.
Since when?
November.
She's really sweet.
I think her dad's from, like, Somalia or something.
But her mom lives here.
Zach's gonna bring her to Dad's speech at school.
He really wants Dad to meet her.
And...
I met this really nice guy on line.
Jimmy Patrick. He's black, too.
Okay, you're making this up now.
No, I'm not.
The Florrick children just really love black people.
You kids are evil!
Mr. Gardner.
Why are you doing this?
What?
Grand jury.
What do you want?
Why do you think I want anything?
Look, I've been granted immunity.
I gotta tell the truth.
Kalinda didn't hurt that doctor.
You know we didn't order anything.
That's not really true.
You told me to go kneecap him.
I'm guessing you told Kalinda the same thing.
That's what you're hanging your hat on, huh?
An inept metaphor?
I don't work in metaphors.
It's kind of like at your old firm...
I was told to cover up your theft.
Okay, now you're getting in dangerous territory.
I remember using a lot of metaphors back then.
I was your "Life preserver."
I was your, uh, "Ace in the hole."
We agree.
I paid my debt.
I've been subpoenaed.
I gotta answer honestly.
But you didn't want the kids involved in the campaign.
And they're not.
Um, Peter is speaking at Zach's school.
That's right.
I don't think you quite realize
how Zach could be involved in this story.
You said you didn't want them involved,
and I am trying to honor that.
Okay.
Thank you.
How are you doing?
I hear it's a new day here.
It is.
And Peter, too.
He's winning.
It'll still be close; it's Chicago.
Do you know where you'll live?
Where I'll...?
After the election.
You'll be able to afford more.
Move out of the apartment
and get back to where you were before.
I just got a call.
The grand jury?
No. Cary.
That's our deal.
You do know that I'm an attorney with Lockhart/Gardner.
We do know that.
It's a deal we'd advise Kalinda to take.
We have a witness who can nail Kalinda
for putting Dr. Booth into a coma.
Two years minimum. On the other hand,
you testify against Lockhart/Gardner,
we'll grant you full immunity.
You lost. Get over it.
Mrs. Florrick is incorrect in thinking
this is about her husband's campaign.
I've not made it about her husband's campaign.
In fact... I have been meticulous
in keeping the two separate.
Kalinda Sharma, on the other hand,
has a decision to make.
Turn evidence against the law firm
or get indicted and serve two years.
Hi, Mrs. Florrick.
Hi, Nisa. How's everything at school?
Good.
My parents aren't happy about the shorter Fridays.
Nobody is.
They're starting a petition, if you want to sign.
Sure.
Dad's coming to campus Monday. Are you coming?
I can't. I have to work.
But, Zach, I need to talk to you for a minute.
The press may want to ask you a few questions on campus.
I don't want to get you involved,
so I'll ask Dad not to point you out either, okay?
Okay. Nobody will care, though.
I know, but I'll care.
I haven't wanted you guys involved in this.
Eli asked you to talk to him, didn't he?
No one's talking to you.
Hey, but this is not about Zach.
It's about his girlfriend.
Grace...
Eli doesn't want anybody involved who's black.
I told him that Zach has an African-American girlfriend.
That's why he talked to you, right?
This is about Nisa?
No... I don't know.
That is... so wrong.
You should tell Eli off.
Okay, both of you just calm down.
What can I tell Nisa?
Nisa, can you stay for dinner?
I don't know. I'll call my mom.
Okay.
What's up?
Eli, we need to talk. Drop by my office tomorrow.
The house in Lincoln Park,
the summer home in Boca Raton,
titled in her name;
spousal support of $100,000 a month
till the children reach majority,
and shared custody.
I think it's too generous, but there you go.
We'll pass.
Well, do you have a counter?
Vastly improved numbers for starters.
As I think we've now established,
Mr. Bishop's financial resources are apparently limitless.
She gets primary custody.
He can see his kids two weekends a month.
The offer is not going to improve.
We'll see what a court has to say.
Katrina, this is not a good idea.
Please... talk to me, not my client.
And down the rabbit hole we go.
The judicial process will take over now.
The good news is that your wife is hosed financially.
Your legitimate businesses are worthless on paper.
And now that we're out of mediation,
we'll be able to preclude mention of any assets
that could lead to criminal exposure.
And my son...
at trial...
will he have to testify?
Thank you.
You crossed the line.
Which one?
You don't want Zach being seen with his black girlfriend?
It's not what I want.
Polling shows Peter will lose
if we don't have the blue collar and the suburban vote.
And they don't like black girlfriends?
They don't like people they can't relate to.
It makes you look too... cosmopolitan.
You don't know what voters want or think or anything.
You just make this stuff up
based on whatever biases
you have swirling around in your head at that moment.
I wish that were true.
Well, you know what's true?
Zach is going to Peter's speech with Nisa.
Do you know how crazy this is?
For the last six months, I've been asking you
to let me put the kids in front of the cameras,
and you have said no...
until I want them not in front of the cameras,
and now you want the opposite.
Yeah, Eli, it's all about you.
We're the next case up.
I'm sorry mediation has failed you, Mr. Bishop.
Oh, you did your best.
I hope it hasn't soured you on the need for compromise.
I always tell myself,
"Say a yes for every time you say a no and you'll be a happier person""
Y-You understand what I mean.
No.
Well, I guess what I mean is,
if we can all work together, toward the same goals,
each in our own way, then everyone can feel like they had a...
You killed her.
You did it.
What?
She O.D.'d last night.
She's been clean for ten years
and what, she just decided to start using again?
Oh, my God.
Okay, where did you hear this?
You did it. You killed her.
I'd watch my words, friend.
I didn't touch her.
But you get everything now, right?
I mean, you get full custody.
And you get the cash.
Okay, let's take this out of the hall.
You're a murderer.
Stop this now.
Don't say another word.
Did you have something else you'd like to share?
Good.
You ready?
No matter what they ask... the Fifth.
You plead the Fifth.
Got it.
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
I do.
Now, we've asked Blake Calamar back for another day of questioning,
but you have no disagreement with his characterization of the conversation?
I refuse to answer on the grounds that it may incriminate me.
Again, we would speed things up here
if you allowed for a blanket pleading of the Fifth.
And again, we would ask that Miss Sharma's attorney
honor the Illinois state statute.
Mr. Calamar testified that you beat Dr. Booth with a bat.
And then you gave that weapon to him to hide.
Is that true?
I refuse to answer on the grounds that it may incriminate me.
You then, according to Mr. Calamar,
took that same bat back from him
after knocking him unconscious. Is that true?
I refuse to answer on the grounds that it may incriminate me.
And since that time,
have you ever tried to contact Mr. Calamar?
Can you ask me that again, please?
Why, certainly, Miss Sharma.
I asked, "Since that time,
have you ever tried to contact Mr. Calamar?"
Yes.
I'd like to speak to my client.
No, Mrs. Florrick.
Your client wishes to answer the question.
Go ahead.
I tried to speak to him a few days ago.
I followed him to the hotel, but he was meeting someone.
And this hotel where you followed him?
What hotel was that?
It was a Lake... um...
It was, uh, Rolling Crest Suites in Lake Forest.
Uh... room 333.
You said you tried to speak to Mr. Calamar.
So what prevented you?
I saw that Mr. Calamar was meeting
with an African- American woman,
so I did not contact him.
And why did you try to contact him?
'Cause I wanted to ask him
why he was lying about me to a grand jury.
And if... if I was this grand jury,
I would be asking him the same questions.
My guess is Mr. Calamar won't even return here
after he hears my testimony.
Did you really just do what I think you did?
What do you think I just did?
Suggested that Blake was the one sleeping with Bishop's wife.
Look, the lighting at the Rolling Crest Suites was so dark,
it could've been Blake.
Alicia Florrick.
This is Cary Agos.
How is your day going?
Fine, Cary. How's yours?
Ah, I think I got a cold coming on.
Well, I'm really sorry to hear that.
Another subpoena?
Well, oddly, no.
Blake Calamar, during his last visit to the grand jury,
was asked some follow-up questions
based on Miss Sharma's testimony,
and you'll just never guess what happened.
I think I have an idea.
He asked for a brief recess,
and didn't return to the grand jury room.
Now, he's our only witness against Miss Sharma,
so for now, we will not need her to return.
Thank you, Cary. I'll let her know.
Do.
How are you, Cary?
I don't know.
May be tough sledding here for a while.
Well, good luck.
Thank you.
Look at you.
Your daughter's not going to be very happy with you.
No. She thinks I drink too much wine.
This is tequila.
Cary was in on it, wasn't he?
He knew what to ask you.
Cary's a great guy.
Oh, listen to you.
You and Cary, sitting in a tree...
Hey, I'm just shoring up friends.
For what?
For the end days.
I have to buy a big house.
You have to?
For appearances. I don't know.
I have to stop life from just happening, don't I?
I don't want to buy a big house.
I like my apartment.
Yeah, I like it too.
I used to have so many friends.
Where are they now?
Now you lost me.
Back then, my old life, the big house?
I had all these...
mom friends.
All talking about our weight.
Yeah, I wish I knew you back then.
No.
I was... different.
We would've hated each other.
Life changes, doesn't it?
Yeah, it does.
We can change it back.
We can do what we want.
Who's that?
Blake.
You're kidding.
Nope. He wants to meet.
Well, you're not going to.
Kalinda...
Hey, slugger.
I heard you were heading home.
Yeah, yeah, thanks for that.
I felt you needed a little encouragement.
Yeah, well, having Bishop
after you for sleeping with his wife, that's...
that's encouraging.
Don't be a sore loser.
Well, I...
I finally got Leela.
You finally got her.
Yeah, I finally understood.
Well, good for you.
It's a little bit too late, though, isn't it?
Not really.
Met with an ASA this afternoon...
one last interview to fill them in.
What do you want, a medal?
You see, I thought it was about why.
Why you changed your name.
I thought there was some deep, dark secret in your past,
but there really wasn't.
You just got bored with your old life.
Yep, that's me, boring as they come.
But then I realized it wasn't about why.
It was about who.
Who helped you change your name?
'Cause I was looking for clues out there,
and there were none, and it was odd.
Then I realized that was the clue.
Could we speed this up?
See, someone helped you cover up the clues.
The biggest clue of all ended up being you, though.
You have a tell.
We into tells now?
You overreact.
So I thought back to all the times you overreacted.
When I told Alicia about Leela,
you destroyed my car.
When I asked you what Alicia knew,
you went psycho.
Alicia. It's about Alicia.
That's what you care about.
Go home.
Peter helped you change your name
at the state's attorney's office, when you worked there.
Peter helped you change your name.
And then you slept with him.
Peter covered up everything for you.
For Leela.
And you... slept with him.
You're wrong.
That's good.
Because I told the ASA,
and of course, you know, they have their process.
They'll probably...
probably interview everyone involved and...
they'll get it all straightened out.
