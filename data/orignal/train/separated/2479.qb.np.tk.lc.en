please welcome the springfield atomettes .
now , for this routine ,
we need the help of a junior atomette .
they &apos;re picking me , dad .
don &apos;t call me &quot; dad . &quot;
if people think peanut vendors have families ,
it &apos;s too sad .
looks like we &apos;ve got a volunteer ...
right there .
look , while i &apos;d like to help ,
i &apos;m kind of pessimistic about the team &apos;s chances .
they &apos;re gonna get creamed .
go , go , go !
i &apos;m dating a cheerleader .
no , you &apos;re not .
burned again , milhouse .
wow , that was great .

great job , ladies .

which should just about cover your parking .
i can &apos;t believe he pays you so little .
the crowd was crazy about you .
i know , but what are we gonna do about it ?
if we pipe up they &apos;ll put us in the mascot costume .
after you wear that , you need to be hosed down for bedbugs .
good game , everyone . i never dreamed
a night where you discovered i was cheating
and beat the crap out of me could end on such an up note .
see you next week .
homer .
hmm ? hey , gretchen .
i had your jacket cleaned .
good as new . and thanks for loaning me
your sweater for the ride home .
it may be a little stretched out .
geez , that was a pregnancy sweater .
so , you want to hold little homer ?
wow , so now there &apos;s two things named after me--
a baby , and a law banning air horns after 3 : 00 a.m.
aw that &apos;s sweet .
read &apos; em and weep .
the novels of charlotte bronte .
um , i thought we were playing cards .
i was just driving by
with some baby stuff we didn &apos;t need
and , uh , well , here &apos;s some diapers maggie &apos;s too big for ,
and an incredible educational toy i forgot to give bart.
thanks . hey , could you babysit for an hour ?
i &apos;ve been alone with the baby for days .

* baby , baby , please let me hold him *
where &apos;s hoju ?
where &apos;s hoju ?
where &apos;s hoju ?
where &apos;s hoju ?
where &apos;s hoju ? !
itchy and scratchy show .
* a child arrived just the other day *
* he came to the world in the usual way *
* but there were planes to catch *
* and bills to pay *
* he learned to walk while i was away *
* and he was talking &apos; fore i knew it *
* and as he grew *
* he &apos;d say , &quot; i &apos;m gonna be like you , dad &quot; *
* &quot; you know i &apos;m gonna be like you &quot; *
* and the cat &apos;s in the cradle ... *
kids blow up so fast .
oh ! homie ?
aw , you &apos;re shopping ahead for maggie .
oh , no , i &apos;m shopping for homer jr . ,
a baby i delivered in an elevator
the night i pretended to go to work
but was really playing poker .
what ? !
this simulation has been brought to you by your brain ,
a subsidiary of your penis .
oh , yes , i &apos;m shopping for maggie
our baby together ,
so this looks perfectly innocent .
why are you saying that ?
oh , you know how the first few weeks are :
sleep deprived , walking around in a fog .
first few weeks of what ?
um , november .
hey , atomette .
i want to say ... caitlin ?
lisa . guys , do you realize you &apos;re being exploited by this team ?
wha ... ?
they sell your posters ,
workout dvds ,
and all of your practices
are broadcast on a webcam .
and some of the angles
are low .
but don &apos;t worry , collective bargaining
will enable us to secure concessions .
uh , we &apos;re gonna push &apos; em back ,
push &apos; em back , push &apos; em way , way back .
all the way to a new contract .
&apos;cause union power is a fact .
and we &apos;re ...
okay , okay , we get it .
well , look who &apos;s here .
you been hit by the cheerleading bug , little lady ?
actually , i &apos;ve been hit by the unfair labor practices bug .
what ? why , that &apos;s samuel gompers talk .
now , little missy , the only thing you should be organizin&apos;
is your dollies .
how ? by size , brand , value ?
and don &apos;t even suggest race , &apos; cause i don &apos;t see that .
i just see little people i own .
what do you say , ladies ?
not right , not fair .
let &apos;s say it with our hair .
okay , fine .
i &apos;m gonna give it some thought ,
then say no in the nicest way possible .
no .
oh , good .
nice .
&quot; beat dallas . &quot;
can never argue with that .
hey , ladies . my vest isn &apos;t the only thing that &apos;s ripped .
i am in the market for a backup mistress . possibly two .
have you kids seen your father ?
surprised he &apos;s not here ogling these girls .
he said he was going to work .
on a friday afternoon ?
i bet he &apos;s playing poker again .
coming through .
wife on a mission .
go , fight , win .
marge .
wow , i &apos;ve never burst through a banner before ,
but it really does the trick .
homer , i know you &apos;re here .
your car &apos;s outside .
where is he ?
i honestly don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m just teaching myself massage here with online videos
and a store mannequin .
oh , i &apos;m so sorry .
so , do you have any injuries i should know about ?
hmm , if he &apos;s not in there , where is he ?
oh , baby .
oh , baby , shake it . homer like .
shake it . now , roll over on your tummy ,
just like i taught you .
tell me what a cow says .
aah ! my other baby mama .
so this is where you &apos;ve been going .
another woman &apos;s apartment .
marge , it &apos;s not what you think .
quiet . you &apos;re upsetting homer jr .
you have a baby together ?
oh , it &apos;s cool .
we did it in an elevator .
i &apos;m a schwarzenegger wife .
but you &apos;re also the housekeeper , so it &apos;s all good .
it &apos;s not good .
none of it &apos;s good .
i haven &apos;t had a drink for a week .
that is pretty good .
so then you delivered her baby
right there in the elevator .
it &apos;s true .
even the other guy in the elevator-- he &apos;s right here .
and the really funny thing is i &apos;m a doctor .
well , i &apos;m glad you did a good deed ,
but you shouldn &apos;t come here again .
i thought that was strange poop on your collar .
good @-@ bye , homer jr .
i guess you &apos;re the man of the house now .
and never forget ,
even though the mortgage is due on the first ,
you can usually wait till the 17th .
you know what ?
i think it &apos;s fine if homer spends a few hours
now and then with ...
homer jr .
exactly .
you always said charity begins at home .
but not which home .
it &apos;s true , i never specified the home .
春田原子能队vs谢尔比维尔鲨鱼队
* there &apos;s a great and a bloody fight *
* round this whole world tonight *
* and the battle , the bombs and shrapnel reign *
* hitler told the world around *
* he would tear our union down *
* but our union &apos;s gonna break them slavery chains *
* our union &apos;s gonna break them slavery chains *
无钱无甜 给我 &quot; m &quot; 给我 &quot; i &quot; 给我最少工资 给合理工资要不不干
* i walked up on a mountain in the middle of the sky *
* could see every farm and every town *
* i could see all the people in this whole wide world *
* that &apos;s the union that &apos;ll tear the fascists down , down , down . *
now to sing you a lullaby my father sung to me .
sleep , sleep , sleep , sleep , sleep
sleep , sleep , sleep , sleep , sleep , sleep , sleep .
oh , man , i really overdid it tonight .
late night at moe &apos;s , eh ?
no , i &apos;m exhausted from
head , shoulders , knees and toes , knees and toes .
it &apos;s the toes that get you , marge .
it &apos;s the toes .
what about your own children ?
way ahead of you , marge , i &apos;m taking all four
of my kids to the zoo tomorrow .
three .
yes , we &apos;ll be back by 3 : 00 .
homer has a very tight nap schedule .
quit talking about that baby .
i was talking about myself in the third person .
we can &apos;t take much more of this , lisa .
the girls are getting so antsy they &apos;ll cheer anything .
you &apos;re the greatest generation ,
worthy of our veneration .
go grampa !
if this is heaven , why don &apos;t my shoes match ?
okay , i give up .
i &apos;m gonna do what we secretly did at the alamo--
战争以墨西哥总统投降结束 之后德克萨斯成为美利坚第28个州
surrender .
while you &apos;re at it , how about a little boost
for peanut vendors ?
what do you think i &apos;m taking their raise out of ?
悲伤版之我家买了一个动物园
i wanted you all to be happy together ,
so i brought you to the zoo
where all the animals live in harmony .
okay , guys , i got your ice creams .
now , maggie , we don &apos;t hurt each other in this family .
are you nuts ?
you can &apos;t even kiss me good night without slicing me
with your stubble .
why you little ...
i &apos;ll give you a good @-@ night kiss you &apos;ll never forget .
come here , you .
dad , we &apos;re missing the giant capybaras of uruguay .
okay , i know what &apos;ll cheer you kids up .
seeing me out @-@ monkey the monkeys .
i have a soul and you guys don &apos;t .
aah ! monkeys !
dad , maggie &apos;s rolling away .
she &apos;s heading for prairie dog village .
if they get her in their warrens ,
we &apos;ll never see her again .
look , shiny keys .
jingle jangle .
stupid monkeys .
that &apos;s it , maggie , use the dino @-@ wand .
this is the last time you &apos;ll see that elevator baby .
i &apos;m sorry , homer jr .
you &apos;ll occupy an idealized place in my heart
that no one can ever quite fill .
therapy , please .
me , too .
okay , i &apos;ve got to impart all my fatherly advice
in this one walk .
the sky is blue , but nobody really knows why .
don &apos;t believe what they tell you .
girls are great and terrible at the same time .
get used to it .
and , most importantly ... oops , we &apos;re here .
you &apos;ll have to figure it out on your own .
sorry , little fella . one day i &apos;ll be that guy
who comes to your wedding , makes you feel a little weird ,
and then runs away .
homer , great news .
chase came back .
who &apos;s chase ?
homer jr . &apos; s father .
oh , my god , is that my son ?
you didn &apos;t tell me he was a soldier .
you didn &apos;t tell me you were pregnant .
i didn &apos;t want you to marry me because i was pregnant .
i wanted you to marry me because i was nagging you .
um , he likes it if you tickle his toes .
dude , he &apos;s my kid . he likes what i like .
but n @-@ n @-@ n @-@ nurture .
gretch , i think he &apos;s got my calves .
he does , baby , he does .
can i just say good @-@ bye to him quick ?
sure .
i guess this is it , little guy .
da @-@ da .
the most beautiful words a father can hear .
da @-@ da . da @-@ da .
hey , one day you &apos;ll have kids of your own .
i do .
really ? then this is much creepier than i thought .
much .
shouldn &apos;t have bet his door if he didn &apos;t want to lose it .
hi , maggie . if you could talk ,
i know you &apos;d have a few choice words for me .
you want me to take care of your dolly ?
that &apos;s the sweetest thing any baby has ever done for me .
honey , you know where the bottle opener is ?
i think it &apos;s in the drawer .
whoa , little dude .
where did you learn that ?
this is what we &apos;re fighting for , babe .
