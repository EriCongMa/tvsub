ten year anniversary of living together .

we &apos;re going to have an anniversary party .

you cut me !
well , happy anniversary !
i gotta get a tourniquet .

yeah !
well , it wasn &apos;t as bad as paper .
happy anniversary !
paper !
party time , man .
did you know that
the chemical symbol for tin is sn ?
schmidt and nick .
what ?
is no one else &apos;s mind blown by this ?
that &apos;s it , our theme is tinfinity .
tinfinity . that &apos;s actually really good , schmidt .
yeah , it is .
although i really don &apos;t think two men who
live together for ten years need a party .
why must you always be like this ?
because you never let me participate in the planning .
i would love for you to participate .
gah ! that was a trick . i was trying to get out of it .
they &apos;re celebrating ten years of living together ?
why are we friends with these guys , jess ?
i ...
what happened ?
it &apos;s so weird to think
that nick is the last person i kissed .
actually , schmidt &apos;s the last person i kissed .
okay , what ?
it was nothing . nick was watching .
what is happening in this loft ?
ooh , girls chatting .
hey , nick .
i wish i knew what was going on
inside nick &apos;s head .
he &apos;s like , grumpy mystery .
jess , are these open for anybody ?
yep .
right on , thank you .
he can &apos;t communicate a feeling to save his life .
but why can &apos;t i stop thinking
about his mouth on my mouth ?
hey , jess ,
do i have frosting on my lips ?
look at my mouth-- do i have frosting on it ?
wh @-@ why are you asking me this ?
my mouth feels moist and weird .
do i have anything on it ?
get out of here !
okay , you know what ?
you need what i needed .
you need a new guy , all right ?
dating shivrang helped me
get past all the weird stuff with schmidt .
i need the anti @-@ nick .
yeah .
i need a real man ,
who can express his feelings ,
and i need a different mouth on my mouth .
to erase that mouth .
no , you actually don &apos;t need to wash raw denim .
haven &apos;t washed my pants in 18 months .
also , i &apos;m bisexual .
microchips be gettin &apos; small .
they be , like , blueberry size .
so you could put &apos; em in your cereal , girl .
i don &apos;t get your thing .
it &apos;s prescription .
damn it .
what happened to the guys in this bar ?
they open up a bus station next door ?
where are the real men ?
i can &apos;t talk right now .
i &apos;m writing a strongly @-@ worded e @-@ mail to my florist .
guys , guys , guys , guys , guys ,
guys , guys , look at the door , don &apos;t look at the door ,
look right now , don &apos;t look , one at a time ,
look , but don &apos;t look . guys , one at a time .
don &apos;t look now .
look . no , you &apos;re both looking .
i don &apos;t know what to do .
i &apos;m confused .
look right now at the door . go .
that is a strapping young man .
that is jax mctavish .
he plays safety for san francisco .
why &apos;s he with winston ?
winston looks so cool .
what up , guys ?
oh , &quot; what &apos;s up , guys . &quot;
you &apos;re just gonna walk over and say , &quot; what &apos;s up , guys ? &quot;
winston , does he think you &apos;re omar epps ?
you guys talking about jax ?
look , i interviewed him at the radio station ,
and we just hit it off .
it &apos;s not a big deal , you know ,
unless you think hanging out
with a pro baller is a big deal .
his hands are so big and warm .
i want to fall asleep in them , like thumbelina .
how about , uh , introducing me ?
you and jax ?
yeah . jess and jax mctavish .
great bit , jess .
what a dumb idea .
do it .
no .
you can &apos;t handle that kind of thunder .
hell , no .
jax and i are just becoming friends .
i &apos;m going over there .
jess , no , jess .
guys ...
hey , jess , let me show you something .
hmm ?

you didn &apos;t go to the pro bowl .
here &apos;s my question :
what &apos;s a &quot; point @-@ eight &quot; tackle ?
did you know i &apos;m a teacher ?
what would you teach me ?
nick ... the theme is &quot; masculine garden party . &quot;
look at that-- i made a graph .
i thought you said i was gonna help you plan it .
nick , we both know that you &apos;re not very good
with party chores .
you sent out the invitations , right ?
me ? !
i sent them out ?
okay , i &apos;m older now . i am wiser .
i want to help plan my own party .
okay , fine , i will give you balloons ...
oh , sweet , balloons are ...
... and porta potties .
porta potties ? !
that sounds like a job for babies .
does that look like a job for babies ?
oh , so this is a big job ?
i thought you were being disrespectful .
no !
no .
where do you think people are gonna go to the bathroom ?
i never thought of that .
and you are now in charge of that ,
and if you dig a hole
in a , in , in a dirt field , i &apos;m gonna kill you .
i don &apos;t want the responsibility .
you can do this , man .
what , what are your chores ?
well , porta potties .
porta potties .
what &apos;s-- now , what is the first chore that i gave you ?
i have absolutely no memory .
balloons !
i &apos;m having an anxiety attack .
yes , ma , yes , now , look , i @-@ have to go .
it &apos;s two men celebrating living together for ten years .
uh , no , they &apos;re not .
no , i can tell you for a fact that they &apos;re not .
okay , okay , i &apos;m hanging up .
so , good news .
um , my mom spoke to your mom last night ,
and they &apos;ve given us their blessings .
so that means ...
well , now that the moms approve ,
when do you want to do this thing ?
is that a ... that a proposal ?
oh , are , are you upset ? i &apos;m sorry , i ...
it &apos;s just , with arranged marriage ,
there isn &apos;t a lot of romance .
no , no , no , i &apos;m s-- i &apos;m sorry , actually .
i think i &apos;m just a little taken aback
by how quick this all has been .
i barely know you , and ...
i used to just think that if i was being proposed to ,
i would notice it was happening .
but we &apos;re doing this thing ?
maybe you could just stop saying &quot; doing this thing . &quot;
yup .
really did it .
beautiful job , thank you so much , what a ...
this is amazing-- everything &apos;s tin , you guys , everything .
hey , man .
rented out the whole park , so take your soccer someplace else .
give us our ball back , you douche .
hey , yeah , sure , no ,
i &apos;ll give you your ball back . great .
pure tin , pure tin .
take your football back to europe .
really ?
who &apos;s the douche now , you douche &quot; b &quot; ?
i couldn &apos;t stop you from inviting jax to the party ,
but i can stop it from going any further .
i will not lose jax as a friend , okay ?
i might not have any game ,
but , oh , my goodness , can i take game away .
i &apos;m getting that mouth on my mouth ,
and don &apos;t you try to stop me , you ...
look , clearly i have the upper hand when it comes to jax .
do you ?
oh , i do , because i know all about sports .
jess , you know nothing about sports .
oh , what am i going to do ? i guess i &apos;ll just have to use
my eyes , hair , boobs , legs , and adorable personality .
fool .
i got , like , three of those things .
these are amazing .
you also got tablecloths ?
i feel so fancy .
how much did you spend on this , schmidt ?
ah , nicholas , i have what &apos;s called an income , you know .
well , you &apos;re not the only one
who spent a little bit of money on this .
okay . check this out , schmidt , you &apos;re gonna freak out .
hey , i &apos;m presenting , i &apos;m presenting it .
and that ain &apos;t no rental .
get up here .
this is owned and operated by mr. nick miller .
little help from sid .
you bought a porta potti ?
this one has warm and cold water ,
real soap dispensers , a fan .
too much .
what &apos;s that ?
that &apos;s garbage .
garbage-- that &apos;s what the nursing home said
about my mattress . i &apos;ll take it .
for 60 bucks , and they threw in something called
&quot; septic enzymes , &quot; which i don &apos;t know what that is ,
but you &apos;re not supposed to get it in your eyes , for sure .
i &apos;m a small business owner .
why on earth would you buy a ... ?
you know what ? forget about it , i &apos;m proud of you .
thank you , man .
i gave you a chore and you came through .
yeah , now , look , now we have two .
what do you mean we have two-- two of what ?
two bathrooms .
yours and our presidente .
that &apos;s a porta potti ?
yeah , luxury toilet .
i thought that was the visitor &apos;s center .
well ... that &apos;s enormous .
why did you get that , schmidt ?
what , did you think i was gonna screw up ?
no , come on , man , no .
you know how our relationship works .
i &apos;m over @-@ responsible , you &apos;re under @-@ responsible .
here &apos;s the good news-- now people have a backup to use ...
no , i want everyone to use this , i want it to be the main potty .
oh , n @-@ no , i don &apos;t think that should be the main anything .
i think people would be better off
if they just made a caca in their hand .
i don &apos;t think so , mine &apos;s better than that .
i &apos;m sure you killed it on balloons .
well ... if you let me explain
what happened with the balloons ...
who needs balloons ?
i didn &apos;t want balloons anyway .
this isn &apos;t a little girl &apos;s birthday party .
this is a celebration of friendship .
then , as a friend ...
yeah .
i want you to get rid of that .
i want everybody using mine .
you spit on the shirt .
oh , we will see .

yeah .
i &apos;m a small business owner ...

a porta potti ?
yeah , but nobody &apos;s using it .
this is not about a porta potti .
it is about a porta potti .
i don &apos;t want to talk about this .
you know , it &apos;s been really nice hanging out with jax .
because he likes to talk about his feelings .
give me a break , jess . is that really what you want--
a man who talks about his feelings all the time ?
no , right ?
do you want me to use your porta potti ?
yeah , but don &apos;t just do it for me ; do it &apos; cause you want to .
mm , i &apos;m definitely doing it for you .
and just a tip ...
yeah ?
if you want people to use your toilet ,
don &apos;t camp out in front of it .
do me a favor , if you &apos;re going to go in .
really sell it , &apos; cause i want girls to see it .
okay .
you know what i mean ? just , like , make a show of it .
okay .
thank you .

also , our girl @-@ to @-@ guy ratio is taking a real nosedive .
i mean , we &apos;re , like , two bro groups away
from being a total wiener fest .
it &apos;s just really disappointing when things don &apos;t work out
the way you thought they would , you know ?
i do .
hey , why don &apos;t we get out of here for a bit ?
get away from this party stress .
you mean , like , take a trip together .

don &apos;t think we need a trip or anything like that , pal .
jess ?
hey ! hey ! oh , my god !
so excited for you . let me see it . yeah .

i was dealing with the porta potti .
it &apos;s actually kind of nice .
it &apos;s peaceful .

because we were all gonna share ...
i don &apos;t know where i &apos;m going ,
but i &apos;m going !
where are you going ? !
we &apos;re pretty awesome wingmen for each other .
