that the kingdom of moab
is the least interesting in the bible .

allow me to introduce our guest speaker
from the ill @-@ advised mission in indonesia ,
the reverend kartawijaya .
i know how you feel , young man . huh ?
the children in my village are just like you .
one boy , named sumadi , never comes to church .
he is always tying the monkeys &apos; tails together
and yelling , &quot; tiger is gone , &quot;
when , in fact , tiger is there .
unfortunately , sumadi is sick now .

sumadi and others equally doe @-@ eyed ...

son , by rights , i should be playing banjo at your funeral .
that frog was filled to the gills with formaldehyde ,
a highly toxic poison .

and , homer , here &apos;s your bill for $ 4,000 .
d &apos;oh !
where &apos;s my money ? you got my money ?
where &apos;s my money ?
seriously , where &apos;s my money ?
ew ! it &apos;s the kid who ate the dead frog !
herbivore !
that &apos;s someone who eats plants .
i named the frog herb .
even you won &apos;t sit with me ?
bart , if you sit here , i &apos;ll be the boy
who sat next to the boy who ate the frog .
and i &apos;m already the boy who shared a comb with a boy
who threw up on the boy
who wet his pants at the winter carnival .
p.s. i would &apos;ve given you the money .
what &apos;s the matter , frog in your throat ?
you &apos;re the ones that paid me to eat it .
all we hear is : ribbit , ribbit !
you said this was a simple bullying job !
diggs and freedom at your service .
diggs is short for digby .
thanks . i &apos;m the kid that ate the frog .
oh , so you &apos;re the reason
i had to dissect a muppet in biology today .
thanks for the help , man .
oh , you &apos;re welcome .
at least for me .
there &apos;s no way to say what the bird thinks .
or even if he thinks , really .
wait , wait , wait !
who the hell are you ?
i transferred here a few months ago .
to this school ? on purpose ?
even after springfield montessori opened
across the street ?
that place is really in your face .
i like the lack of attention .
especially in here .
this school has a falconry club ?
no way .
i resuscitated it .
i &apos;m president , secretary treasurer
and faculty advisor .
that took a lot of fancy paperwork .
but it was worth it to be left alone .
can i join ?
hmm . i &apos;ll have to check with freedom .
habemus papam !
we have a poop !
it &apos;s white . you &apos;re in .
looks like the falconry club &apos;s back from the dead .
can the esperanto society be far behind ?
i mean ...
cu la esperanto @-@ societo esti multe malantau ?
two languages ,
and somehow no one will talk to you .
gi estas vera .
mi tre soleca .
loser .
the first thing to learn about falcons
is how beautiful they are in flight .
don &apos;t fret . he &apos;ll be back .
there &apos;s my sky gramma !
bart &apos;s usually first in line for taco night ,
but now he &apos;s muy tarde .
oh , is it all right to say &quot; tarde &quot; ?
mmm , hey , you &apos;ve said it twice , marge--
you &apos;re in pretty deep .
homer !
ten @-@ minute rule !
lisa !
what ? a rule &apos;s a rule .
there he is !
ah , he is just riding that thermal !
you were right about watching him fly .
i thought you &apos;d get it .
seat backs and tray tables , bart.
we &apos;re coming in for a landing .
wow , you don &apos;t know how impressive that is
to a boy whose dad can &apos;t even get the dog to sit .
sit . sit .
sit ...
sit !
sit !
i don &apos;t know what that is ,
but it &apos;s not sitting !
where could bart be ?
i saw him heading across the field after school
with a kid a little bit older and undoubtedly wiser .
oh , i know what that means !
there comes a time when a boy sneaks his first beer .
finally ! i was beginning to think that kid was a ...
teetotaler .
bart simpson , at your service .
more like &quot; at your six @-@ pack , &quot; am i right ?
it &apos;s okay if you need to take a little nap .
why would i want a nap ?
because you &apos;re so drunk you can barely keep it together .
i wasn &apos;t drinking .
i was learning that nature isn &apos;t a complete waste of space .
that doesn &apos;t sound like you .
but it does sound like the kind of lie
you &apos;d make up after the first time you got blitzed .
i met this kid .
a little older , kind of strange .
i don &apos;t think other people get him .
but i just want to hang out with him all the time .
it &apos;s even better than i thought .
you &apos;ve found your moe szyslak !
in just a few short years ,
you &apos;ll be getting your version of baked
on your version of pot
listening to your version of journey .
what &apos;s he doing ?
now , when he lands , you &apos;ll feed him
so he has positive associations with you .
don &apos;t worry , he &apos;s only bitten off one of my fingers .
just goofing on you .
this is the finger he bit off .
if he starts to carry you off , slip out of the glove .
now tell him to fly .
fly ! fly !
come on , man ! do the wing thing !
i did it ! he did it !
we did it !
yes , bart , that is how you conjugate the verb &quot; to do . &quot;
well done .
* come saturday morning *
* i &apos;m going away with my friend *
* we &apos;ll saturday spend *
* till the end of the day *
* just i and my friend *
bring back my bling .
* we &apos;ll travel for miles *
* in our saturday smiles *
give that back !
all i got is a hole in my face !
uncle krusty &apos;s back .
did you teach him to do that ?
nobody could communicate that .
except maybe gerard manley hopkins .
下诗为他的著作 《 飞鹰 》 ( the windhover )
&quot; i caught this morning morning &apos;s minion
kingdom of daylight &apos;s dauphin ,
&quot; dapple @-@ dawn @-@ drawn falcon , in his riding
我可不是你妈
&quot; of the rolling level underneath him steady air , and striding
high there , how he rung upon the rein of a wimpling wing . &quot;
i &apos;ve already eaten .
hey , you want to see something really cool ?
is a falcon &apos;s training leash called a creance ?
yes !
say something so i &apos;ll know you &apos;re not hurt .
i &apos;m really hurt .
phew !
bartholomew !
good to see you , old sport .
where &apos;s freedom ?
well , my dad said don &apos;t bring home any more dogs , cats ,
turtles or snakes , but he never
said anything about predatory birds .
okay , in your terms , points are like mice ...
don &apos;t interrupt . i just thought
it would be nice if we shared an interest .
you korean girls know what a soldier likes .
fine ! but the game is much more enjoyable
if you understand it .
look , the eagles and the falcons .
tell me you &apos;re not interested in that .
i could fly , too , if i didn &apos;t have
a wife and three kids !
hey , you &apos;ve had a lot of visitors .
no , i signed them myself .
they &apos;re people i would &apos;ve liked to come visit .
ay , caramba !
listen , what happened in that tree ?
um , you want the truth ?
of course you do .
you &apos;re like diogenes .
but with slingshot in place of lamp .
i wanted to fly .
i know it sounds a little crazy now ,
but i suddenly thought maybe we can all fly ,
but somehow we &apos;ve forgotten that we can .
you don &apos;t still think that , do you ?
hey , i &apos;m not flying anywhere with this broken wing .
bart , here &apos;s another doctor that would like
a few words with this young man .
this hospital has another doctor ?
so they &apos;re transferring him to another hospital .
well , i hope he gets out soon and takes his bird back .
i don &apos;t care for how it circles the cat .
he &apos;s just riding the thermals from dad &apos;s butt .
at least someone in this family is using them .
i never heard of this new hospital ,
so i looked it up and printed it out .
can i visit him tomorrow ?
i don &apos;t know , bart.
this is one of those
arkham asylum @-@ type hospitals .
diggs isn &apos;t cuckoo !
uh , listen , boy .
maybe you should spend more time
with your old best friend .
you know , dweebler .
milhouse abandoned me .
so , why can &apos;t i go there ?
bart , if this is what i think it is ,
it &apos;s not a place we should ever , ever take a little boy .
then why is diggs there ?
because it &apos;s his home forever .
you know , bart ,
just because diggs is a little different
doesn &apos;t mean he &apos;s not a good person .
what would you know about friends like diggs ?
i have about eight of them .
so , how do we fix him ?
oh , bart.
diggs &apos;s problems don &apos;t have easy fixes .
what kind of cheer @-@ up talk is this ?
well , sometimes it helps to know people feel for you .
want a hug ?
you hug the bedpost .
then i hug the bedpost .
that way we never hug each other .
* come saturday morning *
* i &apos;m going away ... *
hey , simpson .
i heard bird boy got a new cage .
one with rubber bars .
yeah , and a rubber perch !
yeah , yeah , and a ...
i get it . it sucks .
really sucks .
rubber birdfeeder .
making fun of the mentally ill--
real classy .
but you guys were ...
we were what , captain sensitive ?
the rumors of my bonkertude have been greatly exaggerated .
dsm @-@ 5 indicates paranoid schizophrenia ,
but that work is mired in controversy .
mired .
i knew you &apos;d escape !
were you carried out by a flock of falcons ?
i got a one @-@ day pass .
were falcons involved in any way ?
i obtained the pass to enter the springfield falconry contest ,
which is what freedom and i were training for
when we first met you .
oh , great .
before anything else , let me just get closer
to the door and say , &quot; how crazy are you ? &quot;
i &apos;m fine . my meds won &apos;t wear off till tonight .
then i &apos;ll have freedom tear you to shreds .
no offense , but when a crazy guy
pretends to be crazy , it &apos;s not funny .
you &apos;re discounting all talk radio .
春田峡谷乡村俱乐部
excellent .
fly , my pet , fly !
yes !
yes , now back to papa .
yes .
why am i not surprised the only sport you do
is one where a bird brings you food ?
um , a falcon &apos;s greatest joy
is to serve its master .
fatso !
once again , i must point out
that you are not a parrot .
fatso , fatso ! pees in the shower !
shut up .
what are you doing ?
we &apos;re up next .
when freedom hits the air ,
you and i open all the cages .
with our minds ?
no .
with this rope .
i &apos;m a messed @-@ up kid .
i &apos;m not magneto .
diggs and freedom .
&quot; in his ecstasy .
then off , off forth on swing ! &quot;
where &apos;s my bird going ?
wherever he wants .
he &apos;s free now .
if you see the stork what brings us babies ,
kill it !
now , bart , i &apos;m afraid one @-@ day passes don &apos;t last forever .
and i &apos;m probably not going to get another one
for quite a while .
wait !
wh @-@ when will i see you ?
you can &apos;t quit the falconry club !
it &apos;s all yours , mr. president .
well , i guess some delicate birds
are safer in a cage .
i had thought of it as a therapeutic milieu ,
but now &quot; cage &quot; is stuck in my head , so thanks .
and thanks for being my friend .
bart , when i pushed you away ,
i was really pushing away the thought of losing you .
how long did it take you to think that up ?
two hours with the therapist .
i &apos;ll take that .
she came in on a saturday .
missed her kid &apos;s karate demonstration .
he was going up a belt .
enough !
mom , you didn &apos;t cook the falcon ?
of course not . it &apos;s just duck .
pass the peas , please .
