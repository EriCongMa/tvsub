the other side is collapsing ,
and everyone in it is going away .
we need to start the spell again .
we can &apos;t . that was our one shot .
but damon &apos;s on the other side .
the spell the travelers cast across mystic falls
eliminates spirit magic ,
vampires can &apos;t get into mystic falls .
they can lurk around the borders .
luke parker has been feeding her some concoction
that allows her to hallucinate damon .
the herbs , they make me so thirsty .
please help me .
stefan didn &apos;t say good @-@ bye .
damon and bonnie died and he just left .
i need you to tell me
that you &apos;re gonna find damon and bring him back .
because i don &apos;t think i can live forever without him .
i can &apos;t . i gave up .
i moved on .
i want you to take away damon .
i want you to compel me to forget that
i ever loved him .
do you think it will hurt ?
i don &apos;t know .
that got awkward fast .
what happened ?
where is everybody ?
where you going ?
well , i feel a fang , so i &apos;m still a vampire .
either i &apos;m a dead vampire , or mystic falls is no longer magic @-@ free .
look .
i definitely blew that up about an hour ago .
why don &apos;t we see any people ?
if we &apos;re still on the other side ,
we should at least be able to see the living .
where the hell are we ?
and i don &apos;t mean geographically .
i have no idea .
jer , come on . we &apos;re gonna be--
matt ! sorry . i--i needed a place to crash .
jer said it was cool .
this isn &apos;t jer &apos;s house .
well , it &apos;s not yours either .
look . it &apos;s no big deal .
i can just take off .
yeah . why don &apos;t you do that ?
why would you bring her here ?
you shouldn &apos;t be anywhere near her , dumbass ,
not after what happened yesterday .
caroline compelled her to forget elena attacked her .
it &apos;s not a big deal .
not a big deal ?
right . i forgot . you don &apos;t care about anything .
what are you doing ?
i mean , i thought it &apos;d be nice to--
completely overstay my welcome .
i &apos;m sorry . i thought , uh--
never mind what i thought .
no . i just wasn &apos;t really expecting you to still be here , so ...
right . so why should you expect somebody
you spent the night with to make assumptions about breakfast ?
i &apos;m gonna go .
no , no , no , ivy--
stefan , i get it .
i am super into you , you &apos;re ...
intermittently into me .
breakfast bad .
don &apos;t worry about it .
ivy .
look . why don &apos;t we have dinner tonight ,
although ...
i should probably do the cooking .
it &apos;s been 4 months .
it &apos;s time for me to let go .
you gonna erase bonnie from your head , too .
missing bonnie makes me sad , jer .
missing damon makes me dangerous .
alaric will compel away any memories
and then make me forget that i had him do it .
i need you to keep the truth from me , too .
tyler and stefan are on board .
what about caroline ?
somehow , i doubt she &apos;ll take much convincing .
you said that stefan was looking for a way
to bring bonnie and damon back .
i thought he was .
i &apos;ve been feeding him leads for months .
he let me believe he was following them .
well , i &apos;ve been a little focused on magic bubble duty ,
and as you can see by the lack of magic in mystic falls ,
it &apos;s a spectacular fail of a mission ,
and now you &apos;re telling me that this whole time
no one has been doing anything to help
bonnie and damon ?
i wouldn &apos;t exactly say no one .
come on . just a little hint .
i don &apos;t know anything .
oh , you witches are all so monstrously secretive .
lucky for me , i &apos;m quite gifted at unraveling the truth .
ok . there &apos;s a coven in oregon ,
they found away to communicate
with their ancestors on the other side
before it went away .
maybe they know what happened to your friends .
they call themselves the gemini coven .
they &apos;re small and weird ,
and they don &apos;t like outsiders .
see ? you did know something .
i just wanted you to work for it .
now there &apos;s a blast from the past .
hello , gorgeous .
talk me through it again .
i raided the psychology department &apos;s research library .
in a nutshell , we &apos;ll be using a combination
of hypnotherapy and memory reprocessing techniques .
the more we talk ,
the more you &apos;ll relax
and open your mind to me .
we &apos;re gonna be searching through memories that are deeply embedded ,
and each significant memory that we hit
which is connected to damon i will help you modify ,
and this should eventually lead us
to the signature memory , which once erased
will create a positive domino effect
through all your other memories .
can &apos;t you just compel me to forget everything at once ,
and we can go get a beer ?
i &apos;m supernaturally rewiring 3 years of your memories .
if it were that easy , i wouldn &apos;t be so terrified .
i have some questions .
answer them honestly .
i will answer everything honestly .
do you have doubts about this ?
yes , but i know i have to do this .
are you afraid ?
more sad than afraid .
why sad ?
because i don &apos;t want to stop loving him .
do you trust me to be digging around in your mind ?
i trust you completely .
ok .
well , then let &apos;s ...
let &apos;s get started .
who was damon salvatore ?
he was my boyfriend .
i loved him , and he died .
and when did you first meet him ?
i was in high school .
katherine .
no . i &apos;m elena .
i &apos;m damon .
and what was he like ?
there was something different about him ,
dangerous but not in a way that scared me .
he was exciting .
i don &apos;t know what i want .
that &apos;s not true .
you want what everybody wants .
what ?
and how did he make you feel ?
like anything was possible .
you had a nice moment on the road with a stranger ,
but that &apos;s all he was , a stranger .
a stranger .
two people passing in the night .
are you ok ?
yeah . let &apos;s just-- let &apos;s just keep going .
how many more streets are we gonna wander ?
how many times are you gonna ask me questions
i don &apos;t have the answers to ?
there &apos;s something weird about these cars .
yeah , they &apos;re almost all 20 years old or more ,
and yet they look brand @-@ new .
and that is elena &apos;s not @-@ so @-@ burnt @-@ to @-@ a @-@ crisp house .
look .
&quot; rare solar eclipse expected to be seen across 12 states . &quot;
the date .
may 10 ... 1994 .
is that--are we-- that &apos;s impossible .
i don &apos;t think we should be asking where we are .
i think we should be asking when we are .
tell me about this moment .
no . you know what ?
if i &apos;m gonna feel guilty about something ,
i &apos;m gonna feel guilty about this .
he kissed me .
i mean , i shouldn &apos;t have let him .
i knew that he was in love with me ,
and even thought stefan and i were on the outs ,
i shouldn &apos;t have let him .
he kissed you . you thought it was inappropriate .
you told him so .
i told him it was wrong .
who &apos;s damon salvatore ?
he was my boyfriend .
i loved him , and ...
he ...
he died .
why don &apos;t we , uh--
why don &apos;t we take a little break , ok ?
to be honest , i could use a drink .
wonder if there &apos;s any booze in this empty retroville .
feels so weird to be back here .
practically grew up on this porch .
all right . talk me through it .
before the other side collapsed ,
my grams said that she made a sacrifice so i could find peace .
the part where you actually have a theory .
well , this clearly isn &apos;t peace .
otherwise , i wouldn &apos;t be stuck here with you .
rude .
she must have-- i don &apos;t know--
sent me somewhere , and when i held your hand ,
took you with me .
well , did she happen to whisper a safe word
in her last breaths , a clue maybe ,
witchy path out of here ?
no , but if we got here by magic ,
magic should be able to get us out .
and that frown that &apos;s not upside down is telling me what ?
phesmatos , incendia .
still can &apos;t do magic .
perfect .
you &apos;re the last person i think would object
to me erasing positive memories of damon from my head .
yeah , but we we are literally chasing a lead .
what if we find something out ?
what if damon returns home
and everything returns back to normal
and then you &apos;re just sitting there
all confused and weird ?
then alaric will bring back my memories .
but ...
but what ?
go ahead , caroline . say what you need to say .
i don &apos;t want to pressure you into agreeing .
i don &apos;t know what to say .
i was actually just trying to think of what bonnie would say .
and ?
and she &apos;d say that you should do what &apos;s best for you .
look . i think it &apos;s great that you still have hope , i really do ,
but for fo own survival , i need to let him go .
well , then go on with your
&quot; what would bonnie bennett do ? &quot; plan .
i &apos;ll make bumper stickers .
i love you .
i love you , too .
girl bonding . very sweet .
i heard you dropped out of school .
and i heard that you were a lurker who was spying on my life .
when do we exit ?
soon . you should reconsider .
looks can only get a girl so far these days .
heh . yeah , well , i &apos;m not taking feminist tips
from the guy who just used his tongue
to get secrets out of a coat check girl .
garment attendant .
you just made that up .
so did you also make up the gemini coven lead , too ?
because i &apos;ve never heard of them .
who are they ?
no idea . that &apos;s not where we &apos;re headed .
what ? !
wait . where are we going ?
you &apos;ll see .
perfect timing . i was just--
i ran into some of your friends .
what ? where ?
here .
stefan ! you are a hard man to track down .
i wasn &apos;t sure if your new friend
would invite us in , but she said this was your place ,
which means open invitation for all your mates , right ?
got any bourbon ?
good stuff , mate .
so how do you guys know stefan ?
he and i went to high school together .
he used to date my best friend .
not that he &apos;s not allowed to date .
i mean , they broke up .
i just didn &apos;t realize that he had met someone .
so how did you meet exactly ?
uh , ivy &apos;s car was in the shop where i work .
you work in an auto repair shop ?
it &apos;s relaxing .
why ? what did you used to do ?
oh , man of all seasons , jack of all trades .
oh , you have a lovely clavicle .
oh ! thank you . i think .
forgive me . i always notice a woman &apos;s neck .
i &apos;m a neck person !
so &apos;s stefan . right , stefan ?
not anymore .
well , that &apos;s silly .
you can &apos;t just stop being a neck person .
is enzo your boyfriend ?
oh ! oh , god no .
would you date that ?
uh , hello . i &apos;m right here .
i have supersensitive hearing ,
practically supernatural .
do you believe in the supernatural , ivy ?
uh , never really thought about it .
myself , i &apos;m a believer .
had to get a witch to do a locator spell to find my buddy here .
i didn &apos;t know you cooked .
i don &apos;t . how &apos;d you sleep ?
me--not good . my 1994 mattress was very lumpy .
what you go there ?
miss cuddles .
i lost her when i was 9 , but i went into my house last night ,
and there she was .
i also found this at my grams &apos; house ,
her old grimoire .
yeah ? well , i found this .
drank it last year when ric died .
so we &apos;re in this snapshot of another time or something .
everything that existed in 1994
still exists .
for better or for worse .
listen . there was a time when i couldn &apos;t practice magic .
this grimoire taught me a lot .
maybe i can reteach myself .
if you &apos;re still a witch ,
which with our luck and your skill probably ain &apos;t the case .
would a little support kill you ?
i am acutely aware that we are in some otherworldly time dimension .
however , did you ever think for one second
that maybe it &apos;s you being negative
reacting to my natural self negatively , hmm ?
you &apos;re ridiculous .
nope . i &apos;m consistent .
eat your pancakes .
oh , and ...
you can do a crossword puzzle .
oh , gee , thanks .
breakfast with my least favorite person
and a crossword puzzle from 1994 .
all right .
what &apos;s a 7 @-@ letter word for ...
you &apos;ve got to be kidding me .
bonnie , look at the date on that paper .
it says may 10 , 1994 .
it &apos;s the same day as yesterday .
we &apos;re living the same day
all over again .
well , that proves it .
we &apos;re in hell ,
my own personal , custom @-@ built hell ,
and you &apos;re in it with me .
bottoms up .
a little early for that , don &apos;t you think ?
it &apos;s dark out .
i meant in life .
where &apos;s sarah ?
don &apos;t know . not her keeper .
i &apos;m going for a jog .
you guys don &apos;t like each other very much , do you ?
he &apos;s trying to give me purpose .
why didn &apos;t you tell him i &apos;m still here ?
didn &apos;t feel like it .
5 miles with the group this morning wasn &apos;t enough for you ?
tripp , hey .
i was just blowing off some steam . what &apos;s up ?
that girl from yesterday ,
the one with the animal bite .
do you know where she ended up ?
yeah , my house .
i &apos;m not sure how that happened .
she there now ?
no . she split . why ?
i have some deputy buddies over at the station .
one of them said that the sheriff ran her plates
and the car came up stolen .
you &apos;re kidding .
no .
now i can be paranoid , but there &apos;s a bad element coming through town ,
i want to keep tabs on it .
yeah .
so let me know if she shows up back up at your place .
yeah , i will .
it was the miss mystic falls pageant .
stefan was supposed to be my escort ,
but he bailed on me .
damon stepped in .
he saved me from being embarrassed
in front of everyone .
he took my arm and led me out
with the rest of the girls and all their dates ,
and we danced .
i remember that was the first time
that i felt it .
felt what ?
how sexy he was .
i &apos;d never ...
let myself notice until then .
i mean , obviously , i knew that he was attractive ,
but i didn &apos;t want to see him that way .
you went down the stairs ,
and no one was there .
i was embarrassed , but i got over it .
who is damon salvatore ?
he was my boyfriend . i loved him ,
and he died .
ric , i hate this .
i mean , how much longer is it gonna take ?
until we find that signature moment ,
the moment you knew you loved him .
well , that &apos;s easy .
it was after i found out about the sire bond .
everyone kept telling me that my feelings weren &apos;t real ,
but i knew that they were .
ok . your feelings were because of the sire bond .
who is damon salvatore ?
he was my boyfriend .
that &apos;s not it . you got to dig deeper , earlier .
i @-@ i don &apos;t know , ok ? i ...
maybe it was when we spent the night at the motel together .
i wasn &apos;t back together with stefan yet ,
and i remember when i was laying in bed with him
all i could think about was kissing him .
i wanted to kiss him so badly .
no one kissed anyone . who &apos;s damon salvatore ?
he was my boyfriend .
that &apos;s not it . next .
i don &apos;t know , ric !
well , think about it , elena .
think about that moment when you knew
this person was somebody that you had feelings for ,
that you loved ,
and that you could see those feelings going on forever .
trust me . you never forget it .
maybe we should just forget about this entire thing .
it was a stupid idea , ok ?
i can &apos;t do this anymore , all right ?
i &apos;m done . i &apos;m sorry .
what &apos;s a 7 @-@ letter word for &quot; kill me now &quot; ?
that joke got old 6 weeks ago .
so did this crossword puzzle .
every day for two months ,
i &apos;ve done this stupid thing ,
and i still can &apos;t figure out 27 across .
&quot; an old tongue twister eddie turned top 40 &quot; ?
and i hate pancakes !
whoa . don &apos;t take it out on the pancakes .
those pancakes , like myself ,
are waiting for you to be witchy to get us the hell out of here .
you know i &apos;ve been trying .
and failing .
further evidence we &apos;re in hell .
not only am i stuck with you ,
i &apos;m stuck with the useless version of you .
did you hear that ?
what would i have heard , bonnie ?
we &apos;re the only two people here .
we were the only two people here two months ago ,
and we &apos;re the only two people here now !
well , i swear i heard something .
maybe it &apos;s the sound of existential despair .
i hear that &apos;s what hell sounds like .
you know what ? you think we &apos;re trapped in your hell ?
i have to spend every day on repeat
with the person i like least on this earth .
maybe we &apos;re trapped in mine .
so , stefan , tell us .
this house , very charming .
when &apos;d you get it ?
about a month or so ago .
no . more than that , remember ?
we met two months ago , and you already had it .
you &apos;ve lived here for more than two months ?
yeah . yeah . i guess i have .
well , i guess that &apos;s just weird
because everyone thought you were living somewhere else ,
and your job was supposed to be investigative work ,
not auto repair .
right . well , i &apos;ve moved on from that job .
well , you can &apos;t move on from investigative work
until you &apos;ve solved the investigation , stefan .
how about we just drop it ?
i &apos;m happy doing what i &apos;m doing now ,
and that &apos;s all that should really matter , right ?
there , darling , no need to make a scene .
really it &apos;s all probably just some big misunderstanding .
perhaps this will clear it all up .
aah ! oh , my god !
enzo !
what the hell is wrong with you ?
so many secrets .
what are you running from , stefan ?
oh . i @-@ i don &apos;t .
calm down , come with me . let &apos;s go upstairs .
no need to make a scene ?
what kind of coward gives up on his own brother ?
you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
why don &apos;t you enlighten me ?
hey . this is really not a good time .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;ve just hit a wall with elena .
i just need some insight .
ok . what &apos;s the wall ?
i &apos;m trying to get her to figure out
when she first fell in love with damon ,
but she can &apos;t seem to get there .
well , yeah , because she doesn &apos;t want to admit
what everyone else already knows .
she fell in love with damon when she was still with stefan .
should probably get him out of here .
he &apos;ll be up soon , and i really don &apos;t feel like another go @-@ around .
i &apos;m sorry that you heard what i said .
it &apos;s fine , caroline .
i really don &apos;t care .
why ?
why don &apos;t you care ?
you were the one who always cared .
it &apos;s what i liked about you .
you know , amidst all the crazy in our perfectly messed up lives ,
you cared more than anyone ,
so how could you just stop ?
because i had to .
i had to move on .
you know , the months before i moved here ,
i was following every lead that alaric sent my way .
i spoke to every witch , every shaman ,
every psychic in 20 countries around the globe ,
and every lead was a dead end .
but enzo has another lead .
there &apos;s this coven in oregon --
the gemini coven . yeah .
i looked into them , too , caroline .
there was nothing there . because there &apos;s nothing we can do .
damon and bonnie are dead .
i had to come to terms with that ,
and once i did , i had to start over .
i couldn &apos;t just live my old life with my old friends .
i couldn &apos;t go near mystic falls or elena --
or me ?
because i thought we were closer than that .
i mean , you couldn &apos;t hear in all those messages that i left you ,
you couldn &apos;t hear that i was completely falling apart without you ?
because you never listened to them .
i had to move on . i didn &apos;t have a choice .
i had to erase everything .
well , let me summarize them for you .
you &apos;re a dick .
and if you want him out of your house ,
you throw him out yourself .
... is not available . leave a message .
luke , where are you ?
i need more of that stuff , like , now .
i &apos;m starting to go ...
i don &apos;t want to hear it , ric , ok ?
we tried . it didn &apos;t work .
it &apos;s over .
it didn &apos;t work because you weren &apos;t being honest .
i wasn &apos;t--
are you crazy ?
i was being completely honest .
do you think i want to talk to you about my romantic life ?
you weren &apos;t being honest with yourself .
look . i want to hear all the damon stuff
while you were still with stefan .
no . i was completely faithful to stefan .
of course you were .
i did everything .
i know .
i stuck with him ,
even when he lost his humanity ...
i know you did .
after he left a trail of bodies
from florida to virginia .
i fought for him .
i know you did , elena .
you don &apos;t want to admit it
because you feel like you &apos;re betraying stefan ,
but this won &apos;t work until you do .
no . i loved stefan the entire time .
i never would have hurt him .
elena , you have been lucky enough to love
two people this deeply in your young life .
there &apos;s nothing wrong with that .
it &apos;s ok .
it &apos;s ok to love them both .
that &apos;s what katherine used to say .
how sad is it that my own evil doppelganger
was smarter than me ?
it &apos;s ok , elena . you can tell me .
tell me the moment you knew you loved him .
it was my birthday .
damon and i spent the entire summer looking for stefan ,
and i was trying to put on a good face
because caroline was throwing this party for me ,
but i was so sad .
i was two seconds from deciding that i wasn &apos;t gonna go .
i wasn &apos;t gonna leave the room
until damon walked in
to give me my birthday gift .
it was a necklace that stefan had given me .
i &apos;d lost it , and damon knew
what the necklace meant to me .
my necklace .
what it meant about my feelings for stefan .
even though he loved me ,
he gave me the one thing that represented hope
for me and his brother .
i knew how much it hurt him ,
but he did it .
it was ...
the most selfless that he &apos;s ever been ,
and in that moment , i loved him .
i didn &apos;t want to .
it terrified me , but ...
for that moment , i loved him .
do it .
it &apos;s ok . i &apos;m ready .
i need you to be sure .
are you sure ?
i &apos;m sure .
just take it away , please .
damon never came into the room .
he never gave you the necklace .
the party was miserable ,
and you spent the rest of the night at the house watching movies
and eating popcorn with jeremy .
damon , no !
jeremy .
damon ...
killed jeremy .
he snapped his neck right in front of me .
elena ...
who is damon salvatore ?
he &apos;s stefan &apos;s brother .
he was a monster ,
and then he died .
hey , you .
put on some party clothes and come to whitmore .
tyler &apos;s coming over , and we are going out .
you sound good .
i am good . i had a good day .
i ditched all my classes and hung out with ric .
we , um , we talked about bonnie .
i had a good cry , and i don &apos;t know .
i really feel like things are taking a turn for the better .
so get your ass down here ,
and let &apos;s have some fun .
well , how about i come and sneak into the dorms
and spend the night later
for old time &apos;s sake ?
sounds perfect . love you .
love you , too .
well , well .
that was a bit of a bust .
i &apos;ll be right back .
hey . did your friends leave ?
whoa . what happened ?
oh , you know , my friend , he &apos;s , uh ,
a bad drunk .
well , at least your friend caroline seemed nice .
yeah .
i &apos;m gonna throw this out .
let her go .
ok .
i &apos;ve got a girl out there crying over you
because she cares so much ,
and i &apos;m here trying to figure out why
but i can &apos;t see what &apos;s worth caring about .
you know , damon once told me that he promised you
an eternity of misery , and i remember thinking ,
&quot; well , what could his brother have ever done
to inspire so much hatred ? &quot;
but now i get it .
you &apos;re not a brother to him .
brothers don &apos;t give up .
so every time i see you doing anything
that looks like you &apos;ve done so ,
every time you try to start over in a life
that &apos;s nothing but a lie ,
i will make you pay .
i will be the one to bring you the misery you deserve .
see ? we &apos;re still neck people .
it &apos;s bonnie .
leave me a message .
hey . it &apos;s me . i paid your cell bill again .
your mom said i could .
i think she felt sorry for me or something .
maybe she just wants to hear the sound of your voice , too .
what do i know ?
i am so pissed at you , bonnie .
yeah . still . you told me you were gonna die over the phone ,
so you kind of deserve me railing at you on voicemails
that you &apos;re never gonna get .
i guess i &apos;ll call and yell at you again tomorrow .
gah ! you scared the hell out of me .
we got a little problem .
sarah &apos;s shady . the plates on her car are stolen .
she &apos;s got to go .
what are you-- deputy dewey ?
how do you know that ?
it doesn &apos;t matter how he knows it .
he &apos;s right . i stole it from my old boss .
he had wandering hands ,
so i wandered my hands to his car keys .
look , no offense , but you got to find someplace else to stay .
i totally get it .
i appreciate you guys helping me .
really , i do .
it &apos;s ok . i have family here sort of .
i mean , i haven &apos;t met him ,
but my dad , he supposedly lives here .
it &apos;s not like he &apos;s gonna let me sleep on the street , right ?
matt , at least let her stay till she finds her dad .
seriously , jer ?
i &apos;m on the community protection committee ,
and she &apos;s a car thief .
all right . fine .
we can go stay at stefan and damon &apos;s . no one &apos;s there .
you can &apos;t leave . i told elena that i &apos;d watch out for you .
it &apos;s not like she can do anything about it .
so she says she has family here .
that &apos;s probably another lie ,
but i &apos;ll look into it .
thanks , matt .
look . jeremy &apos;s a good kid .
he &apos;s just going through some stuff .
i know all about him .
i grew up with his dad .
wait . you &apos;re from mystic falls ?
born and raised till my parents split .
i think that &apos;s why i &apos;m such a geek about this town .
my family were such big supporters ,
one of the founding families actually .
which family ?
the fells .
i &apos;m thomas vincent fell iii , to be exact .
my dad called me tripp ,
but i was such a clumsy kid
that i took my mom &apos;s maiden name when he bailed .
can you imagine-- tripp fell ?
so if you &apos;re from a founding family ,
that means you know all the stuff that goes along with it then , right ?
is there a secret handshake i never got taught ?
look . um , i got to go .
i &apos;ll see you later for training , though , yeah ?
yeah , sure .
any final words ?
i miss them , too , you know ?
look who got 27 across .
i wish . 27 across is a rock
i am pushing up an endless mountain .
&quot; an old tongue twister eddie turned top 40 . &quot;
eddie vedder , pearl jam .
&quot; yellow ledbetter . &quot;
good work .
are you messing with me ?
no . are you messing with me ?
i didn &apos;t finish this .
well , neither did i.
there &apos;s someone else here .
