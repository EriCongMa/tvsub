it &apos;s , like , the best one they make ,
i just can &apos;t get it to work .
i &apos;ll figure it out .
it streams hd video straight to your phone while it &apos;s flying .
nice .
where were you when i was single ?
okay , we should leave in about an hour . you all packed ?
uh , yeah , i just need to throw in a few last minute things--
you know , makeup , underwear , clothes .
if your bathroom floor counts as a carry @-@ on ,
you &apos;re packed .
leonard , have you ever given a high school commencement speech before ?
nope . it &apos;s pretty exciting .
aren &apos;t you afraid of being blinded ?
how would i be blinded ?
at the end of the ceremony ,
all the students throw those pointy hats in the air .
it &apos;s all pomp and circumstance until someone loses an eye .
i &apos;ll take my chances .
fine .
i wonder if they make &quot; i told you so &quot; cards in braille .
look , the problem with commencement speeches
is that they &apos;re boring .
ooh , do you own a t @-@ shirt cannon ?
why would he own a t @-@ shirt cannon ?
i don &apos;t know . why do i own one ?
i think it &apos;s really nice
that you &apos;re sharing this experience with penny .
mm , i thought it &apos;d be fun
to show her my old stomping grounds .
i even know the exact spot where they used to stomp me .
well , now you get to go back as a successful scientist .
with a beautiful girl on your arm .
and a pointy hat sticking out of your eyeball .
how &apos;d you get ready so fast ?
oh , i pack light .
once , i got through an entire spring break
with nothing but a long t @-@ shirt and a belt .
why did you need a belt ?
it &apos;s called an evening look .
i &apos;ve never been to new jersey before .
it gets a bad rap from shows
like jersey shore and real housewives .
《 泽西贵妇的真实生活 》 就是有钱人在秀下限
so it &apos;s not really like that ?
no , it &apos;s like that .
well , i &apos;m excited to show you around .
you think we &apos;ll have time to visit your mom over there ?
yes .
we &apos;ll also have time to put my junk in a garlic press ,
but i &apos;m not doing that either .
i just got an alert .
our flight &apos;s been canceled .
what ?
yeah , looks like there &apos;s a big storm all up the east coast .
well , can we get on another airline ?
i don &apos;t think so .
so , that &apos;s it ? we &apos;re not going ?
i guess not .
well , that sucks .
yeah .
i worked hard on that speech , too .
oh . you could tell it to me .
oh , thank you , but i &apos;m okay .
are you sure ?
i could pretend i &apos;m a high school cheerleader
who can &apos;t control herself around esteemed alumni .
greetings , distinguished cheerleaders .
okay , the wifi extender is on , the camera &apos;s on ,
they &apos;re both on the same network ;
we should be getting an image .
all i see is a black screen .
and my own reflection .
i look sad .
maybe we should recalibrate it .
all right .
step one : rapidly flip the calibration switch
from the fully up to the fully down
positions for at least ten times .
it actually says &quot; at least &quot; ?
yeah .
why would they say &quot; at least &quot; ?
is it ten toggles ?
is it 100 toggles ? you know ?
is it 1,000 toggles ?
10,000 toggles ?
100,000 toggles ?
sheldon !
you see where i &apos;m going with this .
just flip the switch
until the lights on the drone change to solid yellow .
all right , that seems simple enough .
initiating calibration sequence .
one , two , three , four ,
five , six , seven , eight , nine , ten .
well , i suppose ten is technically &quot; at least ten . &quot;
but they &apos;re still getting at least one angry letter .
now i rotate it horizontally
on its center axis until the lights turn green .
initiating rotation sequence .
don &apos;t look at me , initiate .
what does red and yellow mean ?
it means the calibration failed .
we have to start over .
oh . very well .
reinitiating calibration sequence .
one , two , three , four ,
five , six , seven , eight , nine , ten ...
... eleven .
it &apos;s a good thing i didn &apos;t send that letter .
hello , daddy . what &apos;s up ?
not much , just wanted to see how my son &apos;s doing .
very well , thank you .
are you still dating that dermatologist ?
if you could feel how soft my skin is ,
you wouldn &apos;t have to ask .
oh , and there &apos;s something else i wanted to ask you .
why did you spend a month &apos;s rent on a toy helicopter ? !
oh , you &apos;re where that bill goes .
i &apos;m tired of indulging your foolish lifestyle .
it &apos;s time you learned responsibility .
and the only way to teach you that
is to cut off your allowance .
no , daddy , no !
there are lots of other ways to teach me responsibility .
i know , you can give me an egg
and make me take care of it for a week !
no , my mind is made up .
starting now , you &apos;re on your own .
but , daddy , i @-@ i miss my family so much ,
and with you and mummy getting a divorce ,
i feel sad and empty .
buying a little toy every now and then
helps me fill that void .
so while i can &apos;t hug you every day ,
flying that helicopter ...
i &apos;m cutting you off .
just to be clear , financially or mid @-@ sentence ?
no red and yellow ,
no red and yellow .
it &apos;s green !
yay ! we did it !
god , if it &apos;s this much fun to rotate ,
imagine when we fly it .
okay , now all i have to do is rotate it vertically
until the lights turn off .
oh , no !
all right , playtime &apos;s over .
let &apos;s open this baby up .
won &apos;t that void the warranty ?
sheldon , i have a master &apos;s degree in engineering .
i wipe my bottom with warranties .
except for applecare .
that pays for itself in the long run .
hey , where &apos;d you go ?
i got you a little something to cheer you up .
really ?
sex last night , pancakes this morning--
am i dying ?
just open it .
a cap and gown ?
why do i need a cap and gown ?
because you are giving your commencement speech .
what are you talking about ?
i called your old high school
and convinced them to let you give your speech over skype .
really ?
that &apos;s amazing !
and you gave me the robes to give it in .
thank you .
yeah , now about those--
uh , they came from a costume shop ,
and all they had left was sexy graduate ,
so they ...
might be a little short .
short and sexy , that &apos;s my wheelhouse .
yeah !
boy , oh , boy , that &apos;s a lot of pieces .
you know what they all do , right ?
yes , of course .
what about this one ?
well , i ... how familiar are you
with miniaturized integrated logic circuits ?
not very .
that right there is a miniaturized integrated logic circuit .
so , can you get it working ?
i &apos;m an mit @-@ trained engineer .
i &apos;ve built components for the space station .
i thought the zero @-@ gravity toilet didn &apos;t work .
it worked fine ,
it just wasn &apos;t designed for russian cosmonauts
and their potato @-@ based diet .
hey , guys .
hello .
i have to return the helicopter . my father ...
what did you do ? !
well , don &apos;t worry .
he went to mit .
he can solve any problem ,
as long as it doesn &apos;t originate in a russian man &apos;s colon .
i don &apos;t freaking believe this !
relax , it &apos;ll be fine .
no , you have to put this back together right now ,
so i can return it !
you can &apos;t return it .
howard wiped his bottom with the warranty .
what ? !
i think metaphorically .
but he was in the bathroom for a while .
howard , my father cut me off .
i have to get my money back for this !
calm down .
okay .
okay , you &apos;re right .
it &apos;s time for me to step up
and take responsibility for my life .
be a man .
hello , mummy .
hello , rajesh .
what a nice surprise .
well , i &apos;ve been thinking about you .
how are you doing ? are you happy , mummy ?
such a sweet boy for asking .
can &apos;t believe you come from the poison seed of your father .
well , i like to think i take mostly after you .
anyway , speaking of daddy ,
i had a very strange conversation with him .
he said he couldn &apos;t afford to send me money anymore
because of his active social life .
what does that mean , &quot; active social life &quot; ?
well , let &apos;s not talk about him
or whatever shenanigans he may or may not be up to .
let &apos;s talk about you .
rajesh , is your father seeing someone ?
all i know , mummy , is that he &apos;s a single wealthy doctor ,
and now , for some reason ,
there &apos;s no money for your little boy .
well , however much money your father was giving you ,
i &apos;ll give you more .
thank you , mummy , i love you !
helicopters for everybody !
what &apos;s taking so long ?
i don &apos;t think this is gonna work .
just let me see .
sweetie , you know you &apos;re supposed to wear clothes
underneath a graduation gown .
a : surprised you know that .
b : i wanted to look like a sexy graduate for you .
well , you do .
thank you .
yeah .
you &apos;re gonna be on skype ; they &apos;re not gonna see your legs .
well , i &apos;m gonna go put on some pants just in case .
but i have to say , this is very freeing .
add a belt and i &apos;ll take you someplace nice .
done and done .
okay , i think i &apos;ve narrowed it down
to a faulty pin on the onboard communication chip .
very impressive .
you know , when you &apos;re done with that ,
can you look at this ?
it doesn &apos;t make smoke anymore .
one toy at a time .
mm . sorry .
ah , maybe it &apos;s for the best .
i hear locomotive smoke
is the second leading cause of death among train aficionados .
what &apos;s the first one ?
suicide .
wrong .
obesity .
i have the tool you wanted .
thank you .
you guys don &apos;t have to go to the trouble .
i &apos;m back in the money now ;
i can just buy another helicopter .
it &apos;s not about the money .
it &apos;s about solving a problem .
it &apos;s why i became an engineer .
it &apos;s what i like to do , it &apos;s what i &apos;m trained to do .
it &apos;s who i am .
oh , look at you-- the little engineer that could .
why don &apos;t you just call tech support ?
hey !
not cool !
what ?
there &apos;s two kinds of people in this world :
those who call tech support
and those who make fun of the people who call tech support .
i call tech support all the time .
you call tech support !
what a baby !
and now , for our commencement address ,
one of our most distinguished alumni ,
noted caltech physicist dr. leonard hofstadter .
members of the faculty , students ,
i &apos;m excited to speak to you today .
i can &apos;t help but remember the last time i was in this auditorium .
two guys from the lacrosse team
played keep @-@ away with my asthma inhaler .
but enough about my ten @-@ year reunion .
i &apos;d also like to take a moment
to thank my beautiful fiancee
for to helping make this speech possible ,
even though weather nearly prevented it .
oh . hello .
i @-@ i didn &apos;t know he was gonna point it at me ,
so ...
don &apos;t do drugs and stay in school .
they &apos;re graduating .
okay , bye !
all right , the power supply is reconnected .
i think we &apos;re back in business .
let &apos;s just run a few tests before we take it outside .
sheldon , we got wifi ?
check .
gps ?
check .
battery charged ?
check .
four hours of our lives gone ? check .
all right . all systems go .
in five ...
... four , three , two , one .
that &apos;s what my train used to do .
ready to call tech support ?
give me the number .
probably wind up talking to some foreign guy
who &apos;s reading from the same manual i have .
it &apos;s my father , you jerks .
hello , daddy .
what did you say to your mother ?
nothing .
i was just calling to check in ,
make sure she &apos;s doing okay .
well , after talking to you ,
she seems to think i &apos;m some sort of playboy .
really ?
i don &apos;t know where she &apos;d get an idea like that .
you know mummy and her crazy imagination .
i &apos;m so lucky i take after you .
you think you take after me ?
well , i try to .
i certainly wouldn &apos;t be a scientist
if you hadn &apos;t been my role model .
who wants to go to vegas in a real helicopter ? !
it was l. frank baum who said ,
&quot; no thief , however skillful , can rob one of knowledge ,
and that is why knowledge is the best and safest treasure . &quot;
wow , i &apos;m boring myself .
sorry , i can &apos;t see any of your faces right now ,
but i bet they look like this .
uh , you know , i @-@ i wrote an entire speech
to say how high school prepares you
and what a wonderful place it is ,
but i hated it .
maybe high school &apos;s great if you look like this ...
... but i didn &apos;t even feel like i existed at that school .
and now that i think about it ,
i bet a lot of you feel the same way .
so , for the remainder of my speech ,
this is for the invisible kids .
uh , maybe you never fit in .
or maybe you &apos;re the smallest kid in the school ,
or the heaviest or the weirdest .
maybe you &apos;re graduating
and you still haven &apos;t had your first kiss .
by the way , 19 ;
and geraldine coco , wherever you are , thank you .
maybe you don &apos;t have any friends .
and guess what ? that &apos;s okay .
while all the popular kids are off doing--
whatever , i don &apos;t know what they were doing
&apos;cause i was never there ...
i &apos;ll @-@ i &apos;ll tell you later .
my point is ,
while you &apos;re spending all this time on your own ,
building computers or practicing your cello ,
what you &apos;re really doing
is becoming interesting .
and when people finally do notice you ,
they &apos;re gonna find someone a lot cooler than they thought .
and for those of you who were popular in high school ,
it &apos;s over , sorry .
thank you and congratulations .
your call is important to us .
all our technicians are busy helping other customers .
please stay on the line
and someone will be with you shortly .
what happened to me ?
when did i become an old man
baffled by modern technology ?
next thing you know ,
i &apos;ll be hitching my pants up to my armpits
and complaining about
the awful music the kids are listening to .
it is awful , isn &apos;t it ?
listen to that noise .
hang on , hang on .
it &apos;s working ! i did it !
how &apos;d you do that ?
no idea , but i did it !
maybe you shouldn &apos;t be flying it inside .
well , i &apos;m not flying it !
then who is ?
i don &apos;t know !
must be getting a wifi signal from somewhere else !
initiate landing sequence ! initiate landing sequence !
hey , the camera &apos;s working !
oh , look , it &apos;s me .
tech support , can i help you ?
yes , it &apos;s a robot uprising ! call the police !
so you really think they liked it ?
oh , sweetie , it was the best speech i ...
don &apos;t worry , everyone in here is safe .
