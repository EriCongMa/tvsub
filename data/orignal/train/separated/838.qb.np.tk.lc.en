he was average size , thin , wispy blond hair .
oddly shaped , kind of came to a point .
uh , what does that mean ?
top heavy .
a bit of a scar as if like from a hook or something .
gross . ugh . uh , anything else ?
i think that about does it . you want me to describe
what his face and body looked like ?
yeah , that &apos;d be ...

i &apos;m not even the one that called you guys .
man !
and to be fair ,
i knew he was talking about a penis the whole time . see ?
that is way too real !
aggressively detailed .
i had to guess on the testicles ,
&apos;cause he hadn &apos;t described &apos; em .
you know what it is ? it &apos;s just that there &apos;s no turning back .
i mean , who am i when i leave this apartment ?
&quot; mrs. cece schmidt ? &quot;
&quot; cece schmidt &quot; sounds like the mayor of an evil swiss town .
it does .
oh , my god .
did i tell you that schmidt thinks
that we should drop our last names
and make up a new one ?
he is currently , at the moment ,
leaning towards zenith and telluride .
i don &apos;t hate telluride .
getting married is just such a big leap .
you leap big all the time !
you moved here at 18
with nothing but a bunch of chokers .
isn &apos;t it amazing ? !
and it &apos;s mine .
yeah , there &apos;s also a knife stuck in the wall .
oh , look ! someone left a spoon with some rock candy in it .
i wonder what flavor it is .

that was a page @-@ turning noise .
um , yup , i see the graph .
jess ?
do you remember rosarito ? !
we don &apos;t have much to go on , but i &apos;ll run your description .
hopefully , dunston wouldn &apos;t have spilled coffee all over the radio .
you know , he brews his own and drinks it out of a sandwich bag .
winston ,
just call aly and tell her
that you want to be partners again .
look , guys , i ... i cannot .
i just cannot hear about aly &apos;s boyfriend
and his ass that don &apos;t quit , okay ?
my ass don &apos;t quit ! what about my ass ? !

all right . three . three . two , one ,
zero , negative one . - damn it ! - that ... !
winston , dunston ! dunston !

i got to say ...
he never comes in twice in a night .
i just hope he &apos;s okay .
i &apos;m alarmed by how connected to this man you feel .
i just hope the best for him .
i am so dead .
if i don &apos;t find this binder ,
i &apos;m gonna need a really good excuse . oh , wait , cece ? mm .
can you break my arm just a little bit ?
no !
you &apos;re right . it &apos;s better if i do it myself .
okay , you know what ?
hey hey , can i just throw something out there ?
what if you quit ?
i want to quit .
god , do i want to quit , but i can &apos;t ! i can &apos;t !
you can quit . because this becky lady is making you miserable .
you were always someone who loved their job .
it &apos;s my first day of teaching in l.a.
and i &apos;m giving my job
a big fat &quot; a ... &quot;
you remember the last time i was unemployed ?
i ran out of things to knit .
i knit a condom .
oh , the yarn @-@ dom .
i pray this was never used .
okay , remember earlier when you told me to leap ?
you should leap .
i don &apos;t leap .
i take small planned steps , like an arthritic dog .
really ?
the last listing is a loft downtown .
bad area .
the ad just says it &apos;s &quot; sunsoaked and beige @-@ y . &quot;
i don &apos;t know . they seem like three nice girls .
and now i am marrying one of those girls
and totally freaking out about it .
you know who you need to talk to , right ?
yes . definitely . winston .
no .
what the hell ?
what ?
i &apos;m gone for two months , and all of a sudden
winston &apos;s a bridesmaid ? never mind .
you need to call schmidt .
no . no , i can &apos;t call him and tell him that i &apos;m scared .
i think that that &apos;s what getting married is .
sharing all this ,
all the things you &apos;re afraid of ,
all the things that embarrass you ,
weak doggy @-@ style guy .
you got to call schmidt .
all right .
a voice call , jess ?
let me guess , a family of ducks is crossing the street .
no , no , no , no , no , no . it &apos;s me . it &apos;s me . um , so ...
i love you but i am freaking out about getting married .
cece , what ? what &apos;s @-@ what &apos;s going on ? what &apos;s happening ?
well , i just ... i don &apos;t ... i don &apos;t ...
oh , no . um , jess , it &apos;s becky . it &apos;s becky .
what @-@ what @-@ what do you want me to do ?
what do i do ? what do i do ?
don &apos;t answer it . don &apos;t answer it .
what ? who &apos;s becky ? what &apos;s a becky ? what &apos;s happening ?
don &apos;t answer it .
do not answer it .
i &apos;m gonna answer it .
what ?
hello ! hi . uh , yeah ,
so , this is cece parikh , and you are treating my friend very badly .
what ? put jess on .
no , no , no , no . you are done using my friend , okay ?
so she ... quits .
i what ?
she what ?
i what ?
that &apos;s right !
jess quits !
nailed it !
oh , my god , the binder . it &apos;s under the couch .
no , no , no . we handled it .
it &apos;s our perp .
aly , i want you back . i ...
i @-@ i want you back .
are you trying to tell me something or doing a jackson 5 song ?
i miss having you as my partner .
do you want to tell me why you left ?
&apos;cause you never did . and , honestly , winston ,
that really sucked .
i left because you hurt my feelings
when you kept talking about ...
you kept talking about ...
... how much you hate my music . you know ?
this is about your pure moods cd ?
that &apos;s it . that &apos;s all . it &apos;s the only reason why i left .
okay . i mean , that thing makes me wish i was born
without the ability to hear music ,
but if it means that much to you ,
i &apos;ll listen to it .
i @-@ i @-@ i appreciate that .
look , you &apos;re the only partner i want .
you make me ...
laugh and whatever .
i don &apos;t know . i suck at compliments .
yeah .
partners ?
partners .
shake it . don &apos;t just hold it .
yeah . sorry .
i think that was dunston .
how did he not see us ?
no idea .
oh , yeah , he &apos;s night @-@ blind .
dunston !
it &apos;s done . everything you asked for .
and , principal cavatappi ,
i &apos;m very sorry for what my friend said . i ...
oh , i know . i would never let you quit anyway .
can you come up with some thoughts on the science curriculum
for the superintendant and sign my name ?
yeah . sure . yes .
you know what ? no !
i can &apos;t . no .
nope . um , because i quit .
i hope you have a minor career setback ,
learn from it , relocate ,
and ultimately have a very nice life , becky .
do i want to know this story ?
i hope so ,
because we &apos;re about to spend the rest of our lives together .
so you &apos;re gonna have to hear all my stories .
i want to spend the rest of my life hearing all your stories .
until , of course , my hearing goes out and i get tinnitus .
do you know dave letterman has tinnitus ?
about @-@ about what i said on the phone ...
i &apos;m a little freaked out , too .
you are ?
yes .
and it has nothing to do with how much i love you .
exactly .
or how much i want to get married .
exactly .
we &apos;ll be scared together .
and we &apos;ll be really happy together , too .
and we &apos;ll be really annoyed together ,
knowing that we &apos;re living with three other people and a cat .
also , i think there &apos;s another cat .
winston &apos;s being very evasive about it , but ...
it &apos;s a foster cat .
i think it &apos;s helping him get over the whole aly thing .
i don &apos;t care .
well , i guess this is it .
i thought jess would be here , but ...
you know , okay , end of an era .
yeah .
have you ever been here before ?
this is maybe my second time .
i nursed my pippy back to health here .
yeah . i remember .
all right . i &apos;m gonna give you a minute .
okay .
cece , cece , cece .
do you want to do the honors or should i ?
go for it .
okay . one , two , three .
we did it !
oh , my god , there &apos;s hair on the end !
put it back ! put it back !
do you speak russian ?
nope .
