i gave the money to ana so she &apos;d change her story .
you bribed her ?
i &apos;ll tell the d.a.
i want $ 10,000 .
that freaking woman . i could kill her .
you are gonna stay as far away from that woman as possible .
you saw ana gutierrez in an argument
the night that she went missing ?
is this the guy ?
yeah , this is the guy .
donald isn &apos;t my dad ?
not according to the birth certificate .
it says robert quinn ?
until there is signed consent from robert quinn ,
the adoption of callie jacob is denied .
told you i was gonna hit you where it hurt .
your bones are shattered in several places .
he &apos;s gonna need surgery .
he &apos;s a pianist .
our concern right now is making sure he can still use it at all .
what are you doing up ?
can &apos;t sleep . you ?
i remember when you used to crawl into bed with me
when that happened .
yeah , i thought i &apos;d , uh , spare you tonight .
hm . then you &apos;d end up sprawled out sideways ,
your feet next to my head , kicking me in the face all night long .
see , i remember it as you headbutting my feet , actually .
really ? then mama would viciously attack your elbows with her ribs ?
really ?
yeah . sorry about that . sounds terrible .
it was pretty nice .
back when that was all it took to make you feel safe .
how &apos;s it feel ?
about the same .
still numb ?
what if i , um ...
... can &apos;t ever play again ...
... like i used to ?
honey , don &apos;t think like that .
you can &apos;t think like that , ok ?
you just have to keep trying , keep at it , you know ?
don &apos;t you ever give up on your dream , you hear me ?
第二季第二集
we don &apos;t have any oranges ?
sorry . i think i took the last one .
and the bread ? all we have are the ends .
this is like the hunger games .
you do know those books aren &apos;t actually about food , right ?
sorry , guys , i &apos;ll hit the market today , i promise .
good morning .
morning . are we out of ... ?
everything !
bacon , we &apos;ve got bacon . have some bacon . come on .
i made it last night .
i want everybody home for family dinner tonight .
five p.m. yes ?
wrestling won &apos;t be done ... - what about dance ?
do i hear six p.m. ? anybody ?
i have work , i was just gonna eat there with daphne .
but i will eat here instead .
um , i &apos;m supposed to go to the batting cages with connor .
batting cages , as in baseball ?
yeah , connor and his dad go all the time .
and they invited me .
i think that &apos;s great , sweetheart .
i never knew you were a baseball guy .
i haven &apos;t really played that much .
but who knows , maybe i &apos;m really good .
yeah , maybe .
just have fun , baby , that &apos;s all that counts .
so , mom , i was thinking about what you said last night .
about not giving up ?
right .
and i think i want the surgery .
try to repair the nerve damage .
ok . um ...
the doctor said that it &apos;s a difficult and complex procedure .
and if things don &apos;t go as hoped ,
your hand could actually get worse .
yeah , i mean , she said there &apos;s a chance of that .
she also said that if the surgery did cause damage ,
that it could ... it could actually be permanent .
you &apos;ve got almost 95 percent function now .
that &apos;s better than the doctors even hoped .
but if i &apos;m gonna play piano ,
though , i need 100 percent .
so i &apos;d like to give it a shot .
so we agreed ? you &apos;re good ?
yeah . it &apos;s the right call .
ok .
ok .
i &apos;ll let brandon know .
ok .
oh , and tell him if he wants to come by ,
that , you know , i &apos;m here .
i will .
ok . gotta hit the shower .
let yourself out ?
yeah .
thanks a lot for letting me barge in like this .
appreciate it .
oh , no worries .
ok .
you know , there &apos;s something i wanted to ask you ,
something brandon told me about the night before he was attacked .
mike was drinking ?
yeah . he had a little slip ,
but he &apos;s been sober ever since , going to meetings every day .
oh , that &apos;s great . good for him .
brandon said that he was in a fight .
yeah , i guess so .
he blacked out so he didn &apos;t really remember anything .
oh , gosh ...
but there was blood on his hands when you found him ? that &apos;s ...
a little . he was fine .
was it his blood ?
stef .
if you have questions about mike &apos;s sobriety , you have to ask him .
of course . of course i should . you &apos;re right . sorry .
thank you so much for the coffee . appreciate it .
all right , jude , just keep your eye on the ball , buddy .
takes a little getting used to . just hang in there , kid .
um , you might wanna hang on to the bat a little tighter too .
here , grab another one , all right ?
hey , connor , let &apos;s go , come on .
throw a token in there , let &apos;s see what you got . come on , buddy .
what &apos;d we talk about this year ?
balance and torque .
that &apos;s right , come on . let &apos;s go ! see what you got .
hey , your head &apos;s moving all over the place ,
like this . you &apos;re all over .
connor , pivot the back foot . pivot like this . pivot .
that &apos;s better .
hey , way to go . nice hit . good job .
look , that front foot &apos;s gotta land in the same place every time .
it slipped .
no excuses ! come on !
hey , what &apos;s the matter with you ?
your focus is all over the place today .
need a refill ? a soda ?
uh , it &apos;s a vanilla shake .
oh , yeah . we don &apos;t do refills on shakes .
yeah . i figured .
yeah , vanilla &apos;s my favorite .
it has to be really good vanilla , though .
you should , um , check out the place down the street ,
in the mini @-@ mall on olamar . best shakes in town .
do you work every day after school ? that &apos;s gotta be tough .
um , no , just three days .
my moms don &apos;t want me to work any more than that .
moms ?
yeah .
cool .
it is .
oh , don &apos;t worry , i &apos;ll grab that .
oh , thanks . see you soon .
oh ... down the street , i &apos;m telling you .
you &apos;re really good .
not good enough .
i thought you did great , way better than me .
i &apos;m supposed to be good at this .
damn !
what ?
someone left us a hundred @-@ dollar tip !
what ?
a hundred dollars , yo !
oh , my god ! who do you think it was ?
i don &apos;t know . vanilla milkshake ? he sure was chatting you up .
please .
come on , girl . you know he likes you .
shut up .
he wants some of that .
daphne !
if he keeps giving us hundred dollars bills ,
he can have all the vanilla milkshake he want !
i just don &apos;t understand why we have to do any of this .
well , if you want him to sign off , these are his terms .
yes , but it makes no sense .
it &apos;s not like she &apos;s asking him for anything .
sit down , love .
so , callie , we heard back from robert quinn &apos;s lawyer .
ok .
and he won &apos;t sign anything until there &apos;s a dna test ,
to prove that you &apos;re his daughter . so ...
i seriously can &apos;t handle
sharing the gym with the wrestlers any more .
the gym smells like feet .
well , that &apos;s appetizing .
and all the boys ever do is stare at us . pervs .
well , it &apos;s not awesome for me either ,
hearing guys talk about how hot my sister is .
which guys ?
besides ,
i see the dance team checking us out too .
that hayley girl , can &apos;t take her eyes off me .
oh , yeah ? hayley , the one with the college boyfriend hayley ?
she dates boys in college ?
none of the girls on the dance team date boys in high school .
oh . we &apos;ll see about that .
better not let emma hear you .
please , i can handle emma .
what ?
i pretty sure no one handles emma but emma .
hey , brandon ! we &apos;d like to eat , sometime this year !
jude , how did the batting cages go ?
do we need to call the padres ,
see if they need another big hit in their lineup ?
i don &apos;t think so .
oh , come on ! planning my retirement .
bread me .
oh ! guys !
so we , uh , make an appointment yet for the hand surgeon ?
uh , no .
why not ?
well , i talked it all over with your father .
is this about money or something ?
isn &apos;t that what the settlement from vico is for ?
fix my freaking hand ?
no , brandon , it &apos;s not about money .
we just , um ...
we just feel that it &apos;s a little too risky , brandon .
and , uh ... your father and i are saying no .
i don &apos;t get this .
it &apos;s my hand , my money , my life .
and i wanna play piano again . like , really play .
why is this so hard to understand ? i want the surgery .
brandon , we are eating dinner .
can we please discuss this later ?
yeah , well , i &apos;m not hungry .
so you talked to mike ?
this afternoon .
and you just ... decided ?
shouldn &apos;t it be brandon &apos;s decision ?
he &apos;s the one who got his ass kicked .
i wouldn &apos;t put it that way , but that &apos;s a good point .
what if it doesn &apos;t work ?
i mean , what if he can &apos;t use his fingers at all ?
look , mike and i talked through all of this .
and you made your decision . got it .
nice coat rack .
yeah , well , might as well use it for something .
brandon .
i mean , you can still play , right ?
not classical . not the way i did .
ok , so all music is dead to you then ?
no , but ...
well , it sounds like that &apos;s what you &apos;re risking ,
if you have this surgery .
ok . look , i had a future .
that &apos;s not something you just throw away .
but what if you &apos;re not throwing it away ?
what if it &apos;s just ... a different future ?
what if it doesn &apos;t have to be that way , though ?
i mean , why is everyone focusing on the worst @-@ case scenario ?
ok , yeah , i &apos;m sorry . i hear you . it &apos;s ...
i hate it when people assume the worst .
like your birth dad ?
yeah , like him .
i guess he owns , like ,
this big company or something .
so he is making me take this dna test
and ... and sign this agreement
that says that i &apos;ll never sue him .
that &apos;s crazy .
like i want his money ?
just sign the papers , and then sail off on your yacht
and i promise i will never think of you ever again .
and i have to see him .
why ?
&apos;cause we both have to be there at the test ,
to make sure that nothing gets switched or whatever .
i know you didn &apos;t want to know anything about him .
guess i don &apos;t have a choice .
some people do .
just think about it .
i &apos;m really busy , timothy . what is it you need ?
i , um , wanted to let you know
that i &apos;ve been asked to represent the teachers
on the search committee for the new principal .
i know that you have , um , thrown your hat in the ring , and ...
and you should recuse yourself .
what i was going to say was
i plan on being completely professional
and keeping any personal feelings out of it .
and i hope you will , too .
so i &apos;m just supposed to trust you on this ?
after you gave me your word you would sign the donor contract ,
and then suddenly decided that you couldn &apos;t ?
yeah .
演唱者 william fitzsimmons
my client will be here any minute .
and my client was pulled from school for this .
i apologize , mr. quinn &apos;s been held up .
he won &apos;t be able to make it .
will it be sufficient if you tell mr.quinn
everything was done by the book ?
absolutely .
he no @-@ showed ? are you kidding ?
what a jerk . he makes you jump through all these dumb hoops ,
the least he could do is show up .
i didn &apos;t think i would care .
you know , i had a plan .
i wasn &apos;t even gonna look at him .
and when i realized he wasn &apos;t coming at all ,
i just got this awful feeling in the pit of my stomach .
he doesn &apos;t even want to see me .
i just hate that he can make me feel like that .
i know . that &apos;s the worst .
at least when my birth mom bails
i can tell myself it &apos;s &apos; cause she &apos;s a drug addict , right ?
jealous .
don &apos;t hate .
i did kinda want to see him , though .
just once .
just to know .
hey , uh , do you have any plans tonight ?
um ... no , why ? why do you care ?
are you so shallow
that you &apos;re afraid your social status will be diminished
by a big brother who doesn &apos;t go out on a thursday night ?
yes .
no , but really , jesus and emma are going to
some all @-@ ages show tonight at the groundspace
to see this band that emma &apos;s friend is in .
now , callie wants to come , but because wyatt &apos;s out of town ,
i &apos;m going with her so she doesn &apos;t feel like a third wheel .
so why do you need me ?
we need a ride .
i feel so loved .
um ... i don &apos;t know , why don &apos;t you ride with emma ?
we &apos;re trying not to be third and fourth wheels , remember ?
you have to come .
to listen to some high school garage band ?
sounds like torture .
at least you don &apos;t need a fake id to get in .
too soon .
come on .
so ?
girl , please .
no one says no to miss thing . he &apos;s in .
this better not suck .
pull these two tables together .
ok .
emma !
hey !
you brought a posse . nice .
yeah .
hey , man .
hey , man . this is your band ?
yeah . it &apos;s me , jasper and my cousin lou .
not exactly arcade fire , but we can play a little .
hey , you doing all right ?
oh , yeah . i &apos;m ok .
it &apos;s not quite where i want it to be ,
but hopefully one more surgery and i should be back to top form .
that &apos;s great to hear . we &apos;re on soon .
lou just pulled up . punctual as always .
a little help , here !
and that &apos;s the end of my 20 @-@ second break .
good luck , man .
so , emma , what kind of music do they play ?
it &apos;s like an &apos; 80s pop vibe mixed with a little black keys .
cool .
this is gonna be painful .
be nice .
so , emma , how do you know mat ?
i think what she &apos;s trying to ask is , does he have a girlfriend ?
that &apos;s definitely what she &apos;s trying to ask .
that &apos;s not what i was trying to ask .
do you guys want me to ask ? hey , mat !
no ! that is not what i was asking .
he &apos;s single .
lou ?
yeah . lucy .
we &apos;re someone &apos;s little sister .
you know the old saying :
yesterday &apos;s history , tomorrow &apos;s a mystery .
so tonight ? we rock your faces off .
* i *
* i don &apos;t wanna waste your time *
* and i don &apos;t need you wasting mine *
* so leave it on the front line *
not so painful now , is it ?
* drive *
* pull back the arrow and fly *
* we can risk it all tonight *
* tomorrow &apos;s never gone *
* take it or leave it , show me every secret *
* crash on me like before that with a little more *
* save it or waste it , long as you can taste it *
* i &apos;m salt water and you &apos;re the ocean floor *
* i &apos;ve waited for you so long *
you &apos;re really burning the midnight oil , huh ?
i got to .
i &apos;m doing the work of two people
until they can hire someone else .
speaking of which ,
guess who &apos;s on the search committee for the new principal ?
who ?
timothy .
that seems complicated , doesn &apos;t it ?
listen , i know that ...
... we could use the money , but , um ,
do you really want to be principal ?
it seems like it &apos;s a lot of work , and you are pregnant . you know ?
is it really the right time for this , right now ?
no , you &apos;re right , it &apos;s a terrible time .
but jobs like this don &apos;t come along very often ,
especially ones where i have the inside track .
so yeah , i want it .
and i don &apos;t want timothy to ruin it for me .
i got it .
hey , come on in .
hey , mike .
what &apos;s up ?
uh , just work stuff . can i talk to you for a sec ?
i &apos;ve got some &quot; work stuff &quot; of my own to finish .
are you building a case to keep brandon away from me ?
no . what are you ... ?
then why are you pumping dani for information ?
you know i fell off the wagon , why not just come to me , stef ?
i wasn &apos;t pumping dani for ...
you didn &apos;t just drink , mike , you got into a fight .
you had blood on your hands .
so what ?
you afraid i &apos;m gonna hurt brandon or something ?
no , mike , i &apos;m worried about you .
i &apos;m fine . ok ?
i &apos;m getting it together .
where &apos;d the blood come from ?
it &apos;s stupid . i got into a fight .
at the bar .
some guy was bothering the waitress , and ...
i must have broke his nose .
it was bleeding like crazy .
so you did ...
so you didn &apos;t see ana that night ?
is that what this is about ?
you think it was her blood ?
you were so mad at her , mike .
which is why i stayed away , just like we talked about .
yeah , you didn &apos;t talk to her ? you didn &apos;t see her at all ?
you didn &apos;t try and scare her off
so she wouldn &apos;t turn brandon in ... ?
stef , i swear . i did not talk to ana ,
i certainly didn &apos;t lay a hand on her .
ok . sorry .
ok .
step together .
raise together .
right , left , and turn ! and pose .
i know what you &apos;re doing .
what ? hanging out with my brothers and sisters ?
listening to a little live music ?
look , i think it &apos;s nice and all , but i don &apos;t ...
where were those dance moves when we were up there playing ?
great show .
you were awesome !
it was amazing , really . but we have to go .
we do ?
we do .
good job , man .
what &apos;d you think ?
it was really good .
come on , you &apos;re a musician .
you actually know what you &apos;re talking about .
bring it .
uh ... ok .
your energy was really good .
the songs are good , but , um , i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t think they were being
articulated as well as they could be , i guess .
i know we &apos;re not as tight as middle school honors band .
you guys used to play together ?
yeah , in seventh grade .
well then know that brandon is a seriously great pianist .
like , seriously great . like ,
even when i &apos;m so sick of hearing him practice
the same thing over and over again ,
that i think if i hear it one more time .
i might puncture my own eardrum ,
i can step back and recognize that it &apos;s actually pretty amazing .
oh , i remember . he &apos;s super good .
he writes , too .
we could use your help with something , actually .
no , i don &apos;t think ...
tightening up the sound ,
maybe get a few of the songs charted .
so , what , we play the same stale version every time ?
well , that &apos;s only how it starts .
once you know it , you can really play around .
unless you guys like the fact that you most of the time
sound like you &apos;re rehearsing , basically .
you &apos;re welcome not to attend our shows ,
if you don &apos;t like what we do .
no , he didn &apos;t mean , um ... no , he &apos;s a musician too .
classical .
well , maybe you &apos;re just a little too buttoned @-@ up
to get what we &apos;re about .
wow . she &apos;s ...
intense . yeah . and i &apos;ve got , like , 30 seconds
to follow her before she quits the band again .
but dude , you got to come jam with us sometime .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s my thing . and it &apos;s definitely not her thing .
just think about it .
we could probably use a little buttoning @-@ up .
what is it ?
we &apos;re in a car .
so ?
so , like , our first time shouldn &apos;t be in a car .
don &apos;t worry about me .
i don &apos;t need the whole candles and roses thing if you don &apos;t .
i don &apos;t .
great .
so , come here and kiss me .
could you ... less tongue ?
sure , sure .
slower .
ok , switch .
演唱者 the delta riggs
kiss my neck .
you know what ?
it &apos;s almost time for my curfew .
we better ... i better get home . ok ?
小妹妹乐队
小妹妹乐队
that &apos;s really nice . who is that ?
just some band some kids at school started .
i miss hearing music pouring from your room .
it &apos;s always been one of my favorite things ,
even when you were little , and you weren &apos;t very good .
yeah , well ...
you know , for what it &apos;s worth ,
i think mom and your dad are wrong on this one .
i think ....
i think if you want the operation , it &apos;s your hand .
the only one who knows how it feels is you .
did i really just hear you tell
our son that you think he should get the surgery ?
罗伯特 · 奎因 圣地亚哥
this is not what we do ,
lena . what happened to &quot; unified front &quot; ?
i , honestly , i disagree .
fine , but you do not go undermining me with our son .
our son ?
yes .
or your son ?
look , brandon is 16 . he &apos;s old enough to know
that we don &apos;t always agree on everything .
and i wanted him to know that
if he still believes in this dream , then so do i.
it &apos;s not a dream , lena , it is a fantasy .
do you really want to see brandon devastated again ?
we can &apos;t protect our kids from disappointment .
and if it happens , and i &apos;m not
entirely convinced that it will in this situation ,
then we help him , we help him to learn from it .
well , you have fun with that ,
because after all of the disappointments
he &apos;s had over the last few months ,
i am sick and tired of teaching him that lesson .
hey . so guess what ? moms just bought me dawn of armageddon 4 .
haven &apos;t even played it yet . we can open it when you come over .
i can &apos;t spend the night tonight .
oh , ok . what about saturday ?
i kinda can &apos;t sleep over at your house ... ever .
what ?
it &apos;s my dad , ok ? he won &apos;t let me .
why ?
i ...
it &apos;s ok , just ... tell me .
i know it &apos;s not true , but my dad won &apos;t let me sleep over
at your house because he thinks you &apos;re gay .
i know you &apos;re not .
i just ... i have to do what he says .
i &apos;m sorry .
what if i was gay ?
what do you mean ?
would you not want to sleep over at my house
if i really was gay ?
演唱者 william fitzsimmons
so ... don &apos;t worry about last night .
it was almost curfew , and there was a lot of pressure .
but you still want to ... right ?
of course .
um , saturday night , we &apos;ll do it the right way , ok ?
yeah , i &apos;d like that .
i got it all planned out .
we can go to a really nice dinner . totally on me .
and then afterwards , maybe we can go to the beach .
the beach ?
yeah . what &apos;s wrong with the beach ?
have you ever had sex on the beach ?
i know it &apos;s supposed to be all romantic and stuff ,
but there &apos;s sand everywhere ,
in all your business , and bugs . it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s pretty terrible .
ok .
what ?
nothing . it &apos;s just ,
you &apos;re so bossy sometimes , it &apos;s kind of a turn @-@ off .
bossy ?
well , i only said that because ...
no , that &apos;s cool , you know .
i &apos;ll just , like , turn my brain off whenever we &apos;re together .
that &apos;s not what i meant .
so what ?
did i , like , trick you into this or something ?
did i pretend to be someone else that you ... ?
no . i mean , i like how independent you are .
i just feel like sometimes
it &apos;s kinda like you &apos;re dating yourself .
like it doesn &apos;t even matter whether i &apos;m here or not .
well , congrats . it doesn &apos;t anymore .
emma . emma !
your secret admirer &apos;s outside .
it &apos;s all about the benjamins , baby .
just what do you think
$ 100 is gonna buy you ? &apos; cause you know what ?
i don &apos;t want your guilt money .
yeah , i know who you are . you &apos;re robert quinn .
i googled you , when you didn &apos;t show .
ok , look .
i &apos;m sorry .
i took your dna test .
what else do you want from me ?
five minutes .
so you &apos;ve been , what , stalking me ?
i just wanted to see you .
if i wanted the best vanilla shakes ,
i would have gone down the street , right ?
i &apos;m sorry ...
look , you should know that i
didn &apos;t want to put you through that test . ok ?
it &apos;s my family &apos;s lawyers , they insisted on it .
i don &apos;t want your money , ok ?
i want your signature on a piece of paper .
as soon i saw you , i knew there was no need for a dna test .
you &apos;re my daughter .
i know this is really , really confusing . ok ?
believe me , i get it .
but you need to understand that before i was served those papers ,
i had no idea you even existed .
no .
my dad , donald , he told me that
you left after you found out mom was pregnant .
no . i never should have left your mom ,
that &apos;s the worst thing i &apos;ve ever done in my life .
but i swear i did not know she was pregnant .
i loved your mom a lot .
i brought you this .
just read it when you have the time .
are you going to sign the papers ?
as soon as my attorneys say it &apos;s ok .
i gotta get back to work .
hey , just wanted to let you
know we found a body near that halfway house .
no id yet , but it could be the woman you &apos;re looking for .
that was pretty cool .
oh , thanks . it &apos;s ... it &apos;s nothing .
oh , come on . it &apos;s not just nothing .
so your mom and i &apos;ve been talking .
and i know you know that
we &apos;re not exactly on the same page on this .
but i don &apos;t know what to do , b.
if we let you have the surgery and it causes more damage ,
are you gonna blame us when you &apos;re older
because we let you make this decision when you were only 16 ?
and if we don &apos;t , are we getting in the way of your dream ?
i would never blame you .
but i would .
i &apos;m your mom , b , ok ? i &apos;m supposed to protect you .
and , uh ...
... that &apos;s a lot harder ... these days .
i don &apos;t know what the right choice is .
so if you want the surgery , i will talk to your dad ,
and we will consult with some other specialists
so that we get a better picture of what we &apos;re looking at . ok ?
we &apos;re not saying yes .
but , uh , we &apos;re not saying no either .
um ... i think i &apos;m gonna wait .
yeah , maybe ...
maybe the feeling will come back on its own , right ?
that &apos;s what you want ?
ok .
i love you , b.
i love you too , mom .
i &apos;m proud of you .
so , what are you up to tonight ?
think i &apos;m gonna work on this , actually .
sounds like a plan .
