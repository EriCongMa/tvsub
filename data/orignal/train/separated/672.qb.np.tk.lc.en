who are you ?
nolan ross . friend of your father &apos;s .
he wanted you to have something .
my father was a murderer and a liar .
so why would i trust you ?
&apos;cause that &apos;s just what they want you to believe .
forget everything that you think you know , amanda .
your dad was protecting you .
when deception cuts this deep , someone has to pay .
please let me out of here !
you destroyed a man &apos;s career .
no ! no !
you scare me .
good .
you &apos;re driving me crazy tonight , amanda .
is that right ?
let &apos;s get outta here .
no , i want to dance .
you just gonna tease me all night ?
get your hands off me .
what &apos;s your problem ?
what &apos;s your problem ?
vodka tonic , hold the tonic .
you got it .
i &apos;ve been watching you all night .
oh , yeah ?
let &apos;s go .
you bastard !
what the hell ?
what &apos;s wrong with you , you crazy bitch ? get off him !
screw you , you son of a bitch !
stop it ! you &apos;re gonna kill him !
let go of me !
freak !
come on , man . take it easy . i &apos;m just a girl .
i will give you $ 10,000 for a cigarette .
you know , you really shouldn &apos;t smoke , amanda .
it &apos;s bad for the skin .
you .
what the hell do you want ?
some moo goo gai pan and maybe some wontons .
care to join ?
no .
well , i really hate to eat alone , so , uh ...
why don &apos;t you hop in ?
you should really drink some tea .
it &apos;ll help with that hangover .
i don &apos;t like to think that far ahead .
oh , well , that explains why , uh , you didn &apos;t consider
that the guy you just toilet capped at the club
could press charges .
well , let him . i can afford it .
i promised your dad that i would look after you .
you don &apos;t even know me .
i met you once six months ago .
yeah , outside the gates
of your lovely one @-@ bedroom at allenwood detention ,
where i gave you half my company .
if you came to get your money back , you &apos;re too late .
i don &apos;t want it back .
i just want you to use it for something
other than your own self @-@ destruction .
destruction &apos;s in my d.n.a.
take it up with darwin .
wait .
you didn &apos;t read the journals , did you ?
and so what if i did , he &apos;d still be dead
and i couldn &apos;t do anything about it .
this isn &apos;t about changing things , amanda .
this is about knowing who your dad really was .
you have to read those journals .
thanks for the ride .
amanda .
this is everyone ?
everyone who represents a threat of exposure .
i &apos;ve expedited their invitations to your new year &apos;s party .
you know what my resolution is gonna be this year ?
no more parties .
they &apos;re like a hidden tax on the rich .
i think victoria might have something to say about that .
about what ?
we have a situation .
so you said when you summoned me .
now what was so important
that i had to leave le bernardin mid @-@ course ?
this came in the mail yesterday .
- 大卫 · 克拉克
from david clarke ?
obviously not ,
being the man &apos;s been dead for the past eight months .
what is this , some kind of sick joke ?
we &apos;re treating it as a threat
from someone who had inside knowledge of the circumstances .
frank &apos;s compiled a list of everyone who played
a willing role in the cover @-@ up
and everyone who was complicit in their ignorance ,
and all of them will now be attending
our annual new year &apos;s party in the hamptons .
and once we have them corralled ,
frank will be using his investigative acumen
to narrow down the suspects .
well , count me out .
i find the prospect
of ringing in the new year with any of these people
absolutely nauseating .
more or less nauseating
than the prospect of life in prison ?
because that is what we face if the author of this note
decides to expose the truth about the late mr. david clarke .
what can i get ya ?
vodka tonic , hold the tonic .
want a twist ?
the hero and the villain are actually the same person .
get it ?
a twist .
sorry . i &apos;m taking a mail @-@ in creative writing course .
funny .
no , it &apos;s dumb , but anything to pass the time .
in the winters , it &apos;s like &quot; the shining &quot; around here .
actually , you &apos;re the first new face i &apos;ve seen since summer .
you a local ?
mm . no . just passing through .
jack , help your brother before he breaks something .
you &apos;re not gonna break anything , are you , dec ?
he &apos;s got it .
that the last of your stuff ?
yeah , i got one more load , and then your boyfriend
officially lives in a bar .
mm . lucky me .
hey , amanda .
ah . okay .
what do you think ?
your tie is a little crooked .
you know , i don &apos;t have to go tonight .
why not ? it sounds fun .
because ...
it &apos;s kind of a tradition ,
us staying home , watching the ball drop .
you fell asleep last year .
i think you need a new tradition .
so did not fall asleep .
yeah , you did . and i stayed awake .
no , no , you actually--
i &apos;m gonna have to torture you now ...
stop that .
because you are ...
stop .
you shall be grounded .
happy new year , all .
who &apos;s that ?
hey .
oh , hey , bill .
hey .
party &apos;s next door .
i just came to make sure you &apos;d show up
and to give a certain young lady her christmas present .
ariel . thanks , uncle bill .
hey , come on .
conrad &apos;s montecristos aren &apos;t gonna smoke themselves , huh ?
all right . don &apos;t stay up too late .
bye .
you know how much i love you ?
infinity times infinity .
that &apos;s right .
good night .
bye .
happy new year , honey .
you ready ?
yeah , i guess as i &apos;ll ever be ...
&quot; my dear amanda ,
in the pages that follow ,
i &apos;ve attempted to piece together
the ruthless betrayal that brought about
my false imprisonment and our unbearable separation .
i hope this chronicle will one day provide you
an understanding of what i believe happened to me .
if i &apos;m at all culpable for what happened to us , amanda ...
believing in a system rigged against me
by the people i knew as friends
in a life i can no longer ...
it &apos;s because i gave away my trust too easily ...
bill harmon has been a close associate
of the graysons &apos; for years , whereas conrad has ...
roger halsted is a true friend .
as for why he would let himself be dragged into this ...
i can &apos;t claim to know tom kingsly very well ,
in prosecuting the case against me ,
it &apos;s clear that he buried evidence
on behalf of the graysons . &quot;
hello . happy new year .
thank you , sir .
lydia .
oh , michael .
it is so good to see you both .
we wouldn &apos;t have come by a day early like this ,
but we were kind of , uh , in the neighborhood .
house shopping .
michael promised to buy a place in southampton .
unfortunately , all the beachfront properties get snatched up
the second they hit the market .
one day , this bubble is gonna burst .
oh , well , let it .
there &apos;s been a veritable invasion of riffraff around here
ever since the feds flattened the rates .
what he means
is that we &apos;d be thrilled to have you as neighbors .
the closer the better .
be careful what you wish for .
we did put an offer on
david clarke &apos;s old beach house next door .
yes , but , uh ,
after the government seized the property ,
they auctioned it off to some dummy corporation .
i mean , you &apos;d think with the history of that house ,
they would be happy to unload it .
but apparently , they &apos;re not entertaining any offers .
no .
oh , well , that &apos;s unfortunate .
would you please take the davises bags
and situate them in an oceanfront room ?
hey , hold the tonic .
thought you were just passing through .
thought i &apos;d stay a little longer than expected .
how are the burgers here ?
can &apos;t say . i don &apos;t eat meat .
people who do say they &apos;re the best in montauk .
hey , boss , um ...
you think i can get tomorrow night off ?
i lined up a gig with a catering service
for the graysons &apos; new year &apos;s thing .
i need you here .
well , i figured that with the way
that business has been going , you ...
were gonna start cutting shifts .
you want the catering job , take it .
but just don &apos;t come back here .
turned you down ?
i &apos;m gonna go broke if i keep working at this place ,
and we need cash if we &apos;re going to europe this summer .
i &apos;m sorry , ky .
it &apos;s not like this is some small setback .
dad had to sell the house .
i &apos;m not mad at him . i &apos;m mad at montauk .
i feel like i &apos;m gonna be stuck here my whole life .
there are worse places .
sorry .
drama .
you know , i could use some extra cash , too .
think i could fill in for you at that new year &apos;s party ?
kick you back 25 % if you can hook it up .
sure , if you really want to work on new year &apos;s eve .
what &apos;s your name ?
mandy .
sammy .
you got so big .
your dad always said you had a soft spot for animals .
what , are you following me now ?
in this weather , more like tracking .
don &apos;t you have any friends or family of your own
to harass over the holidays ?
sammy .
come on . get in here .
hey , listen , if you guys aren &apos;t doing anything
tomorrow for new year &apos;s ,
we got 2 @-@ for @-@ 1 shots here till midnight .
tell your friends .
what do you think ?
i made plans .
let me guess .
volunteering in a homeless shelter .
finding out who my father was .
now get lost , nolan .
i haven &apos;t had a guardian in ten years .
i don &apos;t need one now .
i see michael and lydia davis have arrived .
yeah . i &apos;m pretty sure there &apos;s nothing
to worry about with them .
i mean , michael didn &apos;t even play a part ,
and lydia &apos;s not exactly the type to suffer
a crisis of conscience .
i would like to think my secretary &apos;s a tad more loyal
than she was to david .
everyone &apos;s a suspect ,
even you .
and victoria ?
where is victoria ?
don &apos;t be afraid . they put out a nice spread .
bill .
fashionably late as usual .
oh , that &apos;s , uh , my fault , i &apos;m afraid .
bill took a detour to my house .
hi , i &apos;m david clarke .
i- i work with your husband .
happy new year , mr. clarke .
how is it we haven &apos;t met before ?
david &apos;s not much for parties .
perhaps if you acquired shares in that mentality ,
your star would be rising as fast as david &apos;s .
all work and no play , where &apos;s the fun in that ?
if you &apos;ll excuse me , i &apos;m gonna get a drink .
david just moved into the beach house next door .
oh , so you &apos;re the one .
well , welcome to the neighborhood .
it &apos;s a beautiful property .
well , it will be eventually . it needs work .
but , uh , i &apos;m afraid , uh , all i could afford was a fixer .
but it felt right .
felt ?
how refreshing .
as i understand it , we only buy properties
if the tax incentives work for us .
you know what ? uh , rudy just walked in .
let &apos;s go talk to him before he gets drunk
and starts angling for another mayoral run .
well , enjoy yourself tonight .
thank you .
victoria .
what are you doing ?
seeking calm before the storm of our guests .
in this godforsaken place ?
it was on the floor . someone &apos;s been in here .
clearly , yeah .
you know , i think it &apos;s high time we let this place go .
i &apos;m selling it .
why do we have to do that ?
because you &apos;re still in love with him .
here i was , planning a lonely new year &apos;s in the keys
when imagine my surprise ,
a last @-@ minute invitation to the ball .
well , we &apos;re just so happy you could come celebrate with us .
aww . i &apos;m happy , too , though i would be happier
if my room had an ashtray .
i thought you were going to be staying at your cottage .
i would had i ever thought to have it winterized .
ah , well , young lady .
young lady .
could you please see to it that mr. treadwell has an astray ?
and find him a place to smoke outside .
leo treadwell ?
how &apos;d you like to help me rescue your father ?
i don &apos;t think he did it .
a fan , i assume ?
your biggest .
so how have you been , victoria ?
i imagine that david clarke &apos;s death this year
came as quite a shock .
though on the plus side ,
for me , his demise
has rekindled the public &apos;s appetite for his story .
don &apos;t tell me you &apos;re writing another book .
already hard at work digging up new material .
a trip to the prison proved fruitful .
during my visits with david , i remembered
that one of his guards fancied himself a photographer .
he took this on the day that david was killed .
keep it .
we both know that he &apos;d have wanted you to have it .
最卑鄙的背叛者 有赌瘾
grayson security seized my database this morning .
the s.e.c. gets ahold of this ,
you &apos;re going to jail , bill .
grayson wants to cut a deal .
today i am just grateful
与之串谋 是指控我的检控官
that justice prevailed
and that this terrible man
has been held accountable for his crimes against the american people .
miss ?
i &apos;d rather not be seated so close to them .
them ?
all of these people .
stick me in a corner somewhere , huh ,
where no one will notice me ?
you got it .
thanks .
they got me staying in the pool house .
bring by a bottle of bourbon , huh ?
i &apos;m eternally in your debt .
被迫保持保持缄默 有机会定会帮我
what did he say to you ?
he just wanted to switch tables .
have a seat anywhere .
i @-@ i &apos;m looking for a girl .
wish i could say you came to the right place ,
but it should pick up later tonight , though .
but ... who &apos;s picking you up
later tonight , though ?
look , you have every right
to come in here and hit on the cute bartender all night .
you should just know , it &apos;s not gonna happen .
why not ?
she &apos;s with me .
ahh . sorry .
um , it &apos;s--i &apos;m nolan , by the way .
okay . i &apos;m jack .
jack ?
hello , mr. halsted ?
i had to swipe this from mr. grayson &apos;s private stash .
that man has swiped plenty more
than a bottle of whiskey over the years .
his portfolio can handle it .
i don &apos;t want your money .
i want to know about my father .
who &apos;s your father ?
david clarke .
amanda ?
what are you doing here ?
after my father died , he left me his journals .
he claims he &apos;s innocent .
he was found guilty in court .
but he said that you knew the truth , that he was set up .
and if i told you he was right ,
what would you do with that information ?
i would make sure that everybody knew about it ,
that these people got what they deserved .
i have the guest list .
according to his journals ,
most of those people are here tonight .
all the more reason for you to drop it .
is that what you did ?
you just dropped it , drank until it all went away ?
i &apos;m not afraid of these people .
and you shouldn &apos;t be either .
i have nothing more to say to you .
man , these people can drink .
yeah ? come work puff daddy &apos;s white party in september .
they go through $ 1,000 bottles like it &apos;s water .
come on , kingsly .
i &apos;m sorry , bill , but my district has spoken .
they don &apos;t want gambling near the churches or the schools .
one indian casino is
not gonna get you unelected , senator .
surely you can set aside
your family @-@ values agenda just this once .
we all know you &apos;re capable of it .
bill , could i have a word ?
do i have a choice ?
hello , dr. banks .
i read your profile in &quot; the new yorker &quot;
a couple of days ago , about the d.c. sniper .
you want to know what i think ?
no , but don &apos;t let that stop you .
mm . my savior .
let &apos;s , uh , let &apos;s talk , uh , about your new book
on attachment parenting instead . i just read it .
really ?
no . not really .
well , another year goes by .
they just go quicker and quicker .
mm . not this one .
i for one cannot wait to put this one behind me .
champagne ?
i think i might be needing something with a little more purpose .
excuse me , lydia . thank you .
what are you coveting , sweetie ?
is it the dolce
or what &apos;s underneath it ?
uh , hello again .
i was looking for your husband .
i didn &apos;t want to leave without saying thank you .
i haven &apos;t seen him .
won &apos;t you come in ?
okay . well , i guess i will , uh ...
say thank you to you .
that was a lovely evening .
well , it &apos;s snowing outside .
could i offer you some insulation from the cold ?
thank you , but i was hoping to get home
in time to watch the ball drop with my daughter .
ah , well , that &apos;s very important .
i wish i could spend new year &apos;s eve with my son ,
but he &apos;s with my in @-@ laws , and ...
i &apos;ve already called him four times .
it &apos;s amazing how much you miss them , isn &apos;t it ?
why don &apos;t you come over for brunch tomorrow ?
i &apos;d love to meet the whole family .
ah , well , it &apos;s , um , just me and amanda now .
my wife is not with us anymore .
i &apos;m so sorry .
no one should ever have to spend the holidays grieving .
thank you .
here &apos;s to my pop ,
the hardest working man in suffolk county .
what &apos;s , uh , what &apos;s up with your dad ?
did he die ?
what ? no , he &apos;s upstairs .
he &apos;s working .
hence the toast ...
my family now lives and works under the same roof .
oh , cozy .
we actually used to have
this really great cottage in amagansett .
but then this ...
rich parasite started buying up
all our neighbors one by one .
last month , my dad finally caved .
that &apos;s four family homes on seacliff lane ,
just wiped off the map .
seacliff lane , huh ?
uh , i &apos;m gonna hit the head .
so i &apos;ve talked to ... kingsly ...
harmon , and judge barnes .
i &apos;m satisfied they have nothing to do with the letter .
i see you &apos;ve crossed off dr. banks .
she &apos;s a latecomer .
she &apos;s an opportunist .
i think the guy that we &apos;re looking for
was involved from the start .
roger halsted ?
he was pretty tight with david clarke , wasn &apos;t he ?
he rolled over on him .
i always thought roger was weak .
i wouldn &apos;t say an anonymous threat
is a sign of towering strength .
oh , sorry . i didn &apos;t know anyone was in here .
i need to freshen up .
your room is actually in the south wing , mrs. davis .
i can take you there if you &apos;d like .
oh , that &apos;s-- that &apos;s all right , frank .
uh , you &apos;ve got better things to do .
i just left victoria .
she &apos;s in quite a state .
yeah .
a state of suspended animation .
so listen , uh , the corporation that owns the deed
to david clarke &apos;s house has exactly two members ,
and you &apos;re lookin &apos; at one of them .
you and victoria .
yeah .
i should &apos;ve bulldozed it when i had the chance .
that house is her twisted way of hanging on to him .
it &apos;s perverse , don &apos;t you think ,
destroy a man you love
and then weep for him eternally ?
i &apos;d be lying if i said i didn &apos;t understand
at least part of her motivation .
when you asked me to back your testimony
in david &apos;s trial ,
there &apos;s a reason i went along .
yeah , there were a million reasons
if i remember correctly .
i never gave a damn about the money .
i did it to protect you .
why ?
isn &apos;t it obvious ?
i &apos;m sorry .
anyone making any interesting resolutions this year ?
i don &apos;t believe in making promises i never intend to keep .
my resolution is to spend more time on the campaign trail
telling people what they want to hear .
not all of the people .
who invented this idiotic tradition anyways ?
it &apos;s pagan from pre @-@ christian rome .
january is of course named for janus ,
the patron and protector of endings and beginnings ,
a god with two faces .
isn &apos;t that appropriate ?
one face looking forward , one looking back .
of course , we don &apos;t much like looking in that direction , do we ?
better to forget the innocent people
we &apos;ve had to destroy in order to ...
ensure our own survival .
oh , roger brought the drunkard out early this year .
how droll .
oh , there you are . miss .
oh , i got you .
i &apos;ll help you . i promise .
all right . i &apos;m all right .
i &apos;m all right . oh , frank .
be a good dog and fetch me a refill , will you ?
i think you &apos;ve had enough .
it looks like our bartenders
have been a little heavy handed tonight .
come on . let &apos;s have a talk .
hey , let go of me !
mr. porter ?
yeah .
i &apos;m nolan ross .
i &apos;m the guy who bought your house
and all the houses around your house .
oh , congratulations .
well , when i asked my business manager
to look for property ...
i didn &apos;t realize he &apos;d be displacing so many families .
yeah , well , that &apos;s life .
uh , what i &apos;m trying to say is ,
it &apos;s not too late for me to pull out of escrow .
well , nobody &apos;s asking you to do that .
it &apos;s not a problem .
well , not for you , maybe .
but see , i can &apos;t afford to keep that place .
i mean , look , my wife walked out
on me and my boys years ago .
she shows up last month asking for a divorce
and half of everything i own .
not even a mention of a hello to her own children .
i &apos;m sorry .
so it &apos;s either the house or the bar .
now if--if you pull out of the deal ,
i &apos;m gonna have to come clean with my boys
and tell &apos; em that their own mother
don &apos;t give one damn about them .
you get what i &apos;m saying ?
yeah .
i do .
roger , roger , roger .
you were in rare form tonight .
i get anxious at social functions .
social anxiety ...
is that why you requested
a seat away from the graysons &apos; table ?
no one should be forced to suffer my company .
i &apos;m surprised i was even invited .
must have been an oversight .
oh , no .
we wanted you here .
you know , the graysons received
a disturbing note .
what &apos;d you hope to gain by sending this ?
why would i send this ?
because you feel guilty
and you &apos;re too scared to do anything about it ,
because the note &apos;s a way to project blame ,
make yourself feel less culpable
for what happened to david clarke .
i just brought mr. halsted some aspirin .
you know what ? i @-@ i have something stronger .
he &apos;ll sleep like a baby .
it &apos;s almost midnight . you should probably get out there
and get the champagne ready .
yes , sir .
before we close the book on 2002,
i &apos;d like to raise a glass
to all of you who have stood by our family
here at home and at grayson global .
as many of you know ,
our company has been languishing in the red
ever since the , um , the terrible incident back in &apos; 93 .
but i am proud to announce
that after ten long years ,
we &apos;ve finally fought our way back to black .
grayson global is on top again ,
and that is where i intend to keep us .
hear , hear .
and continuing with the theme of onward and upward ,
it gives me great pleasure to announce that
michael and lydia davis will be sharing
our little stretch of beach .
as i &apos;ve managed
to broker a deal with the title holders
of the house right next door ,
who at long last will be relinquishing their
death grip on the property .
you &apos;re a mensch , conrad .
we &apos;ll have to arrange a finder &apos;s fee .
having you as my neighbors is payment enough . thank you .
to a prosperous 2003 .
15 seconds to midnight , everyone .
15 ...
14 , 13 ...
12 , 11 , 10 ...
almost midnight . it &apos;s bad luck if i don &apos;t kiss somebody .
oh , you--you better find your boyfriend .
jack and i don &apos;t want the same things anymore .
oh , you know , i don &apos;t want to get in the middle of all that .
too late .
what the hell , man ? !
it &apos;s not my fault .
jack !
could i have a sit ?
of course , neighbor .
about that ...
i have a confession to make .
conrad was able to broker the deal
with that owner for you ...
because we are the owners .
i lied to you , and i &apos;m sorry .
it has nothing to do
with how i feel about you as a friend
or our friendship .
it was a place that i held for reasons of my own .
and i can &apos;t really make you understand it , but ...
that house was , um ...
the only thing of david i had left .
it &apos;s not hard to understand at all .
take the house , lydia .
make it your own .
nothing would make me happier than
to have my closest friend be my closest neighbor .
oh , there you are . miss .
oh , i got you .
i &apos;ll help you . i promise .
roger ?
roger , it &apos;s amanda .
it appears we can close the case
of the mystery holiday card .
for a man with a penchant for writing letters ,
you would think that roger would have left a suicide note .
suicide is not a rational act .
i did a comprehensive sweep of the room .
he left nothing behind .
oh , how convenient for all of us .
quite the soiree .
it feels like we &apos;ve been cast in &quot; ten little indians . &quot;
i wonder who &apos;ll be the last to fall .
i suppose you consider it your job
to break this torrid story .
less a job than a moral obligation .
to quote lippmann ,
&quot; there can be no higher law in journalism
than to tell the truth and to shame the devil . &quot;
shame the devil ?
you wrote that note .
i &apos;m a writer .
though this gruesome turn of events
was certainly not the intention .
then what on earth did you plan on gaining from it ?
inspiration .
i thought i &apos;d beat the bushes to see if i could drum up
some kind of fresh intrigue for my book .
you are despicable .
gee , thanks .
high praise coming from you .
they framed my father .
you were right .
you got what you wanted .
it &apos;s what he wanted .
i met a friend of his tonight .
he knew everything , and he was gonna help me .
and now he &apos;s dead , too .
what ?
and unless somebody does something about it ,
they will never get what they deserve .
amanda ...
more than knowing the truth ,
your father wanted you to get past all this .
then why did he give me those journals ? !
one way or another , these people are gonna pay .
they &apos;re gonna pay for what they did .
you cannot bring the graysons down all by yourself .
you will never get close enough to expose them .
the hell i won &apos;t !
aman--
dad , i &apos;m sorry .
help me .
&quot; amanda ,
forgive me my methods , but i had to get you this message
before i lost my nerve . &quot;
&quot; writing this down is my way of committing to you . &quot;
&quot; i &apos;ll tell you everything--
how your father was framed , who was involved ,
and most importantly , how to expose them . &quot;
&quot; i &apos;ve never had the courage to do it myself ,
but i believe you do . &quot;
&quot; once we &apos;re on neutral ground ,
i &apos;ll help you . &quot;
&quot; until then , get as far away from these people as you can . &quot;
i &apos;m home .
hey , babe , you &apos;re late .
i &apos;m sorry . traffic was terrible .
wow . you look stunning .
look at you .
you better hurry up and change .
wouldn &apos;t be right for the new face of grayson global
to keep them waiting on new year &apos;s eve .
right , about that ,
what do you say we duck out early
and do some celebrating of our own tonight ?
i can &apos;t imagine you &apos;d rather do anything less
than make small talk with my parents &apos; friends
on new year &apos;s eve .
