morning , sunshines .
coffee ?
what do we got ? we got any headlines ?
not much . although they keep bitching about this bible ...
could be a debt ledger .
oh , whatever it is , it &apos;s missing and they ain &apos;t happy about it .
hey guys , we have a situation .
is that barelli ?
what &apos;s he doing down here ?
oh no . it can &apos;t be good .
it &apos;s pauli nazio , isn &apos;t it ? turn on the micro .
&quot; - ... not sure about this .
do it . &quot;
damn ,
he &apos;s walking over here .
you guys are the fbi , right ?
we need your help .
last week , somebody walks into my church ,
steals the bible .
bible ? an actual bible ?
yeah , you know , the flood ,
abraham sacrifices isaac ... you heard of it ?
why do you want our help ?
i &apos;m an tax @-@ paying citizen .
so ?
file a police report .
come on , burke , you &apos;ve got your guys sitting on me .
it &apos;s part of the game , i know ,
but means i am not free to find out who did this .
yeah , it means you &apos;re not free to bust heads until you do .
do i have to take these accusations ?
get to your point .
this bible ,
it &apos;s not just some book that the gidions leave on the nightstand .
this is five centuries of history from naples .
the saints prayed over this book .
your personal feelings for barelli aside ,
i don &apos;t want the archdiocese &apos;s crawling on our necks
because we refused to help recover a medieval bible .
fine .
but if barelli asked for our help ...
he must really want it back .
all right , let &apos;s get this straight here .
you may go to confession once a week ,
but the bureau doesn &apos;t forgive sins .
we don &apos;t work for you .
what do you want ?
shut down your book @-@ making operations at masso &apos;s club .
masso &apos;s . it &apos;s a restaurant .
see it for yourself , any time ...
after thursday .
please help me find my god damn bible ..
please stop .
it &apos;s part of my process .
look , either you taught her too well , or it &apos;s just a bottle .
that &apos;s more than that .
this is the only thing kate left me .
it &apos;s a message here .
hello ?
yeah , peter . i &apos;ll be down in 5 .
oh , okay , i &apos;m coming right now .
oh , the man interferes yet again .
can you please ...
yes , i &apos;ll take it back to the lab ,
run some tests .
you don &apos;t have a lab . you have a storage unit .
semantics .
thanks , moz .
the bible belonged to
the church of saint camillus de lellis in naples .
it was brought here in 1903 .
it &apos;s been the heart of our parish .
now this .
no alarm , no witnesses ...
no sign of a forced entry .
it looks like a smash @-@ and @-@ dash .
anything unusual that night , father ?
no , not that i recall .
have e.r.t. run the prints against the parish roster .
something tells me we &apos;ll get a few matches .
nobody from this parish stole that bible .
oh , sure .
you guys are all choirboys , right , barelli ?
no surveillance cameras .
the lord sees all ,
and that &apos;s good enough for us .
maybe i &apos;m getting my st.whatevers mixed up ,
but didn &apos;t you used to run a soup kitchen here ?
not anymore .
who steals a bible ?
people steal everything .
why would we steal one ?
just in theory . uh , they &apos;re rare .
yeah , it makes them valuable , but not like a picasso .
it &apos;s definitely niche markets .
tough to fence .
people get weird about buying stolen religious artifacts .
i think it &apos;s an irony thing , that pesky eighth commandment .
yeah , &quot; thou shalt not steal . &quot;
well , it depends what &apos;s important to people .
did you know that
an original &quot; star trek &quot; dome lunchbox goes for 600 bucks ?
i don &apos;t try to explain it
no , i @-@ i can appreciate that , but why this one ?
well , your missing book is famous . it &apos;s known as the healing bible .
really ? attribution .
in 1588 , the plague passed through naples .
father camillus carried the book into
disease @-@ stricken ships in the harbor .
not a single person who touched the bible died .
good story .
20 years later ,
a blind girl regained her sight when she rescued the book from a fire .
i could give you many more examples .
no , i @-@ i &apos;m sure you could .
look , maybe you don &apos;t steal it for the money .
maybe you steal because you &apos;re a true believer .
true believer ?
you got something better ?
every person in that church has a felony record .
the only people i don &apos;t suspect are the ones in prison .
so , let &apos;s start with the faithful .
&quot; it cures blind nuns and lepers . &quot;
sounds like every story in sunday school .
okay.look at this .
in 1918 , 30,000 people in new york died from the spanish flu .
no one in this parish even caught a cold .
maybe whoever took it thinks it &apos;s gonna heal them .
it &apos;s worth looking into .
nobody in this church got the flu ?
it &apos;s true .
why these guys and not the church down the block ?
because of a book ?
tough to swallow .
i thought you were catholic .
lapsed .
so you don &apos;t think some higher power
could have saved the congregation ?
oh , i &apos;m more inclined to think they kept the doors shut
and loaded up on vitamin c.
maybe god works with what he &apos;s got .
and god said , &quot; shut thine doors and eat thine oranges &quot; ?
why not ?
all right , look .
when they dug up king tut ,
everybody made such a big deal out of the curse of the pharaoh .
yeah , two dozen people who entered the tomb ended up dead .
yeah , they probably caught some old bacterial infection .
germs -- there &apos;s your divine intervention .
god can &apos;t use bacteria ?
i prefer my miracles with a little more smiting and lightning .
can i help you ?
thanks for seeing us again , father .
we wanted to run down one thing .
you didn &apos;t tell us your bible was also known as a healing bible .
i didn &apos;t think it was relevant .
could be .
was there anybody in your church
who is a true believer of the healing power of the bible ?
someone who was terminally ill ?
someone who had sick family member ?
i was afraid this might happen .
what ?
mr. barelli has discouraged the homeless from the church .
he made you shut down the soup kitchen .
how christian of him .
the night of the theft ,
i let a homeless man sleep in the sanctuary .
his name &apos;s steve .
is he sick ?
no . but someone every close to him is .
steve ?
uh , my name is peter .
this is my friend neal .
you mind if we ask you some questions ?
the church you stayed in last week --
they &apos;re missing a bible .
you know anything about it ?
yeah , i @-@ i took it .
great .
we need it back .
no . no , i need it back .
what do you mean ? where is it ?
i took it from the church like he asked me to .
now , he said that he would show me how to help lucy get better .
then he took it from me .
now , he has not brought it back .
do you know where he is ?
no . i wish i did .
who asked you to take the bible from the church ?
look , he said that he would help lucy get better .
she &apos;s not getting better , okay ? she &apos;s getting worse .
what &apos;s wrong with her ?
she &apos;s tired all the time .
s @-@ she don &apos;t eat nothing .
now , if i could get that bible back , she &apos;ll get better .
the man who asked you to take the bible--
did you meet him at the church ?
yeah .
steve , if we showed you some pictures ,
do you think you could recognize him ?
we just need to get the bible back , okay ?
&apos;cause she &apos;s fading , all right ?
you okay to keep going ?
what ?
there &apos;s more of them ?
yeah . let &apos;s , uh , just get through this one , okay ?
glad we followed your hunch . i hope it takes us somewhere .
oh yeah , a little faith .
been waiting all day to trot that one out , huh ?
been holding onto it since lunch .
um , i &apos;m gonna be right back , okay ?
that bad , huh ?
yeah , &quot; that bad &quot; was about an hour ago .
just give me the damn thing .
no luck , huh ?
no , not --not really , no .
look , um ... i &apos;m sorry i &apos;m not more help to you .
my bell got rung pretty good in fallujah .
you were in iraq ?
yeah .
t @-@ that &apos;s wherei found lucy .
we called in this predator strike on this trigger house .
two hellfires came in ... and just destroyed everything .
then i hear this little whimpering , so ...
i lift up this piece of roof ,
and there she was , just wagging her tail .
well , you think you could look at one more book ?
yeah .
okay , the rest of you go over there ,
make sure nypd doesn &apos;t touch anything .
what &apos;s going on ?
one of barelli &apos;s men just got shot .
who ?
paul ignazio , barelli &apos;s number two .
barelli &apos;s nephew .
that &apos;s him .
who ?
that &apos;s the guy that asked meto take the bible .
that &apos;s our boy .
close range .
no eyewitnesses .
body &apos;s not water logged , so it &apos;s ...
fresh .
25 @-@ caliber casing . european gauge .
it &apos;s a 22 @-@ caliber .
this is brooklyn , buddy , not bavaria .
pete burke .
this is a homicide , not an art exhibit . what are you doing here ?
ruiz , i see they let you out of your cubicle .
yeah . this is my shore now .
where &apos;s your pet convict ?
i left him in the car with the windows cracked .
what are you doing at my crime scene ?
this tails into my case .
this is mob retaliation .
it &apos;s my investigation now .
you don &apos;t believe me , ask hughes .
don &apos;t --don &apos;t start with me .
you &apos;ve got ruiz running organized crime ?
that &apos;s unbelievable .
we offer you that bump every year . every year , you turn it down .
this isn &apos;t mob @-@ on @-@ mob .
the bible &apos;s the key to this thing .
all you got is a homeless guy with a spotty memory
who thinks ignazio may have enticed him into stealing the bible .
what we got here is a deadmember of the barelli family
probably killed by the morettis .
all right , fine .
i &apos;ll stay out of the active investigation .
just let me take a look at whatever &apos;s on that body .
it &apos;s ruiz &apos;s case , and he &apos;s not comfortable sharing intel
while caffrey &apos;s with you .
oh , come on .
he &apos;s a convicted felon , peter .
and ruiz isn &apos;t the only one with reservations .
all right ,
well ... plenty of other cases on your sheet .
let organized crime handle this one .
we &apos;re off the case .
we &apos;ve been asked to step down .
you think this is a retaliation killing by the other family ?
i don &apos;t think paul
would have met a moretti alone by this river ,
not with all the bad blood in the water .
now , if ruiz is right ...
that a moretti killed him ?
we may be sitting on the edge of a mob war .
so , what do we do ?
i can &apos;t do much of anything .
ruiz is not willing to share the case file .
so , where &apos;s that leave us ?
like i said , i can &apos;t do much of anything .
i &apos;m getting a little chilly by this water , aren &apos;t you ?
think i could borrow your jacket ?
i swear to you , peter ,
under no circumstances will i impersonate the fbi .
where do you think you &apos;re going ?
this is paul ignazio &apos;s apartment , right ?
hi , uh , ted jefferson from the evidence recovery team .
i don &apos;t care if you &apos;re thomas jefferson .
i need i.d.
oh , sorry .
i pulled a double @-@ hommy last night .
it &apos;s in the van .
my partner took it to see his girlfriend in queens .
not my problem , brother .
look , i just need a urine swab from the vic &apos;s toilet .
if i don &apos;t get it soon , it &apos;ll spike the cross @-@ reactivity , and then --
i got orders , too , pal . no i.d. , no pee .
oh , i know . you can get it .
it &apos;s easy .
all you got to do is swab around the rim of the toilet ,
then drop the swab into the tube ,
screw the cap on the tube , and , bam , we &apos;re good to go .
no way . i &apos;m not doing that .
okay . now it &apos;s your problem .
yeah , cap . i got a local hero by the name of ...
okay , okay , pee boy .
get it yourself .
oh , it turns out the hero &apos;s on our side .
never mind .
any problems getting in ?
none . he thinks i &apos;m swabbing toilets .
i figure we &apos;ve got about 10 minutes until he gets curious .
why , is that the standard toilet @-@ swabbing time ?
yes , that &apos;s exactly what it is .
you know , you look pretty comfortable in that fbi windbreaker .
maybe it &apos;s time to consider a new career path .
nope.i prefer to keep my soul .
what are we looking for ?
paul convinced our homeless guy to steal a bible .
i want to know why , i want to know who killed him ,
and i want to know if they &apos;re related .
he was researching something .
hundred years &apos; war , the crusades .
illuminated manuscripts .
why is a mob guy researching many of a history ?
do you know the name maria fiametta ?
doesn &apos;t ring a bell . who is she ?
art historian , brooklyn state .
serendipity -- paul had an appointment at brooklyn state .
you find anything ?
your hunch was right . ruiz is on the wrong trail .
and how did you learn this ?
a friend . - the same friend who --
same guy .
he &apos;s real . i &apos;m not making him up .
oh , i know he &apos;s real .
how much do you know ?
enough . what &apos;d you find ?
a professor who writes about the black market --
sicilian grave robbers , egyptian smugglers , and serbian mobsters .
i mean , you can &apos;t run with those crowds unless you &apos;re willing to get dirt under your nails .
what &apos;s his name ?
her name is maria fiametta .
a woman .
a regular &quot; cindiana &quot; jones .
do you want to go meet her ?
yeah , i think i do .
you gentlemen are with the fbi ?
yes , we &apos;re hoping you can help us out on this one .
we &apos;re working on a stolen bible .
show her .
thank you , agent ... ?
neal caffrey .
that &apos;s funny . there &apos;s a very talented manuscript forger
also named neal caffrey .
how talented ?
you &apos;re him .
and you &apos;re with the fbi ?
it &apos;s ... sort of a work release .
i have to ask -- um , is it true that the vinland map is yours ?
how could it be ?
but if it is a forgery , it &apos;s spectacular .
how about we get back to my current problem ?
a pre @-@ renaissance bible stolen
from a church in brooklyn .
it &apos;s ... very beautiful , but it &apos;s not a bible .
it &apos;s not ?
pre @-@ renaissance , yes , uh ,
but it &apos;s too small to be a bible .
then it &apos;s a book of hours .
most likely , yes . in the italian style .
it &apos;s a large prayer book .
to show their devotion , monks and nuns
had to recite the psalms , hymns , or chants at specific times all day long .
sunday school .
lots of sundays .
this is a particularly nice example .
paul ignazio thought so , too .
sorry ?
do you know him ?
no .
we believe he stole it .
oh , well , i hope you catch him .
can &apos;t -- he &apos;s dead .
looks like a mob hit ,
but we &apos;re still hoping to figure out who took the book .
i &apos;d love to know . it &apos;s quite beautiful .
here &apos;s my card . if you hear anything or come across anyone
who &apos;s looking to buy or sell something like that ...
i will call you .
thank you
it &apos;s a pleasure .
if you are ever in the mood to discuss medieval manuscripts --
oh , you &apos;d be surprised how often i &apos;m in the mood for that .
was this just an exercise in schadenfreude ?
because you win . it &apos;s just a bottle , man .
the lab needs to re @-@ examineits work .
the lab went over every inch of that thing .
finger prints , chemicals , black light -- nothing .
i even tested the remnants of the wine left in the bottle ,
which , by the way , was a very lovely boxed
franzia from early october .
oh , your fbi friend keeps you on a tight leash .
all right , look , keep looking , moz . something &apos;s there , okay ?
she &apos;s lying about paul ,
and she &apos;s two degrees away from our homeless guy ,
but i also have trouble buying the fact
that an attractive history professor offed a mobster .
no , you don &apos;t want me to see the missing inventory
because if i come down there ,
there &apos;s gonna be a lot more missing than centerpieces .
you got that ?
okay , maybe it &apos;s not a complete stretch .
hey , guys .
sorry . um , it was just my vendor .
no , it &apos;s fine .
we were just trying to decide if a woman is capable of murder .
oh , i think so .
what &apos;s the issue ?
i @-@ i think we &apos;re dealing with a shell game .
visual aids . nice .
big gulp is paul , dead mob guy .
coffee cup is steve , our homeless vet .
mug is maria .
napkin &apos;s the bible .
make maria the saltshaker .
maria &apos;s the mug . watch .
we &apos;ll start with paul ,
who , for some reason , reads maria &apos;s book
and realizes that the healing bible is worth a hell of a lot of cash .
but it &apos;s also barelli &apos;s pride and joy .
he doesn &apos;t want to risk barelli &apos;s wrath ,
so he gets ... steve to steal the bible .
plausible deniability .
but if it doesn &apos;t work ,
then he let &apos;s the homeless guy take the fall .
well , that &apos;s evil .
takes the bible from steve ,
calls maria to make the deal . something happens .
yeah , the deal goes down wrong ,
or paul decides he wants both the cash and the book .
well , whatever it is , paul ends up dead ,
the bible goes missing , steve never even met maria .
and our girl walks away clean with a very expensive book .
okay , how &apos;d you do that ?
never reveal your secrets .
well , how do we get maria to reveal hers ?
well , if i stretch it , i might be able to
get a warrant to get into her place .
you know , if she &apos;s smart .
she &apos;s not gonna have that bible anywhere close to her .
el , i &apos;ve never seen this devious side .
don &apos;t cross me .
elizabeth &apos;s right about the bible .
she won &apos;t keep it close .
i &apos;ve got it . she knew who you were
neal caffrey , master forger .
alleged .
alleged . whatever .
if she &apos;s got the book ,
it links her to the murder .
she &apos;s gonna want to get rid of it .
we &apos;ve got all the usual channels locked down ,
but if she thinks you might be interested ...
convince her i &apos;m pliable .
we find some street contacts ,
float it out that old neal caffrey is back in business .
no , that could take time to reach her ,
and there &apos;s no guarantee .
why don &apos;t you just ask her out ?
that could work . think she &apos;ll say yes ?
yes .
i could prob--
to history , old and new .
how does an fbi agent get a table here ?
it &apos;s like a six @-@ month wait .
oh , an fbi agent doesn &apos;t .
don &apos;t forget --i had a previous life .
oh , yeah .
do you believe in reincarnation ?
you could say that .
how about you ?
who were you in your previous life ?
same person i &apos;ve always
been ... with &apos; 90s hair .
i doubt that .
let me see your lifeline .
no .
come on , it &apos;ll -- it &apos;ll help fill in the blanks .
you &apos;re not seriously gonna read my palm right now , are you ?
calluses .
not afraid to get dirty .
well , that &apos;s true .
what else ?
no ring . between that and the calluses ,
i &apos;m guessing work gets in the way .
not a ring for you , either .
yeah . prison got in the way .
so , it must be weird for you --working for the fbi .
i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s always interesting to read from the other team &apos;s playbook .
the other team ? i thought you were out of the game .
oh , i am .
retired and rehabilitated .
have you found your missing bible ?
not yet .
you know anyone who wants to buy one ?
maybe .
looters approach me all the time . so do buyers .
it &apos;s a very attractive offer .
it sure is .
uh , judge rattigan faxed the warrant .
excellent .
all right , neal &apos;s got orders to keep her away from her home for at least an hour .
can you bypass the alarm ?
two minutes .
let &apos;s do it .
surprise me .
oh , you sure ?
i might order something you don &apos;t like ,
and then where would we be ?
i trust you .
after all , you work for the fbi .
more wine ?
now you read minds ?
the question is , do you ?
it &apos;s not bad for a college professor , huh ?
yeah , well , she &apos;s either a crook or a trust @-@ fund baby .
yeah , maybe it &apos;s both .
they usually are .
nice catch .
yeah , not a bad place to drop a bug , either .
yeah . yeah , yeah . it &apos;s good coverage . let &apos;s do it .
she &apos;s bringing him back here for dessert .
of course she is .
oh , you jealous you ain &apos;t getting any of it ?
neal ? no .
i &apos;m perfectly fine with the stale @-@ ass coffee i have in the van , thank you .
good ?
yeah , we &apos;re good .
careful , lauren . don &apos;t spill that stale @-@ ass coffee .
it &apos;s a bug . i can hear .
they &apos;re home . roll tape .
some wine ?
why not ?
so ... what shall we talk about ?
there &apos;s this story about these two spies ,
a french duke and an italian count .
they &apos;re sworn enemies who spent the whole year
trying to trick each other ,
but on new year &apos;s eve , they got to ask one question
that the other had to answer truthfully .
yes .
the trick was asking the right question
because you may never get another chance .
i &apos;ve always said honesty is a more challenging game .
&quot; honesty is a more challenging game &quot; ?
geez , how come my dates don &apos;t go like this ?
because you don &apos;t say things like ,
&quot; honesty is a more challenging game . &quot;
that &apos;s because nobody actually talks like that .
they do in neal caffrey &apos;s world .
this wine needs to breathe .
i &apos;m gonna get a decanter .
why don &apos;t you put some music on ?
what are you in the mood for ?
oh , you know ...
surprise you .
10 years painting the same bible .
it &apos;s like stalking god .
if it weren &apos;t for the monk &apos;s devotion , we would have lost
one of the most significant works of greek literature forever .
stunning .
i agree .
you know what ?
i don &apos;t trust you .
smart .
i wouldn &apos;t trust me , either .
i think we have a technical problem .
that &apos;s one way of putting it .
let &apos;s play the spies game .
i &apos;ll ask you a question ...
and i have to tell youthe truth ?
and you have to tell me the truth .
okay . make it a good one .
which neal caffrey are you ?
are you working for the good guys ...
or are you working a bigger game ?
what happened ?
neal happened .
did i answer your question ?
maybe .
the feds linked barelli &apos;s bible to paul ignazio ,
and you to paul through his visits to the college .
look , maria , i &apos;m living proof .
if the feds want something from you ,
they &apos;ll turn your life inside out to get it .
they &apos;ll tell barelli you have his book .
even if i don &apos;t ?
i can get you $ 250,000 in two days .
it is worth a lot more than that .
not if you &apos;re in prison or dead .
between the fbi and the mob , there &apos;s no way you can move it .
i can .
&quot; the other team &apos;s playbook . &quot;
if i shouldn &apos;t risk it , why are you ?
won &apos;t they send you back for good ?
i &apos;m already in prison .
we have a deal ?
how did you know she was in on it ?
lucky hunch .
ruiz ?
i checked paul &apos;s credit .
he got wired 10 g &apos;s from a shell corporation
in gibraltar owned by your lady professor .
oh , by the way , how &apos;d last night &apos;s fishing go ? get any tape ?
equipment failure . but caffrey says she has the book .
she &apos;ll sell , but only to him .
of course he &apos;d say that . the terms ?
$ 250,000 wired to a swiss account .
no way . what if he cuts a deal with her , he runs away with the book ?
what choice do we have ?
we don &apos;t .
i don &apos;t need another dead body washing up in the east river .
we &apos;ll set up a dummy account .
it &apos;s risky . what if she takes a shotat neal ?
i wouldn &apos;t lose any sleep over it .
morning , guys .
everybody sleep okay ?
cayman &apos;s first national .
i &apos;ll e @-@ mail you the pin right before the buy .
first they &apos;re sending me back to prison , tomorrow they &apos;re giving
me a quarter million taxpayer dollars in an offshore account .
guess that shows how much confidence they have in you .
and how much i have in you .
morning .
you &apos;re up early .
couldn &apos;t sleep .
big day .
i can tell .
you &apos;re wearing your lucky tie .
hey , did you find the bible ?
yeah . the professor had it .
neal &apos;s gonna buy it back .
you &apos;re giving him money .
no wonder--lucky tie .
no way . we set up a fake wire transfer .
then what are you worried about ?
he has to convince her that he &apos;s working us ,
which means he has to cut his anklet for real .
the book &apos;s worth a fortune . he could run with it .
well , you have a lot more faith
in a ratty , old tie than you do neal .
yeah , well , this ratty , old tie &apos;s never
forged a priceless map of vinland .
why is it so hard for you to believe
that he &apos;ll do the right thing ?
let &apos;s just say that &apos;s not his first instinct .
and trust isn &apos;t yours .
occupational hazard .
i like to know i can count on something .
i know you do .
but sometimes you just have to take a leap of faith .
look at him .
son of a bitch should be in leg @-@ irons if you ask me .
nobody asked you , ruiz .
he conned you , too , pete , huh ?
here she comes .
we have a chaperone .
white van over my left shoulder .
what happened to not mixing business with pleasure ?
that &apos;s for us . he &apos;s patting her down .
i need a cigarette after that pat @-@ down .
you &apos;re clean .
thank you .
your turn .
well , what is that ?
she making sure that &apos;s not a gun in his pocket ?
no bugs .
so where &apos;s my money ?
where &apos;s my book ?
you ready ?
when i cut the anklet ,
our friends in the van are gonna know i &apos;m running .
can you lose them ? &apos; cause i &apos;m not going back in .
i &apos;ve been chased by the carabinieri ,
