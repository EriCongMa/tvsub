okay , sammy , let &apos;s introduce ourselves .
earplugs , boys .
fire in the hole !
arming .
three , two , one .
device neutralized .
it &apos;s empty .
no explosive device found .
confirmed . no device .
all clear . that &apos;s an all clear .
take the reins , jimmy .
good work , sergeant .
thank you .
sorry , greg .
looks like you &apos;re a little overdressed for this dance .
hey , at least it &apos;s a nice day .
all right .
you &apos;re doing great .
keep going .
come on , keep going .
okay , i think that &apos;s enough for today .
no , no , i just need a minute .
i &apos;m good .
let &apos;s keep going .
babe , you &apos;re being stubborn .
that &apos;s crazy . no , i &apos;m good .
i &apos;m good , i &apos;m good .
i just want to get out of this place .
the doctor said that you could be discharged today , remember ?
yeah , well , what does she know ?
that &apos;s what she said yesterday .
i &apos;m sorry .
adam .
there was nothing else you could have done .
you had to give gabriel the money .
if you hadn &apos;t , we &apos;d both be dead .
but we have everybody on this now .
we &apos;re gonna find him and your money ,
and we &apos;ll get the yakuza off our backs for good .
yeah .
this is one hell of a honeymoon , huh ?
we have the rest of our lives for a honeymoon .
i &apos;m here with you .
and there &apos;s no place i &apos;d rather be .
besides , where else can a girl get a different flavor
of jell @-@ o every night with her dinner ?
lou , what do we know ?
we get an anonymous call , comes into 911 with a bomb threat .
call came from a pay phone not even two blocks from here .
guy was using one of those , uh ...
one of those voice scramblers .
yeah , yeah .
so he tells dispatch there &apos;s a bomb in a briefcase
in the lobby of the monroe building .
turns out that was just a decoy ,
&apos;cause there was a secondary device in the trunk of this car here ,
right at the edge of the frozen zone .
basically , whoever did this
was deliberately targeting first responders .
it also means that he was familiar with hpd evacuation
and frozen zone protocol .
okay , whoever did this had to have been watching
to know when to detonate the device , right ?
so we need to canvass every story
on every building that had an eye line to this scene ,
including all the rooftops .
well , the ball &apos;s already rolling on that , chief .
matter of fact , the bomb squad swept the entire perimeter
with dogs before hpd set up the command post .
it &apos;s a petroleum @-@ based ied .
dogs could have missed this easily in a car .
all right , so what ?
happy accident or well @-@ thought @-@ out plan ?
yeah , but why ?
what is this about ?
is anybody taking credit for it ?
no , not yet .
cowards .
probably just waiting to get to a safe place .
well , maybe they &apos;re not done yet .
camera two , frame it tighter .
okay , let &apos;s go , people .
last looks .
we &apos;re on in two .
you got it .
&quot; a short time ago , hpd bomb squad ... &quot;
&quot; a short time ago , hpd bomb squad ,
&quot; along with firefighters and emergency medical personnel ,
&quot; responded to the 300 block of king street
&quot; after a tip that an explosive device ...
okay , come on , let &apos;s get those graphics loaded , all right ?
&quot; had been planted inside a briefcase . &quot;
stop what you &apos;re doing !
everyone out of the station !
clear it now ! go , go , go !
arming .
fire in the hole !
on three , two , one .
let &apos;s take a look inside .
wait , wait . go left . there is something right there on the left .
what is that ?
that &apos;s jason duclair .
those are all the fires he set .
what the hell &apos;s going on ?
we locked him up .
ladybug , ladybug , fly away home .
your house is on fire , and your children all burn .
except for duclair who sits in despair ,
被判于哈拉瓦监狱服刑二十五年
weaving his laces as fast as he can .
release him from prison , or more will be damned .
except for duclair who sits in despair ,
weaving his laces as fast as he can .
release him from prison , or more will be damned .
well , i &apos;m flattered i have a fan ,
but i have no idea who that might be .
see , i think you know exactly who that is .
come on , duclair , who &apos;s the poet ?
i &apos;m not sure , but ...
maybe if i could see some crime scene photos ,
i might recognize a signature .
what do you think ?
a decoy .
hold on .
secondary device .
so he was targeting first responders ?
that &apos;s right .
it &apos;s beautiful work .
that &quot; beautiful work &quot; buried the father of two little girls .
stop .
do you have any photos of any of the victims ?
all right , listen to me .
hey , you sick son of a bitch .
what &apos;s your friend &apos;s name ?
i don &apos;t have any friends .
all right , i got duclair &apos;s prison records .
this is all the correspondence since he got there .
we &apos;re gonna need full background checks
on anybody duclair has had any contact with
since he got to halawa ,
plus any known associates on the outside ,
as far back as we can go .
wow , okay , it looks like you &apos;re gonna need ,
uh , a free consultant to help with that .
are you , uh , volunteering ?
yes , i am .
thank you very much .
that &apos;d be very helpful .
you &apos;re very welcome .
what is this ? what are we looking at ?
well , the lab &apos;s still trying to unscramble the voice on the audio ,
but apparently the poem , &quot; ladybug ladybug , &quot;
has several different versions dating all the way back to 1744 .
now , the rhyme was inspired by a technique
of smoking insects out of gardens .
in the poem , the ladybug can fly away from the smoke and fire ,
but her children burning is actually a reference to the larvae
left behind on the plant ,
still trapped in their pupal cases .
remember , trapping people inside his fires
was duclair &apos;s signature .
and weaving his laces refers to an insect that manages
to undo its pupal case and escape ,
which seems like a clear reference to duclair
escaping from prison .
we &apos;re checking libraries on the island
for books with that poem in it that may have been checked out .
we &apos;ll , uh , cross @-@ reference all those names
against duclair &apos;s associates .
well , whatever the case may be , i &apos;m thinking the identity
of the poet is probably inside this box .
thanks for the lift , jer .
no worries .
oh , and i want you to know
there are no strings attached here .
this is just a personal favor
that is in no way meant to influence any pending decision
about possible employment opportunities with five @-@ 0 .
it never crossed my mind .
well , maybe i &apos;m being a little paranoid here , but ...
these are delicate times .
decisions are being made ,
and i really want to get out of the shrimp business .
tell you the truth , i don &apos;t even like shrimp .
they &apos;re the ocean &apos;s vacuum cleaner .
and , unless they &apos;re butterflied correctly ,
you &apos;re eating their poop chute .
jerry , you know what ?
you &apos;ve been a big help to five @-@ 0 .
i &apos;m sure mcgarrett will do right by you .
fingers crossed .
sorry about the smell .
yeah , uh , i &apos;m not sure these , uh ,
garlic shrimp air fresheners are helping .
i tried to tell the boss , but ...
he thinks freebies draw customers .
and flies .
tell me about it .
it &apos;s like riding around in a shrimp burrito all day .
but it pays the bills .
sort of .
actually , not really .
anyways , i got to scoot . catch you later .
and put in a good word with the boss , if you can .
will do .
thanks again , jerry .
ready ?
yeah .
welcome home .
whoa , easy , easy .
what are you doing ?
oh , you get a pass on the honeymoon ,
but you &apos;re carrying me over the threshold this time , mr. noshimuri .
all right , then ... buckle up .
watch your feet .
i love you .
i love you , too .
what is it ?
what is it ? kono , wait , wait .
duke , it &apos;s me . i need you to run a plate .
most of this junk is from a bunch of twisted women .
they all want to marry duclair and have conjugal visits
and make little pyromaniac babies .
okay . well , is there anybody
who duclair had any regular correspondence with ?
one guy . he trades letters
with a former cellie of his from halawa .
tim richards
did a stretch for commercial arson
and has some priors with hpd for grand larceny and forgery .
and the letters that he wrote to duclair ,
they trace back ...
to a p.o. box in honolulu
rented to richards .
see , that &apos;s a little suspect .
why wouldn &apos;t he send them from his own place ?
yeah .
and what makes it even more odd
is that the letters are just small talk--
like news , weather , sports stuff .
yeah , but i guarantee you
there &apos;s a hidden message inside the text .
that &apos;s what i was thinking , but ...
actually , it &apos;s not about what &apos;s inside those envelopes ;
it &apos;s about what &apos;s on them .
now , when the lab was processing all those letters and envelopes
recovered from duclair &apos;s cell ,
one of the techs noticed that the stamp ...
on this envelope didn &apos;t quite line up with the postmark .
and when she peeled it back ...
she found this .
wila writing .
easy to conceal , hard to detect .
wila writing is how convicts secretly communicate
with each other inside and outside of jail .
yeah , but not every convict can do it .
it &apos;s kind of an art form .
maybe if you had priors for , say , forgery ,
then you &apos;d probably be good at it .
right . and the notes on the back of these stamps
read like a series of love letters .
clearly , richards idolizes duclair .
he gushes about his skills and technique as an arsonist .
he wants to carry the torch and continue his work .
&quot; carry the torch &quot; ?
richards &apos; words , not mine .
yeah , but there &apos;s nothing in here about some direct plan
to bust duclair out of jail , is there ?
right , but hold on a second--
we don &apos;t have duclair &apos;s letters
to richards going out of halawa , right ?
we only have one side of the conversation .
right . so i &apos;m guessing
that duclair was calling the shots on his own escape .
i &apos;m with him .
let &apos;s get a warrant for richards &apos; place ,
see if we can find those letters .
it &apos;s just an office , danny , it &apos;s an office .
that &apos;s ... that &apos;s like your girlfriend saying ,
&quot; it &apos;s just a toothbrush . &quot;
next thing you know , you &apos;re out closet space , okay ?
and all your stuff &apos;s been moved to the attic--
including your sports memorabilia--
and your garage is turned into an arts @-@ and @-@ crafts studio .
how did rachel ever say yes to you ?
okay , this is all i am saying , all right ?
if you encourage jerry ,
he is going to expect something .
what ? a badge .
he &apos;s not getting a badge .
he &apos;s just getting an office . he &apos;s not getting a badge .
well , an office creates expectation for a badge .
then he &apos;s gonna be disappointed .
yeah , he &apos;ll be disappointed .
he &apos;ll be disappointed for about five minutes ,
until he pouts and then you cave , because you are spineless ,
and you give him a badge .
i &apos;m not gonna cave .
speaking of caving ,
what happened ?
what , you @-@ you just bailed on the proposal ?
no , i didn &apos;t bail .
i &apos;ve been planning the op .
the op ?
i secured a ring . i reconned a location .
now i just got to execute .
wow . i mean , it just , it sounds so romantic
the way you say it , you know ?
i mean , i could see it now-- you and catherine
in matching camouflage cargo pants
on some very exotic shooting range ,
and you get down on one knee , and you say ,
&quot; babe , i want you to join my unit for a lifelong mission . &quot;
i mean , it &apos;s every girl &apos;s fairy tale .
oh , yeah , you want to hear a secret ?
yeah .
you do ?
sometimes when you speak , when your mouth opens
and you speak , all i hear is &quot; wa @-@ wa @-@ wa @-@ wa . &quot;
it &apos;s like i &apos;m in a charlie brown cartoon ,
only you &apos;re linus , with better hair .
why do i got to be linus ?
that &apos;s your take @-@ away ? really ?
that &apos;s your take @-@ away from that ?
what ?
two o &apos;clock , coming out of the strip mall .
richards &apos; p.o. said
he was delivering barbecue for a local joint .
got it .
let me see your hands . show me your hands right now !
don &apos;t do anything stupid , all right ?
get out of the car .
put your hands behind your head , interlock your fingers .
on your knees , on your knees .
what the hell ? take it easy !
hands behind your head . hands behind your head !
i didn &apos;t do anything !
why &apos;d you run ?
&apos;cause you cut me off and started chasing me , man !
is he searching my trunk ?
you can &apos;t do that , man !
okay , shut up .
all right , the car looks clean .
i &apos;ll get csu to take it to the garage
and look it over properly .
get up .
i &apos;ll make it simple for you , all right ?
we found the wila letters that you sent duclair .
now , if there &apos;s another device out there ,
you need to tell us about it right now .
i &apos;m not saying another word without a lawyer .
you want a lawyer ?
okay , well , we &apos;re executing a search warrant
on your house right now .
if we find what we &apos;re looking for ,
you &apos;re gonna need a lawyer .
look , i don &apos;t know how many more ways to say
i don &apos;t know anything about any bombs planted in my house .
okay , i don &apos;t think you understand the gravity of the situation .
two police officers are dead , okay ?
three more are in the hospital fighting for their lives .
now , there &apos;s no lawyer .
you don &apos;t get a phone call . no one &apos;s coming . all right ?
and you and me ,
we &apos;re not leaving this room until i get answers .
and this is the last time i ask you nicely .
i wrote the letters for someone else .
it &apos;s the truth .
before i got out , duclair came at me .
he heard from guys on the block
that i did wila for people inside .
he said i could make some easy money
if i met with a friend of his when i got out .
great . what &apos;s duclair &apos;s friend &apos;s name ?
i didn &apos;t ask ,
what &apos;s his name ?
&apos;cause i didn &apos;t want to know .
i met him at a coffee shop downtown for five minutes .
he needed some letters transcribed into wila .
he gave me a key to a p.o. box near the mall .
he &apos;d leave the letters inside ,
i &apos;d pick them up once a week , transcribe them ,
take them back the next day .
there was always cash waiting for me .
all right , i &apos;m gonna show you some photos , and you &apos;re gonna ...
you &apos;re gonna point out duclair &apos;s friend , all right ?
he wore sunglasses and a baseball cap .
looked like a thousand other guys .
look , you &apos;re wasting your time with me .
whoever planted those bombs is still out there .
you transcribed those letters for duclair ,
which means you knew he was planning an escape .
that makes you an accessory ,
and that gives me the right to send you back to halawa .
give me a minute , lou .
this can &apos;t wait .
okay , we &apos;re not done , all right ?
i &apos;ll be right back .
you need to listen to this .
i think the barking dog might be a problem with the neighbors .
i know you &apos;re attached to him ,
but he needs to be put down .
consider it done .
duclair made this phone call right after you and danny
left him from up at halawa this morning .
the guys in the lab unscrambled the voice on the zip file .
the poet &apos;s voice is a direct match
to the guy who picked up this call .
all right , so richards is telling the truth .
he was the middleman ,
but duclair doesn &apos;t trust him anymore .
he wants him dead .
i think the barking dog might be a problem with the neighbors .
i know you &apos;re attached to him ,
but he needs to be put down .
consider it done .
now , i &apos;m no genius ,
but you don &apos;t have to be a genius
to figure out who the dog is .
duclair put the hit on you .
and your boy was willing to go along with it .
that bomb at your house was meant for you .
you &apos;re running out of friends real fast .
you want to stay alive ,
give us the name .
you knew all along ?
i got an itch on the end of my nose .
can one of you guys get it for me ?
get up .
you &apos;re gonna pay
for what you did to those officers , all right ?
i swear to god , as long as i live and breathe ,
you &apos;re never gonna see the light of day outside of this place .
you &apos;re gonna want to take that .
hello , commander .
who is this ?
that &apos;s not important .
what &apos;s important now is that you look out the window .
do i have your attention now ?
you had my attention this morning
when you murdered those two officers .
listen to me very carefully , commander .
you will walk out of the prison gates with mr. duclair
tomorrow morning at exactly 7 : 00 a.m.
you will wait there for further instructions .
if you fail to appear ,
you will have the blood of more innocent people on your hands .
are you still breathing , commander ?
&apos;cause that feels an awful lot like the light of day .
yeah , well , enjoy it . by the time the sun goes down ,
you &apos;re gonna be back inside .
there you go again , making promises you can &apos;t keep .
how we looking ?
gps signal &apos;s really strong .
as long as he keeps those shoes on ,
we should be able to track him wherever he goes .
danny , that burner phone
that our poet used to contact steve last night
just came back online .
we should have an exact location in a few seconds .
got a swat team that &apos;s ready to roll
as soon as we give &apos; em a location .
all right , i &apos;ll stay on with you .
danny , we got to go .
what &apos;s going on ? where is he ?
right outside the palace .
hey ! no !
don &apos;t touch it ! get back !
step away from the van !
get everybody out of the palace
and back everybody away from this van . we got to evacuate .
everybody move ! move !
i sense a road trip coming on .
you &apos;ve tracked my cell signal
and heard from your men ,
so you know your options are limited .
what do you want ?
take mr. duclair from the prison grounds
and drive north on highway 3 .
if you do anything other than that ,
&apos;iolani palace is rubble .
if your bomb squad tries to defuse the device
or anyone follows you , the bomb will be remotely detonated .
there will be no second chances .
okay , fine . where am i going ?
i &apos;ll tell you .
kono , would you please just ...
come here and sit with me ?
we had two yakuza sitting outside our house yesterday .
i knew we should &apos;ve taken up chin &apos;s offer
on a protection detail .
look , if i thought we were in danger , i would have .
you know how shioma operates .
if he sent men to hurt us ,
we never would have seen them .
okay ? he &apos;s just posturing , trying to intimidate us .
he needs us to get that money back from gabriel .
and what happens when he finds out we can &apos;t ?
the minute steve makes the drop with duclair ,
the bomb squad &apos;s gonna move in ,
they &apos;re gonna defuse the device in the van .
when that &apos;s done , we got birds standing by
to move us in on duclair &apos;s location .
and this is surveillance footage from the security camera
in the front of the palace .
got him .
nice .
all right .
andre trout , manslaughter two ,
arson first degree .
looks like he set some brushfires
back in northern california in 2003
when he was still a juvenile .
and one of &apos; em killed a firefighter .
convicted in juvie court at age 13 .
maxed out in 2013 .
dmv records have him moving to oahu last june .
wait , wasn &apos;t duclair originally from california ?
yeah , southern california . but , look , the dates don &apos;t work .
trout was inside when duclair was setting his fires .
all right , then . what &apos;s the connection ?
well , why don &apos;t we go ask him ?
you &apos;re gonna stop right up here on the right .
take these off .
don &apos;t make it any harder than it is . just do it .
well , gentlemen , it &apos;s been fun .
i &apos;m afraid this is where we have to say good @-@ bye .
yeah , for now .
this must be so hard for you guys .
this does not feel right .
we &apos;ll get him back .
and the poet , too . just trust the plan .
the plan ? yeah .
you know what mike tyson said about plans ?
&quot; everybody &apos;s got one till they get punched in the mouth . &quot;
hey , i got something .
what do you got , lou ?
found the latest verse from our poet .
what does it say ?
it says , &quot; who killed duclair ?
&quot; &apos; i , &apos; said the sparrow , &apos; with my bow and arrow.&apos;
&quot; who &apos;ll watch him burn ?
&quot; &apos; i , &apos; said the tern . &apos; with my little eye i &apos;ll watch him burn.&apos;
&quot; who &apos;ll make his shroud ?
&quot; &apos; i , &apos; said the beetle , &apos; with my thread and needle.&apos;
&quot; who will be famous ?
&quot; &apos; i , &apos; said the fish . &apos; it &apos;s my only wish . &apos; &quot;
you do realize what this means , don &apos;t you ?
trout .
trout has to be the fish .
this was never about freeing duclair .
getting worried there for a second .
we had an agreement .
you wanted their attention ,
i gave it to you .
why ?
why are you doing this ?
as the end of its life would approach ,
the phoenix would build a pyre nest ,
set it on fire
and be consumed in the flames .
after three days , the birth--
or , as some legends say , the rebirth--
the phoenix
would rise from the ashes .
where &apos;s duclair ?
call cath . find him .
i &apos;m going after trout .
hey , catherine . things did not go so well .
i need a five on duclair .
he &apos;s about 300 yards due east of the original drop spot .
and he &apos;s not moving .
duclair &apos;s gone .
i need road closures , i want air support ,
all the backup i can get .
if anybody is wearing a badge , they should be looking for this guy .
okay , uh , thank you , chin .
listen , i @-@ i &apos;ll get back to you once we have something ,
all right ? bye .
so ?
bomb squad defused the device .
palace is safe .
all right , good . finally , good news .
okay , danny , listen .
they chose this as the drop @-@ off spot
because they know the area , right ?
so that gives them an advantage .
but duclair can &apos;t get far .
i mean , he &apos;s shot , he &apos;s leaking blood , he &apos;s got no shoes .
here &apos;s what i don &apos;t get .
why would trout go through all the trouble of breaking this guy
out of jail just to kill him ?
jealousy .
maybe ... maybe trout wants to be more famous than duclair .
the last line of his note said that
fame was his only wish .
tell me you got someone in custody .
wish i could . the search units are out .
hpd &apos;s got their birds up .
the k @-@ 9 &apos;s out in full force .
cru and swat are beating the bushes ,
but so far , there &apos;s no sign of either guy .
listen to me .
i want their faces plastered everywhere .
media , internet , everywhere .
right now .
you got it .
right now .
fame . fame .
you &apos;re giving him exactly what he wants .
what choice do i have ?
anything ?
i checked every satellite , traffic cam-- nothing .
i &apos;m sorry .
best thing you can do right now ?
come home .
get some rest .
i can &apos;t find gabriel .
now i lost trout and duclair ?
how am i supposed to sleep , knowing these guys are out there ?
yeah , i knew you weren &apos;t gonna go for that .
it &apos;s who we are .
job always comes first , right ?
okay .
i &apos;m gonna go get you some coffee , then .
thank you .
hey , catherine .
i , uh ...
i @-@ i was really hoping that you and i could , uh ...
could spend some time together .
we will .
we will .
thanks for coming home .
there is no other place that i would rather be .
mcgarrett .
busy couple of days , commander .
i &apos;m gonna hunt you down . you know that , right ?
that won &apos;t be necessary .
i &apos;m not running .
the sommelier here at hy &apos;s
has paired a wonderful marinated rib eye
with a very bold scarecrow cab for me .
love for you to join .
make sure you come alone .
talk .
where do i start ?
trout was pretending to be my protégé .
said he wanted to continue my work on the outside .
i thought he had promise .
turns out he was a lot more unstable than i realized .
he did his homework , though , i &apos;ll give him that .
he knew everything about my fires .
the problem is , he didn &apos;t really know anything about me .
he didn &apos;t know that burning and killing people is who i am ,
not what i do .
okay , look , i didn &apos;t come here for a history lesson , all right ?
i want to know why trout wants to kill you .
for the same reason he started those pathetic brush fires .
fame .
yeah .
you can imagine my disappointment when i realized
he wanted to kill me all along .
why are you here ?
you could have stayed hidden , but you &apos;re here .
because i &apos;m a tortured man , commander .
i realize now i can &apos;t escape my thoughts unless
i &apos;m locked away , alone ,
with no opportunity to act on them .
in a way , it &apos;s ironic .
freedom is my prison .
okay , i &apos;m done with the couch session .
where &apos;s trout ?
it &apos;s the same po box that trout used to send me the letters .
what do i find when i get there ?
well , that would take all the fun out of it , wouldn &apos;t it ?
yeah , i guess it would .
everybody up . everybody up . let &apos;s go .
let &apos;s go . move !
let &apos;s go !
just , uh , get down on the floor , hands behind your back .
what , no dessert ?
not tonight .
come on .
don &apos;t give me any trouble .
all right .
kono , what are you ...
kono , what are you ...
stay here .
what &apos;s going on ?
they &apos;re back .
turn off the car and put your hands out the window
so i can see them .
do it now !
