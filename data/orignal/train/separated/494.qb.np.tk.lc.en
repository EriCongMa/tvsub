your text to jessica says
&quot; lost my hair . are you ready to go on your period ? &quot;
ready to send it ?

hey , buddy !
hey ! come on . get out of the road !
hey , get out of the street , man .
come on , there &apos;s--
come on , you gotta be careful , man .
there &apos;s cars comin &apos; . come on .
hey . get off me !
slow down , slow down !

come back , wait !
get them off me !
get them off me ! get them off me !
wait !
bone up on your manners and your vitamin c deficiencies , crime tigers ,
because we are going to the peachtree capital of america ,
atlanta , georgia .
what &apos;s in atlanta ?
local p.d. has invited us in for an equivocal death investigation .
this is albert stillman .
he is an investigative journalist for a local paper .
3 days ago he disappeared
on his way to talk to a source for a story ,
and last night he was killed wandering into traffic .
wait . equivocal death means we help determine
homicide versus suicide , right ?
or death by misadventure .
my point . so what happened to mr. stillman was tragic ,
but what &apos;s to equivocate ?
i mean , he had some sort of mental break , end of story .
except that he had no history of mental illness .
could this have been drug induced ?
maybe . one of his most recent stories
was an expose on an inner city drug ring ,
and he received death threats for that one .
dealers wouldn &apos;t let him loose in traffic , though .
if somebody wanted him killed , why not just shoot him ?
we have to reconstruct his life to answer that question .
reporters like stillman don &apos;t just snap .
something or someone drove him insane .
if you didn &apos;t put it there , who would , then ?
somebody else did . you have the wrong guy .
who put it there ?
if you didn &apos;t do it , who did it ? !
you have the wrong guy .
who did it , albert ?
i don &apos;t know .
who did it ? you want me to be ...
why don &apos;t you let me go ?
is that what you want ?
no , i don &apos;t . come on--
i don &apos;t want to see anything .
you see it .
you see it . you know .
why don &apos;t you let me go .
you know . you know .
and we find out who did this to you .
i &apos;ll go with you to find out who did it to you , ok ?
it &apos;s right here . this is where it goes . see it ?
answer the question . you see it . you see it .
no , i don &apos;t see it . i don &apos;t see anything .
i don &apos;t see anything .
please , let me go .
ohh ! what is it ?
dear god ! it &apos;s--
it &apos;s--it &apos;s--
i see it .
i see it !
i see it ! i see it ! i see it !
i see it !
&quot; what &apos;s the matter , you dissentious rogues ,
&quot; that rubbing the poor itch of your opinion
make yourself scabs ? &quot;
william shakespeare .
you can see why albert stillman was nominated for awards .
he wrote pieces on homeless children ,
police corruption ,
bankrolling local strip clubs .
my kind of muckraker . fights for the little guy .
those are also the kind of stories
that put him in harm &apos;s way , though . any one of them
could have gotten him killed .
it doesn &apos;t fit this m.o. , though .
we need to consider the likelihood that there is no unsub ,
that whatever happened to stillman
could have just been an accident .
what do we know about the source he was going to see
the night he disappeared ?
oy , i have an update on that , mademoiselle .
i have been talking and working with atlanta p.d. &apos; s
perfectly lovely i.t. expert .
&quot; perfectly lovely &quot; is code for not as good as you , right , baby girl ?
moi , throw shade ? never .
let &apos;s just say with a lot of my help ,
we &apos;ve managed to narrow down the possibilities
to a throwaway cell that called him
hours before his disappearance .
so it &apos;s a dead end , then .
yeah , and not the only one .
stillman &apos;s editor has dealt us an &quot; aw , come on &quot; surprise
by filing an injunction to halt the autopsy of the recently deceased body .
but we have jurisdiction here . that &apos;s pointless .
and suspicious . thanks , garcia .
all right , when we land , kate and i will go talk to the editor ,
find out what he &apos;s hiding .
dave , you and morgan re @-@ interview the witness
who tried to save stillman &apos;s life .
and reid and jj , let &apos;s move forward with the m.e.
we &apos;re not going to let an injunction stop the investigation .
so ...
thanks .
did he say anything else to you besides &quot; get off me &quot; ?
no , he just--just kind of screamed it
over and over and over .
what else was he doing ?
i don &apos;t know , man , the guy was a schizo .
ok , i hear you . but any details you can give us
about what he was saying or how he was saying it
might help us figure out what happened to him .
the whole time , he was ... hitting the air .
like he was fighting someone ?
yeah . except i don &apos;t think it was someone ,
i think it was something .
a lot of somethings ,
because right before he ...
you know ...
he looked right at me and he said ...
get them off me !
&quot; them . &quot;
you think he said &quot; get them off me &quot; ?
yeah , i think so .
what do you think it was ?
i don &apos;t know .
but it couldn &apos;t have been good .
agents , i appreciate you coming down here ,
but i have nothing to say to you about the injunction .
a newspaper editor telling the fbi &quot; no comment . &quot;
that &apos;s ironic .
i think we &apos;re done here .
no , sir , we &apos;re not . this is a pointless exercise .
tomorrow we &apos;ll be back with a warrant
and we &apos;ll get the answers we came for .
unless that &apos;s the point .
waste our time and buy some more of your own .
time ? to do what ?
get ahead of the story . one of your own is dead .
that reflects badly on you .
albert stillman deserves some privacy .
he was my friend .
then cooperate .
because if a friend of mine died the way yours did ,
i wouldn &apos;t rest until i got to the bottom of it .
his behavior seemed like a psychosis
from binge methamphetamine or cocaine use .
go the other direction .
benzos .
downers .
for his back .
and when he couldn &apos;t get any more ,
i tried to get it for him ,
but by then he wasn &apos;t interested .
&apos;cause he &apos;d moved on to something cheaper , like street heroin .
that &apos;s why i filed the injunction .
i didn &apos;t want you or the police
to look at a toxicology report and write him off as another junkie .
i think there &apos;s more to it than that .
yeah , so do we .
what do you know about the source he was going to meet ?
not much . all he told me ,
he was writing a piece on , uh , vaccinations .
i &apos;d like to see his notes .
he kept it all up here .
said it was the one hard drive
nobody could hack or subpoena .
so whatever that last story was ,
it died with him .
how we doing , beautiful ?
my perfectly coiffed eyebrows furrowed in concern .
do you know that throwaway cell
phone that called albert stillman ?
it made another call this morning
to a dr. william suri .
he is a research scientist in entomology , of all things .
baby girl , hold on a second .
this guy work at barnett college ?
i know you guys are psychic , but how did you do that ?
they &apos;ve been dealing with some college incident all morning .
i &apos;ll call you back .
officer . the incident at the college-- what do we know ?
all we got is there was a fight in the research lab ,
but nobody saw anything . it &apos;s locked up now .
detectives are heading over .
all right , we need that address .
no forced entry .
dr. suri let his attacker in .
this wasn &apos;t an assault , it was an abduction .
what do we know about this guy ?
well , according to his assistant ,
he was published but controversial .
controversial . we &apos;re talking about bugs , right ?
he had extreme theories
on the impact humans have on insect mating habits .
this is probably the doctor &apos;s cell phone .
whoever did this made sure to leave it behind .
didn &apos;t want us tracing him through gps
because of the unsub &apos;s organization .
it also means this isn &apos;t an equivocal death investigation anymore .
this is serial .
spence . the m.e. has something we need to see right away .
you .
what are you doing to me ?
what do you want ?
you said you wanted proof .
so you attack me ?
you bring me to this place ? !
where are we ?
do you see it ?
please tell me that is not my blood .
no . no , it &apos;s mine .
don &apos;t you see anything strange about it ?
i--i need to look at it under a slide , run some tests--
what are you talking about ?
it &apos;s right there in front of you . it &apos;s black !
no , it &apos;s not . what are you talking about ?
ah ! you &apos;ve corrupted the sample .
how could i have corrupted the sample ? !
look at me ! look what you &apos;re doing to me !
i &apos;m tied to a chair !
now , i--i have listened to you .
i have entertained all of your theories .
but what you have described to me ...
it is not possible .
it might be real to you ,
but that is ...
that is because you are sick .
yeah .
you &apos;re right .
let me show you what it feels like to be sick like i am !
no !
duct tape residue was found on his wrist , ankles , and neck .
so he was held against his will ?
yeah .
it &apos;s the rest of it i can &apos;t explain .
the victim &apos;s own skin was found under his fingernails .
the fingernails were in turn gouged into different parts of his body .
he broke them off scratching himself ?
yeah . and kept scratching all the
way down to his subcutaneous layer on his index and middle fingers .
are these track marks consistent with heroin abuse ?
oh , yeah . tox screen came back positive , too .
when was the last time he shot up ?
based on scar tissue , i &apos;d say about a week ago .
ok , so he was kicking when the unsub held him .
one of the withdrawal symptoms of that
is it feels like your skin is on fire .
you can &apos;t help but scratch .
think about this for a second .
stillman was bound , but the unsub cut him loose .
he wanted him to scratch .
that tells us this isn &apos;t torture .
if it were torture , he would have never taken the duct tape off .
what if it &apos;s an expression of his own pain ?
maybe the unsub wants his victims to feel
what &apos;s going on inside of him .
which is ?
welts on the skin behind his ear .
some sort of external irritant the unsub introduced .
saw that , too .
lab &apos;s running tests .
i don &apos;t know , a bite , maybe ?
wait--wait--
wait ! wait .
what are you doing ?
what are you doing , please ? !
no , no , no !
no , no , please don &apos;t-- please don &apos;t do this !
no , you &apos;re right ! i hear you , i hear you .
please . please . don &apos;t do this !
i beg you , please don &apos;t do this !
please think about this . you &apos;re right ! please stop it !
don &apos;t , don &apos;t , please ! don &apos;t do this to me .
we can talk about this .
i want to talk about this . please , please , don &apos;t do it !
no ! oh , no ! no , stop it !
oh , no , please !
no more , please ! please stop it !
no , no ! you &apos;re right ! no , stop it !
oh , my god ! no !
no ! please stop it ! please stop it !
oh , stop it ! i can &apos;t breathe !
i can &apos;t breathe !
oh , please ! stop it !
so , we found william suri .
yeah . garbage truck almost ran over him this morning .
our unsub didn &apos;t hold him as long .
then he shot him pointblank in the head .
big change in m.o.
not necessarily . he shows less signs of scratching ,
but the bite marks are definitely there .
so , the unsub wants this guy to itch ,
the good doctor doesn &apos;t play along ,
bang , he ends the torture early .
i don &apos;t think this is torture for the unsub .
i think it &apos;s a delusion .
can i have those tweezers ?
what kind of delusion ?
bugs .
we need to deliver the profile .
we believe the unsub we &apos;re looking for suffers from delusional parasitosis ,
a condition in which the patient believes
that he &apos;s being attacked or infested by bugs .
he takes his victims and covers them in insects ,
cockroaches specifically .
we think it &apos;s to convince his victims
that they share in his condition .
is he trying to get them sick so he can kill them ?
murder isn &apos;t his goal , attention is .
believe it or not , this unsub is crying out for help .
he kidnapped an investigative journalist
because he wanted albert stillman
to write a story about the bugs inside of him .
unfortunately , because stillman was suddenly experiencing
opiate withdrawal ,
he was already hallucinating insects ,
and this led to a psychotic break .
so the unsub changed tactics .
he kidnapped a controversial research scientist
who he thought would be more willing to believe him .
but we think dr. suri recognized his condition
for the mental illness that it is .
that &apos;s why he killed him so quickly .
it is important that we not label this unsub
as crazy or insane to the media or press .
he &apos;s desperate to confirm his own self @-@ diagnosis
and he &apos;ll be violent towards those who don &apos;t .
and this kind of delusion goes hand in hand with conspiracy thinking .
he probably believes the bugs are part of a plot
involving the government to keep him sick .
when he &apos;s alone , he &apos;ll be paranoid and disorganized .
his body will be mutilated from self @-@ harm .
but his search for a fellow believer
will give him focus and allow him to appear calm and rational .
we should be canvassing the entomology and infectious disease fields
as well as reviewing hospital intake records .
this unsub has searched high and low for treatment for his condition ,
and we believe that he &apos;ll return to one of these locations
for his next victim . thank you .
i think that we have time for one more share .
anybody ?
go ahead , jane .
so , i went back to the dermatologist ,
and she again tried to tell me what my problem was .
you know , she said that it was maybe mold
or static electricity .
i mean , can you think about that ,
that &apos;s what &apos;s going on inside my body could be--
because of static electricity ? just ...
and then she had the nerve to try and sell me a salve .
and when i looked to see what was inside the salve ,
it was st. john &apos;s wort .
i mean , really , do you think i haven &apos;t &apos; already tried st . john &apos;s wort ?
and i just ...
and i could see it
really clearly now , you know ?
it &apos;s not me .
it &apos;s society .
you know ? they want me to be sick .
because if i &apos;m sick , if it &apos;s me ,
they can keep ignoring me .
but i won &apos;t be ignored anymore .
thank you for letting me share .
ok , why don &apos;t we stand up and join hands
and end our meeting with our prayer .
lord , grant me the wisdom to see the light ...
hi . i &apos;m leo .
the strength to believe the truth ...
serenity with my body ...
the courage to know how to ...
there &apos;s an inherent contradiction in who this unsub is .
only one ?
all right , humor me .
this guy has a phobia of insects , right ?
so why subject his victims to the very thing he hates ?
it &apos;s not a phobia .
well , maybe not , but the bugs disgust him .
labels are important here .
the original name for this was entomophobia ,
which is , yes , the fear / disgust at being bitten , being stung ,
or the fear of future infestation ,
but if you have delusional parasitosis ,
you believe you &apos;re already infested .
present tense , not future tense .
so his worst fear has come true .
what he wants now is exposure .
he believes if society and the
scientific community take him seriously ,
maybe he &apos;ll get relief .
yeah , but that &apos;s impossible if it &apos;s all in his head .
the more people that tell him that ,
the more angry he &apos;s gonna get .
which is why he &apos;ll take solace in people
who are as frustrated as he is .
guys , there &apos;s a suspect pool we &apos;ve been missing all along .
i &apos;m here for helping .
garcia , i &apos;m going to run through a series
of debated and controversial diseases .
i want you to tell me if there are
any support groups in the area .
hit me .
fibromyalgia .
no .
chronic fatigue syndrome .
no .
recurrent lyme disease .
negative .
morgellons ?
there &apos;s a magellan &apos;s astronomy club that meets on tuesdays .
no , morgellons .
m @-@ o @-@ r @-@ g @-@ e @-@ l @-@ l @-@ o @-@ n @-@ s .
huh . those vowels will get ya .
checking now .
i &apos;ll bite . what &apos;s morgellons ?
it &apos;s a syndrome where sufferers believe they have
disease @-@ causing fibers under their skin .
they collect them only to
later be told by dermatologists
that all they &apos;ve found is lint , dead skin ,
or their own picked scabs .
sounds like it &apos;s on the ocd spectrum .
there &apos;s a lot of overlap . there &apos;s also patients
who insist the fibers are insect like in nature .
yeah , update . there &apos;s a morgellons group
that gets together tonight , actually . just missed then .
garcia , we need an address .
done .
jj , you and morgan go and see if they &apos;ll talk to us .
no , no , no , no .
the drinking water .
drinking wa ...
you think they put it in the drinking water ?
yeah , that &apos;s the easiest way to infect us .
that means everyone &apos;s sick .
everyone is sick .
see , but you and i , we react to it differently . right ?
we feel it differently .
that &apos;s what makes us special .
so ...
if it &apos;s this thing that i have ...
we have .
that we have ...
is real--
oh , it &apos;s very real .
how do i get people to believe us ?
i was getting really close ,
and that &apos;s when they tried to kill me .
they tried to kill you ?
when you worked at ...
well , how do you live with that ?
they could just come and get you anytime .
actually , i &apos;m grateful .
&apos;cause whatever they did to me ,
it turned up the volume , ok ?
it improved my intuition , my instincts .
when something &apos;s wrong , it comes out more .
while we &apos;ve been sitting here , it hasn &apos;t come out once .
that tells me something .
i haven &apos;t felt it either .
see ?
maybe that &apos;s the cure .
you and me .
maybe .
how bad does it get for you ?
pretty bad .
do you want to see ?
yeah , but ... not here .
let &apos;s get out of here .
why am i not surprised that the fbi
is showing up at my meetings ?
look , we &apos;re just asking if you can think of anyone
who might fit our profile .
oh , i &apos;ll tell you what i think .
i think this is the same tactic
that the fbi pulls over and over again .
occupy , wto , anti @-@ war groups ,
only this time , you people are really
scraping the bottom of the barrel .
i &apos;ll bet that you even worked out
a little shakedown speech on the way over .
hey , weirdoes , we support your right for free assembly ,
but there might be a serial killer among you ,
so watch your back .
right ? you want us scared .
you want us isolated .
that way it &apos;s easier for you to
tell us morgellons is made up .
ms. randall , we have no opinion about your condition
one way or the other .
do you see this man ?
his name is albert stillman .
and this man .
dr. william suri .
do you see him ?
this is not made up . this is real .
the man we &apos;re looking for
thinks he has cockroaches inside of him .
he &apos;d be quiet . not demonstrative .
probably not comfortable sharing to the entire group ,
but very convincing one on one .
ms. randall , do you know anyone like that ?
no .
no one .
what makes you think that he would even show up here ?
&apos;cause your group would listen to what he has to say ,
and you &apos;d believe him .
but that doesn &apos;t mean we &apos;re like him .
no , it doesn &apos;t .
but it could mean you &apos;re his next target .
you sure ?
yeah .
you ready ?
1 ...
sorry .
i didn &apos;t want you to tense up .
no , it &apos;s ok .
it &apos;s worse when you tense up .
oh , it &apos;s perfect .
uh , can you hand me a slide ?
all right .
all right , look .
they should be wiggling .
can you see them ?
please see them .
i see them .
thank you .
are they only in your blood ?
no .
they &apos;re everywhere .
tell me again that it &apos;s real .
it &apos;s real .
can you heal me ?
yeah . i can .
where are we on the e.r. intake ?
garcia weeded out the mental health transfers .
no one fits .
our best bet is still the morgellons group .
when &apos;s their next meeting ?
next week .
it &apos;s too long to wait .
we could take another shot at the leader .
there &apos;s definitely something that she was holding back .
you had thought she wouldn &apos;t rattle .
she won &apos;t . we &apos;re gonna have to find some other way in .
top of the morning , fellow leprechauns .
where did lisa randall go after she met with jj and morgan ?
according to her credit card ...
drugstores .
5 of them , to be precise .
and she bought a single item 5 times .
diaper rash cream .
all right , thanks .
jj , see if she &apos;ll come in and talk .
reid , i need you to go to the drugstore .
you sleep ?
i never really sleep .
hi , jane , honey , come on . quick like a bunny .
oh , it &apos;s lisa .
what the hell is she doing here ?
well , she takes me to the meetings sometimes .
hey , open this door !
open this door right now !
hi , honey , it &apos;s me . are you in there ?
jane , open this door !
get rid of her .
calm down . she &apos;s one of us , right ?
are you in there ?
don &apos;t .
i want to see who it is .
hello ?
it &apos;s probably--
no .
be quiet .
yes , agent jareau .
yes . yes , i &apos;ll come down to the station .
she--she &apos;s talking to the police ?
why would she talk to the police like that ?
no , no , she called somebody an agent .
that--that &apos;s not the police , it &apos;s the fed .
what do they want with us ?
i &apos;ll take care of it . just hold on .
ms. randall , i &apos;m aaron hotchner with the fbi .
i have already told the other agents everything that i have to say .
do you know why you itch ?
well , my neurologist tried
to explain it as simply as he could to me
so i would stop coming to his office .
my amygdala , which is the emotional center of my brain ,
has hijacked my prefrontal cortex ,
which is the rational side .
so in times of stress , i itch .
but , look at me now .
i &apos;m in the fbi office being questioned .
one would think that would be a very stressful thing
for anyone and i &apos;m not itching .
how old was she when she died ?
excuse me ?
did she make it to her third birthday ?
i don &apos;t know who you talked to ,
but you have no right .
i haven &apos;t talked to anyone .
i &apos;m trained to see what &apos;s in front of me .
i notice that you don &apos;t
wear a wedding ring under your gloves .
i think a condition like yours makes it difficult
to build intimate relationships .
i know you looked everywhere for some sort of relief .
doctors &apos; prescriptions , antihistamines . none of it worked .
nothing until you found this .
this works , doesn &apos;t it ?
yes .
someone who &apos;s not a mother
doesn &apos;t stumble on a cure like that by accident .
what was her name ?
olivia .
she was a preemie .
so she was in and out of hospitals a lot .
her skin at the end ...
i guess it was from the tests and everything .
i was a new parent .
do you know that feeling of , am i doing it right ?
am i helping ?
you know ? you just don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m also trained to listen to what people say ,
and that question , am i helping ?
you ask yourself that every day , don &apos;t you ?
i know you help the people who come to your meetings .
i know you want to help us .
i do ?
yes , you do . because there &apos;s a man
who comes to your meetings who puts you on edge ,
and your instincts of self @-@ preservation
are telling you not to trust him ,
and those instincts are always right .
who is he ?
his name is leo .
i don &apos;t have his number or anything ,
but i did see him talking to
one of my friends last night - jane .
i knocked on her door this morning .
she didn &apos;t answer , but there was someone inside
because i heard them whispering .
i need jane &apos;s information immediately .
jane posner , this is the fbi . open up !
oh , my god . oh , my god .
open the door , jane .
no . no . he was right .
we &apos;re not looking for you . we &apos;re looking for leo .
he &apos;s not here .
he &apos;s gone .
clear .
and you &apos;re never gonna find him .
thank you so much .
have you ever heard of a folie a deux , jane ?
it &apos;s where two people suffer from the same delusional belief .
we &apos;re not delusional .
he gets me .
all right .
then tell us where he is
so we can understand what the two of you have .
you &apos;ll kill him .
we &apos;re not killers .
we &apos;re his best hope for getting better .
all we want to do is get him the help he needs .
why should i believe you ?
you already tried to kill him once .
when was that ?
don &apos;t play dumb . with the vaccinations .
what vaccinations ?
i don &apos;t have to talk to you . so ...
no , all you got to do is listen .
&apos;cause the closer we get to the truth ,
the more you &apos;re going to be compelled to itch .
the first victim who met leo
was going to write a story about vaccinations .
is that how this all started ,
because leo got vaccinations ?
that &apos;s a yes .
find out who gave him the vaccinations ,
we find leo .
was it his doctor ?
nope , wasn &apos;t his doctor .
must have been work , then .
was it the military ? did leo serve ?
it &apos;s not military .
did he work in medicine ?
is it the hospital ? is that where he worked ?
or was it something more like infectious diseases ?
&apos;cause you &apos;d have to get vaccinated for that .
like the center for disease control ,
right here in atlanta .
leave him alone .
let &apos;s go .
what did you tell them ?
i didn &apos;t say anything .
yes , you did .
no , i didn &apos;t . i didn &apos;t say anything .
yes , you did .
let &apos;s go .
let &apos;s go .
leo jenkins . haven &apos;t thought of him in a while .
our search told us he worked here 6 months ago ,
but his address isn &apos;t current .
yeah , he asked me to send
his last check to a different address .
he was pretty paranoid by the end .
because of the vaccinations ?
which he didn &apos;t even need .
i mean , he was a low @-@ level lab assistant ,
for god &apos;s sake . we were trying to help him .
why would you give him shots he didn &apos;t need ?
leo had a painful case of shingles in his left arm .
one of the docs around here
gave him the antiviral acyclovir ,
which , uh , deadened the nerves in his arm ...
altogether . here &apos;s his address .
how did that lead to cockroaches ?
your brain and nervous system
work on a best @-@ guess feedback loop .
the nerves might be dead ,
but your brain hasn &apos;t figured that out yet .
it &apos;s still sending stimuli to the dead nerves
in an attempt to get them to react .
like an amputee who has feeling in his phantom limb .
exactly . leo started scratching and he couldn &apos;t stop .
well , we told him the
feelings will come back when the drugs wore off ,
but , uh , he insisted that
we &apos;d put cockroach larvae in his vaccine .
that it was a conspiracy , that we were all trying to kill him .
we tried almost everything to talk him out of it .
well , almost everything .
what didn &apos;t you try ?
leo , the fbi is looking for you .
yeah , i know they are .
what i don &apos;t know is who you are .
i had to rethink everything i know about you .
at the meetings , when you shared
about pulling the fibers from your body
and you said they felt like spider legs ...
you talked about how that made you feel crazy
&apos;cause you &apos;re afraid of spider legs ?
but is that true ?
are you afraid of spiders , lisa ?
yes .
you are ?
yes .
no ... you don &apos;t have to do this .
no , i do have to . i do have to ,
because , see , i don &apos;t know what the truth is anymore .
no .
see , you and i are gonna have a little chat .
come on , leo .
i &apos;ll just tell you anything that you want to know .
just tell me what you want to know .
it &apos;s simple . who do you work for ?
i don &apos;t--i don &apos;t work for anybody .
who do you work for ? who do you work for ?
i don &apos;t work for anybody !
i just don &apos;t work for anybody .
i &apos;ll tell you i just don &apos;t work for ...
you don &apos;t work for anybody ? you &apos;re unemployed ?
i don &apos;t know what you want me to say .
who do you work for ? ok ?
we &apos;ll keep going . we &apos;ll keep going until you give me ...
who do you work for ?
i don &apos;t work for anybody !
no !
it &apos;s very simple !
i don &apos;t work for anybody !
who do you work for ? !
fbi ! don &apos;t move !
oh , god .
of course .
she works for you , doesn &apos;t she ?
we &apos;re not here for her . we &apos;re here to talk to you .
how about you let her go and we &apos;ll do that .
you want to talk ? then how come these things
in my arms are going crazy , huh ?
i know how this goes , ok ?
i know how this goes . you shoot me
and then you cover up the whole thing . that &apos;s how it goes .
is it happening now ?
of course it &apos;s happening now .
don &apos;t tell me you don &apos;t see it .
come on , you see it .
you see it !
i can make it go away .
now , is that your phone ?
yeah , that &apos;s my phone .
don &apos;t -- what are you doing ?
now , look at the camera .
what ? i &apos;ve shot video footage of myself a million times .
you guys do something to it and the image is gone .
it &apos;s gone . you guys do something to it .
i &apos;m not shooting video .
this is a reflection .
now look at it . go ahead , look .
look at your arm .
is it going away ?
that &apos;s a trick .
it &apos;s no trick .
how did you do that ?
we can make them go away forever .
but you have to let her go , leo .
what ? leo ?
how the hell do you know my name ? !
don &apos;t move , don &apos;t even flinch .
get &apos; em off , get &apos; em off , get &apos; em off , get &apos; em off !
see &apos; em , see &apos; em , see &apos; em , see &apos; em ? right there .
right there .
i got &apos; em . i got &apos; em . ok .
i got &apos; em .
so that &apos;s it ?
you ruin my life , now i &apos;m free to go ?
you &apos;re not an accessory .
you didn &apos;t know what leo was doing . so ,
yeah , you &apos;re free to go .
you killed him , didn &apos;t you ?
i told you , we &apos;re not killers .
i don &apos;t believe you .
you used me .
you tricked me so you could get him .
jane , hey .
jane .
would you just listen to me for a second , ok ?
get away from me .
ok , yeah , i had a job to do
and i &apos;m not going to apologize for that .
but that doesn &apos;t mean that this is over .
leo , he still needs you .
how ?
he has a good chance of pleading insanity ,
and he is going to need someone on his side
to explain his condition to the court .
oh , yeah . &apos; cause if he &apos;s insane ,
you could put him away forever .
of course you didn &apos;t kill him ,
&apos;cause that would make a martyr out of him .
but if he &apos;s crazy , no one will ever know what i know .
nobody . which is that he &apos;s right !
ok ? about the government
and the drinking water
and you . all of it !
he was going to kill lisa .
he -- he wouldn &apos;t do that .
i was there .
he had a gun to her head .
lies .
lies , lies , and more lies .
and you fbi jackbooted thugs
will do anything to protect yourselves
from him exposing you
as the filthy liars that you are .
rossi , that was a pretty gutsy move .
how &apos;d you know it was gonna work ?
the doc at the cdc told us about
something they wanted to try
but never got around to .
it &apos;s called a mirror box .
oh , i read about that treatment .
what &apos;s this treatment ?
it &apos;s for amputees with searing pain in their phantom limbs .
basically , you take a patient ,
you put them in front of a mirror
and you tell them to conduct a symphony ,
to wave , or just to relax .
when their brain sees what &apos;s not there ,
the pain goes away .
and since the unsub had dead nerves in his arm
due to the shingles antiviral ...
you could argue that his itch
was the same thing as phantom limb pain ,
i mean from a brain @-@ nervous system feedback loop .
my hope was that the trick would make the itch go away ,
and it did , for a few seconds , anyway .
i can understand being driven crazy
by something you can &apos;t scratch ,
but killing people over it , that &apos;s what surprises me .
there is one documented case about a woman
who couldn &apos;t stop scratching , even when she was asleep .
she woke up one morning realizing she &apos;d scratched
through her own scalp , her skull ,
and directly into her brain tissue .
ok , on that note ,
my ride &apos;s here .
how did it go with jane ?
she blames us for everything .
now she &apos;s gonna go back to the group
and we &apos;ll be their new excuse for why they can &apos;t get better .
how do we help somebody like that ?
well , one of them &apos;s feeling better already .
&quot; getting rid of a delusion
makes us wiser than getting hold of the truth . &quot;
