this is all you ever wanted --
this lifestyle , this house .
i wish you &apos;d give me a chance to explain .
why would i give you anything , emily ?
you guys want a bump ?
miss , step back and put your hands on your head , please .
she &apos;s family .
fine .
i wonder what gideon wants with her ,
as if squeezing her brother out of lemarchal wasn &apos;t enough .
daniel stepped down of his own volition .
i am curious what daniel would say
if you asked him about the redhead .
i &apos;d been partying with this girl ,
and when i woke up , i found her o.d. &apos; d .
gideon took a photo of her and used it to blackmail me .
how did you get out ?
with a little help from my friends .
fire !
welcome back .
going somewhere ?
southampton .
i got some unfinished business .
you &apos;re awake .
david ?
i &apos;m sorry i frightened you .
when i saw you outside the manor last night ,
i -- i had to get to you .
oh , david .
it &apos;s you .
i can &apos;t .
not until i know the truth .
the truth ?
i told myself that conrad was the mastermind ...
and that you were as much a victim as i was .
i just need to hear that from you .
david , i loved you .
then tell me the truth .
i shouldn &apos;t have come . this was a mistake .
goodbye , vee .
it &apos;s true .
david , i was scared .
i didn &apos;t have a choice .
i &apos;ve regretted that moment ever since .
oh , david .
oh , david .
you assured me that an escape would be impossible .
if you don &apos;t erase every trace of victoria &apos;s stay
at your facility , dr. miller ,
then i can assure you
that the feds will be the least of your worries .
take care of it .
wrong number ?
i &apos;m actually impressed that victoria got out .
at least now if she goes to the authorities ,
there will be no record of her at claremont .
i &apos;m sorry . could you repeat that ?
because all i could hear was the sound
of my revenge @-@ free summer be strangled to death
by a web of thorns .
i need you to help me find her .
ems , we talked about this . i &apos;m not gonna be your enabler .
this isn &apos;t just about me , nolan .
it &apos;s about aiden and every other terrible thing victoria has done .
track her down .
i can &apos;t . no . really .
ems , i already tried .
she took a car service
from the loony bin to your front stoop for the bitch @-@ off ,
and then she disappeared .
well , so , keep looking . she &apos;s got to be somewhere .
well , let &apos;s say i find victoria .
then what ?
you &apos;ve done everything short of killing her .
if victoria told anyone that you locked her up
and then they find her dead , you &apos;re the prime suspect .
well , then we have to make sure she hasn &apos;t .
can you track charlotte and daniel down ?
the two people that hate you almost as much as victoria ?
of course . i &apos;m sure they &apos;ll be delighted to see you .
i don &apos;t like being on the defensive .
then find her , and i &apos;ll end this for good .
39 .
never knew maseratis could go under the speed limit .
come on . these people have no idea what they &apos;re driving .
they just buy whatever &apos;s got the biggest price tag .
you know how your friends are .
yeah , well , trust me . they &apos;re not all my friends .
well , emily thorne is .
she just bought the biggest house in southampton
without so much as a boyfriend to live there with her .
i &apos;m sure she has her reasons .
reasons for buying the house
or why she doesn &apos;t have a boyfriend ?
so , how do you know her , again ?
she , uh -- she was friends with my wife .
amanda clarke , right ?
sorry , man , i mean , it never came up .
i just -- i didn &apos;t know . - it &apos;s okay .
believe it or not , um , she and emily met in juvie .
emily is an ex @-@ con ? man .
this girl is full of surprises .
not really .
oh , come on . don &apos;t be so shy , porter .
i knew my last partner &apos;s passwords and pin number .
just comes with the territory
when you &apos;re trusting somebody with your life .
so , what is her story ?
it &apos;s gonna have to wait . light &apos; em up .
the meeting is set . is he still there ?
for now . i &apos;m working on it .
well , work harder .
hey . you came to me with this .
you want my help , you &apos;re gonna have to trust me .
once we &apos;re done ,
gideon will be out of your company
and charlotte &apos;s life ...
permanently .
you &apos;re a good brother , daniel .
consider yours officially delayed .
help ! help me !
please help me ! help ! help !
i &apos;ve waited too long for this .
there &apos;s no way that i &apos;m gonna lose you again .
you have no power over me !
oh , i have the power .
and my secrets are gonna rot inside of you
beyond your last breath ,
because you are gonna keep
your stupid and thankless mouth shut !
bitch had a camera on her and didn &apos;t even know it ?
i cannot believe you are dating this idiot .
i know .
not as hot as you , of course .
clearly ,
or you wouldn &apos;t be texting me every minute she &apos;s not around .
she &apos;s like a cash machine for my blow .
are you kidding me ? !
you &apos;ve been using me and sleeping with her ? !
c @-@ charlotte , we -- we were just --
save it !
i thought you cared .
of course i do , babe , but ...
i mean , we partied . i @-@ i @-@ i gave you some advice .
i was never your boyfriend .
she &apos;s even more pathetic than i thought .
charlotte ! babe !
just about to hop in an elevator , so i might lose you .
what &apos;s up ?
i just caught the guy i was seeing cheating on me .
who ? gideon ?
you know ?
you show up to parties with him .
i &apos;m gonna hear even if you don &apos;t tell me .
i say good riddance .
thank you for your support .
speaking of ...
i got a call from your landlord , said your rent &apos;s late .
what happened to that check i wrote you ?
daniel , i -- i &apos;m so sorry .
what did you do ?
i cashed it .
let me guess -- to party with gideon .
i made a mistake .
daniel , things have been really hard lately .
no , no , no , no , no .
do you have any idea what i went through to get that money ? !
i can &apos;t help you right now .
daniel , wait !
what the hell are you doing here ?
just scoping out the place for a friend who &apos;s coming to town .
friend ?
i didn &apos;t think you had any .
i can &apos;t imagine you made any
at that disastrous party you threw at my old house .
just trying to keep up grayson tradition .
there are no grayson traditions
because there &apos;s no grayson family left .
well , i heard your mother &apos;s back in town .
well , you heard wrong .
you know , it &apos;s just sick
how you two live to destroy each other .
i suggest you follow her lead and disappear .
where are you taking me ?
keep going .
this is not a dream , victoria .
but you were murdered .
i &apos;ve seen your grave .
this is my grave .
i learned that corpnews c.e.o. jerry thomas
is planning to retire .
this is the perfect opportunity for us to absorb the news giant .
have you forgotten how many times your father tried and failed ?
i am not my father , francois .
and if my recent track record has not convinced you ,
i assure you acquiring corpnews will .
i will be lunching with jerry this afternoon .
without gideon ? he &apos;s head of acquisitions .
well , his absence here today
speaks to his overall lack of reliability .
i will not leave this deal in the hands of ...
my very capable hands . not to worry , francois .
i will be taking this lunch alone ,
and i guarantee delivery of corpnews .
what are the odds of getting four flat tires ?
you don &apos;t even have the courtesy to make up a good excuse .
this isn &apos;t primary school , gideon .
no , it is not .
back then , dad could have cared less about his silly little daughter .
he promised his legacy to his son .
and yet , he chose me .
and the board will correct his mistake once i deliver corpnews .
nice try .
last one .
oh , my muse .
i couldn &apos;t have done this without you , girl .
you know better than to disturb a genius at work .
well , genius ,
charlotte &apos;s not where your tracking device says she is .
i &apos;m at the hotel and i don &apos;t see her .
well , i &apos;m sure it &apos;s just human error .
ems , check under your manolos .
you &apos;re right on top of each other .
i am telling you , nolan . she is not ...
oh , my god .
charlotte !
go away ! don &apos;t come any closer !
you don &apos;t want to do this .
you don &apos;t know what i want !
or care .
that &apos;s not true , charlotte .
then where were you before now ? !
i &apos;ve been trying . i &apos;ll try harder .
this isn &apos;t about you !
why don &apos;t you just leave me alone like everyone else has ? !
just please let me explain .
we can talk this through . i promise .
i &apos;m begging you , charlotte . please don &apos;t do this .
oh , god .
jumper &apos;s been apprehended . situation &apos;s under control .
come on . you &apos;re all right .
so this is where you &apos;ve been ?
i &apos;ll handle the questions .
you owe me some answers .
i &apos;ve had 20 years to piece together
the conspiracy that destroyed my life .
but i still have one unanswered question .
did you betray me ?
david , the night i lost you ,
my heart broke and it never mended .
when i found out what conrad had done ,
i went straight to the d.a. to testify ,
but conrad intercepted me .
for years ...
he kept me in silence by threatening my children .
our child .
i had no choice , so i became the good wife ...
until i couldn &apos;t stand it anymore .
you were always the love of my life , david .
always .
no . no .
i &apos;m not gonna hurt you . i believe you .
i still love you , vee .
i always have .
you see , this is why we don &apos;t give people a pass .
i can &apos;t believe charlotte almost ...
well , she didn &apos;t . all right ? she &apos;s gonna be fine , man .
most of the jumpers that i &apos;ve seen ,
they &apos;re just doing it to try to get attention .
what if this is worse than that ?
that &apos;s for the psychiatrist to decide .
you better get that checked out .
you landed pretty hard on that shoulder .
no , i &apos;m fine .
i thought you said we don &apos;t give people a pass .
come on . while you &apos;re getting a clean bill
of health from the medics ,
i &apos;ll check on charlotte at the hospital .
deal . meet me back at the station .
i &apos;ll catch a ride on the rig .
she &apos;s lucky that you were here .
what were you doing here ?
did she call you ?
no , i @-@ i was just visiting a friend .
it was a coincidence .
that &apos;s some coincidence .
especially considering from the small part
of the conversation that i heard ,
you two seem to have quite a history .
so , who were you meeting ?
your friend ?
look , i almost lost someone really important to me up there ,
so ...
no , of course . i understand .
but whatever &apos;s going on with you two ,
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll get past it .
she owes you her life .
well , actually , she owes you .
thank you . excuse me .
i &apos;m here to meet jerry thomas .
of course , mr. lemarchal .
let me see if he &apos;s ready for you .
stay the hell away from my sister .
did charlotte call her big brother to come beat me up ?
that &apos;s pretty pathetic , daniel .
let go , or i &apos;ll have that picture
of you and the dead redhead
on every news blog in seconds .
screw you .
i &apos;ll give you a call
when your sister o.d. &apos; s .
daniel grayson .
miles vanburen from the ledger .
thanks for the invite .
miles . glad you could make it .
how about a drink ?
i &apos;m having deja vu .
all i &apos;m missing is the blindfold .
you have to stop doing this .
you &apos;re driving yourself crazy .
oh , right , it &apos;s my fault you put me through hell .
the shrink told you to take me home ?
no . what the doctor said is you need to be with family
who can help you through this .
let go of me !
i don &apos;t want to be here with her or you !
charlotte . charlotte . charlotte . please . please .
look , i know that you don &apos;t trust me anymore ,
but i am not lying to you when i say
she &apos;s the only person in the world
you need to be listening to right now .
the doctor was right .
you should be with family right now .
thanks . i &apos;ll do that .
i &apos;m the one who kidnapped you , charlotte .
i can &apos;t stand seeing you like this .
i know i did the wrong thing ,
but you have to believe i did it for all the right reasons .
what are you saying ?
i &apos;m your sister , charlotte .
i &apos;m amanda .
i &apos;m sorry that i scared you .
prison taught me that only when people are truly afraid
can you see who they really are .
believing that you are innocent is all that kept me alive .
how are you alive ?
the world thought that you were stabbed 10 years ago .
i was .
they rushed me to the infirmary .
i blacked out from the pain .
and then , when i came to , i was out .
where were you ?
were you in here ?
i &apos;m sorry .
the less you know , the better , for now .
it &apos;s for your own safety
and the safety of our daughter .
i need to protect charlotte .
i wasn &apos;t able to do that for amanda .
and now she &apos;s gone .
you heard .
what happened on that boat was a terrible tragedy .
i can &apos;t lose anyone else .
i want to be in charlotte &apos;s life , and in yours .
s @-@ say something .
it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s been years .
and a lot &apos;s happened .
i thought you were dead .
and then you kidnap me and bring me here
without explaining where you &apos;ve been ,
and you say you want to pick up where we left off , and ...
i know it &apos;s a lot ,
but we can get through it , right ?
you don &apos;t want an honest answer .
if you did , you would get me out of here
instead of making me your prisoner .
prisoner ?
okay . fine . let &apos;s go .
you know , i &apos;d be lying if i said i didn &apos;t expect
lemarchal to crumble after your father &apos;s death ,
but your sister seems to have stabilized the company
in only six months .
you should know my sister &apos;s just a pretty face .
i &apos;m the one that &apos;s making the deals
and bringing up the numbers .
not paying his suppliers .
i &apos;d avoid business with this one , if i were you .
he owes me big .
i @-@ i don &apos;t --
don &apos;t play dumb with me , gid !
i know what you took from me .
you care to explain this ?
i @-@ i swear to you , i don &apos;t know what she &apos;s doing .
taking back what &apos;s mine .
this meeting is over .
i &apos;m being set up . jerry --
jerry , you -- you got to believe me .
you know , i hate to leave an unfinished drink , but ...
miles , i understand .
duty calls .
yeah , it &apos;s miles . yeah , i got something big .
all this time , why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
believe me , i wanted to .
every part of me wanted to , but ...
i had to protect you ,
and i think ...
that after everything i &apos;d done ,
part of me felt like i didn &apos;t deserve you .
but then i saw you today , and i recognized that pain .
after i was taken away ...
i went from
shuffling around foster care ...
to living on the streets ...
to juvie .
i was so alone .
and at a certain point , i --
i could only see one way out .
i know what you &apos;re feeling , charlotte .
but there is always another way to deal with this ,
a better way .
our father gave this to me .
it has --
the journals .
they gave me the strength to survive .
hopefully they &apos;ll do the same for you ,
and maybe you &apos;ll understand why i did the things that i did .
you spent three years fighting for a family
that was right in front of you .
and instead of embracing me , you used me and lied to me ?
charlotte --
do you hear yourself ? you chose revenge over me .
i didn &apos;t think i had the choice .
well , you did .
and you can &apos;t take it back .
you think you &apos;re gonna make
some big , emotional plea , hoping that i &apos;ll , what ,
forgive you for all the terrible things you &apos;ve done to me ?
over what &apos;s in this ? !
i came looking for you when my name was cleared .
someone had , uh , moved into your house .
where were you ?
well , i couldn &apos;t stand being there .
every room held a memory of conrad .
well , memories get fuzzy .
i never remember you ordering steak and eggs before .
a lot &apos;s changed , david .
how are you two over here ?
is everything okay with your order , hon ?
did you drop your steak knife ?
no , it &apos;s okay .
you got it ?
good .
you &apos;re still scared . even here , you don &apos;t trust me .
i haven &apos;t really given you a reason to .
i got a second chance ,
and all i &apos;ve done is accuse you of unspeakable things .
and i &apos;ve done some unspeakable things of my own .
david , what have you done ?
i killed conrad .
i saw his confession .
i heard the vile things he said to our daughter .
i couldn &apos;t let him keep on herting you .
and i knew he &apos;d drag you down with him .
i did it for you , victoria .
i ...
i would do anything for you .
anything .
thank you .
you know , when my father used to say goodbye to me ,
whether he was going to work or tucking me in ,
he would always say ,
&quot; know how much i love you ? &quot;
infinity times infinity .
used to say it every day . twice a day .
after a while , i &apos;d say it without thinking ,
without realizing what it really meant .
charlotte was right .
i chose revenge over her .
you didn &apos;t choose revenge , ems .
you chose your father .
but he &apos;s gone , nolan .
i did it all for a dead man .
he &apos;s never gonna know .
and charlotte ...
she &apos;ll never understand .
she &apos;ll never forgive me .
wake up .
you cannot control the way charlotte feels ,
just the same way you can &apos;t control how jack felt
when you told him .
and , i mean , look at you two now .
maybe stronger than you ever were .
charlotte will come around .
it &apos;s too late .
it &apos;s never too late .
she just ... charlotte needs time .
maybe a very long time , but ...
or not .
charlotte ?
i &apos;m speechless .
you do remember they have the internet in paris , right ?
the board is going to flip .
give it a rest .
you and daniel planned this whole thing .
what are you talking about ?
daniel told you about the redhead , didn &apos;t he ?
you killed her .
and i &apos;m gonna need a damn good reason
not to do the same to you and your partner .
daniel is not my partner .
whatever he did to you , he did on his own .
you &apos;re lying !
no . and i &apos;ll prove it .
yes , it &apos;s margaux lemarchal for jerry .
no , it &apos;s urgent . thanks .
jerry . i &apos;m so sorry , um ...
no , i assure you ,
everything that occurred was an act of sabotage
by daniel grayson .
i would hate for you to dismiss my brother
because of the actions of a disgruntled ex @-@ employee .
yes . i understand . thank you .
so , he has agreed to a second meeting ,
but he just boarded a plane to london
to meet with another company .
i &apos;ll get you on the first flight out in the morning .
no .
you &apos;ll get me out there tonight .
well , i need a drink . how about you ?
i wish i could .
i got to tuck carl in
and then i got to work on the stowaway because , uh ,
the wiring &apos;s a mess , and i can &apos;t open till its fixed .
is there anything i can give you a hand with ?
i mean , i don &apos;t know anything about electricity ,
but i &apos;ve taken my share of taser shots in training .
thanks , man , but you just , uh ... rest that shoulder .
speaking of , any word on your sister @-@ in @-@ law ?
i think she &apos;s gonna be okay .
thanks for grabbing her .
all in a day &apos;s work .
besides , it never hurts to look like a hero
in front of a beautiful woman .
emily ?
yeah .
yeah , she &apos;s ... she &apos;s interesting .
listen , emily is , uh ... she &apos;s gone through a lot .
she lost her fiance a few months back ,
so now is not the time to start anything .
see you tomorrow .
yeah .
thanks for coming .
thanks for asking me .
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re ready to ...
i can &apos;t do this with you .
i mean , i just ... i have so much i want to say ,
but i ... i can &apos;t without losing my temper .
so i wrote it down .
why do i have to fly commercial ?
what about our jet ?
not an option .
by the time it will be ready , you will be landing in heathrow .
now , the car service will take you directly to your meeting with jerry .
i would like to see daniel try and interrupt this one .
why are you doing this ?
i told you once the deal was done
i was gonna use it to take your job .
i &apos;m just doing what dad would do ...
putting the deal first .
we can fight out the rest when you return .
well , if that &apos;s the case ,
enjoy your final days in my office .
boarding pass , please ? passport ?
have a nice flight .
get that mutt away from me .
get it away . come on .
sir , i &apos;m gonna need to see your bag , if you don &apos;t mind .
i do mind . i got a flight to catch .
sir , has your bag been out of your possession at all
since arriving at the airport ?
no .
hey , hey . what are you doing ?
take it easy , man !
that &apos;s not mine .
you &apos;re under arrest .
that &apos;s not mine .
you have the right to remain silent .
it &apos;s not mine . hey .
anything you say can and will be used against you
in a court of law .
get off me , man . get off me !
you have the right to an attorney .
get off me !
if you cannot afford an attorney ,
one will be appointed to you .
do you understand these rights as i have read them to you ?
au revoir , mon frere .
you wouldn &apos;t believe what i just heard on the news .
gideon got arrested for trying to smuggle drugs on a plane .
that was an impressive move .
i had to act fast .
gideon confessed to killing that poor girl
and threatened to do the same to us .
so you got rid of him first .
i didn &apos;t have a choice .
with that article out , there &apos;s no way
my brother will be able to talk himself out of this .
gideon is going to prison .
although , for what he &apos;s done , he deserves much worse .
didn &apos;t think you had it in you .
you underestimate me .
and you misinterpreted that as a compliment .
still trying to protect my soul .
it &apos;s not evil inside us , daniel .
it &apos;s justice .
that &apos;s where our power comes from .
if we ignore it , we lose it .
i think it &apos;s time to embrace that power
and stop fighting our impulses .
where are we going now ?
i was , uh , hoping that i could finally meet my daughter .
i know it will be hard on her ,
but you &apos;ll be there to help her through it .
david .
there &apos;s something i need to tell you .
is it charlotte ? is she all right ?
when you asked me where i &apos;d been after i left grayson manor
the truth is that i was locked up against my will .
it was conrad ?
no . someone just as hateful .
because of her ,
my relationship with charlotte is in ruins .
my life is in shambles .
i cannot entertain a future with you
until she &apos;s been stopped .
i can help .
no , david . you &apos;ve already done enough .
tell me who it is .
her name is emily thorne .
goodbye , sis .
are you all right ? is anyone else in there ?
