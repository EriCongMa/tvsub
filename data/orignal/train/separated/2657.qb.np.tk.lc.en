yes , i want to marry you .
anything happened to me , this was to go to elizabeth ,
just so she &apos;d know .
you said the name masha rostova
had been lost to history until the manhunt .
now it &apos;s out there , and someone &apos;s looking for me ?
it &apos;s my mother !
i am asking you to help me .
walk away .
he came . how do you want me to handle it ?
i take it i &apos;m not actually being transferred to leavenworth .
ms. hitchin doesn &apos;t like loose ends .
you understand .
of course .
actually ...
... i helped put those protocols in place .
she wanted me to be sure to thank you
for your years of service .
i suppose a gold watch
would have been too much to hope for .
let me guess .
you blew a tire , stopped the transport to change it ,
and shot me as i tried to escape ?
close .
i pulled over to take a leak , you grabbed joe &apos;s gun ,
took you down after you shot him in the leg .
nobody &apos;s shooting me in the leg .
my bad .
you shot him in the head .
run .
you heard me .
run .
and who might you be ?

are you serious ? what about the rings
and the photographer ?
and the dress and the flowers and all that stuff .
we don &apos;t need it .
they had a cancelation at the church this afternoon .
i say we go for it .
hold on .
i thought we were gonna try to do things right this time .
doesn &apos;t this feel right ?
to do it now , today at st. cecilia &apos;s ,
where we wanted to do it the first time ?
it feels kind of crazy .
i mean , there &apos;s other dates available .
april 25th . i &apos;m due on the 22nd .
all right , so let &apos;s say we could get this done today ,
which i ...
i really don &apos;t know if we can .
it &apos;s not gonna be perfect .
but it will be a lot better than waiting a week or two
and having you roll me down the aisle .
if that &apos;s what it takes ,
i will roll you wherever you need to go .
but are you absolutely sure about this ?
come on . it &apos;s me and you .
we usually do like six impossible things before breakfast .
i love it when you misquote lewis carroll .
i know . that &apos;s why i do it .
what ?
wait until the wedding night .
72 hours ago , matias solomon escaped from custody
while being transferred to a holding facility .
how does that happen ?
the official story is he overpowered a guard ,
wrestled away his gun ,
and managed to kill the entire transport team
before vanishing like the proverbial will @-@ of @-@ the @-@ wisp .
and the unofficial story ? the cabal ?
apparently not ,
considering all of the dead men were assets of the cabal .
yesterday , solomon reached out to an associate of mine ...
a man with a very specialized field of expertise .
solomon was inquiring about the storage and transport
of tactical nuclear weapons ,
which would be troubling enough on its own ,
but coupled with the fact that your air force
is scheduled to transport just such a weapon
down the new jersey turnpike ,
i &apos;m afraid your wedding plans will have to wait , lizzy .
is that what this is really about ?
getting me to delay my wedding ?
this is about preventing matias solomon
from getting his hands on a nuclear weapon .
i &apos;ll take it to the task force .
i was hoping you &apos;d say that .
but i &apos;m not going to get involved .
what i am going to do is get married .
and i hope you can be there .
both of you .
thank you , elizabeth .
i just got off the phone with justice .
reddington was right about solomon .
he escaped from a transport vehicle three days ago .
he left a pile of bodies behind him .
why didn &apos;t we hear about this ?
looks like a covert cabal operation ,
an execution gone wrong .
and the nuke ?
ran into a brick wall with the office of secure transportation .
they refused to acknowledge
whether they had any weapons in transit .
the weapon mr. reddington was talking about
is the latest generation of so @-@ called &quot; gravity bombs . &quot;
it is completely maneuverable and has an adjustable yield ,
so you can choose whether to destroy a small city
or just a couple of blocks .
that &apos;s convenient .
did you get your information from beyoncé herself ?
uh , sorry .
playlist for the wedding reception .
which i really need to discuss with you .
um , about the wedding -- uh , it &apos;s this afternoon .
uh , i thought you and tom hadn &apos;t set a date .
which is what i came to talk to you about .
let me guess -- soon as you told reddington ,
he gave you the case .
yes .
which i &apos;m not taking , but i think that you should ,
even if it means you can &apos;t make it .
hang on . no , no , no , no .
i &apos;m not even done with the playlist .
i don &apos;t have your wedding gift .
i was gonna lose a few pounds to fit in my new slim @-@ fit suit ,
which is houndstooth , by the way ...
look , it &apos;s very small . just a few friends .
i would love it if you could be there ,
but preventing solomon from getting this weapon
is much more important
than coming to watch me remarry my ex @-@ husband .
i &apos;ve got a meeting with general baxter at the pentagon .
i &apos;ll find out if there &apos;s actually a threat here .
in the meantime , reach out to homeland
and nuclear security at the d.o.e.
see if solomon &apos;s on anyone &apos;s radar .
look , i meant what i said about you taking this case ,
but if you happen to be done in time ,
i would love it if you could perform the ceremony .
liz , i &apos;m flattered , but i &apos;m not qualified .
you can get ordained online . it takes like 10 minutes .
uh , look , there &apos;s a minister , but we don &apos;t know him ,
and i &apos;d just much rather you say a few words .
assuming i can get away , i &apos;d be honored .
great .
the service is at 4 : 00 .
no pressure .
this is everything ?
we load it in here , we &apos;re good to go .
all right , then .
let &apos;s go steal ourselves a nuclear warhead .
hey , you .
how we doing ?
good .
we got the rings , and i got a place to hold the ceremony .
you know , it turns out i am amazing
at impromptu wedding planning .
i had no idea . how you doing on your end ?
i picked up your suit from the cleaners ,
and i dropped it at the apartment .
and reddington , how &apos;d he take the news ?
today is not about him .
it &apos;s about you marrying a woman who is eight months pregnant .
you &apos;re right . we &apos;re screwed .
should i downgrade your bouquet of roses to daisies ?
i told you peonies . and don &apos;t forget the candles .
candles , peonies -- my first honey @-@ do list .
i &apos;ll , uh , call you in an hour .
let me be clear , harold .
i &apos;m not gonna confirm or deny any mission details
about the movements of our nuclear arsenal .
rolly , my ci is reliable .
if he says your convoy &apos;s gonna be hit on the jersey turnpike ,
it &apos;s gonna be hit .
duly noted .
if you were gonna ignore me ,
you could have had the courtesy to do it over the phone .
i had you come here
because i want to make it abundantly clear --
this is a military operation .
you and your team need to stand down .
general baxter , you have a problem .
i can help .
it &apos;s not a request , harold .
tell your people to stand down .
yeah , look , that &apos;s just not gonna happen .
no . it &apos;s not .
we can &apos;t protect the convoy directly ,
so let &apos;s focus on solomon .
he &apos;s burned with the cabal , so he &apos;s gonna need a team .
i can check with mossad .
see what mercs they &apos;re tracking in the area .
and have aram put together a list of equipment
they might need to pull this off .
liz .
yeah .
uh , playlist for the wedding .
it &apos;s definitely a work in progress , so ...
you heard cooper .
we got a lot of work to do , guys .
if there &apos;s any way that we can get there , we will .
we good ?
yeah . fine .
it &apos;s , uh , your big day .
this is about you and tom .
look , i know the two of you have --
it &apos;s not about him and me .
it &apos;s about him .
i mean , he laid a hand on you .
as far as i &apos;m concerned , there &apos;s no coming back from that .
i get where you &apos;re coming from ,
and i love you for saying it .
but i kept him prisoner in the hull of a ship
and tortured him for two months ,
so in my book we &apos;re even .
hey , i said my piece .
if i can be there for you today , i will .
mr. cooper , genius .
what ? what is it ?
no wonder he is the assistant director .
the way his mind works , his attention to detail ,
i can &apos;t believe he &apos;s living in his office .
i &apos;m sorry . what ?
did i just say that or think that ?
he &apos;s living in his office ?
no . i mean , not living living .
he &apos;s -- he &apos;s working living .
he &apos;s here all the time . point is , he was right .
uh , to handle a nuclear weapon ,
solomon and his men will need something
to shield themselves from the radiation .
the hunt valley nuclear research facility .
right outside of baltimore .
they were robbed an hour ago by a group of armed men
who took an isotope transfer cask .
all right , let &apos;s go .
you guys are a little late to the party .
we &apos;ve already got homeland , doe ,
and the fbi interviewing the staff ,
but i was told to help you with whatever you need .
we &apos;re part of a special task force .
yeah , you seem pretty special .
it must have been very traumatic this morning .
well , it wasn &apos;t fun .
about the worst we had before that
was a bunch of anti @-@ nuke yahoos climbing the fences
and spray @-@ painting the joint .
show them what we got .
that &apos;s definitely solomon .
yeah , he &apos;s the one .
said something about stealing a nuke .
the other , she was talking about payloads
and guidance systems .
let &apos;s see if aram can i.d. her .
look , if i give you a secure e @-@ mail ,
can you forward this footage ?
yeah , no problem .
爱你
i thought you said it was bad luck
to see each other before the wedding .
liz .
even worse luck to see me before the wedding .
i thought we had an agreement .
we &apos;re done . gina , what are you doing here ?
just doing a favor for a friend .
hello , jacob .
long time no see .
tell me you got something , aram .
what about the b @-@ 52s ?
the planes ?
the band . total crowd pleaser , right ?
&quot; rock lobster . &quot;
aram , please focus .
uh , yeah , right .
i &apos;ve i.d. &apos; d the woman in the video
as nez rowan .
sending you her info now .
she is ex @-@ navy ,
where she was a nuclear weapons specialist .
i guess we now know why she &apos;s on the team .
yeah , she also goes by about a half @-@ dozen other aliases .
been a freelancer for the past eight years .
do you have anything to trace her ?
actually , one of her preferred aliases -- harper waters --
is currently checked into a motel in baltimore .
all right , send us the details
and have a tac team meet us there .
desk clerk confirmed our target &apos;s in room five .
we were able to snake a camera through the air duct
from the adjoining room .
there &apos;s another door , opens to the parking lot outside .
i &apos;ve got a second team there .
all right , we &apos;re gonna breach from the hallway .
don &apos;t let her get out that other door .
navabi , you in place ?
affirmative .
two .
south corridor , clear .
command six , do you have eyes on the target ?
go , go , go !
we &apos;ve got a silver s.u.v. en route .
copy . en route .
move .
we have a runner .
move , move !
female suspect on the move .
team one , move up .
stop !
next one &apos;s in your head .
hands where i can see them now !
see , we &apos;ve got you on video at the hunt valley robbery .
we got a motel room filled with classified documents
and two wounded agents ,
one in critical care
who may never walk again .
the only thing you &apos;ve got going for you
at this point is that he &apos;s not dead .
i was unarmed .
oh , that doesn &apos;t matter .
you &apos;re an accessory .
and if your crew succeeds in its attempt
to hit that convoy and steal the nuclear device ,
you &apos;re gonna get a needle in your arm ,
just like your boss , mr. solomon .
the only reason i mentioned i was unarmed
was because it might factor into the deal
you &apos;re gonna offer .
you &apos;ve got nothing to bargain with .
i &apos;m a professional .
i pledge allegiance to the highest bidder .
i have no loyalty to mr. solomon
or anyone else beyond the terms of our business arrangement .
once they left me in that motel ,
our contract was null and void .
but if you make me an offer ,
i will tell you what you want to know .
no deal .
yes . deal .
full immunity . no jail time .
and witness protection .
solomon and his friends are very motivated
and very powerful .
and if their plan goes south ,
they &apos;ll know who talked
and they &apos;ll be very , very peeved .
before you throw me in the hole ,
tell the geniuses at the pentagon
we know the convoy on the turnpike is a decoy .
then let &apos;s see how fast they want to cut a deal .
you are a genuine anomaly .
the st. regis program
has consistently produced reliable operatives ,
except for you .
is there a question coming ?
where do you think we went wrong ?
when did you start to feel love for elizabeth keen ?
i don &apos;t know . i just know that it happened .
and i &apos;m really glad that it did .
even now ?
especially now .
you were my finest accomplishment .
and my biggest disappointment .
mine too .
get up .
get up .
turn around .
get on your knees .
goodbye , jacob .
was that your plan ?
&apos;cause a little sooner would &apos;ve been nice .
to tell you the truth , up until i pulled the trigger ,
i hadn &apos;t made up my mind yet .
well , have you made it up now ?
those last few weeks , when i thought you were dead ...
... i actually missed you .
but i meant what i said .
you &apos;re my greatest disappointment .
i &apos;ve acquired new intel regarding your convoy .
i thought i made myself abundantly clear on this issue .
we have a suspect in custody , a nuclear weapons specialist .
she claims the convoy on the turnpike is a decoy .
rolly ?
i &apos;m here .
listen to me .
we &apos;ve got to find out everything this woman knows , immediately .
look , she &apos;s asking for immunity .
i don &apos;t care . give it to her .
give her whatever she wants .
rolly , the truth .
is the nuke vulnerable ?
a minute ago , i would have said no .
i thought you &apos;d come around .
your deal is contingent upon your intel being valid .
start talking .
the real convoy is coming in on 95 at 1550 hours .
there &apos;s an abandoned van parked under the overpass
at mile marker 22 packed with a 1,500 @-@ pound anfo bomb .
they &apos;re gonna blow the bridge
right before the real convoy gets there ...
shutting down the traffic .
once the convoy &apos;s stopped , they &apos;re gonna hit it -- hard .
26 seasoned mercs with enough firepower to retake omaha beach .
hey , tell all your feeb buddies
to pack extra pairs of shorts !
they &apos;re gonna need them .
all right , i &apos;ve got a satellite view of the overpass ,
but if there is a van , we can &apos;t see it from the air .
who &apos;s on site ?
maryland state police
is coordinating with the office of special transport .
they &apos;re shutting down the 95 and rerouting the convoy .
explosive ordinance disposal is en route .
no , i &apos;ll take the call .
i got plenty of backup .
it &apos;ll make a huge difference to keen
if neither of us is at that wedding .
go . i &apos;ll be okay .
give her a hug for me , okay ?
yeah , i will .
be careful .
yes ?
what brings you here ?
you need an update on the solomon case ?
i just got off the phone with agent navabi .
she thoroughly briefed me on the situation .
then you &apos;re here for the wedding ?
no , lizzy .
i &apos;m here to ask you , to implore you ,
please , don &apos;t do this .
i &apos;m telling you , no matter what you believe ,
tom is not the man you think he is .
you &apos;re wrong .
you don &apos;t know him .
he &apos;s a criminal .
no . he &apos;s changed .
men like tom don &apos;t change .
you &apos;re attempting to build a life with a man
who is fundamentally dishonest .
no .
i am attempting to build a life with the father of my child .
a normal life with two parents who love one another .
with everything you know about me , can &apos;t you see that ?
can &apos;t you see how important that is to me ?
to my child ?
you were wrong about him once .
what makes you so sure you &apos;re not wrong this time ?
do you really want your child to pay the price
for that mistake for the rest of his or her life ?
get out .
i want you to go . please ?
i don &apos;t want you here .
♬ you came to me in peace ♬
♬ i gave you what you wanted ♬
♬ but no more than just enough ♬
♬ and now i &apos;m on my knees ♬
♬ have mercy on my soul ♬

i didn &apos;t expect to feel this nervous .
♬ let anyone that trust in me ♬
♬ be seen and be heard ♬
♬ and , lord , if i had known ♬
it &apos;s okay to be scared .
what you &apos;re doing ... it &apos;s a huge step .
what am i doing ?
you &apos;re trusting tom .
taking a leap of faith ,
one you know could end in disappointment ,
but it &apos;s because you love him .
thank you .
you are the closest thing i have to a real father .
i &apos;m also officially ordained as a minister
of the firstchurchoflifeandenergy.com.
and if this is what your heart is telling you to do , liz ,
that &apos;s all that matters .

i &apos;m so glad you &apos;re here .
♬ you do it all for someone you love ♬

come on . come on . we got to move .
commander , convoy &apos;s already been diverted .
what &apos;s our status ?
traffic &apos;s about to be shut down . the eod just pulled up .
all right , well , hurry it up .
get everybody back , set up a perimeter .
solomon and his team must be close .
raymond , we should turn around .
you &apos;re upset .
i &apos;m sure elizabeth didn &apos;t mean --
why didn &apos;t she escape with the others ?
who ?
the mercenary agents ressler and navabi
arrested at the motel .
she could have fled with solomon ,
escaped in the s.u.v. with the others .
agent navabi said she broke off on her own ,
tried to get away in a second vehicle .
hand me the phone , dembe . i need to see that vehicle .
♬ deep in my imagination ♬
♬ you &apos;re wild with wanting me , too ♬
tom .
♬ when are you coming over ♬
it &apos;s aram .
i mean , uh , agent mojtabai .

i recognize you from --
mug shot ?
uh , no .
uh , from your description .
thanks for coming .
whoa . quite a grip .
sor-- i was , uh ...
yeah , this car looks great , man .
i know . right ?
it &apos;s , uh ... it &apos;s my grandfather &apos;s .
♬ when will you ask me over ♬
♬ let me make your wishes come true ♬
going to be a pretty sweet getaway car , right ?
uh , not that you would know .
or ever , uh , like , uh , need one .
a getaway , y @-@ you know ?
aram .
yeah .
have you seen liz ?
ah , right . yes .
uh , she &apos;s inside .
thanks .
sure .
i &apos;ll just -- i &apos;ll leave the keys in the visor .
i told myself no more secrets .
and i promised you that i would be completely honest ,
no matter what .
today the major found me .
gina told him where to find me ,
and he came into our apartment and tried to kill me .
but he &apos;s dead .
and i , uh ...
you killed him ?
uh , no .
a @-@ actually , gina did , but that &apos;s a long story .
look , what i want you to know is that it happened
because i made it clear that i &apos;m out .
i &apos;m done with those people and that life .
but there are things that i did ,
and ... and ... and i might be done with those things ,
but i can &apos;t promise you that those things are done with me .
and i can &apos;t promise you
that it &apos;s not gonna happen ... tomorrow
or next week or ... or five years from now .
and i would understand , frankly ,
if you didn &apos;t want to deal with any of ...
stop .
it &apos;s me , remember ?
your ex @-@ wife who shot the attorney general
and was publicly branded a russian sleeper agent .
i know a little something about baggage .
but i love you .
and i am willing to help you carry yours
if you can help me carry mine .
not enough hazard pay in the world
to convince me to open those doors .
there wasn &apos;t anything inside .
you &apos;re sure ?
look , i know who you are ,
and if there was something to tell i &apos;d tell you ,
but there was nothing inside the car .
door &apos;s unlocked .
doesn &apos;t look rigged .
here we go . cracking it open .
what the ... ?
what is it ?
nothing . it &apos;s completely empty .
the van &apos;s completely empty .
something wrong , boys ?
maybe i &apos;m wrong . maybe the car means nothing .
maybe she was just unlucky .
why didn &apos;t it start ?
what do you mean ? starts just fine .
drove it up onto the flatbed myself .
she &apos;s a sacrifice .
solomon isn &apos;t after that weapon .
it &apos;s a distraction to keep us looking one way
while they go another .
he &apos;s after elizabeth .
listen , give me two two @-@ man teams going north and south .
all right ? thank you .
reddington , the suspect lied
about the location of the attack on the convoy .
there is no attack . there never was .
the target is agent keen .
you need to get to the church , donald .
what are you talking about ?
ever since elizabeth went public as masha rostova ,
still waters have been stirred up
and old grudges have surfaced .
and now someone out there
is singularly focused on coming for her .
coming to kill her ?
no .
to abduct her .
they &apos;re sending solomon .
in retrospect , that &apos;s a perfect choice .
he knows us intimately . he knows about the task force .
they gave us a false trail , and we followed the scent .
donald , if i &apos;m right and this was all an elaborate feint ,
all that matters is that you get to that church now .
on my way .
we are gathered here today
in celebration of elizabeth and tom .
in my years on this earth ,
i &apos;ve been blessed with some truly remarkable friendships .
and i &apos;ve come to believe
that friends are indeed the family we choose .
we are here today to witness the beginning of a new family ,
inspired by the love of a man and a woman who have found ,
in each other , their truest friend .
two people who choose each other .
now , each choice brings with it blessings as well as hardships .
choosing a partner means choosing that person &apos;s life
to become your life .
their joy becomes your joy , as do their burdens .
nobody gets in .
the sum of our choices are a weight
that each individual carries alone .
but as man and wife , as partners ,
you choose to shoulder that weight together .
and all of us here today ...
we celebrate the choice you &apos;ve made .
elizabeth , i &apos;m sorry , but we need to go .
what are you doing here ?
men are coming for you . we need to leave now .
solomon never intended to take that weapon .
he was contracted by an employer to take you .
they &apos;re here .
tom .
keep clear of the windows .
everybody , stay low .
aram , get these people out of here now .
stay down , stay down .
stay down , stay down .
i &apos;m sorry , lizzy .
you have a team in position ?
we have a perimeter .
agent ressler &apos;s en route .
in the meantime , we &apos;ll have to hold the fort .
the others ?
great . we &apos;re surrounded .
cooper .
yeah .
you know why i &apos;m here . send her out .
it &apos;s curious .
i thought you were the cabal &apos;s most loyal soldier .
and yet here you are ,
under the patronage of a new benefactor .
i was loyal to the cabal .
right up until they tried to kill me .
i &apos;m totally violating my non @-@ compete agreement , but ...
what the hell ?
so where do we go from here ?
i was instructed to deliver masha rostova to my employer
and that &apos;s what i intend to do .
send her out , and this can all be over .
so , this is your big plan --
an assault on a building
filled with armed fbi agents ?
honestly , matias , i expect better from you .
first of all , you and i both know
that you are outmanned and outgunned .
the plan was to grab her today , no matter where she was .
grocery store or house of god ,
it makes little difference to me .
and for the record ,
i take no offense that i wasn &apos;t invited .
came together rather nicely .
they went with ruby fringe tulips and pink peonies .
you &apos;d be impressed .
i &apos;ll tell you what , then .
i &apos;ll call you back in a couple of minutes .
give you some time to consider my offer .
and then i &apos;m coming in to check out the flowers myself .
your target is elizabeth keen .
she &apos;s to be taken alive and unharmed , but please ...
feel free to kill anybody else .
all right , don &apos;t worry .
my friends , they are the best at what they do .
there &apos;s no signal .
they &apos;re jamming it .
when solomon calls back , they &apos;ll have to stop .
you &apos;ll have a few seconds to get a message out .
reddington .
it &apos;s her , isn &apos;t it ?
solomon &apos;s employer . it &apos;s my mother .
who else would call me masha rostova ?
lizzy , your mother is dead .
then who is it ?
who ? you owe me this .
i &apos;ll tell you what i know as soon as i know you &apos;re safe .
we &apos;re not all out of options here .
nobody has to get hurt .
lizzy , you are not going out there
under any circumstances .
agreed .
you want me to ask those poor , terrified people
what they think ?
no .
hello , matias .
what &apos;s it gonna be ?
is she coming out , or am i coming in ?
i &apos;m coming out !
no .
there seems to be some disagreement on that score .
we &apos;ll need a little more time to sort this out .
you &apos;ve had all the time that you &apos;re gonna get .
brace yourselves . they &apos;re coming .
this is on you .
yes .
all of this , indeed , is on me .
your s.o.s. get through ?
let &apos;s hope so .
okay .
concentrate your fire up front .
drive them toward the back of the room .
they &apos;ll attack the front first .
try and drive us out the back .
most of his men will be there .
once you breach the front doors , it &apos;ll be quick .
pin them down , and we &apos;ll come in
through the back and put it to bed .
harold , we need to barricade that back door .
aram .
yeah .
give me a hand .
it &apos;s our only way out .
if we get out at all , it &apos;ll be through the front .
most importantly , you need to keep elizabeth out of sight .
no one &apos;s keeping me anywhere .
