you haven &apos;t taken down the christmas lights .
congratulations ! you &apos;ve found the world &apos;s thinnest argument .
i &apos;m finding the right moment .
that shouldn &apos;t be so hard now that you &apos;re dating .
&quot; honey , you &apos;re fired . but how about a quickie before i go to work ? &quot;
once you &apos;re inside , you don &apos;t have to knock anymore .
i &apos;ll get it .
hi , mr. heckles .
you &apos;re doing it again .
we &apos;re not doing anything . we &apos;re sitting and talking quietly .
i can hear you through the ceiling .
my cats can &apos;t sleep .
you don &apos;t even have cats .
i could have cats .
goodbye , mr. heckles .
we &apos;ll try to keep it down .
phoebe , do me a favor . try this on . i want to make sure it fits .
my first birthday present ! this is really
no , no , it &apos;s for ursula . i just figured size @-@ wise ....
sure . yeah . okay , it fits .
are you seeing her again ?
yep , lce capades .
this is serious . i &apos;ve never known you to pay for any kind of &quot; capade . &quot;
i don &apos;t know . i like her .
she &apos;s different . there &apos;s something about her
that you like . we get it . you like her . great !
phoebe , i asked you . you said it was okay .
maybe now it &apos;s not okay .
okay . maybe now i &apos;m not okay with it not being okay .
okay !
iknit , good woman , knit !
and that &apos;s the chrysler building right there .
nina !
mr. douglas . cool tie .
she &apos;s still here .
yes . yes , she is . didn &apos;t i memo you on this ?
after i let her go , i got a call from her psychiatrist , dr. flennan
dr. flennan dr. flynn .
and he informed me that she took the news rather badly .
in fact , he mentioned the word &quot; frenzy . &quot;
you &apos;re kidding ! she seems so
no . nina ? she &apos;s
if you asked her now ...
... she &apos;d have no recollection of being fired at all .
that &apos;s unbelievable .
and yet believable .
so i decided not to fire her again until she &apos;ll be no threat to anyone .
i guess you never know what &apos;s going on inside a person &apos;s head .
well , i guess that &apos;s why they call it psychology , sir .
the sound mom and dad will never forget .
for this , after all , is the miracle of birth .
lights , please . and that &apos;s having a baby .
next week is our final class .
susan , go deep .
it &apos;s just impossible .
what is , honey ?
what that woman did .
i am not doing that . it &apos;ll just have to stay in .
everything will be the same . it &apos;ll just stay in .
carol , honey , it &apos;ll be all right .
what do you know ?
no one &apos;s asking you , &quot; mind if we push this pot roast through your nostril ? &quot;
carol , sweetie . cleansing breath .
i know it &apos;s frightening . but big picture :
the birth part is just one day .
when it &apos;s over , we &apos;ll all be parents for the rest of our lives .
i mean , that &apos;s what this is all about , right ? ross ?
ross ?
i &apos;m gonna be a father .
this is news to you ?
i knew i was having a baby .
i just never realized the baby was having me .
you &apos;ll be great .
how can you say that ?
i can &apos;t even get marcel to stop eating the bathmat .
how will i raise a kid ?
some scientists are now saying ...
... that monkeys and babies are actually different .
you might want to look into it .
where you going ?
out .
with ... ?
yes .
can i just ask you one question ?
have you two , you know , like , you know ?
you know , yet ?
not that it &apos;s any of your business , but no , we haven &apos;t .
you meant sex , right ?
do you have a sec ?
sure . what &apos;s up ?
the past few days , people have been avoiding me and giving me weird looks .
well , maybe that &apos;s because they &apos;re jealous of us .
maybe . but that doesn &apos;t explain why they keep taking my scissors .
maybe that &apos;s because you &apos;re getting a big raise !
i am ?
sure . why not ?
oh , my god ! you &apos;re amazing !
you don &apos;t know .
helen , do the paperwork on miss bookbinder &apos;s raise .
you still want me to send her psychological profile to personnel ?
helen drinks .
will you marry me ?
so after the proposal , i kind of unraveled .
right . because you were really in control up until then .
i told her everything .
how &apos;d she take it ?
pretty well . except for the stapler thing .
a tip . if you &apos;re ever in a similar situation ...
... never , ever leave your hand on the desk .
okay , i think i get how to do this .
can we turn it off ? make them go away because i can &apos;t watch .
okay , they &apos;re gone .
are you all right ?
it &apos;s just this whole stupid ursula thing .
pheebs , can i ask ? so he &apos;s going out with her . is it really so terrible ?
yeah .
i &apos;m not saying she &apos;s evil or anything .
she &apos;s just always breaking my stuff .
when i was 8 , she threw my judy jetson thermos under the bus .
and then when i was 1.2 , she broke my collarbone .
she didn &apos;t mean to do it but i think it still counts .
and then there &apos;s randy brown , who was like
have you ever had a boyfriend who was your best friend ?
that &apos;s what he was for me .
and she kind of stole him away and then broke his heart .
then he wouldn &apos;t talk to me anymore .
he didn &apos;t want to be around anything that looked like either one of us .
i know joey &apos;s not my boyfriend or my thermos ...
... or anything , but
you won &apos;t lose him .
you gotta talk to joey .
lf he knew how you felt
but he &apos;s falling in love with her .
they &apos;ve been going out a week .
they haven &apos;t even slept together yet . that &apos;s not serious .
okay . okay .
may we help you ?
what are you doing ? it &apos;s freezing ! come inside .
no , you wanted me to take them down ...
... so i &apos;m taking them down , okay ?
rachel !
i &apos;m okay . i &apos;m okay .
mr. heckles ?

i &apos;m on this field , and they hike me the baby .
i &apos;ve gotta do something . the tampa bay defense is coming right at me !
tampa bay &apos;s got a terrible team .

... it is just me and the baby , so i &apos;m thinking they can take us .
and so i just heave it downfield !
what are you , crazy ? that &apos;s a baby !
he should take the sack ?
anyway , suddenly i &apos;m downfield .
and i realize i &apos;m the one who &apos;s supposed to catch him .
i know i &apos;m not gonna get there in time .
so i am running and running . that is when i woke up .
see ? i am so not ready to be a father .
you &apos;re gonna be fine .
you &apos;re one of the most caring , responsible men in north america .
you &apos;re gonna make a great dad .
yeah , you and the baby just need better blocking .
have you ever been to the rainbow room ? is it expensive ?
well , only if you order stuff .

you take your time .
there it is !

what can i do ?
i don &apos;t wanna screw it up with ursula .
and your friend ?
if she &apos;s my friend , she &apos;ll understand . wouldn &apos;t you ?

i wouldn &apos;t mind having a piece of this sun @-@ dried tomato business .
five years ago , if somebody had said , &quot; a tomato that &apos;s like a prune ... &quot;
... i &apos;d have said , &quot; get out ! &quot;
dad , before i was born , did you freak out ?
i &apos;m not freaking out ! i &apos;m saying , if someone had come to me
dad , i &apos;m talking about the whole baby thing .
did you ever get this sort of ...
... panicky , &quot; oh , my god , i &apos;m gonna be a father &quot; thing ?
no . we just had kids back then .
we didn &apos;t think about it . what else could the sun dry , i wonder ?
dad , come on . ikids .
look , your mother really did the work . i was busy with the business .
i wasn &apos;t around that much . is that what this is about ?
no , i was just wondering .
we can make up for that . we can do stuff together .
you always wanted to go to colonial williamsburg . let &apos;s do that .
thanks , dad , really . you know , i just ....
i just needed to know ...
... when did you start to feel like a father ?
well , i guess it must &apos;ve been the day after you were born .
we were in the hospital room , your mom was asleep ...
... and they brought you in and gave you to me .
you were this ugly little red thing .
all of a sudden you grabbed my finger with your fist ...
... and you squeezed it so tight .
and that &apos;s when i knew .
so you don &apos;t wanna go to williamsburg ?
we can go to williamsburg .
eat your fish .
rachel , the cute doctors are here !
okay , coming .
hi , come on in .
hi , jeffrey .
we brought wine .

how could we resist ?
that &apos;s great !
monica , how &apos;s the ankle ?
it &apos;s ....
why don &apos;t you tell them ? after all , it is your ankle .
it &apos;s feeling a lot better . thank you .
why don &apos;t you guys sit down , and we &apos;ll get you some glasses ?
okay . stat !
why don &apos;t we just tell them who we really are ? it &apos;ll be fine .
we &apos;ll get in trouble .
would you stop being such a wuss ?
a wuss ? excuse me for living in the real world .
so ?
so they still seem normal .
because they are .
when we go out with women from the hospital
relax . take a look around . there are no pagan altars .
no piles of bones in the corners . they &apos;re fine . go like this :
we &apos;re not going to do it . sometimes you can be such a baby !
i am not a baby .
be serious . every time
you act like a princess .
you know what ?
every day you are becoming more and more like your mother . excuse me .
here we go .
great place . how long have you lived here ?
i &apos;ve been here about six years .
and rachel moved in a few months ago .
see , i was supposed to get married , but i left the guy at the altar .
really ?
yeah .
yeah , i know it &apos;s pretty selfish , but hey , that &apos;s me !
try the hummus .
monica , what do you do ?
i am a chef at a restaurant uptown .
good for you .
yeah , it is .
mostly because i get to boss people around , which i just love to do .
this hummus is great .
god bless the chickpea .
oh , god ! i am so spoiled !
that &apos;s it .
i shoplift .
you had no idea that lipstick was in your pocket .
did i tell you that i think i &apos;m so much cuter than i am ?
and have i mentioned that back in high school i was a cow ?
i used to wet my bed .
i use my breasts to get people &apos;s attention .
we both do that !
monica and rachel &apos;s apartment .
just one second . rachel , it &apos;s your dad .
hi , dad . no , no , it &apos;s me .
listen , dad , i can &apos;t talk right now .
but there &apos;s something ....
there &apos;s something i &apos;ve been meaning to tell you .
excuse me .
remember back in freshman year ?
well , billy dreskin and i had sex on your bed .
daddy .
why ? why would i sleep with billy dreskin ?
his father tried to put you out of business ! you are dead !
hey , rachel ? are these your condoms ?
oh , no , that was just monica . she &apos;s drunk again .
i don &apos;t think &quot; scrunchy &quot; is a word .
why not , if &quot; crunchy &quot; is a word ?
then i &apos;m using that same argument for &quot; fligament . &quot;
ross , he &apos;s got the remote again .
good .
maybe he can switch it back .
maybe not .
okay , daddy ? that &apos;s the other line .
okay , no , not even in my bedroom .
okay . okay . bye @-@ bye .
hello ?
hold on a second . let me check and see if she &apos;s here .

what is that ?
&quot; tushy . &quot;
did you try calling her ?
for two days .
at the restaurant they said she was busy .
i can &apos;t believe she &apos;s blowing me off !

and i &apos;m gonna pay for this with a check .
your insurance will cover that .
i know . i &apos;m just not that bright either .

that &apos;s all right . and i don &apos;t think you were selfish .
oh , and i &apos;m sorry i said you were a cow .
that &apos;s okay , i was a cow .
i know . i &apos;m just sorry i said it .
worst case scenario : say you never feel like a father .
say your son never feels connected to you as one .
say all of his relationships are affected by this .
do you have a point ?
you know , you &apos;d think i would .
what &apos;s up with the simian ?
it &apos;s just a fur ball .
all right .
