okay , max , here are the paint chips for our new dessert bar .
don &apos;t eat them . this isn &apos;t your childhood .
these are all pink .
you want the walls of our bar to be all pink ?
it &apos;ll be the first time someone drinks
after they enter a vagina .
oh , hey ... no vagina in the dina .
or your apartment . ever .
you know , this isn &apos;t hooters .
the v @-@ bomb isn &apos;t usually batted around the workplace .
speaking of batting things around ,
our cat wants you to come over again .
yesterday you said your cat
was too cool to hang out with me .
so which is it ?
&apos;cause i am free tonight .
hey , everybody !
you know what today is ?
i hope it ain &apos;t the 15th ,
&apos;cause that means i missed dialysis .
no , i &apos;m 20 weeks preggers .
and it &apos;s time for oleg and i to choose the godparents .
you know , it &apos;s an old polish tradition .
like pierogies and public hangings .
godparents ?
god didn &apos;t even give me parents @-@ parents .
he just gave me some lady that took me home from the hospital
in a blockbuster video bag .
it &apos;s a big decision .
you have to pick a couple who would raise the child
with your beliefs and values .
and hugh hefner and whoever he &apos;s banging
already said no .
yeah , so i &apos;m making a list .
but oleg doesn &apos;t want anyone in prison .
you know , so that knocks out most of the women in my family .
you know , you guys could also have
these conversations at home .
but this counter is where they made the baby .
hey , earl .
oh , good , i need somebody strong .
uh , would you carry this over there ,
put some coffee in it ,
and bring it back to me ?
i &apos;ll hot this up in a second .
just let me hot this one up first .
what &apos;re you doing here ?
i know you don &apos;t like me to bother you during your free time ,
but i missed you .
and i want to tell you something in person .
well , whatever it is , i probably have it too .
and i probably had it first .
it &apos;s not that .
but now i &apos;m worried .
no , i met with this law firm in manhattan ,
and they want to make me a partner .
they &apos;re making you a partner ?
well , then they &apos;re gonna catch it too .
so , randy ,
you really are a lawyer ?
i thought you just played lawyers in gay porn .
thanks .
i will tell my trainer .
he was in gay porn .
hey , buzz lightyear ,
i &apos;m still waiting for that coffee .
all right , well , i &apos;ll be in my booth
working on my godparent list .
and whoever we pick should be like one of those
perfect families on tv like , well , the brady &apos;s ,
and the huxtables ...
《 我爱我家 》 的导演就是受此剧的启发而拍摄
or , you know what ? scratch that last one .
wow , if you &apos;re considering moving to new york ,
it must be a pretty good job .
well , there &apos;s a couple other reasons .
the bagels .
i have tickets to hamilton in seven years .
and there &apos;s this girl here i kind of like .
who is she ? i &apos;ll kill her .
so two of the partners want to take me out tomorrow night
to some fancy private dinner at someplace called beak .
you &apos;re going to beak ?
it &apos;s hidden away in a private apartment ,
practically under the williamsburg bridge ,
so you pretty much have to walk .
how awful and chic is that ?
i read in time out that that place is so exclusive ,
it &apos;s technically not even a restaurant .
big deal .
this diner gets called &quot; not a restaurant &quot; all the time .
hey , did they tell you to just bring max ,
or was it more of a &quot; bring whoever &quot; ?
i &apos;ll take that as a yes .
i &apos;d love to join you at beak tomorrow night .
how could i say no to beak ?
it &apos;s spring , so that &apos;s peak beak .
so you want to go ?
want to be my date ?
nah , pass .
fancy restaurants are one of the three things i don &apos;t do .
you know the other two .
didn &apos;t we blow past those week one ?
max , are you crazy ?
why , is one of my pupils getting all small ?
it happens now . i don &apos;t know why .
what was that out there ?
&quot; nah , pass . &quot;
randy &apos;s not just asking you to dinner @-@ dinner .
this isn &apos;t about food .
it &apos;s about your future together .
he &apos;s moving here for you .
you just &quot; naw pass &quot; -ed on randy .
weird , i didn &apos;t love your impression the first time ,
but i loved it the second .
randy &apos;s moving here for a job .
this dinner isn &apos;t about some law partners .
it &apos;s about you and him as partners .
do you hear words i don &apos;t ?
you &apos;re going to that dinner , young lady ,
end of discussion .
oh , that was so mom @-@ ish !
i wouldn &apos;t know . i &apos;ve never met one .
oh , good , this is it .
we knocked on another apartment door ,
but the only thing they were cooking was meth .
we walked across a bridge for this ?
this is basically my apartment ,
except our wild birds are alive .
randy , you made it .
and i mean , you made it because you &apos;re eating at beak .
i mean , the wait list here is longer
than an episode of hbo &apos;s vinyl .
max , this is marissa , one of the partners .
marissa , this is max .
she &apos;s my girlfriend .
max ? cute .
is that short for maxine ?
technically , it &apos;s long for &quot; meh . &quot;
sorry , i don &apos;t get it .
probably because of the klonopin i had to take
when that homeless man tried to talk to me on the way in .
uh , max , this is leila , another partner at the firm ,
and her wife , lei .
she &apos;s not just my wife .
she &apos;s also a star on instagram .
see ? i talk about your accomplishments .
i put wigs on statues
and then photograph them from behind .
that &apos;s it ?
that &apos;s it .
max ...
are you a lawyer too ?
uh , no , but i presided over a food court or two in my day .
max and her partner , caroline ,
are in the process of opening a dessert bar .
and i don &apos;t mean &quot; partner &quot; in the romantic sense .
i &apos;ve got that department covered .
well , welcome , randy and max .
you know , i &apos;ve been hoping to add another
straight couple to the law firm mix ,
but , you know , they &apos;re so hard to find nowadays .
lei and i met on an
orange is the new black message board .
it &apos;s kind of become the lesbian tinder .
uh , randy , wasn &apos;t there rumor of a third ?
oh , i keep pitching that ,
but he &quot; likes me too much . &quot;
again , don &apos;t quite get it .
little hazy .
well , i &apos;ll have to tell the chef he &apos;s preparing
oyster foam for six .
i &apos;m sorry , &quot; oyster foam &quot; ?
foam from an oyster ?
that sounds delicious .
i know your idea of fine dining
is a ham and cheese hot pocket ,
but i am really glad you came .
oh , here &apos;s lenin .
um , randy , max , this is lenin .
he &apos;s the chef . and my lover .
we have sex too .
lei and i are &quot; post sex . &quot;
all intimacy , no penetration .
i &apos;ll be serving a meal of seven bird @-@ themed courses ,
each one it &apos;s own unique flight of fancy .
not my words , a very giggly anderson cooper .
now , before we begin , do either of you
have any food allergies ?
just one , birds .
i don &apos;t get her , either .
let &apos;s all sit .
max .
why do you want me to sit that far from the table ?
that &apos;s me being polite .
you are in for such a treat .
lenin is a real artist .
he spends all day making these
teeny @-@ tiny , delicate little meals ,
which is why i pay our rent .
our first course is a french delicacy .
the ortolan bunting bird , roasted and eaten whole .
just grasp the bird by its head and start eating at the feet .
enjoy . obviously .
can &apos;t wait to get that bird foot in my mouth .
how &apos;s the baby pigeon and oyster foam , max ?
oh , delicious .
it &apos;s amazing how full babies can make you .
no , lei , way too many photos of me eating foam .
like a rabid dog .
oh , good . this is it .
the guy who opened the other apartment door
wasn &apos;t wearing pants .
or underwear .
or was circumcised .
hi ! i &apos;m here .
what did i miss ?
the point of literally every movie we see together .
marissa , this is caroline , max &apos;s business partner .
she texted she was coming .
she &apos;s usually not covered in this much sweat .
sorry , i had to run across the bridge ,
&apos;cause you need a credit card for one of those city bikes .
um , if i had a credit card ,
why would i be riding a damn bike ?
i &apos;m at beak . i &apos;m trendy again !
fifth course .
tiny poached noisy scrubbird with fiddle ferns
and fermented egg .
oh , that sounds so gross . i bet it &apos;s great .
max , eat .
i sure will .
when i used to watch tweety bird ,
all i could think was , &quot; god , that looks delicious . &quot;
you &apos;re doing great .
who wants some more wine ?
i &apos;m guessing max .
i can &apos;t believe we &apos;re here ,
eating the finest ... what &apos;d he say this was ?
blue jay ?
aren &apos;t you proud of me ?
i got through the first four courses .
that &apos;s more courses than i finished in high school .
oh , look at this pretentious ,
deliberately relaxed large napkin .
love it and hate it .
what is that ?
this first four courses !
i cheated , like in high school !
i couldn &apos;t eat it ; it &apos;s gross .
no , gross is when you hand the guy at del taco
65 cents and tell him to surprise you .
you are judging me for not eating most of my
saturday morning cartoon lineup ?
you want to chomp down on foghorn leghorn ?
when a great guy like randy is moving to new york for you ,
yes , you have to eat your childhood favorites !
anyone like to come see the de @-@ spining
of the tiny trumpeter bird ?
this could push me over a million followers .
i can &apos;t eat that , caroline .
and i have nowhere to put it .
my bra is at crazy capacity .
the fire marshal almost kicked out my left boob .
why can &apos;t you just try it ?
you &apos;ve had worse things in your mouth .
he &apos;s moving here to be with you .
he &apos;s moving here for a job .
look , whatever comes next ,
just put it in your mouth and eat it .
well , i did not know the bird was gonna be alive .
worst part ? making eye contact .
creamed kimchi
and pelican tongue with asian pear .
enjoy .
the least you can do is swallow a little tongue .
tongue swallowing ? foam ?
this isn &apos;t a restaurant ; it &apos;s a heroin overdose .
i love you .
good for you , max !
this is real growth .
is it bad i feel like the tongue is tasting me back ?
max , you look sweaty .
like when you try to do math .
i think that tongue is looking for an exit .
randy , we &apos;re really excited for you to come work with us .
how fast can you move to new york ?
not as fast as i have to get to that bathroom .
excuse us ,
we have to go to the little sparrow &apos;s room .
nope , it &apos;s cool , false alarm .
nope , real alarm . very real alarm .
should i come in with you ?
no !
even i don &apos;t want to go in there !
i doubt this door is soundproof , so talk loud .
just start with your normal volume ,
and then dial it down a notch .
oh , marissa !
you have to tell me
where you found these fabulous glasses .
restoration hardware ?
crate and barrel ?
restoration hardware modern ?
west elm ? cb2 ?
cb3 ? is there one of those yet ?
you know what ? let &apos;s get some music going !
like some really loud dubstep ,
&apos;cause i &apos;m running out of breath .
oh , there &apos;s no music allowed here .
it would get in the way of hearing
the symphony of taste .
not my words .
okay , they were my words .
i think i &apos;d like to make a toast .
oh , no , please don &apos;t make a toast .
i &apos;ve begun not to like you .
seriously , lenin .
not even a little light piano ?
you don &apos;t need to reinvent the freaking wheel here .
hey , caroline , please . just sit .
you know what , i see if i have another klonopin .
i &apos;m fine .
it &apos;s not for you .
caroline .
should i go in there ?
&apos;cause i am not hearing the standard
tinkle and a hand wash .
no , don &apos;t move . stay there .
that noise is just the pipes backing up a little .
well , a lot .
oh , lord !
they &apos;re young .
my camera needs to be in there .
enough with the camera !
i &apos;m alive !
max .
where are you going ?
anywhere but here !
max , seriously !
what &apos;s going on in there ?
everything &apos;s okay in here !
we &apos;ll be out in a minute .
if you &apos;re not gonna let me in , at least ...
max !
wait up !
you don &apos;t have to be embarrassed in front of me .
i &apos;ve seen worse .
okay , no i haven &apos;t .
just go away !
i can &apos;t take that sad look .
it &apos;s the same look you gave chestnut
that time he crapped on the couch .
i &apos;m fine alone ; you didn &apos;t have to leave .
no , i did .
they couldn &apos;t possibly think one person
was responsible for all that .
plus , i don &apos;t want to leave you .
you &apos;re sick .
i think it &apos;s beyond sick .
i lost bone mass in there .
my shoes are too big now .
i &apos;m so embarrassed !
hey , it happens .
you got a stomach ache .
you &apos;re just not used to rich food .
i &apos;m not used to rich anything .
and if this is randy &apos;s world ...
uh , bird bones and pretentious people ...
then maybe my body is telling me i can &apos;t take it .
max , if i got used to buying earrings at the ampm ,
you can get used to fancy food and pretentious people .
you don &apos;t get it !
he is moving here for me .
oh , do you think so ?
i wish your best friend
had been telling you that for two days .
he &apos;s moving his whole life .
i don &apos;t know how to do that .
i didn &apos;t even know how to react when he moved my chair for me .
you were right , it &apos;s not about the food ;
it &apos;s about our future ,
and i just vomited all over our future .
what ?
i hate to say this , but you need a mint .
sorry , i love you , but you need a mint .
i need to disappear .
what do you think of the name sheila newman ?
max !
randy .
great , just in time to see me jump .
what happened ? where &apos;d you go ?
oh , i jumped on that bike so fast ,
my man parts are no longer talking to me .
she didn &apos;t want to be sick in front of you .
you got sick ?
okay , fine , we all heard it .
but why did you leave without saying something ?
because words were the only thing
not coming out of my mouth .
max ?
you &apos;re not gonna look at me ?
i can &apos;t .
wait , here .
now she can .
you better get back there .
i don &apos;t want you to lose that job .
i don &apos;t want that job .
i don &apos;t know how many more pills marissa took ,
but she passed out in a pot of clam steam .
i missed clam steam ?
i &apos;ve been reading about his clam steam .
please stop saying &quot; clam steam . &quot;
i can actually smell the words .
okay , max .
you are starting to turn green again ,
so why don &apos;t you hop on , and i will ride you home
on my bicycle like a real man .
i don &apos;t know , randy .
a lot of stuff came up for me at that dinner .
and i &apos;m not just talking about
every single thing i ate this year .
i mean , maybe i &apos;m not right for you .
don &apos;t be so hard on yourself about tonight .
i mean , look at me .
i &apos;m not brave enough to eat in that diner .
come here , you .
maybe wait another 60 seconds .
i think we are different .
but we kind of go together .
like peppered baby bird bladder and pesto .
oh , no . oh , no .
oh , my god .
that &apos;s gonna do it !
wrong night to be driving a convertible .
oh , wait ... no , no , no , no , no , no .
so how &apos;s your first diner burger ?
it &apos;s not bad .
i &apos;m getting a little something .
um ... mesquite ?
yeah , they die in the fan
and then fall on the grill .
i &apos;ll take mosquito burger over pelican any day .
interesting , randy .
you get two waitresses paying attention to you
and most people get none .
like that one over there ,
over there , and that gentleman over there
who &apos;s just giving up and leaving .
fine , han , we will go over to the counter
and continue to talk .
i know i say a lot of stuff about you ,
especially to your face ,
but thank you for your help last night .
i know you would have done the same thing for me .
but if i ever get that sick ,
you have my permission to kill me .
i mean , when you went into that toilet , looking for my earring ,
i knew i had found my post @-@ sex partner .
you did that for her ?
and all this time , we &apos;ve been looking for
the perfect couple to be godparents ,
and they &apos;re right under our noses .
girl @-@ on @-@ girl godparents .
i like it .
you two girls are gonna be great with the baby .
i mean , caroline ,
you were elbow @-@ deep in max &apos;s upchuck .
i mean , i wouldn &apos;t even do that for my own father
when he swallowed all those bees .
wow , sophie , this is such a huge compliment .
tucked away in a terrible personal memory .
well , if something would ever happen to us ,
let max do the breast feeding .
&apos;cause , yeah , i don &apos;t want the kid to starve .
this is exciting !
randy , i &apos;m gonna be a godfather .
and equally as exciting ,
i &apos;m gonna be climbing out of that bathroom window
in about two minutes .
