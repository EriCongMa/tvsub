oh , please ...
please .
oh , please ...
please !
please ! no--
thank you .
ok , just put everything on the counter
and i &apos;ll put it away later .
i like your altar .
thank you .
yeah , there &apos;s still a lot to do
before the party next week , and ...
i &apos;m scared .
i &apos;ve never had the whole team here before .
why are you doing a day of the dead theme ?
well , uh , my stepfather &apos;s family
always made a big deal of it in mexico ,
and my name is penelope garcia , after all , so ...
hey , could you check my refrigerator
and see if i have enough hot sauce ?
you have some jalapeno sauce here next to this jar of eyeballs ,
but i think you &apos;re gonna need more ,
depending on which guacamole you plan on making .
you ok ?
you didn &apos;t even flinch .
jj &apos;s right .
i told her i wanted to go scary this halloween ,
and she just laughed at me
and she said that i don &apos;t have a scary side .
i &apos;m sorry . if it makes you feel any better ,
you probably do .
yeah . really ?
the building blocks of the human personality are complex , varied ,
and multi @-@ faceted .
it &apos;s essential to one &apos;s mental health
to want to express these hidden personalities ,
and it &apos;s a fact of nature that everybody has one .
everybody ? you have one ?
oh , absolutely . yeah .
ok . ok . i want to see it .
i want to see dr. spencer reid &apos;s hidden personality .
uh--you , uh-- right here ?
like right now you want to see it ?
i have fake blood running down my cheeks right here , right now .
ok .
once you see it , you can &apos;t unsee it .
ok .
i know what you &apos;re thinking .
you &apos;re thinking , did that guy just fire 5 shots ?
or did that guy just fire 6 shots ?
you &apos;re gonna have to ask yourself a question .
do you feel lucky , punk ?
that &apos;s clint eastwood , in &quot; dirty harry . &quot;
i mean , i know it &apos;s not as effective
as my dominant personality ...
he , look , we gotta go .
but i feel like there &apos;s--
these eyeballs , do they need to be refrigerated--
no . let &apos;s go .
oh , i recognize that face from somewhere .
it &apos;s good to have you back , hotch .
it &apos;s good to be back . thanks .
and under the heading of no rest for the weary ...
a woman was found dead yesterday near provo , utah ,
buried under a pile of rocks .
her face was smashed . her head was smashed .
pretty much everything smashed .
24 hours later she &apos;s still a jane doe ?
no personal items were found at the scene ,
and the severity of her injuries
made facial recognition impossible .
so provo missing persons has like zero intel on her .
well , it looks like the victim was tortured .
lacerations on both arms and a burn in the neck area .
it could be the killer &apos;s way of silencing her ,
literally and figuratively .
the robe she &apos;s in almost looks ceremonial .
yeah , the unsub must have changed her clothing .
could be a straight @-@ up woman hater .
took away her clothes , her voice , her identity .
and then covered her with rocks .
might be a concealment or an expression of remorse .
it looks like a makeshift tomb , if you ask me .
have there been similar killings in the area ?
none that we know .
i &apos;m impressed , hotch .
how &apos;d you get the brass to let us investigate
a single , isolated murder ?
i told them that the ritualistic nature
means that he &apos;s forensically sophisticated and organized
and he &apos;s likely killed before .
and likely will kill again .
which means we can &apos;t waste time . wheels up in 20 .
&quot; after all , what is every man but a horde of ghosts ...
oaks that were acorns that were oaks . &quot;
walter de la mare .
single victim , unidentified .
not much to go on .
let &apos;s start with the basics .
those rocks were heavy , so our killer &apos;s most likely male ,
probably in good physical shape .
there could be more than one unsub .
newsflash . we just got lucky with dental records .
our jane doe is gloria carlyle ,
24 @-@ year @-@ old grammar school teacher .
one red flag , and it &apos;s pretty scarlet , carmine , crimson .
she used to belong to a utopian @-@ style sect in town .
she joined it right out of high school .
used to belong ?
mm @-@ hmm . she left the sect 3 months ago
and she moved in with her boyfriend .
do we know the boyfriend &apos;s whereabouts ?
he &apos;s in alaska , so his alibi &apos;s as solid
as a pre @-@ globally @-@ warmed glacier .
garcia , is this sect run by a man named herbert sykes ?
wonder boy , yes , it is . how &apos;d you know that ?
5 years ago a teenage girl was found dead
on the grounds of his compound .
it was determined to be an honor killing of sorts .
the girl was stoned to death .
the rocks appear to be the cause of death
in gloria &apos;s murder as well .
the red flag just got redder .
all right , dave , you and blake find out what you can
about gloria carlyle from the medical examiner .
morgan and reid , go to the crime scene .
jj and i will talk to gloria &apos;s family
as well as have a chat with herbert sykes .
a couple of fossil hunters nosing around up here found her .
those the rocks ?
my men moved them off her body .
but that &apos;s all anyone &apos;s touched them .
these are sedimentary conglomerates with rounded clasts .
if you say so .
that means that geologically speaking ,
they don &apos;t belong up here .
the rest of this canyon is tertiary rhyolite volcanics ,
which means the unsub must have brought these rocks with him .
which would be noisy and time @-@ consuming .
so the unsub obviously felt comfortable enough up here
to take the time that he needed .
he &apos;s probably been here before .
sergeant , how wide was the radius of your initial search ?
we canvassed out about 200 yards in all directions .
we didn &apos;t find anything .
well , we may need to push that out a little further .
i was , uh , shocked
when i heard .
even though gloria chose to leave the community ,
her loss will be felt .
we spoke to gloria &apos;s parents a little while ago
and they said that you had had a fight with gloria
the day that she left the community .
this had something to do with your claim of divine heritage ?
i am the spiritual leader of my community .
as such , i often speak allegorically or in parables .
but gloria took the divine heritage business literally .
yes . she dug around in my family history looking for , uh ...
who knows what .
god , buddha ... zeus .
we were also told
that gloria was threatened by members of the community
when she announced her intention to leave .
i have no knowledge of that .
so the friends she made there weren &apos;t told to shun her ?
let &apos;s talk about the stoning death 5 years ago .
since you seem to know the answers to the questions you &apos;re asking ,
why don &apos;t you tell me ?
look , the guilty party was sent to prison ,
where he belongs .
what else do you want to know ?
reviewing the original case file ,
you were less than forthcoming
in the initial stages of the investigation .
you hired a public relations firm in the wake of the murder .
it took me years to build my community .
my investment was-- is substantial .
i was not going to watch it go under
because of one tragic incident .
i think we &apos;re done .
we may have some more questions ,
so please keep yourself available for the next few days .
the law firm of gordon , foxman , and mendelovich .
not local yokels-- wall street .
drag my name through the mud on this
like you did 5 years ago ,
and they &apos;ll be in touch .
mr. sykes , we &apos;re investigating a murder ,
and i don &apos;t speak in parables ,
so this should be very easy to understand .
if you interfere with us in any way ,
i will see to it that you are charged with and prosecuted
for obstruction of justice .
i &apos;ve seen some bad ones in my 15 years ,
but this was ... bad .
what was the c.o.d. ?
it &apos;s hard to pinpoint .
virtually every bone in her body was crushed
and every major organ ruptured .
my guess is skull fracture , but honestly ,
any one of these internal injuries might have killed her .
what about the lacerations ?
could they have been defensive wounds ?
no , they were in a distinct pattern .
quite deep and severe on the radius and ulna ,
but carefully placed so as not to cause death .
there would be substantial bleeding from a wound like that ?
absolutely .
yet there was minimal blood at the crime scene .
the victim suffered the lacerations and burning somewhere else
and was taken to the canyon to be killed .
but why not make it one @-@ stop shopping ?
transporting her alive , even a short distance ,
would increase the risk significantly .
the tox report did show traces of chlorpromazine in her system .
a tranquilizer . that &apos;s what he used to control her .
there &apos;s something else i wanted you to see .
fingernail polish was removed .
but crudely .
a mixture of citrus juice and vinegar .
and where that didn &apos;t do the trick ,
the polish was roughly scraped off with a sharp object .
not how i remember my ex @-@ wives removing their polish .
well , this was done to her , not by her .
what used to be up here ?
the dirt road leading in seems rather substantial .
salt mining . hauled this stuff out by the truckloads .
these hills filled a hell of a lot of salt shakers .
actually , less than 6 % of salt in the united states is used for food .
the vast majority of it goes for de @-@ icing roads and snow control .
guys .
over here .
you &apos;re right .
the killer &apos;s been here before .
and he seems to have a preference for blondes .
kylie , this one looks good .
i like it .
me , too .
i think we could find something in here for sure .
should we check it out , then ?
yeah .
ok .
let &apos;s go .
sorry , ma &apos;am . that &apos;s a reference book .
it can &apos;t leave the library .
not even for one night ?
no , ma &apos;am . but there is a photocopy machine on the main floor
if you want to make copies . 10 cents a page .
can we make copies ?
you know what , sweetie ? i gotta get ready for work .
but we &apos;ll come back tomorrow . thank you .
you promise ?
promise .
i hate when people can &apos;t be flexible .
i mean , who is it gonna hurt to take the book for one night ?
how much is this book ?
excuse me ?
to buy it . how much to buy the book ?
this is a library , sir , not a bookstore .
let &apos;s go , sweetie .
whoa , hold on , lady .
don &apos;t touch me .
i &apos;ll make the photocopies for you .
give me your phone number and we can set up a time to--
time to go , sweetie .
dave , are you and blake still at the m.e. &apos; s office ?
just leaving now .
yeah , stay put .
morgan and reid found another body
near the first crime scene .
22 @-@ year @-@ old abby stafford .
she was a student at the university of utah .
quick i.d.
yeah , her handbag was found near the body .
any idea when she died ?
morgan said the body &apos;s been there for a while .
her roommate says that she &apos;s been missing for a week .
the body &apos;s on its way to you now .
another rock burial ?
it appears she jumped or was thrown off of a cliff .
the autopsy &apos;s tomorrow ,
but the m.e. might be able to tell us something now .
ok , we &apos;ll stay put . by the way ,
have you had your audience yet with the dalai lama ?
yeah . he claims to know nothing about the gloria carlyle murder .
surprise , surprise .
what &apos;s your take , hotch ?
well , i think he &apos;s telling the truth .
you sound fairly certain .
yeah , money means more to sykes than ideology .
he took a big financial hit
after the stoning death a few years ago .
the last thing he wants is any more trouble .
protecting his brand .
utopia incorporated .
we &apos;ll check in when the new body gets here .
thanks .
i &apos;m sorry i grabbed you before .
leave me the hell alone
or i &apos;m gonna go back inside and call security .
it &apos;s not against the law to apologize .
it &apos;s called stalking .
and it is against the law .
stop following me .
you need to calm down .
i mean it .
if i see you again , i &apos;m calling the cops .
jj , were you able to contact abby stafford &apos;s family ?
no . they &apos;re vacationing somewhere in europe .
we &apos;re tracking them down . but i did talk to a friend of hers .
she said abby was a conservative , studious type .
no drama . no enemies .
i just got off the phone with rossi .
the m.e. says the new victim died roughly a week ago .
had the same laceration marks and throat burning ,
but the wounds weren &apos;t anywhere near
as severe as gloria carlyle &apos;s .
he was still warming to the task .
well , our unsub definitely has a type .
young , blond , pretty .
now , the elements in common
to both murders aren &apos;t giving us much .
let &apos;s concentrate on the deviations .
ok . well , um , abby was thrown off a cliff .
gloria was entombed .
the unsub left abby in her own clothes
but changed gloria into a robe .
the m.e. found another difference .
apparently gloria &apos;s fingernail polish
had been removed by the unsub .
abby stafford &apos;s hadn &apos;t been tampered with at all .
well , abby &apos;s death was quick and impersonal-- of the cliff .
no muss , no fuss .
but gloria was slowly crushed .
he took his time to make her suffer .
all the deviations in gloria &apos;s murder involve increased ritual .
it &apos;s got to be feeding a fantasy of some kind .
it explains why the torture was more intense with gloria .
the ritual fed the fantasy , the fantasy fed the rage .
if that &apos;s the case , this guy &apos;s evolving fast .
no ...
the hour is upon us .
with this , i send your soul back to hell .
no--
thanks .
same signature .
lacerations .
burned throat .
he &apos;s dressed in a robe .
but this is a huge change in both m.o. and victimology .
well , we knew the unsub probably wouldn &apos;t chance
going to the canyon again , but a downtown city park ?
it &apos;s a complete 180 .
garcia , what &apos;s the lowdown on parker mills ?
oh , you got the low part right .
do you remember in science class with the petri dishes
and the mold and the algae and the slime and the gunk ?
yeah , i appreciate the scientific perspective ,
but what are you saying ?
i &apos;m saying grade @-@ a pervert .
there is not a ladies underwear drawer
that this man did not want to dive face @-@ first in .
so i &apos;m guessing a rap sheet ?
as long as the telescope
he used to peer into the girls locker room .
if it is something scuzzy , parker mills has done it .
peeping tom , a stalker ,
non @-@ consensual frottage ,
which , btw , is rubbing your body
on , near , or against the vicinity of somebody else &apos;s--
let me call you back , garcia .
hey , check this out .
this burn was shallow and more distinct .
there &apos;s a pattern .
a design .
the victims weren &apos;t just being burned .
they &apos;re being branded .
so this guy &apos;s killing men now .
parker mills must have had a hidden or perceived connection
to the other victims .
or mills got in the way somehow and had to be killed
so the unsub could return to his preferred victim type .
then why bother with the cutting and throat burning ?
excuse me .
interesting .
what is it ?
tox report on abby stafford .
our conservative , studious girl had cocaine in her system
at the time of her death .
we &apos;re looking for a physically fit male
from his late 20s to mid 30s .
he &apos;s brazen , confident , and organized .
this person may be a moral vigilante .
abby stafford had drug issues .
gloria carlyle moved in with her boyfriend .
parker mills was a sexual deviate .
moral vigilantism typically has its roots
in repression and guilt .
this generally manifests itself
in low self @-@ esteem and self @-@ loathing .
by punishing others , the unsub may also be punishing himself .
he &apos;s also literally branding his victims .
we &apos;re not sure why , but he &apos;s likely marking them as his own .
his organizational skills suggest someone
who can get and keep a full @-@ time job .
but the work is likely low level .
his impaired social development
would not allow him to move very far in the professional world .
consequently , this is someone
most comfortable working in solitude ,
having minimal interaction with others .
and this makes it a challenge to determine
how and where this person is choosing his victims .
the two female victims were reserved and studious .
parker mills lived quietly
in the margins of conventional society .
so the killer may frequent or work in locations
that attracts this type of person .
uh , places of solitude , contemplation .
museums , gardens and parks , bookstores .
his choice of a city square rather than a remote canyon
means he &apos;s gaining confidence .
but the recklessness of killing in such a public space
suggests that this confidence may be stemming from a delusion .
he may believe he &apos;s in a place and time
that makes him invulnerable .
and if his delusion is gaining in strength ,
then his next killing may be riskier and more dramatic .
thank you .
i told dr. reid he could use my office .
there must be 30 books piled up on my desk .
well , that &apos;s either some light bedtime reading
or he &apos;s actually onto something .
you know , i was thinking about that branding thing .
maybe it &apos;s like that book we had to read in school ,
about the woman with the scarlet a.
no , that &apos;s unlikely .
the scarlet letter was a badge of shame
to be worn in public day after day .
our unsub is killing his victims immediately after the branding .
there &apos;s something strange going on here .
well , that may be the understatement of the week .
gloria &apos;s vision was extremely poor .
her driver &apos;s license specifies she had to wear
corrective lenses while operating a vehicle .
eyeglasses .
it says here she wore contact lenses .
no contact lenses were found on her body or at the crime scene .
the unsub must have taken them out ,
like he removed her nail polish .
but why would he do that ?
no wristwatch was found at the crime scene either .
nail polish , wristwatch , contact lenses .
what if he was trying to strip her of items
that reminded him of the modern era ?
it could be part of his delusion .
like changing her into a simple robe .
he needed to take gloria back to a primitive time
before he could kill her .
leland , there you are .
you need to get your new parking permit downstairs .
ok . as soon as my shift &apos;s over .
no , do it now .
you keep putting it off and today &apos;s the last day .
i &apos;ll watch your area until you get back .
guys , check this out .
what have you got ?
the pattern in the branding mark has design characteristics
similar to family crests from the late middle ages .
i found this encyclopedia of heraldry and look .
it &apos;s the seal of william stoughton , a magistrate .
check when and where he &apos;s a magistrate .
salem , massachusetts , 1692 .
stoughton was the lead prosecutor in the salem witch trials .
so this unsub believes he &apos;s hunting witches .
where is it ?
where &apos;s what ?
the book !
the book
that was right there .
where is it ?
it &apos;s been checked out .
what ?
a woman came in while you were gone ,
said you told her yesterday that it was a reference book
and couldn &apos;t be checked out .
this is a lending library .
remember ?
yeah , but--
don &apos;t worry .
i logged the book into the system and gave it to her .
our unsub chose the right role model .
stoughton was the most ruthless of all of the salem prosecutors .
our killer &apos;s also emulating the methods of execution
at the time of the trials .
witches were thrown off cliffs , hung , slowly crushed by rocks .
so the family crest thing , is that his way of honoring the guy ?
it &apos;s more than that .
he may believe he &apos;s a direct descendent of stoughton .
garcia , were you able to run
a history yet of the stoughton family tree ?
it isn &apos;t so much a tree
as it is a giant sequoia--
branches , twigs , roots , sticks , limbs ,
pine cones , woodpecker holes .
there are literally
thousands of stoughton &apos;s descendents out there .
are there any in the provo or salt lake city area ?
yeah , there &apos;s a handful ,
but none of them fit the unsub &apos;s profile .
can you send me the stoughtons &apos; ancestry chart ?
did you hear the part i said about the giant sequoia ?
i can send it to you , but unless your laptop screen
is the size of a drive @-@ in movie theater--
send it anyway . we &apos;ll print out a hard copy here .
i &apos;m going to send the side of the tree that migrated westward ,
and do not say i did not warn you .
you &apos;re going to need a bigger copy machine .
hon ...
baby ?
where are we ?
&quot; by the grace of the defenders of the faith ,
&quot; these two did engage in the detestable arts
called witchcraft and sorcery . &quot;
what ?
&quot; these sorceries were wickedly
and feloniously used against others . &quot;
what are you talking about ?
&quot; for such delving into witchcraft ...
witchcraft ?
is this statute made and provided . &quot;
no . no , this is crazy .
please , just let us go .
w @-@ wait .
don &apos;t hurt us . no , don &apos;t hurt us .
you &apos;re making a mistake .
don &apos;t .
no . no ! don &apos;t hurt us !
i &apos;ve learned to stop asking questions about this guy .
what &apos;s up , spence ?
there &apos;s something strange
about this one branch of the family tree .
garcia ?
talk to me . i am fluent in genius .
roy and bhecky danary , they died in 1985,
leaving behind a son named william danary ,
but there &apos;s no record of what happened to him .
the danarys were peace corps workers in ecuador .
they died in a car accident there .
and you &apos;re right , their kid just sort of vanished .
let me do some digging and i will call you back .
all right , well , we profiled the unsub as delusional .
what if stoughton being a great @-@ great @-@ great @-@ whatever
is just part of his delusion ?
or the discover of being a direct descendent
triggered the delusion .
he looked into his ancestry .
that would be easy to do here .
salt lake city has the largest family history library in the world .
gloria carlyle researched herbert sykes &apos; ancestry .
abby stafford was a bookish college student .
maybe that &apos;s where they crossed--at a library .
jj , have garcia get the names
of all the employees and volunteers
in the provo and salt lake city library system
and cross @-@ check those with descendents of william stoughton .
who are you ?
is that what this is about , the book ?
take it . i don &apos;t want it .
i &apos;m just making my daughter a costume for halloween .
that &apos;s all . we were just looking at the book for ideas .
do you confess your crimes ?
what crimes ?
what are you talking about ?
the court will be merciful if you confess .
i didn &apos;t do anything !
oh , baby .
listen to me . just let my daughter go .
she &apos;s innocent . just ...
let her go , and ...
and you and i , we could talk , ok ?
the indictment accuses both of you .
do you willingly confess to your crimes ?
or must a confession be extracted from you ?
you &apos;re crazy !
hey , i have a thing .
what is it , garcia ?
no library employees are direct descendents of william stoughton .
however , there &apos;s a volunteer with a fascinating family history there .
leland duncan , son of orland and clara duncan ,
mormon missionaries .
but the duncans aren &apos;t part of the stoughton lineage .
but , a big kiss to who can guess
where they were doing their missionary work in 1985 .
ecuador .
ding , ding , we have a winner .
same time and place
as the peace corps couple that died and left a son .
so the duncans adopted the boy and changed his name .
i &apos;m sending you a current photo of leland duncan
along with his home address . there .
thanks .
犹他州 普若佛市 彻蒙德路2384号 邮编84603
it &apos;s clear here .
clear .
ok . thanks .
apartment &apos;s empty , but leland &apos;s definitely our guy .
what are you doing ?
the court needs your confessions first .
wait ! stop ! no , i &apos;ll confess !
you don &apos;t have to do this .
i &apos;ll admit it .
i am a witch .
i &apos;ll call you back , garcia .
victim &apos;s charlotte novak . she &apos;s one of the librarians .
when was she last seen alive ?
around 3 : 30 . she came to the main circulation desk
to put a book into the system ,
then she went back to leland &apos;s section .
what was the book ?
&quot; an illustrated history of witchcraft and sorcery . &quot;
that was his lure .
and anyone who took the bait was guilty of being a witch .
where &apos;s the book ?
got checked out . yvonne carpenter .
all right , we need to find her address
and send units there immediately .
was it my daughter ?
your daughter ?
was she the one who betrayed me ?
your child is also a witch .
why would she help me ?
no . she &apos;s a witch hunter .
like you . she tried to remove the curses
i put on people .
you lie .
it &apos;s the truth .
i can prove it .
she has the mark of the angel .
it &apos;s on her hairline ,
just behind her left ear . look .
you see it , don &apos;t you ?
mark of the angel .
there &apos;s gotta be a secondary location somewhere .
i know , but garcia said that leland duncan &apos;s adoptive parents
never had an address in the area .
garcia .
talk to me .
what was clara duncan &apos;s maiden name ?
andrews . clara andrews .
did they ever live in the area ?
i &apos;m working on it . give me a sec .
yvonne carpenter and her daughter are both gone .
my officer said the apartment showed signs of a struggle .
your daughter has been released from custody .
when she wakes up , she is free to go .
thank god .
the court accepts the confession of witchcraft .
what ?
your sentence of execution will be carried out at sundown .
no !
you said you &apos;d show mercy !
please don &apos;t do this !
leland &apos;s adoptive mother , neither of her parents are still alive .
but get this-- they owned property
that is 2.8 miles from the canyon crime scene .
who lives there now ?
nobody . it was condemned by the county 8 years ago .
as far as i can tell , it &apos;s abandoned .
all right , send the coordinates to rossi , blake , and morgan .
sending it .
thanks .
it is time .
no ! no ! don &apos;t !
move aside !
let us pass !
guilty ! she &apos;s guilty !
wait . wait .
why is my daughter tied up ?
you said she was free to go .
this is--
you are a witch .
she is your daughter . it &apos;s in the blood .
no !
the court promised mercy and you shall have it .
you will be burned first .
burned ? no !
you &apos;ll be spared seeing your daughter suffer the flames .
no ! no !
she &apos;s a little girl .
she &apos;s never hurt anyone .
the accused have been convicted
of the horrible crime of witchcraft ...
no ... no ...
and found guilty .
sentence will now be carried out .
please ! please don &apos;t do this !
no ! don &apos;t do this !
leland duncan ! fbi !
set the torch down and lay flat on your stomach .
drop the torch now !
do it .
no . no , stay .
they &apos;re just phantoms ...
conjured by these witches to confuse you !
i &apos;m coming .
get me down ! get me down ...
it &apos;s ok , i &apos;ve got you .
you &apos;re gonna be ok . i &apos;ve got you .
kylie !
it &apos;s all right , baby .
my baby , wake up .
wake up .
mom ...
mommy ...
so i looked it up .
no witches were ever burned at the stake in salem .
really ?
death by fire was strictly a european thing .
moral of the story :
be selective where you practice your witchcraft .
what , what , what ?
i thought you couldn &apos;t come .
well , jack got a last @-@ minute sleep @-@ over invitation ,
so i hope it &apos;s ok .
yes , of course , of course .
and happy almost birthday . i will keep it on the dl .
thank you .
ok , everybody , i guess it &apos;s time to start .
here you go , sir .
thank you .
uh ... i want to thank everybody
for doing this with me ,
and our altar &apos;s burning ,
and i just feel so blessed to have you all here .
i will start . uh ...
this is my mom and dad .
i miss them .
and this is my cat simba
with his usual bowl of soda pop .
he &apos;s a weird cat .
ok . who &apos;s next ?
ok . well , uh , this is my sister roslyn .
ros .
she always dreamt that someday she &apos;d live in paree ,
so , um ... it didn &apos;t happen ,
but i thought this would bring her some happiness .
private first class darryl jenson .
we lost him during the tet offensive .
what are the tickets ?
opening day next season , wrigley ,
right behind the home dugout .
jenson was a diehard cubs fan .
sweet .
my mom .
she was the one who got me into crossword puzzles--
no erasing allowed--
which got me into linguistics .
you said we could bring more than one , right ?
oh , yes . this is a come one , come all altar .
it &apos;s nikola tesla .
i figured he &apos;s probably been inventing things on the other side ,
so hopefully he &apos;ll bring something to us .
i guess that &apos;s me . ok .
i brought ...
my pops .
he was a cigar aficionado , big time .
and , actually , rossi ,
he was also a huge cubbies fan ,
so i was thinking maybe he and private jenson over there ,
maybe they could go to the game together .
they can sort that out when they get here .
well , i guess this is proof positive
that ancestry ain &apos;t all bad .
how about a toast to the ... 30 or 40 of us ?
cheers .
cheers .
cheers . cheers .
salud .
