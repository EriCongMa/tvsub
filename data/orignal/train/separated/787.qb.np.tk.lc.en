ah , hop foo &apos;s , my favorite .
don &apos;t mind if i brunch .
are you eating takeout for breakfast ?
hey , you &apos;re my girlfriend now .
you &apos;re not supposed to judge anything i do .
say that again .
you &apos;re my girlfriend now .
i like it .
even when you have dumpling in your mouth .
sounds good .
i have to go . i have a big meeting
with principal foster today .
i hate that guy .
he always says no to your ideas .
no , no , no .
not this one . this one is , uh ,
ocean conservation day .
why do you do this to yourself , jess ?
so you &apos;re telling me to not even try ?
i just don &apos;t want you to be
disappointed when he says no .
look , maybe you should try
to try a little less .
how am i supposed to try to not try ?
that &apos;s a catch @-@ 22 .
oh , hey , coach .
oh , i dropped a dumpling !
that is his breakfast ?
yeah .
isn &apos;t it cute ?
he &apos;s not even ashamed of it .
i got it !
it almost got away from me ... aah !
look , principal foster , we have the chance
to do something really great .
everything &apos;s been donated .
all we need are transportation costs .
come on !
that &apos;s only the most expensive
part of doing anything !
you ... i &apos;m sorry .
that was rude .
i slept very badly last night .
had a chai tea very late .
had friends in from montreal .
some of these kids have lived in l.a. their entire lives
and they &apos;ve never even seen the ocean .
last week i asked them to draw
what they thought the ocean looked like .
i got a lot of stuff like this .
is that a bagel with wings ?
yes , sir , it is .
extraordinary .
i &apos;m afraid i &apos;m not taking no for an answer .
you &apos;re gonna have to take no for an answer
because that &apos;s just the way it is .
hmm , a shark with legs .
that &apos;s not even anatomically close to correct .
that &apos;s just a square , though .
have them start over .
that &apos;s just terrible .
nick ?
i want to talk to you about your fitness level .
of what ? my body ?
when &apos;s the last time you worked out ?
you know what ? i &apos;ll tell you
when the last time he worked out was .
it was the time that he battled his daddy &apos;s other dumb sperm
in order to make his way to his mama &apos;s dumb @-@ ass egg .
your burns are getting better , man .
just really long .
okay .
look , i don &apos;t need to work out .
i &apos;m old @-@ fashioned , coney island fat @-@ strong .
ah , nicholas . chinese food for breakfast .
see you &apos;re still a health nut .
aren &apos;t you supposed to be at work ?
i &apos;m rocking a pd-- personal day .
yeah , last day of the move .
coach , i see you &apos;ve wasted no time moving into my old room .
anyway , i just came over to , uh ,
drop off my old key .
wow , so this is like a moment .
looking to get some much @-@ needed space from this place .
you &apos;re right across the hall .
that &apos;s true .
everywhere you go ...
there you are .
what ?
what ?
his jeans are so small .
he looks like a little puppet .
like something some italian whittled .
come on , man , just let me train you .
you know what , nick ? you should do it .
i would love for coach to train me ,
but i kind of pushed it too hard
at the court yesterday .
went in for a dunk .
landed sort of funny .
typical winston .
that &apos;s true .
what is that supposed to mean ?
because you &apos;re always too injured to play .
remember when you sat out of the game because you were sad ?
i was also cold .
nick . let &apos;s do this .
look at me .
now , you &apos;re in a new relationship ,
which puts you at risk for gaining the boyfriend 15 .
that &apos;s not a thing .
it is a thing .
jess is into this .
i &apos;ve seen this happen a million times .
the boyfriend 15 quickly turns into the boyfriend 20 .
next thing you know , you &apos;re a fat dude on a little bike
with a cowboy hat on talking about , &quot; my ass hurts . &quot;
i don &apos;t want to be that .
i don &apos;t want you to be that .
i would just be riding around in circles
or would i be going places ?
circles , dude .
fat @-@ guy rash on your arm .
okay , look , schmidt &apos;s tried to get me to work out for years .
it didn &apos;t take .
also , and it &apos;s not an excuse ,
i have a very bad back .
your bad back ?
yeah .
you gave me a piggyback ride
two days ago and you giggled the whole time .
it was awesome .
it was also really funny .
that was pretty funny .
we took the stairs , dude .
yeah .
it &apos;s &apos; cause i was excited .
nick .
either take this dumpling and be a dumpling guy ,
or you train with me , and be a do @-@ ing guy .
it &apos;s hard because i &apos;ve been a dumpling guy my whole life ...
i know .
one day , that &apos;s all i need .
and i will change your life .
you &apos;ll be able to see your abs .
i thought god just didn &apos;t give me those .
come on .
let &apos;s do it .
my man !
i &apos;m in !
i &apos;m gonna warn you .
working out is not my thing .
not worried , man . i do not fail .
you know what ? i &apos;m in , too .
you &apos;re injured , you shouldn &apos;t , you shouldn &apos;t do it .
what ? come on , winny the bish
play through the pain , baby . you know what ?
let &apos;s warm up with some jumping jacks .
i was going ... oh !
miss day !
check out my cool beach hat .
unfortunately , um , i have some bad news .
uh , we &apos;re not gonna get to go on that field trip .
but you said anything is possible , miss day .
you just keep wearing that hat , crystal .
because as long as hot dogs are hats ...
anything is possible .
you could be the first little girl in space .
you just ride that hot dog hat all the way to the moon , girl .
oh , crystal , you &apos;re not legally allowed to touch me .
but thank you .
hey , guess who got a trainer .
so many menus .
i &apos;m gonna look like barry bonds .
seriously , what the hell ?
i take it , it didn &apos;t go well with foster .
it did not go well .
aw , jess .
i hate seeing you hurt like this .
are you serious ? more menus ?
this is like ...
why do we need more menus ?
don &apos;t we have enough menus ?
feels like you &apos;re saying menus a lot .
this is an eco @-@ disaster .
conservation deserves a win today .
hop foo &apos;s has killed its last tree .
jess , this feels like
a something @-@ else @-@ is @-@ going @-@ on type of thing .
are you okay to drive ? you got crazy eye !
uh , welcome to hop foo &apos;s . can i help you ?
this morning , there were nine menus just in my apartment .
i also hate those menus , they &apos;re so bad for the environment .
it &apos;s wasteful .
it &apos;s an eco @-@ disaster .
i &apos;ll talk to my boss , see if we can change that .
yeah , great , you do that .
i &apos;m gonna follow up with you on that .
i compost , recycle , but it &apos;s ...
i don &apos;t feel like it &apos;s enough .
thank you . geez , thank you so much
for stepping up and saying something .
that &apos;s who i am , that &apos;s just , you know , i &apos;m ...

that ain &apos;t real .
that &apos;s dumb .
that &apos;s straight dumb . you &apos;re dumb .
you &apos;re nice .
you excited for the holidays ?
i am .
anyway ...
my system is built to be easy . okay .
it &apos;s easy as peanuts .
easy as peanuts ?
yeah .
that &apos;s not an expression ; no one says that .
peanuts is an acronym . peanuts stands for :
physical education activity nuts !
like , like go nuts , have fun !
yeah , but you got to use every letter .
i &apos;m aware of that , but it still works .
what &apos;s going on , guys ?

i tell you , ain &apos;t no injury gonna hold
old winnie the bish down &apos; cause i &apos;m a warrior .

i just had a very productive conversation
with the owner of the restaurant .
action has been taken , change is in the air .
now i &apos;m going to go research lawsuits in my room for fun .
you okay ?
you seem a little off .
stop ordering from that place .
nick , put the dumpling down .
hey , what &apos;s up , jason street ?
the internet said that i had to stay off my feet ,
but then i found this wheelchair in a ditch ,
so i &apos;m ready to work out .
winston , go lay down . nick , put the dumpling down .

wait a minute .
ha , &quot; no msg . &quot;
where are you going ?
i &apos;m just taking winston for a walk .
where are you taking me ?
i think he needs some fresh air .
damn it , coach .
nick ! i want you to really think about your next step .
why do you care so much ?
this is a crucial moment , a crossroads .
by you eating that , you are telling me
that you &apos;d rather sit on the couch eating dumplings
than do something with your life .
now , are you a doer or a dumpling @-@ er ?
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m not you , man .
i &apos;m a dumpling @-@ er .
oh , it &apos;s veggie .
i did all that for nothing ?
i tried .
where are you taking me ?
what ? you &apos;re my smoking gun .
winston &apos;s in a wheelchair ?
what &apos;s next , roberto benigni coming through the halls ,
making everybody laugh ?
missing everything .
take these .
don &apos;t even talk .
my friend is having an allergic reaction to your food .
hey , man .
it says
&quot; no msg &quot; on the menu .
it also says it with the--
what do you call the circle with the diagonal line ?
it &apos;s the ghostbusters thing .
what ?
from the movie ghostbusters .
oh , it says it with words
and it says it with the ghostbusters thing .
all right , just calm down .
no , here &apos;s what &apos;s going to happen .
you &apos;re going to stop putting these menus everywhere ,
or i &apos;m going to show the people
in here what happens when you eat the food .
i actually like the food .
listen , jess , chinese food is msg .
america is living a lie ,
and we distribute menus so people order the food .
just accept that that &apos;s the way things are !
no , i am done accepting things the way they are ,
because there are menus everywhere ,
and there are kids who want to see the ocean .
what ?
and i don &apos;t like your vibe , dude .
this is what eating here did to my friend .
is that crispy noodles ?
coach .
* oh , no , no .
what the hell are you doing , man ?
i &apos;m making island beats .
i think this is what i &apos;m gonna do from now on ,
since , obviously , i can &apos;t coach .
i thought we were just messing around .
why are you taking this so hard ?
because , dude , i was trying to prove to myself
that i could still do this .
ever since malia broke up with me-- i don &apos;t know--
i &apos;ve just been a mess . feel like i can &apos;t do anything right .
guys , it &apos;s locked , it &apos;s unlocked .
get it together for real .
what are you doing here ?
i thought you said you were so busy .
i found this extra alarm clock ,
and , uh , i thought it &apos;d be neighborly ,
so i &apos;ll set it up for you guys .
you &apos;re welcome .
wait a second .
what is that ?
what &apos;s what ?
is that a camera ?
schmidt , are you spying on us ?
so ... it is ... it &apos;s a camera .
well , i &apos;m shocked .
schmidt , look , you decided to move out .
so move out .
i am out .
i &apos;m actually very busy , you know that ?
i &apos;m actually late
for a very important coffee with a ...
with a dear friend of mine .
who &apos;s that ?
who ?
yeah .
wouldn &apos;t you like to know ?
* tiny pants man
* he don &apos;t have friends
* that &apos;s why he got the clock
* he got the clock to watch his only friends
are you enjoying your meal ?
winston enjoyed his meal , right ?
until he had an allergic reaction .
let &apos;s go .
there . i drove away all of your customers ,
and i &apos;m gonna do that every day
until you stop with the menus .
earth warrior !
you win . i &apos;ll stop .
thank you .
charles ?
you &apos;re fired .
what ? no !
oh , my god ! oh , my god ! oh , my god !
oh , my god ! oh , my god ! oh , my god !
don &apos;t fire him .
he &apos;s the menu guy .
i was just trying to make a difference .
you did . at the beginning of the day , this guy had a job .
now he doesn &apos;t , so congrats on your victory . you win .
do you have any teaching experience ?
does anyone have an antihistamine ?
you know , i just moved across the hall ,
but it feels like i moved across an entire ocean .
people grow up , especially young people .
so my friends don &apos;t even miss me anymore ? uh @-@ huh .
well , they don &apos;t miss you .
they &apos;ve moved on .
what ?
well , how do you know that ?
because he told me .
his name is conner , and he went to suny binghamton .
i once lived with 40 birds ,
and they all flew away , and i moved on .
slow down on the noodles , buddy .
well , congratulations , miller . you were right .
what happened ?
i terrorized a restaurant .
i got a good man fired .
i might have ran over a lizard with my wheelchair ,
but i am ashamed of it .
so , that &apos;s what you get for trying .
let &apos;s see what the enemy tastes like .
it &apos;s good .
anybody want to help me use the bathroom ?
no . no .
okay , i &apos;ll work it out .
i shouldn &apos;t have even tried . you just get hurt .
this is such a relief .
i can get fat now .
hey , guys , stop it !
i want to eat this all day .
like a chinese food menage . oh !
okay , you guys are doers , and people like me ,
people who don &apos;t do anything--
we actually need people like you .
oh , boy , this is bad .
uh , this ... okay , all right .
i &apos;m gonna give you guys a speech ,
and it &apos;s gonna fire you guys up .
got some on my pants ...
first we &apos;re gonna start with compliments
to build up your confidence . okay , uh ,
coach , you &apos;re a great guy .
you &apos;ve got strong bodies .
what ?
you just need some more clients . i believe in you .
thanks .
jess , you &apos;re awesome .
you are the most resourceful ,
optimistic , amazing person
i &apos;ve ever met in my life .
i can &apos;t even get my kids on a field trip .
you can do anything you put your mind to &apos;
cause you &apos;re smart , okay ?
why can &apos;t you get &apos; em on this field trip ?
there &apos;s no way to get them to the beach .
that &apos;s a board . karate @-@ kick it !
you &apos;re not used to making speeches , are you ?
point of it is , is you never give up .
fine . i guess you win .
i sort of miss being here .
well , the nanny cam kind of gave it away .
well , nobody helped me ,
so now there is a real mess .
hey , winston ,
do you have some money where we could rent ,
like , a car or a bus or something ?
i found this wheelchair in a ditch .
is anyone gonna tell me anything that &apos;s going on ?
stop ! if it &apos;s not an idea about how to rent a car or a van ,
then i don &apos;t want to hear it !
wait a minute . nick ?
