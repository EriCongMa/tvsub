gossip girl here--
your one and only source into the scandalous lives
of manhattan &apos;s elite .
you were the one . i never wanna leave .
oh , my god !
i &apos;m sorry , but you lost the baby .
this is just the culmination of years of damage .
all right , so what do you wanna do ?
i wanna take &quot; gossip girl &quot; down for good .
i &apos;ll do anything . let him live .
i promise i &apos;ll keep my vow to marry louis .
chuck bass is asking for you .
blair , it &apos;s good to see you , and you , dan .
thank you , father smythe .
i swear to you , we are not having an affair .
then what the hell are you doing ?
he &apos;s having a relationship with me .
blair got in the wrong car that night .
this says the car that crashed was the one ordered for me .
你能帮我吗 -我们互助如何
x.o.x.o. gossip girl .
hey , upper east sider , it &apos;s me , gossip girl .
i &apos;m hoping you &apos;re interested in some quid pro quo ,
because we both have something to prove .
you look like hell .
i assume this means you didn &apos;t find anything .
i &apos;ve reread every piece in &quot; the spectator &quot;
since i started there ,
and unless christina aguilera
is mad about our
&quot; baby bump or mexican lunch ? &quot; article ,
i really don &apos;t think there &apos;s anything in here
worth hurting me over .
gossip girl didn &apos;t offer to help ?
yeah , but only if i help her ,
whatever that means .
sometimes to get your needs met ,
you need to choose an unsavory partner .
you know , that might work for you at 3 : 00 in the morning
in the lower east side , but it &apos;s gossip girl . okay ?
it &apos;s been pretty nice not having her record
our every move .
maybe for you , but without her ,
i have no idea what blair &apos;s up to .
you still don &apos;t know why she won &apos;t talk to you ?
before the accident , she was ready to run away with me ,
spend the rest of our lives together ,
and now ... she won &apos;t even take my call .
i have to know why .
so what &apos;s your next move ?
if she won &apos;t give me my answer , i &apos;ll find it myself .
now ... if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
blair should be wrapping up her breakfast with beatrice .
i have her doorman on retainer .
be careful . there &apos;s a fine line
between surveillance and stalking .
yeah , getting caught , which i don &apos;t plan on .
now if you wanna catch someone ,
you know what to do .
i hope you don &apos;t mind the imposition .
not at all . with louis at his bachelor party in monaco ,
it &apos;s a comfort to have a grimaldi by my side ,
and your kindness while i recuperated
is very much appreciated .
i wish it wasn &apos;t something so sad that brought us together .
but now we get to focus on happier things ,
like your wedding next week .
how can i help ?
well , you can get yourself to vera wang &apos;s
to try on your bridesmaid dress .
really ?
we all make mistakes ,
but i would be happy to
have you stand with me next saturday .
i feel so honored .
so hustle to vera &apos;s ,
because my bachelorette party is tonight ,
and you need to be free at 5 : 00 .
a real american bachelorette party ?
i &apos;ve only seen those in movies .
sorry to disappoint ,
but this won &apos;t be it @-@ girls gone wild .
serena has planned
an elegant and intimate party .
first , dinner at le charlot ,
and then off to the tiffany suite at st. regis
for kir royales
and kiki de montparnasse .
even without the male strippers and a penis cake ,
i cannot wait .
wonderful . now if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
i don &apos;t wanna be late for father smythe .
this fake relationship is costing me a lot of money .
i know that blair asked us to stay together
to keep louis from getting suspicious ,
but i mean , coffee in brooklyn
is half the price and tastes better .
well , haven &apos;t you learned
if you want the world to think you &apos;re doing something ,
you have to do it on madison avenue ?
and $ 8 cappuccinos are the price you pay .
what time do we have to be at &quot; the spectator &quot;
to launch your daily column ?
uh , we &apos;re actually doing it outside my office .
nate bought cab ads , and he thought it would be fun
for me to be photographed in one
just as my blog launches at 10 : 00 .
oh , that &apos;s pretty cool .
what did you end up writing about ?
about how my relationships suffered
under the microscope of &quot; gossip girl , &quot;
and--and now with her gone , how they &apos;re flourishing .
yeah , or fake flourishing .
and wow . taking down gossip girl--
that &apos;s a pretty risky move .
yeah , well , i wasn &apos;t sure
i wanted to take her on so directly ,
but then nate made a really good case ,
and now i can &apos;t imagine having written about anything else .
just so you know , you &apos;re kind of the focal point
of my first piece .
well , as long as it helps your career
and blair &apos;s future ,
i &apos;m on board ,
and the publicity from your column
certainly didn &apos;t hurt .
simon &amp; schuster moved up the meeting for my second book
to this afternoon .
see ? a second book and my--my column launching .
doesn &apos;t seem like fake anything to me .
forgive me , father , for i have sinned .
i ... pressed the &quot; close &quot; button on an elevator door
when i saw a woman running to catch it .
why did you do that ?
it was a long ride down to the lobby ,
and she was wearing too much perfume .
diddy called it &quot; unforgivable &quot; for a reason .
technically , that &apos;s not a sin , but okay .
what else , my child ?
my dreams at night ...
yes , my child ?
may not be about the man i &apos;m going to marry .
go on .
i love louis . i do , but ...
i fear the devil on my shoulder .
which devil is that ?
chuck bass , of course .
i know i need to honor my pact with god to protect him ,
but ... i &apos;m growing weak .
i &apos;m afraid i might break .
father smythe , you are the only one
you can keep me on the straight and narrow .
as long as monaco must have a royal priest ,
i want it to be you instead of that horrid cavalia .
cavalia isn &apos;t that bad , is he ?
while i &apos;m loath to discredit any man of the cloth ,
he &apos;s the biggest snake in christendom
since the one that bit eve .
to have you as my royal advisor
will mean that you can be with me at all times .
you &apos;ll find strength in prayer .
five &quot; hail marys &quot; and a &quot; glory be . &quot;
thank you , father .
today &apos;s &quot; spectator &quot; is ready to be uploaded ,
and the photographer &apos;s downstairs
to cover the debut of serena &apos;s column .
all right . just give me five minutes .
i need to do something first . thank you .
nathaniel .
hey , chuck . can you hear me ?
why do i hear church bells ?
blair was inside a church for a half an hour .
please tell me you didn &apos;t follow her inside .
of course not . i didn &apos;t wanna risk blowing my cover
or bursting into flames .
what &apos;s going on ?
well , i just sent it to you .
who is that ?
it &apos;s charlie rhodes &apos; ex , max .
the one who tried blackmailing her ?
yeah , and this photo was taken the night of the accident . right ?
he &apos;s leaving the empire with an envelope full of cash .
you think gossip girl knows more than she &apos;s saying ?
well , it wouldn &apos;t be the first time .
i &apos;ll have security pull footage from the night of the party ,
see if there &apos;s something we missed .
sounds good .
现在该你了
is it true blair plans to replace you
as soon as she &apos;s princess ?
it is , but it doesn &apos;t matter ,
because she &apos;s never going to become princess .
you will see to that .
yeah , i don &apos;t know if our plan is going to work .
blair &apos;s bachelorette party
seems like it &apos;s going to be
a very staid affair .
well , not if you &apos;re there .
and there will be liquor , no ?
see that she drinks a lot of it .
you &apos;re not going back on me now , are you ?
beatrice , blair is still in love with chuck .
she just confessed it to me .
if we don &apos;t stop your brother &apos;s marriage ,
i will lose my position in the royal court ,
and you will lose me as well .
is that really what you want ?
what do you want me to do ?
help louis to see the truth about blair .
get her drunk and alone with chuck bass .
then we will show the world where her true heart lies .
dad , lily , what are you guys doing here ?
serena asked us to come .
i &apos;m sorry . i was just so excited .
of course . it &apos;s not every day you get to see your face
on a taxicab .
serena , lily , over here .
oh , not yet . we &apos;re waiting for one of the cabs .
i wonder where nate is . it &apos;s almost 10 : 00 .
he would not miss this .
this is just as much his moment as it is mine .
i &apos;m sure he &apos;ll be out in a minute .
ah , there &apos;s one . taxi !
10 on the button .
this is fabulous .
hey , let &apos;s see that column .
i &apos;m on it . here you go .
serena , hold it up .
yeah , right next to your face . that &apos;s great . thanks .
nice . smile .
ask questions .
but there &apos;s n-- it &apos;s just blank .
serena ?
well , that &apos;s ... that &apos;s weird .
maybe there &apos;s a delay or something .
what &apos;s happening ?
everything okay ?
i hope so .
just put that up there in the corner
and make it color and see what i like .
&quot; this page no longer exists &quot; ?
i had to postpone the launch . i &apos;m sorry .
well , i &apos;m confused ,
because this whole column was your idea ,
so if you &apos;re rethinking it now , you need to let me know .
no , it &apos;s just not the right time .
marketing said awareness was too low .
so maybe after the cabs make a few more laps
around the city .
you swear that &apos;s what this is about--a marketing strategy ?
you &apos;ll be the first to know when i decide we &apos;re ready ,
i promise .
okay .
so you think i &apos;m ready for the pitch ?
&apos;cause i know some of my ideas
are a little on the esoteric side .
no , your-- no , your ideas are brilliant .
and obviously you light up every room that you walk into .
but ... i sense there &apos;s a &quot; but &quot; coming .
oh ... you may not like what i &apos;m gonna say .
it &apos;s a little ... personal .
is it my shirt ? it &apos;s my shirt , right ?
no . it &apos;s serena .
look , you &apos;re a brilliant writer with incredible creative range ,
but i worry the publicity you two are getting right now
is distracting people from your real talent .
see , i want simon &amp; schuster to see you
as the next jennifer egan or chad harbach .
美国当前炙手可热的新晋作家
and i worry that if they see you as serena &apos;s boyfriend again ...
they &apos;re--they &apos;re just gonna want me
to write a sequel to &quot; inside &quot; again .
i &apos;m sorry . i--you know , i know it &apos;s not my place to say anything .
no , but i &apos;m glad you did ,
because serena &apos;s about to launch this new column ,
uh , and the cover story is all about us ,
so i need to call her and tell her not to right now . hold on .
hello ?
listen , i got a question for you .
when your column launches ,
do you think you could leave out , uh , the--the parts
that focus on our present @-@ day relationship ?
why ? what &apos;s going on ?
well , my agent seems to think that
i &apos;ll have a better chance
of writing about something that isn &apos;t about the upper east side
if i &apos;m not so connected to you in the press , uh , right now .
i know--i know that sounds kinda bad .
yeah , it did . but don &apos;t worry about it .
my column has been put on hold indefinitely .
oh , good . oh , that &apos;s great . no , that &apos;s--that &apos;s ...
not good for you . i &apos;m sorry about that .
no , it &apos;s--it &apos;s fine .
look , if nate ever does decide to run it ,
i &apos;ll make sure all the references to you
are in the past .
yeah , we can keep up appearances for blair &apos;s sake .
i just think maybe no more madison avenue .
i &apos;m sure your wallet will be happy to hear that .
thank you , serena . i really appreciate it .
yeah . bye .
thanks for keeping me company .
told serena i wanted to hand @-@ pick the macarons for tonight .
besides , i wouldn &apos;t mind an orange blossom
to tide me over before dinner .
of course . i love laduree .
although ... i can go there anytime i like in paris .
you can never have too many macarons .
you joke , but you might want to
lick creme fraiche off a stripper or take a pole dancing class while you still can .
what &apos;s the point in deviating from the royal path ,
even for one night ?
my life is what it is . might as well get used to it now .
what are you doing here ?
and don &apos;t say shopping for velour track pants .
you &apos;re following me .
i &apos;m not going to leave until you tell me what changed ,
why you turned your back on me , on us .
i told you everything there is to say .
lurking in doorways won &apos;t help .
sooner or later , you &apos;re going to crack .
you always do .
whether it &apos;s at le charlot at 7 : 00
335
or the tiffany suite at the st. regis at 11 : 00 .
maybe it &apos;s a good idea to cut loose tonight after all ,
far away from any place chuck bass can find me .
absolutement . leave everything to me .
is nate in ?
uh , he &apos;s down in graphics ,
but he should be back up any second .
i just wanna talk to him about my column . i &apos;ll wait inside .
okay , well , maybe you should ...
turns out nate &apos;s gonna be longer than i thought--
hey , wait . what are you doing ?
nate killed my column
because gossip girl told him to .
you can &apos;t do that .
no ? watch me .
so , dan , what are you thinking for book number two ?
we &apos;re all ears .
um , you know , there are a couple worlds i &apos;m drawn to right now .
one of them is a modern western .
uh , but it &apos;s like a-- like a &quot; henry iv &quot;
kind of structure or vibe ,
so there &apos;s the falstaff thing ,
with all of your friends addicted to
the drunken revelry of the west , you know ,
so it &apos;s set on a cattle range during reconstruction .
smart , but i worry that , uh ,
westerns are a little played out .
how about something more modern ?
yes . he has another idea .
it &apos;s set in manhattan .
keep going .
yeah . um , it &apos;s basically , like , a hundred years from today .
it &apos;s the future ?
no , it &apos;s the near future .
yeah , i mean , i know it &apos;s a risk ...
can i hit &quot; pause &quot; ?
your fans are crying out for a sequel to &quot; inside , &quot;
and frankly , so is your publisher .
yeah , i mean , i don &apos;t know who &apos;s interested
in hearing that story anymore .
well , your girlfriend serena &apos;s article about you two
went up less than an hour ago ,
and there are already over a thousand comments .
um ... yeah . i mean , i was just--
i was really hoping to-- to stretch on this one .
then take a yoga class .
that &apos;s good .
but , uh , write what you know .
and keep on dating serena ,
at least until the next book comes out .
it &apos;s great press .
you wanted to see me ?
yeah . you &apos;re fired .
are you kidding ?
you went behind my back and launched your column
when i told you we weren &apos;t ready .
oh , we weren &apos;t , or gossip girl wasn &apos;t ?
i saw her e @-@ mail .
look , i know that you &apos;ve been secretly working with her
or for her . either way , i don &apos;t care .
it means you &apos;re not just a liar but a hypocrite .
did you even read the e @-@ mail gossip girl sent ?
which one ?
the last one , when she said my own cousin sabotaged my car .
trip ? you realize you &apos;re even crazier than gossip girl ?
well , her information seems pretty reliable .
she &apos;s got photos .
oh , yeah , because no gossip site has ever faked a photo before .
she would do anything to save her reputation right now .
nate , what &apos;s happened to you ?
when did you stop being able to tell the difference
between your friends and your enemies ?
serena , wait .
no , you fired me . i don &apos;t have to listen to you .
and you know what ?
honestly , someone should probably tell trip
that his own cousin is trying to frame him
for a crime he didn &apos;t commit .
okay , so we shall have plenty of alcohol
and many phallic party favors .
really , the most important thing is that we steer clear
of anyplace that chuck bass m--
chuck bass might find you ? i understand .
we &apos;re going to have so much fun .
i even got a few party games
i saw girls play on channel vh1 .
oddly ... it sounds perfect .
it will be a night you will never forget .
there was really no need to come up .
i told the front desk we &apos;re just fine with our gideons .
i &apos;m not here to sell you anything .
god &apos;s advice is free .
father cavalia of monaco .
the grimaldis &apos; spiritual flack .
what could you possibly want with me ?
i received a call from princess beatrice this morning .
she &apos;s concerned about her brother &apos;s pending marriage
to blair waldorf .
and you think i might be the answer to her prayers ?
perhaps .
i know that you &apos;re on your way to the st. regis
to interrupt ms. waldorf &apos;s bachelorette party ,
so i thought you would like to know
that the party &apos;s been moved .
what happened to &quot; thou shalt not steal &quot; ?
this is not the time to be cavalier , mr. bass .
the woman you love is about to marry another man--
i am quite aware ,
and thank you for your sympathies ,
but tell me , father , what is your angle ?
this is what is known as divine intervention ,
monsieur bass .
i &apos;d accept it if i were you .
i &apos;d have to speak with blair in private .
i &apos;m not sure even you could perform that miracle alone .
who said i &apos;m working alone ?
after all , i &apos;ve got a higher power by my side .
let &apos;s go .
i have never been so happy to be surrounded
by so many bridge and tunnel types .
you should have worn an actual tiara .
are you kidding ?
someone would have fist @-@ pumped it off her head .
ooh . shots now .
so ... who &apos;s ready for the first party game ?
i am .
beatrice came up with a great plan--
match the ex with the act .
remember how we made you write down
all the secret , scandalous acts your exes committed ?
well , beatrice now holds the questions and the answers
and will read each one aloud .
if no one can name the right ex ...
we all take a shot ,
but if we guess correctly , you take a shot .
well , i hope you ladies have the urge to purge ,
because those secrets not even serena knows .
wait . where is serena ?
oh , my god . i forgot to call her
with the change in plans .
oh , let me call her now .
hey , b. i &apos;m on my way .
no , no , no , there &apos;s a change in location .
we &apos;re at panchito &apos;s .
i &apos;m sorry . my phone must be messed up .
i thought you said you were at panchito &apos;s .
yeah , beatrice forgot to call and tell you .
beatrice doesn &apos;t seem like the kind of girl
who forgets anything .
she &apos;s changed . i promise .
but what are we doing even talking about this ?
get in a cab immediately .
no , i &apos;m still at the apartment .
i have to finish something ,
but , um , i &apos;ll be there soon .
i promise , and please don &apos;t drink
too many frozen margaritas before i get there . bye .
everybody &apos;s waiting . let &apos;s start drinking .
hey , trip , i &apos;m glad you decided to come .
well , thanks for calling .
i saw your fight with nate on &quot; gossip girl . &quot;
i know you have no reason to take my side in anything ,
but i really appreciate you standing up for me in this .
i &apos;m not doing this for you .
i &apos;m doing it because it &apos;s the right thing .
i @-@ i just--i don &apos;t know what nate was thinking .
next question-- &quot; what is lord marcus &apos; favorite song ? &quot;
ooh , ooh , i know . &quot; where do broken hearts go ? &quot;
how did you know that ?
lucky guess !
there have been a lot of lucky guesses tonight .
okay . question number four--
&quot; who once wore blair &apos;s underwear
to dinner at picholine ? &quot;
oh , oh , oh . bottoms up , ladies .
no one knows the answer to that one .
i never told a single soul about that .
i don &apos;t think i even wrote it in my diary .
carter baizen .
correct . blair drinks .
this game is kicking my ass .
drink , drink , drink , drink .
no !
oh , get it !
what &apos;s so funny ?
serena &apos;s column .
i gotta hand it to her . it &apos;s great .
and i &apos;m not the only one that thinks so .
yeah , i know .
the whole city &apos;s reading it .
over a thousand comments .
is that a bad thing ?
well , for me , kind of .
i had my , uh , my pitch meeting this afternoon with my editor ,
and now that serena and i are--are back on ,
he &apos;s completely focused on me writing a sequel to &quot; inside . &quot;
that &apos;s great . you guys are the new hot couple .
you should enjoy it .
but we &apos;re not dating .
we &apos;re just faking it to protect blair &apos;s engagement .
okay . i &apos;m not even gonna ask you to fill me in .
instead , i &apos;m just gonna assume
there &apos;s a long royal explanation .
you know me well , and blair , but the point is
as long as it seems like serena and i are together ,
my editor &apos;s not gonna let me write a second novel
i &apos;d actually care about .
well , sacrificing your career for the people you love ,
i understand .
but sacrificing it for fake love , i ...
i think it &apos;s counterintuitive .
yeah , which is why i have to find serena .
have you seen her ?
tonight &apos;s blair &apos;s bachelorette party .
i &apos;m sure she &apos;s there .
well , i &apos;ve already crashed her bridal shower .
i &apos;m sure it won &apos;t matter if i barge in
on another pre @-@ wedding event .
oh , tell serena i &apos;m a fan .
now since i &apos;m ... not sober ...
i &apos;m gonna tell you what i really think about tonight .
i &apos;m having the best time .
ohh , i &apos;m so glad .
but i had my doubts about you .
you are almost as scheme @-@ y as me .
but we are cut from the same cloth--
overbearing mother , absent father ,
the weight of a thousand expectations .
you &apos;re right .
i always am .
can i ask you a question ?
anything .
why are you marrying my brother
when i know you &apos;re not in love with him ?
i do love him .
there might be some loves that seem ...
bigger than others or more complicated or ...
harder to let go of .
but there &apos;s a reason they &apos;re not meant to be .
you cannot choose who you love .
but you can choose how you love them .
and there are some people you can only love
by not being with them .
okay , i &apos;ll get you some water .
you need to sober up .
oh , you &apos;re so nice ... and so pretty .
i don &apos;t understand .
how could nate ever believe i &apos;d wanna hurt him ?
he &apos;s the closest thing i have to a brother .
no , i know , but you know ,
nate &apos;s not the kid that you grew up with .
he &apos;s changed .
yeah . well , so have i.
and i &apos;m not gonna sit here and let him try to frame me
for a crime i didn &apos;t commit .
well , then we need to kill the story
before he goes public with it .
how ? there &apos;s no way i can prove i didn &apos;t do it .
i know , but maybe we can find out who really did do it .
i mean , come on . is there anyone that you can think of
that would wanna hurt nate ?
i don &apos;t even wanna say this out loud , serena .
but all the way here , i was replaying it in my mind .
replaying what ?
the night of the accident .
i heard maureen call a car to take her to the empire .
if i had known--
wait , wait . maureen ?
are you surprised ?
i mean , after all , all she &apos;s ever cared about
was my career , how my success reflected on her .
when she saw grandfather pass me over for nate ,
she decided to protect the thing that mattered to her most .
i think we &apos;ve heard enough .
thank you , nate .
oh , don &apos;t thank me . thank serena .
it was her idea .
what the hell &apos;s going on ?
well , we knew you wouldn &apos;t admit to anything ,
so serena and i staged that little argument
on &quot; gossip girl . &quot;
we figured you &apos;d try to pin the accident on someone else
just like you did two years ago
when you left serena in that car .
did you really think i &apos;d talk to you again ,
never mind take your side against nate &apos;s ?
you &apos;re really gonna try to pin this on maureen ?
oh , i &apos;m not pinning anything . it was maureen .
why don &apos;t we go ask her ourselves ?
we don &apos;t have to . she has an airtight alibi .
how do you know ?
because on the night of the accident ,
she was with me , consulting with a divorce lawyer .
and as soon as she hears about this ,
she &apos;s definitely gonna be through with you .
i have to say , an unexpected choice .
i &apos;ll get blair .
why don &apos;t you wait in the car ?
i certainly hope you know what you &apos;re doing .
a priest in a bar ? kinky .
you have no idea .
let &apos;s go this way . now tell beatrice i need air .
i &apos;ll be back in a minute .
hey , bridey , got a match ?
two . and that &apos;s the problem .
all right , well , hold this while i go find one .
ooh . don &apos;t mind if i do .
ooh , the strippers are here !
excuse me , miss .
is that a joint in your mouth ?
well , hello , officer ... weiner .
why , yes , it is . do you want some ?
okay .
oh , you &apos;re no fun . where did beatrice find you ?
no , shh .
just cut all small talk .
let &apos;s find out if you really are new york &apos;s finest--
oh ! is that a real gun ?
okay .
ow ! what are you doing ?
is this part of the act ?
hey , excuse me , officers , we--
back off , kid .
okay .
no . no , no , no .
d @-@ don &apos;t you know who i am ?
i &apos;m going to be the princess of monaco !
yeah ? and i &apos;m the king of the 6th precinct .
i love you , new york !
of course you &apos;d be behind this .
hey , where &apos;s blair ?
i &apos;m just finishing the paperwork .
you royal bitch ! you paid that girl to give me a joint
and tipped off the police that i was outside with it
because you wanted to humiliate me
in the eyes of the world .
what &apos;s next ? photoshopped nude pics ?
a dead body in my bed ?
ooh , hey , she &apos;s-- she &apos;s just making a point .
blair , this was not beatrice &apos;s fault .
it was chuck &apos;s .
chuck &apos;s ?
i shook his tail with a decoy plan .
he &apos;s staking out a suite at the st. regis as we speak .
no , i saw him there with my own eyes .
ma belle @-@ soeur , may we speak privately ?
go ahead . i &apos;ll wait for your things .
how you doing ?
start at the beginning .
and don &apos;t leave anything out .
the day of the accident , i met max .
he followed you from nate &apos;s office
and offered to help me in exchange for money .
we &apos;d just had that argument about the weekend ,
nate taking my place .
i was so angry , and so i paid him to drain
the brake fluid from the car--
half before and the rest when it was done .
so that explains gossip girl &apos;s photo of max at the empire .
i met him outside the garage to give him the rest of the money .
he said he &apos;d done it , and he took off ,
but when i double @-@ checked , it turns out that he played me .
he took the money , and he ran .
so you did it yourself .
look , i never meant for anything to happen to blair .
yeah , but you wouldn &apos;t have cared
if i ended up in a wheelchair or worse ?
i never thought it would get that bad .
i thought you &apos;d--i don &apos;t know-- hit a parked car ,
get thrown around , get banged up .
i wanted to ruin your weekend , not your life .
and i know what you think of me after what i did to serena .
but when i saw you rising up at &quot; the spectator ... &quot;
well , we both know there &apos;s only a certain amount
of grandfather &apos;s love to go around .
he chose you .
and so i did the only thing i knew how to .
that &apos;s it ? that &apos;s your answer ? what , not enough love ?
i raised you to stand on your own two feet .
no . you raised me to kneel before yours .
and now my life is over .
and that &apos;s exactly what you deserve .
two years ago , you and i were the ones in the accident ,
and you left me hurt and alone ,
and you got off scot @-@ free .
but that &apos;s not what &apos;s gonna happen this time .
this time , you are gonna pay for what you did .
and i &apos;m gonna see to it .
oh , blair &apos;s been arrested .
go . we &apos;ve got it covered .
so you &apos;re telling me that when my face
is on &quot; page six &quot; tomorrow ,
i have nobody to blame but myself ?
yes , but don &apos;t be so sure about the story getting out .
where did you get those ?
i bought them off everyone outside the bar .
did you get all of them ?
if anyone talks , it &apos;ll be just a rumor .
no proof .
oh , i &apos;ve never been so happy
for the demise of &quot; gossip girl . &quot;
but now ... one last thing .
voila .
trip &apos;s in the car . says he wants to tell the police himself .
i &apos;m gonna take him down there now .
good .
i wanna thank you , nathaniel ,
for the way you handled things tonight ,
and for never believing that i could have had anything to do
with this heinous crime .
well , i &apos;m glad your conscience is clear .
wh @-@ what is that supposed to mean ?
you can &apos;t possibly blame me for what happened .
you &apos;ve pitted us against each other our entire lives .
everything is a competition , and the prize is your approval .
it &apos;s the great van der bilt tradition .
well , i &apos;m sorry that you feel that way about your own family .
and might i remind you that diana payne
would never have given you that job at &quot; the spectator &quot;
if i hadn &apos;t paid her to ?
you really think you can make it on your own ?
i don &apos;t know .
but it &apos;s the only way it &apos;ll mean anything .
i &apos;ve set up some meetings with investors .
i &apos;ll be making you an offer .
hey , where is she ? what happened ?
oh , she &apos;s fine . they &apos;re not pressing charges .
oh , thank god . you would not believe what i just came from .
look , serena , while we &apos;re alone ,
there &apos;s something i need to say to you .
are you ... fake @-@ breaking up with me ?
you know how guys say ,
&quot; it &apos;s not you . it &apos;s me &quot; ?
well , in this case , it &apos;s--it &apos;s my book .
well , don &apos;t worry . you haven &apos;t hurt my fake feelings .
i would never wanna get in the way of your career .
there you are !
ohh ! is everything okay ?
were you worried about little ol &apos; me ?
b. you smell like a distillery .
i had shots . they were fun !
the first ten , anyway .
oh , well , i &apos;m sorry i missed the excitement .
oh , i had someone to watch over me .
i &apos;m sorry .
she &apos;s so nice .
where &apos;s blair ?
with me .
can you get her to chuck &apos;s hotel ?
no . the plan is finished .
it &apos;s over .
and so are we .
beatrice , wait .
i don &apos;t want to play these games to hurt people .
i only want you ,
but you &apos;re never going to leave the church for me .
we both know it .
i &apos;m just the only one brave enough to say it out loud .
i wanted you to know
blair made it home safely .
i just tucked her in , and she is out like a light .
no surprise there .
i never thought i &apos;d see the day
when blair waldorf ate a tequila worm .
yeah , i never thought i would read something
written by serena van der woodsen
that made me laugh out loud , and even more pressi--
there were no witnesses ,
so i will deny it if asked publicly , but , uh ,
there may have been a lump in my throat .
really ? a lump ?
don &apos;t gloat , but seriously , i mean , it &apos;s--
it &apos;s surprisingly real for something supposedly fake .
well , not all fake .
no , i know . we--we dated for years ,
so of course there &apos;s history there .
yeah . but ...
but what ?
it ... i don &apos;t ... just ...
whatever . have a good night , okay ?
no , what is it ? tell me .
we &apos;re dan and serena . you can tell me anything .
it must be true , &apos; cause i read that online .
i @-@ i have to go . bye .
chuck , you need to leave now .
i don &apos;t know what it is you think i did tonight ,
but all i care about is her .
blair &apos;s asleep , okay ?
and even if she wasn &apos;t , she--
she wouldn &apos;t wanna see you anyway .
tell her i came by ...
and that i &apos;m not done .
that &apos;s one thing i learned from blair .
you don &apos;t give up on the people you love .
rise and shine , jailbird .
i made you french press .
oh , no , no , please , please . i beg you , no light .
here . you want your coffee ?
uh , stop spinning .
what are those ?
louis &apos; wedding vows .
i found them
hidden in my desk last night , and i was drunk enough
to allow myself a minor ethical transgression .
blair !
okay , how were they ?
it &apos;s like he peered into my soul .
i know louis loves me , but sometimes
i wonder if he understands me .
but reading this
is exactly what i needed to go into our wedding .
sure of my choice .
can i be a little jealous ?
you may .
i @-@ i can &apos;t wait for you to hear them on saturday ,
and you don &apos;t have to
keep up the charade with humphrey for me any longer .
louis and i are in a good place now .
yeah , well , i &apos;m glad everything worked out like it should have .
i &apos;m gonna go into the office now ,
take down my column . it &apos;ll help dan .
you ready ?
ready for what ?
no !
miss me , upper east siders ?
have you been asking yourselves if you &apos;re better off now
than you were two months ago ?
you &apos;ve made a grave mistake , beatrice .
you forget i still have your mother &apos;s ear .
and she had no trouble believing
you were still trying to ruin your brother &apos;s wedding .
so when i suggested you might benefit
from some missionary work in east africa , she agreed .
i &apos;ll tell my mother we slept together .
you &apos;ll be defrocked .
and whose word do you think she &apos;ll accept ?
her scheming daughter or her loyal , loving priest ?
you might be able to get rid of me ,
but you won &apos;t be able to stop the wedding .
which is why i have found someone far better equipped
to assist me in my cause .
that &apos;s probably your mother now .
bon voyage .
can you meet for lunch ?
well , i &apos;m kind of on a roll here . what &apos;s up ?
i actually talked to blair this morning ,
and she wants us to stay together until the wedding ,
just so louis doesn &apos;t suspect anything .
would you hate that ?
i mean , no . no , that &apos;s fine ,
but only until the wedding , right ?
yeah , no , of course .
you know , um , but we should probably still go out
to keep appearances up .
uh , sure . coffee ?
i don &apos;t know . i was thinking ,
you know , dinner could be better
or--or maybe a movie ?
yeah , that &apos;s fine by me . i &apos;ll call you later .
trapped under the weight of a false accusation ,
i &apos;ve done a lot of thinking
about the kind of girl i want to be from now on .
i &apos;d like to be the kind ...
who does what she says she &apos;s going to do .
thank you .
这是我们之间的秘密 - 路易
mr. bass , welcome .
right on time .
i have no interest in niceties . just tell me what you know .
i know what is in blair waldorf &apos;s heart ,
and if you don &apos;t want this wedding to happen ,
together , we can make sure it doesn &apos;t .
she already thinks i &apos;m a villain .
i may as well become one .
you know what they say-- talk is cheap .
so if you don &apos;t have anything nice to say ,
maybe you should just shut your mouth .
