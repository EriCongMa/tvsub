maura , what time is jane &apos;s doctor &apos;s appointment tomorrow ?
i forgot to write it down .
i forgot to tell you you don &apos;t need to cover it .
i can take her after all .
i thought tomorrow was the first day
of your seminar at bcu .
it was , um , but i realized that as a doctor ,
i am best poised to ensure the quality of your medical care .
you could go to your class . we &apos;ll be fine .
i &apos;ve given birth to three kids , and ...
i &apos;ve got enough poise for one o.b. appointment .
okay .
shall we ?
not so fast , professor .
why are you trying to get out of teaching this class ?
i told you --
because of my love and devotion for you above all else .
nope , didn &apos;t sell it . what &apos;s up ?
i ... the department head --
he told me that he is so excited about my syllabus
that he wants it to be a course for credit .
okay , how is that bad news ?
i &apos;ll have to give grades .
yeah , i don &apos;t want that burden on my shoulders .
i &apos;m still scarred
over the a @-@ minus biochemistry incident in 1996 .
i can &apos;t even imagine just crushing the spirit
of young , budding minds like that .
your budding mind was hardly crushed ,
and it &apos;s med school .
the budding minds of today will have patients tomorrow .
so ... grade hard , save lives .
hello ?
yes , governor . hello .
h @-@ h @-@ how can i help you ?
of course i understand .
thank you , governor . okay .
if he wants his nephew to get an &quot; a &quot; in your course ,
say no ... at least until the second offer .
he wants me to facilitate a death certificate .
chelsea rothsburgher passed away last night . cancer .
i guess they were close .
would you like to come with me , or should i take my own car ?
well , how long does facilitating take ?
if i &apos;m just signing , 15 minutes .
yeah , all right . i &apos;ll take you .
that would be great . thanks .
uh , you do understand that this is a favor the governor .
yes , i was right here when he asked you a minute ago .
that means no &quot; downton abbey &quot; jokes .
okay , no problem .
you promise ?
i promise ...
milady .
that &apos;s a little unnecessary .
oh , shoot !
what &apos;s wrong ?
i left my monocle in the car .
you didn &apos;t last 30 seconds .
well , what am i supposed to do if i get surprised ?
normally , i would gasp ,
and the monocle would pop out of my eye socket .
very funny .
but your snarky remarks are rife with errors .
it &apos;s your eye orbit , not socket .
and while monocles were very common in the 1880s ,
by 1912,
when &quot; downton abbey &quot; takes place ,
upper @-@ class men wore glasses due to advances in optometry ,
allowing for better measurement of refractions .
so the joke is on you .
really ?
oh , and the reason you don &apos;t know that
is because you &apos;ve never stayed awake long enough
to see one full episode .
it &apos;s called meditating . it &apos;s how i focus .
you &apos;ve never respected that .
the puddle of drool makes it hard .
she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer two years ago .
if you have questions , i know every aspect
of her medical history and care .
thank you .
and , as i said , i have prepared her death certificate ,
so you just need to sign it .
i &apos;m almost done .
the president used it ...
to sign the &quot; no child goes hungry &quot; bill .
she was a very impressive woman .
i worked for her for 20 years .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m so sorry for your loss .
jane .
excuse me .
i can &apos;t sign the death certificate .
well , there &apos;s a very fancy pen over there
if yours isn &apos;t working .
her bedclothes are soaked with sweat ,
and there are fresh bite marks inside her mouth ,
indicating violent seizures .
i don &apos;t know how she died ,
but i know it wasn &apos;t the cancer that killed her .
well , then , you need to do an autopsy .
well , in a perfect world ,
but there are certain sensitive hierarchical issues .
because dr. elbow patches over there
is the chief medical examiner
of the commonwealth of massachusetts ?
no , wait .
you are . problem solved .
dr. isles , are you quite finished ?
yes . thank you .
i am afraid this is a suspicious death ,
and i &apos;m ordering an autopsy .
you can &apos;t do that .
i am the chief medical examiner , so i respectfully disagree .
i &apos;m ... detective jane rizzoli , boston homicide .
um , if you &apos;re quite finished , we &apos;ll take it from here .
i &apos;m calling the governor !
great !
do it outside . this is now a crime scene .
see , if he was wearing a monocle ,
we would know if he was shocked or horrified .
now we can only suspect .
how many times has he called ?
by my count , a lot .
27 , to be exact .
all right , well , if he hasn &apos;t already
sent a governor &apos;s aide over here to shut you down ,
he will do so very soon .
so you almost done ?
uh , yes . i &apos;m moving as fast as i can
while still following protocol .
i &apos;ve ruled out seizures due to heart attack ,
epilepsy , stroke ,
meningitis , encephalitis , and toxoplasmosis .
there &apos;s one other possibility .
and instead of testing for that , you &apos;re gonna buy a goldfish ?
no , i &apos;m setting up a variation of the pyrogallol test .
okay , how much time do you
need before the fish tank is up and running ?
i need a few minutes .
okay . you got it .
what are you going to do ?
you don &apos;t want to know .
jane .
yeah ?
thank you .
for what ?
the ... plausible deniability , the support , the friendship .
you &apos;re welcome .
hello ?
yes , can you connect me
to the medical examiner &apos;s office , please ?
excuse me ?
no , i &apos;m trying to place a call .
who are you ?
really , you expect me to believe that the governor answers phones
at the medical examiner &apos;s office ?
chelsea rothsburgher &apos;s net worth is in the hundreds of millions .
her husband , larry sr. , was a financial genius .
he started his company with $ 1,000 and a copy machine .
he died in &apos; 05 .
used to be king of the tabloids .
so , who had easy access to the house ?
household staff and her two sons .
we &apos;ve got uniforms setting up interviews right now .
are we pushing hard or hardly pushing ?
until we get a cause of death , somewhere in between .
okay .
just pranked the governor for ... whatever this is .
i &apos;m gonna put chelsea &apos;s heart in the water ,
and then i &apos;m gonna remove the clamp from the pulmonary artery .
and if my suspicions are correct ,
we &apos;ll know right away .
you ready ?
for what ?
to bask ... in the wonder
that is scientific experimentation together .
or individually .
here we go .
that is ... wow !
you see what i mean ?
i &apos;m still basking .
di-- what do the bubbles mean ?
uh , well , first off ,
in a kinetic and spectroelectrochemistry study ...
nope .
uh , the mechanism of red oxidation ...
nope squared .
the release of gas bubbles indicate
that there was air in chelsea &apos;s heart .
all right , that &apos;s my girl .
hell , no .
so , what caused the embolism ?
uh , well , chelsea wasn &apos;t much of a deep @-@ sea diver ,
so somebody must have injected her with an empty syringe .
to make it look like she died of natural causes .
precisely .
why would someone murder a woman ...
that was already on her death bed ?
chelsea &apos;s lawyer sent over a copy of her will .
he said she contacted him three weeks ago .
to set up an appointment to make an addendum ,
and then she called a few days later and canceled .
what kind of addendum ?
she didn &apos;t tell him .
he wasn &apos;t sure if she wanted to add a bequest
or cut someone out of the will entirely .
i just talked to the maid , polly , and she said that a--
excuse me .
can i help you ?
we &apos;re doing a software upgrade .
they told me to just sit anywhere . am i in your way ?
you &apos;re kind of in someone else &apos;s chair .
oh , sorry . i didn &apos;t realize .
so , anyway , polly said chelsea met individually
with her sons and everyone on the staff
right after she started hospice care .
she said her goodbyes and told them
that she &apos;d take care of them after she died .
according to the will ,
every person on the staff is getting a lump sum .
holy zeros ! that &apos;s more than the pension we &apos;ll get for our 20 .
for all of us combined .
what do the sons get ?
a lot .
after some charitable bequests ,
the remainder of the estate is divided between them .
are you thinking someone was upset by their share of the pie ?
no , i think someone was so desperate for that money ,
they couldn &apos;t wait to get their hands on it .
医学院
let me get that .
here .
thank you .
my pleasure .
hi . jack .
hello . i &apos;m dr. maura isles .
i &apos;m teaching a seminar in forensic science .
first time ?
i wasn &apos;t sure if there was any , um , audiovisual , uh , system ,
so i just brought everything .
all you need is a password for the wireless system .
do you have a laptop ?
uh , yes . i do .
here we go .
all right .
there we go .
oh . i &apos;m very impressed .
i &apos;m just gonna run a quick test
to make sure the electrical system
has recovered from this morning .
oh , w @-@ why ? what happened ?
some idiot teacher got fed up with the texting and twittering
and went overboard with the visuals
to try to get the students &apos; attention .
and did it work ?
yep ! you bet -- for two whole minutes .
then , um ...
in retrospect , a laser show and 3 @-@ d holograms
was one gigawatt too many .
i just started my lecture on mechanical engineering ,
and the whole building blacked out .
oh , you &apos;re -- you &apos;re a teacher here .
you thought i was the a.v. guy ?
what ? no . no , i didn &apos;t .
yes , i totally did . i am so sorry .
don &apos;t be . don &apos;t be .
it means i &apos;m not annoying and pretentious ... yet .
um , thank you so much for your help .
anytime .
it was fun .
break a leg .
chelsea paid her people well .
the chef , the butler , and polly all own property
and have solid credit .
the chauffeur &apos;s the only one who can &apos;t live within his means .
what &apos;ve we got ?
uh , we got a chauffeur with a cash @-@ flow problem .
brad oskoff .
he has expensive tastes and 15 grand in credit @-@ card debt to show for it .
he only pays the minimum every month ,
so eventually he &apos;ll drown in compounded interest .
&quot; eventually &quot; is not worth killing over .
what about the kids ?
larry jr . -- successful businessman .
built his company from the ground up
without taking a cent of his family &apos;s money .
like father , like son .
on the other hand , the younger son , kalter ,
is 28 , still lives at home ,
and recently just got back from his 11th stint in rehab .
well , i doubt he abstains from the family fortune .
chelsea kept him heavily supervised .
no access to cash without the approval of his sobriety counselor .
what &apos;s his drug of choice ?
heroin .
well , if he &apos;s using again ,
he needs money , and i mean right now .
the rothsburgher mansion must be full of stuff
that a pawn @-@ shop owner would salivate over .
let &apos;s get a list of chelsea &apos;s valuables
from the insurance company ,
see if anything &apos;s missing .
hey .
hi , guys .
hey , ma .
ah , ma ! i -- i forgot !
i forgot about the doctor &apos;s appointment . i &apos;m sorry .
i got to reschedule .
jane , it &apos;ll only take an hour .
come on . let &apos;s go . it &apos;s important .
okay , well , then maybe i &apos;ll -- i &apos;ll --
i &apos;ll try for a saturday appointment .
i wrote the number down .
all right , i &apos;ll reschedule it for you .
that would be fantastic .
why are you doing this ?
a &quot; thank you &quot; would suffice .
you &apos;re right . thank you .
no , ma !
not in front of people !
you &apos;re very welcome .
thank you all so much .
thank you . nice to meet you .
thanks . thank you .
thank you .
you were great .
you think so ?
i ... i thought i completely botched the section
on the importance of statistics and dna matching .
that has nothing to do with teaching .
people just don &apos;t understand statistics .
well , i @-@ i must say that being in front of a class --
it &apos;s , um , invigorating .
it &apos;s like being a rock star ...
without the screaming fans or the money .
but i &apos;m -- i &apos;m dreading the grading part .
mm , it &apos;s the worst .
when i was a t.a. ,
i used to throw up before and after i turned my grades in .
oh , what did you do to change that ?
it just got easier over time .
i still dread it ,
but i don &apos;t throw up my guts anymore ,
so that &apos;s progress .
i guess i was hoping there was a way i could fix that .
probably not .
i don &apos;t think feelings can be fixed .
well , if you need any more unhelpful advice ,
i &apos;ll be around .
thanks . i &apos;m always looking for the least @-@ helpful advice .
well , let me help you with this .
thank you .
would you ...
want to get a coffee with me ?
i &apos;d love to .
great .
someone swipes my mom &apos;s necklace ,
of course you think it &apos;s me .
was it ?
are you crazy ?
i don &apos;t know people who could move a piece like that .
so that &apos;s your defense --
you wouldn &apos;t know how to unload it ?
no . my defense is i didn &apos;t do it .
how many times have you said ,
&quot; it wasn &apos;t me , &quot; or , &quot; i &apos;m not using &quot; ?
what do you think , a thousand ?
i &apos;m sober 74 days .
i don &apos;t care if you believe that .
you don &apos;t know anything about me .
well , you have a disease that &apos;s hard to deal with .
most people don &apos;t think it &apos;s a disease .
what about your mother ?
was she like most people ?
no , she wasn &apos;t like anybody else in the world ,
even after ... everything , she still believed in me .
i don &apos;t know why .
was she worried about you having access to your inheritance ?
she said to put it in a trust .
i can &apos;t access it till i &apos;m sober a year .
that &apos;s not in the will .
you think i killed my mother
&apos;cause i couldn &apos;t wait six months to get her money ?
the last thing i want in the world is my inheritance .
and you expect us to believe that ?
i &apos;m an addict .
that money will kill me ,
and not one person will be surprised ...
least of all me .
thank you for checking .
insurance company confirms that the diamonds in the necklace
were individually marked with an i.d. code .
so no breaking it down to sell the stones .
and it looks like kalter was right .
nobody tried to pawn it .
well , not worth the hassle .
the insurance company would spend hundreds of man hours
tracking it down .
the pawn @-@ shop owner would end up
on the wrong side of a stolen @-@ property charge .
detective korsak .
i bet you were shocked and appalled , indeed .
well , thank you very much .
one of the auction houses .
they took the necklace at consignment .
they &apos;re faxing over a still from the security video
of the guy that brought it in .
shocked and appalled ?
yeah , claimed they had no idea that stolen property was there
at such a prestigious establishment .
you buy that ?
not for a second , but i am trying to be less cynical .
that &apos;s larry rothsburgher .
now , that is the kind of stuff
that makes it hard for me not to be cynical .
my mother asked me to sell the necklace months ago .
i just forgot .
but ... i &apos;m glad you guys called me in
so i could help sort it out .
well , we &apos;re glad you &apos;re glad ,
&apos;cause there &apos;s just a few other things
we need your help with .
yeah , anything .
we were wondering why a guy
who built his business with his own money --
yeah , never took a dime of the family &apos;s money .
self @-@ made man , just like my dad .
right , yeah , you -- you &apos;ve said that a lot .
actually , i &apos;ve checked -- you &apos;ve -- you &apos;ve said that
in every interview you &apos;ve ever done .
and we looked into your company &apos;s finances ,
and selling that necklace
would buy you a few weeks , at best .
well , if you have something to say ...
say it .
your company &apos;s crashing .
your reputation as a businessman is going down with it .
getting that inheritance would stop that .
is that clear enough for you ?
i didn &apos;t kill my mother . i would never hurt her .
where were you the night she died ?
i was ... at home .
my wife was out of town , so ...
i was by myself .
doing what ?
reading .
reading what ?
proust .
i didn &apos;t think anyone still read proust .
which one of proust &apos;s many books were you reading ?
look , i &apos;m telling you the truth .
you have motive , access ,
and your alibi is not only flimsy ,
it &apos;s kind of pretentious .
and the only way we can help you
is if you &apos;re honest with us .
i want to talk to my lawyer .
hey , ma .
hey , there you are .
listen , you have to take folic acid as soon as possible .
good to know .
uh , were you able to reschedule my doctor &apos;s appointment ?
well , i tried ,
but if you don &apos;t cancel at least 24 hours ahead of time ,
they charge you ,
so i just went to the appointment .
you ... went to my doctor &apos;s appointment ?
for my pregnancy ?
yeah , i told them i &apos;m your mother .
i mean , i didn &apos;t pretend to be you .
i &apos;m not some kind of crazy person .
what did you talk about at my doctor &apos;s appointment ?
well , i asked them if i could be your midwife .
ma !
you &apos;re not going to deliver my baby !
it &apos;s not gonna be a home birth .
we could go to the hospital .
there &apos;s no &quot; we &quot; !
this is not a &quot; we &quot; ! the -- wha--
you know what ?
i can get my own vitamins . and i can talk to my own doctor .
and i can go to my own appointment .
i was just trying to help you .
well , you &apos;re not being helpful .
you &apos;re being invasive , and i need you to stop .
geez . ma .
five sigma &apos;s fun , but forensics solves crimes .
ah , okay .
five @-@ sigma &apos;s fun , but forensics solves crimes .
chin up .
five sigma &apos;s --
you would not believe what my moth--
what are you doing ?
89 , 90 , 91 .
i &apos;m just , um --
i &apos;m doing my usual 100 brushes a day .
what does it look like i &apos;m doing ?
it looks like you were singing into your hairbrush
and practicing for your summer @-@ camp talent show .
that &apos;s absurd .
the camps i went to never had talent shows .
what &apos;s that ?
&quot; thrombotic thrombocytopenic &quot; --
these are the worst lyrics ever .
i &apos;m practicing for my next lecture .
yeah , how did it go today ?
it went well ...
too well .
what happened ?
nothing .
it &apos;s just that now there are expectations
that i &apos;m gifted as a teacher ,
and i don &apos;t exactly know
what i did for anyone to think that .
so if someone , or anyone , comes to my next lecture
and they &apos;re disappointed , maybe they won &apos;t like me .
and maybe i don &apos;t want them to anyway .
okay .
someone paid you a compliment
that you &apos;re not really handling well beca--
you met a guy !
and you like him !
who is he ? !
his name is jack armstrong .
jack armstrong .
he &apos;s a professor .
a professor .
he knows how to use tools .
he &apos;s smart , he &apos;s funny ,
and he may actually be a grown @-@ up .
seriously ?
and when i look at him , i picture us having sex ,
if you get my drift .
it &apos;d be impossible not to .
wh-- but , okay , so what ? why are you so upset ?
because ...
because i know that it just won &apos;t work between us .
there &apos;s just no way .
he &apos;s married ?
nope . divorced , six years . has a daughter .
he &apos;s about to be deported ?
born and raised in michigan .
department rivalry ,
like a jets / sharks kind of thing ? it &apos;s --
jane , it &apos;s not gonna work
because it -- it just can &apos;t .
because every time i feel this way about someone ,
it ends badly .
okay , well , hang on a second .
i mean , uh ...
i &apos;ve never seen you like this .
you &apos;re -- you &apos;re swooning .
to swoon is to faint from emotion .
i know ! but i don &apos;t have a word
for singing in a sexy voice into your hairbrush .
i mean , come on .
give the guy a chance , okay ?
it &apos;s frankie . i got to go .
here .
okay , and we &apos;re sexy ...
sexy , sexy ...
go away .
... sexy .
hi , polly . what can we do for you ?
i heard mr. larry &apos;s being held here --
that you suspect him in his mother &apos;s murder ?
well , i &apos;m -- i &apos;m sorry ,
but we can &apos;t comment on an ongoing investigation .
but you &apos;re making a mistake !
he couldn &apos;t have hurt his mother .
when he found out she died ,
he was a wreck -- completely heartbroken .
i &apos;ve known him most of his life .
he &apos;s a good man .
well , sometimes good people do bad things , polly .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m very sorry .
his lawyers will let you know how to help .
usually , during the trial phase , friends and family --
no , you &apos;re not listening !
i can prove that he &apos;s innocent .
you can ?
larry did not murder his mother .
i did !
i understand that polly &apos;s confession was emotionally charged ,
but her claim that she helped chelsea commit suicide
by giving her a fatal dose of morphine is ... patently false .
chelsea rothsburgher did not die of an overdose of morphine .
well , she gave us a pretty detailed confession .
i mean , she told us how they came up with the plan ,
how they hoarded morphine , picked the day .
why would she admit it if it wasn &apos;t true ?
well , she could be protecting larry .
she could be a pathological liar with narcissistic tendencies .
she could be having a psychotic break .
or she could be telling the truth .
yep . she &apos;s telling the truth .
what just happened ?
because a second ago , she was a pathological liar .
well , i @-@ i tested chelsea &apos;s saline bag ,
and the contents are a mixture of saline and liquid morphine .
so polly did kill chelsea , just like she said .
her story is true , but she didn &apos;t murder chelsea .
by the time that polly injected the morphine in the saline bag ,
chelsea was already dead .
come again ?
if chelsea &apos;s heart had been pumping ,
the morphine would have been drawn into the blood flow
and killed her .
except that someone got to her first .
indeed .
well , she &apos;s guilty of attempted murder , at least .
mnh @-@ mnh . the law is very clear .
the attempted murder of a dead body is not a crime .
so , we &apos;re saying that two separate people
both just happened to try to murder the same person
on the same night ?
what do you think ?
no such thing as a coincidence .
maybe polly knew what larry jr. did
and thought she could protect him
by injecting the morphine and taking the fall .
that would be a good theory ,
but i just met with larry jr . and his lawyer ,
and i might have implied that our case is airtight
and that larry jr. is two steps away from death row .
massachusetts doesn &apos;t have the death penalty .
my point was made .
larry admitted he lied about his alibi
to protect his marriage .
oh , he was with another woman .
he was being intimate with two other women ...
and one man ... at the same time .
and unfortunately , there &apos;s video ...
for our eyes only .
did i say &quot; ours &quot; ? i meant yours .
oh , come on , guys . don &apos;t do this to me .
it &apos;s a chain @-@ of @-@ command thing , bud .
i &apos;m sorry . our hands are tied .
you remember the guy that sat there yesterday ?
yeah .
well , the desk , the chair --
it &apos;s just kind of become a thing .
you know , we need to do something to de @-@ thingify it .
you know what i mean ?
maybe if one of us , you know , sat there sometimes ,
it wouldn &apos;t seem so empty .
it &apos;s a great idea .
we should definitely do that .
i mean , uh , maura needs me now , so ...
yeah , i got to ... be somewhere .
are you looking for something ?
no , i &apos;m -- i &apos;m hiding from an empty chair .
literally or philosophically ?
both , i think . what are you doing ?
the final test results came back on the saline bag .
there was enough morphine in there to end her life
peacefully and painlessly .
is there any chance that the air embolism
could have killed chelsea when she was sleeping ?
no , she would have been wide awake
and felt every excruciating moment .
it &apos;s just tragic -- the brutal irony of her death .
how do you mean ?
well , she planned on dying one way ,
and then what happened was the exact opposite of what she wanted .
yeah .
dr. isles ?
yes . hi .
could you sign here , please ?
yes .
thank you .
thank you .
he wrote the card in latin .
barf .
what kind of flowers are these ?
it &apos;s actually a tree .
and over the next two weeks ,
the roots are gonna get so strong
that they &apos;re gonna break the ceramic pot
unless i re @-@ plant it with enough room to grow .
a latin card and a metaphor plant ?
he could be your soul mate ,
or your clone .
the truth is , i have been doing
a field study on dating for over 10 years ,
and i can no longer ignore the results .
there is no mr. right out there for me .
maura . come on .
all right , you can &apos;t look at relationships
like they &apos;re scientific experiments .
the guy who i had the most amazing sexual chemistry with ?
a face licker .
yeah .
and the next guy who i had feelings for
ended up dead ,
and i was framed for his murder .
to be fair ...
getting murdered was not his fault .
for all we know , he -- he could have been a wonderful boyfriend .
and then the guy who said that he really wanted my body --
he meant it literally , because he was a serial killer
who made sculptures out of dead women &apos;s bodies .
yes , that was unfortunate .
but ... would a serial killer
send you a romantic metaphor plant ?
i &apos;m not sure .
the nerium oleander has two meanings .
it &apos;s rare and beautiful and also deadly .
really ?
god , you &apos;d think a guy would brush up on his botany
before sending you a tree with mixed messages .
okay .
where are you going ?
honey . i &apos;m sorry .
i know you &apos;re iffy about trusting your gut
when it comes to men ,
but your professional instincts are spot on ,
and i think what you said about the irony about chelsea &apos;s death ,
that could actually be the key to this case .
that bad ?
i &apos;ve seen things i can &apos;t unsee .
you okay ?
larry &apos;s not our guy , and ...
let &apos;s not talk about it ever again .
it &apos;s probably for the best .
so maura told me that an air embolism is excruciating
and that chelsea probably woke up
and actually felt her heart exploding in her chest .
note to self -- don &apos;t go that way .
i think we &apos;ve been looking at this case in the wrong way .
it &apos;s not about millions of dollars .
the motive is more personal than that .
what do you mean ?
i think that someone found out
about chelsea &apos;s plan for assisted suicide ,
and they didn &apos;t want her to die peacefully .
they wanted her to suffer .
somebody hated her .
yeah .
so all we have to do is figure out who .
come on in .
thank you .
please have a seat .
i think it &apos;s best to be up front .
damn .
i ... haven &apos;t finished yet .
you were gonna say you &apos;re not that into me .
i &apos;m sorry .
i really thought we had chemistry .
it seemed like you thought so , too .
we do . i @-@ i just think that &apos;s ... that &apos;s actually the problem .
you &apos;re going with &quot; it &apos;s not you . it &apos;s me &quot; ?
oh , no , it &apos;s you . very much you .
that &apos;s direct .
for some reason , the men that i am attracted to
all have serious neurological and biological disorders .
and since i &apos;m wildly attracted to you ,
i strongly suggest that you get a full physical
and psychological checkup immediately .
and don &apos;t be afraid of a second opinion
because a misdiagnosis would cost you valuable time .
you &apos;re wildly attracted to me ?
i just told you that you might be severely ill ,
and that &apos;s all you heard ?
are you sure about this , maura ?
do you really want to live alone and fear ,
instead of with somebody who knows what it &apos;s like to be scared ?
no .
okay , then , so we &apos;re both terrified .
but the only thing that scares me more than getting hurt is ...
never falling in love again .
it only needs to work out once , right ?
that &apos;s what my best friend &apos;s mother always says .
your friend &apos;s mom is a very wise woman .
well , she also says
you have to kiss a lot of frogs to find your prince .
factually incorrect on many levels ,
but i still like the sentiment .
that &apos;s exactly what i said !
so , what do you think ?
i &apos;m not an amphibian with unlikely royal ancestry ,
but are you willing to take a chance on me anyway ?
did polly have any idea
who else might have known about her plan to kill chelsea ?
well , she swears they kept it absolutely secret .
but they talked about the plan for three weeks .
why so long ?
chelsea wanted every detail to be perfect ,
from the amount of morphine
to the wine she had with her last meal .
that &apos;s a lot of talk in a house full of people .
and the only visitors she had were her sons .
so her kids and the household staff are the only people
who could have overheard the suicide plan .
yeah . i &apos;ll have frankie do a deep background check ,
try and figure out who wanted to see her suffer .
ma , that &apos;s not what i ordered .
i mean , thank you .
and would you please sit with me while i eat ?
okay . i &apos;m sorry that i hurt your feelings .
and we can talk about my pregnancy .
it &apos;s just ... will you please just ...
be respectful of my boundaries ?
you think this is about my boundary problems ?
you don &apos;t have any boundaries , either .
you &apos;ve got 10 @-@ foot walls made of steel .
and i know why you built them ...
because you watched me make the mistake of being completely dependent .
so to avoid the same fate ,
you chose never to depend on anyone .
but now you have to decide
whether those 10 @-@ foot walls are working for you .
or are they just leftovers
from trying so hard not to be me ?
i &apos;m sorry i went to your doctor &apos;s appointment .
i should have asked you first .
who are you ,
and what have you done with my mother ?
eat your chicken .
what &apos;d you find ?
you remember brad oskoff ?
yeah , the handyman chauffeur
with the expensive tastes ?
his mother , katrina oskoff ,
司机
worked at the rothsburgher mansion from 1976 to 1979,
the year brad was born .
after that , katrina lived in a house
bought by the rothsburgher corporation .
she died of liver disease when brad was 16 years old .
that &apos;s the year he started working for the family .
what was that you said about coincidences ?
no such thing .
there &apos;s definitely a resemblance .
you know , if i was a rothsburgher by blood
but had to work as the help , i &apos;d be pretty pissed off , too .
do you think brad has been stewing on it all this time ?
jane .
yeah . i d ...
you guys , what are we gonna do about frost &apos;s chair ?
i think ...
you were right before . we should use it .
then what ?
only one way to find out .
i got to say ...
i know he &apos;s in my thoughts , he &apos;s in my heart ,
and some people would say he &apos;s in this room ,
but detective barry frost isn &apos;t sitting here .
yeah , it &apos;s just a chair .
a chair .
maura says that the syringe used to inject an air bubble
into chelsea &apos;s vein would be completely empty .
there would be no residue .
brad &apos;s too smart to throw the murder weapon away at the house .
where did he say he was the night chelsea died ?
at the movies .
a theater attendant saw him before and after .
so that leaves 2 hours and 40 minutes .
all right , i &apos;ll check the trash cans and dumpsters
on his route and at the movie theater .
he probably dropped the syringe somewhere along the way .
yeah .
the dna on the cylinder is yours .
probably got there when you took the cap off with your teeth .
people make that mistake a lot .
using a syringe is not a crime .
we also found some dna at the nose of it . it &apos;s a small sample .
we had to send it away for a specialized test ,
but we &apos;re confident it &apos;s gonna
come back testing positive for chelsea &apos;s dna .
until then , you have the opportunity
to give us your side of the story ,
make a better deal with the d.a.
not feeling chatty ?
all right , we &apos;ll go first .
yeah , it took us a while to see the resemblance .
same jaw . same eyes .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
when chelsea said she would give you a lump sum
just like the rest of the staff ,
was that the last straw ?
i didn &apos;t care about that .
i think you should . you &apos;re larry rothsburgher &apos;s son .
shut up !
you didn &apos;t know , did you ?
she wanted forgiveness .
she was sorry for not having welcomed me into the family
like she should have .
she just couldn &apos;t get over the fact that her husband
had an affair ... with my mom .
so she tried to give you money , make things right ?
i didn &apos;t get a chance to know my dad
when he was alive because it was too hard for her .
then she tried to make it right with a pile of money .
how did you know she was gonna commit suicide ?
because i saw polly hiding bottles of liquid morphine .
and the idea of her just ...
just getting to go to sleep ...
made you angry .
she decided my life was dirt .
why should she get to choose an easy death ?
she kept trying to breathe .
it only took three or four minutes ,
but it felt like a year .
well , she suffered . you got what you wanted .
why doesn &apos;t that make you happy ?
every time i close my eyes ...
i see her face staring at me .
and i ...
and -- and i ...
i think she was trying to forgive me .
i just want to go back to the day
that she told me the truth and say ,
&quot; it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s okay . &quot;
and just say , &quot; i forgive you . &quot;
and it &apos;s completely normal to be like a cat in heat
during your second trimester .
really ? i thought that was a myth .
mm , it &apos;s not , so beware of pregnancy goggles .
you mean like beer goggles ?
worse .
stick to these rules --
no fanny packs , no cellphone holsters ,
and no sandals with black socks .
well , that &apos;s just good rules for life in general .
you can &apos;t imagine how many times i used to ask your father
to pull the car over so we could get it on .
no , no !
no , no ! you see ?
that boundary -- you just blew right past it .
it ...
so it &apos;s okay to talk about sex with strangers ,
but not your father and your boss ?
write that down .
she took the triumph on her date ?
yeah , apparently he &apos;s a fan of the sidecar .
that &apos;s it ?
we &apos;re working on our boundaries .
yes , apparently ,
it &apos;s better if we let you volunteer things .
well , he didn &apos;t try to kill me .
that &apos;s a good sign .
what are you drinking ?
grapefruit lucys .
grapefruit ricky .
it &apos;s a grapefruit ricky but without the ricky .
it &apos;s just grapefruit .
may i have one , please ?
but a real one , not the one that we &apos;re making jane drink .
sure .
so , tell me ,
was the governor upset with jane &apos;s phone prank ?
well , according to the press conference ,
he was very glad that he pushed for further investigation .
so apparently not .
ooh . so this is a cause for celebration .
why , &apos; cause we solved the case
but we didn &apos;t get the credit ?
no , because you didn &apos;t get fired
and maura &apos;s pretty sure
she &apos;s not dating a serial killer .
hooray !
hooray !
give me one sip .
no .
