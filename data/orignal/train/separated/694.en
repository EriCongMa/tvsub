My father was an innocent man,
destroyed by powerful people.
The Graysons are behind this, and they're gonna pay.
I've dedicated my life to avenging his death.
Eventually, someone's gonna find you out.
And I won't stop until they've all paid the price.
I pronounce you man and wife.
I suspect you're about as pregnant as I am.
This photo proves that
you've been targeting my family and my son for years.
Good-bye, Victoria.
Two minutes and then fire.
I heard everything. You set me up.
Why did you tell me I was gonna be a father?!
I'm sorry.
Oh, my God. Where's Emily?
She should've beat me to the beach ten minutes ago.
Emily Thorne is still missing at sea.
Former Governor Grayson and his immediately family
are being questioned by authorities
at the Hamptons coast guard facility.
Now few details are known at this point,
格雷森家族海边危机
but what has been confirmed is
socialite Emily Thorne has disappeared
during her honeymoon cruise with publisher Daniel Grayson.
Now a Grayson family spokesperson says
all parties are cooperating fully with authorities.
And so far, there is no word yet on suspects or a motive.
Oh, my God. Nolan, what happened?
I-I don't know.
I just found out.
Oh, God. Nolan, I'm so sorry.
What can I do to help?
I don't know.
Uh, I'm gonna go find Victoria.
I'll call if I get any--any information.
Uh, keep in touch?
Yeah, I will.
Okay. All right.
Here's to you, Ems,
and well-laid plans.
No!
I had Emily's signal for a moment. Now it's gone.
I thought you said
you could track her anywhere on the planet?
The transmitter may have been broken in the fall.
I have to go find her.
Hold on. The currents could have taken her anywhere.
Do you understand that?
You saw her dress! She was shot twice!
And she'll need to treat her wounds,
so she'll go to the channel marker,
because we left an emergency case there.
I don't understand how this could've happened.
Emily plans for every last detail.
I thought we'd prepared for all the variables,
but it turns out we were lying to ourselves
in order to meet that damn deadline of hers.
It's all my fault.
No. It's mine.
What are you talking about?
I gave her that deadline.
I told her that if she didn't finish this,
I would expose who she really was.
What?
I just wanted her to stop.
It's her. She's got it working again.
Go to Ross, tell him what happened.
You wait for me there. I may need both of you.
Go!
I was Governor of this state,
so don't tell me what can't be done.
I want more choppers in the air, and I want them now.
Okay.
We're gonna find Emily, Charlotte.
I'm using all the resources at my disposal.
You know, I don't get it.
Someone close to us shot Emily.
I know exactly where you were, and Daniel.
But Mom?
Just let the police do their jobs.
All right, sweetheart?
I hate to ask, Mr. Grayson,
but I need to establish your whereabouts
at the time of the shooting.
He was with his family.
We were watching a wedding video in the main cabin.
I-I'd be much obliged
if you could offer this young man a moment alone.
We're gonna find her, son.
My photographer and I were covering the honeymoon
for "Voulez."
We were in the main room with the family
when the captain sounded the alarm.
And who was with you at that time?
I don't know. There was so much confusion.
Uh, but perhaps these might help.
They're photos of the event.
Hundreds of them.
Am I free to go now?
Yes, Ms. LeMarchal.
Uh, but please don't speak of this investigation with anyone.
No, no. Of course.
And why weren't you listed
on the official manifest, Ms. Davis?
I was a late addition.
Conrad.
Can you tell this overblown hall monitor
that I was sitting with you when Emily was shot?
I can confirm her statement.
But thanks for your diligence, officer.
I had hoped that lying to the authorities
was not gonna be a component of this relationship.
Do you mind sharing where you actually were?
I didn't do this, conrad. Honestly.
I was waiting for you in our cabin.
But since no one can confirm that,
I didn't want to risk telling that to the police.
We finally have a second chance at a life together.
I don't want anything getting in the way of that.
Neither do I.
We found shell casings on the deck, Mrs. Grayson.
That means somebody onboard shot your daughter-in-law.
And yet, I can't seem to get you to tell me
exactly where you were when all this happened.
I don't appreciate your tone, detective.
Well, I'm sorry, Mrs. Grayson.
But when a witness refuses to cooperate,
my antenna goes up.
I am not the shooter.
Let's leave it at that and move on.
All right.
Let's discuss the public feuds you've had with the victim.
Not without my lawyer.
I need to get you to a hospital.
Don't take me back.
Let's just go.
Like we wanted to.
If I don't get you help, you're going to die.
Do you understand?
I just want...
I wanna be with you.
Okay. Okay.
Emily. Em.
Emily, you stay with me.
Emily?
Oh, god.
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!
Everything fell apart.
Aiden said that Victoria even knew about the fake pregnancy.
So Victoria shot her?
She couldn't have.
He drugged her and brought her below deck.
Well, then who did this?
We're gonna find out. Emily's alive.
She's at Suffolk Memorial.
I found her on a boat. She was in shock.
So I didn't have much time,
but I made sure that the captain discovered her.
You didn't bring her in?
I couldn't take the risk.
Our connection would've been revealed,
and Emily would've been exposed.
You can't toy with her life like that.
Your plan is over. Let it go!
Who the hell are you to lecture me?!
You were the one who drove her to this.
So why don't we focus on how we can help her?
Because if she survives,
she is still in danger, maybe now so more than ever.
He's right.
Once the Graysons find out she's alive,
they'll--they'll panic.
They'll spin some cover story to protect themselves.
Or they'll finish the job.
Not on my watch. I'm gonna get some answers.
How you gonna get past the Graysons?
They'll turn that hospital into a fortress.
Then it's a good thing that I paid for half of it.
You wanna help Emily?
Go talk to that girlfriend of yours.
She was there.
Find out what happened.
Mom?
I've been trying to get to you for over an hour.
What the hell is going on here?
Oh, my god.
I've become an official person of interest.
And judging by the look on my attorney's face,
I have every reason to be concerned.
Is there...
something you wanna tell me?
If there is, you know, I can handle it.
No, I didn't do it, Patrick.
But after learning the truth about Emily, oh, I wanted to.
What truth?
She has been targeting my family for years.
She even faked her pregnancy to trap Daniel into marriage.
I confronted her. She admitted it.
But you should've seen the look on her face,
as if she were taunting me.
Why would she come after you like that?
I have no idea.
It's like an obsession.
I shouldn't have left you last night.
Do not punish yourself.
You're the only person I can truly trust.
And I need you now more than ever.
Well, then come here.
Sit down, please.
We're gonna prove that you're innocent.
I don't know how.
I'm in terrible trouble.
I was with Emily just before she was shot.
And then what happened?
I don't know. I, uh...
I...
blacked out.
And then I woke up in the stateroom.
I have no idea how I got there.
You gotta tell the police that.
A story that sounds like delusional ravings
of a woman who's trying to prove she's innocent?
No, Patrick.
My only hope is that this never surfaces.
Daniel, I need you to focus.
Sorry.
We were talking about your mother.
Can you tell me about her problems with Emily?
What has that got to do with anything?
Well, I think it's safe to say they don't... get along.
My mother didn't shoot her.
Lydia Davis claims
Victoria was upset with Emily right before the attack.
Something about a photograph?
Lydia Avis is one step above a call girl.
Her word means nothing.
Well, if I only took the word of respectable people,
I'd never solve a case.
Detective, you have a second?
Vessel... with the coast guard.
Thanks.
They found your wife.
Is she, uh...
Yes, she's alive.
Emily's a very lucky woman.
She suffered massive blood loss
from the gunshots to the abdomen,
and she sustained a cranial injury
from the impact of the water.
There's been some bleeding on the parietal lobe,
which we'll monitor, but she'll pull through.
What about the baby?
I think it would be best if I talk with Mr. Grayson alone.
Come on, Charlotte.
Mrs. Grayson,
I'm afraid the police have insisted
that you not be allowed access to the patient.
Daniel, we'll be at the house if you need us.
Daniel, I'm afraid I have troubling news.
Blood tests show your wife was...
never pregnant.
I'd like to keep this private.
Mr. Ross, you may as well to turn around right now.
This is a family matter.
Emily is my family,
and I'm gonna make damn sure that yours doesn't harm her.
How dare you speak to me that way,
after what you've been up to.
What has Daniel ever done to you?
Do you get off causing innocent people pain?
I will let you know if I meet anyone innocent.
So in the meantime, I'm gonna go see Emily.
You have no legal right.
Without a family representative,
you may not go beyond those doors,
no matter how many wings you've named after yourself.
Well, let's...
see what your son has to say about that.
Look, Nolan, it's best if you just go.
I thought that we said
that we weren't gonna let the women in our lives
get in the way of what we have?
So just help me. Please.
You didn't go to the city last night.
You were with him.
I told you these people couldn't be trusted.
How could you?! Oh, how could you?
Mom.
Get out of here.
Go.
Where...
Where am I?
You're in the hospital.
Why?
What happened?
You don't know?
What you remember?
Nothing.
I don't remember... anything.
Please, tell me...
Who am I?
I should've come with you.
Yeah, believe me,
there was no getting past either of them.
I had no choice but to pull the ejector seat.
Now we have no way in.
Do really think that I didn't have a backup plan?
Welcome to Suffolk Memorial's internal server.
I left a smartphone behind to create a makeshift hot spot.
Now I have access to the patient files.
Well done. Where's Emily's?
She's stabilized,
but those bullets really did some internal damage.
Oh, no.
"Transient global amnesia"?
Aiden, that's major cerebral trauma.
She's surrounded by the enemy.
She's faking her condition to buy herself time.
Yeah, it does sound like my Ems.
She just gave us the opportunity to move her out of there.
To where?
I know a safe house where she can get medical attention
away from the Graysons.
Now can you access the other hospital computer systems?
You give me enough time,
and I will make the toilets flush in morse code.
Margaux.
Oh, I'm glad to see you.
I got your messages.
You okay?
Uh, yeah. I'm fine.
I am so sorry about Emily.
What happened out there?
I wish I knew. I saw nothing.
I was in the main room.
And all the Graysons claim to have been there, too.
Someone's lying.
Are these...
Are these copies of the pictures you gave to the police?
No, I hid these from them.
They're the ones taken at the time Emily was shot.
After what you told me about Conrad,
I couldn't risk it.
It's a good move.
Well, if Conrad is guilty,
he's done an excellent job of hiding it.
Look. He's in photo after photo at the time of the shooting.
This means he had someone else pull the trigger.
Or maybe he didn't do it.
The press think it's Victoria.
She truly hates Emily.
And she's not in any of those photographs.
She's not the only one missing from these pictures.
You've spent more time out in this hall
than in there with her.
Well, she needs her rest.
Even if she were awake,
I don't know what I'd say.
Don't beat yourself up, Daniel.
None of this is your fault.
I checked on Sara.
She's okay.
And don't worry. Emily will get better.
She will pull through.
I know the police talked to you about Mom.
They asked me, too.
Well, she--she's innocent, Charlotte.
I don't think she is.
No one does.
I never knew how uncomfortable this chair was.
When I showed you that picture, Victoria,
I simply wanted you to know the truth about Emily.
I never expected for you to shoot her.
You're out of your depth, Lydia.
You always have been.
Cross me again, and watch what happens to you.
Ooh. Your confidence is woefully misplaced, Victoria.
You lack an alibi to substantiate your claims.
And hiding from your lawyer
instead of offering anything plausible reeks of guilt.
I'm really enjoy remodeling Grayson manor.
I always thought this room could use a splash of color.
You like that? Huh?
No?
Get out of my house!
You're certainly behaving like someone incapable of murder.
But I do look forward
to your performance on the stand, my dear.
I've always enjoyed a good farce.
Ross, I'm here.
I'm going in.
I just finished looping the security cameras.
You can now move through the hospital undetected.
There's one more thing I need you to bring with you to the safe house.
Engagement ring, perhaps?
Yeah, few steps ahead of you, Mathis.
Figured you wanna put that little trinket
back on her finger.
I'll stand by
until you are in position on Emily's floor.
We need to talk.
Actually, I don't think we do.
See, I needed your help today.
But instead, you decided to check back into the Bates motel.
And you know what, Patrick?
Frankly, I'm not into Mama's boys.
W-well, let's continue to talk about you, Nolan.
You manipulated me, and you did it just to get what you wanted.
You're no different than Emily.
So now you're going to attack a woman
that is fighting for her life in a hospital bed?
That's classy.
Oh, please! Let's stop, all right?
She's not as innocent as you make her out to be, Nolan!
And quite frankly, neither are you.
You know what, man?
I should've bailed the minute I found out
you bribed my ex-wife to get dirt on me.
Well, don't let me stop you now.
All right, Mathis.
Let's do this.
I'm in.
There's an ambulance waiting for us downstairs.
I've arranged for medical attention
to meet us at the safe house.
Please don't hurt me.
Who are you?
Emily?
Emily? Em, what are you doing?
Help me!
Somebody!
There was a man.
He wanted to take me out of here.
He went out the window.
No. It's okay.
It was just a nightmare.
No.
You're all right.
You're okay.
What's... what's wrong?
We tried to get Emily out.
It, uh...
It didn't go well.
She didn't recognize me.
All I saw in her eyes was fear.
It's bad.
There's... brain swelling.
It's neurological damage, but...
I did some research,
and her diagnosis is as psychological
as it is physiological.
So what are you saying? That it's not just from her injuries?
Her mind shut down.
It's a defense to deal with the trauma.
Emily needs someone
to just make an emotional connection with her,
So she feels safe to be... well, Ems again.
Ross, I was--I was with her.
That doesn't work.
Yeah, well, you went in guns hot.
Emily wasn't exactly primed to find her happy place.
Getting past the Graysons won't be easy.
But, Jack...
Maybe you can go talk to Charlotte.
No.
I did this to her.
I pushed Emily, and now she's...
She's like this.
Seeing me may only make things worse.
This is evidence that Margaux found.
I thought you should have a copy.
Take care of her.
Just let him go.
What is the matter with you two?!
Emily needs us!
Look, for all we know, someone is biding their time,
waiting to finish the job!
You're right.
What is our next move?
There's some things I need to do alone.
Mom.
Daniel.
Oh, I'm so grateful you're here.
You understand that these accusations against me
are untrue?
They say you're gonna be arrested.
Well, I'll endure.
But I promise you, nothing is as it seems.
I know.
I know everything.
You've been right about Emily from the start.
I did it.
I shot her.
You overheard us on the deck.
I just got a call about Sara.
She tried to kill herself.
I couldn't breathe. I went outside.
That's when I heard you both.
I didn't go up there to hurt her.
I was just so angry.
Daniel, where did the gun come from?
I I don't remember. I was drunk.
The gun was there. I-I picked it up, and--and it...
Now they're blaming you.
And I know we've had our problems,
But I am not gonna let you go down for my crime.
Daniel, you have to understand that Emily set you up.
For all we know, she put the gun there.
She is a monster.
I will not allow you to sacrifice yourself
for her cruelty.
No, mom.
Daniel, please.
No. No.
My life isn't your problem to fix.
Now I'm getting a lawyer.
And tomorrow, I'm turning myself in, and this will all be over.
No.
Victoria.
I'm surprised to see you.
Coming here in the middle of this media firestorm
may not be the smartest thing to do,
But...
I need an ally.
And I couldn't help but notice
that you've yet to take a public stance on my guilt.
I like to know all the details of a story before I tell it.
Jack told you what Conrad did to his family?
Yes.
How did you know?
I didn't.
But Jack is a man of principle,
and I would think that he would want you to know the truth,
given your long-standing history with my family.
I was shocked to hear what Conrad is capable of.
I think he's trying to frame me.
You want more than an ally, Victoria.
You want an objective party to help prove your innocence.
And expose Conrad's guilt.
You were there, Margaux,
and yet, you don't seem to buy the police's theory.
Is there something you're not sharing?
These are copies of photos taken moments after Emily was shot.
Each guest claims to have been in the main room.
Lydia.
She's not here.
Which means she lied to the police.
You look so beautiful.
It was a like a real-life fairy tale.
You've gotta remember something.
I don't.
I know you will.
You're my inspiration, Emily.
I've always relied on your strength to get me through tough times.
I just wish I knew where you got it from.
My father.
You remember him?
Yes.
That's good, Emily.
What's his name? Tell me.
David.
His name is David Clarke.
These were taken in the yacht's main cabin
moments after the shooting.
Lydia's nowhere to be seen,
which contradicts her official statement.
Oh. If you're trying to frame her,
I assure you, your plan is as foolhardy as it is desperate.
Oh, I won't be framing Lydia.
You will.
Well, now you can add "Delusional" to the list.
Why would I consent to that?
To protect Daniel.
He shot Emily.
That's absurd.
Why would he?
Because she is a sick and venomous liar
who toyed with his emotions.
She broke him, Conrad.
And when he finally learned the truth about her,
he lashed out.
My God.
You're serious.
As serious as Daniel's desire to protect me.
He will confess unless we act.
And we cannot let him throw his life away
for that vicious woman.
Which leaves us one course of action.
Lydia goes.
It's a terrible feeling, betraying someone you love.
I'm so pleased that you finally get
to experience the sensation yourself.
Hey. I thought you'd be getting Carl by now.
So did I.
But now I'm not so sure.
This thing with Emily has really...
It's really gotten to me.
Yeah. Me, too.
I've been trying to help her,
but the weirdest thing just happened.
What?
Emily said she remembered her father.
And when I asked what his name was,
she said, "David clarke."
Well, she--I mean, she probably...
Saw you and then got mixed up, you know?
Maybe.
She seemed so sure of it.
It freaked me out.
Charlotte, um,
I think it might help if I see Emily.
Look, she's obviously confused.
I think I can help her remember that she's Emily Thorne
And not...
someone else.
There you are.
I know everything that's happened has been a nightmare.
But I feel safe knowing that we're handling it together.
What's wrong?
We've been exposed.
I have to revise my statement to the police.
They'll know I was lying.
Yeah, well, Lydia, I have no choice.
I mean, I'm facing an obstruction of justice charge.
Conrad, we're talking about my life.
Our life.
I haven't done anything wrong.
I need your help.
Well, and I'm gonna be there for you.
Oh, come on. What do you have to be concerned about?
After all, you're -- you're innocent, right?
All you have to do is trust me.
That's what you said to David Clarke.
Oh, come on. This is an entirely different situation.
Don't you think?
I'm gonna look after you.
So don't do anything rash.
And stay here,
I know where to find you.
I'll get that for you.
Thank you.
My pleasure.
It's done.
She's gone.
That's an interesting tattoo.
What does it mean?
I'm not sure.
I saw you earlier.
What's your name?
Excuse me. Could you give us some privacy, please?
Sure.
Emily,
meet Jack.
A statewide search is on for Lydia Davis,
now the prime suspect in the brutal shooting of Emily Grayson.
Police report the socialite was last seen
leaving an exclusive east Hamptons Inn earlier today.
So do you have any idea what you've cost me?
Daniel, I just allowed myself to believe
that life could be something other than gray and cold.
And I was forced to sacrifice all of it to protect you.
Well, I didn't ask you to.
I was handling it myself.
You were?
What, by admitting that you shot your wife?
How very noble for you.
It's more than you would've ever done.
Have you lost your damn mind?
I just offered you freedom at my expense,
And you made it with reprobation?
Okay. All right, fine.
But if that's the case,
the next time you find yourself in need of salvation,
may I suggest that you drop to your knees and you pray?
Because from here on, your only hope
will be divine intervention from the Heavenly Father himself
because your earthly father is finished with you!
You don't think I've sacrificed?!
All I have ever done is sacrifice for everyone!
And I have lost the one person who meant anything to me,
who never lied to me, who loved me.
Sara? Well, there's no accounting for taste.
You say one more thing about her. I beg of you.
Oh, you wanna take this out on me?
You better think again,
because I am this close to showing you
what I'm truly capable of.
Do it, 'cause I've got nothing left to lose.
What are you doing here, Niko?
Well, when I heard what happened To Emily Thorne,
the news didn't mention anything about you.
So I came to make sure you're okay.
Well, I had to go radio silence. You knew that.
And why are you treating Emily?
That's too risky for you.
I'm the best doctor you know.
I saved your life when you got shot. Didn't I?
Yes.
And for that, I owe you a debt.
Which I plan on collecting.
And I thought that instead of trying to find you,
it'd be easier to just stay close to Emily
and hope you showed up.
Well, you shouldn't have come.
Well, I'm here,
so use me.
Fine.
You stay close to Emily.
But whatever you do--
Don't trust the Graysons.
I know. I remember.
Do yoremember what I told you?
Yes.
Nothing's changed.
You're getting rid of it?
It's been tarnished,
and thus lost its unique appeal.
I'm sorry for letting you down.
I can't tell you how to live your life, Patrick,
or who to live it with.
Do what makes you happy.
I know what you're doing.
Someone hurts you, and you run.
That's your M.O., right?
I'm not gonna let you push me away.
No, I told you before, we're a team.
So I'm staying right here.
And together, we're gonna take down everyone who ever wronged you--
Conrad, Emily, and Nolan.
He keeps this, um, box
locked up behind the painting that he took from you.
Uh, it's got this design etched on the side of it.
Two infinity symbols. They're linked together.
I swear I've seen it before.
Was it something like this?
It was exactly like that.
There's something so familiar about you.
Well, we've known each other for a very long time.
Sort of.
There's kind of a big gap there.
What happened?
I literally have no idea how to answer that question.
I hate this.
I-I feel so helpless.
If it's any consolation,
you are the strongest person I have ever known.
People keep saying things like that.
I don't feel it.
Trust me.
You are the toughest,
most annoyingly bullheaded person on the planet.
Emily, I'll admit that there have been times I...
never wanted to see you again.
But...
then you left me this.
What is it?
It belonged to my wife.
Amanda.
She was wearing it when she died.
And you were there.
I know you don't remember this, but we had a big fight about it.
We've... had a lot of fights this summer, actually.
That's my fault. I...
I've been holding on to all that pain and...
and anger, and putting it on you.
It's not fair.
I'm so sorry.
That's what I wanted to say on the beach.
Come back to us, Emily Thorne.
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.
Don't be.
Daniel.
No.
It's Jack.
Daniel.
Daniel shot me.
