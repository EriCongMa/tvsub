over 68 million americans
leave the safety of our borders every year .
if danger strikes ,
the fbi &apos;s international response team
is called into action .
i bet you didn &apos;t know i could samba like that .
with you , nothing surprises me .
oh , crap !
we need to post !
what ? no !
relax . we &apos;re on our honeymoon .
we &apos;re not at a photo shoot .
but all our adoring fans
and jealous friends await us .
ah , well , then .
wait , wait . let me see it .
oh , it &apos;s fine .
there &apos;s your fine and then there &apos;s mine .
it &apos;s good .
you mean you look good .
that &apos;s exactly what i mean .
yeah .
there .
let &apos;s get outta here . come on .
i still can &apos;t believe we did it .
i &apos;ve got the pictures , a wedding ring ,
and a marriage certificate to prove it ,
so don &apos;t get any crazy ideas .
i love you , johnny .
i love you too , baby .
when we get back to the hotel ,
i &apos;m gonna show you how much .
that &apos;s gonna have to wait .
what ? holding out already ?
i thought we had a few years before that started .
no , silly . i have a surprise for you .
but we have plans back at the hotel .
okay , i know being spontaneous takes you out of your comfort zone ,
but trust me , you &apos;re gonna like this .
okay . turn down here .
keep going .
what &apos;s goin &apos; on ?
i have no idea .
they &apos;re right on our --
why are they following us ?
i don &apos;t know !
just -- just don &apos;t stop .
oh , god .
i &apos;ll take a cup of paranoia , please .
i know . we &apos;re so ridiculous .
i mean ...
josie , we &apos;ll revisit this in a few years .
you got to trust me on this one .
录取通知书
hey , boss .
everything all right ?
yeah . josie got accepted to usc .
congratulations .
yeah , yeah . it &apos;s a great school .
i &apos;m just not sure that she &apos;s ready
to move that far away from home .
she &apos;s not ready or you &apos;re not ready ?
okay , simmons ,
enough sharing the new crunch tips you learned .
it &apos;s good to see some things never change .
except , you seem to be packing a bigger gun , this time around .
well , it &apos;s been a long time since i shot anything .
i figure the bigger it is ,
the better chance i have at hitting something .
aloha .
okay , let &apos;s download everyone , monty .
okay . american newlyweds john davis ,
a software developer ;
and susie davis , a jewelry maker ,
are missing in san pedro , belize .
they were last seen
at a local watering hole named serranos ,
where , i hear , the cow @-@ foot soup is to die for .
bride &apos;s father grew suspicious
when the couple suddenly stopped posting on social media
or wouldn &apos;t answer his calls .
so he called the hotel
and found out they got a hotel service car ,
a red jeep , 2 days ago , and never returned it .
they assumed that they they drove to the other side of the island
and eventually would come back .
his next call was to the u.s. consulate .
where , it turns out , our newlyweds registered
as soon as they arrived .
who registers with the consulate ?
somebody efficient , organized .
speaking of , i just checked their credit cards
and it seems that they &apos;ve been inactive
aver since they left serranos 36 hours ago .
unfortunately , the kidnapping of foreigners
by drug cartels in central america
and neighboring mexico has become commonplace .
except , there &apos;s been no ransom demand .
monty , check with local pd .
see if any other tourists have gone missing in belize
over the last few years .
you got it .
on a rural road at night ? you think maybe
they saw something they shouldn &apos;t have ?
then they &apos;re definitely in trouble .
and they need our help .
an old belizean creole proverb tells us
&quot; all journeys have secret destinations
of which the traveler is unaware . &quot;
so we don &apos;t have an embassy in san pedro .
we &apos;ll check in with the consulate
and get clearance for all our weapons and vehicles .
copy that .
mae , i want you to meet with the rso
to get a feel for the situation
on the ground there .
way ahead of you , boss .
i already traded emails with the regional security officer ,
who gave me the lay of the land and
said that there have been no recent abductions .
simmons , have you had a chance to run a topographic profile yet ?
yep , roger that .
the terrain they were last seen in changes very quickly
from paved roads to rainforest jungles .
and anything this beautiful has to be dangerous .
funny , that is what my tinder profile says .
even though belize borders with mexico ,
it has much more in common with the caribbean .
that &apos;s why they all speak creole .
exactly . it &apos;s a pidgin language
derived mainly from english ,
but includes spanish and west african languages like bantu and akan .
let me guess . you speak that , too .
what ?
i so would &apos;ve hated you in high school .
jack , it &apos;s good to see you again .
you too -- how &apos;s the family doing ?
getting too big , too fast .
oh , i know it all too well .
thanks for having us .
well , much like last time you were working here ,
wish it was under better circumstances .
well , let &apos;s see what we can do about changing that .
we ran a preliminary investigation .
we spoke to witnesses at serranos ,
followed the road that they drove on ,
but weren &apos;t able to find them ,
or anything criminal in nature .
so your team has concluded
there was no crime committed here ?
well , there &apos;s always the possibility of a crime having taken place ,
but , with our small police force , limited resources ,
we have done everything we could within our capabilities .
well , you mind if we kick the tires on this ?
of course not .
just try not to scare away too many of the tourists .
jack . monty &apos;s on the batphone .
i got your notes on the rso ,
saying there &apos;ve been no recent tourist kidnappings in belize .
my search is showing the same thing , going 5 years back .
monty , throw out a wire net with interpol .
see what comes back .
you &apos;ve got it , boss .
what else can you tell us about our lovebirds ?
they &apos;ve got quite the social media footprint :
facebook , twitter , sweet source page .
sweet source ?
crowdbased fundraiser ,
so that couples who are financially challenged
can help to raise money for their dream honeymoons .
so they weren &apos;t targeted for their money .
they certainly do look very much in love .
having a blast . miss you .
thank you !
it &apos;s well @-@ planned , detailed .
yeah , by giving away locations and times ,
they &apos;re making it easier for them to be tracked .
so the unsub could &apos;ve stalked them via posts ,
saw them more up close and personal ,
and then followed them that night .
monty , see if anyone local
was checking out our honeymooners &apos; site .
i already parsed the access logs ,
to identify any site visitors
with source routing that originated in belize .
now , i &apos;m just filtering traffic , looking for packets
that traveled through the latin american
or caribbean internet exchanges ,
but nothing &apos;s popping up .
well , if we go by their set itinerary ,
they were supposed to come back to the hotel
for a romantic candlelit dinner , but never made it .
clara , mae , pay a visit to the hotel
and see if you find any leads .
simmons , go to the road near serranos
and see if anything pops out at ya .
i &apos;m randall cowen . i @-@ i just flew in .
my daughter &apos;s s @-@ susie davis ,
the missing bride .
i &apos;m jack garrett , fbi .
why don &apos;t we step outside here ?
sorry to make you wait .
i &apos;m agent russell montgomery
with the fbi &apos;s international response team .
i &apos;m steven davis .
this is my wife , mary .
what &apos;s going on ?
we spoke to susie &apos;s father , randall .
he said that they got into some kind of trouble on their honeymoon ?
unfortunately , yes ,
but we have boots on the ground
and we &apos;re knee @-@ deep in an investigation .
what happened ?
we &apos;re not completely sure , yet ,
but we do know that they &apos;re missing .
we &apos;re doing the best that we can ,
so let &apos;s try to stay positive .
mr. cowen , i &apos;m a father also ,
so i can imagine how difficult this must be .
rest assured , we &apos;re on top of it .
i appreciate that , agent .
so , anything you can tell me , at all , about john and susie ?
any troubles ?
not that i know of .
they seem very much in love .
is there any tension between you and your daughter ?
no , no . why do you ask ?
well , you seem to be a man of means ,
but your daughter had to raise money for her own honeymoon .
when my wife died , susie was all i had left .
what i saw as protection , she saw as smothering .
so , when she turned 18,
she decided to march to the beat of her down drum ,
and with that came financial independence .
one day , you &apos;re coming home and they &apos;re yelling &quot; daddy &quot;
and jumping into your arms and ,
before you know it , it stops .
anything else ?
susie &apos;s a spark plug . if she &apos;s in trouble ,
she &apos;ll fight to the end .
please stay by your phone .
we &apos;ll let you know anything as soon as we do .
thank you .
at least she &apos;s a fighter .
that &apos;s not good .
fighters can end up dead quickly ,
depending on who &apos;s holding them .
he @-@ e @-@ e @-@ lp !
please !
someone , anyone , please , help !
susie ? susie , you there ?
john ? john , are you okay ?
i &apos;m in a lot of pain .
okay . okay , we have to get out of here .
can you see anything ? a door ? some way out ?
no .
john . john .
john , look out !
we &apos;re gonna need full access to your security footage .
that way , we can review or interview any guests
they may have spoke to .
these people are on vacation .
we understand that , ma &apos;am .
but their lives might be in danger ,
so any information that we have can help out .
i &apos;ll have security get you what you need .
this way .
makin &apos; friends everywhere we go .
thank you .
you take the left ?
yep .
i told you , while you were gone ,
that i almost got married , right ?
no .
i met this guy and we just really ,
really fell hard for each other and ...
decided to take the plunge .
then , i had to choose between him and the job , so ,
i chose good @-@ old j edgar .
mae , if your fiance made you choose ,
he wasn &apos;t the right guy , in the first place .
well , he didn &apos;t make me choose , but he would &apos;ve ,
so i just decided to rip the band @-@ aid off
and spare us both the inevitable .
so , wait , it was your decision , not his ?
i don &apos;t wanna talk about it anymore .
i &apos;m sorry . that &apos;s none of my business .
well , the husband &apos;s side of the room
would &apos;ve made felix unger proud .
yeah , well , the wife &apos;s side looks like chernobyl .
so the husband is organized .
he set the itinerary .
they were planning a romantic ,
candlelit dinner on the hotel beach .
if john was so very detailed ,
what threw them off course ?
abduction ?
maybe .
or susie .
just look at the way she packed .
looks like she was ready for anything .
or she &apos;s a hot mess .
trust me , there &apos;s something to all this madness .
she &apos;s spur of the moment .
she &apos;s spontaneous and she could &apos;ve changed the plans .
let &apos;s give monty a call .
hello , angels .
i was just about to drop you a line .
i just spoke to john &apos;s parents ,
who said that he and the missus were complete opposites .
he was ...
neat and she was a slob ?
they said it more eloquently than that , but yes .
any luck on susie &apos;s emails , texts ,
and / or search engines , por favor ?
first off , there &apos;s nothing normal about susie .
her search engine is like a jackson pollock painting :
fashion , gluten @-@ free recipes , waxing secrets ,
&quot; which &apos; survivor &apos; contestant are you ? &quot;
all of these searches are things you can get or have for free .
it just reiterates that they didn &apos;t have very much money .
look , i know you said their credit cards
went dead 36 hours ago ,
but what about any charges out of the norm
before they went to belize ?
ah , there &apos;s some small purchases , here and there ,
some nickel @-@ and @-@ dime stuff for food and water ,
but there is one that &apos;s a little bit more expensive ,
from a place called supernova .
what is that ?
it &apos;s an online company where you can purchase a star .
oh , yeah . i &apos;ve heard of that .
you can give them as gifts
or name them after loved ones .
maybe it was a honeymoon gift .
according to his social media page ,
his love is for astronomy .
he is the president of his local amateur astronomers &apos; association .
nerd city .
which i am a proud member of .
well , if the shoe fits .
monty , did susie buy john a telescope ?
yeah , i was about to get to that :
top @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line , from a local store near their home .
susie was gonna surprise john with a star .
monty , i want you to find the best place for stargazing in belize
and let simmons know .
my guess is that &apos;s where they were last heading
before they went off the grid .
simmons , this is your conscience speaking .
i &apos;m sure glad my conscience is a genius .
you know , there &apos;s seven levels of intelligence
and three types of genius ?
lucky for you , i &apos;m all of the above .
brag much ?
only to my friends ,
and girls i meet at applebee &apos;s happy hour .
low @-@ hanging fruit .
hey , i work 14 hours a day
and live with my grandmother .
fair enough . what do you got for me ?
looks like our honeymooners were going stargazing .
that seems to be everywhere . just look up .
true that , but people from all walks of life
come to stargaze at belize &apos;s world @-@ renowned coral atolls .
i &apos;ll put that on the bucket list .
to get there , they would &apos;ve had to travel by boat
by leaving from banyan bay ,
which means that
they would &apos;ve turned right in a 1 / 2 @-@ mile .
i think i may have found where our couple went offroading .
our vics were driving a red jeep , right ?
yes , sir . it was a part of their honeymoon package .
in pursuit !
of what ?
the evidence .
pull over !
fbi ! don &apos;t move !
monty , give the team my coordinates .
i &apos;m gonna need clara for this .
he &apos;s speaking creole .
so , people from the island ,
they call him and tell him where the junk is .
he goes , he picks it up , sells it as scrap metal .
he was just doing his job .
so why &apos;d he run ?
why ?
&apos;cause i no know you .
he speaks english .
yes . creole is based in english .
man , that is a hell of a dent .
what kind of car rail would cause that ?
none .
this dent was made by a battering ram mounted on a bumper ,
to inflict impact without taking any in return .
and it was hit in the passenger side ,
so they never saw it coming .
it &apos;s a classic blitz attack .
it &apos;s not intended to kill , but to push them off the road .
the method of attack is significant .
these people were taken .
might already be dead .
unless we have a body ,
we have to assume they &apos;re still alive .
move !
no !
move !
i &apos;m not seeing any signs of deception .
he &apos;s making clear eye contact .
he &apos;s using an active voice .
he &apos;s not equivocating or self @-@ minimizing .
and his record is clean ,
so he &apos;s being straight with us .
how do people let you know
about junk around the island ?
he says somebody calls him ,
just like the man who told him about the jeep .
do you know this man ?
the man came into his shop , told him that he was
on his way to go fishing .
and saw a jeep just off the road ,
down in the ravine .
what &apos;d he look like ?
he wore sunglasses and a baseball hat ,
so he didn &apos;t get a great look at his face .
and he was tan and spoke creole ,
so he was definitely local .
i asked him if there was anything else
that he saw , out of the ordinary ,
and he said that he knows fishing
and that man was no fisherman .
so he gets the tow truck driver
to clean up his mess for him
and then contaminate any evidence in the process .
he wasn &apos;t fishing .
no .
he was trying to get rid of something in the bay .
or someone .
tillet , how about we go fishing ?
your hunch was right .
our officers found a bloated body in the bay
about a kilometer from shore .
looks like it was in the water a short time .
is it the husband ?
most of him .
his hands and feet are missing .
应急帐篷
why is this tent in the middle of the beach ?
the guests are seeing this .
it &apos;s causing concerns .
it &apos;s not our intention ,
but this is the scene of a crime .
and , since san pedro doesn &apos;t have a morgue ,
we &apos;re gonna have to do an onsite autopsy .
did you say autopsy ?
what are you thinking , clara ?
you know , removing the hands and feet
are usually used as either a form of punishment
for a crime , such as thievery ,
or as a method of torture .
i mean , sometimes they --
male , 25 to 30 .
unsub knows his way around a blade .
they are not surgical , but they are clean .
marks on the neck ,
torso , and ankles show that the victim
was weighted down in the water ,
probably by fishing line .
open his shirt .
where is his heart ?
the missing heart , along with the hands and feet ,
point to this being an ancient mayan ritual .
which tracks , since belize
was ground zero for mayan culture .
right , but he is not just cutting them off and out .
he &apos;s actually eating them .
it &apos;s an act of dominance .
eating the heart is an effort to absorb
the victim &apos;s strength , while the hands and feet
represent the most extreme ends of the body ,
thus encapsulating the whole being .
knife marks , clean cuts , no hesitations .
so he weighted down the body with weights ,
but , somehow , john got loose .
low tide .
slack water got pulled back out of the ocean
and a current could &apos;ve shaken our db loose
from his watery grave .
appears he &apos;s a mission @-@ oriented ,
anger @-@ excitation killer .
he targeted the davises ,
with the intention to ritualistically kill the husband .
which is in step with the mayan rules
of engagement with other warriors .
his need to remove the hands and feet
is all part of a premeditated delusion .
he &apos;s sadistic , fueled by fantasies .
and , in modeling himself after a traditional mayan warrior ,
the unsub is building confidence
and adding credence to his fantasy .
which , in itself , is a form of association and detachment
that allows him to justify his actions .
his social skills , like with the tow @-@ truck driver ,
suggest that he could be living a normal life ,
probably be employed , mid @-@ 30s .
well , why cut his heart out , then put his shirt back on ?
dressing can be a form of remorse .
but then , that contradicts
the brutality in which he kills .
which then speaks to it being a compulsion
or part of his ritual .
the weighting and the dumping of the body
could be a forensic countermeasure ?
it suggests that he &apos;s done this before .
so , potentially , there are more victims in the water .
we need to drag the bay , asap .
i &apos;m sorry , jack , i don &apos;t have those kind of resources .
well , i do actually . i have an old military buddy
who opened a dive shop down here . i &apos;ll give him a call .
i forgot . you always have a guy .
autopsy notes on two male skeletons pulled out of the bay ,
both missing hands and feet .
i &apos;m all ears .
monty , how &apos;s that security footage from the hotel going ?
nothing yet , but i &apos;m still looking through it .
it &apos;s a couple weeks &apos; worth of security footage .
copy .
i &apos;ve told so many people that they &apos;ve lost loved ones .
it never gets any easier .
and , monty , it never will .
but you help more than you know .
i &apos;m so sorry .
is that my little girl ?
sir , everyone behind the yellow tape here .
mr. cowen .
she in there ?
it &apos;s johnny , not susie .
oh , god .
is she dead , too ?
we don &apos;t know yet .
but she could be ?
what if i never see her again ?
you can &apos;t think like that .
okay , my buddies over at interpol
finally got back to me .
we ran the dna on the two skeletons
that were just dragged out of the bay and we got a hit .
both were males ,
however , we were able to identify one
as anuk michelson , 35 , dutch .
last known photo was taken a week
before he and his new wife , monica , disappeared .
local authorities said , after renting a car ,
they took off on a day trip and never returned .
i remember this .
about a year ago , anuk &apos;s parents
wanted their son to be pronounced dead
so they could claim the insurance policy .
the insurance company performed an investigation
and concluded there was no proof of foul play
or that anuk and his wife were deceased .
they theorized that anuk and his new bride skipped town
to avoid their growing debt .
we accepted the insurance company &apos;s findings .
no body , no crime .
clara , anything come from the interviews ?
all of the hotel guests and employees were clean ,
or at least had solid alibis .
so , both missing couples were honeymooners .
monty , look into anything else that &apos;s happened in that bay
over the last few years .
you got it .
what &apos;s going on here ?
what are you doing to me ?
why am i wearing a wedding dress ?
because we will be married .
what ?
what are you talking about ?
you should want to marry me .
i am strong .
i will protect you .
what did you do to john ?
oh , my god .
the unsub is killing and consuming part of the males ,
but keeping the females alive ,
thus absorbing their strength and their property ,
which was a common warrior practice .
property ?
historically , women were considered
legal possessions that men could leverage
for a variety of reasons .
three dead bodies , all males ,
so why does the unsub feel the need
to keep reasserting his dominance ?
his m.o. is so specific .
it &apos;s doubtful he killed the women in a different way .
which means they &apos;re probably still alive .
so what if he &apos;s taking the dead men &apos;s women as his wives ?
so our unsub is not only a cannibal ,
but also a polygamist ?
mayans were monogamous .
the only practicing polygamists in the area were aztecs .
so this ritual is aztec , not mayan ?
but aztecs were mexican ?
right .
so we &apos;re looking for a mestizo who &apos;s good with a blade
and had access to all of our victims .
papa !
honey !
why this whole aztec thing ?
why does that speak to him ?
regressing to a culture where men were conquerors
has allowed him to find his place in this world .
i want you to meet someone special .
this is susie .
she will be another mommy .
i reached out to my friends at a webpage called
the global missing peoples network .
denise brown of toronto posted
about her daughter trish brown &apos;s
mysterious disappearance 3 years ago in belize ,
失踪日期 2012年10月12日
where she met a boy named colin jackson on a cruise ship
and they eloped .
where were they last seen ?
at the san pedro courthouse .
here &apos;s the last photo they took .
you remember this , tillet ?
we didn &apos;t handle that .
yeah , because trish and colin came in on a cruise ship ,
it fell under maritime law ,
so the belize police department didn &apos;t investigate .
ship security botched the investigation
and eventually filed it with canadian interpol
as a cold case .
so we believe this third body
could possibly belong to colin jackson ?
same height ;
estimated weight , based off bone density ;
makes it more than likely that it is .
now , trish and colin
borrowed denise &apos;s credit card so they could
rent a car for the day , to see the island .
two out of our three couples rented cars .
the other was a hotel @-@ assigned guest car .
simmons , get on the horn .
find out where that hotel gets their cars .
now , i crossreferenced all the dates that our three couples
either went off the grid or were declared missing ,
and they all seem to fall
within the first few weeks of october .
focus on traumatic events occurring in the first part of october .
combine that with information you find out on the bay .
let &apos;s shake something out of this tree .
what have you got ?
okay , i uncovered an event from 3 years ago .
a car accident took place near the bay ,
same location the dead bodies were dumped .
go on .
a tourist couple in belize
on their honeymoon killed a local woman , rosa kiaten ,
when they hit her car directly into the bay .
her body was uncovered by her husband ,
antonio , a local butcher .
if this is the unsub &apos;s wife ,
it explains why he &apos;s so good with a blade .
but this happened on april 21st , not in october .
the death could be a stressor , the foundation of his mania ,
but it could be something else that triggers him .
the aztecs have an elaborate calendar
full of numerous festivals and ceremonies .
october 13th is the day of the jaguar .
aztecs believed that it was a good day to do battle .
monty , we need an address for antonio , asap .
got it . antonio and his wife
shared a place above the family butcher shop .
he &apos;s attacking tourists with a car ,
like the one that killed his wife .
&quot; you took my beloved . now , i take yours . &quot;
it &apos;s mano a mano .
his actions are demonstrating extreme arrogance
and a sense of entitlement .
not just entitlement .
in devouring the flesh of his enemies ,
aztec warriors were embodying their gods .
so , by eating people ,
the aztec warrior becomes a god .
sorry , everyone ,
but i &apos;m going to need to reroute you .
antonio closed the butcher business
soon after his wife &apos;s death and moved .
i &apos;m checking tax records to see where to .
okay . the hotel rental car and both of the other rentals
came from san pedro car rental .
and guess what .
tax documents say antonio started working there 3 years ago .
and rental car companies are independent contractors .
they &apos;re not hotel employees .
that &apos;s why we never interviewed him .
but , working a car rental window
explains how he had access to all the couples .
and how he knew when to attack at their most vulnerable moment ,
because he could gps their every movement .
no !
time for us to all go to a better place .
freeze ! fbi !
there &apos;s no need to do this .
we can keep your family safe .
only i can protect my family .
you think that , by controlling women ,
that , somehow , makes you more of a man ?
real men don &apos;t hurt their families .
they love them . they protect them .
you &apos;re not a man .
you &apos;re just a coward .
shut up !
you &apos;re weak .
you are weak .
no .
i am strong .
i am a god .
you &apos;re not a god .
a god could &apos;ve saved your wife , rosa !
you &apos;re just a fraud !
you &apos;re a fake ! you &apos;re a failure !
no !
they &apos;re still alive .
we need a paramedic .
oh , sweetheart .
daddy .
she okay ?
um , beyond the obvious trauma ,
she &apos;s dehydrated , but , she &apos;ll make it .
the other two women ?
they &apos;ll physically be okay , but ,
stockholm syndrome survivors
tend to have mixed results .
i &apos;m sorry that it got weird between us in the hotel room .
no , i @-@ i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry for being so judgmental .
it &apos;s not judgmental if it &apos;s true .
it &apos;s just that , what we do , it &apos;s so dangerous and scary ,
and it &apos;s made me afraid of any kind of commitment
and i just don &apos;t wanna make someone ...
like me ?
that &apos;s not what i meant .
okay , i would be a liar if i said that
it hadn &apos;t crossed my mind .
look , mae , losing brad , it hurt . it hurt like hell .
but what would &apos;ve hurt even more ?
never having been with him .
