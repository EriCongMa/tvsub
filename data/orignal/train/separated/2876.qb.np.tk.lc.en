phoebe hates pottery barn.i hate pottery barn too .
they kicked me out just because i sat on a bed .
you took off your pants and got under the sheets .
i was tired .
phoebe hates pottery barn ? she hates mass @-@ produced stuff .
she thinks her furniture should have a story behind it .
this has a story behind it.they had to ship it all the way from the white plains store .
it &apos;s got to be one @-@ of @-@ a @-@ kind .
like that god @-@ awful ceramic fruit bowl she has on her counter ?
hey ! i made that for her .
you made pottery ?
yeah .
i made it out of a fruit bowl i found in the garbage .
if you put that in her apartment , you &apos;ll never hear the end of it .
i &apos;ll tell her that it &apos;s an antique.she doesn &apos;t have to know where it came from .
i love these little drawers.oh , look ! it says that it holds 300 cds .
just like the apothecary tables of yore .
your what ?
what ? -what ?
enjoy the catalog , sweetheart .
so the farmer says : &quot; that &apos;s not a cow , and you &apos;re not milking . &quot;
i &apos;m so glad you &apos;re together.we wanted a couple to go out with , and now we have one .
we &apos;re a couple of couples .
i had so much fun tonight . what a great restaurant !
and , chandler , i can &apos;t believe i let you pay for this one .
thanks again , man .
if you come over tomorrow , i &apos;ll make pasta .
that &apos;d be great ! -okay .
but at least let us bring the wine .
you don &apos;t have to .
i insist .
you &apos;ll get the wine , right ?
yeah .
okay , good night .
see you tomorrow .
can &apos;t wait .
how are we going to get out of that one ?
i can &apos;t handle two nights in a row with them .
what &apos;s wrong with them ?
they &apos;re just a little ... blah !
blah ?
well , you know , he &apos;s blah . she &apos;s just ... she &apos;s very loud for such a small person .
they &apos;re my best friends .
are you saying we can &apos;t go out ? because that &apos;d be a problem .
of course we can still hang out with them.just not two nights in a row .
okay ?
i guess.thank you .
i &apos;ll sell my friends and use the money to buy you presents .
what a great table ! where did you get it ?
guess .
a flea market ?
i knew you would get it on the first guess .
isn &apos;t it cool ? it &apos;s an apothecary table .
you can just imagine that this is where ... they kept all their stuff to make potions .
you can almost smell the opium .
almost .
how much was it ? just only 500 bucks .
five hundred bucks at a flea market ?
i thought you meant how much was it ... when it was new , back then .
no
it was at a flea market , so it was like a dollar .
a dollar ?
and 50 ? so it was like one and 50 dollars .
they gave you the old @-@ time pricing .
yeah .
well , what period is it from ? it &apos;s from yore .
like the &quot; days of yore , &quot; you know ?
yes , i do.it &apos;s just perfect . -oh , good .
i bet it has a great story too.did they tell you where it &apos;s from or ... ?
yes , that i know . this is from white plains .
white plains.it sounds like such a magical place .
i &apos;m here . -hi !
oh , my god !
you like it ?
oh , my god !
it &apos;s my new apothecary table !
phoebe will be here any second . she can &apos;t see this .
why not ? she &apos;ll love it . it &apos;s the real thing .
i got it at pottery barn .
i know . i bought the same one .
and if she sees your table , she &apos;ll know i lied .
i said ours was an original .
why ?
because she hates pottery barn.she hates pottery barn ?
she says it &apos;s all mass @-@ produced ... nothing is authentic , and everyone winds up having the same stuff .
so come on ! can we cover this up , please ?
i am not gonna hide it from phoebe .
although i did get some great pottery barn sheets .
i forgot they made sheets ! ya
i still can &apos;t believe she hates pottery barn .
it &apos;s not like she hates you .
yeah , but pottery barn ?
you know what i think ? she &apos;s just weird .
it &apos;s because she &apos;s a twin . twins are weird .
she &apos;s not weird . she likes her stuff to be one @-@ of @-@ a @-@ kind .
you know what &apos;s not one @-@ of @-@ a @-@ kind ? a twin !
let &apos;s turn out the lights and watch the movie .
hey , cool sheet !
you like it ? -you want to know where i got it ?
sure .
at a flea market .
you buy your sheets at a flea market ?
come on , you gotta loosen the purse strings a little .
dinner will be ready in 20 minutes .
here is the wine to bring over tonight .
you were also gonna buy monica flowers ... but you couldn &apos;t , because you paid for dinner last night .
thanks . but it &apos;s just gonna be me tonight .
what happened to janine ?
she &apos;s really sick .
that &apos;s too bad .
yeah , she &apos;s been in there all day .
high fever , nose problem . it &apos;s ...
phlegm , phlegm , phlegm , phlegm , phlegm .
monica ! chandler !
i &apos;m sorry about tonight . i don &apos;t know if joey told you ... but i couldn &apos;t get out of going to this play .
have a great time , huh ?
that &apos;s funny , i saw no phlegm .
oh , no , she really is sick .
then why is she going to a play ?
well , you know , &quot; starve a fever ... go to a play for a cold . &quot;
why is janine not coming over for dinner ?
she didn &apos;t want to hang out with you guys two nights in a row.i &apos;m so sorry .
why doesn &apos;t she want to hang out with us ?
because she thinks that you are blah .
and that you , monica , are too loud.what ? !
what ?
so she just pretended to have a good time ? she was lying to our faces ?
i can &apos;t believe this . who is she to judge us ? we couldn &apos;t have been nicer to her .
and i am not blah . i am a hoot !
come on , please , you guys . don &apos;t be mad .
i &apos;m sure she said it because she was nervous because you &apos;re my best friends .
and it was our first date.plus , she &apos;s really sick .
you said you made that up !
but isn &apos;t the sick thing better than the play thing ?
they &apos;re both good . i generally just go with , &quot; monica &apos;s drunk again . &quot;
come on , please just give her another chance.she &apos;ll come around , i promise .
of course we will.-come on , we gotta make dinner .
okay .
i do not like that woman ! i can hear you !
i am loud !
that &apos;s funny
can you please not put your feet up on my new .. ?
old sheet .
oh , sure .
my apothecary table !
what ?
no !
where did you get this ?
at pottery barn , okay ?
oh , my god ! pottery barn has ripped off the design of our antique !
if they &apos;ve ripped off our table ... ours must be worth much more than one and 50 dollars .
yes
this doesn &apos;t even smell like opium .
it smells like wine , which you spilled .
and thanks for wrecking my sheet .
ross , calm down . i &apos;ll give you the 80 cents .
okay , one more time .
would you like some orange juice ?
perfect decibel .
i know !
what are you guys doing ?
nothing . we &apos;re just talking . you know , blah @-@ blah @-@ blah .
come on , you said you were gonna try .
i came over to invite you to a movie with me and janine .
what do you say ? -i &apos;d like to but
very funny . i don &apos;t know what to do .
i really want you to get along.please come to the movie with us .
you owe me .
we owe you ?
that &apos;s right .
i helped you out in the start of your relationship .
i helped you sneak around for six months.i looked like an idiot .
and i was humiliated.and i only made $ 200 .
we didn &apos;t give you any money .
you don &apos;t think i know that ?
i can &apos;t decide if it goes better by the new chair ... the sahara desk ... or the parker console table .
i didn &apos;t know there was a pottery barn up here .
i know , i went a little crazy .
a little ? your place looks like page 72 of the catalog .
look at that ! the ornamental birdcage ! large .
oh , ross ? be careful . that is very old .
colonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that .
fascinating .
another amazing find !
i bet this has a great story too .
it does.it is a room @-@ separating apparatus from colonial times .
a lot of this stuff is from the colonial times .
what are some other time periods , rachel ?
well , there &apos;s yore .
and , you know , yesteryear .
rachel has such a good eye for this stuff .
ross , if you ever decide to redecorate ... and i think you should
you should ask rachel to help .
he doesn &apos;t need my help .
i think he &apos;s ready to get rid of the .. what &apos;d you call it ?
the &quot; cheap knockoffs and dinosaur junk &quot; ?
really ?
you know , since you have such a great sense of what i need ..
here &apos;s 60 bucks.why don &apos;t you take phoebe down to that colonial flea market and get me some stuff .
i don &apos;t think phoebe wants to come .
i do want to .
she does want to .
she does want to .
yeah !
i &apos;m gonna get my purse .
okay .
hey , can i have all this stuff when she makes you throw it out ?
well , sure , and i &apos;ll show you right where you can put it .
i guess the flea market was just better last time .
well , at least i got these sheets for ross .
look at this . pottery barn .
you know what ? don &apos;t look at it .
seriously , don &apos;t look at it . -look !
there &apos;s the table they stole from us .
oh , those bastards ! let &apos;s go .
that fan kind of looks like ours and the birdcage and ...
wait a second , this is our exact living room !
no , it &apos;s not.come on , ours is totally different .
i mean , we don &apos;t have the ..
we don &apos;t have that lamp .
and that screen is on the other side .
oh , my god . this is where you got all our stuff.pottery barn ! oh , my god !
okay , i did , all right ? i &apos;m sorry .
i wanted this stuff , and i know how you feel about pottery barn .
come on , don &apos;t be mad .
no , but i am mad .
because this stuff is what &apos;s wrong with the world ... and it &apos;s in my living room
and all i can think about is how i don &apos;t have that lamp !
well , then , honey , buy the lamp.we have that 60 bucks from ross .
i can &apos;t ! i can &apos;t ! unless ...
are you saying you &apos;d move out if i didn &apos;t buy that lamp ?
no , i &apos;m not gonna move out !
but are you saying that you would move out if i didn &apos;t buy that lamp ?
yes ! i would so move out .
then i don &apos;t have a choice.i have to buy that lamp !
that &apos;s right .
but at least the apothecary table &apos;s real .
this was great . didn &apos;t everybody have a great time ?
i did . i really did , and i &apos;ve got to say ...
i &apos;m sorry if i was weird after the last time we went out.i guess i was just nervous .
that &apos;s understandable .
don &apos;t worry about it .
so we can go out again ? -absolutely .
well , good.night !
see ? wasn &apos;t that fun ?
we have got to move . what ?
i knew it !
you &apos;re not so quiet yourself , missy !
i &apos;m blah ?
the only thing more boring than modern dance is you talking about it .
&quot; oh , chandler , i just lost myself in the movement . &quot;
you know , i know you &apos;re talking ... but all i hear is , &quot; blah @-@ blah @-@ blah @-@ blah @-@ blah . &quot;
all right , you and me ! let &apos;s go right now !
all right , enough ! enough ! you two , go home . i gotta talk to janine .
i really think you could take her .
you better hope i don &apos;t see you in the hallway !
all right .
look , we got a little bit of a problem here .
you can &apos;t my treat my friends that way .
they said stuff to me too .
i know , i &apos;ll talk to them about it .
they mean so much to me.they &apos;re like my family , you know ?
if you guys are gonna be fighting all the time ....
i don &apos;t think we can be together . it just can &apos;t work , okay ? it can &apos;t .
i &apos;m very upset .
okay.would it help if i apologized ?
yeah.that &apos;d be very helpful .
what did i tell you about the hall ?
i was coming over to apologize for my behavior .
i &apos;d really like it if we could be friends .
well , i know that would make joey happy , so ... i would like that too .
great .
now , come on .
i &apos;m glad we worked it out .
me too .
i &apos;ll see you .
bye .
or i &apos;ll hear you .
that &apos;s it , big girl !
wait !
you &apos;d better run !
did you hear that ?
what am i gonna do ?
i &apos;m sorry , man .
want to go watch ?
yeah !
you know , i &apos;m not sure you could have taken janine .
i could have taken her .
she &apos;s much bigger than you .
are you kidding me ?
i know what to do with tall girls . you go for their knees .
how you doing ?
so did she move out ? pretty much .
i can &apos;t believe you just broke up with her .
when it &apos;s not right , you know it .
you okay ?
i &apos;ll be all right .
you know what would cheer you up ?
what ?
i &apos;m giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night .
i think you should come .
