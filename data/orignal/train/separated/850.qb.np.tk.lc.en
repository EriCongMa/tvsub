i really miss your lips on mine .
babe , it &apos;s just a two month fbi training program .
i had a major breakthrough this week .
i perfected my &quot; keep vamping ,
we &apos;ve almost traced the call &quot; gesture .
oh , wow , really ?
well , you know , we &apos;ve had some breakthroughs
of our own over here , too .
you know , i got to say , your sister
is really coming into her own as a real estate agent .
in fact , i think she may have found a house
for schmidt and cece .
that &apos;s amazing !
oh , thank you so much for looking out for leslie .
it means the world to me .
well , would you describe yourself as , i don &apos;t know ,
owing me ?
&apos;cause i will take my repayment in the form of ...
what the hell is that noise ?
jess ? for pete &apos;s sake .
what is that infernal racket ?
hey , i was just making some table legs .
but if it &apos;s too loud ,
i can table them for later .
this whole summer ,
you &apos;ve been doing one activity after another .
the urban corn harvest .
learning portuguese .
you joined that soulshred gym and got scary ripped .
what is going on with you ?
okay . all right .
she &apos;s a badass , that is what is going on with her .
woodworking is awesome .
okay , woodworking is insane .
it &apos;s woodturning , but go on .
honey , do you think that
any of these hobbies have anything to do with ...
with nick ? nicholas miller ?
that ole turkey burger ?
yeah .
he &apos;s in new orleans with his perfect girlfriend .
and i &apos;m fine .
okay .
actually , i &apos;m doing great .
okay .
i moved past him .
i @-@ i @-@ i &apos;m over him .
just checking .
i &apos;m moving forward .
cool .
or as they say in portuguese ,
empurrando para a frente .
which technically means &quot; thrusting forward . &quot;
it &apos;s a very sexual language .
honey .
we got the house .
we got the house !
leslie , i can &apos;t believe you pulled this off .
every morning i just google &quot; house &quot;
and sometimes stuff comes up .
guys , look at us .
you guys are married .
winston , you &apos;re in love ,
nick &apos;s in a serious relationship of his own ,
and i am a truly excellent friend .
why are you looking at my house ?
hello , sir , how are you ?
we &apos;re the ones who are buying your home .
i &apos;m not selling my house .
what ?
oh , maybe that &apos;s why there &apos;s no sign .
maybe i got the address wrong .
what are you ta-- how did we get into the house ?
we walked through it three times .
what ?
what ? what ?
oh , that &apos;s a mistake .
why would you do that ?
he &apos;s got a bat !
oh , my god , the car &apos;s the other way !
i &apos;m sorry , sir .
all right , i &apos;m taking charge .
winston , leslie has to go .
no !
she &apos;s the worst real estate agent of all time .
aly and i just went long distance .
i can &apos;t tell her that you fired her little sister .
this is a delicate situation for our relationship .
please , jess .
why are you ask ... why are you asking jess ?
and , jess , why are you inserting yourself into this ?
if anyone &apos;s inserting themself , it &apos;s winston .
he &apos;s like a tongue at a seventh grade birthday party .
okay , look , fine , can i at least be the one
to break the news to her ?
yes , you may .
thank you , jess .
it is so great to know
yeah .
who your real friends are .
yeah .
get off the sofa .
yeah .
go check on your cat .
look , we &apos;ll find a place , okay ?
i didn &apos;t like that house that much anyway .
i just can &apos;t be married ,
living with roommates .
well , hey !
well , i hope you saved some for furguson .
&apos;cause you forgot yesterday .
no !
no !
look at our wedding photo .
i want to hang our wedding photo in our house .
i want to start our lives together .
i know .
guys , we are in this together .
we &apos;re just gonna have to find a house ourselves .
i need a project now that my table &apos;s almost done .
i &apos;ll be your real estate agent .
i &apos;ve already found , like , five open houses today .
like , this one is a fixer @-@ upper ,
but don &apos;t judge a house by its smoke damage .
okay , babe , this was a crime scene .
yeah , but that was months ago .
and it was drug thing , so there are no ghosts .
that &apos;s not how ghosts work .
this is in your price range ,
and it &apos;s , like , only five minutes from the loft .
i really think this is the best investment
of our money right now .
okay , okay , okay . okay .
hey , babe ?
i think we got this , okay ?
yes .
we got this .
actually , we , we got this .
preach ! we got this .
jess , look at us for a second , the two of us , cece and i.

we got this .
we got this . all right .
schmidt , bedrooms . cece , bathrooms .

bonjour !
crawdaddy &apos;s home , and he &apos;s ready to see his crawkids !
who &apos;s home ?
schmidty , jess ?
winston ?
winston &apos;s cat ?
fine . cece ?
the en suite is en fleek .
i love this house , too .
i poked my head in the shower .
perfect , gentle , unrelenting pressure .
like when my mom made me rehearse my haftarah portion .
i don &apos;t know , guys .
lot of lost dog posters around .
really sad neighborhood .
also it &apos;s crazy expensive .
i &apos;m the voice of reason ,
that &apos;s why you brought me with .
we didn &apos;t bought you with .
you followed us here in your car .
okay .
she followed us the whole way .
i know , i know .
i &apos;m begging you please . you need to set up some boundaries .
i know .
you know what , though ? she &apos;s not wrong .
this place is way over our borrowing limit .
damn it .
the only place that was even close was that ...
carpet house .
all right . we will ask for a bigger loan .
and it &apos;ll be tight , but we &apos;ll manage it .
okay .
yeah , we can do it .
look , we &apos;ll just make sacrifices .
yeah .
we &apos;ll pack our lunches . we &apos;ll cut out cup @-@ on &apos;s .
it &apos;s coupons .
cup @-@ ons , yeah .
no , you &apos;re saying cup @-@ ons .
well , it &apos;s fine .
it &apos;s not important , we &apos;ll cut out cup @-@ ons .
coupons . but if we &apos;re gonna do this ,
we &apos;re gonna have to go to the bank now
because this house is gonna go like this , i know it .
why is she talking to the realtor ?
i will handle it , okay ?
it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s tot ... it &apos;s ... oh .
jess ?
i &apos;m so sorry , do you mind if i just
steal her away for a minute ? jessica ?
hey , honey , this can &apos;t happen .
you &apos;re right , this is not your house .
toni @-@ anne , we &apos;re walking !
no , no .
you being here .
you taking over as our real estate agent because ...
you can &apos;t stop thinking about nick .
cece , not everything &apos;s about nick .
curvando diante da face errada .
in portuguese ,
&quot; you &apos;re bending before the wrong face . &quot;
again , very sexual language .
you know i love you
and i will always be there for you in an emergency ,
but schmidt and i need to do this by ourselves .
you got to go home .
okay . i got it . okay .
you guys are moving forward ,
you don &apos;t need ol &apos; jess the mess .
i &apos;m gonna go home .
but seriously ,
i crawled under the house and
the retrofitting is rookie work .
okay .
she going home ?
yeah , let &apos;s go to the bank .
let &apos;s do it . you know what , actually ,
i just want to use the cooktop first .
make an egg .
honey , where are you gonna get an egg ?
got two eggs right here . got a pan right here .
think i &apos;m gonna buy a house and not make an egg first ?
and i &apos;m a sagittarius ,
which is why i &apos;m so good with people and horses .
but it also makes me , like , really sleepy .
uh , leslie ...
um , there &apos;s no ...
there &apos;s no easy way to say this .
you ...
no longer work ... for schmidt and cece .
no , no , they &apos;re firing me ?
no , but didn &apos;t you tell them how good i am ?
well , you know , i tried to .
i was like , i was like , &quot; man , she good ... &quot;
you didn &apos;t stick up for me , winston ?
well , i tried ...
i &apos;m calling aly !
no , no , time out , time out . listen .
time out . stop .
stop that . you didn &apos;t let me finish .
you don &apos;t work for schmidt and cece anymore , because ...
&apos;cause you work for me now .
i &apos;m buying a house .
i &apos;m buying a house !
i &apos;m buying a home .
we do not look great on paper .
please , on paper ,
we &apos;re as ugly as winston &apos;s bellybutton ring .
who gets a bellybutton ring if you have an outie ?
and at 33 , no less .
but trust me , loan officers have a lot of discretion .
we just need to market ourselves .
we need to look him right in the eye ...
mr. schmidt and mrs. parikh ?
i &apos;m not blind .
i just had my pupils dilated for an exam .
if it makes you feel any better ,
i &apos;m seeing stars , too .
what ?
i &apos;m talking about you .
okay , honey , just ...
shh .
you &apos;re a big , bright star .
it ain &apos;t gonna be that kind of party today , pal .
follow me .

i see him and my heart explodes .
we all need to meet new people .

but i think nailed the most important one .
that it can float .

and i saw it .
and you thought , &quot; okay . &quot;
