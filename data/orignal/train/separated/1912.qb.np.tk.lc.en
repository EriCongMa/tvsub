&quot; two against one &quot;
glioma ... fibroma ... blastoma .
whatever the tumor , people assume you approach it the same way .
you find its hiding place in the body ,
then open the patient up ...
miranda ... m @-@ miranda , what are you doing ? it &apos;s 4 : 00 a.m.
there &apos;s a ... smell ...
something rotting .
i smell ... nothing .
i know my son . before leaving for his dad &apos;s ,
he left a piece of .... food somewhere .
hey , let &apos;s go back to bed , get some sleep .
tomorrow &apos;s a big day .
you &apos;re going back to your old job .
can &apos;t you do that in your sleep ?
you want me to help you look ?
how can you help if you can &apos;t even smell the smell ?
... and you cut it the hell out .
but you &apos;re not just fighting the one tumor ...
dude , you &apos;re jago .
counter with a wind kick . it &apos;ll take him down .
i can &apos;t concentrate when you watch me .
what are you even doing awake ?
are you worried about your surgery tomorrow ?
nope .
can &apos;t sleep because of the crying baby next door .
and the ... frog and the monkey picture kind of freak me out .
hey , is this level 7 ?
yep . what about you ?
shouldn &apos;t you be resting
before you and dr. grey operate on me tomorrow ?
video games are good for surgical practice . gimme that .
i &apos;ll show you how to beat sabrewulf .
you &apos;re actually at war with over a billion cells ...
combo !
nice .
told you .
dr. grey ?
you wanted me to wake you if , um --
how is it ?
it &apos;s starting to have a shape .
come look .
so there we were , hour four into this messy trauma ,
when i say , &quot; that &apos;s not an adhesion , that &apos;s the ureter . &quot;
you guys -- - shh ! i @-@ i -- i &apos;m telling a story here .
um ... oh , uh , creamer .
you said it to the attending ?
yeah , he blew me off .
he didn &apos;t stop what he was doing
until the chief resident invoked the 2 @-@ challenge rule .
you guys ...
it comes from aviation . say i &apos;m the pilot ,
and you &apos;re my co @-@ pilot .
you disagree with how i &apos;m flying the plane .
okay , you say something , and i fly the plane the same way .
someone else says something , and i don &apos;t acknowledge it .
i lose . i have to give up control .
the 2 @-@ challenge rule .
i mean , the doctors adopted it to the o.r.
edwards , what ? !
we &apos;re 30 minutes away .
finish your rounds .
you &apos;re gonna wanna be in the front row when your life changes .
oh , yeah . i &apos;m ready .
dr. webber , you want to come with us ?
dr. grey says you &apos;re supposed to be up and walking .
uh , no you ... go on down .
uh , but come back ,
&apos;cause you &apos;re gonna wanna hear the end of this story .
everyone knows the end of the story , because you &apos;ve already told it !
maybe you shouldn &apos;t be listening in on conversations
that take place in other people &apos;s rooms , c.j.
not my fault that you work for a hospital with crap @-@ thin walls !
yeah , go take a lap !
i will if you do !
hey , guys !
so i have the results of your compatibility test .
i &apos;m sure we did great .
if we didn &apos;t do great , we &apos;ll just take it again .
i took my boards twice , so it &apos;ll be fine , right ?
april , i &apos;m -- i &apos;m sure we did fine .
i mean , we -- we -- we did fine , right ?
if i hadn &apos;t known you two already ,
i would have thought you cheated .
90 percent . we crushed it !
yes !
she likes to win .
yeah , no , that &apos;s -- that &apos;s good . that &apos;s good .
let me get your exercises for this week .
so ...
listen , um ...
there is one ... problem that we really haven &apos;t ... discussed .
what ?
well , come on , i mean , we &apos;re -- we &apos;re compatible
but we &apos;re certainly not ... equal .
oh , that . yeah .
i @-@ i @-@ i wasn &apos;t sure if that really bothered you .
of course it really bothers me .
well , then we should just fix it .
now ...
before we &apos;re married ?
yeah . i mean , the solution &apos;s simple .
yeah , we just have sex .
get a joint checking account .
sharky , rundown .
i &apos;ve pre @-@ rounded on all of your post @-@ ops
and uploaded yesterday &apos;s notes .
mrs. ott--my aortic ulcer patient ?
uh , echo shows an improving e.f. of 65 % .
nathan glazier-- my h.l.h.s. baby ?
sats fell to 87 . now in the p.i.c.u.
mr. wu--valve repair ?
there is no mr. wu with a valve repair .
very good . here you go .
what &apos;s this for ?
well , you stayed up all night keeping my patients awake
while i got a good night &apos;s rest . so ... coffee .
are you headed downstairs ?
dr. grey &apos;s presenting the 3 @-@ d printer .
oh , you know what ? i &apos;m gonna look at it later .
i @-@ i want to check on the glazier baby &apos;s numbers .
p.i.c.u. , one hour .
so is that my tumor ?
yes , and this is your esophagus , which we will remove .
with a section of your colon from down here .
and part of my ass will now be my throat .
your colon is actually your large intestine ,
and again we &apos;re only gonna take a piece of it .
well , honey , now when you give a restaurant a bad review ,
people can truly say , &quot; you &apos;re talking out of your ass .
when i eat their food ,
i can truly say , &quot; it tastes like crap . &quot;
the food will not taste like crap .
hey , i &apos;m still mad at you for zane &apos;s .
i ate there for ten years
until you ruined it for me .
oh , please , they over @-@ salt everything .
well , barring complications ,
you &apos;ll soon be back to bossing us all around about where we eat .
get another enema .
but he already had one .
which is why i said , &quot; another . &quot;
look , we &apos;re dealing with the most contaminated part of the body .
oh ! can i do it after dr. grey &apos;s presentation ?
i don &apos;t care when you do it
as long as you deliver duncan to the o.r.
with a squeaky clean colon .
so when an opening came up for maternal / fetal surgeon ,
i thought of you first .
so i pitched you to the board .
and they just want one of us
to sit down with you to interview you .
you &apos;ll be meeting with dr. torres .
her resume really speaks for itself .
this is more of a formality .
well , and maybe an opportunity
to learn a little more about the woman you &apos;re dating .
not necessary at all .
so ... anything you can tell me about dr. torres ?
um ... she &apos;s great . i mean , she &apos;s my ex ...
so she &apos;s not that great .
look , i &apos;m sure she &apos;s probably not an ax murderer ,
but if there &apos;s something there , i will give you a heads @-@ up .
please don &apos;t .
just be yourself .
hey .
hi ! um , this is dr. emma marling .
dr. callie torres .
good to meet you .
let &apos;s do this .
dr. avery , mrs. maddox is here to get her drain removed ,
and i &apos;ll do it after the presentation .
i &apos;ll do it myself , murphy .
really ?
because i know the case--
nah , i prefer to do it myself .
thanks .
what , did i miss it ?
you didn &apos;t miss it .
do you think they made a heart ?
mm , steph won &apos;t say ,
but i think a heart &apos;s too complicated .
hey .
a bladder ?
come on . what &apos;d you guys print ?
i &apos;m not saying .
but your minds will be freakin &apos; blown .
hey , how &apos;d the drop @-@ off at day care go ?
tear @-@ free . how &apos;s your new toy ?
well , you &apos;ll have to wait and see like everybody else .
good morning , everyone .
morning .
grey @-@ sloan memorial has always valued innovation as a top priority .
and today , the leader of this charge is dr. grey .
we should all follow her in pushing the boundaries ,
moving medicine forward , finding new ways to innovate .
dr. grey ?
3 @-@ d printing will allow us to customize treatment
for an individual &apos;s specific needs .
instead of ordering and waiting for an implant ...
do you see that ?
we are going to be able to print ...
the printer , yeah , it &apos;s cool .
in @-@ house , on @-@ demand--
no , no , the guy next to her ...
right here . ... - with the eye twitch .
eventually , even using a patient &apos;s own cells to prevent rejection .
welcome to the age of personalized medicine .
a fork ?
oh , no .
technology .
well , at least it isn &apos;t a spork .
you guys , we just got the printer yesterday .
we &apos;re testing it out . forks today ,
tomorrow , portal veins for actual people .
you guys !
oh , if your mother could see you now .
she &apos;d take issue with my hair .
she &apos;d be proud .
did i ever tell you the story
about how i chose my first research project ?
many times . you know , it &apos;s looking a little too comfy in here .
are you getting your laps in ?
you can get one in now .
you can walk me to the elevator . i have a patient to see .
go change the face of medicine .
you need to be doing your laps .
you need to be walking .
another captive runs screaming from your theater of ... boredom .
move along , c.j.
oh , you know , you need some new material ?
i know your entire repertoire by heart .
they &apos;re good stories .
you see ?
even dr. kepner &apos;s heard them multiple times .
you should come take a walk with me . come on .
i &apos;ll tell you some really good stories .
you get a head start . i &apos;ll catch up .
and close your gown . i can see your underwear .
i &apos;m not wearing any .
uh , harvey ?
yes ?
can i help you ?
no , but i think i can help you .
i can fix that . it &apos;ll take about 30 minutes .
fix what ?
the twitch .
i don &apos;t know who you are ,
but frankly this is none of your business .
and it &apos;s not a twitch , it &apos;s a-
a hemifacial spasm .
see i can decompress the nerve .
it &apos;s minimally invasive . it &apos;s barely even a surgery .
who the hell are you ?
he &apos;s derek shepherd--
one of the best neurosurgeons in the country .
i really think you should let him fix it .
and who are you ?
jackson avery-- plastics , e.n.t.
i would really love to observe if that &apos;s cool with you .
no , that &apos;s not cool .
now if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
i haven &apos;t had a thing to eat all morning .
if you don &apos;t eat , i can do it today .
did you hear mer just revolutionized the world of cutlery ?
no , i ... did not .
working on a liver model .
it &apos;s--it &apos;s printing up now .
that &apos;s great .
it is great .
what the hell &apos;s the matter with you two ?
stay out of it .
okay .
thanks for letting me pick up a few shifts .
i appreciate that .
absolutely .
it &apos;s good to have you back .
uh , that &apos;s wrong .
my esophagectomy is supposed to be in o.r. 2 .
sorry , trauma came in this morning ,
and now you &apos;re in ... o.r. 3 .
but i planned for o.r. 2 .
it was set up exactly the way i needed it for my procedure .
o.r. 3 &apos;s identical to o.r. 2 .
good to have you back , ben .
what &apos;s wrong with o.r. 3 ?
is there a smell in there , too ?
there is a smell in tuck &apos;s room ,
and i &apos;m gonna find it .
mr. and mrs. glazier .
did you figure out why nathan &apos;s not getting any better ?
the left side of your son &apos;s heart
can &apos;t effectively pump blood to the rest of his body .
so last week we inserted something
to help divert the blood flow to the right side .
right , you put in the conduit .
is it not working or something ?
the conduit is synthetic .
so in some cases , the body refuses to accept it .
we believe nathan is in the beginning stages of rejection .
we &apos;re running more tests to be sure .
and what happens if he &apos;s rejecting it ?
well , first we treat it with medication .
but worst @-@ case scenario ,
we take it out and put in a new one .
with another synthetic one ,
but won &apos;t he just reject that one , too ?
let &apos;s not get ahead of ourselves just yet .
we &apos;ll let you know as soon as we have more information .
you said you have answers , but you really don &apos;t , do you ?
okay , so then , um , after u.w. ,
you went to the cleveland clinic--
that &apos;s impressive .
under lacy .
and the focus there was on congenital heart disorders .
oh , but then you left after only a year ?
yeah , there were so many great opportunities out here-- in seattle .
really ?
and there were some personal elements at play , too .
i was , uh , going through a divorce .
and we both worked at the clinic ,
and that became untenable ,
it was affecting my work ,
so i made a move .
oh .
no , right , yeah , no , i @-@ i get that .
so then you moved to seattle pres ?
yes . a year as an attending ,
and then running the maternal / fetal department for the last year .
my research ...
was that hard for you ...
to give up your job .
well , your city , to your ex ?
i &apos;ve been trying to wake him .
come on , buddy .
we &apos;ve let you sleep in long enough .
good morning , will .
my big day started out as a nightmare
when a clown came in at dawn ,
asking me if i wanted a balloon animal .
clowns are a peds floor hazard .
are you still going to try to remove all of the tumors today ?
it just seems like it &apos;s a lot to do all at once .
will &apos;s cancer is a very aggressive sarcoma .
it &apos;s an all @-@ or @-@ nothing approach .
we &apos;ve come up with a plan to remove all of them ,
starting with number one .
some will be a snap , but there are a few tricky ones ,
like tumor number eight .
it &apos;s deep in the liver , but we &apos;ll do our best to get it .
we &apos;ll get it .
we &apos;ll try .
um , it &apos;s sort of like trying to get past level six .
you know , there are some , uh , fighters ,
but we need to be really precise .
we will eat all those dots and kill all those ghosts .
she doesn &apos;t play video games .
we &apos;ll see you in the o.r.
what are you doing here ?
oh , i switched with knox .
uh , ben warren .
uh , i don &apos;t know if we met before i left .
oh , oh i was actually at your wedding .
i got you that pizza stone .
we have a pizza stone ?
yeah , i got you , a , uh , a circular clay stone
about 15 inches in diameter .
it &apos;s kind of my standard gift .
yeah , i @-@ i just used-- always used
typical cookie sheet and poked holes in the foil .
oh , well then this will change your life .
the crust that always stick to the edges never get burned .
you can really tell the difference ?
mm @-@ hmm , it &apos;s the way people should be eating .
you broke scrub .
i &apos;m sorry ?
your left hand dropped below the sterile field .
go re @-@ scrub .
i didn &apos;t move my hand ...
yes ...
it did . i saw it .
you want to call me a liar ,
you need to go re @-@ scrub now .
miranda ... you need a minute ?
i need a quiet o.r. so we can begin .
10 blade .
right here .
well , your e.m.g. did confirm that
it is a hemifacial spasm .
so we &apos;ll just get you started on some pre @-@ op tests .
wait , i know i signed the form ,
but how do i know this is gonna work ?
i mean , i &apos;ve already tried botox , muscle relaxers , and ...
you know , you sell more than just 3 @-@ d printers .
correct .
you know ...
i also sell ink cartridges .
no , no , what i mean is that you sell inspiration .
you are the future face of medicine .
don &apos;t you want that face to be twitch @-@ free ?
the surgery will work .
see ? you should listen to him .
he &apos;s a guy in a bathrobe .
i &apos;m dr. richard webber .
i basically trained these two .
you &apos;re in good hands .
right this way .
dr. avery ...
i know you said you removed mrs. maddox &apos;s drain ,
but i &apos;m worried about a seroma .
should i go ahead and ...
no , no , don &apos;t do anything .
i &apos;ll do it myself after surgery .
hey , murphy !
get in here .
you didn &apos;t hear the end of my story . come .
i go to his house , we eat dinner ,
we talk , we watch tv , we talk ...
we kiss , we ... other stuff , and then we stop .
i go home , and it &apos;s hard , you know ,
because it &apos;s not like i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m missing .
i know what i &apos;m missing .
what do i do ?
hmm ? well , okay , hold on .
what exactly are you asking me ?
well ... how do i resist ?
remember when you had that flirtation with intern murphy ,
and then you decided not to take it any further ?
oh . yeah .
um , i took that further .
you had sex ?
yeah .
was it--
awesome .
this is not-- you &apos;re not ...
i have to go away from you now .
ready with tumor number one .
okay , you see that ?
already going great . one down ...
14 to go . i wish we had gotten to him sooner .
he was diagnosed already stage iv .
typical teenager .
he ignored his symptoms ,
didn &apos;t want to ask for help from anyone ...
and now he &apos;s got an abdomen completely covered with tumors .
well , you &apos;re right . he is a typical teenager ,
which means he can beat this .
he &apos;s strong , able to fight . and what &apos;s better ?
what ?
he &apos;s in my o.r.--
in the o.r. of someone standing on the forefront of medicine .
you should print a spoon next .
that way we &apos;ll be able to reach tumor number two .
it is an anatomically correct liver model with a portal vein .
it &apos;s a plastic blob.i &apos;m starving .
can they print food or just utensils ?
when will the model be done ?
10 , maybe 12 hours .
that long ?
it &apos;s life @-@ saving technology , shane .
if you want it faster , page god .
it &apos;s a fake organ . how long for functional items ?
like an actual vascular graft ?
like a pretzel .
oh , here it is--
&quot; biodegradable polymers . &quot;
what are you looking for ?
nothing . it &apos;s just interesting .
printing &apos;s the future .
what &apos;s a typical saturday like for you ?
oh , well , listen ,
i know that the new attendings pull the most call .
so i have no problem working weekends .
oh , yeah , no . i @-@ i &apos;m just-- i &apos;m wondering ...
what you do for fun .
what feeds your soul ?
i , uh , read .
i like to cook . i like movies .
i have a german shepherd mix named lila .
but no kids ...
from your previous marriage ?
well , previous marriage ?
no , i &apos;m just , uh , i &apos;m just--
i &apos;m just sayin &apos; , is , uh ...
is kids something you see down the line in your future ?
do you-- do you want kids ?
i &apos;m sorry . i don &apos;t think you can ask me this legally
in a job interview .
oh , of course not .
of course not . no . you know what ?
forget i asked .
i haven &apos;t given much thought to kids .
please , never mind .
but if i do , or when i do ,
i imagine girls-- two .
i know that they &apos;ll be hell in junior high ,
but , uh ... i grew up with sisters .
aw . nice .
yeah .
just a few more questions .
more ?
hey , how &apos;s , uh ...
how &apos;s it all ... going ?
it &apos;s great .
yeah , we &apos;re-- yeah , we &apos;re making progress .
good .
in japan , they &apos;re 3 @-@ d making conduits
and seeding them with the patient &apos;s cells
before implanting them , taking away the risk of rejection .
uh @-@ huh . yay , japan .
why can &apos;t we do that ?
why can &apos;t we use a 3 @-@ d printer to create
a conduit that nathan &apos;s body would recognize as his own ?
he wouldn &apos;t need surgery after surgery
to keep replacing the failed synthetic one .
it &apos;s brilliant , but the research alone--
i thought you &apos;d say that . here are the japanese studies .
we would need extensive imaging
to see if nathan &apos;s even a candidate .
also covered .
i &apos;ve scheduled a cardiac c.t. and m.r.i.
it &apos;s-- it &apos;s too experimental .
we &apos;d have to file a compassionate release
with the f.d.a. , get approval .
these things take time
that nathan may not have .
if i start the ground work
with the f.d.a ...
then will you consider it ?
sure .
right there .
can we talk ?
hi . yes , can we ?
i want our wedding night to be amazing .
so do i.
and i want our first time to be--
and that &apos;s the thing .
uh , it will be the first time ... for me .
i @-@ i just--i want it to be right .
before we have sex ,
i want us to commit to one another
in the presence of god and--
april ...
i love you .
yeah .
and i am going to love you the rest of my life .
and i think that god knows that .
i think he knows how we feel .
or she .
or she .
well ...
reverend drew did say that we should ...
support ... one another .
so , if--if this is really important to you .
it is really , really important to me .
really ?
okay .
okay ?
hey , those adhesions are stuck to the intestines .
so make sure you &apos;re on the right plane of dissection .
think i &apos;m finally getting through--
dah ! careful !
wilson , if you cut the bowel instead of the adhesion ,
there &apos;ll be spillage ,
all over the man &apos;s abdominal cavity .
right .
you know , just ... just let me do it .
dr. bailey !
i need to feel the tissue myself .
dr. bailey !
what ?
spillage .
irrigation .
dr. bailey .
dr. bailey .
miranda .
more irrigation .
dr. bailey !
miranda .
irrigation , now .
we need to completely wash out the abdomen .
did you completely wash it out ?
i have several times .
i don &apos;t see any stool or contamination .
and we need to get it closed , a.s.a.p.
the hole can cause sepsis , which could drop blood pressure .
vitals are steady . we &apos;re fine .
we still have all the anastomoses .
just concentrate on one thing at a time .
we fix the hole .
then we move on to the next step .
it &apos;s just a routine complication .
that happens .
everything &apos;s under control . we &apos;re good .
you good , miranda ?
3 @-@ 0 vicryl .
are all the materials biocompatible ?
depends on the cartridge .
what happens if you , like ...
you know , pause it ?
start something else ?
you &apos;d be stuck with a hunk of junk .
and then dr. grey would have to start over ,
sending her back a whole day in her research ,
resulting in her desire to murder me .
great .
vertebral artery is tortuous .
see , it &apos;s compressing the facial nerve
which is the source of the twitch .
you wanna do the decompression ?
hell , yeah .
dr. avery ?
trauma &apos;s asking if we can take a look
at a huge facial lac in the i.c.u.
should i do the sutures ?
no , definitely not .
i can handle it .
seriously .
seriously , i &apos;ll be there in an hour .
thank you .
murphy &apos;s not bad , you know .
oh , i know .
it &apos;s just that i &apos;m better .
can i have a pledget , please ?
thank you .
put it to the left , dumbass .
what ?
are you a half @-@ wit ?
i said place it to the left , idiot .
those are things mark sloan used to say
when he thought he was better than you .
are we taking a walk down memory lane now ?
you know , i convinced him to start teaching you .
you &apos;re a full @-@ wit . now you have to start teaching the residents .
hand them the keys .
and let them take it on a joyride ?
i don &apos;t think so .
well , pretty soon they &apos;re gonna be 18 and have their own cars .
let &apos;s teach &apos; em before they get there .
all right , securing the pad with fibrin glue .
you &apos;re gonna need a lot of that , asshat .
all right , i get it . point made .
i know . it &apos;s just so fun .
there she is . number eight .
right smack in the middle of the liver .
let &apos;s skip it .
skip it ? why would we do that ?
we &apos;ll come back to it .
no , we planned this surgery in an order .
we should stick to it .
alex , if we remove the other ones first ,
we &apos;ll have better exposure .
let &apos;s just come back to it .
it &apos;s the hardest one .
if it turns out we can &apos;t remove it ,
what &apos;s the point of even going for the easy ones ?
look , we should try--
i hear what you &apos;re saying ,
but i &apos;m the lead surgeon on this ,
and i &apos;m making the call .
let &apos;s go to number nine .
dr. yang !
p.i.c.u. just paged .
nathan &apos;s definitely in full @-@ blown rejection .
i did it .
did what ?
i spoke to the f.d.a. , filled out the release ,
i just need you to sign it ...
before they can start reviewing it .
ross .
we &apos;re not gonna do it . call them back .
you said you &apos;d consider it if i covered the obstacles .
there are other options . safer options .
we can increase his i.v. steroids ,
start prograf--
no !
none of those are as good as a biological conduit .
i have all the information . we have the printer .
ross .
it &apos;s not our printer .
it &apos;s dr. grey &apos;s printer ,
and she is using it to print now .
so we can &apos;t do it .
i &apos;m sorry .
then i pan @-@ sear them for a few minutes
on both sides until they &apos;re brown .
and ?
and that &apos;s how i make my famous meatballs .
that &apos;s not a story . that &apos;s a recipe .
at least it got you to shut your yap for a hot minute .
eh , it &apos;s useful .
uh , you know , uh , besides ,
it &apos;s better than you speaking about--
c.j. ?
c.j. ?
c.j. ?
c.j.--
c.j. !
c.j. ! i need some help !
c.j.
dr. webber ?
let me take over ...
okay , okay , i got this .
kepner , get a crash cart .
okay , get me one of epi and 300 of amiodarone , now !
on it .
code blue , third floor .
come on , c.j.
code blue , third floor .
callie loved you .
she &apos;s very nice .
very thorough , but very nice .
how long have you two been divorced ?
um , well , i don &apos;t-- i don &apos;t think that we are .
w @-@ we &apos;re sort of separated , i @-@ i guess .
ah , you still have the ring .
but you &apos;re seeing other people , obviously .
um , yeah . we are .
i &apos;m so sorry . that was way too personal .
i just out of a job interview
that was more intimate than most rectal exams .
i &apos;m just not used to it .
uh , we don &apos;t do things like this at seattle pres .
well , then , come work here .
because we do way too personal on a daily basis .
we &apos;ll isolate the vessels ,
then take the tumor out under direct vision .
i can do it .
i don &apos;t know if you can , mer .
it might be better just to close him .
well , if we don &apos;t resect it , the cancer will only spread ,
and it &apos;ll eliminate his chances of beating this thing .
how do you get it without taking the entire liver ?
dr. grey ,
i just wanted to show you the latest on the liver model .
not now .
edwards , scrub in .
we &apos;re gonna need your help retracting .
alex , he &apos;s 15 .
i think we need to be as aggressive as we can .
clamp .
that &apos;s the last of the reconstruction , right ?
that &apos;s right . ben , can we get a methylene blue test ?
coming right up .
wilson , watch closely . if there &apos;s blue--
there &apos;s a leak , on it .
no blue .
nice work , you guys .
let &apos;s also get a bubble test .
do we need both ?
we need to be absolutely sure that there &apos;s no leak .
if there &apos;s a breakdown somewhere in the anastomosis ,
then bacteria can seep through , going god knows where ,
causing a potential fatal infection .
is that what you want for the patient , wilson ?
no , ma &apos;am .
you know , bubble test only takes a second .
so , uh , wilson , as i inject air into the n.g. tube ,
submerge his chest with saline .
okay .
no bubble . should we start to close ?
we &apos;re not closing . there &apos;s a leak .
there &apos;s a leak .
i see a small bubble , so there &apos;s a leak .
we &apos;ll patch it .
a bubble ? i don &apos;t see anything .
it &apos;s there .
dr. warren ?
um , you know , i ...
didn &apos;t have a very good angle from over here ,
but i trust dr. bailey if she saw a bubble .
might as well put a patch on to be safe .
we &apos;ll oversew it and cover it with a muscle flap .
suction . scissors .
uh , harvey , are--are you okay ?
i &apos;m waiting for it to twitch .
it &apos;s twitched for 20 years .
you can wait all you want , but it &apos;s gone .
we got it .
thank you .
who do you wanna see first ?
the facial lac or mrs. maddox ?
i &apos;ll take &apos; em both .
okay , i will take mrs. maddox ,
and you can take the facial lac .
you know what ? why don &apos;t-- why don &apos;t you take &apos; em both ?
dr. avery , i will not disappoint you .
how you holding up ?
i &apos;m exhausted .
you should &apos;ve let me do the c.p.r.
no , no , it &apos;s a ... good exhausted .
i &apos;ve been stuck in this bed ,
reminiscing about my old life ,
trying to feel like my--myself again .
and now i wanna be myself again .
ready to get back to my feet and ...
be the doctor i used to be .
i lost myself there for a while , kepner .
but now i &apos;m ready to get myself back .
he &apos;s in florid heart failure .
his e.f. is falling precipitously .
it &apos;s the hospital &apos;s printer .
you taught me to take what i need for my patient .
we can &apos;t . not this time .
i looked at dr. grey &apos;s research . she still has months to go
before printing a portal vein that will actually go
into a human patient .
but this ? building a scaffold seated with cells ,
we can do this . this baby can be saved today .
i know , shane . you think i don &apos;t know this ?
now set up for a pericardiocentesis
and do a repeat echo in an hour .
mer , you have to stop now .
i &apos;m about to do the trisegmentectomy--
any further , you &apos;re gonna move into segment two and three .
and it will be fine !
there won &apos;t be enough functioning liver to support this kid .
i think it will , and i will stop before i &apos;m too deep .
you print one damn fork , and now you think
you &apos;re moses or something .
alex , i am in the middle of dividing this kid &apos;s liver .
and i need this conversation to be over !
oh , you gonna pull rank on me again ?
is that how the decision &apos;s made ?
you could 2 @-@ challenge rule .
what ?
dr. webber told us about the 2 @-@ challenge rule
where two surgeons who agree can force a third surgeon
to stand down from a course of action .
okay , fine .
so , dr. edwards , you and i challenge
dr. karev to relax and let me finish .
no , i &apos;m challenging you , mer .
i &apos;m asking you to stop what you &apos;re doing .
edwards ?
dr. grey ... i think you &apos;re amazing .
and you made a beautiful fork ,
and i am so grateful to have been a part of that .
but right now i do think you &apos;re pushing it .
and i have to second dr. karev &apos;s challenge .
dr. karev , you can close .
so robbins says everybody loves you .
i can &apos;t work here .
what ?
these people are great . they &apos;re incredibly nice
and overly kind and a little nosy ,
but great .
but they &apos;re your people , and they love you .
and they care about you .
and they &apos;ll close ranks around you .
they &apos;ll ...
uh , look , i worked with my husband ,
and when our marriage fell apart ...
if something happens to us ,
if we broke up , they would all choose you .
and they &apos;d want my ...
blood .
i would just be the bitch that broke your heart .
are you ...
are you planning to break my heart ?
no , but ...
so don &apos;t do it .
take the job .
owen , i can &apos;t .
i can &apos;t risk it .
hey , you don &apos;t do it either .
do what ?
break my heart .
so ... what does that mean ? another surgery ?
more chemo and radiation ?
it means more time on the peds floor .
yeah , it--it sucks .
um , but , you know , while you &apos;re here ,
we &apos;ll get some things from home .
you know , extend visiting hours
so , uh , your friends can hang out .
and , uh , look , i &apos;ll--i &apos;ll make sure ...
that , uh , no one rounds on you before 11 : 00 .
no more peds stuff .
deal ?
deal .
sorry about what happened in the o.r.
but we made the right decision .
i could &apos;ve gotten that tumor .
nobody could &apos;ve gotten that tumor .
i could have .
mer , i need to talk to you .
i need a minute .
it &apos;s about a patient of mine .
well , i &apos;m talking about a patient of mine right now ,
so i need a minute .
i @-@ i need the printer .
it &apos;s my printer , cristina .
no , it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s the hospital &apos;s printer , and--
which i got for them for my research ,
for my grant .
which is important research , but at this point ,
it &apos;s research , meredith .
and what i &apos;m talking about could save a life .
i can &apos;t stop it in the middle .
it will completely destroy the model .
just because i printed a fork
does not mean my research is a joke .
no one said it was a joke .
but see , i could--i could print a scaffolding
and--and make a biological conduit
for a baby &apos;s heart .
they &apos;re not even doing that yet .
they are in japan .
so if i get compassionate release--
i don &apos;t have time to argue .
submit a proposal to the board
if you wanna use the printer .
it &apos;s time @-@ sensitive , meredith .
well , then you better get to work .
so that &apos;s what it was about in there ?
you and yang ?
she calls you a lousy doctor ,
and suddenly you have something to prove ?
that is not what this is about .
oh , so y @-@ you take it out on my patient .
i did not take it out on your patient .
look , you need to be told you &apos;re good ?
fine , mer . you &apos;re good .
but yang was right . you &apos;re a lousy doctor today .
torres !
come walk with me .
looking good , sir .
feeling good .
you hear i saved the patient in the room next door to me ?
i heard there was a code . that was you ?
let me tell you all about it .
i was talking to a patient ...
uh , come in .
i love you , matthew .
i love you , too .
i lost myself last year .
and i worked really hard to get back to who i was .
the fact that i stumbled in my faith ...
it matters ... to me .
but it just , it feels so good to be back to who i was
and to have found someone who shares that faith .
and , matthew , i love you , and i respect you too much
for you to let that go .
and ... it &apos;s still gonna be a first time for me ,
because it &apos;s gonna be my first time with you .
oh , it &apos;s gonna be amazing .
if we have sex tonight , the only thing that will change
is that you will have broken a promise ,
and i know how that feels .
so ...
we &apos;re waiting .
we &apos;re waiting .
you know , we can lean on each other for support .
okay .
okay .
all right , but , uh ,
maybe we shouldn &apos;t actually lean on each other .
you coming in here ?
yeah , in , uh , one minute .
so how do you beat the odds
when it &apos;s one against a billion ?
i changed our plan on you .
and it &apos;ll--it &apos;ll take time to figure out our new plan .
but , miranda , i @-@ i &apos;m glad i &apos;m home ,
because something &apos;s clearly going on .
between the checking and re @-@ checking the drawers ,
and pulling at your fingertips ?
you need help .
what happened today in that o.r. ,
you and i both know that there was no bubble .
uh , there was a smell .
look , apple slices .
probably with peanut butter on them at one point .
i found them in tuck &apos;s soccer bag ,
and he hasn &apos;t been to soccer in weeks .
so , you know , god knows how long
they &apos;ve been rotting in there .
miranda , i ...
everything &apos;s fine .
you stand strong ,
keep pushing yourself past all rational limits ...
and never let yourself give up .
hey ! how &apos;d the surgery go ?
i could have gotten number eight .
would you believe me if i told you that
i could have gotten number eight ?
of course .
you wouldn &apos;t say you could if you couldn &apos;t .
now would it cheer you up
if i told you i changed the face
of the face of the 3 @-@ d printer ?
no , because i &apos;ll miss his twitch .
you know what this is ?
yes , it &apos;s a fork .
no , it &apos;s the future .
go watch your liver model . i &apos;m gonna put the kids down .
but the truth of the matter is ...
what the hell are you doing ?
despite how hard you try ...
and fight to stay in control ...
when it &apos;s all said and done ...
