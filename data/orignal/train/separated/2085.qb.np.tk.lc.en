you &apos;re gonna tell us everything .
but you were born there , weren &apos;t you ?
every terrorist cell you and victor helped arm ,
every supplier you &apos;ve worked with ,
all your trafficking associates ,
everyone you &apos;ve ever sold weapons to .
chasing my brother and i around the world for five years ,
like a little doggy looking for a bone .
you don &apos;t think we &apos;d do our homework on you ?

i appreciate the compliment .
are you smart enough ?

we don &apos;t negotiate with terrorists .

honolulu approach . reach 717 .
level at 3,000 .
717 , turn left
zero @-@ one @-@ zero , maintain 3,000
until established on approach .
how long since you &apos;ve been home ?
it &apos;s been a while .
sir , i &apos;ve got a call coming in for you
from the governor of hawaii .
commander ?
governor .
thanks for agreeing to see me .
i am so sorry about your loss .
is this about the investigation ?
yes . we have alerts across all the islands .
you won &apos;t find victor hesse
with roadblocks and search warrants .
he &apos;s gone underground until he can find
a safe way to leave the island .
now why am i here ?
i &apos;d like to help you get what you came back here for .
let &apos;s walk .
your father &apos;s death was a wake @-@ up call
to me and every law enforcement agency in hawaii ,
which is why i &apos;m putting together a task force ,
and i want you to run it .
you don &apos;t even know me .
i know your resume .
annapolis .
five years , naval intelligence .
six with the seals .
your superiors say that you are the best
that they have ever seen .
let me stop you right there .
i &apos;ve been tracking victor hesse for five years .
if he was bold enough to surface ,
i promise you he already has an exit strategy planned ,
and he knows i know it , which means ,
i can barely afford the hour it &apos;s gonna take to bury my father ,
let alone stand here talking to you .
excuse me .
i can help you find this son of a bitch ,
wth full immunity and means .
your task force will have full blanket authority
to go after guys like hesse
and get them the hell off my island .
your rules , my backing , no red tape .
and i promise you , commander ,
what you see with me is what you get .
here &apos;s what i see .
an election year coming up ,
and a politician who needs the pr ,
who &apos;s willing to do whatever it takes--
including bringing me down here to pearl harbor ,
where my grandfather was killed ,
so i might feel some kind of obligation
to fulfill my family destiny .
is that about right , governor ?
none of those things make me feel less responsible .
i knew your father , commander .
this is personal for me , too .
pass .
all right .
here &apos;s my private number .
please think it over .
thanks .
she &apos;s a smart lady , that one .
steve mcgarrett , right ?
i know you .
you &apos;d better . chin ho kelly .
oh . chin ho kelly .
kahuku high school .
you were a great quarterback .
oh , that &apos;s very kind of you to say ,
considering you were the one that broke all my records .
oh , that was a long time ago .
i heard you became a cop .
i worked with your father in the seventh .
he taught me everything i know about wearing a badge .
looks like you moved on to greener pasture .
well , let &apos;s just say , the honolulu pd and i had a disagreement
over my job description .
but your father understood .
he was very good to me after i was let go .
he stayed my friend , and i know that cost him something .
i only wish there was some way i could pay him back .
but now that you &apos;re here , maybe you can do something .
what do you mean ?
i hear , the chief of police put a haole
on your father &apos;s murder investigation .
word is , he &apos;s fresh meat from the mainland ,
which means he has no clue how this island works .
no , it &apos;s perfect .
but i &apos;ve been on hold so long , i forgot who i was talking to .
i need a warrant write @-@ up for a surveillance wire
on a suspect in connection to the john mcgarrett murder .
suspects name is doran . fred doran .
d @-@ o @-@ r @-@ a @-@ n .
yeah , that &apos;s terrific . thank you .
hi , daddy .
thank you . it was a good hug .
who , uh ... who &apos;s that ?
mr. hoppy . stan bought him for me
for the animal show @-@ and @-@ tell .
oh , good old step stan .
he &apos;s very cute .
not as cute as you , though .
we &apos;d better go .
we don &apos;t want mr. hoppy
to be late for his first day of school , do we ?
no .
that &apos;s right . all right .
where are you going ? you driving ?
hmm . come on , let &apos;s go this way .
you want to drive ?
you can &apos;t drive . you &apos;re too little .
let &apos;s go . you &apos;re making me dizzy . come on .
hey , look at ... what &apos;s that ?
okay . what are you doing ? what are you looking at over there ?
let &apos;s go . we got to go .
we &apos;re gonna be late for school .
i love you , son .
listen to me , champ ...
i can &apos;t continue this investigation
into the police department from the inside .
i don &apos;t trust the people i work with .
so i &apos;m gonna have to do this on my own .
it &apos;s all about the key .
i just don &apos;t know what it &apos;s for .
i have only been able to find two source ...
you ! hands up ! don &apos;t move !
who are you ?
who are you ?
i am detective danny williams ...
lieutenant commander steve mcgarrett !
this is my father &apos;s house .
put your weapon down right now .
show me your i.d. !
you show me your i.d. ! right now !
i &apos;m not putting my gun down .
neither am i.
use your free hand , take out your i.d.
please , after you .
at the same time ?
at the same time ?
yeah , at the same time .
what , like , on the count of three ?
sure . okay , three &apos;s good .
one ...
two ...
three .
listen , uh ,
i &apos;m really sorry about your father ,
but you can &apos;t be here right now .
this is an active crime scene .
doesn &apos;t seem that active .
i can &apos;t share any information with you .
hesse wasn &apos;t here alone when my father was murdered .
someone was sitting at the desk in the study .
there was a space clear for a 13 @-@ inch laptop
and my father hated computers .
i &apos;m gonna ask you again . you got to leave .
you got it .
and you can leave the box . that is evidence .
you know that .
i came with this .
no , you didn &apos;t come with it .
i see the dust void it left
right here on the counter . what &apos;s in the box ?
how long you been with the honolulu pd ?
none of your business . what are you , barbara walters ?
no , it is my business if you &apos;re investigating my father &apos;s death .
i am , and i &apos;d like to get back to that , so the sooner you leave ,
the sooner i can .
anything you say .
leave the box or get arrested ,
all right ?
you gonna call for backup ?
an ambulance .
thank you .
don &apos;t thank me yet .
what are you doing ?
uh , yeah , governor jameson , please ?
tell her it &apos;s steve mcgarrett .
oh , please .
commander , governor jameson here .
what can i do for you ?
governor , i &apos;ll take the job .
well , let &apos;s just say i found something
that changed my mind .
no , no , no , immediately .
i &apos;ll transfer to the reserves ,
and i &apos;ll run your task force .
wha ... what , right now ?
okay .
i , steven j. mcgarrett ,
do solemnly declare upon my honor and conscience
that i will act at all times
to the best of my ability and knowledge
in a manner befitting an officer of the law . &quot;
thank you , governor .
now it &apos;s my crime scene .
i swung by your precinct , spoke to your captain .
he said you requested a wire
be put on someone named fred doran .
tell me about it .
come in .
this your kid ?
yeah , that &apos;s stunning detective work .
you don &apos;t actually let her ... stay here with you , do you ?
what are you , uh , nanny 911 ?
so , what do you know about this guy ... doran ?
oh , but surely , you don &apos;t need my help , right ?
enlighten me .
he &apos;s a suspected arms dealer .
two years maui correctional for weapons possession .
he &apos;s currently a person of interest
in an unrelated homicide .
the weapon was never found .
so , what &apos;s he got to do with my father &apos;s case ?
when i ran a ballistics comparison
to the bullet that killed your dad ,
i got a hit to the doran investigation .
see , i think the first thing
that hesse did when he got on the island
was hook up with doran and get a gun .
and maybe doran still knows where he is ,
so let &apos;s go talk to him .
whoa , whoa , whoa . excuse me .
are you suffering from dementia ?
this is no longer my case .
the captain said you transferred in from new jersey
six months ago , so your eye &apos;s still fresh .
you know , i appreciate it ,
but my psych eval &apos;s not for six weeks .
fold @-@ out bed , no ring on your finger .
you obviously moved here to be close to your daughter .
which means in between visits , all you got
is your job and you take pride in it .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m looking for .
yeah , but you know what ?
it &apos;s guys like you , they think they know how
to do everything better , and that only makes my job harder .
you got no choice , detective .
governor gave me jurisdiction . i &apos;m making you my partner .
we &apos;re gonna get along great .
i take it your marriage didn &apos;t end too well .
no .
it would have had my ex not remarried
and dragged my daughter to this pineapple @-@ infested hellhole .
you don &apos;t like the beach ?
i don &apos;t like the beach .
who doesn &apos;t like the beach ?
i like , uh , cities , you know .
skyscrapers ,
no tsunamis , no jellyfish .
tell me you can swim .
can i swim ?
you don &apos;t know how to swim .
i know how ... i swim-- i swim for survival , not for fun .
all right .
yes , dear ?
hey , monkey .
no , no , no ,
i thought you were your mom .
i am so glad that everybody liked mr. hoppy .
i &apos;m excited too , baby .
we &apos;re gonna have so much fun this weekend .
danno loves you .
who &apos;s danno ?
don &apos;t .
just ...
okay .
thank you .
this guy doran &apos;s a shooter , all right ?
we shouldn &apos;t be doing this without backup .
you are the backup .
i &apos;m the backup .
i hate him . i hate him so much .
hey . hey , slow down , huh ?
you ruined my life !
you know what , you need to be quiet . sit down !
get your ass back here !
tracy ? tracy ?
danny ! go ! go ! go !
put your gun down ! we don &apos;t have to do this , man .
i said put the gun down !
you sold a weapon to a man named victor hesse .
i &apos;m not after you . i want him .
i &apos;m not talking to you !
where is he ?
i said i &apos;m not talking to you !
now put the gun down , or i &apos;ll kill her !
you don &apos;t think i &apos;ll do it ?
i &apos;ll do it !
i &apos;ll kill her right now !
i hope it hurts !
careful , she bites .
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s okay . what &apos;s your name ?
okay , so she was smuggled in four days ago
in a cargo ship from china ,
with her parents , a couple hundred refugees .
she gets here , she &apos;s traded to doran .
okay , excuse me , i &apos;m sorry ,
this is typically where you would , uh ,
say &quot; thank you &quot; for saving your life .
you just shot my only lead .
are you kidding me ?
are you kidding me ?
these are the same guys
that are moving people out of asia .
they could &apos;ve smuggled hesse into hawaii .
you just took a stupid risk , okay ?
understand that .
i am not getting myself killed
for your vendetta .
i have a daughter , okay ?
yeah , that girl there is someone &apos;s daughter , too .
you don &apos;t get it . you don &apos;t get it .
i mean , for somebody who just lost his father ,
you &apos;re pretty dense .
what &apos;d you just say ?
what &apos;d you just say to me ! what if she was yours , huh ?
is there anything that you
would not do to hunt down the son of a bitch
that did that to her and killed her ?
do not question my resolve ...
one warning . take your finger out of my face .
listen to me , you son of a bitch !
aah ! what did i tell you ?
i warned you .
what are you , a ninja ? let go .
in front of all these nice people . it &apos;s fine .
go back to work . it &apos;s fine .
now , you don &apos;t have to like me ,
but right now , there &apos;s no one else to do this job .
okay . let me go .
all right , look , we need to find these human trafficker ...
you &apos;re right , i don &apos;t like you .
son of a ...
how &apos;s the arm ?
let &apos;s just not talk .
you mean right now or ever again ?
just both , okay ?
you know , i think ... i think i might know why
your wife left you .
really ?
yeah , you &apos;re very sensitive .
i &apos;m sensitive , huh ? yeah .
you think i &apos;m sensitive ?
well , a little bit , you know .
when did you come to the conclusion that i was sensitive , huh ?
was it when a bullet was tearing through my flesh ,
is that when i seemed sensitive to you ?
huh ? i am really happy
that you are not afraid of anything . okay ?
i &apos;m glad that you have that gi joe
thousand @-@ yard stare
from chasing shoe @-@ bombers around the world , okay ?
but in civilized society , we have rules , all right ?
it is the unspoken glue
that separates us from jackals and hyenas ,
all right ?
jackals and hyenas .
animal planet , whatever .
okay ? the point is ,
rule number one :
if you get somebody shot , you apologize !
i &apos;m sorry .
you don &apos;t wait for a special occasion .
i &apos;m sorry . okay ?
like birthdays ,
i &apos;m sorry .
frickin &apos; president &apos;s day ...
hey , man , i &apos;m sorry , okay ?
i said i &apos;m sorry , sincerely sorry .
that &apos;s what i was trying to tell you last year
when this conversation first started .
your , uh ... apology is noted .
acceptance is pending .
you let me know , now .
yeah . i &apos;ll let you know .
make the next left up here .
why ?
i think i know someone who can help us .
her name is chen @-@ chi .
where &apos;d you find her ?
locked in a house .
she came here to start a new life .
they drugged her and turned her into a prostitute .
the guy we &apos;re looking for is high @-@ profile : victor hesse .
cia , fbi , interpol-- he &apos;s on everyone &apos;s radar .
which means he didn &apos;t just land here
and get his passport stamped-- he was back @-@ channeled in .
mm . and you think the same network
that brought this girl to the island smuggled hesse in .
well , he made a fortune trafficking kids out of malaysia , so ...
then you &apos;re looking for a snakehead .
local chinese gangs that specialize in human smuggling .
okay , we need a name .
are you kidding ? look at me .
i &apos;m a rubber gun now .
come on , you were on the force for 15 years .
okay , look , i know a guy who &apos;s got ties to that world .
great . get us an intro .
forget it .
he &apos;s a former confidential informant .
he trusts no one .
especially haoles .
you talk to him , then .
i &apos;m busy .
you &apos;re busy ? what , you expecting
a crime wave in the gift shop this afternoon ?
look ... i can &apos;t be a cop anymore .
why not ?
because i can &apos;t be !
you understand ?
hpd accused me of taking payoffs .
so i &apos;m the last person the department wants to see
wearing a badge .
i got to go .
this is going really well .
did you take the money ?
excuse me ?
did you ...
take the money ?
no .
then come with us ...
and we don &apos;t need to talk about this again .
ever .
this is your ticket back into the game .
call it payback , call it whatever you want ,
i don &apos;t care , but i need you .
how do you know you can trust me ?
because my old man did .
hey , kamekona !
how &apos;s it ... ?
good to see you , my brother .
hey , bro .
i need a name .
hey , wait out there .
after they pay .
two cones , two t @-@ shirts to go .
medium .
x @-@ l and up , brah .
my face don &apos;t fit on anything smaller .
how much kala , bulleh ?
you speak bird , huh ?
yeah , i grew up here .
don &apos;t matter , you still look hauli to me .
this one feels a little bit lonely , brah .
cool !
one more thing-- i need you two fine
white gentlemens to do .
are you a cop ?
no .
well , you look like a cop .
you like cotton candy ? go find your mom .
i don &apos;t like cotton candy .
i got something you might like , okay ?
how about ...
how about that ?
yeah .
thanks .
you &apos;re welcome .
what ?
you &apos;d better have a name .
sang min .
came here from china eight years ago ,
and according to my man kamekona ,
he runs the island &apos;s human import / export business .
so hesse could &apos;ve used him to get on or off the island .
so let &apos;s say this guy &apos;s for real .
still got no reason to tell us where hesse is .
well , we find some leverage , twist his arm .
define leverage .
simple bait @-@ and @-@ trap .
wire up an undercover ,
send him in .
only one problem , malihini .
that might work well on the mainland ,
but we &apos;re on an island with less than a million people .
which means the bad guys know the good guys .
so we need to look for our bait outside the box .
i take it you have the perfect guy in mind ?
oh , yeah .
that &apos;s your cousin ?
choose your next words carefully ,
both of you .
well , she &apos;s very talented .
oh , she &apos;s off the charts .
spent three years on the pro circuit before
she blew out her knee .
the kid was devastated .
had to reinvent herself , and decided to wear a badge .
graduates from the police academy in a week .
unfortunately , she &apos;s family ,
which means the hpd will never take her seriously .
hey ! watch out !
you sure she &apos;s ready for this ?
she &apos;s got no street experience .
ho , brah .
think twice next time you want to drop in on someone &apos;s wave .
cousin !
oh , you had him ,
water woman !
double @-@ overheads .
waste . first good pipe of the season .
tourists-- what you gonna do ?
kono , meet commander steve mcgarrett
and detective danny williams .
nice right cross .
nah , man , that was a love tap .
hi .
that &apos;s good , brah .
sure .
so , your cousin tells us
you &apos;re graduating from the police academy next week .
how &apos;d you like to earn a little extra credit before you do ?
i &apos;m listening .
just spoke to chin-- he &apos;s setting up the meet with sang min .
i got that surveillance equipment you asked for .
you recognize this guy ?
no . who is it ?
jovan etienne .
file says he worked for the russians
as a computer programmer in svr .
he was here when my father was murdered .
i found his palm prints
in the study , partial boot prints in here .
wait a minute , how do you know
the boot print didn &apos;t belong to hesse ?
hesse wears a size 11 , like me , except double @-@ e.
the prints i found were smaller ,
and hesse gets his footwear custom @-@ made .
direct @-@ injected polyurethane mid @-@ sole
with a nitrile rubber outsole .
oh .
your , uh , brain must be a ...
miserable place .
i need a beer .
you ever gonna tell me what danno means ?
yeah , when you tell me what &apos;s in the box .
truth is , i don &apos;t know yet .
all i know ...
is that my father wanted me to find it .
right now it &apos;s just a puzzle .
you know , me and grace , we like puzzles .
you &apos;re a good father .
yeah , maybe , i don &apos;t know . you know ?
there &apos;s three ways of looking at it . one ...
could get myself killed chasing some meth @-@ head scumbag ,
and then what kind of father would i be ?
i always looked up to my father for that .
you know , the sacrifices he made .
i &apos;m sure grace is gonna feel the same way .
yeah , maybe .
either that , or she may think
i &apos;m just a selfish son of a bitch .
you know , the truth is , this is all i got , i need this .
i want to do what i &apos;m good at ,
i want to be reminded i &apos;m good at what i do .
if that means ... having to put up
with your twisted belief that you are never wrong ,
so be it .
so what &apos;s the third ?
well , even if i tell myself this isn &apos;t permanent ...
... it &apos;s gracie &apos;s home now .
it &apos;s my job to keep it safe .
yeah ?
all right .
good work .
what do you got ?
that was chin .
sang min bought the pitch and meets kono tomorrow morning .
all right , still no guarantee he &apos;s gonna tell us where hesse is .
he has to .
this is the only chance i have
of finding the man who killed my father .
all right , guys , kono &apos;s in play .
here we go .
okay , kid , just get him to say how
he &apos;s smuggling these people off the island .
my friend says you need my help .
i have an aunt and uncle in nanjing .
they would very much like to live here .
i can have your family here within a week .
getting them out of china &apos;s easy .
paying for it , that &apos;s the hard part .
i have money .
do you mind if i ask what you do ?
i work at the cannery on pacific ...
and weekends as a housekeeper at the royal hawaiian .
two jobs ?
very commendable .
only i &apos;m afraid the kind of money we &apos;re talking about
might be out of your reach .
unless , of course ,
we find some other form of payment .
sand .
what kind of person working two jobs
has time to go to the beach ?
all right , that &apos;s it . pull the plug .
let &apos;s get her out of there .
relax . the kid can handle herself .
hey , he smells trap ,
he &apos;s gonna kill her , all right ?
trust me .
i surf during my lunch hour .
or maybe you &apos;re a cop .
did anyone check her for a wire ?
we checked her when she came in .
maybe you missed it .
take off your dress so i know you &apos;re not wearing a wire .
turn around .
i &apos;d like to put my dress back on now .
what are ... ? what are you doing ?
i &apos;m going to send this photo to a friend of mine .
okay , we got a wire on that phone .
trace the call , danny .
and he &apos;s going to show it to his friends .
if anyone recognizes you ...
mobile number . unlisted .
... you &apos;re dead .
got a location ?
danny ?
ringing inside my precinct .
you got a mole in there .
she &apos;s a cop .
we got to move .
you &apos;re early .
you all right ?
down ! down on the floor ! now ! down !
put your hands behind your back .
hey ! let me see your hands !

keep your hands on the steering wheel .
out of the car right now .
hands behind your head .
we &apos;re clear .
we got movement over here .
go ahead .
go ahead . i got you .
danny .
getting them out of china &apos;s easy .
paying for it-- that &apos;s the hard part .
laser audio surveillance .
you don &apos;t need a wire
to get a confession out of your hupo ass .
i &apos;m going to sue you for entrapment .
and when i &apos;m done collecting ,
i &apos;m going to find that little hottie you sent in here ,
and this time , i &apos;m going to be less of a gentleman .
sorry , boss .
i didn &apos;t see anything .
you didn &apos;t see anything ? !
son of a bitch hit me !
you want to file a report , you &apos;re going to need a witness .
do you want to file a report ?
i want to go to jail now .
where is he ?
where &apos;s hesse ?
what about your wife and kid ?
you know where they are ?
i do .
she &apos;s getting her nails done on kalakaua avenue .
and your boy is at his private school
in diamond head .
you know , i wonder what he &apos;s gonna think
when he finds out that daddy takes kids just like him
and puts them on the street
