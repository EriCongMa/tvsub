the only way i &apos;ll consider this is ... if they offer more than just season seats .
it &apos;s the knicks !
screw the knicks !
i didn &apos;t mean that . i just meant that .. the apartment is worth so much more ..
and the knicks rule.yeah , the knicks rule !
so ? are you going to do it ?
no , we &apos;re not going to because it &apos;s not an even trade .
all right , look .
what if you could keep the apartment and the tickets ?
done !
let me finish . i &apos;m talking about a bet . winner takes all .
we could get nothing.or everything .
i like that .
what do you say ?
just do it !
oh ! i &apos;m convinced !
come on , man ! you know i &apos;d do it for you .
because you &apos;re my best friend .
all right . but you can &apos;t use that again for a whole year .
i &apos;m in .
this is so exciting ! what are you going to bet ?
we should let phoebe decide ...
... because she &apos;s the only one who &apos;s impartial , and she &apos;s so pretty .

i would . i really would .
but my son is here.i can &apos;t leave him . you don &apos;t think there &apos;s any way ?
i don &apos;t think so .
it would be different if it was way into the future ...

it &apos;s us together forever , and that &apos;s what i want .
we &apos;ve known each other six weeks !
i know .
so what ? who &apos;s to say ? does that mean we can &apos;t do it ?
