silas .
hello , my shadow self .
every time i close my eyes ,
i can feel myself drowning in that safe ,
and i need to make it stop .
my body is breaking down .
and there &apos;s still one enemy that i can never escape , time .
good @-@ bye .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m dying of old age , stefan .
you &apos;re katherine pierce .
suck it up .
good news about having vampire blood in your system is ,
is that &apos;s step one to creating a new vampire .
this is step two .
he &apos;s gonna tear my head off .
elena , please .
no !
jesse !
just stay with me .
caroline , i &apos;m so sorry . i--
why does this say 12144 ?
what do you care ?
because i was 21051 .
you were an augustine vampire ?
i &apos;m sure augustine will be thrilled to have you back .
and that &apos;s the state of the world from your hometown tv news station
on june 11 , 1953 .
good night , mystic falls .
i &apos;m looking for joseph salvatore .
you found him .
love what you &apos;ve done with the place .
you know , if this whole boarding house thing doesn &apos;t pane out ,
you can always turn it into a high @-@ class brothel .
i &apos;m glad you got my telegram .
i haven &apos;t heard from stefan yet ,
but i &apos;m hoping he &apos;ll be here soon .
when &apos;s the last time you two spoke ?
well , he doesn &apos;t call , he doesn &apos;t write .
of course , neither do i.
in all fairness , i am the one that abandoned him on a train platform
in the middle of world war ii .
well , there &apos;s always time to be a better man .
eh , not sure i got one of those in me .
sorry about the vervain , damon .
the money was too good to pass up .
now i won &apos;t have to pay him .
who the hell are you ?
i &apos;ll be your doctor from now on .
what are you doing to me ?
just a little vervain .
what the hell are you doing to me ?
vervain to keep you calm .
wes ? why am i here ?
i lost a test subject last night ,
and you &apos;re gonna replace him .
dear diary ,
so here i am alive .
stefan saved me from killing myself .
now he &apos;s got me on suicide watch .
he says it will be therapeutic for me
to write down my feelings about the fact
that i &apos;m dying and there &apos;s nothing i can do about it .
deep thoughts , mortal coil , blah , blah , blah .
ugh . my hand &apos;s tired .
what kind of sentimental idiot writes down everything they feel ?
is what the prophecy meant when it said
that all the doppelgangers were drawn together like magnets ?
because if it is , i want my money back .
i &apos;m just trying to make sure you don &apos;t slit your wrists .
well , this whole neurotic granny vibe
doesn &apos;t exactly make me want to live .
do you really have nothing better to do
than stand there all day
and watch me write in cursive ?
i &apos;m trying to make sure you don &apos;t kill yourself .
and how are you going to do that ,
you know , since you &apos;re still having your little panic attacks ?
i &apos;m fine .
yeah . of course .
you are the picture of mental health , stefan ,
after being locked for 3 months in a safe
at the bottom of a quarry .
i am dealing with it .
i know . i mean , i heard you
dealing with it earlier today in the library .
it sounded like you freaked out and broke a chair ,
maybe even two .
how are you supposed to help me stay alive
if you can &apos;t even help yourself ?
so does this mean you want to live ?
no . it means that i can &apos;t work with people
who can &apos;t give me 100 % .
and so i may have called for backup .
what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m your sober sponsor ,
and i heard that you needed help .
really ?
and i got my mom to drop off something for us to use .
don &apos;t worry . i sanitized it .
aaron , hey .
hey . so you heard ?
heard what ?
that jesse &apos;s dead .
he killed himself last night .
campus security came by to tell me .
oh , my god .
i &apos;m so sorry .
what &apos;s up with this college ?
it &apos;s supposed to be different .
i came here to start fresh ,
get away from all the crap in my past ...
i get it .
after everything you &apos;ve been through ,
everything that you &apos;ve lost ,
i would want to start over , too .
how do you hit the reset button ?
me ? i haven &apos;t reset anything .
all my problems , they &apos;ve followed me here .
come to think of it , i &apos;m probably
not the right person to be getting advice from .
so if you &apos;re not here about jesse ,
uh , why are you here ?
i don &apos;t want to bother you ,
especially right now .
my day &apos;s not gonna get any worse ,
so , uh , go ahead .
ok . well , um , last night ,
you told me that wes was your legal guardian .
yeah . since this past summer
after my aunt sara died .
you see what i &apos;m talking about ?
everyone around me ends up dead ,
and my sunny disposition makes me so many friends .
i &apos;m sorry .
go ahead .
um , the thing is my boyfriend damon
went to talk to west last night ,
and no one &apos;s really seen or heard from either of them since ,
and that kind of worries me , you know ?
so i know how bad the timing is ,
but i just-- i was hoping
that maybe you could help me find wes .
yeah . yeah . i think i know a place that we can look .
just so you know ,
didn &apos;t end well for the last augustines .
you &apos;re inviting bad karma in by holding me here .
is that what you told dr. whitmore ?
dr. whitmore wasn &apos;t much for conversation .
as much as i would like a free checkup ,
you &apos;re gonna let me go .
that &apos;s a good try .
i &apos;m wearing vervain .
you know , most people would buy me dinner first .
this isn &apos;t a personal matter .
it &apos;s for the advancement of science .
what the hell are you talking about ?
you &apos;re a vampire .
your blood heals others , your body heals itself .
you &apos;ll regenerate parts of internal organs after i remove them .
listen . how i got this amazing body has nothing to do with science ,
so why don &apos;t you ...
you talk too much .
so you augustine freaks are still at it ,
eye exams and that sort of thing ?
jesse was proof that my research goes far beyond that .
i trained him to crave vampire blood instead of human blood .
now i &apos;m ready to take my research to the next level .
just doesn &apos;t make sense why jesse would kill himself .
so you believe what campus security told you ?
why , do you know something else ?
don &apos;t you think it &apos;s weird
that both of your friends committed suicide
before the first semester was even over ?
yeah , of course i think it &apos;s weird .
jesse loved it here , he had a huge crush on your friend .
megan had all these plans for her life .
which is why none of this makes sense .
aaron , look . i found megan &apos;s body the night that she died .
she was murdered ,
and wes forged her death certificate .
you saw her death certificate ?
i did some digging .
wes is part of something much bigger than anyone even realizes .
let &apos;s find him first .
i want to hear his side of the story .
you know , when you said that wes was probably doing research ,
i didn &apos;t realize it would be here at whitmore house .
oh , yeah . this place is like a second home .
what are you waiting for ? come in .
so who owns this place ?
not to sound like a douche ,
but technically , i do .
yeah . it &apos;s part of the whitmore trust
that i inherited when my parents died .
yeah . don &apos;t hold that against me .
usually when people find out that my name &apos;s aaron whitmore--
hold on . your last name &apos;s whitmore ?
so you , like , own this school ?
that &apos;s what they think .
that &apos;s my dad .
grayson gilbert was one of the best doctors the augustines ever had .
what the hell ?
i &apos;m glad he didn &apos;t live to see this .
i spent 3 months drowning in this thing .
what the hell were you thinking ?
i was thinking it &apos;s time for you to deal with the source of your ptsd .
and you &apos;re sure you &apos;re not just sublimating
your feelings about what happened to jesse last night ?
feelings ? what feelings would i have
about my best friend killing the guy i was crushing on ?
he was out of control ,
and elena did what she had to do .
no . elena did what she thought she had to do
just like she also thought that damon was good boyfriend material .
now you see where i &apos;m going with this ?
anyway , aren &apos;t you a drama major ?
what do you know about ptsd ?
well , i know that you tried to deal with it
your own way and you failed ,
so now ...
we &apos;re gonna try it my way .
you know that this is kidnapping , right ?
that was more like a tranquilizer .
what ? ok .
uh , what is going on here , wes ?
i had to make sure megan &apos;s death didn &apos;t draw attention to my work .
oh , to your work , your work ?
you study infectious disease transmittal .
i study vampires .
what ?
they exist , aaron ,
and elena gilbert is one of them ?
the syringe i used on her had vervain in it .
think of it as an antivampire drug .
it &apos;s one of my safety measures .
where did all this stuff come from ?
this work has been going on for generations
in secret .
your family pioneered it .
your dad trained me in it ,
and after your father died ,
the whitmore trust continued to fund my research .
why didn &apos;t you ever tell me about this ?
you never needed to know before now .
i meant to tell you this on your birthday .
this is what your family fought for
and believed in , aaron .
consider it your legacy .
come on , elena . wake up .
damon ? are you--
i &apos;m fine .
wes injected you with vervain .
maybe when it wears off , we &apos;ll be able to--
unh--break through these .
what the hell is going on ?
why are you here ? why am i here ?
wes is carrying out the grand augustine tradition ,
getting his kicks off vampire torture .
did he tell you that ?
he didn &apos;t have to .
i &apos;ve been here before .
someone in my family sold me out to the augustines in 1953 .
every day , this nut job dr. whitmore tortured us ,
cut into us , took pieces of our eyes out ,
pushed us to every limit he could imagine ,
and he had quite the imagination .
kept me in this very cell ,
and don &apos;t think i haven &apos;t appreciated the irony .
how long were you here ?
5 years give or take .
damon , how did you not go crazy ?
believe it or not , i made a friend .
welcome .
dr. whitmore never gets tired of watching us vampires heal ,
but he gives us one glass of blood per day ,
just enough to keep us alive .
pick yourself up , soldier .
my name &apos;s enzo .
he was a soldier in europe during world war ii .
how did he end up here ?
dr. whitmore was working in a battlefield hospital
when he discovered enzo was a vampire ,
so he drugged him , locked him in a coffin
to ship him overseas .
he &apos;d been here for 10 years by the time i joined the party .
you &apos;re doing it wrong .
you &apos;re living for the moment .
you need to live for the future .
what future ?
the one where you get your revenge .
for instance , in my future ,
my revenge will start with killing whitmore &apos;s dog
and mailing it to his house postage due .
go on . picture your revenge .
use your imagination .
i can see it .
damon ...
wes knew my dad .
they worked together .
he said that my dad was an augustine , too .
i know that my dad was a vampire hunter ,
but he was also the town doctor .
he was kind and gentle and loving .
he wouldn &apos;t be part of a place that would cut your eyes out .
people are full of surprises .
i am so , so sorry i got you caught up in this .
look at me .
but i promise you
i will get you out of here ,
ok ?
i &apos;ll get you out of here .
caroline !
do you even know what you &apos;re doing ?
yes . well , it &apos;s in my textbook .
let me find it .
have you two ever , um--ahem--you know ?
no , i don &apos;t know .
oh , come on . you know .
have you ?
oh , my god ! katherine , seriously ?
that wasn &apos;t exactly a yes or a no .
we are friends .
your loss . he &apos;s great in bed .
oh , god . i &apos;m so not listening to this .
here . ok , stefan . prolonged exposure therapy .
&quot; in vivo exposure gradually introduces elements of prior trauma ,
&quot; e.g. physical objects comma
circumstances of duress comma &quot; --
ok . yeah , yeah , yeah . got it , got it , got it .
stop talking .
the words that are coming out of your mouth are giving me a headache .
caroline ! caroline !
i &apos;m just help stefan understand what i &apos;m doing .
acting like a schoolteacher
isn &apos;t going to make him feel any better .
i can &apos;t breathe .
well , you are right about one thing .
he needs to get over the root of his problem
because right now the score is safe one ,
stefan zero .
so how do you help the guy who always comes to the rescue ?
stefan &apos;s the hero .
that &apos;s who he is at his core .
he can &apos;t always come through for himself ,
but he can always come through for everyone else .
i &apos;ve got an idea .
damon , how did you survive all those years ?
enzo &apos;s friendship kept me alive .
he gave me a reason to hang on to my humanity ...
you much of sports fan , damon ?
even when i thought i &apos;d be a prisoner forever .
no . neither am i.
any other interests-- fine wines , travel , cars ?
i &apos;m partial to jaguars myself ,
convertibles ,
the kind you take on a sunday drive to impress a pretty girl .
ever done that ?
once or twice .
oh , come now . got to be more than that .
the girl i was trying to impress
was more of a horse and carriage type girl .
what , just one girl ?
never met another one like her .
well , fair enough .
what about you ?
any pretty girls ?
eh , too many to count .
actually , there was one .
her name was maggie .
where &apos;d you meet her ?
here of all places .
she was working for dr. whitmore .
charming ?
oh , she was very .
she was kind to me .
she used to sit here in the hallway
taking notes while she observed me .
that &apos;s how you fell for her ?
oh , she was also stunningly beautiful .
you have to understand she--she wasn &apos;t part of the
torture and the experiments .
for the longest while , she didn &apos;t realize
that dr. whitmore was doing more than just observing my behavior .
i didn &apos;t have the heart to tell her .
i was just so glad of her company , you know ?
when she finally realized what was going on here ,
she couldn &apos;t bear it .
so she said she was sorry , and she left .
well ... you know ,
never really would have worked anyway .
you &apos;re a vampire , she &apos;s a human .
the relationship would have been doomed from the beginning .
you need a more positive outlook , mate .
who &apos;s next ?
21051 , you seem to have more energy .
i take that as an insult .
i &apos;m far more energetic than my neighbor here .
i can &apos;t believe you didn &apos;t notice .
your turn then .
why are you doing this to us ?
because , 21051,
i &apos;m seeking at the smallest indivisible unit
of your biological makeup ,
and once i can understand you from a cellular level ,
i can put you to use .
oh , my god , damon .
ok . stefan is gonna figure this out .
when you don &apos;t come home and no one hears from me ,
he will--he will find us .
points for optimism ,
but unfortunately stefan doesn &apos;t even know this place exists .
but you were here for 5 years .
yeah , and the first year , i thought he &apos;d rescue me .
he didn &apos;t . once i escaped ,
there was no point in giving him more to feel guilty about ,
so i never told him what happened here .
i never told any one .
yeah , but you did escape .
how did you do it ?
they let us out of the basement once a year .
every new year &apos;s eve , the augustine people
had a little cocktail party
with a vampire buffet on the side .
we were weak from vervain injections ,
half starved from living on a glass of blood a day ,
chained up like animals .
this little annual shindig is where dr. whitmore
got to show all of his augustine friends
what he &apos;d found in his research .
mrs. fell has generously offered her hand
for the purpose of this demonstration .
please observe .
he let his guests drink from us
to demonstrate the healing power of vampire blood .
the dermal layer is completely healed ,
no nerve damage , no muscular damage .
see for yourselves .
but on the plus side ,
that &apos;s how enzo came up with his plan .
well , the thing about our daily ration of blood
is that it &apos;s barely enough for one vampire to survive on ,
but if one vampire were to drink two rations
every day for the next year ,
he &apos;d be able to build up his strength
so that by the time new year &apos;s eve comes round again
that one vampire will be ready to fight .
are you sure that will work ?
i &apos;m sure i can only try with your help .
we &apos;ve just got to choose between us .
all right , damon .
we &apos;re gonna play scissor , paper , stone to decide .
paper covers rock .
all right then . a win &apos;s a win .
you &apos;ll lead the way .
here &apos;s my ration .
now we &apos;ve got 364 days to get you ready for the party . cheers .
cheers .
so did it work ?
more or less .
how did you get out ?
it doesn &apos;t matter , elena .
i got strong , i got out .
it wasn &apos;t pretty .
all you need to know .
here . another birthday present .
this belonged to your great grandfather .
it &apos;s a safety precaution for use in vampire research .
it &apos;s anna ruby campground .
that &apos;s where my parents died .
i know .
it wasn &apos;t an animal attack , was it ?
i found them , aaron .
i found you next to their bodies .
as soon as i saw them , i knew that vampires had attacked them .
that &apos;s why i continued your father &apos;s work ,
so this could never happen again .
i hope you &apos;ll join me .
so try not to be mad at me .
i got in here while you were unconscious .
then caroline locked us inside .
it was the only way .
let me out of here !
caroline !
i know it &apos;s a little extreme ,
but the baby steps approach wasn &apos;t working .
see ? that &apos;s why i need you not to get mad at me ,
because when you mad ,
you get anxious and violent
and you rip people &apos;s heads off ,
but i &apos;m gonna help you fix that .
caroline , get me out of here before i hurt her !
that &apos;s the whole point , stefan .
you need to get over your ptsd triggers .
ok ? or else you will kill me .
you &apos;re risking your life .
i &apos;m already dying , you idiot .
you &apos;re the one who wants to keep me alive .
it &apos;s my turn to help you now .
i can &apos;t be in here . please .
you &apos;re stefan salvatore .
suck it up .
no , no , no .
wes is gonna come back down here ,
and we &apos;ll both be the newest augustine experiment .
you have to tell me how you got out of here , damon .
you don &apos;t want to know , elena .
why ? you think that i &apos;m gonna judge you ?
damon , i love you .
i love you ,
and these people tortured you for 5 years .
whatever you had to do , i don &apos;t care .
all right .
all right .
the augustines &apos; next party was in 1958 .
i &apos;d been drinking enzo &apos;s ration for an entire year .
i mean , he kept a few drops here and there so he wouldn &apos;t desiccate ,
and as he starved himself ,
i got stronger from all the extra blood
just like he said i would .
ladies and gentlemen , as it is almost midnight ,
i think it fitting
that we toast the new year with a glass of vampire blood ,
wouldn &apos;t you agree ?
now you see it ...
damon , we got to get out of here .
damon , now ! let &apos;s go !
vervain !
come on , come on . you can do it .
enzo trusted me with his life .
the fire was getting out of control .
i would have burned up ,
or they would have captured me again .
there &apos;s no way i would have ever gotten another chance of escaping .
so i chose to save myself .
damon .
i &apos;m sorry , enzo .
damon , please .
and i knew if i was gonna save myself
that i had to stop caring about enzo .
so i turned off my emotions .
don &apos;t--don &apos;t leave me here .
don &apos;t go ! please !
damon !
i let my friend die .
please don &apos;t leave me ! damon !
come on ! damon !
damon !
after that , everything was fine .
everything was fine .
how &apos;s it going in there ?
i--i can &apos;t breathe .
i feel--i feel-- i feel like i &apos;m dying .
so i &apos;ve been using this time to think .
i think there is actually a little bit
of truth to this doppelganger prophecy .
i think you &apos;re still in love with elena .
i think you &apos;re miserable about the fact
that she chose damon over you
and that you want to get out of this one @-@ horse town
and as far away from their happiness as possible ,
and yet somehow ,
you keep finding excuses to stay in mystic falls .
i think i &apos;m just that latest excuse .
i &apos;m gonna kill you .
good . yeah . get it all out , stefan .
i think this is healthy ,
although don &apos;t forget you loved me before you hated me .
any reason you chose to have this conversation
with me locked in a safe ?
yes ! so that i can show you
that the safe isn &apos;t the problem .
how could you say that to me ?
the problem is you &apos;re not facing your real issues .
the death that you felt in the safe ,
the pain of dying over and over again ,
it &apos;s easier for you to focus on the physical pain
than the emotional heartbreak of elena leaving you .
your problem is you &apos;re not in touch with the reality of the moment ,
so let &apos;s bring you back to the present , shall we ?
in this moment ,
are you going to feed on me ,
or are you gonna save my life ?
fight it , stefan , fight it !
i &apos;m here .
i &apos;m here .
i &apos;m with you .
we &apos;re together .
it was so quiet , i got worried .
see ?
you made it out alive .
what the hell is this place ?
aaron ?
great . mini @-@ wes .
i had no idea what wes was doing .
i didn &apos;t even know there was a basement down here .
aaron , you have to help us .
i want to know the truth .
when you met me at megan &apos;s memorial ,
you asked me a bunch of questions .
slick hands , cowboy .
yeah ? well , i &apos;ve never used a gun before ,
and i &apos;ve never killed anyone either unlike you .
what are you talking about ?
wes said a vampire killed megan .
and you thought it was elena ?
no . megan was inside this house .
i hadn &apos;t even been invited yet . you ju--
wes also said that a vampire killed my parents .
maybe that was you , too .
no . aaron , that &apos;s impossible .
why else would you be so interested in me ?
calm down .
why else would you pretend to be my friend ?
she &apos;s a vampire !
not the one that killed your parents .
it was all me .
what did you just say ?
start talking .
damon , what are you doing ?
in 1958 , after the fire , enzo was dead ,
so i had to take on my revenge plan solo .
yes .
i can see it .
after i &apos;ve taken out the entire augustine society ,
i &apos;ll kill every member of the whitmore family .
boo ! i said use your imagination .
except one person .
i &apos;ll let that person grow up
and start a family ,
and then i &apos;ll start killing whitmores again .
then i &apos;ll take out the generation after that ,
leaving only one person to carry on the name ,
and then i &apos;ll take out the generation after that
and so on and so on and so on .
and that &apos;s exactly what i did .
how many whitmores have you killed ?
since 1958 ?
i lost count .
when was the last one ?
damon , when was the last one ?
a few months ago .
her name was sara .
i had to go all the way to charleston to find her .
it was a weekend trip .
you didn &apos;t know .
but we were together a few months ago .
starting the summer of our lives .
i had no idea .
told you it wasn &apos;t pretty .
no !
a little help here !
i mean , i know i &apos;m a vampire ,
but this thing is really heavy .
stefan ?
hello !
you know , for the record ,
i , uh , i only broke one of these .
it was an ugly chair .
you &apos;re better off without it .
so i guess you were right all along .
it was easier for me to focus on my physical pain than the breakup .
i need to move on .
so you admit it .
i do know what i &apos;m doing .
to be honest with you , i never know
exactly what you &apos;re doing , katherine .
well , stefan , sometimes ...
i don &apos;t either .
like right now ...
for example .
hey , elena . i &apos;m probably gonna stay at my mom &apos;s tonight .
i think i am officially homesick ,
so i &apos;ll let you know when i &apos;m ...
stefan .
oh , my god .
call me as soon as you get this !
look . i &apos;m sorry you had to find out about your parents like this .
what i found out is that i &apos;ve been lied to my entire life .
what the hell is going on , wes ?
their other friends gonna come after me ?
i mean , do i need to drop out ?
you &apos;ll be fine .
just go to school ,
live your life .
talk to you soon .
ohh . guess i had that coming .
elena ?
elena ?
elena ?
elena ! elena !
what &apos;s happening ?
welcome .
i &apos;m 12144 .
