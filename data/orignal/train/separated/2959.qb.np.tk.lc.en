okay , ross .
i realize that you didn &apos;t expect to walk in and see that , but ..
let me explain , okay ?
we weren &apos;t doing anything !
rach , he just saw us .
but what you saw , that is the extent of it , okay ? one kiss .
that &apos;s a lie ! we also kissed in barbados .
dude , chill !
okay , we also kissed in barbados ..
but we didn &apos;t plan it . the only reason that that happened ..
was because i saw you kiss charlie .
yeah , you started it ! i have got to chill .
look , we probably should have talked to you about this before it ever happened .
but ..
oh , we feel so terrible about this , ross .
yeah . but it did happen .
so ..
ross ?
ross ?
can we just close the door ?
the.one.where.ross.is.fine
ross , say something .
anything .
so you two are .. ?
yeah .
yeah .
and have you had .. ?
no . no , no , no .
no . no .
but if i hadn &apos;t walked in here , would you .. ?
probably .. no . no .
ross , this is not how we wanted you to find out about this .
you have every right to go nuts .
i &apos;m not going nuts . do you see me going nuts ?
no , but you know what i mean .
if you two are happy ..
then i &apos;m happy for you .
i &apos;m fine .
really ?
absolutely .
i &apos;m fine .
totally fine .
i don &apos;t know why it &apos;s coming out all loud and squeaky ..
because , really , i &apos;m fine .
i &apos;m not saying i wasn &apos;t a little surprised to see you guys kissing .
i mean , at first i was like :
but now that i &apos;ve had time to absorb it ..
loving this .
ross ..
it &apos;s all working out .
me and charlie . and you two .
you know what we should do ?
calm ourselves ?
no .
we should all have dinner .
yes , we &apos;ll do it tomorrow night . i &apos;ll cook !
look , don &apos;t you think that would be a little weird ?
weird ? what ? what &apos;s weird ?
the only thing weird would be if someone didn &apos;t like mexican food ..
because i &apos;m making fajitas !
i do like fajitas .
god , this adoption stuff is so overwhelming .
there &apos;s inter @-@ country adoption , dependency adoption .
there &apos;s so many ways to go , and this is , like , the biggest decision of our lives .
there &apos;s a hair in my coffee .
hey , guys .
have you seen frank jr . ? he &apos;s meeting me here with the triplets .
it &apos;s funny , every time you say &quot; triplets .. &quot;
i think of three hot , blond 19 @-@ year @-@ olds .
that &apos;s sweet .
drink your hair .
hey , what &apos;s all this stuff ?
they &apos;re brochures from different adoption agencies .
babies ! oh , this one is so cute .
get this one .
that &apos;s not really how it works .
oh , how does it work ?
i don &apos;t know !
if you &apos;re having a hard time , you should talk to my friends ..
bill and colleen . they adopted a kid . i &apos;m sure they &apos;d help you .
thanks , that would be great .
hey , honey , wouldn &apos;t that be great ?
all right , all right . remember what we talked about .
when we &apos;re in a public place , there are certain rules .
that &apos;s not what we talked about !
hi , frank .
hi .
good to see you .
good to see you too .
hi , frank .
hi . hey , how you doing ?
oh , my goodness , they &apos;ve all gotten so big . which one is which again ?
well , that &apos;s frank jr . jr ..
pulling the tampons out of the lady &apos;s purse .
and that &apos;s chandler climbing on chandler .
that &apos;s leslie throwing bagels at him .
she &apos;s got quite an arm there , doesn &apos;t she ? yeah .
hey , guys , come give me a hug .
triplets , hug your aunt !
it &apos;s like hugging fresh cookies .
oh , okay .
i &apos;m gonna eat you !
so how you been , frank ?
oh , good , you know . life is all right . just taking it day by day .
seems like somebody needs something .
oh , no . he &apos;s just trying to pull my shoulder out of it &apos;s socket .
oh , my god .
no , it &apos;s fine .
after i black out , he tries to put it back in , so ..
&quot; willing to adopt triplets ? &quot; no .
can i just say , i know we &apos;re doing this for ross and that &apos;s cool .
but if it was up to me , this is not what we &apos;d be doing on our first date .
well , what would we be doing ?
i &apos;d take you out for a romantic night .
some champagne , fancy dinner , feel you up on the carriage ride home .
feel me up ?
in a carriage .
well , maybe we can have our date later on tonight .
you know , after this , we &apos;ll go back to our apartment ..
right , right . yeah .
we could put on some music , light some candles , and then ..
you want to say feel me up , don &apos;t you ?
i just think it &apos;s something we should do .
hey , charlie !
hi .
hi .
hey .
so ..
dreading this ?
oh , you bet .
so did you bring a little something for ross ?
actually , it &apos;s some stuff you left at my apartment .
well , thanks .
and you can just give me my stuff whenever you want .
yeah , i didn &apos;t throw any of that out .
i thought i heard voices .
hi , charlie .
hey , joey .
and , oh , you &apos;re gonna have to introduce me to your new girlfriend .
i &apos;m just kidding . i know rachel . i know ..
come . please come in . come in .
okay . well , we brought you some wine .
that is so thoughtful .
she &apos;s a keeper .
and what did you bring me , huh ?
actually , that &apos;s ..
underwear , a toothbrush ..
and a van halen cd .
i can use all these things !
gosh , ross , you know , you seem a little ..
what ? fine ? because i am .
aren &apos;t you ? aren &apos;t you ? aren &apos;t .. ? you see ?
who else is fine ?
come on .
listen . why don &apos;t you try to relax . maybe have a drink .
you know what , that is a very good idea .
i &apos;m gonna go make a pitcher of margaritas .
oh , god .
so adorable .
look at them , sleeping there like angels .
yeah , i really cherish these moments ..
because before you know it , they &apos;re gonna be awake again .
well , they may be a handful ..
but they &apos;re so cute .
yeah .
oh , god , last time i babysat them , they did the funniest thing .
i haven &apos;t slept in four years .
that &apos;s a long time .
you just don &apos;t know how hard it is , phoebe .
there &apos;s just so many of them .
you know , two i could handle .
two &apos;s great . you just hold one in each hand .
what do i do when the third one runs at me with his bike helmet on ?
i got no more hands to protect my area .
there &apos;s three of them , phoebe . three .
yeah , i know , frank .
i counted them when they were coming out of my area .
sometimes , i think that ..
oh , no , no , no , i can &apos;t say it . it &apos;s too horrible . no .
what ?
no , no , i can &apos;t .
oh , my god , frank . are you thinking of leaving ?
because i didn &apos;t have those triplets so you could run out on them .
oh , no , i would never do that . no . i just ..
was thinking that , you know , maybe you could take one .
what ?
you can &apos;t separate them , that &apos;s terrible ! which one ?
thank you so much for seeing us .
phoebe has told us great things about you guys .
please , we &apos;re happy to help .
we went through the same thing when we were adopting .
so a lot of malfunctioning wee @-@ wees and hoo @-@ hoos in this room , huh ?
i mean , you have a lovely home .
we appreciate anything you can tell us .
well , actually , i think this might help .
it &apos;s pretty much ..
all the information you need .
oh , my god .
everything is broken into categories , then cross @-@ referenced .
then color @-@ coded to correspond with the forms in the back .
thank you .
i think i just had a tiny orgasm .
i know the process is frustrating , but it &apos;s so worth it .
adopting owen was the best thing that ever happened to us .
that &apos;s great . can i see the book ?
you want me to wash my hands first , don &apos;t you ?
please . it &apos;s just so pretty and white .
bathroom is down the hall to your left .
i would have told him to do it too .
can i adopt you ?
hey , you must be owen .
yeah .
i &apos;m chandler . hey , i was in the scouts too .
you were ?
in fact , my father was a den mother .
you know how to use a compass ?
i have a badge in it .
you do ? that &apos;s fantastic .
you want to see it ?
i &apos;d love to , but i gotta get back to your parents .
they &apos;re telling us about how they adopted you .
what ?
what ?
i &apos;m adopted ?
i got nothing .
i &apos;m adopted ?
no .
i didn &apos;t say that . i said ..
you &apos;re a doctor .
a doctor .
hey , doctor , my arm hurts . can you fix it for me ?
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m adopted .
so you &apos;re not gonna fix my arm ?
well , that first batch of margaritas was not so great ..
but this second batch is good .
well , maybe the next batch , we could all get some .
oh , god , this is fun , isn &apos;t it ?
you know , just the four of us .
just hanging .
dude , are you okay ?
and when are the fajitas gonna be ready ?
i &apos;m fine , okay ? i &apos;m great.i &apos;m just .. i &apos;m just proud of us .
you know ? there &apos;s no weirdness , no tension .
no awareness .
we make a great foursome . we should do more stuff together .
let &apos;s take a trip !
we could all go on your boat .
joey has this amazing sailboat .
actually , ross , i sold the boat two years ago .
oh , no . idiot !
well , yeah , but i could get another one .
this trip sounds great .
yeah ?
okay , where do you think we can go ?
my fajitas !
look , charlie , i just want you to know ..
ross is just having a little trouble adjusting to the thought of joey and me .
you know , he normally doesn &apos;t drink like this .
you know what , this is nothing . my father is a raging alcoholic .
i &apos;m sorry , have i made this evening uncomfortable ?
fajitas ! be careful ! very hot plate ! very hot !
ross , you don &apos;t even have oven mitts on .
that is gonna hurt tomorrow .
okay , well , this is crazy .
we can &apos;t seriously be talking about me taking one of your kids , can we ?
oh , no , of course we &apos;re not .
that &apos;s insane .
i know .
alice would never go for it .
she &apos;s pretty tired too . i think we could get her on board .
well , just for argument &apos;s sake , you know , hypothetically ..
which one would you be willing to give up ?
frank jr . jr . ?
well , it &apos;d be great for my shoulder .
you &apos;d be getting a really good one .
he &apos;s really funny .
like , the other day , he made up this joke :
what &apos;s green and says , &quot; hey , i &apos;m a frog &quot; ?
a talking frog .
oh , no , you can &apos;t have him , he &apos;s too funny .
well , all right , that &apos;s fine . what about leslie ?
oh , no , no , not leslie . no .
she &apos;s the only one that knows how to burp the alphabet .
all right , so that leaves chandler .
no , no , you can &apos;t have chandler . no , no . she &apos;s my little genius .
i got big hopes for her .
she &apos;s gonna be a doctor or a realtor .
wow , frank , i think we just ran out of kids .
oh , i think you &apos;re right .
oh , wow . phoebe , i don &apos;t think i can give one of them up .
i mean , you know , they drive me crazy , but they &apos;re my babies .
i &apos;m sorry , frank , i didn &apos;t realize things were so bad .
you know , i &apos;ll help out more . i can baby @-@ sit anytime you want .
you name the day and i &apos;ll be there .
how about tomorrow ?
well , that &apos;s not good .
but i can move some stuff around and i &apos;ll be there .
you and alice just take the whole day together .
you &apos;d do that for us ?
are you kidding ? that &apos;s what sisters are for .
oh , look at them .
i love you so much .
oh , crap , don &apos;t wake up ! don &apos;t wake up !
where are bill and colleen ?
kitchen , getting something to eat .
can you believe how nice they are ?
we have to leave .
why ? what did you do in the bathroom ?
i didn &apos;t get to the bathroom . i bumped into owen on the way .
he didn &apos;t know he was adopted . there &apos;s a slight chance ..
i may have told him .
oh , my god , where &apos;s my purse ? no , i can replace everything in there .
get that binder and let &apos;s go !
hi .
some little snacks for everybody .
you don &apos;t have to eat the sour worms . those are for owen .
i &apos;ll go get him in a second .
by the way , you should know , we haven &apos;t told him he &apos;s adopted yet .
but kids are so intuitive .
don &apos;t you think , on some level , he already knows ?
i &apos;m adopted ?
see ? intuitive .
what ? where did you hear that ?
he told me .
and he paid me 50 dollars not to tell .
which , technically , now you should give back .
you told him he &apos;s adopted ?
i &apos;m sorry . you should have a sign out there or something .
or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door .
&quot; owen doesn &apos;t know he &apos;s adopted , and he also thinks santa is real . &quot;
he isn &apos;t ?
we have to get out of here , baby .
what is the matter with you ?
all right , look , i know what chandler did was not the best ..
but anyone would assume that a 12 @-@ year @-@ old has been told he &apos;s adopted .
yeah , he &apos;s 8 .
wow , he &apos;s tall .
what country did you get him from ?
everyone , i would like to make a toast ..
to rachel and joey .
and to love .
ah , love !
l @-@ o @-@ v @-@ e. love .
l is for &quot; life . &quot;
and what is life without love ?
oh , my god , are we supposed to answer ?
o is for :
&quot; oh , wow ! &quot;
the v is for this ..
very surprising turn of events ..
which i am still fine with , by the way .
e ..
is for how ..
extremely normal i find it ..
that you two ..
are together .
and that one day you might get married ..
and have children of your own .
dude , are you okay ?
totally .
ross , you don &apos;t seem okay .
i &apos;m sorry , it must be the pressure of entertaining .
i think everyone would feel better if we had some flan .
wait , ross . ross , i .. i have to take off .
no !
i &apos;m sorry .
i have an early class in the morning .
but this has been lovely .
wasn &apos;t it ? and you thought it would be awkward with joey .
and that you never really liked rachel .
you are on fire ! i &apos;ll call you in the morning , okay ?
okay .
all right .
god , rachel , what ross just said , that &apos;s just ..
that &apos;s okay . girls tend not to like me .
fine .
okay . i guess it &apos;s just flan for three .
hey , that rhymes .
you know what , ross , i think we &apos;re gonna take off too .
of course . god , i &apos;m so stupid .
you guys are a couple now .
i mean , you probably just want to be alone .
no , it &apos;s just getting late ..
it &apos;s fine . it &apos;s totally fine .
i &apos;ve got plenty of margaritas . it &apos;s all good .
i don &apos;t even know what that &apos;s for .
you know what ?
i think i &apos;m gonna stay here and make sure he &apos;s okay .
that &apos;s probably a good idea .
i &apos;ll see you in the morning .
okay .
yeah , you know , joey , i ..
i don &apos;t think he &apos;s ever gonna be okay with this .
it doesn &apos;t look good , does it ?
i guess i made tater tots .
ross , oven mitts !
morning .
here you go .
thanks .
did you stay here all night ?
yeah .
so you took off my pants and shoes ?
no . no , no .
you actually did that when you were dancing to the chicago soundtrack .
look , ross ..
about rachel and i. listen , you don &apos;t have to worry about that ..
because nothing &apos;s gonna happen .
what do you mean ?
she and i said from the beginning ..
we weren &apos;t gonna do anything unless you were okay with it .
and clearly ..
what are you talking about ? i &apos;m fine .
are we still doing this ?
no .
it &apos;s okay , ross . you know , i totally understand .
of course you &apos;re not fine . you &apos;re ..
you &apos;re ross and rachel .
yeah , except we &apos;re not .
i mean , we haven &apos;t been a couple in , like ..
six years .
my god , is that right ?
has it been that long ?
that &apos;s what i hear , yeah .
this is crazy . i mean , six years ..
and because of me , you guys aren &apos;t gonna be together ?
can i ask you something ?
really ..
what is this thing with you and rachel ?
come on , you know me . you know ..
joey .
i &apos;m crazy about her .
and she feels the same way ?
i think so .
well , then ..
maybe it &apos;s time we all moved on .
yeah , but , ross , i mean , you &apos;re not okay with it , so ..
no , but i want to be .
i will be .
besides , i &apos;m with charlie , right ?
oh , my god , i &apos;m still with charlie , aren &apos;t i ?
she didn &apos;t see the dance , did she ?
no , no , no .
no , that was .. that was just for me .
hey , you .. ?
you sure about this ?
yeah , i &apos;m sure .
and ..
we &apos;re okay ?
hey , phoebe .
hey .
we just want to give you a heads up .
bill and colleen hate us .
why ?
owen didn &apos;t know he &apos;s adopted and monica told him .
what ?
he didn &apos;t know ? he &apos;s 12 .
no , he &apos;s only 8 .
i &apos;ll bet he &apos;s russian .
still , he had to find out sometime .
how would you like it if someone told the triplets that you gave birth to them ?
