and now , the news .
you wanna take it for a test drive ?
last week we talked about you feeling like the sad clown .
what &apos;s going on now ?
well , i had a dream the other night ...
i was riding in a cadillac , like my father used to have .
carmela was driving ,
and i was in the back passenger seat .
sitting next to me was gloria .
in front of me , sitting next to carmela , was a business associate of mine .
he &apos;s the one whose son had the accident .
i don &apos;t know where we were going . no place .
&apos;cause we never seemed to get anywhere .
kinda like this therapy .
and it was hot in the car , it was stuffy .
there was no air @-@ conditioning .
that &apos;s all of it .
oh , and ...
my friend had a caterpillar on his head .
it turned into a butterfly .
has your friend recently changed ?
not a friend . associate .
and no .
what do you think the dream means ?
can &apos;t you tell me what the fucking thing means ? i mean , you obviously know .
why do we have to go through this exercise every time ?
i don &apos;t obviously know . i didn &apos;t have the dream .
the meaning is elicited through verbalization .
and the gehoxtahagen is framed up by the ramistan .
okay . your wife ...
your mistress , a business associate , you ...
all in the same car .
your father &apos;s car .
with my wife driving ...
which , if my father were alive ...
he wouldn &apos;t have stood for two fucking seconds .
i hear anger .
no , i &apos;m just saying ,
the old guys were different .
men in the front , wives in the back .
you like that arrangement ?
actually , i think the wife should ride in a little cart behind the car .
like in the cartoons .
like behind noah &apos;s ark , there &apos;s a little boat with the skunks .
so wives are skunks ?
oh , jesus fucking christ , it &apos;s a fucking joke .
does it have to be like a cancer hospital in here ?
but carmela is in control in the dream .
why ? &apos; cause she &apos;s driving ?
whatever &apos;s gone on with the other two ,
you want to square it with carmela .
why ?
that &apos;s what we need to find out .
freud says dreams are wishes .
dreams are wishes ?
i thought you said that dreams represent repressed urges and ...
it depends .
i oughta quit this fucking therapy .
&quot; maybe it &apos;s this , maybe it &apos;s that . &quot; maybe it &apos;s a fungule !
what about impulse control ? i been sitting in this chair for four years ...
and nothing &apos;s been done about that !
and it leads me to make mistakes at my work !
what good did you do me with that ?
let &apos;s get back to the dream .
oh , fuck the dream , it &apos;s just a dream .
jesus christ , the money i spend here , i could &apos;ve bought a ferrari .
at least i would &apos;ve got a blowjob out of that !
what do you mean ?
please . don &apos;t get me started .
i think you &apos;re glossing over the significant accomplishments we &apos;ve made in here .
&quot; my mother would come when she looked at a pot roast . &quot;
&quot; oh , you &apos;re second in the birthing order . &quot;
&quot; oh , carmela &apos;s driving the car , how fucking interesting . &quot;
when you first came here , you were clinically depressed .
you suffered from panic attacks that put your life in danger .
there &apos;s been significant relief in both those areas .
you &apos;re right , but ...
i mean , come on . i &apos;ve been coming here four years now .
i &apos;ve been a good sport .
sophia ! your jacket .
you &apos;re just getting over a cold , come on .
i miss you so much .
i &apos;d be with you right now if it wasn &apos;t for the kids .
we want a 40 @-@ percent position in your hud business .
&apos;cause i bent on the other thing ,
you &apos;re entitled to reach into my pocket on this ?
that was a gesture of goodwill .
we &apos;ve been down this road before .
we share zellman .
therefore , any of the fruits of zellman , we &apos;re entitled to .
we done here ?
fucking ralph .
where &apos;s your point man on this thing ?
he missed his drops this week .
i don &apos;t know .
maybe you can tell me .
about what we expected .
blooming onion . cool .
the steak with the toothpick is daddy &apos;s , he likes it still mooing .
i saw on cnbc that outback &apos;s profitability is ...
excuse me .
dad ?
sit and eat .
it &apos;s a sin to waste good food .
try the mushrooms . i don &apos;t know what they do to them , but they &apos;re delicious .
i &apos;m all right .
the kids are fed .
thank you .
what did you do with the cake today ?
cake ?
your daughter saw it in the back of your car .
she told me about it when i picked her up from practice .
i took it to karen &apos;s grave .
i buried it .
today was our anniversary .
fourteen years .
i wish you would &apos;ve told me about it before i picked up the steaks from outback .
the sides alone were over $ 30 .
how often do you go to the grave ?
every day .
that &apos;s what i miss the most , talking to her .
believe me , bobby , i know . i lost both my parents .
it &apos;s very easy for people to give facile advice :
&quot; suck it up , move on , &quot; etc .
i &apos;m not gonna tell you that . grieving is a process .
sometimes courage isn &apos;t a value .
tony .
hello ?
look ...
let &apos;s not let this get out of hand .
we &apos;ve been doing good business for a while now .
carmine agrees . i agree .
forty percent is not gonna happen . we all know it .
i &apos;m willing to go five and a half .
hello ?
not acceptable .
this guy who does the housing appraisals for tony ...
&quot; vic the appraiser , &quot; they call him .
i want you to pay a visit to this polack tony soprano &apos;s ...
got doing phony house appraisals .
vic the appraiser .
make this guy understand that he &apos;s gonna be working for us ...
on these shithole houses we bought in jersey .
you got it .
why did he get her a cake ? she died .
go back to bed .
nicky ghilardi said mommy &apos;s ghost is gonna come back and haunt us .
there &apos;s no such things as ghosts .
the cake ?
maybe it was for the nuns .
sometimes , when i &apos;m walking down the hallway , i can smell her hair .
well , maybe if we did something bad , she &apos;d haunt us for our own good .
there &apos;s nothing to be scared of . go back to bed .
tony &apos;s pretty hot ... that you didn &apos;t counteroffer .
god forbid , if this gets really bad ...
there could be a change .
tony ?
suffice to say , no matter what happens now , or in the future ...
carmine won &apos;t forget you .
and as far as us talking like this ...
it &apos;s just because we &apos;re old friends .
and i know i can blow off a little steam with you .
cheaper than a bartender .
i &apos;m only trying to bring good relations between the families ...
as i always do and always will .
no matter what happens or who &apos;s in charge .
if it &apos;s me , god forbid ...
or whoever .
hey , branca . how you doing ?
hello .
is he around ?
shaving .
how &apos;s your boss ?
shaving his face .
no , your employer there , miss kirilenko ?
fine .
reason i &apos;m asking is &apos; cause we didn &apos;t get the bill .
here he is .
i &apos;ve fucking had it .
with what ?
everything .
did you offer my nephew something ?
i &apos;m a registered nurse .
not maid .
did you offer him an aspirin ?
cunt .
what &apos;s with you ?
this fucking competency hearing .
delayed twice , and now it &apos;s coming up on friday .
i don &apos;t know whether to chill the champagne or shit in my pants .
it &apos;s gonna be ...
you got shaving cream all over you .
don &apos;t you wash yourself off ?
it &apos;s over here , too .
yeah , it &apos;s that fucking lighting upstairs .
if bobby put in the right wattage ...
all right , listen . we found out where the jurors meet every day
before they &apos;re bused to the courthouse .
now if this mental competency thing don &apos;t work ...
i don &apos;t wanna talk about it .
so , what is the story there with you two ?
he &apos;s a great guy . he &apos;s just still very much in mourning .
we &apos;re stuck at platonic .
well , karen was a wonderful person .
i &apos;m sure god must have his reasons ... but sometimes you have to wonder .
well , i &apos;m sure she was as good as gold , but he &apos;s developing a psychosis .
her clothes are still in the closet .
and yesterday he bought her a cake for their anniversary ...
and he buried it at her grave .
what ? at her grave ?
god forbid that i should say something ,
because i would be perceived as a harpy ...
coming between him and his dead , idealized wife .
listen , you , don &apos;t make any plans for sunday .
the baccilieris are coming over . make those kids feel welcome .
bobby junior ? the kid &apos;s like 11 .
i don &apos;t ask you to do chore one !
you can go without seeing devin and your friends for one night .
yeah , we were supposed to study . but i guess you don &apos;t care about that .
vic !
you don &apos;t return johnny &apos;s phone calls ?
what did you say ?
i &apos;m only the appraiser !
now , let me appraise you of this .
be at the red chimney on route 3 , 9 : 00 tomorrow morning ...
ready to go to work for johnny and carmine .
victor &apos;s scared now .
nobody knows where he is .
look , it &apos;s a bluff .
they don &apos;t wanna start a separate operation .
you know the costs that are involved in a hud scam ?
you got the appraiser , the poverty pimp .
they want in on a going thing .
you want me to pay a visit to johnny sack &apos;s guys ?
just say the word .
you know what ?
i &apos;m not gonna go fucking ballistic .
all due respect , t.
throwing your appraiser a beating was a provocation to you directly .
there he is .
you tell him to stop beeping that horn ,
or i &apos;m gonna shove it up his fucking ass !
all right , sil .
enjoy the game .
i &apos;ll see you , tony .
all right , vit &apos; .
you ever talk to beansie down there in florida ?
now and then .
does he ever run into carmine &apos;s son down in miami ?
i &apos;ll be on my cell if you need me .
beansie tells me ... he sees little carmine all the time .
well , maybe beansie can feel him out .
see if he &apos;s receptive to a meet with me .
maybe we can work this shit out , if he talks to his old man .
beansie &apos;s gotta happen to run into him .
not like we &apos;re asking .
yeah , it was pretty cool .
look at that .
just stuffed artichokes .
no cactus for me .
you &apos;re not italian if you don &apos;t like artichoke .
so what , mike piazza eats nothing but artichokes ?
i mean , that &apos;s dicked up .
all right .
i like rice . maybe i &apos;m chinese .
a.j.
you , too , bobby .
how &apos;d you like it if oriental kids were making fun of you ?
i &apos;ll get it .
you want an artichoke , bobby junior ?
no .
it &apos;s dinnertime .
you sure , b. j ? you &apos;re really missing out .
i said already .
hi , mrs. soprano .
everybody , this is devin .
would you like something to eat ?
no , thank you , i &apos;ll just wait inside .
she tell you who i saw at schantz &apos;s hardware last week ?
oh , god , do you have to tell every person you run into ?
i &apos;ll put an end to the mystery right now . connie francis .
excuse me .
she was looking at recessed lighting .
i put in recessed lighting . but i &apos;m sorry now .
hello ?
tony , it &apos;s me .
hey , how you doing ?
fine fettle .
listen , i spoke to our friend . the son . he seemed very receptive .
tuesday night .
we &apos;ll meet down here in florida .
we &apos;ll pick a place later .
i got my stepdaughter and her friends this weekend .
i &apos;m gonna have to bring them along .
okay , good .
thanks .
somebody will call you .
where is anthony ?
he went upstairs with that girl .
you two come with me .
that door is not supposed to be closed .
we were studying .
is this how you treat your guests ?
my guests ? you invited them .
these kids just lost their mom . could you give them a little time ?
you know how much little bobby likes you .
now what am i , daycare ?
you must have a million games in here . clue , monopoly .
help them pick something out .
come on in , kids . a.j. &apos; s gonna help you find a game .
spirit ...
speak to me .
is bobby junior gay ?
now , do it again for real , like last time with the dead little baby .
quit messing around .
okay , serious .
spirits , identify yourself .
you &apos;re forcing it again .
shut up !
do you think it &apos;s my mom ?
probably not . it &apos;s not people you know .
will you do it with me , devin ?
okay .
spirit .
do you know karen baccilieri ?
is she making new friends in heaven ?
maybe we should play something else .
this is stupid . let &apos;s play clue .
you &apos;re just a scared little baby .
i &apos;m not scared . i have this game at home .
i used to play it all the time ...
until it got boring .
how about we try and contact the dead for real ?
just heard from our friend . the other guy &apos;ll sit down . i &apos;m going on tuesday .
want me there ?
i was thinking of bringing paulie down .
face time with you could be what he needs .
he &apos;s on the rag lately .
then i decided against it .
the other day , we were talking about florida .
i noticed you clammed up around paulie .
you did , too .
it occurred to me that maybe paulie &apos;s the one ...
telling our friend in new york all our business .
somebody had to pass along that fat joke .
he was in youngstown at the time .
in the can . - what , people can &apos;t visit him ?
jesus , you believe this shit ?
we &apos;re talking about fucking paulie here .
for now , he &apos;s got no reason to know about the trip .
nobody &apos;s got a reason to know .
absolutely . it &apos;s on a need @-@ to @-@ know basis .
and get this fucking appraiser working again . i got houses just sitting there .
you got to hold hands .
and nobody let go .
the most important thing ...
is that you keep your eyes closed during the ceremony ...
because if you open them , whatever spirits we &apos;re speaking to ...
will permanently remain trapped between worlds forever .
everybody &apos;s eyes shut ?
oh , great spirit from beyond .
reveal yourself .
give us a sign of your presence .
keep laughing if you think it &apos;s funny .
it was you .
you hear that ?
what ?
i heard it .
me , too .
wait . i see a ...
gray mist ...
with little specks of light .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m seeing , too .
wait .
i see somebody . an old man .
spirit from another dimension , can you reveal yourself ?
what ?
what &apos;s that ?
how come he &apos;s only talking to you ?
because i &apos;m the oldest , and closest to the afterlife .
you &apos;re a sea captain ?
captain jacobus ?
what ?
he says it &apos;s a terrible storm .
it &apos;s raining where you are ?
waves are smashing against the boat ?
he &apos;s here !
oh , jesus christ , they &apos;ll kill me .
what &apos;s going on ?
oh , my god , what happened ?
nothing , we were just playing .
we were playing ouija board . and then a.j. did this seance .
dad , i want to go home .
soph &apos; , it &apos;s just a ouija board .
she &apos;s just scared .
it &apos;s okay , honey , daddy &apos;s here .
this is your idea of fun ? you scared these kids half to death !
i didn &apos;t do anything . he freaked out .
why &apos;s your shirt all wet ?
bobby , look , he had a sponge .
after what we just talked about , this is what you do ?
you asshole .
you , say good night .
you , get out of my sight .
i can &apos;t remember when i was more disappointed in you .
you know what ?
he locked me in the garage at the guy with the ponytail &apos;s house .
bobby , i don &apos;t even know what to say . i am so embarrassed .
part of growing up , don &apos;t worry about it .
i &apos;m only the appraiser !
what do you think ? you could hide from us ?
tony bought three more houses that need appraisals .
i can &apos;t . i told you , please .
johnny and carmine &apos;s guys , they hurt me .
that &apos;s nothing compared to what we &apos;re gonna do , victor .
so go back inside , get your appraising shit , and start appraising .
did you like the movie ?
what &apos;s the matter ?
you went to the cemetery today , didn &apos;t you ?
how do you know ?
&apos;cause you got cemetery mud on your shoes .
mud ? what are you , marge hingenbrender now ?
what do you know about the mud ? you been spying on me ?
what , i can &apos;t go to the cemetery ? i got to get permission from you ?
we &apos;re talking about you . not me .
you know , the grave and the funeral ...
it &apos;s never ending . you don &apos;t want to let it go .
did you even pay the funeral bill yet ?
i &apos;m never gonna pay him .
son of a bitch put an extra 15 pounds on karen when they did her up .
this dispute with the bill is morbid clinging .
this is exactly what i mean , we have a nice evening ...
and we end up talking about your dead wife .
you invited me .
the other night at tony &apos;s ...
your kids were trying to contact karen on a ouija board .
what do you expect ? you &apos;re talking to a headstone .
she &apos;s my wife .
she &apos;s dead , and i &apos;m here .
shut the fuck up .
you shut the fuck up .
tony , it &apos;s svetlana .
i &apos;ve just received the brooch .
i want to thank you .
i don &apos;t know why i deserve it , but ...
no , i don &apos;t want to hear that .
i want you to keep it .
i &apos;m gonna keep it , don &apos;t worry .
diamonds like this ...
it &apos;s a very nice gift . very sweet .
and what happened between us ...
it was nice , too .
okay , well ...
that &apos;s it , then ?
these things happen , and then life goes on .
are you sure ? because ...
if you ever want to talk , or you ever need anything ...
no , it &apos;s all right . thank you for the brooch .
broke a woman &apos;s heart . told her i couldn &apos;t see her no more .
sad , but there was no getting around it .
who is she ?
takes care of my uncle .
runs an elder care agency .
she took care of my mother , too .
your former girlfriend &apos;s cousin ?
that one , yeah .
is she your current cumare ?
no , some brief fling kind of thing .
you know , after a while , i felt like i had to cut off her leg .
not leg , affair . did i say leg ?
why did you cut it off ?
jesus , i am married .
what happened ?
i bought her the ...
it &apos;s this diamond pin that i send to every woman when i &apos;m ...
easing out the door , i &apos;m such a fucking prick .
you know what ?
this is all bullshit .
it was she who gave me my walking papers .
you believe that ?
what i meant was that ...
you know why she didn &apos;t want to see me anymore ?
she said that i was high maintenance .
and this is after all the time and all the money and all the fucking prozac ...
and all the fucking cocksucking , motherfucking dream interpretations .
and she says she didn &apos;t want to prop me up .
and this from a broad that walks around on crutches half the time .
nice ?
do you agree with her characterization of you ?
i &apos;m a miserable prick . i &apos;ve said this since day one .
and you &apos;re no longer interested in changing ?
in finding a way out ?
no , i guess not .
i said this last time . you just didn &apos;t want to hear it .
you &apos;re paying me for my honest opinion .
you should be in therapy .
all this fucking self @-@ knowledge , what the fuck has it gotten me ?
okay , maybe it got me some shit in the beginning . some leadership strategies .
all we do now is sit around half the time ...
shooting the breeze about philosophy , the italians , my uncle eckley .
i try to keep the focus on the work .
so when it goes off , it &apos;s my fault ? okay , fine , i accept that .
you know what she says ?
this broad ...
she &apos;s from russia , dirt poor .
she had some kind of osocarma disease in her leg when she was nine .
she says that nowhere else in the world do people expect to be happy ...
except for here in this country , and still we &apos;re not . and we got everything .
and when we &apos;re not , what do we do ? we go to shrinks .
for what , $ 6 or $ 7 a minute ?
there &apos;s some truth to what she says .
but should that be a source of shame ?
that when the desperate struggle for food and shelter is finally behind us ...
we can turn our attention ... to other sources of pain and truth ?
&quot; pain and truth . &quot; come on , i &apos;m a fat fucking crook from new jersey .
now that the panic attacks and the baseline depression ...
have been dealt with , the real work can begin .
i knew you &apos;d say something like that .
because it &apos;s true .
when we &apos;re not constantly having to put out fires ...
we can really delve into who you are ...
and what you &apos;re really after in your very brief time on this earth .
i &apos;m sorry .
i don &apos;t want to do this anymore .
and you can say that i &apos;m running away .
but i &apos;ve been here longer than i thought i &apos;d stay .
longer than anybody ever thought i &apos;d stay .
and you know what ? i get no appreciation for it .
you &apos;ve shown a lot of courage .
i commend you on that .
thank you for the commendation and adios .
look , no fault , no foul .
i appreciate everything you &apos;ve done for me .
come to your next appointment . one more time .
you &apos;ll cover my $ 300 @-@ a @-@ week in no time with some other mortadella .
all right , i shouldn &apos;t have said that .
look , you saved my life in the beginning ...
and for all the times i came on like an asshole , i &apos;m very sorry .
you &apos;ve got my number if you change your mind .
and if you begin to feel any of the old feelings , you need to call me .
so , what &apos;s customary ? i mean , do we shake hands ?
how about a diamond pin ?
okay , well ...
goodbye .
you &apos;ve reached doctor elliot kupferberg .
please leave a message at the sound of the beep .
if this is an emergency ...
you can reach me at 973 @-@ 555 @-@ 7089 .
guess who &apos;s no longer a patient of mine .
calling all cars .
his user name had 666 . that means satan .
i was gonna park in that spot .
ball breaker , welcome to miami .
mr. melvoin , i &apos;ve read your application for dismissal ...
on the grounds of mental incompetence .
and i &apos;ve reviewed the findings of the doctors in this matter .
frankly , they were unmoved by mr. soprano &apos;s performance .
your honor , to couch it as a performance ...
it &apos;s their opinion that he understands the charges ...
and that he &apos;s more than competent to participate in his own defense .
i &apos;d like another round of testing .
your honor ...
i didn &apos;t come all this way to stop this trial now .
court will convene on monday at 9 : 30 to continue proceedings .
your honor , please .
since his injury , i have not had a single conversation with mr. soprano ...
in which we &apos;ve related on any meaningful level .
feel free to take that up on appeal .
fuck !
we &apos;ll get to a juror . we &apos;re working very hard .
hello ?
bobby , hi . what &apos;s up ?
i was just doing housework . why ?
is everything all right ?
oh , my god .
tell me about it .
got home tonight .
kids were kind of quiet .
then bedtime , all hell broke loose .
crying , wouldn &apos;t be left alone .
sophia , especially .
they &apos;ve been playing with that goddamn ouija board again .
oh , no .
they were trying to contact karen .
what ?
i don &apos;t know what to say , bobby .
i came over this afternoon with some pound cake .
i saw it .
i heard them in his room with that ouija board .
i thought , &quot; this is not good . &quot;
but then after the other night , i didn &apos;t want to overstep my bounds .
it &apos;s my fault .
you &apos;re under a lot of stress . you &apos;re a single dad .
no , you were right . it &apos;s bad for them .
it &apos;s unwholesome .
you want me to go up ?
i think they &apos;re asleep . finally .
i had to read to sophia for like an hour .
she couldn &apos;t even handle a nancy drew , it was too mysterious .
go ahead .
it &apos;s just ...
the dead have nothing to say to us , bobby .
it &apos;s our own narcissism that makes us think they even care .
it does get better with time .
did you get anything to eat at least ? can i fix you something ?
no , it &apos;s too much trouble .
no , it &apos;s not .
i &apos;m starving , too .
there &apos;s probably something in here .
karen &apos;s ziti ?
it &apos;s the last one she made .
and it was like 300 degrees in that minnie mouse head ?
so i took it off , you know ? i was gonna have a cigarette .
and some kid took a picture of me .
come on , girls .
these gentlemen have things to discuss . let &apos;s go .
okay . thanks .
nice meeting you guys .
we &apos;ll see you at the bar later .
see you at the bar later .
look , carmine .
you basically know what &apos;s going on
with your dad and johnny ... and us over in jersey .
first let me say , i understand .
i appreciate the respect you &apos;re showing me by coming here ...
and reaching out to me at this time .
always .
i will also go on record as saying ...
i know my old man can be a tough nut to crack .
i don &apos;t want to crack nuts , but i will .
i feel the anger .
when i try , for the second time ...
on a separate issue entirely , to reach an accommodation ...
and he don &apos;t even make a counteroffer , where &apos;s his respect ?
i don &apos;t know what kind of advice he &apos;s getting from johnny .
johnny &apos;s always usually a voice of moderation .
me and him , we get along good .
so , all due respect , let &apos;s not jump in and blame johnny .
true . john &apos;s a pragmatist .
but he &apos;s also a greedy motherfucker .
he lives above his head a little .
i am reminded of louis the whatever &apos;s finance minister :
de @-@ something . he built this chateau . nicole and i saw it when we went to paris .
it even outshone versailles , where the king lived .
in the end , louis clapped him in irons .
look , tony .
all i can promise you is , i will look into it .
i understand you got to try to feel out your old man so he don &apos;t give you &apos; a mazz&apos;
you know , for sticking your nose in .
i haven &apos;t been afraid of my father for quite some time .
fair enough .
but , carmine , bear in mind , he came onto my turf .
he tried to recruit my mulignon .
and worse , he roughed up my appraiser .
if the proper response is not forthcoming in a business @-@ like time frame ...
my next move will not be further conversation .
i get it .
you should know that my next call will be to johnny sack ...
to let him know that we talked . he shouldn &apos;t feel blind @-@ sided .
hello ?
i &apos;m here for the masoner job .
me
