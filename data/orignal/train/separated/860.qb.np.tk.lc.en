there was nothing quite like thanksgiving in the goldberg house .
my mom gave it her heart and soul ,
and all she wanted in return
was her family to sit around the table
and give thanks ... to her .
okay , turkey &apos;s been basted , and the yams are marshmallowed .
my job is done .
maybe it &apos;s time for you to do your jobs
and spend the next few hours thinking about
the thing or person that you &apos;re most thankful for .
bon jovi &apos;s ass .
darryl dawkins .
harrison ford .
he &apos;s indiana jones , han solo ,
and--little @-@ known fact-- he &apos;s a trained carpenter .
he can make us a gazebo .
everyone out . go get dressed
and think about your answers
while i &apos;m here slaving away .
and he was underappreciated in &quot; blade runner . &quot;
harrison ford sucks .
&quot; underappreciated , &quot; you say ?
that does suck .
which none of us should be saying .
that &apos;s a terrible word .
but instead of going upstairs to change ...
we went downstairs ...
to play the greatest sport of all time .
like all bored siblings , my brother and i
invented a ton of different games ...
battle @-@ ball !
but this was our favorite . it was called ...
ball @-@ ball ! yes !
that was on a breakaway , so it &apos;s 6 points
plus a bonus round !
like every game i played with my big brother ,
i had never once won .
it was so bad , the ball @-@ ball trophy
was even named after him .
and the coveted barry cup
once again goes to ...
barry ...
norman ...
goldberg !
hey , hey ! knock it off .
enough with the ball @-@ ball .
your mother told you to get dressed .
she told you , too .
i &apos;m one move away . you &apos;re four !
now move it !
i &apos;m not gonna have you ruin your mother &apos;s thanksgiving .
but it wasn &apos;t us that always ruined thanksgiving .
no , that title went to my uncle marvin .
but , seriously , why do we have to invite him every year ?
&apos;cause marvin &apos;s your brother and the only family you &apos;ve got ?
no . i &apos;ve got you , i got what &apos;s @-@ her @-@ name ,
i got the two morons in the basement .
i &apos;m good .
look , every year you two fight ,
and marvin ends up storming out before we even sit down .
for once , can &apos;t you just take all the negative feelings
and spin them into a positive ?
how ? !
he &apos;s never even had a job .
positive spin-- he &apos;s a free spirit .
you can &apos;t put a price on that .
how &apos;s 900 bucks for starters ?
that &apos;s how much i paid for his bartending school ,
and he flunked out . who does that ?
i &apos;ll tell you who .
tom cruise in the movie &quot; cocktail , &quot;
and you know how that ended for him .
well , actually , i never saw that movie ,
but i assume he won over the whole city
with his fancy drinks .
fine !
when he gets here , i will try and be nice to him .
you know what , hon ? with a new positive attitude ,
i think marvin &apos;s really gonna surprise you .
delorean !
surprise .
what &apos;s up , mur ?
it was thanksgiving day , 1980 @-@ something ,
and i had finally discovered
i had something to talk about with my uncle .
does it have a flux capacitor ?
does it run on 1.21 gigawatts ?
have you been chased by terrorists ?
no , but i have been chased by the ladies ...
&apos;cause it &apos;s a ass magnet !
okay , enough questions .
um , marv , can i get you something to drink ?
uh , no . can i get you something to drink ?
it &apos;s not every day you got a semiprofessional bartender
in your house , am i right ?
hey ! cocktail ! hey ! uh @-@ oh . uh @-@ oh .
ho ! marv @-@ o ! lookin &apos; good !
right back at you . what &apos;s your poison , al ?
i &apos;ll take a gin and tonic .
too hard . pass .
say wine or blue hawaiian .
i really don &apos;t want either one of those .
all right , wine it is . who &apos;s next ?
mur , what can i do you for ?
i &apos;d like to know how you paid for that thing in the driveway .
murray .
what ? ! i &apos;m being positive .
i just want to know about my brother .
uh , uh , no , no , no .
no , no , it &apos;s a perfectly fair question ,
given our history .
you guys aren &apos;t gonna believe me ,
but i actually got a job .
yeah , like those time @-@ shares in sweden that you were selling .
or like that alpaca farm i invested in . how did i do ?
not good . they got sick , they hurt some kids .
sad stuff .
anyways , i got a regular old job .
i wear a suit . i work 9 : 00 to 5 : 00,
just like my big bro here .
speaking of which ...
i want to pay you back . a little bit .
for some of the money that i owe you .
there &apos;s like $ 2,000 in here .
yeah , it &apos;s a drop in the bucket , uh , but it &apos;s a start .
come here . come here .
for the first time ...
come here .
my dad felt something for marvin
he &apos;d never felt before-- pride .
it &apos;s happening !
oh . hey , let &apos;s all sit at the table and give thanks .
right now , before it gets too late .
i have been waiting all month to give this guy
a ride in my car .
mur , what do you say ?
let &apos;s ride .
mur @-@ man !
motorin&apos;
what &apos;s your price for flight
in finding mr. right
you &apos;ll be all right tonight
i do not understand that song .
look at us .
cruisin &apos; around jenkintown like back in the day .
look at us , huh ?
and it &apos;s all thanks to lotions of the oceans .
lotions of the what ?
it &apos;s my new job .
i &apos;m a lotioneer .
i sell these facial creams
and body butters , and they &apos;re infused
with this real sea salt .
beautiful thing , mur-- you take a dab of this stuff ,
you put it on your face ,
and your skin becomes so smooth and soft .
well , whatever it is , good for you .
well , could be good for you .
just a little cash investment ,
you get in on the ground floor of this killer business .
what ?
just this time
you made it sound like it was gonna be different .
it is different .
marvin , i so want to support you ,
but you make it so hard .
you don &apos;t believe me . fine . touch my face .
what ?
stop being so judgy for five seconds ,
and touch my face , and then you will understand
how smooth and delightful my skin is .
touch it .
i don &apos;t want to touch your face .
touch my face !
i don &apos;t even touch my wife &apos;s face .
touch my face !
it &apos;s like i &apos;m all man , except for this one tiny spot .
i &apos;m not touching your face .
it &apos;s like a little baby &apos;s earlobe !
you &apos;re out of your mind .
that &apos;s it ! pull over !
what ?
remove yourself from the cockpit of my car !
my dad wasn &apos;t the only one spending quality time
with his brother .
battle @-@ ball !
yes ! yes !
that &apos;s a left @-@ handed goal ! 2 points for me ,
and barry wins again !
wait , wait , wait , wait , wait . you didn &apos;t call &quot; ball @-@ ball . &quot;
yes , i did .
no , you didn &apos;t . i was sitting right here .
that &apos;s minus 2 points , plus a penalty shot .
line up .
whatever . like it matters .
i didn &apos;t realize it at that moment ,
but as barry covered his groin with a throw pillow ,
our entire power dynamic was about to shift .
head @-@ shot ! 5 points !
nuh @-@ unh ! didn &apos;t hit my head .
uh ... yes , it did . i was just watching .
i just won . i just won !
i just won at ball @-@ ball !
not true ! there &apos;s no way you just won !
i &apos;m pretty sure he just won .
there isn &apos;t a world where this little ,
unathletic , lazy @-@ eyed nerd would beat me .
well , this unathletic , lazy @-@ eyed nerd
is now ball @-@ ball champion !
history had been made ,
and i did what any champion would ...
gloat .
i knew it ! i knew you had an angle !
what ?
you trapped me in your stainless steel box
just to ask me for money !
it &apos;s not asking for money ! i &apos;m only telling you about
the investment opportunity of a lifetime ,
and it &apos;s gonna cost you $ 2,000 .
you just paid me back $ 2,000 !
so you have it !
you have to be the biggest moron of all time .
would a moron drive an awesome car like that ? !
do you have insurance ?
why ? ! no !
oh , my god !
no !
no !
you didn &apos;t put the parking brake on !
moron ! no ! please !
moron ! oh , gosh !
okay . uhh ! it &apos;s just a dent !
it &apos;s just a dent .
you &apos;re lucky this thing was built in america .
you bent the frame !
yep . he bent the frame .
i thought the car looked even more awesome like this .
hey , pal .
but my uncle did not agree .
he bent the frame !
what--really ?
he bent the frame !
now that my dad and uncle marv were getting along ,
my mom was finally gonna get her thanks .
okay , they &apos;re back !
or so she thought .
everyone ...
let &apos;s all sit at the table and say our thanks ...
to whoever that may be .
bevy , i am so sorry .
i know you wanted this year to be different ,
but it turns out
some things never change !
i &apos;ll tell you what &apos;s changed .
i &apos;m never coming back here again .
you say that every year , but you keep showing up !
yeah , well , this time i mean it !
i &apos;m gonna call delorean &apos;s
24 @-@ hour concierge maintenance line ,
come fix my car ...
and then i am so out of here !
no ! no one &apos;s going anywhere !
the turkey &apos;s out of the oven .
we &apos;ve never made it this far !
the number you have called has been disconnected .
what the hell ?
aren &apos;t they out of business ?
what are you talking about ?
it was all over the news .
the owner--john delorean-- he was arrested
for trying to sell two f.b.i. agents
cocaine powder .
what are you saying to me ?
seriously , the negativity in this house is unbelievable !
yo ! ad @-@ rock ! what &apos;s up ?
listen , i &apos;ve given it a lot of thought ,
and i &apos;ve decided to officially acknowledge
that you won the barry cup .
the adam cup .
sure . point is , is i &apos;m being a man
and agreeing that you won .
now you be a man and play me in ball @-@ ball
so i can win the trophy back .
yeah , here &apos;s the thing about that--
i retired .
what ?
i &apos;ve basically done all i needed to do
on the ball @-@ ball court ,
and now i &apos;m looking to the future .
you can &apos;t retire as champion . it makes you champion forever .
ooh , i guess it does .
fine . i &apos;ll beat you at something else .
hockey , basketball , darts ,
uno , clue ,
battleship , arm wrestling ,
thumb wrestling , real wrestling--
just play me in something so i can beat you in it !
are you sure you can beat me ?
or has the power dynamic shifted ,
and you &apos;ll never win anything ever again ?
are you serious right now ?
from now on , you &apos;re not the big brother anymore .
i am .
i will alwaysbe the big brother .
i &apos;ve grown 2 inches this year .
how much have you grown ?
i don &apos;t have to answer that .
get your affairs in order , &apos; cause from now on ,
i &apos;m the man .
now ... leave me to my robot .
while barry &apos;s anger was heating up ,
my mom &apos;s perfect thanksgiving was cooling down .
dude ...
i &apos;m so stuffed !
wait a minute . where are you coming from ?
i just ran over to lainey &apos;s house .
her mom made the most amazing feast .
i need to lie down .
well , you better make room in your body ,
because this thanksgiving is happening .
i gotta be honest with you , bev .
i &apos;m taking a lot of body blows today .
whole lot of body blows .
apparently , in addition to delorean
discontinuing their 24 @-@ hour concierge service ,
now it &apos;s impossible for me to buy spare parts ,
because the company longer exists !
really wish someone would have told me that before i bought the car .
point is , i &apos;m calling a cab .
no ! no cabs !
i just cut the turkey , marvin .
come on .
my mom knew her big thanksgiving thank @-@ you ...
was going down the drain ,
so she decided to use every ounce of manipulation
and emotional blackmail in her arsenal
to make sure that didn &apos;t happen .
she was good cop ...
i know you had a lousy father
and your childhood with marvin was very complicated .
i get it . i am on your side .
she was bad cop ...
i &apos;m getting angry , marvin .
you won &apos;t like me when i &apos;m angry .
she was guilt cop ...
i am this close to giving up as a wife ,
as a mother , and as a human being .
and finally , she was the crooked cop that just plain lied .
you know how prideful murray is .
he literally just told me
he wants to invest in your company ,
but he doesn &apos;t know how to say it .
marvin wants to just move on
and forget he ever mentioned the business to you .
there &apos;s no reason to ever bring it up again .
this is the check from murray . he wants you to have it .
but ...
he also wants you to never mention it .
ever .
my mom had worked her magic , and for a few minutes ,
it was actually like being at a normal thanksgiving .
so there we were , okay ?
connie mack stadium .
sandy koufax just pitched
a no @-@ hitter against our phillies .
he was unbelievable .
we run down from the nose @-@ bleed seats .
that &apos;s all we could afford .
you kids have no idea how good you got it .
sandy is about to go into the dugout .
suddenly , he turns around ,
he looks at us , throws me the ball .
no . he threw me the ball , because i caught it .
he clearly threw it to me ,
which is why dad made you give me the ball .
yeah , the greatest pitcher of all time
from 8 feet away
doesn &apos;t know what kid he &apos;s throwing to ?
okay . keeping it positive .
uh , now &apos;s the time in our dinner
where we &apos;re all going to go around the table
and say what or who we &apos;re most thankful for .
all right ? i &apos;m gonna start .
i &apos;m thankful to be surrounded by my beautiful , loving family .
erica ?
i can &apos;t even talk , i &apos;m so full .
fine . barry , go .
i &apos;m thankful for the game hungry hungry hippos ,
which is set up in the den if anyone wants to play .
i am also thankful for my family ,
which i &apos;ll now list from most to least powerful .
dad , pops , mom , erica ,
me , uncle marv ,
and of course , dead last , barry .
why are you putting me last ? you can &apos;t put me last .
can &apos;t i ?
okay , can we stop arguing
and start thanking someone meaningful ?
someone who &apos;s done a lot for you ?
i &apos;m thankful for a little woman who &apos;s always been there for me ,
not just today , but throughout the years .
lady luck .
without her , the cowboys would never have covered the spread .
you guys really want to know what i &apos;m thankful for ?
of course . come on , don &apos;t hold back .
well , i was told specifically not to mention it--
oh . oh , boy . uh , maybe don &apos;t .
nah , i &apos;m gonna do it .
or not .
i am thankful for my big brother ,
who believed in me enough
to invest in my cosmetics venture .
i what now ?
marvin , i thought we weren &apos;t gonna talk about that .
stop right there .
we &apos;re investing money in stuff ? i &apos;m in .
i love you guys .
and--and you &apos;re gonna love lotions of the oceans .
real sea salt . huh ?
kelp--second ingredient .
i &apos;m gonna go get my samples out of the trunk .
you &apos;re gonna love it .
so ...
anyone else like to give thanks ?
okay , this is our brand @-@ new face revujenator .
i think it &apos;s rejuvenator .
i think i know what revujenator is .
i &apos;m the guy selling the stuff .
i feel younger already . we &apos;re gonna be rich .
i have the cup ! i &apos;m the champion !
that &apos;s not how it works ! give it back !
what were you thinking
giving marvin money behind my back ? !
i &apos;m sorry .
i screwed up . but for a split second ,
i saw you two getting along , and i know you were happy .
fine , i was happy !
but that &apos;s because i thought he &apos;d grown up
and i wouldn &apos;t have to take care of him anymore !
okay ! here you go .
you probably want to clear some space out of your garage ,
because you &apos;re gonna get a delivery
of about , uh , 20 cases of this stuff on monday .
why would i want 20 cases of that crap ?
because you invested . right ?
that &apos;s--that-- that &apos;s the deal .
you--you peddle the creams , and you recruit more people
to expand your sales triangle .
sales triangle ?
wait . is this a damn pyramid scheme ?
no , no ! th @-@ there &apos;s 26 tiers of sales , okay ?
the guys at the top , they make the most money ,
and then it funnels down toward the base
of the three @-@ dimensional triangle .
you literally just described a pyramid , you idiot !
i see what it is .
i &apos;m finally doing well for myself ,
so my brother , of course , thinks it &apos;s some kind of a scam !
murray , stop it ! it &apos;s thanksgiving !
it &apos;s a pyramid !
my face hurts .
it &apos;s burning real bad .
the burning means that it &apos;s working .
it &apos;s working too much ! there &apos;s fire on my face !
okay ... just wipe it off .
it &apos;s thanksgiving .
come back here ! that &apos;s my cup !
come back here ! come back here !
i &apos;m in a great deal of pain now .
you know what ?
get it off !
i don &apos;t care what you people think .
i stand by my product .
then , uh , why don &apos;t you put it on your face ?
what are you doing ?
you wanted me to touch your face so bad in the car .
get away from my face .
you &apos;re taking it out of context .
come on !
that was a different situation !
oh , my god !
get your hand off his face !
it &apos;s thanks ... giving !
no ! oh , my god !
murray !
oh , my god !
it was a sad sight watching my dad and uncle
fight like children ,
but even sadder was that marvin had to ask for a ride home .
i &apos;m gonna send a flatbed over on monday ,
so if it begins to rain ,
please cover the delorean with a tarp or something .
how &apos;s your eye ?
still a little sting @-@ y .
you &apos;re right about me .
i &apos;m a moron .
my car &apos;s a bust , i still live in our parents &apos; house ,
and apparently i &apos;m to stupid to realize
that a triangle is the same shape as a pyramid .
i don &apos;t know , i just wish that once
i could do something that didn &apos;t disappoint you , murray .
what do you care what i think ?
are you serious ? you raised me .
i mean , dad wasn &apos;t there . you were .
you &apos;re the one i look up to .
well , don &apos;t .
i was just doing what i had to do .
yeah , well , you gave up your childhood for me .
don &apos;t think i forgot that .
i was glad to do it .
no , you weren &apos;t .
you &apos;re right .
i would have liked to have gone to my prom .
yeah . i &apos;m sorry i ate that detergent .
it just smelled really good .
look , the poinis , it wasn &apos;t easy looking after you .
but i don &apos;t regret it .
and the only reason i call you a moron ...
is because i want the best for you .
really ?
yeah .
hold on a second , all right ?
don &apos;t go anywhere . i &apos;ll ... i &apos;ll be right back .
turns out it wasn &apos;t the delorean
that forced my dad and his brother to revisit the past .
it was my dad &apos;s crappy old station wagon .
i want you to have that .
the koufax ball ?
yeah .
i can &apos;t !
take it . have a little bit of your childhood back .
we both know that he was throwing it to you .
get your butt in here .
come on . thanksgiving &apos;s not over .
can we talk ?
no .
listen .
after i saw dad and uncle marv acting like morons ,
i thought , maybe i will give you that rematch .
thought you didn &apos;t want to
&apos;cause you &apos;re the big brother now .
oh , come on .
you &apos;ll always be my big brother .
for the first time ever , my mom ended up getting
her perfect thanksgiving .
we even made it to dessert .
hey . can i just , uh , say something here ?
i think we should give mom a big thanks
for working her ass off
and bringing us all together .
hear , hear .
yeah , bev . hear , hear .
that &apos;s--that &apos;s not why i do it ,
but thank you very much .
it &apos;s nice to be appreciated .
as for me and barry ,
a new era of ball @-@ ball had begun ,
and it was anybody &apos;s game .
he shoots ! he scores !
he wins !
ah ! you didn &apos;t say &quot; ball @-@ ball . &quot;
damn it !
okay , look me in the eye .
are you positive that you want to be a serious ,
dedicated , professional bartender ?
uh , maybe ?
good .
i dig the fire in your belly .
okay , rule number one--
always remember , no one cares what their drink tastes like ,
as long as it &apos;s served with flair and panache .
uh , that doesn &apos;t sound right .
it &apos;s okay . follow my lead , okay ?
cocktail ! cocktail !
hey ! who wants--
what the hell &apos;s going on in here ?
nothing . we were just--
are you drinking ? !
no ! i was just--
get your tuchus upstairs now !
move it !
you &apos;re not getting a thing to eat !
you ought to be ashamed of yourself , barry .
he ought to be ashamed of himself !
just a few minutes .
okay , enough of this .
my shoes are soaking wet .
i don &apos;t care !
