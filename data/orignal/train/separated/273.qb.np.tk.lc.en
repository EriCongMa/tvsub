the royal baby smiled at the queen .
i meant at the diner .

and we went from polyester and pitiful to powerful and proud .
just like superman .
except that superman changed in a phone booth ,
not a stall that says , &quot; for a good time , call max . &quot;
well , if you have a problem with it , why did you write it ?
&apos;cause i didn &apos;t have enough eyeliner to write ,
&quot; for an interesting time , call caroline . &quot;
look . look , earl , we &apos;re wearing our
&quot; max &apos;s homemade cupcakes &quot; t @-@ shirts again .
see the logo ?
well , actually , i try never
to look you ladies in the &quot; chestal &quot; area .
it keeps things on the up and up .
oh , earl , you are one in a million , literally ,
&apos;cause 999,999 men have only looked me in that area .
well , i got to go home .
i &apos;m binge @-@ watching dharma and greg on hulu .
oh , i missed so much growing up in korea .
what , like puberty ?
max , in my country , i &apos;m average height .
and in my mind , i &apos;m still rich ,
and my health care plan isn &apos;t flintstones chewables .
so who wants to go in the back
and see how amazing our brand @-@ new cupcake shop is ?
bring down the enthusiasm , rachael ray .
right , we &apos;re not supposed to get all excited about this opening tonight .
last time , we made a big deal ,
and the shop didn &apos;t do so well .
ha ! that &apos;s like saying the people
near the nuclear explosion didn &apos;t do so well .
girls , i am so proud of you two ,
getting back up on that horse .
after my first jazz record didn &apos;t sell ,
i turned to a life of drinks , drugs , and loose women .
funny how sometimes things just work out right .
but how can you be opening your cupcake window right now ?
it &apos;s 2 : 00 a.m.
our hours are 2 : 00 to 4 : 00 .
we &apos;re targeting the &quot; post bars &quot; demographic .
drunk williamsburg guys .
that &apos;s my target when i &apos;m by myself
and now my target at the new shop .
funny how sometimes things just work out right .
we have no big expectations about the opening tonight .
it &apos;s a soft opening .
what &apos;s the difference between a soft one and a hard one ?
you want me to show him ?
thanks , but we &apos;re cool .
seriously , it won &apos;t take me a minute .
it &apos;s fine , oleg .
just so you know , i &apos;m already there .
get ready , this room &apos;s had an amazing transformation .
rachael ray ?
i mean , it &apos;s fine , whatever .
han , before we go in , close your eyes .
i want you to get the full effect .
yeah , and i want to trip you .
she &apos;s kidding .
no , she &apos;s not .
yeah , i &apos;m not .
han , i promise , i won &apos;t let her trip you .
now , close your eyes .
what ?
now , i thought she was going to hit me .
she was not .
yeah , i was .
okay , no more blind eye bull crap .
just show me the damn smelly back room .
let me turn off the lights for a more dramatic impact .
what ? i didn &apos;t do anything .
it was me .
he now knows what hard is .
i cannot believe my eyes .
i felt the same way when i first saw you .
original tan , original tile , original too .
what do you think , oleg ?
nice .
&quot; nice &quot; ? all you got is &quot; nice &quot; &quot;
this place was like great adventure for rats !
they were waiting in line to bite us .
caroline , show them your bite marks .
i &apos;d rather not .
nice ?
it used to smell like the place poop comes to die .
or death comes to poop .
and look what we did ! we created the greatest ,
coolest , chic @-@ est cupcake shop , and i love it !
but you know , no enthusiasm . just a soft opening .
and , han , this was all possible
because you gave us the space rent @-@ free .
rent @-@ free ? now , refresh my memory .
when exactly did i say &quot; rent @-@ free ? &quot;
on the 27th , 4 : 15 p.m. , you said ,
&quot; i don &apos;t care about that dump , you can have it for free .
burn it to the ground , for all i care . &quot;
i knew learning english would come back to bite me in the ass .
soone &apos;s already knocking ?
that &apos;s a really great sign , max .
time to open .
look , girls , i &apos;m blowing this party horn for you .
thanks , sophie , but we didn &apos;t want to make a big deal ,
it &apos;s a soft opening .
oh , i love a soft opening .
hello , sophie .
oh , hello , oleg .
sorry , sophie , about this uncomfortable meeting .
if we had known you were going to surprise us ,
we wouldn &apos;t have invited oleg .
yeah , i was there when you two broke up
and i &apos;m still suffering from ptsd .
&quot; post @-@ traumatic sophie drama . &quot;
there &apos;s no drama .
and the award for the best drama goes to ...
not us . right , oleg ?
yes , we &apos;re friends now .
see , girls , i cheated on her ,
so she smashed in my car windows .
and my apartment windows .
and your stereo and your flat screen .
and my brother &apos;s flat screen and his daughter &apos;s computer .
yeah , she surprised me .
she wasn &apos;t supposed to be home .
we got it out of our systems . good night , friend .
good night , friend .
and , oleg ?
that is one lucky horn .
honey , look . look , some customers .
hey , cool guys !
come over here and eat something from the girls &apos; soft opening !
that is so not the way i would &apos;ve gone ,
but i &apos;ll take it .
hello , hello .
what have we got here ?
welcome to max &apos;s homemade cupcakes .
in england we call &apos; em &quot; fairy cakes . &quot;
fairy cakes ? damn it .
why are the hot ones always gay ?
here you go darling , give us the whole lot .
oh , my god !
a black american express card ?
i haven &apos;t held a black one in my hands in years .
i would &apos;ve guessed you hadn &apos;t held a black one ever .
sorry , it &apos;s our first night . cash only .
oh , wow . he is really out of it .
what is he on ?
besides me later ?
do not know , but am jealous .
and now i &apos;m really jealous .
i &apos;m sure he &apos;ll be fine .
oh , i &apos;d say he &apos;s more than fine .
i &apos;d say he &apos;s my next boyfriend .
roland , mate , wake up .
he &apos;s not breathing .
i can &apos;t wake him , call 911 !
call 911 !
let &apos;s all just calm down .
i have seen this happen a lot .
one summer i had a part @-@ time job
as a lifeguard at a crack house .
he &apos;ll come to in a second .
he &apos;s dead .
called that wrong .
max , the guy who died in front of our shop last night
was a rock star .
he used to date kate moss .
no offense , but dating kate moss
is like a law in england .
everyone has to do it when they turn 21 .
his name was roland gass , and he has two gold records .
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;ve never heard of him .
i can .
your go @-@ to jam is the soundtrack from newsies .
yesterday a rock star , and today he &apos;s gone .
you never know .
that &apos;s why i ordered us breakfast
from the fancy breakfast place on the corner .
you ordered from magna cum latte ?
every day when i pass by it , i think two things :
one , i wish i had a gun .
and , two , someday i &apos;m gonna order breakfast to be delivered
with one of their fancy @-@ ass croissants .
who knows , tonight i could do too much heroin
and die an unexpected death .
but at least then i &apos;d die doing something my mother loved .
you &apos;re right , max . you only live once .
yolo .
and you only live till the next time you say &quot; yolo . &quot;
oh , no . more bad news .
according to my google alert for max &apos;s homemade cupcakes-
you have a google alert for our business ?
i only have a google alert for &quot; oprah goes topless . &quot;
i &apos;m not saying it &apos;s gonna happen ,
but i &apos;m saying , if it does ,
i &apos;m gonna be the first one to know .
look , it &apos;s online that roland glass died in front of our shop .
and now my phone just died . it &apos;s an epidemic .
oleg , what are you still doing with the arrow from our shop ?
i thought you said that was hung .
no , i said i was hung .
and i can &apos;t put it up now
with that crowd of people in front of your window .
there are people in front of our window ?
dude , is this where my man roland died ?
yeah , right over there .
then i &apos;m gonna put this here next to paddington bear .
i caught this at his last concert .
and i also caught this .
so , like , what , dude ? he just dropped to the ground ?
actually , he hit right here first , smiled , then fell .
he smiled ? dude .
max , can i see you over here ?
sorry for your loss . and dope hat .
thanks . i found it in a dumpster .
max , what are you doing ?
don &apos;t tell them he hit our counter .
we need to distance ourselves from the entire event .
this spells disaster for our new business .
dude , can i get three dozen cupcakes ?
or it spells success .
i have beaucoup friends coming here for the midnight vigil .
how much are your cupcakes ?
$ 7 .
that &apos;s a lot .
dude . roland would &apos;ve wanted it that way .
* knock , knock , knocking on heaven &apos;s door *
and he hit right here before he fell .
and as he fell , he looked up at me and smiled .
content . peaceful .
that &apos;ll be $ 7 , cash only .
mira , can you break a 50 ?
max !
yeah , what do you need ?
change for a 50 .
got it .
i mean , why , god , why ?
* knock , knock , knocking on heaven &apos;s door *
ten , ten , ten , ten .
* heaven &apos;s door *
max , we &apos;re almost sold out in here .
i need more cupcakes from the kitchen .
got it .
i &apos;ll come right in .
earl ?
same split as before . 30 cents on every dollar you sell .
what a waste .
you know how much money we could make if we sold pot ?
oh , you want in on that too ? same split .
oh , man , that hippie patchouli smell
is worse than the poop was .
han , shh . these people are in mourning .
show some respect .
me ? me show some respect ?
what will you two do next ,
sell cupcakes at the diabetes wing at the children &apos;s hospital ?
how dare you doubt my sincerity ?
i personally have shooed a homeless man
away from peeing on that shrine twice .
i don &apos;t care what i may or may not have said
on the 27th at 4 : 15 p.m.
your business is booming , and now i want rent .
no way , han . that man could &apos;ve overdosed anywhere .
but god made him overdose in front of our window as a gift .
and , yes , we are accepting that gift because you only live once .
yolo .
this isn &apos;t &quot; yolo , &quot; it &apos;s &quot; hodo &quot; &quot;
he only died once .
i &apos;m surprised you aren &apos;t selling &quot; hodo &quot; t @-@ shirts .
how dare you again ?
we are simply providing some comfort food
to people who need comfort .
and , i might add , we are doing it with the utmost respect .
* knock , knock , knocking on the apple store &apos;s door *
that &apos;s it , your business is booming ,
i want rent . 200 .
a year ?
a month , and it &apos;s a bargain for my beautiful space .
this space is only beautiful because we made it beautiful .
yeah , show &apos; em your bite marks !
max , i &apos;d rather not .
you will pay me $ 200 a month ,
and there is nothing you can do to change my mind !
show him your bite marks !
fine !
a rat bit her ass ?
okay , 195 .
no rent , han . that wasn &apos;t the deal you made us .
this is not personal , it &apos;s business .
i want a slice of grief pie !
show him your front bites !
no ! that &apos;s too personal .
sorry you had to do that .
so am i.
it &apos;s healing nicely .
don &apos;t lie to me .
i think it &apos;s nice of us to add our flowers to the others .
shows respect .
you &apos;re acting like you didn &apos;t steal them .
max , it &apos;s the thought that counts .
and i thought it &apos;d be cheaper to pull them out of someone &apos;s garden .
wait , where &apos;s the shrine ?
look , han moved it over to the diner door .
that insolent charlatan !
whatever that means .
* knock , knock , knocking on heaven &apos;s door *
can you believe this , girls ?
he &apos;s cashing in on a man &apos;s death .
without us .
and in his honor , tonight we are serving
chicken a la roland !
at a mourner &apos;s discount of just $ 8.95 .
looks like jiminy cricket turned to the dark side .
i also have rock star pudding .
nope . no way , max . this is our shrine .
grab a handful of bears .
we &apos;re moving the dead guy shrine back ?
wait , let me just light a candle for my dignity .
it died here too .
max , do you want to be successful or not ?
because if you do , grab one of these poems
that doesn &apos;t follow any of the rules of poetry ,
and move it back to the cupcake window .
because this is our death .
i think maybe you &apos;re being a little harsh .
&quot; rock out in heaven . love , kevin . &quot;
that &apos;s gold .
oops , knocked over a candle .
ooh , small fire , small fire .
fire on my shoe .
if i don &apos;t get this out , it &apos;s gonna be my memorial service .
look , look .
those girls are disrupting the shrine of a dead man !
look , look , a roach got out of the diner !
quick , step on it !
look , hippies , look ! put down those bongs and look .
they &apos;re moving the place where a man died
for their own financial gain !
hey , that &apos;s so not cool , man .
yeah , come on .
yeah , boo !
he &apos;s the not cool one .
yeah , look at him !
roland glass died a horrible death
in front of our adorable cupcake window .
see ? &quot; horrible , adorable &quot; ?
that rhyme just came right off the top of my head .
hey ! hi . hi .
he knows !
i told him to stop peeing on the shrine
when it was still over there !
isn &apos;t that right ?
yep . that &apos;s the bitch .
yes ! yes ! i &apos;m the bitch !
so not cool , dude . let &apos;s get him out of here .
no ! stop !
that &apos;s my wallet !
ooh , stop ! that &apos;s not my wallet .
stop !
stop !
cast of rock of ages , stop !
put him down . he &apos;s cool .
even with those clothes and that head .
i mean , really .
are we that desperate for success ?
we &apos;d let han be torn apart ?
i &apos;m thinking .
caroline-
max , i &apos;m thinking .
well , no one &apos;s knock , knock ,
knocking on our door now .
it &apos;s more dead out there
than when there was a dead guy out there .
i &apos;m having second thoughts about how we behaved today .
i mean , how could we have let han live ?
hello .
i brought you some rock star pudding to say thank you .
oh , rock star pudding . what &apos;s in it , pills ?
broken dreams ? tear @-@ stained panties ?
caroline ?
i &apos;m not as easy as max .
said every girl in my seventh grade class .
look , i was wrong .
no , han , i was .
we should pay rent .
i wasn &apos;t talking about the rent .
rent ? who said anything about rent ?
i was wrong when i said
it wasn &apos;t personal , it was business .
after max stopped me from being torn
limb from limb by the smelly hippies ,
i realized , with us , it is mostly personal .
and a little business .
a little business ?
what other kind could you have ?
max , let &apos;s not be hard on han .
he &apos;s giving us this space rent @-@ free .
no one said &quot; rent @-@ free . &quot;
i came up with a number i think is fair .
$ 250,000 .
yeah , sounds fair .
i remembered that was your original cupcake shop goal .
so when you hit that amount , we can talk rent .
han , that is so sweet .
and i &apos;m not gonna ruin it by bringing up the fact
that she just said &quot; hard on han . &quot;
really , han , it &apos;s so , so generous .
but i don &apos;t know if we &apos;re comfortable with it .
what if we offered you a small piece of the business ?
i &apos;ll wait for the rent . you two are good friends .
a woman finally offers han a piece ,
and he turns it down .
max . google alert .
oprah &apos;s topless ?
max , let that go . that &apos;s never gonna happen .
not with that attitude .
no , the autopsy says roland glass
choked on a max &apos;s homemade cupcake .
this is a disaster .
hey , where &apos;s your enthusiasm now , miss rachael ray ?
this place is the balls !
and it &apos;s just a matter of time
till those sicko hipsters are lining up
for &quot; one of those cupcakes that killed that dude &quot; &quot;
open the window ! we &apos;re back , baby !
but we can &apos;t count on a guy dying every week .
i mean , i have a positive attitude ,
but that &apos;s too pollyanna .
we don &apos;t have to .
that &apos;s what &apos;s so great about this window .
who knows what &apos;ll happen ?
right , and we won &apos;t have to chase business down
because we &apos;ll be right here on the street
waiting for it to come to us .
max , i feel so good about the possibilities .
one night it could be a black american express card ,
and the--
max , is it ...
other nights , it &apos;s a friendly little visit
from our homeless guy .
