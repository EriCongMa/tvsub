The Harper Avery
is one of the highest awards a surgeon can earn.
They always make the calls to the nominees
on the same friday of the same month
at 8 a.m. east coast time...
5 a.m. in Seattle.
Crap, Mer!
Oh, my god! The phone!
Oh! Mer!
Oh! I'm sorry!
Oh, the phone! No, the phone.
Okay, okay, okay. - Did we remember to --
No, no, it's -- it's -- it's charged. - Oh, god!
It's -- it's charged, and the ringer's on.
Okay, hold on. You got to put on some lipstick. Here.
My mother was nominated five times.
I've been through this before.
What if -- - No, it's not possible, because Catherine Avery said
that you were on the short list,
and your project is -- it's innovative. - Uh-huh.
It's gonna lead to the actual printing of hearts.
Uh-huh.
Millions will be saved.
What time is it?
5:01.
Did they?
Not yet.
Did they?
NO.
Oh, god!
Okay, listen, if there are five nominees,
It's alphabetical.
Yang is last.
Oh!
Oh, geez, hairball!
Oh, sorry!
It's Shane. What are you --
Hey. No. Uh, not yet, but it's still early.
It's, uh...
5:02.
If the phone rings, everything changes.
Suddenly, you're a superstar.
If it doesn't...
I don't know.
My mom was a superstar.
She always got the call.
Mer, seriously, what if they don't call?
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
What do I do?
Answer it.
It's Boston. It's Boston. It's them. It's them. It's them.
Okay.
Wait, wait, wait. Okay. Okay.
You are gonna be gracious and humble.
You are gonna thank them, but you are not gonna grovel.
You remember who you are.
You are Cristina Yang,
And you are going to change the face of medicine.
Go.
Just answer the damn phone!
Oh, shh! Quiet! Shh! Shh!
Stay still.
Hello?
Yes, this is Cristina Yang.
He said "We"?
You're sure Shane said "We"?
He said, "Did we get the nomination?"
The way he sees it, he and Yang just got nominated
for the highest surgical honor in the land.
He's gonna be insufferable now.
We have to knock him down a peg. He's still your swap monkey.
I can't do that today. I'm not that horrible.
You kind of are.
Hey, Frankie.
Hey.
Cristina got nominated!
This is her getting the call.
She's wearing lipstick at 5:00 a.m.?
That's cute.
Hey, Frankie.
We got a round soon, so don't be late.
Okay.
All right, I'm gonna get these guys into daycare,
and then I'll see you at the meg.
All right. I'll meet you there.
See you.
Yeah.
You guys got a meg?
Yeah, it's gonna make screening candidates
for the trial so much more efficient.
Doesn't that cost like a jillion dollars?
Yeah. Derek working for the government has its perks.
Oh, you want a Harper Avery.
Um, I want to make an amputee walk using robotics,
and if I win a Harper Avery in the process,
I won't turn it down.
Well, now's the time.
I mean, Sofia's almost in school all day,
And the time-consuming baby days are over.
Unless they're not.
Oh, I say we quit while we're ahead.
Yeah. Yeah. Sofia's pretty perfect.
Why tempt fate?
Yeah, and I can actually finally have a thought.
Mm. Is that thought "Where's my Harper Avery?"
Ooh. Hey, maybe.
Ooh. All right. Maybe.
Hey, Frankie.
Morning, Dr. Avery.
Hey, are you named after that big award -- the Harper Avery?
It's actually named after me, after my family.
How did you hear... about --
Okay.
Hey.
Hey. Did you go home? I must have missed you.
Yeah, I had a 14-year-old GSW. It was so bloody.
I felt nasty after surgery, so I went home to change.
Cool news about Yang, though, huh?
Yeah.
You really didn't know?
I'm telling you, the nominating committee
is totally separate from the foundation.
I'm just like everybody else.
Hmm. Only way handsomer.
Mm.
Is that a swimsuit?
Yes, I ran out of clean underwear
and haven't had a chance to do laundry.
Which is why you send it out.
We have a perfectly good washing machine at the house.
Says the doctor in a speedo.
Paying someone to do your laundry is an extravagance.
How much did that coffee cost?
Uh, 4 bucks.
So, that's like, what, six -- six a week?
Mm-hmm. Carry the... that's like... give me a second.
Like $1,000 a year you're just throwing away.
It's not like I'm spending it on hookers or private planes.
It's a latte.
I'm gonna get you one of those milk-frothy things.
I'm gonna teach you how to make your own latte.
Will you do it in that swimsuit?
Hmm? Stop.
Okay, so, there was a gang shooting last night,
so the E.R's crazy.
And that premie I told you about -- she gained 2 ounces,
And the nurses are like, "Doesn't she look fat?"
And I'm like, "No, she looks like a naked mole rat."
And, uh, my doctor got nominated for some prize,
and everyone's really jealous.
That's cool.
Not as cool as that.
Yeah.
My parents try to distract me
from the fact that I'm trapped in a bubble.
Well, aren't you getting some test results back today
that are gonna get you out?
Yeah.
Here they come.
Come visit me.
My brother's room is end of the hall on the right.
Well, there he is.
Hey, Bradie bug.
Braden.
Up high, champ.
Hi, baby.
Mom, why are you crying?
Oh, I'm...
I'm not.
I'm sorry. I can't.
Um, unfortunately, your t-cell count is still zero.
Your infection is almost cleared,
but we were hoping for your t-cell count to respond.
I get it.
But I don't understand why my mom's crying.
There's got to be other stuff you guys can try.
You're not gonna make me live in this bubble for the rest of my life.
Dad?
Uh, it's not so simple, bud.
Your body has no ability to fight infection,
And the enzyme's not working anymore.
Bone-marrow transplants in kids with scid can be effective,
so we're still looking for a match.
They've been looking for a match for me since I was a baby,
and they haven't found one.
What if you still can't?
No other treatment for your disease exists.
We're working on it, but for the time being...
Your only safe place is right where you are.
Hey, Frankie. You're late.
I'm not a patient anymore, so I don't have to be at rounds.
But you do.
Oh. You're right. I'm late.
Want to race?
Yeah. Come on.
Oh, oh, oh! I got you!
Come on! Come on!
Slow down!
That's not fair! Come on!
Hey, Linkie.
I got you a chocolate-
chip muffin for when you're feeling better.
Well, how are you feeling, Frankie?
Well, she just beat me in a race, so...
Oh, looks like that pacemaker I put in is working.
And iv--
Seriously, Ivy.
Sour-cream-and-onion chips for breakfast?
You said I should put on weight.
Mmm. Good.
So, two weeks post-op heart transplant,
and Ivy's indices are excellent.
And Mr. Link?
Lincoln McNeil, age 9, end-stage heart failure,
Awaiting transplant, status 1A.
There's a family history of the disease.
The cause is still unknown.
Uh, Link first showed signs of cardiomyopathy two weeks ago
and has deteriorated rapidly.
An attempt to put him on a Berlin heart failed...
due to something I can't remember.
Clotting.
That's it.
Uh, the patient is now on ECMO and is...
Stable.
I couldn't have said it better myself.
Thanks. So, where are we with UNOS?
Well, Link is at the top of the list.
How much longer can he survive on ECMO?
Well, with sweep numbers this low...
at least a week.
So, we pray for a miracle?
We got one with Ivy.
We're not just sitting around and waiting.
We are aggressively looking at other options.
In the meantime...
...heart-healthy food, okay?
So, I put a call in to these guys from Stanford
who are doing animal testing with a drug-eluting pump
to prevent clotting.
Never been tried on humans, but Link is a little kid.
The fit might be right. It could work.
I'll let you guys know what they say.
So, that's how you're gonna play this --
Act like it's just another day at the office?
It is.
No, see I need details.
So, w-what did they say?
"Congratulations."
And then what did you say?
"Thank you."
Cristina, I just don't -- - No, no, really, really,
It's -- it's just a nomination.
I'm happy about it, but I've got a ton of work to do.
I-I want to focus on that.
I really don't want to make a big deal out of it.
Hey, hey. Uh...let's go this way. Yeah.
You know, get some...breakfast? Mm.
Why? I got my chips.
Surprise!
Whose idea was this?
Meredith's.
Congratulations.
第十季 第十九集
"I'm Winning"
Innovation. Imagination. Excellence.
Oh, soak it in, doctors.
It's -- it's all around you.
It's mostly hovering around Dr. Yang,
and Shane's kind of hogging her.
I'm not just talking about Dr. Yang.
Dr. Shepherd is testing a new machine
that can read emotions and has applications
for the work that he and Dr. Torres are doing.
Torres! Me!
Hey, Dr. Grey is about to do the first
HIV-positive-to-positive kidney transplant in the state
since the new law went into effect in November.
That's history in the making. It's mine.
A-and dr. Bailey's looking for
a genetic cure for a kid who lacks an immune system.
Edwards?
I was on her service yesterday. She's not doing anything.
She's just staring at her computer screen.
That is not nothing. She's thinking.
H-her brain is turning,
building up to that moment of -- of inspiration.
It'll look like nothing, but in a moment,
POW! 4th Of July.
Don't blink. You'll miss it.
It was like that with me and Yang at first, too.
A lot of staring at computer screens,
and now look at us.
Oh, Shane.
Oh, Shane, Shane, Shane.
No.
I wasn't gonna do this to you today.
I really wasn't. Was I, ladies?
She wasn't. Hand to god.
But you just got too big for your britches.
It's not even interesting stuff.
I'm just in the printing lab making sample conduits.
Well, not anymore, swap monkey!
Enjoy working with Dr. Bailey.
POW! 4th OF July!
Sucks.
Swap monkey!
Okay, guys, bear with me.
I know we've gone through all this before,
but the hospital just needs your consent one more time.
Go ahead, Murphy. State your name.
Keith Kalber.
Keith, you understand that the kidney you're getting today
is being donated from a person infected with hIV?
I should hope so.
I was there the day he got his diagnosis.
And although small, there is a risk of superinfection
by mixing his strain of the virus with yours.
Knowing this, do you still wish to proceed?
I do.
God, it feels like we're getting married.
How would you know how that feels?
Excuse me?
He always has the best boyfriends,
but he refuses to commit.
Can we just get back to my huge sacrifice?
Marty you understand
that the risks of donation are similar to those involved
with any major surgery, such as bleeding and infection?
And death resulting from kidney donation
is extremely rare.
Define..."extremely."
Uh, .06%.
Oh.
We've beaten worse odds.
Oh, yeah.
Now, before we drill into someone's brain,
we need to make sure they're good candidates for robotics work.
They need to be motivated, stable,
and neurologically healthy.
This machine gives us a window into all that.
Mm-hmm. Yeah, you're gonna be our baseline.
So, we're just gonna show you some pictures,
And all you need to do is look at them.
Okay, Wilson, you ready?
Mm. That's the amygdala, right?
It's fired up by powerful negative emotions,
like fear, rage, anger, hate.
Okay, now let's take a look
at her nucleus accumbens.
Her pleasure center?
Mm-hmm.
Hmm.
That's not supposed to happen.
Wilson, what's wrong with you? You don't like cats?
Hate 'em.
What's wrong with the beach?
Sand in my eyes, skin cancer,
vacations I never got to take as a child.
Uh-oh. Open, comminuted radius fracture in the E.R.
There we go. Look at that.
Took a broken arm to make her happy.
Huh.
I turned her on to ortho a few weeks ago. Watch this.
Hey, Wilson, you want to go set that arm yourself?
I love our new toy.
Yang get too fancy for you,
kicked you down here to the "B" Team?
Oh, no. I, uh wanted to see the work you're doing.
Genome sequencing is the future of medicine.
May not be a fancy surgery, but it's gonna save lives.
You want to save lives or go to fancy award dinners?
Save lives.
Don't get me wrong.
I'm happy for Dr. Yang. Why wouldn't I be?
I trained her, molded her.
It's almost like it's my nomination, too.
Keith and Marty are good to go.
Ah, yes -- your high-profile kidney transplant.
I thought you were harvesting the donor.
Yeah, while you do the award-winning stuff.
Uh, yeah, I remember.
Page me when you're ready.
Trained her, too.
Thank you so much for getting back to me.
I hear you're developing, uh, a drug-eluting cardiac pump
that's getting excellent results in sheep.
Oh. Yes, that's me.
Uh, well, there are four other excellent surgeons
who are nominated.
Thank you. Um...
Uh, yes. Anyway, I have a young patient.
He's on day 10 of ecmo
and has, uh, protein "S" deficiency.
Sorry?
I'm 3-D printing, uh, conduits for HLHS patients.
Uh-huh. Yeah.
Uh, well, I think my patient would be an excellent candidate
for a compassionate release.
In here.
I-I see.
Oh, god. Oh, no, no, no. What?
The little boy's ecmo circuit clotted off,
and he's not responding to fluids.
Um, page Dr. Hunt and, um, Dr. Robbins.
Okay, let's get him off that bed...
Dr. Yang?
Dr, Yang, is everything all right?
Dr, Yang? Hello?
She can't talk right now.
He's clotting, even on the heparin.
I can't give him any more or he'll bleed out,
and I can't give him any less or he'll keep clotting.
We need the stanford artificial heart.
We can't have it.
What?
It's not them. They want to let us try.
It's the FDA.
They're being conservative
and insisting on one more animal trial.
They're six months away from approval.
Okay, so what do we do?
We hope UNOS calls.
Today.
Yeah.
Okay, time to get you prepped and ready for --
I can't do it.
Uh, Keith's right.
I mean, w-w-w-we've beaten huge odds.
I mean, we're still alive while so many of our friends died.
And I've been healthy for so long now.
Y-- you get a little cocky.
You forget how lucky you are.
And I...
I-I'm the most horrible friend, but I just...
I'm scared.
W-what if I'm one of the .06%?
I-I-I don't think I can give him my kidney.
Have you told Keith?
H-h-he's been suffering for so long,
a-and when the law was passed, he was so happy.
And then I turned out to be a perfect match.
A-and now...
How can I look my best friend in the eye
and tell him I won't save his life?
It is unfortunate, but...it does happen.
We misread the screening, and it turns out
that Marty is not a suitable donor.
I don't understand.
Yeah, uh, this is outrageous.
I'm -- I-I'm -- I'm completely shocked.
So were we.
Shocked and disappointed.
So, what now?
Well, you'll continue on dialysis
and go back on the transplant list.
You know, it's ironic.
I spend years fighting HIV.
I get myself to the point
where the virus is virtually nonexistent in my body.
I survive.
And now I die of kidney disease.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so, so sorry.
It's not your fault. You tried.
You -- you -- you stepped up.
Oh, god.
I don't know what I would do without you.
What do you do for a living?
I'm an orthopedic surgeon.
Do you enjoy your work?
I love it.
Are you married?
Yep.
Any kids?
Uh, one.
Would you consider yourself a happy person?
Extremely.
And you want to participate in this project?
I do.
No.
"No" What?
Uh, judging by these results, I'd say you are depressed,
and I would turn you away from the study.
I'm not depressed.
Oh, it's no big deal.
We can get somebody else to give us a baseline --
Derek, I'm not depressed.
Show me the kitten.
Yeah. See?
I'm happy.
Am I happy?
Nope.
Well...
Okay, well, uh --
No! Why are you --
I -- I really do love kittens.
I do.
Hey, Dr. Torres said you have a thing for bones.
When you're done with her patient,
you want to do a mandibular O.R.I.F.?
Yes!
I see you have another beverage.
Iced tea, actually. It's quite good.
Would you like some?
Oh, I'm perfectly happy with my water.
Is that a -- - her swimsuit. Yeah. Racerback.
I ran out of underwear.
I'm not understanding.
You don't wear swimsuits
when you run out of clean underwear?
I don't run out of clean underwear.
You're a resident. When do you have time to do laundry?
I'm a doctor. I send it out.
The incision looks good.
Where are my parents?
They went to check out a support group we have
for dealing with tough stuff.
I'm the one who's stuck in here.
You want to talk about it?
No.
Want to play checkers?
No.
Chess?
No.
Come on. You got to let me beat you at something.
I kind of feel like playing with someone my own age.
Whoa! Whoa! Careful.
You're gonna rip through the plastic.
That's the point.
Surgery's off.
It's off?
Donor backed out.
Please tell Cristina I'm thrilled for her.
I'm sure she'd love to hear it from you.
And I would love to have that conversation,
but I am busy trying to find a way
for a gene to proliferate in the body of a young boy.
So I would be most grateful if you would extend
my heartfelt congratulations to Dr. Yang for me.
Um...okay.
You said he was stable.
You said he had at least one more week on ECMO.
W-we thought that we had it under control,
and we didn't expect for him to clot.
And six months ago, I didn't expect any of this.
I was in a carpool line picking up
my three happy, healthy kids from school.
And now --
Now I have two kids in end-stage heart failure
And one-- one being kept alive with a pacemaker.
You guys can't tell me why my kids are sick,
and-- and now you're scratching your heads,
telling me that there's nothing more you can do for Link
except-- except for wait?
I thought you were supposed
to be some award-winning doctor.
Frankie.
My parents keep saying you're doing your best,
but your best is bad.
Frankie, wait!
Frankie!
Dr. Yang?
I'm a...intern here.
I just want to say congratulations.
You are totally gonna win.
Are you from the future?
No.
Then shut up.
She means "Thank you."
Anybody want some meatloaf?
Isn't that the meatloaf you had yesterday?
Yep. And the day before that.
Probably gonna have it tomorrow, too,
'Cause there's still a piece left at home.
Jackson doesn't eat leftovers, you see.
He says he finds it depressing
to eat food out of a tupperware container.
You know what I find depressing?
Paying $7 for a hamburger.
Make her stop.
Her, too.
Hey.
It was low blood sugar, Shepherd.
Take that food to go. We're gonna do this again.
Come on! Come on! Let's go!
There she is.
The future of medicine.
How's it feel?
I don't want to talk about it.
O-kay.
Your mother was the same way.
Didn't you have that meatloaf yesterday?
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yep.
And the day before that.
And probably gonna have it tomorrow.
Dr. Grey?
You're gonna kill me.
I'm gonna thank my parents, obviously.
Why? They didn't help you win the Harper Avery.
They gave birth to me.
They should be publicly acknowledged.
I don't have parents,
so I'm not gonna waste any of my speech on them.
It's gonna be all about me. Humble but...
Self-involved.
Exactly.
Can you stop?
What's wrong, Shane?
Swap monkey misses his conduits?
Please-- swap back.
Bailey says she's on the verge.
No, Bailey's been on the verge for days.
I'm keeping Yang.
Where is it?!
What are you looking for?
I'm looking for a picture of the Harper Avery.
It's my screen saver.
I know what the Harper Avery looks like.
I'm looking for a picture of Ellis Grey's Harper Avery.
Why?
I remember being in medical school
and looking at these old medical journals
and seeing a picture of her from the first time she won.
She was young. She was like 35 or something.
I'm almost 35.
You're 27.
My life is stupid and ordinary.
And...I don't even know what I'm doing here.
I'm never gonna win a Harper Avery.
I might as well just move to a farm and grow vegetables.
At least I'd be doing something useful.
Her transplant got canceled.
You want to be on Bailey?
Oh, my god. Oh, my god!
Oh, my god!
Ooh! Fries! Yeah!
The surgery is back on?
Well, kind of.
Marty felt terrible, so he's back on board.
But we told Keith that they weren't a good match.
You did what?
They're best friends, and I was trying to help.
You got emotionally involved. Rookie mistake.
I am not a rookie.
But I don't know how I'm gonna go back and explain this.
Oh, I do.
Dr. Grey misread the labs.
Her relative inexperience led to a terrible error.
You two are, in fact, a perfect match.
I mean, this is such great news.
So sorry, Keith.
I'm willing to just put all this behind me and move forward.
Well, you know how these young surgeons are.
It's all about P.R. and awards, and they get sloppy.
He said he's ready to move forward.
Luckily, I'm available to do your transplant,
and I assure you I am substance over flash.
I thought you were doing Marty's surgery.
Well, I-I-I don't mind taking Dr. Grey.
Well, why should you settle?
Well, she's, you know, just taking out my kidney.
How hard could it be, you know?
But she can barely read a lab report.
You don't know if she's gonna
mistake your gallbladder for your kidney.
Guys, I assure you-- I'm an excellent surgeon.
Why don't I get another doctor to do Marty's surgery?
What?!
...A good idea.
Yes.
Yes.
Thank you.
Listen, we need this device.
This will buy the kid time until a heart becomes available.
That's crap! You're the FDA!
You make the rules!
I just set a broken radius
and assisted on mandibular O.R.I.F.
How great is this day?
Mm. My kid's trapped in a bubble for the rest of his life.
You and Bailey will figure it out.
That's how great this day is.
Imagination and innovation are everywhere.
I'm seeing a lot of misery and failure.
Alex.
Should I take the private-practice job?
I thought you'd already decided
that you were gonna call Dr. Butthole and --
So Yang's winning awards, and I'm selling out?
You're not a sellout for taking a job
doing something that you love.
Private practice was never the plan.
It was never supposed to be about the money.
Well, there's nothing wrong with making money.
What am I gonna buy?
A condo in aspen? I don't even ski.
Not everyone who's rich is an ass.
You could take the job and not be an ass.
Braden?
Braden!
Braden!
Braden, where are you?!
Where is he?! Where is my son?!
We can't find him!
Braden!
Whoa! Whoa! Watch it!
I'm gonna get you!
No, you're not!
No running in the hall.
I got you!
No, you didn't!
You're totally it.
Frankie! Don't touch him!
Braden!
You can't. He's immuno-compromised.
Any more exposure--
even breathing on him-- puts him at risk.
Can everyone please step away from the boy?
My little guy.
Okay, son. Don't worry.
We love you so. It's okay, son, all right?
Don't worry.
Don't worry.
We're gonna be right here.
We're not going anywhere.
You're so strong.
Don't worry.
Mommy and daddy are here, okay?
We're right here, son.
Don't worry.
Braden told me he was fine.
Mom...
Is Link gonna die?
I-I hope not.
But he's really sick.
He's even worse than Ivy was,
and you remember how bad she was?
What?
I have some good news.
It was a no. It was a hard no.
And then I realized that Frankie was right.
You are a big-time doctor.
So I told them that you were about to win a Harper Avery.
They placed the cardiac pumps in 10 sheep hearts,
and 9 out of the 10 worked without clotting.
It's brilliant.
They put me on hold and then came back a few minutes later
and said okay.
Just like that -- boom. Suddenly, you have clout.
Suddenly, you can get things done.
Using the sheep was perfect.
Their hearts are about the same size as Link's.
Parents signed consent.
They put the device on the next plane.
I got Wilson coordinating with the airlines.
How the hell did you talk the FDA into doing that?
You're not gonna believe this.
Okay. It was a no. It was a hard no. And then --
Quiet! Please!
I've got about four hours to get through all their research.
Can you please take the party outside?
San Francisco's fogged in.
They've grounded all commercial flights
for at least another couple of hours.
Well, he's getting worse.
I don't think that he has that kind of time.
Let's go.
Ross will transport the kidney once I take it out,
and then you'll join me for the transfer.
Roger that.
You okay, Ross? You got this?
Ross!
Swap monkey. You can have your conduits back.
I'm good.
No. Hey, unh-unh! I called swap monkey.
Don't you go into that O.R. Don't you dare!
Too late!
Damn it, Ross.
Hi.
I was --
Never mind.
W-what's a swap monkey?
It's when you want what someone else has.
San Jose airport's open.
There's a flight that connects through Portland.
It can be here in six hours.
That's still too long.
I'm telling you, private charter is the only way this will work.
Yeah, richie rich, you said that.
I got one! A-a private jet.
It's fueled and ready and on the tarmac or whatever.
Okay! Okay! Get it! Get it, get it, get it!
Yes, very interested. What would --
It's $25,000.
So, who pays for that?
No, we need board approval for that one.
You're the board!
Well, you call an emergency board meeting
because we have to!
Come on!
We got to do it!
Just use this, okay?
Put it on my card.
I'll sort it out with the board later. It's fine.
Thank you, Jackson.
Yeah, thanks.
Okay, amex.
3768...
It was the night that u-dub made it into the finals.
This poor freshman fell
when blocking a three-pointer.
It was such a freak injury.
The tibia was shattered in two places,
the bone was sticking out like 6 inches from the skin.
It was totally disgusting.
But I assisted the attending in the O.R.,
placing the rod and the screws.
It probably took like seven hours.
I fell in love.
It was Ortho all the way.
Yeah, look, Callie, I know you don't want to hear this, but --
Oh, come on! Nothing?
A lot of people are depressed.
I'm a happy person!
I have a number for you. This guy's great.
He helped me through a really difficult time.
My life is perfect.
I-I'm married to an amazing woman.
We're raising an adorable little girl.
I'm at the forefront of groundbreaking medical technology
with robotic limbs.
Not to mention, I'm a homeowner.
I mean, do any of these things sound depressing to you?
Maybe your stupid fancy machine's broken.
I got thrown off my surgery,
So Bailey and I decided to come visit daddy.
Hi.
I think you have a crush on my wife.
Meredith walked in,
and your pleasure center just lit up.
It's still lit.
Nope.
It's not Meredith.
I didn't see you
at the champagne toast this morning for Yang.
I had rounds.
Jealous?
Of Yang?
Don't let it eat at you.
Vascular clamp.
When Ellis won, it ate at me.
Didn't make me a better surgeon.
Made me a jealous one.
I'm not jealous!
Okay, I'm jealous.
Happy now? Therapy's over.
Not enough length on the right renal vein.
We'll need to mobilize it.
Bailey, you have your genome lab work.
The things you could do, the lives you can save --
That's award-winning.
Do they give awards to people who are stuck?
That poor boy spends the rest of his life in a bubble
if I can't figure out how to fix his mutation,
and I've been staring at the research for weeks.
Anastomosing the external iliac, 5-0 prolene.
Out of the way!
Medevac with the device just touched down on the roof.
What'd I miss?
Yang's going over the procedure in her head.
She's so cool. She's amazing.
She's totally gonna win the Harper Avery.
And we know her.
I printed one of her sample conduits.
For the rest of my life, I get to say that.
What's she doing? - Being amazing. She's poetry --
Meredith, can you turn off the intercom?
The kidney's pinking up. That's just beautiful.
What do you mean, "Enh"?
We just transplanted an HIV-positive organ,
and you're making a mopey face?
I remember when HIV baffled us --
I mean, the way it could make its way into cells,
replicate its DNA,
I mean, the perfectly designed virus.
I understand how HIV works.
We never thought we'd find anything close to a cure.
And now look at Keith.
He's alive.
He's full of T-cells.
He just received a kidney transplant -- from us.
We do this marvelous thing, I'm trying to enjoy it,
and you're bringing me down.
I understand how HIV works.
Yeah, you just said that.
Let's just close the patient.
I need to be around some sunshine, not rain clouds.
No, no. It's a perfectly designed virus.
HIV has a brilliant transport system --
The mechanisms it uses, it...
If I could deactivate it...
Okay, I need to read
everything on gene therapy and virus vectors.
I need stem cells. I-I need to get down to my lab.
Oh! I need a mocha latte!
Okay, well, go. I'll close up. Go.
Go now! Okay. Oh!
What'd I miss?
The pow.
I'm gonna start here,
uh, to leave a rim of ventricle to sew the pump to.
Good idea.
Hey, have you googled any of the other nominees?
No.
I have.
You want to know what I think?
No.
Excuse me. Sorry. Pardon me. Excuse me, sir.
No one would even know
that you're seething with jealousy right now.
I'm not seething. I am happy for her.
Right. I have a machine that will confirm seething.
I wore waterproof mascara today because I was sure
I wouldn't make it through the day without crying.
And if anybody saw me, I would say
that I was crying because I'm happy for her.
And they would believe me because...
does a jealous friend plan a champagne toast?
You planned a champagne toast to cover up your jealousy?
You're a genius.
You should call the Harper Avery people.
Tell them. Maybe they'll give me an award.
I just strapped the camera to the top,
and check this out.
You can see where you're going on your tablet,
and you can talk to anyone.
Look, I know it's not what you wanted.
It's awesome! How far does it go?
200 yards. That'll cover the whole peds floor.
You can visit your girlfriend.
She's not my girlfriend!
Um, Yang's done. Surgery was a success.
Oh. Cool.
Did you make that?
Well, it's a $10 solution.
I think it's great.
Well, money lets you do good crap in the world.
Oh, my god.
You called Butthole.
Yeah. Well, I told him I was interested.
Yang?
Congratulations on the Harper Avery.
Just a nomination.
Cristina Yang!
I taught you better than that.
When someone congratulates you,
you look them in the eye and smile and say "Thank you."
Thank you, Dr. Bailey.
You're welcome, Dr. Yang.
Kidney function is excellent. Urine output is good.
Well, that's some history-making urine.
Swap monkey, Shane.
I think I'll go back down to Dr. Bailey's genome lab.
Oh, now you want in.
She's mine.
No. You go deal with your conduits.
Ross!
Oh, Dr. Webber, I'm looking for a picture of Ellis Grey
with her first, uh, Harper Avery.
Do you remember what year it was?
1988.
Hey, you want to see?
She looks so happy.
She was happy.
That was a great night.
It was a great night.
So far, there's no evidence of clotting,
and his pump is working well.
He's doing really great.
We're gonna keep him sedated for about 24 hours
and then slowly wake him up.
Thank you all so much.
I'm -- I'm sorry that we doubted you.
We shouldn't have.
Doubt is normal.
Get some rest.
I have clean underwear?
I'm gonna cry. You're making me cry.
Don't be surprised when you see a charge
for, like, $25,000 on the credit card.
What?
Yeah, you know how earlier I said
I don't spend my money on hookers and private planes?
I guess, like, technically, I was lying.
You spent $25,000 on --
On an airplane, okay?
For Cristina's experimental heart to get here.
And the board is gonna reimburse me.
Who even has a credit limit that high?
Turns out I do.
I-I feel a little sick.
Your credit limit
and trust fund and $4 lattes
are -- are literally just making me feel sick.
Eat some three-day-old lasagna.
That'll make you feel better.
I didn't know that you were waiting.
You're gonna kill me.
Why?
You are.
Oh, my god. I can't believe I'm even...
Did you sleep with someone else?
What? No!
Oh. Thank god. You scared me.
I want another baby.
What?
Look, I want my life back, too,
and I want time to have a thought and do my work.
But I also --
Wait -- why on earth would you think
I would sleep with someone else?
Because you said that I was gonna kill you.
After everything that we've been through,
how you could ever, even for one second,
think that I would sleep with someone else is crazy.
I want another baby, too.
What?
I don't want Sofia to bury us alone
or nurse us through some horrible, long decline by herself.
She should go through that with someone else.
That's morbid and awful.
Or practical.
And awful.
Well, you want another baby, too.
Yeah, because I love babies.
They're adorable and delicious.
And you just realized that this afternoon?
Yeah, I forgot. And then I saw Meredith and her baby, and --
Wait. Why are we arguing?
We're gonna have another baby.
We are.
I love you so much.
I love you so, so much.
Oh! We're gonna have another baby!
My mom didn't think she'd win.
She thought it was a popularity contest,
and she wasn't popular.
She was a woman and a fellow,
and her arrogance could rub people the wrong way.
She hadn't allowed herself to imagine
the possibility of winning
because she wanted it too much.
You know, I have looked at the other nominees.
I've seen their research.
Me too.
What? Really?
Yes, I looked at everyone's abstracts
and read their articles.
I even called a friend over at, uh, Chicago Children's
who knows Lucas -- you know, whatever his name is --
who's doing the work on the ligature tissue-sealing device,
which is...kinda...
Derivative.
Right? Right?
And supposedly, his trial patients are not doing well.
Which is bad, obviously, but also --
I think you're gonna win.
And when they called my mom's name,
she was genuinely shocked.
It was validation of all her hard work and sacrifice.
I really do.
I think you are going to win.
Me too.
She came home and told me
she didn't win the Harper Avery.
