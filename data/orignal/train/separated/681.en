Daniel is on a digging mission
about my father investing in Nolcorp.
I'm your C.F.O.,
and you can't tell me
where nearly half a billion dollars went.
it all went to the daughter of our first investor.
David Clarke.
I want no ties with you.
Meet my brother Nate. That's my partner in the bar.
They're good guys.
Well, the same can't be said about their old man.
I'm glad you came to your senses, Porter.
Matt, what the hell are you doing? Give me the gun.
It belongs to you, anyway.
Ryan had it coming to him. You know that!
Emily and I have a plan to infiltrate grayson global,
to draw out the initiative.
If you'll consider me as a replacement to my father,
we will triple our net worth inside a year.
The choice is yours.
You have to help me protect our son.
We have to block him from taking control of the board,
no matter what it takes.
For the righteous,
a revelation is a joyous event,
the realization of a divine truth.
But for the wicked,
revelations can be far more terrifying,
When dark secrets are exposed
And sinners are punished for their trespasses.
Pull!
Pull!
Pull!
Pull!
Excelente, Victoria.
Well, after my kidnapping,
I developed a fondness for firearms.
You better not cross this one, Conrad.
You have no idea.
Pull!
You are out of practice.
Yeah, well, leisure time has been in short supply of late.
But once I'm clear of
this absurd no-confidence vote Daniel's launched against me,
rest assured, my marksmanship will return.
Daniel's talk of delivering Nolcorp is a persuasive argument.
Oh, please. Come on.
Even if Daniel's correct
and Nolcorp is Grayson property,
Nolan Ross and his people
are gonna drag this through the courts for years.
Trust me, this is not the game changer my son believes it to be.
Still, some are listening.
Well, some isn't enough.
They need a two-thirds majority to oust Conrad.
Which, assuming your influence
over the core members of the board remains absolute,
should prove pretty much impossible.
My block will vote with me,
whichever way I choose to go.
Do me the honor?
With pleasure, Salvador. Pull!
Salvador Grobet--
Brazil's answer to Richard Branson.
Only rather than building his fortune business by business,
he married into it.
He and conrad Certainly appear cozy.
Grobet has voted Conrad's interest in every major decision
since his appointment to the board in '99.
Unless we change that,
you lose your shot at a seat next to Daniel.
And with it, our inroad to the initiative.
You think we can flip his vote?
I think Grobet is a greedy bastard like the rest of them.
If Daniel delivers Nolcorp,
Grobet will deliver the board.
Sacrificial lamb reporting for the slaughter.
I wasn't expecting an actual firing squad.
Look, I'll leave you two to, uh, do your thing.
Well, now that I'm in the belly of the beast,
care to explain?
I need Salvador Grobet to see
that Daniel's acquisition of Nolcorp isn't just a pipe dream.
Your being here makes it credible.
Oh, it's more than credible. It's inevitable.
I'm sorry about your company, Nolan.
I know how much it means to you.
The truth is, Ems,
I've been waiting for this shoe to drop for a while now.
But I've got a plan that should help mitigate the sting.
And what's that?
Well, that's for me to know, and you to find out.
Oh, how's that feel? Not so fun, huh?
Just be careful.
Nobody plays dirtier than the Graysons.
All right.
Great, Mr. Donovan. Okay. We'll see you tomorrow.
Bye.
That's dad's address book.
Yeah, I'm inviting, uh,
some of his old crew to the christening.
A lot of these guys really stepped up when he died,
told me not to be a stranger.
That's nice.
Actually, it was Kenny's idea.
Well, mine and Nate's father died suddenly, too.
You know, we miss him every day.
At least little Carl's godfather will be there in the flesh.
Oh, is that me?
I thought you were waiting for Bull to say yes.
Don't be a dipstick.
Dipstick?
Whoa. I can come back if you two need a minute.
Actually, I'm glad you guys are both here.
You really saved our hides with this place,
And I was hoping you'd come to my son's christening tomorrow.
Yeah, we'd be honored to.
Looking forward to meeting some of your dad's old pals,
get a sense of the history of this place.
Right, Nate?
Absolutely.
In fact, open bar for all your guests after the ceremony,
On us.
Mr. Grobet,
Good to see you.
Please, Daniel,
You are certainly man enough now to call me Salvador.
And who is this lovely belleza?
Ashley Davenport. Nice to meet you.
Nice meeting you.
This is Aiden Mathis,
Satoshi Takeda's liaison to our company.
He's been spearheading the Nolcorp acquisition with me.
Despite what Conrad says,
I assume negotiations are going well.
I spotted you speaking with Mr. Ross earlier.
Yes, I, uh, invited him last minute.
A little glad-handing never hurt a negotiation.
Mr. Takeda taught you well.
Where's your wife today, Salvador?
Sadly, Magda couldn't make the trip.
I'm afraid I'm left to entertain myself.
Well, I will be happy to organize activities
to fill your time.
Oh, I'd love that, Ms. Davenport.
Would you like to take a turn, Daniel?
Why not?
Pull!
Emily.
Sorry. Bad etiquette.
But an impressive shot.
I should come to the Hamptons more often.
Beautiful women seem to fall from the skies.
Oh, you're too kind.
Salvador Grobet, Emily Thorne.
Ms. Thorne is considering
a sizable investment in Grayson Global.
And what is your hesitation?
I'm a cautious person.
And after Conrad Grayson's assorted public embarrassments,
I'd rather see someone a little less...
Burdened at the helm before I open my checkbook,
namely Daniel.
Beautiful and pragmatic...
A splendid combination.
Would you care for a cold drink, Mr. Grobet?
Take the lead, please.
Nice shot.
Your aim has improved.
Well, I taught her a thing or two.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
Mr. Grobet's approval is key
to securing my leadership at the company.
I'm happy to help.
Have a nice day.
There's a nice touch...
Trotting Ashley out,
considering Salvador's penchant for exotic women.
I would think he'd have better self-preservation instincts,
seeing as his wife holds his fortune.
Conrad.
We need to discuss your son's future.
No, we don't. Daniel's of no concern to you.
Oh, on the contrary.
As the changing of the guard
at Grayson Global appears imminent,
your usefulness to us seems to have run its course.
All right, you listen to me.
I have no intention of relinquishing control of my company.
You deal with me and only me.
You leave my son out of this.
In the unlikely event the vote swings your way,
we're willing to reconsider,
but be warned.
If you attempt to alert Daniel in any way
to our resurgent relationship,
your son will be removed from the equation permanently.
Hello, Victoria.
I swear, you so much as lay a hand on my son,
and I will kill you myself!
Understand?!
Hello?
Prepare to enter the lion's den.
Oh, and here comes little simba now.
Nolan, Ms. Lahari, thanks for agreeing to the meeting.
Let's not make this any more unpleasant
than it needs to be.
Oh, unpleasant? Pshaw.
Isn't it every man's dream to give over
49% of his company to a hostile conglomerate?
Actually, new details have emerged
that alter those terms.
Are we all set?
Everything's in order.
I'm sorry. Um... Ash.
Where's Aiden Mathis?
He's the one I've been dealing with.
Aiden doesn't work for the company,
not in any official capacity.
As a courtesy to you,
I thought you might want to discuss this in private.
I trust no introduction is necessary.
What's going on?
Who is he?
Would you mind stepping outside?
What are you doing here, Marco?
I invited him.
As Nolcorp's former C.F.O.,
I thought Mr. Romero might help shed some light
on your company's solvency.
What he shared with me, however,
was a far more interesting story
about a missing $500-million bank account.
What did you tell him?
Marco here claims he set up an offshore account for you
as a tax shelter back in 2002--
An account that was mysteriously drained
a week before Nolcorp went public.
Did he tell you who the money was for?
No, all he told me was that
you had sole control over the account.
Fine...
Danny.
You want the money? I'll write you a check.
Oh, it's not that easy.
I mean, we're talking interest, penalties,
and a potential criminal investigation.
But I am willing to forgot all that
if we can come to a swift agreement.
51% controlling interest in Nolcorp
and your continued good faith service as its C.E.O.
And visionary.
And...
If I refuse?
Then I'll dispatch an army of forensic accountants
to hunt down every missing penny of that $500 million.
And something tells me,
you don't want me finding out where it ended up.
Well-played, boss.
Guess it looks like I work for Grayson Global now.
See you around, Marco.
Success suits you.
I don't remember you ever looking more dashing.
Wall street's new golden boy.
It's not like I did it alone.
Now that Nolcorp is secure,
I can bring Aiden back in.
Mr. Grobet seemed to take a shine to him.
He should be the one to deliver the good news.
No, it should be you.
You're the one that found Nolan's former C.F.O.
And you obviously didn't trust Aiden enough
to include him in the final negotiations.
Listen, if Aiden's gonna be my man on the board,
I want him building a rapport with its most powerful member.
Besides, without him,
I never would've connected the dots to Nolcorp.
And he would be the first to tell you.
Daniel...
I can't sit back and watch you get played
by another Grayson wannabe.
Not after what happened with Tyler.
Remember him?
I've spent the past year trying to forget him. Mm.
I'm only suggesting that you take things slow with him,
make sure he's been properly vetted
before he gets in any deeper.
白天深藏她的背叛行为 晚上在睡梦中供认罪行
Hello, Lady Macbeth.
Ah, right on cue.
Evening, Daniel.
Is this a bad time?
No, just going over some details for your pitch to the board.
Uh, what's up?
Listen, give yourself the night off.
I'll take lead on prep for the vote.
When should we convene?
I'll get back to you on that.
But thanks for all your support.
My pleasure.
Ashley's turning Daniel against you.
That's the problem. What's the solution?
We turn Daniel against Ashley.
Okay, Ems.
I can't say you didn't warn me about that tricky little bastard.
God, Danny boy really learned how to play dirty.
It's in his D.N.A.
Is the video encrypted yet?
Uploading now.
And...
Adios, Ash.
Which should put your pale british shadow
back in Danny's good graces.
Top of the morning, Mathis.
Ross. Look, what happened yesterday was beyond regrettable.
So, uh, we all got played. My apologies.
Yeah, well, just get your board seat back
so I can pull the rip cord on my golden parachute.
FYI, file's uploading now.
If she doesn't open it in five minutes...
it opens itself.
Off to the chapel.
Coming, Ems?
So...
In the midst of a maelstrom,
you still have time for a christening.
Who is this Porter fellow to you anyway?
An old friend.
Old friend, that all he is?
Could've been something more.
At... one point almost was.
But it wasn't meant to be.
Another casualty of what we do.
Hey, you don't have to keep secrets from me.
I'm not.
It's okay if you want to, but...
you don't have to.
I know.
Old habits.
Look, I'll be, uh, right here when you get back.
Mr. Grobet, what a lovely surprise.
And for me as well.
I assume that you spoke with Daniel.
I did, and I'm very impressed.
Good. I'm pleased.
Mr. Grobet, I thought I heard your voice.
You must be looking for Conrad.
Yes. I'm sorry that I dropped in unannounced.
Is he home?
He is. He's in his study. He'll be thrilled to see you.
We're still on track, I presume.
I should speak to your husband.
Ms. Davenport.
Always a pleasure, Mr. Grobet.
Heavenly father,
surround this child with your love,
and protect him from evil.
Who are the godparents?
Declan Foster Porter.
Emily Rebecca Thorne.
Do you renounce Satan and all his empty promises?
Do you vow to protect this child,
to stave off sin, and shield him from evil?
Promise.
Promise.
Please.
I baptize thee, Carl,
in the name of the father, and of the son, and of the holy ghost.
Dearest father in heaven, bless this child...
smile upon this child and surround this child, lord,
with the soft mantle of your love...
Matt Duncan?
Hey. What a surprise, man.
Great to see you.
I thought you moved your family down to Florida.
I-I hope you don't mind me crashing.
Aw, are you kidding? It's great to see you.
It's been way too long.
Yeah.
What are the Ryan brothers doing here?
Oh, Kenny Ryan bought in to the bar.
You know those guys?
Yeah, and listen to me,
get yourself out of that deal.
What are you talking about?
I woulda lost the bar if it weren't for their help.
They don't help anybody.
And they sure as hell didn't come to your bar by accident.
Trust me, Jack.
Get 'em out.
See you around, kid. Congrats.
Listen, I don't deny
that you have helped make me a very wealthy man.
Using your wife's money to do it.
Tell me, what--what can you possibly not afford
that these newfound millions might bring you?
Good question, Conrad.
Perhaps I'll leave it to you to find an answer.
Oh, well, then, you're still persuadable?
Not by anything you possess.
Well?
He's going with Daniel.
Don't pretend for one second
that you give a damn about that boy.
A clue, perhaps, as to what the hell you're talking about?
See for yourself.
You have wormed your way
into the very nadir of repugnance.
Where did you get this?
From whoever seems to be circling this family
with an endless catalog of our sins.
Sex with your son's girlfriend? Really, Conrad.
You and I were divorced at the time--
Oh, so you say.
It could've happened this morning for all I know.
Oh, what are you suggesting,
that fidelity is one of your strong points?
And as for Daniel, he had yet to commence...
his misguided relationship with dear Ms. Davenport.
A relationship you allowed to proceed
without mentioning your own pathetic lack of impulse control.
We can discuss how that theoretical father-son chat
would have unfolded at a later date.
Right now, we have more pressing problems.
Our upwardly mobile son
not only closed the Nolcorp deal,
He managed to wrest a controlling interest
in that company,
seemingly without impediment,
which brings us to this little video
that was so conveniently dispatched to you
right in the midst of our current crisis.
Now what is the one entity with the only real ability to make
and the motive to use this recording?
The initiative.
They know that as long as you and I remain united,
we just might have the strength to ensure
Daniel doesn't win that vote tomorrow.
Victoria, they are trying to drive a wedge between us
because they sense a change in the headwinds.
They're going all in on Daniel, aren't they?
Yeah, so if you must,
you may unload your usual rain of hellfire on me
once this ordeal is over, but until we prevail,
I would advise you to focus your considerable powers
on rescuing our son.
My parents aren't exactly
the best role models in the world,
which shouldn't surprise anyone who reads the internet,
watches tv, is alive.
On the plus side, it makes it really easy for me
to spot good parents.
And that's exactly why my nephew
is the luckiest little guy in the world.
I need to go.
Emily, wait up.
You're just taking off without telling anyone.
You were surrounded by family. I didn't want to break it up.
You're my family, too.
I saw you at church...
How you looked at Jack and me.
You're wrong.
You deserve something like what we have.
Maybe.
But it's not my time. Not yet.
Why, 'cause your off on another mission
to destroying someone else's life?
I'm not destroying lives, Amanda.
I'm righting wrongs.
Tell yourself whatever you have to,
but when will enough be enough?
Look, just say good-bye to Jack for me.
Envisioning your future?
I didn't know that you were there.
Undoubtedly. Mm.
I used to do the very same thing.
Plan out my path,
identify the obstacles,
visualize the next six months,
one year, five years...
and as a result,
All those thoughts became this.
You've made yourself quite at home at Grayson Manor
as of late.
I do my best to keep out of your way.
That's debatable.
Still, I was hoping that you could assist me
with a matter that's come to my attention.
Yes.
I had that reaction, too.
Please, you must understand...
Which part, that you seduced my husband,
or that you hid it from my all-too-trusting son?
It happened one time. You had just fired me.
It was a terrible mistake.
On that, we are in violent agreement.
He offered to help me-- money, a-a job.
Put yourself in the same position.
Can you honestly say that you wouldn't have done
the exact same thing?
Oh, well, my judgment's not in question here,
nor my future.
And we both know it would be
a simple pleasure to annihilate you.
Please, Victoria.
Don't destroy what I have with Daniel.
I love him.
I swear, I will do anything to put this right.
I'm counting on it.
Now...
you know where Mr. Grobet is staying, don't you?
Yes.
Call him.
Slight hiccup in the plan,
and by "Slight," I mean massive.
Victoria's gonna exploit Ashley's plight
to her advantage.
What? How?
By sending her to Salvador's bed.
And if Ashley manages to convince him...
to change his mind about Daniel...
Conrad wins the vote.
and we lose our biggest link to the Initiative.
No.
That's not an option.
Wow. Where are you off to?
I forgot that I have to butter up some donors
for the heal the sound benefit.
But I won't be long.
Good. I'm liable to get jealous
with you out dressed like this.
Something wrong?
Daniel, no one's ever been kinder to me than you.
I just want you to know how much that means to me.
Well, that's nice. You're welcome, babe.
Now hurry up so you can get back here.
Is she on her way?
She just left. You're good to go.
Aiden, what's up?
How soon can you get to the Cooper's Neck Inn?
20 minutes. Is there a problem?
Not on the phone.
I'm on my way.
Thanks for coming, Nolan.
I know you're a busy guy.
Not for much longer.
Look, you're, uh...
You're good at finding out stuff about people, right?
I think I might have a little problem on my hands
with the guy who bought in to the bar and his brother.
Text me their names, and I'll...
Nolan.
Um, Jack, could we...
Could we pick this up later?
Thanks.
Marco.
What, did you come to collect the knife
you left in my back?
Oh, it's not your usual hangout last I remember.
Oh, well, a lot of things have changed
since you walked out the door.
Please. You mean since you threw me out.
So is this--is this really where Amanda Clarke lives?
She never saw a penny of that fortune
you allegedly put aside for her, did she?
You obviously think you have a trump card, Marco.
Why don't you go ahead and play it?
Okay.
Getting fired from Nolcorp before the I.P.O.
basically trashed my career.
I am tired of living hand to mouth.
Well, I offered you a payout,
which you threw back in my face, literally.
I didn't want a payout, Nolan.
I want my old job back.
I helped to build Nolcorp from the ground up,
and you know that.
And you just helped tear it down,
So no dice.
Plus...
The position's already been filled.
Padma is so much better for me than you ever were.
Why, because she's easier to fool?
Padma knows exactly who I am.
I've told her everything.
Except for the fact that you're allowing Amanda Clarke
and your best friend to live above a bar,
cueless about the money that's rightfully hers.
Ms. Davenport...
I understand you have a proposition for me.
May I come in?
Please do.
You'll find a glass of champagne waiting for you
on the nightstand.
All right. What's going on?
I want to know why you left me out
of the final negotiations with Nolcorp.
I thought we were partners.
We were working together.
Partners is taking it a bit far.
Without my efforts, the Nolcorp acquisition
would never have gotten off the launchpad.
Why are you suddenly questioning my loyalty?
The truth?
Bcause I've only known you for a few weeks,
and I've been advised to have you further vetted.
Advised by whom?
What, your girlfriend?
Because if she's the bar by which you measure fidelity,
then there's something you need to know.
Daniel.
Ashley.
Hey, you shouldn't be here.
Ashley.
Daniel?
No, it's--Daniel, this isn't what you think it is.
Then what is it exactly, huh?
Oh, let me guess. My father sent you here
to screw Grobet for his vote, didn't he?
No, no, no.
Is that what happened?
No, no! No, that's not--
You've been working for him this whole time,haven't you?
No, no, I haven't.
No, Daniel, please listen to me.
Daniel, listen.
No-- save it. Get off of me!
Hey, that's enough!
You disgust me!
Hey, please.
You listen to me, you son of a bitch.
Unless you want me to hand your wife the easiest,
and for you, the costliest divorce in history,
your vote is mine tomorrow.
Get your stuff out of my house, Ashley.
Congratulations, Miss Thorne.
I do believe, this time tomorrow,
Grayson global will be coronating a new king.
Oh, hey, Francine.
Excuse me.
Salvador,
I trust last night left Conrad in good standing with you.
Unfortunately for your husband,
it seems Daniel inherited twice your ruthlessness.
I'll side with the boy,
and those loyal to me will follow.
He's won, hasn't he?
Yes.
But we have one card left to play.
What, tell him the truth?
It'd be like signing his death warrant.
Daniel, before you go in there,
please give us five minutes.
You've got two.
I've known you two
to be capable of some pretty vile things,
But you've outdone yourselves this time.
Now what the hell are you holding over Ashley
that would compel her to degrade herself like this?
Whatever Ashley did or didn't do is irrelevant.
The truth is...
The truth?
Coming from you?
Victoria.
The truth is,
that I will do whatever it takes to protect you.
I recognize that you're ambitious, but you are young.
And as your mother,
as the one person who loves you more than anyone in this world,
I beseech you to call off this vote--
And why would I do that?
Winning that vote today will put you in unspeakable danger.
Fine.
Tell me what kind of danger I'm in.
Come on. Make me believe you.
I can't.
As expected.
The depths you'll go to stay in power are shameless.
Mr. Duncan.
Hey, Declan.
We, uh, we missed you at the reception.
Yeah, it was a beautiful ceremony, though.
Your dad would've been proud.
Is, uh, Jack around?
I thought I remembered he lived on the boat.
Yeah. Well, no.
N--I live here now, ever since the baby came.
Did you check the bar? He's probably just opening up.
Oh, yeah. Right. I'll do that.
It's just--it, um...
Are his business partners around?
Nate and Kenny?
Yeah.
Should be here any minute.
Want me to walk up with you?
Know what?
I left the baby's gift in the backseat.
I-I gotta go get it. I'll be right back.
Okay.
Well, well. Hey, Kenny. Look who it is.
You remember Matt Duncan.
Sure do.
Been a long time.
I don't have anything to say to you boys.
Well, that's too bad.
We got a lot of questions for you,
mainly about what happened to our old man six years ago.
I don't know anything about it.
See, we don't believe that's true.
You know why?
'Cause the last thing he says to us was,
he had a meeting right here with your old pal Carl Porter.
Same night your kid was sideswiped by a car.
After that, we never heard from him again.
I spent that night in the hospital.
That's not the whole story, is it?
Tell you what. Why don't we go settle this like men?
See if I can't find a way to jog your memory.
Thank you so much.
It's over.
Salvador voted with Daniel,
and the board did the same.
So it's official.
He's the new C.E.O..
Mr. Grobet,
thank you for your vote.
I suggest you smile and shake my hand.
In addition to Nolcorp,
my other acquisition today was your loyalty.
Don't forget that.
All right.
Emily, what a nice surprise.
Daniel, I hear congratulations are in order.
Oh, thank you.
I think I may have found my calling.
What brings you to the city?
Actually, I was just hoping to steal Aiden for a bit.
Well, he's your man.
I just need him for two seconds.
Absolutely.
Victoria, Conrad.
I bet you're so proud.
I know I am.
Congratulations I knew you could do it.
Aiden, I couldn't have done it without you.
Thank you.
Which makes this bit of bad news
all the more difficult to deliver.
My leadership was not the only piece of new business
that came to pass today.
The board also elected to close ranks
while the company goes through this transition.
Meaning?
Meaning there's no room for you on the board
unless someone willingly vacates,
and I don't see that happening anytime soon,
as the Nolcorp deal
just increased our bottom line by 30%.
But, hey, look on the bright side.
I'm sure this will come
as a considerable relief to Mr. Takeda,
who's just regained your full attention.
Have fun with Emily today.
Yeah.
He's finally down.
What you lookin' for?
My dad's address book
so I can send out thank-yous for all the christening gifts.
Have you seen it?
No. Did you ask Declan?
No. Hey, man.
Jack.
Look, I am sorry to be the bearer of troubling news,
but I did that research
you asked for on your new business partners.
Does the name Joe Ryan mean anything to you?
Wait. Wait a minute.
Are--are you saying they're related to that Joe Ryan?
I am telling you, he's their father.
I dug up an article from November of '06.
His body washed up on gin beach. He'd been--
Shot to death. I know.
They never found the person who did it.
Yeah, well,
looks like your new buddy Nate took a page from dad's playbook.
He just wrapped up a 5-year vacay at rikers for drug trafficking.
And as for Kenny, the guy doesn't own a house in Southampton.
He sublets a 1-bedroom in Sag Harbor.
Jack, these guys are seriously bad dudes.
There's a man out there covered in blood. I think he's dying.
I-I gotta call you back.
Jack--
Stay with the baby!
No, Jack--
Keep your eyes open. Come on. Stay awake.
Stay up. Come on.
Mr. Duncan!
What happened?
I don't know. I found him like this.
Is he dead?
No.
Keep him conscious. I'm calling 9-1-1.
No.
No cops.
Get her outta here.
Charlotte, come on.
The--the Ryans...
They did this to you?
Their old man, they... think your dad killed him.
That's crazy.
My dad would never do something like that.
He didn't. I did.
I used his gun.
He hid it on your boat to protect me.
They're not your friends, Jack.
They want payback.
Needless to say,
You were right to keep Daniel in the dark this afternoon.
The boy will soon run the company toward the ground,
proving little use to the Initiative.
On the contrary.
I think he handled himself very well today.
Seemingly.
But his vaulting ambition
will bring him down as swiftly as it propped him up.
What the hell was that for?
Take your pick.
Evening, Jack.
Thought we should check on you guys.
Heard there was a little incident earlier.
Yeah.
Decided to close up early. People were pretty spooked.
Yeah. Looks like it.
Is it true some old-timer nearly bought it out there?
Some friend of your father's or something?
Matt Duncan.
Luckily I got him to the hospital in time.
Yeah, lucky for him. You're a good samaritan, Jack.
Most people wouldn't get involved.
Did he say who did it?
No. Never saw 'em. He got jumped from behind.
Guess we should all keep our eyes open then.
Yeah, speaking of which,
I accidentally picked up your pop's black book off the bar today.
he--
He's a real popular guy, your old man, huh?
That was a nice christening today.
Sleep tight.
Jack...
What's going on?
Nothing.
Go back to bed.
Lock the doors. I'll be up in a minute.
Last one.
Good.
My hand is cramping.
So it's done.
We're an official subsidiary of Grayson Global.
Yeah, well, forgive me if I don't feel like
cracking open the champagne. Mm.
Nolan, I'm sorry.
I feel responsible.
Don't.
Remember when I asked you how far you'd be willing to go
to defend this company?
First rule of dirty dealing, always have a contingency plan
that bites your opponent in the ass
Harder than they bit you.
What kind of plan?
Just know that I have no intention
of letting those bastards profit off David Clarke.
But why wait? Why not hit them now?
It's much easier to destroy a castle from inside its walls.
Huh. Suddenly I've become--
A Trojan horse.
Oh, when I'm finished,
young Daniel won't know what hit him.
Always burning the midnight oil.
Should I call security?
That's a good question, Nolan.
Um, Padma...
Marco and I are... in talks
to find him a position within the company.
What?
After what he did?
That's insane.
Actually, it's just smart business.
Right, Nolan?
Do you think it's possible for people like us to ever be--
Like everybody else?
I was gonna say "Happy."
Maybe not completely.
But right now I'm happy.
Being with you is the only time I've ever felt peace.
Revelations can help us accept the things we need the most...
expose the secrets we so desperately try to hide...
and illuminate the dangers all around us.
But more than anything,
Revelations are windows into our true selves...
both the good...
and the evil...
and those weavering somewhere in between
Everything is in place.
With the ultimate power to destroy all that we cherish most.
Shall we put the plan to a vote?
维多利亚·格雷森
Victoria.
I'd like to speak to you about a matter of grave importance.
It's about Daniel.
Oh, I see you have company.
Why don't you call me when you're alone?
Well, that was unexpected.
Who was that?
Leverage.
