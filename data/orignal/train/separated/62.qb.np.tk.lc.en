hey , you shoot when i say you can sh ...
what is your name ?
ricky packer .
29 days .
ah , c @-@ could you include the question
in the answer , you know ?
yeah , yeah .
uh , my name is ricky packer .
and i have 29 days left to live .
been reading a lot of the bible-- job .
&quot; when i lie down , i think ,
how long before i get up ? &quot;
yes , camus says ,
&quot; fate is not in man , but around him . &quot;
what is your crime , please ?
well , the state says double homicide ,
but i don &apos;t even think they believe that .
they had some bodies they needed to put on someone .
you were saying before i switched on the camera
about the authorities .
what is it you were saying ?
oh , yeah , yeah .
i told the guards about this murder that i heard about--
almighty vice lords payback on 19th .
there &apos;s a dead body buried up there in douglas park .
you think they care ?
no . why don &apos;t they care ?
it means more work .
they go dig up some gangbanger &apos;s body , what are they gonna do ?
they gonna go find the killer ?
you got here fast .
yeah , it &apos;s called driving .
what &apos;d you do , stop for hamburgers ?
so , what is it , gang @-@ related ?
yep . his tip was accurate .
a tip from death row-- go figure .
john doe buried six months .
one other thing , mr. deputy state &apos;s attorney .
yeah ?
you missed a button .
thank you , asa lodge .
do we know his colors ?
22nd disciple .
an almighty vice lords reprisal ?
well , that &apos;s the thinking .
but oddly enough , that &apos;s not why you &apos;re here .
they dug up someone else .
a citizen ?
with very expensive taste .
ed says those are christian louboutin shoes .
ed knows that ?
the purse still had $ 300 cash in it .
name on the driver &apos;s license was adrianne iver .
a missing person for six months now .
and guess what else we found in her purse .
her boyfriend &apos;s number .
how long ?
they &apos;ll be here in 20 minutes .
so what do i do ?
just what they ask .
you will be processed , photographed and fingerprinted .
they will take away all your clothes
and supply you with a department of corrections jumpsuit .
our hope is you &apos;ll get bail .
you have ties to the community ,
and the evidence is circumstantial .
i loved her .
i mean , we argued , but i loved her .
i @-@ i didn &apos;t report her missing
because adrianne said she was going back to canada .
alicia .
it &apos;s important .
okay , the key thing here is to let us do our job .
what &apos;s that about ?
he &apos;s being charged with murdering his girlfriend .
what &apos;s important ?
my computer &apos;s acting up again .
yeah , i know that doesn &apos;t quite sound as important .
really ?
i need you in this meeting , too .
okay , i have a meeting . you got to go .
you should &apos;ve told mom no .
i did tell her no .
that &apos;s not what she said .
she said you vetted her
and everything was all right for her to run .
why is it that every other kid in the universe
knows about computers except you ?
your mom &apos;s a politician now .
she &apos;s adapting the truth for her needs .
you know who gets hurt in all this ?
the children .
they &apos;ll talk about your divorce
and how i &apos;m the product of a broken home .
and how i &apos;m dating a communist .
bob &apos;s a communist ?
ben .
and i broke up with him .
this is a new one . hal .
do you date anyone with more than one syllable ?
it makes our conversations very confusing .
didn &apos;t i say i had a meeting ?
tell mom not to run .
you tell her .
she &apos;ll listen to you . i &apos;m not the one ...
hey , old man , how you doing ?
so , i got to head off to meet the candidate .
where are we ?
a hiccup .
actually , more than a hiccup .
you said he was clean , eli .
i want to run him for lower office
and gear up for the 2016 presidential .
he was .
financials are healthy ,
no affairs , good to his kids .
wow , you &apos;re bringing in saint alicia .
this must be serious .
more than serious .
we &apos;re dealing with the ridicule factor .
is that a picture ?
that &apos;s something else .
well , giuliani dressed up in women &apos;s clothes .
he survived that .
this is different .
okay , all right .
what do you need ?
bring him in . we &apos;ll talk about how to handle it .
will she be here ?
alicia . and yes , i will be in the meeting .
he &apos;s got kids .
he &apos;s gonna want to know how this &apos;ll impact his kids .
understandable .
you think we can survive it ?
i think if we &apos;re lucky .
so what &apos;s going on here ?
heard you were under investigation .
you heard we &apos;re under investigation ?
i heard the firm &apos;s under investigation .
look , i don &apos;t want to drag my candidate in here
and have this firm be under indictment .
no , uh , w @-@ we &apos;re good .
we &apos;re growing and , uh ,
we &apos;re @-@ we &apos;re blooming .
aren &apos;t we good ?
yes . better than ever .
a rumor is often a sign of jealous competitors .
hello .
hi .
we haven &apos;t met .
asa dana lodge .
kalinda sharma .
i was just trying to ...
sneak the adrianne iver crime scene photos ?
want to see ?
sure .
adrianne iver ,
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old flight attendant ,
quit her job after her boyfriend proposed .
oh , wait .
you represent her boyfriend , don &apos;t you ?
tom lavere ?
why , yes , we do .
ah , what a coincidence .
they fought , adrianne tried to leave .
that didn &apos;t end well .
tom shot her with his walther p99 handgun .
which was never recovered .
yes , so few criminals make it easy for us these days .
mr. lavere buried the body
in a dirt lot near douglas park six months ago ,
far from prying eyes .
and as luck would have it , this very same lot was chosen by
an almighty vice lord to bury a 22nd disciple .
so when we dug up one , we dug up the other .
so you and cary ?
me and cary ?
you and cary .
i don &apos;t think there is a me and cary .
my mistake .
now , uh , mr. lavere , our client ,
he was worried about ms. iver &apos;s safety .
they were burglarized the week prior ,
so he gave her his handgun for protection .
and it was the same handgun
that she kept in her glove compartment .
really ?
yeah .
so here &apos;s just another possible scenario .
ms. iver was driving when she came across a gangland slaying .
oh , happens all the time .
she reached into the glove compartment for the walther p99
when she was stopped by your almighty vice lord ,
who took the gun ...
and shot her with her own gun ?
yeah .
so , in your scenario , what happened to her car ?
gone .
taken by the killers to a chop shop .
these are two connected murders .
you solve this , you &apos;ll know who killed adrianne iver .
only problem :
we solved this murder .
a gang sweep .
maurice johnson , aka aka .
yeah , it makes things hard when their akas are &quot; aka . &quot;
what did he do , confess ?
we ask that mr. johnson be tried as an adult , your honor .
your honor , maurice has come forward on his own .
he has confessed to this homicide exactly because
he wants to remake his life .
you don &apos;t believe him ?
i tend not to believe
14 @-@ year @-@ old lieutenants who confess .
but maybe that &apos;s just me .
well , you bring me proof of the opposite , i &apos;m all ears .
but we closed two murders .
aka killed the 22nd disciple banger .
tom lavere killed his girlfriend .
where do i bring the proof ?
where ?
yeah . do you have a card ?
yeah . sure , kalinda .
here . and this is my cell .
so , anytime .
thanks .
we have a problem .
they think they &apos;ve resolved it .
got it .
we &apos;re with the filmmaker now .
so , how did the police get involved ?
you see , i sent the footage to the police .
i did not think they would pursue it .
they dug up two bodies .
yes , i know . it is now part of my documentary .
quite exciting .
do you plan to interview ricky packer again ?
unfortunately , they have now limited access to death row .
did he say anything more about this murder , andre ?
anything more in your footage ?
he did . i @-@ i showed it to the police ,
but , uh , they are uninterested now .
uh , can we see it ?
of course .
well , i interviewed mr. packer again ,
after they found the body .
it is always good to go with my assistant .
he likes the pretty women .
you say you know who killed him ?
who killed this man ?
yeah .
but why am i gonna help the cops ?
why would you not ?
look , man , the cops don &apos;t care if they got the wrong one .
vice lords are gonna do what they always do :
send up some wannabe gangster to go do a juvie rap .
cops will be happy .
and that was the end .
no more interviews .
he didn &apos;t say who did it ?
great .
the only one who can help our client
is being executed in 36 hours .
i can &apos;t do this .
i can &apos;t go back to jail .
it was just the bail hearing .
tom , listen to me . we have a lot of options .
i can &apos;t last till trial .
i can &apos;t wait six months .
let &apos;s go .
listen to me .
we are not delaying this to trial .
we &apos;re doing everything we can , okay ?
time &apos;s up .
is that all you have , mr. coyne ?
that is only part of what we have , y @-@ your honors .
mr. packer will be executed in approximately 30 hours ,
and we ask that you look carefully at the legal mistakes
made by the trial judge .
&quot; look again at the legal mistakes &quot; ?
yes .
if it pleases the court .
we &apos;ll take that under advisement .
you here to help ?
well , it &apos;s a bit more complicated than that .
try me .
we need to get to ricky packer before he &apos;s executed .
we think he can help us on a case .
you &apos;re kidding .
no , i &apos;m afraid not .
can you get us in to him ?
we can &apos;t even get in to him .
unless the judges hear our appeal ,
he &apos;s in 24 @-@ hour lockdown .
you have another appeal coming up ?
lack of mitigation at trial , yeah .
why ?
so , we have the humanitarian appeal
and not much time .
alicia , you &apos;ve dealt with judge glendon before .
yes . he has the swing vote on the court .
he sided with us on another death row appeal .
he had a religious conversion ,
so there might be an opening there .
and my people--
we &apos;re scouring ricky packer &apos;s life
for any shred of humanitarian appeal ...
right . alicia , you work with them ,
and lockhart / gardner ,
remember , we win this appeal ,
we question ricky packer ...
and that helps our client ?
packer helps us find adrianne iiver &apos;s murderer .
it &apos;s like a rube goldberg defense .
well , it &apos;ll do until we have better .
so , we will work a two @-@ pronged strategy .
kalinda , anything you can get independently on
who killed this 22nd disciple victim ...
i have access to the state attorney &apos;s office again , so ,
i &apos;ll see what i can get .
good . and again , the immediate push
has to be on this appeal .
we lose packer ,
we lose the key to the real murderer .
alicia , if you have a moment ?
sure .
sorry to make that sound so boss @-@ like .
no . it &apos;s been hard to get away .
it has .
diane &apos;s been eyeing us like we &apos;re a lawsuit waiting to happen .
it &apos;s getting a bit complicated , isn &apos;t it ?
it is .
do we need to ... pause ?
do you want to pause ?
i &apos;m afraid even if we say we will ,
we won &apos;t .
that sounds right .
this is not why i called you in here .
i know .
it &apos;s like grand central station , isn &apos;t it ?
go ahead . we &apos;ll talk later .
what does peter know ?
about us ?
uh , i @-@ i don &apos;t think anything ,
but that &apos;s never mattered to him . why ?
no reason .
did he talk to you ?
no .
look , i appreciate
that you guys have to do your due diligence here , but ,
i &apos;m not a ticking time bomb .
i don &apos;t have an intern .
i love my wife , i love my kids .
mrs. florrick , hello . robert mulvey .
how &apos;s your husband ?
he &apos;s very well , thank you , sir .
so you &apos;re here to , uh ,
hand @-@ hold me through this scandal ?
anything you need .
do i need a stiff drink ?
you guys had me scared .
is that you , sir ?
yeah .
but about ten years ago . winter break .
you guys are joking , right ?
it &apos;s the ridicule factor , sir .
like anthony weiner .
yeah , but anthony weiner took his clothes off
and photographed himself for his constituents . this is ...
you fellating santa .
i have to be blunt , sir , because that &apos;s
how tmz is gonna report it , fox is gonna repeat it ,
and jon stewart is gonna finish it--
&quot; here comes santa . &quot;
is it possible you were changing a lightbulb ?
what , between his legs ?
look , it was a joke .
i was a college kid .
yes , but it &apos;s a joke
about you fellating santa .
and santa &apos;s expression does not help .
what do you think ?
i think ...
you have the advantage of releasing it yourself
and taking some of the sting away ,
which is why you should take this seriously .
you think we should release it ?
it &apos;s coming out either way .
the only thing you can control is when and what it means .
what it means ?
you &apos;re the facebook generation , sir .
every candidate under 40 has some dumb photo
from some dumb college buddy .
krystal ball and the reindeer nose .
well , she lost .
yes .
but she didn &apos;t release it . you will .
my kids ...
my wife seeing this .
go talk to them and make them understand .
i need to think about this .
uh , one more thing , sir .
are there any more photos out there ?
of this ?
no .
of you , uh ,
in front of ... other statues ?
funny college stunts sometimes get repeated .
thank you , sir . i &apos;m sorry .
ain &apos;t ever easy , is it ?
so what , do you work here now ?
no , they &apos;re just having trouble with their computers .
they spend , like , $ 85,000 on it
when i can just do it in a few hours .
humble much ?
to be accurate ,
that was me making fun of the law firm ,
not me , you know , taking credit ...
are you still talking ? you &apos;re boring me .
hello .
marissa , do you have a moment ?
dad .
i do ... in a moment .
why don &apos;t you let zach do his work ?
i &apos;m letting zach do his work . he can multitask .
see ?
i &apos;m multitasking .
he &apos;s watching us .
act like i said something really shocking .
that &apos;s terrible .
i &apos;ve done bad things .
not as bad as the things done to me .
it was a double homicide .
ricky packer picked up two 14 @-@ year @-@ old girls from a shopping mall ,
raped them over three days ,
then slit their throats .
look , we know he &apos;s not a saint .
all we need is mitigation .
it &apos;s just ...
my daughter &apos;s their age .
i know .
it &apos;s our job .
grew up on 24th .
tough neighborhood .
what have you got ?
he was born with neuroblastoma ,
a syndrome requiring a dozen painful surgeries
before the age of five .
that &apos;s good . we can build on that .
and his mother has not visited him in prison .
bad and painful childhood ,
absentee mom-- we can work with that .
we need some photos of sadness , squalor .
my mom-- she &apos;s always talking about redemption . right ?
but redemption from what ?
from being a man ?
let &apos;s go visit the mom .
you called ?
i did call .
i need something .
footage from a blue light camera .
now why would you want access to our antigang cameras ?
oh , just one in particular .
19th and troy .
we have the killer .
no , you don &apos;t .
okay , i give you access , you give me access .
to what ?
your boss , will gardner .
what do you need ?
access .
why ?
we &apos;re investigating him .
for what ?
i don &apos;t think i can do that .
okay , kalinda , i know how you work .
you get whatt you want without giving back ,
and that &apos;s just not gonna happen here .
you want your back scratched ?
i have an itch .
okay .
what do you need ?
he had a friend .
a judge . baxter .
we need to know the nature of their relationship .
get me the blue light camera .
get me the backstory on will .
i asked first .
where &apos;d you get that jacket ?
i don &apos;t know .
can i look at the label ?
sure .
nice .
thanks .
breathes .
this is the address ?
yeah .
not much squalor .
thank you for seeing us , ms. packer .
we need to offer evidence of mitigation .
show that your son &apos;s crimes were a result of ...
um , outside causes , difficulty in childhood ,
his upbringing .
i &apos;m sorry .
i just ... it &apos;s hard .
father jim got all the neighbors together ,
and that helps .
do you have any pictures of ricky as a child ?
we want to show the judges how he grew up .
of course .
so you haven &apos;t seen your son in prison ?
no . he won &apos;t let me .
i keep writing every week , but he won &apos;t ...
we read that ricky had a lot of illnesses as a child ?
illnesses ?
yes . operations .
oh , no .
that was his brother , michael .
he &apos;s in new york now .
on wall street .
he &apos;s broken up about this .
um , what about school ?
did he have problems in school ?
oh , yes .
michael was always the weakest .
no . ricky .
oh . no . ricky was fine .
we were able to get him into a program at st. matthew &apos;s .
there &apos;s ricky .
that &apos;s a lot of presents .
well , we wanted them to have christmases we never had .
would you excuse me ?
we could always say he was too spoiled ?
she &apos;s a saint .
to have that son-- i don &apos;t understand it .
whatever he wanted , she was there .
you think he really did it , he killed those two girls ?
why ?
he liked doing mean things .
it was fun for him .
is there anything that you can say to help the court at all , anything
that would save his life ?
he shouldn &apos;t be killed .
that was a wash .
do you believe that ?
what ?
that no matter who he is ,
no matter what he did , he shouldn &apos;t be killed ?
yeah . don &apos;t you ?
i saw those photos .
those girls were my daughter &apos;s age .
they don &apos;t exist anymore .
and to get that call .
to spend every night
thinking about your daughter &apos;s last breath ...
he raped ...
did you see what he did with their bodies ?
but we don &apos;t execute him .
why not ?
because it would be wrong .
what day are you looking for ?
june 15 , the day adrianne iver disappeared .
okay .
there you go-- corner of 19th and troy .
okay . there he is .
that &apos;s the victim , right ? that &apos;s what he was wearing ?
uh , yeah . that &apos;s his corner .
&apos;kay , and that &apos;s the night ms. iver died ?
my guess is there &apos;s someone else on the corner the next night .
you want to ... you want to see the next night ?
if you &apos;d be so kind .
do you know anything about will gardner &apos;s relationship with judge baxter ?
they had a falling out .
he was a corrupt judge .
will got him thrown off the bench .
no , our office got him thrown off the bench .
gardner didn &apos;t do crap .
there .
that &apos;s the next night ?
it is .
you have the wrong man , dana .
it was a corner fight , and he took the corner .
that &apos;s why he killed the 22nd disciple--
so he could take the corner .
my guess is , that man killed adrianne iver , too .
you need to find that man .
your honors , ricky packer is a changed man .
his rehabilitation is a testament to the dignity of the human spirit
even in the face of great adversity .
we ask that you show mercy and compassion ...
i &apos;m so sorry , ma &apos;am .
that &apos;s all right .
is this good ?
yes.thank you .
mr. packer &apos;s defense attorney never availed himself
of mitigation witnesses during the penalty phase of the trial .
as you can see ,
there are many people here
who would speak to mr. packer &apos;s ... fine character .
he has changed in prison , your honors .
he had an unfortunate upbringing--
none of the opportunities that you or i have had .
just listen to his mother-- she will speak
to how hard it was for ricky ,
growing up in their tough south side neighborhood ,
how she neglected ricky as a child ,
and even now , how she has not seen her son in prison .
imagine being a child in the inner city , with no hope ...
i &apos;ve known ricky packer all his life .
i was there at his baptism .
i &apos;m here to say that ricky packer &apos;s a good person .
he &apos;s a redeemable person .
he has been led astray ,
and i take it as my own personal failing
that i didn &apos;t lead him back .
he &apos;s not a good person .
no . i said what i said so he wouldn &apos;t be killed .
and it &apos;s all right to do that ?
nothing is very clean .
the older i get the more i realize that .
what if ... what if it meant releasing him ?
then we would be having another conversation .
looks like it worked .
well , they &apos;re considering the appeal .
we have a 24 @-@ hour extension
and access to ricky packer . so , alicia ?
where is alicia ?
oh . i need you to get to indiana .
andry says ricky packer likes talking with women ,
so you talk with ricky ,
and we &apos;ll work the appeal .
all right , let &apos;s get going .
work on the appeal .
alicia ...
are you all right doing this , going to him ?
i &apos;m all right doing this .
it &apos;s my job .
okay . then head out .
just doing homework .
jennifer &apos;s coming over later for tutoring .
okay . uh , i already talked to zach ...
but i &apos;m working on this ...
case , and i don &apos;t know what time i &apos;ll be home .
so dad is gonna come over and pick you up
and take you to his place , all right ?
we can take care of ourselves , mom .
no . i already talked to dad .
and lock the door , okay , grace ?
i know sometimes we forget , but just do it .
okay .
is everything all right ?
i think so .
you come straight home from school every day , don &apos;t you ?
mom , you &apos;re getting weird .
i know .
i love you .
bye .
eli gold and mickey gunn .
i think that &apos;s the third sign
of the apocalypse-- you guys working together .
but only on something we truly believe in .
yeah .
you know robert mulvey ?
the ex @-@ congressman .
the one that flipped from republican to democrat .
i hear he &apos;s looking for a campaign he can win , isn &apos;t he ?
mickey represents him .
and we want to offer you a story .
about him ?
about mickey .
it &apos;s a sort of think piece
about the next generation of candidates .
really ! you got a headline for me , too ?
your sweat &apos;s showing , guys .
we have a picture .
it &apos;s not as bad as anthony weiner , but in our opinion ,
it encapsulates the problems of the facebook @-@ era candidate .
he slept with a campaign worker ?
that &apos;s him ?
that &apos;s robert mulvey ?
it is .
you want to hang a lantern on your problem .
hang a lantern on what ?
this has nothing to do with mulvey &apos;s policy .
this has nothing to do with his morals .
really ? servicing santa &apos;s not about his morals ?
it ain &apos;t the real santa , it &apos;s a statue .
and there is no real santa ,
so he wouldn &apos;t have a penis .
look , the real story here is mickey gunn ,
and how he deals with a photo that is ,
admittedly , ridiculous , but is also irrelevant to mulvey &apos;s character .
look , i &apos;m fine . you want to give me something ,
give me something , but why don &apos;t you put the candidate on ?
we &apos;ll see what we can do .
would you excuse me a moment ?
so , you want to cancel dinner ?
you know me . flighty .
you want something to drink ?
where are you , marissa ?
getting computer advice , dad .
i &apos;ll call you later .
how long have your parents lived apart ?
i ... what do you mean ?
don &apos;t worry , my dad told me .
when did they split up ?
about five months ago .
i &apos;ll give you all the tips on how to use it .
parents going through divorce are so guilty .
that &apos;s my dad , to come pick me up .
zach ?
grandma .
peter had to work today , so he asked me
to look in on you .
hello .
hello . i &apos;m marissa .
are you the new tutor ?
no .
i &apos;m eli gold &apos;s daughter .
oh . really ?
and , uh , what are we doing here ?
what are we doing here , zach ?
i was just showing her how to change her dad &apos;s computer settings .
grace , grandma &apos;s here !
is grace here ?
i thought you were out there trying to save the world .
i was ; now i &apos;m here .
you look serious .
an asa in peter florrick &apos;s office
is asking about your relationship with judge baxter .
you in trouble ?
i &apos;m in something .
i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m in .
who &apos;s the asa ?
dana lodge . i think she &apos;s working with cary .
is this coming from peter florrick ?
i think it is .
so it &apos;s about his wife ?
i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t know anything anymore .
i used to be able to read the political tea leaves ,
now i can barely tell why people say hello to me in the morning .
then use me .
thought you were an island these days .
mm , no man is an island .
i don &apos;t know , kalinda , this one is tough .
they &apos;re coming for me .
did you pay off baxter ?
no .
but i think i know why they think i did .
okay , then ask for my help .
i feel like hugging you .
no , just ...
just ask for my help .
you okay ?
i will be .
you need something ?
you discussed with andr ? bergson , the filmmaker , a murder ?
a buried body ?
a man becomes very popular in his last hours of life .
you said you know who killed him ?
what &apos;s your name ?
alicia florrick .
andre said to send a girl , didn &apos;t he ?
yes .
and here you are .
it would help us greatly
if you could tell us who committed this murder .
didn &apos;t the cops find someone ?
yes , a juvenile from a competing gang .
but we think it &apos;s this man .
yeah .
can you tell us who this is ?
why should i ?
we &apos;re helping you with your appeal .
yeah .
we successfully argued in front of the 7th circuit .
they just like torturing me .
they say they &apos;ll reconsider , but i &apos;ll be dead come sunday .
then why not help us ?
i heard my mom argued for me .
she did .
and my brother ?

i have never said this before ,
but i am now going to say it for you . are you ready ?
i am not a lesbian .

but a failing is a failing .
i am an alcoholic .
nice work .
changes the subject .
thanks .
the only place left to go .
i thought foolishly
that i had taken care of my problem ,
but as all alcoholics know , it &apos;s never over ,
so i &apos;m going back into the program .
all right , so i &apos;ll talk to you when he gets out .
yeah .
i like him .
not a bad guy .
still room to corrupt him .
i &apos;m thinking of him for state senate first .
s @-@ state senate here ?
yeah , what were you thinking ?
i just didn &apos;t know you were thinking local .
only as a jumping @-@ off point .
what &apos;s wrong , is that too small for you ?
my ex @-@ wife is running for state senate .

well , that &apos;s , uh , unfortunate .
yep .

it is the gun , tom lavere &apos;s gun .
we &apos;re releasing him .
you all right ?
uh , considering it was my first gunfight .
you ?
yeah , thanks for pulling me down , for protecting me .
what do you want from me , kalinda ?
what do i want from you ?
why does everybody always think that i want something ?
&apos;cause you do .
she &apos;s not attracted to women .
cary , you make me too calculated .
look , i came here , you weren &apos;t here , she was here ,
so i asked her about the case , that &apos;s all .
you &apos;ve got blood on your ear .
under .
i don &apos;t like you being in my head .

i said , i don &apos;t like you being in my head .
then get me out .
