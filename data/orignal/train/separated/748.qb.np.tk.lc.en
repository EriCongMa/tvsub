yeah , i know , ma . that bastard was a saint .
a saint .
the bastard .
i know . come here . hey .
this is getting very personal . may ...
maybe none of us should go to the funeral .
the early buzz on this thing is that it &apos;s gonna be a real drag .
so what still needs to get done ?
we need to , uh , get the groceries ,
uh , plan the funeral , call the paper ...
whoa , whoa , whoa .
did you say &quot; plan the funeral &quot; ?
that &apos;s why you &apos;re here , nicky .
you take care of everything .
i got the napkins !
oh , that &apos;s so hot .
great , jamie .
is nick taking care of people ?
yeah , with pop @-@ pop coming and going ,
nick had to step up and be the man of the family .
pretty much takes care of all of them .
don &apos;t laugh when they call him responsible .
they don &apos;t know why that &apos;s hilarious .
um ... oh ... hi , mrs. miller .
i &apos;m so sorry for your loss .
if there &apos;s anything i can do to help , i ...
who are you ?
oh , i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m jess .
this is jess , my new roommate .
um , so nice to meet you .
i &apos;ve told you about her .
winnie and fat schmidt i know . hey , boys .
i just wanted to say that
i &apos;m here and happy to do anything .
is she a spanish ?
um ... i &apos;m from portland , oregon .
land of books .
trailblazers .
are you guys , uh ...
jamie , i &apos;m begging you to shut up .
your father always wanted to have a funeral just like elvis had ,
so that &apos;s what we &apos;re gonna give him .
a funeral like elvis had ?
that means ...
12 white limos and an elvis impersonator ...
dad &apos;s gonna get the funeral
you want him to have , okay ?
so tell me what needs to get done ,
and i &apos;ll just do it .
oh , the eulogy .
you ...
you &apos;ll do the eulogy , right ?
i don &apos;t think i should do it .
you just say a bunch of nice stuff all in a row .
do it , college .
you got it .
nick , you have to .
you should do it .
come on , nicky .
you should do it .
do a good poem . do one of your good ones .
come on , man . you got to .
yeah , okay . sure . i &apos;ll , uh ...
that &apos;s my boy .
he takes care of everything .
hey .
hey , jess .
it &apos;s like a whole secret life for you .
you &apos;re not even looking at the numbers .
aunt ruthie used to call this the iron jew .
are you having time to process this ?
yeah , i &apos;m just trying to figure out
the level of elvis impersonator we can afford .
and i think a white one &apos;s out of reach .
is there anything i could do to help ?
the eulogy .
sorry ?
oh , that would be really helpful
&apos;cause that &apos;s been getting in my way a little bit .
i didn &apos;t really know your dad except ...
the one hour that i committed fraud with him .
that &apos;s all there is to know , really .
i think that &apos;s , you know , one task i think maybe is better if you ...
look , i &apos;ve got to figure out an elvis theme .
you know , elvis @-@ themed flowers
and food and music all in a day .
i just ... you asked if there was anything you could do ,
and there is .
okay .
yay ! thank you .
i &apos;ll do it .
yeah .
oh , you are the best .
hey , nick .
yeah .
for elvis @-@ themed music , what about elvis ?
i &apos;m really ... i &apos;m so slammed right now .
i can &apos;t hear , like , new stuff .
looking good , man .
this was walt &apos;s best suit .
look at all these buttons , winston .
i look like a remote control .
it looks good .
i can &apos;t mourn in this .
i don &apos;t even know how to use these buttons .
hey , look , we &apos;re not mourning , okay ?
this is a celebration , you know ?
that &apos;s what funerals are about ...
winston , i just can &apos;t go to the funeral , okay ?
i don &apos;t want to go !
what the hell is the problem ?
look , i really want to support nick . i do .
i want to support his family .
i want to be there for him , but ...
i &apos;m scared of death .
schmidt , you know , death is natural , you know ?
it &apos;s a natural part of life . everybody &apos;s scared of death .
death , winston .
death . death .
and let me ask you something , winston :
what &apos;s with this open casket thing ?
all of a sudden , i @-@ i got to walk in
and i got to see the carcass ?
that &apos;s crazy .
what if ... what if his eyes open ?
what if his eyes open ,
and then he comes and haunts all of us ? why do ... why ...
literally , why are the buttons on here ?
because they &apos;re not holding anything together ,
yet i don &apos;t know which buttons are buttoned .
how do you get this thing off , winston ? !
i don &apos;t understand this middle @-@ class button system !
get it off of me !
so i don &apos;t think i &apos;m gonna go to the funeral , man .
i think i &apos;m gonna hang back .
so , um , i &apos;m helping nick with the eulogy .
i &apos;ll give you the goods on walt , glasses face .
my pop had a table at every diner in the city .
he had silverware from the finest hotels in the area .
he had a gold chain as thick as floss .
but , like , thick floss .
wait , walt &apos;s got that chain ?
yeah , he got that chain . that &apos;s his chain .
that was my dad &apos;s chain .
no , it was walt &apos;s signature piece .
no , he got that from the seiko watch deal .
no , he got it from the dishwasher arrangement .
no , he didn &apos;t .
yes , he did .
my dad took a dart in the eye for that .
i don &apos;t care what your dad took a dart
in the eye for .
guys . guys , guys , guys .
can we refocus ?
i can &apos;t !
because he &apos;s accusing my father of thievery !
can we just talk about walt ?
yeah , so what &apos;s the deal with you and nick ? are you guys , uh ...
could you ... could you stop doing that with your eyebrows ?
please stop doing ... stop .
no .
whoever denied it supplied it .
now , this would be the casket .
and now i &apos;m dead .
so approach me and don &apos;t be afraid .
just promise not to move , all right ?
that &apos;s what i &apos;m afraid of most .
are you kidding me ?
also , you can &apos;t breathe .
schmidt , i need to breathe , okay ?
because i &apos;m coaching you , and also for regular life reasons .
now , just calm down ,
find a joyful memory
and let it lift you to the sky .
you left us too soon ,
you beautiful black butterfly .
start over .
you know , when we first met ,
i thought that we would be rivals .
for nick &apos;s attention ,
for who wore easter colors best .
and then rivalry became friendship .
we &apos;ve laughed , we &apos;ve swum .
you cut my toenails .
are you the brother that i never had ?
no .
you &apos;re the brother that i &apos;ve always had .
that was beautiful .
what are you doing , man ? !
what the hell ?
you moved ! whoa !
of course i moved !
i &apos;m not a real dead person !
you ghoul !
why do i do this for you ?
forget it , man .
i &apos;m never going to this thing .
you just made it worse .
what &apos;s wrong with you ?
$ 2,000 ?
what if it wasn &apos;t six feet under ?
how much for three feet ?
i &apos;ve gone through half a pack of ciggie gum here .
you want some of my weed ?
where are we on the food ?
we @-@ we got to have elvis food .
ma , i &apos;m making calls right now .
it &apos;s got to be perfect .
it &apos;s gonna be perfect . you just got to let me do it .
if the food isn &apos;t elvis @-@ themed , does it matter that much ?
you got a problem with elvis ?
i don &apos;t ...
no , she didn &apos;t say that .
i &apos;m gonna have to call you back . no , she didn &apos;t say that .
she didn &apos;t say that about elvis .
i was just suggesting
that maybe the elvis theme doesn &apos;t matter as much ...
you don &apos;t think elvis is important ?
she knows elvis is important , ma !
elvis is everything !
i know . he &apos;s the king . he &apos;s the king .
i &apos;m sorry , bonnie . he &apos;s the king .
jess .
nick ...
i &apos;m here to help , but i can &apos;t write this eulogy .
wait , what ?
do you want some of my weed ?
i asked you to do one thing .
i need you to write the eulogy .
but i didn &apos;t know walt .
nobody wants to hear what i have to say about my dad .
it doesn &apos;t matter what you say . you just ... you ...
you have to say good @-@ bye to him .
i &apos;m not asking you to do too much .
just write my father &apos;s eulogy .
i can &apos;t handle this !
nick .
my dad &apos;s chain !
nick .
i want that chain !
hey , nick ! nick !
he popped me right in my cherry !
that &apos;s not what that means , jamie !
then what does it mean ? !
nick !
where are you going ?
i forgot my jacket . it &apos;s really cold outside !
nick , wait !
when &apos;s the last time you saw nick ?
is he not here ?
what are you guys talking about ?
schmidt , if you want to hear what we &apos;re saying ,
come over here .
don &apos;t shout across the room .
it &apos;s bad luck to see the body before the funeral .
no , that &apos;s , like , a wedding thing , schmidt .
i think i said something to nick .
i think this is my fault .
hey , everybody ! i brought elvis !
funeral saved .
what ?
hey , happy funeral , jess .
what happened ?
what happened is i found this guy at the bar
and he fits into the costume ,
so for 20 bucks , he &apos;s gonna be elvis .
i thought you wanted me to kill elvis for 20 bucks .
then why would i give you the outfit , brendan ?
the element of surprise ?
yeah .
the mirror effect ?
he &apos;s gonna be perfect .
whose birthday is it ?
no , it &apos;s my dad &apos;s funeral .
i &apos;m gonna go find cake .
how much have you had to drink ?

dad would &apos;ve liked this .
he would &apos;ve faked a slip and fall and sued the funeral home .
but he would &apos;ve liked this .
thank you , jess .
you &apos;re welcome , mama .
i used to always tell my dad
that i hated elvis just to piss him off .
and he would get really mad ,
the way walt could get really mad .
and , uh , he would turn it up loud
just to spite me and sing all the elvis songs .
he was very good at gambling .
he had a great mustache .
hey , man .
what ?
and he was so mean to cabbies in such a cool way .
and he never was scared .
how did he do that ?
i don &apos;t know if walt was ...
a good guy or a bad guy
in the whole scheme of things , you know .
but he was my dad , and i &apos;m sure gonna miss him .
you okay , mama ?
yeah , i &apos;m gonna be okay , mama .
* &apos; cause if there &apos;s one thing that she don &apos;t need *
* it &apos;s another hungry mouth to feed *
* in the ghetto *
