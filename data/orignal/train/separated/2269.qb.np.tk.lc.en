daniel &apos;s grave .
mother !
she ripped his heart out .
all the dark deeds i &apos;ve done poisoned my heart .
who do you want found ?
my daughter .
your lilith might be the one who keeps ms. swan on her dark path .
your parents are monsters , emma .
they banished me and threw you in a wardrobe .
she wants revenge .
marian ... she &apos;s my sister zelena .
she &apos;s pregnant .
stop the carriage .
good day , citizens .
enjoying the meadow ?
indeed . it seemed perfect for our wedding ceremony .
it is lovely .
but see , the thing is ,
these are part of the royal lands ,
and i don &apos;t recall giving you permission to marry here .
we didn &apos;t know .
we had just ...
your majesty .
could you be overreacting
because of what day it is ?
don &apos;t talk to me about this day , daddy .
but you need the support of your citizens , your majesty .
to alienate them would be shortsighted and weak .
i &apos;m not weak !
i was going to spare you , but someone just made me angry .
next time there &apos;s a wedding ,
book the church .
make your way home .
i have someplace to go .
mother .
it &apos;s been too long .
so ...
yeah .
so you moved on . with her .
that &apos;s not fair . you understood .
you agreed .
understanding it and seeing it are different .
that &apos;s hardly the most important point here .
my son .
zelena &apos;s not gonna keep wearing that glamour ,
and roland &apos;s not gonna understand where his mother &apos;s gone .
for him to lose her again ...
a forgetting potion .
just take him back to before the fake marian showed up .
he &apos;ll lose time , but it &apos;s better , right ?
yes . thank you .
god , poor marian .
and zelena ...
just killing her like she meant nothing
so she could play out this sad farce with us .
i just ... i wanna ...
but i can &apos;t .
i mean , i @-@ i knew that things didn &apos;t feel right ,
but i just didn &apos;t know why .
i &apos;m sorry . this was all about me .
for her , this was all about ...
making sure i never get my happy ending .
if by happy ending , you mean us , then ...
at least , in a way , that &apos;s possible again .
look , it &apos;s messy , i know , but ...
between us ...
is a huge obstacle .
and it &apos;s going to get bigger every day ,
and not just for nine months either .
it &apos;s a lifetime she has cooking in there .
no matter what happens from now on ,
there &apos;s going to be this child .
you &apos;re tied together in a way ...
in a way we &apos;ll never be .
i &apos;m such an idiot to think
that life wouldn &apos;t kick me in the teeth again .
i hear you .
just ...
just what ?
what do we do now ?
can &apos;t believe this survived all that time .
this place that belonged to your ...
his name was neal .
he was a lot of things to me .
now he &apos;s just gone , thanks to her .
sorry ?
i think i just felt it kick .
you wouldn &apos;t want to rattle an expectant mother now , would you ?
everyone , pack up . you , too .
we &apos;re going back to storybrooke . tonight .
what is this ?
it &apos;s a bagel .
is it ?
did you hear ?
this is why i hate this place .
are you sure you wanna start the day
by tangling with the dark one ?
the dark one who can &apos;t strike back without charring his heart .
you &apos;re toothless , old dog .
so i get to give you the good news .
emma &apos;s already on her way back . and guess what ?
she didn &apos;t turn evil after all .
so i get to find my happiness ,
and you will never find yours .
now for you , never is a long , long time .
well , that &apos;s bad news .
emma &apos;s in charge of happy endings around here .
the ink has to contain her blood .
it has to governed by her dark impulses .
no dark savior ... no ink .
you okay ?
what was he saying about your heart ?
i &apos;ll be perfectly fine
once i find another way to get that ink .
you think there &apos;s a loophole ?
well , there always is .
let &apos;s go .
forget walking .
i have a better idea .
all right .
maleficent ...
this is lily .
this is your daughter .
you show up
on the anniversary of killing the man that i loved ?
to what , rub salt in the wound ?
to apologize .
i see .
how did you get out of the looking glass ?
i borrowed a rabbit .
wonderland &apos;s an amazing place .
and i &apos;ve learned a lot .
i understand now why you had to send me away .
without me , you &apos;ve become your own person , and ...
and i &apos;m very proud of you .
what do you want , mother ?
to help you .
you &apos;ve got beauty and strength and power .
i just wanna help you get that final piece ...
love .
i had that piece .
you took it and tore its heart out .
the stable boy .
daniel !
his name was daniel .
yes .
i made a terrible mistake .
you see , i was fine with a loveless marriage .
i thought you &apos;d be the same .
and now i realize that you feel things
more deeply than i do .
no , you really do .
you deserve more than i had .
little late , isn &apos;t it ?
oh , we both know that &apos;s not true .
i had an encounter with a certain wingless fairy
who told me of a
failed attempt to connect you with your soul mate .
you met tinker bell ?
indeed .
she told me , regina .
there is someone out there for you ,
someone you &apos;re fated to be with ,
and i &apos;m here to find him .
i &apos;ll believe it when i see it .
no , i mean it . i &apos;ve no reason to escape .
and with that cuff , you won &apos;t have the magic to do it either .
oh , look .
home .
dank .
isn &apos;t it ? i &apos;m glad i thought of it .
and right upstairs , our o.b. , dr. whale ,
gives the finest care this side of the fictional alps .
the perfect temporary home .
yes .
this home is temporary .
but me being in your life is not , because this ...
means forever .
okay , zelena .
you wanna start talking truth ?
tell me ,
why are you so confident ?
tell me , what &apos;s gonna make you feel safe at night
once that baby &apos;s born ?
the fact that if you kill me ,
robin will always know that you murdered
the mother of his child .
you underestimate me , zelena .
enjoy your new home .
get anything on blood magic ,
but be quick .
i &apos;ve just remembered something in the back that might help .
what are you doing here ?
what do you want ?
i want the author .
finding him was my idea before you stole it .
what &apos;s wrong with you ? you look terrible .
nothing . i &apos;m fine .
oh , it &apos;s your heart , isn &apos;t it ?
it &apos;s finally happening .
yeah .
it &apos;s dying .
bad news for you and me both .
you said it would kill your ability to love .
you didn &apos;t say that ...
the dark one can &apos;t die , not like that .
no ,
but rumplestiltskin can .
a friendly warning ...
you don &apos;t wanna face the dark one
when there &apos;s no one else at home .
so i suggest you don &apos;t antagonize me .
oh , but it doesn &apos;t really matter .
by definition , when i get my happy ending ,
i &apos;ll be ... guess what ?
happy .
so i don &apos;t really care what you &apos;ll be up to .
no , you ...
you &apos;re just being shortsighted .
look .
i have the quill .
you and i can ...
work together .
we -- we could figure out a way to -- to find that ink .
yes , you look like you &apos;re up for some serious collaboration .
thank you .
i &apos;ll figure out the ink on my own .
no , no , no .
good @-@ bye , dearie .
no .
you are too good for this place , m &apos;lady .
you &apos;d be surprised .
who are you ?
they call me nottingham .
the sheriff of nottingham , actually .
come .
my name &apos;s cora ,
and i &apos;m looking for a man .
well ...
a specific man .
he has a tattoo on his arm of a lion ...
right here .
robin hood .
sounds like you &apos;re talking about robin hood .
tell me more , sheriff .
oh , no , no , no , you don &apos;t want him , darling .
he is a sanctimonious blowhard
who thinks he &apos;s better than all the other thieving bastards
because he steals from the rich ...
to give to the poor and won &apos;t shut up about it .
that sounds insufferable .
but my daughter has her heart set on him .
the things we do for our children .
well , he &apos;s all married up now , i hear ,
to some sickly little tart that no one else would want .
wives can be gotten rid of , so i hear .
i think i could help you find him ...
for a price .
maybe i &apos;m closer to finding what i was looking for than i realized .
let &apos;s talk some more .
so if i have this straight ,
you thought emma was going to go dark , and she didn &apos;t .
so the whole operation &apos;s dead ?
right .
the energy of her darkest potential has to charge the ink .
okay , let &apos;s think .
it &apos;s a shame . i mean ...
writing a happy ending for the evil queen .
well , you -- you &apos;ve always been a favorite of mine .
very clear goals plus totally damaged personality
with a self @-@ destructive streak ?
a recipe for compelling .
and of all the characters i &apos;ve written for ,
you really do get screwed over the most .
i &apos;m well aware .
by the way , i @-@ i was only working with rumplestiltskin
because he was able to protect me .
so , you can trust me .
and you can really do as you say ?
take a look at this .
this page ...
it says my happy ending is possible , doesn &apos;t it ?
i mean , it has to exist for a reason .
i wrote this .
i mean , the story with this drawing in it , from my ...
well , a @-@ a little experimental writing i did
for another book that i never got the chance to write .
where did you get this ?
it just turned up one day in robin &apos;s things .
i don &apos;t know how that happened , but it --
yeah , it suggests that something is looking out for you .
something ?
well , could you be more vague ?
you know as well as i ,
there are forces greater than all of us .
but no matter how you got that , gosh , i am a fan .
i &apos;d be happy to write whatever you want if ...
you only had the ink .
oh , i already figured that part out .
i know exactly where to find it .
you &apos;re so beautiful .
sorry . i just ...
just ... you are , that &apos;s all .
so how are we gonna get revenge
on snow white and prince charming ?
now that i see you ,
i don &apos;t wanna waste our time on revenge .
i understand why you want it .
it &apos;s suddenly so clear we should only look forward .
seriously ?
we &apos;re gonna let them get away with this ?
we can be happy in the future
or we can be angry about the past .
let &apos;s do both .
look , all these years since i figured out what happened ,
i @-@ i &apos;ve been trying to figure out
how two humans could get me away from a freakin &apos; dragon .
but now i get it .
you &apos;re a pushover .
what &apos;d they do , rub your belly ?
give you a dragon treat ?
lily ...
no .
i did everything i could .
but all i wanna do now is enjoy our time together .
i am your mother .
well , i &apos;m grown up now .
i don &apos;t need grooming advice from annie hall .
i gotta go .
wait ! wait .
please .
if you go , if you leave town , you can &apos;t get back in .
i can &apos;t leave at all .
i &apos;ll crumble back into the dust
that i was before gold revived me .
man , that &apos;s a bummer .
please .
can &apos;t you just wait a little while longer ?
things could look different in a week .
send me a postcard .
david .
i &apos;m not here to kill you .
okay ...
i just ... i just want my daughter .
lily isn &apos;t with you ?
she &apos;s leaving .
and you think we can help .
come in .
you cast the second curse . can you ...
is there a way for you to seal the borders the way regina did ?
i don &apos;t know how to do what you want .
but that wouldn &apos;t be the right way , anyway .
if she &apos;s upset ,
you have to get to the heart of what &apos;s wrong .
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s wrong . i don &apos;t know her .
well , she &apos;s acting a lot like emma did when she first came here .
she had these ...
her walls were always up .
she was afraid that if she opened herself up to me ,
i would let her down like everyone else had .
and ... ultimately , i did .
if you have any way to help ...
you didn &apos;t give her back to me then ,
but please , if you can help ,
do it now .
yes .
come on , david , let &apos;s find her .
thought i might find you here .
fair warning --
bus service in these parts can be spotty .
it &apos;s going to be a wait .
missed the part where that &apos;s your problem .
shove off .
i bet that mouth got you lots of attention
back at the group home ,
but it doesn &apos;t work here .
now ...
listen up .
i &apos;ve got some talking to do .
cora .
how ... i thought ...
yes , hello , get out , henry .
why are you here ?
i have news .
i found your man .
you found him ?
he &apos;s on his way .
he &apos;s on his way ?
mother .
come .
you remembered .
i love this color .
i can &apos;t believe you did all this .
i told you , i &apos;ve learned .
thank you ,
for the dress .
oh , you &apos;re welcome , darling .
now turn around and meet him .
your majesty .
i think i &apos;ll leave the two of you alone .
enjoy your evening together .
you know , this apple tree
used to stand near where i grew up ?
there was a stable boy i liked once ,
and we used to meet underneath it .
stable boy ?
well , you certainly have come up in the world
since consorting with a lowly stable boy , i &apos;d say .
have i ?
i don &apos;t feel like i &apos;ve gone anywhere but down .
oh , you just need ...
some manly arms to lift you up .
now you let me be the strong one
so that you can be weak when you want to be .
weak ?
feminine .
manly arms ...
like these ?
hello , there .
glory of ...
what are you doing ? !
that &apos;s not a real tattoo . that &apos;s magic .
who put that on there ?
stop it .
was it mother ? !
yes !
she told me to pretend to be your soul mate ,
and that i could be the king .
ah , just get it off me !
what does she get out of it ?
just stop it !
what does she get out of it ? !
she said that she wanted you to have a child .
what ?
she said she wanted you to have a child .
and i -- and i don &apos;t know why .
you know about snow and charming getting you banished ,
putting emma &apos;s potential for darkness into you .
sent me through the portal in my eggshell ,
like baby moses in his basket .
and unless you have any ideas
about giving them what they deserve ...
let &apos;s not worry about what they deserve .
let &apos;s work on what we deserve .
i deserve them dead .
you do have some darkness in you , don &apos;t you ?
thing is , a lot of that darkness ,
that actually belongs to emma .
and right now , it &apos;s good and riled up .
and riled up savior darkness is exactly what i need .
the only thing you need , lady , is to get out of my way .
and here i thought we could have a civil conversation .
guess i should just cut to the chase .
stop !
you &apos;re out of your mind !
welcome to storybrooke .
lily ?
lily .
so how did it go ?
he &apos;s not still here , is he ?
oh , but he is .
he wanted to see the dungeon .
oh , for heaven &apos;s sake , you &apos;re having a tantrum .
there .
he &apos;s home now , poor thing .
why &apos;d you let him go ?
don &apos;t you want someone else to suffer for what you did ?
like usual .
i don &apos;t understand .
i thought you were getting along .
i haven &apos;t known a lot of love in my life ,
but ...
i do know
that &apos;s not what a soul mate feels like .
your so @-@ called &quot; soul mate &quot; is a married ,
moralizing sap .
the one i found is much better .
you were never interested in my happiness .
hello , zelena .
oh , visitors .
i &apos;ll put the kettle on .
i &apos;ve got the author and i &apos;ve got the ink .
i wanted you to witness the moment
he writes me my heart &apos;s desire .
see , this is my town
and this is my story .
you &apos;ve just been a supporting player this whole time .
yeah , see , i &apos;m not here to support you .
i &apos;m here to replace you .
out with the old , and in with the new .
really ?
we &apos;ll see about that .
wait .
what exactly is he going to write ?
oh , i &apos;ve given that a lot of thought .
there are so many good options .
but i think , after much deliberation ,
i &apos;ve come up with the perfect ending for you , sis .
what are we lookin &apos; at ?
the horizon .
is it doing something ?
well , i just thought you &apos;d find it calming .
it is . so is rum .
emma , i can tell that your heart is uneasy .
and it &apos;s my job -- well ,
i hope it &apos;s my job , to protect your heart ,
even when no one is physically trying to steal it .
you don &apos;t have to stop me from going after gold .
i &apos;m smarter than that .
he didn &apos;t turn my heart dark ,
and i &apos;m not gonna fall into one of his traps .
i &apos;m not worried about him getting to your heart .
i was talking about your parents .
oh , we talked about this .
i talked , you walked away .
i just wanna know , is anything gonna be enough ?
or are you willing to lose them just to spite them ?
gimme back the rum .
they &apos;ve done a lot of good .
turned themselves into heroes .
yes . i know they didn &apos;t own up to what they did .
but did you ever think maybe they were ashamed ?
and they wanted you to like them .
i &apos;d like them more if ...
i &apos;d known they turned themselves around .
i like when people find their good hearts along the way .
they were trying to protect you , swan , twice .
before you were born , they wanted to make you happy .
and when they found you again , they wanted to make you proud .
do you want both those to be failures ?
it headed this way .
she .
thank you .
i &apos;m worried .
you need to be taught to fly , and she was way too low .
if one wing tip hit a tree , she could be badly hurt .
and maybe hurt a lot of people around you , too .
david .
oh , she ...
she looks like me .
be careful .
she &apos;s my daughter .
mary margaret , no !
stop ! she &apos;s out of control !
mary margaret !
no !
mom ? !
she hit her head hard .
no , stay still .
it &apos;s gonna take time to heal inside .
i &apos;m sorry i let you down again .
you didn &apos;t .
no , i was selfish .
yes , you were , but at some point this has to stop .
emma , i &apos;m not ever going to stop trying to protect you , not ever .
i don &apos;t care what you do or say .
i know .
i need to stop punishing you .
you do ?
you &apos;re a hero .
if it happened at my expense , it doesn &apos;t change anything .
it doesn &apos;t change the good person you became ,
and it doesn &apos;t change what you are .
which is what ?
my mom .
you wanted to make me proud ,
so you li-- omitted the truth ,
which was kind of self @-@ defeating , but human .
cutting you out and trying to hurt you
has just made me miserable .
anyway , i miss you
and i forgive you .
are you all right ?
i &apos;m not sure just yet .
you know , i was going to give you something earlier .
this was supposed to be yours ,
but i never got a chance to give it to you .
it &apos;s too late , isn &apos;t it ?
you &apos;re too grown up for everything .
you don &apos;t need me .
and i know that i &apos;m not ...
i &apos;m not what you were hoping for .
i thought that you &apos;d be this scary dragon bitch ,
and we &apos;d go get our revenge .
you know , blasting all those who did us wrong .
but you &apos;re just ... this real person .
and you &apos;re so frickin &apos; open , it kills me .
why does that kill you ?
i don &apos;t understand . please , tell me .
because you want a relationship ,
a future .
and anyone who &apos;s ever wanted that with me , it &apos;s just ...
it &apos;s never worked out .
i &apos;ve always let them down .
i destroy everything that i touch .
that darkness they put in me , it &apos;s serious business .
i don &apos;t mind a little darkness .
look ...
why don &apos;t you stay for a week ,
and i can teach you about being a scary dragon bitch ?
okay .
one week .
you &apos;re just mad because i have with robin hood
what you &apos;ve always wanted .
a child .
no , i already have a child .
henry .
no , what i &apos;m mad about is you trying to come between us .
about you trying to hurt me .
now i &apos;m going to see to it that you can never
hurt anyone else again .
our author here is going to write you out of the story .
forever .
sorry , sis .
i think you &apos;re bluffing .
you &apos;d never take away robin &apos;s baby .
that &apos;s not how i look at it .
you see , as far as everyone will be concerned , including me ,
it &apos;ll be as though you never existed .
wait , can he do that ?
just change all of your memories ?
absolutely .
the pen is mightier than the ...
well , everything .
i never knew our mother ,
but i imagine i &apos;m getting to know her right now .
is that so ?
she tossed me in a basket , sent me to oz .
she gave up a baby without even blinking an eye .
and look at you now .
you are exactly like her !
you &apos;ll never be happy .
you don &apos;t know how .
but you do understand power ,
and you &apos;re about to lose it .
your people want snow white to be queen .
and unless you start building a dynasty ,
she &apos;ll take back the kingdom , and you &apos;ll lose it all .
and when i die of a mysterious illness ,
you &apos;re the power behind the child @-@ sized throne , right ?
well , guess what , mother ?
i found a way to keep that from ever happening .
what is that ?
a potion ,
to take away your future claim on the royal line .
but you &apos;re not pregnant .
and now i never will be .
i won &apos;t be a baby mill for you , mother .
you &apos;d never do that . this is a sham .
is it ?
you made it clear .
you don &apos;t think anyone &apos;s going to love me .
so why not make it official ?
after all ,
love is weakness .
i was wrong about that .
the man ... i really thought he was a good match .
i &apos;m very sorry .
now , we both know you &apos;re not going to drink that ,
so put it down and we can fix this .
you don &apos;t think i &apos;m strong enough to do this ?
stupid girl .
you think it &apos;ll make you strong to hurt yourself ?
oh , it does if it hurts you more .
no . no .
get the hell out of my life !
oh , regina .
i really did come here to help you .
i love you .
i wanted you to have a child for your own sake .
if i wanted to take your power ...
i &apos;d find a much more direct way .
now please take one last piece of motherly advice .
i hope you learn
what it &apos;s taken me a lifetime to realize about myself .
the only one standing in the way of your happiness
is you .
go back to wonderland , mother .
i don &apos;t need you .
well , the ink is drying .
so what do you want me to do ?
nothing .
you didn &apos;t know our mother , zelena , but i did .
and yet , we both suffered .
she hurt you and she hurt me , too .
but our own worst enemy isn &apos;t her
or each other .
it &apos;s ourselves .
regina !
is everything all right ?
i &apos;ve been looking all over for you .
everything &apos;s fine .
i &apos;m so tired of standing in the way of my own happiness ,
and i &apos;m not going to do it anymore .
another woman defining her happiness
relative to the love of a man .
it &apos;s sad , really .
oh , don &apos;t get it wrong , greenie .
robin isn &apos;t my happy ending .
my happy ending is finally feeling at home in the world .
robin &apos;s just a part of that world .
a world that you &apos;re going to be forced to watch from a distance ,
with the most restrictive visitation rights in history .
see you at the next ultrasound .
so you don &apos;t want me writing anything ?
no .
i already have everything i need .
well , i don &apos;t .
regina !
what the ...
no .
what does it say ?
&quot; vanishing in a cloud of smoke ,
the author slips away
&quot; with the ink to where ...
mr. gold awaits . &quot;
how ?
no , no .
i don &apos;t care how .
and i don &apos;t wanna waste time .
that &apos;s what i thought .
are you okay here ?
i soon will be .
here .
let go of me .
go and write .
write on what ?
now then ...
it &apos;s time villains finally win .
