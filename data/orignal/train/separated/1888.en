Can two people really be meant to be...
And I had to rearrange some of your surgeries.
M.F.E.O.?
Check the O.R. board for any changes.
Soul mates?
I have one last thing to say.
Some of you, uh, may run into Arizona Robbins today.
It's her first day back.
So if you see her, just make her feel welcome.
Or maybe...
Maybe just don't make a big deal at all.
It might be better.
Noted. Thank you.
Oh, oh, hold on. I just want to address one more thing.
Um, most of you are aware that a group of our doctors
have filed a lawsuit against our hospital.
Some of you may be wondering what this all means
and how it's gonna affect our staff.
I'd like to be clear.
It doesn't... at all.
Let's just let the lawyers worry about that.
That's their job.
Our job is to continue to work together
and support each other in giving the great standard of care
that we have always given.
Let's not let something like this get in the way of that.
Thank you.
It would be nice if it's true...
That we all have someone out there waiting for us...
Us waiting for them.
That was good.
Anything else?
Uh, yeah. Um...
The fire house.
I'm not staying there anymore,
so I was wondering what we should do.
I mean, if we should sell it or...
I wondered what you wanted to do.
You should do what you like.
It's your house.
I'm just not sure I believe it.
Red eagle has landed.
What?
Arizona just got here.
I had an intern wait at the entrance
and then text me when they saw her.
I also put the weirdo over there on wheelchair duty.
Now listen, she'll be tired and in pain
but she won't ask for it unless she sees it's close by.
Just don't shove it...
in her face. She hates that.
You know what I hate? That you won't stop talking.
Well, then you two will get along just fine today.
Oh, red eagle.
Red eagle. Don't--don't-- don't look up.
Don't look up. Don't look up.
Keep reading, yeah.
Hi.
Robbins.
Oh, hey. Good. You're here.
Well, I gotta run.
Derek's all "Fix my hand."
"No rest till I'm healed." Rawr.
We got a big schedule.
Uh, there was a 9 year old that came in last night
with abdominal pain,
Uh, a 6 year old with a wilms' tumor,
Um, oh, there's a 10 year old that needs a kidney transplant.
Uh, you know, he's a really cool kid. You're gonna like him.
Well, call them back and get the deposit back then.
Well, I'm glad your sister likes the view,
but I'm the one who has to put on the poufy dress.
You know what? This conversation is over.
Well, I love you, too.
Red panties and a lace bra.
He wants to have a christmas wedding...
in a-a rustic mountain lodge
with red ribbons and mistletoe and a tree
with ornaments made of our photos.
Aw. That sounds beautiful.
No, it's stupid.
What kind of self-respecting man
cares this much about a wedding?
I did.
Yeah, but I did the wedding thing before.
I'm gonna make all those people who showed up the first time
sit through another ceremony because,
uh, maybe I'll mean it this time?
You were there with Adele.
You got me a set of ramekins.
And I'd be happy to get you another set.
I want to get married in a field with wildflowers everywhere
and butterflies that are released when I say "I do."
Oh, and I want to have these little mints that say "Mint to be."
You get it? 'cause they're mints--
There will be no mints. We're going to the courthouse,
have a little cocktail party after.
Yeah, we'll see about that.
A man who puts down a deposit
is a man who means business.
Well, he has the 12th to get his money back.
That's two days.
He'd need two years to get me to agree to a wedding
with Santa Claus running around.
Wait. Um, today's the 10th?
Yep.
It was good that Owen said that about the lawsuit.
What, his "One big, happy family" crap?
It's very sweet unless you're me.
It needed to be said.
Yeah, unless you're the deformed wife
chained in the attic.
Well, what do you want to be to him?
You left him. Do you want to be something else?
Well, I don't want to be chained in the attic.
Hey, guys, have you seen Jackson?
He's not answering my texts.
Why, you looking for some Jackson action?
Oh, my god. What did I tell you?
30 years as a nun, she cannot get enough.
Um, so you haven't seen him?
No, but we will tell him
that you really, really, really need to see him if--
Bye, April.
Okay, so if we go to the axilla...
and then down the forearm to grab the M.A.B.C.,
there are two branches.
Okay, now this is the really cool part, okay?
It's so freakin' state-of-the-art,
I can't even believe it exists.
That's a lot of build-up. Better be good.
We take just the anterior branch
and we use that part for the cable graft.
What else you got?
Did you hear what I just said?
Yeah. What else you got?
Okay. Yeah.
We could, um...
do an end-to-side transfer.
The, um, statistics are really, really good.
What else?
Derek, I went to the trouble of making a slide.
Could you please look at it?
You know as well as I do
that those stats come from studies on rats.
And as far as the end-to-side transfer,
yeah, it's state-of-the-art,
but once you take away my good nerve,
I will have less function than I did before.
You don't have it. Keep trying.
I practiced with Arizona last night.
She made a much more enthusiastic Derek.
What's wrong?
Dr. Bailey,
did you know the ten coldest counties in the country
are all located in Minnesota?
Um, you're glad to be back. I'm glad you're glad.
Now did you double-check
the history of the heart valve like I asked?
Grumpy.
Yes, and based on the history,
we've chosen a pericardial bioprosthesis.
I made sure the O.R. has it ready.
Okay, and, Dr. Ross,
you took care of our room situation?
East-facing window like he likes.
It's also private.
Good. Okay.
Hey.
We've arrived!
Hi. Dr. Bailey!
How does the liver look? Is it a good one?
The best.
Dr. Ross spent the last 24 hours on the phone with U.N.O.S.
to make sure it didn't go anywhere else.
They were threatening to send it to Portland,
but I went all "Dr. Bailey" on 'em.
That's my man.
A little thank-you for all your hard work.
Thank you. Oh.
For you. White birch rosemary.
And... look at you.
What's new on the wedding front?
Have you gotten a wedding dress?
You know it's all about the dress.
He got knocked down by some woman at the mall
and fell pretty hard into a perfume stand.
He's got some abdominal pain and a deep lac on his hand.
All right. Why aren't you suturing him?
I paged plastics.
The patient's a little difficult.
Okay, well, you're a doctor.
It's your job to deal with difficult.
I know, but...
Mr. Freeman, I'm Dr. Grey.
Do you mind if I examine you?
All yours.
Great. Okay.
Please let me know if you feel any pain--
I'm sorry.
Dad! I am so sorry.
Ignore him.
Dad, I swear to god.
This is why Danny and Tim don't talk to you anymore.
I never grabbed Tim's ass.
No, you grabbed Tim's wife's ass,
and Danny's wife.
It's okay. It's okay.
Okay. I need you to lean forward for me.
And take a deep breath for me, please.
Another one.
Oh. And we're done here.
What is wrong with you?
It's a compliment.
It's horrifying.
I tried to warn you.
You did a lousy job.
There's some abdominal tenderness,
so let's get a C.T.,
and get me the results right away.
Grey, I just got out of surgery.
You got a patient with a hand lac?
Yeah, he's over there. And watch your ass.
What do...
Jackson, we need to talk.
I...
Right now.
All right.
What's up?
I'm late.
For what?
Four days. I have never been four days late in my life.
Four days late for... oh.
Of course.
Just when I start thinking that maybe this could work...
Something that feels so good can't be bad, right?
I...I don't know. Maybe Jesus is okay with premarital sex.
He made that rule when people got married at 16.
He never expected people to wait till they were 30.
But now I have a baby in my uterus,
and it is clear that he is not okay with it.
Okay, Jesus. I get it.
Relax, okay? You're not pregnant.
I am a clock. I am never late.
We use condoms.
Condoms break.
They don't break.
Wh...
Sometimes they break. Just...
W...we're gonna have you pee on a stick,
and we'll know in five minutes.
No. No. Those things can give off false positives.
It...it has to be a blood test.
Fine. You're right.
We'll go draw your blood right now. Okay?
Jackson...
Hey, we are not gonna worry
until we know for sure.
Okay?
Okay.
Dr. Kepner, we need you.
14 year old in a horseback riding accident.
Hypotensive and bleeding through his bandages.
I'm around all day,
So just...just text me later.
Wexler, Lewis, trauma one now.
Hey, Avery, you're helping me research a plan
for Shepherd's hand today.
Uh, can it wait?
I'm a little busy.
Oh, well, every second,
the nerve is dying a little bit more.
As we stand here and argue, his nerve is dying.
Yes, but...
Oh, his nerve died just a little bit more.
Let's go. Snap, snap.
Hunt. Nice speech this morning.
Very, "Once more unto the breach, dear friends."
Shakespeare. You know, "Henry v."
I mean, the point is that you...
you're handling all this well.
Thanks. You...need something?
Uh, just checking in.
You...you all right with this, meeting?
Yeah, I'm just telling them what happened. Why?
Oh, no reason.
It's just, you know, a lawsuit like this,
reminds a hospital that it's a business.
The angles change pretty quickly.
So don't let them back you in a corner.
I should be fine.
Of course. Of course. Look, you know what you're doing.
Just ignore me.
Dr. Hunt,
as I'm sure you're aware, members of your staff
have now lodged an official complaint
with intent to sue Seattle Grace Mercy West hospital. I am.
So today is just a preliminary interview
to prepare the hospital's case.
This is a confidentiality agreement.
You can look it over. It just says that...
You should make note that it specifically mentions
your wife-Dr. Cristina Yang
as one of the plaintiffs in the case.
Yeah, I saw that.
So we understand, this is an unusual situation for you
and a clear conflict of interest for the hospital.
Don't worry. Whatever we say here will stay here.
Great. No awkward conversations around the dinner table.
Okay, so let's start
with why your team flew to Boise Memorial on that day.
Boise asked us to help with a conjoined twin separation.
We'd had success with a very complicated procedure months earlier.
Graham Cunningham, 65,
Presented with cirrhosis approximately seven years ago.
He's now in end-stage liver disease
and has subsequently also developed valvular heart disease.
Well done, Dr. Ross.
I've been practicing.
Why didn't we treat this valve disease ear...
Right away? Because the valve replacement surgery
would've caused his liver to fail.
But the liver transplant would've caused his heart to fail.
That's why we'll do both surgeries today.
First the valve replacement, then the liver transplant.
Good.
You almost make me want to learn your name.
Dr. B., you're confident this liver's the one?
We're not gonna get halfway to the O.R.
and have to turn around like last time?
All signs point to this being the one.
We just had to date a bunch of others to find it.
Kind of like you,
kissing all those frogs before you met me.
A dirty old man touched my butt today, twice.
Really?
How was your day? How was Callie?
Well, she didn't touch my butt.
Derek.
What?
I'm all for burying things with sex,
but this is your career.
You want to talk about it?
Yes.
Why do the surgery at all?
I've always wanted to spend more time fishing.
I just got Zola her first fishing pole. It's pink.
Derek.
There is no good solution.
There's half fixes.
Maybe there's more function. Maybe there's not.
And if they can't fix it, then that's it.
It's done. It's over.
It's not over. You find a fix.
You used to be so dark and twisty.
Now you're optimistic.
We're not talking about me.
Let's just not talk at all.
That's it. Good.
Avoid twisting the cables too tightly
or they'll cut through the sternum.
What is this I hear about you letting your intern
do a procedure on my patient?
You tattled on me?
I didn't spend the last three months on liver watch
so you could kill this guy.
Hey, no one's killing anyone.
She's good. Better than you.
No gloating.
Yang.
Do you know how long this man's waited for a liver?
So long he was married to a woman
the first time he came in here.
Now he's come out.
He's met the man he's meant to spend the rest of his life with.
This is not the man we let an intern practice on.
Okay, relax. She won't do it.
Since when did you become such a romantic?
You're lucky you even get to work with me.
Does that hurt at all, Sean?
Good. Good.
All right. You having any fun here?
I heard there was a pro basketball player
aaking his way around the halls here.
Did you get to meet him? Tall guy.
He probably hit his head on the door on the way in.
All right. Well, we will, um, check back with you later.
Bye.
Good job.
You said $20 if I didn't ask about the fake leg.
I only got $10 on me.
Then next time she comes in,
I'm gonna tell her how you told me
that I couldn't say anything.
Keep your trap shut.
Hey, is he alway that quiet?
Oh, yeah. Strange kid.
Dr. Robbins, Dr. Kepner needs some extra hands
on a horse trampling-- 14 year old.
All right. Tell 'em we're on our way.
Yeah. Um, I'll catch up with you.
No, I can wait.
No, a kid got trampled by a horse, Alex. Go.
Can I help you?
No. Um...
I just got lost
on my way to...
radiology.
Can you take over the ultrasound?
He's got abdominal tenderness,
and I need to get control of this bleeding.
I think he may have lacerated his femoral vein.
My sneakers.
What's that?
Don't lose my sneakers.
They're 200 bucks.
That's why his leg slipped through the stirrup.
You have to wear a shoe with a heel when you ride a horse.
Kid spends 200 bucks on sneakers,
he's obviously not the king of awesome choices.
All right, there's possible blood on the upper left quadrant.
Great. Let's get him up to C.T.
Hold on. Wait for Robbins.
Uh, are you kidding me?
She's on her way.
He just got dragged 20 yards by a horse.
He's totally stable. Look, it's her first day back.
He did a stupid thing.
I'm not gonna let it ruin his life.
Let's move this gurney right now.
Right away, doctor.
Okay, somebody step out and call.
Let's go.
It looks like...
there's some calcification of the aortic annulus here?
Is that a statement or a question?
I...
will check again.
Oh, no.
Look at that. He comes bearing bad news.
It's gonna be fine.
The plane taking the transplant team got delayed by rain.
We'll know more in an hour.
We've heard that before.
You don't know. Maybe this is a good thing.
Like maybe the plane has to be late
so the transport ambulance doesn't crash into a 18-wheeler .
Things happen for a reason.
Here we go.
Well, they do.
I always say,
I would never have met Hank if my ex--Carol--
hadn't forced us to move to Seattle
to be closer to her family.
You wasted 30 years in that marriage.
No, it wasn't a waste. It got me here. I met you.
30 years too late.
Better late than never.
Things don't always happen for a reason, Graham.
I was alone all that time, and you were scared.
and I don't believe that that's the way
things were supposed to be.
We were supposed to be together,
have our entire lives together.
So I can't just sit back and be okay with you losing
the one thing that can get me my 30 years with you.
I'm sorry.
He's just a little scared.
You're damn right I am.
You don't screw this up.
We won't.
Dr. Ross, you'll make sure that the liver gets here?
If I have to drive to Oregon and pick it up myself.
See? Maybe that's why I had to say things happen for a reason,
so you'd yell at them.
Good news. Your scans came back clean.
So you're free to go home.
Oh, thank god. You got lucky this time.
The next lady in the mall might have a gun.
And so Dr. Wilson can assist you
with any other questions that you may have,
and I will write you the prescription
for the painkillers
Nice.
That's enough!
I am all you've got left, dad. And I'm done.
You sit around and mope about how mom left you,
but of course she did.
You'd be crazy to stay married to you.
How long has this been going on, the touching?
I don't know.
My mom left him, like, two years ago,
but it was at least a year before that.
And before that?
He was... normal.
He was my dad.
Dr. Grey, what's going on?
Excuse me for a second.
Did you see the way he was grabbing my pen?
Mm-hmm. That's a grasping reflex.
It's a frontal release sign.
I thought that went away after infancy.
Well, it does unless you have a tumor in your frontal lobe,
In which case, primitive reflexes come back
along with disinhibition.
Patients start becoming impulsive,
saying things they shouldn't.
Grabbing ass. You're so smart.
Stop sucking up.
Go get a C.T. And page neuro.
Oh, I'm about to head back into my meeting.
Um, Bailey and I are doing the heart-liver surgery today.
I-I-I'm lead cardio on it,
And Russell wanted you to sign off on it.
Okay. That all?
No. Why am I here?
What?
You pushed to have me back.
I am curious why, because you don't seem to want me here.
Oh, you're gonna do great things, Cristina,
and I'm running a hospital.
I'd ther have you do that under our banner.
You're good business.
That's the only reason?
You moved away.
You asked me to stop calling you.
Now you're back. What--what do you want?
I don't--I don't know. That's--
Well, let me tell you what we do know.
We want different things.
Every time we try to ignore that,
we end up hurting each other.
We don't work.
That's what we know.
And that hasn't changed.
Nothing's changed at all. I have to go back to my meeting.
The brochure has a picture of the place
decorated with icicle lights
and those reindeer made out of twigs.
That's gross.
Ooh, what about a cupcake tower
instead of a cake?
You could do red and green frosting.
Oh, come on.
You guys are in love. Why not celebrate that?
'Cause sometimes love makes you do stupid things.
Suddenly you're screwed the rest of your life.
What he said.
Why are you even talking?
I need that answer about the radial nerve transfer.
Yeah. Slow reader here.
Hey.
Hey. Oh, Arizona.
Hey, Dr. Robbins. Uh, you're working with horse kid, right?
Uh, yeah, I am. Karev's got him in pre-op.
And Dr. Kepner, was she also in pre-op or is she probably--
Excuse me. Why would she know where your girlfriend is?
Read the article.
Hey, um, I'm gonna do an exploratory lap
on this kid tonight, so I might be home a little late.
You're doing exploratory surgery your first day back?
That's a lot of standing. You think that...
you might get bored?
'Cause I get bored just standing.
And sitting--I also get bored sitting.
Hey. Uh, Bailey and Ben are having a Christmas wedding.
They're gonna have carolers.
Oh, I love christmas carolers.
There will no carolers.
来3125房间见我
Torres, I'm gonna be right back.
No, no, no. I need you here.
Jackson.
Sorry. I thought you were...
You two having a sex date?
We are not having a sex date.
Not everything is about sex.
You okay?
Yes.
No.
Oh, god.
April?
I had plan.
I was gonna be married and have a husband.
Our wedding would have the--the mints.
We'd be...
"mint to be," committed.
I was gonna tell my husband that I was pregnant
by giving him a T-shirt that said "World's greatest dad."
Now look at me.
You're pregnant?
I think so.
Well, I don't know.
Plans never work out the way you think they're going to,
especially with babies.
You try and try to get pregnant, and you can't.
And then a baby comes when you least expect it,
probably because you didn't plan it.
Plans don't mean anything.
I was just leaving.
Tell us about your decision
in using Skytrip Express as the charter company.
It wasn't my decision.
The hospital has a deal with that company.
Has the hospital always used that company?
I have no idea.
Were you aware that Skytrip had a history of mechanical issues?
What?
F.A.A. reports 4 incidents since July 2010.
No, I didn't. Of course I didn't.
You don't remember switching to Skytrip
from another charter company last December?
I'm not...
I'm--I wasn't aware of that.
I-I run a surgical staff. I'm not a--
In a round of budget cuts heading into fiscal 2012,
transportation policy shifted
from your previous company to Skytrip,
who it appears subcontracts to several smaller companies--
Who had mechanical issues.
That's right.
This is how we save money,
by jeopardizing our people's lives?
Who are vetting these guys?
Who approved switching to a company
without checking their damn safety records?
Is this your signature, Dr. Hunt?
I don't remember this specifically, but...
yes.
Yes, I approved this. I...
I did it.
So what happens now, I resign?
This interview is just to ascertain--
That is the last thing that we want.
I'm sorry. Can I interject something here, off the record?
Dr. Hunt, I am Roberta Thompson.
I am new to the board.
Yeah, we've met.
Right.
Um, I just want to be clear here.
You said it yourself.
You run a surgical staff,
and you do a hell of a job at it.
You wouldn't do it so well if we expected you
to chase down every zero on a budget report.
Owen... a mistake was made...
an oversight,
and it cost us, all of us.
God knows it cost our doctors.
And you, your own wife has paid a terrible price for this,
but the board wants you to know
that you have our full support in this.
You okay?
Yeah.
You?
Yeah.
I don't know.
I know.
I guess I should've been on the pill.
Yeah, I guess we were both pretty stupid.
Jackson, I can do this myself, you know?
What?
Just, if this isn't what you want... Why--
What the hell, Kepner? Our surgery's about to start.
I'm anemic.
S.T.D. screen.
Great timing, though, 'cause I just finished.
And can you get that?
Perf--thank you.
Yeah.
All righty. And see ya.
Dr. Bailey.
Hey. We're almost ready for you.
After this bile duct, we'll be just about done.
Dr. Bailey, Dr. Warren's calling the front desk.
He was wondering what time your surgery would be done.
Yeah, I bet he is.
He probably found another inspiration picture
in a bride magazine he wants to discuss.
Do we do silver bells or snowflakes
on our invitation?
Garland or poinsettias on the centerpiece?
Psh. Uh, suction.
It's just a wedding.
Oh, come on.
Out of all people, I thought
I could count on you to have my back.
Do you think I wanted that wedding at Meredith's house?
That was for Owen.
Put on the dress. There are bigger battles.
Right, 'cause that philosophy
worked out so well for you and Owen. T-tube.
Here you go.
Dr. Kepner?
Sorry, this P.D.S. suture isn't holding,
and I can't get hemostasis.
Horseback riding is supposed to be fun,
but even if you wear the right shoes,
and a helmet and everything, protection doesn't always work.
So you know what? What's the point?
You might as well just ride bareback.
Karev, can you take this over for a second?
Yeah, sure.
You, whatever your name is,
can you stop stalking me with chairs?
I-I'm stretching, which is normal.
W-we all need to stretch sometimes.
So can you just get that thing away from me?
Pickups.
Here you go.
You were right. It's a tumor.
Move.
But this neuro guy says it's too far along to operate,
so they're just gonna send him home.
She spent all these years
thinking he was just a dirty old man,
and now she knows it's a tumor
and that's not who he is, it's too late, and...
I'm talking to myself.
Dr. Yang, I'm almost finished here.
You can get ready to close the sternum.
Boki, I think Dr. Yang prefers sternal cables,
not monofilament wire.
Dr. Edwards, how would you like the honor
of closing for me today?
Uh, no. You heard me.
No interns closing up this patient.
Dr. Bailey, I might not give the best wedding advice,
but this is my intern under my service,
and she's been practicing this procedure for days.
I am more than confident she's prepared.
Fine. Let her close.
Prepare the sternal cable, please, Boki.
Dr. Bailey, should there be this much bleeding?
Oh, he's not clotting.
Uh, let's get some F.F.P. and factor vii up here.
Get in there with some lap pads.
We need to apply pressure quick.
All right, guys. Okay, let's make sure
that we check pulses every two hours.
I'm gonna go talk to the parents.
Everybody out.
I said get out.
You okay?
Robbins, are you hurt? Did you hit your head?
I was--I was so proud of myself...
for getting through today
and the surgery,
like nothing was different,
and I'm such a big shot
that I went and put all my weight on my left foot,
except...
I don't have a left foot.
And now I'm on my ass.
And you should--you should see the look on your face.
Oh, are you gonna-- are you gonna help me up?
Yeah. Come on.
Come on.
How's the bleeding?
Still won't stop.
Can we try more R.B.C.S?
That'll just overload him. What's his lactate level?
It's gone from 9 to 17 in the last 30 minutes.
No.
Oh, come on. No. No.
Oh, damn it.
What is it? Why'd you stop?
See how the liver's patchy?
He's rejecting it?
Does this mean I don't get to close?
Okay, so if we did a pedicle flap...
we could do a tendon transfer to get back motor function.
Where are you?
What?
You've been staring at your phone all day,
like some 16-year-old girl
waiting for a creepy college guy to text her back.
I need you to focus.
I'm sorry, okay?
But we both know Shepherd
is just gonna shoot this thing down.
He doesn't want to do the surgery.
Oh, he doesn't know what he wants. He's just scared.
He wishes this never happened, but it happened,
And now it's up to us to come up with a plan.
That makes him feel just a little less scared,
makes him believe it'll all be okay.
And we can do that. So come on.
Are you with me here?
I gotta go do something.
What?
Hey. What's up?
Look at this.
A mesio-orbital frontal lobe tumor.
He's the grabby guy.
He's a father.
His whole family's horrified to be around him.
I thought we could help him,
But Clemens says it's inoperable.
No, it's not.
I thought so.
All right, I'll page Clemens,
let him know that he's an idiot,
and walk him through how to do it.
Derek.
Yeah.
He's not gonna do as good a job as you.
No, he's not.
Which is why you have to get your hand fixed.
I don't-- I don't have the results yet.
I told you I would text you.
I'm in. All the way.
What?
Come on.
I know it might not be what you planned
or how you planned it,
But we can do this.
We'll get married, have an awesome kid,
be amazing parents.
I'm in.
Don't say that if you don't mean it.
I mean it. We can do this.
You really think that--
You said it yourself.
Something that feels this good cannot be bad.
So you-- you really want this?
I want this.
We get married.
We have a house. We get a big yard.
And we have a wedding?
We have a huge freaking wedding.
In a--in a field with butterflies.
I don't know. Butterflies, a field-- whatever you want.
Okay? Your family's gonna be there.
My family--I mean, my crazy mom's gonna be there.
She'll probably bring Webber.
Whatever. That's fine.
Oh, my gosh.
Are we really...
You sure?
We can do this?
We can do this.
How did you know?
11 years in your job.
Mm. You want it back?
No.
You know, they're usually looking for a scapegoat,
someone they can lay all the blame on
and then set 'em adrift.
That's what happened?
No, the board, they have my back...
Completely.
Well, that's great.
Yeah.
Why wouldn't the just... fire me?
I don't know.
What?
You're married to someone on the other side.
They seem unhappy about that?
Richard, thanks.
You said it was a perfect match.
It was.
Just... sometimes for reasons we don't always understand,
the body doesn't want to accept the new organ.
So what now? You--you...
You put him back on the transplant list?
Yeah. We made calls.
But given Graham's condition...
He needs this.
Look at him.
You can't tell me there are sicker people out there.
That's the point, bug. I'm sick.
Better they give it to someone who could make it last.
How long do I have?
Mm. A week, maybe.
That's good.
It's not 30 years.
But it's better than nothing.
I'm sorry.
Hey, you don't get to leave.
Come back here.
I'm old.
And I've had a good life.
I found people to love who loved me back.
You save your tears for someone who needs them.
I mean it. You did good.
We've got this week...
and we're gonna make it count.
Here we go.
"Not pregnant."
Oh, God.
Thank you, Jesus.
Now we don't have to get married.
We're free.
We just--we just dodged a bullet.
Like, the biggest bullet ever.
Thank you. Thank you, God. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
No.
No, J-Jackson, no, I didn't mean...
just, you know, now things don't have to change.
We could stay dating,
just not while also raising a child.
Everything can stay the same.
You know, I'll-- I'll just go on the pill
so I don't have to freak out every time that I... am late.
It's cool.
Seriously, don't bother.
What? Jack--Jackson--
Maybe this was a sign, you know?
that we needed to stop.
Honestly, I think it's for the best.
Okay. I-I mean, if that's what--
It is.
I gotta go, uh, check in on Torres.
I will see you later.
Okay.
Hey, weepy.
No big deal, but don't do that again.
It's gross.
Uh, sorry.
What?
You cared about him.
No, I didn't.
Oh, you did, just like you cared about that other intern,
so much you fought me to teach her.
Just like you cared about my wedding
enough to give me personal advice--
good advice--
that I'm actually planning to take.
So I don't know what happened to you
in that frozen hell of a tundra,
but you've changed.
I did not.
No. No, no, no, no. No. You're supposed to--
You're supposed to wait.
I'm coming up with a-a-another plan.
It's not like the others.
Oh, okay, great. Well, let's hear it.
No.
No, you're just--
you're gonna crap all over it.
I've been busting my ass for you on this
and making PowerPoints and--and--and losing sleep,
to talk to surgeons in Switzerland
when I should be talking to you.
You want to fix your hand? Then help me, damn it.
That came out a little stronger than I intended.
You're right. Okay? So here's what we're gonna do--
We're gonna throw out everything we have.
We're gonna get new studies.
We're gonna come at it from a different angle.
We're gonna clear our heads,
and then we are gonna figure it out.
So do we start right now?
Tomorrow.
You need to take the night off.
Thank you.
Oh, thank God.
Have I changed?
How?
How would he know that?
Who?
He says nothing has changed,
but what if I'm the thing that's changed,
but he won't friggin' talk to me?
Oh. I'm all caught up now.
Do you think I've changed?
Well, you want Owen back.
I don't.
Yeah, I want Owen back.
We've changed.
It's good.
Oh, Dr. Hunt. Is there something else?
Yeah, a question.
My conflict of interest here
doesn't seem to concern you too much.
Well, like we said, it's unusual for--
What about my wife's conflict of interest?
She's married to me, too.
Well, that--that's--
I booked the plane,
and my wife could benefit financially from my negligence.
You're hoping that because I'm married to Cristina,
the judge will throw this whole case out.
Whoa, Dr. Hunt.
Let's not overthink this.
The board supports you 100...
Let me just remind you that
the confidentiality agreement that you signed
is punishable by termination and financial penalties.
I understand.
Have a good night.
You... will be getting an invitation in the mail soon,
there will probably be elves on it.
You, however, will not be getting me a gift.
Are you telling me that if I get you a waffle maker,
you'll send it back?
I do like a waffle.
Well, it's gonna be fine.
You promise?
No. But I'll have your back either way.
I wouldn't be able to show up to work again.
It wasn't that bad.
It sounds pretty bad.
I cry during sex sometimes. It's not that bad.
You look like crap.
Yeah. That's about right.
Beer.
Sure.
So, uh... Kepner's knocked up?
I mean, she was acting a little weirder than usual,
you were taking her blood.
Here you go.
Well, not that it's any of your business,
but... no, she is not knocked up.
That sounds like something to drink to.
Can we get another round?
Coming up.
No more calling her weird.
She is.
Yeah, I know. Just...
You're not allowed to say it.
Can you dance? Can you show me your moves?
Hello.
Can you dance with me?
Wow. What's going on here?
Oh, we're having a little dance party.
So... I guess you had a good day?
Yeah, yeah. I fell down.
What? What happened?
I got back up.
Hey, um, I started dinner,
but then little Miss wanted my attention,
so do you mind finishing the salad?
Sure. Hi, baby.
Hi, mama. Hi, mama.
Do you want to dance?
You see my necklace?
Maybe I do believe it...
all this "Meant to be" stuff.
So... I talked to Clemens.
He referred the tumor patient
to somebody over at Seattle PRES.
Great. Uh, take a look at the shirt that I bought Zola.
It's--it's--it's in the bag on the counter.
Oh, Meredith, guys don't get all goo-goo over baby clothes.
Just look.
What is this?
Why not believe it, really?
Who doesn't want more romance in their life?
It's only three weeks
so I shouldn't even be telling you.
I mean, I still have a hostile uterus,
and terrible things are constantly happening to us,
which is why I haven't told anyone.
I haven't even told Cristina.
So... if you tell anyone, I-I swear,
I will kick you out of this house that you built.
Don't worry.
And good things happen to us.
We're gonna have another baby.
We are gonna have another baby.
Maybe it's just up to us to make it happen...
to show up and be meant for each other.
Thank you for coming.
We should talk.
We should.
At least that way, you'll find out for sure...
I think--
We should get a divorce.
That's what you want?
If you're meant to be...
Yeah.
or not.
