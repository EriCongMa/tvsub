meds .
approach the door .
swallow .
open your mouth .
have a nice day .
you , too .
lights out .
there he is , we got him .
seriously ? this is embarrassing .
here we go .
something better than a clown car ?
you couldn &apos;t have gotten something bigger ?
the guy shot our tires out , danny .
i didn &apos;t have time to go car shopping .
so i took what was available .
you got to ... wait .
all right , all right !
what the hell is the matter with you ?
relax .
relax ?
relax !
i &apos;m gonna die in a clown car .
you got no room on the right .
okay .
this is fab .
this is great . after all that now you &apos;re gonna lose him ?
okay .
can you please just keep two of the three wheels on the ground ?
how many times have i told you ,
you don &apos;t like the way i drive ,
you can get out of the car anytime .
i would love to get out of the car . there are no doors .
duck .
what ?
duck !
get out of the car .
out of the car , right now .
get on your knees . hands , hands up .
do it . now .
don &apos;t even think about it .
there &apos;s two ways this can go ,
and in both you end up dead .
you know , that doesn &apos;t make any sense .
but it sounded good , right ?
get on your knees . let &apos;s go .
duke lukela , meet henry dunbar ,
the serial bank robber you guys have been looking for for awhile now .
he &apos;s all yours .
get him out of here .
we got a problem .
wo fat &apos;s escaped .
oh , that &apos;s funny , you see ,
what i thought you said is that wo fat escaped ,
which would be impossible
because he &apos;s in a supermax in colorado
and everybody knows you can &apos;t escape from those places .
another myth bites the dust .
how ? what happened ?
wo fat was taking nitroglycerine for a heart condition
induced by the helo crash trauma that he suffered last year .
well , he was actually stashing most of the doses .
which he then cocktailed
with paint thinner and fertilizer that he picked up
from the prison yard to make an anfo bomb .
strong enough to blow a hole in his cell wall .
but i wouldn &apos;t put it past him that he had help .
aloha . wahine .
oh , samantha .
oh , look like you got stood up , brah .
oh , no , she &apos;ll be here .
one thing about my daughter samantha ,
she &apos;s ... sort of punctual .
well , if she doesn &apos;t show ,
and you need a hand with the shrimp plates ,
my cousin flippa ,
he got a lunch break coming up .
thanks , but , uh , she &apos;ll show .
just in case , i &apos;ll have him on standby .
howzit ?
little girl , where are you ?
daddy , i &apos;m sorry , i should have called earlier ,
but i can &apos;t make it to lunch .
what do you mean you can &apos;t make it ?
what &apos;s the matter ? everything all right ?
everything &apos;s fine .
i just need to finish my history assignment
and need to stay in the library a few more hours .
don &apos;t be angry .
i &apos;m not angry , sweetheart .
i &apos;m glad you got your priorities straight .
stop , i &apos;m on the phone .
samantha , where are you ?
i told you , i &apos;m in the library .
don &apos;t lie to me , samantha .
dad , i &apos;m not lying .
let me talk to him .
no . just give me a second .
samantha , who is that ?
just a friend i met in the library .
a friend you m ...
you know , you should really learn
to trust your daughter more .
boy , i don &apos;t know who you think you &apos;re talking to ...
look , i &apos;m just saying , all right ?
you got a good girl here .
she &apos;s awfully cute , too .
all right , who the hell is this ?
really ? you don &apos;t recognize my voice ?
i &apos;m seriously bummed , dude .
let me help you out .
you just need to stop this
and we &apos;ll try to make a deal .
a deal ?
i &apos;ve committed acts of treason , there won &apos;t be any deals .
where &apos;s the other computer , ian ?
put me on that plane or 300 people are gonna die .
let me talk to my daughter .
oh , whatever you say , pops .
daddy , what &apos;s going on ?
samantha , honey , i want you to listen to me very carefully .
the man that you &apos;re with is a very dangerous fugitive .
now , he &apos;s gonna want to hurt you ...
daddy , i &apos;m scared .
now @-@ now i know you &apos;re scared ,
but i need you to be strong .
i &apos;m gonna find you . i promise you .
i &apos;m gonna find you .
now you got her all freaked out . all right ?
that &apos;s not going to help this thing at all .
you little son of a bitch . what do you want ?
stay close to your phone , i &apos;ll be in touch .
and obviously , this stays between us .
tell any of your cop buddies about this ,
and you &apos;ll be using your daughter &apos;s college fund
to pay for a funeral .
no , please ... please ...
all right , all right .
okay .
hey , lou .
hello ?
after the beep , you know what to do .
what &apos;s up ?
went straight to voice mail .
i just got off the phone with the prison warden in colorado .
steve , you might want to sit down for this .
why ?
wo fat only had one visitor when he was over there ...
guess who it was ?
my mother .
she went to visit him twice in the last month .
i &apos;m going to sit down , actually .
were the visits recorded ?
no .
apparently the sit @-@ downs were sanctioned by someone in the dod
and they were ordered nonmonitored visits .
let me get this straight :
in the year that your mother &apos;s disappeared ,
she decides to go see this nut job instead of her own son .
you actually need this couch more than me .
why don &apos;t you sit down ?
this is all about wo fat &apos;s mother &apos;s grave in cambodia .
why do you say that ?
two visits in the last month ?
that &apos;s right on the heels of our trip to cambodia .
doris must have found out we went there
and discovered the truth .
i &apos;m telling you , she must have found out
that she killed his mother instead of his father .
and if that &apos;s true , maybe wo fat escaped to find him .
hey , guys , you need to see this .
got a positive id on wo fat from four hours ago .
this was taken at a gas station
near colorado springs .
the driver was doa at the hospital .
state patrol has set up check points ,
and the local pd are conducting a hard @-@ target search
of every residence in the area .
it &apos;s a waste of time .
wo fat &apos;s not sticking around . plus , he &apos;s got a car .
he &apos;s getting as far away from there as possible .
yes , governor .
yeah , i &apos;m on my way .
hey , honey .
how was lunch ?
it was good .
good .
so , did you have the conversation ?
well , yeah .
and ?
and i told her that if she didn &apos;t buckle down ,
she was going to end up going to summer school ,
and it wasn &apos;t up for negotiation .
how &apos;d she respond ?
well , how do you think she responded ?
she gave me the pouty face , and then i gave her the look ,
and believe me , she got the message .
see ?
you can be bad cop when you want to .
hey , are you feeling okay ?
you &apos;re a little clammy .
no , i &apos;m good . i &apos;m good .
listen , sweetheart , i got to take care of something .
let &apos;s talk later . okay .
all right !
okay , baby .
well , i love you .
love you , too .
lou , you got a visitor .
be there in a minute .
mcgarrett ?
what are you doing here ? your phone broke ?
that &apos;s funny , &apos; cause i was gonna ask you the same thing .
what are you talking about ?
well , you called me , then hung up on me .
it must have just been an ass @-@ dial .
must happen a lot with a guy your size .
as much as i &apos;d like to stand here
and let you take shots at me , i &apos;m kind of busy .
you okay ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine . why are you here ?
governor &apos;s put five @-@ o on a security detail .
i could use your help .
all right . what kind of help ?
we got a government transport flying in
to pick up a large amount of cash .
needs some swat backup .
well , sure , i can spare some guys .
thank you .
why don &apos;t you go ahead and take it ?
i &apos;ll , uh ... i &apos;ll text you the particulars .
all right .
yeah . hello ?
little slow on the pick @-@ up there , boss .
sorry . but i &apos;m here now . just tell me what you want .
okay , here &apos;s what you &apos;re gonna do .
you &apos;re gonna drive a fully @-@ loaded swat van
out to kahana bay
with six swat uniforms--
four large , two mediums .
all right , and throw in some of that nice , shiny tac gear , too .
weapons , extra ammo and credentials .
all right , hold on .
now , you listen to me .
i &apos;m not doing a thing until i talk to samantha .
it &apos;s your daddy .
daddy ?
i &apos;m here , suge .
i want to go home .
you will , i promise .
but until then , i need you to just hang in there for me .
you hear me ?
i need you to be strong .
is that good enough for you ?
kahana bay ?
you got one hour .
agent novak , what are we looking at here ?
one hundred million .
who does it belong to ?
it &apos;s ghost money .
confiscated assets from a drug cartel
that &apos;s being repurposed
to fund third world development .
ghost money . i don &apos;t speak spy . what is that ?
there might be a lot of people who hate this country ,
but nobody hates our cash .
$ 100 million .
that &apos;s a lot of diplomacy .
all right , we got wheels down on that transport in one hour .
where &apos;s your back @-@ up ?
i got swat posted outside .
good . brief them on the route .
in the meantime , i &apos;ll have my guys get this loaded .
roger that .
come on .
i got everything you wanted .
devoted father like you ,
i never doubted it for a second .
all right , ian , i did everything you asked me to do .
now , please ...
let samantha go now .
slow down , pops . we &apos;re not done yet .
what are you talking about ?
turn around .
you see that truck coming your way ?
what about it ?
you &apos;re going to give those men inside that vehicle
the uniforms , weapons and credentials .
and then what ?
then you &apos;re going to help them steal $ 100 million .
yeah , okay , just keep me posted .
mahalo .
what &apos;s up ?
wo fat is still in the wind .
why don &apos;t you call your mom , ask her where he is ?
you realize that hurts me when you say that ?
i @-@ i didn &apos;t mean to hurt you . i &apos;m sorry .
i was literally just trying to be helpful .
i mean , i know you can &apos;t even get in touch with her anyway .
she avoids you like crazy .
stop being helpful !
okay ?
okay .
sorry .
thank you .
well , uh , speaking of , uh , missing persons ,
you talk to catherine at all ?
you being genuine ?
yes .
okay , yes , i have , actually .
we texted last night .
she has a solid lead on najib &apos;s whereabouts ,
and she &apos;s headed to the hindu kush .
doesn &apos;t sound like she &apos;s coming back any time soon .
probably not till she finds that boy .
i &apos;m genuinely sorry . i know that that is tough .
thanks , man .
yeah , it &apos;s tough , but , uh ... but i get it .
catherine &apos;s been in the military half her life .
she &apos;s doing what she was trained to do .
she &apos;s not coming home until the job is done .
everything okay ? you &apos;ve been quiet all day .
adam brought up the m @-@ word last night .
what did you say ?
he didn &apos;t officially propose .
just wondering would i consider it .
and would you ?
i love him .
and i want to have a family with him .
i just don &apos;t know if i want it now .
you know , one of my biggest regret about malia
is that i didn &apos;t ask her to marry me sooner .
this life we live ...
it &apos;s unpredictable .
i say , if it feels right , there &apos;s no reason to wait .
anybody gonna tell me what the plan is ?
the plan is that you follow our lead and shut up .
then maybe you and your kid get to walk away .
okay .
so just to be clear ,
anything happens to my daughter , i &apos;m going to kill you .
then i &apos;m going to find everything you love ,
and i &apos;m gonna kill that , too .
load up . we got 20 minutes .
in case you get hungry .
don &apos;t go anywhere , princess .
bravo 158 , proceed to 2383 north king street .
reported burglary .
158 responding , 10 @-@ 4 .
sarge .
what &apos;s up ?
lock down baggage claim .
cut him off outside !
over here !
it &apos;s the backpack the kid was wearing .
notify the airport manager .
we may have a bomb threat .
all central units to honolulu international .
suspicious package found in terminal 3 rear baggage area .
airport evac and lockdown in progress .
this is swat , 10 @-@ 4 , proceeding .
eta , approximately three minutes .
everybody listen up .
there &apos;s been an incident in terminal 3 .
the airport is being evacuated .
we need to load that money right now
before the runways are shut down .
everybody maintain situational awareness ,
in case this is no coincidence .
copy that .
get your head right .
your daughter &apos;s life depends on it .
put your weapons down ! down ! down !
what the hell is going on ?
there &apos;s no bomb threat .
that &apos;s just a diversion to get at that truck .
story time &apos;s over . get their weapons .
i &apos;m sorry , steve . it &apos;s got to be this way .
where is it ?
what are you talking about ?
what am i talking about ?
where &apos;s the money ?
i don &apos;t know .
that money didn &apos;t just disappear !
so where is it !
you keep asking me the same question ,
it &apos;s the same answer : i don &apos;t know .
the last time we saw it , it was in this truck .
now , that &apos;s the truth .
hey , listen , we were briefing swat
when that money was getting loaded in that van .
novak had plenty of time to do something shady .
we wouldn &apos;t know about it , all right ?
you &apos;re lying .
and i &apos;m done asking !
you got three seconds to tell me where that money is .
one ... two ...
man , i &apos;m sorry-- they got my daughter .
who has your daughter ?
ian wright .
what ? !
that hacker kid who disappeared six months ago ?
that &apos;s right .
are you sure it &apos;s him ?
he sent this to me from my daughter &apos;s phone .
and that money is the only thing keeping my daughter alive !
that &apos;s him .
answer it .
i can &apos;t .
take the call-- buy yourself some time , okay ?
please ?
yeah ?
what happened ?
nothing happened .
i &apos;m getting your money just like you asked .
did i also tell you to kill the six guys i sent to help you ?
he can see us .
look , your guys panicked !
they got anxious , and things got out of hand .
shut up !
i don &apos;t care about them . where &apos;s my money ?
the money &apos;s not here .
okay , then where is it ?
how would i know that , ian ? i don &apos;t know !
you &apos;re seeing what i &apos;m seeing .
there is no money in the truck !
ian .
commander mcgarrett .
so nice to hear your voice again .
ian , let samantha go .
you want a hostage , come take me .
that is so gallant of you .
but no , thanks , i think i &apos;ll stick to my original plan .
besides , she &apos;s a lot cuter than you .
ian , listen to me , the money &apos;s gone .
it &apos;s all over .
it &apos;s over when i have my money .
so i suggest you find it .
i called novak three times ; he &apos;s not picking up .
we find novak , we find that money .
clear !
clear !
so he checked out without telling the front desk .
kono .
yeah , what do you got ?
novak rented a panel van two days ago .
he signed the paperwork using an alias
from his days as a dod operative .
panel van ?
plenty of room to stash a hundred million in a panel van .
yeah . but there &apos;s a silver lining ,
&apos;cause the rental car company has an anti @-@ theft device
on the truck , which i &apos;m activating now .
got it .
stay on pu &apos;uhale ,
take a left on auiki ,
then take a sharp left onto sand island access road .
make a left . make a left .
the vehicle is stationary .
address is 1610 .
kono , we got novak &apos;s van .
come on .
go .
it &apos;s not over .
it &apos;s not ? you see any money in there ?
because i don &apos;t !
and without that money ,
my daughter is just as good as dead !
oh , god , she &apos;s just a baby .
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m so sorry , samantha .
listen to me .
a few years ago , uh ,
this guy that i thought i knew , he took my daughter .
and , uh ... you know , i remember back then
thinking i got two choices now .
i can , uh , i can shut down ,
start mourning my daughter ,
or i could do anything and everything it took
to run over whatever stood in my way to get my daughter back .
i can &apos;t stop thinking about her .
i can &apos;t stop thinking about what she must be going through .
right now you need to put that on hold .
if you want to see samantha ,
you stay focused on ending this son of a bitch .
you understand ?
yeah .
let &apos;s go get this guy . come on .
yeah , let &apos;s get him . let &apos;s go .
here we go . this is every traffic cam in the area
that we found novak &apos;s van .
all right , let &apos;s rewind them .
novak had to have moved that pallet of money into another truck--
let &apos;s see if we can find it .
all right , i just spoke to novak &apos;s supervisor at the pentagon--
he hasn &apos;t checked in since he landed on the island .
he &apos;s too busy stealing all that cash .
i had his bank accounts frozen , and his family &apos;s under watch .
so , how does a lone dod bureaucrat from the mainland
physically move a hundred million dollars ?
he had to have help .
sorry , commander . he said you were expecting him .
you son of a bitch , come here .
where the hell is my daughter ?
are you asking me if she &apos;s alive , or where she is ?
because you know i &apos;m not gonna tell you that .
hey , hey , hey . samantha &apos;s alive , lou .
she &apos;s the only leverage he &apos;s got .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re the boss .
get up .
you still got it .
what are you doing here ?
you guys like the beatles ?
i do . my dad turned me on to them .
kind of primitive for my generation ,
but they got some good tunes .
what &apos;s that got to do with anything ?
john , paul , george , ringo .
arguably the best rock band in rock and roll history .
kind of like you guys , right ?
you &apos;re , like , the best cops in the world . five @-@ o.
but with the beatles , there was this guy ,
the power behind the throne , brian epstein ,
who , by all accounts , was the fifth beatle .
that &apos;s who i am today .
i &apos;m your brian epstein .
you better start making sense ,
or i &apos;m putting a hole in you .
i know where my money is .
where is it ?
the makuakane family has it .
how do you know that ?
well , when i realized novak used you as a diversion ,
i ran his name in a key search ,
got back a series of encrypted e @-@ mail exchanges
between him and members of the makuakane family .
who are these guys ?
local samoan cartel run by
inoke makuakane .
heavy in the ice trade .
everyone in his crew gets his wings in california ,
which is the equivalent of seal training for gangbangers .
that &apos;s got to be how novak &apos;s getting himself
and the money off the island ,
using their smuggling infrastructure .
the problem is , these guys have been on the radar for years ,
and no one &apos;s been able to touch them .
which is why i suggest you use all the collective brain power
in this room to figure it out .
because the clock is ticking .
oh , and by the way ,
i already jammed all the surveillance cameras in the area ,
so if you try to follow me some other way ,
you &apos;ll never find your daughter .
this is from the latest satellite pass
over the makuakane &apos; ohana compound .
there are ten @-@ foot walls around the entire perimeter ,
armed guards , cctv-- it &apos;s a fortress .
all right , do we know how many people are in there ?
several families , at least .
that &apos;s a lot of collateral .
well , how do we get in there ?
without making a lot of noise , we don &apos;t .
we can &apos;t get a warrant without probable cause .
besides , it would expose the kidnapping
and put samantha in a bad spot .
yeah . i &apos;ve had run @-@ ins with this family before ,
and if we go in hot ,
it &apos;s gonna get bloody .
i get it , it &apos;s risky .
look ...
none of you have to do this .
it &apos;s not your problem , it &apos;s my problem ,
it &apos;s my daughter .
i don &apos;t have any expectations of anybody here .
and if i have to , i &apos;ll just go in there alone .
no , are you kidding me ?
he loves this stuff . he lives for it .
the only way we do this is together .
this is private property .
yeah , i can see that .
what do you want ?
i need to speak to inoke .
not gonna happen .
my bad , brah .
i forgot to say please .
let &apos;s go .
hold it right there . let him go .
that &apos;s far enough . stop right there .
easy . easy .
i just want to talk to inoke .
you got any guns on you ?
no guns .
whoa , whoa , whoa ! that &apos;s a bomb !
come here .
you asked me if i had any guns .
get them out of here .
let &apos;s go !
come on ! let &apos;s get them inside !
okay , you got my attention .
what do you want ?
i want that money that he stole
that you &apos;re smuggling off the island .
i &apos;ve never seen this guy before in my life .
how &apos;d you know to come here ?
it &apos;s got nothing to do with you .
my daughter got snatched this morning .
i need that cash to buy her back .
and you &apos;re willing to kill yourself if i don &apos;t give it to you ?
she &apos;s my kid .
and she &apos;s gonna die if i don &apos;t bring that money back ,
so if i walk out of here without it ,
my life &apos;s over anyway .
it &apos;s your cash .
it &apos;s your call .
even if you give it back to him ,
i get my ten percent no matter what .
he &apos;s lying .
you think i &apos;d come in here and drop a story like that on you
and not be for real ?
i think i know a bluff when i see one .
this ain &apos;t no bluff , partner .
then come on . do it . take us out .
you don &apos;t think i &apos;ll do it ? !
then turn us all into puzzle pieces .
do it .
wood .
it &apos;s a fake . i told you .
make him disappear .
wait ...
drop your weapons !
you set us up .
just doing what i had to do .
i got a long memory , my friend .
that &apos;s good . we can hook up when you get out of jail .
now drop your weapons
before i have my friends ventilate your ass .
let &apos;s go get that money .
i got the cash .
show me .
hikina ranch . the old grass airstrip .
i &apos;ll give you 30 minutes .
once i take delivery and i feel safe ,
you &apos;ll get a call and i &apos;ll tell you where your daughter is .
i need proof of life .
sure . say hello to your daddy , princess !
talk to your father . he went through a lot of trouble for you .
daddy , i want to go home .
sweetheart , it &apos;s gonna be over soon ,
please , i want to go home .
all right ? i promise .
now you listen ,
you little son of a bitch ,
hikina ranch . 30 minutes .
i &apos;ll be there with the money .
of course you will .
see you soon .
no hard feelings ?
my dad is gonna find you , and he &apos;s going to kill you .
you know that , right ?
i like you .
go to hell .
one day .
but right now i &apos;ve got some serious cash to burn through .
aloha .
it &apos;s hard to believe this guy &apos;s just running late .
100 mil on the table , he &apos;ll show .
yeah .
what ?
say again ?
and you &apos;re sure ?
yeah , i got it .
samantha just walked into an hpd precinct .
and she said that ian wright is dead .
i got you . you &apos;re all right .
you &apos;re all right . you &apos;re all right now .
i told you ...
daddy always keeps his promises .
all right , look now .
i need you to be a big girl .
tell me now , what happened to ian ?
a man shot him .
it &apos;s all right . all right , baby .
what man ?
i don &apos;t know .
can i help you ?
what do you want ?
did he say anything to you ?
he wanted me to give you a message .
he said that you and he need to have a talk .
he &apos;s coming after you .
then let him .
this is grover .
yes , sir , governor . right away .
i &apos;m , uh , being called to the principal &apos;s office .
all right . i &apos;m going with you .
i can &apos;t let you do that .
this is on me .
well , listen , whatever happens in there ,
listen , man , i just want to say thank you
for having my back .
all of you .
all right , little mama , let &apos;s go .
hey . way to rock those lime green shorts .
you guys playing through
or you just , uh , fashion patrolling ?
oh , that &apos;s crazy , man .
you really look like you should be on a can of corn .
ho ho ho .
you got a sec ?
man , i ain &apos;t got nothing but time .
hey , how &apos;s samantha doing ?
well , she &apos;s up and down , you know .
she took some time off from school . we &apos;re keeping her close .
she needs ... she needs to be with her family right now .
how &apos;s forced retirement ?
well , the governor said that my actions were
a gross abuse of power by a sworn officer of the law
and my misuse of hpd resources was unprecedented .
so basically nothing i wouldn &apos;t have done
under the same circumstances .
you did what you had to do to get your daughter back
and that &apos;s that .
damn right . that &apos;s what i told the governor .
all right , so what &apos;s next ?
i &apos;m gonna smoke this cigar and , um ...
i don &apos;t know . maybe i &apos;ll play another 18 .
another 18 .
look , man , i love golf ,
but every day ?
i &apos;m a cop .
i &apos;ve been a cop for the last 30 years .
i don &apos;t know how to do nothing else .
well , that &apos;s good &apos; cause you don &apos;t need to .
what are you talking about ?
oh , come on .
we want you to join five @-@ o.
wow , man , i really appreciate that .
i mean it from the bottom of my heart , but let &apos;s be real .
