you set me up .
i &apos;m sorry .
i know it was you , daniel .
i &apos;m not going anywhere .
we can build a future together .
this is my future .
you &apos;re ending this with me .
i thought i could avenge my father &apos;s death by myself ,
but i can &apos;t . i need you to help me .
conrad is suing voulez for libel .
i &apos;m willing to drop my suit just as soon as you fire my son .
if you think we &apos;re gonna cave to your threats ,
you have ...
i &apos;ll do it .
jimmy brennan ? heard of him ?
if i &apos;m to believe what &apos;s in this police report ,
he may also go by &quot; dad . &quot;
what did jimmy brennan do to you ?
he kisses me , and i try to pull away .
and he pushes my face into the concrete .
i was expecting to see the former governor &apos;s wife .
i &apos;m the first mrs. grayson .
are you okay ?
since my head injury ,
i &apos;m getting a little dizzy sometimes .
you were marvelous last night , mrs. grayson .
of all the weapons we take into battle ,
there is none more powerful than the mind .
it holds our instincts and our training
and allows us to distinguish friend from foe ,
love from hate .
hold perfectly still , mrs. grayson .
but if that weapon is unsound ,
it is by no means disarmed .
for the mind is all the more dangerous when damaged .
and there &apos;s no guarantee
that it won &apos;t choose itself as its next victim .
physically , you &apos;ve recovered beyond expectation .
with regard to your head trauma ,
there are no permanent neurological problems evident .
however , there is a bit of swelling
between the frontal and the left temporal lobes .
would that explain
the pounding in my ears , the blackouts ?
i &apos;m not a neurologist , emily .
but the lab forwarded the results to one .
he &apos;ll have a better analysis for you tomorrow .
and until then , what do i do ? i ...
i could be a risk to myself , to others .
given your state of mind ,
maybe talking with someone would help .
at the least , it may help you remember what happened .
because you still can &apos;t recall anything , right ?
i &apos;m glad to see i am still welcome .
i thought you &apos;d have changed the locks by now .
well , i have more important things on my mind
than your departure , conrad .
as have i while i &apos;ve been staying at the southfork .
i can only imagine what you &apos;ve been up to .
aside from having our son fired for your amusement , i mean .
actually ...
i &apos;ve come to care about my new venture .
and , so that i may approach it with a clear mind ,
i wanted to pop by in anticipation of convening our attorneys
to cement our divorce tomorrow .
oh , i assume , as always , my house will be
the first thing you &apos;ll fight me over .
why infringe on the beautiful memories of our first divorce
by retreading the same duels during our second one ?
mrs. grayson ,
there &apos;s been a fire at the gallery .
i still don &apos;t think we should have let ourselves in .
ah , the realtor was late .
besides , i needed to check for security issues .
using break @-@ in skills i was unaware of .
oh , my account manager just quit .
that &apos;s the third person to leave
since they heard of conrad &apos;s maneuver .
do not say &quot; i told you so . &quot;
i &apos;m taking the wait @-@ and @-@ see approach .
that &apos;s what i did when conrad bought into the bar last year .
this is just to hurt daniel . not me .
all right , look .
no more conrad talk .
i don &apos;t want to bring in bad mojo right off the bat , &apos; cause ...
... i think this might be the place .
but you &apos;ve only seen two houses .
i know , but my dad said that when you &apos;re looking ,
the first one you like is the one you should buy .
though ...
are you sure you &apos;d want to live here ?
i know it &apos;s nowhere near what you &apos;re accustomed to .
i came here to start a new life
and to leave the one i &apos;d grown accustomed to in france far behind .
since it &apos;s my birthday tomorrow
and you probably forgot again ,
i decided i &apos;d just tell you what to get me .
okay , guilty as charged .
so you name it , and it &apos;s yours .
i was rejected from the design institute .
i thought i had a shot ,
but i guess they thought i lacked experience .
so i was hoping you could find something for me at voulez .
you want my job ?
&apos;cause it &apos;s available .
seems there &apos;s no end to dad &apos;s insecurity .
he got me fired and took my stake in the magazine .
i &apos;m so sorry , daniel .
at least use it to your advantage .
i guarantee he &apos;ll flex his sagging muscles to help you .
but you know what ?
i &apos;d rather spend my time
throwing you an epic birthday party .
you can &apos;t pull all that together in one day .
you deserve it , sis .
after all ,
seems pretty clear it &apos;s ...
me and you against the world .
what happened ?
i @-@ i came here last night to work ,
try to deal with what you told me , and i , uh ...
well , i @-@ i got so upset that i , uh ...
this is my fault . i &apos;m sorry .
no . no , no , no . it &apos;s my fault .
you should go , though , all right ? let me deal with this .
no . we &apos;re in this together .
somebody really did a number on this place , huh ?
i &apos;m jimmy brennan , the contractor you called .
i don &apos;t know how you heard about me .
it must &apos;ve been good , right ?
are those aiden &apos;s ?
where &apos;s he going ?
wherever he tells my jet to take him .
is he here ?
since i knew you were coming over ,
i told him to scram .
i ... didn &apos;t want to confuse an already confusing situation .
did you want to say goodbye to him ?
no . it &apos;s probably best this way ,
especially since i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m doing half the time .
which brings us to why you wanted
12 hours of southfork security @-@ cam footage .
okay .
here you are on the phone .
any idea who you were talking to ?
no .
well , i bet conrad does .
picks up in the hallway .
you go in .
conrad leaves .
at least he was a gentleman .
he didn &apos;t come back till 7 : 00 .
when i woke up .
what is going on with you , ems ?
blackouts ?
colluding with conrad ?
my c.a.t. scan showed swelling .
when that goes down , i &apos;m sure whatever this is will stop .
yeah , but is that what the doctor told you
or what you wanted to hear ?
she &apos;s sending my results to a specialist .
maybe you should talk to a therapist .
you know i can &apos;t risk telling a stranger the truth .
yeah , but isn &apos;t that a risk you &apos;re already taking ?
i have survived on my own this long .
trust me . i can handle it .
you sure about that ?
who do you know in los angeles ?
hello ?
emily ? stevie grayson .
it &apos;s nice to talk to you again .
yeah ?
i &apos;m in town , and i &apos;m ready to process your divorce .
i begged you to leave well enough alone .
yeah , that was before you told me what happened --
before you told me that you were forced to sacrifice me ,
move across the ocean to stay away from that guy .
and i spent my life building a world to escape what he did .
and now he is in our space .
i should never have told you what happened .
why ?
so i wouldn &apos;t find out what a monster he was ?
or that i &apos;m a child of rape ?
i &apos;m gonna kill him .
patrick .
please ... don &apos;t do anything .
if i lost you because of that man ...
you are the one good thing that came out of the worst time of my life .
it &apos;s why i hold you so dear .
now , i want you to fire that man now .
charlotte loves his music .
you really think you can get him ?
for daniel grayson , i &apos;ll clone him if i have to .
ah , there she is .
larissa , this is my wife , emily .
daniel &apos;s told me everything you &apos;ve been through .
you &apos;re lucky to have such a strong man by your side .
you have no idea .
oh , i might .
he &apos;s pulling out all the stops for this birthday party .
for charlotte ?
that &apos;s nice of you , daniel .
i do all i can for the people i love .
i &apos;m gonna go check out where the band should set up .
okay . all right .
i heard you , uh -- you didn &apos;t come home last night .
i &apos;m surprised you care ,
especially after you man @-@ handled me .
something i know you &apos;ll regret .
no , the only thing i &apos;ll regret is my marriage to you .
because publishing my memoirs in serial form
will only help to increase our circulation .
and with my pedigree , i can guarantee
that mr. lemarchal will see us as something far more
than a curiosity which lies an ocean away .
wouldn &apos;t you agree , margaux ?
i need to speak to conrad alone .
now .
you have no right holding a creative meeting without me .
oh , i can &apos;t help it if you &apos;re house hunting while i &apos;m settling in .
i run things around here .
and not my father , as you seem to be implying .
you are absolutely correct .
he controls an international media empire .
mm @-@ hmm , which is why you &apos;re wasting your time
hoping he &apos;ll care about this magazine .
or maybe you just don &apos;t know how to get his attention .
emily ?
yes .
stevie grayson . nice to meet you .
i thought it best that we meet someplace out of the way .
let &apos;s take a booth .
yeah .
i always like hiding out in this stowaway .
i knew we &apos;d get along great .
i used to come here years ago .
well , thank you for coming again .
you kidding ?
i &apos;ve handled over a thousand divorces .
nothing compares to a grayson man .
only they could get me to cross the country for a kindred spirit .
so , down to business .
do you want to stick with the terms you suggested
on the phone last night ?
well , um ,
now that you &apos;ve had the night to sleep on it , i , well --
i think i &apos;d rather get your opinion .
obviously ,
daniel cheating in your residence
is grounds for annulment -- slam dunk .
you know , i --
i don &apos;t know if i can go through with this .
daniel and i -- yes , we &apos;ve been having a hard time .
but ... maybe i &apos;m overreacting .
you know , i think we could -- we could work it out .
really ?
last night , you were convinced otherwise .
in fact , you went as far to say that
you were also in love with someone else .
no . it &apos;s just daniel .
you can tell me whatever you want .
that look in your eyes ... is a look of love ,
and not for the man you married .
i can &apos;t lose you .
not to my plan or to niko .
no , emily .
emily . you can &apos;t do this now .
what is wrong with you ? let go !
look , i have to go .
if you want to have a sensible conversation ...
i &apos;ll call you from london , but this isn &apos;t happening .
have you been told where we &apos;re going ?
what the hell are you doing , niko ?
avenging my father ,
like i said i would .
you didn &apos;t think i &apos;d find this ...
under your bed ?
speechless ?
that &apos;s funny , aiden .
because you knew exactly what to say
when you showed up in japan .
and when you tried to send me to russia
to kill someone for a crime you committed .
i can &apos;t believe i nursed
my father &apos;s murderer back to health .
i didn &apos;t murder him .
we fought like warriors . he attacked me , and i defended .
a death was inevitable .
i wanted to tell you , and one day , i would have .
but you had to help emily first .
that was the code your father taught us .
we go where we &apos;re needed .
oh , i &apos;m counting on it .
i left her a clue
just to see if she was really as good as he claimed .
and when she shows up here to save you ...
i &apos;m gonna kill her .
what ?
you took someone i love ...
on this spot .
you can watch while i do the same .
we &apos;ll tell him $ 5,000 a month in child support ,
another $ 5,000 in alimony , and --
know what ?
i am back tomorrow . just sit tight .
i should have known you were behind this , conrad .
so i assume emily &apos;s whole divorce story was a sham ?
oh , no . no . quite the contrary .
emily would be wise to rid herself of my son .
that said ... i am glad you &apos;ve come ,
especially as we &apos;re neighbors .
you &apos;re living in a hotel ?
yeah , while emily &apos;s chosen to
not follow through with her inevitable divorce ,
that hasn &apos;t stopped me from proceeding with my own .
and are you planning on treating victoria
as horribly as you did me ?
actually , that &apos;s why i &apos;m here .
you know , i regret the way i handled things back then
and would like this chance to make my sincere amends .
you know , i want you to read this .
i believe it makes ample restitution for my misdeeds ...
with the added benefit of giving victoria
her overdue comeuppance .
there was a period in my life
when i would have wanted nothing more .
but there &apos;s one problem .
i &apos;m happy now .
why don &apos;t you give that time ?
that always changes .
yeah , most of my crew &apos;s on another job .
but i couldn &apos;t pass up the chance
to slap grayson on my client list .
hey , you got the power cut ?
uh ... there you go . you &apos;re all safe .
so , you accidentally lit the blaze , huh ?
yeah , thanks for reminding me .
yeah , don &apos;t beat yourself up .
life &apos;s a bitch if you live with regret .
yeah , well , you seem like the kind of guy
who can just move past stuff .
are you kidding ?
there &apos;s a ton of crap i wish i had done differently .
like what ?
well , being a better husband .
being a better father to the boy i see
two days a month .
you , uh ... just got the one ?
yeah .
well , no , actually .
you want to talk regret --
back in the day when i lived in the bronx ,
i found out i had another one .
found out , huh ?
must have been living the single life .
hardly . i wanted to be with his mother .
but she basically hid the pregnancy from me .
just about killed me
when i saw her pushing that stroller down lexington .
really ?
i mean , how would you feel if you suddenly realized
that there &apos;s this part of you out there somewhere
that you never got to know ?
it &apos;s a damn shame .
yeah . yeah . i know .
i @-@ it is .
but you didn &apos;t hire me
to hear my life story .
it &apos;s just my long @-@ winded way of telling you
that i can get this all fixed up and no one &apos;s worse for the wear .
yeah , no . i guess you &apos;re right .
you know , sometimes it &apos;s better just to move past stuff .
and if i do my job right ,
you &apos;ll forget anything bad ever happened .
stevie grayson ?
if that &apos;s what you still call yourself .
it is , victoria .
how are you ?
well , it seems i &apos;m condemned to revisit
the horrors of my past , if you must know .
i &apos;m sorry you see me that way ,
especially since the last time we spoke ,
you were on my husband &apos;s arm .
i &apos;m surprised you remember that at all ,
considering your level of inebriation .
but before i &apos;m subjected to similar verbal assault ,
please excuse me -- it &apos;s my daughter &apos;s birthday .
oh , the one fathered by david clarke , right ?
you certainly have made paternity quite a hobby .
why are you here , stevie ?
for payback ?
because you still seem as out of sorts
as you were all those years ago .
you won , victoria .
isn &apos;t that enough ?
though i guess you &apos;re still trying to take
what i already have .
emily .
ems .
it happened again , didn &apos;t it ?
i got worried when i didn &apos;t hear from you .
it just never occurred to me that you &apos;d come home , i guess .
the question is , where were you before this ?
i , um ...
i remember being at the stowaway .
with conrad &apos;s first wife ?
emily , that was yesterday .
do you even remember what you talked about ?
apparently when i called her ,
not only did i ask for a divorce ,
but i almost told her about aiden .
so , blackout ems speaks the truth ?
i &apos;m aware of that , nolan .
and are you aware that you are living with the enemy
in a place where the truth could cost you your life ?
maybe your mind just wants to throw in the towel , ems .
ems !
# happy birthday to you #
# happy birthday to you #
# happy birthday to you , dear charlotte #
# happy birthday to you #
# make no mistake , these are animal urges #
# make no mistake , these are animal urges #
# make no mistake , make no mistake #
nolan , call me as soon as you get this .
well , daniel threw a beautiful party .
i can &apos;t believe charlotte &apos;s 19 .
a birthday brings to mind many things .
for a parent , it stirs up memories
of a day blessed by a miracle .
a joyful gift cherished for years to come .
sadly , it &apos;s an experience you &apos;ll never have ,
which makes me wonder --
who were your parents ?
where did you come from ?
and why are you still here ?
oh , i would be honored to help you find an internship .
the magazine needs more can @-@ do spirits .
thanks , dad . i &apos;ll make you proud .
a job at voulez ?
what a wonderful idea , charlotte .
and one i told you , like , 30 minutes ago ,
when you got here .
of course . sorry .
and at the risk of repeating myself ,
kudos to you
for taking my recommendation to call my ex @-@ wife .
have you spoken to her ?
i &apos;m just curious to hear how she reacted to your plan .
i remain optimistic .
you should know that if at any moment
you feel unsafe around my son again ,
i &apos;ve told them to keep that suite
at the southfork on reserve for you .
i &apos;m fine . but thank you , conrad .
all right .
really ?
okay , that &apos;s good to know .
thanks for the info .
please .
hear me out .
why would i want to listen to someone who fired me ?
your father forced my hand .
if he had moved forward with his lawsuit ,
the magazine would have folded .
i &apos;m trying to save it ...
for both of us .
yeah , well , both of us
are no longer there to fight for it , are we ?
that &apos;s why i wanted to see you .
what do you know of conrad &apos;s relationship to my father ?
probably the same as you .
a while back , your dad had some investments at grayson global .
but they haven &apos;t been in touch in years .
then what would he want with pascal &apos;s attention now ?
i don &apos;t know .
but he &apos;s certainly forming a lot of new partnerships .
one in particular i plan to get to the bottom of .
keep in touch .
very nice .
you gonna live there ?
i want to be , yeah .
charlotte , your friends were asking for you on the veranda .
oh . nice meeting you , mr. brennan .
and a happy birthday to you .
you &apos;re the spitting image of your mom .
i @-@ i didn &apos;t mean to crash your party .
i just need your approval on these paint chips your son selected .
well , i &apos;m afraid that he and i are going to have to discuss his choices .
no problem . it can wait .
i ... couldn &apos;t help but notice
you staring at me just like that in the gallery .
i beg your pardon ?
it &apos;s time to open presents !
well , it took me till now to pick up on it .
come on , everyone !
i understand . i mean , you &apos;re the ex @-@ governor &apos;s wife .
you have to keep up appearances .
i respect that .
you &apos;re mistaken , mr. brennan .
maybe i am .
but i don &apos;t think so .
excuse me .
i have guests to attend to .
go .
make your little girl &apos;s dreams come true .
good night .
put it away .
calm down . talk to me .
always hiding behind technology ,
afraid that everyone will find out what a freak you really are .
i said put it away !
and that &apos;s when you hulked out on my cell .
i hope that &apos;s the only thing i broke .
other than my ego ?
look , thankfully ,
my phone bore the brunt of your wrath
because you made it terrifyingly clear
that you did not want to be followed
when i tried to stop you from going back into the lion &apos;s den .
i &apos;m so sorry , nolan .
i can &apos;t believe i said those things to you .
i can handle it .
what i can &apos;t handle is you flying without a net .
i mean , do you even know what conrad &apos;s master plan is ?
not yet .
oh , god , i wish i could just
keep you locked up here until the full moon passes .
i do have my guest room back .
aiden certainly left enough crap here .
you think he would &apos;ve mastered the art of packing at this point .
though my pilot said he never showed up , so ...
i don &apos;t know . you think maybe he &apos;s coming back for it ?
was this in his room ?
yeah . why ?
it goes with takeda &apos;s sword .
i was the only one who had this .
you do things that aren &apos;t you during these blackouts .
what if you planted it for niko to find ?
and if she did , she knows that aiden killed her father .
i got to go .
aiden .
okay .
i &apos;m gonna get you out of here .
i knew you &apos;d come .
let him go , niko .
not gonna happen .
he &apos;s guilty of too many things .
like killing my father ,
lying to me about it ,
choosing a failure over me .
you &apos;re out of your league .
you &apos;re out of practice ,
even if we were both trained by the same great man .
but only one of us was his favorite .
emily , no !
she doesn &apos;t deserve to die .
emily . no .
you have every right to want to see me dead ,
but killing me or emily won &apos;t give you the peace you &apos;re after .
i loved you ...
and you betrayed me
and my father .
no .
your father died by his own code .
don &apos;t let the same happen to you .
please , niko .
go .
can i get you anything else ?
once upon a time , you all made the best sidecars .
which means you knew my father .
mm @-@ hmm .
well , those were his specialty .
so , i can &apos;t promise that i &apos;ve got his skills ,
but i &apos;m happy to try for a loyal customer .
i &apos;m fine , thanks .
i just wanted to stop by for old times &apos; sake before leaving town .
okay .
is that your boy ?
yeah . it &apos;s carl .
named for my dad , actually .
great smile .
stevie grayson .
jack ... porter , obviously .
so you &apos;re conrad &apos;s first wife , huh ?
we all make mistakes , right ?
at least you were smart enough to leave him behind .
spoken like someone who knows him .
i wish i didn &apos;t .
he &apos;s just caused a lot of problems for my family .
how so ?
it &apos;s long story .
i &apos;ll save it for next time you &apos;re in town .
looks like it &apos;s time to get the little man to bed .
all right . come on .
bye , carl !
thanks so much .
sure . no problem .
it was nice to meet you , stevie .
you , too , jack .
rachel , it &apos;s me .
cancel my flight back to l.a.
and get me conrad grayson &apos;s cell number .
you deliberately defied me !
continuing to employ that man ,
after i specifically asked you to fire him ? !
i know what you told me , all right ? i couldn &apos;t do it .
you have to do it .
no , actually , i don &apos;t have to .
and after listening to him , uh --
maybe he &apos;s not a monster anymore , okay ? he &apos;s got regrets .
he &apos;s got things in life he wishes he had done differently .
why are you choosing to hurt me in this way ?
i &apos;m not , mom . i &apos;m --
i &apos;m choosing to get to know him a little better .
there is nothing left to know .
he came to my home this evening -- my house .
he made advances toward me .
and i saw in him the same heinous man
who drew me in all those years ago .
it is me who &apos;s suffering , patrick . not him , like you wanted .
like you wanted ?
forgot my tool belt .
look , jimmy , we -- we should talk .
it &apos;s a little too late for that .
i can &apos;t believe i didn &apos;t figure it out sooner .
vicky harper .
been a long time .
and you must be the kid that she stole from me .
quite the happy family reunion , huh ?
hey , kid .
did your dear mom ever mention to you
how she used me back then ?
how she took advantage of my help
to get what she needed out of life .
and how did she thank me ?
by giving you away .
i was 15 years old ,
and i was looking for someone to trust ,
and you preyed on that .
you raped me .
you knocked on my door that night . we had a drink . we hung out .
you said you were feeling adventurous
that you wanted me down in that basement .
oh , you bastard !
don &apos;t you dare walk away from me .
no ! keep your hands off me !
get your hands off her !
oh , my god .
oh , god .
we need to call an ambulance .
and he pushes my face into the cold concrete ,
and he whispers , &quot; relax , honey . &quot;
relax , honey .
help me .
relax , honey .
i &apos;m fine , emily . you can go .
aiden .
i don &apos;t want to hear it .
i guess i should be thanking you for saving my life ...
but i wouldn &apos;t have been in jeopardy
if you hadn &apos;t have planted that sword .
do you hate me that much ?
of course i don &apos;t .
then why do it ?
i don &apos;t know .
but what i did ...
that wasn &apos;t me .
i &apos;ve been blacking out .
are you seriously gonna blame this on some kind of mental break ?
you think i wanted you dead ? !
it &apos;s like whatever ... state i was in ,
i could see our reality .
i &apos;m never gonna give up my plan .
i can &apos;t give you a family ,
a normal life .
so ...
i don &apos;t know . maybe i was trying to push you away .
so why show up yesterday and throw yourself at me ,
looking for some kind of reconciliation ?
or is that news to you , too ?
and just so you know ...
i never needed any of those things .
i just needed you .
but you never gave me a choice , emily .
get help ...
before you do something else you &apos;ll regret .
my party was a blast , daniel .
sadly , no potential boyfriends ,
but , still , thank you .
stay single , charlotte .
life &apos;s far easier that way .
i think emily &apos;s out to get me .
a bellhop at the southfork told me
that she and dad are working together on something .
why would she trust him when his mistress shot her ?
i &apos;m not sure .
but , uh ...
they got close when he thought he was dying .
and -- and you know he always wanted me to marry emily .
listen , i need you to help me with something .
what do you want me to do ?
voulez is dad &apos;s new base of operations .
okay ? now that you &apos;re working there ,
find out all you can about what he &apos;s up to .
all right ? like i said , it &apos;s just you and me now .
the police called with an update .
the coroner said that jimmy died from massive blood loss
following a fall from his ladder .
he ruled it an accident .
right , it &apos;s ... an accident .
we &apos;re not guilty of anything , patrick .
what you did , you did to protect me .
yeah .
but still ...
standing there tonight , watching my father die ...
what is wrong with us ?
we &apos;re victims of our world .
of men like jimmy brennan .
but this dark chapter in our lives is finally over ,
and we can move on .
i don &apos;t know if i can .
please sign it as you agreed .
i &apos;ve had a long night and would like some solitude in my home .
well , there may be a slight wrinkle .
what game are you playing now ?
sorry i &apos;m late , conrad .
how low you must have stooped
to put this one on your legal team .
oh , she &apos;s not joining my legal team .
she &apos;s merely here to impart some pertinent information .
copies of the grayson manor property deed .
it turns out that the land was actually purchased by conrad
before our divorce was final .
and while i may not have gotten much money in the split ,
i did get all undeveloped real @-@ estate holdings .
this house belongs to me .
and i will fight you until my last breath .
let &apos;s hope that &apos;s sooner rather than later .
but until then , i own this place .
and want you out by the end of the week .
homeless ...
at your age , victoria , what a pity .
and you .
you &apos;re an idiot if you think this makes us partners .
you wreak havoc in the lives of others ,
and that is about to catch up to you .
doctor &apos;s still out on your psychosis ?
she called .
the anomaly in my scan isn &apos;t causing the blackouts .
well ... i &apos;ve been worried sick about you .
and then , uh ...
something occurred to me about your past .
someone , actually .
nolan ...
look , you have to face the possibility .
i know .
my mother .
she was your age when
she had her first break , wasn &apos;t she ?
when she tried to drown me .
if nothing ever worked for her ...
what hope is there for me ?
don &apos;t do that to yourself .
there are people here to help .
who i &apos;m driving away .
i lashed out at you . i jeopardized aiden &apos;s life .
i &apos;m starting to go after the wrong people , nolan .
what am i gonna do ?
okay .
great , thanks .
i just need the loan approved ,
and then i can make the offer on the house .
what ?
the guy says i should have it in a couple days .
oh , but then i won &apos;t be here to celebrate with you .
i know .
i &apos;ll bring you something for the house back from paris .
you sure you know what you &apos;re doing ?
i have to force my father to see me .
that &apos;s the only way he &apos;ll hear me about conrad .
all right .
i &apos;ll call you when i land .
okay .
bye .
bye .
you can &apos;t get enough of the old place , can you ?
i &apos;d actually like to hear
the stories you alluded to last night .
about conrad ?
it &apos;s not really any of your business .
actually , it is .
why ?
because , jack ...
i &apos;m your mother .
