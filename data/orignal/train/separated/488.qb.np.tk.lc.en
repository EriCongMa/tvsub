i &apos;ll do whatever you want .
please ...
please ...
no , please ! no ! no !
this again ?
you miss another flight to see james ?
worse . he came here .
he &apos;s cooking and watching &quot; house hunters &quot; without me .
you know , he &apos;d better not try to make an offer again .
so , we get henry to bed ,
and , you know , we &apos;re about to finally have some alone time
with mommy and daddy , and ...
you guys know the rest .
ah , trying to dust off the old cobwebs .
inappropriate .
what ?
seriously , though , how long has it been ?
too long .
do we know what the case is ?
not yet . hotch just said to drop everything and get back here .
you need some private adult time .
i &apos;ll watch henry . no bad guys , no kids , in that order .
go to mexico . or the maldives , maybe .
cruz ?
yes ! exactly . a cruise would be perfect .
no , no , no . matt cruz .
let &apos;s get started .
thanks for taking this case , aaron .
you guys are on quite a streak .
it had been so long since i &apos;d heard from you ,
i wasn &apos;t sure if you were getting my reports .
i was putting out other fires in the bureau .
domestic terrorism needs my full attention .
but when it comes to you guys ,
why mess with success ?
how are those ribs ?
it still hurts when i laugh . you ?
the scars impress the ladies .
i hope you don &apos;t mind , ms. garcia ,
if i took the liberty
of having the much less talented version of you in my office
load the case details .
oh . yeah . sure , no problem .
a good friend of mine , sheriff peter coleman ,
down in briscoe county , texas ,
reached out to me about a possible case .
he &apos;s a former texas ranger ,
he &apos;s a good guy .
he read about our work on the silencer case two years ago .
he asked for a consult .
what do we have ?
abigail jones . prostitute .
she was found in a dumpster last night .
what &apos;s that on her wrists ?
it &apos;s , uh ... it &apos;s ... it &apos;s ...
uh , would you mind ?
thank you , jesus , buddha , and allah .
i like to cover my bases . you have to squeeze it .
rope burns .
which goes hand in hand with lacerations on her back .
there &apos;s also a gunshot wound to the back of her head ,
execution style .
it &apos;s a conflict in m.o.
the cutting and restraints points to sexual sadism ,
but the gunshot wound ends the torture too quickly for a sadist .
is that the only victim ?
there &apos;s hannah kelly ,
another prostitute , killed 6 months ago ,
dumped one jurisdiction over .
forensic countermeasure .
smart enough to separate the victims
so we won &apos;t tie them together .
and practical , too . the body was left in hooker row ,
where they pick up their johns ,
which brings us to our first victim ,
lucas wagner .
killed 11 months ago .
multiple arrests for soliciting a prostitute .
he was found outside of a crack house
where some of them lived .
he takes a paying customer and drops them where the girls live .
that sends a message that nobody &apos;s safe .
tell sheriff coleman we &apos;re on our way .
first they get hannah and now they get abigail ?
i don &apos;t want to go out tonight .
look , i &apos;ll come and look out for you .
you &apos;ll be ok .
watching us geting in a car isn &apos;t gonna help .
what if some man jams the doors and takes us out far and ...
wait , you think it &apos;s some serial killer ?
honey , we ain &apos;t got serial killers around here .
abigail did her own thing .
you all know that .
who knows who she knew ?
well , i ain &apos;t goin &apos; out there until this cools down .
no . no , mama &apos;s gotta eat , girl .
couldn &apos;t mama fast for one night ?
are my ears hearing me right ?
you want to tell that to the man upstairs , honey ?
please , dinah--
let me tell you how this works .
you &apos;re gonna go out there and shake that moneymaker .
and if you come back here with less than 200 ...
it ain &apos;t the bogeyman you &apos;ll have to be worried about .
you hear me , sugar ?
you &apos;re working the day shift , too .
chop @-@ chop .
hi , ben .
you ok , tabitha ?
why won &apos;t whoever &apos;s doing this just kill her ?
don &apos;t say that , tab . we &apos;ll be all right .
we always are .
did she pull your hair ?
&quot; the name written on her forehead was a mystery :
&quot; &apos; babylon the great , the mother of prostitutes
and of the abominations of the earth . &apos; &quot;
revelation 17 : 5 .
ballistics matched one gun to all 3 shootings .
so , the same unsub killed one john and two prostitutes .
at least he keeps it in the family .
maybe the john &apos;s a friend of the unsub ,
someone he picked up prostitutes with .
well , once he kills his friend ,
it makes it easier to kill the prostitutes .
that would explain why there &apos;s no sexual assault on the victims .
it &apos;s not about rape for this unsub , it &apos;s about torture .
i mean , that fits , kind of ,
but it just feels like we &apos;re missing something .
what we &apos;re missing is whether this guy &apos;s a sadist or not .
a gunshot to the back of the head throws everything off .
we &apos;re presuming he &apos;s using the gun to end things ,
but it could be part of the psychological torture .
i &apos;m gonna cut you , and if you flinch , bang .
ok , so let &apos;s go with that for a second .
there were 5 cuts on lucas wagner ,
9 on hannah , 12 on abigail .
he &apos;s escalating his torture . sadists definitely do that .
and they get deeper with each victim .
that &apos;s right . the first cuts were experimental in nature ,
and the latter ones were about maximum infliction of pain .
what if this is vigilantism ?
he &apos;s punishing these women and their johns
to clean up the streets .
but why take so long to do it ?
3 victims in 11 months ?
that &apos;s a substantial cooling @-@ off period .
morgan , you and reid talk to anyone
walking the streets last night
and see if they saw something useful .
dave and blake , go to the coroner &apos;s office ,
see what you can learn there ,
and jj and i will go to the station with the sheriff
and start interviewing friends and family .
how do you know matt cruz , sheriff ?
he and i worked a few cases
when he was working out of the dallas field office .
so which serial killers that you guys caught
was the scariest ?
vicky .
it &apos;s ok .
cases involving kids are the toughest .
oh . oh , sure . of course .
where would you like us to set up ?
right here . and we got the boards right over here .
oh , that &apos;s--that &apos;s full .
well , the whole force wanted to work on it .
we &apos;ve had bad people down here ,
but we &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
but we &apos;ll be following your lead on this one .
you have our best men , agent hotchner .
how can we help ?
have any of the family members come in yet ?
uh , carrie lawson , abigail &apos;s sister .
i told her to come at noon , but she got here at 8 : 00 .
hasn &apos;t budged for hours .
not even to go to the bathroom .
i &apos;ll talk to her .
oh , can i sit in ? i won &apos;t say a word .
um , you know , it might be more comfortable for her
if it &apos;s just one on one .
let me show you to the interview room .
she &apos;s enthusiastic .
but she means well .
of course . they all do .
i &apos;ve only been sheriff here a year ,
but it &apos;s the biggest case we &apos;ve ever had .
let &apos;s get to work .
you bet .
not too many spots for working girls to go to ,
so this &apos;ll be your best shot .
and you turn a blind eye to what goes on in here ?
agent , we only got one bar around here .
monday night &apos;s karaoke , tuesday &apos;s line dancing ,
and the girls are discreet .
can &apos;t hardly tell the professionals from the locals
who just want to get their drink on .
not to mention , we shut this place down , then what ?
the devil you know kind of thing .
exactly .
deputy .
dinah , these two are agents from the fbi .
you mind answering some questions ?
don &apos;t know much , but sure .
we &apos;re trying to find out more about a woman
named abigail jones .
did you know her ?
why you all asking about abby ?
when was the last time you saw her ?
last week . same bat time , same bat station .
she &apos;s all right , ain &apos;t she ?
no . she was killed a couple of nights ago .
killed ?
god almighty .
how well did you know her ?
used to flirt .
you know . she always said i couldn &apos;t handle her .
she was right .
so i &apos;d buy her drinks . she liked when i buy her drinks .
was she that kind of girl ?
party girl , maybe ?
it was hard to tell when she was loaded or not .
i mean , she was always off .
like she had her own song goin &apos; on in her head .
mack the knife .
let me ask you , did abigail come in often ?
was she a regular customer ?
what was that ?
mack the knife .
was that the song in her head ?
no . it was the name of her last ... date .
you know what i mean ?
yes , i do .
have you ever met this mack the knife ?
no .
she told me about him ,
said he was a good tipper .
do you know where we could talk to him ?
would you prefer to chat privately ?
i can &apos;t .
why don &apos;t we just have a little chat ,
right here .
you don &apos;t have to look at me .
don &apos;t move your head . just keep looking down .
just doing my best to be charming , if you don &apos;t mind .
could you lean over
and take this card from me ?
see ? i &apos;m not so bad .
come on , we &apos;re just talkin &apos; it up , havin &apos; some fun , right ?
why don &apos;t you flash me that pretty little smile of yours .
and then maybe slap me on the shoulder
like maybe i &apos;m trying to get fresh or something , huh ?
no ? yeah ? yeah .
dirty boy .
you wish .
all right , well , you can &apos;t blame a guy for trying .
nice to meet you .
one last question .
do either of these two people look familiar to you ?
the boy looks familiar .
the girl i never seen .
well , thank you for your time .
would you mind if we came back a little later ?
oh , anytime . got nothin &apos; to hide .
thanks .
sorry i couldn &apos;t help you none .
you told the police you spoke to abby
the night before she died .
she called out of the blue ,
so i knew something was up .
you two didn &apos;t talk regularly ?
we had ...
different lives .
i went to church ,
married the guy i went to prom with , had a kid .
and she ...
did what she did .
and what did she call about two nights ago ?
it was hard to follow her .
she was high .
and when she got high , she got paranoid .
about what ?
cameras in the light sockets ,
black helicopters following her .
those are common drug @-@ induced delusions .
i know . but ...
she did something different on the last call .
she apologized .
for what ?
everything .
every mistake she ever made ,
every sleepless night that she put my parents through .
and she said she had to say these things
because this was her last ...
this was her last chance to set things right ,
because they were comin &apos; to get her .
we got one of the names of her clients ,
mack the knife .
considering everything that happened to her ,
did she mention--
no . uh @-@ uh .
it wasn &apos;t &quot; he &apos;s &quot; coming to get me ,
it &apos;s &quot; they &quot; were coming to get me .
could we be looking at a team doing this ?
the signature of the cutting is too specific .
and nothing about the crime scene indicates a partner .
there is a fear plaguing this community ,
seeping into their souls , making them meek .
well , aren &apos;t the meek inheriting the earth , preacher ?
yes , but not until their time .
agent jareau , ssa hotchner ,
i &apos;d like you to meet preacher mills .
he runs the local--
ministry .
if you &apos;re in town long ,
you should come hear his word .
oh , thank you .
preacher has some information that he thinks
might help the case .
it &apos;s about lucas wagner , the male victim .
my congregation started as a thought , or--
or rather a dream .
i imagined a place where everyone could come
to hear the truth without being judged ,
and i--i didn &apos;t care whether you subscribed
to the old testament or the new testament .
all that i required was that there was love in your heart .
that &apos;s noble .
look , i neither judge nor devalue .
i embrace . and when i hug my flock ...
they whisper .
what do they whisper ?
secrets . they tell me about the things
that are rotting their souls .
the affairs they &apos;ve had , the money they &apos;ve stolen ,
the lascivious thoughts that permeate their sick minds .
did lucas wagner have secrets ?
yes .
and it weighs heavily on my heart .
see , his daddy lost his job .
his mama took gravely ill .
so in order to help out ,
he took to the streets ...
with the other girls , so to speak .
lucas was a male prostitute .
and he didn &apos;t discriminate with his clientele .
then why was he arrested for solicitation ?
the judge liked his parents .
he wanted to save them the embarrassment .
you see , we walk through life pretending to be one thing
when we &apos;re really another .
and like the opposing sides , truth is a magnet
and it sticks to you .
there &apos;s no steering clear of his law .
have you by any chance heard a whisper
about mack the knife ?
no , that name means nothing to me .
ok . well , thank you . that info is very helpful .
you know , i had to counsel lucas &apos; mother .
she felt terrible guilt about his death ,
and she said his wounds ran very deep .
indeed , they did .
can you tell me what they look like ?
only that they were very deep .
if you hear anything that may pertain to the case ,
we &apos;d appreciate it if you &apos;d let us know .
of course .
if we can &apos;t find the answers , trust me ...
he will .
look , if we get any breaks , i promise i will call you .
preacher .
carrie .
i heard what happened .
if you need to talk , my door &apos;s always open .
god bless .
god bless .
the cuts on the back run underneath the scapula .
what kind of knife did he use ?
sharp one .
well , we &apos;ve ruled out rape ,
but you still needed to run a rape kit on her .
why didn &apos;t you ?
she was a hooker . this was easy math .
well , how about this ?
if this were torture ,
the victim would be flailing about .
you &apos;d see a jagged cutting pattern as a result .
so ?
the marks on abigail jones are clean .
how do you account for that ?
drugs .
well , did you find drugs in the autopsy or tox screen ?
oh , i didn &apos;t order any of that .
why not ?
c.o.d. was a gunshot wound to the head . hello .
doctor , where did you go to medical school ?
oh , i ain &apos;t a doctor . i was elected to this position .
democracy in action .
you know , i call up m.e.s when i need them .
well , then , uh , why don &apos;t you call up the bodies , then ,
of hannah kelly and lucas wagner for us .
you want to dig up those bodies ?
why ? i &apos;m gonna need a reason
if i &apos;m gonna submit the request .
we need to do the work you didn &apos;t do
in the first place to confirm our theory .
now that we know that lucas wagner was a male prostitute ,
the unsub &apos;s m.o. makes more sense .
this probably wasn &apos;t torture .
then what was it ?
it was consensual s &amp; m that ended with a gunshot .
yeah , i &apos;m all good .
tired . you ?
well , dinah &apos;s been paid in full ,
which means the man upstairs is happy .
so ...
all right , belinda . we &apos;ll talk tomorrow , ok ?
i am beautiful .
i am beautiful .
i am ...
i am ...
all right , guys ,
i &apos;ll cut the binds
and then we can let her down carefully .
on three .
one ... two ...
whoa , whoa , whoa ! what are you doing ? !
do not disturb the crime scene .
well , we took a bunch of pictures just like you ordered us to .
i ordered you not to touch a damn thing .
we need to look at this crime scene undisturbed .
do you mind not standing there ?
thanks .
he &apos;s escalated his cuts .
they &apos;re not only bigger--
cutting was done postmortem . it was the gunshot that killed her .
how can you tell ?
based on the lack of blood flow and scar tissue .
if she were alive when this was done ,
there would be a lot more blood on her back .
which means this wasn &apos;t s &amp; m.
this was symbolic .
symbolic of what ?
we &apos;re not sure .
can you smell that ?
lavender .
that doesn &apos;t grow in these parts .
it &apos;s mainly around her legs .
why would he do that ?
reid , can you look into it ?
we can &apos;t trust the coroner to follow through .
yeah .
we need to deliver the profile .
i just don &apos;t understand why this has happened .
you have to trust .
how can i trust ?
she was my sister and now she &apos;s dead .
abigail is in a safe place now .
how do you know that ?
if it &apos;s so safe , why aren &apos;t any of us in a hurry to get there ?
i understand your doubts , but we must have faith .
i know that this is just a path that we &apos;re on ,
a spiritual journey in a physical form ,
and just because your sister isn &apos;t with us
doesn &apos;t mean she isn &apos;t among us .
they &apos;re coming for me !
they &apos;re coming for me !
are you ok , dear ?
no , i see them .
i saw someone watching me last night .
who ?
they .
them .
they tied her to a tree , and--
who ? who you talking about ?
tabitha . they killed her ,
and now all of the streets are blocked off .
is this armageddon ?
i don &apos;t want to die .
you &apos;re not gonna die . you &apos;re gonna stay in my office
where you &apos;ll be safe from his evil wrath .
where are you going , preacher ?
well , i &apos;m going to go to the police .
they need to know this monster is still out there .
and we need to know what they &apos;re gonna do about it .
come with me , child .
we believe the unsub we &apos;re looking for
is a white male in his early 30s .
while his m.o. is that of a sadist ,
we think there &apos;s an underlying pathology
of what we call a wound collector .
what &apos;s that ?
a wound collector is someone who uses
a lifetime of sleights , grievances , and wrongs
as justification for violence .
examples can be as large @-@ scale as hitler
scapegoating the jews for the holocaust .
or as common as an abusive husband blaming his wife
as an excuse to beat her .
this unsub is low key , almost submissive in public .
he has to be to attract the prostitutes .
but his real nature will be revealed in the safety of isolation .
this is the type of man
who would anonymously express himself online
by raging against how these
women are filled with disease and filth ,
how they deserve what &apos;s coming to them ,
probably to cover for the rejection
of a woman or spouse who &apos;s wronged him .
which means the unsub probably has a working @-@ class
or part @-@ time job .
it gives him the time to plan and execute the murders .
he &apos;s strong and good with his hands
and probably drives a work truck or large vehicle .
this allows him to move the bodies
and carry to tools for posing his victims .
tabitha ryerson tells us he &apos;s losing control .
he killed her in her home
and then transported her body to the woods
so he could mutilate her postmortem .
the public nature of the display was a message .
to who ?
to us .
this is a small town
and he knows the fbi is here investigating his crimes .
he thinks he showing us that he &apos;s smarter than we are .
he &apos;s also showing us his wounds .
there &apos;s part of him that wants us to stop and punish him
for his crimes .
thank you . excuse me .
yeah , garcia .
sir , i found something odd
in tabitha ryerson &apos;s records .
it turns out she was quite the independent contractor .
she accepted credit card payments .
there &apos;s one here for a new client
she was going to see for the first time tomorrow .
it &apos;s labeled &quot; mack . &quot; i &apos;m thinking mack the knife , maybe .
what &apos;s the name on the credit card ?
i &apos;m gonna ask you this one time .
did you write on that desk ?
i don &apos;t know .
i asked you a yes or no question .
&quot; i don &apos;t know &quot; is not an answer .
&quot; i don &apos;t know &quot; is for children of poor character ,
who come face to face with their own failings
as stewards of the community .
now , yes or no ,
did you write that disgusting message on the desk ? !
principal mcintyre !
who are you ?
we &apos;re with the fbi , and you need to let that child go
and come with us .
i &apos;m the principal of this school .
you can &apos;t just walk in here .
yeah , well , we need to talk about mack the knife .
look , those women i had sessions with ,
ok , maybe some money changed hands ,
but that was just for their time .
yeah , we read the disclaimers
on those escort websites , too .
take us through the different prostitutes you hired .
sado @-@ masochism is not a crime .
it &apos;s legal , as long as i don &apos;t have sex with them .
and--and--
and you--and you can &apos;t tell anybody about this .
i &apos;m entitled to my privacy on this . i have kids .
you &apos;re not here because of the s &amp; m.
you &apos;re here because of the murders .
what murders ?
tabitha ryerson .
she &apos;s dead ?
i was gonna meet with her for the first time tomorrow .
now it &apos;s your turn .
you give us names .
uh , hannah kelly .
uh , carol rodgers ,
abigail jones .
abigail &apos;s my favorite .
what about the men ?
so you know about that , too ?
mm @-@ hmm . just assume we know everything .
that way , things will go a lot easier for all of us .
lucas wagner . just him .
now , they all call you mack the knife .
do you still have the knife you used on them ?
what do you mean ?
well , you cut them , didn &apos;t you ?
no .
you--you don &apos;t understand . this is--
no , i &apos;m not being threatening , ok ?
i just want to show you what i mean .
you see ?
they cut me .
how could it not be him ?
he had s &amp; m sessions with all the victims .
we profiled that this unsub would be submissive in public
and dominant with the prostitiutes ,
and mcintyre is the opposite .
he takes the submissive role in the s &amp; m play
most likely because he &apos;s so dominant
as a principal at his parochial school .
so we &apos;re back to the starting point .
our best bet is still the prostitutes .
tabitha &apos;s death might scare some of them into talking to us .
mrs. lawson ?
did preacher mills talk to you ?
not since yesterday . why ?
we were talking in his church , and one of the girls ,
belinda , i think , came in begging for help .
the preacher said he was gonna tell you what she saw
and get an update on the case ,
but he never game back .
when was this ?
this morning .
no , we haven &apos;t seen him .
what do you mean ?
she said the same thing my sister did .
they were coming to get her .
what the hell &apos;s going on ?
excuse me for just a moment .
guys , i think i know what the lavender
on tabitha ryerson &apos;s legs is about .
have you ever heard of spikenard ?
uh , no .
it &apos;s perfume .
it &apos;s mentioned in the gospels .
it &apos;s derived from lavender .
it &apos;s what mary magdalene used to wash jesus &apos; feet ,
which tells us that this unsub &apos;s message
is obviously religious in nature .
preacher mills , maybe . he came forward to volunteer information .
well , yesterday he said he &apos;d let us know
if he had any more information ,
but apparently he &apos;s changed his mind .
he fits the profile .
he &apos;s morally rigorous , submissive in public .
so we &apos;ll put an apb out for him .
dinah !
where &apos;s dinah ? !
check the back , padre .
i got 15 minutes , preach ,
if you &apos;re interested .
dinah .
what &apos;s goin &apos; on , preach ?
the man upstairs wants answers .
if you can &apos;t make sure my bitches are safe ,
then what good are you ?
i don &apos;t know who &apos;s hurtin &apos; &apos; em .
well , figure it out .
unless you want to join them .
i haven &apos;t seen the preacher since this morning .
he was talking to one of those girls .
do you know if she &apos;s still here ?
i think she slipped out .
her name was belinda .
do you mind if we check the back ?
oh , no .
well , i don &apos;t get it .
牧师不在这
if the preacher had something to do with it ,
then why was he so helpful ?
unsubs insert themselves into investigations all the time .
they enjoy the power and
the feeling that they &apos;re smarter than us .
and to keep tabs on the case .
he wanted to know how close we were to catching him .
go ahead , garcia .
sir , i got the backhoe going into this not @-@ so @-@ clean preacher .
i haven &apos;t found his present whereabouts yet ,
but i &apos;m looking at his bank account . i can tell you
he doesn &apos;t adhere to the &quot; give all your money to the poor &quot; model .
any idea where the money &apos;s coming from ?
not yet . but it &apos;s mostly cash ,
and we &apos;re talking 6 figures big .
you know , maybe it &apos;s sex trafficking .
this unsub is able to get prostitutes to let their guard down .
they &apos;re somebody he knows .
i thought you said our killer was a john .
prostitutes would rat out a john or kill him themselves ,
but they would never go against their own pimp .
garcia , take everything we know about mills
and run it up against pandering and procuring charges .
this isn &apos;t the first time he &apos;s done this .
you got it .
i swear to god ,
i don &apos;t know who &apos;s doing this .
all i ask is you keep my property clean .
no diseases , no drugs , and you collect my money .
now , which john likes to beat them ?
who likes to get rough ?
i don &apos;t know !
who likes to tie them down ?
&apos;cause that &apos;s who &apos;s doing this !
there &apos;s the guys over in oakwood
who can get a little freaky .
stop ! stop ! stop .
stop .
and then there &apos;s mike , our mechanic .
i mean , he had tabitha bleeding once .
mike &apos;s so fat , he gets winded hoisting a damn hot dog .
he couldn &apos;t tie her to a tree !
and then there &apos;s travis , the druggie .
yeah . yeah , he snitches to the cops for quick fixes .
yeah , and he cut belinda once .
i mean , he could &apos;ve made the wounds on the girls .
you know what these wounds look like ?
i heard from one of the girls at the station
that they were kind of criss @-@ cross .
i mean , travis could have done that .
what else have you heard ?
the feds are looking for someone
who wants to clean up the streets .
it is time to pay the butcher a visit .
well , travis lives near rodgers park ,
but he does coke in that house on dunbar .
did you know the charge of being a pimp ,
when gussied up , is &quot; procuring and pandering &quot; ?
and hotch was right .
preacher mills is familiar with this charge .
because before he was justin mills , he was gordon borell ,
and he was arrested for cutting one of the ladies he employed .
where did he cut her ?
on the back . when questioned , she said--
oh , i &apos;m gonna have to look at kitten videos after this--
he was marking his property .
you &apos;re kidding .
that &apos;s why he specifically asked me
about the wounds on lucas wagner .
he knew we &apos;d find out about his past .
why didn &apos;t we turn this up before now ?
because he changed his name when he crossed the border .
the northern border to be exact .
mr. mills , nee borell ,
is from tees , alberta .
i &apos;ll tell you what . those canadians ,
they seem so sweet and innocent ,
but when they go bad , they go darth vader bad .
so he came here to start over ,
took on the mantle of the collar
as the perfect cover for the sex trade .
no one in this town would question a man of god .
but now we got the smoking gun we need on this guy .
garcia , was there an attempted murder charge ?
no . in fact , she said he wanted her to go back out
and start working when he was done cutting her .
he &apos;s not our unsub .
go , go .
travis .
no . no , no .
word is you &apos;re quite skilled with a knife , travis . huh ? !
are you framin &apos; me ?
no , man .
you tell me the truth , you son of a bitch .
i--i didn &apos;t do-- i didn &apos;t do it .
then who is ? !
someone &apos;s trying to make this look like my handiwork .
you tell them to make themselves known
or i damn sure will .
what do you want me to do ?
work a miracle .
this guy fits to a &quot; t. &quot;
how can we rule him out ?
criminally , pimps follow the same behavioral pattern
as drug dealers .
prostitutes are his revenue stream .
he would only kill them as a last resort .
which is why the cutting in canada was a punishment ,
not a religious punishment ,
but a punishment for not doing their jobs .
then he comes here to start over , set up a new shop .
and that &apos;s when somebody found out about his past ,
used it as a forensic countermeasure to throw us off track
by framing him .
that &apos;s why the girls kept saying , &quot; they &apos;re &quot; after us .
there wasn &apos;t a team of unsubs , but one sadist
copying the behavior of another .
it would also explain the change with tabitha ,
the escalation , the perfume on the feet .
but you said the unsub wanted us to catch him and punish him .
what he really wanted was for us to catch the preacher .
so whoever this guy is , he &apos;s fooled all of us ,
and now we got nothin &apos; when it comes to the profile .
no , that &apos;s not true . the unsub chose mills for a reason ,
and mills can still lead us to the unsub .
we &apos;ll have agent morgan and the deputies start at his house .
what ? !
i got the guy who did it .
good boy .
is it one of them ?
yeah .
and i even got the gun he used to kill them .
all right . where can we meet ?
regular place , two hours ?
i did what you said .
yes , you did .
that &apos;s a good job , too . i almost believed you .
come on , man , give me the stuff .
oh , right . here you go .
no , no !
we just went through the preacher &apos;s house . no one &apos;s in there .
but i did find cocaine in a hidden compartment .
how much ?
a kilo . with that amount ,
he &apos;s not just using it , he &apos;s selling it , too .
if that &apos;s the case , then the suspect pool
of whoever &apos;s framing him just got a lot bigger .
well , jj &apos;s headed to the bar to see if dinah &apos;s seen him .
dinah left about an hour ago .
was she with the preacher ?
he was here earlier , dinah and him were talking ,
and then he left all in a huff .
do you know where he was going ?
didn &apos;t ask . he was too pissed off .
all right . thanks .
hey , hotch .
any luck ?
he &apos;s not here either .
i &apos;ve got roadblocks on every corner
in and out of town . he won &apos;t get far .
jj , help canvass the area . we &apos;ll dig deeper here
and see if we can figure out where he &apos;s going .
all right .
yo , this is travis . leave it after the beep .
what --
where are you ?
i don &apos;t see your car here .
you said 8 : 00 . hurry up .
sheriff , be advised .
i &apos;ve got the suspect headed into el lobito &apos;s diner .
repeat , i &apos;ve got the suspect headed into el lobito &apos;s diner .
copy , deputy . we &apos;re on our way .
we got him .
all right , blake , you and reid go with the sheriff .
dave and i will coordinate the response here .
the preacher &apos;s not answering .
keep trying . we need to tell him
we know he didn &apos;t do this .
oh , preacher , what have you gotten yourself into ?
i didn &apos;t do any of this .
you did this to me .
is that what you &apos;re gonna tell the feds ?
who , incidentally , are on their way .
you think they &apos;re gonna believe a pimp like you ?
sorry . a preacher like you ?
we had a deal .
yes , we did , but the deal &apos;s changed .
i helped you !
and i &apos;m helping you .
i didn &apos;t leave you empty @-@ handed .
you got yourself a fighting chance .
oh , you hear those sirens ?
tick tock , preacher , tick tock .
i will destroy you .
in heaven or in hell ?
which one are you gonna go to , huh ?
you got anything you want to get off your chest ,
because the hour of reckoning is upon you , preacher man .
you son of a bitch .
next time you tell your whores to keep their mouths shut .
good luck .
he &apos;s been in there a good 5 minutes now .
i haven &apos;t seen any movement yet .
what about patrons ?
uh , it &apos;s closed .
how many entrances ?
two , it looks like .
the question is , is he alone ?
guys , i &apos;ve got movement .
we should move in now , sheriff .
actually , we &apos;re better off establishing the perimeter first .
then we can open up a line of communication .
all right , agreed . we need to get around --
shots fired ! shots fired !
blake !
reid !
move !
go , go , go , go , go , go , go !
