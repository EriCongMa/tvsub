No bro pound?
Aonani, give me some love, huh?
You be good out there, Mr. Zack.
I will.
Well...
Auf Wiedersehen, happy trails and all that.
Hey, mom.
Honey.
You're so thin.
What's up, little man?
I missed you.
You know that?
Dad, I'm sorry.
Get in the car, son.
Honey, we're lost.
Why can't you just admit it?
We are not lost.
Looks like you crushed your old high score.
This is not the way we came.
Honey, you took a wrong turn back there.
It's impossible.
I'm following the GPS.
Well, then the GPS is wrong.
We haven't seen a house for miles.
Maybe we should turn around and go back.
Honey, please, okay, just relax.
Dad, speed up.
What?
Dad, speed up. Don't stop.
What's going on?
C'mere, sit back buddy.
Get away from us!
Leave him alone!
What are you doing to him?
Zack!
Let him go! Let him go!
Zack!
Let go of my son!
William.
Mary, hey.
Steve.
Aloha.
How are you?
I'm good. I didn't realize you were
bringing your friend with you. Who is this?
Oh, I'm sorry. My manners.
Morty, this is Steve.
Pleasure to meet you, sir.
Isn't it?
So, this is the big brother, huh?
Doesn't look so big to me.
Mary, please tell me you did not marry him.
Ew, no.
Of course not.
Okay.
But I mean, not for lack of trying.
He's been proposing to me ever since we met.
Why is he here?
Because I can't leave him.
What are you talking about?
Oh, I'm his caregiver.
You're his caregiver?
Yeah, the flight attendant thing didn't work out so well.
Steve, listen please.
I really think that this could be my true calling.
I love taking care of people.
Well, that's funny, Mary,
because you can barely take care of yourself.
We take care of each other.
Don't we, doll?
Morty, do you remember our conversation
about professional boundaries?
No.
Memory's not so good.
How about this, Morty,
you touch my sister again like that,
I'm gonna break your hand.
Think you can remember that?
He's as surly as you described.
At ease, sailor.
Why is he here?
Because I have responsibilities now, Steve.
And besides, visiting Hawaii was on Morty's bucket list.
Okay, you know what,
I need to talk to you in private right now.
Morty, my brother needs to talk to me in private.
Thank you.
So, what this big secret you can't tell me over the phone?
It's about mom.
She's not coming, is she?
I mean, you can't blame her, mom.
She thought you were dead.
Where's she staying?
Okay. I'll just track her down myself.
Acquiring target locations
is actually a specialty of mine, so...
Mom.
Mom, Mary's your daughter; she's not a target.
I'm sorry. Look...
give her some space, okay?
Give her some time.
When she's ready, she's gonna come to you.
And what if that never happens?
Is that her?
No, no, no, stand down, mom.
It's work.
Did you just tell me to stand down?
Affirmative. Now, if you don't mind...
Okay, okay.
McGarrett.
Yeah, I'll be there in 20.
None of this makes any sense.
Zack's a good kid.
Uh, you did just pick him up after a six-month stay
at juvenile hall though, right?
It was just a prank.
Not exactly.
Zack took things too far and he paid the price.
What exactly did he do?
Hacked into the White House database
and got tickets to the Correspondents' Dinner.
They wanted to make an example out of Zack,
and they gave him a six month sentence.
What about when he was locked up,
any trouble, fights that he got into,
anything you know of?
No.
None that he mentioned.
What are you guys doing way out here
in the middle of nowhere, anyway?
I was just following the GPS.
Hey, Charlie, is it possible to hack a GPS
and send somebody off course?
Yeah, but it's a fairly sophisticated process.
I'll have to get it back to the lab to be sure.
You think someone lured them out here?
Well, it's a remote location.
It's the perfect spot to grab somebody
without any witnesses.
This was a highly planned and perfectly executed abduction.
Your name is James, right?
Well, my name is Kono, James.
And we're here to find your brother, Zack.
Maybe you saw something that can help us?
Can I see?
You get something from the brother?
Yeah, license plate.
He was typing it over and over again on his tablet.
I'm running it now.
Okay, so the van was reported stolen yesterday.
Looks like it was logged back in the system 15 minutes ago.
Wait a minute, it's already been recovered?
Yeah, and it's headed on its way back
to the HPD impound lot.
You guys move fast.
I haven't even done inventory on it yet.
It's a kidnapping case.
Time's a luxury we don't have.
What the hell?
Looks like our kidnapping case just turned to murder.
Max, no cane. Looking good.
Mahalo. Another couple of weeks,
and I can resume my spinning classes.
That's nice, I just got a visual of you
wearing biker shorts.
Thank you.
My pleasure.
Now if you'll allow me to demonstrate my newfound mobility,
I have some information on your murder victim.
The cause of death was cardiac arrest.
Seriously?
Unquestionably.
Wait a minute, how does a 17-year-old
die of a heart attack?
Well, according to your victim's medical records,
he suffered from a history of arrhythmia.
I believe that his condition was exacerbated
by physical trauma.
He was tortured.
Yes, and from the looks of it, they broke his fingers
one by one, a crude,
but effective torture method.
What could a 17-year-old possibly know
that warrants being tortured to death?
That would be your jurisdiction, detective.
That's why I asked him.
However, I did find something else quite interesting.
These bruises are consistent with CPR.
With CPR? What, they tried to revive him?
Yes.
Which means whatever they wanted
out of the kid... they didn't get.
The warden said that Zack was a model prisoner.
He kept to himself, and stayed out of trouble.
Except for one incident,
where he got into a shouting match
with someone who was visiting him.
Now, Kono checked all the visitor's logs,
and other than his mother,
the only person who came to see him
was Kong Liang.
Who is he?
Kong Liang.
Chinese national and notorious cyber-criminal.
FBI has him involved in
banking trojans, scareware, identity theft.
I mean, you name the cyber crime and he's into it.
He's also very into making money.
HPD Cyber Crime task force
estimates that he pulls down
between $25 million and $50 million a year.
Okay, why is Kong Liang not in prison?
The FBI's been trying to make a case for years,
but he has the best hackers covering his trail.
Word is, he runs his operation like a sweatshop,
recruiting computer experts from around the world.
That would explain the prison visit.
Yeah, maybe Zack turned him down,
or Kong Liang wanted information that Zack had.
All right, so Kong Liang hires a couple of goons
to kidnap this kid the day he gets out of the can.
That's a hell of a recruiting pitch.
Right. Where do we find him?
Well, HPD has zero leads on his location.
The guy's a ghost.
No problem.
How is that no problem?
It's no problem because you forget that I have
a CI deeply embedded in the hacker game.
These computer geeks, they all know each other.
There you go, brah.
Completely reconditioned.
There's nothing free about free porn.
Think before you link...
Hey, what's up, Toast?
Jersey.
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.
You got a minute?
Hey, look, guys.
Before I talk, I just want to make sure
I-I have total impunity.
You mean immunity.
Yes.
That-that is what I meant.
Look, I'm just worried about blowback.
I have mouths to feed, responsibilities.
Roommates to think of--
Rocky and Bullwinkle.
A moose and a flying squirrel?
No.
Those are their hacker handles.
Ah. My job at Digi-Dome
is the only thing that's keeping us in Cap'n Crunch.
What is that? Is that another hacker handle?
Will you speak English, please?
It's a cereal.
People eat it in the mornings.
Toast, listen.
Whatever you tell us is going to be kept in strict confidence.
All right?
Look, if that means that no one's gonna find out
where this came from, then great.
'Cause I'm not a snitch, okay?
Okay. Now that we got that out of the way,
maybe we can start with an easy one.
Can you help us find Kong Liang?
Yeah, of course.
But that guy's beaucoup bad news, guys.
He runs a hacker crew.
And he invited me to come and be a part of it,
but I politely declined because of the illegal nature of it.
This kid-- he ever work for Kong?
That's Omega Man.
Zack Slater.
I only know him by his hacker handle.
He's crazy good.
Now he's crazy dead.
Tortured and killed this morning.
And we have reason to believe
that Kong and this is connected.
That's heavy.
I mean, if Kong Liang deleted Zack,
you guys are not gonna be able to
connect him to it.
Well, that's fine.
We're gonna get him for hacking,
we push for the maximum.
You're not gonna get him for that, either.
I mean, the moment he sees you two guys coming,
uh, he will wipe his trail clean with one keystroke.
Game over.
No, he won't.
Why is that?
Well, 'cause it won't be us that he sees coming.
This is crazy, I can't...
I... I can't wear a wire.
This is crazy.
I-I'm... this is against my philosophy.
Stay alive.
Would you shut up, please?
Okay. You're fine.
Remember, we gave you impunity. You're gonna be fine.
Remember, you're doing this for, uh, Rocky and Bullwinkle.
Guys, there's... there's something I haven't told you.
What is that?
I...
have a glandular issue.
What kind of glands we talking here, Toast?
Um... my sweat glands.
I usually use beta-blockers in stressful situations like this,
but you know... too late.
Sometimes, when it just starts,
I just can't stop it, it just keeps going.
Okay, enough.
It doesn't stop.
Enough. Enough. Please.
I mean, what if I sweat so much
that it gets into this pack and it electrocutes me?
That unit is gland-proof. Okay?
Hey, Toast, Toast.
Just remember the plan, okay?
You're there to offer your services, that's it.
When you get alone,
I want you to download everything off his computer
onto this thing here. We will take care of the rest.
I don't think I can do this, guys.
Toast? Live long and perspire.
All right? It's gonna be great. Okay?
We've confirmed Kong's inside.
It's game time. Come on.
Let's go.
Hey, guys.
I'm here to see Kong.
Really like you guys matching stripes.
All right, Toast, you're in.
This is a really bad idea, guys.
Please, just relax. Everything is gonna be fine.
I promise.
I have a retail job that I need to be alive to get paid for.
Do you understand?
Toast, listen to me.
Just tell Kong you're after some quick cash.
When he's distracted,
you do your thing, okay?
Well, if he doesn't get distracted, what's plan B?
There's not a plan B because plan A is gonna work.
Okay? Just relax,
control your glands, everything's gonna be fine.
There's no plan B?
How do you not have a plan B?
Everyone has a plan B.
We barely have a plan A.
Stop talking, Toast, okay?
Oh, my God.
What? Door's open.
Get up.
See what you made me do?
Now, go get that fixed.
And then get back to work.
Toast!
There's only one reason you're here.
Uh, that...
You want a job, right?
Yes, you want a job.
Yes.
I can't... I can't do this, guys!
Plan B!
Nice job, Toast.
This is why you have a plan B.
Three... two...
First one who walks through that door
goes out on a stretcher!
One... go.
You done?
I want to talk to my lawyer.
What, exactly, are you gonna tell your lawyer?
That Five-O raided your illegal hack shop,
during which you fired a big cannon at my face.
And then following your apprehension,
we download everything on these goofy little computers,
and we find out that you are indeed
a world-class cyber thief.
Go ahead, call. Use my phone, I'll dial it for you.
You know what, don't forget to tell your lawyer
about kidnapping and murdering Zack Slater.
I don't know no Zack Slater.
Oh, really? That's-that's actually very funny,
because we have you visiting him just a week ago.
What happened, you offer him a job,
he turned you down, so you kill him?
Correction: you tortured him,
and then you killed him.
Was it a job... or were you trying to
get information and it went bad. What?
This kid could hack into
the most secure mainframes in the world
in the time it would take you to sign into your e-mail account.
So that's why you went to see him in prison?
I invited him to work for me.
This-this kid's in jail,
and you still offer him a job?
I enjoy the challenge.
But he said no?
Kid didn't want to disappoint his parents again.
So he was done hacking.
Must have pissed you off.
Kong Liang offers this kid a job,
and he says no.
Yeah.
But I decided to play the long game.
Figured if he ever came around,
he knew he'd have a job.
Okay. Who else do you know that was after this kid?
I don't know.
Kid hacked a lot of people
before he suddenly grew a conscience in the joint.
Any one of them could be looking for a little payback.
I remember the day...
that you told me that mommy wasn't going
to be coming home anymore.
I remember that night I went into your room and...
...I saw you sitting on your bed, crying.
And that scared me, dad.
I miss you so much, dad.
I slept on Steve's floor
'cause I didn't want to be alone, you know...
and I guess I've been that way ever since.
But when Steve just told me that she was alive...
...all I could do was think
about you that night crying, dad.
I'm just so angry for what she's put you through.
And I miss you so much.
I miss you.
I miss you, and it just hurts so bad.
I love you.
All right. Thanks for coming.
Where else was I going to go?
I've been to a lot of stone gardens, kid,
but I got to say, this is by far the nicest.
Not too shabby a place to end up, I think.
I think you have to be part of the military
to be buried here.
Sweetie,I'm retired air force--
the 34th Bomb Squadron-- so sign me up.
Come on, now, we still have a whole island to see, Morty.
Now, that's my girl.
Now, mush.
Ready?
Yeah.
Let's go.
What's up?
So, I had the lab take a look at Zack's laptop.
You mean the one they confiscated
when he was arrested.
Yeah, so nothing stands out on the hard drive,
but take a look at this.
Right before he was sent to juvie,
Zack uploaded a file to this offline storage site.
What's on the file?
No idea.
Because the password has a 1024-bit encryption,
which means the password is 309 numbers long,
which means it's impossible to crack unless we have the code.
Right-- well, whatever's on that file, it must be important.
Maybe that's what Zack's killers were after.
Yeah.
I'll get Toast on it, see if he can hack in.
Okay, that's gonna take days.
Which is why you need
to pay Zack's parents a visit now.
See if we can expedite things.
Okay, how's that gonna help us get a password any faster?
Well, with a password that long, Zack may have written it down.
See if they know anything.
If they don't, check the house.
Maybe he hid it somewhere.
I just should've forgiven him.
He knew that you loved him.
I just wish I could've told him.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
How can we help you?
It's actually why I'm here.
We believe the men who murdered your son
wanted something that he had.
What could they possibly want from Zack?
A password... to his offline storage site.
A password? He never said anything about a password.
Do you mind if I look up in his room?
No, uh... it's, uh, upstairs to the left.
Aloha.
It's all right.
Your parents said it was okay that I was up here.
You want to hold it?
F-I-V-E, zero.
Five-O.
It's like a special kind of police officer.
You know, James...
you might be able to help me.
I'm looking for something that your brother Zack...
...may have left here.
It's very important.
It's called a password.
Do you know where he might have kept it?
Gold.
Gold-- are you talking about my badge?
Zinc, argon, nitrogen,
palladium, bromine, ruthenium...
Okay, hold on... what are you trying to say?
Mercury, copper, thallium...
Did your brother teach you that?
James?
Can you share with me what your brother taught you?
Gold, zinc, argon,
nitrogen, palladium, bromine, ruthenium,
mercury, copper, thallium, ununtrium.
Okay, can you tell me from the beginning one more time?
Gold, zinc, argon,
nitrogen, palladium,
bromine, ruthenium, mercy,
copper, thallium, ununtrium.
Chin, I have the password.
So it's the periodic table?
Yeah, Zack had his little brother James memorize
a string of elements,
so I started writing down
the atomic numbers in that order,
and I figured it out.
It's 309 numbers.
It's Zack's password and we got it.
Good work, Kono.
All right, give me a second to upload...
Kono?
Get out! Get out!
Don't shoot, don't shoot!
Move it!
James, can you come with me?
Get up, now!
Ladies and gentlemen, we're not going to hurt you.
If you have mobile device or all these decice,
you should've known those have been disabled.
If you try to use it, you will get shot.
So stay calm!
Stay calm!
Go upstairs and do it now.
Ladies and gentlemen...
You need to be really quiet. I am not going to hurt you, okay.
Hands on your head, right now!
I'm sorry, I was looking for the bathroom.
Shut up! Let's go, downstairs!
Move it!
Hey, where you going?
Slater house.
I just got a call from Kono-- she was about to give me
the password to Zack's storage site
and then the phone went dead and I can't reach her now.
I got a uni heading over there right now,
but I got a bad feeling about this, Steve.
Officer. Can I help you?
Good afternoon, ma'am.
Everything okay inside?
Yes, of course.
I was told Officer Kalakaua would be inside.
Is she here?
She was here.
She, uh, she left about 20 minutes ago.
Looks like I just missed her. Well, have a good day.
Okay.
10-15! 10-15! I've been shot!
I repeat...
All units, all units,
we have an officer down.
Unit two, Bravo-170 is off at...
Let's go, let's move it out!
Stop right there!
Well,
thanks to Officer Manuwai,
the plan has changed.
Go, go, go, go, go!
Chin!
I'm calling everyone in on this.
Where's Kono?
They got her.
All right, FLIR scan shows 19 people inside.
Judging by motion patterns,
we have got four hostage takers.
All right, phone lines are jammed.
Chin, how'd you do with the cars?
All right, we checked every vehicle in the area--
we found one that was reported stolen.
That's our killer's M.O..
Yeah. Crime lab lifted a print off of it,
but when they ran it through AFIS, they didn't get a match.
Widen the search.
Check military databases, foreign and domestic.
Military databases? Why?
Chin, these guys have fortified their position here,
they're using the hostages as a human shield,
they jammed the phone lines.
They're pros, okay?
They're either ex-military
or they're civilian contractors.
Either way, there's got to be a record of them somewhere.
Yeah, I'm on it.
What are you doing?
We're gonna be here for a while. Settle in.
Did you find it?
Not yet.
Maybe it's not here.
Oh, it's here.
Come on, daddy.
Let's go.
Get down. Turn around.
Your son took something from me.
I want it back now.
I don't know what you're talking about, I swear.
Please. Please. Don't hurt her!
Listen, listen! That is totally up to you.
Why don't you just leave them alo...
What the hell's going on in there?
I'm going to ask you one more time.
If you don't give me the answer I'm looking for,
you get to watch your wife die.
Do you understand?
Yes.
Guys.
You were right.
Military came back with a hit on that print.
Sean Winston.
Ex-South African Special Forces.
I'm just taking a wild guess here,
this guy went into business for himself?
Yeah.
He started a private military company called White Fire.
White Fire.
They specialize in covert,
wet work, black ops--
the dirty stuff the governments don't want to admit to.
That doesn't explain
what they want with a high school kid.
Well, White Fire would have a lot of secrets
they'd kill to keep hidden. Maybe Zack stumbled upon one of 'em.
If you're right I really hope that one of those secrets
is not worth another body.
Hey, what's the matter with you?
What's up?
I sent her in there.
Okay.
You don't put that on yourself, you got it?
We're gonna get her out.
So let's go do that.
Yeah.
Last chance.
Where did your son hide the password?
I don't know. I swear,
I don't know anything about a password.
Please don't hurt my wife.
That is not the answer
I was looking for!
I thought you said you checked upstairs.
I did.
Check again.
Who's up there?
I-I don't know.
No.
Shut up.
Shut up.
Please don't hurt my little boy.
Pipe down. Shut up.
James.
Look what I found.
Well, well, well,
it looks like one of you
is Five-O.
I'll give that person five seconds to come forward...
...or I will put a hole in this child!
No!
Five... four...
three... two...
No!
I'm Five-O.
They don't have the password.
I do.
Give me the password.
Release the hostages.
Not gonna happen.
The only way you're gonna get the password
is if you release the hostages.
Once they're safe,
I'll give you the password.
Shoot me, you get nothing.
You're coming with us.
Once the hostages are free.
Yes, hello. I know you can hear me.
I'd like to speak to the person in charge.
Commander.
This is Commander McGarrett at Five-O.
Commander McGarrett, it seems like
we have one of yours with us.
What do you want?
World peace. A cure for AIDS would be nice.
Banquets for the hungry.
In the meantime,
I will take an armored vehicle
backed up to the front of this house.
Park and walk away.
Once me, my team, and your friend drive away,
you can come in and collect the hostages.
You have 20 minutes.
All right, guys, get back, get back.
Come here! Get in there!
Come on! Let's go!
Check on the hostages, make sure everyone's all right.
I'll take the password, please.
You guys are good to go.
Come on, come on, come on.
Thank you.
In five!
All right, babe, we're good to go in five,
four...
three...
two, one!
Kono!
You okay?
I'm fine.
Hey, guys.
Hey, what are you doing? I thought you were supposed
to be in the hospital?
No, it's just a few scrapes.
You're okay?
Yeah.
You're just in time.
We unlocked Zack's storage site.
Turns out he had an encryption method
that even impressed Toast.
Mega awesome encryption, brah.
Quote, unquote.
Richard DeSalvo. Zack must have hacked
into White Fire's mainframe and downloaded his file.
So who is Richard DeSalvo?
He was a mob boss who disappeared
from protective custody three years ago.
Had a rap sheet
that made Whitey Bulger look cuddly.
Winston and his organization helped him disappear,
for a price, of course, and then
they mopped up anybody who could turn on him if he was ever found.
Richard DeSalvo!
Look on the bright side,
now you don't have to look over your shoulder anymore.
Your son didn't die for nothing.
Because of what he did, an infamous mobster
went to prison for the rest of his life.
Thank you.
And thank you, James, for your help.
Your brother would have been very proud.
F-I-V-E, zero.
F-I-V-E, zero.
Keep it.
You earned it.
Mary, I need you to do something for me.
What? I'll do anything.
I need you to go see your mother.
I can't.
You can't or you won't?
Both.
Morty, she disappeared from my life
when I was ten years old, Morty.
Gone.
This whole time I've thought she's dead.
But she's not.
You get a second chance, kid.
Other people aren't so lucky.
I'd give everything I own to have a second chance.
What are you talking about?
Zoe Anne Sapperstein...
My only daughter.
You had a daughter, Morty?
I didn't know you had a daughter.
Yeah.
We got into a fight over this boy she was seeing.
Her mother and I disapproved.
She left college and took off
for San Francisco with the guy.
We didn't speak for years.
One day the phone rang.
It was the Highway Patrol.
Carpet salesman from Oakland had too much to drink.
He fell asleep behind the wheel and hit my daughter's car.
Killed her instantly.
Not a day goes by
I don't wish
I'd picked up the phone
and called her.
I let the privilege of knowing her slip away because
I was a stubborn SOB.
Don't make the same mistake.
Put away your anger.
Go see your mother.
You only have one family.
Mom?
Why?!
Why?
