hey , guys , guys ? that &apos;s enough with the bag .
settle down . are we excited to go ?
yes !
are you gonna behave ?
yes !
three days ago ,
the five @-@ o task force seized $ 80 million worth of cocaine being
smuggled into honolulu harbor on a colombian fishing vessel .
i see you broke out the formal wear , too , huh ?
dog and pony show-- perfect occasion to wear a tie .
i always liked the tie .
five @-@ o &apos;s courageous actions
have made our state a safer place .
five @-@ o acted in cooperation with customs ,
dea and hpd
to orchestrate an efficient and coordinated take down of
what appears to be a major player in the global drug trade .
we appreciate the help
from our law enforcement counterparts and will continue
to rely on them as this investigation moves forward .
we feel we sent a strong message
to the south american cartels .
the state of hawaii will not be used as a way station
for illegal narcotic trafficking .
jay , what &apos;s going on ?
it &apos;s a car accident .
it &apos;s all right , everybody . just stay in your seats .
you guys okay ? anybody hurt ?
yeah . you .
kids , get down ! get down !
we have heard the testimony from
lieutenant commander mcgarrett about your actions in korea .
if his account is accurate , which we are here to verify ,
then this board has the utmost respect
for your bravery and heroism .
thank you , sir .
is it true you led four civilians into enemy territory
and extracted the area with zero personnel casualties ?
yes , sir .
you engaged an enemy who outnumbered and outarmed you ,
and you were victorious ?
yes , sir .
&quot; adapt and overcome , &quot; that &apos;s our motto .
and you entered hostile territory
on a decommissioned helicopter that by most estimates would be
considered unmaneuverable , let alone battle @-@ ready ?
i had the help of an experienced civilian pilot , sir .
you &apos;re saying you proceeded without the aid
of any other active members of the military ?
yes , sir .
lieutenant commander , under most circumstances ,
i would be pinning a silver star to your lapel .
unfortunately ,
those are not the circumstances we find ourselves in today .
is there anything you &apos;d like to say in your defense ?
lieutenant commander mcgarrett was in trouble .
i did what was needed to get him home .
i would do it again if i had to .
okay , you &apos;re smiling .
that &apos;s never good .
what did they decide ?
the navy is giving me a chance to pursue my dreams .
no , joe . no , no .
i &apos;ve always wanted to open a bar .
okay , they cannot force you out .
well , call it an opportunity for early retirement ,
with full benefits .
you know what ?
i &apos;m gonna talk to the board of inquiry ...
no , forget it .
it &apos;s over , son .
i spent half my life serving my country , and i &apos;m proud of it .
no regrets .
this is my fault , joe .
no , my actions are my responsibility .
so , how about you treat me to a shrimp jambalaya
and we will call it square .
let me tell you something , okay ?
you &apos;re the only man on this planet
that would see shrimp jambalaya as a fair trade
to the end of his career , you know that ?
go ahead , take it .
we &apos;ll talk over dinner .
mcgarrett .
i &apos;ll be right there .
what do we know ?
looks like a kidnapping , right ? we got 16 kids , three adults
from south shore children &apos;s academy ; they were on a field trip .
someone comes , takes the whole bus .
parents been notified ?
kono &apos;s on her way to the school right now
to meet them and prepare them for a ransom call .
who &apos;s the vic , chin ?
jay katsu , driver of the bus .
still waiting on max , but the cause of death appears
to be three gunshots to the chest , close range .
here &apos;s what i think .
all right , guy gets out of the bus to see what &apos;s going on .
comes over here-- boom-- gets popped by one of the kidnappers .
wait a minute .
what are you thinking ?
this accident was staged .
look at this . there &apos;s no skid marks .
neither of the airbags have been deployed .
there &apos;s minimal damage .
now who do these cars belong to ?
well , hpd ran the plates .
turns out , both vehicles were reported stolen last night .
i just spoke to the witness who called 911 .
she came on the accident about 20 minutes ago .
driver was already dead .
she see the school bus ?
yeah , she reported
seeing one traveling at high speeds , heading south .
well , if they reached the h3,
they could be anywhere on the island .
all right , we need the cell numbers
of all the people on that bus .
pinging their phones is gonna be
our best chance of locating them .
everyone , put your phones in the bag .
let &apos;s go !
give me your phone .
let &apos;s go !
i said now ! let &apos;s go ! phones in the bag .
i said phones in the bag !
what &apos;s you looking at ?
that &apos;s right . let &apos;s go !
you ! i said you ! let &apos;s go !
hey , kids now ! come on . pop it up . let &apos;s go .
let &apos;s go . i &apos;ve got all day .
let &apos;s go ! come on , now .
i said now !
open the door .
you ! what do you think you &apos;re doing ?
today &apos;s not the day to be a hero .
listen , are our kids okay ?
what do the kidnappers want ?
we &apos;re not sure , but we are doing everything necessary
to prepare for a ransom call .
is anyone even spoke to them ?
i know that you want to do everything you can to find
your children , but the best thing you can do right now
is to make sure we have all of your contact information
in case the kidnappers call any of you directly .
we &apos;re gonna be setting it up right here .
thank you very much .
hey , you all right ?
yeah . anything i can tell them ?
no , not yet .
listen , i need you to conduct a background
on every single one of these parents .
why ? you think it could be about one of them ?
kono , it could be about all of them .
i mean , this isn &apos;t a coincidence
these guys hijacked a bus from a high @-@ priced private school .
these kids-- they were targeted .
we need to find out why .
all right ?
yeah .
okay . got it .
all right . i just got off the phone with hpd .
they found a bag of cell phones belonging to
our victims dumped under the likelike overpass .
two highways intersect there ,
and there are six off @-@ ramps within three miles of that spot .
great , so we have no idea
where they are or what direction they are heading .
the two stolen cars used at the staged accidents--
they were both carjackings .
we get a description on the perp ?
better.i got a name .
ken nakoa ? we just put him away for carjacking .
nice to see that our justice system is following through .
yeah , he &apos;s out on bail .
but he is wearing a court @-@ ordered ankle monitor .
okay , good . we get a location ?
probation officer &apos;s pulling the tracking data now .
this doesn &apos;t add up .
nakoa &apos;s a car thief with no record of violent crimes .
he doesn &apos;t fit the profile of a kidnapper .
no , no , he doesn &apos;t . but he &apos;s a businessman .
maybe he worked for the guys who did .
lieutenant kelly . you have that tracking data on ken nakoa ?
yeah , great . send it over .
nakoa &apos;s on the move .
okay , great . i got him .
he &apos;s about a half mile up the road .
all right . which one of those trucks is he in ?
how do i know ?
what do you mean , how do you know ?
you got the thing .
i got a blinking red dot .
that &apos;s all i got . see ?
okay , so if you see anything blinking red ,
go ahead and pull it over .
why are you angry ?
i &apos;m not angry .
why would you be angry right now ?
we &apos;re trying to get this guy .
continue , i &apos;m going to get angry .
nakoa &apos;s got to be in one of those trucks .
how &apos; bout this one ?
nope .
okay , i got him .
is that him ?
not unless he &apos;s wearing a willie nelson disguise .
okay , this has got to be him .
i hope this truck has good brakes .
what ? why ? why do you hope ...
hey , out , out , out , out . move , hands up , hands up .
where &apos;s nakoa ?
i don &apos;t know who that is .
he &apos;s gotta be here somewhere .
go !
pineapples .
maybe he ditched the bracelet .
or maybe someone ditched nakoa .
call his p.o. , all right ? get all the data
off that tracking bracelet for the last 48 hours .
nakoa crossed paths with these kidnappers .
i want to know where .
who is it ?
it &apos;s the ransom call .
chin .
call kono , get a trace on it now .
commander mcgarrett ?
yeah , i didn &apos;t catch your name .
oh , you can just call me
the woman who &apos;s got a gun pointed at 19 hostages .
have any of them been harmed ?
no , not yet .
good , let &apos;s keep it that way .
what do you want ?
we want what &apos;s ours .
the coke you took in that bust at the harbor .
we want it back .
you have two hours to get it together ...
... or kids start dying .
get it ?
not enough time .
what the hell is going on ?
this kidnapping has got nothing to do with the parents .
this kidnapping is about us .
we want what &apos;s ours .
the coke you took in that bust at the harbor .
we want it back .
you have two hours to get it together , commander mcgarrett ,
or kids start dying .
how credible is that threat ?
they &apos;ve already killed one person , sir .
i @-@ i &apos;m pretty sure they &apos;re going to do
whatever they feel like they need
to do to get their drugs back .
well , that &apos;s not gonna happen .
we don &apos;t negotiate with terrorists .
okay , but that &apos;s what we &apos;re saying .
i think we don &apos;t have a choice , sir .
if we give in to their demands ,
we are sending a message that we &apos;re open for business .
today it &apos;s a bus , tomorrow it &apos;s an airplane . then what ?
you need to find these kids some other way .
what do you got from the search teams ?
there &apos;s been no sightings
from helicopters , no sightings from road blocks .
we believe they might be hiding the bus somewhere .
what about the kidnappers-- what do we know about them ?
nothing , nothing .
hpd is still trying to figure out
which cartel the drugs belong to .
what about the harbor bust ? what about those guys ?
there were four hostiles on the vessel when we engaged .
one survived .
mateo vargas . he &apos;s in custody now ,
but he is afraid for his life .
okay , my guess is that he &apos;s not going to cooperate .
then make him .
we just need to ask you a couple of questions
about the people you work for . okay ?
are you crazy ? i &apos;m not telling you guys anything .
well , you don &apos;t really ...
you don &apos;t have a choice in that matter .
it &apos;s unfortunately , man .
guards !
they &apos;re on a break , okay ?
show some respect .
okay , what do you want ?
a busload of kids got kidnapped this morning .
what do you know about that ?
nothing .
don &apos;t lie to me .
i swear to god , i don &apos;t know nothing .
i don &apos;t know nothing .
vargas , listen to me , you got kids ?
huh ? it &apos;s not a hard question-- you have kids ?
yeah .
how many ?
three , three .
three-- boys or girls ?
girls , i have three girls .
okay , now imagine your three girls
are on that bus that he &apos;s talking about . what would you do ?
what would you do ?
i &apos;m telling you ,
i don &apos;t know anything about no kidnapping .
okay . get up .
who do you work for ?
i can &apos;t .
who you working for ?
i can &apos;t tell you .
he knows my family .
he knows where they live .
i swear , if i tell you that , he &apos;ll kill them .
who , who &apos;s going to kill &apos; em ? huh ?
i can &apos;t .
all right . okay , all right .
listen , we can get protection for your family .
you understand what i &apos;m saying ?
i swear to you on my badge ,
i will get protection for your family .
you got to give us a name .
okay ?
okay .
hey , lori , i need you to find out everything you can
about a guy named hugo castillo .
vargas just id &apos;d him as the head of the cartel .
we find him , we find our kidnappers .
thank you , sir .
yeah .
joe .
hey , steve .
what are you doing here ?
recon .
what are you talking about , recon ?
i thought you were gonna open a bar ,
embrace your retirement .
wo fat lured you to korea ,
killed one of your people just to find out
what you know about shelburne ,
and the clock is ticking , steve .
what &apos;s that got to do with you being at halawa today ?
we got to find shelburne before wo fat does ,
and i figure , the only way to do that
is talk to the people closest to him .
who did you come here to see ?
hiro noshimuri .
head of the local yakuza-- i know ,
i put him here .
yeah , months ago ,
only now he &apos;s gone because he got a couple good lawyers ,
got released , and he &apos;s working on an extradition to japan ,
so i got to go .
i &apos;ll call you when i find him .
he was a mid @-@ level hit man
for the tarza cartel in colombia .
nine months ago he took out the higher @-@ ups and he seized control .
well , i ran castillo &apos;s name
through hpd , and no hits on aliases
or any known associates on the island ,
so we have nothing that tells us
where they &apos;re hiding those kids .
well , they only had three days
to put this plan together , so they &apos;re going to pick
a place they trust .
vargas said castillo &apos;s drugs are always brought into the harbor
and delivered to the same place .
stash pad .
right .
maybe that &apos;s where they &apos;re hiding the kids .
where are we on nakoa &apos;s ankle monitor ?
p.o. sent the raw data over , i &apos;m having it mapped now .
nakoa had to drop off those stolen cars somewhere ,
and i &apos;m hoping that &apos;s the stash pad .
we got to do more than hope .
we only have 45 minutes until that next ransom call .
okay , maybe vargas knows where the stash pad is .
don &apos;t count on it .
according to his statement , his job was to sit
on the product in the back of a windowless van .
so he has no idea where it is .
he &apos;s essentially a guard dog with a gun--
and not the smart bomb @-@ sniffing kind .
yeah , but even guard dogs hear things ,
so unless vargas is asleep in the back of the van ,
he knows more than he thinks he does .
where do you get into the van ?
at the docks .
the same docks where we seized the cocaine ?
that &apos;s right .
look , if i help you ,
how do i know that my daughters are safe ?
because commander mcgarrett gave you his word .
look , we don &apos;t have that much time .
i need you to remember .
do you always drop the drugs off at the same place ?
always .
and when you leave the docks ,
does the van turn left or right ?
i don &apos;t know .
i never see where we &apos;re going .
there are no windows .
close your eyes .
take yourself back there .
try to remember .
left , left , i think .
okay .
good .
how long is the ride ?
um , 20 , 25 minutes .
okay , good , think about that 20 to 25 minutes .
what do you hear ,
smell ?
what does it feel like ?
we stopped a lot in the beginning .
okay , traffic lights , good . what else ?
i hear pounding , like metal on wood .
could the pounding have been hammering , like construction ?
yeah , yeah , that sounds right .
yeah , they &apos;re doing some renovations
on the old fisherman &apos;s wharf .
okay , what do you remember next ?
um ... after that , we go into a circle .
on @-@ ramp ?
yeah , i think so ,
&apos;cause we don &apos;t stop for a while after that .
about how long ?
um , 15 , 20 minutes ?
15 to 20 minutes , okay .
did it seem like you were climbing in altitude ?
going uphill ?
yeah , uphill
for no more than ten minutes and then we arrived .
can you hear the ocean ?
no .
no , i heard , uh , traffic ,
a freeway maybe in the distance .
i &apos;m sorry , is any of this helping ?
yeah , you &apos;re doing great .
so i got the tracking data from nakoa &apos;s p.o.
this is everywhere he &apos;s been
in the past 48 hours .
very busy guy .
yeah , right ?
now , the cars used in the kidnapping were stolen here and here .
any of these other locations could be the stash pad .
okay , well , we definitely
don &apos;t have time to check out all these places .
have hpd recon these locations , okay ,
and then tell &apos; em to keep their eyes open for buildings
big enough to hide a bus .
steve , one of the parents is here to see you .
okay , thank you .
the other parents asked me to come .
we know you &apos;ve received a ransom call ,
so what do the kidnappers want ?
mr. schafer , i can assure you that we have every resource
on the island working to bring your kids back .
how much did they ask for ?
i &apos;m afraid it &apos;s not that simple .
they have our kids and they want our money .
how much more simple can it be ?
if we thought that would work , we would do that .
is there something you &apos;re not telling me ?
mr. schafer ...
if it &apos;s not about the money ,
then what is it about ?
mr. schafer ,
listen ...
i know this is really hard
and i &apos;m sorry , but you &apos;re just going to have to trust us on this .
yeah .
jason ...
wanted me to take him surfing this morning .
he &apos;s just learning , it &apos;s all he can think about .
i told him i couldn &apos;t go .
i had to go into the office early .
i chose paperwork over my son because i assumed
i &apos;d have a thousand other mornings
where i could go surfing with him .
so , please , just g @-@ give them whatever they want
and bring my boy home .
everything will be fine , adam .
go back to new york ; you have a business to run .
extradition to japan .
is that really what you want ?
yes , i &apos;ll be safer there .
safe from what ?
you don &apos;t have to run .
i &apos;m afraid i do .
who is it ?
who &apos;s making you do this ?
yakuza ?
it &apos;s unimportant .
look , i made a promise
not to make my business yours .
now i need you to promise me the same .
going down ?
get in .
mr. noshimuri , don &apos;t make me ask you twice .
no ,
just your father .
it &apos;s okay .
lori , lori !
yeah , tracing it now .
danny .
this is mcgarrett .
you have my coke ?
i need proof the kids are okay .
that &apos;s not an answer .
we &apos;re not going to give you anything
until we know those kids are safe .
oh , you want proof ?
okay , i &apos;ll give you proof .
bring me one of them .
wait , what are you doing ?
you !
come on .
now !
let &apos;s go !
i think my dad knows that guy .
hey , what are you doing ? hey , hey .
okay , just stop . listen to me .
listen to me . don &apos;t do anything stupid , okay ?
we &apos;re right here .
you said you wanted proof the hostages were alive .
hear those screams ?
that &apos;s your proof .
i want my coke in a truck ,
lights flashing , headed north on kam highway .
one driver , no tails , no helicopters .
when i see you on the road , i &apos;ll call you .
you have one hour .
a second longer , and i shoot a kid .
do you understand ?
yes , i understand .
listen , hey , hey , hey ...
location ?
no , not enough time . she &apos;s bouncing the call
off four different towers .
it &apos;s on the windward side .
notify hpd , have them send all their people over
to that side of the island .
okay .
hey . i think we got something .
yeah , between nakoa &apos;s tracking data
and everything vargas remembered ,
we think we &apos;ve narrowed a location .
that &apos;s got to be where they &apos;re holding the kids .
what is at that location ?
it &apos;s at a warehouse .
it &apos;s an old cannery .
and it looks big enough to hide a bus .
all right , let &apos;s move , let &apos;s go .
that &apos;s the bus .
where are they ?
what is that ?
not sure .
who was sitting there ?
ms. christie . the teacher .
find anything ?
bunch of false @-@ bottom fish crates .
same ones the cartel used
to smuggle the drugs we found at the harbor .
all right , well , i found , uh , fresh motor oil over here .
i think they had a second vehicle .
we found a note tucked into the teacher &apos;s seat .
&quot; jason schafer remembers seeing
one of the kidnappers talking to his father . &quot;
schafer . isn &apos;t that the father that came to talk to you ?
yes . malcolm schafer .
how does schafer know one of the kidnappers ?
maybe he was the one who was targeted all along .
all right , hold on , hold on .
so the kidnappers have a beef with him ; i get it .
they take his kid , but why the rest of the class ?
chin , get everything you can on this guy .
all right , danny , you and kono go to the school , talk to him .
let &apos;s do it quick . we &apos;re running out of time .
where you going ?
i &apos;m gonna work on plan b.
where is this guy ?
he &apos;s not here .
what about his wife ?
over there .
mrs. schafer .
mrs. schafer , we need to speak to your husband .
do you know where he is ?
why ?
did something happen ?
is jason okay ?
mrs. schafer , we have reason to believe
that your son maybe recognized one of the kidnappers .
what ?
why ... how would my son know one of the kidnappers ?
that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to find out .
we think jason might have seen
this person with your husband .
if you can think of anything--
i don &apos;t know , maybe a business associate
that he might have recently had a conflict with ?
no , that &apos;s @-@ that &apos;s not possible .
mrs. schafer , what line of work is your husband in ?
he &apos;s in real estate .
okay , we need to speak to him now ,
so it &apos;d really be helpful if you could
tell us where he is .
uh , he got a phone call ,
he had to step away .
okay , when ?
a little while ago .
anything ?
no .
he &apos;s not here .
his kid &apos;s missing , everyone else is here ;
why would he leave ?
we need to run his phone , find out who he was talking to .
there &apos;s got to be another way . what about a decoy ?
no , sir , that won &apos;t work .
if they test the drugs at the drop ,
these kids are dead .
you can &apos;t tell me you have no other leads .
oh , we do have another lead , but we can &apos;t find him .
we &apos;re running out of time .
if i release those drugs and something goes wrong ,
that &apos;s $ 80 million in cocaine back on the streets .
sir , with all due respect , you &apos;re running out of options .
excuse me ?
these people have already shown that they &apos;re willing to kill .
if we don &apos;t negotiate , i believe they will not hesitate
to murder every person on that bus .
i agree with her , sir .
we just need the drugs as bait .
what makes you think if you deliver
they &apos;ll release the hostages ?
we don &apos;t .
but right now , it &apos;s the only way
we can buy enough time to find those kids .
danny and lori , you guys in position ?
in position .
i &apos;m two minutes out .
chin , how &apos;s the signal ?
tracker &apos;s up . loud and clear .
i &apos;m on the way .
where are the kids ?
you hold up your end , i &apos;ll hold up mine .
get off the highway .
head north on plantation road .
two miles up , there will be a white van .
put our drugs in the van and drive away .
i &apos;ll call you then with further instructions .
i got a positive id on the van .
find anything else ?
negative .
it &apos;s all clear here .
i &apos;m heading to the van now .
all right .
i &apos;m heading back .
hold on , steve .
there &apos;s something &apos;s wrong with the tracking signal .
picking up some sort of interference .
you see any radio towers in the area ?
no .
no , there &apos;s nothing here but the van .
something &apos;s not right .
get out of there now .
you okay ?
what the hell happened ?
they rigged the van .
they give you the kids &apos; location ?
no .
i don &apos;t get it .
i mean , we gave them what they wanted .
why blow up their own drugs ?
hold on , maybe somebody else rigged the van .
no , they did it . and they didn &apos;t just
blow up the drugs , they blew up our evidence .
destroying evidence makes sense if we have
a high @-@ value suspect in custody .
but that bust we made at the docks ,
we didn &apos;t get anybody worth this much trouble .
or did we ?
who , vargas ?
no , he &apos;s low @-@ level security for the cartel .
maybe he &apos;s not .
where are the kids , man ?
i told you ,
i don &apos;t know nothing about no bus or no kids .
listen to me .
nobody blows up $ 80 million worth of cocaine
to save the schmuck that sits in the back of the van .
hey , where are the kids ? !
come on !
we &apos;re done here ! where are they ? !
you &apos;re saying that the drugs are gone ?
then you got no case against me .
damn .
that &apos;s not good for you .
well , now there &apos;s no way you &apos;re getting those kids back .
you &apos;re castillo .
to be fair , i did warn you .
castillo is ruthless .
go ahead .
go ahead .
where are the kids ?
i promise you , i promise you , you are not leaving this room
until you tell us where those kids are .
tell you what . i don &apos;t think that &apos;s true .
i think my lawyer &apos;s coming here to get me out .
i think i &apos;m done answering questions for today .
i think i &apos;m going home .
gonna go see my boys .
boys ?
yeah .
you said you had girls . said you had three girls .
i did say that , didn &apos;t i ?
must have been mistaken .
yeah .
let me talk to him for one second .
just one second .
get up ! get up !
let me tell you something .
look at me .
yeah .
i don &apos;t care who you are .
i don &apos;t care if you &apos;re vargas or castillo ;
we don &apos;t get those kids back ,
there &apos;s gonna be a toe tag hanging off your foot
that &apos;s gonna say &quot; john doe . &quot;
we &apos;ll see .
kids , don &apos;t look at that . look at me .
someone &apos;s going to find us .
we &apos;re going to be okay , all right ?
what is this ?
open !
hey , guys .
i got something .
remember that anonymous tip we got three days ago ?
yeah .
it was schafer .
what are you talking about ?
the call that led to the drug bust ,
it came from a pay phone on the north shore right across
the street from schafer &apos;s office .
so i ran a voice analysis ,
comparing the call with schafer &apos;s outgoing voice mail message .
a large shipment of cocaine will be arriving tonight .
it &apos;s a match .
wait .
why does schafer know about a drug shipment ?
because he &apos;s in business with castillo .
he &apos;s got a shell company he &apos;s been using
to lease out one of his properties
to the cartel as a stash pad .
