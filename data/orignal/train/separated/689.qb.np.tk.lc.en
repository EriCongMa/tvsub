that &apos;s alison stoddard .
what the hell is conrad doing with the governor &apos;s wife ?
carrion has the ability to knock manhattan
off the power grid
in less than a millisecond .
pose for the camera .
feel like putting on a show ?
i assume you &apos;ve kept your personnel files of all your employees ?
i was wondering if i could look over mathis &apos; .
daniel &apos;s growing suspicious of your past .
are you denying that you abandoned a 6 @-@ month @-@ old boy ?
the story is true .
help me find my firstborn son .
and in return ?
sole owner of nolcorp .
i can &apos;t go head to head with the falc0n .
he &apos;s the best there is .
falc0n ?
check your in @-@ box .
you &apos;ve messed with the wrong person !
i wanna spend the rest of my life with you ,
and only if you want the same .
engagement can be a commitment to love ...
or a declaration of war .
one must enter every battle without hesitation ,
willing to fully engage the enemy ...
till death do you part .
emily ?
when you said you were bringing me dinner at the office ...
well , i wanted to do something a little bit more private ,
less ... in the limelight .
you look beautiful .
thank you .
le blanc ou le rouge ?
red .
i know that devilish grin of yours .
what are you up to ?
well , i &apos;ve been thinking about what you said .
have a look .
last year , my biggest regret
was not getting on that plane with you .
i just hope it &apos;s not too late to say &quot; yes . &quot;
to paris ?
to us .
to us .
thought you went to school .
charlotte flaked on me again . she was supposed to drive me .
does it have anything to do with that paparazzi video of her with that girl ?
why didn &apos;t you talk to me about it , man ?
i gotta hear about it from a group of barflies ?
what &apos;s going on ?
she &apos;s in a really dark place , and she &apos;s--
she has been ever since amanda ...
she into drugs again ?
i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t know . maybe .
it &apos;s pretty hard for me to tell
with her blowing me off every day .
what are you ...
i need money for bus fare .
how many buses are you taking ?
are you gonna drive me ?
ashley &apos;s on her way over .
did she find out anything ? i mean , is , uh ...
conrad screwing the governor &apos;s wife ?
i &apos;ll know soon enough .
whatever he &apos;s up to , there &apos;s no way
i &apos;m gonna let him slither his way into the governor &apos;s mansion .
hey , do you know why
you &apos;re supposed to bury a politician 100 feet down ?
&apos;cause deep down , they &apos;re really good people .
tell me , conrad ,
what is your true intention ?
&apos;cause i know that you wouldn &apos;t sacrifice
an asset as valuable as nolcorp
out of the goodness of your heart .
well , with the initiative
and their sizable business out of the picture ,
paring down is what &apos;s best for the company .
mm . and if it promises to hasten
the recovery of your long @-@ lost son ,
all the better , yes ?
forgive me if i find this sudden generosity
rings about as true as one of your campaign promises .
speaking of broken promises ...
34 more letters today .
it seems that every orphan born in &apos; 73
is trying to lay dubious claim to the throne .
but what are the chances that your real son is in this mix ?
also dubious .
call it a mother &apos;s intuition .
well , best of luck to mr. ross then ,
as he chases down your wild goose .
ah . perfect timing .
this is the nolcorp transfer agreement .
now i know it was your first acquisition ,
so letting it go may be--
if i weren &apos;t good with it ,
i would have vetoed the board &apos;s decision .
daniel , can i steal a moment with you ?
unless , like your sister ,
you &apos;re still giving me the cold shoulder over the news .
mother , i &apos;m neither upset nor surprised
that you have yet another kid out there .
bite your tongue . i think you know how that happened .
and since we &apos;re making new additions to the family ...
you remember my fiancee .
emily and i are re @-@ engaged .
allow me to offer our congratulations .
oh , why , thank you , conrad .
yes .
how ... repetitious .
we &apos;re hosting a party tonight to share the good news .
well , i can only hope that you opt for
a very long engagement this time .
actually , quite the opposite .
in two weeks , daniel and i take off to paris .
that &apos;s where you &apos;re getting married ?
no .
that &apos;s where we &apos;re planning to live .
really , daniel ?
your first engagement to emily was a disaster .
what difference will paris make ?
emily &apos;s the one , all right ?
if you don &apos;t support me , then fine .
but i &apos;m not letting her get away again .
besides , i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll find my replacement
before the week &apos;s out .
don &apos;t be cruel , daniel .
you and i have both made mistakes .
the difference is , i don &apos;t make them twice .
except bastard children , i guess .
thank you .
well , between you and me , daniel , i &apos;m thrilled .
you always did have a soft spot for emily ,
or at least her bank accounts .
oh , why wouldn &apos;t i ?
i &apos;ve always wished a stable future for you ,
plus if you were to rush an announcement into the &quot; times , &quot;
i predict a bump in the polls .
you know what ? you can milk our engagement all you like .
but in return ,
i want my trust fund withdrawn
from the amanda clarke foundation .
since the initiative &apos;s pulled out of the company ,
there &apos;s no reason to be hiding our assets anymore .
well , perhaps ,
but your money &apos;s securely gaining remarkable interest
right where it is ,
right along with the rest of the family fortune .
i don &apos;t care . i want all my ducks in a row
by the time i step away from grayson global .
and when you say au revoir ,
what exactly do you plan to do , nibble croissants
and jet around the world for the next 50 years ?
i can certainly see this girl &apos;s
burrowed into your heart , hasn &apos;t she ?
oh , she &apos;s been there since the day i met her .
yeah . i recognize the symptoms .
okay , but at least wait
to announce your departure from the company ...
until after--
after the election , i get it .
grace , you read my mind .
hey , contact &quot; huffpo , &quot; will you ?
get an engagement announcement on the home page .
already on it .
and i have a delivery from takeda industries .
it &apos;s aiden mathis &apos; employee records .
should i messenger it to the house ?
no . i &apos;m on my way in .
word is buzzing around the office .
i believe congratulations are in order .
you think i called you here
to break the news that i &apos;m marrying emily ,
make sure there &apos;s no hard feelings ?
you know , when i hired you ,
i had h.r. do an extensive background check .
came back squeaky clean .
so what did you do ,
pay them off , hack the system to erase your file ?
no , of course i didn &apos;t . why ?
all right , so why am i only now learning
that your father was trevor mathis ,
the baggage handler
suspected of putting a bomb on flight 197 ?
because that is not information that i am comfortable with--
with sharing , daniel .
you don &apos;t understand the things that i have--
help me to ,
because it can &apos;t be coincidence that you took a job here ,
given grayson global &apos;s complicated connection
to that flight , to david clarke .
they were the sins of my father , not mine .
and you of all people should understand that !
we have nothing in common , mathis .
i thought you were just after my job , or emily .
but it was always more than that , wasn &apos;t it ?
that &apos;s why you targeted trask &apos;s funds .
you were trying to get back at them .
who &apos;s &quot; them &quot; ?
what d--what does trask have to do with anything ?
security &apos;s gonna come up and escort you off the premises .
needless to say , you &apos;re fired .
somebody is clearly trying to manipulate you against me .
look , just--just tell me who it is .
someone i trust far more than you .
okay .
jack , i &apos;m working .
actually , that ...
was mine .
so what &apos;d you find out ?
you will be happy to know
i &apos;m back in conrad &apos;s good graces ,
thanks to your photography skills .
but as to the nature of his relationship with mrs. stoddard ,
i &apos;m afraid i didn &apos;t glean much .
okay , well , then let &apos;s just
go to the press with the photo , put it out there .
let the voters draw their own conclusions .
i &apos;m not convinced that this picture is enough
to derail conrad &apos;s campaign .
time &apos;s running out . i gotta do something .
i have a suggestion ,
but it comes with its own set of risks .
what are we talking about ?
how brave are you , jack ?
i always did love this ring .
well , we thought about keeping it a secret ,
but with all the press surrounding the family right now--
ugh . don &apos;t talk to me about overexposure .
you saw the video of me and my friend regina .
yes , i did . what were you thinking ?
i wasn &apos;t .
i keep wishing amanda were here .
she &apos;d know what i was going through .
um , not with the press . i just mean ...
it &apos;s a sister thing .
never mind .
yeah .
look , i know you miss her .
she can never be replaced .
but we &apos;re gonna be sisters soon , too .
and i &apos;m hoping that ...
you &apos;ll be more a part of my life .
which is why i &apos;m here .
i was wondering if you would be my maid of honor .
that is , if you &apos;ll leave this room long enough to come to paris .
oh , my god , emily . of course .
yeah ?
hate to interrupt this hallmark moment .
you must be regina .
which means you must be a user of the internet .
bad time , charlie ?
um , i was just leaving .
we &apos;ll talk more at the party tonight .
thanks , emily .
bye .
any luck ?
the guy who sold it to me didn &apos;t buy
the whole &quot; for a friend &quot; bit .
sorry , but given my history ,
and now with the tabloids following me everywhere ...
i got your back .
如果你愿意见我 我只想和你谈谈
how disgraceful .
all of these people
trying to capitalize on your pain .
emily , dear , that extravagant ring on your finger
does not give you permission to flit in and out of my house without good reason .
i was here asking charlotte to be my maid of honor .
she &apos;s really so excited to see paris .
she &apos;s already seen it , multiple times .
i would assume that you of all people
would appreciate the city of lights , victoria .
after all , isn &apos;t that where you attended art school
all of those years ago ?
sorry to interrupt .
am i early ?
mr. porter , of course . we have an appointment .
your timing is perfect because emily is just leaving .
right this way .
shall we ?
we can speak privately in here .
good @-@ bye , emily .
i hope you know
i appreciate what you &apos;ve done for my family ,
with the foundation , taking us under your wing .
which is why i ...
i think you should see this .
it &apos;s conrad with governor stoddard &apos;s wife .
and it certainly didn &apos;t look like
the first time he &apos;d met with her .
why are you showing me this ?
why not just approach my husband ?
i &apos;m just trying to protect the campaign ,
and no one has a better chance of getting through to conrad than you .
that photo has the power to derail him .
i don &apos;t mean to imply anything , but--
don &apos;t worry , jack .
my husband does a fine job of implicating himself .
i &apos;ll handle this .
all right .
they say politics makes for strange bedfellows .
and folks tend to jump to conclusions
when they see two people who are supposed to be enemies
acting like friends .
the opposite of you and emily thorne .
you used to be very close , right ?
i couldn &apos;t help but notice a chill in your friendship .
did she tell you that she &apos;s re @-@ engaged to my son ?
i can &apos;t say i &apos;m surprised .
yes , well ...
i don &apos;t imagine you &apos;ll be receiving an invitation
to the engagement party tonight ,
seeing as your tryst with her
was the reason they broke it off the first time .
oh , didn &apos;t you know that ?
oh , jack , my apologies .
it was one thing when he was working for conrad ,
but what business would jack have with victoria ?
maybe he wants her recipe for devil &apos;s food cake .
i &apos;m serious , nolan .
if i don &apos;t know what he &apos;s up to ,
how am i gonna do anything about it ?
you realize you can &apos;t protect jack forever , don &apos;t you ?
i made a promise to amanda , and i plan to keep it .
i have to go .
nothing like a little retail therapy .
sounds beautiful .
where are you off to ?
i &apos;m taking eeyore out to buck her up .
promise not to make any more headlines .
can i have a minute with my sister ?
look ...
i just wanted to say , you don &apos;t have to be embarrassed
about what happened outside that club .
all right ? not around me .
don &apos;t try to commiserate .
you have no idea what i &apos;m going through .
sure , i do . i @-@ i &apos;ve been through
a rough patch of my own when i was your age .
hey , you--you &apos;re gonna be
at our engagement party later , right ?
sorry . i can &apos;t be around mom right now .
and i &apos;m sure you understand ,
or you wouldn &apos;t be moving to france .
but good luck tonight .
and this year , try not to shoot anyone .
hello , alison .
were you expecting your husband ...
or mine ?
i understand you two have been seeing each other .
are you trying to ensure that you stay
in the governor &apos;s mansion ,
regardless of the outcome ?
no , victoria . you &apos;ve misunderstood .
all i want is to move out of it .
out ?
i have no interest in your husband ,
only my own .
when conrad entered the race
as the only viable challenger to my husband &apos;s office ,
i asked for a meeting .
and just like that , his poll numbers magically began to rise .
and my husband &apos;s began to fall .
are you saying that you &apos;ve been sabotaging his campaign ?
i &apos;m feeding conrad information .
leaking strategies ,
my husband &apos;s attack ads before they air--
anything to give conrad an edge .
now what could this man have possibly done
to drive you to destroy a 30 @-@ year career in politics ?
mark has a degenerative heart condition .
his private doctor says ,
well , he won &apos;t survive another term as governor .
maybe not even survive the year .
well , why collude with conrad ?
why not go straight to the press ?
no , mark would never forgive me .
living the life mark leads--
endless nights at the office ,
gone weeks at a time--
every time i say good @-@ bye to him ,
i have no idea if it &apos;ll be for the last time .
it sounds excruciating .
please ... listen to me .
if conrad wins , if you love him ,
limit him to one term .
this job is a practical death sentence .
slightly unsettling--
a freshly fired grayson employee
lurking the halls of a subsidiary .
trust me , if i could be anywhere else , i would be .
mm . i need your help .
fret not .
after the requisite rubber stamps ,
nolcorp can remove the grayson noose ,
and i can resume hiring .
you could be my bodyguard
and ... i could be your whitney .
i &apos;m not looking for a job , nolan .
that &apos;s not what i heard .
look , you &apos;re gonna need something to do
while emily finishes her end game .
there is no end game for emily .
what are you talking about ?
all these years of training , trying to focus my anger ...
i always thought when i avenged my father and sister
that i &apos;d get some kind of ...
peace or ... closure , whatever that is .
well , you must have felt something
when you killed trask .
i felt empty .
wait .
are you saying
you want emily to just give up her mission ?
because you were the one that told me ,
take revenge away from emily , and we will lose her forever .
but i know better now .
that &apos;s something that her father knew all along
and ... you , too , i suspect .
hypothetically ...
where would we start ?
when daniel &apos;s parents learn about my background ,
they &apos;re gonna remove me as treasurer of the foundation .
we need to drain the account before that happens .
it &apos;s impossible .
the falcon created an unhackable bank account .
not even carrion could break the code .
i never said that it was gonna be easy ,
only that i need your help .
more importantly , that emily does .
now can i count on you or not ?
did we have a playdate scheduled ?
here &apos;s the deal , edith .
i need answers fast ,
and you need a get @-@ out @-@ of @-@ jail @-@ free card .
so ... play ball ,
and i &apos;ll erase the cyber trail that got you indicted .
i &apos;m listening .
where is victoria grayson &apos;s first son patrick ?
she claims that you erased all traces of him
in some grand extortion plot .
bitch would spin it that way .
roundabout the time , the whole david clarke thing was going down ,
little teenage patrick harper hopped a bus from cleveland
in search of his birth mother .
when victoria caught wind of it ,
she had her henchman pay the kid 5 mil to disappear .
she then employed me to eliminate
all digital traces of his original identity .
she &apos;s playing you .
any chance you ...
kept that file in a ... blackmail bank ?
no , unfortunately .
sorry it &apos;s not the answer you wanted ,
but i believe we had a deal .
not quite yet .
what is the initiative planning to do with carrion ?
don &apos;t know . don &apos;t care .
after i validated it ,
i tweaked your code for a little insurance .
carrion can &apos;t operate without my magic touch ,
which means either you get me out of here
or they will .
just a question of who wants it more .
we done here ?
ah , almost .
how do i access the amanda clarke foundation account ?
since you like games so much ,
you &apos;ll find it in a place i was born ,
if not made .
an old favorite , hiding in plain sight .
i &apos;m mark stoddard ,
and i approve this message .
conrad grayson has proven
that he &apos;s a wealthy man from wall street
who &apos;s out of touch with main street .
what &apos;s that ?
he &apos;s more concerned with private planes
than he is with public transportation ...
he certainly managed to capture your essence .
it &apos;s my opponent &apos;s newest attack ad .
conrad grayson-- bad for new york .
and how , may i ask ,
did you get it before it &apos;s been broadcast ?
well , that &apos;s not important .
your job now is to neutralize it .
ah , mr. porter ,
just think . now in two days ,
you &apos;re gonna be able to get back to your life
and begin figuring out
an appropriate bonus for all your efforts .
keep your campaign promises , and i &apos;m good .
well , let &apos;s hope the voters
don &apos;t hold me to so high a standard .
i did what we talked about .
i showed that picture to victoria .
but after all the horrible things that woman did to amanda ,
i don &apos;t trust her as far as i can throw her .
if anyone &apos;s more committed to his defeat than us ,
it &apos;s her .
she &apos;s got a track record for keeping her men
exactly where she wants them .
including daniel , apparently .
she told me i was the reason
he and emily broke up last year .
that &apos;s because you were .
you know , jack , we &apos;re friends now ,
so i feel like i should just tell you .
right before emily gave him back the ring ,
i saw the two of you at her house kissing ,
and i told daniel .
why would you do that ?
she was engaged to a man that i had feelings for
while she clearly had feelings for you .
she always seems to get what she wants .
people like them always do .
not him . not this time .
i &apos;m so glad you could all join us tonight
to once again celebrate the engagement of daniel to emily .
as the old saying goes , if at first you don &apos;t succeed ,
try , try again .
oh , it &apos;s every mother &apos;s dream
to have her son marry the girl next door ,
and daniel certainly hasn &apos;t disappointed me .
emily &apos;s been a part of our lives for over a year now .
and even when they were apart , she never really left us .
so welcome to the family , emily .
to daniel and emily .
hear , hear .
and i look forward to getting to know you better ...
with each passing day .
starting now , if you &apos;ll indulge me in a little chat .
how could i say no ?
well , here we are ...
that impressive ring once again on your finger ,
ready to spirit my son away to europe .
paris was daniel &apos;s idea , victoria .
oh , emily . i was not born yesterday .
i know more than anyone just how ...
susceptible my son can be .
we couldn &apos;t be happier .
of course , there are certain things we need to work out .
i want two children . daniel &apos;s lobbying for three .
either way , you &apos;ll make a terrific grandmother , victoria .
and we &apos;ll put a picture up
so that they can see you .
i know what a woman in love looks like ,
and that &apos;s not you .
not one year ago , and not today .
i understand why you &apos;re on edge , victoria ...
especially here tonight .
i can &apos;t imagine how difficult it must be for you
to spend time in david clarke &apos;s old house ...
on the very swing that ...
amanda told me he built for her .
the memories of love and betrayal that must flood in .
i &apos;ll give you a moment since you so clearly need one .
oh , god . you &apos;re gonna be fine .
you just need some air to breathe .
charlotte . hey , charlotte . hey , charlotte .
move it . excuse me .
declan . what are you doing here ?
you wouldn &apos;t answer your phone .
i figured you &apos;d be here .
stalker .
please don &apos;t be mad at me .
i &apos;m not mad at you . i &apos;m worried .
i &apos;m fine . i ... just ...
great . she sees you , she pukes .
shut up . guys , enough . come on . she &apos;s sick .
hey , charlotte , come on . we gotta go .
come on . come here .
had a little too much to drink , young lady ?
i &apos;m not drunk .
you &apos;re not 21 either .
she &apos;s fine . i &apos;m gonna take her home .
charlotte , come on .
charlotte grayson , right ?
one of you might want to call daddy warbucks ,
tell him his princess is being booked downtown .
let go of me .
hey , guys , come on .
what ?
are you all right ?
you seem a million miles away .
i fired aiden today .
but i thought he was your insurance policy
in case something went wrong .
i found out that his father was the one
who put that bomb on flight 1 @-@ 9 @-@ 7,
a fact that he went to great lengths to conceal .
where did you get this information ?
well , his ex @-@ employer sent me his personnel file .
takeda ?
yeah .
darling . could we have a word ?
go ahead .
yes , of course .
well , i wanted to apologize for my reaction to the news .
i &apos;m afraid i just couldn &apos;t mask my surprise .
i think you mean judgment .
oh , silly .
so i have here a check for the funds you requested , in full .
well , thanks very much . we appreciate that , dad .
thank you so much for your support , conrad .
you know , there is still time
for you to heed your old man &apos;s advice ,
leave this right where it is .
i know what i &apos;m doing .
and if you know what you &apos;re doing ,
you &apos;ll take mathis off the a.c.f. account
before the foreign banks open tomorrow .
believe me , he &apos;s not to be trusted .
how could you do this ?
by exposing aiden , you &apos;ve put both of us at risk .
the boy has put you at risk .
careless , undisciplined ...
i should never have let him come to you .
but you did let him come .
and now everything that i &apos;ve been working for is in danger .
only if you &apos;re too weak to do what needs to be done .
have you forgotten what your enemies have stolen ?
it &apos;s all i think about . you know that .
then remember this -- the path you walk
is for you ... alone .
even now , those who destroyed your father ...
are planning a second strike .
what do you think they are gonna do ?
what they always do .
create fear , chaos ...
profit .
and you &apos;re here to stop them , aren &apos;t you ?
takeda , tell me what you know .
let me help you .
let aiden help .
no .
this path is mine alone .
so it &apos;s true ?
you &apos;re really gonna marry daniel ?
i am .
what &apos;s different this time around ?
what do you mean ?
i mean , last time you were willing to break it off over one kiss .
i don &apos;t understand why you didn &apos;t talk to me about it .
i tried to tell you , jack .
but then amanda was there , and she was pregnant ...
and suddenly , you had this whole new life ahead of you .
not anymore .
be careful of victoria , jack .
she manipulates whenever it serves her ,
and she doesn &apos;t do anything freely .
you think i don &apos;t know that ?
i was married to amanda .
and you were supposed to be her best friend .
how could you agree to marry into a family
that we both know ruined her life ?
i wish i could explain it to you .
and someday , i will .
emily ...
i am so tired of all the secrets and the half @-@ truths .
it &apos;s always &quot; someday &quot; with you .
you should go be with your new family .
i didn &apos;t know jack was on the guest list .
he wasn &apos;t .
god , this is such a mess .
tell me what i missed .
takeda told daniel about aiden &apos;s father .
yeesh . bad teacher .
he claims that the initiative &apos;s plan is imminent .
well , not as long as the falcon &apos;s
computer privileges are suspended .
carrion can &apos;t operate without her keystrokes .
and i got that straight from the bird &apos;s mouth .
you saw her ?
well , get this--
patrick came a @-@ knockin &apos; in the early &apos; 90s .
victoria paid him 5 million smackers to disappear .
so either he &apos;s grateful for the buyout
or he &apos;s furious for the double abandonment .
what else did you find ?
well , the falcon &apos;s done parroting until i solve her riddle .
she says the answers i want lie in the place
that she was born if not made .
she grew up in jersey .
i &apos;ve searched everything from sinatra to snookie .
no love .
charlotte just called .
i gotta bail her out of jail .
jail ?
yeah , some cop looking for his 15 minutes
snagged her at a club downtown .
i gotta find out what his price is .
well , let me come with you .
no , no , i need you to hold down the fort .
i gotta get her home before my parents catch wind of this .
the last thing she needs
is a lecture from those two model citizens .
i &apos;m so sorry . all right ?
i &apos;m gonna call you from the car .
you know , sometimes he actually seems like a decent guy .
you know i &apos;m with aiden now .
no matter what ?
i think i made it clear who i &apos;m fighting for .
wait . that &apos;s it .
that--that is the answer to the riddle .
uh , i &apos;ll explain to you when i get back .
they want 3 grand for charlotte &apos;s bail .
we just need to hit a few atms .
must be real nice having all that cash ready and waiting for you .
is that why charlotte likes you ?
&apos;cause i know it &apos;s not your personality .
maybe because i &apos;m there for her without being super judgey .
right . &apos; cause you &apos;ve known her for what , five minutes ?
you don &apos;t know anything about her or me , for that matter .
my loss , i &apos;m sure .
i figured out the falcon &apos;s riddle .
the entry code is a numeric passkey .
her high score on &quot; street fighter . &quot;
great . well , let &apos;s just hope we haven &apos;t run out of time to use it .
uh , yeah , about that--
we really need to bring emily into the loop .
look , i thought we agreed to keep her out of it .
well , that was before i found out
about takeda &apos;s november surprise on you .
it &apos;s a sub @-@ zero world
when your own sensei stabs you in the back .
i &apos;ve gotta go .
your lack of restraint has proved to be your undoing .
you &apos;re being shortsighted . i came here to help emily .
you failed . your mission is over .
my mission is over when i &apos;m with emily .
you let us both go , and i promise
she &apos;ll never learn about your true objective .
try to stop me , and she learns the truth tonight .
you were never gonna let us go , were you ?
some paths are chosen .
some are chosen for us .
you were a soldier .
not a warrior .
this is where your path ends .
what &apos;s going on , charlotte ?
kissing girls , getting arrested-- that &apos;s not you .
i &apos;m just tired of the way
mom and dad ruin everything and everyone .
and the last thing i want
is to bring someone else into this family for them to hurt .
yeah , our other brother &apos;s better off staying far away .
i &apos;m not talking about him .
daniel , i &apos;m pregnant .
州长夫人揭露健康秘密
we just received a startling tape
that is sure to have a major impact
on the new york gubernatorial campaign .
mark has a degenerative heart condition .
his private doctor says ...
he won &apos;t survive another term as governor .
maybe not even survive the year ...
my husband is peerless when it comes to skullduggery .
i confronted him with the photos ,
and he spins it into this . ...
impossible stress .
oh , a brandy would be lovely .
let &apos;s put our cards on the table , jack .
i know you don &apos;t like me , and you hold me responsible
for things that happened to your late wife .
but i also know that you want to destroy my husband &apos;s campaign ,
as do i.
and that was your aim when you brought me that photo , right ?
thank you .
i &apos;ve been married to that scoundrel for 26 years ,
and i have innumerable reasons for wanting to see him fail .
but what i don &apos;t know is why you do .
he ordered my wife &apos;s murder .
that &apos;s a serious accusation .
do you have proof ?
nothing that would hold up in court ,
or he &apos;d be in jail right now .
let me be the judge of that .
we &apos;re not talking about the porters , are we ?
okay , look , let &apos;s say somebody
was able to remove this leverage you &apos;re talking about .
is the deal back on ?
as it stands , mr. ryan ,
that &apos;s a purely hypothetical question .
we never had this conversation .
are we in ?
says the man who &apos;s 30 minutes late .
the sooner we drain the graysons &apos; funds ,
the sooner i can convince emily to leave with me .
well , i &apos;ve overwritten the falcon &apos;s security block .
now all i need is your admin code , mr. treasurer .
assuming grayson i.t.
hasn &apos;t pulled you off the account yet .
okay .
decision time , mate .
you hit &quot; enter , &quot; and that bank account zeroes out .
and the graysons are left with nothing .
so this is why you wanted to solve the falcon &apos;s riddle--
to bankrupt the graysons .
aiden , we &apos;re not ready for this .
on the contrary .
there &apos;s no more time to lose .
aiden , don &apos;t !
the recent revelation of governor stoddard &apos;s heart condition
has sent shock waves throughout the state ,
and with new yorkers headed to the polls in a matter of days ,
the news almost ensures a victory
for challenger conrad grayson ...
incredible .
two days from now , you &apos;ll be governor of new york . ...
well , i &apos;ll drink to that .
hear .
it--it &apos;s done . the graysons are bankrupt .
what happened ? where did the money go ?
in an account so secret , not even the falcon can find it .
tell me you didn &apos;t use your administration code to gain access .
the graysons will know it was you .
that makes $ 3,000 .
let &apos;s go get my girl .
she is not your girl , regina .
the door &apos;s jammed .
what the hell ?
it &apos;s a blackout .
the whole city &apos;s out .
that &apos;s impossible .
manhattan runs off several independent power grids .
carrion .
it &apos;s started .
