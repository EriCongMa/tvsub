gossip girl here--
your one and only source into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
the moment i met you , i &apos;ve been falling for you .
why don &apos;t you just tell dan about her ?
cause she has that tape of me , and she &apos;ll use it .
you held a certain fascination when you were beautiful .
i don &apos;t want you anymore .
eventually the two of you are gonna have to work out your issues .
what if i told you i knew where georgina sparks was ?
i &apos;d say let &apos;s get the bitch. thank god you called .
i &apos;m here looking for you right now. where are you ? with me .
what are you gonna do ? it &apos;s not what i &apos;m gonna do .
it &apos;s who i &apos;m gonna do it with .
the drugs were dad &apos;s. your father is facing some other charges .
would you do me the honor of being my wife ?
he proposed before we left , and i &apos;m going to say &quot; yes . &quot;
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll make a beautiful bride .
you don &apos;t mind missing the after party ?
there &apos;s no place i &apos;d rather be .
and who am i ?
that &apos;s a secret i &apos;ll never tell .
you know you love me .
x.o.x.o. , gossip girl .
hey , dan . i &apos;ve been trying to reach you all night .
i know it &apos;s early , or late , if you haven &apos;t slept , like me , but , um ,
i &apos;m pretty sure after this message ,
i will have officially filled your voice mail , so i , uh ...
i @-@ i &apos;m coming over .
hello ?
who is it ?
hello. yeah , this is rufus .
i &apos;d have to check with the guys , but i &apos;m pretty sure we &apos;re available .
yeah , okay .
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
what ? i just got the call .
lincoln hawk is hitting the road .
we &apos;re opening for the breeders .
i guess that luscious jackson reunion didn &apos;t work out .
wait. what was your &quot; oh , my god &quot; ?
oh , nothing. nothing at all .
it &apos;s day , as in , uh , as in wedding day , as in , uh ... my wedding day .
right .
but , uh , congratulations .
thanks .
no , thank you , uh , for last night. it was , uh--- amazing .
it &apos;s bart.
that &apos;s what i was afraid of .
do you want me to answer it ? do you want me to kill you ?
no , i know. um ...
that &apos;s because we &apos;re not supposed to
see each other on the day of the wedding .
okay. that &apos;s fine . i &apos;ll meet you in an hour .
i don &apos;t know what bart wants , but i have to go , um , talk to him .
what about ? any topics in particular ?
well , i &apos;m sure i &apos;ll think of something .
who ? what ? when ? where ? why ?
we were up late plotting against georgina .
we must have dozed off. and you were on the floor .
i didn &apos;t want to hurt my back .
why ? it &apos;s not like you ever do anything athletic .
well , that &apos;s not entirely true , now is it ?
fine. nothing that requires you removing your scarf .
that was one time. it was chilly. enough about the past .
before you landed in my bed , we actually landed on a good idea .
well , i trust you can take it from here .
i have a best man speech to write and no time to write it .
don &apos;t worry . i can be bitch enough for both of us .
i still got the scars on my back to prove it .
you know , they say if you love something , you should set it free. ugh .
they say when you hate something , you should slam the door in its face .
i love it when you talk dir-- wow !
a stint in rehab sure didn &apos;t slow you down a bit , huh ?
i haven &apos;t felt this good in years .
clean and sober. lawyer &apos;s feeling great about the trial .
nice .
well , sometimes things just work out , huh ?
sometimes they do .
we can celebrate tonight at the wedding .
when &apos;s , uh , when &apos;s mom getting back from the hamptons ?
she &apos;s not gonna make it .
the landscapers royally screwed up the yard .
apparently , all our shrubs look like circus bears .
she &apos;s gonna miss the wedding to deal with that ?
that , and , uh , the leak we had in the basement .
place is a mess .
i just , um , was kinda hoping both you guys could meet vanessa .
oh , right. right . i forgot you had a date .
well , you and i can just hang till then .
the yankees are on today .
joba &apos;s pitching lights out right now. all right. sounds good .
i gotta take this .
it &apos;s my sponsor .
oh , sorry. um , i &apos;ll just see you at home then .
hey , it &apos;s me .
yes , yes. everything is discussed .
don &apos;t be late. don &apos;t be early .
i &apos;ll slip out right after the ceremony .
just be there , waiting .
i &apos;m sorry . i know it &apos;s early , but i couldn &apos;t sleep .
i had to see you , and you &apos;re here , which means you slept here ,
which is a relief , but not a surprise . serena .
but that is surprising .
they say love conquers all , but maybe love never met georgina sparks .
poor humphrey .
looks like our resident moral compass
isn &apos;t such a straight arrow after all .
serena , i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry .
the way dan was talking , i thought it was over. over ?
maybe not exactly &quot; over , &quot; but-- i should go .
this is not what i had planned .
no , i think it &apos;s exactly what you had planned .
serena , this is not sarah &apos;s fault .
no , it &apos;s georgina &apos;s ! whatever .
i never meant to get in between you two , i swear .
hey , please. it &apos;s okay .
no , it &apos;s not , because now she &apos;s upset .
yeah , i am , you manipulative psycho bitch !
whoa ! whoa ! what are you doing ?
serena ! you have been planning this the whole time !
she &apos;s lying to you , dan !
good @-@ bye , dan .
i am telling him everything .
tell me what ?
what is it that you need to tell me ?
so my mom took me to see his parents , and after talking to them ,
all i wanted was to come and find you and tell you everything .
do you hate me ?
no. no , no , of course not .
it &apos;s--it &apos;s just ...
it &apos;s , uh , it &apos;s a lot .
and i ...
i really , really wish that you told me this sooner .
no , i @-@ i know it &apos;s my fault .
i ... i was just so scared .
i @-@ i get it . i get it .
i mean , &quot; hey , i think i killed someone ,
&quot; and i &apos;m being blackmailed by a crazy girl pretending to be someone else &quot;
doesn &apos;t quite roll off the tongue .
but it &apos;s all over , right ?
i mean , we can fix this .
serena , i--last night-- it &apos;s okay .
you and georgina and vanessa were just hanging out , and it got late ,
and you fell asleep .
i &apos;ll see you at the wedding .
when i told my mom not to go away with rufus ,
i said it was &apos; cause you and i were forever .
i knew i was right .
hello ?
blair , it &apos;s dan .
bart , darling .
what is the big mystery ?
what are we doing here ?
this is the first building i ever bought .
well , it &apos;s quite impressive .
you had a good eye even--even back then .
sometimes i like to come here , just to ...
feel how it felt the first time i saw it .
well , there is a comfort in revisiting the things that we loved ...
when we were young .
but the truth is , i &apos;m not that young man anymore .
i think maybe i &apos;ve outgrown this place ,
and holding on to it is keeping me from
moving forward with what &apos;s most important to me now .
what do you think i should do ?
i think you should let it go .
i agree .
now can you do the same for me ?
hey , it &apos;s sarah. you know what to do .
voice mail .
okay , like we talked about .
hey , hey , it &apos;s me . dan .
after you left , serena and i got in a huge fight ,
and--and she said all this crazy stuff .
i honestly don &apos;t know what to believe ,
but--but what i do know is i want to see you .
so , uh , call me .
excellent work. she &apos;s totally calling back .
this is so weird .
i don &apos;t normally do plots against people .
don &apos;t worry , virgin . i &apos;ll talk you through it .
right on schedule .
hey . i just got your message .
oh , good , good .
so ... sorry about this morning with serena .
that was very awkward , to say the least. yeah , a little bit .
last night really changed things for me .
serena and i left things kind of uncertain , so i @-@ i think i wanna end it .
i know i do .
will you meet me ?
our spot in the park by the pond ?
see you there .
we &apos;re turning around .
one last battle , and the war is won .
humphrey , you are a born liar .
thanks , i think .
all that stuff about last night was genius .
anything you wanna tell me ?
uh , no. like you said , just born to lie .
honestly , dan , last night was fun ,
but i didn &apos;t really know what it would all mean to you .
well , i @-@ i normally don &apos;t jump into things like that , so when i do ,
it means a lot. me , too. that &apos;s why i think we should be together forever .
georgina , look , serena told me everything .
all right ? and i believe her .
no , you don &apos;t understand. she was upset and--and jealous .
i &apos;m sure she told you all kinds of things to
make you think the worst of me. no , just stop it .
i never meant for this to happen , but it did , and i know you feel it , too .
i mean , how else do you explain last night ?
i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t know , and i wish i could .
s @-@ so you &apos;re just gonna go back to serena
like nothing happened and just leave me all alone ?
oh , you &apos;re not alone , g .
i &apos;m here now , and i brought some people who really ,
really want to see you .
i think you remember your parents .
the only thing feared by the spawn of satan ?
mom and dad .
leave it to blair waldorf to know that bitches don &apos;t just happen .
they &apos;re made ...
by parents even more wicked than their offspring .
okay , i &apos;m ...
mom , dad , this is not what you think .
you have to believe me. there , there , georgie. it &apos;s gonna be okay .
no , this time , it won &apos;t. or it won &apos;t .
your parents were so worried , g .
they told me everything-- how you &apos;re supposed to be on
the equestrian circuit but sold your show pony for cocaine .
that was a difficult time , but i @-@ i &apos;ve put that behind me .
when ? when you were in rehab ?
it &apos;s hard to get clean when you hitchhike into town ,
steal a credit card and book a ticket to ibiza .
you didn &apos;t see where they sent me .
i mean , that place was awful. it was--it was in utah .
at least i lasted longer than lohan. we were trying to help .
i &apos;ve had enough . i have to go . georgina , stop .
yes , stay , georgina . i &apos;ll go .
oh , that reminds me .
i almost forgot to leave you the information
that i discussed with your parents. what &apos;s this ?
where you &apos;re going. a boot camp for troubled girls .
blair was kind enough to do some research. haven &apos;t you heard ?
i &apos;m the crazy bitch around here .
have fun at reform school .
so how long will you be on the road ?
well , i &apos;ll get the details. we &apos;ll figure it all out .
but it &apos;s kinda cool , right ? oh , it &apos;s very cool .
affirmation from my son. this is an historic moment .
well , last night must have been pretty historic as well ,
considering when i came home , you hadn &apos;t .
yeah , last night was pretty special .
i &apos;m sorry i skipped out early , by the way , dad .
i @-@ i &apos;d love to hear all about it , but i have a , uh , a wedding .
the wedding .
right. the wedding. of course .
so it &apos;s , uh , it &apos;s happening .
y @-@ yeah. yeah , dad , it is .
serena told me something about you and lily .
i @-@ i don &apos;t understand it fully ,
but the reason lily stayed away is &apos; cause serena asked her to .
thanks , dan .
well , just thanks .
check out my latest creation .
what do you think ?
you clean up nice , abrams .
thank you .
best man speech going that well ?
there won &apos;t be a dry eye in the house. trust me .
how did things go with whore @-@ gina ? not a dry eye there either .
good to know i wasn &apos;t missed . dan humphrey actually lent a hand .
it was nice to see him get his dirty for once .
not sure how much fun he had , though .
no one ever enjoys their first time. except you. save me a dance ?
now that georgina is done , so are you and i .
she was the last thing we had in common .
break a leg .
i think i just did .
there he is. best man ready to do his dad proud ?
captain , good to see you .
nate .
clearly , i missed something when i was away .
little advice , fellas ? you &apos;ve been friends a long time .
whoever she is , she &apos;s not worth it. couldn &apos;t agree more .
that &apos;s the problem .
how go the prenuptials ?
well , my mom &apos;s done this enough times .
you &apos;d think she &apos;d be a pro by now , but i don &apos;t know .
her heart doesn &apos;t really seem in it .
you think this will be us in 20 years , onto our fourth husbands ?
a girl can dream .
speaking of true love , dan isn &apos;t here .
he &apos;s coming .
so all is forgiven ?
i &apos;m working on it .
what do you have to work on ?
he &apos;s the one that has to forgive you .
yeah .
yeah , that &apos;s what i &apos;m working on .
you were supposed to get here during the
reception so no one would know i was gone .
you don &apos;t exactly blend in , you know ?
you gonna pay me or not ?
here .
good @-@ bye .
do me a favor and keep an eye on mr . archibald .
need a hand with that ?
rufus , what are you doing here ?
i thought we had security .
you want them to throw me out ?
well , i &apos;d like the option , considering how much i &apos;m paying them .
so you want me to leave ?
i didn &apos;t say that. do you want me to call off this wedding ?
and if you so much as nod yes , i will go out there ,
and i will tell your fianc ? and your guests they have to go home .
i didn &apos;t say that either .
we can figure this out .
oh , can we ?
it &apos;s been 20 years ,
and i don &apos;t think this is the moment to hash out the details .
look , we &apos;ve already had the &quot; morning after &quot; today .
what &apos;s gonna happen tomorrow morning ?
lil , i just got a divorce .
i don &apos;t wanna get married again , at least , not right away .
but i do .
i &apos;ve been alone for quite a while now , and you know what ?
it &apos;s hard. and i love bart , not just because he has money .
i have enough money. not that you can ever have enough money , but ...
i &apos;m rambling , and i &apos;m nervous , and you make me nervous .
that &apos;s a good thing , right ? there are just too many questions , too many .
what about dan and serena ?
whatever their feelings are for each other ,
if we &apos;re standing here 20 years in the making ...
yeah , those 20 years-- they have to count for something , don &apos;t they ?
i think they count for everything .
where &apos;s my mom ?
shouldn &apos;t we be saying vows around now ?
your mother is a wonderful woman , eric ,
but being on time-- not a strong suit .
let &apos;s pray lily is as slow getting dressed as you are .
you said you knew how to make a tie .
how would i know how to make a tie ? i hope serena doesn &apos;t kill me .
for being a few minutes late to her mom &apos;s wedding ?
well , that , amongst other things .
i @-@ i really have to talk to her. let me guess . georgina ?
i thought if i confronted her , it would make things better .
but it didn &apos;t and now ...
i have to tell her. well , no time like the present .
i @-@ i &apos;m gonna find my seat , okay ?
hey. hey . i have to talk to you .
i can &apos;t . i have to go. no , it--it can &apos;t wait. it &apos;s about georgina .
dan , it &apos;s okay . i don &apos;t wanna know .
no , you need to . i didn &apos;t sleep with her .
but ... i @-@ i may as well have .
serena , there you are .
come. yeah ? come , come , come .
i have to go .
and here we go. are you sure about this ?
ask me again , and i &apos;ll change my mind .
i love you , lily .
i love you , too , rufus .
then have a great wedding and try not to trip or anything .
oh ! i can &apos;t believe you put that in my mind .
well , luckily , i have done this before .
yeah .
oh ! how rude ! can you believe how late she is ?
dearly beloved ,
we are gathered here today in the face of this company to watch this man ..
and this woman ...
totally eff things up .
excuse me while i pull out a hankie and pass it to s. and d .
looks like i &apos;m not the only one who cries at weddings .
how &apos;s your food ?
good. thanks .
i was being sarcastic. you haven &apos;t eaten a bite .
let &apos;s go somewhere quiet. we can talk. excuse me . i need some air .
you sure ?
i &apos;ll be right back .
i need to talk to you .
your father &apos;s leaving .
he just stepped out to call my mom. everything okay ?
yes. no .
he just asked to have his car brought around .
he probably left his phone in it .
before the ceremony , i saw him with a guy doing a deal .
it looked like drugs .
my father is clean , chuck . i don &apos;t need you spying on him .
look , i know you hate me .
i was in love with blair , and i &apos;m sorry .
we do not have time to argue about this .
stop ! stop ! stop !
dad , what the hell are you doing ?
i left you a note at home .
yeah ? what &apos;s it say ? it says i &apos;m sorry .
for what ?
dad , if you &apos;ve relapsed , it &apos;s okay. we &apos;ll get you help .
chuck saw you earlier .
i wasn &apos;t buying drugs .
a passport ? you &apos;re skipping town ?
i &apos;m gonna be a much better father to
you from dominica than i will be from jail .
no , dad . i know you &apos;re scared , but we &apos;ll get through the trial .
no , we won &apos;t .
i &apos;m guilty , nate . i &apos;m facing 25 years .
so all this stuff about things looking good and working out , huh ? yeah .
what about mom ?
who do you think &apos;s paying for the private plane ?
why didn &apos;t you tell me any of this ?
cause i didn &apos;t want you to know anything , be an accessory .
this is the best thing for everyone .
i need you to step up right now .
be the man of the family for your mother .
it &apos;s been that for a while now .
nate .
that &apos;s for mom .
looks like nate isn &apos;t a fan of the fish ...
or his date .
blair , i &apos;m with nate , and you &apos;re at the singles table .
deal with it .
i just feel sorry for you is all .
dating an archibald is a tortured process-- the endless supply
of family drama , the fact that he never really got over serena .
though ,
falling for someone who &apos;s in love with
serena-- you already know how that feels , don &apos;t you ?
hey , have you guys seen chuck ? it &apos;s time fohis speech .
i &apos;ll look for him. maybe he &apos;s with my date .
excuse me .
so thank you .
it &apos;s your dad .
it &apos;s bigger than ... all the other stuff .
look , i &apos;m sorry ...
for all of it .
so am i .
so you said you loved her .
it &apos;s , uh ...
well , i never heard you say that before ...
about anyone .
ready to go back in ?
i don &apos;t think i &apos;m going back in .
just , um , tell vanessa i-- tell vanessa what ?
they &apos;re looking for you inside .
it &apos;s a long story .
i have time .
no. hey , hey. don &apos;t--don &apos;t run away from me .
dan , it &apos;s okay .
so you hooked up with georgina .
i kinda figured that when i saw her coming out of
your bedroom this morning , but i @-@ i &apos;m willing to let it go .
i don &apos;t wanna break up with you .
maybe ...
maybe i want to break up with you .
maybe i can &apos;t just &quot; let it go . &quot;
you lied to me over and over , and it was easy for you .
no , it wasn &apos;t easy .
i got seduced by a girl pretending to be someone else , and you knew .
but i couldn &apos;t say anything .
because you-- you were afraid i &apos;d find out you thought you killed someone .
i was hoping you &apos;d understand .
i am the most understanding person in the world .
but this ?
and--and--and this is not about who you used to be , your &quot; past ,
&quot; or who you were when we met .
i mean , the only reason i was with georgina was because yesterday morning ,
you slept with two random guys you met in a bar .
no , no , i @-@ i didn &apos;t . i just said that .
how is that less crazy ?
because i thought it would be easier to forgive than what i really did .
so what , dan ?
we &apos;re exactly where we were at the
bass &apos; brunch when we first started dating .
i &apos;m not who you thought i was , and you can &apos;t forgive that .
i @-@ i just think too much has happened .
i don &apos;t know how to make things go back to what they were .
so that &apos;s it then ?
it &apos;s just ...
&quot; have a good summer . i &apos;ll-- i &apos;ll see you back at school &quot; ?
i guess .
yeah .
i &apos;d like to propose a toast .
my father is someone who goes after what he wants ,
and lily van der woodsen was no exception .
in typical bass man fashion , his pursuit was direct , and at times ,
and at times , not exactly subtle .
one thing i learned from my father &apos;s courtship
of lily is the importance of perseverance-- that in
the face of true love , you don &apos;t just give up ,
even if the object of your affection is begging you to .
and one thing i learned from lily is the importance of forgiveness .
she gave my father the gift of a second chance , and in kind ,
i &apos;ve watched him become someone actually worthy of that gift .
and one day ,
i hope i &apos;ll be lucky enough to find someone who will do the same for me .
to the happy couple .
that was quite a speech .
all your hard work must have paid off .
that wasn &apos;t what i wrote .
i was inspired in the moment .
look , i know i said some horrible things , even for me .
you mean blogging to gossip girl about our sex
life and comparing me to your dad &apos;s sweaty old horse ?
what &apos;s your point ?
what &apos;s yours ?
you don &apos;t belong with nate .
never have , never will .
you don &apos;t belong with anyone .
oh , sorry. i , uh , i &apos;m looking for vanessa .
have you seen her ? i &apos;m trying to get out of here .
no , i haven &apos;t seen her .
okay .
serena , dan , out on the floor. oh , no , thank you .
oh , no. no , no. the bride and groom are asking for photos. here we go .
oh , that &apos;s not necessary. yes , it is .
you &apos;re gonna want to remember this night forever , yeah ?
i &apos;m sorry .
just smile .
let &apos;s take it slow this time .
do it right .
chuck bass is a romantic .
who knew ?
now you do .
that &apos;s all that matters .
he &apos;s gone. you can let go now .
i know .
i don &apos;t want to .
one week later
hey , jen. ooh ! oh , my god , dad .
well , hello to you , too .
mom &apos;s out getting bagels , dan &apos;s at the gallery , and the mail just came .
well , i appreciate the play @-@ by @-@ play .
it feel as if i &apos;m there .
yeah , well , uh , the letter came from parsons about my internship .
and what does it say ?
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;m too scared to open it .
what if i didn &apos;t get it ? what if you did ?
okay . i &apos;m opening it. hold my hand over the phone . i got ya .
and ...
aah ! i got it !
that &apos;s great , jen .
does it say who it &apos;s with ?
yeah. um , it &apos;s with ...
eleanor waldorf designs .
well , isn &apos;t that blair &apos;s mom ?
yeah .
yeah , it sure is .
so ... tuscany with chuck ?
sounds romantic ...
minus the chuck part .
he invited me-- in his father &apos;s private plane .
and i was headed to france , so ... hmm .
so it &apos;s worth a week with chuck to avoid airport security ?
oh , don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m gonna frisk him .
oh ! b . , gross !
what can i say ? he brings out the worst in me .
and weirdly , i think i bring out the best in him .
he &apos;s been a perfect gentleman this whole week .
is that why you &apos;re driving yourself to the airport ?
he wanted to see his dad before he left .
besides , we &apos;re taking the helicopter to teterboro .
i have to sit in the jump seat so that i can
tell the pilot if i have any thoughts on his flying .
oh , b . , what &apos;s it gonna take to get relax ? chuck .
oh ! god !
my ears are bleeding ! make it stop !
you gonna be okay ?
alone all summer without your best
friend who always gets you out of trouble ?
yeah . i &apos;m-- i &apos;m looking forward to staying out of trouble for a while .
have you talked to dan ?
no. not since the wedding .
it &apos;s for the best-- for him , for me .
i &apos;m fine .
yeah , i &apos;ll be taking off soon .
i wanted to catch my dad before i left , see how the honeymoon went ,
catch a glimpse of a man in love .
well , why don &apos;t you just take a look in the mirror , chuck ?
taking blair to europe , huh ?
things are getting pretty serious. it &apos;s no big deal .
my dad &apos;s jet was going to italy on business .
blair was going to france .
so are you planning to spend the summer sweating it out in brooklyn ?
uh , i think my time across the bridge is over .
nathaniel , what happened with you and punky brewster ?
so tell me. what--what exactly happened with you and man @-@ bangs ?
he is prettier than me , but that wasn &apos;t the problem .
and so what wait then ?
the , uh , the whole perpetually stoned , brooding guy thing ?
i actually enjoyed the quiet .
it was a nice change of pace from you. oh. was it his past with serena ?
no. that &apos;s just your issue .
it must &apos;ve been , uh , the--the different worlds thing , right ?
one of you always feeling like a fish out of water ?
i know exactly what you &apos;re doing .
ask me enough questions about nate , and i won &apos;t ask you about serena .
best offense is always a strong defense .
i , um ...
i &apos;m not ready to talk about it .
her .
good. then maybe it &apos;ll be quiet for 30 seconds .
no , no , no , no , no. you better get used to it , abrams .
welcome to the summer of dan humphrey , babblin &apos; at your ass 24 / 7,
from dusk till dawn .
come labor day , you &apos;re gonna be so sick of me .
it &apos;s been 13 years , and i &apos;m still not sick of you .
oh , not for lack of trying .
vanessa &apos;s a great girl , but i have too much going on right now. all right .
all right. bye. hey !
hey ! i was just seeing off blair .
i was just on the phone with chuck .
blair and chuck--now there &apos;s a couple you can root for .
yeah , well , if they &apos;re happy , i guess i &apos;m happy .
oh , come on , nate. when have you ever been happy ?
wow ! the gloves are off today , aren &apos;t they ?
i am feeling frisky .
you know how i get in the summer. yeah , i do .
well , you won &apos;t have to witness any of it .
i &apos;m locking myself away in the hamptons house .
well , it is a summer to reflect ... alone .
i could not agree more .
i just need to take a break away from everything and everyone .
yeah .
um , if you wanna reflect alone together , i &apos;ll be around .
what are you up to now ?
excuse me. is that the bass helicopter ? no , it &apos;s not here yet .
are you on the bass marketing team , too ? no , i &apos;m a guest of chuck bass .
if he &apos;s anything like his father , he must be ... terrifying .
he &apos;s not all bad. he is taking me to tuscany. that &apos;s romantic .
so where is he ? on his way .
i had to get here early . i like the jump seat. oh .
what ? nothing. it &apos;s just ... i like the jump seat .
i have this thing about flying , and it makes me feel more ... in control ?
yeah. yeah .
who &apos;s that ?
blair . i should get going .
i just wanted to see you before i disappeared for the summer .
i &apos;m glad you had a good trip .
i hope you have a good trip , too. you deserve it .
and , i must say , i &apos;m proud of you .
dad , my best man speech was a week ago , and it was nothing .
polite ? modest ? you really are growing up .
let &apos;s not get carried away .
i plan on holding on to my youth for as long as possible .
sometimes that choice isn &apos;t up to you .
that &apos;s the best thing about blair .
she knows me , knows i &apos;ll never change .
yeah ...
until you take her away to europe on a private jet .
that is gonna change everything .
but that &apos;s a good thing , son .
having a real girlfriend will force you to learn about responsibility ,
sacrifice , being faithful , taking into account somebody else &apos;s feelings ,
not just your own .
feelings ?
all the partying and the women ...
you will come back from this summer a new man .
take my word for it .
oh , i will .
can &apos;t wait to see you , b
oh ! there you are. this is amelia .
she &apos;s been helping me with the apartment renovations .
great. nice to meet you .
amelia .
a moment ?
what &apos;s this ?
i was hoping we could discuss what you have planned for my room .
and who are you ?
i &apos;m chuck bass .
everything all right ?
yeah. it--it &apos;s chuck .
i guess his dad is getting in late ,
and he won &apos;t be able to make the flight .
but he &apos;s booking something commercial .
well , i &apos;d be willing to flip you for the jump seat .
bart did just get the jet reupholstered ,
and i do like when the ladies make you those cookies .
what &apos;s ten hours ?
absence makes the heart grow fonder , right ?
they say a leopard can &apos;t change his spots ,
but some things do change-- the path not taken can become a road trip ...
being grounded can lead to something ground @-@ breaking ...
and whether they &apos;re sweating it out on the sultry streets or
cooling their heels in the hamptons , no one does summer like new yorkers .
grab your shades and your sunblock .
this one looks like a scorcher .
until then , you know you love me .
x.o.x.o. , gossip girl .
