hey . hey , pal .
what &apos;s going on ?
everything okay ?
you all right ?
you a little turned around ?
if you &apos;re headed to harrisburg , you &apos;re going the wrong way .
you hear me ?
what do you got there ?
assistant u.s. attorney ?
he hasn &apos;t spoken .
the doctor said he experienced severe trauma .
where did you find him ?
on a highway outside of harrisburg .
we &apos;re still piecing it together ,
but we think he may have been hitchhiking .
ma &apos;am ? are you okay ?
it &apos;s just ... it &apos;s been 12 years .
mark ? mark ?
it &apos;s me .
it &apos;s donna .
where have you been ?
it &apos;s been 12 years .
what is this ? a &apos; 78 ?
you got a picture ?
my father loved cadillacs .
and she &apos;s alive ?
she &apos;s calling herself jolene parker .
i &apos;ll notify you when i find her .
you don &apos;t have all the information .
i have all i need . - no . she &apos;s --
do i tell you how to do your job ?
no , i don &apos;t .
so don &apos;t tell me how to do mine .
if i was able to find you hiding on that sheep farm
outside of dingle , i can find this girl .
don &apos;t you worry how .
i love hats .
but that ...
honestly , that takes a certain kind of man .
what size are you ? 7.1 / 4 ?
i &apos;m a 7.1 / 2 .
i &apos;ll find the girl .
i don &apos;t want you to find her . i know where she is .
i want you to tell me where she &apos;s been .
cities , safe houses , aliases .
she &apos;s already faked her death to elude me . now she &apos;s back .
i want you to tell me everything you can
about where she &apos;s been , what she &apos;s been up to .
i mean , i thought this was a teacher conference ,
not a book burning .
there &apos;s nothing wrong with a little editing .
they &apos;re children .
kids shouldn &apos;t be reading &quot; lolita . &quot;
why not ? i mean , th @-@ the heart goes where it wants to go .
uh , mr. whitney &apos;s heart sent him
right into an affair with timmy logan &apos;s mom .
are you saying that &apos;s okay ?
no , i just-- i @-@ i @-@ i don &apos;t think
books are anything to be afraid of .
i mean , i think that people have affairs
because they &apos;re miserable in their marriages .
and i don &apos;t think you should judge them for it ,
and i certainly don &apos;t think you can blame a book .
来电
what do you think , tom ?
i think mr. whitney should thank his lucky stars
because timmy logan &apos;s mom is way out of his league .
call me provincial , but i for one think it &apos;s inappropriate .
i mean , how old is he , anyway ?
lizzy .
have you seen the paper ?
what about it ?
mark hastings , u.s. attorney from maryland--
12 years ago , he indicted the head of the reynoso cartel .
a week later , he went missing .
i remember . the bureau assumed it was a retribution killing .
yeah , well , two days ago , he was found
wandering on a road in pennsylvania .
nobody knows where he &apos;s been .
was he in hiding ?
i believe he was held captive , but not by the reynoso cartel .
it &apos;s all quite a mystery .
they say he &apos;s too traumatized to speak .
but if what i believe about hastings is true ,
if he has been held captive all these years ,
then it would confirm that the myth is true--
the judge is real .
the judge ?
every culture has a justice myth ,
an avenging angel who exacts retribution
for the weak and innocent .
golem for the jews , tu po for the chinese .
the ancient greeks had adrestia , the goddess of revenge .
and we have the judge .
think of him as a prisoner &apos;s court of last resort .
when your legal appeals have all been exhausted
and there is no hope left ,
you can make one last plea to the judge .
what kind of plea ?
prisoners can state their case ,
argue their innocence , explain why
they were convicted unfairly and who is responsible--
a prosecutor , a corrupt detective ,
maybe an incompetent public defender .
this demand for justice-- where does it go ?
supposedly , it &apos;s passed among inmates
until it finally reaches some book depository
at the federal penitentiary in monroe , virginia .
and then ?
nobody knows for sure .
nobody &apos;s ever met him .
somehow , the appeals make their way to the judge .
he reviews the case ,
and if he thinks you &apos;re innocent ,
he evens the score .
if freedom or life were taken unfairly ,
he demands the same in return-- an eye for an eye .
第一季第十五集
reddington says mark hastings was held captive ?
yes , but not by reynoso .
he thinks it might &apos;ve been payback for a different case
hastings prosecuted 12 years ago .
aram ?
leonard debs-- sentenced to 14 years
for armed robbery when he was 28 .
according to this so @-@ called judge , this guy is innocent ?
a witness allegedly came forward at the time
saying debs wasn &apos;t at the scene .
hastings never told the defense .
debs got out two months ago .
he served 12 years of his 14 @-@ year sentence .
hastings went missing 12 years ago .
hastings took 12 years away from leonard debs ,
so the judge evened the score .
and reddington says there have been others .
a new york homicide detective , an appellate court judge ,
two prosecutors all missing and presumed dead ,
all involved in cases in which some impropriety was alleged ,
which made them targets for the judge .
an underground criminal court of appeals .
we believe that the appeals are being processed
through a book depository run by a prison @-@ literacy project .
we pulled the files of everyone who worked at the depository ,
and i think we found something .
frank gordon-- a civilian now , but he &apos;s a convicted killer .
弗兰克 · 戈登
he now works for a prison @-@ literacy project
at their book depository in monroe , virginia .
he takes the letters from the returned books ,
screens them for the judge .
find him .
and see if you can get anything out of him .
frank &apos;s been with us for almost six years now ,
ever since the court reversed his conviction .
does his job require he interact with prisoners ?
well , n @-@ not directly , but he does respond to their requests .
our program is one of the many
that provides inmates with reading materials .
frank ?
who else knows frank stays here ?
i @-@ is he in some kind of trouble ?
what &apos;s back there ?
oh , i @-@ i really feel we should wait for frank to come back .
it &apos;s his space . it &apos;s ...
stay here .
hello ?
mr. gordon ? fbi . we &apos;d like to talk to you .
what is it ?
stay where you are .
ressler ?
you okay ?
ressler !
he was just there .
agent keen-- she fired , tried to stop him ,
but it happened too fast .
he got away .
i set up checkpoints at all major roads and highways ,
sent frank gordon &apos;s photo to state , federal .
you &apos;re not gonna believe this .
pleas from inmates ,
all handwritten from prisons all over the country--
adx , marion , pelican bay .
and look at this .
alan ray rifkin .
it &apos;s a case folder-- research , evidence .
frank was reviewing trial transcripts for the judge .
alan ray rifkin-- american college student ,
dropped out , joined the army , deployed to afghanistan .
in 2003 , he was tried and convicted
as an enemy combatant-- fought alongside the taliban .
he &apos;s scheduled for execution tomorrow .
according to the charges ,
rifkin and a few dozen taliban fighters
raided an afghan village , killing dozens of civilians .
at trial , rifkin &apos;s lawyers claimed it was friendly fire ,
that the american military destroyed the village ,
from the air , mistaking it for a taliban outpost .
the military denied it .
so the judge thinks rifkin is innocent .
guys , that rifkin case you were asking about--
the investigating officer was the senior fbi agent
in afghanistan at the time--
harold cooper .
you think this is a coincidence ?
reddington feeds you the judge ,
and i &apos;m next on that lunatic &apos;s hit list ?
we need to take it seriously .
no , we don &apos;t .
the federal prosecutor on the case is tom connolly .
his reputation speaks for itself . so should mine .
rifkin admitted to treason .
we &apos;re not saying he &apos;s innocent .
but if you or connolly are in danger--
what exactly does this so @-@ called judge think that we missed ?
we don &apos;t know yet . we &apos;re reviewing the file now .
fine .
you do what you need to do .
but i &apos;m telling you , alan ray rifkin is guilty .
and i for one will lose no sleep
watching him pay the ultimate price for his crimes .
mr. rifkin , my name is agent keen .
i &apos;m with the fbi .
oh , i &apos;d stand and applaud , but --
alan , be nice .
i &apos;m sorry , but i was told
mr. rifkin had waived all representation .
he has . all of his legal claims have been exhausted .
then you are ... ?
oh , ruth kipling , the amnesty collective .
the capital guidelines state that death @-@ row inmates
are allowed a designated spiritual adviser .
okay .
first , let me tell you
that i &apos;m not here to reconsider your case .
the court rulings are final .
uh , how &apos;s this work , agent keen ?
you just assume that i &apos;m stupid ?
i &apos;m not here to see if you &apos;re stupid , mr. rifkin .
i &apos;m here to see if you &apos;re angry--
angry enough to want revenge .
it &apos;s my understanding
you filed for a demand of justice with the judge .
no , as i said ,
all of his legal appeals have been exhausted .
he knows what i mean .
since when does the fbi believe in prison @-@ yard myths ?
it &apos;s a story .
he doesn &apos;t exist .
here &apos;s what i will say--
i have a sacred duty to battle the evil that put me here .
and who put you here ?
you read his file . you know he confessed .
i assure you , not of my own freewill .
you &apos;re saying you were coerced ?
i &apos;m saying that i was beaten .
i &apos;m saying that fbi agent harold cooper--
he beat me under the orders
of assistant u.s. attorney thomas connolly .
what &apos;s the story with guys and basketball , anyway ?
honestly , if the wizards were playing ,
i could stand in front of my tv naked ,
and you know what my fiance would say ?
&quot; move . &quot;
really ?
ma &apos;am ?
uh , maker &apos;s . double .
she &apos;s having an affair with mr. whitney .
have you talked to him about it ?
yeah , i have .
believe me , it &apos;s not good ,
especially during parent @-@ teacher conferences ...
because her husband has no clue .
but , you know , that &apos;s the job .
i mean , teachers get to know every part
of their students &apos; lives , their families .
some of it you just have to keep secret .
are you good at that ?
at what ?
keeping secrets .
where &apos;s your wife ?
sh @-@ she couldn &apos;t come .
did you invite her ?
i thought-- i thought you had a fiance ?
oh , i do . we haven &apos;t picked a date yet .
i &apos;d invite you to the wedding ,
but i don &apos;t think he &apos;d like you .
why is that ?
isn &apos;t it obvious ?
you here buying me drinks while your wife &apos;s back home ?
i haven &apos;t done anything wrong .
oh , my god .
hi .
oh , my god .
oh , god .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry .
yeah , me too .
you know , actually , i &apos;m not that sorry .
i &apos;m in room 618 .
yeah , i &apos;m there now .
where are we on the rifkin case ?
understood , but i need to know that you and your men
will be ready to grab connolly and cooper
if the execution goes down as scheduled .
okay , bye .
damn fbi .
couldn &apos;t find their own asses with a mirror and a gps .
how the hell did they find you ?
i don &apos;t know .
somebody must be talking , and it &apos;s certainly not me .
oh , frank , i believe you .
约翰是耶稣的爱徒 犹大则是叛徒
you &apos;re a john , not a judas .
walk with me . it &apos;s feeding time .
hastings , the one we released--
do we know if he &apos;s talking to the authorities ?
he &apos;s not . his mind &apos;s too far gone .
my sources say he &apos;s with his family--
still hasn &apos;t spoken a word .
ah , it &apos;s just a matter of time .
about the rifkin execution-- we &apos;re ready to respond ,
but ...
yeah , but what ?
frank , frank , look at me .
you were innocent .
people like this put you in jail .
they took 20 years of your life ,
30 from my father .
but if they &apos;re on to us ?
if they find us , so be it .
until then , i &apos;m not gonna stop the work we &apos;re doing .
if rifkin dies , tell the others to carry out the sentence .
just because you &apos;re on the outside now
doesn &apos;t mean you can forget .
good night , mother .
okay , so , the question is ,
why does the judge think rifkin is innocent ?
we &apos;ve been together a timeline of events
using the file you found in frank gordon &apos;s room ,
and we found a problem .
after rifkin was caught , cooper had him flown from bagram
to andrews air force base in virginia .
from there , prison transport took them
to a federal holding facility in alexandria .
that trip should &apos;ve taken 30 minutes .
at trial , the u.s. marshal supervising the transport
said it arrived on schedule .
but look at this-- the event log .
it recorded the actual time
that the marshal swiped in to alexandria .
that trip didn &apos;t take half an hour .
it took 2.1 / 2 hours .
why wasn &apos;t this presented at trial ?
another event log was--
one that matched the 30 @-@ minute timeline .
one of the event logs is fake .
we should find the marshal , ask him directly .
william munson ?
agent keen . fbi .
i &apos;m investigating a case you &apos;re connected to .
the defendant is alan ray rifkin .
not here .
i don &apos;t want the people i work with
knowing i &apos;m involved in this .
i &apos;m running out of time , mr. munson .
alan ray rifkin is running out of time .
i know that . why the hell do you think i came forward ?
came forward ? to whom ?
that group ,
the one that fights against the death penalty--
the amnesty collective .
you and cooper ,
you were at andrews when rifkin landed .
you drove him ?
yeah , i was there .
but cooper and me , we weren &apos;t the only ones .
that prosecutor , tom connolly ,
he was waiting on the tarmac .
connolly was there ?
yeah . he was angry .
said the rifkin case was assigned to him .
kept saying they didn &apos;t have enough to convict .
he was going places , you know ,
and he wasn &apos;t gonna wreck his career
by losing a high @-@ profile case .
you heard this ?
he said they needed a confession .
he told cooper to pick him up ,
take him over to one of the hangars ,
and not let him out until he admitted it .
mr. munson , did agent cooper
physically coerce rifkin ?
&quot; physically coerce &quot; ?
man , you feds are too much .
he beat him , yeah .
i swept out the entry log , made the timeline make sense ,
and i had rifkin treated in his cell
instead of the infirmary to avoid any record .
everyone said he was betraying our country .
but now , if he &apos;s really gonna die ...
tom .
harold . what are you doing out this way ?
looking for you , tom .
we have a problem with rifkin .
we need to contain this .
i found a flash drive , and your girl got some stuff .
the last six months , she &apos;s been in havana ,
port @-@ au @-@ prince , miami , various aliases .
last september , she was in prague .
this jolene is definitely moving towards something .
red ...
best i can tell , the girl &apos;s tracking someone ,
causing trouble .
she &apos;s either got lots of little targets
or one real big one .
we need to talk about rifkin .
i &apos;ve already said everything i have to say on the subject .
sir , i need to know whether you--
what &apos;s going on ?
agent keen , this is u.s. attorney tom connolly .
harold &apos;s been telling me what a great agent you are .
dog with a bone .
sir , may we speak privately ?
the thing is , this rifkin case--
the court has made its decision .
agent keen , whatever you have to say to me ,
you can say to both of us .
i need to know what happened at the airport
after you landed with rifkin .
rifkin was transferred to a holding facility , as documented .
you beat a confession out of him .
who told you that ?
your transport log was doctored .
this is the real log , which shows
how long rifkin was actually at the airport .
there &apos;s a two @-@ hour gap .
where &apos;d you get that ?
does it matter ?
let &apos;s not play games .
you clearly have a theory . let &apos;s hear it .
no , i don &apos;t have a theory .
i have a witness who says he heard you
order you to beat a confession out of rifkin .
he saw it happen .
i did not railroad an innocent man .
there were witnesses , firsthand accounts .
did you beat him ?
yes .
agent keen , alan ray rifkin deserves
the sentence he received for his crimes .
he &apos;s being transferred for execution .
we have to stop it until the court looks at his confession .
his day in court is over .
he &apos;s exhausted his appeals .
once that happens , the supreme court is clear .
why he confessed or whether he &apos;s even guilty
becomes legally irrelevant .
we &apos;ll see if the federal clemency officer agrees with you .
he won &apos;t even agree to a meeting .
be careful who you go around talking to , agent keen .
are you telling me this , or is he ?
the only career you should worry about is your own .
upon arrival at the execution facility ,
the condemned shall be provided a form bp 199,
in which he will be asked where his body is to be sent .
i understand . no .
he &apos;s the federal clemency officer .
i need to talk to him .
yes , please have him call me .
he may have not more than one spiritual adviser ,
two defense attorneys ,
and up to five adult friends or relatives .
connolly was right .
they don &apos;t consider the event log new evidence ,
and even if they did , the deadline to consider
rifkin &apos;s factual innocence has passed .
do they realize how insane that is ?
his innocence can &apos;t be considered ?
i just want to say ... i didn &apos;t do it .
you &apos;re killing an innocent man here tonight .
even god won &apos;t forgive you for this .
we &apos;re ready .
good night , mother .
good night . good night .
we did the right thing .
yes . just not the right way .
let me ask you something .
that agent , keen , the task force .
i mean , i &apos;ve asked around on the hill , main justice .
nobody knows what the hell it is you do .
i &apos;ve heard the stories .
they say you guys are taking down everybody --
people who aren &apos;t even on our radar .
how ?
nothing ? really ?
well , i can tell you this .
when i &apos;m attorney general and i get the president
to appoint you director of the fbi ,
you &apos;re gonna tell me all about it ,
the truth about your secret weapon ...
... because we both know you have one .
the judge would like to see you .
an innocent man is dead
because of you , because you lied .
alan ray rifkin was a terrorist .
you beat him to force a confession .
to a crime he committed .
cooper &apos;s been taken .
by whom ?
the judge , we think ,
as retribution for rifkin &apos;s execution .
anything ?
not yet .
alan ray rifkin ?
we &apos;ve got nothing !
no license plate , no surveillance footage .
they could be anywhere by now .
back up , lizzy . rifkin . go back to rifkin .
why would the judge hold cooper responsible for his execution ?
because he coerced rifkin &apos;s confession .
you &apos;re certain of that ?
cooper admitted it to me .
how about the guy the judge released ?
hastings ?
we &apos;re getting a court order
to talk to him over his doctor &apos;s objections .
he &apos;s worried about further trauma .
if you ever want to see cooper again ,
you need to get hastings to talk .
lizzy , i must be going .
wait . did you hear me ?
rifkin was executed-- an eye for an eye .
cooper is going to die .
dembe , you better tell edward
there &apos;s gonna be a change in flight plan .
a woman &apos;s son is dead because of you--
a husband , father , brother ,
a good man .
rifkin was given every opportunity
to prove his innocence .
prove to who ?
to you ?
to the very people who framed him in the first place ?
you know , if you did your job right ,
i wouldn &apos;t have to do mine !
how do you plead ?
lady , listen , this thing you &apos;re doing ,
th @-@ this-- this is a horrible mistake .
i said , how do you plead ?
i guess i plead ... not guilty .
madame .
i find you guilty .
richard .
say something , richard .
i keep meaning to attend our academy class reunions ,
and i remember how pinched i look in dinner dress blues .
what the hell do you want ?
how &apos;s your family ?
my wife left me , thanks .
after i was sidelined .
you made a hell of a mess when you left .
nobody believed we couldn &apos;t see it coming .
maybe we helped you .
maybe we facilitated your treason .
even without any evidence ,
it was enough to destroy some careers .
yes .
richard , i need to know about the rifkin case .
he claims civilians were fired on
by soldiers from a black hawk
that centcom says it never deployed .
i can &apos;t help you .
you were operational in the guldara district .
if there were choppers in the air , you knew about it .
rooming with you was the worst thing
that ever happened to me .
i &apos;m offering you an opportunity , richard .
the men who want this information can be ...
very helpful .
if you help them ,
it could put you back on track .
i &apos;m so sorry , mr. hastings .
i can &apos;t imagine how difficult this must be for you .
but there are others still there , being held .
i need to know where you were held .
enough .
please .
just go .
good night , mother .
no , mark , it &apos;s me .
it &apos;s donna .
aram , the paper said rifkin &apos;s last words
at his execution were &quot; good night , mother . &quot;
he said it to his spiritual adviser , ruth kipling .
i just heard hastings say it .
okay , ruth suzanne kipling-- single , 62,
attended vassar college , and co @-@ founded
the prison rights organization the amnesty collective .
the marshal that covered up for cooper and connolly--
that &apos;s the organization he reached out to .
which is how kipling found out about the entry @-@ log evidence .
okay , i &apos;ve got an address in mercer county , pennsylvania .
i bet that &apos;s where she &apos;s holding them .
we ready , frank ?
red .
lizzy , have you located harold ?
yes . we &apos;re almost there .
there &apos;s been a development .
thus do i commend thee
into the arms of our lord jesus christ ,
the preserver of all mercy and reality ,
and the father--
we got a problem .
get your men out of here .
fall back now .
move ! move ! let &apos;s go .
what are they doing ? why are they moving back ?
they want to talk .
ruth , this is not a tactic .
i &apos;m not trying to negotiate .
yes , new information on the rifkin case .
someone with high @-@ level access is en route .
of course .
a woman .
if you came to advocate on behalf of agent cooper--
i didn &apos;t .
i came to advocate on behalf of you .
after devoting your life to a pursuit of the truth ,
to making things right , it would be such a shame
in your last act to get it so wrong .
this is a classified pentagon file
on the rifkin case .
in the spirit of full disclosure ,
it &apos;s a felony for me to have it or for you to see it .
but under the circumstances , who are we to quibble ?
it states that on october 3 , 2002,
u.s. military intelligence officers deployed a unit
by helicopter to the village of guldara
in the kabul province of afghanistan
to extract an asset whose identity had been compromised .
the taliban in the area with whom alan ray rifkin
had aligned himself got word of the informant
and advanced on the village .
but they were too late .
the boys had extracted their asset and left .
angry and suspicious of others , the taliban and rifkin
set fire to the village and executed inhabitants .
dozens of women and children
were killed at the hands of the taliban in response
to u.s. military intelligence in the area .
i guess , fearing more headlines ,
the pentagon wanted no association with the incident ,
so they covered it up .
that is what happened .
that is the truth .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re not gonna light up agent cooper today .
alan ray rifkin wasn &apos;t executed
because of a beating or because of a cover @-@ up .
he was executed because of the truth .
now , you and i could talk for days
about the whys and why @-@ nots of an execution ,
but at the end of it all , in the final moment ,
the only irrefutable fact is you better be right .
and i &apos;m betting you &apos;re not so sure .
how could you possibly know what i &apos;m thinking ?
mark hastings .
you let him go
because he had served his time ,
because this has always been about justice in your eyes ,
not blind revenge .
the day you started this ,
you knew it would inevitably end ,
that when you released your first prisoner ,
you would get caught .
you don &apos;t want to diminish your legacy of righteousness
because of him ...
which is why you &apos;re going to surrender .
harold , don &apos;t look so glum .
i thought you were gone .
what happened ?
my secret weapon .
five prosecutors , a federal judge , two cops--
there were 10 people in that bunker .
what &apos;s this ?
pleas we found in frank gordon &apos;s room
from prisoners all over the country .
send it to the justice department for review .
walk with me ?
agent keen , i regret the methods
that we employed to obtain rifkin &apos;s confession .
if you feel obligated to report it , i understand .
i think we &apos;ve had enough judgment for today .
you knew this was gonna happen with me , the judge .
if you thought that by saving me
you &apos;d get some kind of leverage--
harold , a war is coming .
i believe the incursion of this facility
and the rather sudden disappearance of diane fowler
were just the beginning ,
and i &apos;m certain that things will get considerably worse
before they get better .
you want my help .
not now .
later .
but when i do ,
i hope you &apos;ll remember what happened today .
is that it ?
no .
i &apos;d like you to reach out to admiral richard abraham .
he was very helpful in resolving the matters of the day .
he &apos;s had a rough go of it for quite some time .
abraham .
yes .
admiral richard .
he &apos;s a good man .
i wonder if you could ... pull a few strings .
i &apos;ll see what i can do .
what have you found ?
looks like your girl has been following your every move .
you want me to bring her in ?
no .
i believe she &apos;s finishing an operation .
i &apos;d like to see how it plays out .
