kyle .
where &apos;s paige ?
everybody inside !
hands up .
get down on the ground ! get down on the ground !
you wanted to see me ?
yeah . have a seat .
so the attorney general has announced
a first of its kind comprehensive review
of every serial criminal in federal prison .
ok .
and he wants you to supervise and coordinate the team .
congratulations .
uh ... um , i &apos;ve--eh--
i &apos;m just gonna hyperventilate for a moment ,
so if i could just have--
ok , well--well , when ?
when--when does he need it ?
it &apos;s ambitious . he says it &apos;s all gonna happen in a year
and you &apos;d need to start immediately .
you &apos;d have to leave the bau .
no . oh . i--
no , i came here for a reason .
i love what we do .
i don &apos;t want to leave .
but it &apos;s a great opportunity .
why don &apos;t you take some time to think about it ?
don &apos;t go .
garcia ?
i &apos;m sorry , sir . i wasn &apos;t--
i wasn &apos;t eavesdropping . official business .
what is that ?
uh--oh , it &apos;s-- it &apos;s fresh off the wire .
there &apos;s a single murder , but they think that single murder
is super significant because the field office email
said &quot; urgent &quot; like 3 times .
this is in glenport village .
what &apos;s in glenport village .
uh , glenport village is a planned community of sex offenders .
i wrote the psychological questionnaire that reverend santos uses
to choose the residents .
planned community of sex offenders ? you &apos;re serious ?
glenport village , florida , houses a wide spectrum
of non @-@ violent offenders ,
crimes ranging from statutory rape
to public urination in front of children .
no rapists or murderers until now .
well , i can tell you one thing .
reverend santos and his community are dedicated to reform .
it says here he went to jail at 18 for impregnating
his 15 @-@ year @-@ old girlfriend .
yes , but no offenses since and 40 years and two children later ,
they &apos;re still happily married .
am i reading this right ? families with kids live there ?
the law requires sexual offenders to live certain distances
from bus stops , playgrounds , and schools ,
but it says nothing about being their neighbors .
in most cities that &apos;s a legal oversight , but in this one ,
it was part of the design plan
look , here &apos;s some context . in 2009 , reverend santos
was able to buy up a few homes in barclay bay using church funds .
now , the real estate was already inexpensive in this area ,
but when surrounding residents found out
that he planned to house sex offenders ,
there was a mass exodus ,
so eventually he was able to buy up the rest of the homes
and then rename the town .
will he cooperate with us ?
he &apos;s already sending us files on all the residents ,
past and present .
this community is a fascinating experiment .
typically when sex offenders
try to reintegrate into society ,
they &apos;re rejected , they &apos;re isolated .
but this community , sick of the harassment ,
decided to self @-@ isolate .
well , that experiment just backfired .
yeah , in a massive way .
two nights ago authorities found
the body of paige lincoln in her bathroom .
she was stabbed in the chest and the stomach .
yeah , i &apos;m just shocked
that the reverend didn &apos;t call me immediately .
well , they had a suspect right away--
her husband , kyle lincoln .
he was covered in her blood ,
but his alibi checked out this morning ,
and the blood was because he was trying to resuscitate her .
and now we have a two @-@ day @-@ old crime scene
and a town full of suspects .
wheels up in 30 .

it &apos;s all the way down the block .
what are you , scared ?
no .
yes , you are .
maggie , wait !
&quot; i swear , from the bottom of my heart ,
i want to be healed , i want to be like other men ,
not this outcast who nobody wants . &quot;
e.m. forster .
the victim , paige lincoln , was a high school teacher
caught making out with a student .
she moved to glenport village shortly thereafter ,
met her husband kyle , who &apos;s an offender there ,
and by all accounts , their marriage was stable .
she was found in a cheerleader outfit
that according to her amazon purchases , she bought .
must have been her husband &apos;s fantasy .
well , according to her history , it could be hers .
i mean , is that why she was killed ?
maybe she was having an affair .
well , if paige was looking for guys who were into cheerleaders ,
this town was a good place to start .
i know this preacher , ok ? these aren &apos;t bad people .
just because this happened here doesn &apos;t mean a resident did it .
we just need to keep all of our options open .
she &apos;s right . this isn &apos;t a prison or military base .
people move in and out freely .
what if this was a vendetta kill
committed by a victim of a glenport village resident ?
revenge is a good motivator .
garcia &apos;s tracking outside threats .
when we land , lewis and i will go talk to the reverend .
dave , you go to the m.e.
morgan , you and reid go talk to paige &apos;s husband .
mr. lincoln , we need to ask you some personal questions .
are you sure that you &apos;re up to this ?
yeah , it &apos;s fine .
just ... just get it over with .
the cheerleader costume .
we know paige bought it .
was that role play something that she was into , or ...
no , i ...
it was my thing .
who else would have known that ?
nobody .
look , why is this so important ?
the man who killed paige dressed her up before he took her life .
so either he has the same role playing preference you do ...
or he &apos;s trying to frame you with it .
do you see where we &apos;re going with this ?
sometimes i &apos;d ...
i &apos;d want her to have it on when i got home .
i &apos;d text her . only it wasn &apos;t a text ,
it was a ...
internet relay chat .
it &apos;s like a text , only--
irc self @-@ deletes when you close the window .
exactly .
why would you need so much privacy ?
you haven &apos;t met the reverend , have you ?
that &apos;s everyone , tara .
all 1,922 citizens .
you &apos;ll find case histories , probationary reports ,
hopefully everything you need .
great . thanks , reverend .
i just wish we were meeting again under better circumstances .
did anyone have any issues with the lincoln family , reverend ?
no one has much trouble with anyone here .
ever ?
i took your ideas
and i instituted a couple of my own .
ask the sheriff about how successful we &apos;ve been .
well , i &apos;m surprised , but he &apos;s right .
20 years of police work ,
this is the quietest beat i &apos;ve ever had .
how have you accomplished that ?
there &apos;s an application process ?
it &apos;s intense .
and what happens once you get in ?
the residents all sign contracts .
we &apos;re about transparency .
reverend , we worked together for 6 years with no issues .
why hide this ?
paul , it &apos;s not personal ,
but we can self @-@ police better than you .
what happened two nights ago was a tragedy ,
but it &apos;s also the first violent crime in 6 years .
that &apos;s well below the national average , i believe .
exactly what do residents agree to in these contracts ?
it &apos;s a tracking chip .
it &apos;s surgically implanted .
and the reverend makes you wear it ?
hiding a contract from me is one thing , but a tracker ?
that does seem extreme , reverend .
nobody &apos;s coerced .
if they don &apos;t like it , they can leave .
can the chip be removed ?
yes , and if they try without my approval ,
i &apos;m notified .
but that &apos;s never happened .
do you have one ?
don &apos;t need it .
my incident was decades ago .
look , if a resident lives here without trouble for 5 years ,
i take theirs out as well .
a contract . a tracker .
that &apos;s quite the secret playbook , reverend .
everything is done in the name our our protection .
how accurate is the gps on those trackers ?
it &apos;s down to 3 feet .
that data &apos;s a good starting point .
we could begin with the whereabouts of every resident
in the community with a tracker .
who was in the lincoln house the night of the murder , reverend ?
i &apos;ve been working on that since you landed .
c.o.d was exsanguination caused by
stab wounds to the abdomen and chest .
hell of a lot of overkill .
this looks personal . defensive wounds ?
across her palms and forearms .
any hesitation marks ?
none .
it &apos;s probably not his first time .
what about sexual assault ?
no obvious signs .
if he &apos;s in codis ,
he might not risk it .
the costume is covered in the victim &apos;s blood ,
but there aren &apos;t any knife perforations in the fabric .
so he dressed her postmortem .
yes .
this unsub needs a compliant victim
to proceed with his fantasy .
the problem is , a live one isn &apos;t .
all right , thanks , lewis .
randy nelson , the lincolns &apos; neighbor .
he seems to be the only one in the house that day
with a tracker .
according to the reverend , he &apos;s here for flashing married women .
paige fits that victimology .
the question is , would randy dress her as a cheerleader ?
let &apos;s take him in and find out .
here &apos;s some money . bring back the change , all right ?
oh , agent hotchner . danny , come here .
these are my kids . this is riley .
hi , riley .
hi .
and this is danny .
danny . how do you do ?
can we go now ?
yeah , sure .
riley , straight home after you finish shopping ,
all right , riley ?
i know .
sorry about that .
it hasn &apos;t been easy .
they , uh , they came here after my ex @-@ wife passed
6 months ago .
you got kids ?
one . a 10 @-@ year @-@ old boy .
oh , i &apos;m in over my head .
we live 5 miles outside of glenport village ,
but the place still informs every parental decision i make .
sure .
especially on a day like this .
this place sucks .
first we move into my dad &apos;s so late in the year
that i miss cheer tryouts ,
then the ap chem is boring .
southville is the worst .
i like it . i mean , i get to play soccer .
and dad &apos;s here .
god , you &apos;re so simple .
no , i get it . i mean , you miss your old neighborhood .
you have no idea .
no offense .
no , no , none taken .
so , i , um , i heard about this party tonight at greg &apos;s .
i @-@ i can get us in .
you can get us in ?
probably . i mean , i &apos;ll try .
oh , it &apos;s not gonna matter &apos; cause my dad won &apos;t let me go .
well , why not ?
look who the neighbors are .
you were friends with paige ?
i was , yes .
for how long ?
years . 3 , maybe , yeah .
she was the only one in glenport village who was nice to me .
how come ?
that &apos;s just how it is , even in a town like this .
randy , come have a seat .
make yourself comfortable .
you &apos;re not under arrest .
here &apos;s the thing , randy .
the guy who did this ,
he was into cheerleaders .
well , i &apos;m not .
maybe the killer just wants us to believe that he is .
i don &apos;t know about any of this .
you were in paige &apos;s house at 3 p.m. that afternoon .
you have a history with housewives .
but here &apos;s the strange thing .
our analyst went through your internet history .
not a single trace of porn ,
of any kind .
the others use it as a safety valve ,
a way to release pressure .
i manage fine without that .
well , it &apos;s possible . or maybe you &apos;re just better at hiding it .
no , you &apos;re wrong .
my life &apos;s an open book .
you &apos;re looking at it .
randy , what i &apos;m looking at is each of the women you flashed ...
were mothers .
and each of them was in the company
of their grade @-@ school @-@ age son when you did it .
now , that school bus drops off tommy gannon every afternoon .
he lives right next door to paige ,
and he &apos;s 8 years old .
that &apos;s why you go over for coffee , isn &apos;t it ,
to watch him .
no . absolutely not .
randy , those women were never your targets .
their children were .
and if the reverend finds out that you &apos;re a pedophile ,
you can &apos;t live here anymore .
and that is why paige was your only friend ,
because you couldn &apos;t afford
to let anybody else know what you were into .
i tried to stop .
please , i &apos;m sorry .
randy ,
we have to tell the reverend and the sheriff about this .
no . no , please .
what do you two want for dinner tonight ?
i don &apos;t know .
danny ?
burgers !
no , gross , we had burgers twice this week .
ah , well , maybe i &apos;ll do up them potatoes y &apos;all like ?
dad .
what ? last summer you loved them .
no , it &apos;s fine .
i still like them .
here you go .
why don &apos;t we just order a pizza or something ?
danny , is that ok with you ?
yeah , fine .
you have homework tonight ?
ap chem .
book report .
hey , matt !
sheriff .
hey , riley , will you , uh ,
will you look over danny &apos;s work tonight ?
sure .
so , dad ...
um , there &apos;s this party tonight .
everybody will be there . can i go ?
where is it ?
not far .
but like in the total opposite direction
from glenport village .
ok .
what ? !
what ? !
but you can &apos;t leave until i &apos;m back from my rounds .
someone needs to be here with danny .
yeah , ok .
and home by 10 : 30 .
thank you , thank you , thank you , thank you !
yeah . you &apos;re the best dad ever .
you let her do anything she wants .
hey , didn &apos;t i let you play video games
this morning before school ?
yeah .
so finish your homework . you can play more tonight , ok ?
ok .
see you later .
bye , victoria .
bye , vickie .
here name &apos;s victoria taylor .
she was a senior at cove high .
an honor student and cheerleader .
sorry , my , uh , daughter went to a football game
at their school last week .
she was killed in uniform . no postmortem dressing .
different victimology . different m.o.
we got two killers here ?
what if the unsub &apos;s showing his true colors ?
paige was the surrogate , victoria his ideal .
one he probably spent weeks trying to find .
location also narrows down our suspect pool .
how do you figure ?
we &apos;re 10 miles from glenport village .
that eliminates anyone with a tracking device .
sheriff , round up your men .
we &apos;re ready to deliver the profile .
based on the age of everyone without a chip ,
we are searching for a man in his late 30s to early 40s .
in addition to them , we &apos;re also looking at residents
from nearby communities .
regardless of location , this unsub is experienced ,
organized , and worst of all , he is patient .
he has practiced extreme self @-@ control to sublimate his desires .
frequent precursor crimes to this kind of fetishized murder
include peeping and petty larceny
of object like undergarments .
now , this guy &apos;s probably fantasized and obsessed
over these murders for years .
now that he &apos;s gotten a taste , he &apos;s gonna want to keep killing
and will take increased risks to do so .
as is evidenced by another murder on the heels of the first
and under the nose of police and federal investigators .
this guy gets off on the thrill as much as the killing .
125 residents have had their chips removed ,
but remember , it &apos;s possible that the unsub is not from here .
our analyst is searching for suspects outside of the community .
with your help we &apos;ll be
interviewing those residents without trackers .
thank you .
i hear you have a big decision to make .
yeah . one of the biggest of my life .
once a year , on my birthday ,
i go visit this killer in prison .
his idea , not mine , believe me .
he &apos;s the only one who knows where the bodies are buried .
he gives me a name ,
and i give a family some peace and closure .
but every time i sit across from him ,
treating him like a human being ,
it takes something out of me .
you can do something i can &apos;t do .
i think that &apos;s why the brass tapped you for this project .
it takes something out of me , too .
the scary thing is ,
sometimes i don &apos;t even notice it
till long after it &apos;s gone .
you know , this job ain &apos;t all milk and honey .
some days you lose .
some days you do things you don &apos;t want to do .
so ask yourself this--
where can you do the most good
and still do yourself the least harm ?
then make your decision .
my whole life is here , man .
i got no reason to leave , except for my job .
you recently missed several days of work . why was that ?
got doctors .
back doctor , knee doctor , neck doctor .
poked and prodded all damn day .
and i got the paperwork and the needle marks to prove it .
so , where were you the last two nights ?
i was at home .
are those blundstones ?
yes , they are .
anybody to confirm your whereabouts ?
my mom . do you wear an e ?
how about i boot you in the ass
and then you can tell me .
those are copies of my receipts for the last week .
restaurant , pharmacy .
nothing exciting .
it &apos;s gone , isn &apos;t it ?
what is ?
our home .
we can &apos;t stay .
and there &apos;s nowhere else we can build something like this .
reverend , when we find the guy did this--
it doesn &apos;t matter .
you know , we had 16 protests here last year ?
parents come by , yell at us
and throw rocks through the windows .
but they don &apos;t know these men and women the way i do ,
the way you do .
nobody here did this , but they won &apos;t believe that .
now our home is gone .
no . no , after this is all over , you can rebuild .
what if i was wrong about everything ?
i mean , in building this , i made us easier targets ?
reverend ,
without you , these people would have nowhere to go .
and if it hadn &apos;t been for me ,
paige would still be alive .
all the residents checked out , didn &apos;t they ?
every single one , with or without the tracking chip .
ok . where does that leave us ?
you know , the reverend said something that got me thinking .
this town is the perfect forensic countermeasure .
the unsub would have known
we &apos;d start investigating inside the circle ,
and that &apos;s exactly what we did .
to take advantage of that ,
this guy would have to be an outsider .
yeah . garcia , how are you doing investigating people
in the surrounding communities ?
well , it &apos;s still in its early stages .
the list is long and rather arduous .
it &apos;s no big shocker , there &apos;s a lot of people out there
who have vendettas against glenport village .
all right , there is one name that keeps cropping up .
ira stein . he lives right by glenport village .
he has been quite vocal about his dislike of the community .
he &apos;s been arrested twice for harassing residents .
i &apos;ll go talk to ira . thanks .
while you do , we need to take another look .
there &apos;s something or someone we missed .
sheriff , can you give us a hand ?
of course . one second , agent lewis . hey , guys .
dad , can one of the deputies show me how to fire a gun ?
we &apos;ll see , buddy . come on .
what are we doing here ?
&apos;cause we &apos;re all spending the night in my office .
i call couch !
what ? why ?
dad , what about the party ?
i &apos;m sorry , riley .
that is so unfair . you told me i could go .
hey , danny , why don &apos;t you , uh , get yourself some food
from the vending machine .
sure .
victoria taylor-- you know her ?
no . but i heard .
i need to make sure you two are safe .
so you &apos;re making me and danny literally rot in a prison ?
come on , riley . it &apos;s one night ,
and i need you to watch over your brother .
dad , this is insane .
our house is a fortress .
i mean , there are more guns at home than there are here .
besides , you know someone from perv ville did this .
no , i don &apos;t . not necessarily .
all i know for sure is whoever this is
has gone outside glenport village .
now , please , riley , help me do my job , ok ?
just one night .
fine .
hey , adam .
hey , can you go out ?
no . i &apos;m at my dad &apos;s work .
oh . well , we , uh , we got invited to greg &apos;s party .
we did ?
my dad &apos;s got me on lockdown .
can you sneak out ?
doubt it .
doesn &apos;t matter . i don &apos;t have a car .
oh , i &apos;ll pick you up .
you will ?
yeah , of course . just meet me outside the station in 20 .
ok .
hey , danny .
dad says you can &apos;t go .
i &apos;ll only be gone an hour . two , max .
my silence isn &apos;t free .
how much ?
two weeks with your computer .
rossi hit a dead end with ira stein ,
but the the reverend said it himself--
the reason the crime rate is so low in glenport village
is because the people there self @-@ police .
so someone there had to have seen the unsub .
wouldn &apos;t they come forward for the good of the community ?
the residents are like us . they watch , they profile .
the thing is , they didn &apos;t realize they saw him .
well , in that case , who &apos;s the most likely resident that did ?
i have an idea .
thanks for coming to get me .
i felt like the walls were closing in .
yeah , no problem .
wasn &apos;t that greg &apos;s ?
yeah . looks like there &apos;s no party .
hmm . maybe he got busted .
you know , uh , that &apos;s ok , &apos; cause ,
you know , i was thinking that maybe ...
uh ... you know , i should probably just get back to my dad &apos;s work .
no , that &apos;s ok , we &apos;re cool .
damn it , adam !
look , just take me back to the station--now .
you know what ? you can walk home .
are you kidding me ?
get out .
get out !
where &apos;s your sister ?
she left .
what , she left ? !
she said she &apos;d be back in an hour .
two , max .
riley &apos;s phone , leave a message .
danny , don &apos;t you move , all right ?
hey , riley .
hey , matt , is that you ?
yeah . what &apos;s going on ?
uh , greg &apos;s party got broken up .
oh , well , you know , there was an after party at michelle &apos;s .
um , heh , sorry you missed it .
hey , you need a ride ?
uh ... yeah .
uh , sorry , the seatbelt &apos;s broken .
oh , no worries . we &apos;re not going far .
i never should have left the station .
my dad &apos;s gonna be mad .
thanks for taking me back .
oh , uh , actually , the station &apos;s that way .
oh , i know .
yeah , but it &apos;s the other way .
matt ?
no , you &apos;re wrong , i didn &apos;t see anybody .
agent , i need your help .
sure .
randy , you were the last person to see paige alive .
yes .
ok .
so take me through your day .
tommy &apos;s bus dropped him off after school .
you watched him through paige &apos;s window .
then what happened ?
i walked back home .
ok . what did you do then ?
sometimes tommy plays outside ...
and i , uh , get a good look at him .
he doesn &apos;t have any friends .
it &apos;s not his fault .
who &apos;d let their child
come over for a playdate in glenport village ?
tommy must be lonely .
did he come outside that day ?
no .
you would have been hyper @-@ focused on looking for him ,
so any movement would have caught your eye .
what did you see ?
just a car .
what kind of car ?
i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s just a car .
play it over in your mind slowly .
is there anything about the car that stood out ?
it was gray .
there , uh , there was a sign on the side of it .
like a delivery car .
the sign read &quot; brain gang . &quot;
it was one of those guys
that comes to your house to fix your computers .
randy ...
that could be our unsub .
matt ?
no , no , no , how did you find ...
ok , you keep it in a bag on a hanger in your closet .
why are you doing this ?
searching for i.t. service reps who make house calls
in glenport village . give me more .
set your search parameters at 35 to 40
and see who &apos;s working glenport village .
those are some bang @-@ up parameters , brain brother .
checking , checking , and ...
nothing .
which ones overlap with victoria &apos;s neighborhood ?
second verse same as the first . sorry .
maybe it &apos;s not one of those guys .
what if randy was wrong ?
the details down to the color
were highly specific .
i mean , it &apos;s possible our profile &apos;s wrong ...
the age -- aren &apos;t i.t. reps usually younger ?
garcia , new age parameters . 18 to 25 .
i am in your headspace .
and i like what i see . i have 4 gentlemen
that match those parameters .
there &apos;s dave ermini , tyler otte , matt franks , and --
wait , hold on . matt -- matt franks ?
what is it ?
he &apos;s my next @-@ door neighbor .
he worked on my computer last week .
he &apos;s been in my house .
we profiled increased risk @-@ taking behavior .
5 years ago in georgia , matt franks was arrested
for stalking a girl in high school , a cheerleader .
charges were dropped . she left town .
two years after that , franks was brought in for questioning
regarding the murder of another teen , also a cheerleader ,
but detectives didn &apos;t have enough evidence on him .
lewis , get morgan and go .
wait , wait , wait . hold on for a second .
what are we looking at here ?
tell me , father to father .
these agents are the best .
in case matt and riley aren &apos;t there ,
i will stay behind here and coordinate .
why am i doing this ?
same question the other girls asked .
there &apos;s no cure for me .
all right ? and there &apos;s no cure for those guys
over in glenport village either .
the other girls ?
with the first ones , i was so impatient .
i mean , the woman in glenport was just ...
too old ,
and , um , victoria --
victoria did it all wrong .
but , um ,
let &apos;s hope that you get it right .
i will .
i will .
just ...
not here .
let &apos;s go to the bedroom .
here we are .
yeah . we &apos;re gonna have fun tonight .
yes , we are .
so , what &apos;s first ?
do your routine .
i need my pom poms .
well , where are they ?
they &apos;re just in the closet .
stop . why are your pom poms in your dad &apos;s closet ?
come on !
come on !
ohh ... no !
no , no , no !
lewis , we &apos;ll take the front , deputies take the back .
there &apos;s a side door . hopefully he didn &apos;t see it .
here &apos;s the keys .
there &apos;s also a combination lock . it &apos;s 22 @-@ 10 @-@ 13 .
‭ - no !
sheriff , sheriff !
back up . let us do this .
you ruined everything .
please ! please !
matt franks , fbi !
matt , we &apos;re going to talk through this , ok ?
talk ? talk about what ?
whatever you like .
i &apos;m trained to listen .
so , why don &apos;t we start with your parents .
my parents .
my parents ?
oh , get him off of me , please get him off of me !
where &apos;s my dad ?
he &apos;s right outside . are you all right ?
yeah , i &apos;m ok .
all right , come with me . come with me .
i was surprised you took that shot .
yeah , me , too .
it &apos;s your first time . you all right ?
yeah . um ...
just , uh , just tired .
that &apos;s how it is .
every time ?
lewis , he was gonna kill that little girl .
you did what you had to do .
yeah , i know .
tomorrow &apos;s a new day .
you are right about that .
well , it &apos;s a good thing you &apos;re staying .
well , you know , too .
come on , now .
sometimes the days are just rough .
that &apos;s what this job is .
and then sometimes you get to see that .
so what do you think ?
honestly , i don &apos;t know what to do .
i mean , i have to take this research project ,
but i don &apos;t want to leave the bau .
i actually think i &apos;m a better interviewer
now that you &apos;ve made me a better profiler .
well , what if you could do both --
coordinate a team and consult with us ?
you -- you &apos;d do that ?
of course .
the director &apos;s already approved it .
hey , i don &apos;t know what favors you called in , but --
it &apos;s not about favors .
it &apos;s about everything you &apos;ve brought to your time here .
when you find good people , you don &apos;t want to lose them .
thank you , sir .
&quot; to remain indifferent to the challenges we face
is indefensible .
if the goal is noble ,
whether or not it is realized within our lifetime
is largely irrelevant .
what we must do , therefore ,
is to strive and persevere
and never give up . &quot;
