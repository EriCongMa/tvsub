what was the deal with you the stefan ?
i was the first love of stefan &apos;s life .
stefan , meet julian .
julian was the man you are not supposed to fall for .
does stefan salvatore know that you are pregnant with his child ?
what ?
i wanted to tell you personally ,
but julian made sure there was nothing to tell .
please don &apos;t tell anyone .
i won &apos;t , i promise .
the phoenix stone brings people back from the dead .
we made a mistake . jo was never in that stone .
i put someone else in her body .
you &apos;re not my wife .
i don &apos;t think i am .
we &apos;ll figure this out together .
burying that bastard &apos;s body would &apos;ve been too good for lily .
i want to give her that man that she &apos;s missed for a hundred years ,
and then i want to rip his head off right in front of her .
julian is the devil . i can &apos;t let lily bring him back .
if she does , i will kill julian myself .
so tell me , what thoughts go through
a man &apos;s mind before he decides ,
&quot; i think i &apos;ll take the ones with the roosters &quot; ?
i didn &apos;t pick those out .
hang on . glitter .
yeah . well , it goes with the territory .
what the hell do you want , damon ?
when &apos;s the last time you talked to your fiancee ?
i see word travels fast .
she texted earlier today . why ?
what time was it , and what &apos;d she say ?
12 : 18-- &quot; do we need bread ? &quot;
well , she &apos;s not answering her phone now .
yeah . well , she doesn &apos;t like to answer the phone before a broadcast .
i don &apos;t care . get her on the horn .
stefan &apos;s being hunted again ,
and it &apos;s only a matter of time before caroline &apos;s the bait
that &apos;s used to lure him out .
move .
we apologize for the interruption to your current program .
my name is caroline .
i am a segment producer for &quot; kqbc news . &quot;
please listen carefully .
i have an urgent message for stefan salvatore .
oh , well .
i guess the old ball and chain won &apos;t
make it home for dinner , after all , will she ?
hold the gun . there you go .
now , the first thing you want to do ...
bite the paper off the cartridge like this .
hand me that ramrod . there you go .
now i want you to do it .
push it all the way down .
perfect .
how far away can i shoot ?
well , you see that , uh--
you see that tree over there with the bark falling off ?
no .
pretty far , then , huh ?
can i shoot it ?
i don &apos;t know . think you &apos;re old enough ?
i &apos;m 11 .
i was 12 when i shot my first gun .
dad , i can do it .
you think so ?
yeah .
all right . ok .
let &apos;s go find ourselves a deer . come on .
see , now , the trick is ,
never take your eye off the target .
got that ?
jacob .
jacob !
jacob !
jacob ! jacob !
hey , it &apos;s just me .
who &apos;s jacob ?
who ?
jacob . you were yelling his name .
oh , um , must have been a bad dream .
oh , probably because you &apos;re sleeping on the couch , silly .
what are you doing down here ?
that would be my fault .
i--i just wanted to let you know
i used the last of the shampoo .
valerie , i didn &apos;t know that you were staying here .
stayed , past tense , um , just one night .
i should go put some clothes on .
yeah . you do that .
all right .
ok .
explain .
ok .
lily wants to raise julian from the dead .
valerie tried to scorch his body
before she can get her hands on him ,
and that did not work out so well .
not following how that &apos;s our problem .
ok . if and when lily welcomes julian back into his body ,
he will find out what valerie did , and he &apos;ll come after her .
yeah . just not connecting those dots .
well , maybe you can just trust me
that i know what i &apos;m doing .
so what you &apos;re saying is , valerie needs to disappear--
new name , new job ,
a country in a separate hemisphere .
no . no .
well , you just said that she &apos;s in danger .
i mean , if i need to drive her to the airport myself ,
i will do that .
unless you have a problem with that .
uh , you know , i-- i really like this form of manipulation .
whatever we &apos;re doing , we should do it fast .
the phoenix stone turns people mad ,
and julian &apos;s soul &apos;s been in it for over a hundred years ,
so anywhere he is , i need to be as far away as possible .
see , beau , fencing &apos;s got to flow--
like a conversation .
i speak . you listen .
i speak some more .
you &apos;ve improved . well done , friend .
gentlemen ...
our back yard &apos;s not big enough ?
beau insisted , didn &apos;t you , friend ?
take it outside , please .
well , you heard this ridiculously attractive woman .
you are suspiciously cheery .
are you sure you shouldn &apos;t still be in bed ?
my love , i need to be on my feet again .
i spent the last hundred years on my back ,
so unless you can make an offer that i cannot refuse--
ok .
tempting ,
but i have another idea .
and i like it already .
we have enemies here .
you mean valerie .
that name is not to be uttered in this house .
i am referring to my sons .
your sons are alive ?
ok . well , i have some catching up to do .
my thoughts exactly .
&quot; lily salvatore requests your presence
to celebrate our town &apos;s peaceful spirit
and introduce a new friend--
this evening , 5 : 00 . &quot;
hmm , looks like mom raised her man crush from the dead .
i promise to be with you and love you .
remember when we used an ancient relic
to raise your wife from the dead
and ended up imbuing her with someone else &apos;s soul ?
why are you calling me ?
because i &apos;m at scull bar ,
where faux jo is currently holding her laptop like it &apos;s a book .
you promised me you would help her
figure out who she was before she did anything crazy .
yeah , and every time i look into her eyes ,
i see my murdered wife , so i &apos;m taking a break .
i know this is probably impossible for you .
we have no idea what &apos;s gonna happen to her .
we can &apos;t just leave her unattended .
well , just keep an eye on her , then .
i can &apos;t . i have to go to mystic falls .
lily salvatore is having some peace party mixer
which &apos;ll probably result in half of my friends
nearly dying if i don &apos;t attend ,
so get here now , preferably before someone
asks jo to perform surgery , ok ?
ah , go no tie , i &apos;m going no tie .
not just no tie , no going .
you saw her invite . julian &apos;s back . you &apos;re going .
to watch lily bat her eyes
at her zombie douche brain boy toy ?
thanks , but i &apos;d rather stay home
and stub my toe repeatedly .
you do realize that zombie douche brain boy toy
is living in your house , bathing in your tub ,
eating your froot loops .
oh , i know .
i also know that he &apos;s the love of mom &apos;s life ,
mom , who convinced kai to link elena &apos;s life
with bonnie &apos;s so i &apos;d be miserable
for the next 6 @-@ plus decades .
what are you getting at ?
julian makes her happy , stefan .
more time they spend together , the happier she gets ,
the more tragic it &apos;ll be in 6 months
when i hand @-@ deliver his heart to her .
6 months ?
yeah , you know , give or take .
let her get her hopes up .
let her start planning their entire eternity ,
and then , squish , he &apos;s dead .
that might be a bit of a problem , brother ,
because i plan on killing the bastard tonight .
seattle looks nice .
hey , they got the space needle ,
great coffee , mount st . helens .
rain .
didn &apos;t take you much of a sunshine person .
um , i mean , there &apos;s always indonesia .
oh , you could rent a hut on the beach
and drink out of coconuts .
be 9,000 miles from your boyfriend in either direction .
let &apos;s put a pin in locations for a moment
and talk names because valerie tulle
is way too traceable .
i &apos;m thinking ... matilda .
oh , you could totally pull off matilda--
matilda pettigrew
from liverpool , england .
what , do you want to write it down ?
you &apos;re handling me like i &apos;m a wounded bird ,
like i &apos;m some sort of victim , but i &apos;m not .
when stefan kills julian , he can &apos;t hurt anyone else ,
and i can just put this whole mess behind me .
what mess ?
you know , the whole reason i &apos;m afraid of julian ,
my big secret , the entire horror story .
stefan must have told you .
he promised me he wouldn &apos;t tell anyone ,
but i didn &apos;t know that that included you .
well , his loyalty certainly is attractive , isn &apos;t it ?
ok . i &apos;m sorry . what didn &apos;t he tell me ?
never mind .
as you were saying ,
uh , matilda pettigrew from liverpool , hmm ?
that &apos;s good . i like it .
so you just line up those matching pieces of candy
like so .
there you go . you got it .
it took mary louise a month to pass the first level .
and this is meant to be , like , fun , right ?
oh , yeah .
give it another 5 minutes , you &apos;ll be full @-@ on addicted .
i think this era suits you , nora .
well , i wouldn &apos;t know .
lily keeps us trapped inside the town border .
there &apos;s nothing here for us .
well , i think she &apos;s just nervous
to let her little birdies fly free .
she doesn &apos;t want another valerie on her hands .
well , valerie &apos;s a traitor ,
and lily knows she and i are nothing alike .
no . you certainly are not .
perhaps i could talk to lily ,
see if i can &apos;t convince her
to loosen her reins a little .
you would do that ?
of course .
there you are . guests are arriving .
help me greet them ?
you &apos;re greeting them dressed like that ?
what &apos;s wrong with it ?
absolutely nothing , mary louise .
you look stunning , as always .
am i allowed in , or does your cleaning lady need to invite me ?
we had her sign the house over to us .
she was too expensive . come in .
thank you .
compliments of the lockwood cellar .
oh , thank you .
ooh , where did all these people come from ?
neighboring towns .
we promised them a night of drink and conversation .
ah , so you compelled them .
i wanted to show you what peace looks like .
my family is civilized .
none of these people are in danger .
what ? no tie ?
what are you doing here ?
i missed my stash .
boys , why don &apos;t you go mingle ?
i &apos;ll put this away .
tell me that you are here to help me .
you know how you wanted to , uh , redecorate ?
can &apos;t let you do that .
why the hell not ?
because lily just rearranged the furniture
and she needs a little time to live in it ,
you know , fall in love with the whole feng shui of it all .
yeah . let me guess-- for 6 months .
ok . i give up . what am i missing here ?
why do you care so much ?
let &apos;s just say that the furniture
lily recently purchased is psychotic
and needs to be disposed of immediately .
gentlemen , welcome .
i &apos;m julian .
i &apos;m damon .
lily told me all about you .
of course , you were only a boy back then ,
and now you &apos;re , well , you .
stefan , how long has it been ?
i don &apos;t know .
i must have lost track after i stopped thinking about you .
huh , my charm is being lost on you .
you must be dreadfully sober .
beau , get these men something to drink , will you ?
deputy donovan . welcome .
it &apos;s matt .
we lost all formalities when you and your girlfriend
nearly drained me of all my blood .
ok . look .
the whole point of this shindig is to start over , so--
got a better idea .
why don &apos;t you convince your family to leave mystic falls ?
and why would i do that ?
why would a group of vampires hang around
an abandoned town with nothing to eat ?
what are we talking about ?
apparently , matt is sick of us .
i just want my town back ,
preferably before anyone else dies .
look around . look at all these people .
they &apos;re still alive , aren &apos;t they ?
at least till the dessert course .
you &apos;re making it worse .
come on . let &apos;s go meet people .
oh , did whatever animal
they &apos;re serving for dinner get a plus @-@ one ?
hilarious . i was invited .
you &apos;re scoping the competition .
there is not competition to scope .
since you &apos;re here ,
if anyone &apos;s wondering , you &apos;re my date .
sorry ?
lorenzo , i &apos;m so glad you came .
wouldn &apos;t miss it .
bonnie , i know we &apos;ve had a rocky past ,
but i hope this means you &apos;re willing to start fresh .
you &apos;re the reason i &apos;m never gonna see my best friend again ,
so i hope you &apos;re joking .
nice break .
well , it is my pool table , after all .
ah , damon , come play with us .
oh , i would , but i have an irrational fear of pool tables .
it &apos;s not a rational fear of losing ?
wait . has he nev--
have you never heard the story about the guy
that tries to kill the vampire during a game of pool ?
well , considering my body &apos;s been in stasis for a century ,
why don &apos;t you enlighten me ?
well , there &apos;s this guy .
he &apos;s about stefan &apos;s build , maybe a wee bit bigger ,
little more chiseled , less height on the hair .
get on with the story .
right , so this vampire that he wants to kill
is at least 300 years older than him ,
and anyone and everyone with half a brain
knew he was being an idiot ,
but he had this inexplicable obsession ,
so he bets the vampire in a game of pool ,
and just as the vamp is setting up for his last shot ...
and ?
never got a chance .
yeah . another vampire comes out of nowhere and stops him .
like i said , he was being an idiot .
wow , that is a wonderful story , hemmingway .
thanks .
i see you &apos;ve mastered the internet .
one of these students showed me something called webmd .
apparently , i have a form of retrograde amnesia .
so far , i &apos;ve cancelled out encephalitis
and paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis .
most of my characteristics fall under fugue @-@ state amnesia ,
which is rare , but then again ,
so is coming back from the dead ,
which i just said too loudly .
what ?
nothing .
dr. laughlin , you &apos;re back .
i thought you were on sabbatical .
laura homested ,
one of your interns at the med center last semester .
oh , right .
you remember laura , who you mentioned to me , right ?
laura my star pupil .
really ? you gave me a &quot; c. &quot;
anyway , how was your honeymoon ?
amazing , wasn &apos;t it , ric ?
yeah , uh , fantastic .
oh , dr. laughlin , y--your nose .
your nose is bleeding .
oh , hey , do you mind getting us some napkins ?
yeah . i &apos;ll be right back .
what the hell is wrong with me ?
* my lover *
i hate to interrupt the party ,
but i just wanted to introduce my dearest love julian .
he &apos;s just returned from , shall we say , travels abroad .
my family is finally complete .
my hope now is that in time ,
we can learn to accept each other
and , together , restore this town
with its residents to a state of peace .
cheers .
cheers .
cheers .
beau , can i ask you something ?
lily &apos;s concerns about me weren &apos;t entirely wrong .
my time away might have affected my head a bit ,
nothing to worry about , of course ,
but , um , there is a little something
that would bring me great relief .
our dearly departed oscar had something of mine ,
but it wasn &apos;t on him when he died ,
so i thought perhaps it was in his automobile .
could you maybe figure out where it was sent ?
great .
we haven &apos;t met .
julian .
lorenzo .
those meat @-@ and @-@ cheese spirals were decadent .
your staff does fantastic work .
i &apos;ll send them your compliments .
it &apos;s called dignity . have some . it &apos;s free .
oh , what i got in return was priceless .
julian is looking for oscar &apos;s car .
i intend to find it first .
what are you doing ?
lily is watching .
i am fixing your tie , making her jealous
like any good date .
that &apos;s what you wanted , right ,
make her a little jealous ?
maybe a little .
anyway , i got what i came for .
have a nice night .
her nose just started to bleed , and--
and then that started .
oh , here .
take my blood .
drink . it &apos;ll heal you .
or not .
what the hell &apos;s wrong with her ?
seems a vampire soul inside a human body
does not a perfect match make .
what does that mean ?
the phoenix stone traps vampire souls .
oscar had a vampire body ,
got some other vampire &apos;s soul ,
and he lost the plot .
jo was a human .
clearly , a basic human body is unable to contain
the essence of a vampire soul .
you add that together , carry the one ,
you &apos;re a decomposing mess .
thank you , valerie .
your tact is wildly appreciated .
i was just saying that she was a corpse
who was meant to stay a corpse .
we know . we heard you , but that corpse
was supposed to be ric &apos;s wife who died
with two kids inside of her on their wedding day .
sorry . i-- i had no idea .
yeah . well , now you do , so just sit down quietly
while he says good @-@ bye .
ah , what a pretty dress .
do you think ? nora didn &apos;t even notice .
well , nora needs her eyes examined .
she &apos;s talking to everyone at this party but me .
i feel like a fool running around
trying to impress my own girlfriend .
stand still and say nothing .
why don &apos;t you drink
what you &apos;re actually craving ?
lily would have my head .
no feeding on the guests .
she practically made us sign on oath in our blood .
mm , just as i expected .
what ?
you , mary louise , have lost your swagger .
the girl i remember had spunk , vigor ,
danger , rules be damned .
no wonder nora &apos;s bored .
mm , i won &apos;t tell this if you won &apos;t .
mare , did you change ?
you &apos;re looking very scarlett johan--
excuse me . can you tell me where the high school is ?
oh , the entire town &apos;s shut down .
you haven &apos;t noticed the million signs ?
yeah . i &apos;m looking for the high school .
yeah . i heard you the first time . why ?
uh , can you tell me where the high school is ?
who you been talking to ?
uh , i can &apos;t say .
if my boss is looking for me , can you tell him i quit ?
what was that about ?
i don &apos;t know , but i get the impression
he didn &apos;t , either .
we should follow him ...
unless you have other plans .
this &apos;ll only take a minute .
i &apos;ll meet you at my truck .
where the hell &apos;s your tv ?
where &apos;s my bed ?
guess lily took over your bedroom ,
and i will bet you your old flat @-@ screen
that julian is not sleeping in the guest quarters .
here , i thought she slept standing up
like a horse .
you need to help me kill him ,
or you need to leave .
do you know what this means ?
knock it off .
it means mom &apos;s happy .
another couple of months of this ,
and she &apos;ll have convinced herself it &apos;s forever ,
and that &apos;s when we strike , stefan .
look at your bedroom .
our house is unrecognizable .
lily needs to go , and killing julian
is the start of that .
you know something .
look at you-- murdery , vengeful .
it &apos;s very humanity @-@ off , stefan ,
except your switch is intact , which means
you know something , so spit it out .
it &apos;s not my secret to tell , damon .
oh , really ?
so nora showed me where they keep the good stuff .
hang on .
no . it says , &quot; damon &apos;s good stuff .
do not touch . &quot;
take bonnie . get out of here .
it &apos;s about to get ugly .
my brother told the story wrong .
julian !
what did i do to make you hate me so much ?
it &apos;s not about you .
not about me ?
ever since i &apos;ve been back , all you have done
is try to strip me of my happiness .
answer me . what did i do wrong ?
i see stefan &apos;s plan went swimmingly .
probably explains why your fake guests are leaving .
sit down , both of you .
oh , well , we wouldn &apos;t want to wear out our welcome .
brother , let &apos;s hit the road .
sit down , son ,
or i &apos;ll seat you myself .
ok .
hmm , over a hundred years
inside this thing , although in this ,
my own custom @-@ made hell ,
time is meaningless .
the pain , the emptiness ,
the complete lack of humanity
is quite literally endless .
no . every day is the same .
i wake up .
i try to escape , but instead ,
i end up killing the person
that i love the most .
every day , over and over again ,
i drive a stake through your mother .
it &apos;s almost enough to turn even the soundest mind mad ,
but when you &apos;re over 475 years old ,
you learn a thing or two about yourself .
this couldn &apos;t be real because i would never
bring harm to your mother .
hell was playing tricks on me , hmm ?
it was trying to break me , but , no ,
i wouldn &apos;t let it because i knew
that if i did snap--
ooh , no , no--
i wouldn &apos;t be a man .
i &apos;d be a monster .
julian .
your children have no respect for you .
julian !
knock it off .
ah ! julian . julian .
julian .
boys , out now .
i wonder what webmd
would have to say about me now .
it &apos;s probably best not to find out .
a woman was wielding a sword that pierced my heart .
the blade was metal .
it shouldn &apos;t have been able to kill me , but it did .
did you just remember this ?
i also remembered my name .
i think i &apos;m florence .
well , it &apos;s nice to meet you , florence .
i am so sorry that i put you through this .
it &apos;s ok .
i know you want your wife back .
i &apos;m sorry i &apos;m not her .
i wish i was . she was a lucky woman .
you would have been an amazing husband .
it &apos;s been so nice--
it &apos;s been so nice to hear her voice again .
thank you .
thank you for allowing me to say good @-@ bye .
good @-@ bye , ric .
hey , hey , what are you doing here ?
he did actually see us , didn &apos;t he ?
all right , everybody . please stand up .
we &apos;re gonna get you out of here , ok ?
it &apos;s not gonna work , matt .
someone compelled them to be here .
sanguinem filio ,
sanguinem effugarex perpetuum ...
do you want the white sheet or the off @-@ white sheet ?
i don &apos;t care . you choose .
effugarex perpetuum ...
what are you doing ?
what is that ?
it &apos;s my wedding video postexplosion .
i &apos;ve never been able to watch it past the wedding vows .
valerie , turn it off . wait .
i recognize this chant .
that gemini kid kai thought
they were sending him to a prison world .
who cares ? turn it off .
no . you &apos;re not listening .
they weren &apos;t sending him away , caroline .
they were trying to save
the next generation of gemini twins .
i think your babies are still alive .
he &apos;s still alive ,
so i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re moping about .
no talking until i &apos;m seeing two of you .
then i &apos;ll kick both of your asses .
this is why there is a hard line between good and evil , stefan .
i don &apos;t cross over into your territory .
don &apos;t cross over into mine .
this isn &apos;t about you , damon . get over it .
you know , i never thought i &apos;d say this , stefan ,
but i miss the days
when you just let your big brother handle all the dirty work .
quite frankly , i can &apos;t figure out
why you have such a big beef with this guy ,
unless v @-@ card valerie got under your skin .
you don &apos;t want to start with me right now , damon .
i &apos;m surprised , stefan .
i thought caroline was the one ,
and yet , again , we all thought elena was the one , huh ?
what is it about the first time
that just makes it so memorable ?
i got valerie pregnant ...
what ?
in 1863 .
julian found out about it ,
and he beat her until the baby was no longer alive .
i could &apos;ve been a father .
why didn &apos;t you just tell me ?
what &apos;d you want me to do ,
tell you i could &apos;ve had a kid
and watch you brush it off with some glib joke about
how it was 150 years ago ?
yeah . i know it was 150 years ago , damon ,
and it &apos;s stupid how much it affects me ,
but it still does .
i want him dead , damon .
no one &apos;s gonna stop me from killing him--
not in 6 months , not in 6 weeks--
now .
twins are the lifeblood of the gemini coven .
if a pregnant mother is in danger ,
then the transfer is our magical failsafe .
it &apos;s rarely used but used nonetheless .
ric , tell me that this isn &apos;t crazy .
my wife , who died months ago ,
just looked me in the eyes and said good @-@ bye to me .
why the hell not ?
because i don &apos;t want you to get your hopes up
for something that &apos;s insane .
i need your blood .
now put it here-- indonesia ,
farthest geographical point from mystic falls .
your progeny are , obviously , made up of your dna .
if they &apos;re alive , the blood will travel along the map .
once it &apos;s in the proximity of the babies ,
the map should ignite .
close your eyes . clear your mind .
phesmatos quare infantatum .
phesmatos quare filios .
ado finet terraeum .
nunc temos rogamus .
combutis et sanguinem .
phesmatos quare infantatum .
may i ask you something ?
did julian remind you of anyone in particular tonight ?
the almighty giuseppe salvatore .
you saw it , too .
yep , although i will say ,
julian &apos;s right hook
has got a little more heft to it .
elena and i talked about starting a family .
i mean , it was fantasy , but still ,
we secretly knew as long as she was a vampire ,
it &apos;s all it was .
then she took the cure , and all of a sudden ,
having a real family was a possibility .
granted , it &apos;d be dysfunctional as hell ,
but we &apos;d have a real human family .
did it ever scare you ,
the thought that maybe
you &apos;d turn out like our father ?
the guy sent our mom away to die alone .
he bullied us for years , and then he shot us .
if anything , i just want to be a great dad to spite him .
what about you ?
well , i &apos;ve been on this earth for 160 @-@ some years ,
and i &apos;ve seen the world at 30,000 feet .
i &apos;ve traveled to every continent
and learned how to cook ,
built a porsche .
i think my only regret
would be not having a kid .
if you want julian dead , i &apos;ll help you .
tomorrow , tonight , now ...
i &apos;m in .
what the hell happened down there ?
you were in a blind rage .
rage ?
we offered them escargot and wine ,
and your boy threw me in the fire ,
so he &apos;s lucky that he still has his head .
they were just trying to hurt me , all right ?
look . the whole point of tonight was
to end this feud , not start a new one .
why do you care what they think ?
the lily that i remember moved on from her children .
where &apos;s the girl that i fell in love with ,
the girl that i found irresistible ?
i can &apos;t say that i recognize this version .
this version has no desire to see her children dead .
if you have a problem with that ,
we have a problem .
lily ...
perhaps i &apos;m more affected by my time away
than i wanted to admit .
you know i was wishing that the hell had gone away ,
but my mind , it &apos;s not right .
i mean , the truth is ,
i &apos;m frightened that
i &apos;m not the julian that you remember .
we &apos;ll fix it .
we &apos;ll fix it together , all right ,
but you must promise me
nothing like that will ever happen again .
well , in the meantime ...
i need to feel safe .
your kids will strike again ,
and i need to protect myself .
what i believe you have in mind
will take the cooperation of the entire family .
it will ,
but i don &apos;t anticipate that to be a problem .
they love me .
finet terraeum .
nunc temos rogamus .
combutis et sanguinem .
phesmatos quare infantatum .
ado finet terraeum .
nunc temos rogamus .
combutis et sanguinem .
phesmatos quare filios .
guys , i don &apos;t think it &apos;s working .
nunc temos rogamus .
combutis et sanguinem .
guys , stop . the spell isn &apos;t working , ok ?
the blood &apos;s just off the map now .
see ? i warned you not to get your hopes up .
oh , my god !
ok . what the hell happened ?
not possible .
what &apos;s not possible ?
babies . they &apos;re here .
where , huh , floating in a raft
in the pacific ocean somewhere ?
look at the map . your spell didn &apos;t work .
they &apos;re not on the map , caroline .
they &apos;re inside of you .
