people are really romantic about the beginnings of things .
fresh start ...
clean slate ...
it &apos;s not gonna work .
maybe it doesn &apos;t want to set up shop in hostile uterus .
no , it &apos;s gonna happen .
we just have to keep doing it until we get it right , right ?
right .
you bring you into every new beginning in your life .
so how different can it possibly be ?
damn it .
torres ! come on ! let &apos;s go !
coming .
what the hell ?
oh , good morning .
what are you doing here ?
oh , i bought out our subletters .
i &apos;m moving back in . hooray .
okay . they weren &apos;t your subletters .
they were my subletters .
well , now , uh , i &apos;m your subletter .
hooray ?
my lack of interest in seeing you is not a strategy .
i &apos;m not , uh , i &apos;m not playing hard to get .
i don &apos;t want to see you ,
because i turned my life upside @-@ down for you ,
and you walked away , because , for a week , i was cranky .
you &apos;re untrustworthy , so i don &apos;t want to see you .
you &apos;re self @-@ centered , so i don &apos;t want to see you .
i am 100 % certain that if i let you back into my life again ,
you will hurt me again ,
so i don &apos;t want to see you .
this isn &apos;t a ploy . i &apos;m not--i &apos;m not pouting .
i don &apos;t want you in my life .
get your crap
out of my apartment .
it &apos;s good that she &apos;s mad .
it means she cares , right ?
try again . could be a false negative .
maybe you tried too early .
what is it , day ten ?
yeah .
yeah , totally early . pee on a bunch of different sticks .
don &apos;t let the one stick win .
well , it &apos;s a scientific test .
i hardly think i can bend it to my will .
i &apos;m doing three surgeries today .
i did four yesterday . i &apos;m unstoppable .
and you got defeated by a piece of plastic covered in urine ?
buck up .
what is this , everybody got paged ?
it &apos;s that time of year again .
the chicks have hatched .
is that some sort of a code ?
those chicks .
oh , first @-@ year med students . too dumb to find the toilet .
good morning .
behind me stand the interns and residents of tomorrow .
today you will show them what it &apos;s like to be a surgeon .
when you go into surgery , they go into surgery .
when they have a question , you will answer .
it &apos;s like court @-@ ordered community service .
i &apos;d rather be picking up trash off the side of the highway .
fred wilson , you &apos;re with dr. yang .
kira donnelley , with dr. grey .
hudson powell , with dr. kepner .
laurel pinson ...
mine .
mine .
laurel , you &apos;re ... with dr. karev .
edward taylor , dr. avery .
really ?
kim peterson , you &apos;re with dr. hall ...
hey , man .
dr. yang ,
um , you were out of the game for a while ,
so you &apos;ll be with me on my service today .
i &apos;d like to monitor your progress .
i think you &apos;ll be pleased .
i don &apos;t doubt it .
i will be picking my chief resident in a few months ....
and you &apos;re still a prime candidate .
the race for chief resident is on ?
since when ?
uh , how long have you been evaluating us ?
since your first day here .
let &apos;s go .
sorry .
when you gotta go , you gotta go .
okay , we are with shepherd today . he &apos;s neuro .
is he nice ?
uh , he &apos;s my husband , so i have to say he &apos;s nice ,
but he &apos;s also a damn good surgeon .
oh , thank god .
i &apos;m just glad you &apos;re not one of those
&quot; obsessed with my job , but cold and dead inside &quot; surgeons .
we have rounds .
henry burton has von hippel @-@ lindau disease
and a pheochromocytoma .
it &apos;s extremely rare , causes blood pressures to sky rocket ,
and it &apos;s treated with alpha blockers .
look at that . he reads .
sorry . should i--
med students are like children at the dinner table--
to be seen and not heard .
dr. yang .
sir .
uh , good to see you , henry .
thanks . i , uh , wore my best gown for the occasion .
i am dr. bailey . i &apos;ll be working with dr. webber today .
i feel like i already know you , dr. bailey .
eli here has been telling me all about you .
e--
don &apos;t worry . i didn &apos;t tell him everything .
okay . i did not know that you were on this case .
sure you didn &apos;t .
no , i did--
bailey , what ...
no , sorry , sir . um ...
wh @-@ where was i ?
dr. yang will run , uh ,
scans , and then we &apos;ll be ready to go .
sounds like an idyllic day .
who &apos;s he ?
nobody .
i mean , uh , he &apos;s ...
he &apos;s here observing . ignore him .
mr. wilson is a first @-@ year med student ,
and dr. yang is showing him the ropes .
uh , have you told mr. wilson
about the most interesting aspects of the case ?
he &apos;s been brought up to speed .
did she tell you that henry here originally was denied this surgery
because he was uninsured ?
um , no . i mean , she didn &apos;t mention ... that .
uh , that &apos;s too bad ...
about the insurance .
well , i got married . i &apos;m on my wife &apos;s insurance now .
oh , congratulations .
your girlfriend finally wised up , huh ?
uh , nope .
uh , sorry . um , i &apos;ll-- i &apos;ll come back later .
no , no , it &apos;s okay . i &apos;ve got the , uh , forms right here .
just a few signatures , and we &apos;re good to go .
great . great .
um , i &apos;ll have them back to you in a couple of hours .
great , thanks .
that &apos;s my wife .
upgrade , right ?
the ex was a cater waiter .
dr. torres .
what ? !
nothing .
well , you said my name .
just as a , you know , good @-@ morning type thing .
where &apos;s the stupid meat wagon ?
morning , dr. hunt .
doctor--
don &apos;t .
i &apos;ve got the crash cart standing by !
brady sullivan , 32 .
stable vital signs , complaints of neck and back pains .
possible crush injuries . he was trampled by a horse .
a horse ?
a @-@ a team of horses , like -- like three horses ,
if that helps you at all .
please , please don &apos;t let him die on our wedding day .
push 5 morphine .
we were going downtown this morning
to sign our domestic partnership papers ...
there &apos;s a lot of bruising here .
and i had a horse @-@ drawn carriage
to pick us up from city hall
and -- and bagpipers , because brady is scottish ,
and he really likes being scottish .
okay , i feel tenderness at c @-@ 6 .
get x @-@ ray in here , stat .
brady , i am so sorry . the bagpipers started up ,
and they spooked the horses , and -- and they ran .
over me . they all ran over me , kyle .
bagpipes ?
all right , exam shows weakness in lower extremities .
i &apos;ve got diminished reflexes .
move . i can &apos;t work .
dude ...
sorry , sorry .
i agreed to the tuxes , but horses ?
it was supposed to be a surprise .
it was .
okay . yeah . looks like l @-@ 4 and l @-@ 5 are affected .
page shepherd . all right , let &apos;s get him ready for ct .
sir , i need you outta here now .
i want to stay with him . i have a right to stay with him .
avery , get him outta here now .
move .
sorry . oh , my g -- - okay , everybody out . now .
now ! before i have to take someone out .
you married a patient to give him insurance ?
have you lost your mind ?
insurance fraud is a serious offense .
actually ,
according to the national medical anti @-@ fraud association ,
it &apos;s not insurance fraud , it &apos;s just frowned upon .
it &apos;s highly unethical . you &apos;re a doctor , for god &apos;s sakes .
the medical community is fairly split on this .
is it more unethical to deny a patient lifesaving care
or to marry a patient and give him that care ?
it can get murky .
don &apos;t you have somewhere to be , dr. grey ?
i &apos;m on dr. altman &apos;s service today .
we are doctors .
we save people &apos;s lives every day without marrying them .
you marry someone you love .
well , i love him . i do .
i mean , i love him ... so much .
dr. altman , this isn &apos;t a joke .
i appreciate your concern , chief , but it &apos;s done .
he has insurance , you &apos;re his doctor ,
and now you can save his life .
please don &apos;t tell the chief i said this ,
but i think what you did was awesome .
i mean , i get it .
she &apos;s got a hang @-@ up about me being perfect .
you know , everything comes easy for me ,
and i don &apos;t have any flaws ,
and now that i &apos;ve clearly made a mistake ,
she &apos;s just gonna pound the crap out of it .
so you don &apos;t think you &apos;re perfect ?
no . i have lots of flaws . i &apos;m competitive ,
i &apos;m a workaholic , i smoke when i &apos;m stressed .
it &apos;s disgusting .
well , i &apos;m sure she &apos;d love to hear all those ,
along with any other real faults you come up with .
you were that guy on &lt; i &gt; seattle med &lt; / i &gt; , right ?
the one who made a trachea from scratch .
well , stem cells , not scratch .
but yeah , that &apos;s -- that &apos;s me .
badass .
i &apos;m really interested in regenerative medicine .
yeah ?
i &apos;ll show you a bladder
we &apos;re growing in the lab
after rounds .
okay .
ladies first .
you &apos;re her teacher , alex .
only for the day .
uh , sarah cassidy , 15 , has a rare genetic condition
called treacher collins syndrome ...
which caused her to be born without cheek bones ,
leaving her orbital floor unprotected ,
and vulnerable to eye injury .
which means the only extracurriculars
i can sign up for are the ones
that don &apos;t involve things flying at my face .
she rocks the chess club .
i just want play sports .
you bowl , honey .
not really a sport , dad .
you , uh , you mind if i take a look ?
scoot over a little so laurel can see .
sarah , we &apos;re going to take pieces from your skull
and transplant them into your face
to rebuild new cheekbones .
do you have any questions or concerns ?
volleyball tryouts are in two months . can i tryout ?
hey . sorry i &apos;m late .
here are the forms . you are officially insured .
amazing . and i have nothing to give you in return .
wait . are you hungry ?
you want a fruit cup ?
henry ,
you needed insurance . i was happy to give it .
come on . take the fruit cup .
fine , i am starving .
that &apos;s disgusting .
yeah . i wouldn &apos;t eat it if i were dying .
i should go . um ...
good luck with your surgery .
thank you , dr. altman .
wow . a volleyball player .
digging into her skull will tack on
an extra year of healing , you know ?
well , maybe she &apos;ll play in a couple of years , then .
well , did you consider the stem cell surgery
they did in cincinnati using a cadaver bone graft ?
oh , it &apos;s too experimental .
i think it &apos;s worth considering given her age .
i think considering her age ,
it &apos;s best to be conservative .
i &apos;ll see you in surgery .
can we , uh , go in and see the scans ?
pretty small room . let &apos;s just wait .
he &apos;s got tandem lesions ,
a fracture translocation at l @-@ 4 and 5,
and a unilateral jumped facet at c @-@ 5 and 6 .
what does that mean ?
it means one of the joints in his neck
was knocked out of place ,
and he &apos;s got a broken back .
that one &apos;s your husband ?
what ? yes .
can i just say , jackpot ?
i mean , you get to be at work with that all day
and go home to him at night ?
i &apos;m gonna go see where they &apos;re at .
i &apos;m worried about his neck .
i don &apos;t think he should be intubated
with a cervical injury .
well i could do a little traction .
snap it back in before we do surgery .
hell of a wedding day .
mm .
they say if you want to piss off god ,
just tell him your plans .
dude , out , out , out .
that is the biggest pheo i &apos;ve ever seen .
is it infiltrating the kidney there ?
is that -- that -- that &apos;s the spleen , right ?
no , that &apos;s the liver .
oh . okay , so is that the tumor ?
that &apos;s a gall bladder .
wait . really ?
cross my heart . hope to die .
the image is reversed on an mri .
it &apos;s confusing at first .
i &apos;m sure dr. yang can remember seeing her first mri
and empathize .
empathy is a good quality for a chief resident ,
don &apos;t you think , dr. bailey ?
oh , i do , sir .
this is from the feet looking up ,
so that &apos;s the kidney ,
that &apos;s the adrenal gland , and that is the tumor .
that &apos;s the tumor ? it -- it &apos;s eating into the kidney .
right . i was hoping
we &apos;d only have to remove the adrenal gland .
but it looks like
i &apos;m gonna have to take henry &apos;s kidney as well .
dr. shepherd will decompress the nerve roots from behind ,
and then i will put in a graft and a plate for stabilization .
but before any of that can happen ,
we need to move your neck back into place .
fun .
i &apos;ll be done before you know it .
sir , you probably don &apos;t want to be here for this .
no , i &apos;m staying .
kyle , don &apos;t overdo it .
you always--
there &apos;s gonna be a lot of , um--
i &apos;m staying . it &apos;s my fault he &apos;s here .
if he &apos;s in pain , i &apos;ll be here with him .
stop trying to kick me out .
no , you &apos;re right . you should stay .
hold his hand .
okay .
thank you .
okay , brady ,
you ready ?
okay .
okay . one , two ... three .
so how &apos;d my tumor look ?
we don &apos;t have , uh , the results from all the scans yet .
i &apos;ve had 11 operations in the past 3 years .
i have tumors removed as a hobby .
i know how this works .
you know the results , but you can &apos;t tell me .
so give me a hint . i mean , look ,
are we talking marble , grapefruit , basketball ?
dr. webber will be up shortly to discuss the results of the scan .
come on , fred . what &apos;d you see ?
no , he &apos;s a first @-@ year med student .
he can &apos;t even read a scan .
then why does he look like he &apos;s gonna piss himself ?
look at his face . he &apos;s sweating .
what &apos;s going on ? am i gonna die ?
no , i &apos;m not--my face ...
it--don &apos;t let me--
&apos;cause i &apos;m just-- like she said , pretend i &apos;m--
stop talking .
what &apos;d you see , fred ?
nothing .
it &apos;s gonna be okay . truly .
my uncle had his kidney removed , and he &apos;s--
what ?
oh , god . i &apos;m sorry .
stop talking . mr. burton--
you have to remove my kidney ?
do you ? do you have to take out my kidney ?
the tumor on your adrenal gland has compromised your kidney .
it &apos;s enough damage that we need to remove it .
i know . it--it sounds like a lot ,
but it really is our best option .
could we ask dr. altman what she thinks ?
uh , dr. altman is a cardiothoracic surgeon .
this isn &apos;t her area of expertise .
i know , but she did this amazing thing for me .
i trust her .
i &apos;d feel a whole lot better if i knew that she was on board .
i &apos;ve got a consult waiting .
we &apos;ll be quick . karev .
we put together some stats
comparing the surgical options for sarah .
骨移植替代方案
as you can see , this slide shows the donor site morbidities
associated with using sarah &apos;s own skull . next slide .
and here you can see the pros and cons of using skull bone versus cadaver bone .
you can see that the benefits of using cadaver bone
are really quite extensive--
turn the lights on .
we just got started .
lights . now .
mark , i know what the research says .
so there &apos;s a chance of some donor graft complications .
complications ? no .
you , come here .
we do your procedure ,
we &apos;d incise here and here .
what &apos;s happening ?
stand still .
there &apos;s risk of hitting brain , causing a hematoma .
or we take the cadaver route . you avoid that completely ,
which means all of this ...
doesn &apos;t even get touched .
she &apos;s a child . and that-- that procedure is experimental .
so as the lead doctor on this case , let me be clear ,
we &apos;re doing the surgery as planned .
you &apos;re a crappy listener .
add that to the list .
what ?
just saying , there &apos;s more wrong with you than the fact that you smoke .
i probably shouldn &apos;t have used permanent marker .
my apologies .
mrs. burton .
mrs henry burton .
your husband requested that i talk to you
about his upcoming operation .
we would like to remove the kidney .
well , a man can live without a kidney ...
if that &apos;s your recommendation .
funny , because that &apos;s exactly what i would recommend ,
but apparently , my recommendation as chief of surgery ,
with over 30 years of general surgery experience under my belt ,
isn &apos;t enough .
he would like your recommendation .
the recommendation of a cardio surgeon
who happens to be his wife .
i see .
yeah , i agree with your recommendation .
there you go .
this is a totally inappropriate relationship .
totally inappropriate .
you want to talk to me about inappropriate relationships ?
everywhere i look in this hospital ,
there is inappropriate relationships--
grey and shepherd , hunt and yang ,
the other grey and sloan .
dr. bailey &apos;s dating a nurse , taking full advantage .
oh ! i--ignore him .
we are not dating .
no plus sign yet ?
no , and i &apos;m so tired of peeing on sticks .
it &apos;s exhausting .
okay , you think peeing is exhausting ?
wait till you have a mewling , pooh @-@ covered infant
hanging off of your boobs 24 / 7 .
why is my baby gonna be pooh @-@ covered ?
okay , what is that about ?
that &apos;s right .
do another loop there . beautiful .
you &apos;re a fast learner .
i have a good teacher .
come on . you blame him ? she &apos;s hot .
don &apos;t be a pig .
he &apos;s being gross , not to mention unprofessional .
well , the thong is unprofessional .
damn it .
unprofessional . wh @-@ what is wrong with them ?
i was never that dumb when i was in med school .
they &apos;re weak and gutless .
boy crazy .
oblivious .
slutty .
you all sound really old .
okay , i know i &apos;m not perfect .
and i know sometimes i don &apos;t listen ,
and i &apos;m sorry about that .
so here i am , ready to listen .
ready to listen ?
like a priest at confession .
you want to hear what i &apos;m saying and really take it in
and try to give me what i want ?
yeah . i really-- i really do .
get your crap out of my apartment .
all right , let &apos;s bandage him up and get him ready for the next phase .
kira , do you want to take a look at these sutures before ...
kira .
sorry ?
are you texting ?
oh , i was just telling my boyfriend about this .
can i send him a picture , do you think ?
no .
all right , everybody , take your places .
can i help roll him over ?
edward , move .
okay , we &apos;re gonna roll him on my count . everybody ready ?
one , two , three .
he &apos;s got a junctional rhythm .
a pulse with that ?
all right , his pulse is thready , but it &apos;s there .
he &apos;s hypotensive . grey , hang some f.f.p.
let &apos;s push 1 of epi .
lost his pulse . starting compressions .
he could have some delayed internal bleeding .
let &apos;s get ready for a laparotomy .
i need to get in there . gown me .
what about hyperkalemia ?
all right , out . now .
i saw the monitors when you turned him .
he had p.t. waves , then a widened q.r.s. ,
then a sine @-@ wave rhythm .
dude .
okay , push 2 of calcium , 2 of d @-@ 50,
and ten units of regular insulin i.v.
uh , they just taught us that on friday , so ...
what &apos;s your name ?
edward , sir .
good save , edward .
okay , tell me about your cadaver bone thing .
for sarah .
really ? look at you .
did somebody maybe listen to
what someone else had to say ?
okay , i get it .
i suck . i &apos;m a stuck @-@ up , self @-@ righteous bitch ,
and callie wants nothing to do with me ever again ,
but can you just drop it
and tell me about the damn surgery ?
we &apos;ll inject the donor bones with stem cells .
this way , the bones will grow and conform to sarah &apos;s face .
there &apos;s a much lower chance they &apos;ll degrade over time ,
which is key , especially if you want to play sports .
cool . random dead guy &apos;s bones in my cheeks .
my teammates will call me &quot; zombie face . &quot;
but it &apos;s still highly experimental .
jared .
yeah , what about the original plan ?
this surgery is more advanced ,
and would decrease the chance of complications
that could make the kind of sports that sarah wants to play
out of the question .
well , it &apos;s just sports , honey .
you &apos;re good at other things . you paint . you draw .
because that &apos;s all i &apos;ve been allowed to do .
i &apos;m a tomboy , but i &apos;ve never been able to be a tomboy .
i know you want me to ...
draw and paint and bowl ,
but ... i want to play volleyball
and softball and soccer .
i don &apos;t know .
if you guys don &apos;t let me take this chance
to be who i really am ,
i &apos;m gonna be more prone to teen depression ,
eating disorders , drug addiction .
is that what you want ?
you are too smart for your own good .
because all i do is read .
let me be a dumb jock .
mom ...
dad ...
please .
dividing and ligating the renal artery and vein .
beautiful . nice work , dr. yang .
mr. wilson , would you like
to take a look at the tumor up close ?
oh . sure . i @-@ i mean , yes .
okay , so these are the hilar vessels .
our med student &apos;s gonna faint .
catch him , people .
thank you .
sorry about that , sir .
ah , it &apos;s fine .
that &apos;s exactly why i like seeing first @-@ year med students
here once a year .
reminds me where i started .
humility--
that &apos;s another good quality for a chief resident ,
wouldn &apos;t you say , dr. bailey ?
it was always one of my best qualities .
also , it &apos;s funny when they fall down .
sir , you want to take a look at this .
he &apos;s doing fine . his spine &apos;s been stabilized ,
and , uh , he &apos;ll be awake soon .
he &apos;s fine ? he &apos;ll be okay ?
his recovery will be slow and painful .
you should be prepared for that .
this was supposed to be the best day of our lives .
you think i &apos;m silly , i know ...
with the horses and the ... bagpipes .
so does he .
we don &apos;t get marriage in washington .
we get domestic partnerships .
we get to go to city hall
and stand in line
and ... sign some papers .
mail it in if you &apos;re even more romantic .
so call me crazy , but ...
i @-@ i just wanted the big day that everybody else gets .
and i fought for it .
i organized rallies , i ...
stood in the cold outside the statehouse .
i had some neanderthal throw hot coffee on me .
i fought for a wedding
and waited .
and they still said no .
so when we got tired of waiting , and ...
brady and i went to go sign the papers ,
i wanted it to be special .
he &apos;s the best thing that &apos;s ever happened to me ,
and i wanted it to feel like that .
not like some trip to the dmv .
i wanted it to be special .
and instead , i nearly killed him .
things don &apos;t go the way you want &apos; em to .
ever .
ever .
come on .
let &apos;s go see him .
you paged me , chief ?
we found a cyst on henry &apos;s pancreas
that &apos;s in danger of rupturing .
removing it means removing a large portion of his pancreas ,
which would make henry a diabetic .
we didn &apos;t discuss that possibility with him .
okay .
well , do you think that &apos;s something he could live with ?
i don &apos;t know .
well , i hate to ask you on the spot , dr. altman ,
but technically , you are the wife .
and you &apos;re also his emergency contact person ,
so i am asking you ,
do you think he has the support system
to manage a very tricky disease ?
i don &apos;t know .
is there someone we could call ? a next of kin ? anyone ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t know .
you signed a marriage license ,
and you haven &apos;t asked him the most basic questions
on how he wants to live or die ?
do i have your permission to act as i see fit ?
yes .
that &apos;s all , dr. altman .
so ... did you get my note ?
eli .
i guess you got my note .
what do you think ?
i think you &apos;re dirty is what i think .
you want to be dirty with me ? show me those on @-@ call rooms
you doctors are always having sex in ?
i &apos;m going home .
if you change your mind ...
i get off in an hour .
i have a phd .
um ... after college , i got a phd ,
and then i went to medical school ,
and i &apos;m number one in my class .
i know you think i &apos;m an idiot , but i &apos;m not .
i @-@ i &apos;ve seen this stuff in textbooks .
i @-@ i &apos;ve just n @-@ never seen it up close before .
whatever .
think what you want of me .
you want to not be an idiot ?
back up your resident , no matter what .
never undercut them in front of their boss .
and when a patient asks you for information ,
you &apos;re not allowed to give them .
stall or say you don &apos;t know .
just wait long enough until the attending gets there .
the attending takes the lead .
and if you ever panic or feel faint in an o.r. again ,
just ... stop thinking
there &apos;s a body open the table in front of you .
just stop thinking and take a deep breath .
it usually helps .
now i feel like an ass .
just disregard my evaluation .
what evaluation ?
we turned in evaluations on you guys .
what did you say ?
um ... i might have used the word , uh , &quot; heartless . &quot;
among others , there were ...
check the monitor .
thank you , doctor .
okay . lay it on me .
lay what on you ?
the speech .
you know , &quot; the chief is right and what you did
was totally inappropriate &quot; speech .
oh , uh , the speech . yeah .
okay , i not dating a nurse .
we are not dating .
but we are having ... fun .
i mean , i @-@ i look at him ,
and he &apos;s ...
pretty .
but there &apos;s no future .
he &apos;s just--i mean , i @-@ i would not have him to my house
or introduce him to my child .
because who knows what he would do .
he left a dirty note for me in a chart .
now what if-- what if the chief
opened the chart and--and found the ...
it &apos;s inappropriate . that &apos;s what--that &apos;s what he is .
he is inappropriate .
but i &apos;m @-@ a go with it .
because , you know ... why not ?
that &apos;s my attitude these days .
why the hell not ?
a cadaver bone doesn &apos;t have
any bone growing cells or proteins in it ,
which is why we &apos;re drilling holes in it .
would you like to hold it ?
what do you think you &apos;re doing ?
teaching .
dr. karev , do you really think it &apos;s appropriate
for someone with so little experience
to be handling these cadaver bones ? relax .
karev , kepner &apos;s right .
your student &apos;s allowed to observe . that &apos;s all .
stubborn , passive @-@ aggressive ,
uh , i resent obligations .
just tell me when i &apos;m getting warm here .
i choose her over you in the divorce .
you know that , right ?
of course , of course .
that &apos;s because you two have been friends forever ,
and you and i are like siblings .
we fight . we get on each other &apos;s nerves .
but the point is , you &apos;re like family to me , mark .
i mean that .
patronizing . add that to the list .
periosteal elevator , please .
thank you .
here . have some water .
good .
just tell me .
there was a large cyst on your pancreas .
when they got in there ,
it was necrotic and close to rupturing .
they called me to make a decision
because you listed me
as your emergency contact person .
and what did you decide ?
they removed a large portion of your pancreas ,
which means that you might be
an insulin @-@ dependant diabetic for the rest of your life .
it &apos;s gonna be a very big adjustment for you .
i &apos;m a man who has a green thumb for tumors .
i &apos;m familiar with adjustments .
i really am-- i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry .
you &apos;re also angry ...
that i put you ...
as my emergency contact .
this was supposed to be about paperwork .
life @-@ and @-@ death decisions wasn &apos;t--
it j--it wasn &apos;t part of our deal .
i &apos;m 42 years old .
i lost my ...
mom and dad four and ...
five years ago , respectively .
my sister lives in prague ,
which is a @-@ a longer story than you want to hear .
and when i talk to her , i tend to err on the side of ,
&quot; how are the kids ? &quot; and &quot; everything here &apos;s great , &quot;
because ... she &apos;s broke ,
and because my health thing is ...
it &apos;s exhausting .
i used to have a best friend ,
but he married a woman who made sure that i knew
that my health thing was exhausting .
and because i kept maxing out my insurance policies ,
i had to switch jobs about nine times in the past five years ,
so i &apos;ve always just been the new guy
in the cubicle by the bathroom who takes a lot of ...
takes a lot of sick days .
that &apos;s not a guy people make friends with .
it &apos;s not my intention to make you feel sorry for me .
it &apos;s my intention to apologize and ...
and to explain ...
that in this city ...
you &apos;re the closest thing i have to a friend .
that &apos;s why i put you down as my emergency contact .
not because of the fake marriage , but ...
but because i consider you a friend .
* after begging to be left alone *
* if you want you can make me your home *
* sing me *
i might be a diabetic ?
yeah .
that sucks .
yeah .
* love you *
* the best i can *
hey how are you feeling ?
brady ...
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i just wanted it to be special .
special .
i know .
you always do .
shut up .
i have to say this before i fall asleep again .
brady , shh . please .
i forgive you .
do you hear that ?
i forgive you .
so ... stop apologizing .
and please ...
do not ... try to make it up to me ,
&apos;cause you &apos;ll kill me for sure .
i love you .
he &apos;s up , if you want to do a post @-@ op assessment .
okay , thanks . good night .
how long does the post @-@ op assessment take ?
oh , kira .
why don &apos;t you just go home ?
no , it &apos;s cool .
you &apos;re obviously not interested in learning anything .
i am . i totally am . today was really interesting .
really ? because you had the chance to observe
a very rare surgery today ,
and you looked at your phone the whole , entire time .
you had the opportunity to ask me any question you wanted ,
and instead , you asked me about my husband .
you &apos;ve been sneaking off to the bathroom all day ,
and i saw the pregnancy tests in your locker .
so me asking about your husband ?
i was just trying to get on your good side .
whatever .
oh , you &apos;re kidding . they were evaluating us ?
don &apos;t worry . no one will read them .
they &apos;ll just filed away in a room next to the morgue .
&quot; dr. yang ...
lacked patience and basic compassion . &quot;
dr. kepner ...
&quot; unwilling to delegate . &quot;
&quot; dr. avery placed his own learning opportunities
before my own . &quot;
i ...
and dr. grey ...
&quot; seemed to have a lot going on personally today . &quot;
the only one of you who seemed to actually teach today
was dr. karev .
the rest of you failed ...
big @-@ time .
i hate that guy .
i don &apos;t know . okay ?
i don &apos;t-- i don &apos;t know what my worst faults are .
i mean , i try not to think about them .
i &apos;m not proud of that . so just tell me ...
what the hell do i have to cop to
to--to make her give me another chance ?
you bail .
when things get hard ,
you bail .
* for the feeling that i lost today *
* summer sent a runner for the feeling ... *
&quot; unwilling to delegate &quot; ?
i am a great delegator .
it &apos;s the key to why i &apos;m so organized .
oh , hi . uh ... just wanted to get some water .
well , the glasses are in that cabinet .
* summer sent a runner *
* for the feeling that i lost today *
* you must be somewhere *
* you must be loving your life in the rain . *
* you must be somewhere in london *
* walking abbey lane famous angels *
so how &apos;d you do today ?
mm . med student screwed me .
but i did pretty good .
mm . want some dinner ?
mm @-@ hmm .
* i don &apos;t even think to make *
* i don &apos;t even think to make corrections *
so i peed on ten sticks today .
ten ?
and i stole them from the clinic
because they &apos;re $ 15 at the store .
so you &apos;re a thief . is that what you &apos;re telling me ?
a barren thief .
look ...
it takes time , getting pregnant .
not for some people . some people hit it on the first try .
well , those people are overachievers .
i am an overachiever . that &apos;s the whole thing .
i spent my whole day peeing on sticks
and not teaching my med student ,
so i &apos;m getting my ass kicked in this race for chief resident .
so i &apos;m not overachieving at anything .
i used to be hard @-@ core .
now i &apos;m soft @-@ core .
what ... did we just start talking about porn ?
stop it . i &apos;m upset .
you &apos;re just upset because we haven &apos;t made a baby .
and i say , practice makes perfect .
i bail . okay ?
when things get hard , i @-@ i walk away ,
and maybe it &apos;s because i grew up an army brat .
we moved every 18 months .
maybe i never learned to commit .
but i &apos;m here now , and i &apos;m staying ,
because i &apos;m gonna fight to make sure
that you know that i &apos;m committed to this thing .
now i @-@ i &apos;m not perfect , but neither are you .
and you @-@ you want to talk about faults ?
how about not being able to forgive ?
at some point , you &apos;re gonna have to forgive me .
and it may as well be now ,
because i am in love with you , calliope ,
and you are in love with me .
and all i &apos;m asking for is one more chance .
it &apos;s all anybody wants , right ,
clean slate ... a new beginning ?
you want another chance ?
yes . more than anything , i want another chance .
like that &apos;s gonna be any easier .
ask the guy pushing the boulder up the hill .
nothing &apos;s easy about starting over .
today i found out that i &apos;m pregnant
with mark &apos;s baby .
how about now ?
nothing at all .
