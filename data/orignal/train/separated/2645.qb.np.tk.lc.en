how long do i have ?
you have 30 minutes .
that &apos;s not enough time .
that &apos;s all you &apos;ve got to document it and clean it .
dad !
they got her .
and we are just now getting reports
that former fbi agent elizabeth keen has been shot and killed .
no comment yet from the fbi , but moments ago ,
this photo appeared on the washington chronicle website .
the paper , quoting anonymous sources ,
is saying keen was one of several victims
shot at an undisclosed location outside of new york city .
keen stands accused of committing
the worst acts of terrorism on american soil
in over a decade .
she &apos;s been a fugitive for the past five weeks ,
the subject of one of the largest manhunts
in fbi history .
the details are still coming in ,
and we are working to confirm them for you ,
but it appears , on day ...
are you sure this is a good idea ?
yes .
get the photos to sandquist at the chronicle .
i want everyone to know what happened here today .
so , hi .
my name is asher sutton . what &apos;s yours ?
and , please , don &apos;t tell me it &apos;s wainright ,
&apos;cause that is about as phony as that watch you &apos;re wearing .
your job was to get into his world ,
and within two minutes ,
he clocks you &apos;re not who you say you are ?
i wanted him to catch me .
why bother with him at all ?
you want to help liz , you need to find karakurt .
i can &apos;t do that until i get access
to the russians that karakurt is hiding out with .
asher sutton is gonna give me that .
why would he do that ?
everybody needs a rush .
for some , it &apos;s drugs or sex or whatever .
but a guy like asher sutton ,
he just wants to know how the other half lives .
no , seriously , who are you ?
raised by a single mom .
used to clean dorms at bronx college .
uh , i got a brother in prison .
i &apos;m nobody . i &apos;m a townie .
my great @-@ grandfather --
he was a hustler , con man , a townie .
the only person in my family worth a lick
was , like , exactly like you .
ah , so that &apos;s why you didn &apos;t bust me , huh ?
i tapped into his accounts .
sutton owes a lot of money .
he withdraws $ 20,000 in cash once a month .
who he &apos;s paying or why , i @-@ i don &apos;t know .
take a wild guess .
that sounds nice , all right ?
i appreciate the offer , really ,
but listen , i don &apos;t want to impose .
listen , for saving your ass ,
i think i deserve one person at my engagement party
who i actually want to talk to .
all right .
my name is matt buckley .
pleasure to meet you , matt buckley .
cheers .
cheers .
did you know a presidential commission
was looking into the attacks ?
it &apos;s time for us to move .
if they do their job , if they look for the truth ,
this could all end .
lizzy , we have to move now .
the cabal -- they found us .
worse .
what could be worse than that ?
not what , who . wendigo .
wendigo ? who &apos;s that ?
the myth of a nameless assassin .
and he &apos;s coming for you .
this wendigo , if he doesn &apos;t work for the cabal ,
who does he work for ?
no one . he &apos;s not for hire .
wendigo is the embodiment of vigilante justice .
he identifies , hunts , and kills targets .
he deems unfit for society .
some believe he &apos;s ex @-@ special ops
because his presence is felt but never seen .
whatever his history ,
apparently , you &apos;ve caught his attention .
this vigilante believes i deserve to die ?
罪行 通缉恐怖份子 涉嫌俄欧分析处爆炸事件及杀害司法部长康纳利和美国议员霍金斯
a transport team is en route .
i &apos;ll call you when they arrive .
call me ? where are you going ?
to get help .
... the courage to change the things i can ,
and the wisdom to know the difference .
amen . amen .
fold your hands in front of you .
walk .
an assassin has targeted agent keen .
if we haven &apos;t found her , he won &apos;t .
he &apos;s better than you . he &apos;s better than me .
that &apos;s why i need your help to protect her .
i thought that &apos;s what your job was .
well , i failed at that .
turn around .
i &apos;m a little rusty in the 12 steps ,
but if i &apos;m not mistaken , step 9 is making amends .
i can &apos;t do that without you .
i suggest you start with step 4 and make a searching
and fearless moral inventory of yourself .
i admire the way you &apos;re dealing with your addiction , donald .
i tried n.a. once after an opium den
in kuala lumpur got the best of me .
didn &apos;t stick .
i couldn &apos;t get past the requirement
to believe in a power greater than myself .
officer down .
i repeat , officer down . 546 hawthorne place .
send all units .
you got four minutes .
what i know about this assassin will take less than two .
several of wendigo &apos;s killings
are cold cases on the bureau &apos;s radar .
el malo grande headed the mejia cartel out of guatemala .
he was killed while living under an alias in madrid .
jose perez , exiled angolan dictator ,
was murdered while hiding out in brasilia .
maybe they &apos;re cold because no one mourns their loss .
they &apos;re despicable thugs .
any known aliases ?
no .
the only hit on our forensics database is this .
both kills were made using a homemade projectile
fired from some kind of improvised firearm .
handcrafted weapons , homemade bullets used in homicides .
the list can &apos;t be that long .
have it compiled by the time i get back
from getting my ass kicked at the presidential commission .
thank you for letting us protect agent keen .
we &apos;re not going after wendigo to protect keen .
we &apos;re going after him to find her .
those despicable thugs -- they were wanted fugitives .
everyone was looking for them . wendigo found them .
if he can do that , he can find keen .
when he does , i &apos;m gonna be there to arrest her .
lizzy , my transport team is on @-@ site .
you need to leave with them now .
did ressler agree to help ?
my people will take you to the jet .
from there , you &apos;ll fly to quito .
oh ! gun !
get into the car .
lizzy ?
where is he ? ! we go on my ready .
1 ... 2 ...
no ! get down !
talk to me . lizzy ?
aram , what happened ?
mr. reddington ?
the shooting -- what do you know ?
agent navabi is en route .
nypd is confirming two fatalities .
agent keen ?
no . oh , uh , god , no .
agent keen stole a car ,
abandoned it 10 blocks from the scene .
where are you on wendigo ?
uh , that , you know , i &apos;m not really supposed to talk about .
you have five seconds . 4 ... 3 ...
according to mexican authorities ,
the gun he used in one of the cold cases
was made by a master gunsmith
named zachary o &apos;toole , a.k.a. zed .
uh , we haven &apos;t been able to locate him .
please tell me you didn &apos;t get to zero .
hello ?
well , the president doesn &apos;t need a commission
to find out where the failure of intelligence happened .
i agree , but the commission has a job to do .
so this all just cover your ass ?
i doubt hitchin agrees with you .
answer her questions directly ,
and keep your opinions to yourself .
reven .
hand to god , how amazing was saturday ?
i know i &apos;m his mom ,
but philip &apos;s bar mitzvah -- cutest thing ever .
it was incredible .
although my idiot husband did order 500 extra swag bags ,
so one for you , one for you .
uh , donald ressler ,
the president &apos;s national security adviser .
laurel hitchin .
reven speaks very highly of you .
i look forward to your testimony .
that makes one of us .
uh , truth be told , i &apos;m a little , uh , nervous .
don &apos;t be . we &apos;re not looking for a scapegoat .
just the truth .
can i give you a bit of advice ?
please .
the mint @-@ chocolate candies are a little stale ,
but the red velvet cake pops -- to die for .
agent ressler , are you withholding material evidence
that could lead to the capture of elizabeth keen ?
absolutely not , no .
then you are sharing information with the c.i.a.
唐纳德 · 雷斯勒
not at this time .
are you aware of the fact that after 9 / 11,
唐纳德 · 雷斯勒
the u.s. intelligence system was overhauled
to make sure that information was shared .
i &apos;m not sharing information with the c.i.a.
because mr. kotsiopolus has been accused
of heading the organization
that may be responsible for these attacks .
accusations which have yet to be substantiated .
until they are , he deserves the benefit of the doubt .
as does elizabeth keen .
do you have evidence that the cabal exists ?
names of cabal members have been published --
i know about the fulcrum . i &apos;ve seen the list .
it &apos;s 25 years old .
names on that list are in positions of power .
susan hanover from verdiant --
the hanover arrest came out of your pursuit of elizabeth keen .
doesn &apos;t that suggest the link is to her ?
no , no . i believe that ms. keen
was there in an effort to clear her name .
she was your partner ?
correct , yes .
do you believe she &apos;s innocent ?
my job isn &apos;t to determine her guilt or innocence .
you didn &apos;t answer my question .
my job is to apprehend ms. keen ,
and i have no problem doing that .
i am not asking about your job .
i &apos;m asking what you believe .
elizabeth keen is not a terrorist .
so you believe she &apos;s innocent ?
yes , i do .
i believe that if she is given a fair trial
by a jury of her peers ,
there aren &apos;t 12 people in america
who wouldn &apos;t agree with me .
thank you .
navabi .
i &apos;ve been thinking about the shooter .
where are you ?
he had a clear line of sight
and a secure location .
on the other side of mcdougal ,
there is a hotel , the palace
or park something -- it had to be from there .
contact hotel security . they &apos;ll have footage .
you might get an image .
if you &apos;re lucky , a print .
over here .
samar ?
this guy &apos;s good , liz .
nice catch .
what did you find ?
he found you once .
he &apos;ll find you again .
and this time , he may not miss .
samar , what did you find ?
liz , you know i &apos;m here , so you must be close .
turn yourself in .
take responsibility for what you &apos;ve done .
i would . i do .
but not for the things i haven &apos;t .
psalm 1 : 1 . what &apos;s that ?
&quot; blessed is he who walks not in the council of the wicked . &quot;
the bullet was so close , i could hear it . i thought ...
i have good news .
dembe made contact .
you spoke to him ?
no . we have a protocol . he initiated it .
i &apos;ll meet him later today .
in the meantime , aram gave me a name --
a gunsmith who makes wendigo &apos;s weapons .
feds don &apos;t know how to find him .
but i do .
what the -- w @-@ what is this ?
hands .
sit .
wendigo , the assassin ...
who the hell are you ?
tell me how to find him .
how do i find wendigo ?
i don &apos;t --
i have no idea .
would you look at that ?
.416 rigby mauser .
and fully loaded , no less .
an african bull elephant weighs 14,000 pounds ,
and this can bring one down .
i happened upon one of those magnificent creatures
in the zambezi valley ,
and one of these came in quite handy .
you shot an elephant ?
lord , no .
i shot the poacher that was about to kill the elephant .
i know a place that he stayed at before .
i @-@ i &apos;m not sure if that &apos;s where he is now ,
but i can give you an address .
of course you can .
♬ i wouldn &apos;t want to dance without you ♬
♬ without you , i would rather be alone ♬
♬ and unless my arms ... ♬
take the stairs !
no !
grab my arm .
i &apos;m not the only one .
there are more , and they &apos;re coming .
who &apos;s coming ?
you can &apos;t stop them .
who ?
nypd is still trying to confirm the victim was wendigo ,
but traffic cameras in the area confirm
that mr. reddington and agent keen were in the vicinity .
also , agents on scene forwarded a hard drive
they found in the unsub &apos;s apartment .
check this out .
what am i looking at ?
an advertisement for a hit man .
someone was going to pay wendigo $ 700,000 to kill liz .
who ?
not just wendigo .
they &apos;ll be others .
that &apos;s the scary part . this isn &apos;t a contract .
it &apos;s a bounty on the dark net .
&quot; wanted -- dead not alive . &quot;
deadnotalive.org ?
that &apos;s what it &apos;s actually called ?
someone with the screen name
&quot; arioch cain &quot; put a price on her head .
now any nutjob who kills agent keen
will collect the money if he can prove he did it .
how does he do that ?
by submitting the date , location ,
and method of execution ,
plus a unique identifier .
wendigo &apos;s was psalm 1 : 1 .
can you take down the site ?
it is decentralized , cached on servers all over the world .
i take one down , two pop up .
it is completely anonymous ,
so there &apos;s no way to tell who this arioch cain really is .
when nypd forwarded me the hard drive ,
they told me they believe there &apos;s a laptop that &apos;s missing .
reddington .
if he took it , could he trace who put up the money ?
no . see , the person who put her on the site
didn &apos;t put up the money .
then who did ? - haters --
people who believe what they read about agent keen .
they make bitcoin donations --
the miracle of crowdsourcing
turned on its head to crowd @-@ fund murder .
the more notorious the target , the bigger the fund ,
and the more people who will try it .
we thought wendigo was bad . this is way worse .
there &apos;s no limit to how many assassins could be coming after her .
dembe &apos;s here .
where &apos;s dembe ?
what happened ?
you must be asher &apos;s newest bff .
i &apos;m gwen , his other significant other .
oh , yeah . does he have a lot ?
oh , yes . asher &apos;s quite the collector .
he &apos;s the chocolate inside the m &amp; m.
you &apos;re the hard shell .
melts in your mouth , does he ?
or my hand .
i &apos;m good either way .
lucky man .
tell me , mister , um ...
buckley -- matt buckley .
tell me , mr. buckley .
do you believe in love at first sight ?
i don &apos;t know .
i think love is , uh , more of an acquired taste .
have you ever acquired it -- love ?
yeah . once .
you say that like it &apos;s a bad thing .
love isn &apos;t like an orgasm , mr. buckley .
once is quite enough .
yeah , it should have been .
maybe it will be . who knows , right ?
i &apos;ve loved asher sutton
since the moment i laid eyes on him .
i love everything about him ,
including his peculiar affinity for collectibles ,
even at my engagement party .
on one condition --
that they look me in the eye and promise me
that they will never , ever do anything to harm the man that i love .
i promise .
well , then ...
well , what are you waiting for ?
i need a refill .
you got it .
maybe i wasn &apos;t clear how this works , huh ?
i told you i &apos;ll have it to you by friday .
and i told you i &apos;m not here to negotiate .
it &apos;s due today .
excuse me .
is there a problem ?
no , no . i @-@ it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s fine .
you sure ?
yeah , it &apos;s okay .
he said it &apos;s okay , huh ?
i heard him .
maybe you should go .
we &apos;re not through here , huh ?
looks like i made a new friend .
i really wish you hadn &apos;t done that .
i stayed with him until he was gone .
i didn &apos;t want to leave him behind .
but they were coming ,
and if i had tried to bring him back with me ,
we would have both been killed .
we will avenge this good man &apos;s death ,
i promise you .
we can &apos;t stay here .
oh , my god .
this emblem -- i &apos;ve seen it before .
伊丽莎白 · 基恩
you were on the website .
no . t @-@ t @-@ that was just --
we know what it is and why you have it .
you want the bounty for yourself .
that &apos;s why you gave us wendigo to knock out the competition .
who put her on the site ?
i d @-@ don &apos;t know .
oh , my god !
who put her on the site ?
i @-@ i only know the screen name of the site creator --
g @-@ gavrilo princip .
thank you for your time .
you can &apos;t just bust into my place , bring me here --
you saw the warrant , princip .
this is the site creator ?
you &apos;re gavrilo princip ?
real name gavin delgado .
you can &apos;t take my -- those computers are intellectual property !
elizabeth isn &apos;t safe here .
better call edward , tell him to get the jet ready .
edward , mr. vargas .
i &apos;m with reddington and keen .
edward ? i always liked the name edward .
i &apos;ve been instructed to inform you
to meet us at the garden avenue airfield right away .
get the car .
has the cia shared intel
regarding the acts of terror with the fbi ?
yes .
in your opinion ,
why hasn &apos;t the bureau reciprocated ?
because the person responsible
is fbi special agent elizabeth keen .
so you don &apos;t share agent ressler &apos;s opinion
that she &apos;s innocent ?
elizabeth keen is a russian sleeper agent .
she said as much to agent ressler
when she scaled the wall of the russian embassy ,
admitted that her real name is masha rostova ,
and asked for asylum .
and the fulcrum ?
the fulcrum is an irrelevant relic ,
which , in case you haven &apos;t read
cathcart &apos;s piece in the post ,
is being systematically debunked as we speak .
he likens it to the protocols of the elders of zion ,
which has taken a few anomalous grains of truth
and spun a mountain of lies ,
concocted by conspiracy theorists .
forgive me , but i don &apos;t draw my evidence from the popular press .
facts , then .
the fulcrum was released by raymond reddington ,
a man without morals , without conscience ,
and certainly without any credibility .
and the existence of a cabal ?
state @-@ sanctioned acts of terror by russia .
threat level red .
where &apos;s edward ?
specter of another cold war .
in times of chaos ,
i can understand the public &apos;s need for a simple solution .
ergo a cabal .
what have you done ?
so you deny running any such organization ?
a shadow government that controls world events ?
i &apos;m flattered , but , uh , yes ,
i deny running any such organizations .
i can assure you there is no cabal .
mr. reddington ...
i think you know the outcome of this .
even if you shoot me and perhaps one of my associates ,
even if your girlfriend gets off a shot or two ...
... you &apos;re both gonna die .
put down your gun , elizabeth .
put down the gun .
you created the site .
you can take agent keen off the site .
no , i can &apos;t .
i don &apos;t believe you .
you don &apos;t believe me ?
go try a layer four udp / tcp
in the osi stacks .
agent navabi ?
i don &apos;t understand half of what he &apos;s saying .
i don &apos;t even know what questions to ask him .
i thought you were great .
maybe i can talk to him .
look , gavin --
mr. delgado , we both know you can take that site down .
i don &apos;t choose who deserves to die .
the masses do .
no capitol hill , no committees , no debates .
i &apos;ve created the purest form of democracy .
by dispersing power directly into the hands of the people ,
no single person possesses the ability to tip the scales .
and i don &apos;t choose targets .
the people do .
if you don &apos;t take agent keen off your site --
you &apos;ll what ?
hit me with a denial of service attack ?
actually , i was thinking more like
millions of repetitive requests .
my mitigation capacity will frag any traffic you throw at .
i know your dark web p2p is cached on multiple servers ,
but i &apos;ve got a virus concealed via rootkit .
look , i &apos;m way ahead of you .
there &apos;s a reason people trust me enough
to put millions in my site .
because they know you can &apos;t take the money and run .
which means it &apos;s a two @-@ key system .
you can &apos;t take agent keen &apos;s name down .
only the person who nominated her
to be assassinated can do that .
good talk .
what is the deal with you two anyways ?
it &apos;s what everybody wants to know .
some say it &apos;s a daddy / daughter thing .
others swear it &apos;s may @-@ september .
i prefer to believe ...
... it &apos;s a little of both .
the fact that we &apos;re still alive
means you need something from me .
whatever it is , let her go .
my resources are at your disposal .
it &apos;s a limited @-@ time offer , matias .
you need to act now .
oh , you &apos;ll give me what i need .
i &apos;m certain of that .
right there . that &apos;s good .
come here ! ?
let go ! stop !
get her up there !
grab her legs !
get your hands off me .
pin her down !
stay there !
you need to stay put .
call the director . tell him i &apos;ll give him
everything i &apos;ve been collecting , all the evidence against him .
call him !
you don &apos;t need to concern yourself
with the director anymore .
you &apos;re in my care now , reddington .
you don &apos;t understand .
they &apos;re gonna come after me , after us .
look , i know , but there has to be something you can do .
who ?
please , listen .
you &apos;ve done enough .
no . come on . why ?
you got yourself into something , right ?
tell me what . let me help you .
what do you know about underground boxing ?
human dog fighting .
people die . you don &apos;t want to bet on that .
no , no , no . i didn &apos;t bet on it .
i did it . i mean , i @-@ i fought .
let me guess . you lost .
no . i won .
that &apos;s the problem .
these guys -- they wanted me to throw a fight , but ...
people lost a lot of money --
the wrong kind of people .
he paid them back , but these people ,
they -- they found out about his family .
they &apos;re extorting him -- 20 grand a month .
they &apos;ll kill him if he doesn &apos;t pay .
that guy , the one you scared off , he &apos;s low @-@ level .
but the guys he works for are , uh , russians .
you know , they &apos;re organized .
russians ?
i hired a private detective
to see if i could cut a deal .
they found pieces of him along the allegheny .
it &apos;s never gonna end .
yeah , it is , because i &apos;m gonna fix it .
no .
i owe you this . - i can &apos;t let you --
hey , let him talk .
okay .
what would you do , matt ?
to do what i do well , i need my enemies to fear me .
every life that i take sends a message .
what happens next ...
... will be international news .
i &apos;m gonna execute a terrorist and a crime lord .
style points count .
solomon !
one ...
solomon !
... must work slowly ,
with great attention to detail ,
peeling flesh from bone
like a butcher filleting a salmon .
are you okay ?
yeah . - lizzy , where &apos;d he go -- solomon ?
he got away .
dembe .
i &apos;ve secured a safe site less than a mile away --
5243 north park .
call me as soon as you arrive .
dembe ?
dembe ?
we &apos;re gonna get you well .
ok , help that .
come on .
we &apos;re going with him .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m going with dembe .
you &apos;re not safe here .
aram , tell me she &apos;s off the site .
i thought i could .
i thought , uh -- - we gave you the name of the man
who created the site two hours ago .
have you found him ?
yes , but it is a two @-@ key system . he is only one of the keys .
the other key is this arioch cain ,
the person who put her on the site ,
and i can &apos;t find him unless i can follow the money ,
and there is no money to follow
until the bounty is put in escrow .
mr. reddington , i am so sorry ,
but the only way they &apos;re taking agent keen &apos;s name off the site
is if she &apos;s dead .
well , we &apos;re just gonna have to kill her .
uh , i &apos;m sorry . bad connection .
did you just say we &apos;ll have to kill her ?
aram , listen to me very carefully .
this is what i need you to do .
today is your lucky day . you &apos;re going to cop a plea .
all you have to do is enter your passkey
and confirm that wendigo killed agent keen .
date of death , cause of death ,
and unique identifier -- psalm 1 : 1 .
when you do , arioch cain will enter his passkey
to release the bounty .
no one is releasing anything
without independent verification that she &apos;s dead .
we have someone working on that .

okay , tell me what you see .
uh , the website says &quot; kill confirmed . &quot;
perfect . okay , delgado &apos;s admin site
should automatically release the funds into escrow .
when they do , wendigo should get an e @-@ mail with a link
to a routing number .
now , the actual funds won &apos;t be available for 32 hours ,
but the routing number can be back @-@ traced
to give us an address .
hang on . here we go . i got an e @-@ mail .
read me the routing number .
thank you , aram . that will be all .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;d prefer to know who put you on that site before the fbi .
i can &apos;t get a physical address
from the routing number without aram &apos;s help .
borakove , wake and bake and grab a pen .
i have a routing number i need you to track .
arioch cain ?
you ?
you look like you &apos;ve seen a ghost .
you &apos;re supposed to be dead .
i saw it on the news .
take me off the site .
site ?
what site ? what are you talking about ?
look at me and listen to what i &apos;m saying to you ,
because i &apos;m in no mood to repeat myself .
we know what you &apos;ve done .
we know you have the power to stop it .
no , he doesn &apos;t .
i &apos;m the one you &apos;re looking for .
i &apos;m the one who wants you dead .
on the couch .
you need to take me off that site .
no !
what site ? ! what the hell is going on ?
what are you people doing here ?
she ruined everything .
this isn &apos;t a game ! people are trying to kill me !
blair , what are they talking about ?
what you wanted .
how many times have you said that you wanted her dead ,
that you wanted the person who killed mom to die ?
the orea bombing .
you mother died in the orea bombing .
look at her .
her name was sharon .
did you know that before you blew her up ?
blair , honey ,
whatever they &apos;re telling you to do --
no ! dad , no .
i am so sorry , but i had nothing to do --
you killed her !
no , she didn &apos;t .
it &apos;s understandable that you would think she did ,
but she didn &apos;t .
you &apos;re wrong .
take it down , blair , before more innocent people die .
my mom was innocent .
i lost my mom when i was a little girl .
i know how you feel .
you don &apos;t .
i still think about her every day --
what we might talk about ...
what her voice might sound like .
i promise you ,
i had nothing to do with your mother &apos;s death .
i will do whatever it takes
to find the people responsible .
but i can &apos;t do anything until you take me off that site .
thank you .
blair ...
i &apos;m gonna get the people that killed your mother .
you made the right call .
not only is keen safe , but the site &apos;s down ,
and we have leads on four assassins we didn &apos;t know existed .
i thought you &apos;d be furious .
you know what i am ?
i &apos;m scared , because for a minute ,
i thought keen was gone .
i thought that , uh ...
agent ressler , when you have a moment .
we got to do a better job .
we got to go out there , and we got to find her
and bring her in , because every day she &apos;s out there
is the day we could lose her .
don &apos;t ever hug me like that again .
mrs. hitchin , i assume you &apos;re here to tell me
that the commission came to a sensible decision
about how to handle the director .
these red velvet cake pops are delicious .
the commission &apos;s work is ongoing ,
but laurel and i think it &apos;s prudent
for us all to be on the same page .
yeah , that &apos;s not gonna happen .
yeah , it is , and here &apos;s why .
we &apos;re not gonna repeat the intelligence failures of 9 / 11 .
the fbi and the c.i.a. must communicate ,
which means you two must work together .
from now on , you share intel-- anything and everything
relating to the whereabouts of reddington and keen .
i &apos;m fine with that .
agency &apos;s always been an open book on this topic .
i think you &apos;re making a big mistake here .
the president doesn &apos;t agree .
and if i &apos;m not willing to cooperate ?
then you &apos;ll be replaced by someone who is .
agent ressler ,
in the interests of national security ,
this is the best course of action .
seems you &apos;ve upgraded this place .
i &apos;d love to have a tour .
everyone has a way they want to be perceived--
a cover story , a lie .
they tell you what they want you to believe .
but i think actions speak louder than words ,
especially the ones we take out of loyalty
or our sense of duty
or love
or out of hope for a second chance .
that &apos;s all i want for you , liz-- a second chance .
i &apos;ll do anything to make sure that you get it .
i hope you &apos;re okay . if you get this , i &apos;ll be here .
hey , where have you been ?
working on my tan .
how did it go ? i tried calling you .
we had a very , uh , productive conversation .
oh , my god .
is that -- is that blood on your collar ?
what have you done ?
hey , look , i told you i would fix it , so i did .
open the trunk .
no , gwen ...
open the trunk !
you don &apos;t want me to do that .
do you have any idea who these people are ?
if you did something , if you --
t @-@ they &apos;re gonna think it was me , okay ?
they &apos;ll come for me .
no , they &apos;re not gonna come for you
without going through me first .
gw @-@ gwen !
oh god .
it &apos;s fine .
don &apos;t worry about it .
it &apos;s done .
