ian doyle vanished from prison .
interpol can &apos;t find him .
am i in danger ?
we all are .
prentiss , get down !
we &apos;re looking for a european team
with considerable training . for one of them , it &apos;s personal .
hey , what &apos;s that ?
bank accounts traceable to our first two victims .
we might be able to match the rest of those faces .
hello , lauren . oh , wait .
lauren reynolds died in a car accident , didn &apos;t she ?
come near my team and i will end you .
you took the only thing that mattered to me .
so i &apos;m gonna take the only thing that matters to you--
your life .
all the federal and international agents
responsible for tracking him down
are now on his list of targets .
lauren reynolds .
this is the guy i told you about .
he told me everything but a name .
ian doyle . pleasure .
i love being the man bringing people together .
have fun , kids .
jack told me you were provisional i.r.a.
used to be .
then the peace accord happened .
now i gotta look for work like everybody else .
except ... ian--
that &apos;s a protestant name , isn &apos;t it ?
not a lot of protestants in the i.r.a.
or is that how you proved you were a good fighter ,
defending your mother for giving you that name ?
and what is it you do , lauren ?
right now i &apos;m trying to get into business
with a former i.r.a. captain .
he &apos;s gone freelance . you might have heard of him .
valhalla .
yeah .
i might know him .
well ...
since this is sensitive ...
i said out !
get out of here , fahey .
do you know who i am ?
i am the man . i used to run this block .
now you &apos;re just a bum . out !
i got 4 names on the bottom of the list prentiss gave us .
luke renault ,
lawrence riley , lila rafferty ,
lyle rogers .
all with the initials l.r.
the cia uses cryptograms like that
to assign to non @-@ official cover agents
working the same case .
so do other foreign countries .
these last 4 names are covers--spies .
wait .
no . this isn &apos;t right .
do you see this space ? that shouldn &apos;t be here .
could it be a formatting error ?
no , this is a spreadsheet template .
formatting doesn &apos;t allow for this .
there &apos;s a missing name on here .
it &apos;s another spy whose cover is l.r.
lauren reynolds is dead .
lauren reynolds is dead .
lauren reynolds is dead .
what ?
&quot; lauren reynolds is dead . &quot;
prentiss said that on a phone call 17 days ago .
but her intonation wasn &apos;t surprise or grief .
it was like a mantra , like she was reminding herself .
lauren reynolds , l.r.
if prentiss is the last name on that list ,
she &apos;s on doyle &apos;s list , too .
that explains her behavior the past month .
the secrets , the evasion .
she &apos;s been biting her fingernails again , too .
guys .
she left her badge and gun ? why would she do that ?
that doesn &apos;t make sense . why run ?
we &apos;re her family . we can help .
doyle &apos;s killing families .
she &apos;s not married , not close to relatives .
he was ready to wipe us out .
she ran to protect us .
battery &apos;s dead , fahey .
jeez . lauren .
she &apos;s a trained spy . she doesn &apos;t want to be found .
she knows all of our tricks .
we don &apos;t know any of hers .
all right , then how do we find her ?
here &apos;s how . ian doyle is our unsub ,
prentiss is our victim .
we profile their behavior and we treat it like any other case .
because terrorism isn &apos;t an area we specialize in ,
i &apos;ve reached out to an expert from the state department ,
someone who can also shed light on prentiss &apos; past .
who ?
her .
let &apos;s get to work .
how many men does doyle have , jack ?
doyle ? i haven &apos;t seen that guy in a--
15 , maybe 20 guys .
any surprises ?
just automatic weapons . it &apos;s mostly local mob guys .
there &apos;s a little bit of i.r.a. and--
lauren , how about you do me a favor ,
huh , you ease up on that gun , ok ?
i helped you and clyde back in the day .
i can help you now .
do you want to know where doyle is ?
i already do .
yeah , but what are you gonna do , huh ,
take him out on your own ?
what are you gonna do , tell him ?
wait , wait , wait , wait , wait !
&quot; the secret to getting away with lying &quot;
&quot; is believing with all your heart . &quot;
&quot; that goes for lying to yourself &quot;
&quot; even more so than lying to another . &quot;
author elizabeth bear .
ok , so i talked to a friend from langley .
he couldn &apos;t give me emily &apos;s full cia history ,
but he could give me this .
she assumed the identity of lauren reynolds
as part of a special task force called jtf @-@ 12 .
i heard about them .
they were profiling terrorists , weren &apos;t they ?
yeah , assembled after 9 @-@ 11 .
cia and western agencies
contributed their best and brightest .
but serial killers and terrorists
have different personality traits .
how does doyle fit in ?
he was their last case .
and now the jtf is on his hit list .
jeremy wwolff was victim number one ,
from germany &apos;s bnd .
sean mcalister at interpol
was the second . he &apos;s the one
that brought the jtf in to work the doyle case .
he was murdered last week in brussels
with his wife and daughter .
tsia mosely of france &apos;s dcri .
she got engaged to jeremy earlier this year .
after he died , she fled to d.c.
and team leader clyde easter ,
british s.i.s.
he hasn &apos;t checked in since tsia &apos;s murder .
he was also in d.c.
did jtf make the arrests ?
no , the host countries handled that .
the team moved on to the next case .
if all they did was deliver a profile ,
how does doyle even know about them ?
well , considering the shadowy nature of terrorist cells ,
they utilize a skill we don &apos;t--infiltration .
who was undercover on doyle ?
emily . she made contact with him in boston
to get intel on valhalla .
she was posing as another weapons dealer .
look at how she &apos;s dressed .
she seems awfully comfortable .
how close did she get to doyle as part of her cover ?
the recon they did on doyle included
a background of all of his romantic relationships .
emily was his type .
she asked you to stop here yesterday ?
yeah .
change her boots and ...
get whatever she needed , i guess .
it &apos;s never easy , you know ,
having to dig through a friend &apos;s life .
but that &apos;s not what &apos;s bugging you , is it ?
you &apos;re angry
because she crossed the line with doyle .
no , i &apos;m not .
i &apos;m angry because a group of mercenaries
just shot at me .
i don &apos;t much like being shot at , rossi .
prentiss knew exactly what was going on ,
but she didn &apos;t bother to tell any of us .
she couldn &apos;t without putting us at risk .
come on , man , we don &apos;t know that .
all we do know is that she slept with a terrorist
for a profile .
and instead of coming clean with us about her dirty laundry ,
she just ran with it .
you think it &apos;s that simple ?
till there &apos;s a reason not to .
here &apos;s one .
that &apos;s her passport , the real one .
now , if you wanted to vanish ,
wouldn &apos;t you take that with you ?
this doesn &apos;t mean anything .
i worked with that woman for 5 years .
i put my life in her hands .
i called her my friend .
but right now i can &apos;t even say that i ever really knew her .
can you ?
there &apos;s something down there .
what do you got ?
it &apos;s called a gimmel ring .
the husband and wife @-@ to @-@ be wear individual bands
during the engagement and at the wedding .
you see the markings in the middle ? gaelic .
doyle gave it to her .
this ring is more than just a souvenir .
otherwise , why hang on to it all this time ?
why hide it from us ?
what makes you think she went to boston ?
well , the doyle case started in boston .
maybe she &apos;s going back to old locations trying to hunt him down .
if he had us in his crosshairs , she wouldn &apos;t run .
she &apos;d take the fight to him .
pack up this stuff . i want to be out of here in 48 hours .
open it .
liam , something bothering you ?
none of our other suppliers can get stuff this good .
she &apos;s too good to be true , and you &apos;re too blind to see it .
shut it .
get in the car ,
the second one .
i &apos;ll take care of her .
right .
you always ride in the second car . why ?
because the first car
takes the hit in an ambush .
are you going to ... take care of me ?
yes , i am .
good .
i need to ask you something .
you never ask me about my , you know , about my business ,
about valhalla .
why is that ?
i just ...
assume you &apos;ll tell me when you &apos;re ready to tell me .
there is something i want to tell you .
ok .
i was gonna get you the ring , but , uh ,
you said you &apos;re not the marrying type .
it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s beautiful .
look at me .
i am valhalla .
i have no idea what kind of life we &apos;re gonna have , but ...
i just want you in mine .
sir , tsa got a hit on one of clyde easter &apos;s covers .
he &apos;s on a plane to boston as we speak .
have him detained as soon as he steps off . we need to go .
garcia , you &apos;re coming with us .
ok , yes .
your government &apos;s gonna hear about this .
will you call the british consulate , please ?
british consulate , now !
step back , sir .
you &apos;re being detained as a suspect in a murder investigation .
wonderful .
hey , it &apos;s me .
hotch asked me to try all your numbers ,
and i have this as an old listing ,
and you probably don &apos;t even use it anymore .
but if it is you and you &apos;re out there ,
come home , please .
god , emily , what did you think ,
that we would just let you walk out of our lives ?
i am so furious at you right now !
then i think about how scared you must be ,
how you &apos;re in some dark place all alone .
but you &apos;re not alone , ok ? you are not alone .
we are in that dark place with you .
we are waving flashlights and calling your name .
so if you can see us , come home .
if you can &apos;t , then ...
then you stay alive .
&apos;cause we &apos;re coming .
i only want doyle . where &apos;s doyle ?
right here , love .
right here .
there it is .
hello , love .
emily walked into a trap .
it looks like doyle got into the suv .
but from this angle , you can see that he didn &apos;t ,
which i wish boston p.d.
would have told me before i started watching it .
sorry again for the screaming .
she threw a flash @-@ bang grenade into a car .
she &apos;s lucky the 3 people inside didn &apos;t die .
is anybody else bothered by that ?
well , 3 bad guys .
illegal as it is , i think prentiss knows
she has to be as ruthless as doyle .
he &apos;s come to the u.s. to wage a public vendetta
and hired a group of mercenaries to remain loyal to him .
he has nothing to lose , so she has to act the same way .
so how did doyle know she was waiting for him ?
well , the mole must have told him , right ?
the same guy who &apos;s been feeding doyle the contractors and agents ?
and our best suspect was
just arrested with a suitcase full of cash .
how do we get easter to talk ?
he won &apos;t cooperate willingly .
i &apos;ll handle that .
the rest of you focus on doyle &apos;s location .
i hate to be the one to ask this ,
but how long does emily have ?
her best chance is also the most troubling .
doyle saved her for last
because he views her as his stressor .
which means he &apos;ll take his time .
where &apos;s my ring ?
i flushed it .
i spent 7 years in hell
because of that ring .
so now i &apos;m going to give you another gift ,
one you won &apos;t get rid of so easily .
a four @-@ leaf clover
should be a nice addition
to your other tattoos .
you still have two , right ?
yep .
and that &apos;s enough ink , thanks .
ink ?
north koreans can &apos;t afford ink .
no , no . they brand themselves .
the more you fight , the more this will hurt .
get your hands off me ! do you know who i am ?
i &apos;m the man !
who &apos;s that ?
jack fahey , irish mob .
he called easter &apos;s cell phone 12 times in 6 hours .
any connection to doyle ?
boston p.d. says he &apos;s low level .
but the irish mob
has long @-@ standing ties to the i.r.a.
see if you can get anything out of him .
why are you doing this ?
why are you keeping me alive ?
hey . fbi grabbed fahey .
her people .
it won &apos;t be long before he starts squealing
and they &apos;re banging on our door .
do what you have to ,
so we get the hell out of here .
i know what you want .
do you , really ?
you want lauren reynolds back .
i can do that . i can be her .
you think that &apos;ll save your skin ?
i have no illusions .
but i &apos;m tired of this .
of being afraid .
we don &apos;t have time for this .
we &apos;ll make time .
what about fahey ?
i &apos;ll take care of fahey .
he smokes , right ?
aye .
looks like you earned yourself a reprieve .
october 2006 .
&quot; in closing , i have never
worked with a finer agent than emily prentiss .
her skill at analyzing and predicting
terrorist behavior is unparalleled . &quot;
signed , name redacted .
you used all the right buzzwords ,
told us everything we wanted to hear .
you sold her to us the same way you sold doyle
to the north koreans .
just because you know how i profile
doesn &apos;t mean you know me .
it takes a skilled sociopath to betray his team
and the cause he held dear for self @-@ preservation .
if you cooperate with us and we save agent prentiss ,
then maybe we could talk about a deal .
but if anything happens to her ,
i will destroy you .
you can count on that .
she said you were the best .
i &apos;m unimpressed .
we &apos;ll get doyle with or without you .
pack lightly . guantanamo gets humid .
nice try .
oh , but--but i &apos;m curious ...
if i &apos;m a sociopath ,
i should feel no empathy , correct ?
you &apos;re not the sociopath .
doyle is .
i thought you were a better profiler .
why were you calling clyde easter so much , jack ?
anybody got a smoke ?
how about you , beanpole ?
what do you think ?
narcissism masking deep @-@ seated insecurity .
so if we puncture his self @-@ image ,
this hood rat will talk .
hey , hey , hey , i ain &apos;t no hood rat .
you take that back .
well , you look like one . you smell like one .
you smell that ?
hood rat .
i am not !
take it back !
hey , jack .
do you know what a hood rat is ?
you see what i mean ?
he &apos;s just gonna have to learn the hard way .
all right , all right , look ,
clyde was gonna pay my medical bills ,
all right ? this ear , it ain &apos;t growing back .
what happened to it ?
this bitch teammate of his shot it . said it was a warning .
thought she could take on
this i.r.a. big shot named doyle .
so i told these--aah !
what the hell , man ? ! jeez !
where &apos;s prentiss ?
who ? i don &apos;t know !
lauren reynolds . where is lauren reynolds ?
friend of yours , is she ?
you tell us where she is right now ,
or i swear , i &apos;ll send you to a prison
where they &apos;ll teach you
what a hood rat is .
and by the time you do ,
she &apos;ll be in pieces .
so , uh ...
my price just went up .
200,000 ?
what other leverage do we have ?
is he an addict ?
he &apos;s having a nicotine fit .
we wouldn &apos;t let him smoke .
we could use that .
he &apos;d relax , open his big mouth .
is that enough ?
well , i &apos;m pretty good with narcissists .
dated a few .
and what is it you do ...
lauren ?
i &apos;m looking to get into business
with a former i.r.a. captain
who &apos;s gone freelance .
valhalla .
but since this is sensitive ...
let me out of these .
that &apos;s not how it went .
i can &apos;t make you happy in handcuffs .
you really think i &apos;d let you fool me twice ?
i just wanted ...
i know what you wanted--
a way into my head .
but i changed the locks .
so you &apos;re going to suffer the way i suffered .
this won &apos;t be the first time you &apos;ve killed an innocent ,
but it will be the first time you have to watch .
liam !
you know when a cigarette is best ?
after sex with me .
mind your manners .
all right . whoa , whoa .
you &apos;re already extorting us for prentiss &apos; location .
so , just out of curiosity ,
what &apos;s it like working for doyle ?
eh , he &apos;s not so tough .
you got him ?
acquiring .
which one &apos;s the target ?
no !
this was about you and me !
that &apos;s what you said ! you and me !
then why is your team here ?
&apos;cause i didn &apos;t leave a trail .
ian ...
whatever you want to do to me , i accept ,
but leave them out of it .
yes , except i didn &apos;t bring them into it , did i ?
what are you thinking ?
woman first , then the goateed fella .
and then fahey if he has a shot . if not , he &apos;ll shut up .
yeah . sounds about right .
shoot fahey .
if he dies , my team doesn &apos;t have anything .
hello , lauren .
good to see you again .
wow . i bet you &apos;re his hookup , aren &apos;t you ?
i mean , after all , you &apos;re the man .
i could show you how much of a man i really am .
all right , all right , all right , jeez .
what &apos;s with the sexy cop / bad cop routine ?
what do you two think--
down !
that &apos;s not going to come out .
yeah , i know .
ashley , we have a problem .
without fahey , there &apos;s not much left .
we all want to save prentiss so bad
that we can &apos;t see this case straight .
ok . what do we do ?
we depend on the team member with the freshest eyes .
oh , no . not me , no .
you haven &apos;t worked with prentiss
for 5 years . you &apos;re unprejudiced .
now , what &apos;s been bugging you since we left quantico ?
how about the affair ?
that bugs me .
how does the two of them
sleeping together change doyle &apos;s profile ?
i don &apos;t know .
come on , ashley .
it &apos;s textbook .
i haven &apos;t read every textbook .
you want me to hold your hand ? fine . what doesn &apos;t fit ?
just say it !
what are you thinking ? spit it out !
why families ?
keep going .
prentiss is doyle &apos;s stressor .
he wants revenge on the woman who betrayed him ,
and i understand that .
but why kill that child in d.c. ?
that &apos;s the agent seaver i &apos;m looking for .
come on .
let &apos;s get you a new shirt .
so , assuming clyde isn &apos;t the mole ,
we looked through the jtf &apos;s presonal records again ,
and jeremy made some fancy plans before his death .
specifically , he bought a large estate in spain ...
he signed all the documents with one of his covers .
made a down payment in cash , deposited the rest .
so jeremy sold the list to doyle .
he was the first victim , killed quietly .
doyle didn &apos;t want any attention until he was ready .
did tsia know ?
i can &apos;t tell .
if i were running from a terrorist ,
i would cash in my i.r.a. not that one .
the other-- you know what i mean .
my point is , tsia didn &apos;t touch that money ,
so i don &apos;t think she &apos;s in on it .
did you know that jeremy sold the list to doyle ?
i had my suspicions .
so when you got to d.c. , you couldn &apos;t trust tsia , either .
prentiss read your doubt as duplicity and so did we .
well , you could have just asked me who doyle &apos;s plant was .
would you have told me ?
no .
someone we both care about is in trouble .
i need the original profile when doyle was a terrorist .
we combine that with who he is now as a serial killer .
agent hotchner , you took an oath
to protect the laws of your country ,
and i took one to protect the secrets of mine .
do you understand what you &apos;re asking ?
i know it &apos;s not easy .
i &apos;ll do it .
if you join me .
you see , there &apos;s no catching that man .
he &apos;d escape from your prison as easily as he did north korea .
and then , all hell breaks loose .
if you want to stop that man ,
you have to put a bullet between his eyes yourself .
can you do that ?
can you break your oath , agent hotchner ?
no .
can you take one , then ?
can you swear
that your team will save her ?
yes .
the british consul &apos;s here .
could you tell him i &apos;ll be right out ?
i &apos;m consulting with the bau on a case .
ian doyle &apos;s a power @-@ assertive psychopath ,
highly controlling and very explosive
when something doesn &apos;t go as planned .
ok , so how does this fit
in with who he is as a family annihilator ?
and prentiss &apos; role in it .
annihilators have a romanticized view of who their family is .
well , actually , he was an orphan .
well , they think of family as their possession ,
until some law shatters that and starts them killing .
but doyle was never married .
children ?
no .
you run your profile
that he carried out his murders
with surgical @-@ like precision .
yes .
with no collateral damage .
that &apos;s right .
perhaps this child was a surrogate for one he had .
say doyle had a child and you didn &apos;t know about it .
is it possible that prentiss did ?
then why would she keep it from me ?
who else was in the compound
the day that you arrested doyle ?
just his staff .
all irish ?
yeah .
that &apos;s a start .
when fahey told me you were in the city ,
he said you already knew where i was .
if that &apos;s the truth ,
you know what this is about .
game &apos;s over , love .
time for your last confession .
take me to where he died .
i want to see it .
breathe , just breathe .
4 , 5 , 6 ...
7 , 8,
9 , 10 .
ready or not , here i come !
aww , i &apos;m gonna get you ! i &apos;m gonna get you !
i don &apos;t see you . i don &apos;t see you .
aah ! i &apos;m gonna get you !
hi .
louise .
come take your boy , please .
you ever think about that ?
having kids ?
be a little hard with what we do , don &apos;t you think ?
maybe you need the right man to do it with .
and a son who &apos;s crazy about you .
i ... i thought
he was your housekeeper &apos;s .
louise raises declan so no one can use him against me .
but he &apos;s mine .
and he needs a mother .
i can &apos;t do that .
not here .
then i &apos;ll get you out .
or ...
i could get you out .
i have resources .
contacts . he would be safer .
and he &apos;d have a father .
you know what i am , lauren .
a warrior .
i lead warriors .
i raise warriors .
i can &apos;t just leave .
you want me to raise your son
so he can have your life ?
is it that bad a life ?
there are so many things
i would do to make you happy .
but ...
i can &apos;t do this .
go to your father .
&quot; go to your father . &quot; that &apos;s what you said .
i never told anyone the truth about declan .
you were the only one .
and you put him in your profile , didn &apos;t you ?
yes .
for 2 years , i didn &apos;t talk .
the north koreans used everything you gave them against me .
it wasn &apos;t until they showed me these ...
they laughed at me as i wept .
and you caused all of this , didn &apos;t you ?
yes , i did .
that corner right there , that &apos;s where he died .
and that &apos;s where i &apos;m going to kill you .
there &apos;s something you don &apos;t know
about those photos .
i got him ! i matched irish immigration records
based on doyle &apos;s employees . declan jones ,
he &apos;s the only boy who matches .
he settled in boston 8 years ago ,
adoptive guardian louise jones .
i knew louise jones . she was doyle &apos;s housekeeper .
are they still alive ?
declan and his mother went missing
7 years ago .
bodies were never found . wait , what is this ? uh ...
god , someone took pictures of them being shot .
is there an address ?
that looks like a warehouse .
it &apos;s gotta be big enough to house a small army .
that &apos;s weapons , supplies .
let &apos;s see--which means it has its own perimeter .
i got it , 1518 adams street .
after your arrest , i relocated
louise and declan .
and then i got a call .
interpol had sent back our profile .
the head of the terrorism division
wanted more dirt on you so they could break you .
so you used my son as a promotion .
no .
i wouldn &apos;t let him be a pawn .
the things they would have done to him
to get you to talk ...
but i knew ,
even if i didn &apos;t cooperate ,
they were going to find him eventually .
so i had to-
had to what ? !
i had to end his suffering
before it could begin .
wait , wait , look at that .
morgan , come look at this .
what did you do ? uhh !
you put him in the profile . what else did you do ?
i put him in the profile
after the pictures were taken .
it &apos;s black clothing and a hand , reid .
no , look at the fingernails .
oh , my god !
you don &apos;t know when those pictures were taken .
you don &apos;t know that .
yes , i do .
i &apos;m the one holding the gun .
you want to hear his lasts words to me ?
he said ,
&quot; i looked pretty good for a dead kid , didn &apos;t i ? &quot;
and then he got on the plane
and i never saw him again .
he &apos;s alive ? !
just because i held a gun to him
doesn &apos;t mean i shot him .
i only had to make you and the north koreans
believe he was dead .
agent prentiss is the only friendly in the building .
rescuing her is our primary objective .
our only advantage here is stealth .
once they know we &apos;re on site ,
there &apos;s nothing to stop them from killing her .
so we keep it quiet until we get to her .
i know you &apos;re lying !
i beat you , ian ...
before you even got out of north korea .
i beat you .
&apos;cause i gave declan his life back .
i &apos;ll find him .
no , you won &apos;t .
ever since you told me my people had fahey ,
i &apos;ve been stalling you .
cut the power .
where is he ? where &apos;s declan , emily ?
tell me . tell me .
where is he ?
emily , tell me where he is .
no .
i got her !
i got her in the basement on the south side . i need a medic .
