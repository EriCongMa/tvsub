Ellen agreed to help me look into my father
before she disappears into WITSEC again.
They found me.
Who?
Trust Sam.
I was undercover with the Flynn organization.
They were a local crime family with some P.D. on the payroll.
Including my father?
His testimony brought down almost the entire organization.
I'd really like you to meet Peter.
No feds, or I'm gone.
You investigated me.
I investigate anyone who comes into Neal's life.
Did he send you?
He doesn't know I'm here.
I don't know if he was followed
or his investigationnto me raised a red flag.
Whose investigation?
Peter, from the FBI.
They found him because of you.
They found ellen because of you.
Neal.
We are done.
Fixed the coffee machine.
I didn't know it was broken.
Been pouring mud for the last two weeks.
Had to decalcify the basket myself.
They teach you that at Quantico?
So sue me for wanting a better cup of joe.
Here, take a sip of that.
Thanks, but I'm cutting back on my caffeine consumption.
So, the panel -- I thought we'd lead with the Dutchman.
Good.
Dutchman's good.
Our first case together.
Can't go wrong with the Dutchman.
No.
Well, we better leave soon.
Yep.
Great. You want a ride over?
I'll meet you there.
Thought you were cutting down.
Oh, I passed a syphon-brew place on the way, couldn't resist.
See your I.Ds, please.
Go ahead.
This is the 53rd Annual Best Practices Conference.
They only invite the top agents from each district.
This is the first time the FBI has featured a panel
on the handler/C.I. relationship at this conference.
It's a big deal for us.
You mean for you.
No, for us.
We have the highest closure rate
of any C.I. Team in the country.
They want to know what makes our partnership work.
I've been wondering the same thing lately.
All right, enough. I know you're upset.
We'll find Sam again.
You shouldn't have run his name.
The moment you contacted him --
Yeah, he disappeared. I know.
After someone ransacked his place.
Look, I'm sorry that happened,
but I did the right thing.
They're expecting a team out there on stage.
And because you're such a damn good con man,
That's exactly what we're gonna give them.
That's the Neal Caffrey I know and love.
Let's go.
When did you two realize you'd make such an effective pair?
Oh, right away, would be my answer.
I mean, we've always worked well together,
From our first chase...
To our first case.
Well, can you elaborate on that first case?
Sure.
It started when...
Peter needed my help.
I needed your advice.
I-I was pursuing a counterfeiter named Curtis Hagen.
Ah, the notorious Dutchman.
Yeah, that's right.
And Peter didn't know his name
until I identified Hagen's initials on a bond that he'd forged.
Well, like Neal,
Hagen had the hubris to sign his work.
Fortunately, my C.I. could recognize a kindred spirit.
Well, is that why Mr. Caffrey works so well with you?
His insights?
He works well with me
because I set effective boundaries.
Oh, yeah. So true.
For example, the first time we met Hagen
was actually at a church that was under restoration,
so the priest wouldn't let us in,
that is, until Peter gave me the green light
to feed the priest a story.
So Peter authorized you to mislead a priest!
Yes. - No, it was --
It was a harmless story.
Basically, I just suggested
that Agent Burke was struggling with issues of fidelity.
I wasn't. I wasn't.
We have an all-systems security breach.
We need to clear the conference halls immediately.
I hate to cut this short,
but we have technical difficulties,
So, schedules permitting,
We'll try for a follow-up conversation tomorrow.
Thank you, Agent Peter Burke and Mr. Neal Caffrey.
Thank you.
Everything okay?
It appears that we have a security breach.
What's the matter?
Somebody sabotaged the meeting hall's central security room.
Really?
Yeah, I'm headed there now.
Mind if I join?
This is New York city -- my jurisdiction.
It's this way.
Thanks. You can head home. I'll call you if I need you.
See ya.
I demand an answer.
Moz, what's going on?
You have an intruder, but he isn't talking -- yet.
I was here waiting for you when he showed up.
Okay, calm down.
I will calm myself when he's given me a name.
Not until you give me a name.
Might I remind you who has the upper hand in this situation?
Moz, this is Sam.
I knew that.
I didn't want to have to use this.
Neither did I.
Okay.
Great. I brought a corkscrew to a gun fight.
This is mozzie. You can trust him.
Just like I can trust your friend at the FBI?
Oh, sticks and stones, pistol man.
He's not a fan of the FBI.
Or law enforcement.
Or government or corporate-sponsored governance.
But there's no one I would trust more with my life.
Your apartment was ransacked.
I thought you'd go underground for good.
I'm not stopping till these guys are taken down.
It's just a question of whether or not I work alone.
I think we got everyone we need in this room right now.
No suit?
No Peter, but we still need the FBI.
And not in the way you think.
You were found because Peter put your name
in an official report.
There no way to trace who saw that report.
Whoever's behind this has access to the FBI's files.
You're right.
And they'll be waiting for your name to pop up again.
So we make Samuel Phelps resurface
but on our terms.
Yeah.
And we draw out whoever's after me.
At the conference this morning...
Glad you could join us.
Glad to be here.
...someone sabotaged the security system
and erased all the camera footage today.
There is a new technologies display
with plenty of state-of-the-art equipment,
all of it valuable on the black market.
You think a thief is casing the place?
Possibly.
So why are we looking at the conference registry?
Because I flagged an irregularity.
This lists everyone who scanned their credentials
at the conference today.
An Agent Bradshaw checked in twice.
I spoke with him earlier today.
He confessed to having a few drinks at the hotel bar
and misplaced his credentials for approximately 20 minutes.
Someone lifted them.
That's more than enough time to clone credentials.
He later found them on the floor.
And, out of embarrassment, kept it to himself.
How many agents are in attendance this year?
About 500.
And one of them is an imposter.
Yeah.
Someone brazen enough to pull a heist
in a room full of FBI agents.
I like him already.
These are the newest high-tech gadgets
being unveiled at the conference this week.
Now, which of these would be worth forging your way
past 500 federal agents?
Those mini motion detectors would appeal to a cat burglar.
Cams would cut the risk on a bank job.
Oh. Is that a digital tracker?
Got it. The conference is a candy store to thieves.
So, never mind the "What?" Let's talk about the "Who?"
Well, nothing's been taken yet,
so the imposter could still be in there.
Good. So how do we spot him?
We have over 500 people to consider.
I'm convinced there's a secret FBI handshake,
and now is the time to use it.
There is no secret handshake.
Of course that's what you'd say.
That gives me an idea.
Jones, diana,
I assume you have your badges.
Of course.
Right here.
That's how we ferret out the imposter.
We hit the most well-attended panels.
Identity theft's in an hour.
It's always packed.
They pass out cookies.
Are we all set to record this?
All good.
This panel is about identity theft.
If you think you're immune because you're trained agents,
think again.
I think you all know Neal Caffrey,
A C.I. for the bureau.
Thank you, sir.
If everyone would please stand.
Now, I am a convicted bond forger,
but I'm also known,
allegedly, for being pretty good at something else.
And a few minutes ago,
I pickpocketed one of your bureau I.Ds.
So, who's missing an I.D.?
Anyone?
Anybody?
All right,no takers.
Oh! Agent Furlong.
Think this belongs to you, sir.
You're kidding me.
I'm not.
That wasn't the deal.
While I distracted you
by picking a piece of lint off your suit.
Right. A valuable lesson.
Thank you, Mr. Caffrey.
Oh, it's my pleasure, sir.
Enjoy the cookies.
Let's bring up the panels.
Nicely done.
Thanks.
I always love a chance to scare a roomful of FBI agents.
Back in a sec. I'm gonna thank Agent Furlong.
That was a pretty bold move.
Somebody had to do it.
Anybody look suspicious?
No, nothing yet.
Thanks for being a good sport, Walt.
You could've told me he was gonna steal my I.D.
Yeah, I apologize for that. He didn't tell.
I've got a favor to ask you.
Another one.
Yeah.
You've been in the D.C. area for quite a while now, haven't you?
Going on about 30 years.
I'm looking into a retired cop -- Sam Phelps.
Worked undercover for metro.
Phelps.
I don't know him, but I could ask around.
Thanks. I owe you one.
I owe you two.
All right, well, how about you and Caffrey
finish up your panel, we call it even?
Everyone wants to know more about you two.
Although, uh, maybe you skip the rest of that priest story.
Good idea.
Gordon's birthday party -- are we going to this?
The big "Lebowlski," again?
You love bowling.
No, you love bowling.
Well, that's because I'm inexplicably good at it.
Come on. It'll be fun.
Eh, maybe.
My conference was supposed to be fun.
The panel with Neal not go well?
We pulled it off.
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
I really thought reaching out to Sam was a good idea.
I thought Sam did, as well.
I don't know how they caught on to him
or who caught on to him,
but he could've handled it better before skipping town.
Do you know where Sam went?
No.
I've got Walt Furlong asking around in D.C.,
see if his contacts can find him.
Well, if Walt finds anything, you need to tell Neal.
I will, but I don't think he'll want to hear it.
You didn't want to hear about the bowling party,
but we are going.
And we are gonna bring home that trophy again, right?
Right?
Yes.
Right? Yes.
Yes.
Here you go.
So, how did things go at the suit convention?
We're back to a status quo I can work with.
Oh, so he's suspicious you're up to something,
and you're aware he's watching you like a redtail.
Hell of a dynamic you got there.
Well, it has its perks.
I could slip out with one of these.
What is it?
State-of-the-art government tracker.
It embeds in the skin like a tick.
The subject is completely unaware it's there.
So we bait whoever's after Sam,
then plant that in them.
How do we bait out our target?
Surveillance-authorization form.
We plant information to lure out whoever came after you.
Only this time, we control the circumstances.
We need a secure location.
We can use Friday,
my third-favorite safe house.
All right, it takes eight hours for this form to be processed.
If we file it tomorrow morning,
our surprise guest could show up before nightfall.
Won't a couple of agents end up sitting on the safe house?
If Peter doesn't know he's authorized,
then he won't assign anyone to it.
Great. So, forge his signature.
Unfortunately, I can't forge it.
It's not quite that simple.
See, first thing every Thursday morning,
Diana readies a stack of surveillance requests for Peter to sign.
Once he finishes,
she takes them directly to the agent in charge of logging them.
No weak links in the chain.
That means you're gonna have to con Peter.
Yeah, which won't be easy.
Surveillance authorizations -- must be Thursday.
Now, Diana preps the forms, but Peter scans each one
and double-checks the count when he's done.
Eight of them this week.
Can you replace one of the forms with your fake?
I could, but Peter likes to switch up the color of ink
he uses when he signs his name.
It's a habit of his since we started working together.
Incredibly paranoid and presumptive of him.
I respect that.
The only way to pull this off
is to trick Peter into signing the document himself.
You're gonna need a distraction.
Any leads on our FBI imposter?
I'll let you know when there is.
What's the one thing that can infiltrate anywhere in New York,
including the FBI building?
Micro-drones.
Keep going.
Vermin.
Yes. May I borrow Percy?
My pet rat --
He eats all the fancy cheeses that I...Can't.
In many ways, I live through him.
Many ways?
Don't get him started.
Once Peter's scanned the last form,
but before he signs it...
Rat! Rat!
Can I get a little help here?!
What is going on?
Rat!
Please tell me that's a chihuahua.
Look at the size of that tail!
I'm not going there.
Wait a second. Okay.
All right.
Somebody call the exterminator?
For every one you see, there's about 10 you don't see.
Hey, I saw "Ratatouille."
Anybody got eyes on that thing?!
Anybody?!
And if all that works...
Six, seven, eight.
There you go.
...The bait will be set.
Any luck finding our mystery guest?
Four agents didn't immediately pat their pockets.
Oh, that's Bob Sanders. He was hung over.
That guy's busy checking his BlackBerry.
And she's yawning.
And the fourth?
Not an agent.
I just got the facial-recognition results.
Meet Ted Anderson.
He was a force reconnaissance Marine in the Gulf War.
After that, he did five years in Iraq -- freelance security.
Lately he's been consulting with some well-known tech companies.
Private security?
It doesn't say.
Why hide the fact that he's working security?
Because he's engaged in corporate espionage.
Sounds right.
The only question is,
which of the items is he after?
Let's talk to him and find out.
But I don't want to spook him.
He might already recognize us from the panel.
Jones and Diana will do the meet.
Let's get eyes on Anderson and make this happen.
Furlong e-mailed me Sam's retirement information.
Let me guess -- shuffleboard after breakfast,
Chess at 2:00, dinner at 4:00?
Unknown.
All it shows is that he retired
on a boat in southern Florida.
Florida?
Yeah, when Neal first reached out to Sam,
he was in D.C.
Now Furlong is telling me
that Sam retired to the sunshine state.
You want me to look into it?
No, I want you to get ready for the Anderson meet.
I'll reach out to the people in Miami,
see if they can tell us what he's been doing down there.
Without making an official report.
Maybe I'm interviewing FBI retirees
for an alumni newsletter.
Agent Burke, the writer.
You buy it?
No.
But you could sell it.
Checked Anderson's credit cards.
For the last week, he's been hitting up a coffee shop
across from the meeting hall at 10:00 a.m.
Probably doing his recon.
That's in 30. If he's there,
try and get him to talk without knowing we're onto him.
Gotcha.
Hi, this is Agent Peter Burke,
New York White Collar Division.
How are things in Miami today?
Thank you. Take care.
What do you think you're doing?
I'm taking my break.
Have you seen this?
No, I haven't seen this. What's going on?
Some sort of security screw-up yesterday.
Now they're rearranging security protocol
and shifting panel times!
This is your job. Come fix it.
Hey! Fine. Can I just finish my muffin?
No!
Can I help you?
Well, I was really hoping
I could, uh, see The Hudson Group panel.
Maybe you could tell me what time that's at.
No. Your break is over!
Yeah, she's a real charmer, isn't she?
Maybe you should get a nicer boss.
You know what? I would if I could.
Hey, man, maybe you could help me out.
Yeah, look, I don't know, man.
It'd piss her off if I did, you know? I...
Yeah, it would, wouldn't it?
Gonna stick it to her, huh? Okay.
Hudson panel.
You're lucky.
Hudson Group is the same time -- 2:00.
Thanks, man. Appreciate it.
Any time.
I like you all fiery.
Me too.
Looking for this?
Thank you.
Couldn't resist?
You caught me.
Doesn't have that rusty chalk taste.
Th's a vinegar decalcification --
Ah, no spoilers.
Let me enjoy it.
So, we may be able to get to finish our panel.
Great.
Think we can skip my blasphemy
and disregard of the seventh commandment?
Are you sure? Because I have a great joke
that starts with you and a priest walking into a bar.
Neal. - All -- all right.
We get to finish the Dutchman story.
We'll do it right.
You ever wonder what would've happened
if I hadn't made you my C.I.?
I'd still be in jail,
and your arrest rate would be in the low 70s.
High 80s.
Why did you take my deal?
I told you -- your expertise.
That's all?
I realized all those crimes you were committing,
they were never about money or greed.
What do you think they were about?
The challenge.
That's what we have in common.
I love the challenge.
I know you do.
And after all those years of chasing you,
your cryptic clues,
your late-night phone calls from international numbers.
All the cookies and birthday cards.
Yeah.
I realized I liked you.
That's why I took your deal.
Any word from Sam?
Well, he said he's leaving town.
I'm sure he did say that.
We'll find him.
Yeah.
Anderson is targeting a cutting-edge bulletproof vest
from The Hudson Group.
Word is, this will be the best protection on the market.
My favorite kind of protection
is avoiding situations where people might shoot at me.
The Hudson Group is unveiling its sole working prototype
at the conference today.
If Anderson gets his hands on it,
whoever hired him can reverse-engineer the technology.
Could be worth billions.
We can grab Anderson for impersonating a federal agent.
I'm sure he's disposed of his fake credentials by now.
Yeah, if we can't prove that he used them,
the most we have on him is trespassing.
We'll never know who hired him.
We'll wait until he makes his move on the vest.
Then we can add several felony counts,
including espionage.
If we're gonna use the vest as bait,
we should contact The Hudson Group.
And get their presenter to come in.
Worked like a charm.
The guy was a trouper.
He returned to the briefcase and everything.
Ah, because I had some caciocavallo cheese
waiting for him.
It was as good as we hoped, wasn't it, Percy?
Hey, if you start acting out scenes
from "Willard" again, I'm leaving.
That the safe house?
Yep.
Like I said --
Private, secure, controlled.
Perfect.
When our guest shows up looking for Sam,
we'll claim ignorance, tag him, and send him on his way.
Okay. So, do you have the tracker?
Not yet -- Anderson's gonna try to steal
a different piece of technology from the conference.
When that happens, I'll seize the window of opportunity.
Piggybacking on a fellow thief.
Taking advantage of a craftsman's hard work.
Okay, you're only saying that
'cause he's going up against the bureau.
One against 500.
I like those odds.
Hey, can you get me Anderson's thumbprint
for my collection?
Yeah. Yeah, I'll work on that.
Did you miss me, Percy?
Talked to The Hudson Group.
The inventor of the vest is in town for the conference.
He's coming in.
That's good.
Everything okay, boss?
Florida confirmed that Sam Phelps
was a resident of the state.
"Was"?
Sam Phelps has been dead for three years.
If Sam's dead, who's Neal been dealing with?
Non-office meeting.
This is about the ominous.
I know the last thing you want to hear right now
is that I looked into Sam again, but...
Why would you do that? We just --
Sam Phelps is dead.
July 17th, three years ago.
He suffered from a heart attack in his boat in Key West.
What are you talking about?
He retired in Florida.
None of this sat right with me from the start.
He didn't want us vetting him with FBI resources,
and now I know why.
Sooner or later, we'd find out
that the real Sam Phelps was dead.
This doesn't necessarily mean Sam isn't who he says he is.
Death certificates don't issue themselves.
No. Coroners do --
for around $500, in my experience.
I may or may not have faked my death on multiple occasions.
Panama City, Bangalore.
Monterey Bay.
I remember -- gored by a great white shark.
Thought you might appreciate that.
Who doesn't love a good shark mauling?
Are you telling me that Sam faked his own death?
Come on. He's had a target on his back for over 30 years.
He was an undercover cop.
I'm sure he has a long list of enemies.
He retired in Florida.
Bought a houseboat.
Okay, then what's your theory?
We've both been alone with Sam.
We're still standing here.
If he's an imposter, what's his end game?
He wants the evidence box that Ellen showed in the video.
Take down the corrupt cops.
Maybe he's one of the corrupt cops.
No.
You have to consider that an option.
Take your time. I know it's a lot to absorb.
Just don't --
Do what I normally do. I got it.
You were right to think Neal was up to something.
What'd he do?
Technically nothing.
You, on the other hand,
authorized a surveillance request on Sam Phelps.
I don't remember doing that.
And yet here's my signature.
The rat.
Oh, he drives me nuts.
No well,
I'm talking about the rat in the office.
That's when he swapped the documents.
Why?
He spent all this time making sure
we kept Sam's name out of the official files.
And now he's put it in himself.
Neal's setting a trap
to lure out whoever has bureau access
and is trying to get to Sam.
What do you want to do?
Find Sam. Bet he's back in town.
I'll be there to see if Neal's trap catches anything.
What's our E.T.A. on Drugov?
His security detail's escorting him in now.
I want a security detail.
You should've invented a vest.
Dr. Drugov, thanks for coming.
I know that you rarely stray from the Hudson facility.
Well, I've been out there.
"Facility" doesn't do it justice.
More like a stronghold.
They keep our research well guarded.
Which makes today's unveiling a rare opportunity for theft.
Nearly six years and over a hundred million
went into the design of this little accessory.
That's a lot of money for a bulletproof vest.
For the bulletproof vest.
The TGV-6 can withstand a greater projectile impulse
than any body armor on the market,
including full-metal rounds.
It disperses the force of the slug.
Like no vest before it.
Being shot in my vest
feels not radically dissimilar from a nice, firm hug,
and it's slim enough to fit under your suit jacket
without a bulge.
Well, Diana doesn't like bulges.
Doctor, we have reason to believe this man,
Ted Anderson, may attempt to steal it.
We'll make sure that doesn't happen.
Tell me about your presentation.
I was hoping to demonstrate the vest's capabilities
by placing it on a live volunteer.
What, and shooting him?
Yes. But they wouldn't let me.
Well, I'm sure it will still be fun.
Has the piggybacking commenced?
Soon. But I want to plant the tracker
on a new target.
And that target is?
Peter has intell that Sam isn't who he says he is.
Okay, is this good intell or government intell?
Do you know where he is?
Yeah, he's on his way here.
We're waiting for you to show up with the tracker,
and then we're gonna go stake out the safe house.
Stall until I get there.
Don't let him out of your sight.
Okay.
Still no sign of him on the monitors.
Nothing here, either.
See anything interesting?
I see a lot of interesting things,
but no Anderson yet.
Boss.
What?
Our team lost Anderson.
When?
Just now.
Anderson just slipped our tail.
I came to this country only six years ago,
and the Hudson Group gave me my dream --
a lab to create life-saving devices
rather than life-taking ones.
And the results?
The best protective body armor on the market today.
I give you TGV-6.
Never before has there been body armor
designed to ensure your safety
as soundly as you ensure the safety and freedom of every American.
Within 24 months, god and congress willing,
this will be standard-issue for each and every one of you.
I still don't have eyes on Anderson.
I'm checking through the stairwells.
Wait. He's here.
Stairwell "D."
Is that semtex?
Boss, you have to evacuate everyone now.
Anderson's planting plastic explosives.
Thanks very much. Excellent.
Thanks, everyone. Quickly as possible, everyone.
Walt, make sure they leave the building.
What about Drugov?
No. No, no, no. I want you out of the building.
Anderson is in here now. Go.
My vest.
I'll take responsibility for that.
Go. Go, come on. Quickly.
Stay with him.
Boss, we're in the stairwell.
No Anderson, no explosives.
What?
Anderson faked the security footage. Why?
He must have hacked into the system
to clear out the building.
The vest is here.
The room is empty. Where's Anderson?
Think -- what the hell is he up to?
I don't know. Maybe we got the wrong target.
What the hell's more valuable than the vest?
The mind that created it.
It's got to be.
This isn't a theft.
It's a kidnapping.
I'll catch up to Drugov at the back exit.
Drugov, get in the van. Get in the van!
Anderson, drop your weapon!
Down, Anderson, down!
Get out of the way. All I want is Drugov.
I can't let you take him, Anderson!
It doesn't have to be like this.
Drugov, just come with me
and you won't get hurt.
You're not leaving here a free man.
Diana, Anderson has me pinned,
and I'm running out of ammo.
Seventh-level parking garage. I need backup.
Go!
I'm out. Throw me a clip.
Keeping an eye on the clock, Anderson?
Probably thought you'd be out of here by now.
I know I would've.
I'm not leaving without him.
What are you doing?
Getting you to safety.
Well, right now, I got 50 guns coming for you.
It is not gonna be pretty.
All available units to level seven of the conference hall parking garage.
Anderson, come on!
All right.
They're back here!
Go! Go, go, go!
Diana, where's my backup?
Neal!
FBI, guns down! You're surrounded!
Hey, you -- gun down.
Neal.
Nice shot.
Yours, not his.
You were wearing the vest.
I thought you avoided these kind of situations.
He shot me in my favorite tie.
Maybe Drugov can make you one to match the vest.
Did it feel like a hug?
Not a gentle hug.
No?
No.
More like a russian bear hug.
yeah.
Moz, listen, there's been a complication.
I didn't get the tracker.
Oh, I can beat that. Fake Sam's gone rogue.
What?
He said he didn't want to involve us.
He left, I assume for the safe house.
What, you didn't stop him?
Um, he carries a gun.
And all I had was the corkscrew.
All right. I'm going to the safe house.
Neal, he said he wants to handle this himself.
Well, what if he can't?
Okay.
I'll -- I'll meet you there.
That's Sam.
Yeah, or so he says.
Well, we're never gonna find out unless we do something.
I'm going.
Neal.
The man who did this is on the other side of that wall.
He's armed.
I'll go around outside
And see if I can get a look at him.
Diana, I need local backup in greenpoint.
Suspect heading on a rooftop, southbound, by the east river.
Sit down here.
Why did you come alone?
I got tired of waiting for answers.
I thought if I threatened whoever showed,
He'd tell me everything.
And I didn't want you getting hurt if things went bad.
He got the jump on you.
Oh, man.
If you hadn't have showed, that would've been it.
Who is he?
Oh, I don't know.
He thought I had Ellen's evidence.
I couldn't convince him otherwise.
He's gone.
You and Mozzie head back to my place.
I'm gonna check on Peter.
Hey. Hey.
This guy doesn't know about you, Neal.
Keep it that way.
All right.
Come on.
Okay.
Did you get a good look at him?
I didn't see his face, but I saw his tattoo.
You put sam's name on one of my surveillance authorizations.
Hey, it worked.
We almost caught Ellen's killer.
Where is Sam or whoever he is?
Mozzie brought him back to my place.
He's gonna keep him there until we know.
Sam's blood.
Run his DNA.
Then we'll know for sure.
Peter, I've got some info.
So, this is caffrey's sketch of that guy's tattoo.
And this is the match that it got us.
Dennis Flynn.
Yeah. It's a variation on his ancestral crest.
The Fynns were an organized-crime family
back in the Baltimore/D.C. area.
Thanks, Jones.
Thank you.
Well, if you need me,
I'll be meeting with the exterminators.
So what's an Irish mobster doing so far from home?
In Ellen's video, she said
my father turned state's evidence after the murder.
But she didn't know who he testified against.
Sam told me it was the Flynns.
My father's testimony put most of them away for good.
Dennis Fynn Sr. died in prison.
This is his son.
Maybe he's here for revenge.
If he is, he's got to be the one who killed Ellen.
Maybe.
But how does a punk like him have access to the FBI database?
Or the marshals' info on her?
Well, he had help.
Ellen and Sam collected evidence
Showing that the corrupt cops were on the Flynns' payroll.
If it is one of the higher-ups in the bureau,
They convince this Flynn kid to do it as revenge
in the name of the father.
Maybe they offered to help him
restart the family business in exchange.
Ah, not now.
What is it?
Agent Furlong rescheduled our panel for this afternoon.
I'll cancel.
No.
Let's do it.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I could use the distraction,
And it'll take organized crime all afternoon
to pull the intel anyway.
You sure?
I am.
This panel's a big deal for us, right?
Yeah.
So, what do you want to talk about up there?
Mortenson loan scandal?
Loan scandal.
Peter, we found a Nazi submarine
dredged up by an infamous ponzi schemer.
That's a story.
Want to talk about what happened
to the contents of that sub?
Point taken.
Hello, gentlemen.
Everyone's excited for your discussion.
Thanks.
Maybe the Yankee Stadium job.
Mm. Mozzie was involved.
Right.
Ooh, I got it. Avery.
Ooh, the airless comic-book vault.
Perfect.
So we're heading down the hallway,
And we need to separate ourselves.
Yeah.
So then Neal trips the security system
to bring down the glass wall.
Yeah, that protected Peter from Avery's shotgun blast.
Yeah.
But the fire-suppression system
Sucked all the oxygen out of the room.
Neal refused to take any of the air
from the mini-breather I was using.
It only gave us five minutes' worth of oxygen
to find the kill switch, which I did.
And then you passed out.
He needed oxygen, so I opened the glass wall,
ready to shoot it out with Avery.
Yeah, and then our team came in from behind, and he gave up.
At least that's what Peter told me.
I was unconscious at the time, so don't hold me to that.
Well, I assume that there's an immense trust
between the two of you.
Usually.
But even when there isn't trust, there's always faith.
Faith.
That whatever the other's doing, it's for a good reason.
As long as peter has faith in me,
I'll have faith in him.
Any idea who Sam really is?
Not yet.
Put a rush on his DNA test -- be back soon.
Are you going back to the office?
Yeah, too restless here.
I want to be there when the results come in.
Which side do you think he's on?
I don't know. His own?
I can't get a read on him.
That's not like you.
Yeah, that's what worries me.
Well, if you had to guess.
This damn evidence box has been the focus of everything.
Ellen said that she found a lot of dirt
on a lot of bad cops.
My gut keeps telling me that he isn't here
to help Neal find the box.
I think he's here because he's in the box.
One of the bad guys.
Yeah.
If there are things in there that link him to crimes,
to murders...
If I were him, I'd want it.
Enough reason to pull a long con.
Yeah. It is.
I'll know soon.
Bye.
See ya, honey.
Results of the blood sample?
Yeah.
It belongs to a D.C. Cop, all right.
It just isn't Samuel Phelps.
Hey. You holding up?
Trying to. Any leads?
We'll know who we're dealing with soon enough.
Excuse me.
Got the results back on Sam.
Peter, he's here.
There's something...
Something you have to know, Neal.
You okay?
Why didn't you tell me?
Tell you what?
That you're my father.
