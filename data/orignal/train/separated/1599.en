I cheated on my boyfriend
and I lost my virginity to Wyatt, Callie's ex-boyfriend.
I got a grandma.
Is she...
She's in a home. She got dementia.
Look, I ran your brother's name through the system.
He hasn't been arrested.
If he's not in jail, can you see if he's dead?
'Cause he's all I got.
I went to juvie to talk with A.J.,
We've decided I'm going to foster him.
It's going to take some time for Mike to get his license.
In the meantime, A.J.'s going to stay here with us.
I got fired from the drop-in center because of you.
Brandon, you'll be working with Kat.
There's no way you're pairing me with him.
You and Kat, setting me up.
You get me to that party...
and when I don't show up to work in the morning,
I look like a flake...
Dude, that's insane!
Is it?
I might have to deal with her, but I don't have to deal with you.
You signed your name to a bach fugue?
And I knew you would say it was crap.
I've had enough of you two making a joke of this program.
You're out!
Sorry. Sorry...
What are you doing in my room?
I need you to come with me.
Why?
I need your help with something.
Oh, with what?
I will tell you later.
Just get dressed and then meet me outside. Okay?
Okay.
And bring your car keys. Come on.
Morning!
Morning.
Oh, am I too early?
Too early for what?
Ah, Oscar! You're here.
Mrs. Foster, hello.
I thought you were starting on Monday.
No, we said today, right?
Yeah, you told me sooner the better.
Wait, you hired a contractor?
I was gonna talk to you about it this weekend.
Oh, I see, and by "talk to me about it,"
you mean you were gonna pretend like I had some say in this.
Honey, we had to make a decision.
Except we didn't make a decision, you did.
If this is a bad time...
No, no, no, no, no. We've waited long enough.
Come on in. Go straight through. You know where you're going.
Okay.
All right. Thanks, Oscar.
Okay...
If I have to share a bathroom with those kids for one more day,
I'm going to kill myself.
Now, I realize to you that sounds good right about now,
but getting all of those quotes was taking forever.
You want to handle something all by yourself?
The raccoons got into the garbage.
Okay...
Callie, we're almost at the border.
Yeah.
Okay. Well, if we keep going,
we're gonna, you know, be in Mexico.
Okay, see... mexico is another country
and if we cross that border our moms will kill us.
Look, there's something I have to do
that I'm not really allowed to do in the state of California.
At least not without parental consent.
Like something illegal?
Callie...
Hi, love, I know you're mad and I'm sorry to bother you...
We need to go to therapy.
What?
We've got to start communicating.
Okay, if this is about what just happened, I take complete blame.
It's me. It's my fault, all right?
It's not just a one-time thing.
We have to learn how to do better.
We're communicating right now! We're...
Sure, we talk.
But most times I don't feel heard.
Well, I wasn't feeling heard
when I told you that I was frustrated
with your endless stream of contractor quotes.
See, this is what I'm talking about.
I tell you something that's bothering me
and you turn it right back around on me.
What...
We're never gonna get anywhere
if we keep pointing the finger at each other.
that's why we need a neutral third party to...
What? To tell us that you're right and I'm wrong?
No! To help us both learn how to listen...
Okay. Jenna and Kelly went to therapy
And where are they? They broke up.
Well, by the time they started going, it was too late.
Okay, speaking of too late, does this happen to belong to you?
Or is this something that you
prefer to say with a neutral third party around?
Busted.
I've been having an affair with Mr. Nesbit next door,
and now I'm pregnant with an inflatable snowman.
Well, that's actually preferable to the other scenarios
running around in my head right now.
Sorry. Can you get that for me?
Oh, my...
not a problem.
Someone in this house is afraid they're pregnant
and I think we should find out who it is.
Morning.
How's my love bug?
Sorry about all the noise.
Where's Callie?
Um, she said she was going
to the library to work on her history paper.
And why are you still in bed?
Day off.
Everything okay?
Yeah. Everything's fine.
Good.
And everything's okay with Mat?
Actually, we broke up.
Oh, no. Mariana, what happened?
Well, the tour got extended, so...
He's basically gonna be on the road all summer
and I just felt like...
I don't know, like I was holding him back.
From what?
Having fun...
Hooking up with other girls, I guess.
Other girls...
So you and Mat have hooked up?
Well, duh!
We were boyfriend and girlfriend.
Okay.
Did you use a condom?
What?
When you hooked up.
Mama, hooking up doesn't mean sex.
I thought that's what the kids called it now.
Well, it can mean sex,
But it also means a lot of other things.
So...
You and Mat didn't have sex?
No.
Why are you asking?
No reason. I just think it's...
It's good to check in every now and then.
Okay.
So, um...
Did Callie mention when she might be back from the library?
No.
All right.
Last time I was here, she didn't even know who I was.
Still, I bet she enjoys seeing a friendly face, huh?
When all else fails, there's always chocolate, right?
Amen to that.
How are you?
Hi.
It's just, sometimes grandma gets upset...
You want me to go in there with you?
Only if you want to.
Yeah.
Hey, grandma.
Well, look who's here!
I know I'm long overdue,
but it's great to see you. You look good.
Oh, I've seen better days,
and don't you try telling me otherwise.
Here. Let me help you sit down.
How long has it been?
Two months.
No!
I'm afraid so.
Now remind me...
Where have we met?
Uh, miss Hensdale?
Iris, please.
Pleasure to meet you, Iris. My name is Mike Foster.
Oh, dear.
Am I under arrest?
No, no, no. God, no.
No, I'm looking after your grandson now.
My grandson?
Here, grandma, I brought you your favorite.
Oh, I like these better than flowers.
That's what I figured.
So nice to see you.
How long has it been?
I think this is the place.
You're kidding me. Callie, what is this?
You'll see.
Wow, there's like no one here.
Yeah. No one to hear us scream.
We have beaches in San Diego.
What's here that we can't do at home?
That.
Come on, Brandon, it'll be fun.
Callie, I thought this was serious.
Okay? I thought you were in trouble.
Well, so be happy that I'm not.
Okay, I'm sorry I didn't tell you.
I just figured if you knew what we were gonna do,
then you'd probably try to talk me out of it.
Oh, I'm definitely talking you out of it.
We're not hang gliding.
Oh, come on.
If you could have one superpower, what would it be?
Callie... I...
Seriously, answer the question.
I don't know. Like, read minds
or be invisible or something.
Okay. Well, I wanna fly.
Come on, I just got my driver's license.
I'm finally off probation...
I can go anywhere I want to go...
For the first time in my life, I'm free.
I just wanna do something completely nuts.
Well, this qualifies.
Oh, come on. I need this.
All right? And you do, too.
Brandon, I'm...
almost 17 and I don't have any good stories.
That's why I brought you here. I just wanted to do something
completely crazy with my best friend.
Well, it... would make a good story.
Aren't these delicious?
Have you met my grandson?
Uh, yes, I have. He's a good kid.
Isn't he?
He comes to see me every week.
It's not every week, grandma...
But I'll be back soon.
I hope so.
Thanks for the flowers.
It was the chocolates that I brought...
but you're welcome.
It was nice to meet you.
You okay?
Yeah.
It must be hard seeing your grandma like that, I mean...
you guys were pretty close, right?
Not as close as my brother.
She had more good years with him, but yeah, I guess.
He ever visit her?
Used to, yeah.
That look like it say "Ty Hensdale" to you?
Yeah.
According to this, he was here two days ago.
Went straight to voice mail.
Why didn't you leave a message?
What am I gonna say...
"Hey callie, it's mama, just checking
to see if you're pregnant. Give us a call."
No, just that you're checking in and to get in touch.
Are you really gonna micromanage a phone call now?
If you think you can do better, go ahead.
All I'm saying is,
I think it's strange that Callie didn't answer her phone.
Why? She's in a library.
Maybe not.
So she turned off her phone.
They don't turn off their phones, Lena.
They might miss a text or twit...tweet.
I think they snapchat these days.
But then again, I thought that hooking up meant sex.
It doesn't?
Apparently not.
Anyway, my point is,
is that they only turn off
their phones if they don't want us to find them.
Why wouldn't Callie want us to know where she is?
And that's the question, isn't it?
That's it. Light touch.
Now ease out on the control bar and feel the lift.
Move to the right.
Ah, that's it.
Now you're in the lift.
Is that really all there is to this?
Sure.
That plus a 1,000-foot drop.
You guys are naturals.
Close to listos.
He thinks we're ready.
So, now we're signing the release forms.
Okay.
What's it say?
Basically, if we die, it's our own damn fault.
Great!
Except if I die, it's your damn fault.
Not that I have much to live for these days...
Brandon...
I'm kidding.
Though the idea of plummeting to my death
off a 1,000-foot cliff is only slightly less appealing
than telling moms that I got kicked out of Idyllwild.
What happened anyway?
Uh, for starters,
I got paired up with this total diva of a pianist.
Really? That bad?
Worse than you can imagine.
Brilliant, but basically evil.
I mean, she'd just crap on everything I did.
So, to prove a point,
I put my name on this obscure Bach piece...
Wait a second, you plagiarized?
And of course, she called it a steaming pile of...
Right. So she's an idiot.
No, she's not the only one.
I mean, we both got kicked out.
Yeah, that sucks.
Big time.
But, you know, at least it's over...
Now I don't have to deal with anymore crazy,
dramatic women in my life.
I mean, first it was Kat and Talya and...
Life's too short, you know.
Listos?
What the hell, right?
Yeah. What the hell.
We found this card in the flowers
and we're wondering if you remember a young man
who may have bought them from here a couple of days ago?
Uh, African-American, about 20 years old.
Irises. That's what he bought.
Oh, yeah. I remember.
Most men don't go in for irises.
It's more of an old lady flower.
They were for an old lady.
Do you remember how he paid?
You mean like credit card?
Exactly.
Mmm, I don't think so.
I'm pretty sure it was cash.
Yeah, 'cause I remember he didn't have enough money,
and he offered to put a couple of flowers back, but...
I just let him keep the whole dozen anyway. Nice kid.
Did he seem okay?
Yeah. I guess so.
That's my brother. We're trying to find him.
I don't suppose he's come back in?
Sorry.
Did he say anything
that might indicate where he's living?
I wish I had more for you.
But thanks for your time.
You'll call if he comes back in, right?
Of course.
Good luck, guys.
She said she was going to the library.
What else do you want me to say?
Okay.
You wanna rethink that answer and try again?
What? You think I'm lying?
I didn't say that.
It's just when you answered me, you looked up and to the left.
So?
That's what people do when they lie.
How do you know that?
Because I'm a highly trained police officer, Mariana,
and if you don't tell me where Callie is right this second,
you're going to be grounded
until you qualify for social security.
Okay...
they may have gone a little further than the library.
Like how far?
Like... Mexico.
Mexico. Callie went to Mexico?
Just to a beach.
And that's all I know, honest!
Yeah, no, I believe you.
You said "They," Mariana, who is "They"?
Mexico? Together?
Why? Why would they do that?
What? What are you thinking?
I don't even wanna say...
Say!
I just...I can't help thinking about the pregnancy test...
Don't! Don't say that.
Well, you seriously think she went down there to...
but Callie could get whatever
medical attention she would need right here.
What if she doesn't know that?
What if she's afraid that we're going to find out?
Okay, so... what if...what if she is pregnant?
Why is Brandon with her?
Oh, my god.
You don't think that he's the father, do you?
Mariana, get in here!
Okay, hold up!
Callie's pregnant with Brandon's baby?
We don't know that. We don't...
We don't know what to think.
But why would you think that in the first place?
Because of this.
And since it doesn't belong to any of us, we could only assume...
It's mine.
Wait a minute, you told me that you didn't have sex with Mat.
Because I didn't have sex with Mat.
Who did you have sex with?
It's not all bad news.
How you figure that?
Your brother's alive...
And he's okay, and he's been around.
If the florist or anyone at the nursing home sees him,
they'll let us know.
Meanwhile, we'll print up some fliers with his picture, okay?
Don't give up. We're getting close.
You oughta be a detective.
Detective work's pretty dull. The real action's on the street.
Call to any officer in this area,
Report of an 11-7 at 1-2-5 Winston.
Repeat, 11-7 at 1-2-5 Winston.
What's an 11-7?
Prowler on the scene. Probably a burglar. Not far.
Car 74 solo, I'm on my way with a ride-along.
A ride-along? That's me?
Yeah. That's you. Let's go.
Okay, so the first question is,
Are you pregnant?
No, we used a condom.
And I started my period this morning.
Thank god!
So why take a pregnancy test?
I don't know, I was freaking out.
And I felt all weird and moody...
You're a teenager, Mariana, you're always weird and moody.
And I also had a stomachache that one day.
I don't know. I was just afraid.
And mama had all those extra tests
from when she was trying to get pregnant,
And I figured, why not?
It was supposed to make me feel better.
Well, we're not here to make you feel bad.
I guess the next question is why?
Why have sex?
Well, yeah. That, too.
But why have sex with Wyatt?
Well, the plan was to have sex with Mat,
But then he didn't want to...
So he was just backup sex?
No! No, no, no, no!
Look, that came out wrong.
Okay?
I wanted to lose my virginity.
I'm almost 16 and everyone in this house is having sex...
Maybe not Jude or Callie or you guys.
But you gave Brandon and Jesus condoms...
I don't see what the big deal is.
Losing your virginity at 15 is a big deal, Mariana.
I thought you guys were feminists.
Don't play that card.
We said the exact same thing to your brothers.
I don't understand why you think that this is some kind of race.
Well, I did, okay?
And I'm not a virgin anymore, so...
Honey, I think what your mother is trying to say
is just that we love you,
and we wanna understand your choices.
Well, no one's pregnant.
Can't you just be happy about that?
What?
That was harsh.
No, it wasn't. I...
Where is all of this coming from?
I just want us to be on the same page.
Obviously, Mariana feels terrible about this,
What is the point in piling on the shame?
Excuse me.
Can we just table this for a minute, please?
We have two children in Mexico, doing god knows what.
Callie and Brandon are good kids.
They're probably just enjoying a day on the beach.
Are you sure about that?
Scared?
Nah, you?
Nah!
Maybe a little bit.
Yeah, I'm terrified.
Maybe this is a bad idea, you know.
We've had how much instruction?
Uh... couple of hours.
And we know how much about this guy?
Next to nothing.
Exactly.
How do we know he's legit,
or if these gliders even work?
I mean, that could be why they're on a deserted beach
and not a big resort with lawyers and cameras.
Wind is up. It's time.
Maybe we don't need to jump.
Maybe this is all we needed to do, you know?
Just stand on the brink and then step back from it.
You know?
Together...
Together.
Yeah.
I'm okay with that.
Okay.
What? What's he telling us?
To jump!
I don't think I can!
Then I think we're getting arrested.
Okay!
Brandon!
We're flying!
How do we land?
You can do this, all right? We're gonna land.
And remember everything he told you, okay?
Ready?
Callie! Hey! You okay?
That was amazing!
You feel like a superhero?
Yeah. Thank you.
That's gonna make a really good story.
All right. Let's get out of here.
Yeah!
All right. Look, I just sit tight.
I'll be right back.
Car 74, arrived at the scene.
Olynek's here, we'll go in tandem.
What's going on in there?
We don't know.
So stay in the vehicle, got it?
So we think he's in there?
All right. We'll take the front.
All right.
Hands in the air!
Put your hands up!
Get down!
Hands back! Hands back now!
I'm with Mike! I'm with Mike!
Face down, do not move!
Hey! Hey! What the hell's going on?
Put that away!
Got your guy's accomplice here.
He's with me! He's my ride-along!
My foster son.
I just saw him and I thought...
yeah! I know what you thought.
Get up. You okay?
Look, I'm sorry, Foster.
I'm not the one you should be apologizing to.
Sorry.
You okay?
Yeah.
I told you to stay in the car.
No Sabia... what we were doing was ilegal.
We are inocente! Inocente!
Okay, what are we supposed to do?
"A show of respect?" What does that mean?
He says he wants respect.
Yeah ...
I think it's this kind of respect?
Oh, you're kidding.
That's all I got.
I spent the rest... how much do you have?
I don't have anything. You told me to bring car keys.
Wait. Wait.
No, no, no, it's okay. I wanted to show you something.
Here!
Top of the linea.
Usted no play the musica?
Ustedes vendes, get mucho dinero.
Brandon, you can't do this.
Do you have a better idea?
I think... I think I owe you an apology.
I...
I wasn't trying to shame you, Mariana, I wasn't.
But sex is a big deal.
Every time you have sex it's a big deal.
You're sharing a vulnerable and precious part of yourself.
You should always make sure you feel good about it.
Not that we're encouraging you to have sex at your age.
No, of course not.
You're young, and so are your brothers.
We give them condoms not to encourage them,
but to protect them because we know we can't control everything.
Try as we might.
Listen...
We just want you to love yourself as much as we love you.
And it doesn't seem like you love yourself too much right now.
That's why I broke up with Mat.
I can't tell him what I did.
What do I say to Callie?
She's gonna hate me.
Oh, my love. You know what?
We all do things that we wish we hadn't.
But we learn from them, and if we...
manage not to repeat them...
Man, it feels really, really good.
No, thank you. No! Thank you! Thanks!
What are we gonna tell moms?
I mean, by the time we get home, it's gonna be so late.
I'll buy you another keyboard.
It's not like I need it anyway.
You ever get the feeling like
the whole world is just conspiring against you?
Yeah. I'm pretty familiar with that concept.
Wait! What does that sign say?
We need passports?
I thought that we just needed our drive r's licenses.
Well, I guess you were wrong.
No, but when we came in to Mexico,
they just waved us through.
Maybe you should've done some research before you ...
No! Thank you! No! Thank you!
No, thank you, sir!
before you kidnapped me and dragged me into another country
for some stupid, illegal adventure.
Sure, sure. Nothing's ever your fault.
Oh, so, how is this on me?
Don't worry, it's not.
No, 'cause the whole universe is conspiring against you,
and you can just blame one of us "dramatic girls"
for ruining your life.
Truth is, things were a lot easier before you showed up.
Screw you, Brandon.
Callie!
Callie! Callie!
What're you gonna do, walk home from Mexico?
Or maybe you can just call your new boyfriend
to come pick you up, huh?
What are you talking about?
Just saying,
there is a new foster brother in the house.
There is nothing going on between me and A.J..
I'm not blind, Callie.
Actually, I think you are, Brandon.
Walking around thinking you're some victim?
Acting like the world is out to get you?
You don't see the drama that you create.
You were the one who turned up to Girls United
and got yourself a restraining order.
You were the one who started selling fake IDs
that got your hand crushed.
You were the one who plagiarized Bach
and then got kicked out of Idyllwild. Okay?
If you're really worried about the drama in your life, Brandon,
look at the common denominator, okay? It's you!
Can we just go back to the car?
Where is the car?
You want some dinner?
I'm pretty beat.
Maybe we should order in? What do you feel like?
Chinese?
Pizza?
Look, I know today was tough...
You don't know.
Okay.
Fair enough.
You wanna talk about it?
Why?
What you gotta say?
You gonna tell me how to talk to cops, huh?
My grandma already schooled me on that, all right?
"Hands on the steering wheel, never resist...
Yes, sir, no, sir."
"Let 'em look through whatever you got, and lie down like a dog
'cause you ain't no better than one."
Don't say that.
Why not?
It's the truth!
It's how a black man gets treated by the cops.
You should know.
I may be a cop, but I'm also your foster father.
No, you ain't.
Okay, well, I'm gonna be.
Why?
We both know this ain't gonna work.
Of course it is.
Why are you even doing this?
I'm trying to help you, A.J.!
You don't know how to help me, Mike!
You got no idea what it's like to be living down
to the low expectations society has for you.
"Foster kid?
Black kid?
Oh! You must be headed for gangs, drugs, jail."
I've been hearing it so long,
I'm starting to wonder if they're right.
They're not right, A.J.!
And you should stop listening to those people right now!
Except there's a lot more of them and only one of me.
Not anymore. Now there's two.
Right?
There's two of us. Come here!
And this cop...
sees a bright... talented, decent young man.
This cop's not gonna let you live down to anybody's expectations.
You understand me?
Come here!
All you need is someone who believes in you.
Someone you can count on and I'm gonna be that person.
You know why?
'Cause I have to believe in a world
where a kid like you gets a real chance.
That's why I'm doing this, A.J., okay?
You didn't mess up my life, Callie. I did.
It's just...
Easier to blame you for it.
And if I'm being honest,
I was kinda relieved that Idyllwild kicked me out.
If I could blame Kat,
then it wasn't my fault.
You know?
You think they'll give you another chance?
Doubt it.
And honestly, I don't wanna know the answer, either way.
When we were at the edge of that cliff...
That's how it felt every day at camp.
I was so close to something so huge...
Only I was too scared to do something about it.
Except today you jumped, Brandon.
You jumped.
What're we gonna say?
Passport?
Hello, officer.
So it looks like we did something really stupid.
Thank you.
Hola.
They made me tell!
Okay, we didn't mean to...
You know what? Don't start, Brandon.
It's my fault.
I kidnapped Brandon and took him to Mexico.
I just needed to get out of my head
and we ended up getting out of the country.
Why...why Mexico? What did you do?
We just chilled on the beach.
Nothing wild.
We even used sunscreen.
Oh, that's good.
Any drinking?
None. Promise.
Then how'd you get back into the country with no passports?
Played dumb.
That couldn't have been hard.
There will be consequences
that we talk about later, but right now...
Brandon, you have a visitor in the kitchen.
Sucks to be you, huh?
Look, if this is about what I said,
about... you and Kat...
setting me up, I'm sorry.
I really thought that...
Dude, I get it.
Kat could drive Gandhi to smack a baby... hard.
But that's not the reason I drove all the way down here.
How the hell do you make that drive every day, anyway?
Well, that's one good thing, I guess, I don't have to anymore.
Okay. What if I told you, you might?
See, I was talking to my pianist, Jin,
and I said what a raw deal I thought you got.
And he said... if you want...
he'd be willing to take you on.
So that means I'm back in?
Aw, hell!
Hey, Oscar.
Finished for the day? How'd it go?
Made some good progress.
Good.
All right. Well, we'll see you on Monday, yeah?
Uh... yes. Although there is one thing...
Yeah, what is it?
I have to ask if you can pay me now, in full.
Whoa, Oscar, wait a minute.
We have a deal...
A payment schedule. Why do you suddenly want...
Look, when couples break up,
it usually means I don't get paid
until the lawyers are all done.
What... Why're...
...you think Lena and I are breaking up?
Why would you...
Look, if you prefer,
we could talk about an escrow account.
Well, as much as it pains me to say it,
seems like Oscar got a lot of work done today.
Speaking of home repair,
I think, um... I think that you...
actually have a point.
I do?
Yeah. I was thinking that...
If you feel that...
that a third party would help us then, um...
