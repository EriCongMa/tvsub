growing up , my mom made every lunch bag
an ornate tapestry of her love for us .
each morning , she made it her top priority
to send us to school knowing that we meant the world to her .
and while none of her kids ever really appreciated
her expressions of affection ,
that didn &apos;t stop my mom from constantly declaring
how she adored us with every ounce of her soul .
i love you so much .
i love you , too .
i love you .
mom !
and the basketball pep rally is after lunch .
also , barry goldberg , your mother loves you .
you didn &apos;t say it with love .
barry , i love you .
i love you , boopie .
i love you so much .
hey , you , with the window open , tell my baby i love him !
adam , if you need to make , call me !
i &apos;ll pick you up !
my father , on the other hand , was not nearly as effusive .
why you got to be a moron all the time ?
don &apos;t be a moron . get your ass home .
you &apos;re a moron .
oh , yeah , my dad was miles from sentimental .
okay , i &apos;m heading off to prom .
erica , wait .
can you , uh , get me the remote ?
and no matter what we did ,
my dad was literally incapable of saying &quot; i love you . &quot;
great pass , bobby ! i love you , son !
bar ! hey , bar !
i want to beat the traffic !
catch a ride home with bobby !
he couldn &apos;t even say &quot; i love you &quot;
when erica was accepted into the governor &apos;s school ,
a prestigious summer music program .
but my mother more than made up for it .
and i &apos;m not saying other people don &apos;t love their children .
i &apos;m just saying i love mine way more than they love theirs .
so , to sum it all up ...
... mama hawk &apos;s gonna miss baby bird .
here , i bought you a going @-@ away present .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll look at it every night .
oh , good . a photo album .
not the leather jacket or boots i wanted .
and now your father would like to say a few heartfelt words .
uh , no , no , no , i &apos;m good .
your , uh , 20 @-@ minute speech covered all the bases .
speech !
tell your daughter how you feel .
this is gonna be so uncomfortable .
speech ! speech !
shut up , barry ! take the knife away from him .
erica , you &apos;re , uh , my first kid .
uh , could have been worse .
what he meant to say was that he loves you so much , baby .
but then my dad really opened his heart .
sure .
yeah , for him , that &apos;s as open as it gets .
it was may 13 , 1980 @-@ something ,
the day i &apos;d finally profess my love for my girlfriend ,
and nothing would stop me .
what the hell , dude ? ! those aren &apos;t for you .
hey , don &apos;t leave a basketball in front of michael jordan
and expect him not to dunk it .
from downtown !
idiot . can &apos;t you read ?
these are for dana .
i &apos;m finally gonna tell her i love her .
what ? !
isn &apos;t it great ?
he &apos;s telling his girl he loves her with baked goods .
you can &apos;t tell a girl you love her .
it ruins everything . trust me .
please don &apos;t trust him .
love is dangerous , and it can hurt people ,
like a ninja riding on a saber @-@ toothed tiger .
please don &apos;t trust him .
you can &apos;t just say it . it makes you look vulnerable .
and she &apos;ll lose all respect for you .
well , i @-@ i got to do something .
dana and her family are going away for the summer .
w @-@ what if she meets a guy while she &apos;s in seattle ?
why are you worried about some dude from canada ?
you just need to relax and maintain the upper hand .
i just ... don &apos;t want to lose her .
so this is what you do -- you march up to dana .
you gently cup her beautiful face in your hands ,
look deep into her brown eyes , and attack her one weakness ,
like , &quot; you got gremlin ears , girl . &quot;
don &apos;t do that .
do that !
don &apos;t do that .
do that ! it &apos;s your only choice !
give me these cupcakes .
no !
oh , god !
what ?
barry was a man of strong convictions .
unfortunately , he was never one to follow his own advice .
what do you mean , you got practice until 5 : 00 ?
you promised your man you &apos;d watch him do leg curls .
i really didn &apos;t , but i will drop by after .
i &apos;ll bring you one of those frozen burritos you like .
god , you so get me . i love you .
and in a moment of sheer stupidity ,
barry had accidently dropped the &quot; l &quot; bomb .
his only hope was that lainey didn &apos;t hear him .
what did you just say ?
but she did .
i said ...
you got gremlin ears , girl .
barry norman goldberg with the save .
while barry was denying he said the &quot; l &quot; word ,
my mom was livid that my dad couldn &apos;t .
okay . you &apos;re rage @-@ cleaning .
before you wipe a hole in the counter , tell me what i did .
why can &apos;t you just tell the kids you love them ?
you tell them 100 times a day .
how much love do these people need ?
i only say it so much to pick up your slack .
why do i got to say it out loud ?
i love bacon , but i never actually say it .
bacon just knows .
you always say you love bacon .
well , that is true .
but i tell the kids i love them every day
by putting a roof over their heads .
yeah ?
well , what gonna happen when erica leaves for the summer ?
where &apos;s your fancy love roof then ?
well , you &apos;ve got a point .
okay , bevy , i &apos;ll go do my thing .
and that thing was to go sit right in his chair ...
nope
.... and ignore my mom .
you really should go tell your daughter you love her .
you weren &apos;t in the room . how do you even know this ?
you basically yell everything you say .
and for the record , i completely agree with beverly .
i &apos;m not saying &quot; i love you . &quot;
my dad never said it to me , and i turned out fine .
no , you &apos;re the best .
why are you busting my chops ?
&quot; i love you &quot; isn &apos;t something a dad says .
here . watch me .
what are you doing ? why are you moving in on me ?
i love you , mur .
i love you , mur .
i love you , murray goldberg .
this is a nightmare .
while my dad was being forced to say &quot; i love you , &quot;
i was ready to open up my heart to dana .
long before texting , the only way
to profess your deepest feelings for a girl
was to pen an epic love letter
and cooly hand @-@ deliver it into her locker .
will you just stop ? you &apos;ve been dodging me for two days .
it &apos;s only been two days ?
feels like i &apos;ve been dodging you for a week .
ohh ! why did you have to say &quot; i love you &quot; ?
it &apos;s no big deal . i say it all the time .
watch . i love you , dan !
oh , love you , too , bro .
see ? means nothing .
okay , if anything , you need to stop reading into things .
it &apos;s not like i said
&quot; i love you more than anything in the world &quot;
or that you &apos;re my moon and my sun
and &quot; if you want to get married right now ,
i &apos;d run away and never see my family again . &quot;
i never said any of those things , so get over yourself .
i have practice , okay ? i got to go .
barry was right .
saying &quot; i love you &quot; ruined everything .
lucky for me , i wrote it down and could easily take it back .
or so i thought .
no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no .
there you are .
third @-@ period bell just rang .
then you should go .
but i got to get my homework .
it &apos;s more important to be on time
than to have your homework , am i right ?
move it , move it . - no --
while i was trying to keep dana from knowing i loved her ,
my dad went to erica to finally say it .
you , uh , seem surprised to see me here .
well , you usually don &apos;t make it this far down the hallway .
yeah , well , it &apos;s really not on the way to anything .
so , what do you want ?
i , um ...
was just thinking that , um , you know ,
you &apos;re going away for the summer and all , and ...
you know , i don &apos;t really say it much .
i , um ...
what &apos;s happening ?
you know , i just wanted to say ...
i love you .
what ?
i luh you .
what ?
i luh you .
what ?
you heard me .
i really didn &apos;t .
i &apos;m just saying ... oh , god .
... that i , uh ...
love you .
are you sick or something ?
no .
did you gamble away my college fund ?
that &apos;s nuts . where did you get that from ?
well , i know you and mom aren &apos;t getting divorced
because your survival depends on her .
so what is this ? you &apos;re freaking me out .
it &apos;s nothing , damn it !
i just wanted to say &quot; i love you &quot; !
okay . um ... thanks ?
so , t @-@ that &apos;s it , huh ? is that it ?
okay , all right .
s @-@ so i guess i &apos;ll -- i &apos;ll be on my way .
well , i said the thing to the girl .
we can all get on with our lives .
oh , come on . i want details .
she didn &apos;t say it back .
they always say it back .
not in this case .
maybe you didn &apos;t say it right .
i want a do @-@ over , murray . go back up and try again .
no do @-@ overs !
i &apos;m never saying those words again .
don &apos;t say that just &apos; cause your feelings are hurt .
my feelings aren &apos;t hurt .
i just discovered that i &apos;m not my daughter &apos;s cup of tea .
that would honestly rock me to the core .
yeah , well , you know .
i mean that &apos;s a rejection of you
both as a father and a human being .
it &apos;s fine .
you &apos;d think she &apos;d say it just to be polite .
okay , it stings a little . this is your fault .
you set me up .
that was my first and last &quot; i love you &quot; ever !
it was third period , and i was running out of time
to rescue my love letter from dana &apos;s locker .
damn it !
what am i even listening for ? the movies lied .
out of options , there was only one logical choice left --
pull the fire alarm .
sure , it was a serious crime .
but as long as i played it cool and acted quick ,
no one would be the wiser .
goldfarb !
my office ! now !
son , i &apos;ve been here a long time ,
and i &apos;ve seen a lot of kids pull that fire alarm
for a lot of different reasons .
what &apos;s yours ?
pop quiz in chemistry ?
no .
arousing daydream ?
no !
had a fart that fooled you ?
worse .
ooh . i &apos;m intrigued .
i have an awesome girlfriend , and i wrote her a letter --
ka @-@ boom .
the problem is
i stupidly signed the letter &quot; i love you , &quot; and now --
now you &apos;re out on a ledge , exposed ,
with a giant target on your heart .
there are no more dangerous words than &quot; i love you . &quot;
wow . yeah .
just &apos; cause i wear the same tiny shorts every day
doesn &apos;t mean i don &apos;t wear many hats .
coach knows love good .
i even played the russian mail @-@ order game ,
and i did not win .
let &apos;s just say ,
it was an express to sad town .
coach ! coach ! i need your help .
what are you doing ? ! he &apos;s helping me right now .
go away ! i actually got real adult problems .
i want to be a cheerleader .
we &apos;ve all been there . why ?
my lady . she &apos;s been pushing me away .
but you know the saying -- if you love someone ,
you become a male cheerleader and trap them into loving you .
dang . you goldbergs feel hard .
you leave it all on the field , just like coach .
well , don &apos;t worry . i can help you both .
you can help me get my letter back ?
you got it .
and i can be a cheerleading man ?
oh , no . no , god , no .
i got one position open , if you got the nards .
i &apos;m looking for a brave soul to be the team mascot .
well , my soul &apos;s the bravest , coach .
while barry would do anything to stay close to lainey ,
my mom was furious with erica for pushing my dad away .
mom , stop rage @-@ juicing .
if you want to talk , i &apos;m right here .
how could you ?
i &apos;ve done some questionable things lately ,
so if you could just say out loud what i did first ,
just so we &apos;re all on the same page .
your father said &quot; i love you , &quot; and you didn &apos;t say it back .
yes . that is definitely the worst thing i &apos;ve done this week .
why can &apos;t you just say it back to him ?
you have no problem saying &quot; i love you &quot; to me .
that &apos;s because you say it so much , it &apos;s meaningless .
i &apos;m on autopilot .
it &apos;s like saying &quot; god bless you &quot; after someone sneezes .
it was a disaster when he said it ,
and i &apos;m not gonna make it worse .
what if i make it worth your while ?
wait , are you trying to bribe me ?
please , you wouldn &apos;t believe what it would take
to get me to do this .
i &apos;m not saying no .
i &apos;m just saying come in high with your offer .
is that a new jacket ?
it is . i love you , dad .
turns out the price of love is $ 57 plus tax .
oh , god ! she &apos;s opening up her locker !
quick , pull the fire alarm .
come on , goldberg .
pulling the fire alarm is morally reprehensible .
all right , people , impromptu drug search !
open your lockers !
think we &apos;ll start over here .
i &apos;m searching your locker , caldwell .
me ? why ?
well , let &apos;s just say i got it on good authority
there &apos;s a buttload of ludes in there .
what &apos;s a lude ?
don &apos;t play coy with me .
i know a lude @-@ head when i see one .
all right , let &apos;s see here .
okay , search is over , people !
let &apos;s go ! asses to classes !
stay clean , caldwell .
even though coach mellor saved me
from making the biggest mistake of my life ,
nothing could save barry from this debacle .
while my brother considered himself an expert at many things ,
the fine art of mascot @-@ ing was not one of them .
turns out the only thing creepier
than barry spying on his girlfriend
was the 10 @-@ pound , dead @-@ eyed , grinning quaker
strapped to his head .
hey ! what are you -- back off !
chill !
surprise ! it &apos;s barry !
oh , my god . what are you doing ?
i &apos;m the fighting quaker !
i thought dressing in a giant , rubber donald sutherland head
would be the perfect way of making things less weird between us .
this makes things so much weirder .
please , just go .
only if you say &quot; i love you &quot; back so it makes things even .
go on .
tell me you love me .
my eyes are in my mouth , so say it right here .
i &apos;m sorry , barry . i &apos;m not gonna say it .
ouch .
she doesn &apos;t love you , bro .
off , lyle and kyle .
easy !
i will throw you , bro , and not in a cheerleading way .
all right , bring it in !
cheerleaders and mascot , too .
big away game at central high tonight .
heated rivalry , big stakes .
that means some of you are going to get hurt .
sprained ankles , jammed fingers ,
not to mention guaranteed off @-@ the @-@ court attacks
on some of our support personnel .
i &apos;m sorry . what , now ?
i thought you knew about this .
last year , some of our more passionate fans
laid a swift beatdown on their mascot ,
bobby the beaver .
tonight , revenge hangs like a thick fog over the entire squad ,
although some of us might be wearing cumbersome ,
vision @-@ hindering costumes ,
which will make us even more of a target than the others .
uh , coach ?
yes ? our brave , doomed quaker has a question .
i know you &apos;re giving us a general pep talk and all ,
but it feels directed mostly toward me .
oh , my god , barry . take off the stupid costume .
they &apos;re gonna break every bone in your body .
my heart bone &apos;s already been broken , girl .
that &apos;s the spirit . give barry a hug before you go .
it may be some time before you get a chance to do it again .
not a good time , dan .
even though my mom bribed erica to say &quot; i love you , &quot;
she was so giddy with the results that she doubled down .
dad ! there &apos;s my guy !
just wanted to say i love you .
i love you so much .
she really does .
what the hell &apos;s going on with you two ?
nothing . i just love you , man .
did you put her up to this ? first the jacket , now new boots ?
are you buying her leather goods
so she &apos;ll say &quot; i love you &quot; to me ?
guilty !
come on .
i am guilty . yes .
stop pulling strings , dad ! i love you . just drop it .
well , i don &apos;t accept it .
what ? you can &apos;t reject my love .
oh , i reject it . i reject it but good .
take it . take the &quot; i love you . &quot;
just take it , murray . it &apos;s love . take it .
no . she &apos;s using it as a weapon .
i love you ! !
see ? it stings doesn &apos;t it ?
oh , you want it to sting ?
i love you ! take that .
is that all you got ? i love you !
i love you so much ! eat it !
i love you more ! boom ! in your face !
shut your mouth , &apos; cause i love you more !
i love you to infinity !
i love you !
my love knows no bounds all the way to infinity !
while my dad and erica were using love as a weapon ,
my brother was at our rival high school
with a target on his back .
the fighting quaker didn &apos;t have a fighting chance .
kill the quaker !
kill the quaker !
oh , my god ! barry , that &apos;s you !
you &apos;re the one they &apos;re gonna kill .
dude , just hide on the bus . that &apos;s what i do .
a sane man would have listened , but my bro was anything but sane .
no ! no hiding !
i &apos;m gonna go out there !
it &apos;s the least i can do after you all took me
into your cheerleading family , especially you , lyle .
not you , kyle . you suck .
point is , it &apos;s been quite a ride , cheerleaders ,
but the ride ends now .
barry , wait . barry , don &apos;t do this .
why do you even care ?
&apos;cause i love you , okay ? god .
you &apos;re just saying that &apos; cause you don &apos;t want me to die .
of course i don &apos;t want you to die .
but ... i really do love you .
then why didn &apos;t you say it back ?
i was scared , okay ?
when my mom left , it crushed my dad ,
so i swore i &apos;d never be so dumb to fall in love myself .
but ... you &apos;re just so dumb ,
you made me fall in love with you anyway .
so ... you really love me ?
wait , you &apos;re still going out there ?
you bet i am .
i &apos;m as strong as all the oceans ,
as powerful as a really big magnet .
as awesome as a thundercat !
&apos;cause lainey lewis loves barry goldberg !
tt was a moment my brother would hold onto forever .
the girl of his dreams loved him back ,
and nothing could hurt him now .
well , nothing except a vengeful mob of angry fans .
but as i watched my brother single @-@ handedly battle ...
an entire high school , i realized
that with love on your side , you can take on anything .
sure , there &apos;s nothing more dangerous or scary
than putting your heart on the line .
but as i raced into the night ,
i knew that love was a risk worth taking .
adam .
dana . i ...
what ? what &apos;s wrong ?
i wrote you this whole thing
&apos;cause i was so scared to say it out loud .
i &apos;m not scared anymore .
dana , i love you .
i love you .
i ...
... love you , too .
and that &apos;s what makes all this so hard .
i just ... didn &apos;t know how to tell you .
tell me what ?
we &apos;re not going to seattle just for the summer .
my dad got offered a job there , so ...
we &apos;re gonna see if we like it .
but you can &apos;t just leave .
here .
my green lantern ring ?
hopefully , i &apos;m there on the first day of school
and you can give it back to me .
goodbye , adam .
that &apos;s the thing about young love .
as magical as it is , it &apos;s just as unpredictable .
doing some rage @-@ packing , huh ?
well , wonder where i get it from .
shmoopie , i can &apos;t let you leave things this way with your father .
we were totally fine before you broke us .
no , i get it now .
just &apos; cause i say &quot; i love you &quot; all the time
doesn &apos;t mean you have to .
i just ... wanted both of you to know
how you feel about each other .
he &apos;s my dad . i love him more than anything .
trust me , he knows .
and she was right . he really did .
even though erica and my dad
were never able to actually say the words ,
they didn &apos;t have to .
&apos;cause when it comes to family ,
you know in your heart how they feel ...
i love you , i love you , i love you .
... and you carry that love with you no matter how far you go .
so ...
so ...
uh , have a nice summer , peanut .
and , uh ...
i know , dad . me too .
you okay ?
okay , come on . i &apos;m sorry .
looking back on your childhood is a funny thing .
sure , the details get fuzzy , and the days blend together .
but the good news is all the hurt fades away ,
and you just end up remembering the love .
you remember your family . you remember 1980 @-@ something .
and you wouldn &apos;t change a thing .
our family &apos;s here . ha ! come on and see our family .
i love you . oh , geez .
i love you .
i love you . i love you .
fight , fight , fight , fight , fight !
we gather here today to witness the burial of optimus prime .
yeah , kiddo !
barry , that was amazing .
what &apos;s up ? who &apos;s this ?
we assumed is you .
