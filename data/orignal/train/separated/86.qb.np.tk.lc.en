... and an additional 36.1 .
the chumhum retainer of $ 54.6 million ,
no risk collar , minus the $ 12.2 million payout ,
we are now completely debt free .
what a difference a month makes .
now , expected revenues .
given the $ 54.6 million ,
the $ 42.6 million from mr. bishop ,
and the strangely profitable mr. sweeney ,
at $ 45.3 million ,
we are on track to end the year ...
$ 133 million in the black .
$ 133 million ?
yes , it was our best quarter ever .
we were so worried about reducing overhead ,
we suddenly made ourselves very , very profitable .
we held together through thick and thin .
now it &apos;s time to celebrate the thick .
what about those new guys ?
what about the new partners ,
these five new guys ?
five offers were given to associates
in order to inflate our ranks .
it is our feeling that that move was premature .
just to be clear , we already made those offers .
we have talked to the five associates involved .
well , that was before we had money .
have those five associates
submitted their capital contribution ?
no , but they are in the process .
unfortunately , we all voted on this
at our last meeting .
well , i say let &apos;s vote again , hmm ?
i &apos;m not about to give up five percent of my yearly nut
to these guys who did nothing .
all those in favor of delaying partnership offers ,
please raise your hands .
yes , that &apos;s right , keep them up , keep them up .
you &apos;re not hearing us .
we &apos;re not going over $ 800,000 .
our client did nothing wrong ,
his product is perfectly safe .
your client misused his product .
no , my client lost her 16 @-@ year @-@ old granddaughter .
and if you want to try to win your case by blaming her ...
then i &apos;d love to see you try .
we &apos;ll see you in court .
we have a good case .
he has nothing but emotion .
we &apos;ll win in court .
it &apos;s the jury system , it &apos;s a flip of the coin .
i don &apos;t like flips of the coin .
it &apos;s either that or pay $ 14 million .
times seven . there are seven other deaths out there .
i want certainty .
what kind of certainty ?
a war game .
we &apos;re going to be rich , alicia .
no ...
yes , we are .
profit participants in the firm just came into chumhum .
look , once you start getting yacht brochures in the mail ,
that &apos;s when you know you &apos;re coming into money .
how do they even know to send that to you ?
capitalism , it just knows .
cary , alicia , do you have a minute ?
yeah , sure , what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing . we have something to discuss .
do you know the , um , thief drink case ?
the power drink ? yeah .
well , thief corporation is being sued
by the grandparents of a young girl who died after drinking it .
yeah , we know .
we can &apos;t get the defendant to accept a fair offer .
they want to go to court .
now , we want to go to court , too ,
but the client wants to test @-@ run the case first .
they have given us $ 100,000 to run this case through a mock trial .
so , you want us to second chair it ?
no , we want you to play red team .
you want us to oppose you ?
yes . represent that plaintiff . we &apos;ll represent thief .
the thief ceo wants to see how the case goes
before he pulls the trigger on a real trial .
that sounds ... fun .
it could be .
here are the case files .
from this moment on , we won &apos;t discuss the case .
you prepare , we prepare ,
and we &apos;ll see how it goes in mock trial tomorrow .
what about our witnesses ?
here &apos;s a list of the expert witnesses we passed on .
you can hire one of them .
and you can hire an actor to play the plaintiff .
so , how easy should we go on you ?
well , this doesn &apos;t work unless you give it your all .
the client will know if you &apos;re going at half @-@ speed ,
so come at us hard .
okay . be prepared to lose .
we &apos;ll see you in court .
they &apos;ve been preparing their case for three months now ,
and we have , what , 24 hours ?
yeah , that &apos;s fair .
so , that leaves us the element of surprise .
have you ever played your boss in tennis ?
whatever they say , they don &apos;t want to lose .
the difference is , we &apos;re partners .
they &apos;re not our bosses anymore .
so , the red team .
we &apos;re having team t @-@ shirts made up .
kalinda , what do you have on prior cases brought against thief ?
we can &apos;t find anything in the database .
yeah , that makes sense .
can you look ?
no .
no ?
what do you mean , no ?
well , you represent the plaintiff .
you don &apos;t work for the firm .
oh , come on .
is this from will ?
well , lockhart / gardner is the blue team ,
and i work for lockhart / gardner .
sorry .
wait , wait , wait , wait .
we &apos;ll hire you .
with what ?
we have a budget of $ 10,000 to hire expert witnesses .
okay ...
$ 400 an hour .
oh , come on .
how much for friends ?
$ 400 an hour .
we need her .
we &apos;ll go for the cheapest expert .
okay .
let us know when you exceed 20 hours .
okay .
good doing business with you two .
mr. gold .
hello . how are you ?
fine . how are you ?
i &apos;m good . thanks for asking .
uh , this way .
i showed them into the conference room .
two very nice men from the department of justice .
i know lots of campaign managers who offer discounts
for their services .
even the prosecutor , wendy scott @-@ carr , did .
oh , yes , she &apos;s been replaced .
what ?
she &apos;s not on the case anymore .
i think they realized &quot; unclean hands . &quot;
okay , they &apos;re in here .
okay , let &apos;s see .
could you try the ones on that side ?
okay .
ah , we thought we &apos;d lost you .
it &apos;s a jungle out here .
this is my client , eli gold ,
and this is josh perrotti .
hello .
and you remember agent laguardia ?
of course . mr. gold and i shared our love
for the ivories .
the accordion .
the accordion ?
i play the accordion .
i didn &apos;t know that .
since when ?
six months .
polka runs in the family .
&quot; polka runs in the family . &quot;
that &apos;s funny .
now , i &apos;ve asked eli not to say anything ,
so he &apos;s not being rude here ,
he &apos;s just following my directive .
good .
i &apos;ve been sent up from d.c. for one reason :
seems i &apos;m the only man in chicago without bias .
i believe in laying out our evidence . so , david ...
this is a wiretap from september 28 of last year .
so , how much are we talking , eli ?
uh , the usual this month .
and , uh , if i &apos;m effective ,
next month we can discuss .
did you get my e @-@ mail ?
i did . i &apos;m talking to her tomorrow .
she &apos;s really your ex @-@ wife ?
oh , this is greg leshoure ,
of wooster @-@ graff industries .
she &apos;ll make a great senator . she just needs ...
a bit of financial boost .
unfortunately , that &apos;s you committing a felony ,
mr. gold .
dollars for donations .
we do have an offer for you .
eli wears a wire and gets
peter florrick admitting
to a recent accepted bribe ...
he never accepted a brib
... and we drop all charges against you .
go to hell .
okay ,
we don &apos;t need to go down the tough @-@ boy route .
we just wanted to lay out our evidence
and show you all our moves .
it &apos;s most welcome .
and i &apos;m sure you wouldn &apos;t mind sending me a copy
of the wiretap complaint application
for interception of telephonic communications :
18 usc.2518.
i &apos;ll send it right over .
good morning .
thank you for participating in
t &amp; r legal research &apos;s mock trial .
you &apos;re our jury . welcome .
the issues here are real .
the lawyers are real .
the judges rulings are real .
even the room is real ,
and , of course , you are real .
so , i &apos;m sure you &apos;ve noticed the cameras over your head
and placed strategically throughout this courtroom .
just ignore them .
they are recording your responses
for later analysis .
and , uh , we &apos;ll be checking in with you
now and then to get a sense of how the trial is going .
okay . so , without further ado ,
i won &apos;t tell you anything about the case .
i will leave that to them .
plaintiff &apos;s lawyers ready for their opening statements ?
yes , your honor .
let &apos;s go .
this is the drink that killed our client .
it &apos;s called thief .
it contains 240 milligrams of caffeine .
that is the equivalent of 12 cups of coffee .
it also contains 200 milligrams of guarana ,
one of the highest caffeine containing plants in the world .
now , you may have seen this drink on the store shelves .
you may not have bought it ,
because this is how it &apos;s advertised .
this is your brain on reality .
this is your brain on thief .
it &apos;s advertised to kids .
this is the kid who thief advertised to .
bella ward .
they &apos;re in take @-@ no @-@ prisoners mode .
16 years old .
she died last year .
she suffered from a massive seizure , caffeine toxicity .
where did they get those pictures ?
facebook .
now , i know the opposition here .
i know will gardner . he &apos;s a good lawyer .
yes , he is .
and i know what he &apos;s going to tell you .
he is going to blame the victim .
he is going to say that this 16 @-@ year @-@ old
should &apos;ve known better .
that bella caused her own death .
then , he &apos;s going to blame the grandparents .
it &apos;s unclear how both principles could be true ,
but all he has to do is tarnish one of them to make it work .
so ...
i ask one thing of you :
don &apos;t be fooled .
you wouldn &apos;t let a crime victim be blamed .
bella , in many ways , is a crime victim .
the only difference here is the assailant ,
and the assailant here is thief .
they advertised their drink to her ,
and then they killed her .
they need to be held accountable
or they will do the same to your kids .
thank you .
nice work .
thank you .
well , that &apos;s an odd experience .
someone making me the subject of their opening argument .
game on .
david , how are you ?
i &apos;m good .
unfortunately , we have a problem .
oh , no , we have an opportunity .
ha ! that &apos;s right .
every problem is an opportunity .
well , here &apos;s the opportunity :
we need to delay your partnership for a year .
the equity partners are not withdrawing the offer of partnership ,
we just have to delay it .
why ?
we ... need time to assess the repercussions
of changes in the workplace .
and how long will that take ?
how long will it take to assess the changes ? we &apos;re not sure .
the equity partners will review at the next meeting .
thanks for understanding .
david ?
what just happened ?
nothing .
we &apos;re a democratic institution , and unfortunately ,
democratic institutions change their minds .
what was that ?
i think i was just mugged .
yes , but it &apos;s not ...
those proportions would suggest your conclusion .
so in your expert opinion ,
dr. borgnine , how did bella die ?
a seizure due to caffeine toxicity
which caused her to aspirate emesis into her lungs .
in simpler terms ?
she choked on her own vomit .
and this was caused by this drink ?
yes .
i know it looks innocuous , but it &apos;s not .
it killed her .
thank you , doctor .
your witness .
uh , this is bella ,
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old who died ,
but this is bella , too ,
in a photo we weren &apos;t aware of until
the plaintiff presented it in court this morning .
doctor , can you tell the difference between these two ...
objection , your honor . vague .
yeah , um ... i &apos;ll allow .
could i have a ruling on that ?
i already ruled .
no , i &apos;m sorry , your honor , you didn &apos;t .
overruled .
go ahead and answer .
do i see a difference between these two photos ?
well , in that one she looks thinner .
uh , yes , at her death she weighed 85 pounds , five @-@ foot @-@ six .
does this suggest she was anorexic ?
yes . those proportions would suggest your conclusion .
and has anorexia ever resulted in a seizure ?
yes .
so is there any way to categorically
blame thief for bella &apos;s seizure ?
no , not if the victim had contributory causes .
i @-@ i tried to wake her up ,
but she was just lying there
so helpless , so tired .
bella ,
if i could just hold you one more time .
i could do that . no problem .
you sure ?
we don &apos;t want her to be too maudlin .
no , i don &apos;t do maudlin .
you saw my notices .
okay .
is this under sag or aftra ?
actor &apos;s equity , okay ?
cary ?
did david lee talk to you ?
yeah . did he talk to you ?
he said they were delaying my partnership .
they say until next year , but ...
same with me .
and the other fourth years ?
my guess is the same .
it &apos;s because of money , isn &apos;t it ?
they don &apos;t want to share the wealth .
they were fine sharing the debts ,
but never the wealth .
what do you want to do ?
what do you want to do ?
i think we should get the fourth years together
and discuss our options .
partners might be unhappy with that .
i know .
eli ? there &apos;s a weird lady here to see you .
elsbeth , come on in .
we have debate negotiations with maddie .
i think i better take them .
no , we &apos;ll need to delay them .
this is our second delay .
hello .
hi .
delay them an hour .
okay . nice meeting you .
and you . an exciting office .
so , they sent over the wiretap complaint application ,
but it checked out .
so i asked them to send over the underlying notes
used to prep the judge , but that checked out also .
so i ... can i set this here ?
yes , please .
so ?
well ,
then i asked them to send over the evidentiary notes .
those are proofs used to show the judge
there was enough reason to wiretap ,
and look here .
what is it ?
the department of justice requires three dirty calls
to warrant a wiretap .
&quot; dirty calls &quot; ?
you talking on an already existing wiretap .
that &apos;s a dirty call ,
and look here .
two dirty calls .
they changed it when they took it to the judge .
see ?
two here , two , three .
yes .
but this is the primary source , the one that says two .
it trumps all the other sources .
so they didn &apos;t have enough calls to warrant the wiretap .
yes , which means we can get it thrown out .
elsbeth , you ...
always bring cheer to my office .
oh , that &apos;s sweet .
and bella was your only grandchild ?
i &apos;m sorry .
i @-@ i miss her so much .
yes . she &apos;s my only one .
my @-@ my heart is missing a piece of itself .
i cry into the night ,
&quot; where are you , my bella ?
&quot; oh , lord , why ?
why is she gone from my arms ? &quot;
i see , i see .
and you were the one who discovered her body ?
yes . it was me .
i held her close to me , so close ,
and she felt cold .
cold as the grave . cold as the night .
please , baby , please don &apos;t go .
please , lord , don &apos;t take her .
oh , sweet heavenly father !
thank you for seeing me .
i just wanted to bring one small thing to your attention ,
if you have some time .
i always have time for you , elsbeth .
oh , would you like a biscotti ?
why , yes , i would .
i love biscotti .
thank you .
here &apos;s the problem for you , josh .
the number of dirty calls .
you need ... do you remember how many ?
three .
right , for an application ,
and yet , look here .
two ...
on david laguardia &apos;s evidentiary notes , see ?
could i see that ?
yes .
mr. perrotti , that ...
you can &apos;t do that .
i did it .
it was a mistake , that &apos;s all . i corrected it .
yes , but i ...
that was just a copy .
yes , could you bring me the other copies you have ?
are you serious ?
i needed three dirty calls for a wiretap .
i got a wiretap , so i must have had three dirty calls .
well , i &apos;ll bring my copy to court .
that &apos;ll be proof enough .
uh , no . because ...
here is the original ,
and just change the two to three .
wow .
yeah .
i &apos;ll beat you , mr. perrotti .
no , there &apos;s no record of me doing it .
it &apos;s over .
i &apos;m a lot like you , elsbeth ,
but i &apos;m sitting on this side of the desk .
this side of the desk wins .
not this time .
you &apos;re great .
i hope you &apos;ll have dinner with me when this is over .
yeah , i &apos;m gonna go now .
find a way to beat you .
do you have any more witnesses ?
yes , your honor .
we call arthur schumacher , thief vp of marketing .
uh , your honor , objection .
this name was not on the plaintiff &apos;s witness list .
it was on the defendant &apos;s witness list , your honor .
we &apos;re calling him as a hostile witness .
is he here anyway ?
yes , i believe he &apos;s in the observation room .
mr. schumacher ,
are you here ?
can we move this along , please ?
what is this , mr. schumacher ?
thief light .
and &quot; light &quot; as in ...
no calories ?
well , zero carbs and zero sugar .
so it &apos;s advertised as a diet drink ?
no , as a low @-@ cal energy supplement .
and have you seen this web site before ?
you see that there , &quot; gorgeously thin &quot; ?
yes , i &apos;ve heard of it .
it &apos;s a pro @-@ ana web site , isn &apos;t it ?
objection . relevance ?
yeah , i @-@ i don &apos;t get it .
what is that ?
pro @-@ ana ?
it &apos;s a site intended to promote anorexia .
all right , go ahead .
do you see this posting ?
&quot; so i weighed myself ,
&quot; and i &apos;m down 1.5 pounds . yay .
&quot; have lots of energy , too .
&quot; trying new power drink , thief light . &quot;
signed , &quot; girl @-@ in @-@ jeans45 . &quot;
yeah , i can see it .
tell me what a cyber shill is , mr. schumacher .
damn it .
it &apos;s perfectly legal .
yes , i know .
but what is a cyber shill ?
a freelance worker who helps promote products
by posting laudatory comments on web sites .
thank you .
we were able to trace this laudatory-- good word--
posting through its ip address to your cyber shill .
is girl @-@ in @-@ jeans45 one of your freelance workers ?
well , just to be clear , she posts on hundreds of sites .
um , we &apos;re not targeting , what is , pro @-@ ana sites .
and do you know how many time girl @-@ in @-@ jeans45
posted on gorgeously thin ?
well , as i just said , right , she &apos;s a freelance worker .
i don &apos;t control her .
135 times ,
most of the time promoting thief light .
yeah , that &apos;s not illegal .
yes , but it &apos;s also true that you &apos;re targeting anorexics .
no , dieters .
and if thief is targeting dieters ,
or anorexics ,
then it doesn &apos;t matter that bella was anorexic .
thief is just as liable for bella &apos;s death .
objection . counselor is testifying .
no further questions , your honor .
all right , as i promised ,
i &apos;ll be checking in with you now and then .
so if i could just see by show of hands ,
who do we think is winning right now ?
the lawyers representing the girl who died ?
okay .
what i can &apos;t understand is how you could be losing .
it &apos;s the plaintiff &apos;s case .
we haven &apos;t presented our defense .
this is what you should expect .
no , it &apos;s not what i expect .
i expect you to use every second to defend ...
... damages that we might award ? yeah .
what would i give the girl &apos;s family at this point ?
i don &apos;t know , maybe $ 45 million .
okay , i see a lot of heads nodding .
how many agree with that ?
are you losing this on purpose ?
what ?
do you want me to negotiate ?
it &apos;ll save you time in court .
sir , give us a chance to present our case ,
and don &apos;t judge until you hear it all .
they had the element of surprise .
now it &apos;s our turn .
can you tell what they &apos;re talking about ?
something about work .
is she getting fired ?
no .
here , go get something from the fridge .
figure it out .
it &apos;s about money .
it &apos;s always about money with them .
i worked for 30 hours on bishop .
we &apos;re the ones doing all the work .
look , they said they &apos;re just delaying our partnerships , all right ?
they &apos;re not gonna go back on their word .
i say we just sit tight and wait and see what happens .
we &apos;re doing the work , - they &apos;re getting the bonuses .
no , that doesn &apos;t make any sense .
wait , wait , wait .
they &apos;re making this about class warfare .
so what do we do ?
strike .
how about a slow down ?
no , that would just hurt the clients , not them .
all right . this is what i say we do :
this week we meet with all our top clients .
arrange lunches , drinks , meetings .
to do what ?
to scare the partners .
right . but don &apos;t say anything
to the partners about these meetings .
they &apos;ll hear about it from our top clients anyway .
and what do we do at these meetings ?
meet .
don &apos;t talk about forming a new firm ,
don &apos;t talk about jumping ship ,
just ask them if they &apos;re happy . that &apos;s all .
we can &apos;t be accused of doing anything wrong .
we &apos;re just seeing if our clients are happy .
right . but it will scare the hell out of the partners .
it &apos;ll make them think we &apos;re jumping ship
and taking all our top clients with us .
so what was that about ?
you guys are quitting ?
no . plotting .
why ?
because we want attention from our bosses .
why ?
because they &apos;re taking us for granted ,
and we want them not to .
just don &apos;t get fired , okay , mom ?
okay .
we should do it , alicia .
start our own firm .
cary .
what ?
you bring bishop , i bring chumhum .
suddenly we &apos;re the eighth largest firm in chicago .
you don &apos;t think those two would come with us ?
no , actually , i do think they would .
then let &apos;s do it .
we say yes tonight ,
next week we &apos;re the eighth largest firm .
and you &apos;re the wife of the governor .
and money ?
you need start @-@ up money , or ...
those clients don &apos;t even consider coming .
what did you have to borrow
to get your capital contribution together ?
a few hundred thousand ?
put that together , that &apos;s a million between us ,
that &apos;s start @-@ up money .
come on .
i &apos;m sick of waiting on other people .
having them control our fates .
it &apos;s no better on our own .
i mean , you &apos;re still controlled by the landlord , the clients .
look at will and diane , they &apos;re not free .
they &apos;re freer than us .
waiting to see if we have to kiss partnership butt
for the next four years ? come on .
florrick , agos &amp; associates .
look at that , i just gave you first billing .
i &apos;ll think about it .
we can change the world .
as the general counsel of thief ,
could you tell us how this beverage came to market ?
thief has gone through the most intensive ,
two @-@ year fda process of approval .
and do you believe that thief is safe ?
oh , it &apos;s more than safe .
it has adhered to the highest standards of safety .
thank you . no further questions .
mr. jaffer .
you spoke of the fda &apos;s approval process .
was the approval of thief as a food ,
or as a dietary supplement ?
i don &apos;t understand .
did the fda apply their food standards to thief ?
oh . i see .
no .
no , they , uh , considered it a supplement .
i see . so there were no standards for thief to meet .
the fda applies standards to food .
well , uh ...
it doesn &apos;t apply it to supplements ,
is that correct ?
more or less .
in what way less ?
excuse me ?
you just said , &quot; more or less . &quot;
in what way was i less right ?
um ... i &apos;m sorry .
you &apos;re actually right .
um ... it was a figure of speech .
okay .
so now according to your own records ,
you submitted thief to the fda more than once
over this two @-@ year process .
why did you submit it twice ?
that &apos;s not unusual .
yes , but the first time you submitted it as a food .
is that correct ?
yes .
then you added one ingredient to the beverage ?
didn &apos;t you ?
here &apos;s the list of ingredients both times you submitted .
you see that there ?
yeah . okay .
i see . looks like , uh ... like b12 .
that &apos;s correct . and once you added b12,
that allowed you to claim the beverage was a dietary supplement
and therefore not subject to stringent fda approval .
i would reject that characterization of our motives .
in fact , isn &apos;t thief identical to rockstar ,
an energy drink which recently was sent
an fda warning letter for adding ginkgo ?
i don &apos;t know anything about that .
and the only reason you weren &apos;t sent an identical warning letter
is because you gamed the system ,
so you are not considered a food .
objection , your honor .
prejudicial .
how is that prejudicial ?
because you &apos;re suggesting that thief should
be judged as a food when it &apos;s not a food .
yes , because they gamed the system .
no . it &apos;s about categories .
the fda has concluded thief is not a food .
wait a minute . the fda didn &apos;t conclude any such thing .
your honor , which counsel is questioning ?
wait , wait , hold it .
quiet , please .
i &apos;m gonna side with the defense on this .
what ?
i said i &apos;m gonna side with the defense on this ,
because your argument is prejudicial .
it is not .
will you sit down ?
i said his argument is prejudicial .
there is nothing prejudicial about pointing out
the hypocrisy of an fda manipulation .
quiet , the two of you .
keep yelling like this ,
you &apos;re going to find yourselves in contempt .
what , and end up in mock court jail ?
i need a bathroom break .
then we &apos;ll settle this .
watch it , you two .
or what ?
we don &apos;t get partnership ?
wait .
i had nothing to do with that decision .
i wasn &apos;t even in the meeting .
good to know .
alicia .
you think the name partners control everything ?
we &apos;re as much subject to the equity partners
as you and cary .
they can outvote us .
jordan !
hey , you need my help ?
what did you do ? what is this ?
i have no idea . you need to be more specific .
you agreed to a town hall with maddie .
you negotiated !
yeah , i told you .
we delayed twice already ; we couldn &apos;t delay any more .
i said wait !
yes , but i said we couldn &apos;t .
you &apos;re challenging me ?
i &apos;m trying to run a campaign .
eli ...
you have been too distracted .
i have to make decisions .
you &apos;re number two .
no . not ...
not anymore .
nora , get peter on the phone !
that &apos;s right , eli .
you call him , but ...
here &apos;s what &apos;s gonna happen .
it &apos;s gonna take him ten minutes to get back to you .
then 20 minutes . then a day .
he &apos;s in a meeting , he &apos;s in with the press ,
he &apos;s busy ...
he won &apos;t confront you ,
but ... you will know what it means .
peter doesn &apos;t need you anymore .
peter &apos;s in a meeting , eli .
he &apos;ll have to call back .
elsbeth , let &apos;s talk to them about making a deal .
what happened ?
i just got a call from brewer mcgower at chumhum .
cary asked him out to lunch .
why ?
to see if chumhum is happy .
they &apos;re jumping ship .
no . they &apos;re wanting us
to think they &apos;re jumping ship .
well , they &apos;re doing a good job ,
because i just called our other high @-@ profile clients .
alicia was out to lunch with sweeney &apos;s man ,
beth and john with bishop &apos;s .
what the hell ?
it &apos;s all the fourth years .
everyone who had their partnerships delayed .
that &apos;s why they &apos;re playing hardball in mock court .
they &apos;re putting on a good show for thief .
they want thief as a client , too ?
look , i think they &apos;re pissed .
like i would be , like any of us would be ,
and they &apos;re just rubbing our faces in it .
what do we do , then ?
give them their partnerships .
no , we don &apos;t negotiate with terrorists .
and this is corporate terrorism .
then we split them up .
how ?
offer one of them partnership .
oh , come on ...
you can afford one .
they &apos;re too monolithic right now .
they &apos;re united as fourth years .
create division between them ,
and their threat dissipates .
okay .
we &apos;ll need to call a vote of equity partners .
so which one ?
which one do we offer partnership to ?
i feel terrible about this young girl bella .
if i could do anything to bring her back , i would .
thank you , mr. lunt .
no further questions .
actually ...
we have a few questions , too , mr. lunt .
of course .
my apologies .
you did everything you could to ensure the safety of thief ,
didn &apos;t you ?
i did .
i think any fair analysis would find that to be true .
how many children do you have , mr. lunt ?
objection , your honor . relevance ?
mr. gardner asked his witness
many biographical details .
i &apos;m just filling out the biography .
i &apos;ll allow .
i have one daughter .
her name is karen , isn &apos;t it ?
she &apos;s 13 years old ?
yes .
do you let karen drink thief ?
watch yourself , lady .
excuse me ?
you don &apos;t bring my daughter into this .
objection , your honor . again , relevance !
your honor ,
the witness must answer the question .
this line of questioning ...
your honor , this is absolutely relevant .
excuse me ! this is nothing like a real court experience .
because you are not addressing me as the plaintiff .
the only reason you know his daughter &apos;s name
is because he &apos;s our client .
that would happen in court , mr. gardner .
he would be goaded into telling ...
that &apos;s enough !
let &apos;s have a little quiet , please .
oh , i have to go to the bathroom .
you got a problem , you bring it to me .
you don &apos;t take it to court .
what ? i &apos;m a lawyer .
you asked us .
we asked you to take this seriously .
i am taking this seriously .
you &apos;re losing us a client .
that &apos;s not my fault .
it damn well is your fault !
well , then , take us off of it ! fire us ! get rid of us !
oh , that &apos;s what you want , huh ? that &apos;s what these meetings
with clients ... is that what this is about ?
oh , my god . listen to yourself , will .
you are not the injured party , here .
what , and you are ?
i am , yes !
oh , damn it .
no , no , no , no , no , no , no .
what are you thinking ? you don &apos;t do that .
what &apos;s wrong with you ?
oh , my god .
come on .
oh ... idiot .
i will wear a wire .
but i won &apos;t get you peter . i can &apos;t get you peter .
oh ... that &apos;s what i need .
eli can get you jordan karahalios .
who &apos;s that ? the number two ?
why do i want the number two ?
he &apos;s handling the campaign finances .
you get him , you get everything .
i have one caveat .
i only deal with you .
if it gets out that i &apos;m doing this , i &apos;ll be murdered .
not murder @-@ murdered .
career murdered .
okay , you get me something real ,
something on bribery from jordan kock @-@ a @-@ rocka ,
and i won &apos;t need you to wear a wire with peter .
but only if i get something real .
we &apos;ll get you something . right , eli ?
sure .
i can &apos;t work for you two anymore .
what ? why not ?
the firm won &apos;t allow it .
i can &apos;t work for both sides .
so , here &apos;s your check back .
you &apos;re kidding me .
i don &apos;t know what that other stuff is
that ended up in the envelope with my check .
it could be anything .
they settled on another case ?
thief settled on something else ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
i can &apos;t be working for the red team .
hey , there you are .
you left all your stuff here last night .
yeah , i know . i had to rush out .
what &apos;s going on ?
yeah , kalinda got us something .
i hear you two are causing a lot of problems here .
just doing our jobs .
i need to borrow alicia for a minute .
why ?
no reason . just a quick thing .
so , the partners had a change of heart .
if you still want to be an equity partner ,
we want you .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
we need your capital contribution within the next 24 hours
or the offer moves on to someone else .
wow . you really make a girl feel appreciated .
were you under the mistaken impression
that we were here for your appreciation ?
do you want it or not ?
i want it .
good . 24 hours .
is it all the fourth years ?
no , just you .
we only had one position , you got it .
why ?
my guess ?
we think your husband &apos;s going to be governor .
how &apos;s that ?
feel appreciated now ?
just talk with your normal voice .
did you do anything illegal ?
did you bribe someone ?
i hope we &apos;re a little more subtle than that .
offer a &quot; testing , one , two , three &quot;
every now and then in private .
if there &apos;s problem ,
we &apos;ll text you &quot; not good . &quot; okay ?
okay .
let &apos;s do it .
did you make an earlier wrongful death settlement
resulting from your energy drink dogfight ?
uh , excuse me , your honor .
uh , objection .
may we approach the bench ?
sure .
your honor , we have information
that thief settled a wrongful death suit
on one of their earlier products .
what information ?
if , in fact , there was a prior settlement ,
it was subject to a gag order .
yes , your honor .
but any gag order &apos;s not the concern of this court .
that may be true , but substantiating
this supposed settlement would be the subject .
okay , thank you .
i will be siding with the defense here .
what a surprise .
go cry to your fourth years .
step back .
what &apos;s wrong with you ?
nothing .
not a thing .
want some ?
no , thank you .
are you holding a grudge ?
nope .
just don &apos;t want a biscotti anymore .
testing , one , two , three .
testing , one , two , three .
go ahead .
okay , i &apos;m heading into work right now .
testing , one , two , three .
were you ever married ?
i was .
i was , too .
happily ?
i &apos;m always happy .
okay , i &apos;m looking for jordan now .
this will be my last &quot; testing , one , two , three . &quot;
hey , do you have a minute ?
sure , eli . what do you need ?
you &apos;re not too busy ?
no , it &apos;s lunchtime . i was just practicing .
a busy life . no time to expand my horizons .
here , how &apos;s this ?
anyway , you get the idea .
so , what do you need , mr. gold ?
how many dirty calls did you hear me make ?
what &apos;s he doing ?
getting him on the record .
you can &apos;t ... you ...
what ? what can &apos;t i ?
he also scratched out &quot; two &quot; and wrote in &quot; three . &quot;
yeah . where &apos;s your proof ?
he ripped up the proof .
yeah , tough break on that .
i can &apos;t believe this .
elsbeth , i am very disappointed in you .
but you know he scratched out &quot; two ... &quot;
david laguardia , please . hurry .
do i know that ?
what does it matter if i know it ?
i just want to know .
it doesn &apos;t matter either way . we don &apos;t have proof .
it was only two dirty calls , wasn &apos;t it ?
come on , pick up , pick up .
hold on one second , mr. gold .
elsbeth .
hello ? hello ?
it was only two dirty calls , wasn &apos;t it , david ?
sure . we were one short .
yes .
technicality .
the law is filled with technicalities .
david laguardia .
he &apos;s on a wire . he &apos;s got you on a wire .
this is eli gold .
i am in the office of david laguardia .
he &apos;s just admitted that
his wiretapping application was insufficient !
damn it .
i think you &apos;re gonna have to
exclude that previous wiretap , mr. perrotti .
fruit of the poisonous tree .
so , you &apos;ve heard both cases now ,
and i just want to check your temperatures again .
how many are leaning toward the plaintiff ,
that &apos;s the girl and her lawyers ?
oh , that &apos;s a lot .
congratulations .
okay , and , um ,
now if you had to decide on an amount to award ,
what would that be ?
i think i &apos;d say around $ 50 million .
i see a lot of heads nodding . how many agree ?
okay , we make a deal . $ 12 million .
enough of these morons .
will , can we talk for a minute ?
i was offered the sole equity partnership .
i know . i heard .
this didn &apos;t have anything to do with ... ?
no , no .
are you sure ? because i ...
alicia , pat yourself on the back .
you &apos;re good .
this is because you &apos;re good .
okay .
what are we gonna do ?
i don &apos;t know .
it was a weak moment .
i know .
we should avoid being alone together .
yeah .
okay .
i &apos;m sorry , will .
about what ?
oh , i don &apos;t know .
what am i not sorry about ?
it &apos;s life .
we &apos;re in constant danger of running off the road .
i guess we won .
it doesn &apos;t feel like it , does it ?
hey , i &apos;m thinking of meeting with the thief people
just to get the partners scared we &apos;re pursuing them .
does it sound good ?
cary ?
what ?
they offered me equity partnership .
again .
really ?
yes . earlier .
i &apos;m gonna take it .
that &apos;s smart .
you think so ?
yeah .
i can , i can argue for what we want there .
argue ? what do you mean ?
with the equity partners , i can argue ...
with them for ... things .
sure . it &apos;s a good idea .
i know some of us have taken
the florrick name in vain .
those of us who have gone up against her husband .
but now we have a florrick in our ranks .
now we have a florrick sitting with us .
ladies and gentlemen of lockhart / gardner ,
i ask you to welcome our newest equity partner
alicia florrick .
we &apos;re peers now .
welcome .
thank you .
congratulations .
thank you .
congratulations .
thank you .
congratulations . - thank you so much .
congratulations .
thank you .
congratulations .
thank you .
