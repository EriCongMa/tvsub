第二十五季第二十集
homie ! homie , wake up !
you &apos;re having a nightmare .
it &apos;s not selling out . it &apos;s co @-@ branding .
co @-@ branding !
wake up !
oh , honey , the best part of every day
is waking up to your smiling face .
just like the best day of my life was when you
gave me your hand in marriage .
i &apos;d like it back , please .
hey ! drop it , you stupid dog !
that &apos;s one of my wife &apos;s pieces !
she needs it to reciprocate high fives !
that &apos;s okay , homie .
i &apos;ll just grab another .
i haven &apos;t worn this one since new year &apos;s .
is it just me , or does something seem ...
weird today ?
you &apos;re right-- something is different
about the simpsons today .
your father &apos;s wearing a tie .
oh , that &apos;s what &apos;s different !
that &apos;s the one and only thing .
maggie ! stop that !
no more playing with your food .
aw , they &apos;re so cute when they &apos;re duplo .
uh , yes , is this a toy store ?
uh @-@ huh . i &apos;m supposed to get my daughter a birthday present--
hmm , what &apos;s it called ?
here it is . perky patty &apos;s princess shop .
oh ! i &apos;m so sorry-- but i have an awesome excuse :
i was distracted driving .
oh , don &apos;t worry about it .
good thing we don &apos;t feel pain .
hey ! these are the monkey &apos;s legs !
come back ! i &apos;m a clown !
i can &apos;t afford to look ridiculous !
hey , bart , check out what i brought for share day .
whoa ! a skunk !
who should we stink first ?
it can &apos;t spray-- it &apos;s been de @-@ sacked .
the gypsy skunk @-@ seller lied !
he went in there !
stop it ! if you pull out those bricks ,
the whole school could collapse !
but there &apos;s a skunk in there .
scottish steak !
you are going to rebuild every brick of this school .
this is ages 12 and up .
age guidelines are conservative , and everyone knows it .
and to motivate you , some words of support
from the school chum .
thank you , nelson .
one perky patty &apos;s princess shop , please .
ah . always good to meet a fellow amfop .
adult male fan of princesses .
it &apos;s for my daughter .
yes , yes , it &apos;s always for the daughter .
well , that &apos;s weird .
i feel like i &apos;ve seen this toy before .
do you like it , honey ?
i love it , dad ! thank you .
well , have fun putting it together .
wait , wha ... dad , don &apos;t you want to build it with me ?
well , there &apos;s no dad on the box .
i don &apos;t want to get in trouble .
of course i do !
well , what do you know ?
i enjoyed playing with you .
me , too , dad .
no , no , no . listen to me .
we played ... and it wasn &apos;t boring .
we &apos;ve played lots of times .
of course we have !
because you &apos;re my girl and i love you .
but i &apos;m letting you in on a secret .
when parents play with their kids ,
they don &apos;t like it .
and i &apos;m no different .
suddenly i can &apos;t breathe .
every fiber of my being screams out for a nap .
and if someone handed me an issue of the new yorker ,
i would read the fiction .
i swear to god i would .
wow . but there are millions of parents in the world .
surely some of them like
playing with ...
nope , not even one .
just look at the things you kids like :
tea parties with pretend food ;
hide @-@ and @-@ seek with flagrant peeking ;
and the most inhumane torture ever devised by man ...
candy land .
but this ...
this is tolerable !
what a crazy vision .
i was in a world where nothing is made of bricks ,
except for toys !
hey , read the sign .
thank you .
marge , i &apos;m telling you ,
it was so weird .
my body was squishy ,
and my hands looked like snakes made of meat !
it was horrible !
oh , homie , it was probably just a mini @-@ stroke .
you &apos;re just saying that to make me feel better .
whatever you saw , it wasn &apos;t real .
that &apos;s how the world works .
everything fits with everything else ,
and nobody ever gets hurt .
i know .
oh , maybe you just need someone to ...
you know , take your mind off it ?
i always need that .
i only don &apos;t ask because being rejected ...
gets old .
oh , baby , i feel so close to you right now .
marge ? did you replace our regular mirror
with a magical mirror from a mystical salesman
at a weird store that if we went back to find it ,
it wouldn &apos;t be there anymore ?
no .
okay , homer , get a grip . i &apos;m sure lots of people ,
every time they look in the mirror ,
see a hideous flesh monster .
just a one @-@ time thing .
oh , brick me !
leave me alone !
why don &apos;t you go back where you came from !
i have as much right to be here as you !
i , sir , am in the advent calendar !
december 18,
final week ! huh ?
moe , i &apos;m going crazy--
i need to kill off as many of my brain cells as possible .
well , i &apos;m here to help .
what the ... ? this isn &apos;t beer .
beer is plastic circles .
how can i drink ... no , no , no , this ?
did you guys see ... that ?
oh , it &apos;s getting worse !
ugh ! rebuilding the same boring old school .
i could make this place so much cooler
if they just gave me a chance .
what have you done to my school ?
i put in a rock @-@ climbing wall ,
all the classrooms are skate parks ,
we got zip @-@ line stairwells , terminator gym teachers ,
your office is now a haunted forest--
extra ghosts . and , if you can believe it ,
two tetherball poles .
how will children learn
if they don &apos;t feel like they &apos;re in kid jail ?
relax . i used all the same bricks .
plus ralph .
yo soy language lab .
《 圣经 》 全球销量最佳大部头
but i don &apos;t want to go to church--
i &apos;m too busy going crazy .
come on , homie . when i &apos;m troubled ,
i always find solace in the airtight logic of religion .
&quot; before the world began ,
&quot; there was only table .
&quot; then the great constructor scissored open bag one
&quot; and dumped out the universe .
&quot; then came the time of the great sorting :
&quot; color to color , shape to shape , and a pile of just
&quot; windows and doors .
&quot; and everything was made of eternal , unchanging
acrylonitrile butadiene styrene , &quot;
or in the common tongue , &quot; plastic . &quot;
but , reverend , what if everything isn &apos;t made of plastic ?
i think there &apos;s more to this world .
you mean like decals ?
well , the orthodox don &apos;t use them ,
but we &apos;re a reform congregation .
no . i mean a place where nothing snaps together
and you just can &apos;t toss your kids in a dishwasher to clean &apos; em .
oh , homer , a place like that
could only exist in some kind of magic rock song .
look around-- we live in a perfect world
where everything fits together and no one gets hurt .
mustache is right .
but i &apos;m having all these hallucinations .
like right now my hands look like
they &apos;re these weird wiggly things .
i think they have a name , but i can &apos;t put my finger on it .
don &apos;t look , boys !
wait ! you guys see them , too ?
he &apos;s a freak !
take him apart and lose the pieces under the couch !
well , i don &apos;t find him disgusting .
oh , boy , that &apos;s mushy !
come on , marge . we need real answers ,
and there &apos;s only one place we can get them !
let &apos;s see , &quot; fingers . &quot;
come on , show me something about fingers .
bad news , people .
our religion is not true .
sorry about that .
really sorry .
if i &apos;m right ,
when i touch this box , it &apos;ll trigger another memory
from some alternate me &apos;s life .
if i don &apos;t come back from that other place ,
tell my wife i loved her .
i &apos;m right here .
promise me !
i can &apos;t believe all the time i wasted playing with bart
when i could have been playing with you .
our little springfield is really turning out great .
city hall , the weird @-@ smelling bank ,
rehab world ...
krustyburger , krustyburger express ,
the krustyburger where the governor got stabbed ...
oh , you two .
hey , look what i found in the &quot; arts @-@ weekend @-@ obituary &quot; section
of the paper .
a builders competition !
we got to enter our mini @-@ springfield .
we &apos;re a great team !
we &apos;re there . i &apos;ll clear my calendar .
hey , lenny , remember those two surfers we were gonna fight ?
well , you &apos;re on your own .
but you &apos;re the one who sat on their fish tacos .
great talking to you , buddy .
lisa , lisa , i spent all day at work
making a duff brewery for our mini @-@ springfield .
i don &apos;t want to brag , but ... it really brews .
huh ? where is she ?
okay , i got us tickets for the 7 : 30 show of survival games .
i &apos;ve never been to a pg @-@ 13 movie before .
i wonder what the one swear word will be .
what if it &apos;s ...
oh , i &apos;ve never heard that one .
my grampa said it at thanksgiving .
we usually don &apos;t hang out with second graders ,
but we saw your survival games book report
hanging in the hallway , and we were very impressed .
you really understood that the theme of the book was love .
hey , older girls , i &apos;m homer simpson .
that &apos;s right . lisa &apos;s playtime partner and bff .
i assume lisa told you about the pretend tiny town
she &apos;s building with her overweight father .
oh , yeah , it &apos;s gonna be mucho fresh .
come on , honey . it &apos;s time to click some bricks .
i don &apos;t know what he &apos;s doing up here .
he usually stays in the basement .
it &apos;s okay , lisa . we have dads , too .
i have three dads .
see you friday .
friday ? but that &apos;s when brick @-@ stock is .
um , actually , friday is the opening night
of the new survival games movie ,
勇敢无畏
and they invited me .
but this was our thing .
i know . i &apos;m sorry ,
but cool older girls have never wanted
to hang out with me before .
one of them wears deodorant .
i don &apos;t know which one .
oh . all right .
thanks for understanding , dad .
what just happened ?
it &apos;s not you . lisa &apos;s growing up .
it &apos;s a really complicated time
in a girl &apos;s life from age eight to ...
actually , all the rest of the way .
oh ! i finally found something i like doing with my daughter ,
and now i &apos;ve lost it .
i don &apos;t fit into her world .
this is for the tacos !
tacos , brah ! ow !
what did you build ?
辛达 · 瓦德薇儿
oh , that &apos;s the teenage crossbow ace
who stole my daughter from me .
keendah wildwill is a modern feminist hero--
strong , independent and resourceful .
she &apos;s a little ... bustier than i remember .
my work on that front is never done .
i wish i lived in little springfield .
everything fits together , and no one ever gets hurt .
apparently , our whole world is a fantasy in the mind
of an emotionally @-@ devastated homer simpson .
one of the main questions i have about that is , why ?
the real homer fears losing his daughter &apos;s love ,
so he invented this toy world where nothing will ever change .
how can you be sure ?
i have devoted my life
to second @-@ rate science fiction .
trust me , that is what we are dealing with here .
so if i don &apos;t find my way out of here ,
i could be trapped in a fantasy forever ?
i &apos;m afraid so .
i &apos;m trapped in a fantasy forever !
kiss my flat plastic butt , reality .
daddy @-@ daughter time will never end !
inventing this toy world to live in is the smartest thing
my brain @-@ damaged brain ever did .
nothing bad can ever happen here .
great throw , homer .
put it in tupperware , boys .
we &apos;ll rebuild it tomorrow .
homie , ask yourself--
can you really live in a paradise
if you know it &apos;s just pretend ?
marge , who would give up eating steak in the matrix
to go slurp goo in zion ?
we don &apos;t have that movie here .
now lisa can never ditch me , and i can play with her forever .
there , i finished .
all 12 of them .
i &apos;ll never build what i want again .
then you &apos;ve learned your lesson .
too bad i got these for my birthday .
they always give me the school .
sparkle unicorn ,
would like some more tea ?
oh , yeah , hook me up with some more of that imaginary nectar .
i &apos;ve never seen you throw yourself
into a tea party like this .
before , it always seemed like you were kind of phoning it in .
not anymore , lisa .
i &apos;ve created a perfect world
with no pg @-@ 13 movies to take you away from me .
&apos;cause in a toy town ,
everything stays shiny and wonderful ,
just the way i want it .
you &apos;ll always be my little girl .
maggie will always be my giant baby .
bart will never move out of the house .
i &apos;ll work for mr. burns forever .
marge and i will never grow old together
and live like fat cats on social security .
good lord ,
i &apos;ll never experience
the ultimate reward for a life well lived--
the gentle slumber of death .
marge , i made a terrible mistake !
the fact that kids grow up is
what makes time with them special .
i think i need to go back .
i wish you &apos;d told me that
before i bought all these groceries .
but i understand .
lego marge , you &apos;re just as cool as real marge .
who ? !
nobody , nobody .
plastic comic book guy , i need to go back home .
home ? but you &apos;ve discovered the joy of living in a world
made of toys where nothing bad can ever happen .
but i miss burning my mouth on pizza ,
and david blaine stunts where he could really die .
now tell me how to get out of here !
all you need to do is open the box
back to your so @-@ called reality .
but i can &apos;t let that happen .
huh ? you &apos;re the bad guy ?
i thought you were the rule @-@ explainer guy .
as an adult who surrounds himself with child &apos;s toys ,
i represent the part of your psyche
that prefers this artificial world .
how did you do that ? !
because , as the ultimate collector ,
i have every play set ever made .
pirates !
pajama guys !
i &apos;ll never get home .
who could build something awesome enough to save me ?
who ?
who ? ! who ? !
don &apos;t you even think about it .
you are thinking about it , aren &apos;t you ?
you are going back where you came from--
denmark .
what is that thing ?
i have no idea , but it &apos;s gonna kick his butt .
that robot is made out of batmobile ,
hobbit hole and spongebob play sets .
that &apos;s ... that &apos;s mis @-@ set @-@ genation .
kid power .
lion blast !
lightsaber barf !
fire principal !
this is strangely exhilarating .
no . no . no !
i am going to enjoy playing with this thing forever !
i &apos;m a creative but undisciplined builder !
good @-@ bye , homie .
your squishy meat family is lucky
to have a good man like you .
oh , baby , no matter what the reality ,
you &apos;re the best thing in it .
that was a little weird , right ?
a little bit .
dad , wake up .
wake up .
oh , meat lisa , it &apos;s you .
are you okay ?
oh , i had this crazy dream
where i was in a world made of lego bricks
and learned important lessons about parenting .
mmm , isn &apos;t that kind of the plot of the ... ?
no . no , it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s a new plot .
honey , what are you doing here ?
i thought you were going to your movie .
i changed my mind .
i knew how much this meant to you .
no , no , go to the movie with your friends .
if there &apos;s one thing i &apos;ve learned ,
it &apos;s that i can &apos;t stop you from growing up .
i love you , dad .
me , too , little girl .
年龄范围 130亿岁及以上 数量 无数片
勇敢无畏
thayson , joshuel , don &apos;t make me pick between you two
on the night before i reenter the struggle dome again .
we &apos;ll never stop loving you ,
even if you string us along forever .
forever .
forever .
how can i choose between two boys ,
one who &apos;s dangerous but good @-@ looking ,
the other who &apos;s strong but super cute ?
oh , my god , this is terrible .
when do they get to killing the children ?
wait a second . you &apos;re not into this ...
she &apos;s trying on dresses .
oh , i just wanted to see kids fight to the death , is all .
