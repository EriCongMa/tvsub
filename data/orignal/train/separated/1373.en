Cheers.
Yeah. Hear, hear.
Nina.
Nina? Nina, talk to me.
Just stay put, Maura.
No, it's superficial.
The EMT's on the way. Let's make sure.
Kent needs my help.
What are we looking at?
I got this.
No, I'm fine.
It appears to be a through and through
with entry just below the clavicle.
Now if the bullet shattered the clavicle, then obviously --
Any movement will sever the subclavian artery.
Okay, you apply pressure.
I will immobilize her arm in case she regains consciousness.
Damn it! Come on.
Clear.
‭Clear.
No way.
You go up that ladder, you're a sitting duck.
If she's waiting for you behind one of those windows,
she's gonna shoot before you ever see her.
What are we supposed to do, let her go?
No, you're supposed to not get yourself killed
while we're chasing her.
Come on, Jane.
Yeah, this is Detective Frank Rizzoli.
I need a 6-block lockdown,
door-to-door and rooftop search centering on Ridgeway Lane,
between Durham and Cambridge.
She okay?
She's stabilized.
She's gonna need surgery.
Did you find that shooter?
No.
Jane, Maura suffered a --
Suffered a what?
Ma.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I think so.
Startled. You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Frankie?
He's fine.
Go check Maura.
Yeah, okay.
Kent said that you -- you suffered something.What happened?
I cut my head.
Okay, the end of that sentence was not
"Maura suffered a cut on the head."
What happened?
Possible concussion.
I got a possible concussion and I cut my head.
What about the shooter?
We lost her on the fire escape.
So you got a good look at her?
No, but it was Alice Sands.
How do you know?
Because she burnt down my apartment
and she kidnapped Maura. What, it's somebody else?
I don't know, but I'm trying to build a case.
Well, how could it -- - I-I think you could both
benefit from some tactical breathing.
1, 2, 3 -- - Okay, you need to go to the hospital.
I'm gonna get a uniform to take you there, all right?
No, no, no, I'm going to the hospital.
I'm gonna check on Nina,
and I will call you if there are any updates. Okay?
Okay.
How big a perimeter did you set up?
Six blocks.
Look, why don't you stay here and take care of Kiki, okay?
I'll call you when I get the investigation moving.
You got a glove?
Thanks.
All right, this is a crime scene.
Nobody touches this unless Dr. Isles says so.
Any word from the hospital?
Yeah, Nina's out of surgery. She's doing fine.
Oh, she was lucky.
How so?
You were the target. If Sands had been aiming at her...
Yeah, I'm still here.
You see all the reporters at the front door?
Yeah, I saw 'em.
They didn't see me, though. I took the back entrance.
"Wedding Bells Ring. Shooter Flees. BPD Fails."
Your poetry sucks.
It's the headlines of one of their stories.
W-- Okay, we haven't failed. We just haven't succeeded yet.
How many apartments are there left to search?
Not many.
All right, thanks.
Well, the driver of the truck was interviewed.
He received an electronic dispatch from Ingersoll, Ontario,
telling him to drive the truck from Canada
and leave it where we found it.
And he didn't think that was strange?
Yeah, but he said he's paid for driving,
not thinking.
Did he actually say that?
Yep.
You ruling him out?
Well, he's got no criminal record.
The Mounties searched his house and his bank records
and didn't find anything indicating involvement in a drug ring.
And after he dropped off the truck, he went bowling.
So he's too boring to be involved.
That's what I'm thinking.
So how did she get away from us?
She still might be in one of those apartments.
Yeah, but you know she isn't gonna sit still.
I hate to be the bearer of bad news,
but I didn't find anything in the shooter's truck.
No fingerprints except for the driver's.
No unusual fibers.
Police Academy made Alice Sands a good criminal.
I sent the tape from the box she traveled in to MIT.
I'm wondering if trace amounts of DNA...
from her breath might have stuck to the adhesive.
Okay.
So they're... going to...
What?
Call an ambulance.
They're gonna call an amb--
Maura!
Maura.
I'm fine.
Is she fine?
If you don't tell her, I'll have to, and she won't believe me.
So please, you'd be doing me a favor.
My preliminary examination indicates a concussion.
But it's unusual for someone to lose consciousness
that long after the injury, so I'm giving her a CAT scan.
We'll re-evaluate after we get those results.
And we're going to the CAT scan now?
I have an appointment. Later.
And... we can wait because she's fine?
Well, she needs to rest,
which means limited physical and mental activity.
Code blue, OR 3. Code blue, OR 3.
So none of you can answer a direct question?
What she just said was perfectly clear.
Okay. I'm taking you home. Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I wanna go back to the office.
No.
My CAT scan is not scheduled till tomorrow,
so I'm not just gonna sit around and wait.
I wanna help find Alice Sands.
And anyway, I'd rather be at BPD where you can keep an eye on me.
If you don't take it easy, I'm gonna have you arrested.
On what charges?
Failure to listen to me.
Clinical stubborn-- I-I don't know.
I'll think of something.
Here's what we got.
We know Alice Sands is the sole shareholder
of New Brunswick Woodworks.
And now we've tied New Brunswick
to several other companies that are doing cross-border business.
What took so long?
Well, Nina was in the middle of working on it
when she went to the wedding.
Did we get the info to the Canadian drug authorities?
Yeah. And the DEA. We're tightening the noose.
On her businesses. We're nowhere on finding her.
Did they finish the search?
All six blocks, every room, every rooftop. Didn't find her.
Nobody saw her.
She's not in any of the video we pulled.
She's vanished.
Well, it pisses me off.
I'll be back in five.
All right.
Hi. I-I didn't wanna come upstairs.
I didn't know what I'd be getting in the middle of.
How's Mimi?
she was drunk enough that some of the chaos eluded her.
I'm glad everyone's okay... or will be okay.
Me, too.
Well, at least they'll remember it.
I-I know. I know you need to go. I just...
I wanted to see you.
Thanks. I'll call you later.
‭Okay.
There you are.
Easy. Easy. Lie down.
There's been a lot of poking and prodding and stitching up.
All I remember is the rice.
It wasn't my rice, I promise.
How you feel?
Like my bruises have bruises.
Is everyone else okay?
Yeah. Everyone's okay.
Well, the non-cop guests are a little freaked out, but...
Nicole?
Probably wishes I hadn't invited her.
Did we catch Alice Sands?
Not yet.
What are you working on?
Alice is hiding somewhere.
I'm trying to figure out where and if anyone's helping her.
Okay. What do you know so far?
All right, so...
I got a banker and a lawyer who signed off on documents...
Where are you going?
To that drawer to get a red pen.
I did walk in here under my own power.
Yeah, well, that wouldn't have been my choice,
and now you're under my care, so...
There.
You are not my doctor.
No, I am not your doctor,
but I am someone who could call Detective Rizzoli
and tell her you're not looking very well,
which would rain down a heap of hellish goodwill upon your head.
Can you get that printout for me?
Yep.
Why are you printing out an evidence inventory?
Well, I couldn't find pictures of the alley
from the night of the shooting,
so I thought I might look through the log
and see if somebody might have mislabeled the files.
But the alley wasn't part of the crime scene.
I mean, the police locked it down to do a quick search,but...
We didn't send a Crime Scene Unit there.
Alice is smart.
Maybe she just made it seem like
she disappeared into that building.
We need to get a CSRU team there immediately.
I'm on it.
I got nothing.
Then you're way ahead of me.
People don't just disappear. They leave trails.
Forensic trails, paper trails.
She's good. Yeah, well, she's not better than us.
Not forever, no. But this time, looks like she got away.
We just have to hope she didn't run too far.
I'm just being honest.
You read Maura's psych profile.
She's not gonna quit until she's beat me.
Profiles are just educated guesses.
As hard as it is to believe, Maura could be wrong.
She's not wrong.
Alice went to Canada to try and fool us.
She snuck back to try and surprise us.
This is all part of her plan, and it failed.
So now she's gotta figure out her next move.
She's not gonna run...
because I'm not gonna let her.
Detective Rizzoli!
All right, as you know,
our BPD analyst, Nina Holiday, was shot yesterday.
We do have a suspect. It's a woman named Alice Sands.
She's a convicted drug dealer.
She's also a police academy dropout.
I have nothing further to add at this time,
except it's clear that
she wasn't good enough to be a part of BPD.
So it's just a matter of time
before we find her and bring her to justice.
Thank you.
So...stubborn!
You are the best cop I know,
but sometimes you do the stupidest things!
Well, we all have our gifts.
Well, why not just put a target on your chest
and walk down the street?!
I had to draw her out.
You undermined the chain of command
and put yourself in a position to get suspended or fired!
Well, that's better than letting her get away!
Oh, you make it so hard for me to defend you!
Vince, I don't want you to get in trouble.
Oh, well, it's a little late for that.
I can't...
We can't let her hurt anybody else.
What?!
Nina and I found something.
Nina's back?
Not exactly.
A-anyway, Joe Harris, the prison shrink,
was on the payroll of a consulting firm
that we've tied to Alice's companies.
We need to talk to every employee
of that consulting firm.
I'll take care of that.
You gotta go downtown.
‭I do?
Yeah. The chief wants to talk to you.
Keep me posted, please.
I will... if I'm allowed to!
How do you do it?
Do what?
Well...
I tried to make Vince feel better,
but I clearly made him feel worse.
And now I feel bad.
Yeah. Can't make them feel better.
I've learned after all these years...
Well, I just keep my mouth shut and listen.
Well...it's not particularly comforting.
Yeah. Yeah, you'll get the hang of it.
Yeah.
How's Ron doing?
Well, he was, uh, calm doctor guy at the scene
until his daughter called.
She'd seen him on the news.
That couldn't have been good.
Probably not.
I mean, it's one thing for me to deal with it,
maybe an okay choice for him.
But how far can it trickle down
until the effects of this job aren't okay?
So how's the honeymoon going?
What are you doing?
Hoping I didn't miss something.
This? Not "Taking it easy."
Well, I've never done so little work at the office.
So you feel better?
Yes.
Lying.
I feel good enough to help.
It'd be nice if you found something,
help everybody forget how mad they are at me.
The impromptu press conference?
The chief of police seems to think that I'm not camera-friendly.
Or just friendly. I don't know.
You are plenty friendly.
Thank you.
Most of the time.
Okay.
So MIT's test on the packing tape was inconclusive.
I've run every analysis I can think of,
and all the materials in the van turned up nothing.
I don't have a single bit of physical evidence
to identify Alice Sands, or anyone else.
So we can't prove that she's connected with the shooting?
No.
So even if we find her, we can't arrest her.
No. But I did send a CSRU team back to examine
every step of her escape route, especially the alleyway.
All we need is a hair, a cell, a drop of blood.
We'll find something.
I like your optimism.
Joe Harris had financial problems.
He was a month or two from filing for bankruptcy
when Alice arrived at the prison.
She saved his ass. Yeah.
Did he know the contract and the money came from Alice?
Unclear.
He did. She's like a spider, luring people into her web.
She saves him, makes him think that she loves him.
Eventually, he loves her back. He'll do anything for her.
Burn down my apartment. Kidnap Maura.
Die.
If Alice is so charismatic,
I can't believe you don't remember her from the academy.
I think she was too busy hating me to try to be friends.
A lot of people feel that way.
Hey, Maura.
CSRU finished their investigation of the alley.
Okay. What'd they find?
Nothing.
Alice's DNA isn't on the fire escape ladder.
There's no smudged fingerprints, like she wiped it down.
And more importantly,
there's no disturbance in any of the dusty surfaces
on the higher rungs.
So she didn't go up the ladder.
No. Our theory of how Alice got away is wrong.
Maybe she didn't make it this far.
We didn't see her on the street.
I mean, there's no place else she could've gone.
We searched all these buildings.
Then we missed her.
What if she didn't go up?
She went down.
Find anything?
No. We went into the sewer about a hundred yards
and eventually lost the footprints.
And then the tunnels split off into three different directions,
so should could be anywhere.
You smell bad.
Don't go there.
From where she climbed in,
she could be anywhere in the city.
It's the perfect way to move drugs around.
No wonder she was never caught.
You smell less than fresh.
What?
You were gonna say something.
Maybe.
What did the Department of Works say?
Well, apparently, hundreds of people live in the tunnels.
Rousting them is not a budgetary priority,
but sometimes when they're doing construction,
the police clear 'em out.
You have a twinkle in your eye.
A couple days ago, a guy ran when he should have listened.
Cops saw him dumping white powder down the runoff.
They couldn't recover it,
so they couldn't arrest him for possession, but...
Do we know where he is?
I have someone bringing him in right now.
Yes!
Sorry. We're not open.
Joann.
Angela.
How you doing?
Well, I guess not bad. You know, considering.
Yeah. My dad said you were very brave.
Yeah, well, Ron's a little biased.
Can I get you a cup of coffee?
No. Actually, I, uh, I gotta go pick up the kids.
So...
How are you doing?
I...
I know this is, uh, really hard.
Yeah. Well, that's an understatement.
Yes.
My daughter was sitting with me
when I saw him on TV.
Her brother found her in her room this morning, crying.
He -- he made her a police car out of LEGOs and said,
"I'll keep Grandpa safe."
He's 5, Angela.
He's not supposed to be thinking about things like that.
No, he's not. I'm so sorry, Joann.
I mean, my dad could've been shot.
He -- or -- or -- or worse. My God.
I know.
I don't know why I came here. I-I don't -- I don't know w--
what I expect you to say. I just...
I'm sorry. I...
You've got work to do.
Three strikes you're out, Isaac.
Look, I get loyalty, okay?
But Alice Sands isn't gonna bake you cookies
while you rot upstate for 40 years.
She can't help you. We can help you...
if you give us information that helps us find her.
I don't know where she is.
Tell us how Alice is using the tunnels.
We can get you gentle time. We can get you less time.
You won't do squat, and you know it.
Fine. We tried nice.
Now let's try naked. Get your clothes off.
What?
What?
Isaac Weston, you are under arrest
for being an accessory after the fact
in the shooting of a BPD employee.
I'll get you a jumpsuit. You give me your clothes.
Now.
She also isn't gonna bake you cookies.
I really don't need to be pushed to the door.
Nobody does. That means you're leaving at the right time.
Really? It's embarrassing.
Nothing I can do.
Can I do this?
All yours.
Just got more embarrassing.
Oh, come on. I'd let you push me out of the hospital.
Shouldn't you be at work?
Well, technically, helping a colleague is a work function.
Besides, I don't have anything pressing going on right now.
I don't believe you.
Are all patients this ornery?
The food makes them angry.
Well, we'll stop for a burger.
Where's Kent?
Oh. The test on the drug runner's clothes
are still in process.
No, I'm not asking you. You're supposed to be taking it easy.
I am taking it easy.
Yeah?
Where are we on the tests on the clothes?
Uh, in process. Hey.
Hey.
The bell was his idea.
So you're just sitting here.
The furthest I've gone is the ladies' room.
That's very unstubborn of you.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
You still have a headache?
I'm drinking Chinese skullcap tea.
Can you just... answer a direct question?
I'm dealing with it.
All right.
Please call me if you need anything.
Of course.
Okay.
Still in process.
After you get the results from the...
from...the...
The mass spectrometer?
Yes.
Yeah, um, make sure to check the calibration.
Yeah, of course. Will do.
Mass spectrometer.
Mass spectrometer.
Mass spectrometer.
She gives us food, clothes.
I don't have anything bad to say about her.
That's because you don't know her very well.
She's dangerous,
and we need to find her before she hurts somebody else.
Says you.
Why don't we let the courts
decide whether she's a saint or a sinner?
We just wanna know how to find her.
I don't know.
When was the last time you saw her?
It's been a while.
The officers that found you two in the tunnels
said you were pretty well set up.
I'm sure you don't want us to be bothering you all the time.
Don't you guys have better things to do?
We do.
Detective Rizzoli?
Yeah.
Alice says "Hello."
You tell Alice to go to hell.
Jane.
I assume you're familiar with the machine.
Yes. I was on the advisory committee
when they did the revisions for the exposure standards.
I meant you know that you just lay down
and hold your breath when I ask you to.
Of course. That, too.
It won't take long.
Climb on up.
Okay. Well, thank you for getting me in early.
When the chief of staff says this is a priority,
I assume it's a priority.
Hey. I'm, uh, I'm just confirming the results.
They should be on Dr. Isles' desk in about 10 minutes.
I called her. She didn't answer.
That's just information, right? That's not a question?
Where is she?
Uh, she said she had an appointment.
When did she leave?
About an hour and a half ago.
Where did she go?
I don't know.
Why not?
To be fair, I didn't think it was any of my business.
She suffered a head injury yesterday.
Everything she does is your business.
Now that we got that clear...
Jane.
Shit.
Hey! What a nice surprise.
I hope I'm not interrupting some life-saving procedure.
Just finished rounds.
The, uh, med students were all thoroughly confused.
I think we helped everyone by stopping.
Not ready to smile yet?
Sorry.
It was funny.
So what's going on?
Um, I wanna talk to you.
Uh, I'm free in 20 minutes. You wanna go to the cafeteria?
I...
I can't wait.
Okay.
Dr. Williams, call intensive care.
Dr. Williams, intensive care.
The shooting, it's, uh,
brought a lot of things into perspective for me.
I get that.
I have to break up with you.
What?
I have to focus on my children and making sure they're okay.
So do you. And...
I know this comes as a surprise...
But it's the right thing to do.
No. No, it isn't. I...
You're in shock, Angela. You...
I've made up my mind.
Just...
I got shot at yesterday.
I know.
Yeah, your friend's wedding.
Yes.
All I'm asking is that you take some time to let all this...
sink in so that we can talk about things.
I'm sorry, Ron, but I've made up my mind.
I need to write up my reports.
Shouldn't you be recuperating somewhere?
I'm fine.
Yeah, I've been shot. It feels shitty, not fine.
Thank you for saying that.
It was hurting just to sit up straight and breathe.
Then what are you doing here?
I just...
I remember how I felt after my fiancé was shot.
Powerless, scared.
I don't wanna feel like that again.
So you wanna find the person who shot you?
More than anything.
You promise to go home when the pain gets too much?
Promise.
Let's get started.
This is what we know.
Yeah, do you need anything?
A snack? Water? Anything like that?
No, thank you, and you don't need to be getting me snacks.
Ah. Right. Yeah.
It's just that Detective Rizzoli thinks
I'm not taking my caregiving responsibilities seriously enough.
Ah. Well, she worries.
Well, she's right.
When I ran away from being a doctor,
I think I ran a little bit too far.
I guess I could be a bit more...empathetic.
Couldn't we all?
You're very empathetic.
People have used a lot of words to describe me.
I'm not sure that was ever one of them.
Yeah, well, they don't know you, do they?
But I do sometimes wonder
what kind of a doctor I would have been.
I mean, to live people.
A great one. Brilliant even, if somewhat overdressed.
Anyway, is that why you rang me?
No. No, I have, um, I've been thinking
that you have been here a while now,
a lot longer than we originally planned.
Yeah, well, God bless Wilkins for needing a new kidney.
So I think you need more responsibilities.
Perhaps a raise to go along with it.
So we can talk about it in the days to come.
Uh, I mean, it's not like I haven't thought about it.
I've got all these ideas and...
Okay. So shall we have lunch on Monday?
Yeah.
Thank you. Thank you.
You're welcome.
I mean, I get it. She's angry. She's frustrated.
But it's not enough that Nina got shot?
The note was a location for a meeting. Clearly a setup.
No rational person -- certainly no cop --
is gonna fall into a trap like that.
But why not just take the note and walk away?
Why fan the fire?
I don't know why it bothers me so much.
I guess...
I know I'm going to retire.
Someday. Not too far in the future.
And Jane's gonna work another 10 or 15 years at least.
What if her next partner isn't as...
You love her.
Yes. I...
Yes.
But I can only control the things I control, right?
Yeah.
Right now I-I have to do my job.
I just have to do my job and help Jane find Alice Sands.
Thank you.
‭Aren't I lucky to
have married the smartest woman in the world?
Yes.
Later.
Okay, her note said for me to meet her here,
which means I can be ambushed from here, here, or here.
Also gives Alice an escape route through this tunnel,
that access door, this steam vent.
She picked this area. It's because she's familiar with it.
Maybe, but the drug runner was picked up near Columbia Road.
That's nowhere near here.
And she's too smart to draw all of BPD
into the part of the tunnels
that she's using for her organization.
You think she really expects you to meet her?
No.
No, I think that she needs to regroup,
and she's hoping that we waste some time playing out this thread.
So we ignore the note
and start looking for her around Columbia Road.
Focus on sections of the system
that were built in the early 20th century.
Where have you been?
I had an appointment.
I will tell you about it later,
because the mass spectrometer indicates
that the clothes you brought me from the drug runner
were dusted with clay, shale, iron --
all by-products of the soft mud process,
which is how bricks were made before steam machinery.
Nina, how are you feeling?
Better, mostly. You?
I'm -- I'm doing fine.
I'm just fine.
Below Quincy Street,
there's a sealed off underground pumping station.
It was built in 1894,
then decommissioned after the Great Depression,
when the federal government financed
a WPA-related sewer rebuild.
So let's set a trap.
Okay, you take this door here.
And I'll take the door at the end of the tunnel.
All right. Everybody should be
in position at the other doors,
if all has gone according to planned.
Give two minutes till target time.
Okay. See you inside.
Careful.
Careful's my middle name.
I know your middle name. I wish it was "Careful."
I'm impressed, Jane.
I didn't really think you'd go where I tell you to,
but I didn't think you'd find me, either.
Yeah, well, I can't take all the credit.
So modest. That's how I remember you.
Yeah, I doubt that's how you remember me.
I'm just trying to be polite, Jane.
The academy was a long time ago, Alice.
You seem too smart to be still upset
about somebody who beat you in a rope climb.
You don't remember anything about me.
You just crammed a lifetime of crazy and disappointment
onto our shared history.
If you'd been able to handle
just a little bit of competition,
you'd probably be the chief of police right now.
Looking for your backup?
There's only one way in.
We sealed the other doors.
You're alone.
Put the gun down, Alice. Enough people have been hurt.
Shoot the others.
No!
Get on the ground! All of you, get on the ground now!
Get your hands behind your head!
Hands behind your head now!
Don't move.
We searched for three hours.
Above ground, below ground. Nothing.
‭Well, now you've flushed her out.
And tomorrow, you'll figure out where she's gone.
I would love to continue today, but I just...
The mind works better with rest.
Yes.
I like your new place. It's homey.
Thank you.
Here you go.
I can't. I have to wait at least a few more days.
It's not bad enough that you have a concussion.
But Alice took away alcohol as well?
So where were you this afternoon?
At the hospital.
And what'd you find out?
What makes you think I had to find out anything?
Because when you have something important to say,
you always exhale a lot louder than when you don't.
I always thought it was a relaxation technique.
Do I really do that?
Oh. I do do that.
You also have a tendency to change the subject
and ask a lot of questions when it's really bad news.
Oh, everybody does that, don't they?
Like that.
I had some internal bleeding
to my temporal lobe from the fall,
and it's caused some cognitive impairment.
So what are they gonna do?
There's no reason to do anything.
You know, and the bleeding has stopped. I'm fine.
The brain -- it's funny.
In two days, it might be like nothing ever happened.
But right now?
I'm forgetting things.
Small things. Words.
Like "mass spectrometer."
Though obviously I remember it now
because I did a Memory Palace technique ealier today.
Where I put the mass spectrometer in a different room.
Maura.
That really helped...helped me.
I'm not gonna worry about the things I can't control.
I'm gonna do what my doctor tells me to do
and I'm going to let my friends help me
if I have a few small problems.
Of course.
We'll get through it.
I know.
Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of my God,
intercede for me
that I may obtain the grace to make a good confession.
All your blessed Archangels, Angels and Saints of God,
pray for me.
Amen.
In the name of Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen.
Forgive me Father, for I have sinned.
It's been...really long time since my last confession.
I'm not really sure what I should say.
There are...a lot of reasons
that I should come here.
I'm sure
none of them are why I'm here today.
What have you come to confess Jane?
What have you done?
Someone's after me.
They're hurting my friends,
my family.
It's not what I've done.
It's what I'm gonna do.
