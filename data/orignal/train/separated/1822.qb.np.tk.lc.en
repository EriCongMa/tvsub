no animals were harmed in the production of this episode
the chief is under the spell
of some insane man in camouflage .
major owen hunt.i &apos;m a trauma surgeon .
you &apos;re reading your mom &apos;s diary ?
i &apos;m not half the surgeon my mother was .
the chief wants us to give george one of our interns ?
you didn &apos;t even think to ask for me ?
screw you , dr. o &apos;malley .
we can take it slow. maybe just first base .
meredith .
i &apos;m only opening one box .
the plan was not to open any .
the plan was to take your mom &apos;s boxes up to the attic .
look. it &apos;s anatomy jane .
for a surgeon , every patient is a battle field .
i &apos;ll never have my own office .
they &apos;re our terrain ,
where we advance , retreat ...
try to remove all the land mines .
and she still has her little twosh .
her what ?
anatomy jane had detachable organs .
i could never remember their real name , so i made up name
like , the twosh was next to the chubbel ,
and that was connected to the slivvy .
oh , and look.it &apos;s the jelly pouch .
jelly pouch . my favorite
still can &apos;t get enough of the jelly pouch .
and just when you think you &apos;ve won the battle ,
made the world safe again ...
along comes another land mine .
so are we screwing other people or not ?
what ?
i just want to know if you &apos;re gonna go off
and screw o &apos;malley or some other loser ,
because then i don &apos;t have to cancel my plans
with the chick from peds .
you &apos;re an ass .
what ?
that was amazing
it was for me , too .
i mean , that was amazing .
for me , too .
my whole life ...
my whole adult life , i have been with men .
and it always felt , you know , fine , good ,
but ... i never ...
i mean--i mean , i did , but not ...
not like this .
this is like needing glasses .
um , i &apos;ve blinded you ?
no .
when i was a kid , i would get these headaches ,
and i went to the doctor ,
and they said that i needed glasses .
i didn &apos;t understand that .
it didn &apos;t make sense to me because i could see fine .
and then i get the glasses , and i put them on ,
and i &apos;m in the car on the way home ,
and suddenly i yell ...
because the big green blobs
that i had been staring at my whole life ,
they weren &apos;t big green blobs .
they were leaves on trees .
i could see the leaves .
and i didn &apos;t even know i was missing the leaves .
i didn &apos;t even know that leaves existed ,
and then ... leaves .
you are glasses .
i am so gay .
i am so , so , so gay .
i am extremely gay .
i have to go .
gentlemen .
i want you to meet
the new head of trauma at seattle grace .
major owen hunt . i &apos;m a trauma surgeon .
you remember derek shepherd , mark sloan .
he stole my patient .
mine , too .
now you &apos;ll get a chance to steal mine .
looking forward to it .
can &apos;t wait .
i just talked to a friend of mine at the d.o.h.
now that we have owen , we are being reclassified
as a level i trauma unit by the end of the month .
that explains it .
so my mom bought it for me when i was 5 ...
which is a super creepy gift for a 5 year old ,
but i kinda liked it .
run !
okay . what was that all about ?
i just saw owen.major owen hunt
you know , the guy who pulled the icicle from my chest .
oh . i thought he was in iraq .
well , yeah , he was and now he &apos;s here ,
i mean , at my hospital .
okay , so ?
so ... so we kissed.i mean he kissed me .
it was stupid . it was nothing.it was a stupid nothing .
but you don &apos;t think he thinks it was a stupid nothing .
well , i mean , he obviously likes me , and now he &apos;s back .
what &apos;s he doing back ?
you don &apos;t think he quit the military for you .
i mean , that would be severely stalkery , but very romantic
i &apos;m not getting involved with another attending .
coast clear ?
you paged me , chief ?
uh , yes , i did .
because generally , when i &apos;m paged to the helipad ,
there &apos;s something landing on the helipad.yeah.
you pulled off a 12 @-@ person domino surgery last week .
that &apos;s the kind of thing we need every week .
it &apos;s also the kind of thing that shows me
that you &apos;re gonna be a great surgeon someday .
thank you , sir
it &apos;s not enough .
i don &apos;t want you to be just great , miranda .
i want you to be the best , and if you &apos;re gonna succeed me
as the best general surgeon in this hospital ,
you need to start now , today ,
which means you need to be me .
you want to take point on a surgery ? take point .
a problem comes up ? solve it.don &apos;t talk to me . just do it .
be me .
be you ?
be me .
i could do that .
i don &apos;t know why you had to bring me all the way here to ...
that &apos;s why .
lake washington med is sending over a 10 @-@ year @-@ old girl
with an abdominal leiomyosarcoma .
it &apos;s inoperable .
you &apos;re gonna have to put together a team
and come up with a plan to save her .
save a girl with an inoperable tumor ?
it isn &apos;t easy being me .
what &apos;s wrong with you ?
what &apos;s wrong with me ?
we &apos;ve been sleeping together for a week ,
and already , you &apos;re bored .
i &apos;m hot and great in bed .
so what is wrong with you ?
look , i didn &apos;t say i was bored .
i just asked whether or not
i should keep sleeping with michelle
i &apos;m asking if you &apos;re all @-@ in. what &apos;s so wrong with that ?
you &apos;re a barbarian .
how can i be all @-@ in with an actual barbarian ?
fine . claudia in radiology
i have a hot ass .
i &apos;ll tap that next .
you do that .
oh , lexie . would you mind pick ... lexie , i &apos;m your roommate .
you &apos;re eventually gonna have to talk to me .
i reject that supposition .
i reject your rejection .
and i ignore your rejection of my rejection .
what ?
i don &apos;t reject you , george .
thank you .
okay , two things
you all have a skills lab this morning . it is mandatory .
don &apos;t even think about trying to get out .
second , one of you
will not have to go to the mandatory skills lab
because you will be assisting me in my efforts to remove
an inoperable tumor
from a 10 @-@ year @-@ old girl .
i &apos;ll do it .
no , you won &apos;t . you have a hundred delinquent charts .
you will do those after the lab .
slacker
how can you operate on an inoperable tumor ?
karev is also out .
what did i say ?
you doubted me .
oh , i @-@ i @-@ i @-@ i don &apos;t doubt you , dr. bailey .
yang is out , too
why ?
you weren &apos;t supportive of a fellow resident
who couldn &apos;t get his paperwork under control.oh !
what is that ? grey , is that anatomy jane ?
yes .
with the 24 removable organs
and the optional parts to simulate pregnancy ?
yes . does that mean i &apos;m out , too ?
no , that means you &apos;re in .
oh , that &apos;s not fair .
yes ! next time , you &apos;ll know to bring in an ugly doll ,
won &apos;t you , stevens ?
dr. yang , what exactly happens in a skills lab ?
who are you ?
i &apos;m a new intern.rayn spalding .
oh , i &apos;m never gonna remember that .
you &apos;re , um , uh , 4.2 .
three , move .
is everything okay ?
shut up . don &apos;t move .
i &apos;m dr. hunt .
over the next few months ,
i will be teaching you how to work
quickly and efficiently to keep someone alive
in circumstances where the safe bet is
they &apos;re dead by the end of the hour .
now does anyone have a problem working with live tissue ?
live tissue ?
anyone ? speak now.in fact , leave now .
if not , i own you for the rest of the day .
good . here we go .
each resident gets a pig. interns assist . hang on .
go ahead .
save their lives .
you &apos;re a monster .
they &apos;re under . they didn &apos;t feel any pain .
ask the veterinarian .
you stabbed them .
so we can save them .
we can practice on--on surgical mannequins .
we can learn to do the exact same stuff .
does that mean you &apos;re out ?
yeah , i &apos;m out .
in that case , who wants two pigs ?
tori begler , age 10 .
tori has an abdominal leiomyosarcoma .
the tumor is wrapped around her celiac artery ,
her splenic arteraynd her left gastric artery .
it is considered unresectable .
did you understand a word of that , tori ?
not really .
grey .
this is anatomy jane .
she &apos;s kinda funny looking .
she is funny looking ,
but she &apos;s very helpful .
so the tumor ...
is way down here in your belly .
it &apos;s hard to get at because it &apos;s underneath all these organs
hard , but not impossible , right ?
we &apos;re gonna try everything we can .
everything you can should include your cardiothoracic gal .
dr. stewart at seattle pres
said the vasculature is the big problem ,
and you stole the best cardiovascular surgeon
he &apos;s ever had .
if she &apos;s not on tori &apos;s team , we &apos;re leaving
and going to san francisco .
fudge ? it &apos;s homemade .
i love this hospital .
yeah , enough small talk.come on .
more lessons ?
no , no lessons . just sex .
nothing fancy.just plain old missionary ,
boy / girl , penis / vagina sex .
oh.hey , hey , i mean it.no dirty talk .
no erica talk . no talk.just grunting and grinding .
now who &apos;s talking dirty ?
shut up .
what &apos;s this about ?
i &apos;m testing a theory .
good . that looks good .
are you petting the pig ?
i @-@ i was
stop petting the pig .
you seem to be spending a lot of time on that anastamosis .
what was your name again ?
yang . cristina yang .
right . come take a look at this guy &apos;s pig .
o &apos;malley ?
oh , this is gonna be good .
here , make way for dr. yang .
you see what he did ? he stopped the bleeding ,
and then he moved onto his liver lacerations .
yes , but sloppy work can lead to complications .
two days from now when this pig starts vomiting blood ,
o &apos;malley &apos;s gonna wish he &apos;d been a little more thorough .
he can come back later and make things pretty
when his pig is stable .
meanwhile , your pig is getting acidotic and hypothermic .
if this was some scrawny kid instead of a pig ,
he &apos;d be dead by now.quick and dirty , cristine .
&quot; a. &quot; cristina .
okay , let &apos;s guide the catheter into the celiac axis .
turning on the fluoro .
what the ... uh , excuse me a second .
uh , hello.you can &apos;t be in here .
that &apos;s my uncle pat and aunt jean .
they like to make sure i don &apos;t get lonely .
she &apos;s not lonely . dr. grey and i are very entertaining .
uh , uh , okay , fine .
um , they have to stayin there , though .
there &apos;s radiation in here .
all right , let &apos;s , uh , inject dye .
is everything okay ?
uh , it--it &apos;s fine .
owen hunt is a murdering , sadistic bastard .
let me guess.first wet lab ?
he &apos;s stabbing pigs , defenseless pigs .
or as he likes to call them , &quot; live tissue , &quot;
because god forbid you should call them animals .
well , he is the new headof trauma , stevens .
it may not be ideal , but if that &apos;s how he does things ,
you should roll with it .
we don &apos;t need live subjects .
what happened tofirst do no harm ?
that &apos;s not just about humans.that &apos;s about all living things .
actually , i thinkit &apos;s just about humans .
i &apos;m saying this to you as my roommate
and not my attending
you disgust me .
damn it .
what , it wasn &apos;t good for you ?
impossible .
it &apos;s not that it wasn &apos;t good . it &apos;s that it was .
a &quot; thank you &quot; would &apos;ve been nice .
you paged me ?
i &apos;ve got a 10 @-@ year @-@ old girl
with a tumor wrapped around her aorta .
i &apos;m putting together a team .
this is her angio ?
she just
this thing is wrapped around five major arteries .
it &apos;s bad , but i &apos;ve gota couple of ideas
good for you .
try them on someone who might actually live .
i @-@ i admit , it doesn &apos;t look great ,
but her family mentioned you by name , so i thought
that &apos;s nice , but i really don &apos;t care .
well , i do .
don &apos;t get emotional , bailey .
no one likes a girl who gets emotional .
still ... i &apos;d like you on my team .
i &apos;m sorry about this , little guy .
it must have been awful .
one day , you &apos;re at some beautiful farm out in the country
breathing in the fresh air , lounging in the mud
with all your friends , and next thing you know ,
you &apos;re sedated and stabbed in some skills lab .
get it together , three .
heads @-@ up , everyone .
you , take your interns down to the e.r.
i &apos;ll meet you down there .
trauma ?
multiple m.v.c six incoming.you , lab &apos;s over . do your charts .
what about my pig ?
she &apos;s got it .
what ?
you &apos;re staying here
wait , with a half @-@ dozen crash victims coming into the pit ?
you got four struggling victims right here . keep them alive
wait , all of them ?
karev gets to work on mangled people ,
and i &apos;m stuckwith 300 pounds of bacon ?
live bacon ,
and it better be that way when i get back .
35 @-@ year @-@ old backseat passenger .
forehead versus window , and the window won .
also has second @-@ degree burns on the left side .
vitals stable en route.trauma one . what do you got ?
charles hiott , 46 , positive ecchymosis over abdomen .
last b.p. in the field--96 or 68 .
do you know how to use a trauma ultrasound ?
yes .
in that case , he &apos;s all yours in trauma two .
what do you @-@ can i help you gentlemen ?
dr. karev paged us .
well , he shouldn &apos;t have.we got it covered . thanks .
you have a head injury and burns
so i don &apos;t thinkyou have it covered .
karev , are you a doctor ?
uh , yes , sir .
are you capable of assessing a patient &apos;s injuries ?
yep .
like i said , we got it covered .
you know what ? we &apos;re here .
why don &apos;t you let us just dive in ?
appreciate the offer , shepherd ,
but i want my residents to learn how to deal with trauma .
they &apos;re not gonna learn as muchor as fast if they stand back
and watch attendings do it , unless that attending is me .
three other hospitals have already sent them away ,
and if we were smart , we would do the same thing .
what is the matter with you ?
we can try and cut around the stomach .
no , the only way to do that is to actually take it out .
they &apos;ve done ex vivo autotransplants .
yeah , with livers and kidneys .
so why don &apos;t we take out the stomach and the kidneys ?
oh , yeah , that &apos;d be great if you wanted to kill her .
we &apos;re talking about
two completely different blood supplies here .
so , no , not a good idea , grey .
who are those people ?
uh , that &apos;s tori &apos;s dad randy
and his brother pat and pat &apos;s wife jean
and tori &apos;s brother david and--
why are they staring at us , dr. bailey ?
i don &apos;t think they &apos;re staringat us , chief .
i think they &apos;re just waiting , seeing if we have any news .
look , try and come up with something before i get back .
close the blinds , grey .
you paged me ?
rambo is completely out of control .
excuse me ?
hunt . he kicked me out of my own e.r.
did he kill somebody ?
not yet .
then call me when he does .
richard .
i don &apos;t have time for it , shep.i have a dying 10 year old
and a team of doctors who can &apos;t stop bickering long enough
to solve a problem , except for your girlfriend ,
who &apos;s more interested in playing with a doll .
anatomy jane ?
she dragged that thing all around the hospital
when she was 5 years old ,
and let me tell you , it was cuter in a child.yeah.
any luck ?
what do you think ?
look , i know you want to be number one , richard ,
but we can &apos;t take in every charity case that comes along.oh.
it is a huge waste of resources .
it &apos;s your call , dr. bailey .
grey , put that away.this isn &apos;t playtime .
i &apos;m not playing.i &apos;m thinking .
what if we just took out each of the organs
where the tumor interferes with the blood supply ?
by the time you clamp off the aorta ,
you run the risk of damaging the other organs .
even if you take them out one by one ?
you don &apos;t have the time , grey .
what about if we made the time ?
dr. bailey , let &apos;s throw some stuff up on the board .
c.t. showed a subdural hematoma .
should i book an o.r. ?
first things first .
his scalpis bleeding like stink .
what do you do next ?
normally , i &apos;d page shepherd .
shepherd &apos;s not here . what do you do to stop the bleeding ?
suture the laceration , tie off the bleeders.-that &apos;ll take two hours .
what would you use in this room to take care of this ?
uh ... staples ?
it &apos;s his forehead.you ... you want this guy
to look like frankenstein for the rest of his life ? -skin glue .
excellent , karev.clean it , close it ,
and stick a pressure dressing over it .
how are you feeling , mister , uh , hiott ?
not too good .
how are we gonna make mr. hiott feel better ?
the ultrasound showed free fluid .
we &apos;ll get him to a c.t. to confirm ,
but he &apos;s pretty much o.r. bound .
excellent . is that tetanus ?
you know who you have to thank for the invention
of the tetanus shot , stevens ?
horses . the first experiments--done on horses .
you want to take outall of her abdominal organs--
intestine , stomach , everything ?
all at once ?
that &apos;s right .
we &apos;ll put the orga on ice while we dissect out the tumor ,
then reconnect the vessels using synthetic grafts
and put the organs back in .
why didn &apos;t graham
or fleisher over at lake washington suggest this ?
they &apos;rea couple of smarties .
probably becauseit &apos;s never been done before .
it is extremely risky .
there are any number of things that could go wrong .
i @-@ i don &apos;t know , randy.maybe we should try more chemo .
uh , with all due respect , mrs. begler ,
i don &apos;t think there &apos;s time for that .
is it gonna save her life ?
it &apos;s your best shot ...
your only shot .
then do it .
okay .
dr. bailey ... um , i &apos;m not a vet .
and while i can appreciate the value
of practicing technique on live tissue ,
there &apos;s a multiple m.v.c.in the pit ,
and my education would be far better served
practicing on humans .
well , w--who &apos;s babysitting the pigs right now ?
my interns .
did major hunt order the internsto babysit the pigs or you ?
that &apos;s not the point.-well , make it the point.i don &apos;t have time for this .
i &apos;m about to take six organsout of a person .
well , see ? that--that--that &apos;s not fair.i &apos;m not dr. do little .
the zebras and the elephants
are thanking their lucky stars for that .
i have a question .
why aren &apos;t we taking out the kidney
since the left renal arteryis involved ?
because we can remove the tumorwithout doing that ,
so why bother ?
i have another question .
yes ?
why can &apos;t you look at me ?
what ?
you can &apos;t look at me .
you haven &apos;t been able to look at me all day .
i think you &apos;re imagining things .
oh . i don &apos;t think i am .
but , hey , if you say so .
i do . i say so .
so instead of worrying
about whether or not i &apos;m looking at you ,
maybe you should concentrateon saving the 10 @-@ year @-@ old girl
that we &apos;re about to eviscerate .
dr. grey , why do we dose that down in quadrants ?
uh , so we can geta good luck at the vessels
to make sure we have enough for reconstruction.very good .
a little suction right in here , please .
mr. begler is on the phone .
o.r. desk wants to know if they can put him through . no .
he &apos;s pretty insistent.and i &apos;m pretty busy .
if you could hold this up a little bit higher , dr. grey .
i want to make sure to avoid--
that .
okay , let &apos;s get some clamps.another clamp , please .
right there.let &apos;s hang another bag of blood .
you better hope the aorta is not that friable ,
otherwise , all the blood inthe world won &apos;t save this girl .
ryan , what &apos;s reggie &apos;s pulse ?
69
really ? because wilbur &apos;s at 102,
and i &apos;m pretty sure that &apos;s bad .
babe &apos;s like an ox.hers is 52 .
hey , no cute names .
they &apos;re not pets .
they &apos;re subjects .
it &apos;s not our job to get all affectionate .
it &apos;s our job to keep them alive ...
so the attending who somehow thinks we &apos;re incapable
can choke on his words at the end of the day .
so i don &apos;t want to hear wilbur or babe .
you want to call them something ,
call them sausage or prosciutto .
wilbur &apos;s crashing .
what ? what did you do ?
i don &apos;t--i don &apos;t--i gotta reopen that thoracotomy .
uh , pull that chest tray back over here.yeah.
dr. bailey.removing the organs on three .
ready
one , two , three
very good.all right . let me have it .
i &apos;ll need medium and large vessel loops
to dissect out the tumor.mr. begler again .
he wants to talk to you about his daughter .
well , i &apos;m pretty busy right now .
i already told him that .
well , tell him again.i &apos;ve told him 18 times .
chief , you need to go talk to them .
hey , you did put me in charge .
i &apos;ll be back .
what t hell ?
look at this crap .
is that glue ? you used skin glue ?
dr. hunt wanted to get him outta there pretty quick .
yeah , well , because dr. hunt didn &apos;t have you
revise the wound , he could lose half his face .
you can &apos;t rotate a flap , you call someone who can .
well , he says the e.r. is like being in the field .
you use what &apos;s available
what , uh , qualifies us as a war zone , karev ,
our undermanned gift shop ,
the lukewarm drinksfrom the coffee cart ?
he &apos;s a meatballer.what do you expect ?
meatballer ? trauma guys .
they just slap it together .
dr. webber , how &apos;s tori ?
she &apos;s stable . we &apos;re removing the tumor right now .
actually , i should bein there to help ,
but i &apos;m out here instead
i just needed an update .
it &apos;s not important that you get an update right now , sir .
what &apos;s important is the best doctors
we have in this hospital are focused on your daughter .
calls don &apos;t help us focus .
interruptions don &apos;t help us focus
i &apos;m sorry . i know we have been underfoot sometimes .
but we have been to a lot of hospitals .
and hospitals are not easy places to get information .
in fact , a lot of times , it &apos;s impossible to even get
a doctor to talk to u
or to get the doctorsto talk to each other .
and i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s neglect
or their egos getting inthe way , and i don &apos;t care .
we &apos;re just trying to take care of our little girl .
she &apos;s 10 , she &apos;s scaredand she &apos;s sick .
we &apos;re doing whatever we can .
don &apos;t ever stop taking care of her like that .
stevens , have you ever used a g.i.a. stapler ?
no , but i &apos;m ready.i can handle it .
answer me three questions , and i &apos;ll let you
okay .
question one--polio vaccine .
which animal do you have to thank for that ?
is this really necessary ?
only if you want to use that stapler .
flipper babies .
what ? -flipper babies .
10,000 babies were born with birth defects in the 1950s
because their pregnant mothers took thalidomide ,
first developedon guinea pigs .
the guinea pigs didn &apos;t have any side effects.your point ?
my pointis that humans and animals
have different physiologies , they have different reactions .
they can have different reactions .
doesn &apos;t mean that they will .
tell that to those 10,000 babiesand their mothers .
so the polio vaccine--developed using mice and monkeys .
you can keep your stapler.it &apos;s not worth it .
give me the status on reggie and paddy .
reggie &apos;s fine . paddy &apos;spulse ox is low but stable .
and babe ? holding steady .
i thought we weren &apos;t supposed to give them names .
i could give them numbers , but then i &apos;d probably tell you
three needs antibiotics
and find you shoving a needle in grey &apos;s ass .
his vitals are getting worse.damn it
uh , did you check his lung again ?
i already took out an entire lobe .
what abou this descending aorta ?
you know what ? just can it , lexopedia
i &apos;ve tried everything .
pulseless . uh , that &apos;s it.we need to get more exposure .
you &apos;re opening him up more ?
i need everyone &apos;s help.stem to stern .
what--what if he can &apos;t take it ? you could--you could kill him .
don &apos;t get emotional .
just get ready to start massaging his heart . scalpel .
dr. bailey , can you dissect down anymore ?
there &apos;s nothing to dissect.there &apos;s barely any artery left .
what about if we extend the gore @-@ tex graft ?
no , what &apos;s left is too friable .
so we can &apos;t reconnect the organs to the vessels ?
not at this moment no
but if we can &apos;t reconnect the organs ,
they won &apos;t reperfuse and they &apos;ll just die
yes , they will .
is it too late for a transplant ?
well , we &apos;d have to find six good organs
in about eight hours .
it &apos;s too late for a transplant .
and a gold star for grey .
we could try to put in more gore @-@ tex .
oh , put even more synthetic material in her ?
what about a saphenous vein graft ?
no , she &apos;s already getting acidotic .
that sort of thing has to be preplanned
yeah , so what &apos;s your idea ?
excuse me ?
i mean , you &apos;re good at shooting down every idea we come up with
what &apos;s yours ?
it was my idea not to do this in the first place , dr. bailey .
yeah , you made that very clear every chance you got.shut up .
i don &apos;t care who had what idea when .
get over yourselves .
shut up and talk to each other .
what about ... using ... human umbilical vein ?
i mean , ready to go , already heparinized .
okay . i like it.erica , what do you think ?
it could work .
it &apos;s dr. bailey &apos;s call.if she wants to do it ...
i do .
in that case , let &apos;s do it .
nice work on the valve .
first developed in pigs , but more recently cows . moo .
are you done beating me up for the day ?
because i &apos;d like to go home .
i was just trying to teach you.you want to teach us ?
take us to the simulab with the plastic guys
who have heart rates and blood pressure
and croak when you nick an artery .
until you apply scalpel to skin , stevens ,
you &apos;re just going through the motions .
that attitude , that &apos;s from before .
we have the technology now .
we don &apos;t have to torture live creatures .
no , you don &apos;t get to accuse me of torture .
those animals felt no pain .
you don &apos;t know that.you don &apos;t know that .
you don &apos;t know what they felt .
you don &apos;t know how scared they were .
animals are sensitiveand intelligent creatures .
and that is not me being emotional ,
that is simply the truth .
you want me to learn from your methods ?
you want me to learn anything from you ?
then don &apos;t stab pigs in front of me
and tell me that the sky isn &apos;t blue .
you are torturing god &apos;s creatures
in an age where we have the technology
that no longer requires us to .
if you want to do that , go ahead ,
but don &apos;t tell me i &apos;m less of a doctor for walking away .
come on , wilbur , don &apos;t do this .
his heart &apos;s not filling .
no , uh , massage it with both hands ,
like a--like a heart sandwich .
okay.good , good .
there . right there.stupid. look at that .
the knife went through his diaphragm right into his spleen .
okay , um , hand me those clamps .
we &apos;ve got some blood pooling the lower left quadrant .
can anybody see where it &apos;s coming from ?
here . this graft .
satinsky clampsand 4 @-@ 0 prolene .
scissors .
we &apos;re waiting , dr. bailey .
okay , this thing &apos;scoming out .
still waiting , dr. bailey .
okay.suction. clear it out .
okay , release clamps .
hold on , hold on , hold on.right in here .
still nothing .
no pulsation .
come on . come on .
reperfusion complete .
heart &apos;s beating on its own .
all right .
all right .
everyone , hell of a job .
i &apos;ve known women to be upset
because they couldn &apos;t make it to the big finish .
never had anything to do with me .
usually something to dowith their anatomy .
the point is , i &apos;ve never known a woman to be upset
because she could take a curtain call .
you &apos;re a conundrum , torres .
erica cried this morning ...
in bed ... after sex .
that was a compliment ... for you .
the crying was a compliment .
it wasn &apos;t a compliment for me.she was--it was--
she was having a revelation.she was having ...
the sex is awesome with erica .
we &apos;ve reached awesome , which is ...
awesome .
yes , but it &apos;s also awesome with you .
so what &apos;s the problem ?
i guess i thought there should be a difference ...
between you and erica .
i mean , if i &apos;m ...
there should be a difference .
the difference between me and erica ...
is that i know you had sex with her 12 hours ago .
she doesn &apos;t know you had sex with me ,
and that makes you a cheater .
do you want to be a cheater ? because i &apos;m fine with it .
the question is , are you ?
i &apos;m gonna yell at the major general .
you want to come ?
hell yeah . be right there .
hey , torres .
hey .
hunt , can i talk to you ?
sure .
karev .
no , no , he can stay .
you want karev to hear how you screwed up the flap
on my head trauma , that &apos;s fine with me .
my job &apos;s to keep him alive . that &apos;s what i did .
no , what you did was almost maim a guy
for the rest of his life .
you &apos;re lucky i saved the blood supply .
so what would you have done ?
well , you got a man with a deep scalp wound
and two of the best surgeons in the country
standing 10 feet away from him .
i would &apos;ve asked those two surgeons to step in .
that &apos;s what i would &apos;ve done .
i mean medically .
what would you have done medically so i can do better ?
listen , i recognize there &apos;s different ways of doing things ,
even the basics .
over here , if someone appears dead , you go to them first .
in iraq , if someone appears dead , you don &apos;t go to them .
this is day one for me , so if you think
there &apos;s a better way , then tell me , and i &apos;ll listen .
again , both of you ,
great job .
thank you .
is there a problem , dr. bailey ?
i just find it hard to believe
you &apos;re accepting congratulations ,
considering you didn &apos;t want to do this operation in the first place .
and when you finally did do it ,
you fought me every step of the way .
and yet , you still had a world @-@ class heart surgeon
by your side .
you may be a fine surgeon--
god knows i know that--
but not today .
today you were a pain in the ass--
a nay @-@ saying , bullying , consistently negative pain in the ass .
at no point did you encourage me or do anything
to make me think this surgery could be anything but a failure .
and it wasn &apos;t just me .
you made it as hard as humanly possible for all of us .
so , yeah , we did do a nice job today .
we did a great job today , but that wasn &apos;t thanks to you .
that was thanks to me and the chief
and meredith grey
and anatomy jane .
babe is indestructible .
she lost a part of her liver and small bowel ,
but she &apos;s been doing fine .
we had to cross @-@ clamp wilbur &apos;s aorta and massage his heart .
i couldn &apos;t locate the source of his bleeding
until i found a hole in his diaphragm
and realized he had a splenic laceration .
he &apos;s a--he &apos;s a fighter . he &apos;s pulling through .
reggie had some oozing after his colon resection ,
but we packed it , and he &apos;s been stable ever since .
uh , paddy almost bled out
because his carotid was sliced right through ,
but we put in a graft , and he &apos;s been stable ever since .
he &apos;s good as new .
that &apos;s good .
that &apos;s great work , all of you .
so , uh , put them out
and make sure that you write up all your work .
what do you mean , &quot; put them out &quot; ?
terminate &apos; em . the pigs--kill &apos; em .
i &apos;m not killing those pigs .
i spent the entire day trying to keep them alive .
if you want them dead , you do it yourself .
you resected half of a liver today .
you repaired a diaphragm and did a splenectomy .
you grafted a severed artery
and repaired a lacerated bladder ,
performed a lobectomy .
and i understand you even removed a tumor .
on paddy . his thyroid .
do you have any idea how much you just learned ?
they &apos;d be in pain .
those are massive injuries , months of recovery .
to keep them alive after all that ,
that &apos;s not humane .
seriously , you don &apos;t remember my name ?
i remember your name , but that was before .
this last tour , i was on a forward surgical team .
we , uh ...
treated combat casualties in the field .
you &apos;re mostly just looking to do damage control--
sedate &apos; em , ventilate &apos; em ,
airlift &apos; em to baghdad , then get outta there .
only this one time , we didn &apos;t get out fast enough
because we ended up in the middle of an r.p.g. ambush .
there were 20 people in my unit , including me ,
and 19 died .
and then i got discharged .
so ... i &apos;m not there anymore , in the before .
i knew your name in the before .
but now i &apos;m living in the after .
erica--
you want to apologize to someone , apologize to bailey .
thanks to you , i made her life a living hell today .
i slept with mark sloan .
if that &apos;s your idea of an apology , you seriously--
shut up .
you--you were--you were crying
and--and--and seeing leaves .
and i wasn &apos;t .
okay ? i @-@ i may never see leaves .
or--or maybe i will see leaves , but i will also see flowers .
i might be a whole forest girl.i don &apos;t know yet .
but i @-@ i do know that i want to be with you ,
and to do that , i have to at least tell you the truth ,
and the truth is , i slept with mark sloan today .
okay .
twice , actually .
okay .
you paged ?
yeah , um , yeah . how &apos;s tori ?
oh , she &apos;s good . stable .
you weren &apos;t imagining things .
you used to run around here with that doll all the time .
took her everywhere--
the cafeteria , the o.r. gallery .
tori &apos;s got a whole army .
you didn &apos;t have anyone .
seeing anatomy jane ...
reminded me of how much i was to blame for that .
you &apos;re a living reminder of every failure in my life .
that &apos;s not your fault .
and if i thought i &apos;m sorry
would hold any meaning for you at all ,
i would say it .
i &apos;d say it a thousand times a day .
some wars are never over .
some end in an uneasy truce .
i can &apos;t do it .
i know i &apos;m supposed to , but ...
they &apos;ll suffer .
don &apos;t let them suffer .
so no more on call room , huh ?
afraid not .
that &apos;s , uh , that &apos;s too bad .
i guess i &apos;ll , uh , see you around .
you wanna get a drink ?
really ?
just because we &apos;re not sleeping together
doesn &apos;t mean we can &apos;t hang out , be friends .
you &apos;re good for more than sex , mark .
i would love to get a drink .
she &apos;s not gonna cry every time , right ?
no , no , no . that passes .
some wars result ...
in complete and total victory .
sit .
um , mac and cheese--
from the box , not the freezer .
some wars end with a peace offering .
i named the pigs today .
i &apos;m sorry , but i don &apos;t know what that means .
i take things personally .
i get too emotional .
there &apos;s no place for it at work ,
not--not with the pigs and not with you .
i &apos;m sorry .
this is so much better than the freezer kind .
i thought you were sleeping with michelle tonight .
or was it jackie ?
iz--
i &apos;ve had a hard day , alex , and a sad night .
so can you please just leave me alone ?
izzie--
what ?
i &apos;m not good at this , all right ?
i &apos;m not good at--at relationships
or talking about stupid feelings ,
and ... and you are ,
so maybe you could teach me or something , you know ?
tell me what i did wrong .
you don &apos;t want us to see other people .
you don &apos;t want us to see other people ,
and that &apos;s how you tried to tell me ...
by asking if it was cool
if you screwed michelle .
laughing is not helping .
i &apos;m sorry.i &apos;m sorry .
so you want lessons , huh ?
i want lessons .
mm @-@ hmm . okay .
you start with , isobel stevens ,
you are staggeringly good in bed .
you &apos;re amazing smart , wonderfully funny .
and you care about animals .
that &apos;s where i start ?
yeah . and then you say , you want to go steady with me ?
that &apos;s what i would say if it was 1952 .
alex .
you wanna go steady with me ?
mm , if that &apos;s what you want .
i mean , yeah , whatever .
and some wars ...
end in hope .
oh , look .
i wore this every day to elementary school .
nice . your mom make that for you ?
yeah , right . she probably got it
at the lost and found at the hospital .
mer , you should do this one .
is it more ugly hats ?
another diary ?
more than one .
but all these wars are nothing ...
oh , god .
compared to the most frightening war of all ...
