you think you can help me ?
we talked to your mum ,
and she said that there was a witness .
patrick molloy , he worked at the rec center .
that &apos;s where i was the afternoon mrs. johnson was killed .
i do want you to get better ,
but not for me but for yourself .
well , as long as i have you i can do that .
i do have you , right ?
yes , you do .
of course divorce is gonna cost a ton , so ...
how much ?
5,000 bucks .
good thing that &apos;s not your problem , huh ?
think anyone would notice
if we went upstairs for a little bit ?
i don &apos;t really think
this whole friends- with @-@ benefits thing is working out .
if you &apos;re gonna go around and tell everyone
we &apos;re like boyfriends ,
you should at least ask me out first .
i have some , uh , tax issues with the irs .
how bad is it ?
there &apos;s a lien on their house .
you mean they could lose their home ?
i don &apos;t understand .
how can there be a lien on our home ?
your dad &apos;s on the title , love .
that &apos;s how we got approved for the loan .
and plus the $ 200,000 that dana and i loaned you
for the down payment on the house .
uh , what about yours and dana &apos;s house , stewart ?
well , the irs doesn &apos;t go after the debtors &apos; primary residence .
but they &apos;ll come after ours ?
listen , i would be more than happy to sell our home ,
but we &apos;re already upside down on the mortgage .
how could you let this happen , daddy ?
well , we lost a lot of money
when the stock market crashed in &apos; 08,
and then that was the money we were supposed to retire on ,
and then we couldn &apos;t pay the income tax .
are we gonna lose our home ?
no ! no ! absolutely not .
okay , how much do you owe , stewart ?
well , it &apos;s , uh , not all that much .
um , i &apos;m meeting today with a tax lawyer
who , uh , specializes in negotiating with the irs .
i &apos;ll work something out . i promise , don &apos;t worry .
okay , well , uh ...
hi , grandpa .
how &apos;s my ... gorgeous girl ?
where &apos;s grams ?
she had to leave early .
she had to sub for a class for a colleague ,
but she said to say how sorry she was
and to give you all a big kiss good @-@ bye .
hey , take it easy , miss thing .
come on .
sorry .
i &apos;ve got a steam club meeting this morning .
what &apos;s steam ?
i thought it was stem ?
&quot; science , technology , engineering , arts ... &quot;
they just added that ... and ...
mistake .
i would have never agreed to joining your club
if i had known that i had to wake up this early .
you joined stem ... steam ?
jesus is helping us build a robot .
hey , did you guys every see that ...
the terminator movie ?
any day now computers are gonna take over the world .
they already have , grandpa .
well , i better get ready for my meeting .
so , uh ...
hasta la vista , babies .
i &apos;ll be back .
why do we have to go so early ?
i thought the down payment
your parents gave us for the house
was your early inheritance .
since when did it become a loan ?
since they need it back , i guess .
jesus , we got to go .
uh , mariana .
sweetheart , can i speak to you for a second
before you go , please ?
is there any reason that nick would be under the impression
that ... that you want to come and see him again ?
no , why ?
well , i just ... i got a call from his doctor ,
and , uh , apparently nick asked
when you were coming to visit him again .
well , i &apos;m not .
and why aren &apos;t his doctors doing their job ?
i mean , i can &apos;t be nick &apos;s only reason for living !
okay , no worries , love .
i &apos;ll take care of it .
all right ?
get to school , you guys , get to school .
so you &apos;re not gonna tell her about the hearing ?
well , you see how well that went .
can you imagine how she &apos;s gonna react if i tell her
that they &apos;re trying to get nick released from the hospital ?
have a good day . see you .
see you .
oh god .
what ? what ... what ?
what are you doing ?
your mom .
oh , god , she &apos;s coming over .
hey , b.
oh , hi , i didn &apos;t see you there .
i dropped my phone under the seat .
i hate it when that happens .
going surfing ?
oh , yeah .
i haven &apos;t been in a while .
yeah , surfing &apos;s like her , uh ... her therapy .
that &apos;s nice .
uh , brandon , the bell &apos;s about to ring .
uh , so have fun ,
and i will see you later .
so , mom tells me that you gave cortney money .
i loaned her money , yeah ,
but she &apos;s gonna pay me back .
well , in my experience ,
sometimes people can mistake a loan for a gift
and vice versa .
so how are you paying for food and parties ?
well , you know , i &apos;m still working at the smokehouse .
making a hundred bucks a week in tips .
look , mama , you don &apos;t have to worry .
i just hope that cortney &apos;s pulling her weight ,
not just catching waves .
do you want to do something later ?
can &apos;t . i have to work on my senior project .
oh , how &apos;s that going ?
you know , if you need my help , you can just ask me .
see , i &apos;m afraid you &apos;d just be a distraction .
i &apos;m never giving in !
watch out .
ah , sucker !
grow up ! what is wrong with them ?
they &apos;re seniors .
exactly .
they &apos;re playing water ninja .
it &apos;s a school tradition .
how have i been here for , like , a few weeks
and i know more about this than you do ?
didn &apos;t you get your email with your target &apos;s name ?
pass .
oh , so you &apos;re just too cool for school , huh ?
no , i &apos;m too cool for water balloon fights .
come on , callie , it &apos;s fun .
not everything has to be so serious .
there is no way i &apos;m passing this week &apos;s midterm .
maybe you should ask noah to tutor you .
what , is he like a math genius too ?
i wouldn &apos;t be surprised .
he &apos;s pretty smart .
so what &apos;s going on with you guys ?
we &apos;re just hanging out .
he &apos;s coming over after school .
oh , really ?
we &apos;re probably just friends .
probably ? it didn &apos;t look like &quot; just friends &quot;
at the dance floor of your mom &apos;s party .
you know one thing noah &apos;s not ?
a dancer .
his moves were a little experimental .
it &apos;s probably because he was stoned .
what ? no way .
uh , yeah , way .
it &apos;s always the preacher &apos;s kids you got to watch out for .
nick &apos;s doctors no longer feel
that he is a danger to himself ,
and since he has no criminal record
or history of delinquent behavior ,
we &apos;re asking that he be sent
to the mission bay home for delinquent boys
where he &apos;ll continue to receive psychiatric care and therapy
in a secure environment .
what about being a danger to others ?
and you are ?
your honor ,
my name is stefanie adams foster .
i was one of the police officers on @-@ site
during the lockdown at anchor beach
when nick stratos brought a gun to school .
allegedly ! no one ever saw my son with a gun at school .
your son broke into our house
and laid in wait for 24 hours
until he was able to get my daughter alone
and threatened her at gunpoint .
he never threatened to hurt your daughter !
mr. stratos ,
i &apos;d like to hear what officer adams @-@ foster has to say .
thank you , your honor .
um , nick stratos has only been
under psychiatric treatment for a couple of weeks ,
hardly enough time to determine
that he is not a threat to himself
or anyone else for that matter .
are you a doctor ?
your honor , this has been very difficult on my wife and me ,
but our son has been victimized
by a girl who is toying with his affections ,
and ms. adams @-@ foster ...
mrs.
right , mrs.
give my regards to your wife .
i will , thank you .
mrs. adams @-@ foster has no reason to feel
that my son is a threat to her daughter .
then why is he still asking to see mariana ?
what are you talking about ?
his doctors called me this morning ,
because nick apparently asked
when mariana was coming to visit him .
i &apos;m happy to get dr. stolland on the phone , your honor .
nick , is this true ?
yes .
i gave her a necklace with a diamond &quot; m &quot; on it ,
and i wanted to ask her if i could have it back
to give to my mom .
you know , &quot; m &quot; for mom .
i wanted to give her something special
for standing by me through this .
i understand i &apos;m not in a relationship with mariana any more
and why she doesn &apos;t want to see me .
i &apos;m not angry about it .
i &apos;m truly sorry for everything i did .
i just ...
want to get better
so that i can pay for my mistakes ...
and get on with my life .
just wanted to drop off
brandon &apos;s letter of recommendation for juilliard .
thank you so much , eric .
i haven &apos;t seen much of him around the music room lately .
i hope he &apos;s practicing .
he &apos;s got to put 120 percent into this .
he is . he &apos;s been practicing at home
and he even took the sats again
to improve on his score , which was already pretty high .
um , he &apos;s be better off focusing on his audition .
juilliard doesn &apos;t even require sat scores ,
unless the student &apos;s home @-@ schooled .
does brandon know that ?
yeah . i &apos;m pretty sure we talked about it .
anyway , i &apos;ll see you .
okay .
if i knew being a nerd was this fun ,
i would have converted much sooner .
it doesn &apos;t fit .
this is three millimeters from the edge you measured ?
uh , yeah , three millimeters
from the edge of the rod to the edge of the hole .
no , three millimeters from the edge of the rod
to the center of the hole .
that &apos;s useless . do it again .
right , this is very complex work
and any little error can cost us big time ,
so if you don &apos;t understand something ,
you need to ask for clarification .
got it .
hey , mariana .
i think we should get the omni wheels .
they can move in any direction
and they &apos;re cool as hell .
yeah , no , you &apos;ve seen the field .
we have to be able to make sure we can get over the obstacles .
it &apos;s not like omni wheels can &apos;t go straight ,
unless ... are you afraid you won &apos;t be able to drive it ?
i &apos;m happy to take over as driver if you want .
no thanks .
okay , but make sure that we have enough control .
i &apos;ll order them now .
um , why did you just back down ?
we have to pick our battles . it should be fine .
just let the boys have their toys .
should be fine ?
seriously ?
i can &apos;t deal with you second @-@ guessing me right now , okay ?
他们要把我转移到新的地方 来见我
hey , what was that about ? did she say something about me ?
hello .
what ?
what did emma say ?
look , i can &apos;t deal with your drama right now .
who are you texting ?
huh ? mariana !
just mind your own business ! okay ?
everything okay ?
who &apos;s home ?
uh , i don &apos;t think anyone yet .
why ? what &apos;s ... what &apos;s going on ?
i called coronado high .
your name &apos;s not on the list of students who took the sats .
uh , that ... that &apos;s weird .
maybe they forgot to log my name in or something .
and you realize that juilliard doesn &apos;t require sat scores ?
uh , yeah , well , you know , i mean , it wasn &apos;t
it wasn &apos;t going to be the only school i applied to .
did you take that test for yourself ?
or for someone else ?
why ... why would i ?
for money !
you realize what you &apos;ve done ?
you &apos;ve committed academic fraud !
the consequence of which is no juilliard ,
no college , period !
what ? do they know ?
i know !
and you have put me in a terrible position , brandon ,
because if i report this ,
which i am ethically and professionally required to do ,
i will be responsible
for completely destroying your future !
okay , i &apos;m sorry .
sorry &apos;s not gonna cut it , brandon !
first , everything with callie and now this ...
what is going on with you ?
cortney &apos;s ex is ... is suing for custody !
so she needs a lawyer .
she needs the money for a lawyer .
brandon , when you continue to justify your actions ,
it &apos;s a pretty clear sign
that you have lost your sense of right and wrong .
i can &apos;t even look at you right now .
so i looked into kyle &apos;s alibi witness ,
patrick molloy ,
and it turns out that he was arrested
for lewd and lascivious acts with a minor .
when was this ?
a couple months before kyle &apos;s trial .
so did he go to prison ?
no , the charges were dropped .
well , i did find something odd in the arrest report
that a lead detective on kyle &apos;s case ... detective gray ...
was called in to question patrick molloy
after he was arrested .
so ?
well , gray is in the homicide unit
and the molestation case belonged vice .
those guys are very territorial .
so , why would they do that ?
i have a theory .
oh , watch out for the wall !
sorry , i &apos;m kinda lame at this .
my mom doesn &apos;t like me to play video games .
she thinks they mess with your head .
oh my god , get that stuff away from me .
candy is totally my kryptonite .
what ? you &apos;ve got like the munchies ?
you stoned ?
taylor told me you were high at my mom &apos;s birthday party .
oh ! yeah .
i mean , no .
no , i &apos;m not high right now ,
but yeah , i ... i have a medical marijuana card .
how ? you &apos;re fifteen .
my mom got it for me .
the same mom who &apos;s afraid
video games will mess with your head ?
it &apos;s for my anxiety .
i get nervous around large crowds , and new people .
i guess she &apos;d rather me have something natural
rather than a prescription drug or something .
have you ever tried it ?
uh , no .
do you want to ?
wh ... do you mean right now ?
no . no , i don &apos;t ...
i don &apos;t have any on me right now .
my mom limits how much i get ,
but i , uh ... i save some for ...
fun .
if you want , i can bring it over tomorrow .
yeah , sure , cool .
so this detective gray
would put a child molester back on the streets
just to make sure that kyle was convicted
of mrs. johnson &apos;s murder ?
yeah , it &apos;s horrible ,
but my mom said that detectives
are under so much pressure to close their cases ,
and some of them are just willing to do whatever it takes .
and molloy will never admit that he made a deal ,
because if he did , he could still be charged .
yeah , and possibly go to jail .
so we &apos;re back to where we started
with no alibi witness for kyle .
which is why i went to sheila &apos;s this afternoon
to pick up all of kyle &apos;s case files .
my mom told me
i &apos;m not supposed to be like detectiving or anything ,
but she never said we couldn &apos;t do this .
i &apos;ve never seen my mom so mad .
god , this is all my fault .
no , it &apos;s not .
it was my choice to take that test .
i just wish i hadn &apos;t .
what &apos;s this ?
it &apos;s 900 bucks .
i know it &apos;s just a dent in what i owe you ,
but i &apos;m paying every penny back .
where did you get this ?
i sold my surfboarding gear .
cort , you love surfing .
you can &apos;t be the only one making sacrifices , brandon .
we &apos;re gonna get through all of this , okay ?
together .
i , uh , spoke to your mother today .
she called you ?
no , i called her .
your dad has not exactly been telling us the truth , lena .
according to my mother ,
who just abandoned him here as soon as things got rough .
she didn &apos;t abandon him .
she went home , and it &apos;s a good thing she did
because she was able to go through their financial records .
well , i &apos;m sure she &apos;s making it seem a lot worse
than it really is .
he owes the irs almost $ 300,000 , lena .
how is that even possible ?
well , he lost money in the stock market ,
but then he tried to recoup it ,
making a lot of bad , high @-@ risk investments ,
and they &apos;re upside down on the house
because he took out a second and third mortgage .
he hasn &apos;t paid his income taxes in four years .
i mean ...
it &apos;s as if he &apos;s ...
he kept doubling down on these get @-@ rich @-@ quick schemes ...
okay ! enough !
my father &apos;s made some mistakes ,
but i don &apos;t appreciate you calling my mother
and ganging up on him .
he needs our support .
he has to go home and face his wife
and their financial situation .
and we need to figure out how to save our house .
well , i &apos;m not gonna tell him he has to leave .
you and my mother can doubt him all you want ,
but he &apos;s always come through for us .
so if he says he &apos;s gonna fix this , i believe him .
what &apos;s that ?
this is the forensics report .
oh , no , i mean ... that .
oh , that is the school project that won &apos;t die .
um , i had this idea to do it on all the foster homes
that my little brother and i were in ,
but right now it just seems lame .
why ?
i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s just not important .
okay , so this forensics report is really disturbing .
&quot; mrs. johnson was found in her living room ,
face down in a pool of blood .
&quot; she was bludgeoned in the back of the head with a garden axe . &quot;
there &apos;s no sign of forced entry ,
and kyle &apos;s dna all over the murder weapon .
okay , but kyle did yard work for her , right ?
so wouldn &apos;t his dna be all over the gardening tools anyway ?
yeah .
wait .
it &apos;s missing a page .
look , it goes right from page six of eight
to eight of eight . where is page seven ?
that is a good question .
what &apos;s going on ?
this is aaron .
he &apos;s helping me look through kyle &apos;s case files .
you &apos;re supposed to working on your senior project .
yeah , actually , um , i was thinking of maybe changing it
to be about kyle &apos;s case ,
like juvenile justice .
no , callie , you &apos;re not changing your project again !
why not ?
because you &apos;ve already changed it three times !
there &apos;s a reason you wanted
to do seven homes in seven years ,
one that made a lot of sense to mom and me .
aaron , i &apos;m sorry ,
i &apos;m gonna have to ask you to leave .
callie has to focus on her school work .
can i take that ?
yeah .
nice to meet you .
yeah , you too .
well , that was rude .
i am sorry you feel that way ,
but we think that it &apos;s time you commit to this project ,
and that you commit to the family ,
as a matter of fact .
so how about you stop making excuses
and get it done !
cool , right ?
yeah , it &apos;s cool , but , uh ,
why are we doing swerve drive ?
sorry , my bad .
you &apos;ve seen the field .
there &apos;s no way those omni wheels
are gonna be able to get over those obstacles .
we talked about this .
simple is better .
yeah , no , you &apos;re right .
we &apos;ll swap them out .
we can &apos;t afford to make mistakes like this , mariana .
if we do , we &apos;re never gonna be ready in time .
okay , so i &apos;ll take care of getting the new wheels ,
but we have to make up for some lost time ,
so you should probably start coding
for basic drive ...
and then we &apos;ll upload it whenever the new wheels get in .
okay .
oh , and thanks for hanging me out to dry with craig .
hey , you &apos;re the team leader .
you &apos;re right . i am .
hey , can you give me a ride ?
what &apos;s up ? everything good ?
yeah , yeah , i &apos;m ... i &apos;m fine .
uh , we miss you .
miss you too .
hey , what &apos;s up with that ... that new guy ?
is he , uh ...
no . i &apos;m not sure yet .
gotcha .
you ever done pot ?
well , i mean , are you wearing like a wire or something ?
no .
i did it once . yeah .
but ... why ? are you thinking of trying it ?
no , no ! i ... i , um ...
you know , i just heard some other kids talking about it
and i was wondering what it was like .
i didn &apos;t like it .
i ... i kind of just got paranoid ,
and my head kept jumping from one thought to the next .
it was like an acid trip or something like that .
that was a bad example .
actually , i &apos;ve never done acid .
don &apos;t do acid .
i don &apos;t know , i ... i kind of panicked
and had to call mama to come pick me up .
you did ? was she mad ?
no , actually , she was ... really cool ,
but ... i felt pretty stupid .
you know what ? i &apos;m gonna catch you later . okay ?
hey , man . hey .
what &apos;s up , bro ?
uh , we got to talk .
so ...
when you asked for a ride home ,
i sort of thought maybe you wanted ...
no .
no , sorry , just a ride .
you know what i don &apos;t get ?
what teenage boy gives up no @-@ strings @-@ attached sex ?
what does it matter ?
can &apos;t you get your benefits from some other friend ?
yeah , i can .
i can get all the benefits i want ,
any time i want from any friend too .
good , then what do you need me for ?
i mean , you don &apos;t think i &apos;m good enough for you anyway .
why would you say that ?
i think you know .
actually , i &apos;m pretty sure i don &apos;t !
you think i &apos;m dumb , emma .
why do you ...
i don &apos;t think you &apos;re dumb .
come on !
we both know that i &apos;m not smart enough for you ,
and that &apos;s why you won &apos;t date me .
the reason i won &apos;t date you is because ...
you broke my heart .
no , you broke up with me .
because i didn &apos;t think you were ...
into me .
you know that &apos;s not true .
then why did you immediately start hooking up with hayley
like two seconds after it was over with us ?
hayley was a mistake .
i only got with her ,
because i thought that you didn &apos;t want me .
well , that sucks big time .
well , i &apos;m sorry !
so ... do you think maybe i ...
that i could unbreak your heart ?
is that mariana ?
is that what we &apos;re doing here ?
following her ?
oh my god !
what the hell is she doing ?
i was thinking about you today .
i saw this vine of this guy
who ate like 1,000 pounds of candy .
oh , yeah , funny .
so i made a playlist
of some music i like to chill with .
yeah , so ...
listen , i ...
i don &apos;t think i &apos;m really ready to smoke pot .
uh , uh , okay .
the thing is we &apos;re not smoking it .
we &apos;re eating it .
hey , mama .
hey , um ...
so i just wanted to let you know
that i &apos;m ... i &apos;m making this whole sat @-@ thing right .
i gave the money back to the kid
that i took the test for
and i &apos;m making him take it himself ,
and to use whatever score he gets .
that way , you know , you don &apos;t have to
compromise your integrity or anything .
okay .
uh , i mean .
i ... i thought you &apos;d be happy
that i &apos;m fixing this .
like you fixed things
buying back those fake id &apos;s you made ?
it &apos;s the fact that you did these things at all ,
brandon , that concerns me .
a character is much easier kept than recovered .
i hope you remember that next time .
the universe is collapsing
on itself .
stephen hawking ?
the smartest man in the world ?
no ?
dude !
did you just call me jude ?
no , that &apos;s my name .
yeah , that &apos;s why i thought it was weird .
no , but i just wanted to tell you
that i can feel my bones ,
like , inside my skin .
hey , doors open please .
dinner &apos;s almost ready .
noah , you are welcome to join us if you &apos;d like .
oh , thank you , but i got to get home .
okay .
what is this ?
don &apos;t ruin your appetite before dinner , please .
do you think she knew ?
no , we &apos;re cool .
but , man , you never told me your mom was the po @-@ po .
po @-@ po ?
hey , daddy .
hey , so ,
i think i found a solution to our problems .
well , great , what &apos;s the plan ?
well , it &apos;s more of an opportunity , really .
see , if we can just scrape together $ 20,000,
we could buy shares in this company
that is about to announce that it has developed
an affordable technique
to desalinate sea water using solar power .
now within the next few months ,
they are projecting 10
to 20 times the return on their investment .
i could pay off the irs
and then even your line of credit loan on the house ,
and then ...
the lien goes away .
um , daddy , that sounds pretty risky .
it &apos;s a no @-@ brainer .
i mean , water is the new oil .
i mean , trust me on this , honey .
this is the answer to our problems .
dad .
we know how much you owe the irs .
you &apos;ve been talking to your mother .
yes , we ... we called her ...
and we know everything .
we know about the second and third mortgages ...
and we know about
all the get @-@ rich @-@ quick schemes .
yeah , well , this is different .
this is different . i am right about this .
we can &apos;t afford for you to be wrong again .
you are making a mistake here , honey !
no , no , you &apos;ve made mistakes , dad !
you &apos;ve lost everything and you &apos;re in denial about it .
stewart , you keep dodging the irs ,
you &apos;re gonna end up in jail .
i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m gonna do .
i still have my life insurance .
i could probably drive off a cliff .
you &apos;d all be okay .
daddy , don &apos;t say that .
don &apos;t ever say that .
we would never be okay without you .
all i ever wanted was to take care of my family .
i know .
i know .
was it something i said ?
don &apos;t even think about it .
dinner &apos;s gonna be ready soon .
come on , i &apos;m starving .
then eat a veggie , here .
uh , potato chips are technically a vegetable .
you know what , young man ?
hey , sweets .
um , can i talk to you about nick ?
uh , should i go ?
no , no , no , you need to hear this too .
nick has been released from the hospital ,
and has been moved to a group home for boys .
is he okay , mentally ?
that remains to be seen ,
but according to the doctors
and the judge who approved the move ,
they seemed to think so .
he is still under lock and key .
he has no access to phones or computers ,
and i have made it quite clear to them
that he is not to contact either one of you ,
but if he does , you need to let me know .
okay .
all right , and i &apos;m gonna be closely monitoring his detention
and activities , so there &apos;s no need for you to worry at all .
i &apos;m not worried .
it &apos;s like the most depressing scrapbook ever .
this was a horrible idea . no one &apos;s gonna want to see this .
i don &apos;t want to see this .
i hate that this is my story .
i just want to pretend it never happened .
but you can &apos;t .
look , it &apos;s hard to look back on the rough stuff .
i mean , i &apos;m transgender , i get it .
when i see pictures before my transition ...
i see how sad i was .
i just wanted to erase the first 16 years of my life ,
but you can &apos;t let go of all that pain and sadness
when you lock it in .
this little girl you keep pushing away ,
she &apos;s still here ,
and she needs to know that you love her ,
you &apos;ve got her back .
you can &apos;t save yourself without saving her .
and you can &apos;t do that until you face the fact
that you just got a really raw deal .
it sucks .
i know .
i have a friend who &apos;s transgender .
really ? you &apos;re giving me
the , uh , &quot; i have a friend &quot; speech ?
you know , we don &apos;t all know each other , right ?
i know that .
i didn &apos;t ...
his name &apos;s cole .
oh , wow , well , actually , i , uh ... i do know cole .
he &apos;s a great guy .
sorry , i didn &apos;t even ask you why you &apos;re here .
oh , uh , one of the lawyers from the jjc
got the police to send over the missing fax page .
and ?
nothing remarkable :
blood spatter analysis and stuff about the murder weapon ,
angle and direction of impact ,
probable height and weight of the killer ...
nothing really useful .
the missing page was probably just an oversight .
so we &apos;re probably just wasting our time .
why did you lie to mom ?
lie about what ?
emma and i followed you after school today .
are you serious ?
i can &apos;t believe you did that !
yeah , and i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re still seeing nick !
are you sure you &apos;re not the one who &apos;s crazy ?
keep your voice down .
look ...
when i went to go see nick at the hospital ,
he told me that i was the only reason he didn &apos;t kill himself ,
that i was his only reason for living .
so ?
so !
every time he gets to a phone ,
he texts me that he can &apos;t go on without me ,
and that if he didn &apos;t have me ,
he &apos;d like end it all right now .
i couldn &apos;t tell him it was over .
not yet .
he just ...
needs some time to get better .
and what does it matter if he thinks
that i &apos;m his girlfriend as long as he &apos;s locked up .
dad should be back home by now .
hope dana lets him in the house .
i think we &apos;re gonna have to help them
get out from under this .
i don &apos;t think my dad can do it alone .
you saw how broken he is .
i &apos;m not sure what we can do .
still nervous for the midterm ?
nah , i &apos;m all good .
you wrote the code in labview ?
yeah , and ?
no one on the team knows labview .
so what ?
so what if we have to change something ?
well , then i &apos;ll change it .
and what if you &apos;re not there ?
or what if we have to ask one of the other teams for help ?
what &apos;s the big deal ?
you should have done it in java or c + + .
well , too late .
no , it &apos;s not too late . do it over .
i &apos;m not doing it over .
look , you said we &apos;re behind anyways ,
you know , &apos; cause you made the wrong call on the omni wheels .
do it again in java .
why &apos;re you being such a bitch ?
because bitches get things done .
do it in java or you &apos;re off the team .
you know what ?
code it yourself .
i &apos;m out . who &apos;s with me ?
what ? what was that for ?
you have just been water ninja &apos;ed .
i &apos;m your target ?
no , no , i just wanted to prove to you that i can be fun .
it &apos;s a good shot , right ?
yeah , and with your left hand too ,
it &apos;s pretty good .
oh , you are so gonna get it .
i hope so .
i &apos;ll see you later ?
not if i see you first .
hey , aaron , it &apos;s callie .
i think i might know why the prosecutor
didn &apos;t want kyle &apos;s lawyer to see the forensics report .
it says that the killer was right @-@ handed ,
but kyle &apos;s not . he &apos;s left @-@ handed .
well , you have a lovely home ,
and there is a huge demand for craftsmans in san diego .
i don &apos;t think you &apos;ll have any trouble selling your house .
i &apos;d love the opportunity to be your realtor .
