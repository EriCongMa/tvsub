what in the hell is around your neck ?
this ? it &apos;s a crystal charm , man .
yeah , the guys at work gave it to me .
why ?
technically , it &apos;s &quot; hazing , &quot;
but , uh , i secretly love it .
that is the kind of crystal that should only rest
between a set of old bosoms .
did that sound just come from your body ?
whoa , how long you two been here ?
when was the last time you asked me that ?
last thursday .
so , at least thursday .
what kind of lazy ... holes ...
don &apos;t you know what -ing day it is ?
for crying out l ...
glen , you should see a doctor .
my name is schmidt .
i can &apos;t afford to miss work .
i &apos;m sorry , glen , but i &apos;m with kai on this one .
thanks , wilfred .
you ain &apos;t good with names .
oh , honey , you &apos;re all turned around .
no , you are .
i think you are .
stop .
i think you are . i &apos;m gonna get you ...
i &apos;ve done some research .
oh , ooh , how about a head &apos;s up , man ?
have i seen those glasses before ?
i feel like i want to remember them .
i got these in seventh grade , and i love them .
stop asking questions .
all right , check it .
so nerd coach went to the library ,
and some place that actually exists
called the hall of documents .
the downtown branch ?
mm @-@ hmm .
how &apos;s kathleen &apos;s eye ?
oh , kathleen &apos;s dead .
what ?
yeah .
so , check it out , guys , this is all research .
you two don &apos;t have to date in secret anymore at school .
yeah , it &apos;s all here in the lipinski v.
platte county unified school district .
precedence for days !
wow . wow , you did this for us .
no .
i just want to pat it .
i just want to , like , frickin &apos; pat it .
i want to nurse it .
yeah , i want to provide it with milk .
i used to be the hot teacher .
now you know how i felt when you turned up .
a miserable path awaits you .
so you want us to come out ,
so that you can go back to hooking up
with all the hot teachers ?
very much so .
but i &apos;m thinking about you guys , too .
i mean , wouldn &apos;t it be better
if you didn &apos;t have to hide your relationship ?
yeah , you know what ?
i think we should do this .
i ... we should do this , let &apos;s stop hiding .
yeah .
but , jess , will this make things tricky for your work
and will it in turn make you distracted and preoccupied
during our splishy @-@ splashy ?
no , no , of course not . i won &apos;t let it .
then let &apos;s do this .
yeah , let &apos;s .
yes ! we are coming out !
cracking . i &apos;m chuffed .
dude , i do not get you .
i trust you , miss day .
mostly because i do not want to read this .
that &apos;s great !
i &apos;m the easy one , dawg .
seriously , it &apos;s the teachers you need to worry about .
especially you .
you tend to care what people think about you .
that &apos;s like saying a penguin &quot; tends &quot; to be cute .
it &apos;s all it does , bro .
so , good luck
when the teachers present their field trip proposals .
if they catch a whiff of favoritism ,
they are going to tear you apart like ...
like a beautiful baguette , you know what i mean ?
when you @-@ you &apos;re having dinner ,
and you just suddenly say , &quot; hey , forget the bread knife .
let &apos;s just rip into this with our bare hands . &quot;
ah , i love that .
hey , what &apos;d they say ? what do you got ?
you can tell me , i can take it .
i @-@ i don &apos;t know if i can take it if ...
if you died , i &apos;d be lost .
j @-@ just tell me , i &apos;ll be there for you ,
i &apos;m big and strong .
is it cancer ?
what &apos;s your problem ?
oh , schmidty , you have cancer ?
i can &apos;t watch you go
through cancer , buddy , you &apos;re not strong enough .
what is wrong with you ? !
your friend keeps forgetting
his ulcer medication .
ulcer medication ?
he &apos;s lying , please .
take him home , make sure he does nothing all day .
look , i &apos;m not doing nothing all day .
can &apos;t take days off wor ...
my firm is wooing red potatoes , and i want that account .
don &apos;t listen to that aggressive male nurse .
wearing the same shoes as an old russian woman .
it &apos;s not an ulcer , he &apos;s ly ...
yeah , that &apos;s your ulcer telling you to stop being a dick .
before we begin our presentations ,
in the spirit of full disclosure and transparency ,
i have something to tell you .
mr. geauxinue and i are dating .
no , n @-@ n @-@ n @-@ no .
no , i just felt someone pass over my grave .
right .
i don &apos;t see a ring .
this is a total joke .
oh , you &apos;re joking .
there &apos;s none scenarios that this is possible .
ladies , i know you &apos;re upset ,
but you know what i do when i &apos;m upset ?
i hook up with me .
but i want to assure you
that this will not affect my judgment as vice principal .
let &apos;s hear those field trip proposals !
where are we gonna take those kids , guys ? !
and you know what makes the water delicious ?
taking the poop out .
hello , water treatment plant .
okay , we &apos;re off to a rocky start .

on an interactive nature &quot; experience . &quot;
very hands @-@ on .
with , uh ,

&quot; foil @-@ iag @-@ ee ... &quot;
not bad . um , i &apos;d be a lot more into it
if you could pronounce &quot; foliage . &quot;
i messed it up !
i can &apos;t do anything !
so i &apos;ve arranged for our students to speak
to astronauts at the space station ,
uh , via russian translator .
and , as an added surprise ,
actually get to operate the mars rover .
you see , this is
&quot; mission to mars : field trip to another world . &quot;
okay , then .
well , you all had great presentations ,
but i &apos;m sure no one can accuse me of favoritism
when i choose mr. g &apos;s proposal ,
which was so , so , so clearly the best one .
what does space have ?
you can &apos;t even walk on the ground .
you obviously picked it because he &apos;s your frickin &apos; boyfriend .
well ...
i see how it is .
my butt isn &apos;t cute enough . should i call my ma
and blame her for passing on her wide flat ass ?
hello , ma ?
i &apos;m not calling about that .
just listen .
i said , just listen .
it &apos;s about my butt .

i confiscated three laptops ,
two tablets and an e @-@ reader .

my earthquake kit ?

my dad makes cheese .
he just made me realize that i want guys
who have , like , frickin &apos; feelings and stuff .
yeah , well ...
but the boy looks like he was raised in a muffin .
i &apos;ve been holding office hours all year ,
and this is the first time anyone &apos;s taken me up on it .
ryan took you up on it , didn &apos;t he ?
this is gonna be fine
and , um , i &apos;m going to address
all of your problems one by one .
it just ain &apos;t right .
okay . &quot; ain &apos;t ... right . &quot;
anything else ?
it &apos;s not okay .
&quot; not ... okay . &quot;

i &apos;m not all right with it .
and when you lent me that sweater last week ,

ruth !
it &apos;s unscrupulous , ms. day .
if you two are coming out , we are , too .
meet my boyfriend .
so you like ... teachers ?
i &apos;d do whatever it takes
to get my foliage trip off the ground .
and now i know
how things work around here .
you &apos;re not even my type , just so you know .
don &apos;t do that .
i &apos;d be way more into this
if you had , like , a classic latin build .
okay , stop . stop !
&apos;cause i &apos;m a ginger ?

ms. day !
okay !
i changed my mind .
we &apos;re gonna look at foliage .

i feel terrible .
this is my fault .
jess , maybe i should look for another job .
no ! no ! absolutely not .
no , look , i have everything under control .
i am 100 % confident
that i &apos;m making the right decision .
you got girl troubles , get a crystal .
look , i &apos;m telling you , coach ,
women have been checking me out all day .
from the gentleman across the bar .
this is my favorite drink .
how did he ... ?
something powerful told me it was .
now , they gave me this crystal to help me on the streets ,
but i &apos;m starting to think
it &apos;s gonna help me in the sheets .
winston , look at me .
and i have never been more serious
about anything in my life .
okay .
stop rhyming .
all the timing ?
i don &apos;t need a crystal ,
i just need to be more frickin &apos; sensitive ,
so stop trying to give me your crystal !
okay . i &apos;m not supposed to be yelling .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m ...
i need to be working ... i need to work on that .
i &apos;m telling you , man ,
this crystal gives you the courage
to do the one thing that you &apos;re scared of the most .
to me , it &apos;s country music line dancing .
well , that is terrifying .
don &apos;t do that .
you guys seen schmidt ?
what the hell ?
my word processor ?
you can &apos;t kathy bates me forever !
my work needs me . gina needs me .
i &apos;m sorry , but she &apos;s trying to kill you ,
and i &apos;m trying everything in my power to stop her .
no , you &apos;re trying to turn me into you .
aren &apos;t you bored , nick ?
i &apos;ve been doing nothing for exactly one day ,
and i already feel pathetic .
the nick that i met
in college would not be happy living like this .
you &apos;ve changed .
that &apos;s not true .
i &apos;ve always been lazy .
physically , yes .
but mentally ,
you used to be like a da vinci in tie @-@ dye .
well , i &apos;ll be .
think differently .
the beer teat !
awesome , bro . ha !
party !
well , you changed , too .
you used to live by your own rules .
you were like a fat ,
jewish dennis rodman .
but look at you now .
you &apos;re like the back of a horse in a two @-@ person horse costume
with gina just farting in your face all day long .
that actually happened .
what ? !
schmidt , tell me ,
what do you get for all your hard work ?
the sponge account .
oh , great !
god willing , it &apos;ll get me red potatoes , too .
sexiest starch since jasmine rice .
great .
i hope your work keeps making you walk around
with your guts in a rusty old wagon .
oh , hey , nick . you &apos;re up early .
before noon .
oh , wait , is this sleepwalk nick ?
man , i love sleepwalk nick .
he always pays back the money that awake nick borrows from me .
of course i &apos;m up ! i &apos;m doing stuff .
i do stuff . i clean .
i &apos;m cooking right now . i &apos;m cooking breakfast .
sun &apos;s up , miller &apos;s up . people say that .
oh , hey , coach .
you &apos;re dressed like ryan .
what ?
no , you see , i @-@ i ... i &apos;ve had these clothes for forever ,
i just don &apos;t wear them when you &apos;re around .
you are dressed like ryan !
are you around me all the time ? no .
dressing up like someone else isn &apos;t going to work .
unlike this crystal .
shut up .
and i am never taking this crystal off .
well , i mean , except if i &apos;m making a tomato sauce
and the crystal keeps dipping in the tomato sauce .
then i &apos;ll take it off , and that &apos;s just being practical .
i don &apos;t know too much about crystal care , but ,
oh , i intend to find out .
see ?
i made the right decision .
kids need to be in nature .
emily kopnik saw a butterfly
and she said , &quot; oh , my god ,
country lice can fly . &quot;
oh , cool .
well , i &apos;m sensitive and i care about things like that .
you like leaves , eddie ?
no .
me , too , buddy . me , too .
so rake &apos; em
into a observational mound-- or &quot; a pile &quot; --
and then we transfer the piles
into one of these special research bags
which you kids can take home .
what &apos;s happening here ?
here &apos;s another rake .
you &apos;re not just having the kids , uh ,
rake the leaves and put them in a bag ,
are you ?
what now ?
i mean , uh , what else do you have planned ?
oh , don &apos;t worry about it .
i &apos;m a biology professional .
so , how &apos;s that phantom ulcer treating you ?
i sent you those q4 reports ...
horrible burning !
well , i &apos;m glad you &apos;re back .
see ? look how glad i am .
gina , let me run point on red potatoes .
i &apos;ve got three pitches
already ready to rock .
here &apos;s a taste .
that &apos;s the first one .
that &apos;s the first pitch . &quot; here &apos;s a taste . &quot;
it &apos;s just a picture of a red potato ,
and the tagline is : &quot; here &apos;s a ... here &apos;s a taste . &quot;
there &apos;s that new york sense of humor again , schmidt .
come on , gina . give me a shot at red potatoes .
no way , &apos; cause i need you .
you &apos;re the best sort of
mid @-@ level employee i &apos;ve ever had .

and i &apos;m gonna keep you right here ,
right by my side , where i can find you .

might need you to suit up
for my son &apos;s birthday this saturday , so ...

keep your phone on , okay ?
you know , sometimes i think about life ,
and it just makes me want to cry .
respond to my sharing , please .
you &apos;re putting on a real creepy , murdery vibe today .
just fyi .
i &apos;m not trying to do that . i was ...
just , like , going forward in your day ,
you should know that .
just trying to be , like , feeling ...
hey , guys .
hi .
what &apos;s going on ?
i think they might just be doing frickin &apos; yard work .
* i don &apos;t know what i been told *
* i don &apos;t know what i been told *
* foster &apos;s butt is mighty old *
* foster &apos;s butt is mighty old *
oh , we are violating every child labor law .
they &apos;re really good singers .
keep up the rhythm . mama won &apos;t be happy
till you clear the back forty .
biology teacher ?
is this your house ?
did you bring the kids here to work ?
first of all , my name is lorenzo .
secondly , yes .
but you &apos;re the one who picked my trip ,
so it &apos;s your fault .
can i have some water ?
okay , guys , stop working .
don &apos;t listen to her . keep working .
you don &apos;t have to work . i &apos;m the vice principal .

oh , my god . oh , my god , they &apos;re getting in my eyes .
damn you bees !
ah ! they got me !
ah , screw it .
here comes me .
i sting , too , bees .
bees don &apos;t bother me .
seems like it was a great field trip .
so sorry i missed it .
i feel like a bunch of tiny people
are holding tiny little lighters to my face .
today was a complete and total disaster ,
from start to finish .
i &apos;ve never failed so hard at my job ever in my life .
everyone &apos;s so mad at me , but i was just trying
to make them happy .
jess , you can &apos;t make everyone happy .
you don &apos;t need them to like you .
you just need them to listen to you .
you &apos;re the boss .
yeah .
i mean , if you were a man dating someone at work ,
do you think that you would be worried
about what everyone else was thinking ?
you &apos;d be , like , in the conference room ,
like , &quot; meeting adjourned .
except for you , sheila . &quot;
but that &apos;s not me .
i care what people think . i always have .
then your only option is to go in and be yourself .
just got to own it .
i think i &apos;m a little scared .
well , that &apos;s very interesting . you see ...
have you been here this whole time ?
the entire time .
that is why god ...
made crystals .
why did he make that shirt ?
hey , look , nick , i got to talk to you .
i got to talk to you .
you go first .
you go first .
okay , you know what ? you were right , nick .
i am a corporate monkey .
i don &apos;t want to be an old man
looking back on a meager life of ...
selling red potatoes for the man .
i don &apos;t want to be a lazy bum my whole life .
i want to be the kind of bum that other bums look at
and say , &quot; what &apos;s that bum smiling about ? &quot;
i get that .
i just had an idea , schmidt .
i just had an idea , too , but i feel like it &apos;s stupid .
yeah , i feel like mine &apos;s stupid .
let &apos;s do it . i &apos;m gonna ...
i &apos; m just gonna ...
i &apos;m gonna go to the kitchen .
no , but i want to hear what you have to say .
it &apos;s important to me-- &apos; cause maybe it &apos;s the same thing ,
maybe it &apos;s different .
it might be the same thing ,
so maybe we should just say it .
you want to do the classic on 11 ?
yeah , okay , great .

let &apos;s stay away from robots .
okay .
yeah ? all right .

hair that looks like a helmet . or vice versa--
helmet that looks like a hair is actually pretty smart .
oh , i &apos;m really hot right now .
a water bottle with the top cut off .
that &apos;s a cup !
that is just a cup . scratch it .

yeah .
i &apos;m not even joking .
you look so ugly right now .

look , i &apos;m not some little sensitive british guy , okay ?
i am coach .
but right now , i am in so much pain
that i am losing my mind .
and i might never recover .
so say hello to the new me ,
who &apos;s basically a street lunatic with a face made of fire !
they sting you in your pants ?
yeah , they ... they stung my doodad .
i &apos;m gonna get you some lotion .
everyone , um , before we begin this meeting ,
i just want to say that ... yes , ryan is my boyfriend .
and yes , i let it affect my job
because i care what you think of me , and i always have .
but here &apos;s what you should know :
i love my job , and i love this man right here .
i &apos;ve been waiting for a moment to tell you that ,
and i guess ...
this is it .
this is perfect .
and , um , just for the record , i love you , too .
this speech is wonderful , so please keep going .
oh , yeah . um , and you can come to me with any problems
or anything you want to ask me ,
but i &apos;m gonna make some decisions that you don &apos;t like ,
and you &apos;re just gonna have to deal with it .
so , uh , let &apos;s get back to work , okay ?
so is that the end of the meeting , then ?
yep . uh ... yeah , i got a little carried away
with the moment there .
anyway ...
put it on .
are you serious ?
yes . put the crystal on .
and ... there we go .
it &apos;s not gonna do anything .
