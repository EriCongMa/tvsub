get the birthday candle ready , &apos; cause ...
here comes chestnut &apos;s carrot cake !
i know we want this to be special ,
but chestnut is a horse .
any day he &apos;s not being made into an ikea meatball
is a birthday .
and remember , even though it &apos;s his tenth birthday ,
we have to pretend he &apos;s six
or he &apos;ll be in a bad mood all week .
surprise !
happy birthday , chestnut !
max ! he was supposed to do that !
what ? i know what he wished for .
that one day , he and i live in a world
where our love is recognized
and we have the same rights as gay couples .
there you go , baby .
hey , look , his shoe just fell off .
or maybe he kicked it off
&apos;cause he &apos;s getting ready to partay .
what are we gonna do ?
we don &apos;t have any money .
i wanted a massage last week ,
so i just sat next to someone on the bus
who looked like he &apos;d touch me .
i may have an idea how we can get &apos; em .
a guy i picked up at oktoberfest is a blacksmith .
at least i think he was .
i remember a leather apron
and something being heated in a fire .
well , i found my blacksmith .
he now shares an artisan barn
with a lady who makes clothing out of bees .
i guess that &apos;s why our cupcake shop didn &apos;t work .
we weren &apos;t providing a service that everyone needs .
i looked at our boy ,
and not only does chestnut need four new shoes ,
he has a hoof fungus .
a hoof fungus ? that &apos;s so ghetto .
i &apos;m pretty sure he got it from me
because we shower together .
and the cost of new shoes and vet fee ? $ 1,400 .
max , i feel awful .
i &apos;m a bad mother .
you &apos;re not a bad mother .
i know bad mothers . i came out of one .
ladies , what &apos;s happening over there ?
you know a gathering of more than two white people
makes me nervous .
earl , one of them &apos;s asian .
ah , same thing .
who would i talk to about the diner ?
we &apos;re interested in renting this location
to film a tv show .
we think your diner would be a great place to kill someone .
i get it .
&apos;cause every time i come in here , i die a little .
here &apos;s my card .
tom woo , law &amp; order : special victims unit .
shut your face , tom woo !
i love all the law &amp; orders , especially svu .
their stories are ripped from the headlines ,
and i don &apos;t read the newspaper ,
so that &apos;s where i get all my news .
cool . let me go get the director .
that &apos;s him over there .
look how cute the director is .
he &apos;s my rugged guy type .
not really rugged at all ,
but buys expensive , ruggedlooking clothing
from saks 5th avenue .
hi . dj kingsley .
nice beard .
you grow out that stubble
or just set your razor to &quot; jason statham . &quot;
excuse me , sir .
you &apos;ve got a great face .
have you ever done any extra work ?
well , i was in the 1973 classic
scream , blacula , scream .
pam grier kicked me in the nuts
and called me a &quot; jive turkey . &quot;
if you &apos;d consider it ,
i &apos;d love to have your look in the episode .
hey , what about me ?
you can shave my head , drag me behind a car ,
or anything else i &apos;ve already done for free .
sure . and you must be an actress .
you &apos;re way too pretty to just be a waitress .
thank you !
in fact i have done a little acting .
in high school , i portrayed fantine in les miserables .
just hearing you say that makes me &quot; miserobble . &quot;
well , how about it ?
you wanna hang with me
and be an extra on special victims unit ?
it pays 112 a day
plus whatever you normally make in tips .
oh , so about 115 ? i &apos;m in .
mama needs a new pair of horseshoes .
so where &apos;s the boss ?
i &apos;m the boss , but i &apos;ll get the guy who owns the place .
oleg !
they &apos;re shooting a tv show here ,
and the back of my head or the side of my boob
is gonna be in it !
good for you , max .
i was on ukraine &apos;s version of big brother once ,
进行社交生存游戏的节目
better known as just living in ukraine .
han ! law and order : special victims unit
wants to shoot in the diner , and if you don &apos;t say yes ,
you &apos;ll be my special victim when i cut your unit off .
please say yes , han .
they &apos;re gonna pay us to be in the background .
but do you know how to act ?
actually we do .
my acting &apos;s method , whereas hers is more meth head .
hey , come in .
and remember ,
if he says no , he doesn &apos;t mean it .
he just wants you to flirt with him a little bit .
not so fast , max .
hello , i &apos;m han lee , the owner and proprietor .
oh , &quot; proprietor . &quot;
that &apos;s word &apos;s bigger than you are .
what kinda compensation do you want ?
whoa , whoa , my asian brother .
slow down ! let &apos;s enjoy the dance .
we &apos;d like to shoot here .
it &apos;s got the right amount of funk and skank .
if we do real good in this and get a spinoff ,
that &apos;ll be the name of our show
funk and skank .
okay , but i don &apos;t wanna be skank .
oh , clearly i &apos;m skank .
and may i say i &apos;m honored
i have such a worthy opponent to barter with .
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
dude , i &apos;m from pasadena .
i can &apos;t believe this !
i never thought i &apos;d be in a tv show
where no one was yelling ,
&quot; you are not the father ! &quot;
与生父失联的母亲上节目找出孩子亲爹验dna
let &apos;s go . bring in the waitress extras .
ooh , i love these uniforms !
i feel like brenda from 90210
when she was dressed as that &apos; 50s waitress at the peach pit .
well , when we &apos;re the big stars of funk and skank ,
we won &apos;t have to wear any uniforms .
but wait , aren &apos;t funk and skank cops ?
uh , no , they &apos;re hookers .
how about a compromise ?
cops by day , prostitutes by night ?
you know , copstitutes .
either way , we &apos;re new york &apos;s finest .
okay , everybody , ready ! here we go .
look at earl over there .
good luck , earl !
camera on the door . scene eight , take one .
and action ! shooter comes in .
and cut ! good ! reset .
earl , that was inspiring .
i hope everyone who sees you goes out and ignores a crime .
it was like that scene was about the cash register guy .
you really brought something extra .
i smell an emmy .
oh , that &apos;s weed .
hi . sorry we haven &apos;t gotten to you guys yet .
why don &apos;t you hang out in the office ?
i hear there &apos;s good sushi .
you look pretty .
i think the director kinda likes me .
well , i don &apos;t know about him , but his penis does .
okay , camera on the door .
scene eight , take two .
and action ! shooter comes in .
bang ! bang !
cut !
excuse me , how did you get through ?
oh , please .
i once got through the berlin wall .
you think two kids with walkietalkies can stop me ?
damn , this room &apos;s got a sweet spread .
free sushi ? uh , yes .
free dessert ? uh duh .
this is great .
we &apos;ve gotta figure out a way to get paid
to sit around , eat free food , and do nothing more often .
oh , i think you cracked that code a long time ago .
would it be tacky
if i packed some sushi in my purse for later ?
already packed mine , already packed yours .
this is the vip lounge .
see ? the shrimp have already been deturded .
oh , hi , girls .
you finally got new uniforms . you look stupid .
these are actually from the costume department
of a little show called law &amp; order : svu
that max and i are costarring in .
costars ? honey , please .
you two are just extras .
um , extra paid and full of purse sushi .
they &apos;re ready for you two .
oh ! be right there .
just gonna put my purse in the fridge .
thomas . tom . tpain . can we chat ?
what is it , dude ?
your crew got soy sauce all over my computer .
and according to our agreement , you must pay all the damages .
how much do you want ?
$ 300 .
it &apos;s a piece of crap .
but it was a gift from my father .
and you know how important family is in our culture .
again , i don &apos;t . i was raised by two white women .
yes , uh , who do i talk to about becoming a star ?
this is so exciting !
god ! that woman keeps pushing my head down .
i feel like i &apos;m on a date with her .
okay , so you guys are here behind the counter ,
doing your waitress thing .
shooter aims for the cook
but hits her , our featured waitress .
hey , didn &apos;t i already see you on svu ?
oh , yeah , i remember .
they found your head in a mini fridge in the hudson .
i knew i recognized you .
wait , we &apos;ve already killed you ?
sorry , babe , you &apos;re out .
well , you gave great head .
tom , we gotta bump someone up to the featured waitress .
pays 1,000 more bucks .
max , that could be the extra money
we need for chestnut .
could one of us do it ?
can either of you act like you &apos;ve been hit with a bullet ?
well , it just so happens
i have been hit by a bullet twice
once at a 7 @-@ eleven and once running away
in the parking lot of a 7 @-@ eleven .
so yeah , i think i got this .
i &apos;m thinking maybe a blonde would be better .
caroline ?
well , i did have a pretty convincing death scene
as fantine , and i died like ...
well , should i just show you ?
you are such a nerd .
that &apos;s great , caroline .
special effects ,
put the blood device on caroline .
she &apos;s our special victim .
really ? i got it ?
yes , but a little less &quot; french revolution , &quot;
and a lot more &quot; face down on the floor . &quot;
you can &apos;t take a shot . you can &apos;t even do a shot .
don &apos;t be mad , max . i &apos;m doing this for chestnut .
and it &apos;s not my fault he liked my death scene .
he liked your death scene with his penis .
wow , max , show business really brings out the worst in you .
you haven &apos;t seen me at a wedding .
hello ! you just put your hand
down a woman &apos;s blouse without asking ?
every day .
well , here . can i help you ?
no , it &apos;s a union thing .
aren &apos;t you in there a little long ?
yeah . let me just ...
caroline , that special effects rig you &apos;re wearing
is very sensitive ,
so don &apos;t let anything near your chest .
except me .
and don &apos;t be nervous .
the camera &apos;s gonna love you . how could it not ?
dj , stop flirting with me .
i &apos;m gonna die soon and you &apos;ll never get over me .
promise you &apos;ll die soon ?
max , i &apos;m about to be shot ,
and i can &apos;t die with bad blood between us .
we &apos;re good . you &apos;re living my dream , girl .
do me proud .
i will .
no ! don &apos;t hug with it !
caroline , you set the thing off .
we weren &apos;t rolling .
really ?
that &apos;s too bad , because that was gold .
that &apos;s a wrap , everybody . we &apos;ll pick it up tomorrow .
i &apos;m so sorry . it just went off .
prettiest screwup all day .
after you get cleaned up ,
why don &apos;t we have dinner at my hotel ?
dinner ? yeah , i &apos;d like that .
let &apos;s say 8 : 00 .
my assistant will give you the address and my room number .
you know , this is exactly how you look in all my dreams
where i shoot you .
the director just invited me to dinner at his hotel ,
but it &apos;s in his room .
do you think he ...
yes .
is that why he ...
yes .
will you come with ?
yes .
maybe you &apos;re wrong .
maybe he thought my audition was really ...
no .
caroline , next time , maybe a little less .
now , remember .
this director slips you anything that looks like a sweet tart ,
it &apos;s probably that date rape drug that knocks you out
and distorts your memory .
or at least that &apos;s what it does to the guys i give it to .
it &apos;s never gonna get to that .
i have my own date rape drug .
i talk about myself incessantly
till guys get bored and pass out .
so if that doesn &apos;t work , what are your limits ?
a little over the sweater , under sweater ,
a little front door , back door ,
a little secret staircase ?
i don &apos;t know what that is ,
but no one goes up my staircase ,
not even for chestnut .
at the most , i &apos;ll do kissing .
you are thinking like an extra .
you need to think like a star
if you &apos;re gonna buy chestnut shoes ,
then therapy , then a way out of scientology .
oh , hi . you brought company .
yes , she &apos;s my ride .
we share a subway card .
well , she uses the card .
i jump the turnstile and she pretends to chase me ,
yelling &quot; don &apos;t worry , i &apos;ll get her ! &quot;
well , come on in .
stay for a glass of champagne , max .
oh , and don &apos;t worry about taking the subway home alone .
my driver can take you .
now i &apos;m torn .
because as much as i don &apos;t want you
to have sex against your will ,
i do wanna roll up to the mcdonald &apos;s in a limo .
there &apos;s no rush .
come on , let &apos;s sit down and hang out .
it was really nice of you to invite me up here
to have a casual , workrelated dinner .
max there , caroline there ,
and me , well , here .
can &apos;t turn it off , still directing .
you know , i love this hotel .
i came here once to do a photo shoot
for a &quot; 20 under 20 :
teen millionaires to watch &quot; spread ,
and i remember i had just gotten my haircut ,
which was a big decision ,
&apos;cause i was kinda known for my long hair .
and he wanted to take an inch off ,
which doesn &apos;t sound like a big deal ,
but when you &apos;re known for your long hair ...
people are expecting to see you with long hair .
so was that okay ?
yeah , sure .
it @-@ it &apos;s just max is here ,
and i don &apos;t want her to feel left out .
sorry . got it .
that was nice .
you &apos;re a good kisser .
are you eating a cinnamon altoid ?
i &apos;m eating a cinnamon altoid .
well , then i just tasted you .
look , dj , i think you have the wrong idea .
hold that thought .
i would never interrupt this for a work call ,
but it &apos;s my wife and i wanna say &quot; good night &quot; to the kids .
that guy &apos;s a player .
i &apos;m not talking my way out of this one .
we &apos;re screwed .
yeah .
he &apos;s got a high tolerance .
your longhair speech almost roofied me .
what do we do , max ? i don &apos;t want to offend him .
we need that extra money for chestnut .
this is the oldest tale in the book
a woman forced to trade her body to get her child shoes .
it &apos;s shakespearian , it &apos;s dickensian ,
it &apos;s kardashian .
look at the bright side .
you already thought he was sexy ,
so you were probably gonna sleep with him eventually .
and now that he &apos;s married ,
you know he won &apos;t cheat on you with somebody else
because you &apos;re that somebody else .
you a side bitch !
no , max , i can just tell him how i feel .
besides , he probably already got it .
you heard me tell him he read the signs wrong .
apparently the sign he read said &quot; threeway up ahead . &quot;
pretty good , right ?
hit show , wife , kids .
still find time to get to the gym .
so you guys need to drink a little more before we do this ?
&apos;cause i don &apos;t .
all right , i &apos;m just gonna say this
before that towel comes off .
i think you &apos;ve misread the signals here .
really ! that sucks .
i &apos;m sorry . these things happen .
it reminds me of that time i had tea
with that prince in dubai and he thought he bought me .
turns out he bought a different blonde .
oh , men !
good morning , dj .
morning !
see , max ? no hard feelings .
i told you it was gonna work out .
hi ! i &apos;m ready for my fake blood pouch .
um , i think you got the wrong breasts .
but for a rough guy , you got a soft touch .
there &apos;s been a change .
uh , max is now getting featured , and you &apos;re in the b.g.
background .
these are real ?
yep .
nice job .
you hear that , max ? now i &apos;m in the b.g.
i didn &apos;t do dj , so i &apos;m in the b.g.
max !
we have time for one full take before lunch ,
then we &apos;ll come back and do the rest of your coverage after .
hey , maybe you and i could have a little lunch together
in my trailer .
well , i do love a trailer .
okay , let &apos;s stay on schedule , people .
my kid &apos;s reading a poem at school .
by the way , your rack looks fantastic .
you seem like a great dad .
dj , is this about last night ,
&apos;cause i wouldn &apos;t wear a towel ?
no . no , we &apos;re good .
i don &apos;t wanna see that . bury her deep .
&quot; bury her deep &quot; ?
did he just say , &quot; bury her deep &quot; ?
caroline , you need to work back there .
is this how hollywood treats women ?
this is how hollywood treats everyone .
everybody ready .
max , if you do this , you &apos;ll be getting paid for sex .
well , it &apos;s about time .
places , everyone .
you don &apos;t have to do this . chestnut is my horse .
and action ! max , you &apos;re wiping the counter .
the killer comes in . you look up .
don &apos;t do it .
we can find money somewhere else .
cut ! tom , i don &apos;t wanna see her .
caroline .
here they come .
come on , everybody . back to one .
and action ! max , you &apos;re wiping the counter .
the killer comes in . you look up .
pick up !
max , seriously , it &apos;s not worth it .
cut ! get her out of there .
reset , reset .
sorry about all that , people .
now , let &apos;s give me the bullet
i &apos;ve been waiting for my whole life .
i haven &apos;t felt this unwanted since i tried to
teach those innercity school kids how to knit .
seriously , caroline , you have to stay here ,
away from the shot ,
or neither of you is gonna be paid .
hey , tom , you know what this scene needs ?
a little more cashier .
oy , that crew is doing a lot of damage to this diner .
well , i &apos;m doing some damage to this fancy french water .
150 for the floor , 20 for the napkins they used ,
and ...
and 55 bucks for that gorgeous picture of the city .
this is ridiculous .
how much longer do i have to wait to be discovered ?
do what every other american would do
skip the hard work and put out a sex tape .
no , i &apos;m gonna go out there . where &apos;s my lipstick ?
here , hold my shake weight .
and my fresca .
oh , hi .
who do i talk to about getting a part in this thing ?
i mean , i already let the guy
who puts out the cookies touch my boobs .
we don &apos;t have a guy who puts out cookies .
yo .
okay , everybody ready ! camera up !
oh , he looks important .
oh , no , no !
stop , stop !
no ! let go !
not the blood switch !
someone shot max !
cut ! tom , get rid of max too .
get me another girl .
typical !
shoot on my chest and you &apos;re done with me .
hi , you looking for a new girl ?
last time i looked like this ,
i was coming out of an acid trip
and my friend daniel was missing .
i gotta admit ,
getting shot felt kinda gangsta waitress .
i &apos;m like notorious blt .
so here &apos;s the deal .
we &apos;ll pay you for the day yesterday ,
but not for today or for the featured extra .
say what ?
not so fast , my brother .
here is the latest tally for my diner damage .
what &apos;s this last $ 1,000 charge ?
that is for the damage done to max and caroline .
according to crew scuttlebutt ,
the director tried some funny business last night .
this is not cool , dude .
it is most decidedly not cool , pal .
so maybe there is someone in a union i can talk to
about this particular damage .
not to mention the child labor laws you violated
by working with han .
don &apos;t talk to anyone . i &apos;ll get &apos; em paid .
this sucks .
i knew we should &apos;ve shot at a denny &apos;s .
han , that is the sweetest , coolest thing
you just did for us .
it is ,
and caroline is totally gonna put out for you tonight .
that &apos;s kind of her thing now .
well , i don &apos;t want anyone to take advantage of you two .
you &apos;re my girls .
and tonight , on a very special episode of funk and skank ,
the cute , tiny asian guy turns out to be the girls &apos; pimp ,
and the copstitutes are able to buy new horseshoes .
