别扭大菜
i &apos;m glad to see you made it safely
how &apos;s your hotel ?
it &apos;s not the best best western i &apos;ve been to ,
but i &apos;d say it &apos;s ...
the third best best western i &apos;ve been to .
i know how you feel .
the best buy by my house is only the third best best buy .
they have the best buys ,
but having the best buys isn &apos;t the only thing
that makes a best buy the best best buy .
what makes a best best buy the best best buy ?
mm , that &apos;s a great question .
i like when they &apos;re next to a chipotle .
okay , well , i should unpack .
all right .
enjoy the neurobiology conference .
i will .
i ... wish you were here .
at a neurobiology conference ?
what a mean thing to say .
okay , i &apos;m glad you &apos;re not here ?
aw , you always know just what to say
after i tell you what to say .
good @-@ bye , sheldon .
bye .
oh ! good news , gentlemen .
amy &apos;s at a conference this weekend ,
which means i &apos;m available to be entertained , hmm .
as today &apos;s youth might put it :
who wants to get their sheld @-@ on ?
bernie and i are getting the house ready for the remodel .
we could always use an extra pair of hands .
that sounds awful . raj ?
uh , i &apos;ve got time booked in the telescope room all weekend
scanning for rogue planets .
you &apos;re more than welcome to join me .
that &apos;s the one to beat . leonard ?
oh , if anything , i &apos;m trying to get my sheld @-@ off .
well , then it looks like we have a winner . congratulations .
well , i should warn you , it &apos;s just looking at data
for hours and hours on a computer screen .
uh , stop selling it , kid . you won .
how was your day ?
oh , not good .
still couldn &apos;t get in to see dr. gallo .
a doctor ?
well , i hope you &apos;re not contagious .
i &apos;ve got a weekend in the telescope room
i &apos;ve been excited about for almost three minutes .
i &apos;m not sick . it &apos;s for work .
there &apos;s this doctor who refuses to see any sales reps .
i &apos;ve been trying to get in for months .
well , did you try wearing the shirt
i said was inappropriate for work ?
well , the doctor &apos;s a woman , but ...
yes , because you never know .
what kind of doctor is she ?
um , a psychiatrist . why ?
well , what if you make an appointment as a patient ?
then you &apos;ll get to talk to her .
yeah , they already know i &apos;m a pharmaceutical sales rep .
oh . what if leonard made an appointment
and tried to lay some groundwork for you ?
that &apos;s interesting .
i &apos;m not gonna make a fake appointment with a psychiatrist .
what would i say is wrong with me ?
low self @-@ esteem .
social anxiety .
sexual insecurity .
none of that is true .
uh , denial . see , sweetie , the list goes on and on .
that &apos;s just crazy .
how would my going in there even help you ?
i don &apos;t know . you could talk to her , and maybe if it comes up ,
you could ask if she &apos;s heard about the drug .
what if i get caught ?
fear of failure !
lack of confidence !
kind of a wuss !
fine , i &apos;ll do it .
but not because of them , because i love you .
thank you .
pushover .
spineless .
still hasn &apos;t bought milk even though i told him two days ago !
that was incredible .
it was .
i just wish stuart wasn &apos;t around
so we didn &apos;t have to be so quiet .
i know .
it &apos;s not like he returns the favor
when he watches his japanese porn cartoons .
you guys got a minute ,
or are you still cuddling ?
what is it , stuart ?
can i come in ?
hang on .
should i send him away ?
no , it &apos;s okay .
thanks , bernie .
what &apos;s up ?
uh , well , i know the remodel is coming up ,
so i thought i &apos;d make it easy on you guys
and find my own place .
i thought i was done getting lucky tonight .
so , when are you thinking of moving ?
uh , actually , i already found an apartment ,
so in a couple of days .
oh . okay .
sorry to see you go ?
okay , well , thank you guys for everything .
i @-@ i really appreciate it .
you &apos;re very welcome .
what ?
hmm , i just have never been in this room while you &apos;re awake .
what are you doing ?
uh , making sure the telescope &apos;s camera is white @-@ field balanced .
what are you doing now ?
still making sure the telescope &apos;s camera
is white @-@ field balanced .
oh , i see .
how about now ?
now i &apos;m making sure the telescope &apos;s camera is white @-@ field balanced
and wishing you had a coloring book .
well , i can be helpful .
give me something to do .
you know , my father took me to work once ,
and in ten minutes i figured out
who &apos;d been stealing from the cash register .
it was my father .
yeah , dad lost his job ,
but mr. hinckley gave me a fudgsicle .
fine , you want something to do ?
there &apos;s about six months of data on this hard drive .
why don &apos;t you go through it and see if you can spot
any patterns or anomalies .
yep , i &apos;m on it .
hey , look at that !
an indian guy outsourcing a computer job to a white fella .
yeah , okay , whatever it takes
to keep you busy for a few hours .
found one .
no , you didn &apos;t .
there are millions of data points there .
but , look , an optical transient .
yeah , maybe that is something .
how did you find that ?
it wasn &apos;t difficult .
you know how when you see prime numbers , they appear red ,
but when they &apos;re twin primes ,
they &apos;re pink and smell like gasoline ?
no .
i guess i &apos;m a special boy .
you know , sometimes when a boy is special ,
he gets a fudgsicle .
which , by the way , tastes like the speed of light .
thank you for seeing me on such short notice .
ah , it &apos;s my pleasure .
i &apos;m curious ,
are you related to dr. beverly hofstadter ?
uh , she &apos;s my mother . you know her ?
no , not personally ,
but i have read all of her books .
well , then you know her better than i do .
well , i &apos;m not so sure about that .
but i can tell you i do not agree
with her theories on child rearing at all .
really ?
any chance you find them cold , cruel and unsuitable
for innocent little boys who just want to be happy ?
well , i didn &apos;t want to say it ...
no , no , say it . sing it .
rent a plane , write it in the sky .
sounds like you &apos;re holding on
to quite a bit of anger towards her .
oh , no , i @-@ i &apos;ve worked through a lot of that stuff ;
i &apos;m better now .
good for you .
do you know she never let me celebrate my birthday
because being born was her achievement , not mine ?
that &apos;s heartbreaking .
right ?
to this day , i send her a card every year
with a little money in it .
you know , once we get the house back to ourselves ,
we can be romantic in any room we want .
great . i can finally show you where the laundry room is .
boy , who would &apos;ve thought
when you asked me to move in and help take care of your mom ,
i &apos;d still be here two years later ?
nobody thought that .
no one .
well , that &apos;s it .
i guess so .
this is weird .
yeah . a grown man moving into his own apartment .
crazy times . see ya !
ignore him .
he &apos;s just using humor to express how ...
happy he is .
it &apos;s okay . i know he loves me .
sure he does .
well , let us know when you &apos;re all settled in .
i will .
and i really can &apos;t thank you guys enough .
our pleasure .
bye .
bye .
he &apos;s gone !
let &apos;s start in the garage !
okay , so once we receive the next image
and compare it to the ones we &apos;ve already collected ,
we &apos;ll know what it is that we found .
ooh , perhaps it &apos;s a heliosheath scintillation .
it could be a trans @-@ neptunian object .
maybe it &apos;s a new planet .
unlikely , but it could be a dwarf planet .
well , as long as it has a healthy gravity
and all its moons , i &apos;ll be happy .
okay , the final image is coming in .
and the object we discovered is ...
come on ,
daddy needs a livable planet he can rule with an iron fist .
a medium @-@ sized asteroid .
that &apos;s it ?
how common .
that &apos;s the chicken fingers on the menu of space .
i kind of like chicken fingers .
yeah , me , too . i was stuck for a metaphor .
come on , a medium @-@ sized asteroid
is still an interesting discovery .
i suppose it could end up on a collision course with earth
and destroy life as we know it .
you dream different than me .
it is kind of cute .
yeah , it is . and you know we get to name it .
we better choose a name no one can make fun of .
sir frederick william herschel didn &apos;t do uranus any favors .
hey , how &apos;d it go ?
oh , great .
dr. gallo is terrific .
you know , i @-@ i &apos;ve always been insecure
that no one cares about what i have to say ,
but she made me see ...
yeah , no one cares .
did you help me out or not ?
okay , n @-@ now , what i &apos;m hearing
is that you feel that i sometimes take too long
to express myself ,
and you wish i &apos;d be more succinct .
you &apos;re only hearing that because
i cannot roll my eyes any louder .
all right , well , after we talked about my issues with my mother--
nothing too deep , just how she ruined my life--
i told her about you and your drug ;
she said she &apos;d be happy to meet you .
really ?
oh , you &apos;re the best husband ever !
so you &apos;ll go to the doctor who convention with me next week ?
i guess .
oh , i actually did hear your eyes roll that time .
boy , when was the last time stuart cleaned this place ?
no kidding .
oh , okay , i &apos;m about to suck something up .
what do you think this object sounds like ?
howie , i don &apos;t want to play lego , toenail or pill anymore .
so , what do you think we should do with this room ?
well , i was thinking a home theater or a gaming room--
you know , like a man cave .
why can &apos;t it be a woman cave ?
as long as it has a home theater , a video game system
and you &apos;re not allowed in it ,
you can call it whatever you want .
i &apos;m being serious .
well , what do you think we should do ?
i don &apos;t know ,
maybe a home office or ...
look .
the teddy bear stuart won the night we took him to the fair .
he was so excited .
yeah .
you know , no matter how hard they tried ,
they could not guess his age .
i &apos;ll give it to him next time i see him .
have you heard from him since he left ?
no .
you &apos;d think he would &apos;ve called once he got settled in .
hmm . maybe he &apos;s busy .
too busy to call ?
he wasn &apos;t too busy
to binge @-@ watch hot in cleveland with my hulu password .
what is happening ?
are we missing him ?
no , that &apos;s not what this feeling is .
is it ?
of course not . he drove us crazy .
like when you were gonna make that pie
and stuart ate all the blueberries .
and he tried to deny it , but his teeth were all purple .
that was pretty cute .
yeah .
ew , we are missing him !
so i was thinking , maybe we can come up with a name
for the asteroid by combining our names .
that &apos;s a great idea .
i &apos;ve got it .
we &apos;ll call it ... cooper .
how is that both our names ?
&quot; koo &quot; from koothrappali and &quot; per &quot; from cooper .
yeah , s @-@ so it &apos;s , like , kooper with a &quot; k &quot; ?
nah , you &apos;re right , that &apos;s dumb .
oh , leonard , great news .
we discovered a medium @-@ sized asteroid together .
wow , that &apos;s amazing !
i &apos;m in a pretty great mood today myself .
okay . guess we &apos;re gonna talk about you now .
well , we are , because dr. gallo made me realize
that i &apos;m a worthwhile person and that my feelings matter .
i learned that for free from a cat poster ,
but good for you .
okay , back to me .
i discovered an asteroid ,
and now i get to name it .
wait , what happened to us ?
now , this isn &apos;t about us ,
this is about what &apos;s best for the asteroid .
what are you thinking of naming it ?
i haven &apos;t settled on anything yet .
we haven &apos;t settled on anything yet .
all right , way to go , cat poster . you hang in there .
you know what &apos;d be nice ? name it after your girlfriends .
show them how much you care .
that is a great idea .
it &apos;s perfect .
it appears romantic ,
but it &apos;s really just a rock in space
that gets me out of valentine &apos;s day forever .
so , uh , what were you thinking ? combine their names ?
i like it .
yeah , we &apos;ll take the &quot; a @-@ m &quot; from amy and , uh ,
the &quot; y &quot; from emily .
that &apos;s just amy .
exactly . see how well we work together ?
and in double @-@ blind studies ,
placinex proved extremely effective in treating
all kinds of anxiety .
actually , funny story-- the boys in the lab
were worried about getting fda approval for placinex ;
they started taking it , stopped worrying .
got it .
uh , do you have any questions ?
just one .
when you made your husband pretend to be a patient
so you could get access to me ,
what were you thinking there ?
i just ... meant a question about the drug .
yeah , i know what you meant .
let &apos;s put that aside for a minute
and talk about why you married leonard .
i don &apos;t wanna .
here is a man raised by an overbearing woman
who completely dominated
every aspect of his formative years .
do you think
he &apos;s perpetuating that relationship
by seeking out a partner like you ?
you know , i used to wear tank tops a lot .
that was a big selling point .
hi , sheldon . what &apos;s up ?
good news . you &apos;re an asteroid .
uh ... please tell me what to say next .
perhaps i should explain .
while working with koothrappali ,
we discovered an asteroid ,
and i named it after you .
sheldon , thank you .
that &apos;s so romantic .
but what about rajesh ?
he was okay with you choosing the name ?
well , it took a little negotiating ,
but i wore him down .
uh , we get the asteroid ,
and if you and i have children ,
they all have to be named rajesh .
all of them ?
even the girls .
okay , i think i know what to say now .
how can i not sound like his mother
when our entire bedroom is filled with star wars toys ?
i mean , have you ever had sex
with a stuffed wookiee watching you ?
i went to college in the &apos; 70s ;
it was a hairier time .
i &apos;m gonna say yes .
you know , if anything , he &apos;s turning me into his mother .
before i did pharmaceutical sales , i was an actress .
you know , i was pretty good .
you know , girl @-@ next @-@ door type , but hot .
doable .
and not only am i leonard &apos;s mother ,
but we have this man @-@ child living with us named sheldon .
oh , leonard talked a lot about him .
i wasn &apos;t sure if he was real .
yeah , he &apos;s as real as the fine i get
when i use too much toilet paper .
wow , you really do have a lot on your plate .
i do .
you know , leonard &apos;s right .
talking to you is really helping .
oh , i &apos;m glad .
you know , you might also benefit
from a prescription for anxiety .
okay , if you think it &apos;ll help .
oh , just don &apos;t make it placinex .
i do not need sudden fits of homicidal rage .
i miss you .
i miss you as well .
i can &apos;t believe i miss stuart .
i guess i just miss when life was simpler .
go , leonard ! go , leonard !
go , leonard ! go , leonard !
remember , girls , you decide what makes you happy ,
not your emotionally withholding mothers .
go , leonard ! go , leonard !
go , leonard ! go , leonard ! go , leonard !
i really miss this .
