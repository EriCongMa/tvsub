gossip girl here ,
your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
what in the hell were you trying to do ?
get ben out of prison , mom .
what , by putting me in ? the information about ben
in the affidavit can never get out , ever .
if you ever use that information about lily ,
i &apos;ll have you killed .
i figured we could spend the rest of the day
doing ... whatever .
tonight he &apos;s thinking about a different girl ,
and meanwhile , i lost my job , i failed a test ,
and i &apos;m in brooklyn talking about it to dan humphrey .
i overheard this guy talking about you to an employee .
he said that you were responsible for a fire
in one of your own buildings .
i &apos;ve had that man &apos;s death on my conscience for 20 years .
someone died ?
you &apos;re just upset because you lost your daddy &apos;s company .
brad , i &apos;m sorry he dragged you into this .
let me buy you a real dinner .
i think i &apos;ll stay and hear young mr. bass out .
we &apos;ll get through this .
you sound so sure , i almost believe you .
they &apos;re ready for us .
i &apos;ll be waiting . hmm ?
lily , this is assistant district attorney vinson .
he &apos;s going to be taking your statement .
whenever you &apos;re ready , mrs. humphrey .
they say rome wasn &apos;t built in a day ,
and yet what a difference a day makes .
hey . you coming down ?
mm , hot tea , dorota ,
decaf , and one of my leafy green juices .
thank you .
b. , you okay ? you seem different .
hmm ? i &apos;m doing a cleanse .
no , i mean ...
oh . i &apos;m fine .
being fired / quitting &quot; w &quot; was humiliating ,
but it was also a wake @-@ up call .
if chuck and i are meant to be together ,
then i should trust that , and in the meantime ,
i want whatever &apos;s best for both of us .
wow , that &apos;s very enlightened .
it &apos;s the leafy greens .
b vitamins are excellent for cognitive function .
good , because i need your help .
ben hasn &apos;t been returning any of my texts since we ...
spent the night together , and it was amazing ,
but it can &apos;t be a coincidence that he &apos;s suddenly avoiding me .
well , did you tell him you thought it was amazing ?
well , i think i made it pretty clear .
he is a guy .
you should march over there and make sure he knows .
and take a juice with you for the road .
thank you . b. , you really do seem good .
you &apos;re doing it again .
something is different about you .
i have a sixth sense .
you have no sense .
you don &apos;t come to me with any complaints about anything .
you &apos;re too happy ...
content . i &apos;m worried you join cult .
i have found my center , that &apos;s all .
but ... just to reassure you , here &apos;s a complaint .
why haven &apos;t you picked up my cocktail dress
for chuck &apos;s party yet ?
charles bass to see you ?
send him in .
let me guess .
you were in the neighborhood ,
and you thought you &apos;d stop by and gloat .
oh , no . i came to see raina . i guess she &apos;s not in yet .
i wanted to invite her to a party
i &apos;m having at the empire tonight .
my deal with kidd closes tomorrow .
you &apos;re welcome to attend as well .
sorry . i didn &apos;t come to gloat .
i &apos;ve just always been a multitasker .
don &apos;t you worry . a victory lap might be premature .
why would i ?
thanks for my invitation , chuck .
and as for my daughter &apos;s schedule ,
you might want to check with your buddy
nate archibald .
they &apos;ve been spending a lot of time together these last few days .
i see that &apos;s something else you aren &apos;t aware of .
meaning ?
your deal closes tomorrow ,
but you tell lily i &apos;ll see you both tonight .
so i thought maybe we &apos;d catch a matinee at the ziegfeld
before heading over to blondies to watch villanova
whup ass on notre dame .
sounds great , but ... have you told chuck about us yet ?
we &apos;re an &quot; us &quot; ?
i like you .
but i don &apos;t wanna come between you and your best friend ,
even if that best friend is chuck bass .
but ...
we haven &apos;t done anything yet , so you &apos;re free to pull the chute
and walk away if that &apos;s what you want .
that &apos;s not what i want ,
so i &apos;ll talk to chuck today .
in the spirit of full disclosure ,
there &apos;s something you need to know about me .
my dad and i ...
we &apos;re notre dame fans .
oh , no .
no , you can &apos;t be . what are you talking about ?
uh @-@ huh . guess ... kids are out of the question .
i can &apos;t believe i let you talk me
into the joseph beuys exhibit after all .
there was a great article in here on him . you should read it .
we should go over field trip procedures again .
oh , joy .
okay , i arrive first , survey the location
in case there &apos;s anyone i know and scout out an exit strategy .
you arrive at least 15 minutes later .
plausible deniability . we just ran into each other .
you &apos;re really big on plausible deniability .
has anybody ever told you that ?
do you wanna explain to someone why we went somewhere together ?
ms. blair ?
uh ... go through my bathroom into serena &apos;s room .
come on .
is this really necessary ?
move it !
dorota .
you scared me . what are you doing back so soon ?
oh , i forgot claim ticket . who were you talking to ?
no one . maybe your sixth sense is picking up voices
from the other side .
you know what ? i could use some fresh air .
i will go with you to get the dress .
let &apos;s go . now .
&quot; daniel humphrey . &quot;
daniel humphrey !
let &apos;s go ! chop @-@ chop !
hey . what are you doing here ?
i know i probably should have called first ,
but ... you haven &apos;t returned any of my earlier calls ,
so i figured i &apos;d just swallow my pride and stop by .
now would be a good time to give my pride a boost
and invite me in .
uh ... now actually isn &apos;t a good time .
ben ?
what &apos;s she doing here ?
uh ... serena , this is my mother , cynthia .
mrs. sharp , i , um ,
i &apos;m serena . it &apos;s a pleasure to meet you .
i wish i could say the same .
ben ?
remember i told you serena &apos;s friends with my roommate dan .
i &apos;m sorry . he &apos;s not here right now ,
but i &apos;ll--i &apos;ll let him know that you stopped by .
so you didn &apos;t tell her about us ?
no .
why not ?
sorry , s. looks like your sweetheart &apos;s mom
is still a little sour .
oh , thank you , vanya . i just need to make sure
that my elie saab dress is in there
for the party tonight .
here you are , ma &apos;am .
thank you .
but when it comes to life &apos;s bitter pills ...
is everything okay ?
yes , vanya , thank you .
the hardest to swallow is a taste of your own medicine .
i @-@ i &apos;m sorry .
i @-@ i should &apos;ve given you a heads up .
she got here a few days ago .
that &apos;s why i haven &apos;t been able to return your calls .
and here i thought i was being paranoid .
look , it &apos;s hard enough trying to explain to her
why i haven &apos;t tried to clear my name .
if i--if i tell her that we &apos;re dating ,
she &apos;s gonna think i &apos;m doing all this for you .
her issue is with my mother , not me .
you were able to win over my family and my friends .
i just want the same chance .
hey , how about we have lunch today ,
just the three of us at my place ?
i &apos;ll talk to her .
someone who knows about ben is trying to send a message .
subtle .
it &apos;s russell , i &apos;m assuming . we spoke this morning .
he told me our victory party was premature .
well , if he knows , he &apos;ll use it to kill the deal ,
threaten to go public unless--
he &apos;s fishing . if he had proof ,
he would &apos;ve made that play by now .
we need to shut down his lead , whoever it is .
what about ben ?
you don &apos;t think russell could have gotten to him ?
well , i don &apos;t think so .
we seem to have resolved our issues , and--
i &apos;d make sure if i were you . in the meantime ,
i &apos;ll try and find out what russell &apos;s planning .
charles , i &apos;m so sorry .
talk to ben .
so why did you wanna grab coffee with your old man ?
do i need a reason ?
no , but you have one .
i , uh , i need your advice ,
but i gotta keep the details vague .
oh , please , the vaguer , the better .
keeps parenting a challenge .
you ever hung out with someone but not been able
to tell anyone ?
you mean , hang out , hang out ,
or , you know , hang out , hang out ?
oh , god , this was a bad idea .
what ? that was vague . well , for what it &apos;s worth ,
when lily and i started hanging out again ,
neither of us wanted anyone else to know .
but friendship can be an excuse ,
a cover when there &apos;s something more you don &apos;t want to admit
or you &apos;re too scared to explore .
no , no , no . i mean , there &apos;s no way .
that ... i mean , even the thought of that is ...
scary .
no , i mean , we &apos;re not even friends , i swear .
we &apos;re not . listen , why don &apos;t we , uh ,
why don &apos;t we just turn this coffee into a lunch ?
oh , i thought you said you only had an hour
before you had to be somewhere .
i did , not now i don &apos;t .
would you pick up the pace ?
sorry , i don &apos;t want to make you late to ...
what exhibit is it again ?
joseph beuys . why ?
maybe i could go with you .
you don &apos;t even know who he is .
he created term &quot; social sculpture &quot;
to illustrate idea of art &apos;s potential to transform society .
how do you know that ?
from mr. humphrey &apos;s &quot; new york &quot; magazine
i found in your room .
just what are you implying ?
your new secrecy , calmness with mr. chuck ,
supporting ms. serena &apos;s new boyfriend ,
and last week ,
i find &quot; nova &quot; documentary in your netflix queue !
what are you doing in my queue ?
you and lonely boy are having affair !
we are not !
we have gone to a few things together .
it started over the holidays . it &apos;s no big deal .
no big deal ? we have to tell ms . serena .
we will do no such thing .
i am not friends with dan humphrey .
and to prove it , i will happily skip the beuys exhibit
and leave him hanging . i would rather shop anyhow .
so come on . let &apos;s go . first stop , chlo ?
well , thank you for the tour , serena .
good thing you &apos;re serving lunch .
i &apos;m hungry after all that walking .
mom .
i &apos;m just trying to joke . i &apos;m nervous .
i &apos;m not used to being in a place like this .
so i thought i would keep things simple for lunch .
most people &apos;s favorite pizza in manhattan is john &apos;s ,
but i &apos;ve always been partial to joe &apos;s .
i &apos;m , uh , lactose @-@ intolerant .
oh , my gosh . i &apos;m ... i &apos;m so sorry .
salad it is , then ?
here you go .
thanks .
i &apos;m sorry . this is , um ...
about school , and i forgot the iced tea ,
so i &apos;ll be right back .
hey , mom , can we talk later ?
this will only take a minute .
why are you whispering ?
ben and i are having lunch with his mother .
his mother ? serena , charles and i think
that russell thorpe knows about ben and is gonna use it
to sabotage charles &apos; deal .
i hate to ask this , but i need to make sure
that ben hasn &apos;t told anyone about the affidavit ,
that he hasn &apos;t had a change of heart .
no , no , no , of course he hasn &apos;t .
but i &apos;ll talk to him . i &apos;m sure everything &apos;s fine .
thank you .
oh , uh , someone &apos;s here . um , will you call me
after you speak to him ?
yeah , of course .
i know you don &apos;t wanna speak to me ,
but serena won &apos;t return my calls ,
and she told her doorman to tell me she wasn &apos;t home
even though i saw that she was on &quot; gossip girl . &quot;
can you blame her ?
it &apos;s about ben .
so ... if you haven &apos;t already guessed ,
serena and i are more than just friends .
you think i don &apos;t know ?
why do you think i came to new york ?
how &apos;d you figure it out ?
it doesn &apos;t matter . what matters is that you &apos;re giving up
any chance of getting your life back for her .
i knew you were gonna say that .
because it &apos;s the truth .
and you don &apos;t see it , but you &apos;re caught in a trap .
you wanna be the kind of man that serena van der woodsen
could be with . you could do that .
but not without clearing my name and getting my record expunged ,
which i can &apos;t do without destroying serena &apos;s family .
you can only lose here , ben .
mom ...
i think i left my purse upstairs .
please , uh , tell serena that i said good @-@ bye .
you were right .
this is a much better idea than spending the day
pretending to like some german pedagogue of art .
i &apos;m gonna shop until you drop .
that could happen at any time .
go to ralph lauren . have them pull everything in my size .
i &apos;ll meet you there .
but , please , my--i &apos;m beginning to lose feeling in my fingers .
well , then go to cafe boulud
and get us a table . we &apos;ll have lunch .
i thought you were on cleanse .
excuse me ?
why aren &apos;t you at mona meeting me ?
i decided to grab lunch with my dad instead .
why aren &apos;t you at mona meeting me ?
i &apos;m standing you up .
ah , well , apparently , great minds think alike .
but i had good reason .
and i would love to hear that reason ,
but my dad is gonna be out any second ,
and i haven &apos;t scouted an exit strategy for you , so ...
we are not done here .
yeah , we are .
why would a friendship based on fight
suddenly end in flight ?
they say we only run from the things that truly scare us .
hey , i was watching you this morning , man .
you looked good .
thanks .
i was , uh , just leaving . what &apos;s up ?
i &apos;m looking for raina .
i thought you might know her schedule .
or are you going to stand there and lie to my face ?
look , we &apos;re just hanging out . okay ? that &apos;s it .
i guess the archibald charm wasn &apos;t as rusty as you thought ,
unlike the knife in my back .
i talked you up to her like you asked me to .
she wanted nothing to do with you .
don &apos;t sugarcoat it .
i like raina , all right ? and she likes me .
i didn &apos;t mean for it to happen this way , but it did .
i &apos;m sorry . what else can i do ?
there is one thing .
did you come all the way to brooklyn
just to yell at me ? &apos; cause that &apos;s really not necessary .
yes , it is . dorota saw your &quot; new york &quot; magazine
and accused us of having an affair .
that &apos;s why i stood you up .
so you mean because we were sneaking around ,
she assumed we were covering something up ?
can you believe it ?
well , only because my dad basically told me
the same thing . look , if anyone else finds out about this--
they &apos;ll jump to the same conclusion .
god . i knew you &apos;d be my social death , humphrey .
i just knew it !
no , you know what ? it &apos;s gonna be fine .
we can make it fine . all we have to do is tell everyone
that we &apos;ve been hanging out . it &apos;s not gonna be a big deal
unless we keep making it a big deal .
right , which it totally isn &apos;t . you know , we should soften
the ground , put out an anonymous post on &quot; gossip girl &quot;
that some big secret is going to come out at chuck &apos;s party .
that way , everyone will assume that some earth @-@ shattering ,
huge scandal is eminent , like--
you getting traded for a hotel ?
or you raising georgina &apos;s baby by a russian mobster .
we &apos;ll have successfully managed expectations ,
and by the time our friendship is announced ,
it &apos;ll seem like nothing at all .
so we tell everyone tonight . agreed ?
agreed . oh , and ... only i get to joke about the hotel .
still too soon .
a few years ago , my stepmother perjured herself ,
and an innocent man went to prison .
why are you telling me this ?
because i believe your father already knows .
and i think he &apos;s planning
to use this information as leverage to blow my deal .
how many times do i have to tell you ?
he isn &apos;t like you .
maybe not yet , but if i &apos;m right ,
he &apos;s about to cross the line .
you can stop him , raina .
but if you care about him , you &apos;ll do this .
i would never confront him based on your word alone .
i &apos;m not asking you to .
hey , mom , thanks for coming . lunch did not end well .
serena , we need to talk .
what &apos;s she doing here ?
you need to listen to her .
no , i don &apos;t , and neither should you .
vanessa , tell her .
when nate &apos;s dad was in prison , was he attacked ?
yeah , and nate was pretty upset about it .
why ? what does this have to do with me ?
because the person who had him attacked was ben .
you &apos;re lying .
i heard it from ben himself .
i overheard him telling damien after eric &apos;s party .
just ... get out , please .
serena , you should be careful .
his sister made me think she was someone else , too .
darling , i think vanessa &apos;s telling the truth .
is it possible that you don &apos;t know ben
as well as you think you do ?
is it possible that he &apos;s talked to russell ?
why would ben care about russell thorpe ?
and if he wanted revenge ,
he would have gone to the police himself weeks ago .
besides , the affidavit proves what you did .
wait a minute . you didn &apos;t destroy it ?
no . i @-@ i thought i should hold on to it for safekeeping .
i mean , isn &apos;t that why you had it in the safety deposit box
in the first place ?
did ben know where you kept it ?
yeah , but you don &apos;t think ...
where is it now ?
oh , my god .
it &apos;s gone . he took it .
looks like the jury on ben might be out after all .
congratulations .
congratulations .
photo , chuck ?
champagne , sir ?
thank you . thank you all for coming .
as you know , my deal with bradley kidd
officially closes tomorrow .
as they always say , why put off till tomorrow
a party you could throw today ? cheers .
we &apos;re all set .
when i meet russell in my suite , raina will be in the kitchen .
as soon as she hears him blackmail me ,
she &apos;ll confront him .
do you think that &apos;ll be enough ?
the only thing that &apos;s more important to him than
ruining us is maintaining his relationship with his daughter .
have you spoken to ben ?
he hasn &apos;t returned any of my calls .
hopefully , he didn &apos;t hear the panic in my voice
and is still coming here .
i know i can talk him out of it .
he just got turned around by his mother .
well , i &apos;m sure that &apos;s so , but if he &apos;s already
given it to russell , then it &apos;s over .
i &apos;m so sorry , mom .
ohh . don &apos;t be . it &apos;s not your mistake .
it never was .
he &apos;s here .
hey . so ... did you see the post on &quot; gossip girl &quot;
about some huge secret coming out tonight ?
yeah , and i think i know what it &apos;s about .
you do ?
ben has the forged affidavit
that could put my mother in jail .
we think that he gave it to russell thorpe ,
who &apos;s gonna try to blackmail her and chuck with it .
oh , my gosh . s. , i &apos;m so sorry .
serena , hey .
wow . listen , i mean , it &apos;s really not that big of a deal--
impolite to interrupt , humphrey .
look , you go talk to ben , and i &apos;ll be here
whenever you need me .
thank you .
what &apos;s going on ? did you tell her ?
now &apos;s not a good time .
hey . are you okay ?
i know you took it .
what ?
don &apos;t . you knew where the affidavit was .
just please tell me you haven &apos;t given it to russell yet .
why would i do that ?
i heard your mother &apos;s speech today about how you couldn &apos;t
have a life until you turned my mother in
and turned your back on me .
i guess she convinced you .
after all this time , you still don &apos;t trust me ?
what do i need to do that i haven &apos;t done already ?
be honest with me .
i have .
okay . well , what about nate &apos;s dad ?
i had that done , yeah .
but do you know how many things
i haven &apos;t told you about my time in prison--
things that i @-@ i just wanna forget ?
look , i know what you were going through ,
but to have someone attacked--
do not tell me that you understand what i went through .
hi . lily ? we haven &apos;t officially met ,
but do you know who i am ?
let me hazard a guess and say that
i &apos;m surprised to see you here , mrs. sharp .
hey , russell , good to see you .
oh . my friend has arrived . good .
hello , russell .
how are you ?
good to see you . are you enjoying yourself ?
russell thorpe . how do you , uh ...
ben didn &apos;t steal the affidavit .
you did .
mr. thorpe contacted me and said that
if i could get ben to turn on you ,
then he could get ben his life back .
of course , he wouldn &apos;t listen , but it didn &apos;t matter ,
because he &apos;d already let it slip about the affidavit .
ben will never forgive you for what you &apos;ve done .
well , as parents ,
sometimes we have to make those tough choices .
after all , isn &apos;t that what you told yourself ?
hey , dad , i &apos;m glad you &apos;re here . there &apos;s actually something
i need to ... talk to you or tell you about .
well , am i getting some details this time ?
on a need @-@ to @-@ know basis , but yes .
good , because i saw you talking to blair earlier ,
and i just about had a heart attack .
what do you mean ?
well , just how crazy it would be if your secret relationship
was with someone like blair waldorf .
no , i know . i know . that would-- that would be crazy .
um , rufus , can i talk to you alone ?
daniel , would you mind ?
it &apos;s fine . it &apos;s , uh , it &apos;s nothing that can &apos;t wait .
lily ? what is it ?
nate . hey .
what are you doing here ?
i was heading to the bar to meet you .
what are you doing here ? you &apos;re looking for chuck .
i am , actually , but ...
you don &apos;t understand , and you can &apos;t be here .
chuck is on his way up with my father .
come on .
is this quiet enough for you ?
i should talk to him alone .
no , this is my mess . trust me , you &apos;re going to need me .
well , you called this meeting .
you didn &apos;t wanna wear that gift i sent you this morning ?
orange is so your color .
i have guests downstairs .
and i have the nail for your coffin .
it &apos;s just a copy , of course .
perjury , obstruction of justice ,
bribery of public officials .
why don &apos;t we cut right to it ?
that i can do .
you sign over bass industries once and for all ,
or i &apos;ll destroy you and your entire family .
i &apos;m surprised you even have to think it over .
i wasn &apos;t thinking . i was waiting .
for what ?
for me .
he was right about you ,
this whole time .
he was right .
i &apos;d follow her if i were you .
no . he signs over the company right now ,
or you &apos;re going to jail .
maybe , but not because of you or anyone else .
i called the d.a. ten minutes ago .
rufus is waiting in the car to take me downtown .
lily , you can &apos;t .
once i go onord with the truth
no one can hold this against us anymore .
just promise me one thing .
before thorpe leaves here tonight ,
tell that son of a bitch where he can stick it .
thank you for saving his legacy .
bass industries isn &apos;t his legacy , charles .
you are .
oh . you heard the lady .
if that &apos;s all , i have guests downstairs .
they can wait . don &apos;t you even wanna know why--
why i was willing to sacrifice my own daughter
just to destroy your precious little legacy ?
because lily left you for my father .
i think you know me better than that by now .
did raina ever talk about her mother ?
careful , chuck . when it comes to bart bass ,
seek , and who knows what you may find ?
raina , wait up . hey , wait . talk to me .
i can &apos;t . you don &apos;t understand .
trust me . i do . and finding out your father isn &apos;t the person
you grew up idolizing sucks ,
but it doesn &apos;t mean he loves you any less .
then what does it mean ?
it means that he &apos;s human .
okay , and you have a chance , if you want ,
to get to know the real him-- the good and the bad .
what if i don &apos;t want to ?
you do .
when i was a little girl , he was larger than life ...
like superman .
yeah , but doesn &apos;t it make you feel a little better
to know that he wasn &apos;t ?
you &apos;re smarter than you look , archibald .
i get that a lot .
thank you .
yeah .
you wanna go catch the game highlights somewhere ?
i just need to not talk about this for a while .
yeah . that &apos;d be great .
my mom just left . she &apos;s turning herself in .
d.a. already called me to come down .
she told me it was your mother that took the affidavit .
never should &apos;ve mentioned it .
i just ... didn &apos;t think she would do something like that .
but ... i &apos;m to blame for what happened either way .
pretty sure damien &apos;s the one that went to thorpe .
why would he do that ?
i thought you told him last week you wouldn &apos;t cooperate .
that &apos;s not exactly what i told him .
i got pretty physical with him a while back ,
and ... i told him what i had done to the captain .
you ever have a dream that ... feels so real ,
when you wake up ,
you just wanna lie there with your eyes closed
to hold on to it ?
i barely remember being a teacher at knightley .
being with you makes it feel real
because you remember .
i do .
but maybe it &apos;s time for me to open my eyes
and let it go .
you mean let me go .
i obviously have a lot to figure out .
well , that guy that i fell for at knightley--
you &apos;re still him .
and i can see that even if you can &apos;t .
i don &apos;t know . maybe one day , when you do ...
you &apos;re lying .
believe me , i wish i were .
because of your father , my wife is dead .
no . i confronted my father about the fire
when he was alive .
it was an accident .
he owned up to the death of the security guard .
he never mentioned a woman .
why do you think the security guard
was in the building ?
he was trying to save my wife .
no one knows the truth , not even raina .
she thinks her mother left me for another man .
when my father died , we were in a good place .
you &apos;re trying to rob me of that .
you &apos;d say anything to hurt me .
perhaps . but i think you know your father well enough
to believe that he was capable of deliberately taking a life .
i hope your stepmother enjoys rotting in jail ,
protecting the legacy of the great bart bass .
yeah , i &apos;ll have the same .
lily turning herself in is already on &quot; gossip girl . &quot;
looks like my fake post of big news turned out to be prophetic .
this is gonna hit the upper east side
like a hurricane .
serena , eric , lily--
they &apos;re gonna need us now more than ever .
and not us . dan and blair-- individual entities ,
two proper nouns separated by a conjunction .
or a comma , if--if mentioned in a list .
which is rare , since we have nothing in common ,
and are , in fact , opposites .
the kind of opposites who do not attract .
most definitely not .
no .
the world just wasn &apos;t ready for a humphrey @-@ waldorf friendship .
it &apos;s been nice not being friends with you .
let &apos;s--let &apos;s not do it again sometime .
hey , everything okay ?
shut it down .
what ?
this .
all of this--shut it down .
thank you for coming down , mr.donovan.
mrs. humphrey has signed a full confession
but has one demand she says is non @-@ negotiable--
that your record be expunged immediately .
i &apos;ll be seeing to it personally .
i know it doesn &apos;t make up for anything--far from it .
but it &apos;s a start--
a fresh start for you .
thank you .
ben ...
my daughter has a good heart--
much bigger than mine .
and she cares for you .
i care for her , too .
i always will .
if you don &apos;t mind my asking ,
you seem in pretty good spirits
for someone facing possible jail time .
do you have kids ?
a boy--max . he &apos;s almost 8 months .
yeah , he does .
well , my kids haven &apos;t smiled at me for a long time ,
and tonight when i told my daughter
i was coming down here ,
she said she was proud of me .
and she smiled .
when we finish up , i &apos;ll wake a judge .
i know our ties to the community .
we won &apos;t object to bail . it &apos;s a good thing
you &apos;ve got an excellent lawyer . you &apos;re gonna need him .
rufus .
hello .
will , what the hell are you doing here ?
cece called me ,
told me about , uh , lily &apos;s situation .
cece called you ?
that &apos;s right . jumped in a helicopter as soon as i heard .
are serena and eric here as well ?
no , they &apos;re not , and i suggest you leave .
i &apos;m not the only one that remembers why you were run
out of town after your last visit .
i appreciate your concern , rufus .
uh , i &apos;ll tell you what . i &apos;ll let cece explain everything .
she &apos;s flying in as soon as she can .
what ?
i don &apos;t think lily quite realizes what she &apos;s in for .
it &apos;s , uh , time to circle the wagons , rufus .
that &apos;s what we do best .
what are you talking about ? it was fouled .
you call that a foul ?
maybe you &apos;re not as smart as you look .
see you upstairs ?
what are you doing here ?
you weren &apos;t returning my calls .
i was hoping you &apos;d come back here .
i didn &apos;t want to leave without saying good @-@ bye .
i &apos;m heading back to chicago ...
tonight .
i &apos;m not coming with you .
i know lily turned herself in ,
but that doesn &apos;t change anything between us .
i wasn &apos;t expecting it to .
i just hope one day ...
you can forgive me .
you &apos;ve grown into an amazing woman , raina .
you &apos;re strong , tough ,
and decent .
and even if you don &apos;t feel proud
to be my daughter right now ...
i &apos;ve never been prouder to be your father .
you look more like your mother every day .
have you seen blair ?
no . she left a while ago . i &apos;m assuming she went home .
chuck , talk to me .
my mom just turned herself in to protect you .
why &apos;d you shut down the party ?
nothing to celebrate .
what are you talking about ? the company is safe .
you &apos;re about to be the head of your father &apos;s empire .
it &apos;s what you &apos;ve always wanted .
what i wanted-- all i ever wanted--
was to know him , for him to let me in .
he lied to me until the day he died .
i need to talk to blair .
she &apos;s the only one who will understand .
understand what ? you &apos;re not making any sense .
chuck , maybe you should go upstairs and get some sleep .
i have to find her .
well , i &apos;ll come with you .
the question of whether we can fight fate
will always remain a mystery .
what are you doing here ?
but the bigger question
is what happens when we stop fighting it ?
i don &apos;t know . is serena here ?
no . what &apos;s going on ? is everything okay ?
i &apos;ve been walking around the city all night
with one all @-@ consuming , paralyzing thought .
&quot; why am i walking around the city
when i live in brooklyn ? &quot;
what if my dad and dorota were right ?
what if there &apos;s another reason
we &apos;re keeping us a secret ?
another reason like what ?
plausible deniability ?
blair , we kept us a secret &apos; cause we were afraid
there was something more .
you need to go back to brooklyn .
not until i know for sure they were wrong ,
that there is nothing between us .
i can guarantee it .
but just so you &apos;re secure in that knowledge ,
what did you have in mind ?
just one kiss , then we can know without a doubt .
i suppose that would work .
one kiss . that &apos;s that .
one kiss , and that &apos;s that .
so ?
so ?
oh , for crying out loud , humphrey .
