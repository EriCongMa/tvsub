I may not agree with the way Ezra lives his life,
but I'm not gonna stand by and let you ruin him.
Alison made my dad this collage,
and there was a picture of her on a boat.
That's the one.
Cece told you she didn't know?
Why did she lie?
I haven't told you guys the truth.
What truth?
Toby and I broke up.
Are you okay?
I'm about to meet my son.
Mona sent you, didn't she?
Spencer, she recognizes self-destructive aggressive behavior.
And who's looking cray cray now, Spencer?
Die!
Stay at my place.
No, I--
Yes. You'll sleep on our couch.
We can make that jump.
No!
Jason!
The patient in bed 3, Jason Dilaurentis.
Where'd he go?
How you holding up, Em?
Don't think I'll be taking an elevator any time soon.
Any word from Jason?
No. Nothing.
Okay, so now that the whole N.A.T. Club is out of Rosewood,
do you think that "A" will retire?
Or just have more time for us.
Way to think positive, Spence.
I just doubt suddenly everything's gonna be lilacs and daffodils.
Guys, let's focus.
Cece lied about knowing Wilden,
and then we find a picture of both of them with Ali.
Yeah, a picture that's gone now.
New rule. Next time we see
anything that might be important to us down the road,
it goes in the phone.
Okay, so is it possible that Cece is...
What are we calling her, red coat?
I never saw a face.
Yeah, me neither.
What do you think, Spencer?
Blonde? Red coat? Captain of the "A" team?
Maybe it's Cece.
Pay attention. We need this brain trust firing on all cylinders.
我们能谈谈今晚的事吗
What happened tonight with you and Wren?
It's nothing. I...
Mona and I had a... moment,
And, uh, he saw, that's all.
A moment that might make her try and cut Emily in half?
No. No, you guys, this wasn't Mona.
We were in a different county.
Well, then who do you think it was?
We're closed.
You're here.
I have the keys.
Yeah, and drinking coffee's not a crime.
What are you doing here?
Looking for you girls.
Wait, you were following us?
Jason Dilaurentis has been saying some nasty things about me.
Like what?
Don't play dumb, Hanna.
It wouldn't be the first time you made up a story.
Well, I don't know what you're talking about.
So why don't you just leave us alone.
It's just a question. No need to get so defensive.
Why don't you ask Cece Drake?
Hanna.
We know about the little boat ride you two took with Alison.
It's late.
We were just leaving.
Care for a ride?
It's not safe this time of night.
We're good.
Oh, and Hanna...
See you around.
Is Caleb having fun with his dad?
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.
After all the hurdles you went through to get them together,
I thought you'd be more enthusiastic.
They're just stripping fixtures at his aunt's house...
Copper pipes are not that exciting.
Am I missing something?
No.
Look, Mom, you're gonna be late for work.
Just get in the car.
What is going on? What?
Hanna, what's going on?
Nothing.
That wasn't nothing.
I-I just know the girl who got in his car.
That doesn't explain the look he just gave you.
I-I don't know, mom, all right?
Wilden's a freak. He hates us.
Hanna, did he talk to you again without me being there?
Because Veronica Hasting said he wasn't allowed--
No, it's fine.
Okay. I'll talk to him myself then.
No!
You're not giving me a choice.
Well, you can't.
We're just trying to figure out why he's always after us.
Okay.
So we were thinking that maybe Wilden and Ali
had a relationship.
What kind of relationship?
Oh, my God, Hanna.
Why did you even go there?
Mom, I told you it was a dumb theory.
No wonder he's upset.
You can't go around saying those things about people,
no matter how much you don't like them.
Well, don't worry about it.
It all started when that girl got in his car,
and I already told Wilden.
So it's over.
How do you even know this person?
She was friends with Ali.
She's a one-woman rumor factory.
All right, well, I don't want you associating with her anymore, okay?
Okay. Never again. Gladly.
I have to go meet Emily.
Oh, my God. You're still in bed?
Mom and dad called.
I didn't tell them you've been skipping school.
Any idea how much longer I'll be covering for you?
If they call again, I'm telling them the truth.
You told your mom?
Don't worry about it. We're fine. I covered for us.
What were you thinking? You can't tell her something like that.
I was distracted by Cece and Wilden, okay?
It doesn't make sense. I thought she was protecting him.
Well, what if we were wrong,
and I just set Ali's baby daddy/killer on her tail?
Why would she lie about knowing him?
We have to find out the truth... confront her.
Where? In Wilden's trunk?
He wouldn't grab her in broad daylight
if he was gonna hurt her.
Probably.
Have you heard from jason?
He texted. He's laying low
at a friend's place in Virginia for a while.
I kinda wish he took me with him.
Did you tell paige that she almost
got two Emilys for the price of one?
Are you kidding?
She's worried enough about me as it is.
Do you think Paige and Caleb have told us everything?
I mean, with them digging into Mona,
do you think they found out something that we could use?
"A" almost killed me. I am not exposing Paige to that.
No, of course not.
But would it hurt to find out
if she picked up anything useful?
Yeah, I-I guess we could go and talk to her after school.
How is Caleb, anyway?
Everything go okay with the reunion?
Yeah. Yeah, mostly.
What part isn't?
I don't know. This weird thing happened.
I put a five dollar bill in the church collection box,
and it had some dice drawn on it.
And later that day, Caleb's dad had it.
You gave money to a church?
Emily, I'm serious.
Do you know how much money has writing on it?
George Washington has dreadlocks on like half my tips.
Yeah, I know, but what if it was the same one.
The guy's an ex-con.
Hanna, do you really think he would steal
from the place that just hired him?
We need to find out the truth.
Hey, Wes.
Look, I think that we should talk--
Ezra.
When did you get back?
3:00 this morning.
I crashed as soon as I got in.
I just woke up.
I haven't been sleeping much the past few weeks.
Yeah, me neither.
I guess I'm just a little confused on why
you never called me on one of those sleepless nights.
Aria, my life turned upside down.
I needed some time to think about things.
Things like us?
For one.
I mean, not about my feelings for you, obviously.
Obviously.
What is that supposed to mean?
Ezra, you've been radio silent ever since you left.
It's given me nothing to do but fear the worst.
That you'd moved on.
No.
Aria, no. If...
if anything, I was trying to be fair to you
and not drag you into the middle of this.
I already am.
And I feel terrible about that.
Because this isn't-- this isn't what you signed up for.
That's not your decision to make, it's mine.
You're right.
You're right. I'm sorry.
I shut you out, and that was wrong.
How was your trip?
"Surreal" definitely comes to mind.
But, uh...
Malcolm's amazing.
He's smart, lively, really artistic.
Did Maggie ever tell you why she kept it a secret?
She did.
My mother paid her to keep quiet.
That's disgusting.
Sorry.
No, no, you're right, and believe me,
I gave her an earful over the phone.
Can I bring you up to speed over dinner?
I never would have said this prior to meeting you,
but I've actually been craving vegan takeout.
I want you in my life, Aria.
Every part of it.
If you're willing.
I just missed you.
I missed you, too.
What happened with Wes?
When you came in, you were on the phone.
Said you needed to talk.
Oh, right, yeah. No, nothing. We, um...
He helped me with a shoot the other night,
and we messed up some stuff at Cece's store.
It was nothing.
OK.
I'm gonna be late for school.
Okay.
Spencer?
Hey. Sorry.
I just wanted to spend my free period in the quiet.
I haven't seen you in a few days.
Yeah. Bad week.
I understand if you don't want me in your classroom.
No, it's okay. I don't mind.
Do you feel like talking?
Well, I guess you've heard...
about Mona.
Mrs. Horowitz wanted you suspended,
but Mona said it was just a misunderstanding.
Spencer, I've known you most of your life.
And you've always been the kind of person
who would bounce back from disappointment.
I've never seen you this down.
Yeah, well, people change.
I'm sorry.
No, don't apologize.
Break-ups are terrible. I get it.
I should probably get going.
Um, if you wanna spend any more of your free periods here,
my door is open.
Thanks, Miss Montgomery.
What's up?
Just heading home.
Rosewood costume shop?
Yeah, I-I thought I'd check in with Shana
about those queen of hearts costumes on the way.
You said you were done with this.
I know. I am.
Liar.
I'm following up.
She said the inventory could take a few weeks.
Great. We'll come with.
Emily, no.
The whole point of this is that I'm protecting you,
not the other way around.
No. Doing things alone is what gets us in trouble. Let's go.
Are you this hard on Caleb?
Seriously? You're looking for sympathy
from the girl who's boyfriend took a bullet in the gut?
Spencer?
Is everything okay?
I know that you're in there.
I'm fine.
Come on, open up the door.
You're not the only one that could use a little "Team Sparia."
Ezra's back.
Spencer...
I know that you don't want a friend right now,
but that doesn't mean that your friends don't need you.
I still don't understand why you care about this costume.
Some girl wore it on the train.
We kinda tangled, and I wanna know who it was.
I'm Shana, by the way.
Paige forgot her manners.
Emily.
Oh, so it's you in the flesh.
I'm Hanna.
About that costume...
Yeah, I checked. We can't give out that information.
It'd be my ass.
You didn't think to mention this on the phone?
Must have slipped my mind.
I didn't realize you'd be bringing your girlfriends.
Do you have a restroom?
In the back.
Thanks.
So where are the queen of hearts costumes, anyway?
I wanna see what all the fuss is about.
Over here.
Wow!
This is really pretty.
What is this, silk?
Try polyester.
I'm really into fashion.
Okay, I'd love to chat, but--
No!
Wait. Um...
What's this?
Little boy Blue.
Yeah, I really, really love this color.
I have to get that.
While you're with a customer?
What is wrong with you?
Costumes.
Let's go.
Aria.
Mrs. Fitzgerald.
I wanted to thank you.
Whatever you said or did, it worked.
Wesley's come home.
He's going to be finishing the year at Dillard.
Oh. Uh, I didn't do anything.
Well, in any event, he's back where he belongs.
Do you mind if I sit?
I know we didn't get off on the right foot,
but your generosity toward my son
in the midst of all this does mean something.
Yeah, well, Wes needed a place to stay.
I wasn't gonna leave him out on the street.
I meant Ezra.
Wes stayed with you?
I take it you've spoken with Ezra.
I really don't wanna get into the middle of this.
I know this may sound hard to believe,
but I was acting in Ezra's best interest.
He was in high school.
Just think of yourself, Aria.
How would you feel waking up to that kind of responsibility?
My parents respect me enough to involve me in the decision.
I'm sure they do.
I must admit, I admire your courage--
Staying with Ezra while his life turns upside down.
It will change things, to say the least.
Especially for someone like Ezra.
You know he'll make Malcolm the center of his life.
And there's Maggie...
Well, I won't keep you.
I love you, too.
Caleb's gonna try and I.D. the credit card numbers
when he gets back from his aunt's house.
What's wrong?
Do you think Toby would ever cheat on Spencer?
Wait, what?
It's the only thing I can think of
that might explain how upset she's been.
Toby is as loyal as a labrador. I don't think he'd cheat.
And neither would Paige.
Who said anything about Paige?
Uh, your face.
I was only worried about it
when I saw her with Shana.
There was some serious tension in that room.
Look, I know, and it's all my fault.
I should have never put that thought in your head.
Are you even sure Shana's gay? She barely looked at me.
That's the criteria?
I'm just saying.
You should have seen those chicks fighting over me at the bar.
Anyway, it's like me and Caleb's dad.
Just because we've all gotten in the habit of
thinking the worst of people
doesn't mean it true.
Is everything okay?
Ezra's back.
And so is Miss Fitz-Scary.
Oh, I didn't order that.
I did.
Boyfriend busy?
I am not gonna discuss my personal life with you.
I'm just trying to make small talk.
Yet something tell me that I should talk with my lawyer present.
No, there's no need to make it official.
All right. You wanna talk? Talk.
Don't get upset. I'm here as a friend.
But we're not friends.
We have a history.
A history that's ancient, as far as I'm concerned.
Listen, I know my record isn't spotless,
especially with you,
but I take my job very seriously.
I don't want anything to get in the way,
especially something outrageous.
Outrageous?
Teenagers aren't aware of the ramifications of what they say.
If it's outrageous, why do you seem so nervous?
In a town like this,
an accusation like that would be the end of me.
Is there any truth to it?
Of course not.
What do you think?
I think you bought a glass of wine for the wrong person.
Do you mind if I join you?
No.
I was hoping we could discuss our little road trip.
Look, I was wrong.
You wanted to help me and I used you to get at Mona.
I'm sorry.
You shouldn't be.
I deserved to be used.
Look, I'd be lying if I said I came to you
purely in the name of mental health.
Mona had told me about your break-up,
and I think...
I think that part of me hoped that with Toby out of the picture,
that I finally stood a chance.
But it was wrong of me to try and swoop in so quickly.
I let feelings cloud my judgment.
And I'm sorry.
Thanks.
Your anger toward Mona...
is she the one who came between you and Toby?
Yeah, you could say that.
Forgive me. It's none of my business.
I'll leave you.
Wren, wait.
It may have been about Mona,
but something good came out of it.
It was nice
being with you.
I'm glad I'm not the only one of us who thought so.
Do you fancy taking another stab at dinner?
Anywhere but Lewisburg?
Since when do you care what that hose-beast thinks?
She wasn't wrong, Han.
Now with Malcolm and Maggie in the picture,
everything's gonna be complicated.
God, how did this even happen?
I mean, I'm actually having
a conversation about my boyfriend's son.
It's like my relationship
went from high school to minivan overnight.
And now-now I have to go to his apartment
and have dinner with him and act like everything's okay.
Okay, Aria, take a deep breath.
Yeah, you have to give it more than ten minutes.
You guys have been through so much.
I know.
Okay, but don't you think
it's a little weird that he didn't call?
I mean, Wes even thought that was strange.
Hold up. His little brother?
Aria, is there something that you're not telling us?
What? No.
Okay, yes, fine, maybe I went there
for like 2.5 seconds, but no.
No, I just missed Ezra.
It seems like you're talking to everyone in that family
except for the one that matters.
It was this beautiful crystal paperweight,
with these lavender petals suspended inside.
I never would have pegged you as a thief.
Well, I was a terrible one.
I felt so guilty, as soon as I got home from my nana's house,
that I actually--
I buried it in the backyard.
It's probably still there.
I hate to cut the night short,
but I promised a colleague I'd cover his shift for him.
Oh, go. Save some lives.
I had a lovely night.
Yeah, I did, too.
I'm sorry.
I hardly think that's fair.
I'll be on my way.
Are you sure you don't want to tell Aria
about how hiding my son from me was in everyone's best interest?
Best interest. That's what you called it, right, mom?
Malcolm's every need has been seen to.
Oh, god. You're unbelievable.
I can go...
No, no, no. Stay, stay.
We can continue this another time.
Like when I'm alone?
So you can try to manipulate Aria out of my life again?
Ezra, it's okay.
No, it's not okay.
I'm so sick of this.
I'm not going to apologize for loving you.
And I'm sure as hell not
going to let you swoop into my son's life
and pretend the past seven years never happened.
Well, you've made your feelings perfectly clear.
You're forgetting something.
The key. I know you had one made.
I am so sorry that you had to see that.
Any idea why Shana got in trouble
for Emailing Confidential Information?
I needed to find out who rented those costumes.
So badly you're willing to risk somebody's job?
It's complicated, okay?
Try me.
There's more to this than you're letting on.
Is it something about Mona?
Did she kill Garrett?
I don't know!
Look, I know you and Caleb are trying to bust her,
but this might be bigger than Mona, okay?
She could be working for someone.
Someone like who?
That's what we're trying to find out.
At first we thought it was Cece,
but now--now we don't know what to think.
Why didn't you tell me this?
'Cause I was being protective.
Same as you and Caleb.
Now it's your turn.
Shana?
Em...
No, we can't be half honest.
I saw the way you two looked at each other............
We dated...
This summer, while you were working in Haiti.
Three weeks.
If it was over, why would you lie about it?
Because I didn't wanna hurt you.
Emily, believe me.
It's over.
She was a substitute,
at a time when I never thought I'd get the real thing.
I love you.
Hey, Hanna. It's me.
I just saw Wilden.
We need to talk about what you told me earlier, okay?
Call me as soon as you get this.
Love you. Bye.
What'd it take to get you out of bed?
I... Just needed some fresh air.
Spencer...
I know it's none of my business,
but no company is better than bad company.
What's that supposed to mean?
I bought Wren that cologne.
Hey... Don't you wanna give that to goodwill or something?
Knowing my mother, there's probably is a tracking device on that.
Does Malcolm know that you're his dad?
Not yet.
It's a big step, but we're trying to ease him into the idea.
Well, whatever you decide, I'm here for you.
Thank you.
So if my memory serves me correct,
I'm pretty sure that I won the last movie night coin toss,
which means that we are watching anything but Chinatown.
One of these nights you are going to
stay awake through the entire movie.
One of these nights is not tonight.
I'm gonna make popcorn.
Hey, what's up?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down, slow down.
No. No, it's okay. I got time.
It's Maggie.
Is everything okay?
Uh, I don't know, uh, but we will figure something out.
What's wrong?
My mom owns Maggie's condo, and she's selling it.
What?
No, no, no, no. Look, that's not gonna happen.
Look, you got rights and nothing--
Nothing's gonna happen overnight.
Is here a problem?
Have you been drinking?
What are you doing?
Just answer the question.
You know very well I haven't.
I know you had a drink at the table.
Please step out of the car.
Where are you going with this?
Are you refusing an order from an officer of the law?
Step out of the car please.
We need to talk about Hanna.
Can you keep Hanna quiet or not?
If you wanna continue this discussion, call my lawyer.
I'm not the only one with secrets.
You talk, I talk,
And you could lose a lot more than your boyfriend.
Don't threaten me.
Hey... Let go of me!
This is nothing compared to what I'll do if Hanna talks.
I wonder how your lieutenant will respond
when he hears you're threatening a child.
He's not going to.
Think this through, Ashley.
How do you live with yourself?
Hey, we're not done here!
Get out of my way!
I can't let you go!
Get out of my way!
Either you shut Hanna up, or I will!
Cece?
Where are you going?
Anywhere. Fast.
Is this about Wilden?
Ya think?
Emily, I thought you could keep a secret.
Is there anyone in this town that you didn't tell?
I saw a picture of you, Wilden, and Ali on a sailboat.
Yeah, she thought he was cute,
so she asked him if he'd take us for a ride.
Then why lie about it?
I don't have time to talk about this!
You're not the only one that's scared, okay?
Please. If there's something I need to know...
I thought Wilden got Ali pregnant
and killed her to keep it a secret.
So is it true?
I don't know what's true.
Wilden's sure going out of his way to deny it,
And if there's one thing Ali could do,
it's tell a good lie.
If you thought he killed her, why not turn him in?
Oh, to who? One of his pals on the force?
I didn't know who I could trust.
Jason said he saw you at his house
the night Ali disappeared.
He told you that?
God, this is so messed up.
Why were you there?
Ali called.
She was freaking out about some videos.
Everyone wanted them.
Spencer's big sister more than anyone.
When I showed up, she begged me to talk to Ali.
So I did. Then Ali left to go get them.
Next day... she was missing.
Who took that picture?
You three on the sailboat. Who took it?
Melissa hastings.
Melissa!
Melissa!
Melissa!
Help! Melissa!
Somebody, please!
Melissa! Can you hear me?!
Melissa, please!
Melissa!
Please!
Melissa!
Somebody, please!
What happened?
What happened?
God, Mom! You almost gave me a heart attack!
Mom, what's wrong?
I think I might have killed detective Wilden.
I'm gonna stay with you tonight.
Thank God I got your text.
This was revenge.
For what happened with Mona?
For hooking up with Wren.
You...?
It's a long story.
Why would Mona care about you and Wren?
Can you call Hanna and Emily?
I need them to come over.
Sure. Why?
I know who's helping Mona.
I don't want you seeing this.
Look, I'm not letting you do this alone.
Mom... where's Wilden?
I don't know.
