uh , what &apos;s happening right now ?
max , are you smoking crack ?
it &apos;s not crack , it &apos;s lipstick .
i can afford crack .
i &apos;m at the end of my good lipstick and i can &apos;t afford
to buy a new one so i &apos;m going all breaking bad .
&quot; breaking bad &quot; ?
we &apos;re more like broke and sad .
you &apos;re freebasing lipstick and look ,
this heel is starting to wobble .
here , stick this in and hold it .
i swear i &apos;ve said that before ,
but i don &apos;t think it was about shoes .
yo , dollface . it &apos;s been ten minutes !
his chowder , my spaghetti .
where &apos;s the food ?
&quot; where &apos;s the food &quot; ?
where &apos;s your neck ?
i wasn &apos;t listening . i was looking at your boobs .
well , i do what i can
but they &apos;ll never be as big as yours .
pick up . meatball .
hey , hot stuff . where &apos;s the hot stuff ?
oh , max . you were right .
this heel is much more--no .
no , wait ! no , it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s gonna--
those are the biggest balls those guys have had
in their laps since they started steroids .
i can &apos;t believe you masking taped the shoe to your leg .
i know but these are christian louboutins and
even all busted up like this they still have
the classic red bottoms .
you know what else has red bottoms ?
baboons .
walk around with a couple of them on your feet
and i &apos;m impressed .
well , at least now you can &apos;t see those stupid bows .
who put bows on their shoes ?
what &apos;s the gift ? your stinky feet ?
you don &apos;t think i hate the bows ?
i bought these as an impulse purchase over a year ago .
i didn &apos;t know i &apos;d be shackled with them for eternity .
oh , caroline .
i never noticed you had a club foot .
i would have set you up with my brother .
i broke my shoe in the diner .
oh , i can help .
i always carry my gym shoes in my bag .
i &apos;m sorry they &apos;re so conservative
but the weight room is a real meat rack .
sophie , that &apos;s so sweet of you .
but i still have one pair of my own shoes to wear .
oh , well take them just in case .
you should take them .
you &apos;ll make $ 20 just walking to work .
and some of your mail got mixed in with mine .
this is like the third time that mail lady did that .
all right . nighty night .
max , you will not believe what just came addressed to you .
let me explain . i &apos;m not a scientologist .
i just went that one time because i heard
some rich guy was looking for a wife .
no , we &apos;ve been pre @-@ approved for a credit card .
what ? how the hell did we get pre @-@ approved ?
it says all we have to do is go online and apply
and we can be approved in under two minutes .
slow down , quasimodo .
i can &apos;t have a credit card .
someone gave me a bag of chips ahoy cookies once
and i ate the entire thing without breathing .
well , you &apos;re not a child anymore .
you have more discipline .
the cookies were yesterday .
okay , what is that thing ? what is that spinning wheel ?
it &apos;s just processing our application .
no , it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s finding out everything about us .
now it &apos;s finding out your dad stole millions of dollars .
now it &apos;s finding out i got fired from eight dairy queens .
now it &apos;s finding out why i got fired from eight dairy queens .
oh , my god . max , we &apos;re approved .
we &apos;ve just been approved .
what ? what is wrong with them ?
does dairy queen report nothing ?
get back on there and disapprove us .
okay . calm down .
we need this card for our business .
all we have to do is communicate with each other
about every purchase , you know ?
keep an open dialogue .
so , opening dialogue .
for our business , i would like a pair of louboutins .
opening dialogue . no .
and i felt stupid miming that . i hate the arts .
look , you can &apos;t get everything you want .
i would like a box of lizards .
love lizards , always have ,
but you don &apos;t see me putting that on a credit card .
i need a new pair of shoes for business meetings .
you know what they say ,
&quot; dress for the job you want , not the job you have . &quot;
okay , fine .
if you &apos;re getting the shoes , then i &apos;m getting what i want .
i hope you &apos;re happy with an apartment
full of lizards and lipstick .
also , some of those lizards will be wearing lipstick .
earl , you are looking particularly gorgeous this evening .
well , i would say , &quot; don &apos;t flatter me &quot; but let &apos;s face it .
everything came together tonight .
is it another woman ? should i be filled with anger ?
i mean , more than i usually am ?
i just want to look nice for my son when he comes in .
what ? no way , i &apos;m going to meet your kid ?
well , one of them .
&quot; one of them &quot; ? how many do you have ?
so far ?
oh , earl , i love you .
this is my son , darius .
he &apos;s the number one chrysler salesman in all of detroit ,
and he &apos;s my very favorite ,
if he &apos;s the one i &apos;m thinking of .
excuse me , but aren &apos;t you max
of max &apos;s homemade cupcakes ?
earl , look .
our credit card came in the mail today .
see ? &quot; max black . &quot;
no more using the card i found at six flags .
thank you for never checking your statement , agnes chin .
girls , take my advice
and be very careful with that thing .
credit cards are more trouble
than a priest at a wiggles concert .
yes , earl .
i can &apos;t believe it . a credit card for our business .
so when are we getting the shoes and lizards ?
max , remember .
we have to be grown @-@ ups about this .
of course .
&quot; two lizards , please . no , make it three . &quot;
hi , i &apos;m looking for earl .
and no , i &apos;m not here to return a bag of skunky weed .
oh , my god . i &apos;m so excited to see you .
come on in , i &apos;ll take really , really good care of you .
oh , you need to know i just separated from my wife ,
so i &apos;m a little vulnerable .
she &apos;s not usually this nice to customers .
she &apos;s just excited .
she &apos;s about to come into some lizards .
yeah , again .
i &apos;ve been out the dating pool for a while ,
so everything sound like a sexual innuendo to me .
he is not a customer . look at him .
don &apos;t you see the resemblance ?
oh , my god is he your father ?
yes . he &apos;s my father .
and my mother is a piece of chalk .
daddy !
thank god , it is the one i thought .
there &apos;s my little boy !
so , darius , what was earl like as a dad ?
it must have been great , huh ?
i bet he packed the coolest lunches .
a joint for recess , and a gin and juice box .
oh , yeah , yeah . he was a great dad .
i mean , he was always there .
except for my childhood .
you &apos;ve gotta laugh !
earl is sitting right there .
well , it &apos;s a joke . take it easy there , fun size .
han , take no offense .
he &apos;s just pulling your leg a little .
darius has always been funny .
why am i thinking about terrence ?
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;m the funny one , dad .
i don &apos;t recall there being a terrence in our family ,
but then again , i don &apos;t know how far you &apos;ve thrown your seed .
you &apos;ve gotta laugh .
do you ?
darius was voted the funniest salesman
at the chrysler dealership .
yes , i was . and that &apos;s why i quit my job .
to pursue my dream to become a comedian .
see ? see , he &apos;s funny .
always making jokes .
that &apos;s not a joke , daddy .
no , no , that &apos;s why i &apos;m in town .
to audition at the comedy club tomorrow night .
i already got my stage name .
&quot; darius the hilarious . &quot;
i think it &apos;s a good choice , right ?
is it ?
well , obviously , big d ,
we will all be there to support you .
will we ?
hold up , darius . how did all of this happen ?
well , i mean , i knew a guy at cadillac
who knew a guy at toyota who knew a guy at subaru
who sold the club owner a dodge .
and then he hit a kid with it .
the kid should have dodged .
you gotta laugh !
there &apos;s a dead kid in the mix and we got to laugh ?
it &apos;s not his fault he &apos;s not funny .
we put his sense of humor on a high shelf .
hey , max , you know ,
daddy always told me you were special ,
and now i see it .
and it &apos;s not just because you think everything i say is funny .
you feel like family .
i do ?
oh , i always wanted a brother ...
who was a brother .
max , do you expect me to wait on all the tables tonight ?
well , i am kind of in the middle of
my family reunion right now .
and where is mr. hilarious &apos; soup ?
look at blondie , here . she &apos;s like ,
&quot; oh my god , do black people even eat soup ? &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s like , whatever . &quot;
that is a dead @-@ on caroline .
is it ?
here is your order ticket from tonight .
this pile is for the people who found hair .
these are the hairs that the people found .
oh , you sound russian .
that &apos;s funny because you &apos;re not rushin &apos; to make my soup .
no , no , no , no . i &apos;m kidding you , man .
i get it . you &apos;re just too busy back there
not putting on deodorant .
you gotta laugh .
do you ?
max , i might be crazy but now i feel like
the heel of this shoe &apos;s starting to--
oh , gosh . now i got to go wipe this down .
you know , i was going to wear this for my audition .
and that &apos;s gotta go well .
yes , it does .
because son , there are two jobs in detroit ,
and you just quit one of them .
don &apos;t worry , daddy . i &apos;ll make you proud .
all right ? you &apos;ll see .
daddy &apos;s been wrong before .
he didn &apos;t think i could make it on soul train ,
but there i was ,
in the bottom left corner on soul train .
i feel so terrible .
well , you know we have to buy him a new shirt .
max , i &apos;ve made seven dollars so far .
we can &apos;t afford to buy him a shirt .
we can go shopping for a reasonable shirt .
we have to . he &apos;s family .
is he ?
and i have to say , i don &apos;t like that brand of put @-@ down humor .
and that blonde stereotype ?
i mean , i don &apos;t even say &quot; whatever . &quot;
but , you know , it &apos;s fine . whatever .
max , slow down .
i can &apos;t walk any faster in sophie &apos;s giant sneakers .
i can &apos;t believe she benches 250 in these .
oh , my god .
my hand just touched the subway floor .
how do i know someone didn &apos;t pee here ?
oh , honey , i &apos;ve peed here .
this is new york . it &apos;s made of pee .
and pee hand is what you get for refusing to wear flat shoes .
no way .
i &apos;m living so close to the gutter as it is .
i can &apos;t risk being any shorter .
here &apos;s where we &apos;re meeting darius .
&quot; subway style . &quot;
every time i walk by this place i wonder
&quot; who would ever shop here ? &quot;
now i know -- us .
first my heel breaks ,
and now i &apos;m shopping underground .
how much lower can i get ?
brunch on the earth &apos;s core ?
oh . excuse my mouthful .
mm , i wasn &apos;t expecting ladies .
we usually just sell to pimps and pastors .
what can i help you dolls with ?
actually , we &apos;re just here meeting a friend .
we &apos;re going to help him pick out a shirt .
oh , that guy ?
he &apos;s already in the dressing room trying one on now .
now , listen , if the price is too high ,
you and i can , uh , negotiate .
or you .
i still can &apos;t believe we &apos;re using our tip money
to buy him a shirt .
we &apos;re only going to spend like $ 40 .
and you heard the man . it can go down .
if you go down .
oh , hey ladies . there you are .
look , i switched it up a little bit .
do you like me in pink ?
my boyfriend does .
he says it makes my cheeks look rosy , all four of them .
you gotta laugh , you gotta laugh !
darius , we &apos;re family ,
so i &apos;m just going to tell you like it is .
that material feels a little funky .
i mean , that kind of humor might have worked over at toyota--
it &apos;s chrysler .
whatever .
but this is new york .
there are a lot of people , be them gays , or blondes ,
who might take offense to that .
i mean , i don &apos;t , but , whatever .
oh , no , no , no . i was just playing .
that &apos;s not the kind of stuff i &apos;m gonna do in my act tonight .
no , i wrote some real jokes with a comic back home .
and , he &apos;s jewish , so you know it &apos;s gonna be funny .
and not cheap .
again , see ? that &apos;s the kind of stuff ...
caroline , come on . it &apos;s so wrong it &apos;s right .
look , i have the jokes right here .
let &apos;s take them on a little test drive and see how they do .
all right ? so back it up , ladies .
you going to need some laughing room .
this is going to be hilarious .
anybody here have a smart car ?
because i don &apos;t think it &apos;s smart to drive half a car .
that was new , i &apos;ll keep working on it .
all right , let &apos;s try another one .
you know what , maybe we weren &apos;t back far enough .
yeah !
yeah , that feels funnier already , right caroline ?
all right .
you know who doesn &apos;t drive a smart car ?
smart people . they don &apos;t do it .
you gotta laugh .
seriously .
you &apos;ve got to . i &apos;ve got a lot riding on this .
i just got it .
oh , my god . he stinks .
he stinks on ice . darius is gonna bomb tonight
and worse , he &apos;s going to bomb in front of earl .
and earl &apos;s pretty sure that &apos;s the son he &apos;s most proud of .
you &apos;re right . what are we gonna do ?
now i know you lovely ladies came in for a shirt ,
but can i interest you in a nice suit ?
look at this one . it &apos;s a classic .
you can &apos;t get this color above ground .
that &apos;s it . darius needs a suit .
all the professional comedians wear suits ,
and like you said ,
you have to dress for the job you want .
and with jokes like that ,
he needs the funniest suit they have .
do you have anything from the sinbad collection ?
i do .
max , i don &apos;t think the suit &apos;s gonna be enough .
i think he needs something else ,
you know , like , a puppet .
a puppet ?
that &apos;s exactly what he needs .
i went out with a guy last night .
asked me if we could go dutch .
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; what &apos;s dutch for cheap @-@ ass bitch ? &quot;
you kick him to the curb !
we &apos;ll be right back ,
because mama &apos;s gotta go put her feet up .
uh , miss ?
can we get another round when you get a chance ?
another round ?
and keep them coming until we can no longer see .
put it on my card .
you got it .
man , that feels good every time .
hey , max . just because
you &apos;re buying me drinks
doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;m going to put out .
my celery stick is my microphone at the comedy club !
i &apos;m here , i &apos;m here .
did you get the puppet ?
oh , i &apos;ve got the puppet .
hey , come on in .
hey , girls . how you doing ?
darius the hilarious is pumped .
i &apos;m totally in my zone right now .
and i can &apos;t miss in this suit .
well ...
darius , that &apos;s what we wanted to talk to you about .
you know we &apos;re big fans .
big , big fans .
you &apos;re amazing , your act &apos;s incredible .
you are darius the hilarious .
max and i love the smart car stuff .
it &apos;s hilarious , per your name .
but , well , it is new york .
not a lot of people are smart , or have cars .
yeah , you know new york .
not exactly the cutting edge .
so , after max and i left you , we had a thought .
we got you a puppet .
and , yes , i was stoned .
but caroline was laughing just as hard as me .
you got me a what ?
a puppet . we got you a puppet .
but i don &apos;t use a puppet .
until you do .
just imagine , at the end of your act
or in the beginning ...
or all the way through .
ladies and gentlemen , darius the hilarious
and his partner , justin beaver !
&quot; damn , girl . and i mean dam . &quot;
&quot; as in , i built one . &quot;
and you don &apos;t even have to be funny because
justin beaver does the work for you .
show him , max .
&quot; i &apos;m straight . &quot;
you gotta laugh !
do i ?
i mean , honestly ?
making fun of justin beaver &apos;s sexuality ?
i find that a tad offensive .
this next act comes to us from the motor city .
please give it up for mr. darius the hilarious .
all right . how &apos;s everybody doing tonight ?
who out there has a smart car ?
because i don &apos;t think it &apos;s smart to drive a half a car .
you gotta laugh .
oh , no . i ran out of fake laughter .
yeah , i mean , smart car .
have you seen this thing ?
it &apos;s like you driving around in a backpack .
you gotta laugh .
do we ?
why don &apos;t we have a smart car write some jokes for you ?
yeah , well , i can see why you would defend the smart car .
it &apos;s the only car your feet can reach the pedals in .
yeah , but that &apos;s so true . he &apos;s very short !
as is the car . it all lines up .
look at this gray @-@ haired scrub , man .
apparently black do crack .
hey , don kng called .
said he want his whole head back .
max , look . look how proud earl is .
hey , hey , hey , blondie .
you mind not talking until i finish ?
wait , a minute . you &apos;re probably just thinking ,
&quot; oh , my god . shoes , shoes , hairbrush , shoes . &quot;
oh , my god .
i actually was thinking about shoes !
i &apos;m sorry , there &apos;s a problem with your card .
it &apos;s been declined .
max .
darius told me what you did and that was awful nice of you .
now , here . i am reimbursing you
for all of the clothes and for that damn puppet .
although i swore i would never pay for beaver .
do you think he &apos;ll ever make it , earl ?
who &apos;s to say nowadays , max ?
america &apos;s got talent . do they ?
all i know is he &apos;s my kid , and you went out of your way
to try and help him .
well , i just wanted you to be proud .
i am , max . very proud .
i just talked to visa .
i think they were disappointed they had pre @-@ approved us .
look , i killed it . i had to .
it was telling me to buy a harley .
okay , open dialogue .
i used the credit card for one more thing yesterday .
open dialogue . so did i.
it &apos;s the fanciest lipstick payless had .
and here .
max , are there lizards in that bag ?
i wish .
they &apos;re as good as new and no bows .
max , where &apos;d you find a cobbler ?
a cobbler ?
i took a time machine .
i was supposed to kill hitler ,
but i thought your shoes were more important .
okay , let &apos;s cut up your card .
we should keep one for business emergencies .
we just have to have to put it someplace where
we &apos;ll never be tempted to reach for it .
oleg , would you put this down your pants ?
no problem .
