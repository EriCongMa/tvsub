dying changes everything .
there &apos;s the emotional fallout , sure .
but there &apos;s also the practical stuff .
who &apos;s going to do your job ?
who &apos;s going to take care of your family ?
the only good thing for you is ,
you don &apos;t have to worry about it .
people you never knew will be living in your house ,
working your job .
the world just keeps on going ...
without you .
steph , i need a favor .
i &apos;ll do your scut for a week--
two weeks-- and before you say no ,
i just want to say that you look really pretty today .
and you &apos;re the most talented intern in our class ,
and i &apos;m in no way trying to butter you up .
so you don &apos;t say no .
no .
you don &apos;t even know what i &apos;m asking you yet .
yes , i do . i &apos;m not going anywhere near medusa for you .
i want to live so i will say it again--no .
nothing to be scared of .
she &apos;s just an attending .
we only call her medusa because--
because she &apos;s a monster of mythic proportions .
what &apos;s the problem ?
i have these labs for dr. grey .
well , then give them to her .
i &apos;ve been waiting for those for over an hour .
i had to do an admission--
stop making excuses .
sorry .
stop apologizing .
stop talking .
his lactic acid is normal . what does that tell us ?
you can talk now .
that he &apos;s probably not septic ,
so he &apos;s gonna be fine .
although his white cell count is elevated
so i should probably keep an eye on that .
in fact , i will keep an eye on that so that he doesn &apos;t go--
go to the pit and try not to kill anybody .
impressive .
i would &apos;ve expected that level of intimidation from yang maybe .
not you .
how is yang , by the way ? does she like minnesota ?
she loves it .
dr. parker .
and that was before i realized ...
dr. parker .
that there was a tumor in there .
i mean , we had spent , uh , three hours
trying to deal with the valve--
dr. parker .
oh , dr. yang .
you &apos;ve gotta hear about this case dr. thomas had--
must be what , ten years ago ?
um , i looked at the oberman baby &apos;s scans .
uh , i know we discussed doing a thoracotomy ,
but i think a v.a.t.s. makes more sense .
fantastic .
but let dr. thomas tell you about this story first .
you &apos;re not gonna believe your ears .
how about i scrub in with you
and then i can tell you the whole story ?
when &apos;s your surgery ?
11 : 00
oh , that won &apos;t work . i have a bypass at 11 : 00 .
oh .
why don &apos;t you move your surgery back
and then i can join you ?
uh , that &apos;s really not necessary .
and then you will be able to , uh , watch my 11 : 00 .
it &apos;s a port @-@ cabg . have you ever seen one ?
i &apos;ve done one . three in fact .
well , then you &apos;ll appreciate my approach .
it &apos;s even better .
well , wait a minute . where are you going ?
my ambulance isn &apos;t here yet .
i can start the story now .
the patient was 66 .
although i suppose i should start
when i first met the man .
just wanted to let you know , we &apos;re all set for tonight .
unless you had some questions or concerns .
i don &apos;t .
okay . um ...
5 : 00
okay .
how often should her calcium levels be monitored ?
every 12 hours .
and what &apos;s the primary cause of hypocalcemia
after parathyroid surgery ?
really ?
are you telling me not one of you knows that--
hungry bone syndrome ...
where calcium and phosphorus are rapidly deposited into the bone .
you &apos;re not supposed to be here .
got a last @-@ minute flight .
couldn &apos;t pass it up .
you aren &apos;t on call tonight ?
not anymore .
i switched shifts .
what &apos;s your turnaround this time ?
12 hours . and i plan to make use of every single one .
occupied .
mm . i don &apos;t want you to go .
listen ... i wish i could put off hopkins
so you and i could spend more time together ,
but i &apos;ve already postponed them once .
mm . i know , but it doesn &apos;t mean i have to like it .
i really hate good @-@ byes .
well , you &apos;ll like this one .
okay , what did i say about the staring ?
i &apos;m fine , and even if i weren &apos;t ,
staring at me wouldn &apos;t make me more fine .
i &apos;m sorry , dr. torres .
really , avery ? you too ?
no , not staring . uh , definitely not .
excuse me .
okay , what do we got ?
hey , you tell me .
looks like a transverse process fracture
at l @-@ 3 , l @-@ 4 , but see this swelling ?
i can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s unstable or not .
it &apos;s unstable for sure .
book an o.r. , we need to get in there
and relieve the pressure as soon as possible .
wait . &quot; we &quot; ?
as in you and me ?
it &apos;s no big deal .
actually , it is . it &apos;s ... it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s a very big deal .
i &apos;ve been cleared for surgery for weeks .
yeah , i know , &apos; cause i cleared you ,
but you said you weren &apos;t ready s ...
well , now i &apos;m saying i am .
okay .
again , it &apos;s no big deal .
it is a big deal .
i will be done long before 5 : 00 .
that &apos;s not the point .
why are you putting this pressure on yourself ?
i &apos;ve been practicing for weeks . i feel good .
i just can &apos;t sit around looking at the clock .
you really need to do this today ?
yeah , i do ...
especially today .
i mean , he says he &apos;s ready .
and his nerve graft seems to be ready .
so i guess today &apos;s the day he &apos;s gonna operate ...
with his brand @-@ new hand .
and it is gonna work . it &apos;s definitely gonna work .
you think it &apos;s gonna work , right ?
i thought i might find you in here .
i keep thinking if i say something big enough
or ... shocking enough ,
he &apos;ll just ... he &apos;ll open his eyes .
7 hours till 5 : 00 .
his directive was very specific .
if , after 30 days , there are no signs of recovery ,
mark wanted to be let go .
that &apos;s all we &apos;re doing ...
honoring his wish .
i know . i just ...
oh , god . it &apos;s so hot in here .
i think i &apos;m gonna take off my shirt .
oh , yeah . that &apos;s better .
oh , yeah , it &apos;s so much cooler with my boobs out .
well , if that didn &apos;t wake him , i don &apos;t know what will .
yeah .
you always had to be the first .
you are a terrible best man .
addison &apos;s great ,
but one woman for the rest of your life ?
it &apos;s not what god intended .
especially for men who look like us .
god intended for us many , many women ,
a staggering number of women .
i just hope you didn &apos;t forget the rings .
derek ... you &apos;re lucky to have me .
you will never , ever find another friend
as good as me , ever .
hey , are you filming this ?
okay , we &apos;re not doing this , okay ?
i &apos;m not gonna be in one of your videos ...
so you can put it on your creepy bookcase
with all your other creepy videos .
there &apos;s no bookcase .
and i &apos;ve never done this either ,
but trust me , what &apos;s about to happen ,
you &apos;re gonna want to relive over and over .
one second .
the intern appy ... you got your guy ?
i have someone in mind .
and you really want to do this today ?
especially today .
okay .
grey . hey .
i need you to take my 3 : 00 lap chole .
oh , i can &apos;t . i have the intern appy .
grey , living up to your nickname .
nickname ? i have a nickname ?
they call you medusa ...
the serpent @-@ haired monster who turns folks to stone .
hey , this is not a bad thing .
you want to be the attending with the scary nickname .
it keeps your residents in line .
it strikes fear in their heart .
take it from the nazi , it &apos;s good to be feared .
you retired the nazi .
they call you something else now .
they do ?
they do .
excuse me , dr. parker , quick question .
okay , hands up , everybody .
one , two , three .
what can we do for you , dr. yang ?
oh , i ... i didn &apos;t mean for you to stop your procedure .
you can just keep going while i talk .
we can &apos;t , actually .
we find that multitasking leads to errors in hearing
and errors in healing .
okay . well , dr. thomas invited himself onto my v.a.t.s.
this afternoon ... the oberman baby .
i was wondering if i could do the procedure on my own ,
without him .
how come ?
uh , well ... dr. thomas is a big talker and ...
oh , my gosh . that is the truth .
dr. thomas can chew your ear right off .
i ... i tell you , once he cornered me with a story .
i was on my way to the gentlemen &apos;s room .
i hate to invoke potty humor ,
but i wasn &apos;t sure i was gonna make it .
that &apos;s how long the story was .
exactly . so ...
my advice to you is , visit the ladies room
before you enter his proximity . yes .
i will , but another solution would be
if he just didn &apos;t scrub in .
you &apos;ve got a tough row to hoe there , dr. yang .
no doubt about it .
thankfully , you &apos;re a tough cookie .
you &apos;re up to the task .
we salute you .
guess what . i have a nickname .
medusa . i &apos;m medusa grey .
i had to push my flight tonight .
okay .
it &apos;s not what you &apos;re thinking . it &apos;s not like last time
or the time before that .
my surgery got pushed . that &apos;s it .
i &apos;m on standby for a later flight .
it &apos;s okay if you &apos;re not ready to fly .
i said i &apos;d come . i &apos;ll be there .
well , you won &apos;t make it by 5 : 00 anyway ,
so why push yourself ?
i will be there , medusa .
oh , so you did hear me ?
i like it .
snakes in the hair--hot !
okay , bye .
cristina &apos;s coming tonight ?
she &apos;ll never make it by 5 : 00,
but she says she &apos;s gonna be here .
she &apos;s not gonna get on that plane , is she ?
we &apos;re working on it .
probably not .
you really doing the intern appy ?
jealous ?
he &apos;s too busy just doing the interns .
are you gonna say good @-@ bye to your fan club before you leave ?
i &apos;ve been saying good @-@ bye all day .
gross .
they &apos;re gonna be sad to see me go .
you may have to step up , avery . comfort them a little .
no sloppy seconds for me , thank you .
you &apos;re a surgical fellow .
might as well enjoy the perks .
besides , you need to get laid .
you haven &apos;t banged anybody since lexie .
sorry , mer .
i @-@ i have ...
banged people .
i &apos;m screwed .
as long as medusa &apos;s my attending ,
i will never get to see the inside of an o.r.
unless you &apos;re the patient .
don &apos;t be alarmed , but medusa &apos;s walking over here .
depending on her mood , i may have to pretend i don &apos;t know you .
good afternoon , everyone .
as you all probably already know , we have a tradition here .
the honor of performing your first surgery
is reserved for the intern who shows the most promise .
dr. wilson .
congratulations , you &apos;re scrubbing in .
you got soda coming out your nose .
he has an unstable fracture .
i need to do a fuse in here and he--
any numbness or tingling around the median nerve ?
not-- i &apos;m good to go , torres .
you did a great job .
and you &apos;ll need your i.d. card
to access the scan rooms .
hey .
hey .
hi . uh , this is mel barnett .
he &apos;ll be joining us from miami .
peds surgery . i &apos;m the new attending .
and you are ?
i &apos;m derek shepherd , uh , neuro .
nice to meet you .
nice meeting you .
callie torres , ortho .
oh , right .
uh , i am so sorry ,
uh , about your wife .
i mean , i heard , and , uh--
thank you .
okay , uh ...
how about i show you the nicu ?
let &apos;s not make a big deal .
listen ...
i wish i could put them off so you and i could
spend more time together ,
but i already postponed hopkins once .
oh , my god .
just go--get out . get out .
i &apos;m sorry .
callie ?
i said get out .
are you okay ?
get out , okay ? get out .
you &apos;re gonna thank me for this , avery ,
when you &apos;ve rewatched it for the 500th time
trying to figure out how to line up your vertical mattress sutures
as perfectly as i can .
now pan up to my face .
you see that ? not a drop of sweat .
you know why ? &apos; cause i &apos;m that good .
now go get scrubbed . you &apos;re gonna finish up here .
wait . really ?
hurry . before i change my mind .
and i finished the reconstruction we talked about
on the young mastectomy patient ,
uh , and the result is full sloan .
i mean , she is gonna look a scale hotter than god intended .
uh , and grandpa &apos;s labs came back .
stable . um , scarring is gonna be a problem , obviously .
but the result is pretty good considering .
and you think we can do better .
i don &apos;t know . reconstruction ?
that &apos;s pretty radical for a guy his age .
no , you &apos;re right .
we can do better .
hey , i wish you could see the surgery i &apos;m watching .
it is a train wreck .
so you &apos;re not gonna make it by 5 : 00 .
do you want to facetime or skype or something ?
it &apos;s kind of weird that you &apos;re not gonna be here .
oh , look at that .
he turned a port @-@ cabg into a sternotomy .
why ?
why ? because this surgeon is 103 .
because everyone in this frozen tundra
is too damn polite to say ,
&quot; hey , retire , old man ,
before you kill someone with your brittle , bony hands . &quot;
i &apos;m sorry . would you mind taking that outside ?
i &apos;m trying to take notes .
yeah , well , there &apos;s nothing to learn here .
he &apos;s just poking holes
in a guy &apos;s pericardium .
he &apos;ll never come off bypass .
i just wish you were gonna be here .
owen e @-@ mailed me today ,
wanted to make sure i had people around me tonight .
i don &apos;t know why everyone is so worked up about 5 : 00 .
i mean , mark is still gonna be gorked no matter when my plane lands .
oh , for piss sake .
he &apos;s doing another graft .
talk about lipstick on a pig .
hey , whoever that is better have something important for me ...
&apos;cause i &apos;m a busy woman .
i &apos;m sorry , dr. bailey .
it &apos;s your intern-- shane ross .
you left me with mrs. coggins ,
and her c.t. scans just came back--
slide it under the door .
oh , shoot . he did . hold on . hold on .
yeah , uh , yeah , she has a small ... hematoma .
um , just monitor it closely .
only you can make a small hematoma sound sexy .
crazy . ahh .
did you hear that ?
i didn &apos;t hear anything .
b.c.b. &apos; s at it again .
wait . hold on . hold on .
be right back .
alex karev . right .
uh , hunt mentioned that robbins really liked you .
mel barnett . here from miami .
oh , the new peds guy .
you &apos;re headed to ?
uh , hopkins , fellowship . leaving tonight .
that &apos;s right .
great program .
so is this , by the way . hunt &apos;s been filling me in .
oh , did he , uh , tell you about our exchange program yet ?
we brought over 32 kids from 5 different countries in africa .
hunt did mention the program , dr. karev .
admirable work , but i &apos;m afraid it doesn &apos;t fit with my agenda .
we operate on sick orphans .
how does that not fit your agenda ?
not to worry .
i &apos;ve already reached out to u.c.l.a.
the program will continue , just ...
not here .
if you &apos;ll excuse me , i &apos;m trying to close on a house .
welcome back .
torres .
i had nothing to do with this .
okay . i had a little to do with this .
well , thank you , everyone . thank you very much .
it &apos;s really no big deal .
what ?
you have to say it .
it &apos;s a beautiful day to save lives .
there &apos;s no way she pulls this off .
she might , as long as she doesn &apos;t look up at
medusa during the surgery .
yeah , that face will calcify her .
do you think medusa &apos;s always been medusa ?
probably . i heard her mom was even worse .
yeah , but ...
that doesn &apos;t give her an excuse
to act like a demon from the depths of hell itself .
it &apos;s like she can hear us .
yeah , that little red light ...
means the intercom is on .
now sit up straight .
i don &apos;t think that you &apos;re a demon .
focus on what you &apos;re doing .
there it is .
look at that .
god , i needed this .
it feels so good to finally have my hands
on a problem i can fix .
hey , thanks for ...
nelson is on standby . let &apos;s have him come finish .
derek , just take a second . just--
i &apos;ll meet you in post @-@ op .
i had a patient once
who told me about his wedding day
and how they asked all the married couples
to come to the dance floor to dance together .
and then they asked the couples
who &apos;d been only married a year to sit down .
and then five years , then ten years ,
20 , and so on ,
until they got to the last two couples .
two sets of grandparents .
been together 60 years .
60 years with the love of their life .
that &apos;s gonna be you two
at our granddaughter &apos;s wedding .
callie ...
arizona ...
congratulations . i love you .
what about you ?
won &apos;t you be dancing at your granddaughter &apos;s wedding ?
gotta have a partner for that .
well , if you had a partner , who would it be ?
oh , well , that &apos;s easy .
lexie grey .
dr. torres .
uh , not a good time .
hey , look , the new guy , uh , barnett ,
he &apos;s shipping the--the orphan program over to u.c.l.a.
yeah , really not a good time .
i &apos;m leaving , so i &apos;m not gonna be able to do anything about it ,
and i know--i know dr. robbins wouldn &apos;t want this happen .
oh , alex .
maybe you could just talk--
no , what ? what ? what ? just what ?
i &apos;m up to my eyeballs trying to save things around here ,
and your peds program
really doesn &apos;t mean that much to me , okay ?
sometimes things die , alex ,
and there &apos;s nothing you can do about it .
told you , not a good time .
appendix is out .
you &apos;re not finished .
i know . next i ...
pull up on the purse strings
and invert the stump into the cecum .
oh , no .
okay , you ripped the cecum wide open .
what &apos;s next ?
wilson , you have to think , quickly .
come on . what &apos;s next ?
think .
go in and grab your purse strings .
b.p. is dropping .
your patient is in trouble . go .
okay , move . clamp .
irrigation .
irrigation .
suction over here .
i know why you favor a less @-@ invasive approach .
but , you know , you &apos;re a creature of your generation .
i mean , you believe in 30 @-@ second rice
and instant oatmeal
and the--the , uh , news brief .
well , no .
you &apos;re--you &apos;re looking for the--for the bullet ,
the memo , the text .
okay . um , but--
lol . omg . ha !
okay , well , as i said ,
i will open him up , but he &apos;s a baby ,
so there &apos;s only room for one headlight .
so you understand ? one headlight , one surgeon .
of course i understand .
and you owe me one ,
because i &apos;m giving those fingers a good ...
three hours off .
oh , wait , wait . oh , that &apos;s not what i meant .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry . just stop .
this is my case .
you want me to ditch my original plan , fine .
you want to backseat drive , also fine .
you &apos;re the attending . i &apos;m the fellow .
i &apos;ll respect that .
but you &apos;re not stealing my surgery .
you &apos;re welcome to assist , to observe ,
to yammer about the good old days ,
but this is not one of them .
this is my patient , my procedure .
headlight . now .
yes , doctor .
we--we shouldn &apos;t have tried the surgery today , okay ?
it was too much .
being in the o.r. , thinking about mark ...
torres
no , look , i shouldn &apos;t have been operating either .
look at us . we &apos;re emotional . it was just ...
my hand went numb in there .
it &apos;s almost 5 : 00 .
so i discharged our cleft baby .
he &apos;ll be back in about six months .
oh , and i ...
i decided against reconstruction ... for grandpa .
i know it &apos;s not what we talked about , but ...
and don &apos;t take it the wrong way , all right ?
because ...
you &apos;ve taught me a lot .
but i think , um ...
i really know what i &apos;m doing now .
so ...
i &apos;m good .
the plastics posse &apos;s ... gonna live on ...
because , uh ...
because i can take it from here .
after i stop his medication , i &apos;m gonna extubate him .
okay , we &apos;re all doctors here . you don &apos;t need to say this .
i &apos;m not saying it because you need to know the procedure .
i say it because even if you think you &apos;re prepared
for what &apos;s about to happen ,
you &apos;re not .
your brain can &apos;t fully absorb what we &apos;re about to do .
but by saying this ...
i &apos;m giving you a little time to catch up .
so ...
after i stop his medications ...
i &apos;m gonna extubate him .
as indicated in his living will ,
dr. sloan asked that , if life @-@ sustaining procedures
would only prolong the moment of death ,
that these procedures be discontinued .
somewhere to be , dr. yang ?
no . it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s 5 : 00 in seattle .
and 4 : 00 a.m. in moscow ...
and 8 : 00 a.m. in singapore .
clamp .
dr. sloan asked that if he were unable to make
his own medical decisions ,
that his directive be honored by his chosen proxy .
his final request was that only comfort care
be given to him in his final moments .
once support is removed ,
he may only hold on for a few minutes ...
or the process could take hours .
i &apos;m turning the ventilator off .
we &apos;ve sedated him with morphine
so he &apos;s not feeling any of this .
thanks .
i &apos;ll give you some privacy .
we tried so hard ...
out there in the woods .
we thought if we could just get him back here alive ...
i @-@ i can &apos;t stay here .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m--tell derek that i was here and i had to go .
i am , uh ...
i &apos;m going to the airport . i &apos;m gonna go see cristina .
okay .
what &apos;s wrong ?
chief , sorry .
i was just going somewhere else , actually .
that surgery was designed for you to fail .
the intern appy--
it sets you as the example .
okay ?
don &apos;t let it get to you .
why is she so mean ?
she &apos;s just trying to teach you .
no , why is she so mean ?
is it that plane crash ?
what ?
i heard she was in a plane crash
with some other doctors .
they were stranded in the woods for , like , a week .
people died or almost died or something .
yeah , yeah , people died or almost died or ...
something .
dr. grey isn &apos;t mean . she is strong .
and she &apos;s not gonna go easy on you because she knows that
that would be a disservice to you .
you are a surgeon .
it is your job to fix things other people can &apos;t .
now if you can &apos;t handle that , leave now .
if not ,
don &apos;t stand around in hallways and cry .
cry somewhere else ,
where i won &apos;t see you .
yeah , come on in .
dr. cristina yang
of seattle fame , formerly of california .
sit .
how &apos;d it go with dr. thomas ?
uh , well , i &apos;m happy to , uh ,
take one for the team ,
but i &apos;d appreciate if you steered him
in somebody else &apos;s direction .
i &apos;m not sure that &apos;s gonna work .
see , i &apos;ve asked him to help you out ,
navigating the waters and all .
i found the cafeteria .
yeah , it &apos;s ... more than that .
my work has been impeccable .
my record here is perfect .
if all you look at is outcomes , maybe .
but on our yardstick ,
you don &apos;t seem to be thriving .
i want you to succeed .
but the fact is , we work as a team here .
no one here is a superstar .
our hospital is the superstar .
and our patients ...
they &apos;re superstars .
we pride ourselves on that .
no ego , no proprietary attitudes ,
no competition .
are you serious ?
we &apos;re sensitive to all you &apos;ve been through .
if you want to talk to someone ,
i &apos;m happy to give you names .
dr. parker , that won &apos;t--
look , why don &apos;t you take a few days ...
see the lakes ,
check out the mall of america ?
you know , everybody says
they ride the roller coaster for their kids ,
but the adults eat it up .
go get some r &amp; r.
have a good time .
soften up those sharp seattle edges .
doctor &apos;s orders .
i &apos;m sorry . is this r &amp; r a suggestion or--
it &apos;s mandatory , yang ,
starting now .
anything ?
no , not yet .
here you go , doctor .
thank you .
d @-@ does my nickname command respect ?
no .
strike fear in the hearts of residents ?
no .
well , what is it ?
you &apos;ve been ... happy .
and the interns noticed that your happiness
often coincides
with the arrival of-- of dr. warren .
and that &apos;s all i &apos;m saying .
oh , oh , come on now . you have to tell me .
no , i can &apos;t . i am a gentleman .
and also , i don &apos;t wanna .
oh , come on ...
okay , i &apos;m gonna tell you this because i &apos;m literally
about to walk out of this hospital forever .
mnh @-@ mnh . karev . karev .
your nickname &apos;s b.c.b.
b.c.b. ?
booty call bailey .
that &apos;s what they call you .
thank you .
good @-@ bye , dr. bailey .
yeah . bye , karev .
hey . so that &apos;s it ?
i &apos;m not even as good as one of your intern girls , huh ?
you &apos;re not gonna say good @-@ bye to me ?
mer , what--what are you doing here ?
don &apos;t change the subject .
don &apos;t make this a thing .
don &apos;t make this a thing ?
mark is dying right now .
and that &apos;s it ? you &apos;re just gonna leave , too ?
i &apos;m just--i &apos;m gonna be on the other side of the country .
it &apos;s , uh , we &apos;ll talk . it &apos;s not like--
that &apos;s what cristina said . it &apos;s not the same .
nothing is the same .

i keep trying to think of ways
i could &apos;ve done things differently ,
and , uh ...
if i &apos;d realized they were missing sooner ,
if i &apos;d told cristina how much i ...
i keep looking for the do @-@ overs ,
and there &apos;s no do @-@ overs .
there &apos;s just the way it is ,
and i can &apos;t fix that ,
except for this , for you .
wh--
i didn &apos;t teach you , not the way that i should have .
i @-@ i should &apos;ve helped you be strong
instead of kicking you when you were down .
i should never have taken your job from you .
you don &apos;t belong out here on a ... a farm .
you belong in seattle ,
saving lives .
now come home .
uh , i can &apos;t keep doing this alone , arizona .
i just can &apos;t .
get up .
get the hell out of bed and snap out of this ...

because she lost a parent last night .
and i lost my best friend .
and i will be damned if i lose you , too .
snap out of this ?
snap out of this ?
how the hell am i supposed to snap out of this
when you cut off my leg ?
you never really stop feeling the loss .

should i go over there ?
no , just give her a second .
well , no , it &apos;s--i &apos;m-- i &apos;m pressing the button .
it &apos;s just-- it &apos;s not doing anything .
maybe it &apos;s broke and--
i &apos;m taking over .
no , no , no . oh , no .
i don &apos;t need your help . i don &apos;t need--
we have a kid together , robbins .
so you &apos;re stuck with me and my help .
it &apos;s what makes things so bittersweet .
we leave little bits of ourselves behind ...
little reminders ...
a lifetime of memories ,
photos , trinkets ...
i got it .
things to remember us by
even when we &apos;re gone .
