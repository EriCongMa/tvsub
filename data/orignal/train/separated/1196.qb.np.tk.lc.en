i &apos;m sorry , i have to go .
what happened ?
he left me .
someone at a sanitarium you own
paid detective wilden to alter his report .
you could do a lot of damage with that .
could shut the whole place down .
close radley ?
did you miss me ?
you still love him .
whether i do or i don &apos;t ,
i &apos;m just trying to figure things out with jake .
okay , so let me help you .
you like jake . you love ezra .
&quot; a &quot; was here ?
guys ... ali &apos;s book is gone .
gotta you something . you drove all that way , so ...
can &apos;t i just be a nice guy ?
&quot; looks like i &apos;m winning . &quot;
&quot; thanks for the tip . &quot;
the journal . we gave ali to &quot; a. &quot;
&quot; whoever finds her gets to keep her . &quot;
come on .
the tech said the busy bee inn .
can &apos;t this thing go any faster ?
it &apos;s hard to see out here . there &apos;s no lights on this road .
the gps says it &apos;s a mile straight ahead .
if &quot; a &quot; has been at the inn since he sent that text ,
aren &apos;t we gonna be too late to help ali ?
well , we won &apos;t know that until we get there .
that &apos;s if ali &apos;s even there .
we &apos;re going off something she wrote in a journal two years ago .
there it is . turn right .
what the hell happened here ?
looks like there was some kind of struggle .
i could definitely see ali wearing this .
if ali was here , where did she go ?
maybe she fought &quot; a &quot; off and got away .
yeah , or he took her somewhere else .
or worse .
第四季 第十六集
the worst part is not knowing what happened to her .
it &apos;s like deja vu all over again .
just the thought of her in that room makes my skin crawl .
i don &apos;t think she was staying there . at least not last night .
how could you say that ? you saw the room .
the broken window . the message on the door .
yeah , exactly . everything was a little bit too neat .
so what ? you think &quot; a &quot; orchestrated that all
just to scare us ?
where are you ? i can barely hear you .
the church . my mom wanted me to drop off
a pie for the bake sale .
just call me later , okay ?
okay .
dad .
how did you know i &apos;d be here ?
i didn &apos;t .
i came to see toby .
i thought you said you were staying at hanna &apos;s last night .
i changed my mind .
get dressed . you &apos;re leaving .
sure .
right after you call mom and explain to her
what &apos;s going on between you and mrs. dilaurentis .
or should i ?
jason fell off the wagon .
what ?
jessica and i have been helping him get into rehab .
okay . but why all the secrecy ?
it &apos;s not like this hasn &apos;t happened before .
he was arrested for starting a fight in a bar .
he didn &apos;t want us to tell anyone .
we were respecting his wishes .
and that &apos;s why jessica wanted to wait
to tell him about the divorce .
they told us any upsetting news could cause a relapse . so ...
but why are you working so hard
to keep this a secret from mom ?
spencer , if i never mentioned jessica or jason &apos;s name again ,
it would be too soon for your mother .
see , i &apos;m not lying to her ,
i &apos;m just not sharing everything .
there &apos;s a difference .
hey , spence , i got the hot water working .
put some pants on . we need to talk about radley .
alone .
you look like you &apos;ve seen a ghost .
yeah , hanna had a rough night .
oh , i thought she was doing better .
she &apos;s up and down .
i was hoping we could spend the morning together .
i wish i could , but i &apos;m heading to philly in a moment
to meet a college buddy .
hardy ?
no , no . um , curtis . the lacrosse guy i told you about .
we could do dinner . we could meet at the cabin .
ah , i just don &apos;t think that i should go that far .
in case hanna needs me or something .
等不及今天见你了
jake &apos;s back from his tournament ?
yeah , he got in from harrisburg last night .
morning with me . afternoon with him .
no , it &apos;s not like that .
i &apos;m sorry , it &apos;s none of my business .
and i put you in this position .
so , you take your time and decide--
i &apos;ve made up my mind .
i &apos;m gonna talk to him today .
you are ?
yes .
you &apos;re the one . you always have been .
you &apos;re really giving away all these clothes ?
that &apos;s like half of your wardrobe .
i &apos;m just sick of the same old things .
you bought that dress last month . it looks beautiful on you .
well , if you like it so much , you can have it .
you seemed really upset last night .
do wanna talk about it ?
spence , the last thing i wanna do is discuss
my feelings over a tub of chunky monkey .
okay , that &apos;s your favorite skirt .
no . it was caleb &apos;s favorite .
look , if you need more time to process--
spencer , what is there to process ?
he moved on . so , i &apos;m moving on , too .
hanna ? they &apos;re moving everything
out of the basement while they fix that pipe .
what in the world is happening in here ?
you &apos;ve never seen anyone clean out their closet before ?
not in this house .
look , maybe you shouldn &apos;t be in such a rush
to get rid of all these things .
where you going ?
i need more bags .
hello ?
anyone there ?
shana ? are you following me ?
i have a message for you .
a message ? from who ?
alison .
alison &apos;s dead .
isn &apos;t that what you told spencer at the hospital ?
we both know that &apos;s not true .
she wants you guys to stop looking for her .
it &apos;s too dangerous .
you almost got her killed at the inn last night .
why would i believe anything you have to say ?
you didn &apos;t know alison .
listen , emily ...
i &apos;ve known her since i was three .
i grew up next door to her grandparents in georgia .
if you knew alison , you wouldn &apos;t be friends with jenna .
alison asked me to come to rosewood to help figure out
who tried to kill her . jenna &apos;s on the list .
keep your friends close , and your enemies closer .
if you really are talking to her ...
prove it .
radley &apos;s offering my family a settlement ?
they &apos;re not admitting any negligence on their part ,
but the accident did happen on their premises ,
so they want to give you and your family something for your loss .
well , what happened to us trying to shut down the place ?
i still want to . but after looking into it ,
i just don &apos;t think there &apos;s enough evidence
to substantiate a lawsuit .
we know wilden altered the file .
yes , but he &apos;s dead .
there &apos;s nobody else willing to testify against radley .
look , toby , i know this isn &apos;t what you wanted to hear ,
but at least you finally
know the truth about what happened to your mom .
i spoke with your father .
he &apos;s open to signing the agreement .
but in order to move forward , you need to sign , too .
i know it &apos;s not going to bring your mother back
or change the past ,
but it can help your future .
hey there , beautiful .
oh , my god . what happened ?
it &apos;s nothing .
nothing ?
you got a huge gash above your eye .
well , comes with the territory .
besides , you should &apos;ve seen the other guy .
i missed you .
yeah . i missed you , too .
you know , you should look into getting a new one of these .
well , i &apos;ve had it since i was fifteen .
i practice with it before all my big meets .
kind of a superstitious thing .
brought me good luck again .
i qualified for nationals .
wow . congratulations . that &apos;s amazing .
i &apos;m not really surprised .
thanks .
so you hungry ? you wanna grab something to eat ?
sure .
okay .
actually , no .
you &apos;re not hungry ?
i just-- i need to talk to you about something .
sounds serious .
kinda is .
while you were away , i ...
i was just doing some thinking and--
you &apos;re back with ezra .
aren &apos;t you ?
why do you say that ?
you told me the kid wasn &apos;t his .
you &apos;ve been distant on the phone .
come on , aria . i can handle the truth .
i &apos;m sorry , jake .
i don &apos;t get it . i thought things were going so well between us .
well , they were .
i love spending time with you .
just ...
not as much as with him .
ezra and i have a long history together .
i hope we can still be friends .
i &apos;m gonna need a little time for that .
there &apos;s a gag clause in this .
if you sign this , you &apos;re agreeing to never talk about
what happened to your mother at radley .
not to the police , not the press . no one .
i know .
and if you do ,
you &apos;re going to have to give back all this money
plus a huge penalty .
it doesn &apos;t matter . your dad made it clear
we don &apos;t have a case .
yeah , a little too clear .
what do you mean ?
one minute he wants to shut down radley ,
and the next he wants to shut down you .
my mom fell , spencer .
it was an accident .
how do we know that for sure ?
we still don &apos;t know
why she was up there unsupervised ,
or who this &quot; fragile &quot; patient was with her .
your dad also said that if we went to court ,
stuff about my mom &apos;s past would be dug up .
it could get ugly .
look , toby , i &apos;m not saying that you shouldn &apos;t sign this .
but you have to make sure you
have all the information you need before you do .
i told shana to find out what ali had said to me
when she pulled me out of the barn .
when we were looking for dr. sullivan ?
what did ali say to you ?
uh , that &apos;s something i want to keep just between us .
well , shana &apos;s obviously lying .
i mean , ali never mentioned her name once .
there were a lot of people in ali &apos;s life we didn &apos;t know about .
wait , shana knew paige first ?
so what are we saying , that paige is on ali &apos;s list , too ?
i don &apos;t know . maybe .
even if they were friends ,
why would ali trust shana more than us ?
we were her best friends .
are you forgetting ?
someone &apos;s been tormenting us for years .
making our lives miserable , one text at a time .
i think shana &apos;s who we always thought she was :
one of &quot; a &apos;s &quot; minions .
and if &quot; a &quot; wants us to stop looking for ali ,
then that must mean ali wasn &apos;t hurt last night .
so , &quot; a &quot; wants us to believe shana &apos;s story so we stop looking
for ali and he can find her .
come on , em .
you don &apos;t seriously believe that shana moved all the way up
from georgia so she could hunt down the person who tried
to kill her childhood friend , do you ?
ali could make someone love her enough to do that .
hey .
hi .
i figured you &apos;d want this back .
thank you .
what happened in here ?
oh , a water pipe burst in the basement .
so this is where everything &apos;s kind of living here for now .
this is a nice pool table .
we used to have one like it in my house .
yeah , my dad left it here .
i never really played much , though .
so , i was ... i was gonna call you today .
check in , see how you &apos;re doing .
oh , i &apos;m good . yeah , i &apos;m really good .
um , do you have to be somewhere ?
or can you stick around to play a game or two ?
yeah . sure , why not ?
do you wanna rack them or should i ?
you got it .
ali said she missed you the most .
you were her favorite .
nobody loved her as much as you .
she gave you a choice . to stay or to go with her .
before she left , she kissed you .
where is she ? where is ali ?
i never know .
she &apos;s always on the move . she finds me .
how long have you known that she &apos;s alive ?
since mona went to radley .
you &apos;ve known this whole time ?
why did she ... she come to you ?
she wants to meet you , emily . tonight .
but you have to go alone .
that &apos;s the only way it &apos;ll be safe .
why me ?
i guess you really were her favorite .
that &apos;s not the ball you wanna try and sink .
you &apos;re stripes , remember ?
well , i was just giving you a head start .
i &apos;m surprised you &apos;re in such a good mood .
i was worried about you last night .
no , i just had to get it out of my system .
you know you don &apos;t have to put up a front with me .
are you gonna let me hit my stripes or not ?
god , what am i doing wrong ?
here . let me show you .
first of all , you &apos;re holding your stick way too low .
once you get the angle that you want ...
you just , um ,
you just take the shot .
wow . see ? not bad .
watch out , travis . i &apos;m coming for you .
shana knew the conversation we had outside the barn .
word for word .
well , &quot; a &quot; has a way of
knowing things that seem impossible to know .
i looked into it and her story checks out .
shana did grow up next door to ali &apos;s grandparents .
that doesn &apos;t mean she &apos;s in contact with her now .
look , i took pictures of some of the stories
in ali &apos;s journal before &quot; a &quot; got it .
and there are descriptions
of other places that she could be hiding .
we can keep looking .
ali wants to meet me tonight .
like she wanted to meet you at the kissing rock yesterday ?
she needs our help , spence .
did shana tell you this ?
look , even if this were true ,
why would ali only want to meet with you ?
i don &apos;t know .
maybe &quot; a &quot; can &apos;t watch all of us all the time .
look , i know you wanna
believe that this is alison reaching out to you ,
but it &apos;s not ali , okay ? this is &quot; a. &quot;
i don &apos;t think so . not this time .
just because shana knows
about this one conversation you and ali had ?
yes .
well , you &apos;re not going alone .
that &apos;s the only way she &apos;ll meet me .
spencer , i told you because i didn &apos;t want to lie to you .
okay ? don &apos;t make me sorry that i did .
somebody &apos;s getting the royal treatment .
well , your mom will be home soon .
i wanted to do something special for her .
i would have just gone for jewelry instead of roasted duck .
but that &apos;s just me .
i &apos;m hoping you &apos;ll join us .
i think we all could use a nice family night together .
toby told me about the settlement , dad .
yeah , it &apos;s a decent amount of money .
it &apos;s not money that he &apos;s after .
a couple of days ago
he was ready to settle for a letter of apology .
mushroom puff ?
no , thanks . i try to stay away from fungus .
it &apos;s not like you to back away from a case this quickly .
i just did what &apos;s best for toby &apos;s family .
did you ?
why don &apos;t you let me deal with my clients ,
and you worry just about yourself .
now make yourself useful while i &apos;m showering
and pick out some music for dinner .
and please , make it something happy , upbeat .
i don &apos;t like it , but i don &apos;t understand
how you can make such a colossal mistake .
do you understand ?
do you see how this is-- this is difficult ?
no , look at me ! look at me when i &apos;m talking to you .
this doesn &apos;t make sense .
you have really screwed up .
you have really screwed up !
oh , yes , please ! please drive away !
this isn &apos;t over !
five in a row .
wow , you &apos;re really kicking my ass .
well , it &apos;s easy to win when someone lets you .
all right , it &apos;s getting late .
i should probably take off .
yeah . well , this was fun .
we should do it again soon .
rematch anytime .
sorry . sorry , that was so stupid .
of course you &apos;re not into me like that .
no , look ... it &apos;s not that .
then what ?
you &apos;re just getting out of a relationship .
no , i &apos;m not just getting out .
i &apos;m completely out . it &apos;s done .
maybe we should give this a little more time .
mom . i thought you were going out after work with ted .
he had to cancel . hello , travis .
hi , mrs. marin .
can i speak to you for a second , please ?
what ?
i thought you and travis were just friends .
we are .
you kiss all your friends like that ?
don &apos;t judge me .
i &apos;m not judging , i &apos;m concerned .
uh , sorry to interrupt ... but i really should get going .
good idea .
no , travis , stay here .
i &apos;ll call you tomorrow .
travis , you have a little ...
yeah .
okay , are you serious ? you basically just kicked him out .
you will thank me later .
trust me , throwing yourself at a new guy
is not the way to get over the old one .
you &apos;re one to throw stones .
okay . i know that you &apos;re hurting right now ,
but if you could take a step back ,
you &apos;d see i &apos;m just trying to help--
i &apos;m sick of everyone telling me what they think i should
and shouldn &apos;t do to get over caleb .
it &apos;s my broken heart !
what the hell are you doing ?
jessica dilaurentis is on the board at radley ?
is this why you &apos;re pushing toby to sign this agreement ?
jessica being on the board
has nothing to do with the facts of the case .
did she tell you that toby &apos;s mother &apos;s death was an accident ?
or was that your brilliant idea ?
spencer ...
i &apos;m going to the airport to pick up your mom .
if you &apos;re gonna continue to act like this ,
i suggest you find another place to eat dinner .
is jason even in rehab ?
or did you make that up , too ?
toby , listen .
whatever you do , do not sign that agreement .
okay ? i &apos;ll explain it to you later . just don &apos;t .
put your coat on . we &apos;re going out .
it was so thoughtful of you .
keep it .
i can &apos;t do that .
what am i gonna do with it ?
i don &apos;t have another aria in my life .
okay , well ...
thank you .
all right , i &apos;ll let you get back to your jump roping .
you know , i do care about you .
which is why it &apos;s hard for me to understand
why you wanna be with a guy like ezra .
what do you mean by that ?
nothing .
no , you were just about to tell me something . what ?
jake ?
i saw him totally go off on a woman outside the grille today .
what woman ?
some blonde . he was screaming at her
and pounding on her car .
that couldn &apos;t have been ezra .
he &apos;s been in philly all day .
you sure about that ?
i always wondered if ezra was the person you were afraid of .
i &apos;m not afraid of ezra .
well , maybe you should be .
look ...
the ezra i know doesn &apos;t have a mean bone in his body .
you do know him best .
just do yourself a favor : keep your eyes open .
when your dad left me for isabelle ,
i was devastated . and furious .
i was lashing out at all the wrong people .
and a friend of mine suggested that i come here .
to throw plates against a wall ?
you &apos;d be surprised how good it feels .
&apos;kay ? come on .
give it a try .
i don &apos;t see how this will change the fact that caleb &apos;s gone .
it won &apos;t .
but it might help you get past the anger .
and once you do , i promise
you &apos;ll start to look at things differently .
okay ?
what do you have to lose ?
see ?
i wish i could come home to this every night .
so you have fun with curtis ?
yeah , it was great catching up with him .
you know , i &apos;m starving . do you want like pizza or something ?
yeah , pizza sounds good .
great .
did you come in on the last train ?
yeah , i just made it .
uh , i &apos;m gonna wash up .
jake saw you today .
saw me where ?
outside the grille .
said that you were talking to some woman .
actually , he used the word screaming .
did you even go to philadelphia ?
no .
who &apos;s the woman , ezra ?
maggie &apos;s lawyer .
maggie &apos;s lawyer ?
why were you meeting with her ?
maggie is trying to prevent me from seeing malcolm .
i didn &apos;t know that you wanted that .
just because he &apos;s not my son ,
doesn &apos;t mean i don &apos;t care about him .
so , that &apos;s what you were doing all day ?
you were meeting with her lawyer ?
her lawyer . my lawyer .
the whole thing is very complicated .
but why would you keep that from me ?
because having them in my life destroyed us once .
and we &apos;re just getting our footing back .
i didn &apos;t want to take the chance that that would upset you .
okay , that doesn &apos;t explain your violent outburst .
i mean , jake said that you really scared this woman .
the conversation was heated .
voices were raised .
there was nothing violent about it .
so , either jake misinterpreted what he saw ,
or he &apos;s trying to make me look bad
so you &apos;ll rethink your decision .
ezra , i really want this to work .
but it &apos;s only going to if we &apos;re honest with each other .
i made a mistake .
i really am sorry .
look , i chose you knowing all that comes with it .
it &apos;s a choice i &apos;m really happy that i made .
you &apos;re not coming in ?
it &apos;s really you .
yeah , i &apos;ve missed you so much .
you have no idea how hard it &apos;s been to stay away .
then don &apos;t anymore .
let me help you .
we can go to the police . or your parents .
i wish i could . i just don &apos;t know who i can trust .
you can trust me . spencer , aria--
i know i can trust you , em .
i &apos;m just not sure about them .
why ?
you never stopped caring about me , did you ?
even after everything i put you through .
you don &apos;t know how much i regret hurting you .
if i could do it all over again , things would be so different .
who &apos;s doing this to you ? tell me who you &apos;re hiding from .
i thought i knew . but i was wrong .
that &apos;s why i need you , em .
help me find &quot; a &quot; so i can come home .
so that &apos;s who you think tried to kill you ?
what was that ?
who &apos;s out there ?
did you tell anyone about this ?
ali , wait !
ali ! please ! open up , ali !
ali , open up , please !
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry .
please ali , i just want to talk .
i don &apos;t understand . how could she just disappear like that ?
she didn &apos;t disappear . you scared her away .
i can &apos;t believe you followed me here .
i thought you were putting yourself in danger .
yeah , well , you thought wrong .
i know . i &apos;m sorry .
you &apos;re gonna have to work harder than that .
i betrayed alison .
she &apos;s never gonna reach out to me again .
she &apos;s still playing games with us .
what are you talking about ?
ali sucked you back in .
she knew you were pulling away and that &apos;s why she picked you .
she wanted to make you feel special
so that you wouldn &apos;t give up on her .
that &apos;s sick .
no . it &apos;s brilliant .
it wasn &apos;t like that , okay ? she was different tonight .
she was sincere .
she can trust you ,
but she &apos;s not sure about the rest of us ?
don &apos;t you get it ? she &apos;s trying to divide us .
she wouldn &apos;t do that .
wouldn &apos;t she ?
wait . you were listening ? this whole time ?
we can &apos;t let her come between us .
i &apos;d say you &apos;re doing a great job of that all on your own .
i &apos;m sorry .
don &apos;t !
wow . the greeks really know how to live .
you wanna throw another stack ?
are you kidding me ? i &apos;m just getting warmed up .
all right .
hey , mom ?
thanks .
you &apos;re welcome .
where have you been ?
um , just with emily .
i got your message .
yeah , so jessica dilaurentis is on the board at radley .
and that must be why my dad changed--
i signed the agreement .
what ? wait when ?
before i got your message . it doesn &apos;t matter .
of course it does . my dad manipulated you into signing it .
that may be true , but my dad and i had a long talk today
and we decided to move on from this .
it &apos;s the best thing for our family .
toby , you can &apos;t do that .
there &apos;s clearly so much more
to this cover @-@ up than we know .
what i know ...
is my mother didn &apos;t kill herself .
now whether she fell or some disturbed patient
pushed her doesn &apos;t matter .
it doesn &apos;t matter ?
how can it not matter ? don &apos;t you want to know
who that disturbed patient is ?
stop .
let it go , spencer . it &apos;s over .
hey . it &apos;s me , hanna .
i keep replaying the past few weeks
over and over again in my head .
trying to pinpoint the exact moment i lost you .
wondering if i could &apos;ve done something differently .
but , i just wanted to let you know that ...
it was the best year of my life .
hey , you &apos;re just in time .
that looks amazing .
you have something ...
no . i ...
