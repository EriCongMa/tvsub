Anja!
Maura, please help.
I'm in my brunch clothes.
Can't we just do this after we go to Newbury street?
Look, we have to put my bed together
before you drag me to boutiques.
Come on.
Okay.
"Slide tab 'A' into hole 'B'
at the appropriate size for mattre--"
Why do they got to make directions so complicated?
Okay. They're not complicated.
"Extend arm 'C' to align with bed frame at point 'D.'"
I see what you mean.
And where are Frost and Frankie with my mattress?
Frankie, honey, watch your fingers!
Is your mother here?
Yes.
She's afraid Frankie will get hurt before his big interview.
Well, the rate of musculoskeletal disorders
is highest among movers.
The rate for uniforms getting a slot in homicide
is lowest among mama's boys.
What? Okay, th-- that's not a mattress.
Oh, hey, Jane.
Hi.
Don't distract them!
I think they're plenty distracted already.
Hey there.
Are you guys sure you're okay?
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Thank you so much for letting me mooch off your manpower.
Yeah. Mooch away.
I'll just sleep on the floor.
Jane, you want to come meet your new neighbor?
She's a tattoo artist.
I'm Riley Cooper.
I'm Jane Rizzoli.
Hi. Maura Isles.
Oh, a female koi fish. Beautiful!
They symbolize independence and freedom.
Right.
How cool that you know that.
Yeah. You're so cool, Maura.
Anything else you need us to move?
Oh, let me think. Yes. My mattress.
Hey, Jane.
I'm going to loan Riley those non-stick pans I gave you.
You can't do that.
You don't use them.
Well, why don't you give her the bundt pan, too, ma?
Good idea.
If you won't let me pay you,
at least let me get you some cold beer?
Sounds good to me.
That'd be great. Yeah.
While my mother raids my apartment
and gives everything I have to my new neighbor,
now I got to work on a Saturday.
Damn.
Aw, shoot. You got to go, too?
You make homicide, you can kiss your Saturdays goodbye, too.
Frankie, the mattress?
"So in love wedding chapel."
What a weird place to get married.
Well, not everybody can afford a big church wedding.
So go to the justice of the peace.
I mean, at least they don't have plastic flowers.
Her right carotid was severed by something very sharp.
You know, thank goodness you're here.
How would we have known it was something sharp?
Don't be mean 'cause your mattress is still on top of your car.
You can't get bedbugs from the street, can you?
No, no, that's dumb, right?
Well, new mattresses can have bedbugs
if they've been transported with old ones.
See if you have any, you know,
brown or red stains or any pearly white casings.
Oh, my -- please stop talking.
Bride was Anja Babic, 20,
Foreign exchange student from Dubrovnik.
Groom met her in a coffee house he was managing.
Doo-bu-nik-your-upper-lip to you.
I said Dubrovnik is a beautiful city.
You speak Croatian?
Serbian.
It's an easy language.
No, yeah, I-I think I'm picking it up --
super-duper-vodka-dooby-do.
Groom's alibi is airtight --
he was waiting at the altar.
Well, it seems pretty personal.
I'll say -- slashing her throat on her wedding day.
He gave me his phone.
Says his ex-fiancee has been stalking him.
She left 14 messages last night.
Vick you really think I'm gonna stand by
and let you marry that Euro-slut?!
She's displaying signs of intermittent explosive disorder.
It was supposed to be our perfect day!
That bitch has no right!
Doesn't sound too "intermittent" to me.
Ex-fiancee's name was Vicky Collins.
I'll put a BOLO out on her.
Okay.
I'm calling Frankie.
We could sure use his help.
Are you calling him just to keep him away from Riley?
Uh...no.
Frost! Come on. Let's follow the blood trail.
Gives new meaning to "Bride Wars."
There should be one more layer.
The top tier of the cake is missing.
So the killer took the cake?
Do you see a knife?
No.
Um...but I'm seeing a hell of a lot of blood, though.
Look at the arterial spray -- it hit the ceiling.
Yeah. There's no void in the pattern.
Maybe our killer cut her
and then got out of here before getting blood on himself.
Or herself.
Only a bridesmaid would wear shoes that color.
You talk to any bridesmaids?
Weren't any.
Groom said Anja didn't have any close friends.
There are two sets of clothes in here.
Jeans are different sizes.
Got the victim's purse.
And look at this.
Well, she had at least one friend.
Why did you lie to me, Seth?
There was another woman in that dressing room with Anja.
Who is this?
That's Lea. Uh, it's Anja's younger sister.
How come you never mentioned her before?
I didn't want you to send Lea back to Croatia.
So you were marrying Anja
to get her a green card?
No!
And Lea ran after Anja was murdered?
No!
Maybe Lea ran because she killed Anja.
No! That's not possible.
They were inseparable.
I know that Lea ran
because she was afraid of being deported.
Croatia is a dangerous place
for pretty girls
from poor families.
Looks like Boston was pretty dangerous, too.
Two beautiful sisters chasing the American dream.
Used to be enough to get you a reality show.
Any sign of Lea?
No, but here's how they got into the country --
They were sponsored by a non-profit.
"Samaritan girl"?
That's an odd name for a relief agency.
A samaritan helps someone in distress.
If the girl's getting the help,
why is she the samaritan?
Shouldn't you be doing an autopsy
instead of giving a grammar lesson?
Yeah, well, the coroner's van is stuck in traffic.
Which reminds me of Boris Kerner's work
on empirical spatiotemporal features of traffic congestion.
It's
Gosh, that's interesting,
but we're trying to figure out who killed the bride.
Sorry.
I wonder what Anja and Lea
were running from in Croatia.
"Samaritan girl helps young women
get an education and a new life."
Anja got a new life.
It just wasn't the one she was looking for.
Would you take a look at these
and tell us if you know them?
Sure, yeah.
Yeah, actually, I recognize both these girls.
We brought them in.
Dead and missing? This is terrible.
Has Lea contacted you today?
No, actually, I-I haven't met either one of these girls.
You just said you recognized them.
Well, yes, of course.
I recognize them from their photos.
You see, detectives,
we arranged for them to get their visas,
and then we enroll them in an exchange program.
Now, three months ago, these girls
flew here from Dubrovnik.
We sent a van over to Logan to pick them up.
We couldn't find them.
You're sure they made the flight?
Yeah.
I mean, the airlines confirmed they changed planes in London
and arrived here in Boston.
What do you think happened?
We bring over a lot of young women here, detective,
to make sure they have a chance at the American dream.
Unfortunately, some do use samaritan girl
as a way to skirt immigration.
Frankie's responding to a 911 call
at Seth's coffee house.
We should get over there. Thank you for your time.
No problem.
Oh, come on. You know you want some cake.
It's delicious.
Lemon curd with buttercream frosting.
You two, distract her.
Why don't you distract her?
It's kind of a big knife.
It's the cops.
Did Seth send you?
Does his little Croat slut want her cake back?
Too bad. We're enjoying it.
Vicky, drop the knife.
Or what? You gonna shoot me?
How about you?
You gonna shoot me, too, officer?
Put down the knife,
and let's talk about what's upsetting you.
What's upsetting me?
Keep her talking.
Me?
Uh, yeah.
What's upsetting you?
I'll tell you what's upsetting me --
That Croat euro-whore stole my boyfriend!
Oh, man, that sucks.
Drop the knife, Vicky.
I hate lemon curd!
I was voted "Most likely to succeed" in high school.
You're young. There's still time.
No, I'm not! My life is over!
You can stop talking to her now.
So, there are three sets of prints on this cake knife.
One belongs to the crazy ex-fiance, Vicky,
And the other to Anja, the dead bride.
You said three.
Yeah. The third set are partials.
Korsak's working on 'em now.
Maybe Vicky had an accomplice.
Odd.
There's some kind of substance in the wound.
It's blue.
Well, that can't be the frosting.
That was buttercream.
What kind of cake would you have?
For what?
Your wedding.
Who am I marrying?
I'm going to have a hazelnut almond,
chocolate ganache, and maybe mocha buttercream.
Maura, you don't even have a boyfriend.
Oh, I'm not getting married.
I just think it's fun
to play fantasy wedding, don't you?
If you're 5.
Okay.
The edges of the wound are clean.
So, it's not from this cake knife?
No. I've rarely seen a blade sharp enough to make a cut like this.
What a shame to get married in a polyester blend.
What does your dress look like?
I don't wear dresses.
Oh, come on.
You must have fantasized about your wedding dress
as a little girl.
Yes, once. I had a very high fever.
My gown would be silk charmeuse
With an empire waist and a 20-foot train.
And the ceremony would be in the cliffs of Santorini,
right above a volcano.
What if the volcano erupts?
Oh, I'd check for seismic activity.
Of course.
And I wanted to marry Antonio Benivieni
when I was 12.
Not Antonio!
I hate it when we like the same guy!
He died in the 16th century.
Pioneered the autopsy.
I'd be Maura
Dorthea Isles Benivieni.
Wow. Dorthea? And you laughed at Clementine?
Dorthea?!
I didn't laugh. I smiled. I liked it.
And I -- and I like that name, too,
'cause, you know, it's the name of a famous artist.
Oh, my god. You are so weird.
Okay. You know what? Fine.
If it'll move things along, yes.
I was once in love with Bill Buckner.
And then the ball went through his legs in the world series.
No longer.
Can we finish?
Yes.
Thank you.
Okay.
What is that?
Looks like a copper rivet.
I'll send it to the crime lab to run some tests.
Okay.
Oh, it's Korsak.
Our suspect, Vicky, is upstairs,
and she will only speak to unmarried women.
Well, where do you think you're going?
I'm unmarried.
And Vicky sounds a little unhinged.
You might need my professional opinion
to help break the suspect.
Since when?
Reassure her. Compliment her wedding album.
That's a -- that's a nice wedding album.
It's...not... a...wedding...album!
I'm by myself!
Do you see what that slut did to my life?
Do you?
That was a good idea.
Ask her if she has auditory hallucinations.
Um... You ever hear voices?
You bet I do!
That bitch and her sister
were always talking about me behind my back.
Could be brief reactive psychosis.
It'd help to know the event that precipitated it.
You mean the wedding? That event?
Are you hearing voices, too?
W-- uh...yes.
I have a know-it-all in my ear.
You know that Anja bitch was a liar, too?
Wh-what do you mean?
Well, she said she was a student, but she wasn't.
She said she was a virgin, but she was a raging slut.
Turn the page. You'll see.
Slut, right?
Agree with her so you don't inflame her.
Yeah, she's so...slutty.
She deserved what I did to her.
She feels no empathy for her victim.
I got this part.
You think Anja deserved to have her throat cut?
She's dead?
Oh, my god! That's fantastic!
She suffers from psychotic delusions.
Now Seth and I can get married!
It is my professional opinion
that she be put under psychiatric observation.
Good idea.
Jane!
I'm gonna make you eat something green tonight.
Okay, I'll get extra pickles on my burger.
It's Korsak.
Still no sign of Lea.
Wonder if Vicky scared her out of town.
You showed up to the guy's house?
Is that your neighbor, Riley,
sitting with Frankie?
...A sex doll, right?
What's with the suit?
Your interview with Cavanaugh isn't until Monday.
I thought I'd break it in.
Well, I told him to wear it.
Men in suits turn me on.
It's so cool that you're about to become a homicide detective.
It's not a done deal.
Hey, thanks again for the bundt pan.
Oh, Jane, she made the best chocolate cake.
I'll bring you some.
That's nice of you.
Okay, well, nice bumping into you.
Yeah, you, too.
You know, actually, I got to call it a night.
Aw, that must be so disappointing for you, Riley.
Sorry my brother is so crushingly boring.
I think he's great.
I'll see you soon, Frankie.
Yeah.
I'll see ya.
I'll see ya.
Don't interfere.
I'm not.
Yeah, you are. I really like her.
She feels sneaky to me. I think she's hiding something.
So don't go out with her.
Good night, Maura.
He Leaves. She stays.
Well, doesn't that seem kind of...
Kind of...?
You're judging her because she's sitting by herself in a bar?
No.
Yes.
I got some more info on Anja and Lea.
Vicky was right -- neither of them was going to college.
All right.
Hey, uh, you want to sit and have a beer with us?
Uh, no. Thanks, though. Uh, I'm meeting someone.
See you tomorrow.
Yeah. See ya.
She's hugging him, Maura.
Look at that!
She's kissing him!
Yeah, I can see that.
Okay, she's not sitting by herself
or keeping her hands to herself.
Is it okay to judge now?
If she was a man, would you judge?
Hell, yes.
I need to tell Frankie.
Stay out of it.
And I need to tell Frost.
Stay out of it.
Stay out of what?
Jane's new neighbor is doing Darwinian sex selection.
What? She seemed like such a nice girl,
even though she has those hideous tattoos.
Ma, do you even know what she just said?
Yes, I do.
Riley is picking a mate from a big selection.
It's something you should try.
Oh! A small selection -- Frankie or Frost.
What a slut!
Ma!
Excuse me.
Morning, Lieutenant.
Good morning.
I think my mom likes my boss.
I did see them having sex in the lobby.
What?
That was a joke.
Special Irish breakfast for you --
it's steel-cut oatmeal with fresh peaches.
Thanks, Miss Rizzoli. Looks delicious.
Hey, ma.
Frankie!
You look so professional in a suit.
He's a really hard worker, Lieutenant.
Ma.
And he studied really hard for the detective test.
Ma.
There she goes.
Well, there's only one opening in homicide,
and she's trying to help.
Yeah, well, she keeps putting peach flowers
on the boss's oatmeal,
it's gonna send him over the top.
Frankie, if you're half as good as
your mother's cooking,
you got a good shot, kid.
Do you hear that? I got a shot.
Yeah, as long as your mom keeps feeding Cavanaugh.
Oh, is that suit from the Korsak collection?
Riley liked it.
She said it gave me a young Al Pacino vibe.
Okay. You two are idiots.
She's playing you both.
Yeah, we know. It's all good.
It's "all good" if my new neighbor sleeps with both of you?
Well, many cultures exchange partners
to indulge in forbidden pleasures.
Aw, geez. God.
Neither one of us has hooked up with Riley yet.
I mean, that would be a total violation of the code.
The man code? I've heard of this.
I-it's an unspoken set of rules that men live by.
Thank you, Jane Goodall.
So, what, one of these "Man code" rules
is until Riley does one of you,
you both go out with her?
Oh, that seems reasonable. What's another one?
Well, you can't share an umbrella.
And then if, uh, you've known a guy for more than 24 hours,
his sister is off-limits.
So, Jane and detective Frost can't hook up?
Maura!
Well, there's the grenade rule.
That's a big one. - Yeah.
I don't understand.
A "Grenade" is a hot girl's...
ugly friend.
You got to jump on that grenade, hmm?
If it helps your buddy. Mm.
Helps him how?
Sleep with the hot chick, Maura.
Oh, fun's over, kids.
Korsak's got a hit on the third set
of partial prints on the cake knife.
We got a suspect?
Convicted sex offender delivered the cake.
"Manny 'Chatterbox' Cruz."
The bakery know they were hiring a felon?
Yeah. He works for Everyman Cakes.
It's a parolee work program.
So, maybe he tried to assault her,
she fought him, and he slit her throat.
Damn, mami.
If I had known homicide cops look like you,
I'd get arrested more often, eh?
Knock it off!
I kept him cuffed.
He's known for whipping out his johnson
in mixed company.
Did you whip it out in front of the bride, Chatterbox?
And she wasn't impressed, so you whipped out your knife instead?
Look... yeah, I delivered the cake.
I saw the bride and that bridesmaid girl, too.
But when I left, they were fine.
I think we just put you at the murder scene.
All right, I confess.
You confess? To murder?
Hell, no. To sparking up a blunt.
So, you're getting baked while you're on parole?
Right outside the chapel.
But when I lit up, I heard screaming.
Who was screaming?
The chicks -- in some crazy-ass language, too.
Oh, and I heard some dude, too.
You know, for a minute, I thought my blunt was laced.
Did you see anything?
You gonna help me
with my parole violation if I did?
Maybe.
All right.
I saw some dude dragging that bridesmaid girl to a car.
And you just kept smoking?
I thought she was his old lady
and he was taking her all caveman-style.
Oh, you know what I mean?
What did he look like?
I don't know. Uh, like a dude.
White, black, asian?
What about the car?
It was a car, man. Uh, like a sedan.
No, no, no. Maybe an S.U.V.
No. I don't know.
By that time -- pshew -- I was wasted.
Jane, I don't think Lea's on the run.
I think our killer abducted her.
Yeah. We got to find her.
We put out a statewide bulletin.
There's not a single sighting of Lea.
Who the hell took her?
Can we just do one thing at a time?
Either talk about the case or move this mattress.
I hate my brother!
Oh, well, the good news is
I don't see any cimex lectularius larvae.
Ugh, Maura! You and the bedbugs.
Please stop!
That's Riley.
I'm gonna go ask her to help
because it's her fault that we're moving this mattress.
Yeah, man, I got the cash.
I can do 5k of liquid units.
3 o'clock's cool. Same place.
She just bought 5,000 liquid units.
Well, that seems like an awful lot of tattoo ink.
It's liquid ecstasy.
Oh, my god.
A-arrest her.
I can't arrest her for making a phone call.
Maura, my little brother and my partner
are falling for a drug dealer.
I knew it!
You're in early.
Is that someone involved with the missing girl?
No, this is my new next-door neighbor.
I once had a neighbor who cooked meth in his mud room.
You think she's cute?
I mean, if you like that sort of thing. I --
Well, Frankie and Frost are all over her.
They know she's a drug dealer?
No, but they will when I tell them.
Hey, Frankie.
Come here. We need to talk.
Uh, not now.
Cavanaugh called me in for my interview.
Any advice?
Don't choke.
You'll do great.
You will. Come on.
It's your job to lose, okay?
You look good.
Hey, Rizzoli.
Not you. The original Rizzoli.
In my office, now.
I just got word from the commander of the drug unit
that you ran one of their targets.
One of their targets? Wh-- she's my next-door neighbor.
Oh, y-you're ordered not to talk to her,
not to go anywhere near her, in person, or on the internet.
Okay.
She's, um...dating... some cops.
Cops? Plural?
Yes, sir.
Okay, this shouldn't be too hard.
She's your neighbor.
So the two guys I can think of is Frost and Frankie, hmm?
Yes, sir.
I mean, we -- we should warn them.
I mean, maybe she's trying to get close to them
to get information.
Look, I don't even know what the drug unit's got goin' on.
All's I know is that the commander went ape-shit
when you ran that name.
Sir, that's my brother and my partner.
Enough!
You are ordered to keep your mouth shut
until they make their move.
We clear?
Yes, sir.
Good.
Now get back to work.
We got a dead bride and a missing sister.
Yes, sir.
Of course my partner and my little brother
have to fall for the big drug dealer.
Couldn't fall for the little drug dealer.
Wh-- stop worrying.
The man code will prevent them from both hooking up with Riley.
That's so soothing, Maura. Thank you.
I got to tell them! What if something happens?
Oh, something will happen if you don't keep your mouth shut --
you'll be brought up on charges,
and Frankie's gonna lose his shot at homicide,
and Frost will get transferred.
Okay, well, other than that, what could happen?
You see this copper rivet that
we found on Anja's wedding gown?
Yeah. So?
So it has traces of a wheat
containing the Sr6 gene.
Oh, the Sr6 gene. bummer.
Do you ever read
the journal of agriculture and food chemistry?
Every issue.
I especially loved the "Caption the cartoon" contest.
There's a caption contest?
So, the Sr6 was a gene cultivated in the 1940s.
If you're trying to bore me to death, it's working.
It became an vogue for farmers to use copper tools
after a European ecologist promoted the idea
that iron defertilized soil.
Wh-- so, you're saying
that Anja was killed by some old farm tool?
Possibly.
This is a srbosjek knife.
It was used for farming in eastern Europe.
So, you're thinking that the Sr6 residue stuff
was on the shop-sheik knife and that's what killed Anja?
The Croatian nazis called it "Cutthroat"
because it made it easy to slit the throat of a victim.
What? Where are you going?
To look at her scalp.
If it's here, it'd be right...
If what's here?
This.
It's a Cyrillic letter.
They branded her. That's a "K."
Well, what's that?
It means "Cutthroat."
You think that "K" stands for "Cutthroat?"
Maybe.
Well, Anja's fiance said that she and her sister
were terrified of being sent back to Croatia.
Well, this tissue is in its last stages of healing.
This is recent.
You mean somebody did that to her here,
in the U.S.?
Excuse me.
Yeah.
I need a speculum.
If she's been branded,
she's almost certainly been raped.
I found substantial scarring on Anja's cervix,
indicative of recent and repeated rape.
Unfortunately, we see this all the time --
Young immigrant women,
they get targeted by human traffickers.
You're looking at 500,000, just in this country.
What do you make of that?
Oh, god.
I haven't seen a mark like that in 10 years.
This looks like "Cutthroat."
Well, that's the serbian nickname for this knife.
It's possible that a knife like this is the murder weapon.
And "Cutthroat" was also a man.
He was a human trafficker
Whose specialty was women from serbia and croatia.
But he was killed two years ago.
So, what about the "K" On her neck?
He used to carve it into the necks of his sex slaves.
May I use your computer?
Y-yeah. Of course.
His real name was Dragomir Lapov.
Now, Lapov used it on the girls who tried to escape.
Slit their throats as a warning to the others.
So, it looks like we have a new cutthroat.
Get a new one every day. It's frustrating as hell.
What will happen to Lea?
My guess?
She was taken 'cause she's a virgin.
If she's still alive, she'll be auctioned off.
How do we find her?
They'll want her to go to the highest bidder.
Means they'll have to advertise.
How? The internet?
The internet, newspapers.
It's almost impossible to find them
unless you know where to look.
I ran five different web-bot programs.
Searched every inch of local, statewide advertising.
Nothing.
Maybe they're taking a page out of the terrorist handbook --
keeping it all low-tech.
I'll look through the personals.
Sounds like you speak from experience.
Don't you remember? That's how we met.
Either of you see Frankie after his interview?
No.
Crap.
That means it didn't go very well.
"Yugo best mechanics."
I had a yugo.
What do you call a yugo with 1,000 miles?
An overachiever.
Okay, okay, it's a lousy car.
No-nobody drives them anymore.
How do these mechanics stay in business?
I think they're servicing different foreign bodies.
That must be how our killer found Anja.
He was looking for his ad
when he saw her wedding announcement.
A cyrillic "K" -- for "Cutthroat."
Where'd you get the stun gun?
I borrowed it.
Frost, you go first.
Why me?
You have the stun gun.
Now you've got the stun gun.
Gimme that! God.
Where's Lea?
She's not here.
Is your team winning?
Boston homicide.
You so much as blink and one of us will blow your head off.
Go ahead. Shoot me.
You heard the man.
I did.
And I thought eastern europeans were tough guys.
Move in now.
Police! Hands in the air!
Boston Police Department!
Don't move! Freeze! You freeze! Right there!
Turn around.
Joanna, it's okay. It's okay.
These are Cutthroat's girls.
Ask her if she recognizes this knife.
She says this is the same kind of knife
Cutthroat used on her neck.
Does she know these two girls?
She says they escaped.
Tell her that we're gonna show her all the men.
We need to know if one of them is cutthroat.
No.
So, where is he, and what has he done with lea?
You're gonna get fat.
Good.
Can I get you some chocolate milk?
Yeah.
Riley hates fat guys,
Especially ones that drink chocolate milk.
Shut up.
I blew my interview, okay?
What did Cavanaugh say?
He said it's down to me and one other candidate.
All right! So, come on.
You're still in the hunt. Frankie.
Hey, get your own.
What? We're making sure you don't get fat.
Wh-- ooh! There's Cavanaugh.
Let's ask him.
If you do, I will take this plate
and stuff it down your throat.
Hey, boss!
Hey. The drug unit made a big bust today.
5,000 units of ecstasy.
Wow. Nice haul.
Move 'em up to booking.
Oh, my god.
Now you know why the drug unit commander
didn't want you running his target, Rizzoli.
What the hell?
Riley is a drug dealer?
I don't believe it. I want my pans back.
They're my pans, ma.
So, you think you're ready
to be a homicide detective, Frankie?
Maybe you oughta investigate the girls you date first.
And you, too, Frost.
Now, you should know better.
You knew Riley was a target?
Frankie, I'm so sorry.
Hey, knock it off, Frankie.
We're the ones who blew it, not Jane.
Frankie, come on.
Frost, I'm really sorry.
Frankie -- he's never gonna talk to me again.
The blue residue I found in Anja's throat wound
is methyl isobutyl ketone.
Gee, thank you for the sympathy.
I really appreciate it.
Well, he'll get over it.
Aren't you gonna say, "What's the blue stuff?"
What's the blue stuff?
Dry-erase ink.
Wh-what's that doing in Anja's throat wound?
Well, that's better.
Dry-erase markers produce a fine particulate dust
similar to chalk.
So, what? Are we looking for a teacher?
I mean, who else uses those markers?
It's a great writing instrument
for temporary charts, lists, calendars.
Lists and calendars...
Where're you going?
Uh, I need a photo.
What? Jane.
Ask her if this is Cutthroat.
Okay. You're safe now. He can't hurt you anymore.
It's okay.
Cutthroat is Chris Harris.
He got J-1 visas for Anja and Lea.
They thought they were coming here to be students.
He brings girls here to sell 'em.
So, go get him! Go find Lea.
If we move on him now
and Lea's not with him,
we may never find her.
The girls he brings into the country have no next of kin.
It's classic predator behavior.
He selected vulnerable girls
that no one would miss.
Frost, click on the "upcoming events" icon.
There's a fundraiser
at Samaritan Girl headquarters tonight.
"Black tie to benefit the 'maidens' of the Balkans."
"Maiden" means "Young and unmarried."
It also means "Virgin."
You see the fine print?
"Dinner to be followed by an auction."
Can you magnify the bottom of the page?
It's a Cyrillic letter "K."
So, maybe Lea's still alive.
What's the password?
"Cutthroat."
Go ahead.
Every so often, it pays to be a middle-aged white guy.
I am so driving on the way back.
Evening, sir.
Auction is down the hallway.
Oh, man!
Nice right cross!
Yeah?
Nice right cross!
Thanks.
Gentlemen, we open bids at $50,000.
Do I hear $50,000 for this unspoiled virgin?
$50,000.
$51,000!
That's Lea.
$52,000.
Ah. Do I hear $53,000?
$53,000.
Boston Police!
Nobody move!
Hands in the air!
Move in! Move in!
Harris, let her go.
Come any closer, I'm gonna cut this whore.
You mean the same way you cut her sister, Anja?
Shut up!
Let me go!
Shut up!
Shut your mouth!
It's all right. It's over.
It's okay. It's okay.
He killed my sister!
I know. Shh. It's okay. It's okay.
Come on. Come on. Let's get you out of here.
I got her. I got her.
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.
I don't get too many happy endings on this job,
so thank you.
How many more are out there?
There's too many.
But take a look at those girls, detective.
You just gave them all their lives back.
Are you starting to like Pinot Noir more?
No.
Frost and Frankie drank all the beer.
Hmm. Too bad.
Hey, maybe you'll get a new neighbor
and Frankie and Frost will help you move this mattress
to your bedroom.
That would be really nice
because the traffic is really loud out here.
You did good work today.
Thanks.
At least Anja didn't die in vain, you know?
Lea gets to stay here in Boston and go to college.
I just think it's so disgusting that
they put her in a wedding gown to auction her off.
That's the part that disgusts you?
No. All of it disgusts me.
So, you must've had a wedding fantasy when you were little.
Come on. Every little girl has one.
Okay, it wasn't really a fantasy.
It was -- I had this dumb idea
that I would say my vows
at fenway over home plate in a red sox jersey.
It's not dumb.
It's not exactly elegant,
but at least it's colorful.
And we would have the reception over the pitcher's mound,
and we would serve foot-long hot dogs, and frozen lemonade.
And the guests would throw peanuts at us instead of rice.
Can I come?
Maybe.
Okay.
A red sox jersey?
Okay, you're in my fantasy.
