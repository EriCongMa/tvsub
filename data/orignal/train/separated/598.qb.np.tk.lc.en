第五季第八集
okay , we &apos;ll get an estimate on adding grass to the soccer field .
good meeting .
oh jeff , what time is dinner ?
uh , dinner ?
jeff , you didn &apos;t invite shirley ?
well , it &apos;s tuesday .
shirley always goes to elijah &apos;s karate practice on tuesdays .
it &apos;s okay . part of making sacrifices
for my loved ones is not expecting
my loved ones to make sacrifices .
i can do tomorrow .
i can &apos;t .
i &apos;m free on fridays and mondays ...
we &apos;re not moving it !
when shirley can have dinner , we &apos;ll have another dinner ,
because it &apos;s just dinner .
and there &apos;s no need to manipulate each other .
you know that &apos;s what you do .
you know you &apos;re doing it now with that face .
you don &apos;t like my face ?
hello , save greendale committee .
this is david and bixel .
they &apos;re app designers .
they &apos;d like to beta test
their latest social @-@ networking app on our campus ,
which could be good for us .
look what facebook did for harvard , right ?
hey , guys . bixel and i would like
to introduce you to a little app called meowmeowbeenz .
meowmeowbeenz let &apos;s you say
how much you like , who you like , when you like ,
all from a standard non @-@ boost mobile phone .
let &apos;s see how it works .
bixel , what did you think of the way the dean introduced us ?
i thought he did great .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m giving him five meowmeowbeenz .
well , bixel , i &apos;m sorry ,
but i thought his intro was just okay .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m gonna give him
two out of five meowmeowbeenz .
my meowmeowbeenz .
with meowmeowbeenz , students can rate teachers .
teachers can rate students .
everyone and anyone can rate each other .
meowmeowbeenz .
you know ...
i could ...
i fought for this country ,
and i know you don &apos;t get to pick and choose
the parts you fight for , but i know ...
i should go number two soon .
hurry up ! i &apos;m late for human rights class .
i &apos;m sorry .
why is starburns carrying garrett &apos;s books ?
it &apos;s like toast bossing crackers around .
i mean , i guess .
garrett &apos;s got three meowmeowbeenz .
starburns is a two .
are you telling me people are actually using this stupid app ?
it &apos;s addictively effective .
no , it &apos;s effectively stupid .
there already was a rating system
in place called &quot; cool people get more , &quot;
and it was working fine .
meowmeowbeenz takes everything subjective and unspoken
about human interaction and reduces it
to explicit , objective numbers .
i &apos;ve never felt more alive .
as long as you &apos;re happy , i &apos;m unsettled .
hey , guys .
what happened to you ?
i sat on a toilet so long , my feet fell asleep ,
then i noticed limping was getting meowmeowbeenz ,
so i just kind of started committing .
did you understand a word he said ?
hey , here you go . here you go .
nobody is gonna down @-@ vote a guy on his birthday .
wait . are you using meowmeowbeenz ?
if you can &apos;t kill it , join it .
when you get older , you &apos;re gonna see the warning signs .
mark zuckerberg is fidel castro in flip @-@ flops .
meowmeowbeenz is gonna make east berlin look like woodstock .
you take my word for that .
do you own stock
in trivial pursuit &apos;s baby boom edition ?
britta .
wh ...
please tell me you &apos;re not using this app .
uh , i liked the idea at first , giving a voice to the unheard ,
but then annie just told me
that the rating system is exponentially weighted .
as your ratings go up , your ratings of other people
become more important .
no .
it just means the more others like you ,
the more likeable you can make others .
it makes sense to me .
you know who else it made sense to ?
say &quot; hitler &quot; one more time , and i &apos;m giving you a two .
jeff , are you not registered ?
the longer you wait ,
the harder it &apos;s gonna be to get your number up .
annie ! listen to yourself .
you &apos;re learning its language .
you &apos;re letting a video game play you .
i got to set these people straight .
hey , hey , uh ...
students of greendale !
we don &apos;t have to worship a calculator !
there is no formula for people !
you &apos;re punishing me for being alive !
that &apos;s the general idea , baby .
you &apos;re gonna think i &apos;m joking , but you were getting through
to me more with mustard on your lip .
oh , shut up .
he &apos;s not kidding , britta .
i thought i was imagining it .
when you had mustard on your lip ,
i was more open to your opinion .
maybe it dilutes or distracts from your excessive intensity .
maybe it dilutes or distracts from your stupid butt .
how you doing , rog ?
hey , charlotte . i see what you did there .
vicki , i love this .
shirley &apos;s a five .
how ?
she &apos;s nice to people , jeff .
you know shirley .
oh , vicki , thank you .
did you just give me four meowmeowbeenz ?
i love my four from vicki .
no !
stop it !
i didn &apos;t mean it .
yeah .
i do know shirley .
we should be having brownies .
i &apos;m going to help shirley .
not a bad idea for you , britta . she could make you a two again .
screw your twos , and screw meowmeowbeenz .
i know that &apos;s your one talking .
what are you doing ?
registering for meowmeowbeenz .
i &apos;m gonna become a five and expose this thing
for the sham it is .
oh , now you &apos;re speaking my language .
that &apos;s unintentional , trust me .
just make sure you know the real reason
you &apos;re doing something , or you &apos;ll fail before you start .
that &apos;s actually a good point .
it is ? why ?
oh , come on !
so i &apos;m like , &quot; that &apos;s two cups , &quot; and she &apos;s like , &quot; what ? &quot;
i &apos;m like , &quot; two cups , balls back , tops off . &quot;
all right , trent , mulch , dave ,
herpie , clutch , dirt mouth ,
rope , tingles , cat woman , steve .
all right , keep it floppy .
haul it , ball it , never call it .
girls are objects .
yeah !
two meowmeowbeenz .
congratulations .
abed was just explaining that the fives get to choose
what setting the air conditioning is on .
yep .
is it me , or are more people wearing gray .
i feel like i &apos;m in a commercial ,
and someone &apos;s about to hand me a starburst .
threes and twos tend to wear neutral colors .
looking like you want to move up can get you moved down .
abed , hey .
hi .
come on .
come here .
those are other threes .
we talk about how we &apos;re glad we &apos;re not twos .
small talk , guys .
i make small talk now .
hello , jeffrey .
i see you decided to join meowmeowbeenz .
oh , it &apos;s a great tool for living .
you look great .
you look great .
you know what you &apos;re doing .
you know what you &apos;re doing .
i &apos;m watching you , okay ?
yeah , you &apos;ll be watching my hinder , mama ,
and choking on its billowing plume of highly rated dust .
fours and above only .
these are snacks for the fives .
yeah ? you &apos;re a two .
leonard , would you rather a three serve the fives food ?
no .
it is no secret that the threes and twos
are growing suspicious of the fours and fives .
all i know is that it &apos;s my birthday .
what if we give these people something to believe in again ?
koogler ?
i know what you guys think of me , okay ?
&quot; hey , it &apos;s koogler . &quot;
you know . &quot; he &apos;s cool . &quot;
&quot; he likes to get laid . he &apos;s not that old . &quot;
but i &apos;m a five because i know what the twos and the threes need .
what do we all need ?
entertainment .
a talent show .
an event where threes and twos can rise and fall .
it helps people believe in the system .
give my spot to someone else . i don &apos;t want to be a five .
i was happy as a three . i &apos;m miserable .
oh , dear abed .
so humble .
you people are monsters .
well , if there &apos;s nothing else , then ...
speak .
headline items ... a few twos broke into a supply closet
and stole a box of peanut butter .
the futurization of the campus decor is almost complete .
and a few hours ago , jeff winger became a four .
that &apos;s nice .
you there , girl .
how many meowmeowbeenz ?
two !
two ? are you lost , two ?
yes . are you lost , two ?
i &apos;ll escort her to the common area .
you &apos;re a four ?
i don &apos;t recognize you .
he &apos;s new beenz .
bye @-@ bye , new beenz .
threes and twos must leave building one after 7 : 00 .
building one after 7 : 00 is fours only .
what are you doing here ?
how goes the revolution ?
i can &apos;t break a four .
it &apos;s impossible to get any higher
without half the fives in your corner .
they got this thing locked up .
yeah , but they &apos;re nervous .
they &apos;re hosting a talent show
to prove that anyone can be a five .
if you enter it , you &apos;ll be center stage
with all eyes on you ,
and you can tell everyone this isn &apos;t democracy .
this is tyranny .
i &apos;m sorry . can you put some mustard ...
i shouldn &apos;t have to put mustard on my face
for this to make sense .
you know we have to take this system down .
you know ...
i once loved a two .
matthew ...
he was my everything .
but numbers change .
i &apos;ll keep your secret , new beenz .
it says you &apos;re next .
now , jeffrey , i beg you not to take this risk .
you know what they say .
fives have lives , fours have chores ,
threes have fleas , twos have blues ,
and ones don &apos;t get a rhyme because they &apos;re garbage .
craig , i got this .
no !
no , please !
not the outlands !
please !
boo on you !
the fives have spoken !
and you ... uh ...
are not very good and ...
what ? no ! please !
i &apos;m just not very good at public speaking and ...
last chance , jeffrey .
showtime .
my name is jeff winger .
i recently became a four .
funny thing is , when i was a two ,
i didn &apos;t actually have any less .
but i did have a lot of crazy friends .
hey , my name &apos;s tommy talouca .
i &apos;m from hallway &quot; c. &quot;
i &apos;m a two !
i got to get to the cafeteria before they run out of apples !
what is with twos and apples ?
you &apos;re given three kinds of fruit .
mix it up .
then you become a four .
and you get that , uh ... that four walk .
you know what i &apos;m talking about ? it &apos;s like this .
it &apos;s like one of these .
and they got a little trail of twos behind them ,
and they &apos;re like &quot; hey , is there an apple up there ? &quot;
wow . what else is going on ?
he &apos;s killing it .
there came a time
when i has to a &quot; aks &quot; myself ,
did i even want to be a three ?
or did i just hate myself for being a two ?
i don &apos;t know .
all i know is ...
i sure do love them apples !
oh , the koog &quot; approogs . &quot;
that &apos;s a five !
yeah !
review . review meow meow meow meow meow !
review . review meow meow meow meow meow !
down here , guys .
yeah , yeah .
can i get a picture ?
i want my future kids to know this happened .
i admire your optimism , garrett .
what the hell ?
i don &apos;t want to hear it .
i got this far because i need to take shirley down .
what about everyone else ?
look around you , britta .
everyone wanted this .
fives only , ma &apos;am .
oh , great . come on .
you ... you think this system &apos;s gonna last forever ?
i &apos;m gonna free people &apos;s minds .
i &apos;m a psych major . words are my weapons .
i &apos;m a security guard . weapons are my weapons .
welcome , fives ,
to the inaugural fancy future dance .
i &apos;m glad you don &apos;t think making jeff a five
was a mistake like everybody else .
i believe in taking risks .
yeah ! jeff &apos;s really cool .
couldn &apos;t help but notice that shirley didn &apos;t clap
with the rest of you after my performance .
is she always so different ?
if you talk to me , i can &apos;t concentrate on the dance moves .
you don &apos;t believe the rumors , do you , koogler ,
that jeff manipulated his way to the top ?
shirley , i can hear what you &apos;re saying .
you &apos;re trying to manipulate someone
into thinking i &apos;m manipulative .
no one ever knows what you &apos;re talking about
i &apos;m sure i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
because you never say what you mean .
do you want to have this conversation ,
or do you want to just keep flexing your veiny arms
and throwing out apples ?
tranquility is advancement .
a happy three is a future four .
twos and threes , you &apos;re accepting a life you don &apos;t have to live !
stand up for yourselves !
really ?
ugh , fine .
give me that .
hey !
you &apos;re all alive !
you are all alive !
look at the mustard on my face , but listen to my words .
you &apos;re one of the angriest , most vindictive ...
you &apos;re the angry one ,
because the rules got changed on you , winger .
you can &apos;t just be cool and be in charge now .
no , you have to gossip and give out food
and make people feel guilty .
okay , yeah .
i bust my ass making a world full of selfish idiots
remember my name !
fine .
call it hard work , but don &apos;t tell me the system
measures who &apos;s nice .
actually , it kind of does .
security , banish them to the outlands
with the rest of the ones !
oh , no !
okay , okay , okay .
no ! no !
ladies and gentlemen , please put your tray tables
in their party positions ...
so sayeth captain koogler .
actually , keep the tray tables where they are , koogler .
the rule of the fives is over !
long live the review @-@ lution !
no !
that comes down ?
okay , okay , all right , all right ,
all right , all right !
happy ?
are you happy ?
look , i knew you couldn &apos;t go to that stupid dinner .
that &apos;s why i didn &apos;t invite you .
it &apos;s nice to be invited anyway .
sure , if you &apos;re a control freak .
oh , and you clearly hate control .
no .
i love it .
i guess it &apos;s easy to pretend that you don &apos;t when you got it .
you &apos;d think we &apos;d be better friends
because we &apos;re both such big fans of the same thing .
you there ! ones !
you are permitted back indoors by decree of britta ,
the mother of ones .
and do i hear correctly that as a five ,
you felt you could park in handicap spots ?
well , you see , that &apos;s just part of the koogler style .
it &apos;s human crap style . rate him !
well , that &apos;s low .
all fives must be cleansed of their five filth
and reduced to oneness .
jeff . hey , shirley .
i &apos;m not a five anymore . i &apos;m a one like everyone else .
i &apos;m like everyone else .
who &apos;s next ?
all right , time to pull the plug .
oh , great mother of ones ,
mustard @-@ faced savior ,
there is still a five hiding among us
that has not been cleansed .
nonsense .
all fives were reduced to oneness
in the great purge of about two minutes ago .
this five cheats .
it never registered ,
yet was given a five from outside the system .
behold ...
the meowmeowbeenz app .
its beta test ended days ago .
it &apos;s now available in the app store ... 99 cents .
five stars .
this five lied to us ,
used us , judged us ,
yet exempts itself from judgment .
and i &apos;m pretty sure it &apos;s selling our information to spammers
because i am getting a lot more email ,
and trust me , my penis needs no enlargement .
so how do you cleanse a five that &apos;s unregistered ?
delete it .
by the way , guys , it &apos;s a saturday .
um , you &apos;re all in school for nothing .
go home and get some sleep .
no !
no . wait .
no , don &apos;t go ! where are you going ?
no .
attention , greendale .
i &apos;d like to propose we basically forget everything
that happened over the last few days .
and i don &apos;t anticipate a lot of pushback on that .
i think we &apos;re all pretty embarrassed .
hey , there .
oh , hey .
so i was thinking about checking out this new restaurant tonight .
oh , that &apos;s sweet , but i can &apos;t tonight .
not even takeout ?
we could eat in the study room .
oh , i think i have time for that .
jeffrey .
what ?
i &apos;m not gonna take it off .
i still got two days left on the rental .
every once in a while , a film comes along
that takes a serious look at higher education .
this is not one of them .
gentlemen ...
assume the party .
this summer ...
fun has a new name .
koogler ? koogler !
koogler .
koogler !
koogler !
koogler ! koogler !
hope you don &apos;t mind if i play through .
hammer road pictures invited you to meet the man ...
the myth ...
i &apos;m photocopying my rear end .
the koogler .
koogler .
i guess i have what you might call
an aversion to education .
do you even have a career plan ?
yeah , uh , does getting laid count ?
no !
mitchell d. hurwitz is koogler ...
