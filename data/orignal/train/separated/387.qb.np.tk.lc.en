anyone recognize these faces ?
victims of the footpath killer .
that &apos;s what virginia newspapers are calling him .
we refer to him as the &quot; unknown subject &quot; or &quot; unsub . &quot;
i told virginia p.d. ,
who owns an american @-@ made truck ,
works a menial job .
i told &apos; em when you find him ,
have a n @-@ i-- n @-@ nice day .
the gun .
ta-- take out the gun .
who-- who are y--
who are you ?
who are you ? !
fbi .
t-- t-- t--
take out your w-- your w-- wallet .
wh-- what--
what do you kn--
what do you know ?
about you ?
i know a lot about you .
i know how you do it .
i know you can &apos;t stop .
and i know something that no one &apos;s ever been able to tell you .
i know why you stutter .
i was a lot worried .
but how did you find him ?
i was just stopping for gas .
&quot; there are certain clues at a crime scene which ,
by their very nature ,
do not lend themselves to being collected or examined .
how does one collect love ,
rage , hatred , fear ? &quot;
these are things that we &apos;re trained to look for .
so anyone else would have just seen a guy who stutters ,
but you saw the footpath killer .
right .
because of a parking ticket .
this is true .
this is also a good time to stop .
okay , i &apos;m curious .
why &apos;d he stutter ?
you tell me .
check . checkmate 3 moves .
what ...
you know you &apos;ll beat him when you start learning .
the footpath killer , why did he stutter ?
he wants us to figure it out .
okay . i &apos;m up for a challenge .
good , because these go to you .
highest number of solved cases in seattle 3 years running ,
specialty in sex offender cases .
not bad .
well , i &apos;m the unit liaison .
my specialty is untangling bureaucratic knots .
mostly because i &apos;m never in my office ,
so just call me on my cell , okay ? we &apos;ll talk .
did you watch it ?
yeah . think everybody should see it .
bau team , can you meet me in the conference room , please ?
i need to show you something .
this is from the phoenix office ,
who recorded it ?
a student with a digital camcorder .
he was watching a fire in the building across from their dorm .
the building &apos;s on fire . bro , you getting this ?
is that the kid ?
yeah , that &apos;s him .
dude , over here . check this out . what is it ?
i don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s coming underneath the door .
is someone in the hallway ? hey , someone &apos;s trying to get in .
hey , man , you should get away from there .
oh , my god ! it smells like gas .
oh , god ! god ! oh , my god ! oh , my god !
put me out ! oh , my god ! oh , god ! help !
einstein once said :
&quot; imagination is more important than knowledge .
knowledge is limited .
imagination encircles the world . &quot;
loss of job , loss of love .
when was the first fire set ?
march . uh , the next one was in may ,
and the third one wasn &apos;t till september ,
then 2 weeks later there were 3 in one night .
82 % are white males between 17 and 27 .
sounds like our boy &apos;s a student .
don &apos;t be so sure .
if he went from setting one fire to 3 in 2 weeks &apos; time ...
rapid escalation .
the power over life and death .
who we talking to first ?
dean of students , ellen turner .
&#91; 坦普市 纳利桑那州 &#93;
no badges .
by letting him know he got the fbi here .
try not to look official .
try to look less official .
obviously , i &apos;d rather be meeting you under different circumstances .
this is fire inspector zhang .
this morning the chemistry department reported
several bottles of highly flammable chemicals missing .
i &apos;m prepared to evacuate this campus . thank you .
that brings with it its own problems .
you might evacuate the arsonist as well .
then the case goes unsolved , the campus is reopened ,
but the fires start up again .
hotch , gideon , hold on a second .
you said the chemicals were missing today .
it says here that one of the previous fires
was set with diesel fuel that disappeared from the grounds keeping facility .
how long after it disappeared was the fire set ?
one day .
if he &apos;s holding to a pattern ...
who &apos;s to say the next fire won &apos;t be today ?
door was locked .
but the unsub couldn &apos;t get in .
so he pours the accelerant into the room from the hallway .
which means he couldn &apos;t see the fire .
but he could hear matthew rowland screaming .
but we do know from precedent that
sex and power .
but a serial arsonist wouldn &apos;t just set a fire and walk away .
he needs to experience it .
so why would he set a fire he couldn &apos;t watch ?
he turned the water off just before the fire .
the last 3 were set with these .
2 devices , simultaneous ignition .
there was no device used on matthew rowland .
unsub set that one manually ?
not necessarily .
well , if the target was matthew rowland ,
then why set the other 2 fires ?
the motives for arson are relatively simple .
there &apos;s vandalism , crime concealment , political statement ...
we interviewed matthew rowland &apos;s roommate .
he said matthew was very well @-@ liked .
no . the fires are too sophisticated ,
and if he &apos;s trying to make a political statement ,
he &apos;s not being too clear about it .
there &apos;s an underlying strategy in this case .
matthew , firefighters , injured victims .
they &apos;re objects .
exactly .
all right ... i want to set a dormitory fire .
where would i start ?
in the basement .
the upper levels would be fuel .
then why did i start on the third floor ?
oh , god !
because it wasn &apos;t the building i wanted to set on fire .
the timer sets the road flare ,
yet sophisticated in its simplicity .
could also mean chemistry professor .
mmm , i say student .
full of 30 college kids .
arsonists are socially incompetent .
this guy doesn &apos;t go on dates .
he doesn &apos;t go to parties . he doesn &apos;t feel comfortable in front of groups .
and , of course , he &apos;s a total psychopath .
course .
no .
if you don &apos;t mind my asking ,
why then did you set up the number ?
well , serial arsonists enjoy manipulating authorities .
they like to communicate , explain themselves .
i &apos;m not waiting to hear from a tipster or witness .
because the exits out of the campus block so quickly .
agent gideon ?
agent gideon . agent gideon ?
everybody out of the building ! go !
what is it ?
look out ! clear the whole building ! clear it ! now !
come on ! help me ! help me !
get off of me ! there was a teacher !
let it go ! he &apos;s already dead .
let it go .
he might be here watching .
you got it .
the professor &apos;s name was wallace ?
um ... he knew how to make a difference .
how long will it take to finish evacuating the campus ?
well , there &apos;s another problem with evacuating .
let &apos;s round everybody up .
dean turner ? hi , i &apos;m jeremy .
i &apos;m one of the research assistants at the science department .
we were talking , and , uh , we &apos;d like to help .
the best thing you can do right now is just stay--
we know how he did it .
look at these expressions .
we got fear , a touch of horror ,
even a little bit of panic .
where &apos;s the guy gettin &apos; off ?
&quot; i am devoted to fire . fire is my master . &quot;
okay , so who was our boy &apos;s master ?
10,000 plus students ...
and one has a serious fascination with fire .
fire starting is one third of the homicidal triad ...
an early predictor of adult disassociative criminal behavior .
bedwetting ... and cruelty to animals .
it &apos;s just the standard profile of a serial arsonist .
based on hundreds of interviews .
based on precedent .
we &apos;re off the mark .
because of the 2 missing elements .
and without &apos; em , we do not have a profile .
uh , sorry . i didn &apos;t mean to scare you .
i &apos;m just , um , i &apos;m campus patrol .
i &apos;m supposed to ask for your i.d.
sure , sure .
you &apos;re one of those fbi guys .
like a profiler , right ?
like , one look at a crime scene ,
you can tell what kind of shampoo a killer uses ?
you sound skeptical .
uh , maybe a little .
your girlfriend thinks you &apos;re gonna break up with her .
you &apos;re kidding , right ?
well , you keep adjusting your necklace .
that tells me you &apos;re not used to wearing one
take care of yourself , all right ?
reid . since you &apos;re more their age ,
why don &apos;t you do the talking ?
ahem . hi-- hi , guys . uh , my name &apos;s , uh , dr. spencer reid .
i &apos;m a , uh , agent with the-- the bau ,
the behavioral analysis unit of the fbi ,
which , um , it used to be called the bsu , the behavioral science unit ,
which is also part of this thing called the cirg ,
the critical incident response group , and--
may i , please ? thank you .
see this ? drill a hole in the side ,
fill it with gasoline or whatever &apos;s good and flammable .
turn the light on . boom .
that is what went down , didn &apos;t it ?
the stuff &apos;s all over the net .
potassium , sulfur ...
and normal sugar .
sugar-- sugar , which is--
not exactly plutonium .
you could get this stuff anywhere .
sugar from the supermarket .
but you don &apos;t need to be a chem major to know that .
do you think it &apos;s a chem student ?
you wanna know what i think ?
hold on .
so what are you still doin &apos; here ?
i can &apos;t leave . we got projects .
you know how to solve the 3 body problem ?
do you have any idea how many people called me today
with absolute certainty that our arsonist is a firefighter ?
this came into the hotline about 5 minutes ago .
&quot; karen . i do this for karen . &quot;
the call came from the office right next to wallace &apos;s
5 minutes before the fire was started .
play it again .
&quot; karen . i do this for karen . &quot;
what is it ?
i &apos;m not sure . somethin &apos; about it .
is this tape clean ?
i can put it through some audio filters .
look , we need as close to the real voice as you can get ,
and anything that might be in the background . can you do it ?
ok , you know how on star trek
and mccoy says , &quot; damn it , jim ,
i &apos;m a doctor , not a miracle worker ? &quot;
hey , what are you tellin &apos; me , not to expect a miracle ?
no , i &apos;m saying i &apos;m not a doctor .
that &apos;s my girl .
these are all the women on campus with the first name karen .
a lot of karens . hmm .
no , he &apos;s not done yet .
he &apos;s not goin &apos; anywhere .
keep thinkin &apos; .
you mean , out--outside the box ?
that &apos;s what morgan &apos;s always telling me .
well , he &apos;s probably right .
the standard profile of a serial arsonist .
what you don &apos;t know . the unknown .
sometimes you have to get creative .
even if you think it &apos;s utterly unlikely ,
thank you , karen .
karen number 7 .
how about we just change the first question to
nope . you ?
i know that embarrassment makes a stutter worse ,
and that when you &apos;re flustered ,
it &apos;s more difficult to control the articulatory musculature of the face .
you sound like reid .
you did not just say that .
obviously , somebody &apos;s been doin &apos; their homework .
i still have no idea what causes a stutter .
karen . number 8 .
hey . i didn &apos;t scare you again , did i ?
just lookin &apos; at the board .
the 3 body problem .
you know what it means ?
uh , no . no idea .
it &apos;s physics . it &apos;s one of the great mathematical mysteries .
you broke up with her . no more necklace .
yeah , i kinda wanna date someone else .
oh . well , that &apos;s , uh ...
that &apos;s a pretty good reason .
yeah , other than telling me that homosexuality &apos;s a sin ,
and that i &apos;m going to incur the wrath of god .
the wrath of god .
garcia , what the hell is ka @-@ rown ?
most definitely , sweetness ... with reid .
bye . hey , reid .
garcia says it &apos;s not &quot; karen . &quot;
the motive is now religious ?
and christians worship god as a consuming fire .
okay , so we &apos;re lookin &apos; for a theology major .
maybe he &apos;s punishing the other students for their sins .
i don &apos;t want this .
no , &apos; cause that &apos;s not consistent with the previous targets .
what about the idea of baptism by fire ?
we are running out of time .
compulsion .
this is crazy . hey , mac , get over here .
dude , over here . check this out . what is it ?
i don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s coming underneath the door .
is someone in the hallway ? hey , someone &apos;s trying to get in .
hey , man , you should get away from there .
oh , my god . it smells like gas .
help ! oh , my god ! oh , my god !
hold on , man !
outside the box .
keep thinkin &apos; . it &apos;s like chess .
you gotta see this the building &apos;s on fire .
there &apos;s always fires during rush week .
dude , over here . check this out . what is it ?
dude , over here . check this out . what is it ?
i don &apos;t know .
there &apos;s always fires during rush week .
3 times .
3 professor wallace
&quot; professor wallace . tuesday , 3 : 00 . &quot;
i know why the profiles never fit .
the fires thus far have been completely task oriented .
so once they &apos;re set , the unsub is done ?
obsessive compulsive disorder .
he does everything in 3 &apos;s ,
there &apos;s a form of ocd called scrupulosity .
religious obsession and compulsion .
an obsessive fear of committing sin ,
which creates so much anxiety that he &apos;s compelled
to do something to ease that anxiety .
like setting fires .
all right . remember the night of the 3 fires ?
we saw the doorknob turning against the lock .
well , what about the fires ?
the first ones were single fires .
they were in 3 &apos;s . a trinity of 3 &apos;s .
the first fire occurred on march third .
3 : 00 p.m. , third day , third month .
it &apos;s that convergence of 3 &apos;s that causes the overwhelming anxiety .
obsessive compulsives ease the anxiety by performing the compulsion .
office number 3 .
third day of the week .
matthew rowland was in that class .
it was his third class of the day .
because our minds are incredibly adept at seeking out patterns .
but to the unsub , once that pattern hits ,
bam-- he sets a fire .
but if the target was always people ,
they were failures .
up until matthew rowland .
what is it ?
i think i know who it might be .
and it &apos;s not a he . it &apos;s a she .
clara hayes .
a chemistry student .
i &apos;ll get you her records now .
first get campus security out and find her .
she could set her next fire within hours .
okay , got it . her apartment &apos;s off campus .
but how is he sure it &apos;s this girl ?
when i was talking to her and her classmates ,
i noticed something-- a ring on her finger . and she kept turning it .
and she counted off the ingredients of a light bulb bomb .
potassium , sulfur ,
and normal sugar .
sugar . sugar .
and the word &quot; sugar . &quot;
the 3 body problem .
no one in here .
i &apos;m thinking more like omg .
deuteronomy .
that &apos;s the greek mythological ferryman of the dead .
it &apos;s also the name of pluto &apos;s only moon .
paradise lost .
&quot; moloch , horrid king ,
moloch was the demon sun god of the canaanites .
in order to keep from incurring his wrath ,
16 @-@ year @-@ old survives inferno .
the mother ellen hayes called it a miracle .
&quot; my daughter was tested by god .
look at the house number .
333 .
hey , morgan ,
you know what magical thinking is ?
obsessive thoughts .
it &apos;s like a superstition . it controls them .
except she actually believes it .
god tested her with fire ,
and now when three 3 &apos;s--
three 3 &apos;s show up around another person ...
god tells her to test them .
security &apos;s checking the science building .
well , where else would she be ?
we need to find the next pattern of 3 &apos;s .
hey , hotch ... we &apos;re lookin &apos; , man .
i don &apos;t think she would have left behind a day planner
that says &quot; set next fire here &quot; written in it .
uh , morgan ?
i &apos;ll call you back .
there must be 30 homemade bombs in here .
we need to send our people into every building
a map of the campus .
where &apos;s the blueprint ?
hell no , i &apos;m not leaving .
i have too much to do . all right .
i bought one of those mini halon fire extinguishers .
they started selling them at the bookstore .
it &apos;s pretty morbid , right ?
hey , i &apos;m about to get into an elevator ,
so i &apos;ll probably lose you .
all right , bye @-@ bye .
you got the science building ?
it &apos;s not gonna start .
don &apos;t you have the key ?
i put it back on the hook in the office .
aren &apos;t you supposed to be able to hear the emergency call button ?
maybe it &apos;s broken .
or turned off .
i say we pry open the doors .
you can &apos;t pry &apos; em all the way open .
it &apos;s a safety precaution .
maybe we can try yelling for help .
that &apos;s the fire alarm .
jason , wait . wait , wait , wait , wait .
clara hayes is very likely a good person .
someone who never wanted to do anyone any harm ,
like any other rational person .
research suggests ocd involves problems
what are you trying to say ?
help ! somebody help us !
hello ? somebody help us !
it &apos;s all right .
it &apos;s okay . i &apos;m here to save you .
not yet .
it &apos;s clear up here . anything ?
nothing .
no girl , no smoke , no fire .
where did she go ?
maybe she &apos;s getting the key .
i don &apos;t know .
clara ?
father , son ...
oh , my god !
it &apos;s gasoline !
stop it , clara ! listen !
the guards made sure all floors are empty
and no elevators are in service . hold on .
clara ?
put it down , clara !
she &apos;s failing out . this was gonna be her last semester .
that &apos;s the stressor . what else ?
she was a researcher in the science building .
we know that . they &apos;ve already cleared the science building .
the third floor of the science building is under construction .
i &apos;m on my way .
clara .
i have to do this .
you know it &apos;s not rational , clara .
you were trying to tell me .
god chose me to be tested ,
something terrible will happen .
what &apos;s gonna happen , clara ?
i know . i know . i know .
then resist .
i can &apos;t .
you left the message about charon .
you want to stop .
father , son ...
clara ...
god chose them .
get us out of here .
he said he was just trying to stall clara .
right .
you were just trying to stall him .
you were stalling .
i don &apos;t ?
i looked it up . no one does .
there are some theories about a neurological basis .
but they &apos;re just theories .
what really happened in the convenience store ?
i know how to provoke one .
the key .
13 .
we only found 6 .
i didn &apos;t know you could count .
our profile said you &apos;d be too stupid .
you-- y-- yo-
what ?
th-- th-- the cam--
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re trying to say .
you take the cam--
the cam-- the c-- the cam--
say it .
the ca--
just spit it out . just ...
the cam--
come on !
