We're trained to be vigilant...
to chase down the problem...
What...
to ask all the right questions...
to find the root cause...
until we know exactly what it is...
Dr. Hunt, please.
No, he did not go home for the night.
This is Dr. Yang. Page him.
No, I will hold.
And we can confront it.
You are.
What?
What is it?
Oh, you-- you didn't come home.
Uh, yeah, there was a bus crash.
Wh--uh, what time is it?
What are you-- what are you doing here?
I just, um...
I figured you had a rough night,
so...
I brought you some coffee.
Oh, great. Thanks.
It takes an extreme amount of caution...
Wh-where is it?
I forgot it.
But, um,
you go back-- go back to sleep.
Okay.
Or we can overstep ourselves.
We can create problems where none exists.
Come back to me.
I'm not coming back.
You miss it.
What's to miss about neuro?
Me.
We decided it was a bad idea.
Well, that was before,
when we were trying to get Zola back.
I miss you.
Just come back for one day.
Remember the mystery...
the magic--
Gliomas...
meningiomas...
astrocytomas?
Dr. Webber?
Dr. Webber.
Rise and shine, Richard.
Dr. Avery is here for our bladder surgery.
Oh, right. Right. Oh, right.
Hi, Catherine.
Oh, take your time, honey.
I want to see this bladder you baked. Yeah.
Oh, look at that.
Dr. Keaton.
Homegrown from the patient's own bladder and stem cells.
Beautiful.
All those late-night calls paid off, didn't they?
Yeah, we couldn't have done it without your consultation.
Flatterer.
All right. Well, before we stick this thing
someplace where the sun don't shine,
I'm gonna go and find my son.
And you
should go and find a pot of coffee.
I'll see you before surgery.
Dr. Keaton.
All right.
Late night, sir?
Oh, I'm fine. Um, I sit with Adele
till she falls asleep,
then I like to be there in the morning.
But when do you have time to get some sleep?
I'm fine, Bailey.
I'm fine.
Yes, sir.
Get your scrambled egg off my blanket.
I said I'd bring you one.
You said you weren't hungry.
You are gonna have heart failure at 35.
No, give me another card.
Don't you feel bad, using a distraught mother
to help tutor you?
No.
I feel bad that I had to sit with you all night
so you wouldn't cry yourself to sleep over your sad preemie.
He has a brain bleed.
Mm. No, he barely has a brain bleed.
Look... we expected it.
I'm watching it.
Oh, that's supposed to make me feel good?
You are this close to failing your boards.
Don't even say that.
I know exactly what they'll ask that's gonna take you down.
Is it Robbins?
I gotta go.
It's Robbins. I'm coming, too.
Hey. Have you seen Derek?
Have you seen Owen?
He put me on his service. I told him not to,
and he gives me an arachnoid cyst.
I have to pull the plug on a brain-dead trauma.
I need Owen to approve it.
There he is.
Don't take too much.
That's my lunch. Fine.
All right. Thanks.
Okay, bye.
So he's just sharing his nasty trail mix with someone.
I mean, people do that. It doesn't mean anything.
Cristina.
What?
I gotta go find Derek.
Okay.
Okay, let's go over the game plan again.
If we see my mother...
We're buried with work today.
And... you're sorry, but Jackson has no time
to spend with her, okay?
There you are.
Dr. Avery.
Oh, Dr. Sloan. How nice to see you again.
Now move outta my way
so I can see my boy.
You look skinny.
Tell me you did not forget your tux.
Tux?
Jackson is my date
for the frontiers of medicine benefit tonight.
Oh, this is Dr. Mara Keaton.
Mara is my star urology fellow.
Mara, my son Jackson.
Dr. Mark Sloan.
It's a pleasure to meet you both.
Pleasure to meet you.
Mara's considering Seattle Grace
as an option for next year,
and I thought, well, who better to show her around
than my son?
Dr. Sloan, can you spare him for just a couple of hours?
Absolutely.
Show her around. Take your time.
I-I can't possibly. We are...
buried with work.
Kepner can cover for you.
Perfect.
Perfect.
Perfect.
So this is it?
We do it now?
Unless, uh...
Do you need a minute to say something--
I've said it.
He's been listening to me talk for 22 years.
I'm sure he's grateful for a little peace and quiet.
What now?
We'll turn off the ventilator.
His respirations will stop.
I'll disconnect his monitors and his feeding tube...
And then--
He said this once...
we were watching some dumb movie on TV,
and this guy pulls the plug on another guy...
and he--
he said, "Don't you dare do that to me."
He was joking. "Don't you do that to me.
You leave that plug in the wall,
you put my organs in a jar."
"Don't you give up on me."
Stop. Stop this. Stop it. Stop it.
Stop. I c--I c-- I can't do this.
I can't do this.
Turn--turn this back on.
Turn it back on.
The husband withdrew consent, Owen.
I had already turned off the vent when he said no.
He has medical P.O.A. He said stop. I stopped.
So what are you gonna do?
I'm going to get in on, uh, Teddy's preemie surgery.
No, you're not.
You're gonna stay with him until he gives his consent again.
You want me to try and talk him into it?
No, I want you to help him through it.
I want you to help him understand
that this is the only option left for his husband.
I want you to do your job and find some damn compassion.
Do you need something?
I just wonder if I could help.
No.
I've--I've been with these guys since Michael first came in.
And we've talked. They know me.
Aren't you on nights now?
Well, I can hang around if it'll help.
Well, I don't--I--
Cristina,
she can help, let her help.
Thank you.
Thanks.
So I'm a week out of law school...
First big interview,
huge firm.
I've never had a better interview.
So I stand up to shake hands,
and I pass out--
Right over the coffee table.
Right over the coffee table
with my butt in the air.
And your skirt...
My skirt rides up to my waist.
Not even good panties. Granny panties.
Did you get the job?
No.
Well, your next interview will end much better
once we remove the cyst.
We're gonna perform what we call a marsupialization of the cyst.
We open up the wall of the cyst
so that it can drain freely
and then the fluid won't collect.
So your dizzy spells will stop.
But you said you found a tumor.
We did.
It's a small one. It's called a meningioma.
It's benign, so we're gonna leave it alone.
If it ever does cause a problem,
it's easy enough to remove.
Dr. Grey could do it.
Oh, go, girl.
But the cyst is in the temporal lobe.
That's what's causing the seizures and the dizziness.
We're gonna go after that.
So this is it?
This is it.
We will see you when it is all over.
Thank you.
Ah, Dr. Grey. So glad you could join us.
I've been kidnapped.
She misses me.
She's not even on neuro anymore.
Well, she's thinking about coming back.
I'm not.
She is. She's remembering the magic.
Can he even take heart surgery?
He has to. He has a pericardial tumor
compressing on his heart. He's decompensating.
He has a brain bleed.
Shouldn't heart surgery wait till after it's cleared up?
I wish we could, but it has to happen today.
So Tommy's hip dysplasia can be treated with a harness.
And I brought you a scone since you skipped breakfast.
Oh, thank you.
Pumpkin. Ew.
I'll take it.
Eat that.
Right. Like I can eat.
You didn't eat all night.
You're gonna pass out.
Just eat it.
When, uh, when are you going to do the surgery?
As soon as he's prepped.
Karev will let you know when we get started.
Yeah, I'm gonna scrub in, right?
You just want him to have surgery
'cause it'll look good for your boards.
I do not.
And also I do,
but it's gonna be great for my boards.
Look, he's gonna be fine, all right?
He's not scrubbing in. He was up all night.
Oh, shut up.
Should Karev really be hooking up
with the heart-patient intern mom? I mean--
What? No, he's not.
He spent the night. He gave her a scone.
You gave me a scone.
Yeah, I spend the night with you, too,
because I'm married to you.
No. No. She's his intern.
I mean, he's just--he's-- he's trying to--
To be nice, to care. You know.
I mean, Alex Karev is trying to be more human,
and I think that we can thank me for that.
They're doing it.
They built you a beautiful bladder.
Can I see it?
Oh, honey, no. You don't want to see that thing.
It's nasty.
Picture a bread bowl
like your soup comes in...
Uh-huh.
Only this one is made out of meat.
Oh... please don't make me laugh.
I'm gonna pee.
Oh. Oh, God. There I go.
Oh, sweetheart. I'm so sorry. Ooh.
No, I'm sorry.
It's all right. That should end today.
You won't have to be scared that your bladder will let go
every time you laugh.
Or sneeze
or cough or have sex.
You're gonna have a very full life
when Dr. Avery's done with you.
I like to think that everybody lives a very full life
once I'm done with them.
And there...
We...
Are.
Great.
That's a perfect craniotomy.
Right, Dr. Grey?
You dragged me back into neuro
to watch Lexie do a boring procedure?
Hey, it is not boring.
It is not boring.
It's her first solo cyst.
Be a big sister. Cheer her on.
Shepherd, I've got a motorcycle cop
open on the table with a C-7 fracture.
I need your eyes on the cord. Can you--
All right. I'll be right there.
Okay.
When you, um, marsupialize that,
make sure that you--
Tack the edges. Yes, I know.
She knows what she's doing.
Just observe. I'll be right back.
If you need anything--
We won't. Go.
And this is O.R. Two,
which looks exactly like O.R. One.
You still have to cover the E.R. in the fifth year,
and study for your boards?
Yeah, it's a pretty rigorous program.
Speaking of which, I need to be getting back to work, so--
Do you mind if we watch for a second?
Of course.
God. I thought I had no time for a social life.
Are you still dating anyone?
Am I still dating?
I mean, are you dating anyone?
Tell me about you.
Where'd you go to school?
Well, my dad's the director of surgical science at Oxford,
so I did my preclinical years there.
Oxford.
Then residency at Mass Gen,
then I transferred to the Brigham
to study under your mother,
and here I am.
That's quite a pedigree, isn't it?
Well, you know, a little hard work
and a lot of good timing.
No, I get it.
I totally get it.
Is that Derek Shepherd?
So there's cord damage.
Do you mind if we stay and watch this for...
Just a few more sutures.
God, I have seen some tiny little hearts, but--
This is the tiniest.
His pressure's dropped. What happened?
Doctor, his fontanel is bulging and the pupils are dilated.
His I.V.H.
Brain bleed.
Give me the ultrasound.
Here you go.
Right there.
It's progressed to stage 3.
He's gonna need a ventriculostomy fast,
or we're looking at hydrocephalus.
And brain damage.
Page Marcus.
No, Shepherd should take this.
No, he's in surgery.
Just page Marcus. He can handle it.
No, the kid's getting Shepherd. Just wait for me.
The cyst is draining really well.
Really well.
Great job.
Where is that blood coming from?
It's all right. It's just a little bleeding.
We just have to find the source.
Let's extend the craniotomy a little.
Open her up more?
Yeah. It's okay. Just a little.
Okay. Here you go, doctor.
But I hear stories of people waking up all the time.
Not this. Not brain death.
But--but he's still breathing.
The machine is breathing for him.
When we shut it off--
He dies.
He--he's already--
Your husband has died.
Oh, good.
Okay, this is an E.E.G.
Uh, it's a brain scan of another patient in a coma,
also ventilated.
These lines indicate brain activity.
Um, you can see these spikes going all the way.
If you take a look at your husband's,
it's completely flat.
We've seen no brain activity for the past 72 hours--
Just stop.
Well, I'm--I'm just trying to explain--
Explain to me
how you can tell me that he's dead
and then tell me to turn off life-sustaining treatment.
Explain that.
S--
Sam, you can take your time.
This is a difficult decision.
You should just be with Michael and take your time.
Take all the time you need.
Thank you.
It's okay.
It's okay. I know how hard this is.
Like that?
Uh-huh.
There it is.
Little bleeder. Just cauterize.
Okay. Bipolar.
Here you go.
There. Okay.
Look at that. That's her tumor.
What?
Oh, my God. There it is.
Do we take it out?
Uh, we should, um...
Let's call O.R. Two and find out
how long Dr. Shepherd's gonna be.
I mean, he said it would be easy.
That I-I could do it.
I know, and it's right there.
They said he's just finishing.
He'll be here any minute.
Okay. All right. Well, let's just wait
and see what he says.
Okay.
Cord's clear. Spine is stabilized.
What do you think?
Well, I think his motorcycle days are over.
Hopefully, he'll be able to walk again.
Dr. Shepherd,
we need you in O.R. Four.
It's Tommy. He's got a grade-3 bleed.
He needs a ventric placed.
Karev, slow down.
Who is Tommy?
Uh, Morgan's baby. The intern Morgan.
All right. Well, just give me a second, to, uh, finish--
Can you come now? Please.
Go. I'll finish.
Okay.
Where's your hot tourist?
Yeah, she's not here for a tour.
I'm being set up.
My mom's trying to expand the Avery Dynasty.
You were supposed to tell her we were busy.
You and Dr. Hotness should be getting busy,
if you get my point.
Actually, she should be getting your point.
What are you, 12?
Why are you so obsessed with me getting laid?
'Cause it works for me.
It's called passing on wisdom.
Also pimping.
She's here for one night.
No.
I am not going to give my mother the satisfaction.
It's not your mother you should be trying to satisfy.
Child!
Sam.
Is there...
Do you have any questions I can answer?
No, thank you.
If you could stop circling like a vulture,
I'd appreciate it.
Do you want me to talk to him?
No.
He just needs time to grieve, you know,
to work through it.
He needs to think clearly.
He needs to understand what has happened.
He's losing his husband.
They were going to a grocery store,
just living their nice, boring life,
Going to the same store they've gone to for 22 years,
and a car hits them.
Sam never saw this coming.
Like I said, I just-- I've taken some time
to get to know them--
Are you married?
Um, have you ever been married?
No.
Then stay out of it.
You have no idea what you're talking about.
You don't know Sam.
You don't know the first thing about what he needs.
There you are.
What are you doing here?
We're finished. The cyst is draining.
She did great.
And get this-- Lexie resected the meningioma--
Perfect margins.
She was perfect.
You did what?
Took the tumor out.
Why the hell would you do that?
The plan was to remove the cyst.
She did not consent to that surgery.
The tumor was right there.
Are we supposed to close her up
and put her through another brain surgery?
You should've paged me.
I did, twice. Derek, Lori is fine.
Lexie took her to recovery. Her vitals are great--
We won't know how she is until she wakes up.
I should've known better.
You should've known better. Give me the scans.
I want to know everything that you did in there.
Poor woman.
50 years old,
and she has to wear adult diapers to go on a date.
Kind of takes the magic out of...
"Let me change into something
a little more comfortable."
You're terrible.
She probably saved herself some trouble.
By her age, all the good ones are already snapped up.
Tragedy, isn't it?
Mm.
I'm ready with this new bladder
if anybody's interested.
Uh, yeah. Bring it over here, Dr. Bailey.
Dr. Avery.
I seem to have lost track of the other Dr. Avery.
May I scrub in with you?
No, you may not scrub in with me.
I gave you a job to do, Dr. Keaton.
But surely--
Do you want to go to the benefit tonight or not?
Yes, ma'am. Of course.
Good. You lost him. You go find him.
Benefit? Hmm. Sounds like fun.
Fun? It's exhausting.
Once upon a time, I was Catherine Fox.
Ever since I've become an Avery,
every fund-raiser, gala-charity brouhaha
that comes along,
I gotta squeeze into some pantyhose,
get zipped into a couture gown and represent,
and every time you go into an O.R.,
they expect you to do
Harper Avery Award-winning work,
even though I can never win a Harper Avery.
The name comes with way too much pressure.
You can crumble under it,
burn out.
Happened to Jackson's father.
I do not want it to happen to Jackson.
Yeah, it's a--it's a lot to hold up.
Don't you wish you could just go back sometimes?
I would love to just be Catherine Fox all over again.
I was so much more fun back then.
Oh, you're still fun now.
I am, huh?
Glad you noticed.
You try the cafeteria, too?
Jambalaya?
Disgusting. Why do they even try?
April's got, uh, yogurt.
And leftover something.
So Lexie removed a tumor from a woman today,
and now Derek's all worried that we gorked her.
Mm. Did you?
No.
Well, I've spent the entire morning
with Owen's stupid nurse.
Owen's nurse.
The stupid I.C.U. nurse.
Well, that's not what you said.
Oh, and you know what? This is really good.
Kepner can cook.
Freakin' jambalaya day.
It's like a hearty bowl of salmonella.
Hey, how long have you been screwing the intern
with the preemie?
What?
Morgan?
I am not.
Uh, well, you both were in the on-call room this morning...
before dawn.
Yeah, studying.
You're feeding her.
Alex.
No. Bad dog.
Shut up. I mean, she's... my intern.
And she's a patient.
This is gonna turn out like Rebecca.
Oh, yeah. Smashed-up face?
Oh, that... that was bad.
Yeah, she's gonna fall for you,
and then she's gonna go crazy
and then she's gonna pee on my couch.
Oh, gross.
Go to hell, the both of you.
Okay, just keep her off my couch, please.
Are things with Owen any better?
Is that my turkey casserole?
Oh, yeah.
How do you keep the crunchy onion things so crunchy?
I put them in last.
Come on. I looked forward to this all day.
Delicious.
Stop Facebooking my mom, all right?
Uh, I'm not.
Really? Then how does she know I broke up with Lexie, hmm?
Why is she here trying to hook me up
with some junior urologist?
Hey.
Hey, those are mine. They have electrolytes.
I showed her around half the damn hospital
before I realized I was on a blind date.
You told me to unfriend her. I did.
Hi. I'm looking for Dr. Avery.
Oh, yes. He's right there.
Oh. There you are.
Yeah.
Shall we continue?
Let's do that.
That's great.
Cristina?
Drop it.
We were talking.
No, you were talking. I said drop it.
I'm fine.
Everything is fine, really.
I thought we could check out your cafeteria,
Get a bite to eat, talk.
Listen, Dr. Keaton.
Mara.
Yeah, you're very nice, okay?
But I am not really interested.
I'm not sure what you mean.
Obviously my mom thought there might be
some kind of connection or something here.
But I'm sorry.
I'm just not looking for...
A hookup?
Or whatever.
I see.
You think I'm being served to you
like a concubine?
No, I didn't...
I'm not here to service you, Dr. Avery.
I'm here to serve your mother for a grade.
And she has tasked me with digging up as much as I can
about your boards, your standing, your love life.
And when you're gonna stop screwing around in plastics.
You're not a setup. You're a spy.
I rank this task slightly above wiping vomit from bedpans.
But your mother is a very demanding woman,
and if you know anything about her,
you know I can't go back empty-handed.
So if you're really sorry
and not just a presumptuous pig,
you would do a girl a solid, and you will tell me
whatever it is you want me to tell her.
And you can do it in the cafeteria,
because I'm bloody starving!
Not a chance. It's jambalaya day.
Come with me.
Where is Lexie?
I told her to go wait for the labs.
It's going to be fine.
Oh, God, honey.
We're Lori's parents.
We were in Rome. We just got here.
I'm Dr. Shepherd. This is Dr. Grey.
How is she?
Lori's surgery went very well.
Her vitals are excellent.
We won't know more until she comes out of the anesthesia.
Oh, she's starting to come around.
Hey, Lori. How are you doing?
Hmm? Let me look at you, okay?
Well, responses are good. Follow this for me. Up.
Down.
How you feelin'?
Honey, we're right here.
Oh, that's a good sign.
Hi, sweetheart.
It's called aphasia.
The part of the brain that helps control
how she forms words was damaged in the surgery.
There is a chance, with therapy,
that she will regain some of her function.
Some?
What the hell did you do to her?
Mr. Bosson...
I am sorry. I...
I had the best intentions.
It was an outcome that I did not foresee.
I'm sorry. I made a mistake.
We're suing you.
She's 27 years old. You ruined her life.
Honey, honey--
We are going to sue you.
Honey, stop. Lori can hear you.
It was my mistake. You weren't even in the room.
My mistake was leaving you two in there alone.
I can't believe you would do this.
I thought, if you had seen the tumor--
You didn't think at all.
Okay, it's my fault. Let's just let it be my fault.
This will kill Lexie.
It'll destroy her confidence.
Does she even have to know?
Of course she does.
She's not strong enough.
Then she shouldn't be a surgeon.
Hey, did she wake up yet?
I am telling you,
Dr. Webber was amazing.
He cradled your bladder in those big ol' hands
like it was his own little baby.
Oh, my God. Stop it.
And I said to him, I said, "You got a fat, ugly baby."
Stop. I'm gonna pee.
Ooh, wait. Mm.
I'm not gonna pee?
No, baby. You are not going to pee.
I'm not gonna pee!
Oh, okay.
Wait, wait, wait.
Oh. Here we go. Okay.
Satisfied customer.
Ah. We are quite a team, aren't we?
Hey.
You know what would make this thing fun tonight?
If you came with me.
I've got jackson coming,
but I'd much prefer a grown-up along.
I-I wish I could.
I-I mean, I really do, but...
You know what?
I'd be honored to join you.
Yes. Okay.
Can you get a tux?
Sure.
Oh, this is gonna be so much fun.
You have to stop
thinking of this as giving up on Michael
and try to see it as helping him.
Emily.
It's a hard step.
But it is his next step,
and he really needs you right now.
How can I do this when he said not to do it? How?
It would've been better if he died in the crash.
He'd be just as dead,
but you wouldn't be feeling like this.
This way...
He's died in slow motion.
On Monday, his heart ruptured,
and I repaired it.
But on tuesday, his lungs collapsed.
By thursday, his kidneys failed,
and the sepsis and infection
took three more days to kill his brain.
Sam...
If he had died in the crash by the side of the road,
if you had seen him zipped up in a bag
and driven off,
he would be every bit as gone as he is right now,
but you would know it.
And you could take some comfort in that.
I didn't know him. You did.
But I would imagine he would have wanted you
to have that comfort.
Bring me the papers.
You're an Oxford-educated surgeon. Come on.
I know! It's insulting.
You think I like snooping around
after her slacker son?
Watch it.
The woman has no sense of boundaries.
Yeah, she does.
She just hates boundaries so she ignores them.
You gotta set boundaries with her. You gotta tell her no.
No. Have you met her?
She'll fire me.
No, actually, she'll respect you.
You gotta tell her no,
and then when she gives you those big, sad eyes--
No, she doesn't make those eyes at me.
When she glares at you with disgust and disappointment...
Bingo.
That's when you stick to your guns.
I don't have guns.
I'm unarmed.
You are not unarmed.
You have guns. I can tell.
When we took out the tumor,
we damaged broca's area.
So she can understand speech
and she knows what she wants to say,
but she can't say it.
Okay, well, just tell me that he can fix it.
He can't. It's irreparable.
What do you mean? I mean...
She's not gonna be able to talk?
She's 27. She...
He ha--he has to fix it.
I mean, there ha-- there has to be something.
There isn't.
I mean, this is my fault, too.
I shoun't have let you do it.
Oh, God.
Oh, my God. She...
I... it--it--it--it-- it was right there.
And I mean, I-I-I never would've done it if...
You saw it. I mean...
I know. I know. You're not gonna cry right now.
You're gonna go and talk to Derek.
And he is gonna be pissed and disappointed
and he's gonna scream at you
and he won't look at you for days.
Just take it.
And you'll move on and you'll learn from this
and you will never make this mistake again.
Yeah, his heart's good.
Ventric's draining well.
And you got 2-for-1 surgeries.
Your son's a gold mine.
We're lucky to have you as his doctor.
Since you're about to fail your boards
and... work at a bar.
Stop saying that.
I'm gonna go see my boy.
You and Morgan a thing?
No. No. Her dumbass boyfriend bailed.
She just needs someone to keep an eye on her.
She's my intern.
Right.
You ever see one of those gorillas
that likes to cuddle the little kitten
and raises it as its own?
It's called imprinting.
The, uh, scared little kitten
lets the big gorilla cuddle it
because there's no mama cat around
or, you know, the dumbass cat boyfriend left town.
That... this isn't that.
Watch out,
'cause... she's smitten.
She is not. Y-you know what?
Go watch your animal channel or whatever.
Big dumb gorilla.
Getting all ready for your date?
It's not a date.
It's a function with a colleague.
Mm-hmm. Does she know that?
What do you mean?
I mean, the way you two have been flirting with each other all day.
I am not flirting.
Well, why do I feel like I need a shower?
Are you suggest--
Look, I am a married man
with a wife in a nursing home.
I know that.
I am not--oh, God.
I love my wife, Bailey.
Oh, Dr. Webber, I know you love your wife.
You're killing yourself because you love your wife.
You're not getting any sleep, you're trying so hard
to make sure she knows she's loved.
G-give me that.
Come here.
You can give yourself a break.
Okay? Everybody in this hospital
flirts with everybody else.
It's fine.
You're a good man.
I know it. We all know it.
But I don't know if Dr. Winky Pants knows it.
Well, I'm just sayin', there's flirting for fun
and then there's flirting for profit.
I know which one you're doing.
That's everything?
Uh, yes. It's just a matter of time now.
Okay.
Thanks.
Damn you.
Damn you.
This is why it took me three years
to tell you that I loved you
and another three years before I moved in with you.
You thought I was scared to commit?
I was scared of this--
Scared of how much I loved you,
scared of the feeling
that I'd never be able to find happiness without you.
That's what I was scared of. I was scared of this.
This right here.
Oh... Damn you.
Dr. Yang, can I do anything?
Can you stop screwing my husband?
Oh, my God.
I have no idea why
I am even bringing any--
Okay, you gotta listen.
You gotta listen, please.
Don't touch me.
I'm not... we're...
Dr. Hunt and I are-- are not...
I flirt with him.
I do. I'm a flirt.
It's just how I get through a long shift.
But I flirt with everyone, and I swear, it--
it does not mean anything, and we have never done--
You switched to nights.
Well, I switched to nights because my boyfriend--
I have a boyfriend. Here.
Here. Call him. He'll tell you.
And do you want to--do you want to look through
my text messages? You can--
Stop. Just... stop.
Dr. Yang, I am so sorry. He's just...
He's the chief. I would never...
I swear.
I'm sorry.
You stick to your surgical plan.
You find a tumor, you find anything...
You close up, and you make a plan for that.
I know. I-I-I know that.
Do you?
Do you? Because if you had taken the time to look,
you would have opted to approach the tumor from this angle...
and Lori would be speaking right now!
It's just stupid--
A stupid, arrogant mistake.
You stick to your-- you stick to your surgical plan.
You make an incidental finding...
Don't you look fine?
Mom, Mara has something to say.
I...
I don't really.
Sure you do.
Dr. Avery and I have decided
we won't be joining you tonight.
Oh?
Unless, of course, you really want me to, and--
Guns.
Since you brought me across the country
to run a personal errand for you
when I could've been
gaining valuable surgical experience...
There you go.
I've decided to take the night off.
I'm going to do what I want to do with my time
and you can just--
You want to stop right there.
Yeah, you're done.
So you captured my spy.
She will be very well treated.
Now you have fun.
Okay? Fly safe. I love you.
Doctor.
Doctor.
Doctor.
I was gonna uninvite you all anyway.
I have a date.
Rough day, big guy--
Pericardial tumor and a grade-3 bleed.
But you're still kickin'.
Hey, you about ready to go?
Uh, almost.
Uh, hey.
Can you take another picture of us?
You know, just for me to have tonight.
Of course.
Alex.
Get in here.
Oh, no, that's cool. It's, uh--
Get--get over here.
Okay. One.
Two. Three.
All right.
She's a smitten kitten.
You look lovely.
I thought you were gonna stand me up.
Well, I'm afraid I am.
I'm sorry, Catherine. I can't go.
Is this because I've been flirting with you all day?
No. No.
Oh, come on, Richard. You know I'm just having fun.
Your wife has nothing to worry about.
My wife has Alzheimer's.
How bad?
It's bad.
She's in a care facility.
I go see her every night.
She usually doesn't know who I am.
She knows I'm a friend, but...
She's not there.
And I miss her. I miss...
laughing and talking.
I miss feeling like a man,
not just a friend.
Anyway, today,
I wasn't lonely.
Today I felt like a man.
And it felt good.
So...
I don't trust myself going to dinner with you tonight
and my wife needs me.
And I need to see my wife.
Richard,
You are...
a good man.
You know that?
I'm trying.
Thank you...
for a lovely day.
You sure you want to change?
We could go somewhere nice,
somewhere where you could look that amazing.
Actually,
I'm really not that hungry.
No?
Could you help me with my zipper?
Can you help me a little bit more?
Our intentions are always pure.
We always want to do what's right.
But we also have the drive to push boundaries.
So we're in danger of taking things too far.
We're told to "Do no harm"
while we're trained to cut you open with a knife.
Are you okay?
No.
Are you thinking about Lori?
This is why I can't come back to neuro.
You can't even look at me.
It's no good for us.
I know.
You want to talk about it?
No.
Do you want to take your mind off it?
No.
Do you want me to leave you alone?
No.
So...
We do things...
when we should have left well enough alone.
Because it's hard to admit when there's no problem to treat...
You're awake.
You didn't come home.
Yeah, there was a--
A bus crash or a train crash
or a patient crashed?
Yeah. Right.
To let it alone...
Why are you staring at me?
Well, I'm weighing how upset you are
and if I want to get into this.
You do. You want to get into this...with me.
I'm tired and it's late.
You know what? That's the point.
It's always late, and it shouldn't be.
And you should want to get into it with me
but you don't.
I mean, where are you?
I am--I am here.
For God sake.
I'm right freakin' here. I'm home.
No, you're not.
Before we make it so much worse...
Before we cause such terrible damage.
You have to beonest with me
because I am going crazy here.
Do you, um, do you love me anymore?
It's not about if I--
Owen, please answer the question.
I love you so much that it hurts.
Okay.
Well, okay, then. Then we can--
we can work on this. We can talk.
You know, we-- we have to talk,
Because I cannot be like this anymore.
And I mean it when I say that I'm going crazy,
'cause...
'cause that nurse Emily--
I mean, I-I accused her of sleeping with you.
You what?
I'm--I'm sorry. I just-- I mean, I feel like...
my whole body feels like...
like you were cheating on me.
And then you come home and you tell me that you love me,
and I'm... i'm--I'm--I'm relieved.
I mean, I'm so relieved because--
Stop. Stop.
I said I love you so much that it hurts.
Okay.
I said...
it hurts...
to love you.
Just say it.
I'm not cheating on you with Emily.
Okay.
