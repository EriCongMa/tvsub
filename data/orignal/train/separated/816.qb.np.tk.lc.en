not bad , winston . i &apos;ll tell you what , man .
you look like the funny guy from police academy
who does the @-@ the voices ,
and different sounds .
god , i wish marketers had a uniform .
to winston bishop ,
owner of cats ,
taker of baths , graduate of the lapd .
we are so ...
i &apos;m so proud of you !
what ?
i &apos;m so proud of you .
you &apos;re proud of me ?
when is this night construction gonna stop ?
i actually don &apos;t mind it .
gets me ready for all the loud action
on the job , you know what i mean ?
something has got to change .
well , don &apos;t worry , &apos; cause i have called the city &apos;s
automated help desk and i &apos;ve also sent out an e @-@ mail
to information @ losangeles.gov , so action has been taken .
jess , don &apos;t you know how democracy works ?
we need to get out there and grease palms , blackmail people .
we need to send them an envelope filled with fake blood
and @-@ and a note that says ...
&quot; i know . &quot;
what ?
as if ... as if we know what &apos;s really going on .
schmidt , you do realize
you &apos;re saying this in front of a police officer .
i &apos;m so sorry .
a little respect .
can i try on your uniform ?
no . this uniform is
for official police business .
looking good , man .
yeah .
we got a code jewish , code jewish .
you &apos;re under &quot; ch &apos;arrest . &quot;
i can &apos;t believe winston &apos;s gonna be a cop .
i mean , he &apos;s the gentlest person i know .
he once broke his arm wrapping presents .
remember when he made this ?
he &apos;s the sweetest guy in the world , man .
he &apos;s just so nice and ... vulnerable .
yeah .
although ...
don &apos;t know what this is for .
hey . what are you guys doing ?
uh , n @-@ nothing , man .
look , i &apos;m a little worried about you , okay ?
and so is coach .
kind of worried about you , man .
guys , calm down . i understand ,
i get it , and i &apos;m ... and i &apos;m flattered that
you &apos;re concerned about me ,
but i signed up for this , remember ?
also , my training officer is gonna be with me
the entire time .
he &apos;s got a partner .
i forgot about the partner .
that &apos;s huge .
we &apos;re silly .
yeah . yeah .
it &apos;s supposed to be a real bad @-@ ass , too .
was in a biker gang for three years , undercover .
can &apos;t go back to arizona no more .
is that true detective ?
apparently eats bullets as a party trick .
great , that &apos;s really good .
that makes sense , what are you , uh ...
yeah , yeah , definitely .
what &apos;s that ?
what the ... ?
which ... oh , that ?
it &apos;s a , uh ... it &apos;s a project .
i &apos;ve had a report of people
acting lame back here .
ow , jess !
also , i tazed schmidt .
all right , seriously ,
no more playing with the uniform .
officer leslie biggins .
okay , biggins .
so bishop &apos;s gonna be next , okay ? come on .
all right , here we go .
officer hank bishop .
eh ... oh , that one .
officer win ...
... field bishop .
well that &apos;s gonna cause a lot of mix @-@ ups over at the station .
officer winston bishop .
winston ! winston ! winston !
winston ! winston ! winston !
winston ! winston ! yes !
winnie !
sorry .
wow , a lot of city officials around here .
maybe somebody can help us with our noise problem .
okay , enough of this by @-@ the @-@ book nonsense .
it &apos;s time to play hardball .
be a shark , jess . not a dolphin .
right .
so i shouldn &apos;t be the smartest and friendliest
creature in the ocean ?
that makes sense , bro .
sharks eat whatever they want .
dolphins-- they jump
through hoops ,
so , yeah , i think it does make sense .
no , it &apos;s awesome , bro .
okay , stop mockingly saying &quot; bro . &quot;
my uncle was arrested for having sex with a dolphin .
what ?
what ?
carry on .
i &apos;m having a lot of difficulty nailing you down , ryan .
oh , there &apos;s councilwoman fawn moscato .
she &apos;s from our district .
yummo .
where do i place my ballot ?
she better get ready ,
&apos;cause she &apos;s about to have a very friendly conversation
with a concerned citizen ... bro .
okay , jess , it &apos;s not gonna do anything .
won &apos;t make a difference . like what i did there
with the ballot thing ? it was a good joke , right ?
didn &apos;t get the reaction i thought
it was gonna get from you guys .
no , we got it .
we got it , bro .
oh , i get it .
you know what , i &apos;ve seen the bollywood movies ,
i &apos;ve seen the uk office .
not a fan , not a fan .
congratulations . these are from all of us ,
but i &apos;m the one that got them for you .
wow , they &apos;re big .
so , winnie ,
where &apos;s your bad @-@ ass training officer ?
oh , guys , i would like for you to meet the person
who will be training me as i brave the mean streets of l.a. :
officer aly nelson .
she &apos;s so small .
what ?
excuse me ?
you &apos;re so small , you &apos;re ...
what is happening , bishop ?
i think what he was
trying to say was that , um ...
yeah ?
we were expecting someone who looks
a little more like a cop in the traditional sense .
that &apos;s what i meant .
no , no , no .
wow .
i &apos;m not trying to offend you ,
we were just expecting , like , uh ,
either a really strong man or kind of like a guy
with , like , a mustache .
got it . and flowers are a ...
that &apos;s a normal thing to give to a grown man ?
or are they trees ?
i can &apos;t tell , i &apos;m so small .
cool friends , bishop .
no , wait .
officer nelson , just ...
thank you . thank you very much , you guys .
oh , also , thank you for the flowers .
and just so we &apos;re clear , the first thank you was sarcastic ,
because you embarrassed me , but the second thank you
was sincere as hell , because these flowers are glorious !
you &apos;re welcome .
i &apos;m sorry about the construction noise .
it &apos;s an issue close to my heart .
i do charity work with deaf children .
of course , they would welcome the noise ,
because it would mean they could hear .
let me let you in on a little secret .
just go to the public works website
and download this form .
you &apos;re a dear , fawn .
i made a pun and i didn &apos;t know it .
you &apos;re too much .
schmidt ,
this is fawn moscato .
she was just giving me a shortcut to file
some complaints about the noise .
looks like someone brought a shark
to the dolphin show .
that &apos;s a dolphin noise .
ah . very good .
councilwoman moscato , excuse my trembling ,
but it &apos;s an honor .
your head is enormous .
why , thank you .
so you &apos;re taking her out to dinner ?
that &apos;s your plan ?
i &apos;m intoxicating a single , overworked public official
with the pleasure of my company .
which i will then parlay
into getting her to fix our problem .
are my sleeves even ? this is ridiculous .
you know , my new tailor sews like an army medic .
i &apos;m not being overdramatic when i say that i would rather
sit naked on a hot grill
than wear something off the rack .
schmidt , just don &apos;t screw this up .
she &apos;s a decent woman .
oh , excuse me .
at some point in the evening , can you let me know
that i have a call from karl lagerfeld ?
schmidt .
bob , how are you ?
tony , love you in a chino .
guillermo , fire up that grill . fawn &apos;s hungry .
i &apos;m fawn moscato .
and i approve this scotch .
oh , goodness .
okay , so i &apos;m almost finished with form 7d42,
but i &apos;m not sure what to put down for landlord &apos;s birth city .
ooh . what you doing , hot shot ?
i was feeling saucy . i &apos;ve had a glass of red wine .
red wine makes you bonkers horny .
i &apos;ll make you a deal .
when i finish a form ,
you can take off an article of clothing , and that way ,
when i &apos;m done , then we can just go nuts on each other .
deal .
hey , i &apos;m not finished yet .
this is america ! wear pants !
red wine . sorry !
sorry . sorry . very sorry .
sorry . sorry . geez . yeah .
so , tomorrow &apos;s your first shift , huh ?
you gonna play the name game ,
do something fun and safe like that ?
dude , i &apos;m gonna be in a patrol car the entire time .
i just got a text from my buddy reynolds .
working his first shift ,
he got stabbed in the leg by a little girl .
i love reynolds , man . he makes me laugh .
that &apos;s funny .
you think that &apos;s funny ?
to be stabbed by a little kid , yeah .
on the job .
right . &apos; cause you get paid .
that you &apos;re about to do .
right , &apos; cause it &apos;s a child , and it &apos;s hilarious .
you don &apos;t like getting cut .
you &apos;re very physically sensitive .
i am . paper cuts give me headaches .
i can &apos;t wait to meet him . yeah .
maybe he &apos;ll stab me .
guys , chill out , okay ?
i told you , i got my partner
to protect me , remember ?
the little one ?
the one would could take a nap in a match box ?
which reminds me-- i &apos;m gonna make her a sandwich tomorrow .
i might even throw in a crossword puzzle
with winston @-@ related clues
so she can get to know me better .
&quot; who likes cats ? &quot; winston , across .
i don &apos;t like this .
his training officer can &apos;t protect him ! she &apos;s too tiny .
she looks like she won the silver medal
in athens for the balance beam .
girl could drown in a raindrop .
i mean , that &apos;s girl &apos;s ...
i mean , she ...
i can &apos;t think of one &apos; cause i &apos;m so worried about winston !
i &apos;m worried about him , too , but i can still think of &apos; em .
uh , girl &apos;s so , uh ... ugh !
she looks like a persian webster .
girl &apos;s like a pepperoni .
why are you here ?
we brought you a gift .
assorted candies . please enjoy .
they are delicious .
now , i &apos;m sure you have friends and family of officers
coming in here all the time to check on them .
no . no , this would be a first .
really ? this is the first ?
what do you guys need ?
well , we are here because , uh ,
winston is our best friend , as you know , and , um ...
... we &apos;re worried about him .
yeah .
and i &apos;m not saying that you &apos;re bad
at your job as a training officer .
but i &apos;m not saying you &apos;re good at your job .
and that &apos;s why we &apos;re here-- to kind of see where you &apos;re at ,
to see if you &apos;re ready
to protect our asset , our dear friend .
let &apos;s @-@ let &apos;s be diplomatic .
did bishop put you up to this ?
does he have some sort of
problem with me being his training officer ?
not at all .
oh , he is going to pay for this . he is going to pay .
he shouldn &apos;t pay for this . this has nothing to do with him .
this is about us .
okay .
first of all , you shouldn &apos;t get mad at him . get mad at us .
get out !
it &apos;s good to see you .
get out .
okay .
yo . ry @-@ guy .
i finished printing out the forms .
let &apos;s get goofy .
come on !
you got a real dudley moore thing
going on right now , and i like it .
jessica day , i think i &apos;m in love .
sorry . did you just say you were in love ?
that woman is a dynamo .
so let &apos;s talk about the whole construction noise thing .
has anyone ever told you you look like a jewish kennedy ?
i hope not , because that would be offensive .
what ? i thought you were supposed to be some kind
of big shark , and you were playing her .
about the noise .
given the many considerations-- traffic , budget ...
okay , what is happening ?
what are you doing with your thumb ?
we feel it best to proceed with the given strategy .
she played you !
i know , and it was wildly arousing !
but let me tell you something , jess .
she played you , too .
no , she didn &apos;t . no , she didn &apos;t .
i filled out the form , i submitted it .
here &apos;s the confirmation , right here .
&quot; thank you for your inquiry .
we will respond in 360 to 500 days &quot; !
isn &apos;t she great ?
she can &apos;t just walk all over the people of the city
like the jolly green giant .
jolly green giant ...
he doesn &apos;t stomp on people .
he encourages them to eat their vegetables .
you can &apos;t let her do this ! we have to keep fighting !
she &apos;s taking me to a ribbon @-@ cutting ceremony
at a carniceria tomorrow .
you know , jess , i really think
that she may be grooming me to be her arm candy .
this could be a real bill and hillary situation .
you , sir , are no bill clinton .
i know . i &apos;m hillary .
well , you &apos;re not hillary , either !
i am , too , hillary !
hey , man , can you be the one to walk away ?
&apos;cause i just , like ...
my little sleeping british bulldog here is gonna wake up ,
and he &apos;s gonna get scared if i &apos;m not there .
yeah , i got you . yeah .
a bunch of neighbors have joined the fight .
see , if you put out an honest message ,
you get good , honest people to help you .
per municipal code 2b ,
construction is prohibited at night .
however , this project &apos;s been issued a waiver
that we are trying to revoke .
now , i &apos;m going to mash a muffin into the phone .
you tell me if it makes its way through .
you &apos;re doing a great job , dave .
it &apos;s important to keep it positive .
so , what happened to schmidt ?
i don &apos;t need him . i got this on lockdown .
yes , it is banana @-@ walnut .
now i &apos;m gonna tell you the story
of how my daddy spawned with a pony
and made the mud boy-- that &apos;s me .
&quot; chapter one-- mama &apos;s house . &quot;
make sure they &apos;re sharp .
it &apos;s political suicide to not cut the ribbon on the first try .
of course . look , if there &apos;s anyone
who understands the importance of a sharp knife ,
it &apos;s a jewish man .
hey , listen , about the construction issue ...
we &apos;ve discussed that .
look , changing that schedule &apos;s a logistical nightmare ,
not to mention the people it &apos;ll piss off .
the sewage lobby &apos;s involved in that project , and trust me ,
you don &apos;t want to cross them .
did they shoot poopy everywhere ?
how old are you ? no . no , they just ...
they contribute money to my opponent .
of course . no , i @-@ i knew that .
they ... why would they shoot poopy everywhere ?
got it .
hey , listen , i wanted to warn you .
my roommates have recruited a gang of derelicts
to @-@ to protest the council meeting .
if only there was someone who could oppose them .
of course , i can &apos;t , because it &apos;s technically a citizens &apos; forum .
are you saying that i should ?
i &apos;m not saying anything .
okay .
you &apos;re trying to manipulate me again .
you must think that i &apos;m a real shmendrick .
well , i love it .
when we &apos;re in public ,
yeah .
let &apos;s just tone down the jewish thing , okay ?
let &apos;s tone down the jewish thing . yeah .
i can do that . 100 % . let &apos;s tone down the jewish ...
hey , by the way , sir ,
thank you so much for keeping the councilwoman safe .
five stars for arman !
he &apos;s an uber driver .
i &apos;m a councilwoman , not a senator .
okay , i felt like that ...
first day on the job . is this where
you tell me to forget everything i learned in training ?
n @-@ no !
remember everything .
bishop , if you have a problem
with me being your training officer ,
put down your ice cream cone ,
take your frickin &apos; thumbs out of your mouth ,
and say it to my face !
what ? ! i don &apos;t have a problem with you .
did you or did you not
tell your roommates to come check up on me ?
what ? ! they did that ?
yeah .
oh , my goodness , i am so &quot; furiated &quot; right now !
i am very lucky to have you as my training officer .
my roommates don &apos;t speak for me .
i promise you will never have to see them again .
they &apos;re right there . they &apos;re literally right there .
oh , yeah , yeah , they see .
they got us .
hey . yeah .
hey .
when you step to the badge , the badge step back .
don &apos;t ever say that in my car again .
what the hell are you two doing here ?
and why are you talking to aly behind my back ?
she said that you guys gave her weird unwrapped candy
and then you stole toilet paper from the station bathroom .
we need that toilet paper .
because we &apos;re worried about you !
we &apos;re trying to protect you .
what ?
she &apos;s so small , winston .
you guys should have faith in me .
i got a badge , i got a diploma , and i got a special
plastic thing that goes over my hat for when it rains .
we got a 339 in progress at 62 sage brush .
that sounds dangerous . stop him !
hey , what are you doing ? what are you doing ?
we can &apos;t let you do this ! we &apos;re trying to protect you !
what the hell is your problem ?
this is scary !
we &apos;re not letting you go on the street !
this an obstruction of justice .
that is an obstruction of ...
you won &apos;t die on my watch !
i can &apos;t give you these &apos; cause i care about you .
nick . nick .
nick , give me the keys .
don &apos;t give &apos; em back !
we love you , man ! we love you !
coach , you know i can &apos;t jump that high !
don &apos;t test me .
we &apos;re protecting you .
give me those damn keys right ...
ooh , no , no , no , no ... !
that &apos;s what you get !
i can &apos;t go to jail .
i &apos;m too sarcastic for the white gangs .
yeah , man , i &apos;ll get passed around in there like a bong .
shut up .
you &apos;re not going to prison .
the dangers of noise pollution are real .
according to the world wide web ,
it can cause lack of concentration , nervousness ,
and misunderstandings .
sir ! sir ...
clearly , manual labor has sculpted your body perfectly ,
but could you please be quiet ?
sorry , lady , i gotta work all night .
but , sir , people live and work here .
babies sleep , dogs nap by the window .
immigrants share noodles
and dance to records with abandon .
you &apos;re right ! we should be looking out for each other .
you said it , handsome guy .
but you know who else should be looking out for us ?
the city .
would you stop clapping ? this is an abomination .
by the way , he ... the only reason he got that role
is because he &apos;s sleeping with her .
you want to get a cheeseburger sandwich ?
my nights just freed up .
of course .
that sounds great now that i can hear you .
what ? what are you doing ?
mm . nothing .
the cuffs on your jacket just look a little short .
what ?
they just look a little short .
why are you telling me this now ? i got a new tailor .
i &apos;m really insecure about it .
my god .
i &apos;m jessica day .
thank you for listening .
tone it down ! stop the noise !
ah . n @-@ noise .
n ... noise .
where would ... where would we be without you ?
i don &apos;t know .
a tree falls ,
a cabin is made , uh ...
it just ...
this doesn &apos;t @-@ doesn &apos;t look right .
a woman screams ,
a b ... a baby is b ... a baby is born .
maybe if the speaker would stop fiddling with his jacket ...
it just doesn &apos;t feel like these are ...
he &apos;s saying all the right things .
that son @-@ of @-@ a @-@ bitch tailor ruined my jacket .
that @-@ that baby that screamed becomes a man
and that @-@ that was the story of abra @-@ abraham lincoln .
how dare you evoke lincoln !
he was our quietest president !
i feel ... i &apos;m just so ...
i &apos;m so uncomfortable right now , because of my sleeves .
i feel like an idiot up here in this jacket !
nobody &apos;s telling me my @-@ my ...
the tailoring is off ! i &apos;m going ...
i &apos;m seeing ... i &apos;m seeing a new tailor , everyone .
sir ?
my tailor &apos;s great .
i &apos;ll give you his number : eight .
i look like a freaking matador in this thing !
oh , no ! oh , no ! oh , no !
sir , we &apos;ve heard enough .
stand down ! you look weak !
considering the incoherent and , frankly , disturbing argument
from the pro @-@ noise lobby , i have no choice
but to recommend a switch to the day schedule ,
effective immediately .
new york !
what ?
i &apos;m fawn moscato , the people &apos;s warrior .
you &apos;re welcome , los angeles !
tomorrow is a new america ! good night !
hello again .
i would like to once more revisit
the bottomless clause of the public nudity ordinance .
oh , my god , i almost hired that guy as a sub .
so that was a huge failure . i feel like a democrat .
why &apos;d you have to say that about my jacket ?
all right . okay , look , jess told me to .
i mean , i thought your sleeves were fine .
and by &quot; fine , &quot;
i mean i could not care less .
oh , hello , shark .
i am woman ,
the smartest species of them all .
i didn &apos;t realize i &apos;d finished that .
i &apos;ve been waiting here a while .
you underhanded pig woman .
you know , there are certain things that you don &apos;t do ,
and exploiting a man &apos;s love of tailoring is one of them .
which makes what you did all the more impressive .
well , i felt dirty .
i felt like evil winston .
remember when winston was evil for that week ?
i can &apos;t believe i blew it with fawn .
you know , she said that we could have sex
in the room where o.j. tried on the glove .
schmidt , it doesn &apos;t matter what happened at the meeting .
she doesn &apos;t care about you .
she &apos;s a power @-@ hungry ,
self @-@ obsessed woman who just wants a man to shut up
and look pretty . that &apos;s not what you want , is it ?
please take me back .
look , i was duped by a doe @-@ eyed pixie
and her indian henchwoman . forgive me .
it &apos;s fine .
it actually worked out . you were such a jackass
up there that no one who supported the construction
will be able to hold it against me .
plus , i picked up a ton of votes .
or as i like to call them ...
tiny orgasms .
so let me get this straight .
you let me humiliate myself ,
in public , for your own political gain ?
yes .
you &apos;re the sexiest woman that i &apos;ve ever met .
ah ... ms. moscato , wherever you &apos;re going ,
take me with you .
please .
it &apos;s &quot; councilwoman . &quot;
and i &apos;ll call you when i need you .
that is gonna be ...
so frustrating .
but i love it .
why are we in a church ?
i once saw a priest
drop his keys and bend over and pick it up ,
and it was just so human that it ruined religion for me .
it &apos;s a support group for families .
pack it down . and you pack it down .
and now weird friends .
... until one day , what happens ?
and i know that his training officer is scary strong .
but , um , he &apos;s still my friend ,
and the bad guys are still bad ,
and i just wish i could put him in a giant envelope and just ...
just mail him away from all the bad guys ...
there &apos;s no shame in this .
do not judge this man .
we won &apos;t . this is a support group .
i know what you &apos;re thinking : he looks like a little punk .
he looks like a little boy .
we @-@ we try not to call names here .
everybody look down . don &apos;t look at him !
good first day , bishop .
you never look at a man when he cries !
thanks .
back me up , man .
you ever let your friends try on your uniform ?
what ? no .
oh , yeah . me either .
don &apos;t do it . i &apos;m serious .
don &apos;t do that .
i won &apos;t . i won &apos;t .
i &apos;m telling you ,
you gotta keep clear !
what ?
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m not driving you to the e.r. this time !
it &apos;s your problem ! get out of the way !
don &apos;t look at me like that !
all right , all right !
morning , jerry !
hey , how you doing ?
how are you doing ?
eh , different day , same bucket , right ?
is that today &apos;s times ?
kristof &apos;s got a piece on net neutrality .
it &apos;s very complex .
i don &apos;t know where i stand .
what kind of bagel
you want this morning-- uh , poppy seed or sesame ?
i &apos;m going sesame today .
all right .
get me a little schmear , would you ?
