第一季 第十四集
i love you , nate archibald .
always have , always will .
i love you , too .
what is wrong with you ? this is not who you are .
i know who blair and those girls are ,
but i know who i am ,
and i &apos;m not gonna forget that just &apos; cause i hang out with them .
we &apos;re not supposed to talk , remember ?
i can &apos;t help myself . i never should have let you let me go .
i will not base my personal life on your preferences .
dan is my boyfriend .
i would rather be chuck &apos;s stepsister than dan &apos;s .
lily , would you do me the honor of being my wife ?
he proposed before we left , and i &apos;m going to say yes .
take care , rufus .
how glad are you to see our families merge , sis ?
so glad that if you ever call me that again ,
it &apos;ll be the last thing you ever say , chuck .
unless you want dear nathaniel to know
how you lost your virginity to me in the back of a moving vehicle ,
i encourage patience and restraint .
isn &apos;t there someone else you can torture ?
look , i know you &apos;re friends with blair ,
but if you know something ... well , blair was never really my friend .
so ... so , yeah , there &apos;s something you should know .
what a bitch. oh , my god. she is such a slut !
i made a decision i was in no condition to make .
i want nothing else to do with you , blair .
it &apos;s over .
you held a certain fascination
when you were beautiful and untouched .
i don &apos;t want you anymore ,
and i can &apos;t see why anyone else would. what are you doing here ?
i was just leaving. no , stay .
consider yourself dethroned , queen b .
jenny , if you walk away from me now , i will ruin you .
how are you gonna do that ?
my whole life is falling apart. stay and fight .
we &apos;ll get through this together. promise ?
promise .
and who am i ?
that &apos;s a secret i &apos;ll never tell .
you know you love me .
x.o.x.o. , gossip girl .
cat ?
cat !
cat !
cat !
cat .
you don &apos;t have a cat , jenny .
my name is blair .
you don &apos;t have anyone .
but i &apos;m blair .
i &apos;m blair !
ms. blair. ms . blair .
ms. blair .
wakey , wakey , upper east siders .
spring break is done , and i &apos;m starved for the dish .
were you sunning in capri or sinning in croatia ?
give me the deets .
oh , what &apos;s happening ?
you have bad dream ,
and you &apos;re sleeping with your chocolates .
oh , lady godiva , my only friend .
and has anyone spotted our ex @-@ queen b . ?
where does the dethroned royalty vacation these days ?
club bed is over. first day back to school .
i can &apos;t , dorota . i don &apos;t feel very well .
serena come to get you soon .
call her and cancel .
and cover my mirrors .
i &apos;m in mourning for my former life .
chuck , i &apos;m serious !
are you done yet ? this is my bathroom !
it &apos;s late ,
and not to mention disgusting .
chuck !
what are you doing ?
all right , ladies. my sister needs to shower .
make room .
i &apos;m just messing with you .
i can &apos;t believe you lit up in my bathroom .
well , if i lit up in mine , then the folks would know it was me , sis .
oh , okay. let &apos;s get one thing straight--
our parents may be insisting on blending our households ,
but i am not your sister .
i do not share any of your d.n.a. ,
nor do i ever wish to .
then i suggest you get new hand towels .
okay .
it &apos;s imperative that i bathe .
can you just get out ?
you know what ? fine. just forget it .
next year , we &apos;re doing spring break in maldives .
skiing is too dangerous. you broke your arm in the spa .
oh , here , hazel. thanks for letting me borrow it .
what is this ? the bracelet you lent me in aspen ?
oh , yeah. you know , you could &apos;ve just kept it ,
and i would &apos;ve forgot i had it .
girls , how excited are we ?
party tomorrow night for jenny at socialista . i know !
it &apos;s gonna be my best birthday ever .
i heard the mojitos are amazing .
wait till you get your mouth around a mini cuban. oh , i don &apos;t , um--
it &apos;s a sandwich .
oh. wardrobe , ladies ?
my ferragamo clutch and whatever dress i buy today to go with it .
ooh. what about you , j . ?
oh , i &apos;ve got some dresses on hold at bendel &apos;s. there &apos;s an a.t.m. , jenny .
you said you wanted to hit it .
you know , to pay penelope back for brunch ?
oh , uh , yeah . $ 120 , right ?
yeah , i don &apos;t feel like stopping .
you can get the next one .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m hiding from my valet .
he wanted to put my socks on for me this morning .
your servants are very attentive .
you should meet brigita-- new latvian maid .
no. no , no , no , he should not meet brigita. he &apos;s 14 .
avoid this person. may i remind you , serena ,
that you used to have a sense of humor ? no .
morning , father. hey .
morning , kids. morning .
and how is lily von bulow today ? oh , i have a headache .
i had a very frustrating conversation
with the wedding planner this morning .
well , may i say aggravation becomes you ?
you may , but i won &apos;t believe it .
so ... first day back at school , huh ?
honey , you didn &apos;t , uh , want to shower ?
i have to go meet blair . eric ?
you go ahead. we &apos;ll take the limo .
as my best man ,
i expect you to keep things smooth until the wedding .
best man ?
i &apos;d be honored , sir .
to family .
i came straight from the airport
to take jenny to school , and she &apos;s already gone ?
she slept at hazel &apos;s last night. oh. who &apos;s , uh , who &apos;s hazel ?
her new friend ,
the girl whose family she went with to aspen .
yeah , i was actually surprised you let her go
and cancel on mom like that. well , your mom was in complete support of it .
jenny was very well taken care of .
i spoke to her every day , twice from the , uh , private plane .
private plane ?
it &apos;s the best early birthday present
we ever could have given her. oh , so you paid for it ?
well , i gave her pocket money .
yeah , jenny &apos;s happier than she &apos;s been in a long time .
hey , whenever you &apos;re done with that &quot; i &apos;d do things differently &quot; look ,
two things--
one--i can &apos;t seem to nail jenny down
on what she wants to do for her actual birthday. oh , you know ,
i &apos;ll get it out of her .
good. and , uh , two--
what the hell are you still doing here ?
mm. thank you .
at least you get to wake up from your nightmare .
i &apos;m living with mine .
thank god i have plans with dan tonight .
finally , the return of some normalcy !
b. , what are you doing ?
giving homeschooling some serious consideration .
look , i know you think
everybody &apos;s still talking about you ,
but your 3 @-@ week @-@ old @-@ scandal is ancient news .
did you even hear the dirt that happened over break ?
who would i have heard it from ? dorota ?
well , after much concerted effort ,
maya finally made it into brody jenner &apos;s cell phone .
oh , and kati &apos;s dad moved her entire family back to israel. yeah .
and constance &apos;s bad @-@ girl @-@ turned @-@ good ...
serena van der woodsen ...
moved in with chuck bass .
yeah. so you &apos;re thinking this whole thing could have blown over by now
come on .
that , too .
don &apos;t worry , b .
the french revolution had cake .
come on. let &apos;s go .
the american revolution had tea .
but looks like the overthrow of blair waldorf ,
well ...
who said you need a silver spoon to dole out just desserts ?
hey , jenny .
can i talk to you just for a second ?
um , i &apos;ll meet up with you guys , okay ?
hey , so i may have told blair
you told me the truth about her and chuck ,
and i &apos;m sure she didn &apos;t react well to that .
but you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re dealing with here .
i &apos;m not scared of blair , nate. no , i &apos;m not talking about--
i &apos;m talking about your new circle .
i mean , they &apos;ve been friends with blair forever ,
and look what they &apos;re doing to her .
you fall out of line ,
what do you think &apos;s gonna happen to you ?
well , then i won &apos;t fall out of line .
i &apos;m not saying you &apos;re gonna ...
it &apos;s just ...
you &apos;re not like those girls , jenny .
that &apos;s weird , nate. since they &apos;re my friends ,
you &apos;d think we &apos;d have some stuff in common .
okay .
well , i will give you this--
you &apos;ve got good aim .
look , i know this is hard for you , b . ,
but you can &apos;t let them beat you .
you &apos;re blair waldorf , remember ?
right. right. these are my steps ,
and i &apos;m not going to relinquish them without a fight ,
though it would be helpful if there was one more person in our crowd .
only old people and children and--
ugh , there &apos;s chuck
with a blond mini @-@ chuck .
he &apos;s trying to torture me .
i ... i can &apos;t believe it . i know .
does little j. actually think that she &apos;s anything but their lackey ?
so since when does nate archibald have
so much to say to jenny humphrey , hmm ?
why ? you guys don &apos;t like him ?
penelope &apos;s only had a historic crush on him since the 20th century .
since you and nate are so tight , maybe you can broker that .
yeah. maybe .
they what ? they &apos;re taking her out to dinner
for her birthday tomorrow night--
table rvice at socialista .
so jenny humphrey is officially being inscribed on the a @-@ list .
wait. how do you know this ? because they invited me ,
but i said no out of deference to you .
i just thought i could have dinner with her and dan and the whole family .
how do you manage to get out of everything unscathed ?
because i &apos;m nice. you should try it sometime .
come on. um , compliment me. tell me my hair looks beautiful .
but your hair looks disgusting. did you even shower ?
b. , i say this out of love ,
but your being a bitch
is what got dairy in your hair in the first place , okay ?
be nice and neutral , and things will swing back to normal .
you &apos;re the queen b . , so just let nature take its course .
i &apos;m going to model u.n. , but we &apos;re dining tonight , right ?
butter , 7 : 00. oh , um , i don &apos;t know if i can go out again tonight .
why ? what are you doing ? do we have a reservation ?
yeah , i mean , doesn &apos;t it take , like , 2 weeks to get a table there ?
not if you slip the mare d &apos; $ 100 .
oh , and dot forget , j.--
you owe me .
you know , i &apos;ve got a better idea .
what &apos;s she doing ?
what does she think she &apos;s doing ?
she &apos;s giving you the perfect opportunity for niceness .
come on. no .
yes .
serena , i know that you &apos;re doing something
with dan tonight , but , blair , um , we &apos;re all going to butter ,
and i was wondering if you wanted to join us. she &apos;d be delighted ! yes !
butter .
great .
great !
very nice .
thank you .
have you always looked this good ?
you look so good to me .
you look so good to me ,
and you smell ... mmm , so clean .
mm , you &apos;re not gonna tell me the chuck shower story again ,
are you ? no .
good .
dan .
chuck. how are you ?
excellent. enjoying having family around .
can you just get it over with , chuck ?
say whatever pervy thing you &apos;re gonna say and just leave ?
the wedding caterer is presenting a tasting to the family .
i was coming to call you to dinner. okay , i &apos;ll take off then .
no need .
i already asked the staff to set a place for you .
i have to say i prefer the chestnut pappardelle .
yeah , the foie gras is a bit rich .
you know , i &apos;m--i &apos;m , uh , slanting heavily towards
the venison fellow. it &apos;s fallow .
fallow. fallow , exactly. fallow .
oh , for me ?
thank you .
who &apos;s it from ? i don &apos;t know ...
but it says &quot; open immediately . &quot;
do i have to refrigerate it ? no , it &apos;s not from me . i don &apos;t know .
oh. oh , don &apos;t put your dirty package on the table .
if i had a dime for every time i heard that .
that &apos;s enough , chuck .
porn and handcuffs ?
really ?
oh , my. wow .
this is low , chuck , even for you .
what ? i didn &apos;t send this .
excuse me .
uh , could you ...
oh , yeah. my pleasure. uh , it &apos;s not--that &apos;s not what i--
i didn &apos;t mean that .
it &apos;s , uh ...
it &apos;s trash . i &apos;ll throw it out .
spotted--blair waldorf , alone at butter .
i &apos;m sorry , miss ,
but it--it looks like your friends aren &apos;t coming .
humiliated--party of one .
can &apos;t you just picture her sitting there ?
every time someone comes in the door ...
&quot; ah ... it &apos;s not them. ooh , no , not them . &quot;
not going to butter
is so much better than going to butter .
my new nanette lepore for jenny &apos;s birthday .
gorgeous .
right ?
what &apos;s the birthday girl wearing ?
oh , i &apos;m still deciding between two dresses at bergdorf &apos;s .
i thought you said bendel &apos;s .
bendel &apos;s. right .
oh , it &apos;s my dad .
is , are you wearing your black chanel ? hello ?
which one ? you know , i never wear the same thing twice .
mommy taught me well. hey , dad .
you missed dinner , kiddo. oh , yeah , um , i &apos;m studying at hazel &apos;s ,
and i guess i lost track of time. um , i &apos;m not mad .
i just feel like i haven &apos;t seen you in a while .
we haven &apos;t even discussed your birthday. um ,
i was gonna do something with my friends ...
oh. that &apos;s great , honey .
but since i have nothing to wear ,
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s happening anymore .
well , if you want to be with your friends ,
we can do the family thing over the weekend .
sweetheart ?
uh , yeah . i &apos;ll be home soon , dad .
okay. bye .
hello ? hi .
oh , no check , honey. the drink &apos;s on us ,
unless you want something else ?
yes .
another bellini ,
the seared squab ,
and a bus person to separate the tables ,
please .
one may be the loneliest number ...
information. what city and state , please ?
brooklyn . i think that &apos;s in new york .
but sometimes only the lonely can play .
wake up , little jenny. the bitch is back .
i thought you said you didn &apos;t have anything else .
well , i found some stuff in the back of my closet .
mm @-@ hmm. do you want to go with cash again ,
or do you want to buy your sewing machine back ?
neither . i want that dress .
honey , this is $ 1,200 .
well , this one &apos;s ... quite lovely .
yeah , well , that &apos;s more my color .
i say we take the jet to croatia ,
where young eric here can exploit the lesser age of consent
i &apos;m invited to the bachelor party ? brother , please .
and then head west to monte carlo
for some all @-@ night cards at metropole ,
then swing by giza
just to watch the sun come up over the pyramids .
what do you think , father ? i think we &apos;re here .
uh , see you at home , bart.
chuck will catch up in a minute .
you almost ruined things between me and lily once before .
i &apos;m not gonna let that happen again .
what are you talking about ?
i &apos;m talking about that vulgar stunt you pulled at dinner .
i didn &apos;t send serena that package ,
and quite frankly ,
her violated virgin mary act is getting pretty old .
i thought making you my best man would help .
what is that supposed to mean ?
inspire you to value my happiness
above your own childish agenda .
things seem to be working out for you at that club , victrola .
i &apos;m thinking you might like me to invest more in the place ,
so you can have more control ?
in exchange for good behavior , of course .
you &apos;re bribing me ?
so we have a deal then ?
hey , why aren &apos;t you at school ? i &apos;m taking the morning off .
volunteering to help those less fortunate than myself .
wow. you &apos;re in a good mood .
butter with the girls must have gone well last night ?
i didn &apos;t go , actually .
why not ?
i figure they should work a little harder for my forgiveness .
hey , dan &apos;s not hanging out in brooklyn again this morning .
he &apos;s with you at school , right ? um , no , not yet , but he &apos;ll be here soon .
why ?
just tell him i say hi .
okay .
hi .
jenny &apos;s dad ?
we met briefly at thanksgiving .
hi .
i got three cases of champagne for serena van der woodsen .
oh. no , no. i @-@ i &apos;m serena van der woodsen ,
but those aren &apos;t mine .
well , the purchase order never lies. salud .
whoo ! you guys , get over here !
she must have been so angry . i would be livid .
hey , guys , i just got this incredible dolce .
you wanna see ? it &apos;s unbelievable .
you can &apos;t turn your back in your own house .
what are you guys talking about ?
my mother &apos;s valentino was stolen. oh , my god .
it was made especially for her .
it was the same year he did , uh , jackie o . &apos; s lace wedding mini .
well , did someone break in ? no , and the maid swore to the police
that she didn &apos;t take it , but she &apos;ll probably get fired. wait ,
police for a dress ?
it &apos;s worth , like , $ 15,000 .
my mother told imaculata if she returned it ,
they could work something out. like she &apos;ll bring it back .
well , you never know . i mean , it could turn up .
right , &apos; cause really , where is she gonna wear it ?
i &apos;m really glad , because when i spoke to her ,
she mentioned the plans with the girls falling through .
nope .
tell you the truth , i didn &apos;t really believe her. why ?
i thought she was just conflicted about choosing friends over family .
well , you know that &apos;s the biggest struggle with a girl her age .
memory doesn &apos;t serve ...
trying to reconcile who you &apos;re becoming with who you used to be .
she &apos;s been running herself ragged , mr . humphrey .
straddling two worlds ? well , i know she was running herself ragged
trying to get into one of those worlds--
picking up dry cleaning , gowns for masked balls ...
well , it &apos;s no easier once you &apos;re in .
she needs some relief .
well , then that &apos;s what she &apos;ll get .
whatever i can do to help .
oh , thank god .
betty ? hi. excuse me. um ...
would you pardon me for a moment , please ?
i need to trade back .
all right , you can keep the scarf and the shoes ,
but i need to give you this one in exchange for the red one. well , honey ,
i &apos;m sorry , but that &apos;s just not gonna be possible. what ? why ?
you know , when you leave here with an item ,
you &apos;re agreeing to its value .
the dolce sold at $ 1,200 .
the valentino ... is seven times that .
please , look , this has sentimental value ,
and i didn &apos;t realize-- no , i &apos;m sorry .
a couple of hours ago , this dress was mine , all right ?
it doesn &apos;t even have tags on it yet .
look , it &apos;s not my fault
that you don &apos;t know what a valentino &apos;s worth .
hello ? nate , it &apos;s jenny .
what &apos;s going on ? listen , i wouldn &apos;t be calling you
if i had anyone else to turn to ,
but i made a mistake , and i need to fix it ,
and i really need to borrow some money. wait , wait . jenny , just slow down .
i promise i &apos;ll pay you back. is everything okay ?
yeah , i just--i made a mistake , and i need to fix it. well , how much ?
$ 8,000 .
$ 8,000 ? jenny , what do you need that kind of money for ?
you know what ? forget it . i &apos;m sorry i bothered you .
the price of fitting in might have gotten a little steeper ...
but little j. still knows
it &apos;s what &apos;s underneath that counts .
well , we could put this one on a mylar tablecloth
and pretend it &apos;s a bar mitzvah .
oh , there you are . i have a date with dan .
could you excuse us ?
you &apos;re gonna say something worse than the bar mitzvah remark ?
serena , i think we should talk about any feelings
you might be having about my upcoming marriage .
okay , but you &apos;re asking me this now because ...
because i got a call from your headmistress
who said that there was something
about a case of alcohol ?
well , i thought you may be acting out .
right , mom . i actually woke up this morning , and i thought ,
&quot; hmm . i &apos;m a little uncertain about my mother &apos;s wedding .
&quot; why don &apos;t i invite the entire junior class
out to the courtyard for a champagne toast ?
&quot; you have pulled things like this before .
obviously , chuck &apos;s master plan is working .
i can &apos;t believe you think chuck is doing these things .
looking good to everyone in my life isn &apos;t enough for him .
he has to make me look bad or crazy .
well , chuck may be eccentric , but i doubt he &apos;s diabolical .
what &apos;s he done now ?
i &apos;ll tell you what he &apos;s done .
surprise !
happy birthday , jenny .
um , dad , i ca--i can &apos;t believe you did all this .
and , uh , blair &apos;s here .
um , this is so great
that all of you are here
in my house .
uh , i should go change .
uh , you got it ? okay .
i don &apos;t think she was surprised .
what &apos;s blair doing here ? i don &apos;t know .
this party &apos;s kinda weird . &quot; weird &quot; ? it &apos;s time for its induction
to the birthday hall of lame .
so not what i pictured
when the guy on the phone said &quot; loft party .
&quot; i can &apos;t believe we gave up our table for this .
mint mojitos at socialista ,
mint milanos with jenny &apos;s dad .
he &apos;s kind of a hottie .
yeah , a hottie dad .
how long do we have to stay ?
rice krispie treats ?
you can &apos;t believe how mad bart was. yes , i can ,
&apos;cause you &apos;ve told me about three times .
i wonder what they &apos;re gonna do to him .
i wish i could see his face .
you know what ? i &apos;ve got some stories , too ,
uh , about seeing my mother
for the first time since she left at christmas .
i &apos;m the worst girlfriend. no , you &apos;re not. no , you &apos;re not .
and there &apos;s the funny visit to my grandma
at the old folks &apos; home--
two women , a sponge bath and a bedpan . i &apos;m sorry. you &apos;re right .
i wanna be here right now with you .
and--and nate. what ?
hey , guys .
sorry to interrupt. your mom told me you guys were here .
can i speak with you for one second , dan ?
uh , yeah. yeah , sure .
all right. okay .
hey , so have you spoken with your sister at all today ?
no , no. why ? what &apos;s wrong ? i @-@ i don &apos;t know. she just called me .
she was really freaked out , didn &apos;t know where to turn .
she asked to borrow $ 8,000. what ? why ?
yeah , i don &apos;t know . i tried to get her to tell me what was going on
but she wouldn &apos;t say anything .
please ? dad , just get out , okay ? i need to change !
honey , can &apos;t you tell me what &apos;s going on ? nothing , dad , okay ? just leave !
why are you crying ? are you upset about the party ? no , i &apos;m not .
can we just talk about this later , okay ?
i really just need to get out of this dress .
uhh , it &apos;s stuck !
okay , all right .
just help me , okay ? help me get it off .
jenny , you have to calm down. no , hurry up .
did you get it ? i need a pair of pliers .
dad ...
sorry. sorry. we were just looking for our wraps .
i &apos;ll get them .
oh , my god .
that &apos;s my mother &apos;s dress .
no , you guys , i got this at--at resurrection .
remember , i was telling you
about the really great dress i bought ?
her mother &apos;s one @-@ of @-@ a @-@ kind valentino
that just happened to disappear from her closet ?
she must &apos;ve given it away and forgotten or something .
are you calling my daughter a thief ?
well-- excuse me .
this feels private , so i &apos;m gonna head out now .
i have a table at butter .
reservation &apos;s under waldorf , in case there &apos;s an after party .
spotted-- jenny in a red dress
with the red hands to match .
looks like utter disgrace is the name on the label .
blair said they told you
the original party had fallen through
so that they could surprise you with a better one .
blair &apos;s a liar. you got played .
she also said that you were afraid
the girls wouldn &apos;t accept everything about you .
she knew you were wrong. she wanted you to feel
like you had nothing to be ashamed of .
was that a lie , too ?
where did you get the dress ?
and i know you didn &apos;t make it ,
because your sewing machine is gone .
you have no idea how hard it is , dad .
i sold my sewing machine , okay ?
what ? yeah , and a lamp and some jewelry .
why ?
because i had to .
dad , you think that you can just send me off to school
with a plaid skirt and a metrocard , and everything will be okay .
i am not apologizing for not having a private plane for you , jenny .
you think i &apos;m ashamed of where i come from ?
no , dad , what i &apos;m ashamed of
is having to bring a brown @-@ bag lunch to school ,
and , you know , eat it in the bathroom ,
and then go out with my friends
and pretend that i &apos;m not hungry
when i go to lunch with them .
you don &apos;t have to do those things , jenny .
you &apos;re making a choice .
what don &apos;t you get ?
do you want me to choose to have no friends ?
well , clearly ,
i mean , that &apos;s not even a choice anymore ,
because that &apos;s just done .
i should probably get back .
well , thank you for staying with me
while i hid out from my house of horrors. oh , no problem .
oh , do you think jenny will be all right ? yeah , dan &apos;s a good guy .
he &apos;ll take care of her .
you are , too , you know , a good guy--
a forgiving guy
who can &apos;t pit himself against blair forever .
good night . i &apos;m sorry. you gave me an opening .
i couldn &apos;t resist . i &apos;m just saying .
how are you doing , man ? night .
where have you been ? therapy .
for four hours ? um , well ,
before i was--i was playing wii tennis with chuck
at this guy named brantforth &apos;s house ?
why are you hanging out with him ?
brantforth ?
chuck is fun , okay ?
he &apos;s cool to me , and he doesn &apos;t treat me like some freak
that just out of the ostroff center. who treats you like that ?
uh , guys at st. jude &apos;s , the girls at constance ,
sook at the korean deli on 75th street . eric ...
and he &apos;s not--he &apos;s not always careful around me ,
like--like one bad thing , and i &apos;ll break or something .
besides , i always wanted a brother .
i &apos;m trying it out , you know ? here .
what &apos;s this ? chuck said it came for you this morning .
he thought you might want to open it out of the house ,
just in case. why didn &apos;t he bring it to me himself ?
because he thought you wanted him to stay away from you .

that you might be turning into some hideous upper east cyborg .

than the things that those girls have , really .

i am laying down some house rules. no need , princess .

if the family bonded without me for a while .
