For over a century I have lived in secret.
Until now.
I know the risk, but I have to know her.
What are you?
I'm a vampire.
You must be Ms. Pierce.
Please. Call me Katherine.
I was never in love with you, Katherine.
So none of my feelings were real.
Believe what you want, Stefan.
But I know the truth.
So, the black sheep returns.
Tyler?
Who's the guy with Carol?
Mason Lockwood.
You know where I can find any family artifact stuff?
I'm just lookin' for this old piece of my mom's.
It's a moonstone.
I think the Lockwoods have a family secret.
They're not vampires. They're something else.
The lycanthrope.
Werewolves?
It was you.
I've had her blood.
Katherine obviously killed her.
"A" plus "B" equals...
I'm starving.
Katherine.
Don't be frightened.
We're going to have so much fun together.
Look who found his dancing shoes.
Uh! No touching, Mr. Salvatore. Those are the rules.
I thought you didn't believe in rules.
My brother's still upset that you chose me to escort you.
Well, Damon needs to concede
that his younger brother is a better dancer.
Oh, looks like he found someone to occupy his time.
Elena...
Stefan, don't.
Elena!
It's your turn.
Be prepared to lose.
It hurts, doesn't it?
Now you know how I feel.
Don't fight it, Stefan. You loved me once.
You can love me again.
I love you, Stefan.
We'll be together again.
I promise.
Hey. You OK?
Yes. Bad dream.
Go back to sleep.
Katherine.
You have to admit I am getting better at this.
It was easy to get inside of your head.
Have you completely forsaken your nature?
Are we really going to do this again?
We both know I could rip you to shreds
and do my nails at the same time.
What do you want?
I wanted to see you.
I've missed you, Stefan.
Indulge me for a little while, please?
Why are you back in town?
3 reasons.
You, you, and you.
See, I can't quite get that down.
It just kind of--ahem-- gets stuck in my throat.
You know, it's the truth.
Deep down inside that gorgeous body of yours
is the Stefan that fell in love with me, too.
What do you want?
So this is where you spend your time
when you're not stabbing people in the back.
I tricked you into telling me the truth.
That's not stabbing you in the back.
That's using your own tactics against you.
Where are you going?
I made myself clear, Damon.
I want nothing to do with you.
Ok. See you at Jenna's barbecue.
How did you know about Jenna's barbecue?
It was my idea.
Jenna went to high school with Mason Lockwood.
So I figured a social gathering would be a good way
to get to know the guy.
So, I told Rick to tell Jenna...
Does Jenna know that you're going to be there?
Because she's not exactly a fan of yours.
Thank you.
I'm hoping this peach cobbler will pave the way.
What are you up to?
I'm gonna go put some silver into Mason Lockwood
and prove he's a werewolf.
See you at the barbecue.
Hey, Mason, you got a second?
Nah, man, barbecue at Jenna Sommer's house.
Come on, give me 2 minutes. All right?
You can't keep dodging me. I'm freaking out over here.
Tyler, what do you want me to say, man?
Yes, I turned into a wolf.
No, it's not gonna happen to you.
How do you know that?
Because you're not gonna trigger the curse.
Your dad didn't know anything about any of this.
Neither did I till it happened to me.
How does it get triggered?
Ignorance is bliss. Trust me.
You blow back into town with some supernatural family secret
and you expect me not to ask questions?
I can't say anything more. I'm sorry, Tyler.
It's just better for you if I don't.
You ever find that moonstone?
Do you know where it is?
What's so special about it?
I told you. It was my mom's.
It's sentimental.
Look, don't worry about it.
Forget I even brought it up, all right.
See ya later.
You shouldn't read someone's journal.
I know. I'm sorry.
It was just too tempting, all your inner thoughts and feelings,
laying there on your desk for me to read.
Damon's private stock.
That's right! You don't do human.
I read that.
I also read about your recent werewolf sighting.
That must have come as a surprise.
What do you know about werewolves?
I know not to pet one.
Their bite kills, Stefan.
It's best to stay clear of them during a full moon.
And how do you know this?
Who do you think was responsible
for ridding this town of vampires in 1864?
The founding families.
Spearheaded by?
The Lockwoods.
You remember the Founder's Ball, don't you?
The one that you were dreaming about?
I was your escort.
That was before you and Damon knew about my little secret.
Everyone, will you please join me in raising your glasses
to my good friend George Lockwood.
George, thank you for so bravely defending the south.
My honor, Mr. Salvatore.
After all, someone had to do it.
May I have a word, Miss Katherine?
Grab a glass, Henry. It's a celebration.
Please, Miss Katherine.
I looked into those attacks from the other night.
It wasn't vampires.
That's good news, Henry.
That means we have nothing to worry about.
I'm afraid you don't understand.
Those folks were torn apart in ways I've never seen before.
Then...
it won't be long before the founders draw up an investigation.
We'll leave town immediately. I'll tell the others.
Relax, Henry.
This is town is our home,
and the vampires are my family.
I won't let anything happen to us.
From the moment I met George,
I knew he'd be a problem.
So, you're saying that all the Lockwoods are werewolves?
The werewolf gene runs in the Lockwood family.
Not that they're all wolves.
How many other werewolves are out there?
I mean, is it just... limited to the Lockwoods?
No. There are others. Not many.
They're practically extinct.
They mainly exist now in books and really bad movies.
My turn to ask a question.
Why did you keep this picture?
Why not burn it? Tear it up?
You wanna know why I came back?
Well, I have a better question.
Why did you?
For Elena?
No.
You came back here to fall
in love with me all over again, didn't you?
What is it about you...
that makes me still care?
Now, where were we?
That's right.
You were gonna tell me why
you came back to Mystic Falls, weren't you?
You didn't have to do this.
Answer the question.
I came back for you.
We're gonna play by my rules now.
What are you doing?
Answer the question.
You're going to torture me now?
I'm going to do whatever
it takes to get you to tell me the truth.
Later that night at the Founder's Ball--
I don't wanna hear anymore stories about the past.
Yes, you do, Stefan.
That's exactly what you want to hear.
She's all alone.
Does this mean I can finally have you all to myself?
Your father's outdone himself.
Knowing father, he'll want to
throw a Founders Party every year.
I must admit I am rather
surprised that you'd come looking for me.
Because you're the rope in the Salvatore brother's tug-of-war?
No, because I'm a vampire
who could kill you in your sleep.
I beg your pardon?
Relax, george.
I know you know my secret.
This conversation is over.
And I know your secret, too.
And I know that you're extra strong. Only not as strong.
How do you know who I am?
You think that I would
settle into a town without knowing my enemies?
What do you want?
What did he want?
Thanks for letting me invite Caroline.
She could use a day of distraction.
She's not the plus one I'm worried about.
Why is Damon coming?
Because Alaric is a pity-taker.
Come on, Jenna. Be nice.
I'll be nice when Damon learns to keep his paws off you.
Ahh, good news. Found the shot glasses.
That would be my exit.
You're here for 10 minutes and already I'm back
under the bleachers at the pep rally.
Just like old times, huh?
Only I didn't swipe this bottle from my old man.
Oh, the expensive stuff. I like you already.
Just happy to be invited.
Thank Rick. This was his idea.
Really?
Yeah. Well, you know.
I thought it'd be nice to
meet some of Jenna's old high school friends.
Dig up a little dirt.
Oh, I've got dirt. I've got dirt.
I have no secrets. Only dirty shame.
To dirty shame.
Cheers.
Damon.
We were just doing shots. Let me get you a shot glass, buddy.
Here.
Use mine.
She doesn't like me very much.
We haven't met. Mason Lockwood.
Oh, sure. Hey. Damon Salvatore.
I know. I've heard great things about you.
Really? That's weird. 'cause I'm a dick.
Hey. I'm just checking in.
Did you get my message about Jenna's barbecue?
Call me when you can.
Was that Stefan?
He hasn't called me back.
I'm trying to decide if I should be worried.
I'm sure he's fine.
God, I cannot stop eating.
Stefan says it's a great way to sublimate the cravings.
It's horrible.
Fighting the urge for blood every minute of every day.
I know Stefan really hates that part of himself.
Well, yeah. And he hates that you're a constant temptation.
He said that?
Hmm. The desire to rip out your jugular
every time he's with you?
Trust me, it's there.
It's why I had to break up with Matt.
Hey, food's ready. Come get it.
Finally. I am starving.
We can sit here as long as you want.
And when you start to desiccate,
there's a tomb with your name on it.
I've been doing all the talking. It's your turn.
Do you pretend to be human when you're with Elena?
Is that the appeal?
Actually, I don't pretend to be anything
when I'm with her.
That's the whole point.
I get to just be myself.
Does she know that you love me?
I don't.
That's where you're wrong, Stefan.
Don't you remember bringing me home that night?
Your family had taken me in.
I had a lovely time, Stefan.
How long do you plan on staying in Mystic Falls?
As long as I'm wanted.
Your father has been very kind to give me shelter.
How could not?
Losing your family in the fire.
I'm grateful you made it out of Atlanta.
So, I gather I'm wanted?
Very much so.
I know we've only known each other for a short while.
And I know I'm in competition for your affections.
But...
I've never met a woman quite like you.
I look at you and I see an angel.
I touch your skin...
And my entire body ignites.
I kiss you and I know that I'm falling in love.
I am in love with you.
There's just so much you don't know about me, Stefan.
More to learn and love.
I must say goodnight.
I've upset you?
No.
You haven't upset me.
You've just surprised me.
Till tomorrow.
What are you doing here?
I told you I would come.
Well, I'm tired. You should go.
Did my little brother's confession overwhelm you?
You shouldn't eavesdrop.
Is my love not enough?
I told you. I'm tired.
I wish to be alone tonight. Please leave.
Good night, Katherine.
Go ahead, Stefan.
Torture me, keep me captive,
drain me of blood until my body turns to dust.
It'll never change the truth.
I never compelled your love.
It was real. And so was mine.
Dress! Ballerina!
Puppy! Puppy!
Puppy with a tutu.
No.
Dog. Hound dog.
You ain't nothing but a hound dog!
"Dances with wolves."
Mason wins...again.
How is that a wolf?!
Aunt Jenna's getting tipsy.
Will you stop playing her with alcohol?
I want her to like me.
How's operation Lockwood?
He's my new BFF.
There you are.
Isn't this fun?
Yes. Thank you so much for inviting me.
Did I have a choice?
I know what you must think about me.
No, you don't.
You've never dated you.
I have dated many yous.
Well, I'm a work in progress.
These are fancy.
Thanks. My mother's silver set.
Hearing the truth after a century and a half of denial
must be overwhelming.
It wasn't real. I remember you compelling me.
Only after I showed you who I really was.
You were so scared of me.
I had to take away your fear.
Well, whatever feelings I had back then...
they've all turned to hate.
Love, hate.
Such a fine line.
I can wait.
Anyway, George Lockwood was causing all sorts of trouble.
He used the vampires to cover up his own tracks.
He told the founding families about us.
But he was willing to strike a deal.
What kind of a deal?
A deal to rid the town of vampires.
I just spoke to Giuseppe Salvatore.
Mm-hmm.
The round-up happens tonight.
Good. Insist that they do a body count
before they set the church is set ablaze.
I will.
27 vampires.
Once the flames create chaos,
crawl to the exit under the choir loft.
I'll be there to set you free.
Make sure you're not followed.
I need everyone to believe that I perished in that fire.
You knew that they're going to burn the vampires in the church?
I practically lit the match.
They were your friends. They were your family.
You just sold them out?
Without blinking.
Mason.
Why don't you start us off.
Sure.
What? I apologize. I'm an animal.
So, Mason, you and Jenna never dated?
She was always lost in Logan Fell-land.
Oh, my first mistake.
Mason was a catch.
He had girls lining up.
Really?!
Huh. I pegged you for a lone wolf.
I'm sure I wasn't half the lady killer you were.
How about a toast?
To new friends.
Cheers!
Would I be the worst friend
in the world if I abandoned you and went to Stefan's?
You want to leave?
It's just that he hasn't gotten back to me.
And I'm starting to get this bad feeling.
I don't think that's a good idea, Elena.
Damon's got it under control here.
Take it from me, there's nothing worse than a clingy girlfriend.
I'm not being clingy. I'm just concerned.
You understand, right?
How about I drive you?
Yeah. Ok. That'd be great. Thanks.
Yeah.
What did George get in return for giving you your freedom?
Something he wanted desperately.
So you sent 26 of your friends
to their death just to fake your own?
No. You were running from something. What was it?
Everyone has a past, Stefan.
Mine needed to stay far, far away.
But thanks to you, my plan nearly failed
before it even began.
Once George told me that the roundup was imminent,
I made sure I could see you one last time.
Vervain!
What?
But your father used your love for me against you.
Katherine!
He poisoned your blood.
We don't have long.
Then Damon, being Damon,
nearly ruined everything.
No!
We came for you. We tried to save you.
I didn't want to be saved.
Then Damon and I died for nothing. For nothing!
No, Stefan. You died for love!
Jenna just brought out "Guitar hero."
It might be time to mutiny.
Well, I just I happen to like "Guitar hero."
So you, my friend, are barking up the wrong tree.
Ok, enough with the innuendos.
You win. You're hilarious.
Thank you.
Come on, man,
you don't think I know what this barbecue is about?
How do you know about me?
Your brother was completely clueless.
It doesn't matter. I'm not your enemy, Damon.
You tried to kill my brother.
That was a mistake.
Really?
There was confusion.
I couldn't chain myself up in time.
I have no control once I shift.
What, no obedience school?
I'm serious.
Let's not spark some age-old feud that doesn't apply to us.
You expect me to believe that
you're in Mystic Falls planting peace trees?
I lost my brother.
My nephew lost his father.
I'm here for my family.
Let's be above this.
Thanks for this. I appreciate it.
Here we come... to the rescue.
Why are you being so snippy?
That's my own drama.
I'm sure that you two will beat the odds.
Not that there's any study to pull odds from.
What is the ratio of success for vampire/human couplings?
I'm guessing nil.
Ok, Caroline.
Sorry.
I love this song.
What's playing?
Playing We Radiate Goldfrapp.
Oh... Crap.
No takers for more drinks at the grill?
It's like I'm with a bunch of adults here.
I prefer the term role model.
Ok. Well, thanks for having me. It was awesome.
Alaric, catch that game next week?
Yeah. Looking forward to it.
Hey, you know, I should probably head out, too.
Jenna...
You are a wonderful hostess.
And you are a terrible artist.
Is that the only thing that makes me terrible?
Still deciding.
Good enough for me.
Alaric...
Let's not catch that game next week.
Are you sure the tow's coming?
We've been waiting forever.
I know. It's weird.
They said they'd be here by now.
Yeah.
I'm just gonna call Jenna.
No!
Let me try the tow people again.
And I'll use my aggro voice.
We can just walk from here.
I can't just leave my car.
We'll come back for it.
Just give me a minute, Elena.
Caroline, what part of
"I'm worried about Stefan" didn't sink in?
What's the rush?
Why are you hurrying to get to a relationship that'll never work?
Ok. Look, I know that you're upset over Matt,
But will you stop projecting it onto me and Stefan, please?
I'm not projecting anything.
You're human. He's a vampire.
You're going to be 70 and in diapers,
And he's still gonna be smoking hot.
And you will never have his children, Elena.
And you are too maternal to not have children.
Where is this coming from?
I'm just trying to be your friend.
Ok. Well, do me a favor and stop trying.
There's the tow. I'm gonna walk.
No. Elena, don't--
Aah. Caroline, you're hurting me.
Don't leave me alone.
What's wrong with you?
Hey there. Someone call about a flat tire?
She did.
Damon.
What? More dog jokes?
Nah. Those got old.
You know...
I think it was werewolves
who started this whole silver myth.
Probably for moments like this.
Duly noted.
I was really looking forward to last call.
Now you made an enemy.
So you going to tell me why you came back here?
Or were you just playing another game?
Have you not heard a word that I've said?
I've answered that question 5 times over now.
All right. Good. Make it six.
I want what I want, Stefan.
And I don't care what I have to do to get it.
My list of victims is a long one.
And I have no problem adding one more name to that list.
Come on, Katherine.
If you wanted Elena dead,
You would have done it by now.
I still can.
If I have to,
I will snap her neck like a twig.
And you know it.
Guess you don't hate me as much as you thought you did.
I don't want you seeing Elena anymore.
If you don't remove her from your life,
I will kill everyone that she loves while she watches,
And then I will kill her while you watch.
Don't you ever think for one moment that I will not kill you.
I have been sipping vervain
every single day for the last 145 years.
You caught me by surprise once,
I wasn't going to let it happen again.
It doesn't hurt me, Stefan.
What--why--
I told you.
I've missed you, Stefan.
I just wanted to spend some time with you.
Hello?
Stefan?
Stefan?
You must be Elena.
How is this possible?
How do we look exactly alike?
You're asking the wrong questions.
Elena.
Are you ok?
Not really.
Are you ok?
Not really.
Katherine.
Care to share how you
couldn't follow through with one simple task?
I tried, ok?
But I couldn't exactly kidnap my best friend.
Occupy her. That's all I asked.
I told her that her relationship was doomed.
And all that mortality stuff.
I think I--I--
I really think that I got to her.
I hope so.
Because let's not forget. I already killed you once.
I can easily do it again.
How was that barbecue?
Not great. You still pissed?
You still keeping secrets?
Yep.
Then I'm still pissed.
Hey, you know, I was thinking
about that stone you're looking for.
I might know a couple places it could be.
Do you think this is a joke?
If you know where it is then tell me.
Tell me how the curse is triggered.
If I tell you, you won't be able to think about anything else.
I don't want that for you.
I think I can handle knowing.
Yeah. You think you can handle it, tough guy?
You have no idea!
Do you want your stupid rock or not?!
Tell me where it is.
Tell me what triggers the curse!
You have to kill somebody!
Human blood!
You take a person's life away from them,
Then the curse is yours forever.
Can you handle that?
Elena.
Oh my god, I am so sorry about earlier today.
I don't--I don't know what came over me.
It's ok, Caroline.
Everything that you were saying was right.
It's just hard for me to hear, you know?
So you're not mad at me?
You were just being a good friend...in your own way.
My own head-case,
horrible way.
Elena, I really am sorry.
I'm starving.
Well, spending a day with your jealous ex
will do that to you.
Listen, I know you're upset.
All right, but...
we have to take her seriously.
Today was all about the lengths that she'll go to.
If she was going to hurt me, she would have.
I was standing right in front of her.
Elena, you caught her off guard.
It doesn't mean that you're safe.
I'm not afraid of her.
Well, you should be.
If Katherine had her way,
we'd be breaking up right now.
And if today taught me anything,
it's that Katherine's used to getting her way.
You're not actually saying that we should do what she says.
Listen, she's sadistic.
Ok. She threatened you.
She threatened everyone.
Yeah. No. I get it, ok. She's dangerous.
But every day that we're together. It's dangerous.
Why are you giving her so much power
over our relationship?
This is the reality of our situation.
Reality sucks.
This is what she wants, Stefan.
She wants us to fight.
She wants get between us.
She already has, Elena.
Bad day?
Bad century.
I heard you were on the loose.
What's the matter? Jealous I spent the day with Stefan?
I don't do jealous. Not with you.
Not anymore.
Then why so pouty?
I tried to kill a werewolf and failed.
Now I feel like I'm not living up to my best self.
Well, werewolves aren't easy prey.
What do you know about werewolves?
Why don't you ask your brother?
Don't try to be the hero, Damon. You'll end up dead.
Been there, done that.
At least this time it will have been worth it.
You ok?
I hated that fight.
I know, me, too. It felt too real.
Did you see Caroline?
Yeah.
We were right. Katherine got to her.
She was hanging on to every single word.
Then it won't be long before Katherine gets a play-by-play.
I wish I was wrong,
but I know Caroline too well.
It was so obvious that something was up today.
You're not wrong. It's pure Katherine.
She's always finding somebody to do her dirty work.
I think Damon was listening to us fight, too.
Are you gonna tell him that it wasn't real?
The only way Katherine's gonna believe it
is if everybody believes it.
It's the best way to make her think she's getting what she wants.
All this...
just to get you back.
That's not why she's here. Ok?
No matter what she says.
I know her.
Katherine doesn't care about anybody but herself.
She never has.
She's incapable of love.
She's here for another reason.
George.
Your carriage is waiting.
Well done, George. Thank you.
Now on to your part of the deal.
If anyone learns of my escape,
I will find you. And I will kill you.
Don't think that I won't.
We shall take each other's secrets to our grave.
Now you must hurry.
I love you, Stefan.
We will be together again.
I promise.
