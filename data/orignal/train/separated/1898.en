Let's say you're standing in an O.R.,
staring at an aneurysm
that's embedded deep in the patient's frontal lobe.
There are three things you'll need to remove it.
Zola's up.
No, she's still asleep. We're good.
No, no. She's up.
Did you hear something?
No.
But you know she's up?
Yes.
You'll need confidence...
You'll need an 11-blade...
And some really good instincts.
Come here, you.
No, no.
Okay, so then we coax those initial cartilage cells
to multiply--
Don't look at your cards.
So...
Then we coax those initial cartilage cells to multiply.
After 2 months, the--the, uh, original 200,000
have...
Now I've lost my place.
Relax.
No, I can't relax, okay?
I have to do this speech at the TED conference
in less than 48 hours.
The TED conference.
Um, do that thing where you picture
everyone in the audience naked.
That helps.
I'm just--I'm gonna start from the top, okay?
Articular cartilage.
Articular cartilage regeneration
offers new hope for patients...
What are you doing?
I'm, um... helping.
Good morning.
Oh, I'd say so.
Gas tanker slammed into an S.U.V. on the I-5.
Caused a huge pileup.
No telling how many traumas are coming in. We should...
Get going.
Hey. Did a giant tanker really flip over?
Where's Wilson?
With Grey. You've got me today.
So how big was the accident?
Do you think anyone got impaled? I...
Wilson! Stop sucking face and check your pager.
I can't believe I didn't hear my pager.
Yeah. It's hard to hear when you have a tongue in your ear.
Dr. Wilson.
Right?
Um, you saw us the other night.
I'm Casey Hedges. That my son Parker.
Right. Is he still sick?
Well, his fever was down when I left for my shift.
I'm a waitress. But then my neighbor called.
She said it spiked again, and then when I got home,
he had this rash.
You've been giving him the meds, lots of fluids?
Yeah, but his fever's still above 103,
and it's been like that for over a week now.
And I mean, I know that you told me it's a virus--
Probably adenovirus.
The fever can last at least five days with it.
It's not that unusual.
I-I've been tracking the spikes in his fever,
And I--
I looked up his symptoms online
and wrote down a bunch of stuff.
Roseola, shingles, lupus.
I just...
I can't explain it, but I know my kid.
This is not a virus. I just... feel it.
Come on.
Okay. I'll go get your chart.
Shepherd, what are you doing?
I got your page. A tanker blew?
A tanker didn't blow.
I meant, what are you doing with Ross?
Didn't you get the memo?
Oh, we're supposed to read those?
Yeah, I need you to start using other interns.
I can't have attendings playing favorites.
These kids need a well-rounded education.
Ross, are you feeling poorly rounded?
No, sir. I'm very rounded.
See? He's very rounded.
Hey. I heard about the accident. A tanker blew?
A tanker didn't blow.
Bailey, I haven't seen you
outside your genome lab for a week.
Oh, speaking of which, when can I have my genome mapped?
I have an aunt who died of breast cancer.
It can happen in males.
Uh, no. Yeah, it can.
It's just, now I'm thinking about your breasts.
When did you say that tanker blew?
The tanker did not blow.
Oh. Wh--
Don't look so disappointed.
Cam Miller, restrained passenger
in a vehicle t-boned on its side.
Vital signs stable. G.C.S. Is 14.
He's been disoriented.
Yeah, the tanker's been leaking gas
all over the road.
We did a primary decontamination on scene,
but we had to get him outta there.
Okay, no open flames,
No smokers, no use of cauteries.
Be safe, people.
Rachel Dawson, 42.
Restrained passenger in a car with front-end damage.
Closed head injury.
B.P. 110 over 70. Pulse 95.
Where's my son? Who has Ethan?
Does my husband have Ethan?
I told her they're right behind us.
Rachel!
Rachel, I'm here.
Paul Dawson, 45. Restrained driver
with major intrusion into his area of the vehicle.
Bruises to the chest.
B.P. 90 over 60. Pulse, 120.
Where's my son? Where's Ethan?
He's--he's on his way. Don't worry.
Ethan Dawson, 10 years old. Restrained in the backseat.
No obvious injuries except for a minor wrist lac.
He was walking around at the scene.
Ethan, my name is Dr. Hunt.
Are my mom and dad dead?
No, no. They're right inside.
You'll see them soon. I got you. Okay?
Okay.
Okay, let's go.
They said it could be cat scratch fever
or Stevens-Johnson syndrome--
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Who said this?
One of those medical sites online.
It's strep. Casey, Parker's rapid test
came back positive for strep throat.
I have a prescription for amoxicillin.
Oh, god. Thank god. I just knew it wasn't a virus.
As soon as we get you signed out,
you can take parker home.
Thank you.
Well, I hope your son feels better.
Where's my sweatshirt.
I want to step outside for a smoke.
Yeah, sure, if you want to die.
Sweetie, I don't need a lecture from you--
She means you're covered in gasoline, sweetie.
Now sit your butt back down.
Well, if he checks out, let's make room, okay?
We need the space.
This little guy checks out okay.
Okay. Um, finish bandaging his wrist,
and then have somebody wait with him--
But... I thought you said I could see my parents.
So, Mr. Dawson, there's a little fluid around your lungs.
I'm a little concerned, so we're gonna take you up to C.T.
Widened mediastinum.
I'm betting his aorta is shredded beef.
This is the patient's son.
Oh, sorry.
Uh, we gotta take him up to C.T.
Dad.
Ethan. Hey, I'm okay.
I-I'm gonna be fine.
Stay with mom. Stay with mom, all right?
Where is my mom?
Let's go find out, okay?
Now look right there. "R.D."
See? That's your mom.
Now it says that they are taking her up
to get some pictures taken.
And Dr. Murphy here will let you know
when you can see her, okay?
Call social services.
Kepner, how are we doing?
Take a look.
From ambulance arrival,
the entire intake took 22 minutes, 11 seconds.
Your new E.R. Works.
Just like it's supposed to.
What the hell was that?!
The tanker must have blown.
Hey, listen, it was just a big explosion.
And it was really far away, and everybody's fine, okay?
Everybody is safe, all right?
All right.
Fire!
Get him on the ground!
Over here! Put it out!
I guess he went out for that smoke.
Call the burn unit. We're gonna need a gurney.
"Can't Fight This Feeling"
We need another ... IV.
Right away.
I got your page. Is this--
The human fireball.
Yeah, let's get him to the burn unit right away.
Okay, let's roll.
Outta the way. Clear the way.
Everybody, listen up.
We're gonna be receiving more patients.
So buckle up. This is gonna be a long day.
Elyse Cruse, 37 weeks pregnant,
Hypotensive in the field, with abdominal bruising
and second-degree burns on her right arm.
Page O.B.
Right away.
I'm Dr. Kepner. Can you tell me your name?
My name's Elyse. Elyse Cruse.
Okay, Elyse-
But I don't care about me.
Please just do whatever you can to save my baby.
Just save my little girl.
How about I save you both?
Yeah, that would be great.
Okay.
Could you call my husband?
Okay, I don't want you to worry. It's gonna be okay.
Are you okay?
And what about my son?
We'll get an update on your family soon, Rachel.
What's the word?
Good news is, the kid's fine.
It's just a little cut that Murphy cleaned up.
Bad news is, Yang has the husband in surgery.
Possibly an aortic transection.
Speaking of bad news.
Ugh. Right frontal lobe hemorrhage.
That could be why she was anxiety.
Oh, cool, is it a epidural hemorrhage?
Sorry. I'm interrupting.
You guys were having a moment or something.
What do you want, Brooks?
Well, chief Hunt says I need to learn brainy things.
So I'm with you guys today.
Abdominal tenderness to palpation.
Damn it. She's having decels.
Her B.P. Is dropping.
Okay, Elyse, stay with me. Okay?
Just try to stay with me.
Is my baby okay?
We're gonna roll you on your side right now, okay?
You can't hear my baby's heart?
Try not to worry. Page O.B. Again.
Right now.
Ugh. Come on. Come on.
Where's O.B.? What's happening?
Kepner, she's bleeding.
What?
Cord's prolapsed. We need to secure it.
What is happening?
Your baby's umbilical cord has dropped,
and it's now trapped against her body,
and that's why she's in distress.
Ma'am, we need to keep the cord inside
so your baby doesn't lose any more oxygen.
To do that, I'm gonna have to place my hand inside.
I'm really sorry, but it's gonna hurt a lot, okay?
Did you call my husband? Where is my husband?
I did. I called him. Hold my hand.
Okay.
Okay?
Okay.
We need to get this baby out. All right, where's O.B.?
Tell them to meet us in the O.R. Now!
Right away.
Elyse, we're going to surgery right now
to take care of you and your baby.
Okay?
Matthew?
Matthew?
Oh, hi.
Yeah, superman here broke protocol
and ran into the crash to shield a kid from the blast
with his own body.
Well, it seemed like the right thing to do at the time.
He could've died.
Yeah, but I didn't. I'm fi--ow.
I'm fine.
Just go ahead and go.
You got more important patients than me.
Go save a life or something.
Yeah, go ahead. I'll--I'll check him out.
Okay. Um, I-I will be back as soon as I can.
Just--just don't go crazy
and go into shock or bleed out or something--
April, I'm fine.
I'll see you soon.
Please don't be surgical. Please don't be surgical.
Okay, I'm on it.
Oh, it's surgical.
Hey, there you are.
Oh, no. Me first.
Okay, okay. What have we got? What have we got?
Yeah, a bike messenger caught in the blast.
My patient's in a lot of pain.
Everybody's patient's in a lot of pain.
Yeah, these are all gonna need surgery.
Page Dr. Garrity.
My plane leaves for--
for TED in four hours.
You're going to TED?
Lucky. My roommate went last year.
Did tequila shots with Bill Gates.
It's a fancy people frat party.
Oh, you'll be singing a different tune next year
when you're there with your genome stuff.
Oh, map my genomes.
That sounds like fun.
It's not a spa treatment. It's science.
Just like building new cartilage
as I say in my speech--
Okay, Callie. Callie. The patients.
No, you're right.
I should keep it fresh for the conference anyway.
Excuse me.
Uh, just looking for a status report
for the patient's kid.
The injury extends into the aortic arch.
So in order to maintain head perfusion,
I have to bypass in two circuits.
I'm just waiting on Russell for a second opinion.
You had to call Russell for this?
Not really.
But ever since I became his boss,
I like to make him think that he's still mine.
3-0 prolene.
So could I give the kid a time frame?
Uh, give me an hour. I'll know better.
Okay.
Dr. Shepherd, where did you get
"It's a beautiful day to save lives"?
Is that from a movie?
No, it's not from a movie.
Are you sure?
'Cause sometimes I think I'm making something up,
and then I'm watching a detergent commercial,
and I realize, that's where I got that from.
Brooks, you know how sometimes
people downplay the difficulty of a task
by saying, "It's not brain surgery"?
Sure.
This is brain surgery.
Right.
Sorry.
What are you doing?
He makes me nervous,
and I just want him to like me.
Clearly not the way to do it.
Okay, Ross, now I have exposed the dura,
So why don't you come closer and get a better look?
He loves you.
I'd been in 20 surgeries
before he ever invited me to his side of the table.
It could take a while, but he'll warm up to you.
You've got some fast hands, Brooks.
And the baby's out.
I noticed you haven't thanked me yet
for catching your patient's prolapsed cord.
I was on my way to the E.R.
Yeah, taking your own sweet time.
You want to cool it, man?
You're being very unprofessional.
Okay, let's begin to explore the abdomen.
Oh, god, Elyse. She's losing too much blood.
More lap pads. Now!
Burn center is full.
I just closed us to new patients. What else?
Social services came for the little boy--
Ethan! No!
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Where you going?
I want to see my parents.
Sorry. He's a runner.
Honey, we need to go.
No, I don't want to.
You need sleep.
No, I'm not going anywhere!
Yes, you are. You're coming with me. Now come.
No. Look, he's worried about his parents.
How about we set you up in a room,
and you can stay with him there?
That's not a permanent solution.
I know, but it's--it's-- it's for one night.
And then we can figure out the rest later.
How does that sound?
Yeah? Sound good?
Okay.
Come on. We need to go now.
The baby's dad just arrived.
Myers is bringing him up.
I still don't know what she sees in that d-bag.
Right? What does she see in that guy?
He's so handsome
and friendly,
Charming, nice.
Vince, this is Dr. Karev.
He's been taking care of your little girl.
Look at her. She--she's perfect.
She's doing really well. And I spoke to Dr. Kepner.
Your wife is still in surgery. We should have an update soon.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Your baby's pretty darn cute.
Want to hold her?
Also sensitive.
Did I mention, he's sensitive?
We went home, but then his fever got higher.
It doesn't make sense.
Ma'am, we'll be with you as soon as we can.
We're extremely backed up.
Yeah, I understand everyone's very sick,
but so is my son.
Casey, what's wrong? What are you doing back here?
This isn't strep.
Whatever you prescribed him did nothing.
It takes at least 24 hours for antibiotics to start working.
Yeah, but then he should be getting better,
and he's getting worse.
This isn't strep.
Please just calm down.
Calm down? Calm down? My son is sick.
He's sick, and you gave him medicine,
and it's not working.
And now you just keep dismissing us,
just like all the other doctors did
at Seattle Pres and Urgent Care--
Wait. Hang on.
You've been to both of those places, too, this week?
Yeah, and I'm not gonna let you push me around like they did.
You either don't care about my son
or you don't believe me.
Either way, you suck, and I want someone else.
Find me another doctor!
Keep an eye on Rachel's I.C.P.
Update me with any changes.
Will do. Anything else?
Yes, Brooks, think fast.
Anything else medically?
A neuro exam every two hours.
Contact me immediately if there's any sign
of herniation or a new hemorrhage.
You got it?
Yes, sir.
Good.
Dr. Shepherd, I'm open.
That was my phone.
I'm sorry you have to stand there for so long,
dealing with my ass.
Ah, it's fine. I'm a plastic surgeon.
It's not that a big deal to me.
Actually, can we not talk while you do that?
Sure. I feel for you, dude.
But I have seen way worse.
Okay. I'm gonna come back later.
April--
It's cool. I'm, uh, I'm just gonna--
I'm gonna leave now. Yep. Now.
Like that.
That was worse.
He's cranky, he's not sleeping well,
and then he's got these really chapped lips,
and then today it was this weird rash.
A-and--and how-- how are you doing?
Are you getting enough sleep?
No, of course not. I told you, he's up all night.
And it's just you, no husband,
no boyfriend, or partner?
It's just me.
Well, that's a lot of pressure on you.
Are you a psychiatrist?
Casey,
Just listen--
Oh, my god. You are.
You think I'm crazy.
You think I-I skip work
and I drag my kid to the E.R. because it's fun,
Because--because I enjoy this?
My son is sick, okay? He is sick.
He used to wake me up every morning at dawn
by jumping on my bed.
Now I can barely get him up.
He does this thing before school--
I let him run out and get the newspaper--
It's his big-kid chore. He loves it.
He hasn't done it in a week and a half.
I show him cartoons, and he doesn't care.
I try to get him to eat...
I mean, I even gave him potato chips for breakfast once,
and... nothing.
I know...
that I am not a doctor, but you have to believe me.
You have to. You have to.
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.
I believe you.
We're gonna take care of your son.
Admit him.
I believe you.
Yes, I alerted security.
Of course. I looked all over.
Where's Ethan?
Hang on. I don't know.
I went to the restroom. When I came back, he was gone.
When?
I told you, he's a runner.
When did you lose him?
About a half-hour ago.
No, Shepherd still hates me.
Now he just makes me do tricks.
It takes more than just good instincts with Shepherd.
You have to be prepared, diligent--
Says his star pupil. I'm his circus act.
Wait.
Mom.
Hang on, buddy.
Mom.
What are you doing?
Who are you? What-- what are you doing?
Why don't we go outside, okay?
It's me, mom. Ethan.
It's okay, ma'am. It's your son.
No, it's not. Who is he? Who is that?!
Who are you?!
Help me! What's happening?!
Who is this? What's happening to me?
Help me! Help me, please!
So you're in the semifinals, huh?
What position do you play?
Coach stuck me at left defender.
Hey, left defender... is crucial.
I guess.
So...
Why doesn't she know who I am?
Ethan, your mom hurt her head pretty bad.
And sometimes that can make people act really weird,
even with the people that they love.
So she's gonna remember me?
I think so.
E-ethan, I, um...
I need you to stay with the social worker.
The lady?
Mm-hmm.
Can I stay with you?
No, no. No, I have to--I have to work.
I have to help your mom and dad get better,
and they're--they're gonna get better quicker
if they know that you're somewhere safe.
So can you help me out with that?
You done?
And I'm telling you...
The guys bring the ball down the wings,
left defender can save the game.
She has a new hematoma in the temporal lobe.
Now why would that cause her not to recognize her son?
Uh, the hematoma could be putting pressure
on the white matter tracts,
causing her to experience symptoms of capgras syndrome.
Good. And what would your plan of action be?
Relieve the pressure with evacuation of the hematoma.
What about watching her coags
and correcting her I.C.P. with mannitol
and aggressive I.C.P. drainage?
That's a good thought, Brooks,
but in this case, I think Ross is right.
Uh, find an O.R. that's available. Okay?
Oh, Brooks.
You never miss, do you?
Star pupil.
Circus act.
His CAT scan is completely normal.
I know this must be so annoying for you.
I mean, I know I know nothing,
but I did all this research--
No, not at all. Let's go through it.
Please. Um...
What's first?
Okay, are you sure that it's not lupus?
He doesn't fit the criteria,
and the rash is quite different.
What else?
What about, uh, ent-enterovirus
or, um, meningitis?
Well, I can see why you would think that.
But again, the rash associated with enterovirus
is commonly distributed over the hands and the feet.
And, uh, we ruled out meningitis
when his spinal tap came back clear.
Okay. Um...
I read this one article about something called Kawasaki disease.
They said it can cause a heart attack.
That's a good one.
It would explain the fever and the rash.
But there would be other symptoms--
the strawberry tongue,
and peeling skin and red eyes,
and--and no positive strep.
Dr. Grey... what do you think this is?
I-I think it's strep.
Yeah, but then he would be getting better.
I'm sorry. I know that you're a surgeon.
You don't even normally handle cases like this.
No, it's, uh...
I own the hospital, and I can do whatever I want.
I want to do some more tests.
You and me, Elyse, we're a team.
Ever since Professor Sheldon
paired us up in that stupid Poli-sci class.
I don't work without you.
So you can't leave me or us.
We're supposed to be together.
Elyse likes the name Rose for the baby.
What do you think?
I think it's beautiful.
Okay, honey.
Rosie it is.
I'm gonna go down and see her.
I love you.
I'm just gonna check on her burns.
How's she doing?
Not well.
She's acidotic, and her creatinine's sky-high.
You know, they dated in college.
But then her dad died,
so she had to leave school, and they lost touch
till about three years ago,
when they both randomly decided to move
from Wisconsin to Seattle
and joined the same bowling league.
How weird is that?
That people join bowling leagues?
The universe kept pulling them together, just...
waiting for them to see that they were meant to be together,
and then...
And then a tanker explodes,
and she ends up in the hospital.
Yeah.
Your paramedic is gonna be fine, by the way.
Ooh, Bailey.
You have to map me.
I need to know which parent I take after.
My dad eats three salads a day and has high cholesterol.
My mother, bunions.
If Torres gets mapped, I get mapped.
Hey, my genome sequencer is not a toy.
It is an expensive and complex piece of equipment,
to be used for people with serious conditions.
Oh, like this guy?
'Cause you should really map his genome,
look for the idiot gene.
He managed to snap his elbow
after lighting himself on fire
when he wanted a smoke while covered in gasoline.
Callie, I asked for an ortho consult,
and they sent me to you.
Weren't you supposed to leave hours ago?
I was, but then... baked Alaska.
I'm so sorry.
Well, hey, look at it this way.
Now you have time to spice up your speech for next year.
And I still need an ortho consult
in O.R. three when you're done.
Spice-- spice up?
No, I didn't say that.
Uh... you did, though.
No, no. I'm just saying that these--
these talks are never about
what they're... about.
I-I heard one about floating algae pods,
and then it ended up reminding me
to live every day to the fullest.
It was very inspiring.
Yeah. Yeah, and yours is just about, you know...
cartilage right now.
But no one sells cartilage like you.
And it is-- it's a great speech.
You know, this invitation
was the one uncomplicated good thing
that's happened in a while,
the one thing I was really looking forward to.
Yeah, and I'm telling you that it's great.
No. You're telling me it's not...
Finally.
And it helps.
I feel better about not going.
I'll see you in O.R. three.
So any idea when the kid's dad
is gonna get transferred out of the C.C.U.?
He's pretty freaked out right now.
No, no idea.
He's stable, but his hemoglobin is still low.
That aortic repair took a lot longer than I thought.
Oh, I have to be back on rounds...
in 29 minutes.
Should I sleep or should I shower?
I could sleep in the shower.
Oh, but I'm also starving. Have you eaten?
Shoot.
His pressure dropped out and he went into cardiac arrest.
Hold C.P.R.
Pulse is v-tach. Paddles. Charge to 200.
What happened?
I was doing my exam,
and she started bleeding from her incisions and her I.V. sites,
and then she dropped into v-fib.
We just shocked her once.
I'll take over. Charge to 150.
Push another Epi.
Clear.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Come on. Give me 200.
Clear!
Got him. Got him.
Clear!
Come on, Elyse!
Push 5 of Epi.
April.
Epi now!
April, we lost her.
Okay?
I don't know why this one
is hitting me so hard.
It's not supposed to happen this way.
It's...
It's not right.
I can't tell him. I can't tell him.
I, uh, and I can't make him feel worse
just 'cause I feel bad.
I--I'll do it.
No, no.
I'll do it. I can do it.
I just...
I need a minute.
Okay.
I was, uh, coming to give the mom an update on her baby--
Elyse Cruse.
Yeah, she didn't, um... she didn't make it.
We were gonna go tell the husband now.
No, I was. I was. I-I will.
I just--I need...
I just have to pull myself together.
Chest Peckwell's name's on the file.
You want me to make him do it?
More ice.
Could it be munchausen by proxy?
What, that she's making her own kid sick?
No. She just has a strong feeling
that it's something more than strep.
Or she's crazy.
What's his core temp?
Still 93.
I mean, it's strep, right?
If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck--
Mer, the duck's strep test positive.
What happened?
He had an M.L. He coded.
Why didn't you wake me?
Why would I? He's my patient?
So what are you doing?
Uh, therapeutic hypothermia, just 24 hours.
I'm cooling his body so he'll avoid another attack.
But--but he just had surgery.
This could increase his risk of infection and bleeding.
Or it could save his life.
Did Russell agree to this?
You know, I don't know. I didn't ask him.
'Cause he's my patient.
I think he's gonna tell your teacher.
Okay, Ross.
Open up the bone flap.
Yes, sir. You got it.
Good.
Okay. A little bit more.
Good.
Thank you, sir.
Brooks, why don't you step up
and help me excise the dura?
Really?
Yeah. Switch with Ross.
Okay, so when I cut, I want you to
coagulate the bleeders with the bipolar.
Exactly.
God, you have fast hands, Brooks.
I'm so sorry, Casey.
But I-I can't find anything wrong with Parker
other than the strep.
So you're gonna discharge him?
I can't find a reason to keep him here.
It's not surgical,
his labs keep coming back clean.
I know I keep saying this, and I know it's crazy.
I mean, I can hear myself sounding crazy...
But this feeling won't go away,
This feeling that there is something wrong with him.
And I know you're telling me
that there's nothing wrong with him
and that I should believe you because you're a doctor
and I'm just a waitress.
But how do I ignore this?
How do ignore my gut
telling me that there is
something seriously wrong with my son?
Hey, you seen super douche around?
Peckwell?
Jason?
Ah, conference room.
Myers.
Oh, Grey's paging me. I'll catch you later.
Vince Cruse's wife didn't make it.
I figure the news might come better from you.
I'm sorry. She's not my patient anymore.
I passed her off to Kepner.
Okay, but his wife was your patient when she first came in.
The guy knows you. He trusts you.
Dude, I'm sorry, but she is not my responsibility.
You're a douche.
No, you're a douche.
You don't have a problem with how I do my job.
You have a problem with who I'm dating.
You're really not coming with me to talk to him?
What do you think?
Guess I'll be doing your job again.
You paged me?
Oh, we're discharging Parker?
Yes, I have it all ready to go,
But I just need you to go through it with me all
one more time.
Okay.
Latest white count?
18.
Platelet count?
500,000.
High fever. Unresponsive to meds.
It's gotta just be a weird presentation of strep, right?
Actually, hang on. The labs were just updated.
Yesterday's rapid test was a false positive.
The strep culture's negative.
Who are you calling?
No one. I'm checking my calendar.
What day did his fever start?
Wednesday, I think.
Damn. We're already at day ten.
What's day ten?
Did Parker have red eyes?
Uh, he was asleep the last time I checked on him.
Let's go.
Oh. Is everything okay?
We need to check Parker's eyes.
What--what's going on? Y-you're scaring me.
Page peds, page cardio,
start an I.V.I.G. right away.
We're already on day ten.
What? What is happening?
Casey, if we're right,
this could be kawasaki disease.
But we need to get this I.V. started on Parker right away.
We're still within the window
to prevent permanent heart damage,
But we have to do it right now.
Oh, no.
No. No.
Casey, hey.
You okay?
So this is Parker's echo.
That right there is the fluid around his heart.
The I.V.I.G. will fix that.
He's gonna need another echo in six months.
And... do you remember this?
Parker has kawasaki disease.
You fought for your son.
You didn't give up.
You saved his life today.
You were right.
I was right?
You were right.
Dr. Shepherd,
I've run a full post-op exam on Rachel.
I'm gonna monitor her for the next four hours,
But don't worry.
I'll still be here early tomorrow morning
to prep for Mr. Yoshida's craniotomy.
Yeah, Ross, about that. Hunt's right.
Everybody needs a shot at neuro,
And you need a chance to see other specialties,
So Brooks is gonna be on my service
for the rest of the week.
I'll see you when it's your turn again.
Arizona, I just want to go home.
I just want to curl up in a ball, do...
What--what the hell? What is this?
Your TED speech.
Sit.
What? How? How?
I made a call.
We set up a video stream to the conference.
You're going on live.
Oh! I don't have my notes.
Oh, yes, yes. Yes, you do.
Even though I know you know it by heart.
I mean, I know it by heart. Just start talking.
Okay, it's almost time.
But--but I-- it's a terrible speech.
It's a great speech.
I'm not...
Five, four, three...
Coming to you live from Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital
in Seattle-- Dr. Calliope Torres.
Just talk. Just be who you are.
I'm Dr. Callie Torres.
And...
I've had a pretty bad year.
I was almost killed in a car wreck,
then I... nearly lost my wife in an accident
that claimed the life of my best friend
and the father of my child,
and... some other stuff.
I'm an orthopedic surgeon by trade
and I work with cartilage,
so I've spent a lot of time thinking about
what holds us together
when things fall apart.
I'm so sorry I haven't been to visit you more today.
Are you okay?
Do you...
Do you believe that God plans
for two people to be together?
Yeah, I do.
My patient died,
her husband is left with their new baby.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
It just-- it doesn't--
it doesn't make any sense.
Why would he bring these two people together,
make them fall in love, o-open up to one another,
make them feel like they were meant to be together,
and then just... pull them apart?
April...
I get it.
I-I know today scared you, but I'm here.
I'm... i'm fine.
I promise you, I'm not going anywhere.
And I love you, too.
Come here.
I talked to Russell,
and he agrees with your course of hypothermia,
although he may only be agreeing
because he's afraid of you.
Like you said...
you're his boss now.
Yeah, what's going on?
This guy has a little boy, Cristina,
who is scared to death that both of his parents--
Oh, my God. A little boy? Why didn't you say that?
I would've rethought everything.
I would've actually tried to save the man.
Cristina--
Do you think that I would make a decision
that is not in the best interest of my patient?
I just want this kid to see his dad again.
I do, too.
I know.
I know.
It's been a hell of a day.
Yeah, let's get outta here.
Yeah. Um, I gotta wrap up a few things first.
Okay, sure.
There are some feelings that refuse to go away.
They're little distractions whispering in your ear.
Thank you for not being a douche.
You're welcome.
Where's Wilson?
Probably with Assface.
Beer, please.
You got it.
I know what you're doing,
and apparently you think I'm too nice
to do anything about it...
but you're wrong.
So you can try to snake neuro out from under me,
but just so we're clear,
I'm not going down without a fight.
I'm not--
Save it.
Some things just get under your skin.
So... she's sleeping?
She made it through the day, just like your dad.
They both have a lot of good doctors taking care of them.
And... I can see them tomorrow?
Yeah.
But right now--
right now we need to get you back to your room
so you can get some sleep, all right?
Hey, you know, I-I played some left defender myself.
So you played soccer?
Mm. I did.
Did you score any goals?
Look, mommy. I made this for you.
Buddy.
Try as you might...
Thank you.
You can't ignore your instincts.
Hi, Dr. Bailey.
What do you need, Grey?
Oh, genetically, I don't know anything about Zola.
And I want to be able to fight for my kid,
I want you to map her.
And if I'm gonna have to fight for her,
I am gonna need to know if I'm gonna be around to do it.
So I want you to map me, too.
I want to know if I'm gonna get Alzheimer's.
It's like they say...
