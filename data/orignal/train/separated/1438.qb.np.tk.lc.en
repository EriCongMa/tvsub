第三季 第一集
we &apos;re beginning our initial descent to jackson hole , wyoming .
thank you for flying united .
reckon we &apos;ll be landing soon .
phil , honey , you promised not till we got there .
okay .
this year we &apos;re going to a dude ranch .
with the whole family .
mm @-@ hmm the family .
what if dylan buys his own ticket ?
we &apos;ll sleeping in seperate cabins .
what if dylan and i share a horse ?
mm , i hate landing .
we &apos;ll get through this .
what are you doing ?
i want my ears to pop .
try putting a little rouge on &apos; em .
nobody gets me .
wow . isn &apos;t this beautiful , little cowgirl ?
you hate her sparkly outfit , don &apos;t you .
no , i told you , it &apos;s fine ,
i just didn &apos;t like you wearing a matching one .
so we haven &apos;t told the family yet ,
but we &apos;ve decided to adopt a baby boy .
from america this time .
you might say we &apos;re &quot; buying domestic . &quot;
in private . you might say that in private .
our adoption attorney told us it would be a good idea
to make a photo book to show prospective moms .
yes , but he thought that cam &apos;s version was a little too &quot; artsy , &quot;
so , we decided to take a few rugged shots at the ranch to ,
you know , balance it out .
i don &apos;t think it needs balancing out .
really ?
it &apos;s called &quot; production value . &quot;
horse .
look , jay ! so beautiful !
your ears haven &apos;t popped yet , huh ?
i &apos;m like the horse whisperer .
but something is taking this one skittish .
look at the mountains .
they &apos;re amazing .
i &apos;ve never been this far from home before

it just when you say , &quot; phil is my son @-@ in @-@ law , &quot;

i realized that if i was gonna raise a boy ,
i needed to butch up my life .
you know , i wanted to be able to teach my son
all the things that my dad taught claire .
hey , hollywood .
i don &apos;t love that .
wanna see something ?
oh , my gosh . is that a firecracker ?
shh !

i &apos;m not surprised .

i &apos;d rather see you get hit by one , but ...
ha . good one , gorgeous .
jay ! is this like the lobster ? !

because this one looks very tender .
look alive , old @-@ timer .
one of your calves is getting away .
hey , something &apos;s wrong with my horse . she &apos;s veering left .
when this happened , my uncle was at stroke .
oh there &apos;nothing wrong with buttercup ,
you just got to let her know who &apos;s the boss .
beautiful form , cactus flower !
beautiful !
you look like a dadgum conquistadora !
she &apos;s deaf , but i can hear ya .
why are you riding that way ?
i &apos;m afraid that cow over there might bite me .
oh , yes , he &apos;s gonna come up and bite you
because your leg looks so desirable with those--
are those canvas ?
okay , phil , ease that one back over towards me .

ease him back this way .
hey ! piece of cake , huh , jay ?

that &apos;s my nickname for your wife .
hilarious .
go , mom ! whoo !
yeah , mom ! you rock !
oh , i wish i had a rock .
hey . it wouldn &apos;t kill you to be nice to dylan .
it might .
but , honey , i don &apos;t know why you always stick up for him .
haley can do so much better .
because i know what it &apos;s like to fall for a girl
whose dad thinks i &apos;m not good enough .
all right , you &apos;re right .
i can make more of an effort .
that &apos;s the woman i love .
we taking a little break over here ? laying some pipe ?
no . sorry . i was just talking to bossy .
phil !
i &apos;m sorry .
jay , look ! i got this one !
i got this one !
she &apos;s veering left again .
when we get back , i &apos;m gonna see
if she can track a pencil with her eyes .
okay , lily , i &apos;m going to push you one more time .
now don &apos;t kick me , okay ?
aah ! oh ! lily !
i said don &apos;t kick me . okay ?
you know it &apos;s your own fault that &apos;s happening .
why don &apos;t you try standing behind her ?
you are an idiot .
oh , really ? i ain &apos;t the one getting kicked .
why are you following me ?
why are you fighting me here , gorgeous ?
this works .
i really , really don &apos;t appreciate
you calling me &quot; gorgeous . &quot;
i just want to enjoy time with my family ,
so if you don &apos;t mind--mm !
not a problem . see you around , sunshine .
you kissed a boy !
no , the boy kissed me . okay , lily ?
the boy kissed me .
* i rode a horse for the first time today *
* wasn &apos;t surprised when it went ... neigh *
hey , dylan .
hey , mrs. dunphy .
i was wondering if we could have a little chat .
oh . you want me to go home .
no , no . it &apos;s the--the opposite of that .
i want you to go home ?
no , i , um , i want you to know how glad i am that you &apos;re here .
really ?
&apos;cause sometimes i just get this vibe you don &apos;t like me .
oh . dylan , no . i &apos;m sorry .
i @-@ i like you .
i @-@ i like you a lot . i just ...
it &apos;s complicated because haley &apos;s my daughter .
whoa . whoa , whoa .
you are totally a hot mom , but i can &apos;t do this .
oh , my god . okay , we--there &apos;s--no , no .
i merely meant that i &apos;m sorry if i made you feel unwelcome .
whew ! that would have been awkward .
so awkward .
you know , but for the record , mrs. dunphy ...
yes ?
if haley wasn &apos;t my girlfriend ...
and mr . dunphy was out of the picture ...
i would be honored to share your bed
and raise luke , alex , and haley as my own .
okay .
good talk .
* she &apos;ll be running down the mountain *
* she &apos;ll be running down the mountain when she comes *
the song ended two minutes ago .
well , i &apos;ll tell you what , she could play evita .
really ? you notice the crickets left ?
anyone want more water ?
oh , dad , i &apos;ll take one .
heads up .
oh ! oh , my gosh .
oh . it was--it was dark . i @-@ i couldn &apos;t see it . thank you .
so did you set off the firecracker yet ?
when i do , you won &apos;t have to ask .
first , all the electronics will go out ,
then comes the heat flash .
afterwards , the living will envy the dead .
and yet i &apos;m the one on the no @-@ fly list .
you know what ? maybe next time i &apos;ll just catch it ,
and then hand it to you .
oh , okay . yeah , let &apos;s do that .
you--you do everything , and i &apos;ll do nothing .
something on your mind ?
this isn &apos;t the right place to talk about it .
okay .
i @-@ i &apos;m s--
i &apos;m not sure if we should have another baby .
what ? are you serious ?
i think that we might be rushing into this .
rushing into-- we &apos;ve been working--
everybody , it &apos;s me , dylan .
i just wanted to thank you all for bringing me on this trip ,
and making me feel like one of the family ,
especially bossy .
so i can &apos;t think of a better time
to ask something of the woman that i love .
okay .
no , no .
haley gwendolyn dunphy ,
will you do me the honors
of being my lawfully wedded--
no . no , no , no , no , no . no proposals .
not now . not gonna happen .
she &apos;s a child , so ...
mom !
you &apos;re still in high school !
i meant after she graduates .
not then . not now .
not ever .
seriously , what are you two gonna live off of ?
the--the--the royalties from the horsey song ?
put it back in your pocket .
would you stop it ?
no , i won &apos;t . i won &apos;t .
no , it &apos;s okay .
i guess i &apos;ll just turn in .
just so you know , there &apos;s a fan in my cabin
that sounds like someone crying .
dylan , wait ! i hate you !
oh , come on . haley , get back here !
phil , anything ?
i think you said it all , claire .
you want me to rope her ?
i can , you know .
for what it &apos;s worth ,
my second wife was in high school .
sweetie , here . here we go .
one , two , three .
one , two , three .
gone .
it &apos;s gone ! it &apos;s over there !
it &apos;s not back there .
we counted to three .
yes .
where have you been ?
i @-@ i slept on the couch in the lodge .
i know you didn &apos;t want to have a big fight last night .
well , i &apos;m ready now .
cam , i &apos;m sorry .
look , what if i can &apos;t do the father @-@ son stuff ?
the hunting , the--the sports ,
the three stooges ?
you know what happens in real life
when someone gets hit in the head with a ladder ,
they go to the hospital and they get an m.r.i.
never see that scene .
i think you &apos;re overthinking this .
you know , i love sports , i love the stooges .
we &apos;ve got this covered .
no . no , you--you got it covered ,
but i &apos;m just stuck on the sidelines ,
pretending to understand the rules , and ...
you know , my dad was a rough @-@ and @-@ tumble guy .
and i just-- i could never relate to him .
and i don &apos;t know . i just don &apos;t think i could handle
disappointing ... two generations .
i think you &apos;re more masculine
than you give yourself credit for .
who puts a birdhouse next to a porch ?
claire , i know that you &apos;re worried
that dylan is gonna break haley &apos;s heart ,
but i see in his eyes
that he &apos;s gonna stick with her forever .
no matter what , he &apos;s always going to be with her .
on your deathbed--
okay . all right . i can &apos;t take this anymore .
i &apos;m gonna go find her .
no . you push too hard , you chase her right into his arms .
you &apos;ll end up with a boob for a son @-@ in @-@ law .
believe me , you don &apos;t want that .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
what ?
hey , have you guys seen dylan ?
no . no . why ?
i &apos;m not talking to you .
he said he was going out for a walk last night ,
and no one &apos;s seen him since .
sweetheart , i &apos;m sure he &apos;s fine .
maybe after last night , he just went home .
doubt it . he left his luggage .
we have to do something .
if he doesn &apos;t eat five times a day , he gets spacey .
what would that even look like ?
we &apos;ll find him . hank ?
we got a situation here !
what seems to be the trouble ?
we need to talk .
what ?
you stole my first kiss .
what are you talkin &apos; about ?
i had it all planned out .
it was supposed to be special ,
someone with a high gpa and a bright future ,
not a mario brother .
fine . you know what ? i don &apos;t even want your kiss .
here , you can have it back .
there . now we &apos;re even .
well , keep it . i don &apos;t -- i don &apos;t want it anymore .
what am i doing ?
okay , people .
looks like we have a walker .
right now he is facing treacherous terrain ,
sudden drops , mountain lions ,
hungry bears , oh , and wolverines .
that is , if the hypothermia didn &apos;t already get him .
why did we come here again ?
so our best bet is to split up .
you two are gonna take the north hiking trail .
can i go with my dad instead ?
negative .
i need buffalo phil and old @-@ timer
to check the snake river .
buffalo phil --
worth the wait .
me and cactus flower will ride on up to destiny ridge .
maybe i should ride up there with her .
negatory . that trail is for advanced riders only .
we don &apos;t need another dead body .
&quot; another &quot; ?
let &apos;s go ! move &apos; em out .
phil , help me saddle my horse , will ya ?
well , look who &apos;s suddenly needed by his father @-@ in @-@ law .
phyllis .
phil --
is .
hey , uncle mitch . whatcha doing ?
oh , hey .
just -- just thinkin &apos; .
you know , i &apos;ve been meaning to tell you ,
you &apos;re a super fun uncle .
and i &apos;m saying this as a boy .
uncle cameron sent you over here , didn &apos;t he ?
what ? that &apos;s hilarious .
no , i love how you and me can joke like this .
okay , luke , look , i don &apos;t know how much cam told you ,
but i don &apos;t think this is a problem
that you can help me with . it &apos;s ...
okay , good . i &apos;ve got my own problem .
what ? what &apos;s that ?
can you keep a secret ?
i kept a pretty big one for 22 years , so ...
i &apos;ve got this new firecracker ,
and i can &apos;t decide what to blow up .
oh , luke , that &apos;s dangerous .
i know . that &apos;s what &apos;s fun about it .
i don &apos;t get boys .
what is so great about destroying things ?
it turns stuff into flying chunks of stuff .
okay , no . no , g @-@ give it to me . come on .
fine .
i take it back . you &apos;re not that fun .
all right , hey , look , um ,
we &apos;ll do it together , all right ?
you just made the best decision of your life .
damn it !
buttercup ! what the hell &apos;s wrong with this horse ?
jay .
i want to talk to you about
that son @-@ in @-@ law crack you made at breakfast .
oh , i didn &apos;t mean anything by that .
i think you did .
i get that i wasn &apos;t your first choice to marry claire ,
but it &apos;s been 18 years , and there hasn &apos;t been a day
when i wasn &apos;t a loyal husband to your daughter
and a great dad to your grandkids .
so if we &apos;ve still got a problem , now it &apos;s your problem .
phil , wait up .
let me ask you something , man to man .
okay .
you notice anything funny about the --
hank character and , uh ...
gloria ?
yeah , he &apos;s hitting on her . why ?
i knew it .
where are you going ?
destiny ridge .
buttercup , ha !
buttercup , hiya !
seriously ?
okay . okay , it &apos;s clear .
after this , we &apos;re gonna have some angry birds .
yeah .
it &apos;s gonna be &quot; bye bye birdie . &quot;
it &apos;s a big musical from the &apos; 60s .
no . forget it . what you said .
okay .
okay , go .
that &apos;s it ?
i &apos;m sorry , buddy .
i brought that thing all the way from ...
cam , i did a boy thing ! i blew up the birdhouse !
you should have seen it . it was so awesome .
that &apos;s great !
yeah . i think i can do this .
i mean , maybe not everything and maybe not right away ,
and not the three stooges ...
no .
i do . i want a son .
i &apos;m sorry i panicked .
oh , that &apos;s great .
now maybe we can go back to taking pictures for the book .
yes ! pictures of me blowing up stuff !
okay , i see we &apos;ve overcorrected .
i know you think i &apos;m the mean mom
who wouldn &apos;t let you marry your boyfriend ,
but someday you &apos;re gonna realize ,
i did what had to be done .
no , you didn &apos;t . i was never gonna marry dylan .
i told him no .
oh , you did ? thank god .
but it was my proposal to turn down .
you know , you keep telling me to act like an adult ,
but then you don &apos;t even give me a chance .
oh . you sort of got me there .
but , sweetheart , i don &apos;t expect you to understand this .
i certainly didn &apos;t when i was your age .
i look at you as my baby , and i always will .
it &apos;s just what moms do .
i &apos;m not a baby anymore !
okay ? and i am never gonna see dylan again !
dylan !
dylan !
what ? !
where are you ? !
wyoming !
you &apos;re okay !
i had the craziest night .
when you rejected me , i felt lost and scared .
and then i went out on a walk ,
and i felt a whole different kind of lost and scared .
and then i fell asleep in the stable .
and when i woke up , i met this woman named jake
who &apos;s strong like a man .
then we had this long talk , and he / she hired me .
uh , what do you mean , she hired you ?
i work here now .
so you &apos;re staying ?
yeah .
what about us ?
it could never work . we &apos;re from two different worlds .
you &apos;re a high school student ,
and i &apos;m a ranch hand .
i &apos;m just--i &apos;m so glad you &apos;re okay . i really am .
thanks . but we &apos;re not supposed to fraternize with the guests .
okay .
dylan !
dylan !
you got a voice like a meadowlark , don &apos;t ya ?
dylan !
yeah , i sure am worried about that kid .
dylan !
he ain &apos;t down there .
oh , come on now . you come up here for the cowboy experience .
you &apos;re looking at him .
do i look like the kind of woman that would cheat on her husband ?
yes .
really ?
hey ! i think you better move away from that woman .
only we touch our women when they don &apos;t want us to .
easy . easy there , friend .
i wasn &apos;t hitting on this filly .
this is all part of the package .
if i didn &apos;t play the bad guy ,
he wouldn &apos;t get to ride up and be the big hero .
he doesn &apos;t need you to make him a hero .
he &apos;s a hero every day .
why don &apos;t you do us all a favor ? get back on your horse ,
ride down to the lodge and tell &apos; em--
can you keep him still ?
i &apos;m trying to make a point .
i am .
okay . okay , i &apos;m gone .
ma &apos;am .
wait . wait .
there &apos;s something i wanna say to you .
i will only be checking &quot; somewhat satisfied &quot;
on our comment card .
jeez .
i mean , he was great with the kids .
i looked it up .
the distance between our houses is 2,443 miles .
yeah , but , you know , on some maps ,
it &apos;s like--pfft ! this big .
god , you &apos;re stupid .
all in all , it was a great vacation .
we may have lost a man ...
but out there on the range , under that great big sky ,
we found a part of ourselves we never knew was there ,
just like the horny cowboy said we would .
no .
