mr. scratch
look , there &apos;s been some kind of misunderstanding , all right ?
i &apos;m innocent !
i didn &apos;t--i--
i couldn &apos;t do this !
will someone please listen to me !
who are you ?
i &apos;m agent hotchner , mr. merrin .
have you been advised of your rights ?
yeah .
do you know where you are ?
some fbi place , right ?
you &apos;re at the behavioral analysis unit in quantico , virginia .
you know why you &apos;re here ?
because you think i &apos;m a killer .
are you a killer ?
no .
why won &apos;t anybody believe me ? i am not--
stop .
sit down .
take a deep breath .
i want you to tell me exactly what happened two nights ago .
don &apos;t leave anything out . can you do that ?
yeah . yeah , i can do that .
so , uh , me and ...
me and my wife tabitha ,
we were getting ready for bed and she says ...
i think i heard something ,
downstairs .
maybe outside .
again ?
it &apos;s--it &apos;s a dog or a cat or squirrel or something .
it &apos;s nothing .
go .
so i did .
i checked the front door and it was fine .
everything was fine .
until ...
until i--i smelled like ... sage .
sage ?
like burning sage .
&apos;cause that &apos;s when i ...
tabitha ? !
call 91--
a shadow monster ?
yeah .
with talons for hands ?
i know how it sounds .
i--i knew i needed to get upstairs ,
because ...
because i--i--
i could hear her screaming .
larry , no !
larry , please , stop !
no ! no ! larry , please !
no ! larry , no !
please don &apos;t ! larry , no !
stop , larry !
i passed out ,
and when i woke up , the cops had arrested me .
i didn &apos;t do it .
i swear to god , it is exactly what happened .
no , it &apos;s not .
yes , it is .
mr. merrin , what happened was you took a kitchen knife
and you stabbed your wife to death .
no , no .
neighbors heard the screaming and they called 911,
and when the police arrived , they found you still on the bed
holding the knife .
i didn &apos;t do that .
you &apos;ve been scratching yourself , mr. merrin .
are you aware of that ?
open your shirt and you will see why .
that &apos;s--that &apos;s from the shadow monster .
no , that &apos;s from your wife .
forensics matched your skin under her fingernails
as she fought to keep you from killing her .
think back to the words she was screaming .
larry , please , please , please ! larry !
larry ...
why would i do that ?
do you recognize either of these people ?
no , i--no .
this is daniel karras and this is christine mcneil .
each of them claims to have been attacked
in their homes by a shadowy figure .
when in reality , daniel stabbed his mother to death
and christine her boyfriend .
and like you , they have no recollection of the murders .
what does it mean ?
it means that someone found a way
to induce a psychotic break in the 3 of you .
why--why us ? why me ?
well , that &apos;s why you &apos;re here instead of a holding cell in topeka ,
so my team can answer that question .
agent hotchner .
i &apos;m not a murderer .
yes , you are .
and i &apos;m going to find out who turned you into one .
&quot; your memory is a monster .
&quot; it summons with will of its own .
you think you have a memory , but it has you . &quot;
john irving .
why don &apos;t we just start with the simplest explanation ?
they &apos;re lying .
there are easier lies to tell to cover for murder .
why tell the same one , especially when it doesn &apos;t make sense ?
could it be a group delusion ?
their similar age range all points in that direction ,
33 to 34 years old , but the geographic
diversity kind of rules that out .
yeah . larry merrin &apos;s from topeka .
christine mcneil is from roswell , georgia ,
daniel karras is from derry , maine ,
all different economic levels , social circles ,
obviously different racial backgrounds .
so if he &apos;s an unsub ,
he &apos;s not killing but creating killers .
murder by proxy , if you will .
it &apos;s gotta be drugs .
larry merrin &apos;s story just sounds like a bad trip .
according to the police reports ,
all 3 tox screens came up negative .
well , they only screen for known compounds .
this could be a cocktail we &apos;ve never seen before .
every drug affects every person differently ,
yet somehow this unsub is able to make his drug
affect 3 completely dissimilar people exactly in the same way .
maybe they &apos;re not dissimilar at all .
maybe the drugs are just the tipping point
and these 3 share some sort of pre @-@ existing mental condition
he knows he can tap into to induce them to kill .
we find that , we find him .
did she feel a lot of pain ?
did i kill her quickly ?
mr. karras , we want to get to the bottom of this , too .
so we &apos;d like to take you through a cognitive interview .
what &apos;s the point ?
it could help you remember details you couldn &apos;t before .
and those details could help us understand what happened .
so , please .
close your eyes .
and put yourself back in your home a week ago .
you got home from work early , right ?
right .
how did you feel when you walked through the door ?
happy .
hey , ma .
hey , ma , you home ?
she wasn &apos;t . and then i remembered
she said that she was going to the movies with some friends .
i thought my beer tasted funny .
and then i realized it wasn &apos;t my beer ,
that it was a smell that was coming from somewhere else .
what was the smell ?
sage .
you &apos;re sure about that ?
yeah . yeah , because once i placed it ,
i was out .
how long were you out ?
i don &apos;t know .
all i know is that when i came to ,
it was dark and i couldn &apos;t move .
help !
somebody help me !
help !
it did sexual things to me .
he had these--these-- these talons for hands , and ...
uh , i got--i got free and then i , um ...
and then i hid somewhere in the house ,
and , uh ...
next thing i remember ,
i was standing over my mom &apos;s body ...
and the cops were cuffing me .
i ...
so ... so , i--
maybe--maybe--you know , maybe the rape , you know , uh ...
maybe i snapped .
you know ? you know what i mean ?
maybe i snapped and , uh , i lashed out
at the first person that i saw .
mr. karras--
because this is the only way that it makes sense .
at your lawyer &apos;s insistence , the maine police
ran a rape kit on you .
there was no evidence of assault , sexual or otherwise .
ok , well , run another rape kit .
no rope burns on your arms or legs .
no evidence of a break @-@ in at all .
what you guys trying to tell me ,
that this didn &apos;t happen to me ? &apos; cause it did !
there are others .
excuse me ?
my lawyer said that there were others that this happened to .
that &apos;s right .
well , can i talk to them ?
no .
why not ?
christine ?
christine ?
can you just blink
if you understand what we &apos;re saying ?
georgia police say that she started to tell the story
of being attacked by a dark figure
and then stopped and started doing this .
can you blame her ?
sir . i &apos;m sorry , it &apos;s urgent .
no , it &apos;s all right .
do what you can .
yeah , sure . i &apos;ll just , uh ...
i did some digging .
all 3 of our victims were adopted
and all in 1985 . all of them .
from where ?
that &apos;s the thing . it &apos;s from different states ,
they were closed adoptions , it &apos;s pre @-@ internet .
i gotta go through the analog rabbit hole .
it &apos;ll take a while .
all right , rossi and reid just landed in topeka
to walk the crime scene , and i want you to reach out
to the family members and find out if there &apos;s any shared history
in the foster care system .
sir , yes , sir .
thank you .
no records or paperwork in the house
regarding larry merrin &apos;s adoption .
morgan struck out with the vics .
they knew they were adopted
but couldn &apos;t recall anything .
well , they were 3 to 4 years old at the time .
firm memories don &apos;t imprint on the
developing brain until about age 5 .
yet somehow the unsub was able to make the victims
hallucinate an almost primal childhood fear of the dark
and of the monsters that lurk within it .
yeah , but how ? this place was locked up tight .
well , both men reported smelling sage .
they must have inhaled a drug .
they had to breathe it in .
anything ?
the plastic tested positive for sevoflurane and scopolamine ,
both powerful disassociatives .
the first is used to put you into a waking dream .
dentists often use it during oral surgery .
the second , in high doses , makes you completely suggestible .
and the unsub uses the first to make the
victims hallucinate their worst fear .
then he uses the second to make them attack that fear
when it &apos;s really the person next to them .
they don &apos;t realize that they &apos;re actually
killing someone that they love .
and once they do , their lives are ruined forever .
even if they plead insanity ,
we &apos;ve got 3 victims who ain &apos;t never goin &apos; back to mayberry .
let &apos;s go back to the part about hallucinating your worst fear .
jj , what &apos;s your earliest fear from childhood ?
being separated from my parents .
dave ?
lon chaney , &quot; phantom of the opera . &quot;
she takes off that mask , forget about it .
kate ?
melissa gordner . that bitch .
and yet each of these victims saw exactly the same thing .
the initial police reports only called it a dark figure ,
but our interviews revealed shared details .
a shadow monster with talons for hands .
and that level of specificity says
it &apos;s not just a childhood nightmare ,
it &apos;s something they actually experienced ,
though they were too young to understand what it was .
but they were from different states .
no , they were adopted in different states .
maybe at some point they shared the same group home .
so the unsub has them recall that memory from childhood
to make them kill as adults .
how do we prove it ?
can you draw me what you saw ?
dad ?
bogeyman &apos;s in my room again .
there &apos;s no such thing .
go to bed .
will you check ?
come on .
is there a bogeyman in here ?
if there is , you have to leave .
how about down here ?
cast him out , dad .
bogeyman ,
i cast you out !
i think we &apos;re good .
do you have a bogeyman , dad ?
yeah . he &apos;s called fica and he haunts my paycheck .
yeah , don &apos;t worry about that .
listen , we can &apos;t do this every night , bud .
i can &apos;t help it .
are you and mom ever gonna live together again ?
i don &apos;t know .
i want to .
why don &apos;t you ?
because sometimes dads make mistakes .
and i &apos;m trying to do everything i can
to fix that mistake with your mom .
go to sleep .
we sure this is the same unsub ?
garcia set up a search parameter for closed adoptions .
bill kinderman was adopted may 5 , 1985 .
the m.e. said this victim slit his own throat .
that &apos;s a big change in m.o.
well , what if that wasn &apos;t the unsub ?
what if that was bill ?
so the only other person in the apartment was his son ,
who slept through the whole thing .
what if the unsub tried to get him to kill his son ,
but his paternal instinct trumped the effects of the drugs ?
thank god for that , but we &apos;re still at square zero .
this unsub committed 4 murders in 4 states .
how is he connecting these victims so quickly ?
well , that is what hotch is trying to figure out right now
with kinderman &apos;s ex @-@ wife .
no . i mean , yes , bill knew he was adopted ,
but it was closed .
he didn &apos;t know anything about his past .
neither did his parents .
two other victims drew these .
they were both adopted , possibly from the same house .
did he ever talk about anything like this ?
no . i mean , he made up all sorts of other stories ,
but nothing about that .
what do you mean ?
he cheated on me , repeatedly .
so i forced him into therapy ,
if he wanted to make the marriage work .
that &apos;s when he started to come home
with all these , well , stories .
uh , like how he was seduced by a high school teacher ,
but he couldn &apos;t remember which one .
or he was molested by a catholic priest at age 12 .
i said , bill ,
was this before or after your bar mitzvah ?
so they were all recovered memories ?
yeah .
and even though i proved to him that they weren &apos;t real ,
he kept insisting that they were .
is this important ?
all right , let &apos;s assume all the victims share
bill kinderman &apos;s propensity for recovered memories .
what does that mean for the unsub ?
it means his drugs would have more of an effect on them .
why them more than a normal person ?
because when something &apos;s remembered for
the first time on a therapist &apos;s couch ,
it &apos;s often a fantasy the patient is
talking themselves into believing .
popular thinking is that recovered memories
are actually just a form of self @-@ hypnosis .
that &apos;s why the patients are so convinced the delusion is real .
so if these victims are already talking
themselves into believing fiction ,
they would be more suggestible when they &apos;re dosed .
we profiled these victims had a
pre @-@ existing condition . i think this is it .
how would the unsub know that ?
because he was there
the last time they made up a story , in 1985 .
so they were only 3 @-@ 4 years old .
kids that age can &apos;t distinguish fantasy from reality .
exactly . and their age plus the time period
puts us right at the height of the
satanic ritual abuse allegations .
oh , crap .
this is a completely different set of circumstances .
was it ? throughout the 1980s , pre @-@ school @-@ age kids
made accusations against their teachers .
mcmartin , fells acres , kern county .
270 cases by 1988 .
numerous innocent teachers had their careers and lives ruined ,
and all the cases were ultimately debunked .
by the bau and the lanning report , thank you very much .
except that was a mass hysteria
involving teachers and kids ,
and these victims were adopted .
well , that &apos;s the deviation that made us miss the profile until now .
30 years ago these victims could have made similar accusations
in a foster home , all saying the same thing , that they saw this .
3 @-@ year @-@ old larry merrin would have said
the monster dragged him down the stairs .
and 4 @-@ year @-@ old daniel karras one @-@ upped
it by adding a sexual detail .
that &apos;s how kids tell stories ,
especially when they &apos;re reinforced
by well @-@ meaning parents , therapists , and cops .
and in doing so , they ruin the unsub &apos;s life ,
and now he &apos;s taking revenge .
ok , so if this is the why , how do we find him ?
we talk to christine mcneil .
maybe she can tell us where the foster home was .
flag on the play there . she &apos;s not talking to anyone .
maybe she will .
so what &apos;s your plan ?
i want to see if the unsub &apos;s signature has any effect on her .
we don &apos;t know his signature .
oh , we do . scopolamine and sevoflurane
are both odorless and tasteless ,
but he introduces the smell of sage to the drugs .
clever . but why her and not the others ?
the act of recounting a false memory hardens it into fact .
larry merrin and daniel karras have both told us their stories .
christine hasn &apos;t .
you &apos;re thinking you can interrupt the process .
maybe .
and if you &apos;re wrong ,
you can return that stuff to garcia .
christine .
can you hear me ?
yes .
i &apos;m hungry .
is it snack time ?
yes , of course . we can get you something to eat .
what would you like ?
i want a snoopy sno cone .
grape flavor .
how old are you , christine ?
4 .
and where do you live ? where &apos;s home ?
home is scary .
christine , you &apos;re safe here .
nothing &apos;s going to happen to you .
that &apos;s not true .
that &apos;s not true .
he &apos;s coming .
he &apos;s--he &apos;s coming .
who &apos;s coming ?
he &apos;s on the other side of the door .
he &apos;s coming ! he &apos;s coming ! he &apos;s coming ! he &apos;s coming !
right ? what ...
no , no . no , no , no , no , no .
what the hell ?
unplug everything !
he &apos;s coming ! he &apos;s coming !
christine , stop !
he &apos;s coming ! he &apos;s coming !
he &apos;s coming ! he &apos;s coming !
shh , shh , shh . christine , where &apos;s home ?
i can &apos;t . i can &apos;t . he &apos;s coming . he &apos;s coming .
who is coming ? who is coming ?
mr scratch .
he &apos;s already here .
this is cozy .
do we have any idea what &apos;s going on yet ?
garcia &apos;s trying to get some answers .
power &apos;s out in the whole building . backup generator , too .
this guy &apos;s got some mojo .
he knocked us out right when we got our best lead .
we could cross @-@ reference the name
mr scratch against old statements .
we &apos;d have to go to the paper files .
we don &apos;t have time . this unsub &apos;s probably already found
every kid that made an accusation from back then .
if we don &apos;t get back online soon
or get a lucky break in this case ,
we &apos;re gonna be looking at
more drugged victims and dead bodies .
ahem .
getting online is gonna be a lot harder than you think .
whoever engineered this ,
he did a complete and total network
and infrastructure shutdown .
but i thought we had
firewalls to protect from this kind of breach .
we totally do . and that &apos;s what scares me .
ok ? look , look .
i managed to capture some of his hacking code
on one of the hard drives before he could fry it .
i printed this out at the copy shop .
this is what i can tell you .
it &apos;s the only thing , but it &apos;s good news .
he wasn &apos;t hacking us .
he was looking for something
in the witness protection files ,
&apos;cause that &apos;s what he raided first .
do we know who in witness protection ?
well , that &apos;s the $ 64,000 question , isn &apos;t it ?
and that i will pay you $ 64,000 if you can answer it .
his encryption algorithms are
beyond the beyond the beyond .
we &apos;re not gonna find him through his computer expertise .
certainly not now . we need to figure out
why he &apos;d take the risk to hack us .
it &apos;s like jj said . he &apos;s
looking for every kid who made an accusation .
one of them is in witness protection .
and he saved them for last
because if he kills that target first ,
we &apos;d be on him immediately .
what ? you see something ?
encryption &apos;s a highly specialized skill set ,
but it &apos;s fundamentally a mathematical process ,
which means it &apos;s a human process ,
but sometimes your technique
can reveal where you learned it .
i think i know where he learned how to do this .
where ?
harvard . which oddly enough
isn &apos;t known for its advanced math program ,
but it is known for one particular class .
when you &apos;re good at math ,
you &apos;re good enough to get into harvard ,
you take a math class called math 15 .
when you &apos;re better than that , you take math 25,
but when you &apos;re the best ,
the absolute best , you take math 55--
honors advanced calculus and linear algebra .
graduates are immediately employed
by the u.s. government
because they &apos;re too dangerous
to work anywhere else .
more specifically , they &apos;re employed at the nsa .
oh , sir , that would make a lot of sense .
this is agent hotchner for mr. axelrod .
no , i won &apos;t hold . tell him he has 20 minutes to meet me .
it sucks for you right now , huh ?
can you help us ?
i can tell you that nobody who ever worked at fort meade
is responsible for the hack .
well , of course not .
he &apos;d be too psychologically unstable for you to hire him .
but he was good with computers ,
so you watched him .
stop . stop talking .
you monitored him as he broke into adoption records ...
i can &apos;t be having this conversation .
i took an oath .
and you kept tabs on him
as he stalked these men and women
just like you did , i took an oath .
through their computers .
and then he learned what he needed to learn
to turn them into killers .
my oath is to protect the laws of this country
and not to spy on u.s. citizens .
i cannot help you .
don &apos;t tell me that .
you already know who it is .
if i were to cooperate with your investigation
electronically or otherwise , i could be fired .
you understand ? fired .
so i &apos;m sorry . you &apos;ll have to find another way .
peter lewis
tell penelope i said hi .
peter lewis .
born and raised in jacksonville , florida .
to call him a math genius would be an understatement .
where was he in the foster system ?
he was--gahh !
this wi @-@ fi hot spot is the worst .
he was not in the foster care system .
he had two very biological parents
and they ran the foster home
until it --
oh , dear .
looks like we found mr. scratch .
so one of the boys in the house
said peter &apos;s dad would dress up as the devil
and the other kids would follow suit .
this has to be where all the victims stayed
before they were adopted and their names were changed .
did lewis &apos; father serve any time ?
uh , the case was pending ,
and then he was killed in jail for being a pedophile .
peter &apos;s residency is still listed as florida .
then he broke into the fbi files to find out
who went into witness protection .
did any of the kids from the home go into witsec ?
that would be a ...
no . no , none of them .
who the hell is he still hunting .
garcia , who ran the investigation in florida ?
uh , hold on .
dr. susannah regan ,
who was responsible for
many of the investigations during the day .
she was a member of the &quot; believe the children &quot; movement ,
which encouraged cops to
believe anything the kid said about the sra ,
and if the kiddos didn &apos;t have anything to say ,
she &apos;d tell the cops to twist their arms until they did .
and then her book was published .
and we came out with the lanning report
and debunked her .
uh @-@ huh . her career flopped
and she received numerous death threats
and she went into witness protection .
she &apos;s such a high @-@ profile target ,
peter had to wait before he could kill her .
if he &apos;s bold enough to hit quantico ,
he knows it &apos;s a one @-@ way ticket .
this is a suicide mission if he locates her before we do .
which would be on a very nice estate in columbia ,
maryland .
i &apos;m closest . send me the address .
sent .
dr. regan .
it &apos;s open . come in .
are you all right ?
agent hotchner ?
i got agent rossi &apos;s message .
doctor , you &apos;re in danger . you need to leave the house .
i understand . i &apos;m in the study .
i &apos;m so glad you &apos;re here .
you need to see this .
he wants you to see this .
no !
you can &apos;t move .
because i say you can &apos;t move .
do you see how this works ?
you do what i say .
peter ...
i didn &apos;t say you could talk .
don &apos;t cry for her .
she was stupid .
and wrong .
she used to burn sage during the sessions .
she said that made it safe to talk about mr. scratch .
what do you see when you look at me ?
do you see mr. scratch ?
you can talk now . i want to know what --
i want to know what you &apos;re feeling .
that &apos;s my team .
they know i &apos;m here .
they &apos;re gonna come looking for me , and if you harm me --
what are you talking about ?
your phone isn &apos;t ringing .
it was ringing .
no , it wasn &apos;t .
very interesting .
you gave yourself away just now .
i did ?
you slipped up .
how do you figure ?
you have no idea , do you ?
you said that she ...
she would ...
burn sage .
but how would you know that ?
unless she questioned you , too .
i know , peter .
i know how those interviews worked ,
how coercive they were ...
with children who were innocent and helpless .
shut up .
she questioned you about your father .
and she wouldn &apos;t stop
until she got the answers she wanted .
so you gave them to her .
shut up .
oh , that was good .
oh , that was so good .
that was so impressive .
the way you got into my head .
it makes me want to know how i get into yours .
you were right .
they did coming calling for you .
they &apos;ll kill you .
are you sure about that ?
spence !
stop fire ! spence is down !
oh , my god .
oh , no .
rossi , where are you hit ?
hotch ! sound off , damn it !
here .
go . go .
where ? !
here .
in the study .
where ?
where is he ?
i shot him . he &apos;s down .
morgan !
now i know what scares you .
no !
no !
son of a bitch .
son of a bitch ...
it &apos;s ok .
you can move now .
here .
i have something for you .
i &apos;m about to come through that front door .
kill me
before i kill you .
rossi , reid , take the front .
jj and i will take the back .
watch your front sight . one of ours is in there .
my gun .
i need my gun .
look . here i come .
kill me .
hotch !
we need a medic in here !
rossi , take it .
they made me see things .
they made me see things .
ok .
he &apos;s gone .
we got him .
i win .
i don &apos;t think so .
you have no idea what i did to him .
i win .
he surrendered .
ambulance is on its way .
he surrendered ? that doesn &apos;t make sense .
we need to get you looked at .
i &apos;m fine .
hey , this is not a suggestion .
i &apos;m fine . thank you .
you have to talk about it .
not tonight .
yes , tonight ,
while it &apos;s still fresh .
i can &apos;t .
it doesn &apos;t ...
parts of it don &apos;t make sense to me .
they don &apos;t have to .
tell me what it smelled like .
tell me how you felt .
start at the beginning , start at the end ,
i don &apos;t care . but start .
now , what do you remember ?
aaron .
aaron .
hotch ?
