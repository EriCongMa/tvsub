The press has named him the prince of darkness.
The dark is his signature
And we'll find that he's always killed this way.
He shows up during a blackout
he robs he kills he leaves a witness.
He got away with it for 26 years. Why did he come back?
Joe and Sylvia Spicer were killed.
Those are my parents.
Why is he doing this?
He keeps a survivor so they'll never forget him
But with you it goes beyond that.
He believes he turned you into the city's hero.
And he wants that recognition.
He wants everyone to know what he's done.
Is that your daughter? Where is she?
She's with my sister.
That's Morgan on the other line.
We're gonna need him at Kristin's house.
Let's get over there.
This is about you.
There's no history at your sister's place.
He probably took them to santa monica
To your old house.
It's only a matter of time before the cell phone reception goes.
We lost Morgan.
Reid? Great.
Put the gun down or she dies.
No pick it up! Pick it up!
On your knees.
Don't do it! Spicer Don't do this! Don't!
No!
What is wrong with you?!
No!
We will find you you sick son of a bitch.
Is that another promise?
Please please...aah!
Ellie I will find you!
This is what you're all afraid of.
The power grid is overloaded and gone completely down
Plunging Los Angeles county into near-total darkness.
City officials are unable or unwilling
To speculate on when the lights might be back on.
Between the blackout and the prince of darkness
Running around out there they advise locking doors tight
And staying very alert.
As one official said off the record
It's going to be a long long night.
Help me! Help me!
He's coming!
Please let me in. Let me in.
Let me in!
Stop!
She's a child.
Let me in!
Ok I'll call-- look I'll call the police.
There's no time!
Do not let her in the house.
Spicer's sister's not in her apartment.
The building manager said she left hours ago.
Morgan and Spicer?
No one's been in or out since the power went down.
Morgan said they were coming here right?
And he was a lot closer than any of us.
Something must have changed.
The cells are down.
Now how the hell do you find them?
What would cause Morgan to change his mind like that
when he knows he can't tell us?
The unsub had Spicer's sister and daughter.
Morgan knew he didn't have a lot of time.
So his first guess had to be right.
The unsub attacked Spicer
specifically through his family.
How long has Spicer's sister lived here?
6-7 months.
Well that's why they didn't come here.
If the unsub wants to hurt Spicer
He'll do it someplace that means something to him.
Morgan must have realized the same thing.
The unsub and Spicer do share one place in common.
Santa Monica.
Where he killed his parents.
Let's go.
This is Kurzbard in major crimes.
I need a priority response.
Kristin.
Kristin. Kristin.
Kristin.
It's getting harder to breathe.
Just try to slow your breathing. Just slow everything down.
We have to get her back.
She's just a baby.
Look at me.
Kristin look at me.
I need you to tell me everything
that you remember about the guy who took Ellie.
I don't want to remember.
I know. Kristin I know you don't
But right now I really need you to try.
Ellie needs it.
My team is going to find us.
They're gonna go to your apartment where we said we were going.
When they see that we're not there
They're gonna figure out where we are the same way I did.
And when they do we will bring Ellie home
But in order to do that
I'm gonna need you to think.
Is Matt...
Is he dead?
Kristin please just try to focus on remembering.
Ok.
This guy
Has been traveling all over the country.
How?
How did he bring you here?
In an rv.
An old...
filthy RV.
Hungry?
Ellie?
Don't worry.
You'll get used to it.
You let me get away on purpose didn't you?
So that they'd open their door.
We're gonna make a great team.
Spicer?
Kurz we got here as fast as we could.
What about Kristin?
She was beaten and sexually assaulted.
She's out in the ambulance.
And you already know the bad guy took Ellie with him.
One more thing--there was another couple murdered
a mile from here an hour ago.
We've got a team there
but we're pretty sure it was the same guy.
Where's Matt?
Ah! Damn it. Just put a bandage on it
and leave me alone.
How is he?
It's nothing Hotch.
He needs a CAT scan stitches
and a lot of rest.
She's right Morgan.
Guys I'm not going to any hospital
until we find that little girl.
Now please just put a bandage on it.
Morgan what's the notebook?
I asked the sister to tell me everything
she could remember about the unsub.
And what's her condition?
It's bad.
I'll go check on her.
Hold on a second fellas.
Kristin I'm Agent Prentiss.
I work with Agent Morgan.
Is it ok if I ride along with you?
If you're coming we need to go now.
Thank you.
Ok we're good.
How many cops are there in L.A.?
City or county?
You actually know the answer.
I know both answers.
It's white and extremely dirty.
A very old RV.
With a male white in his fifties
accompanied by an 8-year-old girl.
Derek...
I'm all right.
You don't look all right.
Reid drop it. Sorry.
The local bureau office found us these satellite phones.
It should bypass any outage problems on the ground.
Good.
Any word on Ellie?
I was just--
It's not you.
Between the blackout and the prince of darkness
running around out there be advised to lock your...
I forgot something.
Put the mask back on.
I forgot the radio.
What?
He listens to his car radio constantly.
The news. He would stop
whenever he would hear something about him--
The radio--he listens--
Ok I got it.
He listens to the radio.
Put the mask on.
Something else.
The other agent-- you have to tell him.
I made him promise...
Garcia.
Baby boy you all good?
Listen I need you to run something for me.
You really had us worried. And by "us " I mean me.
I didn't know where you were--
Now Garcia.
Ok.
All right I'm looking for an old RV.
Partial California plates--Michael-David-3.
That's all she was able to get.
The victim thinks it may have been
the first 3 letters of the plate but she's not sure.
Yes sir.
All right call me back on this number
as soon as you get a bite.
You know she really needs to be more professional sometimes.
She gets the job done every time.
I told him Hotch.
I told him that we should wait for backup
But he wouldn't listen to me.
We split up and he headed around back
before I could stop him.
Morgan sometimes when it comes to family
common sense and procedure go out the window.
We do the best you can.
This unsub raped the aunt
and then beat her for no reason.
She didn't resist man
and he still pistol-whipped her until her ribs were crushed.
He killed Spicer while he was on his knees.
He was unarmed.
This guy's a pure psychopath.
I want this guy.
We'll get him.
Well we better do it fast.
Taking Ellie was like a game to him.
The sick bastard thought it was funny.
He's gonna get pissed off at her man.
She's nothing but a little girl.
She's gonna show him fear.
And when she does...
He's gonna kill her.
...new permits which provide a sense
Of future home construction fell 3.5...
We're not a team.
You got us in.
We did it together.
But I--I didn't know.
And if I didn't know we aren't a team.
Yet.
Why do you have to kill people?
My dad says people who hurt other people are cowards
That they never hurt somebody who can protect themselves.
So how would he explain
What happened to him tonight?
He let you go so that you wouldn't hurt me.
That doesn't make you brave.
He let me go?
To save me.
You're really not like him at all.
Get back
Come here.
Come here!
Should we kill him?
What?
No!
You see Ellie?
We are a team.
You just decided to let that man live.
Except the question isn't why do I kill people
The question is why I don't kill everybody.
I decide who dies
But mostly
I decide who lives.
I'm like...
God.
And now you are too.
...from L.A. Police. They're now saying
that the prince of darkness may be in an older white rv
making its way around Los Angeles tonight.
Police are advising that anyone seeing
A dirty poorly maintained white rv
Contact them immediately
And do not under any circumstances...
Uh-oh.
Approach it.
What are you doing?
Even god finds that sometimes
People just have bad luck.
Calling someone?
Just calling triple-a.
I got a flat.
Just uh trying to get it fixed.
No wait--ohh!
Police are also saying that the prince of darkness
May now be traveling with a young girl
an 8-year-old girl as a hostage.
She's described as having long brown hair.
Police add that you should
notify authorities immediately if you spot her.
All right what we have is an unsub
In complete behavioral chaos.
Meaning?
Serial offenders especially long-term successful ones
don't just suddenly change what they do or how they do it.
Going after a high-risk target like a police detective
and then all of a sudden abducting a child
is fairly unheard of.
Fairly?
Sometimes they devolve
As they know we're getting closer to them
and their time's running out.
But this unsub doesn't appear to be devolving.
Devolution generally means loss of control.
They find it harder and harder
to keep the outside world from noticing them.
I think he's becoming more controlled.
He spent a lifetime murdering seemingly random victims
Then out of nowhere sought out Spicer
Recreated his parents' murder lured him into a trap
killed him and took his daughter.
The behavioral spectrum is alarmingly different.
Yeah Garcia.
Hi. I want to have better news mon ami
but there are zero RVs in the state of California
With M-D-3 in that order on the plate. I'm sorry.
Sorry's not helping anybody. I need results.
Garcia's got nothing on the partial plate.
Maybe Kristin's wrong.
It's not surprising
Considering her situation at the time.
So how the hell are we supposed to find this guy?
We can contact him.
...lasers and other technology so sophisticated
images will depict individual telephone poles and boulders.
Images will help determine erosion and sea-level changes
and also provide critical information from flood...
Kristin remembered in the ambulance
That the unsub listens to news radio incessantly.
He would even stop assaulting her
if the broadcaster said anything about the prince of darkness.
Makes sense for a narcissist.
Oh no.
What is it?
The LAPD just put all the information they have out to the press.
What do you mean?
A spokesperson at the crime scene
Was talking about the RV and about Ellie.
So this guy knows exactly what we know.
That might force him to dump the RV.
Or kill--
No I don't think so.
Why not Rossi?
Well he could have killed you and the sister.
He didn't. He kept you alive.
He can't be surprised that we know what he's driving
and that he has a hostage.
But how many news radio stations are there in Los Angeles?
I don't know 20 or so.
We can't just guess which one he listens to.
What about the emergency alert system?
It would be a way to
communicate over all the stations simultaneously.
How do we do that?
I don't really know. How hard could it be to work out?
Is this your son's bicycle?
What the hell...
I--I may have run it over.
What'd you do back over it again?
Actually twice.
Honey? What was that?
Ellie.
Paul?
You see Ellie?
Bicycles mean kids
And kids mean parents who are easy to control.
So go get the boy.
Bring him to the parents' room.
Paul!
What are you gonna do?
I have a widow to comfort.
Go on.
I am acutely aware that this is an unusual request.
It's an unusual situation.
Then I need to speak to your boss.
No I'm not calling back. Transfer me.
Uh yes who--who's this?
Uh and what's your title sir?
Ok uh I'm agent Jennifer Jareau the communications liaison
for the FBI's behavioral analysisi unit.
I need access to the emergency alert system in Los Angeles
And I was directed to your office.
Yeah the emergency alert system.
Get the boy in the closet.
What?
Do it!
Now!
It'll be ok I promise.
Don't close the door all the way.
What are you doing?
I got the boy and I got the clothes.
So?
So you said if I did what you told me
Then you'd let them live.
Really. Go in the bathroom and close the door.
Damn it!
He has a brother.
I told him to tell the neighbors to call the police
And then tell the next house
And the next house and the next house.
You know he's probably told the whole block by now.
Can't kill them all can you?
I can try.
Come on.
Kristin wanted me to tell you
She's sorry she made you promise her brother.
She said it wasn't fair.
You want to tell me what she made you promise?
That I wouldn't let anything happen to Ellie.
Well she's right. That's not fair.
How is anything we handle out here fair?
Every time they put me on hold
I get one layer higher on homeland security.
The E.A.S. Is coordinated by the fcc fema
And the national weather service.
It's a bureaucratic pile of steaming--
Um ma'am?
Yes?
Thank you for holding.
Yes
I'm with the FBI. We're here in los angeles.
A boy just woke up his neighbors.
Said he escaped from the prince of darkness.
What?
He said they're still in his house right now.
They?
There's a girl with him.
Let me know.
Yeah.
We got you man!
There he is!
That's him!
Get in there.
Keys.
Always by the door.
Come on.
Go on.
Go on! Get in the car!
Go on!
What's the matter scared?
Shut up.
The neighbors all banded together and came after him
But he was already in the car.
Ballsy neighbors.
California has its moments.
The first units all got here within 4 minutes of the call.
Local watch commander locked down a 5-square-mile grid
And there's an apb on the car.
We believe they never made it out of the area.
Tell your officers not to approach him if they spot him.
He's getting desperate.
Won't be easy with a cop-killer.
Then you'd better ask them
How they'd feel about getting that cop's daughter killed.
He cut her hair.
I swear to god when I get my hands on this son of a--
It actually might be good.
Why disguise somebody you're gonna kill?
Here's how he stays awake all night.
Look at this article on Spicer.
We already know he was obsessed
with all the attention Spicer was getting.
Yeah but look what's underlined 3 times.
"8-year-old Ellie bright happy child."
This one's just...
Special.
"I don't normally take to kids
But this one's just special."
What?
That's what he said back at the house.
Ellie was his target all along not Spicer.
Yes. Yes I'm still here.
Yep I'm always gonna be here.
Ok. My name is Jennifer--
No. Do you know what?
I'm not going to explain this entire thing again
to another mid-level bureaucrat
who can't give me a sufficient answer.
Put someone on the damn phone who can authorize what I need.
He wasn't after Spicer.
We were just coming to the same conclusion.
It doesn't make sense he hasn't killed the girl
if she wasn't what he was after.
He disguised her to keep her.
Look at this. There's a stack of them in the RV.
Reid's reading them all right now.
So we profiled his obsession with Spicer
was over not getting credit for his law enforcement career.
But maybe it's the daughter he's not getting credit for.
He thinks he's responsible for her.
Well she wouldn't even be here
if he hadn't allowed Spicer to live 25 years ago.
A bastardized version of a grandparent.
That's a pretty twisted delusion.
Well it only has to make sense to him.
And when a delusion like that crashes it crashes hard.
Hey guys.
The murders we found in Orange County in 1985
they might not have been his first.
Why did you do this? We were gonna be a--
I told you.
We're not a team.
Not a team?
We were going to--
I was nice to you.
The lights are back on
Just in time for morning of course.
In other news the noose is
getting tighter around the prince of darkness.
The LAPD believe they've narrowed down
the area of the city he's in.
Yes. I'm--
Yes ma'am.
Uh yes madame secretary.
I'm so sorry to bother you this early but it's very--
Oh you have. Fully briefed great.
Um--yeah of course. I'm writing down the number
right now.
Great.
Thank you so much madame secretary.
Yeah yeah I will let you know how it goes.
Great. Thank you.
Hotchner.
We have access to the local emergency alert system.
The secretary personally set it up herself.
It's in the city command center.
Good. Get an LPAD unit to take you over there
Get the system up and running
and I need you to start talking to him immediately.
Excuse me?
It's gonna take me too long to get there from here.
I need you to talk to him JJ.
Me?
I'll give you some strategies.
The unsub may still be in this area
and if he surfaces we need to be close.
I'm not a hostage negotiator.
I'm sorry. You are today.
Dr. Reid you're on your own cellular.
Yeah. The power came back here a few minutes ago.
How's my main man doing?
On the completely safe assumption
that you're not talking about me
Let's just say I wouldn't want to be this unsub
when Morgan finally gets his hands on him.
That bad huh?
Has he ever yelled at you before?
Touche.
How can I be of service?
How far back can you go with your records Garcia?
How far back you talkin'?
Uh a murder investigation from 1968.
This is the room.
So what do I do?
Flip that switch when you're ready
and you'll cut into every signal on the radio bands AM and FM.
That's it?
It's made to be easy.
Ok. Thank you.
JJ.
I'm here.
We're gathering some background information
on Flynn that could be very helpful.
Just sit tight for a minute.
Ok.
You ok?
Hotch...
what if I mess up?
Don't worry. You won't.
I'll call you right back.
Now...
get inside.
Get inside and don't come out until I call for you!
Already?
Do you doubt it?
Yeah I'll put you on speaker.
Ok. Let me preface this by saying
that a 40-year-old murder in a suburb of Los Angeles
is an absurdly impossible request.
Having said that yours truly
happens to know that the pollack library at Cal State--
Garcia.
Yes sir sorry uh...
Anyway this murder was quite the scandal.
for southern California in the sixties that's saying something.
Ok I don't know who was talking right then
But...word.
So Nora Flynn was a prostitute and a drug addict
Living in a desert community just outside of los angeles.
It appears bikers were her stock in trade rough bikers
And one fateful day she and her client
Were murdered by her 13-year-old son billy.
Shot to death.
The customer ironically named john
Was able to tell the police before he died
That billy made him beg for his life and then shot him anyway.
That's him.
And he was convicted but...
Right. He's a juvenile.
So at 18 he was released in 1973
Never heard from again.
Oh he was heard from.
And he never released a statement
as to why he killed them
Although it does appear his childhood was horrific.
I'm sending you a picture
of him on the day he was released to your PDAs.
Make sure you send the files to JJ.
Of course my liege.
Garcia bids you ad--
Garcia wait a minute.
Hey.
Hey back.
Baby girl I'm sorry for taking your head off.
Oh darling our love is a rock.
No bad day can come between us.
Word.
Come home safe.
I'll leave a light on.
Hotch.
Jj listen.
The most important thing is that you build rapport with him.
Uh rapport. Ok.
I'm asking you to do one of the hardest things
that anybody in our position ever has to do.
I need you to empathize with him. Sympathize.
Don't judge the things he's done.
Garcia's sending you a file on him and his childhood.
Look it over. It'll help.
If he hears that you care about him
That's how you're gonna get him to care about Ellie.
He has to understand that he's putting her through the same pain
He went through as a child.
Uh ok.
But it has to be his decision
Because power is all-important to him.
Power? Ok.
You're gonna be fine.
Just talk to him.
All right.
Go over the file and start when you're ready.
Oh wait. You're gonna be on the line right?
I'll be listening.
And the heat wave continues to be the top story in the southland
With temperatures expected to top 105 degrees
And excessive heat...
Come on billy I bought you from your mama.
This man paid good money.
Mom! No!
Do as you're told!
Mom! Make him stop!
I'll be gentle Billy. Don't worry.
No!
Billy?
Billy Flynn?
Did you--
Who's Billy Flynn?
Mr. Flynn I-- I don't know for sure
That you can hear me but--
My name is Jennifer Jareau.
I--I work for the fbi as a communications liaison
For the--the Behavioral uh...
Ok. Mr. Flynn I--
I--I want to talk to you about letting Ellie Spicer go.
I mean I want to ask you to.
Uh see I'm not a hostage negotiator uh
I've never done anything like this at all ever
But um sometimes circumstances it's...
Look...
You can tell I'm not a hostage negotiator.
But I am a mother.
And I...
I know what your mother did to you when you were little.
What she was
What she made you watch what she let men do to you
And it makes me so...
It's just not fair.
And no one-- no one can make that better.
I wish I could. I do. But...
If I--if I could somehow go back there
And you know make what was happening to you stop
If I could just...
You know pick you up and just tell you
That it'll all be ok.
That's what moms are supposed to do.
They're not supposed to be the cause of your pain
They're supposed to make it go away.
They're supposed to hold you
And tell you everything is gonna be all right.
They're supposed to tell you that thunder is angels bowling
And that it's ok to be afraid of the dark
And that it's not silly to think there might be monsters in your closet
and that it's ok that if you want to climb in bed with them just this once
'cause it's scary in the room all alone.
They're supposed to say it's ok to be afraid
And not be the thing you're afraid of.
But most importantly
They're supposed to love you no matter what.
What happened to you isn't fair it's not right
But um...
I'm supposed to empathize with you.
Sympathize. Understand.
But I can't.
That--that would be a lie.
The truth is I don't understand what you've done.
I don't sympathize with you killing people all these years.
And I especially don't understand you taking Ellie.
What I can do is tell you what a mother should tell you
That you can't take away your pain
by hurting someone else.
That it doesn't make all the nights
You went to bed scared and alone
any better if you scare someone else
the way you're scaring Ellie.
What happened to you it isn't fair.
But what you're doing to her isn't fair either
And if anyone should understand what that feels like
It's you.
You have the power.
You can do what you want to do.
But for once
You can choose to use that power
to do for Ellie what should have been done for you.
You can choose letting her go.
You can choose teaching her
that yes there are monsters
and it's ok to be afraid of them.
But it's not ok to let them win.
And it's not ok to be one.
Agent Prentiss.
Yes. Hello doctor.
Yes sir.
Thank you.
Both of Kristin's lungs collapsed.
She died a few minutes ago.
Ellie's got no one now.
Kurzbard.
He let her go.
Where?
He got out of the car and he just let her go.
She's in a house about 6 blocks from here.
Where is he now?
He's in another house up the street.
JJ. I don't know if you know. He let her go.
You did it.
We have SWAT on the way Kurz.
And an HPT team.
Yeah but they'll be a while.
We had a phone sent in with a direct line to this one
But so far--
He's watching us.
This is Detective Kurzbard LAPD.
He wants to talk to you.
What?
He wants me to come in.
Morgan.
I know this guy Hotch.
He didn't kill me before he's not gonna kill me this time.
No.
I believe in my original profile.
He will not hurt me unless I show him fear.
Listen...
When you needed us we were there for you.
This one is mine.
You sure?
As I've ever been.
In here Agent.
It's over Flynn.
5 years ago
I would have just killed you right there in that bedroom.
You couldn't.
Couldn't?
I'm not afraid of you.
You really think that matters that much to me?
Then shoot me.
Go ahead. Shoot me.
You can't do it.
I study guys like you for a living.
I know more about you than you know about yourself.
Well you may not be afraid but they are.
You point that gun at them and I will kill you
And that is another promise.
My mother used to dance with me.
You know who Cyd Charisse was?
She kind of looked like her.
Put the gun down and get up.
When I shot her...
She looked at me with such...
She was...
I think relieved.
I think I helped her escape.
Was that really true or did I just imagine it
to make killing her easier to live with?
Did I help her escape?
Did I...
Set her free?
Is that what you think you've been doing all these years
Helping people?
Well no I suppose not.
Do you believe in heaven?
This is your last chance.
You think I might see her there?
Maybe get a second chance?
I'd really like that.
"A family is a place where minds come in contact with one another.
"If these minds love one another
