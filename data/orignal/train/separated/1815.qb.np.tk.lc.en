the first 24h after surgery are critical .
every breath you take , every fluid you make
is meticulously recorded and analyzed ...
celebrated ... or mourned .
but what about the next 24 hours ?
so you and cristina are going fishing ?
whose idea was that ?
owen &apos;s concerned about leaving cristina alone ,
so when i told him i was going fishing ...
right , but you haven &apos;t actually spoken to cristina ?
actually , i have .
you spoke to her ? when ?
i called her last night . well ,
well , she must have been drunk or something ,
because she doesn &apos;t do the wilderness .
i mean , there aren &apos;t even any bathrooms in the wilderness .
look , i know you &apos;re concerned about her ,
but i also know that there &apos;s nothing else we can do right now .
but you can ?
because if fishing is your big plan to get her back to work
we &apos;re not trying to get her back to work .
we just want to make sure she &apos;s okay .
well , she &apos;s not okay ,
and she &apos;s not going to be okay until she gets back to work .
i know cristina . she needs to work .
meredith ...
well , i mean , she &apos;s not gonna show today .
i mean , she may have agreed to it last night ,
but in the cold , hard light of day ,
there &apos;s no way--
what happens when that first day turns to two ...
and weeks turn into months ?
hey , you wanna do it real quick ?
nothing says good morning like shower sex .
look , i hope you don &apos;t take this the wrong way ,
because the sex with you has been ... great ,
but ... it just ...
it just makes me miss arizona .
the sex with you just makes me sad .
oh , no . that came out wrong . sorry .
no , i get it .
yeah ?
last night when we were doing it ,
i was thinking about lexie . i was thinking--
i &apos;m gonna need some more consonants ?
when we were having sex , you were thinking about lexie ?
okay , now that &apos;s just rude .
well , you just
said having sex with me makes you sad .
&apos;cause i &apos;m amazing .
i know .
that &apos;s why i suggested the wake @-@ up call .
just get out .
seriously . get out .
now i &apos;m missing lexie even more .
what was that ?
nothing .
i am amazing !
uh , let me give you a hand with that .
thanks .
hey . bye .
thank you .
what happens when the immediate danger has passed ...
when the machines are disconnected ...
and the teams of doctors and nurses are gone ?
well , i @-@ i should go .
cristina .
there are no bathrooms ... out there , you know ?
i know .
surgery is when you get saved .
but post @-@ op ...
after surgery ...
is when you heal .
but what if you don &apos;t ?
you &apos;re removing a gallbladder from someone &apos;s mouth .
i mean , no incision , no scar . it &apos;s like you were never there .
i-- sorry . i &apos;ll stop talking .
you want to do one of these ?
is that a trick question ?
the-- the trick is , how bad do you want it ?
um , wh @-@ when i was little , i wanted a pony--
like , really , really wanted a pony .
this feels a little bit like that .
good , &apos; cause i &apos;m having a contest .
grabbing the gallbladder .
now each of you is researching a different
protocol aimed at trying to eliminate fistulas ,
but it &apos;s taking too long .
so this is the incentive .
the person whose protocol leads to the fewest number
of post @-@ operative complication
gets to pull a gallbladder out of a mouth .
there she is .
beautiful .
all righty .
may i be excused ?
i am checking on my patients every two hours , and it &apos;s time .
go ahead .
uh , may i-- may i be excused , please ?
uh ... me , too ?
go .
you &apos;re a mad genius .
if i was a genius ,
i &apos;d have rid the world of fistulas by now .
good morning .
morning .
how &apos;s cristina ?
she &apos;s fine .
she &apos;s fishing .
she &apos;s fishing ?
why ?
ask him .
have you got any better ideas ?
no .
no . see ya .
how do i look ?
i &apos;m about to propose to my girlfriend .
so besides the gown , and the i.v. ,
and the ghostly pallor from being in the hospital for the past week ,
what do you think , do i have a shot ?
she &apos;d be a fool to say no .
good luck .
hey , can either of you use me today ?
i &apos;m supposed to be with stark ,
but he wants to work with someone else .
ouch .
the guy &apos;s an ass .
maybe heartlessness is a peds thing .
no offense , but your girlfriend leaving town really screwed me .
i mean , i &apos;m happy for the children of malawi and
yeah , no , you should be worried for them .
right now she &apos;s making them fall in love with her .
&quot; oh , i &apos;ll uncleft your palate ,
i &apos;ll unherniate your hernia , i &apos;m here for you . i &apos;m yours . &quot;
yeah , and then someplace better will come along ...
mm @-@ hmm . peru or india-- and suddenly she &apos;s all ...
&quot; i know i was helping you
and i made you all kinds of promises , but-- &quot;
&quot; but i gotta go . &quot;
&quot; yeah , have fun with stark . &quot;
i miss you .
mark .
what , you &apos;re saying you don &apos;t miss me ?
pretty much what i &apos;m saying .
you seeing someone ?
yes . his name &apos;s andrew rabb .
he had a tumor removed from his pancreas three days ago ,
and i &apos;m trying to make sure he doesn &apos;t develop a fistula .
go . cure fistulas . or fistulae .
fistulas .
i miss you .
okay , two minutes out .
so , uh ... you ever go fishing with derek ?
i &apos;m a surgical resident .
when would i have time for that ?
you get a day off now and then .
i spend my days off here , where she should be .
meredith ...
what are your plans for her for tomorrow ,
bowling with bailey , cooking class ?
i &apos;m not sure , but , uh ...
bowling with bailey -- that sounds fun .
trina paiz , 27 , stable .
only complaint is a lacerated ear .
pretty amazing considering she fell 100 feet into a ravine .
apparently her husband broke her fall .
jason paiz , 27
jason !
grey , take her to trauma two .
is he okay ?
bp 70 palp in the field .
please .
he has to be okay .
he has to be okay .
started two large @-@ bore ivs ...
okay , trina , do you know where you are ?
a hospital i @-@ in seattle .
i ... i don &apos;t know the name . i &apos;m not from here .
i &apos;m here on my honeymoon .
my god , my husband ...
dr. hunt is excellent , so he &apos;s in good hands .
do you remember what happened ?
we were hiking up this mountain ,
and we wanted a picture ,
so we handed our camera to some guy .
and ... we posed ... we kissed .
no , we were kissing , and then ...
the next thing i know , i &apos;m looking up at the sky ,
and then we &apos;re on the ground or ...
jason &apos;s on the ground , and i &apos;m on top of him ,
and ...
please tell me he &apos;s not gonna die .
he can &apos;t die .
wife is stable . nervous , but --
she should be . his abdomen is distended ,
and he has a lot of internal bleeding .
systolic &apos;s 60 , dr. hunt .
pressure &apos;s dropping .
let &apos;s get him to an o.r. now .
watch that line .
quickly .
all right . let &apos;s move .
grey , no time to scrub . come on .
gown me .
on three . one , two , three .
see if his type and cross is back yet .
in the meantime , get me some ffp
and some factor vii up here .
drape him .
good . okay .
let &apos;s go . 10 @-@ blade .
10 @-@ blade .
i hope no one is wearing new shoes .
more laps .
laps ! laps !
grey , i can &apos;t see anything .
i &apos;m suctioning .
suction &apos;s too slow . use your hands . another suction .
how &apos;s his pressure ?
79 over 40 .
he &apos;s like a bucket full of holes .
i &apos;m gonna occlude the aorta at the hiatus
till we can get his pressure back up .
how many units has he gotten ?
three units of o @-@ neg ,
one unit a @-@ positive type specific ,
and one unit of ffp .
okay . let &apos;s get some more packs in there .
let &apos;s try and isolate this bleeder
until we figure out what we &apos;re dealing with .
laps . more . keep &apos; em coming . more .
more . quickly . faster . i don &apos;t want to have to keep asking .
can i make a suggestion ?
if you mount the rod holders mid @-@ ship ,
we can both reach the rods from either end of the boat .
after you called last night , i did some research .
i didn &apos;t want to be anything less than seaworthy .
well , it &apos;s a lake .
still .
uh , actually , it &apos;s , uh ...
it &apos;s a great idea .
you may need clip @-@ on mounts to clear the gunwales .
are you gonna be like this all day ?
i can &apos;t help it .
i &apos;ve tried to avoid getting a new hip
because i just didn &apos;t want to deal with the recovery , but --
there &apos;s no cartilage left , bone spurs .
our daughter &apos;s an orthodontist in sarasota .
sheila .
what ? they should know that we have
medical people in the family .
we &apos;re not just nobodies off the street .
mr. cherkovsky , clearly you need a new hip .
now i &apos;ve had a lot of success with a new ,
minimally invasive technique . dr. karev .
well , she &apos;d use computer guidance
to avoid any excess radiation .
and she &apos;d make a small incision along the muscle ...
so we would avoid damaging the hip muscle .
now i can fit you in this afternoon at 2 : 00 p.m.
and have you walking out of here by the end of the week .
why does she have an opening ? why isn &apos;t she busier ?
what my wife wants to know -- - i- i heard her .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m standing right here .
um , actually , i &apos;m just coming off of some leave ,
and so my schedule &apos;s flexible .
but , uh , i &apos;m the only surgeon in the northwest
doing minimally invasive hip replacements .
ask her why no else is doing it if it &apos;s so great .
because they can &apos;t , and she can .
tell them you want a second opinion . - sheila --
no , no , no . you know what ? actually , your wife &apos;s right .
it &apos;s always a good idea to get another opinion .
call dan miller
and see if he can squeeze them in right now .
maybe i should mention
that their daughter is an orthodontist .
yeah , they &apos;re gonna meet with miller ,
hear about his 6 @-@ week recovery period ,
and coming running back . keep my 2 : 00 p.m. slot open .
we &apos;re gonna be replacing ron &apos;s hip .
hey , morning , eli .
um , did you send mr. rabb &apos;s sample
of pancreatic fluid to the lab yet ?
not yet .
uh , i asked for it over an hour ago .
yeah , i was letting him rest .
he didn &apos;t sleep much last night .
dr. grey , check out mrs. kay .
day three post @-@ op , no fistula .
already walking right away , eating right away ,
isn &apos;t that right , mrs. kay ?
can i go back to bed now ? i &apos;m tired .
one more lap .
terrible .
okay , there is no evidence that shows
getting patients up faster makes any difference at all .
how &apos;s it going with your protocol ?
it looks like you -- okay-- added just another medicine
to your drug regimen there , huh ?
yeah , i mean ,
well , if you call octreotide &quot; just another medicine . &quot;
so you &apos;re still , uh , sticking with the little list ?
yeah . standard post @-@ op protocol
with a checklist i &apos;ve developed for accountability .
oh , my gosh . so you know what ?
when i was little , i- i wanted a pony , too .
and do you know what happened ?
i , uh , i worked really hard and i got one .
mr. rabb probably can &apos;t sleep at night
because you &apos;re letting him sleep during the day .
get the fluid sample now .
hey . how &apos;d it go ?
hey . uh , not so well .
oh . i &apos;m sorry .
nah , i don &apos;t blame her .
i was proposing for all the wrong reasons .
i mean , i liked her and all ,
but what i liked most about her was her p.p.o.
you don &apos;t have insurance ?
capped out about three operations ago .
i &apos;ve been charging it on my credit cards .
do you mind if i look at your chart ?
no , go ahead .
thanks .
i &apos;m warning you , though , it &apos;s pretty scary stuff .
just saying .
you have von hippel @-@ lindau disease .
and you have been hospitalized for over 200 days in the last three years ?
lot of good memories .
dr. webber &apos;s your surgeon ?
not for long . they &apos;re discharging me today .
you have a pretty dangerous tumor on your adrenal gland .
they &apos;re not gonna just throw you out on the street .
you know what ? let me see what i can do .
look , i don &apos;t know how much your fee is , uh , but--
but i know i can &apos;t afford it .
i heard you just got married .
how &apos;d you meet your husband ?
uh , we worked together .
there was a no @-@ dating policy at our firm .
oh , my god .
you &apos;re doing great . keep talking .
he kept asking me out ,
and ... he &apos;s just like that .
you tell him he can &apos;t do something ,
it just makes him want to do it more .
sounds like my kinda guy .
and then there was this work bowling party ,
and ... we were both waiting in line
to return our shoes .
and ... he just kissed me .
and then i was like , &quot; okay , i need to find a new job , &quot;
because he was a really good kisser .
is .
he is a really good kisser .
his b.p. is still 70 .
with all these lap pads , it should be better by now .
his pelvis and his spleen look clean .
has to be his liver . try a pringle maneuver .
let &apos;s see if we can stop this bleeding.- okay .
keep going . okay .
damn it . damn it . that &apos;s what i was afraid of .
his vena cava is torn . you can let go .
dr. hunt , what are we doing ?
this is-- this is a lethal injury .
he &apos;s on his honeymoon .
pressure &apos;s still dropping . 60 over 40 .
dr. hunt , what do we do ?
dr. hunt ?
dr. hunt , what &apos;s your plan ?
you have to have a plan . we can &apos;t stand here
and do nothing while this guy bleeds out .
if you don &apos;t have a plan , then
okay , 10 @-@ blade .
here you go .
it &apos;s a long shot ,
but if we crack his chest , put in a shunt ,
and bypass the blood flow trying to get to the heart ,
it &apos;ll give us time to make the repair .
you don &apos;t get to talk to me like that in my o.r.
if you can &apos;t keep your problems--
our problems-- outside , then you should go .
bone saw .
what is this ? wait . don &apos;t tell me ?
crankbait-- best used in muddy water .
oh , i know .
quiz me .
is this a spinnerbait ?
you know , the fish can hear you .
did you read about that in your research ?
fishing is supposed to be quiet .
is this a spinner bait ?
i &apos;m not quizzing you . i &apos;m fishing .
you &apos;re no fun .
maybe we should move the boat over to the other side of the lake .
no .
this is a good spot .
for tanning maybe .
is this typical ?
i mean , to go for hours without a bite ?
well , the only thing predictable about fishing
is that it &apos;s unpredictable .
wow . that &apos;s deep .
yeah . why don &apos;t you ponder that for a while ...
quietly ?
okay , i pondered it , but the thing is ,
i don &apos;t agree with the basic premise .
okay , assuming a lake has fish in it , which this lake does ,
and assuming that you &apos;re using the right
baits and lures , which we are ,
you should be able to predict getting more bites than , um ,
like none an hour .
you know--
which leads me to believe that the fish are elsewhere ,
like-- like over there , or over there , or over there .
right , and if you were over there ,
you would scare them away with your incessant chatter .
fishing is supposed to be quiet .
and it &apos;s supposed to involve catching fish ,
which we could do if we moved the boat
to where the fish are-- are-- are sleeping or-- or eating--
just stop . stop talking . stop worrying .
stop thinking . stop .
can we-- can we-- can we just--
can we just try it my way , please ?
no .
i can &apos;t stop .
i can &apos;t turn my mind off .
yes , you can .
but--
you can . just fish .
do it pro bono .
look , henry needs long @-@ term medical care ,
and the hospital just can &apos;t afford to take that on .
oh , so we do nothing ?
no , we treat him with drugs
and we schedule regular follow @-@ ups at the clinic .
well , you might as well do nothing .
look , i wish i could treat him . i really do .
but my hands are tied .
that is a load of crap .
i have seen you bend the rules around here .
if i was bailey or shepherd ,
i &apos;m sure that your hands wouldn &apos;t be so tied .
dr. altman , that &apos;s enough .
i &apos;m sorry .
cristina yang is fishing today .
she is one of the most talented surgical residents
i have ever seen ,
and she is fishing instead of operating ,
and that is partly my fault .
i just want to do something good today .
make it up , pay it forward-- whatever you want to call it--
i ... i just need to do some good .
i &apos;ll ... set up a meeting with the review board .
thank you .
look , they met with dr. miller three hours ago .
give it time .
they &apos;re not gonna call &apos; cause they &apos;re idiots .
hey , where are you going ?
i &apos;m going up to miller &apos;s office to tell &apos;em what idiots they are .
no , they &apos;re gonna call .
all right , now you &apos;re just being stubborn .
yes , i am being stubborn .
i am stubbornly choosing to believe
that sometimes people make sane decisions ,
like having minimally invasive surgery when it &apos;s available .
i am stubbornly choosing to believe that
not all people are evil and bad
and leave me in airports .
told ya .
good . the shunt is in . secure it inferiorly .
umbilical tape .
here you go , doctor .
uh , now we &apos;re gonna fix the i.v.c.
i &apos;m gonna lift the liver only enough for you
to gain access to the tear .
you &apos;re gonna let me sew ?
are you questioning my judgment or are you saying thank you ?
no , i just ... thank you .
good . so ...
one stitch at a time .
slow and steady . ready ?
okay . 3 @-@ 0 prolene , boki .
mm . anybody want my soup ?
it &apos;s reminding me of pancreatic fluid .
oh , mm @-@ hmm . then i definitely want it .
sparkle .
that was the name of my pony .
dr. kepner , your patient ,
mrs. hathaway just came into the e.r.
she &apos;s in septic shock . c.t. showed a fistula .
dr. bailey wants you in o.r. 2 right away .
no . mrs. hathaway ?
we just discharged her three days ago . she was fine ! hmm .
and then there were two .
um , eli , i need another sample of mr. rabb &apos;s fluid .
uh , that &apos;s gonna be tough . i took the drain out .
you what ?
well , with the drain in ,
he can &apos;t turn over , which means he has to sleep on his back ,
which means he isn &apos;t sleeping , so--
okay ,
just call radiology .
we have to put it back in .
i need to be able to see the fluid
to tell if there &apos;s an infection .
well , i can tell by looking at it that it &apos;s not infected .
just call radiology .
look , if dr.bailey
wants it put back in , then i will .
no , she &apos;s in surgery .
well , then it &apos;ll have to wait .
fine . okay . you know , i &apos;ll-- i &apos;ll do it myself .
you &apos;re not touching that patient .
excuse me ?
you have your list , but i have 12 years of experience
that tells me that putting that drain back in right now
could actually put him at more risk for infection .
12 years , i &apos;ve been here-- 12 years .
now you residents , you come and go ,
but this is my home , and you are my guest .
and right now , you are no longer welcome .
what &apos;s the emergency ?
oh , uh , i need a favor .
a nurse hates me .
you &apos;re a resident .
i &apos;m sure all the nurses hate you .
yes , well , they love you .
i think you love me .
fine . okay . whatever .
can you please just talk to him ,
smooth things over , so that when i go to take
my patient back to radiology and get his drain put back in ,
he doesn &apos;t make a scene ?
fine . i &apos;ll talk to him .
but you gotta meet me at joe &apos;s tonight for a drink .
you are unbelievable .
that &apos;s why you love me , &apos; cause i &apos;m unbelievable .
you and i , we don &apos;t work , okay ?
we @-@ we &apos;ve been through this .
one drink .
fine . one drink .
oh , god . okay , there he is .
eli ?
e--
two drinks .
fine .
fine . stay here .
eli .
yeah .
you got a second ?
oh , listen , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on here ,
but i know better than to mess with you on your turf ,
so do me a solid .
nod , act as if we &apos;re having a big debate here ,
&apos;cause dr. grey over there ,
she agreed to go out with me if i talk to you .
she &apos;s bossy .
i know . i dig it .
mm . what &apos;s in it for me ?
seahawks , sunday , box seats .
parking ?
of course .
mm @-@ hmm . okay .
unless dr. bailey herself orders that drain put back in ,
i--
now mention how highly i think of her .
i don &apos;t care if you think
dr. grey is the best resident
you &apos;ve ever seen come through this program .
mm @-@ hmm . i understand .
and i respect that . thank you .
yeah .
well , i did what i could . what time do you get off ?
what ? ! that &apos;s it . you didn &apos;t do anything .
see you tonight .
you &apos;re going out with sloan tonight ?
one drink , and then you are gonna interrupt us
and tell me that there &apos;s a medical emergency .
well , there might be a medical emergency
if you don &apos;t get that drain back in your guy .
i &apos;m just sayin &apos; , i guess you can observe
when i &apos;m taking out that gallbladder
through a dude &apos;s mouth .
dr. hunt , i updated mrs. paiz and
and checked your calls .
uh , dr. marshall from n.y.u. called
about speaking at their conference ,
and the lab called with results for your kidney patient .
that it ? n- nothing from my wife ?
no , that &apos;s it .
you ready ?
lifting the liver .
dr. miller can &apos;t fit ron in for three weeks ,
and we called our daughter in sarasota ,
and she said maybe we should wait ,
but ron wants it , and i @-@ i just want what ron wants ,
so , um , tell her , ron ,
tell her we want this 2 : 00 slot .
oh , yeah , i wish i could ,
but i &apos;m-- i &apos;m already booked .
no-- no , you &apos;re not .
yeah , i am . yeah . i have that , um ...
fused knee thing .
right , right , the guy with the knee .
yeah . you know , let me see if i can , uh ,
switch some things around .
i &apos;d really appreciate it .
oh , what if i push that down to later ?
no , you &apos;re geting that award tonight .
you can &apos;t miss that .
oh , that &apos;s right .
shoot .
okay , you know what ?
i &apos;ll do ron , and then i &apos;ll just be late for the dinner .
i am so sick of those awards dinners anyway .
it &apos;s like ... waka , waka , waka .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
thanks .
eli .
dr. bailey , have i told you lately
how much i like your eyes ?
d-- i am not in the mood . why did you remove the drain ?
because it was ready to be removed .
now i have to put the drain back in .
and write you up .
cause that-- you said you were gonna write-- write him up .
let me handle this , grey .
okay , mr. rabb is not sleeping , doctor .
that &apos;s a problem bec
okay , i feel for him ,
but this protocol isn &apos;t just about him .
i don &apos;t do protocols . i treat patients .
eli , save your high @-@ and @-@ mighty routine for someone else .
now i &apos;m sick of all of these post @-@ op complications .
i hate post @-@ op complications more than you do , dr. bailey .
i do . they &apos;re time consuming . they &apos;re messy .
they make it difficult for me to check up
on my fantasy football team as often as i &apos;d like ,
so i make sure that my patients don &apos;t get them .
i mean , you know you &apos;re happy when i &apos;m working .
and it &apos;s not just because of my pretty face .
it &apos;s &apos; cause i &apos;m good at what i do .
well , think about it . when &apos;s the last time you had
a post @-@ op complication with one of my patients ? hmm ?
good work .
i think i can get another stitch in .
we can &apos;t risk it . there &apos;s too much pull on the liver .
i &apos;m lowering it .
i want to try .
no .
there &apos;s not as much blood in the field as before .
he can handle another stitch .
remove your hand , dr.grey.
just another second .
don &apos;t--
done . i got it . i-- lower the liver .
get out of my o.r.
what ? i did it . look . see ? he &apos;s fine .
i &apos;m not gonna say it again .
no , i just got kicked out of the o.r.
because i &apos;m just so sick of all of this .
i &apos;m sick of her not talking to me .
i &apos;m sick of you two pretending to be friends .
so put her on the phone .
well , thank you , dr.keller. i think you did the right thing ,
coiling the aneurysm rather than clipping it .
thank you for the update ,
and i will check in with you later .
was that meredith ?
no .
yes .
oh , my god ! oh , my god ! i think i have a bite .
oh , my god ! what do i-- what do i do ? what do i do ? !
oh , my god ! what do i do ? !
stay calm . stay calm . sit down . sit down .
oh , my god ! oh , my god . okay ,
okay . i &apos;m sitting down .
all right , good .
i didn &apos;t read the part where you--
what-- what to do when you catch a fish .
okay , let it run for a second .
what does that mean ? !
what does that mean ? !
stay right there . sit down .
okay , okay . let it-- let the fish run a little .
let it-- let it--okay , go . go , go , go , go , go , go ,
give it some-- just give it some-- there it is .
okay , okay . now what ?
give it some line .
let it go . easy . let it--
yes . let it tire itself out .
okay . easy . now reel it in .
reeling it in . okay . good , good . good , good .
see , you &apos;re fishing .
oh , my god . oh , my god ! oh , my god ! i &apos;m fishing !
i &apos;m fishing ! aah !
you &apos;re fishing . whoa !
okay .
you &apos;re good .
yeah , well , tell that to stark .
stark ? please . you don &apos;t need stark .
you know why ?
in a year , everyone &apos;s gonna want this surgery ...
except there &apos;s only one of me .
unless ... i create another me .
that could be you--
the guy me .
not as pretty , not as good , but close .
i could teach you if you want .
screw stark .
stark &apos;s loss is my gain .
okay , ron , here comes your new hip .
could i talk to you for a second ?
uh , guys , give us the room .
yes , doctor .
i knew what i was doing .
i knew i could do that second stitch .
and you knew i could do that second stitch .
and if it were anyone else , you would &apos;ve let them do it .
but because i question how you handle cristina
you chose to slap me down
and let everybody know who &apos;s boss .
you want to know what i think ?
i think you &apos;re reckless .
i think you &apos;re reckless with your own life ,
and today , you were reckless with the patient &apos;s life .
and i don &apos;t care who you are , i don &apos;t want that in my o.r. ,
and i do not want that around my wife ,
who is struggling just to hold on .
your wife is struggling just to hold on
because you married her
and let it be okay for her to completely fall apart .
what is cristina gonna do when she gets back
from her fishing trip tonight ,
tomorrow , next week , next month , next year ?
because we &apos;ll all be here working ,
and cristina will be ... where ?
i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t know , but she has the right to figure that out .
you don &apos;t know . well , i know ,
because i know cristina yang .
and she needs to work ,
because surgery is who we are .
you told a guy with a gun to shoot you .
that is who you are .
what the hell does that have to do wi--
you-- you are fearless , and i don &apos;t mean that in a good way .
most people don &apos;t tell the guy with the gun to shoot them .
most people are like cristina . most people are afraid .
so what she needs isn &apos;t what you need .
she isn &apos;t you ...
meredith .
well , he &apos;s right .
his patient records for the past three months
show a post @-@ op complication rate way lower than the norm .
wait , 12 % compared to 42 % ?
wow .
okay , can you two stop being impressed by him ?
it &apos;s a fluke . he &apos;s mean .
hand me those charts .
i think he &apos;s kinda hot .
can you say that about a nurse ?
no .
oh . day three .
day ...
three .
day three .
yeah ? what ?
day three ?
oh . oh , oh , oh , okay , deep-- deep breaths .
deep breaths .
dr. bailey ?
ooh , yes . okay . okay .
okay , should we be following her ?
a medicalert bracelet ?
that &apos;s your solution ?
if the patient has a hypertensive crisis--
when ... when he has a hypertensive crisis ...
the paramedics will bring mr. burton here ,
and we &apos;ll treat his emergent condition .
yeah . that will be too late , he will be dead .
so you &apos;re sending him home to die ,
but you &apos;re okay with it because you &apos;re giving him
a bracelet with his name on it .
um , if we remove the drain on day three instead of day five ,
we can reduce the formation of fistulas by 30 % .
see , uh , eli took out a drain when he wasn &apos;t supposed to ,
and i was gonna write him up because he can &apos;t do that ,
but he did .
uh , i &apos;m going to leave the files for you to look at .
oh . uh-- oh , i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m ... miranda bailey--
the doctor who cured fistula .
that &apos;s right . i said it .
uh , jonas salk-- he cured polio .
miranda bailey is going to cure fistula .
th @-@ th @-@ three . day three .
28 ... pounds .
that &apos;s one of the biggest we &apos;ve had this year .
ah , look at that .
wow . nice fish .
thanks .
you want a picture ?
oh , definitely . definitely . take a picture . come on .
let &apos;s take a picture .
all right . you pick it up ,
i &apos;ll get the camera .
oh , my god . how am i supposed to pick it up ?
you just pick it up and take it off . you can .
it &apos;s very slippery , so be careful .
oh , my god . oh , my god ! oh , my god ! oh , my god !
hold it up like that . all right ?
ready ? great .
yes , yes . oh , god .
oh , my god . it &apos;s totally heavy .
okay , ready ?
your friend &apos;s first time out , huh ?
yeah , first time .
yeah , she really is something .
yes , she is . she really is .
okay . smile now .
well , that &apos;s okay . we don &apos;t need a picture .
take it .
let &apos;s wait till she &apos;s--
take it now . we &apos;re gonna want to remember this .
oh , my god .
jason , honey .
we were able to repair the damage ,
but the next 24 hours are crucial .
but he can recover , right ?
if-- if everything goes okay , he &apos;ll fully recover ?
we &apos;re just focusing on getting jason through the night .
i know it &apos;s hard ,
but try not to think too far into the future .
i &apos;m afraid to touch him .
i know right now all you can see
are the machines and the damage ,
but he &apos;s still there .
hey , there &apos;s my star resident .
come on . we &apos;re drinking . i &apos;m buying .
oh , dude . sorry , i can &apos;t .
why not ?
stark ended up hating the guy
who assisted him today
even more than hates me .
oh , god .
anyway , there &apos;s a midgut volvulus , and i &apos;m gonna assist .
you &apos;re going back to stark ?
i mean , the guy &apos;s a douche ,
and-- and hips are cool ,
but you know--
just go .
i &apos;m still awesome .
i &apos;ve prescribed alpha blockers
and set you up in our free clinic .
you need anything at all ... call me .
we &apos;re gonna see you through this .
thank you .
hey .
i tried . i &apos;m sorry . i , uh--
i &apos;ll be okay .
dr. webber slipped me some free samples ,
so i &apos;m good for a while .
good . good .
well , good luck .
i have great medical insurance .
way to kick a guy when he &apos;s down .
i &apos;m saying , i &apos;m-- i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m saying that i &apos;ll marry you .
that &apos;s a really generous offer .
but i can &apos;t .
i &apos;m a doctor .
i took an oath ,
and i can &apos;t leave you now
any more than i could leave you bleeding out in the street .
this is absurd .
you &apos;re aware of that ?
and you &apos;re gonna regret it deeply in the morning .
you &apos;re dying .
henry , you &apos;re dying ,
and you don &apos;t have to , &apos; cause i can help .
i mean it .
i &apos;ll marry you .
i want all post @-@ op drains
removed on day three from now on
unless i tell you otherwise .
do u know what this means , what you did ?
what ? what ?
i was wondering if you wanted
to go out with me sometime , dr. bailey .
i mean , even that shocked ,
&quot; oh , my god a nurse just asked me out .
how the hell do i get out of it ? &quot; expression
you got on right now is pretty cute .
fine ,
because you gave me day three .
and because i &apos;m very handsome .
yeah .
i know i agreed to have a drink with you .
but as i walked here ,
i realized how unfair that was .
you know , it &apos;s-- it &apos;s-- it &apos;s unfair to you ,
it &apos;s unfair to me , because ...
really , nothing has changed .
i- i mean , you &apos;re-- you &apos;re still
in a very different place in your life than i am ,
and-- and you want different--
the goal of any surgery is total recovery ...
to come out better than you were before .
some patients heal quickly and feel immediate relief .
oh , lexie . i just got a page .
bailey wants us back in the i.c.u.
can you deal with it , please ?
hey .
hey .
i have 21 pounds of trout .
how was it ?
it was good .
for others the healing happens gradually .
and it &apos;s not until months or even years later
that you realize ,
you don &apos;t hurt anymore .
do you think cristina &apos;s gonna be okay ?
mm . yeah , i do .
do you think she &apos;s gonna be a surgeon ?
honestly ?
i don &apos;t know .
so the challenge after any surgery is to be patient .
mark , did you forget your keys ?
okay , so picture this--
i &apos;m in africa , and everything &apos;s great ,
and the people are so nice , and the clinic is amazing ,
and i &apos;m doing work that actually feels important .
like , i can ...
i can actually see that i &apos;m making a difference ,
but i &apos;m crying , like , constantly .
and then this guy that work with at the clinic
finally asks me what &apos;s wrong ,
and i say that i miss my girlfriend ,
like-- like , i really miss her . so then he asks me
if i want to go back if they could replace me .
and-- and then i open my mouth to say &quot; no ... &quot;
but what comes out weirdly instead is &quot; yes . &quot;
and so they did .
and then i came back .
you look really pretty .
but if you can make it through
the first weeks and months ...
if you believe that healing is possible ...
then you can get your life back .
but that &apos;s a big if .
