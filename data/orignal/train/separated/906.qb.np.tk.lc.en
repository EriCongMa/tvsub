back in the day ,
winter break was my favorite time of year .
the hot cocoa , the gift @-@ wrapping ,
the taste of buttery popcorn
as you watched your favorite holiday movie .
for me and my big bro , it was &quot; a christmas story . &quot;
for some reason , it just spoke to us .
the sox traded bullfrog , the only player they got ,
for shottenhoffen .
the phils are trading ryne sandberg for larry bowa !
it &apos;s ludicrous !
ralphie ! on the double !
everybody get your asses in here !
we didn &apos;t do christmas , but we had hanukkah .
and that meant lots of forced family time
and eastern european foods .
what &apos;s that smell ?
lucky , not cool !
but it wasn &apos;t the dog . it was this .
stuffed cabbage time !
let &apos;s go ! it &apos;s freakin &apos; hanukkah !
again ? didn &apos;t we just do that ?
yeah , last year . go set the table .
a lot of people think that because there are eight nights of hanukkah ,
you get eight awesome presents .
truth is , they were mostly filler .
shoelaces .
batteries .
underpants .
i got to go . i got a thing .
as the days stretched on , so were the limits
of what was considered a present .
school supplies .
raisins .
underpants .
i got to go . i got a thing .
by night 8 , it was straight @-@ up bottom of the barrel .
toothbrush .
zit cream ?
more underpants ? !
what is the deal , people ? !
zit cream isn &apos;t a gift ! it &apos;s an insult !
i &apos;m gonna go . i got a --
thing . we know . you &apos;ve got a thing .
and your new underpants are a gift for me , barry .
even if we didn &apos;t have the holiday spirit ,
we tried our best to make it fun .
what the hell happened to all the sour cream ?
adam dared me .
i ate it , along with the rest of the condiments .
in your face , mustards and jams !
what is the one rule we have in this house , huh ?
no daring barry to do stupid stuff .
why ?
&apos;cause i have no regard for my personal well @-@ being .
frankly , for us , it wasn &apos;t the most joyous holiday ,
especially after visiting the christmas wonderland
at the kremps &apos; .
daisy , it &apos;s the goldbergs !
hello , goldbergs .
we &apos;ve been expecting you !
merry chris-- holiday .
winter fest .
welcome !
oh , uh , charles is out back
splitting wood for the yule fire .
do you want to give him a hand , murray ?
he &apos;s good . i believe in him .
can i wet your whistle with some eggnog ?
don &apos;t forget your cinnamon stick .
be careful -- scott is our college boy ,
and he makes a strong nog .
mom ? did you finally give me that b.b. gun i always wanted ?
oh , this is a snare drum , isn &apos;t it ? !
i told you -- no peeking , okay ?
i want the two of you back to icing that gingerbread house .
chad , put down the snare drum .
i knew it !
he gets me every year .
okay , what are my eyes looking at ?
nothing . they &apos;re just excited for kremp christmas .
but why are your kids here , willingly participating ?
what else are they gonna do ?
seriously ?
you mean to tell me you &apos;re that good at family ?
good at family ? that &apos;s not a saying .
oh , it &apos;s a saying , and you are good at family .
you are good at family .
we &apos;re fine at family .
you &apos;re fab at family .
we &apos;re not .
it &apos;s been fun . it has .
let &apos;s do it again sometime .
uh , but let &apos;s not make a plan . we &apos;ll wing it .
oh , murray , before you go ,
i have the teensiest of favors to ask you .
our santa fell through this year ,
and it would just mean the world to us
if you could just pop over and hand out some gifts .
thank you so much for thinking of him .
he &apos;d love to .
murray , you &apos;ll put on the suit .
or ...
it was december 23 , 1980 @-@ something --
christmas vacation .
that meant my brother &apos;s dopey friends were out of town ,
and i was his only playmate .
the alone time with barry was awesome !
it &apos;s how we came up with
our favorite brotherly game -- ball ball .
there were hundreds of rules , but the most important
was every time you took a shot , you had to yell ...
ball ball !
ball ball !
ball ball !
nine points .
i win . suck it !
looks like the trophy is mine .
damn it ! you cheated ! rematch !
it was days and days of bro @-@ ing out with barry .
you ready , barry ?
you better be , &apos; cause we &apos;re about to play some --
ball ball !
ball ball !
ball ball !
yes ! 10 points .
what the hell is this ?
it &apos;s called ball ball .
it &apos;s this awesome game where you throw the ball back and forth .
i &apos;m familiar with the game .
i helped invent it .
i added the second &quot; ball . &quot;
and i &apos;m the official world champion .
yeah , we don &apos;t recognize that federation anymore .
lainey and i now play for champion of the universe !
i didn &apos;t ratify these changes .
adam , it &apos;s fine . you can play .
no ! the ball ball he knew is over .
plus , i wouldn &apos;t even be able to explain
all the changes we made in the past 10 minutes .
whatever .
enjoy your stupid game .
while i was losing barry ,
my mom was gonna win over our family with a new holiday plan .
big news , everyone .
this family &apos;s about to experience some exciting changes
this holiday season .
if it costs me money , it ain &apos;t happening .
it &apos;ll actually save you money .
it &apos;s happening .
... in the long run .
in the short run , it &apos;ll cost way more .
i just got back from the kremps &apos; , and guess what .
there are people out there who actually enjoy
celebrating the holidays together .
turns out , it &apos;s not that we &apos;re not good at family .
it &apos;s just that we &apos;ve been doing it all wrong .
so this year , we &apos;re gonna spice things up
with a little celebration i like to call ...
super hanukkah ! !
mama &apos;s jazzed , and here &apos;s why .
we &apos;re gonna make hanukkah sizzle and pop !
we &apos;re gonna decorate the house .
we &apos;re gonna drink buttery booze milk
and put all our gifts under a festive topiary together
as one big family .
so , like a ... christmas tree ?
no ! a hanukkah bush !
and instead of opening presents on eight separate nights ,
we &apos;re gonna save &apos; em up and open &apos; em all on one night !
or one morning .
so , like ... christmas morning ?
no -- super hanukkah morning .
but you better not be naughty ,
or else you @-@ know @-@ who won &apos;t bring you any presents .
santa claus !
no ! hanukkah harry .
the jon lovitz character from &quot; saturday night live &quot; ?
actually , he &apos;s based on a real person .
don &apos;t look it up ! who has the time ?
just ... trust me on this .
well , i &apos;m all for getting this over with in one night .
that &apos;s the super hanukkah spirit !
and here &apos;s a box of lights for you to string up on the house .
this has now become work .
not work -- fun .
just like the kremps have .
now get to work .
i mean &quot; fun &quot; !
and so my mom finally got
the hanukkah she always wanted --
christmas .
do it with care .
one that would rival the kremps &apos; .
before we knew it ,
we &apos;d all been swept up in the super hanukkah spirit .
and for the first time ever ,
our house wasn &apos;t the only one on the block
that didn &apos;t have festive lights .
three ... two ... one .
yeah , baby !
looks expensive .
it is ! super hanukkah !
oh my god !
it &apos;s like i gave you a list of stuff i wanted
and you actually bought it !
well , you made the list . i checked it twice .
no socks . no raisins .
no underpants .
every gift under the bush is better than the last !
there &apos;s more where that came from .
this bad boy &apos;s from me .
that &apos;s an officially licensed key chain .
very rare .
stop speaking your stupid words .
behold the gift lainey got me -- an eagles jersey !
my dad re @-@ tiled their training facility .
but the best part ...
the whole team signed it !
but the limit was $ 10 !
oh , it &apos;s cool . i got it for free .
i love you so much right now .
this is the holiday of my dreams ,
and i don &apos;t ever want it to end -- ever !
ever !
what the hell is this ?
super hanukkah !
and what is this music ?
neil diamond -- the voice of our people .
it &apos;s a christmas song !
my god ! is that a christmas tree ?
no , it &apos;s a hanukkah bush .
that &apos;s not a thing . a--
oh , my lord .
did you hang stockings by the chimney with care ?
not stockings -- hanukkah socks .
ma , we &apos;re running out of candy canes .
not candy canes --
peppermint j &apos;s .
can i wet your whistle with some hanu @-@ nog ?
no !
dad , i &apos;m just trying to spice it up ,
like the kremps do .
they &apos;re good at family , and now so are we .
trading in your family &apos;s tradition
is not being good at family .
i mean , what &apos;s next ? santa claus .
i did the thing for the blond neighbor people .
no more .
understand ? no more !
and just when pops thought it couldn &apos;t get any worse ...
hello !
i brought you some decorations .
oh , my ! oh , my .
your holiday is just so much more vibrant than i remember .
well , we kicked it up a notch .
no ! hanukkah only has one notch .
look at this !
that &apos;s our hanukkah bush .
you know , i never knew that there were so many similarities
between our two holidays .
what is the story behind the hanukkah bush , anyway ?
yeah , bevy . what is the story ?
i mean , obviously , there &apos;s a rich cultural significance .
otherwise , why would you do this to me ?
well , the maccabees only had enough oil for one night ,
and it was a miracle .
and another miracle ...
was the finding of the bush in the temple basement .
and they decorated it with ... festive tchotchkes .
so interesting .
where &apos;d they find the tchotchkes ?
in their pockets .
tchotchke pockets . they were potchkes .
you forgot the part where aquaman swam to egypt
and parted the red sea with his fish friends
and moses the porpoise .
okay , that &apos;s enough . you &apos;re being ridiculous .
i &apos;m ridiculous ? !
i &apos;ll show you who &apos;s ridiculous .
you &apos;ll see .
you &apos;ll see !
well , that was the traditional re @-@ enactment
of the storming out of the land of egypt ...
by aquaman .
as the holiday break war on ,
lainey continued to edge me out
of my holiday traditions with barry .
she even edged me off the couch .
stop shifting in the beanbag .
lainey and i are trying to watch our favorite movie here .
your favorite movie ? !
it &apos;s supposed to be our favorite movie .
well , it &apos;s been re @-@ favorited .
that &apos;s not even a word .
there &apos;s no way to know .
you know what ? fudge both you guys !
and you &apos;ve seen the movie , so you know what that means !
dude , wait . what &apos;s your deal ?
did i do something wrong ?
oh , look at you , acting all foxy and innocent .
i &apos;m onto you , lady .
what are you talking about ?
this is the only time all year
that barry &apos;s actually nice to me .
but then you crashed our movie and stole ball ball
and ruined everything .
i didn &apos;t mean to , okay ?
i &apos;d never get between two brothers .
again . it happened once at summer camp .
there were these hot twins , and --
it &apos;s not important .
i &apos;ll just give you and barry some time alone .
y @-@ you &apos;d do that for me ?
of course .
i think it &apos;s really cute that you love your big brother .
i &apos;d never get in the way of that .
have fun with barry . tell him i &apos;ll see him tomorrow .
thanks for being so curvy and understanding .
hey , no problem .
wait -- what ?
nothing ! see ya .
guess who made caramel corn .
move ! that seat is saved for laineys only .
actually , she had to bail ,
but now we get to watch &quot; a christmas story &quot; together ,
like we always do .
nyeh . i &apos;ve seen it a billion times .
wait ! wait ! where you going ?
lainey &apos;s . i miss her laugh .
that &apos;s very sweet and angering !
see ? you get it . bye , nerd .
don &apos;t leave me ! come back !
in that moment , i decided to get barry to stay
by breaking the one cardinal rule in our house --
never dare barry goldberg .
wait !
you could go see lainey ,
or you could accept my double dog dare .
tell me what it is , and i &apos;ll do it right now .
i don &apos;t know .
you &apos;ll be way too afraid of this one .
impossible ! i was born without the fear gene .
it &apos;s a medical miracle . ask any doctor .
okay . it &apos;s on .
grab your jacket .
dare complete . i win .
yeah , that &apos;s not the dare .
follow me to the tetherball pole .
while i was trying to spend time with my brother ,
my mom was having the time of her life
with her made @-@ up holiday .
lucky ! stop it !
hey , honey .
have you been wearing that santa suit all day ?
oh , yeah .
turns out these pants keep the fellas warm and toasty .
and the girl at wawa -- she gave me a free lotto ticket .
people love santa claus !
who knew ?
i think everyone .
and a merry hanukkah to you and yours !
dad , what are you doing ?
what &apos;s it look like ?
i &apos;m handing out goodies for the holiday .
if you &apos;re trying to be hanukkah harry
to rub it in my face , you &apos;ve got it all wrong .
no . i &apos;m hanu @-@ claus .
i &apos;m mashing two words together to make one offensive one ,
just like you do .
now , who wants presents ?
me , hanu @-@ claus !
then prepare yourselves
as i dole out gifts from my sack of shame .
no ! guilt has no place in our people &apos;s holiday .
shame on you . i hope you feel guilty .
look ! it &apos;s your great @-@ grandpa samuel solomon .
he crossed poland with $ 2 in his shoe
so his traditions could live on here in america --
only for you to dismantle his dream .
fun !
i don &apos;t like hanu @-@ claus .
and what &apos;s this ?
this jar stores all the traditions
you &apos;ve passed down to your children .
but it &apos;s empty .
and look !
why , it &apos;s a button -- from the sweatshop
your grandmother worked in to put food on our table ,
even though we didn &apos;t have a table .
you had a table , al .
it wobbled !
my god .
there &apos;s like 20 more super @-@ sad things in here .
and we &apos;re going through them all --
every last depressing one of them .
fun !
as pops was trying to put an end to my mom &apos;s new traditions ,
i was trying to get back at barry for ruining ours .
go on . do it already .
oh , i will do it .
i &apos;ve stuck my tongue to tons of different things .
you &apos;re stalling .
come on .
i triple dog dare you .
there it was , the coup de grace of all dares --
the sinister triple dog dare .
barry had no choice but to accept .
no fear !
that &apos;s right .
you ain &apos;t going nowhere , bro .
you &apos;ve been ignoring me all week , but no more !
looks like you &apos;ll be hanging out with your little brother ,
like it or not .
really ?
original version ?
as barry and i were airing our grievances ,
pops had decided to sing his .
on the fifth day of hanukkah , my daughter said to me
five backs a @-@ stabbing
four neglected customs
three sellout children
two shameful parents
and she spit in my face , too
put down the banjo , dad . we get the point .
o hanukkah bush , o hanukkah bush
you crap all over our culture
everyone !
okay , this was fun for a bit ,
and then it got sad , and now it &apos;s just bonkers .
give it to me . give me the banjo .
no !
just give her the banjo , al !
no !
give it !
give her the damn banjo , al !
give it !
watch the candles !
my hanukkah tree !
my ... christmas bush ! whatever !
murray , do something !
move !
are you happy now ?
you ruined super hanukkah !
how can i ruin something that &apos;s not even real ?
interesting tradition there .
can we come over and hear all about it ?
what exactly does all this symbolize ?
we suck at family , okay ? is that what you want to hear ?
you don &apos;t suck at all , but we do .
we , like ... suck butt ... at family .
the big suck .
yeah !
we do .
it was hour two on the pole .
it was freezing , but nothing could thaw
the tension between me and barry .
i &apos;ve raised morons .
that &apos;s the thing about family .
even though you my not say it clearly ,
you know in your heart
they &apos;ll always be there for you .
there any room for me ?
of course .
and sometimes you just have to accept
that there &apos;s enough love to go around .
you guys have some good brother time ?
it was all right .
&apos;cause being good at family wasnt &apos; about
making the old holiday sizzle and pop .
it was about remembering
why the holiday was important in the first place .
hey , dad .
what you got there ?
mom &apos;s locket .
never saw this picture of me and her before .
she looks ... so happy .
oh , she was .
it was your first hanukkah .
meant the world to her .
dad , i &apos;m sorry . i guess i just got carried away .
i think it &apos;s safe to say we both did .
all i wanted was to be good at family , you know ?
and you are , bev .
but part of being good at family
is knowing where you came from .
thanks , dad .
ginzy ? you okay ?
yeah .
yeah , all good .
even though everything &apos;s poop .
it &apos;s all poop , bev -- all of it .
what are you talking about ?
you &apos;re good at family ! remember ?
are you kidding ?
scott gave daisy some nog .
now i have to get my rugs cleaned .
steve shot drew with the stupid b.b. gun ,
and charles burnt the ham .
now we don &apos;t even have christmas dinner .
in that moment , my mom realized
the kremps were no better at family than us
and there was no such thing as a perfect holiday .
come with me .
i know a place .
who even knew restaurants were open today ?
we knew .
chinese on christmas -- it &apos;s kind of our thing .
learn something new every day , right ?
sure do .
so , this was our christmas story .
it for sure doesn &apos;t look like yours ,
but it &apos;s not about how or what you celebrate .
it &apos;s who you celebrate with .
and , yeah , ours was crazy .
oh , geez !
but it was awesome .
that &apos;s a great present .
chet , what do you have there ? what is that ?
let me look .
dude , check this out !
sit ! sit !
you want to have your christmas present ?
a card !
thank you !
it &apos;s the eighth day of hanukkah .
figure i &apos;d save the best for last .
well , i love it .
but you know what present i &apos;d really love ?
a snuggie from my biggest boy .
yeah , not gonna happen .
not even if i dare you ?
oh , god . don &apos;t do this .
triple dog dare !
you &apos;ll regret ever challenging me .
take these snuggies !
take &apos; em !
barry wins at everything .
that &apos;s right , honey . you win .
barry wins at everything !
