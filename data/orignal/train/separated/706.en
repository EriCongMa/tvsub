David!
So you never looked at Porter for the murder, huh?
He was in with Reyes and me when Grayson got whacked.
I knew you'd have questions about Amanda.
Did you give her the money?
I gave her everything.
I want to do something for David --
Something that might give you
a way around Victoria's media blackout.
I have found a way
to put your father's scandal behind you.
That's the deed to your beach house.
What are you doing?
Atoning for my father's sins.
Give me exclusive rights to David's story.
Provided you give us final approval on all stories.
And for a minute, I thought I could be
the guy I was with you yesterday, but...
We keep things strictly professional.
Please connect me to Page Six.
I have a story about Daniel Grayson.
Never thought I'd be going home with Charlotte Grayson.
It's "Clarke."
My mistake.
When are you gonna tell him?
When he's ready.
Daddy! Daddy!
Look what you found.
But he's missing an arm.
Yeah, but he's got four more.
You know what's cool? He's gonna grow that one back.
But first, he has to go back home.
Hey! I wanted to watch it grow!
Oh, yeah, but that takes a long time
and a lot of saltwater.
Okay, that's it. Come on!
Good morning.
Vince?
There you are.
Hey, where's all my stuff?
Make yourself comfortable.
No, I-I got to get home.
I know this must be confusing, especially after last night.
I usually don't sleep with the bait, but...
how could I resist?
The bait? Bait for what?
A fish I've been after for a very long time.
Good morning.
I bet the ocean is happy to have you back in her arms.
You got my message.
How was your first night here?
Surreal.
Almost like nothing had changed.
You know, after your arrest,
I held on to this place for years.
I used to come and stay here for hours
and imagine myself here with you.
I always was too sentimental.
I've arranged for the tailor to come for a fitting later.
Tv crew comes at 4:00.
Can't believe you set this up so quickly.
Well, Margaux is a very close friend.
You can't underestimate the hunger of the audience to know your story.
David.
Are you sure you want to tell it?
I need to set the record straight.
There's people out there that still think I'm a terrorist.
Right.
They need to see that I was a victim,
that I was betrayed.
Yeah.
Well, maybe we should go over some talking points.
There will be millions watching, and --
Well, that's the good thing about the truth --
You don't need talking points.
I'll see you tonight.
Hacking into the FBI
should get harder as I get older, but...
Nope.
Wham, bam, thanks, Uncle Sam.
Would you do if your bestie wasn't a keyboard cowboy,
besides, well, actually talk to your father?
I told you, I'm giving him space.
And downloading his confidential psychiatric assessment
isn't an invasion of said space?
I want to help him, and in order to do that,
I need to know what he's been through.
You should have seen his wounds, Nolan.
You mean these?
It says these bastards whipped him with chains.
Let's see the interview.
I can barely stomach this, Ems.
I don't think we should watch this video.
No, I need to know what happened.
And I want to hear it from him.
Well, then, let it play.
Please.
You can't do this to me. I'm only 19.
I'm just starting my life.
I just got my father back.
Please.
I know what you're trying to do here --
Spout off a bunch of personal details,
make yourself seem like a real person.
It's not gonna work.
Where was this enthusiasm last night?
Go ahead, kid.
Let's see if you can get it.
Bitch!
Oh, my God.
While you were incarcerated,
would you say your primary emotion was fear?
Anger? Helplessness?
Fear, at first...
That I wouldn't see the sun again or...
That I wouldn't be able to surve the torture.
Then, over time, I would stop feeling.
And now, since you've been out?
I know that I'm supposed to feel relieved and thankful.
But I'm -- I don't.
I feel more alone out here than I ever felt in there.
Have you found yourself prone to mood swings,
violent impulses?
Thank you for your time. We're done.
So, what was his diagnosis?
Complex PTSD.
"Psychological fragmentation,
a loss of a sense of safety and trust."
What else does it say?
What else are you looking for?
I just feel like there's more to the story.
It's all right here.
FBI tends to be pretty thorough.
I don't know. It's just...
It's a gut instinct, Nolan.
I can't explain it.
Well, maybe his interview tonight will.
If he's hiding something from the FBI,
he's not gonna announce it to the whole world on live television.
Ems, I respect your instinct,
but I think you're looking for an easier answer.
'Cause the truth is anything but.
It's hard to accept that this happened to someone that we loved.
But it did.
So, I assume you saw Page Six.
Oh, no. What have I done now?
They ran a story on you and one Miss Louise Ellis.
They ran a what?
Quite the little sexpot, isn't she?
Oh, God.
No, it's good news.
"Louise Ellis lands in New York
and hires Daniel Grayson to manage her millions."
Seems like you're back in the game, big boy.
How's, uh, how's the interview coming together?
Rapidly.
I have one last call to make to our station director in Tokyo,
and then I can finally catch my breath.
Join me for some tennis later?
No, I can't.
A realtor's showing me some office spaces.
Thanks to your beach-house P.R. Stunt,
my phone's been ringing off the hook.
When it rains. à bient?t.
Ciao.
Was that Margaux?
Oh, my God.
How the hell did you get in here?
I'm your mother --
a fact that you don't respect, but your doorman does.
I was hoping to catch Margaux here.
It's urgent.
So is your boyfriend's interview that she's busy setting up.
Yes, well, it's related.
I'm worried.
David has been acting very strange with me lately,
And I --
What is this?
What are you doing with Louise Ellis?
What's it to you?
This girl is mentally imbalanced.
So she's a friend of yours.
I am serious, Daniel.
When I disappeared after Pascal's death,
I'd fallen apart, and I needed help,
so I checked in to a psychiatric hospital.
Hold on a second.
That's where you were all that time?
Why didn't you tell me?
I couldn't bear for you to see my life in shambles.
In there, Louise was my roommate.
And now that she's hired you,
I'm highly suspect of her intentions.
Look, even if Louise isn't stable,
her bank accounts certainly are.
Believe me. I can handle her.
You once said the exact same thing about Emily Thorne.
格雷森全球金融联系
大卫·克拉克被定罪
I hate to end on a low note,
but for those who knew
former officer Jim Mostrowski,
just got news he passed away.
Heart attack.
There is a wake at his house tonight.
You stop by if you can to pay your respects.
That's it. Stay safe.
Ready when you are.
Yeah, give me a sec.
Hey, Willard, hold up.
That's the same Mostrowski that moved up
to Fulton correctional, isn't it?
Is anyone looking into his death?
Considering --
Is this going where I think it's going?
No, I'm just saying, according to that case file,
Mostrowski beat up Conrad Grayson
right before Grayson was murdered.
The chief told you to drop this.
Besides, Mo was cleared.
Yeah, but now that he's showing up dead --
Yeah, from a heart attack.
Watch your partner, Porter.
Last week, he'd have given his left nut to pin this on you.
Jack. What?
Jack, wait up!
Porter, I know you're pissed.
Just give me a second to explain.
What the hell is wrong with you?
When did you start telling everyone at the station
you thought I was a murderer?
You're unbelievable.
Look, come on. I dropped it soon as
I found out that you had an alibi.
Oh, okay. Well, that makes me feel better.
Look, all I've ever wanted was to become a detective, all right?
Solving a cold case like this -- that would do that for me.
Do you really want to make your career this way?
Whoever killed Conrad deserves a medal.
And you wonder why I suspected you.
Come on. After everything you said he did to you,
your wife, your brother --
You telling me the thought of killing that bastard
never crossed your mind?
Even if it had, that's not the point.
You're a beat cop. You're not a detective.
And the chief told you to drop this,
so if you don't, it reflects badly on me, your partner.
So stop being a pain in the ass and find a new hobby
before you screw this job up for both of us.
Where is he?
His neck's broken.
Why didn't you call the police?
I was going to.
I was -- I was dialing them,
but then I-I didn't know what to make of all this.
He called me "Bait."
He was using me to get to our father.
But why?
Why would anyone want to hurt him?
Same make and model that tried to run down David the other day.
Oh, God. I should have just called the police.
But I called you as a last resort,
but he's our dad,
and I thought after everything you'd done to me, to our family,
I thought maybe you could help.
Based on this file,
it looks like he was one of the remaining
flight 197 fanatics who still doubted David's innocence.
This guy deserved what he got.
What drugs were you doing?
We were just drinking, maybe doing a little coke.
He offered me heroin, but I don't --
Perfect. We're gonna need it.
I don't think I will ever get used to seeing you at my door.
Come in.
Thank you.
You know, I've been thinking about what you told me --
that I shouldn't be so quick to trust just anyone.
You meant Victoria, right?
I know how you feel about the Graysons,
how you've always felt.
And now I know now what they did to you and your company.
I wish could have been there for you, Nolan,
the way you've always been there for me.
Which is why, if you can, I would --
I would like it if you came to the interview tonight.
I need someone on my side in case I get cornered.
Then I'll be there.
I'm proud of you, Nolan.
All your hard work -- it's paid off in spades.
I wouldn't have any of this
if you hadn't believed in me way back when.
But I did.
Victoria?
Oh, thanks so much for reaching out to me.
I read the blurb in page six.
How exciting -- you and my son working together.
I did it for you, you know.
I knew Daniel needed business, and,
well, I just wanted to repay you
for the kindness you showed me at Claremont.
Now, I know our time there was brief, but,
well, life is just a series of moments.
I was about to say the very same thing.
Oh, Louise, I'm so happy we met.
You've been a better child to me than my own blood, Louise.
My own blood.
Victoria.
Thank you so much for reaching out to me.
Please.
Ms. Grayson, your table is ready.
How perfect. I'm famished.
Actually, my lunch date is with someone else.
I'm rather short on time, but we're overdue for a chat.
I hear you'll be working with my son.
Now, of all the financial advisers in Manhattan,
how did that happen?
Well, it was practically your idea.
I never mentioned Daniel to you.
Well, no, but you did say
your family was struggling with finances.
If this is because I left you at Claremont --
Victoria, I told you.
I don't blame you for that.
I simply just want to repay the kindness
you showed me in there.
You were like a mother to me.
We were roommates for a day.
Well, sure, but...
...life is just a series of moments.
Whatever does that mean?
Louise, I don't wish to sound ungrateful,
but if your intentions toward my son
are anything other than honest,
well, I'm sure you know how terrifying
a mother's love for her children can be.
Do I ever.
Victoria, wait.
When can we see each other again?
I don't think that's a good idea.
And what's this?
It's a list of questions for the interviewer to ask.
Oh, my news division has already handled this.
Then I need your assurance that if anything goes wrong,
you'll cut the live feed.
And what exactly do you expect to go wrong, Victoria?
Or do we have an even bigger story than I thought?
Listen, I'm happy for you to be there,
but I won't tolerate any interference.
I'm planning to tell Nolan Ross the same.
What does Nolan have to do with this?
David requested his presence.
Let's go through this again.
He shot up.
Shortly after realizing he took too much,
he stumbled over here in an attempt to call 911.
Before he could, he collapsed,
breaking his neck when he fell.
Am I missing anything?
I cut him with the bottle.
No.
When he fell, he swiped the counter.
Bottle broke. Cut his hand.
I can't imagine what it's like being you.
I mean, I know this was all my fault,
but it was just a mistake.
I'm not a cold-blooded killer.
I've never killed anyone, Charlotte.
I know you hate me for the things that I've done,
but I've never done that.
Sadly, erasing every trace of myself is my expertise.
As your mother pointed out,
it's something I've done all too well,
which is why I can't see our father yet.
I think you're just ashamed.
God forbid he sees what you've become.
You know, for a while now,
I've given you the benefit of the doubt
because your parents did you no favors
by protecting you with lies.
But you're too old for excuses, Charlotte.
It's time you own your bad choices.
That could easily have been you lying there.
You only called me
because you wanted someone to come and save you.
But I can't do that.
You've hit rock bottom.
Only you can pull yourself out.
Aren't they gonna know that he died before he shot up?
It's true.
Drugs can't circulate once the heart stops.
But you don't need to be alive to circulate your blood.
Aiden died of an overdose.
Isn't that what the coroner said?
But he didn't, did he?
And you said you'd never killed anyone.
I haven't.
Your mother killed him.
Looking good out there.
And your swing ain't bad, either.
Oh, a few more weeks of practice,
and I'll be able to whip to the head.
Oh, hi, Daniel.
Oh! What a small world.
My partner didn't show, and, lucky for me,
your new client just joined the club.
I can see that.
You never told me how competitive this one is.
That's funny -- I thought
I'd told you all about Margaux.
I'm surprised to see you here.
I -- uh, you know, I had --
realtor was showing me some office space around the corner.
I thought I'd stop by
and wish you luck for the interview tonight.
Oh, yeah. I must be going.
I'm meeting the crew early to go over details.
A pleasure, Louise.
Next time, winner buys lunch?
Deal.
Bye.
Bye.
That little accent of hers
is about the cutest thing I've ever heard.
What are you doing?
Didn't know I played tennis, did you?
Hundreds of members at this club,
and you just happen to buddy up with my girlfriend?
That's quite a coincidence, wouldn't you say?
A completely innocent one.
I just signed up to be a sub, and she asked me to play.
Why didn't you tell me you
knew my mother from a psychiatric hospital?
Well, I didn't think your mother would want me to share that.
Come on.
People look at you differently when they know.
Kind of like the way you're looking at me right now.
Look, I'm sorry if I seem a little paranoid.
It just wouldn't be the first time
I'd been targeted by someone with a hidden agenda.
Oh, quit being such a worrywart, sugar.
This has nothing to do with you.
All right, three minutes to air, everyone.
Three minutes.
Uh, poor timing, Ems. Can't talk right now.
I'm upstate at the silo.
My hunch was right, Nolan.
There's more to my father's story than he's admitting.
I have a photo of him in public.
Like I said, not a good time.
He's in some kind of town square.
There's a bank sign behind him listing the date as March 15th,
but that doesn't match up to his story
that he's been imprisoned until last week.
And for all you know,
it was photoshopped by someone trying to make trouble.
Cops still have this place on lockdown.
I need you to hack into their radio frequencies --
have dispatch draw them out with an emergency.
I'm done investigating him, Ems.
It's time to come to terms with the truth
instead of making up your own.
I'm not making anything up, Nolan,
And I don't understand
why you're so unwilling to dig deeper.
Because David has been through enough.
He's about to go on live TV, and...
he needs my support.
Wait. Are you there with him?
Just because you're too afraid to reconnect with him
doesn't mean I have to be.
Just, uh, playing hardball with a business partner.
Ah. Same, old Nolan Ross.
Nolcorp may be a thing of the past,
but the new company is probably right around the corner.
I do have a few things percolating.
No doubt.
David, we need you to take your seat.
Glad you came. It means a lot.
Thanks.
You two seem rather close as of late.
We've always been close, Victoria.
Even when you left him to rot in prison,
I was still there for him.
See, you may be able to keep David away from Emily,
but that's obviously not gonna work with me.
Oh, well, I'm not trying to keep him from anyone.
I simply don't want him to say something he might regret.
Like what?
What, are you afraid I told my new friend
what a wretched woman you really are?
You two, you can take your places.
We're starting.
Oh, I just love live TV.
You never know what's gonna happen.
Okay, we are live in 30 seconds, people.
There. You're all set.
No matter what happens, I will always be on your side.
15 seconds.
Mrs. Grayson, we're gonna need you to move, please.
Quiet, everyone. Call it.
Okay, in 5, 4, 3...
Good evening.
We're here tonight to explore
one of the most controversial stories of our time.
David Clarke, welcome.
That partner of yours is still at it.
Hassling Mo's grieving daughter with questions.
I give him two more minutes
before she throws that drink in his face.
So, no anger issues or anything that,
that may have led to an altercation with one of the inmates?
Not that I know of.
Hi. We haven't met. I'm Jack Porter.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
Ben and I never got to work with your father,
but we heard great things.
Isn't that right, partner?
Indeed.
Yeah. My pop would have been real pleased
that so many guys from the precinct showed up today.
Yeah, you know, Denise was just telling me
how her dad won big in Atlantic City,
took an early retirement.
It was funny how news like that
didn't make its way back to the station, though?
Well, not really,
considering he hadn't worked there in years.
Pop wasn't one to brag.
And, besides, he was real busy the last few weeks
trying to sell the house.
Excuse me.
Come on. You tell me that doesn't sound suspicious,
like he's trying to get out of town in a hurry.
We're at the man's wake.
Exactly.
And there may be people in this room
who have answers that I need.
That may be true, but if you keep pursuing this,
I'm putting in for a new partner.
Conrad Grayson then imprisons you
in the basement of a silo for 10 years,
cut off from the world.
What was it like in there?
Filthy, oppressive.
It was inhuman, is what it was.
I drank water from the same place that I bathed.
I slept on a small cot,
that is, when I could sleep.
I spent over 4,000 days of my life down there,
yet time, it seemed to stand still.
I needed it to so that I could maintain hope.
But it wasn't living.
It was survival.
The question on all of our minds is,
how did you not give up?
Well, there were times when I thought about ending it all.
But then, the people who wronged me would have won,
and I never would have had the chance
to see the people that I loved,
one of whom is here today.
Nolan, come join me.
David's exhausted.
This is too much for him. We need to end this.
This is exactly what
the audience wants to hear, Victoria.
I know I do.
All right, well, it's public knowledge
that Mr. Clarke and entrepreneur Nolan Ross
were business associates years ago.
Mr. Ross, welcome.
Nolan was like the son I never had.
And I knew his first company would be a success,
and it was.
Well, because you had the courage to invest in me.
An investment that paid off.
I figured the profits would provide
a nice nest egg for my daughter, Amanda.
She never got the money, did she, Nolan?
Of course she did. Of course she did.
You lied to her, and you lied to me.
And you stole her inheritance.
I gave her all the money that she was owed.
What-what she chose to do with it, I-I,
I obtained her financial records.
When she turned 18,
she was to receive hundreds of millions of dollars,
but instead, she only got $100,000.
That's quite a discrepancy, don't you think?
David, please. This is not the place.
I trusted you.
I left the responsibility
of my daughter's future in your hands.
But while you were out buying custom cars
and your own private island, she was scraping by.
She worked as a stripper, for god's sakes.
She died without knowing that you'd betrayed her,
that you'd betrayed me.
And for that, I will never forgive you.
Mr. Ross, can you address these allegations?
Not at this time.
Margaux Lemarchal.
Margaux, hi. Louise here.
I just wanted to call and tell you
how great the David Clarke piece was.
I mean, really riveting stuff.
Oh, thank you. Very kind of you to call.
It was--
How did Victoria feel about it?
Victoria Grayson?
I suppose she thought it went well.
Well, we can talk more about it tomorrow.
That is, if you're still up for a rematch.
Yes.
By the way, how did you know
I would be at the office so late?
Oh, I just took a shot.
You seem like one of those workaholic types.
Anyway, see you tomorrow.
Okay, bye.
Your message sounded urgent.
Is something wrong?
I just wanted to say goodbye.
I don't understand.
Where are you going?
I'm taking control of my own life.
I'm checking myself into rehab.
Oh, Charlotte!
Oh, that's wonderful!
I know some excellent facilities.
Where do you think you'll be going?
I'd rather not say,
since a large part of me doing this
has to do with me getting away from you and your lies.
David deserves to know the truth about Emily.
But don't worry. I'm not gonna say anything.
It's your lie.
I'm just not gonna stick around to watch you tell it.
I'm doing what's best for David.
Would you stop?
You're doing this to hurt Emily.
Charlotte, you know me.
I thought I did.
And then I found out you killed Aiden.
And I know why you killed him --
Because you blamed Emily for Pascal's death.
But he died because she was seeking the truth
about what you did to David.
I'm sick of being caught
between you and Emily and your cycle of hate.
I want out!
What I did to David all those years ago...
All the things I have done...
I have acted out of love,
to keep our family together, Charlotte.
Family?
Look around you, mother.
This family you've been working so hard to keep together --
you've done nothing but tear us apart.
I love you, baby.
She died never knowing that you'd betrayed her,
that you'd betrayed me.
For that, I will never forgive you.
Mr. Ross, can you address these allegations?
Not at this time.
Yeah, you really need to start calling first.
As far as I'm concerned, my money bought this house.
You're just the coward who lives in it.
How could you believe I would do something like that...
To you, to Amanda?
You know me, David.
I thought I did.
The man I know wouldn't have stolen money from my daughter.
I didn't keep that money.
Oh, yeah? Who'd you give it to?
I-I -- I g-- I gave it to Amanda!
But -- - But what?
Oh, she burned through $500 million
without leaving a paper trail?
I want the truth, Nolan.
Yeah, so do I!
You said that you wanted me by your side,
that you believed in me!
All an elaborate trap that you knew I would fall for
because I trust you like a father.
If I was your father, I would have done that a long time ago.
Then you're more like him than I ever realized.
God.
Are you okay? What happened?
Your lies... finally caught up to me.
Looking for something?
You scared the hell out of me.
I thought you'd left.
And I figured you hadn't.
Now you're breaking into Mostrowski's garage?
Jack, look, if you had any idea
how many of these things didn't add up here...
You really think that Mostrowski had something to do with it?
I studied that case file.
When Mo was a suspect,
they pulled his credit card and his phone records.
The guy hadn't left a five-mile radius in two years.
He never told people that he won in Atlantic city
because he didn't win.
That was just some story he told to his daughter
to explain a sudden windfall and early retirement.
Yeah, Mo was cleared of the murder,
but that doesn't mean that he didn't provide
an assist for someone who paid him off.
So what are you doing out here?
Denise told me her dad lived alone.
But I spoke with some of the neighbors,
and they told me that they saw someone
coming and going from this garage
over the last several months.
So I'm not leaving until I search this place.
You know what? You make a strong case.
But like I said, we're partners, so...
if you're not gonna give this up,
I guess I'm just gonna have to join you.
I'm really proud of you, Char.
What finally pushed you to make a change?
Our mother.
Or, at least, the thought of me turning into our mother.
Trust me. I get it.
Every time I look in the mirror,
I'm terrified I'll see dad staring back.
But you're better than both of them. You know that, right?
You are, too.
I don't know where I'd be without you, Daniel.
Probably still listening to Hilary Duff
and surfing Myspace.
Ouch. The truth hurts.
Seriously, though,
that's what big brothers are for, right?
Hey, you know...
you never shied away from telling me the truth,
even when everyone else was lying to me.
I love you for that.
That's true,
and I'd hate to leave on a lie.
There's something else I need to tell you.
It's about Emily.
I just wanted to make sure that you were okay
after all that transpired.
Come, sit.
I'm sorry that I was distant this morning.
It was intentional.
I just couldn't risk involving you in my plan for Nolan,
should he... decide to retaliate.
I see.
Went over to see him this evening.
Things got out of hand.
You were reacting on behalf of your child.
I know the feeling well.
No. It's more than that.
Amanda's gone.
Nolan was one of the few people from my old life...
before it got ripped away.
Now you're the only person left that connects me to my past.
I'll always be here for you, David.
Always.
I hope you know that.
Stay with me here tonight.
And every night.
I want nothing more.
I can't believe he did this to you.
He didn't.
You did because you're still keeping him in the dark.
Wake up and smell the subtext, Emily.
He thinks I stole money from Amanda, ergo you,
because he's still protecting the memory of you
because he loves you.
It's time to tell him.
