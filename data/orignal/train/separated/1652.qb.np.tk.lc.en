take him down ! he &apos;s got you , sheldon .
look at this move ! he &apos;s completely schooling you .
hey , guys. guys .
some of the other waitresses wanted me to ask you something .
it &apos;s called tresling . it combines the physical strength of arm wrestling
with the mental agility of tetris into the ultimate spots .
yeah , that &apos;s terrific .
but they wanted me to ask you to cut it the hell out .
great . come here , guys . come on .
happy birthday to you .
we might as well stop . it &apos;s a stalemate . you &apos;re beating me in tetris ,
but you &apos;ve got the upper body strength of a keebler elf .
keebler elf ? i &apos;ve got your keebler elf right here .
okay , it &apos;s a stalemate .
so , leonard , will we be seeing you
on saturday for your free birthday cheesecake ?
he can &apos;t eat cheesecake .
he &apos;s lactose intolerant .
okay , he can have carrot cake .
what about the cream cheese frosting ?
he can scrape it off .
forget about the cake .
how do you know that my birthday &apos;s saturday ?
i did your horoscope , remember ?
i was going to do everybody &apos;s ,
until sheldon went on one of his typical psychotic rants .
for the record ,
&quot; that psychotic rant &quot; was a concise summation
of the research of bertram forer , who in 1948,
proved conclusively through meticulously designed
experiments that astrology is nothing
but pseudo @-@ scientific hokum .
blah , blah , blah. typical taurus .
so , seriously. are we going to see you saturday ?
uh , i don &apos;t inink so. why not ?
i don &apos;t celebrate my birthday .
shut up. yeah , you do .
it &apos;s no big deal ; it &apos;s just the way i was raised .
my parents focused on celebrating achievements ,
and being expelled from a birth canal
was not considered one of them .
that &apos;s so silly .
it &apos;s actually based on very sound theories .
his mother published a paper on it .
well , what was it called ?
&quot; i hate my son and that &apos;s why he can &apos;t have cake &quot; ?
it was obviously effective .
leonard grew up to be an experimental physicist .
perhaps if she &apos;d also denied him christmas ,
he &apos;d be a little better at it .
thank you .
well , i love birthdays .
waking up to mom &apos;s special french toast breakfast ,
wearing the birthday king crown ,
playing laser tag with all my friends ...
yeah , see ?
that &apos;s what kids should have .
actually , that was last year .
so you really never had a birthday party ?
no , but it was okay .
i mean , when i was little ,
i &apos;d think maybe my parents would change
their mind and surprise me with a party .
like this one birthday i came home from my cello
lesson and i saw a lot of strange cars parked out front .
when i got to the door ,
i could hear people whispering
and i could smell german chocolate cake ,
which is my favorite .
and ?
it turns out my grandfather had died .
oh , my god. that &apos;s terrible .
well , it was kind of like a birthday party .
i got to see all my cousins , and there was cake , so ...
that &apos;s the saddest thing i &apos;ve ever heard .
you think ?
go ahead , tell her about your senior prom .
the big bang theory s01e16
make sure they remember-- no peanuts .
howard , every thai restaurant in town
knows you can &apos;t eat peanuts .
when they see me coming , they go , &quot; ah , no @-@ peanut boy ! &quot;
hello , penny .
leonard just left .
i know . i want to talk to you .
what would we talk about ?
we have no overlapping areas of interest i &apos;m aware of .
as you know , i don &apos;t care for chitchat .
can you just let me in ?
well , all right , but i don &apos;t see this as a promising endeavor .
okay , here &apos;s the deal .
we are going to throw leonard a kick @-@ ass
surprise party for his birthday on saturday .
i hardly think so .
leonard made it very clear he doesn &apos;t want a party .
did someone say ... &quot; party &quot; ?
he just doesn &apos;t know he wants one &apos; cause he &apos;s never had one .
i suppose that &apos;s possible , but for the record ,
i &apos;ve never had a threesome and yet i still know i want one .
howard ,
here &apos;s the difference-- the possibility exists that
leonard could have a birthday party before hell freezes over .
fine. if i do have a threesome , you can &apos;t be part of it .
i &apos;m just kidding. yes , you can .
can you bring a friend .
i think a birthday party &apos;s a terrible idea .
i envy leonard for growing up without that anguish .
anguish ? !
year after year ,
i had to endure wearing comical hats while being
forced into the crowded , sweaty hell of bouncy castles .
not to mention being blindfolded and being spun toward a
grotesque illess donkey as the other children mocked my disorientation .
okay , sweetie ,
i understand u have scars that no nonprofeioional can heal , but ,
nevertheless , we &apos;re going to throw leonard a birthday party .
have i pointed out that i &apos;m extremely uncomforblble with dancing ,
loud music and most other forms of alcohol @-@ induced frivolity ?
nevertheless , we &apos;re ...
in addition , i really don &apos;t think that leonard wtsts ...
you either you help me throw leonard a birtayay party or , so help me god ,
i will go into your bedroom and unbag all of your most valuable ,
mint @-@ condition comic books .
and on one of them-- you won &apos;t know which--
i &apos;ll draw a tiny happy face in ink. you can &apos;t do that .
if you make a mark in a mint comic book , it &apos;s no longer mint .
sheldon , do you understand the concept of blackmail ?
well , of course , i ... oh .
yeah , i have an idea .
let &apos;s throw leonard a kick @-@ ass birthday party .
that &apos;s not the secret knock .
this is the secret knock .
what difference does it make ?
the whole point of a secret knock is to establish a
non @-@ verbal signal to verify the identity of one &apos;s co @-@ conspirators .
is that raj and howard ?
possibly , but unverified .
will you just let us in .
luckily for you , this is not a nuclear reactor .
so what &apos;d you get the birthday boy ?
well , raj got him an awesome ,
limited edition dark knight sculpture
based on alex ross &apos;s definitive batman .
and i got him this amazing autographed copy
of the feynman lectures on physics .
nice .
i got him a sweater .
okay , well , he might like that .
i &apos;ve seen him get chilly .
sheldon , i didn &apos;t see your present .
that &apos;s because i didn &apos;t bring one .
why not ? don &apos;t ask .
the entire institution of gift @-@ giving makes no sense .
too late. let &apos;s say i go out and i spend $ 50 on you .
it &apos;s a laborious activity because i have to imagine what you need ,
whereas you know what you need .
now , i could simplify things-- just give you the $ 50 directly ,
and then you could give me $ 50 on my birthday , and so on ,
until one of us dies , leaving the other one old and $ 50 richer .
and i ask you , is it worth it ?
told you not to ask .
well , sheldon , you &apos;re his friend .
friends give each other presents .
i accept your premise ; i reject your conclusion .
try telling him it &apos;s a non @-@ optional social convention .
what ?
just do it .
it &apos;s a non @-@ optional ...
social convention .
oh. fair enough .
he came with a manual .
question-- how am i going to get leonard
a present before the party ?
i don &apos;t drive and the only things available within
walking distance are a thai restaurant and a gas station .
i suppose i could wrap up an order of
mee krob and a couple of lottery scratchers .
okay let &apos;s do this-- i will drive sheldon to get a present .
and howard , you need to get rid of leonard for about two hours .
no problem .
and then , raj , you bring the stuff
across the hall and start setting up .
what if guests show up ?
entertain them .
what if they &apos;re women ?
stare at them and make them feel uncomfortable .
how &apos;s it goin &apos; ?
fine .
so listen , the nuart is showing the revised ,
definitive cut of blade runner .
seen it .
no , you &apos;ve seen the 25th anniversary final cut .
this one has eight seconds of previously unseen footage .
they say it completely changes the tone of the film .
uh ... pass .
come on .
afterwards , there &apos;s a q &amp; a with harrison ford &apos;s body double .
look , i &apos;m in the halo battle of my life here .
there &apos;s this kid in copenhagen-- he has no immune system ,
so all he does is sit in his bubble and play halo 24 @-@ seven .
can &apos;t you play him some other time ?
not if you believe his doctors .
oh , my god , do you smell gas ?
no .
yeah , no .
you know , they have dvds over there .
yes , but they have dvd burners over here .
leonard needs a dvd burner .
sheldon , a gift shouldn &apos;t be something someone needs ,
it should be something fun .
you know , something they wouldn &apos;t buy for themself .
you mean like a sweater ?
it &apos;s a fun sweater .
it &apos;s got a bold geometric print .
is it the geometry that makes it fun ? okay ...
the point is one of the ways we show we care about people is
by putting thought and imagination into the gifts we give them .
okay , i see .
so , not a dvd burner exactly .
something he wouldn &apos;t buy for himself .
something fun. something like ...
an 802 @-@ 11n wireless router !
here you go , copenhagen boy .
how about a taste of hans christian hand grenade ?
oh , that could not feel good .
come on , come ...
oh , you clever ...
come on. come on .
take that !
what &apos;s the matter ?
this granola bar , it has peanuts in it !
oh , my god. why did you eat it ?
i don &apos;t know . it was just there .
if i had a gun there , would you have shot yourself ?
don &apos;t yell at me !
i &apos;ve got to go to the emergency room !
now ? ! no , after my tongue has swollen to the size of a brisket !
all right , uh , just let me get my keys .
oh , god , oh , god , oh , god !
the laundry is out of the hamper .
okay , sheldon , what was it supposed to be ?
fine. it &apos;s out of the washer !
i &apos;ll call you when it &apos;s in the dryer .
all right , let &apos;s go .
what do you think ?
um , that one .
because of the two additional ethernet ports ?
sure.he doesn &apos;t need them .
he &apos;s already got a six @-@ port ethernet switch .
oh , okay , then this one .
why ? i don &apos;t know .
the man on the box looks so happy .
penny , if i &apos;m going to buy leonard a gift ,
i &apos;m going to do it right .
i refuse to let him experience the same childhood trauma i did .
i know i &apos;m gonna regret this , but what trauma ?
on my 12th birthday ,
i really wanted a titanium centrifuge
so , you know , i could separate radioactive isotopes .
of course .
instead of a titanium centrifuge , my parents bought me ...
wow , this is hard .
they got me a motorized dirt bike .
no !
what 12 @-@ year @-@ old boy wants a motorized dirt bike ?
all of them ?
really ?
yeah. huh .
okay , so we &apos;re getting this one ?
yeah , i suppose .
all right , let &apos;s go .
excuse me .
do you know anything about this stuff ?
i know everything about this stuff .
okay ,
i have my own whwholesale flower business
and i want to hook up my computer in the front entrance
with the one in my refrigerated warehouse .
here , buy this one . look , it &apos;s the one we &apos;re getting .
see ? happy guy .
no , no , no , she doesn &apos;t want that .
she needs a point @-@ to @-@ point peer network with a range extender .
thank you .
which hard drive do i want-- firewire or usb ?
it depends on what bus you have available .
i drive a chevy cavalier .
oh , dear lord .
sheldon , we have to go. not now , penny .
this poor man needs me .
you , hold on . i &apos;ll be right with you .
what computer do you have ?
and please don &apos;t say &quot; a white one . &quot;
excuse me .
fill this out. have a seat .
no , listen .
we &apos;re throwing my friend a surprise party and i &apos;m
supposed to keep him out of his apartment for two hours .
uh @-@ huh. fill this out and have a seat .
no , see ,
the only way i could get him to leave was to tell
him i ate a peanut because i &apos;m allergic to peanuts .
oh. well , in that case , fill this out and have a seat .
look ,
all i need from you is to take me in the back , give me a band @-@ aid and
so i can pretend i had a shot of epinephrine
and then you tell my friend you need to keep me
under observation for about an hour , hour and a half .
is that all you need ?
yes. get out of my er .
no , you don &apos;t understand .
oh , i understand , but unfortunately ,
this hospalal is not equipped to treat stupid .
okay , i get it .
i know how the world works .
how about if i were to introduce to you to the man who freed your people ?
unless my people were freed by benjamin franklin
and his five twin brothers , you are wasting your time .
hey , sorry , i couldn &apos;t find a parking spot .
how are you doing ?
bad , very bad .
really ? you don &apos;t look like you &apos;re swelling up at all .
maybe we should just pick up some benadryl at the drugstore and go home .
we can &apos;t go home. why not ?
becaus .... because ...
brisket ! brisket !
water ! need water ! i &apos;ll be right back .
penny , listen , i &apos;ve got a problem .
yeah , well , so do i .
look , you gotta stall leonard a little longer .
i don &apos;t think i can .
you have to. we all have to be there at the same time to yell surprise .
okay , you have to understand something .
we &apos;re in a hospital right now .
why ? is leonard okay ?
leonard &apos;s fine . i &apos;m fine .
thanks for asking , by the way .
okay , i don &apos;t need your attitude .
listen , just hold him there a little longer .
look , i &apos;ve done my best ,
but he wants to go home and i don &apos;t know how to stop him .
ok , , how about this ?
you keep him there a little longer , and when you get to the party ,
i &apos;ll point out which of my friends are easy ?
don &apos;t toy with me , woman .
i got a hot former fat girl with no self @-@ esteem ,
i got a girl who punishes her father by sleeping around and
alcoholi who &apos;s two tequila shots
away from letting you wear her like a hat .
thy will be done .
i &apos;m doing this for you , little buddy .
okay , we don &apos;t have that in stock ...
but i can special @-@ order it for you .
him .
excuse me , sir. you don &apos;t work here .
yes , well , apparently , neither does anyone else .
sheldon , we have to go why ?
well , for one thing , we &apos;re late for leonard &apos;s birthday party ,
and for another , i told him to call security .
good luck .
by the way , a six @-@ year @-@ old could hack your cocomputer system .
keep walking .
&quot; 1234 &quot; is not a secure password .
excusee @-@ e-- my friend is having an allergic reaction to peanuts .
no , he &apos;s not .
yes , he is .
look , sir , we are very busy here , and i ...
holy crap !
please help me !
cocode four ! i need a gurney !
right away ! right away !
thank you .
say what you will about the healthcare system in this country ,
but when they &apos;re afraid of lawsuits , they sure test everything .
i really don &apos;t think the colonoopopy was necessary .
you know , before you got all swollen up ,
i actually thought you were trying to keep me out of
the apartment so you could throw me a surprise party .
oh , right , it &apos;s your birthday .
i had no idea it was your birthday .
i completely forgot .
wow , what a lousy way to spend a birthday .
well , it &apos;s all over now .
there is a party , isn &apos;t there ?
maybe .
howard ?
are you mad ?
how could i be mad ? ?
you actually risked your life because you care about me .
yeah , that &apos;s why i did it all right .
here we go .
my first birthday party .
dude , everybody left an hour ago .
surprise !
okay , leonard , here i am on your birthday party .
i don &apos;t know where you are , dude , but it &apos;s really kick @-@ ass !
everyone is very , very drunk and ...
oh , and look , there &apos;s a girl taking her shirt off !
that &apos;s my friend carol .
remind me-- i gotta introduce her to howard .
oh , sweet krishna , shake that rupee maker !
i &apos;m so sorry you didn &apos;t get your party .
oh , it &apos;s okay .
well , happy birthday , anyways .
