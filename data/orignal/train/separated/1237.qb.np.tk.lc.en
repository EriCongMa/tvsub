they can &apos;t punish us .
it &apos;s not a punishment .
really ?
being disinvited to your own prom ?
you can still celebrate that night in a quiet ,
more intimate way .
veronica &apos;s offered to host a small gathering in the backyard barn .
alison went to prom .
she &apos;s hoping to meet charles .
sara ? i can &apos;t believe you &apos;d leave your prom ..
this is where i felt i should be . with you .
our recipients are ultimately chosen by my employer .
would that be mr. carissimi ?
that guy was definitely hiding something .
yeah , you think ?
okay , you couldn &apos;t pick that even if you tried .
emily , this is ali &apos;s phone .
give her a little kiss .
&apos;is that you , charles ? &apos;
i know who a is .
his name is charles dilaurentis and he &apos;s my brother .
charles ..
oh , my god .
please don &apos;t do this !
we may have a visual of the suspect on the roof .
i &apos;ll do whatever it takes to help you .
look , just because we know who you are
it doesn &apos;t mean the game is over .
hold your fire .
we have civvies up there !
i said stand down !
don &apos;t do this to your sister .
you spent your whole life trying to get back to your family .
it &apos;s not too late .
you &apos;ve been such a bitch to us , but we heard your story .
we understand .
no !
no answer .
okay . try again .
come on !
open the door !
you &apos;ve reached the dilaurent ..
nobody &apos;s home .
ali could be on the roof . did anybody check the roof ?
guys , we promised toby that we would stay here
until he escorted us out , remember ?
the guys are talking to clark and tanner .
she &apos;s got a lot of questions , for all of us .
okay , well , how long do we have to stay here ?
we could be out there looking for her .
em , look , we have to believe that charles isn &apos;t gonna hurt alison .
she &apos;s his sister .
charles drove his car through my house , aria , okay ?
i believe he &apos;ll hurt anybody who gets in his way .
guys ..
we &apos;re not alone in here .
are you sure that you saw somebody ?
yeah , i &apos;m sure .
hey , aria , there &apos;s no way out of here .
god , mona , you scared the crap out of us .
i &apos;ve been following alison since yesterday morning .
i lost her when you guys jumped the cop .
you knew that clark was a cop ?
aria , maybe you thought he was always happy to see you ,
but i could never get past the bulge in his pants .
what is that ?
i started snarfing alison ever since she came back to town .
yesterday , she started getting texts . from charles .
i couldn &apos;t get a lock on where he was
so i coded a program to decrypt the signal source and ..
what is it ?
mona .
i @-@ it took a while , but ..
okay , mona , just finish the sentence ! please .
what is it ?
charles has his own cellular network
and the servers are located at ..
the carissimi group .
i knew it . rhys is charles .
em , where are you going ?
i &apos;m going to get ali .
i &apos;m calling tanner .
fine , but i &apos;m not waiting around to answer a million questions .
let &apos;s go .
oh , my god ! dad ?
no !
oh , my god . dad .
why are the cops here ?
wait , you don &apos;t think that &apos;s ali &apos;s chopped @-@ up body
in those bags , is it ?
hanna .
what ?
isn &apos;t that what we &apos;re all thinking ?
no .
no .
what is in those bags ?
and why are they moving them in the middle of the night ?
here comes the cavalry .
let &apos;s go .
try his birthday .
do you seriously think we can outsmart a ?
uh , try mrs. d. &apos; s , 12 @-@ 18 .
wait , you know mrs. d. &apos; s birthday ?
i &apos;m a self @-@ taught eidetiker .
that &apos;s not a learned skill . it &apos;s a phenomenon .
yeah , what is it ?
five days after he took me to the bunker
charles gave me a red , white and blue cupcake .
but it wasn &apos;t fourth of july .
i kept track of every day i was there .
and every year , he gave me a cupcake on september 7th .
已解锁
see ? we are smarter than charles .
it &apos;s just a stupid room .
yeah , but a &apos;s not stupid .
did we just walk inside a &apos;s brain ?
yeah , hanna . i think we did .
i think he knows we &apos;re here .
sara ? you okay ?
i &apos;m gonna wait out here .
it &apos;s a little tight in there .
sara !
what is that ?
this is a live feed .
it &apos;s alison .
where is she ?
why would you kill them ?
oh , my god .
oh , my god . it &apos;s jason and mr. d.
we &apos;re family .
who is she talking to ?
oh , my god . ali &apos;s with charles .
don &apos;t be so dramatic , ali .
cece ?
they &apos;re not dead ... yet .
how could you do this to me ?
i risked everything to help you .
you gave me a passport and a plane ticket .
i &apos;d hardly call that everything .
it was all that i had .
if you keep making this about you , ali
it &apos;s gonna be a long night and we don &apos;t have much time .
what is she planning ?
* lord help the mister *
* who comes between me and my sister *
does she think we came between her and ali ?
is that what this has all been about ?
wait , so cece is charles ?
sh @-@ she is a she , right ?
wait , shouldn &apos;t the cops be here by now ?
they &apos;re not coming .
how do you think cece escaped police custody ?
sara called tanner directly , right ?
what , wait , you think tanner is working for cece ?
yeah , and i bet she told sara that we &apos;re all just fine .
tanner does wear nice shoes .
guys , quiet .
they never understood how much i loved you .
from the moment mom brought you home ..
i never left your side .
you were like my very own living doll .
and when my dolly was sad ..
it made me sad too .
it &apos;s okay , ali .
i &apos;ll go get mommy . shh . shh .
mommy . mommy .
do you know what makes me feel better ?
come on , baby . i will help you .
shh , ali , it &apos;s okay .
what &apos;s wrong with you ?
i love you , charlie .
and i always will .
i love you more , mommy .
this wasn &apos;t the first time , jess .
we &apos;re doing the right thing .
we can &apos;t risk him harming jason or the baby .
i never meant to hurt you .
but that &apos;s all dad needed to get rid of me .
but it was an accident .
he had to have known that .
oh , i &apos;m sure he did .
i don &apos;t understand .
for as long as i can remember ..
i asked mom to buy me dresses .
but he wouldn &apos;t let her
so i &apos;d just play dress up in her closet .
she thought it was cute .
but dad found out ... and ..
they can hear us . they just can &apos;t move .
you never visited me .
not even once .
thank god neither of us inherited the bastard &apos;s beady eyes .
that &apos;s what cece did to me .
my brain kept telling me to scream
but my @-@ my body couldn &apos;t move .
jason and mr. d.
are living a nightmare they can &apos;t wake up from .
oh , my god , jason .
i feel sorry for jason ,
but i don &apos;t think i could ever feel bad for mr. d.
same .
same .
mom came to visit me as often as she could .
aunt carol came a couple of times .
but ... for the next seven years at radley ..
i was almost completely alone .
that must have been awful .
you think ?
when i turned twelve ..
mom bought me this beautiful yellow dress for christmas .
and after that , every time she would buy you clothes ..
she would buy me the same outfit .
almost like we were twins .
you &apos;re beautiful .
absolutely stunning .
thanks , bethany .
wish we could find a way out of here .
leaving &apos;s easy , charles .
it &apos;s staying gone that would be tough .
my mom always says that nothing &apos;s more believable
than a really good lie .
we just need to come up with a great story .
something fabulous
and devastating at the same time .
like ..
we got lost in the woods
and we were raised by a pack of wolves .
amateur .
does it look like i could survive in the woods ?
you &apos;re too pretty for that .
our parents were crackheads .
they sold us for a fix .
please don &apos;t make me talk about it anymore .
it &apos;s too painful .
wow . you &apos;re good .
oh , it &apos;s that goody two @-@ shoes , mrs. cavanaugh .
she can &apos;t see me like this . you have to help me .
of course .
oh , my god !
bethany , what did you do ?
what did i do ?
you pushed her ... freak .
so , bethany blamed you for mrs. cavanaugh &apos;s death ?
no one believed the boy wearing the dress .
i had the most to lose ,
so they thought i pushed her .
even mom ?
she paid off wilden
to make sure marion &apos;s death
was ruled a suicide .
oh , my god .
he let toby think his mother killed herself .
all this time , he thought she chose to leave him .
that changed him .
mrs. d. sacrificed toby for charles .
now we know who taught a how to treat people like dolls .
mr. d. abandoned him
but mrs. d. taught charles how to be a.
after that ..
the doctors gave me a new diagnosis .
intermittent explosive disorder .
why is that funny ?
&apos;cause it was an accurate diagnosis ...
for that crazy bitch , bethany .
the next couple of years , they doped me up on tranqs
till i almost drowned in my own drool .
literally .
i &apos;m so sorry .
wait . now ali &apos;s apologizing ?
i mean , is she forgetting the hell that a put us through ?
all of us , including her ?
i think the quacks felt bad for almost killing me
so they let me out for a funeral .
who died ?
charles .
we buried him at aunt carol &apos;s .
and then mom finally accepted me as her daughter ...
and i thought i was gonna get to go home ...
but she took me back to radley ... as charlotte .
wait , so charles is cece
but cece is charlotte ?
&apos;what is that ? &apos;
it &apos;s a motion sensor .
what is it ?
it &apos;s radley .
the rear west wing . it &apos;s on the second floor .
there &apos;s another one ?
i thought ali and cece were the only two red coats .
so who &apos;s that ?
what is she doing with those trash cans ?
that &apos;s not trash .
oh , my god .
that &apos;s why she &apos;s telling us her story
that &apos;s how she &apos;s gonna end it .
cece &apos;s gonna blow up radley .
i couldn &apos;t trust anyone after bethany .
so i found a way to escape radley ... without ever leaving .
mom .
oh , i have some fantastic news .
they &apos;re letting me out ?
well , sort of .
either i &apos;m locked in here , or i &apos;m not .
there &apos;s no sort of being a patient at radley .
the board has granted you permission to attend classes at upenn .
how did you do that ? how ..
you did it , charlotte
by showing them how smart you are .
now , now , don &apos;t cry .
i &apos;m very proud of you .
i thought going to school would be fun
but i already knew most of what they were teaching .
one day , classes were cancelled ...
okay , i called in a bomb threat .
i knew it was a risk ...
but i needed to see my family .
would it kill you to smile ?
what &apos;s it to you ?
rude much ?
sorry , i ..
what ?
can we start again ?
i &apos;m jason . jason dilaurentis .
next , please .
do you even go to school here ?
no .
but i bet i &apos;ll be the prettiest girl in the yearbook .
you didn &apos;t tell me your name .
you &apos;re right . i didn &apos;t .
i &apos;m cece .
cece drake .
i know what you &apos;re gonna say .
it &apos;s screwed up that i dated my brother .
did you guys ...
okay , that &apos;s just sick , ali .
like i said , it &apos;s my brother .
why do you think he was so mad all the time ?
he was so frustrated .
and who could blame him ?
i mean , look at me .
&apos;i can &apos;t believe mom was okay with this.&apos;
mom didn &apos;t know cece was charlotte
until the day we left for cape may .
how could you risk everything you &apos;ve worked so hard for ?
mom , could you please ? jason and ali are inside .
if they find out , he &apos;ll kill me .
so all this time , you &apos;ve been
pretending to go to school
while you &apos;re running around rosewood
with my children ?
i &apos;m your child too .
i just wanted to be with my family .
jason asked your father if he could bring his girlfriend ..
to the cape , he &apos;s on his way home now to meet you .
what would happen if he found out about me ?
mom , what would happen if he found out about me ?
he thinks you &apos;re dead .
you told him that grave was real ?
all this time ..
i thought you did that for me
but you did that for you .
you did that to protect you .
what ?
you didn &apos;t just bury charles
you buried your dirty secret .
i lied to him so that you could finally be you .
he never would have allowed it .
okay , i know i &apos;m bringing a lot ...
not now , ali .
mom ! i didn &apos;t know you were home .
this is cece .
she was on the porch when i pulled up .
she &apos;s lovely , jason .
you must be cece .
i &apos;m mr. dilaurentis .
so nice to meet you .
but i can see you all are getting ready to leave so ..
i &apos;m gonna get out of your hair .
but i thought you were coming with us .
really ? oh , my god .
this is gonna be the best summer ever .
i know you went through a lot that summer .
but we had a hell of a lot of fun too .
ali ..
every time i remember something ..
i have to look at it differently now .
we were so close .
why didn &apos;t you just tell me the truth ?
i was going to .
i swear .
but that bitch , bethany , she ruined everything .
she found out mom was having an affair with her dad
and she lost it .
she stole my clothes , she knew i had out privileges
and she snuck out of radley .
she was gonna hurt mom .
no !
what have you done ? what have you done ?
i swear , i thought it was bethany .
i swear , i didn &apos;t know it was ali , mom .
oh , god .
you have to forgive me , mom .
please , you gotta forgive me , mom .
she wouldn &apos;t look at me .
she wouldn &apos;t even look at me .
mona , are you okay ?
i killed bethany .
i &apos;d been sending ali threats .
i didn &apos;t wanna hurt her . i just wanted to scare her .
but that night , so many people were mad at alison .
she was all alone in her yard , and the shovel was right there .
it all happened so fast .
you hated ali that much ?
enough to kill her ?
when i hit her , all i could hear was ali berating me .
every awful thing she &apos;d ever said to me all at once .
but if cece hit ali ..
bethany had blond hair , and she was dressed just like alison .
i killed an innocent person .
bethany wasn &apos;t innocent .
jason told emily that he saw you that night
wearing my yellow top .
maybe he saw ... bethany
or he @-@ he saw you .
he didn &apos;t see me .
you found her on the highway , outside of radley .
that &apos;s all anybody needs to know .
i was never in rosewood tonight , ma &apos;am .
and neither was your daughter .
they &apos;re never gonna let me out again .
maybe that &apos;s for the best .
maybe dad was right about me .
i &apos;ll understand if you ...
never wanna see me again .
let &apos;s just give it some time .
i thought it would take a long time ..
for mom to forgive me .
it never occurred to me
that she never totally would .
hey , you &apos;re supposed to be getting us out of here .
i am .
ah ! cece &apos;s the real wolf of wall street .
she &apos;s never made a bad investment .
oh , my god . he &apos;s legit .
cece hired rhys as a decoy .
he didn &apos;t even know that he was a stooge .
no one found out i was in rosewood that night .
but the doctors at radley knew i flew the coop
so ... they took away my out privileges
and i was alone again .
and then the craziest girl showed up .
she was awesome .
i &apos;d sneak into her room every night for story time .
she was so ..
drugged up that in the beginning
she thought i was you .
i did everything you asked me to .
i &apos;m proud of you .
you are ?
you &apos;re getting better .
just keep taking your meds .
i will , ali .
i promise .
tell me more about the girls .
i need to know everything .
i was so bummed when they started
weaning mona off her meds .
hearing about what she did to those bitches
was , like , the only thing i looked forward to .
so mona did know it was you ?
i stopped visiting her before
she snapped out of her drug daze .
i could never trust mona .
she was hanna &apos;s legit friend
and she ran her over with a car .
where &apos;s the loyalty in that ?
i really am sorry .
i know .
mona wasn &apos;t ready to end the game .
and she was like houdini getting in and out of places .
so i made a deal with her .
if she helped me get out of radley
i &apos;d play the game with her .
it was like bethany said , leaving wasn &apos;t hard .
but i needed mona &apos;s help to stay gone .
and my first assignment
was making friends in rosewood .
take it from me ,
you &apos;re always better off with a really good lie .
is it just me or did that sound a lot like ..
alison .
something wrong ?
oh . no . sorry .
wow . you just sound a lot like one of our friends .
i hope she &apos;s brilliant . what &apos;s her name ?
alison dilaurentis .
you were friends of ali &apos;s ?
me too . i &apos;m cece .
i was doing my best ali imitation ever .
you should have seen the look on those girls &apos; faces .
oh , it was worth a million bucks .
so why did you move back to rosewood ?
listen , i hate to make tracks , but i &apos;m already late
and my boss is high @-@ strung and aggressively sober .
come visit me at the new boutique across the street .
oh , and if you ever feel like doing a little free shopping ,
i &apos;d be happy to turn the other away .
i @-@ i think you &apos;re thinking of hanna .
she &apos;s not here .
okay , that &apos;s not just me , right ?
that chick is freakishly like ali .
mona told me those bitches were happy
that you were gone .
and that , oh ...
that really , really pissed me off .
i mean ,
those girls were supposed to be your friends .
they got what they deserved .
i don &apos;t remember telling cece about you .
but somebody at radley did start sending me
riddles and twisted rhymes .
and it got me really excited about playing the game again .
i kept seeing this blond in a red coat
uh , w @-@ watching the girls and i ...
first i thought i &apos;d lost it .
i mean , i @-@ i @-@ i watched mom bury you .
i knew if you were alive ...
you &apos;d show up if the girls were in trouble .
they all thought you were flying the plane that night .
but i sent a decoy to distract them .
ali ?
mona thinks she &apos;s about to see you .
she doesn &apos;t have a clue .
sara harvey was the other red coat ?
when i needed her to be .
what ?
no way . she &apos;s lying .
and that night , she was supposed to keep mona busy ...
while i trapped the girls .
oh , it was the perfect plan .
then shana showed up
and all hell broke loose .
did anyone see her ?
see who ?
alison .
she pulled me out of there .
she pulled us all out .
no , you &apos;re hallucinating .
she was here . i swear it .
ali &apos;s dead .
i saw her too .
so did i.
i knew i wasn &apos;t crazy .
you really were alive .
if you really cared about me ...
why did you keep playing the game ?
when your friends thought they killed ali in new york
it was the perfect time to end it .
i left the country thinking it was over .
but the game ...
it &apos;s like a drug .
and i was really good at playing it .
and it felt great to succeed at something .
you attacked me in my own living room .
you were gonna leave , and i couldn &apos;t lose you again .
i @-@ i had to make it seem real
so you &apos;d pay attention .
i &apos;m not a bad person , ali .
you almost froze aria and spencer to death .
almost .
you drove a car through emily &apos;s house !
yeah , and i almost cut her in half too .
but is she hurt ? no .
is her mommy hurt ? no .
i only got mad when you didn &apos;t listen .
you can &apos;t steal people from their families
and lock them up to play with them like they &apos;re your toys .
yes , i can , and i did .
i know you won &apos;t believe me ...
but i love all of my dolls .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re still alive .
i would never let anything
really bad happen to them .
it sucks to kill someone .
even when they deserve it .
are you talking about wilden ?
he found out you were alive .
wilden was never gonna let you come back and tell your story .
who is that ?
you saw the body , right ?
tell me he can never hurt my sister again .
wilden &apos;s dead .
sorry , emily ... but not really .
oh , my god !
shut it off !
we all saw sara when they brought her out of the dollhouse .
are we supposed to think that that was an act ?
em , cece &apos;s messing with you .
she knows we &apos;re watching . she &apos;s still playing us .
that &apos;s why tanner is not here .
sara never called the cops .
i have to get out of here .
em , what are you doing ?
you &apos;re gonna hurt yourself .
get us the hell out of here .
there &apos;s no way to open this door .
spence ?
a always has an escape plan .
hey , one of these is not like the others .
the lights , they aren &apos;t randomly blinking on that one .
it &apos;s a constant pattern .
are you making yourself comfortable ?
getting you out of here .
stand back .
let &apos;s go . come on .
mona ?
i have to know how the story ends .
hanna . be careful .
we will .
before i saw you in new york ,
i snuck home to say goodbye to mom .
and when i got there , she ..
when i got there ... she ..
mom . mom !
mom ? mommy .
mom . mommy .
mommy .
mommy , n @-@ n @-@ no , no .
mom . mommy .
no , no , no .
no , no , no !
no .
come on , mommy , you can &apos;t leave me .
you can &apos;t leave me . you can &apos;t leave me . no .
mom was the only person who ever really loved me .
ali !
ali !
ali , where ..
get out of here !
all of you ! now !
i &apos;m begging you ... cece ..
... please don &apos;t do this .
damn it .
don &apos;t even think about it .
she &apos;s headed to the roof !
please help me .
i tried to keep you safe .
we may have a visual of the suspect on the roof .
no !
charlotte , please don &apos;t do this !
game over .
wow , you bring enough flip @-@ flops , em ?
it &apos;s malibu .
okay , well , you better not come back from savannah
talking like a southerner . you hear ?
hey , you better not come back from georgetown
talking like a politician .
yeah .
i , uh , heard that sara
got released from the hospital today .
what happened to sara that night wasn &apos;t our fault .
i doubt that &apos;s how she sees it .
you guys ...
i can &apos;t believe we &apos;re all actually leaving .
well , saying goodbye is a lot harder
than i thought it would be .
&quot; how lucky am i to have something
that makes saying goodbye so hard . &quot;
what brilliant scholar said that ?
winnie the pooh .
you gonna be okay ?
yeah ... i spent my whole life dreaming
about getting away from here .
but right now , this is the only place i wanna be .
love you .
love you too .
love you .
love you .
spencer .
bye , baby , hanna @-@ banana .
bye .
bye .
have fun .
you too .
thanks . drive safe , guys .
bye .
bye .
he &apos;s coming for you .
we have to go .
now , alison .
we came back here for you , ali .
so move it !
