第三季 第九集
happy friday , everybody .
what are you doing this weekend ?
the question is , who am i doing this weekend ?
he &apos;s asking because he &apos;s already forgotten .
it &apos;s nobody .
i &apos;m volunteering at the animal hospital .
aw .
animal hospital ?
the animals are the patients .
that makes sense .
yeah , dr. zizmor &apos;s letting me work off
the cost of daniel &apos;s eye surgery .
wait . you won &apos;t spend money on a name @-@ brand phone ,
but you got lasik for your geriatric cat ?
he only has the one eye , jeff .
i can &apos;t exactly buy him a cat monocle , can i ?
it &apos;s pretentious .
and for your information ,
this is a totorola .
troy and i will be having a very special saturday night ,
as in dark knight .
it came ! our limited @-@ edition , $ 299 dark knight dvd
with bonus footage , special commentary ,
and a christian bale autograph ,
including a personalized message of up to four words !
&quot; abed is batman now , christian bale . &quot;
it &apos;s official .
from the man himself .
may i have that back , annie ? thank you .
and just to clarify , if you see this lying out ,
i &apos;m still using it , so you don &apos;t have
to take it to the kitchen , dump it out , and wash the bowl .
is this about your buttered noodles ?
i didn &apos;t say that .
yes !
into your face !
your tears reveal your weakness !
what is it with those tools and foosball ?
they &apos;ve been at it for weeks .
i think they &apos;re european .
it &apos;s probably a more important game over there .
foosball &apos;s like the soccer of ping @-@ pong .
i can &apos;t take it anymore .
oh , jeffrey , let them be .
gentlemen , my name is clarence thaddeus foos .
my grandfather , fletcher morton foos ,
invented this game for one purpose--
to have the loudest , dumbest thing happen .
now it has .
the game of foosball is completed .
you &apos;re free to return
to your undoubtedly hearing @-@ impaired families .
tell you what , we &apos;ll stop playing ,
if you can score a point on us .
tempting , but then wouldn &apos;t i be playing foosball ?
and , if so , how would i not be a loud , weird knob ?
free shot .
i &apos;m not even touching the foosenschaften .
sorry , luftballons . i &apos;m above it .
i wish there was a word to describe the pleasure i feel
at viewing misfortune .
&apos;tis the face of a broken man .
jeff . smile .
they , uh , -- they come in a six @-@ pack .
buttered noodles .
i &apos;m allowed to throw out the dust , right ?
yeah .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i @-@ i ...
why ?
i stepped on it .
why ?
i was dusting the tv .
why ?
i can run out and get a new one before he gets home .
oh , sure , annie .
and--and then we just have to record
fake exclusive commentary by christian bale .
go ahead , you first .
this scene was a special challenge
to all involved--
stop it !
that &apos;s not a real option !
the disc is irreplaceably awesome !
what if we got a different disc , and--
annie , do you know how many sitcoms
have done the &quot; secretly replace a broken , priceless item &quot; thing ?
&apos;cause abed does .
abed knows everything ,
and i know you think you can think your way out of this
with your &quot; thinkiness , &quot; but don &apos;t think too much .
you just have to confess .
okay ?
okay .
we shot this scene on location--
okay , he &apos;s right . it won &apos;t work .
jeffrey ? what--what are you doing ?
hmm ? oh .
you know , i just thought ...
next time those deutsche @-@ bags try to show off ,
maybe i can catch them by surprise .
jeff , you don &apos;t need to worry what foreigners think about you .
that &apos;s your birthright as an american .
okay ...
small confession .
i used to love foosball .
it was a great after @-@ school game
for a lonely kid with no dad--
you know , just masculine enough
without having to know how to throw or catch .
i have seen you throw .
and it was fun ...
till i started getting bullied by people like those germans .
so i quit .
well , you did the right thing .
foosball is a vile game for vile people .
shirley , you wouldn &apos;t get it . it &apos;s a guy thing .
it &apos;s not a fresh @-@ baked @-@ pie thing .
well , i might get it a little .
you don &apos;t know me .
ho ... ly ... crap .
all right , i think i figured out the viewing order--
original version , director &apos;s cut ,
director &apos;s cut with commentary ,
and then original version cool @-@ down .
yeah , we &apos;ll see .
mm @-@ hmm .
oh , my god , you guys .
we &apos;ve been robbed !
oh , man .
i can &apos;t believe we got robbed .
shirley , shirley .
you have to teach me .
please , help me beat those evil power krauts .
don &apos;t you get it , jeff ?
they &apos;re not evil people that are good at foosball .
they are good at foosball because they &apos;re evil .
it &apos;s an evil game that brings out the worst in us ,
like--like out @-@ of @-@ town weddings where the reception &apos;s
in the same place as everybody &apos;s rooms ?
great . after three years of religious advice
and carb @-@ laden pastries ,
you finally have one thing i actually need , and--
i &apos;m sorry .
um , that was rude .
it--it shouldn &apos;t be so important to me .
i &apos;ll , uh ... i &apos;ll see you monday .
jeff ...
tomorrow , dawn--
be in the student lounge .
shirley , you are the best .
dear lord , please forgive me .
and please have mercy on him .
the stakes have never been higher .
shut up , leonard .
i found your youtube page .
what &apos;s the point in reviewing frozen pizza ?
you &apos;re talking about it .
well , that is true .
now , jeffrey ...
the key to winning foosball
is to tap into your darkness ,
so i need you to promise you won &apos;t judge
the side of me that might come out .
shirley ...
i &apos;m gonna be perfectly blunt with you .
the few times that you &apos;ve been a little bad
are the times i &apos;ve liked you most .
really ?
remember making fun
of britta &apos;s boyfriend &apos;s tiny nipples ?
oh , yeah , they were tiny .
remember what you did to pierce &apos;s hoagie ?
that was so disturbing , i almost proposed on the spot .
now , come on , show me how to dominate .
all right , winger , hands on the grips .
i &apos;m coming up on your right side
in three , two , one !
you know why you can &apos;t stop me ?
&apos;cause i &apos;m not playing a game .
for you , it &apos;s winning and losing .
for me , it &apos;s life and death .
that &apos;s how i win .
that &apos;s where you have to go .
no more thought , no more feeling .
kill or be killed . kill or be killed , little man .
think back to when this game mattered ,
before you got to be too cool .
stop acting like you &apos;re not ashamed right now .
follow that shame to the fear .
follow that fear to the rage .
you put that rage--aah !
up your ass , turkey . ha ha !
there &apos;s only two ways off this table--
kill or be killed .
say it .
kill or be killed .
i said say it , mumbles !
kill or be killed .
kill !
kill !
kill !
kill !
yeah !
you called me turkey .
i love it .
sorry we couldn &apos;t get a car over here until now .
our captain was killed on duty last night .
my god , i &apos;m so sorry .
yeah . good man--
leaves behind two kids and a pregnant wife .
so you &apos;re missing a batman dvd ?
my dark knight extended extended cut--it wasn &apos;t insured .
well , there &apos;s no sign of forced entry
on your door or windows .
you sure it wasn &apos;t just misplaced ?
someone definitely broke in .
some of my jewelry &apos;s missing .
you sure about that , annie ?
mm @-@ hmm . my necklace .
it was gold--white gold--
with emeralds .
and my name engraved in hebrew .
it was a bat mitzvah gift from my nana .
she was a rockette . she married a count .
he was blind . he loved her for her mind .
that &apos;s good color for the report ,
but i got to be honest ,
small stuff like this almost never turns up .
oh , no , abed .
we &apos;ll be in touch . say ...
you look familiar .
did i ever pretend to shoot a guy in front of you
to teach you about gun safety ?
i &apos;m really good at faces .
well , i guess the only upside to this is
it &apos;s brought us closer together as roommates .
something doesn &apos;t add up .
if there was no forced entry , it had to be an inside job .
we don &apos;t know that .
and instead of taking cash ,
pharmaceuticals , laptops , they take what ?
my batman dvd , and one piece
of oddly ornate hebrew @-@ themed jewelry ?
nana gave it .
it &apos;s smoke .
it &apos;s a ruse , a lie .
hmm ?
i think i know what happened here .
abed , i--
the landlord did it .
it all makes sense .
rick has keys to every apartment--means .
he knows when we &apos;re coming and going--opportunity .
and he was dressed as the joker for halloween--motive .
hmm .
something &apos;s got to be done .
oh , let &apos;s not leap to thing @-@ doing .
right , annie ?
double strike .
got it .
back blast .
viper shot .
nailed it !
oh , look ...
how cute--you do like foosball ,
you just have to practice with your mama .
what are you guys doing here on a saturday night ?
shouldn &apos;t you be making weird art movies
or well @-@ engineered cars ?
you take that back !
we came to play . get away from our table .
we &apos;re using it , strudel @-@ brain .
nice .
then play us for it .
fine . monday morning--
only let &apos;s make it interesting .
the losers never get to use this table again .
oh , you are so on that things have now
become very much like donkey kong .
we &apos;re gonna kick das butt .
nice .
thank you .
enough teutonic punnery .
monday morning you get this ...
were you guys walking around with a soccer ball
just so you could do that ?
they left the ball and everything .
i think they were literally walking around with it
like a prop to use .
that &apos;s , like , a $ 25 dollar bit , and it &apos;s not even that good .
you have got to come clean , okay ?
i don &apos;t know what he &apos;s doing in there , but it feels dramatic .
i &apos;m sure he &apos;s already moved on to some other obsession .
oh , look , fun .
the police are powerless .
i must take justice into my own hands .
men like rick operate above the law .
but there &apos;s something else above the law ...
bats ...
and me .
abed , don &apos;t do anything drastic .
yeah , maybe we should all just take a step back and--
aw , is that the grappling hook i got you for christmas ?
the night beckons .
its black fingers curl and uncurl ,
going , like , &quot; hey , come here . &quot;
abed , wait !
wait . i did it .
i stepped on your dvd , and it broke ,
and i staged a break @-@ in to cover it up .
if that were true ,
you would &apos;ve come forward a long time ago .
you &apos;re lying to keep me out of danger .
but there can be no peace
while crime spits and dances on the grave of justice
to the hot beats of infectious rhythms
of all that is wrong .
oh !
just ...
use your foot .
ooh , ooh , ooh !
you &apos;re okay--okay .
abed ...
troy ! what are we gonna do ?
now you &apos;re open to input ?
i &apos;m following him .
you moving in here was supposed to tone us down .
so , shirley , tell me--
how does someone with your talent for foosball
ever stop playing ?
oh , i don &apos;t want to talk about that .
oh , come on , we &apos;re , like , best friends now .
don &apos;t back away from this . open up to me .
okay , well ...
when i was a kid , i had anger , jeff--
real bad anger--and foosball was a release .
but i didn &apos;t just--just beat people .
i @-@ i broke &apos; em .
one time i was running this table
over at this y.m.c.a across town ,
and i was really giving it to this kid--
this skinny little white boy , no offense .
he started crying . they always started crying .
but something about this boy
made me want to take it all the way .
i started jabbing him with the rods until ...
the boy peed himself .
everybody laughed . i laughed .
but after that , the game lost its flavor .
once you make a boy pee his pants ,
you start thinking about where your life is headed .
jeff , what &apos;s wrong ?
gonna kill you !
your ass is mine !
you &apos;re such a punk !
you like being beat by a girl ?
yes !
what are you crying for ?
your mama cannot help you ,
and i know your daddy ain &apos;t around ,
or you wouldn &apos;t play like a bitch .
oh , my goodness gracious . is that what i think ?
i just beat this kid all the way to tinkle @-@ town .
tinkle @-@ town , tinkle @-@ town , tinkle @-@ town , tinkle @-@ town .
tinkle @-@ town , tinkle @-@ town , tinkle @-@ town ,
tinkle @-@ town , tinkle @-@ town .
you were big cheddar ?
who told you that--
oh , dear lord .
you &apos;re tinkle @-@ town ?
don &apos;t call me that .
all your fake sweetness and religion
is just a veil covering a horrible monster .
and i had a lot of mountain dew that day !
there &apos;s an 80 percent chance
you can &apos;t leave woodstock until you bone these hippies .
oh , boy .
you know what i came for , scum .
where is it ?
in the closet . in the closet , man .
abed , stop it !
get him !
i mean , stop it .
they &apos;re in the closet .
i knew i &apos;d get caught . just don &apos;t hurt me , batman .
closet .
women &apos;s shoes ?
but rick doesn &apos;t have a wife ...
or women &apos;s feet .
wait . my summertime ballet flats ?
i thought i lost these in the move .
is it there ? does he have the dvd ?
the what ?
the dvd .
he has it , all right .
and it looks like he broke it .
who are you ?
if you had something to say ,
why not put it in the text message ?
i wasn &apos;t sure what to say .
do you understand
what you did to me ... big cheddar ?
please don &apos;t call me that .
why not ? it &apos;s what you are--
a mean , nasty bully .
i was 12 years old .
i peed !
i had to change schools .
i changed everything--
my clothes , my hair , my personality--
because of you .
what a waste .
i wish i could take a picture of you right now
and send it to my ten @-@ year @-@ old self .
watch it , winger .
you don &apos;t have a trademark on self @-@ pity .
i will defend myself .
good .
bring the cheddar ...
big cheddar .
i &apos;m gonna put you on the express train
back to tinkle @-@ town !
argh !
uh !
uh !
aah !
uh !
aah !
aah !
aah !
die !
never !
argh !
argh !
ah !
you get it .
no , you get it .
you &apos;re the one that needs the advantage .
wrong . wrong !
every game i ever won , i won fairly .
foosball was how i measured my value as a man .
you took that away !
why do think i had to ?
you try sprouting three feet
just when boys are about to look at you .
everyone stopped liking me .
this game is all i had .
it &apos;s all i had .
well , that &apos;s stupid .
you &apos;re a perfectly fine person .
so are you .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
i &apos;m sorry , jeff .
you don &apos;t have anything to be sorry for , shirley .
so rick has agreed to stay out of your apartment
as long as you stay out of his .
and i &apos;m getting tired of saying this to people ,
but these things wouldn &apos;t happen
if you &apos;d invest in a simple shoe safe .
that &apos;s it ?
now we just live upstairs from this ...
guy that &apos;s really into footwear ?
sweetie , you &apos;re a renter .
look forward to owning a house .
be glad he &apos;s not into heads .
thanks for your help , officer ,
and if you should ever need me ,
i usually get out of school around 4 : 00 .
this guys sleeps outside your room , though , and that &apos;s okay ?
there &apos;s one thing i don &apos;t understand .
why would rick deny taking my dvd ?
and why break it ?
well , maybe he stepped on it by accident
and felt really , really , really bad .
all the more reason to confess .
well , not everybody &apos;s perfect , abed .
batman . and i am .
well , batman ,
on behalf of all of us that aren &apos;t perfect ,
can i just say i &apos;m sorry i broke your dvd ?
apology accepted .
but i wouldn &apos;t mention it to abed .
that guy &apos;s pretty ruthless .
and that &apos;s coming from batman .
hey , guys .
abed , where have you been ?
troy , really ?
let it go .
aw , black in the house !
my hand is cramping .
it &apos;s fine .
oh . hey , freudenkatzen .
ready for your schpankin &apos; ?
just like we practiced ?
let &apos;s shut &apos; em down .
ha ha ha . let &apos;s dance , david bowie .
get the ball , karl .
i &apos;m trying , and stop yelling at me .
stop being such a schvine !
aren &apos;t you guys playing foosball ?
we &apos;ve played enough for one lifetime .
we &apos;re gonna go see a movie .
since when are those two so close ?
hello . this is november 29th
and i &apos;m leonard ,
and today i &apos;m reviewing .
eugenio &apos;s four cheese frozen pizza .
that &apos;s $ 5.99 at kroger &apos;s .
i &apos;ve tried it before , and we &apos;ll see .
mmm !
mmm , the cheese is good .
the sauce is good too .
mm , well , it &apos;s definitely a buy .
eugenio &apos;s four cheese frozen pizza--
a buy .
see you next time .
* i &apos;m as high as hell *
