oh , god , i &apos;m so sorry . are you okay ?
you know there are easier ways to kill me ,
if you &apos;re worried i &apos;ll rat you out for cheating on the lsats .
what ? come on , rachel .
unbelievable .
rachel !
rachel , come on , let me buy you a fresh cup .
are you actually gonna buy it this time ,
or are you gonna steal it ?
okay , first of all , i don &apos;t steal , i cheat .
there &apos;s a big difference . and i don &apos;t do it anymore .
oh , great defense .
i &apos;m sorry , your honor , i know that i murdered her ,
but i promise i won &apos;t do it anymore .
look , i understand why you &apos;re mad ,
but i still don &apos;t think you &apos;re being entirely fair .
not fair ?
what &apos;s not fair is that you repeatedly help people skirt a system
that stands in the way of me becoming a lawyer .
you know what ? why don &apos;t you give up the whole saint act ,
since the only reason you figured out i was cheating
is &apos; cause you were thinkin &apos; about cheating yourself .
thinking about cheating and actually doing it
are two very different things , doctor analogy .
whoa ! wait , did i miss an apocalypse ?
where is everyone ?
you know , for someone with a freak brain ,
you manage to forget everything important .
follow me , but don &apos;t talk to me .
not bad , harvey .
the prague hotel , in the black in less than three years ,
and a successful i.p.o.
who said passion wasn &apos;t productive ?
i don &apos;t know anyone that &apos;s ever said that .
jones , tell me something .
you have 30 hotels in 12 different countries ,
but you spent last week in daniel vega &apos;s lisbon resort .
what ? just , you know , checkin &apos; out the competition .
that was more than a fact @-@ finding mission .
you &apos;re thinking merger .
do you honestly believe that i &apos;d do that
without talking to you first ?
i know you would .
then perhaps i did .
jones , if you try to pursue a merger ,
you may not control what happens to your business
that you built so passionately .
okay , sherlock , hear me out .
combined , we &apos;re 100 hotels in 23 countries .
i like having multiple homes .
but you don &apos;t need another name on the mortgage .
it &apos;s a good deal .
yeah , and it &apos;s my job to get you a better one , okay ?
promise me you didn &apos;t do a handshake deal .
donna !
who &apos;s ready for mock trial 2011 ?
what , like make @-@ believe trials ?
we gonna play monopoly after ?
this is your debutante ball .
the impression you make on the partners will last .
and let me guess , harvey was--
oh , legendary .
shocking .
sydney thompson was a consultant with lunders global initiative .
she had a few too many ,
and decided to entertain her friends
with an impersonation of her boss ,
lena lunders .
this impersonation was recorded
and uploaded onto a social networking site .
the next day she was fired .
sydney is now suing for wrongful termination .
we are looking to see how you do under pressure .
can &apos;t cheat your way out of this one .
the partners have been instructed to only use the associates
in emergency situations .
let the games begin .
all right . when your name is called ,
please step up and meet your match .
i think you mean my bitch , louis .
gene kaplan .
i &apos;m glad jessica finally chose a case
with a strong female character .
last year i was forced to play a traffic cop .
jocelyn lowenstein .
it was a total waste of my talent .
wait a minute , you play witnesses ?
oh , i don &apos;t play anything .
i embody .
and if i &apos;m on your team , you &apos;re a winner .
well , in that case--
no .
okay .
mike ross .
mike ross .
mike ross .
kyle for the plaintiff .
ross for the defendant .
may the best man win .
oh , by the way , kyle ,
weren &apos;t you , uh , national mock trial champion ?
that &apos;s right , louis . in high school ,
college , and law school .
i need an assessment of all of vega &apos;s hotels , okay ?
i want you to check annual earnings ,
property value .
there should be writing .
yeah .
this all doesn &apos;t sound like an emergency .
the mock trial-- okay .
i &apos;m on it .
uh , listen , harvey , about--
i don &apos;t give advice .
okay , please , sensei ?
i &apos;m out of my league with this thing .
listen to me . don &apos;t go to trial .
it &apos;s a mock trial .
i think the trial part is kind of a prerequisite .
all right . law is about control , okay ?
you can only control so much with a jury , judge ,
witnesses , and another lawyer with an ego complex .
what if the lawyer doesn &apos;t have an ego complex ?
every lawyer has an ego complex .
the firm has presented an exercise
where there &apos;s potential for failure , okay ?
all i &apos;m saying is try and create a situation
where that &apos;s not even a possibility .
kobayashi maru .
koba--what now ?
star trek . captain kirk .
he wins a no @-@ win situation by rewriting the rules .
you &apos;re a trekkie .
hey , captain kirk is the man ,
okay ? i don &apos;t wanna hear another word about it .
now , enough with your fake law problem .
let &apos;s deal with my real one .
aye , captain .
you wanna know how to do a cross ?
some people like to use big words .
some people like to go for sympathy .
but personally ,
i &apos;m a little more go for the groin .
hey , mike .
you mind dismissing the peanut gallery
so we can talk , kyle ?
i &apos;m sorry , guys .
looks like ross here came to plead for mercy .
if you &apos;re here for the witness / exhibit exchange .
don &apos;t bother .
i already know who you &apos;re gonna call
and what evidence you &apos;re gonna use .
actually , i &apos;m not gonna call any witnesses
or present any evidence . let &apos;s settle .
or i can beat you .
the plaintiff has shown a pattern of making
derogatory statements about my client .
hearsay .
not the emails .
which have no tone of voice
and are subject to interpretation .
which is exactly why your argument is shaky at best .
then beat me in court .
kyle .
there &apos;s a reason that harvey chose me to be his guy .
do you really wanna find out what that reason is ?
and how do i know this isn &apos;t some sort of trick ?
it &apos;s not a trick .
this is our chance to stand out .
look , settling gets us in and out of there
in five minutes .
you drop the suit , and you and i spend the rest of the week
making ourselves indispensable to the partners
while everyone else buries their heads
in candyland court .
i &apos;m going against my better judgment
and trusting you .
so we have a deal .
daniel , paperwork looks good ,
despite the fact that you two decided to go lawyer commando .
the devil &apos;s always in the details .
harvey , i know that impulse purchases
don &apos;t exist in your world , but the timing was right .
and as for the details ,
i &apos;d like to leave that to my man scott .
does he always like to be late ?
she .
just got off a plane from london .
meet ms. dana scott .
welcome .
hi . thank you .
scottie .
harvey .
oh , you two know each other !
we went to harvard law together .
harvey was fifth in the class , and i was--
oh , i forget . what was it ?
married to the library ?
that &apos;s right . number one .
number one at studying .
okay , this way .
tell me , scottie ,
what &apos;s my success rate against you in the real world
where we practice real law ?
harvey , there should be no winners or losers in a merger .
just a happy new couple .
that &apos;s right , 3 and 0 .
well , i say we let these two talk deal points
while i try your chef &apos;s famous sea bass .
absolutely . play nice .
we like each other , even if you two don &apos;t .
&quot; married to the library &quot; ?
it &apos;s not my fault that the library
was the best you could do .
do you have the preliminary proposal ?
no , i just flew in from london
completely unprepared .
try not to be intimidated . i use some big words .
overcompensation isn &apos;t that big of a word .
it isn &apos;t ?
i can hardly wait to see the work of a senior partner .
i see my promotion popped up
on your harvey specter google alert .
that &apos;s not all that &apos;s going to pop up .
can &apos;t remember the last time we had a bed .
pretty convenient that we &apos;re working on a hotel merger .
remember the mining deal ?
shaft 27 ? how could i forget ?
listen , about the due diligence--
ah , harvey .
you know the rules .
no case negotiations till we &apos;re done .
i think that might be a while .
couldn &apos;t resist seeing brilliance in action , huh ?
actually , i have to be here .
i &apos;m playing the part of the plaintiff .
wow . i knew you were pissed ,
but i didn &apos;t realize you were petty .
what does that mean ?
it &apos;s an adjective .
it means small @-@ minded and spiteful .
you chose to work with the one guy who &apos;s going against me .
kyle asked me , and i said yes .
you know what ?
it doesn &apos;t really matter , &apos; cause you &apos;re never gonna take the stand .
really ? how &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s a surprise .
but prepare to watch a mock trial legend be born .
is counsel ready to proceed with opening statements ?
we &apos;d like to submit a settlement agreement--
the plaintiff is ready , your honor .
which is it , counselor ?
the counsel for the plaintiff
and i agreed to a settlement yesterday .
he must &apos;ve misunderstood . we had discussed ,
but i never agreed to anything .
do you have a signed agreement ?
no .
then we are ready to proceed .
you have the floor .
thank you .
on march 31 , 2010,
sydney thompson was unwittingly recorded
on a cell phone .
she made a joke , the type of joke
that i &apos;m sure every person in this courtroom
has made at one point or another ...
mr. ross .
mr. ross !
are you ready ?
um , the , uh , the defense ...
according to bowmaster v. whitely ,
if the party to a settlement is surprised
by the repudiation of the settlement ,
then the court must provide a reasonable amount of time
to prepare for the trial .
reasonable time .
yes , your honor .
you get five minutes .
vega has more property .
debeque has more potential .
which is harder to monetarily define .
this isn &apos;t a library , scottie .
my guy &apos;s an up @-@ and @-@ comer .
that &apos;s why your guy &apos;s pouncing .
your client is an impulse shopper ,
which is what may have made him a quick success ,
but it could make him an even faster failure .
so he &apos;s a passionate guy .
he falls in love with a city ,
and he builds himself a hotel .
who are you to argue with his track record ?
i &apos;m a realist , and i have never seen a deal
pushed through so quickly .
so what ?
so your guy might wake up tomorrow
and decide that he doesn &apos;t wanna do this ,
which is why i &apos;m not showing you our private books
without a signed deal .
is that a joke ?
am i laughing ?
look , i may not have been awake during our m &amp; a clinic--
except for when you were copying my notes .
which was no walk in the park . you wrote like a monkey .
but in any case , due diligence is a requirement .
i have an obligation to my client .
then we don &apos;t have a deal .
and everyone &apos;s gonna know it &apos;s because you killed it .
you know ...
i don &apos;t see you rushing to show us your private books .
i have nothing to hide .
you can have full access to our books right now .
great . you show me yours ,
and i &apos;ll show you mine .
don &apos;t say it , harvey .
mike .
hey , are you okay ?
now you care ?
mr. ross , i &apos;m gonna have to ask you
not to speak to my client .
she &apos;s not your client .
she is rachel the paralegal .
and i only have five minutes ,
so you should really get out of my face .
what &apos;s your problem , mike ?
my problem is that
you don &apos;t have the balls to make this a fair fight , kyle .
lawyering isn &apos;t about fighting fair ,
and you &apos;d better watch your false accusations ,
or i might just sue you for defamation .
come on .
the defendant wishes to countersue .
on what grounds ?
i believe that &apos;s my line , counselor .
defamation of character .
the plaintiff &apos;s video negatively impacted
the perception of lena lunders
and impaired her financial well @-@ being .
that &apos;s ridiculous , your honor .
in order for there to be defamation ,
the statements made would &apos;ve been false .
that &apos;s not the case here .
then you should have no problem proving that in court .
the countersuit is allowed .
are you serious ?
would you like to approach the bench
and find out how serious i am ?
your honor , the defense should &apos;ve filed counterclaims
before the trial began .
yes , he should have .
but no one in this crop of associates
had the foresight to do so .
and we drafted a whole addendum
just because we assumed one of you would .
so i &apos;m going to allow it .
do you have a problem with that ?
no , your honor .
this is now a defamation trial .
you have until friday to prepare .
nice recovery . thinking on your feet .
but you wouldn &apos;t have had to
if you hadn &apos;t been so naive .
thank you , your honor .
how &apos;d the negotiation go ?
you come out on top ?
why didn &apos;t you tell me scottie was opposing counsel ?
because i didn &apos;t want you to have performance anxiety .
about the case . she &apos;s tough .
you &apos;re obvious .
and your fly &apos;s unzipped .
no , it isn &apos;t .
but it was earlier today .
you can do better .
ooh , is that what scottie said ?
type up the deal points .
i got her to cave . debeque &apos;s gonna run the show .
all i had to do was show her our books .
i can &apos;t believe it .
you gave me , like , the worst advice
anyone &apos;s ever given another person .
take the drama down a notch , juliet .
i tried to settle , and i got completely blindsided .
i told you to settle . i didn &apos;t tell you to be stupid .
what do you think &apos;s gonna happen in the real world ?
you have to be prepared for anything .
well , in the real world ,
i won &apos;t have to be looking for someone
to play my fake witness in my fake trial .
wait , wait , wait . what do you think ?
do you think witnesses are just gonna jump up
and present themselves ? &apos; cause they &apos;re not .
and sometimes when you have one ,
they disappear or recant .
and you know what you do ? you deal with it .
mock trial is about figuring out
what type of lawyer you wanna be ,
and there &apos;s only two types-- winners and losers .
that sounds great , harvey , but i haven &apos;t prepared .
i don &apos;t have anyone to play my client or my witness ,
and apparently i &apos;m going up against someone
that i can &apos;t trust .
figure out a way to beat him anyway .
winners don &apos;t make excuses when the other side plays the game .
hey , donna , i proofed that final agreement on the hotel merger .
quick question -- has harvey ever heard of spell @-@ check ?
oh , my god .
sorry .
are you--
no , no , no . it &apos;s okay . here .
no , no , no . you don &apos;t have to talk .
shh , shh , shh . it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s okay . he says things sometimes ,
and they--and they cut to the bone .
he does it to me too . i know , so ...
it &apos;s not bad , right ?
i can also do the demi moore single tear--
left eye or right eye-- if that &apos;s better for the character .
okay , i &apos;m scared . what &apos;s going on ?
if i &apos;m gonna play lena lunders for you ,
i need to be able to use my full range of emotions .
oh , my god . i love you .
yeah , i know .
focus .
you need another witness , and at this point ,
everybody else in the firm is booked up .
aw ! is mommy helping you clean up your mess , ross ?
am i mommy in this scenario ?
what ? uh ...
ross is just ... a baby .
oh , my god .
i cannot believe i &apos;m gonna lose to that tool .
okay , come on .
no pity parties . go to an outside source for the other witness .
for the best friend you need somebody pretty ,
sympathetic , and most importantly ,
willing to go above and beyond for you .
what are you doing here ?
jenny , come on , i need your help .
got nowhere else to go .
you yelled at me . kissed me . pushed me away . disappeared .
i haven &apos;t talked to you in forever .
i don &apos;t even know what &apos;s going on in your life .
well , if you let me in , i &apos;ll explain ,
and i promise it &apos;s a really good story .
so you &apos;ve been living a lie this whole time .
yeah .
that &apos;s awesome .
really ?
yeah !
i mean , as far as double lives go ,
you &apos;re maybe not as cool as clark kent , but still .
clark kent ?
okay , you &apos;re cut off .
what ?
nothing .
it just feels really good to tell you .
i don &apos;t really have anybody i can talk to about it .
you trust me .
yeah . i guess i do .
i like that .
ooh , but i really like this .
gotta hand it to you , harvey .
you may not be able to commit to a woman ,
but you have been in this place a very long time .
she gets me .
and has no needs .
i don &apos;t think you understand how high maintenance this place is .
he agreed to all your terms ...
despite my protest that he could do better .
so we &apos;re done .
minus a few signatures .
that &apos;s not done .
want me to leave ?
ladies and gentlemen of the jury , please note--
can i ask a question ?
no , you can &apos;t ask questions as a witness .
don &apos;t ask questions .
ladies and gentlemen , please--
yeah , okay , i know that .
but , um , what are you doing ?
what do you mean ?
you &apos;re walking around
like you have a giant stick up your ass .
it &apos;s a trial , jenny .
i have to be powerful .
but that &apos;s not you .
thanks .
no , you are charming , and funny ,
and trustworthy . that &apos;s your power .
and that &apos;s great when i &apos;m trying to con my way into the lsats ,
but this is a courtroom .
it &apos;s useless there .
but it &apos;s still you .
so ?
take a deep breath .
okay .
just talk to me .
ask me where do i work .
where do you work ?
lunders global initiative .
ask me how i know sydney .
how do you know sydney ?
she was my friend .
and i &apos;ve missed her every day that she &apos;s been gone .
and why aren &apos;t you friends anymore ?
i don &apos;t know .
if you do it like that ...
they &apos;ll fall in love with you .
would you take this off ? take it off .
take it ...
scottie , that was amazing .
careful , harvey .
you need to hydrate .
you just ran a marathon .
and i think you just beat me .
that &apos;s a lawyer look .
law school .
post @-@ mock trial in the library .
2nd circuit court of appeals .
class action on the prep room table .
dempsey settlement , in my office ,
on the desk and under .
so what are we doing ? um , a highlight reel ?
as a matter of fact , we are . those were top moments , right ?
they weren &apos;t bad .
no , they were great .
and i just realized this was better .
you were the best you &apos;ve ever been ,
and i know why .
why ?
you hid something from me in the negotiation ,
and i wanna know what .
you know what ? you are ridiculous .
oh , you know what ? don &apos;t do that , okay ?
do what ?
you think i don &apos;t know
victory sex when i see it , huh ?
see it ?
what is it ?
was it one of vega &apos;s properties is bankrupt ?
the buenos aires one ?
wh @-@ wh @-@ what do you want me to say , harvey ?
yes , you got me ! i screwed you .
how ?
oh , my god .
you want an anatomy lesson now ?
that &apos;s my shirt .
consider it a winner &apos;s reward .
hey , harvey .
you were right .
there &apos;s been a steady stream of stock buying
by vega &apos;s company in the last 24 hours .
it &apos;s a hostile takeover .
yeah , but why are they disguising it as a merger ?
they wanted access to our private books .
she tricked me .
what ?
she pretended she didn &apos;t wanna hand over their books
so i wouldn &apos;t notice when she asked for ours .
it &apos;s a classic maneuver .
she made me think it was my idea .
how do you know that ?
&apos;cause i taught her how to do it .
so now they see how strong debeque &apos;s company is ,
and they wanna buy it .
and they &apos;ll be running it by the time scottie &apos;s back in london .
wow . i leave you alone for two days ...
yeah , this is my mistake .
this is halley &apos;s comet .
take a good look , &apos; cause it won &apos;t happen again .
so what are you gonna do ?
i wanna know which of debeque &apos;s hotels are the most valuable
and how fast we can get them on the market .
wait , you want debeque to sell his best hotels ?
it &apos;s called the crown jewel defense .
we unload the highest grossing assets ,
and we make ourselves look undesirable .
debeque &apos;ll never agree to that .
trust me . debeque has enough passion for his company
that he &apos;ll be willing to chop off an arm to save the body .
okay .
you know you had that memorized the first time you read it , right ?
yeah , but i didn &apos;t finish reading it
because a certain witness chose to be distracting .
that must &apos;ve been rough for you .
yeah , you have no idea .
where can i get some water ?
i need to make sure my voice holds up .
right there .
i &apos;ll make you a deal .
the winner gets the girl .
you know , i &apos;m never gonna make another deal with you again .
no ? - why not ?
aren &apos;t you late for ...
oh , i am .
they remind me of a younger , less attractive you and me .
please don &apos;t say things like that .
and i know that you rigged the lottery
so that mike would get kyle .
please . rigged , expedited , they &apos;re all just words .
besides , don &apos;t you wanna see what your boy is made of ?
you talking bet ?
well , at least three &apos;s a number .
yeah .
usual amount .
i believe we have a wager .
well , you know what ? some of us shower before we go to work .
mr. specter--
you know what ? save it .
right .
how you feeling ?
good .
good ?
yeah .
good .
is it inappropriate to take a xanax
if you &apos;re a witness in a trial ?
i &apos;ve seen clients do much worse .
actually , i &apos;m not a client .
i &apos;m a witness in a friend &apos;s mock trial .
one thing-- if you get into trouble ,
don &apos;t play the case . play the man .
what are you talking about ?
good lawyers worry about facts .
great lawyers worry about their opponents .
kyle is cocky and devious .
figure out a way to use that against him .
okay . anything else ?
kick his ass .
who &apos;s your friend ?
oh , uh , mike ross .
do you know him ?
uh , yeah . uh , it &apos;s a big firm ,
but i know who he is .
yeah .
god , i don &apos;t know why i &apos;m so nervous .
i just know this is a big deal to him ,
and i don &apos;t wanna let him down .
sydney thompson was at a party and made a joke .
it wasn &apos;t meant to be mean or to be taken as fact ,
and it most certainly was never meant to be public .
the defense will show--
that sydney thompson chose to publicly
defame her boss with an impression
that she knew would be damaging ,
both to lena lunders &apos; reputation and her company .
i call lena lunders to the stand .
uh ... do you need a minute ?
no .
i can continue . thank you .
please .
i &apos;m a self @-@ made woman .
i created the global initiative
to target problems in third @-@ world countries .
i take my work very seriously ,
and if a joke can be made of that ,
fine .
but as a woman in power ,
people look at your success and label you .
they don &apos;t know the complexity it takes
for a woman to succeed in this business .
and when someone undermines that ,
well ...
we have to fight for ourselves ...
don &apos;t we , your honor ?
objection .
so it &apos;s hard to be a woman in business ?
that has nothing to do with the facts of this case .
well , we can only understand the damage
your client has done by fully understanding the care
with which miss lunders has built her reputation .
um , i &apos;m sorry .
can you ask me the question one more time ?
take a deep breath .
it &apos;s just you and me .
we &apos;re just gonna have a conversation about your job , okay ?
yeah , okay .
how do you know the defendant sydney thompson ?
we were coworkers . we started at the same level ,
and then i was promoted to be her immediate superior .
and do you know about the video in question ?
yes . i was at the party that night .
and what were you celebrating that night ?
my promotion .
same night . that &apos;s interesting .
miss ginnesse .
what did you think of the impersonation ?
it was too far . it was mean .
so why do you think miss thompson did it ?
miss lunders promoted me .
sydney hated it .
and that &apos;s why she made the video .
well , thank you , miss ginnesse .
nothing further , your honor .
did sydney ever tell you
that she hated your promotion ?
not exactly .
yes or no , please .
no .
well , then how do you know
that she hated your promotion ?
i could just tell .
can you tell what i &apos;m thinking right now ?
that you &apos;re wishing i would agree with everything you say ?
no . i was thinking that if you could actually read my mind ,
i wouldn &apos;t bother asking you the questions .
but you can &apos;t read my mind , can you ?
no , i &apos;m--i &apos;m managing director--
no . and i &apos;m pretty sure you can &apos;t read sydney &apos;s either .
and you actually have no idea why she made that video .
correct ?
i guess i don &apos;t . no .
good afternoon , miss scott .
thank you .
are you here to give me a proper send @-@ off ?
i don &apos;t think we can do that out here on the street .
you sure ?
you tricked me .
i &apos;m impressed .
to be fair , vega did want a merger .
i just convinced him that ,
given your client &apos;s propensity for rash purchases ,
that allowing him to stay in charge was a bad idea .
vega needed debeque &apos;s hotels minus debeque ,
and i found a way .
one that he never asked for or wanted ,
and one that he &apos;s never gonna get .
was--is this for real ?
three of debeque &apos;s properties .
it &apos;ll be on the market by the end of the day .
he &apos;s never gonna let you sell off his crown jewels .
see , that &apos;s the thing about passionate clients .
when they &apos;re crossed , they get angry ,
and they &apos;ll do anything to get back .
don &apos;t do this , harvey .
look , there &apos;s another way we can do this .
we can get our clients into a room together .
you can tell them you were wrong ,
and we can convince them back into a merger .
miss thompson , what was the intent behind your impersonation ?
i was just trying to be funny .
everyone in our office makes jokes ,
and as a matter of fact ,
ms. lunders encourages us to be informal .
i can &apos;t win this just on facts .
but i expected it .
i think everyone has the impulse to move up ,
but at a certain point , you just have to let it go .
so that &apos;s what i did .
what are you gonna do ?
i &apos;ve never held ill will for my boss .
i &apos;m gonna play the woman , not the case .
you say you expected to be passed over for a promotion , correct ?
yes .
and yet you applied three times ?
yes .
and you were never promoted ?
as i said , yes .
and when nora ginnesse was promoted ,
you wrote scathing emails to the rest
of your coworkers in response .
no , not scathing .
the intent was to be funny .
oh , right , you like to be funny .
who doesn &apos;t like to laugh ?
someone whose reputation has been ruined .
objection .
just a thought .
it &apos;s testifying .
sustained .
mr. ross , questions .
i &apos;m sorry , your honor .
forgive me . i was just trying to be funny .
on your performance review , lena lunders wrote ,
&quot; good work ethic . lacks skills . &quot;
do you think that &apos;s a fair assessment ?
fair ? i--i don &apos;t know .
well , your coworkers were promoted ,
and your boss was calling you mediocre .
are you mediocre ?
no .
so why haven &apos;t you been promoted ?
i don &apos;t know .
do you think you deserve better ?
doesn &apos;t everyone ?
so why haven &apos;t you tried ?
i have tried .
why haven &apos;t you improved ?
i didn &apos;t say i haven &apos;t improved .
well , your review did .
your five years without a promotion did .
look , you were so angry that you weren &apos;t moving forward
that you lashed out at your boss--
no .
objection ! testifying !
everyone was moving past you .
so what ?
people making good on their--
badgering , your honor .
sustained .
people who could cut it .
i can cut it !
excuse me , your honor .
settlement &apos;s still on the table .
what ?
let &apos;s settle .
same deal . win @-@ win .
no , i &apos;m good .
excuse me ?
i &apos;ve seen the moony looks , ross .
you like her ,
so you &apos;re offering me a settlement
because you don &apos;t want to hurt her feelings .
but i &apos;d rather see if you &apos;ll break her .
giddy @-@ up , cowboy .
counselor .
would you like to proceed ?
no , your honor .
are you sure ?
yes , your honor .
nothing further .
well , normally we &apos;d move on to closing statements ,
but it &apos;s been a long week , and honestly ,
we all know where this is going .
so court rules in favor of the defendant .
this court is adjourned .
mr. ross .
naive and soft .
not qualities we &apos;re looking for at pearson hardman .
gentlemen , i appreciate you leaving the swords at home .
what started off as a true merger
never needed to become anything different .
daniel , i want you to listen to me .
i know harvey , and he just wants to merge your businesses
so he can double his billable hours .
quiet , scott .
i wanna hear what he has to say .
i &apos;m just here to get my client the deal that he wants ,
and what he wants is a merger , is that right , jones ?
that &apos;s right .
daniel your law firm overreached in a situation
where it wasn &apos;t necessary .
it &apos;s not entirely scottie &apos;s fault .
we lawyers all have an instinct to win ,
but sometimes we may
not fully understand what that means .
we understand what it means .
well , maybe you do , and maybe you don &apos;t .
for me ,
it would be to see both men return to the initial deal
so that you can grow both your businesses ,
instead of having one company with a hostile reputation
and the other a shell of what it once was .
i mean , that doesn &apos;t sound like a win to me .
i &apos;m sorry .
let &apos;s just go back to the original deal .
we can run it together .
you need anything ?
&apos;cause otherwise i &apos;m gonna head out .
celebratory drinks with the associates ?
yep .
and what exactly are you celebrating ?
you know what ?
you can save the disappointment , harvey .
i know what i did .
do you ?
because what i saw is that you backed off
because you were worried about hurting your girlfriend &apos;s feelings .
it was a fake trial .
all right ? i weighed the pros and the cons ,
and i decided it wasn &apos;t worth hurting someone for the result .
the result is you just told every partner in this firm ,
including myself , that you have a weak stomach ,
that you don &apos;t have what it takes .
you know , you keep telling me that i have to decide
what kind of lawyer i wanna be .
and if i were smart , i &apos;d probably be just like you ,
because everybody knows you &apos;re the best .
but i &apos;m also trying to decide what kind of person i wanna be .
and sometimes i like my kind of person
a lot more than yours .
you wanna know what kind of person i am ?
tough but fair .
i call it like i see it .
and what i see is a kid who asked for an opportunity
who still hasn &apos;t decided if he wants it or not .
single malt , please .
harvard club ? i thought you hate this place .
vega kicked me out of his hotel ,
so , you know , beggars ...
save the pout .
you were head of law review ,
you clerked for a supreme court judge ,
and you almost beat me .
i think that deserves a drink .
on you .
i &apos;d laugh , but i just got fired .
from the firm ?
no .
but the firm &apos;s not going to be happy ,
and that &apos;s why i &apos;m not already on a plane .
hey , the scottie i know is tougher than that .
is she ?
well , you wanna go back to our alma mater
and see a lecture on why women are better at science ?
might cheer you up .
maybe , but i &apos;m not going with you .
come on , we &apos;re still friends , aren &apos;t we ?
i &apos;m getting married , harvey .
his name is steve , and , uh ,
he asked me a month ago , and , um ,
when i get back to london i &apos;m--
i &apos;m going to say yes .
what would you like me to say ?
nothing .
come here .
i &apos;m sorry i won .
no , harvey ...
i would hate it if you were sorry about that .
you didn &apos;t have to do that , you know .
i know .
i could &apos;ve handled it .
i know .
that was a thank @-@ you ,
if you couldn &apos;t tell .
i could tell .
so , um , jenny was a great witness .
really likeable and pretty .
yeah . yeah , she is .
i know i was hard on you this week .
it &apos;s okay--
no , it--
did you ever take a minute to wonder
why i was so mad at you ?
i just expect more from you than most people .
why ?
you &apos;re a smart guy .
