hostage
you &apos;re gonna get us all in trouble .
he &apos;s going to be home soon , ok ?
stop !
rose ?
rose !
don &apos;t call me that .
how many times have i told you ?
you took that when i was watching
and he &apos;s gonna blame me .
please .
stop that !
i &apos;m gonna go get help .
d @-@ don &apos;t go .
you &apos;re sick . you need help .
i &apos;ll be back .
pinkie promise ?
ok .
i &apos;m sorry . i couldn &apos;t stop her .
we have to go .
where ?
now .
i need help . i can &apos;t lift her .
she &apos;ll only slow us down .
but we can &apos;t--
come on , put her down !
go ! now !
last night , this girl , gina bryant ,
flagged down a police car in st. louis .
she was wearing nothing but a dirty nightgown
and she was barefoot .
and she told them that she had been kidnapped when she was 8 .
that girl &apos;s gotta be 19 or 20 years old .
18 . and they confirmed her identity .
she was a foster kid who disappeared 10 years ago .
she &apos;s been in captivity this whole time ?
long @-@ term hostage . that &apos;s rare .
we got another ariel castro here ?
funny you should say that . not funny ha ha , funny weird .
she told the police that she was held captive with this girl ,
sheila woods , 15 years old ,
who disappeared from nashville 7 years ago .
also she said there was another girl , too ,
but all she knows about her
is that her name is violet and she was older .
i &apos;m assuming you &apos;ve checked the missing children &apos;s database .
affirmative . there &apos;s no violet anywhere .
did gina say anything about her captor ?
just that his name is tom and he was an older white dude .
and where were they being held ?
this house . gina took the cops there .
they found sheila . sheila &apos;s at the hospital ,
very ill with something yet to be determined .
violet nowhere to be found .
it &apos;s probably safe to assume that she &apos;s with the unsub .
who owns the house ?
oh , that &apos;s where it gets even weirder .
this woman , clara riggins .
she &apos;s mia , but her checking account is active ,
she pays her bills on time , and if my math is correct ,
she &apos;s 108 years old .
i might be going out on a limb here ,
but i &apos;m gonna bet she had nothing to do with the kidnapping .
the real question &apos;s where is the unsub
and this other girl violet ?
that &apos;s what we &apos;re gonna find out .
can i go pee ?
soon .
when ? we &apos;ve been driving for hours .
soon . i said .
i gotta go bad .
what &apos;d i say , huh ?
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;ll hold it .
i &apos;ll be good , i promise .
maybe i should just get rid of you .
i &apos;m sorry ! i &apos;m sorry !
&quot; by the will art thou lost ,
by the will art thou found ,
by the will art thou free , captive , and bound . &quot;
angelus silesius .
both gina and sheila were grabbed when they were 8 .
and both just blocks away from their homes .
and made a clean getaway each time . no witnesses .
there &apos;s an excellent chance he stalked them .
clean getaways usually mean they know daily routines
and are familiar with the area .
so this guy &apos;s patient and has a plan .
which means he has patterns , too .
this guy &apos;s more than just a preferential pedophile .
his victims are children ,
but that &apos;s probably more about establishing control .
long @-@ term captivity is what matters to him .
we &apos;ve seen profiles like this before .
there &apos;s always a sexual assault component to their m.o.
hello , all . i just sent you the 4 @-@ 1 @-@ 1
on the statements from police reports .
turns out the neighbors haven &apos;t seen clara riggins in 20 years .
most of them didn &apos;t even know that she existed .
but they all know who this tom guy is .
according to this one lady ,
tom told her that he was clara &apos;s grandson .
but i triple @-@ checked . clara doesn &apos;t have any relatives anywhere .
did we get a description from any of the neighbors ?
affirmative .
and they also gave me the make and model of tom &apos;s blue van .
it &apos;s a pretty common vehicle .
i got a long list of registered owners .
so far the 3 toms and thomases on that list all check out .
all right , stay on it .
you know i will , sir .
when we land , dave , you and morgan go to the house .
jj , you and reid are with me at the hospital .
we need to talk to the girls
and find out everything they remember .
well , she &apos;s stable for now .
all we can do is wait .
so , just sit tight .
agents , thank you for waiting .
of course . how is she ?
looks like she had complications from a miscarriage .
her infection turned septic .
we had to perform an emergency hysterectomy .
and she has several old scars on her back .
if i didn &apos;t know better , i &apos;d say they were from a whip .
any idea when she might wake up ?
there &apos;s no way to tell .
what about gina bryant ?
she &apos;s doing much better , all things considered .
malnourished , dehydrated , a couple nasty cuts and bruises .
but she should be ok . physically , anyway .
do you think she &apos;s able to answer a few questions ?
she was pretty agitated when she came in ,
so we gave her a mild sedative .
but she has the same scars on her back ,
and she &apos;s got a bunch of old injuries that didn &apos;t heal properly .
broken ribs , tibia , a couple of fingers .
i hope you catch the guy who did this .
do you feel better ?
much better . thank you .
ok .
sorry i yelled .
daddy &apos;s just got a lot on his mind , all right ?
it &apos;s ok .
hi , gina .
my name &apos;s jennifer .
this here is my friend spencer .
hi .
we &apos;re with the fbi .
do you know what that is ?
the police ?
yeah . something like that .
i already talked to the police .
well , we &apos;re--we &apos;re a little bit different .
do you mind if we ask you a few questions ?
can you tell me about the day you were kidnapped ?
i went to the park .
i forgot my sweatshirt .
but i didn &apos;t want to go home .
why not ?
that lady trisha was mean .
your foster mother , trisha ? trisha gilmore ?
her kids , too .
they said i wasn &apos;t worth the money they made off me .
so you went to the playground to get away from them .
i went all kinds of places .
mostly there .
what happened that day ?
i saw violet .
violet .
the girl you were held hostage with ?
she was waiting for her dad to pick her up .
and that &apos;s when he came .
who , tom ?
hey , girls , look what i have .
he had this little puppy .
he asked me if i wanted to give him treats .
he said he went crazy for treats .
they were in his car .
but it wasn &apos;t a car .
it was a van .
and he opened the door
and pushed me in and he hit me .
i tasted my blood , and my eyes were watery .
he said i &apos;d better listen or he was gonna hit me again .
we drove ...
we drove for a long time .
but i never saw the puppy again , though .
never saw it .
he was so little .
i don &apos;t know where he went , though . i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s ok . it &apos;s ok .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry . shh ...
look what i found in the kitchen .
bondage and torture porn .
also found another toolbox in there .
that makes 3 .
well , you saw the guy &apos;s woodwork .
he &apos;s obviously good with his hands .
so maybe some kind of carpenter or handyman .
check this out .
it could be ocd .
i mean , his closet is just right .
clothes are perfectly folded .
you can even bounce a quarter off his bed .
he wants total control over every aspect of his life .
makes sense for a sadist .
he &apos;s not gonna like being on the run .
he &apos;s gonna feel powerless .
and that &apos;s why he took violet with him .
sheila woods was probably too sick to travel .
you know , violet was the oldest and helped with the abductions .
she was probably his first victim .
or maybe his daughter .
well , either way , she was important to him .
you know , i also wonder , what happened to clara riggins ?
well , the bedroom down the hall is untouched .
looks like it &apos;s been that way for a while .
this house is well cared for .
he looked after it .
that could be how he found this place .
elderly woman with no family
hires someone to fix things now and then .
he &apos;s a nice guy . he does good work .
they build a relationship .
you think he took advantage of clara riggins .
yeah .
right before he murdered her .
i don &apos;t know , rossi . this guy doesn &apos;t profile as a killer .
he likes the long game .
so maybe he just insinuates himself into her life
and waits for her to die .
and he made sure that she came to depend on him for survival
just like his victims .
gina , do you have any idea
where tom might be right now ?
maybe his disappearing place .
his disappearing place ?
he &apos;d always leave . i liked it when he was gone ,
even though he never left much food .
do you know where the disappearing place is ?
i didn &apos;t get to go . he only took violet
and sheila once .
they were more special .
why were they more special ?
because they were good .
they never fought .
but you did .
i hated to call him daddy , and i wouldn &apos;t say my name .
what do you mean , you wouldn &apos;t say your name ?
rose .
he tried to call me that .
did sheila or violet every talk about the disappearing place ?
it &apos;s a secret . it would make tom mad if they did .
well , what about tom ? did he ever talk about it ?
one time .
when he was nice .
he brought pizza .
do you remember what he said ?
that maybe one day i could go .
then ...
then he wanted to go behind the curtain .
sometimes i didn &apos;t fight as much after sheila got there .
why not ?
because we had to take care of her .
so i tried to make him happy .
but i made sure she remembered her real name
no matter what .
what about violet ? do you know her real name ?
just--just violet .
sometimes he called her vi .
did tom ever mention anyone named clara ?
she liked flowers . that &apos;s where we got our names .
he called sheila daisy .
did you ever see clara ?
no .
but sometimes i was good
and he let me go outside at nighttime ,
and we planted flowers .
he said they were for clara .
no , it was--
it was just like any other day .
i made her lunch , i kissed her goodbye ,
and then her school called wondering where she was .
is there anyone you &apos;d like me to contact ?
her father .
he &apos;s in tampa .
we split up after sheila disappeared .
who did this to her ?
who ?
rest assured we &apos;re doing everything we can to find him .
so this one right here will turn the volume up and down .
and then this one if you want to change the channel ,
if you want to watch something different .
jj .
here you go . i &apos;ll be right back .
composite sketch of the unsub .
garcia &apos;s running facial recognition
against her list of blue van owners .
how &apos;s she doing ?
it &apos;s a lot .
she has no money , no family ,
a second @-@ grade education ,
not to mention a lifetime of ptsd to deal with .
clear the door , clear the door , please .
103 . code blue .
that can &apos;t be good .
dr. givens , room 103 . code blue .
crash cart coming through .
given the amount of hospital staff and the level of urgency ,
it looks to me like sheila might be coding .
what &apos;s coding ?
gina , you need to get back in bed .
is that sheila &apos;s room ?
no , no , no . ok , you know what ?
let them work . you don &apos;t want to get in their way .
no ! you don &apos;t stop working on her ! you keep working on her !
seila ! is she ok ?
no no no .
sheila ! sheila ! what &apos;s wrong ? !
what &apos;s wrong with her ? !
i have to help her ! i have to help her !
please ! please ! please ...
what have you got , garcia ?
i have a big fat hit on our unsub .
i give you michael clark thompson ,
owner of mike &apos;s fix @-@ it and construction ,
and there &apos;s a blue van registered in the company &apos;s name .
you sent the address ?
no , it &apos;s a p.o. box , sir ,
and his cell phone is turned off .
but it last pinged last night in st. louis ,
right next to clara riggins &apos; house .
is this him ?
yeah . get it away , please .
i &apos;ll issue the apd .
here .
eat . i know you &apos;re hungry .
can we please go see them ?
shut up and eat your cheeseburger .
now , listen .
just let me sleep for a little while ,
then i &apos;ll take you to see them .
ok . ok . i &apos;ll be quiet .
i &apos;ll be quiet as a mouse .
i just need a few minutes .
sweet dreams .
i thought you said you &apos;d be quiet .
michael clark thompson &apos;s mother died in childbirth ,
so he grew up with his father nate ,
who was married and divorced 5 different times .
and each of exes filed for divorce
on the grounds of cruelty , adultery , or both .
apparently his father had a predilection for prostitutes .
he was even arrested once for having assaulted one .
now , kids do what they see .
this might explain the son &apos;s extreme misogynistic tendencies .
and his violent streak .
the apple doesn &apos;t fall too far from the tree .
this man is smart , and he &apos;s manipulative .
he not only was able to
take advantage of the woman who owns this house ,
but he &apos;s somehow held 3 girls hostage here for over a decade .
that took effort and dedication .
this was important to him , like a compulsion .
he gets off on having absolute power and control .
all units be advised ,
apb suspect blue van
spotted on taft avenue and buckley road .
that &apos;s him .
michael clark thompson , fbi !
show me your hands !
daddy , who is that ?
show me your hands !
now very slowly use your right hand
to open the driver &apos;s side door .
daddy ?
slowly .
remember what i told you .
that if anybody ever found us ,
daddy &apos;s the only one that loves you .
get out of the van nice and slow .
keep your hands where i can see them .
ah , you gotta be kidding me , this guy .
oh , god ! oh , my wrist ! my wrist !
oh , what , am i hurting you ? i &apos;m sorry .
shut up .
it &apos;s ok . it &apos;s ok .
we got you .
she &apos;s refusing treatment .
she won &apos;t even tell us her last name .
well , that &apos;s because she might not even remember it herself .
violet probably isn &apos;t even her real name .
it &apos;s most likely the name he gave her .
we do need to talk to her .
well , you can try . you might have better luck than i did .
it may take some time to get through to her .
all right , see what you can find out .
i &apos;m gonna go question thompson .
she &apos;s probably childlike and unsocialized , exactly like gina .
and if she was held captive the longest ,
she almost certainly fell victim to intense trauma bonding .
hi . violet ? my name &apos;s jennifer .
and i &apos;m spencer .
uh , can we go now ?
me and my daddy , we gotta go .
when you say daddy , do you mean tom ?
i don &apos;t call him that .
you know , that &apos;s-- that &apos;s not actually his real name .
his name is michael clark thompson .
tom &apos;s just a name he made up .
kind of like your name-- violet .
do you remember your real name ?
i need my daddy . we need to go .
where is it that you need to go ? maybe we can help you .
he said you would do that .
do what ?
ask questions and lie .
especially about him .
we know what he did to you , violet .
gina told us everything .
you found her ?
did you find daisy , too ?
her real name is sheila . sheila woods .
and , yes , we did .
she was super sick . is she ok ?
i &apos;m sorry , but , no , she &apos;s not .
the doctors did everything they could ,
but she didn &apos;t make it .
she died .
you don &apos;t have to be afraid of him anymore .
we can help you .
he said you would say that , too .
you don &apos;t know anything , ok ?
i would be dead without him .
he &apos;s the only one who loves me .
violet , please .
i--i gotta go . please .
i &apos;ve been good . i haven &apos;t done anything bad .
can i go now ?
please .
i gave them a good life .
they were clothed , fed .
you repeatedly raped and tortured them .
children need discipline .
now , if you have kids yourself , you know what--
that wasn &apos;t discipline and they &apos;re not your children .
the hell they weren &apos;t . i saved them .
from what ?
from their parents .
nobody cared about them .
where were they when i showed up ?
no one cared about them but me .
what about clara riggins ?
she was a nice lady .
who seems to have disappeared .
huh . i didn &apos;t kill her .
i didn &apos;t say that you did .
no , but obviously that &apos;s what you &apos;re thinking .
so where is she ?
i went to check on her one day
and she didn &apos;t answer the door .
i had the key , so i let myself in and i found her ,
just lying on the kitchen floor .
so i put her in the yard .
that &apos;s what she would have wanted .
look , she loved that house .
she didn &apos;t want to be buried next to strangers .
you can go check if you want .
i told you , i &apos;ve got nothing to hide .
nothing to hide , my ass . he &apos;s full of it .
the preliminary m.e. report does suggest
that clara riggins died of natural causes .
i think he &apos;s telling the truth about that . he didn &apos;t kill her .
i &apos;m sorry , guys . i can &apos;t stop thinking about violet .
she could not wait to get out of here ,
like it was urgent . it &apos;s all she could talk about .
well , she &apos;d been held captive most of her life .
all this has to be a tremendous shock .
no question about that , but that wasn &apos;t it .
it &apos;s like she had somewhere specific in mind
and she needed thompson to go with her .
well , he &apos;s conditioned her to depend on him for everything .
exactly . you condition someone
by doing something over and over again .
now , we know he repeatedly abused them .
i don &apos;t think she was itching to get out of here to go do that .
maybe he did something to reward her somehow .
what if she has a child ?
where else would you want to go so badly ?
you know , that &apos;s not a stretch .
sheila woods had a miscarriage .
maybe violet brought one to term .
we did profile he might be trying to fill some kind of void
since he didn &apos;t have a family .
yeah , but ina bryant never mentioned any baby .
well , violet could have had the baby before gina was abducted .
gina wouldn &apos;t even know about it .
we , if we &apos;re right about any of this ,
that means there &apos;s another kid somewhere out there .
then who &apos;s taking care of it ?
i wove my webs for you because i liked you .
after all , what &apos;s a life anyway ?
we &apos;re born , we live a little while , we die .
a spider &apos;s life can &apos;t help being something of a mess ,
with all this trapping and eating flies .
i don &apos;t want to listen anymore .
i &apos;m hungry .
i know . me , too .
you want to sing ?
how about &quot; a @-@ b @-@ cs &quot; ?
you remember it ?
yeah .
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;ll be right there with you .
don &apos;t leave .
i promise .
excuse me , mrs. woods .
i am so sorry to interrupt here ,
but ... this is gina .
she was with sheila .
i &apos;m sorry .
i tried to help her .
i tried .
yeah , garcia .
sir , i think i found who violet is .
the timeline matches , the geography matches ,
everything matches .
hi .
you ok ?
how is daddy ? can we go soon ?
um , we &apos;re working on it .
you know , i still have a few questions i need to ask you .
ok ?
what &apos;s that thing ?
um , well , you can look at pictures on it .
do you know this little girl ?
her name is amelia hawthorne ,
and she is from a city called indianapolis .
and these-- these are her parents .
that &apos;s george and maureen .
that little girl
is you .
you &apos;re amelia .
um ... my name is violet .
no , sweetie .
tom took you away from your family when you were only 8 .
you have been gone for 15 years .
tom is not your daddy .
this man is .
i--i can &apos;t even begin
to understand what you &apos;re feeling right now ,
but you must be scared and confused .
i promise you , amelia ,
i am your friend .
ok ? and i &apos;m here to help you .
you gotta trust me . ok ?
ok .
can you do me a favor ?
i need you to think back
and try really hard to remember .
did tom ...
did he ever get you pregnant ?
did you have a baby , amelia ?
i can &apos;t talk about that . he gets mad .
he &apos;s not here .
he gets mad if i even ask about about--
i promised you ,
i am here to help you .
which means you never , ever have to worry about him again .
my sisters .
your sisters ?
i got super sick .
and then my belly got really big both times .
both times ? it happened twice ?
and then one day , they just ...
came out ,
and it really hurt like crazy ,
but i got my sisters .
lily and jasmine .
do you know where they are right now ?
of course . they &apos;re in the disappearing place .
do you know where that is ? i can take you there .
we have to drive . can you drive ?
yeah , but you need to tell me where to go .
can you do that ?
no . i don &apos;t know-- i don &apos;t know where it is .
i always sit in back . he drives .
well , you might remember more than you think .
no . daddy knows . he can drive .
just go and get him . go get him and we can go .
go ahead . take it .
what about you ?
i &apos;m ok .
he &apos;ll be back soon .
here .
thanks .
all right . thank you .
the x @-@ ray machine was down .
thompson &apos;s going in now .
amelia hawthorne &apos;s parents are here .
she could barely look at their photo .
i can &apos;t imagine how she &apos;ll react in person .
wait . maybe we should give her more time .
psych hasn &apos;t completed a full evaluation yet .
i mean , she could become hostile
or maybe even retreat into a catatonic state .
we don &apos;t have time . amelia may have information
about the missing children
that her parents could help unlock .
it &apos;s a calculated risk , but one i think we have to take .
i &apos;ll go update them .
ok .
hi .
did you get daddy ? is he gonna take us ?
uh , no , not yet .
why not ?
uh , there &apos;s-- there &apos;s some people here
that would like to see you .
amelia .
who are they ?
they &apos;re your real parents .
baby , it &apos;s me . it &apos;s mama .
i don &apos;t know you .
i know . i look different .
so do you .
i don &apos;t know them .
see ? that &apos;s how i looked back then .
and that &apos;s your dad .
and that right there ...
is you .
do you remember ?
don &apos;t touch me .
oh , melly .
what did you say ?
m @-@ melly .
it &apos;s what i used to call you .
it &apos;s short for amelia .
all right , get a hit , melly , melly .
daddy &apos;s the only one that loves you .
daddy , daddy .
get out .
‭ - oh , baby--
get out !
get out ! get out ! get out ! get out !
get out ! get out now !
now ! get out !
i want to go home !
i want my daddy !
i need my daddy !
excuse us , please .
i don &apos;t think he was done .
we know that sheila woods got pregnant and miscarried .
she preferred to be called daisy .
and we know about lily and jasmine . where are they ?
i want a deal .
tell me where they are
and i will make sure the court knows you cooperated .
no .
no , no , no .
i want a deal .
if we find them alive , then we can discuss terms .
listen to me . the only reason i haven &apos;t asked for a lawyer yet
is because i hate those lying sons of bitches .
now , you either give me a
damn deal right now or i ain &apos;t sayin &apos; boo .
what do you want ?
that &apos;s better .
i want to do my time in minimum security .
one of those places where they send the white collar guys ,
with the tvs and the gyms .
and no life sentence .
i won &apos;t die in there .
‭ - is that all ?
no .
i want to see violet .
that &apos;s not happening .
come on . what are you telling me ,
she didn &apos;t ask for me , not even once ?
ok . all right .
you let your pride get in the way .
lily , jasmine , i only left them enough water for a few days
and i &apos;ve been gone almost a week .
but that &apos;s on your head , not mine .
are we really gonna make a deal with this guy ?
i don &apos;t think we have a choice .
you think he &apos;s telling the truth
about their food and water ?
i do . and i think we &apos;re running out of time .
are we even sure the a.u.s.a. will approve a deal ?
they just did .
well , do her parents know about this ?
jj &apos;s talking to them now .
i think i have a way to use their presence
to try to get through to her .
i &apos;m so sorry , i just can &apos;t ...
i just can &apos;t leave her yet .
i understand . take as much time as you need .
is that him ?
yes .
daddy .
hi , vi .
have a seat .
no , i want to be close to her .
not part of the deal .
then give us some privacy .
not part of the deal , either .
sit .
you got 5 minutes .
you &apos;re hurt .
don &apos;t worry about that . it &apos;s nothing .
i &apos;m really sorry .
about what ?
my sisters .
i had to tell them . please don &apos;t be mad . i had to .
now , listen , it &apos;s all right , vi .
ok ? it really is ok .
did you get the groceries yet ?
no , honey , i &apos;ve been here the whole time just like you .
but can we go now ?
i have some bad news .
we can &apos;t go there today .
we can &apos;t go there ever again .
but -- no -- we have to go to the store ,
and it &apos;s close by the disappearing place .
and we can be fast .
you &apos;re right , you &apos;re right , violet , but i can &apos;t .
these police , they don &apos;t think we should be together .
they &apos;re gonna break apart
our family just like i told you they would .
no .
i just wanted to come in and say goodbye
before they took me away .
wait , when will you be back ?
not for a very long time .
a very long time .
i would give you a hug goodbye ,
but they -- they won &apos;t let me .
no ! i -- please ...
please , can i just hug him ?
ok .
oh , violet , i &apos;m gonna miss you .
my beautiful violet .
my beautiful violet .
what is -- what is this ? who are these people ?
these are her parents .

but you said violet asked if thompson
had gotten the groceries yet ?
yeah , she said the store was right by the disappearing place .
well , we profiled he &apos;s a control freak .
he likes order , which means there &apos;s a good chance
he went to the same grocery store every time .
if we can figure out which one , we can narrow the search .
well , he would need the same kind of space ,
and he would want it close .
sir , yes , sir .

clients of michael clark thompson in the area .

bank accounts , invoices ...
