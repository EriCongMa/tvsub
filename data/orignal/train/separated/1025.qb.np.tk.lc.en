larssen was shipping nazi dinnerware .
are you offering to go to argentina ?
could be fun .
what is this ?
it &apos;s a fractal -- a mathematical curiosity .
it &apos;s a fractal antenna .
you &apos;re telling me that if we build a real one of these ...
it &apos;s gonna lead us to a boat or a plane
or something that disappeared in the 1940s .
i want to know the man who &apos;s pulling the trigger .
his name is vincent adler .
you knew him ?
he &apos;s the man who made me who i am today .
why are you helping us ?
i like having neal caffrey owe me one .
i owe you one .
something like that .
so as we all know , mr. stanzler is very , very specific .
the bordeaux glasses are only to be served with cabernet ,
and in burgundy glasses , for heaven &apos;s sake ,
only put pinot in these .
if it smells like paint the next time i walk in here ,
i will shoot someone .
mr. stanzler .
andrew , hi .
skip the pleasantries . you have six seconds .
okay , well , everything &apos;s set for saturday .
and what about the ice sculpture ?
uh , the 4x3 ice bear .
4x3 ? no. 8 feet .
8 feet ?
did i stutter ? 8 feet .
8 feet . i want it bold .
got it .
8 feet .
sorry about that .
no , it &apos;s okay .
one thing i like about your boss --
he knows what he wants .
yeah .
brooke ? are -- are you okay ?
last week , you said your husband works for the fbi .
yeah , he -- he does . is , uh -- is everything all right ?
no .
it &apos;s not .
new yorkers took to the streets
as temperatures soared to triple digits ,
making today one of the city &apos;s hottest days on record .
with east coast hydroelectric reporting record u &apos;ge ,
city authorities warn of more rolling blackouts ...
i know , satchmo .
you warned me not to use the central air
before the blackout hit .
but i didn &apos;t listen .
&apos;cause you &apos;re a dog .
so until we get it fixed , meet our new ac .
oh , it &apos;s a hot one . well , hello , my boys .
hello .
wow . look at the new air conditioner .
yeah . how &apos;s the world &apos;s most interesting evil man ?
actually , we need to talk about stanzler .
i told you andrew makes his money as an energy trader , right ?
uh ... yeah .
well , actually , it &apos;s worse than that .
i &apos;ve been working with his assistant , brooke ,
and she thinks stanzler &apos;s involved
in creating the blackouts .
say that again .
yeah . brooke overheard stanzler
talking about it with another trader .
so she did some digging .
she thinks they &apos;re withholding supply during peak hours
and then selling energy to the city for triple the rate .
el , these are very serious allegations .
honey , i know .
there are three confirmed deaths ,
and it &apos;s cost the city tens of millions .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m telling you .
all right . we have to bring her in to the bureau .
she doesn &apos;t want to come in .
she &apos;s terrified that someone &apos;s gonna see her
and tell stanzler .
do you know , he actually threatened
to shoot the painter today ?
seriously ?
oh , he was half @-@ joking .
but i wouldn &apos;t put it past him .
okay . so , where can i talk to brooke ?
well , maybe come down to the museum
while stanzler &apos;s out .
that &apos;s good .
you could bring neal .
why neal ?
well , honey , she &apos;s really nervous .
and , you know , neal has a calming smile .
fine . i &apos;ll bring neal and his calming smile .
thank you .
you &apos;re a good boy .
and so are you .
neal .
sara .
when did you get back in town ?
just a few days ago .
how was argentina ?
it was ... hot . but very interesting .
what did you find ?
i figured out where those crates we found
were being smuggled out of .
it &apos;s an estate in southern argentina .
love what they &apos;ve done with the place .
yeah , someone burned it down .
and i &apos;m pretty sure it was vincent adler .
i think this is where adler was hiding after he fled the u.s.
right . this is good .
yeah . i also met some locals .
and some llamas .
yes , and some llamas .
um , this is rosa . she worked in adler &apos;s kitchen .
said he was obsessed with finding
a german soldier named gerhard wagner .
who is he ?
i don &apos;t know , but hopefully the fbi can find out .
all right . i will pass this on to peter .
thank you .
it &apos;s good to see you .
you too .
yeah .
okay .
okay .
are you really going this way ?
yeah .
i hate that .
awkward goodbyes after you &apos;ve already said goodbye .
yeah .
i &apos;m gonna grab a coffee .
bye .
your husband will be here , right ?
he &apos;ll be here soon .
do you want to go over seating arrangements with yvonne ?
okay .
hey , thank god you &apos;re here .
where &apos;s my husband ? she &apos;s kind of losing it .
i &apos;m sure he &apos;s on his way . he said to meet him here .
um , will you call and see how close he is ?
yeah , of course .
okay .
i just got a text . andrew &apos;s coming . what do we do ?
i @-@ i thought he was in connecticut .
the meeting got canceled . so i @-@ i got to go .
h @-@ hold on just a second .
neal .
how far away are you ?
i had to borrow diana &apos;s car .
i would have been there in 10 , but there &apos;s an accident on 5th .
so now ... 17 minutes , plus 1 minute for parking ,
and i &apos;ll still be there 4 minutes early .
okay , hold on .
yeah , that might not be soon enough .
stanzler &apos;s on his way , too .
all right . do whatever you need to do to keep her calm .
but don &apos;t let her go .
you really miss your air conditioner , don &apos;t you ?
he made my dog pant .
now this is personal .
okay .
sorry . i know , i know . i trust you .
i just ...
i &apos;m sorry . i can &apos;t do this .
brooke argyle ?
yes .
hi . i &apos;m agent peter burke . how are you ?
hi .
hey , hon .
hey , honey . thanks for coming .
of course .
el told me you have information
that links andrew stanzler to the blackouts .
um , he &apos;s outside .
what your boss is doing is wrong ,
and it &apos;s hurting a lot of people .
will you help us ?
listen , you can trust my husband .
okay .
thank you .
we &apos;ll take care of you , okay ? el will be in touch .
yeah .
wow . did we really just do that ?
did you see any other option ?
no .
so , which one of us is gonna tell peter ?
i vote you .
thanks .
you &apos;re welcome .
you impersonated an agent .
you told me to do whatever i needed to do .
i didn &apos;t say commit a federal crime .
i convinced her to come in .
yeah . and now is the time to correct the situation
by having her meet the real peter burke .
she will blow out those doors so fast you won &apos;t see her shadow .
you know why ? &apos; cause the lights will be out
from the power outage she couldn &apos;t help us stop .
you do not get to be me anymore .
that doesn &apos;t go there .
what are you doing ? get up !
peter , she &apos;s skittish .
if i try to explain to her that i impersonated you ,
she &apos;ll never trust you , me , elizabeth , or the fbi .
no . don &apos;t touch that .
hello ?
oh , hey , el .
are you downstairs with brooke ?
great .
listen , i talked to neal ,
and we &apos;re just gonna be honest with her . yes .
that &apos;s all that --
honey , you --
right . uh @-@ huh . i understand .
okay . see you in a bit .
elizabeth talked you into it .
listen up , everybody .
for the next hour and only the next hour ,
you will call mr. caffrey special agent peter burke .
no questions . no laughing .
just do it .
and never speak of this again .
who ? me ?
what ? you don &apos;t even need him . what are you --
stay there .
hey , hon .
hi , hon .
great to see you .
hi , brooke .
hi .
hi .
i thought we were just gonna be speaking with your husband .
oh , we were , but , actually , this is , um ...
neal caffrey .
are you an agent , too ?
no . no . i wish i was .
i &apos;m just a consultant .
so , how does that work ?
actually , i &apos;m a criminal .
a criminal ?
i &apos;ve made a lot of really bad life choices ,
which landed me in prison .
but now i assist the fbi .
oh . okay . good .
as a matter of fact , had it not been
for agent burke here , i &apos;d still be in prison -- rotting .
you &apos;re giving me way more credit than i deserve .
no , no . don &apos;t be modest , peter .
you caught me -- twice .
and you can send me back any time you want .
why don &apos;t we go talk in my office ?
okay .
so , what role did stanzler &apos;s company play in all this ?
stanzler &apos;s company &apos;s a broker .
new york &apos;s electricity system is a deregulated market .
so if someone bought up enough energy ,
they could temporarily artificially create a shortage .
don &apos;t get any ideas , neal .
i won &apos;t . but i &apos;ll talk to the ...
you should talk to the commodities trading commission .
um , is there any way
you and i could speak -- just the two of us ?
i know neal seems intimidating ,
but he &apos;s very useful in cases like yours .
in fact , i think he &apos;s the single most valuable asset
we have here at the bureau .
please .
on second thought -- neal ...
cream . no sugar .
we have agents for that .
i have something better . i have you .
thank you .
i didn &apos;t want to say this
in front of your criminal consultant ,
but i think stanzler &apos;s looking for a burglar .
what &apos;s he trying to steal ?
i &apos;m not sure . but i was listening in
on a very cryptic phone conversation he had
with someone named bill rosko .
bill rosko .
i googled the name , and bill has a criminal record
for breaking ...
breaking and entering . yeah .
don &apos;t you hate it when peter makes you get coffee ?
you &apos;re getting me mocha chai latte &apos;s
for the rest of the month .
hey , boss .
why is neal in your office ?
neal is posing as peter so a witness will
tell us about an energy @-@ collusion scam .
awesome ! i &apos;m going in .
no .
come on . let me bring him a file .
what do you have ?
this is for peter .
diana ...
it &apos;s the info sara requested on gerhard wagner .
there &apos;s nothing in here .
why is gerhard wagner &apos;s file empty ?
the department of defense classified his information
when he immigrated to the u.s. after world war ii .
yeah , but that was more than 50 years ago .
i &apos;ll make some calls , see if i can get his file declassified .
all right .
i &apos;m gonna find out what brooke had to say to me .
this is gonna be good .
oh , yeah .
no , no , no .
a thief ?
sounds like a job for neal caffrey .
yeah , too bad stanzler &apos;s already made me .
i would love to find out what he was trying to steal --
you still can .
or the new neal caffrey can .
you &apos;re serious ?
peter , that &apos;s bold thinking ,
but posing as a thief -- particularly as me ...
i mean , we &apos;d be better off sending in
any number of competent criminal c.i. &apos; s .
no .
i &apos;m retaking control of this case
before anything else goes sideways .
talk to brooke . have her put neal caffrey , thief , on his books .
that &apos;s you ?
that &apos;s me .
welding is a lot harder than it looks .
i deserve a medal .
sorry about the flames .
you want to wear my extra helmet ?
i &apos;m good .
nothing like wearing a leather flame suit
on the hottest day of the year .
i &apos;m almost back to my fighting weight .
for the last parts for the antenna ,
i &apos;ve been scouring ebay europe .
are you even listening to me ?
you wouldn &apos;t believe the amount of paperwork required
to send someone undercover .
isn &apos;t that the suit &apos;s job ?
nah , he made me do it
since i told a whistle @-@ blower i was peter burke .
why would you do that ?
we were gonna lose her . i had to .
now i &apos;m stuck with the is9 form , a.k.a. ,
the whistle @-@ blower declaration of facts .
okay , remember when your mother said ,
&quot; don &apos;t cross your eyes &apos; cause they &apos;re gonna stay that way &quot; ?
yeah .
the same thing holds for impersonating a suit .
get out or i &apos;m gonna find you wearing wing tips .
what do you think ?
oh . i &apos;m too late .
the metamorphosis is complete , cockroach .
thanks , kafka .
peter .
sara .
what are you doing here ?
do i want to know ?
not yet .
all right .
&quot; tales of the fbi &apos;s classified files . &quot;
peter figured out why adler &apos;s so interested in wagner .
excellent . top @-@ secret movies . i &apos;ll make popcorn .
butter , please .
when do we get to the good part ?
shh ! quiet .
... in a relentless counterblockade
to destroy britain &apos;s shipping .
the man on the left is gerhard wagner .
worked as a radio operator in the u @-@ boat headquarters .
after the fall of the third reich , he fled to america .
he claimedo have top @-@ secret information
he wanted to share with the u.s.
gerhard wagner , however ,
was sent to a detention center at ellis island .
and whatever he knew disappeared with him
when he escaped from the detention center a few weeks later .
what kind of top @-@ secret information could wagner have
that adler would be looking for
a half @-@ century later ?
i have a feeling
it has something to do with the antenna mozzie &apos;s been building .
which makes sense , &apos; cause he was a radio guy .
if he escaped the detention center ,
he may have hopped the fence
and gotten in the naturalization line .
why not ? changed his name , became an upstanding citizen .
all right . we &apos;ll check the archives for matches
between his physical description and someone
who entered ellis island around that same time .
listen , uh ...
next time you &apos;re poking around classified files ,
see if you can find anything on the death of the electric car .
sure . and i can throw in some stuff about crop circles .
yes .
oh . you &apos;re joking .
mozzie , the u.s. government
is not conducting mind @-@ probe experiments .
that &apos;s what they &apos;ve made you believe .
are we doing this again ?
guess so . you headed home ?
no , i &apos;m gonna go grab a bite . how about you ?
oh , just to the gym . - really ? i just -- i took you
for more of a &quot; sit @-@ up / push @-@ up in the morning &quot; kind of guy .
i swim .
yeah ?
how &apos;s that work with your ankle bracelet ?
it &apos;s waterproof .
are you trained in counter @-@ surveillance ?
you talking about the guy at our 6 : 00 ?
so the answer &apos;s yes .
yes .
and he knows we made him .
how long do you want to stay here ?
we &apos;ll see what his next move is .
much better .
that &apos;s not fair . it &apos;s my game .
ah , we take turns .
he &apos;s making his next move .
you okay ?
yeah .
yeah , i &apos;ve been followed before in my line of work .
whoever he is ...
he knows you &apos;re working for us .
so the emergency exits are here ...
and here .
there &apos;s only one entrance to the exhibit
and a service corridor .
if you &apos;re not planning on robbing the museum ,
why would you need to know all this ?
it &apos;s my &apos; in &apos; -- to impress stanzler .
you know , it &apos;s sexy watching you plan a heist .
yeah ? think i should go rogue ?
yes .
all right . say goodbye to peter burke .
hi . i &apos;m caffrey .
neal caffrey .
what ?
nothing .
you don &apos;t like my neal ?
well , he sort of has a way of ,
i don &apos;t know , pulling you in when he talks --
a kind of quiet , sexy whisper .
oh , sexy , huh ?
and he doesn &apos;t put his hands on his hips .
right .
he gets people to do what he wants by charming them .
he doesn &apos;t rely on a badge .
really ?
well , you are so smart .
you have all the answers ,
and i couldn &apos;t do this without you .
much better .
oh , honey ?
you &apos;re gonna have to take off your wedding ring .
i am .
feel naked without it .
hmm . maybe you could wear a hat .
mr. stanzler ...
this is neal caffrey .
who ?
11 : 00 , sir .
i understand you &apos;re interested in an acquisition .
i &apos;m sorry ? what ?
you &apos;re interested in an acquisition .
who told you that ?
big bill rosko . he said you offered him a job .
yeah , well , big bill has a big mouth .
and i never offered him anything .
hmm . well , if there is a job , i &apos;m your man .
yeah .
everybody in your business says the same thing , right ?
what if i told you i could rob this place
in under 20 minutes ?
i &apos;d say good luck .
we &apos;ve got the top @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line security system .
it &apos;s good , but nothing &apos;s perfect .
two cameras cover the front and back ,
but they &apos;re blind to the side exits .
your roof ? it &apos;s a burglar &apos;s dream .
1 @-@ inch wood and asphalt .
what exactly would you leave with ?
every display is laser @-@ guarded ,
heat- , motion- , and weight @-@ sensored .
i know .
so i &apos;d skip the display and hit your private collection .
how did you know about that ?
like i said . i &apos;m the best .
stanzler needs a thief to steal a flash drive from this man --
another trader , francis luntz .
slow down , caffrey .
i want to hear details about &quot; the meet . &quot;
quiet , you .
based on their trading records
and what little information i got from stanzler ,
i believe the two are using their combined market power
to create temporary shortages .
but did you flaunt your past crimes ?
no , i did not flaunt my past crimes .
how did you convince him to hire you ?
i &apos;m that good .
these guys are incredibly careful .
from what i can gather , luntz doesn &apos;t trust stanzler .
he secretly videotaped one of their meetings .
now , this video , which is now on flash drive ,
is what stanzler wants me to retrieve .
steal .
steal .
why don &apos;t we just use a warrant ?
we could ,
but stanzler doesn &apos;t know exactly what &apos;s on the tape .
so if we shake luntz down and the video is insufficient ,
we blow our chances of catching either one of these guys .
but i do want a warrant for luntz &apos;s home .
i don &apos;t need a warrant to break in .
well , this neal caffrey does . that &apos;s it for now .
after we left my apartment last night ,
sara and i were followed .
any suspects ?
adler . i think he put a tail on sara .
everyone who &apos;s looked into him -- mozzie , kate --
they all got hurt .
where is she now ?
at the archives . i &apos;m meeting her there .
good idea . stay close to her .
all right , but for my break @-@ in , i &apos;m gonna need some training .
i got you covered .
ah . my pupil has arrived .
take the pebble from my palm .
seriously ? kung fu ?
i &apos;m preparing you for your mission .
okay . give me $ 20 .
look , do you want my help or not ?
lesson 1 -- we take .
we don &apos;t give .
now , moving on --
give me my 20 back , or i &apos;m gonna arrest you .
oh , you &apos;re gonna be a very difficult student .
anyone follow you ?
no . you ?
all clear .
they said over the phone that it could take
up to four weeks for us to get access to those files .
that &apos;s all right . i got a plan .
are you gonna share that plan with me ?
any chance you can tell me
a little more about what you &apos;re looking for ?
only that it &apos;s regarding an individual
who may have come through ellis island in 1946 .
we need to look through files to match a physical description .
the rest is national security .
you understand .
of course . sorry i wasn &apos;t more helpful over the phone .
she didn &apos;t say she was with the fbi .
oh , she &apos;s not .
i am .
please , follow me .
peter knows . the broad strokes .
this is it .
records . ledgers . card catalogs .
which ones are from 1946 ?
all of them . excuse me .
yeah , we can do this .
okay , listen up , sausage fingers .
we don &apos;t have all day .
oh , our guest speaker .
hello , there . how &apos;s he doing ?
we &apos;ll come back to the lock @-@ picking later .
byron would be so thrilled to know
his training jacket
is back in the game .
are you teaching him to run a cross ?
scratch on a dip .
with the farmer &apos;s pants ?
neal wants to run a bird dog .
oh . he &apos;s a fed .
can we move on with this ?
uh , yes .
now , your first task
is to drop a bug into stanzler &apos;s jacket
so your little evil empire friends in the van
can listen in on him ,
while you fumble through the house .
do we need a commentary ?
yes .
but dropping the bug isn &apos;t the hard part .
retrieving it is -- without jingling the bells .
oh . again .
all right .
this is impossible .
understatement is the key .
these two fingers , like tweezers --
so that the thumb will never touch the mark .
it &apos;s gonna take a while .
so tell me , repo ...
... why you helping out ?
what &apos;s your angle in all this ?
if adler spent his life searching for something ,
that means the payoff &apos;s got to be bigger
than the billion he &apos;s already stolen .
that &apos;s all ?
i like the mystery .
i know what it &apos;s like to have a lot of questions .
really ?
when i was 13 , my older sister ran away
and we never heard from her again .
i &apos;m sorry .
i used to go into her room and just look at her things
and hope that something held the key .
you know , if there was a book about dancers ,
i &apos;d wonder , &quot; is she a ballerina ? &quot;
or -- there was a pony poster .
so i wondered if she was off on a ranch somewhere .
and i never found the answers i was looking for .
but ...
if we find adler ,
maybe you can have some closure with kate .
last chance , suit . some of us go to work at night .
like this ?
you didn &apos;t drop the bug .
no , i didn &apos;t .
i decided to practice one more lift .
you &apos;ve learned all i have to teach you .
you , peter burke , are ready to commit a crime .
good luck .
thanks
looking sharp , peter .
thank you .
there &apos;s a very good teacher inside that little shiny head of his .
how &apos;d it go at the archives ?
great . but it &apos;s gonna take a while to find wagner .
another late night with sara , huh ?
hey , keep your eye on the prize , okay ?
this is serious . stanzler doesn &apos;t mess around .
now , remember , backup is 10 seconds away --
you don &apos;t give me the &quot; be careful &quot; speech .
i invented the &quot; be careful &quot; speech .
yeah , but since i &apos;m you , i should give ...
you &apos;re neal in the van , and i &apos;m neal outside the van .
okay .
then go out there and make me look good .
neal .
mr. stanzler .
when you get to that master bedroom ,
look for anything called &quot; project edison . &quot;
got it .
my meeting with luntz will last 20 minutes .
you have exactly that to find the video
and find your way back to the bentley .
20 minutes ? plenty of time .
it better be . otherwise , you &apos;re on your own .
let &apos;s go .
heads up , guys .
i think we &apos;re pulling in to luntz &apos; mansion .
out of the vehicle . headed for the basement door .
good . we got ears on you .
wait for me to confirm that .
working on the lock now .
okay , we have ears on you .
i &apos;m in .
so , tell me about this guy , wheelock ,
your contact at the power company .
what else did he say ?
they have budget cuts , fewer controls ,
which makes monitoring us that much more difficult .
3,000 immigrants a week ,
and not one of these files is computerized .
well , whoever this gerhard wagner is ,
he has earned my admiration .
how &apos;s that ?
he worked the system to his advantage .
i mean , one day he was here , and the next -- poof --
he &apos;s vanished into the vast bureaucracy --
like a german dave chappelle .
did neal send you to come sit with me ?
uh ... no one sends me . i go places .
of course . my mistake .
he &apos;s not worried about you , if that &apos;s what you &apos;re implying .
i &apos;m here for obvious reasons .
well , of course .
i mean , it &apos;s impossible to deny
this tracy / hepburn thing between us .
i do want you , mozzie .
please . control yourself .
i &apos;m here to double the workforce .
i want to get adler , too .
oh . i take that as a sign .
of what ?
i &apos;ll let you know .
i &apos;m in the master bedroom .
all right . check the drawers and cabinets .
people usually hide things where they &apos;re easily accessible .
as mozzie taught you .
i found a safe key . &quot; centurion . &quot;
centurion . look for an in @-@ wall safe .
mrs. luntz .
well done , mr. luntz .
i found the safe .
i found the video .
copying it now . i &apos;ll give the original to stanzler
and keep the backup for us .
guys , listen to this .
this chip wheelock , the guy at e.c.h. --
that &apos;s east coast hydroelectric .
what exactly does he know ?
he knows he wants in .
we got a guy in the power company ,
flips a switch , rolling blackouts .
we make a fortune .
no . no way . it &apos;s too risky .
you mean it &apos;s too easy ?
look , go to the party on saturday night .
talk to the guy , spend a few minutes ,
see what he has to say .
if you don &apos;t like it , take a walk .
peter , stanzler and luntz may have an executive
from east coast hydroelectric in their pocket .
he &apos;s meeting them at the party on saturday .
all right .
we wait until saturday and take down all three of them .
video &apos;s copied .
i &apos;m on my way out .
what &apos;s your exit plan ?
same as my entrance plan .
did you get it ?
yeah .
very good .
give me a hand .
it &apos;s been a pleasure .
want another job ?
what do you have in mind ?
geller museum . saturday . 5 : 00 .
tell no one . ask no questions . i &apos;ll pay you double .
okay .
okay .
after the first outage , we were clear seven figures
i &apos;m not committing to anything today .
this is what was on the drive .
luntz recorded this meeting and kept his mouth shut ,
even though , we believe , he went on to participate .
on saturday , stanzler &apos;s trying to bring in
this man to sweeten the pot .
chip wheelock , senior manager at east coast hydroelectric .
with someone at the power plant able to flip the switch ,
they &apos;ll be able to escalate their plan .
that means more blackouts .
not if we stop them .
i &apos;ve been invited to an event as neal ,
so we can take advantage of this opportunity
by slipping a video feed on stanzler .
how are we gonna do that ?
brooke was able to get
stanzler &apos;s suit from the dry cleaner .
we installed a camera in place of the lapel button .
check this out .
nice .
brooke will make sure that stanzler &apos;s wearing that jacket .
jones , diana , you &apos;ll be in the van .
always .
i like the van .
and , as a precaution , i &apos;ll be accompanying elizabeth ...
... as my wife &apos;s husband .
tell your staff they get $ 100 each if they don &apos;t spill anything .
they get fired if they do .
el said you knew how to motivate your employees .
that &apos;s the smallest 8 @-@ foot bear i &apos;ve ever seen in my life .
i &apos;ve got stanzler &apos;s camera online .
anything stanzler sees , we &apos;ll see .
neal , have you met peter and elizabeth burke ?
hi . nice to meet you .
nice to meet you .
this is my lovely wife , elizabeth .
you married up .
telling me .
i could use a drink right now .
yes , i &apos;ll have one , too .
yeah , me too . thank you .
mr. stanzler , mr. luntz is here .
want to help me out here for a second ?
yeah , you &apos;re the boss .
ladies having fun ?
so this is undercover work , huh ?
i &apos;m sure peter &apos;s hating every second of it .
and you ? how does it feel to be an fbi agent ?
still trying it on .
excuse us , ladies .
what are we doing ? your assignment .
everyone hear that ?
showtime .
copy that , peter .
you donated all this ?
yeah . i &apos;d like you to babysit .
my friend francis there is not having a very good day .
that &apos;s my assignment ? babysit luntz ?
yeah . i &apos;ll have more for you when i get back .
a lot on your mind ?
yeah .
listen , i &apos;m glad that ,
uh , stanzler let us atone for a couple minutes .
i don &apos;t know what he told you , but i &apos;m not interested .
i mean , this thing --
it &apos;s gotten way beyond what i ever imagined .
you two -- you do what you want ...
but i &apos;m out .
sorry , wheelock .
wait . yeah , wait . francis ...
he told you i was chip wheelock ?
yeah .
are you not ?
excuse me a minute .
i know about your energy scheme with stanzler .
you what ?
he &apos;s planning to double @-@ cross you .
he -- he can &apos;t do that . i have leverage over him .
actually , you don &apos;t .
stanzler had me break into your estate and steal the video .
who the hell are you ?
jones , we &apos;re locked in the stanzler gallery .
on it .
yeah , this is jones .
you sure ?
guys , another blackout &apos;s about to sweep through this sector .
diana , find elizabeth .
elizabeth . backup generator ?
uh , downstairs . let &apos;s get down there .
okay . okay .
where &apos;s the team ?
on their way in .
who you talking to ?
the fbi .
of course . perfect .
stanzler told you that wheelock would be here
to lure you out .
why ?
my guess ? when the power goes out ,
he can circumvent the security cameras
and come back here unnoticed .
what &apos;s the point ?
oh , geez .
he &apos;s gonna kill me .
if i &apos;m right , he &apos;s gonna try to kill us both .
who &apos;s got eyes on stanzler ?
all right . i see him . he &apos;s on the far side of the room .
i &apos;m on him .
ladies and gentlemen ,
due to the blackout , this museum is now in lockdown .
fbi ! everyone stay where you are !
remain calm !
oh , come on .
can you open this ?
peter , stanzler &apos;s making his move .
he &apos;s out of the atrium , but i can &apos;t tell his location .
peter &apos;s in the stanzler gallery .
we need to get a key . let &apos;s go .
yes , sir .
hurry up . hold this .
i wasn &apos;t trained to do this in the dark .
peter , there &apos;s another light in that room .
it &apos;s stanzler . he &apos;s got a gun .
we &apos;re at the generator . it &apos;s been disengaged .
can you turn it on ?
fbi ! drop it ! you &apos;re surrounded , stanzler .
like he said ...
fbi has you surrounded .
i didn &apos;t know you had moves like that .
i didn &apos;t know i authorized a badge .
well , i needed one . i was an fbi agent .
was .
was .
you enjoyed being me .
i admit there &apos;s a certain ... allure to your profession .
how about you ?
being neal caffrey has its charms .
ignoring convention ? embracing your id ? yeah .
and i do look good in black .
you do .
i have a feeling i had to work a lot harder
fitting into your world than you did fitting into mine .
i don &apos;t know about that .
good work .
got the generator back on .
i couldn &apos;t leave you in the dark .
oh . welcome home , agent burke .
it &apos;s good to be home , mrs . burke .
thank you .
i was starving .
mozzie &apos;s in the other room looking at microfiche .
how was your night ?
oh , the usual .
yeah ? what &apos;d you get me ?
oh , i love gourmet finger food .
is that --
guess the blackout finally caught up to this grid .
m @-@ mozzie gave me a lantern . let me get out of your way here .
sorry .
heilige scheisse .
i &apos;m sorry .
don &apos;t be sorry .
uh , sara ...
