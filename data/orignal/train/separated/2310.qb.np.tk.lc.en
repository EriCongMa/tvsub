for over a century , i have lived in secret until now .
i know the risk but i have to know her .
how could you not sparkle ?
because i live in the real world
where vampire &apos;s burning in the sun .
but you go in the sun .
i have a ring . it protects me .
the pocket watch . where is it ?
it is supposed to be mine .
did you get the gilbert &apos;s watch ?
i can get it .
good . we are gonna need it .
what is that ?
very important crystal .
you &apos;re the mystery guy , and i like that .
but when mystery becomes secret .
i just need you to trust me .
trust is earned .
oh my god , caroline , what happened ?
nothing .
did damon hurt you ?
there are bruises all over caroline .
i &apos;m handling it .
the vervain could weaken him if he ingested it .
it would help you get the upper hand .
i knew i couldn &apos;t spike your drink ,
so i spiked hers .
five bodies are all drained off blood .
they &apos;ve come back .
where &apos;s my ring ?
you won &apos;t be needing it anymore .
how long have i been here ?
three days .
what are you doing ?
during the dark ages , when the vampire &apos;s actions start to expose
and bring harms upon the entire race .
they will face judgement . they sort to re @-@ educate them
rather than to punish them .
you know what happened if i don &apos;t feed on blood .
you &apos;ll go weaker and weaker .
and eventually won &apos;t be able to move or speak .
in a week , your skin will desiccate and you will munmmify ,
and live in coffins .
unable to hurt anyone , ever .
so you are going to keep me in the basement forever .
i will ingest you and the vervain will keep you in weak
once the interrogation starts i will move you to the family cript .
and then in 50 years we can re @-@ evaluate .
i &apos;m stronger than you think .
you always have been .
but you are not stronger than the vervain .
and we both know it .
i &apos;m sorry .
then , it has to be this way .
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m almost done .
it &apos;s ok . take your time .
i think you might be in trouble .
what did you do ?
elena saw me .
i &apos;m a drug useing delinquent .
girls in bed doesn &apos;t really rank , sorry .
are you aware what is going on upstaires ?
and you have no objections .
it could be crafty you know about it ,
at least he made an effort to sneak in and out .
oh and , just so you know , i won &apos;t be home for the dinner .
so you are actually going to do it .
you &apos;re going to go out with logan .
i &apos;m gonna show up and torturer him . yes .
and have you heard from stefan ?
not since he left that very vague message three days ago .
hey , elena , urh ,
i have something i have to do ,
i &apos;ll explain it in a few days .
have you called him ?
nope , not going to either .
and you are ok with everything ?
no , i &apos;m not ok with any of them .
i &apos;m not gonna cry about it either .
i was gonna write my diary this morning and then i thought
what i &apos;m gonna write ?
honestly , i &apos;m not gonna be one of those pathetic girls
whose world stops being because of some guy .
ok , then .
i &apos;ll be fine .
is he weak ?
he &apos;s weak , but it &apos;s better seal him in the basement .
he &apos;s damon , he &apos;s very dangeous and he still might be .
you &apos;re going to school ?
i came here to live a life , it &apos;s about time i get back to that .
and elena , if she is still speaking to me .
why haven &apos;t you called her ?
what am i supposed to do ? fake another lie ?
i hate lying to her , zach , i &apos;m not good at it .
she &apos;s already thought i &apos;m hiding something .
what choice do you have ?
you came back ,
because you want to live as normal life as you could .
you know this could be a part of it .
i remember the party .
damon came behind me and
he was kissing my neck
or he &apos;s biting my neck ?
i passed out .
it &apos;s like there &apos;s holes in my memory lately .
it &apos;s just weird . maybe i let him bite me .
why would you do that ?
can we just not talk about it ?
okay ? i just don &apos;t want to talk about damon .
and i don &apos;t wannna talk about any of it .
i just want to go back to normal .
what are you doing with that candle ?
nothing .
what &apos;s this ?
damon gives it to me .
or he was going to give it to me ,
alll i know is it &apos;s mine now .
it &apos;s ugly .
get your rubby hand out of it .
the sexy subs car wash is a smile .
the football team and the band of the committed
well , not all the band ,
just the one you can pull off the bikini .
i want in your face , sexy ,
i mean it &apos;s a fundraiser , for god &apos;s sake .
unbelievable , it is like nothing had happened .
she doesn &apos;t denial .
you know , i gonna go .
be somewhere right now .
i &apos;m so sorry i haven &apos;t called .
no worries . i wll live .
i was dealing with damon .
and did you ?
deal with damon ?
yes , yeah .
for four days ?
you have every right be upset with me , but
can i explain it all to you , please ?
sure . when ?
i gonna be home after school , but
the grill ? at 4 o &apos;clock ?
ok .
thanks .
stefan . where is damon ?
he has some serious apologize to do .
he &apos;s gone , caroline .
when is he coming back ?
he is not coming back .
i &apos;m sorry .
this is a good thing , caroline .
i know that .
hey , matt .
have you seen stefan ?
no .
if you wanna kill some time , we can rack .
come on . we haven &apos;t play for ...
i will let you break .
i am full of vervain .
i &apos;ve been putting it in my coffee for 16 years .
my blood will only make you worse .
damon ?
so it was your vervain . good for you .
good for you .
family only runs so deep .
we &apos;re not family , damon .
only in the most dysfunctional sense .
in fact , i avoided having a living , breathing ,
loving family because of you .
i don &apos;t guess i could talk you into
bringing me a rabbit or something ?
i &apos;d settle for stefan &apos;s diet at this point .
you know i can &apos;t do that .
you succeeded , zach .
i &apos;m shutting down .
you &apos;re like your grandfather .
he didn &apos;t like it when i came to visit , either .
but you don &apos;t visit , damon .
you appear , unannounced ,
reminding me that this isn &apos;t my house ;
that you &apos;re just permitting me to live here .
hell , that you &apos;re permitting me to live .
someone had to mow the lawn .
i came to say good @-@ bye , damon .
unlock it .
unlock the door , zach .
keep it up , damon .
the more energy you expend ,
the faster you &apos;ll go .
and there &apos;s vicki , all nonchalant in the bathroom ,
like it &apos;s no big deal that they &apos;re hooking up .
yeah , i &apos;m not gonna lie .
your brother and my sister , that &apos;s weird .
yeah .
how late is he ?
hitting the hour mark .
hope there &apos;s nothing wrong .
which means i &apos;m not talking boy problems with you .
good .
i mean , it &apos;s not like we were ever best friends or anything .
ok .
here goes--
what do you think of stefan ?
is he a good guy ?
why ? what &apos;s he done ?
not any one thing .
he &apos;s just so secretive all the time .
i think there &apos;s something that he doesn &apos;t want me to know ,
which makes me want to know all the more .
like what ? like that he &apos;s a serial killer
and he keeps a clown suit in his trunk ?
no , of course not .
but what do we know about him , really ?
he &apos;s great at football .
a little bit of a loner .
and as much as i hate saying it ,
he might be a nice guy .
so you think i &apos;m just being paranoid ?
i think you should talk to him .
talk to who ?
i &apos;m so sorry that i &apos;m late .
what happened ?
i got held up .
is everything ok ?
there was this thing with my uncle .
and you couldn &apos;t call
and tell me that you were going to be an hour late ?
ok . you two have fun .
i &apos;m really sorry .
it was unavoidable .
what was unavoidable ?
ok .
oh , uh , elena , please ...
no , stefan , don &apos;t you get it ?
every question gets a vague non @-@ answer .
what is so awful that you &apos;re afraid to tell me ?
i know you .
my god .
i &apos;m sorry ?
i know you . how can it be ?
i think you have the wrong person , sir .
you haven &apos;t aged a day .
i &apos;m sorry . excuse me .
hey , can we-- can i take you home ?
and we can talk about it ? is that ok ?
wait , what was that ?
i--i don &apos;t know . uh , nothing .
right , nothing . ok , um ... i gotta go , stefan .
excuse me .
i tried . i want so much to make things right ,
but every instinct in my body is telling me to be careful
what you don &apos;t know can hurt you .
evening , sheriff .
anything ?
we went over the entire west side of the lake .
all the caverns by the falls were clean , no signs of habitat .
well , they &apos;re staying in town .
we canvassed all abandoned buildings and warehouses .
there has to be a private residence .
and that much harder to locate , if not impossible .
these creatures are smart . they know how to go undetected .
well , someone who only comes out at night
should eventually become obvious .
what about the watch ?
i &apos;m working on it .
i knew the gilberts .
that watch is passed down to the men in the family .
i &apos;d start with jeremy .
i can &apos;t believe you really came .
you have an hour . make it count .
you ok ?
is vicki in there ?
don &apos;t answer a question with another question .
maybe . what &apos;s wrong with you ?
i &apos;m miserable .
well , you should go get something to eat .
jenna ?
jenna ?
stefan ? what are you doing here ?
dinner .
jeremy told me that chicken parmesan is one of your favorites ,
and i happen to be a good cook . the italian roots demand it .
i can even make my own homemade mozzarella .
only tonight , it is unfortunately storboboht . sorry .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re trying to accomplish .
you want to know me , right ?
well , i figure if you &apos;re going to dump me ,
you should at least , um , know who you &apos;re dumping .
so let &apos;s start with katherine .
stefan ...
she was ... the most beautiful girl that i had ever met .
she had this perfect olive skin .
and she had this laugh . it was ridiculous .
i mean , her laugh made you laugh . and she was fun .
she knew how to have a good time .
but katherine was also very impatient and entitled
and selfish , and , um , and impulsive .
enter damon .
he claims that he was with her first.i don &apos;t know .
i do know that i did some things that ... i &apos;m not proud of .
and my biggest regret ...
is not being able to make it right before she died .
i miss her , but ... i &apos;m no longer crippled by her loss .
it was very nice what you did for stefan .
very romantic .
well , i was feeling romantic .
look what i found .
&quot; elena gilbert ,
&quot; take one tablet every 4 to 6 hours , as needed for pain . &quot;
those are left over from the car accident .
so she won &apos;t miss them .
no , not with that . that &apos;s an antique .
i feel like we &apos;re always getting high .
that &apos;s the beauty of choice .
well , then let &apos;s choose not to .
i mean , we don &apos;t have to be high all the time , right ?
i really hope you &apos;re not one of those guys
who , now that we &apos;re together , tries to change everything about me .
no .
good .
i &apos;m an avid reader , a huge fitzgerald fan ,
the great gatsby , his masterpiece .
but i &apos;m no snob .
i love some good grisham .
i think seinfeld is the best american television show
for the past 50 years ,
but i love lucy is all @-@ time .
&quot; the loving cup &quot; episode was the best , i think .
huge scorsese fan .
i can watch taxi driver over and over again .
here , let me .
as far as music , it &apos;s pretty much across the board .
um , dylan , hendrix , patsy , willie .
oh , kanye . you know what , i even like that one miley song .
easy .
i didn &apos;t say anything .
hey , this is for the garlic bread , right ?
because i &apos;m not eating garlic
unless you agree to , too .
are you kidding ? i love garlic .
you ok ? um ...
yeah . think so .
your face ...
i--i , uh ,
i think i got something in my eye .
stefan .
stefan !
um , i think that my paranoia
has turned into full @-@ blown hallucinations .
part of your charm .
caroline .
caroline .
no , tiki , do not do the one @-@ piece , ok ?
i &apos;ve seen it on you . trust me .
yeah , but you &apos;re going for stripper pole vibe this year .
caroline .
yeah , maybe we should wash the cars in slow motion .
no .
caroline .
what ? oh , um , no , sorry .
um , so i &apos;ll just see you tomorrow .
two @-@ piece . ok , bye .
god !
i bet you &apos;re feeling pretty good about yourself , aren &apos;t you ?
not particularly .
you won .
you got the bad guy .
now nothing could come between you and elena .
except the truth .
the lies will catch up to you , stefan .
as long as you keep lying to yourself about what you are .
the beauty of you in there and me out here ...
is that i can walk away .
no friend discounts .
no freebies .
no pay ya laters .
we are not running a charity here .
no , we are not .
the event is called sexy suds , you know .
did we just get scolded ?
and judged , yeah .
i &apos;m sorry ,
but i guess you &apos;re going to have to take that off .
i think you have to go first .
ok .
ok , um--sorry ,
so not sexy .
i disagree .
uh @-@ uh , no .
none of that tortured pining stuff .
i &apos;m just observing .
tiki . this one &apos;s yours .
why do i always get the homely os ?
just to be clear , your car &apos;s a p.o.s.
i mean , we can wash it , but it &apos;s still a p.o.s.
you don &apos;t have to be rude .
rude is uglying up the road with that junk .
wet and wild , tik .
all proceeds are going to the school &apos;s athletic department
still healing from the tragic death
of their football coach william tanner .
the citizens of mystic falls
coming together in support of one of their own .
cut it .
classy .
thank you .
but you &apos;re still going to
video the girls in bikinis , right ?
we , 53 % of americans watch the news with the sound off .
thank you for dinner .
i had a nice time .
do you remember the last time
we were in the school parking lot ?
nope .
doesn &apos;t ring a bell .
really ?
nada .
especially not having sex in the minivan .
that was a good day .
what ?
you &apos;re getting soap in that .
oh , it &apos;s fine .
i noticed at damon has one , too .
is there a story behind it ?
yeah , it &apos;s the family crest from the italian renaissance .
what &apos;s the stone ?
it &apos;s called lapus lazuli .
you should really take it off .
i could put it in my bag .
no , it &apos;s-- it &apos;s fine , really .
thanks , though .
ok .
i &apos;m gonna get some towels .
ok .
hey , we &apos;re out of towels and those shimmy things .
i &apos;ll go get some more . mind the money .
caroline .
caroline , help me .
caroline .
help me .
help me .
that &apos;ll be $ 20 .
i saw you last night .
you were talking to a friend of mine ,
at the grill ?
well , i--i thought it was somebody i knew .
stefan salvatore .
nah , it can &apos;t be .
it &apos;s just my mind playing tricks on me .
where do you think you &apos;d seen him before ?
when i first moved here ,
i stayed at the salvatore boarding house .
stefan was just passing through to visit his uncle .
i mean , none of us knew he was even here
until the attack .
the attack ?
his uncle got killed .
mauled by an animal in the woods .
his uncle , zach ?
mm @-@ mmm . joseph .
i &apos;m sorry , sir .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;m familiar with the story .
oh , how could you ?
i mean , this happened years ago .
grandpa , you gotta go . mom wants you home .
ok ?
ah .
he wasn &apos;t bugging you , was he ?
he &apos;s a little alzy @-@ heimer .
no , he was sweet .
hey , sir ,
i &apos;m sorry . um , are you sure
that the man that you saw ,
that you knew , his name was stefan salvatore ?
yes .
i remember his ring and his brother--
damon ?
yeah .
stefan and damon salvatore .
when was this ?
it was early june ,
1953 .
yeah .
june , 1953 .
caroline finally freed you , huh ?
uh , i don &apos;t know where she went .
she abandoned me .
hey , i realized earlier , i had no idea
that your family was from italy .
no ?
last name salvatore didn &apos;t do it for you ?
right .
duh .
are there any other salvatores in mystic falls ?
my uncle zach .
where did everyone else go ?
kinda just spread out .
why ?
i &apos;m just trying to learn more about you .
where are you taking me ?
we can &apos;t hide out in your room all the time .
welcome to my other favorite party place .
what , the cemetary ?
yeah . it &apos;s cool , huh ?
yo , vick !

you baby @-@ sitting , donovan ?
this is jeremy . he &apos;s cool .

your car was done an hour ago .
you &apos;re saying that out loud why ?
hi . elena , right ?
i think i met you once when you were 9 .
your emotional maturity level when we were together .
ouch . here i thought we were making progress .
is he enough in your good graces
that i can ask him for a favor ?
if i do her a favor ,
will i get back in your good graces ?
uh , a very reluctant maybe to both .
done . wait . one condition .
dinner , tonight , your house .
fine . but you &apos;re eating leftovers .
what do you need ?
do you have access to old news stories ,
say , fifties ?
yeah , at the station .
between the archives and the internet ,
we pretty much have everything .
i have this report way past due .
it &apos;d be a life saver .
heading there now .
let &apos;s go .
if anyone asks , you don &apos;t know where i went .
i don &apos;t want caroline to know that i left .
caroline , help me .
help me .
caroline .
damon ?
damon ?
damon ?
oh , my god !
what is this ?
how did i know that you were here ?
because i wanted you to .
very , very badly .
let me out of here .
please .
you bit me .
you liked it .
remember ?
why do i keep remembering the same things ,
but in different ways ?
you remember what i want you to remember .
and now that the vervain has passed out of your system ,
you won &apos;t remember what you &apos;re about to do .
what am i about to do ?
you &apos;re gonna open the door .
you &apos;re gonna open the door .
no ! no !
get out of here .
run !
run !
sweeper duty .

we have to clean the pavement .
it &apos;s a car wash .
by definition , the pavement &apos;s clean .
but not dry .
and i &apos;m doing this why ?
caroline bailed , so that leave me in charge .
fabulous .
bonnie !
bonnie !
bonnie !
what just happened ?
you were in some kind of a trance .
did i do this ?
i think so , yes .
nobody else saw , did they ?
don &apos;t tell anybody .
please .
we digitized all our archives last year .
you can pull all the remote footage right up on screen .
what is it exactly you &apos;re looking for ?
an incident from 1953,
if it even happened--
at the old salvatore boarding house .
sorry , one second .
yeah ?
fire ?
all right , i &apos;ll be right there .
i gotta go .
you believe there &apos;s actual news to cover in this town ?
all right , use keywords to search the database .
it &apos;s pretty easy to navigate .
and brady down in tech will help you out with anything you need .
could you put in a good word for me with jenna ?
you got it .
all right . good luck .
what ?
i &apos;m stoned in a cemetery .
they don &apos;t mind , they &apos;re dead .
you know what ? i gotta take this up a notch .
hey , tony .
nice .
vickies from vicki .
well , thank you , elena gilbert ,
whoever you are .
you took those from the house ?
she wasn &apos;t using it .
she &apos;s gonna notice if they &apos;re gone . that &apos;s not cool .
it &apos;s no big deal , jer .
yeah , it kinda is , vick .
damn , dude .
vicki brought the party police .
shut up , tony .
i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t mean to make you mad .
well , what are we doing , partying in a cemetery
with a bunch of losers ?
those are my friends .
they &apos;re waste of space small @-@ town lifers .
yeah ? what am i ?
you &apos;re different , vick .
no , you are .
you &apos;re the kid with the big house
who &apos;s acting out because his parents died .
guess what-- you &apos;ll get over it .
you will pull yourself together , move on ,
and one day tell your kids stories
about your dark period growing up .
and i &apos;ll still be here , waiting tables at the grill ,
partying at the cemetery
with a bunch of waste of space small @-@ town lifers .
look-- go home , jeremy .
if i want to feel like crap about myself ,
i &apos;ll just go back to tyler .
hey , have you seen elena ?
no , not for a while .
you think she went home ?
not sure .
thanks .
hey .
i &apos;m not saying this for you .
i &apos;m saying it for her .
but she &apos;s big on trust .
so whatever you &apos;re holding back from her ,
the more you try to hide it ,
the more she won &apos;t stop till she figures it out .
this is michael fell
reporting to you from the salvatore boarding house ,
where a brutal animal attack has ended in tragedy .
ok , they &apos;re bringing out the bodies .
see if you can get closer .
is that the nephew ?
i didn &apos;t see you at the car wash .
left early .
honey , are you ok
anything you want to talk about ?
is it a boy thing ?
mom , if i want to talk boys , i &apos;ll call dad .
at least he &apos;s successfully dating one .
dear diary ,
i &apos;m not a believer .
people are born , they grow old ,
and then they die .
that &apos;s the world we live in .
there &apos;s no magic , no mysticism ,
no immortality .
there &apos;s nothing that defies rational thought .
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s happening to me .
i know , dear .
logan ?
logan ?
people are supposed to be who they say they are .
and not lie or hide their true selves .
what are you doing here ?
oh , hey , man . just looking for the bathroom .
it &apos;s not possible .
i &apos;m not a believer , i can &apos;t be .
but how can i deny what &apos;s right in front of me ?
someone who never grows old ...
june , 1953 .
never gets hurt ...
oh , my god , your hand !
is it deep ? how bad is it ?
soone who changes in ways that can &apos;t be explained ...
hey , um , are you ok ?
your eye .
your face .
girls bitten ... what is that ?
oh , my god , what happened to you ?
it &apos;s nothing !
bodies drained off blood ...
did she say what kind of animal it was ?
she said it was a vampire .
donovan ?
no , i &apos;m good .
not it . not it .
not it .
ah , vicki .
hey , man , you ok ?
come here .
come here .
you don &apos;t look good .
come closer .
i have something--
that i have to tell you .
i got you , i got you .
it &apos;s ok . it &apos;s ok .
