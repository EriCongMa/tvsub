my name is elena gilbert , and i &apos;m a vampire .
i &apos;m learning how to survive , but there are complications .
i know that i &apos;m sired to you , damon .
you know what would make me happy ?
that what you actually felt for me was real .
how together are they ?
but there &apos;s hope now .
tell him what the hunter told you
the tattoo leads to .
he said there was a cure .
and we &apos;re not the only ones who want it ...
i want to ram it down niklaus &apos; throat .
but uncovering it comes with a price .
what do you know about silas ?
he &apos;s the world &apos;s first immortal being ,
who just happens to be imprisoned with the cure .
you said it yourself , right ?
whoever finds the cure first
gets to decide what to do with it .
so what do you say , partners ?
the race for the cure has begun ,
and we will stop at nothing to find it .
i was beginning to worry you boys wouldn &apos;t find the place .
did you kill all these people ?
killing them is your job .
no way . i &apos;m not doing it .
what makes you think you have a choice ?
you have to kill vampires to complete the hunter &apos;s mark .
mark equals cure .
you &apos;re in a bar full of almost vampires ,
so get your hunt on .
screw you .
you said i wouldn &apos;t have to kill any innocent people .
jeremy , they &apos;re not people .
enough ! have at it , or else .
i don &apos;t take orders from you , dick .
hunters can &apos;t be compelled .
you &apos;re right . i can &apos;t compel you ,
but if your conscience is getting in the way ,
then allow me to make this easy for you
because i can compel them .
i &apos;m gonna give you a two @-@ minute head start .
then i &apos;m gonna send every vampire in here after you .
you kill them , or they kill your friend ... matt .
wait a second .
no , no . you turn them , he kills them .
that was the deal , klaus .
i &apos;m taking artistic license .
you know he can &apos;t take them all on at the same time .
with you as his coach , he &apos;ll be fine .
it &apos;s matt i &apos;m worried about .
jeremy , go get the weapons out of the car .
i &apos;ll be right behind you .
go with him .
if i hear an engine start ,
i &apos;ll kill matt myself !
are you ok ?
yeah . i just need a second .
we don &apos;t have a second .
they can smell your blood . we need to go .
don &apos;t hesitate . you &apos;re lucky it was me .
otherwise , you two would be dead .
you set us up .
i &apos;m was trying to get this thing over with .
you &apos;re the one that pissed off klaus .
now you have to fight your way out of it .
where are the other vampires ?
they &apos;re newbies . they &apos;re still trying to figure out how to track ,
which means you have two seconds to get ready to fight .
the lake house is this way .
if we can get there , they won &apos;t be able to get inside .
wait . you want to run ?
they &apos;re gonna kill matt .
fine . get out of here . i &apos;ll slow them down .
jeremy , where are you ?
keep going . we &apos;re almost there .
are you ok ?
my god .
get to the house ! hurry !
jeremy , what &apos;s going on ?
they &apos;re coming .
sun &apos;s up .
they &apos;re long gone .
what the hell were you thinking ?
all i asked you to do was to teach him how to fight .
he &apos;s not the best student in the world .
wait . now this is my fault ?
stop talking .
look . i know you &apos;re angry ,
but my way was the easiest , fastest ,
and safest way
to complete his mark to get you the cure .
i don &apos;t care about the cure , damon ,
not if it means putting the people that i love in danger .
hey . there would have been no danger
if he hadn &apos;t gone all bleeding heart .
he killed someone .
these were innocent people .
but the mark grew , didn &apos;t it ?
ok . look . we need a plan .
there &apos;s a group of compelled vampires out there ,
and as soon as the sun goes down ,
they &apos;re gonna come after matt .
so we have to find a away to protect him .
yes , i know ,
but there will be no problem
when big jer and i here go on a hunting expedition .
elena , i know it &apos;s tragic , i get it .
but we also agree that he had to kill them .
now we have added incentive .
so you take the least most valuable player home ,
and jeremy and i will finish this .
i &apos;m sorry . are you saying that i should leave him here with you ?
trust me .
i will keep him safe , ok ?
ahem . i know you were , uh , daggered for a little while ,
but , uh , knocking is still a thing .
so is writing in your diary apparently .
i &apos;m just checking for doubts .
you can never be too cautious when it comes to love .
one minute , you &apos;re begging me
to compel elena from your mind ,
and the next , i &apos;m up coffin creek with a dagger in my back .
right . well , you can read it all you want .
i &apos;m done with her .
until we find the cure , right ?
hey . i &apos;m talking to you .
oh , i know you are . i &apos;m ignoring you .
look . we &apos;re at a bit of a disadvantage in this whole race for the cure .
team klaus has jeremy the hunter .
team shane has bonnie the witch .
if you &apos;re here to remind me of our last place status ,
i &apos;m very well aware .
actually i have a plan .
the cure is buried with silas ,
that ancient evil guy my brother kol is afraid of .
shane was so eager to prove his existence
that he gave away that he has one of the keys to resurrecting him ,
his headstone .
i see . you want to steal it .
yes . and then team shane will have to join team rebekah ,
and team klaus will be left out in the cold where he belongs .
you know , just because your eyes are closed
doesn &apos;t mean you &apos;re meditating .
come on , use your breath .
use your breath to calm your nerves .
great .
so now i can &apos;t even meditate right ?
what else can i fail ?
bonnie , you didn &apos;t fail .
i did an expression spell that almost killed april .
exactly . almost .
failing would have been actually killing her .
you got , like , a d @-@ minus .
it &apos;s not funny .
i have all this power now ,
and i &apos;m worried i won &apos;t be able to control it .
bonnie , look at me .
i &apos;m here with you .
you don &apos;t have anything to worry about .
you are strong , you are focused .
you are in complete control .
you &apos;re here with me .
i &apos;m in complete control .
sheriff ?
bonnie , i &apos;m gonna need you to go .
what the hell are you doing ?
we need to ask you a few questions .
are you serious ?
i &apos;m sure i can answer without the handcuffs .
come on . this isn &apos;t even your jurisdiction .
well , then i guess we better get you to mystic falls asap .
wait . why are you doing this ?
that &apos;s something you should ask your dad .
you really think they went back to the bar ?
where else are they gonna go ?
it &apos;s all cabins and vacation homes .
they can &apos;t get in anywhere .
all right . there you go .
fine . let &apos;s get this over with .
listen . just go one at a time ,
only shoot for the heart ,
don &apos;t hesitate ,
and don &apos;t miss .
save the teaching moment .
elena &apos;s not here .
you don &apos;t have to pretend like you give a damn about me .
i &apos;m trying to keep you alive , dumbass .
come on .
something &apos;s not right .
looks like we &apos;re gonna have to find some new vampires .
what a waste .
what the hell happened ?
i confess .
i did it .
kol .
jeremy , good to see you , mate .
sorry about the mess .
it was a little crowded when i arrived ,
and i prefer more intimate gatherings .
we 3 need to have a little chat .
care for a drink ?
he &apos;s underage , and i don &apos;t like you ,
so let &apos;s just cut to it .
my brother bragged about
his plan to complete jeremy &apos;s hunter &apos;s mark .
it was easy enough to track this lot down .
they were all hiding in the shadows .
now killing young vampires is easy
or old ones for that matter .
why ? what &apos;s it to you either way ?
because , you fools , in your zeal to find the cure ,
you risk waking someone very dangerous .
oh . you must be talking about silas .
what do you know of him ?
nothing . don &apos;t want to . not our problem .
isn &apos;t it ?
a few hundred years back ,
i came across a group that worshiped silas .
his followers told me that he would rise again ,
and when he did , he would trigger the end of all time .
you know , being an immortal ,
you can see why i &apos;m opposed to time &apos;s ending .
i murdered all of them ,
and now here you are willing to risk raising him
in your search for the cure .
i can &apos;t exactly sit back and let that happen , can i ?
we &apos;re not gonna back off the cure
because you were told one too many scary bedtime stories , you idiot .
jeremy , we were mates in colorado .
you &apos;re a smart lad .
why don &apos;t you call off this imbecilic treasure hunt ?
i &apos;m not calling anything off , mate .
well , i could kill you ,
but then i &apos;d have to deal with the hunter &apos;s curse ,
and i--i don &apos;t particularly feel like being haunted for the next century .
better idea .
i &apos;ll just rip off your arms .
jeremy , run !
well ... headstone &apos;s not here .
don &apos;t ripper out on me .
we &apos;ll find it .
you &apos;re all bottled up .
you need a release .
maybe we can find you a voodoo doll or something .
this should do the trick .
exactly what you need .
the professor &apos;s stash of herbs .
not interested .
what happened to you ? you were so much fun in the twenties .
i was a psychotic killer with no emotions in the 1920s .
you may have been a killer ,
but you were far from emotionless , stefan .
you had a blast . i know you remember .
the jazz , the booze , our little table at gloria &apos;s .
don &apos;t make me compel it out of you .
all right .
i guess we had a little bit of fun .
thank you .
so now that we &apos;ve established that fun is , in fact , possible ,
maybe you &apos;d like to start having some .
don &apos;t worry about the professor .
he won &apos;t be back any time soon . i made sure of that .
you &apos;re accusing me of orchestrating a mass murder ?
do you know how ridiculous that sounds .
it &apos;s mystic falls .
it &apos;s actually one of the least ridiculous things i &apos;ve heard .
he already explained this , dad .
pastor young came to him for help . he was crazy .
no . hew was grief @-@ stricken ,
and shane took advantage of it .
and somehow talked him into killing a house full of people .
it doesn &apos;t make any sense .
i &apos;ve met people like this , bonnie .
they &apos;re fast @-@ talking , they &apos;re charismatic , they &apos;re manipulators .
they prey on the weak @-@ minded .
and you &apos;re worried that &apos;s what he &apos;s doing to me .
that &apos;s why you brought him in , isn &apos;t it ?
no . we brought him in because
april young told us what he did .
rebekah mikaelson confirmed it .
he confessed to her .
i &apos;m going in there .
bonnie , no , you &apos;re not .
if he &apos;s gonna tell anyone what he did , it &apos;s me .
unless of course you think i &apos;m too weak @-@ minded .
bonnie , now is not the time .
let her talk .
i think your dad &apos;s confused about
the format of the parent @-@ teacher conference .
i &apos;m so sorry .
rebekah told them you confessed .
i know she &apos;s lying .
you know , the truth is , she &apos;s not .
i &apos;m so sorry . listen .
when i asked you to stay to jeremy , i never thought--
what did you expect , elena ?
it &apos;s damon .
i never wanted anyone to get hurt .
then you shouldn &apos;t have left him in charge .
look . i &apos;m sorry . i know you didn &apos;t have a choice--
sire bond and all .
sire bond doesn &apos;t work like that .
all i know , elena , is that
the old you would have never left jeremy with damon ,
especially after what happened last night .
jeremy ?
elena , we &apos;re in trouble .
whoa , whoa , whoa . slow down .
where &apos;s damon ?
listen to me . kol attacked us .
i barely got away , but he &apos;s got damon .
a bit ironic you coming to me for help .
weren &apos;t your friends just trying to bury me in a cement tomb ?
this is your fault .
you started this when you forced jeremy to kill those vampires .
and my little brat of a brother has gone and made things worse .
he never did like damon .
i suppose i should do something , shouldn &apos;t i ?
call him off , klaus .
you are in no position to make demands , love .
whilst i &apos;d like to cure you to make more hybrids ,
i do have other reasons for finding the cure ,
not the least of which is destroying it
so you lot can &apos;t use it against me .
whatever our differences ,
we want the same thing .
please . klaus , i &apos;m begging you .
little brother .
just two days home ,
and i &apos;m told you &apos;ve already gone and made a mess .
come on , nik . i was only having some fun .
those vampires were for my hunter .
i &apos;ll make some more . there &apos;s no shortage of people .
where &apos;s damon salvatore .
i gave him a good and proper beating
just for old time &apos;s sake .
yes . well , you &apos;ve had your fun .
now let him go and come home .
avoid any more trouble ,
or you &apos;ll find yourself back in a box .
hey . no need to be nasty about it .
on the contrary , i find nastiness to be essential
whenever my siblings try to sabotage me .
listen closely , kol .
stay away from the gilbert boy .
understand ?
fine . i won &apos;t touch him .
you have my word .
very good , darling .
now stab yourself a little bit further .
if you &apos;re gonna kill me , do it like a man .
i don &apos;t want to kill you .
i just wanted to make sure you could be compelled .
i &apos;m gonna rip out your spleen .
you ought to be thanking me .
you don &apos;t really want the cure found .
you fancy elena .
i mean , even more now that she &apos;s a vampire .
admit it .
the last vestige of her humanity
is her annoying little brother jeremy .
and deep , deep down , i bet you want him dead , don &apos;t you ?
nope .
you &apos;re lying .
i bet you &apos;d love to rip his head right off ...
and i &apos;m gonna give you your wish .
you &apos;re not gonna remember what i say ,
but you &apos;re going to find jeremy gilbert ,
and when you do ,
you &apos;re going to kill him .
jeremy , it &apos;s over .
you can put all this away .
klaus still wants me to finish the mark .
he &apos;s not gonna stop .
ok . well , damon &apos;s gonna be back soon ,
and then we can figure something out .
seriously ? you still trust damon ?
he saved your life .
he saved the map to the cure .
he couldn &apos;t care less about me .
i care about you .
don &apos;t .
whatever &apos;s inside of me that makes me want to hunt ,
right now it &apos;s on overdrive .
jeremy .
i &apos;m sorry .
i know what i have to do , elena .
i really want to get that cure for you ,
but ...
i just--i don &apos;t how i &apos;m gonna do this .
so much random crap in here .
crap , maybe . random , no .
looks like shane has a bit of an afterlife fetish .
hopi prayer feathers , the han dynasty soul vase ,
and that is a polynesian sacrificial knife .
brutal way to die , but at least you appease the gods .
since when did you become such an artifact expert ?
i enjoy other cultures , stefan .
i know that might be hard for you to understand
considering you dated a child who only thinks about herself .
still a sensitive subject , i see .
do you know why
i wouldn &apos;t compel elena from your memory ?
because you wanted me to suffer .
i did . it &apos;s the only way you &apos;ll learn .
it took me a thousand years
and hundreds of betrayals to realize
that love , caring ruins you .
that &apos;s awfully bleak .
quite the opposite .
it &apos;s liberating actually .
you know why we had so much fun
in the twenties , stefan ?
because we didn &apos;t care .
we just did what felt good--
drinking , feeding , sex .
the sex wasn &apos;t good because we didn &apos;t care .
it was good because you &apos;re crazy .
crazy sex is always good .
you were hardly the model of sanity .
stop ... caring .
good . you found it .
question is who are you ?
what happened ? are you ok ?
kol happened .
thank god you both got away .
if kol had taken jeremy .
is he here ? i just want to talk to him really fast .
he &apos;s at the grill . he wanted to check on matt .
i should go apologize to him .
i was--i was pretty tough on him today .
told my dad to give us a minute .
camera &apos;s off .
you can talk .
are you sure about that ?
yeah . i don &apos;t lie . i &apos;m not you .
look . i was always gonna tell you the truth .
i just kept putting it off
because i was worried how you &apos;d react .
bad . that &apos;s how i react to murder .
i &apos;m not a killer , bonnie .
pastor young was depressed ,
i &apos;ve heard this .
skip to the part where you convince him to massacre 11 people .
it wasn &apos;t a massacre . it was a ritual .
it was something necessary to raise silas
and get the cure that your friends so desperately want .
if they knew people had to die ...
it doesn &apos;t matter if they die .
silas will bring them back .
you &apos;re crazy .
i &apos;m not crazy .
i &apos;m just passionate .
you &apos;re full on crazy .
do you remember our first session ?
it was about your grams , right ?
you thought every time you did magic you were causing her pain .
aren &apos;t you curious what &apos;s happening to her now ?
wouldn &apos;t you like to see her again ?
don &apos;t you ever take a night off ?
i took two days off to help you out at the lake house , remember ?
i almost got killed .
where &apos;s jeremy ?
he &apos;s in the back i think .
are you doing ok ?
yeah . all things considered .
damon .
are you all right ?
what &apos;s going on ?
damon , what is wrong with you ?
it was kol .
he must have compelled me .
if i find jeremy ,
i might kill him .
jeremy .
get out of here !
do you hear me ?
don &apos;t stop .
kol compelled me . there &apos;s nothing i can do !
you can &apos;t hide in here , jer .
if i find you , you &apos;re dead .
jeremy , are you listening to me ?
you better run !
i am coming to kill you .
you need to go now !
all you have to do to make it stop is tell me who sent you .
you &apos;re full of vervain ,
so i know you haven &apos;t been compelled .
or maybe somebody compelled him before he ingested it .
he was after the headstone .
we need to know who sent him .
ok . fine . so we take him home ,
wait till the vervain is out of his system ,
and then compel him and get whatever information we want .
that &apos;s not a bad idea .
he just bit off his own tongue .
so he does know something .
i guess he was compelled .
was it my bastard brother or yours ?
maybe it &apos;s option number 3 .
there &apos;s another team in the race .
you &apos;re saying if i help you
raise silas you can bring my grams back ?
don &apos;t play on my guilt , shane .
i &apos;m not playing on anything .
this is the truth . you told me what happened .
your reckless use of magic is the reason ...
don &apos;t .
is the reason those spirits
are torturing her on the other side .
don &apos;t .
hurting her again and again and again .
i said don &apos;t !
my hand !
you can &apos;t stop , can you ?
all this power that you &apos;re feeling ,
you actually like it , don &apos;t you ?
look at yourself , bonnie .
look at yourself , bonnie .
bonnie , what are you doing ?
get ...
out of here .
bonnie , stop !
you can &apos;t reason with her , mayor . she &apos;s lost control .
bonnie , baby , baby . please .
do something !
bonnie ...
bonnie , look at me !
now take a deep breath .
i &apos;m right here with you .
you are in complete control .
that &apos;s it .
your daughter ... is a prodigy .
with my guidance ...
she &apos;ll be one of the most powerful witches in the world ...
but without it ...
she &apos;s a time bomb .
hello , elena .
what did you to stefan ?
rescued him from his old , dull life ,
but it keeps calling .
stefan &apos;s not in the mood to talk right now .
then he can listen .
i know you might not care about me right now , stefan ,
but kol compelled damon to kill jeremy .
they &apos;re somewhere in the tunnels , and i--
it &apos;s one giant maze down here ,
and i can &apos;t find them , so if you still care about
the cure or about jeremy , then maybe you can come help .
ok .
that is an interesting predicament
for both of us .
did you miss the part where i said i &apos;m compelled ?
don &apos;t stop !
seriously ?
you &apos;re being hunted by a vampire ,
and now you &apos;re bleeding ?
dumb move , jer .
you can &apos;t fight me in closed quarters .
it was worth a shot .
you &apos;re gonna have to shoot me , jeremy , in the heart .
i &apos;m not gonna be able to stop myself .
jeremy , you are a hunter .
you know want to .
do it .
do it !
he shot me in the head .
stupid idiot ...
borderline brain @-@ dead moron !
that was dumb , jeremy .
should have killed me when you had the chance .
going somewhere ?
i would if i were you .
if damon kills the hunter ,
nik will not be pleased .
i told nik i wouldn &apos;t touch the kid .
i didn &apos;t .
that was clever .
i &apos;m sure he &apos;ll really appreciate it .
you &apos;d really dagger me ?
if i do , damon &apos;s compulsion ends and this is all over .
and then you &apos;re no better than niklaus .
daggering siblings when you disagree with them .
look at what this family has become .
i mean , elijah won &apos;t even show his face ,
he &apos;s so disgusted by our bickering .
this cure has ruined us ,
and it hasn &apos;t even been found yet .
just imagine what would happen if it is .
this family was ruined long before we knew about the cure .
kol !
i won &apos;t let you raise silas .
enough of this foolishness .
put it down , kol .
he was going to kill me .
well , then , i think you need a lesson
in how to properly dagger a sibling .
burn in hell .
damon , stop !
please .
i know that you don &apos;t want to hurt jeremy ,
so please stop .
i can &apos;t .
yes , you can .
you &apos;re strong enough to resist the compulsion .
i know that you are .
why , because stefan did ?
because i love you , because you love me .
you &apos;d do anything for me , so please ...
do this for me .
i &apos;m sorry , elena .
damon !
jeremy .
shoot now .
brother . long time , no see .
you &apos;re welcome .
easy there , buddy .
you lost a lot of blood .
so you bled me out ?
yeah . i didn &apos;t really have much of a choice .
kol &apos;s compulsion is still in effect ,
so you need to stay locked up .
we don &apos;t have any vervain , so ...
this was the only way i could weaken you .
you sound real torn up about it .
shouldn &apos;t we be going after kol ,
make him decompel me .
yeah , yeah , sure . that sounds easy enough , damon .
i &apos;ll get right on that .
please let me see elena .
come on . you know you can &apos;t do that .
with the sire bond ,
all you have to do is tell her to let you out of here .
it &apos;s too risky .
you &apos;re really enjoying this , aren &apos;t you ?
it &apos;s better for elena if you stay in here for now ,
at least until we find the cure ,
and then once she &apos;s no longer sired
and you &apos;re no longer compelled ,
you can both do whatever the hell you want .
stefan , wait . stefan !
stef ...
going to see damon ?
i need to talk to him .
well , you can &apos;t . he &apos;ll just ask you to let him out .
i won &apos;t let him out .
you won &apos;t have a choice .
you &apos;re sired .
that all ?
stefan , what are you doing with rebekah ?
she tried to kill me .
and this will be the second time that
damon tried to kill jeremy .
so i guess nobody &apos;s perfect , right ?
are you trying to punish me ?
i don &apos;t know how many times i can apologize .
i never asked you to .
you can do whatever you want , elena .
i really don &apos;t care .
you &apos;re hurt .
you &apos;re hurt , and you &apos;re acting out , stefan .
this isn &apos;t you .
sure it is .
you &apos;ve just never seen me like this .
you don &apos;t know what i look like
when i &apos;m not in love with you .
i &apos;ll let damon know you stopped by .
i owe you an apology .
you don &apos;t owe me anything .
i &apos;m not happy to be right .
i &apos;m gonna get you some help .
help ? dad , i &apos;m ok .
are you kidding me ?
i got angry i admit ,
but i knew what i was doing .
you lost control , and shane said--
didn &apos;t we just establish that we couldn &apos;t trust him ?
he &apos;s trying to get under your skin .
the only thing that got under my skin is what i saw ,
which is my daughter using dangerous magic !
and the fact that you don &apos;t think you need help
means you need it even more .
good evening , gilbert clan .
what do you want , klaus ?
i &apos;ve come to fetch my hunter .
seeing as how my brother &apos;s become a liability ,
jeremy will be safer with me .
i think i &apos;ll pass .
i &apos;ve killed enough people for you today .
you think you &apos;re safer here ? hmm .
clearly you don &apos;t know kol .
he &apos;ll stop at nothing to get what he wants ,
so strange as it may seem , i &apos;m your best bet .
sorry , but i think we &apos;d rather take our chances .
fine , but when kol does come--
and he will come--
be sure to let me know ,
preferably before he burns your nice little home to the ground .
and as for you , hunter ,
there &apos;s no shortage of people to turn
and loved ones to threaten , so sleep well .
we &apos;ll plan on finishing our work tomorrow .
sure . just barge right in .
oh . i thought not knocking was our thing .
you didn &apos;t dagger kol .
well , the white oak stake pointed at my heart
made things a little difficult .
i do believe my brother kol has finally lost his mind .
that &apos;s all right . jeremy &apos;s still alive ,
and i took care of damon .
so where &apos;d you put it ?
the headstone ?
someplace safe .
wasn &apos;t really our deal .
well , considering that you &apos;ve betrayed me twice .
and i betrayed you never .
i think i &apos;m acting brilliantly ,
especially since we have no idea why that guy was looking for it .
did you work things out with elena ?
do you care ?
nope , just trying to figure out why you &apos;re here .
you don &apos;t even have to ask .
no feelings , no attachments .
none .
whatsoever .
this is never gonna end .
if kol doesn &apos;t kill me first ,
then klaus is just gonna force me to kill more innocent people .
how many is it gonna take ,
10 , 100 ?
if you kill one original vampire ,
their entire sire line will die with them .
that &apos;s thousands , maybe tens of thousands of vampires .
kol compelled damon to kill you .
you &apos;re gonna kill kol instead .
