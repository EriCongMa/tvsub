第五季 第十二集
advice on these wedding invites .
i like calligraphy option number two ,
it looks like a bone thugs album .
this looks like an ad for a bone company .
i like option one better .
you know what would be nice ?
a wedding invitation engraved on a plate .
what a magical wedding that would be .
you two are imbeciles .
anybody with taste and sophistication
would always choose option number two .
are you okay ?
you look gray .
i didn &apos;t sleep .
i was up preparing for an epic day of wedding decisions .
i &apos;m calling it d @-@ day .
of course , in this situation ,
the &quot; d &quot; stands for &quot; decisions , &quot;
and unlike the other d @-@ day ,
it will not be a walk on the beach .
that &apos;s incredibly offensive .
i know .
do you guys remember
that audition i had for gas station tv ?
well , the girl they hired went missing
and they need me to fill in !
what ?
oh , my god , we &apos;re gonna be friends with a gas celebrity !
that &apos;s right !
but it is today ,
and i know you need my help with the wedding stuff ...
cece , what are you talking about ? are you crazy ?
you have to go to this .
i can do it all by my ... by myself .
are you okay ?
wow , your mouth has been open forever .
okay , this is crazy . i &apos;m just gonna stay home .
no , cece , you have to go , please .
it &apos;s ... it &apos;s ...
okay .
i &apos;ll be fine . i &apos;ll be fine .
i can help with wedding stuff .
just lighten the load a little bit .
sometimes i think
i was bred in a lab to help people .
you know what else they bred in the lab ?
pugs .
thank you , jess . that would be great .
uh , no , cece .
i don &apos;t have time to bring her up to speed .
throwing her into the fray now
would be like putting a baby on a treadmill .
she would ... just shoot off .
baby , you &apos;re just being protective of the wedding , okay ?
jess is just gonna help .
she &apos;s not gonna take over .
jess ...
what &apos;s happening here ?
fine .
who &apos;s excited ?
there we go .
ooh , fyi , you may have to wrestle
a rectal nutrient into him .
wait , what ?
you &apos;re right . not your job .
i &apos;ve done it before .
i mean , i didn &apos;t like it , but ...
i did it .
am i proud of it ? no .
did i do it ? yes .
have i done it again since ? no .
there &apos;s tons to do today ,
so we &apos;re going to have to split up .
i have to be here for a tux fitting
and a meeting with a napkin ring genius .
gonna be fine .
there &apos;s chairs to be picked and ...
cakes to be tasted .
schmidt ? are you asleep ?
what ? !
no , i &apos;m not sleeping , of course i &apos;m not sleeping !
just tons ... too much to do today to sleep .
jess ...
this is the most important thing that i own .
it is the wedding flash drive .
everything that you need to know is on this .
it &apos;s color @-@ coded .
ooh , color @-@ coded . gimme .
please do not reach for it
like you &apos;re winston reaching for someone &apos;s breast .
treat it with respect .
i will , and i just want to say
i &apos;m honored you &apos;re trusting me .
oh , i &apos;m not .
everything i see is terrible .
pan left .
this one &apos;s nice .
comfortable , but not too comfortable .
we want people to dance .
folding chairs ?
jess , if i wanted my wedding to be an aa meeting ,
i would &apos;ve called my aunt terry .
i don &apos;t think you want to marry this guy .
who is that ?
oh , finally .
winston ,
where have you been ?
i &apos;ve been waiting an hour .
work was crazy , okay ?
i busted a poker room ,
which was a front for a crack house ,
which was a front for a brothel .
it was a crime turducken .
this is the third time you &apos;ve stood me up .
meat lunch is our oldest and proudest tradition .
let &apos;s do this every year for the rest of our lives .
i &apos;m gonna be a lawyer .
let &apos;s eat .
i can &apos;t . i had an hour , i gotta go back to work .
i mean ...
you know , it &apos;s a ... it &apos;s a bar
in the middle of the day . like , who &apos;s there ?
why are they there ? why do you need to be there ?
&apos;cause it &apos;s my job .
it runs itself . it &apos;s basically a big @-@ ass fridge .
i &apos;m a bartender and owner .
you know how many balls i have to juggle now ?
man , those are baby balls .
i &apos;m a cop .
i spend my day working the city &apos;s balls .
listen to yourself .
those balls are big .
listen to yourself .
i &apos;m listening to myself , nick .
your balls , in comparison to my balls ,
that you have to deal with , that i have to handle ...
if you think your job is so much harder than my job ,
then why don &apos;t you come see for yourself ?
unless , of course , you &apos;re scared .
scared ?
scared .
i &apos;m a cop .
i run a bar .
welcome to the nerve center .
over here , you &apos;ve got accounts payable--
bills , to the layperson--
and over here is the schedule .
it &apos;s a numbers game , really .
who works when and why ,
square pegs , round holes ,
every man is a mystery ...
that &apos;s great , nick .
um , i &apos;m a cop .
come in !
hey , nick , what &apos;s the schedule for the weekend ?
oh , great , everybody &apos;s here .
why don &apos;t you ask my friend winston ?
he &apos;ll be handling all questions .
yeah , that &apos;s easy .
all right .
i &apos;m ready to taste cakes .
okay , great .
this is gonna be fun .
i &apos;m sorry , fun ?
baking scones with winston is fun .
this is serious , jess .
soft and sweet .
what a relief it &apos;s not hard and salty .
how is the nose ?
does it have a clean finish ,
or would you say it &apos;s a long cake ?
describe the cake &apos;s legs in terms of mouth feel .
bro , i spent two hours at the chair place .
you picked nothing .
you negotiated with the florist
until all three of us were crying .
let &apos;s start again and put the camera close to the frosting .
and for god &apos;s sakes , please , be mindful of your friggin &apos; shadow .
no . i &apos;m stopping this .
you &apos;re stop-- you &apos;re stopping what ?
j @-@ jess ?
what are ... what are you doing ?
why am i looking at a fountain now ?
what ...
what a relaxing water feature .
my body &apos;s saying let &apos;s go
are they playing christina there ?
but my heart &apos;s saying no
if you want to be me with me
baby , there &apos;s a price to pay
i &apos;m a genie in a bottle
you gotta rub me the right way
if you want to be with me ...
hey , gal pal . how &apos;s going ?
great ! it &apos;s exactly like modeling ,
except for it &apos;s less cold and i get to talk .
how &apos;s ?
he &apos;s not stress @-@ eating paper towels again , is he ?
no , everything &apos;s fine .
i &apos;m supposed to see a beverage guy ,
but i can &apos;t find his address .
seriously ? i can come back and help .
no ! it &apos;s just ...
it &apos;s fine .
schmidt has this color @-@ coded system ,
and i can &apos;t figure out which one .
do you know which one beverages would be ?
i don &apos;t know . blue ?
you &apos;re a genius . i found it .
okay , i gotta go learn spanish .
i told him that i know it .
good luck .
gavin , wine sales , calabasas .
i didn &apos;t do it !
i &apos;m lying .
i obviously did it .
don &apos;t worry .
we just put those there for people to break .
really ?
no , they were very expensive .
but i own the place ,
so why don &apos;t we say this one broke , too ?
i &apos;m gavin .
let &apos;s try this one .
tempting , but my friends are getting married .
i &apos;m kind of on a deadline .
and also i prefer my wine sparkling , pink and under $ 11 .
just taste it .
okay , one glass .
javier , you take the early shift
on ... saturday .
ugh .
come on , listen ,
i got to do what i got to do , you know ?
uh , gina , wait to induce
until sunday ... afternoon .
gina , don &apos;t you have something on sunday ?
my husband has his fantasy baseball league .
he won &apos;t attend the birth if it doesn &apos;t happen .
that &apos;s not the man you should be with , i &apos;m sorry .
all right , where do you want these ?
winston , where do we want these ?
where do we want ... ? winston ? no , dude .
i don &apos;t know you like that , man .
put &apos; em where the beer goes .
come on , man , i got eight more deliveries .
look , i don &apos;t like the early shift .
mercy ?
yes ! yes , yes , man .
that &apos;s what i thought .
cheese , the keg &apos;s gonna go where it always goes ,
right behind the bar .
guys , the schedule .
oh , that &apos;s perfect . thanks .
that works ?
back to work , everybody . good stuff .
listen , i get it .
this is confusing and everything ,
and i can &apos;t just walk in off the street
and do your job instantaneously .
but come on .
let &apos;s be real .
it &apos;s still not harder than being a cop .
then prove it .
oh , i &apos;ll prove it .
look , i know i told you to prove it ,
but i got to get back to the bar .
i just got a text from javier that said ,
&quot; fire extinguisher &quot; question mark .
well , all i got to say is , buckle up , miller .
it &apos;s about to be a bumpy ride .
uh , where ... where are my sunglasses ?
how the hell should i know ?
i specifically asked you to keep track of my sunglasses .
and i told you i &apos;m not your freaking mother .
okay , you know what , calm down , i &apos;ll just squint then .
do what you got to do , man .
is this how all partners talk to each other ?
welcome to hell , miller .
i &apos;m no good at normal life ,
but when i &apos;m in the ocean and drinking wine ...
or spending time with a beautiful stranger ...
that &apos;s when i , uh , truly feel like myself .
how do you feel about a little manchego ?
i feel very good about it .
we &apos;re not animals .
or maybe we are .
have you ever ... ?
i have too much manchego .
happens to the best of us .
have you ever had your eyebrows combed
by a woman you just met ?
yes .
jess , thank you .
you know , i haven &apos;t had two hours of uninterrupted sleep
since a month ago when cece made me watch an inconvenient truth .
everything &apos;s under control . the bakery &apos;s sending over
three cakes for you to try .
okay .
and gavin from the winery in calabasas gave me a great deal .
uh , you met gavin in calabasas ?
i didn &apos;t just meet him , we kissed a little .
no !
schmidt , what happened ? what &apos;s wrong ?
you just made out with my dad .
schmidt .
can i just say one thing ?
hey , guys .
so , how did it go today ?
good .
we got a lot accomplished .
but , um ...
how do i say this ? um ...
i made out with schmidt &apos;s dad .
you did what ?
she lulled me to sleep and then went rogue .
you did what ?
if your files had been clearly marked ,
none of this would be happening .
you need better labels .
everything is perfectly clear .
chairs are color @-@ coded under chartreuse ,
because it sounds like &quot; chair truths . &quot;
salmon mongers are filed under fuchsia ,
because i &quot; re @-@ fuchsia &quot; to serve salmon at this wedding .
the groomsmen tuxes are under magenta ,
because &quot; ma @-@ gentlemen &quot; will be wearing the dope tuxes .
is he a good kisser ?
don &apos;t ask that ,
plea ... and don &apos;t you answer it .
it &apos;s withdrawn . i &apos;m just freaking out right now .
okay , why don &apos;t we take this horrible ,
horrible , gross mistake into something positive ?
what if this is a sign
that maybe you should reach out and talk to your dad again ?
why ?
why would i talk to my dad ?
he left my mom and basically missed my entire childhood .
and every time i did invite him to something ,
he never showed up : middle school graduation ,
high school graduation ,
when i played the titular role
in a stage adaptation of uncle buck .
well , he &apos;s taken up surfing now .
oh , he &apos;s taken up surfing ? how nice .
a middle @-@ aged man who surfs and french @-@ kisses his customers .
what a hero .
why did you have his number in the wedding drive at all ?
because i was maybe ...
warming up to the idea of inviting him ,
but now that the nightmare
called &quot; this afternoon &quot; has happened ,
i can very well see that i &apos;m not ready .
so i &apos;m sorry , jess , but there will be no papa nah @-@ nah
at the wedding for you .
i &apos;m sorry ! he was feeding me cheese , and i ...
i d ...
please stop .
so many details .
please .
and @-@ and god for ... if you ...
just ...
if the words &quot; he unbuttoned my &quot; comes out of your mouth ,
i &apos;m gonna freak out !
oh , thank god , winston .
you &apos;re saving the city from a palm frond .
los angeles can sleep soundly tonight , everybody .
all right , it was a slow @-@ ass day .
aly , will you tell him it &apos;s a slow @-@ ass day ?
no , i &apos;m not getting involved in this .
i &apos;m not gonna be the yardstick in a penis measuring contest .
did you say &quot; yard &quot; ?
wow , who are you dating ?
tape measure , fine .
okay , look , this has been great ,
uh , but i got to get back to the bar .
dispatcher : 7 @-@ 8 @-@ 6 @-@ 3 .
possible 4 @-@ 5 @-@ 9 at 2 @-@ 7 @-@ 3 elm cross and fairbanks .
hell yes .
4 @-@ 2 @-@ 4 responding . over .
bar boy , get in .
aly , let &apos;s lock and load .
is your gun not loaded ?
you have to load your gun , winston .
oh , no .
schmidt , um , that &apos;s your dad .
what ?
what @-@ what is my dad doing at our front door ?
he thinks we &apos;re going on a date .
why would he think that , jess ?
because i said , &quot; let &apos;s go on a date . &quot;
i &apos;ll get rid of him . go to your room and close the door .
do not tell me what to do ; you are not my mom .
oh , that &apos;s disgusting .
just go . go .
wait . wait , wait .
i don &apos;t trust you .
hey , gavin !
i know what this is .
i &apos;m not falling for it .
you don &apos;t have to stage a crime
to make your job look hard .
stay here . make yourself as small a target as possible .
i &apos;ll just be here
napping out of boredom .
i see signs of forced entry .
wait , wait , wait , wait ! i got movement !
i &apos;m shaking in my boots !
oh , yeah , right , he &apos;s ru--
halt ! police !
no !
no ! get away ! get out !
okay , i get it !
your job is way harder than mine !
just make the bad man go away !
what ?
put the gun down !
yeah , my job is much harder !
we &apos;re gonna make him go away !
can &apos;t stand to see nick like this , you know .
at least now , he understands being a cop
is much harder than being a bartender .
we all got to learn that lesson sometime .
idiot , he doesn &apos;t think his job is harder .
he just wants you to see
that he &apos;s grown and changed
and whatever else stupid stuff people care about .
why are you looking at me like that ?
no , no , i ...
that &apos;s why i need my damn sunglasses , man !
you shouldn &apos;t have them
if you can &apos;t keep track of them , winston .
come on , yeah .
no ! no !
hey , scoot over .
no , not in here ! not in here , no ! no !
you have the right to remain silent .
no ! no !
what are you doing with a video camera on your head ?
he is handsome .
that &apos;s a good question .
oh , hey , look .
that &apos;s @-@ that &apos;s good news for you , okay .
it &apos;s for work .
i still hate him .
they want to make sure that we don &apos;t teach evolution .
i &apos;m an educator , so ...
oh , you told me .
i believe you had me pressed up
against a cask of merlot at the time .
he &apos;s a bottom ?
you want to give me the tour ?
or should we just crack this open and make out ?
what a line .
who is this clown ?
bottle opener in here ?
well ... oh .
oh , actually ,
um , change of plans-- i can &apos;t go on a date tonight ,
because i have to have dinner with one of my friends &apos; fathers ,
coincidentally .
no pressure .
it &apos;s just that i had a lot of fun today .
and , uh ,
i &apos;d like to see you again .
what was that ?
gunshots-- the neighborhood &apos;s in a real slide .
this is my son &apos;s name .
7 billion people .
there &apos;s got to be some overlap .
we &apos;d better get you back to calabasas , mister .
wait a minute .
&apos;cause ...
this is my son !
oh , my god , do you know my son ?
kind of .
does he live here ?
is he here right now ?
i didn &apos;t know you were schmidt &apos;s dad when we kissed .
and you didn &apos;t know i was his roommate .
and those are facts that will haunt us forever .
but i can &apos;t let you go in there .
because ... he &apos;s not ready to see you .
and for once today , i ... - okay .
i want to respect his wishes .
i get it .
um , wait , wait , wait , wait .
no , i &apos;ll go .
wait , wait .
what ?
he &apos;s in there .
she told him .
son ?
babe , i think you should watch .
i don &apos;t ...
son .
you should watch .
i know you &apos;re mad . i get it .
do you want me to take this off ?
i didn &apos;t do a good job being your father .
you &apos;re in a zone . i &apos;m just gonna sit tight .
and now you &apos;re getting married .
i get it .
i wouldn &apos;t have invited me , either .
i &apos;ve missed a lot .
i &apos;m sorry .
in my defense ,
i was stoned for most of the &apos; 90s .
and the 2000s .
full disclosure-- i was stoned this morning .
i like weed .
but the point is ,
if you can forgive me even a little ,
i &apos;d love to have a drink with you .
and meet the man that you &apos;ve become .
come on .
gavin .
that &apos;s okay-- gavin , not dad .
that &apos;s just where i &apos;m at right now .
understood .
i &apos;m grateful you &apos;re calling me anything at all .
i wanted to say i &apos;m sorry .
and i know that it might not seem genuine ,
because the only reason i came here today
was to do stuff with your roommate .
but in the past ten years ,
i must &apos;ve picked up that phone to call you and apologize
a hundred times .
i really am sorry .
gavin , this is my fiancé cece .
she is the reason that i am the man that i am today .
it &apos;s wonderful to meet you , cece .
i &apos;m the terrible father .
thank you .
because whatever you did or didn &apos;t do ,
schmidt turned out amazing .
all right .
i &apos;m gonna head out .
i &apos;m sure it will be a beautiful wedding .
i wasn &apos;t very good at being married .
but thankfully you seem like you &apos;re nothing like me .
for what it &apos;s worth ,
i like the second option .
timeless .
i agree .
good @-@ bye .
okay , wa-- uh ...
wait , uh ...
here , that &apos;s for you .
let &apos;s see if you can show up this time .
i hope that you do .
thank you .
there &apos;s no plus one , so don &apos;t even ask .
i &apos;ll be there .
back to square one on the seating chart .
sorry , i &apos;m a little bit jumpy .
god , they should really make a tv show
based off what you guys do .
you know , i &apos;ve been telling that to aly since forever !
it &apos;d be a great idea .
hello , hollywood !
it &apos;s a big show !
yeah , it &apos;s a hit .
i want to apologize .
i &apos;m sorry that i thought my job was harder than yours .
it &apos;s not . i &apos;m just making schedules
and buying beer .
look , man .
the whole thing has been pretty idiotic .
you know , uh , my job is harder than yours .
yes , that &apos;s a fact . we all know it .
but i got to say , man , this is first time
i &apos;ve seen you really care about your job .
you &apos;re killing it .
it means a lot to me that you said that .
so thank you . - yeah , yeah .
so , look , i got ... i got us burgers .
you know , i figured we &apos;re both too busy for steak .
the tradition !
nick , i need a drink .
it &apos;d better be green , sweet and in a fun glass .
schmidt , are you okay ?
i mean , you look a little freaked ...
oh ... oh @-@ oh , cece ! cece &apos;s pregnant !
no .
jess made out with schmidt &apos;s dad .
oh , my god !
so many emotions .
well , i mean , did you like it ?
don &apos;t answer that .
ew , it was schmidt &apos;s dad .
you &apos;re not answering the question .
no , she &apos;s not answering the question .
sweetie , you don &apos;t have to say anything .
i liked it a little bit .
dude .
