sil &apos;s been raggin &apos; on me all week for me to play &apos; em here .
their manager or somebody owes him money .
so , i thought this was your day off . chrissy &apos;s away .
i don &apos;t like stayin &apos; home alone .
although , at least i can pour a glass of wine
without him givin &apos; me &quot; the expression . &quot;
yeah . yeah , i know that look.the constipated owl look .
you know , when i first met you i was scared of you .

it &apos;s always my first reaction .
well , you &apos;re not scared of me now , are you ?

come on , get up . come on .
aw , shit.all right .
wait .
yeah , go on .
tony here ?
yeah , come on in .
let me know if you guys need anything .
what , are you gonna tell me about the traffic again ?
here , our friend sent this for you .
thank you for taking the appointment .
and i know i &apos;m on probation , and i deeply regret ...
what i did .
my nephew &apos;s fiancee .
i know what you &apos;re thinking .
so ? well , nothing happened ,
but it could &apos;ve very easily .
i mean , she really got to me , this young lady . she , uh ...
what ? this is a very big step .
yeah , tell me about it .
i mean , that you &apos;ve come here to talk about this impulse
instead of just acting on it without thinking .
no , i always think.- really ?
yeah .
having sex with your mistress &apos; cousin ,
like the mistress wasn &apos;t enough to piss off your wife .
tell me about the niece .
she &apos;s drop @-@ dead gorgeous .
someone like her i could ...
i could do it right this time , i could start a whole new family .
i &apos;m young enough .
fuck &apos; em all .
and this is something you &apos;re contemplating ?
what ? it would be a disaster of major proportions .
carmela ... i &apos;d get hosed financially .
there would be no reasoning with her after that .
and my nephew , it would kill him ...
after years of grooming him to be my number two .
and it would be very bad for the girl.she doesn &apos;t deserve that .
i mean , i &apos;m not stupid.i know part of it &apos;s this father @-@ figure thing ...
you know , on account of hers ran off .
it would be like committing an act of symbolic incest .
whatever .
look , what am i gonna do ?
i got lucky the first time , &apos; cause i was able to control myself ,
but you only get one of those .
rationalizing .
&quot; i can &apos;t control myself . &quot; you can.i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s different for women . it &apos;s all about up here with them .
she could make a play for you .
you might want to think about
how you &apos;re going to establish limits and boundaries .
for example , you could tell her she means a great deal to you ,
but you think of her as a daughter .
even if i want to fuck her brains out .
this is a milestone for you .
you &apos;re at a very important crossroads .
for once you want to avoid doing something you know is wrong
and would be destructive both to yourself
and to the people you care about .
that &apos;s growth.that &apos;s progress .
just tell me what i &apos;m supposed to do.you have to be honest with yourself .
i know this is a powerful urge ,
but if you can &apos;t keep it in your pants , you have to stay away from her .
you know ...
not long ago , you stood in my outer office .
i recall you used the words &quot; drop @-@ dead gorgeous &quot; about me
and how you had to have me .
i said i wouldn &apos;t date you , and look , you survived .
what a horrible fucking job you have.how do you do it ?
but what happens now is your choice .
act and create a bed of misery ,
or you can look at this as a chance to do something good .
you say she respects you.be worthy of respect .
see if you can remain a friend to this woman ,
a help to her .
you know , tony had ducks one time ... in his pool .
you need to find out where chris went.i &apos;m getting this vibe from him .
who ? tony ?
he &apos;s really nice . he listens .
he &apos;s kind of attractive ...
definitely an alpha male ...
but what if christopher found out ? what ?
i &apos;m not gonna fuck him.then , what are you talking about ?
i love christopher , and sooner or later we &apos;re gonna get out
from under all this shit and leave this fucking state .
jesus christ . she &apos;s a good @-@ looking woman ,
and she wants to fuck barney rubble ?
&quot; well , we really don &apos;t know him . he listens . &quot;
excuse me , is this seat taken ?
tony , hi .
hey . how you doing ?
well , why i &apos;m here , patsy &apos;s bringing somebody by ,
i &apos;m gonna need to use the office . - no problem .
i made a resolution .
i got to start spending a lot more time on the floor.crack the whip .
i &apos;m beat , tell you the truth .
i think i &apos;m gonna grab 40 winks till patsy gets here .
wait , you don &apos;t have chrissy &apos;s cell , do you ?
he called but he didn &apos;t leave a new number .
he &apos;ll probably try you again . he &apos;s due back tomorrow .
oh , excuse me.- i &apos;ll come back .
no , i &apos;m all right .
this mole back there looked irregular around the margins .
every time i see anything now , i think i got melanoma .
i can imagine .
hi , it &apos;s adriana at the crazy horse .
yeah , i need a car , please . just tell him to wait outside .
what , your car still ? yeah , they &apos;re replacing the alternator .
you want a belt ?
what i could really use is some ...
i wouldn &apos;t say no .
get me motivated to clean the house before christopher gets back ,
except i &apos;m all out .
it &apos;s 2 : 00 , cross @-@ eyed billy probably left the bing already .
i know a guy , andre , he &apos;s always up .
well , cancel the car , i &apos;ll give you a ride .
you know who thinks you &apos;re cute ...
is marlene .
she &apos;s got to be over 30 , isn &apos;t she ?
she &apos;s 31 .
you know who you ought to introduce me to is that friend a yours .
who ? the one you brought over to the house that time .
tall , kind of blondish , brownish hair ... danielle from whippany .
she &apos;s dead .
what ? yeah ,
she drowned on a picnic .
you know , i thought i picked up on something between her and me .
i &apos;m not trying to be conceited .
tony !
i &apos;ve reviewed your chart and ruled out internal injuries ,
so you &apos;re free to go .
i &apos;ll have the nurse process your discharge orders .
whoa , whoa . this was a very bad accident .
are you sure you did all the tests ?
i can afford it .
i did the appropriate tests .
i have a medical degree from johns hopkins .
my grandmother
was the first black woman licensed to practice medicine in delaware .
all right , take it easy .
the young lady that i was with , they said she was okay ,
but could i see her ?
ade .
they say you &apos;re gonna be fine , they just want to keep you here for observation .
you know , be on the safe side .
i don &apos;t even remember what happened .
there was a raccoon in the road , i swerved .
how &apos;s your car ?
escalade ?
it &apos;s totaled .
probably saved our life .
are you okay ?
yeah , they &apos;re gonna let me go .
i want to go too .
chrissy &apos;s coming home today .
we should probably talk about that .
right .
dude , how you doing ?
i hit the fucking mother @-@ lode.20
gs of product a week . little paulie &apos;s behind me
with the other half .
fuck me .
now , 20 % of this load , they can stamp the packs for the vending machines .
the rest , the cartons can go straight to the bodegas ,
let them worry about the stamps .
i &apos;m beat.i &apos;m gonna hit the fucking rack ,
have ade cook me up a nice carbonara .
what &apos;s the matter ? don &apos;t know how to tell you , but adriana &apos;s in the hospital .
she was in an accident .
what ? when ?
last night around 2 : 00 .
jesus christ , what happened ? is she all right ?
she got banged up , but she &apos;s gonna be okay .
the drinking and driving ... i told her ! - where is she ?
mount mercy in dover .
dover ? - apparently they swerved
to avoid a deer in the road .
they ?
her and tony .
tony ? soprano ?
uh @-@ huh .
is he all right ?
not a scratch . the fucking luck on this guy .
yeah .
oh , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , dover .
right , she &apos;s got an aunt she &apos;s close to out there who &apos;s been sick .
she &apos;s friends with tony &apos;s aunt .
all right , somebody take me to get my car.i better get over there .
fabio , put it up !
thought i &apos;d die in there without a cigarette .
what , so you &apos;re just not gonna talk ?
i almost got killed , christopher.i &apos;m just curious .
what the fuck were you doing in the middle of the night
in the middle of nowhere in a car with my uncle ?
he was driving me home .
fucking dover ?
we were talking .
w @-@ we were going to get something to eat .
i get off of work , i don &apos;t want to go right home .
you weren &apos;t even there.no , i was in a fucking ride @-@ a @-@ rent
busting my ass with a bunch of rednecks making a living ,
to buy you alcohol and coke
and all the other shit you shovel into your mouth !
2 : 00 in the fucking morning ? !
don &apos;t fucking lie to me ! i can &apos;t stand it ! nothing was going on , christopher !
i should &apos;ve made you walk home !
i swear to god.you know how this looks ?
don &apos;t talk to me ! shut your mouth !
you wanted to see me ?
is adriana okay ?
she &apos;s fine .
people who don &apos;t clean up after their pets ...
pop this in that basket for me , will you ?
it &apos;s blind luck , that accident .
cop told me he thought he was coming up on a fatality when he saw the car .
i would be thinking the same thing if i were you ,
but it &apos;s not true .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
her car was in the shop , i was driving her home from work , that &apos;s all .
we were looking to get a burger .
in dover.what difference does it make ?
you don &apos;t seem to give a shit she almost died .
she could &apos;ve been paralyzed or scarred up ,
and you got a puss on ?
what were you doing out there alone in a car with my fiancee ?
we were talking about you , you selfish prick ,
and how you &apos;re the best thing that ever happened to her .
oh , you don &apos;t think this fucking devastates me ?
well , frankly , you scored so far over your head when you got her ,
what do you expect ?
what the fuck are you talking about ? she &apos;s a knockout ,
a 100,
and look at you .
you &apos;re average at best ,
so you better reconcile yourself with that ,
or you &apos;re gonna be fucking paranoid your whole life .
oh , so this is my fucking fault now ?
nothing happened , and i &apos;m not gonna say it again !
and you should &apos;ve married that girl two years ago .
everybody knows you &apos;ve been the biggest fucking cooze hound
around the past four or five years .
your mid @-@ life crisis.you &apos;d fuck a catcher &apos;s mitt .
on everything i hold sacred ,
on my children ,
there &apos;s nothing going on between me and adriana .
tony walked away without a scratch ,
but adriana suffered a severe blow to the head .
adriana got caught giving the big guy a blowjob .
and when the paramedics found them , she had his cock still in her mouth .
now , statistics show that most single @-@ car fatalities
are the result of guys popping their load behind the wheel .
apparently , he came all over the sun visor .
sanseverino .
guess who went down on tony soprano .
that &apos;s the truth . it &apos;s fact .
if it was my old lady , the next thing she would suck
is a tailpipe . - that pretty little trim can suck this pipe anytime she wants .
like you would ever have a shot.hey , let me tell you something .
when christopher was in rehab , she was calling me all the time .
i was this close .
then you got a problem ,
&apos;cause your braciole isn &apos;t even that long .
what &apos;s so funny ? nothing .
didn &apos;t sound like nothing , i want to hear the big joke .
take it easy , we &apos;re just shooting the shit .
we were just talking about my braciole . oh yeah , what about it ?
so , deal you in , huh ? i asked him a fucking question .
what are you breaking my balls for ? i want a fucking answer .
what &apos;s so fucking hilarious , you fucking parade float ?
oh !

and larry down there said our little cousin was in there all fucked up .
somebody told him what was going on in the car .
there was nothing going on in the car.no ,
of course not , but he thinks there was ,
so he started drinking again , he beat up adriana
and he threw her out of the fucking house .
where &apos;s his fucking self @-@ control , this guy ?
little paulie &apos;s out there looking for him to rein him in ,
but he was saying some crazy things about you .
oh , this goddamn kid .
christopher &apos;s not right in the head , ton &apos; .

well , he knows where to find me .
you see him you tell him that .

look , relax . go whenever you want .
what the hell is wrong with him ?
what do you want , tony ? he couldn &apos;t bring this in himself ?
i can &apos;t even come in and say hello ?
what you want is to know if i heard the disgusting shit they &apos;re saying .
at least have the guts to come out and ask me .
it isn &apos;t true .
you know what ? fuck you !
fuck me ? fuck you !
you got to put your son in hiding because of your fucking philandering ?
afraid he &apos;ll get caught in the crossfire ? your own son ?
christopher &apos;s upset , that &apos;s all.he could come over
he could say some things - that a kid shouldn &apos;t hear
just please leave .
i don &apos;t even want to look at you .

the thought never even entered my head ! you &apos;re a man !
you &apos;re alone in a car with her ...

mister ... sorriano , what seems to be the matter ?
soprano.i &apos;m fine . it &apos;s my friend here who needs to talk to you .
you know where er admitting is ?
look , you got someplace maybe we could talk ?
it &apos;s 3 : 00 a.m. , and i just finished a 17 @-@ hour rotation .
any gunshot wounds or broken kneecaps ?
two minutes.you &apos;re an excellent doctor ,
that &apos;s why i brought him here.come on .
this gentleman here is the fiance of the young lady that i was with .
now , he &apos;s got it into his head
that there was oral sex going on at the time of the wreck .
listen , l ...
hey , hey , hey !
just a second .
naturally , he &apos;s very upset ,
so i need you to tell him there wasn &apos;t .
he &apos;s obviously feeling the pressure , he &apos;s just gonna fucking lie .
i &apos;m not in the custom of lying about anything ,
but whether somebody was getting something in the car ,
how could i possibly attest to that ?
well , as the attending , you could explain
how medically it &apos;s not possible
excuse me ? if she was wearing her seatbelt ,
then there would have been abrasions
if she was wearing her seatbelt , then there would have been abrasions
to the lateral anterior aspect of the clavicle , wouldn &apos;t there ?
or the right mid @-@ sternum ?
are you a physician ?
no , i &apos;m a pre @-@ board certified massage therapist .
so did she have any of those kind of things ?
actually , yes , on the right clavicle
and the sternum just above the xiphoid process
which would indicatean upright position at the moment of impact .
so what he &apos;s saying is that she was sitting up .
all right.thank you , doctor . come on .
for the kids , the make @-@ a @-@ wish foundation , whatever ... here .
thank you !
what do you want from me ?
i guess i believe you .
all right .
you threw food at vito . that &apos;s got to be resolved .
he was fucking laughing , which was wrong .
but at this point now , it don &apos;t make no difference .
even if it wasn &apos;t true , it &apos;s what people think .
they know you were out there scoring coke with her .
what do you care what people think ? you know the truth .
i got to live in the world .
and now i look like joe jerkoff .
no , no , no , no .
you know what ? i might as well have fucked her .
thanks .
i rang the doorbell six times.- nobody answered
what are you doing here ? i want to talk to you .
if you came to pick him up , he &apos;s not going.oh ,
so you believe all that shit they &apos;re saying , huh ?
am i that horrible ? really ?
where there &apos;s smoke , there &apos;s fire.i don &apos;t know what you did .
what &apos;s gonna happen when your children hear about this ?
meadow already suspects you .
suspects what ? she saw you at the club .
she said she thought you were coked out .
what are you talking about ? i don &apos;t do drugs .
she knows about the accident . what do you think she &apos;s gonna think ?
and with anthony at that age ?
oh , come on , the kids ! the kids ... it &apos;s about you ! fine , so it &apos;s all about me !
what , do i mean nothing to you ? !
that i got to live with this swirling around me ?
forget about what they &apos;re saying , i &apos;m asking you .
you think i &apos;d have sexual relations with her ?
adriana , who &apos;s gonna be a member of this family ? !
now i want you to answer me truthfully .
look , i know i haven &apos;t been a fucking saint , all right ?
and you got plenty of issues of your own on that subject .
but you haven &apos;t exactly been a fucking saint yourself .
no , no , no , no , no , come here .

thank you .
look , i &apos;m asking you to pull with me to put a good face on this thing .
for the sake of the kids and this family .
i got to bail you out ?
it &apos;s never @-@ ending , your bullshit .

jesus christ .
don &apos;t get all excited .
most of it &apos;s from the accident .

we &apos;d like your permission to put a listening device in your business .
this relationship with tony could net us a lot of chatter .
don &apos;t forget , it &apos;s him we &apos;re after.there is no relationship !
the faster we get tony and put him away ,
the sooner you can get on with your life .
we can get a court order to install a device anyway ,
but this will make our lives simpler .
fuck you.i do enough for you people .
you &apos;re not bugging my club.adriana ...
it &apos;s a syndrome , protecting abusers .
if it would &apos;ve been christopher alone in a car with a woman ,
i would &apos;ve killed him .
thank you .
arthur &apos;s sending something over with his compliments .

nice to see you , ton &apos; .
oh , thank you .

nice to see you .
i hope you have a pleasant evening .
