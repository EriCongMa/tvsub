Is this what you're looking for?
Ezra is taking on these big responsibilities.
And he needs a job.
The park rangers found a body.
It was Toby.
No, Spence, it wasn't.
Will you just tell me that what I saw tonight wasn't real?
Please tell me.
I'm here to pick up Malcolm.
Your friend picked me up instead.
She said her name was Alison.
They just found a body tonight.
Where?
Exactly where Spencer said it was.
I don't think that I can do this, anymore.
Look at all that's happened since you turned me down on
our little drive up the mountain.
You don't have to ask me again, Mona.
I'm in.
She knows we're down here, right?
Maybe she's just as nervous about seeing us as
we are about seeing her.
Guys, she's the exact same Spencer that we saw last week.
No, the Spencer we saw in Radley was not the Spencer I know.
That was before.
Em, we're not just here for her,
we're for you, too.
Do we talk about him?
Do we bring it up?
I don't want to say anything that could put her back there.
I know the cops said they found Toby.
But they sent that second body to the state coroner
for a reason.
I mean, maybe there's hope.
You know how I feel about hope.
Breeds eternal misery.
We lost Toby a long time ago.
We just didn't know it.
Oh, you've got to love the Hastings.
I just get released from a mental hospital,
and they welcome my friends with tea and crumpets.
What's the difference between a crumpet and an English muffin?
Hanna, does it matter?
I'm just making conversation.
An English muffin is a baked bread. It's made of dough.
And a crumpet is a griddle cake.
It's made of batter.
How are you, Spence?
I'm all right.
You know, you don't have to pretend to be okay for us.
Yeah, if this was the act you had to pull off to get out of there,
then...
Do you remember when you were in the light house, Emily?
And you had to make that choice?
It was either him or you?
I wasn't as strong as you were.
When I saw Toby in the woods,
like that, I just gave up.
So what changed?
You seem like you're back to yourself.
I decided I didn't want to be victim anymore.
That's not who I am.
Here.
What's this?
周五晚上八点
My parents told all of their friends that
I went to Radley for exhaustion,
so they want to throw
a soiree to make sure that everybody knows that I'm all better now.
Could really use some support.
Can you guys please come?
Of course.
Sure. Yeah, you know we'd do anything for you.
I'm counting on that.

We like your plan. You'll get your reward Friday.
Those bitches are finally going to get what they deserve.
第三季 第二十四集
Did Malcolm tell you what she looked like?
No, he just said she was a friend of mine,
and her name was Alison. That's all I know.
Well, look--you have to talk to him, find out more.
Yeah, like does she have dark hair, horns, and a tail?
Guys, no, we are not using Malcolm to get to Mona.
You know, the last time I saw Ezra
I could hardly face him.
All we have to do is show Mona's picture to the kid.
He'll confirm that Mona took him and the cops will
take our lulu head back to the nut farm.
Hanna.
Sorry, Spence. My bad.
I don't know, it seems like a really
bold move for Mona.
The risk being seen like that?
What are you saying, Spence?
It feels desperate.
Like maybe she's trying to get caught.
Okay, well, Malcolm is off limits, okay?
Gotta get to class.
I can use some extra money.
Did you not just hear Aria?
Em, kids love me. I'll make a game out of it.
Hey, Emily.
What-uh-what are you doing here?
Our coach arranged for us to practice here this morning.
But I say if it's water, it's wet, right?
A pool's a pool.
I don't think we've met.
Uh, Shana, this is Spencer.
Uh, you swim for Oakwood?
Amongst other things. Will you be at the meet?
Yeah. Wouldn't miss it.
I'll look for you. Good luck, Emily.
You, too.
I hate her.
Why?
Because she flirts with everyone but me.
Shana's bad news.
Wherever she goes, trouble follows.
Well, it was great seeing you.
Take care.
Hey.
Hey.
Did you have another interview?
Yeah, they called this morning.
Well, that's good.
Probably means that they're interested
in having you back.
I don't think it's going to work out for me.
Oh, I'm sorry.
You said you were going to make it all go away.
I'm worried that the police have evidence.
Look, I need to see you today.
I've got to go. Bye.
I just got off the phone with your mom.
Did you know that Ezra was applying for
a teaching job at rosewood high?
Yeah, he applied for a job subbing in the district.
Listen, your mom and I recognize that Ezra
needs to find a way to support his son.
But he cannot teach in
rosewood if you two are still seeing each other.
Your leaving us no choice--
Dad, slow down, okay. He's not getting the job.
He was offered the position this morning, Aria.
Ezra asked for the day to decide if he wants to take it.
So, Aria didn't tell me that you were interested in the job.
Oh, well, I didn't tell her because I didn't want
to feel pressured if you gave me the gig.
Thank you.
So, Malcolm's seven, right?
What's he into? Fast cars and fast girls?
It's a joke.
He's into trains.
Oh! Well, all aboard the Hanna express.
Um, do you have a resume, or anything?
Honestly, I haven't baby sat since I was 15.
But my mom's in New York, Caleb's out of town,
so, I have a lot of time to kill.
And I could use the extra money.
Okay. I have an appointment tonight,
So, if you're free,
we can give it a test run.
See if it's a good fit.
Well, it will be, promise.
I've missed you.
They'll all be together this Friday.
You know what you need to do.
Yeah. What did the doctor say about your eyes?
Um, I'll have good days and bad days.
Eventually they'll all be bad.
On your darkest days,
you know I'll be here for you.
Is everything okay?
Why didn't you tell me that they offered you the job?
'Cause I don't think I'm going to take it.
And I didn't think you
should share in the burden of that decision.
You need a job, Ezra.
But you know what would happen to us
if I end up back at rosewood.
Things are different now. People know about us.
Hey, don't--don't cry. Don't cry.
We're okay.
No, we're not.
Nothing about us feels right anymore.
I'm sorry.
It's not your fault.
I want to fix this.
I know.
I know, but you can't.
Okay, we've been chasing after what we used to have
ever since you found out about Malcolm, but...
I just don't--
I don't think that we can ever get that back.
Things aren't easy, but they can still be good.
It shouldn't be this hard.
If you're not happy anymore...
You know, that's what matters most to me.
Hey, I love you just as much as I always have.
And that's why I want you to take this job.
Aria, wait, wait.
I love you.
Evening, ma'am.
It's seat yourself, pretty eyes.
Hanna got the job.
I know.
Spencer.
When I was in Radley,
Mona told me that you were alive.
I wanted to believe her, but until now...
Back in the woods,
was that you?
Were you a part of it?
Mona told me after.
And you let me believe that you were dead?
Everything I've done, was so I could protect you.
I want to believe that.
Let me take you somewhere safe.
Does Mona know you're here?
No.
She told me you'd be there Friday.
That you'd be my reward for delivering the girls.
How'd you find me?
She left me alone in her lair.
I kidnapped a seven-year-old.
I'm the reason that Aria and Ezra broke up.
So, I've earned her trust.
It's not safe for you to be here.
I stopped worrying about me a long time ago.
What we had was real.
I've been pretending to work with Mona
so I could keep you safe.
I need you to believe me.
And I need you to follow me.
What happened to Rex?
Do you want to play a game?
Come on, it'll be fun.
My dad said I can watch cartoons.
Fine.
But you should know that watching tv rots your brain.
It's your choice if you want to grow up to be stupid.
Just sayin'.
Okay, let's play "Guess who."
I'll show you a picture of a person,
and you tell me if you know them.
Okay.
That's Aria.
See. You're good at this.
Okay.
Do you know her?
She didn't take you to the carnival?
I went with Aria's friend, Alison.
Is this Alison?
Nope.
What about this?
Nope.
What about this person?
That's a boy.
I am going to go call my friend really quick.
Can I play a game on your phone?
Sure.
I struck out.
He's seven. Maybe he's confused.
Hanna. I gotta call you back.
I don't understand, they have the tapes and that can't--
No, I do understand, but those bitches
are going to be at the lodge at nine.
Do you understand?
Yes, I do.
Shana is right.
I've told her, she didn't listen.
Doesn't look like anybody lives here.
I shuffle between a few motels.
Mona doesn't know about this one.
And red coat?
The only thing I know about red coat is that she's in charge.
I know.
You still don't trust me.
Look, I understand
why you've been helping Mona.
I made the same decision.
But if I saw you hurting,
the way that I know you saw me...
Toby.
No wonder I was a fat kid.
When my dad cheated on my mom and left us to start a new family,
I had a box of these a night.
But I would get some peanut butter
and that frosting in a can and have a party.
Alison's right here.
What?
She's in this picture.
I don't remember that.
It just popped up.
That can't be who you saw.
That's Aria's friend, Alison.
No, Malcolm, that girl's--
I remember her pretty hair.
That's her, Hanna. With the blue shirt.
Spencer?
That's Alison.
He said she was the girl in the blue shirt.
This is crazy.
And you're saying, that Shana knows Jenna.
And that the both of them are meeting up with Melissa?
This is crazier than crazy.
I mean, Radley's looking better every day.
I'm actually ready to check in.
We're going to figure it out.
I've already got it figured out.
Spencer's part of the A-team. Game over.
Today it's me and Ezra. Tomorrow it'll be you and Caleb.
And then it's going to be your turn Emily,
So get ready to say goodbye to Paige,
'cause I promise you, A's going to take her from you.
Why would Spencer do this to us?
Guys, I don't believe for one second
that Spencer's on the A-team.
Okay, if she is working with Mona
then there has to be more to the story.
We don't know what happened in Radley.
But spencer went in there at rock bottom.
And she came out like a shiny new penny.
Are you thinking shock treatment?
No. No, I'm saying that
Mona spent a lot of time in Radley.
And maybe she made some friends.
And maybe Spencer talked to some of those friends.
Mona asked Spencer to join the A-team
on the night of the masquerade ball.
Did Spencer finally take her up on it?
Yeah, but why now?
There's a way to prove
That Spencer's still with us,
And if Mona's watching,
it won't put Spencer at risk.
Really, Hanna? You're in the mood for a dance party?
Look, A was everywhere
before Spencer joined the A-team.
Do you really think we're meeting in secret?
Aria.
I took the job.
You remember what you said at Ali's funeral?
You were right. There never was a happy ending for us.
You know, this doesn't have to be forever.
You're graduating in seven months.
And I wish that I could hold onto that.
But, it's too hard.
I need to move on, and so do you.
Bye, ezra.
The Red Devil is gonna win and here they come.
Here comes the Shark, close behind.
And what a win for the Red Devils!
What is this?
You followed me here, that means you don't
know who she is, either.
And if you don't know who she is,
that means you're still one of us.
Look, Spence, whatever it is,
no matter how deep you're into this,
you know that you can tell us the truth, right?
We want to help you.
Mona came to see me at Radley.
And when I found Toby in the woods,
she'd planned the whole thing.
She wanted to break me so that she could
put me back together. Like her own Humpty Dumpty.
So, Mona made you an offer you couldn't refuse?
She told me that Toby was still alive.
Toby's alive?
And it's true.
It's true, he's been working with Mona because
he found out about red coat
and Mona's the only person who knows who she is.
And you've seen him?
Yeah.
Last night.
He's on our side. You guys, he always was.
But this party tomorrow, it's a set-up.
Red coat just wants us all to be together.
Why? What's she gonna do to us?
I don't know.
But we're not going to let it happen.
Okay, whatever it is, we're one step ahead of her,
finally, and there are two of us on the inside.
And when were you going to clue us in on
your double agent status, Nikita?
I'm the one who sent you the picture of me and Ali.
And you did exactly what I needed you to do.
Because Mona watches my every move.
You've found a way to get to me without her knowing about it.
So, instead of red coat waiting for us tomorrow,
we'll be waiting for her.
And if we're lucky, this will all be over with.
Luck won't have anything to do with it.
All right, good morning.
My name is Mister Fitz.
And I'm back as your substitute teacher.
Uh, if we open up to Chapter One,
we'll find out why Hemingway said,
"All things truly wicked, start from innocence."
It's perfect timing, actually.
I need a pick-me-up.
That place is really nice.
It's the Hastings. Were you expecting "Donuts and dogs"?
How can you afford new Miu Mius?
Oh! I borrowed them.
The store gives full refunds for returns.
That's if you don't wear them.
Doesn't say that on the receipt.
They're running late.
How late?
They're on their way. That's all I know.
She's expecting all of you to be here.
And we will be.
You have no idea what she's capable of, Spencer.
Trust me. You don't want to disappoint her.
I saw them getting ready.
And I have the video you asked for.
They don't suspect anything.
You guys, I'm serious about not
taking back those shoes.
Hanna, quiet!
We've got to get inside before red coat shows up.
If she knows we're onto her,
we'll never find out who she is.
Are we sure we trust Toby?
Spencer does.
Do we have a choice?
It's all according to plan.
How far away are you?
It's safe for you to land.
It's finally about to end.
You're getting what you've always wanted.
She doesn't know the others aren't here yet.
I told you, they're coming.
Why don't we for a walk while we wait?
I'll take care of Spencer.
Toby?
I know how you feel, Spencer.
It sucks to be lied to.
Get up.
I believed you.
I said get up!
You won't get away with this.
I'd say "Watch me," but you won't be here to see it.
If something goes wrong,
you know what you need to do.
Going somewhere?
You're making a terrible mistake.
That's not how we see it.
Because you don't see.
You have know idea what's going on here.
We know enough.
Who is that?
Get to the plane.
Wait, Toby!
Be careful.
Remember why we're here, Spencer.
You see her. She doesn't see you.
What have you done?
Mona, try your phone.
Nothing.
How can you not have a signal? We saw you make a call.
It's her. Don't you get it?
She can do anything.
She's everywhere and she's nowhere.
Come on, let's get out of here.
It's locked!
We're gonna die. We're all going to burn.
Shut up, Mona!
I'm never going to know who she was.
What did you just say?
Red coat.
I don't know who she is either.
Are you kidding?
You guys, we have to get out of here.
Ali?
Did anyone see her?
See who?
Alison. She pulled me out of there.
She pulled us all out.
No, you're hallucinating.
She was here. I swear it.
Ali's dead.
I saw her, too.
So did I.
Ali is red coat.
So all of this started when you were at Radley?
I made a deal with the devil.
And she gave me a way in and out of that place.
At first it was fun, having a partner.
But then the game changed.
She stole you from me.
So what happened that night?
Were you there at the cemetery?
Did you drug me? Did you take Ali's body?
I don't know who drugged you.
But I was at the cemetery and so was red coat.
How could you not see who it was?
She was wearing a mask.
She looked just like Ali.
That's probably what happened tonight.
It wasn't Ali. It was a mask.
Guys?
Wait, is that?
Somebody pulled it out of the lake.
Think this through, Ashley.
How do you live with yourself?
Hey, we're not done here!
We have to get this out of here.
Wait! There's more.
It's Jenna.
And Shana?
They know Wilden?
Guys.
Look at the trunk.
You're mine now.
Kisses.
A.
