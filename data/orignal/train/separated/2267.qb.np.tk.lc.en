第十六集
regina &apos;s doing what ?
she &apos;s going undercover .
they &apos;re after the author , too .
they feel the only way to get their happy ending
is to destroy yours .
may i come in ?
no amount of torture will work on him .
but it will succeed on the man he used to be .
i know there &apos;s something about your past with ursula
you &apos;re not telling me .
did you break her heart ?
worse .
mr. smee , we are to return to neverland with a full hold --
not full bellies .
come on , captain .
pan will never notice if a few cakes are missing .
you can eat as many cakes as you want
after i find a way to destroy the dark one .
until then , we keep pan happy .
of course .
do you hear that ?
it &apos;s beautiful .
rocks dead ahead !
that voice , captain -- what was it ?
the most dangerous creature in all the seas --
a mermaid .
why did you let that ship go ?
i &apos;m sorry , father , but i couldn &apos;t .
but i told you to .
and i &apos;m -- - poseidon , king of the sea .
yes , yes . i know , but still ...
... i want to use my voice to make people happy ,
not to hurt them .
that &apos;s what your mother wanted ,
and look what happened to her .
i miss her , too , father .
but she &apos;s the one that taught me to sing ,
and i know she wouldn &apos;t want me to use my voice like this .
she also wouldn &apos;t want you to let her murderers sail free .
she would want you to avenge her death .
no ! that &apos;s what you want !
just because one human hurt mother
doesn &apos;t mean they &apos;re all bad .
enough !
as long as you live in my ocean , you will live by my rules .
then maybe i don &apos;t want to live in your ocean .
ursula , pout all you want ,
but i expect you home by high tide .
darling . come .
you &apos;re missing out on all the fun .
i already told you --
i don &apos;t know anything about this author .
well , perhaps you could use a little incentive .
oh , that knife is not gonna make me remember something
that i don &apos;t know .
wait .
is there a problem ?
i knew she didn &apos;t have the stomach for this .
please .
i was torturing people
back when you were still playing with puppies .
this sorry excuse for a man used to be made of wood .
so let &apos;s light a fire under him and see what happens .
okay . all right .
you know something ? i actually , uh ,
do remember something about the author .
don &apos;t hold out on us .
w @-@ when i was in hong kong , uh , before the curse broke ,
i met a mystic .
his name was the dragon .
i don &apos;t know how he knew about the book ,
but he had been looking for the author for years .
and what did this &quot; dragon &quot; learn ?
he died before i could ask .
oh , well , that &apos;s something you two are about to have in common .
and after he died ... i took his research .
and i brought it with me to storybrooke .
do you really think this man @-@ child
is telling us the truth ?
well , it wouldn &apos;t be the first time he &apos;s lied to my face .
i &apos;m afraid i &apos;m gonna have to
pay a visit to his trailer to find out .
while you &apos;re doing that ,
shall we carry on with the rest of the plan ?
rest of the plan ?
what aren &apos;t you telling me ?
you &apos;re gonna have to do a lot more than just kidnap a marionette
and torch a few logs for us to tell you everything .
in the meantime ,
be content that you &apos;ve finally chosen the winning side .
it &apos;s okay , emma .
as long as he &apos;s with regina , pinocchio will be all right .
we don &apos;t know that .
i just wish i hadn &apos;t let her ditch me .
swan , you couldn &apos;t have known
that she &apos;d drop that tracking device .
yeah , but i let her talk me into thinking
kidnapping him was a good idea .
if anything happens to that kid , it &apos;s my fault .
uh , the tracks end here .
looks like the rain washed them away .
oh , would now be an appropriate time for a locator spell ?
we may not need one .
look .
mary margaret .
what the hell was that ? are you okay ?
i have to make this quick .
we don &apos;t have much time .
regina ?
pinocchio &apos;s fine .
he &apos;s back to his old self , or older self .
august .
but there &apos;s something else you need to know --
gold is here .
we &apos;re holed up in his cabin , now --
and he &apos;s in town for more than just the author .
but he won &apos;t tell me why ,
which means whatever it is he &apos;s planning -- it &apos;s bad .
so the dark one &apos;s returned .
yeah .
there &apos;s only one person who can help us drive him back out .
h @-@ h @-@ he &apos;s here ?
th @-@ that &apos;s -- that &apos;s impossible .
well , did you really think he &apos;d stay away ?
the dagger -- you need to hand it over
so we can stop this fight before it starts .
the dagger ? i @-@ i don &apos;t have the dagger .
killian does .
who ? me ?
well , i haven &apos;t seen that cursed blade
since you commanded the crocodile to leave the first time .
but y @-@ you took it from me last night
to hide it where no one could find it .
after the lifetimes i spent searching
for a way to destroy the dark one ,
i &apos;m pretty certain i &apos;d remember holding that dagger in my hand .
okay , well , if i didn &apos;t give it to you , then who --
you gave it to gold ... disguised as you .
he &apos;s back , and so is his power .
even when i didn &apos;t think he could deceive me anymore ...
he found a way .
banishment was too good for that demon .
we should have driven that dagger through his heart
when we had the chance .
then your name would be written across it .
it &apos;s a small price to pay
to ensure the crocodile wouldn &apos;t come back again .
i know you &apos;re angry ,
but we defeated him before and we &apos;ll do it again .
yeah , but the question is , how ?
we don &apos;t even know what he &apos;s planning .
first , we save august .
yeah . you do that .
i &apos;ll find out the dark one &apos;s secret .
how are you gonna do that ?
the sea witch -- ursula .
remember when i said i had a past with her ?
now &apos;s the time to use it .
how ?
by taking a page out of your book , swan .
i &apos;m gonna return her happy ending .
can you really do that ?
aye .
because i &apos;m the one who took it from her in the first place .
what &apos;s that -- more kindling ?
this page appeared to someone very important to me .
robin hood ?
how do you know about robin hood ?
just &apos; cause the boy doesn &apos;t remember being me
doesn &apos;t mean i don &apos;t remember being the boy .
well , you &apos;re right .
robin did find it .
but this page ...
it depicts something that didn &apos;t happen .
and i think you know more than you &apos;re saying .
what &apos;s the matter , darling ?
is there something out there ?
it &apos;s nothing .
just gonna go stretch my tentacles .
where is that infernal creature ?
right here , captain .
wait . i want to offer you a deal .
after what you did to me ? i don &apos;t think so .
gold was wrong .
you don &apos;t have to find the author to get what you want .
and why should i believe a word you say ?
because i know what it is you desire .
and i know exactly where to get it .
you still have it ?
the dark one --
he &apos;s here for more than just the author .
if i return your happy ending ,
you &apos;re gonna tell me exactly what he &apos;s doing in storybrooke .
you got yourself a deal .
* i &apos;ll tell you a tale of the bottomless blue *
* and it &apos;s hey , to the starboard , heave ho *
* look out , lad , a mermaid be waiting for you *
* in mysterious fathoms below *
* mysterious fathoms below *
i &apos;d recognize that voice anywhere .
you &apos;re the mermaid who nearly sank my ship .
but you didn &apos;t .
for that , i owe you a drink .
after i let you escape , my father said
i had to obey his rules if i wanted to live in his ocean .
i see you don &apos;t take well to ultimatums .
i broke into his vault and stole this .
it lets me walk on land .
well , you &apos;re a brave lass .
my father wasn &apos;t always so cruel , you know .
he used to be happy .
listening to my mother and me sing used to bring him joy .
what changed , love ?
my mother was killed ...
by a pirate .
that &apos;s why he forbade me to sing ,
except to guide sailors to their doom .
he turned my voice into a weapon .
but it &apos;s all i have left of my mother .
singing is the only way to keep her spirit alive .
you have a rare gift .
your voice can soothe even the most haunted soul .
you really think so ?
for almost a century ,
my every waking moment
has been consumed by one thought --
making an evil man pay
for what he did to the woman i loved .
listening to your voice ...
... took away that pain .
if even just for a brief moment .
that &apos;s all i ever wanted -- to make people happy .
well , that &apos;s what you &apos;re doing .
so , why are you singing in this rat &apos;s nest ?
i &apos;m saving for passage to glowerhaven .
my mother said it was her favorite place to sing .
i &apos;m trying to earn enough gold --
oh , you don &apos;t need gold for that trip .
i won &apos;t ?
not if i take you .
you &apos;d really do that for me ?
meet me at the docks tomorrow morning .
so , where exactly did you bury my treasure ?
oh , i didn &apos;t bury what you &apos;re after . it &apos;s aboard the jolly roger .
so where &apos;s the jolly roger ?
back in the enchanted forest .
now , can you still open portals underwater ,
or did you give up that power
when you became the monster you are ?
the monster that you made me .
can you open the portal or not ?
yes , i can .
but i &apos;m afraid i &apos;ll need something from the jolly roger
to know exactly where it is .
piece of the rigging .
did you really think i &apos;d trade my ship
without taking a souvenir ?
what &apos;s the matter -- you don &apos;t like the ocean ?
i haven &apos;t dipped my toe in the sea
since i was banished to this world .
stand back .
it didn &apos;t work .
yes , it did .
bloody hell .
looks like you &apos;re not the only thing that &apos;s changed .
the last man who tailed me ended up with a dagger in his gut .
you dare drag me onto my own ship ?
you &apos;re a dead man .
you listen to me .
my daughter is not going anywhere near this vessel tomorrow .
well , threatening me isn &apos;t gonna make her change her mind .
i don &apos;t need to change her mind .
you do .
how &apos;s a seashell gonna help me ?
it &apos;s now enchanted to take away her reason to leave --
her voice .
or rather , her singing voice .
if she can &apos;t sing , she &apos;ll return to the sea , where she belongs .
she told me what that voice means to her .
i won &apos;t betray her , not since she spared my ship .
what if i could offer you a way to destroy the dark one ?
what do you know about my feud with the crocodile ?
i know you &apos;ve spent a lifetime searching for a way to kill him .
i can offer you magic that will finally set you free .
what kind of magic do you mean ?
squid ink .
a single drop is potent enough to paralyze any being ,
even rumplestiltskin .
and all i have to do
is steal your daughter &apos;s singing voice ?
it &apos;s simple , pirate .
just show her how awful humans really can be .
do hope we &apos;re not interrupting ,
but we need the thief &apos;s assistance .
and how do i know that you &apos;re really killian ?
oh , now you decide to question my identity ?
if he were the dark one ,
lover boy here would already be dead .
yeah , she &apos;s got a point there .
but why should i help you ?
because for once , we want the same thing --
the dark one gone .
the key to making that happen is in here .
right .
that your ship , is it ?
bit small , isn &apos;t it ?
careful , mate .
it &apos;s unwise to insult the size of a pirate &apos;s ship .
and you spent more time in wonderland than anyone i know .
you must have something that can restore it .
you &apos;re in luck .
i think i might have just what you need .
regina !
robin ?
regina !
robin !
i don &apos;t understand .
how did you get here ?
that doesn &apos;t matter .
the only thing that matters is i &apos;m here with you now .
someone &apos;s watching .
what the hell are you doing here ?
get away from him !
if you &apos;re having trouble sleeping ,
i have something that might help .
i &apos;m fine . thank you .
hello , dearies .
tell us -- did you find anything at the puppet &apos;s trailer ?
of course not .
i didn &apos;t even look .
the man &apos;s a born liar .
he never would have cracked so easily .
instead , i paid a visit to the fairies .
or rather , a visit to their ample supply of magic .
now , this potion can temporarily reverse
any spell those do @-@ gooders cast .
they made him real .
this can undo that .
i promise you , deary -- this is gonna hurt .
now ...
let &apos;s see if we can pull this puppet &apos;s strings .
gold &apos;s cabin &apos;s up ahead . we go on foot from here .
anything from hook ?
think he &apos;s managed to turn ursula yet ?
if she hasn &apos;t turned him .
really ? we &apos;re thinking that now ?
well , he kind of went to a dark place this morning .
do you blame him ? if gold did to me what he did to hook ,
i &apos;d want to shove that dagger through his heart , too .
emma , that &apos;s not you . you &apos;re not --
it &apos;s also not hook . relax .
i &apos;m just saying i understood where he was coming from .
come on .
gold might not hurt a kid , but august ?
who knows what he &apos;ll do to him ?
when you said it was temporary ,
you weren &apos;t kidding , were you , darling ?
you see , you may no longer look like the puppet you once were ,
but it matters not .
that potion you just drank
has activated that built @-@ in lie detector of yours .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
excellent .
the next lie is gonna hurt .
what do you know about the author ?
i already told you everything .
try again , deary .
where is he ?
i don &apos;t know .
do not fool yourself .
i will get my answer .
okay .
where is he ?
all right .
i &apos;m gonna tell you what you want to know .
the sorcerer , uh , trapped the author behind a door .
the sorcerer ? a door ?
he &apos;s speaking in riddles .
no , listen to me , gold .
you know about the sorcerer .
you know i &apos;m telling the truth .
and she -- she knows about the door .
i know my papa gave you my things .
there was a page that i took out of the book .
had an illustration of the door on it .
regina ?
they were just scraps of paper .
then you &apos;ll have no problem sharing them with us now .
well , i would if i hadn &apos;t already given them to henry .
do you remember what the door looks like ?
made of wood .
hand @-@ carved frame . gilt in gold .
where is the door ?
all i know ... is ...
... it &apos;s somewhere in storybrooke .
there we are , now .
that wasn &apos;t so hard , now , was it ?
since the sorcerer was the one who did the trapping ,
we will start our search for the door at his mansion .
maleficent .
i &apos;ll stay here and watch the puppet .
no , no .
cruella will be our guard dog .
since you &apos;re the only one who &apos;s seen the drawing of the door ,
you &apos;re gonna have to help us find it .
be careful , love .
that &apos;s distilled from wonderland &apos;s finest mushrooms .
spill one drop , and , well ,
storybrooke will have a giant squid in its harbor .
now that &apos;s a ship fit for a pirate .
mr. smee , clear the deck .
* below *
* and that &apos;s wayward western winds blow *
i &apos;d like a moment alone with our guest .
* poseidon is king and his merpeople sing *
* in mysterious fathoms below *
* mysterious fathoms *
i hope you don &apos;t mind .
i thought your crew might like something to work by .
aye . it &apos;s beautiful .
i &apos;m afraid i &apos;ve got something to show you .
i know what that is . why do you have that ?
please don &apos;t use it !
don &apos;t worry .
i won &apos;t .
but you must know -- your father gave this to me .
he thought you &apos;d return home if you could no longer sing .
in exchange for helping him , he offered me squid ink --
a weapon that would finally let me get my revenge
against the dark one .
and you would sacrifice that prize for me ?
i know that voice
is the only thing you have left of your mother .
if i had something left of my love ...
look , i may be a pirate ...
... but i have a code .
and i promise to never take that voice from you .
but that means you &apos;ll remain trapped as pan &apos;s servant forever .
not necessarily .
you stole that bracelet from your father &apos;s vault .
i &apos;d wager that &apos;s where he keeps the squid ink .
you want me to steal it for you .
i &apos;ll take you to glowerhaven and wherever else you want to go .
then we can both get what we want .
aye .
now you &apos;re thinking like a pirate .
i never thought i &apos;d walk this sweet vessel again .
yes , well , you can ogle your ship
after you return my singing voice .
now , you know the deal -- i hand this over ,
you tell me every detail of the dark one &apos;s plan .
oh , you hear that ?
aye .
it didn &apos;t work .
why the devil not ?
because you &apos;re wrong , hook .
villains can &apos;t get their happy endings .
i never should have believed you
when you said we could do this without the author .
i delivered your voice .
it &apos;s not my fault if your magic can &apos;t get it
out of the bloody shell .
now tell me what gold has planned .
our deal is over . you get nothing !
our deal is not done .
i have to stop the dark one .
he &apos;s taken too much from me already .
you haven &apos;t changed one bit .
still the same selfish pirate , as always .
never go up against a woman with eight hands ,
especially when you only have one .
have a nice swim , captain .
don &apos;t worry .
you can thank me later .
are you okay ?
aye .
good .
that &apos;s for tossing black beard overboard
before he could tell me where eric was .
i had to rescue that awful man to find him .
then why are you here ?
i thought you and your prince were living happily ever after .
i was , until i got trapped in that bottle .
after you traded the jolly roger to black beard ,
he used your ship to terrorize a lot of people ,
including some royals from arendelle .
the queen trapped your ship as punishment .
elsa did that ?
and i accidentally got swept up in the magic ,
so thanks for letting me out .
was that the real ursula ?
why was she throwing you overboard ?
because i was so focused on getting what i want ,
i made a promise to her i couldn &apos;t deliver .
maybe she was right .
maybe villains can &apos;t get their happy endings .
maybe that &apos;s because villains
always go about getting them the wrong way .
i &apos;m gonna need your help .
i trust that you didn &apos;t run into any trouble .
nothing i couldn &apos;t handle .
i &apos;ve waited a century for this .
i couldn &apos;t have done this without your help , ursula .
so , tell me , where do you want to go to first ?
you &apos;re not taking her anywhere .
stand down , men .
this is between me and the sea king .
no ! it &apos;s about me .
hook told me what you asked him to do .
you were trying to take away
the only thing i have left of mother .
so i wouldn &apos;t lose you the way i lost her .
you may have fooled my daughter ,
but i know exactly what you are .
you only care about one thing -- your vengeance .
now you &apos;ll never get it .
you have no idea what you &apos;ve just done .
you dare attack a deity ?
i don &apos;t have to kill you to make you suffer .
i know i &apos;m not the only one consumed by vengeance .
no !
now you &apos;ll never sink another ship with this .
how could you ?
you said you had a code .
you said you &apos;d never steal my voice .
that was before your father
destroyed my one chance at revenge .
my father is a tyrant , but you &apos;re no better .
keep it .
if this is what humans are like , no one deserves to hear it .
ursula !
give me the shell .
and give you the satisfaction of returning it to her ?
now go .
before i destroy it and everything you hold dear .
thank heavens that potion was only temporary .
the scruff is so much more attractive than the timber .
i &apos;m here for my friend .
so , the savior found us , did she ?
now leave .
nice one , mom .
well , first thing you learn as a bandit --
back door &apos;s usually unlocked .
august , are you okay ?
did they hurt you ?
i &apos;ll survive .
well , i see somebody &apos;s been practicing .
well , i seem to remember someone
telling me i just needed to believe in myself .
i always knew you &apos;d figure it out .
it &apos;s good to have you back ,
even if it isn &apos;t the way things were supposed to be .
i &apos;m glad i didn &apos;t have to wait 20 years to see you as you again .
me too .
come on . let &apos;s get you out of here .
no one is going anywhere .
where the hell is hook ? what &apos;d you do to him ?
sorry , sweetheart .
your boyfriend is shark bait .
drop those hands ,
or your mother here &apos;s gonna need gills to breathe .
i &apos;m sorry , ursula .
but i had to .
don &apos;t you understand ?
my singing was the only thing keeping mother &apos;s spirit alive ,
and now she &apos;s gone forever .
you wanted me to choose a side .
well , father , i &apos;m choosing one -- mine !
ursula , don &apos;t !
all you ever wanted
was for me to remain your precious , little mermaid .
well , i &apos;m not gonna be that anymore .
in fact , i &apos;m not gonna be a mermaid at all .
you named me ursula after the sea goddess of old .
legend says she was strong and powerful .
well , that &apos;s exactly what i want to be .
ursula , wait !
now i &apos;m even more powerful than you .
and the whole sea will be at the mercy of my every whim .
you don &apos;t need to protect me , father .
you need to fear me .
ursula , you don &apos;t need to do this .
that &apos;s where you &apos;re wrong .
i can &apos;t have him leave with you .
not when the author is the only one
who can give me what i want .
that &apos;s not true .
how are you still breathing ?
i &apos;m good at surviving . or you &apos;re bad at killing .
either way , you don &apos;t need the author to get what you want .
i know why you couldn &apos;t release your voice from that shell .
only the one who enchanted it can do that .
wait .
you don &apos;t mean ...
aye .
father ?
ursula .
how are you here -- in this land ?
a young mermaid found me and brought me through a portal .
i need to say something .
i &apos;m sorry , ursula .
i never should have forced you to use your voice as a weapon .
it was just ... every time i heard you sing ,
i heard your mother , and it was too painful .
i let that pain fuel my desire for vengeance ,
but it shouldn &apos;t have .
it should have reminded me that i still had a piece of her --
you .
let me return your voice
so i can hear it one last time .
now that you are whole again , i &apos;ll leave you in peace .
wait .
my voice is all we have left of mother .
you took it from me once .
i don &apos;t want to do the same thing to you .
what are you saying ?
i &apos;ve missed you .
i &apos;ve missed you , too .
where &apos;s cruella ?
uh , she must have slipped away , most likely to warn gold .
we should clear out before they get back .
are you okay ?
hook , what &apos;s wrong ?
you gave ursula everything she wanted .
but i almost didn &apos;t , love .
i was so desperate to figure out what the crocodile was up to ,
i almost became the man i used to be .
you have no idea how easy it is to fall back into the darkness .
whatever mistakes you made with ursula , you fixed .
aye .
but it &apos;s a stark reminder of something .
what ?
with all this talk of authors and the book ,
we &apos;ve never discussed one fact ...
i was a villain .
but you &apos;re not anymore .
neither is regina , but she still lost her happy ending .
if we &apos;re to believe the rules of the book ,
then it &apos;s only a matter of time before i lose mine .
wait . if you &apos;re afraid of losing your happy ending ,
that means you found it .
what is it ?
don &apos;t you know , emma ?
it &apos;s you .
well , that was a royal waste of time .
the door may not be in the sorcerer &apos;s mansion ,
but it &apos;s somewhere in storybrooke .
we will find it .
what are you doing here ?
where &apos;s august ?
they rescued him -- the heroes .
you had one simple task .
it wasn &apos;t my fault ! we have a mole .
who would be foolish enough to cross us ?
i know exactly who .
ursula .
she sold us out for a reunion with daddy dearest .
all right .
we may have lost our informant ,
but we still have his information .
bring us the illustration of the door .
maybe there &apos;s something in it the puppet missed .
i suppose this is farewell .
it is , but first , i have to hold up my end of the deal .
gold &apos;s plan -- i &apos;m afraid it involves emma .
she &apos;s the only way he can secure happy endings for the villains .
well , i thought he was gonna get the author
to rewrite everyone &apos;s stories .
it &apos;s not that simple .
the author can &apos;t just change things in this world
because he didn &apos;t give everyone their happy endings here .
emma did .
she &apos;s the savior .
and as long as there &apos;s a savior ,
the author can &apos;t give the villains what they really want .
and the dark one knows this .
the dark one &apos;s gonna try to kill emma ?
worse --
he plans to fill her heart with darkness forever .
we &apos;re lucky he &apos;s okay .
it wasn &apos;t luck .
you got us that message . thank you .
i need your help with something .
what is it ?
i had a dream today -- robin hood came back ,
we were finally together , but then , i --
the evil queen --
showed up with a fireball in her hand .
i may not be archie , but it sounds like
you &apos;re afraid of the villain you used to be
and the one you might become again .
no , i don &apos;t think that &apos;s it .
in my dream ,
i don &apos;t think the evil queen was there to hurt robin .
i think she was there to protect him .
from what ?
i don &apos;t know .
i just ... felt it .
you used to track people for a living .
can -- can you get me a phone number ,
a way to contact him , anything ?
yeah .
yeah , i can do that .
mom !
what is she doing here ?
oh , it &apos;s okay . i promise .
august ... we need to talk about
how i &apos;m going to keep up my cover with gold .
the only reason i was able to come here ...
... is because they think i &apos;m stealing this page .
we didn &apos;t find the door at the sorcerer &apos;s mansion .
that &apos;s because it &apos;s not there .
what ?
but ... you said you didn &apos;t know where it was .

my nose didn &apos;t grow because i wasn &apos;t lying .
when gold asked me , i didn &apos;t know where the door was
because i didn &apos;t know where henry was keeping this page .

this isn &apos;t just an illustration .
this is the door .
