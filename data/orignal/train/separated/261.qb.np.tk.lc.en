wow ! bummer , dude .
you have a time machine ?
and somehow , it got programmed to this crap diner ?
i must admit , i am quite taken with steampunk .
对工业革命早期科技着迷 并虚构出蒸汽力至上的世界
oh , steampunk , right . i remember that trend .
it happened for , like , ten seconds
back in 2000 and @-@ are @-@ you @-@ kidding @-@ me ?
dude , seriously , you &apos;re sitting in a public place
tap @-@ tap @-@ tapping on an oldie typewriter ?
what are you ?
in the league of extraordinarily pretentious gentlemen ?
aren &apos;t you being a little aggressive ?
yup .
that &apos;s how people are here in the present where we live .
but don &apos;t get me wrong .
i &apos;d like to go back in time , too .
maybe stop 9 / 11 or that creep who had sex on my shoe ,
but i can &apos;t .
present ? where &apos;s that uniform from ?
from like , 1998 ?
oh , stop , or i &apos;m going to have
to shoot you with a smith &amp; wesson
以制作左轮手枪闻名
i &apos;m currently packing in my bloomers .
i &apos;ll go get thee a menu , my good man .
attention , everyone .
max and i have a little late @-@ night treat for you .
don &apos;t say it all excited like that .
now when it &apos;s not drugs , earl &apos;s going to be pissed .
you are invited to a very important taste @-@ test
of max &apos;s homemade cupcakes .
okay , but i will have only one .
when i get a tummy , single ladies call me buddha
and rub me for luck .
i gotta watch out , too .
last time i had max &apos;s chocolate espresso cupcake
just before going home ,
i was awake till 5 : 00 a.m. ,
hand washing all my thongs .
thongs ? earl , you devil .
that &apos;s right , just because there &apos;s snow on the roof
doesn &apos;t mean there &apos;s not swing in the sling .
oh , caroline , darling . can you go back over there ?
i forgot my racing form .
oh , horse racing ? it reminds me of chestnut .
max ... chestnut .
what &apos;s with the sad face ?
your horse is living it up at a fancy stable nearby .
not gone to the great stud farm in the sky .
did someone say &quot; stud farm &quot; ?
my fee is $ 10 a quart or $ 15 if you want a boy .
wow .
you bounced back from your sophie breakup pretty quick .
it was not a real breakup .
i will have her very soon again .
right now , i lay low and wait in bushes
like determined jungle cat .
or a rapist .
racing forms , here you go .
earl , maybe some time
you will take me out to the track with you .
i used to ride horses all the time in korea .
the mechanical ones for a quarter
in front of supermarkets ?
actually , max , i &apos;m a very good rider .
in fact , i was training to be a jockey
but was too short .
too short to be a jockey ?
通常只选身高矮小的男子
that &apos;s a hard hit , my man .
han , i had no idea you loved horses , too .
why didn &apos;t you ever say anything ?
well , why didn &apos;t you ever ask about any of my interests ?
i &apos;ll tell you why .
because all you ever talk about is
&quot; our cupcake business , our cupcake business . &quot;
doesn &apos;t your cd have other tracks ?
anyway , our cupcake business
has a very important meeting tomorrow
with paul platt , the party planner .
i know a party planner , too .
he sells j.lo. and salma hayek pinatas
off back of truck for cinco de mayo .
awesome . put me down for a hayek .
more storage space for candy .
well , our party planner is the it guy in manhattan .
and tomorrow , max and i are doing
a tasting for him at his office .
how can someone be too short to be a jockey ?
isn &apos;t that the whole point ?
are you all right , max ?
i got here as fast as i could .
caroline texted me to hurry over
because you didn &apos;t know you were pregnant ,
and you were giving birth over toilet .
so i grabbed my plunger and ran !
that is insane . i never texted that .
no , i did , when i stole your phone .
i needed a reason to get sophie over here .
i can &apos;t believe she believed it .
oh , come on , max . giving birth over toilet ?
that is very you .
now that you are here , sophie , sit .
i want to tell you something important .
well , you can forget that .
there &apos;s no way i &apos;m going to stay .
a cupcake party ?
oh , look , and this one even has a pretzel in it .
yup , that &apos;s our &quot; salty n &apos; spice &quot;
for our more adventurous customers .
also for the uptight white people ,
we have the very , very vanilla
which is ... big surprise ... my favorite .
and this is our beer @-@ batter maple bacon
spring break cupcake .
that &apos;s for stoners , and big surprise , my favorite .
we can only take four flavors
to represent our cupcake business .
see ? not one word ever about anyone else .
i have a pet ferret , if anyone gives a damn .
well , i have some big news
i want to share with you all as well .
sophie , that classy lady right over there ...
mm , i like this one .
she recently broke it off with me
because she wanted to be with a man
who had a dream and a drive .
so i have bought a drive ...
a lincoln town car .
yes , i have a new car service and slogan :
&quot; lie back and i will ride you till you tell me to stop . &quot;
so , oleg , you now have a town car business ?
and sophie , you rent town cars all the time .
oh , oh , please .
i mean , i love pizza , too , but that doesn &apos;t mean
i have to marry papa john .
i was just thinking , you might want to come out back
and take a look at the light @-@ up makeup mirror on visors .
light @-@ up makeup mirror ?
oh , i might be interested .
but not just you and i.
han will come as well .
finally ! han is getting invited to something .
other than linkedin .
so much for the taste test . it &apos;s fine .
i know what &apos;s best for our cupcake business .
i do say that a lot ,
but i think it &apos;s kind of charming .
i &apos;ll go get our coats .
mm , mm , mm . look at you .
i must say , i &apos;m impressed with how far you &apos;ve come .
well , you burn a few thousand cupcakes ,
you &apos;re bound to get better .
not just the cupcakes , max .
look how far you &apos;ve come .
when i think of that girl who came in here
just looking to get by ...
hey , and check you out now .
big , fancy meeting in manhattan . lordy lord !
it &apos;s only a meeting , earl .
maybe .
but if you were one of these horses ,
i &apos;d put all of my money on you , max .
paul platt parties . please hold .
poor kid .
if i had that job , i &apos;d be asking someone
to please hold a gun to my head .
he &apos;s probably excited to be working for paul platt .
look at all these magazines
calling him the next martha stewart .
经过多年苦心经营 成为美国第二富婆
someday , we &apos;ll have articles about us .
you know , pictures of you and me
standing outside our country home .
hold on .
we &apos;re rich and still living together ?
okay , she &apos;s leaving . this is us .
about time .
been sitting here so long my ass is asleep ,
which kind of goes against my theory that it won &apos;t quit .
hi , paul &apos;s going to be a little longer .
it &apos;s fine . it &apos;s just how much ...
paul platt parties , please hold .
paul platt parties ...
how much longer ...
please hold .
me or them ?
i got the ass pins and needles .
max .
what ? we &apos;re on hold .
have a seat . five more minutes .
paul platt parties .
the word &quot; party &quot; at a party planner &apos;s ?
little obvious .
like me having art that says &quot; will die alone . &quot;
wait .
i think this is johnny &apos;s art . no way .
&quot; no way &quot; is right . johnny &apos;s a nobody .
paul platt wouldn &apos;t have a framed &quot; johnny &quot; in his office .
look , signed &quot; jpeg . &quot; that &apos;s his tag .
yo , what &apos;s the deal with this art ?
it &apos;s a street artist .
everyone &apos;s getting really into him now .
oh , yeah ?
he was trying to get into me a few months ago .
it was more emotional than that .
he cheated on his girlfriend with her
and then blew her off .
it was really hard for us .
and you thought me slapping my ass
in front of him was inappropriate ?
wow , johnny made it .
well , good for him .
he &apos;s making it , we &apos;re making it ...
we &apos;re making it ?
i magic @-@ markered over the scuffs on my boot ,
and we can &apos;t even get past
the poor man &apos;s john cusack over there .
max , we are making it .
we &apos;ve come a long way .
we haven &apos;t used starbucks napkins
for toilet paper in months .
and now , look where we are .
we &apos;ve got a meeting with paul platt .
say it , &quot; we &apos;re making it . &quot;
i &apos;m serious . say it , max .
we are making it .
okay , we &apos;re making it .
caroline channing .
this is us !
ahh .
what , five more minutes ?
monday at 4 : 00 . something came up .
oh , okay . well , monday at 4 : 00 .
there &apos;s no monday at 4 : 00 .
he said monday at 4 : 00 . monday at 4 : 00 , right ?
absolutely . monday at 4 : 00 .
there is no monday at 4 : 00 .
i &apos;m confused . is there a monday at 4 : 00 ?
in the books , monday at 4 : 00 . paul can &apos;t wait .
there is no monday at 4 : 00 .
i don &apos;t understand . are we coming in monday at 4 : 00 ?
absolutely . paul &apos;s a big fan .
don &apos;t come in on monday .
can you please tell me what &apos;s going on ?
see , it &apos;s this news about your father being moved
to a cushy white collar prison this week .
paul can &apos;t have anything to do with someone named channing ,
&apos;cause everyone in new york is pissed .
look at all that . it never stops .
how much more of this do i have to take ?
so we &apos;ll see you on monday !
don &apos;t come .
i woke my ass up for this ?
mmm . this was delicious , max .
here &apos;s a $ 20 . keep the change .
what are you doing , sophie ?
you don &apos;t pay for the cupcakes .
no , take it for your business .
ever since your big party planner meeting went bust ,
i was worried that you two girls
might form a joint suicide pact .
nah , we &apos;re not that organized .
so how &apos;s caroline today ?
she &apos;s handling it all better than i thought .
she &apos;s with her father &apos;s lawyer right now ,
trying to figure out the best time for her
to go out to the prison to see him before he &apos;s moved .
oh , that is my new phone .
you know there &apos;s a phone stuck to that gay furby , right ?
yes , this is from my favorite store on 14th street ,
rhinestoned .
oh , it &apos;s just a text from my driver .
he &apos;s waiting out front .
why don &apos;t you just invite oleg inside ?
i &apos;m not sure yet he deserves to come inside .
well , from what i heard , he &apos;s already come inside .
oh , max , i love it when you &apos;re dirty !
hey , how &apos;d it go ?
well , according to my father &apos;s lawyer ,
the prison is surrounded by so much press
that daddy doesn &apos;t want me to come out there
and be exploited all over again .
why is he still the only news story out there ?
well , the good news is ,
your hair is especially shiny today .
it is ? thanks , sophie .
so try not to kill yourself .
well , if i didn &apos;t kill myself reading these in the car ,
i won &apos;t .
hate mail .
it was being held at my old p.o. box .
my father &apos;s lawyer picked it up for me .
why didn &apos;t he just punch you in the face and call it a day ?
i know , it &apos;s like the end of miracle on 34th street ,
only everyone &apos;s calling me a bitch .
oh , come on , not everyone is calling you a bitch .
&quot; dear bitch , i hate you . &quot;
&quot; if i ever see you on the street , i will ... &quot;
shake your hand and wish you well ,
as you have been through so very much .
that is not what that says .
it might be .
it &apos;s hard to read his actual words ,
as they are written in blood .
oh , look how fancy . this is not hate mail .
no , this is invitation to metropolitan museum annual gala .
it is ?
this is my favorite social event in all of new york .
i &apos;ve gone every year since i was 18 .
it &apos;s a fashion ball at the museum of art ...
yeah , i know what it is .
i catered it last year .
max , how weird .
we were probably right in the very same room .
then there &apos;s a good chance i spit in your drink .
not really , unless you were acting all prissy and demanding .
there &apos;s a good chance you spit in my drink .
well , see ? this is happy news .
no , as much as i want to , i can &apos;t go .
everybody hates me .
and much worse , i have nothing to wear ,
and if you &apos;re gonna be hated , you better look damn good .
i give up . that invitation finally broke me .
why are you pulling down your bed ?
because i don &apos;t have a door to slam .
hell , i don &apos;t even have a door !
everything &apos;s been taken away , max ...
my fortune , my business career ,
my social life , my sweet , sweet horse .
okay , take a nap . you &apos;re upset .
you have a good reason to be .
a good reason ?
i say she has 200 , 300 good reasons .
i mean , read these .
these are like letters to the devil .
i &apos;m just going to get in there and never get out .
close it up , max . put me in the wall .
no , it &apos;s really hard to close it when you &apos;re in there .
i &apos;ve tried .
look , i know it &apos;s not even remotely close
to what you had before ,
but we do have our cupcake business
and our purple stove , and we do have $ 922 .
and we &apos;re gonna make it .
wall me .
come on , all you need is a big , glamorous party .
i mean , look at all the celebrities that are on the list
martha stewart ,
justin timberlake ...
ooh , hugh jackman !
oh , i like to call him &quot; huge &quot; jackman ,
because i bet he has a big penis .
wall me .
thank you , sir .
welcome home , buddy .
as you can see , we haven &apos;t put the pool in yet .
we &apos;ll get to it .
tree , grill , shovel ... usual cast of characters .
now , i am going to take you in to her ,
but i should warn you .
she hasn &apos;t been out of bed for two days ,
and that means no tooth brushing and it &apos;s bad up in there .
i &apos;m pretty sure horses have a keen sense of smell ,
so just be prepared .
i missed you , too .
max , i &apos;m trying to sleep . take your boots off .
caroline , i have something for you .
go away . i &apos;m dead .
jeez , and you said my breath was bad .
you have a visitor , someone you love .
chestnut ! chestnut , hi , baby , hi .
how did he get here ?
i went to peach and told her
it was a matter of life and death
and we had to have him back .
and what , she just gave him back to you ?
well , i did have to agree to come back and babysit
one day a week for the rest of my life ,
but hell , chestnut &apos;s home .
max , thank you so much . you brought me back to life .
oh , my god , don &apos;t exhale on me .
your breath is like you went down on a brussels sprout .
tip your head that way .
chestnut , chestnut .
don &apos;t breathe on him either !
his whole head is a nose . he can &apos;t handle that .
chestnut &apos;s home .
han , i &apos;m so excited .
did you hear my horse is back ?
this is not conversation .
this is just the other thing you say .
&quot; my cupcake business , my horse ,
my horse , my cupcake business . &quot;
well , in case anyone &apos;s interested ,
my ferret &apos;s name is alvin .
and alvin &apos;s telling his friends
he has a pet named han .
hey , earl . long time , no see .
well , well , well , johnny .
if it isn &apos;t the famous street artist .
well , i &apos;m hardly famous .
you got that right .
my remark was laced with sarcasm .
can you tell max i &apos;m here ?
that depends . are you still a two @-@ timing bum ?
that &apos;s his name ,
don &apos;t wear it out .
hiya , slugger .
can you do me a favor and call earl off ?
i may be on day six of my p90x ,
but i &apos;m in no shape to take on a heavyweight like him .
it &apos;s okay , earl , we &apos;re cool .
well , i am . he &apos;s just riding my fumes .
so , uh , where &apos;s your section ?
counter .
hm , same ol &apos; , same ol &apos; .
johnny &apos;s in the diner .
why is he here ? it can &apos;t be to eat .
he &apos;s &quot; made it . &quot; he eats &quot; made it food &quot; now .
well , obviously , he &apos;s here to see you .
or else he won the award for biggest lying jerk in new york ,
and this is the first stop on his press tour .
well , i don &apos;t know why he &apos;s here ,
but you better come with me .
he looks really good , so i &apos;m not listening
to a thing coming out of his pretty mouth .
well , i was gonna ask what the specials were ,
but you know what ? can i actually just get
one of max &apos;s homemade cupcakes ?
okay , which flavor ?
surprise me .
kind of like how you surprised her with your girlfriend ?
okay , i &apos;m starting to get a vibe here ,
and that &apos;s why i came in , because i feel bad ,
the way things went down between us ,
and i came to say good @-@ bye
because i &apos;m moving .
oh , moving . to where ?
manhattan .
manhattan ?
that hardly calls for a good @-@ bye speech .
it &apos;s over there .
yeah , i know , but it &apos;s a big change for me ,
and we &apos;re not going to be rolling
in the same circles anymore ,
and i &apos;m getting married ... over there .
well , at least you and your girlfriend worked it out .
actually , we broke up .
this is someone i met a couple months ago .
i was only watching his lips ,
but did they just say what i think they said ?
well , there &apos;s your cupcake . that &apos;ll be $ 5 .
the price has gone up . yeah , we &apos;re successful now .
in fact , we may be working with martha stewart .
caroline knows her from , you know , before .
we &apos;re gonna talk it over with her
at the met gala ball that caroline got invited to .
martha &apos;s on the committee . caroline goes every year .
not a big deal .
my first time . not a big deal either .
in fact , none of it &apos;s a big deal ,
just two girls who are making it
but who choose to stay in brooklyn &apos; cause we &apos;re cool .
that &apos;s awesome , max . that &apos;s awesome .
it &apos;s just funny , because whenever i think of you ,
i think of you in this diner in that uniform .
in a good way .
you want money now ?
yeah . it &apos;s business .
it &apos;s not like we had a relationship or anything .
in fact , you can pay caroline .
she &apos;s the money . i &apos;m the artist .
you know , i &apos;m doing pretty well as an artist myself .
i &apos;ve been selling a lot of my stuff .
really ? we hadn &apos;t heard .
and there &apos;s your cupcake .
in case you didn &apos;t notice , that container &apos;s to go .
got it .
he &apos;s gone . i got rid of him .
max ?
what are you doing ?
punching cheesecakes .
it &apos;s my version of going to bed for two days .
are you more upset about the marriage thing or the uniform thing ?
oh , this isn &apos;t about johnny . i &apos;m mad at the cheesecakes .
they were supposed to have cherries on top ,
and i wanted cherries !
why not me ?
okay , maybe it &apos;s half no cherries , half johnny .
nothing ever does work out for us .
and then i hear myself saying all that ridiculous stuff
about us talking to martha stewart at the gala .
i mean , what was that ? it &apos;s insane .
is it ?
wait , seriously , is it ?
or is it just insane enough to be genius ?
max , we have the invitation . she &apos;ll be there .
why are we wasting our time with paul platt
when we can meet the real thing ?
we can take martha our best cupcake ,
explain our situation ,
and maybe ... maybe she &apos;ll talk to us .
i mean , she was a girl with a dream once , too ,
and she certainly understands hard times .
you are talking about us stalking martha stewart .
i am talking about us stalking martha stewart !
i even have my gorgeous judith leiber jeweled cupcake purse
to smuggle the cupcake in . it &apos;s perfect .
i knew there was a reason i took that from the townhouse .
great , you have a cupcake and a cupcake purse .
what else are we gonna wear to the ball , cinderella ?
are the rats in the alley gonna whip us up some ball gowns ?
i mean , it &apos;s not exactly like we have a fairy godmother .
hey , look , girls !
i got myself a crown and a wand at rhinestoned .
i &apos;ll have the soup in my booth .
well , this is as close to a fairytale
as you and i are ever gonna get , so what the hell ?
max , does that mean we &apos;re gonna find
a way to go to the ball ?
oh , yeah . get your cupcake on ,
&apos;cause we &apos;re gonna get balled .
sophie , this is so generous of you
to offer to buy us dresses for the gala ,
but as much as my shoes love being back
in their place of birth ...
oh , your shoes were born here ?
mine were born in china , but i adopted them at payless .
maybe we should find something cheaper ,
at one of those consignment stores .
&quot; consignment stores &quot; ?
come on , what are we , gypsies ?
this is big fancy ball . we need ball gowns .
never really been a fan of balls .
in fact , always thought they got in the way ,
but here we are .
well , we do have to look amazing
if we &apos;re approaching martha stewart with a cupcake ,
so we &apos;ll find a way to pay you back
and start by doing some cleaning jobs for you for free .
no !
every year i give money to charity ,
and i like you two girls way more than the babies
with the broken smiles .
so don &apos;t worry . i got plenty of cash .
aww , a roll of hundreds .
reminds me of my christmas stocking stuffers .
yeah , this is fun day .
i &apos;m like richard gere and you &apos;re my two hookers .
在 《 风月俏佳人 》 中扮演爱上妓女的钻石王老五
well , when you put it like that ,
i &apos;m a little more comfortable .
good afternoon . how can i help you ?
hi , how are you ? we don &apos;t have a lot of time .
we have to be at work by 6 : 00 .
can you show us your best formal spring couture ?
perhaps you ladies might be more comfortable
down in ready @-@ to @-@ wear .
as i said , we &apos;re in a bit of a rush .
we might move a little quicker if you dropped the attitude
and picked up some dresses .
show her your wad .
let &apos;s look at some dresses .
yeah , and get us some champagne ,
like in the movies .
one , two ...
han , did you just go up on your tiptoes like a big boy ?
well , i wasn &apos;t expecting a photo opportunity .
and i left my tom cruise man @-@ heels at home .
max , give him a break .
this is a man who was too short to be a jockey .
oleg , give me your camera .
i must approve picture .
we &apos;ve taken it three times already .
han , if you want a nip slip , just ask .
my dress is too pretty for this conversation ,
so i &apos;m gonna go get the cupcake from the refrigerator .
and i &apos;m going to warm up my new town car for the ladies .
new ?
what is this , 2002 ?
i hope so ,
then i will have chance to meet you for first time all over again .
now this is not professional driver talk .
hey , fancy ball buster , what &apos;s your deal ?
you told him to get a dream and a drive ,
and he did .
max , i have two sore spots .
trusting men and ...
and here , where that crazy jamaican
wove my extensions too tight .
i &apos;m thinking i should wait to put the cupcake
in the cupcake purse till we get out of the car .
we want our beer batter maple bacon cupcake
to represent our cupcake business .
we have a new record .
she cupcake four times in one speech .
we should go .
upper east side from brooklyn at this time of day is crazy .
but we came in here to show earl .
maybe earl decided not to come
since he had the night off .
max , we really should be there at the start .
that &apos;s prime martha stewart stalking time .
you &apos;re right . and martha will probably
have to leave early to get up to bake ;
a little something i knows about .
the only difference between martha and i
is she probably doesn &apos;t have to worry about
waking up her roommate who lives four feet from the oven .
but otherwise , twinsies !
hold up , hold up , hold up .
earl , slow down , your heart .
sorry i &apos;m late , ladies .
but if i run any faster , the cops tend to pull guns on me .
got held up at the florist shop ,
but i made it . here you go , ladies .
aww , earl , you got us flowers ?
wrist corsages .
i hope they &apos;re still in style .
they &apos;re a classic , earl .
like you .
mmm , that was worth the run .
let &apos;s go , ladies .
oleg is waiting to drive you .
and you drive me crazy .
yeah , yeah . tell it to the marines .
here , earl , take my phone .
i can &apos;t fit it in the purse with my cupcake .
have the best time in the world .
and say hello to &quot; huge &quot; jackman for me .
that is not a good sign .
that car is smoking harder than
bob marley on a rasta holiday .
他笃信视大麻为圣餐的斯塔法教
sophie , if my cousin yuri said he would be here
in half hour with parts to fix ,
he will be here in half hour .
actually , it &apos;s been 40 minutes .
your cousin is like you .
he takes too long to come .
oh , this is news .
suddenly a woman wants a man to finish fast .
oh , please .
sex is not a carnival cruise .
i &apos;m a busy woman .
you get on , you get off .
can i get a hit off that ?
we &apos;ll just have to wait , i guess .
i mean , if i still lived in manhattan , i &apos;d hail a cab .
but that &apos;s not gonna happen out here in the boondocks !
plus , even if we could afford a cab ,
we &apos;d be stuck forever in rush hour gridlock .
could you take it down a notch ?
hipsters are starting to look at us
like we &apos;re trying too hard .
where did han go ?
he said he might have a plan .
oh , my lord and taylor !
that little mother can ride .
you two look like two princesses in a fairy tale .
are you feeling safe ?
i couldn &apos;t feel any safer
if we were riding a rubber into town .
here we go . bye , guys .
bye .
go , chestnut !
oh , check it out . you see what i see ?
hello , officers .
we &apos;re on way to the ball down the street ,
and we were wondering if we could please leave
our horse with your horses ?
and i can save you the time
on the breathalyzer test ;
no , we are not drunk
or on some bachelorette party scavenger hunt .
our car broke down in brooklyn ,
so we rode over the brooklyn bridge and up .
you rode a horse across the brooklyn bridge ?
that &apos;s badass .
yes ... and illegal .
in that case , we took the tunnel .
well , i think we can help you two ladies .
not gonna happen , dave . we &apos;re on duty .
officers , we &apos;re already a little late .
and with all due respect , we don &apos;t have time
to play good cop , bad cop .
or in your cases , hot cop , hot cop .
well , i think we can help you ladies .
let &apos;s get you down off of there .
i got the one in the low @-@ cut .
thanks officer hot and officer hotter .
you know i &apos;m officer hotter , right ?
oh , come on , man . have you seen me in my sunglasses ?
no contest .
max , i &apos;m really impressed with how well
you &apos;re maneuvering around in that long skirt .
yeah , i was a serving wench at a medieval times restaurant .
it &apos;s a breeze when i &apos;m not carrying
a tray loaded with turkey legs and ale .
there &apos;s the &quot; will call &quot; table .
walk in front and i &apos;ll hide behind you ,
as i &apos;m the most hated woman in new york .
so basically , i &apos;m a human shield ?
well , you have more up here to stop anything .
max !
what ?
did someone pull a gun ?
i knew that was gonna happen .
no , i screamed because i saw the couple
whose sworn statement put my father in prison .
max !
acid in your pretty face ?
sorry , i stayed up all night reading
what people want to do to you in your hate mail .
what was it ?
i went down so fast , i may have smeared my cupcake .
that &apos;s the filthiest sounding clean thing i ever heard .
it &apos;s fine . good .
now let &apos;s go get those cheap plastic security bracelets
that ruin our expensive gowns .
can i get your name ?
caroline ...
channing .
i &apos;m sorry , what ?
caroline ...
channing .
what &apos;s with you ? just say your name .
channing .
did you say channing ? caroline channing ?
wait , are you that caroline channing ?
shh , yes , and i personally called the r.s.v.p. number .
it has to be there .
channing , channing , channing ...
no , i don &apos;t see &quot; caroline channing . &quot;
maybe it &apos;s under my name .
max black . i &apos;m with her .
black ... no , no , no , i don &apos;t see any blacks here .
you mean besides the ones working security ?
let me check with paul platt , the party planner .
he &apos;s on the phone with him right now .
hey , brody .
oh , no .
there &apos;s a problem with the list .
she &apos;s not on it . her .
caroline channing .
paul , i &apos;ve got caroline channing ,
and she &apos;s not on the list .
if everybody in this line could just wait until
we get the caroline channing situation under control ...
if you say &quot; channing &quot; one more time ,
i &apos;m going to actually pull your voice box out .
and its s so much more violent than it sounds .
yes , paul , i &apos;ll tell them .
there &apos;s been a little mix @-@ up .
five more minutes will get you right in .
you &apos;re not getting in .
well , that &apos;s it . we tried .
we gave it our best shot .
oh , no .
this is the closest i have ever gotten
to anything in my life almost working out .
we are not giving up .
how are we getting in ?
security &apos;s everywhere .
yeah , out here ,
but not at the servers &apos; entrance .
i catered this last year .
that &apos;s right , we &apos;re going backdoor .
that lady just punched me .
i knew that was gonna happen !
so you can just walk in here ?
anyone can just walk right in ?
well , it helps that last year
i made out with the tent flap guard , rico ,
but basically , yeah , anyone .
when i think of all the times
i left my purse on a table here unattended ,
i shudder ... shudder .
okay , so we can &apos;t get in the actual building
without being caterers ,
so we have to change into those uniforms .
wait .
you never mentioned anything about
a rent @-@ a @-@ clothes situation .
small price to pay for us making it .
is it ? is it a small price to pay ?
hurry , we have a superstar to stalk !
i thought i would hate it , but i &apos;m kind of into it .
i &apos;m very janelle monae .
no , you &apos;re janelle i @-@ have @-@ no @-@ monae .
what are we going to do with our dresses ?
we can &apos;t leave them out here . i need them inside .
i have to look amazing when i meet martha stewart .
what does it matter what we &apos;re wearing ?
we &apos;re still going to be the two crazy girls
chasing her down with a cupcake .
that &apos;s why it matters .
i know . here .
help me get the shelves out of this .
we can hang our dresses in here
and push them in .
brilliant .
kind of like the louis vuitton travel wardrobe i used to have .
or the service elevator i was born in .
coming through , hot food .
look out , very hot ! man , it &apos;s hot .
you &apos;re a waiter , not a weatherman .
hey , pretty girls ,
i like the way you push around that big steel box
why don &apos;t you come over here and i &apos;ll have sex with you ?
a display like that really makes you appreciate
oleg &apos;s nuanced wit .
okay , let &apos;s go right to the ladies room so we can change .
is it that way or that way ?
what ?
shh , johnny !
how &apos;d he get invited ?
this used to be an exclusive event .
he &apos;s &quot; made it , &quot;
he goes where &quot; made it &quot; people go .
why are we hiding from that lowlife ?
if he sees me in another waiter uniform ,
i &apos;m the sad girl always in the uniform .
if he sees me in that dress at the ball ,
he can suck it .
ladies room , that way .
the ladies room is right down here .
push harder .
harder ! do you want martha to see you dressed like that ?
move ! coming through !
excuse us .
food emergency .
fingers , fingers , fingers , fingers .
coming through , coming through .
excuse us .
look alive , red !
i almost hit you .
hold up .
now just hold up . what is going on right now ?
you can &apos;t bring food in here .
oh , it &apos;s not food . that would be weird .
it &apos;s dresses . we have to change into these ,
&apos;cause she has this guy she wants to impress ,
and i have to change into it
because i &apos;m stalking martha stewart .
ooh , i &apos;d be a terrible spy .
usually i don &apos;t get the long stories
till the end of the night ,
and by then , the girls are crying
and begging me for wisdom and tic tacs .
i &apos;ll go first .
i have to get two of these in one dress .
miss , do you have a shoehorn ?
come on , chanel shoes !
come on , chanel knockoffs .
why are you not dressed yet ?
&apos;cause ladies take forever .
it &apos;s all the spanx .
well , go , use my stall . i want to go stick my head out ,
and see if i can scope out johnny .
no , ma &apos;am , no ! not fair , ma &apos;am .
try the handicapper . this side .
good idea .
i cannot get a break tonight .
psst , yo , max .
johnny !
who are you looking for ?
the dominos guy .
i was hiding in there , &apos; cause five more minutes ,
the pizza &apos;s free .
i was hoping i &apos;d run into you .
eh , no big deal .
pretty big deal . you look amazing .
amazing . i will go as far as amaze @-@ balls .
thanks .
you look like a guy in a commercial
who has a ring and puppy hidden somewhere .
can you believe it ?
we &apos;re both at this shmancy thing .
look how far we &apos;ve gotten .
actually , when you think about it ,
we didn &apos;t get very far at all .
nope , you &apos;re right . we didn &apos;t .
yeah , why ?
timing , i guess .
timing ?
okay , whatever .
you know , from now on , when i think of you ,
i &apos;m gonna think of you in this and not the uniform .
you know , from now on ,
maybe you shouldn &apos;t think of me at all .
gotta go , mr. manhattan .
that was awesome ! caroline , where are you ?
i &apos;m almost dressed .
i just had the perfect in @-@ your @-@ face good @-@ bye with johnny .
and speaking of &quot; in your face , &quot;
he couldn &apos;t take his eyes off my boobs ...
boobs that he can never have ,
now that he &apos;s getting married .
damn , girl , you look good . what you doing later ?
can i get your number ?
oh , no , the cupcake got a little smushed in my purse .
we can &apos;t show this to martha stewart now .
sure , we can .
you think she never had a cupcake smush on her ?
i doubt that very much .
martha stewart is perfect .
her feet don &apos;t even touch the ground .
the woman probably doesn &apos;t even go to the bathroom .
martha stewart &apos;s hardly perfect .
and how are you this evening ?
no , you &apos;re right , martha stewart isn &apos;t perfect .
oh , i never said that !
in fact , i hear she &apos;s a real ballbuster .
you did not hear that .
yep , a real ballbuster , you know ?
no , i do not know .
would you mind handing me a towelette please ?
oh , one &apos;s fine . thank you so much .
but the fact that martha stewart is so tough ...
caroline , you need to get out here right now .
the fact that she is a real ballbuster ...
oh , dear god , help me .
is what i like and respect about her .
i mean , the woman &apos;s a genius .
now it &apos;s getting interesting .
and besides , you can &apos;t really believe gossip .
look at all that hate mail i got
with people calling me a bitch ,
and i &apos;m not a bitch .
well , that &apos;s debatable .
martha stewart , hi .
hello .
i &apos;m caroline , and this is my business partner , max ,
and we have a start @-@ up cupcake business .
dude , are you serious ? you &apos;re still going for it .
i know this is highly inappropriate ,
but we brought a cupcake here tonight
in hopes that you might taste it .
so you want me to taste your cupcake
in the ladies room .
what &apos;s inappropriate about that ?
we &apos;re a start @-@ up business . we &apos;ve got to take risks .
this is max . she &apos;s the baker .
you &apos;re the baker .
i &apos;m the baker .
hm , it looks quite appealing .
oh , my god .
i know this is a social event ,
so i &apos;m so sorry for making it about business .
when you &apos;re in business for yourself ,
you have to take every situation
as a business opportunity .
look , i have five of these in here .
i love your magazine .
i read every single issue
until they realized i didn &apos;t even go to that doctor .
well , in spite of the fact
that you have not yet washed your hands ...
i was just changing my dress in there .
i &apos;ll taste it .
you will ?
i like your entrepreneurial drive .
and i have a feeling that it &apos;s actually
the only way i &apos;m gonna get out of here alive .
that is our beer batter maple bacon
spring break cupcake .
hm , clever name .
thank you .
it is a little smushed , though . that &apos;s unfortunate .
i told you .
mmm . quiet tasty .
i like it .
do you girls have a card ?
get it out , get it out , get it out .
ah , thank you very much .
&quot; max &apos;s homemade cupcakes . &quot;
well , you know who &apos;d really like that cupcake ?
stoners .
she said &quot; max &apos;s homemade cupcakes . &quot;
martha stewart likes our cupcakes !
martha stewart likes our cupcakes !
