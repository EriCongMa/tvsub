My name is Elena Gilbert, and I'm a vampire.
I'm learning how to survive, but there are complications.
You're sired to me, Elena.
Everything that you think you feel
Might not even be real.
But there's hope now.
Tell them what the hunter
told you the tattoo leads to.
He said there was a cure.
Everyone wants it for a different reason.
For revenge...
To be human and in love...
For the truth...
I'm setting you free, Elena.
Aand some will stop at nothing to get it.
Do it!
Carol Lockwood always said that togetherness
in times of tragedy,
leads to healing.
That one community is stronger than a thousand of its members.
but how does a community stay strong
after losing its leader?
And Carol was so much more than just a mayor.
She was...
an open-minded friend...
And a concerned mother,
taken from us too soon
by a terrible accident.
Screw this.
What?
Tyler.
Tyler.
Please join me in observing
a minute of silence in her memory.
You ok?
I'll be right back.
Thank you very much.
In the wake of this tragedy,
the town has selected an interim mayor.
Many of you already know him.
Please welcome Mr. Rudy Hopkins.
Thank you, sheriff.
Carol Lockwood put this town first,
and that's why I'm here to talk to you guys.
You folks...
April?
What's wrong?
Nothing. I'm fine.
But you're crying.
It's just the whole mayor thing.
You know, it's bringing up stuff with my dad.
And I know you're a vampire.
Wait. What?
Was that necessary?
No, but it was fun.
You just missed the mandatory all-school assembly.
That's because I'm at a mandatory all-alone drinking party.
Seriously? You decided to go on a ripper bender now?
My brother slept with Elena.
Kind of puts a little bit of a damper on things.
First of all, you are not supposed to know that.
Second of all, Tyler is already spiraling,
and he gets priority.
His mother just died. What do you expect?
I'm his girlfriend. I expect him to talk to me.
But instead he's all angry,
and it doesn't help that everyone keeps referring to
his mother's death as an accident,
which is really just a polite way of saying that she was drunk.
You think Klaus killed her?
I don't think she drowned in a martini glass.
Just get it together. I can't do it alone.
The assembly's over.
What the hell's going on?
The school will be empty soon.
How many times did you compel me?
Don't-- just don't lie.
Rebekah says you lie.
Rebekah's not who you think she is, April.
What, she's not a thousand-year-old original vampire?
Listen, we can figure this out, ok,
but we have to get out of here.
Sorry. Not allowed.
Why don't you take a seat?
The rest of the class will be here shortly.
First saved message.
It's me.
Look, I know why you sent me away.
You think that what I'm feeling for you
is because of the sire bond,
but I hate not being near you.
Go ahead. Make a move.
I drove up here to be your wingman, not kick your ass.
Ok.
I get it. I get it.
You're a badass.
You see that?
Couldn't miss it. It was in slow motion.
Then teach me something useful.
We've been here for days, and so far
all you've done is bark orders.
Ok.
Take a seat at the bench, quarterback.
Karate kid wants a shot at the title.
Jeremy, you're not ready for this.
Well?
Now, all I have to do is apply
a little pressure under your jaw.
Really? Again?
Double pepperoni 3 days in a row.
You guys eat anything else?
Why? Are you offering?
A little something extra,
cut off the pizza pipeline for a couple days.
No matter how much they beg, don't come back.
Sorry, guys.
You're gonna starve us now?
If that's what it takes to make you a hunter.
Now run around the lake, twice.
Keep him company.
I don't have to listen to you.
You do if you want to eat.
...Being near you, and I miss you. Damon
I wish you would just let me come to you.
What?
Guess who.
I'm back, dagger-free,
and I'm holding Elena hostage at the high school.
Just thought you should know.
Who the hell was dumb enough to pull that dagger out of you?
I'll be asking the questions today.
See ya soon.
I am only ready to talk to you if you're ready to rejoin civilization.
How would you like to
drive the white oak stake through Rebekah's heart?
If it means you're not
drinking your way through the mystic grill, sure.
So...
First speech under your belt.
Now for the fun part.
Welcome to the world of careful cover-ups.
We've ruled Carol's death as head trauma from a fall.
That's the official autopsy.
She did not go gently, did she?
Any leads?
We have ideas.
Let me guess.
Sharp teeth and bad table manners?
You sure you want this?
I mean, 6 people were offered this job before you.
They all said no for a reason.
I'm saying yes for a reason,
and my reason just walked in.
I'll let you know what we find.
Thank you, sheriff.
Hey, sheriff. Hey, dad.
So...
Far cry from being a traveling pharmaceutical rep.
I noticed a few of your friends missing from the assembly.
So much for mandatorat I guess, huh?
Dad, stop it.
You can't come in here and start making rules.
I think this town could use a few more rules.
You're forgetting I can help protect the town.
I am well aware of your gifts, Bonnie...
But don't forget I'm your father.
That means that I get to protect you.
一楼 我去吸引她注意力 你用木桩捅她
Hello, Stefan.
I'm here. What do you want?
The same thing I wanted when you helped make Klaus stab me.
The cure.
I hope you're not waiting for Caroline to show up
and stake me...
Because I already found her.
Stefan.
Did I say you could move?
Class is in session.
You've all been compelled. You know the rules.
Answer my questions honestly,
no disobedience,
no one leaves.
April, my sweet, take notes.
This is how you get answers in this town.
Let's start with a little quiz.
In the year 1114, my brother learned-- thanks to yours truly--
about a brotherhood of vampire hunters
with tattoos that grew with each kill.
And these tattoos reveal what? Elena?
A map.
Which led to, Caroline?
A cure for vampirism.
Perfect. We're all caught up.
Stefan Salvatore, the last time we saw each other,
you had a vampire hunter,
but in order to decode the map,
you needed the location of the hunter's sword,
which you got out of me using some very dirty tricks.
Assuming you found the sword,
you must have found the cure,
and yet you're all still vampires,
which means something went wrong.
What are you doing?
You asked me to take notes.
I wasn't being literal, darling.
But now that you mention it,
a flow chart would be nice,
which means index cards and push pins. Go fetch.
You're wasting your time.
We don't know anything.
So you just gave up?
I thought you'd do anything to save Elena,
even if it meant taking the cure yourself
so you could grow old and die with her.
Why do you look so surprised?
I'm missing something. What is it?
They broke up, ok?
Now let us go.
Broke up?
Wait. I'm confused.
I thought Elena was your epic love, Stefan.
I asked you what happened,
and you have to tell me.
She slept with Damon.
Good.
Now...
Now do it like your life depends on it 'cause it does.
Don't act like you care about my life.
You care about the hunter's mark and curing Elena
so she's not sired to your ass.
Both require you to be alive,
which is why I've updated our relationship status to
"It's complicated."
You talked to her at all?
Elena?
Maybe.
Why? Runing out of voicemails to listen to?
I'm sorry. Did I interrupt play time?
What the hell are you doing here?
I'm simply appreciating the sights and smells of nature,
neither of which presently include rotting vampire flesh,
so I'm a bit concerned.
How many vampires has he killed?
If we throw Jeremy out into the world right now, he's chum.
Now, see, that's not a number.
12--that's a number.
That's how many of my hybrids I slaughtered with my sword.
3--that's how many days it took
to quell the urge to kill your brother,
after he knowingly watched as I walked into a death trap.
One...
That's the number of purposes you serve.
You are here to grow Jeremy's mark,
So I ask again...
How many vampires has he killed since he's been here?
Zero.
That's a pity.
I'm going to need that cure
sooner rather than later,
Hybrid shortage and all.
How can I help?
You know...
Now that you mention it,
Jeremy... watch and learn.
That's for Carol Lockwood.
So, vampire Elena is a trollop who likes bad boys,
which explains why Stefan reeks of alcohol.
But what it doesn't explain is why sweet, loving,
innocent Elena could be so heartless towards Stefan.
How could she hurt you like that? Answer, please.
She didn't know it at the time,
but she was sired to Damon.
A sire bond. Fascinating.
And what do you think about that, Elena?
I think you're sad and bored
and in desperate need of a hobby.
You're hiding something. 'fess up.
I didn't sleep with Damon because of his sire bond.
I slept with Damon because I'm in love with him.
What does any of this have to do with the stupid cure?
You're right. We got off the point.
Stefan, how do I find the cure?
Unless you'd rather talk about Damon and Elena all day.
There's a professor. He knows where the cure is.
Thank you. And, uh, where do I find this professor?
Oh, and so now I'm "Gifted"?
He hates my witch heritage.
That's why he travels all the time.
He can't handle it.
And suddenly he wants to be a protective father?
No. Not like this.
Come on. Distract me.
Isn't there some...
magic therapy thing you haven't shown me yet?
Listen, Bonnie, I hate to tell you this--
Actually, you know what? I take that back.
I'm proud to tell you this.
You don't need my help anymore.
In fact...
I was hoping to present this with a cupcake or something.
Happy graduation.
It's beautiful.
It's human bone.
Legend says it was worn by the 2,000-year-old witch Qetsiyah,
Who drew on it... for strength.
Bonnie, you have come so far so fast.
If you trust my opinion,
your magic is exactly where it needs to be.
Does this mean I have to go home now?
It means I got a stack of papers I got to grade by tomorrow.
I can take a hint.
Thanks, Shane.
Oh, my god.
Kol.
Shane?
I told you I don't want to talk.
I heard. You're keeping all that rage
bottled up inside.
Caroline's worried sick about you.
Rebekah?
Hello, Tyler.
I heard my brother made a real mess of your life.
Believe me, I can relate. You have my condolences.
In fact, why don't you come down to the high school
so you can accept them in person?
And why would I do that?
Because I have your girlfriend.
Maybe you have a better shot at saving her than you did your mother.
Bye now.
Sister...
Look at this.
You're even worse than Klaus.
Kol. Finally.
Did you bring me what I asked for?
You must be Shane.
If you're here for payback, go for it.
But you'll be stuck baby-sitting the little hunter that could.
You know...
If you adjust your angle a little bit,
you'll find a sharper edge.
I know how to whittle. Thanks.
Now I know why those hybrids hated you.
You are annoying.
Actually, I'm just perplexed
as to why Jeremy hasn't killed any vampires.
Darwinism, Klaus.
He needs to be able to protect himself
before we hunt down his first vampire nest.
And here was I, thinking you were the fun brother.
Well, let's play a little game, shall we?
Jeremy needs more victims,
and there's a whole town of people down the road
just waiting to be turned into vampires for the slaughter.
You don't think that occurred to me, Klaus?
The tragedy is, Damon,
it did occur to you, yet you chose to ignore it.
And my guess is you did it to impress Elena.
Somehow, to honor her, you'll find a way
to spare innocent lives
and walk Jeremy down the moral high road.
That's why I've already made the necessary corrections.
What did you do?
Don't tell me he ordered another pizza.
No, I'm just an idiot.
I ran out of gas and my phone's dead.
Think I could use yours?
Yeah, come on in.
I'll run upstairs and grab my cell.
What the hell?
What are you doing here?
Car drama.
Your friend just went to go get his phone.
Well, I'm about to go take a shower,
but you're more than welcome to wait inside.
Thanks.
Kol...
And Rebekah Mikaelson,
two members of the original vampire family.
This is such a trip.
Where's the cure?
Compulsion won't work.
It's a little trick I picked up in Tibet.
Right. Well, we'll just have to do this the old-fashioned way.
Beat him until he tells you where to find it.
Still glued to your seats?
Ooh, it's thick with tension in here.
Let's spice things up a bit.
Elena, truth or dare?
We're done playing your stupid games, Rebekah.
Truth or dare, Elena?
You're compelled. Answer.
Dare.
I dare you to tell Stefan the truth about Damon.
Seriously?
Being with Damon makes me happy.
Makes you happy?
Clowns make you happy, Elena.
Dig a little deeper.
When I'm with him...
It feels unpredictable, like...
like I'm free.
And how do you feel when you're with Stefan?
Stop.
She can't. She's compelled.
Lately, I feel like I'm a project,
like I'm a problem that needs to be fixed.
I think I make him sad.
And I can't be with someone like that
because...
When he looks at me, all he sees is a broken toy.
Do you still love Stefan?
Yes.
Are you still in love with Stefan?
No.
Did that hurt,
having someone you love drive a dagger through your heart?
Go to hell.
Did...that...hurt?
Yes.
Welcome to the last 900 years of my life.
Ah, good, you're here. It was just getting depressing.
What the hell is going on?
Listen to the rules carefully.
Stay in the building. No vamp-running in the hallways.
Vamp-running from what?
Turn.
What?
You can't. He'll lose control.
That's the whole point.
I've exhausted all your knowledge.
Now I have the professor to help me find the cure,
you're just competition.
Whoever finds it first gets to decide what to do with it:
use it, share it, destroy it, save it...
I want that to be me.
But if I turn, I'll kill them.
Yes, you will.
Turn.
Did you find your phone?
Bonnie?
How did you know everyone was here?
Who's everyone? I came to find Shane.
Did you do a GPS magic locator spell or something?
Rebekah told me that you're a witch.
Rebekah? What the hell is going on?
Rebekah has Stefan, Elena, and Caroline compelled.
She's getting them to actually tell the truth for a change.
What?
Shane can't be compelled.
She'll have him torture him to find out what he knows.
What are you looking for?
I need salt.
I think I just saw some.
What are you doing?
If this pendant will connect me to Shane,
then I can do a protection spell.
Where is the cure?!
Where is the cure?
You're human. Why do you want it anyway?
That's the beauty of this.
You can have it. I just want Silas.
No.
What do you know about Silas?
He's the world's first immortal being,
who just happens to be imprisoned with the cure.
And I want to free him.
No!
April?
What's happening?
Stop!
He's of no use dead.
Did you not hear what he said?
Silas will kill us all, sister.
Silas does not exist.
He is a fairy tale
made up to scare children into eating their vegetables.
Silas is very real.
I know where he's buried,
and soon I'll have the spell that wakes him.
Wait a second. You're lying.
You can't get to him...
Without his tombstone?
Dozens to die in a blood sacrifice?
Believe me, I know, I've done it.
Those massacres are a pain to engineer.
You're the one who got the council blown up.
It was a noble sacrifice...
and temporary.
Because once I raise Silas,
Silas will raise the dead.
He will bring back every last soul who died on his behalf.
No!
Oh, my god!
I can fight it.
Aah! Get out of here!
Go.
That door's not gonna hold him.
You should be thanking me.
You killed my only chance at finding the cure.
Silas on the loose would be hell on earth.
And frankly, sister...
I don't think you could handle it.
How did you get that?
Way too easily.
Bonnie.
Help! Someone help!
Bonnie, what's going on?
She needs help.
What happened?
I did a protection spell
but it accidentally linked Shane to April.
And you couldn't control it?
I didn't even know I was doing it.
Usually I feel pain or I bleed,
but this time I just felt more power.
It's ok. It's ok.
You're ok. You're ok. You're ok.
Bonnie, get her out of the school.
Just be careful. Tyler is out there, and he turned.
What about you?
No, we can't leave. Rebekah's compelled us.
Just go. We'll deal with her later. Come on.
Stefan...
No.
Stefan, we have to talk about this, please.
Talk about what, huh?
How many more ways are there for you to rip my heart out?
I'm sorry.
Sorry that it happened, or sorry that I found out?
I'm sorry about all of it.
I'm really sorry, Stefan.
I didn't mean to hurt you. I didn't want that.
Why are my least favorite people always the most durable?
Tyler...
I'm so sorry.
It wasn't your fault.
Yes, it was.
This whole thing.
It's all my fault.
No.
I should have saved her.
Leave her out of this.
This is between me and you.
You're still protecting her?
Must I rip your bleeding heart from your chest
and show you the scar tissue that is Elena Gilbert?
There's a solution to all your problems, you know.
I could compel him...
Erase every memory he has of you.
Every day you've spent together,
every kiss, every lie, every ounce of pain.
I can take away every bit of love he has for you.
Give you both a clean slate.
Just say the word, and I'll make you
and all that misery you've caused him disappear.
Do it.
Excuse me?
Erase it all. Every memory.
Stefan, no.
I said do it.
No. That would be far too easy.
I refuse to make you forget her the way Klaus made you forget me.
But at least you know how he really feels.
Consider your eternity of pain my revenge, Stefan.
I've used you for all you're worth.
So now you're free to go.
Stefan, wait.
Turns out I miscalculated.
Kol's gonna be a problem.
I almost killed someone,
and that's what you miscalculated?
April could've died today.
That's only because you didn't know the extent of your abilities.
My father just became mayor.
I can't be out doing black magic.
That's not what expression is.
Then what is it?
It's a way of doing magic that isn't monitored by nature or the spirits.
It isn't good nor bad.
But it also has no limits.
So how you use it is up to you.
That's what I'm here for...
To help you.
Bonnie, listen to me. You are the key to everything.
I'm not going to let anything bad happen to you.
Hope your day is going better than mine.
Got to say, I'm liking the odds.
Stefan knows about us.
How'd he take it?
How do you think?
I'm thinking, for the first time all week,
I'm happy to be at camp nowhere.
How's Jeremy?
That depends on how much you trust me.
You know that I trust you.
Then I think he's gonna get through this thing just fine.
Thanks for looking out for him.
Yeah, well, I told them if they were good,
I'd buy them both ice cream, so I got to go.
Not yet.
Something happened today.
I realized something about you, about us.
And you can say that it's the sire bond,
And you know what? Maybe--maybe it is.
But I'm telling you it's the most real thing
that I've ever felt in my entire life.
I love you, Damon.
I love you.
Look.
I'm going to get this cure for you.
And I'm gonna have to do things you don't like.
Damon--
But listen carefully.
Get in your car right now.
Come to me.
I'll be there soon.
You let yourself in.
You called me.
Should I be checking for hidden daggers?
Do you still want to find the cure?
More than anything.
I want to ram it down Niklaus' throat
and look into his eyes as he realizes he's mortal again.
But Shane's dead and you are useless,
so I'm right back where I started.
Shane's not dead.
But I watched Kol impale him.
Well, you probably shouldn't have left him alone.
Bonnie did a little spell.
He's perfectly fine.
You didn't have to tell me that.
Why am I really here?
You were right.
I'm gonna be here for an eternity,
and I will go insane if I don't know how Elena truly feels
about my brother.
If you really want the cure,
you should know that Shane has an agenda,
and it's a dark one.
He said he organized dozens of people to die in sacrifice.
He admitted to the council explosion where 12 people died,
And I'm guessing it's not a coincidence
that 12 hybrids died at the hand of my brother.
12...
Channeling the energy from a mass death is used
in witchcraft to perform dark spells.
It's called expression.
Shane admitted all this to you?
Proudly.
Well, then I guess we'll have to figure out how to manage him
while we find the cure for ourselves.
"We"?
There's no "We," Stefan.
Listen, I hate my brother, and you hate yours.
But Damon's got Jeremy, and Klaus has the sword,
And Shane has Bonnie.
You and I are the only ones left with nothing.
You said it yourself, right?
Whoever finds the cure first
gets to decide what to do with it.
What do you say? You want to be partners?
My father had no reason to kill 11 people.
He had no reason to kill himself.
He loved me.
He loved Mystic Falls.
He was brainwashed into sparking that fire.
Professor Shane organized his death
and the 11 others who died with him.
It's time this entire town started telling the truth.
I was beginning to worry
you boys wouldn't find the place.
What the hell...?
Did you kill all these people?
Not exactly.
They're in transition.
Killing them is your job.
You said you were going to convince Klaus to do this another way.
I thought about it.
And then I realized his idea was better.
