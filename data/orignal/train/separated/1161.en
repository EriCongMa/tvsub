Isn't that Garrett's car?
I think it is.
Where's he going?
Dad, why are you in Jason's house?
Spencer deserves some answers.
But not your damn business.
College will be a great experience for you.
You'll look back and realize
just how naive you were.
Really?
What is that?
Liquid courage.
Want some?
Hit me.
Kate was drinking, too.
Kate is not drunk.
Kate just gave a very touching toast alone!
You're done.
Give me the
What are you doing?
Let go! Stop it!
Are you okay?
When your father gets home,
this did not happen.
Hello, Maya.
Hello, Emily.
You didn't come all this way to see Melissa, did you?
Why don't we continue this over coffee?
Wren. I have a boyfriend now.
Fine. How about tea?
I don't remenber the thing from the night Ali died.
I woke up the next morning with this.
Here is the summary page.
What does it say?
Alison was buried alive.
Where's page five?
Look, here's page 1, 2, 3, 4... Page 6.
Where the hell is page 5?
Doctor Sullivan.
Can you get ahold of the other girls
and come to my office now?
I know who "A" is.
She's not here.
"The doctor is out.
A"
They've been like this since we brought them in here.
Haven't said a word.
You know, there's
probably a promotion in this for you.
You're right all along.
They're guilty.
And now we can prove it.
Did you miss me?
This isn't a little bad. It is bad.
Homicide is capital offence taken in Pennsylvania.
And you girls are going down.
Dr. Sullivan, are you home?
You've reached Anne Sullivan.
I've been called out of town on a family emergency.
If you need immediate attention,
please see your physician for a referral.
I got the same voicemail.
Yeah, she probably sent it to all of her clients.
She's not here.
Looks like she didn't come home last night either.
She hasn't checked her mail or picked up her papers.
Maybe we should call the police.
And say what to officer Garrett when he starts asking questions?
Hanna's right.
Garrett, Jenna, Ian, Jason--
they're all connected, and we can't trust any of them.
Look, the last time somebody thought she knew who "A" was,
she got hit by a car. Sorry, Hanna.
Okay, so what do we do?
We go into terror alert red
and hope that our phones don't ring.
That did not just happen!
It's Maya.
Look at you, suddenly all happy.
So, was it, like, nonstop "Just say no"
and sunset sing-alongs?
I will admit to knowing all the words
to "What a friend we have in Jesus,"
But I also met a lot of cool people there.
Cool like the Osmonds?
Go with the gold.
And cool like you don't end up at True North
because you're a conformist.
You know, I heard that they make you look at pictures...
Hanna, I love you,
but I haven't had a chance to talk to Maya...
Alone.
Oh, this is a date!
It's not a date.
It's not a date.
And I'm the clueless goober.
Okay, look, I'm really happy that you're back,
and I hope that we...
Okay, are those this season?
We'll... talk later.
Sure. And I hope the wedding goes better than the rehearsal.
Well, I can't imagine how it could be any worse.
It's sweet that you guys are going with her.
We've been through a lot together.
You have great friends.
I kind of think that's where we need to start again.
You... just want to be friends?
No. I'm not saying that.
So much has happened, and...
I don't know... this, Emily.
I-I think you'll like her.
I know I will, but...
I want to make sure she still likes me.
I want you to know that I'm thrilled you called me.
I should have called you first.
You should've.
But I forgive you.
Thank you. I'll pick it up in an hour.
What did the mechanic say?
The brake fluid was low.
What?!
How did that even happen?
You treat that truck like it's your baby.
The brake line was severed.
I probably backed over something at work.
You were just lucky you weren't on the highway.
If we had a real baby,
what would it look like?
I'm picturing a newborn with a six-pack.
Looks like Jason's taking down his window treatments.
He spends a lot of time in Alison's room.
Yeah, well, maybe he likes the view.
So, your dad didn't tell you anything about last night?
Why would your dad be over there?
Like I said, he just wouldn't tell me.
And that was the end of the conversation?
Yeah.
Spencer.
I know you.
When you want answers, you get them.
Yeah, well, you might know me,
But you don't know my dad,
And when he tells me to mind my own business,
that's what I do,
So can you just get over it?
I'm sorry.
It's just, that's who he is.
And you're okay with that?
Well, I don't have a choice.
I feel like we always have a choice.
The mailbox you were trying to reach is full.
You're early.
You're beautiful.
Okay, I want to see pictures,
I want to hear details, I want to--
Okay, I promise, I will relive the entire trip,
But right now what I want is for you to come here.
Thank you.
For what?
For being here.
Hanna, what's wrong?
Ask me what's right if you want a shorter answer.
I threw up on Isabel's dress.
My dad has never been more mad at me,
and after tonight,
Kate's gonna be my wicked stepsister for life.
And what's even worse
is I have to wear a dress that doesn't fit right.
I can't find the right bra,
which means I'm gonna have back fat.
You could be the skinniest person in the world and...!
Hanna, Hanna.
It reminds me of old times to see you like that.
I saw your car in the lot,
thought you might like to take a coffee break.
Oh, uh... are you working on your paper?
I really can't believe it's getting published.
The first time's overwhelming,
but I don't have to tell you that.
When I read your poems, I remember
how easy it was for me to fall in love with you.
Jackie, uh...
I'm seeing someone.
Of course you are.
You're a total catch.
I'm sorry I didn't realize that earlier.
But I wonder how things would be if we were both single.
But I'm not, so, uh...
I know. I get it.
To moving on.
To... to moving on.
I walked Toby outside.
And when I came back inside, it was here.
Here? Like, in the middle of your kitchen,
or here on your porch and you brought it inside?
I haven't touched it.
Guys, I never told you this,
but Dr. Sullivan really helped me.
Yeah, that was the reason that we trusted her.
She helped us all.
You don't think her ear's in here, do you?
It's a big box for an ear.
"You have until seven P.M. to save her.
"These are my demands."
Dolls?!
'kay...
Guess this is yours.
Wait.
Make Jackie go away.
Is there a creepier word than "Creepy"?
Wait, this is the paper Jackie's getting published
on Théodore... Géricault?
He's this French painter...
Who painted.
Yeah, in a word.
But A also gave you this French article on GéRICAULT,
and... it's identical to Jackie's paper.
She plagiarized this.
Stop the wedding.
Keep Toby safe.
Oh, my god.
Toby was driving his truck this morning
and his brakes went out.
That wasn't an accident. That was "A."
I didn't get one.
You've been "A's" target for weeks, Em.
Yeah. Maybe "A's" bored with you.
And I mean that as a good thing.
If "A" Wants to shut me up, she found a way to do it.
I mean, we finally tell someone the truth,
and now Dr. Sullivan's gone.
"A" can do that to anyone that we care about.
So we do these things, and "A" gives her back?
Is that what we're supposed to believe?
I get that this is a game,
but I don't understand it.
Spence.
No, it's brilliant, actually.
"A" is being our ultimate "Frienemy,"
forcing us to get what we want,
but knowing that when we do...
all hell breaks loose.
Believe me, I really want to get rid of Jackie,
but if I use this to do it,
Ezra may never forgive me.
There's a reason we can't just go around telling the truth:
'cause it comes back to bite you, hard.
Okay. We've got five hours
to obey our chucky dolls or...
I saw "A" Push Ian off that bell tower,
and there was no hesitation.
Spence, what are you saying?
She's saying that it felt
like it was easy for "A" To kill someone.
And I only know one way to keep Toby safe,
and that's to keep him away from me.
um
I didn't make a call before. I'd like to make it now.
I got the examiner's report,
and it's also missing page 5,
so I checked our case files in the computer system.
Sir, there's no record of page 5 anywhere.
What was on that page?
It was the analysis of the trace evidence
found on the victim's body.
You're telling me that every record of physical evidence
found on the deceased is gone?!
I made a terrible mistake, and I need you!
Looking for Mr. Fitz?
Wrong floor.
Who else knows about this? Does ezra?
No.
What do you want?
I think you need to leave Hollis.
Or?
I'm sorry I had to do this.
Do you have a plan yet?
Em, my dad was M.I.A. for two years,
and I thought I'd never forgive him for that,
but I have.
If I screw up this wedding, he's gonna leave again.
Have you talked to him since last night?
He talked to my mom.
Isabel had to buy a new dress.
I'll, um, meet you at the church, okay?
I'm sorry about last night.
I know.
And I'm sorry I put that much pressure on you
to make the toast.
This is gonna be an adjustment for everyone,
but... I think we can all find a way to get along.
One big happy family.
It can be,
If you accept it.
Dad, are you really sure you want to do this?
Look, I know that you and mom aren't perfect together,
but... I don't know, you were having so much fun here.
Your mom's a lot smarter than I am,
and she helped me realize
I was avoiding making this commitment,
but it's not because I don't love Isabel.
It's just, sometimes
when things are going really good for me,
I screw 'em up before someone else can.
I know. It doesn't make a lot of sense,
but it's a habit I'm trying to break.
So you really do love Isabel?
She makes me happy, kiddo.
Spencer.
You're scaring me.
You said it was important, but you're not talking.
It's because...
I know when you hear what I have to say...
you'll realize that I'm not the person you think I am.
No, that's not true.
I lied to you this morning.
My dad told me a whole lot more
than just to mind my own business.
I-I feel like we've been in this together with your family,
and with Jason too.
Yeah.
So what I don't understand is why you lied.
There's...
There's so much that you don't know.
And I can never tell you.
Don't you trust me?
I thought we felt the same way about each other.
Look, I found a way to survive my secrets,
but everybody that I care about gets hurt.
And you deserve to be with somebody who can be honest with you.
So, I'm sorry.
Spencer.
Spencer.
Wait!
You look beautiful.
Thanks.
So, how did it go?
Mike seems relieved,
and his therapist said he was really open to talking.
Good.
I'm sorry I asked you to lie.
You know I do try to do everything right,
and sometimes I just get it wrong.
Trust me, I understand.
Mike was starving,
So dad took him to Papa's Pizza.
That sounds like Mike.
So I'm going to go take a long, hot bath,
and pretend for one hour that I'm the perfect parent.
Mom.
We all get it wrong sometimes.
Oh, I got it.
What are you doing here?
Finishing what you started.
My mom's right upstairs.
Scary, isn't it, playing with fire.
You need to leave.
I made a huge mistake when I let him go.
Well, you're making an even bigger mistake being here right now.
That's not how I see it.
You and I are similar, Aria.
I guess that means Ezra has a type.
No, I really don't see any resemblance.
Actually, you're a lot like me.
We're both willing to do whatever it takes to keep him.
You don't have him to keep.
That's about to change.
I'm not leaving Hollis,
but you are leaving Ezra,
And if you mention this conversation
or my research material to anyone...
I suppose Ezra's young enough
to start over again somewhere else,
but the fallout of a student/teacher affair
has got to be a bitch.
You know that that would hurt him way more than me.
I don't want to hurt him...
But I will if I have to.
Cute dress.
Prepare to make a right turn.
That's weird.
Make an immediate right turn.
I'm taking you to her. Go alone.
Right turn, please.
On the record, yes, it was an anonymity
that led authorities to the suspects,
but that's all I can give you right now.
Okay, okay, come, let's go.
Officer, can you tell us what they were trying to hide?
Officer, was it a body?
Hey, I said move.
I should probably get going.
I was just thinking of the evening
you caught me sneaking a smoke.
Yeah.
You looked stunning...
And this is history repeating itself.
Thank you.
Not for the compliment, but for the ride home.
And listening to me,
I really don't ever let myself cry in front of anybody,
but you made it really easy.
Yeah, I often have that effect on women.
I've never actually known a guy who carried a hanky,
so... so I don't...
really know what the protocol is.
I don't know if you want me to wash it first or just...
Maybe you talked yourself out of the carpenter too soon.
None of us are perfect, Spencer.
We all come with baggage.
Yeah, well, the carpenter has a name.
And he would need a forklift
to maneuver through my tonnage of emotional debris.
You know, I'm actually certified to operate one of those.
No, I can't imagine you operating
any sort of heavy machinery.
Yeah, me neither. I made that up.
But I did get you to smile.
I really need to go.
Whoa. Here.
Thanks.
I know this is incredibly inappropriate for me to say,
but I'm desperate to kiss you.
I don't think that's a good idea.
I'm sure you're right.
I'm sorry, but I've been dying to do that.
You have terrible timing.
Amongst other things.
Hanna said that Emily left before she did.
Em, where are you?
I'm worried, Spence.
You're not alone.
They really do look happy.
Try to contain your enthusiasm.
Why so glum, Hanna?
Feeling a little hung?
I think your purse is ringing.
That's a very handsome suit.
And that is a very pretty dress.
But you should know it gives you back fat.
She's about to run out of air.
A
You have arrived at your destination.
Love one another, but not make a bond of love.
Let it be as a moving sea
Between the shores of your souls.
Fill each other's cup, but drink not from one cup.
Give one another of your bread...
...but eat not from the same loaf.
Sing and dance together and be joyous,
But let each one of you be alone,
Even as the...
Isabel?
Can I talk to you for a moment?
Uh, Hanna, whatever it is, it can wait.
Um, no, it can't, dad.
Let's go into the rectory.
What's this about?
I think Hanna's about to need a getaway car.
Yeah. Let's go.
When my dad came back to Rosewood,
He hooked up with my mom, and, um...
And "hooked up" Means that they slept together.
I know what it means.
Is this... true?
I'm sorry.
457 Grover Rd.
A
Dr. Sullivan?
No, no, no!
Hello!
Let me out!
Somebody let me out!
Somebody help me! Let me out!
You need to go home, boy. You have no reason to be here.
I'm not your boy and I am not about leaving,
You are in no position to argue.
Spencer!
I don't care what you can't tell me.
I care about you! I love you!
Do you hear me? I love you!
Spencer!
Spencer!
3 hours earlier.
It's ok. You're with me now.
Alison?
It's so good to see you, Emily.
I think I miss you the most.
Just rest.
It's what you need. Rest.
I never told you this, but...
You were always my favorite.
Nobody loved me as much as you did.
Is this what dying is?
That bitch thinks this is what you really want--
to be completely free of "A."
Do you know who "A" is?
Of course I do.
You have to tell me.
I don't think that's a good idea.
Why?
Because two can only keep a secret
If one of them is dead.
You have to decide what you want, Emily.
You can stay here...
Or you can come with me.
Sweet Emily.
Emily!
Emily!
Em, are you okay?
What happened?
She's still alive.
She was here.
Did you see Dr. Sullivan?
I saw Alison.
Em. Are you okay?
I haven't said a word to anyone.
They're... watching us.
What did the doctor say?
He gave me some oxygen. I'm fine.
I want to see my daughter,
And I want to see her now.
I understand, but I have to wait for the officer in charge.
Well, they're in custody, but they haven't been booked.
Well, yeah, I understand, but...
I have to call you back.
What the hell are you doing here?
Don't.
You need to stay away from this.
I think my sister would want me here.
Look...
This isn't just about me, all right?
It's about you.
I did things to protect you that you don't even know about.
My mother told me about the will, okay?
And you didn't need to do that.
I didn't kill Ali.
I never thought you did.
Jason, I have watched you grow up.
I've seen what you've gone through,
and I was honest with you last night
because I thought it would help.
No, you told me because I didn't give you a choice.
Why do you think I bought that house, huh?
I knew what I'd find.
Ali was great at keeping secrets,
but she was also great at punishing people with the truth.
Does she know?
No.
And she's not gonna find out tonight.
You shouldn't be here!
You blacked out.
Maybe you just don't remember getting the doors open.
That wasn't there before.
It's a set of latitude/ longitude coordinates.
北纬40°24' 西经75°17'8"
The text "A" sent me in the church
said she was about to run out of air.
Did "A" bury Dr. Sullivan alive?
Okay, I think we have to go left up here,
and then it's not much farther.
"Not much farther" in these heels
is like a marathon in flats.
Can't do it.
Here.
Wait. It says that this is it. We're here.
Uh... there's nothing here.
Guys.
Could she be under there?
She's still alive, but we should start digging!
Dr. Sullivan!
There's something down there!
Oh, my God! Her boots! Those are her boots!
Go! Fast!
Come on!
Dr. Sullivan!
What the hell--?
They are all here.
This is the police. Stay where you are!
"A" set us up!
Yeah, but for what?
There's nowhere to run!
Well, Veronica's in with them now.
She'll see that they're protected,
but they're gonna need a criminal attorney.
What's Ezra doing here?
Uh... why don't you hear Peter out?
I'll be right back.
Ella.
I know why you're here.
You need to understand that I...
Stop.
This is a very small town.
People see things, and they talk.
I actually thought you were an outstanding teacher.
I'm in love with her.
I'm gonna give you one chance to walk away from this.
Not because you deserve it,
but because this is the
last thing we need to deal with right now.
And when you go, you need to keep going,
because if Spencer's parents find out about this,
they will ruin you.
I thought Detective Wilden was fired.
He was suspended for his actions,
but he's been reinstated
as the chief officer in this investigation.
How could that happen?
He has evidence to back up his allegations.
And it's significant,
or you wouldn't be here.
Has anyone called my parents?
They're on their way.
We couldn't have come up with a better plan.
I wish I could see those bitches right now.
I'm sorry that they don't know that we're doing this to them.
Are you ready to give up your career in law enforcement?
I can't wait to get rid of this ridiculous uniform.
It's not smart for me to walk out of here tonight.
Well, you're much more patient than I am.
I've been waiting months to get into that storage room.
I think I can wait a little longer to quit the force.
Are you still worried about Jason?
You know, he's figured out that he's not the one that killed her,
but he's got no idea that we wrote that note.
And we're getting away with it.
When Alison DiLaurentis was muedered,
she was hit so hard, it made an indentation to her skull.
I've given you guys so many chances
to just be honest with me.
Evidence doesn't lie.
We've known all along what the murder weapon was.
Tonight we caught you with it.
Take this home.
And burn it.
Is it page 5?
It's over, Jenna.
There's nothing left
to link us to that night.
She deserved to die like that.
I've done everything you've asked me to do.
How are you doin' tonight, pretty eyes?
