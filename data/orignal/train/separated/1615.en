Arbiter is responsible for the death of Jack.
Justina Marks works for Arbiter.
You were having sex with your foster brother.
We're gonna fight this.
We can't because it's true.
Is Nick Stratos in school today?
I saw Nick, and he seemed really weird.
You said you weren't going to surprise me.
Nick's got a gun. We've got to lock down this school now.
Let's get everyone in the office.
Get those blinds. I need this table
in front of this door right now.
Let me in please. It... it's Mariana.
Get down! Get down!
We swept the entire school.
No sign of the Stratos kid anywhere.
So, where the hell is he?
How do you know Nick had a gun?
We don't know that.
His father owns one, and it's missing, so...
But that doesn't mean that Nick took it.
He burned down the warehouse.
Yeah, but do we know that for sure?
Why are you defending him?
Let... everybody, let's just please be
nice to each other, shall we?
So, did you talk to Nick?
I mean, he said he was looking for you.
Yeah.
So, what did he say?
Was he upset about something, or...
He saw me and mat in the garage last night.
Doing what?
Mat told me that he wanted to get back together with me,
but I told him no because I didn't want to hurt Nick.
So, why'd he freak out?
Because he saw us kiss goodbye.
Who kisses goodbye, Mariana?
I... I told Nick that I wasn't getting back together with Mat,
but he didn't believe me.
Yeah, I don't believe you either.
Jesus, enough.
No, did you see the way they ran into each other's arms?
Whose side are you on?
We're all on your side, honey.
Why did that teacher have a gun?
'Cause he's an idiot, that's why.
What happened to him?
He was... he was arrested.
Why were you in a 7th grade classroom?
Uh, well we... we were just in the hallway talking
when everything went down.
You don't think he'd come here... Nick, do you?
No, no. Absolutely not.
We've got the entire San Diego P.D. out there looking for him.
They're gonna find him very soon, okay?
So, in the meantime, we'll just stay put.
All right? Sit tight.
Keep all the doors locked just so we feel safe,
and I really don't want any of you guys
on your phones or computers, please.
Why not?
Because there's gonna be a lot of gossip
and misinformation out there,
and I don't want any of you to be a part of it.
And you know what? Just so you're not tempted,
why don't you give me your phones
and go upstairs and get your computers, please.
No, what are we gonna do without our phones?
Read a book.
Yeah, we read books on our phones.
Jesus, let's go.
Can we play computer games?
If you can somehow manage
to play them without computers, knock yourself out.
Mine's broken anyway. I dropped it in the toilet.
Post-flush.
You're supposed to put it in a bag of rice.
Got it. Thank you.
You guys, before you all head up to your rooms,
we're probably all still in some shock,
so if feelings come up later,
which I'm sure they probably will,
I want us to talk about it, okay?
No... no shutting down.
And to that end, no closed doors.
All right? I want all door open, please.
Even the bathroom doors?
No, Mariana, you can close those for privacy.
Now go ahead upstairs. Bring down your computers.
So, do you want to...
No. No, not right now, please.
Talk later.
Well, can I get my keyboard from the garage?
Yes, B, but I locked it,
so please make sure that you re-lock it behind you.
You okay?
Yeah.
You sure?
You really think it's necessary
to take their phones and computers?
What if Nick tries to get in touch
with Mariana or Jesus?
You don't think they would tell us?
I'm not gonna risk it.
Plus, with everything that's going around on Fost and Found.
How did Justina even find out about...
She didn't. She posted it,
and just assumed correctly, unfortunately.
Oh, what are we gonna do?
There's not much we can do
with everyone in the house right now, so...
I do want to let you know that I...
I asked for a car to be stationed outside tonight, okay?
So, you do think that he's gonna show up here...
Probably not.
But he is unstable,
and I want us to be prepared for anything.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Look, Stef... Stef said I could come up.
I hope... I hope it's okay.
Yeah.
I heard about the lockdown.
How you doing?
Fine.
You been on Fost and Found lately?
Yeah.
So, you know what people have been sayin'?
What have people been saying?
Y'all do know there's a drought going on, right?
We shouldn't be doing this.
We're not even supposed to be on our computers.
Our computers. They didn't say anything about A.J.'s.
无效的用户名或密码
Sorry.
I can't get in.
I figured.
This is not fair.
We created Fost and Found.
Justina has no right to lock us out.
It's okay.
It's not okay.
People are saying that you slept with your brother.
It's disgusting.
And Justina's monitors aren't letting anyone on to defend you.
I should head back.
She's trying to destroy your reputation.
It's over, okay? We lost Fost and Found.
There's nothing we can do about it.
Fine.
If you don't care.
Do you mind?
Look, it's none of my business
or anyone else's,
But whatever went down...
I saw how Brandon was with Cortney at his birthday.
And I know nothing's goin' on anymore.
I should've believed you.
I'm sorry.
Um, I just can't really think straight right now.
I know.
But, when you can...
I can't believe you guys
are making us watch a G-rated film
starring a worm.
It's hard to find a movie without guns.
Yes, or sex.
I love this movie.
Yeah, you would.
Okay, just because I didn't cut class to have sex in a car...
Mariana. You're grounded, by the way.
And that's different from this, how?
So, am I, like, the only one in this house not having sex?
You're 14.
Can we please watch the movie?
Yeah, who ate all the popcorn?
You did!
You did!
I will make more.
No, no, don't... don't leave me alone with them please!
No, no, no, you're on your own. I'll be right back.
Brandon!
What?
So, it true that you, you know, cut class to have sex?
Maybe.
And why do you assume that I'm not a virgin?
Wyatt.
Shut up!
Okay, if you guys aren't gonna watch this,
we can all just go up to bed.
It's up to you.
Jack?
I'm still in the system.
Nobody wants me.
Aren't you dead?
Have Moms said anything to you?
No, you?
I wish they'd just get this over with.
And then what?
We didn't do anything wrong.
Yes, we did.
We didn't tell them, we didn't give them a chance.
Chance to what?
Not adopt me.
Callie, they wouldn't have...
We don't know that.
They still can. They can reverse my adoption.
I looked into it. They can do it.
You have to stop thinking that nobody wants you.
This is different.
No, it's not.
Callie, they're not gonna un-adopt you.
They're not.
What's going on?
We were just talking.
Callie, go back to your room now.
Are we gonna talk about this?
We'll talk about it tomorrow.
No, no, Cortney's moving tomorrow. I'm helping her.
I don't care. You are not helping her.
She needs me. She doesn't have anyone else.
No one's leaving this house until Nick is found.
You can't keep us locked up in here.
You do not want to push me on this, Brandon.
Hey, what's... hey, what's going on?
I'm sorry, nothing. Nothing, honey, okay?
Go back to bed.
Okay?
Did you ever dream about your dad, after he died?
Yeah.
I remember this one where, um...
I was over at his house sitting in his living room,
we were watching a padres game.
And he asked me if I remembered the first time I saw snow,
which was at a padres/cubs game in chicago
he took me to when I was six.
And I had said to him,
"Why is there so much dust in the sky, Daddy?"
Yeah.
I had a dream about Jack.
He said that he was still in the system
and that nobody wanted him.
Do you ever think that dreams
are a way they try to talk to us?
No, no, I don't know what I think.
You know, that day that we buried Frank,
I went outside into the car and sat... sat in it to be alone,
and talk to him and tell him I loved him,
and that I forgave him.
And it started snow outside for real.
San Diego, California.
You think it was like a sign?
I, uh...
I like to think it was Frank
telling me that he loved me and forgave me, too, you know?
I'm sorry you've had so much loss in your young life.
I really am.
I love you, you know that.
And I love you, too.
Okay, get some sleep, baby.
Everything okay?
Yeah, I think the rats are up in the attic again.
Oh, great.
I'll have to check the traps tomorrow.
Come to bed.
Is that really necessary?
I certainly hope not.
I, um...
I found Callie in Brandon's room.
Doing what?
Talking, or so they say.
You think something else was going on?
No.
How are we ever going to be sure?
You know, from now on, every time they're alone,
are we gonna wonder and worry?
You think we're partly to blame
for leaving them alone in Idyllwild?
No, Mariana was with them,
had no reason not to trust them.
Sure as hell won't ever do that again.
Is that fair?
Yeah, I think so.
Honey, we're still a family.
I mean, honestly, what... what are we gonna do?
What can we do?
Well, we can't pretend like it didn't happen, yeah?
Honey, it's not happening now.
Are you sure about that?
I am, yes. I am.
Well... Things are never gonna be the same.
So it's different.
We'll figure it out like we do everything else.
But none of the other kids need to know.
In fact, I think it's important that they don't ever.
Well, I agree with you on that.
Are you awake?
Yeah.
Is it true?
When?
Up in Idyllwild.
You and Brandon...
Yeah.
Anything?
I've had a few calls from people
who think that they've spotted Nick in Escondido.
Oh, that's good.
You think we maybe can relax a little now?
Well, I think if he hasn't shown up by now,
he's not going to.
Especially in broad daylight.
But until they find him,
I want to keep a car stationed out front.
What are you doing?
Uh, I'm gonna check the rat traps.
You haven't heard them
scratching around up there again, have you?
No. Hey, why does Brandon get to leave the house?
He doesn't.
Well, the MINI's gone. Does someone else have it?
The hell?
Hey, Momma?
Yeah.
Do you think we could find out where Jack's buried?
I'm sure we could.
Do you want to visit his grave?
I think so.
I remember Mom saying something about him having an aunt.
I can try to find her phone number.
Thanks.
So, apparently Brandon got up this morning
to go help Cortney move,
after I distinctly forbade him from doing so.
Wait, forbade?
What are you doing?
I am texting him to get his ass back home.
You took our phones.
I'm just sayin'.
Can I go to volleyball practice?
It's at Mission Beach, so it's nowhere near school.
Yeah, just one of us is gonna have to drive you.
I can do it.
Awesome.
So we're safe now?
We all just have to stay alert, please.
No one goes out alone
and make sure that the doors are locked always.
Okay, but...
You know, when can we have our phones and computers back?
Soon, love. Soon.
Sorry, um, just grabbing my toothbrush.
I can go downstairs.
It's okay.
So, you haven't said two words to me since I told you.
I mean, I don't really know what to say.
Kind of makes me sick to think you and Brandon
in the cabin, when I was asleep.
But I have no room to talk.
I had sex on a beach with Wyatt at a school party.
At least you didn't cheat on anyone,
except maybe the family in a way.
I didn't mean to hurt anyone.
And it's totally over.
What did Moms say?
Haven't yet.
Well, at least we don't have to keep anymore secrets.
Some secrets should be kept.
Justina can't get away with what she's done.
We have to fight back.
How?
There's got to be something.
I, um... I took a picture of a check
Arbiter made out to Justina.
Well, that proves that she works for them.
I mean, and it makes her liable for Jack's death.
I mean, at least ethically.
This could really hurt her.
But how do we get it out there?
It's not like we can just post it on Fost & Found.
Well, we can't, but... Justina can.
Hello?
Hi, is this Linda Dawson?
Yes.
Hi, my name is Lena Adams Foster,
Um, and my son, Jude,
was friends with your nephew, Jack.
Hello?
I'm here.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Um... Anyway,
my son would like to visit Jack's grave
if... if you would be kind enough
to tell us know where he's buried.
Look, they called me to say they cremated the body
and I could pick up the ashes,
But it would cost me $400
and, well, I hardly knew the kid.
I ain't seen him since he was a baby
and I wasn't close to my sister.
I just don't know.
I don't got that kind of money right now.
I don't know what they done with him.
I'm sorry.
Honey?
Honey, are you up there?
Yeah!
Oh!
Sorry, sorry.
Did you find anything?
No.
The rat traps are empty.
There aren't any droppings. I mean,
I guess it could have been the wind.
Hey, can I ask you something?
Yeah.
Do you know what the coroner does
with remains that aren't claimed?
Well, after a certain time, they bury 'em.
Where?
Uh, I don't know, a mass grave somewhere.
Why?
Well, I was talking to Jude about, you know,
trying to find some place where...
And here I thought moving wasn't fun.
Well, now that we don't have to worry about
Eddie walking in on us.
Yeah, now all we have to do is worry about Mason.
I... I didn't mean that in a bad way.
I know.
He's a great kid.
So what's, uh, going on with you?
What do you mean?
Well, when we were having sex,
you seemed a little bit distracted.
Oh, so you didn't, uh...
Did you not...
No, I did.
You just, um, didn't really seem as with me.
I'm sorry.
I... I just think that, um...
Is it Nick?
You must be worried with him still out there.
Oh, no, I mean, they probably found him by now.
That must've been scary, the whole lockdown.
Yeah.
There you are.
Oh, my god.
So where is everyone?
Um, Lena and Jude went to drop Jesus at practice
and Stef's out somewhere.
Hello, my name's Andrew. How can I help you?
Hi, my name's Justina Marks.
I'm the chief admin officer on Fost & Found,
and I was hacked and I lost all my info, including my passwords,
so I can't get into my domain.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Uh, I can send a link to reset your password,
I just need to ask you a few security questions.
Great.
Mother's maiden name?
Wimberley.
Place of birth?
Evanston, Illinois.
No.
No? Um...
Are you sure? I mean, that's where I was born.
Oh, not you, your mother's place of birth.
Oh, right, sorry.
Uh, yeah, it's Piggott, Arkansas.
Great. Last question, favorite pet's name?
Um... Uh, sorry, I have so many pets.
Oh yeah, what do you have?
Um, I have a cat and a dog, um...
I have a bird, um, a fish.
Um, and a snake.
You have a snake?
Yep.
Buttons.
Sorry, not the snake.
髯毛小猎狗
The schnoodle.
Aww. What's your snake's name?
Snakey.
So cute.
Okay, I'll send the link to your email, jmarks@jmi.Vox.
Actually, um, no,
Just 'cause I was hacked,
could you send it to my assistant's email?
It's jp123@mymail.Vox.
Okay, will do.
Great, thank you so much.
Uh-huh.
Snakey the snake?
I don't know what you name a snake, okay?
You are pretty adorable when you're under pressure.
Okay, try to control yourselves until I do this,
then I'll leave you alone.
What exactly are you doing, and am I gonna get arrested
for letting you hack somebody on my computer?
We're not hacking anyone.
We're simply re-routing all of the traffic from Fost & Found
to a website called Justice For Jack.
I made up the name.
Of course, it's not as good as snakey the snake.
And what's on Justice For Jack?
A copy of the check that Arbiter wrote to Justina.
You know, the for-profit organization
that had Jack placed with Pearson
and got him killed.
And how'd you get this check?
I would rather not say.
What if they trace this back to you guys?
They won't. I'm using an anonymizer.
And we're gonna send the link
to every lawmaker in San Diego county and Sacramento
to kill Justina's bill.
All right.
All I have to do is press "Return."
Do it.
So now what?
Now we wait and see.
Well, I'm exhausted.
I'm gonna try to take a nap.
Hey, thank you.
No problem.
How'd you find me?
The address from your desk.
I can't believe you went through my things.
I can't believe that you blatantly disobeyed me.
Disobeyed? I'm not a kid anymore.
18 does not make you an adult, Brandon.
I can vote.
Any idiot can vote.
And as long as you are eating my food under my roof,
you will obey my rules.
She wasn't adopted yet.
Okay, I'm gonna not talking about this here.
No, mom, I'm sorry. We made a mistake.
But we are not real brother and sister.
Oh, well, what about Jesus and Mariana?
Are they not your real brother and sister?
No, no, that's different. We grew up together.
Callie's only been living with us for like a year.
Okay, I'm not gonna listen to this, B.
Right, 'cause you never listen.
Okay.
Just like when I try to tell you that I was in love with Callie,
you took out a restraining order.
Yes, which you apparently violated several times.
Did you not...
This is why we don't tell you anything,
because we knew you would never understand.
What's to understand, Brandon?
That you had sex with your foster sister?
Doesn't matter that she wasn't adopted yet.
It was wrong.
That's why you didn't come to us, because it was wrong.
You knew it and you were scared.
Yeah, we were scared.
Yeah.
We were scared to hurt the family.
Oh, come on.
We gave up everything we felt for each other to protect you.
You deceived us. You deceived us, Brandon.
There is no excuse for that.
And I hold you mostly responsible
because Callie was vulnerable
and you, of all people, should have known better.
Now, go get the rest of your stuff and get home, please.
You know, okay.
I take full responsibility.
For everything.
But I'm not coming home.
Okay. Well, that's great.
Then what are you gonna do, B?
Are you gonna go live with your dad again?
That went really well the first time.
No, Mom, I'm gonna live here with Cortney.
You might not think I'm an adult yet,
but legally, I can live wherever I want.
Okay.
Well, good luck with that.
Don't scream, don't scream.
Don't scream. Okay? Just don't be scared.
Don't be scared. I just wanna talk to you.
I've been waiting to talk to you,
so, uh, just, um...
A.J., is Mike here?
Uh, no.
Uh, I just... I borrowed his car.
And I should be going
because he actually has to get to work tonight.
So I'll talk to you later?
I hope you weren't on Fost and Found.
Why?
Because we took your computers away for a reason.
What's in there?
Jack's ashes.
I need you to understand why.
Okay?
Why... why I can't, um... why I can't because...
there's too many voices in my head.
I can't, uh, think straight
because they won't stop talking.
And I hate it, and I hate everything.
I hate myself, and I... I hate you.
You know? I hate you.
What are you going to do with them?
I... I don't know.
Do you think we could bury them under Frankie's tree?
Jude...
Oh, no, that's okay.
Um, I think that would be a lovely idea, honey.
Hey, where have you been?
Uh, do you think you guys could give us a minute alone, please?
Sure.
Okay.
What's the matter?
Apparently, Brandon has decided
that he's moving in with Cortney.
Did you go over there?
Stef?
I need to do something
to make the hurt go away.
You know, I can still hear the snap of his belt.
Snap.
I would beg him not to hit me,
and you know what he would say?
He would say, "This is gonna hurt me
a lot more than it's gonna hurt you."
I mean, what?
He humiliated me...
like you did.
Please, don't hurt me.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
No, Nick, don't.
Were you scared during the lockdown?
Yeah. Were you?
I texted Connor.
I mean, that's okay.
I miss him.
I know.
I miss Jack, too.
Why do bad things keep happening?
Nick, don't.
Please, don't hurt yourself.
Why? Why, huh?
I'm all alone, I have no one.
You have me.
No, I don't.
Yes, you do.
You have me.
No, I can't. I can't.
Yes, you can. You can.
You just have to put the gun down.
What did you expect?
You practically dragged him out of his girlfriend's bed.
He was embarrassed.
He should have been.
I hope it's Brandon.
He has a key.
Hey, look, look, look, I'm still wearing your necklace.
Why I be wearing it if I didn't want to be with you?
What about Mat, huh? You don't love him?
No, I... I don't.
I love you.
Hey.
Hi, Stef.
Is Mariana home?
Uh, yeah, she is.
I just want to check in after yesterday,
see if she's okay.
Um, sure.
She's, uh... she's upstairs in her room.
Go ahead.
Thanks.
At least he's not in the system anymore.
I'm sorry about what I said,
that you lie about a lot of things.
I know it's not true.
No, it's okay.
It's not too late. Okay? I promise,
we can still be together.
Please, don't hurt yourself.
Mat, don't go in there.
Go get Stef. Go get Stef.
Well, I burned down the warehouse,
so, they're gonna send me to jail anyway.
Your dad wouldn't let that happen.
He doesn't care about me!
He doesn't... he doesn't care about me.
Okay? I... I can't...
I need it to stop.
It will stop if we're together.
But we can't be together if you hurt yourself.
So please... Don't leave me alone.
Don't break my heart.
I need you.
Please, just... just... just come sit with me.
Nick's in there.
Go in there.
Mariana.
Okay, it's okay now, Nick, it's all over.
Mariana, come with me.
No, no, no, let her come with me
and you're gonna be fine.
Just let her come with me. It's gonna be all over.
You okay?
I'm okay.
Go find Momma. Go.
Okay.
You go find Momma.
Gonna be okay now, Nick.
It's all over, okay? It's all over.
Nick!
Hey. Are you okay?
I thought he was gonna shoot me.
And then he put the gun to his head.
I'm so sorry.
What... what if he shot himself,
like, right here in my room?
I mean, how did you...
What did you say to him?
I... I don't know. I...
I just kept talking.
And then he cried in my arms.
He's so sad.
Come here.
You're okay.
It's okay.
I want to get an alarm.
I want to get bars on the windows.
Whatever it takes to make us safe.
Honey, we are fine. Okay? We're fine.
What are we gonna to do about Callie?
Now you have a home.
