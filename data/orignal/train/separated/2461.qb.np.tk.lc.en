she has elena .
and i &apos;m the only one who knows where she is .
oscar &apos;s been gone days running your errands .
while we &apos;re stuck here .
starving ourselves ,
pretending like we &apos;re not the strongest people on the planet .
i don &apos;t want to be a part of lily &apos;s cavalry .
i just want to have fun .
you will not lay a hand on another member of my family .
give me elena , you &apos;ll get your son back .
once you bury the body ,
the grieving process begins .
well , i &apos;m not planning on burying her .
the phoenix stone brings people back from the dead .
tell me you &apos;ll try .
i &apos;ll try .
what was the deal with you and stefan ?
i was the first love of stefan &apos;s life .
you put that spell on me so stefan couldn &apos;t touch me .
it &apos;s like your skin is vervain .
stefan , meet julian .
julian was the man you are not supposed to fall for .
does stefan salvatore know that you are pregnant with his child ?
so have you found julian yet ?
i found him months ago .
julian is the devil .
i can &apos;t let lily bring him back .
oh , damn it !
is it fixed yet ?
not yet , sweetheart ,
and it &apos;s past your bedtime .
no !
yes , it is . you want to brush your teeth ?
no !
yeah ? well , too bad .
surgery will have to resume tomorrow .
all right , josie . help your sister find her pjs , ok ?
girls ?
damon .
well , aren &apos;t you adorable ?
you girls , too .
stay behind daddy .
why so gloomy ?
looks like you got everything you wanted .
the fact that you &apos;re here means somebody died .
no , not yet ,
but if you don &apos;t do exactly as i say ,
that could change real fast .
so ...
you gonna invite me in ?
jeez .
you &apos;re here at 5 a.m.
i &apos;m gonna need the place to myself today ..
oh , come on , man .
don &apos;t make me an accomplice to whatever weird stuff
you &apos;re doing with your wife &apos;s dead body .
you have no idea how weird it &apos;s gonna get .
is this enough to buy some privacy ?
i &apos;m gonna throw in a free reality check .
preserved bodies still have an expiration date ,
and this is her last day .
she doesn &apos;t have to go home , but she can &apos;t stay here .
mother , tell me you have elena .
let me speak to oscar .
no can do . i &apos;m about to wake him up
from his little vervain nap .
you do realize that when you get her back
you &apos;re not actually getting her back , right ?
she &apos;s still in a box .
do you think i need to be reminded of that ?
and yet you &apos;re leveraging a member
of my family just to get her body closer to you .
how selfish can you be ?
spare the lecture , mommy .
damon , if you have harmed oscar in any way ...
yeah , yeah , yeah . say good @-@ bye to elena .
it &apos;s not my first hostage swap .
oscar .
oscar ?
i can smell the blood on you , buddy .
you got to be kidding me .
i didn &apos;t want to wake you .
well , i would lose more sleep
if you just snuck out without saying hi .
oh , i missed this .
am i gonna catch fire ?
no ! i just can &apos;t touch vampires .
valerie basically turned my skin into vervain .
i &apos;ll work on unraveling the spell when i can .
stop . we have so much to catch up on .
let &apos;s just go shopping for halloween costumes ,
and we can worry about magic later .
well , i &apos;m kind of already worrying about magic today .
alaric thinks we can reunite jo &apos;s spirit
with her body by using some sketchy
native american resurrection stone .
my job is to crush his dreams
in the most gentle way possible .
ok . you don &apos;t even think it will work ?
i don &apos;t think it should .
the other side is gone .
there &apos;s no more gemini prison world ,
which means that jo &apos;s spirit is probably at peace .
our lives are weird .
tell me about it .
how the hell did you let this happen ?
don &apos;t even think about blaming this on me .
i &apos;m not the one that unscrewed his heart .
no . you &apos;re just the one who chased him down ,
kidnapped him , and are still technically holding him hostage .
to get elena back .
and how &apos;s that working out for you ?
because from where i &apos;m standing ,
she &apos;s in more danger than ever
because you won &apos;t let her rest .
you spend one day with mommy dearest ,
and now you &apos;re on her side ?
i don &apos;t have to be on her side
to see what &apos;s happening here .
you can &apos;t be with elena ,
so you &apos;re making all your bad decisions about elena .
we need to get rid of this body .
no , no , no . you need to get rid of this body .
breakkie . what are we having ?
mushroom omelettes .
they &apos;re for oscar , not you .
he &apos;s coming home today .
i &apos;m impressed , especially considering
how late you got home last night .
where &apos;s oscar ?
i don &apos;t know . damon never showed up .
i suppose i &apos;ve taken the notion of trust for granted lately .
lorenzo , would you mind terribly
if i had a moment alone with valerie .
is something wrong ?
just some family business .
i spent yesterday with stefan ,
learned all about your little tryst in 1863 .
we were children . it was ...
it was puppy love .
it meant nothing .
right .
that explains why you held onto his journal all these years .
you were fragile at the time .
i didn &apos;t want to upset you .
you told him you were coming back for him ,
and he believed you .
why put him through that ?
i was a foolish human back then .
i &apos;m sorry .
i will only say this once .
if you have anything to tell me ,
anything at all ,
now is the time .
i have nothing to hide .
i should go look for oscar .
that won &apos;t be necessary .
god , it feels good to come out of that deserted town
and be around living , breathg people we can eat .
mystic falls is the prison world all over again .
we &apos;re on a mission , nora ,
not a vacation .
all right .
damon ? i know you &apos;re here .
open up .
damon , open the--
hello .
hello .
university housing .
how lovely .
how sad .
not as sad as being exiled here
by your own mother .
lily must have had the wrong address
for the hostage exchange .
where &apos;s oscar ?
you just missed him .
you reek of blood .
well , i &apos;ve been-- i &apos;ve been binging .
and i &apos;ve been judging .
not gonna find him in there .
look . i get it . ok . you got me .
oscar turned the tables ,
and he knocked me out ,
and he took off .
i lost my one and only bargaining chip .
then why isn &apos;t oscar answering his phone ?
maybe the guy doesn &apos;t want to be found .
why don &apos;t i believe you ?
well , this is pointless .
come , nora .
i &apos;ll throw that away for you .
screw it . let &apos;s just get this guy to the furnace .
uh , wrong door , darling .
ok .
&quot; a message from miss nora hildegard ,
dictated but not read .
for every hour that oscar isn &apos;t returned ,
a whitmore student will die ,
starting now . &quot;
no .
with dozens of disappearances
and a history of animal attacks ,
mystic falls was the subject of supernatural speculation
even before the quote unquote &quot; mining fire evacuation . &quot;
we &apos;re not doing anything illegal , officer .
besides violating a town @-@ wide quarantine
and putting these people &apos;s lives at risk
to make a quick buck ?
pack it up and get out of here .
we both know there &apos;s no real danger here .
it &apos;s just an empty ghost town .
really ?
you hear about the noises in the old boarding house ?
the mysterious figure haunting the clock tower ?
tell your ghostbusters to charge up their proton packs .
they &apos;ve hit the proverbial jackpot .
get out of here unless you want your license suspended .
now .
come on . let &apos;s go .
if you touch any of these people ,
i will shoot you right here .
don &apos;t waste the ammunition , mate .
waste of taxpayer money ,
and i am one of your last taxpayers .
what do you want , enzo ?
oh , god . just a good night &apos;s rest ,
which is proving difficult lately
with all the late night sneaking
in and out of the salvatore house .
vamp hearing &apos;s bad enough ,
but once the heretics start creeping ,
that &apos;s when i really lose sleep .
there &apos;s an abandoned music shop down the way .
i &apos;ll let you steal a tiny fiddle .
or you could grant me access
to the town surveillance cameras .
have a heretic to track .
brought you coffee .
oh , and he keeps getting better .
sorry !
it &apos;s ok . no contact .
it &apos;s not your fault .
i take it your charm didn &apos;t work
on getting valerie to undo the spell .
uh , i haven &apos;t spoken to her yet .
so you &apos;re avoiding ?
no . there &apos;s nothing to avoid .
well , stefan , she was your first love ,
and then she just left you hanging .
you &apos;re not the least bit curious why ?
she hasn &apos;t contacted me in the 4 months she &apos;s been back ,
so i &apos;m assuming she &apos;s as over it as i am .
yeah , but that is quite an assumption
considering that she &apos;s the reason why
i literally can &apos;t touch you .
unfortunately , she &apos;s the heretic
that i am the least concerned about right now .
oh , god . who now ?
let &apos;s just say that it involves
two bored mean girls on a campus full of easy targets ,
but fortunately , i have come up
with a genius plan to keep them occupied
while damon sorts out his oscar problem .
the dance .
full of potential victims .
and distractions all in one place .
easy to baby @-@ sit .
i think the hardest part will be feigning enthusiasm .
yeah . they &apos;ll never fall for it .
unless they think it &apos;s their idea .
i &apos;m getting hungry .
is it death o &apos;clock yet ?
we still have 13 minutes .
what &apos;s this ?
oh , nothing . it &apos;s just some silly heaven and hell ball .
stefan invited me , but i don &apos;t know .
these days , halloween just seems like an excuse
to get drunk and show skin .
sorry . no heretics allowed .
halloween &apos;s only for people who dress up as psychopaths .
as if we &apos;d want to drink cheap beer out of plastic
and then brag about it all over the internet .
as if you &apos;d even know how to do that .
we &apos;re going .
to a college party ?
oh , ok .
ok . good luck with that .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
nothing . no . you two will fit in just fine .
seriously , you guys have nothing to feel
self @-@ conscious about .
did i say you could leave ?
what do you want ?
i see you found a dress from my closet .
haven &apos;t been to a party since new year &apos;s 1902 .
be honest .
will i make a proper modern devil ?
shouldn &apos;t be too much of a stretch .
unlike the hips of that dress .
would you prefer i chose a different one
and dyed it with your blood ?
look .
i gave you an outfit .
now it &apos;s your turn .
siphon off this annoying antivampire spell .
are you prohibited from showing physical affection
for your significant other .
try being gay in 1900 .
what do you care about some silly spell ?
you don &apos;t even like valerie .
you &apos;re right . i don &apos;t .
i &apos;ve had to endure two lifetimes
with that conniving shrew ,
and i &apos;ve learned that when it comes to val
you don &apos;t get on her bad side .
not happening , stefan .
look . if i siphon caroline &apos;s spell , valerie will find out ,
and she &apos;ll retaliate with something much worse .
the girl is a rancid bitch .
that &apos;s not the valerie that i knew .
well , i used to be a sickly , abused , little urchin
cast out by my coven ,
and then i met mary louise .
love changes people .
i mean , maybe valerie &apos;s obsession with you
is the reason why she &apos;s a walking funeral dirge .
oh , nora
well ?
not bad .
not bad is not good .
no , you look nice . it &apos;s just ...
kind of plain ,
but i can sex it up for you .
i &apos;m comfortable like this , nora . don &apos;t .
stop it !
oh , come on . you &apos;re supposed to be a devil .
you want a devil ?
it &apos;s 15 minutes past the hour .
distraction period over .
mary lou .
wait !
well , what better way to spend halloween , huh ?
well , why would i want to go to some
stupid halloween party like a normal student ,
maybe meet a nice guy or not so nice guy ,
have a fun , drunk halloween hookup
when i can be here ,
struggling to raise the dead ?
well , if it makes any difference ,
this is worth some serious extra credit .
oh , you think ?
whether or not i &apos;m capable ,
you &apos;re lucky i &apos;m willing ,
and the visions from that stone scare the hell out of me ,
so don &apos;t ...
rush me .
well , that &apos;s too bad
because we got to bring this guy back to life .
now .
nice costume for two hours &apos; notice .
oh , thank you .
you weren &apos;t , oh , i don &apos;t know ,
already coming to this and just , uh ,
forgot to invite me ?
i didn &apos;t forget to invite you .
i just felt like a halloween party
wasn &apos;t great first date material .
so then this isn &apos;t our first date ?
well , it depends .
what do you think it is ?
torture .
oh , they &apos;re here .
guess it &apos;s time for us to baby @-@ sit .
hi , girls . what can i get you ?
a bijou for me and a crème yvette for my little flower here .
i &apos;m sorry . i have no idea what that is .
a gin martini and a sex on the beach .
gotcha .
so let me guess .
old @-@ fashioned devil
and slutty angel .
i love it .
beg your pardon ?
thanks . it &apos;s culled together
with stuff i found on pinterest .
oh , my god . pinterest . i love pinterest .
get half my recipes from it .
i &apos;m obsessed .
obsessed .
phesmatos exaud mi , conjug spiritis et corpe .
phesmatos exaud mi ,
conjug spiritis et corpe .
scratch that one off the list .
you &apos;re not the only one banking on this .
it &apos;s not for me , ric .
why does everything have to be about me today ?
will both of you just shut up ?
the stone works .
i think it &apos;s creating a bridge
between the body and the spirit .
i just have to find a spell
that makes that bridge permanent .
so how goes the diversion ?
3 . that &apos;s the number of people caroline and i have saved ...
barely .
so did you call just to brag ?
how much longer ?
oh , crap ric , put it out . !
think we &apos;re close .
there &apos;s the mopey face
i &apos;ve come to know and love .
i guess all it takes is a scolding from lily
to ruin breakfast .
we have an ice box full of blood downstairs , you know .
yeah , but sometimes , it &apos;s nice to get out of the house ,
take a drive ,
get out of town , come back .
wouldn &apos;t you agree ?
clearly i &apos;m not as quick as the other orphans in the workhouse .
are you accusing me of something ?
town surveillance has you on the road
to and from whitmore last night in a stolen car .
curious how oscar was also at whitmore last night
and has since mysteriously disappeared ,
so--heh--yes , i am accusing you of something .
i &apos;m just not sure whether it &apos;s lying to lily or murder
or both .
forget everything you think you know
because you are wrong in ways
you cannot even imagine .
enlighten me .
what exactly don &apos;t i know ?
well , maybe it &apos;s easier if i just ask lily ,
and i &apos;m sure she &apos;ll be eager to uncover the truth
and punish you for it .
i killed oscar .
he knew too much .
i had to prevent him from bringing
a monster back into lily &apos;s life .
what monster is that ?
julian .
you don &apos;t know .
i guess lily doesn &apos;t tell you everything .
who &apos;s julian , valerie ?
someone you &apos;ll want to keep as far away as possible ,
assuming that one day you want lily to love you
in the same way that you love her .
do you think they forgot
they came here to murder people ?
oh , no . they &apos;re just wrapped up in their own drama .
see , nora wants some breathing room ,
but mary louise is scared if she gives it to her
then nora &apos;s gonna leave her .
you got all that from that ?
well , it &apos;s obvious .
or not .
you know , i &apos;d ask you to dance , but ...
but i &apos;d kill you .
how convenient .
if only there was a person that you could talk to about it .
i will ask valerie to undo it
once damon brings oscar back to life .
so you &apos;re not technically avoiding .
you &apos;re just waiting for damon to raise the dead .
ok .
caroline , valerie &apos;s been dead to me
for 150 years .
well , she &apos;s back now ,
and you &apos;re scared that you &apos;re gonna look her in the eye
and all of your feelings are gonna come back ,
you know , the infatuation
and the abandonment and the whole freaking fairytale .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m scared of ,
or that &apos;s what you &apos;re scared of ?
it can be both .
god . you know what ? i &apos;m just too sober
to be talking about this .
nora ...
where did you go ?
i &apos;m just tipsy enough to enjoy this music .
have a taste .
she &apos;s been sneaking tequila ,
so she &apos;s a little spicy .
what the hell ? !
oh , don &apos;t act so shocked .
oh , don &apos;t pretend that was anything other than petty jealousy .
this trashy girl wouldn &apos;t mean a damn thing to you
if you weren &apos;t so desperate for attention !
attention ? how could i possibly want attention
when you &apos;ve been perched on my shoulder
every second for the last 120 years ?
oh ! am i ruining your fun ?
&quot; stay close , nora . slow down , nora . &quot;
as if it &apos;s still the bloody 19th century
and i need your protection !
i &apos;m not the one struggling to adapt , mary lou .
you are !
very well .
do whatever you want .
i &apos;m going to finish what we came here to do .
ababbas dagoinet mateesah elunatan .
oshawas melunaweh washaset zagoedan .
well , which one was that ?
it &apos;s something i found in one of your shamanistic oral traditions .
oh , my god .
bonnie ...
you are officially the most terrifying person i know .
easy there , buddy .
where am i ?
you &apos;re on your way to mystic falls .
virginia ? how did i get here ?
well , we &apos;ll talk about it on the way .
smile for mommy .
yeah ! ok .
blood . i need blood .
figured you might .
either our friend still has the munchies ,
or this ravenous hunger is a side effect of resurrection .
don &apos;t look at me .
i barely understand how the guy &apos;s alive .
if hunger is the worst consequence
of the stone spell , then we got off easy .
are you sure you want to do this to jo ?
listen . it &apos;s now or never , damon .
no offense , ric , but i was asking bonnie .
look at you sad sacks .
what , am i gonna say no ?
damon , go get your girl .
i &apos;ll get his .
trick or treat ?
i &apos;ve been tricked enough today .
i still haven &apos;t heard a peep from the girls since they left .
who &apos;s julian ?
where did you hear that name ?
i &apos;ve heard a lot of names in this house since i moved in ,
but julian , that &apos;s a new one ,
which means your family isn &apos;t talking about him for a reason .
well , that &apos;s nonsense .
no one who ever met julian would dare say a bad thing about him .
he was a saint .
he was the love of my life .
was ...
or is ?
damon found oscar !
get out of my way .
why ? you &apos;re done here .
oh . that &apos;s excellent news .
where &apos;s nora ?
i don &apos;t know .
we had a fight .
i &apos;m sorry .
do not pity me !
trust me , i don &apos;t .
is this how relationships work in the modern era ,
everybody peddling their flesh like a street bazaar ?
because bloody nora seems quite interested in the browsing .
you know , these days , they have this wonderful thing
called a therapist .
how old do you think i am ?
i could think of nothing more futile that prattling on about one &apos;s emotions .
as if i can prevent nora from drifting away
if i only find the right words .
or as if confronting my first love
will somehow make her disappear .
caroline thinks that valerie &apos;s mere existence
is somehow sabotaging our relationship ,
but if she could just get into my head ,
she would see that the only thing
standing between me and my girlfriend
is that damn spell ...
which you can remove .
i got you .
can you--can you slow down , please ?
trust me . you do not want to make lily wait .
i learned that the hard way .
here . this will take the edge off .
i &apos;m gonna need more .
not till we get our story straight .
we were in myrtle beach , we were wasted .
you passed out .
i &apos;ve never been to myrtle beach .
how deep does this amnesia go ?
i just need a little more , ok ?
just--just a taste , a drop .
well , that was the last one .
well , then you &apos;re gonna have to stop this thing !
not until you get one right .
multiple choice . you were in myrtle beach--
a , partying too much ; b ...
don &apos;t shoot the one person who can solve this case for you ,
detective dumbass .
oscar &apos;s acid trip went from bad to worse .
i &apos;ve been tracking him through the woods .
damon , it &apos;s halloween .
there &apos;ll be ghost tours going through mystic falls every 30 minutes .
perfect . at least i know where he &apos;s going .
i &apos;m coming with you .
donavan , that badge does not take away the fact
that you are human .
please don &apos;t commit suicide by heretic tonight .
since when do you care ?
give me a break .
i don &apos;t want to add your death to a long list
of things that are already my fault .
mar ? mary lou ?
you can &apos;t avoid me for--
siphon the repulsion spell off of caroline ,
or your girlfriend dies .
do you see how easy i made that for you ?
yes . thanks . now let me make it harder for you .
get away from her !
grab my arm and siphon or keep burning .
did it work ?
well , that was a lot more satisfying than i thought it would be .
any questions before we head to the final stop on our tour ?
yeah . so when does this get scary ?
hey ! this isn &apos;t some haunted hayride , ok ?
if you want teenagers dressed up in silly costumes
giving you jump scares , go to grove hill .
oscar , enough !
what on earth has gotten into you ?
oscar , you are not yourself when you feed .
you know that .
you remember how we live .
you remember--everything in moderation !
now i get it .
your favorite sons are the ones with the ripper problems .
i highly recommend a detox
and an intervention .
now it &apos;s your turn .
where the hell &apos;s elena ?
where are they ?
it doesn &apos;t matter .
of course it matters .
they were going to hurt you !
i &apos;m going to find them and rip their heads off
and smash them together like two disgusting melons and--
why are you smiling ?
i can &apos;t help it .
you &apos;re adorable .
i &apos;m sorry .
you were right to worry .
no . i &apos;m sorry .
we &apos;ve been on our own , scorned , abused ,
imprisoned for so long .
i &apos;ve forgotten that this world is meant to be enjoyed ,
not feared .
help me remember .
we should get back to mystic falls .
we &apos;ve spent an entire lifetime there .
the night is ours .
no ! wait , wait , wait . this can &apos;t happen yet !
yes , it can . that &apos;s the whole point .
no ! i need you to know that i am not
some insecure , jealous girlfriend , ok ?
it &apos;s just when i get something
that i &apos;ve wanted for a really long time ,
sometimes i do this thing--
you overthink things . yeah , i know .
yeah , but sometimes , i say things that i don &apos;t really need to say ,
but i &apos;m just scared that i &apos;m the only one thinking them .
the reason that i &apos;m not talking about valerie
is because i &apos;m not thinking about valerie .
i &apos;m thinking about you
and how you and i have had more history
in the last 5 years
than most people have in a lifetime .
this is off limits to--
you &apos;re one of the heretics .
yep . don &apos;t do anything stupid .
right now , there &apos;s a tour bus full of corpses
in the cemetery because i didn &apos;t do anything stupid .
well , i &apos;m in danger of being exiled from my family
because i did something extra stupid .
join me for a drink ?
if you &apos;re not gone by the time i count to 3,
i &apos;ll shoot you right now .
1 ...
2 ...
stick to tourists .
you &apos;re welcome .
i &apos;m swooning on the inside .
in case it &apos;s not entirely obvious by now ,
i came here to be alone .
or you &apos;re planning your escape .
only a matter of time before oscar sobers up
and fingers you as his would @-@ be murderer ,
which clearly you &apos;re bloody awful at .
what do you want , enzo ?
i want , dear , not so innocent valerie ,
for you to tell me how we &apos;re going to prevent julian
from walking back into lily &apos;s life .
i &apos;ve asked beau to remove the cloaking spell from elena &apos;s coffin .
you &apos;re find her in the ruins of the old salvatore mansion .
clever ... ish .
i do think so .
i &apos;m moving back to mystic falls .
i will certainly ask the family to take it under consideration .
it wasn &apos;t a request .
these people didn &apos;t deserve to be killed
by one of your free range children ,
stefan &apos;s up to his hero hair in heretic drama ,
and i worry that matt donovan &apos;s funeral
is gonna cut into my social schedule .
and , what , you &apos;re gonna help keep order ?
damon , you could hardly keep a covered box safe .
you do realize that this innate desire
to keep elena physically present in your life ,
this boyish refusal to let her go
will only put her in more danger ?
after everything you &apos;ve been through ,
what a shame it would be to lose her
because you &apos;re too terrified to find out
who you actually are without her .
if you dare to return to mystic falls ,
it &apos;s no skin off my nose .
i want one more thing .
&quot; dear elena , yes , you heard that correctly .
&quot; hell has frozen over .
&quot; i &apos;m writing it all down .
&quot; granted , i &apos;m a half bottle in
&quot; thanks to my 1950 chateau cheval blanc ,
&quot; a bottle i waited 65 years to open . &quot;
&quot; i used to spend nights sitting in my wine cellar ,
&quot; convincing myself i could actually hear it age ,
&quot; tannins growing , fermenting ,
&quot; but appreciating its beauty
&quot; didn &apos;t make the time go by any faster .
&quot; the bottle just laid there on its shelf , torturing me ,
&quot; while i waited for katherine ,
&quot; and time stood still .
&quot; eventually , i convinced myself that no sip of that wine
&quot; could ever taste as good as i dreamt it would ,
&quot; so i hid the bottle and walked away ,
and that &apos;s the story of why i drink bourbon . &quot;
&quot; i don &apos;t know who i am without you ,
&quot; but i do know that as long as i &apos;m with you
time will stand still . &quot;
&quot; so who is damon salvatore without elena gilbert ? &quot;
&quot; a selfish friend ... &quot;
&quot; a jealous brother ... &quot;
&quot; a horrible son ? &quot;
&quot; or maybe with a little luck , i &apos;ll do right by you
&quot; because you may be 1,000 miles away
&quot; or 100 years away ,
&quot; but you &apos;re still here with me ,
and my heart is right there in that coffin with you ... &quot;
&quot; until you come back to me . &quot;
