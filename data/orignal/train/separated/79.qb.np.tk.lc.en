okay , well , find out more .
it went to streckler automotive .
i &apos;m going to sue them .
they said it was a close bid . you were second .
i don &apos;t care if i was eighth .
they cheated . i had a black partner .
well , they had diversity , too .
and a female partner .
okay , this is what i want to do .
i want you to check out
streckler and doo @-@ dah-- whatever they &apos;re called--
because they paid somebody off .
you paid somebody off .
whose side are you on ?
i paid somebody off because they were .
all right ?
your honor ?
mr. gardner .
um , why are you here ?
to court @-@ martial you .
to see alicia florrick .
well , does she know you &apos;re here ?
i gave my name .
yes , but i don &apos;t ... i mean , maybe she didn &apos;t ...
come @-@ come with me .
are you maddie hayward , the ceo ?
yes , i am .
mandy post , synth magazine .
nice to meet you .
sorry-- once a reporter , always a reporter .
given your support for peter florrick ,
do you have any comment on this story
that he slept with a campaign worker ?
judge kuhn ...
i &apos;m surprised .
yes , mrs. florrick , this was a bit spontaneous .
i don &apos;t need you , mr. gardner .
um , he &apos;s a partner .
i &apos;m only a fourth year .
i know . but i don &apos;t need you .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
i was on a judicial panel
studying the mainstreaming of gender in the military ,
and there was a speaker
who had an issue our panel could not address .
i would like you to meet her .
you would like me ...
yes .
she &apos;s a member of the jag corps ,
and she was attacked last year while in afghanistan .
in what way attacked ?
by a man on the base .
he tried to rape her .
and you want me to ...
represent her .
i &apos;m sorry , i find myself a little lost here , your honor .
she needs a lawyer , but she &apos;s a military lawyer .
yes .
is she in trouble ?
no . she &apos;s suing .
who is she suing ? she can &apos;t sue the military .
the attacker was an employee of martinel security ,
one of the independent contractors in afghanistan .
given the evidence was deemed insufficient
for criminal prosecution ,
she decided to sue in civil court .
i see .
and can i ask you why me ?
i didn &apos;t think it went so well last time in court .
everyone deserves a second chance .
eli .
ah , mandy .
here to exercise your particular brand
of &quot; gotcha &quot; journalism ?
we &apos;re printing the story , eli .
you &apos;re printing a story you know is untrue ?
no , we are printing a story that has become a topic of conversation .
it &apos;s only become a topic of conversation because
some blogger who lives in his mom &apos;s apartment put it out there .
when did the mainstream media become such a bitch of the blogosphere ?
good quote . want that in the online edition ?
go to hell .
we &apos;re running the story on monday , eli .
and maddie hayward was here .
sh ... what ?
maddie hayward was here ?
no , she left .
she wasn &apos;t here for you , eli .
the figures for the discretionary fund ...
who are you ?
i am still a partner here .
you can &apos;t just give away my office .
i can , and i did .
well , this sucks .
diane , what is going on here ?
mr. gold , you are on a campaign .
the last time you used your office was two months ago .
we cannot afford a part @-@ time lawyer taking up office space .
no , you can &apos;t afford to piss me off .
my candidate wins , we bring millions of business here .
your candidate wins , you &apos;ll bring it here anyway .
you have $ 250,000 in capital contribution ,
five percent of the yearly draw .
you go somewhere else , you lose that .
this is just stupid here .
all of september .
one , two ...
captain hellinger ?
this is the civilian lawyer we discussed ,
alicia florrick .
oh , yes .
thank you , colonel , but i &apos;ve decided i &apos;m fine on my own .
i &apos;m pursuing this pro se .
i understand . good luck .
one second , mrs. florrick .
you need her .
you need someone who knows civil court .
i &apos;m fine .
i @-@ i have to argue this brief in two hours , i can &apos;t ...
and that &apos;s why you need her .
at least let her read the brief .
mrs. florrick , do you mind reading a motion to compel ?
actually , i don &apos;t want to intrude .
you &apos;re not intruding .
captain . ask her if she will read your brief .
it &apos;s just a motion to compel the production of a witness .
nothing too elaborate .
i can see that .
i &apos;m trying to keep it simple ...
well ?
it &apos;s well @-@ reasoned .
thank you . any pointers ?
you won &apos;t win the motion .
but you just said it was well @-@ reasoned .
cook county judges don &apos;t decide merely on reason .
they decide on fear of being overturned on appeal .
and they have nothing to fear here .
they can sense when something &apos;s been written by a novice .
sorry , but that &apos;s what you are .
i have 12 years in the jag corps .
yes , and the judges will sense that .
the writing is too perfect , too neat .
you need to pull back on all the adjectives .
are you serious ?
yes .
what do you suggest , mrs. florrick ?
well , this is a motion for martinel security
to present your attacker in court for questioning ?
yes . ricky waters .
and you don &apos;t know where mr. waters is being stationed in afghanistan ?
they won &apos;t respond to my discovery requests .
well , first , you don &apos;t ask them .
they &apos;ll lie either way .
you find out yourself .
and how do i do that ?
consultation &apos;s over .
am i hired ?
thanks for doing this .
it comes out on monday , so i need to be ready .
i need something on the magazine or the editors or the writer .
they &apos;re all democrats , so it can &apos;t be politics .
some bias in their background ,
a job they didn &apos;t get , a lawsuit .
don &apos;t worry if it &apos;s obscure .
just give me something i can build on .
kalinda .
are you here with me ?
are you being investigated by the feds ?
no . i don &apos;t know . am i ? why ?
everybody &apos;s investigated at some point or another .
wh @-@ why ? what are you hearing ?
well , i &apos;m not hearing anything .
okay , so what are we talking about ?
where &apos;d you get this ?
i can &apos;t say .
well , what is it ?
i don &apos;t know .
kalinda , what the hell ?
it &apos;s from a federal investigation .
the question is : is this a photo about you or me ?
address and telephone number .
wow . thanks .
you don &apos;t seem happy .
it &apos;s just ... i &apos;m just busy .
your husband lost his bid .
he won &apos;t be doing business in chicago .
hello , everyone .
i hope you &apos;re staying cool ...
today on this unusually hot november day .
and , uh , i hope you don &apos;t mind me saying ,
&quot; global warming : one , skeptics : zero . &quot;
anyway , um , i believe we have a motion to consider ?
yes , your honor .
my client is suing the military contractor martinel security
for the actions of an employee who tried to rape her .
and i see that she herself is military personnel .
welcome . i have great respect for all those in uniform
no matter how our government sees fit to employ them .
now , let &apos;s see . oh , you were moving for the return
of a witness from overseas .
actually , your honor , there &apos;s been new information .
the witness , ricky waters , was transported back to the states
on two @-@ week leave , and is a mere 12 miles from here , in northbrook .
unfortunately , martinel security intends
to deploy him to afghanistan in 48 hours .
so this subpoena needs to be expedited .
oh , is that true , mr ...
stabler ?
uh , bucky , your honor .
bucky , of course . uh , is this true ?
actually , your honor ,
whether it &apos;s true or not , we believe it &apos;s irrelevant .
martinel security is immune from all civil actions ,
including this subpoena .
they &apos;re going for feres .
and why is that ?
feres v. the united states , your honor .
a serviceman or woman ,
such as the plaintiff , cannot sue the military .
therefore , by extension , they cannot sue a contractor
which is deemed an arm of the military .
your honor , the military contractor must prove
their aims and independence
are subjected to the military , and unless martinel
can prove that the military ordered this rape ...
excuse me , that is offensive , your honor .
no , the offense here is you are trying to protect
one of your employees from facing his accuser in court .
captain hellinger has served her country for 12 years .
at the very least , she deserves to face her rapist .
accused rapist , counselor .
ah , yes . accused rapist . thank you .
mr. stabler-- uh , bucky--
unless you have any more arguments , i &apos;m ready to rule .
your honor . one of the consequences of modern warfare
is a blurring of the lines between soldiers and contract workers .
mr. waters is being deployed to a military base
that is directly in the line of fire ,
which is why he is granted
the same protections from liability as every other soldier .
in fact , your honor ,
it &apos;s exactly on the same point of law
that most rulings to the contrary have been overturned on appeal .
oh , come on ! you &apos;d be more subtle
if you sent the judge a death threat ...
your honor ...
mrs. florrick , please .
before i rule , i would like to hear evidence on
how closely aligned martinel is with the military .
your honor , we only have a 48 @-@ hour window here .
i understand that . we can do a lot in 48 hours .
if it &apos;s true that mr. waters is subject to the military hierarchy ,
i will conclude that he and martinel are immune to lawsuit .
you &apos;re good .
i &apos;ve had practice .
take a compliment .
thank you .
let &apos;s win this .
so i get the fluff piece
and mandy post gets the real story ?
the false story .
yeah . why am i here , eli ?
what do you know about mandy post ?
what do i want to know about mandy post ?
she had a cousin in illinois
going through a nasty divorce . four years ago .
the wife accused him
of molesting one of their children .
okay ...
mandy &apos;s cousin denied he was a molester , of course ,
but the victim , a sweet nine @-@ year @-@ old girl ...
testified against her father ,
and he was convicted .
eli , are we gossiping here , or are we working ?
he &apos;s in prison now .
mandy &apos;s cousin .
12 years .
guess who prosecuted him .
peter florrick .
not for attribution .
so you &apos;re saying that my competitor , mandy post ,
wrote a story about peter florrick &apos;s sex life
as payback for prosecuting her cousin ?
i &apos;m saying it &apos;s an interesting observation .
florrick was the prosecutor ?
in a sense .
he was the state &apos;s attorney at the time .
what ? same difference .
no . it &apos;s not .
well , that &apos;s where you come in .
you know , journalism .
you lost the florrick affair story to mandy post .
what &apos;s the consolation prize ?
showing mandy had a hidden motive ?
peter ?
mom , mom . just one minute , okay ?
i &apos;m fine . i &apos;m always just fine .
hey . yeah , it &apos;s me .
i just wanted to warn you ...
the story &apos;s coming out .
and you may be questioned about it .
is it bad ?
it &apos;s pretty bad .
they say you approved .
that we have an open marriage .
have you heard anything from maddie ?
no , but i don &apos;t expect to .
you must be hurting on the money front .
no , we &apos;re okay .
for now .
you know , these things always come around , so ...
i don &apos;t want to .
please calm down , mrs. florrick .
no , i &apos;m not gonna calm down !
um , just one more quick thing .
jackie is firing another caretaker .
have you got any other references i can ...
sorry , no .
hey , is it a woman ? the one she &apos;s firing ?
yeah . why ?
try a man .
really ?
just a hunch .
ask the hospital if they have any men .
okay , i will , thanks .
quit , quit !
now go now , just go .
go . go .
everything all right ?
i don &apos;t know .
but i have given up on caring .
ryan hood . i am founder and
chief executive officer of martinel security .
and you have been contracting to the u.s. military for how long ?
well , since the beginning .
we were there in iraq . we &apos;re there in afghanistan .
ooh , how nice for you .
mr. hood , let &apos;s discuss your role in these war zones .
you not only provide support for the military ,
you essentially fight alongside them .
essentially .
the american military is understaffed .
there aren &apos;t enough personnel to fill all the combat needs .
that &apos;s why martinel , blackwater
and now academi fill the gaps .
but in the field , your employees
answer to the military hierarchy ?
yes .
without the chain of command , there would be anarchy .
so these @-@ these lawsuits ,
these subpoenas ,
they have a tendency to complicate the pursuit of national interests .
definitely .
take , for example , this subpoena of the witness , ricky waters ...
the attempted rapist , ricky waters .
excuse me , your honor .
that is uncalled for .
yes , mrs. florrick , please refrain .
the witness , ricky waters ,
trains soldiers in counter @-@ insurgency techniques .
if he isn &apos;t in afghanistan , american lives will be endangered .
thank you , mr. hood . your witness .
good morning , mr. hood .
or , i &apos;m sorry , what rank would you like to be referred to ?
come on , counselor .
this man is a ceo of a privately @-@ held firm .
he admits that . not saying he &apos;s a general .
bucky , please sit down .
mrs. florrick , i think i get your general point .
please proceed .
mr. hood , uh ...
what is the penalty for insubordination in the military ?
i don &apos;t understand . what insubordination ?
well , let &apos;s take articles 77 through 134
of the uniform code of military justice .
what is the penalty for insubordination in a combat zone ?
do you mean &quot; missing the movement of a unit ? &quot;
yes .
well , court @-@ martial . and , most probably , detention .
uh @-@ huh .
and any soldier not following orders from a superior into battle
would be subject to court @-@ martial ?
yes , ma &apos;am .
and , as you said , your employees follow these rules .
so they would be subject to court @-@ martial ?
yes . in a combat zone , yes .
then please explain what happened with martinel personnel
on october 12 , 2011 .
&quot; explain ? &quot;
could you be more specific ?
yes .
weren &apos;t martinel employees ordered by the military high command
to offer security in the ghanzi province
on october 12 of last year ?
we weren &apos;t ordered ; we were asked .
i &apos;m reading from a &quot; general order , &quot; not a &quot; general ask . &quot;
well , i think &quot; order &quot; was being used generically .
we considered it an ask .
i see . and didn &apos;t martinel go on strike ?
i wouldn &apos;t call it &quot; on strike &quot; &quot;
counselor , i think your cocounsel wants you .
in a letter to the high command ,
you called it &quot; a strike . &quot;
yes , well , that was a personal joke between friends .
you went &quot; on strike &quot;
until the military ensured the protection of your employees .
yes .
and if a soldier had done that--
refused to go into a combat zone without greater security--
wouldn &apos;t he be court @-@ martialed ?
that &apos;s not a fair comparison .
but it &apos;s true , he would be court @-@ martialed ?
yes , but that &apos;s not a fair comparison .
and why not ?
because ... those were exceptional circumstances .
okay .
thank you , everyone .
mrs. florrick , i think you &apos;ve made your point .
for the current circumstances , i will grant the subpoena .
your honor ...
bucky , no .
please make mr. ricky waters available for questioning
by ... say , 3 : 00 this afternoon ,
or be subject to arrest .
we won .
oh , not yet .
you don &apos;t understand .
seeing him in court ? we won .
it &apos;s still crap .
mr. hayden , i understand that we might disagree ,
but i wish you wouldn &apos;t refer to everything as ...
cary .
how you doing ?
well . thank you .
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re in here .
and i &apos;m glad you survived the slaughter .
the firings ? yes .
i seem to have a few lives left , thank you .
i &apos;ve seen you talking to clarke .
he seems to like you .
that &apos;s good .
there aren &apos;t too many people here he likes .
well , i don &apos;t seek him out .
yeah , i know .
i wonder if you know what &apos;s happened to him .
he &apos;s become angrier and more abrasive with us .
he &apos;s starting to care .
on the bishop case , he enjoyed it .
he enjoyed participating .
he wants something like that .
something to build his life on .
he seems to think that lockhart / gardner might be it .
but it &apos;s not his firm .
oh , i know . i &apos;m not agreeing .
i &apos;m just suggesting why he might be more abrasive .
he cares .
could you talk to him ?
find out if that &apos;s what this is about ?
sure .
good .
and how are you doing ?
i have a question for you .
yes .
i &apos;m not sure if i &apos;ve done anything wrong with will .
with will ? why ?
i &apos;m just wondering if he doesn &apos;t trust me .
i know the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office .
i know how they work .
but i haven &apos;t been on a single criminal case .
i &apos;m just wondering if there &apos;s anything else i should know .
no .
no , i &apos;m ... i &apos;m surprised .
um , i &apos;m sorry i haven &apos;t kept track , cary .
no , definitely , you should be put on criminal cases .
i &apos;ll make sure that happens .
okay . thank you .
and i &apos;ll talk to mr. hayden .
okay .
uh ... good .
what was that about ?
oh , partner stuff .
i have something on our @-@ our tow truck magnate .
you have ? what ?
the winning bid .
there &apos;s a way to invalidate it .
streckler automotive ? how ?
one of their partners is an ex @-@ government employee .
they have to wait two years before they can bid .
and they did .
no , the bid got moved up by a month .
they missed it by a week .
they were a government employee ?
yes . by one week .
that means their bid can be invalidated .
and the bid would go to nick saverese .
if we want .
if we want nick saverese still to be a client ?
i &apos;ll take care of it .
mom , this is cristian .
mrs. florrick . hello .
you &apos;re a man .
yes , but i have a nursing license .
christian ? what &apos;s christian ?
mexican ?
cristian . cuban .
my family is from cuba .
excuse me .
yeah ?
yes , yes , yes . send it through .
i don &apos;t need help .
good . then i won &apos;t supply it .
i &apos;ll just collect my paycheck .
how much is my son paying you ?
$ 40 an hour .
$ 45 on the road .
i don &apos;t need it , peter .
you &apos;re getting it , mom .
you don &apos;t want me to campaign with you ?
no , i do . but i want you to be taken care of .
i don &apos;t like him .
you haven &apos;t given me a chance .
don &apos;t eavesdrop .
don &apos;t talk so loud when you gossip .
uh , give him a chance , mom .
give him a chance .
hello . yes , i &apos;m on .
yes , just send it through .
you okay ?
yes .
would you please state your name and occupation ?
ricky waters .
i &apos;m an employee of martinel security ,
working in counter @-@ insurgency training in afghanistan .
mr. waters , thank you for taking the time to speak to us today .
you &apos;re welcome . i &apos;m just a little surprised .
there must be some misunderstanding here .
the plaintiff claims that you attacked her on april 30 , 2011
at camp dwyer in the helman river valley of afghanistan .
yes , i read the charge .
laura , i &apos;m sorry , that didn &apos;t happen .
sir , two things . don &apos;t address my client .
and when you do refer to her ,
it &apos;s captain hellinger .
yes , ma &apos;am .
my apologies . captain .
so , you did know captain hellinger at camp dwyer .
yes , she was negotiating contracts for roads and hospitals .
sometimes we saw each other at the mwr , uh ...
the morale , welfare , recreational center .
yes , the mwr .
in fact , you had drinks at the mwr with captain hellinger
on the night in question , did you not ?
yes , there was a party for new reservists ,
including myself .
after which she claims
that you both went back to her office .
well , we both had offices
on the first floor of the 35th combat support hospital ,
so , yes , we did go back .
and there she claims that you threatened her with a demotion
if she refused to sleep with you .
no , there &apos;s ... no way that could have happened .
i have no sway over ...
you were friends with major hart .
captain hellinger--
you must be quiet .
what happened after that , mr. waters ?
to the best of your memory .
captain hellinger was drinking .
she was tipsy .
i asked her if she wanted me to take her to her barracks .
she said no .
she kept hanging on me .
all i can imagine is that she took offense
at the way i was rebuffing her .
i don &apos;t know what .
so it is your sworn testimony
that you never attacked captain hellinger .
correct .
in fact , i couldn &apos;t have attacked her .
i was sending an e @-@ mail at 0010 that night .
look at the time codes .
the exact same time as this supposed attack .
i &apos;ll have our investigator look into it .
he may not have sent the e @-@ mail .
he sent the e @-@ mail .
damn it .
this is a readout of all the e @-@ mails sent
from the 35th combat support hospital on april the 29th and 30th .
they got that to you fast .
yup .
evidence that works against us they always deliver fast .
he sent the e @-@ mail at the time of the attack .
that doesn &apos;t change the fact .
he could &apos;ve attacked her and sent the e @-@ mail .
there &apos;s something else .
something good ?
something very good .
one minute later-- here-- another e @-@ mail was sent
from a terminal in the next office .
there was a witness ?
yup .
someone was in the next office at the time of the attack .
let &apos;s subpoena him , and i &apos;ll get on with ...
i &apos;ll just be right back .
hi .
hi , maddie . what &apos;s up ?
i tried to see you earlier , but , uh ...
you were busy .
we &apos;re fine , maddie .
we really are .
you &apos;re not giving money to my husband . it &apos;s okay .
no . um , it &apos;s just ...
i thought it only fair to warn you before i announce .
announce what ?
my candidacy .
i &apos;m running against your husband .
alicia , i know this will probably affect our friendship ,
but i really believe this campaign needs a woman .
i thought your husband could represent our interests ,
but after this past week , this last story ...
i know you say it &apos;s a lie , but women have always ...
maddie , you don &apos;t need to explain anything .
i know .
but i want you to understand .
i understand , and you don &apos;t have to explain anything .
okay .
maybe we could still talk .
sure . whenever you want .
i &apos;m sorry , alicia , it &apos;s ... the issues are too important to delay .
and you have the money to run .
it &apos;s not personal .
yep , just business .
alicia , how are you ? what a pleasant ...
maddie hayward is running against peter .
she ... what ?
maddie hayward just came to my office to tell me
that she is running against peter .
yes . she doesn &apos;t feel he represents female issues .
she &apos;s timing it to the affair story .
yes .
and she &apos;s going to pull all his female support .
i know .
and she has money .
and one last thing .
she befriended me and we talked .
you ...
yes .
i shared some things she could possibly use .
you don &apos;t ...
about you and will ?
no , about how i feel about peter .
about being in the public eye .
about issues i think he &apos;s weak on .
okay , we need to debrief you .
and mike kresteva needs to keep his hands
off seniors &apos; medical benefits .
is that the right line ?
where are your glasses ?
maybe if you find your glasses , you could read the line .
maybe if you kept track of my glasses .
you can &apos;t read the lines ...
don &apos;t even ask .
i need to go to court .
you need to deal with this .
no , after court .
yes , oh ...
it &apos;s in your lap now .
you can &apos;t do that robocop .
this is how you &apos;re going to do it : you lost your glasses ...
the difficulty we &apos;re running into , your honor ,
is that this witness-- the one who e @-@ mailed at the same time
and who we think heard and possibly observed the attack--
is sergeant wade compton ,
who is still serving in afghanistan .
we can &apos;t subpoena him , colonel ,
and the command is rebuffing our efforts to transfer him home to testify .
yes , i know .
so you know we need him ?
we think this sergeant heard everything .
i understand that . i &apos;m not sure what you think i can do .
contact his superiors . request that he testify in court .
captain , you know i can &apos;t do that .
you know that exceeds my authority .
we thought that maybe you could make an extra effort ,
given your previous sympathy for captain hellinger &apos;s situation .
mrs. florrick , you are asking something of me
that goes beyond my ability .
thank you , colonel .
is there something else , mrs. florrick ?
you know what &apos;s going on here .
the army doesn &apos;t want her to win .
they are siding with martinel
because they don &apos;t want their contractor undercut .
yes , that &apos;s my understanding .
she &apos;s being pressured to quit . did you know that ?
i didn &apos;t know that .
but i understand it .
so , why won &apos;t you help ?
mrs. florrick , stop playing on my emotions .
i know what you &apos;re saying .
and if it were in my ability to help , i would .
he &apos;s reading the steve jobs biography .
excuse me ?
you were wondering why mr. hayden was acting so abrasive ?
he &apos;s reading the steve jobs bio .
that &apos;s why he says everything &quot; sucks &quot; or is &quot; crap . &quot;
the same thing happened at the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office .
some managers , they think it worked for jobs ,
it &apos;ll work for them .
what would you do ?
it wears off .
but do you want me to talk to him ?
that &apos;d be good .
oh , and i have two criminal cases i want you to look at .
they might plead out , but i &apos;m not sure .
a glass of white ?
thanks for doing this .
having a drink ? why not ?
there &apos;s a chance the winning bid could be invalidated .
my husband &apos;s bid ?
streckler automotive made a mistake .
one of their partners used to be connected to the city .
that makes sense .
so ... he &apos;ll win the bid ?
only if he knows about it .
how could he not know about it ?
he asked us to check into streckler automotive &apos;s payoffs .
he did not ask us to check into their partners .
do you love him ?
no .
then ?
i ...
i have difficulty being away from him .
is he dangerous ?
sometimes .
shouldn &apos;t you stay away , then ?
yeah .
that &apos;s odd .
judge kuhn .
and the panel investigating the mainstreaming of gender
in the military is back in session .
we have one more witness for the panel .
are you ready to be questioned , sergeant ?
yes , ma &apos;am .
please supply your name for the record .
sergeant wade compton .
thank you , sergeant ,
for returning from afghanistan for this session .
this panel has only one question for you , sergeant .
yes ?
what do you think of the mainstreaming of gender in the military ?
what do i think ?
yes .
i don &apos;t ... know .
uh , it &apos;s ... good ?
thank you , sergeant . you &apos;re excused .
that &apos;s it ?
yes . thank you for returning at our request .
sergeant compton ?
do you have a moment ?
i seem to have a lot of moments .
what do you need ?
sergeant wade compton .
camp dwyer , afghanistan .
i serve as liaison with private contractors during training .
and where is your office located ?
in the 35th combat support hospital .
near captain hellinger &apos;s and mr. waters &apos; offices ?
yes , ma &apos;am . captain .
and given your proximity to them ,
did you have occasion to hear anything unusual ...
objection . hearsay , your honor .
it &apos;s an admission against interest .
sergeant compton &apos;s job depends on positive reports
from mr. waters , his superior .
anything negative that he says is therefore an exception to hearsay .
uh ... overruled .
you may answer .
i heard voices--
captain hellinger and mr. waters arguing .
about what ?
well , mr. waters wanted to have sex with captain hellinger .
and she resisted his advances ?
yes , ma &apos;am .
physically ?
yes .
i heard them struggle .
i think he ripped her clothes
and she kicked him , and then he called her a &quot; bitch . &quot;
a &quot; nasty bitch , &quot; i think is what he said .
and then ... she ran out of there .
and why didn &apos;t you come forward until now , sergeant ?
well , like you said ,
mr. waters is kind of like ... my boss .
i mean , he &apos;s close with my c.o. , so ...
so you feared for your job .
i ...
yes , ma &apos;am .
thank you .
nothing further , your honor .
anything , counselor ?
counselor ?
uh , yes , your honor .
sergeant compton ,
you seem pretty clear as to the events of that night .
do you remember it well ?
yes , sir .
then do you remember what time it was
that you heard this attack on captain hellinger ?
i always wait until close to midnight
to e @-@ mail my girlfriend , because with the time difference .
so , i remember i was waiting
for an e @-@ mail back when i heard the fight .
it was about 0015 .
0015 . so , for the benefit of us civilians ,
that &apos;s after midnight ?
yes , 15 minutes after .
what &apos;s he after ?
defense exhibit d , your honor .
mr. waters &apos; reserve deployment orders .
and as you can see ,
mr. waters was officially called up to active duty
as of that very same midnight .
objection , your honor !
what could you possibly object to , mrs. florrick ?
you proved your point .
mr. waters attacked your client .
i did not !
but at the time of the attack ,
he was no longer working for martinel security .
by 15 minutes , your honor .
it doesn &apos;t matter if it was 15 seconds .
he was in the army on active duty
and therefore protected by feres v. the united states .
and captain hellinger is barred by law from suing him .
your honor .
mrs. florrick ,
you will have every opportunity to verify the timeline ,
but i &apos;m afraid mr. stabler is right .
unless you can prove that the attack occurred before midnight ,
i will have no choice but to dismiss the case .
i wasn &apos;t watching the clock .
i was trying to get out of there without getting raped .
of course you were . that &apos;s not the issue .
the issue is the length of the assault .
meaning what ?
you said he started harassing you in the bar at the mwr ?
yes .
and then he followed you back to the office ?
so it could be viewed as one long attack ?
i ... i can &apos;t lie .
it &apos;s not about lying .
it &apos;s about more fully remembering a past event .
i know , it sounds like a rationalization .
it &apos;s not . you were hit on in the bar .
you pushed him off . maybe even laughed .
not because it was funny ,
but because it &apos;s the easiest way to make him go away .
then i went back to my office .
and i wasn &apos;t afraid until he followed me there .
do you think that he had the same intent
at the bar as he did in the office ?
to have sex , or force you to have sex ?
yes , but legally , it doesn &apos;t matter .
the only thing that matters is
whether i experienced it as one attack .
laura , you need to stop thinking as a lawyer .
we &apos;re your lawyers . experience it as a woman .
so when mr. waters first propositioned you ,
it was at the bar at the mwr ?
yes .
what did you do ?
i said no .
and he persisted ?
yes .
it was like he wouldn &apos;t take no for an answer .
he &apos;d been drinking , he was getting angry .
did you fear for your safety ?
yes . that &apos;s why i left the mwr ,
because his behavior was scaring me .
but then he followed me to my office .
one last question , captain hellinger .
what time did this conduct take place at the bar ?
it was about 23 : 30 .
thank you .
so you &apos;re saying this was one prolonged assault , is that it ?
and since it began before midnight ,
martinel security is , in fact , still liable ?
yes .
so we are to assume that
you were in fear for your safety during this whole time ?
yes .
that &apos;s very convenient , isn &apos;t it ?
argumentative , your honor .
sorry . i &apos;ll withdraw that and offer this instead .
you sent a text message that same night
to a lieutenant parisi of the jag corps .
she a friend of yours ?
yes , that &apos;s right .
would you read it for us , please , out loud ?
&quot; leaving mwr now . ck was blitzed . lmao . &quot;
would you clarify for the court what &quot; lmao &quot; means ?
uh , that &apos;s quite all right . i think i &apos;m aware . lol .
very well , your honor .
please , captain , continue .
&quot; so happy i &apos;m off tomorrow .
off to catch some zs . night , girl . &quot;
and what &apos;s the time stamp on that text message ?
11 : 52 p.m.
11 : 52 p.m. so you must have sent that message
while you were walking back from the mwr
to your office at that time , did you not ?
yes .
it doesn &apos;t sound like you were in fear for your safety , though ,
as you were walking back to your office , does it ?
damn you !
get in line .
i got fired , eli !
what ?
my editor thought it was unprofessional
that i was pursuing a personal agenda .
now i &apos;m the story .
you sicced peggy byrne on me like an attack dog ,
and now i am out .
well , look at it this way .
the good thing about a 24 @-@ minute news cycle
is that they &apos;ll all be on to something else soon .
if it &apos;s any consolation ,
i do feel a tiny bit bad about it .
they say dancing the mambo is like talking to angels .
oh , you kidder !
what ? it &apos;s true .
i &apos;ll teach you the mambo . it &apos;s so easy .
come on . we &apos;ll be late . let &apos;s get the car .
you were right .
i just had to give him a chance .
i see that .
sometimes a mother has to listen to her son .
thank you .
good evening , mr. gold .
indeed it is , mrs. florrick .
what ?
she &apos;s happy .
yeah , she is .
please sit .
i ...
i &apos;ve given this a great deal of thought .
and i want you to know , captain hellinger ,
that i am truly sympathetic to your plight .
to be denied justice in military court was tragic .
to be denied justice again in civilian court is just cruel .
but i &apos;m afraid the supreme court has spoken very clearly
in feres , as much as i may personally disagree .
mr. waters was an army reservist at the time of the attack ,
and therefore is immune from liability .
as such , i &apos;m afraid i must dismiss the case .
thank you .
thank you , bucky .
no hard feelings .
step back !
yes , colonel .
captain .
colonel .
we &apos;ll appeal .
no .
no appeals . i &apos;m done .
i &apos;m so sorry .
we got him into court .
that &apos;s more than i thought we &apos;d do .
what do you do when ... when it &apos;s all over ?
you start up again .
well , thank you very much .
that &apos;s really great news . okay .
done !
any more money calls , eli ?
there are always more money calls .
maddie hayward ...
the competition .
well , i couldn &apos;t just let you run away with this .
your innermost feminist demanded satisfaction .
something like that , yes .
well , first of all , maddie ,
i &apos;m gonna beat you .
and then i &apos;m gonna beat the republican , kresteva .
no , peter . you need money .
i have money . i &apos;m willing to spend my own .
people are drawn to people willing to spend their own .
maybe you beat me , but you &apos;ll be tapped out ,
and kresteva will outspend you .
but there is another way .
i can hardly wait .
you drop out and run as my lieutenant governor .
it &apos;s a good position . you &apos;d be good at it .
you used my wife .
you befriended her and used her .
i didn &apos;t use her . i befriended her .
i didn &apos;t know i was going to do this .
you know , i can trust a cynic and a con man ,
but i can &apos;t trust a hypocrite
because the hypocrite doesn &apos;t know when she &apos;s lying ,
and that &apos;s the most dangerous liar of them all .
so that &apos;s a no ?
that &apos;s more than a no .
that &apos;s a never .
okay . see you out there .
well ?
