guys , tickets already went on sale !
what ? !
they &apos;re not supposed to be available yet .
i don &apos;t know what to tell you , but they &apos;re on sale !
what ? wait . you &apos;re sure they &apos;re star wars tickets ?
no , it &apos;s steel magnolias 2 : even steelier .
the web site &apos;s frozen . i can &apos;t get in !
same here !
guys , they &apos;re gonna sell out !
what are we gonna do ? !
all right , this goes against everything i stand for ,
but desperate times call for desperate measures .
lord ...
this is sheldon cooper .
you &apos;re good friends with my mom .
i know i &apos;ve spent my life denying that you exist .
got &apos; em !
and i will continue to do so !
i &apos;m really happy you and amy are back together .
oh , thank you .
i &apos;m also really happy , but i can &apos;t pretend it &apos;s for you .
new star wars in three days !
hey , thursday can &apos;t get here soon enough .
i &apos;m taking off work to watch the original trilogy
while i eat enough star wars cereal to choke a wookiee .
uh , sweetie , you do realize thursday is amy &apos;s birthday .
and you do realize i bought my ticket
when amy and i were broken up ?
i hope you didn &apos;t need anything in that case ,
&apos;cause it &apos;s closed .
you guys just got back together .
you might not want to ditch her on her birthday .
i think penny has a point . you can see it another day .
but someone might spoil the movie .
no one can spoil amy &apos;s birthday for me .
surprise ! she &apos;s even older .
who saw that coming ?
oh , that &apos;s nice .
put that on her cake .
oh , great . this again .
arthur , what brings you back ?
uh , beats me . i @-@ i just ...
hope this isn &apos;t a @-@ a sex dream .
in the past , you &apos;ve come to me
when i &apos;m struggling with a dilemma .
and @-@ and the one time where ... where you were afraid ,
and you needed me for ... for a night light .
what &apos;s @-@ what &apos;s troubling you ?
my friends are telling me
i shouldn &apos;t abandon my girlfriend on her birthday
to see the new star wars movie .
well , sounds right .
can ... can i get out of this ...
muumuu now ?
those are the robes of the jedi ,
the guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy .
and they ... they @-@ they don &apos;t wear underwear .
so , you agree with my friends
that i should skip the premiere ?
uh , do ... do you love this girl ?
yes .
but she knows how important star wars is to me .
well , maybe you should show her how ...
how important she is to you .
by seeing the movie she &apos;d want me to see ?
sheldon , you @-@ you can see this movie whenever you want .
but you only have a limited number of days
that you @-@ you can be with this woman .
be with her .
you &apos;re right .
great .
where are you going ?
i don &apos;t know ,
but hopefully , somewhere i can wear pants .
sheldon , what &apos;s wrong ?
i wanted to let you know i &apos;ll be spending your birthday with you .
okay .
see , i @-@ i had tickets to the star wars premiere that night ,
but professor proton came to me in a dream dressed as
obi @-@ wan kenobi and convinced me i should be with you .
obi @-@ what ?
i &apos;ll @-@ i &apos;ll let you get back to sleep now . good night .
okay . good night .
wait . um , sheldon ,
were you actually not gonna spend my birthday with me ?
it &apos;s late . got to go . bye .
good for sheldon deciding to stay with amy on her birthday .
i know .
it &apos;s still gonna be weird to see the movie without him .
well , we could wait a couple days and see it together .
hello .
we &apos;re going to the comic book store . you want to come ?
no , i can &apos;t .
i need to make preparations for amy &apos;s birthday .
which leads me to the following bit of business .
this is my ticket to star wars .
i don &apos;t have to tell you it is worth far more
than its face value of $ 15.50 .
i trust you &apos;ll give it to someone worthy .
you got it .
well , penny might want to join us .
this is my ticket to star wars .
penny .
penny ?
penny ?
what happens if i say , &quot; come in &quot; ?
well , find out .
come in !
bernadette ?
bernadette ? bernadette ?
come in !
keep it up .
i got nowhere else to be .
just come in .
for future reference , if i want to watch mean girls ,
i &apos;ll stream it on netflix .
we &apos;re sorry . what do you need ?
well , as you know ,
i &apos;ll be celebrating amy &apos;s birthday with her ,
and i could use your assistance
in helping me select the perfect gift .
sure .
well , so far , i &apos;ve come up with three ideas .
the first is a chance for her to play the harp
with the l.a. philharmonic .
wow . you can really arrange that ?
well , i said a chance , you know .
when you tell them it &apos;s your birthday at bennigan &apos;s ,
they make a fuss .
i don &apos;t see why the philharmonic would be any different .
how about something a little more realistic ?
well , amy enjoys knitting her own sweaters ,
so i was thinking of getting her an all @-@ expense @-@ paid trip
to the wisconsin sheep and wool festival .
sorry . i was waiting for the bazinga .
hold on . it could be romantic .
the two of them away together ,
keeping each other warm in snowy wisconsin .
no , no , no , no . she &apos;d be going alone .
well , if you think i &apos;m afraid of birds ,
you should see me around sheep .
okay , well , what &apos;s the third option ?
that i have coitus with her .
what do you think about giving sheldon &apos;s ticket to stuart ?
i don &apos;t know .
have you ever seen a movie with stuart before ?
it &apos;s like going with your grandpa .
instead of eating popcorn ,
he brings little pieces of chicken in tupperware
and a thermos full of soup .
he &apos;s not that bad .
hey , stuart , got any plans thursday night ?
my , uh ... my doctor &apos;s worried about my circulation ,
so i was thinking about walking around the mall .
why ?
hey , you guys .
oh , make sure to wear sensible shoes .
wil , want to go to star wars thursday ?
absolutely .
fine , take wil .
see if he brings you clam chowder .
okay , okay , okay , okay , okay .
let &apos;s @-@ let &apos;s ... let &apos;s just recap our options .
all right , we &apos;ve got harp thing , sheep thing ...
wild thang .
which do you think she &apos;d prefer ?
because i checked the sheep and wool festival web site ,
and there &apos;s only 8,000 tickets left .
sheldon , being physical with amy is a huge step for you .
yeah , are you ready for this ?
intimacy in any form has been challenging for me ,
but i &apos;d like to show her how important she is ,
and it feels like now might be the right time .
sheldon , that &apos;s so beautiful .
then it &apos;s settled .
amy &apos;s birthday present will be my genitals .
thanks for taking me out .
well , you &apos;re spending your birthday with sheldon .
why not celebrate early ?
so where do you want to go ?
i heard that new mexican place on green street is good .
sure , sure .
or we could take you to get a bikini wax .
why would i get a bikini wax for my birthday ?
uh , i don &apos;t know . it was just a thought .
i think i &apos;ll just stick to mexican .
great . and then maybe after , we can watch a dirty movie ,
and if anybody has any questions about what happened or how ,
we can answer them .
okay , what is going on ?
oh , we just want you to be prepared
for any surprises that might happen tomorrow .
what surprises ?
we don &apos;t want to spoil anything ,
but you should know that
sheldon said he &apos;s ready to be physical .
you shut your damn mouth !
you actually heard him say this ?
yes . he said he wants to do something
to show you how much you mean to him .
i @-@ i can &apos;t believe it . i ...
i don &apos;t know what to say .
well , we &apos;re really happy for you ,
and we know how much he cares ...
i do know what to say ! let &apos;s get me waxed !
why isn &apos;t it ever angie dickinson &apos;s bedroom ?
you &apos;re back .
it @-@ it doesn &apos;t seem like it &apos;s up to me .
i suppose you &apos;re here because ...
i &apos;ve decided to be physical with my girlfriend ,
and i &apos;ve never done that before .
e @-@ excuse me for a moment .
well , it was worth a shot .
so , can you help me ?
uh , all right . um ...
once @-@ once the man gets
the @-@ the woman out of her ... out of her bloomers ...
oh , no . not that .
i @-@ i understand the mechanics .
oh , good , good . &apos; cause , uh ,
i have no idea what kids these days are ...
calling their @-@ their parts .
i think they say &quot; junk . &quot;
what is happening to this world ?
what @-@ what do you actually need to know ?
this is an important night for us ,
and i &apos;m worried i might be overwhelmed
and ruin everything .
sheldon , if @-@ if you &apos;re with the right person ,
it @-@ it &apos;ll be okay .
thank you , arthur .
you are the wisest of the wise .
well , that &apos;s @-@ that &apos;s very nice of you to say ,
but i think i &apos;m just an expression of ...
of your unconscious mind .
oh , sure . yeah .
well , you &apos;re fun to look at .
tonight &apos;s the night !
yeah , the wait is finally over !
i know . then you &apos;ll finally stop talking about it !
ready to go ?
let &apos;s do this .
have fun , guys !
we will .
i can &apos;t believe sheldon gave this up .
i know . we &apos;re gonna have so much more fun than him .
no , they &apos;re not .
knowing them , they will .
t minus 15 minutes !
oh , did you hear from wil ?
yeah , he &apos;s on his way .
time for bladder check .
check .
check .
check . wait .
screw it . i &apos;m holding it .
what is everyone booing at ?
hey , guys . what &apos;s up ?
um , hey , wil . what you doin &apos; ?
i was on star trek . i &apos;m just rooting for the home team .
star trek stinks !
yeah ? live long and suck it !
birthday girl .
birthday girl . birthday girl .
come in !
hi , sheldon .
hello . sorry i &apos;m late .
i also got you a balloon ,
but it floated away , and i chased it for a while .
that &apos;s okay . come on in .
thank you . mm @-@ hmm .
um , i &apos;ll ... i &apos;m gonna go put these in water .
ooh , this is different , hmm ?
candles and music .
do you like it ?
it &apos;s kind of spooky .
i can change it back .
no , no , no . it &apos;s your birthday .
as long as no one jumps out in a hockey mask , i &apos;ll be fine .
so ...
what &apos;d you have in mind for tonight ?
i thought i could take you out to a nice birthday dinner .
if we pick a place east of here , we might find the balloon .
um , that sounds nice , but ...
i &apos;m not really hungry right now .
i thought maybe ...
we could do presents first .
all right .
i should probably tell you something about this gift .
you mean before you ...
give it to me ?
yes .
may i ask you a question before i ...
give it to you ?
of course .
why are we saying
&quot; give it to you &quot; like that ?
sheldon ,
i know your present is ...
for us to be intimate tonight .
i see .
is that all right ?
i &apos;m sorry , but this is a litigious society .
i &apos;m gonna need verbal consent .
yes .
you know what , let me pull a quick contract off the internet .
so , if you don &apos;t like star wars , why are you here ?
oh , i &apos;m just having fun .
everyone takes star wars so seriously .
like if the movie &apos;s bad , it &apos;s gonna ruin their lives .
is it bad ? did you hear something ?
oh , my god . it &apos;s bad . somebody kill me .
see ? that &apos;s what i mean .
when you wake up in the morning , whether this is
the greatest movie ever or a total piece of crap ,
your life isn &apos;t gonna change at all .
he &apos;s right .
yeah .
no matter what happens ,
we &apos;re coming back tomorrow to watch it again .
do you think sheldon &apos;s actually gonna go through with it ?
i don &apos;t know .
he said he &apos;s ready .
yeah , but he also swore this was the year
he &apos;d be able to pull the guts out of a pumpkin .
well , i &apos;m gonna stay positive . i mean , we talked .
i told him what women like , and after he stopped giggling ,
he seemed pretty sure of himself .
hi .
hello .
so , um ...
should i get under the covers with you ?
all right .
hello .
hi !
why are you shaking ? are you cold ?
i &apos;m just , um ... really nervous .
why ?
i &apos;ve been waiting for this for so long ,
i &apos;ve just ... built it up in my head .
i don &apos;t know what to expect .
neither do i.
but ... we can find out together .
okay .
i &apos;m really nervous .
i know .
we &apos;ve been waiting so long for this .
and we &apos;ve built it up in our heads so much .
guys , it &apos;s just a movie .
that &apos;s true .
he &apos;s right .
it is .
although , we all remember jar jar .
leonard , i @-@ i &apos;m scared again .
在不远处的一间闺房里 ...
well , i enjoyed that more than i thought i would .
me , too .
i look forward to your next birthday
when we do it again .
that works for me .
i enjoyed that more than i thought i would .
i don &apos;t think i can walk right now .
uh , sheldon ?
sheldon .
arthur .
what are you doing here ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t think i need any more advice .
i @-@ i was just curious .
how @-@ how &apos;d it go ?
it was amazing .
i @-@ i saw it a few days later .
what a movie .
but , uh , what @-@ what about amy ?
uh , uh , she liked it fine .
but she doesn &apos;t have the history with the franchise i do .
okay .
good ... good talk .
