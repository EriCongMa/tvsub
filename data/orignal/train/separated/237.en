Gossip girl here--
your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
This is my granddaughter, Charlie Rhodes.
No one can touch me anymore.
I'm a Rhodes now.
Charlotte Rhodes?
My husband and I were looking for my niece
with the same name, remember?
Did you ever find her?
She was with her mother.
If they ever found out the truth
about the real Charlotte Rhodes,
they would never forgive me.
I'm leaving tonight.
This time, I'm not coming back.
You must be pretty desperate to flirt with me
by doing manual labor.
This isn't flirting.
I've always wanted to load a catering van.
I love you, Dan Humphrey.
Always have. Always will.
You saw the chance to be her only savior,
her knight in shining armor.
Are you really mad about Blair,
or is this about us.
Because I haven't given you an answer yet?
You just did.
Of course I love you, Chuck.
I've always loved you.
I know who sent the video
of Blair and Chuck to "Gossip girl" in the first place.
It's a dirty job, but someone's gotta do it.
There is nothing between us but a contract.
Our marriage is all for show.
You and your family will quite literally pay the consequence,
Or did you forget about the dowry?
Your family cannot control mine.
Yes, they can.
I don't believe in saving myself
and ruining our family at the same time.
Another picture-perfect Valentine's Day on the upper east side,
and how am I going to celebrate?
By exposing a giant secret today
that's sure to break more than a few hearts.
You can just drop those right there. Thank you.
Miss Blair! You're back!
Oh! I-I was worried you'd be locked away in big, stone tower somewhere
and only way to speak
is through smoke signals or coded messages on Twitter.
Thankfully, Dorota, we don't need to learn Navajo just yet.
The truth is, after our horrid faux honeymoon,
I think Louis was glad to get back to Monaco
and be rid of me for a little while.
So this mean you no longer trapped in his evil grasp.
Not exactly.
Dorota, this is Estee,
A.K.A. my new social secretary.
A.K.A. my royal minder.
But I've just been calling her "creeper" for short.
Estee will be accompanying me now
on all official public outings.
Did I mention she also reads my mail
and performs nightly bed checks?
Blair's first public appearance will be this evening,
just as soon as she picks one of these charity galas
to make her official debut as princess.
How great is that?
Oh, wow, that's beautiful.
Good morning. Wh-what's all this?
It's called Valentine's day, Dan.
I'm picking out some Cartier jewelry
to give to Lily tonight.
So where is she? Aren't you afraid she's gonna see it?
Mm, she's in D.C. at a fund-raiser luncheon.
Won't be back till this afternoon.
And tonight, Chuck has hooked us up
with a huge suite at the empire.
Pretty romantic, right?
Yeah, that sounds nice.
Can I interest you in anything?
Something for your, uh, special lady?
Me? No, no, no. I have no special lady this year.
Honestly, I was just coming by to pick up
those blu-rays I let Lily borrow. Uh...
Thought maybe I could give them to Blair.
You know, she's back from her honeymoon alone, so...
So you figure that if you, uh, drop them off,
maybe she'll ask you to watch one with her.
Well, cinema's always been intended as a communal art.
It's better to watch with another person.
She's a married woman now, Dan. It might be time to move on.
I appreciate the advice, dad,
but I'm just trying to be a good friend.
Really, it doesn't mean anything.
Okay.
I can't stand seeing all these happy people,
smiling, holding hands, kissing.
Don't remind me.
Guess it's only natural when you and I feel
this anti-Valentine's Day.
It hasn't exactly been a banner year
for either of us in the romance department.
At least the person you love told you they felt the same.
Mine didn't even respond.
Well, the good news is, this outsized outpouring
display of public affection will be over tomorrow.
Then New Yorkers can go back
to being their usual cold, callous selves.
Hang in there.
Yeah, you, too.
Oh, I love them!
Sorry. Have a good day.
I doubt that.
Oh, hey, I guess the honeymoon's over.
Just the person I wanted to see.
I can't talk now. I'm busy.
Wait, wait, wait, stop.
I will not allow us to go on living like this together.
The way I see it, I am mad at you for sending out that video
of me and Chuck to "Gossip girl,"
and you are mad at me for running off with Dan.
So... they cancel each other out.
Actually, yours was way worse.
I-I only needed a ride,
but the point is--
Blair, I didn't release the video to "Gossip girl."
You took the fall for us?
It seemed like the right thing to do at the time.
Well, since you're clearly looking out
for my best interests, I forgive you.
Now can you forgive me for
using your wedding date as a getaway driver?
Well, I was never really mad at you.
Okay, well, tell me what incredible romantic plans
you have for today.
Oh, you know, just interviewing.
A 70-year-old avowed celibate woman
for my "All the reasons I hate valentine's day" column,
and trying to figure out ways not to become her.
That sounds like an absolutely awful valentine's day.
They've all been pretty awful for the past few years.
The last good one I had was
in high school with--
Oh! You were about to say "With him."
I have to go.
I heard you were back,
and I suspected you might not have any big plans tonight,
so I thought I would, uh, drop off some movies.
I could come back and watch them with you.
I mean, under the radar, of course.
That is sweet, but I actually already have plans
to go back on the radar,
which you should, too.
You should go out with someone. Have fun.
If only it were that easy.
I don't think I've had a real date on valentine's day
since, uh, since high school with... well, Serena.
I've gotta go meet Alessandra at Fig & Olive
to discuss my next opus, so have a nice night.
You, too, Dan.
Dorota!
I am suddenly feeling inspired,
which is why I want to upgrade my royal status
from princess to queen...of hearts.
And what that mean exactly?
It means that I will do everything in my power
to get Dan and Serena back together.
Hello?
Lola, hey, it's Nate.
Who?
Archibald.
From the wedding.
Oh, that Nate.
The one I don't remember giving my number to.
Yeah, well, I might have put a little pressure on your boss.
Blackmailing bosses may have been the reason
I didn't give you my number in the first place.
Hey, I only offered him some free advertising
in "The spectator," All right?
Technically, that's more of a bribe.
All right, either way,
what are you doing tonight?
And whatever excuse you're about to give,
I'm gonna poke holes in it, okay?
Do you have any idea
how cheesy it is to ask a girl out
for a first date on valentine's day?
Well, I prefer bold and charming to cheesy,
but that's just--
Also, did you forget that I'm a cater waiter?
Because valentine's is one of our busiest nights of the year,
so thanks for asking.
Lola?
Okay, Tina, my other informants have come up with nothing
but a new princess under 24-hour surveillance,
a lonely boy with no plans,
and a dog lover who hates the entire holiday.
Please tell me you have something better.
I'm afraid not.
Nate can't even get a cater waiter to go out with him.
What the hell am I paying you people for?
What am I gonna do?
Under my stewardship, "Gossip girl"
is but a shell of her former self,
like AOL or Courtney Love.
The only way to remedy this is with a scandal
to end all scandals.
You have a scandal.
Dan Humphrey is the one who sent you that video
of Chuck and Blair at Blair's wedding.
And with that to hold over his head,
you could get Dan to do almost everything.
Philip, it's cute when you pay attention.
But if I'm going to load up Dan like a hirsute hand grenade,
I need everyone to be there when he detonates.
Ugh! It was so much easier to stir stuff up
when we were all in high school
and at the same place all the time.
No.
It's too bad you can't all jump into a time machine
and go back to high school then, huh?
Ohh. Sweetie.
I knew I married you for a reason...
Besides your money.
Why didn't you tell me about the party?
Which party?
The "Come as You Were" party you're throwing here tonight.
It's all over "Gossip girl."
Dress as your high school self. That's awesome.
I wish you would have given me a little more notice, though.
I have to deck the place out.
I have to get the gift bags ready.
I have to--
Tina, I'm not throwing a party. All right?
This is someone's idea of a joke.
It is?
Yeah.
Too bad, 'cause that would have been great publicity
for "The spectator."
Although it probably would have been impossible
to find a caterer this last minute.
Wait. Wait, wait, wait. You know what? Why not?
It is a good idea.
All right, well, see what you can pull together,
and, uh, I'll handle the caterer.
Guess what, boys and girls?
Looks like school's back in session.
The question is, have you learned your lessons?
Let's hope not,
'cause I'm in the mood to see someone fail.
Charlie?
Rufus, hi.
Are you okay? What are you doing here?
We were so worried about you.
Oh, no, I'm fine. I'm totally fine.
I... I probably should have called weeks ago,
But, uh, is Lily here?
She's, uh, on her way back from D.C..
But I'm sure she'd love to see you.
Yeah, I'd love to see her, too.
I'm only in town for a few hours
on my way to Europe.
I just wanted to explain
to her in person why I left so abruptly.
Yeah. So... why did you leave so--
Oh, no, it's personal. No offense.
It's just, I'd rather tell her on my own.
Well, you're welcome to stay and wait till she gets back.
Thanks. And you know, I've been keeping up
on what's been happening here since I left
through Serena's blog and "Gossip Girl."
I can't believe Blair went through
with her marriage to Louis.
I really thought she was gonna end up with Chuck.
Yeah, between us,
I think she may have wanted to.
Let's just say while love is a very complicated thing,
so are prenups.
Speaking of love and prenups, uh, I have to go out
and pick up a few more things for Lily for tonight.
Uh, so stick around. She should be back soon.
See ya.
Thanks.
Thank you.
What are you doing here?
I'm supposed to meet a lovely elderly woman
who is going to tell me the joys of lifelong chastity,
But apparently she's late. What about you?
I'm meeting my book agent, who's also late.
Serena, I'm sorry. I should've--
Dan, please, we--we don't have to discuss this.
Let's just try to move past it, okay?
Okay.
Can I interest you both in a glass of dom, on the house?
It's a special Valentine's gift
to all of our guests.
Sure. I guess one glass wouldn't hurt.
It's not our fault our dates are late.
Step one is accomplished. The thaw has begun.
Like beautiful polish spring.
Now on to step two.
Really? She did?
No, I totally understand.
No, all right. Yeah.
Have a nice day, too.
What was that?
That was the catering company.
I specifically asked for Lola, that girl from the wedding,
but it turns out she has a note in her file
that says she can't work any events at "The spectator."
What did you do to her, Nathaniel?
Nothing. I didn't do anything.
She was the reason
I agreed to do the party in the first place.
Maybe I should just cancel the whole thing.
You're doing all this for a girl?
If she won't work a party at "The spectator,"
would she work one at the Empire?
Not if she knew I was throwing it, apparently.
As much as I absolutely loathe this day,
I can't deny my best friend a chance at true love.
I'll be overseeing
the usual festivities downstairs in the bar,
But I'll host your party up here,
and I'll even call the catering company myself.
Really? You don't mind?
That's great, man. Thank you.
Excuse me.
We just wanted to tell you
that we think you make a lovely couple.
Who? Who, us?
Oh, no, no, no. We're not.
Guess how many years we've been together.
54.
Come on. You're supposed to let them guess.
We were high school sweethearts.
Been together ever since.
Best 54 years of my life.
Sorry. I-I don't think we ordered this.
This is also on the house, for all our guests.
I don't see any other tables here with this dessert.
And it's strange that neither one of our meetings showed up.
Okay, Alexandra said someone left her a voice mail,
saying I was canceling.
Same with the virgin.
She called the office to reschedule.
Gee, I wonder who could be manipulative enough
to call all these people and get away with it.
It's too bad it's not Valentine's Day
more than once a year.
I could really make a serious go at this whole cupid thing.
Yes, "Operation: Darena" Going very smooth.
Now that they're actually talking again,
we just need to figure out a way to get them both
to Nate's party tonight.
Once they see each other in their old uniforms,
how could all those old feelings not come flooding back?
It's true. You never forget first love.
I remember Mine. Kazimierz.
Once, he took me out into sugar beet field...
Thank god.
Nate's party has been moved to the Empire.
I told Estee we'd stop by, but there's no way
I can bring a royal minder to my ex's apartment.
Looks like you'll just have to wear a school uniform
and play cupid in my place.
Oh, no.
This is very bad plan.
Damn! Nate's party has been moved to
a suite at the Empire.
So?
So he lives with Chuck.
I highly doubt Blair's gonna risk running into her ex
with a royal minder in tow,
which means when I drop my bum
the person it would hurt the most won't even be there.
Damn!
Oh, no.
This better not be someone telling me
that Serena's bailing, too.
I hooked up a doorman at the Van Der Woodsens'
with some free Knicks tickets a couple years ago.
Best decision I ever made.
I think he saw something that might be of interest to you.
Does she know that I'm gone?
Okay. Well, uh, tell her I'm running an errand,
and I'll be back in a few hours.
Okay, thanks.
I'm sorry, but, um, no one's home right now.
Charlotte Rhodes.
I'm hurt. You don't remember me?
I met you last year at the Constance party
when you were pretending to be mentally ill.
Although you're still hanging around here,
so maybe you really are.
Right.
Georgina, is it?
I gave you my number, but you never called,
which is why when I heard you were back in town,
I thought I'd come by and catch you in person,
especially since you have a habit
of bolting so quickly from places.
So...
What are you doing here?
Just in town for a brief visit, that's all.
Anybody know you're back?
Only Rufus and I'd appreciate it
if it stayed that way.
No problem.
Just... give me some gossip.
Or are you gossip enough?
Look, Georgina, I just got here. I don't know anything.
Aw. Come on now. You're part of the family.
You must know something.
All I know is that Blair and Louis
signed sort of a prenup, but in this town,
that's hardly news.
You know, you really should have called me.
We could've had a lot of fun.
Well, at least now I can.
Philip, find out who represents the Grimaldi family in New York
and meet me there.
Oh, and we're probably gonna have to file for divorce.
Looks like "Gossip Girl" just got her first valentine's day gift.
Hey! How was your lunch with the vestal virgin?
Helpful and informative or ghost of v-day future?
You can stop. I know that you canceled my interview
and set me up with Dan.
It was an act of goodwill.
Just because I can't have love in my own life
doesn't mean I shouldn't bring it to the people
who I care about most.
But Dan doesn't have feelings for me,
and--and there's nothing that will change that,
not some champagne or dazzling dessert.
Not even two fake old people in love?
They weren't real?
Actor's equity. But you're wrong.
Do you know what Dan said to me this morning?
Same thing you did.
His last good valentine's day was in high school--with you.
I'm telling you, there's still a glimmer of hope there.
That's never gonna happen, but thank you for trying.
Wait, wait, wait.
Why don't you come with me and my new royal minder
to the cardiac ball tonight?
We can bond over our mutual broken hearts
while looking at people with actual broken hearts.
Thank you. I think I'll just stay home,
eats lots of gelato, and write about how true love
is nothing but a myth.
Hey, I was in the neighborhood,
so I just wanted to stop by and tell you in person
I'm not gonna be able to make it tonight.
Come on, man. You, too?
Chuck's gonna be working. Blair and Serena are no-shows.
I mean, wh-what's up? You have a hot date or something?
Oh, hardly. Blair's trying to set me up with Serena,
which reminded me,
I didn't exactly have a great time in high school,
so I'm not eager to relive it.
Before you say "No," think about this.
There's gonna be grown women here dressed like schoolgirls.
I know. I'm sorry. I-I can't make it.
If it makes you feel any better...
I will totally sign your yearbook.
No, it doesn't.
What is it?
带布莱尔参加今晚的派对
It's, um, something strange.
我就泄露这个
Of course I love you, Chuck. I've always loved you.
I love you more and more every--
Um... you know what? On second thought,
I think I will come tonight. I mean, who doesn't like schoolgirls?
Yes!
Hello?
Have you heard from Lily?
It's getting late, and I really need to catch my flight.
Charlie, I feel terrible.
Her train was delayed, so she's headed straight
to, uh, the empire. I'm meeting her there now.
Can I swing by there on my way to the airport?
Do you wanna just call her?
No! It's really important.
Yeah. O-okay, okay, I'll tell her you're on your way.
I know. You're mad at me
for trying to set you up with Serena.
Actually, not really. We kinda had a nice time today,
which got me to thinking that there may be hope for us yet.
I knew it. I knew there was still something between you.
Now go ask her to Nate's party.
"Guitar hero" in one suite,
a sushi bar in the other.
Ah, a girl gets beaned with a Nairtini
用于酒吧倒在别人的头发上
or someone uses a secret key to sneak into the pool.
It's just like old times.
That sounds romantic, but I was thinking
it might be better to explore whatever future we might have
without the--the pressure of a real date, you know?
What do you mean?
Well, you did such a good job playing Cupid at lunch
that I thought you could do it again,
So why don't you come with us?
I would love to help, but I've suddenly got
this royal... pain in the ass from Monaco
who's watching my every move,
So I don't think it's such a good idea
for me to bring her to Chuck's.
No, what better place to bring her?
You could finally prove that Chuck is no longer a threat,
and Nate said he's probably not even gonna be there tonight.
Chuck won't be there?
No.
Fine. I'll make a swing by quickly
on the way to the Cardiac Ball,
but just to drop her and go, okay?
Thanks. I'll see you there.
I can't believe everything in Blair's prenup--
Money, chateaus, portraits.
Real estate, yachts, jewels.
She owns half a museum?
Pay dirt.
It says here Blair defaults on the marriage
in any way, the Waldorf family will owe the royals
so much money, they'll be bankrupt.
And this helps us how?
We're going to show the world
what Blair really thinks of her vows,
and we're gonna use Dan to do it.
Look out, B.
You may be trying to play Cupid,
but all the arrows are pointed right at you.
Okay, so please tell me again why we're here,
Why I'm dressed like this, and why you're not?
You told me your last good Valentine's day
was in high school, and since taking you
to an actual Constance/St. Jude party
felt wrong on too many levels,
I'm taking you to the next best thing--
a simulation.
Yeah, but I feel strange,
and people are looking at me.
Trust me, S. I have a big surprise for you tonight.
Isn't this your ex-boyfriend Charles Bass' hotel?
And we're coming here on Valentine's day?
I hardly think the royal family would--
Listen, Estee,
we are simply dropping by
so I can do one nice thing for a friend
before heading to the cardiac ball.
Chuck Bass is not a threat,
and I think it's important for the world to see...
Chuck, what are you doing here?
Just leaving. Enjoy your evening, ladies.
See that? We're friends now.
We've put it all behind us,
so feel free to alert the media if you want.
Classy party, Blair.
Is this the type
of dignified function I can be looking forward
to attending with you in the future?
Trust me, we'll be leaving momentarily.
Since Bass seems to be the issue here,
why don't I keep my eye on him?
Downstairs, with people not
wearing plaid or eating jell-o.
Hey, don't give me that look.
You said you didn't wanna work a party at "The spectator,"
so this isn't "The spectator."
Wait, wait, wait. Just hear me out, okay?
I think I did a pretty good job of addressing your concerns.
I mean, we're not having
some cheesy Valentine's date here, okay?
You get to see my world up close,
maybe change your mind about it,
and you don't have to miss work if you don't want to.
Come on. Just say a quick hello. You have to.
Serena would kill me if she knew that I saw you
and didn't drag you upstairs.
No, Dan, I told you, I really don't have time.
I need to go find Lily--
No, it's too late. Too late.
Hey, look who I saw racing through the lobby
as I was listening to St. Vincent? Good-bye.
Charlie, what are you doing here?
And where have you been for the past three months?
I know.
I just felt really overwhelmed and guilty about...
the car accident,
especially since Chuck and Blair were leaving my party
when it happened.
So I went back to Florida.
But, uh, you know, honestly,
I really shouldn't be here right now.
I came to apologize to your mom on my way to catching a flight.
Do you have her room?
I'll text her. Don't worry about it.
But first you have to tell me
all about your past three months
and--and what it's like living with Carol again.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
Okay, okay.
What are you doing?
Hold still. Serena really
digs that outsider thing.
So I'm helping.
B.T.W., this tie didn't work for you in high school,
and it doesn't work now.
So here's what I'm thinking.
take Serena somewhere quiet,
like--I don't know--
Nate's room or something.
Wait a second.
I really don't think I can go through with this.
You're really nervous, which is cute.
It is like high school all over again.
Listen, you have nothing to worry about, Dan.
Serena already likes you. You know that.
Look, I'm telling you,
just be your charming, wonderful self
like you've been with me all year.
You think I've been wonderful?
Are you kidding me?
Look at everything we've been through together.
You kept it a secret when I found out I was pregnant.
You shielded me from the world
so I could deal with my paternity test,
and you brought me to a priest in my darkest hour.
You wrote Louis' vows for him,
and then you saved me from my own wedding.
Do I need to go on?
No.
So...
If you're that guy with Serena,
how could she not love you?
You gonna make your move or what?
行动!快亲她!
I will be right back.
You really do. I mean it.
Charlie, welcome back.
Serena, can we talk?
Yeah, of course. Promise to call me
the moment you get back from Europe, okay?
I will. Promise.
Charlie!
Ivy! Ivy!
It's Charlotte Rhodes from Florida.
We took that acting class together.
Uh, yeah. Charlotte.
Hi.
It's good to see you.
What are you doing here?
I was about to ask you that same question.
So... Dan is looking for you.
Blair, that's not funny.
I'm not joking. That was my big surprise.
Unlike you, he thought your lunch date went great,
and he wants to explore things further.
Now I'm leaving, so go find him and see what happens.
Go!
Georgina.
You're "Gossip Girl"?
What? No.
No, that's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
Oh. Uh, okay. I'm not..."Gossip Girl."
I just... I work for her,
and believe me, the job is a lot harder than I thought.
Okay, look, your blackmailing days are over.
If you tell anyone that
I leaked that video of Blair and Chuck at her wedding,
then I'll tell everyone that you're Gossip Girl's henchman.
Don't you think you're overreacting here?
I mean, I was just trying to help your relationship along
by getting you to finally kiss Blair.
I couldn't handle the lack of action any longer.
All those endless pauses and pained stares.
So boring.
She wants you to kiss her, too.
The fact that you haven't just done it already
would be shocking if you weren't, well, you.
Dan.
Georgina.
What is going on?
Everything's fine.
Georgina was just leaving, weren't you?
Yes, I was. This party is so 2007 anyway.
What are you doing here? Aren't you supposed to be at some fancy gala?
I still have this.
And I just need to know one thing.
I sent Serena to look for you.
Am I just setting her up for disappointment?
Do you really want us to get back together?
I just want you to be happy.
Tell me what would make you happy, Dan.
Wait. Hey, Georgina!
Sorry, S.
Looks like your seven minutes in heaven
just turned into seven seconds from hell.
Charlie Trout.
Drinking by himself on Valentine's day.
Look out.
Do I know you?
Yeah. Alessandra.
We met at Dan's book party.
I have a vague memory.
Well, it's a good thing I have a vivid one.
I'm here with a bunch of single girlfriends,
And it is super depressing.
Buy me a drink.
Unless...
Forgive the drunken brazenness here,
but... what do you say we head off to your room
and make the rest of this dreadful holiday
go away together?
Thanks...
But maybe last year.
Oh, my God. What is wrong with me?
I was trying to get you two back together.
I thought that's what you both wanted.
It's not my fault he kissed me.
Not your fault?
What, you sound like you're still in high school.
Says the girl in the Constance uniform.
Did you not believe me that I didn't send that video in?
Of course I believed you.
Okay, well, then what is it?
What, you just wanna take away something that matters to me?
Did you even care about Dan?
B, how many times can we fight like this?
Aren't you sick of it?
They say people keep fighting about the same things
until it breaks them apart.
You know what? Maybe we're there.
There you are. We really have to go.
I couldn't agree more.
The last thing my mother ever wanted
was for me to be an actress,
let alone live in New York city,
So I applied to Julliard behind her back.
Now, well, she thinks I'm busy rushing sororities
in Michigan state, and I'm actually here,
taking classes and going by "Lola."
Just working jobs like this one
to make ends meet.
But what about you? Are you acting out here?
Yeah. Yeah, kind of.
I mean, you know, I-I got cast in this one part,
and it paid really well,
but it took a lot longer than I expected,
and it was way more complicated than I thought.
All right, has anyone ever told you two
how much you guys look alike?
I mean, you could almost be sisters.
My mom used to say the same thing.
You remember her, don't you?
No. No, not really.
And I didn't realize how late it was getting.
So I'm going to go.
You know, we should exchange numbers sometime.
Well, I'd say an apology is in order
after all your "I'm not comfortable in your world" talk,
because you totally knew someone at my party.
Yeah, you're right. You're right. I stand corrected.
But why was Ivy Dickens here anyway?
Oh, she's my friend's cousin.
Her real name's Charlie Rhodes.
I'm sorry. "Real name"?
Yeah. You didn't know?
Apparently, her mom is a crazy woman down in Florida
who made her go by the name "Ivy Dickens" growing up.
It must have been when you knew her.
But after last spring when she moved here
to live with her family,
she had to go by her real name.
And that name is... Charlie Rhodes?
Yeah. What?
Dan, give it--
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't just smash
this phone on the floor right now?
Fine. No problem.
I've already e-mailed myself the picture anyway.
Doesn't matter.
You can't do anything with it anyway,
'cause the second you do, we'll just out you
as the "Gossip girl" Spy you are.
I'm not her spy, you idiot.
I am her.
Watching you and Blair squirm with unfulfilled desire
is way more fun than any damage one picture could cause.
What does that mean?
It means that the girl you love finally gave you a sign
that she likes you back,
and there's not a damn thing
either of you can do about it
without destroying not only Blair's marriage
but her family's entire financial future.
Her family? I don't understand.
She didn't tell you about her prenup?
If Blair defaults in her marriage in any way,
The dowry she'd owe would bankrupt Eleanor.
And, sweetie,
if Blair hated you for being poor before,
imagine how much she'd hate you for making her poor, too.
I have something I think you'd like to see.
And in your bedroom, no less.
Has she no decency?
Anyway, Happy Valentine's Day.
Blair! Blair, wait a second.
Just give me one more minute, okay? Sorry.
Why didn't you tell me about the prenup?
Is that why you went back with Louis?
I just can't risk my family's future like that.
I have no choice but to stay trapped in my marriage
for at least a year.
So your feelings for Louis...
Are all business.
How about your feelings for me?
Because that kiss-- it wasn't like last year.
You--you kissed me back. I felt it.
Doesn't matter what you think you felt,
because Serena's my best friend,
and I would never do anything to hurt her.
I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression.
Have a happy valentine's day.
Amazing.
You got exactly what you wanted.
So what are you waiting for? Use it.
If I post this picture, Dan will out me.
And I'm not sure I'm willing to give up being "Gossip Girl"
over one little kiss.
So what are we gonna do?
Dan knows how Blair feels about him now,
which means the more they can't,
the more they'll want to.
It won't be long before
they're doing far worse things than kissing.
Speaking of...
I'm kinda digging this whole high school look.
Oh, well, it is valentine's day, and you have been
uncharacteristically helpful today.
Sure. Why not?
Oh, not it.
I know I promised you all I'd expose a giant secret today,
and I didn't deliver,
but isn't that what valentine's day is all about...
Hopes dashed? Feelings hurt?
Relationships severed?
It's a day filled with crushing disappointments.
I want you to know I'm interested
in more than your body, Alessandra.
I'm interested in your work, too.
Tell me, what's it like being a book agent
and working with my good friend Dan?
Where it's easy to take advantage
of the vulnerable and lonely.
While some continue to pine
over those great unrequited loves.
Others can't help
but feel like they somehow got totally screwed.
How was your aunt?
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to finish it.
How is she doing? Is she okay?
I'm worried there's not much time left.
She really cares about you.
Wouldn't stop talking about you while you were gone.
Mrs. Rhodes is up right now if you'd like to talk to her.
And while it'd be nice to believe
that most Valentine's days end well,
we all know they are far more likely to end in heartbreak.
