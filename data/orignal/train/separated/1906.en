The waiting can kill you.
You make a decision,
and then the world has to turn.
The consequences unfold...
out of your hands.
There's only one thing that seems clear...
in those quiet moments while you wait.
Whatever you chose was wrong.
You think he put you in his will?
No.
Next of kin.
Maybe you get the house.
I have a house.
Well, you can give me his house. I mean, I could use a house.
He's not my father.
I've been telling him this for years.
He just feels guilty
because he busted up my parents' marriage.
That's not my problem.
It is now.
Yeah, I mean, sticking me with his end of life care--
Doesn't ask, doesn't give me an out--
That's real love.
Well, it sounds like family to me.
Maybe he is your father. Banged your mom enough.
Alex.
Did they know each other before you were born?
They met when I was 3.
Mm-hmm. Yeah. That's what they told you.
I gotta get back to the E.R.
Ow. Oh, no, no. Let me get it.
This is Yang.
And how about Brooks?
I know. I'm fine.
Hey, look. I need to run to my nec fasc surgery.
He's in cardiogenic shock.
No.
Bailey feels like there's likely some internal necrosis.
So she took him up to the O.R.
With this kind of cardiac compromise?
Yeah--and she--
Unh-unh. She--mom. Mom?
Look...
I need Hunt in here.
I can try to--
Now!
Ready? Go. Two, three...
Bowels are completely clean.
Should we recheck the pelvis?
I have, four times.
What the hell do you think you're doing--
Cutting open a man in cardiogenic shock
with nothing on his C.T.?
There's dead tissue somewhere inside him.
I'd like to find it before it kills him.
He can't handle this stress
until his cardiac status is stabilized!
Get him off that table!
Lap pad, please.
Dr. Hunt!
Dr. Avery, I'm gonna have to ask you
to keep it down while we're doing our work.
Huh, there's a surprise for you.
Pressure's dropping. Is his dopamine maxed out?
Yeah, it's at 20.
Close the patient!
Come on. Where are you?
Dr. Hunt! Brooks is crashing.
Bailey, he's having runs of V-tach.
Close... him... up!
Closing.
Can you get by without me?
Just go.
Hey, how's it going with Brooks?
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You gotta drink the juice, man.
You give us half your blood and head back to the pile,
you're gonna pass out.
Heather didn't make it.
Come on.
I'm gonna give the interns the rest of the night off.
Can you give me a hand if there's anything they drop?
Of course.
I'm so sorry about Heather.
Yeah.
Dr. Hunt, Lydia's desatting,
decreased breath sounds on the left.
Wha--
Sharpie lady.
Oh. Should I throw in a chest tube?
Dr. Yang is gonna take over that case.
Why? I can handle a chest tube.
Oh, my god.
I got a woman with necrotizing fasciitis,
and the interns aren't operating.
So can you--
Of course.
Well, she's already on the table,
and the anesthesiologists are lining her up.
Be ready in ten.
Okay. Hey...
It's just terrible.
Jackson.
Oh, hey. I'm sorry.
And what about Richard?
Still critical,
but his pressure stabilized once Bailey closed.
So Bailey closed because his vitals tanked,
or because Catherine Avery was in the gallery screaming?
Oh, Derek.
You heard about Brooks?
I can't believe it.
Can we have a conversation?
Not now.
I know you're mad.
And telling everyone-- I guess...
I deserved that.
But we could just--
I said not now.
Hey, it's right behind me!
Are you headed back out?
Be careful, okay?
It was Avery, right?
He's the guy that you...
I get it. He's a good-looking guy.
Practically runs the hospital.
Matthew--
And I proposed to you in front of a hundred people.
I didn't really give you the opportunity to say "No."
So...
Did you want to say "No"?
Callie?
Callie?
Callie?!
We got the clot out,
but there was just so much swelling.
Couldn't get it to stop.
Did you tell the family?
Yeah, I had someone call her mom when we found her
and tell her that she was injured.
She's coming down from someplace in Oregon.
I just didn't want to tell her
when she was still on the road.
Okay, so you need to go to the day care
and pick up Zola because she's gonna think
we had a baby and forgot about her.
I'll call the babysitter and tell her
to meet you at the house in an hour.
And you should tell the interns
to hang out and wait till Heather's mom arrives.
Give me the baby.
Okay.
I know.
That is a lot of blood.
Should I book an O.R.?
No, not yet.
We'll monitor her for the next couple of hours
and then decide.
My--my house.
Ma'am, you've lost quite a lot of blood.
You should rest.
I-I wouldn't worry about the house right now.
You can't scream at my doctors when there is
an open body on the table.
I can't believe you let her talk you into
a boondoggle like that.
Dr. Avery, if you have any issues with--
Does he know why you cut open a man in severe cardiac distress
just so you could poke around and see what's going on?
We looked at all of the options.
Tell him.
You tell him you feel guilty
because the last thing Richard Webber heard from you
is that he's a drunk who ruined your life,
after all he's done for you.
We talk on the phone for an hour every night.
It came up.
You feel bad, go find a priest.
But do not try to fix it with a Hail Mary.
That very well may kill the man!
I want acces to his charts... right now.
I'll be back in about an hour.
Heather's mother won't probably be here yet,
but if she is, uh, someone stay with her
until I get back.
We don't tell her, do we?
No, I will.
Just think of some good Heather stories.
Once she knows,
she's gonna want to know that she died among friends.
Who's gonna wait?
I can't. I can't. She'll see it in my face.
What the hell is his problem? It's not like they were friends.
I am not waiting with her alone.
I'm not either.
Okay. Nobody goes. We all wait.
Now go find Shane and tell him we're doing this together.
What are you, my mother? You find him.
Yes, yes, yes.
Hey.
Hey,can you watch her for a minute?
Yeah.
I need to get my laptop.
Come here.
What's going on?
My wife's an s-l-u-t.
Sofia and I are spending the night at a hotel.
And then what?
I don't know. Okay, I'll be right back.
We're gonna let her stay at a hotel?
So is this the woman
whose fiance is also a firefighter,
but they couldn't find him for a while?
Yep.
Forceps.
Wow, this wound is really deep.
To get good margins, we're gonna have to--
I got it.
You are one sleepy girl.
I'm gonna get you to bed right now.
I was gonna go to a hotel.
But Mer said I should come here.
Well, I guess I should have read those five text messages.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. Sofia's asleep in Zola's bed--
And I-I can move her. She--
She probably won't wake up.
Yeah, okay.
Catherine may be right. I mean, it's possible
I'm too close to this to see it clearly.
Am I supposed to be seeing this clearly?
Well, Yang was advocating for a more conservative approach.
I guess that's what we go with.
Catherine's reviewing his chart--
labs, I don't know.
If she wants to make the decisions,
then maybe she should.
Here you go.
Thanks.
Hey, how is she doing?
Well, I-I put in the chest tube.
One of her broken ribs sliced into her lung.
So, I mean, she put out a lot of blood.
We're watching her.
Okay.
How are you?
Fabulous.
Yeah.
What?
Nothing.
What?
I-I just...
I wish I had known it was gonna be
the last time you and I were together.
I would have done things a little differently.
Well, was the last time bad?
No, the last time was Wednesday,
when we knocked that plate off the counter,
and I spent half the night pulling shards of glass
out of your foot.
That was not the last time.
It was?
Not our best work.
Well, that's awful.
After the kind of run we had...
It's just a shame.
Shameful.
Everyone I love either cheats on me or dies.
Callie...
Or cheats on me and dies.
George did both.
Arizona's not gonna die.
Yeah, that doesn't make me feel any better.
Ugh. I'm sorry. I'm drinking all your wine.
You should be drinking all your wine
after what you went through tonight with Heather and...
and Richard, oh, my god!
Why is everything so horrible?
Please, it's okay. Go ahead.
It's all yours.
Okay.
I'll open another bottle.
Just page her!
I can't page someone 911 without the name of the patient--
Andrea.
When Dr. Torres calls in, she'll expect to know who--
No, there's no patient. Just page her.
We can't page 911 without a patient emergency.
Look at me. Does it look like this is not an emergency?
Hey, hey! What's going on?
What's going on?
I need you to page Callie 911.
Why?
Because she took off with my baby,
and I don't know where,
and when I call her, she doesn't pick up.
All right, did she...
No, just do it!
So we were able to remove all of the necrotic tissue,
but the labs suggest
that your organs are beginning to fail.
Well, is there anything that you can do?
Well, we're giving you some powerful antibiotics.
And we're hoping that that stops the process.
But...
but I might not make it.
We are going to do everything that we possibly can.
Bri...
We want to get married now.
Right now no matter what happens,
we want to be married.
We need a chaplain.
Hey, Bailey.
Arizona is in the lobby
screaming at nurses.
Why?
'Cause she has no idea where Callie is...
or the baby.
Oh, well, you need to tell her they're at my house.
Callie's not a battered woman.
We're not harboring her until she gets a restraining order.
She just wants some space.
But you don't think Arizona's called her,
like, 300 times?
If Callie wanted her to know where she was,
she'd have-- she'd have told her.
You think it's okay that Arizona
doesn't know where her baby is?
She's Sofia's mom, too.
They're both our friends.
You know, we shouldn't take sides.
It's not taking sides to tell Arizona where her kid is.
Oh, you think that's how it's gonna go?
What happened to your hair?
She wasn't funny funny, but she was weird funny.
We're not saying that to her mom.
Remember when she swallowed that marble?
We could talk about that.
Her mom knows she swallowed a marble, idiot.
You know what?
When you have a better idea, you let me know.
You were her roommate.
How do you not have a single nice story about her?
She took my white sweater and returned it pink.
She left the apartment without waking me up
when we both had rounds, which she knew about and said,
"I didn't want to bother you. You looked so peaceful."
She'd drink all the milk
and return the empty carton back in the fridge.
Then why are you all red-eyed and puffy?
We weren't soul mates.
It doesn't mean I wanted her dead.
What's going on with the baby?
Oh, nothing. He's fine.
They have him in the nursery.
Oh. Oh. I thought--
I thought something happened.
No, no.
I paged you because I wanted to let you know
that Callie and Sofia are going to stay at my place tonight.
I think she just needs some space.
She needs to cool off. And... I know
you're not gonna go run over there or anything,
but I just thought you would like to know
that she and the baby are--
Arizona.
Arizona?!
Is "I told you so" inappropriate?
Shut it.
Come on. What about... Hassan?
He's out at the pile, too?
You realize they can't all be out at the damn pile.
No, I don't care what religion they are.
Just give me somebody--anybody that can officiate this--
Yeah, as a member of the board, I'm gonna say
you want to stay away from phrases like,
"Even a Catholic."
All right, uh, just call me back.
How is Richard?
Hanging by a thread. Thank you very much.
You gonna scream at me, too, now?
I heard you already had a go at Hunt and Bailey.
I just wanna know what in god's name
was going on through your head--
Stop!
You are terrified. I get that.
You love him.
And you are as scared as you have ever been.
Marching through this hospital
telling everybody they are incompetent
is not gonna fix that situation.
We are all doing our best.
And we are gonna take good care of him.
And we... are gonna take good care of you.
Okay?
As soon as he's stable...
As soon as the storm passes,
I'm going to move him to another hospital.
I'm gonna do a thoracotomy on Lydia.
Just waiting for an O.R. to open up.
Okay.
So thanks for... before.
"Thanks"?
Are you gonna send a card on pretty stationery?
I'm just glad...
that we've given each other a better last memory.
What?
I don't know.
If we'd really thought it through,
then for the last time we'd have--
What?
Is he in there?
I can't see anything.
Keep your voices down. She's sleeping.
No, she's not.
Oh. Sorry, um,
We were just looking for Dr. Shepherd.
He's not here.
He'll be back. He went to take Zola home.
What do you need?
He asked us to come up with something nice to say
about Heather to her mom for after she knows.
We're having trouble coming up with
something that's appropriate.
We were thinking if we looked at
some of the cases she worked on with Dr. Shepherd,
we could talk about those.
Her mother is not gonna give a crap
about her glioblastoma.
She wants to hear about how you loved her
and how she was like your family.
Nothing?
Doesn't have to be deep.
When my friend George died, I told his mother a story
about how he stole us all jell-o cups.
and then he dropped them all over the floor
and made a huge mess.
And then he tried to clean it up
with those blue bed pads, which only made it worse
because, of course, those blue bed pads
aren't absorbent at all.
It's not a sonnet, but it made her smile.
And then she went back to crying.
Okay.
Asleep?
What do you think?
My mother's planning on moving Richard to another hospital.
What?
I know.
I know you weren't sure about how to handle
Richard's medical decisions, but I'm just telling you,
you turn the reins over to her,
that's exactly what she's gonna do with them.
Okay... get me a wheelchair.
You just had a splenectomy and a child.
I'm not putting you in a wheelchair.
Jackson, just get me a wheelchair.
There are no chaplains anywhere in the building.
Everyone is out dealing with storm victims.
We have storm victims right here.
What--chaplains are supposed to stay here!
Anybody seen my patient Brian?
Firefighter, busted ribs...
Yeah, he's getting married.
Not without a chaplain, he's not.
Well, I can go online and get certified by
that place on the internet, but me and weddings,
today-- I don't think that I'm the best choice.
The damn firefighters keep taking off--injured.
If you see any of them,
tell them to stay in their damn beds.
Kepner.
What?
Get me a wheelchair.
April!
I don't think we can be friends.
Really?
This will keep happening.
I...
really wanted to be able to work with you.
Yeah, of course.
But if we...
you know, talk on the phone or...
grab lunch...
Just because I'm the one
who said it was time...
doesn't mean this is easy for me.
I know.
This is not easy for me.
What do you really believe
is the best course of treatment?
It's not that simple.
Yes, it is.
You always taught us, when you know, you know.
I think there is something in there,
and no matter how much it stresses his heart,
I think letting it get worse is worse.
Hi. This is Dr. Grey.
I need to book an O.R. for an exploratory laparotomy.
Surgeon is Bailey.
Patient is Webber.
They're opening him up again.
Yep. Don't say anything.
I'm not.
She thought it was a stupid idea the first time
and even more stupid the second time.
You're the one who has to decide
what Richard would want. Wouldn't want to be you.
Thanks.
But to be clear,
when you're making these decisions for me,
give my heart at least 24 hours to recover
before you cut me stem to stern.
You just couldn't hold it in, could you?
Wait, she's your health care proxy?
I get to make the decisions for everyone.
Not Qwen?
No.
Who's yours?
I never filled out the forms.
I had the papers back when it was gonna be Izzie.
That was a bad plan.
That was all a bad plan.
Why do you think I never turned them in?
Mer could be yours, too.
You think I make the wrong decisions all the time.
I don't know why you're selling me to him.
Will you stop being so insecure?
Just because I disagree with you
doesn't mean I don't respect what you think.
I can hold more than one point of view in my mind.
I am mature.
I don't believe you.
You can be mine.
Health care proxy? Really?
I mean, Mer's got enough to take care of.
You want extraordinary measures
or should I just unplug you?
Use your judgment.
Sharpie lady's ready.
Mom!
You knew they were taking him back into the O.R.?
Right, now you can't march in there and shut 'em down.
The hell I can't.
He didn't choose you to make his decisions.
He chose Meredith.
How's the E.R.?
Quiet for a while.
But we got a couple of ambulances on their way in--
People they pulled out of the pile.
Can I come?
No, no. You're supposed to be working.
I don't need the night out.
We're supposed to be sitting around
telling Heather stories.
Turns out we're not a very tight group.
You think you're not.
But when it all hits the fan...
You'll be glad you have 'em.
Someone just died. Shouldn't this be the time?
Come on.
You're not gonna go cry to them when we break up...
and you have to move your trash bag full of crap
out of my house?
Okay, one--
I never leave more than a change of underwear
and a toothbrush in anyone else's house.
That's smart.
And two--I will have dumped your sorry ass,
so I'm not gonna be crying.
I'm just gonna feel bad
that I made it so you can never love again.
Oh, yeah. It's gonna be ugly.
But see...
I've got Mer and Cristina.
I can cry to them.
When the next guy after me breaks your heart...
I'm gonna want my bitches.
Voila!This--it'll help.
Brian and Sasha...
Your commitment
to each other is an inspiration.
Your love, your devotion-- it's unwavering.
You aren't swayed by anything
that life puts in your path.
When people talk about marriage,
this is exactly what they oughta have in mind.
I can't believe I yelled at a woman
who clawed dying victims out of the mud
and triaged them with her bleeding little hands.
Super tacky.
I think I'm the worst person I've ever met.
Shut up.
It speaks.
It wants more booze.
All right.
All right, we all have to focus.
Heather.
She was a fine, upstanding citizen
with limitless potential.
You say that to my mom when I'm dead,
and she's gonna know you're lying.
My mom will believe it.
You can say it when I'm dead.
Write it down 'cause I'm gonna forget.
That I was a nice person?
How is it that we spend this much time together
and we don't really know anything about each other?
So tell us something we don't know.
About me?
Don't be shy.
What?
I can't.
You guys are gonna hate me more than you already do.
No, we won't.
Circle of trust.
My mom knew Mark Sloan.
The one who died?
They, like, dated a hundred years ago or something.
And he kind of helped me get into the program.
What?!
I knew it.
I knew you didn't make it in here on your own.
You are such an evil cow.
Whatever.
At least I got in here on my own merit.
What happened to the circle of trust?
I was a street kid.
Foster homes, lived in my car.
You were not.
Hand to god.
Really? Do you know how to pickpocket?
No. I wasn't Oliver Twist.
Could you teach me how to shoplift?
No!
It'll help me in the O.R. Calm hands under pressure.
You couldn't handle it.
You could.
Thank you.
I... went through college on a cheerleading scholarship.
What?!
No!
Yes.
That is my child!
okay, so I can screw some whore on shore leave,
but this is over the line?
I could have called the police on you--
Okay, and now she's your baby.
I had to talk you into even considering having a child.
And I had to talk you into marriage.
Yeah, because I knew it would be a mistake.
And you know what? It was.
You cannot take a baby and just disappear...
Look at the stars and the sky light.
Yeah? Yeah, should we go ups--
Let's go to the swing. Should we go to the swing?
Okay. Go to the swing.
Go to the swing. Let's go to the swing.
We are excited, united...
And here to win the fight.
We're here to meet you, defeat you...
We dominate tonight!
Tigers...
Tigers...
Tigers.
Tigers.
Tigers.
Excuse me,
somebody said you might be able to help me
find my daughter
Heather Brooks.
We have run this bowel four times now,
and there is nothing there.
I don't know how much longer we can keep at this.
Come on.
I know you're in there.
Owen.
Oh, my god.
The pancreas. Look at that.
That's all necrotic tissue hiding underneath.
Get her some forceps, please.
And--and a 15-blade.
Here you go, doctor.
Somebody call Meredith Grey up in maternity.
On it.
Tell her, "when you know, you know"!
It was a beautiful wedding.
What you said--
Can we not?
Why are you snapping at me all day?
I'm not snapping.
Yeah, you are.
I'm sorry I asked the question.
It obviously made you really uncomfortable,
and I guess that's my answer.
There's no need to beat a dead horse.
That's what it's supposed to look like, you know.
I mean, they can't even imagine not being together.
Do you see the difference between that
and "I think I'll marry this guy,
or maybe I'll marry that guy,
who I banged in a bathroom
because I flipped out over my boards,
but when he was into me, I couldn't handle it.
but suddenly, when he almost dies,
I can't live without him."
That is so unfair!
It's what happened!
You didn't want me when I was okay--
when I wanted you.
No, you just want me now
because you are in something that is real...
and that--
that scares the crap out of you.
Marry this guy because you want to make a life with him,
or don't, and move on.
But none of this has to do with me.
No, this is...
entirely about you.
I'm very sorry about how I spoke to you yesterday.
With the storm and everything, and we're all just...
Your house...
It didn't make it, did it?
I'm sorry.
You saved a lot of people triaging like you did.
Were you a doctor or something?
No, I've just lived on the side of the mountain
for a long time. It's...
It's not our first storm.
An ex-marine showed me how to do it...
our first mudslide.
Oh, I can't believe I have to build that house again.
Maybe you should find someplace else.
No. We're a few houses on the side of a mountain,
and we take care of each other.
I'm sure you'd find new friends.
No one else would have me.
She was really good.
Fast hands.
One time...
we'd all been working all night,
and we were starving,
and she went to where they make the food trays
for the patients,
and she stole Jell-O cups for all of us.
And they fell all over the floor.
She tried to use one of those blue hospital pads
to clean it up, but it just made it worse.
Got everywhere.
Jo told Heather that
she swiped an apple from a grocery store
when she was a kid.
And Heather asked her to teach her how to shoplift.
She thought it would improve her surgical technique.
You must have been close.
April, I really don't have time for this.
Please just-- just... please.
I want to accept your proposal...
in private,
without anybody pressuring me to say "yes."
And I want to do it in front of God.
Actually--actually, no, you know what? No.
I-I'm not accepting your proposal,
I am proposing to you.
I want to be your wife.
I think you need to think some stuff out.
I did.
Okay.
Yes, it was Jackson.
And... yes, I-I have feelings for him.
He's always gonna be a part of my life.
And that gets confusing sometimes,
especially when he's
pulling babies out of burning buses.
But...
I... I-I'm not good at this.
I--this is all new to me.
Okay, I was never the girl that got picked at the dance.
I-I-I'm not good at it,
and I'm indecisive
because I see eight sides of everything.
And that's what you're picking when you pick me.
And you may not want that.
I thought maybe nobody would ever want that.
April--
But I... I want you.
I want to marry you.
So will you marry me?
Sofia is downstairs in the day care.
I'm sorry I called you a baby-snatcher.
I was upset,
and I shouldn't have spoken to you like that.
You were just trying to cool off,
and that was the right thing to do--
Sofia and I will be staying at Mer's again tonight.
That'll be two nights with me.
You can take her the following two nights.
And we'll switch off like that
until we can figure out a real schedule.
Well, how long is-- is this gonna be going on?
I don't know.
Dr. Ben Warren,
this is your wife.
Sorry... I keep missing you. It's--
It's been...
Something happened with Richard--
A health situation.
I got involved in that.
He's still unconscious.
I don't know how he's going to...
But he's alive.
Heather's uncle just arrived.
He's with her mom, and her brother's on his way.
Thank you for staying with her.
Go home. Get some rest.
You need to tell your guys
to stop going out to the damn pile if they're injured.
I keep patching up the same damn guys.
I could tell 'em, but it's not gonna make any difference.
They can't just sit around.
It... makes them nuts.
All right, try harder!
Where's the rig?
You okay? You sure?
Okay. Out back.
Hey, sir?
Can I ride out there with you guys?
Sure.
What are you doing? Shane!
Shane, you're not a firefighter!
Shane!
Stupid.
Damn it.
What are you doing?
We're his people. We have to go.
Uh, actually, no, we don't. We're
not trained--
Sharpie lady helped.
Sharpie lady almost got herself killed.
We have to go.
I don't know what the deal is with him and Heather.
I don't know if it's their weird competition thing.
Or maybe they were having secret sex in the bathrooms.
I don't care. Whatever it is,
Shane hasn't said a single word since she died,
and we're what he has. We're what we have.
Maybe we get through this program normal.
Or maybe we end up cranky, work-obsessed people
who live on the side of a mountain
and have no family or children,
and we only have each other
because no one else can stand us.
What is she talking--
get up!
E-everything okay?
Yeah. Yeah, uh,
Meredith just wants me to hang out at her house.
Zola needs some attention.
And Derek is pretty wiped out.
Callie and Sofia are there, so...
Is there anything I can do? I mean, I could, uh...
Good night.
Yeah.
Zola is asleep.
All right, little miss...
In five minutes, it's your turn.
To be clear, I am happy to do the dishes,
but there is no universe in which I generate dinner.
All right, we'll figure it out.
Mac and cheese.
Oh, no, we had that last night.
Well, and it was good. Right? It was good.
Oh, thank you.
I'm sorry to bother everybody.
No, it's okay.
Can I see her for just a minute?
You saw her this afternoon. You can get her tomorrow night.
I know.
But cou--
You can see her when it's your night.
I could, uh... I could just take her on the--
on the front porch for a minute,
and I'm not gonna take her.
Do you have any idea how confusing this is for her?
Yeah, I realize that.
Well, you know what?
She's supposed to be in bed right now.
How am I supposed to get her to sleep
with you coming and going?
Five minutes.
Are you kidding me?
She shows up here with this act,
and you're just gonna take her side?
Callie--
It's an act.
Callie, look at me.
I'm your friend.
Five minutes.
Come here, Sofia.
Come here, baby. Okay. Yeah.
Whee! come on, baby.
We just want to survive the storm.
I missed you so much.
We pray,
"please, God, just get me to the other side."
We never imagine what it'll be like when we get there.
I love you so much.
And I miss you every second.
'cause you're my girl.
What if when the storm passes, nothing's left?
I always said I could handle anything.
I was wrong.
I was wrong about a lot of things.
I think there's no harm in getting another opinion.
Was I or was I not correct?
Why does that make you feel so threatened?
You know, I'm another opinion, and I have to tip my hat.
Dr. Bailey called it.
Nobody said it wasn't good to deal with the pancreas,
but he is still clearly unstable.
He hasn't regained consciousness--
None of that is unusual.
I would like to bring in another person--
somebody that could tell us
I will make the decision.
You've said what you think, and then you said it again.
And I will take that under advisement.
Dr. Grey--
He picked you to be his girlfriend.
And we're all very happy about that.
But he picked me to be his family.
And you walked away from that responsibility
the second that--
No one said I would be good at it.
And he knew that. But he picked me anyway.
I'm the family.
Meredith.
Please, don't get involved.
