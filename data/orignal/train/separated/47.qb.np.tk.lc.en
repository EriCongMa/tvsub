i was the same way , bad things just happen .
no rhyme or reason .
but , sometimes there is a reason , it &apos;s just not a reason you can see .
umm , this is wonderful , you have to give me the recipe .
thank you .
i may not see the air is polluted ,
but that doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s not .
i may not see the poison in the ground
but it &apos;s still there .
i went to alicia because we didn &apos;t cause this laurie
this was done to us .
so , do you have any questions ?
who else signed up ?
the pesticides were buried here and here .
a hundred and two families affected in all .
i &apos;ve spoken to half so far
and i &apos;ll speak to the rest by the end of the week .
and what happens if i do sign ?
then we &apos;ll bring suit to j &amp; l pesticides
they were negligent .
they could have disposed of their chlorodine reserves properly .
instead , they buried them near your groundwater .
this won &apos;t cost you anything . my firm only makes money if we are successful .
you can come .
i wanted three girls .
i was an only child and i wanted noise in the house ...
lots of noise .
i &apos;m twenty @-@ six years old and i will never have a baby .
never .
are you a mom ?
yes i am
if you &apos;re planning to sue these people ,
i &apos;ll do whatever you want i &apos;ll testify whatever you want , cry whenever you want
but it &apos;s not for the money .
i want them to know that they hurt me .
ok ?
ok .
would you excuse me ?
she &apos;s a good one .
i know .
yeah ?
how &apos;s it going ?
good but slow . everybody &apos;s wary here .
they &apos;ll climb aboard when they smell the money .
i don &apos;t think so . it &apos;s a conservative neighborhood .
they don &apos;t like lawyers .
that &apos;s why i sent you .
we got the preliminary report back of the core samples .
it &apos;s looking like this could reach pretty high .
$ 55 million .
you &apos;re kidding .
nope . you &apos;re going to change a lot of lives out there .
just keep signing them up . call me when you &apos;re done .
what did she say ?
she said we &apos;re good .
how sweet . you two have made up .
isn â€² t it adorable ? so , are you on board ?
if it means getting bond out , i am .
otherwise , i am out the door headed to another firm .
it &apos;s about getting bond out .
there &apos;s only one way to replace a name partner--
a majority vote of the equity partners .
the next partner meeting is friday .
bond thinks i &apos;m on his side , so he won &apos;t expect anything .
and then diane asks for and end @-@ of @-@ the @-@ meeting good faith vote .
bond will think i &apos;m just being spiteful .
so he won &apos;t have time to line up his troops .
and you have the votes ?
well , we have my people , will &apos;s people and yours , right ?
family law &apos;s ? sure , they &apos;re ready to lynch him .
an unfortunate choice of words .
we need to get julius into this
so it doesn &apos;t look like the racist white partners ...
oh , please .
what do you mean , oh , please ?
i &apos;m worried we &apos;re soft on four votes :
wolf , adams , howard , neka .
minus those four votes ,
we &apos;re short of a majority .
so we get them back on the reservation .
back on the reservation ?
isn &apos;t neka half cherokee ?
look , the only thing equity partners care about is year @-@ end bonuses .
so we need to give them a piece of this new class action .
$ 55 million is a lot of incentive .
are you sure the $ 55 million is real ?
it &apos;s a consent form , julie .
just a formality for the court .
i like you , mrs. florrick .
but that was my friend gail on the phone .
she thinks i should listen
to this other lawyer before i decide .
what other lawyer ?
at annette &apos;s house .
right now ?
do you mind if we tag along ?
looks like we have competition .
i don &apos;t know who it is .
false alarm .
the other firm sent a car and driver .
talk about tone @-@ deaf .
this community &apos;s gonna hate him .
i just don &apos;t like the feeling we &apos;re being exploited , that &apos;s all .
there are a lot of lawyers out there
just looking to make a quick buck .
but i know what it &apos;s like to be exploited .
people see you as a victim , and they want to use that .
they don &apos;t see pain
unless it &apos;s something that can packaged and sold .
look at me .
oh , hi , julie , rosanna .
and mrs. florrick .
she asked if she could drop by , too .
now , now , don &apos;t want any lawyer fights in here .
no , no . mrs. florrick and i are old friends .
aren &apos;t we ?
we are .
louis was just telling us he has ...
tardive dyskinesia .
it &apos;s a neurological syndrome .
if you see me moving like this or like this ,
don &apos;t think ms. florrick has me worried .
in fact , i &apos;m glad alicia &apos;s here .
i know i should probably be telling you
she &apos;s the devil incarnate ,
and her firm is going to screw up your class action ,
but we &apos;re both very capable lawyers ,
and i think you should just go with the firm
that you think has your best interests at heart .
and who is your firm these days , mr. canning ?
well , that would be me .
i &apos;m it . one employee .
low overhead .
this crumb cake is incredible .
and the town car and driver outside ,
who pays his salary ?
i guess i do .
i ... i can &apos;t drive anymore .
i wish i could , but ...
i need that , to have a driver .
that &apos;s okay .
my brother was in an accident last year .
a taxi ran over his leg . he can &apos;t drive either .
that &apos;s terrible .
this is what i love about
coming into homes like this-- is the acceptance .
this is what america has more than any other country--
acceptance .
so you &apos;re working for the pesticide industry now .
why would you say that ?
history .
last time we met ,
you gloated about helping big pharmaceutical .
yes , and you defended the wife @-@ killer colin sweeny .
so you save jnl money by stealing our class action
and negotiating a lowball settlement .
very smart .
mrs. florrick , you seem like such a nice woman on the outside ,
and then i get this glimpse of the darkness within .
you &apos;re going to have
to try harder this time around . i &apos;m on to you .
it helped you in there .
they loved it when you attacked my car .
there can only be one class action .
yes . i &apos;ll see you in court .
no ! no !
yes . just consider it foreplay .
well , then you have to find it .
yeah , what &apos;s up ?
oh , i have this deposition ...
then there &apos;s this continuance ...
well , don &apos;t worry about it .
the judge will never ...
no , no .
all right , i &apos;ll be right in .
you know what i think ? i think you &apos;re gay .
i think your gay lover phones every time
we &apos;re about to have sex and calls you away .
oh , yeah ?
i &apos;ll have you two over for dinner sometime .
all rise .
good morning . and welcome .
uh , before we begin today ,
i want to remind everybody about the ... blood drive .
i don &apos;t want to hand down any declarations ,
but blood supplies are low ,
so i leave it to you and your conscience .
now , i understand that we have a disagreement
over a class certification .
ms. lockhart , you are looking formidable today ?
yes , your honor .
we represent the community of fallstrom
in their suit against jnl pesticides ,
over a recent infertility and miscarriage cluster ,
and we &apos;re asking you to certify our class .
and yet there seems to be an overlapping contention .
mr. canni-- canning , is it ?
yes , your honor .
hello .
hi .
being new to your court ,
i should probably explain a few things .
this movement that you see ,
i have a syndrome called tardive dyskinesia ,
and it results in these uncontrollable movements .
that &apos;s good to know .
my sister @-@ in @-@ law suffers from huntington &apos;s .
huntington &apos;s . oh , my gosh .
yes , it requires a bravery that i couldn &apos;t imagine .
i commend you , sir , for even being in this court .
oh , no , please ...
one foot in front of the other .
i very much doubt that .
oh , dear god .
and so you want to represent this class , is that right ?
yes , i &apos;ve signed up several of the neighbors in fallstrom ,
and i believe i &apos;ll be
the strongest advocate in the case against jnl .
your honor ,
until very recently , mr. canning was in @-@ house counsel
at mrg pharmaceuticals .
for the last eight years ,
he successfully defeated class actions
identical to this one .
it is our contention that he is a trojan horse
helping to certify this class in order to destroy it .
so , mr. canning , is that true ?
are you a trojan horse ?
well , i definitely like being compared to anyone in homer .
but , no , sir .
for the last eight years , it &apos;s true ,
i have worked against people like lockhart &amp; gardner
and worked to demolish class actions like this one ,
and i was paid handsomely for it .
but six months ago i quit .
i sold my stock options and i went out on my own
because i saw the error of my ways .
i &apos;m here representing myself as an advocate for this class
precisely because i used to be on the other side .
well , uh , i can only certify one class ,
so the members of the losing class
will join the ranks of the winning
and the losing lawyers ... or lawyer
will be dismissed .
so , in four days time , i would like both law firms to return
and whichever has the most members in their class
will be certified .
that &apos;s , uh , that &apos;s all .
oh , and don &apos;t forget , if you &apos;re a blood owner ,
become a ...
blood donor .
where are we ?
we &apos;re up by six households .
our life is numbers these days .
okay , $ 55 million depends on getting signatures ,
so let &apos;s go .
we &apos;re broke .
we have cash on hand
for three staff members through the election .
yeah , that &apos;s the story of my life .
always recruited by the losing team .
yes , but we &apos;re the underdogs ; we &apos;re hard to dislike .
and why do i get the call ?
how have i shown myself deserving ?
we heard you quit eisner &amp; gowan , wendy &apos;s polling firm .
so we naturally assumed that you were unhappy .
we need a cheap pollster ,
and we thought you &apos;d like the chance to get back at them .
okay .
they were lying to her ,
telling her she had the youth vote sewn up .
and she doesn &apos;t ?
mm @-@ mmm .
are you saying that she &apos;s weak on the youth vote ?
no . you &apos;re strong .
see , i was doing a focus group during the last debate .
you were just bumping along in the low 20s .
and then you swore , and -- boom .
i mean , not with the 55 @-@ year @-@ olds ,
but the under 30s .
it was like watching a baby chick &apos;s eyes open .
you shot to low @-@ 70s and you stayed there .
kids thought it was honest .
but it &apos;s the youth vote .
yeah , yeah , and they never show up , right ?
except ...
yep .
the new ballot measure .
medical marijuana .
the youth vote is showing up to vote for amendment 31 .
we need to stop running away from prison .
see , wendy gets points because she &apos;s black ,
but she &apos;s like donna reed black .
you &apos;ve been to prison .
and that makes you hardcore .
matt , come work for us .
i don &apos;t know . i was liking daytime tv .
well , we &apos;re gonna put a nice big television in your office .
these are the houses canning signed up .
and the blue ones are ours .
so we are up seven households .
are they open to hearing about canning &apos;s background ?
well , i have an ambassador in the neighborhood -- rosanna .
she says that people like canning personally .
but they are open to hearing about collusion .
a class action takes a lot of money .
my guess is he &apos;s not bankrolling this himself .
i &apos;ll look for ties to jnl .
good . and you &apos;ll get back in the field .
quarterly partner meeting .
is something up ?
something &apos;s always up .
thank you all .
good to have everyone here and healthy .
and let &apos;s all applaud philip .
i heard twins .
good thing . that bought you a delay in the diocese depo .
now for the current state of our big @-@ ticket items ...
how is everything with the fallstrom pesticide dump ?
we &apos;re in process . lining up our class .
good . i heard there was a bump in certification .
judge abernathy .
he &apos;s being -- as is his wont -- cautious .
but we should know more by tuesday .
anything on your end , derrick ?
i guess now &apos;s as good a time as any .
i just got the go @-@ ahead to announce our newest client ,
americans for growth .
a new bipartisan super @-@ pac
with guaranteed financing of $ 120 million .
canning just leased a four @-@ story brownstone on the gold coast .
20 grand a month .
leased ?
so he &apos;s only here temporarily ?
i &apos;m checking .
i &apos;m also going to see if he cosigned his lease .
okay . good job .
sorry about that .
hi . are you the reporter that called ?
yeah . is he in ?
uh , no , but he &apos;s gonna be right back .
come in , though . come in . thanks .
he &apos;s been preparing all morning .
and you &apos;re his ... ?
wife . simone .
and you are ... ?
kalinda . hi .
um , he said to make yourself at home
and to answer any questions you had .
you can leave your coat right here .
and i have some hummus and pita downstairs i &apos;m going to get .
thank you .
yeah .
so tell me , how long have you two been married ?
i don &apos;t think i &apos;m gonna answer that one
because i &apos;ll be showing my age .
let &apos;s just say we were high school sweethearts .
so , is this more about work or home ?
both really .
okay , fire away .
&quot; is his condition hard on us ? &quot;
&quot; do i have to carry him down the stairs ? &quot;
i &apos;m sorry , i don &apos;t mean to ...
you &apos;re not prying at all .
it &apos;s totally fine . we &apos;re used to it .
no , no , no , guys .
can you just stay out of daddy &apos;s office ?
thank you . that &apos;s jay and bella .
they &apos;re not used to these chicago winters .
oh , can i get you a drink ?
actually , could i use your bathroom , please ?
sure , it &apos;s right there .
i &apos;ll be right back .
sure .
okay .
hello .
hi . i &apos;m kalinda .
so my wife says . louis .
are you getting what you need ?
well , sort of ,
but , i mean , anything you can help
with this profile . would be great .
oh , it &apos;s okay .
i know there &apos;s no article .
i &apos;ve been expecting you .
or someone like you .
someone from lockhart / gardner .
so , are you finding what you &apos;re looking for ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t know .
what , what should i be looking for ?
something to use against me .
you have , you have a nice brownstone .
yes , yes , i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m rich .
guilty .
gee , i think the concern is how you got rich .
oh , you mean from screwing the little man ?
more or less .
oh , no , woody guthrie &apos;s crying .
you , um , you don &apos;t seem too bothered
by my being here , do you ?
i &apos;m only bothered by things i don &apos;t expect .
can i ask you a question ?
do you think people can change ?
do i ?
no , i don &apos;t .
so , once a corporate lawyer , always a corporate lawyer ?
well , i think that six months is a very short time
to go from victimizer to victim .
saint paul did it in a second .
oh , so you &apos;re saint paul ?
no , i &apos;m just someone who thinks
lockhart / gardner is just this side of incompetent
and is gonna lose a lot of money
for some very nice , deserving people .
hey , hon ?
yeah ?
tell kalinda why i quit my job .
oh , i don &apos;t think she wants to hear any of that , hon .
sure , she &apos;s a reporter , of course she does .
course i do .
okay , um , well , uh , louis was amazing .
i miscarried ,
and that day he quit .
i &apos;m sorry , sorry to hear that .
he decided he wanted to stay home and help me .
i &apos;ll just let you guys talk .
nice to meet you .
you , too .
think that might be why i want
to help a class action of women who miscarried ?
i don &apos;t believe you . it &apos;s a trick .
it &apos;s kind of an elaborate trick having your wife miscarry .
no . it &apos;s either not true
or it &apos;s irrelevant .
he &apos;s in the pocket of the corporate interests , believe me .
i think he &apos;s getting in your head .
i think you &apos;re right . it &apos;s still a trick .
okay , i &apos;m gonna check into 27 equity .
i &apos;ll call you back later .
okay .
will ?
i hate being my mom .
oh , hi .
hi ! do you hate that , being your mom ?
i &apos;m not really my mom .
i didn &apos;t think i was either .
everything i did , i ran in the opposite direction .
have some pastrami .
that &apos;s okay .
my mom spent half her life
in tears , cooking dinner ,
waiting for my dad to return home .
and here i am .
and where is he ?
oh , um , i think ...
i warned him : there was a meeting .
fall for me and i &apos;m outta here .
now look at me .
go ahead , there &apos;s two .
come on .
so , what &apos;s the point ?
i don &apos;t want this .
what do you want ?
i ...
i don &apos;t know .
sometimes it &apos;s best just to remain friends .
that &apos;s what i found .
so this is a very serious issue
that doesn &apos;t get enough attention .
there is a measure that i would support
that takes medical marijuana seriously .
i &apos;ve seen firsthand the damage
our drug policies-- if you can call it that--
has done to our court system , our families , to lives .
$ 100 now , $ 200 later .
mm @-@ hmm . okay .
all you have to do is call me
when you see this car enter that garage .
okay , i &apos;ll give you a call .
thank you .
you lost two .
who ?
the two i was worried about , the hathaways and the wicks .
i was just heading over there .
how did he know to go to them ?
i don &apos;t know , but he went to them first thing .
he visited julie this morning , too .
please come in .
i know mr. canning visited ,
but before you make any decision ,
i just want to chat ...
that &apos;s okay .
i want to sign with you .
oh . i &apos;m sorry .
then that &apos;s great .
i just don &apos;t like how this back and forth
is hurting the neighborhood .
i know . it &apos;ll be over soon .
and i didn &apos;t like what he was saying about your firm .
he ... ?
what did he say ?
i finally found a use for this nanny @-@ cam .
i know her firm-- lockhart / gardner .
in normal economic times ,
they would be exactly the type of firm you &apos;d be looking for .
but right now they &apos;re undergoing a partnership battle
for control of the firm .
and the partners need this class action
in order to fight for that control .
i didn &apos;t know if it &apos;s true ,
but i thought i should bring it to you .
you didn &apos;t say anything ?
no .
then how ... ?
there &apos;s a mole .
i mean , listen , half the convicts i knew in prison
were there because of drugs ...
not too many hits .
it &apos;ll grow . peter &apos;s the first one even talking about it .
what does this do for our older constituents ?
it &apos;s a dog whistle . no one else hears it .
but , uh , here ,
i don &apos;t know what to do about this .
who &apos;s that man walking down the street ?
peter florrick !
who &apos;s that man you &apos;d like to meet ?
peter florrick !
that &apos;s right , that &apos;s right . he &apos;s here to fight !
what the hell ?
it gets worse .
peter is the man , peter is the right man peter has a plan ,
peter has the right plan
he &apos;s not black , he &apos;s not white .
he &apos;s got a plan to make it right .
who is it ?
neil howard sloan @-@ jacob .
he &apos;s a supporter .
our supporter .
you ask for civilian involvement ,
and this is what you get .
sing it loud , we &apos;re not just one , we &apos;re a crowd not just you ,
not just me , we &apos;re the peter family !
it &apos;s been zipping around the college blogs .
it has more hits than peter &apos;s speech .
he promises to make a new video every week .
god , it &apos;s like a hostage crisis .
peter has the right plan
eli , you know the worst thing to happen to any candidate ?
it &apos;s to be unhip .
ask hillary in &apos; 08 .
i &apos;ll contact him .
hey .
peter is the right man ! whoa !
i know who to talk to .
about this ? really , i &apos;m on it .
no , no , no , about helping us with the youth vote .
who ?
a guy i met in prison .
i don &apos;t get it .
how did he know about our partnership fight ?
it &apos;s not just that .
canning &apos;s been one step ahead of us all week .
yes , but only you and i knew this .
rosanna .
rosanna was here earlier
when you went upstairs for your partner meeting .
you think she overheard us and then
slipped it to canning ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;ll see if she flipped .
anything on who &apos;s financing canning ?
it &apos;s not jnl pesticides .
it &apos;s this-- 27 equity ,
a new york hedge fund .
oh , my god , it &apos;s the newest thing in litigation .
they did the same thing last year
with the ground zero workers .
the lawyers borrowed $ 35 million
to finance the lawsuit .
the interest was astronomical .
15 % a year .
so if he isn &apos;t in the pocket of jnl , the why &apos;s he doing this ?
i think there &apos;s a chance he &apos;s sincere .
doesn &apos;t matter .
we still need to beat him in court .
how did you communicate with rosanna ?
on the phone , through e @-@ mails .
let me check your computer .
yeah .
your car just showed up .
it &apos;s not much of a cushion being up by two people .
it &apos;s all we need .
all rise .
thank you all for returning promptly .
court is now in session .
and where are we on the class overlap ? mr. canning ?
i think some of the fallstrom neighbors
haven &apos;t decided yet , sir .
yes , your honor , but of the neighbors who have ,
we have a majority : 41 to 39 .
no , no , actually , i believe were tied at 40 .
at least when i count my letters of consent .
is that true , ms. lockhart ?
mr. gardner ?
i think the dust is still settling , your honor .
but what is true is a matter that came to our attention :
just today mr. canning colluded with jnl pesticides
at their company headquarters .
really ? colluded ?
mr. canning ?
it &apos;s true , your honor ,
i visited jnl at their invitation
to see what kind of deal could be made .
i must admit i was too busy bargaining with jnl
to follow opposing counsel .
but i did manage to come away with an offer of $ 2 million .
your honor , this suit is worth 20 times that amount .
i @-@ i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s true ,
but i do know that $ 2 million is considerably more
than what &apos;s currently on the table : zero .
mr. canning , it was not within your purview
to negotiate on behalf of the class action .
and i didn &apos;t reach out to jnl . they reached out to me .
because this is a sweetheart deal .
even if what ms. lockhart is saying is true ,
isn &apos;t it better that a trojan horse like myself
get whatever deal can be made now
instead of waiting the five or six years ...
objection , your honor .
... for the $ 50 million they &apos;re hoping for ?
lockhart / gardner &apos;s position is to fight .
and they make enemies of their opponents .
i make them my friends .
because you intend to lower the deal !
i intend to get a deal ! a fight takes time .
ask your clients if they &apos;re willing to risk that time .
why don &apos;t we make a deal now ?
all right !
i &apos;m glad to see you &apos;ve all given blood .
let &apos;s not spill any more here .
it is within my purview to marry these two classes ,
and that is what i intend to do .
but , your honor ...
no , no , no .
no .
mr. canning , ms. lockhart , mr. gardner ,
look across the aisle to each other .
look .
by the powers vested in me by the state of illinois ,
i now pronounce you one class .
congratulations .
get a good deal .
i don &apos;t care if he says we &apos;re married .
we are in charge .
okay . well , we &apos;ll make the best deal we can . okay ?
you going for a quick run ?
maybe not so quick .
look . i &apos;m sorry about dinner .
we &apos;ve just got this thing and ...
hold on .
hey , kalinda . what &apos;s up ?
it &apos;s not a leak .
what @-@ what do you mean ? what is it ?
why canning is ahead of us .
he put spector pro on alicia &apos;s laptop .
that &apos;s keylogger software .
what ?
every key alicia hit
was sent through a wi @-@ fi parasite program
to another computer .
that &apos;s how canning knew .
can we prove it ?
well , we can trace it back ,
but he &apos;ll know we &apos;re tracing .
you want to use it ?
alicia , send an e @-@ mail to diane
saying our geographical report
places the target amount at $ 70 million .
okay .
you want to chase up the offer ?
then have diane write back saying we &apos;re willing
to take it to 85 million .
if canning &apos;s in bed with jnl ,
they &apos;ll be terrified .
okay . will do .
okay , call me when you &apos;re done .
okay . i &apos;ll go for a jog with you .
i have a date tomorrow night .
you ... you what ?
i have a date with a south african soccer player tomorrow night .
you do not .
i do . picking me up at 8 : 00 .
think he &apos;s gonna come in one of those cute little soccer uniforms ?
i don &apos;t care how he comes .
i don &apos;t understand .
are you breaking up with me ?
no . just putting things on pause .
i &apos;m not falling in love with you .
i know .
i just need a little cooling @-@ off period . 30 days .
that &apos;s all .
no . you told me not to fall in love with you ,
and i didn &apos;t .
i know .
30 days . i &apos;ll call you at the end of february .
you okay ?
am i ... ?
yeah . why ?
well , i just asked you what you thought
a good compromise come @-@ out offer was ,
and you said , &quot; yes . &quot;
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m distracted .
i ...
life is complicated , isn &apos;t it ?
it can be .
i don &apos;t know what i want .
i &apos;m very good when i know what i want ,
but when i don &apos;t ,
i suck .
is this work ?
it &apos;s ...
nothing .
i need friends .
i need , like , a fat buddy
who i can tell things to and get drunk .
i &apos;ll work on that .
will ? do you have a minute ?
it &apos;ll just be a minute .
i think we need to talk to diane
about backing away from litigation .
why ?
i think she &apos;s letting her leftist activism
get the best of her .
a year ago that might have been true , but not now .
take over the pesticide case .
why ? it &apos;s not mine to take over .
she &apos;s pushing for an $ 85 million deal .
she &apos;ll never win .
how do you know that ?
how do i know she won &apos;t win ?
how do you know she &apos;s looking for $ 85 million ?
i know .
you can &apos;t tell me how ?
trust me .
my information is solid .
alicia wanted her to come in at $ 70 million .
diane pushed it to 85 .
okay , i &apos;ll talk to diane .
good . thanks .
get out of here !
i will not get out of here .
peter asked me personally to ask you ...
personally .
no ! no ! no ! no ! that does not happen !
that does happen .
and it &apos;s happening to you .
i didn &apos;t think anyone even saw that old video .
but i knew i had to do something .
well , it was very entertaining .
well , that was the whole point , you know ?
i mean , people think that politics can be so dry ,
but i think it can be fun .
so what is this position ?
oh , well ...
it &apos;s the liaison to the political director--
me .
and i can send you anything ?
song ideas ?
commercials ?
or ways to make the glee songs for peter ?
yes .
we &apos;ve been trying to get the public involved ,
get them to coordinate with our message .
so yes , send everything to me .
and you don &apos;t think it &apos;s better if i just do it on my own ?
no . it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s better if it comes through my office .
and i &apos;m sorry we can &apos;t offer you
a stipend at this time ,
but if things work out ...
no , no , i want to keep my day job .
this is just so great , mr. gold .
please tell peter that i think he &apos;s amazing .
by the way ...
why did you do this for peter ?
why ?
he spoke at the school about bullying .
about making fun of kids .
he said people see someone who &apos;s different than them ,
and they never get a chance to really know them .
and the only way to make life rich is ,
next time , have lunch with them .
well , he said it better than me , but
the week after that , i could just feel
that the mood here ... was different .
i never thought words made much difference .
just music .
but he changed people .
not for that long , just a few days .
and music can &apos;t do that .
so that &apos;s what makes this so great
is that i will be working for him .
it will be great .
nice meeting you , mr. sloan @-@ jacob .
yes , mr. gold .
i only covered the 27th floor desktops .
28th floor was off @-@ limits .
i found keylogging software on alicia &apos;s desktop ,
julius cain &apos;s , and neka &apos;s in litigation .
now , given that wide of a distribution ,
it &apos;s more likely to be bond spying than canning .
two equity partners and one
junior associate . why alicia ?
her close connection to me ?
that would be my guess .
he wouldn &apos;t want to put keylogging software on your computer ,
but he wanted to keep track of what you wrote to alicia .
what did you tell her ?
alicia ?
about this ? nothing .
thank you , kalinda . i think we need a moment .
no . i think kalinda should stay .
she can help us .
i think we should do the same thing
we were planning to do with canning .
use it ?
yes .
diane , you write to julius
about getting to bond &apos;s weakest votes .
get him to fire his own people ?
yes . we need the majority
of equity partners to vote bond out .
we can &apos;t pick off his votes .
but he can .
i think i &apos;m liking this .
it &apos;s gonna be hard to go back to the law .
so you just got out of prison ?
yeah . november .
eight months .
heard that you got caught up for a while ?
home monitoring . it &apos;s not so bad .
yeah , i &apos;ve been there .
how &apos;s your mom ?
oh , she &apos;s hanging in there . yours ?
she hates my last album .
so , uh , do you miss anything about it ?
what ? being inside ?
god , no .
you are funny .
foolish question .
so , um , i guess i owe you one , huh ?
no . no , hey , the legal advice was free .
but it was damn good advice .
better than anything i &apos;ve gotten on the outside since .
i &apos;m glad .
so , what do you need ?
i need the youth vote .
i &apos;m sorry .
hey , i told you , brother-- that tatt--
nice black panther right there-- you &apos;ll get my vote .
well , i was thinking maybe just an interview .
you and me .
an interview ?
yeah . oh , that all ?
i mean , i thought we were talking about a fund @-@ raiser .
uh , sorry . i was just passing by .
um , what @-@ what kind of fund @-@ raiser ?
just so we &apos;re clear .
we didn &apos;t consider the offer made to your co @-@ counsel , mr. canning ,
to be a lowball offer .
we consider it to be our offer , our best , last and final .
well , how nice for you .
then we &apos;ll see you in court .
good . okay , wait .
wait . look , we &apos;re not trying to pick your pockets .
we just need to show the judge a hint of movement .
no , we don &apos;t .
yes , actually , yes , we do .
mr. canning , can we talk to you a minute ?
good job . nicely played .
oh , don &apos;t even pretend .
what ? we &apos;re good cop , bad copping them .
no , we &apos;re not .
you &apos;re undercutting us .
we &apos;ll contest any lowball offer .
it &apos;s a lucky world where $ 2 million
is a lowball offer .
don &apos;t worry . we &apos;re doing great .
don &apos;t you just look at them and feel something ?
excuse me ?
those mothers .
they miscarried .
they can &apos;t have children .
don &apos;t you feel something when you hear them ,
or is your cynicism that deep ?
mrs. florrick ,
you don &apos;t know me .
you don &apos;t know what my life is .
i may have the greatest compassion for them in the world ,
or i may have none .
it &apos;s irrelevant .
what i owe them is not my compassion .
it &apos;s my ability .
and that &apos;s what i &apos;m giving them .
canning got rosanna to flip to his side
by showing her a document from jnl pesticides .
what kind of a document ?
an internal analysis of what they were willing to pay .
does she have a copy ?
no . he just showed it to her .
then it doesn &apos;t matter .
he &apos;ll claim it &apos;s privileged , part of negotiations .
no . he can &apos;t .
sure , he ...
we got to get to judge abernathy .
okay , okay .
please don &apos;t put me in the position of refereeing everyone .
we had our settlement offer accepted .
$ 2.4 million ,
with one million in reserve for future claims .
that offer was made to mr. canning , and not ...
okay . you don &apos;t have a deal , mr. foxson , until the court
certifies a deal .
now , who is this witness ?
mr. carl hobart , your honor .
and what will he testify to ?
an exhibit we would like to place into evidence .
okay . so , proceed .
mr. hobart , what is your job ?
my job ? i am a claims analyst with 27 equity .
and that is a hedge fund ?
yes . and you were recently sent a document by mr. louis canning ?
objection , your honor . relevance .
uh , uh , uh , uh , mr. canning ,
you can &apos;t object to your own co @-@ counsel .
objection , your honor .
relevance .
i think
i &apos;ll overrule that on absurdity alone .
you may answer .
yes , i was sent a document for review .
as collateral for mr. canning &apos;s loan ?
yes .
uh , we loaned mr. canning $ 4 million for this lawsuit ,
so we needed to see all relevant documents .
and this document under discussion
was prepared by jnl pesticides
stating how much they were willing ...
objection ! objection !
your honor , this document was part of evidence ,
and is , therefore , privileged .
it , therefore , cannot be used in court .
that would be true , your honor ,
except that mr. canning pierced his own privilege
by showing this document to a hedge fund .
now , he can &apos;t have it both ways .
either it &apos;s privileged , or it &apos;s not .
and now ... it &apos;s not .
your honor ?
that seems a particularly good point ,
mr. canning . you can &apos;t pick
and choose when privilege applies .
do you have anything else ?
no , your honor .
okay , i &apos;ll admit it . nicely played .
thank you .
you still have to make a deal .
my guess is it &apos;ll be easier now .
so , that was all cynical , right ?
you were just trying to lower the amount of the award ?
i think people were harmed here ,
and i think companies ought to pay for their mistakes .
but i think companies are paying too much for their mistakes ,
and i think lawyers are helping people
distort the amount of harm .
that &apos;s all .
so , if that &apos;s cynical , then ...
i &apos;m a cynic .
the bells ring no , no , no , no , no , no , no

hmm . i love it .
the bells ring no , no , no , no
how was your south african soccer player ?
fictional .
i don &apos;t know what this is . i ...
i don &apos;t like needing ... anyone .
i know .
it &apos;s not commitment .
it &apos;s just preferential treatment .
i can deal with that .
mmm ! you smell like you .
you smell like will .
i thought i could do without it .
but you have to be more gentle with me .
i &apos;m not as tough as i look .
okay .
the bells ring no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no
