daniel didn &apos;t die trying to kill emily .
he saved her .
i have to start at the beginning
with a damaged little girl named amanda clarke ,
also known as emily thorne .
xanax . calms my nerves .
those pills you &apos;re taking -- it &apos;s compounded with larium .
your family &apos;s been drugging you .
as long as i &apos;m incapacitated ,
mother controls the inheritance .
as long as malcolm black is out there ,
our lives are in danger .
i &apos;m dealing with him .
threatening him with evidence
is a temporary solution at best , david .
go to the fbi and ask for protection .
they can &apos;t help us . look , i know how to stop him .
this has to end .
i want you to know , in case anything happens to me ,
there &apos;s a flash drive --
evidence that i &apos;ve accumulated of all his criminal activity .
i @-@ i turned in the flash drive , anonymously .
there was enough evidence on there
to put him away for the rest of his life .
if you only knew how wrong you are .
i heard a s.w.a.t. team
arrested a guy named malcolm black earlier .
they turned him over to the feds .
but then i heard he was released .
i came for your father .
look what i found .
night @-@ night .
what did you do ?
i didn &apos;t do anything .
then where are we ?
looks like some kind of refuse depot by the water .
the last thing i remember
is malcolm black at the lighthouse .
that &apos;s impossible . malcolm is dead .
what game are you playing , emily ?
it &apos;s not a game , victoria .
and as you can see , i &apos;m very much alive .
and so it seems , are you , amanda clarke .
must have been really tough ,
keeping your identity a secret for so long .
well , your secret &apos;s out .
what do you want with us ?
if it &apos;s money , we &apos;ll pay it .
i don &apos;t need your money .
but i need your help .
we have to send david clarke ...
a wee message .
david .
i &apos;m sorry to burst in here like this but --
what are you doing ?
malcolm won &apos;t be in jail for long .
it &apos;s best if amanda and i disappear while we still have the time .
the feds already released him .
i told you so .
he has other agents on his payroll .
what about my flash drive ?
it &apos;s also gone .
when ?
i didn &apos;t call in case they had your phone tapped .
i warned you about this , but you wouldn &apos;t listen .
malcolm black will be out for blood .
thinks i double @-@ crossed him .
i did what i thought was right .
yeah , and look where that got us .
we have to act fast . i &apos;m gonna go get amanda .
should have never , shouldn &apos;t have kept her in the dark about this .
she &apos;s trained for it .
she can be an asset .
i &apos;ll look for malcolm .
when you talked to him ,
did you get any sense of where he might be ,
anything that could lead me to him ?
no , he &apos;s too smart for that ,
but you were right not to call my cellphone .
he &apos;s already tracking my every move .
he -- he &apos;s not far .
he thinks kate &apos;s still alive , so
he won &apos;t leave here without her .
meet back at grayson manor .
watch your back .
i &apos;m starting to think
you don &apos;t know the meaning of &quot; personal days . &quot;
i need to talk to you now .
well , take it easy .
what &apos;s your problem , porter ?
i need you to help me find someone --
no questions asked .
all right , i &apos;ll bite .
malcolm black .
the guy we just turned over to the feds ?
the guy the feds just released .
there &apos;s a lot more you don &apos;t know .
like he wants david clarke dead ?
how did you ...
the david clarke who wasn &apos;t really imprisoned
for the last 10 years ?
the father of amanda clarke ,
who , as it turns out , is emily thorne ?
i know the whole story , porter .
ben , you can &apos;t tell anyone .
there are lives at stake here .
well , i haven &apos;t decided what i &apos;m gonna do yet ,
and as for needing help ,
i don &apos;t think i &apos;m gonna put my life on the line
for a bunch of people who &apos;ve been lying to me .
all right , look , you have every right to be pissed ,
but there &apos;s more .
i think that alvarez &apos;s disappearance
is tied to malcolm , too .
so , you think he &apos;s dead .
i don &apos;t know , but if there &apos;s a chance he &apos;s not ...
alvarez saved my ass years ago .
i owe him .
malcolm had double agents working with the feds .
he might even have people
right here in our own department .
please , man , i need your help .
emily ?
emily !
emily ?
didn &apos;t expect to hear from me again so soon , now ,
did you , clarke ?
i told you .
you &apos;re out of your league .
so , now we do things my way .
i want my daughter back ,
alive and unharmed .
i &apos;ll give you until noon tomorrow
because i want these ladies here
to enjoy
what might be their last night on earth .
bring my daughter .
第四季第十三集
i got your message .
no leads on malcolm ,
but i got here as soon as i could .
it &apos;s okay .
he knows the truth about everything ...
including emily .
seems to me you can use all the help you can get .
he kidnapped them .
he &apos;s holding them in exchange
for the safe return of his daughter .
we have till noon .
yeah , if we could give him proof
that kate was still alive , then ...
you know , maybe we can buy ourselves some time
to look for them .
how exactly do you plan to do that
for someone who died several days ago ?
by re @-@ editing kate &apos;s voice memos from her phone .
there &apos;s not enough to go on there to fool malcolm .
just bits and pieces -- it doesn &apos;t add up to anything .
what about your buddy nolan ross ?
isn &apos;t he some kind of computer genius ?
i can &apos;t put anybody else &apos;s life at risk .
so that &apos;s it ?
there &apos;s no other options ?
there might be . that &apos;s why i called you down here .
i was hoping that this isn &apos;t the only phone
that i can pull her voice from .
因袭击前女友被射杀身亡
i was so blind .
emily went to extreme measures to ensure we all were .
what are we going to do about it ?
margaux , there &apos;s nothing to do .
my father &apos;s death , your son &apos;s ...
emily was behind all of it .
she &apos;s a criminal .
why would you not want to punish her ?
20 years ago ,
when daniel &apos;s life was threatened ,
i chose to save him , and in so doing ,
i hurt her father .
i feel i owe it to david .
please , margaux .
keep this between us .
it &apos;s margaux lemarchal .
meet me tonight .
i need your services .
why don &apos;t you save your energy ?
there &apos;s no way of getting out of there .
but i do love watching you try .
cheeky monkeys .
by my estimate , malcolm or one of his men
come back to check on us every 30 minutes ,
we &apos;re gonna have to work fast ,
maybe move one of these boxes
to ram the gate before he comes back .
do you hear me ?
we need to move fast .
we don &apos;t have to do anything .
i &apos;m loath to follow any plan you &apos;ve concocted , emily .
what the hell is wrong with you ?
well , you &apos;ve given me little reason to help you ,
let alone live .
it &apos;s not about us .
it &apos;s about everyone else who &apos;s gonna suffer
if we don &apos;t get out of here alive ,
including my father .
your words hold no meaning for me anymore .
it &apos;s funny , isn &apos;t it ?
who would have thought
that after all was said and done ,
you and i would die together ?
keeping up with your brother &apos;s campaign , i see .
oh , no .
oh , easy , darling .
it &apos;s not even noon ,
and already you &apos;re trying to dull your senses .
you &apos;re not really here .
well , of course i am , lou @-@ lou .
aren &apos;t you glad to see your mama ?
you must be nolan ross .
i have heard so much about you .
penelope ellis .
mama ellis ... in the flesh .
you must have come to refill
your daughter &apos;s prescriptions , no doubt ?
pardon ?
don &apos;t mind me .
louise , dear , give your mama a hug .
oh , i have been worried sick about you .
lyman says you are not doing well .
as you can see , i &apos;m doing perfectly fine .
well , with him back out on the campaign trail ,
i thought maybe you and i could spend some time together .
actually louise and i had plans .
a deep tissue massage and seaweed facial awaits .
well , fine .
i should probably get back to the house
and settle in first .
the house ?
oh , you mean you &apos;re not just staying at a hotel for the night ?
i have decided to rent a place in the hamptons for the summer .
that way you and i can be close to each other all the time ,
the way a real family should be .
one big , happy , indeed .
clarke .
well , you were always a little slow
when presented with a task , weren &apos;t you ?
i needed time to get to kate ,
but i &apos;m here now and looking at her .
yeah , it &apos;s me .
i &apos;m here .
katie ? katie , darling ?
you can hear her . she &apos;s alive and well .
so cooperate , or that &apos;s gonna change in a hurry .
no , you listen to me .
this is not a negotiation .
i want my daughter back now .
it &apos;s over .
i &apos;m sorry .
jack .
clarke , you are really ...
really trying my patience .
now , let me speak to my daughter .
cedar hill . sundown .
you bring victoria and amanda , and i &apos;ll bring kate .
i &apos;m telling you , we should bring in the s.w.a.t. team .
they know how to handle hostage situations .
malcolm already infiltrated law enforcement .
kate was proof of that , as are the feds that let him go .
yeah , but one of those hostages could be alvarez .
he would know how to work it from the inside .
you have to trust me .
because you have such a great track record
when it comes to trust ?
hey , i didn &apos;t ask for your help .
guys , enough !
we only have a few hours till sundown .
you &apos;re wasting what little time we have .
that exchange with malcolm
is gonna have to be our last resort .
finding the women ... it &apos;s gonna be nearly impossible .
we could check at the station ...
see if emily &apos;s car popped up on the abandoned @-@ vehicle log .
it &apos;s a good place to start .
we &apos;ll find them , david .
i hope you &apos;re right .
mother .
oh , you &apos;re not leaving , are you ?
i was hoping we could get a late lunch .
i &apos;m afraid i &apos;m busy . i &apos;m running behind ...
oh , this is just a lovely hotel .
and you certainly are settling in nicely around here .
i &apos;m so glad to see you happy , louise .
you can drop the act now , mother .
we &apos;re alone .
what do you want ?
lyman said you gave him a lot of trouble .
that wasn &apos;t very nice .
well , neither was drugging me for most of my life ,
but that didn &apos;t seem to stop the two of you .
you are not well , louise .
you haven &apos;t been ever since your daddy died .
you need those pills to stay sane .
those pills you tricked me
into taking had horrible side effects ,
which included seeing a lot more of you than i wanted to .
yes , lyman told me about that .
you see , those are exactly the kind of ravings
that led judge miller
to appoint me your legal conservator .
first , you start off with that nasty article ,
now these wild claims about drugging you .
i can see i got here just in time .
my lyman has potential .
i &apos;m gonna be the mother of a congressman ,
and i will not let you ruin that .
he always did come first , didn &apos;t he ?
he always let you spend whatever you wanted
as long as you behaved .
now , you will keep quiet , or the money stops .
you can &apos;t cut me off .
but i can .
judge said so .
don &apos;t fight me on this , louise .
you &apos;ll come out on the losing end ,
like always .
that &apos;s emily &apos;s car .
you think this is where he kidnapped her ?
i don &apos;t know .
what the hell was she doing out here ?
i don &apos;t know .
i thought you knew everything about her .
look , i was in the dark for a while too .
when did you find out the truth ?
about a year and a half ago .
whoa , what , wait ... how did that feel ?
knowing she was lying to you about who she was ?
it took me a while to make my peace with it ,
but i did .
and i kept her secret because --
because revealing it would have hurt her .
she &apos;s on the right side of this war ,
whether you know it or not .
there &apos;s no sign of struggle .
we do have a security cam , which means we can see
what kind of car malcolm was driving ,
maybe which way they headed .
the parks department is near my house .
get the security footage . meet me there at my place .
wait -- where are you going ?
to tell david there might be another way !
ladies ... i brought you some food .
thought you might need to keep your strength up .
i &apos;d hate for david to think i was mistreating you .
what &apos;s the point ?
you &apos;re gonna kill us anyway , aren &apos;t you ?
why wait for david
when there &apos;s someone else who knows where she is ?
i &apos;m listening .
you &apos;re a businessman .
surely you know that valuable information has a cost .
what do you want ?
my freedom , of course .
you don &apos;t cage a majestic peacock
with a howler monkey .
i &apos;ll give you your freedom ,
if your information has proven valuable .
victoria , don &apos;t say another word .
perhaps you &apos;ve heard of a man named jack porter ?
yeah .
you can be certain that david made jack aware of his plan ,
so i would go find him if i were you .
he might prove very helpful
as to your daughter &apos;s whereabouts .
this is just a desperate attempt to save herself
with information that she doesn &apos;t have .
ivan .
don &apos;t you dare .
go see our friend mr. porter again .
find out what he knows .
no !
enough .
you , tie them up .
they just won &apos;t respect what little freedom i give them .
you , get on your way .
and whatever answers you get from porter ,
after that , feel free to kill him .
we found emily &apos;s car near the lighthouse .
ben &apos;s checking the security footage
to see what malcolm was driving .
we can put out an apb on his car .
it &apos;s too late , jack .
what are you talking about ?
there &apos;s still time .
it &apos;s almost sundown .
okay .
then how are we doing this ?
no , it &apos;s my problem , not yours .
you can &apos;t do this alone .
no , i &apos;m the one to blame .
i put my friends and family in harm &apos;s way ,
especially amanda .
as soon as i found out who she was ,
i should have taken her away from all this .
now i might lose her
without even spending a day with her .
i &apos;ve seen her through a lot in these last few years ,
and if there &apos;s one thing i know
it &apos;s that she can take care of herself .
she &apos;ll find a way to survive , david .
she always has .
in a few hours , this will all be over ...
one way or the other .
well , i &apos;m not giving up .
you know ,
when you walked up to me at the lighthouse ,
i thought you were going to kill me .
now i wished you had .
you and i both know
that we &apos;re only in this situation
because of the photo that you sent
that led kate straight to me .
you were already onto kate ,
and we were both just trying to help david .
it all comes back to my father , doesn &apos;t it ?
are you driven by the guilt you have
for what you did to him ?
love is complicated .
he doesn &apos;t love you .
how do you think i knew to send you to the lighthouse ?
my father said that it would be the perfect place
to stage a grieving mother &apos;s suicide .
from the moment my father returned to the hamptons ,
he &apos;s been plotting your death .
ladies .
nice to see you two finally settling in ,
but i &apos;m afraid it &apos;s time to take a little field trip .
so , let me get this straight ... you breathe a word to anyone
about the dosing and she cuts you off ?
sounds about right .
your father left you that money .
you &apos;re off the pills , ergo , no longer cray @-@ cray .
you can make decisions for yourself .
yeah , try telling that to any judge in savannah .
my mom &apos;s got a team of lawyers
that has every one of them paid off ,
which means the conservatorship sticks
and she keeps control of my money .
how did you put up with her all those years ?
easy .
i had my daddy .
i remember this one time ,
she tried to banish me to boarding school ,
but when we got there ,
my father was waiting on the steps .
he put me back in the car and told her
she could find her own way home .
it sounds like he was the only one
who was able to go a few rounds with mommy dearest .
yeah , he just couldn &apos;t win the fight with himself .
he knew his drinking would get the best of him ,
which is i think he left me the money .
he wanted me to be safe from her .
and yet , that is exactly the thing
that &apos;s putting you in danger right now .
i &apos;m scared , nolan .
without my bank account , i just ...
i don &apos;t know how to live .
mama deserves to suffer for what she did ,
but i don &apos;t think i can make it on my own .
and you can &apos;t give up .
your daddy wanted you to have that money , not her .
there &apos;s got to be another way .
we just ...
we haven &apos;t figured it out yet .
you find anything on the tapes ?
ben ?
what the hell ?
been a long time , clarke .
yeah , not long enough .
where &apos;s my daughter ?
where &apos;s amanda ?
what , you think i &apos;ll bring both of them
untill i know that my daughter is safe ?
kate &apos;s in the van , but i expect to see amanda ...
shut up .
don &apos;t bother .
how stupid do you think i am ?
she was never alive ,
and you &apos;re gonna suffer the same fate .
no !
go ahead . get it over with .
you know what ?
that would be too easy , my friend .
i &apos;m gonna need to see you suffer first .
this guy got the jump on me
while i was watching he security footage .
he thought i was you ,
wanted to know where kate was being held .
how did malcolm figure out i was involved ?
hell if i know .
what did you find on the tapes ?
nothing .
emily &apos;s car was the last to pull into the lot .
nobody came in or left after her .
it doesn &apos;t make any sense .
even when this guy wakes up ,
he &apos;s never give up malcolm &apos;s location .
wait , wait , wait .
this ... this ... it &apos;s a message from emily .
a star ?
no , when we were kids ,
we ... we would play treasure hunt ,
and w @-@ we &apos;d draw a map ,
and we &apos;d put a star with a circle on it ...
that &apos;s where the treasure was buried .
i know it sounds crazy .
what ?
okay , but , i mean , without a map ,
you don &apos;t really have much to go on .
we got to be missing something .
i &apos;m not sure it matters .
it &apos;s dark now . we never heard back from david .
maybe we &apos;re too late .
this guy &apos;s been walking through coal .
she used this to draw that .
no other cars pulled into the lot last night
because she wasn &apos;t taken by car .
she was taken by boat
to the one place that still uses coal for their incinerator .
the trash yard down on the water .
what happened ?
it &apos;s over .
sit down .
let them go .
all the time we &apos;ve been together ,
you should know me better than that .
i &apos;m gonna kill you .
that &apos;s for damn sure .
but i thought it &apos;d be be more fun for you
to watch them die first .
they got nothing to do with it . it &apos;s me you want .
you know what ?
you &apos;re right .
but just for old time &apos;s sake ,
why don &apos;t you do the work while i watch ?
i know in the past you were of great help to my father
when he needed things taken care of .
pascal was very good to me .
may he rest in peace .
and that appreciation will continue .
there &apos;s a woman who needs to pay for crossing me .
you want me to pin something on her ?
that won &apos;t be necessary .
she &apos;s already committed the crimes .
then why not turn her over to the police ?
i &apos;m missing one crucial detail --
evidence .
that &apos;s where you come in .
i &apos;ll start by tapping her phone .
all i need &apos;s a name and a number .
i get quick results .
quick results are exactly what i &apos;m looking for .
i &apos;m waiting , clarke .
i said ...
i &apos;m waiting , clarke !
leave him alone !
go to hell !
go to hell ?
great idea !
how &apos;s that for hell ? !
you had to make it complicated .
one slit across the throat ,
and it &apos;d have been a quick death for both of them .
so , now we do it my way ...
in pieces .
it &apos;s easier to burn the evidence .
no , wait .
wait .
stay away from her !
this is for killing my daughter .
i did it !
i killed kate .
she murdered my son ,
and i shot that bitch in cold blood .
you ?
you !
you know the best part ?
i loved it .
go ahead .
stab me like a coward .
like a coward ?
let her go !
not another move .
we &apos;re gonna get you out of here .
no .
emily !
wait .
no !
drawing our treasure @-@ hunt sign on malcolm &apos;s gunman
was a smart move .
after i convinced victoria to create a distraction .
i guess her guilt is finally catching up with her .
she knew she had to help .
i &apos;m glad she did .
it made all the difference .
you &apos;re still here .
i was out of options .
but i knew that you and my father
were working together
and that you &apos;d be all right .
well , we had a little help from ben , too .
they found alvarez &apos;s personal effects
at the warehouse .
he &apos;s taking it pretty hard .
what are you gonna tell the detectives ?
i &apos;ll start with the truth ...
that malcolm was released by double agents within the fbi
and we didn &apos;t know who we could trust .
i &apos;m not sure
it &apos;ll be that easy to explain all of this to ben .
it &apos;ll be easier than you think .
david .
i can &apos;t believe you did that ...
taking the blame for killing kate
and saving amanda .
i don &apos;t know what to say .
emily and i united in a plan
that we hoped would lead jack to find us .
i thought i &apos;d sacrifice myself to buy you both more time .
it worked .
i now know that you were trying to kill me ,
before i confessed my sins to you and even after .
victoria ...
you know , i could call the police
and reveal your sins to them , but i won &apos;t .
you and emily deserve a life together .
i need to mourn my son .
it &apos;s what we all deserve .
we need to go our separate ways , david .
goodbye .
i got your message . what are we celebrating ?
the end of your control over louise .
my legal team found a loophole in your conservatorship .
seems you only remain in charge of your daughter ...
until she finds a husband .
guess who just got married .
you did what ?
and that makes me her conservator now ,
which means louise is finally free of you .
penny for your thoughts ?
i think congratulations are in order .
i think i will grab us a bottle of our best dom to celebrate .
do you really think you &apos;ve won ?
the law is the law , mother .
it was a clever attempt , dear , but this is not over ,
and you will give me control back ,
or the real truth will come out .
what are you talking about ?
those pills only helped your feeble , little mind
to forget what you really did .
you killed your father .
and once i tell that new husband of yours
and the rest of the world ,
you will truly be left with nothing .
just like you deserve .
dad , why aren &apos;t you at the hospital ?
i was getting treated
when i heard him arguing with the doctors .
they wanted him to stay the night ,
but he wasn &apos;t having it .
he &apos;s stubborn .
yeah , well , runs in the family .
yeah , i &apos;m starting to see that .
well , i told the docs i &apos;d get him home safe .
thank you . we owe you a lot .
well , i &apos;ll take it from here .
well , good night .
ben , wait .
i don &apos;t know what we did to deserve your help , but ..
i &apos;m just glad you &apos;re both okay .
why are you helping us ?
i spoke to jack .
i know that you know .
i &apos;m sorry .
i was relieved , actually .
all this time , i thought the reason
you were always acting so weird around me
was because of me .
not true .
and as to why i &apos;m helping ...
when i was a rookie , i worked undercover .
and i had to assume another identity for months
to help take down a drug ring .
so you think you know what i went through ?
no .
no , no , that &apos;s not what i &apos;m saying at all ,
but ... but i do understand how hard it is
to break people &apos;s trust in order to protect them .
not being able to be yourself , having to push people away .
it gets to you after a while .
it &apos;s lonely .
so , while i don &apos;t know exactly what you &apos;ve been through ,
i know it must &apos;ve been for the right reasons
if you were willing to sacrifice so much .
thank you for saying that .
and you don &apos;t have to worry about this going any further .
so what do you say , beginning tomorrow ,
we ... we start over ?
i &apos;d say i &apos;d like that very much .
good night .
good night .
victoria .
how awful .
and to know david has been betraying you all along .
well , a part of me sensed that his feelings
weren &apos;t genuine for some time .
i &apos;m just glad i know for certain .
which means your loyalty to him is no longer warranted .
emily deserves to pay for what she &apos;s done .
she may not have put the bullet in daniel ,
but she &apos;s the reason so much misery
has come into our lives .
an expose splashed across
my media outlets around the world
could lead to a lengthy prison sentence .
emily &apos;s not worth your time .
besides , revenge is a dangerous game .
and the only thing that &apos;s important to me now
is you and my grandchild .
and you &apos;re important to me , as well .
but honoring daniel &apos;s memory is something
i have to do .
very well .
but heed my warning ...
emily hasn &apos;t left a trail of evidence .
do not do anything until you have irrefutable proof .
not to worry .
i have a way to get the evidence i need .
it will be me who destroys her .
