hey , who &apos;s there ?
go .
when are things gonna stop being weird between us ?
i &apos;m straight . i was married .
i cheated on my boyfriend , and i lost my virginity
to a random boy i barely know .
i &apos;m pretty sure that makes me a slut .
hi , it &apos;s a.j. i got arrested .
for huffing .
tagging .
what is it ?
it &apos;s a bat signal .
i just wanted ty to know where i was .
ty ?
that &apos;s my brother .
just something about him . he &apos;s a good kid .
are you thinking about fostering him ?
i was thinking about you fostering him .
so , callie , we were thinking
that maybe a.j. could hang out with you during the day--
you know , go to class and the drop @-@ in center .
and then , a.j. , once we get your transcripts ,
we can see what credits you still need ,
and then we can get you enrolled in summer school .
sound good ?
yes , ma &apos;am .
and you don &apos;t have to call me ma &apos;am . lena &apos;s fine .
yeah , and i can pick you up in the afternoons ,
you know , after work ,
and we can hang a little , till i get my foster license .
how long will that take ?
uh , hopefully not too long .
until then , we want you to feel at home .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
i really appreciate it . by the way , this is delicious .
aww , thank you .
he can sleep in my room .
my brother &apos;s at boarding school , so there &apos;s an extra bed .
you don &apos;t mind ?
it &apos;s cool . we all share .
except brandon . he has his own room .
is that your son ?
uh , yeah , mine and stef &apos;s .
oh , and lena &apos;s .
i mean , he &apos;s all of ours , really .
so i got a job .
a job ?
well , you don &apos;t have to seem so shocked .
victor offered . at the bakery .
hey . there he is .
hey , babe .
you hungry ?
hey , dad .
let me get you a chair .
who &apos;s this ?
a.j. , this is brandon .
brandon , this is a.j.
a.j. &apos; s gonna be staying with us for a little while .
he &apos;s a foster kid .
oh , we &apos;re fostering another kid ?
oh , we &apos;re not . mike is .
callie met a.j. at the drop @-@ in center .
and he needed a new foster home ,
so i thought of your dad .
why ?
thanks , b.
no , i just ...
it &apos;s not like you &apos;ve ever talked about being a foster parent .
no , but , i mean , i &apos;ve thought about it .
you know , seeing how your moms did
with callie and jude and the twins and--
look , i went to visit a.j.--
visit him ? where ?
in juvie .
juvie ? he was in juvie ?
callie was in juvie when she came here .
it was for a minor offense .
he &apos;s a good kid , b.
he &apos;s just had some tough breaks ,
and maybe i can make a difference in his life .
and i &apos;d like your support .
yeah , yeah ,
i mean , if that &apos;s what you want to do .
i gotta get to work .
look , we &apos;re having dinner tomorrow night , right ?
right .
&apos;night .
you think he &apos;s gonna be okay ?
i think he needs some time to let it sink in .
he was great with the other kids .
well , i &apos;m gonna get going .
thanks for dinner .
and , hey ,
thanks for thinking of me , with a.j. ,
and giving him a home till i can .
it means a lot .
no worries .
have a good night , mike .
what ?
if , for any reason , mike doesn &apos;t follow through--
i know , i know .
and what is jesus doesn &apos;t like boarding school ?
we are not replacing jesus
and we are not fostering another kid , okay ?
come here .
dinner was quite delicious .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
i was having deja vu all through dinner
about callie &apos;s first night with us .
when she asked if we were dykes ?
in comparison , a.j. seems like a dream .
oh my gosh , i almost forgot .
what ?
i &apos;m meeting jenna in , like , 20 minutes .
where are you going ?
girls &apos; night at the laurel .
oh , i can &apos;t remember the last time i went there .
i &apos;m glad to hear that .
maybe if i tell her that we have a new foster kid .
no , no , you can &apos;t cancel this late .
no , i can cancel whenever i want to .
no , just go .
i have things under control here .
i know you do .
who knows ? maybe you &apos;ll meet someone nice .
really .
so you don &apos;t feel weird
sharing your room with some kid you don &apos;t know ?
i &apos;ve been in seven foster homes .
i &apos;ve shared a lot of rooms with a lot of kids i don &apos;t know .
oh , man . sick !
oh , you &apos;re going down .
could you turn that down , please ?
dude , no way . i &apos;m dominating .
seriously , it hurts my ears .
fine .
whatever , granny .
what are you doing ?
you shouldn &apos;t sneak up on people .
you shouldn &apos;t be in here .
so the real kid gets his own room , huh ?
well , we &apos;re all real ,
and everyone had their own rooms
before jude and i came , so ...
look , this &quot; yes , ma &apos;am &quot; act--
i know you don &apos;t appreciate being here ,
and you just wanted to get out of juvie
so that you could run again .
oh , so you can read minds now too ?
i got fired from the drop @-@ in center because of you .
if my moms knew about that , you wouldn &apos;t be here .
so then why didn &apos;t you tell them ?
i was cool with stef helping you with your charges .
i didn &apos;t think that she was gonna ...
bring me home ,
like some pound puppy ?
look , if you don &apos;t want me here ,
why don &apos;t you go tell them right now ?
what &apos;s going on ?
i was just showing a.j. around .
the tour &apos;s over .
&apos;night .
&apos;night .
it &apos;s a nice crib .
glad you like it .
god , why did everybody get so young ?
oh , they didn &apos;t . we got old .
oh , hey . what about her ?
what , the one with the short hair ?
uh @-@ huh , yeah .
she could be your daughter , jenna .
how dare you ? you ...
you can &apos;t date women who--
who &apos;ve watched &quot; friends &quot; for the first time on netflix , come on .
unfortunately , those girls are my only option .
i mean , let &apos;s face it ,
if they &apos;re my age and they &apos;re still single ,
then there &apos;s probably a reason .
jenna , i hate to tell you this ,
but you are your age and still single .
oh , wait a minute . okay , don &apos;t look now ,
but there is a gorgeous ,
age @-@ appropriate woman in the bar .
no , don &apos;t look now .
just wait for it . wait .
okay , wait , wait .
okay , now . now .
which one ? the redhead ? the glasses ?
no , the brunette . the one in the middle of the bar , there .
right there .
oh my god . i know her .
you know her ?
yeah , she &apos;s ... she &apos;s lena &apos;s boss .
really ?
well , then send me to the principal &apos;s office ,
&apos;cause i &apos;ve been a naughty girl .
settle down , tiger . she &apos;s straight .
what ? how do you know ?
because she was married to a man .
you were married to a man .
so ?
so what ?
oh , nothing . just our hot new foster brother .
he &apos;s not our foster brother .
good point . so he &apos;s in play .
you have a boyfriend .
not for me , for you .
you haven &apos;t had a boyfriend since ...
wyatt ? yeah , i know .
i have more important things to think about .
like what ?
like finding a new independent study .
what happened to your old independent study ?
i got fired from the drop @-@ in center .
i don &apos;t want to talk about it . and no , moms don &apos;t know yet ,
and i don &apos;t want to tell them until i find another one ,
so please don &apos;t say anything .
okay .
did you do something bad ?
mariana .
sorry .
i &apos;m sorry it &apos;s so small . it &apos;s the only one i could find
that didn &apos;t have action figures all over it .
it &apos;s cool .
oh , and callie told me that you like to draw ,
so feel free to use any of the pencils here on jesus &apos;s desk .
did he do something wrong ?
is that why you guys sent him away ?
no , no . he &apos;s a wrestler .
he got a scholarship . he wanted to go .
so am i , like , the first black kid you fostered ?
yes .
why do you ask ?
it &apos;s just not a lot of people want to take in a black boy ,
let alone two .
that &apos;s why me and my brother got separated .
well , that is not true for us .
we &apos;re really glad you &apos;re here , a.j.
&apos;night , bubba .
&apos;night .
good night .
i grind my teeth sometimes at night .
but , you know , just throw a pillow at me if it keeps you up .
that &apos;s what jesus always did .
okay . that &apos;s good to know .
are you sure i can &apos;t get you a coffee ?
already three cups in .
any more caffeine , and i &apos;m likely to get coffee gut .
well , looks like you got a lot of water damage up there .
that pipe &apos;s probably been leaking for months .
so we &apos;re told . so how soon can you get us a quote ?
i can email it to you , end of day .
should i send it to you or your husband ?
&apos;morning .
stef , this is carl .
hi , carl . how is it going ?
so are you two sisters or ...
no , she &apos;s my wife .
so you can just get that quote to me .
you &apos;ve got my email .
okay .
will do .
have a good day , carl .
sisters ? seriously ?
how many of these quotes do we have to get ?
at least three .
so how was your drinks with jenna ?
um , hmm , interesting .
yeah ? did you meet your future second wife ?
no , i didn &apos;t , but she seems to think she did .
really ? she met someone ?
mm @-@ hmm .
what &apos;s she like ?
let &apos;s see . she &apos;s pretty ,
brunette ,
works as a principal at a charter school .
really ? here in san diego ? what &apos;s her name ?
monte porter .
did you know she was gay ?
she was ... she was married to a man .
i was married to a man , lena .
just because she was at a gay bar doesn &apos;t mean ...
she was on a date with a woman that she met online .
how do you know that ?
because jenna made me introduce her .
well , that must have been a little awkward .
well , it gets better . she wants you to set them up .
okay , well ,
i am not setting up my boss with one of our friends .
fine .
no .
you tell jenna , then .
i &apos;m not telling her .
oh , speak of the devil .
yeah , we were just talking about it .
she is . she is . she &apos;s right here .
here , let me put you on video chat . there we go .
hi , jenna .
hi , lena .
i am obsessed with your boss .
you &apos;ve got to set me up .
how about you have us over for dinner ?
and that way it won &apos;t be so awkward .
jenna , i really don &apos;t think ...
oh , please , come on .
you have no idea how bleak it is out there .
so bleak .
oh , and you gotta do it soon ,
before she has a second date with that loser from last night ,
because you know what lesbians brings on the second date .
a u @-@ haul .
a u @-@ haul , i know .
you know what ? we &apos;re not doing anything tonight .
tonight ?
yes , tonight ? tonight ? i can make tonight work .
i will do all the shopping and cooking ,
so you won &apos;t even have to lift a finger .
okay , let me know what she says . i am so excited .
thank you . you are the best friend in the world .
hey . what &apos;s up ?
sorry , mama asked if her phone was in here .
yeah , yeah , it &apos;s over on the bedside table .
you okay ?
weren &apos;t you scared of guns after you were shot ?
yeah , i guess i was a little bit more nervous
carrying a firearm than i had been before .
what did you do ?
well , i went to the shooting range
and practiced and practiced and practiced
until i felt comfortable and confident again .
i remember the sound the most .
it was so loud .
yeah , i remember that too .
i think i just ...
i don &apos;t understand how connor can play those ,
you know , shooter games .
i mean , he was the one who was shot .
yeah , well , you were shot at .
that &apos;s every bit as traumatic .
and listen to me ,
it &apos;s not a bad thing to be afraid of guns .
you hear me ?
now take that to mama .
okay , i &apos;m so happy you &apos;re here .
i &apos;m the only employee that &apos;s under 50 .
it &apos;s like an old folks &apos; home .
really ?
seriously .
the last person who worked with me was my great @-@ aunt amelia .
and she was 92 .
is she ...
retired . it was time .
she was really gassy ,
and she couldn &apos;t hold it in anymore .
let &apos;s just say it wasn &apos;t good for business .
look at you two .
i &apos;m happy my beautiful granddaughters are getting along
and getting to know each other .
and elena and i are looking forward
to spending more time together with you , mariana .
oh , thanks . me too .
now back to work .
okay , so what do we do ?
you &apos;re looking at it . we stand here
and wait for customers to come in .
and we wait , and we wait .
business hasn &apos;t really been that great .
okay , so mike will pick you up
out here this afternoon .
and if you need anything ,
you can always find me in my office , okay ?
yes , ma &apos;am .
i mean , lena .
okay , guys , have a good day .
this is where you go to school ?
yep .
and there &apos;s , like , no gates or fences or anything ?
nope .
you &apos;re free to take off whenever you want .
good morning .
morning .
so i guess--
stef told--
sorry , you go .
sorry , you go .
look , i--
it &apos;s been really hard to meet people ,
so i signed up for one of those dating sites .
and when i was checking the boxes ,
i just thought ...
you know , it hasn &apos;t worked out great for me with men ,
so why not check all the boxes ?
i mean , not all the boxes .
some of them are weird .
but the last thing i expected
on my first date ever with a woman
was to run into your wife .
you don &apos;t have to explain .
no , i do .
i-- i told you i was straight ,
and i don &apos;t even know if i &apos;m bisexual or whatever .
i just--
i just thought i should keep an open mind ,
because , you know , i really would like to meet someone nice .
damn , this boy is hot .
he &apos;s all right .
and he &apos;s a rock star . you scored , girl .
aww , you miss him . that &apos;s so sweet .
who &apos;s wyatt ?
no one .
no one ?
just a friend . so what do you do
with all the extra bread and pastries at the end of the day ?
we give most of it to the homeless shelters or to food kitchens .
they must love us .
abuelo victor says that it &apos;s getting harder
to compete with the grocery store bakeries .
well , makes sense . the only small bakeries or cafes i know
all have some trendy little dessert that everyone wants to try ,
like the &quot; pie @-@ kie &quot; or the &quot; cronut . &quot;
what about the &quot; churronut &quot; ?
a churro and a donut ?
that &apos;s brilliant .
i know , but sbuelo shot it down .
why ?
&quot; trends come and go ,
&quot; pero la tradicion es para siempre . &quot;
well , i don &apos;t see any customers coming or going ,
so maybe we need to convince him to try some new tradiciones .
how ?
demand @-@ side economics .
wait , what ?
i got this .
i &apos;m telling you , the new zombie mode
is , like , supposed to be a gore @-@ fest ,
like , there &apos;s body parts flying and just ...
you gotta come over tomorrow so we can play it .
i can &apos;t come over tomorrow .
come on , what &apos;s up with you ?
nothing . i just ... have plans .
what plans ?
i &apos;m going to a shooting range .
seriously ?
with my mom .
she &apos;s gonna teach me how to shoot a gun-- a real gun .
i want to shoot a gun . can i come ?
well , i don &apos;t know .
would your dad even let you ?
he hunts . and your mom &apos;s a cop .
there &apos;s , like , no one safer to go with .
i mean , i &apos;m sure he &apos;d be cool with it .
can you ask ?
come on , just ask .
so i need to find a new independent study project ,
and i was thinking i could do a paper
on the history of the foster care system ,
and why it was created as an alternative
to orphanages in the united states .
well , if you can sell it to the administration ...
great . thank you so much .
oh , good .
sorry , i was just checking out the beach .
pretty crazy , right ?
i could get used to it .
so what do you want to do ?
i wouldn &apos;t mind watching the game .
i wouldn &apos;t mind either .
frankly , i don &apos;t even think that jenna &apos;s monte &apos;s type .
how would you know what her type is ?
you didn &apos;t even know she was gay .
neither does she , which also worries me for jenna .
hey , boo . what &apos;s up ?
hey . can i help with dinner ?
aren &apos;t you sweet ?
but actually we have friends coming over last @-@ minute .
and we are gonna order you guys some pizza . is that okay ?
sure .
so , mom .
yeah ?
i was thinking about what you said
about how after you were shot
you went to the shooting range and you felt better .
and i was thinking
maybe you could take me ,
so you could teach me to shoot .
why would you want to learn how to shoot a gun ?
i just don &apos;t want to be scared .
well , i think you should be scared .
why don &apos;t you let mama and i talk about it ?
all right ?
okay .
it &apos;s just i sort of
told connor that you were gonna take me ,
and now he wants to come too .
okay , let us talk , all right ?
well , i hope you agree the answer is no .
hey , you &apos;re early .
yeah , traffic was light .
i hope it &apos;s okay-- i invited a.j. to dinner .
uh , yeah , sure .
great .
i tape this so we can watch it later .
no , that &apos;s okay . i &apos;ll watch .
you sure ?
yeah .
who &apos;s playing ?
dude , it &apos;s the finals . how do you not know who &apos;s playing ?
brandon &apos;s not really into sports .
music &apos;s his thing .
he actually got accepted into a very prestigious music camp
as a classical composer .
dad .
what , i can &apos;t brag about my super @-@ talented son ?
so if you &apos;re not into sports ,
what &apos;s up with that tony gwynn ball in your room ?
that was a gift from my grandfather .
he was a big padres fan .
me and my brother used to watch the game
from up on the water tower by the stadium .
you know what , b ? we should take a.j. to a game .
i got a buddy who can get us seats behind home plate .
for real ?
yeah , for real .
speaking of my brother . have you heard anything ?
the good news is , we have every reason to believe he &apos;s alive .
there &apos;s no death certificate issued under his name ,
no john doe that fits his description .
i mean , look , i can keep running his name through the system ,
but i gotta be honest--
unless he commits a crime ,
it &apos;s not easy to find someone who doesn &apos;t want to be found .
how do i look ?
verizon say neversettle .
oh my god .
i-- i mean , hi .
anyhow , when lena met stef ,
stef and i became fast friends .
and then , lucky for me ,
i got them both in the divorce .
yeah , lucky for her is right .
wait , so i &apos;ve never heard the story of how you two met .
well , i was-- i--
well , i thought i was straight
and separated from brandon &apos;s father ,
looking for a school for brandon .
and , lo and behold , guess who was the head of admissions but ...
and i started lingering after drop @-@ off ,
um , then we went to lunch and to dinner ,
and then i kissed her . and her face--
it was so cute .
i think she was a little surprised .
of course , i was still trying to convince myself
that i was into men .
and lena was in a relationship .
which wasn &apos;t serious , obviously .
but i knew i was in love .
well , who wouldn &apos;t be ? i mean , look at her .
i &apos;d marry her right now .
i &apos;m kidding . i mean , i &apos;m totally kidding .
anyhow , it &apos;s not like you just suddenly were gay .
i mean , you had crushes . and you had--
you had that whole thing with the girl in college .
come on , every girl had something in college .
no , no , not everyone . i didn &apos;t .
you didn &apos;t ?
i didn &apos;t know that .
how about you , monte ? did you ?
no , actually .
i-- i mean , i &apos;ve had crushes , i guess .
so who &apos;s ready for some dessert ?
you know , i am . but i need to use the restroom first .
do you remember where it is ?
i do , yeah . excuse me .
stop looking at her ass , jenna .
monte .
hi , callie .
can i come and talk to you tomorrow ?
i have something i want to ask you about my independent study ,
if that would be okay .
okay .
why don &apos;t you come by my office tomorrow after class ?
excuse me , i gotta use the little girls &apos; room .
what &apos;s with him ?
beats me . i hardly know the guy .
you really trust him ?
why do you ask ?
you &apos;re the reason he &apos;s here , right ?
well , did you trust me when i first got here ?
i don &apos;t know . but you were a lot prettier .
so what you &apos;re saying is i &apos;m not pretty anymore ?
i just don &apos;t want to see my dad get played , you know ?
i gotta get to work .
okay , can we talk about jenna
when monte walked into the kitchen ?
&quot; wow . &quot; what was that ?
she has no filter .
yeah , i think i detected a little bit of a spark though .
i still don &apos;t think monte &apos;s a lesbian .
what ?
and if they dated ,
i just-- i wouldn &apos;t feel comfortable with jenna
sharing personal stuff about us with my boss .
you shared personal stuff about us with your boss .
and that was a mistake .
i regret it . and i &apos;m sorry .
and i have been very careful
not to cross that line again .
thank you .
oh , you know , adam called me and said
that apparently connor is very , very excited
about going to the shooting range .
and he said it &apos;s okay if i take him , so ...
you &apos;ve never taken any of the other kids .
i know . maybe i should .
we &apos;ve got a gun in the house .
i know i keep it locked up ,
but , you know , it &apos;s not a bad thing
to teach them about gun safety ,
especially if they &apos;re curious .
honestly , it doesn &apos;t seem like jude
to be curious about something like this .
you really think he &apos;s gonna feel better after shooting a gun ?
i don &apos;t know . maybe .
i did .
校长
i just wanted to say thank you again for last night .
i hope jenna wasn &apos;t too--
no , but , i mean , i did think
she was a little ...
enthusiastic ?
at first .
but then ,
well , we actually went out for a drink
after we left your house .
and she &apos;s very funny and interesting .
so you think you want to see her again ?
i &apos;d like to .
unless you don &apos;t want me to , for some reason .
i don &apos;t want you to date any women .
i mean--
what i mean is that ...
i want you to be straight .
because if you &apos;re straight ,
then there &apos;s no reason
for me to tell my wife that you tried to kiss me ,
because it really didn &apos;t mean anything .
but if you &apos;re gay , then not telling her ...
is like a betrayal .
so what if you tell her ?
she &apos;s certainly not gonna feel great about us working together .
so sorry i put you in this position ,
but it &apos;s not like you kissed me .
it &apos;s just something stupid i did .
and if it &apos;s just gonna make stef uncomfortable ,
is there really any point ?
so manifest destiny
was stimulated by nationalism ,
but also by an idealistic vision
of human perfectibility .
now it was believed at the time
that it was america &apos;s duty to extend
liberty and democratic institutions
across the continent .
uh , excuse me .
are you not interested in manifest destiny ?
no , just destined for the bathroom .
is that okay ?
yeah .
so , as i was saying , manifest--
can i use the bathroom too , please ?
callie , you know the rules . one at a time .
so in 1836 ...
i just had a customer
who asked about our churronuts ,
third one today , in fact .
you know , that &apos;s so funny ,
because we actually had someone ask us the exact same thing .
i wonder where people are getting the idea
we served something trendy like that ?
hmm , i wonder .
but , i mean , it &apos;s what the people want .
actually , i know where .
i asked one young lady , and she said
she got something called a &quot; tweet &quot;
sent to her from someone called
@ marianamissthing ?
okay , but before you say anything ,
take a look .
* m &apos;m&apos;m &apos;my churronut *
isn &apos;t it awesome ?
mariana &apos;s , like , a computer genius .
it is awesome .
but we don &apos;t sell churronuts ,
not now , not ever .
because ...
tradicion es para siempre .
but this bakery isn &apos;t going to be forever
if you don &apos;t do something to bring business in .
mariana , you &apos;re new to this family ,
but you--
you know better , mija .
i &apos;m so sorry .
this is gonna be awesome .
okay , did you guys see me practice .
the three &quot; always , &quot; like we talked about ? what are they ?
always point the firearm in a safe direction .
right .
always assume it &apos;s loaded . and , um ...
always keep your finger
off the trigger until you &apos;re ready to fire .
good job . all right , jude , you want to go first ?
okay .
all right .
all right , now your stance is ,
your feet are shoulder @-@ width apart , okay ?
pick up the gun . finger off the trigger . well done .
and you &apos;re gonna use this hand to cup
underneath your dominant hand . there you go .
now you &apos;re gonna line this sight up
in between these two sights back here .
okay .
okay , go for it .
jude ?
i don &apos;t want to shoot it .
why not ?
i don &apos;t need to .
all right . you want to give it a shot ?
yeah , totally .
okay , your stance ... feet are shoulder @-@ width apart .
finger off the trigger . okay ?
you line up your sights-- this one in between these two .
yeah , i know how to do it . it &apos;s just like in the game .
who &apos;s there ?
you okay ?
yeah , yeah , i &apos;m okay . that was cool .
yeah .
want to sit down for a sec ?
no , i &apos;m okay .
i &apos;m actually ... i &apos;m gonna go wait outside .
where &apos;s a.j. ?
he &apos;s gone .
you think he might be here ?
i don &apos;t know .
this is where he used to come to meet his brother
when they were in separate homes .
maybe he thinks he &apos;ll find him here .
it &apos;s a pretty big park .
you okay if we split up ?
yeah .
okay .
you got your phone ?
yeah .
you okay ?
i &apos;m fine .
i never wanted to shoot a gun .
my mom wasn &apos;t gonna take me shooting .
i just said that because i was embarrassed
that i didn &apos;t want to play that zombie game .
why were you embarrassed ?
you call me a granny .
i don &apos;t know . i guess i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m not okay .
you know , it was my dad who took me to the gun range
for the first time when i was about your age .
man , was i excited to shoot a real gun .
i walked up to that firing line ,
aiming my gun for the head and fired
and immediately burst into tears .
i was so embarrassed .
i knew my dad was gonna give me a hard time about it .
but you know what ? he didn &apos;t .
he said he was really proud of me
for recognizing that shooting a gun is not a game .
it &apos;s very , very real and has very real consequences .
he always told me that his goal as a police officer
was to never have to shoot his firearm on the job .
never did . never got shot at .
and we can &apos;t say that , can we ?
we can talk about it though , you know .
i know i need to .
it &apos;s important . it &apos;s important for me , that &apos;s for sure .
i didn &apos;t remember much after it happened .
but now sometimes ...
you dream about it ?
yeah , me too .
it &apos;s weird . it &apos;s not the same .
it &apos;s not the same scenario ...
a.j.
what are you doing here ?
it &apos;s a free country .
this where you and your brother used to meet ?
being up here would make me feel like a superhero too .
so what &apos;s the plan ?
just gonna wait up here until he shows , if he shows ?
why do you care ?
you don &apos;t want me around .
mike does .
he &apos;s not gonna look for ty .
who says ?
he said .
he said it &apos;s a waste of time .
he said you can &apos;t find someone that doesn &apos;t want to be found .
well , he &apos;s here ,
wasting his time looking for you right now .
so ...
i &apos;ve been where you are .
and at a certain point , you just ...
you have to learn to trust somebody .
ty is not gonna know where to find me .
so you &apos;ll find him .
and mike will help you .
i quit . you don &apos;t need the help ,
and you don &apos;t have to pay me to get to know me .
and i may not know how things work in this family ,
but i do know that business is bad
and things aren &apos;t going to get better by refusing to try new things .
and adriana just wants to help you , because she loves you .
okay .
well , that &apos;s all i wanted to say ,
except it might interest you to know
that a cronut sells for approximately $ 6 apiece ,
which is seven times more than a donut
and 3.5 times more than a croissant ,
which i don &apos;t have to tell you is a high profit ...
okay .
okay what ?
let &apos;s make churronuts .
did you hear that ? we &apos;re making churronuts !
aren &apos;t you supposed to , like , arrest me or something ?
nah , i &apos;m off duty .
besides , i didn &apos;t see anything .
you sure you &apos;re okay with me putting your number up here ?
you know what ? i hadn &apos;t even thought of that .
can you take it down ?
yeah .
i &apos;m kidding .
it &apos;s not my number .
it &apos;s yours .
i got you this for before ,
you know , in case we ever needed to get in touch with each other .
now , if ty shows up , he can get in touch too .
come on , let &apos;s get you home .
* m &apos;m&apos;m &apos;my churronuts *
okay , come with me right now .
where are we going ?
i need your help .
it &apos;s an app ?
i &apos;m gonna call it &quot; fost and found , &quot;
so foster kids can find each other and communicate .
i think this is a great idea .
mariana &apos;s gonna help me code .
i am .
okay , but what happened to the drop @-@ in center ?
well , this is a drop @-@ in center ...
just for kids who can &apos;t physically drop in .
is this what you wanted to talk to monte about ?
uh , no . i mean , sort of .
i actually just got this idea from a.j.
this app would kind of be
like giving every kid their own bat signal .
and , mariana , you &apos;re gonna have time to help out with this ?
i guess .
i mean , totally .
i don &apos;t see any reason why monte
and the teachers &apos; board wouldn &apos;t approve this .
thank you . thank you .
okay , why don &apos;t you two go set the table for dinner , please ?
i would say a.j. &apos; s been a good influence so far .
what the hell are you doing ?
