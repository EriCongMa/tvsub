you &apos;re marrying him for his money ?
lynette had reservations about her mother &apos;s marriage .
you can &apos;t marry an obnoxious jerk like that .
susan began her wait for a kidney donor .
i &apos;m going on the wait list .
that could take years .
bree found out that keith had a son
but decided not to tell him ...
keith feels that it would be too difficult for everyone .
easing her guilt with a check .
get out of the car !
oh , god !
gaby &apos;s obsession with her doll ...
i gotta get my baby !
get out !
nearly cost her life .
my baby !
gaby ! it &apos;s not grace !
and paul recognized the gun that was used to shoot him .
paul young had a son .
but he had not seen zach in years .
he had lost him to a world of fast women ...
easy money ...
and hard drugs .
yes , paul had lost his son ...
but he was determined to find him .
and he would do anything ...
even if that meant asking for help ...
from a man who despised him .
what the hell are you doing here ?
i need a favor .
from me ?
i know . you hate me , and i hate you .
now that we &apos;re done with our traditional greeting ,
can i tell you what i want ?
yeah , go ahead .
i need to find zach .
i went to that mansion his grandfather left him .
it &apos;s in foreclosure .
yeah , i heard about that .
do you know where he went ?
yeah , i don &apos;t know where he is .
and even if i did , why would i do you any favors ?
zach &apos;s the one who shot me .
what ?
the police showed me the gun .
it was the same one mary alice used to kill herself .
and zach kept it ?
he &apos;s always been a strange boy .
if you really think he tried to kill you ,
why didn &apos;t you tell the police ?
i &apos;d like to keep this in the family .
so again , where is he ?
last i heard , idaho .
well ...
if you hear from him ,
tell him i know what he did ...
and i &apos;m very disappointed .
though he didn &apos;t admit it ,
mike knew exactly where zach was .
but the son paul young had lost ...
had no interest in being found .
it doesn &apos;t matter where we &apos;re going .
it doesn &apos;t matter how quickly we try to get there .
it doesn &apos;t matter that we never look back .
the past we left behind will still find a way
to catch up to us .
i &apos;m making grilled salmon . why did you get a pizza ?
because you &apos;re making grilled salmon .
i wish you wouldn &apos;t put that terrible food in your body .
it &apos;s not good for you .
come on .
you know you want a bite .
ah . eat it . eat it .
seriously , i have better @-@ tasting food under my refrigerator .
hello ?
hi , bree . it &apos;s amber .
i &apos;m sorry to bother you .
oh , no , no bother .
look , i &apos;m outside . i need to talk to you .
no , uh , don &apos;t come over . i &apos;ll , um , come to you .
see you soon .
i need to run to lynette &apos;s for a minute .
do you mind waiting for dinner ?
hurry up . i &apos;m starved .
hi .
so the bank says your check is gonna take 5 days to clear .
is there any way you can get me a cashier &apos;s check ?
i really need to pay some bills .
absolutely .
um , there &apos;s a restaurant across from the bank .
i can meet you there tomorrow at 2 : 00 .
that &apos;ll be great . thank you again , bree .
bree , wait .
i know keith doesn &apos;t wanna meet charlie .
but he should at least know what his son looks like .
i &apos;m sure he &apos;ll appreciate that .
so according to the donor database ,
i will be waiting three to four years .
where does that put me on the list ?
i @-@ i mean , is there a number ?
there is no number .
it all boils down to your d.n.a.
and how long you &apos;ve been waiting .
so , you have your beeper .
yep .
four years is a long time .
susan bremer ?
yeah ?
monroe carter . from fairview high .
i sat behind you in chem lab .
i was yearbook photographer ?
now i sell pharmaceutical supplies .
you know , i friended you on facebook ,
like , 12 times .
i guess i didn &apos;t get them .
no worries . tell me , what &apos;s new ?
how are you ?
i need a kidney transplant .
i &apos;m gonna be spending the next three to four years
on dialysis three times a week ,
five hours a day .
wow . i @-@ i didn &apos;t know .
then again , if you &apos;d friended me ...
i &apos;ll see you at the reunion ...
if i &apos;m still alive .
you like ? frank gave them to me .
they belonged to my first wife .
she &apos;s dead .
isn &apos;t that a little ... weird ?
hell , no . this necklace belonged to his second wife ,
and she &apos;s sitting right over there .
that &apos;s weird .
well , i have to admit , you two seem very happy together .
tell her about saturday .
what about saturday ?
frank wants you to bring tom and the kids back up here .
i wanna take a family portrait .
family is very important to frank .
and since my first three families aren &apos;t speaking to me ,
i wanna get this one right ,
so i can rub it in their miserable faces .
oh , that &apos;s a sweet thought ,
but saturdays are kind of crazy for us .
penny &apos;s got ballet , paker &apos;s studying for the s.a.t.s--
well , how about i make it worth your while ?
you &apos;re bribing me ?
call it gas money if it &apos;ll make you feel any better .
will $ 500 do it ?
i &apos;m not taking his money .
frank , i @-@ isn &apos;t it time for your heart medicine ?
look how she takes care of me .
do what you have to do to make this work .
but i &apos;m not going over a grand .
what are you doing ?
i just married the man .
he &apos;s in the process of redoing his will ,
so we &apos;ve gotta play ball .
no . i am not gonna bend over backwards
just to please that jerk .
you &apos;re the one who married him , not me .
i can &apos;t tell frank no .
but i can tell you no .
so if you want the picture , you can come to our house .
fine . i &apos;ll talk to him .
and will you stop staring at this necklace , phyllis ?
you are not getting it back !
so the fashion show ends , and yves saint laurent--
who doesn &apos;t swim , by the way--
rents a yacht for the after @-@ party .
and that &apos;s where i met mick jagger .
do you have any wine ?
we don &apos;t really do wine in therapy .
ah . well , you should .
a few glasses , and you &apos;d have your patients
whining about how daddy didn &apos;t love &apos; em in half the time .
did your father not love you ?
i was joking .
my dad was great .
he died when i was a kid .
well , that must have been hard ....
growing up without a male presence ?
no . she remarried .
oh , my god .
i forgot to tell you the best part of the jagger story .
he read my palm .
and he told me i would be going below deck
to have sex with him .
not only is he a great singer ,
he &apos;s an amazing psychic .
gaby , why don &apos;t you like talking about your childhood ?
what &apos;s the point ? the past is the past .
well , sometimes what happens to us in the past
affects who we are today .
oh , by the way , jagger-- big cuddler .
gaby , come on . we &apos;re gonna have to go deeper here .
well , that &apos;s the thing about me--there is no deeper .
ask any of my friends .
i &apos;m the shallowest person they know .
i &apos;m just skin , a little blood ,
and stories about keith richards drinking out of my shoes .
you don &apos;t have to be afraid .
let &apos;s talk about your childhood .
i love therapy .
really ?
yeah . it &apos;s like a talk show ,
where i &apos;m the guest and the only topic is me .
so it &apos;s helping ?
you talked to her about the doll ?
ya @-@ bup @-@ bup @-@ bup @-@ bup !
that is confidential . first rule of therapy .
actually , first rule of therapy is no wine ,
but i &apos;m gonna change that .
i &apos;m so glad this is working . i &apos;ve been worried about you .
it &apos;s exactly what i needed .
in fact , i &apos;m gonna be going three times a week--
mondays , thursdays , and fridays .
wow , that &apos;s a lot .
well , it was your idea .
oh , by the way , uh ,
you &apos;re gonna have to take over my carpools on mondays .
that &apos;s okay , right ?
sure . i guess i could move some things around .
oh ! and no golf on thursdays ,
because you &apos;ll have to take juanita to ballet .
gaby , i do business on the links .
do you want me to get better or not ?
okay .
okay . i will cancel golf .
oh , and on friday , i have a gynecologist appointment .
gaby !
that i need you to cancel .
wouldn &apos;t that be great , though ?
hi .
hi .
i see you brought charlie .
well , you know , i don &apos;t have anyone to watch him .
i have your cashier &apos;s check .
thank you again , bree .
honey , let &apos;s go .
no . i haven &apos;t finished my pizza .
let &apos;s go .
no !
listen , bree , do you mind keeping an eye on him ?
the bank is right across the way .
i &apos;ll only be ten minutes .
i don &apos;t know . i @-@ i--
just order some pizza . it &apos;ll be on me .
so , charlie ...
i &apos;m gonna play games .
right .
much better than conversation .
oh . mr. lynwood .
susan .
my beeper went off . does that mean--
yes , we found you a donor .
oh , but how ? you said it would probably take years .
the rules change if someone wants to donate a kidney
to a specific individual .
wait . uh ... this is someone i know ?
apparently .
he &apos;s in my office right now signing the paperwork .
it &apos;s a he ?
i &apos;m getting a man kidney ?
not that i &apos;m complaining .
oh , my god .
hey , susan .
monroe . you &apos;re my donor ?
yeah . turns out i &apos;m a match . what are the odds ?
i don &apos;t know what to say .
well , i &apos;m giving you a vital organ .
how about &quot; thank you &quot; ?
why would you do this ?
we haven &apos;t seen each other in years , and ...
i barely remembered you .
i remembered you .
you were really wonderful to me in high school .
and you &apos;re in trouble ,
and i wanna help .
well ... thank you .
so what &apos;s a guy gotta do to get a hug ?
give you a lung ?
oh , come here , you !
oh , please know you &apos;ve made me very happy .
i &apos;m so glad .
busted .
i &apos;m on my way to mrs. goodman &apos;s place to finish that job ,
and what do i see ?
your car , parked in front of a pizza joint .
yeah , about that--
admit it . you &apos;re hooked .
what are you , a deep @-@ dish girl ? thin crust ?
yep . you got me .
i am a closet pizza lover .
mystery solved . you can go to your job now .
i need more quarters .
who &apos;s this ? what do you got , some secret boyfriend ?
this is , um , charlie .
i &apos;m , uh , watching , uh , him for a friend of mine .
i &apos;m sorry , charlie . i don &apos;t have any more change .
now , could you excuse us ?
you got quarters ?
i got some .
come on .
what about mrs. goodman ?
she &apos;s lived without a screen door for 30 years .
she can wait another half hour .
all right . let &apos;s see what you got .
i &apos;m gonna show you something . this is a secret , all right ?
but this is just between you and me . hand ...
in the cookie jar . bang . let &apos;s see it .

bye !
bye . remember me when you &apos;re on the lakers .
they &apos;re here !
whoa . frank drives a bentley .
of course he does .
why are we taking this stupid picture ?
i mean , we barely even know the guy .
we &apos;re doing it for your grandma .
and the lovely man she just married .
hello ! welcome !
hello , everybody !
hey , grandma .
so , this really is where they live .
i thought you were kiddin &apos; .
how was the drive over , frank ?
it took forever .
we got behind this asian woman driver--
slow as soy sauce going uphill in winter .
okay . small talk &apos;s over . let &apos;s take the picture .
we were all thinking we &apos;d sit over here .
no , i don &apos;t wanna see your crappy kitchen in the background there .
let &apos;s move this sofa over there . i want it to be real homey .
cagney and lacey , grab this end of the couch .
what are you doing ?
you can &apos;t just walk into people &apos;s houses
and move furniture around .
when it looks like this , you can .
uh--no , no , no . put it back .
it &apos;s bad enough you make me drive all the way out here
to east podunk . well , bull !
i want my picture , my way !
hey !
whatever you say .
frank , that &apos;s too heavy . you &apos;re all red .
well , that &apos;s &apos; cause the girls here were not much help .
okay , everyone . come and take your place around ...
grandpa frank .
okay .
here we go .
everybody smile and say &quot; bentley . &quot;
bentley .
okay . nobody move . i wanna check that it &apos;s good .
ooh . hang on .
we have to do it again . frank , your eyes are closed .
frank ?
frank ?
oh , no .
what &apos;s wrong ?
he &apos;s dead .
of course he is .
there &apos;s no pulse .
no pulse . he &apos;s definitely dead .
is his ghost gonna be trapped in our house ?
is he gonna haunt us ?
no , honey . of course not .
gross . a dead guy &apos;s on our couch .
and i &apos;m having friends over .
how long till he starts to smell ?
kids , go upstairs . there &apos;s nothing to see here .
whoa . what are you talking about ? there &apos;s a dead body .
that &apos;s totally something to see .
okay , kids . come on . let &apos;s go . upstairs .
come on .
mom , i &apos;m so sorry .
i can &apos;t believe he &apos;s gone . just like that .
i know . i know .
what are you doing ?
uh , i &apos;m calling the police
so they can get a coroner over here .
uh , hang on . y @-@ you can &apos;t call them yet .
why not ?
that new will i told you about--
the one leaving everything to me ?
it doesn &apos;t go into effect until tomorrow .
oh , no .
no , no .
you want me to keep him here ?
like that ? all night ?
if we call the coroner now ,
i get nothing .
if we call in the morning ...
millions .
i didn &apos;t want frank in my house when he was alive .
now you want me to hang out with his corpse ?
well , then throw a sheet over him
and spray a little air freshener .
you won &apos;t even notice .
frank wanted me to have that money .
no ! i @-@ it &apos;s too weird !
y @-@ you wouldn &apos;t have to take care of me anymore .
in fact , i could even take care of you .
college tuition ? braces ?
it would make me feel so good
to be able to help you for a change .
it &apos;s been a long time , son .
yeah , i guess .
how &apos;s it going ?
i couldn &apos;t be better .
what , uh , can i do for ya ? wait , wait , wait .
let me guess . you want money .
i nailed it , didn &apos;t i ? uh , but you can see ,
a lot of other people-- they ... they got here first .
well , sorry to hear that .
who cares ? it &apos;s time to downsize , minimize my carbon footprint .
you feeling okay , buddy ?
i feel great .
sounds like you &apos;re the one having problems .
well , susan and i are going through a rough time ,
like a lot of people .
so how screwed are you ?
we had to rent out our house ...
to your father , in fact .
my father &apos;s in prison .
he &apos;s out .
you didn &apos;t know ?
no .
you sure you &apos;re okay ?
i just can &apos;t believe
that bastard gets to walk free after everything that he did !
i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t mean to upset you .
it &apos;s--it &apos;s okay . just ...
could you leave ? i @-@ i @-@ i @-@ i need to be alone . just ...
tom ...
you never sneak up behind someone
when they &apos;re staring at a dead person !
i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s just ... your scream ...
it was like all the testosterone left your body at once .
this whole thing creeps me out .
it &apos;s just ...
a body .
how do you become this guy ?
9 kids , 14 grandchildren ,
and you never talk to any of them .
that &apos;s the tricky thing about money .
changes people .
changes relationships .
it sure does .
and after you &apos;re dead , what &apos;s it all mean ?
not funny .
hello .
hi . this is maria . i &apos;m just calling to confirm
gabrielle solis for her 1 : 00 appointment .
yep . she &apos;s on her way .
terrific . you wouldn &apos;t happen to know
what kind of treatment she wants today , do you ?
uh , i don &apos;t know .
whatever you &apos;ve been doing seems to be working .
well , on monday she got the seaweed wrap ,
wednesday the hot stone massage . we just want to make sure
she takes full advantage of our entire spa menu .
oh , she is taking full advantage , all right .
oh , good , sandro . there you are .
i think we should start on my shoulders today .
mm . that &apos;s good .
maybe a little lighter on the pressure .
no , no . lighter .
okay , maybe let &apos;s not do the shoulders .
okay . how about the glutes ?
carlos ? what are you doing here ?
what are you doing here ? you &apos;re supposed to be in therapy .
this is therapy ! didn &apos;t you see the sign ?
&quot; massage therapy , &quot; &quot; aroma therapy . &quot;
i talked to dr. wyner . she said that
you haven &apos;t been back since the first session . why not ?
well ... i just don &apos;t think i really need it .
i mean , this is really helping .
no . this is ignoring the problem .
you know , the way you say &quot; problem , &quot;
you make it seem a whole lot worse than it actually is .
gaby , you almost got us killed pulling a doll out of the car .
fine . if it &apos;ll get you off my ass ,
i &apos;ll make an appointment for next week .
now get your clothes on . we &apos;re leaving .
god , now i &apos;m so tense .
i &apos;ll give you 100 bucks
if you work on my shoulders for ten minutes . aah !
that &apos;s for free . let &apos;s go .
he--he came downstairs just after midnight to watch some tv ,
and we didn &apos;t find him until this morning .
well , in that case ,
i &apos;ll just put down time of death around 3 : 00 a.m.
would you like us
to bring the body directly to the funeral home ?
yes , thank you .
again , ma &apos;am , i &apos;m sorry for your loss .
oh , my god . i &apos;m rich !
again , ma &apos;am , i &apos;m sorry for your loss .
oh , i know .
i spent some of the best weeks of my life with frank .
but he &apos;s gone , there &apos;s nothing we can do about it ,
and i am a millionaire .
good . you can buy me a new couch .
i &apos;ll buy you whatever you want .
oh , i was kidding .
well , i wasn &apos;t . what do you need ? anyone .
i need a laptop for school .
done .
can i have a motorcycle ?
for school ?
kids , knock it off .
frank &apos;s body &apos;s not even in the van yet .
actually , it is .
i don &apos;t care . we &apos;re not talking about money right now .
a man died-- not a bank account--a man .
let &apos;s show a little respect .
we should probably figure out what to do about that bentley .
zach ?
anybody here ?
whoa , zach . zach , it &apos;s me !
sorry . it &apos;s , uh ...
it &apos;s a rough neighborhood .
you know how it is .
so ... two visits in one year .
what &apos;s up ?
hey , would you mind , uh , sitting down ? we need to talk .
do we ?
sure ... just ... a minute .
who you looking for , zach ? your father ?
paul came to see me .
he thinks you shot him . that true ?
okay . i shot him .
he ruined my life , but he gets to start his over .
it didn &apos;t seem right .
oh , god .
it was easy . i practiced it
in my head over and over again , and then ... bam !
showtime .
but then i got all paranoid
and i dumped the stupid gun at bree &apos;s .
i mean , i don &apos;t--i don &apos;t
know what i was thinking with that one .
i wasn &apos;t thinking .
yeah . that &apos;s the problem with being high .
you do things without thinking .
what ? i &apos;m not using drugs .
zach . i &apos;ve been there .
you need help . now we got to get you into rehab .
you want to send me to rehab ?
so what , so my father can come
and find me and take me to prison ?
no way .
i just want to get you some help .
it &apos;s too late for you to pretend to be my father .
you &apos;re right . but i still care .
then why did you let me go in the first place ?
you &apos;re the one who let me get raised by that monster .
no , that &apos;s not how things happened .
i don &apos;t care . i don &apos;t care .
let me help you--
just get out my house , all right ?
just get out of my house !
it &apos;s really nice of you to have me over .
are you kidding ? i am gonna be spending the rest
of my life thinking of ways to thank you . but as a start ...
oh . really ?
oh , come on . all right , let &apos;s ...
that is so sweet .
a crystal heart .
i looked for a crystal kidney-- surprisingly hard to find .
you know , in high school
i always dreamt you &apos;d give me your heart .
you know , speaking of high school ,
i , uh , have a present for you , too .
in addition to the one that &apos;s being ripped out of your body ?
i &apos;m sorry . that-- that was a little too vivid .
no , that &apos;s all right .
here , uh ... here you go .
oh ... what is this ?
it &apos;s just some memorabilia that i &apos;d thought you &apos;d enjoy .
some photos i took that
i didn &apos;t make the cut for the yearbook .
oh , my god .
there i am on the field hockey team ...
and in &quot; pippin . &quot;
these are great . who else do you have in here ?
oh , there &apos;s me on the debate club ...
and me at the spring formal ...
me in a bathing suit ...
taken through a fence .
not easy to get .
those bushes around your yard were really thick .
is this one of my old english papers ?
yeah . you threw it away , and i fished it out of the garbage .
that &apos;s also where i found this . uh ....
here .
my retainer ?
i would have returned it , but i was too scared to talk to you .
isn &apos;t it funny how we &apos;re talking now ?
yeah , really funny .
and now ...
we &apos;re gonna be bonded ...
you know ... forever .
you know , if you told me back in high school that one day
my kidney would be cleansing susan bremer &apos;s blood ,
i would have been the happiest guy on earth .
well , i &apos;m glad i could make that happen for you .
oh , my .
here
why don &apos;t you go see what &apos;s shaking at the malt shop ?
wow . thanks , grandma .
hey . what &apos;s all this ?
a little thank you for all the help you &apos;ve been
the last few days . open it , open it .
wow , it &apos;s beautiful .
mm @-@ hmm . 2200 bucks . didn &apos;t bat an eye .
that &apos;s a lot of money .
oh , there &apos;s more where that came from .
hey , why don &apos;t you and the whole fam @-@ damily
come to my house for dinner sunday night ?
i thought you were coming here sunday night .
i was gonna send one of the kids to pick you up .
nah . i think it &apos;s better you come to me .
oh , but sunday &apos;s a school night , and tom &apos;s got
an early meeting monday morning . how about saturday ?
nah . sunday .
oh , heads up--
dinners at the center are fancy . you &apos;ll have to squeeze
those boys of yours into some jackets and ties .
but , mom ... mom ... mom !
are you not listening ? it &apos;s not gonna work for us .
i would think you would want to make it work , lynette ...
given everything i &apos;m gonna be doing for the family .
are you blackmailing me ?
no ! i &apos;m inviting you to dinner .
if you can &apos;t make it , i can ask one of your sisters .
no , no , no , no , no . no , cover your man . come on .
hey , babe . game &apos;s almost over .
are you kidding me ?
you okay ?
i &apos;m sorry . i should have given this to you before .
why are you giving me a picture
of the kid from the pizza place ?
he &apos;s your son .
i still can &apos;t get over this .
you run into some random classmate from high school ,
and he &apos;s gonna end up saving your life ?
here &apos;s the part i can &apos;t get over .
you never put out for this guy ?
no . no , i barely remember him .
monroe is just doing this incredibly selfless act of charity .
it &apos;s inspiring .
what &apos;s this ?
uh ... n @-@ nothing . just put that away .
it &apos;s got your name on the cover in glitter .
no , it &apos;s just a gift from monroe . can i please have that ?
oh , my god .
yeah . you used to be cute . what happened ?
no , there &apos;s , like , a million pictures of you in here .
i guess he had a little crush on me .
crush ? no , susan .
this monroe guy &apos;s obsessed with you .
this is a shrine .
it is not .
it is . i know .
i &apos;ve made them . that &apos;s why i &apos;m not allowed
to mail things to ryan seacrest anymore .
it &apos;s creepy . it &apos;s like the part of the movie
when they go to the guy &apos;s basement and find the candles
in front of the picture
of the woman he &apos;s gonna kill .
you know ... those guys are often misunderstood .
and you &apos;re gonna take a kidney from this man ?
okay , i admit ,
i @-@ i &apos;m a little concerned ,
and , yes , he may be 5 % stalker .
is this a lock of your hair ?
10 % stalker .
but if i don &apos;t take his kidney , i could wait another six years .
why shouldn &apos;t i do it ?
because you &apos;ll be forever connected to him .
you &apos;ll never get rid of him .
and i have a feeling
that &apos;s not the only organ he wants to ... share with you .
carlos , can you feel my forehead ?
no .
i think i have a fever .
you &apos;re fine .
you didn &apos;t even feel !
&apos;cause i don &apos;t need to . liar .
no , i &apos;m really sick . let &apos;s reschedule .
i shouldn &apos;t see the therapist today .
we &apos;re going in .
what if i need to throw up ?
it &apos;s a therapist &apos;s office .
you &apos;re supposed to get it all out .
carlos--
you are going to therapy , and that &apos;s all there is to it .
fine . can i at least go to the bathroom first ?
you know i have a bladder the size of a dime .
how many years have we been married ?
too many , if you ask me !
where do you think you &apos;re going ?
i &apos;m going home .
no . gaby , you are sick . you need help .
look , you want me take pills , i will take them .
you want me to see a hypnotist ? bring him to the house .
hell , i &apos;ll even let you hire a priest to do an exorcism .
but what i am not going to do is talk to that woman in there .
why not ?
because she wants to talk about my childhood !
can i say one thing ?
you did find a way to talk about it before ... with me .
just that once . we had gotten married .
i thought you had a right to know .
and you said that you never wanted to talk about it again ,
and i have respected that .
but over the years , i have seen what it costs you .
the nights i hear you crying in the bathroom ...
sad look on your face when people ask about your past ...
you think that you &apos;ve left it behind , but you haven &apos;t , gaby .
you carry that burden around with you .
i just want you to consider the idea that
this therapist might be able to help you let all that go .
can you come with me ?
so when i lost grace ,
it tapped into this need i have to protect children .
where do you think this need came from ?
&apos;cause no one protected me .
when i was a child , my stepfather molested me .
get in .
why would i do that ?
i know where zach is .
are we driving to idaho ?
look , the reason i didn &apos;t tell you where he was before
is i didn &apos;t know what you wanted to do to him .
but whatever it is ,
it can &apos;t be worse than what he &apos;s doing to himself .
and why should i care about that after he tried to kill me ?
he &apos;s your son .
he &apos;s my son .
he needs our help .
hey , neighbor .
monroe . uh ...
what do you mean , &quot; neighbor &quot; ?
well , uh , your landlady &apos;s showing me an apartment .
i figured now that we &apos;re back in each other &apos;s lives ,
it would be better if i lived close .
yeah , uh ...
here &apos;s the thing about that .
there &apos;s close ...
and then there &apos;s glenn close .
this feels a little ...
stalky .
stalky ?
i @-@ i &apos;m giving you a kidney .
monroe , come with me .
the other day , when you were over here ,
i did not give you the full story .
this is mike .
he is my husband .
and this is our son m.j.
okay . why are you showing me this ?
because i want you to see that
there isn &apos;t room for anyone else in that picture .
don &apos;t get me wrong .
i am so grateful that you want to give me a kidney .
but once the operation is over , that has to be it .
why ?
because ...
you want to be more than friends , and i &apos;m married .
the tricky part is that ...
i still need a kidney ...
&apos;cause i want to stay healthy for ...
the two special guys in that picture .
so if you ...
still want to give me one ...
no strings attached ,
i will be honored to take it ...
and you will have my eternal gratitude .
yeah , but that &apos;s all i &apos;ll have .
what do you say ?
i can &apos;t .
i , uh ...
i thought if i did this , then ...
you would finally ...
i @-@ i know .
i know .
i @-@ i &apos;m so sorry .
don &apos;t be .
i &apos;ll be fine .
all right . i guess ... i &apos;ll--i &apos;ll see you around .
actually , i guess i won &apos;t .
we may think we &apos;ve left the past behind ,
but it has a way ...
of catching up to us .
though we want to run away ,
we are forced to confront our past ...
and the secrets that it buried ...
must come into the light .
and then , if we are strong ,
we are able to move on .
yes , we all need to leave the past behind
and move on toward the future .
and if we &apos;re lucky ,
