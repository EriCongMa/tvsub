bravo ! bravo !
bravo !
bravo !
bravo , manny ! bravo !
well , when i heard manny wanted to fence , i was , like ,
&quot; sure . uncoordinated kid , lethal weapon .
how can this go wrong ? &quot;
what do you think now ?
i &apos;m proud of our little zorro .
i mean i worked with him a little , but the kid &apos;s got skills .
it &apos;s in his blood . his father was a master swordsman .
he was an artist with his sword .
i mean , the way he throws the sword .
i mean , he was legendary .
you know this nice moment i &apos;m having with your son ?
you &apos;re kind of wrecking it .
sorry .
did you know that fencing goes back to the 12th century ?
you know what &apos;s even nerdier than fencing ?
knowing when it began .
i don &apos;t think you &apos;re a nerd , alex .
shut up , dork .
all right . that &apos;s my boy !
would this be easier ...
if we suspended you from a crane ?
any monkey can shoot a home movie .
i pride myself on shooting home films .
but , cameron , you always just take things a little too far .
no , i don &apos;t .
okay , your nephew &apos;s first birthday .
that &apos;s not fair .
you brought a wind machine .
to be fair ,
cameron ,
my vision was-
you brought a wind machine .
who puts wheels on cribs ?
ay ! sorry . sorry .
that &apos;s okay .
no . no , no , no , no ! my phone died .
no biggie . your battery probably just statically defracticated .
what ?
it means you can recharge it with static electricity .
just rub it on your hair .
yes !
you know , i used to go to the houses of my friends ,
i &apos;d see their kids &apos; trophies ,
and it used to bug me , you know ,
because there was never a trophy in my house .
not until this one .
oh , that &apos;s a good grip .
can we switch seats ?
cam , people are staring .
i know you &apos;re not supposed to care ,
but it &apos;s kind of cool to have a kid in your house
who &apos;s the best at something .
you know what i mean ?
yeah , our kids are great .
they &apos;re the greatest .
gosh , we &apos;re blessed .
we are . but , um ,
are they the best at something ?
i &apos;d have to think about that .
well , alex is great at every single thing she tries ,
so , you know , she &apos;ll find her specialty .
she will .
and haley is-
haley is so pretty .
gorgeous , gorgeous girl .
oh , gosh .
so she can meet someone who &apos;s the best at something .
that &apos;s right .
and then , uh , i guess that leaves luke .
we dropped the ball a little bit on that one .
yeah , a little bit .
第一季第七集
bravo !
how about a nice round of applause for our winner , manny delgado .
manny now moves on to the championship ,
where he &apos;ll be competing against caroline markum .
we &apos;ll see you all back here at 4 : 30 .
all right .
bravo .
what she said .
wow . this means more to dad than it does to manny .
yeah , it &apos;s his chance to be father of a champion .
well , second chance .
we all know how the first time went .
did i say something wrong ?
no , no . i &apos;m- i &apos;m very happy for manny.that &apos;s all .
everything &apos;s always about claire . geez .
i wanna thank you guys for coming by and supporting the kid .
you guys are the best !
why , claire ?
really ?
that took a while .
she &apos;s been asleep for 20 minutes .
it just took me some time to sneak out without waking her up .
kind of like the first time you slept over here .
i had a meeting .
all right . let &apos;s talk about why you got your panties in a bunch .
what &apos;s up with you and your sister ?
nothing is up .
mm @-@ hmm .
or could this have something to do with ... ice skating ?
when mitchell and claire were kids .
this is interesting to no one .
excuse , please . let me finish . thank you .
when mitchell was 10
eleven .
and claire was 13 , they
were competitive ice dancers .
figure skaters !
oh , for god &apos;s sakes , i &apos;ll tell the story . yes ,
my sister and i were actually a very good team .
we were called &quot; fire and nice . &quot;
i was fire , because of the red hair , and claire was nice ,
because it was ironic and she wasn &apos;t .
and mitchell is still upset
because claire quit the team right before some meet .
&quot; some meet . &quot; the 13 @-@ and @-@ under regional championships .
just the emerald city at the end of my yellow brick road .
wow . you did it .
what ?
you made figure skating sound even gayer .
so , seeing your dad so proud of manny ...
didn &apos;t stir up any resentment ?
mm @-@ mmm .
oh .
okay , fine . you always do this .
instead of letting your feelings out , you bury them ,
and then they bubble up later in hurtful ways .
okay , you know what ? yes . all right , listen .
i might still be holding a little resentment ,
but that &apos;s ... embarrassing and petty
and it &apos;s not a good color on me .
it &apos;s kind of like you and yellow .
you love me in my yellow shirt .
it makes you look like the sun .
bubbling . hurtful bubbling .
now you know why i left early that morning .
i knew you didn &apos;t have a meeting , cam . i knew it .
there must be something wrong with this phone .
i &apos;ve rubbed it on my head for , like , an hour .
what ? alex .
oh , you &apos;re such a geek .
at least i didn &apos;t give myself a bald spot .
oh , my god ! mom !
alex , don &apos;t be mean .
haley , stop making yourself such an easy target .
this feels right , buddy . i &apos;m telling you , this feels right .
what are you guys doing ?
pursuing excellence .
we make a list of areas the boy might excel at
and ... baseball .
love it .
yeah . i read it only takes 10,000 hours to achieve excellence .
you &apos;ve already got , what , how many hours playing ball ?
well , i played , like , one season , so , like , 6,000 hours ?
yeah . i can see why you ruled out math .
yeah , of course i want luke to be successful .
but i don &apos;t think that a parent can just force that .
i think you just have to have
faith that the kid &apos;s gonna find his own way .
besides , luke already is the best at something- being my son .
it sounded a lot less lame in my head .
i have got a good feeling about this .
this is gonna be your sport .
last year , you said basketball was my sport .
look , i &apos;ve said a lot of things i wish i could take back but i can &apos;t .
what i can do ...
is be the dad you need me to be to help you become masterful .
you wanna be masterful ?
i guess .
there &apos;s my killer ! okay .
our journey of 10,000 hours ...
begins with a single pitch .
i believe in my boy .
i ain &apos;t gonna quit you .
let &apos;s burn one in here .
that &apos;s good . that &apos;s a good start .
okay , you rest that cannon while i run this down , okay ?
okay , let &apos;s keep all the batters right here .
oh , should &apos;ve- should &apos;ve worn my cup . should &apos;ve worn my cup .
home run !
this one &apos;s really in here , buddy .
okay . very , very , very , very good first hour .
toss me your glove . i &apos;ll put some oil on it .
everything okay ?
yes .
i was telling my grandmother how great was manny today .
so that wasn &apos;t angry talk ?
no , silly . that was happy talk .
i &apos;m beginning to understand
why there &apos;s so much conflict on your continent .
here . check this out .
ah , jay .
jay loves to make t @-@ shirts for special occasions .
come on , baby . show them .
a few years back , my granddaughter haley ran a 5k ,
so i had a few of these made up .
it &apos;s just fun .
i love it when you &apos;re so proud of manny .
you know , i &apos;m not gonna lie .
seeing him out there slicing those kids to pieces ,
you know , it gets to ya .
gracias , mi amor .
i &apos;m sorry to interrupt .
it &apos;s okay , papi .
hey , champ ! i got a little something for you .
and i have something for you . here .
i will not be needing it anymore .
but the finals ?
i am retired .
wait , wait , wait .
you can &apos;t retire .
it &apos;s just not fun anymore .
well , that &apos;s probably just butterflies .
come on . you &apos;re gonna be fine .
look , if he doesn &apos;t want to , it &apos;s his decision .
ah , the hell it is .
he shouldn &apos;t be doing anything that makes him nervous .
papi , i support you .
i &apos;m not nervous . i just don &apos;t want to fight a girl .
what ?
defeating a woman will be a mark on my honor .
why ?
because men are always so superior to woman ?
so superior that you cannot even finish your sentence ?
dude .
manny , you always call yourself the lover of women ,
but if you don &apos;t compete with this girl ,
you &apos;re showing me and all the woman that you don &apos;t respect us .
i &apos;m sorry .
okay , so , take back your sword ...
and go fight this girl like a bull .
okay .
can &apos;t hear you !
okay !
i can &apos;t hear you !
that &apos;s really as loud as i can go .
what does it take to make a great salesman ?
it &apos;s no big secret .
you just follow the abc &apos;s of salesmanship : always be closing .
don &apos;t ever forget
great home ideas just keep lurking , mostly nearby .
often people question realtors &apos; sincerity .
take umbrage . violators will-
oh , shoot . x- x-
and this is the great room ,
although &quot; great &quot; hardly seems to do a room like this justice .
weird , squiggly painting not included .
i actually love it .
i do too .
it &apos;s really beautiful .
um , all custom built @-@ ins , and you will notice just-
just tons of natural light , so that &apos;s great .
did i need the sale ? yes .
was i worried ? no .
why ? because . because why ?
because i won &apos;t sell anything i don &apos;t believe in .
and when i believe , you believe .
i could sell a fur coat to an eskimo .
yeah , phil , i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s a beautiful house .
but i &apos;m just not sure how kid @-@ friendly it is ,
and we have two small children .
i mean , these stairs alone .
dad , this place is awesome .
not now , luke .
did you see the backyard ?
it &apos;s got room for 10 tree houses .
and the bedroom &apos;s got a window on the ceiling .
i wish we could live here .
i wish you &apos;d go back out to the patio where-
do you really ?
oh , yeah . our house sucks compared to this one .
it really does .
there you are .
i &apos;m gonna get changed and
then we &apos;ll go back to manny &apos;s match , okay ?
dad doesn &apos;t want me to go .
what ? why ?
remember when you were all worried that our son &apos;s a dud ?
okay . that &apos;s not exactly the way i remember it .
turns out he &apos;s a natural .
at what ?
at selling .
hey , titans of residential real estate .
that &apos;s right , i &apos;m talking to you ,
sandy brewster , skip woosnum , j.j. mccubbin .
hear those footsteps ? that &apos;s luke dunphy ,
and he &apos;s gonna drink your milk shake .
that &apos;s amazing .
right ?
incredible .
so , the buyer &apos;s coming back
in an hour with her husband , and i need him .
i am telling you , that kid is a genius .
there &apos;s the rainmaker .
why is your ipod in your mouth ?
i &apos;m charging it .
alex . alex !
so , there &apos;s no part of you
that wants to clear the air with your sister ?
nope .
okay , fine . that &apos;s your family &apos;s way . i &apos;ll respect that .
but you should know , it &apos;s hard on the people who love you .
cam
we feel the tension .
we hear the words that cut like knives .
hey , guys ! i brought orange slices .
okay , you know what ? i can &apos;t bear this .
claire , mitchell still resents you
for quitting the figure skating team when you were kids .
ladies , come inside with me , please .
work it out . come on .
thanks , cam .
is he serious ?
is that what your little jab was about this morning ?
okay . no . yes . okay , yes . yes .
i guess i &apos;m still a little angry .
but , you know , you stole my moment , claire .
yeah , 21 years ago .
okay , but it doesn &apos;t matter to you ...
because you had your own moments .
you had cheerleading and high school plays
and making out with the quarterback .
oh come on , you made out with him too .
yeah , but we had to keep it a secret .
you shouldn &apos;t have quit .
it was selfish .
you wanna know why i quit ?
i quit to protect you .
from what ?
glory ? fame ? press conferences ?
what ? come on . i was bigger than you .
i was bigger than you ,
and i was afraid you wouldn &apos;t be able to lift me .
you were dropping me in practice ,
and i didn &apos;t want you to
i dropped you twice .
three times .
humiliate yourself in front of all those people .
you dropped me all the time .
come on . could you just forgive me and move on ?
of course . yes , yes . yes , of- i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry .
oh . this must seem so petty , huh ?
well , it &apos;s a little silly , but we all have our thing , don &apos;t we ?
i &apos;m just glad you &apos;re getting it out of you .
are you trying to lift me ? you are . you &apos;re trying to lift me . oh !
stay focused , stay loose and stay angry .
who &apos;s the toughest ?
i am .
who &apos;s the bravest ?
i am .
who &apos;s the baddest ?
can you guys ask all the questions now
so i don &apos;t have to keep lifting this ?
go .
go get &apos; em !
there we go . you all set ?
yeah .
okay , go get &apos; em . good luck .
excuse me . is this seat taken ?
no . sit .
oh , thank you .
oh , is manny yours ?
yes .
oh , he &apos;s quite good . i saw him earlier .
thank you .
is she your little girl ?
oh , caroline ? no . no .
sadly , her parents passed away .
i &apos;m her nurse down at the children &apos;s hospital .
but all of my patients are like family to me .
well , our boys are enjoying themselves .
yeah . i can talk about
crown moldings and recessed lighting until the cows come home ,
but nothing compares with that sound right there .
oh . hey , buddy . oh , he &apos;s fine .
my foot . i think it &apos;s backwards .
it &apos;s not backwards .
wh @-@ what happened ?
it &apos;s the stupid floors ! they &apos;re too slippery .
oak . also known as nature &apos;s pillow .
it &apos;s like ice .
now , let &apos;s not start blaming the floors .
you shouldn &apos;t have been running .
i saw a ghost .
ghosts . hey , phil dunphy . okay , that &apos;s me .
that &apos;s acting like a natural shoehorn .
okay . probably better all take
our shoes off for this part of the tour . follow me .
she &apos;s our little miracle .
oh . i only wish her father had made it back
from afghanistan to see this .
oh , there &apos;s our cheering section .
over here , you guys .
oh , my god . we have to stop him .
maybe i can pull the fire alarm .
expect no mercy .
bring it on , big boy .
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m glad dad &apos;s proud of manny . i am .
i just- it would have been nice to see him that proud of us .
by us , i mean me .
and you sincerely thought that the path to dad &apos;s approval ...
was going to be through figure skating ?
mitchell , i am fairly confident that dad &apos;s proudest moment ...
was when you finally took off the flame @-@ red unitard .
i am not claiming that any of this is rational .
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry for being such a pill , okay ?
um , actually , i always felt very guilty for quitting .
i know how much you loved figure skating .
i never really loved skating .
uh , what ?
um , all right , this is gonna sound a little gay .
but , um , when @-@ when you and i skated together ,
you weren &apos;t the mean older sister
and i wasn &apos;t the clingy little brother .
we were- we were a team , and-
well , let &apos;s face it ,
we &apos;ve kind of grown apart in the past few years .
and with mom and dad &apos;s divorce , we were on opposing sides .
and i- i just- i miss being on your team .
that &apos;s ...
a little gay .
there we go .
claire , where are you going ?
claire ?
no way .
get up .
really ?
mm @-@ m
don &apos;t drop me .
put it away or lose it .
somebody &apos;s got to put a stop to this .
that &apos;s it , mitchell .
so , can we take you and caroline out for ice cream ?
we can &apos;t . she &apos;s diabetic .
of course she is .
a round of applause for our winner , manny delgado .
let &apos;s get out of here . get this thing in the trunk .
i can &apos;t decide if i &apos;m feeling more proud or mortified .
how about now ?
we tell our kids it doesn &apos;t matter if you win or lose ,
but let &apos;s be honest .
winning feels pretty great .
there &apos;s nothing like that golden moment in the sun .
i think every parent probably wants that for their child .
and maybe a little bit for ourselves too .
sometimes we push too hard .
and that leads to a lot of resentment and guilt .
yes ! yes !
so , how much is too much ? here &apos;s where i come out .
guilt fades .
hardware is forever .
you &apos;re mad , aren &apos;t you ?
i &apos;m not mad .
yes , you are .
no , i &apos;m not .
you &apos;re a little jealous .
i &apos;m happy for the two of you .
all right , come on . we &apos;ll do one . stay there .
for real ?
yep .
feel better ?
yeah . oh , do me now . come on .
what are you talking about ?
are you serious ?
cam , no .
