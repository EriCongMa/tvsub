as you &apos;re aware ,
matthew keller pled down to manslaughter
after you two brought him in for murder .
yeah .
his sentencing was this week .
yeah , he got 20 years at barksdale .
yesterday , he contacted the department of justice .
he says he has information critical to national security .
his sentencing didn &apos;t go well . now he wants a deal .
probably .
but we do that sometimes , caffrey .
we make deals with con men .
what did homeland security say ?
keller wouldn &apos;t talk to them .
he insisted he would only talk to you .
neal &apos;s right .
i seriously doubt he has any real information .
there &apos;s no harm checking it out .
go talk to him .
who is this guy ?
he &apos;s an old rival of neal &apos;s .
they were baccarat partners in morocco .
uh , backgammon in monaco .
close .
and we were never partners .
mm , a contemporary of neal &apos;s -- this i got to see .
no , he &apos;s not what you &apos;d expect .
a little more ratso rizzo than cary grant .
i &apos;m cary grant ?
only by comparison to ratso rizzo .
agent burke and mr. neal caffrey .
thanks for coming , gents . i appreciate it .
thank you , o &apos;donnell .
you &apos;re doing all right for yourself , keller .
eh , meager touches , but i get by .
dominican rolled .
the , uh , tobacco is infused with louis xiii cognac .
they &apos;re delicious . please .
you have information for us ?
i understand . you &apos;re on the job .
how about you , neal , huh ?
is this business or pleasure ?
it &apos;s always a pleasure seeing you behind bars .
well , we &apos;re all in prison of sorts , aren &apos;t we ?
it &apos;s the life we make out of it that matters .
i mean , you &apos;ve made the most out of your prison sentence ,
working for the feds .
i think i &apos;d like to do the same .
what do you want , keller ?
new game , caffrey ?
there it is .
i feel like i &apos;ve made a home for myself here , you know ?
i &apos;ve nested .
and now they want to move me
somewhere less welcoming .
yeah . barksdale supermax .
don &apos;t think they chill the port there .
no , you &apos;re right .
yeah , inmates don &apos;t realize
that a white port should be lightly chilled .
you &apos;re a skilled people person .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll be fine .
i don &apos;t know . a lot of russian mob at barksdale .
that &apos;s right . you have a problem with them .
a seven @-@ figure debt , as i recall .
and there &apos;s another reason why i want to stay here ...
which brings me to my proposal .
are you familiar with the term &quot; pis aller &quot; ?
my french is a little rusty .
it &apos;s a move of last resort ...
... something you do when you &apos;re out of options .
yeah .
now , if i had information of a maker of forged passports ,
i imagine that would be of value .
what are you looking for in exchange ?
i &apos;d like to stay here .
no .
relax , neal , all right ?
it &apos;s not like i &apos;m asking
to be let loose on the streets of new york
with only an anklet to control my compulsions .
and i am hoping , agent burke ,
that this could lead to an ongoing relationship
between you , me , and the bureau .
you &apos;re already scheduled to be transferred , keller .
we &apos;re pretty late in the process .
that &apos;s why i asked for you .
these are perfect passports -- caffrey quality --
just the thing for terrorists and smugglers .
no promises , but if your information pans out ,
i &apos;ll see what i can do .
i appreciate your candor .
i can see why neal trusts you .
the guy &apos;s name is jason lang .
look him up .
okay , neal .
time to go .
&quot; pis aller ... &quot;
can also mean the worst thing that can happen .
we &apos;re both running out of options , caffrey .
it &apos;s your move .
satchmo .
el ? have you seen my jacket -- the blue pinstripe ?
yeah , i &apos;ve -- i &apos;ve got it . - okay .
is it this one ?
yeah .
you have a meeting today .
i was supposed to pick up the dry cleaning last night .
i am so sorry .
honey , it &apos;s okay . i got it .
wait .
wait a minute . you never called to remind me .
did you assume i &apos;d forget ?
i know you had a lot on your mind .
yeah , but i don &apos;t want to be the husband
that forgets to pick up the dry cleaning .
that &apos;s sweet .
but i am .
relax , okay ? i &apos;m not mad .
yes , you are , and you &apos;re gonna hold onto it all day .
really ? would i really do that ?
no . never .
okay , you &apos;re the one who forgot the dry cleaning .
see ?
now you scared the dog .
oh , add that to my list of imperfections .
okay , look , i don &apos;t want to be the wife
that has to call and nag you to do things .
and plus , it &apos;s -- it &apos;s a lot more effort to try and remind you ,
and i don &apos;t even know if you &apos;re gonna remember .
i &apos;m sorry .
i didn &apos;t realize i was such a foregone conclusion .
neither did i. can we stop this ?
yes . please .
okay , i &apos;ve got to go to work .
me too .
have a wonderful day .
you too .
yeah , that could have gone better .
you didn &apos;t help .
so , what do you think keller wants ?
well , he &apos;s set up like a king at hawthorne fed --
smoking gurkhas , sipping port , reading the times .
as much as i loathe schadenfreude ,
it would be nice to know that keller &apos;s suffering .
well , if they send him to barksdale ,
the russians will take care of that .
well , can you trust the suit
to not keep him at hawthorne ?
his transfer &apos;s later today .
and you &apos;re heading to the office
to check out what keller told you ?
he &apos;s desperate . this is his last play .
what about ... kate ?
what about her ?
well , keller &apos;s used her to provoke you before .
he may do it again .
keller can bring up kate , he can offer peter deals ,
he can even beat me at chess --
he &apos;s winning the chess game ?
no .
but my point --
forged passports won &apos;t stop the transfer ,
and i &apos;ve moved past kate .
i have , moz .
clearly .
look , she &apos;ll always be a part of me , but ...
i have to move on .
okay .
hey . what &apos;s going on ?
hey . i figured out keller &apos;s game .
he wants us to investigate this jason lang ,
forger @-@ turned @-@ photographer on the lower east side .
so he said .
yeah , but here &apos;s where it gets good .
keller and lang were suspected of working together
on the bellmont bond forgeries three years ago .
they were partners ?
yeah , but it went south ,
and keller took two bullets .
from lang &apos;s gun .
i spoke to the case agent .
he said that their partnership dissolved
and lang destroyed the bonds .
keller &apos;s going for a trifecta --
take out the man who shot him ,
secure his stay in a federal hotel room ,
and tweak me in the process .
next case .
yeah , not so fast .
hughes still wants us to find out
if lang is making phony passports .
oh , don &apos;t tell me we have to make a deal with keller .
oh , relax , we &apos;re not gonna release keller on an anklet ...
unless june has a spare bedroom .
oh , that &apos;s not funny .
no , you &apos;re right .
you &apos;re nothing like keller .
&apos;cause he &apos;s a killer .
well , there &apos;s that , and he had cigars in his cell .
i remember your prison cell -- no cigars .
when you &apos;re done , i &apos;d like to go visit lang &apos;s studio .
all right , i &apos;m just saying , you know ,
he had a tiffany lamp --
so did my mom .
what &apos;s going on ?
nothing .
oh , come on .
your sarcasm goes up in
direct proportion to your stress level .
it &apos;s elizabeth .
i forgot to pick up the dry cleaning .
well , it happens .
apparently , all the time .
i &apos;ve become the guy who forgets to do it so often
that she had to pick it up
without even asking me if i got it .
she was angry ?
no .
and that &apos;s bad ?
yes .
i &apos;m a constant disappointment .
she said that ?
implied .
maybe she finds your forgetfulness endearing .
i don &apos;t want her to find my forgetfulness endearing .
and the worst part is , when she left this morning ,
i didn &apos;t call her &quot; hon. &quot;
have you ever seen an actual fight ? because --
it &apos;s our own little abbreviation for saying , &quot; i love you . &quot;
when we first got married ,
i used to say , &quot; i love you , honey . &quot;
then it became , &quot; love you , honey , &quot;
then &quot; honey . &quot;
now all we need to say is , &quot; hon. &quot;
very efficient .
point is , i didn &apos;t say it .
look , call her , leave her a voice mail ,
and say &quot; hon &quot; before you hang up .
did i miss anything ?
no . i &apos;ll call her as soon as we &apos;re done here .
okay .
hi . peter burke , fbi .
would you mind getting us jason lang ?
thank you .
jason lang ?
keep your chin down .
keep your eyes down .
fbi .
we received information that your studio may be involved
in the production of passport forgeries .
who told you that ?
your record .
you were convicted of forgery in the past .
well , that was 10 years ago , you know ?
just take a look at my price list .
i think you &apos;ll see that
i really have no use for an illegal side business .
oh , come on . take a break .
will you excuse me ?
certainly .
this is jason .
i don &apos;t like this guy . what do you think ?
truesdale color @-@ shifting printer .
mm , that &apos;d be an important tool
in making color @-@ shifting images in the u.s. passport .
so would the metrolux 5200,
which is only used for one purpose .
making holographic images .
also found in u.s. passports .
it &apos;s a nice cover .
he integrates holograms into his artwork .
is this enough to bring him in ?
it &apos;s enough for us to get a warrant .
hey ... lang .
i need to talk to you about your equipment here .
lang ! hey ! la--
i &apos;ll follow . stay here .
okay .
lang ?
this was a setup .
drop your weapon and your cell and get in the van .
peter !
hello ?
you lost a key piece , caffrey .
god damn it , keller , this isn &apos;t a game !
of course it is . life is a game .
if you stop playing , peter burke will die .
hey , check the doors upstairs .
you &apos;re working with keller .
what makes you say that ?
keller turned us on to you ,
so , obviously , you made a deal with him .
he &apos;s going to betray you .
well , why don &apos;t you let me deal with keller ,
and -- and you worry about yourself ?
i &apos;m not worried .
hmm , you should be .
nah , you should be .
you kidnapped a federal agent .
you &apos;re gonna have the full might of the u.s. government
closing around your neck .
time to shut up .
here &apos;s what i already know .
we made a left on houston ,
then made a wide right about a minute later ,
driving straight for about eight minutes or so
in stop @-@ and @-@ go traffic .
we &apos;re in the garment district ,
8th or 9th avenue and about 38th street .
you &apos;re not wearing a mask , and i &apos;m not dead ,
so you still need me for something .
before this goes any further , let &apos;s work something out .
you know , i &apos;ve gone down that road before ,
and i trust you less than i trust keller .
i don &apos;t know who you &apos;ve dealt with in the past ,
but i keep my word .
you know , every few months ,
a different agent comes by , investigating a different crime ,
and he tells me that if i don &apos;t cooperate ,
he &apos;s gonna make my life a living hell .
and he does .
i can help you with that .
how ?
i mean , you can &apos;t stop the bureau from playing politics .
it just never ends .
look , whatever you &apos;re planning ,
keller has something else in mind .
you are gonna wind up dead or in prison
unless we work something out .
no more deals .
okay ?
you should better protect your king .
where &apos;s peter ? !
it &apos;s stuffy in here .
let &apos;s go for a walk .
i know you won &apos;t think twice about killing him ,
so i haven &apos;t told the fbi .
it &apos;s best not to discuss personal matters
with everybody , neal .
well , they &apos;re gonna find out soon enough .
you seem upset , caffrey . you know ?
i mean , clearly , you &apos;re dealing with a big problem here ,
and i wish i could help , but i got problems , too .
see , since burke didn &apos;t stop my transfer ,
they &apos;re shipping me off to barksdale later today .
now , my sources tell me that i , too , face dire circumstances
unless my debts with the russians gets paid .
how much do you owe them ?
$ 2.5 million .
once my problem goes away , then --
maybe then , i can help you with yours .
i don &apos;t have $ 2.5 million .
neal , how long have we known each other ?
everything is gone , keller .
i &apos;ve had to use my resources
since my current activities are a little limited .
it &apos;s true . you do have expensive tastes .
but i recall a night in scotland
when you acquired something worth that amount .
that was six years ago .
i &apos;m fairly certain you held onto it .
i didn &apos;t . i didn &apos;t have any use for it .
well , i do .
so find it .
you got three hours till my transfer .
we &apos;ll be in touch .
you &apos;re gonna lose , keller .
again .
pis aller .
my move of last resort , neal .
hey , neal . if you &apos;re looking for peter , he &apos;s not here .
yeah , i know . diana , we got a problem .
keller and lang worked out some kind of deal .
peter &apos;s been taken .
listen up -- one of our own &apos;s been kidnapped .
now , graham , i want you to coordinate
eastern and southern districts .
jones , i want you with keller &apos;s transfer convoy .
campanelli , i want wiretaps within the next two hours
on every cell , home , prison , and business
linked to keller and lang .
under no circumstances does anyone talk to the press .
this is 24 @-@ 7 till we find him .
all right , let &apos;s do it .
what did keller tell you at the prison ?
he wants $ 2.5 million in exchange for peter .
but keller doesn &apos;t have peter .
keller &apos;s behind bars .
he &apos;s running this .
he called me on peter &apos;s cell
right when lang drove away with him .
ert is analyzing the phone
and we put out an apb on the van .
why does keller want that kind of money ?
he &apos;s doing 20 years .
he needs it to pay off the russian mob
so they don &apos;t kill him when he arrives at barksdale .
the fbi doesn &apos;t negotiate -- period --
particularly with someone who &apos;s already locked up
and fearing for his life .
sir , all due respect -- keller doesn &apos;t bluff .
he will kill peter if i don &apos;t engage him .
the reason no one takes our men is because we make it clear
all hell will rain down on them if they do .
you also have to be willing to sacrifice a few of your agents
to prove your point .
this isn &apos;t a one @-@ man con , neal .
this is the u.s. government .
we will catch lang ,
and we will string keller up by his thumbs
until he cries for forgiveness .
protocol dictates we lock keller down
till this is all over ,
but that gives him exactly what he wants --
to stay at hawthorne indefinitely .
you &apos;ve already contacted the prison ?
we &apos;re sending his ass to barksdale supermax .
come sundown , keller &apos;s gonna be bunking
with a 7 @-@ foot russian named ivan .
diana , you stay with neal .
listen , caffrey ...
let us do our job . we &apos;ll bring peter home safely .
would you give us a minute ?
sure .
thank you .
moz , what &apos;s up ?
i got a call from an unidentifiable voice
from an unknown number .
gave me a time and a place for a meeting .
told me to tell you .
is this your little friend keller ?
all right , meet me at madison square park in half an hour .
you got it .
oh , and bring a hammer .
uh , ball @-@ peen or claw ?
ball @-@ peen or claw ?
surprise me .
neal , what &apos;s going on ?
keller kidnapped peter . got to go .
w @-@ wait , w @-@ what ? !
elizabeth .
every agent in the bureau has one goal right now --
to find your husband .
i know . thank you , reese .
we &apos;re going to post a team at your home
in case he makes contact .
just , uh , give us a few minutes ,
and i &apos;ll have them take you back .
okay .
they , um ...
they say this is the biggest manhunt
the fbi has run in a decade .
even i &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
what do you know about keller ?
he &apos;s a chess player .
he thinks 10 , 12 moves ahead .
so everything they &apos;re doing --
all the helicopters and the agents knocking on doors ?
he would have foreseen that .
they don &apos;t know his end game .
no .
what are you doing ?
well , they want me to go home ...
sit tight .
but is that what you &apos;re gonna do ?
what do you want me to do ?
whatever it takes to bring him home .
i &apos;m supposed to be escorting you home .
i need to meet up with a friend first .
i hope you &apos;re not planning on making a side deal with keller .
look , diana , if this were any other kidnapper --
rule one -- never let someone emotionally involved
do the negotiating .
yeah , if you &apos;re willing to lose your hostage .
i &apos;ve read the fbi playbook . so has keller .
well , why do you think he &apos;s so different ?
early in his career , keller pulled a 3 @-@ man job .
the game was pretty straightforward ,
and nobody got hurt .
but while they &apos;re walking away from the site ,
the third man says he thinks he left his passport behind .
while he &apos;s checking his pockets ,
keller put a bullet in his head .
the guy &apos;s passport was in his back pocket the whole time .
keller didn &apos;t wait to find out .
you were the second man ?
if i can engage him , i can make sure peter &apos;s alive
and figure out a lead .
i can &apos;t endorse what you &apos;re doing .
what do you think peter would let me do ?
all right , i &apos;m gonna go get a cup of coffee .
i &apos;ll meet you here in ...
one hour .
here .
here .
so , you ditched big brother ?
&quot; brother &quot; ?
big sister .
yeah , she &apos;s not gonna follow us .
what &apos;s with the sack of hammers ? i said bring one .
you said to surprise you .
moz !
you &apos;re worried about peter .
i happen to have an arsenal of hammers .
look , you &apos;ve got half an hour before the exchange .
unless keller &apos;s developed a hammer fetish ,
i imagine we &apos;re smashing something ?
recognize this spot ?
i once met a man in this park who claimed to be john lennon ,
and i believed him .
the year was 1991 . mm .
it &apos;s where kate and i used to come .
i used to think one day
our kids would play on that playground .
i didn &apos;t know you thought about kids .
i thought we &apos;d grow old here .
you were gonna propose ?
i had the whole thing worked out , moz .
remember that street violinist ?
caesar .
i had him learn &quot; everybody loves somebody . &quot;
he was gonna spontaneously break into it when we passed .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
would you have approved ?
perhaps not .
but the name &quot; uncle mozzie &quot;
does have a certain je ne sais quoi .
i assume you acquired a ring ?
yeah .
i figured it was safer to leave it here
than in a safety deposit box when i was in prison .
well , any idiot can rob a bank .
that &apos;s the mcnally solitaire .
that &apos;s worth at least two --
and a half million at the last appraisal .
i thought we had depleted your resources .
i guess i was still holding out .
for what ?
hope ...
that she wan &apos;t gone .
well , fate has a way of putting in front of us
that which we most try to leave behind .
dostoevsky ?
no , me during my blue period .
are you really willing to give that up for the suit ?
keeping peter alive is more important
than holding a candle for someone who isn &apos;t .
you should stay hydrated .
caffrey &apos;s on his way to the exchange .
okay .
did you check in with ridgefield ?
yeah .
the transfer &apos;s in motion .
okay , all right . terrific .
well , you stay here , all right ?
don &apos;t talk to him . don &apos;t let him talk to you .
and , uh ...
don &apos;t take your eyes off him . that &apos;s nice .
lang , did i hear you mention ridgefield ?
keep your mouth shut .
ridgefield , the private security firm
that the government &apos;s contracted out to transfer prisoners ?
could be . or maybe i have a cousin elmo ridgefield .
sounds to me like you &apos;re helping keller escape
during his transfer .
you &apos;re meeting neal for an exchange .
so , you &apos;re using whatever he gives you to buy off ridgefield ,
and they &apos;re gonna let keller escape during the transfer .
you are a smart guy . you know what ?
i genuinely like watching you work .
so , you probably also picked up on the fact
that i don &apos;t care if you heard us .
which means you don &apos;t intend to let me go .
you intend to kill me .
no .
no , i don &apos;t intend to kill you .
no , keller does --
once he &apos;s free .
keep an eye on our friend .
um , i &apos;m selling magazines .
uh , suit quarterly , anyone ?
no ? clearly , i have the wrong house .
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s -- it &apos;s okay . he &apos;s -- he &apos;s a friend .
we can talk on the patio .
did neal send you ?
no .
i came of my own volition .
look , i don &apos;t know anything , and it &apos;s killing me .
listen , i don &apos;t usually give these guys much credit ,
but between them and neal ,
peter &apos;s gonna be home in time for dinner tonight .
you know that ?
moz , what you know ?
neal &apos;s meeting with the bad guys right now to strike a deal .
he &apos;s also giving them what they want
to ensure your husband &apos;s safe return .
peter and i had a fight this morning .
i &apos;m sure it was nothing .
no , there &apos;s never small fights . it &apos;s --
you don &apos;t resolve them , they fester .
and this is the first morning that we didn &apos;t .
i thought he would have loved
that i piked up the dry cleaning .
seriously ? this is about dry cleaning ?
i @-@ i &apos;m sorry .
the longest relationship i &apos;ve had is 11 days .
and then she deflated .
i &apos;m kidding . go on .
the last thing i said to him was , &quot; have a wonderful day . &quot;
now , i &apos;m guessing , in a fight about dry cleaning ,
that that &apos;s pretty severe .
we &apos;re not like most couples , moz .
we work .
i don &apos;t want to lose him .
look , i understand how hard this is ,
particularly when the suits won &apos;t tell you anything .
that &apos;s why i want you to have this .
i &apos;m gonna drop a bug in there
so you can hear what they hear ...
when they hear it .
thank you .
oh , wow ! i have a set of these .
oh , wait . no .
these aren &apos;t russian military surplus .
where &apos;s peter ?
he &apos;s safe .
may i see the item ?
nope .
i see peter , you see the ring .
those aren &apos;t the terms .
i didn &apos;t agree to any terms .
first we &apos;ll have the ring authenticated
and delivered to the russians ,
and then we &apos;ll release burke .
you &apos;ll get it when i have proof that peter &apos;s alive .
are you willing to let your agent die ?
are you willing to let keller down ?
all right .
caffrey ...
we &apos;re gonna show mr. caffrey proof of life .
you can ask one question .
i &apos;m going to text it to burke ,
and he &apos;s going to text the answer back .
i want to speak with him .
one question . make it a good one .
what cellphone number was caffrey using
the first time you caught him ?
that &apos;s the question ?
let me see it .
wait . i don &apos;t have my glasses . bring it closer .
you &apos;re lucky your buddy &apos;s paying up ,
or my friends would be sending me
a very different message right now .
give me a break . it &apos;s been a few years .
okay .
area code 668 ...
7337 .
is that correct ?
that &apos;s right .
great .
the ring ?
you &apos;re not gonna authenticate it ?
if it &apos;s not real ,
you &apos;ll just never see burke again .
100 bucks . you can &apos;t beat that .
thanks .
sure .
do you mind ?
let me get this straight --
you gave them a multimillion @-@ dollar ring ,
and they still have peter ?
i admit the terms weren &apos;t favorable .
you think ?
what &apos;s the fbi found so far ?
oh , that &apos;s right .
i &apos;ve got proof of life and a message .
how do you even have access to a multimillion @-@ dollar ring ?
oh , that &apos;s for another time .
i asked peter for the phone number i used
when i was first arrested .
what , and you didn &apos;t have one ?
actually , i had several ,
but i was hoping he &apos;d take the opportunity
to pass me a 10 @-@ letter message using the keypad .
he told us something .
a cross street , a location , a warning ?
not pam sees ?
does he know any blind pams ?
no .
&quot; onus border . &quot;
worthy of the times sunday edition ,
but it means nothing to me .
&quot; no tram seeps . &quot;
&quot; not ram reds . &quot;
got it .
&quot; no transfer . &quot;
that &apos;s got to be it .
peter wants us to stop keller &apos;s transfer .
it &apos;s in progress . jones is with them .
diana .
jones , we made contact with peter .
good . is he all right ?
yeah , but he wants us to stop keller &apos;s transfer .
why ?
i don &apos;t know . just do it .
diana , the convoy is already on lafayette .
radio the drivers .
okay , will do .
ridgefield 429 , this is agent jones . come in .
repeat -- ridgefield 429 , this is agent jones . come in .
you gonna respond to that ?
let &apos;s do this !
don &apos;t move ! do exactly what i say and you live .
we &apos;re secure !
let &apos;s go .
ridgefield 429 , come in .
come on !
hey , man , what are you doing ?
sorry . the fee &apos;s too high for excess baggage .
come on , this wasn &apos;t the deal !
he &apos;s out !
he &apos;s out ! cover the other side !
we &apos;ve got a runner !
oh , whoa , whoa , okay .
why is there a tree on your dashboard ?
it &apos;s a hybrid .
it &apos;s showing me how efficiently i &apos;m driving .
you &apos;re not driving very green .
all your leaves are falling off .
do you want to catch keller ?
i feel like i &apos;m stuck inside the giving tree --
nothing left but a stump .
i &apos;ll grow a new one over the weekend .
jones , what &apos;s going on ?
keller escaped .
there were three guards in the transfer convoy
keller &apos;s in custody .
we &apos;ve confirmed that keller paid off two of them and the driver .
lang was paid a ransom --
caffrey ! berrigan ! my office .
um , he over to the hangar .
i &apos;ll meet up with you when it &apos;s done .
keller &apos;s late .
i wonder what he &apos;s planning .
he &apos;s a hell of a chess player .
i imagine him sitting in his cell ,
plotting every second of this escape .
there &apos;s something he &apos;s not telling you .
hey , i have the ring , so he &apos;s not going anywhere .
with all his debts to the russian mob
and the security firm ,
i wouldn &apos;t be surprised
if he already spent more than it &apos;s worth .
shut up .
are you sure you have the real ring ?
maybe keller paid off your people . hey .
wouldn &apos;t be the first time .
now is quiet time .
i get it . the feds hassled you .
they made your life very unpleasant .
so , you thought that you could do one last job
and disappear .
he is not gonna hold up his end of the bargain .
you are going down for this . hey !
i know what i &apos;m doing .
do you understand that ?
i shot him once , okay ?
and now i &apos;m gonna finish the job .
the only thing is , you &apos;re not good with a gun .
you hold it with no secondary support . uh @-@ huh .
and you use your trigger finger to brace for recoil ,
which means you shoot off target .
no wonder keller survived when you first shot him .
you couldn &apos;t hit a man 3 feet in front of you
with a full magazine .
well , let &apos;s give it a try .
we told you to go home .
and you were to take him there !
sir , i know that , but --
but you made an exchange --
exactly what we said we don &apos;t do .
sir , in his defense , no one knows keller better than neal .
had we interceded in any way ,
he thought they would have killed peter .
i &apos;ll deal with you later .
right now , we &apos;ve got a free criminal
and a captive agent to get back .
now do your job . get him out of here .
the exchange was the only way to contact peter .
and we almost stopped keller .
i know .
i can &apos;t just go home .
neal ... you don &apos;t have a choice .
thanks for sticking up for me in there .
i &apos;ll let you know as soon as i hear something , okay ?
this is jones .
i &apos;ve got peter on the line !
peter , i &apos;m gonna put you on speaker and start a trace .
burke !
burke , it &apos;s hughes .
tell us your location .
i need to talk to neal .
where are you ?
reese , put neal on the phone .
i &apos;m here , peter .
listen carefully .
i &apos;m in a locked cell .
lang is three feet away from me , knocked out next to his gun .
keller is en route .
you need me to talk you through a jail break .
yeah .
that &apos;s -- that &apos;s my husband . put him on speaker .
i &apos;m sorry , ma &apos;am . i &apos;m not authorized --
you have my husband on the line ! put him on speaker !
the cell is roughly 8x12 .
it &apos;s made of cement and metal bars .
there &apos;s a locked , hinged door .
clear a space . 8x12 perimeter .
let &apos;s do it !
the cell &apos;s in the middle of a schmatta @-@ shop basement .
there are cardboard boxes , an old metal chair ,
a can of soda , which was a gift ,
two lamps , light bulb ,
thread , fabric ...
... and some really creepy mannequins .
okay , tell me about the door .
the cell door
has an electronic keypad -- fassbinder es @-@ 320 .
ah , fassbinder chips are hardwired to a power source ,
plus a backup battery .
can we disable it with anything here ?
uh ... neal ?
i &apos;m thinking , peter !
think faster .
all right , look -- look for the hardwire connection to the lock .
okay , got it . feels like a thin gauge .
i &apos;m guessing if i cut it --
you &apos;ll activate the lock &apos;s redundancy mechanism .
no , we need -- we need to short the backup
before cutting the electricity .
there &apos;s a conduit that runs alongside the cell .
follow that conduit to the fuse box .
i got it . it &apos;s right on the back wall .
i &apos;m putting you on speaker .
okay , all right , uh ...
here &apos;s where it gets a little tricky , peter .
pull back the inside panel .
you &apos;ll see two hot wires and a neutral . strip the neutral .
hang on , i got to make a quick wire stripper
out of the soda can .
look at you , improvising without me .
done .
okay , uh ... all right ,
break the light bulb and attach the filament
to the battery of your cellphone .
the filament conducts the charge ...
which creates a surge , shorts the power ,
and the locking mechanism should release .
&quot; should &quot; ?
it will .
has it occurred to you
that in order to use my cellphone battery --
we &apos;re gonna have to disconnect .
it &apos;s the final step , peter .
hey .
oh , god .
we &apos;ve got a lock on his location --
textile shop off of 9th and 39th .
burke , stay on the line .
there &apos;s team on their way .
there &apos;s no time .
come on , peter .
how long should it take if this works ?
a few seconds .
please , honey , you can do this .
peter !
i &apos;m out .
hang tight , peter . we &apos;re on our way .
i &apos;ve got lang at gunpoint .
all right , let &apos;s go !
you better hurry .
keller &apos;s on his way , too .
fbi ! don &apos;t move !
jones , it &apos;s me !
peter ?
yeah , clear around back .
there he is ...
... escape artist extraordinaire , peter bburke .
what happened with keller ?
he hasn &apos;t shown .
he won &apos;t . he &apos;s smarter than that .
who knows -- maybe he never planned on showing ,
seeing as how he didn &apos;t trust lang .
which would have left lang
with the ring , the debts , and you .
uh , speaking of which ...
oh , right . yeah , thanks . it &apos;s --
before i hand that back to you , is it stolen ?
well , it &apos;s never been reported as stolen .
listen , if it &apos;s legitimately yours ,
the fbi can &apos;t hold onto it .
well , it &apos;s been missing for a couple hundred years ,
but , uh ...
it doesn &apos;t belong to me .
so ...
you may want to contact the scotland royal museum .
what ?
hey , hon .
hey , hon .
keller .
i saw the surprise party you set up for me .
it &apos;s very kind . i &apos;m sorry i couldn &apos;t make it .
yeah , me too .
i couldn &apos;t have escaped without you , neal .
but i guess we both got what we wanted , right ?
i wouldn &apos;t say that .
how about we call this one a draw ?
we &apos;ll take a break for a while . what do you say ?
i &apos;m gonna find you , keller .
well , that might be tough . i &apos;m already outside your radius .
hey , caffrey ...
