i think i &apos;m gonna throw up .
come on , jer , it &apos;s been 25 years .
the playing field has been leveled .
just be yourself , you &apos;ll have a great time .
yeah , that didn &apos;t work out so well for me the first time .
laura &apos;s here ; i didn &apos;t know she was coming back .
see , you always had a thing for her .
it &apos;s not like that .
wow . she does look really good .
i &apos;m gonna ... i &apos;m gonna go share some aloha .
you do that .
hairy jerry ortega .
long time , man .
hey , i heard you wrote a book .
not me .
oh , that &apos;s right .
you invented that shave ice thingy .
good for you .
nope . not me either .
so what the hell you been doing for the last 25 years ?
what , since you shoved me in a gym locker ?
dude ... you &apos;re not still pissed about that , are you ?
no . why would i be pissed ?
you know , you just humiliated me
in front of the entire student body . no biggie .
oh . hey , there &apos;s big moku .
excuse me .
a cop ?
just like your old man .
good for you .
hey , you ever get married ?
what ? five @-@ o ?
oh , brah , did they give you a badge ?
well ... i &apos;m actually more of a consultant for five @-@ o.
we don &apos;t carry badges .
but it &apos;s real frontline stuff .
a couple weeks ago ,
i stun @-@ gunned a chinese spy .
for real ? !
for reals .
we should go on a ride @-@ along sometime .
actually , we don &apos;t do those things .
that &apos;s hpd .
oh . well , that &apos;s okay .
&apos;cause i actually meant ride @-@ along ...
in the car , to a bar .
there &apos;s a great new place that just opened on merchant street .
i &apos;ll call you .
okay .
naughty nani .
most likely to be married five times .
she just dumped number six .
ooh . an opening .
i got a shot .
what ?
nothing .
okay , everybody . sorry to interrupt the fun ,
but it is time for the grand unveiling
of our class time capsule !
okay . as you know ,
every graduating senior had to place a special item
in the capsule to be reclaimed at our 25th reunion .
go , nani !
so let &apos;s get started .
okay . oh , my gosh .
this is a blast from the past .
are you ready ?
* girl , you know it &apos;s true . *
all right , next we have ...
please ! you got to help me !
he &apos;s trying to kill me ! help ! please !
the p.a. room .
stay here .
help ! help !
chin ,
over here !
please , someone help me !
should be just past that tree line .
looks like somebody knew we were coming .
your friend in the cia moves fast .
yeah .
but he &apos;s a little sloppy .
got the whole place locked down .
no one &apos;s going in or out .
okay . let &apos;s hope our killer &apos;s still here .
thanks , duke .
hey , you okay , cuz ?
yeah . this way .
all right , so do we have an i.d. on our vic ?
yeah . laura richmond .
she &apos;s the great @-@ granddaughter of lon richmond ,
founder of the richmond macadamia nut company .
old money .
did you know her ?
we had a couple of classes together .
i heard she went to college on the mainland .
jerry said she hadn &apos;t been back to the island in 25 years .
hey , jer , maybe you ought to step outside for this , huh ?
never even got to say hello .
what do you think , max ?
well , this is a first .
death by stiletto .
the sad irony is our victim could have survived the fall
if she didn &apos;t land
on the sharp heel of her own shoe .
it appears to have punctured her aorta .
what &apos;s that ?
find anything else on her ?
no .
i &apos;ll , uh , bring it to the lab and get it processed .
okay .
so , laura returns home for the first time
in 25 years and dies within hours of landing .
either she &apos;s the unluckiest woman on the planet ...
or someone didn &apos;t want her to come back .
you &apos;re an amazing travel companion .
anybody ever tell you that ?
i mean , the time &apos;s just ...
flying by here .
maybe @-@ maybe i thought we &apos;d see if the copilot
wants to play backgammon or something .
i &apos;m sorry , okay ?
i @-@ i appreciate you coming , danny , i do .
i &apos;m ... i @-@ i &apos;m just ...
you &apos;re disappointed . i understand .
it &apos;s a really long way to fly to find an empty coffin .
which , by the way ,
there is zero chance the cia did not know
that whoever was occupying that coffin meant something to you .
yeah , or doris .
&apos;cause that &apos;s what this is all about .
i &apos;m telling you , i guarantee ,
my mother is linked to that missing body somehow .
either that or she &apos;s responsible for the ...
body being in the ground in the first place .
oh , you don &apos;t want to go down that road .
did you have any contact with laura tonight ?
yes , i did .
i had to write laura &apos;s name tag by hand .
she never rsvp &apos;d .
so no one knew in advance that she would be here .
i was totally shocked when she walked in the door .
she &apos;s never been to any of our reunions before .
our alumni newsletter always came back &quot; return to sender . &quot;
i don &apos;t know anyone
she &apos;s even kept in touch with since graduation .
when i heard she was here , i was ...
i was really looking forward to catching up with her , you know ?
it had been so long .
but she seemed so anxious .
hmm . how so ?
oh , it was weird . it was ...
she was asking what we had planned for the night .
was there any event in particular she was curious about ?
no . no , she just ...
she grabbed a program
and then she said that we &apos;d catch up later .
and then ...
and then ...
okay .
hey , it &apos;s okay .
we &apos;re done . we &apos;re ... okay .
i &apos;ll give you my number before i leave .
for that drink , you know ?
laura and i dated all through senior year , but , uh ...
we broke up before school ended .
we were going to different colleges .
we didn &apos;t think that we could handle the long @-@ distance thing .
we didn &apos;t stay in touch after that .
did you talk to her this afternoon ?
i tried , but she was kind of distracted .
she said that she would find me later .
it sounds like that &apos;s what laura was saying to everyone .
do you have any idea what had her so preoccupied ?
when she walked in ,
i was so glad to see her , you know ?
it had been so long .
i guess ... i guess i was just hoping
that she missed the old gang and ...
that she was here to catch up .
excuse me . thank you .
you getting the same story i am ?
yeah . laura was distracted ,
and anyone who wanted to talk to her ,
she said she &apos;d find them later .
right .
so then the question is :
why would laura come all the way back for her high school reunion
if she had no interest in reuniting ?
hey , guys .
so csu found laura &apos;s purse in the p.a. room
with a cash withdrawal receipt from bank of waikiki
for $ 200,000 .
time stamp is 1 : 58 p.m. ,
which means that she went to a bank
two hours before she got to the reunion .
okay , so did csu recover the money ?
no , nothing on her person or in her rental car .
the money &apos;s gone .
okay , so maybe this is a robbery .
someone followed her from the bank to the reunion .
no , there &apos;s no way she &apos;s walking around the school gym
with $ 200,000 stuffed in her purse .
okay , then where is it ?
commander , i was told that you were out of town .
yeah , i just got back .
uh , and i need a favor , max .
i take it this is more of the unofficial kind ?
it is .
i need you to run dna on that for me , please .
best you don &apos;t ask any questions , max .
thanks .
welcome home .
thanks .
you find what you were looking for ?
uh , working on it .
i &apos;d ask you how the reunion was going ,
but the body bag kind of gives it away .
yeah . let &apos;s take a ride , i &apos;ll fill you in .
all right .
努阿努
i can &apos;t believe this .
i @-@ i didn &apos;t even know she was in town .
did she call you ?
no , i had no idea .
why did laura leave oahu after high school ?
college . in new york .
we thought she &apos;d come home afterwards , but ...
she said she liked the cold .
that it suited her .
laura battled depression a long time .
after our parents died , years would go by
when she wouldn &apos;t contact us at all ,
wouldn &apos;t come home for holidays .
when was the last time you heard from her ?
a few weeks ago .
i remember she sounded , uh ... ... better .
maybe it was wishful thinking on my part ,
but she sounded happier , stronger .
like she was finally finding her way .
you know , after laura landed , she stopped at the bank of waikiki
and withdrew $ 200,000 from your family &apos;s trust .
any idea why she might &apos;ve done that ?
no , that would be very unlike her .
laura rarely took from the trust .
uh , she didn &apos;t want the family money .
it was a ... a point of pride with her , you know ?
she could ... she could take care of herself .
excuse me .
hey , kono . what &apos;s up ?
so the prints came back from the playing card
that we found on laura &apos;s body .
they belong to an anthony gibson .
tony gibson ?
he was in my chem class senior year .
well , he &apos;s been a very busy boy since graduation .
there &apos;s a warrant out for him in st. petersburg , florida .
he &apos;s a person of interest in a case down there
involving blackmail and extortion .
yeah , i remember seeing him at the reunion .
yeah , well , by the time hpd locked it down , he was long gone .
he was never questioned .
any idea where he is now ?
yeah , i ran his phone ;
it put him at the pacific marina inn .
danny &apos;s already on his way .
he &apos;ll meet you guys there .
all right , good work .
hello ?
you find tony gibson ?
voila !
nothing up my sleeve
and nothing in my ...
wallet !
thank you .
thank you . just a normal wallet , you can see that .
and remember , though , what they say about money--
it can really burn a hole in your pocket .
thank you , sir .
you can count it ,
it &apos;s almost all there .
you guys are great . really great crowd .
okay , for my next trick ,
i need everybody to come up to the stage , okay ?
everybody , come on up to the stage .
that &apos;s right , get close .
move on down .
it doesn &apos;t work if you &apos;re not here with me .
let me out of here !
come on !
let you out of here ? houdini , that &apos;s on you .
let &apos;s see it .
my leg &apos;s cramping .
what the hell do you guys want ?
we want to talk to you about your latest trick ,
disappearing from a murder scene , okay ?
put your hands on the car .
murder ? what murder ?
chin , this is a joke , right ?
make it easy on yourself and do what the man says .
hey , you know , the only thing that i despise
more than a clown is a magician .
well , i &apos;m an illusionist , thank you .
oh , illusionist .
what does that mean ?
it &apos;s different .
it &apos;s different , danny .
really ?
the cut and restored rope trick .
you know i was doing this in the fourth grade ? he &apos;s good .
come on , amazing .
all right , tony .
let &apos;s talk .
let &apos;s see your average magician do that .
that &apos;s pretty impressive , man .
how about jail cells ? you good with those ?
i don &apos;t play small rooms .
but you guys obviously think i belong there for some reason .
yeah , we do ,
and her name was laura richmond .
maybe you remember her .
yeah .
of course .
we all went to kukui together .
all right , well ,
we would like to know why you went to the reunion and killed her .
what ?
that was pretty good .
you ever think about giving up being an illusionist
and , uh , maybe try acting ?
hey , you know what , i hear halawa prison
has a really good theater troupe .
yeah ?
yeah .
halawa ? guys , come on .
i @-@ i didn &apos;t kill anybody , okay ?
i didn &apos;t even know laura was dead .
chin , dude ,
you know me .
we were lab partners all senior year .
yeah , as deep as that bond runs ,
i &apos;m not about to look the other way
when you murder one of our classmates .
guys , i swear , i didn &apos;t kill anybody , okay ?
why would i kill laura ? i liked laura .
i don &apos;t know , uh , personally ,
i think it &apos;s probably got something to do with blackmail ,
which is the same thing you &apos;re wanted for in florida , right ?
so , how did it work , amazing ?
you got some dirt on laura ,
and you knew she had some nut money .
you thought it was gonna be an easy payday , right ?
so she shows up at the reunion with all that cash ,
but somehow the deal goes sideways .
you kill her , and then you take off
before we open the time capsule , that sound about right ?
first of all , that whole blackmail business
in florida was a giant misunderstanding , okay ?
and second of all ,
i only bailed early on the reunion because the hotel called ,
said their friday night act canceled
and could i fill in .
i need the cash , so i split .
how do you explain this ?
seriously ? yeah .
i planted those on a bunch of people ,
laura included .
it &apos;s my trademark .
what do you mean , your trademark ?
i was gonna do the spectator &apos;s pocket bit
before the night was over .
&apos;cause the chicks dig it .
this guy knows what i &apos;m talking about .
right ?
don &apos;t do that .
okay , look , i &apos;ll prove it . chin ?
check your left jacket pocket .
ace of spades .
how does he do it ?
you &apos;re still annoying , though .
well , aloha .
ever consider a career in show business ?
&apos;cause i could always use a box jumper ,
especially one as smoking hot as you .
hey , open your mouth again , tony ,
i &apos;m gonna show you the disappearing teeth trick .
what do you got ?
okay , so , pacific marina confirmed that tony arrived
prior to laura &apos;s t.o.d.
oh , great , so that clears this guy .
well , i also dumped laura &apos;s phone ,
which led me to finding out what happened to the missing 200k .
so , after she landed ,
laura made a call to honolulu general .
and i spoke with an administrator there
who met with her shortly before the reunion .
it turns out that laura paid for
a patient &apos;s entire hospital bill in cash ,
and she wanted to be anonymous .
it was $ 198,756 .
patient &apos;s name is nina johnson .
and what &apos;s her connection to laura ?
i don &apos;t know , i couldn &apos;t find one .
&quot; couldn &apos;t find one &quot; ? what , is it just a random act of kindness ?
no , if she came back here after all this time ,
i don &apos;t think anything she did was random .
i agree , i agree .
listen , see if you can track down nina johnson , see what she knows .
if we can figure out why laura came back ,
maybe we can work out why she was killed .
jerry , you should go home .
i know .
she was always so nice to me .
i mean , you might not believe this ,
but i wasn &apos;t very popular back in the day .
but laura ...
even though she was one of the cool kids ,
she always went out of her way to talk to me .
i really appreciated it .
i &apos;m just sorry i never got to tell her .
jerry , we &apos;re gonna find out who did this .
i &apos;d like to help .
i know .
and when we need you , i promise you we will call .
i found some rather curious chemicals on the victim &apos;s right hand .
according to the lab , it is a combination of metol ,
phenidone and hydroquinone--
chemicals commonly found together in developer .
developer ? like in a dark room ?
precisely .
okay , laura was only on the island
for about six hours , so it seems kind of odd
that she &apos;d be developing photos .
indeed . and i didn &apos;t find any traces
of the chemical on both hands ,
so i suspect it was a transfer .
which means it could have come from her killer .
how was your trip ?
what ?
your little mission in cambodia .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
you don &apos;t know me , all right ?
and you need to believe me when i tell you
i &apos;m not gonna quit , i &apos;m not gonna stop ,
i &apos;m gonna do everything i have to do
until i find out who was in that grave .
i guarantee that will be the biggest mistake of your life .
you know what ? stop . no more threats .
no more threats .
what are you doing ?
take it .
you want to stop me , that &apos;s the only way
you &apos;re gonna stop me . take it .
my office . twenty hundred .
are you serious ?
this woman paid my hospital bill ?
so you don &apos;t know her ?
no .
i &apos;ve never seen her before .
i @-@ i wish i could help you ,
but none of this makes any sense .
i &apos;m sorry .
that &apos;s all right .
pipeline junior nationals . that &apos;s impressive .
oh , that was my son corey &apos;s trophy .
wait a minute , corey johnson ?
i remember his name when i was coming up as a surfer .
well , if you think that &apos;s impressive , you should see his room .
they said my boy could have been a world champion .
could have ?
he disappeared almost 25 years ago .
what happened ?
full moon .
he went out one night to surf , and he never came home .
the police said he must have drowned , but in my heart ,
i never believed it .
they never even found his body .
kelly slater came in second .
you must have been very proud .
chin .
mrs. johnson , do you know who this is with your son ?
they seem very close .
teenage boys don &apos;t tell their moms a lot .
why do you ask ?
well , because the girl in the photo is laura richmond ,
the woman who paid your hospital bill .
you know , judging from those photos ,
it looks like corey and laura were seeing each other .
yeah . which is interesting ,
because when i interviewed alan lim at the reunion ,
he said he and laura were dating all senior year .
yeah , they were . everyone knew it .
you know , corey went to a different school ,
so laura could have been seeing him on the side ,
and maybe lim found out .
you &apos;re thinking alan killed corey out of jealousy 25 years ago .
you know , not only that ,
i &apos;m thinking she might have had knowledge of it ,
and that &apos;s why she paid nina &apos;s medical bill .
out of guilt . okay .
still doesn &apos;t explain why laura was killed yesterday .
well , maybe paying those bills
wasn &apos;t enough to ease her conscience .
maybe she was finally gonna say something
about what happened to corey .
you know , if she was and alan knew it ,
that &apos;s a pretty strong motive for him to kill her .
hey , what happened ?
neighbor called it in .
said she heard a disturbance .
looks like a possible home invasion .
that man &apos;s our suspect in a homicide .
is he gonna make it ?
don &apos;t know .
we are bringing in a male , approximately 40 years old .
severe trauma . i repeat ...
first on scene thinks it was a home invasion .
you believe that ?
well , laura richmond and alan lim were both at the reunion .
laura &apos;s in the morgue and now alan &apos;s in the e.r.
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s a coincidence .
all right . both assaults
were up close and personal , with no weapons .
they knew their attacker .
all right , so right now ,
alan is the only guy who can give us an i.d.
i want an officer with him at all times .
the minute he wakes up ,
i want someone there to take his statement .
copy that .
it &apos;s max .
hey , max . you got something ?
commander mcgarrett ,
i &apos;m so sorry to give you this news , uh ,
but i don &apos;t know what happened . i ...
max . relax .
what &apos;s going on ?
the sample you gave me .
i sent it over to the lab for processing , but ...
they say it never arrived .
very predictable .
i &apos;m doing whatever i can
to track down its whereabouts , but ...
as soon as the sample left my office ,
it &apos;s as if it simply vanished .
you know what , max ?
don &apos;t even worry about it , okay ?
i mean , it &apos;s not your fault .
all right ?
thank you for the call , i appreciate it .
whoa . whoa , whoa . stop .
what ?
why are you not upset by this news ?
i would be upset if i gave max the whole sample .
oh , you stuffed a little on the side ,
like , uh , for a rainy day or something , huh ?
you want to beat these guys , you got to play by their rules .
i like it , i like it .
there &apos;s the guy i know and love .
you like that ?
yeah , it &apos;s good .
okay , listen .
there &apos;s definitely a connection between laura &apos;s murder
and the attack on alan lim .
we just need to figure out
why the killer was targeting both of them .
we think this goes back to corey johnson &apos;s
disappearance 25 years ago .
so laura and alan were somehow involved
with whatever happened to him .
okay , well , what did happen ?
well , that &apos;s the thing nobody knows for sure ,
but at the time ,
everyone assumed that he drowned .
okay , well , let &apos;s say he didn &apos;t drown .
let &apos;s say he disappeared some other way
and someone out there is blaming alan and laura
and this is about revenge .
okay , or it could be that alan and laura
were simply witnesses to what happened ,
and our killer tried to silence them .
okay , but either way , why wait 25 years ?
i got that case file you asked for .
oh , thanks .
i was a rookie back then , but i remember the case .
corey johnson was a strong swimmer .
the night he disappeared ,
the surf was calm
ankle slappers at the most .
was foul play ever suspected ?
there was no evidence to support it at the time .
corey didn &apos;t have any enemies .
but i &apos;ll tell you this ,
i was never convinced the kid drowned .
all right , so it looks like witnesses
spotted a vehicle matching alan lim &apos;s
near the beach the night corey johnson disappeared .
but alan claimed that he was at laura &apos;s house all evening ,
and she backs him up .
she said they were watching a movie .
so laura was alan &apos;s alibi .
maybe she was lying just to protect her boyfriend .
you think they know about corey ?
i &apos;m thinking three people know :
alan , laura and the person who tried to shut them up .
i got catherine . catherine , go ahead .
so , listen , i &apos;ve been following up
on the photochemical transfer found on laura &apos;s hand .
the gps from her rental car
indicated that she parked at the kaimana mall .
turns out that one of the 30 shops
is an old @-@ school photo store
that still develops 35 @-@ millimeter film .
okay , we talk to the owner ?
yeah . he said that she stopped by
asking if he could develop film that was 25 years old .
they must &apos;ve shaken hands .
that &apos;s how she got the chemical on her .
right .
all right , so where &apos;s the film ?
she told the owner that she didn &apos;t have it on her ,
and that she would come back later .
he kept the shop open , but she never showed up .
whatever &apos;s on that film got laura killed .
okay , but we didn &apos;t find any film on her .
killer could have taken it .
or maybe laura was killed
before she could get her hands on it .
that &apos;s why she went to the reunion .
everyone we interviewed said
laura was preoccupied at the reunion .
she was asking about all the events ,
but i think there was only one she really cared about
the opening of the time capsule .
corey had these same rockets in his room .
thanks for doing this , jer .
happy i could help .
luckily for you guys , i don &apos;t trust digital .
no way .
what is it ?
that &apos;s laura &apos;s brother , bradley .
that photo was taken on the night corey disappeared .
laura lied to the police .
the three of them were with corey that night .
you really think they could be responsible
for corey going missing ?
i don &apos;t know .
laura &apos;s dead , alan &apos;s in the hospital ,
so there &apos;s only one other person who could answer that .
bradley richmond .
what &apos;s going on ?
where &apos;s bradley ?
i saw him walking towards the maze a little while ago .
why ?
over here !
all right , i &apos;m gonna go out on a limb and say that &apos;s corey johnson .
okay , so bradley was trying to move the body ,
get rid of the evidence .
all right , he must &apos;ve heard us coming .
he couldn &apos;t have gotten far .
come on . he knows where he &apos;s going , we don &apos;t .
no , i got something . i got something .
guys , we got to split up . come on .
and on your right , the beautiful blue waters
of kaiona beach .
yo , what &apos;s up , bruddah ?
hey . hey , you in the air ?
doing the newlywed special as we speak .
how fast can you get to the richmond estate ?
five minutes . why ?
i got a perp on the move ; i could use an eye in the sky .
copy that .
hang on , lovebirds .
i guess you guys got some extra time .
bradley richmond !
bradley !
use your head , bradley !
it &apos;s all over !
bradley , we know you &apos;re in here !
we know you killed corey !
now come out ! it &apos;s over !
hey ! he &apos;s over here !
mcgarrett , i got a guy in a yellow shirt
moving like a mongoose .
good , good , good . which direction ?
straight .
what do you mean , straight ?
you got an instrument panel in front of you .
look at the compass . which direction ?
oh , north . north . he heading north .
north .
bradley ?
he just changed direction . going west .
left .
he just went through a hole in the hedge .
he &apos;s heading east .
right .
keep going . make another right .
he &apos;s coming back your way !
three ...
two ...
one .
boo @-@ yah !
takedown , mcgarrett style !
guys , over here !
i got him !
you &apos;re under arrest
for the murder of corey johnson and laura richmond .
i didn &apos;t kill my sister , alan lim did .
what the hell &apos;s this ?
what &apos;s going on ?
we recovered corey &apos;s body , alan .
he probably looks a little different
than when you and bradley buried him in the maze 25 years ago .
i don &apos;t know anyone named corey .
sure you do .
laura knew him , too . in fact , laura liked him .
didn &apos;t she ?
she liked him a lot .
that &apos;s why he &apos;s dead , isn &apos;t it , alan ?
you knew that she had a thing for corey ,
but you were too much of a coward
to confront him ... by yourself .
you needed bradley to help you .
you know what ?
if that &apos;s where you found the body ,
maybe you should go ask bradley how it got there .
why don &apos;t you ask him yourself .
it &apos;s over .
i told them everything .
why ?
why would you do that ?
you killed laura .
that &apos;s my sister .
she was going to go to the cops .
i have a family .
i have a life !
she wanted to ruin everything .
no . all she wanted to do was tell the truth
about what happened that night .
she couldn &apos;t live with the guilt anymore .
we all swore that we would never tell anyone what happened .
you swore to me !
