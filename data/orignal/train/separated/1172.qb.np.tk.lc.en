we have your daughter on tape
shoplifting a pair of sunglasses .
i &apos;m taking care of it .
my dad-- is he your father too ?
who told you ?
melissa doesn &apos;t know either .
how could you not tell her ?
we &apos;ve got to talk about that interview .
this is a huge opportunity for you .
copies of a particular page
of alison &apos;s autopsy report have been stolen .
this is from a security camera outside the morgue .
just making sure you &apos;re in as deep as i am .
she &apos;s coming upstairs .
that &apos;s alison , about to walk in and find them .
vivian owes you money ?
two thousand .
and she had a friend named alison
who was getting texts from somebody .
she was looking for someone .
who ?
i think that i can find that out ,
but i &apos;m going to need you to trust me ... $ 2,000 worth .
we &apos;re giving him all of it ?
$ 2,000 is a lot of money !
emily , if he can finally tell me who &quot; a &quot; is ,
i would hand over a million .
yeah , and not ask for change .
how &apos;d you get the money so fast ?
what ? um ... i have a relative .
which one ?
i promised that i wouldn &apos;t say .
what time did jonah say to meet him ?
six , but , um , look , not all of us are gonna go .
it &apos;s just me and spencer , so we &apos;ll meet up with you afterwards .
why just you two ?
because i &apos;m the face that he knows , and she &apos;s the bank .
if we crowd him , he &apos;s gonna think something &apos;s up .
something is up .
we &apos;re finally gonna find out
who &apos;s been torturing us since ali &apos;s funeral ,
and , hello , i kind of wanna be there for that .
volume !
hey , ladies !
hey .
okay . um , hanna , can i borrow you for a sec ?
what &apos;s up ?
can you drive this afternoon , to the mall ?
i thought i had wheels , but my mom ...
wait , that &apos;s today ?
yes !
you said you were gonna help me pick out something for this party .
please don &apos;t bail on me .
what &apos;s the deal ? did something more important suddenly pop up ?
no , no . it &apos;s just my mom wants me home .
could we do it tomorrow ?
tomorrow is about the accessories . forget it .
look , i &apos;m sorry , mona . i totally spaced .
han ? we &apos;re gonna go to lunch .
we &apos;ll meet you there .
don &apos;t hold up your friends , han .
it &apos;s no biggie . i &apos;ll just find someone else .
no , we &apos;ll just cut out after lunch tomorrow .
what &apos;s up ? who texted you ?
mona , what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing . some idiot just got the wrong number .
all right , well , we &apos;ll talk soon , okay ?
afternoon , ashley .
what do you want ?
well , you &apos;re not returning any of my phone calls .
i need to talk to hanna .
you ever hear of a doorbell ?
i thought you wouldn &apos;t want your neighbors
to see a cop on your doorstep again .
what &apos;s he doing here ?
hey , hanna .
i just have some follow @-@ up questions
about your dress @-@ up day at the morgue with your friends .
coming here like this is harassment .
i &apos;m just trying to get to the bottom of things .
unless you &apos;re charging my daughter with something ,
we have nothing else to talk about .
i thought it would be nicer to talk here , but ...
if you prefer the station ...
that &apos;s fine . i &apos;ll see you there .
you &apos;ve told me everything , right ?
yeah . of course .
okay .
we have nothing to worry about .
why would mom go along with this ?
it wasn &apos;t easy for her . she &apos;s angry too .
she feels betrayed .
don &apos;t protect her . she lied to us .
mom &apos;s had to watch jason every day
since he was a little kid .
i &apos;m sure somewhere in her heart , she knew .
we should have known too .
it &apos;s like we don &apos;t know who mom and dad are anymore .
yeah , tell me about it .
we have to rethink everything they &apos;ve ever told us .
i &apos;m pretty sure alison knew .
really ? why ?
i don &apos;t know , just ...
little things she &apos;d say .
does anyone else know ?
no . i don &apos;t think so .
then let &apos;s keep it that way .
our family has suffered enough humiliation for ten lifetimes .
i don &apos;t want to be here when mom and dad get home .
um ... i &apos;ll call you later , okay ?
yeah .
spencer ...
hmm ?
we &apos;ll get through this .
you &apos;re trying to reach is unavailable .
why aren &apos;t you calling me back ?
if silence is your way of breaking up with me ,
then i &apos;m really starting to feel like--
looks good .
just don &apos;t sit coach fulton anywhere near mr. donovan .
i &apos;m gonna walk around town later ,
try to get store owners to buy some ads for the program .
you wanna come ?
i &apos;m not really good at asking people for money .
please , you &apos;re the star of the team .
who could possibly turn you down ?
besides , now that the season &apos;s over ,
what else do you have to do ?
all right . count me in .
cool .
so , i know we &apos;re both violently opposed to poly blends ,
but this ... made me a believer .
it &apos;s cute .
cute ? mittens are cute . this is fabulous .
and this ...
cost more than my mother &apos;s car , but , hello !
raw silk , you can &apos;t go wrong .
yeah , they &apos;re both cute .
what did i say about that word ?
did i catch you in the middle of a nap ?
this is getting really boring .
what &apos;s going on ?
i &apos;m getting texts from that same freak
who sent me the one about your liposuction .
what ?
wait , mona , when did this start happening again ?
few days ago .
it &apos;s so creepy-- like i &apos;m being watched 24 / 7 .
what do the texts say ?
first it was dumb stuff-- accusing me of stealing this necklace .
did you ?
d &apos;uh ! yes ! but why is it their business ?
like i &apos;m gonna be scared into returning it . guess again .
maybe you should return it .
fine .
then you have to return half the things in that closet .
mona , are there texts about me too ?
more about your mom . ready for this one ?
this &quot; a &quot; creep expects me to believe
that your mom slept with this goon to save your ass .
okay , no , mona , this is totally photoshopped .
i figured .
people have way too much time on their hands .
does this &quot; a &quot; person want you to do something with that picture ?
no .
what if he or she starts threatening you ?
oh , please .
if i could live through alison dilaurentis
and her nonstop torture ,
i can handle some radioactive texting .
screw it ! i &apos;m going with the raw silk .
what time is it ?
5 : 58 .
okay , what time is it now ?
aria , it &apos;s still 5 : 58 .
he &apos;s coming .
who &apos;s this ?
i &apos;m the money .
she is . she &apos;s the money .
so where is it ?
unh @-@ unh . not until you hand over the info .
no way . i &apos;ve already been burned once .
it &apos;s not gonna happen again .
here .
hear from vivian yet ?
you don &apos;t owe me answers ...
but she does .
this is it .
hey , wait ! no ! whoa ! wait !
there &apos;s no name . there &apos;s no number .
this is just an address . where &apos;s the rest of it ?
the text came from a burner phone .
i was only able to trace the location .
i @-@ i don &apos;t believe this .
that &apos;s all i gave vivian . she was happy with it .
we &apos;re not , okay ? you need to give me back half the money
&apos;cause we only got half the information .
that was the money that was owed to me .
the way i look at it , you got the address for free .
at least we got something .
it &apos;s 20 minutes from here .
how long do you think he &apos;s been there for ?
there &apos;s no way that we &apos;re going to that address right now .
hey . need help with dinner ?
sure . grab a box of pasta ?
you know , i thought it was a little weird ,
the way that wilden stopped by today .
totally unprofessional .
it reminded me of when ...
you know .
i thought we agreed to never talk about that again .
no , i @-@ i know . i just ...
couldn &apos;t help but think about it today .
i &apos;ve always wondered what would happen if people ever found out .
where is this coming from ?
did he call here today after he left ?
did he say something to you ?
no .
if it did get out ...
hanna , please .
... could you lose your job ?
i could lose you .
if your father decided to sue for custody ,
this would be all he would need to get it .
what time is your interview ?
uh , i &apos;m ... heading in there now .
okay . well , can i see you tomorrow ?
my flight gets in at noon .
i &apos;ll just call you when i get in .
hey , maybe we can ...
yeah . okay , em .
yeah , all right . all right .
i &apos;ll see you tomorrow . bye .
what &apos;s up ?
how was school ?
it was fine .
look , i know things have been tense between you and your dad lately ,
but , um , there are other reasons why he &apos;s so worried .
what are you talking about ?
somebody left this on his car .
我知道 此致敬礼 -a
do you have any idea who sent it ?
no .
you know , there was a time when you would share
everything that was going on in your life with me ,
and who was in your life .
mom ! come on , you know everybody that &apos;s in my life .
do you think ezra would know someone who would want to-- ?
no .
do you remember that letter i got last year ,
about dad &apos;s affair with meredith ?
it was signed by &quot; a &quot; too .
i had just assumed that meredith wrote it ,
but now ...
don &apos;t worry .
your dad and i will look into it .
fiddler &apos;s cafe , one hundred .
benny and eddie &apos;s pizza , fifty .
we make a good team .
hey , mom .
i &apos;m still at school , just finishing up with emily .
no , mom , she &apos;s just a friend .
i &apos;ll be home in an hour .
&quot; just a friend &quot; ?
i came out to my parents .
you did ?
how did they take it ?
they freaked out , a little .
some tears , some screaming , but ...
nothing like i thought it would be .
wow . that &apos;s so great . i mean ...
not the screaming part , but ...
great .
i have you to thank for it .
me ?
what did i do ?
you handled coming out so well ,
just made it seem possible for me to do it too .
i don &apos;t know about that .
i do .
i &apos;ve watched you .
thanks .
i &apos;m glad you were able to talk to your parents .
me too .
i just ...
wish i &apos;d done it sooner .
um , i &apos;m sorry . i gotta go .
is that maya ?
no .
here .
i &apos;m really happy for you .
thanks .
so ... that &apos;s why you were never charged with shoplifting ?
okay , you know what ? please , no jokes , no judging .
all of this was over a pair of designer sunglasses ?
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m just still processing .
god , if my mom knew that i told you guys this--
we &apos;d never judge her !
she took me in . she &apos;s amazing .
my mom would have driven me to the station
and offered to take the mug shot .
the real question is ,
why is &quot; a &quot; suddenly going after mona ?
what , we &apos;re not enough ?
&quot; a &quot; knows we &apos;re getting closer .
they can &apos;t turn us against each other ,
so they &apos;re using our friends to hurt us .
how much did you tell mona about &quot; a &quot; ?
nothing .
i didn &apos;t ... say anything .
i feel like i should .
we all know what &quot; a &quot; &apos; s capable of .
yeah , that &apos;s exactly why the less mona knows , the better .
guess you &apos;re right .
i just feel bad lying to her .
where you going ?
i haven &apos;t eaten anything all day .
i &apos;m starting to get a twitch .
when you go down there , could you look outside
and see if garrett &apos;s car is still out front ?
yeah .
he followed me home .
&quot; a &quot; sent my dad a letter ,
trying to get him to catch me and ezra ,
and now my mom &apos;s on the hunt to find out who &quot; a &quot; is .
wait ... shoa ... wait . back up .
why would &quot; a &quot; send your dad a letter like that
if you weren &apos;t still seeing ezra ?
because i am
still seeing him .
guys , i @-@ i &apos;m sorry , okay ? i really wanted to tell you .
i just ... i thought it &apos;d be dangerous .
we understand .
no !
speak for yourself !
didn &apos;t we have , like , multiple conversations where we talked about
how heartbroken we were over losing toby and ezra ? !
i didn &apos;t ...
god , you deserve an oscar for that performance .
look , i &apos;m sorry , okay ,
but if it &apos;s any consolation ,
my dad is doing everything he can to make sure ezra &apos;s
out of my life and rosewood for good .
come down here ! you guys !
caleb sent me an e @-@ mail .
he told me to open the attachment immediately .
can i do it on your laptop ?
yeah .
what is this about ?
did he crack more of &quot; a &quot; &apos; s phone ?
if he did , i want $ 2,000 back .
what are we supposed to be looking for ?
she &apos;s coming upstairs .
are we about to see alison get killed ?
where is she ?
oh , my god .
it &apos;s melissa !
guys , we need to give this to the cops , like , right now .
i agree !
yeah ! me too .
no !
why ?
i @-@ i need to talk to melissa first .
we need to find out what she was doing in alison &apos;s room .
isn &apos;t it obvious ?
she was a part of that night .
they-- they were all after alison .
you don &apos;t know that . she-- she just--
she could have just been looking for ian .
look , okay , i know that melissa had her issues with alison ,
but i &apos;m not about to turn in my pregnant sister .
i will . watch me .
hanna ! you just asked me not to be so quick to judge your own mother ,
and now you &apos;re ready to throw my sister behind bars !
spencer ! melissa has lied to you so many times .
why do you think she &apos;s gonna tell the truth now ... huh ?
because i haven &apos;t always been so honest with her either .
but maybe if i come clean and i tell her what we saw ...
she &apos;ll come up with a bigger lie !
not if she knows what &apos;s at stake !
please , okay , just ... give me this one night to talk to her .
fine . fine , go to melissa , okay ,
and ... we &apos;ll try to figure out
where &quot; a &quot; was sending those texts from .
spence , talk to her . now .
something to drink ?
uh ... coffee , please .
you lied to me !
mona , where did you get this ?
another gift from &quot; a. &quot;
it was in my mailbox when i got home today .
a police report for shoplifting ? really ?
anything you want to tell me ?
i &apos;m sorry i lied to you , but ...
but this isn &apos;t something that you advertise .
well , that &apos;s exactly what &quot; a &quot; wants me to do .
what do you mean ?
i have to give the picture
and the police report to the rosewood observer ,
or i &apos;ll be filling out one of these myself .
you know i love your mom ,
but if this gets out ,
they could press charges and i could go to jail ,
and that cannot happen .
well , i say this is fate ,
bumping into you here like this .
you do work next door ,
and i live a few blocks down the road , so ...
i wouldn &apos;t really call it fate .
it &apos;s just a small town .
are you drinking alone ?
hopefully not anymore .
i would invite you to sit down , but ...
melissa should be here any minute .
probably out of the question
for the three of us to have a meal , huh ?
yeah .
speaking of .
melissa !
what the hell just happened ?
not very sisterly of her .
why would she get in the car with garrett ?
she hardly even knows the guy .
she knows him better than you think .
i saw him with her at a doctor &apos;s appointment last week .
that can &apos;t be true .
i wouldn &apos;t forget that .
people don &apos;t usually bring a glock
to the o.b.g.y.n.
maybe it &apos;s just some kind of sick joke .
no . take it from me , the threat is real .
what do you mean ?
i &apos;ve gotten texts from &quot; a &quot; before , too .
what ?
and so have my friends .
why didn &apos;t you tell me sooner ?
because the less you know , the better .
what the hell is that supposed to mean ?
do you know who &apos;s doing this ?
no .
i don &apos;t , but i also know &quot; a &quot; isn &apos;t playing around .
what has &quot; a &quot; done to you ?
mona , if i told you everything ,
we &apos;d be here till graduation .
so ... what do we do now ?
i don &apos;t know .
but i &apos;ll figure something out , okay ?
you &apos;d better hurry .
she still isn &apos;t answering .
apparently whatever she had to talk to garrett about
was more important than talking to me .
do you want me to give you a lift home ?
home is the last place i want to go .
this is it .
there &apos;s no way we &apos;re gonna get in here .
now what ?
let &apos;s look around .
aria !
that &apos;s definitely not &quot; a &quot; !
come on , let &apos;s go .
you really dodged a bullet ,
not marrying my sister .
i &apos;m sure she &apos;d be happy to hear that .
i &apos;m serious .
my family is so screwed up
that dr. phil wouldn &apos;t even take us on .
hey , my family has issues , too .
oh , really ?
like what ?
did somebody ...
butter their bread with a steak knife ?
just &apos; cause we don &apos;t play &quot; high @-@ low &quot; at the dinner table
doesn &apos;t mean we &apos;re not just as screwed up .
and , for the record ,
i &apos;m looking , and i can &apos;t find anything wrong .
i am plenty messed up .
enlighten me .
uh , for one ,
i have an obsessive need to be the best at everything .
i even have to win at yoga .
all right , that &apos;s a quirk , not a fault ,
and i have plenty of those too .
like ?
like ? um ...
all right , i &apos;m a touch what you &apos;d call o.c.d.
every book on my bookshelf has to be in alphabetical order
or i can &apos;t sleep .
then ... what is aristotle doing on the bottom row ?
it &apos;s okay .
aristotle is exactly where he should be .
remind me to never run backwards on a porch ever again , please .
f.w.l law firm . have you heard of it ?
no , it &apos;s a dead end .
i don &apos;t think so . i &apos;m gonna google it .
so what ?
what , &quot; a &apos;s &quot; a lawyer now ? give me a break !
everybody that works here has got to be over 30 .
found it .
it ... closed down three months ago .
where is emily with our food ?
i &apos;m so hungry .
here &apos;s a list of employees .
&quot; charles lang . &quot;
isn &apos;t that , um , crystal &apos;s father ?
no . crystal &apos;s last name is lee , not lang .
hanna , face it , we got scammed .
so that &apos;s it ? &quot; a &quot; wins ?
either my mom goes down or mona does .
look , i &apos;m sorry .
i remember ...
the first time i saw you ,
and i just thought ...
&quot; damn . &quot;
just ...
spencer ?
yes ?
you &apos;re pissed .
pissed ? !
snockered .
i &apos;m snockered ?
drunk .
totally !
i am ... smashed !
what ?
thought you were really into me .
i am .
very much so .
and that &apos;s why i can &apos;t . not like this .
nope .
thanks .
maya ?
maya , is that you ?
sorry , i ... thought you were someone else .
ohh ! emily !
hey .
hi !
are you okay ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine .
no , you &apos;re not .
what &apos;s wrong ? em , talk to me .
maya and i got in a fight the other night at the party ,
and i haven &apos;t talked to her since .
i don &apos;t know if she &apos;s breaking up with me
or ... if she wants to work it out .
i don &apos;t know anything , &apos; cause she won &apos;t call me back .
don &apos;t you see , em ?
this is who she is .
when things get tough , she bails .
i know you really care about her ,
but ... what you really need is someone you can count on .
thanks .
what are you doing ?
i ...
no , i @-@ i &apos;m sorry if i made you think--
no , i &apos;m ... i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t mean to .
em .
i know it &apos;s past the deadline .
i &apos;m sorry i couldn &apos;t figure things out ,
but ... look , i just want to let you know
that i don &apos;t blame you for what you had to do .
i went to the jewelry store this morning .
you did ? why ?
to bring back the necklace .
what &apos;d they say ?
um , thanks , and ...
have a seat while we call the police .
mona ...
i know .
and i offered to work it off ,
but instead , they contacted my mom .
we made a deal .
looks like i &apos;ll be serving slop to the homeless .
god , mona , i am so sorry .
i can &apos;t believe you would do that for me .
what was i gonna do ,
hurt my best friend and her mom ?
all i know is , they &apos;d better not make me wear a hairnet .
are you going to work ?
nope . just finished my rounds .
what ?
wait , what time is it ?
10 : 30 .
ohh ! i &apos;m late for school .
i &apos;m ... really sorry about last night .
i never meant to impose on you .
you weren &apos;t imposing .
i &apos;m sure i said or did something stupid .
other than a bit of drool on my favorite pillow ,
you were fine .
you &apos;re welcome to stay on my couch any time .
judging from the way things are going at home ,
i might actually take you up on that .
i hope you do .
i &apos;ll call you .
hey . have you heard from ezra ?
yeah , his plane lands in an hour .
但总有一天你会的 -a
everything okay ?
mona , where are you going ?
i &apos;ll take the rest of the day off .
i &apos;m not gonna be a sitting target .
just come eat with us .
i &apos;m not sure your friends--
trust me .
they &apos;re cool .
come on .
okay .
hey , mona . how &apos;s it going ?
i don &apos;t know how you sleep at night .
nice to see you too , ashley .
did you really think you could intimidate my daughter
into confessing to a crime she didn &apos;t commit ?
i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
really ?
what &apos;s this ?
where did you get this ?
found it in hanna &apos;s things .
ashley ...
why would i give this to hanna ?
if this came out , i could lose my job .
well , if you didn &apos;t , who did ?
hey . it &apos;s me again .
i just want you to know that i &apos;m not angry ,
i &apos;m just confused ,
and i miss you like crazy .
please call me back .
i love you , maya .
i &apos;m so sorry my dad made
you go all the way down there to do that .
well , it wasn &apos;t that bad .
actually , i like the campus and the professors .
yeah , well .
i &apos;m just glad it &apos;s all over with .
it &apos;s not . over .
they offered me the job .
they did ?
mm @-@ hmm .
obviously . of course they did . they &apos;d be crazy not to .
what did you say ?
uh ... i haven &apos;t given them an answer yet .
yet ?
aria , your dad is clearly onto us .
he showed up at the restaurant the other night .
well , yeah , of course he &apos;s suspicious ,
but he doesn &apos;t have any proof .
this job is an incredible opportunity for me ,
and if i don &apos;t take it , he will know what &apos;s keeping me here .
we &apos;ll figure out a way around it , like we always do .
i used to think that , and i &apos;m not so sure anymore .
what are you ...
what are you saying ? are you ...
giving up on us ?
no . no , no .
but we &apos;ve been trying to make this work for a long time ,
and ... and what ? ! what ? !
and-- and as much as we love each other ,
i think we are deluding ourselves into believing that it can .
i &apos;ve got class in a few minutes .
i &apos;ll call you later .
honey , what &apos;s wrong ?
go away .
did something happen-- ?
mom , go away . please .
no , i &apos;m not gonna go anywhere
until you tell me why you &apos;re so upset .
fine .
ezra &apos;s leaving , so dad got his wish .
are you happy now ?
what are you talking about ?
he &apos;s taking that job in new orleans .
what job ?
the job that dad set him up with .
when did he do this ?
don &apos;t pretend like you don &apos;t know , mom .
you may have gotten rid of ezra , but guess what--
you lost me too .
do you want me to heat that up for you ?
i &apos;m not really hungry .
you gonna bother unpacking it ?
aria .
no .
i mean , how soon do they want you down there ?
if it &apos;s just a matter of a few days--
i &apos;m not leaving right away .
it already feels like you have .
i don &apos;t believe this !
did you follow me over here with handcuffs ,
or are you just gonna yank me up by my hair ?
i &apos;m not here to bring you home .
i came to listen .
mom , is that you ?
dad ?
it &apos;s just me .
where have you been ?
i &apos;ve been trying to call you for the past 12 hours .
it &apos;s a long story .
i know that you lied to me .
i saw you get into the car with garrett .
i &apos;ll explain everything , but just not here .
why not ?
because mom and dad will be home any minute ...
and i can &apos;t say what i need to say in front of them .
well , what do you need to
say that you can &apos;t say in front of mom and dad ?
do you remember the night of ian &apos;s funeral ,
when i tried to tell you something ?
well , i need to talk to you about it now .
are you coming or not ?
yeah .
okay .
do you take milk in your tea ?
no .
okay , what exactly are we doing here ?
&apos;cause i @-@ i really don &apos;t feel like having
a tea party with the two of you .
well , this is not exactly
how i planned to spend my evening either .
i want to be very clear :
i don &apos;t condone this relationship ,
but i &apos;m also afraid of what may happen
if i take the same stance as my husband .
sorry , so where does that leave us ?
i want to slow things down .
before anybody goes moving away
or running away ...
... i want to understand what this is .
excuse me .
