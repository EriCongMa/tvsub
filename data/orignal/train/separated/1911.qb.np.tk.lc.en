&quot; thrilling &quot;
you don &apos;t have to leave .
it &apos;s okay .
do you want some breakfast ?
you don &apos;t have to do this .
i &apos;m sorry . i @-@ i know i &apos;m not supposed to sleep over .
i was just so tired .
i thought i was gonna close my eyes for a second .
it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s not . i totally agree with you .
this is casual . it &apos;s not about snuggling in the morning .
it &apos;s easy . that &apos;s me . easy peasy lemon squeezy .
leah , i was gonna order some food , so if you want some--
i &apos;m fine . i gotta go find a costume
for this thing at joe &apos;s tonight , so ...
that &apos;s right . it &apos;s halloween .
happy--
every halloween we make a choice
about what kind of costume we &apos;re going to wear--
something sexy ...
morning .
oh , good . can you take these ?
there &apos;s a rip in the bottom left .
oh . i just finished an appy ,
and i was going to do it in the 20 minutes before my lap chole .
but i need to get on the phone and order a 3 @-@ d printer .
your grant got approved ? that &apos;s great .
yeah , it is , except it &apos;s a conflict with a butterfly wing repair .
well , i need to solve my array problem today .
if i can figure out how to shrink the craniotomy ,
i should be able to avoid a lot of the infections that we &apos;re getting .
okay , well , this will only take you four minutes .
i know . i &apos;m just telling you about my day .
oh , well , i did not factor that into the schedule .
and trick @-@ or @-@ treating still on tonight ?
uh , of course , of course .
maybe we &apos;ll be someone scary ...
alex .
did you get the house ready ?
yep .
okay . candy ?
no .
did you get the pumpkins ?
no .
did you put up the spider webs ?
no .
then how is the house ready ?
i got the keg .
oh , you &apos;re having a party at the house ?
um , yeah , alex is letting us use the house to trick @-@ or @-@ treat from
because we have no neighbors where we are ,
so i invited a bunch of families from the day care .
he didn &apos;t tell you ?
no .
oh . you should come .
that &apos;s fine .
right . well , you don &apos;t wanna be around a bunch of kids
hopped up on sugar anyway , right ?
right .
&apos;cause i hate children .
cristina--
but i love your kids .
i should have invited you . i &apos;m sorry . i just thought--
but you should come for a drink .
it &apos;s at 7 . she &apos;s gonna be a butterfly .
i have to go . i have a lap chole .
or you could be a superhero ,
which is what i &apos;m trying to be this year .
how many fingers ?
three . hangnail on the index finger .
no side effects ? my uncle had lasik , like , three years ago .
he still has horrible facial pain
and he &apos;s basically addicted to painkillers .
leah .
well , your uncle probably came back to work too early
and didn &apos;t take the two days off that the doctor recommended .
i am a second @-@ year resident .
16 hours is already more recovery time than i can afford .
go work . leave me alone .
all right .
how &apos;s it going with alex ?
radio silence .
still ?
i think it &apos;s over .
well , i don &apos;t believe that ,
and i have extraordinary vision ...
literally and figuratively .
come on . time to go round on webber .
are you sure you don &apos;t want to go home ?
okay .
hey , kids . you got halloween plans ?
i &apos;ll take it .
yeah , matthew &apos;s having a thing . i &apos;m going as a bunny .
ooh . playboy ?
uh , velveteen .
needs work .
how about you , lone ranger ? are you and emma going out ?
uh , emma and i are no longer a thing .
what ? why ?
well , it &apos;s just too soon . i &apos;m not ready .
yes , you are .
emma doesn &apos;t think so ,
because i never mentioned being married before .
she said , &quot; call me when you &apos;re ready . &quot;
you &apos;re ready . don &apos;t you think he &apos;s ready ?
well , maybe he &apos;s ready , but he &apos;s not ready to call .
what &apos;s the difference ? he &apos;s ready .
you should ...
he &apos;s not ready .
not ready .
hey , um , i have the costume in my car .
what time did you wanna meet ?
no , i have the costume .
oh , please , don &apos;t tell me we have two astronaut costumes .
we don &apos;t . we have a princess .
what ?
yeah .
you--what--that &apos;s what you want--
you want her to strive to be a princess ?
no , it &apos;s what she wants . it &apos;s what she asked for .
no , no , no , no . she told me she wanted to be an astronaut ,
and that &apos;s why i spent three hours last night
sewing patches on a little , tiny flight suit .
yeah , well , i spent the night gluing daisies on a tutu .
fine . we can hold up the costumes ,
and she can decide whose work she loves more .
you know what ? forget it . you take her .
i &apos;m not doing this .
are you serious ?
as the grave .
that is amazing .
what &apos;s amazing ?
dr. webber wants one of us to do his surgery today .
oh ... not you . n @-@ no offense ,
but i heard you walked into a wall this morning .
uh , why not me ?
well , you can supervise .
they know this procedure inside out .
they &apos;re--they &apos;re ready .
i beg to differ .
how do you do a transgastric approach ?
anterior gastrotomy for access and cystogastrostomy creation
through the posterior wall .
what about the posterior approach ?
that is a single gastrotomy in continuity with the pseudocyst .
very nice , and which is the easiest approach ?
it &apos;d have to be the intraluminal approach .
unless you &apos;re a fan of intraoperative bleeding ,
in which case , do what you like .
i thought i wasn &apos;t seeing you until the weekend .
ah , i couldn &apos;t miss trick @-@ or @-@ treating .
just didn &apos;t seem right .
good man .
that &apos;s a bold move , letting the second years
try a procedure like this on you . how you gonna pick ?
bailey , watch them in the e.r. today .
tell me which one deserves it .
none of &apos; em do ,
and i don &apos;t need to spend a day in the e.r.--
dr. bailey , that &apos;s all .
get out of here . we &apos;re gonna review an intraluminal approach .
come on .
okay , so , you , me , and tuck--
we should think of costumes that have three parts ,
like the three stooges .
i have a witch &apos;s hat .
i put it on every year and call it a day .
my day is gonna be about
which of those three residents is gonna kill
the most important patient i &apos;ve ever had .
halloween was ... kind of my family &apos;s thing ,
and i want it to be our family &apos;s thing ,
so go work . i &apos;ll figure it out .
you just come with me at the end of the day
with that face and that body and the ...
i &apos;ll figure out what to put on it .
it &apos;s a holiday for children , you know .
victor brown--
30 @-@ year @-@ old male mauling victim . vitals are stable .
let &apos;s get him to trauma .
what mauled him ?
he--he tackled me . he came out of nowhere .
wait . who is &quot; he &quot; ?
the guy--
he was snarling and growling .
i &apos;m sorry . a person did this to you ?
he started eating my face like some sort of ...
zombie ?
murphy ? edwards ?
it &apos;s the biter . multiple g.s.w.s to the chest .
b.p. 90 over 60 .
pulse in the 120s . he &apos;s on something .
how is this guy stable ?
he &apos;s got two bullet holes over his heart .
cops shot him before he ate that other guy &apos;s whole face off .
and he got 4 of lorazepam .
barely slowed him down .
i want him sedated now .
push 2 of lorazepam and 5 of haldol .
this guy should not be alive .
guys , i can barely hear his heart .
sorry . it &apos;s pretty deep .
just patch me up .
there &apos;s no way i &apos;m missing out on webber &apos;s surgery
because of a little neck lac .
oh , yes , you are .
where did you come from ?
i &apos;m everywhere ,
and you are not going into an o.r. with an open wound .
you need to get yourself tested and run an infectious panel ,
including rapid h.i.v. on him
and whoever &apos;s blood was in his mouth .
hold up .
is that a ...
tooth .
one ...
down .
what ?
say &quot; trick or treat . &quot;
no .
god , you &apos;re no fun sometimes .
trick or treat . what ?
a treat for you .
well , first of all , the x @-@ rays are backwards .
no , they &apos;re not . the organs are .
no way .
mm @-@ hmm .
he has situs inversus ?
all his organs are completely backwards ,
mirrored to the normal position .
this guy was shot twice in the chest .
he didn &apos;t die . murphy could barely find a heartbeat ,
but it turns out his heart was on the other side .
i have wanted to see this since med school .
i know that .
happy halloween .
it started last night . she loves halloween .
she &apos;s been in this costume for days .
and i have to go out of town today for work .
last trip was brazil . i got to go , too .
and i couldn &apos;t take her with me on this one ,
so we had halloween early .
we watched part of a scary movie , and --
&quot; poltergeist . &quot; it was awesome .
i paged dr. robbins .
no , you paged peds . you got me .
taryn , i &apos;m dr. karev . so , uh , you have a stomachache .
you don &apos;t know any magic spells to fix it ?
no . well , we had some candy last night during the movie ,
and she got sick ... a few times .
candy for dinner . nice .
all right , she has some guarding and a fever ,
so it &apos;s probably not the candy .
i &apos;d like to do further testing . draw labs .
i still get to trick @-@ or @-@ treat , right ?
are you kidding ? the best trick @-@ or @-@ treating in seattle
is right here on the peds floor .
you go around with these huge pillowcases .
everyone hands out as much candy as you can carry .
he didn &apos;t die .
they shot him in the heart twice , and he didn &apos;t die .
i thought he was just crazy .
he was just crazy .
then why didn &apos;t he die ? !
i &apos;ve got a needle right next to your face .
i need you to calm it down , okay ?
is there any pain elsewhere ?
it &apos;s just sore .
and stiff .
oh , my god .
is this rigor mortis ?
victor , zombies aren &apos;t real . we know this , right ?
you . you should ...
qua @-@ quarantine ...
victor , squeeze my hand .
did you hit your head when he attacked you ?
you should quarantine --
can you smile for me , buddy ?
uh ... no , he &apos;s having a stroke .
there &apos;s pulsatile mass . could be damage to the carotid .
maybe a pseudoaneurysm .
all right , get the ultrasound .
i &apos;m gonna book an o.r.
mrs. wiltern ?
uh , walker . marge walker .
take me home , philip .
mom ? uh , sorry . she &apos;s a little afraid of hospitals .
oh . well , in that case , i &apos;ll be very , very gentle , okay ?
uh , it says you hurt your leg ?
she says it was a bug bite or something . it got infected ,
and she says it hurts like heck .
she &apos;s been popping ibuprofen like it &apos;s candy .
i had to drag her in here .
it &apos;s fine . philip , take me home .
mom , no . not until you let her check it out .
just try to relax , okay ?
i &apos;m gonna take a look .
uh ... when did this happen ?
about four months ago .
four months ago ?
maggots .
gross . writhing and pulsing .
we know what maggots are .
at first , they were a little bit blurry
because my eyes -- i just had eye surgery .
what ? what ? what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m fine .
you shouldn &apos;t be seeing patients .
but i wanna be helpful .
well , great . then you can go to the store
and buy some halloween candy .
name brands -- none of those smartees or candy corns .
but i &apos;m not supposed to drive .
luckily , someone invented the bus pass .
come on , grey . you &apos;re not gonna make her take the bus .
thank you , dr. torres .
there &apos;s a shop just up the street . you can walk .
you &apos;re looking for what again ?
you know , one of those little head mirrors ,
that doctors wear .
ben , you are a doctor .
have you ever worn one ?
no .
because they stopped using them a century ago .
what are they teaching you down there ?
tuck wants to be a mad scientist tonight .
he should have one of those little head mirror things .
well , i have a brain in a jar .
but i wanna give him a costume , not a nightmare .
what did he do to you ?
torres and i are working on thought control prosthetics .
i &apos;m trying to figure out a way to insert the sensors
through a smaller craniotomy .
ohh . you should be ashamed of yourself .
i &apos;m sorry ? oh , well , that &apos;s for zola tonight .
it was ripped . i fixed it .
yeah , if you call this fixed .
yeah , i could do a running whipstitch so smooth
the butterfly would never even know there &apos;d been a rupture .
what are you teaching up here ?
i would like to take a biopsy
to see if the infection &apos;s gotten into the bone .
and we are gonna need to take you down to the o.r.
to clean the parasites out of that wound .
no ! no ! take me home !
mom .
take me home !
no , no , no . mom . mom . mom .
we--we can give you a sedative to ease the anxiety .
no ! no needles ! no needles ! just go away !
just leave me alone ! don &apos;t ! just go away ! don &apos;t--oh !
she &apos;s always hated doctors ,
but it &apos;s gotten out of control since my dad died .
i don &apos;t want to sound cruel ,
but can &apos;t you just put her in restraints
and give her a sedative or something ?
well ... i have an idea .
i &apos;m going to the gift shop . i &apos;ll be back .
uh , put her in bed 3 . get an x @-@ ray of the ankle .
bed 5 should be empty .
get a rapid influenza .
could be the flu .
right away , doctor .
uh , ma &apos;am ?
i &apos;m waiting for my doctor .
well , i &apos;m your doctor now , so ...
what &apos;s your doctor &apos;s name ? maybe i can find them .
dr. brooks .
heather brooks .
i &apos;m sorry . she &apos;s not here .
yes , she is .
she &apos;s always here .
she said she &apos;ll only see heather brooks .
can i tell her about heather ?
you wanna tell a sick old lady
her favorite doctor is dead ?
that seem like a good idea to you ?
no . it &apos;s just , she &apos;s pretty insistent on seeing dr. brooks .
then tell her it &apos;s not possible and treat her yourself .
um ... where is she ?
i don &apos;t know . she was right there a second ago .
uh , murphy &apos;s bitten , edwards is blind ,
and you &apos;re bonkers .
no ! i--
another one down .
holy ...
ma &apos;am , i &apos;d like to get you started on medication .
i need to know your name so we can get you registered .
no , i &apos;ll-- i &apos;ll wait for doctor--
dr. brooks isn &apos;t here . i am .
just tell me your name .
if you don &apos;t , i &apos;ll have to go through all dr. brooks &apos; charts .
how about you save me all that trouble and tell me your name ?
she &apos;ll come .
okay , i &apos;m tracking one of the bullets
through the accessory lobe .
that &apos;s the middle lobe .
right . right .
it &apos;s the right lung .
this is like ... driving in england .
you know , i had to keep thinking about every move that i make .
it &apos;s gonna take twice as long as it should .
okay .
you got plans tonight ?
meredith semi @-@ invited me to this babyfest tonight .
but i can &apos;t tell if she really wants me to go
or if she just felt she had to ask .
it &apos;s so complicated .
right ?
she and i just used to know what the other one was thinking .
i meant this .
there &apos;s still bleeding in the upper lobe .
i need more proximal control .
duval lung clamp .
straight vascular clamp , please .
okay . oh , watch out for the s.--
s.v.c.
nicked the s.v.c. it shouldn &apos;t even be there !
i got you this so you don &apos;t have to shut your eyes so tight .
and you don &apos;t have to see . you wanna try it ?
here .
so let &apos;s forget we &apos;re in a hospital .
let &apos;s talk about halloween .
do you get a lot of kids at your house ?
no .
oh . too bad .
all the kids in the neighborhood are philip &apos;s age .
they &apos;re all grown up and gone .
but when he was little ...
it was nuts .
a real madhouse , huh ?
yeah , kids everywhere .
philip loved it---his favorite holiday .
he always needed a costume they didn &apos;t sell in the stores ....
and i always needed to make it .
what &apos;s happening ?
it &apos;s okay . we &apos;re just , uh , we &apos;re gonna take a little walk .
we &apos;re gonna go down to the o.r. and get you a gown .
is that okay ?
yeah . yeah , fine .
it &apos;s okay. it &apos;s gonna be okay .
so ... you made all his costumes from scratch , huh ?
what did he go as ?
well , one year , he went as an aardvark .
taryn &apos;s labs show a slightly elevated white count ,
and some of her electrolytes are off .
is she gonna be here overnight ?
it &apos;s just that her dad wants to know
if he should change his flight .
yeah , his 8 @-@ year @-@ old has a potentially surgical abdomen .
she needs a c.t. she &apos;s in pain . he should change his flight .
dude , what is your problem ?
i know you think he &apos;s an ass , but he &apos;s not .
he &apos;s not your dad .
don &apos;t even--
what ?
pretend that you &apos;re not angry and hurt and about to explode ?
i &apos;ve been doing that . it &apos;s not working .
tell me what i can do to make this better .
just get a c.t.
so i thought the second one would be easier ,
but it &apos;s just like having one all over again ,
except now there are two .
so you &apos;re twice as exhausted .
okay , we &apos;re all set .
okay . okay , marge , we &apos;re in the o.r.
and we are ready to operate .
you &apos;ll be here the whole time , meredith ?
the whole time .
okay . yes .
i &apos;m ready .
okay .
you know , if you segmented the wings ,
then she &apos;d flap when she moved .
she just has to look like a butterfly .
she doesn &apos;t actually have to fly .
how &apos;d you swing the time off ?
you know , i , uh , i just made it happen .
halloween was always my favorite night as a kid ,
and i just wanted to spend it with my family , you know ?
you &apos;re so domesticated .
you &apos;re suturing a butterfly costume .
you know , uh ...
you know , if we attach this to her wrist with strings ,
it &apos;d sort of fan out .
that &apos;s a brilliant idea .
right . it &apos;s totally worth it .
yeah , keep stitching .
they &apos;re incompetent . it &apos;s not their fault ,
because it &apos;s how they were raised .
these days , parents think all of their kids are geniuses .
and everyone gets a trophy just for being on the soccer team .
and--
they &apos;re not the problem .
you are .
i &apos;m trying to teach them , and you won &apos;t let them learn .
i can barely get out of this bed .
i can &apos;t operate .
who knows if i ever will ?
the only thing that gives me some meaning .
hell , some days the only thing that keeps me going ...
is teaching them .
and--and you &apos;re standing in the way of that .
so i &apos;m gonna have someone else supervise &apos; em .
you &apos;re not kicking me off this case .
yes , i am .
this is why when i fire someone ,
i like to do it in their office .
so i can walk out .
walk out , bailey .
now .
wow , there is barely any necrotic tissue here .
the maggots might have actually saved her leg .
well , remind me to send them flowers .
we may actually make trick @-@ or @-@ treating tonight .
yeah , about that--i &apos;m , uh ... i &apos;m bowing out tonight .
arizona and i can &apos;t be in the same room
for more than five minutes before everything devolves
into gunfire and screaming .
sofia has been so excited about halloween .
i &apos;m not about to let her mommies &apos; bickering ruin it .
so ... taking one for the team .
are you sure ? there &apos;s gonna be a pinata ...
shut up .
and pin the head on the skeleton .
damn it ! they &apos;re so cute when they &apos;re blindfolded .
bobbing for apples .
they &apos;re even cuter when they bob !
i &apos;ll take pictures .
dr. grey , it &apos;s dr. webber .
he &apos;s asking whether you have room on your schedule
for a cystogastrostomy .
maybe derek can take pictures .
did you get your labs back ?
nope .
the post exposure counselor
gave me this cheerful little pamphlet
on anti @-@ viral drugs to read while i &apos;m waiting .
she said in case i do have h.i.v. ,
it might not be a bad idea to start taking them now .
you probably don &apos;t have h.i.v.
i might .
i might never see again .
you probably will . my uncle can .
you said he &apos;s in constant pain . horrible pain .
he had to give up his accounting practice .
he can &apos;t do math .
i &apos;m not gonna be able to be a surgeon anymore .
the counselor said
there are plenty of other health care jobs available apart from surgery .
like what ?
like post @-@ exposure counseling .
but i won &apos;t know which pamphlets to hand out
if i can &apos;t read them .
we &apos;re screwed .
so screwed .
that &apos;s one jacked up carotid .
yeah , let &apos;s go ahead and prep the synthetic graft .
okay . starting it now .
it &apos;s yours , dr. avery ...
from dr. edwards .
she wants to know if you think she should
call the ... lasagna pleasant ?
that &apos;s , like , her 15th misspelled text .
she &apos;s scared .
tell her not to call , everything &apos;s gonna be fine ,
and to keep using her eyedrops .
you know what ? and tell her that she &apos;s beautiful .
what ?
who are you ?
you were never that nice to me when i would spin out .
well , maybe ...
i am trying to be a better boyfriend now .
no , no , it helped that you were an ass .
it made me get my act together .
i &apos;m gettin &apos; married ,
and i &apos;m saving this guy &apos;s life and his face .
and that &apos;s all because of me .
damn it .
i mean this was supposed to be fun , you know ?
you &apos;re overcomplicating it .
just tell your left hand to do
what your right hand usually does .
haven &apos;t you practiced operating with both hands ?
yeah .
upside down , underwater--
i @-@ i pra--
in a straight jacket .
yes , i have practiced with both hands ,
but i can &apos;t just-- cut .
see ?
simple .
i &apos;m sorry . i can &apos;t do it .
meredith , i just need you to observe while a--
i understand what you &apos;re asking me--
meredith .
page the general surgeon that &apos;s on call .
i don &apos;t have the time .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry for saying that you were the wrong choice
to be in charge of my care ,
for saying that you should have let me die .
i &apos;m sorry for ever feeling that way .
because i &apos;ve remembered what it is to live for .
i would have never gotten here if it hadn &apos;t been for you .
so i &apos;m sorry .
meredith , please . help me teach them .
what is that , a fan ?
yeah , exactly . the array is a fan .
now if i can get the fan to go in through a burr hole
and open up under the skull ,
the whole area would be covered
with a fraction of the exposure .
how has no one ever thought of this yet ?
how have i never thought of this yet ?
you don &apos;t look like you &apos;re regretting
stepping back from surgery at all .
it &apos;s only been a week , but , uh , no .
what &apos;s the rush ?
i got the kid &apos;s c.t.
you wanna fill me in ?
adrenal glands are enlarged ,
coupled with high potassium , low glucose--
adrenal insufficiency .
her body &apos;s not producing enough adrenaline ?
i &apos;m glad you can read .
but there &apos;s no tumor .
unless it &apos;s an infection ,
maybe blastomycosis .
oh , god , her-- her dad mentioned
that they just went to brazil .
what , are you kidding me ?
you didn &apos;t think you should put that in her chart ?
what the hell ?
thanks for your help , and i &apos;m sorry
about the last @-@ minute cancellation .
where is she ?
she was just here .
she was asking about trick or treating around the hospital ,
and i just stepped out
to change my flight--
you couldn &apos;t keep an eye on her for five minutes ?
what &apos;s--what &apos;s going on ?
taryn &apos;s body isn &apos;t producing adrenaline .
you know what adrenaline does ?
it keeps your organs from going into shock and shutting down
when you get hurt or traumatized or scared .
you said that she started to feel sick last night
watching the scary movie ?
she wanted to watch it .
she &apos;s wandering through the hospital on halloween .
look , if-- if something frightens her ,
she could go into shock .
she can get scared ... to death ?
we gotta go find her .
i &apos;m looking for a crazy lady with weird eyes .
too soon , shane .
no , seriously , she disappeared again .
she was heather &apos;s patient , and she won &apos;t tell me her name .
and there &apos;s no record of her anywhere ,
every time i go to find her , she &apos;s gone .
whoa ... well , maybe she &apos;s a ghost .
forget it .
stop . she &apos;s probably a stray .
heather was always taking them in--
the ... the homeless , the uninsured .
trick or treat .
trick or treat .
get me d @-@ 10 normal saline
and bring a crash cart right away !
i &apos;ll get it .
taryn , can you hear me ?
dr. karev ?
give me that gurney !
right away , doctor .
she &apos;s in shock from adrenal crisis .
get me her blood pressure ,
and get those fluids started .
i &apos;m on it .
let &apos;s get her legs elevated .
expiratory wheezing , get her on 5 @-@ liter o2 .
systolic &apos;s 15 .
i need an i.v. hydrocortisone and a central line kit .
have the p.i.c.u. get a bed ready ,
and get her to the e.r.
right away .
this doesn &apos;t look like a hospital .
we &apos;ve taken all of
the unnecessary medical equipment out of the room .
and philip is bringing some more of your things from home .
and i &apos;ve even put a sign on the door ,
so all the doctors and staff will respect your privacy .
do you want me to stay ?
don &apos;t you have kids to get to for halloween ?
yeah , but you-- you know , it &apos;s okay . i &apos;m--
oh , no . you don &apos;t want to miss it .
you only get ten before they go off
on halloween with their friends , getting into trouble .
you gotta enjoy it while you can .
that wasn &apos;t so bad , was it ?
yeah , and you can make it to your party ,
if you you &apos;re going .
i am . you know , i &apos;ll show up .
i &apos;ll have a beer . mer and i will talk ,
and we &apos;ll move past this whole thing .
good .
oh , it &apos;s meredith .
&quot; if you &apos;re coming to the party , could you bring cupcakes ?
if not , no problem . &quot;
what does that mean ?
um ... it &apos;s no problem if i don &apos;t go ,
or no problem if i don &apos;t bring cupcakes ?
and if i don &apos;t go , then there &apos;s no cupcakes ?
or will someone else bring them ?
and if someone else is bringing them ,
why is she even asking me ?
don &apos;t overcomplicate it .
just go .
the cortisone will prevent another adrenal crisis .
taryn should make a full recovery .
i never would have taken her to brazil with me
if i had known she could get sick .
i know .
and the movie ... she loves scary movies .
it ... it was one bad call .
that &apos;s all it was , just one bad call .
i &apos;m a good dad .
don &apos;t let what dr. karev said ...
he &apos;s just ...
he &apos;s so good with kids
but just so crappy with other people .
he knows you &apos;re a good dad .
is my face fixed ?
not quite yet . our first priority
was repairing your injured carotid ,
which was damaged when you were attacked .
oh , god . the zombie--where is he ?
no .
he &apos;s--he &apos;s not quarantined ? is that where this is ?
i ... i &apos;ve been quarantined , haven &apos;t i ?
oh , god , i knew it .
i saw this thing on cable about these rituals in haiti ,
and i thought they were all crap ,
but you &apos;ve got me quarantined .
except you &apos;re not quarantined .
which means ...
this is the i.c.u.
you wouldn &apos;t tell me the truth anyway .
they &apos;ve got you on a gag order , don &apos;t they ?
because that &apos;s what they do--the c.d.c.
okay .
they--they don &apos;t want you to tell me the truth .
hey , victor ! victor , hey !
because otherwise , you--
hey , hey ! listen to me !
victor , you are not under quarantine .
you are in the i.c.u. ,
which is where we take patients after surgery .
you were attacked by a normal guy
who took a bunch of drugs , lost his mind , and attacked you .
he didn &apos;t die when he was shot
because he &apos;s got a condition called situs inversus ,
which put his heart on the opposite side of his chest .
that &apos;s ... that &apos;s random .
yeah , completely random ,
and also not in the least bit supernatural .
and really , honestly , when you think about it ,
isn &apos;t that , like , a hundred times scarier
than some ... zombie apocalypse ?
yeah .
yeah , okay , i guess it is .
see , someone starts spinning out ,
you just shut it down .
but , you know , you can still tell him he &apos;s pretty ,
if you want to .
fix the wings ?
yes , and changed the future of science .
i figured out the sensor array .
i insert it into a 2 @-@ centimeter burr hole .
great !
well , i have to find a resident to do webber &apos;s pseudocyst ,
or i &apos;m not even gonna make it to trick or treat .
go . see you at the house .
okay .

dr. mahoney to the e.r.

let &apos;s go , shane . suit up . big leagues .
i ...

yes , i know a place we can go
where no one will interrupt us .
trick or treat !
hey , kids , slow down !
becca , hurry !
oh , my goodness .
welcome to my laboratory .
it &apos;s great .
mommy , ben did all this .
look , there &apos;s even smoke !
oh , i see !
well , i @-@ i had some help .
well , look at you .
dr. crazy person .
you look so good !
okay , go and get your trick or treat bag now .
i told you , this is my holiday .
you are amazing .
he &apos;s so happy .
we had fun . you know , we should do stuff like this all the time .
yeah , he &apos;d love that .
i would , too .
right ?
i mean , this holidays and weekends crap--
i want to be back here in seattle with you guys .
yeah , i know .
but , well , you can &apos;t drop out of residency
in the middle .
in a few years , we &apos;ll--
i did .
i quit .
you what ?
hey , have you seen wilson ?
&apos;cause i need to get an update on--
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing &apos;s wrong . i &apos;m fine .
you &apos;re crying .
it &apos;s nothing . i &apos;m fine .
i got bit ...
by a delusional , psychotic drug addict
who think he &apos;s the undead .
and i &apos;m waiting for the guy &apos;s h.i.v. results .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
i &apos;m trying to be easy peasy .
my first needle stick happened on a tuesday .
it was the second month of my third year
in my internal medicine rotation .
and my patient was suffering from end stage a.i.d.s.
we had just switched over to these retractable needles .
and when i went to put his into the hazardous waste , i ...
i didn &apos;t retract it right .
and it jammed right into my palm .
and my whole body went cold .
and i had never felt fear like that in my whole life .
right now ...
it &apos;s not the time to be easy peasy .
she &apos;s dead .
dr. brooks died three months ago .
well , that can &apos;t be true .
you &apos;re not in the charts .
she was treating you under the table , right ?
she was giving you these ...
for your asthma ?
i didn &apos;t want her to get into trouble .
when you run out ,
you come back . you find me .
i &apos;ll be your doctor now .
she--she was a very good doctor .
are you as good as she was ?
no .
but i will be .
so there &apos;s the wall of the pseudocyst .
now what do you do ?
enlarge the incision with a dissecting instrument
and use a stapler to create the anastomosis .
good . carry on .
faster ... but take your time .
can i tell you a thing about alex ?
he doesn &apos;t want me to tell anyone ,
but i don &apos;t know what to do .
he keeps pushing me away ,
and you know him better than i do .
can &apos;t tell me .
i can &apos;t ?
telling me is the worst thing you could do .
if he told you , he trusted you .
so whatever it is ,
you have to be the one to deal with it .
i mean , of course he &apos;s gonna to push you away
because he hates being vulnerable .
but that &apos;s when he &apos;s gonna need you
to stick with him the most .
i &apos;ll keep trying .
we &apos;ll , you &apos;re gonna have to do better than try ,
because my plate is full .
i have too many kids and too many patients ,
and i can &apos;t handle a broken alex right now .
you can do it .
is it out of the question
to get a little consistency in this family ?
what consistency ? i never see you .
trick or treat !
oh , trick or treat .
look at you . you &apos;re so scary .
here .
thank you .
you started the program--
no , you upended our lives
because it was extremely important to you .
it &apos;s not working .
you are my family , and i want to be with you .
trick or treat !
oh , cleopatra and a ladybug .
thank you .
trick or treat !
my life is happening , and i &apos;m elsewhere .
you don &apos;t love it ?
you ? of course i l--
no , not me . surgery .
you left town a week after we got married
to learn surgery , because ...
you were in love with it .
yeah . but i am in love with you more .
you really gonna tell me that &apos;s the wrong answer ?
i &apos;m j @-@ just ...
what ?
miranda , what ?
disappointed ...
in you .
can we go trick @-@ or @-@ treating now ?
you are so cute !
okay . uh , let me get my coat .
this is emma marling .
please leave a message .
emma , owen .
uh , listen , um ...
i wasn &apos;t ready to talk about cristina before ,
because things between she and i were always so ... complicated .
and i can &apos;t ... i can &apos;t do complicated right now .
i don &apos;t even want to think about complicated ,
and that is what is so great about you ,
is that you &apos;re , you know , you &apos;re so easy .
god ... that came out wrong . i don &apos;t mean you &apos;re easy .
i mean you &apos;re simple .
uh ... uh , delete this .
emma ?
hi .
how &apos;d she do ?
fantastic .
almost as if she had a great teacher .
take me through it . i want to hear every detail .
well , in the interest of education ,
why don &apos;t we let dr. wilson do that ?
i like the way you think , grey .
okay , well , um , we started your incision using--
no , no . start from the very beginning .
where &apos;d you place the ports ?
well , um , we took a look at your previous incision
and decided to place the xiphoid port lateral to that .
halloween is not for the faint of heart .
there &apos;s a surprise around every corner .
rapid tests negative !
good for you .
i have to go back in six months
to get tested again to be sure ,
but it &apos;s looking good .
what &apos;s wrong ? you still blind ?
bummer .
also , no hepatitis .
what are you doing here ?
dude , i &apos;m waiting for my boyfr--
jackson ?
oh , damn it .
ooh , i &apos;m screwed ! i &apos;m so screwed .
i really might never operate again ,
and it &apos;s my fault .
i went and had surgery on my eyes
because my glasses were just a little bit annoying ,
and then i went back to work too soon
because i thought i might get a little bit behind ,
which is so stupid .
yeah . pretty stupid .
what ?
you knew that i was gonna take
the whole day off with you , right ?
we could have spent the entire day at home
on the couch while i made you chicken soup
and you watched movies and slept it off .
but , no , you had to come to work .
you had to stress yourself out and strain your eyes
and make yourself miserable ,
which i told you was gonna happen .
can we do it tomorrow ?
we &apos;re gonna do it right damn now .
come on .
some of the surprises are good .
hey ! you made it .
the party was great ,
and sofia is a champion apple @-@ bobber .
the wings look great !
look at the little space princess !
hey ! go to mommy .
i don &apos;t hear any gunfire .
yeah , well , we &apos;ll only get about ten of these
before she starts wanting to wear slutty costumes
and i &apos;m not about to cut that number in half .
it &apos;s the first thing arizona and i have agreed on in months .
who &apos;s ready to go trick @-@ or @-@ treating ?
time for blast @-@ off !
all right , let &apos;s go !
and some of the surprises are bad .
are you gonna stay here and hand out candy ?
no , i &apos;m gonna eat candy in the dark
and pretend like i &apos;m not home .
alex--
i &apos;ll pass out your freakin &apos; candy . relax .
what &apos;s important is that
you can &apos;t let the fear of the surprise
stop you from getting dressed up ...
and wandering up to a stranger &apos;s house
to ask the question .
what are you supposed to be ?
sexy ...
witch .
you didn &apos;t have something else to do tonight ?
i had many options , sharky ...
but this seemed the most fun .
can i buy you a drink ?
tequila .
two tequilas .
lights are off !
i was wrong about your dad .
i made a bad call .
i should have let you walk away ,
but i never would have pushed you towards him
if i thought that you &apos;d end up hurt .
i didn &apos;t see it coming .
you did , and i am so sorry .
but it was one crappy call .
that &apos;s all .
so what &apos;ll it be--
trick ...
or treat ?
get in , before the trick @-@ or @-@ treaters
