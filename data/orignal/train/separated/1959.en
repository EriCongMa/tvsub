You're late.
I know.
She's worried.
Well, I'm here now.
In trauma, we're concerned with one overriding question...
...how did this happen?
I didn't want you to see me yet.
I know.
Tatiana, you look...
so beautiful.
What was the mechanism of injury?
How do we see past the mess and confusion of the trauma
to figure out what the damage actually is?
Infinite possibilities
put the patient on the table in front of you.
Now you have to figure out -- will they live?
Will you be able to save them?
Or are they a lost cause?
No shared assets, no children,
and, of course, there's a solid post-nuptial agreement in place.
With nothing to contest, it's just about signing the papers.
The places to initial and sign
are all clearly marked.
Red tabs for initials, blue tabs for signatures.
Every part of a trauma
tells a different piece of the story.
This is one of the simpler divorces
I've seen, actually.
And until you look at
each and every injury...
So, what are you gonna do? You gonna sign the papers?
We have to push, and we have to fight.
I'm not sure we are worth fighting for.
...you can't see what went wrong.
At work?
That's where you decide to do this?!
You want to lower your voice?
What does it matter how loud my voice is
when 35 people just saw me get served with divorce papers
in the middle of the emergency room?!
I am sorry about that, all right?
That was not supposed to happen.
He was supposed to talk to you after you were done with work.
It's only been four weeks. Four, Jackson.
Is that -- that's all the counseling
you could handle before bailing?
You said you wanted to try!
We did try.
It didn't work. It didn't get us anywhere.
We have the same exact fight over and over again,
Around in circles.
I'm telling you -- it's not working.
Then why are we even bothering with counseling?!
What is the point of counseling
If you're just gonna suddenly, without even talking, just --
Oh, come on. All we do is talk, April.
So, what? You just -- you just serve me papers?
Just like that?
Do you have any idea what a slap in the face this is?
How long?!
How long have I been sitting on a couch
discussing my marriage
with someone who has already checked out?
That's not what I was doing.
No, I just want to know when it happened.
When did you decide that you were done?
She didn't say that.
Yeah, she did.
When did she say that?
She's been saying it for three weeks now.
We shouldn't be having sex.
I hardly think our sex life is our problem.
I don't think it's a problem.
It just -- it gets in the way.
In the way of what?
You're just hearing what you want to hear.
I'm hearing what our therapist is telling us,
and you're not.
It's like we're sitting in on two completely different sessions.
That's just offensive.
What's offensive is you keep choosing to ignore --
I'm not ignoring anything!
See? You can't ever take responsibility.
You never apologize for anything.
I apologize all the time.
Not for the things that matter.
What do I have to apologize for, Jackson?
I am here, and I'm trying.
I want to make this work.
Stop! Will you just -- don't touch it.
Sorry.
Now, remember, once we remove these bandages,
there's gonna be some -- some redness, some swelling.
So...did you talk to April last night?
I did.
And? How'd it go?
Not, uh -- not exactly as I expected.
Oh, god. She took it that hard?
Or she didn't because...
you didn't ask her, did you?
Tatiana.
You're kidding me.
It's really not that simple.
Sure, it is.
You just say, "This isn't working for me anymore.
I'm not happy. I want a divorce."
Knock, knock!
Well, you ready for the unveiling?
Four years' hard work, Avery.
Well, I'm just the surgeon.
Tatiana's had the hardest job.
This guy. Always sweet-talking.
43 surgeries, 4 years,
3 months, 1 week, and 4 days.
Can't believe this is the last time
you'll be unwrapping my face.
Okay.
Let's do it.
Wait. I'm...
I don't think I'll be able to look.
Hey, what kind of hack do you think I am?
You are going to want to see this.
Trust me.
How's meredith?
She's good, considering it's her first week of recovery.
Good.
What are you up to?
You're just...
You're so...
Remember how our therapist said that we should be more direct
with what we want?
Maybe you should be more direct with what you want.
I have an hour
until my I&D case.
I'm heading to the on-call room...
take a little nap.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Too bad you won't be getting any sleep.
I don't want to talk, because you know what?
I know what you're gonna say!
You're gonna say "You love me, but"!
You don't know what I'm going to say!
Oh, I'm pretty sure I do. It doesn't matter! You don't!
Fine! Fine. Then just go ahead.
Come -- say it.
Oh, my god, Jackson!
God! Please! Would you just say it?!
You're right. I was.
I was gonna ask you for a divorce
when we went for dinner.
And then again when we stayed in for dinner... yeah.
...and then things happened.
Yeah, well, we had sex, Jackson.
That's what happened. We had sex.
I was clear about this.
My mind was made up.
I knew what was best for me -- moving forward,
no matter how hard.
I knew there were things that we couldn't repair.
I knew what I had to do.
And it's not clear for me anymore.
This -- when I look at you and I stop thinking...
When I let myself just be with you...
All I'm saying is, I don't think
that I want what I wanted anymore.
And what I want...
What?
I want you.
You guys had sex. Yeah, we did, too.
It's messy.
Stop running away from me.
Callie, you and arizona, before you guys split,
you did the counseling thing, right?
I mean, an hour wait for a table?
It's ridiculous. I'm hungry now.
This was such a better idea.
Place looks nice.
Changed some things around, huh?
Some new pillows.
I like those.
No, you don't. You hate throw pillows.
I really do.
Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry. You want something to drink?
Yeah.
Oh, my god.
They gave us so many fortune cookies.
I love fortune cookies!
I know. I asked for extra.
I'm sorry again about last night getting cut short.
I get it. It's okay. It's fine.
Yeah, I know.
And...
Look at that.
Amen.
Thank you for waiting.
You want to know what I was praying for?
No, that's all right.
Throw pillows.
Thousands of them just raining from the sky.
I do not understand their purpose.
They have so many purposes.
They don't. They just...
They're like a pop of color.
get in the way.
I just don't understand what the...
You, like, prop up your arms and your feet.
moving them around the house.
Plus, it looks nice.
You're funny.
It's good, right?
It's really good.
Told you you'd like this place.
I can't believe I never noticed it.
I probably ordered takeout every night while you were gone.
And I didn't realize this place was right around the corner.
Okay.
What?
We just sat down to eat.
I-I thought we were having a nice time.
We are.
So why are you gonna ruin it by picking a fight?
No, I'm not.
I wasn't picking a fight. I was just talking Chinese food.
And Jordan.
And takeout.
I am not the one getting defensive.
And I am?
Look...
I did not come here to fight tonight.
Okay.
Okay?
Okay.
So, why did you come here?
Throw pillows, obviously.
I saw you had a, um, nasal septum reconstruction
up on the board today. Is that for Tatiana?
Uh, yeah. Her final surgery.
She's come such a long way. You should be so proud.
I am.
I mean, I-I will be once it all kind of comes together.
I've performed so many surgeries on her, you know,
that her face is just this road map, you know,
of an incredible journey that we've been on together.
I'm rambling. I'll stop.
We really should talk, though.
We are talking.
Yeah, I mean...
really talk.
About us.
Obviously it's not easy, you know?
I do think it's right.
If you're struggling this much,
maybe that should tell you something.
Maybe you should stop before you say whatever it is --
We need to talk about getting a divorce.
April...
Okay.
Come on. Don't --
We're not even living together.
Okay, this is the first substantial conversation
we've had in, what, months?
Well, that is your choice and not mine,
'cause I've been here.
I've been willing to have any conversation.
Don't do that.
Don't blame me.
I'm not blaming you.
It's not blame. It's just fact.
I want to talk to you,
but we're having two different conversations
'cause I want to work on things and you just want to end them.
I'm not being flip about any of this.
You actually believe that I'm taking this lightly?
It just seems like you are looking for an excuse
to walk away instead of putting in any of the work --
You left me!
You walked away!
You -- you ran halfway across the world! How co--
'Cause I was dying, Jackson!
塞缪尔 died, and I died!
Until Jordan, until I was able go over there and --
And what?
You think I was somehow just fine after samuel
You don't think I was dying, too?
No. No, okay?
You weren't. Not like me.
You were coping.
You -- you were okay.
I couldn't even...
And then I found something.
I found something over there that I needed so badly!
And I thought that you understood that!
I wasn't coping.
I was covering.
For you. I was...
to take care of you.
And now you're punishing me over and over
because I dared to take things into my own hands
because I recognized the spiral I was falling into,
and I went and did something about it?
I was putting you first.
That's what you do in a marriage!
Or I guess that's not what you do.
I don't -- I took care of myself so that I would survive!
And all that does is make you angry.
Look at you.
What...
What is it, Jackson?
What -- what pisses you off so much --
that I chose to go after the thing that I needed to heal
or that the thing I needed wasn't you?
The thing that I needed was you!
I survived.
You survived.
But I do not think we can survive this.
No, I'm not getting divorced, Jackson, okay?
No one in my family has ever been divorced.
Everyone in my family has.
Sometimes marriages just don't work out.
It's not just the harder thing sometimes.
Maybe sometimes it's healthier.
I'm not giving up on us. I won't.
You already did.
My god!
Stop saying that!
You take for granted
that I'm just gonna wait for you,
and wait and wait, no matter what!
But divorce is not some dirty word, April, not for me.
In fact, right now,
it's a light at the end of a really dark tunnel.
What are you doing?
Really?
That's what this has been to you?
Oh, I'm so sorry I kept you locked away in this prison camp!
You just want to end it, huh?
Is that what you're saying?
That's not what I said.
You just want to pretend like this -- - Well, what are you saying?
You would know if you would listen!
I am listening!
What are you doing?
I'm throwing cookies!
Why?!
Because!
Because why?
I don't know!
You're being ridiculous! Stop!
I know!
Stop.
I know!
What...
what is happening to us?
I don't...know.
How did we get to this?
I don't know.
How do we make it stop?
Wait.
Wait.
What?
We should... probably not do this.
Probably not -- not a good idea.
No. Yeah, absolutely.
It's not a good idea.
All right.
You know what they call that? Divorce.
And it wasn't an ultimatum. I gave you a choice.
Where's my maxillofacial consult?
On the way.
G.C.S. is 9.
Pupils are asymmetric. We need to establish an airway.
What do you got?
He fell 20 feet.
C6-7 unstable fracture.
He's breathing on his own, but he needs a secure airway.
Okay. Laryngoscope, please.
Wait. Why are you here?
Airway. You paged me.
I thought you were going to the airport,
flying to Jordan with April.
Yeah. N-no.
Um, yeah, I decided not to go, actually.
Uh, scope, please.
Is this flight 2703 to Jordan?
I need to get on that plane.
I'm sorry, sir,
but once the doors are officially closed,
there's really noth--
Please, okay?
My wife's on that flight.
I just need to get to my wife, so if you could just --
Oh, my god. That is so sweet.
So you'll open the doors?
No.
Are you kidding me right now?
I'm sorry.
There's nothing I can do.
Your plane's leaving.
What?
What the hell do you mean
that Owen's not gonna be there with you?
I'm not gonna be there alone.
There's a whole unit of us.
We work together. We're -- we're friends.
I mean, we're more than that. We're like family.
We have each other's backs. We get each other.
Like I don't get you, right?
Come with me. Come on.
I-it's not too late. I can make a couple phone calls.
No.
We always need more surgeons over there.
April, no. My answer hasn't changed.
If you could just see what it's like over there,
The work we do.
It's important.
It's immediate. It's essential.
There's no filter.
There's no time to even...
So often around here,
we, like, walk through life
And get caught up with all this stuff.
There's no stuff over there.
Every day, every patient has purpose.
It has meaning.
I-I want you to know it the way that I know it.
And I can't just pick up and go.
I have commitments.
I have people.
Who? Who?
What people do you have here
that would prevent you from coming overseas with me?
Patients.
I mean, I'm not willing
to just abandon people that depend on me.
And I am?
Kind of.
Kind of, yeah.
I'm still getting a lot of necrosis.
I'm afraid that
the stupid paramedian forehead flap is dying -- again.
This is the second one.
I do not know why this is happening.
I harvested two blood vessels this time
just to make sure that it wouldn't --
I was so careful to avoid clotting,
but it's still just...
I'm sorry. We'll figure this out.
This isn't your fault, you know.
Maybe my face just doesn't like forehead flaps.
You will figure this out.
You always do.
It's not like we haven't had setbacks before.
Yeah.
I know. It's just...
just crappy 'cause this one's happening right before Christmas
when your wife's off being some kind of superhero in a desert.
And, I mean...
I was around for what happened this time last year...
when you lost 塞缪尔.
And I know, well...
things have to be tough for you right now.
Come on! Just give me a signal! Just...
Damn it!
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
Come on!
Do you need more anesthetic?
No, I'm okay.
I heard you were down here.
What happened, baby?
It's nothing. It was just an accident at home.
Have you heard from April? Did she call you today?
She's busy over there, you know.
I mean, she probably doesn't even realize what day it is.
How can I help you?
What do you need?
You know, I could use more lidocaine with epi,
if you wouldn't mind.
I'll find some.
God!
It is so good to be back.
April. I'm -- I'm not working.
I'm -- I'm just -- I'm not ready to work yet.
I'm gonna head in to work.
You have breakfast?
You know, you haven't been to church in a while.
What do you say we go together?
Look at me, sweetheart.
What if we...
try again?
Let's try for another baby.
Why would you say that?
No, I just want --
What?!
What do you want?
April...
Screw you.
Screw you for even suggesting that.
Screw you.
Okay.
All right.
I'll go.
I'll just go in to work.
Get off of me!
Okay, just calm down. I know.
Get off!
Warren!
I was just marking her face for surgery.
That marker reeks! I don't
want it near my face!
All right, guys, uh...
She keeps trying to take off her bandages.
I'm not doing this anymore! I can't! I'm done!
All right, Warren, Wilson, give us a minute.
Hey, Tatiana, what is going on?
What is it?
I had a life before this!
I had a life!
Then I was in the wrong place at the wrong time,
and now my face is melted off of my face!
It's been a year and a half,
and there's so much more to go.
So many more surgeries!
And with each one, you get better.
This is my life now --
these walls, this bed, you!
I want it back.
I want it all back to who I was before.
I know.
I know.
Oh, hey. Good morning.
Hey, morning. Morning, sir. Yeah.
We're having a baby?
We're having a baby?
We're having a baby?
Ooh. Hey. What you doing?
We're dancing.
Dance.
Right on.
Right on.
Oh. Hi.
Hi.
Well, who died?
What?! Nobody.
We're just dancing.
I only dance it out when something bad happens.
Not today. - Did someone - Did I leave my --
Well, all right!
hey.
no.
What the hell?
Hey.
Hey!
Oh, all right. All right.
We celebrating the new baby?
What? Wait. What?
What did she say? Torres?
What -- what did you say?
Uh, well...
I'm so sorry.
We are actually celebrating a baby.
I am pregnant.
Oh, my god!
holy crap.
Congratulations.
Thank you!
Congratulations!
Thank you! Thank you!
Work it out.
It's one small concession.
It's not small.
Look, we are about to tell my parents
that we got married, eloped.
They wanted to be at my wedding.
They thought they were at my wedding.
I'm just not comfortable with it.
I mean, you know that.
I know that you're not religious.
So why are you asking me to lead your family in prayer?
Because they're predisposed to not like you.
You're marrying a rich, handsome surgeon.
Stop it. I know.
We embarrassed them.
And we will apologize for that.
Sincerely, okay?
But I'm not gonna change who I am
just to get your parents to like me.
No, no, no.
No, I don't want you to change who you are.
You want me to lie.
No. Come on.
It's -- it's a gesture of good faith.
My gesture of good faith
is being a wonderful husband to their beautiful daughter.
It's one day.
One prayer.
Not like I'm asking you to go get baptized.
I'm not.
Their first real impression of me.
What happens after at the holidays
when I'm suddenly not praying?
Well...
Are you kidding me? You --
Attention, ladies and gentlemen...
You want this to go on for how long exactly?
No, I just -- I just want them to like you and accept us.
Well, if you respect me, they will.
Jackson. Please. I -- - You know what? No.
April, this conversation's over.
Excuse me?
You knew who I was when we got married.
Okay? We talked about this.
We negotiated our whole wedding around it.
I thought that we agreed
that we would respect each other's differences.
So, yeah, for me, this conversation's over.
Just over?
Yeah. I'm done with it.
Maybe I didn't --
Maybe I didn't know who I was marrying.
Really? Okay.
Yeah, because you know what?
The way that you're speaking to me right now,
the way that you're acting, is not who I married.
Yeah, I could say the same thing.
You're right, because you know what?
We thought about it for all of like 18 hours.
What are you saying -- you wish we hadn't got married?
No.
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention?
We are now beginning our initial descent
into Port Columbus International Airport.
Please raise your tray tables
and place your seats in the upright position.
My parents are picking us up.
You want the rest of my peanuts?
I'm allergic to peanuts.
It looks like a lovely wedding.
Congratulations again.
She's a really... beautiful bride.
Hey, what's wrong? Are you feeling pain?
No. No. I'm not.
It's just...
Look at me.
I'm hideous.
No. Do not say that.
No one will ever look at me
the way you're looking at April in these pictures.
Tatiana, you're wrong.
Please.
Okay? I look at you,
and I see such incredible strength.
I see bravery.
I see humor and persistence...
Beauty.
Now, these surgeries, they're gonna give you back a face,
but don't you dare for a single moment
think that you're not already beautiful.
Oh, I can't believe we're doing this.
I can.
You may now kiss.
I know you think it's silly.
Well, I didn't say that.
But I'm serious, okay?
No premarital sex.
How serious? Like "Absolutely not" Serious
or "I could be convinced" Serious?
We will survive one more night.
Speak for yourself.
If we wait...
...our wedding night will be so amazing.
And tonight could also be...
so amazing.
Okay.
Okay.
You...
What's that?
Good night, Jackson.
I'm gonna go now.
Good night, Jackson.
You put the chain on?
I'll see you in the morning.
All right.
Forget something?
What time?
What about this one?
I really have my heart set on getting married in white.
The wedding dress you're wearing is gorgeous.
I know a cleaner who can get that stain out.
Yeah, thank you, but I need a new dress.
I'll see what I have in the back.
Thank you. Thank you.
Yes, thank you. Bye.
All right.
We've got ourselves a justice of the peace.
Tomorrow afternoon, he will marry us.
Uh, a justice of the peace?
Okay, so, um...
Our wedding will be...
Legal. Yeah.
He's got a license.
He's not an elvis or a pirate
Or a cartoon character.
I-I -- I had just really hoped that we'd find a minister.
Someone nondenominational, obviously,
But, you know, just someone who's at least been ordained.
April, I'm not religious.
No, I know, I know.
Just having someone
with some sort of relationship with god marry us
is kind of important to me.
I mean, even finding this guy
wasn't easy on such short notice.
I mean, having a wedding without a lot of god talk
is kind of important to me.
I always had such, like, a clear idea
of what my wedding would look like.
Want me to bring you back to the barn, or were you --
No! Stop it, Jackson. No.
I just want god at my wedding.
I want him there for the most important day of my life.
Well, you know that after we get married,
I'm not gonna turn into this churchgoing guy.
You know, I watch football on sundays.
You are not changing who you are,
and I do not want you to.
But you can't expect me to change who I am, either.
How's this one?
Right idea, wrong color.
Okay.
I'll make some phone calls,
and we'll find an ordained minister.
Thank you.
Did you see what we just did there?
We disagreed.
We discussed.
We compromised.
We are pretty amazing at this marriage thing.
We are.
This one?
Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh! Oh!
No, no, no, no, no! Don't look!
It's bad luck! It's bad luck!
Yes, yes, yes!
No, no, wait. You can't steal all my fries.
Sure, I can. What's mine is yours.
What's yours is mine.
We're not married yet.
Oh! Ooh! Aw, crap. Sorry. Crap, crap, crap. Oh, no! Aah!
You know what? No more fries for you.
It was an accident.
No, no. No more.
Hey.
Where are we gonna live?
After?
Well, I was thinking... what about my place?
Absolutely.
Really?
Yeah.
It's way nicer. It's bigger. It's perfect.
Great.
But I'm not changing my name.
What? Avery's a great name.
So is Kepner. You want to take it?
Sure.
Really?
No.
No, I'm not changing my name.
Okay.
I didn't expect you to, either.
That's not really a thing for me.
It's not?
No, definitely not.
What?
Holy crap.
We did this!
We are doing this.
We're doing this.
I love you. I always have.
Even the things I don't like, I love.
You're getting married?
Unless you can give me a reason not to.
Look, we're not doing this anymore, okay?
No more screwing in closets. No more screwing anywhere.
I told you -- last time was the last time.
Hey. What's wrong?
I am supposed to do a facial reanimation surgery.
A procedure Sloan practically invented in my third year.
Done it with him like a handful of times.
I mean, I never --
There's no way I can do this on my own.
Of course you can.
No, you haven't seen him do it.
He's brilliant, okay, and so precise.
I just needed more time.
You can do this,Jackson.
April, what if I can't? What if I make her worse?
This woman's counting on me,
and I promised that I could help.
Then you will. You will.
I know you will.
You are not a person who makes promises he doesn't keep.
Okay, let's push 10 of morphine. Yeah.
What do we got?
Tatiana Flauto, 30s.
Some psycho threw acid on her face.
Police got him, though.
A good samaritan gave her a towel with ice in it
before the paramedics got there.
And it adhered to the burns.
We haven't been able to see underneath.
Right. All right, let's start with a bottle of saline, please.
No.
Thank you.
Hi. Tatiana, is it? My name is dr. Avery.
I'd like to wet this towel with saline
So it'll come off easier, okay?
Will you let me do that?
I'm scared, I'm scared!
Okay.
I know. I know. It's okay. It's all right.
You're safe now, okay? You're safe here.
I just need you to keep still
so that I can get a look at what's going on.
All right?
No, no, no!
I know. It's okay. You're okay.
No, no, no!
You're okay. I'm gonna help you.
Here comes the saline.
No, no, no, no!
Okay. Here we go.
No! No! No!
All right, it's okay.
Okay. Okay.
Okay.
No, no, no! Really good.
Now we got to remove this towel, okay?
We're gonna get started. It's gonna hurt.
So I need you to take a deep breath for me, okay?
Deep breath.
Here we go. All right.
okay.
No! No!
It's okay.
You're doing great.
Okay.
All done. You did great.
You did great.
Uh, we need to get Sloan down here immediately.
Uh, Sloan is on a plane to Idaho right now.
Can you handle this?
Breathe.
What is it? What's wrong?
It's too bad! You can't fix my face!
No, no. No, no, no! No, Tatiana, hey.
I know that we just met, all right?
But what you don't know is that you and I,
we are a team now.
It's gonna be you and me.
We're gonna get through this together, all right?
I'm not gonna lie. It's not gonna be easy,
and it's not gonna be quick,
but I'm gonna be right here the entire time, okay?
I will not leave your side.
I promise you.
Okay?
All right.
Let's get mepitel and xeroform, please. Oh.
Jackson. Hey.
It's okay. Really.
I lost some -- some friends that day.
I hate Sloan.
Even when I'm perfect, he talks to me like I'm an idiot.
Well, try spending a day in the E.R. with Dr. Major Owen Hunt.
That man is dark.
He is a dark, pig-stabbing, scary man.
What?
What's the matter?
This is where Reed was shot...
Where I found her.
I slipped in her blood right there.
I haven't been back here since.
There's an elevator upstairs near where Charles died.
I never use it.
You -- you okay? Hey.
Oh. Okay.
I know. I know.
Okay? We're -- we're here.
We're okay.
I had a gun pointed at me.
I know. I know.
My life flashed before my eyes.
It -- It -- It really did. - Shh. Okay.
And it was so...
Boring!
I just kept thinking, "I don't want to die a virgin."
You can fix that.
Was that a proposition?
No, I meant -- oh, oh!
No! No, no, no, no. I-I didn't mean --
No, I -- no.
I was -- I -- it was a joke. Yeah.
I was making a totally stupid joke.
Yeah, it wasn't good. Yeah.
Okay. I'm...
En--
What? Good luck with Sloan.
Well, that girl is weird.
I'm a virgin. Yes. So what?
It's not something I talk about, okay?
We all have things we don't talk about.
She thinks your husband walks on water.
Cincinnati, Ohio, pediatrics.
Thank you.
Who's next?
Uh, I'll go.
Uh, Charles Percy, Brookings, South Dakota.
I want to be a trauma surgeon.
Or maybe vascular.
Or -- or, like, uh...
I don't know, actually. Uh...
All right, well, you've got a lot of time
to figure that one out.
Who's next?
Uh, right here.
Jackson Avery, originally from Boston --
Oh, h-h-hold on. What?
Like "Harper Avery" Avery?
Uh, yeah, actually.
Anyway
So you're, like, born to the throne.
You know what? I wouldn't --
Do you know a Catherine Avery, the urologist?
I do, actually.
Are you writing this down?
She's just, like, amazing.
Are you going into urology, too?
No. Cardiothoracic all the way.
Can I be done now?
I'll go!
Hi. I'm April Kepner.
I'm from Ohio,
and I'm super-excited to be near the ocean,
although I don't really know how I feel about the rain yet.
As far as specialty goes,
I'm looking for something with set hours
so that I can raise kids eventually --
two boys and a girl.
So I'm thinking plastics, urology, proctology.
we talk about the mechanism of injury...
...about where it all started.
But the truth is...
it's sort of a myth.
We can't boil every injury down to one single blow.
This is one of the simpler divorces I've seen, actually.
You want this?
Do you really want this?
Okay.
What hurts us is cumulative.
It happens over time.
We absorb blow after blow...
...shock after shock, painful hit after hit.
Is there anything else?
Uh, that's it. No.
Okay, then.
But even then...
Even if we know exactly how we got here...
It doesn't mean we can fix it.
Too late to back out?
Are you kidding me? Oh!
Timothy and I had a huge fight this morning.
It was probably my fault.
Well, yeah, with that mouth, probably was.
Look, you guys are gonna fight, okay?
You'll probably have that same fight for 50 years.
But you just can't let it become bigger than the two of you.
So, in other words, marriage is hard...
...but not as hard as getting acid thrown in your face?
Yes.
This mouth. You see? Four years of this.
And yet you still agreed to walk me down the aisle.
You kept every promise you made to me.
Thank you.
I'm sorry about you and April.
No.
Today's about you, okay?
Let's get you married.
For you.
You can't heal every wound.
And that's okay.
I have to believe it's okay.
I wasn't sure what you would be in the mood for,
so I kind of got everything.
Champagne, tequila, pinot noir --
Pick your poison.
No, thanks.
What's happening?
Did you already start drinking? Are you -- are you drunk?
What? I'm...
hungry, maybe.
What?
You just signed divorce papers,
and you don't want a drink?
What are you -- what are you, pregnant?
What?
April.
I have to believe that even if something
seems like it cannot be fixed...
According to the test I took this morning,
yeah, actually.
I think I am.
...it doesn't mean it's broken.
