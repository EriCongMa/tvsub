i don &apos;t want to do it . i mean , i want to do it ,
but not like this .
it &apos;s our first time ,
and we gotta get on the road . we got a midnight show in l.a.
you want a beer ?
i had sex for the first time , with wyatt .
cheers .
brandon .
let &apos;s do tequila shots .
what happened , brandon ?
i overslept .
did you rewrite your fugue ?
no , i didn &apos;t get a chance to finish it .
what were you doing all night ?
my name &apos;s cole . i &apos;m 15 . i &apos;m a transgender . male .
sorry .
get out !
i am a foster kid .
do you really trust him ?
why do you ask ?
you know the reason he &apos;s here , right ?
what &apos;s up with that tony gwynn ball in your room ?
that was actually a gift .
what the hell are you doing ?
what &apos;s going on ?
you want to tell her or should i ?
look , this isn &apos;t what you think it is .
just say it , you were going to steal the ball .
no , man . that &apos;s not--
really ? you &apos;re going to deny it ?
brandon , let him talk .
i was putting it back .
i told you we couldn &apos;t trust him .
i &apos;m not going to let my dad get screwed over .
brandon , hold on . um , a.j. , will you just ...
okay , you need to chill , please ?
you &apos;re going to defend him ?
he took off today , brandon , he &apos;s scared .
oh , okay . so that &apos;s what people do when they &apos;re scared ?
they steal ? really ? what happens when he gets scared again ?
do you remember when i first came here ?
i would &apos;ve done anything to get to jude .
you didn &apos;t steal .
i would have .
i didn &apos;t trust anyone until you showed me that i could .
your dad did that with a.j. today .
can you please just let this go ? if not for a.j. , for me .
brandon &apos;s cool ...
for now .
but if you so much as breathe funny , you &apos;re on your own .
anybody home ?
how &apos;s your mom ?
they &apos;re coming for a visit .
huh ! when ?
tomorrow .
apparently , nate &apos;s in town on business ,
and mom and dad want us all to have dinner together .
really ?
how do you feel about that ?
well , i guess i &apos;m ... fine .
i kinda have to be , right ?
but do you mind if we have them here , though ?
i don &apos;t want to go to some restaurant
where we won &apos;t be able to really talk , you know ?
do you really want to talk ?
with all the kids here ?
no , it &apos;ll be saturday night ,
all the kids will be out ,
and honestly ,
it &apos;s time to clear the air , right ?
i mean , he and my mom worked it out ,
and if she can forgive him for calling her that hateful word ,
i guess i can , too .
so , you drove all the way from san francisco ?
isn &apos;t that like--
nine hours ? yeah .
but it was worth it . look ...
the whole trip all i &apos;ve been thinking about is ...
how we left things .
but i kinda feel like
i left you with the wrong impression .
i love you .
and i really want to have sex with you .
i mean , if you still want to ?
okay , good .
but , i mean , not tonight , right ?
i mean , we can &apos;t , my moms are home .
no , of course .
but , maybe before i go back on the road ?
hey , watch it .
what ?
oh , that &apos;s how it &apos;s gonna be ?
are you serious ?
you started it .
how long are we gonna stay here for ?
um , i kinda promised callie that i &apos;d spend the day with her .
i don &apos;t want to be the kind of girl that , you know ,
drops everything and cancels on everyone
just to spend time with her boyfriend . okay ?
okay ... yeah , sure .
so tell me about the tour . how is it ?
it &apos;s pretty boring , really .
mostly just driving around in the van ,
eating gas station hot dogs ,
and never have i ever .
for the record , jasper &apos;s tried some pretty messed up stuff .
yeah , like you &apos;re not mobbed by groupies after every show .
you got me .
check this one out .
she &apos;s a little nuts , but a total brainiac .
and , dare i say it , super hot .
you photoshopped me into all of your tour pictures ?
see ? i only have eyes for one groupie .
cole !
hey , stranger .
hi !
it &apos;s so good to see you .
wait , your voice .
yeah .
guys , this is cole .
hey !
hey , any musical geniuses here ?
hey , grampa !
hey , brandon , how are you ?
good .
good . how &apos;s that fancy summer music camp coming ?
uh , not so great , at the moment .
really ? why ? what &apos;s the matter ?
ugh ! where do i start ?
let &apos;s just say i have a
mid @-@ term presentation for the dean tonight
and nothing to play .
they &apos;ve got a dean at a camp ?
must be serious , huh ?
you think ?
and it &apos;s not even the dean that &apos;s stressing me out .
it &apos;s my stupid partner .
it &apos;s like , no matter what i do , she dumps all over it .
yeah ? well , you better get to work
and just compose something so undeniably brilliant
that it &apos;ll shut her up for good .
easier said than done .
oh , hey ! sorry that i can &apos;t be here for dinner with nate .
oh , that &apos;s okay . we &apos;ll have a good brunch tomorrow .
grandpa , can i ask you something ?
yeah .
what happened ? with nate , i mean .
mama never talks about him .
how do i put this ? when i remarried dana ,
nate felt abandoned .
he was angry .
he was very , very angry .
for good reason . i should &apos;ve never let his mother have custody ,
but back in those days ...
anyway , i got him out
to come spend the summer with us ,
and he was so ...
surly nasty that ultimately he ended up going home early .
and after that , it was easy for him to just cut us off .
i reached out to him over the years ,
and then finally last year , he reached back .
anyway , i &apos;m talking your ear off , you got work to do .
just tell me one thing , where is the working bathroom ?
i got a bladder that &apos;s about to burst .
just there .
oh , thanks . see you soon .
what is all this ?
dana , it looks like you brought the whole market with you .
don &apos;t be silly .
you &apos;re so lovely to host with such short notice .
we just picked up a few things .
enough for a nice charcuterie plate ... or two .
where &apos;s daddy ?
he needs to get his prostate checked .
i swear the man pees every 15 seconds .
oh , i hope you don &apos;t mind , but nate called .
he &apos;s bringing his girlfriend to dinner .
his girlfriend ?
do you really think that &apos;s appropriate ? i mean ,
if i would &apos;ve known he wasn &apos;t coming alone ,
i might have preferred we do this at a restaurant .
oh , it &apos;ll be fine , honey .
sure , it &apos;ll be fine ,
but how are we supposed to have a real conversation
with his girlfriend here ?
a conversation about what ?
we haven &apos;t seen each other in 20 years , mom .
you don &apos;t think we need to talk about why ?
no , i don &apos;t . it &apos;ll just upset your father .
wait a second .
dad still doesn &apos;t know about this ?
about what nate called you ?
no , he doesn &apos;t .
and i &apos;d like to keep it that way .
when nate reached out to you before christmas ,
what did he say to you ?
he apologized , right ?
no . no , he didn &apos;t .
we didn &apos;t talk about it .
lena , please , can we just ...
can we just , what ? pretend like it never happened ?
he said horrible things to you .
how can you even consider having a relationship with him
without talking about it ?
because i just want to keep the past where it belongs ,
and have a lovely family reunion .
i see no reason to punish a grown man for ,
what , he said 20 years ago .
i got over it . it &apos;s time you got over it , lena .
where &apos;s my baby ?
hi , daddy ...
hey !
hey , stef .
stewart , so good to see you .
you , too .
oh , i got something for my girl .
oh , daddy .
i haven &apos;t had any of this in ages .
i can never find it around here .
i ordered it special .
thank you . always thinkin &apos; of me .
no , thank you .
thank you for agreeing to this dinner .
i &apos;m very grateful to have us all together finally .
and a lot of queer kids don &apos;t even go to prom .
i mean , when your school can stop a boy from wearing a dress ,
or two girls from going as dates ,
what &apos;s the point ?
so , i figured we should put together a night that &apos;s just ours .
a night where we can just ...
be , you know .
sounds cool .
you should come , it &apos;ll give you and jude a chance
to meet other gay kids your age .
who are you taking ?
i am goin &apos; stag .
no ! you cannot go to your own prom alone .
there has to be someone you can ask .
like who ?
like me .
seriously ? you don &apos;t have plans ?
i was just gonna go to the movies with jude and connor ,
but no , we &apos;ll all come .
we will ?
yeah . it &apos;ll be fun .
for real ? are you sure ?
yeah , if you &apos;ll have me .
all right , sweet . it &apos;s a date .
i &apos;m gonna go hit the water , cool off .
rematch .
so , what happened to him ?
he &apos;s transgender .
was born in the wrong body .
so those scars ...
he did that on purpose ?
yeah , and ...
okay , when i first met cole ,
he was literally binding his chest .
and look how proud he is now .
taking off his shirt like that .
he &apos;s in a good place finally ,
so don &apos;t go making him feel weird about it .
damn . i was just asking .
remind me not to mess with you .
i &apos;m going in .
those sharks better watch out .
i know what you &apos;re gonna say ,
&quot; hate the word and not the hater . &quot;
i just don &apos;t believe that someone could say something so racist
and not be one , especially that word .
i hear you , love .
i get that nate was 17 , and he was angry .
he didn &apos;t get to live with his dad .
i &apos;m even willing to believe that he doesn &apos;t feel that way now ,
and he would never say anything so ignorant and hateful right now ,
but he said it then .
and i just can &apos;t understand how he could try
to reconcile with my mom without apologizing .
your mom doesn &apos;t seem to need an apology .
or she &apos;s just too uncomfortable to ask for one !
i &apos;m not just gonna smile and pretend it never happened .
and no one is asking you to .
my mother is !
you don &apos;t need to do what she says , lena .
you don &apos;t need her permission .
you pull nate aside and you have a conversation with him .
the conversation you want to have .
you want an apology , you get one .
you don &apos;t seem very happy he &apos;s here .
i know you said it &apos;s no big deal ,
but just because you had sex with mat once
doesn &apos;t mean you have to do it again .
if you &apos;re not ready , he &apos;ll understand .
i wish i could take it back .
yeah , but you love him , right ?
okay , so even if the timing wasn &apos;t right ,
at least the guy was .
you &apos;re really lucky
you lost your virginity to someone that you love .
oh , my god . is that ...
wyatt . yeah .
he &apos;s life @-@ guarding this summer . you wanna come say hi ?
okay .
wanna get in the water ?
um , actually , we should get out of here .
i thought you wanted to spend the day with callie .
honestly , she &apos;s kinda getting on my nerves .
it &apos;s fine . let &apos;s just go . are you hungry ?
yeah .
hey , buddy .
save it . i &apos;m not your buddy .
whoa . why so aggro ?
is this how you &apos;re gonna play this , really ? dumb ?
play what ?
you and kat , setting me up .
what are you talking about ?
you get me to that party
so she can make me think she &apos;s sleeping in ,
and when i don &apos;t show up to work in the morning ,
i look like a flake in front of chris .
all so that he &apos;ll let the two of you work together .
dude , that &apos;s insane .
is it ?
maybe . either way , i &apos;m still here .
okay ? it didn &apos;t work . i &apos;m still stuck with kat .
and you know what , i might have to deal with her ,
but i don &apos;t have to deal with you .
oh ! i gotta get over to the hall and help him set up .
oh , okay . um ...
so i &apos;ll see you there . what time should we ...
no , i &apos;m gonna pick you up .
what kinda gentleman do you think i am ?
okay . what time ?
6 : 00 ?
that works . i &apos;ll see you then .
yes , you will .
what ?
you like him .
yeah , as a friend .
well , he likes you , and not as a friend .
trust . tonight ? that &apos;s a date .
a date @-@ date .
you &apos;re ridiculous .
i saw him checking you out .
what that dude was thinking was definitely not friendly .
how &apos;s that book ?
come in .
is that what you &apos;re wearing ?
i know cole said it was creative black tie , but ...
no . i didn &apos;t wanna tell my dad where i was going , so ...
i brought some stuff .
you look great .
thanks .
it &apos;s jesus &apos; .
a.j. picked it out .
i was going to get you a corsage ,
but i figured this would last longer .
it &apos;s a joke .
yeah . i got it .
i got it !
oh , my goodness .
don &apos;t you look so dapper . please , come in .
thank you .
callie , cole &apos;s here ! lena , get your phone !
dana , stewart . this is cole , callie &apos;s friend .
hi .
how do you do ?
i &apos;m good .
how are you , cole ?
so handsome .
what &apos;s up , cole ?
you lookin &apos; tight .
hey ! thank you .
lovin &apos; the suit .
oh , my god !
look at our beautiful girl , stewart .
freeze ! freeze right there . lena , you getting this ?
you look so beautiful , callie .
hey ! none of this half @-@ smile crap . come on , smile .
oh , callie , look how beautiful
you look when you smile ...
look at that .
hey ! jude , connor ! let &apos;s go boys . let &apos;s go !
look at how nice y &apos;all two match .
nice dress .
oh , this ? no ! i picked it up from
the vintage store on my way home from the beach .
it &apos;s nothing .
well , you look amazing .
thank you .
okay , you guys , get together . come on .
that &apos;s a nice corsage .
callie ! smile ! please smile .
can this be over now ?
stop !
and look at our beautiful boys !
jude , why so serious , my friend ? let me see some teeth .
wait , wait . look like
you &apos;re looking at connor for the first time .
you &apos;re seeing him , &quot; oh , look how he &apos;s so handsome . &quot;
mom , seriously ?
yes , i &apos;m totally serious .
okay , you guys , group shot . get together .
hurry up . hurry up . you &apos;re going to be late .
here we go . all right . and no blinking , my babies .
you ready ? one , two , three ...
here we go . smile , callie .
honey , this is missing something .
cayenne .
lena , dear , do you have any cayenne ?
look , i know nate &apos;s bringing his girlfriend ,
but i &apos;m gonna pull him aside and talk to him .
you may not need to and that &apos;s fine , but i do .
hi , lena .
hi , dad , dana .
this is faith .
i &apos;ll never understand how you don &apos;t like mocha .
i don &apos;t like coffee with my ice cream !
leave me alone .
i like my chocolate just fine , thank you .
so , um ...
there &apos;s nobody home at my place .
do you wanna head over there ?
so what ?
we &apos;ll just have sex and then you &apos;ll leave me in the morning ?
oh , i thought ...
i thought that &apos;s what you wanted .
that was before , but ...
you were right , i think we should wait .
and you &apos;ll be home in a couple of weeks , so ...
oh , actually ...
what ?
we &apos;re extending ... the tour .
for how long ?
so how long have you two been together ?
oh , what ? six months now ?
has it only been six months ?
oh ! gee , thanks .
no ! no , i mean ...
it feels like we &apos;ve just
always been in each other &apos;s lives .
it was meant to be .
that was well played , nate .
i wouldn &apos;t mind some more grandchildren .
stewart ...
well , the thought has certainly crossed my mind .
do i dare open another bottle ?
sure , i don &apos;t see why not . we &apos;re just getting started .
i &apos;m gonna go check on the roast , honey .
okay .
did you ...
did you know that nate was dating a black girl ?
no , he never mentioned it .
don &apos;t you think it &apos;s a little odd ?
uh , no . you didn &apos;t mention
that stef was white when you started dating her .
what ?
how am i supposed to have a conversation with nate now ?
what do you mean ?
don &apos;t you think it would be just a little bit offensive
with his black girlfriend sitting in the next room ?
no . it shouldn &apos;t , should it ?
i think it was a brilliant way to shut me down .
really , lena ?
you think he &apos;s dating an african @-@ american woman
just to prove to you that he &apos;s not racist ?
or to himself .
or ...
maybe she &apos;s not really his girlfriend .
maybe he hired an actress to play his girlfriend , huh ?
never know .
hey , guys . how &apos;s it going ?
um , this is my date , callie .
so , this is the infamous callie .
the one you are talking about her all the time .
hey , welcome .
i &apos;m jonah . i &apos;m gay .
how &apos;s it going ? lennon , gender @-@ queer .
my preferred pronouns are &quot; they &quot; and &quot; them . &quot;
i &apos;m connor . gay .
i &apos;m jude .
hey , jude .
so ... what are you ?
just jude .
and you guys are a couple ?
yeah .
let me guess , this is your first gay dance ?
so what do we think of brandon &apos;s fugue ?
i think it &apos;s great .
i think it shows a lotta growth .
personally , i think it &apos;s less imaginative than his first pass .
really ? you think it &apos;s unimaginative ?
i &apos;ll be sure to tell johann sebastian bach you said so .
wait , this is bach ?
yes . it &apos;s obscure .
it &apos;s almost completely unknown , in fact ,
but it &apos;s bach .
having fun ?
sure , i mean . we just got here , but yeah .
so what &apos;s the deal with your boyfriend ?
he &apos;s not gay , he &apos;s &quot; just jude &quot; ?
he doesn &apos;t really like labels ...
ah ! i see .
translation , he &apos;s not sure he &apos;s gay .
been there , done that , girl .
been where ? done what ?
been with boys who are curious or whatever .
listen , i &apos;m only telling you this ,
because i wish someone had warned me when i was your age ,
but if a guy can &apos;t say he &apos;s gay ,
it &apos;s because he ain &apos;t sure he is .
and queen , that just means he &apos;s gonna end up dumping you
and breaking your baby @-@ gay heart .
need anything ?
no . the roast just needs to rest for a little bit .
faith is lovely .
isn &apos;t she ?
you know what ...
i should &apos;ve said this earlier ,
thank you for reaching out at christmas .
it meant a lot .
don &apos;t mention it .
hey , there you are .
what &apos;re you doing ?
dancing .
it &apos;s a gay dance , right ?
this is stupid . can we just go ?
if you want to leave , then just go .
whatever ...
but i &apos;m gonna stay .
i &apos;m having a good time .
but you know , i &apos;m gay , so ...
seriously , you signed your name to a bach fugue ?
i only recognized it because i wrote my thesis on bach .
i know that , teri . that &apos;s why i picked it .
i read your bio . i knew you &apos;d recognize it .
what a joke .
and i knew you would say it was crap .
oh , please .
you plagiarized and got caught ,
and now you &apos;re just trying to cover your ass .
i did the work . here &apos;s my original piece .
you actually wrote that one , right ?
yes .
well , you &apos;ve certainly managed to prove that you can &apos;t work together .
but quite frankly ,
i &apos;ve had enough of you two making a joke of this program .
what does that mean ?
i don &apos;t know . i need to talk with chris .
we &apos;ll see you at seminar tonight and let you know what we decide .
i mean , she &apos;s always been so sweet .
um , once we were at the pier ,
and lena accidentally let go of her balloon ,
and she just sobbed .
yeah , i remember that !
i was gonna get her another one ,
but that wasn &apos;t why she was crying .
she said that she was afraid that it would land in the ocean
and choke a dolphin to death .
our lena has always been very sensitive .
actually , i didn &apos;t lose it ... the balloon .
nate took it from me , and let it go to make me cry .
really ?
it &apos;s true .
typical older brother stuff .
i &apos;m sorry i was such an ass .
just add that to my long list of regrets .
and , lena , i know i owe you and dana and dad , i guess ,
an apology .
i ... i feel terrible for stealing
them away from you guys last christmas .
and i know it was hard being away from the grandkids ,
so anyway , i &apos;m sorry
and i &apos;ll try to be more considerate in the future .
well , nate , that was just one christmas .
we &apos;re really sorry about all the many christmases
that we didn &apos;t spend with you .
don &apos;t do that , mom .
don &apos;t you dare apologize to him .
lena ?
lena , please .
do you really think christmas
christmas is the only thing you have to apologize for ?
what &apos;s going on ?
he said he was sorry for teasing you as a kid .
siblings fight .
seriously , mom ?
lena , please don &apos;t do this in front of our guest .
lena ?
excuse me .
um ... sorry , i didn &apos;t ...
no , no , i get it . it &apos;s fine .
what are you doing out here ?
i think i &apos;m gonna call my moms to come get me .
what happened ?
connor freaked out because i won &apos;t say i &apos;m gay .
but i don &apos;t get it , why do i have to call myself anything ?
look , i ...
i understand not wanting to have to check a box or whatever ,
but there &apos;s power in labels , too , you know ...
when i was at girls united ,
most of the girls refused to call me &quot; he . &quot;
and my label is what got me through .
my label got me into an lgbt home
where i can just be ...
you know ... me .
no questions asked .
i &apos;m not saying labels are for everyone ...
but sometimes they can ...
i don &apos;t know ...
make us feel not so alone .
you &apos;re lucky .
you live in a home where you can just be ...
whoever you want to be .
i guess not everyone has it so good , huh ?
am i wrong about this ?
am i just holding on to something i need to let go of ?
mom , i don &apos;t want another lecture from you . i get it .
you don &apos;t understand where i &apos;m coming from . you never do .
and if i &apos;m feeling something that you don &apos;t understand ,
then you make me feel like i &apos;m wrong for even feeling it .
that is not true .
it is true , dana .
when it comes to lena , i &apos;m sorry ,
but you can be very dismissive .
i &apos;m sorry , stef , but this is none of your business .
i beg to differ .
you want to be protective of stewart ?
well , i want to protect lena .
i understand that
you don &apos;t want him to be hurt by what nate said ,
but lena was and still is .
how can you not see that ?
okay , fine . so maybe you &apos;re right .
maybe i don &apos;t understand why you &apos;re so hurt .
what nate said to me was horrible ,
but he said it to me .
why does it have to matter so much to you ?
because , mom , when someone calls one person the n @-@ word ,
it doesn &apos;t just hurt that black person .
it hurts all of us . that word cuts .
whether you &apos;re black , or your mixed ...
especially when it &apos;s directed at someone you love ,
at your mother , your hero .
it would have hurt less if he &apos;d said it to me .
and what if he did ? what if he said it to me ?
would you be so quick to forgive and forget ?
since kat and brandon don &apos;t seem to be able to work together ,
they &apos;ll need to find someone
willing to double up in order to work with them .
that means twice the work for a composer
willing to team up with kat ,
and twice the work for a pianist
willing to take on brandon .
let &apos;s start with kat .
is there a composer that would like to work with her ?
no one ?
i &apos;m sorry , kat , you &apos;re out .
seriously ? nobody ?
tony ?
i am the most talented pianist here .
pack your things and go home , kat .
you are making a big mistake .
so what about brandon ?
is there a pianist
willing to double up and work with him ?
is everything okay ?
nate , lena and i ...
we need an apology .
an apology for what ?
for calling me that hateful word .
wait , what word ?
you know what word .
when did this happen ?
the summer he came to visit
and he left early .
nate got angry with me ,
and called me a--
no . no .
is this true ?
no , i mean ...
not that i recall .
did you call my wife that word ?
i would never say that .
maybe you misheard ?
no .
nate .
you &apos;re not going to apologize ?
you &apos;re gonna take her word over mine ?
i &apos;m sorry , faith , that you had to be a party to this ,
but i &apos;m going to have to ask you both to leave .
of course , you choose them .
you always did .
let &apos;s go .
how come you never told me about this
in all these years ?
because i was afraid that you would never forgive him .
you were right .
why did you want to be my date ?
because--
because you felt sorry for me ?
i don &apos;t need a pity date .
i saw the way you looked at me
when i took my shirt off at the beach .
just say it , you won &apos;t date me
because you don &apos;t see me as a guy .
that is so unfair .
i &apos;ve always treated you like a guy , cole , always .
i won &apos;t date you because i see you as a friend !
what am i supposed to date every single guy i know ?
i &apos;ve had two boyfriends in my life , cole . two !
and you know what i really don &apos;t need right now ?
is another boyfriend .
i need a friend .
okay , i &apos;m sorry if that &apos;s not good enough for you .
and i &apos;ve never pitied you .
okay ? i look up to you .
i mean , look at this , look at what you did .
you made this party happen .
you &apos;re not just making life better for yourself ,
