turn it off .
she &apos;s ruthless without her humanity .
so , what are we gonna do ?
lock her up
make her life a living hell .
i was in new orleans trying to find information about my real parents .
i &apos;ve only seen that mark on a handful of others ,
all from the same werewolf clan
that once thrived throughout louisiana .
what makes you think i &apos;ll spare your beloved katerina ?
you will spare her because i &apos;m asking you to spare her .
as your only living brother ,
i would ask that you provide me with this opportunity to love .
klaus , you have refused me my freedom .
in return , i have one last thing to offer you .
there is a witch in new orleans
named jane @-@ anne deveraux plotting a move against you .
hunt her down .
that &apos;s the calmest desiccating vampire i &apos;ve ever seen .
i remember when you starved me down there for 3 days .
i would &apos;ve wept at your feet for an orange peel .
look , she &apos;s not gonna beg for blood .
begging means desperation .
emotion . she &apos;s still in no @-@ humanity zone .
how hungry does she have to be
before we can torture some feelings back into her ?
a lot hungrier than she is now , apparently .
so , what are we supposed to do in the meantime ?
maybe i can provide a little excitement .
katherine .
the one and only . sort of .
so , when &apos;s the welcome home party ?
wow . look who went and got bold .
last time i checked , klaus was plotting your eternal demise .
well , it doesn &apos;t matter anymore ,
because klaus is gone .
wait . what do you mean he &apos;s gone ?
let &apos;s just say that werewolf girl hayley
turned out to be just the thing we needed
to get klaus out of our lives for good .
third time in here this week .
i &apos;m obsessed with the gumbo , jane @-@ anne .
the old ladies in the ninth ward say my sister sophie
bleeds a piece of her soul into every dish .
i asked around the quarter about my family .
and ?
nothing . zero .
i can &apos;t find a single person who remembers them .
because , hayley , people like you were run out of here years ago .
what do you mean , people like me ?
in the bayou , they call the werewolves roux @-@ ga @-@ roux .
you head out there ,
you &apos;ll find what you &apos;re looking for .
be careful .
it &apos;s the last place you &apos;d ever want to go .
don &apos;t do it . please .
what if i &apos;m wrong about her ?
that &apos;s the beauty of you . you &apos;re never wrong .
she &apos;s the only way we &apos;re gonna get to klaus .
can we get someone else to do the spell ?
who ? half the witches don &apos;t believe you .
the other half are too scared .
because they know we &apos;re gonna get caught , jane @-@ anne .
we don &apos;t have any other option , sophie .
now go . you know what you need to do .
what the--uhh !
are you kidding me ?
hey , i &apos;m looking for a tow service .
welcome to the dark side of new orleans ,
a supernatural playground
where the living are easily lost
and the dead stick around and play .
new orleans ?
what the hell is klaus doing there ?
evidently , there are witches conspiring against him .
so , knowing our brother ,
this was a mission to silence and slaughter .
well , the french quarter witches are not a lot to be trifled with .
you don &apos;t suppose they &apos;ve found a way
to kill him once and for all , do you ?
rebekah , in the name of our family ,
you might try to dial down your glee .
what family ?
we are 3 distrustful acquaintances
who happen to share a bloodline .
i for one hope they &apos;ve found a way to make that traitorous bastard rot .
good afternoon . time for one more ?
i have nothing to say to you .
oh , now , that &apos;s not very amiable , is it ?
you don &apos;t even know me .
i know what you are .
half @-@ vampire , half @-@ beast .
you &apos;re the hybrid .
i &apos;m the original hybrid , actually ,
but that &apos;s a long story for another time .
where are you going ?
to find out who &apos;s making a move against our father , and then ...
i &apos;ll either stop them ,
or i &apos;ll help them .
depending on my mood .
i &apos;m looking for someone . a witch .
perhaps you might be able to help me find her .
jane @-@ anne deveraux .
sorry . i don &apos;t know .
well , now , that &apos;s a fib , isn &apos;t it ?
now , you see ... i know that you &apos;re a true witch
amongst this sea of poseurs .
so , enough with the fabrications .
i &apos;ve quite a temper .
witches don &apos;t talk outta school in the quarter .
the vampire won &apos;t allow it .
those are the rules .
i don &apos;t break marcel &apos;s rules .
marcel &apos;s rules ?
where do you suppose i might find marcel ?
thank you .
klaus .
marcel .
must be 100 years since that nasty business with your papa .
has it been that long ?
way i recall it , he ran you out of town .
left a trail of dead vampires in his wake .
and yet how fortunate you managed to survive .
my father , i &apos;m afraid , i recently incinerated to dust .
well , if i &apos;d known you were coming back in town ,
if i had a heads @-@ up--
what , marcel ?
what would you have done ?
i &apos;d have thrown you a damn parade .
niklaus mikaelson .
my mentor , my savior , my sire .
let &apos;s get you a drink .
it is good to see you .
it &apos;s good to be home .
although please tell me
the current state of bourbon street is not your doing .
something &apos;s gotta draw in the out @-@ of @-@ towners ,
otherwise , we &apos;d all go hungry .
i see your friends are daywalkers .
yeah , yeah , i shared the secret of your daylight ring
with a few buddies .
just the inner circle , though .
the family .
tell me .
how did you find a witch willing to make daylight rings ?
i got the witches here wrapped around my finger .
is that so ?
i &apos;m looking for a witch
by the name of jane @-@ anne deveraux .
has some business with me .
looking for jane @-@ anne ?
then you probably oughta come with me .
showtime !
how &apos;s the family ?
those who live hate me more than ever .
forget them .
if your blood relations let you down , you make your own , huh ?
you taught me that .
and what &apos;s mine is yours , as always .
even my nightwalkers , the riff @-@ raff .
they &apos;re hardly subtle , are they ?
it &apos;s the quarter .
ain &apos;t no such thing as subtle , baby .
jane @-@ anne deveraux .
give it up for jane @-@ anne . come on .
jane @-@ anne deveraux ,
you have been accused of the practice of witchcraft
beyond the bounds of the rules set forth and enforced by me .
how do you plead ?
was that convincing ? i studied law back in the fifties .
hold that thought .
seriously , j , tick tock .
you know the drill . how do you plead ?
i didn &apos;t do anything .
that &apos;s a lie . you know it , i know it ,
and you hate that i know it .
it drives you witches crazy that i &apos;m aware of your every move .
that you can &apos;t do magic in this town without getting caught .
so , why don &apos;t we just cut to the chase , huh ?
you tell me what magic you &apos;re brewing .
tell me . i &apos;ll grant you leniency .
hey , i am , after all , a merciful man .
rot in hell , monster .
i &apos;ll tell you what .
i &apos;ll give you one more chance .
or not .
yeah !
what was that ?
hey . come walk with me .
witches aren &apos;t allowed to do magic here .
she broke the rules .
i told you i wanted to talk to her .
hey , i &apos;m sorry . i got caught up in the show .
those witches , they think that they still have power in this town .
i have to show them that they don &apos;t .
i never waste an opportunity for a show of force .
another lesson that i learned from you .
and besides , anything that you could &apos;ve gotten out of her ,
i can find out for you , and i will .
i promise .
well , whatever it was ,
doesn &apos;t matter anymore , does it ?
good . then let &apos;s eat ,
because all that spilled blood makes me hungry .
hey . thierry , isn &apos;t it ?
any more deveraux witches where she came from ?
you &apos;re klaus .
i am .
and you &apos;re upset .
sophie , isn &apos;t it ?
i assume this is because of what i just witnessed with your sister
on the corner of royal and st. ann .
did you enjoy the show ?
it was a little melodramatic for my tastes .
what did your sister want with me ?
why did marcel kill her ?
i see you brought friends .
they &apos;re not with me .
they &apos;re with marcel .
that &apos;s all that matters .
i know you built this town ,
but this is his town now .
he killed my sister because she broke the rules .
so , i talk to you in front of them , i &apos;m next .
are you two gentlemen following me ?
marcel said we &apos;re your guides .
oh , he did , did he ? he did .
well , then , let me be exceedingly clear about something .
if either of you follow me again ,
you &apos;ll do so without the benefit of a spine .
sorry for the wait . if you &apos;re here for the gumbo ,
i &apos;m about to break your heart .
we just ran out .
your oldest scotch for my two friends here , love .
marcel wants to know what i &apos;m up to ,
he can ask me himself .
the doors work , you know .
you doing magic ?
i &apos;m praying to my dead sister .
go ahead . pay your respects .
don &apos;t make this a thing , sophie .
the hybrid was looking for jane @-@ anne .
marcel wants to know why .
oh , that sounds like witch business .
i &apos;d say ask her yourself ,
but i guess you can &apos;t seeing as how marcel killed her .
i &apos;m elijah .
you &apos;ve heard of me ?
yes .
so why don &apos;t you tell me what business your family has with my brother ?
where &apos;s marcel ?
who the hell &apos;s asking ?
i assume you &apos;re joking .
i only answer to marcel .
well , then , in that case , perhaps you &apos;ll answer to this .
you &apos;re aware the bite of a werewolf can kill a vampire ?
well , as you can see , i &apos;m half @-@ werewolf ,
so i &apos;m gonna ask you one more time !
where is marcel ?
i &apos;m right here . i &apos;m right here . easy , now .
diego &apos;s just looking out for me .
nobody harms my guys . those are the rules .
i don &apos;t care about your rules , marcel .
i don &apos;t need chaperones .
why are you having me followed ?
come here .
i get it , huh ? show of force . you made your point .
let it go , friend . for me .
fine .
why don &apos;t you show me what you &apos;ve done with the place
while you explain exactly what it is you &apos;ve been up to in my town .
follow me .
look at that skyline .
that there , that &apos;s progress .
more hotels , more tourists , more fresh blood .
and the humans ?
i taught them to look the other way .
and what of the witches ?
in my time , they were a force to be reckoned with ,
and now they live in fear .
how do you know when they &apos;re using magic ?
maybe i got a secret weapon , an ace up my sleeve ,
something that gives me complete control
over all the magic in this town .
is that a fact ?
might be .
or maybe i &apos;m just bluffing .
you take vervain ?
burns like a bitch .
but i figure i should limit the number of things
i &apos;m vulnerable to .
don &apos;t be mad about that chaperone thing .
i told my guys to look out for you , that &apos;s all .
that &apos;s what we do here-- look out for each other .
new blood .
the bartender , walking alone at night .
she &apos;s either brave or dumb .
let &apos;s see . brave , i let her live ,
dumb , she &apos;s dessert .
you know , it &apos;s not safe here alone .
you know , i have a black belt in karate .
evening , elijah .
niklaus .
what an entirely unwelcome surprise .
and what an entirely unsurprising welcome .
come with me .
i &apos;m not going anywhere .
not until i find out who &apos;s conspiring against me .
i believe i just found that out for you .
what are we doing here ?
want to know what the witches have in store for you ?
follow me .
sophie deveraux . what is this ?
he &apos;s all yours . proceed .
you know you &apos;re famous in this town ?
witches tell bedtime stories about the powerful vampire klaus .
we know marcel was nothing but an orphaned street rat
until you made him what he is .
and now he &apos;s out of control .
he does what he wants . he kills who he wants .
i &apos;m gonna stop him ...
and you &apos;re gonna help me .
this is why you brought me here .
hear her out .
i don &apos;t need to hear her out .
i assure you , love , there is not a thing on this earth
that will matter enough for me to waste
even 30 more seconds of my time .
elijah , what madness is this ?
klaus ...
you need to listen to them .
you &apos;re all out of your minds
if you think some liquor @-@ fueled one @-@ night stand--
no offense , sweetheart-- means a thing to me .
marcel may be able to keep us from practicing real magic in this town ,
but as keepers of the balance ,
we still know when nature has cooked up something new .
for example , i have a special gift ,
of sensing when a girl is pregnant .
what ?
i know . it &apos;s impossible .
what are you saying ?
niklaus ...
the girl is carrying your child .
no . it &apos;s impossible .
vampires cannot procreate .
but werewolves can .
magic made you a vampire , but you were born a werewolf .
you &apos;re the original hybrid ,
the first of your kind ,
and this pregnancy is one of nature &apos;s loopholes .
you &apos;ve been with someone else . admit it !
i spent days held captive in a freakin &apos; alligator bayou
because they think that i &apos;m carrying some magical miracle baby .
don &apos;t you think i would &apos;ve fessed up if it wasn &apos;t yours ?
my sister gave her life
to perform the spell she needed to confirm this pregnancy .
because of jane @-@ anne &apos;s sacrifice ,
the lives of this girl and her baby are now controlled by us .
if you don &apos;t help us take down marcel ,
so help me , hayley won &apos;t live long enough
to see her first maternity dress .
wait , what ?
enough of this , if you want marcel dead , he &apos;s dead .
i &apos;ll do it myself .
no . we can &apos;t . not yet .
we have a clear plan that we need to follow
and there are rules .
how dare you command me ?
threaten me with what you wrongfully perceive to be my weaknesses ?
i won &apos;t hear any more lies .
niklaus .
listen .
kill her and the baby .
what do i care ?
niklaus
it &apos;s a trick , elijah .
no , brother .
it &apos;s a gift . it &apos;s your chance . it &apos;s our chance .
to what ?
to start over .
take back everything we lost .
everything that was taken from us .
niklaus , our own parents came to despise us .
our family was ruined , we were ruined ,
and since then , all that you have ever wanted ,
all that we have ever wanted ,
was a family .
i will not be manipulated .
so , they &apos;re manipuniting you . so what ?
with them , this girl and her child , your child ...
live .
i &apos;m gonna kill every last one of them .
and then what ? then you return to mystic falls
to resume your life
as the hated one , as the evil hybrid ?
is it so important to you that people
quake with fear at the sound of your name ?
people quake with fear because i have the power to make them afraid .
what will this child offer me ?
will it guarantee me power ?
family is power , niklaus .
love , loyalty . it &apos;s power .
this is what we swore to one another a thousand years ago ,
before life tore away what little humanity you had left ,
before ego , before anger , before paranoia
created in this person before me ...
someone i can barely even recognize as my own brother .
this is us . the original family .
we remain together , always and forever .
i am asking you to stay here .
i will help you and i will stand by you .
i will be your brother .
we will build a home here together .
so , save this girl .
save your child .
no .
he &apos;s doing what he does .
given a chance at happiness ,
klaus runs in the opposite direction .
then let him run .
that child , if it &apos;s even his , is better off without him .
he &apos;s not better off without that child , rebekah ,
and neither are we .
darling , kind elijah .
our brother rarely brings us anything but pain .
at what point in your immortal life
will you stop searching for his redemption ?
i &apos;ll stop searching for his redemption
when i believe there is none left to be found .
i &apos;d give you a play @-@ by @-@ play ,
but you have the air of someone who &apos;s been lurking and listening .
he &apos;ll come around . you know elijah .
he won &apos;t stop until
he &apos;s convinced klaus to do the right thing .
i know you consider yourself an expert in brotherly dynamics ,
but you don &apos;t know my brothers half
as well as you think you do .
you &apos;re wrong .
klaus won &apos;t be able to walk away from this .
he and i are the same .
we manipulate , we thirst for power ,
we control , we punish ,
but our actions are
driven by one singular place deep inside .
and what &apos;s that ?
we &apos;re alone . and we hate it .
tell elijah to call me when he comes home .
i &apos;ll be waiting for him .
hey , man . where &apos;d you run off to ?
you mean your minions aren &apos;t still
documenting my every move ?
someone put you in a mood . what can i do ?
what you can do is you can tell me
what this thing is you have with the witches .
we &apos;re back to that ?
yeah , we &apos;re back to that .
you know i owe you everything i got ,
but i &apos;m afraid i have to draw the line on this one .
this is my business .
i control the witches in my town .
let &apos;s just leave it at that .
your town ?
damn straight .
that &apos;s funny . because when i left 100 years ago ,
you were just a pathetic little scrapper
still trembling from the lashes of the whips of those
who would keep you down ,
and now look at you .
master of your domain .
prince of the city .
i &apos;d like to know how .
why ?
jealous ?
hey , man , i get it .
300 years ago , you helped build
a backwater penal colony into something .
you started it , but then you left .
actually , you ran from it .
i saw it through . look around .
vampires rule this city now .
we don &apos;t have to live in the shadows like rats .
the locals know their place .
they look the other way .
i got rid of the werewolves .
i even found a way to shut down the witches .
the blood never stops flowing
and the party never ends .
you want to pass on through ?
you want to stay a while ? great .
what &apos;s mine is yours , but it is mine .
my home , my family , my rules .
and if someone breaks those rules ?
they die .
mercy is for the weak .
you taught me that , too .
and i &apos;m not the prince of the quarter , friend .
i &apos;m the king !
show me some respect .
your friend will be dead by the weekend .
which means i &apos;ve broken one of your rules .
and yet i cannot be killed .
i am immortal .
who has the power now , friend ?
the hundred dollar guy .
the brave bartender .
camille . that &apos;s a french name .
it &apos;s a grandma &apos;s name . call me cami .
amazing , isn &apos;t he ?
do you paint ?
no , but i admire .
every artist has a story , you know .
and what do you suppose his story is ?
he &apos;s ... angry . dark .
doesn &apos;t feel safe and doesn &apos;t know
what to do about it .
he wishes he could control his demons
instead of having his demons control him .
he &apos;s lost .
alone .
or ... maybe he just drank too much tonight .
sorry . overzealous psych major .
no .
i think you were probably right the first time .
so do you ...
are you here to give me another pep talk
on the joys of fatherhood ?
i &apos;ve said all i needed to say .
i forgot how much i liked this town .
i didn &apos;t forget .
all the centuries we &apos;ve spent together ,
and yet i can count on one hand
the number of times that our family has been truly happy .
i hated leaving here .
as did i.
what is on your mind , brother ?
for a thousand years , i lived in fear .
any time i settled anywhere ,
our father would hunt me down and ... chase me off .
he made me feel powerless ,
and i hated it .
this town was my home once ,
and in my absence , marcel has gotten
everything that i ever wanted .
power , loyalty , family .
i made him in my image
and he has bettered me .
i want what he has .
i want to be king .
and what of hayley and the baby ?
every king needs an heir .
so , how do you propose this will work ?
your brother needs to cement his place
in marcel &apos;s world .
his inner circle , the daywalkers--
that &apos;s where we begin .
they &apos;re his friends . his family .
we &apos;ll be hitting him where it hurts .
i had time to sleep on it last night .
i &apos;m not your enemy .
when my family and i failed this town ...
marcel succeeded .
my blood will heal him .
as though it never happened .
the quarter is your home ,
but i would like to stay a while ,
if i &apos;m still welcome .
caroline . i &apos;m standing in one of
my favorite places in the world ,
surrounded by food , music , art , culture ,
and all i can think about
is how much i want to show it to you .
maybe one day you &apos;ll let me .
so , that &apos;s it ?
i &apos;m just supposed to pack up my things
and leave for good ?
forget my life here and my pursuit of the cure ?
the cure was a fool &apos;s errand .
i mean , taking it would &apos;ve stripped you of everything you are
for what ? more high school proms ?
i wanted to be human .
i wanted children and a family .
and i stand before you to offer you both .
and if i decide against you ?
a dagger in my heart and then back in a box ?
i &apos;ve made my case .
your family needs you .
and what choice you make right now is your own .
i owe him nothing .
i wish him no joy . no love .
i will stay here and live my life
the way i want to , and if you &apos;re smart ,
i suggest you do the same .
she &apos;s right .
be smart , elijah .
klaus is stark raving mad ,
not to mention completely irredeemable .
leave him to set off on this new adventure
and let &apos;s you and i go out on ours .
i have lost so much of my life to klaus .
so have you .
it &apos;s our turn . elijah , please .
katerina ...
you look terrible .
i &apos;m hungry . not that you care .
but i do . that &apos;s the whole point .
i do care . you don &apos;t care .
it &apos;s about time for that to change .
vervain .
how does that make you feel ?
hurt because i &apos;d betray you ?
angry because i &apos;d cause you pain ?
or scared ? because you know
it &apos;s gonna get a lot worse ?
you boys want to play games ?
go ahead .
let &apos;s see who breaks first .
me ... or you .
