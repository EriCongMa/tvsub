look what someone left in our mailbox -- again .
wait , that &apos;s like our fifth one , isn &apos;t it ?
it &apos;s getting kind of creepy .
oh , relax -- it &apos;s probably just from victor ,
that flower @-@ delivery guy i dated .
who &apos;s victor ? we never heard about him .
oh , because i knew
you &apos;d never let me go out with an ex @-@ con .
hey , maybe it &apos;s dylan trying to win you back .
so , victor -- it &apos;s a closed door ?
maybe it &apos;s not a guy who &apos;s in love with haley .
oh , thank you .
maybe it &apos;s a guy who &apos;s obsessed with haley
and is getting plastic surgery to look like her
so he can replace her and live her life .
luke .
so they can only be for haley ?
of course not .
haley isn &apos;t the only hottie living here .
i washed the car in my cheer shorts the other day .
i definitely felt eyes on me .
has it ever occurred to you that those flowers could be for me ?
what do you mean ?
i mean , like , from my boyfriend .
what ?
you have a boyfriend ?
and you thought my thing was crazy .
alex , you have a boyfriend ?
you can &apos;t just drop that and ave .
honey , it is so exciting .
why didn &apos;t you tell us ?
because i knew you &apos;d get all weird
and ask a million stupid questions .
what does he look like ? how did you meet him ?
okay , i &apos;ll show you a photo .
well , i would , but now my phone &apos;s not working .
oh , here he is .
in the supermarket flyer ?
that &apos;s him pondering the pork chops ?
what &apos;s to ponder ?
they &apos;re $ 4.59 a pound .
i don &apos;t understand . why is he in this ?
he &apos;s a model , mom .
oh , wait , wait . your boyfriend &apos;s a model ?
well , how did you meet him ?
there &apos;s not much crossover
for a national honor society student and a pork model .
well , actually , it &apos;s a really long story . i ...
oh , well -- it &apos;s him .
hey , hold on .
this is terrific news .
i can &apos;t believe she didn &apos;t tell us about him .
oh , that &apos;s what you can &apos;t believe ?
what do you mean ?
phil , it is a little weird .
i mean , suddenly she has this boyfriend .
she wants to show us a picture on her phone ,
but she can &apos;t ,
and magically he &apos;s in today &apos;s paper ?
i don &apos;t even want to say it . haley .
she &apos;s making it up .
why would she do that ?
maybe she &apos;s upset
that none of us thought those roses could be for her .
oh , and remember
when she couldn &apos;t get a date for homecoming ?
she said she didn &apos;t care ,
but i caught her crying in her room .
oh , honey , what did you say to her ?
oh , i @-@ i was super late , so i didn &apos;t really ...
this is sad .
alex has great news
and her own mother and sister don &apos;t believe her ?
i want to .
well , i do believe her .
i &apos;m gonna tell her to invite this boyfriend over for dinner ,
and i &apos;ll be serving a big ,
old platter of &quot; i told you so . &quot;
oh , great .
maybe you could also serve unicorn burgers and magic beans ,
and i &apos;ll invite my boyfriend , bigfoot !
still better than dylan .
okay . i got a surprise for you .
it better not be another baby .
is there something fun behind the couch ?
an edgar vanderkoff hand @-@ crafted blanc de blanc sofa .
it was a wedding gift to ourselves .
plus , we &apos;re showing lily
that we trust her enough to let us have one nice thing .
when you think about it like that ,
it &apos;s really a gift for lily . yeah .
okay , whoa .
we only get on this couch when we know we &apos;re not dirty .
that &apos;s why we got her the couch .
to teach her about respect .
legs a little wider please .
is that a cookie in your back pocket ?
yep .
okay .
bup @-@ up @-@ up ! hey , nice and slow .
watching that .
but now that i got you here , what do you think ?
that you wore cargo shorts
to my middle @-@ school graduation ,
but you &apos;re putting on a bow tie
for some dog &apos;s birthday party .
it &apos;s all good fun .
the birnbaums can &apos;t have kids .
they like to do it up big for buster .
i had my fifth birthday in a break room
of a der wienerschnitzel , but good for buster .
why are you so cranky ?
this kid at school ripped me off for 40 bucks
in a pyramid scheme .
did this have something to do
with that broken plastic pyramid on your dresser ?
it looked like marble in the picture .
oh , man .
where were you when i was growing up ?
i &apos;d have had your dice and cigarettes
before you got to homeroom .
where &apos;d you go to school -- &quot; guys and dolls &quot; ?
bright as you are , you got to smarten up .
you got to be more suspicious of people .
stop being such a patsy .
how is this for the party ?
it &apos;s my first time meeting your dog @-@ park friends .
fantastic , but be careful --
some of these guys are single in the group .
what a surprise .
manny , we won &apos;t be late .
i left dinner for you and joe ,
but don &apos;t eat the deviled eggs that are in the refrigerator
because they &apos;re for tomorrow &apos;s picnic .
what picnic -- somebody &apos;s cat going to college ?
no , some of gloria &apos;s friends are getting their green cards .
it &apos;s actually a nice group .
yes , they &apos;re very decent , hardworking people .
jay met them at mirabelle &apos;s fake wedding .
zooboo !
no , you &apos;ve already watched &quot; zooboo &quot; six times today .
we &apos;re gonna watch a classic movie
right here on the big screen .
you better let him watch his show .
if not , he &apos;s gonna freak out .
yesterday i turned it off ,
and he bit through one of the pool balls .
hey , mitchell .
hi , uh , um ...
b ... renda .
yes , you thought i wasn &apos;t gonna remember , didn &apos;t you ?
so , how &apos;s your first week been ?
i &apos;m getting a divorce .
oh . god .
um ... well , i did ask , so ...
it &apos;s really hard to be alone , you know ?
yeah .
hey , you know who else who stays late is , um , stacey .
14 months .
oh , gosh .
well , sometimes it &apos;s good to get in and out fast , though , huh ?
we haven &apos;t had sex in 14 months .
we were married 20 years .
well , that &apos;s a nice , round number .
yeah .
my restless leg syndrome , like that &apos;s a reason to leave ?
well , you know , everybody has --
especially after all his habits and requests !
god ! i &apos;ve done more paddling
than lewis and clark !
hey , stace , you out there ?
oh , she &apos;s gone . people leave .
well , you know , i @-@ if there &apos;s anything
that i can do to help you --
could i stay with you ?
what &apos;s that ?
so , larry &apos;s allowed to sit on the couch and i &apos;m not ?
well , larry is white .
hey , you chose me .
oh , uh , that &apos;s not what i meant .
hello ?
hey , cam .
so , listen , you remember
my -- my new friend at work brenda , right ?
who ?
that &apos;s right -- the pretty one .
uh , so , she and her husband are -- are going through some problems at home ,
and she was wondering
if she might be able to stay at our house .
oh , my gosh . yes , of course .
oh , shoot and darn it !
i thought we had something .
mitchell , i know what you &apos;re doing .
ahh , there &apos;s no way we can reschedule , huh ?
fight your instincts .
this is a chance for you to show some real compassion .
i need a zoloft .
okay . okay .
well , i agree with all that ,
but i -- i am being nice !
okay ? i -- i @-@ i @-@ i talked to her .
i @-@ i asked her if there was anything i could do to help .
but i -- i didn &apos;t mean it .
nobody ever means it .
mitchell , you want this growth in your life .
that &apos;s why you asked her . you &apos;re just scared .
no , no , it was a completely hollow offer and --
yeah , that -- that &apos;s right .
okay , george and wendy hollow offer
dinner at 7 : 30 . okay , bye @-@ bye .
you need this , and i need something nice
to write about you in our christmas letter .
i love you , too . goodbye .
so ... bad news , huh ?
well , only if you hate home cooking .
you &apos;re the best ! - so --
i think you got some of my zoloft .
that &apos;s okay . i could use it .
bark mitzvah -- what a concept .
beagles and lox , dog briskets .
这里用了与狗狗相关的音似词
whoever &apos;s in charge of the wordplay , bravo .
is this for dogs or for people ?
i hope it &apos;s for people . i &apos;ve had four of them .
are you having fun ?
ay , yes .
before today , i had never seen a gravy fountain .
oh , gumdrop , look ! stella &apos;s here !
everybody , let &apos;s get a picture .
pupparazzi ! how great is that ?
everybody squeeze in .
be careful of her cysts . she &apos;ll nip you .
o @-@ okay .
okay , one more . doodles blinked .
now , really get tight this time .
no ! no , no , no !
enough . enough . - oh , gloria -- gloria .
gloria , honey , i -- listen .
i @-@ i know you &apos;re not a dog person .
no , i &apos;m okay with the dogs .
i &apos;m just not a dog @-@ person person .
you said that this party was going to be normal .
it &apos;s just fun .
there &apos;s a buffet and an open bar for dogs .
my cousin got married on a raft .
i tried to play along , jay ,
but -- but this is crazy .
i have to go home .
gloria , now , do you think it &apos;s fair
to use the word &quot; crazy &quot; about a --
i @-@ i &apos;ll see you at home , gloria .
oh , thank you so much , you guys .
god , where were you when i was
looking for the perfect man ?
well , probably in missouri
at a bar called kansas city meats
doing the same thing .
funny !
look at that smile .
what ?
that &apos;s what being nice feels like .
i like it .
i &apos;m proud of you .
well , i &apos;m just letting a person
i barely know sleep in my home .
i don &apos;t know if i &apos;d use the word &quot; hero , &quot; but ...
&quot; hero &quot; ?
stop it . you &apos;re embarrassing me .
oh , god .
hey , you guys have a cat ?
um , how about i freshen up that wine , huh ?
oh , no . i am good . okay , um ...
in fact , cam , what are --
what are we doing in the living room , here ?
you know ?
yeah , oh , you know what ?
we haven &apos;t even given brenda a tour of our ga-- uh , garage .
our -- our gage .
oh , no . i don &apos;t like garages .
that &apos;s where doug kept his precious sailboat .
no eating on the boat .
no drinking on the boat .
all because the one time i went on the boat , i spilled .
well , guess what . boats go like this .
oh , geez .
you know ? ! and i &apos;m like ...
who -- who loves a thing more than a person ?
a monster .
have we shown you our shed ?
there &apos;s a shed .
he knew what he was getting into when he married me .
i &apos;m a little messy .
well , guess what , doug !
life &apos;s a little messy .
okay , my sinuses leak , my -- my ears run ,
and i have hyperactive sweat glands , but ...
you know what ? i do need a refill .
well , i &apos;m not surprised . she &apos;s losing a lot of fluids .
it &apos;s as if doug was over here .
i know . i saw that .
alec !
his dumb dad got transferred to dumb africa
to operate on some dumb babies .
so fixing their hearts is worth breaking mine ?
it &apos;s kind of worth it .
he can do like six operations a day .
yeah . i @-@ i @-@ i understand . i &apos;m sorry i &apos;m lashing out .
i @-@ i just really like you .
i still like you .
you &apos;re making this worse .
bye , alec .
bye , alex .
i knew you couldn &apos;t leave without one last kiss !
we can work this out !
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m -- i &apos;m gonna regret that , aren &apos;t i ?
uh , i was hoping you could throw this away for me .
yeah . sure .
so , honey , we &apos;ve been talking ,
and we want to meet your boyfriend .
you just missed him .
he was here ?
he just left . this is his cup .
oh , look at that .
oh , it looks like &quot; alex . &quot;
his name is alec . the &quot; c &quot; just got smudged .
honey , his name is alec .
but the &quot; c &quot; got smudged .
yeah , um , well , why don &apos;t you just text him
and then invite him back for dinner ?
i can &apos;t . he broke up with me .
oh , no .
he &apos;s moving to africa .
because they need grocery models in africa .
honey , i &apos;m so sorry .
they broke up .
i miss him .
oh , don &apos;t worry .
soon it will be like he never existed .
okay .
ay dios mío , manny , what &apos;s going on with joe ?
he &apos;s a drug addict .
after two hours of mind @-@ liquefying &quot; zooboo , &quot;
i briefly put on a classic movie , and he freaked out .
if he could walk better ,
i &apos;d seriously suggest a 12 @-@ step program .
ay , no , joe . no more &quot; zooboo . &quot;
thank you .
ay , no . turn the big tv off .
if he sees it on , he &apos;s going to want to watch his show .
why are you home ?
buster &apos;s party was a bark mitzvah .
i don &apos;t know why jay would take me to this place .
i don &apos;t know .
maybe this dog stuff is his way
of trying to find a common interest with you .
it &apos;s hard .
you don &apos;t like golf or scotch
or eisenhower documentaries .
it &apos;s true . i don &apos;t like ike .
but the people in this party ,
they are so obsessed with dogs .
even the punch bowl was in the shape of a toilet .
well , it &apos;s not like jay
doesn &apos;t get out of his comfort zone for you .
he &apos;s going to your green @-@ card picnic tomorrow .
you &apos;re right .
he even bought star @-@ spangled sombreros for everybody .
it &apos;s the wrong country .
he never listens , but -- but he &apos;s sweet .
you know what ?
i should go back to that party .
you guys want to come ?
might as well .
they had a pretty good spread at buster &apos;s bris .
okay , let &apos;s get this woman into bed
and , in the morning , out of the house as fast as we can .
honestly , i don &apos;t know how straight guys do it .
probably without those hand gestures .
so , nice bath ?
oh , yeah , the best . i &apos;m so ready for bed .
okay . ooh , by the way , i left a ring in there .
oh , well , we &apos;ll get at it with some bleach in the morning .
no , no , no , my wedding ring .
i just don &apos;t feel like wearing it anymore .
oh , well , goodbye , bad memories ,
hello to our guest couch , the cloud .
that &apos;s a small cloud .
oh , you know what ? it &apos;s deceptively comfy .
i sleep on it all the time .
yeah , if i don &apos;t beat him to it first .
really ?
oh , okay . all right .
so , there you are .
okay .
okay , yeah .
i &apos;m not -- i &apos;m pretty sure this isn &apos;t gonna work .
no , no , this will be fine . this will be fine .
this is what i always do . it &apos;s not a big deal .
just make this up nice for you .
there we go . okay .
see you in the morning .
yeah , but my -- my head &apos;s --
oh . what we were thinking ?
here . come on . there it is right there .
there you go . okay . night @-@ night .
night @-@ night .
hey , guys .
here &apos;s an idea .
what if i just slept on your couch in the living room ?
i &apos;m shaking .
why ? problem solved .
no , she &apos;s making the whole house shake .
hey , guys . you &apos;re back ? what &apos;s going on ?
i &apos;m sorry . i love you , and you love dog parties .
so that means that i love dog parties .
you don &apos;t think it &apos;s crazy anymore ?
i didn &apos;t say that .
but manny &apos;s right .
we should get more involved in each other &apos;s activities .
so , this was your idea ?
well , it &apos;s sort of the foundation of any healthy marriage ,
but i did bring it up .
this is great !
well , come on . give me a hand .
we &apos;ll grab you and your mom an ice @-@ cream bone .
i didn &apos;t do much . i just --
ruined my plan , that &apos;s all .
i wanted her to leave !
what ?
she was supposed to storm out of here .
and after , i go home and say ,
&quot; maybe we should do some things separately . &quot;
i was gonna use her bailing out of this
as a chip to get out of that stupid picnic tomorrow .
but now i &apos;ve got no chip .
hey , how about next time you devise a plan
to avoid expressing a feeling , clue me in .
you can &apos;t be clued in . you &apos;re a patsy .
hey , um , there was talk of an ice @-@ cream bone ?
i made that up , too . use your head !
hey , honey , you alone ?
do you see anyone else in here ?
do you ?
sweetheart , your father and i think we owe you an apology .
for what ?
well , this morning when we didn &apos;t think
the rose could be for you ,
it seemed like maybe it hurt your feelings .
i guess . a little .
i am so sorry to make you feel bad .
and it is completely believable
that you would have an admirer .
okay .
what we &apos;re worried about
is that we have created an environment
in which you feel it &apos;s necessary to ...
embelli--
fanta--
exagger--
oh , my god .
you guys don &apos;t think alec is real ?
sweetheart , i remember the pressure there was
to fit in in high school .
so do i. and whether you try to fit in
by saying you fought a baby bear
or by making up a boyfriend ...
you guys are so unbelievable .
you really think i &apos;m that pathetic
that i &apos;d have to create some imaginary boyfriend ?
you know what &apos;s not imaginary ?
your feelings .
okay , don &apos;t ! don &apos;t !
f.y.i. , i changed my facebook
status to &quot; single &quot;
about an hour ago , and guess what .
i already have a date .
you don &apos;t believe me , do you ?
sweetheart , you &apos;ve had two boyfriends in 30 seconds .
that practically haley &apos;s record .
well , he &apos;s real . his name is teddy .
his name is ... teddy ?
yeah .
teddy keyes .
and what do we know about this young man ?
he &apos;s new to our school .
he works at some mattress store -- mattress king .
and he &apos;s a bit of a bad boy .
he had a little problem with shoplifting .
he spent some time in juvie .
but , you know , he &apos;s not really my type .
he &apos;s just a rebound .
so i guess it doesn &apos;t really matter .
why am i even talking to you guys ?
leave !
get out !
did you see the look in her eyes ?
like she believed everything she was saying .
that &apos;s terrifying . like this guy i knew in college .
he was always telling me about these &quot; crazy parties &quot;
that were &quot; full of women . &quot;
but when i &apos;d ask him where they were ,
he &apos;d give me a fake address .
makes me wonder what else she &apos;s making up .
i have never met that girl she turtors in math .
esther choi ? me neither .
because she doesn &apos;t exist !
there is not an esther choi on earth
who needs math tutoring .
she needs help , claire .
what do we do ?
i mean , should we send her back to that therapist ?
the one we &apos;ve never met ?
no ! wait !
don &apos;t open it ! move away !
it &apos;s for me ! move !
damn . you look hot .
the roses are from you , teddy ?
yeah , i met a guy in juvie who works at the cemetery .
they got flowers all over the place .
oh , i also got you this .
sweet . let &apos;s go .
my other one of these cracked ,
so you can use this one .
okay .
yes ! our little girl isn &apos;t crazy !
teddy &apos;s real !
real freaky !
i &apos;m going !
cam , you &apos;re snoring .
what ? sorry .
was that me ?
oh , my god . oh , my god .
what is she doing out here ?
well , she has that restless leg .
both of them ?
oh , my gosh , get the ice cream !
what do we do ? should we wake her up ?
and say what ?
&quot; would you mind terribly getting off our couch ?
you seem to be glazing it . &quot;
do you have a better idea ?
okay , okay , go around the back .
what am i doing ? what am i doing ?
we &apos;ll get this underneath her .
once , i helped a sow give birth to nine baby piglets
on our living room floor .
didn &apos;t get a drop of nothin &apos; on the linoleum .
we &apos;re gonna get back to why the sow was in the living room .
lady di &apos;s wedding . it was beautiful .
cam , she &apos;s gonna wake up .
oh , please , she &apos;s got enough pills in her ,
she &apos;s gonna rattle like a maraca .
roll !
doug , no , i don &apos;t wanna .
okay , okay , what do i do ? what do i do ?
you come back around this way .
no , doug .
now , what we &apos;re gonna do is i &apos;ll push her this way
and pull the blanket .
okay , i got to pull her ? okay .
i &apos;m losing her . i &apos;m losing her .
this could work , too . it &apos;s fine .
what -- what happened ?
you were having a really bad dream ,
and then you rolled right off
of our uncomfortable sofa .
i &apos;m sorry . i @-@ i was lonely .
i came out here ,
and then i wound up waking up the whole house .
i &apos;m the worst houseguest in the world !
don &apos;t .
don &apos;t .
doug was right . i &apos;m gonna die alone .
don &apos;t .
don &apos;t .
okay , come on .
can you please be quiet ?
i &apos;m so sorry , lily . it &apos;s all my fault .
my head hurts .
i &apos;m gonna get you some aspirin .
okay .
cam , are we terrible people ?
for protecting a vanderkoff ?
he hanged himself last year .
it &apos;s not like they &apos;re making more of those .
we just rolled a bipolar divorcee
face @-@ first onto a hardwood floor .
all to protect a couch .
it &apos;s not just a couch . our one nice thing .
the last seven years have been about sticky countertops
and horsy shower curtains and childproof locks .
do you know what &apos;s in this drawer ?
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s in this drawer .
i have no idea .
look , i know it &apos;s frustrating , all right ?
but is that really a reason to choose a thing over a person ?
i mean , come on . we &apos;re no better than doug .
i guess it &apos;s not a great example to set for lily .
maybe we don &apos;t deserve one nice thing .
&quot; and when the sun came out , all the turtles ,
from abner to zeke , had fun at the picnic . &quot;
&quot; a rainy day for turtles . &quot;
it always makes lily feel better .
i guess she just thought that ...
we do have one nice thing .
&quot; and a beautiful rain-- &quot;
well , we don &apos;t have to watch it die . come on .
let &apos;s go , jay !
we &apos;re supposed to be at the picnic in 20 minutes !
they &apos;ve been living in a van for six years .
they can wait a little longer .
so , today , instead of watching the game ,
i &apos;ll be playing lawn darts with colombians ,
thanks to you not using your brain .
here we go -- &quot; the sting . &quot;
well , someone &apos;s getting what they want today .
you finally get to watch your precious movie , huh ?
&quot; a classic tale about a long con . &quot;
well , you &apos;re welcome .
wait a minute .
&quot; rogues and double @-@ crossers abound .
who will outsmart whom ? &quot;
son of a bitch .
you knew i was using the bark mitzvah
as a bargaining chip .
that &apos;s why you talked gloria into coming back --
so i couldn &apos;t weasel my way out of this stupid picnic
and you &apos;d get the big tv .
well , i &apos;m onto you now .
i was just reading off the dvd box .
i mean , can you believe
all the stuff brenda brought for one night ?
i know . look at all this stuff over here .
super replenishing balm ?
uh , pore @-@ reducing booster serum ?
anti @-@ aging buffing beads ?
it must be so hard to be a girl .
i know . i know .
it really makes you worry about the world
we &apos;re sending lily out into .
well , there &apos;s so much pressure on girls to be perfect .
you ready ?
yep .
the thing is , cam ,
all we can do is instill our beliefs in her
and hope that she makes good choices .
calming mister ?
it does feel nice to talk about it .
no , this is a calming mister .
i just bought this .
oh , god , yes .
wanna try it ?
