Hey, Dad.
Dad...
I don't need a whole speech on what a user our birth mother is.
That doesn't mean I can't feel bad for her.
Take some parenting classes and get my baby girl back.
You have a kid?
She's two. In a foster care like I was.
I'm gonna get her back. My little Tasha.
One minute, you're just cruising along,
next minute? someone swoops in and kills your dream.
I'm never gonna get adopted.
You don't know that.
Maybe this is the way it's supposed to be.
I gave up so much to be adopted.
We can't do this.
But I'm not getting adopted.
You don't know that.
I love you.
Brandon, I love you.
I have to think about this...
I have to...
Uh... what exactly is that?
It's the Grinch.
I made it in kindergarten.
Were you blindfolded?
Oh, look.. Baby's first Christmas.
Ohh, look at you.
I wonder who these are for.
Hmm, I wonder...
I wonder...
You guys are our babies
and this is your first Christmas with us.
Photo op! Let's see what's in mine!
Hold 'em up. Hold 'em up there and say "Cha-cha"!
Cha-cha.
Photo bomb!
We need more decorations.
We have all of Frank's plus ours.
Gramps's are old-fashioned.
Mr.Nesbit next door, just blew up a giant snowman.
If we're gonna win, we need inflatables.
Win what?
The contest.
What contest?
The homeowners' association.
They give out prizes every year
to the best decorated house in the neighborhood.
They give you a sign to put in your yard
and then on Christmas Day the
judges come around and they hand out prizes.
First place gets $250.
Well, you gotta spend money to make money. How much you need?
Oh, no way, lady. Huh-uh!
We're not spending any more money on Christmas decorations.
We have plenty.
You're not the boss of Grandma.
No, I'm not, but I am the boss of you.
Your mom's right. Just work
with what we've got and use your imagination.
I don't have an imagination.
That's true. You know what he got me last year for Christmas?
What?
A vibrating tooth brush from the 99-cent Store.
You sure it was a tooth brush?
Ok.
I'm just saying if he's my Secret Santa this year,
my Christmas is going to suck.
Language.
What's with our tree? There's something missing.
Presents?
I mean, come on, Secret Santas are for people who work in a bank.
Mother.
It's a good thing that Santa Claus is coming to town.
Mm! Tinsel. We need tinsel.
OK, you know what, Mother,
I hope you didn't go overboard this year with the presents.
I did not. But I can't speak for St. Nick.
OK, hey, listen, everybody.
You know, this year, Christmas is about spiritual not material.
OK? It's not about the presents.
It's about being together.
We've been blessed with Jude and Callie in our lives,
and we don't need a stinking
piece of paper to make it official, do we?
We're family. And I'll tell you what,
this motley crew is the best present I could ever ask for.
Amen.
Amen!
Oh, I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry!
I hope the judge throws the book at that Vito thug.
Vico.
Vico.
What kinda made up name is that?
Someone's here for Callie.
Hello.
I'm from the Mission Bay Giving Tree
and we're donating gifts to foster kids.
Is Callie Jacob here?
Yeah, I'm Callie.
We hope you have a Merry Christmas
and find a forever family very soon.
Happy holidays.
Thank you.
OK, let's get this cleaned
up and take these boxes to the garage, please.
What am I supposed to do with this?
I mean, I've never gotten a pity present before.
We always get them.
But you're adopted.
Well, yeah, but our names are still on some list somewhere.
And they come with no return address
so we don't know who to call.
So you just keep them?
Um... we put 'em under the tree and open them on Christmas day.
But then Moms make us donate them.
Which kinda sucks because sometimes we get good stuff.
I guess that's what I'll do then.
Hey, have you got your gift yet?
No.
Do you wanna do some last minute Christmas shopping?
Yes, please.
How did Jude take it? I mean, that must have been a shock
for him to find out he and Callie have different dads.
Yeah, it was.
I think it was hard for him to get adopted without Callie,
but it doesn't change how close they are.
Sharon, there's a UPS truck out front.
Oh, thank God! I was so afraid the gifts wouldn't arrive in time.
I sincerely hope that she did not go crazy this year.
She can't afford to spend like this.
Well, just be grateful that your mom is here.
Have you spoken to Dana?
No, and I'm not going to as long as they're with him.
I mean...
If they wanna let Nathan back in their lives, that's fine.
That's their business, but...
... choosing to spend Christmas with him instead of us?
It's... it's just so insulting.
I'm sorry, love.
It is what it is.
You know, I'm not gonna let it ruin my holiday.
I really have got to go through these boxes.
How long am I supposed to keep my father's bank statements?
Can they audit a dead person?
They can audit the estate.
Estate, that's funny. What estate?
Well, he did give us a car, you know.
With his entire savings I'm sure.
He had to have had some money.
On a policeman's pension? That's funny. Let's see...
Uh... when he died,
he had exactly $300.52 in his checking account,
a few thousand in his savings, that's impressive,
And a money market with...
Am I reading this right?
What?
Am I reading that right?
$150,000? Did you know about this?
Do I look like I knew about this?
Well, where is it?
I have no idea. The probate lawyer did not mention it.
Well, maybe Frank didn't want you to know about it.
Why? Why?
Maybe he left it to the church?
Well, who else would he leave it to, if not you?
What do you think of the tree now?
Well, you can't buy much with a $40 limit.
Which is why we're not at the mall.
So, come on, you can tell me who you got.
No way.
Fine. I won't tell you either then.
But, you know, just for the hell of it, is this your style?
No. No. I'm not really a cuff girl.
I see.
But this is pretty.
A hundred dollars?
Pretty expensive. Hm.
Need any help?
Now this is the perfect gift for you.
A kitchen table?
Don't you remember, it was the first thing you wanted to buy
for your Independent Living apartment?
Even over a flat screen TV.
Or a couch.
As I recall, the floor was pretty comfortable, but...
Well, if we wanna keep this
Secret Santa thing secret, we better split up.
That's a good idea.
How could you not tell me?
Well...
maybe I just didn't want you to take it personally.
Take what, personally?
That I attract abundance in my life.
Mom, you didn't attract this.
You inherited $150,000
because Dad never got around to changing his will after the divorce.
Maybe he chose not to.
You know Frank was very tight with a buck.
He could count every penny he ever made.
Yes, and he could also procrastinate.
I have a garage full of
boxes he never sorted through to prove it.
Stef, it is what it is.
Would you stop saying that?
We have five kids to support, Lena,
an... and put through college.
I highly doubt that Dad intended to leave his money to a woman
he was no longer married to and really didn't get along with.
Hey, you know I'm right here.
Yes, Mom. OK.
Look, no offense, but Dad
did not approve of the way you spent money.
Dad, or you?
No, don't answer that, all right?
There's three things that a family shouldn't discuss at Christmastime:
Politics, religion, and money.
And a woman's real age.
So let's just nip it in the bud
before somebody actually does take offense.
I thought it could help you get over your fear of little dogs.
Hey, that was on the down low.
Well, Merry Christmas.
I got something for you too.
Wow, just what I've always wanted. A job application.
I talked to my boss and he's hirin'
and you said you wanted to make some money.
Oh, totally. That would be fun.
We'd get to work together.
I'll ask my... Stef and Lena.
You mean your moms?
I'm not adopted yet.
Which I was reminded of when this lady from some charity came by
to give the poor foster kid a present.
So you gonna feel sorry for
yourself cause somebody gave you a present?
You got people, OK?
You heard from your social worker?
No.
I'm sure you will.
Tasha's gonna be turning two.
I've done everything I'm supposed to
and they still won't give me visitation.
I can't even give my baby girl a Christmas present.
Well, do you get pictures at least?
No. Not even.
But I seen her.
Where?
At the park, near where she lives with her foster lady.
How do you know where she lives?
Social worker had her folder on the desk.
If they find out that you've been, like, stalking her,
you'll never get visitation.
I'm not stalking her.
She's my kid.
As long as she's in the system,
she belongs to the state.
Look, you just gotta be patient.
Just keep doing everything right and
you'll get to see her. But don't go back to that park.
Ok.
What's this?
A list of gifts under $40 you can get me.
Just in case you drew my name.
Don't worry, I didn't.
Well, just keep that list for future reference then.
Hey. Hey, you're, like, crafty, right?
I prefer "Artistic."
Moms won't give me any money for any more decorations,
so I need to, like, make some or something.
OK, hold up. You do not need any more decorations.
It's not about quantity, it's quality.
You need a theme. Your decorations should tell a story.
That's why I need you. Please?
What if I give you the $40 instead of getting you a gift?
I knew you drew me.
Come on, Mariana.
OK, but I'm not doing any manual labor
and I also want a 20 percent commission if you win.
Fine.
Oh, I'm not done.
I also want total creative control and final cut.
We're not making a movie.
Those are my terms.
OK.
I want it in writing.
I can't believe she's not the least bit chagrined
about inheriting Dad's money.
Can we please stop talking about this?
I mean, you know she's just gonna flush it right down the toilet.
You know what she got the kids for Christmas?
She got them electric skateboards and Go-Pros.
What the heck is that?
How do you know?
I may have un-taped the little corners of some of the presents.
Stef?
What? I taped them back.
She's never gonna know.
What are we getting?
I don't know.
The point is that...
They don't need the top ten gadgets of the year.
What they need is a college education.
There is nothing that you can do about this.
And I hate to say this,
but you are starting to sound a little bit petty.
Oh, I sound petty? Well that's interesting.
You're the one who won't talk to your own mother
because she's spending Christmas with your brother.
Half-brother.
Half-brother?
Have you seen the jingle bell napkin rings?
Does it make a difference?
Yes. I want the table to look festive.
No. I'm talking about Nathan.
Really?
We don't have the same mother. So yes, it makes a difference.
You can say that it doesn't. But half is not full.
I think they're in the garage.
Found them.
Would you care to reconsider what you said about half-siblings?
Especially in a house of adopted kids?
What did I say?
That half isn't the same as full.
I meant...
I meant a full sibling who you grow up with.
Who you live in the same house with.
I barely knew Nathan.
Why are you so hurt about something he said once in anger?
Once, to my mother's face.
Who knows how many times he said it behind her back?
She's forgiven him.
Well, I have not.
It's a word.
A hateful word.
Yes. An ugly, horrible word.
And you know what, I've had people call me a dyke to my face,
who I know in their hearts aren't homophobic.
So what are you saying? Hate the word, not the hater?
I'm... I'm just saying that
sometimes people use hateful words
because they hurt not because they hate.
And he was so young and...
you know, people grow up, grow wiser, kinder.
And, uh, holding a grudge makes you...
What?
Makes you say hurtful things...
... that I think Jude may have overheard.
Where's your brother?
Which one?
The pretty one with the unibrow.
Jesus?
What's going on?
You tell me.
Somebody slashed this inflatable snowman.
Well, it wasn't me.
Now listen here, sonny.
I've won this contest three years in a row
and I never had any problem with vandals
until you decided to enter.
So be warned,
I will sit up all night
to protect my decorations and my property.
And anyone who trespasses
will have me and the end of a baseball bat to contend with.
You didn't...?
No.
Well, now that we're getting death threats,
I might want to renegotiate my contract.
You know, for hazard pay.
Who's that for?
I won't tell.
Callie.
Can I see?
It's gorgeous.
I wanted to get her something nice, since...
... she didn't get adopted and stuff.
And you got this for $40?
Well, Callie sure is lucky
to have a brother with such good taste.
You know, I have a brother.
I don't talk about him very much.
Well, at all, really.
And why not?
Well, my dad was married before he met my mom.
And he and his first wife had a son named Nathan.
And we didn't live in the same house.
So we didn't get to share all those bonding experiences that
make siblings close.
Is that why you don't talk about him?
Because you didn't grow up together?
No. It's more complicated than that.
You see, he lived in another state with his mom
and when he did come to visit...
... he wasn't...
... he wasn't very nice.
Well maybe he was jealous,
because you got to live with your dad and he didn't.
You know, I think...
I think maybe you're right.
Grandma and G-Pa aren't coming this year
because they're spending Christmas with him.
And I think...
I don't know, I think maybe I was...
... feeling a little jealous myself.
And it made me say some things that I really don't mean.
Anyway...
You know, Callie is going to love that bracelet.
But I hope you know you don't have to make up
for her not getting adopted or for anything
with a special gift.
She loves you
and you're special enough.
Um, excuse me?
I was looking at this bracelet yesterday,
and I guess I put it in my pocket and forgot to pay.
So anyways, I just...
I wanted to bring it back and say I'm sorry.
Do you want to pay for it now?
Um... How much is it again?
A hundred bucks.
Yeah, that's a little over my budget.
So, sorry.
Wait... a minute.
What's your budget?
Forty bucks.
You're lucky. This bracelet just went on sale.
60 percent off.
Are... are you sure?
I'm sure.
But you better fork over the cash before the sale ends.
Happy Kwanzaa.
S'up?
Hey, uh, so my moms invited you to come over tomorrow for Christmas.
We're just gonna eat and watch movies.
Sound good?
Please come.
OK. Thanks. What time?
Anytime.
All right. See ya tomorrow.
Tasha.
Doesn't everybody look lovely.
Stefanie, how nice to see you in a dress.
Thank you, Mother.
I do, actually, wear dresses often.
I wasn't implying you don't.
Really?
What are these?
It's a Lena thing. Just go with it.
Put them on, let me see.
Let me see.
What did you get, Jude?
It's a bow tie.
Bow tie! Oh, handsome. Look at you.
Very festive. Very nice.
Hey, where's mine? What did I get this year?
You look fantastic.
For you my love,
straight from the hutch.
That's a very fancy box.
Lena Adams Foster...
Do you like them?
They're beautiful.
Let me see!
Diamond earrings?!
I want diamond earrings.
Are you sure you like them?
No... Yes, I do.
I do, I just...
I just hope they're not real.
Oh, Stefanie, what a thing to say. Of course they're real.
I mean they are, aren't they?
Yes. Yes, they're real.
How many karats?
I just, I meant that I hoped they were not too expensive.
That's what I meant.
Honey, after the year you've had,
I thought you deserved something nice.
Don't be such a cheapskate, just put 'em on.
Put them on!
We said that we were not giving each other gifts this year.
No, but it's OK.
It's not OK.
It's OK.
It's not OK. I didn't get you anything.
Well, I'm just glad that someone living in this house
has an abundant mind set.
Don't you mean an abundant debt, Mom?
I mean, after all, isn't that
how you were able to afford electric skateboards
and extravagant beds that we don't even want?
We're getting electric skateboards?
It wasn't extravagant. It was a wedding gift.
OK. Just inappropriate.
Stef, come on.
I mean, a bed is a very personal thing.
And not only did you buy us a bed without asking us,
but you got rid of the one that we love.
Look, if you don't like the bed, please...
We don't. We don't.
Not everybody likes memory foam.
And, you know, it's practically ruined our sex life,
with the up and the down and the thing in the middle...
Is something burning?
I mean, what would you think, Mom,
if I went into your underwear drawer and I, say,
threw away all of your favorite pairs
and filled it with nothing but thongs, hmm?
Well, actually, I wear nothing but thongs anyway. Want to see?
No, Mother, I don't want to see your thong.
The point is, Mom, is
it's a very personal and inappropriate gift.
That's it.
I'm sorry.
But I have to say,
I think you could use some new underwear.
I was folding the laundry and I
couldn't help but notice yours are very sensible.
Maybe that's part of the sex problem.
You know what? It's not funny, Mom.
This is not funny.
You're telling me?
I'm the one who's got hurt feelings here.
Well... burnt the lasagna.
Honey, I'm sure that it's fine.
No, it's not fine! It's not fine.
And I'm sorry that I bought you a gift.
And I'm sorry that your dad didn't leave you his money.
And I'm sorry that we didn't like the bed.
But I'm trying to have a nice holiday
and you and your mother are ruining it!
Honey...
I'm so sorry. It's a bad time.
Merry Christmas.
Don't get up.
Let's just eat.
I'm sorry, love. I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
It's not that we don't appreciate your generosity, Mom.
I am just worried about my kids,
and college, and you,
when you get old and have nothing to live on.
Oh, for heaven's sake, Stefanie.
I tried. I tried to apologize.
Can we maybe, like, cut around the burned part?
Open it.
I don't want to open another present, Mother.
Just open it!
What is it?
It's, uh...
... college...
college investment accounts for, uh...
... for all of you.
Did you think I was going to keep all Frank's money for myself?
You could have told me, Mom.
I wanted it to be a surprise.
If you haven't heard, tomorrow's Christmas.
Well, I feel like an idiot.
Every village has one.
Yes, it does.
I know you've been under a lot of pressure. I know that.
You're doing a great job, OK?
You just have to have faith that the universe will provide.
Where do you think Frank got all that money?
I invested it.
I was in on the dot-com boom.
You don't have to worry about me.
I have plenty to live on in my old age.
Thank you, Mom. Thank you.
Thank you so much.
And I love the earrings.
I'm sorry.
It's OK.
Jude and Callie,
what do you think of your first Fosters Christmas?
我需要你 凯丽 打给我
Daphne?
Daphne?
I didn't go there planning to take her, I was just freakin' out.
What did the social worker say?
They want to adopt her. That's why I haven't got visitation.
Can she talk?
I mean, can she tell people who took her?
No.
Callie you can't get involved in this.
You're still on probation.
What if we dropped her at a fire station?
No. That's, like, for infants.
Not kids who've been kidnapped.
And any safe place we take her they're gonna use cameras.
He's right.
You can't get involved.
I shouldn't have never called you.
No, I'm already involved. But you should go.
Yeah, like I'm gonna leave you here
and go home like nothing happened.
You said you know where Tasha lives?
Jeez, you scared me.
I brought you some hot cocoa.
Thanks.
I can't believe you're sleeping outside.
People are stealing decorations.
Well, this is comfy.
It's just for the night.
So, listen.
I was thinking about what I said earlier
about you giving terrible gifts.
Wait, when did you say that?
Maybe you weren't there.
Thanks a lot.
Well look, anyway, um...
this being Jude and Callie's first Christmas with us
got me thinking about our first Christmas.
Or, well, our last Christmas with Ana.
Or without her. Since she
went out to get high and never come back.
We were five years old, and we spent Christmas all alone.
Why are you thinking about that?
Because...
I was scared and sad and...
you made me feel better.
Even though you must have been scared and sad, too.
And you still always try to make me feel better.
And, well, that's a pretty awesome gift.
So I just wanted to say thank you.
So...
So... you're gonna keep me company?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
I don't sleep outdoors. But happy camping.
That's the house.
At least there aren't any cop cars.
I'll take her.
Callie?
No.
I gotta do this.
Drive around the corner.
Wait like, five minutes and if I don't come, take off.
It's OK, baby, it's OK.
Look at me. Look at me.
Hey, keep this, OK?
Take this with you and go to the door
and you knock, OK?
Go on, take this with you, OK? Knock on the door.
Tasha!
You!
I see you bums! Get outta here!
Get out!
No! Don't swing, don't swing! Don't swing!
They broke my baby Jesus.
What?
I have to admit, you did a nice job on your house.
I like the theme.
It's very... now.
I have to give my sister credit for that.
You know in my day, families all had a mom and a dad.
And everybody all looked the same.
And if you had an adopted kid, it was like a secret.
You didn't tell anyone.
It didn't matter how you all came together,
it's just nice to have a big family.
Especially around the holidays.
What about your family?
I got three kids, all grown, scattered about the country.
Since my wife died, they don't make it out every year.
They've got their own kids, you know,
and they want to be home Christmas.
Why don't you go see them?
They ask me...
... but I wanna be home, too.
And anyway, I've got the contest.
And I hate to break my winning streak.
Although I think I got some competition this year.
Your house looks great, too.
Yeah.
I don't think those punks'll be
back to mess with the likes of us.
Hey, thanks for the cocoa.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
Very funny, Mom.
Not for you kids to see.
Well, I certainly wouldn't want to get you anything personal.
I think there's one for you,
Sharon.
Yes there is. Right there.
Oh, thank you. What could this be?
Frank's ashes?
Mom! Oh, my gosh.
He definitely weighed more than that.
How did you afford this?
It was on sale.
For real.
I love it. Thank you.
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas.
I'm so happy you called.
Oh! We miss you all.
We miss you, too.
Hold on. Let me put your father on the phone.
Actually... can you put Nathan on the phone?
Just a minute.
Hi, Lena.
Hi Nathan...
Merry Christmas.
Who's that from?
Wyatt.
Whoa, cool.
Wow. Those are the foster presents?
Yeah.
How did they know our names?
I thought they only knew
if you were a boy or girl and how old you are.
Can we keep them this year?
Um, sure.
What're you doing out here?
I'm not really feeling the Christmas spirit.
I guess I can just return this then.
Well, I'm definitely feeling presents.
Here.
Here, let me...
Do you love it?
... yeah.
It's... it's awesome.
You can wear it when you play for the Junior Symphony.
Yeah...
There might not be any symphony.
Or piano for that matter.
Brandon, you can't think like that.
What if I'd given up and gone into Independent Living?
I'd have a kitchen table without a family to sit around it.
You really think I'd get you a cheesy tie?
It's not, that, cheesy.
Yeah, you are a terrible liar.
I love it.
For real.
Let's promise each other,
that no matter how many set backs
or and stuff that gets in our way...
... we never let each other give up on our dreams.
Come on, let's go.
OK, let's go.
Out of the way, please.
