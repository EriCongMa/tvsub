the only thing stronger than your craving for blood
is your love for this one girl .
turn it off .
no !
turn it off !
what did you do ?
i fixed him .
klaus is gone .
but he &apos;s asked me to keep watch on you until he returns .
from now on , you &apos;re under my protection .
it &apos;s kind of a push and pull .
i &apos;m pushing from the other side trying to contact you ,
and sometimes , like just now , if you pull ...
bonnie , stop dodging my calls .
why are you thinking about me when you &apos;re calling her ?
i don &apos;t think i can stop thinking about you .
who &apos;s the guy with carol ?
mason lockwood .
mason lockwood is a werewolf .
he &apos;d kill me the first chance he got .
this is going to be fun .
oh , you got to be kidding me .
hurts , doesn &apos;t it ?
oh , stefan !
low blow , stefan .
low blow .
what the hell happened to you ?
whatever twisted ripper game this is ,
leave me out of it .
i didn &apos;t do this .
quit screwin &apos; around !
i didn &apos;t .
it &apos;s pretty messed up though , isn &apos;t it ?
yep .
yeah ,
not to worry . i &apos;ll just untangle myself .
as a long @-@ time member of the historical society ,
i am especially proud to be kicking off this day of festivities .
thank you , volunteers .
tonight , we turn off our town &apos;s lights and flare up our lanterns
in honor of the night of illumination
started by our founders 150 years ago .
here &apos;s founding family member tobias fell with a history lesson .
what are we doing here ?
tobias fell is the head of the history department .
i didn &apos;t have a choice .
all right , that explains what you &apos;re doing here .
well , i &apos;m the one who can fail you if you don &apos;t help me out .
hey , sorry i &apos;m late . what did i miss ?
just a bunch of historical lies .
you didn &apos;t miss anything .
the first illumination was held in celebration
with the new found prosperity
that mystic falls enjoyed after the war .
after the founders stole from all the vampires .
what &apos;s so funny ?
... to indicate that it was
safe for their neighbors to come outside again .
safe from the vampires .
so when you did the spell to send vicki away ,
did that get rid of anna , too ?
i wish . all i did was block the magic that was helping
vicki get a physical foothold here .
jeremy &apos;s still got a direct line to the other side ,
and as long as he wants to see anna and she wants to see him ,
she &apos;s still here .
ok , you don &apos;t think i can actually resist commenting on that .
there . you commented .
bonnie ...
what do you want me to say , caroline ?
i went against the balance
of nature when i brought jeremy back to life ,
and now i &apos;m paying the consequences .
well , i want you to say you &apos;re not ok with it .
i &apos;m a thousand times not ok with it .
i just don &apos;t know what to do about it .
greetings , blondie .
witchy .
i think you got your voodoo wires all crossed
when you got rid of vicki donovan .
what do you mean , why ?
because i &apos;m pretty sure i just got spit @-@ roasted
by mason lockwood &apos;s ghost .
what ?
and why would you think that ?
maybe because he chained me to a chair
and shoved a hot poker in my chest .
let &apos;s just say i &apos;m having deja vu .
i thought you said that
ghosts couldn &apos;t physically interact with people .
they can &apos;t .
yeah , well ,
i don &apos;t have time for a vengeful lockwood .
when i kill someone , they &apos;re supposed to stay dead .
whatever you screwed up , fix it .
hey , jer , i need you to help me with something .
what &apos;s up ?
i &apos;ve been going through stefan &apos;s old journals .
every single time that he &apos;s gone off the rails in the past ,
his best friend lexi &apos;s been the one to bring him back .
so where is she now that we need her ?
she &apos;s dead .
and you want me to try to reach her , don &apos;t you ?
i thought if i knew how she did it , maybe i could help him .
i don &apos;t even know if she &apos;s on the other side .
is that what it &apos;s called ?
that &apos;s what anna calls it .
there &apos;s not like an official brochure or anything .
so what is it , like some sort of supernatural purgatory ?
well , anna said it &apos;s like being here with all of us ,
only we can &apos;t see her or hear her .
and she can &apos;t interact with anyone .
she &apos;s all alone .
vicki could interact . she blew up my car .
vicki had help from a witch on the other side .
anna ... she &apos;s doing this all by herself .
i &apos;m just saying , maybe we
learned our lesson about summoning dead people .
i haven &apos;t seen vicki , i swear .
i sent her back like you told me to .
are you sure ? because she has just as much reason
to haunt damon as mason lockwood does .
she &apos;s gone , bonnie . if she was here , i &apos;d know it .
why do you think it &apos;s vicki and not mason ?
because if any ghost other than vicki donovan
has a physical foothold on our side ,
then that means damon &apos;s right and something
has gone really , really wrong .
i &apos;ve had enough of this ghost stuff to last forever .
so you guys can leave me out of this one .
i feel so sad for him .
it took a lot for him to send his sister away .
yeah .
so much strength as a man .
i &apos;ve got a ghost problem to deal with , caroline .
save the jeremy lecture for later .
ok , did your grimoire just ...
i think so .
ok , please tell me that &apos;s a recipe for witch cookies .
it &apos;s a manifestation spell .
it &apos;s used to reveal veiled matter .
what &apos;s veiled matter ?
ghosts .
do you think it &apos;s even possible to contact lexi ?
i don &apos;t know .
i didn &apos;t have an emotional connection with her .
i never even met her .
can we just drop it , please ?
no , i can &apos;t drop it , ric .
i don &apos;t know what else to do .
don &apos;t you think we have
a few too many dead vampires in our past
to be sitting here thinking of them watching us ?
i don &apos;t think all supernatural spirits go to the other side .
i think some of them find peace .
is anna here right now ?
don &apos;t tell her i &apos;m here . she won &apos;t like it .
no , no . i &apos;m going to go , uh ,
check my work schedule .
hey , guys .
who forgot to invite me to the family summit ?
all these words .
i forgot how much i used to care .
i didn &apos;t .
you know , elena , it &apos;s probably best
you not torture yourself with memories from the past .
it &apos;s best we both just move on
and accept things as they are .
you don &apos;t have to be here , stefan .
you know what , alaric , you &apos;re right . i don &apos;t .
ahem . but elena &apos;s here , and i look out for elena .
besides , there &apos;s going to be people everywhere tonight .
so there &apos;s going to be lots to eat .
i &apos;m kidding , i &apos;m kidding .
loosen up .
i can &apos;t drop it , ric .
so this is where you brought jeremy back to life .
yeah .
sorry , i know it &apos;s creepy ,
but we needed a private place around here to do the spell .
hmm . there &apos;s no chance it &apos;s haunted by the hundred dead witches
who were horrifically burned to death in this very spot , is there ?
they &apos;re not here anymore .
and they made it clear they were never coming back .
right .
a pinkie swear ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
why did you tell me to lie ?
elena is bonnie &apos;s best friend .
she won &apos;t like what &apos;s going on between us .
what is going on between us ?
ok , how are we able to touch ?
vicki had to use magic to do that .
i don &apos;t know . honestly , i have no idea .
this witch on the other side that gave vicki her foothold ,
is she helping you now ?
what ? no !
i &apos;m all alone , jeremy , i told you that .
swear to me .
i swear .
i &apos;m not any danger to you or anybody , i promise .
i need you to believe me .
i shouldn &apos;t even be talking to you .
this is not ok .
then send me away .
i &apos;m only here because you want to be with me
as much as i want to be with you .
send me away , jeremy .
it &apos;s that easy .
i don &apos;t know why this is happening
or when it &apos;s going to stop .
but before it &apos;s done ...
i have to do this .
ready ?
do you need me to do ...
right . ok .
i &apos;ll grab jeremy .
i &apos;ll be right back .
you know , i &apos;ve had enough vampires today , thanks .
oh , come on . have a drink with me . we &apos;ve got trouble .
no , you &apos;ve got trouble . see , we &apos;re not a team .
you tried to kill me . all right ? we &apos;re not friends .
i don &apos;t like you anymore .
but remember back when you liked me
and we conspired to kill uncle werewolf mason lockwood ?
yeah , and ?
i think he &apos;s still a little pissed .
bonnie , i don &apos;t like this .
bonnie ...
oh , my god . is that your ...
grams .
anna ?
lexi .
mason !
god , i miss whisky .
told ya .
you &apos;re dead .
well , technically , so are you .
then how the hell can i see--
see me ? yeah , i have no idea .
and i have no idea how long it &apos;s going to last ,
so let &apos;s get right to the point .
you &apos;re off the rails . big time .
look , i don &apos;t know how you &apos;re here ,
but you need to leave me alone , ok ?
now what kind of a friend would i be
if i didn &apos;t help you out of this mess you &apos;re in ?
i don &apos;t want your help .
you know , you say that every time .
&quot; i don &apos;t want your help ,
i don &apos;t want to get better , leave me alone . &quot;
well , maybe you should listen this time .
or maybe i should do this .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re here !
now stop your crying , we don &apos;t have time for tears .
nice to see you again , caroline .
hi , miss sheila .
a fine mess you &apos;ve made , honey .
the witches told you
there &apos;d be consequences to bringing jeremy back
and you did it anyway .
i didn &apos;t have a choice .
i love him and i-- i couldn &apos;t just let him go .
i understand .
but you cracked open the door to the other side .
there &apos;s an old witch over here . she took advantage of it .
she took advantage of you , honey .
when you did that spell to send vicki donovan away ,
she wedged the door wide open .
giving a free pass to anybody with unfinished business .
how do you know this ?
witches talk . even on the other side .
who do you think makes all the rules ?
what does the witch want ?
that &apos;s original vampire business , not yours .
i don &apos;t want you getting in the middle of that .
i &apos;m here .
because you upset the balance of nature .
and it &apos;s your duty to set it right .
you need to close that door .
how do we do that ?
apparently the old witch
can draw power from this side because of her talisman .
talisman ...
my necklace ?
it &apos;s some ju ju power source .
and i know you &apos;re not going to like this ,
but bonnie needs to destroy it .
i just walked in on jeremy kissing the reason .
i &apos;m completely ok with that .
what ? ! are you kidding ?
i wish . look , i don &apos;t have the necklace .
damon has it somewhere .
text him . i &apos;ll call you right back .
elena ...
you need to disappear
or evaporate
or whatever it is that you ghosts do .
hey , it &apos;s not her fault .
you &apos;re right , it &apos;s yours .
how did this happen ?
i don &apos;t know . ok ? i don &apos;t know .
it just--it did .
elena , please .
you can &apos;t tell bonnie .
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m going to let you do that .
right after i help her send the ghosts away .
looks like today was a good day to be thinking about me , elena .
lexi ?
come with me .
where ?
ripper detox 101 . crash course .
i--
i &apos;m sorry , did you not just say how desperate you were
for my help in saving stefan &apos;s life ?
let &apos;s go .
i am never going to hear the end of that damn necklace .
one of you will pay for this , right ?
cheers .
let &apos;s get to it . i killed you .
you want revenge . get in line .
actually , i want an apology .
good luck with that .
don &apos;t you have a family to haunt ?
you know your nephew has turned into a mindless hybrid minion .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m here . to help tyler .
well , sorry to break it to you , buddy ,
but tyler can &apos;t be helped .
at least not while klaus is alive .
which is , like , always .
not necessarily .
not if you found a weapon that could kill him .
there is no weapon that--
what do you know ?
i know you need to apologize .
you got to be kidding me .
are you incapable of remorse ? just apologize !
you &apos;re right .
i didn &apos;t have to kill you .
i do a lot of things i don &apos;t have to do .
that &apos;s good enough .
meet me at the old lockwood cellar .
bring a shovel .
and come alone .
what , you &apos;re going to bury me alive ?
don &apos;t tempt me .
klaus really did a number on him , huh ?
he compelled him to turn off his humanity .
well , we &apos;re just going to
have to convince him to turn it back on .
i have to warn you , it &apos;s not going to be pretty .
i can handle it .
wake up , sleepyhead .
how you feelin &apos; ?
what is this ?
let me out of here !
shh .
inside voices , please .
i &apos;m trying to get inside your head .
elena .
get rid of her , please .
no .
first step , drying him out .
starve away the blood lust .
strip away the temptation .
this isn &apos;t going to work , lexi .
you can &apos;t do this .
you heard the not pretty part ?
i heard you .
what are you doing ?
what are you doing , lexi ? !
doing what i do best , sweetness .
i &apos;m saving your life .
i &apos;m surprised you showed .
you put a snag in my only other klaus lead .
so i &apos;d say i &apos;m highly motivated .
michael ?
yeah . that didn &apos;t turn out so great , did it ?
how do you know so much ?
there &apos;s not much to do on the other side
but sit around and watch other people screw things up .
what are we looking for ?
there &apos;s an old lockwood family legend
about a weapon that can kill an original vampire .
like the rest of their secrets ,
they kept it buried .
oh , come on , give me the thing .
move .
i got it .
go for it .
you first .
what , you think i &apos;m leading you into a trap ?
the thought crossed my mind .
i &apos;m starving . i &apos;m starving .
i &apos;m starving ! let me out !
let me out . please let me out .
what &apos;s happening ?
he &apos;s hallucinating .
that &apos;s three months without any blood .
let me out !
now he &apos;s at nine months .
two years ...
five .
did i ever tell you how glad i am that you &apos;re dead ?
oh . i missed you , too , friend .
hello ?
so the necklace isn &apos;t where damon said it would be
and now we can &apos;t reach damon .
listen , i need you to get bonnie to hold off
on sending the ghosts back .
what ? !
but you said you were in full support of getting rid of them .
i was .
i am . look ,
lexi &apos;s here and she &apos;s helping with stefan .
ok , let &apos;s just find it first
and then we &apos;ll choose between boyfriend ghost dramas .
what are you talking about ?
um ... lexi &apos;s back ,
so elena wants us to hold off on destroying the necklace .
you said boyfriend dramas . plural .
what is it , caroline ?
elena caught jeremy kissing anna .
what ?
i &apos;m sorry .
he kissed her ?
she &apos;s got a foothold now ,
so she probably thinks that she &apos;s here to stay .
but you and i , bonnie , we &apos;re going to find that necklace .
ok ?
ok .
anna !
anna .
sorry .
anna !
hey , man , sorry about that .
no problem , buddy .
have you seen tobias fell ?
he &apos;s supposed to do the lighting ceremony .
no .
well , well .
frederick ?
if it isn &apos;t pearl &apos;s daughter .
little annabelle .
good evening , ladies and gentlemen .
mr. fell seems to have been detained ,
so the history department &apos;s very own mr. saltzman
has agreed to fill in .
anna !
still hanging around the gilbert kid , huh ?
i guess you forgot the fact
that his family killed you and your mother .
there you are .
is everything all right ?
ask your ancestors .
what are you doing here , frederick ?
well , it &apos;s a founder &apos;s celebration .
and we ...
we got some unfinished business
with the founding families .
on behalf of mystic falls high school historical society ,
let &apos;s light &apos; em up .
elena , elena .
i &apos;m hurting . please help me .
don &apos;t listen . shut him out .
i am helping you , stefan .
i &apos;ll do anything . i &apos;ll change . i promise .
it &apos;s a lie . he &apos;ll say anything right now .
elena , i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry . just make it stop .
please , just make it stop .
you have to separate yourself from your emotions .
don &apos;t let him play with them .
hey , look at me . look at me .
elena . i love you , ok ?
i love you .
i love you so much .
i love you so much , elena .
i &apos;m sorry , stefan , i just don &apos;t believe you .
you know what ?
i don &apos;t want your help , anyway .
i wish i &apos;d never met you .
every single moment that i &apos;ve spent with you
has been a complete and total waste .
you see that ? that &apos;s the ripper talking .
once he &apos;s weak enough , you have to cause him pain .
make him feel things .
anger , rage , anything .
you have to make him see past the blood .
think of it as a regimen .
day in and day out . like running the treadmill .
like making coffee .
until he &apos;s ready to be saved .
i will rip you apart , lexi !
you can &apos;t . i &apos;m already dead .
i can &apos;t ...
ugh ! i give up .
it &apos;s not anywhere in this room .
what do you want , jeremy ?
caroline ?
did you find that necklace ?
not yet . wait , what &apos;s going on ?
ghosts of the tomb vampires killed tobias fell .
you might want to find that necklace
before they start going
alphabetically through the founding families .
well , it &apos;s not where it &apos;s supposed to be .
unless someone took it .
who ?
well , who do you think ?
i didn &apos;t .
she said she didn &apos;t take it .
oh , and you believe her .
i didn &apos;t take it , jeremy .
you know what , yeah , yeah , i do believe her .
you know what , you &apos;re an even bigger idiot than i thought .
so wake up , jeremy , before you lose everything .
jeremy ?
what happened ?
i &apos;m still waiting for the other shoe to drop .
your motives are deceptively pure .
you talk the talk , but i know
you &apos;ll do anything for your brother .
you won &apos;t screw me over
as long as we have the same agenda .
i &apos;m supposed to believe you &apos;re not going to screw me over ?
all right . which way ?
i don &apos;t know . flip a coin .
aren &apos;t you supposed to be all @-@ knowing ?
i &apos;m a ghost . i &apos;m not god .
go left .
or not .
you have trust issues . anyone ever tell you that ?
help a brother out ?
mason ?
where is anna now ?
i don &apos;t know , ok ? i don &apos;t even know for sure
if she took the necklace .
she was the only person who heard us talking about it .
of course she took it . ok ?
we have to get it back .
we have to destroy it and then close the door .
i know , but ...
but what ?
what , jer ?
i can touch her , elena .
i can kiss her again .
and i know it &apos;s wrong ,
and i know that i shouldn &apos;t feel this way ,
but i do .
i love her .
i &apos;ve always loved her .
but it &apos;s not real .
she &apos;s dead . gone .
everything that you &apos;re hold on to is in the past , jer .
are you going to love a ghost
for the rest of your life ?
he &apos;s at the beginning of his life , anna .
you &apos;re just holding him back .
you know that .
call bonnie .
tell her that you have the necklace .
get her to send the ghosts away .
bad day .
sorry . thought you might need this .
you &apos;re welcome .
what &apos;s your game , man ?
i killed you .
i jammed my fist into your chest .
i ripped your heart out .
there &apos;s no way this whole buddy @-@ trust act is real .
you know what the other side is like ?
we &apos;re all alone .
we watch the people we left behind
and we regret our decisions .
that &apos;s it .
look , i can &apos;t change what happened to me .
but maybe i can change what happens to tyler .
i don &apos;t need revenge , damon .
i need redemption .
ok .
jeremy &apos;s got the necklace .
he &apos;s going to meet us at the witch house .
ok . what &apos;s going on up there ?
it &apos;s mrs. lockwood &apos;s car .
bonnie ?
i &apos;m going to get out of the car .
what ? !
and you &apos;re going to drive the hell away from here .
no way ! i am not leaving you !
bonnie , you &apos;ve got your ghost boyfriend drama .
elena has hers . and right now the mother of mine
is about to be ghost bait .
so go and send them all back to the other side , ok ?
this spell is just going to break your foothold , right ?
you &apos;ll still be here , i &apos;ll still be able to see you .
this--this doesn &apos;t have to be good @-@ bye .
no . but it should be .
elena was right . i &apos;m holding you back .
anna ...
i &apos;m sorry i took the necklace .
i just thought ,
with all the tomb vampires out , that maybe ...
you might find your mother .
i don &apos;t know where she is , jeremy .
i don &apos;t know if she &apos;s moved on
and found peace ,
or if there &apos;s even any peace to be found .
hey , there is , anna .
ok , there has to be .
i believe that , ok ?
i just ...
i don &apos;t want to be alone anymore .
look at me .
you &apos;re not going to be alone .
i &apos;m not going to let you be alone .
quit fighting me , stefan .
i know you &apos;re in there .
not anymore , lexi .
you know you say that every time .
until i make you feel again .
you wasted your whole life taking care of me .
now you &apos;re dead and you still have nothing better to do .
we &apos;re running out of time .
you &apos;ve got to get me more .
i can &apos;t .
no ! no--not until i break through .
i can &apos;t , lexi . they have a necklace .
they &apos;re going to close the door .
the necklace .
ok .
that necklace .
at least tell me you remember how you felt about that .
you found it during your darkest time .
and you said , when you made it through ,
that that necklace represented hope .
ironic , then , that it &apos;s about to be blown to pieces .
god ! this is not happening .
what now ?
i can &apos;t get through .
it &apos;s like i &apos;m not invited in . wait .
i &apos;m not stopping just &apos; cause you &apos;re stuck .
i &apos;ll let you know what i find .
yeah , but--
looks like you &apos;re going to have to trust me .
bonnie !
so ?
what &apos;d you find ?
it &apos;s in ...
no , no , no , no .
no , where &apos;d you go ?
mason , mason !
he &apos;s still in there , elena .
you just have to break through .
it &apos;s ok , lexi , i know what to do now .
you can be free .
mama ?
you are stronger than all of this .
i &apos;m so proud of you .
you &apos;re here . it &apos;s about time .
didn &apos;t have anyone else to call ?
no , actually , i don &apos;t .
&apos;cause i need a non @-@ vampire to get in the cave ,
and other than elena , you &apos;re pretty much the only one i trust .
well , you have a crappy way of showing that .
look , if mason lockwood can get over the fact that i killed him ,
can &apos;t you cut me a little slack , ric ?
i shouldn &apos;t have to get over it .
i was your friend , damon .
you shouldn &apos;t have done it in the first place .
well ! sometimes ...
i do things i don &apos;t have to do .
you &apos;re going to recycle that
same crap ass apology you gave mason lockwood ?
yeah . well ...
i didn &apos;t mean it with him .
so what are you going to do , elena ?
you just going to stand there ?
waiting for me to dry out ?
no , i &apos;m going to go home ,
take care of my brother . be a friend to bonnie
and everything else that i have to do .
that &apos;s good for you .
you know , i was wondering when you were going to give up .
lexi gave you enough of a
glimpse into your tragic future .
i haven &apos;t given up , stefan . i still have hope .
but there &apos;s nothing that i can do
until you get yours back .
you can break through this .
fight for it .
feel something . anything , stefan .
because if you don &apos;t ,
you &apos;re going to lose me forever .
i won &apos;t love a ghost for the rest of my life .
bonnie ...
just go away , jeremy .
i owe you an explanation .
matt let go of a sister before you let go of anna .
his sister , jeremy .
you know what you owe me ?
the respect of not making me listen to you explain yourself .
i am sorry , bonnie .
you need to go .
but--
just go , jeremy .
so was mason screwing with me , or is there something in there ?
ric .
i found something .
what is it ?
i have no idea .
