i am the system .
i consume humanity .

jeff winger !
* loser at law *
* rented office in a mini mall *
relax , tango . i come in peace .
way i see it , i screwed you .
i got screwed back .
now we can bygone the bygones ,
because i got a juicy new client and a bone to throw you .
you hear about that bridge that collapsed upstate ?
a human could &apos;ve said that without salivating .
i represent marvin humphries , the engineer who designed it .
he wants to seek damages .
from what ? his own pencil ?
from the only school reckless enough
to give him a degree in engineering .
city @-@ funded school ,
deep government pockets .
maybe you &apos;ve heard of it .
greendale community college .
weird choice , by the way ,
the bachelor &apos;s degree on the wall .
so you &apos;re gonna sue my old school
and you &apos;re bothering to tell me ?
you have access there .
i need marvin &apos;s records to prove
that he was irresponsibly educated .
well , why don &apos;t you just subpoena ?
right , so they can have a shredding party .
see , that &apos;s the difference between you and greendale , alan .
they wouldn &apos;t shred evidence .
it &apos;s a good place for good people .
it &apos;s a diploma mill .
it turns idiots into bridge @-@ collapsers .
and jeff winger into an attorney
that thought he could help people ?
jeff , i once saw you convince an arson victim
that he liked his house better burned .
god , look what that school did to you .
it took all your money . it took four years of your life .
and worst of all ,
it took your winger moves .
i still got my winger moves .
prove it . get me humphries &apos; records .
because the next bone you get thrown
might be through a dude &apos;s zipper in the warehouse district ,
and i can &apos;t guarantee you it &apos;ll be from me .
look , i might be broke , desperate , and nearly homeless ,
but i still got one thing deep down inside
that gives me power ... that was it .
that was all i had .
welcome back , human beings .
dean pelton here , wishing you another magic year at greendale ,
ranked america &apos;s number two community college
by greendalecommunitycollege.com.
regarding the recent tragedy surrounding
a certain collapsed bridge ,
we will be observing a moment of silence on the quad
followed by four years of silence to the press .
i told you you &apos;d be back .
shut up , leonard . i &apos;m not here .
i &apos;m just a figment of your creeping dementia .
how would i go about getting records for certain alumni ?
why would you think a stranger
could just walk in here and do that ?
you &apos;re , uh , rita .
rhonda .
i &apos;ve always regretted not telling you
how much you remind me of my aunt .
it &apos;s more disarming than it sounds .
i have a very attractive aunt .
rhonda , why are you wearing jeff winger &apos;s ...
jeffrey .
are you , uh , looking for your friends ?
they don &apos;t go here anymore .
maybe you &apos;re looking for something
that was in front of you the whole time , just a pitch .
he &apos;s asking for records for a certain alumni .
in the midst of all this marvin humphries business ,
i doubt this is a coincidence .
you &apos;re here to save me , aren &apos;t you ?
yes .
i thought i might contact alumni to form a committee :
the save greendale committee .
working title .
jeffrey , i &apos;m gonna cry .
please don &apos;t .
request denied .
rhonda will let you in the records room .
it &apos;s actually your old study room .
after you and your friends left ,
it was closed for sentimental reasons .
and asbestos reasons , but it &apos;s clean as a whistle now .
&quot; harassment reports , &quot;
&quot; hazardous waste citations , &quot;
&quot; herpes comma water fountains . &quot;
管理档案
come on . where &apos;s humphries ?
i see your value now .
abed , why ?
&quot; i see your value now . &quot;
it &apos;s a callback to when we met first season .
and me calling years &quot; seasons &quot; is a callback
to my first season dialogue , and me calling ...
abed , i know what makes you off @-@ putting ,
but why are you here ?
the dean called me about the save greendale committee .
can i join ?
well , i ...
oh , no . who else did he call ?
just me . i called everyone else .
jeffery !
jeff !
is that cool ?
it &apos;s the coolest .
jeff , if you wanted to save greendale ,
why didn &apos;t you call us first ?
well , you guys just got sprung from this joint ,
and i figured you had careers to get started .
yeah , working hard .
ah , yes .
what have they done to our home ?
the table &apos;s buried .
i got it .
this is where we became a family .
jeff made us a family .
we could repilot it .
this could be like scrubs season nine ,
a revamp , a do @-@ over .
jeff could come back to greendale as a teacher .
i &apos;m not gonna be a teacher , abed .
that &apos;s lame .
come on .
sit in your chair .
complete the table .
we want to help you save greendale .
yeah !
greendale ! greendale !
greendale !
i got to go to the bathroom .
mm , give him space .
repiloting can be intense .
new people show up .
regulars shift roles or even fall away .
season nine of scrubs ,
zach braff was only in the first six episodes .
that son of a bitch .
after everything scrubs did for him ?
i &apos;m sorry .
vision boarding .
okay , vision boarding ! oh , hi , jeffrey .
dean , i have to warn you about something ,
because it &apos;s the right thing to do .
but first , why is there a big empty box on your desk .
that says &quot; humphries &quot; on it ?
okay , the press has been calling about humphries ,
and i didn &apos;t want any details about his enrollment here
to be spun against us ,
so now there are no details .
that was his thesis .
okay ! so sue me !
this ain &apos;t harvard , jeffrey .
okay , my job is to give
a certain number of degrees per year ,
or we could get shut down .
and that would be bad because ...
ah , because then i wouldn &apos;t have a job .
and , you know , greendale is a good place for good people .
that whole spiel , huh ?
yeah .
that whole spiel .
wingblade . shock me by impressing me .
he shredded humphries .
what ?
i told you ! how could you let this happen ?
sir , i have to ask you to leave the concierge desk .
jeff , this case was all i had .
i am screwed !
my wife left . my girlfriend dumped me .
and they &apos;re sisters , so now the whole family &apos;s pissed .
shut up .
bring me all the paperwork for filing a class action :
letters of intent , engagement , everything .
multiple copies .
winger , you just lost our client !
yeah .
but i can create five new ones .
it &apos;s so dusty . let &apos;s get this off the table .
and that &apos;s the winger guarantee .
okay , maybe we should bring a fund raising ideas
that aren &apos;t bake sales .....
or opening a zoo where the humans are in cages
and the animals come to visit .
are you okay , jeff ? you left kind of freaked out .
well ...
i can &apos;t stop thinking this school might be in trouble
because of this bridge @-@ collapsing guy .
he &apos;s the one making bad bridges .
that &apos;s like me blaming owls for how much i suck at analogies .
sometimes a student will claim , in court ,
that their school ruined their life ,
and they &apos;ll win .
you want to save greendale ?
make it litigation @-@ proof .
how ?
think like the enemy .
how did greendale damage you , annie ?
it didn &apos;t . i love hospital administration .
is that your job ?
well ... not yet .
but i administer things to hospitals ,
like these .
pen ?
&quot; futurza &quot; ?
they &apos;re a rising star in pharmaceuticals .
they invented fibromyalgia
and the cure for fibromyalgia .
you push drugs now ? that &apos;s ironic .
i push pens , britta .
speaking of irony , how &apos;s the therapy market ?
depressed ?
i &apos;m on sabbatical .
you &apos;re jewish ?
i &apos;m doing hands @-@ on research about the psychology of alcoholism .
you &apos;re a bartender , aren &apos;t you ?
which is basically like a modern @-@ day therapist .
if somebody tells me about a murder ,
i can &apos;t tell anyone .
wow , you &apos;re even bad at bartending .
what about you ?
abed &apos;s working on the next
billion @-@ dollar social media app .
and when it takes off , all i got to do is sue him .
it &apos;s fool @-@ proof .
you &apos;re programming now , abed ?
didn &apos;t get any work with your four @-@ year film degree ?
one job , directing a commercial .
still haven &apos;t been paid .
i &apos;ll cut you a check tomorrow ,
but just so we &apos;re clear , you quit .
creative differences .
i asked you to put the phone number on the screen .
i didn &apos;t like the number .
555 ? it &apos;s derivative .
it &apos;s the number of my business .
it sounds fake .
how can every number start with 555 ?
are there only 10,000 numbers ?
abed , you quit ?
you said you got fired .
you haven &apos;t paid in our apartment for two months .
well , why don &apos;t you sell him a pill
that will help him give up on his dreams ?
relaxabrex doesn &apos;t make you give up on your dreams .
that &apos;s a side effect .
at least the drugs i sell don &apos;t get slurped
out of my belly button .
that &apos;s only on tummy tuesdays !
oh , it &apos;s okay ...
oh , i &apos;m sorry ...
andre left again .
it &apos;s ... it &apos;s not like last time .
he &apos;s staying with family .
he took the boys .
he took the dog .
he took the d.v.r.
166 episodes of bones just gone .
it was my fault this time .
i cheated on him
with shirley &apos;s sandwiches .
i threw the money into expanding .
i just didn &apos;t think i could fail .
okay .
well , just so you know ,
this is the sort of stuff that someone could use
to make a claim against a school .
i have to go to the bathroom again .
while i &apos;m gone ,
i want you to think about what i said .
as an exercise .
do you guys feel weird about doing this without ...
magnitude ?
that &apos;s everything you asked for .
who are you flipping ?
my friends ,
who are now the save greendale committee ,
which i created .
classic winger .
i forgot what it was like to be good at being bad .
so just close the deal and bring it home to daddy , eh ?
oh , sorry , alan . change of daddies .
i &apos;ll take it from here .
no , no , but it &apos;s my case .
humphries was your case .
jeff ...
you &apos;re scaring me .
good .
guys like you should be more scared .
you trust @-@ funded , body @-@ sprayed ,
eli @-@ roth @-@ dvd owner ...
you &apos;re an amateur monster , alan ,
and you stomp in the grave of a real monster
who was willing to stay buried ,
because real monsters have shame ,
because they wish that ...
you &apos;re not worth the monologue .
give me your tie .
what ?
no monologue for you . give me your tie .
that &apos;s for making me go to this school .
that &apos;s for making the last four years happen .
and now i get to make them un @-@ happen
for me and the only people i care about .
i failed my husband . i failed my kids .
i &apos;ve failed bones .
i &apos;m helping to hook a whole new battle
of little annies on adderall .
i &apos;ve been spending so much time with computers ,
your tears are just ones and zeroes to me .
yeah , you were a real hallmark card before .
i &apos;m much sadder than the rest of you .
i will figure out why later .
jeff , full disclosure :
our lives are worse than the day we got here .
well , that is a serious allegation
to arrive at all by yourselves .
are you sure ?
yes .
and we &apos;ve come to a decision as a group ,
and please don &apos;t judge us for suggesting it .
hey , i &apos;ll back you up no matter what .
we decided to re @-@ enroll at greendale .
what ? are you nuts ?
greendale ! greendale !
greendale ! greendale !
you guys want to keep it down ?
chang ?
kevin ?
chang . i &apos;ve dropped the amnesia thing ,
copped to my crimes , and went to jail .
now i &apos;m on work release .
working as what ?
math teacher .
next , explain the pajamas .
well , i &apos;m on work release from house arrest ,
but i don &apos;t have a home .
see this ?
this won &apos;t let me travel 100 yards from this ,
and this only has a 30 @-@ yard cord ,
so i can only travel ...
whatever . you do the math .
you said you teach math .
exactly ; i teach it . you do it .
chang was faking his changnesia ?
they seriously rehired a teacher
they fired for trying to burn down the school ?
after being rehired as a security guard
after being fired for impersonating a teacher .
that &apos;s insane , and i &apos;m abed .
worse than insane . irresponsible .
evil .
i don &apos;t believe in evil .
but this school clearly got a finger up its butt as a child .
this place ruins lives .
if that were true ,
then what could we possibly do about it ?
make &apos; em dance , winger .
ew , jeff , what &apos;s your evil old legal nemesis doing here ?
nemesis ?
no , we were partners again .
until i lost my usefulness .
i may be evil ,
but your friend here is so much more dangerous .
tell &apos; em how it took you 30 minutes
to make them think they wanted to sue their own school .
i did it .
sorry .
anyway , i &apos;ll leave you to pick up these pieces .
i &apos;m gonna go score some blow .
my dealer &apos;s a gym teacher here .
you lied to us ?
i never lied to you .
i showed you the right truth .
britta , when we met ,
you were an eclectic anarchist .
how did you become the group &apos;s airhead ?
thank you ?
and , shirley , you &apos;ve gone from an independent divorcee
striking out on her own
to a bankrupt fry cook hoping for a call from her husband .
troy , your entire identity has been consumed
by your relationship with another man .
you found my clive own tumblr .
and what happened to annie the unstoppable go @-@ getter ?
well , there was that gas leak last year .
oh , don &apos;t blame it all on the gas leak year .
this was a four @-@ year process .
we went in one end as real people
and out the other end as mixed @-@ up cartoons .
cool .
sure .
this coming from the guy who &apos;s had
how many psychotic breaks on campus ?
are we including the gas leak year ?
you all came here with a chance to be something ,
and you all had that taken away from you .
get something back .
seek damages .
sign here .
but you &apos;re our hero .
i mean , in the commercial .
the commercial was a lie .
you staged a robot fight ?
yeah .
in real life , the robot wins .
troy ?
if jeff didn &apos;t change , then jeff is right .
case closed . let &apos;s make some money .
okay , jeff , if this is what you really want to do .
i &apos;ll sign .
the choice to make is yours .
no , it &apos;s yours .
we &apos;re putting greendale in your hands .
do we all have to say something ?
no , you can just sign it .
okay .
you brought us together .
with lies .
but what you do is above lying , remember ?
you show us the right truth .
you won &apos;t regret this .
i &apos;d like to take the study room table in back and burn it .
burn it ? why ?
the same reason i never returned time bandits to blockbuster .
blockbuster为知名dvd租赁公司 已破产
nobody else deserves it .
jesus !
looks as if you &apos;ve lost your way .
pierce ?
continue on this path , and you might miss your last chance
to see the pierce hawthorne museum of gender sensitivity
and sexual potency on the central quad .
the museum and this hologram were donated in compliance
with a court order i &apos;m not allowed to discuss .
let &apos;s just say some women can &apos;t take a compliment .
unbelievable .
what i am allowed to discuss is greendale ,
and i &apos;ll say this :
don &apos;t turn your back on it .
take it from a man with no legal right to be there .
you &apos;re in a special place .
a crappy place , sure ,
but only because it gives crappy people a chance
to sort themselves out .
did i sound gay at the end ?
do you want to do another take ?
jeffrey , i &apos;m not decent .
i know .
these are the signatures of the five people
that are crazy enough to care about this toilet .
and tonight , i almost got them to sue it .
heed the warning !
it &apos;s not easy being dean , jeffrey !
then stop being the dean !
it &apos;s my whole ideantity !
i mean , wah , see what i did there ? that &apos;s proof !
get your crap together .
your job is not to hand out degrees .
your job is to make this a toilet
that people don &apos;t have to be crazy to care about .
but you could stay here and help me save the school .
for how much money ?
i @-@ i can &apos;t offer you any money .
i could offer you a job .
you just described slavery .
i mean , there &apos;s nothing in the budget for school saver ,
but i could hire you as ...
screw you , abed .
i &apos;d be depressed right now if these samples from work
weren &apos;t giving me a new outlook on life .
if you &apos;re interested in learning more ,
ask your doctor if joyvatrex is right for you .
oh , honey .
if we sue greendale , can i be a surprise witness ?
wait . don &apos;t tell me .
stop !
we shouldn &apos;t sue the school .
ohh . come on !
are you trying to give us emotional whiplash ?
look , if you feel there &apos;s more work to be done on yourselves ,
then as crappy as this place is ,
it &apos;s a place that you can do it .
you got a job teaching here , didn &apos;t you ?
i don &apos;t want to talk about it .
well , then , i &apos;m getting back into forensic science .
that was my actual dream . it &apos;s my fault i bailed on it .
a film degree doesn &apos;t make me a filmmaker .
i need to learn how to work with other people .
i need to figure out who i am .
i &apos;ll help you .
get out of my brain .
i need to learn how to really run a business
by my own standards , not greendale &apos;s .
i &apos;m gonna get a four @-@ year psych degree ,
then a master &apos;s , and become a real psychologist .
or you could find another major .
a real psychologist .
how about english ?
psychology .
all right , what &apos;s important is ,
no matter what ,
we &apos;ll be trying to talk britta into doing something different
together .
burn , hopelessness .
it &apos;s a fire ...
little victories count for a lot around here ...
even if you never asked to win in the first place .
and you have to enjoy those nice moments while you can .
see , he does a voice @-@ over wrap @-@ up at the end of every episode .
wow .
cool .
because around here , they never last very long .
once more . more teachery .
i want to kill myself .
use that .
are you a good person ?
yes , unlike you .
i can guarantee ...
the winger beaten you ...
not any more .
another all new episode of community is coming up next .
here on nbc .
