five years ago ,
susan delfino gave birth to a son in
delivery room &quot; a &quot; of fairview memorial hospital .
moments later , lila dash gave birth to a daughter in delivery room &quot; b . &quot;
around 10 : 00 the next morning ,
as the two new mothers were leaving the hospital ,
they nearly ran into each other .
of course , they never knew this .
in fact ,
susan and lila would have been surprised to know
how often their paths would cross over the years .
they almost met at the local coffee shop ...
and another time at their veterinarian &apos;s office ...
and again in the bleachers of the fairview flyers .
but despite these close calls , susan and lila never met ...
until one tuesday ,
when susan decided to take her husband to
a fancy restaurant for their anniversary ...
at the same time ,
lila decided to take her daughter to buy some ice cream .
that was the night that susan delfino
and lila dash finally ran into each other .
mike !
it will happen to all of us eventually .
the moment will come when we ask ourselves ...
where did the time go ?
how did the children i once cradled ...
grow up so very quickly ?
how did the life i dreamt of ...
turn into a career i never expected ?
and how did that woman i saw each day in the mirror ...
become someone i don &apos;t even recognize ?
juanita , this dress is awfully tight .
i don &apos;t think you can get into it .
no , it &apos;s pretty . i can do it .
how &apos;s that one fit ? oh , i think we &apos;re gonna need the next size up .
uh , there is no next size up .
they don &apos;t make princess dresses for girls over 7 .
she &apos;s only 4.1 / 2 .
look , my daughter was invited to a princess party ,
so i can &apos;t let her be the only girl there without a princess dress .
did you try the costume section ?
i bet they &apos;d have a mrs. shrek dress that would fit her .
juanita , take off the dress ! we &apos;re going .
no ! i can do it .
look , i feel for you .
my niece also has a weight problem .
my daughter does not have a weight problem .
she has a little baby fat , that &apos;s all .
in fact ,
the only problem she has is this store being
completely unprepared for a perfectly average 4 @-@ year @-@ old girl .
just ring it up .
no , no , no !
oh , for god sakes. what &apos;s wrong now ?
once again , the concept is , sweetie ,
you &apos;re taking the pie out of the oven ,
your face aglow with surprise .
why am i surprised ? because it turned out so perfectly .
well , that &apos;s no surprise. my pies are always perfect .
all right. it &apos;s your best pie ever .
you &apos;ve topped yourself. hmm ?
mm. and i know this before i &apos;ve tasted it ?
sweetie , just make whatever face you want .
i just think you &apos;ll sell more cookbooks if you
don &apos;t look like you just made love to an ice cube .
andrew , dear , i &apos;m going to take a little break .
would you please tell this gentleman that if he calls me &quot; sweetie &quot;
one more time , i &apos;m gonna grab his camera and take a picture of his colon ?
you got that , right ?
katherine , hi .
what are you doing here ?
the waiters need to be paid , and you took the key to the cashbox ... again .
oh. sorry. paid for what ? the armenian wedding ? lunch for 300 ?
it was right after the breakfast for the garden club ,
which you also missed. look , i &apos;m sorry .
i didn &apos;t know a photo shoot would take this long .
i mean , who knew it &apos;d be this hard to pose for a book cover ?
oh , you &apos;ll be fine .
if there &apos;s one thing you &apos;re really good at , it &apos;s posing as a chef .
okay , katherine .
i know this book has been monopolizing my time ,
and you feel overworked and undervalued .
but i do appreciate you. in fact , i have a gift for you .
it &apos;s the galleys of my new book .
read page 2 .
&quot; for katherine mayfair-- &quot; a wonderful cook and an even better friend . &quot;
you dedicated it to me ?
well , you make this all possible .
it &apos;s the least i could do .
ahem ! excuse me .
time is money. chop @-@ chop , sweetie .
andrew ... do we have a backup pie ?
yes. yes , we do .
good .
and the big blind ...
catches a jack on the river .
preston ?
mom !
what the hell &apos;s going on here ? don &apos;t freak out .
we &apos;re just playing cards. oh , yeah ? why didn &apos;t you play at home ?
why did you have to sneak in here ?
tequila shots ! 5 bucks !
asked and answered .
okay , that &apos;s it ! everybody out. game &apos;s over .
can i have your chair for a second ?
hey ! look up here ! mom &apos;s here. party &apos;s over .
door &apos;s open. out you go. go on. shoo !
you guys have pulled a lot of stupid stunts .
but this ?
this ?
risking our liquor license , our livelihood ?
who &apos;s going to find out ?
i mean , we &apos;ve been running this game for a month ,
and nobody-- unbelievable. you guys are grounded for two weeks .
but we have homecoming .
yeah , yeah ! keep complaining . i &apos;d love to make it a year .
now clean this place up. now !
wow. that was fantastic .
amazing .
whew. you were incredible .
so were you .
time to go .
susan ?
so it &apos;s been , what , four months ?
are you ever gonna let me spend the night ?
i don &apos;t know. come on , zippy , zippy .
okay. it &apos;s just , you know ...
girls usually beg me to spend the night .
well , good , then you shouldn &apos;t have any problem finding a place to sleep .
fine . i know the drill .
i can &apos;t spend the night . i can &apos;t meet your friends .
i can &apos;t meet your son .
i &apos;m just wondering-- is this ever gonna turn into something normal ?
you know , you &apos;re a guy , and we just had hot sex ,
and i didn &apos;t force you to cuddle .
so run ! go ! brag to your friends .
look ...
i like you , and i know you like me .
so why can &apos;t we be a couple ?
&apos;cause i &apos;m ... not ready for that .
and what we &apos;ve got-- that &apos;s all i can handle .
go .
okay , but that &apos;s only gonna work , like , 500 or 600 more times .
good evening. can i help you ?
wrong question. the question is , can i help you ?
look , if you &apos;re trying to sell me something , i don &apos;t have any money .
you do now .
i don &apos;t understand .
i &apos;m here to buy you out of your lease .
what ?
i know. it &apos;s sudden .
but there &apos;s something about this house that ...
well , it just feels like home to me .
so i &apos;d like to move in ... tonight .
tonight ? are you crazy ?
a little bit .
okay , here .
i will more than cover your moving expenses .
look , uh ... i @-@ i &apos;m all set up here .
besides , my landlady would never allow it .
why don &apos;t you let me worry about her ?
mm , no. i @-@ i don &apos;t have anywhere else to go .
i think you should leave .
look , raymond ...
how do you know my name ?
i made you a very generous offer ,
and i just know you &apos;re going to make the right decision .
five .
five what ? what are you talking about ?
four .
are you-- i don &apos;t understand .
three. o @-@ okay. hang on for a second .
two .
well , raymond , thank you very much .
here you go. take care .
all taken care of ... mrs. williams .
thank you ... mr. williams .
the next morning ,
edie britt decided to announce her return to wisteria lane in a way ...
that was guaranteed ...
to make a big splash .
okay , you &apos;re not gonna believe this , but ...
she &apos;s back .
edie ? is that really you ?
you know someone else my age with a body like this ?
so you &apos;re back ?
what happened to your tenant ?
he , uh , came into some money and decided to move .
we thought , what the heck ? let &apos;s move back !
&quot; we &quot; ?
oh , you don &apos;t know . i have a husband now .
really ? whose ?
so i &apos;m in vegas talking to this real estate convention .
i do a little motivational speaking .
and there-- sixth row , center aisle ,
is the most beautiful woman i have ever seen .
so after i finish , i walk into the audience
and i ask this goddess out .
his seminar was called &quot; getting what you want , &quot;
and he did ...
three times. hmm. before dinner .
well , it &apos;s certainly nice to meet you , dave ,
and let us be the first to welcome you to wisteria lane .
oh , you know what ? we should have a dinner or something .
oh , let &apos;s make it a party. we could do it at my restaurant .
we &apos;d be honored .
thank you .
so , gaby , i have to ask .
what the hell happened to you ? i mean , look at you .
your--your clothes , your--your hair .
carlos might be blind , but the rest of us aren &apos;t .
i had two children .
for what ? breakfast ?
edie ? on your first day back in the neighborhood ?
you &apos;re right .
i &apos;m sorry , gaby .
it was rude and insensitive , and it won &apos;t happen again .
really ?
okay .
now shouldn &apos;t we offer your friends something to eat ?
ooh ! i baked some muffins .
please don &apos;t take this the wrong way , but ...
we love you .
mijita ! lunch is ready. go get your sister .
carlos , what &apos;s with all the cheese ?
you know how juanita feels about brussels sprouts .
i &apos;m just trying to make vegetables more fun .
well , next time , give her a carrot and put her on a roller coaster .
have you tried to lift her lately ? i know she &apos;s gotten chubby .
she &apos;ll grow out of it .
ha ! we can only hope with your d.n.a. running through her veins .
hey , i do not have fat d.n.a.
oh , don &apos;t make me pull out the solis family photo album .
it &apos;s like a bunch of sea lions posing on a rock .
i &apos;m sorry my relatives don &apos;t measure up to
the group of stick @-@ thin drunks that you come from .
all i &apos;m saying is that our daughter has a weight problem ,
and the sooner we admit it , the better. she &apos;s only 4 .
but , you know , you want her to develop a weight problem ?
go ahead. nag , criticize , make her feel self @-@ conscious .
see what happens .
and obviously i am not getting through to the twins ,
because no matter what i say , they keep pulling this crap ,
and i am sick of it. honey , could you ...
sorry .
yeah. so you-- you want me to talk to them ?
you have to . i am tired of being the bad cop .
you walk the beat for a while. fine .
you know , boys this age ,
they &apos;re more likely to listen to their dads anyway .
i @-@ i can handle this .
i really appreciate it .
honey , you know what i &apos;d appreciate ? could you ...
sorry .
so kirby has aces in the hole ... yeah .
which means that bobby will have to wear a dress to school on monday .
oh ! oh , my ! okay .
you &apos;ve got to get a picture of that !
tom ? can i talk to you a sec ?
don &apos;t you think you were kind of sending the wrong message in there ?
i know we don &apos;t approve of what they did , but you--you gotta admit .
come on. starting their own casino is kind of creative .
yeah ? &quot; creative &quot; like selling fake i.d.s was creative .
and hot @-@ wiring mccluskey &apos;s car-- that was a work of art .
honey , honey , this is nothing like that .
i mean , look , the whole school is talking about their card game .
do you realize it was , like , the place to be on a monday night ?
oh , my god .
what ?
you think they &apos;re cool .
well ... yeah .
no , i mean you think they &apos;re cool in that you wanna be them .
oh , please .
you do !
this is tom , former high school nerd ,
living vicariously through his awesome @-@ ass kids .
hey , i was plenty cool in high school .
are we redefining &quot; cool &quot;
to include playing trombone in the marching band ?
you &apos;re overreacting .
they &apos;re a little high @-@ spirited , but i trust them .
so i &apos;ve decided to unground them for the homecoming dance .
but i told them they couldn &apos;t go .
and you told me to handle it , and i just did .
oh , by the way , it wasn &apos;t a trombone .
it was a tuba .
know your brass .
juanita !
you said i could have cake .
i know , but so much ?
you could &apos;ve gone back for a second piece .
this is my second piece .
and it &apos;s not juanita &apos;s fault .
in this kind of situation , i blame the parents .
look , my kid would eat sugar all day long if i let her .
gaby &apos;s obviously one of those moms who just can &apos;t say no .
it &apos;s a shame , too. juanita has such a pretty face .
i &apos;m back .
you want something cold ?
well , actually , i &apos;m in the mood for something hot .
you know ...
this is why it &apos;s taking four months to get my house painted .
haven &apos;t you ever heard that expression ,
&quot; you can have it done fast ,
or you can have it done right &quot; ?
i think i &apos;ll have it done right now .
hey , susan ?
mm. uh , lynette , it &apos;s not really a good time .
i just need five seconds to bitch about tom ,
and then i &apos;ll-- oh , my god .
your painter isn &apos;t done yet ?
yeah. he--he &apos;s hard to keep track of .
well , anyway ,
tom refuses to acknowledge that the
twins are turning into juvenile delinquents .
just the other day , i was-- oh , you poor thing ! you need a hug .
have you been drinking ?
sorry to have barged in ,
and thanks for letting me get that off my chest .
hey , anytime that you need to talk , you just ring my bell ...
and wait .
okay , new rule .
from now on , sex only happens in the bedroom , door closed ,
between the hours of 7 : 00 and 10 : 00 p.m. you know what ?
it &apos;d be a hell of a lot easier for me to follow the rules if
i knew why they existed . i just don &apos;t want my friends to know .
why ? you--you ashamed of me ?
no , of course not .
it &apos;s just ... complicated .
i &apos;m just a simple guy , so i can &apos;t be your dirty little secret .
i need more from you .
i &apos;m sorry . i can &apos;t give that to you .
honey , i know you wanna go home and watch your cartoons ,
but you had a lot of cake ,
so i was thinking i &apos;d take you to the park .
that way , you could run around and get some nice , fun exercise .
no .
you sure ?
running around in the sun and fresh air
would make you feel good .
mm ... no .
okay .
why don &apos;t you go throw that in the trash ?
and i &apos;m gonna get the car started .
hey , juanita .
you wanna play a new game on the way home ?
winner gets a new doll. okay .
well , come on , then !
mommy , what are you doing ?
it &apos;s a new game i invented , and you &apos;re winning 1 to nothing !
katherine ! fantastic news .
&quot; what &apos;s cookin &apos; fairview ? &quot;
is sending out a camera crew tomorrow
to do a piece on me and the book .
oh , which i just finished this morning .
you read it already ? yes . i couldn &apos;t put it down .
but i have to tell you ,
at least a dozen recipes are missing a pretty crucial ingredient .
really ?
what ?
my name .
excuse me ?
bree , your book is filled with recipes
hat we developed together ,
and--and some of them are flat @-@ out mine. oh , don &apos;t be silly .
i may have based a few on your recipes ,
but i always changed something .
like what ? the font ?
name one difference between this meatloaf recipe and mine .
well , yours calls for minced curly leaf parsley .
mine calls for minced flat leaf .
it &apos;s minced ! who can tell the difference ?
bree , you have recipes in here you can &apos;t even make .
never heard anything so absurd .
the croquembouche cake with the spun sugar netting ?
i &apos;ve never once seen you work with molten sugar .
i always make that cake. really , katherine .
just because i let you execute
a few eye @-@ catching garnishes that gratify
your need to show off ,
doesn &apos;t mean that i can &apos;t do them just as well myself .
you let me ?
i thought we were partners .
we are .
that &apos;s why your name is on the dedication page .
you were right about the dedication , bree .
it really was the least you could do .
18 to zero !
2 more points , and you &apos;ll break the record .
mommy , i &apos;m tired !
really ?
i thought running through that guy &apos;s sprinkler
would &apos;ve refreshed you .
now come on !
no .
looks like mommy &apos;s gonna score her first 2 points .
come on , juanita .
show mommy what a winner you are .
juanita !
what are you doing ? !
juanita , stop !
and while i thought
grounding you was an appropriate punishment ,
your dad convinced me i was being a little too hard on you guys .
absolutely .
and so we have decided to
let you go to the homecoming dance tonight ...
that &apos;s right !
in your father &apos;s convertible .
um , um , h @-@ h @-@ hold on. what ? wh-- come on , tom .
i mean , we trust them , right ?
yes , yes .
i @-@ i would trust them more if they were driving your car .
no !
you don &apos;t want two cool kids
pulling up to homecoming in a mom car ,
especially with that big dent they put in it last month .
here you go .
dude ! thanks ! thanks !
don &apos;t thank me. thank your father. thanks , dad !
you rock ! uh , you--whoa ! whoa ! whoa ! whoa ! whoa ! here--some ground rules .
n @-@ no muddy shoes on my floor mats. no-- tom , relax !
you high @-@ spirited kids do whatever it takes to have fun .
whoo ! i &apos;m driving it , man .
and in three , two , one .
welcome back to &quot; what &apos;s cookin &apos; fairview ? &quot;
we &apos;re talking with bree van de kamp , fairview &apos;s premier caterer ,
who &apos;s about to publish her very first cookbook .
bree , could you show us inside ?
this is my kitchen , and this is my staff-- the most gifted ,
hardworking team a cook could ever have hoped for .
i cannot say enough good things about them .
so which one of you has worked with bree the longest ?
that would be me .
so tell me , what &apos;s it really like working with bree ?
it &apos;s inspiring .
there is absolutely nothing she can &apos;t do .
katherine , i &apos;m blushing .
working with her has been ...
such an education that i--aah !
ah ! oh , god. are you all right ?
i think i strained my wrist. god , it hurts .
oh , you poor dear. could someone please get some ice ? oh , no .
and i was just about to put the spun
sugar netting on our famous croquembouche .
would you mind doing it ?
katherine , i &apos;m sure your wrist is just fine .
no , it &apos;s really throbbing .
okay , it looks like bree to the rescue .
be sure you get this .
really something to see .
the secret to spinning sugar is this
special whisk that makes lovely gossamer threads .
careful , dear .
you &apos;re clumping . i can see that .
that stuff &apos;s hot !
sorry .
so that &apos;s your idea of exercise ? having her run after a car ?
carlos , our daughter sucked down half a sheet cake , and afterwards ,
no one could find the candles .
wake up ! we have got a problem !
i just don &apos;t think the solution is to humiliate her .
now even if she &apos;s ...
heavy , doesn &apos;t she have the right to feel good about herself ?
hey , i &apos;m protecting her. she doesn &apos;t know the truth yet .
women only have five seconds to be young and beautiful ,
and then it &apos;s gone .
and then before you know it ,
we &apos;re old and fat and married
wondering where our beauty went .
gaby ...
no , carlos . i mean ...
sometimes i &apos;m glad you can &apos;t see me .
five years and two kids and no time for facials or the gym .
it just ... takes a toll .
and when edie saw me the other day ,
it was like she didn &apos;t even recognize me .
listen to me .
nobody knows your face better than i do .
and i see it every time i kiss you .
in 5 years or 50 , you will always be beautiful .
hear me ?
and now to finish ,
you simply transfer your spun sugar to the
croquembouche and gracefully
drape it around in a delicate swirl .
did i mention that you ...
probably shouldn &apos;t be wearing jewelry
while working with spun sugar ?
well , there &apos;s no law that says it has to be a delicate veil .
i mean , it could really just be
a beautiful , um , little , uh , white ...
ribbon .
turn off the damn camera .
ah , actually , my wrist is feeling a little better .
why don &apos;t i give it a shot ?
whatcha doing ?
okay , where are they ? it &apos;s 30 minutes past curfew .
actually , it &apos;s 32 .
if there is a single scratch on that car-- i mean ,
after all the time that i spent restoring that thing ...
yeah .
remember when you spent the entire day on
the internet trying to find a new gearshift knob ?
worst anniversary ever .
i cannot believe that you did this to me .
i know .
that car is your baby .
if only there was something i felt that intensely about .
oh , wait ! there is-- my actual babies .
you think i don &apos;t care about our boys ?
i know you love them ,
but sometimes you find them so cool and entertaining ,
you forget to parent them .
lynette-- no , listen .
this is important .
when they were little and they &apos;d act out ,
and we &apos;d always say , &quot; relax !
they &apos;re young .
when they &apos;re older , they &apos;ll get it . &quot;
well , tom , they &apos;re 16 now .
not getting it .
we have a lot of work to do in a very short time ,
and if you and i aren &apos;t in sync ,
i &apos;m afraid it &apos;s not gonna happen .
hey , sorry we &apos;re late. yeah. but ,
dad , you have to hear this story .
we just pulled up at an intersection ,
and there were these two hot girls-- i don &apos;t want to hear it .
you ever hear of a thing called a cell phone ?
we &apos;re only , like , 35 minutes late .
yeah , 35 minutes ,
during which time your mother and i have been worried sick .
but , dad-- you broke the rules. there are consequences .
you &apos;re both grounded for a month .
this sucks !
you &apos;re only doing this
&apos;cause you were worried about your precious car .
you think ? get out of the way .
any other opinions you &apos;d like to share ?
thank you .
but you didn &apos;t have to ...
that mirror was scratched .
i already ordered a new one .
mrs. mccluskey ! you &apos;re still alive !
oh , it &apos;s nice to see you , too , edie .
this is my husband , dave williams .
so how did you two meet ?
you run a free clinic or something ?
i &apos;m sorry. who are you ?
karen mccluskey , edie &apos;s best friend on the street .
well , it &apos;s a real pleasure to meet you .
what are you doing here ?
um , i just need to talk to you .
not here. go home . i &apos;ll call you .
when ?
i don &apos;t know. later. just go .
i have to say , ladies , this is quite a shindig .
oh , i &apos;m glad you &apos;re enjoying yourself .
yeah , i mean ,
there &apos;s really not a lot of people who go to
this much trouble to say they &apos;re sorry .
excuse me ?
well , the party. it &apos;s just a beautiful way to apologize .
edie , this is not a &quot; we &apos;re sorry &quot; party .
this is a &quot; we forgive you &quot; party .
you forgive me ?
well , i think what gaby means is
you were fairly awful to us right before you
left , and this is our way of welcoming you back
to hopefully not do it again .
you gotta be kidding .
you froze me out .
you threatened to ruin my business
and you ran me out of town .
now it &apos;s taken me five years to stop hating you .
great party , ladies .
thank you very much .
now ... mind if i steal my wife ?
sweetheart ?
isn &apos;t that your painter ?
is it ? i can &apos;t tell .
ooh ! excuse me. it &apos;s okay .
didn &apos;t they pay the bill ?
all right. calm down . i &apos;ll take care of it .
you , come with me .
why would you humiliate me in front of my friends ?
are you a lunatic ?
i @-@ i &apos;m just trying to get through to you .
and , yeah , it &apos;s making me kinda crazy .
susan ... why can &apos;t i meet your friends ?
i mean , am i really that horrible ?
no , of course not. my friends would love you .
then what is the problem ?
the problem is , if you meet my friends
then we &apos;re in a relationship ,
and i can &apos;t be in a relationship right now .
but i @-@ i promise , i &apos;ll make you very happy .
well , maybe i don &apos;t deserve to be happy .
a few years ago ...
there was this car accident ...
a bad one .
take the high road ?
did you hear what those smug bitches said to me ?
edie , it &apos;s important these people like us .
it &apos;s our home now .
i never should &apos;ve let you talk me into moving back here .
why ? why were you so gung ho on wisteria lane ?
listen to your husband .
we can be happy here
but we need these people to like us .
why ?
it &apos;ll just make everything easier .
that was an accident .
susan , you can &apos;t feel guilty about it .
you know what , jackson ?
you &apos;re not gonna say anything
i haven &apos;t already heard a million times .
i @-@ i only told you because i ...
i just want you to understand why i can &apos;t let you in my life .
do you mind if i hang out for the next
few months and see if you change your mind ?
yeah , i guess i could handle that .
well , why don &apos;t you ...
go have fun with your friends ?
and just call me when you &apos;re free .
please , danielle. you have no right to take him .
i have every right. he &apos;s my kid .
danielle , we agreed i would raise him .
we agreed it would be best !
you said it would be best ! i &apos;ve had no say in anything !
but i am married now , and leo &apos;s a lawyer .
so do yourself a favor and don &apos;t try to fight this !
please , danielle , we can have any arrangement you like .
please , just don &apos;t take him !
for god sakes , orson &apos;s gone .
you kids are grown. benjamin &apos;s all i have !
you &apos;re just gonna have to find something else .
honey , come to bed. it &apos;s after 2 : 00 .
the cooking show agreed to redo my segment .
i wanna make sure it &apos;s perfect this time .
well , i won &apos;t tell you how to run your business .
it &apos;s your baby .
yes , it is .
hey. um , m.j. ready ?
yeah , he &apos;s upstairs waiting for you .
i told you the brakes were squeaking .
i asked you to get them checked .
and i checked &apos; em !
i meant a mechanic ...
not you. it was not the brakes , susan .
if it had been , it wouldn &apos;t have mattered .
they crashed into us !
and we killed them , mike !
we didn &apos;t kill them ! they died .
they were a mother and a child .
she was a mother , just like me ...
with a child just like ours .
and if it weren &apos;t for us , they would still be alive .
yeah , we have been over and over this , susan .
it &apos;s--it &apos;s like you want to suffer .
it &apos;s like you don &apos;t care at all ,
like you feel nothing for those people .
i can &apos;t do this again ! i just can &apos;t !
did you pack your dinosaur book
so you can read it with your daddy ?
sure did .
oh , good. mmm .
okay , you have fun , sweetie .
so , um , i &apos;ll probably bring him back sunday around 6 : 00 or so .
fine .
well , have a good weekend. doing anything special ?
well , i &apos;ve sort of started seeing someone .
so i might do something with him .
good for you .
it goes by so quickly .
in a flash , the life we knew is gone forever .
and we &apos;re left to ask ourselves ...
how could he have left me ?
when did my beauty start to fade ?
why has my friend changed ?
was i the best mother i could have been ?
of course , there are some people
who understand how quickly time passes .
that &apos;s why they &apos;re so determined to
get what they want before it &apos;s too late .
oh , dr. heller . i &apos;ve been meaning to call you .
yeah , i was getting concerned .
you &apos;re required to check in once a month .
it was a condition of your release .
oh , come on. that was a year ago .
but to be honest , the meds are working so well ,
i kinda forgot about you .
no offense .
dave , once a month. not optional .
message received , doc .
but seriously , you don &apos;t need to worry about me . i &apos;m great .
i &apos;ll talk to you in a month .
just tell me .
what are the magic words that i &apos;ve gotta say so you will
let me out of here ?
dave , you &apos;ve been here six weeks , and
you don &apos;t seem any closer to coming to terms with your rage .
i &apos;ve come to terms with it , and i like it just the way it is .
the charges were dropped because you
agreed to put yourself in a doctor &apos;s care .
i &apos;m not going to authorize your release
until i see some real progress .
wh @-@ what &apos;s progress supposed to look like to you , doc ?
i mean ,
should i just plaster some fake smile on my face and
pretend this--this thing that &apos;s inside me isn &apos;t eatin &apos; me alive ?
&apos;cause i can do that if you want .
i need to make sure
you &apos;re not a danger to yourself or to others .
listen , i &apos;ve never been a danger to myself .
and as far as the others are concerned ,
