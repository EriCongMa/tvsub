dallas pd discovered an unidentified male body ,
with the mouth sewn shut .
like the silencer .
it &apos;s obviously a copycat .
yesterday while we were in florida ,
a body was found in the desert
outside las cruces , new mexico .
a man had his leg amputated
and replaced with the leg of someone else .
someone &apos;s out there mimicking the crimes we solved .
this is now an active case ,
which we &apos;ll be investigating along with our other cases .
i need to tell you something . maeve &apos;s missing .
i think her stalker has her .
hello . i &apos;m still here .
zug ... zwang .
zug zwang .
it &apos;s a chess term .
it describes the point in the game
when a player realizes he &apos;ll inevitably be checkmated .
please ...
let me go !
oh , god !
god can &apos;t help you now . please be quiet .
stop it .
you won &apos;t feel a thing .
alex . do you have a minute ?
i &apos;m actually trying to finish up so i can get home tonight .
you got my voicemails ?
i haven &apos;t had time to return calls .
agent hotchner tells me you &apos;re settling in nicely .
i &apos;m glad to hear it .
it &apos;s a great team .
listen , i was hoping that we could talk , over coffee , maybe .
i thought we might try to bury the hatchet once and for all .
erin , no disrespect ,
but it &apos;s not necessary .
what happened between us happened a long time ago .
i &apos;ve moved on . you should , too .
well , that &apos;s ... what i &apos;m trying to do .
look , i &apos;m not very good at this ,
but i want you to know that
i &apos;m so sorry for what i did to you .
apology accepted ?
apologies are just words .
i want to make amends ,
and that takes work .
i think blake could take her . what do you think ?
mm , their body language hardly seems adversarial .
blake &apos;s making direct eye contact ,
and the tilt of her head suggests she &apos;s willingly engaged in conversation .
didn &apos;t strauss throw her under the bus back in the day ?
it was on the amerithrax case about 10 years ago .
evidently they apprehended the wrong suspect
and she let blake take the fall .
well , i heard they even demoted her a couple grades .
guess what just came to the reception desk
for an agent jennifer jareau .
from who ?
they must be from will . or someone &apos;s got some &apos; splainin &apos; to do .
open it . open it . open it .
just ... will &apos;s not really a flower bouquet type guy .
zug zwang .
what ? let me see that .
it &apos;s the same thing diane turner said to you .
before she killed meave .
but diane said , who sent it ?
no idea .
didn &apos;t you say that the voice on the other side of the payphone
was computer generated ?
that means it could be from anybody ,
that means maybe it doesn &apos;t have anything to do with meave .
whoever it was ,
they knew you would be at that phonebooth ,
which means they were stalking you .
or us .
what if this is the replicator ?
i just came from the director &apos;s office .
he doesn &apos;t like the idea that his agents are being taunted ,
and he wants me to keep them personally in a loop .
catch me up , please ?
okey , so , the flowers cleared all security checkpoints
which means there &apos;s no explosives ,
no chemical residual , nothing .
they were ordered from a local flowerist , wendy &apos;s bloomers .
i checked wendy , her bloomers , employees ,
the delivery service . they all came out clean .
i managed to track down the credit card .
it &apos;s a stolen card number ,
and it was ordered from a prepaid cell phone in philadelphia .
but it &apos;s all about the message he &apos;s trying to send .
but they were sent to jj . why her ?
yeah , the original zugzwang taunt was directed at me .
if it &apos;s directed at one of us ,
it &apos;s directed at all of us .
it &apos;s only a matter of time before his taunts turn to threats .
i &apos;m posting security details at each of our homes .
well , he &apos;s communicating directly .
what exactly is he trying to say ?
that the game has changed . first he was chasing us ,
copying the cases that we &apos;d solved ,
and now it &apos;s our turn to chase him .
tag , we &apos;re it .
what do we know about the replicator ?
so far he &apos;s committed 3 murders in 3 different states .
the first was maxwell holmes ,
28 @-@ year @-@ old contractor ,
husband , and father of two , from dallas .
he was found with his mouth sewn shut
4 weeks after we closed the silencer case .
next is an unidentified john doe .
he was found in new mexico near the mexican border .
his leg was severed and someone else &apos;s was transplanted on .
do we have any idea where the limb comes from ?
none .
finally , megan lewinbuck ,
31 @-@ year @-@ old paralegal , single mother .
she was found in phoenix .
she was found last week .
all her joints were dislocated
and she &apos;d been turned into a human marionette .
and that &apos;s everything so far .
local police and bureau field offices
are going to keep us apprised of any developments .
i want this case closed quickly .
copycat murders , flowers sent .
i see this as an assault on the entire bureau .
uh , sir , philadelphia p.d.
just uploaded a homicide to vicap .
an unidentified woman was found this morning
exsanguinated with her eyelids removed .
it &apos;s just like our blood artist bryan hughes .
philadelphia , the same city the flowers were ordered from .
jet &apos;s standing by . wheels up in 20 .
carbon copy
&quot; imitation is the sincerest form of flattery . &quot;
charles caleb colton .
the replicator sent those flowers today
knowing that that body would be discovered .
and he &apos;s taken the time to track our cases .
it &apos;s not too much trouble
to track news headlines with a google search .
yeah , but the original zugzwang message
was delivered to me at a phone booth ,
which means he &apos;s not just tracking our cases ,
he &apos;s tracking everything we do .
why would someone do that ?
we &apos;ve been taunted before .
guys like randall garner .
usually malignant narcissists who feel the need to show off .
so maybe he wants us to see how smart he is .
but why ?
what &apos;s the point ? is it a warning ?
is he mocking us ?
maybe all of the above .
he &apos;s not attempting to hide his kills ,
so it &apos;s probably his way of bragging .
he &apos;s probably trying to lure us out .
he certainly wants our attention .
we have a total of 4 copycat murders
and no apparent connection between the victims .
my guess is they &apos;re all targets of opportunity .
who he kills doesn &apos;t matter .
the point is to get to us .
the latest victim was in philadelphia .
bryan hughes bled his victims in san francisco .
all the other copycat murders occurred in the same area
as the original kills . why is this one different ?
it &apos;s his game .
he can change the rules anytime he wants .
all that traveling-- clearly he &apos;s got the money and the time .
and patience .
his organization and attention to detail
suggests some sort of bigger plan .
greetings , crime @-@ fighters .
we just got an i.d.
on the first exsanguinated , eyelidless body .
her name is molly patton , 27 .
she was a nurse at a local hospital .
garcia , what do you mean by first ?
i mean that a second exsanguinated ,
eyelidless body was just discovered .
he &apos;s moving fast .
oh , excuse me . can i help you ?
i &apos;m agent morgan . agent jareau .
dr. spencer reid .
feds ?
what are you doing here ?
assisting the investigation .
well , no one told me .
someone just forgot to make a phone call .
just an oversight , i &apos;m sure .
yeah , i guess so .
you mind showing us the victim ?
yeah , right this way .
is there anything you can tell us about her ?
her name was sandy larson .
went missing two days ago .
she was a retired widow with 6 grandkids .
any idea where she was last seen ?
found her car at a drugstore across town .
apparently she fills a prescription every wednesday morning .
if that &apos;s where he grabbed her ,
he was probably aware of her routine .
she &apos;s fully clothed and he posed the body .
it could mean he feels remorse .
oh , yeah . i &apos;m sure he was all broken up about it .
excuse me .
rizzo .
he &apos;s replicating his replication .
all the other copycat murders were single kills ,
but this is his second exsanguination .
bryan hughes posed his victims staring directly at art .
there &apos;s nothing like that around here .
different setting , slightly different m.o.
are we sure this is the replicator ?
femoral arteries were severed in both legs .
cause of death is exsanguination .
ligature marks , like he had her strapped down .
you also found ketamine in her system ?
enough to knock us all out .
no signs of torture , and he sedated her before he bled her out .
so maybe he &apos;s not so much sadistic as mission @-@ oriented .
cops said she disappeared after her yoga class . is that true ?
that was the last place she was seen , yes .
my god . i used to practice at that same studio .
that class was 8 : 00 in the morning
and right off a busy intersection .
he grabbed his victims in broad daylight .
he &apos;s either using a ruse or a discreet threat of violence .
either way , he &apos;s awfully bold .
excuse me , miss ?
hi . would you care to sign a petition
to help clean up the delaware river ?
sorry , i don &apos;t have time right now .
did you know that the delaware river
is the fifth most polluted river in our country ?
i had no idea , but good luck .
last year , they dumped more than 6.7 million pounds
of toxic chemicals there and nobody &apos;s doing anything about it .
you are .
but they won &apos;t listen until we all speak up .
the clean water act is an unfulfilled promise
and our children are the ones paying for it .
come on , it &apos;s just a signature .
i &apos;ll even help you with your groceries .
no . no , that &apos;s ok . here , i &apos;ll sign .
oh , awesome .
thank you .
where ?
that line right there .
the pen isn &apos;t working .
sorry about that .
just grab you another one .
do not scream and do not run .
think about your son , shannon .
his name &apos;s eddie , right ?
i &apos;m sure it was just a misunderstanding .
you have our full cooperation .
isn &apos;t that right , detective ?
i thought you needed 3 murders
to have federal jurisdiction .
we have probable cause to believe that the unsub
is responsible for 3 other murders in different states .
probable cause . but you don &apos;t know for sure .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re here to determine .
look , we &apos;re wasting our time here .
we should be out there looking for this guy .
we &apos;re only here to help .
a bunch of pencil pushers and accountants . how you gonna help ?
rizzo !
i &apos;m sorry ?
hey , what &apos;s with you ? you need a hug or something ?
i need to take you off this case ?
no .
then cut the crap .
jackson .
where ?
ok , thanks .
another body just turned up .
that makes 3 .
she &apos;s at fairmont park . get out there .
and take them with you .
victim &apos;s name is shannon lavin , 29 years old .
husband said she never came home
from the grocery store this morning .
another kidnapping in broad daylight .
this is turning into a spree .
an efficient one .
it &apos;s been fewer than 12 hours since she disappeared .
we still have yet to locate her vehicle .
i bet he stole it during the abduction .
found a way to get close to her and threaten her somehow .
probably even made her drive .
what else do we know about her ?
she &apos;s got a 4 @-@ year @-@ old kid .
it &apos;s impossible to tell when or where this photo was taken .
it &apos;s shot on a telephoto lens and the frame &apos;s too small .
well , his message is getting more clear .
he &apos;s not just taunting us ,
now he &apos;s targeting us .
he must have channeled years of anger
to come up with a plan as intricate as this .
this is his way of torturing us .
this isn &apos;t just about anger . this is about revenge .
for what ?
if we can figure that out that &apos;s how we &apos;ll catch him .
so first it was reid at the phone booth ,
then me with the flowers ,
now hotch . which one of us is next ?
cause of death is definitely exsanguination .
she only has about half a liter left .
same ligature marks as the others .
was there ketamine in the system ?
tox screen &apos;s not back , but it &apos;s a safe bet .
her liver is inflamed and she &apos;s slightly jaundiced .
see that a lot with ketamine overdoses .
body snatchers told me
they found a picture of you at the crime scene .
we believe that the unsub is targeting us personally , yes .
he &apos;s using these victims to send us some kind of message .
what kind of message ?
we &apos;re not sure yet .
i hope you catch him soon .
hey , aaron .
she was a nurse .
just like molly patton .
at your service , sir .
garcia , i need you to find out everything you can
about our second victim sandy larson .
copy that , uh ...
she was a baby boomer , originally from chicago .
her husband saul died 10 years ago from pancreatic cancer .
employment ?
she was retired , but before that ,
she worked as an administrator at a hospice care facility .
anything before that ?
before that , she was a ...
she was a registered nurse for 30 years .
that &apos;s the connection .
i need you to go to vicap and find out everything you can
about homicides involving nurses .
i am like the wind . back in a flash .
where &apos;s that lightning ? anyway ...
we &apos;ve got a video conference with strauss in 10 minutes .
she on the warpath ?
she &apos;s under a lot of pressure to get results . we all are .
well , i &apos;ve seen her under pressure before .
it was right when she tried to ruin my career .
this psychopath &apos;s message is clearly personal
and it &apos;s making us look bad .
someone profiling our profilers
undermines the efficacy of everything you do ,
and i &apos;m going to be frank with you--
both the director and the attorney general
want to take you off this case ,
and i can &apos;t say i totally disagree .
why ?
because you &apos;re victims now , and i &apos;m concerned
your ability to investigate may be compromised .
yeah , well , i assure you our abilities are just fine .
is that true , aaron ?
yes , it is , ma &apos;am , absolutely .
we know this case better than anyone .
all right . well , i &apos;ll tell the director
if he takes you off the case ,
it &apos;s either with my resignation or over my dead body .
ma &apos;am , we &apos;re starting the briefing now .
i &apos;ll be right there .
you catch this son of a bitch , aaron .
understood .
do you really think they &apos;d replace us ?
sounds like you &apos;d have to kill strauss first ,
and i doubt if that &apos;s as easy as it sounds .
all right , so what do we know ?
this photo isn &apos;t digital .
it was printed on real chromogenic photo paper .
so he &apos;s old school .
we &apos;re still trying to ascertain when the photo was taken .
garcia , i &apos;m putting you on speaker .
you guys , there are a shocking number
of weirdoes out there who have a thing for nurses .
but i got a gigantenormous hit .
15 years ago , the bau had a case in pittsburgh
involving the stabbing murders of 4 nurses .
pittsburgh ? that &apos;s close enough to be related .
that rings a bell .
but i didn &apos;t work that case , gideon did .
yeah , yeah . it ended relatively well .
the killer jack lee kemper was caught ,
and we managed to save one of his would @-@ be victims .
garcia , what happened to kemper ?
he died 5 months ago from lethal injection .
what if that was the trigger ?
the silencer copycat murder happened about 5 months ago .
we believe we &apos;re looking for
a white male in his mid @-@ 40s or possibly even 50s .
he &apos;s criminally and forensically sophisticated ,
so he may be an ex @-@ con or have law enforcement training .
you saying he could be a cop ?
it &apos;s unlikely , but we can &apos;t rule it out .
this unsub is using his victims as a device
with which to antagonize the fbi , the bau in particular .
so he &apos;s after you .
he &apos;s been copycatting murder cases
that we &apos;ve closed all over the country .
we do have reason to believe
that he &apos;s been stalking each member of this team .
so he &apos;s extremely mobile and has the time
and the means with which to get around .
and the intelligence to cover his tracks and remain evasive .
we think it all started
15 years ago with a case we had in pittsburgh
that involved the death of 4 nurses .
that killer , jack lee kemper , was apprehended ,
and he was recently executed .
because the most recent exsanguination victims were also nurses ,
we believe this case holds some kind of special meaning to him .
so we should be looking at kemper &apos;s family ,
friends , and associates .
they may be trying to avenge his death ,
or they might be convinced that he was wrongfully accused .
we should also look at friend and relatives of the victims .
they may blame us for not solving the case fast enough .
this unsub is intelligent and highly organized ,
but he &apos;s also hellbent on revenge .
which makes him especially dangerous .
thank you .
where the hell have you been ?
you were supposed to call me hours ago .
we had a deal .
well , why set a time if you &apos;re not gonna stick to it ?
you know how i hate that !
it &apos;s inconsiderate , never mind rude .
ok . ok , you &apos;re right , i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry .
thank you for calling me back .
there &apos;s just been a lot going on .
nothing . nothing . just ... work and stuff .
don &apos;t worry about it .
well , we &apos;ve ruled out every name on the list .
our guy &apos;s not connected to jack lee kemper &apos;s victims .
you know , if they were just friends or lovers ,
there might not be an official record of their relationship .
the only living relative
kemper has is a third cousin who lives in alaska .
well , it wasn &apos;t one of his friends .
kemper didn &apos;t have any .
he was a recluse with no social skills .
well , who else would have a vendetta against us ?
it could be a fan of kemper &apos;s .
these guys always seem to have followers .
what about somebody we put into prison ?
it &apos;s a little hard to orchestrate all of this from behind bars .
what if somebody from the outside &apos;s helping him ?
and how about other suspects in the case ?
that &apos;s it .
what ?
bidwell . donnie bidwell .
of course .
he was the primary suspect before we caught kemper .
we had a strong circumstantial case ,
but dna eventually cleared him .
his name got leaked to the press the second we grabbed him .
why so fast ?
we thought it was probably someone in the local p.d.
how long did we hold him for ?
couple of weeks .
give me stuff to do !
garcia , i need everything you &apos;ve got on donnie bidwell .
he was a suspect in the jack lee kemper case .
righty @-@ o .
ok , he was picked up a couple of times for assault and lewd behavior .
he got off with time served and probation .
he is a recently divorced father of two .
he cannot hold down a job .
i count 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ...
12 jobs in the last 10 years ,
everything from fry cook to used car salesman .
yeah , but before all that
he was in construction or something , right ?
affirmative . he owned his own hot mop shower pan company ,
whatever that is . that business went south after the arrest .
his legal fees wiped him out , and then a year later--
oh , dear , he had himself a nervous breakdown .
no wonder he wants payback . that accusation ruined his life .
have you got an address ?
yeah , i got home and work and i &apos;m sending both .
thanks .
we better make sure we get this right
before we arrest this guy again .
rossi , blake , and reid take the work address .
the rest of us will take the house .
clear .
clear !
gun !
he &apos;s going out back !
are you ok ?
he &apos;s heading south .
fbi ! don &apos;t move .
drop the gun . do it now !
drop it !
slow .
slowly .
now turn around .
i said turn around !
what &apos;s the matter ? a little tight ?
my bad . let &apos;s go .
agent morgan .
hey , listen .
i just wanted to say , uh ...
thank you .
don &apos;t mention it .
no , no , no , you--
you saved my life .
i owe you .
no , detective rizzo , you don &apos;t owe me anything .
we &apos;re both on the same team here .
so , uh ...
5 years ago my partner was
was shot and killed ,
we were assisting on a federal case .
ever since then , i just ...
i get it .
i do .
it &apos;s all good .
i &apos;m sorry about your partner .
if there &apos;s ever anything you need--
anything .
i appreciate that .
this guy ask for his phone call yet ?
no . just for these .
they &apos;re anticonvulsants .
just a few weeks after his arrest , he got jumped in a bar .
police report said the guys who did it
thought he was the nurse killer .
he took a blow to the head
and he &apos;s had a seizure disorder ever since .
can i get you anything else ?
you know , i , uh ... heh ,
i wasn &apos;t on that case , but i remember you .
you probably recall my associate ,
agent jason gideon .
too bad he retired .
he should be here to see this .
yeah , you know , i know that things went pretty bad with you
after that whole thing .
i don &apos;t blame you for being angry .
we made an erroneous accusation .
oh , is that what you call it ?
erroneous ?
my life went in the toilet .
well , you got judged in the court of public opinion .
that &apos;s gotta be hard .
i mean , i &apos;d want payback , too .
don &apos;t sit there and pretend like you know how this feels .
you have no idea .
found this in the hall closet .
it &apos;s all about the nurse murders 15 years ago .
there &apos;s two sets of files ,
one about his arrest , the other about jack lee kemper .
it &apos;s not surprising he obsessed over the case .
hotchner .
oh , sir , hi , it &apos;s me .
garcia , whose number is this ?
sorry . i had anderson give me a ride .
i desperately needed a shower
and some food that wasn &apos;t sold in a machine .
ok , so i cleaned out bidwell &apos;s computer
and i checked his phone records .
he mostly calls his ex @-@ wife . a lot of emails , too .
it is not a pretty picture .
they separated a few years ago .
she took the kids with her .
they just recently got the divorce finalized .
she &apos;s already pregnant with another guy &apos;s kid .
when was the divorce finalized ?
uh , 5 months .
this might not have been about kemper &apos;s execution at all .
the divorce might have been the stressor .
oh , and , sir , his ex @-@ wife , she &apos;s a nurse .
come on , donnie ,
help me to help you .
we were wrong about you the first time .
don &apos;t you want to make sure that we get it right this time ?
well , i &apos;ll tell you what .
i &apos;ll give you a few more minutes to think about it , ok ?
something &apos;s not right .
this is his crowning moment .
all that work he did to replicate those murders .
he should be singing like a canary .
mm @-@ hmm . especially if he &apos;s a narcissist .
i want to try something .
hi , donnie .
i &apos;m agent blake .
you &apos;ve already met my associate agent jareau .
sure you don &apos;t want to take your meds ?
go ahead .
you know , i was reading through your file ,
and i saw that you had two kids .
girls , right ?
that &apos;s sophie and laura ?
lauren .
right .
they &apos;re beautiful .
i have a little boy .
and i don &apos;t know what i &apos;d do if someone took him from me .
i know your girls are older now ,
but think about how hard this is gonna be for them .
if you cooperate with us ,
you can make things much easier for everyone .
his car &apos;s got almost 100,000 miles on it .
you think he drove cross @-@ country to replicate those murders ?
well , with his sporadic work schedule , it &apos;s possible .
plus , it &apos;s cheaper than flying .
hotch .
it &apos;s printed on photographic paper also .
those are eyelids .
yeah .
i &apos;ll let the rest of the team know .
that sounds terrible .
one day i just came home from work and they were gone .
poof .
did your wife ever say anything about leaving ?
not a word .
she just packed up the girls and left .
they &apos;re my kids .
my kids .
they were so little then . they didn &apos;t understand .
it &apos;s hard .
hard ?
hard ?
you ruined my li ..
i was arrested for no reason .
i was publicly humiliated .
my face smeared all over the news .
they treated me like garbage .
i was behind bars for weeks .
i was innocent .
but people &apos;s lives stink so bad
that they just love when they can watch
somebody else take a fall . it &apos;s like a car wreck .
they can &apos;t take their eyes off of it .
i know you .
you &apos;re that guy on the news .
all i could do was suck on it .
no , no , no-- that wasn &apos;t me .
15 years . 15 years and not a peep from the fbi .
no letter , no email , no &quot; sorry we turned your life
upside down , donnie . &quot; nothing !
well , it must feel real good to release it after all these years .
you &apos;re damn right .
those nurses that i bled out , this time they &apos;re your fault .
you people made me into this .
alright , so that is why you followed us across the country
and copycatted these ?
you wanted us to look as bad as you did .
i mean , it &apos;s just an awful lot of work , donnie .
we have new mexico ,
uh , dallas ,
d.c.
what are those ?
what are you talking about ?
we found your photo collection , the one hidden under your bed .
and your victims &apos; eyelids , too .
what ?
just cooperate with us , donnie ,
tell us everything ,
and give yourself a chance to see your girls again .
i want my lawyer .
i have a phone call . i get a phone call .
ok .
that doesn &apos;t make sense .
he just admitted to killing the nurses ,
and the second i bring up the copycat murders ,
he lawyers up .
he looked as if this was all news to him .
check him out . he &apos;s a bundle of nerves .
it could all be an act .
he might still be trying to manipulate us .
well , if he is gonna lawyer up , that &apos;s a privileged conversation .
come on , i &apos;ll buy us a cup of coffee .
yeah , thanks , dave .
so bidwell confessed to the exsanguinations ,
but he wants to see his lawyer before he admits to anything else .
we &apos;ve found more than enough evidence to prove he &apos;s the replicator .
i had the same thought ,
but the house doesn &apos;t fit the profile . it &apos;s too sloppy .
he is a single male .
but the plan to get to us was detailed and organized
and nothing in this house says that .
hello ?
it &apos;s me .
i &apos;ve been arrested .
you ...
he probably wasn &apos;t expecting to get caught so soon .
so maybe we threw a wrench in his master plan .
which is what ?
we got a problem . it &apos;s bidwell .
he was only alone for a second .
he took them all .
someone get the paramedics !
i just talked to strauss .
she wants an update . what happened ?
bidwell died en route to the hospital .
this guy did not profile as suicidal .
it &apos;s bizarre . if he wanted payback , why would he kill himself ?
maybe this is his version of payback .
if he takes his own life , we can &apos;t put him in prison .
like the ultimate escape plan .
but his body language-- you should have seen it .
when jj mentioned the copycat murders ,
he had no idea what she was talking about .
something went wrong and he called an audible .
so what made him change the plan ?
well , he did it after his phone call ,
so i &apos;m guess that had something to do with it .
that &apos;s a dead end .
local police traced the number to a prepaid cell phone .
garcia said it went dead right after bidwell &apos;s call .
a partner ?
well , if he really didn &apos;t know about the other copycat murders ,
he wouldn &apos;t be somebody &apos;s partner , he would be their pawn .
so what if all the evidence in bidwell &apos;s house
was put there just so that we &apos;d find it ?
jazz hands at the ready .
garcia , i need you to go over
all of donnie bidwell &apos;s phone records again .
and any emails , social media ,
whatever you can find .
but why do i have to check it again ?
his emails were squeaky clean
and he wasn &apos;t into social media .
the key is in the phone calls .
they had to have communication somehow .
ok , most of his cell phone conversations
were to his ex @-@ wife in new york .
he called his mom in tampa once a week .
the rest are just random .
he called local businesses , he checked movie times .
come on , baby girl , it isn &apos;t random .
the answer &apos;s in there somewhere . you just gotta find it .
all right , if you say so .
i will re @-@ get this party started . hit you back .
if the replicator &apos;s still out there ,
then this whole thing &apos;s part of a much bigger manipulation .
i wonder what he &apos;s planning for an encore .
go ahead , garcia .
i want to preface this by saying
i did not break any rules by getting this info so fast .
i may have scraped , scratched ,
massaged , but no breaks . not a one .
garcia .
ok . i checked the incoming phone records
and there was a call that caught my eye ,
&apos;cause for the last 6 months , that call came in
at the same time at the same day , except for once .
it &apos;s from an unknown phone number ,
so i did what i do and i made the number known ,
and it was from a prepaid cell phone .
here &apos;s the kicker . oh , get ready .
it was paid for with the same stolen credit card
used to buy jj &apos;s flowers . what ? bam !
can you triangulate the number ?
why ask me that question ? triangulation is just about
my favorite thing to do . that phone is in pittsburgh .
that &apos;s a 5 @-@ hour drive .
or about 45 minutes on the jet .
yes , ma &apos;am . swat is meeting us on the ground .
all right , i will keep you posted . thank you .
strauss isn &apos;t altogether comfortable
with us going on this takedown ,
but i told her that pittsburgh p.d. would take the lead .
you know , if the replicator used bidwell ,
then somehow he had to convince him
to exsanguinate those women .
and cut off their eyelids .
bidwell was broken and vulnerable .
he was ripe for a manipulation .
the replicator must have counted on that .
that &apos;s probably why he chose bidwell in the first place .
well , he must be one persuasive guy .
persuasive enough to turn bidwell into a killer .
talk to me , mama .
you &apos;re on the right track .
that phone hasn &apos;t been used and hasn &apos;t moved .
make the next left .
i got it .
guys , i don &apos;t like this .
it feels like we &apos;re going exactly where he wants us to .
all right . the snipers are set and all the exits are covered .
air support ?
choppers are standing by .
all right , the signal from the cell phone &apos;s coming from this room .
we &apos;ll enter in two teams . you from this side ,
we &apos;ll come from this side ,
we &apos;ll meet in the middle .
all right , guys , i need you to keep it tight and stay alert .
this guy &apos;s got a vendetta against us . it could be an ambush .
all right , gents , on the move .
it &apos;s clear .
