i &apos;m on the verge of bankruptcy .

that will undo the terrible damage done by my other schemes .
i have an appointment with a nigerian king
to negotiate a uranium deal that will put me right back on top .
huh . nothing can stop you , sir .
but , uh , not that you &apos;re not at the top of your game .
uh , what if you don &apos;t get the deal ?
i &apos;ll just have to sell everything
and move to the south pacific with you .
what a grim fate that would be .
and with your omelet ,
would you like the fried potatoes or the mixed berries ?
i &apos;ll have the berries .
a terrible fate indeed , sir .
oh , no . my almond milk leaked all over everything .
dad , do you have anything i can eat ?
oh , uh , i will turn this corn chip into a wonderful meal ,
using my greatest skill-- lunchroom trading !

then the body &apos;s harshest critic-- the colon .
okay , sweetie , open those baby blacks .
wow , dad .
thank you .
welcome , your majesty .
mr. burns , i don &apos;t know what you have heard ,
but i do not eat monkey brains from a skull .

during our complicated negotiations ,
i need someone to look after her ,
keep her out of trouble .
that man is the perfect choice .

fair comment .
i haven &apos;t eaten all day .

uh , we don &apos;t know what kind of bird they turn into .
but there &apos;s a string cheese or something
in the fridge in the back . uh , help yourself .
all right , after she eats , i &apos;d better close up .
oh . come on , pal .

that &apos;s really stuck there good .
ah , i can &apos;t be mad at her no more .
good night , moon .

good night , eggs .
good night , dregs .
good night , bugs crawlin &apos; up my legs .
good night , beer . good night , mice .
good night , princess who treats me nice .
so my offer for one ton of your uranium is a goat .
will you stop offering me that ?
i come from a modern nation of 90 million people .
two goats .
you are starting to insult me .
all right , let &apos;s cut to the chase .
my board has given me permission to go up to 12 goats .
how about here , sir ?
looks good to me .
i &apos;m so sorry i pretended not to be gay for all those years .
well , better an old queen than never a queen at all .
pay attention .
my last offer -- 20 million goats .
okay , but no dogs disguised as goats .
oh , great , here comes the haggling .
well , well , look who &apos;s up .
uh , princess , i &apos;m gonna do something for you
i &apos;ve never done for anyone in this bar . call you a cab .
no . i want to spend time with you .
i want to see this town .
do you mind ridin &apos; a cute little scooter
with your arms around my waist ?
i don &apos;t .
to the scooter store .
and after you eat the soup you can eat the bowl
or you can put &quot; kerns &quot; in it .
what , uh , whatever you like .
i have a confession to make .
this is my first montage .
just relax and enjoy the music .
moe szyslak .
this is the part of the fairy tale
where the princess goes back to the hotel and watches tv .
come with me .
so where are we headed , dude ?
just go and go fast .
okay , um , usually i do kind of a funny take
on an airline pilot greeting the passengers . you know , like ,
&quot; hey . thank you for flying air kevin . if you look out
to the left of the pedicab , you ... &quot;
just move the pedals .
whoa , sounds like the tower
has cleared us for takeoff .
we &apos;re tryin &apos; to escape that guy .
well , dude , as long as he can run , he can beat us .
so , anyways , the place that i really feel the pedaling ?
it &apos;s my legs .
okay , all right , we &apos;re safe .
actually , i wanted to go back with him .
i don &apos;t want to get my father mad .
go back ? but i didn &apos;t show you the place
where dave grohl got mugged .
i have to leave , but i still had a wonderful day .
thank god i shaved my forehead this morning .
a paparazzo . please don &apos;t send that .
if my father sees it , it will ruin my life .
well , thanks for making it so easy .
and you have the 20 million goats ?
two , now .
19,999,998
on delivery .
very good .
um , shouldn &apos;t we
see how the princess is doing
before you sign , your majesty ?
what are you talking about , smithers ?
i can &apos;t even trust you
to watch an impetuous adult who does what she wants .
the deal is off .
wow . after spending my life serving others ,
i &apos;m finally gonna get what i want .
uh , uh , sir , there may be a bright side .
there &apos;s never a bright side .
he &apos;s almost mine .
yes , you &apos;ve torn that up , all right .
father , i want to explain .
i was a young woman who wanted to see the world ,
and this kind man has shown it to me .
and stolen your heart .
eh , well , that &apos;s what i do . uh , sorry ,
but there ain &apos;t no off switch for this .
he has not stolen my heart .
wha ? !
why has he made the ancient tribal sound of confusion ?
i think he is a sweet , sweet man .
but when i kissed him on the forehead ,
it was not romantic .
more like when snow white kissed dopey .
oh , no , no , not this comparison again .
i &apos;m sorry , moe . i don &apos;t love you .
but i really like you .
well , daughter , even though you have done nothing
seriously wrong , first i will tear this contract
one more time .
and as for you , your punishment will be ...
uh , may i speak to you , majesty ,
father to father ?
a woman has allowed you to sire her children ?
there was beer involved . i have two daughters .
and i &apos;ve learned you have to let them go their own way .
even the one @-@ year @-@ old .
majesty .
and the older one , i can &apos;t tell her what to do .
and she &apos;s only 12 .
eight .
see what i mean ? always an argument .
but the thing you have to remember is
that you have to let them be who they are
because you love them .
i am not convinced .
uh , because you want them to grow .
still not convinced .
and because you can &apos;t strangle a girl .
that makes sense .
oh ... come here , daughter .
oh , father .
little girl , let me give you some advice .
never dream big , because it will blow up in your face .
you &apos;re talking to the girl
who wants a career in jazz .
oh , poor thing .
so the good king &apos;s cheap uranium will
allow me to sell you expensive nuclear power .
everyone wins .
yes , yes . princess .
can you tell us about the man you kissed ?
uh , yeah , i &apos;ll field that .
uh , yesterday , a local man
&quot; may or may not &quot; have given a tour
to a certain princess , who , uh , one assumes ,
turned all his thoughts of revenge
to love and then love to respect .
and yesterday , a certain princess
may or may not have seen much of your world
with a certain man ,
and she certainly might be eternally grateful .
oh , this is vague stuff . vague stuff !
i did not think this through .
moe , before i left ,
i just wanted to give you these examples
of our most beloved ,
albeit depressing , literature .
ah , some nice bedtime readin &apos; .
fun premise .
i &apos;m laughing already .
really not cheerin &apos; me up here ,
but , uh , let me offer you the only literature
in this bar-- sure works for me , though .
this coaster .
i will treasure it .
well , i guess you &apos;ll pine forever
for a man who doesn &apos;t care ,
while i just grow old here in this bar .
yeah . here &apos;s to suffering in silence .
mm . can &apos;t wait to see those numbers hanging from my rafters .
i can &apos;t believe it &apos;s been
three years since smithers left .
man , have i been aging badly .
but i guess i can finally wash this forehead .
oh , divine .
oh , god , what do you want ?
well , neighbor , now that your streak of rum luck
is at its end , i have a favor to ask .
it involves charity .
i &apos;ve set up the virgin earth challenge ,
a $ 25 million prize
to eliminate greenhouse gases ,
that i was hoping you would add to .
where are the hounds when i need them ?
they &apos;re on a free virgin galactic flight around the world .
can you go five blasted minutes
without saying the word &quot; virgin &quot; ?
that &apos;s another virgin challenge .
that i will not be virgin taking . virgin .
