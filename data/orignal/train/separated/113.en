第六季 第十二集
That's all that happened. I was sitting over there, minding my...
Sir, all I'm asking...
all I'm asking...
I did nothing wrong.
And I didn't say you did anything wrong.
There was no sign saying I couldn't sit in that area.
I just need to know what the problem was back there.
The problem was I'm black.
Hey, sir.
No, seriously, all I was doing was
I need you to calm down.
sitting there until it was time
to pick up my wife and kids.
Sir?
迈克尔·布朗被枪杀后的事件有关
What's happening, buddy?
Nothing, I've got to go pick up my wife and kids.
No, you're under arrest.
What? I-I didn't do anything wrong.
Put your hands behind your back.
Please take your hands off me.
Put your hands behind your back.
Hey, I did nothing wrong, all right?
Don't make me use this.
Oh, now you're gonna shoot me?
I said...
For what? For...
No, don't do it.
No!
No! Oh, my God!
You're killing me.
Cole!
Tonight, a jury continues to hear evidence
about the death of Cole Willis.
Willis' death at the hands of two police officers,
Michael and Trenton, places Chicago
on a growing list of cities protesting racial injustice
by local law enforcement.
You'll definitely be asked about this.
Are these two cops guilty of, you know,
involuntary manslaughter?
Well, I can't comment on it-- the trial's still going on.
It's not still going on.
I have a friend in the courthouse.
The judge just finished jury instructions.
Geez, talk about the luck.
Well, I still can't comment on it.
Uh, Prady won't have any problem commenting on it--
he wants the black vote, he will play up the,
you know, the blah-blah-blah.
Here, let me take the jacket.
Excuse me, can you do this another time?
She goes on in 20 minutes. When do you advise I take in the arms?
If you want something to eat, I can make you a sandwich.
No, nothing to eat, it'll make her want to throw up onstage.
How about peanuts?
No, now go away, crazy lady!
Okay, okay, okay, just listen.
You show support to the police,
but you also argue the best way to support the police...
And let's lose the necklace.
It's less fussy.
Why didn't you do this before?
I need to see it on the body.
Okay, we have 18 minutes to go, let's hold it together.
Josh, step away for a second.
Me. I'm the only one doing my job.
Okay, take a breath.
Where's Jon?
Who?
Elfman.
Oh, I don't know.
He'll be here. Why?
Never mind.
Take a breath.
Okay, the bad news is you're six points down.
The good news is this is your chance to take it to him.
Okay?
Prady won't be expecting it.
We've lowered expectations.
So don't be afraid to interrupt him.
Tell him, "That's not true!"
She's eight points down.
She needs to shake you.
She'll interrupt you, try to get you to insist on the rules.
But don't rise to the bait.
Right, just roll with the punches, you're the frontrunner.
Give off the air of the frontrunner,
she'll look desperate.
He's a stickler for rules.
He'll complain to the moderator,
and that'll make him look small.
Uh-oh, you're getting a call from work, a client.
No, not right now.
What are you doing? We're in countdown mode.
She has to focus.
They say it's important.
Okay, just take a message, I'll call them back.
It's Neil Gross.
I have to take it.
He's our biggest client.
Just give me a second.
Alicia!
What's the problem, Mr. Gross?
Yeah, they're saying $30 million.
$30 million.
I thought I said no higher than $15 million.
Uh, you did say $15 million.
Who's saying $30 million?
I don't know, some guy, your lawyer.
I don't even know who he is.
Um, Evan?
Oh, Evan.
Yeah, he's a... he's a good lawyer.
Yeah, well, you need to protect me-- I have a prenup.
I don't know why I'm paying an arm and a leg.
Just so you know, Alicia, I'm thinking about leaving.
Oh, don't do that, Mr. Gross.
Why? You're running for office.
I don't even... I don't even recognize these people.
Come on, get your clothes on.
Okay,
let me look into it, and I'll get back to you.
Good.
I'm unhappy.
Let's put this down here,
we don't want to make it look like you're trying too hard.
There's been a last-minute change-- we need to show you something.
All right, I just need a second.
Alicia, it's eight minutes until you go on.
And they changed the clock.
You know, the, uh, the, um, you know, countdown thing.
It's digital now.
Okay, I'll tell her,
I'll tell her.
I need you to see it...
Can I have Diane or Cary, please?
It's digital now.
Ah, thank you, thank you so much.
I have to confess, I feel like I'm 60 years older.
But I've missed this,
Diane?
I miss just-just being,
talking about something other than going to prison.
Um, but, uh, yeah, it's been...
It's Alicia.
I'm back now and I'm ready to pitch in,
so whatever you guys need, just...
Alicia, how are you?
I think you're going on in about two minutes.
Yes, um, look, I just got a call from Neil Gross.
He's very upset about his divorce settlement.
He called you? Why?
He said that Evan is offering $30 million
and he's threatening to leave the firm.
Well, this is a surprise to me.
We agreed to go no higher than $15 million.
I know. There could be a chance that Evan is freelancing.
Look, I have to go on, could you take care of it?
Uh, yes. Good luck, kick ass.
Kalinda, do you have a minute?
One second.
What's wrong?
I think you may need to suit up sooner than you expected.
My client is ruined, sir.
She's not "Ruined."
She has the house in Brentwood,
the apartment in San Francisco.
Emotionally ruined, scarred, distraught.
You slept with my best friend, I can't believe it.
You slept with my competitor.
That was a pre-existing relationship.
Which you then renewed.
Where are we, Evan?
We're agreeing on an amount.
And we said $30 million isn't enough.
$30 million? How did we get to $30 million?
We didn't get to $30 million,
your lawyer offered $30 million, and we said that wasn't enough.
Why did you offer $30 million?
I'll show you why.
Photos.
You may want to avert your eyes, dear.
This is you, Mr. Gross, in bed with your ski instructor.
That's why your new head of family law,
the one you promoted after I left,
offered $30 million to settle.
Because these photos will not look good on TMZ.
That's intimidation, Mr. Lee.
A class three felony.
Yes, if I indeed threatened you,
but I did not. I just know
how salacious photos tend to find their way onto the Web.
Evan's always been our toughest negotiator.
I don't understand.
What changed?
Did David Lee hire Evan originally?
You think he's intimidated by his old boss?
I think he might be.
No.
Could you give me a half hour?
Why? What's going on?
I think that David Lee is offering him a job,
but Evan's too afraid to bite the hand that will feed him.
Okay, so we put a pause in the negotiation,
see if we should replace Evan.
What?
I've missed this.
All the usual disasters.
Do you want some water? You should hydrate.
Chris Matthews. I am so glad to be doing this.
Oh, hello, I'm so glad you could.
With you two running for State's Attorney,
how could I not?
I'll see you out there.
See you out there.
Okay, I know, three minutes till you're on.
Here are the key points again.
Okay, wait, wait, we've got a problem.
I just got a call from one of the reporters,
and we got to think fast.
Which one?
Patrick Mancini.
With the, um, Middeleton Herald.
He's the one on the end right there.
He's a real jackass. What does he want?
He's, uh...
got photos of the governor with Ramona Lytton.
Leaving her apartment.
From when? When were they taken?
Uh, two days ago.
He plans on making that his first question.
Eli, what is going on?
I thought he broke it off.
Yeah, stuck it in and broke it off.
Okay, let's not jump to conclusions.
I will talk to him, but in the meantime,
I wouldn't rise to the bait.
How do we not rise to the bait? He's got the whole thing documented.
Let my office deal with this-- defer to us.
We've got three minutes.
Uh, Alicia, you're getting a call.
No, not now.
Uh, from the governor.
Don't take it.
He probably got a call from Mancini, too.
There is nothing you can say right now
that'll make this any easier.
Just try and relax.
I'm away from my phone at the moment,
so please leave a message.
Are you ready, Mr. Governor?
Yes, I am, Pastor.
And I want to thank you for inviting me.
No, it's best if we can all talk with one voice.
Yes.
The fate of Officers Michael and Trenton
are now in the hands of a jury.
Um, can you just give me one second?
Eli, where are you?
Coming to you.
Don't answer any questions about Ramona.
They have photos of the two of you.
From when?
Two nights ago.
Have they asked Alicia about it?
Not yet, but they may in the debate.
Just don't answer any calls, let me work on this for a while.
It's Bill Duncan.
Oh, great, it's reached full saturation.
Mr. Governor, I'll be there in a minute.
Bill, hey.
What are you hearing about the verdict?
What?
No.
Are you serious? We are on the verge of a race riot.
And you're asking me about the governor's sex life?!
Race riot?
Really?
No, I will not dignify that.
Just call me again when you get serious.
Yep, black people.
Just can't help themselves, can they?
I'm not saying you'll riot.
Oh, thanks.
Well, you're not like other...
...people.
What other people?
Black people?
No.
What, am I not black enough?
No... y-yes...
You're more suburban.
Why am I even here?
What?
Eli, you never want me out of the office.
Tonight?
You wanted me with you.
I thought it was just a perk of the job.
Okay.
Well, I'm your black shield tonight, okay?
It's Roger Hailman.
Yeah, he's my friend at the courthouse.
Roger, hey, what's up?
Ladies and gentlemen, please take your seats.
We go live in 90 seconds.
You can't defer to governor's office.
That's like throwing the "You know" to the sharks.
I agree, but what does she say?
All marriages have their, uh, their blah-blahs, their trials.
That's acknowledging the premise of the question.
He slept with prostitutes.
I think the premise has been acknowledged.
"What does this have to do with my job as state's attorney?"
How is that not accepting the premise of the question?
Questioning the question.
Okay, guys, guys.
I am gonna say it's none of their business.
It is their business, and that'll make you look defensive.
Say Peter and you have to trust each other.
No, she'll look like a doormat.
Can you let me finish?
What?
Dad just texted me. He can't get ahold of you.
The last one we want to hear from right now is the governor.
No, the jury is coming in.
What, wait, what?
The Cole Willis jury is coming in right now.
They just went out, are you kidding me?
They deliberated for ten minutes.
Well, we need a response, they're gonna ask... See, look.
Okay, if they find the cops guilty...
They're not gonna find the cops guilty.
Not after ten minutes of blah-ing.
If the verdict comes back not guilty,
then we have to make a comment.
No, it's too early
we don't know where this is going yet.
I'm not saying she has to come out pro-cop or anti-cop...
Guys, guys.
Okay, thanks.
Good evening, and welcome to the debate
for Cook County State's Attorney,
coming to you from the ballroom of the Bonaventure Hotel.
Remember, in terms of the affair,
the charges are unsubstantiated.
And you want to handle it
within the sanctity of your marriage.
And don't get provocative with the jury verdict.
That could go either way.
Don't be thrown by the countdown clock--- it's, uh, digital.
Blinks green when you have ten seconds left.
Green? Why does it blink green?
Why not red?
I don't know.
To screw with us.
Oh, and meet Prady halfway across the stage to shake his hand.
Your mic is live, so say,
"Good to see you, Frank."
You got it?
What?
You got it?
"Good to see you, Frank."
And now I'd like to introduce the two candidates,
Alicia Florrick and Frank Prady.
Good luck, you'll be great.
Good to see you again, Alicia.
Good to see you, too, Frank.
There are limits on the applause later,
but for now, why don't we all give them a big hand?
"Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs,
"for I will not hear the melody of thy viols.
"But let justice roll down as waters
and righteousness as a mighty stream."
Now, that's why we're here.
Not for the sweet words of flattery,
but for justice, peace.
You can't get ahold of him?
What do you mean, you can't get ahold of him?
The mayor is in New Hampshire.
You're kidding.
It's not a bad thing.
Looks like rank selfishness on his part.
Yes, except we're trying to stop a riot from happening here.
interrupt the debate...
All right, get me his chief of staff.
I have her on hold right now.
So what? He's taking a run for president?
Eli! Sorry to keep you waiting.
This must be about the verdict.
Yes. The governor is worried
about the mayor being indisposed.
Okay, well, tell him not to worry, Eli.
The mayor and I have been on the phone for the last hour.
Really? How'd he do that?
I've been watching him on a live feed at a fund-raiser in Concord.
Are you and I gonna have trouble tonight, Eli?
Not unless this explodes on us.
Okay, it won't explode.
The mayor canceled all furloughs,
we have 800 extra officers on the street,
in riot gear, with tear gas.
而大陪审团决定不提起诉讼 引发抗议
They're going full Ferguson on this, sir.
Oh, come on, Eli, this is hardly an equivalent situation.
Put me on with her.
Hold on.
Hello, Franny.
Listen to me. Can you hear me?
Uh, yes, Mr. Governor. How are you this evening?
I'm fine. I'm at the interdenominational conference downtown
and I need you to get your ass down here right now,
or I'm gonna drag the mayor through the mud.
I'm sorry, I'm not sure what mud you're talking about.
You know damn well what mud I'm talking about.
Now, I gave the mayor early warning on this verdict,
and he's still sitting on his ass in New Hampshire,
thinking he can sit this out and blame me.
Well, you can tell him
that I'm the one in front of the cameras with the megaphone.
You have to understand,
there were no flights, so it's...
Wow. All right, let's go.
Questions will be asked of both candidates on a rotating basis,
with the first candidate given 45 seconds to respond,
the second candidate, 30 seconds of rebuttal.
If that rebuttal mentions the other candidate by name,
that candidate will have 20 seconds to respond.
Both candidates will also have ten seconds to ask the other
a direct question.
Unless, of course, the candidate has exceeded his or her time,
and then, that candidate will have the option
of adding to their time, but only by subtracting it
from their closing arguments.
There will also be a lightning round in which both candidates
will have ten seconds to respond.
Mr. Prady, you have 15 seconds.
I come in with a clean slate.
I have no bureaucratic grudges.
Nothing to prove.
All I see
is a city that needs a new way,
and I want to be that new way.
Mrs. Florrick.
I hear that a lot.
A new way, a new approach to crime on our streets.
But no matter what,
whenever I vote for that person,
we end up right where we started.
We end up with...
um, uh, the murder rate continually climbing.
We end up...
In short, inexperience is not a value. .
Mrs. Florrick, your time is up. It is something to be..
Mr. Prady, in about ten minutes
we'll have a verdict
in the Cole Willis manslaughter case.
Do you have a comment on that trial?
Well, Chris, uh, I will in about ten minutes.
For now, all I can say is I think we have to
take a look at police training.
Why is she frowning?
You have her frowning.
Well, this is all new to her.
Give her a second.
No, you prepped her wrong.
You got... I got to go.
Yeah, Eli, I just got off the phone with the mayor.
We're not gonna leave the police exposed.
No one said they'll be exposed.
But they go in with riot gear,
they'll create a riot.
That's what happened in Ferguson.
Okay, but with all due respect to the governor,
we're deferring to the police on this.
No, no, no. You're playing politics
because you want police support in four years.
Okay, and you want
the African-American support, sir.
No one's winning a Nobel Peace Prize here.
No one wins if there's a riot.
Pastor!
Come on, let's not play
dueling pastors here.
Pastor Jeremiah,
I believe you know the mayor's chief of staff.
Yes, I do. Good evening.
Good evening.
She believes the police
should be ready with riot gear and tear gas.
Uh, that would be a terrible mistake.
I mean, the people want to see justice done,
but they will protest peaceably
unless they are provoked.
Franny?
The mayor goes in like storm troopers,
he'll be blamed.
That attitude is contagious.
It diffuses a situation.
And it's all cyclical.
How's she doing?
I can't tell.
There's some bad body language there.
Take a look at police training.
And your time is up, Mr. Prady.
Lightning round.
Do you believe the police were at fault
in Ferguson, Mrs. Florrick?
Well, I'm not sure...
Actually, it's the lightning round.
You only have five seconds.
It's complicated.
Mr. Prady?
It's a systemic problem.
Good. Next question. Talk to us about
race relations in Chicago, Mrs. Florrick.
You've got 45 seconds.
Hi. It's, uh, a work in progress.
You found out something about Evan?
He's working with David Lee?
No.
Then why is he caving?
His son was undergoing surgery to remove histiocytosis tumors
at the Lurie Children's Hospital today.
Did you know that?
No.
The operation was successful.
He just found out an hour ago.
Well, I'm glad.
But...
Yes, it was just before
he made the $30 million settlement offer.
He's become nice.
Uh-oh. We should send him home.
No.
We could open ourselves to a malpractice suit
from Neil Gross.
Then, we step in.
Yes.
Supply the backbone. Kalinda, did you
do any background work on Mrs. Gross
before their marriage?
Yes.
And afterwards.
Freelance work for David Lee?
Yes.
He wanted to see if she was cheating on him.
Is there anything interesting there?
Yes.
Photos.
Good. Poetic justice.
Using David Lee's work against him.
Mrs. Florrick?
You have ten seconds to respond.
Uh, crime is crime.
Black and white shouldn't matter.
It often does, but that shouldn't prevent
the state's attorney from...
Your time is up.
But why don't you finish that sentence?
...doing my job.
Good. Now, let's turn to our journalists.
First up, Patrick Mancini
from The Middeleton Herald.
Do you have a question?
I do. Thank you.
Mrs. Florrick, your husband has not
always been faithful to you in your marriage.
In 2009 he, in fact, resigned from the office
you're now seeking partly because he was caught
in a sexual scandal...
I'm gonna interrupt you right there, Mr. Mancini.
Actually, I'm not finished, ma'am.
Yes. But you already called my campaign manager
with your question, so I'm going
to save you the trouble.
Oh, my God.
What is she doing?
You have photos
of my husband supposedly at the apartment of his legal counsel--
is that correct?
I wish you'd just let me answer my question,
Mrs. Florrick... I mean, ask my question,
Mrs. Florrick...
My daughter is in the audience tonight, sir,
and I would like to do her the favor
of addressing your question, not answering it.
Holy...
Ow, stop!
This is how I would answer your question,
Mr. Mancini.
How dare you, sir?
Do you have a personal life?
Do you have a spouse?
Do you know what it would be like
to have your personal life spilled
across the stage like this?
Broadcasted
into the homes of your friends, your workmates,
your daughter's friends at school?
Do you know what that would be like?
Ma'am, I'm only reporting...
It would be one thing if my job
had anything to do with my husband's infidelity.
I'm not even sure what job that would be.
But your question would at least then be pertinent.
But I'm running for state's attorney.
I am running to be someone to put
a dent in crime in this town.
What does that have to do with my married life?
That was terrific.
Uh-oh. She's brought her own pastor.
All right, I'll deal with that.
Why don't you make sure the police don't overreact?
Because it's the only story...
This is gonna be fine.
Gonna be fine.
Actually, Mrs. Florrick...
I know that I am past my time.
But let me just finish up.
We are real people up here.
Mr. Prady and myself.
We're not cartoons.
When you hurt us, we actually do bleed.
I know that that is hard for you to remember,
Mr. Mancini, but it is worth trying.
If not for me, then for my daughter.
I, um... Yes, thank you. Mr. Prady?
Do you have a response?
I never finished my question.
Sure, if you want to finish your question.
I'm breaking a story tomorrow
about the governor sleeping with his legal counsel.
I didn't create the story.
I'm just reporting on it.
Why don't I turn to Frank Prady?
Uh, 15 seconds.
Do you have a rebuttal?
Uh, I don't have a rebuttal, no.
But I, uh, I will say this.
I think Mrs. Florrick deserves an apology
from the press.
Ah, my own handiwork.
What are you talking about?
David had you followed when he was representing your spouse.
That's why your prenup is void.
Isn't that right, Evan?
Yes, it is.
David, $15 million is as high as we go.
No. I'll keep these.
We have the originals, David.
Good. Keep them.
These are good enough for TMZ.
Not that I'll give it to them.
I'm not sure you're getting this, David--
your client broke her vows.
Yes.
By sleeping with Mr. Gross' biggest competitor.
That'll look good for you,
won't it, Mr. Gross?
Your wife prefers SleuthWay over Chumhum?
Amazing.
Just amazing.
Half my life is about lawyers these days,
and just when I think I have reached bottom,
the ninth circle of hell,
there is always a circle lower.
After he calms down,
tell him we'll settle for $100 million.
You have three hours or we're out of here.
Governor Florrick.
Pastor.
Hello, Father.
Son.
Mr. Governor, Pastor Isaiah believes
the mayor's plan
is the best way to handle any possible violence.
Really?
Is that what you believe?
I just know about a deal between you
and my father.
What deal?
An $80,000 religious study?
And I think it will be evident to those upset by the verdict
that they're being misled.
Why do you hate me so much, son?
I don't hate you, Father.
I just believe you're being misled by politics.
It's your mother, isn't it? She put you up to this.
Okay, the mayor's plan has been implemented, Mr. Governor.
He asks that you assist in his efforts
by not withholding the National Guard reserves.
Well, this isn't good.
The verdict is in.
Oh, crap.
I'm calling the mayor. Get out the National Guard.
Franny, if the mayor goes in with this warrior stance,
there's going to be violence.
Mr. Prady?
The point is, drug arrests have been on the rise
for years now and the sentencing guidelines are crazily wrong.
I'm sorry. Time's up, Mr. Prady.
Mrs. Florrick, you have ten seconds for a rebuttal.
Yes, well, talking about guidelines,
if there were guidelines that we...
I'm sorry again. One second.
Excuse me.
Our live feed has been interrupted.
Uh, what the hell?
Damn it. She was just getting into a rhythm.
We're being asked to take a pause here.
The Cole Willis verdict is in.
And we're switching over to live coverage.
Uh, the hope is that in one or two hours,
they'll switch back to the debate.
Stay tuned.
Great job. You're kicking ass.
Way to neutralize the sex stuff.
Do you want some water?
No, where's the food?
I'm starving.
In the hotel kitchen.
You want me to make you a plate?
You're doing great, Mom.
The verdict is in, and the two police officers
who killed suspected gang member Cole Willis
during a routine arrest were found innocent of all charges.
Suspected gang member.
Really? The suburban father of two?
Okay, let's not get upset.
Why? You afraid I'm gonna riot?
Nora.
This is your Giuliani moment, sir.
Careers are built on moments like...
Eli.
I'm not saying you take advantage of it,
but no one will talk about Ramona
if you handle this properly.
Eli, you need to stop.
Oh, good, I'm starved.
Did they tell you not to eat, too?
Yes.
So, how do you think it's going?
I don't know.
Every time I get started, they say, "Time's up."
You had a good answer to that one reporter.
You were good with the racial question.
It's all artificial, isn't it?
We agree on more than we don't.
We should debate now.
See if we disagree on anything.
Our handlers won't be happy.
Okay, you start.
It helps no one to throw the baby out
with the bath water.
The system need to be tweaked, not overhauled.
You really believe that?
I do.
We're on the verge of another Ferguson...
No, no, no, that was just about jury selection.
The prosecution screwed up on voir dire.
That's why those two cops were found not guilty.
No, they were found not guilty because the system
is inherently racist. Ask anyone.
So what do you do then? If the system is racist,
what is the state's attorney supposed...? You start with hiring.
The racial diversity in the office is a joke.
How many white prosecutors...
No, but the exact opposite needs to be done.
It needs to be a pure meritocracy.
No cronyism.
To consider race?
That's not cronyism.
Yes, it is.
We need good prosecutors.
There are a dozen defense attorneys I know
making $400,000 a year
that would jump at the chance to put criminals away.
They're sick of what they're doing now and...
W-Why don't they?
What?
You said they'd jump
at the chance to be a prosecutor.
Well, what's stopping them?
Well, what's stopping them
is that the office is poorly run.
They know they're gonna spend half their time
dealing with a stupid bureaucracy.
No, no, they don't jump
because it's easier to talk
about doing good than it is to actually do good.
And you call me cynical?
Chicago is on the verge of another Ferguson,
because the system is all white.
Because African-Americans don't see someone
who shares their experience.
You know what's really stupid?
You're two white people arguing
about why black people are rioting.
That's what's stupid.
And you're saying there needs to be more black people in office,
and that's why we need two more white people running.
Okay.
So what do you do?
Stop prosecuting so many drug crimes.
That's exactly my plan for office.
Exactly!
That's why you should vote for me.
They put a guy in prison
for killing a dog just last week.
Then these two cops kill a black man,
and what happens?
They go free?
We should go there.
Now.
What?
Pastor Isaiah, would you like to come with me?
Where you going?
There. ...to express their outrage
over the innocent verdict...
Are you serious?
Yes.
Yes, let's go.
...where hundreds of people protesting
法院前 市中心
the Cole Willis verdict have begun gathering
outside the city courthouse.
I'm gonna have trouble getting home tonight.
You might as well start home now.
You want these photos on TMZ?
We do.
I don't bluff, Diane. You know I don't.
I don't, either.
What's this?
Deena's employment contract as in-house counsel
at Chumhum.
Evan, what's going on?
There's a standard non-compete clause
in the contracts.
Oh, come on.
Deena was sleeping with the CEO of Chumhum's
greatest competitor during the time of that contract.
If you ask me, that violates her non-compete.
That opens her up to a suit.
God, you guys are terrible.
Evan, do you agree
with these kind of tactics?
I'm sorry, David.
Yes, we're all sorry.
$15 million.
You have an hour to accept or it goes away.
My law partner, Cary Agos,
was prosecuted on trumped-up drug charges,
so I understand this issue.
Yeah, and he had all the advantages
of a white entitled businessman.
He's a lawyer, he knew lawyers,
and he knew how to work the system,
but you take any African-American up
on drug charges...
Alicia. Here you are.
Why don't we head back to the greenroom?
No, I'll meet you there.
No, I think we should go together.
Hey, let them talk.
She said she'd see you later. So what?
You would just stop prosecuting all drug crime?
No, nonviolent drug crimes.
I would de-emphasize them.
You can just do that?
I can,
but I'm not sure Alicia can.
Why is that?
Politics.
I believe she'd want
to de-emphasize drug crimes,
but her critics would suggest
she was doing this as a favor to her old client,
Lemond Bishop,
a top drug dealer.
And they would be wrong.
Which wouldn't matter.
The politics would work against her
relaxing drug prosecutions.
But I don't have any history here.
I am free and clear to act.
Okay, folks, I think we're done here.
Why would you want to stop prosecuting drug crimes?
I can barely walk home at night
with all the dealers on my street.
'Cause it's mostly putting blacks in prison.
Yeah, well, maybe they should be in prison.
Excuse me, why is this all about black people?
Most of the trouble I have in my neighborhood
is because of the blacks.
Okay, wait, wait, what?
I'm just telling you what happens in my neighborhood.
No, you're spouting racist bull.
That's not what I'm doing.
Actually, you know what, man?
there's no taping in here.
Uh, it's a proprietary issue with the hotel.
How have you been, Pastor?
I'm well.
I see that you have been, too.
I have.
It's been a while.
It has.
How are you and Alicia?
Fine.
No.
No, you haven't been.
Well, life's...
complicated.
It is.
Still believe?
Do I believe in God?
At times.
You still pray?
No.
Do you want me to pray for you?
I don't know what I'd have you pray for.
That you be a good man.
Do you want to be good?
I think it's a little late for that.
I want to be...
effective.
Does one discount the other?
It can.
Tonight, for example...
I need to be effective.
Pray for that.
Okay, then what do you do?
You talk about equality,
you talk about overcoming racism.
Because that's the point.
No, that's the poetry.
That makes people feel good when you say it,
but that is not the S.A.'s job,
and it wouldn't make a bit of a difference.
That's cynicism talking.
No, that's a defense attorney talking,
saying that I have seen firsthand what prosecutors do wrong.
And I know how to correct it.
That's why I'll be better at it than you.
You're not...
Because I'm not trying
to remake the world.
I don't think I can change people.
I think I can change the office.
You know what, go ahead and shoot whatever you want.
I can put defense attorneys in office
who are hungry to put criminals away.
I can go after the top crooks because I know who they are.
Because you represented them.
Yes!
And I know how they work.
I'm not going in, hoping for pie in the sky.
We've had enough pretty words.
We've had enough of novices who talk a good game
but then throw their hands up when they realize
they can't stop racism.
They can't make everyone good.
That's why people should vote for me and not you.
Frank!
Let's go.
Now. You're eight points up.
Don't squander it.
Oh. We can get a photo.
Ready? One, two, three.
How many people died of Ebola in America? One.
A black man who did everything he was supposed to do.
He went to the hospital. What did they do?
They sent him home with some aspirin.
Everybody white got cured.
Just the black guy they sent home with some pills.
Let's go.
George, how are you?
So you lucked out, Eli.
What are you talking about?
The governor is sleeping with his lawyer,
and what's the headline? A race riot?
How dare you, George?
The governor is facing one of the biggest challenges of his life.
Am I quoting you now?
No, just background.
And you're obsessing about some stupid, unsubstantiated sideshow?
Okay, okay, so what do you want me to quote?
Well, the governor is pulling up right now. I want you to...
to look over there
and I will bring the governor to you.
Why? What's going on?
Do you want access, George?
Then go over there.
What are you doing here?
Are you insane?
The governor asked for me.
Have you seen the news?
No one's reporting it.
Because I've been killing myself
trying to keep it out of the news. If they see you here...
It's my job, Eli.
The governor wants to discuss the legal implications of
closing down the nearest cell tower.
No, no, there are so many things wrong with that sentence.
Just go home.
Hey, Ramona.
You got a minute?
Peter, no, you can't be seen with her.
That'll bring Ramona back into the news.
Just need ten minutes, that's all.
Can you give me ten minutes, Pastor?
Sure, Peter, take the time you need.
Ramona, I have a question for you.
Dear God.
Are you all right, Eli?
No.
I'm not.
I just realize that I work very hard,
and I am not appreciated.
You want to talk about it?
Okay, we're back in about ten minutes.
What's going on out there?
Any violence?
Some sporadic. Nothing cohesive yet.
Yeah, nothing visual.
The news is getting bored.
That's why they're cutting back to the debate.
You'll get more samplers than usual,
so keep up the pressure.
Yeah, and although it was unorthodox,
your extracurricular debate with Prady
has got his people really scared.
Yeah, so just keep up the pressure.
Yeah, I'm thinking of voting for you now.
That's how good you were.
Great.
I need to talk to Jon alone for a minute.
You weren't gonna vote for her before?
No, I'm not a big voter.
I'm in my 20s.
Alicia, I'm not sure it's such a good idea...
Wait. Listen.
It didn't mean anything.
What?
In the parking garage?
I was in a mood.
It didn't mean anything.
Jon, you can look at me.
It's fine. It's fine, really.
It just surprised me is all.
It's a version of transference.
You know, sometimes candidates or their wives,
they, uh, they develop feelings of affection for their handlers.
It's not...
Okay, let's not do that.
Okay.
You don't need to instruct me about my feelings.
Sorry.
That's how I deal with things.
It's, uh, it's whatever.
You still can't look at me, can you?
Look at me.
I don't have feelings for you.
We're good.
It just... happened.
I...
What?
We've got a problem.
What's-what's wrong?
We're calling the debate off tonight.
Really? Why?
Frank Prady. He wants to delay.
Did he say why?
Tonight is not a night for political posturing
and 30-second canned responses to questions
about racial stratification.
Tonight is a night for action.
By action, you mean running away?
That is why I am asking my opponent to join me
in taking to the streets.
Now is the time to listen.
So, is it the time to listen or the time for action?
Jackass, get your story straight.
This is perfect; he just made a mistake.
Okay, here's what we're gonna do.
You're gonna get out there...
Get out where?
At your podium, and you're gonna tell the reporters
you're ready to debate.
We get a photo with you standing at your podium facing no one.
"I paid for this mic."
Here's the thing, Alicia.
This is the turning point of the campaign.
They just made a mistake.
Yeah, that's something Americans understand. Cowardice.
The dog ate my... uh, blah-blah.
You ready? Can you do it?
Let's go.
No, I'm coming there now.
It's an irritant.
We can handle it.
Okay.
What happened, Neil?
Deena used her knowledge with the Chumhum board.
Knowledge of what?
The Fappening.
What? What is that?
It's naked photos of celebrities hacked online.
Yes, my ex-wife called the board
and accuses me of not doing enough to stop the hacking.
Leaves us open to a suit.
In what way "Open"?
Yeah, well, here's the thing.
You're fired.
I'm sorry, what?
You're fired.
You needed to close this down immediately.
You didn't.
Now I have to settle for $75 million.
You cost me $60 million.
I'm done.
Mr. Gross, no other firm could've done anything else.
You know what, Cary, save it.
Your attorney screwed up.
David Lee took advantage of you.
That is why I'm stuck where I am.
I don't like losing $60 million.
I especially don't like losing it
to a wife who cheated on me.
You need to get your act together.
That was unfortunate.
It was.
You know what we need to do.
I think I do.
Well, hello.
You want to offer me more than $100 million?
No.
We know you're not happy with Canning.
He's sick, and you've been carrying all the weight.
Well, well.
Kalinda's really been working overtime for you.
We want you back, David.
I guess you just can't quit me, can you?
What do you want, David?
We get no justice, you get no peace.
We get no justice, you get no peace.
We get no justice, you get no peace.
Eli, we need to talk now.
Yeah, I know.
...you get no peace.
We get no justice,
you get no peace. Black lives matter!
Black lives matter!
Black lives matter!
Black lives matter! Black lives matter!
Black lives matter!
Black lives matter!
Black lives matter!
Black lives matter!
Ramona, I need you to not talk to anyone.
I know how it works, Eli.
What happened?
He said good-bye.
So that's it.
Good-bye.
Good-bye, Ramona.
Black lives matter!
Did you have any luck, Pastor?
She's here.
Black lives matter! Black lives matter!
It's good to meet you, Deidre.
I'm sorry about the death of your husband.
Thank you.
I think we all want the same thing.
We get no justice, you get no peace!
The mayor's on his way from the airport.
Good. Good for him.
Eli, he's asking that you hold
the press conference for 20 minutes.
Franny, this is not a press conference.
This is an urgent need to stop a riot.
No, it's not. No one's rioting.
You're trying to take advantage...
Seriously.
The governor is stepping in for an absentee mayor
in the city's time of need.
You don't want to make an enemy.
No, you don't.
Cole! Cole! Cole!
Cole! Cole! Cole!
Cole! Cole! Cole! Cole!
Cole! Cole! Cole!
Cole! Cole! Cole! Cole!
Cole! Cole! Cole!
Cole! Cole! Cole! Cole!
Cole! Cole! Cole!
Cole! Cole! Cole! Cole!
Cole! Cole! Cole!
Thank you.
I'm sorry that we have to meet under such circumstances,
but I wanted you to hear
from the person who should be the angriest at tonight's events.
Deidre.
Cole was a good man.
If he were here right now,
he'd be saying what I'm saying to you now.
This is not the time to break things.
This is the time to fix them.
Tonight,
we are not black or white,
rich or poor...
That is Governor Florrick
speaking from the Cook County Courthouse steps
on an extraordinary night
of protests and outrage.
It's odd as we're looking at these images of protesting downtown.
You go about your life, not even thinking
about the injustices suffered by others.
And that's part of the problem.
But tonight we all...
Hello?
I like what you've done with it.
What's up, David?
I like this office.
It gets the morning light.
I'm glad.
What are you doing here?
I've come home, Alicia.
We're partners again.
Isn't that great?
Did what we had to do,
and we're gonna keep doing it...
What happened?
Oh, Alicia.
How did the debate go?
We're not sure; we think good.
What's going on?
David Lee was just in my office,
saying he's coming back.
Yes, we're replacing Evan.
As of when?
An hour ago.
Are you serious?
You...
when did you decide this?
An hour ago.
But you can't just...
Don't you think it was important to talk to me?
Well, we tried calling you, but we had to decide right away.
I'm a name partner.
This is a decision for all of us.
No, it isn't,
Alicia, not anymore.
Your running for state's attorney--
that was a decision for all of us.
I told you two...
That it was about Castro.
It was about Cary being prosecuted by him.
Well, Castro's not in the race anymore,
so why are you still in?
I have 90 volunteers working for me,
five paid consultants,
small donations from 38,000 people,
all trying to help me win.
And you're asking why am I still in?
Look, let's just take...
No! If I were a man...
Oh, come on. You never would've...
This is about two people trying to run a law firm.
This has nothing to do with sexism.
Like hell it doesn't.
I want to win.
I want to beat my opponent.
You wouldn't even blink if a man had said that.
Why am I still in?
Because I think I would make a better state's attorney.
There.
You have a problem with that?
Okay, we need to ready
a statement for tomorrow's Sun-Times,
and I need you to get on the phone
with Michael Sneed in five minutes.
What's wrong?
Nothing. Everything's great.
I'm gonna win.
Yes, you are.
Uh, but we've got to keep the momentum going.
Prady took a hit tonight, but we've got to close the deal.
So, uh, Michael Sneed is a great lady.
I've known her for a long time.
She's not gonna come at you with anything crazy.
She's gonna talk about family,
uh, why you got into law in the first place...
