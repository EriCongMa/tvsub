hey , how are things going with your parents ?
not great . they hired divorce attorneys .
you know , speaking of attorneys ,
if i ever needed a lawyer ,
i would not hire she @-@ hulk .
常为超级英雄们打官司
you know what ? that was almost on topic .
i &apos;m gonna say , &quot; good job , sheldon . &quot;
wait , she @-@ hulk &apos;s a lawyer ?
yeah , she works at a law firm in new york .
yes , but she &apos;s the only monster at the firm .
between you , me and the wall ,
i think she &apos;s an affirmative action hire .
在就业 教育等方面给予优待而达到平等的措施
anyway , dad &apos;s gonna be here in town ,
so i won &apos;t be able to do christmas dinner this year .
if you &apos;re not up to hosting christmas dinner ,
i &apos;m happy to do it .
you can even bring your father .
that would be nice .
i &apos;ve always wanted to do a traditional victorian christmas .
parlor games , goose and figgy pudding ...
圣诞烤鹅与广式脆皮烧鹅类似
english pudding .
而不是美式的偏果冻状布丁
y @-@ you get yourself all excited for pudding ,
and here comes a cake with raisins in it .
i &apos;m not going .
you &apos;re going .
why do you hate me ?
i don &apos;t hate you .
i love you .
well , you call it love ,
but it has a lot of raisins in it .
amy , good luck getting these guys excited
about a dinner with a theme .
i gave up when no one cared about my tom hanks @-@ giving .
i think a victorian christmas sounds nice .
i agree .
me , too .
you guys suck !
you know the best part of working in the clean room ?
no allergies .
check it out .
oh , that @-@ that ... that &apos;s a lot of oxygen .
we should get going to amy &apos;s .
can you believe there was a time
when we would have needed an array
of giant cherenkov telescopes to detect cosmic particles ?
and here we are building our own multi @-@ wire detector
like a couple of badasses .
i know . if we were still single ,
we &apos;d be tripping over all that booty .
ladies do love a man dressed like a kitchen garbage bag .
oh , no .
how the hell did a pigeon get in here ?
you shut the loading doors , right ?
i thought you did .
do you know what a disaster this is ? !
you mean &apos; cause this room isn &apos;t supposed to have dust in it ,
and we just let in a flying crap machine ? !
what do we do ? should we call someone ?
and tell them that we compromised all the equipment ?
let &apos;s just get it out of here before anyone knows .
okay , how do we catch it ?
well , what if we turn off all the lights
except for one , and it &apos;ll come to it .
it &apos;s not a moth !
don &apos;t yell at me .
you &apos;re not gonna get any good ideas out of me if you &apos;re yelling .
okay , so if i remain calm ,
i &apos;ll get more gems like , &quot; turn off the lights &quot; ? !
great , we &apos;re turning on each other .
that &apos;s just what the bird wants us to do !
so , dr. koothrappali , long flight ?
20 hours .
oh , that &apos;s rough .
not at all .
did you know that when you fly transcontinental without your wife ,
you don &apos;t pray for the plane to crash ?
can you please talk about anything else ?
forgive me .
how are you and leonard ?
oh , great . everything &apos;s good .
i see you got engaged .
yes , we did .
let me tell you a story .
dad !
sorry .
i &apos;m sure you won &apos;t grow to hate each other .
hey , leonard . what &apos;s up ?
what ? how did that happen ?
yeah , okay . i &apos;ll be there as soon as i can .
sorry . i have to run to the university .
what &apos;s going on ?
there &apos;s been a problem with our experiment .
a bird got into the clean room .
you want me to come ?
uh , no . you had a long flight .
you stay here and relax .
&quot; relax . &quot; easy for you to say .
your mother isn &apos;t cleaning out your bank account .
40 years , the woman never cleaned a thing .
you &apos;re just gonna leave him here ?
&quot; relax , &quot; he says .
yup . bye .
* here comes santa claus , here comes santa claus *
* right down santa claus lane *
跳舞 欢腾 凶婆娘 雷 闪电 丘比特 彗星
* vixen and blitzen and all his reindeer *
* pulling on the reins ... *
yeah , i appreciate the ride ...
* bells are ringing , children singing *
* all is merry and bright *
* so hang your stockings and say your prayers *
&apos;cause santa claus is coming tonight ...
why &apos;d you turn it off ?
because in the last ten minutes , santa came to town ,
kissed mommy
and ran grandma over with a reindeer .
i had a drunk uncle who did all those things .
nobody sings songs about him .
maybe you &apos;d like it more if you thought of santa as a superhero
and his power is bringing joy to children .
my uncle was accused of that , too .
it turned out to be legal in oklahoma .
okay , new subject .
let &apos;s talk about presents .
what did you get amy ?
oh , we &apos;re not exchanging gifts .
come on , sheldon , you have to get her something .
why should i ?
she knows that i don &apos;t like christmas ,
and yet , every year , she forces me to celebrate it .
not only am i going to this foolish dinner against my will .
at the christmas tree lot , there was mistletoe ,
and she kissed me under it in public .
like we were the stars of a tijuana sex show .
she &apos;s just excited about the holidays .
yes , and she &apos;s not taking my feelings into account at all .
maybe it &apos;s time i teach her a lesson .
how ?
it &apos;d have to be something heinous ,
something that makes her as miserable as she &apos;s making me .
oh , i &apos;ve got it .
this is good .
what ?
i &apos;m going to buy her a present .
yeah , you &apos;re gonna have to walk me through that .
with gift @-@ giving , there &apos;s an implied social contract .
if i show up tonight with a present ,
and she doesn &apos;t have one for me ,
she &apos;ll feel terrible .
then you &apos;re both sad ?
yes .
maybe she &apos;ll feel so guilty ,
she &apos;ll never make me celebrate the holidays again .
so your evil plot here is to buy your girlfriend a present ?
that &apos;s right .
so stay on my good side , or i &apos;ll get you a little something , too .
okay , here &apos;s the plan .
i &apos;m gonna put the food in the bag ,
and when he lands in the bag to eat it , we close it up .
a slim jim ?
it &apos;s all i could find . it &apos;ll work .
sure .
if the pigeon &apos;s stoned or a trucker .
okay , well , what &apos;s your plan ?
i told you my plan .
let &apos;s call building services and get help .
and admit that we contaminated the clean room ?
no , admit that you contaminated the clean room .
why do you keep assuming it was me ?
because you do this kind of thing all the time ,
and then you try to cover it up .
like when ?
what about when you flipped the mars rover ,
or lost koothrappali &apos;s dog ,
or almost drove off with that baby ?
again , it looked like my car , and the baby didn &apos;t even cry
until his mother punched me with her keys .
fine , put the slim jim in the garbage bag .
well , what if you said it without sounding so condescending ?
i can try , but your plan has the words
&quot; garbage bag &quot; and &quot; slim jim &quot; in it !
hey , what &apos;s going on ?
genius here wants to catch a bird
with a garbage bag and a slim jim .
should have put it in the bag first .
so , if you don &apos;t mind me asking ,
do you think you might start dating again ?
it &apos;s much too soon for that .
why ? do you know someone ?
no , but if things don &apos;t work out with me and leonard ,
i &apos;ll give you a call .
wait . how much do you talk about star trek ?
okay , let &apos;s get this victorian party started .
i &apos;ve done some research
about some traditional parlor games we can play .
like what ?
well , there &apos;s a fun one called ball of wool .
you take a ball of wool ,
and you put it right in the center of the table .
then people sit on opposite sides of the table
and try to blow the wool off .
sorry . she &apos;s taken , too .
you know what i think your problem is ?
you &apos;re jealous
because you and i used to be best friends
until koothrappali came along .
and you found somebody you could push around ?
stay out of this .
okay .
you know , maybe i &apos;m best friends with raj
because he doesn &apos;t think he &apos;s smarter than me .
actually ...
i said , stay out of it !
n @-@ no . no , raj , go ahead , say what you were gonna say .
all i &apos;m gonna say is
you guys need to stop this right now .
it @-@ it &apos;s bad enough that my parents are fighting ,
now i have to hear the two of you ?
and who cares who &apos;s smarter ?
if it &apos;s leonard or me or ...
you know , it &apos;s christmas , let &apos;s say it &apos;s howard .
well , if you &apos;re so smart , you get the bird out .
no , you &apos;re the one who let him in .
how do you know it wasn &apos;t leonard ?
come on .
what about that sweater ?
no , it &apos;s not good enough .
it has to be perfect .
i think the nicest gifts i &apos;ve got from howie
show how well he knows me .
let &apos;s see , what do i know about amy ?
she loves medieval literature ; chaucer &apos;s her favorite .
被公认为中世纪最伟大的英国诗人
and her eyes sparkle when she watches old french movies .
i enjoy how harp music causes her fingers to dance
as if she &apos;s playing along .
wow , you really do love her .
i do .
now , let &apos;s find the kind of gift
that makes her feel small and worthless .
you won !
certainly doesn &apos;t feel like it , does it ?
you know , my wife used to throw theme parties like this all the time .
oh , i guess that &apos;s where raj gets it from .
well , he and his mother
spent a lot of time together when he was young .
i was always working .
hey , you know , raj is dating a doctor who works a lot .
him and his mom have a type .
you g ... y @-@ you got to laugh at that , right ?
no ? all right .
all right , let me see if i &apos;ve got this straight .
a picture of you on my lap
is a way to punish your girlfriend
for making you celebrate christmas ?
correct .
santa thinks dating you may be punishment enough .
there &apos;s an argument for that .
but i want to make sure .
smile .
ho , ho , ho !
okay . on the count of three ,
i &apos;ll shoot the fire extinguisher and get him airborne .
howard , you wave the blanket and guide him towards the exit .
raj , you hold open the curtain so he can fly out .
are you sure a dummy like me can handle something
as complicated as a blanket ?
do you want the fire extinguisher ?
yeah , i do .
great .
here you go .
okay .
one , two , three .
uh , you have to take the pin out .
you miss the blanket now , don &apos;t you ?
on three .
one , two , three .
what did you do ?
it was an accident .
oh , my god . oh , my god .
relax , it wasn &apos;t your fault .
uh , maybe it &apos;s just stunned .
dude , i @-@ it &apos;s not breathing .
oh , no . i killed it .
oh , not again .
what do you mean , not again ?
when i was ten ,
i was playing in my backyard and ...
sat on a blue jay .
i mean , i tried to bring it back to life with electricity ,
but it just ...
caught on fire .
the worst part was it smelled delicious .
uh , guys , i found an article here
that says you can do cpr on birds .
great ! do it !
i &apos;m not doing it . you killed him , you do it .
i &apos;ll do it .
no .
i need to do it .
this is on me .
okay .
&quot; mouth over beak and light chest compressions . &quot;
don &apos;t blow too hard .
if you pop him , i will vomit .
anything ?
i am tasting a lot of slim jim .
wait , wait , his wing moved !
oh , he blinked his eyes ! he &apos;s alive !
it &apos;s a christmas miracle !
i might argue a hanukkah miracle , but i &apos;ll take it .
come on , little guy , let &apos;s get you outside . get the curtain .
someone should really close that loading door .
well , that &apos;s that .
the room &apos;s compromised .
they &apos;ll have to change all the filters ,
probably shut it down for weeks .
you were right . go ahead , call building services .
tell them it was my fault .
no , we &apos;re both to blame .
you know , let me take the heat on this one .
yeah , just leave me out of it .
you know if they come here and see crap everywhere ,
they &apos;re just gonna blame the indian guy .
hey . i &apos;m sorry , we &apos;re still here .
is everything okay ?
it &apos;s kind of boring .
although it did get exciting for a minute
when amy inhaled a wool ball .
how much longer do you think you &apos;ll be ?
i don &apos;t know .
there &apos;s still a bird in here .
we are gonna get in a ton of trouble .
honey , it &apos;s christmas eve .
who even knows you &apos;re in there ?
no , our names are on the sign @-@ in sheet .
so erase them and walk out .
i can &apos;t do that .
can &apos;t do what ?
she says take our names off the sign @-@ in sheet and leave .
we can &apos;t do that .
yeah .
* jingle bells , jingle bells , jingle all the way *
* oh , what fun it is to ride *
* in a one @-@ horse open sleigh , hey ! *
amy , that pudding was delicious .
if you like raisins .
thank you . and it &apos;s figs .
oh , in that case , it was pretty good .
you feeling okay ? you hardly touched your goose .
it smelled too much like blue jay .
can i help you clean up ?
oh , you heimliched a ball of wool out of me ;
you &apos;re good .
uh , what do you say we exchange gifts ?
oh , sheldon , we didn &apos;t bring any .
i thought you hate giving gifts .
yeah , i do .
which is why i got amy this .
you got me something ?
oh , not just something , no .
it &apos;s from the heart , it &apos;s holiday @-@ themed ,
and i swallowed the gift receipt so you cannot return it .
look at you on santa &apos;s lap .
that &apos;s so sweet .
of course it is . it &apos;s the perfect gift .
h @-@ how are you feeling right now ?
guilty ? sad ?
wishing you were jewish ?
no , i love it .
oh , really ?
well , how about now ?
happy holidays to my dear amy .
i hope you treasure this
as much as i treasure you .
and you got me nothing .
christmas is ruined .
let &apos;s never speak of it again .
well , this was fun .
actually ,
i did get you something .
but what about our agreement ?
well , you got me something . here .
cookies ?
they &apos;re your meemaw &apos;s christmas cookies .
i called and got the recipe .
they &apos;re perfect .
it tastes like her hugs .
merry christmas , sheldon .
i can &apos;t believe this .
you &apos;re happy , i &apos;m happy .
well , maybe a holiday that &apos;s all about giving isn &apos;t so ...
get your hand out of that box !
okay .
the next game is called hot boiled beans .
of course it is .
one person is sent out of the room
while the others hide a small item .
then they invite the first person back by saying ,
&quot; hot boiled beans and bacon for supper ,
hurry up before it gets cold . &quot;
if you people think this is better than tom hanks @-@ giving ,
you &apos;re all crazy .
