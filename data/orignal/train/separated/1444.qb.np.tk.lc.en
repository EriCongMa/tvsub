oh , my goodness , those hands are cold .
at least , buy me dinner first .
tell my wife and kids i love them .
oh , my god .
that &apos;s kind of dark , mom .
what
wait , what &apos;s my favourite hospital food ?
jell @-@ o !
hi , buddy .
no , today is so good .
good for what ? who &apos;s buddy ?
yeah , just head over on to the house .
whose house ? who &apos;s buddy ?
ok , see you in a couple .
克莱尔取其本意 &quot; 一对 &quot; &#93;
couple of what ? who &apos;s buddy ?
kenneth .
kenneth ?
kenneth !
if i had a son , i &apos;d want him to be like kenneth ploufe .
you do have a son .
when we first moved in here ,
he was the sweet kid who lived next door .
mm , the weird kid who lived next door ,
but phil always had a soft spot for him
because kenneth sort of looked up to him .
i wouldn &apos;t say hero .
and yet you did .
well , you weren &apos;t going to .
claire &apos;s always had some issues with kenneth .
he would stare at me a little too long .
can you blame him ?
you used to dress sexy back then .
ten years . can you believe it ?
i feel like we ended that last hug too soon .
i-- come on again !
oh , wow , that &apos;s a lot of hugging .
oh ! she &apos;s right . why hug when you can ...
man @-@ shake .
man @-@ shake .
i &apos;m gonna get the coffee .
&quot; man @-@ shake . &quot;
are we sure ?
roll up the curtain .
第三季 第九集
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s worse--
that he competes every thanksgiving in a pie @-@ eating contest ,
or that he &apos;s 9 @-@ time runner @-@ up .
it wouldn &apos;t be thanksgiving without the contest .
yes , it would .
i think i have to tell my pumpkin chunkin story .
oh , no , no , you don &apos;t have to .
no , i kind of think i have to .
once , cam and his friends
tried to slingshot a pumpkin across a football field .
three seconds .
that &apos;s all he needs to tell that story .
so the fog was rolling in over the mountains
like an ominous blanket
as we readied the giant slingshot .
you know , lorna , the pastor &apos;s daughter ,
she was nervous because like i said , it was after curfew .
she was a goody two @-@ shoe .
only pastor &apos;s daughter i ever met that was .
so we finally launch the pumpkin ,
and it sails through the air , goalpost to goalpost ...
past the end zone , into the parking lot ,
through the open roof of lorna &apos;s dad &apos;s car .
i turn to cody and i say ,
&quot; now what are the chances of that landing there ? &quot;
he says , &quot; where ? &quot;
and i say ...
&quot; the sunroof of a preacher man . &quot;
wah @-@ wah
okay , come on in !
voila !
ah ! okay , what are we looking at ?
my centerpiece for thanksgiving .
it is wonderful . you &apos;re so talented .
i can &apos;t believe that you did this .
yeah , my juices were really flowing on this one .
i actually shot a making @-@ of video .
hey , maybe we can watch it later at the party .
well , yeah , that or football .
mi amor , i &apos;m so proud of you .
is there nothing in the world that you can &apos;t do ?
centerpieces , for starters .
why do you say everything of his is great ,
even if it isn &apos;t ?
because i &apos;m building him up .
that &apos;s what parents do .
too much , if you ask me .
kids cross the street nowadays , they get a ribbon .
manny &apos;s got plenty of confidence .
he just needs a little reality check every now and then .
and this thing is a horn of ugly .
shh !
my mother used to criticize everything i did .
and look at me now .
i am a jumble of insecurities .
i &apos;m not getting that .
do not say a word to manny .
fine . but trust me ,
if you told him the truth , he &apos;d thank you later .
mm . like claire and mitch ? did they thank you ?
not yet .
but it &apos;s coming .
ah ! so many memories in this place . yeah .
do you guys still have , like , every cereal ?
we have a lot .
yeah ! of course you do . of course you do .
you only have the greatest dad in the world .
so what have you been up to ?
i haven &apos;t seen you since you went off to college .
oh , you know , actually , that didn &apos;t work out so well .
i bounced around for a while .
ended up washing dishes in new mexico .
so without the benefit of a college degree ,
i guess your options were kind of limited , huh ?
ease up . it &apos;s a holiday .
yeah , it was--it was tough . oh , no. no , thank you .
thank you , though , sweetie . you &apos;re so sweet .
oh . okay .
it was tough for a while ...
but then a roommate and i started our own business .
oh , was that also in the dish or cleaning industry ?
no . no , no , no .
it was actually a small investment company .
well , small at first .
you know , we rode the tech wave for a while ,
then expanded into video games ,
amusement parks , sports arenas .
anything that seemed awesome , really .
i &apos;m actually in town to buy a blimp .
holy crow .
so if you--if you &apos;d gone to college ,
you would have done all that just four years later ,
or--or never .
alex really needs to be picked up ,
sweetie . why don &apos;t you go get her ?
i wanna hear more of what he has to say about
we &apos;re leaving .
kenneth , i am so proud of you .
you really made it .
well , i did get one pretty lucky break .
early on , i met a very special guy
who taught me that what i thought and said had value .
oh , you mean like--
shh . luke . let the man talk .
he encouraged me to always find the fun
and follow this thing .
your lung ?
no , my heart .
to this day , at every crossroad ,
i ask myself one question--
what would phil dunphy do ?
record scratch !
oh , that &apos;s me buzzin &apos; .
oh , it &apos;s paris .
she &apos;s my assistant in tokyo .
you &apos;d think they &apos;d know how to demo 4 @-@ d gaming graphics without my help
they don &apos;t . hey , luke ,
what instrument does yo @-@ yo ma play ?
um ... cello ?
he &apos;s me ...
and he &apos;s spectacular .
oh , my god .
kenneth ploufe is part owner of a resort in the bahamas ,
some cruise line ,
and lacy fair , that lingerie company .
oh ! ew ! i &apos;m wearing one of his bras !
look , he &apos;s got a model in his lap .
no way .
look at her .
this is your fault !
are you seriously gonna stay in here all day ?
i can &apos;t face mom .
if i see her , i &apos;m gonna have to confess .
take a breather . it &apos;s just a dent .
and saying nothing is not lying , okay ?
it &apos;s just letting the truth speak for itself .
this is not the time for moral equivocation .
okay , i don &apos;t know what that means ,
and also , don &apos;t tell me .
you &apos;re the one who &apos;s gonna lose her driving privileges .
i don &apos;t know why you &apos;re so calm .
all we have to do is keep it from mom
until she goes to the store .
then , when she sees it , she &apos;ll assume that it happened there ,
which it did , so it &apos;s not really lying .
listen to you .
are you gonna be a career criminal ?
ugh . you sound like mom .
i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m gonna do after high school .
it was a supportive &quot; wah @-@ wah . &quot;
i was trying to save the moment .
there &apos;s no such thing as a supportive &quot; wah @-@ wah . &quot;
a &quot; wah @-@ wah &quot; by its very nature is vicious and undercutting .
well , i was just trying to salvage that story , okay ?
i told you not to tell it ,
you told it , and it died .
it did not die . it &apos;s a thinker .
cam , the only thing people were thinking was ,
&quot; thank god this story &apos;s over . &quot;
okay . i get it .
so how long have i been embarrassing you with my stories ?
no , no , no , no . you don &apos;t embarrass me .
i love your stories , okay ?
the tractor in the swimming hole ?
aunt betty &apos;s wiglet on the piglet ?
uncle carl said she couldn &apos;t tell &apos; em apart .
see ? those are funny . you have so many great ones .
well , that &apos;s farm life .
rain or shine , there &apos;s always a bumper crop of stories .
yeah , i &apos;m just saying maybe
you take punkin chunkin out of the rotation .
i guess you &apos;re right . maybe i could just--
yeah , stick to the ones that really happened ,
because people love those .
excuse me . what ?
i &apos;m--i &apos;m just saying people laugh more at stories that are true .
punkin chunkin is a true story .
true @-@ ish ?
no . true .
really ?
the length of a football field ,
through the sunroof of a car that was open in late november in missouri ?
it was unseasonably warm .
that explains the fog rolling over the hill .
and who &apos;s cody--
who you &apos;re close enough to chunk with
but mysteriously only appears in this story ?
cody was k.i.a. in desert storm .
he &apos;s a hero .
you know , all this from someone
who &apos;s never even chunked a punkin .
well , i &apos;ve never lunked a tunkin , either .
you know , these aren &apos;t real things .
this &apos;ll work , right ?
totally , dad .
why have one long table
when you can use four little ones bistro style ?
i &apos;ll bet this is how the french do thanksgiving .
you don &apos;t mind sitting with your uncle mitch
and , uh , grandpa , do you ?
anything &apos;s better than watching lily chew .
by the way ,
this is the side of your old man that kenneth was talking about .
original .
imaginative .
fearless .
so kenneth became a gajillionaire
by asking himself , &quot; what would phil do ? &quot;
he sure did .
where did that come from ? right ?
but you &apos;re you .
why aren &apos;t we gojillionaires ?
why don &apos;t you do what phil would do ?
phil , why didn &apos;t you just put the extra leaves in the table ?
trying to have some fun , be creative .
one long table , honey .
if it was good enough for the last supper ,
it &apos;s good enough for us .
i &apos;m having second thoughts about this centerpiece .
ay , no .
hear him out .
i just think if we bring it to phil and claire &apos;s ,
we &apos;ll never see it again , right ?
that &apos;s the plan .
well , that would be sad .
except maybe my sadness will inspire me
to create something even greater .
remember that collage i made
that helped us get through katrina ?
you did this . you know that .
so ...
is this the legendary rice pilaf we &apos;ve been hearing about ?
try for yourself .
used to make it every year ,
but it , uh , started to upstage the turkey .
something wrong ?
not so much wrong as missing .
it--it just tastes a little flat .
that a fact ?
i just think with the earthiness of the rice ,
you might want something zesty to set it off .
i think this might be a job for cumin .
you know , since we &apos;re sharing
helpful criticisms--
no , no , no , no .
nobody &apos;s sharing anything . manny , go change for the party .
no , no , no , but i appreciate helpful criticisms .
it , uh , it &apos;s important for me that i hear the truth .
makes me stronger ,
less of a mama &apos;s boy .
yeah , mom , he can take it .
that &apos;s what he says ,
but you don &apos;t really know what he feels underneath .
some people are so sensitive ,
that they hear one criticism ,
and it kills the spark that made them special .
i think i know what &apos;s going on here .
good .
this is about you and your mom , isn &apos;t it ?
yes , it is .
no , it isn &apos;t .
yes , it is !
manny , don &apos;t upset me anymore .
go . go change .
what--what should i wear ?
ay , you look good in everything !
where you going , mom ?
mm , i gotta run to the store .
someone ate all the marshmallows .
hey , can i tell you something ?
i was thinking that maybe after new year &apos;s break ,
we could visit a couple more colleges .
seriously ?
i was so hard on you before .
i &apos;m sorry . i know i &apos;m no kenneth .
i &apos;m gonna need all the help that i can get .
honey , i am so proud of you . oh .
oh , thank you .
what &apos;s this ?
oh , okay .
what are you doing ?
oh , uncle mitch is picking up the marshmallows .
then again , backpacking through europe
could be educational in its own way .
no ! no , no ! no , no , no !
do you know what &apos;s illegal in europe ?
nothing !
you are going to college !
okay , fine .
darn right it &apos;s fine .
piece of cake .
my hair &apos;s coming out !
wow , honey . i @-@ i think you could make these simpler .
just , you know , sort of do &apos; em flat and on the side .
hmm . yeah . seems like that &apos;s how you like me .
flat and on the side .
you know what ? sometimes i need to be puffed up and frilly .
all right , is this one of
those moments i &apos;m gonna have to remember later
when they ask me if there were any signs ?
this is what phil would do--
make fantastic napkin origami
that startles and delights his guests .
i know , but , sweetie ,
they &apos;re just looking a little ...
claire , you always do this . you squelch me .
you squelch me right when i &apos;m about to soar .
honey , you &apos;re folding napkins .
you &apos;re folding my dreams !
you know what kenneth told me ?
the secret to his success--
his whole career , he &apos;s tried to emulate me .
the only difference is ,
he hasn &apos;t had someone constantly telling him what not to do .
so the only reason we don &apos;t have a @-@ a blimp tethered to our mailbox
is because i &apos;m always shooting down your great ideas ?
yeah .
let &apos;s review the squelch pile , phil .
let &apos;s see-- the rice pudding franchise .
works for all chewing abilities .
adult tricycles .
just try to fall off .
the aspirin gun .
some people have a hard time swallowing !
and you left one out . hmm .
and that , my dear claire , is a real head @-@ scratcher--
&quot; tm . &quot;
action .
hey , friend .
you look like you had a rough day at the office .
the stress from my job at the robot assassin factory ...
is too much to take .
aw , shoot me an aspirin , pal .
maybe someday .
but until then , try this on for size .
the real head @-@ scratcher features 32 patent @-@ pending &quot; nogginizers &quot;
that gently massage your scalp
in a soothing purr of motorized delight .
ahh . it feels great ,
and it looks good , too .
it &apos;s a real lifesaver .
you mean a real head @-@ scratcher ?
&quot; tm . &quot;
i love you , phil ,
but you--
stop .
i love your &quot; i love you . &quot;
i &apos;m getting awful tired of your &quot; but . &quot;
i heard it .
welcome , welcome , welcome !
happy turkey day !
hey , is that a new car ?
yep ! it &apos;s the best , isn &apos;t it ?
i can &apos;t take my eyes off it .
you shouldn &apos;t , either .
are you okay , mami ?
i &apos;m ... i &apos;m ...
hey , guys ! now the party &apos;s started . come on !
how are you ?
good .
you disgust me .
are you hungry ?
oh , good . it &apos;s still in one piece .
you hit those potholes pretty hard .
it &apos;s like you didn &apos;t see &apos; em .
no , i saw &apos; em .
can i be honest with you , jay ?
i &apos;m getting the sense
that you &apos;re not the biggest fan of &quot; allegria &quot; ?
you got a name for it now ? great .
all right . cards on the table ?
this is not your best work .
now look , don &apos;t get me wrong .
you &apos;re a talented kid .
you &apos;re gonna be a big success in the world .
but this ... this is a swing and a miss .
well , but my mom said it was--
it &apos;s great , yeah , i know .
but how did she say it ?
what do you mean ?
there &apos;s a big difference between &quot; it &apos;s great , &quot; and &quot; it &apos;s great . &quot;
you hear that ?
&quot; it &apos;s great , &quot; and &quot; it &apos;s great . &quot;
all i hear is a bunch of people telling me i &apos;m great .
and that &apos;s a problem , because a lot of times
people will lie to you to protect your feelings ,
and that &apos;s not doing you any favors .
you get a lot farther in life
if you know what you &apos;re good at and what you &apos;re not .
now you can handle that , right ?
yeah .
of course you can .
how you doing , honey ?
i &apos;m great .
okay , everybody , come on !
two minutes till dinner ! get ready !
good ! all right !
oh , wow , manny . what have you got there ?
he made a centerpiece !
oh , that &apos;s fantastic .
it &apos;s stunning .
it &apos;s garbage .
no , no , no !
what are you doing ? it &apos;s so beautiful !
stop the lies .
jay told me the truth .
what did you say ?
i mentioned it wasn &apos;t his best effort .
he said it was a swing and a miss .
why ? ! why do you say these things , jay ? !
it &apos;s like i married my mother !
jay , why would you do that ?
because he &apos;s a pritchett .
but don &apos;t let these negative nellies drag you down , manny ,
because one day you could have a trillion @-@ dollar idea
that the people who supposedly love you most--
okay , phil !
that &apos;s it . go get the head @-@ scratcher .
the real head @-@ scratcher , &quot; tm &quot; ?
go get it , and let everybody else decide
how many trillions i &apos;ve cost you .
way ahead of you .
what &apos;s going on here ?
we are about to make hat history .
or as i like to call it , &quot; hatstory . &quot;
early man had hours and hours to scratch his weary head .
but what about today &apos;s busy times ?
thank you , squire .
great thing about this ?
you can wear it anywhere .
hit it , buddy .
oh !
it &apos;s like a thousand tiny angels
are line dancing on my sca--
i ... it looks like we got a slight malfunction in a rear nogginizer .
oh ! shut her down ! shut her down , buddy !
it &apos;s not working !
my hair ! it &apos;s got my hair !
okay ! fine .
that--i &apos;m fine .
forgot about that feature . it &apos;s an exfoliating ... scrub .
buddy , can you grab the safety shears ?
you know what , phil ? keep it up .
and i admire you and manny .
i know what it &apos;s like to stare down skepticism from a loved one .
cam , not now .
why not now ? it &apos;s thanksgiving .
families gather . issues come up .
only if you bring them up .
it &apos;s healthy to get things out in the open .
y &apos;all know my punkin chunkin story ,
or do you need a refresher ?
we &apos;ve heard it .
oh , several times .
i love it .
with cody and the friends ?
yes . so you know how it ends .
but the question is , who here thinks i made that up ?
oh . well , doesn &apos;t that tell the whole story right there ?
here we have the skeptics , the dream @-@ squashers ...
the pritchetts .
and here we have the dreamers , the artists , the visionaries .
sweet caroline !
so we &apos;re supposed to believe that
you make a @-@ a pumpkin fly across a football field .
yeah . i can prove it to you right now .
let &apos;s go to the football field .
yes ! let &apos;s do this . i &apos;d love to end this .
yeah ! let &apos;s settle this !
dreamers versus pritchetts !
bravo ! bravo ! when i say &quot; punkin , &quot; you say &quot; chunkin &quot; !
punkin ! punkin !
no , no , no !
hold it ! i did not just cook for eight hours
so you people could run off to prove some asinine point
that &apos;s only gonna make half of us feel bad !
come on ! show a little respect .
turkey smells great , sweetheart .
is that turkey ?
because something smells like chicken .
okay , let &apos;s settle this .
yeah .
vamos , vamos ! jay , i drive !
when i say &quot; punkin , &quot; you say &quot; chunkin &quot; !
punkin ! chunkin !
this is the coolest thing ever .
okay , i want to film .
ay , no , wait , i want to be in it .
hey , cam , are you sure this is going to work ?
oh , god , you sound just like cody .
do you think this could launch a human ?
luke ...
let &apos;s do the pumpkin first .
okay .
they &apos;re having fun over there ,
but you know it &apos;s gonna end in tears .
yeah , always does .
knock @-@ knock . who &apos;s there ?
physics .
thank you .
mm @-@ hmm .
who &apos;s gonna be able to launch it ?
i think it should be cam !
oh , no ! i think it should be all of us !
all of us ! all of us !
just get right here . whoo !
for the record , i don &apos;t squash all of phil &apos;s dreams .
just the ones that are , you know , potentially fatal .
i &apos;m just trying to get the kid ready for life .
yeah . yes , i @-@ if we didn &apos;t do this to them ,
the world would .
okay , everybody , in final launching positions ?
get ready to eat some crow !
it is not as delicious as it sounds .
okay ...
uno !
dos ! tres ! three !
what happened , cam ?
i don &apos;t know . i @-@ i don &apos;t know .
can we do it again ?
no , we only had one pumpkin ,
and we just chunk it .
well , we were right .
aw , yeah .
i &apos;m sorry , guys .
this usually feels a little better , doesn &apos;t it ?
yeah .
huh ? mm .
all right . i @-@ i hate to admit it ,
but when they put the pumpkin in ,
i was kind of hoping it would work .
yeah .
me , too .
all right ! let the gloating begin .
you know , it was a pretty good try .
we don &apos;t need your pity .
let &apos;s just get this stuff cleaned up .
well--or if--if maybe we , um ...
we launch it from a steeper angle ?
yeah .
then ... maybe if you had somebody else ,
you know , helping you pull the thing .
but we don &apos;t have any more pumpkins .
that &apos;s the easy part !
they &apos;re on every porch up and down the block .
oh , we can handle that . come on , kid !
yeah .
come on . let &apos;s try one .
okay ! all right ! let &apos;s do it !
i say &quot; punkin , &quot; gang says &quot; chunkin &quot; !
there are dreamers and there are realists in this world .
you &apos;d think the dreamers would find the dreamers
and the realists would find the realists ,
but more often than not , the opposite is true .
maybe if this works ,
we should launch my centerpiece next .
it wasn &apos;t that bad .
your rice pilaf was .
jay , be careful !
okay . all right .
oh ! oh ! keep going , keep going ! keep going !
you see , the dreamers need the realists
to keep them from soaring too close to the sun .
and the realists ...
well , without the dreamers ,
they might not ever get off the ground .
okay ! next one &apos;s going through the--the goal thingy ,
i can feel it !
now when lorna , cody , and i did this , it was--
less talkin &apos; , more chunkin .
mom , i need to tell you something .
what is it , honey ?
ready !
i distracted haley while she was driving ,
and we dented your car .
fire !
well , girls ...
three more seconds , and you would have gotten away with it .
now a human ?
come here , lily .
