whoa , whoa . hey , stop it .
there is nothing in there except for rabbits , squirrels .
nothing -- you &apos;re fine .
damn it !
angus , come back here !
angus !
angus ?
here , boy .
angus ?
come on , buddy .
angus , come here , boy .
angus , what &apos;s wrong , buddy ?
oh , my god .
no .
no .
would you get --
no , mom .
en garde .
you do know i carry a gun .
aha !
don &apos;t touch ! don &apos;t .
come on . give me your jacket .
stop it .
hey , you two , knock it off . somebody &apos;s gonna get hurt .
she started it .
well , she can &apos;t go to work with whatever that is all over her .
i was gonna shake it off once i got to the office .
give it here .
ma
come on .
okay , what is that ?
looks like low @-@ grade foam rubber ,
the kind used in inexpensive throw pillows ,
chair cushions , and cheap furniture .
it &apos;s from my couch .
what ? the duct tape came loose .
duct tape ?
yeah . greeks use windex .
rizzolis use duct tape .
it has a hole in it .
do you have anything to eat ?
why does your couch have a hole in it
covered with duct tape ?
and how have i not noticed it ?
because i ... cover it with a pillow .
joe friday did it .
i &apos;m lucky that korsak found her owners
before she ate the entire couch .
don &apos;t blame addie .
it &apos;s not her fault that your couch tastes
like frank and beans .
my couch doesn &apos;t taste like frank --
wait a minute . how do you know that joe friday &apos;s owner
has changed her name to addie ?
i skype with her family .
you skype ... with her family ?
her real name was addie before she got lost .
okay , i think the more important question here is
why haven &apos;t you replaced your couch ?
the dog &apos;s been gone over a year .
i like my couch . what is this ?
your couch has a hole in it
covered with duct tape .
it &apos;s an african horned cucumber .
can you eat it ?
of course .
tastes like a banana .
you need a new one .
do you have one ?
a new couch ?
no . a banana .
i like my couch ...
just the way it is . rizzoli .
isles .
swatches .
i don &apos;t want a couch as a gift , maura .
think of it as a health issue .
the chemicals used to manufacture that cheap ...
easy .
... economical foam rubber
in your couch could pose a health risk .
right now i &apos;m worried about catching malaria .
oh , don &apos;t be .
there hasn &apos;t been an outbreak of locally contracted malaria
since 1931,
although there have been recent outbreaks
of equine encephalitis .
has not one of these mosquitos buzzed your head ?
but -- you really aren &apos;t human , are you ?
well , some people have a genetic susceptibility to being bitten .
i don &apos;t .
nice day for a hike in the woods , huh ?
this -- this is why i don &apos;t go in the woods .
hold out your hands .
you got enough for the whole body ?
i got to bathe in this stuff .
what do we got ?
white female . probably a teenager .
we got a name ?
no backpack . no pocketbook . no i.d.
but her clothes are new , so i don &apos;t think she &apos;s homeless .
this isn &apos;t a body dump .
crate was camouflaged so it would blend in .
no sign of a struggle .
no blood spatter in the immediate area .
and there are no drag marks ,
so she was carried here , but not in the cage .
maybe she was attacked on the walking path ?
no cameras at the entrance points .
we &apos;re checking the ones nearby .
time of death ?
well , there are signs of lividity
but lack of rigor mortis .
i &apos;d say less than five hours ago .
no obvious signs of injury or trauma
that would account for death .
well , that looks like hair and blood .
okay . i &apos;ll do a dna test as soon as i get back .
please find me something that belongs to the killer
so i can put him in a cage of his own .
what &apos;s with the spaceships ?
research for this astronomy course i &apos;m taking .
we had this huge discussion the other night .
let me guess -- ufos and life on other planets .
yes . and get this . this is crazy .
the government declassified
thousands of documents from a secret file
that dates back to 1947 .
there &apos;s firsthand accounts of sightings ...
when i was a kid ...
... even stories of alien abductions
and human testing .
... i saw a ufo .
clearly , they &apos;re delusional .
w--
wait . what did you just say ?
nothing .
well , i @-@ i blurted .
yeah , i blurt sometimes . it &apos;s a problem .
hm . hey , you want to , uh , talk about the case ?
do you have anything on the victim ?
nothing from missing persons or runaways ...
... but these girls came up
on today &apos;s school department truancy report .
let me see the third girl .
did you get the picture of the victim yet ?
i think it just came in .
that &apos;s her .
sheila macintyre , 16 years old , from roslindale .
i &apos;m gonna tell korsak .
he &apos;s gonna want to talk to the parents .
take a look at these .
x @-@ rays ?
fabric swatches ?
oh , just a few options for your new couch color .
my favorite couch color ? huh . let me think .
the lavender .
no , no , no . wait . wait . wait .
the cranberry .
or the color of the couch i have now .
i &apos;m trying to be a good friend .
yes , i know .
but my couch is like an old , good friend ,
and i wouldn &apos;t trade an old , good friend
for a ... new , old , good friend .
okay , you have a birthday coming up .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to just get something you really want ?
i really want a cause of death .
what ? what are you looking at ?
osteopenia .
it &apos;s a loss of calcium in the bones .
well , she &apos;s a little young for that , isn &apos;t she ?
in a person of her age ,
it typically results from anorexia .
well , that &apos;s not what killed her .
no , it didn &apos;t .
but i also found this ...
a puncture wound from a small @-@ gauge needle .
so she was injected with a fatal overdose .
well , given the lack of restraint marks or bruising ,
i &apos;d say we &apos;re looking at a fast @-@ acting drug
that could be administered intramuscularly .
so , she was drugged , carried back to the cage .
there &apos;s no indication of rape or other sexual assault .
what about the hair and blood
that we found inside the cage ?
it was animal blood .
we &apos;re processing it for dna now .
the hair fibers , however ,
came from a raccoon , a dog , and a squirrel .
is there any way to tell what order they went into the cage ?
several samples overlapped .
i think the squirrel came first , then the raccoon .
the dog was last .
a bigger animal each time .
he was practicing ... getting ready for a human .
how the hell do you get through a day like this ?
right now they &apos;re on autopilot .
the worst day is coming -- the day the shock wears off
and they know their little girl is really gone .
what did you learn from sheila &apos;s school ?
well , the guidance counselor says sheila
was an all @-@ around good kid --
top of her class academically , no disciplinary issues .
she was a mentor to the incoming freshmen
and a peer counselor for the younger girls .
maura found evidence of anorexia .
mom and pop said she was treated for it
starting in her freshman year .
and it sounds like she was paying it forward .
what about boyfriend issues ?
from what the guidance counselor told me ,
these kids don &apos;t really date .
they do things as a group , kind of all hang out together .
you believe that ?
i do .
well , maybe one of them
knows about sheila &apos;s movements that morning .
two girlfriends walked with her as far as the bus stop .
then they got on the 40 bus to forest hills ,
and sheila took her usual route
along the walking path to her school .
so now we know why she was in the woods .
doesn &apos;t explain what she was doing in a damn cage .
well , nina submitted the case to vicap
for crimes with similar m.o.s.
maybe we &apos;ll get lucky .
you look exhausted . why don &apos;t you go home and rest ?
can &apos;t .
not until i find something ,
anything , that will move this case forward .
well , i have a preliminary tox screen .
for real ?
negative for heroin , cocaine , and marijuana .
great .
that leaves only 7 million other drugs
that could have been given to her .
on the bright side ,
the full report should be ready tomorrow .
okay .
don &apos;t you just love this color ?
yes .
i love it .
it looks fantastic ...
on you ...
not a couch .
well , i love it .
your text said you had some info
on the company who made the cage ?
galen containment vessels .
they manufacture a wide range of animal cages ...
from mice and rats to larger wildlife --
wolves , coyotes , dogs , primates .
they supply over two dozen vendors ...
who , in turn , sell them to laboratories ,
game wardens , and , believe it or not ,
pig farmers .
you know , i @-@ i don &apos;t believe in any of that stuff .
pig farming ?
no .
not pig farming . i don &apos;t care about pig farming .
i &apos;m talking about ufos .
i @-@ i don &apos;t believe in it or care about it .
you know ... i was just a kid .
it &apos;s stupid .
really ?
yeah .
i mean , it was my imagination .
it was probably a blimp or a frisbee or ...
all right , let me know when the list of vendors comes up .
but they &apos;re right ... over there .
she &apos;s right in here .
oh , thank you .
maura .
kevin foley .
please come in .
thank you .
hello .
hi .
i @-@ i &apos;m -- i &apos;m sorry to drop in without calling .
not at all . it &apos;s really nice to see you .
i was just making some coffee . would you like to join me ?
oh , uh , no , no , uh ...
uh , thank you .
please .
chief medical examiner .
so ... interdisciplinary .
i could never do what you do .
oh . you &apos;ve always been very modest .
i read the journal of clinical psychiatry ,
and your innovations and applications
on narrative therapy are very impressive .
thank you .
so , what brings you by ?
i was reading the boston dispatch .
i @-@ i know it &apos;s available online ,
uh , but i just can &apos;t let go of the physical paper .
oh , i know how you feel .
th @-@ there was a , um --
a photo of you at the scene of a murder .
kevin ?
the photo -- it -- it -- it made me , um ...
i wanted to ...
well , i wanted to ask you --
oh , that poor girl .
she wasn &apos;t assaulted in any way , was she ?
i can &apos;t discuss an open investigation with you .
yes , of course . of course not .
c @-@ could you tell me if , um ...
do you have a suspect ?
why do you want to know ?
kevin , if you know anything --
i &apos;ve made a terrible mistake by coming here like this .
i -- - no , not at all .
i @-@ i can &apos;t do this .
i &apos;m sorry .
i @-@ i @-@ it was lovely to -- to see you , maura .
okay , maura , thanks .
what &apos;s up ?
get this --
a friend of maura &apos;s from med school just dropped in on her --
guy she hasn &apos;t seen in a decade --
a psychiatrist named dr. kevin foley .
i have a feeling it wasn &apos;t a social visit .
no . she said he was real nervous .
then he started asking questions
about sheila macintyre .
then he asked if she was assaulted
and if we had a suspect .
he has information about our case ,
but he can &apos;t violate doctor / patient confidentiality .
no , but he would have known that before he left the office .
then why bother coming ?
maybe he &apos;s not asking because of a client .
maybe it &apos;s &apos; cause he &apos;s never killed anyone before
and now he &apos;s nervous , so he decides to trick
an old friend into telling him if he &apos;s about to get caught .
dr. foley ?
detective jane rizzoli -- boston homicide .
dr. isles told you about my visit .
i have nothing to say .
well , then , why &apos;d you go see her ?
even if i wanted to , i can &apos;t help you .
listen , clearly something is on your conscience , all right ?
please talk to me .
i can &apos;t . please leave me alone .
did you kill sheila macintyre ?
me ?
no , of course not .
no ?
your little animal study at bcu
giving you a taste for killing things ?
what ? no , you can &apos;t --
none of those animals were ever hurt .
it was a study on the effects of companion animals .
i could never hurt that girl .
but you know who did , don &apos;t you ?
she was 16 years old , and she was stuffed into a cage .
that &apos;s a pretty horrible way to die , don &apos;t you think ?
look , if you didn &apos;t want to help ,
you wouldn &apos;t have gone to maura , okay ?
i can promise you
sheila macintyre will not be the last person to die .
i need to get to my office .
you need to do the right thing , doctor .
so , foley was telling the truth
about his animal studies at bcu .
so the killer must be one of foley &apos;s patients .
he wants to tell us , but he can &apos;t .
i hate to state the obvious , but no judge is gonna give us
a warrant to go digging through foley &apos;s patients &apos; records .
and the surveillance won &apos;t help us , either .
too many other businesses in the building
to be sure who &apos;s going in to see foley .
you guys aren &apos;t helping .
okay , the tox report says she was administered
a fatal dose of tiletamine and zolazepam .
those are euthanizing agents used by veterinarians .
wait a minute . we can do an end run .
if you check with the d.e.a. ,
see who has access to those drugs ,
i can subpoena foley &apos;s billing records
to the insurance companies .
then frankie can cross @-@ reference
the names we get from the d.e.a. with the billing records .
yeah .
and if foley is treating anyone on the d.e.a. list ,
that might be enough for a judge to sign a warrant .
i &apos;ll get on it
right after i cancel the plans i had
for the rest of my life .
we need a new angle on this .
a full profile is impossible .
there &apos;s only one data point .
no , there &apos;s two .
he killed someone ,
and he &apos;s probably one of foley &apos;s patients .
still .
maura , please .
anything that you got is more than what i &apos;ve got .
the subject is a male . he &apos;s an immature killer .
so sheila was probably his first kill .
yes . he &apos;s intelligent and organized .
he obtained a cage . he picked a hiding spot .
he acquired the drugs necessary to carry out his plan ,
and he selected a victim .
does the cage suggest some sort of need
for domination or something ?
no . i think it &apos;s for the ritual .
the drugs he used have a side effect .
when animals are injected with it ,
their eyes have to be taped shut or they stay open .
it &apos;s not a cage . it &apos;s a holding pen .
he just stood there and watched the life drain out of her eyes .
quite possibly .
no wonder foley got the heebie @-@ jeebies .
that &apos;s really all i can say .
you sure ?
yes .
really ? nothing ?
you don &apos;t want to , like , ask me something about a couch ,
maybe pitch a color or a texture or ...
curly something ?
no .
hey , mom . what &apos;s up ?
yeah , okay . i &apos;ll be right there .
see you later .
hi , mom . what &apos;s up ?
hi . i was worried about you .
you need to eat something .
and these are your favorites .
these are not my favorite .
these are not even napkins . they &apos;re fabric swatch--
ma ,
i can &apos;t believe you called me in to do this right now .
come on . maura wants to do something nice for you .
fine .
i &apos;ve made a decision .
toasted walnut pearl ?
corinthian coral ?
i like my couch .
that &apos;s my decision , okay ?
i don &apos;t want a gift couch with obligations .
maura &apos;s not giving you a gift
with obligations attached to it .
really ?
are you calling her ?
of course .
hi , jane .
um , question --
what would you do if i dropped a piece of pizza
on this gift couch you were gonna give me ?
well , that &apos;s not even a challenge .
i &apos;d take a bit of baking soda .
i would sprinkle it on the stain .
i &apos;d make sure the stain was completely covered .
then you allow the baking soda to absorb the grease
from the upholstery for 15 to 20 minutes .
okay , that &apos;s 15 to 20 too long .
i have a three @-@ step process .
i would pick up the pizza , i would eat the pizza ,
and then i would dab the spot with a paper towel .
but that &apos;s unsanitary .
especially if you drop food on a regular basis .
i like my couch .
no new couch .
i got to go .
rizzoli .
uh , yes , dr. foley . 3 : 15 would be fine .
thank you .
these are all disgusting .
we don &apos;t want to disturb dr. foley if he &apos;s with a client ,
but he did ask us to be here at 3 : 15 .
i don &apos;t see anything entered into his calendar for this afternoon ,
but sometimes doctors forget to enter their last @-@ minute appointments .
dr. foley ?
that &apos;s odd .
if the red light is on ,
he should be in there with a client .
um , would you mind stepping over here for a second , please ?
dr. foley ?
he &apos;s dead .
please don &apos;t hurt me .
he tell you what happened ?
no . all i got was his name -- daniel o &apos;neill --
his age -- 16 years --
and a request to call his parents .
paramedics clear him for travel ?
yeah . couple of uniforms are taking him down to h.q.
foley told us to be here at 3 : 15 --
while daniel was still here .
wanted us to get a look at the kid ,
see if we could figure out his connection to the murder ?
he had to have told daniel that we were coming .
i bet he wanted daniel to turn himself in .
well , that didn &apos;t work out as planned .
panic button .
you can hear that all the way down the hall .
well , it only works if you can get to it .
the blood spatter on his clothes
places daniel directly in front of dr. foley
when he was stabbed .
so , daniel killed him .
i can &apos;t say that .
did you ever play &quot; clue &quot; ?
two people in a room . one person &apos;s dead .
the other person &apos;s covered in blood . who &apos;s the murderer ?
well , i think it &apos;s the person
that left their fingerprints on the murder weapon .
you know , about that ufo stuff --
i &apos;m not surprised you saw a ufo when you were a kid .
you &apos;re not ? why ?
there have been 13 recorded ufo sightings in boston
in the last two years alone .
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m telling you .
what ? you don &apos;t know what ?
i was just asking frankie if the restaurant
at the top of the prudential center really turns around .
it doesn &apos;t .
what do we know about daniel ?
he &apos;s been homeschooled since the 5th grade ,
but he finished in the top 1 % of his high @-@ school class
on the district &apos;s standardized tests .
when did he start seeing dr. foley ?
about six months ago .
all right , call me if you get anything else .
sure thing .
prints on the letter opener are daniel &apos;s .
let &apos;s see what he has to say about that .
thank you .
i never should have let you talk me into taking him there .
you went along with it . you knew --
there is absolutely nothing wrong with him .
boys will be boys .
mr. and mrs. o &apos;neill , i &apos;m detective jane rizzoli .
obviously , we understand how hard this is
for all of you , daniel especially .
i don &apos;t want to talk about it .
i can understand that , but i think it &apos;s important
that you tell us what happened today .
anything to tie this kid to the macintyre murder ?
not yet , ernie .
but we &apos;ve got plenty of evidence
that makes him good for foley &apos;s murder ,
including his fingerprints on the murder weapon .
i don &apos;t know what you expect him to say .
the truth .
witnessing something like he did ...
he &apos;s supposed to get over that ?
daniel , why don &apos;t you
tell your parents what really happened today .
what the hell are you talking about ? what are you saying ?
the physical evidence proves
that it was daniel who stabbed dr. foley .
daniel , what were you and dr. foley talking about recently ?
i don &apos;t know .
stuff .
why were you in dr. foley &apos;s office today ?
just a regular appointment .
your regular appointments are on thursdays .
he ...
he asked me to come in .
did he say why ?
daniel .
why were you in dr. foley &apos;s office today ?
he was molesting me , and i was gonna tell .
he &apos;s lying .
you got any proof of that ?
no .
look , i &apos;m not saying daniel didn &apos;t kill dr. foley ,
but look at him .
right now , a jury is gonna see that kid ,
a kid who was defending himself against a sexual predator .
he &apos;s not going forward with this .
that little shit killed sheila macintyre .
i know it .
but you can &apos;t prove it .
no , but dr. foley could .
and he was gonna turn him over to us .
get a subpoena for his records .
nothing that kid says to his psychiatrist
will see the light of day in a courtroom .
no , but he just opened that door for us
by accusing foley of molesting him .
that might work .
you should have gone to law school .
we can hold him ?
yes , when the records tie him to the macintyre girl &apos;s murder .
until then , foley &apos;s death is self @-@ defense .
daniel o &apos;neill gets released to his parents .
six months of therapy -- there &apos;s not a single note
about murder , violence , or anger towards women .
what the hell was dr. foley so worried about ?
i got your message .
what do you need ?
pretzels .
from your vending machine .
i ...
well , you didn &apos;t say --
d @-@ do you really want pretzels ?
no .
i really want to know
why daniel o &apos;neill &apos;s therapy file is so unhelpful .
well , you knew dr. foley .
a long time ago .
okay , well , did he have some weird note @-@ taking system , then ?
i mean , we &apos;ve looked for audio files , iclouds ,
receipts for off @-@ site storage .
these are session notes .
yes .
so , where are daniel &apos;s narratives ?
narratives ?
foley practiced narrative therapy .
the client writes or talks about his life
as it is or as he wishes it would be .
so , i would expect to see at least one of those in the file .
well , we didn &apos;t get anything like that from mrs. lewis .
she didn &apos;t strike me as someone who would misplace files .
no .
daniel took them .
well , they weren &apos;t on him after the murder .
i searched all of his clothes .
they weren &apos;t in dr. foley &apos;s desk .
what if he put them in the other patients &apos; files ?
he knows we can &apos;t get in there . that &apos;s client confidentiality .
i &apos;ll see if i can convince mrs. lewis to look through everything .
interesting .
daniel &apos;s only real passion was volunteering
at the composer hill animal shelter .
that &apos;s a perfect place for him to have access
to the drugs and the cage .
i think i need to adopt a new dog .
i &apos;ve complied with the subpoena .
you have everything in the o &apos;neill boy &apos;s file .
i know , but it appears as though some pages might be missing --
the narratives ?
i &apos;m sorry , sergeant .
i don &apos;t know anything about that .
well , what if they were accidentally misfiled by dr. foley ?
or intentionally misfiled by daniel o &apos;neill ?
that would be highly unlikely .
but what if he did ...
and all those files were lost when they were sent
to the new doctors taking over all of dr. foley &apos;s patients ?
and i know you want everything to be in order when it goes .
sergeant , i don &apos;t think this is a good time to do this --
we think daniel o &apos;neill murdered this girl .
she was 16 years old .
poor child .
she looks familiar .
i certainly wouldn &apos;t want any of these files
to leave here incomplete .
take a seat . this may take a while .
you needed to see me ?
holy shit .
what ?
why would you do that ?
do what ?
sneak in here like some kind of ninja .
oh , that wasn &apos;t sneaking .
watch this . ninja .
i am a ninja !
okay , okay , now i &apos;m afraid you &apos;re gonna fall .
no . i &apos;m okay .
nice &quot; wounded goose , &quot; though .
it was pretty good .
so , did you need to see me ?
yes .
okay .
uh , wait a sec .
what do you got there ?
for me ?
what &apos;s the occasion ?
no occasion . i saw it , and i thought of you .
all right .
this is beautiful .
wait . am i being punked ?
what is -- the keys to my spaceship ?
nope . just for the roof .
you can put the telescope up there --
you know , keep an eye out .
worst case , you get to see a beautiful moon
every now and then .
do you believe there &apos;s life up there ?
i believe that anything is possible .
what are you doing here , daniel ?
i &apos;m out for a ride .
i &apos;m not doing anything .
i @-@ i know where you &apos;ve been today .
my friends at the shelter told me
some bitch cop was around asking about me .
yeah , they miss you there .
nobody could figure out why you quit .
they said you were so good with the animals ...
so ready to be there with them at their final moment .
but we know why you quit , don &apos;t we ?
they don &apos;t kill dogs there anymore .
there &apos;s no thrills for you .
why are you picking on me , jane ?
i &apos;m just a kid .
i &apos;m gonna make sure you never hurt anybody ever again .
good luck with that .
there were 15 daniel o &apos;neill narratives
all stuck in with other patients &apos; files .
so ...
we &apos;re looking for the serial killer / psychopath checklist , huh ?
fire , torture .
voyeurism , antisocial behavior .
i wonder how long it took his mother to realize
there was something really wrong with him .
well , for most parents , i think there &apos;s
a significant degree of denial that has to be overcome ,
as well as the guilt about having your child be such a person .
i can &apos;t imagine .
&quot; fire is alive .
i love to watch it breathe , jump around , dance .
it consumes everything that falls into it ,
that i put into it .
it ripples and twists like it &apos;s trying to escape . &quot;
he did it .
&quot; i &apos;ll take her to the woods . there &apos;s a quiet place i know .
she can rest there safe and secure , untouched .
i want to help her sleep . i know how to do that .
i &apos;ll watch over her until i &apos;m sure she &apos;s gone . &quot;
all the elements of sheila &apos;s murder --
cage in the woods ,
lack of sexual assault , drugs .
this must be the narrative that made foley come to see me .
the narratives aren &apos;t enough
to charge o &apos;neill with sheila &apos;s murder .
a lawyer will just claim
he was coerced to write these stories .
yeah . without dr. foley to give us therapeutic context ,
they &apos;re useless in court .
we might be able to use them for a competence hearing .
裁定被告人能否理解罪名并与律师合作准备辩护
well , between the narratives and the session notes
and what i learned at the animal clinic ,
it might be enough to get him committed .
he &apos;s a minor -- and smart .
when he turns 18 , how much do you want to bet
he convinces everyone that he &apos;s cured ?
god , i wish you could have seen
his smug little face in the parking garage .
foley diagnosed him as a high @-@ functioning narcissist .
he thinks he &apos;s smarter than we are .
well , he &apos;s not .
hey , detective .
can i talk to you for a second ?
sure .
you knew that there was a problem with daniel
for quite some time .
was that why you sent him to see dr. foley ?
you know , sending him to see dr. foley is the best thing
that you could have done for him .
you knew that he had hurt someone ,
and i can imagine that was very difficult for you .
please help us .
mrs. o &apos;neill , you can have daniel committed
to a psychiatric hospital , where he will never ,
ever be able to hurt anyone else again .
please .
i know this is difficult .
please help us .
okay .
i &apos;ll help you .
okay .
let &apos;s go .
we need to go to my office .
i have some paperwork to do ,
and then we &apos;ll go straight to the d.a. &apos; s office , okay ?
here you go .
thank you .
mrs. o &apos;neill , i @-@ i &apos;m so sorry .
i left the paperwork upstairs , okay ?
just -- just lock the door , and i &apos;ll be right back , okay ?
damn it .
hi , mom !
open the door , mom , please .
i just want to talk to you for a minute .
you move , you die .
please . i &apos;m -- i &apos;m just a kid .
so was sheila macintyre .
yes .
thank you .
mrs. lewis was right .
sheila macintyre was familiar .
she was a patient of another doctor
in foley &apos;s medical suite with a thursday appointment .
how did we miss that ?
we didn &apos;t .
that doctor moved his practice four months ago .
that &apos;s why mrs. lewis recognized the photograph
but didn &apos;t remember her name .
so , sheila spent two months in a waiting room with daniel .
she probably told him everything about herself .
why did he pick her ?
because she fit in the cage .
well , the lab confirmed --
it was tiletamine and zolazepam in daniel &apos;s syringe .
we also found traces of blood on the needle .
it &apos;s been processed for a dna match to sheila macintyre .
oh , ernie in the d.a. &apos; s office is gonna love this case .
it &apos;s all wrapped up with a bow on top .
speaking of gift @-@ wrapped --
jane , i have a little surprise for you .
you didn &apos;t .
i did .
granted , i had to oil a few hands and tug a few lines ...
no .
she means she grease a few palms and pull a few strings .
... but your new , plain @-@ old @-@ brown ,
no @-@ holes , scotchgarded couch is being delivered tonight .
but i don &apos;t want a new couch .
well , it &apos;s too late . it &apos;s already on its way .
so , happy early birthday .
thank you .
