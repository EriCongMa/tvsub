"Two Against One"
Glioma...fibroma...blastoma.
Whatever the tumor, people assume you approach it the same way.
You find its hiding place in the body,
then open the patient up...
Miranda...M-Miranda, what are you doing? It's 4:00 a.m.
There's a...smell...
something rotting.
I smell...nothing.
I know my son. Before leaving for his dad's,
he left a piece of....food somewhere.
Hey, let's go back to bed, get some sleep.
Tomorrow's a big day.
You're going back to your old job.
Can't you do that in your sleep?
You want me to help you look?
How can you help if you can't even smell the smell?
...And you cut it the hell out.
But you're not just fighting the one tumor...
Dude, you're Jago.
Counter with a wind kick. It'll take him down.
I can't concentrate when you watch me.
What are you even doing awake?
Are you worried about your surgery tomorrow?
Nope.
Can't sleep because of the crying baby next door.
And the...frog and the monkey picture kind of freak me out.
Hey, is this level 7?
Yep. What about you?
Shouldn't you be resting
before you and Dr. Grey operate on me tomorrow?
Video games are good for surgical practice. Gimme that.
I'll show you how to beat Sabrewulf.
You're actually at war with over a billion cells...
Combo!
Nice.
Told you.
Dr. Grey?
You wanted me to wake you if, um --
How is it?
It's starting to have a shape.
Come look.
So there we were, hour four into this messy trauma,
when I say, "That's not an adhesion, that's the ureter."
You guys -- - Shh! I-I -- I'm telling a story here.
Um...oh, uh, creamer.
You said it to the attending?
Yeah, he blew me off.
He didn't stop what he was doing
until the chief resident invoked the 2-challenge rule.
You guys...
It comes from aviation. Say I'm the pilot,
and you're my co-pilot.
You disagree with how I'm flying the plane.
Okay, you say something, and I fly the plane the same way.
Someone else says something, and I don't acknowledge it.
I lose. I have to give up control.
The 2-challenge rule.
I mean, the doctors adopted it to the O.R.
Edwards, what?!
We're 30 minutes away.
Finish your rounds.
You're gonna wanna be in the front row when your life changes.
Oh, yeah. I'm ready.
Dr. Webber, you want to come with us?
Dr. Grey says you're supposed to be up and walking.
Uh, no you...go on down.
Uh, but come back,
'cause you're gonna wanna hear the end of this story.
Everyone knows the end of the story, because you've already told it!
Maybe you shouldn't be listening in on conversations
that take place in other people's rooms, C.J.
Not my fault that you work for a hospital with crap-thin walls!
Yeah, go take a lap!
I will if you do!
Hey, guys!
So I have the results of your compatibility test.
I'm sure we did great.
If we didn't do great, We'll just take it again.
I took my boards twice, so it'll be fine, right?
April, I'm -- I'm sure we did fine.
I mean, we -- we -- we did fine, right?
If I hadn't known you two already,
I would have thought you cheated.
90 percent. We crushed it!
Yes!
She likes to win.
Yeah, no, that's -- that's good. That's good.
Let me get your exercises for this week.
So...
listen, um...
There is one...problem that we really haven't...discussed.
What?
Well, come on, I mean, we're -- we're compatible
but we're certainly not...equal.
Oh, that. Yeah.
I-I-I wasn't sure if that really bothered you.
Of course it really bothers me.
Well, then we should just fix it.
Now...
Before we're married?
Yeah. I mean, the solution's simple.
Yeah, we just have sex.
Get a joint checking account.
Sharky, rundown.
I've pre-rounded on all of your post-ops
and uploaded yesterday's notes.
Mrs. Ott--my aortic ulcer patient?
Uh, echo shows an improving E.F. of 65%.
Nathan Glazier-- my H.L.H.S. baby?
Sats fell to 87. Now in the P.I.C.U.
Mr. Wu--valve repair?
There is no Mr. Wu with a valve repair.
Very good. Here you go.
What's this for?
Well, you stayed up all night keeping my patients awake
while I got a good night's rest. So... coffee.
Are you headed downstairs?
Dr. Grey's presenting the 3-D printer.
Oh, you know what? I'm gonna look at it later.
I-I want to check on the Glazier baby's numbers.
P.I.C.U., one hour.
So is that my tumor?
Yes, and this is your esophagus, which we will remove.
with a section of your colon from down here.
And part of my ass will now be my throat.
Your colon is actually your large intestine,
and again we're only gonna take a piece of it.
Well, honey, now when you give a restaurant a bad review,
people can truly say, "You're talking out of your ass.
When I eat their food,
I can truly say, "It tastes like crap."
The food will not taste like crap.
Hey, I'm still mad at you for Zane's.
I ate there for ten years
until you ruined it for me.
Oh, please, they over-salt everything.
Well, barring complications,
you'll soon be back to bossing us all around about where we eat.
Get another enema.
But he already had one.
Which is why I said, "Another."
Look, we're dealing with the most contaminated part of the body.
Oh! Can I do it after Dr. Grey's presentation?
I don't care when you do it
as long as you deliver Duncan to the O.R.
with a squeaky clean colon.
So when an opening came up for maternal/fetal surgeon,
I thought of you first.
So I pitched you to the board.
And they just want one of us
to sit down with you to interview you.
You'll be meeting with Dr. Torres.
Her resume really speaks for itself.
This is more of a formality.
Well, and maybe an opportunity
to learn a little more about the woman you're dating.
Not necessary at all.
So... anything you can tell me about Dr. Torres?
Um... she's great. I mean, she's my ex...
so she's not that great.
Look, I'm sure she's probably not an ax murderer,
but if there's something there, I will give you a heads-up.
Please don't.
Just be yourself.
Hey.
Hi! Um, this is Dr. Emma Marling.
Dr. Callie Torres.
Good to meet you.
Let's do this.
Dr. Avery, Mrs. Maddox is here to get her drain removed,
and I'll do it after the presentation.
I'll do it myself, Murphy.
Really?
Because I know the case--
Nah, I prefer to do it myself.
Thanks.
What, did I miss it?
You didn't miss it.
Do you think they made a heart?
Mm, Steph won't say,
but I think a heart's too complicated.
Hey.
A bladder?
Come on. What'd you guys print?
I'm not saying.
But your minds will be freakin' blown.
Hey, how'd the drop-off at day care go?
Tear-free. How's your new toy?
Well, you'll have to wait and see like everybody else.
Good morning, everyone.
Morning.
Grey-Sloan Memorial has always valued innovation as a top priority.
And today, the leader of this charge is Dr. Grey.
We should all follow her in pushing the boundaries,
moving medicine forward, finding new ways to innovate.
Dr. Grey?
3-D printing will allow us to customize treatment
for an individual's specific needs.
Instead of ordering and waiting for an implant...
Do you see that?
We are going to be able to print...
the printer, yeah, it's cool.
In-house, on-demand--
No, no, the guy next to her...
Right here. ...- with the eye twitch.
Eventually, even using a patient's own cells to prevent rejection.
Welcome to the age of personalized medicine.
A fork?
Oh, no.
Technology.
Well, at least it isn't a spork.
You guys, we just got the printer yesterday.
We're testing it out. Forks today,
tomorrow, portal veins for actual people.
You guys!
Oh, if your mother could see you now.
She'd take issue with my hair.
She'd be proud.
Did I ever tell you the story
about how I chose my first research project?
Many times. You know, it's looking a little too comfy in here.
Are you getting your laps in?
You can get one in now.
You can walk me to the elevator. I have a patient to see.
Go change the face of medicine.
You need to be doing your laps.
You need to be walking.
Another captive runs screaming from your theater of... boredom.
Move along, C.J.
Oh, you know, you need some new material?
I know your entire repertoire by heart.
They're good stories.
You see?
Even Dr. Kepner's heard them multiple times.
You should come take a walk with me. Come on.
I'll tell you some really good stories.
You get a head start. I'll catch up.
And close your gown. I can see your underwear.
I'm not wearing any.
Uh, Harvey?
Yes?
Can I help you?
No, but I think I can help you.
I can fix that. It'll take about 30 minutes.
Fix what?
The twitch.
I don't know who you are,
but frankly this is none of your business.
And it's not a twitch, it's a-
A hemifacial spasm.
See I can decompress the nerve.
It's minimally invasive. It's barely even a surgery.
Who the hell are you?
He's Derek Shepherd--
one of the best neurosurgeons in the country.
I really think you should let him fix it.
And who are you?
Jackson Avery-- plastics, E.N.T.
I would really love to observe if that's cool with you.
No, that's not cool.
Now if you'll excuse me,
I haven't had a thing to eat all morning.
If you don't eat, I can do it today.
Did you hear Mer just revolutionized the world of cutlery?
No, I... did not.
Working on a liver model.
It's--it's printing up now.
That's great.
It is great.
What the hell's the matter with you two?
Stay out of it.
Okay.
Thanks for letting me pick up a few shifts.
I appreciate that.
Absolutely.
It's good to have you back.
Uh, that's wrong.
My esophagectomy is supposed to be in O.R. 2.
Sorry, trauma came in this morning,
and now you're in... O.R. 3.
But I planned for O.R. 2.
It was set up exactly the way I needed it for my procedure.
O.R. 3's identical to O.R. 2.
Good to have you back, Ben.
What's wrong with O.R. 3?
Is there a smell in there, too?
There is a smell in Tuck's room,
and I'm gonna find it.
Mr. and Mrs. Glazier.
Did you figure out why Nathan's not getting any better?
The left side of your son's heart
can't effectively pump blood to the rest of his body.
So last week we inserted something
to help divert the blood flow to the right side.
Right, you put in the conduit.
Is it not working or something?
The conduit is synthetic.
So in some cases, the body refuses to accept it.
We believe Nathan is in the beginning stages of rejection.
We're running more tests to be sure.
And what happens if he's rejecting it?
Well, first we treat it with medication.
But worst-case scenario,
we take it out and put in a new one.
With another synthetic one,
but won't he just reject that one, too?
Let's not get ahead of ourselves just yet.
We'll let you know as soon as we have more information.
You said you have answers, but you really don't, do you?
Okay, so then, um, after U.W.,
you went to the Cleveland clinic--
That's impressive.
Under Lacy.
And the focus there was on congenital heart disorders.
Oh, but then you left after only a year?
Yeah, there were so many great opportunities out here-- in Seattle.
Really?
And there were some personal elements at play, too.
I was, uh, going through a divorce.
And we both worked at the clinic,
and that became untenable,
it was affecting my work,
so I made a move.
Oh.
No, right, yeah, no, I-I get that.
So then you moved to Seattle Pres?
Yes. A year as an attending,
and then running the maternal/fetal department for the last year.
My research...
Was that hard for you...
to give up your job.
Well, your city, to your ex?
I've been trying to wake him.
Come on, buddy.
We've let you sleep in long enough.
Good morning, Will.
My big day started out as a nightmare
when a clown came in at dawn,
asking me if I wanted a balloon animal.
Clowns are a peds floor hazard.
Are you still going to try to remove all of the tumors today?
It just seems like it's a lot to do all at once.
Will's cancer is a very aggressive sarcoma.
It's an all-or-nothing approach.
We've come up with a plan to remove all of them,
starting with number one.
Some will be a snap, but there are a few tricky ones,
like tumor number eight.
It's deep in the liver, but we'll do our best to get it.
We'll get it.
We'll try.
Um, it's sort of like trying to get past level six.
You know, there are some, uh, fighters,
but we need to be really precise.
We will eat all those dots and kill all those ghosts.
She doesn't play video games.
We'll see you in the O.R.
What are you doing here?
Oh, I switched with Knox.
Uh, Ben Warren.
Uh, I don't know if we met before I left.
Oh, oh I was actually at your wedding.
I got you that pizza stone.
We have a pizza stone?
Yeah, I got you, a, uh, a circular clay stone
about 15 inches in diameter.
It's kind of my standard gift.
Yeah, I-I just used-- always used
typical cookie sheet and poked holes in the foil.
Oh, well then this will change your life.
The crust that always stick to the edges never get burned.
You can really tell the difference?
Mm-hmm, it's the way people should be eating.
You broke scrub.
I'm sorry?
Your left hand dropped below the sterile field.
Go re-scrub.
I didn't move my hand...
Yes...
It did. I saw it.
You want to call me a liar,
you need to go re-scrub now.
Miranda... you need a minute?
I need a quiet O.R. so we can begin.
10 blade.
Right here.
Well, your E.M.G. did confirm that
it is a hemifacial spasm.
So we'll just get you started on some pre-op tests.
Wait, I know I signed the form,
but how do I know this is gonna work?
I mean, I've already tried botox, muscle relaxers, and...
You know,you sell more than just 3-D printers.
Correct.
You know...
I also sell ink cartridges.
No, no, what I mean is that you sell inspiration.
You are the future face of medicine.
Don't you want that face to be twitch-free?
The surgery will work.
See? You should listen to him.
He's a guy in a bathrobe.
I'm Dr. Richard Webber.
I basically trained these two.
You're in good hands.
Right this way.
Dr. Avery...
I know you said you removed Mrs. Maddox's drain,
but I'm worried about a seroma.
Should I go ahead and...
No, no, don't do anything.
I'll do it myself after surgery.
Hey, Murphy!
Get in here.
You didn't hear the end of my story. Come.
I go to his house, we eat dinner,
we talk, we watch tv, we talk...
we kiss, we... other stuff, and then we stop.
I go home, and it's hard, you know,
because it's not like I don't know what I'm missing.
I know what I'm missing.
What do I do?
Hmm? Well, okay, hold on.
What exactly are you asking me?
Well... how do I resist?
Remember when you had that flirtation with intern Murphy,
and then you decided not to take it any further?
Oh. Yeah.
Um, I took that further.
You had sex?
Yeah.
Was it--
Awesome.
This is not-- you're not...
I have to go away from you now.
Ready with tumor number one.
Okay, you see that?
Already going great. One down...
14 to go. I wish we had gotten to him sooner.
He was diagnosed already stage iv.
Typical teenager.
He ignored his symptoms,
didn't want to ask for help from anyone...
And now he's got an abdomen completely covered with tumors.
Well, you're right. He is a typical teenager,
which means he can beat this.
He's strong, able to fight. And what's better?
What?
He's in my O.R.--
in the O.R. of someone standing on the forefront of medicine.
You should print a spoon next.
That way we'll be able to reach tumor number two.
It is an anatomically correct liver model with a portal vein.
It's a plastic blob.I'm starving.
Can they print food or just utensils?
When will the model be done?
10, maybe 12 hours.
That long?
It's life-saving technology, Shane.
If you want it faster, page god.
It's a fake organ. How long for functional items?
Like an actual vascular graft?
Like a pretzel.
Oh, here it is--
"Biodegradable polymers."
What are you looking for?
Nothing. It's just interesting.
Printing's the future.
What's a typical Saturday like for you?
Oh, well, listen,
I know that the new attendings pull the most call.
So I have no problem working weekends.
Oh, yeah, no. I-I'm just-- I'm wondering...
What you do for fun.
What feeds your soul?
I, uh, read.
I like to cook. I like movies.
I have a German shepherd mix named Lila.
But no kids...
From your previous marriage?
Well, previous marriage?
No, I'm just, uh, I'm just--
I'm just sayin', is, uh...
Is kids something you see down the line in your future?
Do you-- do you want kids?
I'm sorry. I don't think you can ask me this legally
in a job interview.
Oh, of course not.
Of course not. No. You know what?
Forget I asked.
I haven't given much thought to kids.
Please, never mind.
But if I do, or when I do,
I imagine girls-- two.
I know that they'll be hell in junior high,
But, uh... I grew up with sisters.
Aw. Nice.
Yeah.
Just a few more questions.
More?
Hey, how's, uh...
How's it all... going?
It's great.
Yeah, we're-- yeah, we're making progress.
Good.
In Japan, they're 3-D making conduits
and seeding them with the patient's cells
before implanting them, taking away the risk of rejection.
Uh-huh. Yay, Japan.
Why can't we do that?
Why can't we use a 3-D printer to create
a conduit that Nathan's body would recognize as his own?
He wouldn't need surgery after surgery
to keep replacing the failed synthetic one.
It's brilliant, but the research alone--
I thought you'd say that. Here are the Japanese studies.
We would need extensive imaging
to see if nathan's even a candidate.
Also covered.
I've scheduled a cardiac C.T. and M.R.I.
It's-- it's too experimental.
We'd have to file a compassionate release
with the F.D.A., get approval.
These things take time
that Nathan may not have.
If I start the ground work
with the F.D.A...
then will you consider it?
Sure.
Right there.
Can we talk?
Hi. Yes, can we?
I want our wedding night to be amazing.
So do I.
And I want our first time to be--
And that's the thing.
Uh, it will be the first time... for me.
I-I just--I want it to be right.
Before we have sex,
I want us to commit to one another
in the presence of god and--
April...
I love you.
Yeah.
And I am going to love you the rest of my life.
And I think that god knows that.
I think he knows how we feel.
Or she.
Or she.
Well...
Reverend Drew did say that we should...
support... one another.
So, if--if this is really important to you.
It is really, really important to me.
Really?
Okay.
Okay?
Hey, those adhesions are stuck to the intestines.
So make sure you're on the right plane of dissection.
Think I'm finally getting through--
Dah! Careful!
Wilson, if you cut the bowel instead of the adhesion,
There'll be spillage,
All over the man's abdominal cavity.
Right.
You know, just... just let me do it.
Dr. Bailey!
I need to feel the tissue myself.
Dr. Bailey!
What?
Spillage.
Irrigation.
Dr. Bailey.
Dr. Bailey.
Miranda.
More irrigation.
Dr. Bailey!
Miranda.
Irrigation, now.
We need to completely wash out the abdomen.
Did you completely wash it out?
I have several times.
I don't see any stool or contamination.
And we need to get it closed, A.S.A.P.
The hole can cause sepsis, which could drop blood pressure.
Vitals are steady. We're fine.
We still have all the anastomoses.
Just concentrate on one thing at a time.
We fix the hole.
Then we move on to the next step.
It's just a routine complication.
That happens.
Everything's under control. We're good.
You good, Miranda?
3-0 vicryl.
Are all the materials biocompatible?
Depends on the cartridge.
What happens if you, like...
You know, pause it?
Start something else?
You'd be stuck with a hunk of junk.
And then Dr. Grey would have to start over,
sending her back a whole day in her research,
resulting in her desire to murder me.
Great.
Vertebral artery is tortuous.
See, it's compressing the facial nerve
which is the source of the twitch.
You wanna do the decompression?
Hell, yeah.
Dr. Avery?
Trauma's asking if we can take a look
at a huge facial lac in the I.C.U.
Should I do the sutures?
No, definitely not.
I can handle it.
Seriously.
Seriously, I'll be there in an hour.
Thank you.
Murphy's not bad, you know.
Oh, I know.
It's just that I'm better.
Can I have a pledget, please?
Thank you.
Put it to the left, dumbass.
What?
Are you a half-wit?
I said place it to the left, idiot.
Those are things Mark Sloan used to say
when he thought he was better than you.
Are we taking a walk down memory lane now?
You know, I convinced him to start teaching you.
You're a full-wit. Now you have to start teaching the residents.
Hand them the keys.
And let them take it on a joyride?
I don't think so.
Well, pretty soon they're gonna be 18 and have their own cars.
Let's teach 'em before they get there.
All right, securing the pad with fibrin glue.
You're gonna need a lot of that, asshat.
All right, I get it. Point made.
I know. It's just so fun.
There she is. Number eight.
Right smack in the middle of the liver.
Let's skip it.
Skip it? Why would we do that?
We'll come back to it.
No, we planned this surgery in an order.
We should stick to it.
Alex, if we remove the other ones first,
we'll have better exposure.
Let's just come back to it.
It's the hardest one.
If it turns out we can't remove it,
what's the point of even going for the easy ones?
Look, we should try--
I hear what you're saying,
but I'm the lead surgeon on this,
and I'm making the call.
Let's go to number nine.
Dr. Yang!
P.I.C.U. just paged.
Nathan's definitely in full-blown rejection.
I did it.
Did what?
I spoke to the F.D.A., filled out the release,
I just need you to sign it...
before they can start reviewing it.
Ross.
We're not gonna do it. Call them back.
You said you'd consider it if I covered the obstacles.
There are other options. Safer options.
We can increase his I.V. steroids,
start prograf--
No!
None of those are as good as a biological conduit.
I have all the information. We have the printer.
Ross.
It's not our printer.
It's Dr. Grey's printer,
and she is using it to print now.
So we can't do it.
I'm sorry.
Then I pan-sear them for a few minutes
on both sides until they're brown.
And?
And that's how I make my famous meatballs.
That's not a story. That's a recipe.
At least it got you to shut your yap for a hot minute.
Eh, it's useful.
Uh, you know, uh, besides,
it's better than you speaking about--
C.J.?
C.J.?
C.J.?
C.J.--
C.J.!
C.J.! I need some help!
C.J.
Dr. Webber?
Let me take over...
Okay, okay, I got this.
Kepner, get a crash cart.
Okay, get me one of epi and 300 of amiodarone, now!
On it.
Code blue, third floor.
Come on, C.J.
Code blue, third floor.
Callie loved you.
She's very nice.
Very thorough, but very nice.
How long have you two been divorced?
Um, well, I don't-- I don't think that we are.
W-we're sort of separated, I-I guess.
Ah, you still have the ring.
But you're seeing other people, obviously.
Um, yeah. We are.
I'm so sorry. That was way too personal.
I just out of a job interview
that was more intimate than most rectal exams.
I'm just not used to it.
Uh, we don't do things like this at Seattle Pres.
Well, then, come work here.
Because we do way too personal on a daily basis.
We'll isolate the vessels,
then take the tumor out under direct vision.
I can do it.
I don't know if you can, Mer.
It might be better just to close him.
Well, if we don't resect it, the cancer will only spread,
and it'll eliminate his chances of beating this thing.
How do you get it without taking the entire liver?
Dr. Grey,
I just wanted to show you the latest on the liver model.
Not now.
Edwards, scrub in.
We're gonna need your help retracting.
Alex, he's 15.
I think we need to be as aggressive as we can.
Clamp.
That's the last of the reconstruction, right?
That's right. Ben, can we get a methylene blue test?
Coming right up.
Wilson, watch closely. If there's blue--
There's a leak, on it.
No blue.
Nice work, you guys.
Let's also get a bubble test.
Do we need both?
We need to be absolutely sure that there's no leak.
If there's a breakdown somewhere in the anastomosis,
then bacteria can seep through, going god knows where,
causing a potential fatal infection.
Is that what you want for the patient, Wilson?
No, ma'am.
You know, bubble test only takes a second.
So, uh, Wilson, as I inject air into the N.G. Tube,
submerge his chest with saline.
Okay.
No bubble. Should we start to close?
We're not closing. There's a leak.
There's a leak.
I see a small bubble, so there's a leak.
We'll patch it.
A bubble? I don't see anything.
It's there.
Dr. Warren?
Um, you know, I...
didn't have a very good angle from over here,
but I trust Dr. Bailey if she saw a bubble.
Might as well put a patch on to be safe.
We'll oversew it and cover it with a muscle flap.
Suction. Scissors.
Uh, Harvey, are--are you okay?
I'm waiting for it to twitch.
It's twitched for 20 years.
You can wait all you want, but it's gone.
We got it.
Thank you.
Who do you wanna see first?
The facial lac or Mrs. Maddox?
I'll take 'em both.
Okay, I will take Mrs. Maddox,
and you can take the facial lac.
You know what? Why don't-- why don't you take 'em both?
Dr. Avery, I will not disappoint you.
How you holding up?
I'm exhausted.
You should've let me do the C.P.R.
No, no, it's a... good exhausted.
I've been stuck in this bed,
reminiscing about my old life,
trying to feel like my--myself again.
And now I wanna be myself again.
Ready to get back to my feet and...
be the doctor I used to be.
I lost myself there for a while, Kepner.
But now I'm ready to get myself back.
He's in florid heart failure.
His E.F. is falling precipitously.
It's the hospital's printer.
You taught me to take what I need for my patient.
We can't. Not this time.
I looked at Dr. Grey's research. She still has months to go
before printing a portal vein that will actually go
into a human patient.
But this? Building a scaffold seated with cells,
we can do this. This baby can be saved today.
I know, Shane. You think I don't know this?
Now set up for a pericardiocentesis
and do a repeat ECHO in an hour.
Mer, you have to stop now.
I'm about to do the trisegmentectomy--
Any further, you're gonna move into segment two and three.
And it will be fine!
There won't be enough functioning liver to support this kid.
I think it will, and I will stop before I'm too deep.
You print one damn fork, and now you think
you're Moses or something.
Alex, I am in the middle of dividing this kid's liver.
And I need this conversation to be over!
Oh, you gonna pull rank on me again?
Is that how the decision's made?
You could 2-challenge rule.
What?
Dr. Webber told us about the 2-challenge rule
where two surgeons who agree can force a third surgeon
to stand down from a course of action.
Okay, fine.
So, Dr. Edwards, you and I challenge
Dr. Karev to relax and let me finish.
No, I'm challenging you, mer.
I'm asking you to stop what you're doing.
Edwards?
Dr. Grey... I think you're amazing.
And you made a beautiful fork,
and I am so grateful to have been a part of that.
But right now I do think you're pushing it.
And I have to second Dr. Karev's challenge.
Dr. Karev, you can close.
So Robbins says everybody loves you.
I can't work here.
What?
These people are great. They're incredibly nice
and overly kind and a little nosy,
but great.
But they're your people, and they love you.
And they care about you.
And they'll close ranks around you.
They'll...
Uh, look, I worked with my husband,
and when our marriage fell apart...
If something happens to us,
if we broke up, they would all choose you.
And they'd want my...
blood.
I would just be the bitch that broke your heart.
Are you...
Are you planning to break my heart?
No, but...
So don't do it.
Take the job.
Owen, I can't.
I can't risk it.
Hey, you don't do it either.
Do what?
Break my heart.
So... what does that mean? Another surgery?
More chemo and radiation?
It means more time on the peds floor.
Yeah, it--it sucks.
Um, but, you know, while you're here,
we'll get some things from home.
You know, extend visiting hours
so, uh, your friends can hang out.
And, uh, look, I'll--I'll make sure...
That, uh, no one rounds on you before 11:00.
No more peds stuff.
Deal?
Deal.
Sorry about what happened in the O.R.
But we made the right decision.
I could've gotten that tumor.
Nobody could've gotten that tumor.
I could have.
Mer, I need to talk to you.
I need a minute.
It's about a patient of mine.
Well, I'm talking about a patient of mine right now,
so I need a minute.
I-I need the printer.
It's my printer, Cristina.
No, it's not.
It's the hospital's printer, and--
Which I got for them for my research,
for my grant.
Which is important research, but at this point,
It's research, Meredith.
And what I'm talking about could save a life.
I can't stop it in the middle.
It will completely destroy the model.
Just because I printed a fork
does not mean my research is a joke.
No one said it was a joke.
But see, I could--I could print a scaffolding
and--and make a biological conduit
for a baby's heart.
They're not even doing that yet.
They are in Japan.
So if I get compassionate release--
I don't have time to argue.
Submit a proposal to the board
if you wanna use the printer.
It's time-sensitive, Meredith.
Well, then you better get to work.
So that's what it was about in there?
You and Yang?
She calls you a lousy doctor,
and suddenly you have something to prove?
That is not what this is about.
Oh, so y-you take it out on my patient.
I did not take it out on your patient.
Look, you need to be told you're good?
Fine, Mer. You're good.
But Yang was right. You're a lousy doctor today.
Torres!
Come walk with me.
Looking good, sir.
Feeling good.
You hear I saved the patient in the room next door to me?
I heard there was a code. That was you?
Let me tell you all about it.
I was talking to a patient...
Uh, come in.
I love you, Matthew.
I love you, too.
I lost myself last year.
And I worked really hard to get back to who I was.
The fact that I stumbled in my faith...
it matters... to me.
But it just, it feels so good to be back to who I was
and to have found someone who shares that faith.
And, Matthew, I love you, and I respect you too much
for you to let that go.
And... it's still gonna be a first time for me,
because it's gonna be my first time with you.
Oh, it's gonna be amazing.
If we have sex tonight, the only thing that will change
is that you will have broken a promise,
and I know how that feels.
So...
We're waiting.
We're waiting.
You know, we can lean on each other for support.
Okay.
Okay.
All right, but, uh,
maybe we shouldn't actually lean on each other.
You coming in here?
Yeah, in, uh, one minute.
So how do you beat the odds
when it's one against a billion?
I changed our plan on you.
And it'll--it'll take time to figure out our new plan.
But, Miranda, I-I'm glad I'm home,
because something's clearly going on.
Between the checking and re-checking the drawers,
and pulling at your fingertips?
You need help.
What happened today in that O.R.,
you and I both know that there was no bubble.
Uh, there was a smell.
Look, apple slices.
Probably with peanut butter on them at one point.
I found them in Tuck's soccer bag,
and he hasn't been to soccer in weeks.
So, you know, god knows how long
they've been rotting in there.
Miranda, I...
Everything's fine.
You stand strong,
keep pushing yourself past all rational limits...
And never let yourself give up.
Hey! How'd the surgery go?
I could have gotten number eight.
Would you believe me if I told you that
I could have gotten number eight?
Of course.
You wouldn't say you could if you couldn't.
Now would it cheer you up
if I told you I changed the face
of the face of the 3-D printer?
No, because I'll miss his twitch.
You know what this is?
Yes, it's a fork.
No, it's the future.
Go watch your liver model. I'm gonna put the kids down.
But the truth of the matter is...
What the hell are you doing?
Despite how hard you try...
And fight to stay in control...
When it's all said and done...
