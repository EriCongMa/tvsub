ali ?
i &apos;ve been tracking my missing rv .
toby took it . he gave it to &quot; a , &quot;
but spencer already knew that .
i want to explain everything , but i just can &apos;t .
i know you &apos;re trying to protect toby ,
but i really wish you &apos;d
think about the people you were hurting .
if we just tell them the truth ,
&quot; a &quot; is the only chance i have
of finding out what really happened to my mom .
i think &quot; a &quot; gave you something real .
i &apos;ve gotta find dr. palmer .
you tell her to stay away from that girl !
what girl ?
the blonde girl !
the mri confirmed a partial tear of the rotator cuff .
what about swimming ?
there &apos;s a possibility of surgery .
you kissed me , and i pushed you off and then you left .
everybody knows you and mr. fitz
weren &apos;t just scrabble buddies .
you cannot be the guy that helps me feel better anymore .
don &apos;t you get that ?
i &apos;m your brother . i &apos;m supposed to watch out for you .
i &apos;m gonna make it up to you .
stop ! that &apos;s my car ! what are you doing ? !
i found it in my mom &apos;s closet . i have to get rid of it .
hold it !
i didn &apos;t kill anyone ,
and i did nobring a gun into this house !
you have the right to an attorney ...
she didn &apos;t do it !
tell her that you didn &apos;t do it !
i love you .
i think that goes on the top shelf .
really ? thanks for telling me that .
this time .
here . let me do it . i &apos;ll do it .
how &apos;s your shoulder ?
obviously still hurts .
physical therapy isn &apos;t really helping .
neither is tension .
i know . and i &apos;m sorry .
toby just isn &apos;t ready
to let you guys know what &apos;s going on yet .
i swear , we tried to follow shana , but i just--
can we stop talking about shana for a minute ?
we need to concentrate on hanna .
yeah , you &apos;re right .
good . you two are talking .
now if we could only get hanna to eat .
we could order those mozzarella sticks from the brew .
she loves those .
the brew can &apos;t deliver
the one thing she really wants-- her mom .
this stuff is getting rock @-@ hard .
no , don &apos;t throw it out .
maybe hanna &apos;s dad will eat it when he gets back .
or we can use it to chisel mrs. marin out of jail .
i don &apos;t think that would go over so well at her arraignment .
what &apos;s going on with that , anyway ? has hanna said anything ?
only that her dad won &apos;t take her
to any of the meetings with the legal team .
well , i &apos;ll see what i can find out .
look , it &apos;s getting late . why don &apos;t you two head home ,
and i &apos;ll make sure that hanna
gets something to eat before her dad gets back .
it &apos;s time to bust out the big guns
cake frosting and a spoon .
i &apos;m good to stay .
me too .
the only way we &apos;re getting hanna through this is together .
so where is she , anyway ?
just promise me you won &apos;t do anything stupid , caleb .
i would never do anything stupid , hanna .
never ?
you let me into your life .
i think that was the smartest thing i &apos;ve ever done .
you are not going to lose me , hanna . i promise , okay ?
as soon as i find something
to help get these murder charges off of her back ,
i &apos;ll be right there beside you .
coffee ?
i should go .
the girls are downstairs .
okay . i love you .
i love you too .
she &apos;s a tough girl .
who you tellin &apos; ?
you ready to do this ?
本地侦探斯莱
let &apos;s get started .
okay , so the intake session is not covered by insurance ?
no , no , that &apos;s all right . we &apos;ll take the appointment .
all right , thanks .
you &apos;re not working today , are you ?
no .
why ? what &apos;s up ?
someone at the station suggested prolotherapy for your shoulder .
uh , prolotherapy ?
yeah , it &apos;s this series of injections
that stimulate the tissue around the injury
to promote healing .
how many injections ?
well , it &apos;s one a week for about two months .
mom , i can
help pay for part of it if that helps .
no . no , no . the first session &apos;s gonna be a little tricky ,
but insurance should cover most of the treatment .
and if it works the way it &apos;s supposed to ,
then maybe you won &apos;t even have to have surgery .
um , well , the physical therapy has been helping ,
so if we don &apos;t have to spend more money , then ...
honey , look . your father and i both agree
that this is something worth trying ,
so we will find a way to cover the cost , not you .
i &apos;m sorry , it &apos;s hanna .
she &apos;s trying to get in touch with me .
i &apos;m supposed to go over there this afternoon .
look , emily , i know you want to be there for her .
i feel so bad for hanna .
but ... right or wrong ,
ashley &apos;s been accused of murder ..
and i really think that hanna needs
to spend some time with her father right now .
okay , just meet me at the station and we &apos;ll go from there .
and straight after school--
the clinic wants you there at 3 : 45 . okay ?
at least he fixed the windshield .
i wonder how long it &apos;s gonna take him to fix the rest .
he should just sold the thing for scrap and started over .
mike , connor works at a coffee shop .
the only four wheels he can afford is a skateboard .
wait , wait , wait . now you feel sorry for this guy ?
sorry ? no . no .
part of me would have gladly taken a whack at that pi ? ata .
whoever did it knows connor &apos;s a wuss .
that he always gets worked by offense ,
hasn &apos;t fouled out of a game this season .
things get aggressive , he backs down , every time .
you know , you never showed up at emily &apos;s open mic .
sad chicks in hipster glasses
playing the same three chords
and whining about their ex ?
yeah , no thanks .
so ...
you just stayed home ?
really ?
i &apos;m not accusing , i &apos;m just inquiring .
hello ? i play lacrosse .
it &apos;s a tiny little stick .
that car was smashed by a bat , a lead pipe ,
maybe even a sledge hammer .
okay , forget i asked .
i gotta get to class .
so your father decided to stay at the house with you ?
yeah . it &apos;ll just be easier that way .
he doesn &apos;t have to drive me all the way to school ,
and we &apos;ll just stay at his place on the weekends .
isabelle and kate called .
they said nice things , so it shouldn &apos;t be too bad .
sounds like it &apos;s all working out .
um , mrs. hastings said i should pick something
for you to wear to court .
i was thinking the navy suit with the mandarin collar ?
yeah , and there &apos;s a--
a watch that your grandma marin gave me a long time ago .
be sure to grab that .
that &apos;s in the top tray in my jewelry box .
mrs. hastings said no jewelry .
right .
regina is such a tough old broad .
i was hoping some of that would rub off .
i could really use some &quot; tough &quot; right now .
um ... so the silent auction
for the school library renovation &apos;s coming up .
yeah .
it &apos;s gonna be in this swank new restaurant in the city .
i don &apos;t know , i was thinking that
maybe i should get us ticket before it sells out .
don &apos;t , sweetie .
i heard it might be black @-@ tie this year .
i @-@ i just need to get through the arraignment .
that &apos;s all i can think about right now .
well , we can bid like crazy on a spa package
or a ski trip .
hanna .
promise me you &apos;ll be my date .
i can &apos;t promise you that .
yes , you can .
because you &apos;re going with me .
you sure that spencer remembered that partial tail number right ?
i feel like i &apos;ve been at this for days .
she can quote entire passages of dostoyevsky--
in two languages . keep trying .
you really think that tracking down this plane is our best shot ?
when i was working with mona ,
she thought red coat was pulling the strings .
getting the girls to the lodge that night to burn the place down ?
that &apos;s definitely an &quot; a &quot; move .
hanna thinks that alison is still alive .
yeah , spencer saw her too .
everyone else just saw a blond in a red coat .
what about you ?
out cold .
for all i know , she &apos;s the one who clocked me .
you know , what i don &apos;t get is how did red coat
get from thornhill all the way back to town to frame hanna &apos;s mom ?
when we find her , we &apos;ll ask .
switch ?
gladly .
i was looking for a pen earlier ,
and i found this .
did you read that ?
no . i just ...
i thought-- red coat is &quot; a , &quot; right ?
we &apos;re looking for a blond .
it &apos;s not this .
what we &apos;re after , it &apos;s , uh , something else .
o @-@ kay .
i &apos;m starving . do you , um , want anything from downstairs ?
i &apos;ll take a sandwich or something .
okay .
wait .
we got a hit .
same kind of plane as the one at thornhill .
the flight plans are private .
the address of record is at howell acres flight center .
that &apos;s not far from here .
i &apos;ll drive .
no one &apos;s seen shana since the open mic .
it &apos;s like she disappeared .
she can &apos;t just disappear . this isn &apos;t hogworts .
there &apos;s only so many halls and classrooms .
well , she sped out of ravenswood in jenna &apos;s mustang .
maybe she knows that spencer and toby saw her .
maybe she doesn &apos;t want to answer any questions .
she &apos;ll pop up again .
like it or not , she always does .
i could have brought that to you .
i was out earlier anyway .
i went to go visit my mom .
how is she ?
can i help you ?
emily . i can take it from here .
so i &apos;ll see you later ?
yeah , as soon as i can .
i &apos;m surprised you showed up today .
um , this is about the essay i didn &apos;t turn in yesterday , right ?
no , this is about me checking in .
with all you &apos;re going through ,
i can &apos;t imagine leaving the house , let alone coming here .
how are you doing ?
well , it &apos;s not that easy .
everywhere i go people are staring at me all judgey @-@ eyed ,
like that lady in the book .
you know the one .
well , there are a lot of books in the world , hanna .
like , really a lot .
no , the @-@ the one with the judgey eyes
and--and the knitting , um ...
madame debarge .
defarge ?
close enough .
um , can i just get an i.o.u. for that essay ?
what essay ?
thank you , mr. fitz .
not forever , though , just until ...
you &apos;ve got a little less on your plate .
i meant thank you for being a really decent guy .
miss montgomery .
i was just coming to find you .
we have an issue .
we do ?
your brother mike .
i just got a call from the police department .
a student &apos;s car was vandalized ,
and it &apos;s possible your brother was involved .
do you know anything about that ?
no . i mean , i--
i was at the brew when it happened ,
but i @-@ i didn &apos;t see anything .
and your brother was--
i invited him to come to the show .
but he--he said that he wanted to video @-@ chat with my mom ,
so he stayed home .
and connor &apos;s car was at the brew when it happened , so--
is that all ?
not quite .
his medication-- is your brother still taking it ?
yes , of course . what does that have to do--
there were some problems last year , aria .
i know that you &apos;re aware
of the ways in which your brother acted out .
a fist fight , some theft--
i &apos;m just trying to get a look at the overall picture here .
mr. hackett , mike &apos;s fine .
thank you , miss montgomery . you &apos;re excused .
i &apos;m a little busier than i thought i would be here today .
are you sure you &apos;re okay doing this by yourself ?
i guess so .
is lieutenant tanner in today ?
i saw her in passing this morning .
here you go .
but you didn &apos;t talk to her ?
no .
why ?
uh , she came by the open mic .
i wanted to ask her if she liked it .
okay , so i &apos;ve already faxed over the intake paperwork .
just show them the insurance card
when you check in with the receptionist .
i &apos;ve got a key to sign in .
hang on one second .
what &apos;s the case number ?
w @-@ 4 @-@ 6 @-@ 8 @-@ 0 @-@ 9 .
.. 4 @-@ 6 ...
here .
okay , thanks .
are the police still looking for other suspects in wilden &apos;s murder ?
yes , emily . the investigation is still ongoing .
mom , can you print out the directions to the clinic ?
i &apos;m not quite sure how to get there .
yeah .
i meant to do that earlier . i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry .
okay . i &apos;ll be right back .
yeah . no , i understand .
okay , well , we will-- we &apos;ll see you then .
is your brother with you ?
i think he has practice .
well , i hope for his sake
this is all just a huge misunderstanding .
i was ...
i just got off the phone with the school ,
and one of his teammates is filing a police report ,
and that kid &apos;s father is pressing to have him expelled .
expelled ?
yes .
over some kind of damage to a car ?
it &apos;s that kid . connor .
the one that you tutored last week .
did you notice any tension between them ?
i mean , is it-- is there any truth to this ?
aria ... if you know something about this ,
i need you to tell me .
i think this is happening because of me .
connor kissed me , and i said that i wasn &apos;t interested ,
so he ... started this rumor at school .
what kind of rumor ?
the kind that &apos;s really not worth repeating .
why didn &apos;t you come to me with this ?
because i thought i &apos;d handled it .
i set connor and his friends straight . i--
why would he say these things about you ?
look , apparently there &apos;s been some talk ...
about me and ezra .
well , i @-@ i guess that connor figured
that since i &apos;d ... dated an older guy
that i would do just about anything with anybody .
dad , i know what you &apos;re gonna say--
no , i &apos;m not concerned with ezra fitz .
i am concerned with your brother
and making sure that he hasn &apos;t gotten himself into trouble .
and from the sound of it , this connor kid is the one
who needs to be scrutinized and punished .
where are you going ?
i need to speak with your brother about this .
okay . you are several steps beyond getting yourself out of gym .
how do you think i &apos;ve been staying home all week ?
i just don &apos;t want my mom to come home to no lights , no hot water ,
and a weedy lawn .
hanna , um , i need you to hear me .
okay , quit making that face .
that &apos;s your &quot; bad news &quot; face .
my mom &apos;s not coming home anytime soon , is she ?
i overheard my mom talking strategy with my dad .
and ?
and from what it sounds like ,
it &apos;d probably be better if she had done it .
your mom and wilden had a really tense history .
prove that he threatened her ,
and they could go for voluntary manslaughter ...
which is twenty years .
and if not ...
... then it &apos;s first @-@ degree murder .
and my mom spends the rest of her life in jail .
or worse . maybe .
that &apos;s just how bad it looks .
no . that &apos;s how bad &quot; a &quot; made it look .
runway 31 left cleared for takeoff .
how can i help you guys ?
uh , yeah , my buddy here , he got stiffed on a kitchen remodel ,
and the guy owns a plane ,
we think he keeps it here .
maybe you could help us see if he skipped town ?
anybody can look up a flight plan online .
do you have the tail number ?
we tried that and nothing came up .
must be enrolled in the blocked aircraft registry .
happens sometimes-- celebrities , corporations .
private planes ?
sometimes .
but they still have to register a flight plan .
if his plane took off or landed here ,
you &apos;d have it on file , right ?
usually .
think you could help us out ?
驾驶员 约翰 · 史密斯
the last time the plane left this airfield
was the night of the fire .
where &apos;s that destination code ?
looks like a regional airport in delaware .
it &apos;s nowhere near thornhill .
no passengers ,
pilot &apos;s name is john smith .
sure it is . and i &apos;m pocahontas .
so , uh ,
let &apos;s just say that this plane
maybe wanted to stop somewhere else .
like thornhill .
yeah , let &apos;s just suppose .
they &apos;d inform air traffic control . or not . depends .
this guy may not want people knowing where he went .
we got nothin &apos; .
different flight plan , no girl onboard .
ah . so it &apos;s not about a kitchen-- it &apos;s about a girl .
to be honest , there was a lot of fog that night ,
and thornhill &apos;s barely a landing strip .
it would have been really hard to land there
under those conditions in the dark .
sorry .
all right . well , thank you for the information .
hope you find your girl .
i wish i &apos;d kept my mouth shut .
hanna knows it doesn &apos;t look good .
the question is , can it get any worse ?
hanna &apos;s mom , emily &apos;s parents , my mom , and now my brother ?
you think &quot; a &quot; took a bat to connor &apos;s car ?
please . this has &quot; a &quot; spray @-@ painted all over it .
come on , guys . let &apos;s go .
to your doctor &apos;s appointment ?
emily , it &apos;s just a shot .
this is about who shot wilden .
we still have time to find another murder suspect .
any maybe save hanna &apos;s mom ?
whatever it is , we &apos;re in .
good--
&apos;cause we &apos;re breaking in to wilden &apos;s apartment .
looks like his apartment &apos;s as messy as his police work .
the investigators probably turned this place over a few times .
i don &apos;t think this mess is all him .
they the ones who left his boxes on the floor too ?
lights stay off , remember .
and try and put things back where you found them
in case the police come back again .
aria , gloves .
here .
i &apos;m not literally digging for clues .
i grabbed what i could find .
look for letters , pictures--
anything that might connect wilden to shana and jenna .
i still think they &apos;re gonna be
our best shot at saving hanna &apos;s mom .
the bedroom &apos;s over here .
it &apos;s probably just a telemarketer .
do we pick it up ? or--
it &apos;ll stop when it goes to voicemail .
see ?
keep looking .
i &apos;m blitzed . i &apos;m gonna head home and get some rest .
you can crash here if you want .
is something bugging you ?
the fog .
how &apos;d he know it was foggy that night ?
maybe &apos; cause he &apos;s landed there before ?
you know , and the pilot , that john smith--
name never led anywhere either .
i tried to trace down the owner of the plane ,
but it &apos;s in a trust .
somebody &apos;s blowing a lot of smoke .
what do you make of this ?
uh , the &quot; nw &quot; is bigger-- &quot; northwest . &quot;
or &quot; nigel wright . &quot;
and with the compass i kept thinking &quot; sailor . &quot;
but it could mean &quot; pilot . &quot;
where did you get this ?
i found it at the lodge that night .
i figured whoever started the fire probably used that ,
but i couldn &apos;t do much else with it .
we were all there . if i would have turned it over to the cops ,
there &apos;d be questions-- lots .
so you think he started the fire ?
well , like you said ,
somebody &apos;s blowing a lot of smoke .
i &apos;m guessing it &apos;s our buddy nigel .
kitchen &apos;s clear . i got nothing .
yeah , mail &apos;s pretty tame .
it &apos;s just junk , bills .
i feel weird touching his stuff even with gloves on .
come up with anything ?
not a lot ,
just some family photos , lots and lots of black socks
and his , uh ... film collection .
wilden &apos;s a film buff ?
what , like classics ?
yeah , if you consider &quot; lord of the g @-@ strings &quot; a classic .
it &apos;s weird , though , there &apos;s no plants , no art ,
there &apos;s not a lot of , like , knick @-@ knacks or personal stuff .
i think what i found was pretty personal .
spencer &apos;s right .
it &apos;s like he came here to eat , sleep and change his socks .
i think he did a little more than just change his socks .
and they weren &apos;t even under his socks--
they were just stacked on his nightstand like ,
&quot; hmm . what do i want to watch tonight--
jimmy kimmel or boobs ? &quot;
aria , focus .
we already knew that wilden was a creep , okay ?
and what are we missing ?
did you check that box ?
i didn &apos;t even see that .
might be a gift . that &apos;s pretty personal .
this is from that fancy steak company
my dad always gets from my uncle for his birthday .
ohh ! god , that &apos;s ripe !
i don &apos;t see a note or anything .
oh , my god , it &apos;s making my eyes water .
i hate to say this , but i &apos;m really grateful
for these hideous gloves right now .
&quot; can &apos;t wait to see you at our little barbecue .
kisses , &apos; a. &apos; &quot;
aria .
are you here to see mr. hackett ?
no . no , i &apos;m here for mike .
he &apos;s in there with my dad
and ... connor and connor &apos;s dad .
i saw the car . mike couldn &apos;t have done that .
they &apos;re saying that he did .
mike &apos;s in there getting railroaded ,
and hackett &apos;s just letting it happen .
they &apos;re actually filing a police report . if mike gets expelled--
that &apos;s not gonna happen-- not if he didn &apos;t do it .
aria , i get it-- what you said .
i can &apos;t be the one to swoop in and comfort you .
but it kills me ...
i know .
anyway , hackett &apos;s saying that mike &apos;s crazy
and that he &apos;s off his meds .
i thought he was gonna ask me
to count the pills in his prescription bottle .
did he ask you that ? directly ?
aria , do you know who really did this ?
ezra .
byron .
um , aria &apos;s been telling me what &apos;s been going on .
if there &apos;s anything that i can do ...
no , thanks . i appreciate that offer .
aria , why don &apos;t you go back home and wait .
we &apos;ll see you back there .
you come see me in my office when you &apos;re done .
she doesn &apos;t find that key . we &apos;re gonna have a problem .
did you lose something ?
i don &apos;t smoke .
a lighter might come in handy for other things .
wow , he was such a chatterbox yesterday .
i wonder what happened .
guys , listen ...
you &apos;re the pilot ,
right ? john smith ?
hey , you filed that flight plan to delaware as cover ,
landed at thornhill in the fog ,
delivered a blond girl in a red coat ,
and then you flew her out of there .
who is she , nigel ?
i don &apos;t know anything about a fire . i wasn &apos;t there .
just--i got paid to fake a flight plan .
okay ? and spin a little story
if someone came asking . that &apos;s all .
by who ?
was it her ? the blond ?
i &apos;ll give you your money back , okay ? i just got greedy .
we are gonna need a name .
i could lose my job ! i broke the law !
just ...
her name was--
i don &apos;t know . drake , cece , i think .
just take the money and drop it , all right ?
let him go !
that guy was never gonna tell us the whole story anyway .
but maybe this will .
yes , of course .
i understand .
mr. hackett , may i have a word ?
can &apos;t it wait ? i &apos;m rather in the middle of something .
it &apos;s actually about this .
please . it will only take a moment .
officer , may i call you back ?
yes . i will take care .
thank you .
we &apos;re very close to a solution here .
unless you &apos;ve got something compelling to add--
did anyone actually witness this happening ?
can anyone besides connor say for certain that mike was at fault ?
the school has a zero tolerance policy toward violence .
attacking another person or their property ...
allegedly .
i &apos;m trying to see that
he doesn &apos;t get charges pressed against him .
in exchange , there &apos;s gonna have to be some kind of punishment .
the other family won &apos;t compromise .
i don &apos;t want the boy to suffer unduly .
it &apos;s a good thing his medical history hasn &apos;t come up .
i &apos;d hate to see mike labeled as mentally unstable
and a vandal .
well , you don &apos;t think that &apos;s pertinent information to consider ?
maybe ... if you hadn &apos;t asked his sister .
i can only imagine the can of worms that-- that would open up
if the parent found out .
let me stop you right there , ezra .
now , i can see where i might have made an error in judgment .
but i wonder whether
your very personal bias where the montgomery family is concerned
isn &apos;t an error in yours .
okay , we &apos;re through his password .
look at all those calls to the same number in new york .
and look at the last one .
that was right after we left the airfield .
so you think that this is
where cece drake went when she left town ?
i can get into it and see what i can find out .
but why would she want to ruin ashley marin ?
or hurt hanna ?
or the rest of you , for that matter .
could she have helped wilden set that fire ?
or was wilden helping her ?
she said she was leaving town because she was afraid of wilden .
so maybe the truth is that they set the fire ,
she killed wilden .
and this set @-@ up is her covering her own tracks .
can you think of a reason to believe she &apos;s not &quot; a &quot; ?
toby ,
cece visited mona when she was in radley .
can you give us a minute ?
yeah , just don &apos;t start making out or anything .
believe me , i missed him while you two were playing hardy boys ,
but now is not the time .
how long ago did you find out about cece going to visit radley ?
right before i left there .
i found her visitor &apos;s pass
in mona &apos;s stash .
dr. palmer said to watch out for the blond girl .
any chance that he meant cece ?
you said he was in and out ,
but maybe he wasn &apos;t as out as you thought .
cece could have gotten her hands on your mother &apos;s records .
we won &apos;t know for sure until we find her .
excuse me ?
the video @-@ chatting with mom ?
come on . they could have checked that .
we got sausage king on the way home .
that sounds like a celebration .
w @-@ what happened ?
actually , mr. fitz happened .
what do you mean ?
he talked to hackett , and the next thing i know ,
hackett &apos;s telling connor and his dad
that if the police have no prints or witnesses ,
he &apos;s got no reason to expel me .
now i kinda wish i done it .
or done something .
come on , mike . that &apos;s not you .
maybe it should be .
if anything like this happens to you again ,
i want to be ready .
now come eat .
emily ?
what are you up to ?
just doing some homework .
the clinic called .
you rescheduled your appointment ?
i had something to do . for hanna .
i know your friend is in a terrible situation ,
but this is just as important .
if you ever want to be able to swim again--
i do !
then take it seriously !
i &apos;m gonna bring you to the appointment myself tomorrow .
i &apos;m sorry , mom , okay ?
do you want me to meet you at work again tomorrow ?
no . i won &apos;t be at work .
i was suspended today .
