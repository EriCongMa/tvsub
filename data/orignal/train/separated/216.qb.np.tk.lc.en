gossip girl here--
your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
guess the archibald charm
wasn &apos;t as rusty as you thought ...
unlike the knife in my back .
i like raina , all right , and she likes me .
because of your father , my wife is dead .
no one knows the truth , not even raina .
blair , we kept us a secret
&apos;cause we were afraid there was something more .
you need to go back to brooklyn .
not until i know that
there is nothing between us .
the only mistake was mine ,
when i forged serena &apos;s signature .
he signs over the company right now
or you &apos;re going to jail .
but not because of you or anyone else .
i called the d.a. ten minutes ago .
once i go on record with the truth ,
no one can hold this against us anymore .
i don &apos;t think lily quite realizes what she &apos;s in for .
time to circle the wagons , rufus .
the van der woodsen family is no stranger to the tabloids ,
but this time it appears
the mother of all scandals surrounds the mother .
sources say that lily humphrey
could be facing up to ten years in prison
for forgery and obstruction of justice ...
turn that off .
and leave me alone , dorota . i &apos;ve taken to my bed .
i thought hearing someone has life worse than yours
would help .
well , your job isn &apos;t to think . it &apos;s to serve .
so if i need your help , i &apos;ll ring the bell .
will lily humphrey end up behind bars ?
the society queen allegedly
forged her daughter &apos;s signature on an affidavit
that sent an innocent man to jail for almost three years .
the victim , ben donovan , has been cleared of all charges ,
but it &apos;s unlikely lily humphrey will be so lucky .
she &apos;s holed up in her penthouse apartment
while her lawyers scramble to work out a deal .
we are currently outside of
the van der woodsens &apos; upper east side residence ...
i didn &apos;t realize you stayed .
good morning to you , too .
you okay ?
it &apos;s surreal .
everything happening to lily is because of my dad ,
and i kinda feel like it &apos;s all my fault .
look , it probably would &apos;ve happened
sooner or later anyway .
your dad &apos;s been calling all morning .
hello ?
i already told you my answer .
what do you mean everything could change ?
oddsmakers around town are taking bets
on the length of her prison sentence .
serena !
h @-@ hey , ms. van der woodsen !
has your mother heard any news ?
stand back . let her through . stand back .
hey , chuck .
how &apos;s lily holding up ?
i &apos;m here now . aren &apos;t you coming over for brunch ?
lily thought it would be complicated enough without me .
oh , my grandmother and my stepfather
and my father , who was last seen fleeing from the police
&quot; complicated &quot; is an understatement .
how are things with william ?
well , if i cut everyone out of my life who made a mistake ,
i wouldn &apos;t have anyone left .
on the topic of mistakes ,
do you know one i might have made
to cause blair to cut me off ?
you didn &apos;t talk to her after your party ?
she wouldn &apos;t let me in her room .
when she said she didn &apos;t want to talk to me ,
i didn &apos;t think she meant ever again .
she &apos;s not seeing someone , is she ?
mm , no , not unless you count dorota .
she hasn &apos;t left her bed in a week .
she &apos;s pulling a camille . but why ?
i think her powerful woman path hit a roadblock ,
and you know how important that is to her .
thanks for the heads @-@ up .
give lily my love .
i will . bye .
mm , come on , lil .
reading this is not gonna make things any easier .
well , sometimes it &apos;s better to know what &apos;s out there .
you know , deal with it , move on .
lily and i were just talking about moving on .
oh , what was the topic of that conversation ?
oh , yeah--you .
how many times do i have to tell you ?
i am not going anywhere
until i know that my children are taken care of
in the event that lily can &apos;t do so herself .
it &apos;s not like she &apos;s dying , will , no thanks to you .
and eric and serena already have a father in their lives .
step ... father . it &apos;s not the same .
oh , please !
be gentlemen , you two . we &apos;re all here for lily .
oh , darling .
oh , you look lovely in your mug shot .
it was smart of you to turn yourself in
so you could make sure your hair was done .
yes , mother , that &apos;s why i did it .
well , fortunately ,
in a few short hours , i will be immortalized
in a much more dignified fashion .
the taschen book-- that &apos;s , uh , today ?
it certainly is . oh ! &quot; modern royalty . &quot;
i just love that title .
hey , mom , dad .
hey . hi , sweetheart .
serena , darling , we were ...
grandma .
mm , just talking about the portrait .
how can you do a book on modern royalty
without including me and my girls ?
all of my girls .
what is that supposed to mean ?
hey , you know , listen , thank you for letting me hide out here .
i just needed a time @-@ out
from my mom and my grandma and my dad and ... your dad .
oh , yeah . i mean , of course . my--my house is your safe house .
i &apos;m surprised serena didn &apos;t call you
and ask you to be her backup .
she did , but i figured i &apos;d dodge that war .
hey , does william carlos williams
go under &quot; w &quot; or &quot; c &quot; ?
hmm . this is the first time i &apos;ve ever seen you pass up a chance
to save serena , and you &apos;re alphabetizing . what &apos;s up ?
you swear not to tell anyone or laugh ?
uh , i &apos;ll take your secret to my grave , but laughter is
an uncontrollable bodily response .
i kissed blair waldorf .
wow .
i didn &apos;t see that comin &apos; .
yeah , neither did i.
uh , i mean--it was just--it was just once , and it was weird .
oh , i would expect so , yes .
but weird good ?
like , &quot; i--wow , it &apos;s weird this is such a good kiss &quot; ?
or weird bad ? like , you know , just , &quot; wow . weird &quot; ?
uh ... she didn &apos;t give you any indication at the time ?
no . no , she--she just walked away , stunned ,
left me standing there in her foyer .
mysterious .
i know , right ?
i mean , i did what i thought was the polite thing--
called her the next day .
it &apos;s been almost a week , and i haven &apos;t heard back .
w @-@ wait , wait . why do you care so much ?
do you ... do you like her ?
what ? no . no , no , no . i don &apos;t like her .
no , of course not . not at all . i &apos;m just curious .
sh--and--and , you know , she-- i mean , she does smell nice .
oh ! you are ass @-@ backwards crushing on blair waldorf !
take that away , dorota !
i can &apos;t eat . i only rang to tell you to call the doctor .
i think i have consumption .
consumption not since 19th century . they have vaccine .
well , then i &apos;m dying of malaise .
i know everything has gone wrong since you lost focus on work ,
but carmela on &quot; sopranos &quot; didn &apos;t get big break till she was 40 .
this isn &apos;t about work or time , dorota .
it &apos;s about the truth .
something happened recently that revealed my future ,
and i &apos;ve been hiding ever since
&apos;cause i don &apos;t want to deal with it .
epperly ? what do you want ?
i &apos;m styling the photo shoots for the new york portions
of taschen &apos;s &quot; modern royalty &quot; book .
i know all about it . serena &apos;s in it .
well , my assistant just left me
to work for william and kate &apos;s wedding photographer .
i could really use your help .
me ? after our previous experience ?
aw , you &apos;re a natural fit for something like this ,
what with your impeccable taste
and masterful way of giving orders .
um , it &apos;ll be hard to clear my schedule .
meet me in an hour ? i &apos;ll text you the address .
you &apos;re right , dorota .
maybe i should refocus on work .
feelings and revelations will just have to wait .
she accepted the job , just like you knew she would .
but , uh ...
why go to these lengths , if i may ask ?
someone told me something that made me want my own legacy ,
not my father &apos;s .
i can &apos;t convince blair of her place in it
until she &apos;s feeling powerful again .
well , i hope it works out for you .
ever since i came back from bali , i &apos;m a sucker for romance .
i can &apos;t believe you asked carol here
without clearing it with me first .
what &apos;s to ask ? you &apos;re her sister .
and besides , i knew you &apos;d say no .
oh , for good reason , though ,
because carol turned her back on lily .
well , i would say that there was some blame on both sides .
but rufus does make a point ... for once .
you know , having carol here would be stressful for lily .
oh , my god . what could be more stressful than this ?
she hasn &apos;t even walked through the door ,
and you guys are already at each other &apos;s throats .
i wouldn &apos;t recognize you guys if it were any other way .
hi , sis !
i always knew your house of cards would collapse eventually ,
but i never dreamed you &apos;d actually wind up behind bars .
ah , welcome , carol .
and hey ! mom .
darling .
and lily &apos;s husbands--
one and ... five ?
five .
and serena .
hi , aunt carol . good to see you .
oh , my . your mom used to have long hair just like yours ,
but that &apos;s when she was crashing on tour buses , before she was
getting brazilian blowouts . right , rufus ?
love the loafers .
are those tod &apos;s ?
carol , some of us actually grew up .
i &apos;ll get it .
so , carol , you &apos;re here for the rhodes women portrait .
maybe you could help us pick a theme .
i was thinking &quot; la dolce vita . &quot;
does it have to be a movie ? we could do &quot; chicago . &quot;
you could play roxie hart &apos; cause she was in jail .
i know you think this photo &apos;s frivolous ,
but it &apos;s an important honor for our family .
i &apos;m not the one who ruined this family &apos;s honor .
it wasn &apos;t your lawyer . it was someone from the book .
they canceled the portrait because of the scandal .
i &apos;m sorry , mom .
uh @-@ oh , lily .
looks like instead of being on the pages ,
you &apos;re about to have the book thrown at you .
do you mind hailing me a cab ? thank you .
hey , serena ?
sorry . my family &apos;s not talking to the press .
oh , well , then i guess i &apos;m not either ,
because , technically , i &apos;m your family .
you &apos;re probably wondering how you could be related
to someone who &apos;s so socially awkward .
um ... but i &apos;m your cousin .
charlie ! oh , my god ! i mean , charlotte .
oh , my gosh !
your mom didn &apos;t tell me you were here !
that &apos;s because she doesn &apos;t know .
um ... can we go somewhere and talk ?
yeah , of course . come on .
boys , william may have a solution .
imagine that .
i know benedikt taschen personally .
of course you do .
i &apos;d be happy to call him , see if i can get the ladies
back in the book .
eric , what do you say ?
uh , well , i @-@ i think that mom would really like that .
fine . might as well try .
great .
thanks .
i think the last time i saw you , i was 6 .
you met up with us in the keys on claus &apos; boat .
um , i think they call that a yacht .
didn &apos;t it have an elevator in it ?
yeah , which apparently was enough to make your mom decide
to never let you see us again .
well , she thinks your world &apos;s toxic .
if i &apos;m exposed , i &apos;ll catch it .
oh , well , we may not be perfect ,
but comparing us to the plague is a little extreme .
okay . so you and your brother didn &apos;t both end up
going to a mental institution ?
and your dad didn &apos;t give your mom fake cancer ?
and your mom didn &apos;t send an innocent man to prison
just to get you back into private school .
yeah , maybe when you put it that way ,
we should be quarantined .
no .
i &apos;m sorry . that &apos;s my mom talking .
i &apos;ve grown up so alone , that i ...
i wanted to see what she &apos;s been hiding from me
all these years .
okay . well , i &apos;m not letting you go home
until you spend a day with me .
let me show you this world , and you can decide for yourself
what you think of it . we &apos;ll start with barneys
and then work our way back to intermix .
i &apos;m sorry , lil .
i didn &apos;t realize how important this portrait was to you .
whatcha looking at ?
well , i just figured if i can &apos;t take a new photo ,
i could distract myself with old ones , that &apos;s all .
remember that ?
my ... god .
we were gonna audition to be &quot; solid gold &quot; dancers .
and then we went looking for halter tops
that looked like the girl in the &quot; cherry pie &quot; video .
yeah
and all we could find were these gold unitards .
oh , how &apos;d our dance go ? it was like ...
this was our audition . this was our audition .
right , right . imagine , in halter tops . okay .
no .
oh , you know what ? who needs taschen
when we can take our own family photo ?
but we need the unitards .
yes .
let &apos;s go . let &apos;s go .
kat orth is being shot with her six maiden nieces ,
and chuck bass will be shot by himself .
all by himself ? he has an uncle .
nope . chuck bass is representing his family all alone .
the suttons are next .
they want to be shot with their english setters .
the setters are better @-@ looking than the suttons .
aw , but they love each other anyway ,
just proving that everyone has their soul mate .
yeah , did you join a cult in bali ?
oh , come on , blair . i know you believe in true love , too .
well , i did recently have a moment of perspective myself ,
but thankfully , i didn &apos;t have to go to an ashram to have it .
what happened ?
i kissed someone ,
and it was truly a life @-@ changing experience .
do tell .
i just did . that was it .
but the point is , that one kiss changed me .
fut @-@ the @-@ wuck is she doing here ?
how dare you show your face here ?
oh , well , hello to you , too , blair .
i &apos;m a camera assistant . the job was posted at n.y.u.
i didn &apos;t know serena &apos;s family was coming until i arrived ,
and no , i &apos;m not leaving .
oh , my god .
wow , that dress is incredible .
it would look great on you .
uh , yeah , except for it costs
as much as all the stuff we got today put together ,
so i can &apos;t accept that .
well ... you can accept this .
it &apos;s a family heirloom ,
so it &apos;s just as much yours as it is mine anyway .
serena ...
thank you ...
for everything .
oh , my god . i can &apos;t believe we found them .
you might be upper east side blue blood ,
and i might be florida bohemian , but at bottom ,
the rhodes sisters are still badasses from the valley .
rufus ! yeah , we found leg warmers .
no , i &apos;m not drunk . although ...
yes !
oh , that &apos;s wonderful . you &apos;re kidding !
okay , we &apos;ll be right home .
the photo shoot &apos;s back on .
should we go back and buy something for everyone ?
mom in a unitard . awesome .
i love it !
serena ?
charlie ?
i can explain .
hey , chuck , uh , what-- what are you doing here ?
may i come in ?
yeah .
i &apos;ve learned some information about my past
that &apos;s making me reconsider my future--
my future with blair .
however ,
my intel indicates that she &apos;s seeing someone else .
what &apos;s that got to do with me ?
i think it could be someone at &quot; w. &quot;
didn &apos;t you work there ?
uh ... yeah . for one day .
did you notice her talking to anyone ?
whoever she kissed seems to have had an effect--
&quot; life @-@ changing &quot; were the words she used .
uh , well ... a life @-@ changing kiss
might not be something you wanna mess with .
what are you trying to say , humphrey ?
with you ,
she was always caught up in schemes and takedowns ,
but that &apos;s not-- that &apos;s not really her .
she &apos;s intelligent . she &apos;s intuitive , you know ?
she--she weeps when she watches &quot; nights of cabiria . &quot;
how do you know that ?
uh ... serena told me ,
but listen , the point is ,
if blair &apos;s happy ,
then maybe you should let her be .
you care more about blair &apos;s happiness than i knew .
yeah .
thank you for your time .
epperly , i found out who blair kissed .
i &apos;m going to need one more favor .
i worked hard to keep you away from this world .
i didn &apos;t want you to become a socialite
obsessed with clothes and clubbing
and getting your picture taken .
that &apos;s not fair .
fair is irrelevant . i &apos;m your mother .
i make the rules . you need to trust me .
i have never lied to you .
listen , i want you to return everything that you bought
and meet me back at my hotel .
uh , necklace ?
for god sakes , carol , it &apos;s a necklace ,
not a heroin needle .
we were just hanging out .
and you bought her $ 1,000 worth of clothes .
that &apos;s obscene .
we &apos;re leaving . i &apos;m just here to say good @-@ bye to mother .
i just got your message .
i can &apos;t believe you won &apos;t come upstairs .
carol , please . serena didn &apos;t mean any harm .
you and i were just having so much fun together ,
and william and rufus got the photo shoot back on .
at least stay for that .
you may think
it &apos;s okay for your kids to have superficial values ,
but i left this life to raise charlie in the real world ,
and i am not letting you seduce her .
great , then i hope you won &apos;t mind
if i don &apos;t stay and watch you go .
hey , you okay ?
oh , yes , i &apos;m fine , sweetheart .
you don &apos;t have to come up .
funny .
wanting nothing to do with this superficial world
hasn &apos;t deterred you from taking my money .
oh , you got what you paid for , mother .
i showed up . i was as supportive as i possibly could be ,
and now i &apos;m leaving .
i send you a check every month .
you will stay for this photo .
that wasn &apos;t part of the deal .
now i &apos;m going to my hotel to pack ,
and charlie and i are gonna take the next plane out .
so get this--i got a call that i &apos;m being included
in the &quot; modern royalty &quot; book .
hmm , no offense , but why ?
oh , none taken , &apos; cause that was my first thought also .
i @-@ i guess there &apos;s some &quot; coup d &apos;etat &quot; section
for up and comers .
uh , yeah , that sounds totally made up .
um , you know , blair is working the photo shoot .
she called to confirm my mom &apos;s call time .
maybe she got you in ?
why , to raise my social status
so i &apos;ll be a more suitable suitor ?
actually , that sounds completely like her .
and you would usually find that repellent ,
except you don &apos;t ,
because you like her .
does serena know ?
it was one kiss . there &apos;s nothing to know yet .
just ... be--be careful ?
and--and--and ,
and wear a nice suit . i have to go .
hello ? yeah , this is eric .
what ? no ,
i didn &apos;t know i was expected at the photo shoot .
you &apos;re late .
and you &apos;re glowing .
why make me bring overnight bag ,
and including la perlas .
because ... i &apos;m going to tell
that certain someone my true feelings tonight ,
and if everything goes as i hope ,
i don &apos;t wanna be caught in
last year &apos;s chantelle .
i don &apos;t think dan humphrey will know difference .
dan humphrey ? what are you talking about ?
the reason you take to bed .
shame from emotional affair with lowley boy .
it &apos;s lonely boy , and it wasn &apos;t an affair--
just a kiss ,
which made me see how much i wished it was with chuck .
mr. chuck ?
but your power play go kaput .
thank you for reminding me .
look , i wanted to realize my full potential
before joining forces with a powerful man ,
but chuck has matured past games and fatwas .
i believe we can build our futures together .
and if chuck is destined to be my prince ,
why kiss any more toads ?
humphrey more labrador than toad .
who cares what beast dan humphrey is ?
chuck is on his way .
i &apos;m gonna tell him i &apos;m ready .
it &apos;s time .
they say that fortune favors the bold .
thanks .
serena .
look , i &apos;m sorry i left without saying good @-@ bye ,
but as much fun as i had , my mom is right .
you know , she sacrificed a lot to raise me the way
she thought was best .
i have to respect that .
well , she may not have sacrificed as much as you think .
but watch out for the bold @-@ faced lies
that come with fortune &apos;s favors .
hi . grandma , the book people called and told me
i had to come down here a.s.a.p.
oh ! are you eric van der woodsen ? all right .
we need to start setting up for you and your sister .
and are you dr. van der woodsen ?
no . uh , wh @-@ what &apos;s going on ?
uh , the revised portrait concept is william van der woodsen
and his two children .
what ? no , the whole point was to do this for my mom .
i think the point for will is to always do something for himself .
we have to fix this . you find william .
i &apos;ll make sure that lily &apos;s occupied .
and you ... say absolutely nothing to anybody until i tell you .
i &apos;ve been looking everywhere for you .
your office said you were--
i just needed some time to think .
about what ? what &apos;d your dad say ?
it wasn &apos;t my dad on the phone .
it was the people doing the &quot; modern royalty &quot; book .
they were calling for the same reason he was .
they want us in the book .
and ... you said no , of course .
yes .
but then they asked if i didn &apos;t want to pose with my father ,
why not ... take it with my mother ?
having to say it out loud this morning
made me realize if i &apos;m estranged from my dad ...
i really have no one .
blair . hey . uh ... i wanted to talk to you for a second ,
but i can see you &apos;ve got your hands full .
the landsburys had too much licorice . wh @-@ what &apos;s up ?
i &apos;m ready to get my photo taken .
for the &quot; up and comers &quot; section , you know ?
this isn &apos;t a photo shoot for a high school yearbook .
there is no &quot; up and comers &quot; section ,
and even if there were , i mean , let &apos;s face it , humphrey .
you still wouldn &apos;t make the cut .
tell me you didn &apos;t do this just to humiliate me .
what ? no . i don &apos;t even know what &quot; this &quot; is .
epperly called me and told me i was in the shoot .
what , you didn &apos;t--you didn &apos;t have anything to do with that ?
no , and i don &apos;t know why epperly would ...
oh , god .
it &apos;s chuck .
he knows .
ah , bellissima .
oh , you are so beautiful .
thank you for being here .
of course .
we &apos;ve been through so much together ,
and i let you down so many times ,
and here you are .
mom , don &apos;t start to cry right now .
you &apos;ll ruin your makeup . stop .
what have you done with my daughter ?
what are you talking about ?
charlie . she never made it to the hotel ,
and she doesn &apos;t know the city .
she &apos;s out there somewhere on her own .
ugh ! i knew it !
one day with you , and she &apos;s run away .
this is not a coincidence .
watch how you talk to my daughter .
she didn &apos;t run away because of me .
she ran away because i told her the truth about you .
you go around acting like we &apos;re monsters ,
yet you take money from grandma every month .
is that true ?
i &apos;m sorry , mom . i overheard them earlier .
the only reason she came here is because grandma paid her to .
i &apos;ll call charlie now and see if she &apos;ll tell me where she is .
of course mother paid you to be here .
i am so foolish to think that you would have come
because you cared .
lily ...
this was all you , wasn &apos;t it ? you had epperly hire me
and call dan and tell him that he was an--
an &quot; up and comer &quot; ? what the hell is your problem , man ?
you &apos;re trying to humiliate him ? what , is that it ?
i don &apos;t care about him one way or the other .
i just wanted you to see he &apos;s not part of this world .
i know you kissed him .
so ?
you and i are not dating .
and you kiss a lot of people .
you &apos;re not supposed to kiss him . he &apos;s humdrum humphrey .
epperly told me it was life @-@ changing .
because it made me realize i wanted to be with you .
dan and i both know it meant nothing--less than nothing .
right ?
yeah , that &apos;s right .
i was gonna tell you all about it tonight .
but that would have been a huge mistake .
dan humphrey may not be royalty ,
but at least he &apos;s not a child .
hey . lily in makeup yet ?
we know you switched the photo
from rhodes to van der woodsen .
i @-@ i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
sure you don &apos;t , but let me tell you .
having a picture with you and your kids
doesn &apos;t make you look like a real father .
back off , rufus .
look , there &apos;s just-- there &apos;s no photo without my mom .
of course there isn &apos;t .
i wouldn &apos;t wanna cut your mother out of anything .
it &apos;s over , will . just fix it before lily finds out .
finds out about what ?
finds out that , um ,
that i &apos;m not happy with my hair . it &apos;s too flat .
mother , your hair is enormous .
we &apos;re ready for the van der woodsen photo .
oh , it &apos;s the rhodes photo , and we &apos;re here .
okay , i couldn &apos;t find charlie .
what &apos;s going on ?
you gonna tell them what you did ?
no , because i didn &apos;t do it .
would everybody please take their places ?
does anyone want to be in this picture or in this family ?
i do .
cinderella finally showed up at the ball .
too bad it was canceled .
oh , thank god . are you all right ? you had me worried sick !
i &apos;m fine .
uh , this is only supposed to be
william van der woodsen and his two children .
what ? since when ?
yeah , i &apos;m sorry , lily .
the book never reinstated you ,
will did this instead .
dad ?
what &apos;s the point of telling the truth
if you &apos;re not gonna believe me anyway ?
i &apos;m gonna go get some air .
this looks like the dress diana wore the day after she became princess .
it is .
i wanted you to wear it in the photo with me .
i had no idea i could just ask .
it &apos;s not too late .
you don &apos;t have to be powerful on your own first .
we can build our futures together .
the saddest part is that i &apos;d come to the same conclusion .
but ... now that i know i &apos;m ready , i realize you &apos;re not .
what ?
and i thought that after everything you went through--
prague , eva , russell , that ...
maybe you &apos;d changed .
but who was i kidding ?
don &apos;t say that .
you have years before you &apos;re capable of a real relationship ,
if you ever will be .
i &apos;m sorry , chuck .
lily , i ... did not sabotage the photo shoot .
i hope that you realize that .
ohh . i &apos;m not even sure i care if you did .
i mean , let &apos;s face it .
me , cece , and carol all in the same room--
the night was doomed to be apocalyptic .
but the fact that my rebel sister
has been judging me all these years
when she was taking money from my mother--
that &apos;s a whole new spin .
remember when she moved to maui ,
dallas , and then downtown detroit ?
anywhere your mother wouldn &apos;t go ?
and now she lives on a houseboat .
and you live in a penthouse .
yeah , for now .
and then it &apos;s the big house .
lily ...
tonight was supposed to be a way to forget that .
listen , nobody knows what your sentence will be ,
and your family &apos;s here for you ,
even though they &apos;re screwed up and dance in silver leotards .
unitards , and they were gold .
thank you , william . you &apos;re right .
i just spoke to julia chaplin
and found out that benedikt taschen was traveling
and never got your message .
the van der woodsen photo was the editor &apos;s idea ,
and william had nothing to do with it .
well , if that &apos;s an apology , rufus , uh , i accept .
come on . let &apos;s , uh ...
go get our family and go home .
i had no idea .
i know .
nice suit , though .
thanks .
uh ... what did you want to talk to me about earlier ?
oh , i just wanted to make sure you knew that
that kiss meant nothing to me
like it did to you .
oh . right .
social experiment gone wrong .
a princess kissing a labrador .
uh , i appreciate you not calling me a toad .
uh ... blair , your prince is out there waiting for you .
it might not be me or chuck ,
but ... he &apos;s out there .
your princess is , too ,
if you &apos;re ready for her .
all these years , all you did was lie to me .
i made some mistakes , but i was trying to protect you .
how , by secretly taking money ?
by making me feel horrible about who my relatives were ?
i &apos;m not 8 , mom .
i &apos;m 18 . i don &apos;t need to be protected .
i only wanted what was best for you .
you mean what &apos;s best for you .
well , that ends tonight .
charlie , don &apos;t .
so ... epic betrayal by mom ,
aborted photo shoot , no place to sleep .
what would serena van der woodsen do ?
well , the salted caramel gelato at il laboratorio
can end wars .
take me there .
did someone say &quot; gelato &quot; ?
oh , blair , this is my cousin , charlie rhodes .
hi . the blair . i &apos;m honored .
and i &apos;m craving vanilla pecan and a girls &apos; night .
let &apos;s get outta here .
come on .
poor lost prince .
what &apos;s the point of having a kingdom
if you have to reign alone ?
still no word on the sentencing ?
uh , no , not yet . um ...
did you know that martha wtewart taught crafts in prison ?
the flight &apos;s in a few hours .
i hope we hear by then .
and ... i hope
that charlie speaks to me on the plane .
serena said they had a great girls &apos; night .
probably just what she needed--
in light of , you know ,
your decades of massive hypocrisy .
i so wanted you to think i was different ,
that i &apos;d gotten out .
oh , when you left l.a. , i had ...
i had no one .
and then one day , i was 24,
living out of my car ,
buying a pregnancy test
at that drugstore up on laurel .
everything changed .
i did not want mom &apos;s help ,
but it wasn &apos;t about me anymore .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
and have you find out i failed ?
after you rejected me and everything i stood for ?
no way !
i did not reject you .
all i ever wanted was your approval .
well , you got it now .
turning yourself in ,
not giving a damn what people think--that &apos;s my lily .
will you come visit me in prison ?
i will smuggle you pot brownies .
so have you thought about what you &apos;re gonna say to your mom yet ?
i figured it would just kind of come to me in the moment .
she &apos;s never gonna let me do it .
what is this &quot; let &quot; ? you &apos;re an adult .
you make your own decisions , and you say
that you hope that she supports you .
i &apos;m starting to realize why you &apos;re so scary to her .
you wanna get that ?
no .
so i know you don &apos;t want to hear from me ,
but i had to share .
dan humphrey kissed blair waldorf .
you can confront them . they &apos;ll deny it ,
but it &apos;s true . i overheard them myself ,
and believe me , if i was lying just to mess with you ,
it wouldn &apos;t be something as unbelievable as this .
i &apos;m surprised rufus is letting you be at the brunch table .
he &apos;s usually very territorial about his waffles .
your stepfather and i have come to an understanding .
besides , he &apos;s out on a mission right now .
well , i am intrigued and proud of both of you .
i know you &apos;re making this work for my sake .
oh , and here i thought you were doing it for me .
hey , mom .
hi , sweetheart .
how was the sleepover ?
it was good . it was ... so good ,
that , um ...
if it &apos;s okay with you , aunt lily ,
i @-@ i &apos;d like to stay in serena &apos;s old room ,
catch up with the family , make up for lost time .
oh , i think that &apos;s great , charlie .
charlie , that &apos;s a mistake .
what happened wasn &apos;t so long ago .
you &apos;re not ready for this .
i am .
because of you , i know who i am ,
and ... nothing &apos;s gonna change that .
and thanks for supporting me .
why don &apos;t i show you your new room ?
my god . i suck at that .
you &apos;ll get better with practice .
what ? she &apos;s gonna be fine . we &apos;ll take good care of her--
you don &apos;t understand . a few months ago ,
she left college because ...
wh @-@ what &apos;s going on , carol ?
just promise me that you will make sure
someone watches her closely , okay ?
i promise .
hey , you &apos;re awake .
i &apos;m not sure if i ever fell asleep .
you , uh ... still thinking about your mom ?
yes , but not for the reason you think .
my dad always said she never tried to contact us .
but i can &apos;t help but wonder
since he lied about so much other stuff--
maybe he lied about her , too .
you could find out for sure , you know .
you could look for her .
walking down the primrose path ,
you risk finding hell instead of
happily ever after .
save me a waffle , but first we have a surprise .
you &apos;re socializing with my mother ?
that is surprising .
rufus has gathered the family , darling .
the whole family , because we are having a family photo .
lily , i assume you know laurie simmons ?
so great .
hi . uh , this is a family portrait ,
so i &apos;m assuming you are cousin charlie .
yeah . hi .
you &apos;re dan ?
how long you gonna be here ?
depends , i guess .
okay , i &apos;m good to go if everyone else is .
ah , cece , come on . you &apos;re sitting next to me .
oh , how about if i &apos;m in the middle
between you and william ?
all right .
look at me .
lily , you want me to ...
oh , that &apos;s all right . um ... just let it ring .
i want my family photo to capture this moment .
that &apos;s my lily .
okay , say &quot; cheese . &quot;
as with any journey , who you travel with
can be more important than your destination .
why does love have to be so hard , dorota ?
all i ever wanted was a simple fairy tale .
kate middleton has it ,
and i have much shinier hair .
although she does have a better assortment of hats .
don &apos;t despair , miss blair .
destiny full of surprises .
you never know who you &apos;ll encounter along the way .
who knows ? maybe fairy tales come true after all .
