there &apos;s a vintage bookshop in town ...
that &apos;s a cover for a counterfeiting operation .
jerry , you might be onto something here , okay ?
but you can &apos;t be doing this .
you &apos;re a civilian .
thomas farrow is clean .
his business is legit .
this guy is counterfeiting money .
thank you , sir .
i &apos;m sure of it .
who is he ?
if he knows ,
we &apos;re gonna have to deal with that .
there &apos;s a listening device implanted in the spine .
i just need someone to walk into that store
and sell it for me .
my uncle recently passed away .
found this in his attic .
looks like it might be worth something .
you have yourself a deal .
hello , mr. ortega .
what are you doing here ?
returning your book .
did you ever read it ?
there &apos;s a passage in here that warns of the perils
of meddling in someone else &apos;s affairs .
&quot; he who does will face retribution . &quot;
10月31日 下午3 : 02
trick or treat .
where &apos;s the enthusiasm , kids ?
better get those sugar levels up .
is , is that blood ?
that .
i was just carving up the corpse of a man i recently murdered .
corn syrup .
red food coloring and just a pinch of flour .
that , children , is the secret to realistic fake blood .
happy halloween .
that was weird ...
right .
where were we ?
okay , message delivered .
i won &apos;t say a word about anything .
just , please , stop hurting him !
such compassion . but you see ,
while you were just following your natural curiosity ,
my associate here failed to do his job .
which was to protect our interests from prying eyes .
well , consider my prying eyes diverted .
look , i get it .
you just want to run
your nice friendly counterfeiting operation
out of your antiquarian bookshop .
we all have hobbies .
exactly !
ours just happen to intersect .
excuse me one moment .
oh , my god , you killed him ! why would you do that ? !
please don &apos;t .
now , i want to know everything you told steve mcgarrett .
flight landed hours ago .
i swung by your place , tried calling you a bunch .
yeah , i didn &apos;t feel like , uh , going home yet , you know ?
yeah , i figured .
i figured , then i remembered you telling me about this place .
said it was a special spot for you .
how are your folks holding up ?
you know , my mom &apos;s , uh ,
just walking around the house ,
like a zombie--
she ain &apos;t put two words together .
my dad , he &apos;s ...
uh , putting on a @-@ a brave face .
how you doing ?
all right .
you know , it &apos;s not your fault , dan .
i don &apos;t know about that .
the coroner told us matt was dead
before marco even got to the island .
matty . matthew williams ! hey !
i think about it like this :
three years ago ,
if i didn &apos;t let my brother get on that plane ,
right now , he &apos;s sitting in jail ,
not in the ground , right ? so ...
what are you doing ?
don &apos;t do that , man .
don &apos;t do that .
it &apos;s true ...
don &apos;t do that , man .
it &apos;s true .
what , are you gonna second @-@ guess every decision you make ?
i did that with my old man , danny .
i did that with freddie , too .
the truth is i could never have saved either of them .
don &apos;t do that to yourself .
your kids trick @-@ or @-@ treating tonight ?
火奴鲁鲁
well , samantha &apos;s a little old for it ,
and after what she went through , you know ,
she still likes to stay close to home .
but the boy--
might as well be the super bowl tonight .
been gearing up for it for weeks .
i paid $ 50 just for his costume alone .
he &apos;s only gonna wear it once .
all this for a pile of candy
we &apos;re only gonna throw in the trash .
come on , now , be honest .
all that candy doesn &apos;t get thrown away .
well , the house gets its rake .
but , uh , mostly twix .
gentlemen , the good news is
our homicide victim is well @-@ preserved .
the bad news-- it &apos;s below zero in there ..
you know what we call below zero in chicago ?
april .
henry chun , manager of the restaurant .
kitchen staff showed up for work and found him like this .
uh , the safe and the register were both untouched .
the same can &apos;t be said about the victim &apos;s tongue .
max , get that thing out of my face .
oh , forgive me .
the clean cut suggests that the tongue was removed post @-@ mortem .
the victim likely bled out from the multiple stab wounds
to the chest and the abdomen .
i counted at least 17 of them .
all right , well , let &apos;s have csu collect
all the knives in the place ,
see if one of them comes back as our murder weapon .
okay , stabbing someone 17 times .
it &apos;s possible our killer got caught up in the moment .
but cutting out the tongue , that &apos;s about sending a message .
so , maybe our vic runs his mouth off
about something and it gets him killed .
well , we find out what that something is ,
we find our killer .
a motorist found him wandering the streets up in waimanalo .
he was dehydrated and disoriented .
said he &apos;d talk only to five @-@ o.
all right ...
jerry , just take your time and tell us what happened .
when i got home , farrow was waiting for me .
wait a minute , farrow--
farrow the bookshop owner that you were surveilling ?
he put one of those guantanamo hoods on my head .
and took me to a house somewhere and was questioning me .
kind of like marathon man ,
but without the dental abuse .
and instead of torturing me , he was beating on this other guy .
what , uh , what other guy ? who is he ?
i don &apos;t know his name , but he &apos;s in on the counterfeiting .
or he was .
what do you mean &quot; he was &quot; ?
farrow killed him right in front of me .
it &apos;s all my fault .
wait , why would farrow kill his own man ?
for letting me get too close .
please don &apos;t !
i want to know everything you told steve mcgarrett .
i told him everything !
he didn &apos;t believe me , even told me to stop spying on you !
if i had told him the truth from the beginning ,
that guy would still be alive .
what have i told you from the beginning , jerry ?
i told you to back off .
what were you thinking ?
i don &apos;t know .
that i was right , and you were wrong .
look , i only did it for a couple weeks .
farrow must have found out ,
and grabbed me to see what i know .
but he slipped up .
that doesn &apos;t change anything .
that money still leaves the island tonight .
okay , jerry , um ... that doesn &apos;t make sense .
i &apos;m sorry .
if this guy had a plan to move that money tonight ,
why would he , why would he just let you go ?
i don &apos;t know .
he &apos;s a criminal mastermind .
but you can bet he has a plan .
look , i know it sounds crazy .
and i &apos;m sorry i went behind your back .
but i &apos;m telling you the truth , and i can prove it .
jerry , tell me the , uh , the movers already came
and picked up your stuff .
no , they &apos;re not coming till next week .
this was farrow .
he took everything-- my files , my backups ,
my backups of my backups ...
well , you must have backups someplace else .
no , all my backups were here .
this was my life &apos;s work .
you had hours of recorded conversations ,
surveillance photos .
that &apos;s what farrow was doing .
you know that , right ?
he &apos;s destroying everything you had on him .
so , you believe me ?
yeah .
i , um ... tbd .
that &apos;s good enough for me . now , can we go arrest this guy ?
whatever happened to &quot; immunity and means &quot; ?
since when does five @-@ o need a warrant ?
since you decided to conduct
your own illegal surveillance operation , jerry .
oh , right .
good point ; that was my bad .
we want to protect you , okay ?
if you &apos;re wrong , you could go to jail .
so , when we get in there ,
just let me do the talking , all right ?
copy that .
i &apos;m sorry , i just ...
i don &apos;t see how any judge is gonna sign off on a warrant .
&quot; recent and reliable information , &quot;
that &apos;s the criteria .
you have the &quot; recent , &quot;
but i &apos;m not so sure about the &quot; reliable &quot; part .
what are you saying ?
you &apos;re a self @-@ published conspiracy theorist
who was breaking the law .
hey , i am reliable .
i helped five @-@ o find the black unicorn .
excuse me ?
what &apos;d i just say ?
outside , about not talking ?
what &apos;d i say about not talking ?
listen , i know it &apos;s a lot to ask , ellie ,
but if i had another option , i wouldn &apos;t be here .
okay , look , it &apos;s a long shot ,
but i &apos;ll give it a try &apos; cause i owe you one .
thank you , that &apos;s all i &apos;m asking .
thank you .
all right , thanks , duke .
hpd ran our vic , henry chun .
no criminal record ,
and according to friends and family ,
he wasn &apos;t having trouble with anyone .
that they know of .
somebody really went out of their way
to kill this guy in brutal fashion .
that &apos;s a real nice costume you got there , doc .
you know , my son &apos;s going as a ninja turtle .
he &apos;s 12 .
don &apos;t mind him , max .
look , every halloween , max dresses up as
a character from a keanu reaves movie .
except i wouldn &apos;t say the replacements is his strongest work .
if you were well @-@ versed , in the keanu oeuvre ,
you &apos;d know that nine was the number worn
by the character johnny utah
from the 1991 masterpiece , point break .
i &apos;m gonna give you a tip .
if you have to explain your halloween costume to someone ,
it &apos;s probably not a good costume .
okay , uh ...
max , so , what do you have for us ?
well , i can safely say that
our murder weapon wasn &apos;t among the knives
collected from the restaurant .
my autopsy shows that the stab wounds were inflicted
by a uniquely curved blade .
in fact , it is of my opinion ,
that our murder weapon isn &apos;t a knife at all .
i believe it &apos;s a sickle .
what kind of a maniac uses a weapon
like that mutilate and kill someone ?
i &apos;m thinking maybe it &apos;s not a coincidence
this thing happened on halloween .
it &apos;s eddie ...
quist .
hey , give me some good news .
sorry , struck out .
what &apos;d the judge say ?
i don &apos;t know if he was more surprised
by the actual warrant request ,
or the fact that you even asked for one .
apparently , five @-@ o has a reputation for being gung ho cowboys .
his words .
it &apos;s , uh ...
it &apos;s gross exaggerated .
well , maybe so ,
but i threw every legal precedent at the guy ,
and he wouldn &apos;t budge .
i &apos;m sorry i couldn &apos;t come through .
all right . thanks , ellie , i appreciate it .
well ?
we &apos;re good to go .
stay put , jer .
really ? we &apos;re good to go ?
i believe jerry , that &apos;s all the probable cause i need .
hey , five @-@ o.
hey , what are you doing ?
on your knees .
hands behind your head . hands behind your head !
get on your knees !
right now , hands behind your head .
and lock your fingers .
what the bloody hell is going on ?
shut up , don &apos;t move .
where were you this afternoon ?
what ?
where were you this afternoon ?
i was here , handing out candy .
it &apos;s what you do at halloween .
anybody back that up ?
i don &apos;t know , try every kid in the neighborhood .
look , would you mind telling me
what the bloody hell is going on ?
get up .
up . up .
you &apos;ve been accused of kidnapping and murder .
by who ?
me !
yeah , this is where he held me .
and that room back there is where he shot the guy .
what ... ?
what ... i don &apos;t know who this man is ,
but he &apos;s clearly deranged .
i &apos;ve never seen him before in my life .
he &apos;s lying .
bring in the crime @-@ lab guys ,
tear this place apart .
there &apos;s got to be evidence here .
presume you have a search warrant .
hell , yeah , we do .
show him , mcgarrett .
turn around .
sorry for the misunderstanding , mr. farrow .
we &apos;ll be on our way now .
let &apos;s go , jerry .
wait , we &apos;re just leaving ?
let &apos;s go .
you have a lovely home .
hey , duke , it &apos;s mcgarrett .
i need a full surveillance package .
subject &apos;s name is thomas farrow .
i want a unit on him 24 @-@ 7,
and i want updates on any and all activity .
all right , thank you .
wait , what &apos;s going on ?
yes , what is going on , steve ?
he had what looked to me like a shrapnel scar on his arm .
the type i &apos;ve only ever seen in battle .
but hpd background check didn &apos;t mention anything
about military service .
that &apos;s right .
i don &apos;t think thomas farrow is who he says he is .
okay , first a tongue , now eyes .
i &apos;m gonna go out on a limb
and say these two murders are connected .
which means we have a serial killer
with a lot more body parts to choose from .
all right , we need to get in touch with the fbi .
see if they &apos;ve got anything matching this killer &apos;s mo .
might not be the first time .
max , what &apos;s wrong ?
i know who our killer is .
last halloween , something terrible happened ...
it started as a prank ...
and ended in murder .
they thought they could bury the past ...
but this halloween ,
they &apos;re going to learn--
evil begets evil !
allow me to introduce you to our killer-- jack knife .
released in 1984,
it was originally panned by critics
as a pale knockoff of john carpenter &apos;s halloween .
however , in recent years ,
it is enjoying a well @-@ deserved , rabid cult following from ...
would you stop with the film @-@ school lecture
and just let us see the rest of it .
fine .
but pay very close attention .
the next part may look familiar .
tad ?
i thought you could use an extra hand .
tongue cut out , killed with a sickle and strung up .
it &apos;s just like our first vic , henry chun .
okay , so , we have a copycat killer
who &apos;s reenacting scenes from this movie .
what &apos;s the body count in this thing , doc ?
surprisingly , only three .
however , jack knife took a token from each kill .
first the tongue , then his eyes ;
the last victim loses his ears .
&quot; see no evil , hear no evil , speak no evil . &quot;
great , now our killer &apos;s gonna be looking for someone else .
okay , but ... i mean , why now ?
this movie &apos;s 30 years old .
not to mention , very difficult to get a hold of .
i had to employ my superior ebay skills
to procure this bootleg vhs copy from japan .
okay , the fact that it &apos;s really rare might help us .
i &apos;m gonna go check online ,
see if there &apos;s been any recent sales .
all right , look ,
i @-@ i get the guy who sees top gun and wants to enlist ,
but what kind of lunatic sees a stupid slasher film
and then identifies with a pumpkin @-@ head killer ?
oh , i can field that one .
jack knife is one of the first anti @-@ heroes
to emerge from the slasher film genre .
freddy kruger , mike myers ,
麦克 · 梅尔斯 《 王牌大贱谍 》 主角扮演者
those were guys you ran away from .
but in this day and age , with all the bullying ,
modern audiences tend to sympathize with jack knife .
we are rooting for him to get his revenge .
so , our murders could be revenge killings .
if that &apos;s true , then our victims weren &apos;t chosen at random .
well , it &apos;s also worth noting
that they &apos;re both about the same age-- 48 .
all right , well , then we need to find out
what else they have in common .
if we can make a connection ,
it could help identify who our killer &apos;s targeting next .
okay , here &apos;s who thomas farrow is on paper :
educated at oxford ,
moved here from britain in 2012,
his business license shows
that he opened his bookshop two months later .
okay , so , in theory , uh ...
for two years , this guy has been running his bookshop
as a front to counterfeit cash .
why has it not showed up on the radar , yet ?
well , you heard mcgarrett , the guy &apos;s former military .
which means we could be dealing
with a highly skilled individual .
fluent in spycraft , capable of creating a ghost identity
that can withstand any background checks .
my money &apos;s on him being an mi @-@ 6 bad @-@ ass .
that &apos;s british secret intelligence service .
i know . i &apos;ve seen james bond .
all right .
interpol came up empty on farrow .
what about the brits ?
i sent his photo to their ministry of defense .
they said they &apos;d run it up the chain but it may take some time .
and you bought that ?
it &apos;s 2014 , any kid with a cell phone
can do a facial rec and i.d.
they &apos;re stalling .
wait a minute-- if farrow &apos;s government knows
that he was , uh , counterfeiting cash on u.s. soil ,
maybe they &apos;re not so eager to claim him .
true .
hey , can you guys manage here without me ?
no .
well , you &apos;re gonna have to .
i have a british source .
he &apos;s kind of my one @-@ stop @-@ shop for all brit @-@ related intel .
we also watch doctor who together .
okay , look , i @-@ i , i @-@ i love the guy .
i do .
i think he &apos;s fantastic .
and i &apos;d like to believe him , but we have nothing .
we have no body , we have no counterfeit money .
now , look , jerry &apos;s eccentric , danny , but he &apos;s not crazy .
i mean , why would farrow even be interested in jerry
if he didn &apos;t think he was on to something ?
by that same rationale ,
why would he let him go if he was moving that money tonight ?
unless that &apos;s his plan .
he knew jerry would come back and tell us everything , right ?
maybe he &apos;s waiting to see how we would react .
so , what , we just wait--
sit back and wait and see what happens ?
hold on .
duke .
all right , put a unit on him , we &apos;re on the way .
right on cue .
farrow loaded up the van , he &apos;s headed to the airport .
夏威夷空运货物
step away from the vehicle .
step forward , and get on your knees .
on your knees right now , put your hands behind your head .
that &apos;s right , and lock your fingers .
hands behind your back , let &apos;s go .
keep &apos; em there .
steve , we got nothing but old books here .
he played us .
all right , here she is ,
in all of her mint , first @-@ edition glory .
bought her off a collector in texas a few months back .
had to throw in a 5.1 dune laser disk to close the deal .
which was cool , &apos; cause , i mean , i have , like , six of them .
where were you this afternoon ?
uh , here .
halloween &apos;s one of my busiest days of the year . why ?
you rent that movie out to anybody lately ?
does this look like blockbuster to you ?
no , it doesn &apos;t , because those don &apos;t exist .
all my items are pay @-@ to @-@ play .
although , i do hold free monthly screenings .
jack knife kicked off
my halloween slash @-@ a @-@ thon two weeks ago .
it was a big hit . sold a bunch of t @-@ shirts and replica masks .
okay , we &apos;re gonna need to have the names of
everyone who attended this screening .
good luck . i don &apos;t even know who was there .
i just blasted an invite to everyone on our mailing list .
it &apos;s over a thousand e @-@ mail addresses .
yeah , well , go back there and blast us out a copy of it there ,
blockbuster .
i &apos;ll see what i can do .
all right , our suspect pool just exploded .
yeah , but the timing does seem right .
this screening a couple weeks ago--
now we got bodies dropping .
yeah . someone left that screening just a little too inspired .
ugh . what is the appeal ?
i don &apos;t , i don &apos;t get the appeal to @-@ to horror movies .
what is that ?
what ?
nothin &apos; .
oh , not nothin &apos; .
you got something to say-- why don &apos;t you just say it ?
look , you &apos;re a big , strong guy ,
and you &apos;re afraid of horror movies .
that &apos;s no judgment , no judgment .
i don &apos;t watch &apos; em ,
because they insult my intelligence .
all these stupid people and they do stupid stuff
and go in stupid rooms ,
and then they end up getting killed in the worst
possible way imaginable ?
let &apos;s say i hear a noise in my garage .
i get my pistol . end of movie .
all right , here are those e @-@ mails .
okay , great .
found something else in the back , too .
this is for you , big guy .
take one home to your kids .
wait , stop .
you don &apos;t want this ?
keep walking .
blast from the past .
what you doing with these , brah ?
i have two homicide victims ,
and it turns out you went to high school with both of them .
they were a couple years ahead of you-- uh ,
henry chun and mark lerner .
damn !
sure , i remember those guys .
what happened ?
we &apos;re still trying to figure that out .
what can you tell me about them ? were they friends ?
they were tight--
they used to go surfing together all the time .
they had a rep for being tough guys--
as much as that means in high school .
you saying they were bullies ?
mm @-@ hmm . strong preying on the weak .
but they knew better-- they never liked to mess with me .
all right , who did they mess with ?
anyone stand out ?
maybe somebody that they targeted more than the others ?
the way i remember it ...
they were equal @-@ opportunity haters .
and chun and lerner ,
they wasn &apos;t even the worst of the bunch .
this kid they ran with ,
brad weiss , he was the ringleader ,
he was the vicious one .
mahalo .
brother , you think weiss did those murders ?
no , i think he &apos;s our next victim .
mr. weiss ,
this is the honolulu police department .
you have to call us back right away .
gps on weiss &apos;s phone shows he &apos;s at his house ,
but dispatch can &apos;t get ahold of him-
i &apos;m on my way .
kono and i are right behind you .
i want this perimeter locked down !
nobody in or out !
guys ! out back !
i &apos;ll check the perimeter .
i got a pulse .
i need emt &apos;s at the back of the house !
damn it .
he &apos;s gone .
where &apos;s the money ?
payment for those books was made weeks ago .
i was just delivering them to the buyer .
let me ask you a question :
do you enjoy this game you &apos;re playing ?
obviously not .
i &apos;m tied to a chair in a windowless room
with no cameras , and i haven &apos;t the faintest idea why .
yeah , you do . sure you do . you know exactly why .
no , i don &apos;t .
you went to my home with no warrant ,
you make fictitious claims of kidnapping and murder ,
and then you arrest me for conducting legitimate business .
that &apos;s harassment .
you have nothing to hold me on .
actually , we do--
you failed to fill out form 7501,
authorizing the exportation of commercial goods .
a technicality usually handled by u.s. customs .
right , but they &apos;re swamped right now ,
so we &apos;re gonna hold the shipment
and we &apos;re gonna hold you until
they can send somebody down to straighten that out ,
it &apos;s probably gonna take a little while .
meanwhile ,
your men are busy searching my home and place of business
to find evidence of a crime i didn &apos;t commit .
i &apos;ve read my fair share of detective novels .
well , that &apos;s good-- &apos; cause you know how this ends .
sad , really .
smart man like yourself ...
willing to risk his entire career
to indulge the ramblings of a crazy person .
that &apos;s a nasty scar .
how &apos;d you get it ?
automobile accident .
german book buyer is legit .
he &apos;s been in business for over 20 years .
okay . so that whole exchange was a setup .
he was just testing to see if we were watching him
and we took the bait .
here &apos;s the thing-- i think we might be too late .
all right , hpd went to the bookshop ,
tore the place apart , found nothing about counterfeit money .
might have unloaded it already , he might have , i don &apos;t know ,
set it in fire .
fine . we go after him for the murder .
i don &apos;t care how good you are , you kill somebody ,
you &apos;re gonna leave some evidence .
all right , well , i spoke to fong .
csu &apos;s processing the house now .
you know , fong better give me something soon ,
i can &apos;t hold this guy forever .
uh , one more thing you have a visitor .
hello .
i hope it &apos;s not a bad time .
detective williams said that you weren &apos;t busy--
he insisted i wait .
did he ?
yeah , she was saying , uh ,
this guy was really nice and polite and that he was a gentleman--
i wanted to make sure we &apos;re talking about
the same steve mcgarrett , so ...
oh , that &apos;s funny .
so , twice in one day-- what , you wanted to come see
where us gung @-@ ho cowboys work ?
look , about that ,
i &apos;m sorry i couldn &apos;t get your warrant .
especially after everything you did for me .
aw , ellie , you don &apos;t owe me anything .
anyway , i @-@ i thought you should know ,
after i requested the warrant , i got a bunch of calls .
apparently , thomas farrow was active in local politics .
he &apos;s donated money to half the judges on the island .
even worked on the governor &apos;s campaign ,
and was invited to the inauguration .
well , it &apos;s a good thing we didn &apos;t do anything stupid , then .
seriously ,
if you &apos;re going to proceed , you should tread carefully .
yeah , okay . thanks for the advice .
guess who hit the mother lode ?
jerry , hey ,
you remember deputy prosecutor clayton ?
you were saying ?
yeah , you know area 51 .
turns out there &apos;s an area 52 .
blows your mind , right ?
what did you do , steve ?
nothing you , uh , you would want to know about .
all right .
i &apos;ll show myself out .
what &apos;d you find on farrow ?
well , first of all-- spoiler alert--
his name &apos;s not farrow .
mr.weiss , we need to ask you a few questions .
henry chun and mark lerner are both dead .
ring a bell ?
yeah , they were killed by the same person who did this to you .
we think it was someone you went to high school with .
did you happen to get a good look at your attacker &apos;s face ?
no , he was wearing a mask-- but i know who it is .
sam cole .
this is all my fault .
when we were seniors in high school , we used to pick on sam .
but i took it too far .
what happened ?
that movie came out-- jack knife .
i thought it &apos;d be funny if we string sam up
like a scarecrow , you know , like in the movie .
henry and mark said no , but i talked them into it , and ...
so we beat him up and ... took his clothes
and ... left him there all night .
when we took him down in the morning , he was still crying , and ...
i said we &apos;d kill him if he told anybody ,
and he never did .
when was the last time you saw him ?
couple of years ago .
i go to get gas , he &apos;s working the register ,
and we do that thing where you pretend
like you don &apos;t know each other .
when he took my money , his hand was shaking .
well , see , nobody goes through
something like that without getting scars .
i was just a stupid kid .
i got an address on cole . let &apos;s go .
good news .
looks like you &apos;re gonna be going home soon .
ah . glad you &apos;ve finally come to your senses .
no apology necessary .
that &apos;s big of you .
anyway , after we process your extradition order ,
we &apos;ll hand you over to the british government
in a couple hours , okay ?
major william corrigan , right ?
former british special forces , court @-@ martialed
in 2004 for excessive force in combat ,
never showed up for the trial ;
instead , you disappeared .
and , uh , here you are ,
living in hawaii under a false identity ,
and counterfeiting money to stay afloat .
bravo , commander .
you &apos;re a murderer .
five innocent iraqis died as a direct result of your orders .
i &apos;m a soldier .
no , you &apos;re not .
you gave up that privilege when you crossed the line .
what line ?
warfare &apos;s messy .
it lives in the gray . always has .
my team had just cleared out a village of insurgents .
as our convoy was leaving ,
i spotted a hatchback approaching ,
wrong side of the road .
100 meters out , i had a decision to make .
so you lit it up , huh ?
a mother and her four kids .
i wasn &apos;t taking any chances with my men .
you didn &apos;t even fire a warning shot .
you &apos;ve led men in battle .
you know how it is--
you hesitate , they die .
was there collateral ? sure .
but all my boys made it back that day .
you never cared about your men ,
corrigan-- if you did ,
you wouldn &apos;t have killed this guy .
lieutenant colin helms .
what , was he collateral , too ?
what &apos;d you do with his body ?
you &apos;re nothing but a coward .
no .
the cowards
are the politicians who send us into battle ,
second @-@ guess every decision we make .
it &apos;s never their blood that &apos;s spilled though , is it ?
what do you got ?
okay , csu found blood trace in farrow &apos;s living room .
corrigan &apos;s living room .
what ?
farrow is corrigan . corrigan is farrow .
you know what i mean . just @-@ just get to the good part .
thank you .
anyway , it &apos;s not blood , okay ?
they ran tests . it &apos;s not blood . it &apos;s , uh ... it &apos;s corn syrup ,
red food coloring and flour .
they faked helms &apos;s murder .
all right , this was corrigan &apos;s plan all along .
right ? releasing jerry , the deal with the german .
he wanted us to focus on him
so helms was free to move that cash .
you got to hand it to the guy .
as far as distractions go ,
he &apos;s right up there with hans and simon gruber .
we gotta find helms before he makes that deal .
drop your weapon !
hands in the air . drop your weapon .
where &apos;s your father , aaron ?
when i came home with this ,
he told me the story .
i always knew he was weak .
pathetic .
finally understood why .
what did you do to your father ?
he &apos;s where he belongs .
aaron , what did you do ?
my father was smart .
he could &apos;ve done something with his life ,
before they ruined it .
and mine , too .
look around .
at school , i &apos;m the poor kid .
the one they laugh at .
this is what those guys did to me .
hey ... this is not like the movies .
if i shoot you , it won &apos;t be in the shoulder .
it &apos;ll be one shot .
center mass .
you &apos;re dead .
now that &apos;s how you end a horror movie .
guys , i think i got something .
take a look .
according to british intel ,
helms has ties to a radical ira splinter group .
the ira ?
i thought they died with the last
duran duran album .
well , apparently , they &apos;re making a comeback .
new faces . same ideology .
the ira .
not duran duran .
i got it .
but check this out : this freighter has been anchored
four miles offshore .
hasn &apos;t moved in hours .
tag numbers
show it being registered out of belfast , ireland .
why is a former british soldier doing business with the ira ?
corrigan thinks he was betrayed by his own government .
he &apos;s not counterfeiting for profit .
he &apos;s funding a war against his own country .
commander mcgarrett , target is five kilometers away .
you are green to engage .
roger that .
steve !
checkmate .
okay , now you can say , &quot; i told you so . &quot;
do i get a badge now ?
no .
come on , we got a sweet track record , you and i.
we &apos;ll see .
eric dickerson .
yes .
huge fan .
thank you .
huge fan . sir , you set
the all @-@ time single season rushing record in your second year .
i mean , that &apos;s ... it &apos;s insane .
30 years , still holding up .
a.p. came pretty close two years ago though .
you must have been sweating that out .
nah . would &apos;ve been good for the league , but--
between me and you--
yeah .
i love my record .
awesome . that &apos;s awesome .
hey , uh , what brings you to the island ?
the ono .
i come every fall for some fishing .
all right . i got to tell you ,
my buddy &apos;s a huge football fan .
he &apos;s gonna be pretty jealous when he learns that i met you .
let &apos;s take a picture and rub it in .
really ?
yeah .
man , this is cool .
all right .
you ready ?
eric dickerson .
you gotta be kidding me .
unbelievable .
nice technique .
casting is all about finesse .
you use brute force ,
like you did with yours , you don &apos;t get as far .
where &apos;d you learn how to fish ?
every summer we &apos;d visit family in australia .
dad would take me down to port phillip bay .
we &apos;d throw in a line and sit there for hours ,
just me and him .
whoa . okay , not too fast . you &apos;ll lose it .
watch and learn , mcgarrett .
all right ! look at that .
just like that , huh ?
what ? you thought i was all talk ?
no . i just ... you know , i just , uh ,
figured you &apos;d be , like , a catch @-@ and @-@ release @-@ type gal .
soft on fish violence and all that .
well , laugh it up .
&apos;cause you &apos;re gonna gut it , cook it and serve that fish to me
with an ice @-@ cold beer .
is that right ?
yep .
consider it your apology
for going behind my back on that warrant .
oh , right .
that , uh ... okay .
it &apos;s a deal .
now we &apos;re even .
all right .
