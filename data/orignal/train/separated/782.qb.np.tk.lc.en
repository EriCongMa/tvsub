yeah , yeah , totally . how &apos;d i get so lucky ?
my bro and my ho .
my penis-- it &apos;s gonna be exposed .
it &apos;s okay , just cover up .
okay , no , but i don &apos;t feel comfortable .
it &apos;s about schmidt .
okay , i &apos;m not involved in this at all .
hiding from the world .
you can &apos;t see me , i can &apos;t see you .
i know this sounds totally paranoid ,
but i think he &apos;s on drugs .
schmidt on drugs ?
okay , not getting involved starting now .
i &apos;m with nick here .
you remember how hard he took it when lance got busted .
美国职业自行车手 曾因服用违禁药品被抓
he just stared at that yellow bracelet and cried .
i know you &apos;re right , but ...
you &apos;re coming in ?
... it &apos;s just like he &apos;s had
this crazy energy lately .
and did you see how insane he was
when we were talking about the double date ?
also , he has just , like , stopped blinking .
is that whippits ?
well , nick can talk to him .
no , i &apos;m not gonna talk to him .
i called that i wasn &apos;t gonna be involved
those calls have to be respected .
if you talk to him , i &apos;ll give you a treat .
bedroom treat or kitchen treat ?
oh , i &apos;m just a country lawyer
and i have a very , very itchy bra .
well , perhaps i can get underneath .
i &apos;ve got worker &apos;s hands .
it &apos;s very itchy in so many different little places .
let me see .
you guys are being really , really gross right now .
i keep forgetting you &apos;re in here .
i think you made a really good point .
maybe he is just , like , really into me .
i mean , he has , like , stepped up his bed game a lot .
it is so not about him anymore .
that &apos;s disgusting . let me know when that treat &apos;s gonna happen .
and , cece , i &apos;m sorry about this , but i &apos;m gonna stand up
and you &apos;re gonna see my penis , and when i walk out ,
you &apos;re gonna see my butt . let &apos;s do this .
ah , excuse me , excuse me , excuse me .
sorry .
yeah , so that &apos;s glass .
that ain &apos;t no mint .
nope .
definitely glass , and i swallowed that ,
so you should consider , uh , a sign .
do you have a reservation ?
you know , it &apos;s funny that you would ask that
because , you know , i tried to call , like ,
20 times , and i couldn &apos;t get through ,
but , uh , i &apos;m looking for a reservation
for tonight around 8 : 00 p.m.
let &apos;s say , like , five people .
i have an 8 : 30 .
ah , kind of had our heart set on 8 : 00 .
seven weeks from now .
wait , what , what ? no , n @-@ n @-@ n @-@ n @-@ no .
look , there &apos;s got to be something that you can do .
well , you could try your luck at the community table .
community-- hell , no .
listen , um , sorry , you don &apos;t understand .
this has to be an official reservation .
no .
i &apos;ll tell you what , maybe this will
change ... your mind .
&quot; i owe you a hundred dollars . &quot;
oh , hell no .
no , that ... that was supposed to be a ten .
whoa , you got there faster than i thought .
hey , so this is weird and it &apos;s only gonna take
a second of your time , but , uh--
and i probably already know the answer ,
but are you on drugs ?
i know the answer is no , so i &apos;ll just see you later , man .
get in my room .
don &apos;t want to be part of it !
did you crack my e @-@ mail password ?
how did you guess &quot; smithereens &quot; ?
are you really on drugs ? talk to me , schmidt .
i &apos;m in way over my head , nick , i &apos;m doing something terrible .
well , what is it , man ?
you &apos;re going to get mad at me .
i &apos;m your best friend .
okay , i was there for you when you fell off the deck
at chester &apos;s graduation .
oh , no .
and i &apos;m here for you now .
there &apos;s nothing you could say that i &apos;d get mad at .
o @-@ okay , um , i can do this .
do you know how i broke up with elizabeth
so that i could start dating cece again ?
absolutely , and it was really hard for you .
yeah , that actually never happened .
what do you mean ?
i &apos;m still dating elizabeth .
what do you mean ?
i &apos;m dating both of them , and neither one of them knows it ,
and i feel terrible about it .
but elizabeth is gone .
what do you mean ?
she &apos;s not gone .
so you broke up with cece ...
i didn &apos;t break up with either one of them .
what do you mean ?
you process this however you need to process it .
if you want to keep talking it out ...
which one are you dating ?
both .
are you dating cece ?
i &apos;m dating cece .
are you dating elizabeth ?
yes .
how do you do that ?
they made me choose .
you have to choose .
you can &apos;t have both women .
what was i supposed to do ?
what , you think you can have a bunch of wives ? !
you got one wife !
this is the way the world works !
why ? !
i don &apos;t know .
i feel terrible about this , i don &apos;t know what to do .
how could you do this with jess &apos;s best friend ?
i don &apos;t know , i feel really badly about it !
in your little brain ,
how do you see this ending ?
i see it ending badly .
i see it ending very , very badly .
but you know what ? i just ...
i want to thank you , though ,
just for being there for me and for listening to me .
no .
i &apos;m not listening to you and i &apos;m not there for you .
because now we &apos;re in this together .
we &apos;re not in this together
and i &apos;m not listening and i &apos;m not being there ,
so just stop telling me things !
what would you like me to do with this information ?
well , it really helped me to tell you .
you should tell somebody , get it off your chest .
i can &apos;t .
you know what i mean ?
like ... who ?
well , certainly not jess .
don &apos;t ever tell jess .
the one person you can &apos;t tell is jess .

you are a lowlife .
i @-@ i get it .
how could you do this to her ?
jess , i am so sorry .
i made up a dance so everyone will be happy .
cece &apos;s gonna walk through that door any minute ,
and you have to tell her the truth .
jess , please , this would wreck her .
i &apos;m begging you .
i @-@ i know you don &apos;t believe me , but i do care about her .
either you tell her or i will , schmidt .
you &apos;re right .
i &apos;ll tell her .
yo , what it be ?
double date night !
what &apos;s , uh , what &apos;s going on ?
tell her .
tell her .
okay , okay .
we &apos;re taking two cars . it &apos;s faster that way because of gas .
no phones .
what ?
here you go . i got the door , it &apos;s okay .
go !
go !
cigarette , phone call , bathroom .
okay .
sir , you &apos;re clearly alone .
we &apos;re gonna need this table .
okay , so what do you think--
that over the past two hours ,
i , as a single person , have ordered eight separate entrees
and have taken bites of different sizes
of each of them to create some sort of pointless illusion ?
do you know how insane you sound ?
god , i hate this job .
you need to slow down .
i got it . don &apos;t worry .
what &apos;s going on , man ?
you guys were acting all so weird back there ,
and you &apos;re driving like a maniac .
oh , geez .
you know , i didn &apos;t want to have to say anything , but ...
what ?
here we go .
nick is cheating on jess ! aah !
what ? !
apparently , they met at some gas station .
she &apos;s much older . much , much older .
deeply korean .
i just found out .
and , i mean , nick is my best friend and all ,
but i can &apos;t even be in the same room as that scumbag right now !
oh , i &apos;m so mad ! i &apos;m just so , so mad !
i &apos;m terribly angry about the whole situation .
i can &apos;t even drive . take the wheel .
oh , why , god ? !
he was the best of us !
cece , please . you &apos;re veering everywhere .
sorry .
oh , nick , go , go !
we &apos;re gonna lose them !
you keep nerd @-@ stopping at every sign !
look , if i get another ticket ,
they &apos;re gonna make me wear eyeglasses .
why didn &apos;t you get involved back there ?
look , look , here &apos;s the reality .
yes , schmidt is my best friend ,
and he &apos;s also really scary .
you are so afraid of everything .
oh , really ? would a man afraid of everything
put his finger in a cigarette lighter ?
i don &apos;t know ...
don &apos;t do that . that &apos;s just stupid !
i &apos;m not gonna do that .
you wimp .
oh , my gosh !
oh , my god !
jess , are you okay ?
it really hurts .
oh , my lord , are ...
it &apos;s so hot !
come here . are you okay ?
yeah .
are you okay ? look , i &apos;m gonna do it .
why did you do that ?
so that we were both in the same amount of pain !
i &apos;m gonna junk @-@ punch him .
turn the car around . we &apos;re going to the restaurant .
why would you ... ? that seems rash .
maybe ... i don &apos;t know .
maybe staying away for a while ,
or at least-- i don &apos;t know-- talking about it ,
hearing his side . i don &apos;t ...
cheating is selfish , and it is cowardly ,
and there is no excuse for it .
the only thing that you can do
is punch it in the junk .
or you could really understand it
emotionally from their point of view .
you don &apos;t know . maybe they had a tough childhood .
turn the car around , schmidt .
maybe their mom &apos;s a lesbian .
i don &apos;t know .
turn the car around !
yeah , let &apos;s do it . let &apos;s turn the car around .
let &apos;s go to picca .
i &apos;m gonna turn the car around as soon as i turn this ...
turn the car around schmidt !
as soon as i turn the car around .
now !
as soon as i turn this car around ...
turn the car around , schmidt ! let &apos;s go !
and i &apos;m turning the car around . let &apos;s do it .
here we come .
what is he doing ?
i don &apos;t know .
looks like he lost a wing .
hey , jess .
yeah , fourth message .
just a friendly time update .
8 : 13 . hope to god you guys aren &apos;t bailing on me ,
or maybe you just lost track of time being couples !

but now it &apos;s time you do the right thing , schmidt .
i can &apos;t go in there .

cece .
you nipped the corner !
wait , cece . uh ... okay . i ...
cece , he &apos;s not ...
i lied to you . i ...
i &apos;ve been cheating on ... on you with elizabeth .
uh , i hate to do this right now ,
but if we don &apos;t sit , we will lose this table .
cece , i &apos;m sor ... i &apos;m sorry .
i don &apos;t ... i just ...
is there some place maybe we could , uh , go talk ?
everybody knows anyway , schmidt . might as well just say it .
oh , let &apos;s talk . let &apos;s ... we ...
this should be fine .
i didn &apos;t want to hurt you .
you have to know that
i did not want to hurt you .
please , i @-@ i &apos;m begging you .
if you take anything away from this ,
know that i did not want to hurt you .
i didn &apos;t want to hurt anyone .
especially you .
you have no idea
what you mean to me .
and i got caught up in this thing , and ...
i used to be so fat .
i mean , like ... truly gigantic .
i mean , as big as ... as big ... as big as it gets .
and now ... and now i &apos;m not , and girls like me , and i don &apos;t ...
i don &apos;t know how to do this .
i got lost .
and i &apos;m sorry .
you &apos;re sorry ?
you didn &apos;t want to hurt anybody ?
that &apos;s the best you can do , schmidt ?
really ?
i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t know you .
good @-@ bye , schmidt .
i &apos;m just realizing that i don &apos;t have any cash on me .
if anyone would be willing to loan me $ 12 for the valet ,
that would be ... greatly appreciated .
cece still hasn &apos;t called me .
do you think you could test my phone again ?
i can &apos;t . i don &apos;t have any more minutes .
minutes , nick ? !
who still has minutes on their phone ? !
i bought 10,000 minutes in 1999,
and i &apos;m still using them .
i &apos;m sorry . i just ...
i @-@ i really want to be there for her .
you are , okay ?
and she &apos;ll call , &apos; cause she needs you .
hell .
this is a real butt munch of a situation we &apos;re in .
yeah .
look ...
i &apos;m here for you .
there is nothing i know more than the fact
that i want to be with you , jess , okay ?
unless we &apos;re driving .
you admitted to driving while legally blind !
no , because you &apos;re honestly the worst backseat ...
you &apos;re honestly telling me what to do the entire time !
legally blind .
whoever has the wheel controls the car !
you liar !
here &apos;s your pie !
you broke my heart .
mail me my mouth guard .
in case you were wondering if
cece had elizabeth &apos;s number , sh @-@ she does .
so , tough time in schmidtsburg , wouldn &apos;t you say ?
just a quick heads @-@ up , nick , jess .
i blame you for this whole thing .
you can &apos;t seriously ...
i was going to fix it .
i wasn &apos;t going to hurt anyone .
but , since you took it upon yourself to hurt both of them ,
should it take me the rest of my life ,
i &apos;m going to break the two of you up .
bring it , schmidt .
it &apos;s impossible . we &apos;re really strong .
it will be when you least expect it ,
which might be when you most expect it .
could actually be when you &apos;re watching
the movie version of what to expect when you &apos;re expecting .
regardless ...
i ... am coming ...
for you .
oh , my god , schmidt is so scary . you were right .
we have to talk about the things
that he could use to pull us apart , okay ?
okay .
okay .
okay , politics .
you &apos;re a democrat , i &apos;ve never voted .
i &apos;m in the green party .
oh , that is so annoying .
okay , i have been banned for my lifetime from lake ontario .
don &apos;t ask .
okay .
what else do you have ?
my fear of pears .
okay , you &apos;re afraid of pears ?
and pear @-@ shaped people .
um , that &apos;s interesting .
i &apos;m not convinced i know how to read .
i &apos;ve just memorized a lot of words .
the doctors say i might grow another 18 inches .
that &apos;s a different image of you ,
but i &apos;m gonna get past that , and i &apos;m past it .
okay , the moon landing ...
... uh , which is obviously fake .
no , it &apos;s not obviously fake .
no , that &apos;s actually not what ...

the moon landing is definitely fake , by the way .
the moon landing &apos;s not ... what ? !
it &apos;s 100 % fake . the shadows are off .
no , they &apos;re not .
yes , they are .
i &apos;ve looked at photos on the internet , and it proves it .
nick , that &apos;s ...
the shadows are off , the shadows are off .
shadows are not ...
those photos are photoshopped .
that &apos;s not true .
people do that as a joke
to trick stupid people .
oh , yeah , you can just photoshop ...
no , that &apos;s ... wait a minute .
he &apos;s doing it already . he &apos;s getting in our heads .
unbelievable . good call .

i believe horses are from outer space .
