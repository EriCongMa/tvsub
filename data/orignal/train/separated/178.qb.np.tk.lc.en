gossip girl here
your one and the only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
i was willing to do what was necessary .
including lying to chuck .
i am k.c .. i am olivia &apos;s publicist .
i am actually looking for a job .
have you ever thought publicity ?
how could &apos; ve you never heard of olivia brook
that &quot; endless knights &quot; series ...
it &apos;s king arthur with vampires .
she plays guinevere .
my father turned his first profit by the time he was 22 .
i hope to do it by the time i &apos;m 21 .
the manager of the inn wants to meet you .
horace rogers , meet chuck bass .
man , come here .
constance is gonna be so different .
there &apos;s no more hierarchy , no more mean girls .
we &apos;re here to make sure you get
exactly what you want this year .
you need to be cold to be queen .
go make sure my spot &apos;s free at the met steps ,
and wait there with a yogurt for me .
all hallows &apos; eve ... the one day of the year
it &apos;s socially acceptable to play dress @-@ up .
the only question is ... who do you want to be ?
there are costumes to make men feel like boys again
or turn little girls into queens .
jenny , please let me go through this closet .
there &apos;s no room for your new things .
does this even fit you anymore ?
yes .
perfectly . all of it does .
we &apos;re 183 on travelocity ,
right behind the holiday inn laguardia .
who needs travel sites ,
with their huddled masses
searching the internet late night , trolling for deals ?
without those masses
i &apos;m at less than 20 % occupancy for the holidays .
that &apos;s why you should open the club .
once that &apos;s the place to be seen ,
you &apos;ll be so booked , you can turn away
the tasteless tourists in fanny packs .
i was thinking an &apos; 80s theme .
although shoulder pads can be overwhelming on my delicate frame .
this is a business , not a high school party .
i told you i was sorry for my little transgression ,
and you forgave me .
now either make me kiss a girl already
or let &apos;s move on .
i apologize . i &apos;ve been on edge lately .
with all my liquid assets tied up in this hotel ,
i have to make sure everything gets done right .
&quot; right &quot; for the chuck bass i know
means &quot; right now . &quot;
people think i &apos;m playing a game ,
and they want me to lose .
i have to prove i &apos;m not just bart bass &apos; son .
my impulsive tendencies have no place
in my life as a legitimate businessman .
well , you &apos;re very sexy when you &apos;re legitimate .
thank you .
i &apos;m late to meet my accountant .
you understand i have to do this my own way .
of course .
mark ? i want to book you for the opening of a new club .
all right , so i gotta ask .
did you bring it ?
yeah . i got it .
are you 100 % sure you want to do this ?
yeah , you know , i mean ,
olivia and i have been dating for a couple weeks now .
it &apos;s getting pretty serious at this point .
i &apos;ve waited so long , it &apos;s embarrassing .
yeah , sure , but once you go there , you can &apos;t go back .
believe me , i ... i know .
i know . i ... i ... i really think i &apos;m ready .
oh . enjoy , man .
six hours of pleasure .
so you really think the sight of olivia in fake fangs
reciting stilted dialogue is gonna be a deal breaker ,
don &apos;t you ? oh , the dialogue &apos;s awesome .
it &apos;s the , uh , it &apos;s the part without the talking .
that &apos;s the problem .
i think i can handle some pg @-@ 13 bloodsucking . come on .
seriously , man , do you not get internet here in brooklyn ?
okay . patrick roberts , who plays her vampire costar ,
was her boyfriend the whole time they were shooting this .
all the blogs said they got really into it
and started doing it for real ,
like sex tape on the cutting room floor real .
i think the most disturbing part in all this
is that you &apos;ve been reading &quot; endless knights &quot; blogs .
okay , that &apos;s ...
i know you think you &apos;re okay with it ,
but you don &apos;t want to watch your girlfriend
with another guy .
i mean , comparing looks and noises ...
no , see , that &apos;s the problem with your theory .
i don &apos;t ... i don &apos;t ... i have no idea if she makes noises yet .
we haven &apos;t gotten to the noises stage ,
although we , uh , we do have plans tomorrow night , so ...
hold on a second . maybe this is her .
spotted ... one star with her hand in the cookie jar .
even perez hilton knows our lonely boy
is going to be getting a halloween treat .
what the hell is this ?
it looks like olivia &apos;s picking up some free ...
i know what she &apos;s doing . i want to know why .
i assume it &apos;s because she wants to practice safe sex .
she shouldn &apos;t be practicing anything
without patrick roberts , who &apos;s in toronto on a movie .
this obviously means you didn &apos;t take care
of the dan humphrey situation like i asked you to .
it &apos;s not a situation .
it &apos;s a relationship .
they &apos;re very happy together .
well , since i &apos;m not a couples counselor ,
their happiness is irrelevant .
serena , without &quot; endless knights , &quot;
patrick is on the road to mark hamill @-@ hood .
is that the guy from &quot; star wars &quot; that &apos;s not harrison ford ?
not dating olivia is the nail
in patrick &apos;s culturally relevant coffin .
i &apos;m not being ironic about vampire movies .
i &apos;m sorry about patrick , but i told you ,
if you want dan and olivia to break up ,
that &apos;s something you &apos;re gonna have to do yourself .
look , olivia &apos;s trying to be a &quot; real &quot; girl
and not taking my calls ,
so i suggest you make yourself useful .
unless , of course , you see yourself delivering
james franco &apos;s underwear for the rest of your life .
he needs them by noon . i &apos;ll be in my office .
so rufus asked my size this morning .
does this mean i &apos;m getting a flannel ?
no . he &apos;s just a costume enthusiast .
oh . he likes halloween more than
he likes christmas and his birthday .
so we have to find a party , otherwise , i swear ,
he &apos;s gonna make us hand out candy ,
dressed as the octo @-@ babies .
uh , speaking of creepy social anomalies ...
the last time you handed her the yogurt ,
there was a spoonful missing .
hmm . time to get to work ruling the kingdom .
you look queen @-@ tastic . thank you .
and your yogurt with almonds .
it &apos;s all there . i checked .
are there skins on these almonds ?
fix it , and in a timely fashion ,
otherwise you &apos;re all going
as the &quot; real housewives of new jersey &quot; for halloween .
i mean , even if there are other dillingers at the parade ,
none of them will have
one of johnny &apos;s actual suits from the movie .
jenny , you should come to the village with us .
uh , yeah . what are you guys doing sitting up here ?
the birds decided to use our usual place as a restroom .
oh , gross .
um , do you guys mind moving down a couple steps ?
i &apos;m sorry , but you know
the whole &quot; no one &apos;s supposed to sit higher than me &quot; thing ,
and if the girls see you up here , they &apos;re gonna take it
as a sign of weakness and ...
we ... we get it .
you can &apos;t lead if no one thinks they have to follow . it &apos;s cool .
thank you . not you .
hello , &quot; invasion of the body snatchers . &quot;
looks like jenny , sounds like jenny ,
is really a dark , power @-@ hungry monster .
oh , come on . she &apos;s still the same jenny underneath .
she just has to wear the mask for school .
that mask is becoming her face .
is she actually levitating ?
uh , i &apos;m pretty sure that &apos;s green screen .
is their acting this good in the rest of the movie ?
i mean , just look at the way she &apos;s looking at him .
that &apos;s ... that &apos;s love . that &apos;s ... that &apos;s definitely love
and lust and , uh , and gratitude ...
dude , it &apos;s an orgasm . yeah .
i mean ...
it &apos;s completely understandable why you &apos;re freaking out .
no , i &apos;m not ... i &apos;m not freaking out .
i &apos;m just , you know , i &apos;m processing this things . yes .
yeah .
oh , it &apos;s olivia .
yeah , i know . i just ... i got this thing .
it &apos;s ... it &apos;s like a flu .
uh , can i call you in a couple days ?
okay . all right . bye .
mark ronson is on hold
and i left word for the mixologist from milk &amp; honey .
i thought chuck didn &apos;t want to
open his club till after the holidays .
well , that &apos;s what he says .
he also says he wants to do it his way ,
but that will change , just like it always does ,
when he sees my plan .
i don &apos;t know , b.
i tried to help carter , and that just drove him away .
the good news is k.c. &apos; s yelling at me all the time ,
and i don &apos;t have time to think about it .
oh , this is probably her calling now ,
seeing if there &apos;s enough chai in her chai latte .
hello .
are you along ?
chuck , hey .
am i alone ?
it &apos;s obviously about a gift .
serena ?
yes . hi . i &apos;m here . sorry .
hotels that don &apos;t book
over the holiday season don &apos;t make it to the next .
i &apos;m sorry . are you in trouble ?
do you want me to call my mom
to see if bass industries can help ?
i don &apos;t want bass help . i want a publicist .
okay , great .
um , well , i &apos;ll call cond√© nast and tablet hotels right away .
no . i no longer have time for
the establishment to accept me .
i need them to come begging .
i want to open my club tomorrow , halloween .
see ? my idea .
okay , tomorrow . absolutely .
and , serena ,
i don &apos;t want blair anywhere near this .
okay . bye .
i &apos;m sorry .
clearly , chuck hasn &apos;t forgiven you .
looks like someone &apos;s ghosts tricks past
have come back to haunt this halloween .
swifty , you &apos;re the man .
no problem .
everything looks good here , mr. bass .
thank you for moving so quickly .
i &apos;m glad everything &apos;s up to code .
up to code ? wow .
not words i &apos;d usually associate with chuck bass .
what can i tell you ? it &apos;s the dawning of the new age
moonshine martini .
with a call back to the old .
this is perfect .
thank you .
a speakeasy ...
what could be more timely ?
a place to escape the modern world
and violate its rules ... legality of course .
yeah , i &apos;m surprised blair isn &apos;t here .
what , are you guys in another fight ?
a fight implies time and energy .
it &apos;s more of an ongoing detached distrust .
i can &apos;t believe he chose you over me .
i &apos;m gonna ignore that because i know you &apos;re upset .
but , b. , can you please try to keep your voice down
the only way i can prove myself to k.c.
is if she doesn &apos;t find out about this party
until after i make it amazing .
she &apos;ll try to take it away
it &apos;s not like chuck hasn &apos;t kissed a guy before .
he said so himself .
did it ever occur to you that maybe it &apos;s not about the kiss .
your game is based on trust ,
and you broke his .
me ? what do you call him pretending he &apos;s not mad at me ?
that is the most untrustworthy thing i &apos;ve ever seen .
i &apos;m going to demand he let me help him .
blair , i know this is hard to hear ,
but maybe today is not about you .
chuck has 24 hours to create something from scratch .
his liquor license hasn &apos;t even cleared yet .
hi . no , i already faxed the permit
to control the sidewalk in front of gimlet .
yes .
i know chuck is anti @-@ everything bart bass ,
but his father must have had a better way
to get these things done .
have you even been listening to anything i &apos;ve been saying to you ?
yes . this is not about me .
it is about chuck .
so i &apos;m going home .
hey , lil . vanya has a package you need to sign for .
who would possibly send all this candy ?
this is not package . this is package .
this is for the trick @-@ or @-@ treaters .
oh , i had no idea you would get all of this
or i would have called you . charles invited us
to his club opening , and i want to go be supportive .
i &apos;m sure vanya would love to take all of this candy .
we &apos;re not going to that club opening .
but i already got costumes .
aren &apos;t you the one that keeps telling me ...
... i shouldn &apos;t embarrass the kids ?
well , that &apos;s when you wanted us all
to dress up like the ramones .
well , jenny would make a great joey .
this is a prohibition party ... classy , elegant .
there &apos;s nothing classy about being at a party with your parents .
we can dress up and pass out candy .
sorry about that , vanya .
sorry not to me .
sorry to mr. rufus when he sees no trick @-@ or @-@ treaters
come into this building .
i know . he just seems so happy .
i couldn &apos;t bear to take his candy away yet .
not bad , but it &apos;s prohibition ,
not &quot; last of the mohicans . &quot;
lose the feathers .
you seriously think that &apos;s the same jenny
who took the bus from brooklyn ?
if you don &apos;t believe me , just go talk to her about it .
i &apos;ve got a better idea .
did you make your own costume , jenny ?
no . it &apos;s vintage . gaultier .
no way .
what &apos;s your problem ? him .
no one &apos;s allowed to sit higher than you .
hey , jenny .
jonathan , you know you can &apos;t sit up here .
are you disobeying a direct order ?
sorry . the pigeons .
bird poop is not our problem .
you guys will have to sit somewhere else .
jenny , come on . what &apos;s ... what &apos;s gonna happen
if we hang out here for a couple of minutes ?
girls ?
wow . looks like you &apos;re feeling a lot better .
yeah , thank you .
um , yeah , it was , you know , it was just one of those ,
uh , 24 @-@ hour things . um , it was kind of weird .
dan .
if this is about that cookie jar photo ...
if you &apos;re not ready , i totally understand .
ready ? no . no .
i ... i love that picture of you . it &apos;s so flattering .
and who can resist free gifts
in , uh , in shiny wrappers ?
did you watch that ?
what ?
okay , so it &apos;s not about the cookie jar photo .
you think that i &apos;m a bad actress .
what ? no , no , no . i didn &apos;t ... i wouldn &apos;t say &quot; bad . &quot;
which scene was it ?
was it where i sucked that wolf man &apos;s blood ?
because that was a dummy wolf man ,
and it &apos;s really hard to play with a dummy .
so flu as a patrick roberts flu ?
look , he ... he made you levitate . dan .
that &apos;s all acting .
well , reigning blog opinion seems to be
that acting with your boyfriend , without your clothes on ...
it &apos;s , um , you know , it &apos;s a sex tape .
well , what the blogs don &apos;t know
is that patrick was never my boyfriend .
our whole relationship was strictly for publicity .
have i ever told you what a great actress you are ?
listen , i never had feelings for patrick like i do for you .
okay ? so can we please get back to somewhat normal ?
yeah . yeah . only if you promise to show me your free gifts .
well , we can explore all of my health center
acquisitions tonight , after chuck &apos;s club opening .
let me just let serena know that we &apos;re coming .
okay .
why is m.k. bringing two guests
to some gambling club opening ?
i @-@ i know you wanted me to make myself useful .
i &apos;m sorry . i @-@ i wanted to surprise you .
by stealing my client list ?
pack your things .
k.c. , wait . i @-@ i only did this because i was trying
to get olivia and patrick back together like you wanted .
olivia is coming tonight .
all you have to do is fly patrick in . look .
olivia &apos;s coming alone ?
yeah .
this better work .
i promise it will .
in the future ,
the only surprises i appreciate are cash and gifts .
ÊàëÂéªÊãø‰∏πÁöÑÊúçË£Ö
this is chuck bass again ,
regarding the status of my liquor license .
i look forward to hearing from you .
voice mail again , huh ?
with clubs closing all over the city ,
you &apos;d think it &apos;d be in their financial interest
to expedite things .
the only &quot; interests &quot; those people understand
comes in envelopes full of unmarked bills .
i seriously hope you &apos;re not thinking
about opening without a license .
no . i &apos;m considering what my father would do
in this situation .
i &apos;m trying to find a suitable alternative .
this is chuck bass .
mr. bass , frank bennett from the a.b.c ,
returning your call .
i wanted to let you know
your liquor license has been approved .
effective immediately ?
i &apos;ll deliver it myself later today .
thank you very much , mr. bennett .
you see that , horace ?
victory without deceit .
seems like little chuck ...
finally stepped out from big bad bart &apos;s shadow .
Ë¥©ÈÖíÊâßÁÖßÊêûÂÆö Êàë‰ª¨‰∏§‰∏çÁõ∏Ê¨†‰∫Ü
too bad his girlfriend &apos;s still playing on the dark side .
what do you think ?
does it really play without the other ramones ?
i was gonna do iggy ,
but i thought it might scare the children .
well , not that i don &apos;t enjoy you shirtless and in eyeliner ,
but i do think you made the right choice .
i just don &apos;t want you to get your hopes up too high .
i know the kids care more
about the candy than the costume ,
but i think they appreciate the effort .
rufus , i know this is important to you , but honestly ,
i can &apos;t remember the last time we had trick @-@ or @-@ treaters here .
that &apos;s because no one thinks you &apos;re home .
well , but this year i told them we &apos;d be here ,
and they all seemed pretty excited about it ,
except for that guy on six who never makes eye contact .
it &apos;s hard to tell what he &apos;s feeling .
oh , eric , my darling , are you sick ?
i &apos;m not sick .
then what are you doing home so early ?
did something happen ?
ask jenny .
i &apos;ll handle this one .
i @-@ i don &apos;t like the tickle .
dorota , when i get you a gift ,
the least you can do is to enjoy it .
oh , mr. chuck . my goodness .
when you are mad at ms. blair ,
dorota is very tired
and has to have the foot bothering
and never sees vanya or movies ...
dorota .
that will be enough for today .
—Å–ø–∞—Å–∏–±–æ
is it safe to assume this visit signals
the end of my community service hours ?
i wanted to apologize .
last week &apos;s incident took longer
than anticipated to move past .
but seeing as tonight &apos;s all about new beginnings ,
i wanted to put that behind us and make things right .
with gifts ?
i assume word reached you of
my club opening this evening .
it was never my intention to leave you out .
i just needed to create it on my own ,
as a legitimate businessman .
it &apos;s beautiful .
i love it .
good .
serena , tell dan that
he should be a musician , not a gangster .
you have no street cred .
i &apos;m offended .
you know , once in the fourth grade , i had to miss recess
&apos;cause i purposely broke the rules of grammar .
i think dan will look fine in whatever he wears .
serena van der woodsen
doesn &apos;t have an opinion on wardrobe .
that ... that ... this isn &apos;t right .
look , k.c. wants you guys to break up .
um , yeah , i know ,
and that &apos;s why i &apos;m not returning her phone calls .
did she seriously send you here to do that ?
no , i @-@ i didn &apos;t come because i want you guys to break up .
i @-@ i @-@ i came because i have found a compromise
that i think will get her off your backs and mine .
i hope it &apos;s firing k.c.
patrick is coming out for the gimlet opening tonight .
he &apos;s already on a plane .
i don &apos;t like where this is headed . i have a gun .
i can get k.c. the publicity bump she &apos;s looking for
if you &apos;re just willing to walk the red carpet with him ,
just act like you guys are still together .
well , no , right ? wh ...
it &apos;s one night .
uh , i &apos;ll do it .
okay .
dan , um , i &apos;ll ... i &apos;ll leave your name at the back door
so you guys can meet up after the cameras .
thank you .
yeah .
you want me to pretend that we &apos;re not together ?
no , it &apos;s just ... it &apos;s just for the cameras .
sometimes this is the way the business works .
well , our relationship isn &apos;t business .
i just don &apos;t understand why you would want
to go somewhere with your fake boyfriend
rather than your real one .
dan , i &apos;m sorry , and i hope you &apos;ll come
and meet me inside tonight .
i don &apos;t know why he &apos;s blaming me .
i didn &apos;t do anything .
i can &apos;t control every girl at school .
well , jenny , you and i both know that that &apos;s not true .
you may not have done the deed ,
but i suspect you gave the order .
he sat above me on the steps .
that must have put you in a very difficult position .
yeah , and he did it on purpose .
he knew that i &apos;d have no choice .
lily , please . my dad would never understand ,
and you know these girls .
i had to do something .
yes .
just like i have to do something now .
but you and dad already gave us permission
to go to chuck &apos;s tonight .
well , and you can ,
as long as eric still wants to go with you ,
and you make sure that all of your so @-@ called friends
apologize to him when he gets there .
fine .
horace , put this up behind the bar .
thank you for taking care of this so promptly .
it &apos;s my pleasure . i &apos;m always happy to help out jack bass .
are you ready to open the cornerstone of the new chuck bass empire ?
you decided this was the way to impress k.c. ?
what ? chuck , i would never call jack .
you might convince me more if you weren &apos;t
the only one who knew about the problem .
blair , blair , did you call jack ?
well , you have the liquor license .
what does it matter who called who to get it ?
jack ... is the last person i would call for help .
you &apos;re still mad from before . it &apos;s clouding your judgment .
this isn &apos;t about last week . it &apos;s about you , blair .
it &apos;s the reason why i couldn &apos;t say &quot; i love you . &quot;
it &apos;s not a game .
it &apos;s because i knew i couldn &apos;t trust you .
i did this because i love you .
be that as it may , i have a club to open ,
and you &apos;re no longer invited .
fine . s , come on . we &apos;re leaving .
blair , i &apos;m ... sorry .
i &apos;m gonna stay with chuck .
you &apos;re alone , nate ? what &apos;s wrong ?
you don &apos;t have any friends left to screw over ?
oh , well , at least i &apos;m on the list
and not working the door .
text me when patrick arrives .
all right .
i thought you said that this was an exclusive party .
eric &apos;s over there on the phone .
yeah , he ratted me out to our parents ,
so now i have to be nice to him ...
at least to his face .
sounds like you have a plan .
i do , and one that won &apos;t get me caught this time .
follow me .
it &apos;s a queen &apos;s job to protect her king .
chuck should be thanking me for making his club possible ,
not treating me like some useless pawn .
it &apos;s hard to love a powerful man .
you think i &apos;m trustworthy , don &apos;t you , dorota ?
of course , miss blair .
knight to queen 7 .
tell those pathetic trick @-@ or @-@ treaters
there &apos;s no prepackaged joy for them here .
thank you .
see ? i knew he would come to his senses .
i told you this wasn &apos;t my fault .
what does mr.chuck say ?
they &apos;re not from mr. chuck .
dress . now !
here you go , mr. policeman .
and here you go , mr. fireman ,
and , uh , lady gaga .
wow . you kids look terrific .
thank you . they &apos;re perfect .
come on kids , let &apos;s go . come on .
thank you .
happy halloween .
excuse me , man .
your powers of disguise have fallen off a bit .
i know you don &apos;t want to see me .
then what exactly are you doing here .
i have more important things to deal with
than your little surprise .
i came to apologize .
i was trying to help you . so you would see you needed me .
then we make a good team .
but you were right , not to trust me .
i ruined everything .
heartfelt . earnest .
let me guess , you found out .
the liquor license you so thoughtfully procured was fake .
you already knew ?
did jack send you condolence flowers , too ?
i don &apos;t need condolence flowers , i know jack bass .
if you know , then why is the club still open ?
if the cops show ...
you probably don &apos;t want to hear this , but ... i have an idea .
i already made the call .
i &apos;ll take care of the paparazzi .
blair , we still have things to discuss .
i know .
if you got it , you got it , right ?
you do not got it .
so you want to sit ?
i &apos;m sorry you have to sit down with my mom .
yeah .
no , she clearly has some experience in queendom .
well , i &apos;d take a run @-@ in at the step
if you overheard anything .
can we just agree not to say the word &quot; steps &quot; any more ?
i &apos;d like nothing better .
without jonathan here , i know no one .
yeah . me neither .
where are your handmaidens ?
happy halloween .
serena .
oh , patrick , hey . i &apos;m so glad you finally made it .
i &apos;m serena .
if i known what you look like ,
i would kept you on the phone longer when i called for k.c.
ok . enough with the chitchat .
where &apos;s olivia ? we need to get this picture .
i just saw her .
what the hell is he doing here ?
i &apos;m so happy that you are here .
i &apos;m not going down to a fake boyfriend without a fight .
come on .
it &apos;s not what it looks like .
let me just go and talk to them . chuck .
excuse me , serena .
these gentlemen are here to close down my club .
and the best costume award goes to new york &apos;s finest .
this party is a bust .
what do we got here ?
that &apos;s it , shut it down . let &apos;s move , people .
party &apos;s over . let &apos;s move , people .
let &apos;s go , you guys .
you gotta give me that drink right now .
chuck , you might want to try to stop the police .
why would i stop &apos; em ? i called &apos; em .
why would he have his own club raided ?
well , once we found out the liquor license was fake ,
we could either wait for jack to call a.b.c. to take us down
or we could take control and call the police
to blow up the party for a night that
no one would ever forget .
brilliant , isn &apos;t it ?
this was your idea ?
oh , it was both of ours .
you see , s , we belong together .
okay , well , k.c. blames this whole thing on me .
now i have to go get my clients out of here
before they get mug shots or tmz videos .
oh , you could try to go through the hotel .
thank you .
but there &apos;s probably paparazzi out there , too .
i &apos;m sorry , s. , but chuck &apos;s hotel needed this .
without your celebrities , we &apos;re buried in the city section .
now we &apos;re front page news .
why would you do this to me ?
you knew how important it was for me
to prove myself to k.c.
remember when you chose chuck ?
now i did , too .
bye . happy halloween .
what &apos;d i tell you , lil ? we just had to put the word out .
once these kids tell their friends ,
i &apos;ll bet we get at least a hundred next year .
a hundred ? rufus , i hope you don &apos;t ...
i &apos;m just teasing you . you got the perfect number .
how did you figure it out ?
well , after the third time i heard &quot; achoo , &quot;
i realized it wasn &apos;t a sneeze .
it &apos;s &quot; thank you &quot; in lithuanian .
plus , lady gaga forgot to change her hair
when she came back as taylor swift .
well , i just didn &apos;t want you
to feel you had to leave all your traditions in brooklyn .
and i love you for that .
but why don &apos;t we start some of our own traditions ?
how about some grownup trick @-@ or @-@ treating ?
all right , but i draw the line at door @-@ to @-@ door .
i was just thinking of one door .
you know , we , um ,
we should probably get out there eventually .
i know .
um , there &apos;s something that i ...
dan , um ,
patrick ... wasn &apos;t my fake boyfriend .
what ?
i know .
um , i lied because i @-@ i care about you .
and i did not want you to compare yourself
to some perfectly lit , heavily edited performance .
and ... and what about tonight ?
why get photographed with him ?
when i ended things with patrick ,
i @-@ i broke his heart .
and with no more &quot; endless knights &quot; movies ,
his career just kinda stalled .
you don &apos;t think it was because of the bruce jenner biopic ?
i mean , that was ...
dan , my plan was to tell him afterwards
that the only person i want to kiss here tonight is ... is you .
okay ?
okay .
you really need to work on your timing .
actually , my timing is perfect . follow me .
come on . i &apos;ll ... i &apos;ll explain . hurry .
okay .
sorry i interrupted . um ...
now is probably a good time to get that kiss .
ooh . i could use a real one before we go out there .
look , everyone . it &apos;s olivia burke
kissing her boyfriend dan humphrey .
are you okay with this ?
yeah .
olivia
if you &apos;re dating this guy ,
who &apos;s dating patrick roberts ?
yeah , how about that ?
i am .
you really proved yourself with this one , s.
looks like your work troubles have just turned into
a labor of love .
perez hilton drew tears on his own photo
because he wasn &apos;t there . have you heard from the hotel ?
blowing up the club
exploded our online reservations .
we &apos;re already up 50 % .
now do you see i &apos;m trustworthy again ?
blair , you and i both know
you &apos;ll never be completely trustworthy ...
and i admit , it &apos;s not my strong suit either ...
but it &apos;s part of what keeps things interesting between us .
and why we make a great team .
no , in order to be a team ,
we need to focus our duplicity on others .
but what if it &apos;s my way of showing you i love you ?
oh , i can think of better ways .
so i can handle being in
the &quot; she &apos;s dating him ? &quot; page of &quot; in touch &quot;
if you can handle not having a fake boyfriend .
mm . i couldn &apos;t be any happier with my real boyfriend .
actually , that &apos;s not true .
i @-@ i could be a little happier .
is vanessa still at her sister &apos;s gig in albany ?
yeah .
oh , well , i &apos;m feeling a little happier already .
uh , just ... just to confirm ,
that levitation thing was just a special effect , right ?
um , there &apos;s only one way to find out .
so i guess that means you heard about jonathan .
i guess it does .
i wanted to call it off ...
but as soon as those girls see me hesitate ,
i have a full @-@ blown rebellion on my hands .
you could have warned jonathan .
come on . everyone gets egged on halloween .
you didn &apos;t .
you know i have to act this way about school stuff .
but i &apos;m still your friend . i &apos;m still your sister .
we just can &apos;t let the worlds get confused .
i &apos;m not confused .
i want nothing to do with you in either world .
i &apos;m sorry about your purse getting locked in the club
and the police showing up
and dan and olivia kissing .
you did fine . you got my clients photographed
at the hottest party of the year .
patrick got more attention
than he &apos;s had since olivia dumped him .
as long as you get my purse back , your job is safe .
thank you .
and , serena , that job now includes
publicly dating patrick .
i don &apos;t know if i &apos;d call that work .
get back to me after date two .
it &apos;s a damn shame .
sometimes the best ones are just too hot not to burn out .
in this case , horace , this is just the first match .
a.b.c. won &apos;t let you get another license
for at least six months .
from what i recall , speakeasies were built
on finding ways around liquor regulation .
are you talking about
a secret password type of establishment ?
i &apos;m thinking keys .
keep the lock on the front door ,
come in through the back .
your father would be proud of you ...
in the best way .
hey , s .
i just came to find k.c. &apos; s purse .
hey . how would you like to be the publicist
of a members &apos; only club so exclusive
it makes the so.ho house look like one of those
dirty public schools with numbers for a name ?
come on . it &apos;ll be amazing
blair , i would never work for you .
but i &apos;m giving you a chance
to leave that lizzie grubman wannabe before you get run over .
you don &apos;t get it .
k.c. can be a bitch because she &apos;s my boss .
you &apos;re supposed to be my friend .
chuck might forgive you , but i don &apos;t .
like all good things ,
the witching hour must come to an end .
true natures are revealed .
tricks turn into treats .
and taking off costumes is
as much fun as putting them on .
everything returns to the way it was ,
except for little girls who forget
that halloween only lasts one night .
they wear their costumes for so long ,
pretty soon they can &apos;t even remember
who they were before they put them on .
