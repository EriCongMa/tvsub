gossip girl here .
you one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
hey ! it &apos;s the lovebirds .
hey , you two .
he told you
speaking for everyone else , i think it &apos;s great .
ever since i saw you
all i could think about was payback for last year .
did you put something in my drink ?
she &apos;s ready to party .
make sure you guys show her a good time .
jenny !
nate , thank you so much for tonight .
i &apos;m sorry , chuck . you need to leave .
what the hell is going on here ?
isn &apos;t it obvious ?
you &apos;ve been played , chuck ,
from the very beginning .
i didn &apos;t have the courage to tell you
that i signed the hotel over to jack .
and the hotel ?
oh , lost . i &apos;ve come this far without my mother .
i &apos;m not backing down now .
if it &apos;s a war jack wants , then it &apos;s a war he &apos;ll get .
every war has its weapons .
but on the upper east side ,
the rules of battle are simple--
there are no rules .
well , now i really , really hope
those are for my birthday .
uh , actually chuck and blair left them after one of their games .
happy birthday , though .
so when do i get to unwrap my present ?
what is that ?
it &apos;s , um , just a garter holster .
it &apos;s for my cell phone .
well , then i &apos;d better take you upstairs so i can inspect it .
oh , except i have to go shopping with blair
to pick out a dress for tonight .
you still haven &apos;t told me where you &apos;re taking me ,
but just so you know ,
you don &apos;t have to dress up
for a knicks game .
but you do for the frick benefit .
it &apos;s for asian horned toads . they &apos;re in danger .
that &apos;s your surprise-- a toad benefit ?
well , i know it &apos;s not what you would choose to do on your birthday ,
but chuck bought a table ,
and we can celebrate this weekend .
and you &apos;re going to lunch with your grandfather .
that &apos;s festive .
yeah , i &apos;m gonna hit the--hit the shower .
so you have fun shopping .
see you at 3 : 00 ?
yep .
hello , mr. nate .
i feel very bad not wishing him happy birthday
or bringing him polish breakfast sausage in bed .
oh , dorota ,
nate has to think everyone &apos;s blowing off his birthday
so he &apos;ll really be surprised tonight .
and he likes this game where you kill people ?
it &apos;s called &quot; assassin , &quot; and he loves it .
did you get his phone ?
in case anyone posts about the party ,
i don &apos;t want him checking &quot; gossip girl . &quot;
can you hide this ?
thank you , dorota .
you really have surrounded yourself with beautiful things ,
so easy to auction off . gotta love ebay .
as much as i hate to interrupt your fun ,
this has gone on long enough . i want my hotel back .
name your price .
i don &apos;t need your money , chuck .
then what is all this for--
just to hurt me ?
just to hurt you ? hurting you is a noble goal .
granted , you know , it wasn &apos;t all that difficult .
you &apos;re not the man you used to be .
if you &apos;re referring to the fact i &apos;m not in thailand
smoking hash with prostitutes ,
change is good .
young chuck in love .
beautiful ... and sad .
bart always said you were soft .
my father left me the company instead of you .
i get it .
i &apos;m more than happy letting lily guide my stock .
i know the empire is not your game
and if it &apos;s wounding me , you &apos;ve done it .
so why are you still here ?
it &apos;s an interesting feeling
holding another man &apos;s prized possession .
you wonder how far he &apos;ll go to get it back ,
if there &apos;s anything he wouldn &apos;t do .
i will do anything .
well , there is something that caught my eye .
i think i have to unfriend ryuichi .
i thought the boy you met in japan was named hideo .
i met them both . uh , hideo was--
more than a friend .
thank you . point is , hideo and his friends
have a fondness for bathhouses and group photos .
oh , my god . unfriend him immediately .
sayonara , ryuichi @-@ san .
yeah , i didn &apos;t need to see that .
today was supposed to be my rebound from jonathan .
now i need a rebound from hideo . it &apos;s a vicious cycle .
i &apos;m sure there are tons of boys who &apos;d love to go out with you .
rufus , jonathan and i are the only ones
at st. jude &apos;s who are even out . i should just bury myself
in work like jenny . hey , you know ,
i like working for eleanor .
i don &apos;t need a guy to make me feel fulfilled ...
especially when he &apos;s unavailable .
uh , poor nate .
what ? just reading the e @-@ mail from serena
reminding everyone to blow off his birthday .
that seems kind of mean .
it &apos;s an act .
she &apos;s planning this whole surprise thing at the waldorfs &apos; .
she &apos;s spending the whole afternoon getting it ready .
wait . i don &apos;t get it then .
what is nate supposed to do all day ,
just sit at home and think everyone forgot his birthdy ?
he spends five hours thinking serena is a terrible irlfriend .
he &apos;ll forgive her .
five hours .
i , uh ... have to go to te fabric store .
all right .
bye .
bye . oh , god .
denjuro , you are definitely not my friend .
hey . good morning .
huh ? oh , yeah . hey .
have you been up all night ?
&apos;cause it looks like you &apos;ve killed an entire forest ,
and your breath smells like something dead .
oh , thanks .
um , the application for the tisch writing program
is due in , uh , in-- in two days , so i just--
i need to bear down and finish my 1 @-@ act .
is this the same 1 @-@ act that you were 95 % done with last week ,
but didn &apos;t want to show me until it was 100 % done ?
uh , yeah , yeah ,
but you know , there &apos;s no point in showing it to you until
i &apos;ve taken it as far as i can myself .
this is why we used to show each other our work
as soon as possible , remember ?
uh , yeah , i do , but that was--
before we started sleeping together . yeah , i know .
but we said we &apos;d date and still be friends ,
and this is being friends . in fact ...
what &apos;s that ?
this is my script for my short film class
that i &apos;ve been nervous about showing you .
this is the one bsed on my short story .
now hand yours over .
uh ... okay .
all right . you gotta be completely honest here .
u , and i gotta ... you should ignore this first part .
in fact , why don &apos;t--why don &apos;t we just exchange tomorrow ?
you know , i gotta help serena out with nate &apos;s birthday party ,
and this it &apos;ll give me time to give yours proper consideration ,
maybe fine @-@ tune this one just a little bit more , which it needs .
nice try ,
but you can read mine on the subway after you shower .
have a good day .
jenny , hey .
hey . um , i tried texting you .
oh , yeah , i can &apos;t seem to find my cell phone .
oh . what are you doing here ?
it &apos;s your birthday . happy birthday .
all right , thank you .
here , i got you this .
you know , i &apos;d say , like , let me take you out to lunch or something .
but , um , i &apos;m sure you and serena already have plans .
no , actually . actually , we don &apos;t .
i was gonna--gonna go to lunch with my grandfather .
oh . all right , well , have fun .
nate
i really just wanted to say thank you again
for last week .
i don &apos;t know what would have happened .
you know what ? let me just call my grandfather and cancel .
i &apos;m sure he &apos;ll understand .
the look on his face was so sad .
i wanted to call him back and say ,
i didn &apos;t forget your birthday .
i &apos;ve got this whole party planned .
cruel to be kind , s. nate &apos;ll be fine .
no word from chuck ?
he was sitting down with satan this morning .
he &apos;s gonna lay everything out on the table ,
see if there &apos;s anything in the world he could offer jack
to give up the hotel .
he &apos;s come so far ,
become the person i always knew he could be .
but he could lose it all because he opened his heart
to that rven @-@ haired con artst .
everything will be fine , blair .
no matter what , chuck has you ,
and he loves you .
the empire is just a hotel .
you don &apos;t understand .
the hotel is proof that bart was wrong about chuck .
it &apos;s become who he is .
well , then you have to show him that he has so much more ,
starting with ...
buying this dress .
come on , b.
once chuck sees you in it , he &apos;ll realize
empire or no empire ,
blair waldorf loves him ,
and no one else can say that .
thanks , s.
i have to go get everything ready for nate &apos;s party .
are you gonna be okay ?
let me know if chuck calls you .
and buy that dress .
she &apos;s right . it is a remarkable dress ,
made only mre so by you in it .
what are you doing here , besides stalking me ?
please i was just window @-@ shopping
and saw something i liked .
you &apos;re supposed to be meeting with chuck .
oh , we met . ideas were discussed ,
voices raised , expletives used .
and how &apos;s your morning been , gorgeous ?
you think you &apos;ve won .
but chuck will find a way to get back what you stole .
there &apos;s always a way .
i told him how to get back his hotel .
and here &apos;s the kicker--
it wouldn &apos;t cost him a dime .
what are you talking about ?
i &apos;m saying chuck can have the empire ,
and all it would cost is you ...
spending the night with me .
how &apos;s that grab you ?
careful , b.
jack bass &apos; weapon of choice comes fully loaded ,
and if he hits his target ,
there &apos;ll be at least two victims .
i &apos;d rather spend the night with the marquis de sade
and yes , i know he &apos;s dead .
i &apos;m surprised this is your response--
knowing how attached chuck is to his hotel ,
what it means to him .
i thought you really cared for him .
excuse me , i thought you were just a disgusting pig .
but now i realize you &apos;re actually demented .
taking what belongs to chuck has become a real passion of mine ,
and i would find this particular conquest deeply satisfying .
while i &apos;m flattered , i assure you that chuck and i
will find another way .
chuck opened is heart to you ,
and now his future lies in your hands--
well , not your hands , exactly .
but you could fix this .
he would never have to know .
chuck will win , and i &apos;l be right by his side ,
as long as it takes for that to happen .
as long as you &apos;re at his side
and not mine ,
that will never happen .
you should at least try it on .
i was just about to call you .
you know that polaroid film i told you i had ?
i don &apos;t .
ohh . i promised serena that i would get it for nate &apos;s party .
we need it for the game of &quot; assassin . &quot; well ...
this is the one thing that she gave me to do .
if i mess it up , she will kill me
and not the fun game @-@ way .
done .
now what &apos;s wrong ?
is it bcause serena never threw you a surprise party ?
because you hate surprises .
no ,
no . uh , vanessa just-- she wrote this script .
she wants me to read it .
and ?
well , it &apos;s not great .
give her notes .
i thought that &apos;s what you guys always do with each other &apos;s work .
well , yeah , as friends .
i think in relationships ,
there &apos;s such a thing as too much honesty .
for instance , it would not have been a good idea for me
to tell serena how i felt aout every outfit she wore .
well , telling a woman you like her clothes is not lying .
it &apos;s self @-@ preservaton .
yeah ,
but the truth has shades of gray , right ?
i mean , there &apos;s such a thing as spin .
a half @-@ truth is a whole lie , son .
in my experience ,
it causes the same amount of problems down the line ,
especially with the ladies .
so serena must have something really great planned
for you guys tonight , right ?
yeah , some toad gala at the frick .
uh , that souns ...
boring ? yeah , i know .
i mean , it &apos;s not like i had some high expectations .
i just expected serena to be a little more ...
i mean , you know .
basically , this burger is definitely the best part of my day so far .
it &apos;s the best part of mine , too .
actually , you know , the best part of the week .
how are you ...
after that whole thing at eleanor &apos;s ?
you know you can always come to me , right ?
yeah , thanks .
but today is not about me .
did i mention that public embarrassment
is a part of the humphrey birthday tradition ?
okay , i &apos;m actually happy to be humiliated .
good . blow out your candle . make a wish .
yay !
okay , bye .
i brought my trench coat , camera .
prepare to be assassinated .
will do . thanks .
something wrong ?
oh , you read my script ...
and you didn &apos;t like it .
i can take it , i think .
um ... no , you &apos;re right .
i didn &apos;t , uh , i didn &apos;t like it .
i loved it .
really ? loved it ?
no notes ?
no . i mean , only note i &apos;ve got is i wish--
i wish there was more of it .
yeah , so what did you think of my play ?
oh , um , i didn &apos;t get a chance to read it yet .
oh , all right . no worries .
but i do have to get the application in day after tomorrow , so ...
okay .
oh , miss serena , i about to text .
dorota , what is going on ?
everything should be done by now .
everyone &apos;s gonna be here soon .
vans get mesed up . dead body cake go to wedding .
wedding cake come here . is very pretty ,
but pink not mr. nate &apos;s color .
oh , my god . we have to stall nate .
william has to keep him occupied .
no cookies like hearts !
find bullets and knives and little bombs that go boom !
mr. van der bilt , it &apos;s serena , but don &apos;t tell nate .
okay , um ...
y @-@ yeah , i &apos;ll let him know when i see him .
nate &apos;s not with him .
he said he called last @-@ minute and cancelled .
then where be he ?
let &apos;s find out .
well , listen , i gotta get going .
i told serena i &apos;d be there by 3 : 00
to get ready for the gala .
uh , white shirt , black tie .
i &apos;d think you &apos;d have it down by now .
have fun tonight .
yeah .
are you okay ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine .
i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s just whenever i &apos;m alone ,
i can &apos;t not think of the other night , you know ?
hey , i &apos;m sorry .
you shouldn &apos;t keep serena waiting .
it &apos;s just you &apos;re the only one
who gets what i &apos;m going through right now .
well , hey , i &apos;m sure serena won &apos;t mind
if i &apos;m a little bit late , right ?
like you said , white shirt , black tie .
how long can it take to get ready for a gala ?
&quot; attention , upper east siders . nate archibald is m.i.a.
&quot; send tips and pics a.s.a.p.
help serena find her man . &quot;
you know , i @-@ i kind of just want to disappear in the dark for a while .
do you want to go see a movie ?
i &apos;m in .
okay .
thank you , gregor .
chuck .
back from shopping and no packages ?
who are you , and what have you done with my girlfriend ?
nothing suited my sensibilities . how was your talk with jack ?
i was wrong to think i could negotiate with terrorists .
did he offer you anything ?
nothing i would ever consider .
maybe when he sees he can &apos;t get what he wants ,
he &apos;ll stop toying with you .
one can only hope .
hello ?
thank you .
you were right .
after i said no to jack &apos;s offer ,
he &apos;s called off the game play .
he &apos;s closing the hotel .
it &apos;s over .
miss blair , this package arrive for you .
there is card .
careful , b. don &apos;t forget your first rule of battle--
beware of bass &apos;s bearing gifts .
has nate showed up yet ?
he &apos;ll be here soon .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m really sorry . i &apos;m sure he &apos;ll be here any minute .
hey , um , any word on nate from vanya &apos;s doorman contacts ?
dorota has pretty much the entire eastern block on lookout .
anything on &quot; gossip girl &quot; ?
uh , i &apos;m gonna keep looking .
serena , come here .
you &apos;ve done some unforgivable things like having sex with nate
when we were saving ourselves for each other
or killing pete fairman--
what ?
how far is too far ?
where is that place you can &apos;t come back anymore ?
blair , what are you talking about ?
is chuck gonna do something to jack ?
what ?
i mean ... yes . there is somthing someone could do
to get back the empire , and yes , it is terrible ,
but they &apos;d be doing it out of love .
love of whom ?
just love . the point is ,
if someone does something awful ,
but it &apos;s for love , is it okay ?
if you are crossing some moral line
to best jack bass , then probably not .
what are you not telling me ?
nothing . you &apos;re right .
thank you .
i should go get dressed .
oh , and i invited my minions .
it &apos;ll be like shooting fish in a barrel .
hey , jenny . it &apos;s me .
uh , i just wanted to remind you that nate needed to be here
no later than an hour ago . bring him to the party right now .
hey , where &apos;s nate ?
i &apos;m determined to believe he &apos;ll arrive momentarily .
he better , with all of his columbia friends here .
do you want me to start taking pictures of people ?
yes , please .
i &apos;ll grab vanessa &apos;s camera .
hey . do you need something ?
camera . here .
smile like the killer you are .
chuck ?
are you gonna come down and join the party ?
i just heard from my lawyers .
i was waiting to see if there was any chance
of keeping the empire doors open .
and ?
there &apos;s not . jack &apos;s within his rights to shutter the place .
i just have to watch it die , a slow , painful death .
when you bought the empire ,
you told me you knew you could do it because i believe in you .
that hasn &apos;t changed . you &apos;ll find a way .
when are you going to get it ? there is no way !
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m not mad at you . it &apos;s my own fault .
i am everything my father said i was .
oh . even without the guest of honor , it &apos;s still a great party .
i can &apos;t believe he didn &apos;t even call .
well , you did steal his phone .
you have a point , but we did have plans ,
even if it was a made @-@ up ball for a non @-@ endangered reptile .
okay , you &apos;re freaking me out with the nunchakus .
he probably thinks that i didn &apos;t care about his birthday .
surprise !
surprise !
sorry we &apos;re late , everyone !
crazy , you .
uh @-@ oh , s.
looks like little j. &apos; s knives are sharpened ,
and she &apos;s ready to use them in the battle
for nate archibald .
the game of &quot; assassin &quot; is simple--kill or be killed .
your photo is your life . you wear it aroun your neck .
if someone grabs your picture before you grab theirs ,
then you &apos;re dead , and you have to give them all the pictures
of everyone else you &apos;ve killed . once you &apos;re a ghost ,
you come back here to the safe zone for the party .
you can &apos;t go beyond this block , but restaurants , buildings ,
shops-- all fair game .
the winner is the last assassin on the street ,
and they have all the other photos .
so you have five safe minutes to leave the builing .
starting now .
i can &apos;t believe you were in on this .
nicely played .
thank you .
i figured someone had to keep him distracted .
i gotta go before i end up dead .
i can &apos;t believe you did this . it &apos;s awesome .
i mean , you totally had me going .
apparently . what , were you just not gonna show up to the gala ?
what ? no . something with jenny just came up .
yeah , i got that .
okay , we have exactly four minutes left to live .
do you really want to spend it talking like this ?
hey , come on . game &apos;s starting .
let &apos;s go .
i &apos;m already dead .
you still have your photo .
formality .
although you &apos;re welcome to kill me again if you like .
hello , dorota .
what are you doing here ? i will be killed if someone find me .
why would somebody kill you ? anti @-@ royalists from russia ?
no . in game .
then i must do something before you die .
dorota ..
from the first moment i saw you ,
i knew you were princess .
and every day you make me feel like king .
will you--
yes , yes ! yes , of course i will marry you !
at lest now i die with happiness .
oh ! oh , vanya , i &apos;m so sorry .
hey . you okay ?
uh , yeah , i am . are you ... okay ?
i am engaged .
congratulations , both of you .
uh , sorry . a friend &apos;s housekeeper
and our doorman just got engaged .
but you obviously got that , the--the engagement .
yeah , that &apos;s pretty self @-@ explanatory .
it &apos;s the all @-@ black outfit that &apos;s throwing me .
i &apos;m in the middle of a game of assassin .
oh . well , okay , please continue on your way .
i hate to contribute to your untimely death .
it looks like i &apos;m safe for a moment .
do you live in the building ?
no . i just like hanging out in random lobbies ,
overhearing marriage proposals
and looking for pickup games of assassin .
then this is definitely your lucky day .
indeed .
there is actually someting that i have to take care of
for a minute , but dead or alive , i will be right back .
yeah , thanks .
thank you
hey , get out of my truck !
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
i have more important prey to hunt .
you might want to call rufus and say your good @-@ bye .
okay . i &apos;m kind of into this killer side of you .
well , i &apos;d hate for you to die
witout getting a chance to read my script .
i promise i will . i know you have a deadline .
you know , i &apos;ll give you another copy
cause the one in your bag is pretty marked up .
i &apos;m sorry , dan . i didn &apos;t know what to do .
and i was gonna tell you , but then you liked mine so much ,
that i din &apos;t know what to say .
are you saying you felt sorry for me ?
that &apos;s not what i meant .
well , good . as long as we &apos;re being honest ,
your script was not an &quot; a &quot; -plus .
it was a &quot; d. &quot;
at least you &apos;ll be together on the other side .
hey , whoa , whoa , whoa . i don &apos;t care about the game .
we need to talk .
okay . about what ?
what were you doing with nate today ?
keeping him busy .
we both know that wasn &apos;t the plan .
nate and i are just friens .
friends don &apos;t kiss friends at their fashion shows .
you have history with him .
yes , ancient .
i promise i &apos;m not gonna do anything
to give nate the wrong impression .
now is that all ?
no .
you can &apos;t kill me . you &apos;re already dead .
no , i &apos;m not .
yes , you are .
any last words before i open this door and murder you ?
look , i know you thought that i blew off your birthday ,
but you did ditch me .
serna , it wasn &apos;t like that .
nate ...
i need to know why you ignored our plans
to spend the day with jenny .
well , i promised her i wouldn &apos;t say anything .
okay , last week something really messed up happened to her .
and she came to you about it ?
only because i was involved .
well , that &apos;s not making me feel any better .
okay , some girls from eleanor &apos;s fashion show--
they roofie &apos;d her , and then they dumped her off at some bar
with all these guys .
oh , my god . i @-@ is she okay ?
yeah . i mean , i got there before anything actually happened ,
but , you know , she &apos;s-- she &apos;s having a tough time .
so ...
i &apos;m sorry .
you &apos;re such a good guy , nate archibald .
can i kiss you before i kill you ?
gotcha . watch your back .
well , looks like it &apos;s just you and nate left .
i &apos;m on it .
hey , chuck , have you seen blair ?
i assume she &apos;s still slaying .
she can &apos;t be . her polaroid &apos;s right here .
you know blair . she &apos;s probably cheating .
if you &apos;ll excuse me a moment ...
blair ?
when all other weapons fail ,
there &apos;s always human sacrifice .
i ... knew the memory of our new year &apos;s together
would bring you back .
i &apos;m not here for you .
i here to get chuck &apos;s hotel
eh , semantics , really .
i &apos;ve had a contract drawn up .
now suddenly you don &apos;t trust me ?
what are your demands ?
&quot; no kissing &quot; seems to be ,
you know , some working girls &apos; rule of thumb .
you &apos;ll tell chuck that you realized
he isn &apos;t worth losing bass australia over .
now that you &apos;ve devalued the empire ,
you &apos;re wiling to sell it back ,
at a profit , of course ,
so he doesn &apos;t suspect anything .
you know i love a win @-@ win proposition .
and chuck can never know .
uh , i think i &apos;ve already proven i &apos;m not one to kiss and tell .
fine .
i &apos;ve ... i &apos;ve already had his hotel .
now i &apos;ll leave
knowing i &apos;ve had the thing he holds even dearer .
everything that was his is mine .
that dress looks almost as beautiful on
as i &apos;m sure it will off .
but first , a drink .
oh , i &apos;m sorry . she &apos;s trying to kill me .
yeah , only ... because he &apos;s trying to kill me .
the grilled cheese with truffles is really good , by the way .
looks like it &apos;s &quot; till death do us part . &quot;
someday maybe you girls find true love , too ...
and your children not grow up to be bastards .
congratulations , dorota , vanya .
hey , uh , dorota ,
do you remember the guy that i was talking to in the lobby ?
i don &apos;t even remember own name .
all a blur of sparkly ...
so , uh , it ... iit wasn &apos;t a &quot; d. &quot; it wasn &apos;t .
but it wasn &apos;t an &quot; a &quot; -plus , either .
i did think the male character &apos;s dialogue
sounded a little bit like a girl , you know , so ...
i can see that . thanks for being honest .
that &apos;s actually a really helpful note .
uh , all right . well , you gotta do me now .
tear me to pieces . be brutal .
you know i think you &apos;re aazing writer .
really ? that brutal ?
it &apos;s just ...
a play about a homeless man winning the lottery ?
it seems a little out of your wheelhouse .
well , i was ... you know , i was trying to show some range .
i know . but when you write about what you know ,
you &apos;re amazing .
like that story about graduating from st.jude &apos;s
having never fit in ... that was really beautiful .
see , what would have happened if you didn &apos;t tell me this ,
and i sent the wrong one with my tisch application ?
they would &apos;ve loved you anyway .
sure you &apos;re not lying again ?
never .
is it wrong that trying to kill you
is the best time i &apos;ve had in months ?
actually , that &apos;s a great reason to let me live .
you are the birthday boy .
i should let you kill me .
you &apos;re dead .
champagne okay ?
i prefer something stronger to kill the germs .
it must be lonely for you
with chuck under all this pressure .
has the stress compromised his ability to perform romantically ?
i &apos;m here because i love chuck .
don &apos;t flatter yourself
into thinking i &apos;m going to enjoy this .
whatever you need to tell yourself .
i think we &apos;ve had enough foreplay .
thank you .
what ?
that &apos;s it ? you already signed the contract .
you can &apos;t go back now .
don &apos;t worry . chuck will get his hotel .
but contrary to what you may believe ,
i prefer the woman who want to have sex with me .
i don &apos;t understand .
if you don &apos;t want me , then why did you set this up ?
i told chuck i &apos;d take either you or the hotel .
he chose to give me you .
no . what are you talking about ?
chuck doesn &apos;t know anything about this .
really ?
because it seems to me
he knew exactly which buttons to have me push .
said you wouldn &apos;t be able to resist stepping in
to save him behind his back .
you were there while i was shopping .
you were the only one who saw this dress .
and who do you think sent me to that store ?
i &apos;d never drop that kind of money on a dress .
my goal was to destroy chuck .
but that he has you , i had to break that bond .
chuck would never do this to me .
if you don &apos;t believe me ,
check his credit card receipts .
i &apos;m sorry , blair .
just be grateful one of the bass men has some moral integrity .
although , if you &apos;re interested in some revenge sex ...
i &apos;d be more than happy to oblige .
arms are laid down ,
only to realize you &apos;ve been hit by friendly fire .
okay , so what the hell was that ?
what do you mean ? we were playing , and i killed you .
jenny , us hanging out was ... just as friends .
yeah , i know . nate ,
seriously , i thought that you &apos;d be happy
i was finally having fun again .
guys , i won .
congratulations .
thank you .
hey , i &apos;m so glad it &apos;s over .
hi . how could you lose ?
oh , stop it .
cds .
home so soon ?
please tell me jack was lying ,
that you wouldn &apos;t betray me like that .
me , betray you ?
you &apos;re the one who just came from seeing my uncle .
i went there for you because i thought
it was the only way that would save your hotel .
i would &apos;ve done anything to help you .
all you had to do was ask .
if i asked , it wouldn &apos;t have worked .
you would have been too willing .
when jack came to you ,
he would &apos;ve known we were working together .
i did what i had to , to win .
no .
i can &apos;t lt my feelings cost me all that i &apos;ve built .
even if it means losing me instead ?
all i ever did was love you .
&quot; the worst thing i ever did ,
the darkest thought i ever had . &quot;
you said you would stand by me through anything .
this , blair , is &quot; anything . &quot;
i never thought that the worst thing you would ever do would be to me .
you went up there on your own .
good @-@ bye , chuck .
hey . i &apos;m sorry for tricking you .
oh , it was worth it .
seriously ? best birthday ever .
well , it &apos;s not over yet .
i still have to give you your present .
hey , jenny , you ready ? i &apos;m gonna grab our coats .
yeah , i &apos;m done .
i mean , yeah , i &apos;m ready to go .
i thought you didn &apos;t grab any .
when the battle ends and weapons are put away ,
new strategies take shape .
hey , vanessa .
professor romano sent this over earlier .
you weren &apos;t here ,
so the messenger left it with me .
i didn &apos;t know you were applying to the tisch writing program .
i &apos;m ... kind of not telling anyone .
it &apos;s really competitive .
i mean , there are only a few spots for n.y.u. transfers .
i hope you get in .
thanks .
soldiers decide to fend for themselves .
hey , there you are .
i think you lost this .
thanks .
how &apos;d you know what apartment i was in ?
well , i , uh ... i started on the first floor and worked my way up .
you do realize that this is the penthouse , right ?
i &apos;m eric .
i &apos;m elliot .
new alliances are made ...
but there are casualties .
welcome home , chuck .
you &apos;re not mad at me , are you ?
i mean , you didn &apos;t actually believe
blair could sleep with me and you two would be okay ?
or are you mad because i told her ?
security ,
i need jack bass escorted from my penthouse immediately .
you may have told her ...
but blair and i will get past this .
is that what you think ?
don &apos;t you get it , chuck ?
blair &apos;s seen the real you now .
it &apos;s over .
she could never love that .
no one could .
hope the empire &apos;s everything you wanted ,
&apos;cause now that &apos;s all you got .
in matters of love and war ,
all weapons cause injury .
the question is ,
who will live to fight another day ?
