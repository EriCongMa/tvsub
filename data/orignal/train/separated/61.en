This is about a plane crash.
A Hammett GR-6 carrying
35 passengers and five crew.
All 40 dead.
Many of their widows and widowers are here today.
And all want to know one thing.
Why did this plane just drop from the sky?
Like Kyle Lidtke.
He lost his wife and two daughters in this crash.
Now, the CEO of Hammett Aerospace
would have him believe it's the pilot's fault,
and not their plane.
But we ask you to reject
this cynical, blame-the-victim defense,
because this is a very simple case of...
...A flawed airplane design.
My co-counsel, Ms. Lockhart,
represents the families of the passengers.
I represent the families of the crew.
But we decided to combine our lawsuits
because we agree on one thing.
Hammett Aerospace put a jet into service
that they knew was defective.
How do we know this?
How do we know that they knew their jet was defective?
Because there is a very brave whistleblower
from within Hammett who's agreed to testify for us.
Damn.
Not to sound too cynical, but this could be a good thing.
Guilt-ridden whistle-blower
testifying from beyond the grave?
They didn't do a great job cross-examining in the depo.
And it's hard to cross-examine a corpse.
The problem was in the wings.
The de-icing in the wings?
Yes.
It was a system of tubes that distributed fluid
to de-ice the wings during flight.
Not bad.
We admit this into evidence.
And avoid further cross-examination.
Yup.
Falling forward.
Well, that's the problem.
She's a great tutor.
Grace's physics grades are the best of this year.
And where did you find her?
The tutor Eli suggested her.
And Grace is friends with her now?
Yes. I'll talk to her.
Who, Grace or the tutor?
The tutor.
Well, I can find some tutor referrals around here.
No, that's okay.
Let me handle it with a flyswatter, not a bazooka.
I didn't think I was handling it with a bazooka.
Uh, okay, we'll talk.
I got to go.
Yes, sir.
David Lee's here.
We need more conference room space.
I'm like an itinerant farmer out here.
So, Alicia,
David and I head up the hiring committee,
and we've decided the firm needs a new first-year associate.
So we want you to interview and hire someone.
Really?
These are the new graduates
from U of C. See who you like.
You want me to do the actual hiring?
In consultation with the committee.
And you'll be mentoring him, too, so choose well.
Or her.
Oh, Alicia, uh, I need
to talk to you a minute about the Cole divorce, hmm?
Thank you for this.
No, not me. David.
I'm still supposed to be tense with you, remember?
And by the way, I know how Celeste works.
Don't worry about it.
No, she thrives on chaos.
She'll say a lot of things about me just to see how you react.
Then I won't react.
So, we can't use "Cole divorce" as our cover word anymore
because I actually have a Cole divorce.
Oh. Well, we don't need a cover word.
I'm still undecided about it.
Ah, yes, the fiction of separation.
You're putting your kids in private school?
New item in your financial journal.
I'm thinking of it, yes.
That's $35,000 to 50 a year.
I know.
My advice is, you don't.
Thank you, but I'm fine.
No, you don't understand. I'm not your accountant.
You can overspend on anything you like, but
you need to get your husband to pay half.
I... Why?
To preserve your dependency.
You pay that amount on your own,
you lose your best argument against spousal maintenance.
Well, I'm not asking Peter for spousal maintenance.
No, not you. Him.
Hey, don't blame me. You guys wanted equal treatment.
Thank Gloria Steinem.
Peter makes less in the State's Attorney office than you.
He could come after you for support.
Peter's not coming after me for support.
Alicia, he'll come after you for everything.
No, he wants the governorship.
That's what Eli's plotting over there right now.
欧巴马总统曾在04年民主党全国大会上作主旨发言
Give him the keynote.
Are you kidding?
At the Democratic Convention?
Peter has the best story.
He went to prison on a trumped-up charge,
fought it, and made it back into office.
It's a story of rebirth.
Eli, he's a state's attorney.
And Obama was a state senator when he got the keynote.
And a black man.
Who is it?
Who's what?
Who are you championing?
You must have somebody already.
Adam Spellman.
Oh, come on!
No to the State's Attorney, but yes to a dogcatcher?
He's not a dogcatcher.
He's a strong businessman with...
You think that's what America wants to see up on that dais?
Eli, it's already in the works. We're pushing Spellman.
Don't worry about it.
Peter Florrick's marriage is his secret weapon,
not some keynote address.
So, how is she doing?
They knew the de-icing fluid tended to freeze
in the wing lines,
but they decided to save money
and do nothing about it.
We move to introduce this deposition into evidence, Your Honor.
And we object, Your Honor. It's hearsay.
We can't cross-examine a corpse.
Really, Mr. Roda?
I'm sorry, Your Honor. Inelegantly put.
But I can't cross-examine the deceased.
Your Honor, Rule 212 expressly permits the use
of a recorded deposition when a witness dies.
But only if the court, in its discretion, determines
it won't do a substantial injustice,
such as in the case of perjury.
Which is why, in the current matter, I would direct
the court's attention to Mr. Ritter's suicide note.
It consists of two lines.
"It's a lie. I'm sorry."
Your Honor, Mr. Ritter's wife was claiming
he slept with their 16-year-old baby-sitter.
The note refers to that.
We don't know that.
He could be referring to his testimony in this trial.
At the very least, the meaning is unclear.
Unclear? Oh, really? Are you serious?
I'm not prepared to interpret the law...
You can all wear yourselves down.
Tell me when you're ready.
What do we do now?
We have other options.
Like what?
We'll ask for a continuance.
We still have our expert witnesses.
You thought they weren't enough.
Hold them accountable,
please... for my wife and daughters.
Kalinda, what are you doing?
Um, Eli business. What do you need?
Yeah, I'm already on it.
Yeah?
Adam Spellman-- do you know who that is?
Adam Spellman. A businessman.
Head of the Chicago Black Leadership Council.
Yeah, I need you to look into him.
Look?
As in, find dirt.
Why?
He's the likely keynote speaker at the next Democratic Convention,
and if he has a skeleton in his closet,
I do not want him blowing up in the face of the Democratic Committee.
Really? How selfless of you.
Yeah, well, I'm a caring individual.
I need it quick.
Yeah. Everybody needs it quick.
Ah.
That was quick.
It was a blind CC.
Ritter e-mailed the CEO about the de-icing problems,
and on Ritter's copy,
there were only two e-mail addresses included in the CC.
But on the CEO's copy, he BCC'd someone else.
CS at Herald Equity Group? Who's that?
Oh, no.
What?
He's a client of ours from two years ago.
He was the venture capitalist on their IPO.
CEO kept him in the loop.
Great.
What?
Well, he's not the most dependable of witnesses.
He might not even talk to us.
He won't.
Call Alicia.
Why?
He'll talk to her.
Here I didn't think we'd get a chance to work together.
See? Isn't this fun?
So, you and I should get some drinks,
trade whore stories.
Horror?
Yeah. What did I say?
He's not allowed to touch you, or hand you anything.
There's a panic button at the table if there's any problems.
That's not his style. How much does he know?
Nothing. I thought I'd let you broach it.
Just like Clarice Starling, huh?
Mrs. Florrick, what a pleasure.
You seem well.
Oh, under the circumstances,
I, uh, do the best I can.
You have a tattoo, I see.
What?
Oh. Oh, yeah.
Oh, this... oh, this old thing?
I wanted William Blake's the Ancient of Days,
but beggars really can't be choosers here.
And you, Mrs. Florrick-- I imagine you're well?
Your husband's back in office,
you're thriving in your profession.
The world must be your oyster.
I would say the grass is always greener, but...
Yes.
Although, there's a refreshing honesty to prison.
People don't dissemble here, they just take.
My firm needs your help, Mr. Sweeney.
So, that's it for small talk?
We're suing a company-- Hammett Aerospace.
There was a plane crash.
The Dorset crash, yes, I know.
You were the financier on their IPO.
We had a witness who knew there was a problem
with the de-icing system on the plane
but he committed suicide.
Oh, dear.
Yes.
Anyway, he was testifying to a meeting you attended.
And you were wondering if I might testify in his stead?
Yes.
Why me?
Why not O.J.?
比眼前这位幸运多了
Won't the jury be likely to mistrust
the word of a renowned wife-killer?
You were never convicted.
Oh, yes.
One of those fine distinctions in the law.
Imprisoned on something I didn't even do.
I hate irony.
I heard America's irony-free these days.
Yes, it's been outlawed.
I like you, Alicia.
Why don't you like me?
You killed your wife.
And there's nothing I can do about that?
Testify.
Would that help you?
It would help 40 families suing Hammett Aerospace.
Yes, and I'm sure they're all adorable, but...
will it help you?
Yes.
Then, of course, I'll help.
Oh, thank you for waiting.
Work.
Um... I think you're doing a great job as a tutor.
I just...
Do you, um, want something? You want a latte or...
Oh, no.
So, these... videos,
um, that you make, these dance videos, um,
they're just...
How old are you, Jennifer?
I'm 22.
And you and Grace have become friends?
Yes.
And these, um,
dance... videos, uh,
are f...
um, what are they for?
The Internet.
You make money off of them?
No.
You just do them?
Yes.
I don't understand.
I like doing them.
Okay. Um, Jennifer, I...
I just want you to be a tutor.
Okay? I-I want you to work with Grace on her homework.
I don't want Grace making these videos with you anymore.
Okay.
Is that it?
Yes.
Oh, my God, you're good!
Thanks.
So, Adam Spellman,
a Democrat, really gave money
而民主党一向支持同性婚姻
to support the Defense of Marriage Act?
His wife did-- she's a devout Baptist,
and knew it would be a problem.
That's why the money came through her company.
And then they tried to hide it.
I mean, I think this is good that the DNC
knows this now, long before the convention.
Yeah. That's very selfless of you.
Okay, I need you to look into these other names
they're considering for keynote.
They may get in the way. In the way of what?
Peter Florrick.
I didn't know this was for Peter Florrick.
Oh, don't worry, I'll pay out of my own pocket.
The list.
No. But thanks, though.
What's wrong?
Nothing. I have other work.
Thank you for coming in, Caitlin.
No, thank you-- this is so cool.
Um, a very impressive resume.
You did a summer at Wyler & Wolf in New York.
So why us?
Well, in a word, litigation. Transactional's fine,
but litigation is what really turns me on.
And the University of Chicago.
What turned you on there?
Moot court.
It was an opportunity to dig deep into an area of law
but still keep my feet grounded in something real.
And did you win?
Well, my partner and I did.
It was a team effort.
I can work on my own, but I love being part of a team.
So, after your summer at Wyler, did you get a job offer, or...?
No. They had a hiring freeze. The economy.
But I would rather be here, anyway.
Just an odd question,
it's a question they asked me when I first interviewed here.
What's your favorite hobby?
Well, I'm embarrassed to say it.
Oh, come on, Martha, let's hear it.
What was your hobby?
No, no, no, no--
I'm the one asking the questions here.
Okay. I like foreign movies, old movies,
like Truffaut and Godard.
Tramp-boarding.
Um...
wh-what's that?
Skateboarding on a trampoline,
without wheels.
I know.
But I can do a double somersault from a full-blown ollie.
To be honest,
I've had an offer from Canning & Meyers.
But I really do want to work here.
I like the family spirit.
Well, if you could hold off Canning & Meyers,
we can get back to you in a few days.
That's great. Thank you, Alicia.
Ladies and gentlemen,
You are hearing our testimony from a convict
housed at the Pine Creek Penitentiary.
Under agreement between the attorneys,
the questioning will be conducted via closed-circuit video.
How's my hair?
It's fine.
Y-You might want to cover...
Mm...
So are we clear on what you say?
I am to answer honestly and completely.
Yes, but not too completely.
Just keep your answers short and on point.
How long?
About five minutes.
Something...
about you two.
Some kind of tension there.
What is it?
Are you gonna tell him?
I would like to just concentrate on his testimony.
Oh, come on, you can't leave it like that.
There won't be any testimony unless you tell me what it is.
We're lovers.
We've been keeping it secret for months. Alicia?
I really don't want to talk about it right now.
She's breaking up with me for a man who is not worthy of her.
If only it were true.
Ready to go.
Three, two, go.
Short and to the point.
Hello, Mr. Sweeney. Can you hear me?
Yes, ma'am. Good morning.
Good morning to you. I understand you've been sworn in.
May I ask you a few questions?
Yes. I've been wonderfully prepped here
by two of your beautiful attorneys.
Mr. Sweeney, can you tell us
how you became acquainted with Hammett Aerospace?
Yes. I...
uh, rather, my company--
my company--
was, uh... retained to provide financing
for their initial public stock offering.
How's that?
And in that capacity,
did you attend a meeting at which Hammett executives
discussed potential problems with the GR-6?
Uh, yes, um, I-I believe I did.
And at this meeting, can you tell us
what was discussed regarding the de-icing system on the airplane?
The... I'm sorry, I-I...
Uh, could you repeat the...
At this meeting...
We need to cut him off; he's gonna hurt us.
...the de-icing system on the airplane?
Mr. Sweeney, do you need a moment?
I don't... I don't know.
Your Honor, I have to ask for a brief continuance.
Uh, clearly, my witness is having health issues.
Your witness is having second thoughts.
Mr. Sweeney, what are you doing?
What am I doing?
I'm undercutting your case.
Why?
Because I want something.
What?
Freedom.
He'll testify if we free him?
With good behavior, he's got two years left on his sentence.
He says that he has something to offer the State's Attorney.
Evidence on drugs in prison.
I think I can find a way to get around
the private school money situation.
Hold on, Margie. Hold on.
Well, thank you.
No problem.
So, uh, how are the interviews going?
Great. I reinterviewed my top two choices,
and I think I've made a decision.
Great. Isn't Caitlin fantastic?
Caitlin?
Yes. Did she tell you how much
she loves competition?
She did. Do you know her?
Yes. She's my niece.
I told her not to mention it because I didn't
want her to win out based on nepotism.
I'm glad you liked her.
Well, I did, um, but I...
What?!
No! Oh, come on!
Next time I'll get some long benches in here.
Colin Sweeney wants to make a deal.
Yes. I read your e-mail.
Oh, yes. Imani. Hello.
Come on in, come on in.
This is Imani Stonehouse-- she's an AUSA
assigned to our office to review racial bias in sentencing,
and she keeps me honest with all my plea bargains.
Okay. So...
our good friends from Lockhart/Gardner...
And Monty & Columbech.
Yes.
They have an offer to make us in trade
for releasing the wife-killer, Colin Sweeney.
The defensive killer of his stalker, Colin Sweeney.
And I'm sure Imani'll have something to say about that.
Cary, you've seen an increase in heroin distribution
at the Cook County prison complex.
Mr. Sweeney can tell you who
and how, including guards.
In trade for his freedom.
Yes.
I don't think that's going to fly, but thank you.
Why don't you check with your boss.
Peter Florrick promised to fight corruption in the prison system.
This could go a long way towards that.
Okay.
I'll be right back.
So where did you go to school?
Brown. You?
Harvard. Siblings?
Three brothers.
Lawyers?
No, the family was happy to have just one lawyer.
One's a painter, one's a writer,
one teaches at the Sorbonne.
Really?
That's in France, isn't it?
Hmm.
Okay, I talked to Peter, and he has a counteroffer.
Okay. What counteroffer?
Donny Pike.
Senior acting member of the Aryan Warlords.
He's finishing up a five year stretch at Pine Creek Penitentiary.
Oh, come on.
The most dangerous man in the Illinois system?
Yes, he is.
And a confidante of Colin Sweeney.
Mr. Sweeney gives him stock tips and Pike gives him protection.
You want Sweeney to testify against him?
Yes. If he wants a reduction in his sentence.
The last witness you tried to turn against him was murdered.
Yes. Well, we've learned from our mistakes.
Here, you can keep this.
I was the ASA who won that plea bargain
and you're really considering reversing it?
Not reversing it. He's served two years.
For killing a woman.
No, involuntary manslaughter, with good behavior.
This is Colin Sweeney we're talking about.
The public knows his name.
If we release him, we'll be crucified.
Not if we're using him to stop
a neo-Nazi from committing more murders from prison.
What do you think, Imani?
I think it's worth it
if we can stop this white supremacist.
Yeah. If you stop him.
But if Colin Sweeney takes the stand,
I don't know a jury in the world who would trust him.
Okay, we're going to make the deal.
Peter, this is a mistake.
You'll be the man who released O.J.
Would you make the deal if it was just anybody?
But it's not just anybody.
I know, but if it were...
would you make the deal?
Two years left on an involuntary manslaughter?
There's your answer.
But Geneva makes a good point about the testimony.
We're going to make the deal,
but he's got to give us more.
What more?
A wire.
Eli.
What have you got?
Keynote address at the Democratic Convention.
They were going with Spellman,
but he has an issue opposing gay marriage,
so I got you the hearing with Donna Brazile.
I'm stunned.
That's why you hired me, Peter.
To stun you.
Look, you don't have to decide about running for governor.
Just take the meeting, sweep her off her feet,
keep hitting the prison thing.
That's your selling point.
What?
I may be in the news this week.
Okay.
A plea bargain that could gain a lot of attention.
Can you delay it?
I could.
But I won't.
So this ethical thing is for real, right?
I would love to give that keynote speech.
Then don't get in the news.
And what does Kalinda Sharma have against you?
The investigator at Lockhart/ Gardner,
she won't do any work for you.
What's that about?
I don't know.
Really? I didn't know that. Is she good?
Caitlin?
Yes. It's just...
she's David Lee's niece, and I'm feeling a little pressure.
Who's the better lawyer?
Well, they're both good.
It's just...
I don't know, there's something about Martha.
I like her.
And Caitlin is a classic "C" Student.
Well, you know what they say:
"A" Students make great professors,
"B" Students make great judges,
and "C" Students make partner.
Mom!
Okay, I got to go. Thanks, Will.
Did you tell Jennifer not to be friends with me?
Did I...?
Did you tell her not to be my friend?
No, I told her that I wanted her
to concentrate more on your studies.
Why? What did she say?
Nothing.
She left after we studied.
Why would you tell her that?
Because, Grace...
she's 22, and you're 14.
So?
So...
Why isn't she with friends her own age?
Because she's my friend.
No, she's you're tutor.
I'm paying her.
Why can't she be both?
Because it's unprofessional.
It's...
I don't have friends, Mom.
Don't you know that?
She's my only real friend.
She's my friend.
And with you at work all the time...
No, no, no, no, no, no.
You do not get to play that card.
Look, maybe I overreacted.
I just don't want you doing these videos.
I just think it's dangerous to do them in the street.
It's not.
Grace, would you please
just let me be the parent for a minute here.
If you want to take dance...
I don't want to take dance.
I just want to do this.
Why?
Because it's cool.
Because nobody else is doing it.
Okay, let me think on it.
Alicia Florrick.
Ah, my goodness.
The quality of convicts has really gone downhill.
We have a deal for you, Mr. Sweeney.
That's why we're meeting you here.
They will give you your freedom
in exchange for evidence against Donny Pike.
Donald?
Yes,
he's ordered the deaths of four witnesses from prison.
You want me to testify against him?
No. The deal's not for what you know.
It's for what you'll find out.
We don't think you're the most trustworthy witness.
That's why we'll need you to wear a wire.
That wasn't the deal.
Well, that's the new deal.
We're arranging to have Pike transferred to another prison,
they'll route him through County.
Mr. Sweeney and Pike will have three hours together in the yard.
Get him to admit to his newest murder, and you're free.
No. It's too dangerous.
Is it, Mr. Sweeney?
Is it too dangerous?
You don't want to do this.
Alicia, it's his decision.
You're gonna have to supervise the wire.
He thinks you care about him.
What's even weirder-- you do care about him.
No. I don't want him getting killed.
That's a pretty low bar for caring.
It's a pretty high bar for a wife-killer.
You're very interesting, Alicia.
How did you end up with Will?
What makes you think we ended up together?
Will's attitude.
He's smitten.
Really? Smitten.
Feels like the right word.
It's sweet and high school, and very vanilla.
That's no slam on you.
No, of course not.
But what about you?
You broke up with Will nine years ago.
And yet, here you are, trying to hurt him.
Talk about high school.
What do you think you're doing?!
David.
She's my niece. I told you she's my niece.
Oh, wait a minute. You-You told me to hire who I wanted.
Yes, and I told you she was my niece.
What else do you need to know?
Look, David, Caitlin's good.
She's very good, and she'll find another job.
This isn't about another.
Don't you dare cross me again.
You said you didn't want nepotism.
No, I said there was no nepotism.
You are a third-year associate.
You were given this task because you are unimportant,
and you can take a hint.
So take the hint,
or we'll take it out of your hands.
Let's get a drink.
You know the best revenge?
Hide his Bluetooth.
No. Hire his niece, and then make her life hell.
Oh, my God, you are so right.
You'll never do it.
No, I will do it.
I'm not a good person.
Yes, you are. Shut up.
I just don't like women.
I find them uninteresting.
Excuse me?
I don't like women.
They're all competing with me.
Don't men compete with you?
No, they don't.
You have female friends?
No,
but I don't have any male friends, either.
That's so sad.
I'd be your friend, but I can't.
Why not?
Because. Will.
Ah, that's right.
Yeah.
I don't like you being with him.
I'm gonna break you two up.
Okay. How?
How will I do it?
I will... tell you about him.
Well, go ahead.
Give me your worst.
No. I like you.
See, that's your problem.
You built it up too much,
so if he hasn't buried a hobo in the desert,
I will be unimpressed.
Oh, that's ancient history anyway.
And it was only $45,000.
That's all?
Yup, and he put it back.
You're so bad at this.
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.
I'm transparent as cellophane.
I got to go.
You're kidding.
Nope.
Just remember, Will is like me.
He'll always disappoint you.
Attention, attention...
The microphone is sewn into your collar, Mr. Sweeney.
Just keep your hands away from it.
Mm-hmm, very clever.
Testing, testing!
Just a normal voice, Mr. Sweeney.
Okay, so just to remind you,
Pike you know,
but this fine citizen here is Darryl Boyd,
Pike's lieutenant on the outside.
Pike orders a hit in here, Boyd carries it out on the street.
This is Garfield Park just last week.
You get Pike to admit he ordered the Garfield Park hit,
and I sign your release authorization.
Simple as that, huh?
I'll be right here, Mr. Sweeney, watching.
Anything goes wrong,
just walk away.
They have security guards standing by.
They won't get there in time.
When things happen, Mrs. Florrick, they happen fast.
Well, don't get yourself killed, okay?
Words to live by.
Okay,
Here we go.
Break a leg.
Hey, it's Sweeney.
What's up, paperboy?
It's all right, he's cool.
Donald, hey.
What are you doing here?
Testifying.
Some civil case.
Just an excuse for a vacation, actually.
I talked it up so they'd go for it.
So what's going on with the market?
Did you see HP?
Yeah, don't worry.
Sell at 20 and you'll be fine.
Listen, Donald, I wanted to ask you about something.
Um, I read about Garfield Park in the paper.
Was that you?
What is he doing?
Why you talking about stuff
that don't concern you, Sweeney?
No, no, no, I was just wondering.
Well, don't.
You know, you're funny.
Like a pet.
Don't make me put you down.
I like him.
I like him, too.
He has a good story.
He does-- prison, wrongful conviction,
back from the dead.
He'd make a good keynote.
He speaks well.
He does.
So?
I just don't want him to blow up in our face.
How would he blow up in your face?
His marriage.
Are you hearing something?
Of course I am.
I'm hearing they live apart,
and if I'm hearing it, the Republicans are hearing it, too.
If they were hearing it, they'd use it.
No, they would do what we would do--
release it the day before he speaks.
Of course you don't have an issue with it, Eli.
Peter Florrick is in office.
When he runs for governor, they will use it.
They will use all of it, not just on him but his wife, too.
What if I promised they'd be together?
Is that a promise you can keep?
Yes, it is.
Then we'll consider him for keynote.
Again, Eli, I like him.
He's a thoroughbred,
but I just can't risk... risk.
Okay, here he goes.
We've got about ten minutes before they return
to their cells.
I thought we were done talking.
I-I-I want to know about Garfield Park.
Is he out of his mind?
Look at this guy.
What are you, stupid?
What, are you smoking crack with the brothers?
Get the guard ready.
I think he looks like a snitch.
Think he looks like a snitch?
Go now, Cary.
He's a snitch.
You got to pull him out now.
We pull him out now, no deal.
Wait, listen.
Hey, hey, Donald, I-I didn't mean anything by it.
Why the hell do you keep asking?
'Cause I-I need your help.
You know what they did.
They took my company from me.
Everybody here's got a story, paperboy.
What makes you so special?
I have money...
and I want the man who did this dead.
Gerald Drescher.
He used to be my vice president
until he stabbed me in the back.
You're serious?
How much would it cost?
A guy like that has security.
Oh, nothing worse than the security in Garfield Park.
Uh,
job like that-- it'll cost a lot of money.
That's why I got to know what I'm getting.
Okay, here he goes, nice move.
You're pushing it, Sweeney.
You're in prison.
I'm asking, how can you get it done?
All right, sure.
Garfield Park-- yeah, that was me.
My boy on the outside-- I get word to through my sister.
I give the green light, he does the hit.
A hit on his vice president, huh?
Oh, come on, he had to say something.
You have the release authorization?
Already blessed by Judge Romano.
Pleasure doing business with you.
Is your health issue from the other day better, Mr. Sweeney?
Much better, thank you.
My goodness, I must have made a fuss here.
Food poisoning.
Uh, now, Mr. Sweeney, you testified
that you were present at the IPO meeting?
That's right.
And did you hear any discussion
about the deicing in the wings?
Oh, yes,
I heard everything,
and it's not good.
Good job, I, I hear you saved some kind of case today.
Oh, I just-- we got a settlement.
Great, great.
We should talk sometime.
About?
The future.
What else?
I'm so sorry I'm late.
Thank you for coming back in, Martha.
I just had a few more questions before we decide.
Before you...?
What are you talking about?
They already decided.
I-I'm sorry, what?
I didn't get the job here.
I turned down my other job
because I thought I had this, and now...
I can't believe this.
Well, who told you you didn't get this?
The hiring committee. They called.
Well, there must be some sort of mistake,
because I haven't decided yet.
No, they did.
He said I was close, but they had a vote.
So what happened?
Now, your office is on the 27th floor,
but I want to show you around here first.
Now, this...
Alicia!
Thank you so much.
I am just so thrilled.
David said it was all you.
You picked me, and you're gonna be my mentor.
Yes, Alicia, thank you.
You're welcome.
Anyway, I am really looking forward to working with you.
Thank you again.
I don't get it.
Why put me through the charade...
Alicia..
No. I want to know.
I never had any power, did I?
It was all rigged.
David Lee appealed to the hiring committee,
and the hiring committee voted to go another way.
That's all. It happens.
Which way did you vote?
On what?
The committee voted for Caitlin and against Martha.
Which way did you vote?
I voted with David Lee.
Why?
Because I owed him.
For what?
You don't want to know.
I do want to know.
I feel used, Will.
I feel like I was given a job and it was taken away from me.
There was a Martha
when we hired you, Alicia.
On paper, she was the better candidate
and you were the... Caitlin.
You were gonna lose in a vote.
I asked David Lee to vote with me.
So I owed him.
You okay?
Thank you.
