Well, thank you for dinner, dad.
You're welcome.
Take this. I'm the only one at home.
Oh, Emma, Emma won't need it.
She's on this gluten free thing, dad.
Ian? Oh my god.
Hello there.
What if I had someone here?
Do you?
No.
Then we're in luck.
Oh where have you been?
I'm here now.
Jane.
What do we got?
Father and son.
Son's on the way to the hospital.
That's the dad. Looks like a mugging gone wrong.
You're limping?
What? No.
Waiter I.D.'d them.
Dead guy is Evan Dunbar, son is Chris.
They had dinner, left the restaurant together.
Huh. Did you talk to the son?
No. He was unconscious when they rolled him out.
Mugger pistol-whipped and kicked him.
Manager says the father's a regular, always carries cash.
He had a wad when he paid.
That'd make him a target.
This street is junkie central after dark.
Where is Maura?
Can't do this without your bff?
Well, not when she's the chief medical examiner, no.
Head shot's through. Did you get the bullet?
CSRU recovered it.
It's on its way to ballistics.
Looked like a .38.
Dispatcher's already called Dr. Isles.
I don't know. I'm gonna call the C.I.
He knows this neighborhood really well.
*You're the one I've waited for*
Hel-l-lo, Vanilla.
Hey! Here!
This friggin' guy.
Hey, hey, hey. That's far enough.
Sam, it's all right. He's with us.
Come on, Rondo.
Watch your head, chief.
You just step this way.
I will step anywhere you tell me to step, Vanilla.
You are lookin' fine, today. - Come on. Just --
I like it when you hold me tight.
Stop it. This ain't a date, all right?
I need some information.
I got lots of information,
And I know how to treat a lady right.
Shut up, okay?
Just, look.
I need you to be my eyes and ears on the street, okay?
I need you to be looking for a junkie
that is newly flush with cash or bragging about a murder.
I can't hear much with $20.
There.
I think I'm hearing more.
You know what, Rondo? There. Now, go. Get me something.
Okay. Hey, you get lonely, you know --
Just go! Just --
Hey. Where you been?
Uh, bed.
What? You okay?
Yeah. Why?
Cause you're wearing two different shoes.
You're so not feeling okay.
I got dressed in the dark.
What about you? You're limping.
No, no. I'm not.
Yes, you are. Know why?
Because you buy your boots a half size too small.
No, I don't.
And you stomp.
I do not stomp.
The son regained consciousness at the hospital.
Oh, great. Let's go.
The guy came out of nowhere.
He slammed his gun into my face, and...
I blacked out.
It took 22 stitches to close the gash in his head.
He has a concussion.
He broke his ribs and his fingers.
My father-in-law...
Do you remember anything about your attacker?
Race? Height? Regional accent, a tattoo, anything?
No. It happened so fast. I...
I didn't even see him.
By the time I came to, my dad was dead.
The paramedics were talking to me.
We're very sorry for your loss.
If you remember anything else, please give us a call, okay?
Thank you.
Are you going to get the guy who killed my grandpa?
We're gonna do everything we can.
No. No. I'm not ready yet.
It's beautiful.
I bought it for you at a street market in the Sahel.
You did not.
Yes, I did.
Why don't you ever tell me when you're coming?
Because I never know if I am.
Oh. That's Jane's mother.
Should I hide?
Uh, no.
Uh, just say that we're colleagues.
I don't want to have to explain you.
I'm hard to explain.
Good morning.
Oh. I'm so sorry. I didn't know that --
Uh, no, no, no. It's -- it's okay.
Um, Dr. Faulkner, uh, was just --
Um, he came by for some tea.
Please call me Ian.
Oh. We're just making some black tea.
Would you like some?
Uh, thank you.
You're working early, Dr. Isles.
We were just, um, conferring on a case.
Oh, really? What case is that?
Oh, you know, Angela, uh, is in the middle of, um,
getting certified to become a professional organizer.
Isn't that great?
That's very impressive.
Well, there's no advancement in my field
without continuing education.
Uh-huh, what's your field?
I run the police cafe?.
It's disorganized?
Yes. It's, um, the pantry is a disaster.
Well, we can't have that.
No.
Um, I'm gonna be certified soon,
so if "You're a disorganized, busy professional..."
You mean, um, like Dr. Isles, here?
Yes! Shall we start?
"Are you ready to conquer the clutter?"
Yeah, well, um, I'm just gonna check "Yes."
Look -- stop. I don't care what you have to say.
Nah! Nah! I told them. I'm the one that called it in!
Tell her. I called it in.
He said he was with a "Detective vanilla."
Can't imagine why you didn't just take his word for it.
It's all right. He's with us.
He got to be here?
He does.
Talk.
Well, I've been keeping my ear to the street,
like you told me to,
and I hear about a junkie named Viper
with a bunch of cash.
That must be Viper.
That was Viper.
What do you know about him?
Dope fiend.
Okay, wait right here.
Hmm. .38 special.
Same caliber as the shooting.
Blood on the barrel.
Probably from pistol-whipping Chris Dunbar.
I'll take that bet.
He mugs father and son, uses the cash to buy dope,
and then O.D.'s at a public picnic table.
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking that's odd, aren't you?
Yeah.
Junkies don't shoot dope out in the open.
They're like cockroaches. They hide.
Something's off.
Ah, we're feeling better.
Your shoes match.
I was just tired last night.
You're still limping.
Who's that?
It's not important.
Uh, okay. Well, can we go out on a limb
and say that this junkie O.D.'d?
Yes.
Really?
He overdosed on heroin.
This is from his syringe.
It tested at almost 80% purity.
80%? That's the good stuff.
Pure, non-cut --
How does a street junkie get his hands on that?
I got the print report here.
Oh, can I see that?
Crime lab says junkie's syringe had no fingerprints on it.
Died before he had a chance to wipe them off.
Yeah, so someone wiped them off for him.
Well, you didn't even read it that time.
It's nothing.
You're in a weird mood.
No. I'm not.
Okay.
All right. I got to go talk to my C.I.
You want to grab a coffee afterwards?
No. I already had tea.
Oh.
Did you meet Dr. Isles' new hunk?
What?
Ian.
They think I was born yesterday.
He spent the night.
Okay, ma, that's really none of your bus--
Ian spent the night?
Didn't she tell you?
Yeah.
Yes.
Okay, thanks.
Don't they have Cappuccinos?
No.
Now tell me about Viper.
Where'd he get pure dope?
Mm. Tastes better with foamed milk.
Crap. Buy yourself some foam.
Now -- pure dope.
Oh, word is it hit the street six months ago.
Real good sh-- stuff.
And where's it coming from?
Nobody knows.
All right, um...
You call me if you hear anything, all right?
I got you on speed dial, vanilla.
Okay.
Ballistics confirmed the gun we found on the dead junkie
was the murder weapon used to kill Evan Dunbar
and beat up his son, Chris.
Well, what about gunshot residue?
Did it confirm that the junkie was the shooter?
No. The opposite. Very little gsr on the dead junkie.
So the gun was planted.
Seems like it.
Well, maybe we're not looking at a random mugging.
Maybe we're looking at a hit.
What do we know about the victim's business?
Bostonia shipping logistics -- our victim handled
freight and customs brokering for small businesses.
His son, Chris, worked for him.
Is the company clean?
Very. Checked I.C.E.,
D.E.A., Drug Control Unit.
Nothing. Not a whiff of anything sketchy.
You said the son, Chris, worked for the dad?
You think he had someone beat his face to a pulp?
I don't know. I mean, father owns the business.
If he dies, the son inherits it.
So, a few blows to the face.
Dad's a widower, Chris is an only child.
There's another relative. Victim had a brother, Arthur.
Well, that's a prison mug shot. What's he in for?
Mandatory 10 years for dealing cocaine.
Oh, wait. Look at this.
Company's clean, but the victim wasn't.
He was indicted with his brother.
Yeah, but look. Evan didn't do time.
Because the D.A. gave him immunity
for testifying against his brother, Arthur.
Damn. Our victim put his own brother away.
When does Arthur get out?
Six weeks ago.
Probably pretty pissed off after 10 years in the slammer.
That's a good motive for murder. Let's bring him in.
Won't be easy. Guy's off the grid.
No driver's license, no bank accounts. Not seeing anything.
Get creative. We got to find him.
It's Maura. She got something on the vic.
Evan Dunbar had an odd residue
on his shoe bottoms and pant cuffs -- cyanoacrylate powder,
used almost exclusively in nail salons.
So our shooting victim visited a nail salon
before he was killed.
It appears so, although his nails didn't look like
they've ever been touched by an emery board.
Is that Ian?
Uh, let's go and take a look at the victim's nails.
Oh, let's.
Yes, it was Ian. He's just an old friend.
Hm. His cuticles have never been cut.
I'd say he's never had a manicure.
You don't have to tell me about Ian.
It's none of my business.
I'm not not telling you about him.
He just stopped by this morning.
I heard he stopped by last night.
Uh he lives in Africa.
It's, um...
It's complicated.
Uh, let me know if you find anything else
in the case, you know, that's not complicated.
I mean, who am I to help you with your complicated love life?
Jane.
Goodbye.
Have a fabulous time reading your love texts in private.
No, Jane. Jane, wait. Wait. It's nothing.
It's nothing. Look.
He just said, "Guess what we'd be doing
if we were in ethiopia right now."
That doesn't sound complicated.
I killed Korsak with your scalpel.
I contaminated all your DNA samples.
I snuck into your closet,
and I put all your shoes in different boxes.
What?!
Never mind.
What? No. Jane. Jane, wait. Wait, wait. I'm sorry.
Let me at least take a look at your foot.
Oh, no. I don't think we're close enough for that anymore.
Please? I'm -- I'm sorry. Okay?
Look, I'm...
You'll really sorry when my toe kills me.
Don't touch it.
Maura.
Okay, you have acute onychocryptosis.
Do I need to update my will?
Ingrown toenail. You need a minor procedure.
Okay, you do it.
Me? I don't do surgery.
It's not a kidney transplant, Maura. Just do it!
Not gonna ask.
What...is it?
Chris Dunbar is checking out of the hospital.
How? He was in critical condition yesterday.
Can you believe the insurance company is kicking him out?
Yeah. They said if I can get myself to the bathroom,
then I don't need a hospital.
Any news on the case?
We're working some leads.
Your father ever go to a nail salon?
My father? No. No, he wasn't that kind of guy. Why?
Come on, Aidan.
Let's go outside. We'll meet daddy out front.
Did your father and you ever have any personal difficulties?
No. No, we always got along.
What about business disagreements?
Why would you be asking me this? We were mugged.
It's possible it wasn't random.
Can you think of anyone
that might have wanted to hurt your father?
No. No one.
How about your uncle Arthur? Have you seen him recently?
No. I haven't --
I haven't seen my uncle since he went to prison.
And did he ever threaten your father?
I mean, they had their issues, but no.
I mean, I -- I don't believe
Arthur would kill his brother or hurt me.
There's...just no way.
Thank you.
Take good care of yourself. We'll be in touch. Thanks.
Pretty crummy insurance, just throwing him out in that condition.
Well, he has minimal coverage, but he's covered till tomorrow.
Why'd his doctors release him, then?
They didn't. He's leaving A.M.A.
Against medical advice.
So why'd he lie?
Yeah, and why is he in such a hurry to get out?
Thank you.
I had a mani-pedi once.
So you're that kind of guy.
Had to get close to a drug dealer
who did business over pedicures -- got a fungus!
Did you at least make the arrest?
He got four years. I got yellow toes.
Here he comes.
What's he doing?
I don't know.
Bye, dad!
He's in a hurry to go somewhere.
He's pulling a container out of customs' holding.
Must be pretty important.
Look at the guy. He's having trouble walking.
Yeah. Something smells.
We got to get a look in that container.
Hey, Frost.
I need you to get me a search warrant.
What's going on?
We were gonna ask you the same thing.
We need to take a look inside the container.
Jane!
I got the manifest -- ugh!
Rats! There's rats in there.
"Ooh, eek! A rat! Help! Help! Help!"
Stop.
What's the shipment?
Deliveries from China
for four different Boston customers.
You got a toy store, jewelry store,
Furniture store, and...
"Lee's nail spa."
Wow. That's something since
our victim was in a nail salon
before he was killed.
Stay away from nail salons.
Stop talking about your nasty toes.
At least I'm not afraid of rodents.
Anything?
Nothing. No drugs.
Damn it.
We got to find time to go through all the boxes.
I think the clock ran out.
We can't seize the container
without probable cause.
Then we got to find something fast.
You said that your father had never been in a nail salon.
Yeah, he hasn't.
All right, well, one of your clients
owns a nail salon.
You're delivering a shipment to "Lee's nail spa."
Yeah, I don't know all of our clients.
All right, but I did just speak to my attorney.
Now, unless you found any drugs, which you won't,
You need to release this container back to me.
Port agent says you've never
signed for a container before.
This one must be special.
This business feeds my family,
and now it's all I have left of my father.
So, yeah, I'm gonna take care of our clients.
Jane?
Yeah.
I got a whole shipment of these.
Good, 'cause he's hiding something.
Nice save, Frost.
These studded bracelets
are illegal in Massachusetts.
So they're for a shop in New Hampshire.
Punk rock accessory in New Hampshire,
dangerous weapon in Massachusetts.
I'm so sorry. We're gonna have to impound this entire container.
You gonna hear from my attorney.
Call CSRU. We take everything.
What are you doing here?
My toe. It's killing me.
Unless it's given you a staph infection,
it's hardly killing you.
What? D-- oh!
I'm...so sorry to barge in.
No, it's okay.
Hey, you must be Jane Rizzoli.
Let me get you a glass of wine.
Okay. Thank you. Uh, you must be Ian.
Jane needs a phenolisation procedure.
Ooh, then you're gonna want a lot of wine.
I'd better open another bottle.
Did you come over here to check up on me?
Oh, yeah, I rubbed bad germs all over my ingrown toenail
so I could spy on you.
Um, Maura, I can't find the corkscrew.
Your mother has been doing some organizing for me.
Oh, god, can't she find a slob to...
...bother?
I'm so sorry.
It's okay.
She alphabetized everything.
So now corkscrew is next to the chopsticks.
Hey, um, let me, uh, see that foot while I open the wine.
Okay.
What can I use to do the procedure?
Huh? Oh, I-I -- I thought Maura was gonna do it.
Uh, Ian is much more qualified.
I just got a new pair of carbon steel pruning sheers.
But would that be under "C"
or "S"?
Uh, "P"?
I guess that makes sense.
"P" For "Pruning."
Cute.
What, are you gonna cut off my toe?
It's pretty much the same tool the podiatrists use.
Okay, so I'm gonna need some betadine
and a topical anesthetic spray.
Well, you've got your own traveling pharmacy over there.
Uh, Ian is taking some supplies back to Africa.
Oh.
This is gonna feel a little bit cold.
Oh-kay. No, that's fine.
Oh, I'll need, uh, a toothpick, too.
What -- what -- what for?
Now hold still 'cause this might pinch a little bit.
You really got a grip on it, don't you, doc?
When do I take the toothpick out?
A day.
It's keeping the nail away from the wound.
It might smart a little.
No, what, really?
Because you dug into my toe with pruning sheers?
The periungual's sensitive.
Are you sure you don't want to stay for dinner?
Um, no, no, I've lost my appetite.
You two kids have fun.
Thanks, ma.
Oh, hey. You're looking for dr. Maura Isles.
Give it to me. I'll take it to her.
Ma!
What? It's from Ian.
Wow. Two-buck chuck and three rolls of toilet paper.
Romance lives.
She's more secretive about this one, isn't she?
No.
Yes.
Hurts your feelings
that she's not confiding in you.
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
I don't care.
You know, I -- I don't need to know every detail of her personal life.
It's all right.
But she usually tells you.
Yeah.
He seems charming.
But, you know, those are the ones you have to worry about.
I got a really weird vibe from him.
He was unpacking boxes.
And then when he saw me, he just closed 'em all up.
It was like...
That's your cop gut.
Maybe he's a criminal.
I don't know.
Well, he is Australian.
Uh, aren't they all descended from crooks?
Ma, that was like 200 years ago,
And I don't think we can hold that against him.
You know, while I'm in there organizing,
I could poke around.
Please don't do that.
I hear you loud and clear. You need deniability.
Ma, no.
No! Wh--
Ma-- maura!
Maura!
That must be from Ian.
This Ian really knows how to woo a girl.
When we did relief work together in Ethiopia,
We'd talk about what we'd give
for some cheap wine and toilet paper.
How come you never told me about him?
I'm sure I have. You must've forgotten.
Thanks for this.
What's up?
Chris Dunbar's not happy we impounded his shipment.
He's threatening legal action if we don't release it.
Any luck finding uncle Arthur?
Nothing from social security.
No phone, not any paying utilities.
Well, what about a -- a -- a discount card,
A pharmacy, a sweepstakes entry?
Everybody signs up for something.
I'll keep digging.
So we're back to that one lead -- nails.
Well, we know our victim was in a nail salon before he died.
And we know he shipped supplies for Lee's Nail Spa.
Let's go talk to "Lee."
Yes, that's Mr. Dunbar.
We wondered what happened to our supplies.
And you two are business partners?
How long have you been using his shipping service?
A few years. Good prices, reliable.
He was a nice man.
Your supplies come from china?
Yes, uh, you'd be amazed what the profit margin is on hand oils and candles.
I bet.
Excuse me. Mani-pedi today?
Handy we both have toe problems.
We're in a nail salon.
How about a complimentary service?
No, sorry. We're not allowed to accept gifts.
And plus my friend here had a bad experience.
Fungus.
Ah, gives the industry a bad name.
I've tried everything --
Mouthwash, vapor rub, hemorrhoid cream.
R-- hemorrhoid cream?
I'd do anything to get rid of it.
So you can wear your strappy sandals?
Use this, three times a day.
112 bucks?!
Small price to pay.
Rizzoli.
Never doubt the power of greed.
I never do. Did you find uncle Arthur?
You were right.
He filled out a publisher's clearing house entry.
Gave them his work address.
Evan's dead? What happened?
Where were you two nights ago around 9:00 P.M.?
I was working here. My shift ends at 11:00.
What happened to my brother?
We were hoping you may have had a thought.
No, we really haven't been in touch.
Since he testified against you.
I don't harbor hard feelings.
But you didn't reach out to him after 10 years in prison.
I was going to.
I just needed to get my feet on the ground.
You know... Evan was the responsible one.
He took over the business when dad died.
He worked hard. He found a way to make a little profit.
But not a big enough profit.
Is that when the two of you started dealing coke?
Evan had nothing to do with that.
But he testified against you.
Seems like that might have made you angry.
He had no choice, okay? I told him to.
What about your nephew?
When's the last time you saw Chris?
I'm a convicted drug dealer.
I figured a little distance was good for everybody.
Now it's too late.
This is the last of the container.
They've been through everything.
More rats.
So we have no evidence,
and our best suspect, uncle Arthur, has three witnesses
who put him at his auto repair job at the time of the murder.
Their coats are glossy.
Healthy gums.
They ate rat poison, Maura.
No, this isn't from rodenticide.
Even fast-acting poison takes a few days.
These rats died immediately after ingesting something.
Something in the container.
Maybe you should do an autopsy.
Technically, it's a necroscopy.
Well, let's not tell the taxpayers
what we're doing with their tax dollars.
Got another delivery for you, doc.
Uh, can you put it in my office, please?
Sure.
What is that?
Supplies.
For Ian?
Yes.
For Ian...
Who fixed your toe.
How is your toe?
How is your conscience?
Excuse me?
What are you doing? Who is this guy?
Why are you being so weird?
Why are you turning into a snoopy dog?
Do you mean Snoop Dogg or Snoopy, the dog?
Either way, I'm insulted.
Too insulted to find out what killed your rats?
Okay, that is so not fair.
High levels of diacetylmorphine in the rats' blood.
Heroin. The rats O.D.'d.
I've heard of cases where smugglers
soak clothes in liquid heroin.
Both rats had grayish blue fibers in their stomachs.
They ate the blankets in the container.
How much do you want to bet
this thing is soaked in liquid heroin?
Nothing. I don't bet if I can't win.
But why didn't the drug dog hit on the scent?
Because the scent of any animal would throw the dogs off.
So fill the container with rats.
Smart.
I bet Chris Dunbar thought he'd figured out
how to smuggle heroin into the country.
I want my lawyer.
Better be a good one.
We just found $2 million worth of heroin
in your container.
You don't understand.
So explain.
Start with your father's murder
and finish when you get to the part about the dead junkie.
I get a phone call.
I want to talk to my lawyer.
Be my guest.
Jane!
Ian is a spy.
What did you do, ma?
I found passports from different countries
all with his photo and all with different names.
You shouldn't have done this, ma.
What is that smell?
It's my foot solution.
It's like a skunk made love to a farting dog.
Hey, I'm fighting a war down here.
What is the smell?
Combat under his desk.
Did you poke around in Chris Dunbar's finances?
Just found a transaction
he completed this morning that makes no sense.
Looks like he took out a line of credit on his business
so he could withdraw 2 million bucks.
Right before we arrested him?
Wait. It does make sense.
Heroin we impounded is worth about $2 million.
Yeah. And if Chris doesn't deliver the drugs,
he's got to deliver the cash.
Who's his lawyer? He called him from downstairs.
I'll check the phone records.
Can you have your Interpol contact run these names?
Sure.
Ian Smith. Ian Walters.
Ian Franklin.
Mm. Same guy. I think he's Australian national.
You think there's an Australian connection here?
You're not gonna believe this.
Chris didn't call a lawyer.
Who'd he call?
He dialed his own cell.
Well, we better find who has that phone.
Come on. We'll take Maura's car.
What's wrong with yours?
It's a cop car.
You're right.
Prius is a great undercover vehicle.
E.V. Mode.
Mm. So quiet I can
hear your toenails crying back there.
Roomy, too.
Well, don't take off your shoes.
Okay, GPS tracking shows the phone
is moving down that alley.
It's coming right at us.
My Interpol contact has something for you.
Your Australian is wanted for questioning.
What?
Hello, uncle Arthur.
Looks like he's headed right back to the nail salon.
Take the back. We'll get the front.
Give me the money!
I don't like this.
Drop the gun! Now!
Put it down! Put it down!
Clear!
Frost, get an ambulance.
Victor 810. I need EMS down here.
It's all right. It's all right.
Okay, okay. The paramedics are on their way.
He has Emma and Aidan.
Chris' wife and son?
Yes
Who has them?
Who? I don't know.
He killed my brother.
He wants the money.
Where are they? Where are they?
She's the only one that knew.
Lee had a business partner. Ted.
I don't know who Ted is.
All right. Please, you have to help me.
We cannot find your wife and child
if you're just gonna sit here and keep lying to us, chris.
All right. Wait.
Wait.
How long have you and your father
been moving heroin in those containers?
He had nothing to do with it.
All right, it was all me.
Right, and it was just this one time.
And Lee was your connection?
Yeah.
My father introduced me to all of his clients.
And Lee, she said that she had a way
for me to make some easy money.
By smuggling dope.
Yeah. Yeah, as you can see, a real easy way
to make a couple million bucks.
It would have worked, too,
except my father, he was so precise.
He noticed on the manifest
that the container from China was off by 50 pounds.
Because you put 50 pounds
of heroin-soaked blankets inside.
We found some residue from the nail salon
on your father's clothing.
He went to see Lee the day he was shot, didn't he?
Yeah. I told him not to go.
But he said that there was no way
that he was gonna accept delivery of her container.
Well, got him killed.
Maybe you should have talked to us.
Oh, come on. I couldn't talk to you.
The guy who shot my dad,
he said I was next
if I didn't get him the container.
And what did he look like?
I didn't see his face.
I'm telling you the truth!
Did you tell your uncle the truth, too?
You nearly got him killed.
He was just trying to help.
All right, I called him when my family was taken.
All right, I didn't know what else to do.
Arthur said that he would do it.
All right, he said that he would bring Lee the money.
And you let him.
Please, you have to find my family, right?
They didn't do anything wrong.
It's Maura. She says she's got something.
Lee had a poultry mite infestation on both arms.
Clearly it's a few months old.
How? She worked in a nail salon.
What, she get it from a customer?
No. She could only contract it
if she worked around poultry.
Like a slaughterhouse or a packing plant?
Maybe there's a slaughterhouse
or a packing plant next to the nail salon.
Check it, Frost.
Well, she'd need a place to process the heroin.
Yeah. She'd need a chemical bath,
a heating source, drying tables.
Got something.
Only one slaughterhouse in the Boston area.
Right near the nail salon.
Health department shut it down six months ago.
Utilities are still on.
Good place to dry out your heroin and hide people.
Speaking of hiding,
Ian is wanted for questioning by interpol
for stealing drugs.
You've been investigating me?
Jane.
I'm coming.
Where are they?!
Go to hell.
Let's do it again. Where are they?!
I'm gonna count to three.
One.
Two.
You don't have the guts.
You don't know her at all.
Three!
In the freezer in the back!
You okay?
They're in the freezer.
Not enough of a profit margin
on hand oils and candles, huh, Ted?
Emma...
Aidan.
Hey. It's okay. It's okay.
It's over.
Mommy.
It's okay.
Where's dad?
You okay?
Where's Ian?
He's gone.
I harbored a fugitive.
So go ahead and arrest me.
I'm sorry.
Because you won't be able to arrest him?
Man, you got it bad.
You know when people talk about the loves of their lives?
That's Ian.
You never, ever mentioned him.
'Cause I try to forget him.
I'm sorry, Maura. I shouldn't have done what I did.
It's none of my business.
I just -- I can't...
I can't talk about him.
I can't. With anybody.
Because it makes me so sad.
I mean, how can you -- how can you love someone
and not be able to be with them?
Well, why can't you be with him?
Because he went back to Africa.
Well, you could go to Africa.
You know, his crime is risking his life
to bring drugs and basic supplies
to places that nobody cares about.
And I helped him, so go ahead and arrest me.
The first person I'm gonna arrest is my mother.
What, really? "High ball glasses"?
When is the last time you had a high ball?
Come on.
She rearranged my closet, too.
No. Not the closet.
She threw away my shoe boxes.
Well, now, that is a crime.
I'm sorry.
You want me to take you to the airport?
No.
No.
You want me to sit with you till you feel better?
Yeah.
But first can you arrest your mother?
Okay.
Thank you.
