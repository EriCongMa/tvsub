i think you &apos;re a lousy mother .
gaby was insulted .
did you just say that to my face ?
i closed the door to ask
if you would like to be my new senior v.p.
lynette choose not to mention her pregnancy
you get to stay in school .
susan tried to protect julie .
you shot me !
that gun is under our real name .
i wanna call the police .
uh , just ...
and angie had to protect her secret .
high road all the way .
that &apos;s a good point .
bree hodge had a problem .
she did not want to fall in love with karl mayer .
she was appalled by his table manners ...
what ?
his personal ethics ...
what ?
and his wandering eye .
what ?
no , bree did not want to fall for karl mayer ,
and yet she knew in her heart
that she was starting to .
and that &apos;s why she also knew
the time had come ...
we have to talk .
to leave .
hey , what &apos;s with the face ? you dumping me ?
karl ...
oh , my god . you are dumping me .
we &apos;ve both known this couldn &apos;t last forever ,
so let &apos;s end it now before someone gets hurt .
but it &apos;s going so well .
i feel we &apos;re getting closer .
we are .
that &apos;s the problem .
when i agreed to be your lover ,
i felt quite sure that my disdain for your vulgarity
and astounding lack of scruples would preclude
any chance of my developing feelings for you .
but against all reason , it &apos;s happening .
i don &apos;t want to fall in love with a man
i &apos;m not even sure i like .
i &apos;m glad we &apos;re being careful about no one getting hurt .
please , let &apos;s not make this any harder than it has to be .
okay . you say we &apos;re done , we &apos;re done .
i was gonna wait to give you this later ,
maybe over dinner or something .
i guess now it &apos;s sort of a parting gift .
i couldn &apos;t .
open it .
it &apos;s beautiful !
oh , and it &apos;s inscribed .
&quot; to my dear and beloved ... irene &quot; ?
irene was my grandmother .
my grandpa gave it to her on their
first wedding anniversary .
well , she had no granddaughters , so she willed it to me .
she said , &quot; someday you &apos;ll find
the perfect woman to give this to , &quot; and she was right .
i know how you feel .
i &apos;m--i didn &apos;t plan on falling for you , either .
and i don &apos;t blame you
for wanting to run the other way .
and for what it &apos;s worth ...
i love you .
and in that moment ,
bree knew that the time to leave her lover had come ...
and gone .
ann peterson
was the principal of fairview elementary school ,
and she believed in rules .
she used them to teach hygiene ,
to control behavior
and to instill order .
yes , mrs. peterson believed in rules .
she also believed
that those who didn &apos;t follow them should be punished .
okay , the camera is rolling .
are there any words you &apos;d like to say
before your daughter makes her stage debut ?
let us pray .
gaby , juanita is going to see this .
oh , trust me this is not the footage you wanna keep .
well , i &apos;m sorry . i tried to work with her .
but you may as well know your daughter is talent @-@ free .
she is only 7 . how bad could she be ?
well , i &apos;ve already looked through the program
to pick out a kid we can pretend is ours .
i like paige glover . i &apos;m gonna be her mommy .
my name is miles standish .
we have come to share with you our bounty .
and to give thanks for this new lands ,
where we are free from religious perskacootion .
which one is paige glover ?
shh , shh .
religious perspacotion .
where we are free from religious ...
persecution !
read the corn ! i wrote it on the corn !
per--perska ... prossa ... aw--
at that moment ,
juanita solis chose to utter a certain 4 @-@ letter word ...
for the very first time .
i did not write that on the corn .
just promise me
you won &apos;t have a few drinks and get all kissy with me
like you did last week at the bermans &apos; .
you told me you don &apos;t want our friends to know
we &apos;re having marital problems .
well , you don &apos;t have to maul me to prove we &apos;re okay .
i don &apos;t like public displays of affection .
i know .
but these days , they &apos;re the only kind i can get from you .
sorry we &apos;re late , mike .
oh , that &apos;s okay , come on in .
oh , my god . i can &apos;t believe it .
it &apos;s just a pie , susan . i &apos;ve brought them before .
no , the brooch that you &apos;re wearing .
it &apos;s ... it &apos;s mine .
excuse me ?
karl gave it to me years ago . can i see it ?
well , i don &apos;t doubt that it &apos;s similar , susan ,
but it can &apos;t possibly be the same one .
no , yes ! there &apos;s the inscription .
to his granny irene ! mike !
this is the same brooch i lost ten years ago .
you say you lost it ?
yeah . it was back when karl and i got divorced .
one day it was on my coat , and the next ... gone .
i never knew where it went .
hi , everybody .
well , now we know .
great to see you . see you , sweetheart .
hey , karl , get in here . wait .
you are not gonna believe this .
bree found your grandmother &apos;s brooch .
what ?
yes , the one that susan lost .
what an extraordinary coincidence .
where did you get it , bree ?
she bought it . i &apos;m assuming .
uh , yes , at that little antique store
down on pearl street .
yeah , so obviously ,
whoever found it must &apos;ve sold it to that store .
remember how mad you got when i lost it ?
he really yelled at me .
you yelled at her ?
i don &apos;t recall yelling .
you kinda did .
&quot; how could you lose my grandmother &apos;s brooch ? !
it was a family heirloom ! &quot; - unbelievable .
yeah , that it would turn up again after all this time .
well , i &apos;m glad i can give it back to its rightful owner .
oh , it &apos;s yours . you bought it .
oh , i couldn &apos;t possibly wear it
knowing that karl gave it to you .
well , how much did it cost ? i &apos;ll reimburse you .
no need , dear . trust me , it was a steal .
whoa ! we gotta get him inside .
shh . shh . just hold on . just ...
okay . easy does it .
how can we get some pancakes ?
what ? oh , gee .
watch it . watch it .
i &apos;m good , i &apos;m good .
shh .
porter , for god sakes !
people are trying to sleep !
tom ?
hey , honey .
what are you doing here ?
i thought you were gonna be at the library studying .
w @-@ w @-@ we were , and after we were done ,
i told the guys i &apos;d treat &apos; em to pancakes .
but the ... the place was closed .
ah , so we peed on the building .
give it five , t @-@ scav ! yo !
you &apos;re drunk .
uh , i beg your pardon .
he &apos;s drunk . i &apos;m faced .
do you have a sink ?
what did this library have , a 3 @-@ drink minimum ?
well , after the library , we went to a bar ,
and they got into a cutthroat game of beer pong .
well , i &apos;ll just make &apos; em some pancakes
and take &apos; em home in the morning .
the morning ? !
can i talk to you a second , t @-@ scav ,
away from these beer pong champs ?
actually , they lost and--and it was kind of controversial--
i don &apos;t care ! they &apos;re not staying here tonight .
come on ! look at niedermeyer .
i can &apos;t take him home to his mom and dad .
you know how parents are .
of course i do ! we &apos;re parents !
look ...
i understand you want the kids to like you
so they can elect you homecoming king or whatever ,
but you are not going back to school
to have some second childhood . enough is enough !
okay . okay , i hear ya .
hey , i hear you , too . wanna keep it down ?
and as punishment ,
i &apos;m having juanita draft a letter of apology
to every classmate and family member who heard ...
the verb in question .
that seems fair .
and of course , she won &apos;t be allowed to participate
in the final two performances of the thanksgiving pageant .
of course .
and she is also on cafeteria cleaning detail
for the next two weeks .
absolutely .
uh , not so fast .
i &apos;m sorry ?
oh , come on , mrs. peterson .
a letter of apology ? fine .
taking her out of the play ?
hey , she deserved that based on her performance alone .
but let &apos;s not go overboard .
mrs. solis , this school has a zero tolerance policy
when it comes to profanity .
and we respect that . right , honey ?
stay out of this , sweetheart .
you need to take a second look at that policy .
juanita made a little slip . it wasn &apos;t intentional .
it &apos;s not like she flipped the bird afterwards .
my ruling stands .
if you can &apos;t do the time , don &apos;t do the crime .
what is this , shawshank elementary ?
this school is not at fault .
if you want to assign blame ,
you might look to your dubious parenting skills .
oh , i wish you hadn &apos;t said that .
excuse me ?
well , juanita learned that word somewhere .
and you &apos;re saying i taught it to her ?
no , i &apos;m sure it was whispered to her by the wind .
let me tell you something , mrs. peterson .
i am pulling juanita
out of this crappy , crappy school !
come on , carlos ! oh .
&quot; crappy , &quot; huh ?
what a shame juanita won &apos;t be here
to blurt that out during the pledge of allegiance .
oh , yeah ? well , here &apos;s a blurt for ya--
... and the horse you rode in on !
don &apos;t shoot ! it &apos;s just me .
relax , susan . it was a joke .
is mike here ?
he is out on a job .
oh , darn it .
i wanted to talk to both of you so i could apologize .
over the past few weeks ...
i &apos;ve let my emotions get the best of me .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ve noticed
that my behavior has been ... crazy .
hmm , just in the ... clinical sense .
well , that &apos;s over .
i don &apos;t want there to be any more tension between us .
when we see each other on the street ,
i want us to wave ,
not dive behind a garbage can .
oh , i didn &apos;t dive . i ... just dropped my keys .
i just want things to be normal again .
let me play poker with you and the girls .
if you throw a party , invite me .
maybe you and mike can have me
over for a barbecue sometime .
given what &apos;s happened ,
i just don &apos;t see a barbecue in our future .
fine , susan .
i was just hoping to be friends again
and show all those people how wrong they were .
what people ?
the ones who keep telling me that
i should sue you for , uh ...
what did they call it ? &quot; reckless endangerment &quot; ?
yeah , i &apos;m sorry . who are all these people ?
neighbors , well @-@ wishers ,
a couple of lawyers who dabble in civil lawsuits .
but i told them , &quot; no , i could never sue susan . &quot;
in spite of everything , we &apos;re still friends .
but ... if that isn &apos;t true anymore ...
brunch ! uh ...
mike and i aren &apos;t really barbecue people .
we like a good brunch .
so ... let &apos;s give that a shot .
um , i &apos;m sorry . that was just a bad choice of words .
i love it ! sunday around 11 : 00 ?
i &apos;ll bring a quiche .
great .
aren &apos;t you glad i &apos;m not crazy anymore ?
oh , yeah . this is so much better .
we are over , karl .
and this time i mean it .
oh , come on , bree .
you &apos;re gonna dump me over a lousy brooch ?
it &apos;s not the brooch , karl . it &apos;s you .
stealing susan &apos;s jewelry
and then berating her for losing it ?
what kind of man does that ?
how about a man whose wife &apos;s taking him to the cleaners ,
who wants to get back a little of
what she &apos;s costing him ?
but how could you be so stupid as to then give it to me ?
did it not occur to you that she might see me wearing it ?
hey , when susie and i divorced ,
she lost a lot of things .
i forgot the brooch was one of them .
that &apos;s your defense
that you stole so much , you lost track ?
let &apos;s not forget who had no problem
staging a fake burglary to protect her stuff from orson .
well , i am not proud of that .
i am even less proud of letting
my libido blind me to the fact
that i have been fornicating
with a morally bankrupt weasel .
well , not anymore . we &apos;re done .
wait .
bree ...
will you marry me ?
excuse me ?
i know , not the best time to ask .
but i was scared if i waited , i wouldn &apos;t get another shot .
do you think for one instant i would even--
don &apos;t feel you need to answer right away .
i &apos;m pretty sure
what the short @-@ term response would be . but , um ...
i love you , bree .
for god sakes , karl .
and i &apos;d be honored if you &apos;d even
consider becoming my wife .
no . i &apos;m not done .
the man who swiped that brooch
that was the man i was .
the man i am now is a little better ,
but he is nothing compared to the man that i could be
with a woman like you as my wife .
there . done .
karl--
don &apos;t say anything .
just go . think it over .
i only wanna say--
bup , bup , bup !
just think .
i hope i &apos;m not disturbing you .
i just want to thank you for the ...
oh . are you okay ?
you &apos;re crying . what &apos;s wrong ?
no , nothing . what &apos;s up ?
oh , okay .
i just wanted to tell you how well our plan is working .
our plan ?
yeah , the one about taking the high road with susan .
i was just over there . she doesn &apos;t have a clue .
who &apos;s that ?
my mother .
oh ! where does she live ?
she doesn &apos;t .
i &apos;m sorry .
tomorrow would &apos;ve been her birthday .
every year this time i get a little depressed .
so let &apos;s go out . i &apos;ll buy you lunch .
it &apos;s the least i can do for my partner in crime .
okay , you gotta stop with that .
what ?
this &quot; our plan , &quot; &quot; partner in crime . &quot;
this is your thing with susan .
you do what you wanna do .
oh , you &apos;re just upset because of your mother .
you know what ?
i &apos;ll bake you a pineapple upside down cake .
best thing in the world for depression !
well , i called every private school in the area .
no openings until september .
damn it , gaby .
you couldn &apos;t wait till summer to cuss out the principal ?
i make no apologies . she had it coming .
and i &apos;d do it again .
she attacked our daughter .
well , i &apos;m glad you &apos;re so devoted to juanita ,
&apos;cause you &apos;re about to be spending
a whole lot more time together .
what are you talking about ?
i think we have other choice .
you &apos;re gonna have to homeschool her .
that &apos;s funny . oh , you &apos;re good , carlos .
we needed something to cut the tension .
but seriously , what do we do ?
seriously ? we enroll online ,
they send us the curriculum , and you teach her .
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . before this gets ugly ,
you do realize i don &apos;t know how to teach .
really ? you taught juanita a few choice words .
me ? how about you ?
what a blank of a day !
earl at the office is such a blank .
i wanna kick the blank out of his blank .
oh , yeah ? how about , that blanking hairdresser
totally screwed up my blanking hair !
look at me ! i &apos;m totally blanked !
the blanking client didn &apos;t sign the deal ,
and we lost a blankload of money .
wah ! blank , blank , blank !
okay . we are both at fault .
but you &apos;re homeschooling her .
fine ,
but i know someone who isn &apos;t getting blanked tonight .
fine with me .
i blanked off earlier .
thanks again for the pie .
you &apos;re welcome .
so i see you &apos;re wearing the brooch .
i must say it was awfully sweet of karl
to give you his grandmother &apos;s jewelry .
when you were married ,
did he do that sort of thing often
surprise you with little gifts ?
constantly .
really ?
yeah , of course , after a while i knew that it just meant
that he &apos;d cheated and was feeling guilty .
once he went to barbados and brought me back
a pair of sapphire earrings . i cried for days .
so ... why the sudden fascination with karl ?
oh , i &apos;m hardly fascinated , just curious .
when you talk about your marriage to him ,
it &apos;s always about the lies and the cheating ,
and you never really talk about the good times .
well , there were wonderful times .
yeah , he was always a good kisser ,
and he could always make me laugh .
you know , the truth is , if he had begged my forgiveness ...
i mean , if just once ...
he had told me that he was willing to change ...
oh ! the hell with karl .
in fact , um ...
here .
no , susan . it &apos;s yours .
no , it &apos;s karl &apos;s .
and the only jewelry i should be wearing now is mike &apos;s .
well , if you insist .
and by the way , thanks .
it felt good to say a few nice things about
karl for a change , you know .
well , it was nice to hear them .
here you go , gaby . it &apos;s kinda old .
it &apos;s from before the soviet union broke up .
the soviet union broke up ?
you sure you know what you &apos;re doing
with this homeschooling thing ?
oh , honey , juanita &apos;s in first grade .
she &apos;ll believe what i tell her .
hey , your phone. oh !
ooh . i popped my button .
actually , lynette , i &apos;m not surprised .
what ?
well , i wasn &apos;t gonna bring it up ,
but ... you have been getting a little rounder lately .
well , what can i tell you , gaby ?
i &apos;m working long hours , i &apos;m not exercising ,
eating a bunch of junk at work .
yeah , i wouldn &apos;t be surprised
if she gets even bigger than this .
don &apos;t you have some homework ?
actually , i &apos;ve gotta pick up some books at the library .
good . i &apos;ll clean up .
bye .
seriously , lynette , you can lose this weight in one month .
no , gaby , i really can &apos;t .
yes , you can , and i &apos;m gonna help you .
what do you say we meet every morning at 7 : 00
and go for a run ?
i don &apos;t know . that &apos;s right around the time
i &apos;m getting the kids ready for school .
lynette , you cannot let this go .
you know the expression
&quot; the longer you wait , the bigger the butt . &quot;
if you &apos;ll excuse me , i have to get that .
it might be another friend
calling to tell me my ass is too fat .
well , i &apos;m just trying to help .
all right . bye . i love you .
hello ?
no , t @-@ scav just left .
this is l @-@ scav . may i help you ?
i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry . what party ?
oh ! niedermeyer ! mahoney !
hey , mrs. scavo .
hi .
would you like a slice of long island watermelon ?
gosh , tempting , but i just wanna find my husband
and bring him home .
uh , he &apos;s not here .
don &apos;t cover for him .
somebody called our house wanting to know
why he hadn &apos;t shown up with the keg yet .
brilliant .
niedermeyer , please . tom has actual responsibilities .
his jell @-@ o shots and beer pong days are over ,
and i don &apos;t appreciate his new buddies
making him think they &apos;re not .
he &apos;s not our buddy .
i don &apos;t care . i just wanna know where he is .
he just dropped off the keg and left .
well--wait ! wait !
if he &apos;s not your friend , why is he buying you a keg ?
why is he making you dinner at our house ?
okay , boys .
no ! oh , no , no , no !
without this watermelon ,
all these pretty girls will stay sober ,
and we know what that means .
no ! no ! okay ! okay ! we &apos;ll tell you !
dude , she &apos;s got our melon !
tom &apos;s doing stuff for us
because gave him the answers to the midterm .
he &apos;s cheating off you ?
no. we &apos;ve got a connection in the math department .
we get the tests .
wait , uh , mrs. scavo , can we get our watermelon back ?
you coming to bed ?
just a sec .
oh . so exhausted .
oh . okay .
no , no , no. wait. wait . i am not that exhausted .
oh. okay .
delfino plumbing .
uh , yeah . well , exactly what &apos;s the problem ?
look , i @-@ i &apos;m--i &apos;m not on call tonight .
i &apos;ll--i &apos;ll try to stop by tomorrow .
that &apos;s right , buster . you &apos;re not going anywhere tonight .
mmm . no kidding .
katherine can fix her own leak .
that was katherine ?
you goota get over there right now .
look , i know we &apos;ve gotta be friends with her ,
but not at 11 : 00 . and not when you &apos;re wearing this .
okay , she could sue us .
oh , she &apos;s not gonna sue us over this .
it &apos;s not like our dog peed on her flowers . i shot her .
so call her back and tell her you &apos;ll be right over .
fine .
how long will it take anyway ?
i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s a leak in her master bath .
in the bedroom ?
hello , mike .
and susan . what are you doing here ?
i came to assist my husband ,
get the job done in half the time .
hey , um , where &apos;s your sling ?
oh ! my shoulder &apos;s feeling much better . thank you .
that &apos;s great ! so it doesn &apos;t hurt if i do this ?
hey , why don &apos;t we take a look at this leaky faucet ?
uh , uh , no .
actually , it &apos;s the , um , garbage disposal in the kitchen .
but i thought you said it was in the master bath .
mike , seriously ,
why would a garbage disposal be in the master bath ?
come on . this way .
it &apos;s just making this awful sound .
well , they &apos;re supposed to make an awful sound .
what are you doing up here ?
i knew i never should &apos;ve trusted you .
you just wanted mike over here to try to seduce him .
really , susan .
you have the most suspicious mind .
oh , please . look at this place .
even i &apos;m getting turned on .
so i lit a few candles and sprinkled some rose petals .
i do that every night .
really ? mm .
do you also drink an entire bottle of champagne ?
maybe i have a little problem , okay ?
no , you have a big problem , katherine . mike !
there &apos;s no reason to bring him into this .
oh , well , you say that you do this every night ,
and he used to spend a lot of nights here .
so why don &apos;t we see if it looks familiar to him ? mike !
mike , i need you to come up here ! mike !
come up here right now !
stop ! stop ! stop ! that &apos;s evidence !
leave me alone !
oh , my god . a bubble bath ? !
this is now a bad jackie collins novel .
i want you out of my house .
katherine , you need help .
what you &apos;re doing here ... it &apos;s sick !
you don &apos;t actually think that rose petals and champagne
are gonna work on mike . he loves me !
don &apos;t push me , susan . i &apos;ll sue you !
oh , you know what ? go ahead . sue me !
and while you &apos;re at it ,
get me for assault with a strawberry , too .
uhh ! just ...
you bitch ! aah !
crazy ! aah !
f.y.i. , we hate her again .
mahoney called me and told me that you ...
know about the cheating ?
yeah . i do .
what i don &apos;t know is what the hell &apos;s the matter with you .
why would you do something that stupid ?
because it is a required course that i will never use ,
and ...
i &apos;m failing it .
you &apos;re failing ?
we can &apos;t afford to have you fail .
i know . that &apos;s why i did this ,
so that i could focus all of my attention
on my core classes .
are ... are you failing those , too ?
no ...
but it &apos;s touch @-@ and @-@ go .
my advisor warned me that learning a language at my age
would be difficult ,
and mandarin is one of the hardest .
i study and i study , but i @-@ i &apos;m always behind .
lynette , you gotta understand , i am drowning here .
i don &apos;t care .
what ?
you &apos;re having trouble in school ? talk to me .
talk to your professors . hire a tutor .
what you don &apos;t do is cheat .
come on , lynette . it ... it is statistics .
i &apos;m never gonna use it .
it &apos;s the principle of the thing , tom !
what if the kids found out ?
what kind of example are you setting for them ?
the same one you &apos;re setting .
when gabrielle asked you if you were gaining weight ,
didn &apos;t you lie ?
oh , clearly that &apos;s different .
why ?
because of the consequences .
you could get kicked out of school .
and you could lose one of your best friends .
i &apos;m going to tell gaby the truth ...
eventually .
and when you do , she &apos;ll tell carlos .
and when he finds out
that his new vice president lied to him , he may fire you .
some more about consequences ?
i think the way you &apos;re trying to rationalize your behavior
is pathetic .
we are two middle @-@ aged people , lynette .
we both know the value of principles .
we also know something that we &apos;ve never told the kids ...
that there are , sadly , some times in life
when you need to break the rules in order to survive .
i cheated on a test .
you don &apos;t want to pat me on the back ? fine .
but don &apos;t act like you are better than me ,
&apos;cause you &apos;re not .
&quot; okay , &quot; said skippy .
&quot; i &apos;ll meet you down at red creek after school . &quot;
this is boring . can i watch tv ?
juanita , while you &apos;re here with me ,
it &apos;s the same as if you were at school .
we just finished gym class . now it &apos;s time for reading .
ironing isn &apos;t gym class .
hey , who &apos;s the teacher here , huh ?
read !
you read .
juanita !
come on .
let &apos;s just finish this chapter .
don &apos;t even think about it .
i &apos;m warning you . i am not playing .
juanita , so help me god ...
pick it up !
no .
pick it up or end up on the floor next to it .
thank you . that &apos;s much better .
hello ? so what did we learn today ?
pick up the book ! pick it up !
no ! no !
gaby , what the hell is going on ? !
it &apos;s called homeschooling !
pick ... up ... the ... book !
i did what you asked , karl .
i went home and thought about your proposal .
and ? no , wait . not yet . do i need to brace myself ?
i &apos;m not gonna say no .
really ?
or yes . what &apos;s the point
when i already have a husband i can &apos;t seem to shake ?
so for now , you might wanna focus
on getting me a divorce .
and if i do that , you &apos;ll marry me ?
no , not you , but i am interested in this other karl--
the one you say you &apos;re planning to become .
yeah , if you marry me .
well , i &apos;m afraid
he &apos;s gonna have to make an appearance sooner than that .
i think i can arrange a meeting .
oh ! that &apos;s another thing . no sex for at least a month .
a month ?
you are too adept at using it to cloud my judgment .
i wanna see you through eyes that are clear ,
not rolling back in my head .
so i have to be a good boy and no sex .
it &apos;s like we &apos;re married already .
karl , if we go public with this , let alone marry ,
there will be serious consequences .
susan may never speak to me again ,
and god only knows what orson will do .
i will not even contemplate paying that price
until i &apos;m sure you &apos;re damn well worth it .
and if you can prove that you are ...
then you can give this to me again .
and next time , it &apos;ll mean something .
well , did you talk with her ? is she ready to apologize ?
mm , not quite .
she heard what you said to the principal ,
and she is blaming you
for her not being allowed to go back to school .
so you defended me , right ?
well , that was a little tough ,
what with her being right and you being wrong .
what do you mean wrong ? i did what i did for her .
really ?
you don &apos;t think that maybe a teeny bit of that
was in response to you being criticized as a mom ?
no !
well , maybe &quot; the horse you rode in on &quot; part ,
but the original sentiment was all
in defense of our daughter .
where does she get off being mad at me ?
gaby , she can &apos;t go to school and be with her friends .
she can &apos;t have people over because a chimp
mauled a clown at her birthday party .
she has every right to be mad .
you ... not so much .
ma ? it &apos;s me .
i know . it &apos;s been a long time . i &apos;m sorry .
no , you know i can &apos;t tell you that .
just ... know that we &apos;re safe , okay ?
oh , ma , please , don &apos;t cry .
we only have a few minutes to talk , okay ?
he &apos;s good .
he just turned 19 .
i know . can you believe it ?
yeah , i wish we could , too . uh , it &apos;s just too risky .
but , you know , maybe one of these days ...
ma , i gotta go .
i @-@ i @-@ i &apos;ll talk to you soon . rimanga bene , okay ?
hey ya , katherine . what you got there ?
i thought you said your mother was dead .
oh , yeah . that was my mother @-@ in @-@ law .
nick &apos;s mom .
you call her &quot; ma &quot; ?
we &apos;re close .
i didn &apos;t hear you come in .
the front door was open. here .
hey , is that one of those prepaid phones ?
oh , yeah. when nick and i went on vacation ,
we bought this to call home .
and then we had some minutes left over ,
so i figured i &apos;d use &apos; em up .
what &apos;s on your mind , katherine ?
well , i wanted to drop off the cake as promised
and tell you last night , susan and i had a big fight .
she threw me into the bathtub .
really ?
first she shoots me , now she tries to drown me .
i &apos;m going to the police ,
so i &apos;m gonna need that gun for evidence .
what gun ?
the one she shot me with .
the one danny gave julie .
listen , katherine , i really don &apos;t think it &apos;s a good idea
gettin &apos; the police involved .
just stick to your plan .
i hate that she can get away with this .
hey . nick &apos;s not italian , is he ?
no. why ?
&apos;cause you were talking to his mother in italian .
oh , she likes it. makes her feel sophisticated .
i have a doctor &apos;s appointment in 40 minutes .
i really should get dressed .
but thank you for the cake .
what &apos;s that , sweetie , your homework ?
it &apos;s all homework now , isn &apos;t it ?
look , juanita ,
you know , when i was young , i used to get picked on
because i was the littlest kid in my class ,
and i couldn &apos;t defend myself from the bullies .
and then i discovered a part of me that was big--
my mouth .
and i &apos;ve been fighting back with it ever since .
so when mrs.peterson said those mean things ,
i had to defend you .
why ? i said a bad word .
if you just let her punish me ,
this would all be over .
believe me , leaving that school
is gonna wind up being a good thing .
mrs.peterson is a bully .
i like mrs.peterson.
okay . i was wrong , and i &apos;m sorry you &apos;re upset .
you still think i &apos;m a good mom , right ?
honey ?
can we just read ?
i &apos;m telling you , katherine cannot be trusted .
the way she talks about stealing mike back from you ?
she has completely lost it .
believe me , i know . mike and i have a new rule .
we &apos;re going to pretend that katherine doesn &apos;t exist .
you think that &apos;s gonna be enough ?
you need to get her off the street .
katherine hates you ,
and i &apos;m not talkin &apos; &quot; dirty looks in the supermarket &quot; hate .
that woman is dangerous .
dangerous how ?
okay . i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m even saying this .
but do you know where katherine was
the night that julie was attacked ?
no. that &apos;s crazy. um ...
why would katherine want to hurt julie ?
you had just married the man that she loved .
it was dark .
a woman walked out of your house ...
maybe she didn &apos;t think it was julie .
there are so many rules in this world .
that &apos;s why we must start learning them
while we are still children .
we are told very clearly ...
&quot; don &apos;t say bad words . &quot;
&quot; you &apos;re not allowed to cheat on tests . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not nice to lie to your friends . &quot;
&quot; you shouldn &apos;t covet a man who isn &apos;t yours . &quot;
&quot; and you shouldn &apos;t betray a man who is . &quot;
so we grow up ,
and still we break the rules ...
completely forgetting that if someone catches us ,
we will be punished .
hi there .
yes , good afternoon , sir .
uh , i was hoping to replace the camel brooch
my wife purchased here
i &apos;d like to surprise her
a brooch ? hmm , we don &apos;t have anything like that here .
you must be mistaken .
my wife was quite specific about where she purchased it .
sorry , we sell furniture
she must &apos;ve gotten it somewhere else
excuse me
