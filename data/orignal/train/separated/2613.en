No!
We can't leave him alive.
Please go. I'll finish it.
This is between us.
Do it quickly. I'll be waiting outside.
Hey! What happened to you?
I went out front, and you were gone.
There were police. Is it done?
Yes. He's dead.
Call Ellie.
Hello?
Hey, it's me.
It's about Tom. It's urgent.
I could lose my license for this, go to jail.
You owe me.
Why aren't we at a hospital? He could die!
He cannot die.
I'm gonna need supplies, proper tools.
Steven, hey. It's me. Uh, listen, uh...your boat.
Is it still sitting empty or did you find a buyer?
He's lost too much blood.
You're a Fed.
And he is responsible for Meera's death.
You were her C.I., and you told me
that if I found the man responsible --
I thought you were gonna arrest him.
I will. I just need you to babysit for a little while
until I get some info.
Let's get this straight.
I did not save you because I care.
I saved you because you have intel on Berlin.
I want a name.
Oh, you bitch.
Oh, I don't know, Tom.
From where I'm sitting, you look like the bitch to me.
Why you? Have you spied on others?
Is this what you do?
Yes. No. I don't remember.
I want a name. What bank?
Monarch Douglas in Warsaw.
It's where Berlin keeps his money.
What about accounts, names of shell companies?
Did you murder Jolene Parker?
What do you know about Reddington?
I don't know.
What do you know about Reddington?
I told you I don't know!
What do you know about Reddington?!
Stop asking me! I don't know!
When is this all over, when you are convinced
that I have nothing left to offer, what then?
I asked you a question. Gina Zanetakos.
Because you know when this is over,
you're gonna have to kill me, right?
How often did you communicate with Berlin, his associates?
Tell me about the guests at our wedding.
If you want Ellie to look at that infection,
you're gonna have to answer my question.
I need a doctor!
I need a name!
What about the adoption?
We were married.
Isn't that what married people do?
You know, all this time,
you never asked me if I ever really loved you.
Because I know the answer.
I don't think you do.
You told me if I gave you Berlin that you would let me go.
But I knew the second that you brought me down here
that you had no intention of letting me leave.
So here's the deal, Liz.
You're gonna do whatever you're gonna do.
You always have.
Just do me one favor.
Look me in the eyes when you do it.
Your daughter told me your name is Milos Kirchhoff.
All these years, Mr. Kirchhoff,
you've believed with the blackest of hearts
that I murdered your daughter.
And yet here she is.
The story was wrong, Milos.
Please enlighten me.
What were you told and who did the telling?
It was in '91.
The Soviet Union was falling apart.
A small group of us --
members of the Politburo, the military,
KGB, Stasi --
had a plan to push back the progressives,
to stem the tide.
We were meeting and discussing strategy when a...
bomb...
The Kursk Bombing.
15 men were killed
and with them, our resistance.
Rumors began that the Americans were involved.
One name emerged.
Yours.
You came after my daughter.
You exposed her as a dissident.
She went to jail.
After that, my loyalty was questioned.
I was exiled to the Gulag,
where, one by one,
her bones were sent to me.
You fled.
You must have had help. Who?
There was a man.
He said he could protect me from...
from you.
What was his name?
I never met him. I don't know.
His people -- they called him "The Decembrist."
Please.
That's all I know.
You killed my friends.
You destroyed my life once. Isn't that enough?
At some point, I may call, ask for your assistance.
About what?
The Decembrist.
We can't let him walk out of here.
We agreed when this was over, I'd arrest him.
That was four months ago.
If you turn him now, you're gonna go to jail.
We both will.
I am not a murderer.
Neither am I.
Look, you don't have to be the one to do it.
There are people.
But he can't walk out of here alive.
Close that door. Keep him quiet.
Easy! Harbor master.
All right.
I'm gonna need to see some kind of I.D.
Put the gun down.
Put the gun down!
We...got a call --
reports that someone's been trespassing.
Yeah. That's why I'm here.
FBI. We're searching for two fugitives
escaped from Cumberland last night.
I cleared the boat,
but they're said to be in the area and armed.
My office wasn't contacted.
Bureau would have reached out,
but Homeland's running point.
Go figure. If you do see anything...
Be careful.
Yeah, you, too.
Dembe. Where is he?
You're working with Berlin?
I need to talk to you
about a bombing in the Soviet Union --
Kursk, 1991.
Fella won't talk!
Keep pushing him.
I'm telling you!
He's more scared of talking than he is of dying!
Keep pushing.
I'm gonna need lunch!
Tuna on rye! Coleslaw if they have it!
What the hell is going on?!
We're shaking a few trees.
There's been a development.
It seems Berlin is merely a pawn
who's been tragically manipulated.
Manipulated by who?
That's what Brimley's trying to ascertain.
Berlin killed Meera, he put Tom in my life,
and every time you have a chance to stop him, you let him go.
Berlin will be held accountable for his actions
after I acquire the name of the man who set him against me,
a man they call the Decembrist.
If you want to find the one ultimately responsible
for gutting Harold Cooper and killing Meera Malik,
I suggest you help me find him.
The man we're looking for is known as the Decembrist.
His acts are said to have contributed
to the end of communism in Eastern Europe.
How is he connected to Berlin?
He tried to assassinate him during a meeting in Kursk
and faked his daughter's death.
Berlin's been hunting Reddington, hunting us,
and now Reddington wants to help Berlin get revenge?
Kursk -- that bombing --
the men who were killed that day
were leaders of the Soviet Old Guard.
You really think we should be helping these two settle scores?
Our goal is to take down Berlin.
If that means solving a terrorism case along the way,
I'm fine with that.
I'll contact the FSB.
They won't help.
The bombing was considered an act of patriotism.
That's why they never pursued it.
Pull the Russian reports, the crime-lab data.
I want our own analysis.
They have the bomber's DNA?
Yes. The Russian crime lab
reported finding epithelial cells
on the lip of a coffee tin found in the debris.
How do you know it was the bomber's DNA?
Didn't anyone else like coffee?
Uh, the reports I.D.'d the explosive device as Semtex --
same explosives a bomber used to down Pan Am 103
by hiding the explosives --
In a coffee tin. Our guy copied that?
They have a name?
Only a DNA profile, which was useless 20 years ago
before they had a database to run it against.
But today...
You found the Decembrist.
Kiryl Morozov.
20 years ago, he was a low-level KGB operative.
And today?
One of the most powerful men in Russia.
Someone there?
Okay.
Oh, thank God.
Please.
Kiryl Morozov
is one of Putin's most trusted advisers.
The man runs the Finance Ministry.
And we have reason to believe he's responsible
for the 1991 bombing in Kursk that left --
12 people dead. In Russia.
The FBI investigates crimes
that happen in America or against Americans.
Reddington won't give us Berlin
until we give him Morozov.
At the very least,
we should go there and question the man.
I'm not sending you to Moscow
to interrogate a high-ranking Russian official
about an act of terror he may or may not have committed
25 years ago.
If Reddington gets to Morozov first, God knows --
Harold, that's an order.
That's it?
You're just gonna stand down on this?
You heard her.
My hands are tied.
But Reddington has anonymous sources.
I'm sure he'll get that name somehow.
Won't he, Agent Keen?
Yes, sir. I'm sure he will.
Tell me you have a name.
I do, but this can't come back on the task force.
Are we clear?
Hold on. I'll be right back.
What? Everything okay?
No, everything's not okay. We got a situation here.
Uh, hey. I'm sorry. I got to go.
Lizzy, what's going on?
The Decembrist --
his real name is Kiryl Morozov.
Something's wrong.
Kiryl Morozov.
I got a name.
So it's done?
No.
What are you proposing?
A trip to Moscow.
I went out for a smoke, and he was here.
What the hell?!
Homeboy had a gun.
Are you out of your mind?!
It was him or me.
He's got blood on him.
What did you do? How are we supposed to --
If he doesn't answer that,
someone is gonna come looking for him.
Okay. Here's what we're gonna do.
We're gonna let him go.
We're gonna move Tom.
Let him go? He's gonna talk.
So let him talk.
He says anything, it's his word against mine.
And he's an informant.
Look, lady. This is obviously official business.
I can look the other way.
You got to kill him. - No! Please! Listen. Listen --
Look, if you let this guy go, he's going to the cops.
When he does, we are all going to jail,
starting with you,
for torture, kidnapping, wrongful imprisonment --
take your pick, sweetheart.
You got to kill him.
No. I can fix this.
I have a storage unit. We'll wait till it gets dark.
We'll keep him here temporarily until we can find ano-- no!
It's better this way. Let him do it.
Get off me! Get your hands off me!
Tom, no!
Tom, stop!
Next one goes in your chest!
Tom, let him go!
I think maybe you should call Mr. Kaplan.
Kiryl Morozov is paranoid and well-protected.
He has no clear weakness for women or drink.
However, like any politician, he does have an unending need
to hide his ill-gotten gains.
The diamonds.
Which he buys and sells
through your broker at Mercury City Tower in Moscow.
There was a friendly
and rather convenient diamond heist this morning.
When Morozov learns the broker has been hit,
he'll insist on a meeting to assess his exposure.
When he does, we'll be there waiting.
Milos, focus.
I've made Morozov millions,
and he's the one who set all this in motion?
Milos, the meeting at Mercury Tower --
When it happens,
it'll happen fast before the M.U.R. arrives.
My people will be ready.
I am retribution.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Kursk.
Milos?
The bombing, my daughter -- all of it brings us here.
I did what I was told.
You're not the Decembrist.
It was the American. It was him.
They gave the order!
What people?
I can't say.
Who is the Decembrist?
Fitch.
His name is Alan Fitch.
Milos, this you cannot do.
Give me one reason.
Because he's mine.
Yours?
He gave the orders, discredited you,
and you want to protect him?
This is not for you to do.
But I will.
Alan Fitch is dead.
Call the florist.
The joint chiefs want another forward base.
That will only happen if we can convince Islamabad.
Which is unlikely.
It will happen
if we tether it to foreign military investment.
Alan?
Sir, will you make the call?
A little early in the day, don't you think, Ray?
I'm still on Moscow time.
Just got back from calling on an old friend of yours --
Kiryl Morozov.
You met with the Russian Finance Minister?
To what end?
To his end, as it turned out.
Drink?
The Finance Minister of Russia is dead.
If a single word -- a whisper of this gets out,
if anyone even suspects we sanctioned it --
I didn't sanction anything.
Damn it, Harold.
Your team discovers Morozov
was behind the Kursk Bombing,
and 18 hours later, he's dead?
Reddington is behind this!
Reddington called an hour ago.
He believes Alan Fitch's life is in danger.
Did Reddington bother to tell you why
Berlin is suddenly interested in killing Alan Fitch?
He believes he's the one who orchestrated the Kursk Bombing.
Are you accusing the Assistant Director of National Intelligence
of being a terrorist?
We need to bring him in.
Alan Fitch is not your concern.
I'll contact the secretary of Homeland Security
and have the situation handled.
Ray, will you listen?
We had an agreement.
Yes.
I don't go after you, you don't come after me.
I know the terms, Ray.
But Berlin predates it.
You ordered the bombing in Kursk.
Then you pinned it on me.
You blamed me for killing his daughter.
Some years ago, a copy of this photo
was left on the corpse of an associate of mine.
Taking it as a warning,
I traced the girl to a man they call the Stewmaker.
He told me a story about the girl.
She was sent to him by a man she'd never met.
She was in trouble, needed to disappear,
so he took her photo, put it in a locket,
and sent it to her father.
All those years spent searching for the man
who supposedly murdered his daughter,
and it was you.
You sat here in this very room
and pretended you had no idea who Berlin was
or why he was coming for me.
He was coming, Alan, because you sent him.
I sent a lot of guys.
You and I were not on the best of terms at the time.
And since you're playing the innocent victim in all this,
let me remind you --
you stole some very damaging information about us
when you disappeared.
You violated our agreement.
No.
I honored it.
I got the others to hold off,
but Milos Kirchhoff, Berlin,
whatever the hell name he's using...
He chewed through the leash.
I couldn't stop him.
Well, now your dog is tracking a new scent -- yours.
And there's nothing I can do about that, Alan.
I have my people looking for him,
but Berlin has gone into the wind.
And he's coming for you.
You have no allies in my group.
Without me to protect you, they'll take you down
and they'll let the chips fall where they may.
So this is as much your problem as it is mine.
Sir, O.D.N.I. has credible intel
that there might be an attempt on your life.
What did they say?
Still waiting to hear.
They want to move you to Fort McNair
to do a full briefing.
Deputy Fitch, Homeland Security.
We need you to come with us.
Guardian's en route. Delivery on schedule.
Our office has notified the university.
Contact the D.C. field office.
Get me an update on any eyewitnesses, satellite footage.
Alan Fitch's abduction must be on Mossad's radar.
Reach out to your people in Tel Aviv.
And you -- talk to him.
Elizabeth, we need to talk. Now.
Tom.
What?
You told me tom is dead. He's not.
Who told you he's alive?
I'm disappointed you haven't felt
that you could trust me enough to tell me this.
Look, okay, I lied.
But I only kept it a secret
because I know you want him dead.
No, you kept it a secret
because you didn't want to admit to yourself
that you still love him,
that even after everything he has done,
after how horribly he treated you,
you still can't let him go.
So...you're playing house.
I've been using him as a source,
and he's been incredibly valuable.
Normally, any intelligence you could gather from Tom Keen
would be yesterday's news.
But Berlin has gone to ground,
and is likely dependent on former assets he used
when your husband was in his employ.
So it seems Tom may be of some value after all.
I need to know everything he can tell you
about Berlin's former safe houses, former contacts.
All that matters is finding Alan Fitch.
This ends now.
I already gave you Berlin.
I told you where to find him.
Yes. And he disappeared.
I did everything I could... from in here.
Forget it. I already told you --
And I told you it's the only way.
Take a look, Liz. This is a problem.
And time is not on your side.
I need information, not advice.
We both know that you are in over your head.
You are not equipped for this, Liz,
because you are not a killer.
It's why I'm still alive
and why you've got a corpse lying there
that you have done nothing with.
And your bodyguard, the one that you shot --
where do you think he is right now?
He's getting a gun, Liz,
so he can come back here and kill me
and then probably kill you, too.
Now, I told you -- there is a way out of this.
I can give you Berlin,
and all you have to do...
is let me go.
Gosh, he's a popular guy.
I bet somebody's gonna miss him.
Berlin.
Orenburg six.
Scorpio.
That function is no longer valid.
Wait, wait, listen.
Tell him Tom Keen wants to talk.
Liz, why would you do this?
I mean, you're risking everything.
To find Berlin.
You're a federal agent harboring a fugitive.
I mean, worse than that -- you're keeping him captive.
500 cops are out there looking for Fitch right now,
and we're gonna find him because of this.
I thought you were dead.
I need you to bring me in.
No.
Listen to me.
I can help you.
Well, time has passed. Plans have changed.
I know you have Fitch.
I know everything they know about you and your operation,
and you're gonna want to hear it,
but I'm not telling you anything until you bring me in.
Whether he leads us to Fitch or not,
I got to take him in.
Are you hearing me?
You had to know when you told me
that this is where it was gonna go.
I -- Liz, I can't be part of this.
He's an informant, like Reddington.
The difference is you're not in love with Reddington.
I got an address.
Where?
Where? What difference does it make where?
What? You're gonna follow his lead
to someplace he says Berlin is hiding?
No. There could be 50 guys waiting.
That's stupid.
Hey, shut up. I wasn't asking you.
You want Berlin or not?
There's no way I'm gonna let you go in there.
This is a setup, an ambush.
What are you, her boyfriend?
What address?
3952 Spalding Street, Apartment 24.
Hey, pal. I'm coming for you.
Good luck with that.
I think we have a problem.
Clear it out. Let's go. Clear out. Clear out.
Looks like we're dealing with a plastic explosive --
C4, approximately 2 kilos.
Sir, the blasting cap's wired to a receiver.
We found our detonator.
This thing can be detonated remotely.
We need to jam the frequencies in case this nut job
tries to set it off and blow us to hell.
Then you're gonna disarm it?
We have a vehicle for controlled detonation.
It should be big enough to accommodate Mr. Fitch and one of my men.
Once he's contained, then we can attempt
to disassemble and disarm the device.
Well, how long is that thing gonna take to get here?
Half-hour minimum,
unless you've got another R.F. resistant armored box that fits two.
Actually, I think it fits four.
We managed to gain access to the internals,
trying to circumvent the keypad.
Here's what we got so far.
The Semtex runs along the circumference of the collar,
as you can see.
encased within that,
approximately 14 inches of solid core wire
connected to a microprocessor
which, among other things, creates a closed circuit.
So if you cut the collar off,
you interrupt the circuit and... bang?
Then how do we disable it?
Cautiously.
We need to chip through the Semtex
to see exactly what's underneath,
make sure there aren't any redundant circuits or backups.
And you can do that without triggering that thing?
We'll find out, won't we?
Look, I know I disobeyed a direct --
You found him. That's all that matters.
Fill me in.
We got played, Keen. I mean, look at it.
Berlin's gone. Tom's free.
He brought us Fitch.
Berlin handed us Fitch on a silver platter
after he had a bomb strapped to his neck.
Look, I've been thinking about what I said in the car, and --
Don't worry about it, Ressler. I'll tell Cooper.
I understand you're responsible for finding Fitch.
About the source...
Yeah?
Does he have information about Berlin?
Yes, we believe he does.
I don't care if your source is confidential
or what promises you've made him.
I want him here, I want him interrogated,
and I want his name.
You must be kidding.
Do I sound like I'm kidding?
It's Reddington.
Her source is Reddington.
Please excuse my intrusion.
I'm curious.
Your father --
I assume he's been trying to reach you.
Has he called?
I thought as much.
Sir, the device has a secondary detonator
built in as a safeguard.
What kind of safeguard?
A timer.
We think it was activated
when the receiver broke radio contact.
How long do you have?
It's unclear.
We can see the timing circuit, but there's no display.
It could be a minute. It could be an hour.
You're not hungry?
It's fine.
Let's get you something else.
Whatever you like.
I can tell them to go.
No. I'm the one who should go. I...
No, no. They make you uncomfortable?
I'm glad you called.
You're scared.
I am, too.
I don't know how to talk to someone...
like you.
I really should go.
No. Please don't.
I know you have your life.
I have no place there. I know.
But I just want you to stay a little longer.
Hello, Milos.
Thank you, my dear.
Passports, tickets, and my eternal gratitude.
The bomb.
I need to know how to stop the bomb.
I don't know.
That's the wrong answer.
I'm telling you I don't...
Think harder.
What's your name, son?
What?
Your name. What -- what is it?
Sir, I need to be as still as possible.
Any movement, the vibrations of your voice...
Do you have a wife, kids?
That's what makes it the hardest --
a wife and kids.
I've been in the intelligence field a long time now.
On my orders, 763 men and women have died
in service to their country.
And there wasn't a grieving wife or mother or husband
I didn't either call or visit personally.
Thank them for their sacrifice.
That's what makes it the hardest --
the families.
You can't disarm it, can you?
Sir, I asked you to be as still as possible.
763.
That's more than enough.
I'm not gonna make it 764.
What's your name?
Mike.
My name's Mike.
Go home, Mike.
You've done everything you can.
Harold, I know you're listening.
Tell Ray I need to see him.
What a long, strange trip it's been, Alan.
Listen to me, Ray.
I don't know how much time we have,
so you need to pay attention.
I've been able to hold everyone off,
convince them that it's in their best interests to let you live.
But people aren't as scared as they once were.
Some aren't so sure you even have it.
Do you have it, Ray?
Do you have the fulcrum?
They're gonna demand proof.
I can't stop this thing, Alan.
I tried.
I can't.
My death will trigger a series of events.
The moderates are already outnumbered.
The closer we get to 2017,
the more radicalized they'll become.
Talk to Mitchum and Hobbs.
They might be persuaded.
Jasper sides with the Chinese --
All right. Listen to me, Ray. This is critical.
I have a safe. Get to it.
The combination --
8-30-44.
Remember that. Say it back.
8-30-44.
8-30-44.
Margaret's birthday.
You've had a wonderful life together, Alan.
51 years last month.
The safe.
The safe.
It's in St. Petersburg
in the wall on the second floor of --
Untie him.
Thank you.
Na zdorov'e.
Na zdorov'e.
I remember the parades from when I was a young boy,
standing by my father,
seeing those trucks that went by
with the rockets and cannons.
Beautiful.
And all those men marching as one,
saluting at me as one.
Our soldiers, our nation.
Yuri Gargarin was the first man in space.
We were so proud.
Your gentleman friend with the earring
said he moved the body.
Mr. Kaplan is with him now.
We're trying to contain the situation.
You should have come to me.
I didn't need to.
Look around you, Lizzy.
We found Fitch because of Tom.
It wasn't worth it --
not if the cost was you,
here in this...
filth.
I couldn't do it.
I told you I could kill Tom,
but...after you left, I just...
♬Look up to the sky and leave this world behind you♬
after all the lies and everything he did to me,
I told myself I was using him,
that I was finally in control.
When you love someone, you have no control.
That's what love is --
being powerless.
I don't know what's wrong with me.
There's nothing wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with you.
♬But can you move and shake♬
♬Are you a dead man or a fake♬
♬Are you a dead man or a fake♬
♬Are you a dead man or a fake♬
Do you have it?
♬See this world around you♬
♬There will be no hesitation♬
♬There will be no hesitation♬
♬but can you move and shake♬
You are never to see her again.
♬Are you a dead man or a fake♬
Yeah. I got it.
I don't think you do.
Look at me.
You are never to see her again.
You know, for what it's worth,
I spent four months on that ship chained up...
and I never told her about us.
Not one word.
