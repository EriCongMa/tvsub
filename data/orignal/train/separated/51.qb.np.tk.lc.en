okay , a couple of things before we get started .
you are a witness appearing before a grand jury
in cook county and not its target .
but you also have the right to have an attorney with you
to answer any questions that you might have .
do you understand that ?
yes .
please state your name for the record .
blake calamar .
that &apos;s c @-@ a @-@ l @-@ a @-@ m @-@ a @-@ r.
have you and i ever met before ?
yes , uh , we have ,
when you searched my apartment and threatened me .
have we kissed and made up ?
not really .
uh , but i intend to tell the truth here , anyway .
because you &apos;ve been granted immunity .
well , i &apos;d tell the truth either way ,
but a little immunity never hurt .
cary ... where are you going with this ?
i &apos;m showing how he has knowledge of criminal activity .
they don &apos;t give a rat &apos;s ass .
get on with it .
where are you employed , mr. calamar ?
until recently ,
i was employed at lockhart / gardner &amp; bond .
and you were brought there by mr. derrick bond ,
is that correct ?
yes .
and he was recently forced out .
by the other partners , uh , diane lockhart
and will gardner .
and you were also
in the employ of someone else while working in chicago .
yes . i did supply ,
and still supply , support for lemond bishop .
and what is mr. bishop &apos;s business ?
well , he has several .
uh ... a string of dry cleaners ,
uh , health clubs ...
isn &apos;t he also the top dealer of illegal drugs in cook county ?
i don &apos;t ... know much about that .
and didn &apos;t you also work
for a time protecting his interests in prostitution ?
i was a part of his security detail .
i just went where he told me .
and you brought his business to lockhart / gardner .
yes . yes , his ... legal business .
let &apos;s turn to the target of this grand jury .
how do you know her ?
kalinda sharma ?
yes .
she &apos;s an investigator at lockhart / gardner .
this is where you were witness to her illegal activities .
yes .
it &apos;s a new day .
you sound sarcastic .
no . that was me being genuine .
bond is gone ; blake is gone ...
so what &apos;s wrong ?
what makes you think anything is wrong ?
ever get the feeling something bad is gonna happen ?
all the time .
it &apos;s a vulnerable time ... we need to make it look
like the loss of bond makes us stronger , not weaker .
we cannot lose a single client .
it &apos;ll become a domino effect .
so meet with all your accounts ...
if there &apos;s a hint of unhappiness , tell us ,
and we &apos;ll fill the room .
all right , let &apos;s do it .
it &apos;s about a law firm with a sphere of influence .
chicago and dc ,
dc and chicago .
no .
you know what it &apos;s about ?
being in the larger conference room .
your business isn &apos;t confined to one city ,
and neither should your law firm be .
what we see for you is , uh ...
mr. bishop thank you for coming on in ,
hearing from us .
no problem .
derrick wanted me to go with him .
i know . i &apos;ll be honest .
we had a disagreement about the direction of the firm ,
and we ... we want to do everything we can to make you happy .
are we happy , dex ?
we &apos;re getting there .
well , good , because we &apos;re here for you .
that &apos;s good to know .
because ...
i do have something ...
unusual ...
... i have to ask of you .
and her .
polling .
look , diane ,
i &apos;m in no danger of leaving you guys .
i never liked bond , so don &apos;t ...
holy ... !
look at the comparison .
uh , d @-@ diane , i gotta go .
no , no , no , no .
we @-@ we just closed within a point of wendy scott @-@ carr .
bye .
we &apos;re gonna win this .
don &apos;t say it , damn it .
go outside and come back in .
nora ! get the dcc on the phone .
they &apos;re here .
they &apos;re here ? who &apos;s here ?
frank landau .
head of the democratic committee ?
and the mountain comes to muhammad .
well , this should be fun .
eli gold .
frank landau .
you &apos;ve met matt becker .
so , you did it ... you got rid of childs .
well , childs dropped out for family reasons .
we &apos;ll support you . we &apos;ll climb on board ;
but we need a couple of guarantees first , from you and peter .
we have a couple of people on childs &apos; staff ,
we need to make sure they stay .
wh @-@ what are you doing ?
nothing . go on .
you &apos;re not outsiders anymore , so ...
eli , what are you doing ?
i &apos;m lowering my pants .
why ?
to make it easier for you to kiss my ass .
you think i &apos;ll get a warmer welcome from wendy ?
i &apos;m sure you will ,
up until the day they get elected .
what do you want ?
i &apos;ll think about it and give you a call .
just to warn you , mr. bishop ,
we need to be a bit cautious in the way we discuss
your more street @-@ level holdings .
my wife is divorcing me .
i &apos;m so sorry .
thank you .
she had a divorce lawyer call .
i &apos;m embarrassed to say ...
i was surprised .
i love my wife .
i love my kids .
but my business sometimes takes me away from home .
of course .
i hope we find some way to work this out .
it &apos;s better to be careful .
yes .
and given the ...
difficulties of my ...
business ...
a divorce may prove problematic .
well , we are a full @-@ service firm , sir .
we &apos;re in your corner .
thank you .
well , even drug dealers get divorced , too .
alicia , you work with david lee on this .
got it .
so , politics is the politics ,
but the business of this office still continues .
and don &apos;t worry ,
all @-@ all salary and job commitments will be honored .
for the lucky few .
you care to share that , geneva , with everybody ?
sure . the new state &apos;s attorney cleans house ... you know that .
no . i mean , whoever wins , the budget crisis is so extreme ,
they can &apos;t start over .
and everybody in this room
has a commitment from this office , either way .
you &apos;re a survivor , aren &apos;t you , geneva ?
are you telling me that none of those sick days from last month
were spent interviewing ?
go back to work , people .
you &apos;re wrong about one thing .
not everybody in this room has a commitment .
well , your salary bump is in the works .
it &apos;s moving slowly .
well , let &apos;s get it moving fast .
i want friends in this office , cary .
i &apos;m not gonna screw you over .
just don &apos;t screw me over .
his businesses aren &apos;t doing well .
bishop ... his business ... it &apos;s been hurt by the economy .
yeah , his legal business .
oh , it &apos;s all right .
i &apos;m trying to drink less .
since when ?
my daughter ... she thinks i drink too much .
you know what your problem is ?
i don &apos;t drink enough ?
you didn &apos;t get your tubes tied .
here .
i saw you get this upstairs ... what is it ?
go ahead .
oh , my god .
yep . it &apos;s my grand jury subpoena .
kalinda , why are you being so calm ?
i &apos;m not .
it &apos;s just it &apos;s been a long time coming .
what has ?
state &apos;s attorney thinks too many people leak to me .
but ... kalinda , this is for wednesday .
you need to call a lawyer .
yeah , i did .
who ?
you .
hey . jimmy patrick back with you .
jesus was black .
there goes another sunday school lesson down the drain .
all those preachers saying jesus was as white as billy graham ...
nope . sorry .
you see this skin ? he was darker than me .
middle @-@ eastern .
that &apos;s right , the son of god
looked like chris rock , not lance armstrong .
what this office needs is a breath of fresh air ,
and that &apos;s why i support wendy scott @-@ carr for state &apos;s attorney .
you &apos;re watching the live coverage ...
you need to change your campaign strategy , eli .
you know it .
we were never gonna get him anyway .
doesn &apos;t matter . look at the polling .
you &apos;re not counting the youth vote .
i am counting the youth votes .
wendy &apos;s got the black vote and the liberal whites .
you need blue @-@ collar whites .
oh , you mean the racist whites ?
your politics is getting in the way of your polling .
you need blue @-@ collar whites , soccer moms ,
you need to start pushing a new message :
&quot; bring back the old chicago . &quot;
why not &quot; save our neighborhoods &quot; ?
sure .
although i know you think that &apos;s ... too obvious and unhip .
and racist .
they &apos;re votes .
you don &apos;t cater to them , they sit this one out ,
and you lose by one point .
read the projections .
go ahead . you need to take the black faces off the web site .
put peter on the dais with white suburbanites ,
and stop doing photo ops south of 47th .
so , what are you going to do , eli ?
look at me .
i made a mistake .
i said i &apos;m sorry .
that doesn &apos;t change anything .
you slept with her .
she didn &apos;t mean anything .
i &apos;m in love with you .
you don &apos;t cheat on the person you &apos;re in love with .
i said it won &apos;t happen again .
it will happen again .
because the easiest thing in the world is for you to say
it won &apos;t happen again .
i &apos;ll go to counseling .
let &apos;s just ask these lawyers to leave .
no . let &apos;s start .
we suggest mediation ...
one veto apiece for mediators .
at alternating sites ?
you mean , your mother &apos;s living room ?
we rent space from a law firm in the loop .
how nice for you . can i have one of your cards ?
i imagine you &apos;re too new to be in the phone book .
thank you .
what do you want , mr. bishop ?
i want her not to leave me .
the best way to put out a fire is to starve it of oxygen .
in a divorce , oxygen is money .
if she doesn &apos;t get your money , she won &apos;t leave .
whatever you need to do .
i guess it &apos;s sweet : a drug kingpin in love .
she really had a hard time finding a lawyer .
this guy &apos;s barely out of law school .
it &apos;s not the safest thing for him to do ,
helping her divorce bishop .
where &apos;s kalinda ? i thought she was checking into his finances .
his dry cleaners , health clubs , gas stations ...
they &apos;re all on the verge of chapter 11 .
he &apos;s propping them up with his other income .
good . let her try to go after his drug trade .
that &apos;s a battle i am prepared to win .
no matter what , you plead the fifth .
kalinda , the only way that this works
and the only reason i agreed to be your lawyer
was you do as i say .
they get you talking , they win .
you defend yourself , they win .
okay .
the questions are devised to make you look bad ,
so no matter , you say ... ?
i refuse to answer on the grounds it may incriminate me .
good .
now , a chicago grand jury will indict a ham sandwich .
don &apos;t say a thing ; don &apos;t make their job easier .
kalinda ... what &apos;s going on ?
i can &apos;t help you unless i know .
it &apos;s about blake .
dr. booth from last year .
the psychologist from our pharmaceutical win ?
yeah .
blake broke into his office and beat him up .
that &apos;s how we won .
he tried to set me up by leaving my fingerprints on a glass .
why is blake doing this ?
he &apos;s not a very good person .
i don &apos;t want to pry , but you have to trust me .
i do trust you .
more than usual .
um , i &apos;m not , um ...
it &apos;s not in my nature to talk , alicia .
i &apos;m not hiding anything .
can you keep me out of jail ?
i &apos;m home !
oh , pastor isaiah .
are you waiting for my dad ?
yes .
i &apos;m grace .
i know . hello .
do you think jesus was black ?
do i ?
yeah .
he was dark @-@ skinned , being a middle @-@ eastern jew .
doesn &apos;t it make you mad when people make him white ?
i think people always want to see jesus as looking like them .
but isn &apos;t that bad ?
sometimes . sometimes not .
do you believe in global warming ?
yes . i do .
do you ?
yeah , and what about politics ?
are you a democrat ?
i try not to answer that question .
yeah , but you &apos;re an african @-@ american ,
so it makes sense to be a democrat .
i think a lot of things that make sense aren &apos;t always true .
i am ending this call .
pastor isaiah , i &apos;m so sorry .
peter asked me to tell you that he can &apos;t make it today .
ah .
hi .
hi .
we were just talking .
how nice .
do you think jesus was black ?
we thought he &apos;s black , or dark @-@ skinned .
he was a middle @-@ eastern jew , so it makes sense .
sure . he must have been something , right ?
could you , um , excuse us for a moment , please , grace ?
i like talking to you .
i like talking to you .
peter asked me to say that ,
for the last few weeks of the campaign ,
i &apos;ll need him full @-@ time , so could he have a rain check on
your spiritual guidance days ?
is that what peter wants ?
it &apos;s just for the last few weeks of the campaign .
oh , and the prayer breakfast .
my mistake . we have a scheduling conflict .
peter &apos;s making a speech at his son &apos;s school .
you understand .
i think i do .
it &apos;s just until the election .
after that , the schedule starts to loosen up .
i &apos;m sure it will .
good @-@ bye , pastor !
good @-@ bye , grace .
welcome to mediation , everybody .
i &apos;m your mutually agreed upon mediator .
my name is frederick medkiff . please call me fred .
and i want to assure both sides that i &apos;m here to help you reach
a yes .
you &apos;re kidding me .
this is crazy .
you expect us to believe mr. bishop is almost broke ?
you can believe what you want , but he is actually almost broke .
before we move to specifics , let &apos;s share a few thoughts
on what we want to get .
i helped you build up that business , lemond .
i put my life on hold so you could build it .
and what business would that be , ma &apos;am ?
oh , come on .
if she goes to jail for it , he goes to jail , too .
uh , i &apos;m sorry . was that a threat ?
you want a threat ? here &apos;s a threat .
wait , wait , wait . did he just say what i think he just said ?
you can go to hell , and this whole stupid ...
and is he really threatening me with jail time ?
i see no need for any harsh language here at all .
now , it &apos;s not wrong to express feelings ,
but let &apos;s all take a breath .
you owe me half .
half of what ? half of chapter 11 ?
we &apos;d like to call a witness .
it &apos;s our right .
i work for the anti @-@ gang division
of the illinois office of the federal bureau of investigation .
come on . now you &apos;re kidding .
and you &apos;ve been following mr. bishop &apos;s
activities for how long now ?
five years .
mr. bishop .
agent hemings .
can you give us a recent valuation
of mr. bishop &apos;s illegal drug activity ?
acknowledging that it &apos;s merely the deepest conjecture
from a man who would arrest my client if he had any proof .
we have no subpoena power here , mr. lee .
no court reporter , no transcripts .
this is purely a mediation .
this input will help me determine a fair settlement .
our last estimate , we put the valuation
of mr. bishop &apos;s drug trade at $ 88 million .
oh , come on . now you &apos;re dreaming .
the fbi doesn &apos;t dream , mr. lee .
oh , really ?
what were you doing on september 11 ?
that was not us . that was the cia .
oh , it was the cia , was it ?
yeah , the cia . ignored incredible intel .
you know , it &apos;s in the history books .
have you read the 911 report ?
and you &apos;ve kept the books for how long , mr. roja ?
uh , about three years .
uh ... but i wouldn &apos;t call them exactly books , you know .
i @-@ i keep count .
and is $ 88 million a correct valuation ?
i wish ! i mean , that ...
that may be what the fbi sees coming in ,
but there &apos;s breakage .
you know , how much product and cash just walks out of the door .
we have payments that we have to make regularly .
never mind .
and the economy ?
yeah , you would think this economy would be good for us ,
but a lot of our high @-@ end customers are pulling back
or finding different avenues .
i mean , there &apos;s still some street level ,
but then there &apos;s the trickle @-@ down effect .
what do you estimate then ?
uh , i don &apos;t know .
uh ... three million a year gross .
oh , come on .
you calling me a liar ?
dexter , you don &apos;t really believe ...
you know , kat , seriously ...
please !
shut up !
no . i &apos;m gonna call you on your bluff .
mrs. bishop is not walking away with one million dollars .
well , then , let &apos;s go to court .
they both end up in prison .
your client doesn &apos;t want that .
my client doesn &apos;t want mrs. bishop to have a cent .
he &apos;s in love , and people in love do desperate things .
oh , is that a threat ?
it &apos;s a fact .
you don &apos;t realize .
mrs. bishop has the kids ,
and she doesn &apos;t have to go to court to keep him from the kids .
that &apos;s what i call a threat .
yeah . tell mr. bishop to come up with a number .
a million bucks on the table ,
and she threatens him with the kids .
find out why she &apos;s going scorched earth .
okay .
what was that about ?
another case .
are you comfortable ?
i am .
i see you have availed yourself of an attorney , miss sharma .
i would warn her , per illinois statute ,
you may consult with her ,
but she may not speak at these proceedings .
is that understood ?
it is .
how long have you worked at lockhhart / gardner ?
i refuse to answer on the grounds that it may incriminate me .
i see . that &apos;s how we &apos;re gonna handle this ?
as is miss sharma &apos;s right .
we ask that the state &apos;s attorney accept
a blanket statement of fifth amendment protection .
let me ask that mrs. florrick remain silent .
did you beat the psychologist ... dr. booth ?
i refuse to answer on the grounds that it may incriminate me .
were you ordered by your superior , mr. will gardner ,
to beat dr. booth ?
i refuse to answer on the grounds that it may incriminate me .
were you ordered by your superior , diane lockhart ,
to beat dr. booth ?
i refuse to answer on the grounds that it may incriminate me .
but it makes sense
that you would only act at the behest of your superiors .
i refuse to answer on the grounds that it may incriminate me .
would you care to share that note
with the rest of us , miss sharma ?
it &apos;s attorney @-@ client work product ,
so we politely decline .
is there a systematic plan
at lockhart / gardner to break the law when pursuing cases ?
i refuse to answer on the grounds that it may incriminate me .
he can &apos;t be coming after us .
childs is a lame duck .
that &apos;s exactly when he would be coming after us .
he doesn &apos;t have to deal with the political heat .
oh , could still be about me .
overcharging at the grand jury .
no . childs is communicating through us to you two .
that &apos;s the only reason he hauled kalinda in ...
so we &apos;d hear their questions .
so , what &apos;s the next step ?
grand jury is questioning their star witness again .
blake .
blake .
what is this ?
maybe you should talk to him .
blake .
maybe you should .
tell me about your dad . anything that comes to mind .
my dad &apos;s my best friend .
oh .
he takes me to school .
we play baseball .
and he showed me how to make sloppy joes .
the secret &apos;s brown sugar .
brown sugar . sounds delicious .
so , dads can be fun , huh ?
you feel like you can count on your dad ?
uh @-@ huh . one time , i ate a peanut .
i was in the hospital for three days .
my dad slept in my room .
what happened the last time you had a birthday ...
what &apos;d you do ?
for my birthday , mom and dad , they got a ice cream truck ,
and i could have as much as i wanted .
dylan , what is your dad &apos;s job ?
he &apos;s a businessman .
have you ever seen your dad on tv ?
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s relevant .
it is if you &apos;re making a custody determination .
dylan , what did you see on tv ?
i saw this man .
he said my dad did bad things .
but my dad , he said it was a mistake .
he said not to watch .
what else did the man say about your dad ?
enough .
enough .
mr. bishop , your lawyers will have their chance .
no .
dylan ...
you don &apos;t have to answer any more questions .
was i bad ?
no . no , you could never be bad .
i &apos;ll talk to mommy .
$ 21 million and joint custody .
you don &apos;t want me to take that back to him .
then let &apos;s bring his kid back in for questioning again .
how can she do that ?
do what ?
put her son up there like that .
she doesn &apos;t want to .
that &apos;s why she has me .
tell him $ 21 million
and he &apos;ll have joint custody .
what &apos;s going on ? you find out anything ?
she &apos;s having an affair .
with who , the lawyer ?
i don &apos;t know .
she has a meeting arranged this weekend
at a rolling crest suites in lake forest ... room 333 .
that would explain why he &apos;s fighting so hard .
bishop doesn &apos;t know yet , does he ?
i don &apos;t think so .
but it &apos;s only a matter of time .
everything all right ?
i think i &apos;ve just been cured of love .
oh , no , it &apos;s not her .
lawyers have a way of making things ... ugly .
if there &apos;s one thing i &apos;ve learned in my business :
lawyers don &apos;t act on their own .
wait !
one second !
have you met zach &apos;s girlfriend ?
yeah , why ?
she &apos;s black .
becca ?
no . nisa .
who &apos;s nisa ?
zach &apos;s girlfriend .
since when ?
november .
she &apos;s really sweet .
i think her dad &apos;s from , like , somalia or something .
but her mom lives here .
zach &apos;s gonna bring her to dad &apos;s speech at school .
he really wants dad to meet her .
and ...
i met this really nice guy on line .
jimmy patrick . he &apos;s black , too .
okay , you &apos;re making this up now .
no , i &apos;m not .
the florrick children just really love black people .
you kids are evil !
mr. gardner .
why are you doing this ?
what ?
grand jury .
what do you want ?
why do you think i want anything ?
look , i &apos;ve been granted immunity .
i gotta tell the truth .
kalinda didn &apos;t hurt that doctor .
you know we didn &apos;t order anything .
that &apos;s not really true .
you told me to go kneecap him .
i &apos;m guessing you told kalinda the same thing .
that &apos;s what you &apos;re hanging your hat on , huh ?
an inept metaphor ?
i don &apos;t work in metaphors .
it &apos;s kind of like at your old firm ...
i was told to cover up your theft .
okay , now you &apos;re getting in dangerous territory .
i remember using a lot of metaphors back then .
i was your &quot; life preserver . &quot;
i was your , uh , &quot; ace in the hole . &quot;
we agree .
i paid my debt .
i &apos;ve been subpoenaed .
i gotta answer honestly .
but you didn &apos;t want the kids involved in the campaign .
and they &apos;re not .
um , peter is speaking at zach &apos;s school .
that &apos;s right .
i don &apos;t think you quite realize
how zach could be involved in this story .
you said you didn &apos;t want them involved ,
and i am trying to honor that .
okay .
thank you .
how are you doing ?
i hear it &apos;s a new day here .
it is .
and peter , too .
he &apos;s winning .
it &apos;ll still be close ; it &apos;s chicago .
do you know where you &apos;ll live ?
where i &apos;ll ... ?
after the election .
you &apos;ll be able to afford more .
move out of the apartment
and get back to where you were before .
i just got a call .
the grand jury ?
no . cary .
that &apos;s our deal .
you do know that i &apos;m an attorney with lockhart / gardner .
we do know that .
it &apos;s a deal we &apos;d advise kalinda to take .
we have a witness who can nail kalinda
for putting dr. booth into a coma .
two years minimum . on the other hand ,
you testify against lockhart / gardner ,
we &apos;ll grant you full immunity .
you lost . get over it .
mrs. florrick is incorrect in thinking
this is about her husband &apos;s campaign .
i &apos;ve not made it about her husband &apos;s campaign .
in fact ... i have been meticulous
in keeping the two separate .
kalinda sharma , on the other hand ,
has a decision to make .
turn evidence against the law firm
or get indicted and serve two years .
hi , mrs. florrick .
hi , nisa . how &apos;s everything at school ?
good .
my parents aren &apos;t happy about the shorter fridays .
nobody is .
they &apos;re starting a petition , if you want to sign .
sure .
dad &apos;s coming to campus monday . are you coming ?
i can &apos;t . i have to work .
but , zach , i need to talk to you for a minute .
the press may want to ask you a few questions on campus .
i don &apos;t want to get you involved ,
so i &apos;ll ask dad not to point you out either , okay ?
okay . nobody will care , though .
i know , but i &apos;ll care .
i haven &apos;t wanted you guys involved in this .
eli asked you to talk to him , didn &apos;t he ?
no one &apos;s talking to you .
hey , but this is not about zach .
it &apos;s about his girlfriend .
grace ...
eli doesn &apos;t want anybody involved who &apos;s black .
i told him that zach has an african @-@ american girlfriend .
that &apos;s why he talked to you , right ?
this is about nisa ?
no ... i don &apos;t know .
that is ... so wrong .
you should tell eli off .
okay , both of you just calm down .
what can i tell nisa ?
nisa , can you stay for dinner ?
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;ll call my mom .
okay .
what &apos;s up ?
eli , we need to talk . drop by my office tomorrow .
the house in lincoln park ,
the summer home in boca raton ,
titled in her name ;
spousal support of $ 100,000 a month
till the children reach majority ,
and shared custody .
i think it &apos;s too generous , but there you go .
we &apos;ll pass .
well , do you have a counter ?
vastly improved numbers for starters .
as i think we &apos;ve now established ,
mr. bishop &apos;s financial resources are apparently limitless .
she gets primary custody .
he can see his kids two weekends a month .
the offer is not going to improve .
we &apos;ll see what a court has to say .
katrina , this is not a good idea .
please ... talk to me , not my client .
and down the rabbit hole we go .
the judicial process will take over now .
the good news is that your wife is hosed financially .
your legitimate businesses are worthless on paper .
and now that we &apos;re out of mediation ,
we &apos;ll be able to preclude mention of any assets
that could lead to criminal exposure .
and my son ...
at trial ...
will he have to testify ?
thank you .
you crossed the line .
which one ?
you don &apos;t want zach being seen with his black girlfriend ?
it &apos;s not what i want .
polling shows peter will lose
if we don &apos;t have the blue collar and the suburban vote .
and they don &apos;t like black girlfriends ?
they don &apos;t like people they can &apos;t relate to .
it makes you look too ... cosmopolitan .
you don &apos;t know what voters want or think or anything .
you just make this stuff up
based on whatever biases
you have swirling around in your head at that moment .
i wish that were true .
well , you know what &apos;s true ?
zach is going to peter &apos;s speech with nisa .
do you know how crazy this is ?
for the last six months , i &apos;ve been asking you
to let me put the kids in front of the cameras ,
and you have said no ...
until i want them not in front of the cameras ,
and now you want the opposite .
yeah , eli , it &apos;s all about you .
we &apos;re the next case up .
i &apos;m sorry mediation has failed you , mr. bishop .
oh , you did your best .
i hope it hasn &apos;t soured you on the need for compromise .
i always tell myself ,
&quot; say a yes for every time you say a no and you &apos;ll be a happier person &quot; &quot;
y @-@ you understand what i mean .
no .
well , i guess what i mean is ,
if we can all work together , toward the same goals ,
each in our own way , then everyone can feel like they had a ...
you killed her .
you did it .
what ?
she o.d. &apos; d last night .
she &apos;s been clean for ten years
and what , she just decided to start using again ?
oh , my god .
okay , where did you hear this ?
you did it . you killed her .
i &apos;d watch my words , friend .
i didn &apos;t touch her .
but you get everything now , right ?
i mean , you get full custody .
and you get the cash .
okay , let &apos;s take this out of the hall .
you &apos;re a murderer .
stop this now .
don &apos;t say another word .
did you have something else you &apos;d like to share ?
good .
you ready ?
no matter what they ask ... the fifth .
you plead the fifth .
got it .
do you swear to tell the truth ,
the whole truth , and nothing but the truth , so help you god ?
i do .
now , we &apos;ve asked blake calamar back for another day of questioning ,
but you have no disagreement with his characterization of the conversation ?
i refuse to answer on the grounds that it may incriminate me .
again , we would speed things up here
if you allowed for a blanket pleading of the fifth .
and again , we would ask that miss sharma &apos;s attorney
honor the illinois state statute .
mr. calamar testified that you beat dr. booth with a bat .
and then you gave that weapon to him to hide .
is that true ?
i refuse to answer on the grounds that it may incriminate me .
you then , according to mr. calamar ,
took that same bat back from him
after knocking him unconscious . is that true ?
i refuse to answer on the grounds that it may incriminate me .
and since that time ,
have you ever tried to contact mr. calamar ?
can you ask me that again , please ?
why , certainly , miss sharma .
i asked , &quot; since that time ,
have you ever tried to contact mr. calamar ? &quot;
yes .
i &apos;d like to speak to my client .
no , mrs. florrick .
your client wishes to answer the question .
go ahead .
i tried to speak to him a few days ago .
i followed him to the hotel , but he was meeting someone .
and this hotel where you followed him ?
what hotel was that ?
it was a lake ... um ...
it was , uh , rolling crest suites in lake forest .
uh ... room 333 .
you said you tried to speak to mr. calamar .
so what prevented you ?
i saw that mr. calamar was meeting
with an african- american woman ,
so i did not contact him .
and why did you try to contact him ?
&apos;cause i wanted to ask him
why he was lying about me to a grand jury .
and if ... if i was this grand jury ,
i would be asking him the same questions .
my guess is mr. calamar won &apos;t even return here
after he hears my testimony .
did you really just do what i think you did ?
what do you think i just did ?
suggested that blake was the one sleeping with bishop &apos;s wife .
look , the lighting at the rolling crest suites was so dark ,
it could &apos;ve been blake .
alicia florrick .
this is cary agos .
how is your day going ?
fine , cary . how &apos;s yours ?
ah , i think i got a cold coming on .
well , i &apos;m really sorry to hear that .
another subpoena ?
well , oddly , no .
blake calamar , during his last visit to the grand jury ,
was asked some follow @-@ up questions
based on miss sharma &apos;s testimony ,
and you &apos;ll just never guess what happened .
i think i have an idea .
he asked for a brief recess ,
and didn &apos;t return to the grand jury room .
now , he &apos;s our only witness against miss sharma ,
so for now , we will not need her to return .
thank you , cary . i &apos;ll let her know .
do .
how are you , cary ?
i don &apos;t know .
may be tough sledding here for a while .
well , good luck .
thank you .
look at you .
your daughter &apos;s not going to be very happy with you .
no . she thinks i drink too much wine .
this is tequila .
cary was in on it , wasn &apos;t he ?
he knew what to ask you .
cary &apos;s a great guy .
oh , listen to you .
you and cary , sitting in a tree ...
hey , i &apos;m just shoring up friends .
for what ?
for the end days .
i have to buy a big house .
you have to ?
for appearances . i don &apos;t know .
i have to stop life from just happening , don &apos;t i ?
i don &apos;t want to buy a big house .
i like my apartment .
yeah , i like it too .
i used to have so many friends .
where are they now ?
now you lost me .
back then , my old life , the big house ?
i had all these ...
mom friends .
all talking about our weight .
yeah , i wish i knew you back then .
no .
i was ... different .
we would &apos;ve hated each other .
life changes , doesn &apos;t it ?
yeah , it does .
we can change it back .
we can do what we want .
who &apos;s that ?
blake .
you &apos;re kidding .
nope . he wants to meet .
well , you &apos;re not going to .
kalinda ...
hey , slugger .
i heard you were heading home .
yeah , yeah , thanks for that .
i felt you needed a little encouragement .
yeah , well , having bishop
after you for sleeping with his wife , that &apos;s ...
that &apos;s encouraging .
don &apos;t be a sore loser .
well , i ...
i finally got leela .
you finally got her .
yeah , i finally understood .
well , good for you .
it &apos;s a little bit too late , though , isn &apos;t it ?
not really .
met with an asa this afternoon ...
one last interview to fill them in .
what do you want , a medal ?
you see , i thought it was about why .
why you changed your name .
i thought there was some deep , dark secret in your past ,
but there really wasn &apos;t .
you just got bored with your old life .
yep , that &apos;s me , boring as they come .
but then i realized it wasn &apos;t about why .
it was about who .
who helped you change your name ?
&apos;cause i was looking for clues out there ,
and there were none , and it was odd .
then i realized that was the clue .
could we speed this up ?
see , someone helped you cover up the clues .
the biggest clue of all ended up being you , though .
you have a tell .
we into tells now ?
you overreact .
so i thought back to all the times you overreacted .
when i told alicia about leela ,
you destroyed my car .
when i asked you what alicia knew ,
you went psycho .
alicia . it &apos;s about alicia .
that &apos;s what you care about .
go home .
peter helped you change your name
at the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office , when you worked there .
peter helped you change your name .
and then you slept with him .
peter covered up everything for you .
for leela .
and you ... slept with him .
you &apos;re wrong .
that &apos;s good .
because i told the asa ,
and of course , you know , they have their process .
they &apos;ll probably ...
probably interview everyone involved and ...
they &apos;ll get it all straightened out .
