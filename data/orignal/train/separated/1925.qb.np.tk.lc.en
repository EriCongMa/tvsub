&quot; everything i try to do , nothing seems to turn out right &quot;
every action has an equal and opposite reaction .
emergency rooms are kept in business
by people who &apos;ve learned that lesson the hard way ...
you made waffles in our kitchen .
no , not me --
your sister , in between weepy phone calls with the fianc√© .
skydivers , bull riders --
people whose bold ideas can often result
in broken bones and smushed spleens .
well , being away from home is hard .
i &apos;ve been in d.c. for so long . i know how she feels .
you &apos;re the one who brought her here .
she doesn &apos;t need your sympathy .
she needs you to send her home .
now , did she say that ?
i &apos;m sure she &apos;s telling james all about
how we &apos;re holding her hostage .
well , we can negotiate the terms of her release
when i get home later tonight .
tonight ?
you and i have a surgery scheduled this afternoon together .
another meeting popped up .
i &apos;m gonna have amy cover for me .
mm !
sorry .
no . not you . the waffles are amazing .
i &apos;m gonna miss having a hostage .
surgeons are trained to deal with the fallout of bold ideas .
we pick up the pieces
and do our best to fit them back together .
guys , jo &apos;s dying .
they &apos;re stress hives .
i &apos;ve been a mess since i heard hunt and webber
talk about firing one of us .
you &apos;re a mess ? i &apos;ve gained eight pounds this week .
you could stop eating .
where do you even get these at 7 : 00 a.m. ?
drop it before i drop you .
you know who &apos;s not getting fired ? me .
i &apos;m gonna keep my head down and stay out of trouble .
no , we should be impressing them ,
showing them they need us .
wait . i &apos;m confused .
should i keep my head down , or should i put on a show ?
you just need to go one week
without having a nervous breakdown .
why does everything keep coming back to that ?
it happened once !
relax . hey , i &apos;m the one who &apos;s in trouble .
last one in , first one out .
oh , please .
even if you weren &apos;t dr. bailey &apos;s husband ,
you &apos;re still webber &apos;s favorite .
okay , i need two of you for rounds .
warren , murphy , let &apos;s go .
nice knowing you .
braden morris &apos; alc and t @-@ cell counts are fantastic .
do you think it might actually be time
for the boy to come out of the bubble ?
it would appear so .
so why do you look like i just punched a kitten ?
we can &apos;t send him home until i tell his parents
the truth about how i treated him .
and before i do that , i need to inform the board .
yang .
mm ?
i gave a patient a stem @-@ cell transplant
using deactivated h.i.v. as a viral vector
in order to cure his scid .
i did so against his parents &apos; wishes .
whoa .
did it work ?
damn right , it did .
up top ! hey !
i &apos;ve just informed the board .
now , let &apos;s go see his folks .
ooh , look at this cute , little fetus .
i want to send this to my mom .
of course , right after the first trimester --
two more weeks .
come on , that &apos;s far .
look , if we start telling people , we got to tell my mom .
she already tried to torpedo our relationship once
over a hypothetical child .
what do you think she &apos;s gonna do with a real one ?
oh . hey , guys .
hey . hi ! hey !
just , uh , having a checkup with old ob @-@ gyn ,
making sure all the parts are ... in order .
yeah .
both of you ?
callie torres ?
hi . yes . that &apos;s me .
uh , i think i can handle this on my own .
okay .
that was terrible !
and what &apos;s up with this ?
i don &apos;t know !
the , uh , first candidate &apos;s here
and waiting in the conference room .
mm . i &apos;m on my way now .
so , i still can &apos;t believe
he &apos;s making you pick your replacement .
i &apos;m interviewing dr. russell &apos;s replacement , not mine --
which i volunteered to do , by the way .
it &apos;s a punishment .
it &apos;s like making you clean the apartment you &apos;re vacating .
no , owen knows this is the right move for me .
he &apos;s been nothing but supportive .
mnh @-@ mnh .
something &apos;s coming . i can feel it in my bones .
ew .
i hate his face .
okay , now look me in the eye
and tell me this isn &apos;t a punishment .
thank you for this waffle .
all right , ms. campbell .
i &apos;m just gonna grab you some gauze and --
non @-@ adherent gauze , dr. kepner .
do you prefer tape or coban ?
where did you come from ?
oh , just trying to be useful , proactive .
finding needs and filling them --
that &apos;s my business .
30 @-@ year @-@ old male , motorcycle versus s.u.v.
complex scalp lac and bilateral hip dislocations .
vitals are stable .
wilson , you want to be useful ?
yeah .
take him to trauma one .
start the abcs , get him off the board ,
and get him his trauma x @-@ rays .
and i will join you as soon as i finish up
with ms. campbell over there .
absolutely . of course , dr. kepner .
thank you for the opportunity .
you &apos;re welcome !
i don &apos;t believe it .
we can take him home ?
absolutely .
oh !
this is just -- this is just wonderful .
thank you , dr. bailey .
thank you so much for hearing us
and just letting him get better on his own .
uh , mr. morris ...
braden did not get better on his own .
what do you mean ?
i gave him the treatment .
they did not react as i had hoped they would .
legal action never crossed your mind ?
i had hoped that they would see the bigger picture .
uh , dr. edwards should be excused .
she wasn &apos;t involved .
did she know what you were doing
and fail to report it ?
she was involved .
okay , um ...
i &apos;m gonna get someone on the phone from legal ,
and till i come back , don &apos;t go anywhere .
don &apos;t speak to anyone . don &apos;t move .
okay .
parents authorized your treatment with signed consent .
yes .
then they told dr. edwards that they changed their mind .
yes .
dr. edwards informed you , dr. bailey ,
of the parents &apos; withdrawal of consent .
yes .
yes .
and then you gave the patient
the stem @-@ cell transplant anyway .
have you told anyone else about this ?
i informed dr. yang this morning
as a representative of the board .
what did she say ?
she gave me a high @-@ five .
and did you apologize ?
to dr. yang ?
to the parents .
an apology could go a long way in circumstances like this .
an apology is only effective
when a mistake &apos;s been made .
i chose not to honor their wishes .
it wasn &apos;t a mistake .
all right , dr. ross .
tell us what &apos;s so special about little jacob here .
jacob has an omphalocele .
he was born with his abdominal organs outside of his body .
we &apos;ve been managing him with
daily application of silver @-@ sulfadiazine ointment
as a bridge to delayed closure .
and that &apos;s your job .
and to keep an eye on the other tiny humans .
it should be a quiet and adorable day .
look at you , all grown up .
how &apos;s the private sector ?
oh , couldn &apos;t be better .
i , uh , just came by to check on my inguinal @-@ hernia kid .
oh . oh , great . well , don &apos;t be a stranger .
yeah , you too .
hey , ross , hold up .
i &apos;m not gonna hit you .
i just , uh , want you to check up on an old patient of mine --
kevin platt , short @-@ gut kid .
did he get his s.t.e.p. procedure yet ?
robbins has it scheduled for wednesday .
he &apos;s here for tpn till then .
cool . got it .
that &apos;s my tablet .
monica zarr , 27 , in remission from rectal cancer .
okay .
uh , monica now suffers from poor sphincter control
due to her low anterior resection .
she &apos;s here today for the implantation
of the permanent rectal pacemaker .
gosh , when you say it , it sounds so sexy .
sorry .
honey , there &apos;s no need to apologize .
they &apos;re doctors .
um , monica , i asked you to keep records
of your movements after your last surgery .
right . the log log .
paul , give him the poop diary .
sure .
every 4 hours and 26 minutes .
the sacral @-@ nerve @-@ stimulator lead we implanted
should have cut your frequencies down far below this .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m gonna recommend
that we not implant the permanent pacemaker .
in fact , i think we should use the o.r. time
to remove the lead wire .
but i &apos;m pooping way less .
but it &apos;s not enough to consider the device effective .
we should explore some other options .
such as ?
antidiarrheals , high @-@ fiber diet , smaller meals .
i &apos;m a professional dancer .
my diet &apos;s pretty much leaves and twigs already .
there has to be something else .
sweetie , we made it through your cancer .
we &apos;ll make it through this .
i am so sorry . i couldn &apos;t help it .
but also , she farted like 80 times , and i did not laugh once .
no , you just belched to rattle the windows .
and dr. warren did neither ,
so he &apos;s gonna take the lead on the lap chole .
you prep monica for surgery .
yes , sir .
and take an antacid before you go back in there .
no , you need to bend the knee first .
did you get those x @-@ rays , wilson ?
think i &apos;d be in here if she hadn &apos;t ?
well , somebody &apos;s sure a grumpus today .
wilson , fill me in .
hey , what the hell ?
i &apos;ll be with you in two shakes of a lamb &apos;s tail , dr. torres .
vitals have been stable . trauma lab &apos;s done .
primary survey revealed a large , briskly bleeding scalp lac .
i put a pressure dressing on for you to assess .
c.t. negative for abdominal or intracranial hemorrhage ,
but did show bilateral hip dislocations ,
one anterior and one posterior ,
with an etabular wall fracture , but both have been reduced .
wilson , this traction pin &apos;s not gonna place itself . let &apos;s go .
oh , yes . sure . of course .
such a grumpus !
do you see this pin , kepner ?
you call me that nonsense word one more time ,
you won &apos;t like where i stick it .
so , you &apos;ll access the spine through the retroperitoneum ,
and i will perform the fusion with bone graft between l5 and s1 .
do you need to take that ?
nope .
so , derek usually does the --
you can take the call . it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s fine .
i &apos;m sorry .
just because derek and i
are having a hard time juggling our lives ,
that doesn &apos;t mean that we should keep you from yours .
you know what ? i liked you a lot better
when you were the sister @-@ in @-@ law who didn &apos;t give a crap .
could we just go back to that ? that would be great .
am i qualified to run the department ?
yikes . you know , not my call .
what i do know is that for some strange reason ,
since i was a resident , i keep getting thrown the riskiest ,
high @-@ profile cardiothoracic surgeries .
i mean , why me , you know ?
so , you did your fellowship
in philadelphia under jack alexander ?
oh , do you know dr. alexander ?
oh , such a great guy . really , sweet as pie .
which is why it was always a little embarrassing
when our chief of surgery would come to me for consults
instead of dr. alexander .
i took it as a compliment , but still , awkward .
knock , knock .
who &apos;s there ?
interrupting jellyfish .
interrupting je--
ohh ! that &apos;s my favorite one !
hey , dr. ross .
kevin doesn &apos;t need the t.p.n. this afternoon .
dr. karev said he could do his surgery today .
oh , that &apos;s -- but dr. robbins .
ross , let me explain short @-@ bowel syndrome to you .
kevin here is missing a big chunk of his small bowel ,
which means he needs surgery to lengthen it .
the sooner we operate , the sooner he goes home .
sound good to you ? - yeah .
we just need to transfer you onto my service .
dr. ross will pick up the paperwork for you .
hey , i should let dr. robbins know .
he &apos;s my patient .
or he will be , as soon as they sign the transfer papers .
i don &apos;t feel good about this .
you got two choices .
you can feel good about it and scrub in with me ,
or you can rat me out to robbins
and i tell her you didn &apos;t check placement
of some kid &apos;s feeding tube
and he nearly died from aspiration pneumonia .
but that &apos;s not true .
yeah , but i worked with her for years .
you went nuts and killed my dad .
who &apos;s she gonna believe ?
you &apos;ve already been the head of your own department
for two years .
you think i look too young .
i finished high school early .
also med school .
it &apos;s pretty annoying , right ?
yeah , it &apos;s pretty annoying .
excuse me . sorry to interrupt .
can i borrow dr. yang for a moment ?
excuse me .
hope you saved the big guns for last .
they &apos;re all solid candidates on paper ,
but between the humble @-@ bragger
and the girl who rode in on the big wheel --
cristina , i need to know
exactly what bailey said to you this morning .
about ?
her patient -- the deactivated h.i.v.
drawing a blank .
really ?
well , i &apos;ve been interviewing all day .
i &apos;m surprised i remember my own name .
you know what ? it &apos;s probably for the best .
oh , and ... go easy on these guys .
you know , they can &apos;t all be you .
dr. avery , i haven &apos;t held my son in months ,
and i want him to come out , but for all we know ,
she could be making up numbers to cover her own ass .
yeah , we can &apos;t trust that it &apos;s safe .
i mean , what if we get him home and something happens ?
you know what ? i understand your concerns .
what i &apos;m saying is if the labs show --
are you a parent , dr. avery ?
my , um -- my wife and i are , uh , expecting .
well , if someone did this to you , your child ,
how would you react ?
i &apos;ll go ahead and run some new labs for you myself .
all right , that might be enough weight .
all right . ready for that x @-@ ray ?
right away .
whoops ! looks like i need more irrigation .
uh , wilson , can you take over ?
yes , absolutely , dr. kepner .
&quot; absolutely dr. kepner . &quot;
who are you ? i thought you had grit .
i do ! i do have grit !
okay , well , all i see is some &quot; yes , ma &apos;am , no , ma &apos;am &quot; sissy girl ,
and there &apos;s no place in ortho for sissy girls .
do you hear me ?
check yourself before you wreck yourself .
sweetie , look .
this says yoga might help . you love yoga .
are you crazy ? i can &apos;t do downward dog .
in a hot room ?
a bunch of yoga won &apos;t get me my job back .
you lost your job over this ?
they can &apos;t fire you over something you can &apos;t control .
after the cancer ,
i was supposed to have my big return to the stage .
i was able to make it through rehearsals ,
running back and forth to the bathroom ,
but then , the first full run @-@ through ,
no breaks ...
oh , no .
... blastoff , in the middle of a pirouette .
the fact that it didn &apos;t happen in front of an audience
is the only thing that kept me from shooting myself in the face .
she &apos;s exaggerating .
paul , it was like frickin &apos; spin art .
hey , where &apos;s kevin platt ?
dr. karev took him up to surgery .
hey , what , are you poaching patients now ?
i didn &apos;t poach anything .
you stole my short @-@ gut kid .
all right .
up until a few weeks ago , he was our short @-@ gut kid .
look , his parents know me . they &apos;re fine with this .
consents are signed , and he &apos;s just about ... prepped .
ross ?
really ?
the kid &apos;s on the operating table .
what do you want me to do ?
this was a jerk @-@ ass move , karev ,
and you know it .
so , no one &apos;s qualified ?
no , i mean , they &apos;re all qualified ...
but owen &apos;s right .
i need to accept that none of them are gonna be me .
that &apos;s his plan .
what &apos;s his plan ?
owen . didn &apos;t make sense before .
a fellow interviewing potential department heads ,
showing you a bunch of people you won &apos;t like
to get you to stay . he wants to offer you the job .
mer , you -- you &apos;re thinking about this way too hard .
you don &apos;t offer a first @-@ year attending
head of cardiothoracic surgery . it &apos;s just not done .
you just got hired to run an entire research facility .
you &apos;re perfect for the job .
wait , two seconds ago ,
i wasn &apos;t qualified to interview the candidates ,
and now you &apos;re saying that i &apos;m perfect for the job ?
yeah , because you &apos;re you .
okay , i &apos;m lost .
is owen the one plotting to keep me here , or are you ?
now you &apos;re the one thinking about it too hard .
she &apos;s a dancer . this isn &apos;t just a job .
this is who she is .
and we &apos;re just gonna send her home
farting and pooping uncontrollably
for the rest of her life ?
and we &apos;re done with the chili .
webber told you to take an antacid .
i did !
i drank half a bottle , and it didn &apos;t do anything ,
and then i got all anxious about that ,
and the next thing you know , i &apos;m on the train to pizza town .
you know what you need ? a magnetic esophageal sphincter .
bailey put one in an old lady last week --
a ring of little magnets
at the end of the esophagus , just above the stomach .
lets food in , stays closed so you don &apos;t keep ...
... doing that .
yes . yes .
p @-@ please get that thing .
it &apos;s a magnetic sphincter ?
yeah .
so , if it closes the opening for the food on the way in ,
wouldn &apos;t it work on the way out ?
what , for our cancer dancer ?
it &apos;s actually pretty good .
yeah . you should pitch it to webber .
hey , edwards , um , you &apos;ve been working with bailey , right ?
she was supposed to meet me for lunch ,
but she hasn &apos;t returned any of my calls . something up ?
what the hell &apos;s the matter with you ?
how could you be so reckless ? - whoa , how did you --
i had to hear it from edwards !
i sure as hell didn &apos;t hear it from you !
i couldn &apos;t tell you .
i didn &apos;t want you to have to lie for me .
dr. warren , i &apos;d appreciate it if you stepped outside .
look , she is my wife .
okay , um ...
the lawyers are meeting now .
we &apos;re discharging braden soon ,
but it does not look like the morrises are gonna let this go .
so it looks like a malpractice suit ?
worse .
assault and battery charges .
tuck &apos;s soccer practice is gonna be over soon .
i was supposed to pick him up . can you ?
there &apos;s nothing you can do for me here .
braden &apos;s coming out of the bubble ?
yeah .
i wish i could have seen that .
suction , please .
you can go , ross . i &apos;ve got it from here .
come on . we &apos;re in the middle of a surgery here .
i know . you stole my patient , but you can &apos;t steal ross .
he works for us . he &apos;s my resource ,
and i need him in the nicu doing what he was told to do .
you need an assist ? you &apos;ve got one .
how can i be of help to you ?
sorry , i &apos;m having a little bit of trouble
dividing these branching vessels .
i can retract the iliac vein medially
to help with exposure .
thanks .
derek &apos;s coming home tonight .
yep .
which means you can go home .
i understand .
i &apos;m sorry .
you were just trying to be nice , and i bit your head off .
i will be out of your hair first thing tomorrow .
oh , that ? no . this is not about that .
i &apos;ve already forgotten you said that .
so , this isn &apos;t you kicking me out for being a bitch ?
no . no , we love having you here ,
but we don &apos;t want to keep you from your life
any more than we have to , so ...
what &apos;s so funny ?
n-- i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s just ...
if i had spoken to anyone at seaside wellness
the way i spoke to you , i @-@ i would have to have
a conversation for six hours about it .
i love it here .
james and i have not been fighting
about the fact that i &apos;m still here .
we have been fighting
about the fact that i never want to leave .
so , you want to give me a bionic butthole ?
it &apos;s magnetic .
yeah , it was dr. murphy &apos;s idea .
well , it &apos;s commonly used as the esophageal sphincter
to reduce reflux and prevent food from coming back up the throat ,
but we think , with a bit of modification ,
that it might work just as well for your stool .
have you done this before ?
no , but , uh , it wouldn &apos;t be the first time
that a medical device was adapted to something
other than its original intention .
but , uh , we &apos;re willing to give it a shot if you are .
w @-@ what do you think , honey ?
yes . please .
thank you .
oh , my god . thank you .
paul , you okay ?
i am ecstatic .
my heart broke when dr. webber said the pacemaker wouldn &apos;t work ,
but now you can have a normal life .
i mean , you can be comfortable .
this can all end here .
baby , i love you so much ,
and , i mean , that cancer was one thing ,
but i don &apos;t know how much more of this i could take .
i @-@ i @-@ i -- the smell -- - okay , yeah .
we &apos;ll take one magnetic butthole , please .
20 pounds . let &apos;s see if it &apos;s fully reduced this time .
all right , you ready to shoot ?
uh , wait . i &apos;m almost finished .
okay , well , i need to make sure that his hip
isn &apos;t grinding on broken bone pieces .
yeah . hold o-- just give me a second .
just put on a lead apron !
please give me a second !
kepner . dr. kepner , put on the damn apron !
torres , i can &apos;t be in here
while you do the x @-@ ray .
um ... wilson , take over for dr. kepner .
god , you &apos;re so weird today .
i &apos;m sorry . i -- - shut it .
just shut it .
i &apos;m telling you , kid , this is the place to be .
it &apos;s quiet .
the company &apos;s great .
you and me , we got a lot in common .
my intestines are on the inside , but still ,
i know what it &apos;s like to feel exposed .
if we stick together ,
i think we &apos;ll be okay .
in fact ...
what the hell , man ! i thought we were friends !
his omphalocele &apos;s ruptured !
get me saline , sterile dressings ,
and vicryl mesh , now !
reload stapler .
you &apos;re not gonna oversew the staple lines ?
staples alone should do it .
hmm . you don &apos;t want to take the time ?
i mean , i would , but , you know , i don &apos;t like leaks , so ...
this isn &apos;t my first s.t.e.p. procedure .
oh , i know . i taught you how to do your first s.t.e.p. procedure ,
which is why it blows my mind that you would try and poach my patient .
why are you making such a big deal ?
because it &apos;s freaking rude , alex ,
and i don &apos;t deserve to be treated like that .
i taught you better than this . you &apos;re out in the world now ...
... but what you do reflects on me ,
and i do not approve of this , and neither will lebackes .
so , what , you &apos;re gonna tattle on me ?
dr. robbins , you &apos;re needed in nicu . 911 .
and i spearheaded a hybrid o.r. that offered more flexibility
between non @-@ invasive and invasive techniques --
gamma cameras , the whole works .
i definitely want to bring that here .
wow , impressive .
uh , well , do you have any questions for me ?
one .
there &apos;s a rumor that working here
means giving up hope of ever winning the harper avery .
oh . that &apos;s ...
that would make a difference for you ?
of course it would .
i mean , it &apos;s the goal , right ?
i assume it &apos;s why you &apos;re leaving .
no .
you &apos;ll probably never win a harper avery .
i &apos;ve known people who have deserved harper averys ,
and people who have won them ,
and the thing they all have in common was
the work .
they are focused on the work and the patient ,
on making someone better or someone whole
or someone live .
that &apos;s their goal .
so ... no .
i mean , you , specifically ,
will never win a harper avery .
not if that &apos;s what you &apos;re after .
uh ... so , that &apos;s --
you know , i wouldn &apos;t give this
place another thought . you &apos;d be a terrible fit .
i don &apos;t know what happened .
it burst , ross . that &apos;s what happened . move .
fran , get me a larger vicryl mesh . i need to protect his organs .
can i do anything ?
you can step outside .
go .
we ran the labs twice ,
and his immune @-@ system values are within the normal range .
let &apos;s do it .
okay .
okay .
come on .
oh , baby !
she went about it the wrong way ,
but bailey &apos;s treatment did work .
a @-@ a @-@ are you looking for a &quot; thank you , &quot; dr. hunt ?
she &apos;s lucky he &apos;s alive ,
because we &apos;re only gonna take her license .
when we &apos;re done , she won &apos;t practice medicine ever again .
and if we lost him ,
i wouldn &apos;t stop until she was behind bars . i --
it wasn &apos;t dr. bailey &apos;s fault .
she didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
it &apos;s my fault he got the treatment .
it &apos;s mine .
i @-@ i forgot to tell her you wanted to
withdraw consent , so she just went ahead ,
and when i told her the truth , she covered for me .
it was a mistake .
you forgot ? !
you just ... forgot ? !
hold on . david , please .
look , dr. edwards is a resident , a trainee ...
and if you want to yell at someone , then --
in what world does that make it okay ?
my son could have died ,
and you &apos;re just gonna stand there and tell me that
it &apos;s okay because it would have been a mistake ? !
david .
wha--
honey .
david , come here .
come here .
sit down .
david , he &apos;s alive ,
and he &apos;s healthy , and we can take him home .
maybe -- maybe we should just go home , hm ?
can we , dad ? can we go home ?
okay .
you &apos;re gonna want to position the ring in apposition
at the level of the anorectal junction .
good . uh , careful .
okay , once it &apos;s aligned ,
we &apos;ll use the attached sutures to tie the ends together .
like this ?
n @-@ no .
now , you need to provide passive reinforcement to the canal .
that &apos;s better .
now , don &apos;t add tension when you throw your knots .
when it &apos;s connected ,
we will confirm placement with the fluoro .
how far along are you ?
10 weeks , today .
i know it &apos;s still early .
we &apos;re not really supposed to be telling anyone , but ...
but we &apos;re happy about it ?
yeah .
yeah , we are . we &apos;re really ...
really happy .
oh , hey .
thanks .
oh , those -- those tears aren &apos;t --
aren &apos;t for me , are they ?
there &apos;s a reason you were such a grumpus today ?
that is not a word !
sorry . i know .
my mom says it .
it sounds so stupid that once you hear it ,
it &apos;s hard to stay angry .
note to self -- does not work on callie .
we &apos;re trying to have another baby ...
and , uh , i had an appointment this morning ,
you know , just to get the lay of the land .
but , uh , i guess since the car accident ,
i &apos;ve developed all these adhesions ,
and so i can &apos;t carry another baby .
callie , i &apos;m so sorry .
no , i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry , too .
wilson , we need to put a bell on you .
i owe you both an apology for snapping .
we overed that one of the residents
isn &apos;t coming back next year ,
and i &apos;ve just been so afraid that it might be me .
could be .
totally possible .
it &apos;s not that james isn &apos;t amazing . he is .
i mean , he really helped me through something .
but i &apos;m through it now , you know ?
i mean , i &apos;m on the other side , you know ?
and now , when i stop and look around , i just --
i don &apos;t think i need him anymore ,
which is terrible , right ?
i @-@ i @-@ i don &apos;t know .
when we &apos;re done here ,
i am gonna go and meet with our patient &apos;s family ,
and then i &apos;m gonna go home and bake a cake with your kids
and read them a really long bedtime story .
and then , when i have absolutely no more ways of avoiding
breaking the heart of this man who deserves better ,
i &apos;m gonna call james ,
and i &apos;m gonna tell him that i love him ...
but i can &apos;t do this anymore .
she &apos;s lying !
bailey , that is enough .
i understand you wanting to protect our residents ,
but you should not have let it go this far .
well , you &apos;re taking her word over mine !
it is over , bailey .
the morrises have agreed to drop the charges
in exchange for edwards receiving
one week &apos;s disciplinary suspension .
they have gone home .
you should both do the same .
what the hell is wrong with you ? !
if you got fired over this ,
no one would benefit from this treatment
the way braden did .
you were gonna go down for this , dr. bailey .
you knew it could happen , but you were willing
to risk everything to save that little boy .
what kind of surgeon would
i be if i wasn &apos;t willing to do the same ?
plus , there &apos;s a chance i won &apos;t even be here next year ,
so i was just rolling the dice .
i was looking at the bigger picture .
you &apos;re not going anywhere without a fight from me .
if it &apos;s all right with you , sir ,
i &apos;d like to stay on monica &apos;s case .
i want to be there when she comes back for a follow @-@ up .
come over here .
let &apos;s ... let &apos;s have a seat .
that was a good move today , murphy .
you &apos;re very bright , and you have what it takes
to be a very good doctor .
but you &apos;re not a surgeon .
what ?
standing next to you in surgery today only confirmed it .
you make five moves
where a second @-@ year resident should make two .
your knots aren &apos;t square .
you can &apos;t see the planes of dissection .
next year , you &apos;d only fall farther behind .
n-- i @-@ i can work harder .
i can -- i can do better .
a surgical residency
just isn &apos;t the right fit for you .
is ...
is this because i filed that harassment complaint ?
no , murphy . no .
letting you go isn &apos;t a punishment .
it &apos;s a kindness .
and you deserve every opportunity
to figure out what your next steps might be .
in the meantime , dr. miller
at the university of washington runs a research lab ,
and i think you would do very well there .
she owes me a favor .
i &apos;d be more than happy to make a phone call .
thank you , sir .
so , observe him carefully overnight ,
and in a few weeks , we &apos;ll do a double @-@ thickness skin graft .
okay .
what , did you come to steal more babies ?
don &apos;t tell lebackes .
oh , god . that makes it worse .
you-- get out .
look , i &apos;m sorry .
i screwed up .
kind of ...
i &apos;m drowning over there .
here , cases come in all the time .
i can prove myself .
over there , if you &apos;re not bringing in the cases ,
you &apos;re not bringing in the money , and you &apos;re a nobody .
i don &apos;t want to lose this gig .
i didn &apos;t know what else to do .
i &apos;m in trouble , and i need help .
what do you mean ?
when something like this happens ,
you call me , and you say ,
&quot; arizona , i &apos;m in trouble , and i need help . &quot;
and i help you .
do you understand ?
right .
i couldn &apos;t tell you .
so you said .
i -- i need to know .
this risk , w @-@ was it absolutely necessary ?
he was dying .
and i created something out of thin air .
i took a virus that kills
into something that heals ,
and i saved his life .
i saved his life .
* for i toss and turn *
* i can &apos;t sleep at night *
* once i ran to you *
* i ran *
* now i run from you *
* this tainted love ... *
you know , i &apos;ve thought about it ,
and if you want to send the ultrasound to your mom ,
that wouldn &apos;t be the worst thing .
you &apos;ve told ! i d-- - i @-@ i kind of --
who did you tell ?
stephanie ?
so , after all the crap you gave me this morning ,
you went and told your ex @-@ girlfriend ?
it was an accident , okay ? i &apos;m sorry .
i forgive you .
thanks .
still don &apos;t know how we &apos;re gonna tell my mom .
what do you mean , &quot; we &quot; ?
that is all you , talkie tina .

how are your hives ?
oh , my back looks like
a political map of the united states --
big mess of red down the middle , plus alaska .
bad day ?
bad day .
did you pop a baby ? i popped a baby .
i don &apos;t even know what that could mean .
and do not elaborate .
you guys are gonna be fine .
that &apos;s easy for you to say .
your big victory in the o.r. -- you &apos;re fine .
one of us is definitely going down .
come on , let &apos;s go drink about it .
you really think i &apos;m gonna be okay ?
i really do .
go , go , go . i &apos;ll meet you there .
well , i -- i could do it .
no .
i could .
i could carry the baby .
i won &apos;t ask you to .
but i &apos;m offering .
because we want this .
i want this .
and i can do it .
we just got good again .
now we &apos;re too fragile .
and something like this --
if it goes badly , we won &apos;t make it .
i &apos;m not gonna put us in that position .
okay .
okay .
we have a beautiful life .
we have a beautiful daughter .
and that can be enough , right ?
yes .
that can be enough .
i love you , calliope .
i love you , too .
how &apos;d it go ? do we have a new head of cardio ?
ugh , i don &apos;t know .
i did screen all these applicants before they came to you .
they couldn &apos;t have been all that bad .
no , they &apos;re mostly fine .
no , not fine . good .
any one of them could do the job .
except humble @-@ bragger .
what ?
the harper avery foundation &apos;s been looking for ways
to mend fences with us
after what happened to you .
a large cash infusion into our cardio department
could allow us to attract a higher @-@ caliber of talent ,
and then -- - owen , don &apos;t .
the worst they can do could allow us say no to
please don &apos;t -- - higher @-@ caliber of talent ,
please don &apos;t offer me this job .
i wanted to ...
for a week .
but i know you have to go .
and i know nothing good
can come of me asking you to stay .
so i &apos;m not .
and i won &apos;t .
thank you .
but i will ask you something else .
what ?
owen ...
just until you go .
don &apos;t leave me until you &apos;re leaving me .
just until you go .
hey , stranger !
what are you drinking ?
you know what ? doesn &apos;t matter . you can dump it out .
this is better .
champagne is perfect , because ...
i was wrong about the amelia situation .
she doesn &apos;t want to leave . she wants to stay .
she can take over your service .
she can help out with the kids .
you can brain map to your heart &apos;s content .
i don &apos;t have to pull my hair out .
it is the answer we &apos;ve been looking for .
this is great !
it is , right ?
amy can move to seattle , and we can move to d.c.
that wasn &apos;t the point of my story .
i met him , meredith .
i met the president .
he came to us .
we walked him through everything we &apos;ve been working on .
and then , at the end of it , he said that
he wanted to make this a weekly thing .
they offered me a position at the n.i.h.
it &apos;s the job .
i &apos;ll be right there , on the ground ,
doing the actual brain @-@ mapping work myself .
they &apos;ve given me everything .
well , we can &apos;t just ... pack up
and move across the country .
they have promised to have an attending position
waiting for you at james madison hospital .
the thing about the bold moves ...
they &apos;re terrifying .
could end in nothing but tears and broken bones .
if amy wants to move to seattle ,
she can take over my practice
without me hovering over her , and she will thrive .
alex is leaving , cristina &apos;s moving on .
they &apos;re -- they all have their next step .
this could be our next step .
this should be our next step .
