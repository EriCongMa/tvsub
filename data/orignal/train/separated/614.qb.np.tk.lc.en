you are to escort it to helios .
are you mad ? across the desert ? !
i will pay you handsomely .
the desert is home to thieves , murderers , cut @-@ throats ...
perhaps your reputation as a man of courage is unfounded .
to journey to helios is not an act of courage -
it is an act of lunacy .
a thousand now .
a thousand when you return .
when do we leave ?
hercules !
your caravan departs at dawn .
may i ask why we &apos;re doing this ?
my son , philemon , is due to marry .
this is the bride price .
you can be rest assured it will be delivered safe and sound .
good .
because if you lose the cargo ...
.. you lose your fingers .
every last one of you .
every last finger .
is that clear ?
painfully .
are you insane ? !
the desert can be lovely at this time of year .
what about the thieves , murderers and cut @-@ throats ?
all myth . the greeks are full of them .
it &apos;d take more than that to scare me .
what is it ?
what are you doing ?
more than you .
if you gave us a hand ...
we are being followed .
it &apos;s a goat !
stop , stop !
do you know him ?
he &apos;s my brother .
three !
luck !
skill .
can you give us a hand ?
four !
four , four - knock on the door !
i &apos;m the one the girls adore !
hercules , we have to be on our way by dawn .
where ?
it &apos;s work . we have to go .
i &apos;m sorry . we need the money .
i can come with you .
no .
why not ?
it &apos;s too dangerous .
he looks like he &apos;ll be more use with a sword than you .
where are you going ?
helios .
then i &apos;m your man !
excellent . that &apos;s decided then , he &apos;s coming with us .
medusa .
get off !
oh , why did you have to wake me ?
i was having the most glorious dream .
medusa and i ...
i really don &apos;t want to know .
come on . the caravan leaves in less than an hour .
unless you want usto cross the desert alone ,
you need to get a move on .
wait , wait , wait .
where &apos;s the trunk ? !
you &apos;re sleeping on it .
where are my clothes ?
you lost them - gambling . - oh ... oh , arcas ...
i &apos;m sure he &apos;ll give them back if you asked him nicely .
finally , someone with a skill in this house .
why did pythagoras not tell us he has a gambling genius for a brother ?
i don &apos;t know .
one thing &apos;s for sure , though - he wasn &apos;t pleased to see him .
i have come to seek the wisdom of poseidon .
i have not seen you here before .
no .
you have a question for me ?
i am to travel to helios .
you wish to pray for protection ?
yes .
no .
i ...
i wish to know if we will crossthe desert safely .
your journey will take you far beyond helios .
for you are about to embark on a voyage of the soul .
what does that mean ?
that you have good reason to be concerned .
i don &apos;t understand .
the question you posed was not plain - neither is the answer .
then tell me .
what will befall us ?
you , and you alone ...
.. will determine that .
i should not go .
whatever you decide ,
the time of reckoning is upon you .
try as you may , you will not avert it .
i am grateful .
i sense a darkness in your heart .
do you want to share it ?
no .
it is my burden to live with ...
.. and mine to die with .
as you wish .
hercules , help him !
oh , yes .
everybody , out of his way . come on . out of the way ! move !
can &apos;t you see he &apos;s carrying something ? !
step to the side . step to the side , please , sir .
to one side , one or the other .
this way .
so my father finally found someone to guard his precious cargo .
there &apos;s always someone fool enough , i suppose .
you must be the lucky bridegroom .
indeed .
it is our humble honour to be at the service of
so praiseworthy a man as yourself .
save your back . i &apos;m not my father .
have this man load it onto one of the horses .
oh , no , this stays at my side .
as you wish .
put this on the grain .
excuse me ?
can you help me , please ?
yes .
allow me .
thank you .
it &apos;s my pleasure .
murderer !
no , no . what &apos;re you doing ?
look ! it is the mark of a murderer .
leave him .
he works for me .
and what he may or may not have done in the past
is nothing to do with you .
it is if i &apos;m travelling with him .
i decide who travels and who doesn &apos;t .
i &apos;m sorry .
he &apos;s fine .
i &apos;ll look after him .
yeah , you &apos;d better .
when we &apos;re in the desert ,
if you want to stay alive , you do as i say .
that goes for all of you .
in the desert , we are all brothers .
otus , finish loading up , then move them on .
what was that about ?
it &apos;s just the way he is .
the man had done nothing to him .
he &apos;s a murderer .
my father was killed .
arcas was very young .
it affected him badly .
that must have been hard for you .
it was harder for him .
because he never knew what my father was really like .
you talk to him .
i have .
otus was a chattel ,
enslaved on the island of samos .
that &apos;s where i grew up .
he dared to speak out , and they cut out his tongue .
one day , otus sought his revenge .
he &apos;s paid his price .
and he &apos;s a good man ,
so if your brother lays one hand on him
then he will have me to reckon with .
i &apos;m sorry .
don &apos;t be .
i couldn &apos;t help it .
you should be careful how you judge people .
i &apos;ve put all of that behind me .
you need to do the same .
yeah .
thanks .
they ... they were to share .
what &apos;s your business in helios ?
i have family .
it &apos;s unusual to see a lady travelling alone .
i was assured that travelling with nilas i would be safe .
a woman shouldn &apos;t be here .
mark my words - she will bring misfortune on us all .
here .
you &apos;re very kind .
why don &apos;t you come and join us ?
don &apos;t listen to them .
he &apos;s scared .
we all are .
perhaps later .
what did she say to you ?
what do you mean ?
something &apos;s not right .
look at the way she eats .
no lady eats like that .
she &apos;s hungry !
what i &apos;d do to bathe in the fountains of babylon .
look like you already have .
these wretched flies !
and whose idea was this ?
even when he &apos;s asleep there &apos;s no peace .
get some rest .
how &apos;s your brother ?
you weren &apos;t expecting him to turn up .
no .
why not ?
we don &apos;t always see eye to eye .
he &apos;s young .
perhaps .
you &apos;re not pleased to see him ?
of course i am .
i know you .
you really should get some rest .
what is it ?
pythagoras ...
it &apos;s nothing .
well , at least he &apos;s not complaining .
i &apos;ll wake you when it &apos;s your turn .
hercules !
get the cargo to safety !
i &apos;ve been practising .
get in the cave . now !
come on !
why aren &apos;t they following us ?
what is this place ?
it is sacred to the furies ,
spirits who pursue murderers like them .
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;ve stayed here many times .
thank you .
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re all right .
i doubted you . i was wrong .
my , a man who can admit it .
i owe you my life .
and a drink .
i don &apos;t even know your name .
baucis .
see - i was right about her .
no lady fights like that .
we should be grateful she did .
something &apos;s not right .
you don &apos;t know that .
trust me .
i have an instinct about these things .
these furies ,
are they gods ?
no .
they are the daughters of the night .
spirits born of the blood of those that have been murdered .
you &apos;d do well not to deride them .
once summoned , they know no mercy .
for the murderer , there is no hiding place .
they will pursue him to the ends of the earth ,
driven by the anger and hurt of those that have been wronged .
they sense only what is
in the heart of the man that invoked them .
he alone can recall them .
for without his true forgiveness there is no escape .
it &apos;s bats .
nothing more .
hear me ...
.. daughters of the night .
to you who feel my suffering .
to you who know the murderer of my father ,
i call to you ...
.. that he may meet your justice .
i beg you , unloose this hatred from my heart
and wreak your revenge .
jason .
i thought i heard a noise .
don &apos;t let those stories get to you .
no .
no , you &apos;re right .
it &apos;s a sign from the gods .
it &apos;s a dead bird .
some see it as a warning .
a foreshadowing of hardship and death .
this is a trick .
the thieves we encountered last night wishing to scare us .
put the bird from your mind .
let &apos;s pack up and move out .
i listened to what you said . you &apos;re right .
i &apos;m going to put the past behind me .
you mean that ?
i think i can now .
you all right ?
yes .
what was that ?
the wind .
the desert is a strange place .
as dangerous as any thief
if you allow it into your head .
keep together .
oh , i hate this desert .
i thought you said it was lovely at this time of year .
stop !
the chest ! she &apos;s taken it .
who ?
the girl !
i told you .
you were right .
oh , but you never listen to me , do you ?
yes , i do .
well , if you had
she wouldn &apos;t have run off with the gold , would she ? !
but the ... the chest was ... full .
i swapped it .
you &apos;re a genius .
i &apos;m going to kiss you .
you don &apos;t have to kiss me back .
come on .
come on .
you saw it ?
what are you doing ?
it was dust .
come on , we &apos;ve got a long way to travel .
that was more than dust .
he has not been dead long .
i was set upon by thieves .
all i beg of you is a horse .
we don &apos;t have one .
she can share mine .
you &apos;ve had too much sun , philemon .
if we take her with us ,
how do we know she won &apos;t do the same thing again ?
it &apos;s my cargo .
i &apos;ll take that risk .
we don &apos;t know anything about her .
baucis , is that even your true name ?
but you &apos;re no lady .
just a common thief .
i &apos;m sorry .
she deserves nothing . let &apos;s go .
when we set out , you said that we were to act as brothers .
and how did she treat us ?
we are better than that .
if we leave her , she will die .
in fact , you may as well kill her now .
is that what you want ?
i agree with philemon .
i say we take her with us .
very well .
thank you .
you saved my life .
the least i can do is return the favour .
i &apos;ve told you - it &apos;s the desert , nothing more .
who &apos;s that ?
jason .
i &apos;m getting as nervous as you .
come on . i &apos;ll give you a hand .
pythagoras !
no !
no !
help me !
help me !
we need to get out of here .
it &apos;ll come after us .
something happened last night and all day i &apos;ve felt it .
something is following us .
with all my heart i hope that i am wrong .
what ?
these are the furies .
but they do not strike without being summoned .
it was me .
i called them .
i asked for revenge on the man that murdered our father .
and you are from samos .
that can mean only one thing . it was you .
it was you they were after .
you murdered him !
no ! arcas , stop !
why ?
it wasn &apos;t him .
it was me .
please .
it was an accident .
i didn &apos;t mean to kill him .
i swear to you , it wasn &apos;t my fault .
nilas !
we must pray for sunrise .
the daughters of the night will not attack in daylight .
leave me .
why ?
you will die .
you said that the furies could be called off .
you can stop this .
never .
he killed him .
i was defending our mother .
he was drunk .
i pleaded with him , but he was hitting her .
i pushed him away , but he came at me .
he fell ...
you murdered him .
i tried to help him .
but ...
his head .
it was bleeding .
it was too late .
you lied to me for all this time .
you were young .
it was our mother &apos;s idea .
she did not want you to know what he was like .
you &apos;re blaming her now .
when you were older i wanted to tell you ,
but i knew you would not believe me .
you &apos;re lying now to save your skin .
you know in your heart that he did not mean to kill your father .
all you need to do is show your forgiveness
and the furies will relent .
arcas ...
you &apos;re the only one that can save him !
i believe you .
go !
it &apos;s me they want .
if you don &apos;t go now , you won &apos;t get the chance .
no . all of you go , bring back arcas .
it &apos;s safer than staying here .
go with them .
this is my fate , not yours .
i won &apos;t think any less of you .
we &apos;re staying .
that food &apos;s got to last !
how long do you think we &apos;re going to live ? !
hercules !
come on !
arcas !
he &apos;s your brother !
go back !
save him !
oh , careful ! sorry .
you &apos;re too heavy .
oh , so it &apos;s my fault
we just saved your life .
and broke my back !
how does it feel ?
it looks worse than it is . you &apos;ll be fine .
just think of all the pies you &apos;re going to eat in helios .
isn &apos;t that right , pythagoras ?
this is my fault .
help me tie this .
it &apos;s me they want .
go ! leave me here .
this is what friends are for .
not to die for me .
no .
to save you .
give me your hand .
pythagoras ...
pythagoras !
stay here .
don &apos;t leave me !
all right , then , leave me .
you &apos;re going to let them die ?
he killed my father .
he didn &apos;t intend it .
you know your brother .
he &apos;s a good man .
people make mistakes and they should be punished .
they should also be forgiven .
listen to her , please .
i &apos;ve made my decision .
are you trying to get yourself killed ?
it &apos;s what i deserve .
no , get off me !
if we make it through tonight ,
then at least we have a chance .
of what ?
making it to the next night , and the next ?
this is it , for ever till i die .
get back !
come on .
i had to find a way to get him back to the rocks .
i knew he would never leave me .
if you give yourself up to the furies ,
i won &apos;t get him back to helios alone .
are you really going to let him die ?
pythagoras !
jason , take my hand .
i , arcas , son of mnesarchus ,
forgive the man who murdered my father .
i call to you to cease your vengeance .
it has to come from your heart .
you have to forgive him completely .
you have to mean it !
i can &apos;t !
please .
he is the kindest man i have ever known .
i &apos;m sorry , arcas .
pythagoras !
you came back ?
it was baucis .
i didn &apos;t know you had it in you .
he &apos;s my only brother .
so if you &apos;d had another .. ?
yeah , it might &apos;ve been a bit different .
we made it .
i told you i &apos;d get you here .
ah , food ! at last !
i &apos;ll get you some water .
thank you .
i was too quick to judge you .
you have a good heart .
so do you .
i have our father &apos;s anger .
i &apos;m not coming back to atlantis .
i need to make a life for myself .
you &apos;re always welcome .
so where does your bride live ?
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;ve never met her .
and i don &apos;t want to .
your father chose her .
it &apos;s the way of my family .
we &apos;re going to travel on to cyrene - take our chances there .
you sure you know what you &apos;re doing ?
i think so .
so , do we know where we &apos;re delivering these riches ?
uh ... well ...
ah , you thought i was a fool for accepting medios &apos;s offer ,
but i never doubted we &apos;d succeed
for we are men of pluck ,
of mettle
and unerring courage .
you can put all that mathematics to good use by telling us
what we &apos;re each about to get paid .
nothing .
philemon isn &apos;t getting married .
we can &apos;t deliver the bride price .
we have to take it back to atlantis .
across the desert ? !
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re making me do this .
we could always leave the cargo in helios .
but then we &apos;d lose our fingers .
better that than losing my life !
that &apos;s not going to happen .
you said it yourself .
&quot; because we are men of pluck ...
.. &quot; of mettle ... &quot; ..
&quot; and unfailing courage . &quot;
it was unnerving ... unerring courage .
i hate this desert .
i wish for you to retrieve ...
.. a box .
it is to be found in campe &apos;s lair in hades .
