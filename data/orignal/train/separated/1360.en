Whoa, whoa. Hey, stop it.
There is nothing in there except for rabbits, squirrels.
Nothing -- you're fine.
Damn it!
Angus, come back here!
Angus!
Angus?
Here, boy.
Angus?
Come on, buddy.
Angus, come here, boy.
Angus, what's wrong, buddy?
Oh, my god.
No.
No.
Would you get --
No,mom.
En garde.
You do know I carry a gun.
Aha!
Don't touch! Don't.
Come on. Give me your jacket.
Stop it.
Hey, you two, knock it off. Somebody's gonna get hurt.
She started it.
Well, she can't go to work with whatever that is all over her.
I was gonna shake it off once I got to the office.
Give it here.
Ma
come on.
Okay, what is that?
Looks like low-grade foam rubber,
the kind used in inexpensive throw pillows,
chair cushions, and cheap furniture.
It's from my couch.
What? The duct tape came loose.
Duct tape?
Yeah. Greeks use windex.
Rizzolis use duct tape.
It has a hole in it.
Do you have anything to eat?
Why does your couch have a hole in it
covered with duct tape?
And how have I not noticed it?
Because I...cover it with a pillow.
Joe Friday did it.
I'm lucky that Korsak found her owners
before she ate the entire couch.
Don't blame Addie.
It's not her fault that your couch tastes
like frank and beans.
My couch doesn't taste like frank --
Wait a minute. How do you know that Joe Friday's owner
has changed her name to Addie?
I skype with her family.
You skype... with her family?
Her real name was Addie before she got lost.
Okay, I think the more important question here is
why haven't you replaced your couch?
The dog's been gone over a year.
I like my couch. What is this?
Your couch has a hole in it
covered with duct tape.
It's an African horned cucumber.
Can you eat it?
Of course.
Tastes like a banana.
You need a new one.
Do you have one?
A new couch?
No. A banana.
I like my couch...
just the way it is. Rizzoli.
Isles.
Swatches.
I don't want a couch as a gift, Maura.
Think of it as a health issue.
The chemicals used to manufacture that cheap...
Easy.
...economical foam rubber
in your couch could pose a health risk.
Right now I'm worried about catching malaria.
Oh, don't be.
There hasn't been an outbreak of locally contracted malaria
since 1931,
although there have been recent outbreaks
of equine encephalitis.
Has not one of these mosquitos buzzed your head?
But -- you really aren't human, are you?
Well, some people have a genetic susceptibility to being bitten.
I don't.
Nice day for a hike in the woods, huh?
This -- this is why I don't go in the woods.
Hold out your hands.
You got enough for the whole body?
I got to bathe in this stuff.
What do we got?
White female. Probably a teenager.
We got a name?
No backpack. No pocketbook. No I.D.
But her clothes are new, so I don't think she's homeless.
This isn't a body dump.
Crate was camouflaged so it would blend in.
No sign of a struggle.
No blood spatter in the immediate area.
And there are no drag marks,
so she was carried here, but not in the cage.
Maybe she was attacked on the walking path?
No cameras at the entrance points.
We're checking the ones nearby.
Time of death?
Well, there are signs of lividity
but lack of rigor mortis.
I'd say less than five hours ago.
No obvious signs of injury or trauma
that would account for death.
Well, that looks like hair and blood.
Okay. I'll do a DNA test as soon as I get back.
Please find me something that belongs to the killer
so I can put him in a cage of his own.
What's with the spaceships?
Research for this astronomy course I'm taking.
We had this huge discussion the other night.
Let me guess -- UFOs and life on other planets.
Yes. And get this. This is crazy.
The government declassified
thousands of documents from a secret file
that dates back to 1947.
There's firsthand accounts of sightings...
When I was a kid...
...even stories of alien abductions
and human testing.
...I saw a UFO.
Clearly, they're delusional.
W--
Wait. What did you just say?
Nothing.
Well, I-I blurted.
Yeah, I blurt sometimes. It's a problem.
Hm. Hey, you want to, uh, talk about the case?
Do you have anything on the victim?
Nothing from missing persons or runaways...
...but these girls came up
on today's school department truancy report.
Let me see the third girl.
Did you get the picture of the victim yet?
I think it just came in.
That's her.
Sheila MacIntyre, 16 years old, from Roslindale.
I'm gonna tell Korsak.
He's gonna want to talk to the parents.
Take a look at these.
X-rays?
Fabric swatches?
Oh, just a few options for your new couch color.
My favorite couch color? Huh. Let me think.
The lavender.
No, no, no. Wait. Wait. Wait.
The cranberry.
Or the color of the couch I have now.
I'm trying to be a good friend.
Yes, I know.
But my couch is like an old, good friend,
And I wouldn't trade an old, good friend
for a...new, old, good friend.
Okay, you have a birthday coming up.
Wouldn't it be nice to just get something you really want?
I really want a cause of death.
What? What are you looking at?
Osteopenia.
It's a loss of calcium in the bones.
Well, she's a little young for that, isn't she?
In a person of her age,
it typically results from anorexia.
Well, that's not what killed her.
No, it didn't.
But I also found this...
A puncture wound from a small-gauge needle.
So she was injected with a fatal overdose.
Well, given the lack of restraint marks or bruising,
I'd say we're looking at a fast-acting drug
that could be administered intramuscularly.
So, she was drugged, carried back to the cage.
There's no indication of rape or other sexual assault.
What about the hair and blood
that we found inside the cage?
It was animal blood.
We're processing it for DNA now.
The hair fibers, however,
came from a raccoon, a dog, and a squirrel.
Is there any way to tell what order they went into the cage?
Several samples overlapped.
I think the squirrel came first, then the raccoon.
The dog was last.
A bigger animal each time.
He was practicing... getting ready for a human.
How the hell do you get through a day like this?
Right now they're on autopilot.
The worst day is coming -- the day the shock wears off
and they know their little girl is really gone.
What did you learn from Sheila's school?
Well, the guidance counselor says Sheila
was an all-around good kid --
Top of her class academically, no disciplinary issues.
She was a mentor to the incoming freshmen
and a peer counselor for the younger girls.
Maura found evidence of anorexia.
Mom and pop said she was treated for it
starting in her freshman year.
And it sounds like she was paying it forward.
What about boyfriend issues?
From what the guidance counselor told me,
these kids don't really date.
They do things as a group, kind of all hang out together.
You believe that?
I do.
Well, maybe one of them
knows about Sheila's movements that morning.
Two girlfriends walked with her as far as the bus stop.
Then they got on the 40 bus to Forest Hills,
and Sheila took her usual route
along the walking path to her school.
So now we know why she was in the woods.
Doesn't explain what she was doing in a damn cage.
Well, Nina submitted the case to ViCAP
for crimes with similar M.O.s.
Maybe we'll get lucky.
You look exhausted. Why don't you go home and rest?
Can't.
Not until I find something,
anything, that will move this case forward.
Well, I have a preliminary tox screen.
For real?
Negative for heroin, cocaine, and marijuana.
Great.
That leaves only 7 million other drugs
that could have been given to her.
On the bright side,
the full report should be ready tomorrow.
Okay.
Don't you just love this color?
Yes.
I love it.
It looks fantastic...
on you...
not a couch.
Well, I love it.
Your text said you had some info
on the company who made the cage?
Galen Containment Vessels.
They manufacture a wide range of animal cages...
from mice and rats to larger wildlife --
Wolves, coyotes, dogs, primates.
They supply over two dozen vendors...
who, in turn, sell them to laboratories,
game wardens, and, believe it or not,
pig farmers.
You know, I-I don't believe in any of that stuff.
Pig farming?
No.
Not pig farming. I don't care about pig farming.
I'm talking about UFOs.
I-I don't believe in it or care about it.
You know... I was just a kid.
It's stupid.
Really?
Yeah.
I mean, it was my imagination.
It was probably a blimp or a frisbee or...
All right, let me know when the list of vendors comes up.
But they're right...over there.
She's right in here.
Oh, thank you.
Maura.
Kevin Foley.
Please come in.
Thank you.
Hello.
Hi.
I-I'm -- I'm sorry to drop in without calling.
Not at all. It's really nice to see you.
I was just making some coffee. Would you like to join me?
Oh, uh, no, no, uh...
Uh, thank you.
Please.
Chief medical examiner.
So...interdisciplinary.
I could never do what you do.
Oh. You've always been very modest.
I read the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry,
and your innovations and applications
on narrative therapy are very impressive.
Thank you.
So, what brings you by?
I was reading the Boston Dispatch.
I-I know it's available online,
uh, but I just can't let go of the physical paper.
Oh, I know how you feel.
Th-there was a, um --
a photo of you at the scene of a murder.
Kevin?
The photo -- it -- it -- it made me, um...
I wanted to...
well, I wanted to ask you --
Oh, that poor girl.
She wasn't assaulted in any way, was she?
I can't discuss an open investigation with you.
Yes, of course. Of course not.
C-could you tell me if, um...
do you have a suspect?
Why do you want to know?
Kevin, if you know anything --
I've made a terrible mistake by coming here like this.
I -- - No, not at all.
I-I can't do this.
I'm sorry.
I-I-it was lovely to -- to see you, Maura.
Okay, Maura, thanks.
What's up?
Get this --
A friend of Maura's from med school just dropped in on her --
guy she hasn't seen in a decade --
a psychiatrist named Dr. Kevin Foley.
I have a feeling it wasn't a social visit.
No. She said he was real nervous.
Then he started asking questions
about Sheila MacIntyre.
Then he asked if she was assaulted
and if we had a suspect.
He has information about our case,
but he can't violate doctor/patient confidentiality.
No, but he would have known that before he left the office.
Then why bother coming?
Maybe he's not asking because of a client.
Maybe it's 'cause he's never killed anyone before
and now he's nervous, so he decides to trick
an old friend into telling him if he's about to get caught.
Dr. Foley?
Detective Jane Rizzoli -- Boston Homicide.
Dr. Isles told you about my visit.
I have nothing to say.
Well, then, why'd you go see her?
Even if I wanted to, I can't help you.
Listen, clearly something is on your conscience, all right?
Please talk to me.
I can't. Please leave me alone.
Did you kill Sheila MacIntyre?
Me?
No, of course not.
No?
Your little animal study at BCU
giving you a taste for killing things?
What? No, you can't --
None of those animals were ever hurt.
It was a study on the effects of companion animals.
I could never hurt that girl.
But you know who did, don't you?
She was 16 years old, and she was stuffed into a cage.
That's a pretty horrible way to die, don't you think?
Look, if you didn't want to help,
you wouldn't have gone to Maura, okay?
I can promise you
Sheila MacIntyre will not be the last person to die.
I need to get to my office.
You need to do the right thing, doctor.
So, Foley was telling the truth
about his animal studies at BCU.
So the killer must be one of Foley's patients.
He wants to tell us, but he can't.
I hate to state the obvious, but no judge is gonna give us
a warrant to go digging through Foley's patients' records.
And the surveillance won't help us, either.
Too many other businesses in the building
to be sure who's going in to see Foley.
You guys aren't helping.
Okay, the tox report says she was administered
a fatal dose of tiletamine and zolazepam.
Those are euthanizing agents used by veterinarians.
Wait a minute. We can do an end run.
If you check with the D.E.A.,
see who has access to those drugs,
I can subpoena Foley's billing records
to the insurance companies.
Then Frankie can cross-reference
the names we get from the D.E.A. with the billing records.
Yeah.
And if Foley is treating anyone on the D.E.A. List,
that might be enough for a judge to sign a warrant.
I'll get on it
right after I cancel the plans I had
for the rest of my life.
We need a new angle on this.
A full profile is impossible.
There's only one data point.
No, there's two.
He killed someone,
and he's probably one of Foley's patients.
Still.
Maura, please.
Anything that you got is more than what I've got.
The subject is a male. He's an immature killer.
So Sheila was probably his first kill.
Yes. He's intelligent and organized.
He obtained a cage. He picked a hiding spot.
He acquired the drugs necessary to carry out his plan,
and he selected a victim.
Does the cage suggest some sort of need
for domination or something?
No. I think it's for the ritual.
The drugs he used have a side effect.
When animals are injected with it,
their eyes have to be taped shut or they stay open.
It's not a cage. It's a holding pen.
He just stood there and watched the life drain out of her eyes.
Quite possibly.
No wonder Foley got the heebie-jeebies.
That's really all I can say.
You sure?
Yes.
Really? Nothing?
You don't want to, like, ask me something about a couch,
maybe pitch a color or a texture or...
Curly something?
No.
Hey, mom. What's up?
Yeah, okay. I'll be right there.
See you later.
Hi, mom. What's up?
Hi. I was worried about you.
You need to eat something.
And these are your favorites.
These are not my favorite.
These are not even napkins. They're fabric swatch--
Ma,
I can't believe you called me in to do this right now.
Come on. Maura wants to do something nice for you.
Fine.
I've made a decision.
Toasted walnut pearl?
Corinthian coral?
I like my couch.
That's my decision, okay?
I don't want a gift couch with obligations.
Maura's not giving you a gift
with obligations attached to it.
Really?
Are you calling her?
Of course.
Hi, Jane.
Um, question --
what would you do if I dropped a piece of pizza
on this gift couch you were gonna give me?
Well, that's not even a challenge.
I'd take a bit of baking soda.
I would sprinkle it on the stain.
I'd make sure the stain was completely covered.
Then you allow the baking soda to absorb the grease
from the upholstery for 15 to 20 minutes.
Okay, that's 15 to 20 too long.
I have a three-step process.
I would pick up the pizza, I would eat the pizza,
and then I would dab the spot with a paper towel.
But that's unsanitary.
Especially if you drop food on a regular basis.
I like my couch.
No new couch.
I got to go.
Rizzoli.
Uh, yes, Dr. Foley. 3:15 would be fine.
Thank you.
These are all disgusting.
We don't want to disturb Dr. Foley if he's with a client,
but he did ask us to be here at 3:15.
I don't see anything entered into his calendar for this afternoon,
but sometimes doctors forget to enter their last-minute appointments.
Dr. Foley?
That's odd.
If the red light is on,
he should be in there with a client.
Um, would you mind stepping over here for a second, please?
Dr. Foley?
He's dead.
Please don't hurt me.
He tell you what happened?
No. All I got was his name -- Daniel O'Neill --
His age -- 16 years --
and a request to call his parents.
Paramedics clear him for travel?
Yeah. Couple of uniforms are taking him down to H.Q.
Foley told us to be here at 3:15 --
while Daniel was still here.
Wanted us to get a look at the kid,
see if we could figure out his connection to the murder?
He had to have told Daniel that we were coming.
I bet he wanted Daniel to turn himself in.
Well, that didn't work out as planned.
Panic button.
You can hear that all the way down the hall.
Well, it only works if you can get to it.
The blood spatter on his clothes
places Daniel directly in front of Dr. Foley
when he was stabbed.
So, Daniel killed him.
I can't say that.
Did you ever play "Clue"?
Two people in a room. One person's dead.
The other person's covered in blood. Who's the murderer?
Well, I think it's the person
that left their fingerprints on the murder weapon.
You know, about that UFO stuff --
I'm not surprised you saw a ufo when you were a kid.
You're not? Why?
There have been 13 recorded ufo sightings in Boston
in the last two years alone.
I don't know.
I'm telling you.
What? You don't know what?
I was just asking Frankie if the restaurant
at the top of the Prudential Center really turns around.
It doesn't.
What do we know about Daniel?
He's been homeschooled since the 5th grade,
but he finished in the top 1% of his high-school class
on the district's standardized tests.
When did he start seeing Dr. Foley?
About six months ago.
All right, call me if you get anything else.
Sure thing.
Prints on the letter opener are Daniel's.
Let's see what he has to say about that.
Thank you.
I never should have let you talk me into taking him there.
You went along with it. You knew --
There is absolutely nothing wrong with him.
Boys will be boys.
Mr. And Mrs. O'Neill, I'm Detective Jane Rizzoli.
Obviously, we understand how hard this is
for all of you, Daniel especially.
I don't want to talk about it.
I can understand that, but I think it's important
that you tell us what happened today.
Anything to tie this kid to the MacIntyre murder?
Not yet, Ernie.
But we've got plenty of evidence
that makes him good for Foley's murder,
including his fingerprints on the murder weapon.
I don't know what you expect him to say.
The truth.
Witnessing something like he did...
he's supposed to get over that?
Daniel, why don't you
tell your parents what really happened today.
What the hell are you talking about? What are you saying?
The physical evidence proves
that it was Daniel who stabbed Dr. Foley.
Daniel, what were you and Dr. Foley talking about recently?
I don't know.
Stuff.
Why were you in Dr. Foley's office today?
Just a regular appointment.
Your regular appointments are on Thursdays.
He...
he asked me to come in.
Did he say why?
Daniel.
Why were you in Dr. Foley's office today?
He was molesting me, and I was gonna tell.
He's lying.
You got any proof of that?
No.
Look, I'm not saying Daniel didn't kill Dr. Foley,
but look at him.
Right now, a jury is gonna see that kid,
a kid who was defending himself against a sexual predator.
He's not going forward with this.
That little shit killed Sheila MacIntyre.
I know it.
But you can't prove it.
No, but Dr. Foley could.
And he was gonna turn him over to us.
Get a subpoena for his records.
Nothing that kid says to his psychiatrist
will see the light of day in a courtroom.
No, but he just opened that door for us
by accusing Foley of molesting him.
That might work.
You should have gone to law school.
We can hold him?
Yes, when the records tie him to the MacIntyre girl's murder.
Until then, Foley's death is self-defense.
Daniel O'Neill gets released to his parents.
Six months of therapy -- there's not a single note
about murder, violence, or anger towards women.
What the hell was Dr. Foley so worried about?
I got your message.
What do you need?
Pretzels.
From your vending machine.
I...
Well, you didn't say --
D-do you really want pretzels?
No.
I really want to know
why Daniel O'Neill's therapy file is so unhelpful.
Well, you knew Dr. Foley.
A long time ago.
Okay, well, did he have some weird note-taking system, then?
I mean, we've looked for audio files, iClouds,
receipts for off-site storage.
These are session notes.
Yes.
So, where are Daniel's narratives?
Narratives?
Foley practiced narrative therapy.
The client writes or talks about his life
as it is or as he wishes it would be.
So, I would expect to see at least one of those in the file.
Well, we didn't get anything like that from Mrs. Lewis.
She didn't strike me as someone who would misplace files.
No.
Daniel took them.
Well, they weren't on him after the murder.
I searched all of his clothes.
They weren't in Dr. Foley's desk.
What if he put them in the other patients' files?
He knows we can't get in there. That's client confidentiality.
I'll see if I can convince Mrs. Lewis to look through everything.
Interesting.
Daniel's only real passion was volunteering
at the Composer Hill Animal Shelter.
That's a perfect place for him to have access
to the drugs and the cage.
I think I need to adopt a new dog.
I've complied with the subpoena.
You have everything in the O'Neill boy's file.
I know, but it appears as though some pages might be missing --
The narratives?
I'm sorry, sergeant.
I don't know anything about that.
Well, what if they were accidentally misfiled by Dr. Foley?
Or intentionally misfiled by Daniel O'neill?
That would be highly unlikely.
But what if he did...
And all those files were lost when they were sent
to the new doctors taking over all of Dr. Foley's patients?
And I know you want everything to be in order when it goes.
Sergeant, I don't think this is a good time to do this --
We think Daniel O'neill murdered this girl.
She was 16 years old.
Poor child.
She looks familiar.
I certainly wouldn't want any of these files
to leave here incomplete.
Take a seat. This may take a while.
You needed to see me?
Holy shit.
What?
Why would you do that?
Do what?
Sneak in here like some kind of ninja.
Oh, that wasn't sneaking.
Watch this. Ninja.
I am a ninja!
Okay, okay, now I'm afraid you're gonna fall.
No. I'm okay.
Nice "wounded goose," though.
It was pretty good.
So, did you need to see me?
Yes.
Okay.
Uh, wait a sec.
What do you got there?
For me?
What's the occasion?
No occasion. I saw it, and I thought of you.
All right.
This is beautiful.
Wait. Am I being punked?
What is -- the keys to my spaceship?
Nope. Just for the roof.
You can put the telescope up there --
You know, keep an eye out.
Worst case, you get to see a beautiful moon
every now and then.
Do you believe there's life up there?
I believe that anything is possible.
What are you doing here, Daniel?
I'm out for a ride.
I'm not doing anything.
I-I know where you've been today.
My friends at the shelter told me
some bitch cop was around asking about me.
Yeah, they miss you there.
Nobody could figure out why you quit.
They said you were so good with the animals...
so ready to be there with them at their final moment.
But we know why you quit, don't we?
They don't kill dogs there anymore.
There's no thrills for you.
Why are you picking on me, Jane?
I'm just a kid.
I'm gonna make sure you never hurt anybody ever again.
Good luck with that.
There were 15 Daniel O'neill narratives
all stuck in with other patients' files.
So...
We're looking for the serial killer/psychopath checklist, huh?
Fire, torture.
Voyeurism, antisocial behavior.
I wonder how long it took his mother to realize
there was something really wrong with him.
Well, for most parents, I think there's
a significant degree of denial that has to be overcome,
as well as the guilt about having your child be such a person.
I can't imagine.
"Fire is alive.
I love to watch it breathe, jump around, dance.
It consumes everything that falls into it,
that I put into it.
It ripples and twists like it's trying to escape."
He did it.
"I'll take her to the woods. There's a quiet place I know.
She can rest there safe and secure, untouched.
I want to help her sleep. I know how to do that.
I'll watch over her until I'm sure she's gone."
All the elements of Sheila's murder --
cage in the woods,
lack of sexual assault, drugs.
This must be the narrative that made Foley come to see me.
The narratives aren't enough
to charge O'neill with Sheila's murder.
A lawyer will just claim
he was coerced to write these stories.
Yeah. Without Dr. Foley to give us therapeutic context,
they're useless in court.
We might be able to use them for a competence hearing.
裁定被告人能否理解罪名并与律师合作准备辩护
Well, between the narratives and the session notes
and what I learned at the animal clinic,
it might be enough to get him committed.
He's a minor -- and smart.
When he turns 18, how much do you want to bet
he convinces everyone that he's cured?
God, I wish you could have seen
his smug little face in the parking garage.
Foley diagnosed him as a high-functioning narcissist.
He thinks he's smarter than we are.
Well, he's not.
Hey, detective.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Sure.
You knew that there was a problem with Daniel
for quite some time.
Was that why you sent him to see Dr. Foley?
You know, sending him to see Dr. Foley is the best thing
that you could have done for him.
You knew that he had hurt someone,
and I can imagine that was very difficult for you.
Please help us.
Mrs. O'neill, you can have Daniel committed
to a psychiatric hospital, where he will never,
ever be able to hurt anyone else again.
Please.
I know this is difficult.
Please help us.
Okay.
I'll help you.
Okay.
Let's go.
We need to go to my office.
I have some paperwork to do,
and then we'll go straight to the D.A.'s office, okay?
Here you go.
Thank you.
Mrs. O'neill, I-I'm so sorry.
I left the paperwork upstairs, okay?
Just -- just lock the door, and I'll be right back, okay?
Damn it.
Hi, mom!
Open the door, mom, please.
I just want to talk to you for a minute.
You move, you die.
Please. I'm -- I'm just a kid.
So was Sheila Macintyre.
Yes.
Thank you.
Mrs. Lewis was right.
Sheila Macintyre was familiar.
She was a patient of another doctor
in Foley's medical suite with a Thursday appointment.
How did we miss that?
We didn't.
That doctor moved his practice four months ago.
That's why Mrs. Lewis recognized the photograph
but didn't remember her name.
So, Sheila spent two months in a waiting room with Daniel.
She probably told him everything about herself.
Why did he pick her?
Because she fit in the cage.
Well, the lab confirmed --
it was tiletamine and zolazepam in Daniel's syringe.
We also found traces of blood on the needle.
It's been processed for a DNA match to Sheila Macintyre.
Oh, Ernie in the D.A.'s office is gonna love this case.
It's all wrapped up with a bow on top.
Speaking of gift-wrapped --
Jane, I have a little surprise for you.
You didn't.
I did.
Granted, I had to oil a few hands and tug a few lines...
No.
She means she grease a few palms and pull a few strings.
...but your new, plain-old-brown,
no-holes, scotchgarded couch is being delivered tonight.
But I don't want a new couch.
Well, it's too late. It's already on its way.
So, happy early birthday.
Thank you.
Rizzoli.
What?
Yeah, I'm -- I'm on my way.
Uh, I got to go.
Um, my apartment building is on fire.
Angela.
Where's Jane?
She ran out before we did. She's got to be here by now.
Jane?! Oh. Jane!
Ma, be careful.
What?
Oh, Jane.
Ohh, honey. I'm so sorry.
I'm really sorry, detective.
How bad?
It's a total loss.
Coming through.
Any of you guys know a Rizzoli?
We couldn't get the truck down the street.
Really?
You're welcome?
Sorry.
All right.
I'm sorry.
It's a nice couch.
I'm sorry.
That's a fine-looking couch.
Yeah, look at this. It's beautiful.
The fabric is amazing.
All righty.
Yeah, I can sleep on it right here.
