i understand there are some questions
about my opponent &apos;s hiring and promotion practices
over at the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office .
i don &apos;t intend to speak to that .
but i do think diversity is a fair ...
&quot; but i do think diversity ... &quot;
a little under the weather ?
oh , just a little .
you needed me ?
yes , how &apos;s it feel to be an equity partner ?
good .
the power surging through you ?
something &apos;s surging through me .
so the , um , bishop defense .
i was looking over the billable hours .
they &apos;re coming in a bit high .
that &apos;s usually not a problem ,
but bishop is a top legacy client .
we don &apos;t want him to think we &apos;re padding him .
so , i need you to rein it in .
um , that &apos;s cary &apos;s team .
do you want me to get him ?
no . that &apos;s your team .
you &apos;re the equity partner in charge ,
as of now .
right , i will get right on that .
just find out if the hours are being inflated .
and if they &apos;re not ,
steer the group onto a more conservative path .
what &apos;s up ?
oh , i need to head out this afternoon .
i was hoping you could look over the civil proposal .
there &apos;s another cold .
you two need to stay away from me .
um , do you need anything else , diane ?
no , thank you .
hi .
i was thrilled to get your call .
this is a working lunch .
i know .
but i was thrilled .
your wiretap has been thrown out , mr. perrotti .
uh , josh .
your wiretap has been found inadmissible , josh .
you have nothing on my client
so we ask the department of justice
to cease and desist from harassing eli gold .
i ordered for us .
i hope that wasn &apos;t presumptuous .
well , i &apos;m not that hungry .
you were saying ?
i was ? what was i ... ? oh .
here you are in petra moritz &apos;s column .
&quot; is florrick strategist , eli gold , off the hook yet ?
&quot; not according to a conversation
&quot; overheard at parrillan
between a certain unnamed source
and ausa josh perrotti . &quot;
well , they misspelled my name .
&quot; i know personally eli gold was buying votes .
he &apos;s going down ; he &apos;s going down hard &quot;
so , josh , are we on a witch hunt ?
the problem is , elsbeth ,
you and i are a lot alike .
we &apos;re competitive .
onion naan ?
no , thank you .
and i know eli is guilty .
so ,
i found another way to prove the charge .
conspiracy .
really ?
well , conspiracy requires a coconspirator .
and who might that be ?
this unnamed source at parrillan ?
that &apos;s for me to know and you to find out .
no , that &apos;s for me to know , too .
discovery .
then take me to court .
you want me to take you to court ?
i can &apos;t wait for you to take me to court .
i love the shape of your lips .
you leave my lips out of it .
i can &apos;t . they &apos;re so pillowy .
look ...
all you have to do is go to prison once
on a false corruption charge ,
and you &apos;re going to take it very , very seriously .
thank you , mr. florrick .
miss hayward , you have two minutes to respond .
i don &apos;t need two minutes to respond .
i just need two words : &quot; eli gold . &quot;
peter &apos;s own campaign manager
is accused of corruption ...
uh , he is no longer my campaign manager .
eli gold has resigned .
yes , but you can understand
why i should take your intolerance
for corruption with a grain of salt .
well , unlike miss hayward ,
i like to get all the facts before i make a judgement .
but you said that eli gold is off of your campaign .
no , i said he resigned .
so you do accept corruption or you would &apos;ve fired him .
what i don &apos;t accept are having my words
twisted into something
uh , peter .
peter . peter .
which is not what i ...
let &apos;s take ten .
peter .
here &apos;s the thing :
you &apos;re tall .
and you &apos;re much taller than the actual maddie .
so , when you go after her like that ,
it looks like you &apos;re bullying .
should i crouch ?
no , she &apos;s the one down in the polls .
make her look desperate .
keep your words calm , noncombative .
don &apos;t go aggressive .
you know , absorb the punches .
like obama , in his first debate .
no , this is different .
this is about the women &apos;s vote .
you go angry , you &apos;re going to remind women
of their first husbands .
excuse me . yeah .
i hope that was all right .
no , that &apos;s why you &apos;re here .
don &apos;t let up on me , because she won &apos;t .
by the way , thanks for doing this .
oh , my pleasure .
so , i hear the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office
is looking for a new outside firm
to represent it on its civil suits .
you heard about brandelsky &amp; turner going bankrupt ?
yeah , that seems to be happening a lot .
i know we were allowed to pitch the first time around .
i hope we &apos;re allowed to pitch the second .
well , unfortunately , it &apos;s not up to me .
i &apos;ve put together a team of asas to interview .
but , you know what ?
i &apos;m going to ... i &apos;m going to tell them that you &apos;re interested .
thank you . that &apos;d be great .
once more into the fray ?
oh , you &apos;re going down .
oh , we &apos;ll see .
how &apos;re you going to do this ?
do what ?
find out who this coconspirator is ?
i don &apos;t know .
you don &apos;t know ?
don &apos;t you have a plan ?
i don &apos;t plan .
you &apos;re a crazy woman .
reservation ?
hello .
i &apos;m mr. joshua perrotti &apos;s personal assistant ,
and he came in here yesterday for lunch .
he was supposed to give his number
to his waitperson regarding a personal matter .
but he doesn &apos;t remember the name of his waitperson .
um , is there @-@ is there any way
you could find out who served him ?
he was here for lunch ?
12 : 30 , 1 : 00 reservation .
perrotti , perrotti .
i don &apos;t see it .
do you know who he was having lunch with ?
may i take a peak ?
frank landau of the dnc .
you turned on me ?
what ?
you went to the feds ?
what do you want , eli ?
they &apos;re using you to get to me .
who said that ?
you got yourself printed up in petra moritz
saying i paid for votes .
they &apos;re coming after me , eli .
so you threw me to them ?
my head and my career were on the chopping block .
you &apos;d do the same .
what do they have , frank , huh ?
what did you give them ?
you got to calm down , eli .
they &apos;re coming after me .
you calm the hell down .
i don &apos;t know you .
anything i did wrong was at your prompting , frank .
i don &apos;t know you , and this encounter never happened .
i will find a way to bring you down .
i &apos;m going into my office ,
and i &apos;m not listening to another word being said .
so all our attempts at bail have failed .
lemond bishop is still considered a flight risk .
we have three briefs ready for pretrial hearings .
hello , alicia .
alicia &apos;s recently been named equity partner .
let &apos;s give her a hand .
thank you .
okay , so , we &apos;re good to go on all three briefs .
everyone should pull on
four or five more associates to get those ready ...
actually ...
yes ?
2 申请变更审判地
do we really need all three ?
the jurisdictional brief ,
it seems like ...
well , it seems the same as brief number two .
well , last time we were together ,
we all thought that was a good idea .
yes , and i &apos;m wondering now if it &apos;s a doubling of effort .
well , let &apos;s vote again .
who thinks we should pull back on the jurisdictional brief ?
just raise your hands .
maybe it &apos;s not about dropping the brief .
is there any way we could be more conservative
in our approach to it ?
sure .
do you want to take charge of that ?
okay , sure .
he &apos;s playing keep @-@ away .
we are not withholding .
due course passed a long time ago .
we are following the law .
no , no , no , that is not ...
that is right , we have complied with every request ...
they clearly haven &apos;t complied with every request
or i wouldn &apos;t be ...
stop .
let us stop , please .
mr. perrotti , this is not justice by ambush .
we must offer the defense discovery here .
once we have it , your honor .
but any premature release may damage our case .
how would it damage your case ?
counselor , please .
by allowing the defense
to dissuade our witnesses from testifying .
excuse me , when did we ...
mr. perrotti ,
do you have any reason for this charge ?
we have , your honor .
we &apos;d like to call mr. frank landau to the stand .
and you were a witness to eli gold purchasing votes ?
yes .
and you conspired with him ?
yes .
and you had a pang of conscience and you came to me ?
yes .
hmm , and what happened yesterday ?
eli gold discovered that i was going to accuse him .
he showed up at my office .
he was violent and disruptive .
did you fear he might hurt you ?
yes , he knocked my keys from my hand .
oh , my god , he knocked away your keys ?
counselor , please .
your honor , the point is clear .
defense can &apos;t be trusted with discovery ,
not at such an early stage , anyway .
okay , that was my mistake .
what does landau have on you , eli ?
i don &apos;t know , there &apos;s nothing .
no scheme to buy votes ?
no , and if he says there was , he is lying .
well , they need some kind of corroboration to convict you .
so we need to know what he &apos;s going to say .
and how do we do that ?
i don &apos;t know .
we have to think .
yes ?
what ?
you just had a thought .
i think i did .
hello .
the real estate office is two doors down .
is this the democratic headquarters ?
yeah .
and you &apos;re frank landau ?
yeah , why ?
you &apos;ve been served .
oh , hell .
what for ?
defamation .
are you kidding me ?
i &apos;m just the messenger .
damn it , eli .
so , i hear you want our business .
i want your business ?
the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s business , our civil suits ?
oh , yes , are you on the committee ?
don &apos;t sound so surprised .
that wasn &apos;t surprise , it was awe .
here &apos;s our application-- please fill it out .
we &apos;re starting to hear pitches this afternoon .
aw , poor boy , you have a cold .
ah , getting over it .
and we &apos;ll be judged fairly ?
why wouldn &apos;t you be ?
i don &apos;t know , we won a few cases against you .
oh , yes , well , we &apos;ll just have to overcome
our bitterness at your one @-@ case winning streak .
alicia , good , there you are .
do you have a minute ?
i do .
um , i need some help with the eli gold case .
actually i don &apos;t think we can help you in federal court .
yes-- oh , no , not that ; this is in civil court .
civil court-- how did this end up in civil court ?
well , it &apos;s in both courts , actually .
it &apos;s not as confusing as it sounds .
we &apos;re suing the-- ooh , i like those earrings .
thanks . so ...
we &apos;re suing the head of the democratic committee for defamation .
why ?
he said some nasty things about eli in a gossip column .
okay , i don &apos;t understand the connection .
you know how hard it is to win in defamation .
yes , we don &apos;t want to win .
you don &apos;t ?
no , we want the defense to ask for a dismissal .
then we &apos;ll be able to put
frank landau on the stand in civil court
to find out what he intends to say
against eli in federal court .
it &apos;s not as strange as it sounds .
really ?
you &apos;re funny .
so you &apos;ll help us ?
you want me to playact a lawyer
in your sham defamation lawsuit ?
pretty much , yes .
this is not a sham , your honor .
we take the defamation of our client very seriously .
their motive is so nakedly obvious ,
your honor , it &apos;s almost comical .
there is nothing comical about the ruining of our client &apos;s ...
we strenuously insist that this case be dismissed with prejudice .
i can hear perfectly .
nobody needs to yell .
counselor , i &apos;ve read the petitions .
this is third @-@ party defamation ?
exactly-- mr. landau didn &apos;t print this comment .
he didn &apos;t scream it from the rooftops .
yes , because he didn &apos;t have to .
he was in a public place-- parrillan--
and he should have known his comments could be easily overheard .
she &apos;s right , counselor .
third @-@ party public declaration is still defamatory .
are you arguing for a dismissal ?
yes , your honor ,
we move for a dismissal with prejudice .
no .
excuse me , sir , do you have business here ?
i seem to now .
you don &apos;t want a dismissal .
your honor , the plaintiff asks
to present witnesses against this motion .
okay , what &apos;s going on ?
mr. perrotti is a department of justice lawyer ...
... who wants to use this defamation suit
to fuel his prosecution of our client .
wait a minute , just the opposite .
you &apos;re with the department of justice ?
i am , your honor .
good , well , then , shut up .
present your witnesses , counselor .
we call mr. frank landau to the stand .
damn it .
what ?
did you say the following , sir ?
&quot; i know personally eli gold was buying votes . &quot;
i did .
and you still insist this was not defamatory ?
i do .
and why is that ?
it &apos;s true .
really ?
and how do you know it &apos;s true ?
your honor ,
this testimony will seriously undermine
a current department of justice investigation .
we ask that it be delayed .
mr. perrotti ...
ausa perrotti .
yes .
you have no standing in this court ,
and furthermore i don &apos;t like the department of justice ,
so please sit down and stop interrupting .
again , mr. landau , how do you know
this statement to be true ?
i arranged the meeting for eli to buy votes .
any ideas ?
and with who did you arrange this meeting ?
you must answer , mr. landau .
the meeting was with hugh saxon .
and what is mr. saxon &apos;s job description ?
he &apos;s ceo of greengate retirement centers .
are you crazy ?
that wasn &apos;t to buy votes .
mr. gold , stop .
and you witnessed this meeting
between mr. saxon and mr. gold ?
yes .
mr. florrick &apos;s mother was to speak
at one of his convalescent homes .
and in what way were these votes bought ?
mr. gold was worried
that he wouldn &apos;t get enough votes to make
a strong enough showing at the democratic straw poll ,
so mr. saxon promised to bus 600 senior citizens
to the straw poll
to pack the vote for peter florrick--
your husband .
alicia , do you mind giving us a moment ?
i do , actually .
this has nothing to do with peter .
you packed the vote ?
i did what everyone does , i ...
wait a minute .
no , alicia ,
you may be subject to subpoena in federal court .
no , i enjoy attorney @-@ client privilege .
only if you have no previous knowledge of this
as the wife of the candidate .
peter doesn &apos;t know you packed the straw poll ?
i didn &apos;t pack it .
it was a democratic outreach to involve seniors in the process .
in trade for a discount
on greengate &apos;s crisis management ?
not in trade .
coincidentally , at the same time .
that &apos;s all .
you didn &apos;t rein in your hours , alicia .
we &apos;re still working on it .
well , there are more associates involved
in the bishop case than before .
you need to assert your authority .
i &apos;ve gone over the work , diane , it &apos;s all necessary .
part of asserting my authority is telling you that .
well , here &apos;s another part .
find a way to cut ten percent of their billable hours .
it &apos;s all right .
you over your cold ?
yes .
you ?
getting there .
alicia , it &apos;s okay .
we &apos;re not gonna act on it .
again .
yes , again .
it was a mistake , it happened , but that &apos;s it .
we can &apos;t ... avoid each other .
you &apos;re right .
i &apos;ll see you around .
see you .
yes , i met with eli gold .
you &apos;re with his defense team ?
i am .
the prosecution says that you met with mr. gold
for the purposes of voter fraud .
i have an agreement with the department of justice
which prevents me from going into these matters .
yeah , is that regarding arranging transport
for seniors staying in your homes ?
again , i really can &apos;t say .
all right , then , let me just say this .
i think that the department of justice
is trying to scare you ...
this , um , this picture ,
this one here ... is that taken from the straw poll ?
yes .
do you have any more from that day ?
we probably do .
why ?
hey , do you want to have dinner tonight ?
what ?
do you want to have dinner tonight ?
why ?
what do you mean , why ?
no , i mean , who with ?
oh , no , not the campaign , just us .
what ?
a date ?
no , not a date ,
uh ... just ...
okay , a date .
okay .
good .
you know that jordan says that if maddie attacks me
in tomorrow &apos;s debate , that i should back off
so that i don &apos;t look like a bully .
you think that &apos;s smart ?
i think you should call eli and ask him .
i haven &apos;t , uh , been talking to eli .
i know .
i think you should call eli .
we book over $ 55 million in yearly client fees
and we do this by providing individualized service .
the primary reason we &apos;re one of the few large firms
left standing is because we don &apos;t forget
it &apos;s all about the client .
now , i was told ten minutes ,
but i could go on for another 30 .
you have any questions ?
no , this is great .
good presentation .
thank you .
actually i have a question .
ms. hellinger .
you represent the drug dealer lemond bishop , don &apos;t you ?
i don &apos;t think we need to go into that .
won &apos;t that prove difficult ,
representing chicago &apos;s top drug dealer
while at the same time representing us ?
obviously there &apos;s always a chinese wall
between the service i would supply for you and the service
others in our firm would supply for mr. bishop .
thank you , very helpful .
that &apos;s it , a chinese wall ?
well , if we had to make other adjustments , we &apos;d be willing .
okay , thank you .
have you seen these photos before , mr. saxon ?
yes , i took them .
and could you tell this court
what event is documented in these photos ?
yes , the democratic straw poll four months ago .
and you arranged transportation
for the seniors pictured here to be at this straw poll ?
yes .
now , the prosecution ,
in the form of the formidable mr. perrotti--
he has suggested that this was
an attempt to stack the deck in favor of mr. florrick
at this poll . is that true ?
no .
uh , as you can see , the seniors involved voted
for all three of the candidates .
you &apos;re referring to their t @-@ shirts ?
the shirts represented which candidates they support ?
yes .
only a third of the seniors voted for mr. florrick .
objection-- we don &apos;t know how they voted .
we just know what color shirts they wore .
that is true as far as it goes .
now , the prosecution ... josh perrotti--
also has presented a witness .
this witness-- mr. landau--
claims that you had a deal :
that mr. gold discounted his services
in trade for this transport of seniors .
that is untrue .
your honor , mr. landau &apos;s testimony
swearing to this supposed conversation isn &apos;t enough .
he needs corroboration .
mr. saxon was that corroboration ,
and as you can see ,
mr. saxon insists that conversation never took place .
yes , mr. perrotti ,
we are prone to dismiss this suit .
actually , your honor ,
mr. saxon was not the only eyewitness .
really , who else ?
a witness i will make available tomorrow , your honor .
my father used to have dinner with him
every night-- well , not every night .
mrs. florrick ?
yes , hello . do i know you ?
no , you don &apos;t , but you look exactly like my grandmother .
really ?
yes , and i &apos;m sorry to say this , but you &apos;ve been served .
yeah , yeah , i agree .
all right , well , hang in there .
no , i &apos;ll be fine .
we &apos;ll talk later .
hey , i &apos;m ready .
let me have it .
have what ?
your phone .
are you feeling threatened ?
no .
no , but i do know that there can only be one captain .
eli will tell you the same thing .
the surest way to screw up a campaign
is to listen to two captains .
do you trust me ?
yeah .
then , give me your phone .
i trust you , but i like my phone .
peter ... you can &apos;t call eli .
okay .
is this a courting , a stalking or a ...
casual drop @-@ by ?
what am i missing ?
what are you missing ?
with the pitch .
you were a little north of hostile .
you &apos;re joking , right ?
was this just to show me up ,
bring me into the pitch so you can cut me off at the knees
in front of geneva pine ?
yep , that &apos;s me .
well , thanks a lot .
are you really this dense ?
i got the message .
geneva pine was against you .
she wasn &apos;t against me until you started asking your questions .
she was being polite .
that &apos;s why i was asking the hard questions .
she doesn &apos;t want lockhart @-@ gardner
because you represent a drug dealer .
that &apos;s why i was asking--
i was giving you a chance .
but thanks for your understanding .
hello , jackie .
i don &apos;t think we should be talking , mr. gold .
jackie , i need to know if you &apos;re gonna ...
what you &apos;re gonna say .
i &apos;m going to tell the truth , mr. gold .
alicia , i could use your help .
yes . i am on my way right now .
mm @-@ hmm . bye .
got a second ?
no .
got the revised billing statement on the bishop case .
you cut my hours ?
it &apos;s coming from the top .
forgive me , but aren &apos;t you also a partner on this case ?
let &apos;s talk about this later , cary .
alicia , you cut my billables ,
it screws me come promotion time ,
and i prefer not to have the rug
yanked out from under me a second time .
right now let &apos;s just focus on winning for bishop .
jacqueline florrick .
you &apos;re the mother of current
cook county state &apos;s attorney peter florrick ?
and future illinois governor
peter florrick , yes .
mm . mrs. florrick ,
on october 18 , 2012,
did you give a speech in support of your son &apos;s campaign
to the residents of the greengate retirement center
in northbrook ?
yes .
was eli gold also present ?
yes .
he arranged for me to speak there .
i &apos;m sure he wanted to ensure i stayed on point .
at the reception afterwards ,
did you talk with mr. gold
and greengate ceo hugh saxon ?
why , yes .
and what was discussed ?
arthritis .
i don &apos;t mean to be funny .
the facility was offering wonderful new therapy ...
was anything else discussed , mrs. florrick ?
well ... jewish stuff .
&quot; jewish stuff &quot; &quot;
and @-@ and what is &quot; jewish stuff &quot; ?
mm , the sabbath and @-@ and a seder .
a seder is a dinner .
she &apos;s doing this to get back at me .
for what ?
for everything .
was anything of a political nature discussed ?
actually , much of a political nature was discussed ,
but mr. gold doesn &apos;t like it when i discuss politics ,
so often i just listen .
when you were listening , did you hear
mr. gold and mr. saxon agree on a deal ?
i don &apos;t know if i would call it a deal .
they had an agreement .
did mr. gold agree to cut his crisis @-@ management fee
in return for mr. saxon transporting greengate residents
to the cook county straw poll
to vote for your son ?
that sounds about right .
we need to poke a hole in what she heard .
we could impeach her as a witness .
how ?
well , jackie had a stroke last year .
she &apos;s had problem with her memory and orientation .
that &apos;s right . exactly !
she &apos;s easily confused ?
like a blind donkey .
but she does not like it being pointed out ,
so you have to be very careful .
she also doesn &apos;t like me ,
&apos;cause i cut down on her speaking schedule .
and the jewish stuff ?
and the jewish stuff .
looks expensive .
it is .
you don &apos;t know wine .
you bought it &apos; cause you like the picture on the label .
pretty mountain .
see the wagon ?
it &apos;s very lovely .
okay . i forgive you .
i didn &apos;t know i was apologizing .
you were ...
in your own way .
by the way , you ... you didn &apos;t get our business .
you were cut after the first round .
you , uh ... you want your bottle back ?
no . keep it .
hello , mrs. florrick .
hello .
you testified that
you gave a campaign speech
at the greengate retirement center in northbrook on october 18 ?
yes .
what specifically did you talk about in this speech ?
objection . relevance .
the alleged deal took place
after a speech by mrs. florrick .
it &apos;s all part of a whole , your honor .
yes , but the fact that mrs. florrick
spoke about the retirement age hardly matters .
objection , your honor .
if the counselor wants to get on the stand ,
i &apos;ll swear him in .
okay . you &apos;re both overruled .
you can answer , mrs. florrick .
i spoke on the retirement age
and other things .
mrs. florrick , you testified that after your speech
you participated in a conversation with
eli gold and greengate ceo hugh saxon ?
if you say so .
yes ...
you said this , during mr. perrotti &apos;s questioning .
well , i @-@ i go to so many of these events ,
for peter , and , uh , they @-@ they all
tend to blur into each other .
mrs. florrick , are you saying
you don &apos;t remember this meeting ?
i suffered a stroke several months ago ,
and it &apos;s left me with , uh ,
shall we say ...
cognitive ... issues .
did you talk to her about this ?
no .
do you recall if eli gold was even at this event ?
objection . asked and answered .
and the witness may have erred
in that earlier testimony .
overruled .
again , mrs. florrick , do you recall
if mr. gold was present when you spoke
at the greengate retirement center ?
ms. tascioni ...
there are days when i can &apos;t even recall my own name .
thank you . no more questions .
so , why &apos;d you do that ?
it &apos;s the truth , isn &apos;t it ?
the issue on the table
is whether there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate
mr. gold arranged and agreed to a vote @-@ bribery deal .
i was fully convinced there was ,
until mrs. florrick &apos;s admission about her cognitive challenges .
which i &apos;m afraid , mr. perrotti ,
leaves you with only frank landau &apos;s testimony ,
and that is not enough to bring to the jury .
so we have no choice but to disqualify ...
your honor , we wish to amend out complaint
and add a new coconspirator to the charge .
objection !
i know mr. perrotti is highly competitive and aggressive
and wants to assert himself ,
but you were about to dismiss .
your honor , you previously approved our extension
for the production of our discovery .
we submit that the extension is still in force .
we ask merely for the 24 hours .
granted .
we need to talk about the bishop case .
oh . we &apos;ll have all the motions ready well before ...
i already revised this bill . i cut the hours .
you cut your hours .
you were instructed to cut the associates &apos; hours .
i thought we were trying to keep the bill down .
does it make a difference where the hours come from ?
a considerable one .
clients like to see partner hours .
it reassures them .
a disproportionate number of associate hours
leaves them to wonder whether their case is still a priority .
the associates are the ones doing all the heavy lifting .
it doesn &apos;t seem right to penalize them .
they &apos;ll find other opportunities to make up the hours .
you &apos;re management now , alicia .
you &apos;re not an associate-- stop pretending that you are .
will the other associates grumble about you ? yes .
but if you pretend you &apos;re still their peer ,
they will grumble all the more , and they will come to hate you .
this is not the queen &apos;s hamlet .
you cannot dress up as a peasant here .
so stop it .
it is galling to them ,
and it is galling to me .
did saint alicia sign off on the brief ?
i didn &apos;t get a chance to show it to her .
she &apos;s in with diane .
any idea what they were talking about ?
probably other ways to shaft us .
she &apos;s been the golden girl since the day she got here .
yeah , well , life lesson : be nicer to her ,
so she doesn &apos;t cut our hours on the next case .
hi . everything good in here ?
yeah . just plowing away on the bishop case .
good . don &apos;t let up .
by the way , the issue with the bill has been resolved .
alicia cut her own hours instead of yours .
but keep up the good work .
all right , we &apos;re live in 20 minutes .
wrong side .
i believe your group is going to be watching from the other wing .
thank you .
it &apos;s not going to work , you know .
what &apos;s that ?
jordan ...
sent you over here to unsettle me before the debate .
it &apos;s not going to .
you know , they &apos;re always wondering
if men and women can really be friends .
but the real question is :
can women ?
i mean , there &apos;s no question that immigration is a complex issue .
but let me just say this--
we are illinois , not arizona .
thank you , mr. states attorney .
oh , i &apos;m sorry . i think , according to your ... pre @-@ agreed rules ,
i &apos;m supposed to refer to you as mr. florrick .
that &apos;s all right , petra .
i won &apos;t hold it against you .
thank you .
and i &apos;ll let you call me ... petra .
now , let &apos;s see . ms. hayward , do you have any response ?
i do .
i am thrilled that the state &apos;s attorney
has found the latino vote .
our state is only 16 % hispanic ,
and yet of the nearly 10,000 inmates of cook county prison ,
which you oversee , 36 % are hispanic .
she &apos;s really going after him .
oh , he &apos;s doing fine .
well , those statistics tell a very frightening story
if you live in mr. florrick &apos;s county
and your skin is not white .
how many of the lawyers
working under you are african @-@ american , mr. florrick ?
less than five percent .
yes , and that is a problem which we are addressing ...
you were told about this lack of diversity
in a staff memo two years ago ,
and you &apos;ve done nothing .
thank you . ms. hayward ...
how did she know that ?
from me . she &apos;s using it .
... the question we were addressing was immigration ?
i thought we were encouraging a free range of topics here .
whoa , whoa , whoa . everyone .
mr. florrick , would you like to respond to miss hayward
on the issue of preferential hiring ?
no , thank you .
come on , peter .
we have just one more witness , your honor .
good to hear , counselor .
we call josh perrotti .
we object to this witness , your honor .
strenuously .
the defamatory comments that frank landau made about my client--
they were made to ausa perrotti .
his testimony is more than relevant .
your honor , the always @-@ creative ms. tascioni
is using this suit to obstruct my federal case .
which is not my problem , mr. perrotti .
here you &apos;re a private citizen
who &apos;s out of order in my court .
the witness sounds perfectly relevant to this case .
mr. perrotti , come get a view from the front .
enunciate . i want to make sure he hears you .
oh , he will .
i will fight for you .
that &apos;s what your vote means to me .
if you want someone who &apos;s polite and calm , vote for peter ,
but if you want a fighter , vote for me .
thank you , maddie .
well , that brings us to our halfway point .
we &apos;ll take a short break now .
this is the illinois democratic gubernatorial debate .
and we &apos;ll be right back .
oh , she &apos;s trying to bait you .
you stick with the plan , we &apos;ll be okay .
hmm . how am i doing ?
mostly good .
that &apos;s all we need is mostly good .
tell me the truth .
i don &apos;t know strategy , but you need to call eli .
how much time do i have ?
hey , peter ?
three minutes .
peter ? peter , we need to talk .
jordan , i actually have to ask you a question .
but isn &apos;t it true , mr. perrotti ... ?
you can call me josh .
but isn &apos;t it true , mr. perrotti , that you failed
to objectively prove this vote @-@ purchasing charge in federal court ?
for the moment .
time is irrelevant here , isn &apos;t it ?
you either prove this ...
how bad ?
oh , well , clearly , she &apos;s treating this debate
like it &apos;s a game changer .
jordan wants me to stick to policy and not push back .
ugh ! you can &apos;t play rope @-@ a @-@ dope , peter .
you bland out when you don &apos;t punch .
back in two minutes , everyone .
and don &apos;t let her near you .
my guess is , she got the advice
that she should stand near you when you start bullying .
don &apos;t let her .
well , i can &apos;t have her chasing me around the stage .
just be aware of the camera frame . there are three cameras .
keep her from getting in the frame with you .
how do i do that ?
walk the outskirts of the arena ,
closest to the bleachers .
the cameras can &apos;t get cross @-@ angles .
sure ...
okay ?
your three minutes are up ?
yeah .
i forgot how good you are at this .
thank you .
i really miss having you run the show , eli .
you can &apos;t prove the federal charges against eli gold ...
i know .
yeah , i ... i miss you , too .
okay . good luck .
yeah . you , too .
... can &apos;t prove it at this moment ?
correct .
and isn &apos;t it true that frank landau
was disqualified as a coconspirator ?
well , in the judge &apos;s opinion , yes ,
but that doesn &apos;t make it any less true .
really ? how is that ?
the federal court has decided ...
no , it hasn &apos;t decided .
it has left the question open .
until you bring in another coconspirator ?
yes .
and have you found another coconspirator ?
again , your honor , this testimony is being used
purely to shake me down .
that &apos;s awful .
please answer .
yes , i have found another coconspirator .
and who is that ?
mr. perrotti . josh ?
i &apos;m afraid you need to cough up the name ,
or be held in contempt .
who is the new coconspirator ?
diane lockhart .
simply put , mr. florrick has spent
the last dozen years being a politician .
i &apos;ve spent them building and running a company .
thank you , maddie .
and thank you for staying within your time limit .
mr. florrick , do you have anything here ?
would you like to pass ?
mr. florrick , you can
bank your time if you like .
come on . come on . come on .
mr. florrick ?
um , you know , you ... you talk about creating jobs , ma &apos;am ,
but isn &apos;t it true that recently
you closed your company &apos;s semiconductor plant
in schaumburg and shipped 1,200 jobs to mexico ?
we also opened a distributing center in aurora ,
creating 1,000 new jobs .
60 % of which are part @-@ time and don &apos;t see benefits .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s exactly true .
oh , what is true
62.5 , to be exact .
added to the 30 % of your employees recently furloughed ...
what &apos;s he doing ?
he &apos;s trying to win .
they were furloughed because the economy was hit .
now that the economy is coming back ...
you &apos;ll try to union @-@ bust them .
excuse me .
last month , in a conference call with wall street analysts ,
didn &apos;t you say that within five years ,
you would drive the unions from your plants ?
i did not ... that is not what i said .
that is not what i said . i said ... i said ,
union costs , union demands ,
were increasing costs and making it difficult to be competitive .
uh , so it &apos;s okay to cut your employees &apos; wages
while you renovate your summer home on lake geneva ?
peter , i believe the audience member
asked a question about over @-@ regulation , not ... me .
yes , but i believe we &apos;re encouraging a free range of topics here .
diane lockhart ,
senior partner at lockhart @-@ gardner .
ms. lockhart , this is a lockhart @-@ gardner invoice
to greengate retirement centers .
it includes a 25 % discount for eli gold &apos;s
crisis management services .
would you please read the handwritten initials at the bottom ?
d.l.
you initialed this invoice ?
yes . will gardner or i sign off on every bill
before it is sent to a client .
your honor , ms. lockhart conspired with eli gold
to offer greengate services at a discount .
she &apos;s the coconspirator .
your honor , that is a stretch .
not at all .
there are two ways to show conspiracy--
the agreement of services received ,
and the agreement of services offered .
this is for services offered .
we would agree . ms. lockhart ,
did you approve eli gold &apos;s
25 % discount to greengate ?
no .
you just testified you initialed this invoice .
yes , but i didn &apos;t approve it .
i only signed off on it because
my supervisor instructed me to .
i &apos;m sorry . aren &apos;t you and will gardner the bosses ?
when this invoice came due , our firm was in bankruptcy .
we were under the control of a court @-@ appointed trustee ,
mr. clarke hayden . he was the one in charge .
he was eager to boost cash flow and
had us offer clients discounts for quicker payment .
if ms. lockhart did not approve that discount ,
it rules her out as a coconspirator , your honor .
no , the charge still stands .
it will be amended to reflect lockhart @-@ gardner
as the coconspirator ...
yes , but the trustee , mr. hayden ,
was an employee of the creditors , not lockhart @-@ gardner .
isn &apos;t that right , ms. lockhart ?
it is .
so , mr. perrotti , are you going to continue
to play musical coconspirators ,
or are we done here ?
well done .
thank you .
do you like the ballet ?
no .
me , neither . let &apos;s not go together .
dinner ?
no .
may i ask why ?
no .
you did right by us on those hours .
thank you .
do i want to know the names i was called ?
let &apos;s just say ,
some of your fairy tale favorites got some play .
well , you might want to break &apos; em out again .
my notes are in the margins .
don &apos;t worry about the preamble .
i thought we were set .
we were .
i &apos;ll need the revised brief tomorrow .
no later than 10 : 00 .
polling says that 56 % of the viewers think
that i won the debate .
it &apos;s probably a couple of points higher .
they always under @-@ sample younger voters .
no landlines .
you &apos;re still packing .
i &apos;m still damaged goods .
well , i want you back .
kresteva will use this .
ugh ! kresteva will use anything and everything .
you can &apos;t be sentimental , peter .
you think that &apos;s sentimental ?
how about this ?
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
well , are you gonna stay ?
because i don &apos;t see myself
getting to springfield without you .
or washington ?
or washington .
okay , i &apos;ll stay .
good . now , unpack all that crap , and let &apos;s get to work .
