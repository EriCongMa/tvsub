you &apos;ve lasted all year ! good for you .
you could still use the copier where i actually work .
but come by at lunch so my boss doesn &apos;t see you .
kim will freak out . she doesn &apos;t like me .
i don &apos;t think my boss likes me .
i don &apos;t think mine likes me .
maybe it &apos;s a universal thing .
maybe because you &apos;re all hanging around here at 11 : 30 on a wednesday .
let &apos;s head off to work .
thank you .
sure .
you will not believe this .
i was making copies , and ralph lauren came in .

you kissed him ?
totally .
phoebe , are you serious ? yes
he came in and introduced himself.the next thing i know , we &apos;re making out !
phoebe , you do know he &apos;s married ?
phoebe.i &apos;m supposed to ask every guy i make out with if he &apos;s married ?
no , yeah , i should .
hey , joey .
can i talk to you for a second ?
there &apos;s a kid in this picture.do you know this kid ? is it a relative ?
no . i just thought it was cute .
that &apos;s what i was afraid of . okay ....
i really want you to feel at home here , but ... some of this new stuff , it &apos;s too girlie .
like what ?
like this . pictures of cute babies we don &apos;t know .
we can &apos;t have that .
joey , it &apos;s anne geddes . she &apos;s a famous artist .
i don &apos;t know this baby . i don &apos;t know if she &apos;s a famous artist or not .
i don &apos;t want to be a jerk , but you &apos;re changing too much around here .
i &apos;m sorry . i wanted to make the place a little nicer .
but it &apos;s too much stuff .
you know , you got the candles and the &quot; foofy schmoofer &quot; thing here.over here , you got a picture of a watering can .
i just thought .. i &apos;m sure it &apos;s a famous watering can .
but come on.and what is with the really hot stick in the bathroom ?
it &apos;s a curling iron .
well , that &apos;s okay then .
okay , my towels , for instance . i come into the bathroom ...
and my towel is not on the floor , where i keep it .
it &apos;s up here on some hook .
and it smells different.-it &apos;s clean .
it feels different.it &apos;s dry .
all right , i can make my peace with the clean , dry towels .
also what is with these chips you bought ?
it &apos;s potpourri . you &apos;re supposed to smell it .
well , that &apos;s like summer in a bowl .
kim , hi .
i handed in that marketing report , and i never got to hear what you thought .
i didn &apos;t read it .
the spring line &apos;s really gonna be great this year , huh ?
ya
i hear ralph lauren fooled around with someone in the copy room .
tell me everything .
hey , guys .
what &apos;s up ?
you know .... oh , my god
what happened to your teeth ? i whitened them .
really ?
what do you think ? i think i shouldn &apos;t look directly at them .
come on , seriously .
they &apos;re really , really , really white .
what was wrong with your old ... human teeth ?
i did leave the gel on a little longer than it said to .
how much longer ?
a day .
tonight is your date with hillary .
i know . that &apos;s why i did it . are they really that bad ?
you &apos;ll be fine . hillary &apos;s blind , right ?
she will be after tonight .
oh , rach . do you notice anything .. ?
your teeth ? yes , i saw them from outside .
you guys are never gonna believe this ... but phoebe made out with ralph lauren .
what ?
oh , my god !
she ran into him at my office , and they just made out .
the craziest thing is , now my boss likes me because ... it &apos;s the best gossip she &apos;s heard all year .
i am proud of all my friends today .
i can &apos;t believe phoebe made out with ralph lauren.i &apos;m so jealous !
hi , i &apos;m chandler , your live @-@ in boyfriend .
chandler , please . come on.look at him .
well , i am no woman , but that is one tasty dish .
here.who &apos;s the silver fox ?
that is your make @-@ out buddy . don &apos;t you recognize him ?
oh , wait . &quot; phoebe , i love you . kiss me , please . &quot;
that &apos;s not ralph lauren . it sounds like him , though .
what ?
ralph doesn &apos;t look like that guy .
he &apos;s young , and he &apos;s got long hair and a beard and a hacky sack ..
oh , my god . that &apos;s not ralph lauren . that &apos;s kenny the copy guy !
what ?
i told my boss that someone made out with ralph lauren .
if she finds out that i lied to her , she &apos;ll hate me even more . phoebe !
why would the copy guy say he &apos;s ralph lauren ? to get you to make out with him !
this will make them look less white .
nope .
colors that don &apos;t work are ... blue , yellow , green , red , black , white , orange and purple .
do you wanna try this highlighter again ? no , i think it poisoned me a little .
the date starts in an hour . what am i &apos;m gonna do ?
maybe if your skin was lighter , your teeth wouldn &apos;t look so bright .
oh , great ! so all i need to do is get some new skin . thank you .
if we put just a little bit of makeup on you ..
whoa ! we &apos;re not 13 anymore .
this is the only thing left that has a shot at working .
won &apos;t she notice i have makeup on ? half the guys out there have makeup on .
what ?
half the people .. i mean .. just try it and see .
i am not putting on makeup .
hello ? ross , could you put up some of these flyers for me ?
no ! demon ! demon !
our drawers will smell nice , and we didn &apos;t waste these pantyhose .
god forbid we throw out old underwear .
you know what ? i &apos;m gonna go over to joey &apos;s .
we &apos;ve got to organize the wrapping paper .
i &apos;ve really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today .
in fact , we &apos;re two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple .
this has been a girlie day . you &apos;re right . i &apos;m sorry .
i just feel like i need to be in a &quot; guy &quot; place ... do kind of a &quot; man &quot; thing .
you go over to joey &apos;s and ... drink some beer and hammer up some dry wall .
when guys hang out , they don &apos;t just drink beer and hammer up dry wall .
when girls hang out , we don &apos;t have pillow fights in our underwear .
i &apos;m sorry . we do.i don &apos;t know why i said that .
hey , chandler .
come on in . we &apos;re knitting potholders .
no , thanks , josephine .
ross , i was wondering if ..
oh , my god ! where are all the men ?
hi , kim .
hi , rachel .
remember what happened yesterday ? well , it didn &apos;t happen .
you didn &apos;t cancel the fabric order from taiwan ?
okay , two things didn &apos;t happen .
remember i told you someone made out with ralph lauren ? well , it turns out that &apos;s not true .
it &apos;s not true ? that &apos;s interesting.because i checked .
only one keycard was used to access the copier yesterday during lunch , and that keycard belonged to you .
you think i made out with him ?
listen to me ... sleeping with ralph is not gonna get you my job .
i don &apos;t want your job . i don &apos;t .
this is a mistake . i didn &apos;t make out with him.nobody made out with him .
i didn &apos;t use my keycard yesterday.i don &apos;t even know how to use my keycard .
hi , ralph .
hi , kim .
ralph lauren
yeah . nothing happened.you could cut the sexual tension in here with a knife .
after that , what could i do except become a chef ?
soon , i hope to open my own restaurant .
you &apos;re a really great listener.most guys i go out with , they talk and talk .
it &apos;s like , &quot; shut your mouth . &quot; you know ?
i &apos;ve been talking too much . why don &apos;t we talk about you ?
come on , i want to know .
okay . i &apos;m from long lsland.i came to the city for college .
i have a 5 @-@ year @-@ old son , and in my spare time ... i like to read spy novels .
but let &apos;s talk more about you .
if you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan ...
your arrangement will look fresh much longer .
joey , that is such a great tip !
monica , i need to talk to the girl with the flowers .
okay , but i &apos;m gonna teach you how to make a bird feeder ... out of a pine cone and some peanut butter .
i love birds .
what is the matter with you ?
what ?
you &apos;re arranging flowers !
you got dead flowers !
you &apos;ve got a picture of a baby dressed like flowers !
this is not joey !
look , i am still joey , okay ? flowers , they &apos;re just nice to look at .
and that happens to be a picture by a famous artist of a famous baby .
you &apos;re turning into a woman .
no , i &apos;m not.why would you say that ? that &apos;s just mean .
now i &apos;ve upset you ? what did i say ?
it &apos;s not what you said . it &apos;s the way you said it .
oh , my god ! i &apos;m a woman !
so now she thinks that i made out with him to get her job .
why didn &apos;t you just tell the truth ?
i did .
she doesn &apos;t think anyone would confuse kenny the copy guy with ralph lauren .
what if kenny were the real brains behind the whole company ?
what if kenny hired that ralph guy to be the pretty front man , huh ? did she ever think of that ?
you were with kenny today.just for a second .
phoebe , what am i gonna do ?
the only thing you can do . sleep with him .
i &apos;m not gonna sleep with him .
i mean , i could , but i wouldn &apos;t .
sleep with kenny .
that wouldn &apos;t help me .
oh , yes , it would .
i &apos;ve had a really good time tonight .
i rarely connect with someone this much on the first date .
me neither .
i &apos;ve had a really good time too , you know .
are you gonna eat that bread ?
i just like the smell .
you make me laugh .
would you like to move to the couch ?
maybe i &apos;ll just turn down the lights a little ?
how about all the way ? okay .
wow , cool poster.or should i say , &quot; groovy poster &quot; ?
so ... where were we ?
are those your teeth ?
you can see them , huh ?
yes . they &apos;re insanely white .
i did that for you .
what &apos;s the matter with you ?
what &apos;s the matter with me ? you &apos;ve got a black light . it &apos;s 1999 !
oh , good . kim , hi .
hi , rachel . i wanted to ask you , have you seen the new ralph lauren sheets ?
what am i thinking ? of course you have .
okay , look.i &apos;m sorry that i lied to you before.you were right .
ralph and i were an item , but we &apos;re not anymore .
oh , really ? yeah , he dumped me .
he said , &quot; rachel , i can &apos;t do this .
even though you &apos;re a very , very ... very beautiful woman
i can &apos;t do this . i &apos;m married and i &apos;m sorry . &quot;
but he said , ...
&quot; and you will never get promoted especially not above kim , ...
who is an integral cog in the ralph lauren machine . &quot;
you expect me to believe ..
hi , ralph .
hi , kim .
oh , my god.he gave you the coldest look i &apos;ve ever seen . it &apos;s like he hates you !
then it is true !
of course it &apos;s true . and it hurts so bad .
oh , honey , come here.oh , it &apos;ll be okay.we &apos;ve all been there .
you and ralph ?
kenny the copy boy .
i need to talk to you .
what &apos;s the matter ? you upset ?
would you like me to get a pint of ice cream and two spoons ? no , no , no ice cream .
look .... we gotta get rid of all this girlie stuff in here .
i gotta be a man !
the living room has to remain a guy place , okay ? that &apos;s the way it has to be .
i &apos;ll just put it all in my room .
good . great.thanks for being so understanding.i didn &apos;t want to make a big deal out of this .
but you could put the picture of the famous baby in my room.i mean , if you want to .
okay .
and maybe the watering can there.sure.
and a couple of these little tiny boxes .
joey , do you want me to put it all in your room ?
