that &apos;s it , fran . one more push .
as babies , we were easy .
one cry meant you were hungry ...
it &apos;s a boy .
how is he ? is he okay ?
another , you were tired .
he &apos;s perfect .
it &apos;s only as adults that we become difficult .
hey , wake up , pretty lady .
morning .
it &apos;s gonna be a great morning .
we made you eggs benedict .
where &apos;s sofia ?
napping . ooh . try the eggs .
the--the bacon is jalapeno @-@ infused .
tomorrow we &apos;re making short ribs infused with cabernet .
i just want coffee
infused with cream .
no , yeah , but just try the hollandaise .
i @-@ i have to get ready . i have a big surgery--
hold on .
so i--aah .
i &apos;m so sorry .
we start to hide our feelings ,
put up walls .
it gets to the point where we never really know
how anyone thinks or feels .
what ?
my key &apos;s not working .
yes , because i changed the locks .
oh , come on !
yes , this isn &apos;t my trial ,
but that doesn &apos;t mean you can lock me out of
my own mouse lab .
my mouse lab .
bailey , don &apos;t--
without meaning to , we become masters of disguise .
q &apos;s hyperglycemic , too .
which means that about 20 % of the mice with implants
have diabetes again .
look , we--we should really tell dr. webber .
no , we are not telling him .
well , okay , but--
kepner , it is precisely because of challenges like this
that i handpicked you for this trial .
you handpicked me because
cristina , alex , and jackson all said no .
and because you go above and beyond .
look , you solve problems like no one else can .
say it with me .
i solve problems ...
... like no one else can .
exactly . now let &apos;s get to work .
fifth year is the hardest year of your residency .
every surgery you do will go on your record ,
the wins and the losses .
in just a few months , you will ...
what did i miss ?
you &apos;re o.b. now ?
oh , how the mighty have fallen ?
she misses zola . her uterus hurts .
oh , leave her alone , dirtbag .
... of the more complicated surgeries you &apos;ve scrubbed in .
you are embarrassing me .
i &apos;m getting to deliver babies .
i &apos;m making life , you know ?
yeah , you know what ? you &apos;re making me gag .
okay , slumming it in o.b. for a few weeks is okay .
whatever . but ...
wearing the vagina squad scrubs in public ?
it &apos;s--ugh .
we have standards , meredith .
it is extremely important that you rack up
as many good outcomes as possible for your boards .
i am implementing a system .
i will receive an e @-@ mail if any of you exceed
more than ten bad outcomes in your o.r.
ten--any more is unacceptable .
welcome , dr. kepner .
sorry . i got stuck in the lab with bailey .
i don &apos;t care where you were .
i care that you already have , let &apos;s see ...
two bad outcomes in your o.r.
loser .
of course that &apos;s nothing
compared to karev &apos;s impressive five bad outcomes .
i keep getting dud patients .
tell it to your board examiners .
the point , people ,
is to keep your bad outcomes to a minimum ,
or you will be hard @-@ pressed to find a fellowship next year .
who are you texting ?
who do you think ?
uh , dr. yang ,
are you sure that you &apos;re getting all this down ?
bad outcomes are bad ,
which is why i have zero so far ,
a perfect record i plan to continue
during my ortho rotation this week .
no one dies during a hip replacement .
let &apos;s hope .
i &apos;m sorry .
i will make sure that the scrub nurse
separates your macrodissectors from your micros .
i told her that yesterday , but she must have forgotten ,
which i know sounds like an excuse ,
and i am sorry for that too--
lexie .
yes .
leave . now .
okay .
can you go have sex with him and make him be nicer ?
i told you , he &apos;s going to be hard on you
until you learn all of his quirks .
they &apos;re not quirks .
they &apos;re these scary , nitpicky rules ...
just to drive me crazy .
like what is the deal
with him needing 16 towels in the o.r.
at all times ?
well , if i give you all the answers ,
you &apos;ll never learn on your own .
you &apos;re just as mean as he is .
hi . how &apos;s your day going ?
bad . my o.r. is a mess ,
my caseload is an exercise in boring .
which you can &apos;t tell me
because we can &apos;t talk about neuro .
right .
i know something else we can do instead .
no kissing in the hospital .
why not ?
we don &apos;t work together anymore .
you &apos;re just my wife .
9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 .
okay . now you can go .
i should be grateful that they &apos;re getting along , right ?
but i &apos;m not , though . i &apos;m bitter .
all they do is cook together
and talk about food and watch shows
where other people talk about food and ...
uh , don &apos;t--don &apos;t read that .
&quot; i &apos;ll bend you over the conference room table and &quot; --oh !
okay , why did you let me read that ?
my husband can &apos;t get enough of me .
jealous ?
yes , actually .
arizona and i haven &apos;t had much &quot; alone time &quot; lately ,
and so instead , we eat .
oh , that &apos;s depressing .
yeah , let &apos;s just talk about the case .
okay . what is it ?
okay .
hip replacement , shoulder dislocation ?
this is your first time copiloting with me .
you think i &apos;m gonna bore you with routine crap ?
get outta there .
my feet hurt !
mr. and mrs. moser ? hi .
hi . sorry .
my , uh , lazy sack husband thinks that this is his bed .
oh , it &apos;s--it &apos;s not ?
no , this is our patient &apos;s parents .
yeah .
this is dr. yang . she &apos;s my co @-@ surgeon on the case .
oh , so nice to meet you .
get up !
come on . pretend you have manners for a second .
what , the kind of manners that allow you
to insult your husband in front of strangers ?
stop it .
stop fighting .
you &apos;re scaring the doctors .
hi . tyler .
i &apos;m , uh , i &apos;m not staring at your boobs .
i mean , i @-@ i am , but i @-@ i can &apos;t help it .
tyler suffers from
a degenerative bone disease called cervical spondylosis .
he was in a car accident two years ago ,
which further injured his neck ,
and so we are gonna build him a new one
in a 3 @-@ day , 3 @-@ part surgery .
do not point that camera at me !
you look beautiful , sweetie .
oh , are you the o.b. ? drugs , please .
where &apos;s the attending ?
she &apos;s stuck in an emergency c.
they were driving home to olympia when her water broke .
she &apos;s two weeks early .
hi , mary . i &apos;m dr. grey .
oh , i don &apos;t care who you are , just give me drugs .
okay , let &apos;s see if we have time for that .
over here , honey .
wow . you &apos;re crowning .
did you just say &quot; wow &quot; ?
this--this is it . it &apos;s all happening .
clay , i swear to god ,
if you don &apos;t point that camera someplace else !
oh , god !
are--are you pushing ? she shouldn &apos;t push , right ?
just give me a second .
look over here . i &apos;ll distract you .
brain tumor !
brain tumor .
i call brain tumor on the video camera !
you can &apos;t call brain tumor right now .
it &apos;s my tumor . i make the rules .
brain tumor ?
nobody said anything .
she has a grade iv astrocytoma .
you coulda led with that .
it &apos;s been a little hectic .
head .
hi , emma .
sweet little girl .
it &apos;s called a butterfly tumor
because it extends into both sides of the brain .
she has about six months .
she &apos;s dying , so they decided to have a baby ?
well , that &apos;s not the point .
so i had st. catherine &apos;s send over all her scans ,
and i want you to take them to derek
and get him to do a consult .
derek hates me .
you are better off taking them yourself .
the only thing holding our marriage together
is that we can &apos;t talk about neuro ,
so he can &apos;t know that i had anything to do with this .
so you &apos;re using me ? i &apos;m your tumor mule ?
do you want him to stop yelling at you ?
he needs to be inspired .
hey , karev , trade with me .
ortho for cardio .
i mean , you need a good outcome ,
and i &apos;m just doing a stupid neck surgery with callie .
there &apos;s no such thing as a stupid neck surgery .
you &apos;re just afraid of tanking your winning streak ,
so now you want back on the easy train .
not happening .
what easy train ?
uh , that &apos;s what dr. karev calls your service .
&apos;cause your patients never die .
it &apos;s a compliment .
oh , it has nothing to do with the fact
that you &apos;re piling up bad outcomes ?
they were dud patients .
oh , i &apos;m sure . shall we ?
who do i have to pay to get the tennis match on in here ?
uh , we &apos;ll have a nurse look into it .
yeah , well , make sure she &apos;s cute .
chuck cain , 71 .
came into the e.r. last night
after a syncopal episode .
the scan showed a narrowed aortic valve
that we will replace during open @-@ heart procedure .
open heart ?
it &apos;s a safe surgery . don &apos;t worry .
i don &apos;t care about safe . i care about the scar .
how big ?
10 inches at most .
10 ? nope .
not doing it .
trust me
a @-@ a scar is a small price to pay
for how much better you &apos;re going to feel .
how old do you think i am ?
you &apos;re 71 .
because you read the chart .
but if you didn &apos;t , you &apos;d say 60 , right ?
look , i &apos;m in incredible shape ,
and the ladies agree .
but look , the minute you open up my chest ,
i &apos;m done .
there &apos;s no more meeting women at the pool
with a scar like that .
i mean , all they &apos;ll see
is a future of doctor &apos;s appointments ,
hospital visits , and--and bad sex .
so , no . no open @-@ heart surgery .
look , mr. cain .
we &apos;ll investigate alternatives .
and get me a decent pillow while you &apos;re at it .
my ass has got more cushion than this thing .
is it july yet ?
&apos;cause i need a whole new crop of residents .
huh . little grey still struggling ?
oh , she &apos;s drowning .
i didn &apos;t know how lucky i had it
until meredith was off my service .
do you know how to read these budget reports ?
no . why do you think i gave up that job ?
you &apos;re a huge help .
homemade maple @-@ ginger scones .
try .
oh , no , no , no , really .
i just had a big lunch .
the scone &apos;s a very tough pastry to make .
you have to be exact with the ingredients ,
the baking temperature--
hey , how is the house coming ?
oh , we &apos;re working on the drywall now .
really ?
all right . i get it . i &apos;m a bore .
but avery &apos;s doing all my surgeries ,
and i &apos;m taking up cooking to keep my mind sharp
for when the next big case rolls in .
yeah , you keep telling yourself that .
dr. shepherd .
yes .
dr. grey is looking for you . she says it &apos;s important .
my wife ?
nope .
lexie .
try a scone .
you know you want to .
attaboy .
today we &apos;re taking out the old hardware .
tomorrow sloan will remove the scar tissue .
and then we &apos;ll implant the cage .
yeah ! all right .
so ... you &apos;re turn .
just get in there and , uh ,
you know , have fun with it .
why wouldn &apos;t you just do a fusion in this case ?
isn &apos;t that standard procedure ?
he &apos;s had four fusions already ,
so we &apos;re really going for a long @-@ term solution .
really get in there with the drill .
right , right , right .
come on .
but the risk of paralysis is quite high with your approach .
our approach , and only lame surgeons do fusions .
we &apos;re not lame .
we &apos;re fun ... and badass .
here , like this .
there you go .
yeah . there you go . felt good , right ?
yep .
yeah .
dr. yang , that &apos;s your phone .
really ? during surgery ?
oh , it could be anyone .
melanie , could you please read dr. yang &apos;s message aloud ?
melanie , don &apos;t do that .
yes , melanie , do . it could be chief hunt .
he might need dr. yang on an urgent matter .
yep . definitely sounds urgent .
melanie , don &apos;t touch that phone !
just , um ...
turn it off .
no more texting me in the o.r.
well , did anyone ...
no .
good .
&apos;cause the only thing getting me through these
budget reports is that ,
and i get to do this .
i have to check on my patient .
i don &apos;t want callie to give me a bad outcome .
i &apos;ll be quick . come on .
hunt , i found last year &apos;s budget .
i was just won--whoa . oh , whoa .
um , uh , uh , excuse me .
no , it &apos;s okay . i was just leaving .
keep your phone on .
okay .
in the conference room ?
richard--
hunt , you &apos;re a chief now .
act like it .
in the conference room ?
so tell me you found the article
i asked you for two days ago .
no , but i &apos;m really close .
this is the chart of a patient with a butterfly tumor .
butterfly tumors are inoperable .
no , i @-@ i know , but this patient ,
she &apos;s a new mom , and it &apos;s a really sad story , actually ,
but i was wondering if you could do a quick consult--
this is why you needed to find me so urgently ...
to tell a woman her tumor &apos;s inoperable ,
to remind her how sad her story is ?
no , i @-@ i @-@ i just--
just find the article .
hey , um , april , i can &apos;t cover the e.r. tonight .
i have to do research for shepherd .
no , what ? i--
i--take it up with shepherd .
i--come o--
where are my mouse labs ?
oh , uh , s @-@ sorry .
i was stuck in the o.r. all day ,
trying not to fall behind in my surgeries .
oh , so you &apos;d rather just fall behind in my opinion of you ?
i will take care of it right away .
it &apos;s hard to be a team when only one player cares , kepner .
now we removed all the old hardware ,
and we &apos;re all set to implant the cage tomorrow .
so just try to get some rest , okay ?
oh , well , i &apos;m gonna stay the night
and make sure , uh , he &apos;s got some company .
i &apos;ll stay . i @-@ i @-@ i don &apos;t need the rest .
a @-@ and i do ?
i don &apos;t know .
you &apos;re always talking about
how--how big the--the bags under your eyes are , so--
what ?
aren &apos;t visiting hours over ?
yes . they are .
sorry .
um , uh , all right . well , call if you need anything .
all right ?
okay .
okay .
surgery brings out the worst in people .
marriage brings out the worst in them .
i &apos;m grateful they dropped everything
to help take care of me ,
but seriously , the second i &apos;m better ,
i &apos;m moving out .
i need some peace and quiet .
well ...
let me help you get some now , okay ?
wh @-@ what the hell ?
i want to check your reflexes every half @-@ hour
to make sure there &apos;s no nerve damage from the surgery .
you &apos;re home already ?
yeah , it &apos;s the advantage of a boring caseload .
well , did your day get any better ?
yes , if you count the fried chicken sandwich
i got in the cafeteria .
any interesting cases tomorrow ?
meredith .
no work talk .
i &apos;ll be right back .
meredith .
why didn &apos;t you tell derek about mary &apos;s tumor ?
i @-@ i @-@ i did . he said it was inoperable .
did you show him the scans ?
did you tell him it was in the frontal lobe ?
uh , i didn &apos;t get a chance .
um , i am naked and wet in the shower , so--
derek &apos;s a tumor junkie .
he needs to see the scans
and meet the patient to spark the case ,
the same way he needs a 16th towel in the o.r.
to position his arm on the microscope .
are you gonna remember all this or do i need to write it down ?
naked and wet in the shower .
i need to write it down .
chuck cain .
i gave you his blood work five hours ago .
alex , i need you to cover the e.r. tonight .
no .
look , before midnight would be nice .
i &apos;m still looking .
it &apos;s the e.r.
people will die if we &apos;re not there .
which will be your fault , not mine .
got it . here you go .
finally .
alex , please , can &apos;t you just be a person for a second ?
see ?
this is why you don &apos;t deserve this job .
you &apos;re bad at it .
you get all stressed out and frantic
and nobody wants to listen to you .
you have no authority , and your voice ...
it gets all high and nasally like this when you &apos;re nervous .
it &apos;s annoying .
you &apos;re annoying , so , no ,
i can &apos;t be a person for a second .
deal with your own crap !
still not paralyzed .
good .
do you know you snore ?
yes , and i &apos;ve been told it &apos;s adorable .
it &apos;s not .
morning .
oh , sorry we &apos;re late , baby .
oh , of course , your , uh , smarty @-@ pants father
refused to check the traffic report .
are you hungry ?
uh , he can &apos;t eat before surgery .
see ? i told you , no food allowed .
oh , please .
one little doughnut won &apos;t hurt .
actually , it will ,
just like it will it hurt all of you
by promoting , uh , high cholesterol and plaque buildup .
i confirmed your consults tonight ,
and i know you &apos;re gonna ask me about that--that article , but--
oh , you--you haven &apos;t found it yet ?
look !
butterfly tumor .
wait . i mean , all the doctors we &apos;ve seen
said the tumor &apos;s inoperable .
surgery could put her in a coma or kill her .
it &apos;s just another set of scans .
exactly , and it &apos;ll be good for you
to have some alone time with emma .
you know , that way i can die knowing that
you &apos;re not gonna drop her on her head .
fine .
run the scans .
okay .
i really don &apos;t have time for this .
two more moms just came in .
well , yeah , but as long as no one &apos;s crowning ,
they &apos;ll be fine .
what are you doing ? !
uh , researching a new surgery for my neck guy .
what are you feeding my mouse ?
q. is diabetic . a doughnut could kill him .
then why is he in your office ?
so meredith can run tests on him .
are you really gonna do her grunt work ?
oh , bailey blames me for richard losing his trial .
the last thing she wants is for me to work on it .
which is why you &apos;re doing it in secret .
okay , that is the worst idea i &apos;ve ever heard .
seriously .
i am your chief resident , dr. grey .
which means if you cross me ,
i will make your life a living hell .
i will put you on call every night ,
i will assign you dumb interns ,
and i will make sure
that you get every exploding bowel and rotting limb
that comes into this hospital .
okay .
relax . i &apos;ll do it .
o @-@ okay .
it &apos;s &apos; cause i made my voice different , right ?
that &apos;s-- that &apos;s why you lis--
go away before you embarrass yourself more .
oh , that &apos;s owen . duty calls .
are you two talking yet , or is it just sex ?
not just sex .
hot , dirty , stand @-@ on @-@ my @-@ head sex .
i &apos;ll take that as a no .
you know what ? who cares if we talk ?
besides , if you want to talk about something ,
how about the fact that you &apos;re wasting your fifth year
playing around with vaginas and mice ?
want to talk about that ?
do you really stand on your head ?
i &apos;m very talented .
this procedure is minimally invasive .
and the great news is ,
the scar will look like this .
it &apos;s much smaller .
yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , but i want this instead .
what the hell is that ?
that &apos;s my friend tony &apos;s groin .
i had him e @-@ mail me a picture last night .
he had the same problem with his valve last year ,
and his doctor replaced it with a catheter through the groin .
see ? barely any scar .
it &apos;s called a tavi .
yeah , a tavi is an experimental procedure .
there are-- there are tons of risks--
uh , bleeding , stroke--
look , i &apos;m the one having this and paying for it , right ?
so if i say i want a tavi , give me a tavi .
look , there is a much safer solution to your problem .
it &apos;s called a @-@ a rash guard . you wear it at the pool .
no one will see your scar .
clearly you &apos;ve never been to palm beach .
only fatties wear rash guards .
i can &apos;t get through to this guy .
he wants a tavi .
look into it and decide if he &apos;s a good candidate .
i &apos;ll look into a tavi .
see ? now that &apos;s the answer i was looking for .
i knew you had it in you , kid .
hey , grey .
uh , no , keep walking .
eyes ahead . act normal .
i saw kepner take a mouse into that room .
what &apos;s going on ?
i don &apos;t know anything .
you &apos;re blinking .
okey . now you know something .
is something wrong with the device ?
i really shouldn &apos;t talk about it .
grey .
bailey &apos;s not gonna find out about it ?
bailey locked me out of my own mouse lab .
i &apos;m not telling her crap .
some of the mice are hyperglycemic .
we &apos;re running some tests to find out why .
all right , this is what you do--
get a healthy mouse , run some labs
and compare the stats . can you do that ?
well , april &apos;s being a little bit--
oh , you can handle kepner , grey .
now i &apos;m on call , so page me when you get the results .
okay .
all right .
hi there . uh , um , beautiful day , isn &apos;t it ?
oh , damn it .
you need a hand ?
uh , no , ju @-@ just , the cage won &apos;t fit .
his bone &apos;s so destroyed , the screws won &apos;t hold .
we should do the fusion instead .
no .
well , i researched it .
we can refuse him if we take down enough of his scar tissue--
i said no .
my surgery got pushed .
and i can &apos;t pick up the short ribs .
the butcher closes at 6 : 00 , right ?
why are you so gung @-@ ho to do this ?
why are you so not ?
we could roast a chicken .
yes .
could we please shut up about dinner ?
please .
oh , sorry .
forget it . we &apos;re closing him up .
what ? no .
yes . we need more time
to figure out a new game plan that &apos;s not a fusion .
so i &apos;m gonna secure the cage temporarily and close .
which means i &apos;m free to go to the butcher .
problem solved .
most astrocytomas spread out through the corpus callosum .
it fans out like smoke .
but if you look at your tumor , mary ,
i &apos;ve never seen anything like it .
look at the edges-- they &apos;re smooth , defined .
they &apos;re easier to cut around .
yes , if i can keep my entire dissection inside
and never let it drift outside--
i &apos;m sorry .
are you , um ,
saying what i think you &apos;re saying ?
mary , i think i can remove your tumor .
i love this guy .
we don &apos;t know this guy .
he &apos;s amazing , right ? tell my husband .
he &apos;s pretty amazing .
this isn &apos;t a decision you make on a whim .
you &apos;re right . you need time to
make this decision .
we don &apos;t need time .
we &apos;ve decided . sign me up .
emma .
yeah .
if you get to call brain tumor ,
i get to call emma .
it &apos;s not just the two of us anymore .
we have a daughter .
she needs these six months with you .
i mean , you &apos;re her mom .
please , mary .
don &apos;t do this .
you &apos;re ditching o.b. to be a vet now ?
oh , april dumped bailey &apos;s trial on me .
i would be annoyed , but it turns out i &apos;m good with mice .
and i found her secret snack drawer .
sweet .
hey . hey , that is not your food . not your food .
what--what have you done to my office ?
get over it . i &apos;m helping you .
and go get me a healthy mouse .
bailey hasn &apos;t left the lab in 48 hours .
i @-@ i can &apos;t steal another mouse .
i can &apos;t steal another mouse .
fine .
fine . just keep going ,
and--and good job .
tell me what it feels like to get a bad outcome .
neck guy &apos;s paralyzed ?
not yet .
what would happen if i took my name off the case ?
do it . you can take my old guy .
altman &apos;s trying to make me do a tavi on him .
oh , no way . you &apos;re just asking for a bad outcome .
peanut ?
no .
derek ran an m.r.a. and
found out he can reach under the pericallosal vessels
and reach the tumor on both sides .
so he &apos;s operating ?
no .
mary &apos;s afraid of the risks .
well , clay really , but she listened to him .
okay , but did you tell them how good he is ?
yeah .
kind of .
do i have to do everything myself ?
hot .
right ?
come on . come on , g.
come on , little guy . come on .
your voice doesn &apos;t whisper , kepner .
sorry . sorry .
i @-@ i- didn &apos;t want to distract you .
i need to run an a1c on g.
g. is healthy .
we don &apos;t need to run an alc on him .
yes , but i think i &apos;m on to something , though .
on to what ?
i &apos;ll tell you when i figure it out .
i read the research ,
i talked to some other surgeons .
but i &apos;m not doing a tavi on you .
and that &apos;s your final answer ?
that &apos;s my final answer .
i &apos;ll give you some time to make a decision .
and here i took you for a guy
who had a pair on him .
it &apos;s a stupid scar , chuck .
you really want to die because of it ?
hey . sorry i &apos;m late .
i got stuck planning tomorrow &apos;s surgery .
oh , well , did you figure it out ?
you know it . sofia ?
mm . she is asleep .
mm . she was so talkative--whoa .
aw . i miss that .
mm . i bet i know what else you miss .
who &apos;s hungry ?
i got braised short ribs ,
roasted potatoes , and a nice pinot from napa .
it looks amazing .
it &apos;s not me .
oh , me neither .
it &apos;s me .
ohh . oh !
the car seat &apos;s not clicking in
and it &apos;s supposed to be clicking .
let me try .
you just have to line up the arrows .
i heard dr. shepherd came by .
look , uh ...
i &apos;m sure he &apos;s a great surgeon ,
but we &apos;ve seen a lot of great surgeons .
and i @-@ i know i &apos;m the bad guy here , but ...
i just had a baby .
i want to be happy , you know ?
at least today .
maybe a couple more months .
but i-- a couple more months isn &apos;t enough .
she wants more .
we made this decision a long time ago
because we knew that once emma was born ,
we &apos;d be too emotional .
she &apos;s not thinking--
but now she &apos;s seen and held her baby .
and she can &apos;t imagine not being here .
and she wants more time .
i want more time .
i &apos;m not ready for her to die .
and she &apos;s not , either .
and that &apos;s why she wants to fight .
diane schiffman would make a great wife , you know ?
and she &apos;s great with the kids at the block party .
yeah , &apos; cause she &apos;s always drunk .
what about wendy mcdowell ?
ah , too uptight .
she &apos;s turn emma into a nervous wreck .
erin miller ?
she &apos;s way too hot for you .
mary .
i know .
it &apos;s time .
come here .
thank you , honey ,
for giving me this .
and i &apos;m gonna see you soon .
you , too , my precious , little perfect girl .
okay .
okay .
okay , let &apos;s go .
here we go .
are you kidding me ?
how the hell is this not working ?
dr. torres--
just give me a second , okay ?
as co @-@ surgeon on this case ,
i say we abandon the reconstruction ,
and do a standard fusion .
we &apos;re not quitting . how many times do i have to say that ?
i &apos;m simply recommending an alternative solution .
yeah ?
well , your solution sucks .
he &apos;s lost motor evoked responses .
okay , that &apos;s it . you know , i &apos;m--i &apos;m out .
i &apos;m taking my name off the case .
wait .
there &apos;s an electrode out .
unbelievable .
all right . how &apos;s that ?
great . he &apos;s fine .
done . your name &apos;s off the case .
5.5 @-@ millimeter cobalt chrome rod
and alternating cross connectors .
i &apos;m gonna link the three rods together .
what ? you can use the cobalt rods for this ?
what do you care ? you &apos;re off the case .
go !
all right . let &apos;s get the next one .
i compared healthy and hyperglycemic mice .
it looks like the islet cells are being rejected .
so it &apos;s not the device . well , that &apos;s good .
uh , it could be
a recurrence of autoimmunity ...
or a problem with the engraftment .
maybe it &apos;s not the cells being rejected .
maybe they &apos;re just not surviving because of other causes .
so we should check for signs of rejection ?
exactly . okay . bump me .
we &apos;re looking in the wrong place .
the device is working ,
but something is harming the islet cells .
how did you figure that out ?
it doesn &apos;t matter .
so tell bailey to look for signs of rejection .
and who do you think you are ?
what , god , is that who you are ?
dr. bailey , she was just doing
what i asked her to do .
because either you &apos;re god ,
or you are the most reckless , arrogant resident
i have come across in my entire career .
i mean , to put your hands on another clinical trial
after you already ruined one is a level of stupidity
so staggering--
i delegated .
this has nothing to do--
you are fired from my trial , kepner .
and you ...
just give me back my mouse .
i--
not until you read my research .
dr. bailey !
read my research .
hey , that kinda works .
okay , i &apos;ve cleared out the tumor
on the right side of the brain , but look .
see all those vessels blocking the way now ?
it &apos;s like a line of defense .
that &apos;s why the tumor &apos;s so smart .
it grows on both sides of the brain
so we &apos;ll be too scared to cross over .
but she has six months . that &apos;s--that &apos;s something .
you know , a @-@ and you tried .
there &apos;s no shame in stopping now--
lexie .
yeah .
we &apos;re not stopping .
but you just said the tumor is smart .
we &apos;re smarter .
bipolars .
hey , it &apos;s my fifth year .
i have to defend every decision
made in my o.r. at the boards .
do you know why i picked you to be my co @-@ surgeon ?
i @-@ i ...
because you ...
you take crazy risks in the o.r.
but the surgeon i &apos;ve worked with the past three days ?
safe ,
boring , a ...
b @-@ minus version of herself .
i get it . fifth year is competitive .
your whole career depends on it ,
but if you &apos;re not careful ,
you &apos;re gonna wake up one day and realize
that you &apos;re no longer the badass ,
hard @-@ core ,
spontaneous , take @-@ charge ,
crazy , fun person you thought you were ,
but instead , some sad , sorry wife
who stays in every night and talks about food
like it &apos;s an orgasm when it &apos;s clearly not .
an orgasm is an orgasm .
i &apos;m sorry . what ?
don &apos;t let fifth year get to you .
you mind if i sit ?
please .
she &apos;s herniating .
what the hell happened ?
a vessel leaked . the tumor &apos;s starting to swell .
okay , we &apos;re gonna have to drain the ventricle .
get me a blunt @-@ tip needle . now .
you &apos;re going in blind ?
we have no choice .
just tell me .
we got it .
we got the whole tumor .
thank you .
thank you .
you have a mommy , emma .
you have a mom .
once they have prepped you ,
i will meet you in the cath lab and do the tavi .
hey , chuck , what the hell ?
crap .
look , the lady had a bigger pair than you .
no hard feelings , okay ?
let &apos;s go .
hey , doll , how old do you think i am ?
i @-@ i want my patient back .
i was being cautious . you-- you can &apos;t punish me for that .
actually , i can .
you &apos;ve had some bad outcomes . we all get bad outcomes .
your problem is
that you let it get to you , and now you &apos;re scared .
the only thing worse than
a bad surgeon is a scared one .
pretty soon , you &apos;ll be able to do everything
you couldn &apos;t do before--
feed yourself , look girls in the eye .
how about sports ?
don &apos;t be an idiot , idiot .
you know that he cannot do sports .
will you just get a divorce ?
she said everything .
and what did i tell you about this name calling ?
get a divorce .
well , okay , then i got a new one for you .
bitch face .
oh , how original .
i said get a divorce !
i get it .
you had to stay together until i was outta high school .
then it was college ,
and then this neck thing happened ,
but that &apos;s over now .
my neck &apos;s fine ,
so you two are free to leave each other .
listen , kiddo .
no , baby , it has nothing to do with you .
we just think at the top of our
he &apos;s just this way all the
you hate each other !
you hate each other .
it &apos;s obvious . so go .
go to the court .
just get a divorce !
okay , why don &apos;t we give tyler some space ?
how &apos;d that feel ?
awesome .
uh , you paged ?
eight of the mice are hyperglycemic .
what ?
i &apos;ve been locked in this lab all day and night ,
hiding it from you ,
trying to understand why ,
and--and meredith grey figured it out .
now i &apos;ve got just weeks worth of ...
tests to run and mice to monitor ,
real patients to check on .
well , so you get help .
from who ? i fired kepner .
there &apos;s no way in hell i &apos;m putting meredith on this trial .
oh , help will show up . trust me .
it always does .
so ...
you &apos;re gonna go home ,
get some rest .
the work will be here in the morning .
go . right now .
don &apos;t worry , q.
i got your back .
he just went in blind and he hit the ventricle .
it was the most incredible thing i have ever seen .
all sloan taught me today was how to brine a chicken .
altman called me a chicken .
what you said to me the other day
was horrible , mean , and--
all right . you &apos;re doing it again .
you &apos;re like a friggin &apos; mosquito .
yeah , well , that &apos;s all changing .
lexie , you &apos;re leading pre @-@ rounds tomorrow .
jackson , you &apos;re touring med students ,
and , alex , you &apos;ve got nights in the e.r. for the next week .
any of you argue with me ,
and i &apos;ll take you off the o.r. board indefinitely .
i , on the other hand ,
just got fired from bailey &apos;s trial .
so i &apos;m gonna spend the night
drinking and flirting with boys .
no . we can &apos;t do this anymore .
no more sex in the hospital .
you know , i &apos;m chief now .
i have to act like it .
fine . whatever .
you--do you want to go get dinner ?
uh , sure .
it &apos;s not always easy to speak your mind .
or we could just go home and have sex there .
let &apos;s do that . yeah .
okay ? let &apos;s do that .
okay .
sometimes you need to be forced to do it .
hey . you brought pizza ?
no . pizza ? i made a coq au vin .
what are you-- what--
wait . no , no , no .
what are you doing ?
not my coq au vin !
mark , i love you .
i love how great you are with our daughter .
i love that you and arizona are friends .
but you ...
you need to leave , &apos; cause
tonight i &apos;m gonna eat pizza
and drink beer in bed with my wife
and tell her all about the neck i just built ,
and then we &apos;re gonna have lots and lots of sex .
okay ? we &apos;re great parents ,
but we &apos;re more than just mommies and daddies .
we are hot and we are sexy ,
and your new hobby--
the hollandaise and the short ribs
and the coq au vin--
is getting in the way of our sex lives .
so ... please , start having sex again .
okay ? but not tonight .
&apos;cause tonight , you &apos;re babysitting .
can i at least have some pizza ?
that was incredibly hot .
sometimes it &apos;s better
to just keep things to yourself , though .
play dumb ...
i had a good day .
so good , in fact , i wanna break our rule
and tell you about it .
even when your whole body &apos;s aching to come clean .
don &apos;t .
are you sure ?
come here .
so you shut your mouth ...
keep the secret ...
