so you lied and told me charlie wasn &apos;t real .
i thought i was doing the right thing .
lesli stone was in radley .
long enough to know mona and charles .
lesli &apos;s not pretending to be charles .
she &apos;d only heard charles &apos; name once .
the night that bethany snuck out of radley and never came back .
charles snuck out that night too .
if you keep this up , i will take you
far away from here , i mean it .
you &apos;re gonna bury me at aunt carol &apos;s farm too
right next to charles ?
sara was pretty and poised and perfect .
and everything she gave you
she took two things away .
i wished sara was dead before she disappeared .
maybe you could sell me something
that would help calm my nerves .
yeah . what ?
pot . maybe some brownies .
it &apos;s not just the junkyard ,
i @-@ it &apos;s the bottle of hair color in the dark room ,
the text in sullivan &apos;s office .
how did a know we were all gonna be there
at the exact same time ?
bitch chipped us .
hi , this is alison .
i &apos;m not available to take your call .
please leave me a message .
you find anything ?
yeah .
most microchips are about the size of a grain of rice
and all they contain is an id number , but ..
... ours feels bigger .
it &apos;s like a modified it
so that he could track our every move .
oh , my god ! what is that ?
somebody removing their dog &apos;s microchip .
we &apos;re gonna have to get it out somehow .
yeah , on second thought , maybe we should just keep ours in .
maybe we should .
spencer , i was joking .
no , i &apos;m not .
a doesn &apos;t know that we know he &apos;s tracking us .
that &apos;s the only edge that we have over charles .
and we have to figure out a way to use it .
that &apos;s your phone .
is it ali ?
mona .
we &apos;re on for tomorrow morning .
lesli finally agreed to talk to us .
okay , ali has to be there . charles is her brother .
she needs to know he &apos;s alive .
yeah .
and anything else that lesli can tell us .
she might know who a is .
and not just a name , but his face .
hi , this is alison .
i &apos;m not available to take your call ..
where the hell is she ?
dad , please , you have to tell me what &apos;s going on .
where were you just now ?
where are you taking me ?
some place safe .
he &apos;s alive .
and he &apos;s coming for us , isn &apos;t he ?
第六季 第七集
oh , good , you &apos;re up .
yeah .
um , i was just gonna go to the brew and pick up
some muffins for you and caleb and surprise you .
i actually have a surprise for you instead .
go ahead . open it .
thirty thousand dollars ?
it &apos;s your tuition , hanna .
i promised you i would figure out how to pay for college .
didn &apos;t i ?
mom , eh , how did you ..
while you were gone i , um , i applied to every scholarship
i could find and @-@ and , um ..
you know , it helped planning for your future
and believing you still had one .
i can &apos;t believe it . i mean , one of the applications
actually paid off , literally .
wait . &quot; the carissimi group . &quot;
why does that sound familiar ?
they probably sponsored a hospital wing or something .
jason recommended it . he said his mom donated all the time .
well , you at least owe me a hug .
seriously getting worried over here , ali .
and we need to talk . can you just call me back ?
emily ?
it &apos;s claire , sara &apos;s friend . we met .
yeah . yeah , i remember .
that girl , sabrina told me
that you weren &apos;t working here anymore .
i was just about to leave .
y @-@ you were looking for me ?
and sara .
i @-@ i went by her mom &apos;s a few times
but she wouldn &apos;t tell me where she was .
at least not right away .
is sara--
no .
no , i just dropped her off at work .
work ? sara &apos;s got a job ?
that &apos;s great .
god , if i went through what she did , i don &apos;t think
i &apos;d remember how to read , never mind be able to--
we all remember how to read .
no , i mean , that ..
i &apos;m sorry . i don &apos;t know the right thing to say here .
of course not . no one does .
look , sara and i had some hard times .
but she was my friend .
no one deserved what you guys went through .
i just wanna see her .
you still have the same number ? i can tell her to call you .
yeah . thanks .
yeah .
uh , wait .
sara &apos;s not at work right now .
she &apos;s at therapy , and i pick her up in two hours .
hey , you &apos;re back .
i was actually just leaving .
oh , oh . change your plans .
i can &apos;t .
wait . what &apos;s going on ? is your mom home ?
no . no , she &apos;s still in philly . i just .. you have to go .
i &apos;m sor ..
i &apos;m sorry . you really have to go .
i haven &apos;t seen you in days .
i know .
and i really wanna catch up
and i wanna hear all about your police seminar .
maybe tonight ?
hmm . i &apos;m working .
spence , what &apos;s going on ?
hmm ? nothing .
did something happen when i was out of town ?
no . nothing . no ..
i decided that i was gonna write the valedictorian speech
and aria offered to help me
so she &apos;s waiting on me right now .
we don &apos;t do secrets . you and me .
we tried that before tanner knew about a
and ... we practically fell apart .
i just don &apos;t wanna go back to that .
neither do i , okay ?
i &apos;ll call you later .
bye .
you promised she &apos;d be here .
that &apos;s what she told me .
call her again . sorry , this doll &apos;s freaking me out .
i got here as fast as i could . where &apos;s lesli ?
probably got eaten by one of her rats .
aria .
what ?
leave the doll alone .
oh , lesli just texted me .
she said she &apos;s made a lot of progress with her stability
and she thinks that this sort of confrontation
might set her back .
unbelievable !
tell her to get her ass over here
or i &apos;ll show her a confrontation .
come on . field trip .
lesli knows who charles is ,
and you know where that bitch lives . let &apos;s go .
no one &apos;s going anywhere . lesli isn &apos;t lying .
that girl is one lost marble away from a major breakdown .
look , i @-@ i swear , lesli doesn &apos;t know anything else .
if she did , she would tell me , and i would tell you .
the night that bethany and charles escaped from radley
you were with alison .
ali told us . you picked her up on the side of the road .
you took her to the lost woods .
so maybe you saw somebody .
some guy who could have been charles .
i wish that i did , but no , i didn &apos;t see anybody else .
what about at radley ?
someone you talked to stole the a game from you
while you were there . that is what you said .
i @-@ i know i did , but i was on so many drugs .
i didn &apos;t even know who i was talking to .
i mean , half the time , i thought i was
being haunted by ali , the other half of the time
i thought i was auditioning for &quot; american idol . &quot;
you don &apos;t have to see her if you &apos;re not ready .
there &apos;s no rush .
no , i want to .
i ... just don &apos;t even know what we &apos;d say .
it &apos;s been so long .
i can come with you if you want .
act as a buffer , so it doesn &apos;t get weird .
there &apos;s actually this really cute dessert place
halfway from here to courtland .
we could meet her there . it &apos;s nice and chill .
okay .
h @-@ how is therapy--
did we--
sorry . you go .
no . you talk .
if @-@ if you want .
last night , uh ,
i &apos;m not sure whether i dreamed somethin &apos; or ..
... it actually happened .
oh , it happened .
um , unless you want it to be a dream .
then we can pretend .
no .
please .
i &apos;ve had enough pretend kisses .
this was my first real kiss in three years and ...
i can &apos;t believe i was half asleep for it .
there will be more .
i mean , with other people . i mean , not ..
okay , um ...
what i &apos;m trying to say is
we &apos;ve both been through a lot
and ... we should probably take the time
and think about what we want .
yeah , um ...
you &apos;re probably right .
lorenzo .
everything okay ?
i hope so .
is ali here ?
uh , no .
no , she &apos;s out of town with my dad . he told tanner .
do you know when she &apos;ll be back ?
i &apos;m not sure . sorry .
i tried callin &apos; her a couple of times .
she usually calls me back right away .
i didn &apos;t know you two had a usually .
can you let her know i stopped by ?
will do .
and you can tell your guys to take off .
ali won &apos;t be back for a couple of days .
i thought you didn &apos;t know when she &apos;d be back .
i don &apos;t .
oh . sorry . didn &apos;t see you there .
getting rid of all these ?
oh , picasso had his blue phase .
i had a doll phase . time to find a new subject .
why ?
you &apos;re the one who said all my photos were creepy .
well , i ... i mean , creepy in a good way .
yeah . well , they &apos;re officially starting to creep me out , so ..
i take it you didn &apos;t get into that art show ?
i don &apos;t know yet .
but even if i did , it is still time to find
something new to photograph .
hey ! what &apos;s going on with you ?
you &apos;ve been pacing outside my room for , like , an hour .
did you tell mona not to call me ?
what ? no .
did she tell you that ?
that would require her actually talking to me .
so no .
what are you saying ?
aria , i haven &apos;t talked to her or seen her
since you guys were rescued .
oh , my god . you &apos;re kidding .
no , i left a hundred messages .
i @-@ i stopped by her house . i talked to her mom .
she doesn &apos;t wanna see me .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
because i thought maybe you were the reason .
i &apos;m not .
mike , i swear .
so what should i do ?
sara ordered the peanut butter .
oh ! i just figured we &apos;d all share .
you don &apos;t mind ?
no .
i have , like , a thousand--
this place okay ?
shoot .
uh , okay .
how &apos;s avery ? how &apos;s tina ?
how &apos;s monkey ?
who &apos;s monkey ?
my dog , who &apos;s so not a puppy anymore .
oh , he &apos;s huge !
he &apos;s like a person .
he thinks he &apos;s a person .
wait . so you just left ?
yeah .
i couldn &apos;t just stand there and keep on lying to his face .
i mean , toby knows me .
he knows i &apos;m not just sitting on my hands
waiting for tanner to figure this out .
he &apos;s right , hanna .
we are exactly where we were two months ago .
yeah , except now we have hardware in our necks .
god , we &apos;re like cyclops .
cyborgs .
i &apos;m pretty sure it &apos;s pronounced cyclops .
god , that &apos;s weird .
what ?
that scholarship i got from the carissimi group
it &apos;s not listed on any of the usual websites .
and their homepage looks like
it &apos;s some sort of an investment firm .
战略投资以及实现盈利结果的领导能力
just try that community tab .
doesn &apos;t say anything about a scholarship .
hanna .
wait , that &apos;s where i saw this name before .
in radley .
i don &apos;t get it .
why would the people who paid to shut down radley
pay for my tuition ?
oh , my god . you don &apos;t know about lexi .
she &apos;s a mama bird .
joe ?
nobody knows .
we , uh , we &apos;d have to head back .
check in with my mom .
yeah , we should get the bill .
my parents wanna have you over for dinner .
maybe tomorrow ? or tonight .
that ... that &apos;d be great .
i mean , you could sleep over , maybe stay a few days .
or as long as you want . we have that extra room--
sara has a place to stay and police protection at my house .
it &apos;s safer there .
i also don &apos;t think lieutenant tanner wants you
outside rosewood .
well , just think about it .
we &apos;ve got a lotta reese witherspoon movies
to catch up on .
i will . thanks .
beloved .
what ?
that &apos;s what carissimi means in latin . beloved .
as in , charles , beloved son ?
you said that jason told your mom about this scholarship ?
what if mrs. d &apos;s favorite charity
was also her oldest son &apos;s bank account ?
the owner has to be listed here somewhere .
hello ?
i .. i &apos;m sorry . i can &apos;t hear you .
who is this ?
where &apos;s spencer ?
uh , she &apos;s on the phone .
she &apos;ll be right back .
tell her to thank me later .
hello ?
can you hear me ?
ali ?
i &apos;m at a hotel .
my dad drove me in the middle of the night .
he hid my cell phone , his car keys .
i &apos;m stuck here .
ali , i need to tell you something .
charles is alive .
he threatened my dad .
he said he &apos;s coming home for his birthday .
his birthday ?
today , spencer .
my dad called jason and begged him to leave the house .
but he &apos;s determined to see charles
no matter how dangerous it is .
okay , and your dad didn &apos;t think to tell any of us ?
charles isn &apos;t after you .
not this time .
but if jason tries to meet him ..
alison .
just one minute , dad .
where &apos;s my phone ? did you take my phone ?
whoever you &apos;re talking to , you hang up now !
ali ?
i &apos;ve got to go .
please , talk to jason and be careful .
i know you &apos;re trying to protect me , but what about jason ?
what about my friends ? we have to tell someone .
tell the police .
tell them what ?
that i lied about my son for two decades ?
that i thought he was dead and i was wrong ?
will you just give me one day
just one day to figure things out ?
emily .
that was claire .
her dad &apos;s gonna pick me up in a couple hours .
what ? why ?
because it &apos;s the right thing to do .
i &apos;ve put you and your mom out for so long .
no , you haven &apos;t . you know that .
look , i didn &apos;t wanna say anything
but i &apos;ve met claire once before .
and she didn &apos;t have the nicest things to say about you .
i &apos;m just not sure that ...
she told me .
just now .
honestly , emily ,
i didn &apos;t like me that much back then either .
a @-@ are you sure about this ?
you don &apos;t look sure .
i &apos;ve been thinking about what you told me earlier .
about what i want .
if we &apos;re not living together , we can go on a real date .
maybe eat a meal your mom hasn &apos;t made for us .
and isn &apos;t chaperoning .
that would make it easier ... to do this .
open up ! jason , come on .
we know you &apos;re in there !
jason , just talk to us , please .
maybe he &apos;s not home .
but his car &apos;s right there .
he knows why we &apos;re here .
his dad already tried to get him to leave .
you mean ali &apos;s prison guard .
everything okay over there ?
yeah . we &apos;re fine .
hey , have you seen jason ?
looks like he doesn &apos;t wanna be bothered right now .
anything we can help you with ?
no , thank you .
what are you doing here ?
i convinced your mom to let me in .
i @-@ i @-@ i brought you something .
from aria , actually .
i don &apos;t wanna see you . you should leave .
why ?
i @-@ i thought you were dead , mona .
i covered for you . i did everything that you asked .
i know . that &apos;s the point , mike .
i know what i put you through .
you begged me not to go through with it .
you stood in this room and fought with me for days
and i still did it .
you thought you had to .
and i was wrong .
everything we went through , it was all for nothing .
hell is a very lonely hole in a &apos;s dollhouse
and maybe i deserved to be there .
what you did was incredibly stupid .
and yeah , i &apos;m pissed as hell at you .
but that doesn &apos;t matter .
yes , it does .
it matters .
not to me .
not now .
all that matters is that you &apos;re alive .
look at me , mona .
so you think jason &apos;s gonna meet charles somewhere tonight ?
well , a &apos;s not gonna show up to ali &apos;s house
with all those cops out front , so it &apos;s probably gonna be
so place outside of rosewood .
i put one of caleb &apos;s gps trackers on jason &apos;s car .
so the second he moves , we can follow him to a.
follow him ? we &apos;re being tracked too , remember ?
charles will know we &apos;re onto him .
that &apos;s why we have to remove our chips and leave them behind .
our phones , anything that a could be monitoring .
charles has to think he &apos;s in the clear .
we can &apos;t ambush a.
charles has everything but superpowers .
hey , guys , listen to me .
this has to be some sort of a trap .
a is always one step ahead of us .
emily &apos;s right .
ali asked you to keep jason safe
not to get us all kidnapped again .
we need to take this to the police
and just step back from it .
the second this goes over
the police radio or an e @-@ mail
a is gonna know he &apos;s being followed
and he &apos;s never gonna show up .
well , that &apos;s fine by me .
i don &apos;t want him anywhere near us .
wait , so we &apos;re just supposed to give up ?
let charles keep owning our lives
and keep lying to the one &apos;s that we love ?
i &apos;m not gonna live like that .
we &apos;ll tell toby .
he &apos;s got a badge and a gun . he can keep us safe .
we can follow jason without charles knowing
and if anything goes wrong , he &apos;s gonna be right there .
what about sara ?
what happens when a retaliates ?
aria , if this works , i promise you
there &apos;s not gonna be any fallout .
charles is never gonna be able to hurt us
or anybody that we love ever again .
so let &apos;s say we go through with this .
how the hell are we supposed to remove these microchips ?
well ..
spencer and i have been studying videos online .
you can &apos;t be serious .
oh , my god .
who wants to go first ?
i don &apos;t have much time . i &apos;m in the middle of a shift .
just hold still .
what &apos;s going on up there ?
what &apos;s with the band @-@ aid ?
just ..
if you could hold your questions until afterwards
that would be great , okay ?
okay , i wanna tell you everything .
i &apos;m going to tell you everything
but i need you to promise me one thing first .
you cannot tell anybody , including tanner .
at least not at first .
i can &apos;t promise that .
please , i &apos;m not asking you for it forever .
i &apos;m just asking you for one night .
please .
this little boy is jason .
and this one is a.
his name is charles dilaurentis .
what was she using these for ?
photographs .
of what we went through ?
yeah .
you &apos;re gonna have to forgive yourself sometime .
do you want me to go ?
spencer , this information could have helped us .
tanner needed to know about this weeks ago .
i didn &apos;t have a choice .
a was holding a knife to sara &apos;s throat .
he threatened everybody we &apos;ve ever cared about .
please , i just need one night .
if we do not fly under the radar , this won &apos;t work .
jason &apos;s on the move . we &apos;ve gotta go .
no , no , no . nobody &apos;s going anywhere .
toby , i just told you . it has to be this way .
you &apos;re not going near a or charles
whatever that freak &apos;s name is .
you want my help , we &apos;re doin &apos; it my way .
no , you can &apos;t tell tanner .
if a finds out about this plan--
i got it , spencer .
but if you try and follow me , or go near jason
she &apos;s gonna be my first call .
who has jason &apos;s gps ?
i do . this is caleb &apos;s burner phone .
hanna , you &apos;re bleeding .
what ? where ?
what do you mean where ?
where dr. amateur hour cut your neck open .
you can &apos;t do this alone .
i &apos;m not letting you come with me
and you &apos;re not letting me call tanner
so alone &apos;s looking like our only option .
please be careful .
and you call me the minute you find jason .
spencer , where &apos;s your surgical tape ?
i &apos;ll be right there .
going somewhere ?
i &apos;m just getting ready for bed , dad .
not all of us are planning on standing guard all night .
you want some of this , or you just gonna eat
spencer &apos;s candy all night ?
i &apos;m okay . hey , maybe we should swing by wallaby avenue .
i heard there &apos;s some activity goin &apos; on over there .
break @-@ ins .
i sure wouldn &apos;t .
it &apos;s not exactly our jurisdiction .
yeah , but there &apos;s nothing goinon here tonight .
those guys could use our help anyway .
hey , come on . the car &apos;s over here .
yeah , and we gotta let command know we &apos;re going .
no , we don &apos;t .
you wanna leave our beat and not tell anyone ?
cavanaugh , what &apos;s goin &apos; on ?
i &apos;ll explain on the way .
you &apos;re gonna come with me or not ?
toby can &apos;t call you if he &apos;s following a.
or if he &apos;s hurt .
don &apos;t go there .
like you said , toby &apos;s a police officer .
he can take care of himself .
did it download ?
yeah , it just finished .
jason stopped ten minutes ago .
hey , guys , this is right outside of rosewood .
he should have called me by now .
spence .
no !
he &apos;s supposed to be our backup .
not some one @-@ man target .
and if anything happens to him ..
i &apos;m going .
i &apos;ll go with you .
okay , i didn &apos;t let hanna perform surgery on me for nothing .
let &apos;s go .
come on .
we &apos;ll be okay .
斯宾塞 汉娜 艾米丽 艾瑞亚
thank you for coming . you &apos;re the only one who answered my call .
charles .
you here ?
charlie ?
came alone . just like you asked .
did you tell mike where you were going ?
how did you get out of there ?
sleeping pills .
i still couldn &apos;t find my dad &apos;s car keys though .
i &apos;m just glad i could help .
i know i owe you . more than just a car ride .
are you trying jason again ?
no .
no one &apos;s answering their phones , there &apos;s no point .
then who are you calling ?
911 .
alison , you can &apos;t do that !
911 , emergency 23 ..
my name is alison dilaurentis .
your emergency ?
my friends and family are in danger .
i know who a is .
his name is charles dilaurentis , and he &apos;s my brother .
there &apos;s no one here .
charlie .
don &apos;t move !
freeze !
oh , my god !
on the ground , now !
charlie !
everybody , stay back .
charlie , don &apos;t !
watch it !
watch it !
oh , my god !
toby !
no !
oh , my god ! lorenzo , are you okay ?
i &apos;m okay , i &apos;m okay .
jason , i &apos;m sorry .
don &apos;t touch me !
you had him . i saw you .
i saw you . what happened ?
hold it ! freeze ! put your hands up .
don &apos;t move !
do not move !
having two cops parked outside isn &apos;t enough ?
you need one parked in the foyer , too ?
mom , we were so close to catching him .
that is not your job ! you &apos;re a high school student .
your job is to cash in that scholarship
and go to a good college and get yourself away from this mess .
not to get yourself kidnapped again by some maniac .
mom .
what ?
what could you possibly have to say for yourself ?
i don &apos;t think we should take it .
the scholarship .
what are you talkin &apos; about ?
well , you said that ali &apos;s mom
donated to the carissimi group .
if that company is somehow connected to the dilaurentises then ..
look , i can &apos;t explain it ,
but i have a really bad feeling about this money .
hanna , listen to me .
with everything that that family has put you through
you deserve every last cent of that scholarship money .
which is why i already deposited the check .
and believe me , that felt really great .
i don &apos;t wanna talk anymore , dad . please .
they &apos;re pretty mad ?
yup .
you okay ?
i talked to mona .
we &apos;re gonna try and work things out .
you &apos;re really brave . you know that , right ?
then , why do i feel so scared ?
all the time .
i &apos;ll leave you alone .
this came for you .
while you were out .
how are you feeling ?
look , i didn &apos;t know that she put those in my bag .
okay , and i &apos;m sure that you &apos;re only supposed to take , like , one .
i really should have told you that i was having problems .
we were so close .
if you hadn &apos;t have eaten ..
toby .
i need you to leave .
wait in the lobby for your mom .
i can &apos;t have somebody come looking for you
and fi @-@ fi @-@ find me like this .
okay .
yeah .
恭喜艾瑞亚 · 蒙哥马利 你入围了
don &apos;t do it , jason .
leave me alone .
he &apos;s not worth ruining your life for .
he &apos;s not the person that you remember .
you don &apos;t know what i remember , do you ?
i was a kid when they took him .
and every memory i did have , they tried to erase .
jason ..
please .
i was gonna tell him to turn himself in .
i was gonna drive him to the police station .
all i wanted was one moment , ali .
one moment alone with my brother .
jason , jason , come play with me .
jason , ali , wait for me .
i remember this day . mom took us out of school .
and took us to the arcade for some second cousin &apos;s birthday .
she made us promise not to tell dad .
ready ... set , go .
oh , gosh .
you won .
freddie . freddie , come here , sweetheart .

yeah .
when do i have to go back ?
oh , not for a while , sweetheart .
