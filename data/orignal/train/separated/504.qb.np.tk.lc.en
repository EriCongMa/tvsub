hero worship
it &apos;s gideon .
did he suffer ?
not for long , no .
did you hear any of that ?
he didn &apos;t suffer .
i &apos;d just really like to play one more game of chess with him .
yeah .
but time will pass
and slowly you &apos;ll forget how much it hurts .
then maybe you &apos;ll find something else to
fill that empty space .
i don &apos;t want to find something else .
reid .
what , are you working late ?
just , uh , waiting for rush hour to subside .
a lot of close personal contact on the subway right now .
it &apos;s 10 : 00 . the trains have been empty for a while .
go home .
the chess will keep till tomorrow .
yeah . probably just gonna pack it up right now .
good night , spencer .
good night .
triple stuffed omelet , hold the onions .
yeah , thank you .
huevos rancheros .
i ordered a belgian waffle .
oh , right . sorry about that .
one sec .
excuse me , i &apos;m just waiting for a cream .
i will grab it for you right now , ma &apos;am .
i got two orders up . you gonna serve &apos; em or what ?
are you gonna get the order right , or what ?
i didn &apos;t know belgium was in mexico .
well , who can read your handwriting , anyway ?
order up .
uh , the cream ?
right . just a sec .
i can see it all now--
just let him get used to it .
breakfast burrito for you ,
omelet for you .
i asked for chives .
you two have a chance to look at the menu ,
or do you need a few more minutes ?
no , we come here all the time .
do you have anything that &apos;s gluten free ?
they don &apos;t have gluten free .
it &apos;s worth asking .
oh , you &apos;re right . sorry .
could we get some chives , please ?
can you check on my order , please ?
why can &apos;t you let me have a conversation with the waiter ?
order up !
do you have any hot sauce ?
eggs are runny .
help !
an explosion happened at a beanery brew house
in indianapolis earlier this morning .
first responders are reporting 6 deaths , 16 wounded .
brave guy .
anyone claimed responsibility ?
not yet .
no , but indianapolis p.d. believes it may be related
to a bomb that went off in an elementary school last week .
yeah . that was relatively low yield .
it claimed the life of morton truby .
he was a custodian working graveyard shift .
authorities found traces of tnt .
until today they thought it was an isolated incident .
could this be another boston or oklahoma city ?
beanery is a popular chain .
exactly the type of location a domestic terrorist would target .
the unsub wants everyone looking over their shoulder .
and we also shouldn &apos;t rule out a disgruntled employee
or fundamental groups .
at this point we can &apos;t rule anything out . let &apos;s move .
tnt doesn &apos;t pack much bang for its buck .
it &apos;d be pretty hard to hide the amount needed
to cause the damage to that coffee house .
this feels like page 118 .
&quot; the anarchist cookbook . &quot;
&quot; tnt for dummies . &quot;
the blast at the school seems rudimentary .
it may have been the unsub &apos;s testing ground .
the coffee house could indicate a drastic escalation .
the book also teaches you to make nitroglycerin ,
and a coffee shop could represent a steep learning curve .
so this guy is either quick on his feet
or both blasts were part of a sophisticated plan .
in that case , we can &apos;t be certain
that the coffee house is this guy &apos;s finale .
yeah . which is why the plane &apos;s been ready .
we can be in indianapolis in two hours .

&quot; the most heroic word in all languages
is revolution . &quot;
eugene debbs .
this is interesting .
the maintenance worker killed at the school
was working late installing a new circuit panel .
he wasn &apos;t supposed to be there .
so the unsub may not have intended to kill anyone .
and if he canvassed the site beforehand ,
he would have anticipated the school being empty .
exactly .
but with the coffee house ,
he struck first thing in the morning , when it would be packed .
maximizing collateral damage .
i don &apos;t like it . that &apos;s a pretty fast confidence boost .
successful bombers always have a practice run .
maybe the school was his .
but what &apos;s his endgame ?
most bombers like the attention they get from playing god .
they don &apos;t go dormant , they strike again .
so will this guy .
no one &apos;s claimed responsibility for either attack .
that could point away from a fundamentalist
or a fear driven offender .
maybe it &apos;s personal .
we &apos;ll rely on divide and conquer .
victims , witnesses , and ballistics .
see if we can find a pattern
so we can prevent a third attack .
uh @-@ uh . excuse me , have you seen agent--
please , can you help me ? i can &apos;t find my dad .
of course . what &apos;s his name ?
pat . pat aguilar .
we were together at the coffee house .
ok , i &apos;ll see if i can find anything out for you .
please ! i need to know .
where was your father when the bomb went off ?
he had to go to the bathroom ,
but he let some pregnant lady in first .
please , no one &apos;s telling me .
i &apos;ll see what i can find out , ok ? excuse me .
reid .
he can &apos;t find his father .
there are a number of people still in surgery .
maybe we should consider cognitive interviews .
witness accounts are varied , which is to be expected .
when people are more emotionally ready , it &apos;ll be a good idea .
have you seen the pregnant woman anywhere ?
yeah , she &apos;s still in the delivery room .
we should talk to the guy who rescued her .
he may have seen something the others didn &apos;t .
allen archer . he &apos;s been treated and released .
jj and kate are on their way to his house now .
are you gonna be ok ? i need to see the m.e.
i &apos;m fine .
thanks .
excuse me , do you know
if you have a patient named pat aguilar ?
i &apos;m just about to notify the family , sir .
he didn &apos;t make it .
i know . i &apos;m so sorry .
it looks like the media is scrambling for a sound bite
from their local hero .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what all the fuss is about .
anybody with half a right mind
would have done the same thing .
but they didn &apos;t . you did .
how &apos;s the mother ?
she went into labor .
it &apos;s a boy .
was this a terrorist attack ?
obviously .
i don &apos;t think we &apos;re classifying it as terrorism just yet .
so did you notice anything suspicious when you ran inside ?
anyone that didn &apos;t seem panicked ?
no . no , nothing like that .
did you see where the blast came from ?
um , there were two ,
i guess .
when i ran in there , there was only a small fire .
but then the back wall just exploded .
who &apos;s the man in the photos ?
uh , my first husband , grant .
he was a navy seal . he died in afghanistan .
and you all were friends ?
yeah . allen introduced us .
it &apos;s , uh , it &apos;s almost 3 : 00 .
i have to pick up hannah .
it &apos;s our daughter .
i &apos;ll , uh , i &apos;ll go with you .
that way you don &apos;t have to fend off the reporters alone .
oh , i think we can help you there .
ladies and gentlemen , i &apos;m ssa jennifer jareau ,
this is ssa kate callahan .
i &apos;d like to make a statement on behalf of the archer family .
allen archer did what anyone
in his place would have done .
allen saved a woman , and in doing so ,
saved her child , who i am happy to report
was born less than an hour ago .
mother and child are doing fine ,
as is allen and his wife .
but they are understandably shaken .
the archer family asks that
you please give them privacy
as they deal with today &apos;s tragic events .
wait ! that &apos;s the family . they &apos;re leaving !
sorry , guys , guess you &apos;re gonna have to capitalize
on somebody else &apos;s trauma today .
thank you .
the guy planted the device in the bathroom .
&quot; lethal weapon &quot; style .
what type of explosive did he use ?
tnt . same as the school .
the wiring &apos;s kind of sketch .
how do you mean ?
the soldering work , it &apos;s not the best .
i &apos;d say he put it together in a hurry .
maybe he was hesitant about killing so many people .
or nervous .
you &apos;d need a lot more tnt to do this kind of damage .
you would think , but ...
take a look at this .
right here .
because he put the bomb in the toilet ,
the blast is pretty well contained ,
or at least it should have been .
but the explosion shot back ,
rupturing the natural gas line .
increasing the explosion tenfold .
the question is , was it coincidental or intentional ?
he &apos;s still a bad dude , either way .
yeah , but the answer will weigh heavily on our profile .
how so ?
well , if the gas line rupture was an accident ,
the unsub &apos;s motive may not be to kill .
so learning he claimed so many lives could unravel him ,
make him even more dangerous .
exactly .
but if the gas line was planned ,
then this unsub &apos;s learning curve
is something to be reckoned with .
he might try to outdo himself .
neither of those are particularly good options .
well , what &apos;s good is we can rule out terrorism .
what &apos;s bad is we have absolutely no idea who this guy is .
i &apos;m running a trace analysis
to determine the manufacturer of the tnt .
i will download you asap .
thank you .
um , einstein , huh ?
heh . bet you don &apos;t ever forget it .
you &apos;re kind of young to be a forensic specialist , aren &apos;t you ?
finished medical school at 19
and then residency afterwards .
my dad really wanted me to live up to the family name .
again ?
uh--it helps me focus .
you know , in light of recent events ,
i think it &apos;s ok to give yourself a break .
an entire night , though .
what do you mean ?
you &apos;re wearing the same shirt from yesterday ,
and you &apos;re covering it with a cardigan from your go bag .
guess i must have gotten a little carried away last night .
well , it happens .
so , uh , what drives most bombers ?
ego , craves attention .
so he has to share his headlines .
he &apos;s not gonna be happy about that .
he might try to reclaim that attention .
the only way to do that is to strike again ,
somewhere he can ensure a higher body count .
or a personal one .
you were so brave today .
i was lucky .
i still can &apos;t believe i ran back into the fire like that .
well , you heard what those two agents said .
you &apos;re a hero .
you saved two lives .
when the second blast hit ,
i thought that that was it .
thought i &apos;d never see you and hannah again .
hey , sweetie , what are you doing up ?
i heard noises .
i thought someone was in the house .
oh , honey , it &apos;s just us . come here .
hey , did you know that allen
saved a woman and a baby from a fire today ?
really ?
really .
cool .
i think it &apos;s pretty cool , too .
tell me what happened .
oh , sweetie , i think it &apos;s time we get you back to bed , ok ?
i promise you everything is fine , fine , fine .
ok , come on .
good night , allen .
good night , sweetheart .
hey , babe .
i &apos;m gonna run to the store .
ok .
ok . i &apos;ll be right back .
with the death toll rising to 7 earlier this afternoon ,
indianapolis p.d. has released the names of those deceased ,
including pat aguilar , 65,
grace kelver , 19 , joe gardez , 27,
scott laker , 11,
jackson novert , 21 .
ryan batson , 46,
and bree wanfield , 32 .
federal authorities remain baffled
as to the perpetrators--
oh , my god .
you gotta go , baby . you gotta go , please .
take hannah and you get away from me .
far away from me , you hear me ?
take hannah and go ! brenda , please !
you gotta get out of here , baby .
ma &apos;am , you need to get your daughter out of here .
ma &apos;am , you need to get your daughter out of here .
no , i &apos;m not leaving allen .
i &apos;m sorry , but you have to .
this is for you and your daughter &apos;s safety . please trust us .
you get away from here , ok ?
get out of here , please !
please help him .
we will .
ok ? all right .
come this way , ma &apos;am .
how the hell did we beat the bomb squad here ?
i could give you statistics ,
but i don &apos;t think this is the time .
are we really gonna do this ?
turn your cell phone off .
nitroglycerin .
no , no , no . stay back . stay back !
stay back . i don &apos;t want anybody else to get hurt .
sir , stop talking . just listen . just listen to me .
we &apos;re with the fbi and we &apos;re here to help .
when you put your foot down , you triggered the arming mechanism .
now , if you move , you could set it off .
where are brenda and hannah ? are they ok ?
i don &apos;t want them to die , too .
nobody &apos;s gonna die .
they &apos;re safe . don &apos;t worry . bomb squad &apos;s gonna be here soon .
i need you to keep the exact pressure that you have on that brake
as you have right now .
if you don &apos;t , all 3 of us are gonna die .
well , can you do something ?
can you ?
this thing &apos;s homemade ,
but the framework is familiar .
yeah . yeah , i can disarm this .
i just need something sharp .
i &apos;ve got a knife in my glove box .
it &apos;s underneath the map . right there .
sir , just sit still . you &apos;re doing fine .
i &apos;m gonna get you out of here .
ok .
hey , kid .
i think you should back up .
not happening .
what &apos;s the next step ?
the trick is rendering the pressure sensor inactive
without letting the detonator think that it &apos;s time to go .
the only problem is ,
this son of a bitch built this thing by himself
and he used all the same color wires .
7 wires and you don &apos;t know which one to cut ?
i &apos;m not so crazy about these odds .
it &apos;s gotta be one of these two right here .
guys , you gotta do something quick here , man .
my foot is cramping up . i cannot keep my foot on the pedal--
sir , please , please . if you want to stay alive ,
i need you to keep that foot down and try to sit still , please .
reid ...
it &apos;s probably this wire right here ,
if he stayed true to the original design .
go with your gut .
what ? well ?
sir , you &apos;re fine . you can get out of the car .
are you serious ? you did it ?
you did it ? i &apos;m gonna live ?
let &apos;s get you to your family .
oh , god .
thank you . thank you . thank you so much .
thank you .
you &apos;ve got 4 nitroglycerin packs .
now , i &apos;ve defused it ,
but the nitro is homemade .
it &apos;s almost guaranteed to be unstable .
copy that .
rossi was right . the unsub doesn &apos;t like sharing attention .
so he &apos;s decided to eliminate allen archer .
and now he &apos;s graduated to nitroglycerin .
page 113 .
we should put the archers in protective custody
until further notice .
once the bomb squad &apos;s done clearing that house ,
i want to take another look at that device
and see if there &apos;s anything else we can learn .
we believe the man you &apos;re looking for
is an ego driven personal cause bomber .
in other words , he needs to be the center of attention .
that &apos;s why we &apos;re advising that you keep the location
for tonight &apos;s bombing attempt confidential .
if the unsub sees headlines that don &apos;t belong to him ,
we believe he &apos;ll become enraged .
he seems pretty angry now .
yes , he wants us to pay attention .
even if it means targeting the man who &apos;s disrupting his message .
so what &apos;s his message ?
look at me .
fear me .
i am god .
his sophistication level puts him in his 30s or 40s .
tnt may be easy to produce ,
but nitroglycerin is much harder to handle .
it took patience and an eye for detail .
he &apos;s controlled and methodical .
he &apos;s highly intelligent .
he &apos;ll absolutely want to witness his work ,
so we need to look at traffic cams
and eyewitness footage of the blast .
he could be on camera .
we should also canvass public spaces like outdoor malls ,
farmers markets , monument circle .
the fact that he targeted a school and a popular coffee chain
means he wants no one to feel safe .
do you think he &apos;ll strike again ?
t &apos;s inevitable . a bomber with a god complex
feels invulnerable .
we need to appease him and start communications with him .
that &apos;s how we &apos;ll catch him . thank you .
he really went for a bigger boom this time .
i recognize the make @-@ up . 92 % nitroglycerin ,
8 % nitrocellulose .
straight out of the cookbook .
good memory .
i have a thing for numbers .
and quantum theory .
funny .
the unsub certainly singled allen out .
he could have planted the device in his home ,
but instead he chose his truck
because he wanted to ensure that
allen was the one who triggered it .
he needed to make sure the hero died .
kill the family and they become martyrs .
well , it &apos;s a wonder he even realized that he triggered the bomb .
maybe he heard something when he stepped on the pedal .
what , and knew not to move ?
come on , what &apos;s this guy got ,
an ex @-@ paramilitary background we don &apos;t know about ?
brenda archer &apos;s first husband grant was military .
is it just me , or do you think it &apos;s odd that allen
ended up marrying his best friend &apos;s wife ?
i don &apos;t know . shared sorrow could build a bond .
jj and kate said the house was a shrine to the deceased .
well , that would explain why he kept all this stuff out here .
he feels like he &apos;s living in someone else &apos;s home .
that kind of man would be desperate for recognition .
he was crying .
this could be why .
reliving trauma or feeling guilty about something .
i think we should ask him .
and his wife .
that &apos;s what you guys do . you just talk a lot .
well , there &apos;s also a lot of kicking down doors involved .
sure . i &apos;m heading back to the lab .
i &apos;ll let you know what i find .
thanks .
garcia , did you find
anything in brenda and allen archer &apos;s background
to indicate a knowledge of explosives ?
nothing that sticks out .
but i am the queen of lots of things ,
including subtlety .
oh , shut up . i &apos;m talking ...
deftly sift through information stuff .
he &apos;s a carpenter
who has a severe amazon addiction .
kindle , to be specific .
what kind of books ?
self @-@ help . a lot of emo stuff .
build your self @-@ esteem , how to get over depression .
coming out of your shell .
a whole bunch of comic books .
nothing &quot; how to build a bomb &quot; related ?
no . sorry .
oh , he is seeing a marriage counselor .
hmm . thinks are not so good on the homefront .
they &apos;ve certainly improved now .
she was all over him when we interviewed them .
something tells me that &apos;s not ordinary .
allen is living in the shadow of grant ford .
maybe the coffee shop was his introduction .
garcia , brenda &apos;s first husband grant ford was a navy seal .
what was his specialty ?
oh , that &apos;s a good question .
give me a moment . it was ...
explosive ordnance .
he ran into the coffee shop moments before
the secondary blast from the ruptured gas line .
well , it could have just been an accident .
so his wife is a witness , allen races into the blaze
and saves the most sympathetic person he can think of .
and becomes a hero to his wife .
hey , reid .
yeah , we got him , hotch .
have a seat .
what &apos;s this about ?
sit down .
i don &apos;t understand .
first i &apos;m in protective custody ,
now i &apos;m in an interrogation room ?
what the hell is going on ?
where is my husband ?
we heard you had a rough night .
a rough night . are you serious ?
the stress can be unbearable .
we can get you some water if you want .
i want to be with my daughter .
we almost died last night .
it &apos;s interesting that you didn &apos;t , though .
why do you think that is ?
most people &apos;s flight instincts would take over .
they &apos;d flee , setting off the bomb .
how did you know what to do ?
uh , i don &apos;t know .
i felt something click .
what clicked ? a remote ? a wire ?
no , the hairs on the back of my neck were standing up .
and i looked down and i saw something .
it--i didn &apos;t know what ,
but i thought the bomber might be coming after me
and i froze . i froze .
&quot; i didn &apos;t know what . &quot;
what ?
that was the lie , allen . you &apos;re not even good at hiding it .
you swallowed before you said it
and you looked over my shoulder when you did .
so because i need a glass of water , i &apos;m guilty ?
if you &apos;re not guilty ,
then why did you hide grant &apos;s books ?
he &apos;s not even denying it .
i am denying it .
not that i had the books , that i did anything .
he pulled out the books
after the explosion .
he said he ... wanted to understand what nearly killed him .
who prompted that conversation ?
what do you mean ?
did he show you the books and explain them ,
or did you find them ?
oh , no , i found them and asked about it .
what ?
well , why did allen hide the books
if he was so open about them ?
no , he asked me to hide the books ,
because ...
he want there to be any confusion
when you came to interview us .
what is it ?
trust your gut .
has allen been acting odd lately ?
look , he &apos;s been working a lot of late nights .
that &apos;s not what his work told us .
i &apos;m not saying anything else until i see my husband .
why did you hide your nighttime activities from your wife ?
you want to know what we think ?
not really , no .
you lived in grant &apos;s shadow for far too long .
you had a thing for brenda , you saw that he was interested ,
and you knew you didn &apos;t stand a chance .
how could you ? he was a hero .
and you watched them fall in love ,
get married , have a daughter .
you watched them live the life that you wanted .
and then he died .
so you waited .
you waited for the perfect opportunity
to prey on brenda &apos;s vulnerability .
and you thought it worked .
you know what ?
she never loved you .
no . that &apos;s not true .
she--she loves me .
listen to yourself . you don &apos;t even believe it .
how are we supposed to ?
i love my wife .
we believe that much is true .
we saw evidence of it when
you tried to keep grant &apos;s daughter--
my daughter .
and brenda away from your truck .
but answer this .
when the bomb went off at the coffee shop
and you were directly across the street ,
why did you leave her there ?
you would only do that
if you knew she wasn &apos;t in danger .
because you had planted the bomb .
but you didn &apos;t plan on the gas line rupturing ,
which actually put her in danger ,
you just wanted to be a hero .
like grant .
except you &apos;re not a hero , allen .
you &apos;re just a coward .
then why did i kill all those people ? !
you have all the answers .
why did i kill all those people ?
well , that was way too easy .
yes , it was .
it doesn &apos;t make sense that
allen would risk hurting brenda .
he values her too much .
reid said he was legitimately scared at his house .
you can &apos;t fake fear like that .
the bomb in archer &apos;s truck
was planted by somebody else .
a second unsub .
do you think allen pissed off a partner
who decided to take him out ?
only one way to find out .
we know you planted the bomb at the coffee shop
because you wanted to be a hero ,
but you had nothing to do
with the one at your house last night . who did ?
i have no idea .
a partner ?
no , i worked alone .
he &apos;s lying .
i &apos;m not .
why would you plant a bomb
that would put your wife and child at risk ?
you wouldn &apos;t .
so you either had a partner or--
you had nothing to do with the blast at the school .
you wouldn &apos;t . your house is in another district
and there are safer testing grounds .
you heard about it , so you decided to build
a bomb of your own to impress your wife .
yes .
and you killed 7 people in the process .
i never meant for that to happen .
oh , and i &apos;m sure that &apos;s gonna
help their families sleep much better at night .
why lie ?
because you were caught ?
the self @-@ sacrificial type , huh ?
shut up .
you took credit for somebody else &apos;s work .
and she hates you .
and the other bomber hates you
and now he wants to outdo you .
archer was a copycat .
the coffee shop bombing changes the profile .
we have to start over .
eliminate the coffee shop , what do we have ?
an unsub who set tnt in a high school boiler room
and nitroglycerin in the home of the man who stole his headlines .
in a boiler room that should have been empty .
he didn &apos;t want to kill anyone .
well , that certainly changed at the archer house .
he went for the biggest bang for his buck .
the death of the janitor at the high school
gave the unsub the urge to kill again .
that &apos;s the bombing we need to pay attention to .
we have a problem . someone leaked the location
of the truck bomb to the press .
headlines are all about allen again .
the media &apos;s calling on the mayor to
give him the key to the city .
obviously , the mayor isn &apos;t about to do that .
he has to .
what &apos;s your plan , aaron ?
do you want to be a hero ?
what are you talking about ?
do you want to be a real hero , like grant ?
got a chance for you to prove yourself .
you can &apos;t be serious .
believe me , if there were any other way ,
we wouldn &apos;t ask .
i can &apos;t see him again .
he nearly killed me and my daughter .
i can &apos;t lose her , too .
we will be right there to back you up .
no , i &apos;m not doing it .
you can &apos;t make me do that .
you &apos;re right .
you &apos;re right , i can &apos;t .
all i can do is ask you to trust us
and to help save lives ,
the same way grant did .
that is not fair .
i know it &apos;s not .
i can &apos;t believe you got the mayor to do this .
once we apprehend this guy , it will all have been his idea .
ahh , now it makes sense .
thank you for agreeing to help us .
i just hope you &apos;re right . otherwise i &apos;m going to look bad .
and i &apos;ll make sure you do , too .
excuse me .
and now i remember why i didn &apos;t go into politics .
oklahoma .
new york ,
langley ,
shanksville ,
boston ,
indianapolis .
i never wanted our great city to join that list .
but those who do evil
force us to face our fears and overcome them .
and we will overcome .
because of men like allen archer ,
men willing to stand up for what is right .
it is my proud honor to declare today
allen archer day .
please join me as i show allen
a sign of our appreciation
for his heroic bravery
in the face of hostility
by giving him a key to the circle city .
anything ?
nothing yet .
all clear here .
same here .
allen is an inspiration .
all too often ...
what have you got , garcia ?
some exceedingly curious information .
two weeks ago , there was a fire at an ethanol plant .
now , there were no casualties , but i found a connection
between the ethanol plant and the school .
what &apos;s the connection ?
last month a member of the school board
was fired for having sex with a student .
now , the student was over 18 , so no charges were filed ,
but the member of the school board
violated his contract like massively ,
so he was dismissed .
the sexy indiscretions happened
on the grounds of the ethanol plant .
who &apos;s the board member ?
james burke .
pretty active in the community
until the affair went public .
i &apos;m sending you his photo now .
thank you .
i say , here is our secret .
see us ...
bogey on east franklin .
we need to shut this down .
ipd , don &apos;t let that van breech the perimeter .
reid and jj , get the archers to safety .
dave , you get the mayor .
we are americans ,
and we defy you .
put the van in park !
i was told to park on main .
that &apos;s not gonna happen .
i said put it in park or i &apos;m gonna do it for you .
ok , ok .
and get out of the car slowly . let me see your hands .
slowly .
open the door .
both of them .
now back away . back away .
that &apos;s not him .
it &apos;s a bomb ! back away ! back away !
back away !
what the hell ?
get up .
who told you to bring the van here ?
some--some guy . he paid me 200 bucks to drive it .
this guy ?
yeah , yeah , that &apos;s him .
it &apos;s a decoy .
go to your secondary locations . he &apos;s here somewhere .
what the hell &apos;s going on ?
the bomber &apos;s here . we don &apos;t know where .
evacuate the area .
this is on you .
it &apos;s over , james .
i &apos;m the one with the bomb .
yes , you are .
you &apos;re not gonna use it .
why is that , then ?
you &apos;re a narcissist . you &apos;ve craved power your whole life .
and when you lost that , you snapped .
how could all those people you call friends
turn their backs on you ?
you didn &apos;t even do anything wrong , james .
i didn &apos;t .
she was 18 . it &apos;s not even illegal .
how could they fire you over that ?
how could they ruin your life ?
so you planted a bomb ,
burned down one of the schools
so the new board would panic .
only you accidentally took a life .
and then you realized the only way
anyone would ever notice you
is if you killed again .
i should set this off and take you out with me .
you &apos;re not gonna do that .
because you think you are god .
and gods don &apos;t die .
you will die if you detonate that , james .
and then you will never have the chance to take credit
for the bombs you did build .
put down the bomb
so we can tell everyone what you did and why .
let &apos;s go .
so how &apos;d you know he &apos;d head to the basement ?
well , the fire at the ethanol plant and at the school
both happened in the electrical rooms .
i apologize for earlier .
thank you for trusting us .
i just want you to know how much it meant to me
that you would do this .
i didn &apos;t do it for you .
brenda .
i just wanted to say thank you .
i know this wasn &apos;t easy ,
and we couldn &apos;t have done this without you .
but the good thing about being a mom ,
you &apos;ll always be her hero .
mommy !
&quot; true heroism is remarkably sober . very undramatic .
&quot; it is not the urge to surpass others at whatever cost ,
but the urge to serve others at whatever cost . &quot;
arthur ashe .
you ever gonna finish this game ?
it &apos;s a tough one .
playing yourself can be difficult .
playing a ghost even more so .
he &apos;s gone , spencer .
keeping the game going won &apos;t change that .
i know . i just thought
that maybe i could keep part of him alive
if his last game never ended .
neither side will ever win playing like this .
he hated good @-@ byes .
gideon also hated unfinished business .
so ...
let &apos;s finish it .
what are you doing ?
moving my rook .
do you know how to play chess ?
who do you think gideon played before he met you ?
i &apos;m probably gonna finish it in 5 moves .
check .
