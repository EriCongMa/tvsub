Jay, I'm home.
Did Manny call?
No, because he's fine.
It was a slumber party, not a gang fight.
I just want him to fit in.
I'm gonna take a shower. Do you care to join me?
You know, honey, there's a gun in the footlocker in the garage.
If I ever say no to that question,
I want you to use it on me.
Miss Mary Mack, Mack, Mack.
All dressed in black, black, black.
Shh, shh.
What's wrong?
With silver buttons, buttons, buttons.
All down her back, back, back.
Why aren't they trying to hurt each other?
I don't know, but I'm afraid to move.
You're really good at this.
Thanks.
What is happening, Claire?
What do you think?
Now, that is a scone.
No butter. Nonfat.
Shut up.
I'm gonna go check on Lily.
Surprise!
Mom!
What's that?
Sounds like a bird hit the window.
Oh, God. That's a bad sign.
Ow! That hurt, jerk!
Ow! I'm gonna kill you, stupid!
What happened?
Now I'm sad.
Hi, honey. Mmm!
Hi. I, uh-
I- I didn't know you were in town. You didn't call.
Well, I couldn't wait to see your new baby. Where is she?
Mitchell, who was that?
It's my mom.
Oh, yeah, right,
'cause the last time she was here,
the refrigerator magnets rearranged themselves into a penta...
Grandma!
第一季第四集
Mom. Mom, what are you doing to her legs?
Tai chi. I did it every day in Sedona.
Cameron, you should try it.
Mitchell's mother has a problem...
with me.
Last Christmas, for example,
she gave me a piece of exercise equipment and a lettuce dryer.
So, to recap,
I gave her a gorgeous pair of diamond earrings,
and she gave me a hint.
And living in Sedona has been transformational.
I get up every morning, and I go to a Vortex meditation site...
and work with a shaman to
finally understand how to live my spirituality.
Yikes.
And I've learned that
the only way I can move to the next level of my awakening...
is if we all can somehow...
get past...
the incident.
Oh, no.
The incident.
Oh, boy.
I would like to congratulate Jay and the lovely Gloria.
I'm very happy for them.
I wanted a big, beautiful wedding with Jay...
because my ex-husband and I got married...
in a tiny little office of a judge in Colombia.
My mother wanted to go to the wedding
to show everyone how okay she was with all of it,
so I convinced Dad and Gloria to invite her.
Who warned you that that was the worst idea ever?
Anyone?
Anyone?
Of course, I've-I've moved on.
I was supposed to come with a date,
but he just hurt his back,
which is very ironic because he's young and-and healthy.
My mom started drinking...
these cocktails called "Horny Colombians..."
with some of Gloria's uncles,
whom apparently the drink was named after.
Oh, come on. They were funny.
They kept patting my butt.
Somebody's full of herself.
It's a- It's a Colombian wedding tradition, they said.
I would like to make a toast.
Yeah. Nanna got totally wasted.
Uh, it was really funny.
Then it was gross.
To the bride and the groom- my ex.
Thirty-five years we were together,
and he couldn't wait 10 minutes to run off with Charo.
That's a joke.
Seriously, I knew they were perfect for each other...
when I saw his wallet and her boobs.
Take your hands off me!
Mom. Mom.
Oh, relax, Mitchell.
What, did you take your Claire pill?
No, no.
Let's just go get a little fresh air, okay?
And then it got weird.
I'm Gloria! I'm Gloria!
I got her.
Kiss me! Oh, hey, kiss me!
No! Oh, geez.
Nanna is really strong.
Ayayayayay! Ooh! Ayayayayay!
During my vows to my first husband,
drug dealers burst in and assassinated the judge.
This was way worse.
What can I say? I drive women crazy.
It's too soon, I guess.
Everybody is going to be there, Mom!
I don't care.
Your father and I are not about to let you
drive two hours to go to a concert...
and then spend the night with a bunch of boys,
especially that 17-year-old hormone you're dating.
It's totally supervised.
Oh, really? By whom?
By Spencer Patine's uncle.
Who's Spencer Patine?
You know Spencer- the guy with the arm.
Wait. What kind of arm?
What is that even mean?
His uncle is Uncle Toby.
Oh, Uncle Toby. I'll be sure to include that in my Amber Alert.
通过媒体向社会发布的警报]
Oh, my God!
Okay. Can I step in here?
I think I can help.
Haley, what your mom is worried about...
is you getting your heart broken
when Dylan goes off to college next year.
He's not going to college.
That's not what I'm-
He's not going to college?
He's in a band, okay? They're going on tour.
Oh, this just gets better and better.
Why are you always on me about everything?
Because you need to understand...
Okay. Everybody, calm down!
Let's start from the beginning.
What's wrong with Spencer's arm?
Mom, I'm home!
Ay, baby! Did you have fun at the slumber party?
You must be exhausted.
No, I'm not tired at all.
I was the first one to fall asleep.
What's on your face?
A smile from having such a good time with my friends.
No. Come here.
Look.
That's why they were laughing.
I thought it was my funny take on current events.
Why would they do something like that?
Don't worry about it.
Guys pull pranks like that all the time.
You just gotta prank 'em back.
You just gotta show 'em
you're willing to give as good as you get.
What do you think?
Revenge.
I like it.
Well, Mom, instead of dredging up the whole incident,
maybe we should just try and repress it,
like a- like a normal family.
I can't. I need closure.
I'm about to embark on a new journey.
I met a man.
Really?
His name is Chas,
and he's asked me to come live with him in his foreign land.
Wow. Where?
Canada.
You're moving to-to Canada?
French Canada.
That's wonderful.
It is wonderful.
It's just that when I think of all the awful things...
that I said to Gloria and Jay and you and Claire,
I feel such guilt.
Give it time, and see Banff.
Cam, please.
I just can't give myself to him sexually.
Okay. Mom.
Did not see that coming.
Oh, oh. Don't get me wrong.
We satisfy each other down there-
Oh! Can't..
Don't wanna-
That's why I need everyone's forgiveness.
I need your help, Mitchell.
Did you hear that, Mitchell?
Your mom needs your help to make love to her new man, Chas.
That's not weird at all.
Mom, I-
I'm just not really sure what you're asking me to do, Mom.
Well, everyone's mad at me.
Maybe you could pave the way so that I can apologize.
Well, um, you know,
we are actually all supposed to have Sunday dinner tonight,
so maybe I could go around and ask everyone
if it's okay for you to join us.
Oh! I knew I could count on you.
Oh, my beautiful boy. Mmm.
I love you so much.
There's a fish in nature
that swims around with its babies in its mouth.
That fish would look at Mitchell's relationship with his mother...
and say, "that's messed up."
Boy-
Things with your mom got pretty intense down there, huh?
All like East Coast-West Coast. You feelin' me?
Act like a parent, talk like a peer.
I call it "Peerenting."
I learned it from my own dad, who used to walk into my room...
and say, "what's up, sweathog?"
Honey, I would love to let you go to the concert.
Are you kidding me? I think concerts are rad.
Hello? I was a Hall-Raiser.
A what?
I followed Hall & Oates around the country one summer.
"Rich Girl" Just spoke to me.
I was dating this girl. Not- Not dating.
I guess I was following her too, kind of-
Okay, Mom just doesn't trust me, and it's not fair.
She trusts you. It's just that weird stuff happens at concerts.
Boys get urges.
Ew.
Dad, is there something you want?
Yes, there is- to connect with this girl right here.
Now, come on. Pretend I'm not your dad.
We're just a couple of friends kickin' it in a juice bar.
What's a juice bar?
Okay, a malt shop. Whatever.
Dad, I don't...
No. Who's Dad?
Who's Dad? I'm- I'm Marcus from Biology.
Hey, Haley. How's it going with you and Dylan?
Has he tried anything inappropriate with you?
Girl.
Hey.
What are you doing?
I don't know. Nothing.
Just talking to some dork I met in a malt shop.
Hey, Mitchell. What's up?
Hey! Just in the hood.
Do you- Do you remember how Mom gave up a career to raise us?
Promising career.
Oh, God.
Claire?
Mom.
Why so long?
I know, I know. It's weird when we haven't talked for a while.
I mean your hair.
Well, if I can't tell you, who will?
So, Mom wants you to know
that she's very sorry about the incident,
and-and she wants us to forgive her.
How very nice of her to say that through you.
Do you see?
The sarcasm is so hurtful, like a whip.
You know how growing up,
we all have that voice inside our head...
that tells us we're not good enough?
Well, mine was outside my head,
driving me to school.
Uh, so- so anyway,
Mom really wants to smooth everything over with Dad and Gloria.
So I was thinking, uh, would it be okay
if she maybe joined us for dinner tonight?
Because it may be the last time you ever see me.
Well...
Okay. Wait, Mom.
What are you talking about?
Well, I'm- I'm moving...
to a far and dangerous place.
Canada. But, uh, she met a man named Chas.
Yeah.
He's a logger.
Uh, like a lumberjack?
No, he logs blood samples into a cholesterol study.
Anyway, until I'm past this whole wedding debacle,
I can't be intimate with him.
We do things to each other.
We use our hands.
Oh, my Lord.
Hey, Nanna.
Oh, my little comet!
Oh, look at you. You're all grown up.
Hmm. Tell Mom that.
She won't even let me go to a concert.
Overnight, with her boyfriend.
What are you laughing at?
Oh, karma's a funny thing, that's all.
Remember Ricky?
Oh, God.
Ooh. Who's Ricky?
No one.
Ricky was your mother's boyfriend,
and he looked like Charles Manson.
And one night, she didn't come home until 4:00 in the morning.
4:00. Wow. Wow. Mom, what were you and Ricky doing?
Nothing. We were doing nothing,
and he was a very sweet boy,
which you might have known if you bothered to get to know him.
Dylan's a sweet boy.
Dylan. Dylan isn't Ricky.
Ricky- Ricky was a poet.
Dylan writes songs.
Awesome songs.
And maybe you would know that
"If you bothered to get to know him."
Okay, you know? First of all, I am not my mother.
I don't judge people before I get a chance to know them.
So you invite Dylan over to dinner tonight,
and if he's as sweet and as kind as you say he is,
then I have no problem considering letting you go to the concert,
after I do a background check on Uncle Toby.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Mom.
I'm gonna go call him!
That's very revealing.
That's my parenting style.
No, I meant your blouse.
Mom!
Claire, wait. Come...
Not making this easy.
Claire, come on. Stop, stop, stop.
Just let her come to dinner, apologize to Dad and Gloria,
and she and Chas can live happily ever after.
In Canada.
In Canada.
Wait. Why don't you make her fix this,
instead of you doing it as usual?
Whoa. What's that supposed to mean?
Mom makes a mess, and there's Mitchell to clean it up.
That is so not true.
If anything,
you're the one with the screwed-up relationship with Mommy-
With Mom.
Wow.
"Mommy"!
No, I didn't say it-
Damn it.
Ooh. Fine. Fine.
She can come, but she's gotta clear it with Daddy.
"Daddy"?
I did not say "Daddy."
You said "Daddy."
Hey, Dad.
Mitchell, what are you doing here?
Uh, I'm sorry to bother you.
Can I talk to you and Gloria for a second?
She's out dealing with a Manny situation.
He set a kid's bike on fire.
Why?
Oh, I might have told him to get even with some kids,
and he went all Rambo with it.
Not my best parenting moment.
Not your worst.
What's up?
Uh, well, you know, uh, Mom's in town.
Your mom?
No, your mom. She's back from the grave.
Yes. Yes, my mom, Dad.
My mom would be less scary.
Listen, she's a wreck about what happened at the wedding,
and she wants to come to dinner tonight to apologize to everyone.
Still her little errand boy, I see.
No- Why does everybody keep saying- No.
I- I'm just trying to piece this family back together.
So, you'll talk to Gloria about Mom coming to dinner?
Oh, Gloria would never go for that in a million years.
She's still furious with your mother,
which is why I'm not talking to you.
What did I do?
This conversation never took place.
That's not very nice.
I drove all the way here.
No, you didn't. You were never here.
You never even called.
I would've called,
but I thought it would be better-
What's happening here?
Listen, I would love to get this thing behind us,
but Gloria would never forgive me
if I pulled a fast one on her.
That's why you're going to pull a fast one on her,
and I'm not going to like it one bit.
Okay, that's just great.
No, that's great. So, it's all up to me.
I can't hear you because you're back home, and I'm taking a nap.
D-Money! There he is.
Hey.
Come on in.
Hey.
Hi.
How you doing?
Good.
Um- Uh, hey, everybody.
This is Dylan.
Hey.
Hi, Dylan.
Hey.
He has a very gentle soul.
You got that from "Hey"?
So, Dylan, see you brought the ax.
Yeah, yeah. I just came from practice.
Sweet.
Miss those days.
Oh, you were in a band?
Could have been, but in high school
I was really all about my magic, so-
Oh, my God. Over.
Oh, that's gonna be Dad and Gloria.
Oh, Mitchell.
I know it's silly, but...
I'm a little nervous.
Oh. That's not silly. You should be.
Hola. Hola.
How are you?
Manny?
Phil.
Nice mustache.
Thank you.
Don't make fun. He may burn your house down.
Oh, boy.
Dede.
Hi, Jay, Gloria.
What is she doing here?
What does she mean, "What is she doing here?"
Mitchell told you I'd be here.
Lies!
I couldn't tell her, because she wouldn't come.
Gloria, uh, my mom wants to apologize for everything.
So you just spring it on Gloria like this?
Mitchell, what the hell is wrong with you?
I don't want her apologies.
Who could blame you, honey?
Which is why this is a terrible idea by you!
Jay. Manny. Let's go.
Oh, wait, wait, Gloria.
I- I just want to tell you
how sorry I am for ruining your wedding.
I was struggling with being alone.
Meanwhile, Jay moves on so easily,
and-and not with just anyone-
with a...
young...
and smart and beautiful woman.
I don't expect you to forgive me.
If I were you, I'd want to punch me right in the mouth.
I think we've had enough revenge in this family for one day.
Ah. Okay. Y- You see?
Yeah, we're all gonna move past this, and because of me,
who's not a mama's boy, but is
a caring person with wisdom and emotional insight.
So make a note, bitches.
It's not a good color on you.
I forgive you.
I am not prepared for this.
I just-
I- I wanna
rip your head off!
What?
What are you doing?
You ruined my wedding!
Oh, no!
Oh! I got Gloria!
I got Gloria!
Mom, come on.
Unbend your legs.
I got Gloria.
Stand up like a big girl. Come on.
All right. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it, the two of you.
I am so sorry about this.
No, it's cool. It's cool.
This is ridiculous. Gloria didn't steal me,
Dede, and you know it.
We grew apart for years,
and you left to find yourself, remember?
I thought I could handle this.
I'm so sorry.
You don't say sorry anymore!
That word means nothing in your mouth!
I got Gloria.
I don't know what just happened.
I do.
I mean, it seems pretty simple to me.
You're reaching out, trying to hold on to something awesome.
Um, maybe- maybe you shouldn't...
Look, look, look. I'm not used to this-
the whole big family thing.
In my house, we don't even talk to each other.
You know, it's funny- the first time I saw Haley,
I knew I liked her.
I mean, she's beautiful and everything,
but it's-it's not just that.
It's that she's got this killer confidence-
you know, the kind of confidence
that you get from having a family like this...
that's passionate...
and accepting of hot foreigners...
and gay dudes and nutty people.
You know,
a family that actually loves each other.
I can't believe I'm gonna say this,
but maybe we should let her go with him.
He's perfect.
Everybody, Haley says that Dylan is a musician,
and he writes some great songs.
Yeah.
Play something, bro.
Well, I guess so, if you want me to.
We could all use a nice tune right now.
This is, uh, actually a song I wrote for Haley.
It's called "In the Moonlight."
Lovely title, Dylan.
Thanks.
