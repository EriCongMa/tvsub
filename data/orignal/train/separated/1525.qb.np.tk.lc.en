mom , come on , i need to get to school !
isn &apos;t it today senior ditch day ?
today &apos;s ditch day ?
no way you are ditching ditch day .
it &apos;s like the best week of senior year ... day .
unlike this house ,
the library will be completely quiet
so i can focus on my roommate selection .
how long can picking a nerdy roommate take ?
they &apos;re all versions of you .
look -- indian you , blonde you , asian you .
oh , look ! her name is actually &quot; yu . &quot;
skipping one day of school isn &apos;t gonna do any harm .
i ditched plenty , and look at me today .
i am fielding multiple job offers .
one job offer .
from a very prominent hotel chain
weighed against the implied offer of staying at my current job .
working for you dad .
exactly ! and i could never leave grandpa ,
so i am going to say &quot; no &quot; to the first offer --
only offer .
even though i would have made an excellent
regional vice president in charge of promotions .
she is great at promotion .
that title gets longer every time i hear it .
come on , don &apos;t go to school .
girls &apos; day ! we &apos;ll swing by the mall .
you could use a new everything .
girls , get in the car . luke &apos;s hurt .
oh , my god . what happened ?
he collapsed on the way to school .
he &apos;s in the hospital . come on .
what &apos;s wrong with luke ? why &apos;d he collapsed ?
i heard he was dead !
you care about me .
got &apos; em good , buddy .
nobody &apos;s dead !
look out !
oh , sorry !
are you out of your mind ? !
alex , you have worked so insanely hard this year .
you deserve this ditch day more than anyone .
so guess what ?
we &apos;re going to california adventure .
without mom !
ditch day ! ditch day ! ditch day !
is this a high holiday for you people ?
that &apos;s it . i &apos;m doing it .
i &apos;m throwing out all my socks and starting over .
and they say tina was brave for leaving ike .
oh , god . that hurts .
oh , my gosh . you cut yourself .
don &apos;t get blood in my eggs .
we &apos;re getting concerned
that lily hasn &apos;t developed an adequate sense of empathy .
insofar as she doesn &apos;t have any at all .
okay , that &apos;s good . i can feel that working .
i know . i can finally breathe .
i can &apos;t hear myself think !
nice preview of our sunset years .
she literally pulled the plug on us .
i wasn &apos;t gonna mention the other job offer to my dad ,
but i didn &apos;t want him just hearing about it ,
so after wrestling with it all day , i decided to tell him .
hey , you &apos;re in early .
are you ready to have a laugh ?
janice &apos;s haircut ?
give her some slack .
she just went through a breakup ...
with a woman , i assume , based on the haircut .
no , it &apos;s even funnier .
uh , so you know how hard i &apos;ve been working on
the grand royal hotel account ?
not giving raises till next year , but go on .
they offered me a job .
crazy , right ?
yeah .
yeah .
i mean , maybe not &quot; crazy , &quot;
but trying to poach the boss &apos;s daughter ?
i must have impressed &apos; em .
you gotta take this offer .
what ?
higher salary , better benefits .
i mean , you might have to travel more ,
which is time away from phil .
nothing but upside .
he was right .
it was a great opportunity .
i may have been a bit hasty
turning down that job offer so quickly .
do you think you could give me a day or two to think about it ?
yes , it would mean leaving my dad ,
but this was business .
it wasn &apos;t personal .
plus , clearly my father doesn &apos;t care if i live or die .
hey , will i still get wise without my wisdom teeth ?
you get it ?
every time .
why don &apos;t i hold on to the painkillers ?
now i &apos;m sad .
they &apos;re right here .
i &apos;ll give you one when you need one .
no , kylie said she &apos;d meet me at the dentist
and she never came .
ay , i know , papi , i &apos;m so sorry ,
but i &apos;m gonna get you a very nice pillow from your bedroom .
she wants me to go away with her to drama camp this summer ,
and then she doesn &apos;t even show up today ?
maybe kylie changed her mind about camp .
maybe she plans to be with many men
and she doesn &apos;t deserve you .
i hid it very well from manny ,
but i hated that girl .
she was getting too serious too fast .
i &apos;m so sorry .
my volleyball practice went long
and then my phone died .
i want to kiss you , but i have surgery breath .
just make sure you &apos;re back in kissing shape
in time for us to go to camp together .
why do i keep smelling strawberries ?
what did they do to me ?
it &apos;s the milkshake i brought you .
oh , and look .
i usually wait till you &apos;re not looking , then i look .
the scarf you gave me , you dog !
actually , now &apos;s a good time to look
&apos;cause i kinda see four of them .
i got a couple pills in me .
ditch day . ditch day . ditch day .
ditch ...
15 minutes .
when you didn &apos;t stop while we were getting gas ,
i thought it might just go on forever .
sweet myrna loy !
dad , you know it &apos;s not
a movie called &quot; demolition notice , &quot; right ?
i built this theater with these two hands ...
plus the 28 hands of 14 other guys .
you ... built this .
renovated it .
before i got into real estate , i worked construction .
you .... worked construction .
yeah , stop staying it like that .
i put 10 months of my life into this place .
i &apos;d love to look around one last time
before they tear the old girl down .
oh , well , sucks to be getting old .
you know what ? we &apos;re bustin &apos; in .
how ? smash a window with a brick ?
i had something a little more elegant in mind .
i think you forget that i gave birth to this building .
i know her strengths ...
and ... her weaknesses .
did you see a brick ?
so i walked into to dad &apos;s office ,
and he is holding a picture of me ,
looking at it with tears welling in his eyes .
oh , dad was never that emotional when we were growing up .
i know . that &apos;s what makes this whole thing so hard !
maybe lily hasn &apos;t learned empathy
because she hasn &apos;t seen it from me , you know ?
could we maybe stay on my problem until the bread comes ?
i &apos;m sorry . it sounded like you were done . sorry .
so , the way i left things with the hotel company
is that i need a little more time to decide ,
but honestly , i think i &apos;m gonna tell &apos; em no .
i mean , how could i leave dad after what i saw ?
it &apos;s just -- it &apos;s heartbreaking .
oh , i could cry .
thank you .
maybe if lily saw me cry ,
she would see that it &apos;s okay to be that way ,
especially coming from me , her stoic dad who never cries .
oh , come on , you had to be done that time .
you know what ? you &apos;re right . let &apos;s do you .
your problem is bigger than mine anyway ,
&apos;cause if your plan is to cry in front of lily ...
forget it .
you &apos;re too emotionally constipated .
you know , i @-@ i know you &apos;re joking , claire ,
but sometimes ... sometimes words hurt , you know ?
and to think that my own sister ...
my own sister would accuse me of -- oh , screw it .
i &apos;ll just work up some tears with a sad movie . it &apos;s fine .
mom ?
you &apos;re awake .
how you feeling ?
you bought me a balloon .
what ?
and a teddy bear .
when did you buy all this stuff ?
when -- when you were asleep
and i got you a strawberry milkshake .
mom , you &apos;re the best .
he couldn &apos;t remember a thing .
all i had to do was to get him past the 5 : 00 deadline
so that he couldn &apos;t go on that trip with kylie .
i know what happens at camp .
i &apos;ve seen &quot; meatballs . &quot;
i still can &apos;t believe kylie flaked on me .
i thought she really liked me .
i guess not .
time for more pills , baby .
really ? i &apos;m already so loopy .
we have to get ahead of the pain .
maybe she texted me .
have you seen my phone ?
is it over there ?
i don &apos;t see it .
what are you doing ?
eh ... hugging !
you &apos;re so sweet .
but i don &apos;t think these pills are really doing anything .
does this place look familiar ?
oh , yeah . this is where we were all murdered .
no , silly . this is where you girls saw your first movie .
halfway through &quot; hare @-@ abian nights , &quot;
i looked over , and your little heads were pressed together
like the cutest teepee ever .
and where was i during all of this family fun ?
buddy , the three of us were having a girls &apos; day .
you get it .
this way . over here by the screen .
so ...
while i was still building this place ,
i snuck back here with you guys after work one day , and ...
check it out .
aw , dad ! are those our feet ?
look at how tiny !
where &apos;s my footprints ?
um ... i guess that &apos;s you . anyway ...
that looks like a baby head .
i was struggling with these two .
you were all squirmy .
i &apos;m not gonna apologize over and over .
come on , let &apos;s grab this thing .
grab what , the cement ?
this place is gonna be rubble in a few days .
i want a memento .
let &apos;s do it !
all right , well , this seems more like boys &apos; work ,
so you guys take your time on that , okay ?
super fun adventure !
okay , so that &apos;s at least an hour .
there &apos;s a mall across the street .
i &apos;m calling a car and going to school .
caltech needs my roommate selection by --
what &apos;s your problem ?
what &apos;s yours ? you &apos;re just gonna leave without telling dad ?
you were just about to take me to a mall .
okay , if you can &apos;t see the difference ...
look , i &apos;m sorry i &apos;ve got better things to do
than go shop or sit in some creepy old movie theater
where we used to watch cartoons .
i get it . you &apos;re beyond all of us now .
go pick out your playmates at nerd academy .
fine .
i &apos;ll just pick out my roommate here then .
sorry i &apos;m so excited about college .
apology not accepted .
i wasn &apos;t actually apologizing , so ...
found the light !
found the chisel !
found the broom .
no , no .
mitchell ? what &apos;s wrong ?
i feel like lily &apos;s inability to show feelings
for other people might be my fault .
oh , honey .
i think that , too , but just take comfort in knowing
you got there on your own .
i &apos;m watching &quot; the bridges of madison county &quot;
because it &apos;s the only thing that makes me cry .
when she gets home ,
i &apos;m going to turn this off and pretend i was reading this .
&quot; typhoon flattens orphanage &quot; ?
yeah , that &apos;s sad , right ?
now -- now get out of here ,
because she &apos;s going to be home any second ,
and i &apos;m trying to stay sad .
wait . wait , wait , wait , wait . just to clarify ,
the only thing that makes you cry ...
that truly resonates with you on a deep , emotional level
is a film about someone ... who &apos;s trapped in a loveless marriage ?
okay , cam , please go .
i &apos;m starting not to feel anything .
do you know how hurtful that is ?
i &apos;m home !
and now i &apos;m not crying . great .
hey , sweetie . hi . how was your day ?
better than hers . what &apos;s wrong now ?
daddy &apos;s just having a moment .
he &apos;s always having a moment .
oh , wait . oh , my gosh . i @-@ i just realized something .
what , that our marriage bed
is a 1,200 thread @-@ count charade ?
no , maybe this isn &apos;t my fault .
maybe lily can &apos;t show empathy because you &apos;re always crying .
oh , so it &apos;s my fault ?
yes .
you &apos;ve totally desensitized her to normal emotions .
that &apos;s not true !
and now you wanna cry ,
because she won &apos;t cry because you &apos;re always crying .
and you would only know that
because you do love me !
hi , honey . what &apos;s up ?
well , i just wanted to let you know
i turned down that hotel job offer .
how come ?
some things are just more important than money ,
and for me that includes my fam--
man , that smarts .
what are you doing ?
just trimming the hedges .
i saw a low @-@ angle photo of me the other day .
i looked like a snorted a rabbi .
and -- and -- and you &apos;re using
a picture of me as your mirror ?
oh , it is you !
hey , is that my phone ?
ah , yes !
i found it while you were asleep .
um , let me put it back in your bedroom until you wake up .
oh , kylie texted me .
she sent me a photo of me and her .
sitting right here .
oh , maybe she sneak in
while i was getting you all those nice stuff .
but you &apos;re behind me ,
staring at us with a terrible look on your face .
oh , that &apos;s impossible . i never take a bad picture .
are you trying to sabotage my relationship with kylie ?
her clothes are too tight , her heels are too high ,
she &apos;s so loud , and --
and i hate how she smothers you !
oh , my god . you &apos;re describing yourself .
no ! my clothes are not that ...
my heels are ...
i am not ... loud .
i &apos;m dating my mother !
oh , gross .
excuse me ?
i used to like her , but now it &apos;s ruined .
please . there are worse things than dating your own mother .
like what ?
you know what ? i don &apos;t like this attitude ,
and i am sure that kylie won &apos;t like it either .
maybe you do need somebody like her
to keep you in line while i am not around .
what are you doing ?
i am sending your application to drama camp .
we still have two minutes .
mom , don &apos;t you dare .
okay , name , age ...
street name ? like you &apos;re in a gang ?
i don &apos;t want to go to camp with kylie now !
it &apos;s disgusting !
oh , look . we got another text from ky--
she send a picture of her in a bikini !
she did ?
you -- you can just go ahead and hit &quot; send . &quot;
no . you &apos;re not going to go to camp with a girl like that .
oh , my god . mom , you &apos;re crazy !
yes . no . yes . no .
you hate every single girl i like .
you have to start letting me make my own decisions ,
or everything everybody says about me is true--
i &apos;m a giant mama &apos;s boy .
do they really call you that ?
yes . now is that what you want ?
okay , fine .
if you want to go , go .
thank you .
i have that same bikini .
okay , we &apos;re gonna need a crow bar
or something to lift this thing .
you look back there , and i &apos;ll check these shelves .
anything up there ?
not a thing , buddy .
i feel like i saw some sort of a--
are they aware ... ?
not a chance .
maybe we can use this broom handle to pry it loose .
no , that won &apos;t work . oh , no .
yes , it will .
come on !
that was close .
sorry i was a jerk earlier .
i &apos;m actually having a lot of fun
watching cartoons with you again .
it was my fault . i &apos;m just a little ...
are you ever gonna call me ?
what ?
it &apos;s just something i &apos;ve--
i &apos;ve been wondering about , you know .
like , we live together ,
so you don &apos;t have to call me ,
and once you &apos;re off at brainy school ,
surrounded by a bunch of brainy brains ...
are we gonna be friends ?
what are you talking about ? you &apos;re my sister .
oh , right . yeah , sisters .
like , we &apos;re obligated to see each other on thanksgiving ,
christmas ...
luke &apos;s funeral .
i &apos;m fine !
&quot; uh @-@ oh &quot; what ?
nothing .
what did you do ?
i was following your orders .
i &apos;m surprised you didn &apos;t ask me to stand on top
and saw around myself in a circle .
why do we even need this stupid thing ?
because they &apos;re tearing down the only thing i &apos;ve ever built .
just stand there . we can still do is .
yeah , it &apos;s great being a real estate agent ,
my face is on billboards and pens .
i have a balloon budget .
but none of it ever lasts .
once this place is gone ,
they &apos;re won &apos;t be anything i can point to and say ,
&quot; i made that . &quot;
what did you do ?
what does it look like ? !
i sprung a leak !
there &apos;s gotta be a water shut @-@ off !
haley ...
i &apos;m sorry if i &apos;ve been acting like
i didn &apos;t wanna hang out with you lately .
or ... ever .
don &apos;t worry about it .
i &apos;m not worried .
we &apos;ll probably be even closer
once we &apos;re not actually caged in together .
i &apos;ll be calling you all the time .
think about it--
i &apos;m about to live on a campus full of alexes .
that &apos;s bound to get annoying .
and when it does , who better to deal with an alex than you ?
i made that .
hey , you wanted to see me ?
just got off the phone with dan signer .
who ?
he &apos;s one of the big mucks at the grand royal hotels .
they &apos;re thinking about dropping our account .
something about you turning down the job offer .
well ... and then accepting it ,
and then turning it down , and then accepting it again .
why are you jerking him around ?
you &apos;re worse than claudia .
who &apos;s claudia ?
janice &apos;s ex @-@ girlfriend .
she strung her along for eight years ,
now they &apos;re in a custody battle over two labradors .
am i the only one that got stuck in the break room
with her today ?
okay , dad , look . if it &apos;ll help ,
i &apos;ll call the hotel people and i &apos;ll straighten all this out .
i don &apos;t think more calls from you is the answer ,
and by the way ,
i don &apos;t think you &apos;re gonna get that job anymore .
fine ! i don &apos;t care ! i don &apos;t care !
i never wanted that job in the first place !
well , then why did you tell me about it in the first place ?
because i wanted you to tell me not to take the job
because i &apos;m your daughter !
you know , the thing behind the mirror
that you ... trim your nose hairs with ?
don &apos;t you even care if i stay or go ?
of course i do .
well , you don &apos;t show it .
well , maybe because i didn &apos;t want that to be a factor .
it would kill me if i thought that what i felt
would hold you back from getting something that you wanted .
but trust me , when i saw that job offer ,
my heart almost fell out of my chest .
i love us working together !
thanks . okay , then .
&quot; okay , then &quot; ?
i pour my heart out , and that &apos;s all i get ?
one time my dad said , &quot; nice game , kid . &quot;
i had eye black streaming down my cheeks ,
but all i get is , &quot; okay , then &quot; ?
i mean , i @-@ i probably don &apos;t say it as much as i should ,
but i &apos;m proud of you , kid .
got it .
jay ?
hey , dan !
gee , i didn &apos;t think you &apos;d show up in person .
claire , this is the big cheese , dan signer .
hi , mr. signer . such a pleasure to meet you .
i &apos;m so sorry about all that back and forth today .
hey , i &apos;ll handle it from here .
dan , we love doing business with you ,
but i gotta put my foot down when it comes to claire .
this is my little baby girl here .
the best part of my day is having a coffee
with her in the break room ,
and it wasn &apos;t that long ago
that she was sitting at the breakfast table
eating heart @-@ shaped waffles that i made for her .
i tell ya , it puts a lump in your throat .
anyway , uh ,
i don &apos;t know how i got to be the luckiest s.o.b. alive ...
but if i have just even a few grains left in that hourglass ...
i &apos;m gonna be spending it with ...
i almost just called her by her childhood nickname there .
ah , what the hell ?
my little bunny foo @-@ foo .
oh , no .
let me walk you out , dan .
bunny !
thanks for coming .
bunny !
who &apos;s dan signer ?
i thought we were grabbing a beer at the club .
just keep walking , mel .
uh , lily , are you busy ?
depends .
well , we wanted to have a little talk about feelings .
oh , actually , i have this project due tomorrow --
okay , honey . no , no . it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay .
let &apos;s just sit down .
listen , we just wanted to ask if you think i cry too much .
and you can be honest .
i don &apos;t want to answer &apos; cause you might cry .
yeah , well ...
she cares about my feelings !
okay , lily , we think that maybe you don &apos;t get emotional
because daddy gets , you know , so emotional
because he kind of handles
the emotions for the entire house , you know ?
i do .
possibly the entire block .
okay .
and maybe that &apos;s why you don &apos;t feel anything .
i feel stuff .
really ? because when we were sick a few weeks ago ,
you didn &apos;t seem to care .
i didn &apos;t care .
well , she &apos;s not a liar . we did something right .
don &apos;t you think you should have cared a little bit ?
why ? you always get better .
well ... so far .
what do you mean , &quot; so far &quot; ?
um ... well , uh ...
like someday , you &apos;re not gonna get better ?
like you &apos;re gonna die ?
no ! no , no , no , no . not , not for a very , very long time .
then why are we talking about it now ?
well , hey , you brought it up .
i just wanted to make sure that --
stop ! you &apos;re making me sad !
okay , well , she has feelings .
well , yes , and it seems that she wants to keep us alive .
so all in all , a good day of parenting .
i don &apos;t want to live with aunt claire !
lily !
parents make so many mistakes with their children ...
i &apos;ve alive , sweetheart .
but what about daddy ?
i &apos;m alive , too .
come here . come on , sweetheart .
but it &apos;s only because we &apos;re trying so hard
to make them happy .
not her . not her . oh , my god .
you &apos;re gonna be the cutest girl at this whole school .
wait , these are girls , right ?
trying so hard to keep them close ...
you could knock .
even though we know we can &apos;t .
i know someday i &apos;m gonna lose you to another woman ,
and i &apos;ll find a way to be okay with it .
thanks , kylie .
but not today .
so , i walk into his office
he &apos;s looking at a picture of me
and he &apos;s crying .
your dad ?
yeah , i couldn &apos;t believe it either .
this is why i &apos;m glad that i show my emotions
in front of the girls .
i think that &apos;s the reason that feeling ...
phill ,
can we at least have my story
until the oven preheats ?
sorry , i thought you were finished .
okay , so , anyway , i went back later and it turns out
he wasn &apos;t crying ,
he was plucking his nose hairs .
i didn &apos;t expect that .
yeah , me neither .
to walk into that theatre and see
their cute little heads together
after they had been fighting all afternoon .
come on , you had to be done that time .
no , is it me ?
is it the way that i tell stories ?
am i so boring or is everyone in this family
that self @-@ involved .
as i was saying
her name was elena and she &apos;s from north carolina .
that &apos;s my roomate .
now i &apos;m done .
