is there a &quot; throw food in the cage and run &quot; category ?
hey , jump in .
we &apos;re playing &quot; marry , sleep with , or kill :
diner edition . &quot;
no , if i slept with anyone in this diner ,
i &apos;d kill myself .
even in a fictional scenario ,
i cannot permit myself to go there .
girl , you &apos;d take the fun out of the punch bowl full of cocaine .
okay , fine .
sleep with earl , marry you .
not us ! jeez .
what are you , a freak ?
i feel uncomfortable , caroline .
like , i don &apos;t know how to look at you anymore .
now , i can only see you in a creepy lady tux .
you said it was just a game !
i &apos;m not in love with you . back off !
it was just a joke , earl .
the things we say in jest , darling .
the things we say in jest .
oh , my god ,
look at the rsvp list for our opening party .
max &apos;s homemade cupcakes is at capacity .
hey , we might even be overbooked ,
because in my experience , even when guys
say they &apos;re not going to come , they do .
caroline , booth two has been waiting
for service for ten minutes !
and han knows how frustrating that is ,
&apos;cause he &apos;s been waiting to be serviced for years .
not that it &apos;s any of your business , max ,
but i have a very active sex life .
so then , han , will you be bringing a date tomorrow night ?
ah , no .
you do understand that sex involves two people , right ?
and that one of those people has to be you ?
what is all this dirty talk ?
this is a diner , not a dirty talking place .
sorry , han , i know we still work here at night .
i &apos;ll go right over to the booth .
we were just talking about our big opening party .
all you ever talk about is your big opening .
now who has the potty mouth ?
max , i need your guest list names .
oh , okay , i &apos;m still waiting for them to confirm ,
so just put me down for ten .
okay , but i need their names asap .
i &apos;m running a tight door .
i got a bouncer from a local club to donate his time .
i told him it was a charity event for eczema .
what ? we &apos;ll make a big donation when we &apos;re successful ,
but , for tomorrow , every now and then , scratch a little ?
hi , everybody ! i got great news .
what ? you finally found the thing we lost in there ?
no . i knew we should &apos;ve tied a string on it .
no , look . i got a fax from poland .
my dream house is done ! isn &apos;t it amazing ?
it is amazing .
i haven &apos;t seen a fax in , like , five years .
sophie , it &apos;s so pretty !
look at all this sweet gingerbread woodwork on the porch .
oh , i &apos;m so excited .
i &apos;m going to be on air poland flight right after big party .
you are going to poland ? that &apos;s news .
and when were you going to tell me ?
um , now , yeah .
um , i &apos;m going to be gone for a month .
oh , okay .
it will be good to have some time away
from the old ball and chain .
yah , he &apos;s not talking about me .
we use a ball and chain in our lovemaking .
that &apos;s the thing i can &apos;t find .
okay , yeah .
well , buh @-@ bye .
i &apos;ll see you tomorrow night at my big going away party !
sophie , the party &apos;s for our cupcake business .
oh , see , this is why i don &apos;t like you so much .
guys , thanks again for donating your time .
it &apos;s fundraisers like this that will help
put an end to undescended testicles .
h !
i &apos;d like to meet the owner of this awesome
and totally cool cupcake shop ?
oh , nevermind ! that &apos;s me .
max , you got a blow @-@ out !
yeah , i &apos;d figured i finally see
what all the fuss about getting blown is .
oh , hi , we &apos;re not quite ready for guests yet .
girl , i &apos;m your doorman , nevel .
oh , i &apos;m confused . i thought my doorman was--
straight , white , and boring ? he was .
then , boring came down with the flu .
now , you &apos;ve got gay , black , and definitely not boring .
so what &apos;s the charity tonight ?
eczema .
undescended testicles .
people with eczema and undescended testicles .
lord , child . that is a cross to bear .
get me the door list ,
and let &apos;s make those poor , itchy boys some money .
another fake charity ?
you &apos;ve got some balls , even if they aren &apos;t descended .
max , we so lucked out .
nothing says &quot; successful party &quot;
like a bitchy , gay doorman !
give me your guest names . i &apos;ll write them down .
okay , fine .
put down tommy , dylan , robbie , johnny--
robbie and johnny ?
wait , max , are these all your ex @-@ boyfriends ?
perhaps .
max , the invited guests
were all supposed to be business contacts .
see , this is why i didn &apos;t tell you sooner .
you &apos;re a control freak .
and for the record , these guys have all had contact
with my business .
you &apos;re using our launch party
to get back at ex @-@ boyfriends ?
uh , yeah !
that &apos;s what success is for ,
to say &quot; suck it &quot; to people who dumped you .
&quot; see my blown @-@ out hair ? suck it !
&quot; see my cool cupcake shop ? suck it !
see these in this blouse ? you wish you could suck it . &quot;
and here , it is not just boyfriends on my list .
i also invited the lady from staples
who gives me attitude .
she can suck it too .
fine , but how is inviting johnny
and his new wife a victory ?
oh , like this .
&quot; hi , mrs. johnny . nice to meet you .
you got him , but i got these
and all this , so suck it . &quot;
i &apos;m not so sure this is healthy .
are you kidding me ?
this is the healthiest thing i &apos;ve done in my life .
i even thought about inviting my mother to come and suck it ,
but then she &apos;d realize maybe i didn &apos;t commit suicide
two years ago like my note said .
i &apos;m about ready to open .
shouldn &apos;t we be putting up some testicle banners ,
or scrotum posters , or something ?
also , there &apos;s a cute blonde boy out here asking for you
that i &apos;m about to eat alive .
that &apos;s andy with the free bar stuff .
go , i &apos;m gonna stay here
and practice my &quot; suck it &quot; face for a while .
how &apos;s this ?
that look is so much more &quot; suck it &quot;
with the straight hair .
i know , right ?
there &apos;s my cute boyfriend . hey .
how did everything go at spike &apos;s liquor ?
well , i got a little bit confused
about what charity we &apos;re pretending to help ,
so i told them my sister &apos;s homeless
and my balls are up inside me .
now , we just gotta hope spike &apos;s not the chatty type .
oh ! they just dropped .
hey , andy , question .
what does this face say to you ?
i don &apos;t know , like , &quot; i &apos;m cool . &quot;
so close ! guess again .
okay , like , &quot; i &apos;m better than you . &quot;
no , like , &quot; i &apos;m it , and you can suck it . &quot;
yes ! yes ! they can suck it !
is that what you &apos;re wearing tonight ?
yeah . no ?
a sweater ?
i always saw you in a suit tonight .
run home real quick and put on a suit .
hurry , people are starting to come .
uh , max is still making the face .
i know . i can &apos;t stop .
i &apos;ve waited my whole life to make this face .
max , look .
our business is open .
wait , wait , wait . not quite .
in five , four , three , two .
name , please ?
sophie kuchenski .
guest of honor .
how many in your party ?
see , i knew it was my party !
max , there &apos;s a line all the way down the hall
and i &apos;ve given out , like , a hundred business cards !
you know what that means ?
being poor can suck it !
girl , the fire marshal just dropped by ,
and told me we can &apos;t let anymore people in
till some of these folks go out .
nevel , none of my guests are even here yet .
it is very important to let in any guy who looks hot ,
but you know would screw you over .
is there any other type ?
i &apos;ll go get some more cupcakes .
hey ! how &apos;s it going so far , babe ?
andy , what are you doing ?
i told you to come back in a suit .
yeah , i know , but i like what i &apos;m wearing .
so you &apos;re telling me you &apos;ll just go and do what you want ,
no matter how much i try to control you ?
yeah .
that is so freaking hot .
caroline !
caroline , i can &apos;t get in !
caroline !
less kissing , more noticing me !
see , i know her , and my name &apos;s on the list .
han lee .
honey , if i was a fat girl ,
and your name was sara lee ,
you still wouldn &apos;t be getting in .
we are at capacity !
hey , robbie . on the list .
go right on in , child .
uh , hello ?
do you need a dictionary to define the word &quot; capacity ? &quot;
i have clear orders :
only very hot men who look like trouble .
excuse me , you know where i can find max ?
yes , she &apos;s in the back .
cool .
robbie , it &apos;s me , caroline .
oh , sorry .
did we have sex ?
what ? no !
i &apos;m max &apos;s roommate .
oh , max had a roommate ?
i was pretty much wasted the whole time .
i remember , like , nothing ,
but i &apos;m in the program now , so it &apos;s one day at a time .
well , max is through there .
cool .
but we did have sex , right ?
no ! we did not have sex .
you offered , but i wasn &apos;t into you .
yeah , right .
hey , max .
robbie !
why are you making that face ?
you have a toothache or something ?
no , it &apos;s @-@ i &apos;m successful now
and this is my shop .
wow . cool .
so listen , i &apos;m an alcoholic now ,
and i did a lot of stuff that wasn &apos;t cool ,
and i came here because the program
says that i have to make almonds .
&quot; almonds &quot; ?
you mean &quot; amends &quot; ?
cool .
so , look , i cheated on you
behind your back , like , every day .
well , um , we don &apos;t have to go into all this now .
it &apos;s kind of a big night for me .
and i stole money from you too ,
like , every time we had sex .
but we had a lot of sex .
i know .
well , i stole a lot of money .
well , this just went from &quot; suck it &quot; to &quot; it sucks , &quot;
so lift up your shirt .
i gotta get something out of tonight .
money well spent .
just found out i paid for more sex
than an arab businessman .
maybe this wasn &apos;t the healthiest thing i could &apos;ve done tonight .
so what do you wanna do ?
should i tell nevel to keep johnny out ?
too late . way too late .
max .
hi .
you look even better than i remember .
well , i should . i just got blown .
suck it , suck it , suck it , suck it .
max , this place is so awesome .
it &apos;s like you &apos;re telling everybody
who ever doubted you to suck it .
no , we &apos;re not petty like that .
hey , it &apos;s a little loud in here .
you wanna talk in the hall ?
uh , wait , let me take a look around my big , successful shop .
yeah , i can go .
keep your eye on max .
that guy in the brad pitt glasses broke her heart ,
and i don &apos;t trust him .
max , you look insanely good .
thanks .
now , maybe you could repeat that to your wife ,
and where is she ?
we never got married .
max ! max ! i can &apos;t get in !
wait , what do you mean you didn &apos;t get married ?
johnny ! hey , johnny , i &apos;m back here !
i didn &apos;t know if i was gonna tell you ,
but then i got your invite--
max ! johnny ! i &apos;m back here !
should we just go say &quot; hi &quot; ?
uh , no , not right now .
max ! max ! i can &apos;t get in !
max ! johnny !
max , i &apos;ve been thinking about you a lot .
stop . before you say anything else ,
i just have to say
i need candy .
all right , what were you saying ?
i called off the wedding because she wasn &apos;t the one ,
and you wanna know how i know that ?
max ! johnny !
i can &apos;t get into the party !
come here .
help me out !
seriously !
that doorman is a biatch !
okay , so , uh--
wait , what are we doing ?
making out in a room full of candy .
right .
no , no , this can &apos;t happen .
i was gonna give you my &quot; suck it &quot; face .
okay , give it to me . i deserve it .
your &quot; suck it &quot; face is hot .
it &apos;s the hair .
greatest night of my life !
disclaimer : this is not my t @-@ shirt ,
though i am all about the girl power .
disclaimer : it &apos;s not my t @-@ shirt either .
some nerd left it in the dryer at the laundromat .
it &apos;s mine .
girl power !
no way . no way !
do i smell chocolate chips ?
and is uncle andy making pancakes ?
you do , and i am .
dude , i don &apos;t know you ,
but chocolate chip pancakes are the balls .
how did you two sleep ?
did we sleep ?
great ! so what &apos;s gonna happen now ?
i meant today , at the shop ,
our big first day in business !
you thought i was talking about you two ?
plbbt ! i don &apos;t care about you two .
plbbt ! nobody cares about you two .
well , first , we have to clean the party mess up .
andy and i did it last night
when you didn &apos;t come back .
um , can someone here mellow out
and put some pancakes in her pancake hole ?
no , caroline , i get it .
it &apos;s been a rocky ride for max and me .
see , when we met , i had a girlfriend .
which he never told her about , and--
and keep eating .
and because of that ,
max and i never really got together ,
and then that girl and i broke up ,
and by the time i saw max again , i was--
engaged to be married ?
yeah , yeah , i was gonna get married .
wait , to that same girlfriend ?
different one . different one .
yeah , but that didn &apos;t work out either ,
and i &apos;ve had a couple girlfriends since--
oh ! only a couple !
yeah , none of them seemed to work out .
none of them are max .
hey , save me a pancake .
it looks like caroline has plans to eat them all .
well , max , as far as the &quot; suck it &quot; plan goes ,
it looks like somebody sucked something .
pancakes , pancake hole .
he &apos;s a good guy .
yeah , he seems cool .
kinda falls in love a lot , but hey ...
and i did not tell him to say that .
he never does what i say . it &apos;s hot .
&quot; but hey &quot; what ?
oh , we &apos;re continuing ?
um , i don &apos;t know .
maybe i &apos;m partial , but max ,
you &apos;re an &quot; a. &quot;
he kind of seems like a &quot; b. &quot;
minus .
first of all , look at me .
i am clearly a &quot; d , &quot;
and i don &apos;t think he falls in love a lot .
man , i love , love , love pancakes .
if i could , i would marry a pancake .
what time is it ?
10 : 20 .
well , it &apos;s the first day open .
all those people are probably tired from the party .
yeah .
oh , and look ! we forgot to light it up .
people don &apos;t know we &apos;re open .
in five , four , three , two .
go to work .
first day !
yep .
no one &apos;s here .
remember : all we have to sell is 70 cupcakes a day
to keep on track .
70 cupcakes ? that &apos;s not so hard .
maybe we should do the light again .
in five , four , three , two .
what time is it now ?
tomorrow , we only need to sell 140 cupcakes .
140 cupcakes ! that &apos;s not so hard .
how many did we sell today ?
four .
and all were to johnny .
i think i &apos;ve made a terrible mistake .
it &apos;s only been three days .
business will pick up .
no , with johnny .
it &apos;s different now that he &apos;s available .
maybe i &apos;m the kind of person
who only wants something they can &apos;t have ,
and then when they get it , they don &apos;t want it anymore .
okay , but do you feel that way about the cupcake shop too ?
no , i love our cupcake shop .
wow , that &apos;s the first time i &apos;ve ever said
i loved anything out loud ,
except for robitussin .
it &apos;s johnny .
well , i know what i have to do .
max , you can &apos;t change your mind about him now .
he &apos;s our only customer !
by the way , i &apos;ve always loved him .
hey , guys .
um , could we talk in the kitchen ?
wait , before you go , i just wanna say
that no matter what goes down in life ,
we are always open to your business .
we &apos;re either gonna have crazy kitchen sex
or i &apos;m getting expelled .
we &apos;re not having kitchen sex .
it &apos;s way too dirty in here
from other people having kitchen sex .
so i &apos;m getting expelled ?
it &apos;s weird , right ? between us ?
yeah , i don &apos;t know what it is .
maybe it &apos;s an absence of a lot of candy ...
but it &apos;s not the same .
max ! johnny ! i thought i heard you .
max !
i can &apos;t get out !
maybe we &apos;re only at our best
when you have another girlfriend .
maybe give me a call when you get that going
in , like , ten minutes .
or i could just call you on my actual wedding day .
oh , cool !
yeah , just call me 30 minutes
before the service , and i &apos;ll be there .
or better yet , call me at , like , your 50th wedding anniversary .
yeah , now that &apos;s hot .
max !
johnny ! i &apos;m cold !
kiss good @-@ bye ?
seriously , guys , i can &apos;t feel my toes !
see , it &apos;s hot again &apos; cause we broke up !
i &apos;ll see you at my 50th ,
if not before .
first the party , now this .
when i have a party , you won &apos;t be on the list .
you &apos;re right . i deserve that .
no , i was doing a power move .
please , i &apos;m begging you to come .
we &apos;ll see .
i might be a little too busy
with my big , successful cupcake shop ,
so suck it .
