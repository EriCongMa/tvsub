alaric &apos;s babies are the future of the coven .
they would have protected them in any way they could .
they &apos;re inside of you .
i totally get that if you want to run for the hills .
i &apos;m not going anywhere because i love you .
marry me .
yes !
i got valerie pregnant in 1863 .
julian beat her until the baby was no longer alive .
i want him dead , damon , now .
he took her child from her ,
and you would side with him ?
no . what are you doing ?
this doesn &apos;t represent our love .
nora !
our mother went out of her way
to forget us forever .
as far as i &apos;m concerned ,
she deserves what she gets .
you &apos;re either a salvatore , or you &apos;re one of us .
you are wrong , julian .
lily !
damon .
say something .
you made your bed .
have a nice nap .
stefan , you can &apos;t go .
she has damon and caroline .
because she wants you .
well , then she &apos;s gonna get me .
oh , and i , uh , burned my porsche ,
so i kind of need to borrow your car .
i &apos;m coming with you .
no , you &apos;re not .
stefan .
she already has two people that i care about .
i &apos;m not gonna let her have a third , ok ?
if anything happens to you ,
i will rain hell down on anyone responsible .
don &apos;t be so dramatic .
i &apos;ll be back before you know it .
well , this it ?
this the whole funeral party ?
where &apos;s your girlfriend ?
not your concern .
trouble in paradise ?
what about julian ? where is he ?
i haven &apos;t heard from either of them in days .
i sided with lily , or did you forget ?
it &apos;s just us .
beau couldn &apos;t bring himself to say good @-@ bye .
i &apos;m sure he just couldn &apos;t find
the right words to say .
all right . let &apos;s get her done .
wait . we should say something .
no , we shouldn &apos;t .
yes , we should .
when i was a girl ,
i loved my mother deeply .
she loved me , too , until she found out
about my little siphoning problem .
if she only knew that was just one of the things
that made me different .
when she turned her back on me ,
i thought i &apos;d never find that kind of love again .
you proved me wrong .
thank you , lily .
next .
you knew me at my brightest and my darkest .
no matter what my mood ,
you always saw the light in me .
i &apos;ll miss you , lily .
cream violets .
you remembered .
of course i did .
thank you .
we &apos;ll leave you two .
well ?
how many times do you get a second chance
to deliver your mother &apos;s eulogy ?
good point , brother .
how &apos;s this ?
lily , you were a terrible mother when you were alive ,
and you were a terrible mother when you were dead .
you &apos;re right . it does feel good .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i promise i &apos;ll make this right .
last year , we filled 10 crates .
this year , i am aiming for 20 .
you know , compelling people to donate
doesn &apos;t actually count as donating .
wait till you see me .
i popped this week .
i have a pot belly .
yeah ? put on a santa hat ,
you &apos;d fit right in here .
sure you don &apos;t need me over there ?
to do what ? come to boring birthing classes ?
you &apos;re chasing after an immortal jerk
who basically killed your mother .
that &apos;s much more important .
i can handle this .
of course you can .
caroline ?
you still there ?
yes . here .
how are you ?
i &apos;m good .
i &apos;d be a lot better if my traveling companion
would actually stick to task instead
of stopping by every single bar we pass by .
it &apos;s a pub crawl , stef .
that &apos;s the whole point .
don &apos;t be such a grinch ,
or you &apos;ll get coal in your stocking .
and that &apos;s my cue . i &apos;ll call you later .
&quot; hey , stefan . did i mention bonnie saw me
mix a blood bag with a jar of mayonnaise
at 2 : 00 in the morning ? &quot;
ok . one , that was marshmallow fluff ,
and , two , i &apos;m feeding for 3 now ,
so i get cravings .
fair . why not just tell him ?
because he doesn &apos;t need to worry
about the specifics of my magical pregnancy
with alaric &apos;s babies .
words that should probably not be spoken at that volume .
you ready to go to this class ?
now i am !
you know it &apos;s a birthing class , right , caroline ,
and not sat prep ?
you sure you can handle this on your own ?
if you can handle all of this while pregnant ,
i can handle a fraction of it while not .
go to your class .
that was the least graphic one i could find .
study up .
so what &apos;s it gonna be--
uncle stefan , unkie stefy ?
i got it !
creepy dude who hangs out with mom
who &apos;s not dad .
see , the thing is , she &apos;s not their mom .
oh , come on . it &apos;s caroline .
you think she &apos;s gonna turn those kids over
to a functioning alcoholic
with no supervision ?
whatever she wants to do .
so diplomatic .
you &apos;re gonna make an amazing not @-@ father .
it &apos;s kind of your thing , isn &apos;t it , hmm ?
what &apos;s that , damon ?
just barely not being a father .
you know , in these last few weeks ,
your jokes , they &apos;ve gotten quite sad .
you know what ? you need me , little brother .
sucks for you , but julian &apos;s almost 500 years old ,
and you ain &apos;t taking him alone ,
no matter how many vervain darts
and stakes you have on you , hmm .
what i need , damon , is your actions , not your words .
sounds like you should have brought beau then .
i &apos;m here to help . trust me .
i got more vervain syringes and grenades strapped to my body .
one wrong step , and i &apos;m vampire shrapnel .
relax . eggnog ?
julian &apos;s not here
if that &apos;s what you &apos;re worried about .
is he coming back ?
none of your concern .
i left a few things .
i &apos;ll just grab them and be on my way .
have you seen her ?
we &apos;ve spoken .
this is your fault , you know ,
this fracturing .
yeah . if only i hadn &apos;t fallen in love
and placed my pregnant womb in front of julian &apos;s boot .
sticking to your story , are you ?
it &apos;s not a story .
even if by some stretch of the imagination it &apos;s not ,
the timing is awfully suspect , isn &apos;t it ?
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
well , you had over 100 years to tell this story ,
and you only did once you were back in stefan &apos;s life ,
till it served you , gained you sympathy .
and i always thought you were the nice one ,
that you had a heart deep down .
guess i was wrong .
nora will blossom without you .
you appear tired .
nora . how unexpected .
what are you doing here ?
uh , i have a toy for a tot .
you shouldn &apos;t have .
i didn &apos;t actually .
it was a passive aggressive gift for when
mary louse came crawling back to me ,
but that hasn &apos;t happened , so ...
still very generous of you .
i know .
ok . you delivered it . yay . that &apos;s the end .
but how will the tot know the toy &apos;s from me ?
i &apos;ll tell them .
and you &apos;re still not leaving .
i want to be more involved .
see , i recently enrolled in classes , and--
you &apos;re going to school here ? why ?
because i was curious about college
and , well , mary louise hated the idea , so--
spite . that &apos;s a good reason for higher education .
look . you clearly need help .
not from an evil heretic who kidnapped my friend .
are you going to let that old news
get in the way of a little charity ?
and i &apos;m evil .
collection booth .
the far one ,
like , way over there .
yeah . you see it ? see ?
just so we &apos;re clear ,
me helping you kill julian
is your christmas present ,
so don &apos;t be expecting any socks
or a tv or anything .
yeah . well , we got to find him to kill him .
we will . bonnie did the locator spell ,
and she said sunbury .
we &apos;re in sunbury , so--
i &apos;m dry .
pit stop .
merry christmas , brother .
think we found him .
gonna be a lot of disappointed faces christmas morning .
yeah , well , maybe if we hadn &apos;t
stopped at every single bar for eggnog ,
we could have done something about it .
yeah , and maybe been two more bodies in this pile .
what are you trying to say ?
i &apos;m not trying to say anything .
what i am saying is maybe we should just
take a little bit of a beat , you know ?
i mean , look around .
julian is clearly off the proverbial rails here .
what ? since when you do you think logically ?
i &apos;m level @-@ headed damon .
i only come out when stefan goes a little cuckoo ,
and since you &apos;re letting your mommy
and could @-@ have @-@ been @-@ daddy issues drive you right now--
so you don &apos;t think that julian deserves to die ?
i do 100 % but not if it means us dying ,
so i think we should just stop and think about some backup .
you are my backup .
you &apos;re just terrible at it ,
and if julian &apos;s off the rails , then good .
it means he &apos;s careless .
i mean , look at these wounds .
they &apos;re fresh , which means he &apos;s obviously still in town ,
so either you help me find him , or--
don &apos;t be so dramatic , stefan .
i got this .
hello , damon .
bon bon , sorry to do this to you , but--
what a lovely way to be greeted .
&quot; hi , bonnie . i need something . &quot;
well , isn &apos;t it so great to feel loved and needed ?
so julian .
yeah . i &apos;ve already done a locator spell .
yes , yes , you did , which led us
to this santa @-@ infested hell hole ,
but is there , like , a way to do , like ,
a zoom @-@ in spell or something maybe
a little more accurate like an address or--
it doesn &apos;t work that way , damon .
right . well , here &apos;s the deal , bonnie .
stefan &apos;s here , and he &apos;s being kind of a crazy person .
he &apos;s breathing down my neck ,
and i was just kind of hoping you might have
some information for me , you know what i mean ?
actually , there might be something i can do .
brilliant .
i &apos;ll text you in a bit .
look at me , pulling my weight .
and what if no matter how much you plan
your water breaks at home ?
coat--note the color , odor , amount , and time ,
keep your birth plan on hand ,
and call your care provider .
someone really dug into that suggested reading list .
well , yeah . i hope everyone did .
it &apos;s a baby .
i mean , each and every one of us are bringing
a life into the world .
that is a huge responsibility .
encouraging words , caroline , as always .
thank you .
ok . let &apos;s pick this back up next time .
don &apos;t give me that look .
what look ?
that is a &quot; your hormones are making you crazy
because you are pregnant &quot; look ,
which i will have you know is really just
a man &apos;s attempt to minimize the gift
that our bodies bring into this world .
&quot; a feminist guide to pregnancy , &quot;
chapter 4 , page 43 .
actually , i believe that particular quote
is found in chapter 3 .
what ? you think i &apos;m not gonna read every book that you &apos;re reading ?
isn &apos;t he a professor at whitmore ?
yeah , and she &apos;s a student .
what is it ? is everything ok ?
yeah . it &apos;s just my vamp hearing is working
a little too well lately .
what do you want to bet
she &apos;s doing really well in his class ?
no . it &apos;s ok .
they &apos;re just having a difficult time
with the subtle realities of the 21st century ,
where families come in all shapes and sizes .
i think i should explain it to them ...
caroline--
that i have a boyfriend ,
and while he may not be the father--
caroline , caroline , caroline , caroline ,
your eyes , your eyes .
it &apos;s just the ... hormones .
here you go .
that &apos;s your gift , stickers ?
did you stop by the gas station
on the way over or just fish them from the rubbish ?
professor dowling or markus ?
excuse me ?
you &apos;re taking freshman english , right ?
who &apos;s your professor ?
please tell me it &apos;s dowling and not markus .
i can deal with difficult people .
oh , i know you can , which is why i &apos;m saying take dowling .
i don &apos;t want professor markus to end up dead .
i &apos;m joking .
sort of .
let me guess .
hot cocoa and vervain .
close . bourbon .
i &apos;m sorry i was harsh earlier .
i heard you listened to valerie and
that you sided with lily against julian .
i mean , you must be attempting to turn over a new leaf ,
and you clearly don &apos;t have anyone else .
lovely . a pity friend ,
just what i always wanted .
college can be lonely and terrible ,
or it can be fun .
a pity friend is still a friend .
what do you need from me ?
excuse me ?
i wasn &apos;t born yesterday .
it &apos;s all right .
i want to do some charity .
i might as well start .
have you heard of a town called sunbury ?
so when do you think this denial phase
of yours is gonna come to an end ?
what ? what are you waiting for , stefan ?
a breakdown , a teary , emotional , &quot; i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s all my fault &quot; ?
well , you &apos;re gonna be a long time , bro .
yeah . i just refuse to believe that you care
so little about your own flesh and blood .
why is that ?
death doesn &apos;t erase all the crappy things
she did , stefan .
if anything , it lets me care about her even less .
hello , boys .
if you &apos;ll just pardon me a moment .
what are you doing ?
i seem to have misplaced my cellular telephone .
these things have a way of , you know ,
jumping out of your hand and just ...
scurrying off .
stop looking .
here it is .
well , i feel stupid . don &apos;t you feel stupid ?
because , see , stefan and i thought you had
some really great maniacal plan ,
but turns out you &apos;re just a drunk sorority girl
who ruins everyone &apos;s night by losing her cell phone .
well , it has been a rough few weeks
for all of us , i suppose ,
after what we went through .
we ?
what do you mean by &quot; we &quot; ?
well , you lost your mother ,
and i lost the love of my life .
she meant nothing to you .
she meant everything to me !
sorry .
yes .
do you remember this sword ?
when you , you know , drove it through my chest ?
you didn &apos;t quite have all the pieces together ,
though , did you , literally ?
see , when a vampire is stabbed through the heart with , uh ,
the completed sword ,
it acts as a magical conduit ,
transferring their spirit into this ...
particularly nasty stone ,
and the purpose of the stone is to punish
vampires like you boys .
every sin you &apos;ve committed
goes into creating your own little personal hell .
i spent over 100 years trapped inside .
100 .
then lily saved me .
and for the briefest of moments--
i had her back in my life .
so ... she was the only thing that kept
the madness of the stone at bay , you know ,
the only thing that kept me ...
sane .
wait . that was you sane ?
well , it was , but , uh , now ...
these have been dark days for me .
so then they followed him to ridley park ,
old saybrook , and finally sunbury .
they need to leave immediately .
julian is not one who enjoys solitude .
those towns are places he used to live .
then i remembered
what my old life looked like .
and i--i realized--
i mean , it was a good life .
i was surrounded by the people
that i cared about ...
my friends .
two , two .
raphael here i met in florence
in the 1600s .
he was a painter , terrible painter , though ,
but a painter .
dirty robin i found in a convent
in massachusetts in , uh , 1802 , was it ?
she loved those nuns .
seth over there , i rescued you
from a claim jumper in california
during the gold rush ,
and , xi nguyen , i met you last week actually
in portland .
now i know you two have been following me
for quite some time , right ?
i hope it wasn &apos;t for nefarious reasons .
well , that depends .
is killing you nefarious ?
all right , guys . listen .
i &apos;m sure we all miss lily .
well , most of you .
you guys in particular ,
but i &apos;m sure wherever she is she &apos;s looking up and thinking ,
&quot; i wish those boys wouldn &apos;t fight . &quot;
i &apos;m not going anywhere .
good .
good .
fine . plan &quot; b. &quot;
booze @-@ soaked flammable costumes .
can i have one of the boy toys ?
of course you can .
you can be anything you want .
don &apos;t let society tell you differently .
what ? surprised i &apos;m not massacring
the leukemia patients ?
it &apos;s still early .
christmas was always my favorite holiday .
when i was growing up , it was much different than all this .
i would have been happy with a hoop and a stick .
but still , being surrounded by your loved ones--
this looks just like her .
what ?
you and mary louise broke up .
she made her choice . it was a bad one .
but--
no buts , ok ?
you need to move on and become your own person .
you can only do that if you &apos;re living
in the present , not the past ,
which means you need to stop thinking about her
and talking about her , ok ?
she &apos;s dead to you .
am i ?
can we talk ?
i was two seconds away from tearing their heads off .
they were jerks . they deserved it .
oh , i &apos;ve needed this all day .
yeah , you and me both .
do you think this is ok for the babies ?
caroline .
i &apos;m serious .
what if blood is like alcohol ?
what &apos;s if it &apos;s bad for them ?
look . if it &apos;s good for you ,
how can it be bad for them ?
i don &apos;t know , but you don &apos;t know either .
because there &apos;s no studies on this ,
there &apos;s no books , there--
look , caroline . you &apos;re doing a great job .
would you stop saying that ?
but you are .
i mean , do you realize how happy you &apos;ve made me ?
i mean , this is a miracle .
you &apos;ve turned my life around .
i said stop !
i ... have to go .
caroline !
well ?
well , what ?
are you going to apologize ?
am i going to apologize ?
for what ?
for telling me that you would marry me
and then throwing the ring i gave you back in my face .
oh , you mean the ring that julian gave you ?
is that what &apos;s bothering you ?
he &apos;s the reason lily is dead .
no , he &apos;s not .
julian is just as upset as any of us .
valerie &apos;s story is responsible .
you still believe him .
he &apos;s a liar . why can &apos;t you see that ?
if i say he &apos;s a liar ,
can we go back home ?
i &apos;m tired of fighting .
so am i.
i &apos;m done , mary lou .
ok . it--it &apos;s over .
you &apos;ve been wanting this for a long time ,
haven &apos;t you ?
almost like you &apos;ve been planning it all along .
you &apos;re paranoid .
am i ? it took you no time
to enroll in classes ,
move into a dorm , make friends with our enemies .
have you been following me ?
i &apos;ve been following someone ,
but she certainly hasn &apos;t been acting like my girlfriend .
i wanted to do something different with you actually .
yeah , but you &apos;re too scared to go out into the world ,
too scared to change .
you think i &apos;m scared to play santa
for some pathetic humans ?
and when was the last time you even did any charity ?
i don &apos;t know .
probably when i started dating you .
ok . so we reload , we figure out a way
to separate him from his friends .
we do no such thing .
we get in the car , and we go home .
what ? what are you talking about ?
he &apos;s building a small army back there .
he &apos;s obviously up to something .
he &apos;s getting wasted with his friends .
you &apos;re delusional . trust me .
that--that is a hornets &apos; nest ,
and take it from an expert ,
you do not want to kick it .
you of all people should not be the one to give up .
you &apos;re the reason that he &apos;s alive and she isn &apos;t .
what kind of backwards @-@ ass logic is that ?
because we would have killed julian the minute
he showed up into our lives , but no .
you wanted to punish lily with a long con , didn &apos;t you ?
she punished herself with a short stake .
you know , for weeks , i &apos;ve been watching you ,
i &apos;ve been trying to catch even
the slightest bit of regret on your face .
regret for what , stefan ?
she was dying , damon .
how difficult would it have been to say something nice ?
well , i didn &apos;t want to lie to the woman .
all she wanted was forgiveness ,
and you practically spat in her face .
she didn &apos;t deserve my forgiveness .
what , because she made some mistakes ,
or is it because she didn &apos;t choose poor you
over valerie ?
giving her a hall pass like always ,
her little angel .
you acted like a spoiled , little brat , a coward .
you had a chance to make things right , and you still do .
road trip &apos;s over , brother .
you want to go back and risk it , go for it .
i &apos;m going home .
please tell me this is the julian is dead call .
i wish . i &apos;m headed home . damon bailed on me .
and here i was looking forward to leaving all this behind me .
he thinks i &apos;m overreacting .
any reaction is appropriate
when it comes to what he &apos;s done to us .
i am sick of everyone giving this monster a pass .
i should have gone with you .
we could have ended this .
we still can .
have you seen mary louise ?
i &apos;ve been here all day .
you &apos;d think that would earn me better service !
i think you &apos;ve had enough .
you have no idea how poor your timing is .
you sure about that ?
you look like you could use a friend .
things with nora didn &apos;t quite work out , did they ?
i would hold your tongue
if you value its existence .
and i would not make threats
when there &apos;s a cloaked heretic behind you .
payback &apos;s a bitch .
stay with her and make sure she &apos;s unconscious
until julian &apos;s dead .
guess it didn &apos;t go well .
she called me a charity case .
why don &apos;t i get you a tissue ?
oh , it &apos;s all right .
i used one of your hideous tops .
which is now your hideous top .
can i ask you what might seem like a mean question ?
fire away . it &apos;s not like i &apos;m in a fragile state
or anything .
what do you see in her ,
aside from the fact that she looks like
a blond angelina jolie ?
she &apos;s loving , protective , kind .
but just to you .
that &apos;s fair .
she does always think of me first .
maybe i &apos;m spoiled or old @-@ fashioned ,
but it &apos;s nice having that one person
who doesn &apos;t need anything from you ,
who just loves you
and thinks you &apos;re the most amazing , beautiful girl
in the whole world , you know ?
maybe--maybe you don &apos;t .
i don &apos;t need someone to tell me i &apos;m pretty .
nobody needs it .
that doesn &apos;t mean it doesn &apos;t feel good to hear it .
thank you for today .
you &apos;re a very kind person and ...
beautiful .
even if you do wear hideous tops .
i guess i was wrong .
what ?
you and your friends are not kind at all .
i &apos;m sure there are places
that would have loved those as a donation .
back so soon ?
that tends to happen when i &apos;m threatened .
where is she ?
i &apos;m not exactly sure who she is .
don &apos;t play dumb .
i got your brother &apos;s text message .
i was told to come alone .
i am here alone .
now where is mary louise ?
stefan kidnapped mary louise ?
ballsy .
i just spent two hours crammed
in a small metal tube , flying across the country
to be here .
it was hell .
but that is just a fraction of the hell
that this sword will put you in
if i don &apos;t get her back .
look , jules .
you and i , we got no beef , ok ?
you didn &apos;t kill my baby , and i don &apos;t blame you
for lily &apos;s death .
it was her own stupid fault .
kindly do not speak that way about your mother .
let &apos;s just stick with lily .
mother &apos;s incidental .
right . i forgot .
you don &apos;t care about your mother .
look at you not caring as you burn her clothes ,
attempting to erase every trace
of her existence .
i needed space in my closet .
see , i always knew that her love for you
would get her killed .
it was toxic .
no . it was nonexistent .
it &apos;s easier for you to think
that way , isn &apos;t it ?
because then you don &apos;t have to take
any responsibility for her death .
she killed herself .
because she couldn &apos;t turn her back on you .
funny , because i would have had no problem turning mine on her .
i don &apos;t know what your hell will be ,
but i hope she &apos;s there .
hi , mom .
i just realized that this is going to be
my first christmas without you .
that sucks .
i still got you something ,
two somethings actually .
i will spare you the details of how
vecause honestly i am sick of talking about it ,
but it &apos;s happening .
i &apos;m pregnant .
i used to picture us having this conversation .
it looked different obviously .
i was a human carrying my own children ,
and you ... were ...
you were alive .
i know they &apos;re not mine ...
but they &apos;re still my responsibility ,
you know , and i want to ...
i have to do this right .
and i have no idea what i &apos;m doing .
and all i want to do is just sit
on our kitchen counter while you burn our dinner
and ask you a million questions .
god , i miss you .
thought you ran away .
in my own house ?
i &apos;m twice your age .
i could take both of you .
well , you could certainly try .
i would have killed you on sight
if it weren &apos;t for your mother .
i respected her .
clearly the feeling wasn &apos;t mutual .
stefan !
no !
now i &apos;ll run .
damon ?
who &apos;s there ?
oh , my god .
damon wanted me to let it go .
i should have let it go .
i couldn &apos;t .
she was your mom , stefan ,
and if you think it &apos;s easy to let something like that go ,
take it from a girl who just got back
from her mom &apos;s grave , it &apos;s--it &apos;s not .
let &apos;s figure out a way to save your brother .
oh , she &apos;s not answering .
we need to call valerie . stefan ?
he &apos;s not gonna make it in there .
yes , he will .
that stone is punishment for every bad thing
you &apos;ve ever done .
this is damon .
i don &apos;t even want to know what he &apos;s going through .
he can survive this .
even if he can , he &apos;ll be different ...
just like you .
stefan !
