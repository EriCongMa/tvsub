we are live with a big story just breaking .
not long ago , an undercover operation turned into a bloodbath ,
when boston homicide detectives opened fire in the warehouse behind me .
now , details are still emerging , but we can confirm now --
one dead , two wounded in the shooting .
i shot my best friend &apos;s father .
you had no choice .
yeah , tell that to maura .
jane , you shot a man who is head of the irish mob ,
20 years on the run , suspected of 15 murders .
well , he was nice to her , though .
biology doesn &apos;t make him her father
or mean you stop doing your job .
my god , i didn &apos;t think this was the way
we &apos;d take down paddy doyle .
you shouldn &apos;t have come here by yourself .
why not ?
kevin , don &apos;t ! don &apos;t !
no !
maura !
maura .
don &apos;t touch him !
maura -- - no , i mean it !
don &apos;t you dare touch him .
oh , god . she hates me .
she &apos;s just in shock , jane .
take your jacket !
maura , come on .
i had to .
paddy showed up , and he shot our suspect .
no , he shot the guy who tried to run me over
with his car yesterday -- put my mother in the hospital .
look , we had a handle on it
until paddy crashed our operation .
oh , you mean your boyfriend had a handle on it ?
thanks for letting me know that agent dean was planning to join us .
i didn &apos;t know he was gonna follow us in there !
what &apos;d you expect him to do ?
he &apos;s a federal agent ! paddy shot him !
in the leg !
if paddy wanted dean dead , he &apos;d be dead !
what are you saying ?
you don &apos;t think your father was there to take us all out ?
shoot me , too ?
he was only there to protect me .
if that &apos;s what you think , you are naive ...
or ignorant ... or i don &apos;t know what .
well , at least i don &apos;t play judge and jury
and kill people .
you guys will make up .
yeah . yeah , that &apos;s what they said about the beatles .
we should have never let her do this .
never .
this is my first undercover assignment .
wait .
i &apos;m doin &apos; a u.c.
i feel like donnie brasco .
well , you don &apos;t look like him .
can you keep it down , please ?
all right , we &apos;re gonna tuck this wire right here .
the microphone doesn &apos;t make me
look like i have three breasts , does it ?
well , some guys are into that .
is this what you &apos;d wear to an undercover operation ?
i feel a little dressy .
i &apos;d wear a flak jacket .
oh , you know , i know this sounds vain ,
but i couldn &apos;t be a cop .
you , vain ?
well , even you look a little chunky in a flak jacket .
wow , really ? okay .
well , thank you very much ,
and you know what ?
i think your little medical examiner get @-@ ups
make you look like a trash collector .
you do ? so do i !
i always feel a little dumpy .
put your jacket on .
okay .
you want to know what &apos;s truly odd about you ?
ah , i &apos;m not sure .
you are the dumbest genius i know .
&quot; i &apos;m not sure &quot; means &quot; pause . &quot;
it means do not blurt your subconscious thoughts .
oh , right . sorry .
is this displaced aggression because i get to go undercover ,
and you have to be my backup ?
yes .
we should get in there .
okay . let &apos;s go .
listen to me . all right ? this is serious .
yep .
somebody is trying to kill you
to stop you from investigating a murder .
you don &apos;t have to tell me that .
i was there when he nearly drove over my mother .
you know we &apos;re only letting you do this
because we &apos;re hoping that whoever this guy is ,
he is desperate enough to follow you
into that warehouse and try again , all right ?
but we &apos;re gonna be there this time .
i &apos;m ready .
wait -- what do you guys say to each other
right before you pull the string ?
it &apos;s called a sting , maura .
sting .
we say , &quot; don &apos;t get made . &quot;
i like that . &quot; don &apos;t get made . &quot;
don &apos;t look so worried . what could go wrong ?
rizzoli .
i need to know what the hell just happened .
i got a dead suspect and an fbi agent with a bullet in his leg .
agent dean &apos;s gonna be fine . it was a through and through .
and i got one of the fbi &apos;s most wanted fugitives
dropping into the middle of my peoples &apos; undercover operation ?
is paddy gonna die ?
it doesn &apos;t look good .
you should have told me you knew paddy doyle was in town .
yeah , i know . i know .
give me your gun .
what ?
it &apos;s evidence now .
now get your ass back to headquarters .
captain connors is gonna need to interview you .
since when does the head of internal affairs do interviews ?
since now .
hey , ralph .
hey , officer wisniewski .
feeling lucky today .
a 20 @-@ year search for mobster
paddy doyle ended today .
one for the good guys , huh ?
yeah , but someone worse could take over .
at least paddy doyle was from southie ,
played by some rules .
... is in fact the father of dr. maura isles .
can you believe that &apos;s his daughter ?
you think that &apos;s good ? get this .
cop who shot him and the m.e. are best friends .
you can &apos;t make this stuff up .
how long have you known
that your friend is paddy doyle &apos;s daughter ?
well , what does that have to do with the shootings ?
answer the question .
two years .
were you aware that paddy doyle would be there ?
no .
why was agent dean there ?
i don &apos;t know .
what &apos;s your relationship with agent dean ?
we &apos;re colleagues .
do you have sexual relations with all your colleagues ?
excuse me ?
crap . did you know this , vince ?
... has nothing to do with the fact that doyle shot agent dean
and then he pointed his gun at me .
no . but it does tell us a lot about your judgment , detective .
we &apos;re in trouble .
dr. isles , two of the city &apos;s
best spine surgeons are evacuating the hematoma .
we should know more after that .
so no movement in his legs ?
does he have anyone ... any family ?
we &apos;ll need to know whether to resuscitate .
me .
i recently learned that he &apos;s my biological father .
this is sergeant detective cummings .
he &apos;ll be working with me on this .
detective , did you put a bolo out for paddy doyle ?
no , sir . i did not .
you doing favors for doyle
because dr. isles is your best friend ?
what ? no .
but you knew doyle sometimes
slipped into town to see his daughter ?
well , apparently , so did you .
oh , my god . a cop &apos;s been shot .
all right , let &apos;s go .
gentlemen , we got to take a break .
we got a homicide . jane , let &apos;s go .
hey , she &apos;s not going anywhere .
it &apos;s a cop .
that &apos;s a hell of a way to get out of an interview .
did you hear who it was ?
no . how you holding up ?
you saw -- we &apos;re not looking good .
we &apos;ll get through it .
no . no , we won &apos;t .
especially when he goes to interview the woman
who cannot tell a lie .
you got to call dr. isles ,
tell her how to play this .
i need you to back off , john .
i need them focused on this cop killing .
my people are clean .
yeah ? you want to bet your career on that , sean ?
she &apos;s not picking up . she knows it &apos;s me .
you don &apos;t know that .
look at you , agent dean . already up and around .
you betrayed me .
all right , jane , listen to me .
why would you tell internal affairs
that we had an intimate sexual relationship ?
how do you describe relationships
with men who spend the night in your bed ?
uh , i @-@ i &apos;ll pull the car around .
what were you doing there ? were you following me ?
i was following maura .
thinking it would lead to doyle .
that &apos;s why you came back , isn &apos;t it ?
you figure you show up with some greeting @-@ card cliches ,
then you follow my best friend around .
nobody &apos;s gonna ask any questions .
no , jane , it was not like that .
yeah . it was like that .
you thought you &apos;d be the hero .
you don &apos;t look too heroic , agent dean .
don &apos;t just walk away .
you know , we just lost a cop . i got a case to work .
why didn &apos;t you tell me you &apos;d found your biological father ?
would you have taken me if you ...
you &apos;d known i was paddy doyle &apos;s daughter ?
maura , darling , you &apos;my daughter .
your father and i raised you .
you &apos;re ours , not his .
can i come in ?
oh , angela .
how sweet of you to come .
thank you .
double homicide .
ralph ruffy and officer walter wis--
wally wisniewski ?
he transferred to evidence management
to get off the street .
what the hell happened ?
looks like a robbery .
well , what &apos;d they get ?
the register &apos;s not even open .
frost , you check the security video ?
just about to .
the body is that of a well @-@ nourished white male ,
approximately late 50s .
what is pike doing here ?
you mean other than annoying the crap out of people ?
we &apos;re stuck with him till dr. isles gets back .
dr. pike , how nice to have your expertise on this .
double homicide . almost
certainly a .38 @-@ caliber .
pretty big hole .
uh , maybe i &apos;ll just take a look .
cause of death is quite clear .
perhaps dr. isles needed your &quot; expert &quot; medical opinion
because she doubted her own .
i do not .
yes ... we were all frustrated with her wishy @-@ washy approach .
i love a man who knows what he thinks .
may i ?
you may , detective .
a faint mustache and beard are evident .
the lips are without injury .
he was shot in the back . that &apos;s not a classic robbery .
might want to have a look at this .
so , he panics before he gets the cash .
frankie , any other robberies reported in the area ?
nope .
like you said , doesn &apos;t feel like a classic robbery .
you think the gunman knew wally was a cop ?
the way i reacted just made jane &apos;s head off .
adrenaline impairs cognitive sequencing , but still ....
you were afraid for your life .
no , paddy wouldn &apos;t have shot me .
we can &apos;t help who we love .
i don &apos;t love paddy doyle .
he &apos;s done terrible things .
it &apos;s just when jane pulled that trigger ,
you know , i never really see how they end up
on my autopsy table .
and he kept trying to tell me something .
&quot; hope &quot; -- he kept saying &quot; hope . &quot;
i wonder if that was her name .
you mean your biological mother &apos;s name ?
dr. isles , i &apos;m sorry to have to ask you this ,
but you didn &apos;t fill out the dnr .
&quot; do not resuscitate . &quot;
i have no idea what he would have wanted .
i don &apos;t --
well , just think about it for a minute .
oh , maura . maura .
please don &apos;t .
my mother &apos;s very reserved . i &apos;m not very good at it , either .
jane always used to squirm off my lap .
you two have that in common .
you should go home . i &apos;ll be fine .
no , i @-@ i &apos;m gonna stay here .
no , i &apos;m used to being alone .
please . i &apos;ll be okay .
cavanaugh says connors just left headquarters .
get to the hospital before he does .
we have a double homicide to solve .
if we don &apos;t get out in front of this ,
we &apos;re not gonna be investigating any homicides .
you said it was a good shooting .
and now it &apos;s a witch hunt .
i.a.d. thinks we &apos;re dirty cops .
but we &apos;re not .
we bent a few rules , jane .
to outsiders , we look dirty .
go . now .
maura !
don &apos;t say anything . just listen .
jane , i &apos;m sorry , too .
we don &apos;t have much time .
the head of internal affairs is on his way up here
to get a statement from you about the shootings .
that &apos;s it ?
that &apos;s it ? that &apos;s all you have to say ?
not &quot; i &apos;m sorry that your father is dying &quot; ?
oh , he &apos;s your father now ?
what , am i sorry that a man who &apos;s wanted for 15 murders
didn &apos;t shoot me or frost ? no . i &apos;m not .
then why are you here ?
to warn you .
maura , if our friendship ever meant anything to you ,
will you please think before you answer the questions
you &apos;re about to be .
detective rizzoli !
... asked .
they &apos;re doing an investigation .
they &apos;re building a case . they think we &apos;re dirty .
your contempt for the rules borders on criminal .
you are talking to a witness !
she was just asking about my father .
you were ordered not to talk to each other
until our investigation is concluded .
i know this isn &apos;t a good time ,
but i do have some questions .
and you immediately informed detective rizzoli
that paddy doyle had resurfaced .
yes , but --
did detective rizzoli act on this information ?
she -- - excuse me .
he &apos;s coming out of sedation . you can see him now .
thank you .
look , i know this is uncomfortable for you ,
and i &apos;m sorry for that .
but this man is an organized @-@ crime figure .
well , he &apos;s not going anywhere right now .
do you want to help your friend ?
what do you mean ?
we know that paddy kept a book . did he ever mention it ?
a book ? no .
you understand this book is critical .
i saw &quot; the godfather . &quot;
i &apos;m guessing it &apos;s got names of everyone
who &apos;s ever paid off paddy or been paid .
we suspect it has the names of dirty cops .
jane isn &apos;t dirty !
the only way we &apos;re gonna clear the good cops
is to find the dirty ones .
book .
book will keep you safe .
is jane &apos;s friendship with me hurting her ?
because if it is , blame me , not her .
don &apos;t you touch her !
it &apos;s okay , buddy . it &apos;s okay .
don &apos;t . your sutures .
please , lie back down .
it &apos;s okay , buddy . calm down . calm down .
lie back down . i am fine , okay ?
i want i.a.d. people on the door 24 / 7
until he &apos;s in lock @-@ up , and i want that book .
maura .
is maura here ?
no . why are we whispering ?
do you remember when you thought you and becky zisti
were never gonna be friends again ?
i didn &apos;t shoot becky zisti &apos;s father , ma .
you want some tea ? it &apos;s from the sichuan province .
it gets its flavor from pandas .
how does it get its flavor from pandas ?
maura says that the pandas fertilize the tea plants .
that means they grow it in panda poop , ma .
y @-@ you want me to fix you something ?
what do you feel like eating ?
people .
come on . it &apos;s okay .
no , no . i don &apos;t want a hug .
well , at least you &apos;re not wally -- poor fella .
he should have just had my lasagna at the caf ?
so much safer .
did you really just say , &quot; at least you &apos;re not wally &quot; ?
oprah says if you think of three good things
that happened to you during the day ,
you &apos;ll perk right up .
well , i &apos;m not wally , you stopped hugging me ,
and i don &apos;t wear a size 11 shoe .
gee , i feel so perky !
people can &apos;t help the size of their feet .
this is cheery .
isn &apos;t it atmospheric ?
okay , you &apos;ve been living here way too long .
i like it !
one of constance &apos;s students drew it .
it &apos;s awful .
like my life !
is it okay if i just pat your knee ?
knock yourself out .
you know , your father and i
went to go see a marriage counselor once .
you did ?
wow . that was money well spent .
there was one thing dr. becker made us do ...
... that worked for a little bit .
is that when you had tommy ?
for heaven &apos;s sakes , jane . we already had tommy .
dr. becker made us tell him our story --
about how we met .
maura and i aren &apos;t a couple , ma .
i &apos;ll stop hugging if you tell me the story !
okay , okay , okay , okay . get off , get off .
i was in the drug unit .
i was so frightened when you were doing that work .
if you interrupt or hug ,
i &apos;m done .
so , when you &apos;re a girl doing buy @-@ busts ,
you got to be a hooker .
mother of mercy , you didn &apos;t have to do it .
mom , no ! come on !
it was my cover . i told you .
okay .
all right , so ...
i don &apos;t have any i.d. i don &apos;t have any money .
i &apos;m starving .
come on , stanley . you know i &apos;m good for it .
i don &apos;t know anything about you ... tiffany .
really ? $ 2 for a day @-@ old donut and bad coffee ?
please . come on , i &apos;ll get you after my shift .
you think you &apos;ll make that much ?
you know what ?
i hope big mo tows your chevy ,
i hope your crap coffee gives you an ulcer ,
and you die of psoriasis .
do you mind ?
you can get your non @-@ fat latte in a minute , all right ?
no , it &apos;s for you .
and given the vitamin d deficiency --
likely from your , uh -- from your night work --
you &apos;re better off with some plain yogurt
and some leafy greens .
i have my lice under control , thank you .
but stanley here has psoriasis .
psoriasis is not contagious . it &apos;s a genetic disease .
what about rudeness ? is that genetic , too ?
i was simply trying to be nice .
well , not every hooker has a heart of gold .
all right , sister ?
apparently not , sister .
you shouldn &apos;t be here .
not while they &apos;re investigating .
why ? what did you say to connors ?
i ...
well , you know i can &apos;t say anything .
ma , get your stuff .
jane clementine rizzoli !
what ? your middle name is clementine ?
thank you . thank you very much .
i thought it was pretty .
you &apos;re not staying here anymore .
what -- this isn &apos;t necessary .
what , because your family is so screwed up ,
now you need mine ?
what ? you &apos;re the one who always says
that blood is thicker than water .
so , choose .
hello ?
that &apos;s water . i &apos;m blood .
okay , you know what ? suit yourself .
sit here together and drink your excrement tea .
jane !
wait .
i &apos;m ... i &apos;m just gonna grab a couple things .
angela , wait .
take it .
i &apos;ve always hated it .
i &apos;ll be in the car .
you &apos;re like my daughter , too .
ma , what are you doing in my bed ?
that couch feels like a sack of marbles .
get out !
you made me leave my luxuriana mattress
for this kind of treatment ?
i &apos;m sorry , ma . i &apos;m sorry . ma .
ma . ma ? !
i &apos;m not talking to you .
i am not talking to you until you say three nice things .
how are you not talking to me
if you &apos;re talking to me ?
i ... found all the lids to my tupperware ,
and i @-@ i ...
don &apos;t have leprosy ,
and ...
and my really , really sweet mother left the comforts of her
free beacon hill guesthouse to come stay with me
in my crappy little apartment because she loves me .
yes , i do .
no , no hugging . no hugging . no , no hugging .
come on .
and this is where you tell me
that it &apos;s not a crappy little apartment .
ma .
ma !
hi . what are you doing here ?
i always have breakfast at ma &apos;s house when i do midnights .
this isn &apos;t ma &apos;s house .
no , thanks to you ,
she &apos;s crashing on a piece of plywood you call a couch .
oh , thanks to me ? well , i didn &apos;t see
you step up and help her out when dad left .
okay , could you two fight after we &apos;ve had breakfast ?
hey ! nice manners .
your mother would be so proud .
no , she wouldn &apos;t !
hey .
thought flowers were better than a greeting card .
well , that makes everything so much better .
jane clemen--
don &apos;t you say it !
i &apos;m late for work .
if you &apos;re on a stakeout to nail that dirty cop ,
jane rizzoli , i see you .
you have to listen to me .
no , i don &apos;t . you &apos;re trespassing .
we have paddy doyle on a wiretap .
just before he got shot .
you shouldn &apos;t be telling me this .
you could lose your job .
we know he &apos;s got people on the inside .
inside the police department ?
whoever he was working with -- or maybe for --
paddy is moving in to take over .
well , what does this have to do with i.a.d. crawling up my or
do you think i &apos;m working for paddy , too ?
i think you &apos;re being set up
so it looks that way .
well , thank you for telling me .
jane , um ... i was ordered back to washington .
i wish -- mm @-@ hmm .
yeah , i wish , too .
bye .
i thought you stopped with the jelly donuts .
don &apos;t bust my balls .
you keep eating crap like that ,
you won &apos;t be able to see your balls .
i don &apos;t need to see my balls .
20 grams of fat , dude .
what are you , a girl ?
guy gets a transfer to get off the street
and dies getting a sandwich .
anything ?
photo of the gunman is out there .
bad enough to lose one of our own
to some strung @-@ out needle freak
who can &apos;t figure out how to use a frigging cash register .
this i.a.d. business 
we &apos;ll come out clean .
all you need is the accusation .
that stink is hard to wash off .
i &apos;m worried about losing
five years of good convictions .
what d-- what does he mean ?
he means scum bags like little &quot; t &quot;
could use this as grounds for an appeal .
that is bullshit
yeah , it is . but it &apos;s happened before .
patrick sr. would be
rolling over in his grave
knowing that paddy showed up to protect his own kid .
what are you talking about ?
well , the story in southie is that
paddy fell in love with a harvard girl .
patrick sr . threatened to kill them both
if he didn &apos;t give her up .
you think it was maura &apos;s mother ?
might have been .
detective rizzoli is in autopsy .
better get down there quick before she kills pike .
she &apos;ll have to get in line .
pretty sure his dental work didn &apos;t kill him .
if we could just -- just get that bullet .
you cannot rush these things .
thought you said cause of death was quite clear .
i guess you &apos;re used to the antiquated
and sloppy methods of my predecessor .
could be . yes .
you know , i &apos;ve never said it before ,
but i &apos;m a very big fan of your work , dr. pike .
you are ?
you are ?
i @-@ i am . yes .
and it would help us enormously in this very important case
if you could remove the bullet
so we could run it through ballistics .
of course i can do that for you , detective rizzoli .
what a mess this place is .
um , aren &apos;t -- aren &apos;t you --
aren &apos;t you gonna use your fingers ?
forceps can leave tool impressions .
kind of messes with ballistics .
of course i wasn &apos;t gonna use the forceps .
think anybody would notice
if there was suddenly another corpse down here ?
excellent work , if i do say so myself .
thank you .
pretty big bullet .
for a .38 .
obviously a .45 .
obviously .
would you , uh , run that to ballistics for me , please ?
you &apos;re back .
did you ever return my book ,
&quot; soothing paint choices for the home &quot; ?
yeah , a long time ago .
so , you &apos;re back .
that &apos;s odd , &apos; cause i can &apos;t seem to find it .
did you ever return my &quot; guns of the world digest &quot; ?
i always return things i borrow .
are you sure ?
of course i &apos;m sure . maybe you lost it .
you do lose things .
has dr. pike been sitting in my chair ?
could be . why ? is it broken ?
you want me to find out
if he &apos;s been sleeping in your bed , too ?
were you looking for me ?
what about your food ?
dr. pike , have you been eating maura &apos;s porridge ?
of course not .
i &apos;m glad that you think you &apos;re so funny .
it &apos;s better to be funny than poindexter the know @-@ it @-@ all .
well , i &apos;d rather be poindexter the know @-@ it @-@ all
than the hoi polloi .
good one , maura .
you don &apos;t even know what it means .
it means &quot; common . &quot;
literal translation is , &quot; the great unwashed . &quot;
classy .
hide your insults in latin .
it &apos;s greek .
oh , the geek that knows greek .
do you realize how ridiculous you sound ?
you know , people laugh at you behind your back .
really ?
well , they call you a bitch behind yours .
yes , i &apos;m keeping a safe distance .
i &apos;m gonna have to put you on speaker .
well , at least when my father gets pissed off ,
he doesn &apos;t stab people with an ice pick !
well , at least my father didn &apos;t move to florida
to sleep with some floozie he met at a pizza parlor !
maura .
or was it a massage parlor ?
oh , look at you !
going all trailer @-@ trash @-@ snooki ...
i watched that show once !
give me that .
once ! it was for ethnographic research !
break it up , ladies . what &apos;s going on ?
what the hell is happening in your house , lieutenant ?
i &apos;ve got it under control .
i can see that -- a homicide detective
and a medical examiner having a cat fight
that needs police intervention !
a cat fight ?
did you really just call a disagreement
between female colleagues a cat fight ?
actually , aggression between two females is --
oh , for the love of pete , stop !
i want detective rizzoli placed on leave .
i &apos;ll go one step better .
rizzoli , i &apos;m transferring you out of homicide .
what ?
what ?
you got 30 seconds
to get your ass over to evidence management .
place me on leave ! don &apos;t send me there !
go now !
what about dr. isles ?
she was part of the cat fight , too .
you &apos;re in charge now .
i am ?
what &apos;s in that envelope ?
my resignation .
oh , no .
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
this isn &apos;t a burglary .
somebody was looking for something .
did your father ever mention a book ?
no .
but captain connors is looking for it , too .
we have paddy .
and if he lives , he can name all the dirty cops himself .
why do you need the book ?
because paddy doyle will never testify .
that &apos;s why he &apos;s still alive .
but if you could get your hands on that book ,
you can run boston .
how ?
there &apos;s more than dirty cops on paddy &apos;s payroll --
city workers , politicians , maybe even judges .
frankie , call operations .
i want you to stay with dr. isles .
jane didn &apos;t know dean would be there .
is that why you resigned ?
i &apos;m the daughter of a mobster .
you &apos;re all under investigation for trying to protect me .
if you &apos;re done with the crossword puzzle , detective ,
how about you break down these seized guns ?
parts go in the evidence barrel here .
that better be vodka or strychnine .
whoa .
you &apos;re melting down a desert eagle ?
what a waste .
unless you want to sneak it out in your pants .
there &apos;s no room .
come on . i feel like shooting stuff .
you sure ?
i am an evidence clerk .
i need to test @-@ fire these weapons .
now , let &apos;s live dangerously . take the whole box .
we &apos;re gonna -- you know , with these guns .
just a little test fire .
yeah !
i could do this all day .
right .
sleep with a federal agent .
forget to put a bolo out for paddy doyle .
have a cat fight .
he didn &apos;t really say that .
oh , yes , he did .
well , you gals do tend to do a lot of squealing
when you get upset .
shut up .
hey , frost .
look at the lands and grooves on this bullet .
this is the bullet from the desert eagle in evidence .
and this is the one from wally &apos;s back .
no doubt about it -- these are from the same gun .
that means this is the gun that killed wally .
which means the killer is someone in bpd .
come in .
sir , there &apos;s something you need to see .
i was starting to worry about you , rizzoli .
what took you so long ?
you put me there on purpose , didn &apos;t you ?
we suspected paddy had someone in evidence ,
so , figured who best to keep an eye on things
than pissed @-@ off jane rizzoli ?
we get caught ,
we &apos;re here to get wally &apos;s dress uniform
to bury him in , got that ?
got it .
how much overtime was wally doing ?
is that a pepperbox derringer ?
wally &apos;s bought himself a dive shop .
that &apos;s belize !
i always wanted to go fishing there .
except it &apos;s catch and release .
you don &apos;t even eat fish .
be nice to mount a big tuna .
a big tuna ?
do you hear yourself ?
um ... why does wally
have all this money to buy a dive shop and mount a tuna ?
looks like he was playing a different game .
you know who these two altar boys are ?
the kid on the left is wally . the taller one is paddy .
we heard some chatter on the wire
that paddy was about to make a big score
before he got hit .
what , you thinking it was seized guns ?
yeah , i do .
bpd seizes close to a thousand guns a year .
good scam .
cops seize the guns , paddy takes them from us .
a million bucks right there
if you can figure a way to get it out of here .
how ?
they &apos;re logged in , weighed ,
and dropped into these barrels .
armored car takes them away to be melted down .
they don &apos;t even tell
command staff when they &apos;re moving them .
maybe paddy was intercepting the trucks .
think we &apos;d have heard about it .
you know , dean told me something .
okay . don &apos;t tell us what you were doing when he told you .
i want to hear what they were doing .
the fbi thinks cops on paddy &apos;s payroll
were about to make that move .
now would be the time with paddy in the i.c.u.
first to go , paddy &apos;s boy , wally .
they can &apos;t do anything without the guns .
let &apos;s find them .
wally swapped this one out with scrap metal .
oh , my god !
what the hell is going on ?
i &apos;m sorry , john .
me too .
cliff was my partner . i trusted him .
looks like it could be a .44 .
this is a .44 .
the desert eagle .
probably the same gun he used to kill wally .
then somebody used it on him .
what do we do now ?
seal the drum .
put it back where it was .
rizzoli , put that gun back .
what ?
until we find out who &apos;s behind this .
if homicide starts investigating cliff &apos;s murder ,
whoever ran this will go underground .
well , wait a second .
if the barrels are full of scrap metal and ... cliff ,
where are the guns ?
this place is the size of four football fields .
it &apos;ll take all night .
where would wally hide them ?
here -- here it is . here it is .
oh , wally had a sense of humor .
they hid their stash in paddy &apos;s boxes .
everything stays put for now , got it ?
let &apos;s lock it up and get out of here .
wait . look at this .
these are surveillance photos of doyle from 1976 .
do you think that &apos;s the harvard babe ?
ma , where is it ?
where is what ?
that really creepy drawing that maura gave you .
where is it ? get it .
why ?
just get it . i promise i won &apos;t hurt it .
please .
oh , my god ! who is she ?
maura .
maura is fine , patrick .
maura .
hope .
who is this ?
it &apos;s maura &apos;s mother .
what &apos;s her name ?
i don &apos;t know . i never knew .
he drew this ?
yeah , he showed up at my art class at harvard .
i thought he was a student .
i tried to encourage him .
then he just -- he disappeared .
and then , what , you found yourself pregnant with maura ?
no .
paddy showed up months later
with a newborn in his arms .
he said the baby &apos;s mother had died during childbirth .
why didn &apos;t his family take maura ?
his father would have killed the baby .
he didn &apos;t trust anybody ... but me .
why did he draw this ?
they used to meet at the boston cemetery .
it &apos;s the only place they were safe from his father .
paddy told everyone that maura and her mother had died .
what if maura &apos;s mother is still alive ?
i think a parent would do anything to keep his child safe .
even lie to the woman he loved and tell her her baby died ?
even that .
jane .
shh , ma .
good work , detective . where is it ?
no .
no book .
oh , i found something else .
it looks like you &apos;re the dirty cop .
and you killed your partners wally and cliff .
i &apos;ll see you in hell , you son of a bitch .
looking forward to it , paddy .
i could scream .
go ahead . my guys are on the door .
smart . my fingerprints are all over that thing .
well , i &apos;m lucky like that , detective .
you got any last words ?
yeah .
you feeling lucky right now ?
no firing pin .
i took them out of all the guns .
that &apos;s not luck . that &apos;s just covering my bases .
get your hands on your head !
you heard him , get them up !
you &apos;re not gonna have to wait for hell
to see your buddy , paddy .
you okay ?
yeah .
good work , rizzoli .
now get out of those khakis and get back to homicide .
thanks , boss .
and you get better so we can move you to walpole .
i want to know something . would you have shot her ?
yeah .
you &apos;re a cop .
i got something i need to show you .
i always wondered why she never looked for me .
is there anything i can do ?
please go .
wait .
there is one thing .
