guess who i found at lax . my baby sister priya .
it &apos;s really nice to see you again , leonard .
yeah , it &apos;s good to see you , too .
here you go .
thanks .
you slept with my sister ? !
yeah .
this is a terrible betrayal of my trust !
would it help if i told you
that i offered her my heart ,
and she kinda stomped on it ? !
how hard did she stomp ?
very hard .
okay , i &apos;m good .
what &apos;s so funny ?
nothing . just thinking
about the noises people make during sex .
i do sometimes get a bit carried away , don &apos;t i ?
it &apos;s cute .
you sound a little like a drunken monkey .
you know it &apos;s meant as a compliment .
that &apos;s how i take it .
this is perfect .
i hope this moment never ends .
me , too .
well , gotta go . oh !
already ? why don &apos;t you stay over ?
i &apos;d love to , but you know
my mother needs me in the morning .
please . i think the woman can manage
to put a wig on by herself .
it &apos;s not just the wig .
it &apos;s pinning her hair up , drawing on her eyebrows .
it &apos;s a two @-@ person job .
it &apos;s just , when you leave right after we make love ,
it makes me feel ...
cheap .
oh , honey , i &apos;m sorry .
what can i do ?
stay .
okay .
like , what , another five , ten minutes ?
go home .
your call .
howard ...
have you ever considered us living together ?
boy , i don &apos;t know .
you , me , ma living under the same roof ?
no , i mean just you and me .
you can move in here ,
or we can find a place .
i &apos;ve got a better solution .
what ?
we wait for my mom &apos;s heart to explode
from all the salt she eats .
then we just stick her in the ground , flip her mattress
and move into the big bedroom .
great .
look at us planning a future together !
who &apos;s there ? !
are you a sex criminal ? !
sex criminals don &apos;t have keys , ma !
where were you so late ? !
i was out with bernadette !
i know what that means !
i watch dr. phil !
i hope to god you used a condom !
i &apos;m not having this conversation with you , ma !
god forbid you get one of those new fancy sex diseases !
nobody has a disease !
i hope not !
i share a toilet with you !
is that what you want ? !
to give your mother herpes ? !
that &apos;s it ! i don &apos;t have to take this !
good luck with your eyebrows in the morning !
who &apos;s there ? !
are you a sex criminal ? !
i &apos;m still leaving !
i just forgot my claritin !
hey , what &apos;s up ?
i need a place to crash .
uh , sure .
why ?
big fight with my mother .
still arguing over which csi is the best ?
no , we agreed they all have their merits .
this was about bernadette .
what &apos;s going on ?
howard &apos;s gonna sleep here tonight .
he had a fight with his mother .
did you offer him a hot beverage ?
no .
leonard , social protocol states when a friend is upset ,
you offer them a hot beverage , such as tea .
tea does sound nice .
you heard the man , leonard .
and while you &apos;re at it , i &apos;m upset
that we have an unannounced houseguest , so make me cocoa .
point of inquiry ,
given that leonard is your secondary friend
and koothrappali is your primary friend ,
why didn &apos;t you seek refuge under his roof ?
there &apos;s no room .
his sister is staying with him .
wait , wait . what ?
cocoa , leonard . focus .
i &apos;m down in the dumps here .
priya &apos;s in town ?
yeah , some work thing .
anyway , my mother seems to think that bernadette ...
hold on . when did priya get here ?
i don &apos;t know . a couple of days ago .
the thing is , bernadette doesn &apos;t like that i have to take care
of my mother , and my mother doesn &apos;t trust bernadette ...
yeah , that &apos;s a real pickle .
bye .
don &apos;t worry .
as your tertiary friend ,
i am prepared to step in and comfort you .
that &apos;s not really necessary .
no , no . i &apos;ll finish making the tea ,
while you narcissistically ramble on
about whatever &apos;s troubling you .
thanks .
that &apos;s what tertiary friends are for .
who is it ?
it &apos;s leonard .
you can &apos;t come in .
i just want to talk to her .
i forbid it .
open the door , rajesh .
you heard me .
i forbidded it .
&quot; forbidded &quot; it ?
&quot; forbaded &quot; it ?
get out of the way .
what are you doing here ?
what are you doing here ?
i have business in los angeles .
why didn &apos;t you call ?
clearly , she was sending you a message
to take a hike , mike .
i &apos;m sorry . i thought about calling ,
but i just wasn &apos;t sure if seeing you was such a good idea .
i know . last time i came on too strong .
can we talk in private ?
no !
sure .
it &apos;s completely inappropriate for a single woman
to entertain a man in private .
if you insist on talking , you must do it on the couch !
all right , you may talk in the bedroom ,
but i want this door to remain open !
all right , just this once you may close the door .
but keep in mind i &apos;ll be right out here
monitoring the situation !
oh , damn it .
leonard , when you get this message , call me .
priya , this is your brother .
when you get this , tell leonard to check his voicemail .
would you be sleeping over again this evening ?
because you &apos;re welcome to .
that &apos;s very nice of you , but i made other plans .
well , just keep in mind that should you ever need
a slightly apathetic tertiary friend ,
i stand at the ready .
hi , howard . hi , sheldon .
hello .
hey .
why are you holding hands ?
i forbid you to hold hands .
rajesh , you know leonard and i spent the night together .
yeah , but you were just sleeping ,
because i forboded you to have sex .
the word is &quot; forbade &quot; &quot;
you sure ? that doesn &apos;t sound right .
listen , rajesh , leonard and i have decided
to see each other again ,
and you don &apos;t get to tell me
who i can and can &apos;t have a relationship with .
actually , he can .
the hindu code of manu is very clear in these matters .
if a woman &apos;s father is not around ,
the duty of controlling her base desires falls
to the closest male member of her family , in this case , raj .
the code also states
that if she disobeys , she will be reborn
&quot; in the womb of a jackal and tormented by diseases . &quot;
if true ,
that seems like an awfully large gamble
given that the prize is leonard .
there it is , priya . we &apos;re indian .
we believe this stuff .
i think it also says that if you eat beef ,
you need to live with cows for three months
and drink their urine .
some of it makes sense , some of it &apos;s crazy .
my point is , you can &apos;t go out with leonard .
who can &apos;t go out with leonard ?
my sister .
penny , this is raj &apos;s sister , priya .
it &apos;s very nice to meet you .
oh , yeah , you , too .
priya , if you &apos;re experiencing any tension or awkwardness ,
it may stem from the fact that leonard and penny used to--
if i may quote howard-- &quot; do the dance with no pants . &quot;
sheldon !
really ?
hey , bernadette , can i talk to you for a second ?
sure .
penny , you became disenchanted with leonard
as a lover .
would you please tell my sister why ?
listen , my mom &apos;s going to palm springs
to visit her sister .
that &apos;s two whole nights in a row i can sleep over
with you all the way to morning .
unless the desert air dries out her sinuses ,
in which case i &apos;ll have to schlep out there
with the big humidifier .
that &apos;s it ?
that &apos;s your big solution to all of our problems ?
if your mom &apos;s nose holds up , we get two nights together ?
isn &apos;t that great ?
no , it &apos;s not great .
you need to make a choice.me or your mother .
wrong answer .
no , wait .
you didn &apos;t let me finish .
i &apos;m listening .
i came as quickly as i could .
okay .
why ?
to comfort you , of course .
sheldon told me about leonard dating rajesh &apos;s sister .
so i high @-@ tailed it over here
to pick up the pieces of your broken heart .
amy , i &apos;m fine .
you don &apos;t have to be strong for me .
now let &apos;s talk about priya , that man @-@ stealing bitch .
what ?
in situations like this ,
best girlfriends are often catty about the other woman .
really , i am not upset about leonard and priya .
oh . then perhaps you don &apos;t understand what &apos;s going on .
your former boyfriend has replaced you
with what appears to be a very suitable mate .
arguably much more suitable than you .
oh . well , good for him .
hey , what do you mean , &quot; more suitable &quot; ?
well , granted , penny , your secondary sexual characteristics
are reasonably bodacious .
but priya is highly educated ,
she &apos;s an accomplished professional , she comes from the culture
that literally wrote the book on neat ways to have sex .
whereas you , on the other hand , are a community college dropout
who comes from the culture that wrote the book on tipping cows .
yeah . okay , i got it . i got it .
so ... what is all that stuff ?
this is a portable electroencephalogram .
i &apos;m doing research on emotions and brain activity .
so when you start crying ,
i can see which region of the brain is activated .
then i &apos;m going to stimulate the analogous area
in the brain of a rhesus monkey and see if he cries .
cool , huh ?
i choose you .
really ?
yep . i moved out of my mother &apos;s house .
cord is cut.i &apos;m all yours .
what did she say when you told her ?
i don &apos;t know . she hasn &apos;t responded to my email yet .
this is so great .
i love you , howard .
i love you , too .
so what &apos;s for dinner ?
well , i don &apos;t really have much of anything in the house .
that &apos;s fine .
why don &apos;t we go fool around in our bedroom ?
and then you can go shopping .
i thought maybe after we eat , we could see an early movie .
i &apos;d love that .
i love the way you say , &quot; i &apos;d love that . &quot;
she says it the same way i do .
&quot; i &apos;d love that . &quot;
everybody in india says it that way.it &apos;s not a big deal .
rajesh , don &apos;t be a child .
i &apos;m not being a child .
leonard , i swear to god ,
if your sister ever comes to town ,
i shall have my way with her .
my sister &apos;s 38 and married .
all the more shame that will fall upon the house of hofstadter .
ooh , i thought i smelled pizza .
that &apos;s remarkable .
if pepperoni were an explosive substance ,
you could replace german shepherds at our nation &apos;s airports .
hi . penny , right ?
oh , yes . h @-@ hi . i &apos;m sorry .
i didn &apos;t know you had company . i don &apos;t want to impose .
no , no . it &apos;s not an imposition .
at this point , in our ecosystem , you are akin to the plover ,
a small scavenging bird that eats extra food
from between the teeth of crocodiles .
please , fly into our open maw , and have at it .
if i had more than a box of baking soda in my refrigerator ,
i wouldn &apos;t have to take that .
hi , bestie .
hi .
so , um , priya , you &apos;re a lawyer , right ?
i know . pretty boring , huh ?
oh , come on . it &apos;s not boring at all .
she &apos;s currently helping set up a secondary derivative market
which would allow overseas car firms to hedge their investments
against potential advancements in battery technology .
thank you , leonard .
that doesn &apos;t make it sound boring at all .
i &apos;m sorry , but ...
so , how you holding up ?
i &apos;m fine .
oh , who are you kidding ? she &apos;s breathtaking .
so , penny ,
leonard tells me you &apos;re an actress .
that must be pretty exciting .
oh , yeah , yeah . it &apos;s real great .
today i drove to van nuys for an audition
i thought was going to be for a cat food commercial .
turned out to be porn .
did you get the part ?
i didn &apos;t do the audition .
given the state of your career ,
can you really afford to be picky ?
i took acting classes when i was at cambridge .
i loved it .
we did taming of the shrew .
oh , wow . i love taming of the shrew .
i did a paper on it in high school .
&quot; who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting ?
in his tail . &quot;
&quot; in his tongue &quot;
&quot; whose tongue ? &quot;
&quot; yours , if you talk of tails ,
and so farewell . &quot;
&quot; what , with my tongue in your tail ? &quot;
i &apos;m regretting my earlier cattiness .
she is an absolute delight .
wow .
wow , indeed .
i can &apos;t believe we &apos;re finally living together .
yeah .
you know what would make this moment perfect ?
what ?
a little snack . you got any string cheese ?
no . i @-@ i might have some cheddar .
not as good .
you can &apos;t make strings with it .
remind me to put it on your shopping list .
okay .
you have hypo @-@ allergenic detergent ?
no .
better put it on the list .
if you wash my underwear with regular soap ,
i get little red bumps on my tuchus .
wait a second .
i &apos;m doing your laundry ?
well , honey , it &apos;s not gonna do itself .
oh , before i forget ,
tomorrow morning , you &apos;re driving me to the dentist .
i have to take you ?
you don &apos;t have to take me . you get to take me .
wait a minute . are you telling me
your mother usually takes you to the dentist ?
it &apos;s not weird .
there &apos;s lots of kids there with their moms .
i can &apos;t believe this .
what ? it &apos;s fun .
if i have no cavities ,
afterwards , we go out for a treat .
all right , howard ,
let &apos;s get something straight right now .
i &apos;m not going to be your mother .
whoa , whoa , whoa !
where did that come from ?
who &apos;s that ? !
is it a sex criminal ? !
nobody wants to do that to you , ma !
where were you ? !
didn &apos;t you read my email ? !
you know i can &apos;t turn on that ferkakta computer !
i left you some brisket on the kitchen counter !
thank you !
remember to floss after .
we have the dentist in the morning !
oh , hey . what &apos;s up ?
i just wanted to check in on you .
why ?
it seems like the appropriate thing to do
when one &apos;s best friend finds herself replaced
by a smart , beautiful woman
with the smoldering sexuality of a crouched bengal tiger .
i already told you , i &apos;m okay with it .
i mean , if anything , i &apos;m quite pleased
that leonard has found someone
that makes him so happy .
it &apos;s okay , it &apos;s okay .
thank you .
now , let &apos;s get these electrodes attached
and see what &apos;s going on in that pretty little noggin of yours .
okay .
i smell chinese food .
it &apos;s actually thai .
you &apos;re slipping .
are leonard and priya here ?
they went to catalina for the weekend .
oh . where &apos;s raj ?
at home , forbidding it .
how about howard ?
i &apos;m given to understand
his mother grounded him for running away .
oh , okay .
well , i guess it &apos;s just the two of us , huh ?
actually , it &apos;s the three of us .
what up , bestie ?
good news .
thanks to you , i was able to make a rhesus monkey cry
like a disgraced televangelist .
great .
so , you feeling better ?
not really .
sheldon , you have a guest who &apos;s upset .
right . i &apos;ll make tea .
sweetie , it &apos;s okay . i don &apos;t want tea .
