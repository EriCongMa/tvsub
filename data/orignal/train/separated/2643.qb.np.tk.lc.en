forget it .
liz needs all the help she can get .
since when are you interested in helping her ?
all you &apos;ve ever done is betray her .
says the guy who &apos;s hunting her down .
you really think liz is a russian agent , a terrorist ?
if you know where she is ...
i don &apos;t .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m here . look .
i know you don &apos;t trust me .
if it &apos;s any consolation , i don &apos;t trust you , either .
like i said , forget it .
don &apos;t you want to know the truth ?
don &apos;t you want to know what happened ?
easy .
your ex is a wanted killer .
you want to help her , let me do my job .
i know you care ... about liz .
you can act like you don &apos;t , but i know you do .
let me help . i can go places .
i can do things .
break the law ?
work around it .
next time , i break that arm .
we were out .
you said the ship we were on was headed to spain .
change of plans .
because ?
because after far too much time playing defense ,
today &apos;s the day we switch to offense .
take a look around .
we are hardly in prime position
to be fighting anyone right now .
the director needed permission to have me killed .
and he only got it by convincing others
that i didn &apos;t have the fulcrum .
that was a costly mistake .
and now members of the cabal will be exposed
as a result of investigations .
his own people are questioning his leadership .
we need to capitalize on that
by wreaking such havoc on the cabal
that they will choose to exonerate you
and sacrifice the director .
how is that ever gonna happen ?
our journey begins in the home of the double @-@ bacon corn dog .
welcome to iowa .
what do you know about verdiant industries , lizzy ?
nothing .
they &apos;re the world &apos;s largest agribusiness .
they sell seeds .
more to the point , genetically engineered seeds .
in fact , they &apos;re the single largest manufacturer
of genetically engineered seeds on earth ,
and not just any seeds .
corn , soy ,
the crops at the very foundation of our food economy .
i &apos;ve read about this .
modifying the dna of the seed itself ,
teaching it to create a protein
that kills common pests that would eat it .
yes , and those seeds are very expensive .
most small farmers can &apos;t afford them .
many of them have been driven out of business .
and when people feel their homes and livelihoods threatened ,
violence is never far behind .
a few days ago , a verdiant facility
was attacked by a group of small farmers
who call themselves los segadores ,
men determined to kill verdiant
before it kills them .
damaging one building will hardly kill verdiant .
they did more than damage a building , lizzy .
they stole data , a cache of proprietary files
detailing how verdiant modifies its corn genome .
that &apos;s a trade secret worth billions of dollars .
you and i are gonna take those files
from the men who stole them .
assuming we could do that ,
why would we ?
verdiant launders money for the cabal .
hundreds of millions of dollars a year .
if we get those files ,
we have leverage over verdiant .
we have leverage over verdiant ,
we have leverage over the cabal .
i know how mr. reddington and agent keen got out of the diner
where the standoff happened .
the tunnels , the ones they used to escape from the diner ,
they were built to sneak in contraband
from the port of baltimore .
coordinate with the mpa .
i want a full accounting of all ships--
already did .
one particular freighter caught our attention .
the dmc peña set sail 48 minutes
after the siege of the diner ended
en route to the spanish port of valencia ,
but 70 miles into their journey ,
they turned back to the u.s. , citing engine trouble .
where &apos;s the freighter now ?
they docked at norfolk late last night .
according to the cargo manifest ,
only one thing came off the ship .
container number 358202 was offloaded
and placed on a westbound flatbed at 12 : 23 a.m.
stowed away in a corrugated sardine can .
the glamorous life of an international fugitive .
i want to know where that truck &apos;s headed .
find that crate .
what is it ?
dembe .
this is the rendez @-@ vous point .
something &apos;s wrong .
we &apos;re gonna need transportation .
this &apos;ll do .
i &apos;m not talking to you .
dembe &apos;s missing .
they were here . the fbi .
when ?
when ?
what does it matter when ? they were here .
and when i refused to answer their questions ,
they took me in .
don &apos;t try my patience , glen .
i &apos;m sorry , red . i &apos;m hypoglycemic .
my blood sugar crashed and i just lost it .
glen .
i must &apos;ve spent six hours in the box .
i nearly had a stroke .
what did you tell them ?
i didn &apos;t have my crackers with me , i couldn &apos;t get a juice box .
i rolled , red . i &apos;m sorry .
i told them everything .
everything ?
i &apos;m yanking your crank .
what do you think i am , a snitch ?
i &apos;m clean as a whistle ,
which is more than i can say for your shorts .
i can hear you dropping a steamer through the phone .
we got wheels .
safety !
okay .
dembe .
what &apos;s the 911 ?
you &apos;re a fool .
you think because you would risk your life to save reddington ...
... that he &apos;s gonna do the same ?
he won &apos;t .
reddington won &apos;t come for you .
you are protecting a man that has left you for dead .
we have a colleague of yours .
he &apos;s being prepared .
unless you tell me where i can find reddington ...
he will suffer .
nothing ?
so be it .
what you hear next is a consequence of your misplaced loyalty .
please , no !
gentlemen .
a moment of your time .
eduardo !
i wouldn &apos;t .
you &apos;re members of los segadores , am i right ?
a simple nod is acceptable .
excellent .
i was hoping to have a word with your leader .
that &apos;s me .
i don &apos;t believe so .
i was told to speak with a man named eli matchett .
what are you , cops ?
goons working for verdiant ?
either way , i &apos;m not telling you --
the next one goes in your leg .
eli matchett .
he &apos;s gone .
gone where ?
i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t !
look , verdiant has a warehouse up in silver ridge
doing some top @-@ secret research .
we were working on how to take it out when eli --
he just snapped .
started saying how we were a joke ,
how none of us had the balls to make a real impact .
so he walked .
next we hear , nine people are dead .
you think matchett is responsible ?
we got a guy on the inside at verdiant .
gabriel costa .
if eli did this , he had costa &apos;s help .
we &apos;re gonna need mr. costa &apos;s address
and maybe some directions .
my associate prefers to steal cars
made before the advent of gps .
were you able to crack the server files ?
all 5 billion nucleotide pairs .
verdiant &apos;s patented prize pig .
i &apos;m uploading the file to a couple dozen hosting sites .
look , i know we agreed to open source this ,
but this is verdiant &apos;s most guarded trade secret .
it &apos;s worth a fortune .
so what ?
you want to sell to the highest bidder ?
i want to get back what that seed cost me .
my farm , my family .
yeah .
we sell and get back our losses , but no one else &apos;s .
this doesn &apos;t belong to verdiant , it doesn &apos;t belong to us .
we release to everyone .
sorry , friends .
but i got something else in mind .
克斯比 爱荷华州
sure is one hell of a sardine can .
man does have style .
aram .
i found something on the a.p.
a bombing in fairfield
at a facility owned by verdiant industries .
reddington comes to town a few days after a major attack ?
that &apos;s not a coincidence .
i thought the same thing .
so , i cross @-@ referenced every senior @-@ level employee
with mr. reddington &apos;s file , and i came up with one name .
verdiant c.t.o. susan hanover .
why do i know that name ?
because it was listed in the fulcrum .
25 years ago , hanover was a low @-@ level staffer on the hill .
a bombing with a direct link to the cabal .
that &apos;s why reddington &apos;s in town .
how many employees were lost ?
we think 15 .
nine are confirmed dead ,
the other six are officially listed as unaccounted for .
they say some of the bodies are , uh , unidentifiable .
you &apos;ve been hit before ?
the company , yeah , but not this facility ,
and never like this .
there &apos;s a group , calls itself los segadores .
up to now , it &apos;s only been property damage .
so why the escalation ?
because certain secure terminals
can only access the company mainframe during business hours .
whoever did this accessed our proprietary files .
they downloaded information
detailing how we modify our genomes .
that &apos;s a trade secret worth billions of dollars .
this was a robbery .
if that data is released publicly ,
it &apos;s only a matter of time
before our product is being mass produced on the black market .
the price of our product will fall permanently .
our stock won &apos;t recover .
sir .
uh , sorry to interrupt ,
but i just received a call from the medical examiner .
what is it ?
they ran preliminary dna tests on the remains recovered inside ,
and everyone was accounted for except for one employee .
a , uh , gabriel costa .
that &apos;s not possible .
his badge was used to swipe in that morning .
he was here .
unless he walked out with the attackers .
maybe gabriel costa &apos;s our inside man .
how long do you need ?
delivery system &apos;s done .
now it &apos;s just two more hours
for the completion of the replication period ,
and you &apos;ll have your virus .
costa isn &apos;t here .
then we look for anything that may reveal his whereabouts .
i don &apos;t know what happened .
i used to consider myself lucky .
i had a husband i loved , a job i always wanted .
i was the kind of person good things happen to .
have you ever heard of mugs kalinowski ?
lovely guy .
ugliest man i ever laid eyes on .
that &apos;s why everyone called him mugs .
except his dear mother .
she was an art professor at bard .
lovingly referred to him as picasso .
that &apos;s kind of sweet , actually .
well , it was an apt nickname .
his face was ...
all over the place .
but perhaps as a result of that nickname ,
mugs grew up with a great appreciation for art .
he fenced some of the most extravagant pieces in the world .
he only had one rule .
out of respect for dear mom , he &apos;d never lift a picasso .
felt it was bad luck .
then one day , he got a tip from a source
about a piece sitting in a huge loft in soho .
so one evening , mugs shimmied up the drain pipe ,
broke in , and lo and behold ,
there hung on the wall , &quot; les femmes d &apos;alger . &quot;
a spectacular picasso .
one of a series of 15 and astronomically valuable .
did he take it ?
no .
and mugs was convinced that was the single
biggest stroke of bad luck he &apos;d ever suffered .
well , what he didn &apos;t know was
the source who &apos;d given him the tip
was working with the feds .
the painting had a tracking device on it .
sometimes , bad luck is the best luck you &apos;ll ever have .
what ever happened to mugs ?
did he land on his feet ?
unfortunately , no .
mugs had borrowed $ 500,000 from a loan shark
against the value of the painting .
when he didn &apos;t steal it , he couldn &apos;t pay it back .
a few weeks later , the loan shark shot him dead .
there &apos;s something going on with that vent .
time to go .
i don &apos;t understand . how did they find us ?
they didn &apos;t , and they won &apos;t .
we need a drill .
forget about the box .
we need to leave .
they &apos;re one step behind us .
this is the life , lizzy .
someone &apos;s always one step behind .
aram , i &apos;m sending you a photo . i want it sent wide .
it &apos;s not aram .
keen ?
why are you doing this ?
it &apos;s my job .
you know me .
you know i &apos;ve been framed .
if you &apos;re innocent , come in . let me help you .
we know about the verdiant attack .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re here , isn &apos;t it ?
i &apos;m just trying to get my life back .
verdiant is connected to the cabal .
reddington thinks that if we get enough leverage ...
reddington &apos;s not capable of telling the truth .
you know that .
if you &apos;re interested in the truth , back off .
let me do what i have to do to clear my name .
no .
you were at costa &apos;s apartment .
i &apos;m getting close , aren &apos;t i , keen ?
keen ?
you were right .
reddington and liz were here . we just missed them .
was there a surveillance camera ?
no , but i pulled this off a responding officer &apos;s dash cam .
he was dispatched to meet us at the scene .
it looks like he blew right past them .
run that plate . find out who that vehicle belongs to .
put out an alert for the car .
looks like costa was copying verdiant documents
and feeding them to matchett and his crew .
he kept this ledger to keep track of the documents he stole .
he &apos;s got internal memos here
tracking some development project called genesis .
he was sending them to a feed store in wilson park ?
wait , wait , look .
we can &apos;t just go charging in there .
we had a hard enough time handling the cabal
when the f.b.i. was backing us , let alone hunting us down .
don &apos;t be anxious . we &apos;re still a step ahead .
i &apos;m not anxious .
i &apos;m scared .
where are we ?
400 tiny viral vectors
ready to be released into the wild .
imagine .
you can hold in one hand everything you need
to bring humanity to its knees .
table for one ?
or are you waiting on the rest of your party ?
no , just me . this order &apos;s to go .
is the chicken gorgonzola gluten @-@ free ?
i believe so .
you believe , or you know for sure ?
because although that may just be
a small lexical distinction for you ,
for me , it &apos;ll determine whether i spend my entire evening
on the can with two rolls of triple ply .
why don &apos;t i ask the chef ?
rover keypad .
four @-@ digit pin . could be thousands of combinations .
only if you don &apos;t know the four digits .
now there &apos;s only 24 combinations .
gabriel costa .
agent navabi .
where ?
copy that . wilson park .
have your officers secure the vehicle
and stand down until we get there .
patrol found the car . 355 mission .
what is this place ?
this is it .
this is the genome data they stole from verdiant .
let &apos;s get what we need and go .
已完成5 %
that &apos;s the car .
is that ressler and samar ?
we &apos;re fine . keep working .
已完成20 %
they &apos;re in the building .
how much more time ?
i don &apos;t know .
these files are massive . we should go .
i saw a storm door on the side of the building .
not yet .
已完成63 %
the desk .
we &apos;re not gonna make it .
reddington !
已完成78 %
clear .
已完成93 %
ressler .
think if you stare long enough , it might ring ?
what &apos;s her name ?
elizabeth .
she &apos;s gone .
i was hoping that ...
you know , when we met , she was seeing this other guy .
he worked , i didn &apos;t .
but we started seeing each other anyway .
anyway , we had this , uh ...
signal , way of communicating so he wouldn &apos;t know .
she would call that phone at exactly 7 : 00 p.m. ,
and i &apos;d pick up .
we &apos;d meet .
how &apos;d that work out ?
not so great .
hey , uh , sorry , would you do me a quick favor ?
just if that phone rings , if she calls , would you ...
give her my number ?
i just spoke to the owner of the building .
he said he leased the space to a man named eli matchett
two months ago .
did you get a background ?
i did .
matchett had a farm
hat adjoined one of verdiant &apos;s properties near abingdon .
apparently , some of their seed blew onto his farm .
they claimed he illegally infringed on their patent
and they sued him .
the defense cost matchett a fortune .
must &apos;ve lost everything .
aram , did you get those files ?
you stumbled on a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art virology shop .
matchett didn &apos;t steal verdiant &apos;s genome blueprint
so he could release it publicly .
he needed it to identify its weaknesses
and design a virus tailor @-@ made to destroy it .
he wants to sabotage their gmo crop ?
90 % of all corn grown in america is genetically modified ,
and verdiant is the largest producer of it .
in fact , this one strain is planted all over the world .
if this virus gets out , it will spread fast .
how fast ?
it would cross state lines in weeks , maybe even days .
with months , it would migrate overseas .
if matchett unleashes this virus ,
we could have a global food crisis on our hands .
we &apos;ve got around 90 % , but i &apos;m not sure it &apos;s readable .
we &apos;ll probably need help accessing the data
without a complete download .
how the hell did ressler ...
i called him while you were in the store .
why would you do that ?
i told him to back off because i thought
if he was interested in the truth , maybe --
ressler is a law @-@ enforcement robot . the fbi winds him up .
that &apos;s not true .
he &apos;s a person . he &apos;s a good person .
look at me . you need to let that go , lizzy .
i have survived for a very long time now ,
and i assure you , i didn &apos;t do it
by relying on the goodness in people .
we should go .
i &apos;ll check the parking lot , find us a new ride .
meet me out front in a minute .
yes , sir .
that was gordon pierce at verdiant .
you know that lawsuit against eli matchett ?
yeah , what about it ?
matchett didn &apos;t just lose his farm because of it .
after the bank foreclosed ,
verdiant purchased his property in a short sale .
in fact , they bought out several other places in that area
and turned them into one large industrial farm .
verdiant &apos;s growing gmo corn
on the very land that matchett grew up on .
you think that &apos;s where he plans to unleash the virus ?
i think we just found ourselves ground zero .
must be my lucky day .
drop your gun !
can &apos;t do that .
raymond reddington .
you got any idea how many people want to see you dead ?
some idea , yes .
and you .
you &apos;re the girl on the news .
the russian .
you seem like an intuitive guy .
at least intuitive enough to know when you &apos;re in over your head ,
so whichever lowlife you &apos;re working for ,
he &apos;s gonna have to wait to get his revenge .
set it down .
911 , what &apos;s your emergency ?
what &apos;s your location ?
we have to leave .
we can &apos;t . we &apos;re in the middle of nowhere .
he &apos;ll be dead by the time the ambulance gets here .
i &apos;m not leaving him .
pockets .
help !
we need help here !
single shot to the chest !
he &apos;s breathing , but barely any pulse .
about 15 minutes ago .
yes , but send two more units to ash and 3rd .
we &apos;re five minutes out .
no visual on matchett yet , but state police have locked up
all roads leading into the verdiant property .
reddington was on a ship bound for freedom ,
and he turns it around to come back here for verdiant .
does he really think that taking these guys out
is gonna get him closer to clearing keen &apos;s name ?
do you think he has a family ?
lizzy .
he &apos;s gonna die .
don &apos;t .
you saw that hospital .
they wouldn &apos;t have a thoracic surgeon on call .
they &apos;d have to medivac him to a different county .
you &apos;re right .
thoracic surgeons would be very rare in fairfield , iowa .
what does that tell you ?
focus .
who else would be rare in fairfield ?
a virologist who specializes in gmos .
so , where did eli matchett find one ?
the documents we got from costa --
the ones he stole from verdiant .
they were talking about a special development project --
genesis .
and eduardo this morning at the segadores farm .
he said verdiant was working on some top @-@ secret r &amp; d
at a warehouse in silver ridge .
what are you thinking ?
that agent ressler may be of some use after all .
possible suspect sighted . stand by .
suspect sighted !
headed north !
head him off !
you boys about finished ?
he &apos;s all yours .
ressler .
i just received a cache
of internal research documents from verdiant .
definitely not the kind of stuff they &apos;d want out there .
got them how ? where &apos;d they come from ?
that &apos;s the crazy part .
they came in on the fax hard line .
i think from agent keen .
i think she wants us to search a verdiant warehouse
in silver ridge .
why ?
are you sitting down ?
because you are not gonna believe this .
i don &apos;t understand . what &apos;s the delay ?
what exactly do you know ?
that &apos;s unacceptable .
get me an update .
my god .
you &apos;re raymond reddington .
and you &apos;re susan hanover .
chief technology officer at verdiant industries .
and corporate shill for the cabal .
come on . why don &apos;t we let the boy play ?
i have some bad news , susan .
the virus you helped eli matchett create
has been contained .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
oh , i think you do .
see , i thought eli matchett was verdiant &apos;s greatest enemy .
i assumed he left los segadores
because he wanted to be even more radical ,
but that &apos;s not true , is it , susan ?
the truth is he was co @-@ opted by your company .
you paid him attack that facility .
you wanted him to steal that data .
that &apos;s outrageous .
oh , well , we certainly agree on that .
you provided him with everything he needed ,
including the scientist who synthesized the virus .
okay .
that &apos;s enough .
sit down , susan .
let &apos;s not make a scene in front of the boy .
this virus you &apos;re talking about .
why would we do that ?
why destroy our own product ?
perhaps you were willing to create this disease
because you already possess the cure .
it &apos;s ingenious .
hire a madman to unleash a catastrophic threat ,
and then wait just long enough for the world to panic .
why would we do that ?
for the money , susan .
so you and your company could come rushing in
with a new product at the perfect time ,
a seed immune to the devastating scourge
and available , of course , at a much higher price .
you can &apos;t prove that .
oh , but i can .
i know about the genesis project .
by now , so do the fbi .
at the risk of sounding immodest ,
i &apos;m on their most @-@ wanted list .
number one with a bullet .
they came here looking for me .
unfortunately for you , what they found
were dozens of internal verdiant documents
which will lead them to your warehouse in silver ridge ,
and i don &apos;t need to tell you what they &apos;ll find inside .
a stockpile of new seed waiting to be sold
to a desperate world on the verge of calamity .
you would &apos;ve made a fortune
and looked like heroes in the process .
i knew matchett was a mistake .
never met the man .
wouldn &apos;t judge him too harshly , though .
he seized his chance to terrify the world ,
shine one glorious spotlight on the dangers
of planting the same seed in fields all over the globe .
progress . it &apos;s a bitch .
what do you want ?
i came here to ask you
to deliver a message to your friend , the director .
this is only the beginning , and i won &apos;t stop
until his own people realize
that their only way forward is to exonerate elizabeth keen
and to leave the director to me .
please .
tell him i &apos;m coming .
the verdiant arrest warrants are coming through .
they &apos;re being executed now .
there &apos;s something else .
we just got word liz shot an undercover cop earlier today .
what ?
what happened ?
i &apos;m not sure . the details are still coming in .
but it does look like the guy &apos;s gonna make it .
i shot a cop .
yes , you did .
and killed the attorney general of the united states .
* well , i just found the fence where i &apos;m gonna lean *
yes .
and when you did that ...
you crossed a threshold ,
leaving your world , entering mine .
bad things are gonna find you now , lizzy .
this life ...
has a mind and a momentum of its own .
that &apos;s a reality you need to accept .
* but try to think it my way *
* and say oh , oh , oh *
bad things happen to good people .
am i a good person ?
i &apos;m not so sure anymore .
* this was not my plan *
i &apos;m sure .
reddington obviously thinks
that he can take the fight to the cabal .
but look what happened .
this time , keen shot a cop . the next time ,
she &apos;s gonna be the one getting hurt .
you know , i &apos;ve watched you run the task force all this time ,
i don &apos;t think i ever appreciated how damn hard it was .
i &apos;ll deny it if you ever repeat it ,
but there wasn &apos;t a day when i didn &apos;t feel
like it &apos;s all over my head .
you should trust your instincts , agent ressler .
i do .
tom keen came out of the woodwork .
keen ?
does he know something ?
no . no , he just wants to help .
and did you take it ?
what , are you kidding ?
that guy &apos;s a liability .
yes .
and a loose cannon who would shoot a guilty man in the back
to prevent him from escaping , but in a case like this ,
there could be a place for a man like that .
you tell me to trust my instincts ?
my instincts are telling me
to stay as far away from tom keen as possible .
you know what ?
you &apos;re right .
you should trust your gut , not mine .
after all , look where my instincts got me .
you &apos;re a good agent , donald .
you made the right call .
* oh , oh , oh *
* this was not my plan *
* oh , oh , oh *
* things are not so bad *
* and we say , &quot; oh , oh , oh , it &apos;s a wicked campaign &quot; *
red , yeah , hey , it &apos;s me .
* oh , oh , oh *
it &apos;s about dembe .
we got a problem .
i think he &apos;s been taken .
* we sing oh , oh , oh , our wicked campaign *
the price of silence .
we &apos;re gonna die in here .
thank you .
in case you get tired of waiting .
what would you do to help elizabeth keen ?
how did you find --
what would you do to help her ?
anything .
