"Second Opinion"
Doctors have never had all the answers.
Derek, I don't know.
It isn't just a visit. She's "Back" Back.
It's only been two nights.
As long as she needs.
I mean, she lost someone. She's been through some stuff.
I think she just needs her friends.
She doesn't want to be alone.
There was a time when you were sick,
we'd just drain your blood like you were getting an oil change.
Today is, uh, knee replacement day, right?
Had to cancel them.
We're meeting with our lawyers today about the crash.
Oh. How's that going?
Uh, I'm... not allowed to say.
All right. That's fine.
How's Arizona?
Not allowed to say.
You.
Dr. Bailey. Here you go.
She won't...
Oh, thank you.
See anyone.
She won't even leave the house.
Yeah, and... she's walking.
She's even working with her prosthesis,
but, you know, it has to be perfect.
And I try to be encouraging,
but then she tells me I'm pushing her.
Tell her I say get her ass in here.
Oh... sweet.
Then she can be cranky and resentful to you.
We're constantly having to rethink
what we thought was true...
And redefine it.
Wilson, you stink.
Vomit. It's vomit.
I'm covering the pit, and santa claus came to town.
I don't need a play-by-play. Go clean yourself up.
That's what I'm doing.
Go. You're disgusting.
What is this?
What?
This list your real estate agent sent to mine.
"Repair discolored/burned portion, hardwood floors"?
Oh, that's just some stuff you gotta take care of.
"Repair/refinish wood molding in doorjambs"?
Yeah, they're all scratched up.
There's like five things you gotta fix.
And what if I don't?
Then I'm not buying your house.
Well, that's crazy,
because you begged me to sell you that house.
We made a deal. We shook on it.
We drank on it.
These are reasonable requests. Come on, Mer.
I mean, we're friends, but this is business.
We gotta be like grown-ups here.
Did you just tell me to grow up?
I hate Karev.
Seconded.
Oh, motion carried.
We hate Karev. What happened to you?
I'm covering the pit, and santa claus came to town.
You know, I was starting to think that he was an okay guy,
but he's just mean.
Santa?
Karev.
Santa came in two weeks ago,
and he barfed all over me, too.
He barfed all day.
Did he say anything about me?
Santa?
Karev.
Don't do that. Don't be the sad girl with the hang-up.
It's pathetic.
He slept with Heather. She's not hung up.
Why did you start your year
by having sex with your boss anyway?
'Cause he's stupid hot.
I have social anxiety,
so sometimes it's easier than talking.
Oh. I'm a really good listener.
I'm just sayin'.
Jackasses, all of you.
That was...
So...
So stupid.
Not where I was going.
What is wrong with me?
How many times can I say this is not happening
and then the next thing I know, it's happened?
I am... i'm so weak.
You're not weak. You're just--
Disgusting.
I was a good person once.
A person with willpower.
I have fasted before.
This is worse.
This just feels helpless and inevitable.
Like... like watching two cars head toward one another
and... there's nothing you can do.
There's gonna be a crash.
People are going to die.
And you're just gonna be left there--
Wh--
You are lucky I'm even selling you this house.
You're lucky I'm buying it.
That list is the tip of the iceberg.
I mean, there's dry rot--
There is no dry rot.
Brian Danziger, 17,
He passed out in first period english.
Uh, severe abdominal pain, tremors, and he's hypertensive.
His parents are on the way.
Brian, were you drinking this morning?
Did you take anything?
No, I don't take drugs.
Oh, god! What happened?
He's distended,
and he's got tenderness in the right upper quadrant.
Does he look jaundiced to you?
A little.
Brian, I'm gonna need you to lie back down, please.
Oh. Alex.
Uh, all right.
make sure you get L.F.T.S, coags, a tox screen,
and an abdominal C.T.
Edwards, what do you think this is?
I think...
I'm sorry. I don't know.
That's all right. We don't either.
For all we know, this kid could have dry rot.
I'm sorry I messed you up like that, hon.
I start puking like this, it doesn't stop for days.
Well, I'm gonna give you some fluids
to counteract the alcohol in your system.
I don't have any alcohol in my system.
Mm-hmm. Last time you threw up all over us,
Your alcohol level was .21,
and the time before that, it was even higher.
It does take the--the pain down a notch.
But I-I swear to you, hon, I ain't been drinking nothing.
I mean, I don't know what's wrong with me.
My stomach hurts so bad,
and I just get so nauseous, I just wish I would die.
Please. You--you got to help me.
Well, let's figure it out then.
Okay.
I told you to change your shirt.
What the hell is wrong with you?
This is what I can offer you...
Salary-wise.
That's fine. Thank you.
You don't need to thank me.
Thank Jeff Russell.
He really pushed to get you here.
Who's Jeff Russell?
He's the new cardio chief. He's a good guy.
You'll like him. Or you won't.
Oh, there's a meeting today about the plane crash with the lawyers.
Will you be there?
I will.
So do I have to come?
No, I will be there to support my staff,
not as your proxy.
I'm not your proxy anymore.
All right.
So...
Now here's your orientation packet.
Welcome.
And I'll see you around.
Jamie's appy went perfectly.
Her incision looks great,
but her throat is still giving me cause for concern.
It's just a sore throat, right?
Probably just an infection,
but the swelling is abnormal.
So I want to keep her here another day
and run some tests just to be sure.
Of course. Let's be sure. Thank you.
Yeah.
And of course the kids got to it
before my husband could even try it.
All right, and the judge is tasting it now,
and we are gonna see what you get, Susan.
That is three and a half out of four apples!
Hello.
Hey, Arizona.
It's, uh, Miranda Bailey. How are you?
Well, I'm, you know, I'm--
I-I wish I had time to talk,
but I'm calling for a favor.
I have a 13-year-old female
three days post-appendectomy
with a persistent sore throat and as of this morning,
severe swelling on the left side of her neck.
I-I'm kind of at a loss here.
Get a C.T.
I-I am. I am.
I just thought you might know off the top of your head.
Have you ever seen something like this?
Maybe. I-I mean, I'd have to take a look at the chart.
You know, Bailey, I'm--I'm not really back to work yet,
and--and I'm... busy.
I know, I know. I just...
Wh-what if I have, um, an intern
bring you a copy of the chart?
You take a look.
If it sparks anything, you can call me back.
Well, can't you just e-mail it?
Um, not scanned yet.
Fine. Fine. Just send the chart over.
Oh, thanks so much.
Sir, we have a problem.
You don't have to call me sir.
I do. It helps me.
Sir...
You need to get your Averys straight.
Oh?
in your address book.
Last night...
you sent an e-mail, which I believe was for my mother.
It began, "I can't sleep. Thinking about you tonight"--
Uh, th-that's enough.
Well, it would've been for me, too.
But it really goes on.
Sir, I do not like thinking about you in that way,
or my mother in that way,
or you and my mother in that way.
Message received, son. Won't happen again.
Mnh-mnh. Mnh-mnh. Don't-- don't call me "Son."
I-I meant it colloquially.
That won't happen again either.
Well, I took the liberty of forwarding your e-mail on to my mother.
Uh, thank you for that.
All right. Sir.
You were supposed to tell me
when Brian Danziger's labs came back.
Oh, I thought I was supposed to tell Dr. Karev.
I should've told you, too.
Uh, Brian Danziger's labs are back--
Get away from me.
Oh, not fair. You are the scariest one.
That was always supposed to be me.
You shouldn't have left.
I'll establish dominance.
Maybe I'll use one of the classics.
How was Owen?
You mean Chief Hunt?
The husband formerly known as Owen is now just my employer.
He gave me the orientation packet.
Um, Brian Danziger's sedated.
His B.P.'s down a little.
Yeah, tox screen's negative.
His L.F.T.S and I.N.R. are elevated.
Did you get a good look at his liver?
Oh, the prodigal Yang returns.
We've missed you.
Yes, hi. Blah, blah. Pleasantries.
Hey, uh, what do you know about the new cardio chief--
Jeff Randall?
Russell. Nothing.
Yeah. No one named Jeff has ever done anything substantial.
Hey, Karev, when you buy Mer's house,
can I get my old room back?
Nope. No roommates.
We're not in college. We're real people now.
Wait. You're selling him your house?
I might not. He wants me to rip out the floors.
I'll take the floors as is.
Jackson.
Why don't you shack up with Kepner?
You guys are always boinking anyway.
Where is he going?
Away from you, it seems.
Cristina, glad you're back.
You still doing it with Avery?
Does everybody know this now?
God and everybody.
Four whole seconds I was glad you were back.
Mm. I gotta go and meet this Jeff schmuck.
You were right.
About the floors?
About the liver.
Oh, crap.
You think it's something I did?
With Karev?
Because things were really heating up, and then suddenly,
he stops returning my texts.
He barely talks to me, and I can't figure out what happened.
What happened is, he's a guy.
So you think we're done?
You should be.
Yeah, but is he--
Leah, stop.
Labs for... Santa Claus?
Yeah, that's mine.
What about Shane? He's nice.
Yeah, he is. I wish I liked nice.
Well, then you picked the right guy.
Karev's mean.
And thoughtless and a douche.
And there's nothing wrong with him at all.
Karev?
Santa.
23-year-old female,
37-week gestation,
Echocardiogram reveals Myxoma in the right ventricle--
Dr. Randall?
Uh, Russell.
Sorry. I'm Dr. Yang.
Oh. Holy crap.
You're here.
Jeff Russell.
Make it Jeff.
Jeff it is.
So... this is... great.
Well, I understand you already know your way around,
Probably better than I do, so, um,
Welcome.
And go. Have fun.
See patients.
I thought we might talk.
I wish I had the time.
Dr. Russell--
Jeff.
I am happy to be back at Seattle Grace Mercy West,
but not if my progress ends here.
I think my time would be best spent--
Dr. Yang...
I am in the weeds.
I have a-a huge Myxoma on a pregnant lady,
I am spearheading the first U.S. Lotus Valve Implantation,
I've got four papers
that journals are breathing down my neck for,
I've got an army of interns who could use...
Who need some...
Who are stupid.
Go. Run my service. Make me look great.
Just don't kill my patients.
Who's gonna assign my surgeries?
Um, you are. Call me...
if you do something really cool.
Sir, I'm a fellow.
No, that's not what I've heard.
I've heard you're as good, as capable,
as excited about this work as I am, if not more.
Go.
Be that way.
Myxoma in right ventricle.
Mass measures 3 centimeters...
At this point,
it's about assessing these emotional damages.
So we'll need to hear everything.
You must be Dr.Yang. Glad you could be here.
Have--have a seat.
Dr. Hunt, I guess you won't be necessary as proxy anymore.
Uh, uh, I'm here more out of support for my staff.
Yeah, I don't mind if he stays.
Today, uh, we--we'd like to get some statements about,
continued physical, but--but also mental
or emotional difficulties you might have suffered
since the crash.
What if we don't have any?
Well, um, w-why don't we talk? We'll see what comes up.
Almost anything can be helpful to monetize your injuries.
How do we do that?
We use a formula.
It's, uh...
Your medical bills plus pain and suffering
equal to three times your medical bills
plus flat-rate hard-tissue injuries,
plus loss of income, plus lost earning capacity,
plus any other foreseeable harms,
for each of you.
So we're talking about a sizeable award.
far more substantial than the settlement they offered you.
Where's all the money come from?
Well, we're looking at the possibilities now.
Uh, the charter company, uh, aircraft manufacturer,
parts manufacturers, the pilot, of course.
The ground crew at Sea-tac, um--
Jerry? Did you say Jerry?
Who's Jerry?
The pilot.
He was up there with us.
He broke his back. He's paralyzed now.
You're gonna go after him?
Well, if we find he was negligent, shouldn't we?
You know, I'm sorry. I can't help.
Um, I've got no residual injuries,
and I've gotta go run someone's service for them.
So, you know, good luck.
Folks, listen,
you have a special bond.
You've been through something horrible
and survived it together.
But as far as the pilot is concerned,
you need to stop thinking of him as one of you
and start thinking of him as one of them.
I am Dr. Yang, Dr. Russell's cardiothoracic fellow.
Good to see you back, Dr. Yang.
Have we met?
Um, sort of.
You threw a vaseful of flowers at our heads.
Did I hurt you?
No.
Well, there's still time.
I'm Dr. Ross.
Since many of you will wash out or be fired,
I won't waste time learning your names for at least a year.
I will call you by your dwarf names.
You, happy.
You...
Mousey.
There wasn't a dwarf named mousey.
They saved her for you.
Now get me up to speed-- every patient, every chart.
I want to know this floor better than you do.
Right.
Wrong. You're surgical interns.
No one should know this floor better than you.
You're Dopey now.
She's worse than Medusa.
I hate her.
I heard that.
So we're not sure if it's cancerous,
but there is a mass on his liver, and it is hemorrhaging.
So we'd like to do a biopsy as soon as possible.
All right. Of course.
There's something else. Brian's symptoms--
the jaundice, the hair loss, the high blood pressure--
coupled with a hepatic lesion, it's all consistent
with, uh, the use of anabolic steroids.
What? What the hell?
Brian...
Are you taking steroids?
No.
Have you noticed changes in behavior,
moodiness, depression...
Shut up! Just shut up! I said I don't take them.
Brian.
Unprovoked aggression?
Don't listen to her.
He's not even an athlete.
He's in the model U.N.
Brian, baby...
Just tell me.
If you did it, honey...
just tell me.
I wanted...
Girls only like the guys
with these crazy bodies now.
I wanted a shot at someone liking... me.
Brian, how long have you been taking them?
I swear, I've barely taken any.
For two years.
Since sophomore year,
that's when you stopped being my boy.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I didn't know.
I didn't know.
Wilson, what's the status on our frequent flyer?
Santa?
I don't know. He wasn't lying.
His labs came back negative for drugs and alcohol.
He's dehydrated, but otherwise,
his chem panel's good, his blood sugar's surprisingly good.
Treat him and street him.
I'm sorry?
Santa claus has been coming here for years.
Same symptoms--always drunk, always nauseous.
We always run multiple tests, and they're always negative.
He's looking for drugs.
Give him some antiemetics, give him some food,
and send him on his way.
I just feel like there's more to this--
Wilson, I know you wanted to help.
But you're a surgical intern,
and your skills are needed elsewhere,
and... we need that bed.
Discharge him, please.
It looks like there's nothing wrong with you.
You guys always say that.
There's nothing more we can do.
Just like I'd ever get.
Yeah.
You have blanket I can take?
I--I'm freezing to death.
Stop.
You don't get to have sex with me
and then just walk out
without even so much as a "Have a nice day," okay?
I deserve more respect than that.
What about me?
What about you?
I have to stick around and listen to you
compare sex with me to a fatal car crash?
Hear how repellant, how disgusting...
Oh, my god. No.
No, it is not you.
You are great.
You are not the problem.
Okay. So then...
Okay, so, um...
So you know when there's a dessert train comes around
and you should say no
because it's not nutritious the it's fattening.
And you just, you--you know you shouldn't, but--
but it's right there,
and it's so beautifully made,
and it looks so good.
And you've-- you've had it before.
So you just, you know
how delicious it is.
So it's just right there, you know?
I do. Yeah, I know.
So... so you have it. You have the dessert.
And it is delicious.
I mean, it is...
an amazing dessert...
It is... really good.
For... a moment,
and then you feel tired and bloated
and gassy
and so, so guilty...
Like you just erased all of the exercise
you have ever done,
and tomorrow, you're gonna wake up with zits all over your face.
And Jesus is so disappointed in you again.
And you just--
Are you kidding me?
Hey.
Did you send the chart?
I did, an hour ago.
I told my intern to leave the copies by the door.
Well, did you tell them to ring the bell?
I would've thought that that was a given,
but this year's interns seem more defective than most.
Did you tell me to leave the chart--
Ah. Speak when you're spoken to.
Yeah. Uh, it's outside your door.
Fine.
Would it be safe to say that that surgery,
the one Dr. Torres performed on your hand,
was your last hope at regaining your surgical career?
You could say that.
Dr. Torres, you'd agree
that with the failure of that surgery,
Dr. Shepherd won't be able to--
Okay, I'm sorry. Uh, just to be clear,
the surgery didn't fail.
It--it worked. The graft failed to take.
Th-that was a risk we were willing--
But Dr. Shepherd can no longer operate.
No.
We'd hoped we'd get 100% function--
And it's expected that he will never operate again.
Um, I didn't say that.
But if it is true,
and you can help establish that as a fact,
it would raise the award tremendously, for everyone.
No, in my opinion, Dr. Shepherd won't operate again.
Can we take a break for a minute, please?
Okay.
I am so sorry. I don't know what happened.
The stupid intern's gonna hear about it, though.
No, it's just-- it's a huge...
It's a huge waste of my time!
It is, and I'm sorry.
I will find out what happened to that chart
and get it right over to you.
I'm sorry, but, Dr. Bailey,
you never told me to deliver any chart.
When you are spoken to.
Dr. Yang, listen, if you could give me a-a few minutes.
I really don't have the time or the need
to keep dragging this out.
I-I respect that. That--that's fine.
But you were involved,
and your statement could benefit your colleagues
and their families.
Anything you could say might be helpful.
My shoulder hurts sometimes.
I might have had some P.T.S.D.
You did throw that vase at me.
That is hearsay...
or something.
15 minutes.
Dr. Yang, Dr. Russell's
post-op aortic ulcer patient's coughing up blood.
Did you page Russell?
He's in surgery. He said to page you.
Mousey, suction. Set up for intubation.
Thank you.
Say something that'll make him feel better.
You're gonna be just fine, sir.
Don't oversell it.
What do you think it is?
Could be a fistula. Could be a dissection.
We won't know until we get more studies and open him up.
Yes!
Sorry.
Mousey, get a repeat C.T., stat.
Dopey, prep an O.R.
You guys are both scrubbing in. I need all hands.
Now.
And someone tell Russell that I'm probably opening up
his aortic ulcer.
She's awesome.
I love her.
Get this to path. Get us an answer as quick as you can.
Got it.
So I'm, uh, willing to compromise.
I'm gonna let the ceiling thing go.
Okay, and let the other four things go,
and then we'll have a deal.
We already have a deal.
Why the sudden need to be a homeowner, Alex?
Why the sudden need to be a ballbuster?
Because it's my house. Seriously, why now?
I've been sleeping around a lot with interns.
And you need more space for that?
I just, I--
I'm starting to wonder if I'm gonna be that guy
who graduated from high school
who hangs out in his El Camino looking to nail the freshmen.
I don't want to be that guy.
So don't be that guy.
I know. I gotta grow up a little.
So I stopped calling the interns,
I stopped saying "Dude,"
and now... I just want a place of my own.
You get that, right?
That may just be the dumbest and the saddest thing
I've ever heard you say.
And I've known you a long time.
Sir.
Hmm?
My mother replied to your e-mail.
Oh, dear.
Because I forwarded it to her, she replied to me.
Oh, well...
that's rather graphic, isn't it?
Yeah, she's a wordsmith.
I am asking you both-- begging, actually--
that you keep this from ever happening again.
I'll speak to her.
See that you do.
Sir.
Wilson, why did you order an abdominal C.T. on Santa Claus
when you discharged him an hour ago?
Because I didn't discharge him.
W-well, where is he?
He's right here.
Hey there.
Hey.
Excuse us.
You gave him a C.T. and an extreme makeover.
You're here to do surgery.
I cleaned him up a little.
Because poor people don't get good medical care,
or dirty people or smelly people.
And if he'd come in a good suit and some cologne,
we'd all be busting our asses for him
instead of accusing him of scamming drugs.
I thought, if his scans show he needs a consult,
maybe like this, his next doctor won't blow him off.
C.T.'s been done. Wait for the results.
If they're negative, you send him on his way,
immediately, okay?
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
They're waiting for us.
You all right?
You ever wish we would've just taken the settlement?
Then we wouldn't have to relive this over and over.
Well... none of us wanted to settle.
I did.
We all did. In fact, we voted.
Then why did you agree not to?
You know why.
That's... that's not fair.
It's true, though.
It came down to you, and you agreed.
Because you pushed us.
You came in late with your big speech...
What are you talking--
and you--you did, Derek.
You decided and you pushed...
I did not push you.
And when you do that, no one's gonna go against you.
How was I supposed to stand up?
I did not push you.
And--and you did the same thing with your hand.
What are you talking about?
I told you I did not want to do that surgery.
You suggested that surgery.
Yeah, for someone else, for Schachter.
I wasn't suggesting it for me, and I told you that.
But you wouldn't let up and you made me do it.
Because I thought you could do it!
I believed that you could do it.
That's my fault.
Don't feel bad, Callie. It's on me.
Bailey, it's Robbins.
I have thoughts on your case, many thoughts and ideas,
but I can't tell if they're worthwhile ideas
until I read the chart.
So can you send me the friggin' chart? Please.
Someone suction for me.
I'll do it. I can do it.
Wait. Earn it.
Dopey, what are we looking at on the scans?
It looks like a dissection in the ascending aorta
with an aortobronchial fistula.
Good. You're Happy again. Suction.
Mousey, why did Russell opt for an endovascular repair of this ulcer?
I, uh, personal preference?
Uh, patient's age and limited mobility.
Oh, Happy for the win.
Keep on suctioning.
It's a good choice.
But I've learned that sometimes,
it's better to do things the old-fashioned way.
Mousey, hold this back here, like this.
Good. What do we see here?
It looks like the stent tore through the aorta and bronchus.
Ooh. Mousey coming up from behind.
3-0 prolene.
This is gonna be a mess.
I'm sorry, but there are plenty of other houses in Seattle
for you not to screw interns in.
This is stupid. I'm calling it off.
You can't do that. Escrow's practically closed.
Not my problem.
Neither is "Repaint marks on living room ceiling."
Oh, come on. It's a tiny list.
Good. Then it shouldn't hurt when you stick it up your--
I've got the results back from Path.
It's cancer.
Your scans came back completely clean.
I need you to be honest with me, please.
Did you come in here looking for drugs?
Yeah, I did.
Can you help me out with that?
Okay. Get up. Get dressed.
Can I just get an Aspirin or something?
I mean, any--
Aspirin? You want an Aspirin?
Yeah, I-I get these headaches like my--
my head's been run over by a truck or something.
And the whole world,
It gets--it gets louder and--and brighter.
And I-I-- I just can't move.
Migraines.
You get migraines? Why didn't you say so?
I tried to. I... I was going to, but...
But what?
What is it?
So it's cancer?
Yes.
But the good news is, we got it all.
There is a chance of reoccurrence
if he continues to abuse steroids.
He won't.
He was perfect.
He was skinny, yes, and awkward, but...
funny, smart-alecky...
thoughtful...
Perfect.
Then he forced himself to...
I thought he was just being a teenager
when he changed so much.
If I had known, I'd have stopped him. I swear.
I'd have done anything.
What's the matter with you?
Change your clothes. Now.
Oh, yes. That's it. I have been walking around
in the same vomit-soaked shirt since this morning.
It couldn't be that I've been repeatedly puked on
by a patient who pukes all day,
Despite the fact that I can't find anything wrong with him
except extreme nausea and migraines.
No, I must lack the ability to wash myself
or have absolutely no self-respect.
You know what? Speaking of no self-respect.
Call Leah, please. She is unbearable.
Let her know if you're done or bored or whatever,
because trying to figure it out is gonna drive her crazy.
Come with me now.
He's on the way to C.C.U. All vitals are stable.
Dr. Yang for the win. Up top.
Dr. Yang, when did Dr. Russell's noninvasive tevar turn into
a bilateral thoracotomy with bypass?
When Russell's stent tore through the guy's aorta.
And you couldn't find the time to just...
consult with Russell first?
Yeah, I tried.
Russell doesn't even know you yet.
You don't have free reign
to just tear into someone else's patient.
You'll be gone on your first day.
He should thank me.
He's probably going to fire you.
Still, it was an amazing--
Shut up.
Hey, hey. Uh, you talk to your wife tonight?
No. Why?
Oh, I may have pushed a thing a little too far,
and now I'm not sure what you're going home to.
What did you do?
W-well...
Bailey, what-- what did you do?
Wh--
Oh, I may have pushed it just far enough.
Okay, you gotta go.
What?
She's like a, you know, a little bird.
If we move too fast, we'll scare her off.
You're too much pressure now. You gotta go.
Go, go, go. Go.
Okay.
Uh... yeah. Okay.
All right. Come here, little bird.
I never got the chart.
I am so sorry.
It's right here.
You know, you asked for my help, and I'm...I'm happy to help you,
but I can't do that unless I have the information.
Again, so sorry.
You know, when you say you're gonna do something,
you should... oh.
Right. Right here.
The pulmonary infiltrate.
I knew it. I think she has Lemierre's disease.
People still get lemierre's?
Well, I think she does.
You can confirm with an I.J. Ultrasound.
Now what's that gonna show?
Come on.
Lemierre's has markers...
the pneumonia, the complaint of shoulder pain.
And she might have an I.J. Thrombosis,
but we'll see if we caught that early enough.
But her throat cultures have been negative so far.
Yeah, it's tricky, and we see it so seldom now,
We overlook it.
You spoke to my mother.
Mm. I did.
So there won't be any more...
miscommunications?
Shouldn't be.
I'd appreciate it
if you could just keep it to yourselves.
Oh, well, we can certainly do that.
Thank you.
If you can.
Sorry?
Well, when I get an e-mail that's not meant for me,
I hit a quick reply or delete it.
You've been running back and forth,
making sure I hear from Catherine,
making sure she hears from me,
making sure we connect.
I think maybe you aren't as upset
as you pretend you are.
Oh, I'm not?
I think you're glad
your mother's found someone who makes her happy.
You just don't want to admit that.
Just keep it out of my inbox.
So tell me the name again.
Cyclic vomiting syndrome.
It's been linked to mitochondrial disease.
We see it a lot in kids...
Good labs, extreme nausea, vomiting for days.
It's a bitch to diagnose so the parents go crazy.
I thought it was the booze I was taking for the headaches.
No, it's the migraines.
That's what triggers the vomiting episodes.
But there's no cure?
Not yet, but now that we know what it is,
we can treat the migraines.
And I don't have to live like this anymore?
No, you don't.
Oh, this works on migraines
and should lessen your C.V.S. symptoms.
We're gonna set you up with a primary care doctor.
But if this happens again, you come back,
you, look for us...
Either, Dr. Wilson or myself.
We'll take good care of you.
Thank you.
Yeah. You sure saved my biscuits from the fire on this one,
Doc. Thanks.
Oh, thank her.
Someone else might have, let your biscuits burn.
Darlin',
I could hug you.
Oh, that's fine.
Except you're a little pukey there.
You know as well as I do, I had no other choice but to...
Let's wait and see what Russell says.
If you didn't want me here,
you shouldn't have hired me back.
Dr. Hunt, Dr. Yang, what happened?
I had to go in on your aortic ulcer.
He had hemoptysis...
Shh. Shh.
The patient is stable now.
We can talk about Dr. Yang's decision...
Dr. Yang...
Thank you.
Good save.
And thank you, Hunt. You're absolutely right.
Now I know why you pushed so hard for her.
Great work.
Could you take out your tape recorder?
I need to retract my earlier statement
or, testimony or whatever.
Well, I'm not sure anything you said w...
I lied before.
I do believe Dr. Shepherd can operate again.
Well, that's speculation, not fact.
It's a fact that nerve regeneration is very slow.
His nerve may need more time.
And there are also new nerve connectors we could try
for closer approximation of the severed ends.
That's a fact.
And we...we could still try an end-to-end transfer.
We haven't even tried to take a branch of the M.A.B.C.
You've given this some thought?
Yeah.
Every single night since you dropped that instrument.
Why didn't you mention any of this before?
Because I was scared.
Because I felt like I failed you.
But you weren't wrong to believe in me, Derek.
And you weren't wrong to push.
In fact, you should've pushed me harder.
We haven't tried everything.
You shouldn't give up until we do.
All right, listen--
I am sorry, okay?
I'm sure that you would prefer your booty calls
to be uncomplicated and void of feeling
so I think you should probably
just seek them somewhere else, okay?
'cause I know this is just sex to you.
And it's-- it's not just sex.
I mean, I wish it was. I pretend that it is,
'cause you have a good thing going with Jesus, but it's not.
It's not?
No, and stop calling me a car crash or dessert
or acting like I'm bumming out Jesus.
I'm sorry. You-- you made it seem like it was--
And stop acting like I don't have any feelings, okay?
I have feelings. I have a lot of 'em.
About what?
You. About you, April. For you.
I'm--I'm so sorry...
that I hurt them,
your--your feelings--
It's okay. Just--
I-I thought it was just sex.
Yeah, so did I.
Okay.
Have a good night.
Talk to you tomorrow.
I didn't stay to nail the freshmen.
I know. You stayed for Robbins.
Yeah, and you know what she told me?
That I'm a nobody. That I have no one.
She told me that I have nothing to show for my life.
I want your house, Mer, 'cause...
I don't know why. I just--I just do.
The chips on the ceiling are from
the first christmas tree we got intern year.
You wouldn't know that, because we didn't like you then.
And the burn marks on the hardwoods
are from flame shots from that stupid party Izzie threw.
And the scratch marks on the doorjamb in the study
are Zola's height marks since she could stand,
and the ones on the other side
are from me when I was little.
I grew up there, Alex.
It's hard for me to change things.
And you grew up there, too.
So before you go
trying to change everything about yourself,
you got yourself this far.
And you're fine the way you are, and so is the house.
So I'm not changing anything.
You can if you want, but I won't.
Okay.
We got a deal?
We got a deal.
What about the dry rot, though?
Would you get away from me with dry rot?
Thank you all for your cooperation today.
Next step is for us to file a complaint against the parties.
Can we leave the pilot out of this?
The man is a paraplegic now.
Yeah, I agree. We should take him off the list.
Wait. No. What if he was drunk
or--or asleep and--
No, we talked to him.
Dr. Hunt, I'm gonna have to ask you to step out now.
This is only appropriate for the victims of the crash.
Okay.
Folks, we're not going after the pilot.
We need to investigate him to make our case,
but the damages we'll be seeking will be far greater
than what that pilot could be accountable for.
Or the charter Company, for that matter.
We'll be going after bigger fish.
More and more, it's looking like the best strategy
will be to look for fault with the hospital itself.
Boise?
No, this hospital.
The people who put you on that plane.
All right. Well...
Uh, it looks fine.
It can be scary
to find out you've been wrong about something.
But we can't be afraid to change our minds...
You're right. You are absolutely right...
to accept that things are different...
That they'll never be the same...
Promise me you'll take this.
I will. Thank you.
for better...
or for worse.
We have to be willing to give up
what we used to believe.
God! You scared me.
What the hell are you doing here?
Mer gave me the keys.
Mer just sold me this place.
I know.
I want to rent from you.
No, no. I said no roommates.
Oh, come on. It's fine. It's a big house.
We work weird hours. We'll barely see each other.
You won't know I'm here.
The more we're willing to accept what is...
and not what we thought...
What?
You asking me for help.
Well, when you put it like that,
I want to kill myself.
The master's mine.
Rent's due on the first.
You buy the toilet paper.
