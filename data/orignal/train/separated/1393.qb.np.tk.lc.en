so how &apos;s the family ?
great . kids are getting so big . haley &apos;s about to go off ...
you can stop holding your stomach in .
to college .
you still exercising ?
clearly .
i look at a clint eastwood
or chuck norris and i think ,
there &apos;s no reason i can &apos;t stay tough like ..
oh , tickles !
but ...
that hurt ?
no . not r--ow .
what ?
it &apos;s probably nothing . you feeling okay ?
yeah .
maybe we &apos;ll just run a couple of tests , just to be safe .
what kind of tests ?
if there &apos;s anything wrong , i &apos;ll give you a call .
okay .
so how &apos;s the real estate market doing ?
well , interest rates are low , so it &apos;s a great time to be a buyer ,
but if you &apos;re a seller , you really have to ...
bend over ?
true , but a quality property is still a quality--
no , no , no . i need you to bend over .
oh . right .
well , let &apos;s dim the lights , crank up the norah jones ,
and get this over with .
oh , hey . how &apos;d it go ?
amazing . i was so proud of him .
oh , thanks , honey .
i &apos;m kind of proud of me , too .
look at what they gave me .
&quot; california state bar association award
&quot; for distinguished service in the field of environmental law . &quot;
you should have seen it . they called his name ,
he went up on stage , he gave a great speech .
it was humble , inspirational ,
with a touch of dry humor at the end .
it was very colin firth .
oh , cam , thank you ,
but ... it &apos;s hardly an oscar .
in the environmental law community ,
it kinda is an oscar .
so how was lily ? i hope you weren &apos;t too bored .
oh , please , are you kidding me ?
i love talking to her . she knows more words than haley .
oh , that looks great up there !
how impressed are you with your uncle right now ?
so impressed .
i didn &apos;t wanna ruin their moment
by telling them how many awards i &apos;ve gotten ,
but let &apos;s just say
i don &apos;t get out of bed for a trophy that size .
darn it !
i &apos;m trying to send an e @-@ mail .
this mouse keeps sticking .
pretty big reaction . it &apos;s 10 bucks , tops .
you just reminded me about my dream last night .
i was in the middle of a meadow , coming down a staircase ,
then suddenly a black mouse showed up .
he stopped , stared at me in the eyes ,
and opened his little mouth .
what did it say ?
what did he say , jay ?
he was a mouse . they don &apos;t know how to talk .
now you &apos;re playing logic police ?
you &apos;re standing on a staircase in a meadow ?
in my country , when somebody dreams about a black mouse ,
it means that something bad is going to happen !
ah , don &apos;t worry about it .
i dreamt about a lucky blue cow .
we &apos;re good to go .
hey , jay ,
this is what i &apos;m wearing for golfing tomorrow .
wanted to give you a heads up in case there &apos;s some overlap .
what are you going for here ?
matt damon in &quot; bagger vance . &quot; you didn &apos;t get that ?
i did . i think you look just like him .
it &apos;s the whole reason i asked you to teach me to golf .
any sport where you can wear this , i &apos;m in .
who is that ? it &apos;s 10 : 00 at night .
i &apos;ll get it .
hold on , gatsby .
hola ! it &apos;s javier ! open up !
dad !
there &apos;s my campeon !
there &apos;s your black mouse .
hola , javier , what are you doing in town ?
well , i missed manny &apos;s birthday , plus i have a free week .
you &apos;re staying a week ?
make that go away .
so , manny , tomorrow ,
in honor of you becoming a man ,
i am taking you to the racetrack
to enjoy the sport of kings , hmm ?
that &apos;s so cool !
actually , manny and i have plans to play golf tomorrow .
golfing ? pfft ! that is for old men
and for women who like women .
come on . your dad is in town . let &apos;s go to the races .
yeah , can we all go ?
ay , no , baby , i can &apos;t .
i promised haley that i was gonna help her with her spanish .
but jay &apos;s going to go with you .
what ?
i &apos;m not gonna let manny take off with javier by himself .
once , when manny was 6,
javier took him to the petting zoo ,
which later , i found out
that was the name of the stripper club .
a real petting zoo would have been cleaner .
but i was looking forward to playing--
you &apos;re going .
that i don &apos;t miss .
第三季 第十一集
would you look at that ?
oh , yeah , you know ,
i never saw us as trophy on the mantle people ,
but yours looked so gosh darned good up there ,
i figured , why not be proud of what we &apos;ve done ?
uh , &quot; first place , basscatcrsrs spring fish @-@ off ,
missouri north division . &quot;
2 @-@ day total of 10 smallmouth bass
weighing 34.24 pounds
with a 4.1 / 2 @-@ pound kicker .
so you beat all the other boys aged 12 through 17 ?
sure did .
look at our trophies up there .
we &apos;re a couple of winners , aren &apos;t we ?
are we ?
claire ?
where are all my razor blades ?
they &apos;re not in that box ?
no .
well , i guess they &apos;re gone .
they can &apos;t be gone .
in my 20s , i went on a game show
and won a lifetime supply of razor blades .
okay , phil , time is up . what is your answer ?
3.14159 .
oh ! i &apos;m sorry , phil .
the correct answer is banana cream .
banana cream .
banana cream . well , you got me there , chip .
but you &apos;re not leaving empty @-@ handed , no .
you &apos;re going home with a lifetime supply
of genesis twin @-@ blade razors .
what ? ! two blades in one razor ?
man , it &apos;ll ever get be better than that !
you must have used them all up .
they said &quot; lifetime supply . &quot;
honey , you got 15 years of free razor blades .
put that in the &quot; win &quot; column and move on .
mom , is it okay if my friend walt comes over
to play &quot; rebel fighters 3 &quot; ?
honey , don &apos;t you think it is a little weird
that one of your best friends is an eighty @-@ year @-@ old man ?
no , it makes it more fun , because he was in a real war .
he says cool things like
&quot; see you in hell , klaus . &quot;
i don &apos;t even know what that means .
oh , hey , dad , some doctor called for you .
dr. sendroff ?
yeah , that &apos;s it . you &apos;re in the shower .
what did he say ?
he wants you to call him right away .
oh , well . see you in hell , klaus .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i don &apos;t know .
he ran a few tests on me yesterday .
he said he &apos;ll call if something was wrong .
and now he &apos;s calling .
hi , this is phil dunphy .
i &apos;m returning dr. sendroff &apos;s call
are you serious ?
what ?
he &apos;s on a flight to london .
um , is there any way i can reach him ,
or--uh , uh , someone else i can talk to ?
okay . fine .
please just tell him it &apos;s urgent .
thank you .
oh , boy .
honey , i am sure it &apos;s nothing .
claire , i &apos;m tender under my arm .
maybe luke hit you with his broomstick
when you guys play quidditch .
i &apos;m way too fast he never touched me .
i can assure you you are perfectly fine .
that &apos;s very comforting ,
coming from a marketing major at a party school .
i like the number 4 horse .
he loves this track ,
his dad won the preakness ,
last three finishes were in the money .
i like miranda &apos;s miracle .
why ?
there &apos;s this girl miranda in my class ,
and she is really pretty .
if she likes me back , it will be a miracle .
would you bet $ 2 on that one for me , jay ?
sure , but you are throwing your money away .
you both are .
the winner of the race will be number 7--
my hometown .
number 7 ...
well , he &apos;s carrying 3 extra pounds ,
and he hates the distance .
those are just words on a page .
i look the horse in the eye ,
and he tells me ... he is the winner .
tells ya ?
perhaps this will sound crazy .
no need for the qualifier .
but i have always been able to see into the soul of a horse .
it is a gift , and i do not question it .
just like i always end up on the shortest line at the bank .
maybe i should bet on your horse .
are you kidding me ? these aren &apos;t just words .
they give you all this information ,
so you can make an informed decision
and beat the odds .
yes , of course ,
and this is why everybody with a racing form is rich .
now come on . it &apos;s time to place our bets .
what &apos;s it gonna be , manny ?
$ 2 on my hometown .
you really think he &apos;s going to win ?
well , i only know what he tells me with his eyes .
don &apos;t ask me why , but maybe in some previous life , i was a horse .
or part of a horse .
oh , hey , alex called .
she left her cell phone here .
she &apos;s gonna come back and get it .
cam , did you do something to your fish trophy ?
oh , yeah , i forgot about this fun middle part .
you see , now it looks like a fish jumping out of the water .
yeah , right over mine .
do i sense something , mitch ?
you know , just because mine &apos;s a little taller than yours ,
doesn &apos;t make yours any less important .
oh , no . that &apos;s not what i was feeling ,
not even a little bit .
oh , my god . you don &apos;t like that i put my trophy up .
i just think it &apos;s a little weird
that immediately after i win a trophy ,
you feel the need to dig this thing up
and plop it down next to mine .
i &apos;ll have you know
that i want to display this for quite some time .
but i put it in box in the garage
with all my other awards--
yes , award @-@ z--
out of courtesy to a sadly award @-@ less you .
it looks ridiculous .
mine is a distinguished professional award
given to me by my peers ,
and yours was given to you on a pier .
okay , well , for your information ,
when i won this , it was a very big deal .
i cut a ribbon at the grocery store and signed autographs .
&quot; best fishes , cameron tucker &quot;
oh , you know what ? i just remembered !
mine comes with a really fun pedestal , too !
oh ! look at that !
oh , and proper hierarchy is restored . mm @-@ hmm .
unless you suddenly remember
that your fish came with a top hat .
okay. you know what ?
i &apos;m gonna go get lily from her party and go to the park .
ok .
this award has changed you , mitchell .
you may be flying high now ,
but pretty soon , you &apos;re gonna be free falling , tom petty ...
&#91; petty 姓氏派迪 意译为心胸狭隘 小气鬼 &#93;
because you &apos;re petty .
tom petty .
hmm ? get it ?
about three sentences ago .
hola , haley .
hi , gloria . thanks for coming over .
en espanol , por favor .
uh , hola , gloria .
gracias for coming over .
no , the whole thing .
i don &apos;t know the whole thing .
why do i even need to learn spanish ?
i live in california . i &apos;m never gonna use it .
that &apos;s the problem with americans .
they expect all of us to know their language ,
but they don &apos;t even make the effort to learn ours .
win a war sometime .
then we &apos;ll start talking like you .
ha . so wrong .
oh , hey , gloria .
hi , phil . how are you ?
i wish i knew .
why ? what &apos;s wrong ?
uh , i don &apos;t wanna bum you out .
my doctor did some tests
and said he &apos;d call if something was wrong ,
and he called this morning .
and what did he say ?
i don &apos;t know . i missed the call .
now i can &apos;t reach him .
the black mouse .
what ?
in my dream .
it was a bad omen .
but probably not for you .
the staircase .
no , no , no . you &apos;re fine . you &apos;re fine .
am i ? get this --
15 years ago , i won a lifetime supply of razor blades .
they ran out ...
today .
what &apos;s with the spitting ? are you warding off death ?
no . when i did
i think i suck in a little bug .
$ 16 for the first race , $ 10 from the second race ,
plus $ 34-- $ 60 ?
you &apos;re a genius , dad .
well , i cannot take all the credit .
it is a particularly chatty group of horses today .
i love gambling ! it &apos;s so easy !
it &apos;s not easy .
well , not for you . you &apos;ve lost , what , three in a row ?
oh , burn , jay !
i &apos;m sorry . that was uncalled for .
this is all so heady .
$ 50 on little bacon to win .
ooh @-@ ee .
yeah , ooh @-@ ee .
what ? what ooh @-@ ee ?
there is something not right about that horse .
i think i saw it , too .
you didn &apos;t see anything .
this horse is a heavy favorite .
the rest of the pack couldn &apos;t beat a merry @-@ go @-@ round .
i &apos;m sticking with little bacon .
it &apos;s your funeral .
who are we going with , dad ?
nobody in this race , papito .
it was quiet down there in the paddock just now--
too quiet .
oh , gee . you know what ? make it $ 300 .
oh , my .
i &apos;m telling you , kid , this is the one .
and you know how i know ?
&apos;cause it said , &quot; pfft . &quot;
they don &apos;t talk like that .
&quot; maria bought a beautiful white dress for her wedding . &quot;
um , maria compro
un hermoso vestido blanco
para su-- i @-@ i &apos;m sorry .
i cannot concentrate with him here .
what are you doing ?
just taking it all in .
you &apos;re a beautiful , intelligent woman ...
and don &apos;t you ever forget it .
wow , he is so weird sometimes .
no , he &apos;s not weird ! he &apos;s a saint !
and you will miss him when he &apos;s gone ...
one day .
hey , uncle mitchell .
your , uh , phone &apos;s on the table .
what &apos;s that ?
oh , cam &apos;s old fishing trophy .
yeah , when i woke up this morning ,
that &apos;s where i found it .
right after you got yours ?
thank you !
oh , my god . welcome to my world .
last week , i got this beautiful plaque
from the debate team for outstanding achievement ,
and what did my mom do ?
she found one of luke &apos;s &quot; participant &quot; ribbons
and a certificate haley got for showing up somewhere on time ,
and put all three of them together on the same shelf !
it &apos;s , like , so unfair !
i was so glad i talked to alex ,
because she agreed with every single thing i was feeling--
which made me realize
that i was acting like a 14 @-@ year @-@ old girl .
ah , come on , kid .
i just lost an arm &apos; cause of you .
now get your head in the game .
sorry . i can &apos;t concentrate with my dad staring at me .
i just love you so much .
i hope he &apos;s talking to you .
ugh . oh , great , now i &apos;m dead .
i &apos;m going to the bathroom .
you know , they say that happens .
hey , walt .
you ever think about death ?
i &apos;m 85 . death is my roommate .
i got a call from the doctor .
there &apos;s a 60 % chance i &apos;m gonna die .
ha ! doctors--
said i &apos;d be dead ten years ago .
look at me .
i &apos;m healthy as a--
i gotta go change my tank .
phil , you &apos;ve gotta let this go .
i &apos;m sorry , claire .
i don &apos;t know how to react
when i find out there &apos;s a 70 % chance i &apos;m gonna die .
honey , listen to me .
you &apos;re gonna be fine .
you really think so ?
i know so .
claire &apos;s my rock .
you know when you &apos;re on a plane and there &apos;s turbulence ,
you look at the flight attendants ,
and if they &apos;re still smiling and serving drinks ,
you know everything &apos;s gonna be okay ?
that &apos;s claire .
i could also picture her as a cop .
and into the final furlong it &apos;s little bacon
followed by bradswaxjacket
go little bacon . go little bacon .
you got this ! you got this !
go ! go ! go ! go ! go !
and the winner is no.9 little bacon by 3 lengths .
yes ! i knew it !
you see that , manny ? dumb luck always runs out .
but if you live in the real world ,
and you use your head ,
not have it in the clouds like dr. dolittle there ,
you &apos;ll do okay .
guess we should have listened to jay on this one , dad .
you got that right . you should have listened to jay .
and i &apos;ll tell you something else .
you can &apos;t look in a horse &apos;s eyes
and tell there &apos;s something wrong .
you can &apos;t even look in their eyes at the same time --
one &apos;s here and one &apos;s here !
come on . let &apos;s go to the window , kid .
i may need some help carrying my winnings .
oh . wait .
jay , look .
inquiry .
what &apos;s that ?
it is when a horse has committed an infraction .
possible infraction . usually it &apos;s nothing .
i &apos;m sure ...
the number 9 horse little bacon
has been disqualified for interference .
what ? !
the winner is number 6 bradswaxjacket .
you see ?
the eyes ...
they do not lie .
tough break , jay .
here ...
little something for gas .
cam was right . i @-@ i was being petty .
so i found his box of old trophies
and i decided to surprise him
by having them on the mantle when he got home .
well , i was the one who was surprised .
i had no idea how many trophies he had--
first place , and all of them for different things .
music , football , art show , science fair ,
a chili cook @-@ off .
a lifetime of accolades hidden away
just so i wouldn &apos;t feel bad .
aah ! that &apos;s a mouse ! that &apos;s a mou--oh ! ew !
oh ! disgusting !
oh , no ! no , cam , i @-@ i was gonna make a big display !
i believe you have .
no , no , cam ! there was a--
oh ! gross !
listen , manny , do me a favor
and get me a cappuccino from right over there , okay ?
no , it &apos;s okay . i got it .
so ...
you wanna talk about what happened back there ?
not at all .
you know ...
it is not just the horses whose souls i can read through their eyes .
you really wanna know ? i &apos;ll tell you .
okay . i &apos;ll leave you alone .
all right , listen , hang on .
i &apos;m sorry i went after you like that in front of manny .
that was wrong .
no , i get it . nobody likes to lose at the races .
i don &apos;t owe this guy anything .
he stops by a couple of times a year to see his kid .
it used to be a relief , gave me a nice break .
but now manny and i , we got our own thing .
look , i know i &apos;m not his dad ...
maybe i don &apos;t like the reminder .
oh ! oh , my gosh !
hey , what &apos;s up ?
what ?
we came as soon as we heard .
heard what ?
we heard phil got bad news from the doctor .
who told you that ?
gloria !
no , i didn &apos;t say that he got bad news ...
i said that he was getting bad news .
you don &apos;t know that he &apos;s getting bad news .
i saw a black mouse .
i saw a black mouse .
so he says .
okay . you guys ...
oh , this is worse than i thought !
no , it &apos;s not . listen to me . listen .
phil is fine . as a matter of fact ,
you should go before he even knows you &apos;re here .
no , no . we &apos;re staying . we &apos;re staying .
we got here as soon as we could .
did you bring the coffee cake ?
yes , i have it right here .
he carried it in from the car . i paid for it .
listen . listen to me .
i am very sorry for what you are going through .
thank you .
who is this ?
who , indeed ?
i am javier delgado , manny &apos;s father
and gloria &apos;s former husband and lover .
i hope you do not think this is insensitive ,
but you are a beautiful woman ,
and you will have no trouble to find a man-- ...
javier ! the body is not even cold yet !
the body is upstairs watching basketball .
he is fine .
gloria said he was sick .
no .
he went to the doctor , he had some tests .
the doctor called . that &apos;s it .
plus today he run out of his lifetime supply of razors .
that &apos;s a sign .
this is a lot of hocus @-@ pocus !
i can &apos;t believe i bought a coffee cake over this !
wait , wait , wait , no , no . i &apos;m confused .
what did the doctor say exactly ?
i don &apos;t know . we missed his call this morning .
the doctor called on saturday ?
yeah . so ?
nothing .
not nothing . not nothing . what ?
well , it &apos;s just that , uh ,
doctors don &apos;t usually call on saturday with good news
but they could call--
i mean , he could call with anything .
do you think he &apos;s sick ...
what &apos;s ... what going on ?
nothing . nothing . everybody just came by
for absolutely no reason at all .
you look worried .
i &apos;m not worried .
oh , god . the plane &apos;s in trouble .
you put away the drink cart and you &apos;re strapping in .
you &apos;re gonna be fine , kid !
you are gonna be great !
i wish i looked this good .
stop , please ! you &apos;re freaking me out .
are you gonna die ?
i don &apos;t know ! there &apos;s stil a 5 % chance i &apos;ll make it !
it &apos;s dr. sendroff .
okay . okay .
guys , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s on
the other end of this phone call ...
but whatever happens , i just want you to know ,
you &apos;ve already given me a lifetime supply of happiness .
i remember once as a child--
answer it !
do it !
dr. sendroff ?
what &apos;s the word ?
are you serious ?
what ?
that &apos;s it ?
what is it ? !
h @-@ hold on one second .
he &apos;s calling about a real estate listing . i &apos;m fine .
ay , no .
yesterday , you said you &apos;d call if something was wrong .
then you called , then you disappeared .
that is the most irresponsible , unprofessional thing
i &apos;ve ever heard of in my entire life !
and do you have anyone to represent you
in the sale of your current house ?
look into his eyes .
i don &apos;t care what the doctor says .
i give him six months .
stop staring .
so , phil ddunphy , tell us a little bit about yourself .
well , chip , i &apos;m married to a great lady--hi , claire !
and i have a baby girl .
um , i &apos;m a real estate agent , and i enjoy playing checkers .
okay .
both chinese and american .
and , uh , i am a fan of hip @-@ hop .
well , good for you .
though i try to stay neutral in the whole east coast / west coast thang .
next up we have a--
one quick thing--
shout out to my , uh , college buddy ling ,
who built his own helicopter and is taking his first flight today ,
and , uh , i also wanna wish a happy anniversary
to my in @-@ laws jay and dede pritchett .
your eternal love is an inspiration to us all .
okay . that &apos;s enough .
next up , we have a homemaker from west mifflin , pennsylvania .
