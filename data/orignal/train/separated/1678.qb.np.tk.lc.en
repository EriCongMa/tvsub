whatcha doin &apos; there ?
working on a new plan to catch the roadrunner ?
the humorous implication being that i am wile e. coyote ?
yes .
and this is a schematic for a bird @-@ trapping device
that will ultimately backfire and cause me physical injury ?
yes .
what i &apos;m doing here
is trying to determine when i &apos;m going to die .
a lot of people are working on that research .
so what is all this ?
my family history factoring in longevity
propensity for disease et cetera .
interesting .
cause of death for uncle carl was kbb .
what &apos;s &quot; kbb &quot; ?
&quot; killed by badger . &quot;
how &apos;s that ?
it was thanksgiving .
uncle carl said &quot; i think there &apos;s a badger living in our chimney . &quot;
&quot; hand me that flashlight . &quot;
those were the last words he ever spoke to us .
i don &apos;t think you need
to worry about death by badgers being hereditary .
not true .
the fight or flight instinct is coded genetically .
instead of fleeing he chose to fight barehanded
against a brawny member of the weasel family .
who &apos;s to say that i don &apos;t share that flawed dna ?
you can always get a badger and find out .
but seriously
even if i disregard the uncle carl factor
at best i have 60 years left .
that long huh ?
60 only takes me to here .
i need to get to here .
what &apos;s there ?
the earliest estimate of the singularity
when man will be able to transfer his consciousness
into machines and achieve immortality .
so you &apos;re upset about missing out
on becoming some sort of freakish self @-@ aware robot ?
by this much .
tough break . you want eggs ?
you don &apos;t get it leonard .
i &apos;m going to miss so much .
the unified field theory cold fusion the dogapus .
what &apos;s a dogapus ?
the hybrid dog and octopus .
man &apos;s underwater best friend .
is somebody working on that ?
i was going to .
i planned on giving it to myself on my 300th birthday .
wait a minute . you hate dogs .
a dogapus can play fetch with eight balls .
no one can hate that .
what do we owe you ?
it came to $ 28.17 .
let &apos;s say six bucks apiece .
here you go .
thank you .
what ?
never mind . i got it .
oh you wanted me to pay .
it &apos;s no big deal .
no no no no . you &apos;re right .
we &apos;re not going out anymore ; i should pay for myself .
what ?
he said &quot; if he had woman parts
&quot; he &apos;d eat for free the rest of his life &quot;
yeah but you wouldn &apos;t be able to talk to yourself .
i &apos;m a little low on cash .
how much you got ?
nothing .
how can you walk around with no money ?
i &apos;m cute . i get by .
it &apos;s okay you can owe me .
thank you .
sheldon six bucks .
no thank you . i &apos;m not eating pizza tonight .
but it &apos;s thursday .
thursday &apos;s pizza night .
not for me .
thursday is now cruciferous vegetable night .
tonight &apos;s selection : brussels sprouts .
really ?
you &apos;re changing the sheldonian calendar ?
it &apos;s a small price to pay .
for what ?
no no don &apos;t ask .
sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry .
in order to live long enough to fuse my consciousness
with cybernetics i need to change my diet .
wait . cybernetics is robot stuff right ?
correct .
so you want to turn yourself into some sort of robot ?
essentially yes .
okay here &apos;s my question .
didn &apos;t you already do that ?
flattering but sadly no .
i &apos;m also planning to begin an exercise regimen
designed to strengthen my cardiovascular system .
aka jogging .
wait . honey have you ever run before ?
certainly .
i &apos;ve run from bullies dogs angry chickens ...
and one particularly persistent p.e. teacher
determined to bend me over and give me a scoliosis test .
you &apos;re right . penny jogs .
maybe you guys can run together .
that &apos;s an excellent idea .
yeah if we chat
it will create the illusion of time going faster .
no it won &apos;t .
um how does he know i jog ?
oh he watches you from his car with high @-@ powered binoculars .
oh my god that is so creepy !
i know !
and he says he &apos;s not gonna stop .
then see a shrink and figure out how to talk to women .
what the hell ?
what &apos;s the matter ?
i have pain radiating from my navel
to my lower right abdomen .
i &apos;m nauseated and feverish .
i believe i may have cholera .
there &apos;s no cholera in pasadena .
just like last summer when there was no malaria in pasadena .
well if it &apos;s not cholera
then based on a quick internet search
the other explanations in decreasing order of likelihood
are hirschsprung &apos;s disease botulism a 30 @-@ foot tapeworm
or accidental ingestion of chrysanthemum blossoms .
when would you have accidentally eaten chrysanthemum blossoms ?
it &apos;s part of an unlikely scenario
that involves sleepwalking and a 24 @-@ hour flower mart
with a less @-@ than- vigilant proprietor .
oh lord my belly !
ever had your appendix out ?
i haven &apos;t .
i &apos;ve been meaning to but who has the time ?
let &apos;s get you to the hospital .
so this is how it ends ...
with cruel irony .
just as i make the commitment to preserving my body
i am betrayed by my appendix a vestigial organ .
do you know the original purpose of the appendix leonard ?
no .
i do . and yet i &apos;m doomed while you live on .
funny how things work out isn &apos;t it ?
oh lord i think it &apos;s about to burst !
on the other hand
it might have been the brussels sprouts .
good night .
good night .
appendicitis .
what a nervous nelly .
penny ! penny ! penny !
coming coming .
hey nice knees .
thank you .
they &apos;re my mother &apos;s .
oh . and the flash shirt is what ?
because what you &apos;re gonna run really fast ?
no the flash shirt is because it &apos;s friday
but it &apos;s nice when things work out .
where &apos;s your heart rate monitor ?
i don &apos;t have one .
what about your pedometer ?
don &apos;t have one .
do you have telematics in your shoes connected to an ipod ?
uh no .
what do you do
you just go out there and gambol about like a bunny ?
no . i just run till i &apos;m hungry then i stop for a bear claw .
why are you doing that ?
it &apos;s good to stretch your muscles before you run .
all right .
let &apos;s start with a toe touch .
okay you do it .
i &lt; i &gt; am &lt; / i &gt; doing it .
oh . wow . good job .
can you do this ?
we &apos;ll never know .
okay let &apos;s just warm up on the run .
okay .
okay let &apos;s go .
i &apos;ve been reading up on biomechanics .
i think you &apos;ll be surprised at my ...
oh my god are you okay ?
i think so .
oh let me help you up .
thank you .

he &apos;s just expressing his admiration that
you don &apos;t even have to put out to get free stuff .
it &apos;s not free-- i &apos;m gonna pay him back .
shut up !
sheldon are you gonna join us ?
coming !
greetings friends .
greetings whatever the hell you are .
i am a mobile virtual presence device .
recent events
have demonstrated to me that my body is too fragile
to endure the vicissitudes of the world .
until such time as i am able
to transfer my consciousness
i shall remain in a secure location
and interact with the world in this manner .
really ? that &apos;s your question--
when did he put a ramp in ?
you &apos;re in my spot .
this may seem a little odd at first
but over time you &apos;ll grow accustomed
to dealing with me in this configuration .
yeah to be honest i don &apos;t see much difference .
thank you .
that &apos;s what i was going for .
now leonard tomorrow when we go to work
you &apos;ll need to allow some extra time
to get me down the stairs .
for your convenience i disassemble into four pieces .
this is ridiculous .
i &apos;m coming to talk to you .
you don &apos;t know where i am .
my physical body is safely ensconced
in a secure undisclosed location .
you &apos;re in your bedroom .
no i &apos;m not .
i can hear your voice coming from your bedroom .
no you can &apos;t .
wait .
come back .
halt .
authorized personnel only !
so either one of you weirdos
want to buy my underwear ? only 1.400 bucks .
sheldon this is ridiculous .
i &apos;m behind you .
please look at me when you &apos;re talking to me .
i am looking at you .
no you &apos;re not .
pay no attention to that man in the bed .
you cannot exist as a virtual presence .
not here and certainly not at work .
oh good god .
at my age do you know
how i &apos;m statistically most likely to die ?
at the hands of your roommate ?
an accident .
that &apos;s how i &apos;m going to make it look .
until i can transfer my intellect
to a more durable container
my body will remain safely ensconced in my bed .
fine but don &apos;t expect my help .
you have to help-- it &apos;s in the roommate agreement .
no it &apos;s not .
section 74.c.
the various obligations and duties of the parties
in the event one of them becomes a robot .
i &apos;ll be damned .
this is delightful .
uh @-@ huh .
it &apos;s much easier to enjoy
the picturesque route we travel to work
when you remove the specter of fiery vehicular death .
refresh my memory .
why didn &apos;t i just put you in the trunk ?
because i called shotgun . remember ?
right .
you seem tense .
perhaps this will relax you .
i don &apos;t want to listen to music sheldon .
very well .
i don &apos;t understand why you &apos;re not enjoying this .
together in this car with my enhanced capabilities
we &apos;re like knight rider .
except in knight rider the car isn &apos;t a yammering sphincter .
you mock the sphincter
but the sphincter is a class of muscle
without which human beings couldn &apos;t survive .
there are over 50 different sphincters
in the human body .
how many can you name ?
i was wrong-- this is exactly like knight rider .
perhaps you &apos;d be interested in a different game .
no .
this is a photograph of the 1911
solvay conference on the theory of radiation and quanta .

and sell him to some jawas .

sheldon i &apos;m not waiting on you .

i care neither for turtlenecks nor showmanship .
yeah i never got that turtleneck thing .
one of my proudest possessions is a vintage 1977 apple two .

it was a pretty nifty little achievement .
thanks we were shooting for &quot; nifty . &quot;
