If she hadn't given you back that ring,
You'd be married to her right now.
Possibly.
Put your arm around me.
Nice work.
It was easy.
Well, I'm not.
I'll be back for it on Monday.
As soon as the banks open, I'll have the cash.
Here you go.
Is this some kind of a joke?
I-I brought in a ring.
Not according to the ticket.
Somebody broke into our garage?
Did they get into the house? Is anything else missing?
Looking for someone?
No. I thought that you were the only one living here.
I am.
Melissa
Is this a suicide note or a confession?
It's both.
Emily... How do you have this?
I sent it to her.
I took a picture with my phone before we called the cops.
It's weird-- why would Ian kill himself
just as he was about to skip town with Melissa?
Maybe he realized he was gonna get caught.
He couldn't hide forever,
even with Melissa and Wren's help.
He was probably desperate.
Look, who cares why Ian did it?
The important thing is, Ali's killer is dead
and we're no longer people of interest.
Why am I not feeling relieved right now?
Oh, Em, come on.
For months, we've been about as welcome
in this town as a cold sore,
and plus, now people know that we've been telling the truth.
And Ian is out of our lives for good.
Yeah... But "A" isn't.
Can we please just slay one dragon at a time?
What are you doing here?
I just came to return
some evidence we took from the field hockey office.
Hey, um, look, I just wanted to say
that I'm sorry you all had to be the ones who found him.
Melissa's the one who found him.
I'm sorry. Then again, could have been worse.
What do you mean?
Bodies decay. He'd been dead at least a week.
Give my best to your family.
Yeah.
A week?!
No, that's impossible. He was texting Melissa.
No, he wasn't. I'm betting it was "A."
Why would "A" pretend to be Ian
and then lead us there to his body?
Does it matter?
The guy was scum, and now he's dead scum.
Who cares if "A" found him first?
What does "A" Want?
You know what I want?
I want to enjoy my life again...
before "A" finds another way to ruin it.
Are you coming?
No, you guys go ahead.
Em, what is it?
We now know "A" is involved.
Doesn't that make you nervous?
Yeah...
But not as much as Ian did.
Could we just please take a break from looking over our shoulder?
遗书是不是看起来很眼熟 -A
Well, thanks for calling, Jess.
I really appreciate it.
Oh, we're hanging in there.
yeah. Okay, I will. Bye.
Are you gonna answer that?
Reporters have been calling all day.
Listen, you bottom- feeding vultures,
stop sucking the life out of my family.
Oh, I'm so sorry, grandma.
Let-- let me give her to you.
Hi, ma.
Yeah, I know. It's crazy here.
Let me call you back, okay?
Did you reach somebody?
It wasn't easy.
Finally got ahold of his aunt.
She wants nothing to do with us.
Meaning what, exactly?
Meaning she doesn't want to give him a funeral.
So what now?
We're responsible for burying him?
Let's just-- let's talk about this later.
No, no, Veronica. We can't put this off.
What options do we have?
We can turn him over to the county!
I-I think... We need to give him a funeral.
It's the right thing to do.
Sweetie, no one expects us to give him a funeral.
We'll regret it if we don't.
Please.
I think she needs this.
Let us think about it, okay?
Do you want ice?
Sure.
Uh... We don't have any? Are you hungry?
Do you have any food?
No.
That's... on the list too,
after ice.
My mom's been too busy to shop.
So, why are you here, anyway?
Well, I heard what happened, and I just...
wanted to see how you were holding up.
You don't have to check in on me anymore, okay?
One fake date does not a relationship make.
Wait. I'm sorry.
It's just...
It's been a stressful couple of days.
Have you ever seen one?
A dead body, I mean.
Yeah.
Hanna?
Yeah, I'm in here.
Why didn't you answer your phone?
It's off. I'm charging it.
I left messages.
'Bout what?
That's not the point.
When I call, I need to be able
to reach you, always.
Okay.
Mom, what's wrong?
Did something happen with dad?
Is it work?
This whole... past year...
Whenever you have left the house,
there's a part of me that's been terrified
that you might never come back.
Every time you walk out that door,
I memorize the color of your top,
whether you're wearing jeans or a skirt,
what kind of shoes you have on,
just in case I ever have to--
No, mom, don't.
Don't go there.
We don't have to worry about this anymore.
It's over.
We can breathe again.
Yeah.
I never understood what people meant
when they said they had an out-of-body experience,
but after I heard Melissa scream...
It was like everything was in slow motion.
Look, it's... going to take a long time
for that night to go away.
I think the hardest part is...
Hey, "Z," I wanted...
Sorry. I didn't realize.
Hey, Jackie, this is Aria,
a former student of mine.
I think we've met, actually.
Aren't you professor Montgomery's daughter?
Yeah, um, we met at my parents' place, I think.
I-I was just on the way to my dad's office
when I ran into... Mr. Fitz.
She's not your student anymore.
I think you can let the girl call you by your first name.
I just stopped by 'cause
the psych department moved their conference to Friday.
We don't have to take over your lecture hall after all.
Cool.
Nice seeing you again, Aria.
Mmm, you too!
"Z"?
All my college friends call me that.
Yeah, well, from ages 2 to 7,
my family used to call me "pookie bear,"
but... all good things must come to an end.
Aria.
I'm sorry. It's just...
frustrating, you know?
The whole point of you working here was so that
you wouldn't have to introduce me as your former student.
You didn't have to offer up that stuff about your dad.
You basically demoted me to a pit stop.
Okay, whatever.
Clearly, we both need to find some way
to warm people up to the idea of us as a couple.
How about I start introducing you as pookie bear?
Mmm! No.
How 'bout you just start introducing me as a friend?
okay.
Sounds like a plan.
Hey. Someone tried to deliver a package to my house.
It's probably for my mom, but she's out of town.
I was wondering if I could sign for it.
Do you have any I.D.?
Sure.
Do I know you?
Uh, no, I-I don't think so.
Did you go to Rosewood High?
Uh, n-no.
Um... Excuse me. I've got to make a delivery.
Look, somebody paid me to drop off this bag
and pick up a package.
He found me online. My name is Logan Reed.
I made you some tea.
Oh, thanks.
Wren called,
to see how you and Melissa were.
That was nice of him.
It's a good thing your father didn't answer. He would have hung up.
He's not as forgiving as I am.
I thought your teachers
gave you extensions on all of your homework.
Oh, they did. But...
Exams are still next week.
You work so hard.
You always have.
We made the arrangements for the funeral.
There will be no frills,
no flowers, and as far as I'm concerned, no tears.
Your father and I were very moved
by your desire to do this for your sister.
I just think she needs some kind of ceremony.
You were right.
We did need to do this.
I called the girls to see
if they would come to the funeral to support you.
It's the least I can do.
I'm the one that separated you.
Mom, it's okay.
No, it's not.
It's not okay that I didn't believe you,
and it's not okay that I...
that I allowed a monster in my house.
But I promise I will never do it again.
Will you give me another chance?
Of course.
I love you so much, honey.
Mike.
What were you thinking?
Hey! Mike!
He broke into your house?
Never got in, actually. Caught him at the window.
The house was dark.
I'm guessing he thought no one was home.
I'm really sorry.
He's-- he's never done anything like this before.
Thank you for not calling the police.
Don't worry about it.
I really don't know what to tell you.
Look, if...
If I tell my parents, they are gonna flip out.
But if I don't, then he's--
No, don't. He knows he's been busted.
Why-- why didn't you? Call the police?
I've seen enough cops in my house for one year.
Right.
Anyway... Thanks.
Thanks again.
Bye.
Look, I'm-- I'm really sorry
that you got caught in a full-on chick flick yesterday.
No worries.
My mom usually try and save eat, pray, love moments
for when we're alone.
Hey, don't apologize, okay? You're lucky.
The only thing my foster mom cares about
is cashing the checks.
I thought you were living at Lucas's.
I am.
Then why is your foster mom still getting money for you?
I mean, you don't even live with her.
That's the deal.
As long as I show up for that visit
from child services, Janet leaves me alone.
No, Caleb, why do you have to settle for that?
I'm sure there are so many other amazing people--
Yeah, I'm sure that there are,
but I could end up with a lot worse.
It's a short jump from eat, pray, love
to drink, snap, slap.
Ian didn't commit suicide.
That entire suicide letter is made up of "A" texts.
What?
How do you know that?
When I read it again,
a couple of words stuck out to me.
On a hunch, I checked my old text messages.
Come here.
"I killed Alison.
I lost my temper because she knew too much.
There's only so much you can bury.
It won't be that easy,
but I know how to get rid of the pain.
I can't run from the law.
Come and find me. Ian."
So these are the parts from the texts.
There are only five people that know about these texts--
Us and "A."
It means that "A" wrote that suicide note.
How did you figure this out?
Please. I've been watching
Wheel of Fortune with my mom since I was 3.
If "A" wrote this, that means that Ian
never actually confessed
to killing Ali in writing.
It gets worse.
Logan Reed, the guy who dropped off the money for Ian
the night of the sting?
Well, I know where he works.
We need more answers.
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Look, I don't know anything, okay?
Would you chill?
I'm not trying to get you in trouble.
I just want to ask you a few questions.
I saw a posting online.
Someone was offering cash to make a same-day delivery,
so I-I answered it.
So Ian paid you in cash.
Who? What guy who killed himself?
No, I-I never even met him.
I never even spoke to him. A woman hired me.
What woman? What did she look like?
I never met her either.
When I spoke to her on the phone,
she told me where to go and what to say.
So, how did she pay you?
We used a P.O. Box.
Can you describe her voice
or tell me how old you think this woman was?
I don't know. I don't know how to describe voices,
but I think I'd recognize it if I heard it again.
Thanks so much for your concern.
I will be sure to have all these forms back to you by tomorrow.
What happened to giving me a head's up?
Do you know how stupid it makes me look
when I can't answer questions about you?
Here's a crib sheet. I like kung-fu flicks,
my favorite color is blue,
and I once went four days without a meal.
Cute. Don't let it happen again.
It is a serious pain in the ass
for me to come all the way down here just to drop these off.
Mike, why are you avoiding me?
I'm not avoiding you.
Every time I try to talk to you, you run the other way.
It was stupid. I was bored, okay?
Okay, let me get this straight.
You decide to commit a felony
because they take wrestling off Tuesday nights?
Sure. Let's go with that.
Oh, Mike, come on, I'm trying to help you.
Why did you break into the house?
What were you looking for?
I didn't take anything, okay?
If it's such a big deal,
I'll put Emily's junky camping gear back.
Let's just drop it.
Wait.
You were the one that broke into Emily's garage?
Did you break into Spencer's house
and body-check me too?
That wasn't on purpose.
I felt bad.
I could tell.
You running away into the night was especially touching.
I panicked, okay?
So what?
What, you have something against my friends?
Couldn't you have just broken into some stranger's house?
I have.
I promise you, I won't do it again.
Just please, don't tell.
Unless you want mom and dad to start fighting again.
Hey, can I talk to you for a minute?
I know a lot has happened between us,
and I realize that if I expect you to be honest with me,
Then I need to be honest with you.
I was angry when you chose Ian over me,
and so that's why, when I--
Sweetie, will you do me a favor
and set the dining room table?
I'm gonna go set the table.
So, mom, I need your opinion.
Absolutely not.
What? I haven't even asked you yet.
Hanna, it's a funeral,
not a Nicki Minaj concert.
So what? I can't dance on his grave?
Can I at least throw confetti?
Hanna, we are there to support the Hastings.
It's hard enough burying someone everyone hates.
You don't need to call attention to it.
Is that how Grandpa's funeral was?
I wouldn't know.
Didn't go to my father's funeral.
Did anyone go?
I assume whatever live-in girlfriend he had at the time.
Well, then, how do you even know he had a funeral?
Because it took me forever to pay it off.
Had to spread it out over four credit cards.
Do you ever regret it?
Not going?
No.
I left town by the time I was 17,
and if I could have, I would have left sooner.
So what stopped you?
Freedom costs, Hanna.
Can't put everything on a credit card.
Who's ringing it this time?
Thanks for being here.
How's your family doing?
What are the cops doing here?
Um... my parents wanted them here
in case any uninvited guests showed up.
I thought my no-party-crashers policy
was strict.
I think Spencer means
"angry mob with torches" type guests.
I should probably get back to my family.
Thanks.
Spencer, wait.
It turns out Ian wasn't the one who hired Logan.
I can't talk about this now, Emily.
Look, I know this isn't the best place,
But you haven't called me back.
Because I don't want to talk about it, period.
I just can't do this anymore, okay?
Look, maybe Dr. Sullivan was right.
Maybe we are obsessed, and maybe that's what "A" wants,
for us to stay obsessed.
Did you ever think about that?
Keeping us suspended in time--
The years are passing us by,
and we're still rereading old suicide notes
and hunting down delivery boys for clues.
Don't you want to know the truth?
Don't we owe that to Alison?
It's not gonna bring her back.
Nothing we ever do is gonna bring her back,
and I need to focus on
keeping the people that are still here.
Ezra. I didn't know you were coming to this.
Uh... I didn't plan on it.
Hey.
But after speaking with Aria,
I realized how important it is
to... um...
show my support for all the students by coming--
not only for Spencer, but for all the students
affected by the tragedies of this past year.
I'm sure the kids really appreciate it.
Come on, sit with us.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Sure.
I know this is gonna sound weird, but...
I didn't know who else to talk to at this point.
What's on your mind, Emily?
It wasn't Ian who hired Logan Reed,
the guy who delivered the money in the woods.
He never met Ian. He was hired by a woman.
And... how do you know this?
He works at that delivery service on Van Owen.
I spoke to him.
Well, that's definitely strange,
But we're just about to bury the killer.
What are you... asking me to do here?
I... I don't know.
If it'll make you sleep better,
I'll try to find out who that woman is.
You did the right thing, telling me.
Okay.
Thank you.
You waiting for Fitz?
Uh... Just waiting for my parents.
Who's he waiting for?
I don't know.
Maybe he came here for the same reason we did.
To spit on Ian's grave?
To get closure.
Well... I still think he's creepy.
Even if he wasn't hiding Ian,
the guy's a freak, and he always has been.
I'm gonna go.
Tell your parents I said goodbye.
Okay. Bye.
Aria.
Can I talk to you?
Yeah. Should I round up the rest of the student body
so you can just address us as a group?
Look, I really did come here to see you,
to take the next step, but it just wasn't right.
Well, do you know when the exact right place and time is?
Because we keep talking about slowly moving forward
and dipping our toes in the pool.
Aria, telling your parents is not toe-dipping,
It's a cannonball.
I know.
Ohh. This would be so much easier
if I could just blame it all on you.
Thanks.
You know what I mean.
I know that this isn't anybody's fault.
That doesn't change the fact that I-
I really needed a hug from you today.
Not... later at your apartment
or tomorrow at Hollis,
but here, right now.
I'll-- I'll call you, later.
Excuse me. Hello?
Janet.
Yeah?
Hi. I'm Hanna. I'm a friend of Caleb's.
That's nice, hon. I'm sorry. I'm in a hurry.
This won't take long.
I just want to let you know
that I know about your deal with Caleb.
Deal?
You know what I'm talking about,
and it's gonna have to stop.
Do you see that lady over there?
That's my mom.
She's also a senior partner at the firm of
汉娜随口编的名字都离不开名牌
Dolce & Gabbana and Leibowitz,
so I suggest that you give Caleb his money
and continue to give him his money until he turns 18,
or I'll have to unleash Erin Brockovich on you
and haul your butt into court.
Thanks again for... helping my brother out.
Why are you so willing to give my brother a free pass?
I don't know.
Maybe it's 'cause
Ali used to threaten to turn me in all the time.
Did she ever?
Ali was too smart for that.
Even as a kid.
She was fearless.
She needed to be.
I was always jealous of that.
Of her.
I guess that's why
my parents can't even look at me anymore--
They know they lost the wrong kid.
Don't say that.
Look...
Maybe you coming here today was a mistake.
Just the opposite, actually.
You don't know how good it feels
to know it wasn't me.
I don't remember a thing
from the night Ali died.
I blacked out and woke up the next morning
with a wicked hangover and...
and this.
Who gave you this?
What-- what does this mean?
I don't know, but... it almost destroyed me.
You thought that you killed her?
Like I said, I was jealous,
and when I got loaded, I got angry.
But...
Ian's confession has changed everything.
He did it, not me.
Hey, I'm going out. Do you need anything?
It's a girl.
It is?
Yeah.
Congratulations.
I'm sorry I chose Ian over you.
I just... couldn't believe that he would ever...
do that to someone.
Finding out he wasn't who I thought he was,
it's like... losing him twice.
I'm so sorry.
No.
I deserve it.
I've lied so much
to you, to the cops, to mom and dad.
God, I thought I was protecting an innocent man.
We all make mistakes. I-I have too.
A couple of days ago, I found your r--
Wait, Spencer. Let me get this out while I have the courage.
There's something that you don't know, and--
Why do you have Ian's phone?
I don't know.
Wait a minute.
You-- you sent me those texts?
What? No!
I know he's been dead over a week!
I know he didn't send me those messages!
No, Melissa, I didn't!
You pretended to be Ian? How could you do that to me?
I swear to you, I didn't!
You must really hate me!
I will never forgive you for this!
Honey, you're starting to scare me.
You've washed clothes that haven't even been worn yet.
I can't help it. Everything just feels dirty.
Come on, let's go downstairs and have a glass of wine.
Or scotch.
Absinthe?
He was a coach at our children's school.
I used to say hi to him in the teachers' lounge.
You couldn't have known what he'd done.
None of us did.
He really seemed like a nice guy.
I guess we see what we want to see.
I'm going out, grab food with my friends.
Can you stop washing my sweats?
I smell like a candle.
I'll take that glass of absinthe now.
Count it if you like.
That's okay. I believe you.
Good. Then I guess I won't be seeing you again.
I guess not.
Hey, Jenna, it's me.
Yeah, don't worry. It's taken care of.
Mom!
Mom!
Hi. What's up?
I know the funeral was today.
I just wanted to come check on you...
And to give you this.
When rappers brag about showering their ladies with ice,
they mean something else.
I also got... this:
Soup dumplings and walnut shrimp.
That was sweet.
Before you get carried away,
It's gonna need to be reheated.
I probably should have sprung for two bags.
Look, Caleb, you really didn't have to do this.
How much do I owe you?
Nothing. I'm good.
Weirdest thing:
Janet showed up out of nowhere
and gave me an envelope filled with cash.
Really?
Yeah.
Wow. That's crazy.
I know. But I guess I shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth.
Yeah, especially when horse-face is giving you money!
Well, I should probably go.
Goonies is on TV tonight.
Promised Lucas I'd watch it with him.
Oh. All right, well, that sounds fun.
You must not have heard me.
I said we're watching Goonies tonight.
What was that for?
Dolce, Gabbana & Leibowitz?
Wait.
Okay, if we get caught, we are in so much trouble!
Oh, please.
Like we're the first teenagers to sneak in a graveyard?
It's like chapter one of every Stephen King book.
Guys! Not helping.
Okay, I think we're close.
Wait. Stop.
I'm-- I'm not going any further
until you tell me why we're here.
I told you, I think "A" set us up.
And I do too.
Emily's right. This isn't over.
I thought I'd feel differently once we buried Ian,
but I don't,
and it's because "A" is still alive and calling the shots.
But what does that mean?
I think "A" took the body
And made it look like a suicide.
Why would "A" do that?
So that the confession in the suicide note
makes Ali's murder look like an open-and-shut case.
But that would mean that "A" was helping us.
This whole time, we've been trying to convince the police that Ian killed Ali.
Exactly.
And why would "A" help us
when we know that "A" ultimately wants to hurt us?
Ugh! I'm confused, and I'm stepping on something mushy.
What Spence means is, how do we know for sure
that Ian is Ali's killer?
What do you mean? The "Kissing Rock" video.
And-- and the missing tree.
"A" gave us those things.
"A" is the one who handed us Ali's killer on a silver platter.
And whatever "A" gives, the bitch takes back.
Guys, look.
I know you want to kiss me.
Come closer.
Where's it coming from?
Oh, my god!
She was still alive!
Thanks for meeting me.
I definitely think the projector's over here.
I don't know. Had to be closer.
Are you sure it wasn't further away?
Wasn't it on the ground?
