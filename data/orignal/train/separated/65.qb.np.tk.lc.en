the evidence does not support the finding
that my client is guilty of premeditated murder .
alicia ? alicia ?
alicia ?
your honor , the trial is over .
the jury has heard the evidence .
the arguments now are purely about
your jury instructions , that &apos;s all ...
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re arguing , your honor ...
mr. agos ?
i know that interruption is a standard trope
of today &apos;s modern discourse ,
but do you happen to remember what i said about it ?
you said you didn &apos;t like it .
yes . if you did it again ?
i was gonna have to go sit down .
that &apos;s right .
thank you , your honor .
the prosecution worries they failed to
make their case for first @-@ degree murder .
we sympathize .
we don &apos;t think they made their case , either .
our client is innocent .
officer fisher didn &apos;t kill her husband .
she didn &apos;t take her service revolver
and shoot him in the head .
yes , i see your hand , counselor .
are you finished , ms. lockhart ?
yes , i am , your honor .
the defense is forcing the jury
into an all @-@ or @-@ nothing deliberation--
first @-@ degree murder or not guilty .
you &apos;re the ones who fought the all @-@ or @-@ nothing prosecution ...
mr. coyne .
thank you , your honor .
the evidence at trial is what should guide your decision .
the jury heard evidence
from which they could reasonably conclude that the elements
of second @-@ degree murder have not been met ...
ms. venegas . yes .
yes , i received your message , ma &apos;am .
i &apos;m so sorry , but we can &apos;t accommodate you .
we limit enrollment to the beginning of the year .
i understand . it &apos;s just ...
i know occasionally you make exceptions .
for legacy students , yes .
my children were students at your elementary school
before my husband and i moved away .
he &apos;s the new state &apos;s attorney , you know .
oh , peter florrick ?
i wasn &apos;t making the connection .
yes , and he would be thrilled if we could work this out .
let &apos;s just meet to discuss .
certainly . but you understand i can &apos;t make any promises .
oh , yes , i understand . does tomorrow at 10 : 00 work ?
great !
thank you so much , ms. venegas . i &apos;ll see you then .
peter , hi .
i set up a meeting with the headmistress at capstone .
really ? i thought they said no .
they did , but they &apos;re open to a meeting ,
and it wouldn &apos;t hurt if you gave them a call .
she seemed ... persuadable .
when is the meeting ?
it &apos;s tomorrow at 10 : 00 , but you don &apos;t have to go .
i &apos;ll go .
okay .
tomorrow at 10 : 00 .
and ... i think she liked the state &apos;s attorney thing , so ...
i &apos;ll play it up . okay ?
all right , bye .
what happened ?
the judge won &apos;t instruct on second @-@ degree murder .
it &apos;s judge dunaway . you said he leaned toward the prosecution .
he used to .
where &apos;s the jury on this ?
i don &apos;t think we convinced them of first degree .
you agree ?
i think the jury likes her .
i don &apos;t think we made the sale on premeditation .
so , why didn &apos;t we ?
we had a witness that fell through .
and some of the motions ... they just didn &apos;t go our way .
make the deal .
they &apos;ll want manslaughter .
manslaughter , no . second degree , four years .
where the hell are all the tough @-@ on @-@ crime judges these days ?
mr. gardner .
one second .
i don &apos;t want things to be awkward .
i so don &apos;t want things to be awkward .
good . then they won &apos;t be .
so , that &apos;s it then , isn &apos;t it ?
what ?
we just decide it , and it &apos;s so ?
yep . we &apos;re adults .
alicia ?
looks like you &apos;re needed .
then i &apos;ll get back to work .
thank you .
you have no reason to thank me , alicia .
no reason at all .
i have these discovery documents
for you to go over ...
well fought , cary .
you &apos;ve become quite the litigator .
thank you , diane . we try to keep you guys honest .
so , we have an offer .
we probably should hurry , or the jury will be in soon .
second degree , four years .
diane , you still there ?
yes , i &apos;m here .
we &apos;re just thinking it over .
we &apos;ll take it to our client .
but she &apos;ll be much more inclined if you offer probation .
it &apos;s not going to be probation .
she killed her husband for the insurance money .
he committed suicide .
come on , he committed suicide
with her service revolver ... ? !
too bad you couldn &apos;t shake the alibi .
okay , let &apos;s not go over this again .
we &apos;ll , we &apos;ll take it to our client , cary .
that &apos;s all we can say .
okay , do .
just know you &apos;re not getting any better than this , okay , diane ?
bye .
yes !
yes !
oh ! oh , well done !
they &apos;re offering second @-@ degree murder .
four years .
four years ?
the statutory minimum .
you &apos;ll be out in one .
it &apos;s good news , lauryn .
they &apos;re worried about their case ;
that &apos;s why they &apos;re making an offer .
so i should wait for a verdict ?
i don &apos;t know . juries are unpredictable .
you &apos;re not saying much .
i don &apos;t have much to say .
well , what should i do ?
a year in prison or roll the dice with a verdict ?
i think ... that you need to make that decision , lauryn .
you can &apos;t defer to anyone else .
you know what you did ; you know what you didn &apos;t do .
you also know sometimes that doesn &apos;t matter .
it comes down to two things : the skill of your lawyers ,
and the jury .
you have good lawyers .
the trial went our way , but the jury ...
is an unknown .
they &apos;re your peers .
and i &apos;ve never understood my peers .
i didn &apos;t do this .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m going to pass on this deal .
i can &apos;t spend another day in prison for something i didn &apos;t do .
i &apos;ll roll the dice .
okay .
then we sit and wait for the jury .
oh , yeah , i talked with that headmistress .
she &apos;s a real piece of work .
so , we &apos;ll split the cost .
no , i &apos;ve got it .
we &apos;re going to split the cost of private school , alicia .
that &apos;s non @-@ negotiable .
okay , thanks .
where are we at with grace ?
no tv , no computer except homework .
no calls except to us .
and no calling jimmy patrick .
that &apos;s that christian kid she was with ?
yeah . i &apos;m gonna talk to him .
oh , no , no , no , i &apos;ll talk to him .
no , i will .
i &apos;m just bringing my computer for my homework .
dad is keeping track .
yeah , and dad &apos;s a lot meaner than mom .
dad , do i get to drive ?
call me on your way to school tomorrow .
okay .
love you .
love you .
see ya .
joan of arc , as only cable can tell it .
if only the armagnacs and the burgundians
would unite under one leadership .
does monsieur want me to wash between the legs ?
oui .
but then there &apos;s burgundy ,
and this insufferable peace treat ...
hi , it &apos;s me .
i know i shouldn &apos;t have called ...
are you sure ? it &apos;s not too late ?
hey , sis .
you &apos;re lonely . that &apos;s the problem .
i &apos;m lonely . i know i &apos;m lonely .
so go call him .
who ?
will .
owen , you &apos;re not listening to me .
i have kids .
you don &apos;t have kids . they &apos;re with peter .
what ?
do you suddenly become a non @-@ sexual person
just because you have kids ?
no . i am a parent .
and i have to stop being irresponsible .
how are you being irresponsible ?
i &apos;m married .
then get divorced .
you &apos;re not catholic .
nobody &apos;s gonna send you to hell .
are you in love with will ?
no , i don &apos;t think i am .
seriously ?
seriously .
i think i was in love with &quot; it . &quot;
you know , the attention .
the ...
raw , animalistic sex ?
yeah .
but ... i didn &apos;t like the lying .
and i ... and i don &apos;t like ... i mean , he &apos;s my boss .
then quit .
i don &apos;t mean quit working .
i mean , quit that job . get another one .
it &apos;s too complicated . i don &apos;t like complications .
i need friends .
then get friends . you @-@ you had good friends .
yeah , i did , didn &apos;t i ?
where are they all ?
probably on facebook .
what about ... try that tennis woman ,
what was her name ?
it was like a governmental agency ... fema ?
senna .
she was nice , wasn &apos;t she ?
oh , this can &apos;t be good .
hello .
now ?
i &apos;d like to thank the jury for their diligence
and insisting on staying past dinner .
i understand we have a verdict .
we do , your honor .
mr. foreman , you may read the verdict .
we , the jury , find the defendant ,
lauryn fisher , guilty of murder in the first degree .
no .
get kalinda ; she &apos;s on her way in .
kalinda , it &apos;s guilty .
your honor , we ask ...
would you like me to poll the jury ?
yes , your honor .
ladies and gentlemen of the jury ,
the defense would like to make certain
that all members of the jury support this verdict ,
so i will ask you one at a time for your individual verdicts .
it isn &apos;t over , lauryn , not by a long shot .
juror number one , what is your verdict ?
guilty .
actually , sir ,
you have to say , &quot; guilty of murder in the first degree . &quot;
sorry .
guilty of murder in the first degree .
juror number two , what is your verdict ?
guilty of murder in the first degree .
juror number three , what is your verdict ?
guilty of murder in the first degree .
juror number four , what is your verdict ?
guilty of murder in the first degree .
juror number five , what is your verdict ?
i ...
guilty of murder ... in the first degree .
sorry . i &apos;m so sorry .
juror number six , what is your verdict ?
guilty of murder in the first degree .
juror number 12,
what is your verdict ?
not guilty of ...
guilty of murder in the first degree .
well , thank you , jurors , that ends your service .
we will reconvene on friday for sentencing .
good night .
the judge is not happy .
i know , we may have an opening .
lauryn , this isn &apos;t over yet .
we can try and get this overturned .
or a mistrial or a judgment notwithstanding the verdict .
i &apos;ve never seen anything like it .
that verdict doesn &apos;t make sense .
something happened in the jury room .
i got to get moving .
right .
we want a reversal , something before sentencing on friday .
we have a sympathetic judge .
all right , let &apos;s find out what went wrong .
陪审团休息室
thanks , brad .
it will be put to good use .
sorry to bother you .
you might recognize me from the defense .
yes .
it really helps us evaluate our performance
to hear from the jurors
what they think we did right and wrong ,
so if you don &apos;t mind talking ...
i don &apos;t think i &apos;m supposed to .
oh , no , that &apos;s just during the trial .
you have the right to say anything you want after the verdict .
this isn &apos;t over .
what &apos;s now ?
they &apos;re out talking to jurors .
they &apos;re going for a reversal .
or judgment notwithstanding .
it &apos;s just kind of late .
i understand .
why don &apos;t i just take your number
and i &apos;ll call you tomorrow ?
ten minutes tops .
you don &apos;t have to talk to her .
he &apos;s well within his rights , cary .
i explained to him .
yes , but have you explained
that he don &apos;t have to talk to you at all ?
just so you know , sir , defense attorneys will try
and contact you and question you in an attempt
to compromise your verdict .
i &apos;m doing nothing wrong , cary .
here &apos;s my number if they do .
you can bring them up on charges of harassment .
what are you doing there , kalinda ?
how are you , dana ?
i was just enjoying the night air .
it looked to me like you were taking pictures
of the jurors &apos; license plates .
really ?
i thought i was taking notes
that are both legally obtainable
and legally obtained .
i &apos;m warning you now , kalinda .
if any of those jurors call harassment on you ,
i will personally toss you in jail .
i feel warned .
thank you .
last on the voting all 12 guiltys ,
and my guess-- this would be dinner .
here &apos;s a not guilty .
and another .
second @-@ to @-@ last round-- looks like we had
two holdouts .
ugh , chinese .
oh , looks like we hit lunch .
not guilty
not guilty .
not guilty .
9 not guilties in that round .
we went from nine not guiltys to ten guiltys
in one round of voting ?
and that was just after lunch .
what happened at lunch ?
this is a livery horn button , 1840s ,
perfect backmark .
oh , it &apos;s beautiful .
do you collect buttons ?
no , but i sure can see the fascination for them .
i guess i &apos;m a bit obsessed .
that &apos;s what everybody says
i have my own button blog
lisa &apos;s world of buttons-- all one word .
you must blog a lot .
oh , yeah ,
i &apos;ll go crazy if i don &apos;t blog twice a day
crazier than i already am now .
do you mind if i just record this just for my own notes ?
sure , no problem , but i don &apos;t see how i can help .
well-- thank you-- you seemed ,
you seemed really upset
by the verdict .
did you feel the pressure to vote with everyone else ?
oh , no ,
no , just don &apos;t like to get up in front of people .
i get a little bit dramatic .
that must have looked awful .
i cry at the drop of a hat .
so you , you don &apos;t regret the verdict ?
oh , no , no , i didn &apos;t trust that lady .
she killed her husband for the insurance money .
i can &apos;t think of anything worse .
you must have made a ...
made a very convincing case to the other jurors
to get them to change their vote .
i understand ...
that is beautiful , isn &apos;t it ?
i understand the vote was leaning toward not guilty .
yeah , for a while .
am i supposed to talk about this ?
oh , the other jurors did .
they said at they changed their minds just after lunch .
what happened during lunch ?
nothing-- i mean , we read the testimony .
the foreman thought we should .
what testimony ?
the partner , the other cop ,
the one who said he was with her .
the alibi witness-- you didn &apos;t believe him ?
nah , he was so full of himself in that uniform .
would you like to see a 1780
georgian irish militia button ?
mint condition . mint
sergeant alden ?
he was our best witness .
i know . she didn &apos;t believe him .
they reread his testimony just after lunch ,
and that &apos;s what turned people toward guilty .
that makes no sense .
you might also want to get someone to check her blog :
lisa &apos;s world of buttons .
she &apos;s on that twice a day .
she might have updated during the trial .
good . alicia , can you get on that ?
yeah , in about a half hour .
where are you , alicia ?
a prior engagement-- i &apos;ll be right in .
kalinda , where are you going next ?
the foreman-- he seemed open to talking .
okay , good .
stay in touch .
uh , you , too , alicia .
and , alicia , uh , let &apos;s talk when you get back .
okay .
well , i do hope you consider
moving back to the neighborhood .
i &apos;d love to , but you know civil servant pay .
oh , my goodness , i do .
i used to teach public school-- social studies .
sorry about that . work .
usually it &apos;s the husbands ducking out to take calls .
we take turns .
anyway , i hope you &apos;ll make an exception for our kids
because i think you &apos;ll really love zach and grace .
well , i &apos;m sure i will .
i very much want to .
let me see what i can do .
i forgot how good you were at that .
at what ?
charming the teachers .
it &apos;s the height-- they respect the height .
so are we going to let zach drive all this way ?
it &apos;s only another 20 minutes .
and grace ?
what about grace ?
she made a mistake .
i worry we screwed up our kids .
you worry that i screwed up the kids .
that &apos;s true .
what did you say ?
i said it just seems odd .
yeah , we sometime see split votes veering one way or the other ,
but to have a complete turnaround
leaning from not guilty to guilty
in a matter of hours just seems odd .
i guess i must be odd then
because i was voting not guilty .
until you read the testimony of the alibi witness ?
yes , i mean , it just didn &apos;t seem to hold up .
i think when you have a policeman there
in uniform in person , you get persuaded ,
but then when you read it out loud ,
you start to see the holes .
okay , kalinda , that &apos;s it .
hello , cary .
i already warned you once .
you &apos;re under arrest .
for what ?
section 5324a .
harassment of jurors .
mr. alvarez , am i harassing you ?
it doesn &apos;t matter what he says .
he &apos;s a public employee , and his supervisor over there
is insisting you &apos;re preventing him from executing his duties
are you serious ?
i &apos;m very serious .
please place your hands behind your back .
you know this won &apos;t stand up .
i know you &apos;ll be out of circulation for a day or two .
hey , what &apos;s up ?
they supposedly have something for a mistrial .
when ?
right now .
get in here .
good , there you are , as a lodge .
the defense claims to have evidence of jury misconduct .
the defense is desperate , your honor .
at a certain point , justice has to be done ...
it &apos;s being done-- this is how justice works .
what do you have , ms. lockhart ?
improper contact between a juror and nonparticipant
is considered jury misconduct , your honor .
discussing a case
with friends , relatives
during the trial or deliberations .
one of our jurors has done just that .
which juror ?
juror number five--
lisa banner .
she &apos;s written on her blog
during deliberations .
oh , come on .
&quot; you &apos;re probably wondering why i &apos;ve been away for a few days .
&quot; i &apos;m on jury duty-- a murder .
i know it &apos;s supposed to be exiting
i think she meant &quot; exciting . &quot;
oh , i &apos;m sure she did .
... &quot; but you can &apos;t believe how long this is taking .
&quot; i sit in this room staring at these people
who can &apos;t make up their minds . &quot;
yes , i &apos;d imagined you &apos;d have something to say , ms. lodge .
your honor , ms. banner
has broken a key rule of deliberations .
she has discussed the case
with those outside of the jury .
her blog received 45,000 individual hits on the day in question ,
so ms. banner shared her views
with 45,000 non @-@ jury members .
god , how i hate that word &quot; blog . &quot;
ms. lodge .
your honor ,
this gives new meaning to reaching .
that blog entry was generic ,
unspecific , and unknowing .
i regrettably agree , ms. lockhart .
ms. banner &apos;s banal observations hardly rise to
the level of improper contact ,
though i &apos;d love to jail her for syntax alone .
your honor , we would argue that you censure the defense .
they are sifting through personal lives of juries
on a fishing expedition for a mistrial .
no , ms. lodge , this was an unjust verdict .
you know that and i know that .
that &apos;s not true .
it is true ,
but the law was followed , ms. lockhart .
i would love to overturn this , but you have to give me more .
your honor , i would like to get your comments on the record .
they are on the record . that &apos;s what judith is doing over there .
what &apos;d i just say , judith ?
&quot; they are the record . that &apos;s what judith is doing over there . &quot;
bring me something more , ms. lockhart .
the law is the law .
yes ?
you know our investigation
into lockhart / gardner ?
i think i may have stumbled upon another judge they bribed .
come on in .
i was so thrilled when you called .
i &apos;ve been wondering how the old friends are doing .
you &apos;re not in touch with anyone ?
no , when i got divorced , i moved across town .
how you and peter doing ?
well .
good , great .
you &apos;re our bill and hillary .
have you heard of mosous ?
the ... ?
mosous .
they &apos;re these people in southwest china
who organize their lives around a woman &apos;s sexual desire .
oh , no .
th @-@ they completely separate sex from family .
the mosou women get to decide which men they &apos;ll sleep with ,
how long , how many .
all these mosou men come knocking on the door
of their babahougas at night--that &apos;s their flower rooms--
and the women decide which ones to let in .
and when they &apos;re done , it &apos;s up to the women whether the men stay or go .
and that &apos;s when i realized--
that &apos;s what i &apos;m missing from my life .
control . you have to read this book .
it &apos;ll open your eyes .
so , how are you doing ?
good .
so , try one of your other tennis buddies , they can &apos;t all be like that .
yeah , but what if are ?
what if i have spent a decade of my life making the wrong friends ?
start making new ones . nothing &apos;s over till it &apos;s over .
well , thank you .
i have to go yell at someone now . talk to you later .
hello .
hi . i &apos;m grace &apos;s mom .
i already talke to grace .
i don &apos;t want her to contact you again ,
and i don &apos;t want you contacting her . do you understand ?
i do .
but just so you know , mrs. florrick ,
i thought she had your permission .
she didn &apos;t . and she doesn &apos;t .
okay .
but she really should be going to church .
that &apos;s up to me .
that is not up to you .
i don &apos;t want you contacting her again .
she already told me . don &apos;t worry .
you talked to grace ?
no , i mean , your assistant already told me .
my assistant ?
the one who came for grace at the church .
the one who ripped into me .
what are you talking about ?
your assistant at work . kalinda .
kalinda ?
she ...
i don &apos;t understand .
she came and got grace .
and said i should never talk to her again
or she would hurt me .
she ... i ...
i don &apos;t understand how did ...
how did she find grace ?
mom , she told us not to say anything .
yes , but now i &apos;m telling you to say something . what happened ?
she used some software to trace grace &apos;s cell phone ,
but it was dead , so she ..
drove to see where grace was .
and why didn &apos;t she want you to tell me ?
i don &apos;t think she thought you wanted to know .
mom , i have to get to class .
listen , zach ...
zach ... i &apos;m not angry ,
but we don &apos;t keep things from each other ?
okay . sorry , mom .
that &apos;s okay . we &apos;ll talk later . i love you .
&quot; be sorry . &quot;
thank you , alicia , for dropping by .
we just don &apos;t talk as much as we used to .
well , it &apos;s , uh , been very busy .
and you &apos;ve ... been distracted .
well , i was just dealing with some home issues ,
but that &apos;s all taken care of now .
good .
you &apos;re valuable to us , alicia .
when i worked with , stern years ago , we were ... very close .
and as a woman , it was very helpful
to be that closely associated to a powerful man .
but only to a point .
people tended not to give me credit for my own successes .
all i &apos;m trying to say is ,
women need to help women--
the way you &apos;re helping caitlin ;
the way i am here to help you .
i want you to get serious about the partner track .
really ?
yes .
i &apos;ve been watching you . you have it in you .
but you can &apos;t get distracted .
not with family , not with ... friendships here .
you have to keep your eye on the ball .
i can &apos;t change that i have a family .
no one wants you to .
but rising to a certain level as you have ,
alicia , there are only two paths open to you now :
rising further or falling to earth .
and that &apos;s why i want to help you ,
to offer you my friendship ... and my advice .
okay .
i got something from the jury room .
oh good , more from the trash .
nah , a threat . from one juror to another . look .
&quot; change your vote or you &apos;ll be sorry &quot; ?
but the problem is , we can &apos;t use this .
yeah , we &apos;re not supposed to even have this trash .
can we tell who it was written by ?
or to ? i mean , if @-@ if we could question these jurors ,
we could get it independently .
we could compare the handwriting .
good . where is kalinda ?
she was arrest .
when ?
an hour ago . a friend at the courthouse just called me--
she &apos;s g held on a juror harassment charge .
okay , well , let &apos;s bail her out .
i &apos;ll do it .
are you sure ?
yes . i &apos;ll go .
thank you for seeing me .
you &apos;re welcome , ms. scott @-@ carr .
not sure what i can do for you .
well , your honor ,
i &apos;ve been assigned a case involving judicial corruption .
really ?
yes .
and i was wondering , as a part of my investigation ,
has any lawyer approached you about a bribe ?
no , no lawyer has .
good . that &apos;s ... that &apos;s good to know .
now , you know that bribes are not always ...
in the form of cash . they can often be in form of gifts ,
or even the forgiving of debts .
harvard law review .
this is ...
my article
on judicial misconduct .
worth a read sometime .
please don &apos;t confuse my meaning ,
your honor .
due diligence requires some uncomfortable questions .
yes . and so does undue influence .
are you suggesting that i &apos;m influencing you ?
no , i &apos;m suggesting you &apos;re attempting to influence me .
you were close with will gardner .
you used to play in his wednesday night basketball games .
we &apos;ve pinpointed these games as a prime nexus
for illegal gambling and bribery .
and i am friendly to his partner ,
diane lockhart ,
in her current case-- isn &apos;t that what you &apos;re suggesting ?
yes .
and you ...
are attempting to use your position as a special prosecutor
to pressure me to decide for the prosecution
in this ongoing case .
well ... that &apos;s where you &apos;re wrong , sir .
there is no ongoing case .
the verdict is in .
how you doing ?
&apos;cause you &apos;re looking a little pale .
yep , hands behind your back .
kalinda sharma .
she was brought in a few hours ago .
yes .
oh . i &apos;m sorry , ma &apos;am ,
but kalinda sharma has been transferred .
where ?
she took ill ,
and she s transferred to a local hospital for treatment .
come on . this is a game .
that &apos;s all i know , ma &apos;am .
take it or leave it .
let me put this to you simply , cary .
unless you want a lawsuit the likes you &apos;ve never seen ,
i would stop this shell game with kalinda .
because i have three pro bono clients
who have suffered the same transferring of relatives and loved ones ,
and if i can prove a systematic effort
to elude arraignment and bail hearings ,
well , then we &apos;re talking about damages in the millions--
and more importantly ,
i &apos;ll be naming you personally in that lawsuit .
hi , alicia .
i am not joking , cary .
you bring kalinda to me now .
thanks .
you found grace ?
you found my daughter ?
she wasn &apos;t lost .
you brought her home .
she would have come home on her own .
you told my kids not to tell me . why ?
i don &apos;t want mess .
what mess ?
alicia , i haven &apos;t changed .
i &apos;m the same person .
i ... i knew i could help , so i helped , that &apos;s all .
thank you .
you don &apos;t have to ...
no .
you didn &apos;t have to .
that &apos;why i &apos;m thanking you .
you &apos;re welcome .
here we all are again .
what have you got for us today , ms. lockhart ?
juror number 12 , your honor ,
mr. grant rudnick .
he has something he would to say .
uh , yes . your honor
i &apos;m sorry , i should have said this before .
this note was given to me
in the jury room .
oh , come on ,
your honor , this is ridiculous .
5324a , your honor :
jury tampering , or bullying ,
falls well within the judge &apos;s right to declare a mistrial .
i know , i interrupted mr. agos .
i will go sit down now .
the jury &apos;s decided , your honor , and the defense
shouldn &apos;t be allowed to keep throwing crap against the wall .
thank you , mr. agos ,
but i think it &apos;s my job to figure out what is crap .
mr. rudnick ,
did this threat changed your view of the case ?
your honor , that &apos;s not the point . the mere fact ...
ms. lockhart , i didn &apos;t ask you a question .
mr. rudnick ... did this note change your mind about the case ?
no .
so ...
when i polled the jury in court and you said
&quot; guilty in the first degree , &quot; were you telling the truth ?
i guess so , sure .
ms. lockhart , mr. coyne , again ...
nice effort ,
but i deny your request for a mistrial ,
and i ask that you be more circumspect in the future
with your approaches to jury members .
damn it !
what happened ?
he &apos;s afraid to go out on a limb .
who threatened you , mr. rudnick ?
who wrote that ? the foreman .
i forget his name .
but it &apos;s not like to take it seriously .
i was just one of the holdouts .
and i think he just wanted to finish up that night .
what ? i don &apos;t undersnd is ,
the foreman was one of the &quot; not guilty &quot; votes ,
and then , after lunch , not only does he change his vote ,
but he pressures another juror
to overturn his vote ?
kalinda , what are you doing ?
anything you want .
i &apos;m on my way .
three deccan buttons ,
all with irises .
oh , i like the middle one especially .
thank you . i do , too .
so , uh , did you talk much about the case during lunch ?
no . we honored the judge &apos;s instructions .
and was mario with you ?
he &apos;s the foreman .
most days he was during the trial .
but deliberations-- no .
he said he had to do something next door .
next door to what ?
chopsticks shack . we &apos;d go there every day .
do you remember what was next door ?
he used a computer in an internet cafe over lunch .
he had to pay with a credit card ,
so , i was able to find out which computer he used .
and this is a cache of the searches that he did during the hour .
what was he looking for ?
articles on our alibi witness , sergeant alden .
what was it , a grudge ?
no .
alden shot an hispanic youth in 2002 .
yup . he was cleared of charges ,
but there was lot of controversy
because the youth was unarmed .
many members of the latino community accused him
of lying during the inquest .
and sergeant alden is black . not a lot of love lost there .
so you think he changed his vote
when he realized it was the same officer ?
yeah . but i don &apos;t think he made the connection
until he was in the middle of deliberations .
he checked , and then , he persuaded the other jurors .
we need to take this to the judge .
no . we need more .
why ?
this is exactly what judge dunaway is talking about .
no , no , no . something has changed there . we need more .
we could get affidavits from the other jurors .
if they &apos;ll swear that the foreman brought in outside evidence
to the jury room , that might work .
ok , i &apos;m on it .
i &apos;ll help .
hello . alicia florrick .
mrs. florrick .
i was hoping to get your voice mail .
i just wanted to apologize .
it doesn &apos;t look like it will work out for your kids after all .
really ? why ?
well , first of all , i &apos;m so sorry to disapoint you .
i &apos;m just trying not to set an unfortunate precedent .
i hope you understand .
mrs. florrick ? hello ?
peter florrick .
hey .
alicia .
what &apos;s the matter ?
what ?
all right , don &apos;t worry .
i &apos;ll handle it .
you back again . didn &apos;t get enough of my buttons .
uh , this is my colleague , alicia florrick .
you might recognize her from the trial ?
yes . hi .
i always liked what you were wearing .
miss banner , hi .
we were trying to get in touch with some of the other jurors .
we &apos;ve talked to three or four , and we were just wondering
if you had the names or numbers of the others .
i do . i friended them all
so we could stay in touch .
i &apos;m having a display of my buttons
at the indiana state fair ,
and i wanted to keep them all in touch .
here . here you go .
not all wanted to be friended ,
but that &apos;s half of them anyway .
thanks . this is so helpful .
oh , miss banner ?
lisa .
lisa , is that peter dunaway ? judge dunaway ?
yes , i sent him a friend request , too .
he seemed like such a nice man .
and he friend you back ?
yes . why ?
during the trial ?
yes .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i think we have our mistrial .
i never used to bite my nails .
now look at them . they &apos;re bleeding .
we have some hope .
thank you .
thanks for coming by .
no .
i &apos;m sorry .
when you asked me for my advice before
about whether you should take the deal or not ,
i &apos;m afraid ... i was abrupt with you .
it was the truth .
no . i mean , it was ,
but ... sometimes , the truth can be more ...
adorned .
i don &apos;t have a lot of friends coming by to see me .
i thought i would . i have a lot of friends .
this really gets you thinking about
how people say nice things and smile ,
and then never came to visit .
i think i can do with things less ... adorned .
i hope this works out .
i do , too .
oh . mr. florrick .
hello . how are you ?
good , ma &apos;am . very good .
i @-@ i wish you &apos;d made an appointment .
i just spoke to your wife .
unfortunately , we don &apos;t have any room for your two children ,
but i was saying , beginning next year ,
at the start of next year , we should have room .
you know what one of the advantages
of my position is , ms. venegas ?
no . i ...
i imagine there must be many .
no , not really .
but background checks--
through background checks-- are one of the great advantages .
as i was perusing through some of these background checks ,
i was somewhat surprised to find
that many of your teachers had ... issues .
of course , i was only checking as a concerned parent
who was thinking of sending his children here .
luckily , there were no sexual charges .
but there were quite a few felony duis ,
check kiting and ... drug charges .
you are the state &apos;s attorney , sir .
yes , ma &apos;am , i am .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m going to say this to you ...
very slowly .
i &apos;m the state &apos;s attorney .
you don &apos;t say no to me .
and you especially don &apos;t say no to me
when it concerns my children .
do you understand ?
i think the word you &apos;re looking for is &quot; yes . &quot;
good .
so ...
we &apos;ll be hearing from you .
are we thinking the third time is the charm , ms. lockhart ?
that is our hope , your honor .
well , i should warn you .
my patience is running thin .
the illinois code of judicial conduct .
&quot; judges should refrain from all individual connect
&quot; with a juror outside the presence of court
during a trial and deliberations . &quot;
yes . have you detected some contact i made with jurors ?
you friended one .
juror number five , lisa banner ,
the blogger of lisa &apos;s world of buttons .
i didn &apos;t friend her .
you did , your honor .
she sent you a friend request three days ago ,
and you responded in the affirmative .
because i &apos;m running for re @-@ election .
somebody friends me , i assume it &apos;s a supporter .
your honor , this is ...
i know this is .
your honor , this is serious grounds for a mistrial .
unknowingly or not ,
you made contact with a juror
during the trial .
this is a serious ethical breach .
i used to find this job eternally enlightening ,
even enjoyable .
not anymore , not a single day .
your honor ...
no .
i declare a mistrial .
let &apos;s take it back into court ,
make it official .
good job .
that &apos;s what i was talking about .
that &apos;ll get you partnership .
so you chased them all away ?
i don &apos;t believe i did anything of the kind , mr. gardner .
they found the better part of valor .
here &apos;s your problem .
you don &apos;t have any evidence , lady .
you have accusations .
and you &apos;re trying to sweat me .
well , i don &apos;t sweat easily .
then let &apos;s talk .
that &apos;s all i want to do .
just talk .
i &apos;m not after you .
i don &apos;t think you know who you &apos;re after .
oh , i know who i &apos;m after .
somebody who used to be involved in your basketball games years ago .
who are you talking about ?
peter florrick .
that &apos;s right .
it all comes full circle , doesn &apos;t it ?
only in cook county .
peter puts you in charge of an investigation into me ,
and you turn it back on him .
i ...
i &apos;m speechless .
peter &apos;s clean this term ,
but he wasn &apos;t his first term , was he ?
and you know where his weaknesses lie .
well , i know a lot of things .
then let &apos;s talk .
no .
yes .
it &apos;s the smart move .
no .
i &apos;m hiring myself a lawyer ...
and then we can talk .
the next we talk , it &apos;ll be in front of a grand jury .
