aw , man i &apos;m sorry .
this must be very tough for ya , huh .
so , i read this article in the paper the other day that says you &apos;re not supposed to throw rice at weddings ,
because when pigeons eat rice it kills them .

i &apos;m sorry . what was i supposed to do
stand up and shout &apos; hey , rachel , your butt is showing ! &apos;
yeah ! better you than barry &apos;s uncle !
oh my god this is sooo humiliating .
i think the only thing that tops that was , was ,
was when i was in the eight grade and i had to sing the copa cabana in front of the entire school .
i think i got about two lines into it before i ran and freaked out .
oh my god , my entire life is flashing before my eyes .
rach , hey look , i remember that , it wasn &apos;t so bad .
oh ross , would you stop , you got me , i &apos;m dating you .

min .
oh rach , you &apos;re still here ,
at our wedding , they were packing up the chopped liver about now .
yeah , i love that story .
um , i got a question for you guys .
why do people keep is saying that is good to see me up and about ?
well uh , after you ran out on your wedding ,
barry &apos;s parents told people that you were sort of .... insane .
insane !
... from the syphilis .
what ? !
yeah , what are they gonna say ? you didn &apos;t love me anymore . come on .
your choices were that or syphilis ?
sweetie , at least this puts your whole tushy show into perspective .
angela ? joey tribiani .
listen , what are ya doing tonight ?
i know your seeing that guy , i was thinking maybe you could bring him .....
aren &apos;t you gonna answer her , that &apos;s like the tenth bing @-@ bong message she sent .
she wants to know what &apos;s wrong ?
what &apos;s wrong ? what &apos;s wrong ? you &apos;re married that &apos;s what &apos;s wrong .
oh , my . - what ?
she wants to meet you in person .
hey , look , phoebe i wanted to meet her in person too ,
okay , but she &apos;s married , she has a husband .
what if the husband person is the wrong guy , and you are the right guy .
i mean you don &apos;t get chances like this all the time ,
if you don &apos;t meet her now , you &apos;re gonna be kicking yourself when your 80
which is hard to do , and that &apos;s how you break a hip .
i don &apos;t know .
listen . those are the bing @-@ bongs of a woman in love with you .
okay , i &apos;ll do it !
oh , yeah ! okay ! great ! go , man , go put on your shoes , and , and march out there and meet her !
oh , wait , no , no you have to take a shower , &apos; cause , eww .
no , you know what you have to answer her , answer her first .
no , no , you know what make some coffee &apos; cause its too much .
okay , one more , please . come on , i &apos;m gonna get it in this time , i will .
okay , last chance .
again , i &apos;m sorry .
you know what , maybe i don &apos;t need to have children .
you know maybe i just think i do because that is what society ,
and by that i mean my mom ,
has always convinced me that i ...
i do ,
i have to have children , i &apos;m sorry . i just do .
yo ! can i have your attention , please ,
best man , making a toast here .
thank you .
i remember when barry got home from his first date with rachel ...
what , you hired the same band i can &apos;t use the same speech .
thank you , thank you very much .
anyway , i wish you both a
wonderful life together .
and rachel ...
what .
no , no , no now in all seriousness ,
its not a lot of women would &apos;ve had the guts to come back here tonight ,
and even fewer , who would do it with their asses hanging out !
uh , i like to , uh , to add something to that ...
why are you adding , why are you adding , why are you adding , why are you adding ?
most of you don &apos;t know me , i &apos;m rachel &apos;s boyfriend .
oh dear god .
ross ,
uh and uh , i &apos;d just like to say
that it did take a lot of courage for rachel to come here tonight .
and , uh , for the record
she did not run out on barry because she had syphilis .
what are you doing i &apos;m serious .
uh , the reason she walked out on , on barry is simply that she didn &apos;t love him ,
which incidentally worked out pretty well for me
so , to review : rachel ... took a lot of courage ...
doesn &apos;t have the syphilis ... and wound up with me .
cheers !
see you in the parking lot .
no , rach !
and once again she is out of here .
okay who had 9 : 45 ? um ?
ya , know what barr , i &apos;m not gonna leave .
i probably should , but i &apos;m not ,
see &apos; cause i promised myself that i would make it through at least * one * of your weddings .
see now , tonight , all i really wanted was
to make it though this evening with a little bit of grace and dignity .
well , i guess we can all agree that &apos;s not gonna happen .
there &apos;s nothing really left to say except ....
&quot; her name was lola .
she was a showgirl .
with yellow feathers , feathers in her hair , and a dress cut down to there .
she would ... &quot;
marenge , - ... &quot; marenge , thank you honey ,
and do the cha @-@ cha .
and while she like to be a star , tony always tended bar .
at the , wait , wait , everybody .. &quot;
okay , i &apos;ll do it .
you &apos;ll do what ?
if kids is what i takes to be with you then kids it is .
oh my god !
if i have to i &apos;ll , i &apos;ll do all again ,
i &apos;ll do the 4 o &apos;clock feeding thing ,
i &apos;ll go to the p.t.a. meetings ,
i &apos;ll coach the soccer team .
really ?
yeah , if i have to .
monica ,
i don &apos;t wanna lose you ,
so if i have to do it all over again , then i will .
you &apos;re the most wonderful man .
and if you hadn &apos;t of said &apos; if i have to &apos; like seventeen times ,
then i &apos;d be saying &apos; okay , let &apos;s do it.&apos;
but you &apos;re not .
oh my god , i can &apos;t believe what i &apos;m getting ready to say .
i wanna have a baby ,
but i don &apos;t wanna have one with someone who doesn &apos;t really wanna have one .
god .
i love you .
i know you do .
me too .
so what now ?
i guess we just
keep dancing .
where is she , where is she ?
oh , hey , i have a question , where is she ?
chandler , relax , chandler , she &apos;ll be here .
ooh , oh , oh , that &apos;s her .
yeah , &apos; cause life &apos;s just that kind .
chandler , you gotta stop staring at the door . it &apos;s like a watched pot ,
you know if you keep looking at it then the door is to , never gonna boil .
i think what you have to do is try not to ...
oh my god !
oh
my
god
oh
my
god
