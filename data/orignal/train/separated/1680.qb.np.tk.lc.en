i &apos;m telling you , if xenon emits ultraviolet light ,
then those dark matter discoveries must be wrong .
yes , well , if we lived in a world
where slow @-@ moving xenon produced light ,
then you &apos;d be correct .
also , pigs would fly ,
my derriere would produce cotton candy ,
and the phantom menace would be a timeless classic .
oh , you &apos;re so arrogant .
if you were a superhero ,
your name would be captain arrogant .
and you know what your superpower would be ?
arrogance .
you &apos;re wrong again .
if my superpower were arrogance ,
my name would be dr. arroganto .
i love watching raj and sheldon try to work together .
yeah , it &apos;s like if alien and predator decided
to go partners in a jamba juice .
has it occurred to you you &apos;re missing the big picture ?
if you look at neutron scattering data ...
oh , penny ?
penny ?
what &apos;s up ?
nothing . i just wanted to make raj stop talking .
no , no , no .
he won . suck it up .
well , i &apos;d ask you guys if you want dessert ,
but i know sheldon doesn &apos;t eat dessert on tuesdays .
and even if raj wanted something , he couldn &apos;t tell me .
howard won &apos;t order anything ,
but he will come up with some sort of skeevy comment
involving the words pie or cheesecake .
and leonard &apos;s lactose intolerant ,
so he can &apos;t eat anything here
without his intestines blowing up like a balloon animal .
hang on a second .
i could have the fruit platter .
you want the fruit platter ?
does it have melon on it ?
yeah .
no , i can &apos;t eat melon .
oh , howard , heads up .
your ex @-@ girlfriend just came in for her shift .
when was the last time you saw her ?
oh , not since we broke up .
wow . how am i going to play this ?
sophisticated and relaxed ?
friendly , noncommittal ?
cold and distant ?
hi , guys .
hello .
i see you decided to go with pathetic and frightened .
it &apos;s one of his best moves .
so , my dear , we meet again .
hello , howard .
i &apos;ve missed you .
i &apos;ve missed you , katee sackhoff .
one question .
anything .
why am i wearing my battlestar galactica flight suit in bed ?
why are you in bed with me ?
if we start to question this , it all falls apart .
sorry .
oh , ravish me , howard .
my loins ache for you .
okay , if you insist .
howard , have you seen my girdle ? !
no , ma !
i can &apos;t find it , and i &apos;m late for my weight watchers meeting !
maybe it committed suicide !
leave me alone !
now , where were we ?
i believe you were about
to rip off my uniform with your teeth .
bernadette ? !
what are you doing here ?
well , if i had to guess , i &apos;d say i &apos;m here
because you saw me earlier this evening ,
and you &apos;re still hung up on me .
no , i &apos;m not .
clearly you are .
otherwise , based on past experience ,
we &apos;d be done by now .
okay , i &apos;m a little confused here .
oh , my . can i help ?
not that kind of confused .
what &apos;s george takei doing here ?
howard , do you have latent homosexual tendencies ?
no , of course not .
so you say .
yet , here i am .
george , let me ask you something .
how did you deal with being typecast as a science fiction icon ?
it &apos;s difficult .
you try and stretch as an actor--
do strindberg , o &apos;neill ,
but all they want is , &quot; course laid in , captain . &quot;
tell me about it .
it &apos;s frackin &apos; frustrating .
wait . katee , why are you leaving ?
she &apos;s leaving because you really want to be with me .
howard , i found my girdle !
it was in the dryer !
great , ma !
i think it shrunk !
i &apos;m spilling out like the pillsbury doughboy here !
and with that mental picture ,
i think we &apos;re done for the evening .
you never told me what happened between you and bernadette .
i did a stupid thing .
yeah , i guessed that .
it was the kind of thing that makes it kind of hard to face her now .
that covers anything from farting in bed
to killing a homeless guy .
oh , my god .
you ran over a hobo .
no . stop asking .
all right , fine . so you want to get back together with her ,
but you &apos;re too ashamed to face her
because of whatever it is you did .
in a nutshell .
okay .
well , how about this ?
kidnap bernadette from the opera
wearing a creepy mask so she doesn &apos;t know it &apos;s you .
now , you see , i don &apos;t know if you &apos;re kidding or not .
you &apos;re being unreasonable .
why can &apos;t i have a desk ? !
our collaboration is a work of the mind .
we don &apos;t need desks .
you have a desk .
correct .
but i can &apos;t have one .
you &apos;re two for two .
why can &apos;t he have a desk , sheldon ?
oh , lord , will this day never end ?
as i &apos;ve explained repeatedly to dr. koothrappali ,
whose ability to comprehend the american idiom fails him
when it &apos;s convenient .
there &apos;s absolutely no money in my budget for additional office furniture .
oh , but there &apos;s money for a drawer full of red vines ,
a marshmallow shooting rifle ,
and a super executive ant farm with glow @-@ in @-@ the @-@ dark sand ?
yes .
okay , what if he buys his own desk ?
yeah , what if i buy my own desk ?
that &apos;s ridiculous .
why ?
because ...
yes ?
it &apos;s my office .
sheldon .
all right , all right .
he can buy his own desk .
and i can put it in your office ?
well , you really want to dot the i &apos;s and cross the t &apos;s , don &apos;t you ?
why would you want a glow @-@ in @-@ the @-@ dark ant farm ?
they do some of their best work at night .
ah , it &apos;s okay .
penny ?
penny ?
penny ?
penny ?
would you have opened the door if you knew it was me ?
not since i found out
the teddy bear you gave me had a webcam in it .
i just have a question .
does bernadette ever talk about me ?
oh , absolutely .
she does ?
yeah , sure .
just yesterday , she asked ,
&quot; why is howard hiding under the table ? &quot;
she saw that , huh ?
oh , no , not at first .
right after i pointed it out .
let me ask you something else .
is she seeing anybody ?
oh , not that i know of .
hey , while we &apos;re on the subject ,
why did you guys break up anyway ?
oh , i &apos;d rather not say .
howard , if you want my help , i &apos;ve got to know what happened .
but it &apos;s embarrassing ...
yeah , that &apos;s what i &apos;m counting on . spill .
okay . well , you know world of warcraft ?
um , the online game ? sure .
well , did you know
that the characters in the game can have sex with each other ?
oh , god . i think i see where this is going .
her name was glissinda the troll .
bernadette walked in on me
while we were doing the cyber @-@ nasty under the bridge of souls .
oh , you &apos;re right . that is so embarrassing .
would you talk to her ?
bernadette or the troll ?
bernadette . she was so mad at me ,
she wouldn &apos;t even listen to my side of the story .
well , what was your side ?
well , for all we know , glissinda the troll wasn &apos;t even a real woman .
i mean , she could &apos;ve been a 50 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver in new jersey .
really ? and that didn &apos;t make her feel better ?
will you talk to her , see if there &apos;s any chance at all
we could get back together ?
oh , gee , howard , i really don &apos;t want to get in the middle of this .
no . why would you ?
i &apos;m just another lonely nerd , living with his mother ,
trying to find any scrap of happiness he can .
you know , maybe to make up for
the fact that his dad left him when he was 11 .
okay , i will think about it .
you know , i &apos;ve always blamed myself
for him leaving .
i always thought it was because i wasn &apos;t the son he wanted .
yeah , i said i &apos;d think about it .
i wasn &apos;t athletic , yeah , i was kind of sickly ...
okay , fine . look , look , i &apos;m calling her now ! see ? !
thank you .
so anyway , howard asked penny to talk to bernadette ,
and she did ,
and bernadette agreed to meet him for a cup of coffee .
one question .
yeah ?
why on earth are you telling me all this ?
i don &apos;t know .
sometimes your movements are so lifelike ,
i forget you &apos;re not a real boy .
you said i could buy a desk .
this isn &apos;t a desk .
this is a ... brobdingnagian monstrosity .
is that the american idiom for &quot; giant , big @-@ ass desk &quot; ?
it &apos;s actually british .
can you say it again for me ?
brobdingnagian .
one more time ?
brobdingnagian .
now three times fast ?
brobdingnagian , brobdingna ...
how did you even get it in here ?
that &apos;s for me , ramon , julio , jesus and rodrigo to know
and you to find out .
all right , you &apos;ve made your point .
a fine prank , very amusing .
now get it out .
no .
yes .
no .
yes .
no .
yes !
i have three brothers and two sisters , sheldon--
i can do this all day .
all right , if you &apos;re not going to remove it ,
i &apos;ll remove it for you .
knock yourself out .
help me move my desk .
no .
yes .
no .
yes .
no . it &apos;s too brobdingnagian .
why do you even want this here ?
its size is completely disproportionate to its purpose .
well , seeing as its purpose was to piss you off ,
i &apos;d say it &apos;s spot @-@ on .
all right , i see what &apos;s going on .
this is the opening salvo in what will be
an escalating series of juvenile tit @-@ for @-@ tat exchanges .
well titted .
thank you .
stand by for my upcoming tat .
hey , sheldon ?
yes ?
no .
see what i did there ? i turned it around .
sorry , i had to clock out .
oh , no , that &apos;s okay .
how have you been ?
okay . you know , busy , school , work . you ?
same . i took a scuba @-@ diving course over the summer ,
but it turns out i &apos;m terrified of the ocean .
too bad .
you wouldn &apos;t know anybody
who wants to buy a wet suit , boy &apos;s large ?
yeah , forget it . not important .
so , are you seeing anyone ?
well , to be honest , i ...
hey , how are we doing over here ?
can i get you something to drink ?
not for me , thanks .
i &apos;m okay .
are you gonna want to order food ?
maybe later .
okay .
so , are you seeing anybody ?
no .
that &apos;s what i told him when he asked me .
i hope that &apos;s not out of line .
no , it &apos;s fine .
penny , can we have a little privacy ?
oh . i &apos;m sorry .
what about you , have you been seeing anybody ?
well , you know how it is with guys .
i mean , we have needs and ...
so you &apos;ve been seeing other girls ?
well , not real girls .
does that mean slutty trolls ?
you know , you look thirsty .
i brought you some iced tea .
thank you .
it &apos;s passion fruit , new on the menu .
i know . i work here .
oh , sorry .
yeah , you &apos;re right . doy .
so , howard , trolls yay or nay ?
isn &apos;t there somewhere else you can be ?
not where i can hear you guys .
okay , fine .
i &apos;ll admit , there are dark , sordid little corners of the internet
where the name wolowizard is whispered in hushed tones .
the only reason i go there ,
the only reason i &apos;ve ever gone there
is because i don &apos;t have a real woman in my life .
you happy ?
yeah , that &apos;ll hold me for a while .
howard , you did have a real woman .
i was right there in the next room
while you were clicking that troll &apos;s brains out .
yeah , but we weren &apos;t ...
i @-@ i mean , you and i never ...
had sex ?
yeah .
well , whose fault was that ?
complimentary nachos !
you enjoy .
never had sex ?
what do you mean , whose fault was that ?
well , we could &apos;ve been having sex ,
but you never made the move .
i didn &apos;t think you wanted me to make the move .
howard , a girl doesn &apos;t go out with a man like you ,
with your looks , your fancy patter and your tight hoochie pants
if she &apos;s not expecting him to eventually make the move .
really ?
really .
son of a bitch .
hey , this is a little awkward ,
but my manager says i can &apos;t actually give nachos away .
so ... just take that when you &apos;re ready .
yeah , we had a really great talk ,
and we &apos;re gonna start seeing each other again .
oh , congratulations .
have you broken it to the troll yet ?
did penny tell you about that ?
no . steve patterson told me .
the greasy old fat guy in facilities management ?
yeah .
how &apos;d he know about it ?
he &apos;s glissinda the troll .
sorry , dude , the thermostat &apos;s on my side of the room ,
so it stays mumbai hot in here
until you turn off that stupid indian music !
i &apos;ll turn off the music
when you get rid of that salmonella @-@ ridden parakeet !
oh , too bad ! sheldon &apos;s pathologically afraid of birds !
hey , look , sheldon ! birdie , birdie , birdie !
that &apos;s it ! prepare for marshmallow death !
eat flaming nerf !
so anyway ...
that &apos;s great news about you and bernadette .
yeah . i think i &apos;m gonna take her to miniature golf .
ah . i guess for you guys that &apos;s like regular golf .
short jokes ? really ?
you &apos;re , like , a quarter of an inch taller than me .
yeah , and don &apos;t you forget it .
i had a good time .
me , too .
kiss her good night .
all right , now a little tongue .
hold on there .
we &apos;ve only just rekindled the romance .
let &apos;s not sully the moment with the exchange of saliva .
don &apos;t listen to him .
she wants it .
tongue .
see ?
now make the move .
too soon .
trust me , she &apos;s ready .
make the move .
no , no , no .
a lady wants to be wooed , courted slowly .
how would you know ?
i read .
listen to me , howard , it &apos;s time .
make the move , now .
what are you doing ?
you said ... well , the &quot; move , &quot; remember ?
oh , not now .
we &apos;re starting a new relationship .
i need to get to know you again .
no , you don &apos;t .
it &apos;s me .
the lusty charmer with the fancy patter
and the hoochie pants .
be patient ; we &apos;ll get there .
told you .
oh , god , what &apos;s that smell ?
yes ?
what are you doing in there ?
i &apos;m making hydrogen sulfide and ammonia gas .
just a little experiment in pest control .
it &apos;s not gonna work , dude ; i grew up in india--
an entire subcontinent where cows walk in the street ,
and nobody has ever had a solid bowel movement .
well , we &apos;ll just see how long you can hold out .
well , we &apos;ll just see how your noxious gas
fares against my cinnamon @-@ apple @-@ scented aroma therapy candles .
didn &apos;t you say you &apos;re making hydrogen sulfide gas ?
yes .
isn &apos;t that flammable ?
highly .
oh , dear .
