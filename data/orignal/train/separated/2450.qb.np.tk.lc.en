luke is gone . he merged with kai . kai won .
i always win .
i would have done anything for you ,
and you chose death over me .
i never want to see you again .
bonnie needs magic to get out .
we just need to tell her where to find some .
damon , you &apos;re a genius .
caroline &apos;s mom isn &apos;t doing too hot .
caroline is meant to be extraordinary ,
and she needs to know how proud i am of her .
you tell her yourself .
when you told me you hated me .
i think we both know i never really hated you .
she &apos;s gone .
ok . i &apos;ve got band @-@ aids ,
surgical gear , and a medevac en route
for an air lift .
you &apos;re making fun of me .
no , sweetheart . i &apos;m making fun of me .
there is no greater first than watching
your kid ride without training wheels--
oh , boy--and no worst first
than seeing them bite the dust .
all right . there .
mommy ?
yes .
am i gonna die ?
i would say your chances of survival are 100 % .
are you gonna die ?
well ...
everyone dies eventually , sweetie ,
but not for a long , long time .
but what if you die and i &apos;m still here ?
well , then you &apos;ll be all grown up ,
and you won &apos;t need me .
i think i &apos;ll always need you .
sorry . just , um , water .
help yourself .
so what are you not writing ?
you believe your mother entrusted me to eulogize her ?
that &apos;s ... nice , i guess .
i think she &apos;s trying to teach me a lesson about my own mom .
was supposed to do the eulogy at her funeral ,
and i just--
we don &apos;t have to share .
right .
i just mean
today is pretty much gonna be the worst day of my life .
i &apos;m not sure that i need to start if off by bonding with you .
no offense .
none taken .
great .
thanks for the water .
hey , blondie .
today isn &apos;t the worst day of your life .
today and tomorrow , it &apos;s a cakewalk ,
and there will be people around you day in and day out
like they &apos;re afraid to leave you alone .
the worst day ?
that &apos;s next week
when there &apos;s nothing but quiet .
just a heads @-@ up .
appreciate the tip .
sure .
anytime .
you &apos;ve all asked what you can do to help .
there are 5 days worth of projects on here .
we are going to do them in one .
we can break the rules
and cut through the red tape .
i expect my mom to be properly celebrated
and buried by the end of the day .
sure , care . whatever you need .
elena , you &apos;re coming with me .
where are we going ?
casket shopping .
let &apos;s move !
you drive .
i sent my car to jeremy .
jeremy ! i forgot to put him on my list of people to call .
it &apos;s ok . i called him .
it &apos;s day 278
inside this stupid prison world .
i have two broken toes , 9 blisters ,
and an ear infection , but i don &apos;t care .
i have phesmatosed the crap out of this magic canadian rock ,
and i have my magic again ,
and when that eclipse hits 12 : 28 ...
i &apos;m going home .
you hear that , me .
home .
uh , you sure you don &apos;t want me
to hold your hair back or something ?
stay away from me .
this is gross .
we haven &apos;t been dating long enough for you to see gross .
i have guilt .
the vegan dish i made fun of did you in .
i &apos;m dying .
stupid thai food . never again .
you know , maybe we should just skip the funeral .
we &apos;re going .
wait , wait , wait , wait .
look . i know you hate me ,
but i really ... really need to see my sister .
i think she &apos;ll pass .
what are you doing here ?
i called to tell you i was sick ,
and you--you hung up on me .
because i have food poisoning .
did the sound of me vomiting
on the other end of the line not clue you in ?
there &apos;s an issue that i &apos;ve been worried about
since the merge because we didn &apos;t really do it right ,
you know , the whole &quot; you &apos;re not my twin .
&quot; hey . that &apos;s ok . close enough &quot; plan ?
it worked , which is , you know , cool .
hey . i &apos;m even a little bit nice now
in case you were wondering ,
but i &apos;ve been waiting for the other shoe to drop ,
and , well , i think it &apos;s dropped
because i &apos;m--
where &apos;s the bathroom ?
oh , god !
oh , god !
ric .
here .
i don &apos;t think you have food poisoning .
i was supposed to merge my magic with you ,
but i got luke &apos;s instead .
now i &apos;m defective ,
and i think that &apos;s why you &apos;re sick .
i kind of feel like i &apos;m dying actually ,
and if i die , so do you ,
dad , liv , and the rest of our dumb coven .
so would you please fix me , like , now ?
what are you doing ?
borrowing one of father &apos;s ties for the funeral .
he will skin you alive .
take mine .
ok .
did you finish the speech ?
not quite .
it &apos;s an important speech .
i will finish it , stefan .
father said we &apos;re not to cry .
that is because father is incapable of human emotion .
you are 10 .
you can cry if you feel like it .
i don &apos;t think i will .
why &apos;s that ?
because mother &apos;s angel told me everything would be all right .
when was this ?
last night in my sleep .
she visited me .
did she visit you ?
i must have missed it .
there . be on your way .
well , i see the eulogy is coming along swimmingly .
it &apos;s percolating .
listen . i need your advice ,
and i need you to not be a dick about it
because i have no one else to ask .
oh , this sounds promising .
what did i just say ?
all right . look .
something happened between caroline and me .
finally .
and then here mom died , and i haven &apos;t had a chance
to talk to her about it ,
and i don &apos;t know the best way to handle it .
pull the ripcord .
what ?
well , she &apos;s not the one .
if she was , you wouldn &apos;t have to ask .
yeah , but i didn &apos;t even--
you &apos;ve been in love twice in your life , stefan .
setting aside that it was technically the same face ,
does this feel like that ?
not all love is true love , brother .
caroline wants the real deal ,
and if you don &apos;t , pull the ripcord
before you make things worse .
just not today .
let her have today .
your mother was such a vibrant woman ,
even after your father ran off with that man .
thank you , mrs. mcgruder .
i &apos;m sure we &apos;ll see you at the funeral .
well , welcome to the world of awkward sympathies .
that &apos;s why you have to be prepared with your responses .
i recommend at least 3 .
i don &apos;t know you survived this .
the responses will be different
for each category of people in your life--
friends of circumstance , casual acquaintances , loved ones .
i kissed stefan .
i want to talk to him about it ,
but if it &apos;s bad , i feel like he won &apos;t be honest ,
you know , not today .
then talk to him about it tomorrow .
you already have a lot on your plate .
i think i need to know today .
we &apos;re behind schedule . let &apos;s go .
any joint pain ?
headaches ?
yup .
are you pregnant ?
stop making jokes .
i feel like i &apos;m being scrunched from inside out .
this is kind of private .
does your baby @-@ boo i feel like i &apos;m being scrunched need to be here ?
i &apos;m not leaving her alone with you ,
so deal with it .
ok . your vitals are fine , your temperature is normal .
i &apos;ll wait on pathology , but there &apos;s nothing medically wrong with you .
yeah , duh , because i &apos;m magically diseased .
you haven &apos;t puked in at least--
i feel better .
yeah because you juice @-@ boxed my magic .
yeah . sorry about that . that was an accident ,
but i--wow !
i legitimately feel better .
you need to give me your magic .
what ?
this faux merge is clearly failing
because i was supposed to get your magic , right ?
just--i don &apos;t know-- put it in a-- put it in a teddy bear
or a bed pan or whatever and give me .
listen .
i could just as easily break 7 little bones
in your hand with one good squeeze , ok ?
i can see you &apos;re skeptical , ric .
can i call you ric ?
hey , buddy , but here &apos;s the thing you need to know
is that jo only survives if i do , ok ,
and if that &apos;s not enough for you ,
you know , the power that binds prison worlds
comes from the leader of the gemini coven .
if i die , the worlds collapse , all right ?
i see vacancy .
would you like me to start over with single syllables ?
did you say prison worlds ,
as in more than one ?
has no one ever mentioned that ?
this is it .
i &apos;m ready .
there &apos;s no one to stop me .
i have magic and the ascendant
and the eclipse .
no .
no .
i &apos;m worried about caroline .
i don &apos;t think she &apos;s handling this as well as she thinks she is .
you &apos;re not done yet ?
no , i &apos;m not done ,
and i will never be done .
i am not a nice person ,
and i should not have to stand in front of the whole town
and pretend to be a nice person .
this is liz having a last laugh from the great beyond .
easy .
you are nice ...
ish .
not helping .
this isn &apos;t about you , damon .
this isn &apos;t even about liz .
it &apos;s about caroline
and what she needs to hear .
ok ?
you missed your speech .
i know .
why ?
i could not decide what to say .
you could have just said good @-@ bye .
i don &apos;t really have a choice .
of course you have a choice .
it &apos;s your magic to give or not give .
what do you think i should do ?
look . my life is full of martyrs
who cave to the bad guy , trying to be heroes ,
and it never ends well .
somebody inevitably gets hurt or dead ,
and that somebody could just as easily be you or bonnie regardless ,
no matter what you do .
so if you want to fight and keep your magic ,
i will fight with you ,
and if not ,
well , then ...
i loved you when you weren &apos;t a witch ,
and i &apos;m pretty sure
i will still love you regardless .
pretty sure ?
yeah , at least 92 % .
caroline .
doing all right ?
yeah . fine .
all things ... considered .
sure you &apos;re doing ok ?
yeah .
no .
i don &apos;t know .
just now , i was supposed to put you into a category
so i would know what to say to you ,
but then i realized i didn &apos;t know
what category you would want to be put in ,
so , uh , i was thinking , &quot; i guess there &apos;s no time
like the horribly inappropriate present
to get to the bottom of that . &quot;
i could list the categories if you like .
caroline , i , um ...
i @-@ i want to talk to you about all this ,
i do , but ...
maybe when we &apos;re alone after you &apos;ve had
a chance to get through the day .
yeah , god . of course .
um , this is not the time .
i &apos;m so sorry .
don &apos;t be sorry .
we &apos;ll talk when all of this is over .
care .
they &apos;re ready .
do you need a minute ?
no . i &apos;m ok .
i &apos;m gonna be all right , mom , i promise .
everything will be fine after today .
i &apos;m ready .
ok . clearly , i &apos;ve been dropped
into a snowy tundra hell dimension .
either that , or i finally had a psychotic break .
incendia .
there you are you &apos;re late .
yeah .
olivia used to say she hated all my ties ,
so i had to find a new one .
are you drunk ?
that depends .
how many days in a row can someone drink
before they &apos;re just normal ?
you &apos;re not going in there .
back off , man .
it &apos;s caroline &apos;s mom .
i &apos;m not missing her funeral .
i &apos;m sorry about you and liv .
i know you &apos;ve been going through a lot of crap ,
but caroline does not deserve you bringing it here .
we are here today to pay our tribute
and our respect
to a pillar of our community ,
our sister ,
our protector
sheriff elizabeth forbes .
we are also here today
to show our love and support
for liz &apos;s family and friends .
calling sheriff forbes .
this is the last call for sheriff forbes .
no response .
radio number 2 @-@ 6 is out of service
after 12 years and 4 months of police service .
gone but never forgotten .
ten @-@ hut .
liz forbes was my friend .
in her last moments , she asked me to pass along
a message to her daughter ,
but i cut her off before she could say too much ,
told her she could tell caroline herself ,
but she didn &apos;t get that chance .
your mom wanted you to know how proud of you she was ,
and she should be .
you &apos;re a beautiful , strong woman ,
a generous friend ,
and a bright light in a sea of dark .
she said you were extraordinary ,
and you are ,
and so was she .
liz was a hero to this town ,
she was a hero to all of you ,
and she was a hero to me .
good @-@ bye , sheriff .
you will be missed .
thank you all for coming .
this is for my mom .
* go in peace *
* go in kindness *
* go in love *
* go in faith *
* leave the day *
* the day behind us *
* the day is done *
* go in grace *
* let us go into the dark *
* not afraid *
* not alone *
* let us hope by some good pleasure *
* safely to *
* arrive at home *
thank you so much .
i &apos;m sober .
don &apos;t ask me to leave .
i &apos;m not . i &apos;m glad you pulled it together .
the thing is , ty , i get it , all right ?
we &apos;ve all been through so much
that it &apos;s bound to make us a little crazy .
i was thinking ,
you know , watching the way all those cops honored her today ,
i want to be a part of something like that ,
so i talked to one of the deputies ,
and he gave me an application .
there &apos;s this , uh , officer training program .
seems pretty cool , you know , like something
i &apos;m supposed to be a part of .
i got one for you , too .
hey . are you leaving ?
yeah . i think i &apos;ve done the whole funeral thing enough for one day .
i &apos;ll walk you home .
no . it &apos;s two blocks .
i &apos;ll be fine , elena .
i just don &apos;t think it &apos;s a good idea
for you to be alone tonight , you know ?
i think that &apos;s exactly what i need actually .
thank you for everything you did today , elena .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
you &apos;re welcome , but--
i &apos;ll be fine , elena , ok ?
i just had to get through today .
oh , my god .
let &apos;s do this .
ahh . me , our coven , and the prison worlds thank you .
what exactly is this other prison world ?
a place filled with crappy people like me , i &apos;m sure .
congrats .
you &apos;re saving their miserable lives from oblivion .
don &apos;t look so stressed .
you never liked being a witch anyway .
shut up .
oh , god .
i can do this .
blue lights , the eclipse ,
they &apos;re both recurring events .
i can get out of here .
come on .
come on .
who are you ?
who are you ?
it &apos;s done .
thank you .
and congratulations .
have a good life , sissie .
what did he say ?
the reason i was sick ,
it wasn &apos;t food poisoning .
what was it ?
he said i &apos;m pregnant .
i don &apos;t know what to say . i don &apos;t -- hmm .
i don &apos;t know what to do with that .
marry me .
what ? !
no , no .
that &apos;s a pity proposal .
you can &apos;t throw a pity proposal at a pregnant ex @-@ witch .
i don &apos;t even know if i want kids ,
let alone get married .
oh , my god . what are you doing ?
i bought this the day after your brother died .
caroline &apos;s mother was sick , and you were in danger ,
and i just thought life &apos;s too short ,
and i &apos;ve been trying to plan for the right moment ,
which was supposed to be this morning with breakfast in bed ,
you know , until you started puking up last night &apos;s dinner .
ric .
we can talk about choices and all that .
we can ...
but i would really love to have this baby with you .
that &apos;s , uh ,
that &apos;s something i never thought i &apos;d have .
so this isn &apos;t a pity proposal , jo .
i love you .
marry me .
i can &apos;t believe this .
are you sure ?
at least 92 % .
yes .
yes .
yes .
nice speech .
thanks .
what broke through the writer &apos;s block ?
i just needed to be reminded that the good @-@ bye wasn &apos;t about me .
i failed you by not doing the eulogy at our mother &apos;s funeral .
i didn &apos;t want to fail anyone today .
i think you were wrong
about caroline .
i realized that i may not be able to explain
what i feel for her ,
but it is something ,
and , yeah , maybe all love isn &apos;t true love
in the messed up way that you and i have experienced it , but ...
i think this could turn into something even better .
well , then , brother , stop wasting your time sitting here with me .
i think she could use a piece of news like that today .
i said i was fine , elena .
i don &apos;t believe you .
all day , something has been bugging me .
you wanted to pack this all in so quickly
like you had somewhere you needed to be .
i mean , you were so concerned with getting through today
without a hint of how you &apos;d feel tomorrow ,
and then i realized .
you don &apos;t want to feel tomorrow .
that &apos;s the plan , right ?
you &apos;re not going to feel tomorrow
because you &apos;re gonna turn it all off .
i thought i could get through the rough patch
and then just pick myself up after like i usually do ,
but then damon made me realize
it &apos;s just gonna get worse .
you &apos;re listening to damon ?
i can &apos;t do worse , elena , ok ?
i didn &apos;t even think that there was a worse .
it &apos;s better this way .
better ? care ,
you &apos;re talking about flipping the humanity switch .
there &apos;s nothing better about that .
that is your experience , ok ?
i have more control over my vampire self than you ever did .
my experience will be different .
it &apos;s not gonna be different , care .
it &apos;s gonna be deadly .
you saw what happened to me when i did it .
yeah , that &apos;s my point , elena .
you did it .
you couldn &apos;t handle the pain when your brother died ,
so you turned it off .
damon died , and you erased all your memories .
stefan moved to savannah
and became an auto mechanic .
what , do you think that you guys are the only ones
who get to escape grief ?
you just mentioned two of the biggest mistakes
that i ever made .
were they mistakes ?
because when you came out the other end ,
the worst part of the pain was gone ,
and that &apos;s what i need .
i just need the pain to be gone .
and if stefan had said the right thing earlier ,
would that have changed your mind ?
yeah . i heard .
well , he didn &apos;t , so it doesn &apos;t really matter .
my mom is dead , elena .
i--it hurts so bad , i can &apos;t breathe ,
i can &apos;t--i can &apos;t do worse , i can &apos;t , ok ?
i shouldn &apos;t have to .
no one should have to .
it &apos;s not fair .
it &apos;s not . i get it . i do .
and i know that you think that you have it all figured out ,
but please listen to me .
i &apos;m not gonna let you do this .
that &apos;s not your choice to make .
where &apos;d you go , elena ? call me back .
bonnie ?
one and only .
oh , you made it !
caroline ?
sorry to barge in . door was unlocked .
caroline ?
caroline ?
i don &apos;t get it .
so you are in my house in the 1903 prison world .
watch this .
i didn &apos;t know what &apos;s going on till i pulled it out .
congratulations .
you shot some walls .
just wait .
who are you ?
who are you ?
what it is ?
there , stop .
oh my god .
what ?
