第二十七季 第二十一集
Yeah, I know Ralphie's birthday is coming up.
Of course I'm gonna get him a present.
I'm at the... the toy store right now.
Let's see, present for Ralph,
present for Ralph...
Ooh, what do we have here?
Boy, Ralph would kill himself with this in two seconds.
And somehow it'd be my fault.
This money has been sitting here since 1998,
not doing anybody any good.
I want to get Ralphie something nice.
Yeah, a few thousand should do.
Uh, you heard me whistling there, right?
That indicates innocence.
Uh, proclaiming your innocence indicates guilt.
Uh, yeah? Well, what does this mean?
Okay, so, at a Ralph party, always get to the cake before...
Too late.
That's the best damn treehouse I've ever seen!
Fine. I'll rub my eyes the other way.
The September issue!
Free wood!
My treehouse sucks.
You have class envy!
Nelson, honey,
I told you to stop sayin' "Haw-haw."
Give me a dollar and I'll stop.
I don't got a dollar.
Do you want to practice your speech on me?
No need, honey.
Same speech I give every year.
The opening joke about Lenny's grandma always kills.
You can't joke about her--
They just put her on life support.
What?! No! She's the linchpin!
It's okay, it's okay.
Everyone is terrified of public speaking.
But just in case,
I'll defrost a failure ham.
You don't have faith in me! I have savers.
If I get heckled, I'll say, "Get a half-life!"
I'm sure that'll be funny to them.
Calm down, Homer.
Just leave your body.
Oh, no!
What the hell is this?!
Ooh, throwing away your "No girls" sign?
Is it time for you to have "The talk" with your dad?
Because he's gonna have to read a few things first.
No. I'm tearing it down.
Ralph has a cool treehouse, and mine sucks.
Well, Bart, your father built it,
and he did the very best he could.
I did my job. Now it's your turn, tree.
Get growing.
I'll tell you what, why don't I spruce it up for you. Huh?
But you're an inside grown-up.
Moms can't build treehouses.
You realize that saying that
is gonna make this mom work her keister off
to make you the best darn treehouse you ever saw!
Sounds good.
Don't worry.
You forget, most of that's hair.
So I said,
"Get a half-life!"
Funny and handsome.
And I hear he's loaded.
Yes.
Now, to end this perfect day on the perfect note,
Mr. Homer Simpson.
You're gonna do great, Homer. You're gonna kill.
You're gonna-- oh, where did all these people come from?!
Webster's dictionary defines... a speech
as a... series of words that...
elo... quently...
I've never seen anyone bomb like that.
Yeah. I really feel badly for the guy.
I'm a failure.
Shall I release the hounds, sir?
Mm, the therapy hounds.
Oh, oh, I feel a little better.
Now release the real hounds.
It's a pretty good seminar this year.
Dad, what's wrong? Did your speech go badly?
How do you know something's wrong?
You're drinking from a can of corn.
我们天堂见
Aw, dad, do you know Barbra Streisand
once forgot the words to a song
and didn't perform in public again for nearly three decades?
Yeah, but she still had James Brolin to cuddle.
So, on a scale of ten to ten, how'd you do?
Drip drop, you flop.
Drip drop, you flop.
Drip drop, you flop.
Drip drop, you flop.
Fail, fail, fail, fail...
Drip drop, you flop.
Fail, fail, fail, fail...
What the hell is your problem, idiot!
I don't know!
I don't know!
I know what will cheer you up.
We'll go to the comedy club downtown.
Downtown? With all those desperate addicts?
Oh, the city cleaned them up and made them comics.
Cool!
Homie, you're gonna chuckle your blues away.
This is the best kind of comedy.
No writers.
Amen to that, Marge.
And I appreciate this,
but I really resent the two-drink minimum!
You always drink more than two drinks.
But no one makes me.
Three long island iced teas, please.
Okay, we're gonna perform a little improv.
First we need a location.
Uh, 40.7 degrees north latitude,
74 degrees west longitude.
Ah, yes, New York City. Now we need a relationship
for me and Cathy here.
Loveless marriage!
Okay, I heard loveless marriage.
These guys are pros.
All they did was ask for two premises.
That's two more than you've asked for.
Oh, boy.
All right, all we need now is an object.
Anyone.
Fear of public speaking
Sorry, didn't hear that.
Oh... Fear of public speaking.
Maybe he has trouble talking in the dark.
Hey, Jerry, bring up number seven.
No! Jerry, no!
No!
Jerry, stop it! No! Don't...
Oh, no!
Okay, okay, okay, um... Fear of public speaking.
Well, that's not really an object,
but we'll make it work.
New York City, loveless marriage,
fear of public speaking.
They've pulled back the bow-- now let the arrow take flight.
You know, I'm gonna move over a seat.
We now take you to an apartment
on 68th and Columbus avenue.
What? What? Cathy, what's wrong?
I-I... I-I...
I...
Aw, for heaven's sakes, Cathy, when we got married,
you used to speak for hours.
But since we moved to New York City, nothing!
Wow. It all magically fits.
Come on, Cathy, say something! Anything!
Fuggedaboutit!
And scene!
I said "Fear of public speaking."
Yes, you did. Very nice. Return to your seat immediately.
Wow. Wow. These guys do everything I can't.
Maybe they can teach me.
I don't know that they're interested in that.
$500 for the first eight classes.
That's kind of expensive.
Couldn't people just form their own groups for free?
And scene.
即兴表演课
Excuse me, is this the, uh,
improv class?
Yes, and... Come in.
Sit anywhere?
Yes, and... be quiet.
This is it.
I feel my mind exploding with premises.
So many ideas,
but how do I turn them into comedy?
Homer, could-could you stay with us, please?
I don't know how.
The secret is to lose yourself
And become, say, a suicidal auctioneer.
I could not possibly imagine what such a person would say.
Well, just remember, it's-it's not you.
Don't you get it? The secret to life
has been right in front of you.
Don't be yourself!
Uh, uh, okay.
What am I bid for this noose?
Do I hear $100?
No?
Going... Going...
That's great! Really took my mind off my sick grandmother.
Looks like the hospital left a message.
Gotta go.
See ya!
It made me laugh.
So, then, you pay me?
No, never!
And if you open your own school, we'll break your legs!
You want to give him the one we can never crack?
Queen of Norway buying a car.
Oh, dear! I can't a-fjord it!
A star is born.
Excuse me.
I'm from the city. Are you aware that you live
in a historical treehouse preservation district?
May I see your permits?
I don't have permits.
Don't worry.
D-don't worry.
I'll take care of it.
明日安排:蟑螂检查 照常营业
I've got to hand it to you, dad.
You went from fear of public speaking
to starting your own improv troupe.
Improv is exciting,
but totally safe.
Like driving a helicopter on the ground.
Um, that's not safe.
Don't deny the premise.
That's anti-improv.
Note for new character, "Auntie improv."
May I hear a suggestion?
People, don't freak out,
but the improv critic from the Springfield Shopper
is in the audience.
Steve Thurlson?
No, Thurlson is their improv reporter.
Grant Hood is their improv critic.
Then who's Jennifer Whitehead?
Oh, she writes improv think pieces.
You know, trends, big picture stuff.
Who does the top ten list
at end-of-year "Best of improv" issue?
They each write their own.
Oh, yeah.
I forgot about that. That's true.
Hi, everybody.
We are "premises, premises."
Yes, it says on google that there are 5,012 improv groups
with that name.
Take it, Homer.
Uh, okay, I need a location.
Uh, Jackson Square in New Orleans.
And a type of person that might be there.
Someone with confidence.
Mm, I...
I ga-ron-tee it!
So, Tuesday is the treehouse warming.
Nelson's gonna show us his mom's bra.
That's the thing that boobs touch.
Whoa, automatic blinds.
Yeah, I think my mom put those in.
No need to thank her.
She's just doing her job.
The keebler elves are real!
Pass the gravy, Bart.
Yo.
Thank you.
Geez, who ordered the crab?
There's crab?
There's no crab.
There's no "thank you's," no appreciation.
Nothing.
Uh, who was that directed at?
Bart!
Pass the gravy, please.
Dad! Dad!
The Springfield Fringe Festival just invited us to perform.
Huh? What's a "Fringe Festival"?
My guess would be it's a three-day series of performances
by alternative comedy and music acts,
including, but not limited to,
improv, stand-up, light circus work and ironic burlesque.
We're gonna be on the main stage on closing night!
This is going in my log.
Yay!
More crab for me.
There's no crab!
Aw, Marge, don't take it to heart.
Kids are ungrateful, that's their job.
You can cheer up watching me at the Fringe Festival.
Good for you.
The main stage, closing night, all eyes on you.
Wh-wh-wh-what... What are you saying?
Oh, she's making me nervous again.
But now I'm a trained comedy amateur.
No one can get in my head.
Marge simpson,
You don't want to accidentally undermine him like last time.
Oh, thank god he doesn't know what I'm thinking.
I know exactly what she's thinking.
That if I mess this up, I'll be worse off than ever.
He does know.
She knows I know!
Homer?
Aw, what?
焦急的苗浩斯正在等待
I slept on it, and I'm madder than ever.
Go get Bart.
Oh my god, Marge,
You woke up with morning-would-be-mad.
Okay, I'll put this in your new language.
Location, Bart's room.
Action, bring him here.
Can I get a character, please?
Fine.
A near-sighted Frankenstein.
Okay.
Bride! Bride!
I do not look like the bride of Frankenstein.
Don't deny premise.
Mom, can I come in?
You like your eggs a little runny don't you?
What?
And your toast set at four, with a little bit of butter?
Yeah!
Hash browns might be a little burnt.
I like 'em however you make 'em, sweetie.
I just wanted to say
I'm sorry.
We all forget just how many wonderful things you do.
Y-you're making me cry.
and best of all,
You're as hot as the day I met you.
Thank you!
That apology speech you wrote worked like a charm, Pop.
Your mother can't resist an apology
that comes straight from the heart...
of this box.
艺穗节
Oh, dear god,
This is not a renaissance faire, is it?
Uh, that's in two weeks,
Henry the weight problem.
Gee, I don't know if I belong here with all this talent.
Hey, reverend.
Why didn't the dinosaurs make it on Noah's ark?
Ooh, I give up.
Because they didn't exist.
Dad, this festival encourages experimentation.
Even failure.
Oh, what if I don't fail?
Desperate times call for desperate measures.
I am getting a helium balloon.
That makes anyone funny.
Be right back!
Homer, are you okay?
You look exactly like Barbara Streisand did in 1967.
I can't think of anything funny.
Homer, homer, relax, you're a riot.
Remember how funny you was when you was the confident cajun?
Look, just let me feed you the prompt.
Wait, you mean cheat at improv?
What would Del Close say?
He would say, "Do like Moe says, and shut the hell up."
Who's Del Close?
Only the author of the best book I intend to read someday.
Homer, the cemeteries are filled with people
Who didn't cheat at improv.
Okay, let's go over what you're gonna call out one more time.
Ethnicity, Cajun.
Location, Back Alley.
Good, good.
The back alley cajun bit.
Dad!
Are you cheating by planting suggestions?
Maybe.
Have you learned nothing from owning an unread copy
of Truth In Comedy?
It's either that or quit the show.
You can't let your troupe down.
They need your space work,
your strong choices,
And scene-building skills.
Hey, lay off your dad, huh?
Everything that's supposedly spontaneous
Has already been planned, okay?
Reality shows, uh, lip-sync singing, even...
awards shows.
No!
Yes, that's why the losers don't show up.
B-b-b-but they have scheduling conflicts.
Yeah, right.
Dave Franco has a scheduling conflict.
No, no, I've heard enough.
I refuse to use performance enhancing "Sugs."
It's Homer Simpson.
Homer simpson's here.
Okay, everyone, I'm Homer Simpson
and I need an occupation.
Cadaver salesman?
Drive-thru cashier.
Uh, frog gigger.
Finger kisser!
Nurse.
You'll have to be more specific.
I need a nurse!
Back alley Cajun!
A father I can look up to.
I hear... Drive-thru cashier!
You wha...?
Hello, welcome to "Down and out burger"
Would you like fries with that?
A thousand?
Sure thing, Mr. Brando.
By the way, this is 1992.
And now we're going to do something a little special.
Our father is going to improve live answers to questions
from the TV audience.
It only took us 27 years to do
what they could do in 1954.
Homer, time to bomb.
秘密地下地堡
Hello!
I've gathered you here because I have an important announcement.
[福克斯政治评论节目主持人]
This is the last episode of "The simpsons."
It's been a great run.
Just kidding.
"The simpsons" will never end.
Now I've told you two lies,
and to prove there were live
On Saturday night live last night, Drake was terrible.
Now to take your calls.
Let's go to Hannah.
Hannah, you're talking to Homer.
Hi there, Homer. My question for you is
who do do you like more --
Lenny or Carl -- and why?
Let's see.
I like Lenny because he's the black guy and
wait a minute, no.
Carl's the -- Wait. Let me get back to you
when I figure out who's who.
Let's go to the next question.
Amanda?
I was wondering if you could give me any tips or tricks
for making it look like I'm hard at work
but really I'm relaxing or taking a nap
Always wear glasses with eyes
glued onto them.
Next question.
George, I think.
Hello, George.
Hello, Homer.
What's your question?
So my question is pizza-related.
Do you prefer chicago deep dish or New York-style?
Let's see. I prefer chicago deep dish
because I like Italian better than Chinese.
And now let's go to a planted call
with a planted question.
Let's go to -- hello?
Homer, how are you doing?
I'm doing all right. Is that your question?
I was wondering what kind of car do you drive?
Oh, I drive a hybrid which is a combination of old and terrible.
Next caller.
Chris. Yes, chris. What's your question?
马上回来
Or comment.
My question is what's your favorite job?
What was your favorite job?
My favorite job would have been being an astronaut
because everything was done for me.
And also I could get away from boy.
Well, that's it.
That's it, ladies and gentlemen.
We have come to my closing remarks.
It only lasted three minutes,
like eating cheeseburgers and making love.
If your call hasn't been taken yet,
please continue to hold.
The cast of "Empire" Will be answering questions Wednesday night.
Someone will let them know.
Flashing by are the credits of people
who worked long and hard on this.
I have no idea who they are.
Now the show is over.
The spotlight dims, the laughter fades. Someone call uber.
If Bart would just return my pants
so I can move from behind this desk.
Wait on the pants.
Oh, Bart. Not culottes. No...
