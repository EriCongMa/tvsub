第五季第八集
this is no longer a dream . this is reality .
three months from now , we are opening offices in new york .
i want to say something .
not now , howard .
we are growing .
share that with your clients .
the era of constriction is over .
now , a new era
needs new branding .
&quot; l.g. &quot;
own those letters .
no one says &quot; lockhart / gardner &quot; anymore .
it &apos;s &quot; l.g. &quot;
i &apos;ll be right back .
who &apos;s thinking of leaving ?
sonya rucker . the wabash fund .
chumhum ?
no . not yet .
sonya rucker and wabash are leaving florrick @-@ agos .
their infrastructure ?
bad .
florrick @-@ agos barely exists . we &apos;ve been working out of
alicia &apos;s apartment for the last two weeks .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m back here .
did the clients know ?
no .
we either met at their offices or over lunch .
but they are moving into new offices today .
what offices ? t @-@ shirt factory on grand .
really ?
it &apos;s all we could ...
they could afford .
$ 20 a square foot .
the connections with the governor aren &apos;t helping alicia ?
mm , they &apos;re hurting her .
i lost a client because of all the ethical issues
from the governor &apos;s office .
thank you , anthony .
what a putz .
we should &apos;ve tried to get carey zepps .
i &apos;ll take rucker .
will , you take the wabash .
i &apos;ll be right back .
how &apos;s your course going ?
when driving in fog , you should use your ... ?
low beams .
that &apos;s not true , is it ?
it is .
i wrote fog lights .
why are they called fog lights if they &apos;re not for fog ?
to trick you .
how long do you need my wi @-@ fi for ?
a few hours .
want me gone ?
nope . stay as long as you want .
so , do we have a yoko ono problem here ?
mr. lee , she &apos;s still waiting .
tell her to come back tomorrow . tell her ...
all the partners are busy .
i &apos;m not busy . who is it ?
a walk @-@ in . not much money .
she says she used to work here .
i &apos;ll take care of it .
so , uh ,
you used to work here , ms. flores ?
i did . two years ago . as an intern .
now you want to come back ?
no .
that was a joke .
breaking the ice .
so ... how can we help you ?
a friend of mine has been swept up in a raid of businesses
employing undocumented workers .
they &apos;ve threatened to deport him back to mexico
unless he agrees to a snitch visa ...
oh , so you &apos;re from mexico ?
no .
i love mexico .
i was down there in the &apos; 60s .
puerto vallarta .
god , the drinks they had .
you know , the ones . the @-@ the , um ...
the ones , um ...
what are they called ?
i have no idea .
and the women .
in those dresses .
those short dresses .
could you call alicia florrick for me , please ?
a @-@ actually , alicia doesn &apos;t work here anymore .
she doesn &apos;t ?
where is she ?
well , here it is .
the furniture should be arriving in a few hours .
do we have phones , at least ?
not until tomorrow .
we &apos;ll have to work from cells .
we can &apos;t meet with chumhum here .
eh , we need to polish the floors .
you know , make it look like a hip start @-@ up .
open floor plan . no walls .
it &apos;ll take us a week .
we can do this .
and when did this happen ?
well , right now . the prosecutor &apos;s mid @-@ trial
and he &apos;s pressuring tomas
to sign the snitch visa before noon .
i told tomas to wait till he spoke to a lawyer .
that &apos;s your friend ? tomas ?
yes . tomas ruiz .
i knew him in school .
and who does this prosecutor want him to testify against ?
lalo hierra .
yes , i know .
it &apos;s worrisome .
okay , let me talk to my partners .
we &apos;re just ... starting out .
yes , i can see that .
are these just temporary ?
they &apos;re gonna look great .
just give us a week .
it &apos;s just consultation on a visa , but she needs me now .
is it worth our time ?
i &apos;m not sure this guy can pay .
he &apos;s an undocumented immigrant . he owns a body shop .
well , we can &apos;t be doing pro bono .
no , no , no . we should do it .
why ?
natalie flores works for a new york lobbyist named joe pallotta .
he controls $ 90 million in client billing .
he can direct chicago work our way .
checked online .
okay . i &apos;ll take it .
hey , our first new client .
all right . yes .
who was the last person hired , the last salaried person ?
why ?
i was talking to clarke hayden .
we need to , uh , make cuts to our payroll .
carey , we made a commitment to our employees .
yes ,
and that commitment means nothing if we go under .
who was the last person ?
ah . it was robyn , wasn &apos;t it ?
we can &apos;t let her go . we &apos;ll have no investigator .
and how much have we investigated in the last two weeks ?
look , it &apos;s just for a few months . i &apos;ll talk to her .
no , i will .
but not until friday .
i need your answer now , mr. ruiz .
i &apos;ve been in this country for nine years , sir .
our shop pays social security and payroll tax .
yes , and you &apos;re undocumented .
look , it &apos;s very simple .
lalo hierra used your shop
to meet with the head of the latin gangsters .
you testify to that fact and what you heard them say ,
and you won &apos;t be deported .
excuse me . could you step outside ?
could i ... who are you ?
alicia florrick , mr. ruiz &apos;s attorney .
who are you ?
mr. ruiz ,
it is your right to have an attorney present , but i must warn you ...
if you want to warn anyone , warn me .
... any delay in signing this snitch visa
means the offer could go away .
the offer &apos;s not going away .
you need him more than he needs you .
now , whom am i addressing ?
karl dolan . u.s. attorney .
she &apos;s gonna get you deported , tomas ...
please step outside , ausa dolan . right now .
no , that &apos;s it .
i &apos;m conferring with my client .
step outside .
tomas , elena ,
this is one of the lawyers i was talking to you about .
alicia florrick .
i &apos;d like you to consider all the possibilities before you sign .
i know . lalo is dangerous and i &apos;ll be testifying against him ,
but ... i ...
can &apos;t be without elena .
i can &apos;t be deported .
that will truly kill me .
he &apos;ll do it .
praise god .
but he wants 24 @-@ hour protection for his family and himself .
that &apos;s already in the visa .
no , it was promised , but it &apos;s not in the visa .
also , he wants a promise not to deport his wife and his girls .
you didn &apos;t need to come .
i would &apos;ve offered all that .
good . so put it in the visa ,
and we &apos;ll be ready for court .
six bodies were found hanging from a bridge outside the city .
five more were decapitated .
and did anyone
take responsibility for the execution ?
there was a bullet left at the scene ,
a single .357 magnum shell
with the letters &quot; l.c. &quot; painted on it .
&quot; l.c. &quot; ?
short for &quot; el culebra . &quot;
the snake .
and is there someone in the cartel who goes by that nickname ?
yes . the defendant ,
lalo hierra . uh , thank you , agent thorburn .
just a ... uh , actually , nothing further , your honor .
we would request a short recess
to prepare a new name that we &apos;d like to add to the witness list .
granted . we &apos;ll break for lunch .
be back at 2 : 00 .
good . he &apos;s scared .
alicia , hi . how are you ?
good .
what &apos;s up here ? hi , marilyn .
hi , alicia . i &apos;m sorry . i had a bout of nausea but i &apos;m all good .
um , do you guys mind if i ... if i , uh ...
oh , here it is ... if i eat ?
no , not at all .
welcome , by the way .
thanks . so ...
this is the new ... firm .
it &apos;s nice .
we &apos;re in the early stages yet .
what do you need ?
mm . sorry , pumpkin pop @-@ tart .
they &apos;re the only things that settle my stomach .
um , peter
would like to come by and congratulate you ,
and we were acting as a sort of advance team .
you want to negotiate his first visit ?
no .
yes .
there can be no photographs while he &apos;s here .
no contacting the press .
no clients to be informed of his visit .
no press releases .
look , if peter wants to come here to
congratulate his wife on her new firm ,
i &apos;m thrilled .
but there &apos;ll be no policing between us .
no rules , no exemptions . just peter
deciding to drop by . that &apos;s all .
look , alicia , the only ...
eli , are you all right ?
y @-@ yes . i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m , uh ...
no , uh , what , um ...
okay .
uh , i &apos;ll be right back .
he ran .
what ?
lalo . uh , eduardo hierra .
he fled back to mexico .
he ... when ?
an hour ago . he skipped bail ,
and the rumor is he caught a private plane to nuevo laredo .
tomas doesn &apos;t have to testify .
eli , are you all right ?
i was wondering if i &apos;d run into you .
i just didn &apos;t think it would be so literal .
i saw you .
i was up ...
uh , how lo ... how long are you in town ?
um , a few days .
i ... i &apos;ve been following you .
you &apos;ve ... ?
i mean , wi @-@ winning the election and the governorship .
it &apos;s all very impressive .
thank you , thank you .
you , too . you &apos;re at the outsider group .
yes , um , we &apos;ve been following each other .
well , um , i better get going .
i have this thing with my boss .
yeah , m @-@ me , too , me , too .
let &apos;s have dinner .
i &apos;m ... what ?
tonight .
let &apos;s have dinner .
um ... yeah , i &apos;d love that .
will gardner .
oh , hey , joe , what a pleasure .
i need you bad now .
i &apos;d like that .
today ?
no , i haven &apos;t seen her .
okay , what &apos;s her name ?
diane , who &apos;s natalie flores ?
she used to work here . why ?
that was her boss joe pallotta the lobbyist .
he wants to bring all his legal work here ,
but he sent natalie to sound us out .
you haven &apos;t seen her ?
no .
okay , well ,
can you keep an eye out for her ?
she has a case she needs help with .
we want to give her all our attention .
yes ?
it was a good meeting .
she liked me .
what was the case ?
some mexican illegal alien thing .
howard , what did you say to her ?
nothing .
nothing ... i complimented her .
i said how great mexicans are ,
how sexy they are .
oh , lord .
she asked for alicia florrick &apos;s address .
it &apos;s not gone yet .
call joe back and explain .
hello .
mrs. florrick , they took him , they took tomas .
what ?
uh , he @-@ hello , elena ?
the agents said that they were taking him to nuevo laredo .
that &apos;s where lalo is .
lalo will kill tomas as soon as he gets off the bus .
okay , just sit tight , elena , it &apos;s been a misunderstanding .
i &apos;ll get on with the ausa .
i saw what he does to snitches , mrs. florrick .
he cuts their stomachs open , hangs them from bridges .
please help me , please .
i will . i will call you right back .
yes , i need to speak to ausa karl dolan .
it &apos;s an emergency .
well , find him .
kalinda .
you shouldn &apos;t be here , robyn .
i &apos;ll be gone in ten minutes .
what do you need ?
have they hired anybody yet to replace me ?
you can &apos;t come back here , robyn .
i know , but why not ?
if they haven &apos;t hired anyone , why ?
you &apos;re at florrick @-@ agos .
but they &apos;re going to lay me off .
i &apos;m sorry , could you , um , just put in a good word for me ?
look , robyn , it won &apos;t work .
they won &apos;t hire you back here .
you know , too much has happened .
you need to make yourself hard .
you need to make yourself indispensable .
that &apos;s why people keep you on .
but i &apos;m not you .
you don &apos;t need to be me .
they were laying me off
at the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office five years ago ,
so i took control .
nothing changes you like the loss of a job .
now go , you can &apos;t be here .
go ahead , take it .
no .
eli , if you don &apos;t get it , i &apos;m going to .
what happened to your cirque du soleil boyfriend ?
he got married .
i &apos;m sorry .
you &apos;re not sorry .
it &apos;s the governor &apos;s office .
i &apos;ll call back .
i &apos;m hearing your boss speak at the minority voters &apos; conference .
yes , i think he &apos;s talking about redistricting ,
how it &apos;s marginalizing the minority vote .
actually , uh , unfortunately he had to cancel that .
oh , when was this ?
redistricting is a hard subject .
either way , you ... you offend someone .
uh , i should get this .
please .
hello .
alicia ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
oh , my god , when ?
no , no , no , i &apos;ll ... i , i will join you .
um , give me 20 minutes .
eli , i &apos;m so sorry , i ,
um , i have to ...
this friend-- he &apos;s being deported .
can we do this another time ?
yes , of course .
i understand you &apos;re upset .
upset ?
we &apos;re talking about a man &apos;s life .
tomas ruiz did everything you asked .
not everything ... he didn &apos;t testify .
because he never had the chance .
look , that has nothing to do with my job .
the person he was going to testify against fled .
that is not his fault .
we have very few s @-@ visas to give out ,
and the rules for granting them are strict .
the recipient has to provide testimony
that helps lead to a conviction .
mr. dolan , you asked my client
to inform on a dangerous criminal ,
and when that criminal jumped bail ,
you deported him to the exact same place the criminal fled to .
i realize it sounds unfair .
no , what it sounds like is a death sentence .
okay , this conversation is moot .
4 : 00 a.m. tomas ruiz
was boarded onto a deportation bus .
he &apos;ll be in mexico in 12 hours .
i &apos;m sorry , there &apos;s nothing i can do .
this is the problem .
the feds were looking for tomas i. ruiz .
he &apos;s a con man ...
insurance fraud , airbag theft .
that &apos;s why his deportation was expedited .
our guy is tomas y. ruiz ,
but , uh , they think he &apos;s the con man .
they &apos;re deporting the wrong guy .
we can &apos;t clear this up ?
unfortunately immigration has him listed with both spellings .
and since neither of them has
a valid social security number ...
as far as the government &apos;s concerned ,
they &apos;re the same person .
so , what do we do ?
find the other tomas ruiz .
show the feds they deported the wrong man .
and how do we do that ?
let me find him .
well , we have 11 hours till tomas crosses the border .
then , i &apos;d better get started .
okay , i &apos;ll see if i can get anywhere in court .
howard lyman is one of our oldest partners .
we keep him around as a legacy .
i &apos;ll be right back . want anything ?
look , have natalie flores come back .
we &apos;ll have a good sit @-@ down .
because i &apos;m warning you now ,
florrick @-@ agos isn &apos;t up to this case .
it &apos;s really too bad .
are you talking to me ?
yes .
it &apos;s too bad about will .
he &apos;s still in pain .
i &apos;m david lee , by the way .
i &apos;m isabel .
want a pretzel ?
no , thank you .
he &apos;s still in pain about alicia .
and who &apos;s alicia ?
oh , someone who ...
used to work here .
he could tell you more .
i &apos;m looking for tomas ruiz .
he &apos;s not here .
i &apos;m working as a skip tracer .
if you help us find him ,
there will be a percentage of the bond for you .
he &apos;s not here , but he had a girlfriend--
christina stewart .
do you have her address ?
your wife would not agree to set any rules .
she said if you wanted to come see her at her new firm ,
she would welcome it , but ...
sorry .
she would not police her firm .
it would be our advice to steer clear
until her firm establishes itself .
no , i &apos;m , i &apos;m going tonight , thanks .
um , anything else ?
um , yes , we &apos;ve , um , we &apos;ve gone to the trouble
of canceling your speech to the minority voter council .
oh , no , we &apos;ve decided to keep that .
i &apos;m sorry , what ?
it &apos;s worth our effort to do a redistricting speech .
marilyn .
eli , i thought we decided it would hurt the governor
to come down on one side or the other .
yes , i &apos;ve changed my mind .
okay , so i guess i &apos;m giving a speech .
eli , what is going on ?
i changed my mind .
have you never changed your mind ?
no .
well , this is what it looks like .
i &apos;m looking for tomas .
i don &apos;t know anybody named tomas .
you can tell him for me that gloria is looking for him .
i told you , i don &apos;t know him .
you can tell him that illinois has laws about child support ,
and he &apos;d better pay .
open the door , you son of a bitch !
you got a kid , and you didn &apos;t tell me about it ? !
what ?
i have to hear about it from some
blonde skank who showed up at my doorstep .
hello , tomas .
so , you &apos;re saying the u.s. attorney is in breach ?
yes , your honor . they made an agreement ,
and they didn &apos;t honor it .
we honored every part of our agreement ,
except the granting of the visa .
that &apos;s the only part that matters !
because mr. ruiz did not comply
with his duties under the agreement .
your honor , they created the danger
by asking him to testify .
but when he was denied that chance ,
through no fault of his own ,
they let him be sent right into the lion &apos;s mouth !
and he &apos;ll be there in ten hours .
so really , it &apos;s an equitable argument .
robyn , what have you got ?
the other tomas ruiz .
what do you mean ?
i found the other tomas ruiz .
you did ?
in two hours ?
yes .
uh , will he testify ?
well , he wants something in return .
ten grand .
get him in here , and we &apos;ll work it out .
oh , and , robyn ,
good job .
the problem , mrs. florrick , is , your client is coming
to a court of equity with unclean hands ,
或恶意行为的原告提供救济
which , as i &apos;m sure you will remember from law school ,
you &apos;re not allowed to do .
your honor , excuse me .
we &apos;d like to amend our argument .
we &apos;ve found the real tomas ruiz .
the real ... ? who , now ?
our client was mistakenly deported
because immigration confused him with someone else .
we &apos;ve located the man they were actually looking for .
well , that &apos;s a bit of a sticky wicket ,
seeing as how your client &apos;s already on the transport .
yes , your honor , which is why time is of the essence here .
yes , but unfortunately ,
i &apos;m not empowered to hear that claim .
only the board of immigration appeals is .
and i &apos;d hurry .
the problem is , mrs. florrick , the transport &apos;s already left .
yes , but the wrong man is on the bus .
no , your honor . there &apos;s no dispute
that tomas y. ruiz was in this country illegally ,
and therefore , subject to deportation .
yes , but not expedited deportation .
i &apos;m afraid that &apos;s a distinction for earlier .
prior to the transport &apos;s departure .
we can &apos;t waste taxpayer money turning a bus around
to bring someone back who &apos;s just going
to be deported again in a few months .
this isn &apos;t about deportation .
our client faces grave danger the second he gets to mexico .
even if that &apos;s true , your honor , that &apos;s an asylum claim .
let me guess . you don &apos;t hear asylum claims ?
that &apos;s correct , mrs. florrick . we don &apos;t hear asylum claims .
we only hear appeals of asylum claims .
the initial claim has to be brought to an immigration judge .
i told you to cancel everything .
oh , ah , no . send her in .
i &apos;m sorry to drop in unexpected .
please , please . no , uh , would you ... ?
no , i ... i can &apos;t stay very long . i have to get to court .
but i wanted to apologize .
for ?
for dinner last night .
or not @-@ dinner last night .
for running out on you .
you didn &apos;t running out on me .
i &apos;m afraid i did .
but it was for a good cause , and , anyway , uh ...
i have to run out on you again right now ,
but i would love it
if we could have dinner the next time .
that would be great .
next time you are in town , yeah .
oh , and , um , here ,
i got you dried apricots .
i dont know why .
i thought of you with dried apricots .
ok , i &apos;ll talk to you later .
natalie , wait .
we have to have dinner tonight , or it would never happen .
really ?
why is that ?
i don &apos;t know . i just have a premonition that
we both lead very complicated lives ...
mr. gold ?
not now !
if we don &apos;t take advantage of these few minutes we have ,
we might never get the chance again .
i &apos;ll make a reservation .
i don &apos;t normally do this .
what ?
run after people .
i &apos;m not a running @-@ after @-@ people sort .
and i don &apos;t normally buy dried apricots .
they were just in the store downstairs , so i bought them .
throw them away .
okay ? they &apos;re probably gross .
so , you &apos;ll call me about where ?
i will .
how you doing ?
good .
who &apos;s alicia ?
what ?
who &apos;s alicia ?
someone thinks you &apos;re in pain over alicia ,
and that &apos;s what i &apos;m about .
why are you about anything ?
i don &apos;t know .
i didn &apos;t think i was .
who someone ? who &apos;s telling you this ?
david ... something .
he looks like a jack @-@ o &apos; -lantern .
david lee .
i don &apos;t know . one of your lawyers .
he doesn &apos;t like you in my office .
he wants to poison the stream .
so , who is she ?
alicia was an employee
who left to start her own firm .
you were sleeping with her ?
for a while .
then what ?
what happened after a while ?
i don &apos;t know .
was she good ?
are we having fun ?
you tell me .
you taste like chocolate .
that &apos;s because i &apos;m made of chocolate .
your honor ,
only someone facing a recognized form
of persecution can file a claim for asylum .
which tomas ruiz is , your honor .
oh , really ? which one ? race ?
religion ? nationality ? politics ?
social group . he &apos;s part of a social group
that is known to face persecution in many parts of mexico .
and what social group would that be ?
snitches , your honor .
oh , come on .
this is an affidavit from a professor of mexican cultural studies
testifying that large portions of mexico are controlled
by drug cartels who deal violently ...
and i am sure
it &apos;s fascinating , but the simple fact is ,
tomas ruiz is not , actually , a snitch ,
because he never actually snitched .
your honor , that &apos;s sophistry .
yes , mrs. florrick .
even if snitches qualify as a social group ,
you haven &apos;t demonstrated that mr. ruiz meets the criteria .
your honor , we have seven and a half hours
before mr. ruiz is in mexico .
洛克哈特 &amp; 加德纳律所
yes , but , as bob dylan said ,
&quot; couldn &apos;t help but make me feel ashamed ... &quot;
hello ?
natalie , it &apos;s will gardner .
i wonder if you remember me ?
i &apos;m one of the partners at lockhart &amp; gardner .
uh , yes , i remember .
i have to apologize for yesterday .
i didn &apos;t realize you had dropped by .
and i know you &apos;ve gone somewhere else with your case .
yes , florrick @-@ agos .
but i wanted you to know i reviewed
all tomas ruiz &apos;s materials ,
and if you &apos;re ever looking for another perspective ,
please don &apos;t hesitate to call .
thank you for calling , mr. gardner ,
but , um , i didn &apos;t have the best experience at your office .
i know . i understand that , and i &apos;m very sorry .
howard lyman is one of our legacy partners ,
and he would very much like to apologize for his comments .
please , natalie , just drop by ,
let us talk to you .
let me think about it .
good .
that &apos;s all i ask .
thank you . good @-@ bye .
you &apos;re good luck . you know that ?
i do know that .
lesbian , gay or transgender ?
only if he &apos;s in danger because of it .
what about governmental persecution ?
you mean , his political beliefs ?
or we just argue that the mexican government can &apos;t protect him .
they &apos;re not the ones threatening him .
i served dolan . we are back in court in an hour .
great . now we just need something to argue .
blood feud .
you could argue there &apos;s a blood feud
between tomas &apos; family and hierra &apos;s family .
but we don &apos;t have any evidence of it , do we ?
we might .
really ? what ?
robyn , what ?
have you noticed that everyone &apos;s changing ?
yeah .
so , what &apos;s up ?
i &apos;m concerned about eli .
what is it this time ?
he flip @-@ flopped on your speaking
at the minority voter conference .
well , you know , one of the things i value about eli
is that he keeps an open mind ,
which means that he sometimes changes it .
i think he might have changed it
because of someone else &apos;s influence .
her name is natalie flores .
she works for a lobbying firm .
are you saying that you think eli &apos;s on
the payroll of some lobbyist ?
no , i think it &apos;s personal .
are you all right ?
i &apos;m fine . i &apos;m sorry . i hate being weak .
you &apos;re not being weak .
can i get you something , or ... ?
oh , i &apos;m out of my pop @-@ tarts .
that &apos;s not good .
no , it &apos;s not .
natalie fores ?
uh , yes , yes , right . um ...
well , just to be clear , if eli &apos;s directing policy
due to somebody &apos;s outside influence ,
then , that &apos;s a potential ethical violation there .
yes . i understand .
and i &apos;m gonna look into it .
okay . thank you .
i was complimenting her .
didn &apos;t ask her to clean my office .
i just think this one is ... touchy .
this one ?
this ... this natalie .
maybe she &apos;s a lesbian .
i don &apos;t think she &apos;s a lesbian .
but she is our link to a potentially valuable client .
howard , we &apos;re going to need you to apologize immediately .
fine .
well , what do you want me to say ?
i think it &apos;s important for natalie to understand
that , you know , you see her as intelligent and capable .
not just some spicy tamale ?
hmm ? oh , come on . i &apos;m just kidding .
kidding is what got us into this mess .
no , political correctness got us into this mess .
but i &apos;ll get us out of it .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;m gonna do the speech
at the minority voter conference .
you aren &apos;t ?
redistricting cuts both ways .
i don &apos;t want to be accused of supporting ghettoizing anyone .
you aren &apos;t ghettoizing anyone . they want this .
a lot of people want a lot of things .
yes , but we &apos;ve already rsvp &apos;d and ...
and what ?
why is this suddenly so important that i do this , eli ?
because this redistricting amendment has legs .
no .
what changed your mind ?
eli ,
i need to know that i can trust you .
i need to know that the advice you give me
is in my best interests .
it has never been anything but .
good .
as long as you don &apos;t let anyone use you .
or me .
the next time you want to correct my behavior , come to me .
what are you talking about ?
i don &apos;t know what you think you saw ,
but if you &apos;re trying to score points with peter ...
i &apos;m not trying to score points .
then why bring it up ?
because it &apos;s my job .
my private life falls way outside your job description .
not when it impacts the counsel you give the governor .
let &apos;s get something straight : i have been with peter since ...
i &apos;m sorry . i can &apos;t do this right now .
oh , spare me the rigors of pregnancy bs !
your honor , blood feuds are a recognized ground for asylum .
yes , in places where they exist .
albania , for example , the caucasus , sicily ...
the concept applies anywhere someone is targeted
because of bad blood between families .
in this case , lalo hierra
and his family have a grudge against tomas ruiz .
no . they don &apos;t hate him because his name is tomas ruiz .
they hate him because he ...
... almost snitched .
besides , your honor ,
even if they could argue blood feud ,
where &apos;s the evidence ?
right here .
what a surprise . now what ?
just this morning , mrs . ruiz received this bullet in her mailbox ,
with the letters &quot; l.c. &quot; written on the side .
that &apos;s lalo hierra &apos;s calling card . it &apos;s a clear threat .
hold on . we have no way to verify ...
your honor , as soon as this was brought
to our attention we brought it to you .
okay , enough .
mrs. florrick , mr. agos , i &apos;m sorry ,
but blood feud is a very specific claim ,
and i &apos;m just not seeing enough here to support it .
your honor , this bullet is clearly a warning
of violence to come to mrs. ruiz and her family .
but it isn &apos;t relevant to asylum .
maybe not ,
以严重方式走私人口的被害者
but it is relevant to an application for a t visa .
t visa ?
yes .
the ruiz family has been the victim of a crime ,
witness intimidation .
that is one of the recognized grounds for granting a t visa .
your honor , this is absurd .
hold on , mr. dolan .
&quot; and someone says ,
&apos;you &apos;re in the wrong place , my friend .
you better leave . &apos; &quot;
bob dylan again , your honor ?
it &apos;s a good claim , mrs. florrick .
actually , it &apos;s an excellent claim , but unfortunately
i can &apos;t consider a visa application .
your honor , mr. ruiz &apos;s bus is going to reach the border
in less than two hours .
i understand , but you need to see
an immigration case worker for that .
and the chain of custody ?
as soon as she received the bullet , mrs . ruiz called me .
i rushed over and took possession of it .
even so , i can only get
to a t visa for mrs. ruiz and her son .
they were the ones who were the victims of intimidation .
yes , but it was meant as a warning for the entire family .
perhaps . but by the time the bullet was delivered ,
mr. ruiz was already out of the state .
look , mrs ....
bardos , but estelle is fine .
estelle , any minute now that bus is gonna cross the border
into nuevo laredo , mexico .
our client won &apos;t make it a mile past the checkpoint .
i &apos;m sorry , mrs. florrick ,
i truly am , but we have rules .
rules ? really ?
let me tell you something , lady , your rules
are right out of 1984 .
the book , not the year .
i am sorry .
hello , mr. gardner ? i would like to meet .
natalie , how good to see you again .
mr. lyman . how are you ?
fine , thank you .
natalie , thank you for giving l.g. a second chance .
yes , and i &apos;d like to apologize for our last meeting .
i was a little distracted by the news
of a dear friend of mine dying .
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s fine . but i wanted to be clear
that , uh ... how wrong i was in my comments the last time .
think nothing of it . oh , uh , i &apos;d like to introduce you
to the partner at our lobbying firm ,
joe pallotta .
hey , hey , man .
how &apos;s it going ?
no , the transport is stopped at the border ,
but they &apos;re about to release it . why ? is ...
is there a problem ?
for me ? no . for the government of mexico , possibly .
this is immigration enforcement &apos;s expedited deportation list .
and you can see , tomas i. ruiz is on that bus .
he &apos;s one of the most infamous con men in the u.s. ,
responsible for millions of dollars in damages .
he specializes in airbag fraud .
airbag fraud ?
not only does he cheat people ,
but if they get into an accident ,
they don &apos;t have a functioning airbag .
and given mexico &apos;s traffic safety record ,
i &apos;m sure that would be troubling .
but rather than deal with the problem here ,
the u.s. government decided to pass the buck
by sending him back to you .
of course , it is always within the discretion of any sovereign nation
whether or not they choose to accept a deportee back into their country .
they turned him away at the border .
oh , my god . thank you .
thank you .
daddy &apos;s gonna be okay .
feeling good ?
i guess .
you should be . you pulled it out of the fire for us .
well , it &apos;s my job .
yeah . it is .
keep doing it .
wait , his own country wouldn &apos;t let him in ?
somehow , he ended up on the mexican consulate watch list .
oh , thank god .
alicia , thank you .
just remember to tell all your fee @-@ paying friends about us .
bye .
excuse me . um , i &apos;d like to order two glasses of this .
thanks .
you &apos;d be wise to get here fast .
i &apos;m in a great mood and i have a corporate credit card .
natalie , hi .
hi . you sound ...
something .
it &apos;s just that i &apos;m not gonna be able to make it .
it &apos;s work , naturally .
peter &apos;s decision to cancel his speech is wreaking havoc .
we have ... legislators from minority districts
at our door with pitchforks .
and you &apos;re the last line of defense .
i &apos;m sorry , natalie .
peter needs me .
he &apos;s lucky to have you .
fly safe .
that was just me being stupid .
eli , if this is too complicated ...
no . no , it &apos;s not .
look , i lie 24 / 7 for my job ...
it &apos;s actually a gift ...
but lying to you gave me a stomachache .
s @-@ so ...
how were the dried apricots ?
not so good .
well , maybe next time i &apos;ll ...
i just had to do that .
well , marilyn , i hope i didn &apos;t make any ethical infractions
on the elevator ride .
no , you pushed the button with dignity and honor .
ah , you must be a good influence on me .
i wanted to push all the buttons
and stop on every floor . hey .
these are some digs .
uh , i think the operative word is &quot; cheap . &quot;
nice to see you again , marilyn .
you , too .
okay . where on the unethical spectrum does it fall
to have an intern help my wife unpack ?
well , technically in the red zone ,
but we &apos;ll note it as a goodwill gesture
by the governor to a citizen .
well , thank you .
guys .
thank you for dropping by , mr. governor .
no problem , mrs. first lady .
you know what ?
i think you &apos;re gonna take over the world from here .
you think so ?
