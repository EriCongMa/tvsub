the mosconi codex .
this is no ordinary book .
i think hagen is using you .
the only chance we have of getting a leg up on him
is by deciphering the codex first .
neal took off , didn &apos;t he ?
yeah , he sure did .
find out where he went .
surveillance cameras a block from the vodka room
led us to a cabbie .
is there any reason he &apos;d slip away to come here ?
neal always has a reason .
you okay ?
i can &apos;t exhale until i hear you
walk through that door at night .
agent siegel &apos;s murder
was a random act of violence .
but it &apos;s not gonna happen to me .
i promise .
but the codex has been hidden away its entire existence .
how did you get a copy ?
our copy of the codex is incomplete .
how much do you have ?
a single chapter .
it &apos;s chapter 13 .
in all the books he ever produced ,
he never wrote a chapter 13 .
haircut , new suit .
what &apos;s the occasion ?
on this very day ,
i walked into a downtown art gallery
and first laid eyes on my future wife .
routine art crime investigation
turns into the luckiest day of your life .
i agree .
and to celebrate ,
we &apos;re going to the same restaurant we went to on our first date .
papaya king ?
la cucina de tua nonna .
red sauce , wine in straw bottles .
napkin tucked into your collar ?
i &apos;m making it a point to remember all the anniversaries .
birthdays , weddings ,
the day we brought satchmo home from the breeders .
i imagined a stork delivery .
december 7th .
pearl harbor day ?
another day that will live in infamy .
first time i arrested you .
and four years later we did it all over again .
yeah .
but this time ,
you gave me jewelry .
which is why i asked you to meet me here .
i removed your anklet
for our undercover operation at the vodka room .
soon after , i found this .
don &apos;t we have hundreds of those back at the office ?
i have a hunch this has special significance .
office building , 56th street .
gravich chiropractic .
our next case .
could be mine .
i &apos;m here to help .
you can go home now .
this year , skip the straw bottle wine .
spring for some sangiovese .
i &apos;ll order what i always order .
i downloaded it to my phone
so i &apos;d always have it with me .
i still love italian .
i still love you .
so am i the first guy you ever made a sign for ?
it was the first sign that didn &apos;t say &quot; go away . &quot;
oh , it wouldn &apos;t have discouraged me .
did you ever think where you would be
if you didn &apos;t walk into my gallery that day ?
nope . never .
too scary to think about .
how &apos;s work going ? getting any better ?
yeah , we added siegel &apos;s picture to the honor wall .
that was something , at least .
hey , what kind of celebration is this ?
glasses are almost empty .
thank you .
mi scusi .
we didn &apos;t order these .
what &apos;s wrong ? do you know her ?
i think i do .
that &apos;s jill .
jill .
from quantico .
oh , that &apos;s jill ?
right . my ex @-@ girlfriend .
peter .
yes .
it &apos;s been a long time .
20 years long .
i never thought i &apos;d see you here , tonight .
i hunted you down .
this is my wife , elizabeth .
it &apos;s great to meet you .
uh , wait , i &apos;ve interrupted something .
oh , no .
this is just an average tuesday night for us , right ?
come on , sit down . join us .
okay .
okay .
okay .
so , um , what are you doing in new york ?
i &apos;m on a case . thought i &apos;d look you up .
how &apos;d you find me ?
that &apos;s what i do , peter .
you still in s.s.g ?
last time i checked in .
what &apos;s s.s.g ?
s.s.g , special surveillance group .
we track down the bad guys , follow &apos; em ,
record &apos; em if we can .
sounds fascinating .
you still drink bourbon ?
on occasion .
well , this is a damn special one .
how about you ?
sure , why not ?
remember our toast ?
truth , justice ...
and stay out of our way .
here it is .
every time i pass this house
i was tempted to knock and ask for a look inside .
oh , you should have .
my landlady would have invited you in for coffee .
god , it &apos;s like a good book
i &apos;m finally getting to read .
i can &apos;t believe you live here .
well , i just rent the epilogue .
i get you a glass of wine ?
fbi agents are allowed to drink on the job ?
well , we &apos;re always on the job .
what choice do we have ?
and now that you &apos;re joining us ,
i &apos;m gonna corrupt you too .
thank you .
so where &apos;s this phantom chapter 13 of yours ?
right here .
it can &apos;t be .
why ? what &apos;s wrong ?
what &apos;s wrong is that it &apos;s right .
it &apos;s--it--it &apos;s a mosconi , but that &apos;s impossible .
that would make it the only chapter 13 that he ever made .
well , it was copied directly from the codex
at the gershon museum .
it is his handwriting .
this is crazy .
and this .
here .
it &apos;s a study for a painting .
that he didn &apos;t put on canvas
until a year after this was published .
so these pages , they couldn &apos;t have been done by anyone else .
and this has to be from his new york period .
1886 .
he was here less than a year .
fbi art crimes database .
maybe he wrote his only chapter 13 in new york as well .
well , mosconi rushed back to italy in a hurry .
the why he ran is a mystery .
and the book he left us is more of a what than a why .
he was a puzzling man who loved puzzles .
see , mosconi believed that if someone wanted the truth ,
they should have to search for it .
what--what are you doing ?
if this book is a puzzle ,
maybe these are the pieces .
look at that .
come here .
oh , my gosh .
here &apos;s one .
where &apos;s the middle ?
it &apos;s gotta be here somewhere .
it &apos;s incredible .
it looks like a stained glass window .
but if he wrote chapter 13 when he was in new york ,
this stained glass window
could be right here in manhattan .
do you--do you realize what you &apos;ve just done ?
made a mess of the codex ?
no , i @-@ i think you might have just made
one of the most important discoveries
on mosconi in decades .
ah , working into the night ?
impressive .
you should know the fbi frowns on overtime .
uh , we--we &apos;ve made incredible progress , sir .
yes .
i &apos;m gonna let agent caffrey fill you in .
sure .
you know , i &apos;m gonna ...
research this window .
see if i can find out where it is .
yeah , i &apos;ll put my fbi resources on it as well .
we can see who finds it first .
&apos;kay .
what ?
you , business , and women-- the unholy trinity .
rebecca is all about the business of the codex .
oh , like i &apos;ve never seen this before .
kate , alex , sarah .
now rebecca .
there &apos;s more behind this than the codex .
so you &apos;re an expert on romance now ?
one who has loved not wisely , but too well .
othello .
yeah . we all know how that turned out .
you okay ?
pretty quiet on the way home .
well , i didn &apos;t wanna break the spell .
oh , look , honey .
jill challenged me .
you know that i didn &apos;t enter quantico
all that sure of myself .
but she tried so hard to beat me
that i worked my butt off to beat her .
and--
look at you now .
no , that &apos;s not what i meant .
it &apos;s--it &apos;s just that i never thought
that i could finish as high as i did .
you know that .
you &apos;re the reason i &apos;m the man i am today .
continue .
i couldn &apos;t have gotten through this past year without you .
or ... any year .
you know , it &apos;s still our anniversary .
i was hoping you &apos;d say that .
thank you , detective .
right , well , let &apos;s hope it does .
bye . we &apos;ll take it from here .
that was nypd .
two days ago someone in brooklyn commandeered a vehicle
posing as an fbi agent .
yesterday he struck again .
did he flash a badge ?
nypd doesn &apos;t know if it &apos;s real or not .
or if it could be siegel &apos;s .
chances are slight that it is ,
but we need to check it out .
could be our first solid lead in two weeks .
i want you and jones on this .
two people i trust .
well , 1.1 / 2 .
who is that ?
uh , no one important .
come up with something to catch this guy .
now go .
you seem nervous .
just leave , just leave .
neal caffrey .
do we know each other ?
jill stone . i stayed up all night
reading the case files of you two .
couldn &apos;t put it down .
the good ones keep you up at night .
mm @-@ hmm . the bad ones even longer .
he was just leaving .
i wasn &apos;t expecting you .
we &apos;re a secretive bunch .
tell me we &apos;re looking at the same thing .
peter burke uncomfortable .
that &apos;s not his natural state .
you know she &apos;s f.b.i ?
well , it &apos;s not your run of the mill suit .
not that she ever wears one .
look at the way she holds herself .
open . totally exposed .
confidence and plenty of it .
ooh . oh , that &apos;s not the first time
she &apos;s touched him like that .
they have a past .
look at her eyes . all over his face .
yeah , she wants to see if he still feels anything .
whoa .
whoa what ?
they slept together .
peter ?
not recently .
all right , you know i heard
he had a pretty serious relationship
with a female agent down at quantico .
she joined ssg .
the cia of the fbi ?
those are some badass agents .
that explains the confidence .
that &apos;s peter &apos;s ex .
it has to be .
i couldn &apos;t talk about the case in front of your wife .
white collar related ?
i &apos;m tracking a tech genius named
mason sadowski .
doesn &apos;t look all that intimidating .
in today &apos;s world that &apos;s what trouble looks like .
he &apos;s part of a team that invented
a new and extremely dangerous microchip
for one of our top defense contractors .
then he decided he didn &apos;t wanna share ?
exactly .
must be a very important chip .
something to do with decoding passwords .
with it , a two @-@ bit hacker could break through
our most sophisticated security walls .
low @-@ hanging fruit for our enemies .
yeah , he put it on the black market .
i &apos;ve established a cover i.d. as a broker for iran .
set the hook yet ?
he swallowed it .
good .
waiting for a buy time to reel him in .
my problem : most buyers
representing foreign interests come in twos
in order for the ruse to work , i need a partner .
someone with undercover experience .
someone you can trust .
more than any other agent in new york .
section chief bruce hawes put the order through personally .
oh , bruce , huh ?
not only bruce .
your name gets dropped a lot in washington .
nice to hear .
you know new york , and i don &apos;t have gps .
besides , you &apos;re the best . next to me , of course .
oh , that was quantico . this is now .
i &apos;ll set up the buy .
this is gonna be fun .
got that too .
here .
good to see you .
take care .
bye .
she left peter with a lot to think about .
get back to work !
and still uncomfortable .
oh , hey , you got plans later ?
why ?
asac gave us an assignment .
nypd informed peter
someone may be using siegel &apos;s badge in brooklyn .
all right , i &apos;ll coordinate with nypd .
we &apos;ll need the perp &apos;s description and his m.o.
so we know what we &apos;re looking for .
or we help him find us .
jill &apos;s just an fbi agent who needs help on a case .
that &apos;s it . end of story .
you never look at jones like that .
drop it .
hold on a second .
does el know that your old ex is your new partner ?
i &apos;m gonna tell her tonight when it &apos;s more relaxed .
all right , at least give up the details .
what broke you two lovers up ?
i don &apos;t know .
she went west , i went east .
it doesn &apos;t matter anymore .
it always matters .
no , what matters
is that you catch the guy flashing the badge .
all right , jones and i are gonna cruise brooklyn tonight
in sheep &apos;s clothing , but ...
but what ?
the wolves need a sleeker wardrobe .
yes .
drop me off .
dinner &apos;s almost ready .
hi .
hi .
jill came to my office today .
i figured she would .
why don &apos;t you pour me a glass of wine
and tell me all about it ?
what kind of wine is this ?
oh , that &apos;s the bottle mozzie gave us last christmas
you were afraid to open .
still am .
you expecting someone ?
no .
oh ... hi , elizabeth .
um , wow , it smells like italy in here .
i forgot people still make dinner .
i forgot people just drop by .
i &apos;m so sorry i keep interrupting you .
i should have called first , but we &apos;re just kind of in a rush .
&quot; we &quot; ?
oh , peter .
i found where the guy &apos;s holed up ,
so we gotta do recon on the thing now , right now .
you guys workin &apos; on a case together ?
that &apos;s why jill is in new york
and since it was white collar related--
what &apos;s it about ?
mm , it &apos;s classified .
oh , well , nothing we discuss ever leaves this house .
i &apos;m sorry , hon .
we can &apos;t discuss this one .
you okay ?
why wouldn &apos;t i be ?
i &apos;ll call you on my way home .
i &apos;ll try to get him home in one piece .
yeah .
do you live in this ?
when i have to .
all you &apos;re missing is a fridge and a hot plate .
well , i &apos;m thinking about putting in
a fireplace and jacuzzi .
that &apos;d be nice .
how come you &apos;re still in the field ?
i mean , you had big ambitions way back then .
i expected you to be assistant director by now .
i &apos;m on a washington track .
for the time being , i &apos;m serving double duty .
asac and neal &apos;s handler .
i &apos;m pretty happy doing both .
peter ...
what ?
you don &apos;t have to put up a strong front for me .
you were the supervisor of an agent who got killed .
i know you &apos;re hurting .
the entire bureau is .
yeah .
it &apos;s been hard to shake it .
i lost my partner eight years ago .
still can &apos;t .
cruisin &apos; for the bad guy in a sweet ride ,
just like crockett and tubbs .
i am living the dream .
did you base your entire future on &quot; miami vice &quot; ?
ah , hill street blues , cagney and lace
any show about law enforcement .
i had a different perspective .
let me guess , rooting for the bad guys ?
only when they were good , cagney .
we &apos;ve been driving around for about three hours .
where is this guy ?
we were chasing a couple that robbed a bank in pomona .
they split up . i followed the guy .
earl was following the girl . she pretended to surrender .
she shot him .
is that why you work alone ?
it wasn &apos;t my fault , but it still feels like it was .
siegel used to come to my office
and just wanna hear about my old cases .
he couldn &apos;t get enough .
i brought him here from chicago .
david was my responsibility .
can &apos;t protect everybody .
no .
and you can &apos;t take their place .
even though sometimes you wish you could .
any closer to finding the killer ?
not yet .
today we got a potential lead .
you &apos;ll find him .
justice is not always as swift as we want it to be .
isn &apos;t that our guy ?
yeah , he &apos;s out of his room . now &apos;s our chance .
what ?
i don &apos;t know .
bad feeling .
i hope we don &apos;t get jacked before our perp shows up .
hold on a second .
whoa , what are you doing ?
you know peter doesn &apos;t like folks touching his buttons .
trying to get a better view .
looks like your hope is about to come true .
on your left .
yeah .
i need your car .
official f.b.i business .
yep .
get out now ! criminal &apos;s getting away .
be cool , man !
how are we gonna get our car back ?
real f.b.i.
hands on the roof .
what do you got ?
i would have had you if i wore flats .
well , i never knew you to make excuses before .
okay , you won that one .
savor it , because it &apos;ll be your last .
thanks for letting us in . honeymooners , right ?
always forgetting something .
si , senor .
come on , let &apos;s find a place to stash the gun
in case we get patted down before the buy .
you think he took the chip with him ?
if i thought so , i would have taken him outside .
then maybe he left it here .
give me the gun .
you could have had any assignment you wanted
when we left quantico .
why los angeles ?
hey , that looks familiar .
yeah .
same guys we passed on our way in .
they might be competitive shoppers for our chip .
let &apos;s find out who they are .
take a selfie like we &apos;re a couple on a date .
come on , closer . we gotta sell it .
neal , you got him ?
you left him bleeding on the sidewalk .
a bullet in his chest .
an f.b.i agent .
one of us .
i didn &apos;t kill the dude .
i pulled that badge and gun outta the trash . i swear .
you know , when a murderer swears ,
i tend not to believe them .
it was a friday .
about a month ago . when people cash their g @-@ checks .
oh , yeah ?
what time of day was it ?
later . almost dark .
where were you before that ? between 3 : 00 and 4 : 00 p.m. ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t remember .
&quot; i don &apos;t remember . &quot; well , you know what ?
it doesn &apos;t matter because you &apos;ve got the badge
and you &apos;ve got the gun .
and your prints are all over them .
you &apos;re going down for this .
let &apos;s go .
my skin is starting to crawl .
no , wait , wait .
when your guy got hit , i was inside dante &apos;s liquor .
for an hour ?
waited till it emptied out so i could rob it .
the place was crowded and full of cash on check day .
look , check it out .
the store &apos;s got cameras . they don &apos;t lie .
get in there with him .
head down to the liquor store . i wanna see that footage .
yeah .
look , you got him to talk .
peter .
you did everything you could .
are you okay ?
you &apos;re awake ?
i always wait up for you .
well , sometimes you fall asleep .
not this time .
tell me all about it .
it &apos;s classified .
oh , come on .
it &apos;s not like jill will ever find out .
i can &apos;t .
we always discuss your cases .
i know , but i -- and i can &apos;t wait to tell you about it .
but ... not until it &apos;s done .
what &apos;s so special about this one ?
i &apos;m sorry , it &apos;s --
classified .
you understand , right ?
of course i do .
i &apos;m an fbi wife .
facial recognition scan
pegged them as eric healey and robert bly .
they &apos;re both ex @-@ black ops .
they &apos;ve been freelancing
for some of our lesser known defense contractors .
they &apos;re high @-@ end mercenaries .
yeah , it does look like we &apos;re not the only ones
hunting our genius .
rival defense contractors would do anything for that technology .
i think these guys are looking to be the new sellers .
which means they &apos;re not gonna buy it .
they &apos;re gonna steal it .
hey , elizabeth burke .
bearing gifts in a brown paper bag . i can only imagine .
oh , it &apos;s just his lunch .
he forgot it this morning .
why aren &apos;t you in there ?
uh , scratched off the need to know list .
yeah , me too .
come on , let &apos;s go in .
no , neal , i &apos;m not that kind of wife .
well , i &apos;m definitely that kind of c.i.
no , i &apos;ll just leave it on his desk .
all right .
what do we think of this jill ?
there &apos;s need for further study .
i think she &apos;s lonely .
well , she lives out of an &apos; 86 chevy .
i doubt she throws a lot of dinner parties .
she never got married .
peter could be the last man she ever loved .
20 years is a long time to go without loving someone else .
you fall in love with peter , you -- you are in love .
i can &apos;t imagine those feelings ever going away .
not completely .
really ?
peter burke ? the man in the conference room ?
you have no idea .
this is good .
we &apos;ll have jones coordinate with nypd .
we &apos;ll get a current location of the suv .
he can trail it and give us updates of its whereabouts .
no . peter . i think i was pretty clear .
no one else can know anything . no one else can be involved .
it &apos;s my case , my rules .
it &apos;s our case .
i brought you in on this .
don &apos;t make me take you off .
you brought it to white collar ,
and i &apos;m asac here .
we &apos;ll do it our way or you &apos;re out .
you &apos;re not serious .
this face doesn &apos;t look serious to you ?
okay ... asac .
jones keeps tabs , he reports back to us ,
but we don &apos;t tell him why .
agreed .
i &apos;m gonna say hi to el .
yep .
did you call her ?
i did . el couldn &apos;t have been sweeter .
that &apos;s good , right ?
it &apos;s terrible .
when she &apos;s upset with me ,
she makes herself irresistible and unavailable .
oh , nice technique .
drives me crazy .
all right , go home , talk to her in person .
i can &apos;t .
jill &apos;s setting something up .
if i have to leave el mid @-@ apology to meet jill ...
so just assign a different agent to work with jill .
this case is too important .
besides , she doesn &apos;t trust anyone else .
okay .
is it about the case or is it about jill ?
i can talk to jill about losing david .
she &apos;s been through it herself .
and you don &apos;t wanna worry el any more than she already is .
i don &apos;t .
she &apos;s been through enough this year .
enough to believe that other bad things are possible .
el knows that i &apos;m in love with her .
she trusts me .
trust ?
now you see it , now you don &apos;t .
i have to go .
thing i can &apos;t talk about ?
it &apos;s going down .
you must follow him .
look , i am not following him .
i &apos;m not following my husband .
he &apos;s never given me reason not to trust him .
until now .
mozzie .
you can trust truffles
harvested in the perigord region ,
bed linens handwoven in madeira ,
and , for the most part , a teddy bear named mozart .
but people ? almost never .
you trust neal .
neal is the reason
&quot; never &quot; was preceded by &quot; almost . &quot;
i &apos;m not following peter .
you must .
i won &apos;t .
you must .
no .
then follow the woman .
or does your intrepid faith in the suit extend to her as well ?
what do you have ?
yeah , peter .
i followed the suv to the village .
they just parked and went into a restaurant .
thanks , jones . let me know when they leave .
okay .
mercenaries just went into a restaurant .
that meal should keep &apos; em on the shelf until we make the buy .
well , they &apos;re after the chip .
why stop for a meal ?
they don &apos;t know our buy &apos;s going down now .
even bad guys gotta eat .
you and the missus okay ?
she left the office in kind of a hurry .
yeah , she was just dropping by a sandwich .
sweet .
i depend on the kindness of delivery guys .
you never got married ?
who would put up with me ?
yeah ?
yeah , peter .
i &apos;ve got a bad feeling about this .
we don &apos;t have eyes on the rear .
requesting permission for a walk @-@ through .
can he just do a simple walk @-@ through ?
it &apos;s not part of the agreement .
you tell him to stand by .
don &apos;t go .
she doesn &apos;t want me to go . you do .
right .
gotcha .
i &apos;m going in .
got it .
mozzie was supposed to help me , but--
bunion removal.i heard all about it .
okay .
this is where i think she &apos;s staying .
i want you to come with me .
i hear she stays at the &apos; 86 caprice .
i saw a picture of them in front of this hotel .
close . extremely close .
and she looked smitten ,
but he looked like he wanted to go home .
because he &apos;s in love with you .
i know that .
what i don &apos;t know is her intentions with him .
i mean , he &apos;s not an ordinary man , but he is a man .
if they are there , it &apos;s for the case
and that could be dangerous .
that &apos;s why i need you .
if you don &apos;t go with me , i &apos;m gonna go alone .
wait .
i &apos;ll drive . you &apos;re too angry .
i &apos;m tired of sitting . let &apos;s go .
we &apos;re early .
we &apos;ll catch him off guard .
or tip him off .
i &apos;ve done this before , peter .
look , they &apos;re probably not even here .
okay , they &apos;re here .
that is not what it looked like .
it better not be .
you know ...
i really thought i was gonna see both of them
sitting on stools so close to each other they were touching .
you know , peter having a beer
and jill having whatever women have
when they &apos;re sitting with someone else &apos;s husband .
all right , don &apos;t jump to conclusions .
too late . already jumped .
wait at the bar .
i &apos;ll pull a room number out of the desk clerk .
if ... there is a room number .
mercenaries are gone .
they must have i.d. &apos; d us
and snuck out the back of the restaurant .
i want you to put the tac team on alert .
i &apos;m calling peter .
ssg procedure . radio silence .
okay , start tracking peter &apos;s cell phone now .
he might be walking into an ambush .
elizabeth .
neal .
a man from peter &apos;s file is in the bar .
that &apos;s why they &apos;re here . it was the case .
i told you not to jump .
i &apos;m sure peter &apos;s looking for him .
i think i could stall him .
call peter for me , okay ?
elizabeth , don &apos;t do anything--
um , are you staying at the hotel ?
i &apos;m , uh--yeah .
yeah , uh , i &apos;m staying . you ?
no . just getting a drink .
are you in a rush ?
what ?
well , sit with me .
have a drink .
um ... maybe later ?
why not now ?
i have a meeting .
um , how about you give me your phone
and i &apos;ll give you my number
and you call me in a 1 / 2 hour ?
okay .
ma &apos;am , your check .
oh , thank you .
thanks .
all right .
thanks .
promise to call ?
promise .
neal , that &apos;s him . did you get a hold of peter ?
no . voicemail .
wait here .
i need to see where they &apos;re going .
oh , no , i &apos;m coming .
all right , tell me everything that happened .
well , um , okay , i flirted with him .
he tried to flirt back , but he was not very good at it .
keep going .
he seemed anxious to leave .
he said maybe meet up in 30 minutes
and he put his number in my phone .
he put his number in your phone ?
let me see it .
what is that ?
some kind of new microchip .
all peter told me was that it &apos;s about security .
i think we found what he and jill are looking for .
shouldn &apos;t he be waiting for us ?
like you said , we &apos;re early .
he &apos;s playing it cool .
honey , i told you , it &apos;s the wrong room .
hey , i saw you the other day .
taking pictures ...
of us .
we &apos;re honeymooners .
we thought this was our room ,
but our key doesn &apos;t work ,
so i guess it isn &apos;t .
there &apos;s only one room on this end .
we don &apos;t--we don &apos;t want any trouble .
we &apos;ll just be leaving , all right ?
what &apos;s in the bag ?
nothing .
clothes .
open it .
open it , or you go from honeymooner to widow .
buyers or feds .
cash says that you &apos;re either one or the other .
third option .
we &apos;re newlyweds
who don &apos;t believe in credit cards .
he &apos;s an old @-@ fashioned kind of guy .
that i am .
i @-@ i don &apos;t know who he is ,
but she &apos;s a buyer .
the deal was supposed to go down today .
right now .
the chip !
i hid it on a woman downstairs .
what woman ?
wait . we &apos;re both buyers .
iranian interests .
well , at least i was until this morning .
north korea came calling .
our partnership wasn &apos;t gonna make it past the parking garage .
son of a bitch .
their country would be very grateful
if the two of you joined our team .
extremely grateful .
look , kill the both of them .
you can take the money .
i &apos;ll cut you in on my half of the chip .
just untie me .
all right , you have to go downstairs .
i have the chip .
i &apos;m going in .
give it to me . i &apos;ll take it in .
are you gonna help me get in there ,
or am i gonna have to knock ?
let &apos;s discuss this .
i don &apos;t know who you &apos;re working for
or what they &apos;re paying you ,
but the north koreans will beat it .
they can &apos;t even feed their own people .
shut up .
what are you looking for , newlywed ?
all right .
you never saw this .
what is that ?
it &apos;s something mozzie and i made .
now go in there like you own the place .
show them the chip , but keep it away from them .
okay , try to buy me 30 seconds .
careful .
i asked you a question , newlywed .
i &apos;ve got what you want .
hon , get out of here now .
th--that &apos;s her .
that &apos;s the woman i stashed the chip on .
he &apos;s right .
it &apos;s , uh--it &apos;s in here .
it &apos;s , um--i have it .
it &apos;s , um--it &apos;s , uh ...
it &apos;s--it &apos;s right here . it &apos;s--it &apos;s in the phone case .
fbi .
oh , that was incredible .
but don &apos;t do anything like that again .
i don &apos;t know if i can promise that .
all right , we got two men down .
another typical day at white collar .
well , i fulfilled one of my fondest dreams .
yeah , what &apos;s that ?
working with you .
it was fun .
we did talk about that at quantico a lot .
it lived up to expectations .
but you had bigger dreams back then .
washington .
soon ?
once i &apos;ve tied up all the loose ends here .
yeah .
i can &apos;t just bring anyone in to be neal &apos;s handler .
i gotta make sure they &apos;re up to the task .
peter .
what ?
there &apos;ll always be loose ends .
yeah .
yeah , and there &apos;s one you might be able to help me with .
uh , this one is a cold case
that has been gnawing at me for 20 years .
why california ?
you were top in our class .
you could have had any assignment you wanted .
i took an assignment .
first female ssg agent on the west coast .
how could i turn that down ?
i wouldn &apos;t have stopped you .
you wanted new york . d.c. that was your dream .
you ran .
you didn &apos;t chase after me .
you would have just run faster .
you &apos;re right . i would have .
at least this way we can remember quantico
as the beautiful thing it was .
let &apos;s do that .
where you headed ?
off to miami . another case .
well , i hope another case brings you to new york again .
yeah , maybe i &apos;ll bring my el with me .
male edition .
good luck finding one .
she &apos;s one in a million .
don &apos;t be afraid to talk to her , peter .
about anything .
i should have talked to you about this a long time ago ,
but i can &apos;t stop thinking about him .
i can &apos;t shake the feeling that if i hadn &apos;t become asac
he &apos;d still be alive .
just trust me , okay ?
can i open my eyes ?
no , you can &apos;t .
step down--curb . curb . curb .
there you go .
it &apos;s not that big of a curb .
i don &apos;t like surprises . they never turn out good .
all right , we &apos;re almost there .
you know , you should know that
walking the streets of new york blind
is a recurring nightmare of mine .
you can open your eyes .
it &apos;s the window from the codex .
how did you ever find it ?
agent gruetzner used some of his underworld contacts .
it &apos;s beautiful .
not professional .
no .
not professional at all .
