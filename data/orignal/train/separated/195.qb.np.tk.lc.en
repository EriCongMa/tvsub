gossip girl here ...
your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
we have to see this through to the end .
this is the end , chuck .
i didn &apos;t know you were applying to the tisch writing program .
i &apos;m kinda not telling anyone .
that doesn &apos;t give you the right to tell me who i can and can &apos;t see .
with carter , yes , it does .
i just got another call from my p.i. about your dad .
he has his exact location , just a 3 @-@ hour plane ride away .
do you know where nate is ?
um , no , i don &apos;t see him right now .
if you find him ,
can you just please tell him to call me back as soon as he can ?
serena left with carter .
uh , cece . hi , it &apos;s rufus .
i don &apos;t know where you and lily are ,
but i know it &apos;s not canyon ranch .
hello ? dad ?
serena .
on the upper east side ,
new days don &apos;t always bring new beginnings ,
but they almost always bring new surprises .
oh , god . waffles .
you don &apos;t like waffles ?
it &apos;s not a matter of like .
it &apos;s ... it &apos;s i &apos;m a humphrey , so syrup is a food group .
yeah , how are you not , like , 500 pounds ?
nice shirt , by the way .
oh . yeah , sorry . i , uh , it looked really comfy to sleep in .
oh , yeah , it &apos;s serena &apos;s favorite as well .
so you still haven &apos;t heard from her ?
nope .
radio silence since she left with carter .
i &apos;m not gonna be the first one to call her , you know ?
thanks for letting me crash here last night .
i &apos;m sorry you had to sleep on the couch .
i have no idea how it got so late .
well , time flies when you &apos;re having
a wii tennis death match , humphrey .
oh , did you call your dad , by the way ?
uh , yeah , but i said that i was staying at sawyer &apos;s ,
so if anyone asks , you &apos;re an insecure brunette
who has an unnatural love for designer handbags .
um , hey , are we still on
for the tim burton exhibit at moma ?
absolutely .
oh , it &apos;s serena .
&quot; just landed . so sorry . call you when i &apos;m home . &quot;
you know what ? i think i &apos;m gonna ... i think i &apos;m gonna shower
and just go over there .
um , are you sure ?
i mean , she said she was gonna call you .
you don &apos;t ... you don &apos;t wanna push , right ?
yeah , i think ... just ... if we talk , it should be in person .
rain check on moma ?
sure .
you ready ?
to explain to rufus the real reason
i &apos;ve been lying to him ? no .
but i know i have to .
well , it &apos;s rufus . he &apos;ll understand .
yeah , let &apos;s hope .
you know , it &apos;s hard enough to tell him ,
but now with your father involved ...
william and rufus do not exactly get along .
mm , nothing like a grunge @-@ era love triangle .
yes , well , complete with an unplanned pregnancy ,
a trip to a french sanatorium , my mother
and a whole lot of flannel .
it was ugly in more ways than one .
well , it &apos;ll be okay , mom . i &apos;m here for you .
it &apos;s a lot easier to sneak up on someone
when you &apos;re not eight months pregnant .
and they &apos;re not standing in front of a full @-@ length mirror .
are the caterers all set up downstairs ?
uh , yes . everything is set up .
miss blair , i not so sure this party your best idea .
what if we go feed ducks in park , just the two of us ?
dorota , why did i go to the trouble
of putting together an elegant brunch and inviting
a dozen of manhattan &apos;s most eligible bachelors ?
so world can know miss blair &apos;s single again ,
and chuck bass thing of past .
but miss blair not yet grieve properly .
to rush back into dating ...
will show everyone that chuck bass has no hold over me .
dorota , you really need to stop buying your prenatal vitamins
over the internet .
for this i postpone honeymoon .
will you toss out that box of junk ?
i never want to see it again .
lily ?
hello , rufus .
will , what the hell are you doing here ?
i &apos;m here to see lily . is she home ?
if she was , you still wouldn &apos;t be welcome .
you need to leave now .
i &apos;m afraid i can &apos;t do that .
yeah , i know about this summer .
you &apos;ve done enough damage to this family , on all fronts .
this summer .
she , uh , she hasn &apos;t told you ?
told me what ?
i think we should wait for lily .
we a all have a lot to talk about .
there is an outlet by the bed ,
and i will be in in a minute .
you look like hell .
small price to pay to feel like heaven .
where &apos;s archibald ?
don &apos;t tell me you two finally
closed the deal .
i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about , chuck .
please . you &apos;ve been panting at his loafers
ever since serena went m.i.a. with carter .
was it as you always imagined ?
late night ?
you two engaged in a sweaty wii duel ...
your bodies touch ...
he looks at you like he &apos;s never looked at you before .
oh , you &apos;re an ass , chuck . besides , serena &apos;s back .
oh , well , maybe now you &apos;ll actually have a chance .
don &apos;t worry .
the odds of me remembering this conversation are slim .
wait . what do you mean , i &apos;ll stand a chance now ?
archibald &apos;s never gonna cross the line .
he &apos;s a good guy .
he would cling to serena &apos;s golden locks
until she pushes him away .
yeah , but why would she do that ?
i mean , he &apos;s been totally patient and understanding .
you and i know that ,
but if she were to think nate had , in fact , betrayed her ,
she would drive him into your waiting arms in no time .
why are you telling me all this ?
because ... if i want my friend back ,
this would be done easier with serena out of the picture .
now all you need is something to make her suspicious .
lily told me that she renovated this place again .
it &apos;s come a long way since we first moved in .
there have been a lot of improvements since you left ,
which is why you won &apos;t be staying .
lily .
oh . rufus , hello . mmm .
oh , god . william .
dad ?
serena .
paging serena van der woodsen .
after a lifetime in the daddy waiting room ,
it looks like the doctor is finally in .
william , what &apos;s going on ?
i was just about to ask you that , lily .
rufus , um ,
it wasn &apos;t my mother who was sick .
it was me .
and that &apos;s why william and i were together last summer .
uh , he wasn &apos;t treating cece .
he was treating me .
mom said that &apos;s why you wouldn &apos;t see me
when i came looking for you .
i wanted to see you , but as her doctor ,
i couldn &apos;t tell you why i was there ,
and i @-@ i didn &apos;t wanna lie .
how are you feeling now ?
good . i &apos;m feeling good .
and i just had my 6 @-@ month checkup ,
and , uh , we &apos;ll get the results soon .
yeah , well , the one bright spot
is that lily &apos;s illness is very treatable .
we &apos;re just waiting on the last round of test results ,
but , uh , i &apos;m highly optimistic that it hasn &apos;t returned .
hmm . lily , i &apos;m so sorry you &apos;ve been , uh ,
going through this ... alone .
i would just like to move forward
as if everything is normal .
and , uh , just please keep this between us .
and there will be no mention of the &quot; c &quot; word in this house .
and i am gonna go freshen up .
lily , you ... you and i still need to talk .
yeah .
uh , my family and i need some time alone .
sure .
listen , i , uh ,
know that this is a lot for you to take in .
can i convince you to go somewhere and talk ?
if eric &apos;s around , i would love for him to join us .
he &apos;s in andover with the debate team .
but , um , let me just change .
where ... where should i meet you ?
i &apos;m at 60 thompson .
you okay ?
yeah .
after all he &apos;s done for my mom ,
i at least owe him a conversation .
mm .
&quot; we regret to inform you
that due to the high volume of qualified applicants ,
the dramatic writing program at the tisch school of the arts ... &quot;
we , uh , have decided to crush your dreams
with this form letter .
apparently , there was ... there &apos;s only one spot
for transfer students , and i didn &apos;t get it , so ...
this is really terrible .
no , vanessa , it &apos;s , uh , it &apos;s okay .
i mean , it sucks , yeah , but i &apos;ll survive .
no , it &apos;s not that .
it &apos;s just ...
it was me .
i , um , i got the spot .
what ?
i should have told you i was applying
for dramatic writing as well as film and tv .
i just ... i honestly didn &apos;t think i had a shot .
it was only after i wrote that short that i started thinking
how great would it be if we both got in ?
wait . so ... so you got the spot ?
i would have never applied
if i &apos;d had known they were only taking one transfer from n.y.u.
you got in .
well , i mean , congratulations .
no , seriously , seriously ,
if it wasn &apos;t gonna be me , um ,
i &apos;m glad it was you .
you are ?
yeah , sure , you know ,
and they ... they also &quot; wish me success in my future endeavors . &quot;
so it &apos;s not a total loss .
listen , i gotta get to a @-@ a study group ,
but , um , i don &apos;t know . i think we should celebrate .
there &apos;s an art party tonight in bushwick .
it should be tisch student central .
what do you say ?
are you sure ?
please . come on . ain &apos;t no party like a bushwick party .
i &apos;ll call you later . all right .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
i don &apos;t know .
you have every right to be mad at me .
i don &apos;t want to be mad . i ...
i just want to understand .
lily ... talk to me .
i was scared .
i was more scared than i &apos;ve ever been .
and telling you ,
having to see the look on your face ...
i couldn &apos;t bear it .
and then when will said that the minute
people start treating you like you &apos;re sick ...
especially your loved ones ...
that your body starts to listen to it , and i ...
i guess i just used that as an excuse .
um ... because i knew the minute i told you ,
it would all become so real .
so , uh , will told you not to tell me ?
everything that he has done
and everything that he has said has worked .
i know , and that &apos;s all that &apos;s important .
was i not clear ?
did i not instruct you to send out invitations to my bachelors
with the date , time and location clearly marked ?
i did . all invitations go out .
then how do you explain this ?
did you send the invitations by carrier pigeon ?
i ... is the elevator broken ? a meteor headed for earth ?
you were against this from the start .
what did you do ?
i do nothing .
then i don &apos;t understand .
you .
you . come here .
you &apos;re a guy .
i invited a dozen eligible bachelors today ,
and not one of them showed up .
you &apos;d be thrilled to date me , wouldn &apos;t you ?
yeah . you &apos;re totally hot .
miss blair . please .
maybe this is sign .
i remember when i separate from first husband ...
dorota , i need answers
that don &apos;t end in &quot; and then i came to america . &quot;
wait . what did you say ?
um , first husband ?
oh . of course .
chuck .
what is mr. chuck to do with this ?
isn &apos;t it obvious ?
he &apos;s declared a dating fatwa on me .
serena . hey .
w ... when did you get back ?
i just got in , and by the looks of it , so did you .
yeah . i , um , i spent the night at a friend &apos;s house .
so what &apos;s up ?
uh , for starters ,
i &apos;m about to go see my father .
your father ? wow . that &apos;s amazing .
yeah . look , jenny , i would
love to catch up , but i gotta run .
yeah .
is that ...
is that nate &apos;s shirt ?
what ? no .
you spent the night at a friend &apos;s ?
look , serena ,
i kinda crashed at nate &apos;s last night ,
but we were just hanging out ,
and we totally lost track of time .
i mean , he slept on the couch .
like , you have to believe me .
you ... you do , right ?
yeah , of course .
look , my ... my dad is waiting .
here . you &apos;ll probably see him before i do .
yeah .
dan ! i &apos;m glad i ran into you .
oh , hi .
are you okay ?
oh , so i ... i take it you heard ?
i &apos;m so sorry .
i was really looking forward to you being at tisch next year .
honestly , i never really thought she &apos;d get it .
wait . so even you knew
that vanessa was applying ?
and you didn &apos;t .
wow . that hurts .
yeah , on a few levels ,
like the fact that her submission
was based on my story
in &quot; the new yorker , &quot; but ...
yeah , whatever .
dan , you know submissions have to be original works , right ?
well , i mean , i &apos;m ... i &apos;m sure she didn &apos;t do it on purpose .
it &apos;s fine . if i &apos;m not gonna get in ,
it might as well go to vanessa , you know ?
you know how my dad &apos;s on the board of directors , right ?
he told me you were the runner @-@ up ,
that it came down to you and vanessa .
wh ... you &apos;re kidding .
that was your spot . the school has to know .
no , i &apos;m not gonna do that to her .
she &apos;s my girlfriend .
you know , she got in , and i just ...
i have to deal with it .
uh , so i &apos;ll see you later ?
you &apos;re ... you &apos;re performing at that party in bushwick , right ?
yeah , but ...
all right , okay , well , i &apos;ll see you then .
hi , daddy . it &apos;s me .
hey . you just called me .
why didn &apos;t you answer ?
and what are you doing here ?
call me crazy .
i thought we should talk in person .
but you &apos;re obviously on your way out .
i &apos;m going to meet with my father .
whoa . since when ? what &apos;s he doing here ?
it &apos;s ... it &apos;s complicated .
i know that &apos;s not what you want to hear right now ,
but if you could just wait ...
i &apos;ve been waiting , serena .
yeah , and were you waiting alone ,
or was someone there to keep you company ?
what are you talking about ?
nothing . you know what ? just ... just keep your secrets , nate .
you &apos;re accusing me of keeping secrets ?
are you kidding me ?
can we not do this right now ?
i have a lot going on .
yeah , and my guess is you &apos;re not
gonna tell me about any of it .
i can &apos;t . i just ...
i need you to understand that .
yeah , yeah , and you &apos;re gonna tell me everything later .
i &apos;ve heard it before . you know what ?
this time i &apos;m not gonna hold my breath .
prep the o.r. , kiddies .
looks like jenny humphrey is scrubbing up
to surgically remove a boyfriend .
so what &apos;s step two ?
get him drunk .
take advantage of him .
do women just not get this ?
chuck , he &apos;s not gonna go drinking with me .
he made me call my dad when i slept over .
be here . 6 : 00 sharp .
and look like someone who doesn &apos;t even have a father .
you twisted , manipulative psychopath .
how could you ?
you &apos;re going to have to be a tad more specific .
it &apos;s been a busy few days .
my party .
right . i heard about your little rebound reception .
good for you , moving on .
so you &apos;re just gonna pretend like you have nothing to do
with the fact that no one showed up ?
that you didn &apos;t put a dating fatwa on me ?
we &apos;re over , chuck . unclench .
to set the record straight , i didn &apos;t put a fatwa on you .
the reason no one showed up today is
because no one could ever measure up to what we had ,
and i &apos;m obviously not the only guy who knows that .
fine . if you won &apos;t move on , i will .
there are plenty of guys outside the upper east side ,
and by this time tomorrow , everyone in the five boroughs
will know that chuck bass &apos; threats mean nothing .
willa , hey . what &apos;s up ? thank you .
i &apos;m about to head out to bushwick ,
get a vibe on the space tonight .
but i told my dad john about vanessa &apos;s submission .
the dean is gonna call for a review of her application .
she &apos;ll be rejected , and you &apos;ll be in .
you did what ?
can &apos;t talk . gotta go tune my instrument .
no , no , no . willa ...
we &apos;ll celebrate tonight .
no , willa , don &apos;t ... don &apos;t hang ...
and suddenly i found myself
caught in the middle of a civil war in the congo .
wait . when was that ?
well , that was , uh , after hurricane mitch
and before kosovo , so &apos; 98 , &apos; 99 .
you know , my , uh , my &apos; 98 was , uh , actually pretty similar .
we were just coming out of the civil war
between lily and the republic of claus .
what do you say we get out of here , go to serendipity ?
i remember how much you used to love their banana splits .
i was 4 .
you &apos;re right .
i shouldn &apos;t presume to even know you .
you know , this gulf ,
this chasm that &apos;s between us ...
it &apos;s gonna take some time , but ...
we can make it go away .
you may be here for my mom now ,
but that doesn &apos;t explain the last 14 years .
you just left .
it ... it wasn &apos;t ...
exactly like that .
then what was it like ?
thank you .
i &apos;m glad you called . how are you doing ?
i &apos;m okay . i &apos;m okay .
listen , um , do you remember how tisch required you
to submit an original piece ?
tell me about it . i was so stressed ,
and then the night before the application was due ,
it just came to me .
oh , what came to you ?
um , i would love for you to read it .
uh , what is this ?
it &apos;s my piece for the application ...
my first original play .
it &apos;s your first original ? oh , wow .
and while it &apos;s not based on anything you &apos;ve written ,
it was based on you . on us , really .
i don &apos;t know what to say .
i can &apos;t watch you read ,
so i &apos;m gonna head back to the dorms .
but why don &apos;t we just skip the party
and order pizza ?
okay . sounds good .
well , the plan was to find a new home base
so i could get us all out of here .
what , you ... you wanted us to come ?
of course .
that was the plan .
so i took the post in tibet .
i tried to commute while i got settled in .
c @-@ commute from tibet to j.f.k. ?
yeah . and i promised your mother
that i would be home on a tuesday
and i would show up on friday , the following week .
it didn &apos;t take long before she , um ...
wanted a divorce , yeah .
you know , i couldn &apos;t blame her
for needing consistency in her life , in your lives .
serena , i just don &apos;t want you to think that one day i woke up
and decided that i was gonna leave you
and never come back .
after a while ,
i just didn &apos;t know how .
so that &apos;s it ?
you just forgot how to be a father ?
last name &apos;s van der woodsen .
let him know he has a visitor .
if you &apos;ll excuse me for a moment ...
i &apos;ve got plenty of fresh towels , rufus ,
but thanks for checking in .
i &apos;m actually here to make sure you check out .
okay , um ,
you don &apos;t trust me . i get it .
if i were going by the me of 20 years ago ,
i wouldn &apos;t trust myself either , but , uh , people change ,
rufus .
really ? because telling lily to hide her illness
from me and the kids is just like the guy i used to know .
lily needed to remain positive . and if i may say , it worked .
well , for that , i &apos;m eternally grateful ,
but now that i &apos;m part of this ,
she gets a new doctor ,
one i can be certain has only one agenda .
rufus , what are you doing here ?
oh , i &apos;m sorry for intruding .
i &apos;ll see you at home .
wait . i &apos;ll ... i &apos;ll come with you .
serena .
i just need some time to think .
okay ?
this is willa . leave me a message .
willa , you need to call you father
and have him undo whatever it was he did
before the dean calls vanessa , because it would be ...
it &apos;d be a ...
humphrey .
i ... i &apos;ll call you . what do you want , blair ?
i &apos;m about to explain , so if you &apos;d remain silent
until you hear the full story , i &apos;d appreciate it .
th ... this is really not a good time .
wow . i &apos;m not even close to done .
okay , so chuck has put a dating fatwa on me .
so unless i find some guy to kiss me
so i can splash it all over &quot; gossip girl , &quot;
i might as well just pack up and join a convent .
i need a night out away from the upper east side ,
away from manhattan , actually .
well , there ... there was this art party that vanessa and i
were gonna go to , but i ...
a party where you two are guests ... perfect .
brimming with young men who are not socially astute enough
to fear the length of the bass arm .
blair , i have more important things right now to ...
um ... you know what ? actually , i &apos;m sorry .
there is someone at that party that i need to talk to .
wonderful .
now i &apos;ll need a disguise if i &apos;m to blend in .
perhaps vanessa can loan me a serape ?
serena , stuff between me and your dad
goes a long way back , but don &apos;t let that get in the way
of your relationship with him .
i ... i won &apos;t .
right now i just need to keep things about my mom ,
think about what &apos;s best for her .
i &apos;ll see you soon .
uh , that was william ,
and , um , he got the test results .
they &apos;re not what we hoped .
art party . brooklyn .
she wasn &apos;t kidding .
$ 500 it is .
i know an r.a.
can use the money .
well , you look like you could use a drink .
what &apos;s your problem ?
you know what you did to blair .
and i &apos;m paying for it .
yeah , seems like you &apos;re having the time of your life .
after all these years ,
you can &apos;t see through one of my smoke screens ?
i &apos;m not asking for forgiveness , nathaniel .
i did what i did .
but we have been best friends
since before i can remember , and i thought ...
i know serena went with carter ,
and i know she &apos;s back .
i just thought you could use a drink ,
maybe get out of the city ...
even if it &apos;s with me .
yeah . getting out of the city sounds like a good idea .
what do you have in mind ?
brooklyn , actually .
and i invited along a local guide .
you guys ready ?
by midnight , everyone who reads &quot; gossip girl &quot;
will see me kissing some guy ,
chuck &apos;s fatwa will kaput ,
and i &apos;ll have my life back .
are you sure you wanna be here ?
yeah . i mean , it &apos;s not fair what chuck &apos;s doing to her ,
and i really don &apos;t want this
tisch thing to come between us .
me neither .
okay , i &apos;m gonna go find my sacrificial lamb and the bar .
um , i should follow her ,
because i do not want her to spill on my leather leggings .
i &apos;ll get some drinks .
i don &apos;t know why you invited jenny .
what , i thought you two were as thick as wiis .
yeah , but not for a night out drinking .
i mean , she &apos;s still just a kid .
she &apos;s a junior , older than serena when the two of you
christened the campbell apartment .
and honestly ,
does she look like a kid to you ?
so ...
columbia ? i &apos;m impressed .
this doesn &apos;t really seem like an ivy league party .
what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m friends with the guy who owns the loft .
oh , god . is that an aaron rose ?
uh , pretty sure that &apos;s ikea .
not bad , columbia .
name &apos;s cameron .
blair .
is it suddenly unbearably hot in here ?
oh , are you okay ?
i &apos;m better now .
thank you .
willa .
dan . you &apos;re just in time .
i &apos;m about to serve up a venti @-@ sized serving
of artistic justice .
please tell me
that you got one of my 200 messages .
nope . told you i was getting in the zone .
were you calling to thank me ?
uh , vanessa submitted an original piece ,
so you need to tell your dad that
there &apos;s been a mistake .
so she wrote something else .
are you telling me she belongs at tisch more than you ?
you deserve it .
you can thank me later .
i &apos;m ... i &apos;m with vanessa .
you &apos;re &quot; with &quot; vanessa ? what are you , 40 ?
hi , dan .
who was that slut ?
just call your father .
hey , jenny . jenny !
please tell me what you &apos;re doing here ,
starting with &quot; dad knows &quot;
and ending with &quot; these drinks are not for me . &quot;
since i haven &apos;t actually talked to dad today , no .
but these drinks are for nate and chuck .
what are you doing with nate and chuck ?
well , nate &apos;s my friend , and chuck &apos;s totally harmless
unless this place runs out of ice .
um , does vanessa know that girl
who was hitting on you ?
no , she wasn &apos;t ... wait a second .
why do you go from zero to blackmail in 60 seconds ?
dan , it was actually a question .
a relapse is not uncommon .
we just need another round of treatment ,
make some adjustments . that &apos;s all .
no .
rufus ...
i think we need a second opinion .
we &apos;re at the epicenter of the best medical care
in the world , and whatever we need to do ,
we can do it together , here .
if that &apos;s what you want , lily , of course .
i mean , i &apos;ll call a friend at sloan @-@ kettering myself .
but , uh , even if you do go with another doctor ,
i &apos;m gonna stick around , because i need to know you &apos;re well .
i think we should stay with dad .
he &apos;s already cured mom once ,
and ... and he is family .
i think i prefer it , too , rufus .
he &apos;s already familiar with every aspect of my case ,
and i know what to expect of the treatment ,
and serena &apos;s right . william is family .
sure . if that &apos;s what you want , of course .
i &apos;ll make some calls .
we &apos;ll get started first thing tomorrow .
and , like rufus says ,
we &apos;re , uh , all in this together .
hey . i wasn &apos;t expecting you .
is this a bad time ? i kinda need to talk .
no , no . it &apos;s fine . are you okay ?
um , things aren &apos;t really going so well .
chuck wants us to do shots .
is that jenny ?
yeah , we &apos;re ... we &apos;re sort of at this party .
hey , uh ... it &apos;s serena .
i can &apos;t believe this .
why ? what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing . it &apos;s just i called to talk to you ,
and you &apos;re at a party with ... with jenny humphrey ?
well , so what ? it &apos;s no big deal .
just like her spending the night wasn &apos;t a big deal ?
what ? how do you know about that ?
you know what ? never mind . i changed my mind .
i don &apos;t have anything to say to you .
ser ...
chuck , your plan sucks .
he &apos;s on the phone with serena right now .
that &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
i &apos;m so over this party .
let &apos;s just go back to the suite and get hammered .
you two run along . i &apos;m gonna stick around for a while .
you up for it ?
absolutely .
spotted ... nate archibald suffering from a broken heart .
too bad he doesn &apos;t realize
jenny &apos;s oath is less hippocratic
and more hypocrite .
come on . you &apos;re an art history major .
wh ... admit it .
this art is atrocious .
oh , i don &apos;t know . the ikea orb &apos;s growing on me .
actually , i have a friend who goes to columbia ,
though i don &apos;t think
he attends that many classes .
blair , do you want to make that guy
who showed up jealous or what ?
excuse me ?
i saw you two . let me guess ... your ex @-@ boyfriend ?
you want to prove to him you &apos;re over him ,
ready to move on ?
just have to take the plunge .
show him the past is the past .
i like you . i &apos;m game if you are .
i &apos;m game .
vanessa , where are you going ?
home .
look , i don &apos;t know what willa told you , but keep in mind ,
she ... she carries around lighter fluid .
you told her that my tisch sample
was adapted from your story ?
it slipped out .
but you wrote an original piece ,
so you don &apos;t have anything to worry about .
you mean because willa &apos;s gonna call her father
and straighten it out with the dean ?
thanks , dan . you really made sure i was off to a great start .
you &apos;re not ... you &apos;re not being fair . that was not my fault .
i asked you if you were okay with me getting in .
why weren &apos;t you honest with me ?
like you were honest with me ,
going behind my back to apply for the one thing
i wanted more than anything ?
i explained that .
no . no , you justified that .
you said yourself that if you knew there &apos;d only been one spot ,
you wouldn &apos;t have applied .
what are you ... what are you saying ?
you want me to withdraw my application ?
no .
no . no , of course not .
but what were you expecting my reaction to be ?
i , um , i don &apos;t know .
not this .
you &apos;re taking off ?
i want to get started first thing tomorrow .
there &apos;s no time to waste .
i @-@ i still don &apos;t know what i want from you .
you know , today i was
planning on giving you a big speech on regret ,
but , uh , your mother &apos;s illness ,
her reaching out to me ,
us reconnecting ...
i have to believe there &apos;s a purpose behind all of this .
but you &apos;ve missed so much .
i know . um ...
i &apos;ve followed you from afar ,
glimpsed a photo here and there .
wasn &apos;t thrilled about that horse at the polo match .
that was sort of the point .
thank you , serena .
i know you have no reason to trust or believe me ,
so , uh , i really appreciate the second chance .
everyone deserves one .
well , i &apos;m not sure rufus would necessarily agree with that ,
but , uh ,
for what it &apos;s worth , i plan to prove him wrong .
i haven &apos;t read any posts on &quot; gossip girl &quot; yet .
i guess my ban works in the provinces .
i knew it . i knew you &apos;d fatwa &apos;d me .
and i knew you couldn &apos;t break it .
you &apos;re wrong . i could have .
then why didn &apos;t you ?
because ...
i suddenly realized it .
the way to get over you
isn &apos;t by hooking up with some random guy
or pretending like we didn &apos;t happen .
you and i loved each other .
and then you broke my heart .
i &apos;ve been doing everything possible not to face that fact .
i &apos;m gonna kiss somebody someday ,
and when i do ,
it &apos;ll be for me .
good @-@ bye , chuck .
i &apos;m going home .
what the hell is wrong with me ?
nothing &apos;s wrong with you .
i mean , don &apos;t you know how great you are ?
i &apos;m serious . i mean ... look , i probably shouldn &apos;t say this ,
but you &apos;ve said it to me once before ...
you deserve someone who &apos;s gonna treat you right ,
not like serena does .
it &apos;s true .
i mean i would never treat you like she does .
you deserve better , nate .
jenny , no .
in case you &apos;ve never heard one before ...
nate ?
that &apos;s the sound of a relationship flatlining .
i know what this looks like .
oh , you do ? great . well , as long as you know
how it looks , then ... then i guess i &apos;m good .
that &apos;s not what i meant . stop . hey .
i mean , what are you even doing here ?
i came to apologize for not hearing you out earlier ,
and then i walk in to see her trying to kiss you ?
yeah , but i didn &apos;t . nothing happened .
same as nothing happened last night ,
which i would have told you about ,
if you hadn &apos;t hung up on me .
well , so what about all the things she said about me ?
is ... is that really what you think ?
yes , he does .
i &apos;m talking to nate , jenny .
well ?
what , do i wonder why you don &apos;t trust me anymore ?
yeah , i do .
you don &apos;t tell me you are looking for your dad .
and then you leave town with carter baizen .
and then you come back and you shut me out .
what am i supposed to think ?
i &apos;m sorry . i should have told you
that i was looking for my father .
but i didn &apos;t leave town with carter .
you know that .
i even tried to apologize .
what are you talking about ?
the night of dorota &apos;s wedding ,
i ... i called your cell to explain everything .
i even left a message with jenny .
what message ?
i never talked to her , nate .
for once , please , don &apos;t let her do this to you .
i left you a message , nate .
she said she would tell you .
she &apos;s lying ! i never talked to her .
just get out .
what ?
seriously , jenny , just please leave .
you know , you two deserve each other .
oh , sorry , miss blair .
i forget to take away .
i ... i know you not want to see anymore .
hey , no . give me that .
it &apos;s no use to deny the past .
chuck is a part of me .
he &apos;ll always be .
it just hurts so much .
in poland , we have a saying ...
&quot; love is like head wound . &quot;
it make you dizzy , you think you die ...
but you recover ...
usually .
that &apos;s a terrible saying .
tomorrow can we feed the ducks ?
i already buy bread .
sorry . i had to talk to my mom first .
nate , before i ... i tell you what i need to tell you ,
i want you to know that i do trust you .
and if i &apos;m guilty of anything ,
it &apos;s taking you for granted ,
for assuming you &apos;d always be around .
and i ... i promise ,
i ... i won &apos;t do that again .
serena , what &apos;s ... what &apos;s going on ?
to revive a struggling relationship ,
there comes a point
when we must stop protecting what we have ...
the reason i couldn &apos;t talk to you earlier ...
it &apos;s ... it &apos;s not about my dad . it was about my mom .
she &apos;s sick ,
and i don &apos;t know what &apos;s gonna happen .
to allow for what we truly need .
moving forward can mean reaching out ...
reaching back or reaching balance .
thank you , rufus .
i know william being back is hard for you .
all that matters is you getting better .
and while new journeys can start with a single step ,
they can end just as quickly with a single misstep .
hey , vanessa . it &apos;s me .
listen , i just read your play , and it &apos;s , uh , it &apos;s amazing .
i &apos;m so , so sorry . please call me .
and when even the healthiest relationship
finds itself on life support , it &apos;s important to remember ...
it &apos;s will . it &apos;s not working exactly as i &apos;d hoped .
i need you to write lily another prescription .
well , you can &apos;t back out now . i need you to make this work .
and i doubt the authorities
would be pleased to know what you &apos;ve been doing .
on the upper east side ,
sometimes the wrong prescription
is just what the doctor ordered .
