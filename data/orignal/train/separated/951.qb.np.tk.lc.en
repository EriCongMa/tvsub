第三季 第十一集
i will love her like she is my own .
&lt; i &gt; lynette made a promise . &lt; / i &gt;
his wife goes missing , his mistress turns up dead ?
i can &apos;t believe that orson could do such a thing .
&lt; i &gt; mike got arrested . &lt; / i &gt;
oh , thank god .
&lt; i &gt; a friendship hit the rocks . &lt; / i &gt;
i am not playing with a woman
that will let mike take the fall for her psycho husband .
&lt; i &gt; susan made a deal . &lt; / i &gt;
i &apos;ll hire the best lawyer in town
on one condition . you can &apos;t see him anymore .
&lt; i &gt; and the missing wife returned . &lt; / i &gt;
hello , alma .
&lt; i &gt; to understand the journey of alma hodge , &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; you first need to know how it started . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; it began the day she wed orson hodge , &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; a man she had tricked into marriage by getting pregnant . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; alma was confident &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; that as their family grew , &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; orson &apos;s feelings for her would grow as well . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; but then something went wrong , &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; and the baby she had been counting on never came . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; so alma found herself married to a man &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; who seemed to despise her . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; still , alma hoped things would get better . &lt; / i &gt;
mama loves her baby . does the baby love mama ?
&lt; i &gt; until the day she discovered orson was having an affair . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; and alma realized &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; the only way she &apos;d ever get her husband to appreciate her &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; was to leave him ... immediately . &lt; / i &gt;
if you don &apos;t get back in your cage right now ,
i &apos;m going to have to leave you behind ! please .
going somewhere ?
i &apos;m staying at a motel tonight .
why ?
i don &apos;t have time to discuss it .
i &apos;m late for the bus .
all right .
i &apos;m going away because ...
i know you &apos;re having an affair .
i see .
aren &apos;t you even gonna deny it ?
on the contrary , i want to shout it from the rooftops .
for the first time in my life , i &apos;m actually in love .
how could you say that to me ? i &apos;m your wife !
we both know why we got married .
and it had nothing to do with affection .
so you don &apos;t care if i go ?
no .
wait ! this isn &apos;t what &apos;s supposed to happen !
you should be begging me to stay with you .
i deserve to be happy , alma . so do you .
and we &apos;re clearly not gonna find that together .
orson , no !
&lt; i &gt; it was at that moment alma realized &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; it wasn &apos;t enough to leave her husband . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; he had to be punished . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; yes , this was the journey of alma hodge . &lt; / i &gt;
bree hodge ? i &apos;m alma hodge .
i believe we have someone in common .
&lt; i &gt; and it wasn &apos;t over yet . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; there is a time of day all housewives look forward to . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; it occurs just after the chores have been completed &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; and right before the children come home from school . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; it &apos;s a time for good friends to get together , &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; have a cup of coffee , &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; and exchange gossip about the other good friends &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; who couldn &apos;t make it that day . &lt; / i &gt;
bree let orson move back in .
you &apos;re kidding . when ?
yesterday .
i &apos;m so disappointed in her .
well , the police did arrest mike .
i know you think he &apos;s innocent ,
but you can understand why bree &apos;s feelings have changed .
well , mine haven &apos;t .
and i know something that bree probably doesn &apos;t .
when orson was 17 , he spent time in a mental institution .
how did you find that out ?
i snuck into his office and rifled through his things .
of course you did .
it doesn &apos;t prove he &apos;d anything to do with monique &apos;s murder .
no , but it &apos;s a piece of the puzzle .
i mean , he did have an affair with her .
and when you combine that with the fact
that his first wife went missing ...
so you &apos;re alma . where have you been all this time ?
in canada . my aunt lives there .
well , you should have told someone .
people thought you were dead .
some even thought that orson killed you .
well , that &apos;s sort of what i wanted them to think .
that &apos;s why i left my bird behind and only took cash ,
so they couldn &apos;t trace me through my credit cards .
so you deliberately framed orson ?
i &apos;m not saying it was my finest hour .
but you have to understand , orson hurt me very badly .
he cheated on me .
yes , i know , with monique polier .
and i thought if i disappeared ,
she &apos;d get scared and leave him ,
like he left me .
isn &apos;t jealousy awful ?
so why have you come back ?
i found this fantastic therapist .
he told me that by holding on to my anger ,
i was really hurting myself , which was hard to deny .
i mean , hello , i &apos;m here in winnipeg with a deaf aunt
and no credit .
so i thought ... it &apos;s time to make amends .
darling , mrs. mclean canceled ,
so i &apos;m free for lunch .
um , actually , we have a guest .
hello , orson .
oh , hello .
so , what is it with you and redheads ?
i hope you don &apos;t mind me springing this picnic on you .
i figured it &apos;d be more fun than some restaurant .
are you kidding ? what could be more romantic ?
back off , you son of a bitch !
more wine ?
yes , keep it coming .
hello ?
hey , hey ! who &apos;s the dork ?
carlos ?
what &apos;s with that cap ?
extra , extra , read all about it !
where the hell are you ?
what are you doing at mike &apos;s house ?
i live here .
you live there ? since when ?
my car &apos;s been in the driveway for three weeks .
even you can &apos;t be that self @-@ absorbed .
well , as you can see ,
i have more pleasant things to focus on .
when are you gonna tell jimmy olsen
you hate picnics ?
i &apos;m gonna hang up now .
so where were we ?
your ex @-@ husband moved in across the street ?
what &apos;s that gonna be like ?
yeah ?
are you gonna kiss him ?
that &apos;s right , carlos .
we have had some problems
with raccoons getting into the trash .
so why don &apos;t you just put a lid on it ?
ok , they &apos;re here . now listen , stand up ,
kayla has been through a lot .
so when she walks in the door
i want you to make her feel welcome .
give her a hug and be really nice .
i &apos;m giving her my room . how much nicer do i have to be ?
well , nicer than that ,
or she &apos;s gonna get all your toys too .
hey , hey , look who i found wandering around the airport .
hi , kayla ! we missed you !
we &apos;re so glad you &apos;re here .
ok , boys .
good . yeah . ok , so give her some room .
hey , wow , look , are those presents for kayla ?
yes , they are .
hey , look at that .
preston gave you a harmonica . isn &apos;t that cool ?
harriet the spy . sounds mysterious .
thanks .
and what did you get her , porter ?
a video game .
but i get to play it whenever i want .
porter !
you know what ? i got you something too .
this is nellie .
my grandma gave her to me when i was little ,
and i was hoping you could take care of her for me .
thanks .
hey , why don &apos;t you take your stuff and go upstairs
and get ready for lunch . i &apos;ll make some chili .
ok , daddy .
ok , baby .
honey , that was so sweet to give her your doll .
she didn &apos;t seem that knocked out by it .
well , just give her some time . she &apos;ll come around .
it &apos;s a tough adjustment .
ok .
i must say , bree ,
i don &apos;t know when i &apos;ve tasted such moist pound cake .
sour cream .
so whatever happened to my parrot ?
i set it free .
orson , they don &apos;t fare well in the wild .
you should have sold her .
for god &apos;s sake , alma , who cares about the damn bird .
you set me up !
why don &apos;t i wrap up a piece of this pound cake
for you to enjoy later ?
do you have any idea what you put me through ?
you almost ruined my life .
you &apos;ve rebounded nicely . bree &apos;s lovely .
don &apos;t change the subject .
you put me through a lot , too , orson .
but i forgave you .
can &apos;t we just put this behind us ?
and that &apos;s all you &apos;ve come back for ?
closure ?
of course . what else ?
i &apos;m out of lipstick . can i borrow yours ?
sure .
cherry berry ?
austin likes the way it tastes .
oh , i so did not need to know that .
so , where &apos;re you going ?
down to the jailhouse to talk to mike .
but didn &apos;t you tell ian you wouldn &apos;t see him anymore ?
yeah , but somebody &apos;s got to tell him about his new lawyer .
the guy &apos;ll show up and he &apos;s gonna go , &quot; who the hell is he ? &quot;
ian gets that .
besides , why would it be a big deal ?
mike and i are over .
i was just wondering , because , you know ,
you &apos;re putting on lipstick to go to a prison .
thank you for clearing things up .
oh , well , it was the least i could do .
orson , i &apos;m truly sorry for the pain i &apos;ve caused .
and if there &apos;s anything else i can do ...
actually , there is .
i &apos;d love it if you could join us for dinner this weekend .
there are some friends that i &apos;m just ...
... dying for you to meet .
you got me a lawyer ?
yeah . and he is fantastic .
you cannot believe the scum he has gotten off .
not that you &apos;re scum .
but if you were , you &apos;d be sitting pretty .
i &apos;m paying you back every penny .
well , you know , we &apos;ll figure that out later .
i can &apos;t believe
i just listened to all that stuff edie told me about you .
turns out you &apos;re the only one standing by me .
you &apos;re a good friend , susan .
yeah , about that ...
it &apos;s ian .
he &apos;s not crazy about me spending time with my ex .
even an ex who doesn &apos;t remember dating you ?
i remember , and i guess that &apos;s enough for him .
i &apos;m sorry .
well , i can &apos;t say that i blame him .
you take care of yourself , mike .
you too , susan .
dinner &apos;s ready .
kayla , i made your favorite tacos .
here you go .
where &apos;s my daddy ?
oh , sorry , sweetheart , he &apos;s working late ,
trying to get the restaurant ready .
oh , lovely , parker . go wash your hands . go on .
kayla , where you going ?
to watch tv .
oh , sweetie , we don &apos;t watch tv during dinner .
but my show is on .
well , i &apos;m sorry , those are the rules .
my mommy let me .
just this once .
ok , ok , i know what you &apos;re thinking ,
but kayla &apos;s going through a hard time right now .
come and sit down .
letting her watch tv is like
me letting you eat ice cream when you &apos;re sick .
but she &apos;s not sick .
well , that &apos;s true , but she &apos;s sad .
i &apos;m sad i can &apos;t watch tv .
eat your tacos .
whoa , whoa ! sit your butts down .
it &apos;s not fair !
i don &apos;t care . we have rules .
well , she gets to .
she is special .
now , sit down . come on .
does she get dessert too ?
of course i do .
what an amazing documentary .
you know , i read the director shot over 400 hours of film .
really ? i only counted half that .
i get it . you pick the next one .
ok .
look at you ! who knew you were such a romantic ?
actually , i ... i didn &apos;t send them .
you didn &apos;t ?
so who &apos;s making me look bad ?
uh ... there &apos;s no signature .
i &apos;m sorry . this is kind of awkward .
no , hey ,
i don &apos;t care who worships you from afar ...
... as long as i get to do it up close .
that &apos;s sweet that you &apos;re not jealous .
carlos would have hit the roof if some guy sent me ...
would you excuse me a minute ?
nice try , carlos .
don &apos;t act innocent . you know you sent me these flowers .
why would i get you flowers ?
to sabotage my new relationship .
with picnic boy ? what do i care if you go out with him ?
you care . first you move across the street ,
and then , earlier today , i catch you spying on me
i was not spying . i was mocking you .
you need to move on , carlos .
i have moved on .
you &apos;re the one talking to your ex in the middle of a date .
is he that boring ?
bill is not boring .
he is vibrant .
and sexy .
and yet , here you are .
she threw your doll in the trash ?
no , first she ripped off its arms , stuffed it with chili ,
then she threw it in the trash .
so , what did you do ?
nothing .
and this is after you let her watch tv during dinner ?
well , i didn &apos;t know what else to do .
i &apos;m trying to win over
a little girl who clearly doesn &apos;t want a new mother .
well , i guess giving her special treatment
isn &apos;t gonna solve anything .
you know what might solve something ?
if you were home once in a while .
you &apos;re the one she listens to .
i am trying to open up a restaurant .
our life savings is riding on this thing .
i know , i know .
you know what ?
i don &apos;t want you to be afraid to take a firm hand with kayla .
she &apos;s part of our family now .
and you know what that means .
yeah . i should treat her as badly as i treat my own children .
exactly .
sorry . um ...
i &apos;m not sure i &apos;m ready for that yet .
that &apos;s cool .
can &apos;t blame me for trying , you know .
austin , you know i want to . it &apos;s just ...
hey , don &apos;t sweat it .
if you &apos;re not ready , you &apos;re not ready .
so he didn &apos;t pressure you at all ? what a great guy .
i know . i &apos;m so lucky .
underneath all that bad @-@ boy posturing , he &apos;s a real gentleman .
wow . you &apos;re not only a virgin , you think like one .
beat it , eavesdropper !
no , wait . um ...
what did you mean by that ?
well , uh , guys need sex . all right ? it &apos;s basic science .
so , if he &apos;s not getting it from you ,
he &apos;ll end up getting it somewhere else .
you &apos;re a moron . not all guys pressure girls for sex .
yeah , gay guys don &apos;t . but austin &apos;s not gay .
not even after three beers .
don &apos;t ask .
so , what &apos;s your point ?
if a guy has to wait too long to see you naked ,
he &apos;ll end up seeing you as a friend .
again , science .
don &apos;t listen to him . you hold on to your virginity .
if austin won &apos;t wait , he doesn &apos;t deserve you .
i just don &apos;t want to lose him .
it &apos;s better than losing your self @-@ respect .
take it from a girl who &apos;s
known at school as &quot; little miss van de tramp . &quot;
i thought you made that up .
only because it was nicer
than the other names they were calling me .
i really appreciate you donating this stuff .
anything for a good cause .
everyone at the shelter &apos;s gonna be so excited .
to you and me , these are just a bunch of old clothes ,
but to a homeless woman ...
... it &apos;s a chance for her to feel pretty again .
you ok ?
what ?
i asked if you &apos;re ok .
you seem kind of distracted .
i am fine . yes .
i just remembered , today &apos;s my mother &apos;s birthday .
can we stop by the florist on the way to the shelter ?
yeah .
detective ridley ? my name is susan mayer .
and i &apos;m calling to drop a dime on someone .
that &apos;s the expression , right ?
yes , ma &apos;am . you &apos;ve got the lingo down pat .
good . uh ... his name is orson hodge ,
and he had an affair with the woman
that you think mike delfino killed .
monique polier ? are you sure ?
because mr. hodge saw her body in the morgue .
he acted like he didn &apos;t know her .
well , he does .
so he &apos;s pretending he didn &apos;t .
that &apos;s suspicious , right ?
oh , can you hold on ?
hello ?
susan , hi , it &apos;s bree .
bree ! uh ... hi .
can you hold on a second ?
it &apos;s orson &apos;s wife !
she can &apos;t know i called you .
how about you don &apos;t tell her ?
right . sorry .
i &apos;m new to this whole snitch thing . hold on , ok ?
bree , hi . sorry about that .
damn telemarketer .
so , what can i do for you ?
i just feel really awful about our fight ,
and i think it &apos;s time for an apology .
oh , bree .
i am so relieved .
would you join orson and me for dinner tomorrow night ?
sure .
good , i &apos;ll see you at 8 : 00 .
bree , i just want you to know that , no matter what ,
your friendship means the world to me .
oh , susan , you know i feel exactly the same ...
it &apos;s me again .
you should also know that orson spent a year in an asylum .
hi . can i help you ?
hi , i received some flowers from your shop yesterday
and the card didn &apos;t say who they were from .
can you check ? the name is solis .
sure , sure . just give me a sec here .
solis ?
yeah .
solis , solis ... this is odd .
the buyer asked to remain anonymous .
really ?
well , the flowers were so beautiful ,
i &apos;d like to know who to thank .
sorry . i have to honor their request .
why ? they &apos;re just flowers .
they &apos;re not government secrets .
if you don &apos;t mind , i &apos;m busy .
ok , wait , wait . let me explain .
what &apos;s to explain ? a pretty girl gets flowers .
do you know how many girls never get flowers ?
i work in a flower shop .
i &apos;ve never gotten any freakin &apos; flowers .
so stop your whining about who sent them
and just be glad he did .
you &apos;re right .
and i am so sorry for taking up so much of your time .
and i &apos;m sorry for doing this !
what the hell are you doing ? hey ! hey ! hey !
i &apos;m gonna make it up to you , ok ?
once i &apos;m done , i &apos;ll send you flowers .
hey ! you won &apos;t get away with this !
i know where you live !
yeah , well , stop by . we &apos;ll hot tub .
hey , mister ! help !
she locked me in here !
gabby ?
this is totally her fault .
i mean , i simply asked her if carlos sent me the flowers ,
and she refused to show me the order slip .
are you still hung up on that ?
for god &apos;s sake .
wait , wait !
i need a couple more minutes . i need to know the truth !
what truth is that ?
that you &apos;re still obsessed with your ex @-@ husband ?
what ? no , he &apos;s obsessed with me .
you just imprisoned a florist
to find out if he sent you roses .
ok , i see what you mean .
there . i &apos;m done . let &apos;s go .
actually ... i think i &apos;m done too .
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s ok .
i &apos;m probably not ready to date .
thanks .
and just so you know , i am ready to date .
all right , let &apos;s hit it .
come on , kayla .
i haven &apos;t finished my ice cream .
sorry , but we gotta go . i have a dinner party i have to get to .
they got to finish their ice cream .
well , they , you know ,
wolfed it down like kids are supposed to .
so hurry it up .
kayla , i &apos;m not fooling around . we &apos;re going .
ok .
boys , go to the car . i &apos;ll be out in a minute . go .
listen , sweetheart , i don &apos;t blame you for being angry .
your mom &apos;s gone , and you &apos;re stuck with me .
but ...
... the last thing she said to me was ,
&quot; promise you &apos;ll take care of kayla . &quot;
and i am going to .
but you &apos;re gonna have to help me , ok ?
we can leave when i &apos;m done .
ok . let &apos;s go .
hey , whoa , okay , what the hell are you doing ?
stop ! stop screaming , stop !
leave me alone !
you &apos;re not my mommy !
guys , how would you like
to eat dinner in front of the television for a whole week ?
what are you guys doing here ?
kayla , stop screaming ,
you &apos;re hurting my ears !
just get in the car !
come on , we &apos;re going home !
get your seat belt on !
kids , they &apos;re always roughhousing .
why did you stop ?
well , it &apos;s getting late . i got your blouse unbuttoned .
that &apos;s usually when we call it a night .
do you want to call it a night ?
what , do you want to grab a pizza or something ?
i want to do what you want to do .
well , you know what i want to do .
well , ok .
are you sure ?
yeah . i &apos;m sure .
you can always spot the new guys
by the way they pick through their food .
what did you do when you thought no one was looking ?
the cops say i killed a woman .
but you didn &apos;t , right ?
actually , i have no idea .
i got pretty banged up in an accident .
the last two years are a blank .
well , that &apos;s a fresh approach .
not sure the jury &apos;s gonna swallow it .
it &apos;s the truth .
i believe you .
ok , mrs. mccluskey &apos;s downstairs
and we will be right across the street if you need us .
ok , daddy .
you know , i heard what happened with lynette today .
hey , she &apos;s doing her best .
why are you being so hard on her ?
because it &apos;s her fault my mommy died .
no . no , no , honey , it &apos;s not .
mom only went to that store
because lynette was trying to steal me .
ok , that is not true .
look , honey , it is way more complicated than that .
i know you miss your mommy .
and she loved you very much .
but guess what ?
lynette loves you too .
that &apos;s why you got to give her a chance .
can you do that for me ?
ok . i &apos;ll be good .
that &apos;s my girl .
but i &apos;m never gonna love her .
and you can &apos;t make me .
well , you &apos;ve won .
what did i win ?
bill and i split up .
can &apos;t say i &apos;m surprised .
he wasn &apos;t right for you .
i know .
so just admit you sent the flowers .
i didn &apos;t .
carlos , just tell me . i won &apos;t be mad . i promise .
gabby , if i was gonna send you flowers ,
i wouldn &apos;t send you pink roses .
i &apos;d send you white orchids .
because i know they &apos;re your favorite .
and if i wanted to cheer you up , sunflowers .
and for the flu ... blue irises .
i hate that you know me so well .
and it took so long for that to happen .
now i have to start over again with somebody else .
yeah . that &apos;s what dating is for .
i know , and it sucks .
i mean , you saw me .
i went on a picnic and ate pudding out of a can !
it was horrible !
well , if it makes you feel any better ,
i got dragged to the ballet the other night .
so you are dating ?
that &apos;s why you &apos;ve been lifting weights and jogging .
well , if you wanna bag the big game ,
you gotta work on the guns .
i &apos;ll give you this :
you &apos;re gonna be a tough act to follow , carlos .
back at you , babe .
i &apos;m so sorry to keep you waiting ,
but i don &apos;t want to introduce you until all my guests are here .
i don &apos;t mind .
by the way , um ,
when my friends ask you what happened , and they will ,
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s necessary to go into all that unpleasantness
about orson and monique .
all they need to know is that you &apos;re back
and we &apos;re on good terms .
and orson didn &apos;t kill me .
and orson didn &apos;t kill you .
ok , just one minute , that &apos;ll be susan .
i brought you a bundt cake .
don &apos;t worry , i didn &apos;t make it .
you didn &apos;t have to do that .
i was really touched by your call . it was so big of you .
well , when you &apos;re wrong , you &apos;re wrong .
now that we &apos;re all assembled ,
i &apos;d like to introduce the guest of honor .
i hope you &apos;ll all be as delighted to meet her as i was .
you can come in now .
everyone , this is alma hodge .
orson &apos;s first wife .
oh , about that apology , any time you &apos;re ready .
so you &apos;ve been in canada this entire time ?
well , my aunt agnes has a place in winnipeg .
i hadn &apos;t planned on staying so long ,
but i needed the time to find myself .
would &apos;ve been nice if someone else found you .
there was a lot of drama around here .
yes , i heard .
people actually thought orson had done away with me ?
amazing , isn &apos;t it , where some people &apos;s minds will go ?
well , you gotta hand it to her .
just when you think
bree &apos;s thrown every conceivable theme party .
she hosts a &quot; shame on you
for thinking my husband killed someone &quot; dinner .
so alma &apos;s alive , big deal
we still don &apos;t know what went down
between orson and monique .
susan , please .
we look stupid enough for suspecting him . just let it go .
it may be a little late for that .
detective ridley , can i help you ?
yes , i &apos;d like to speak to your husband .
oh , well , i &apos;m afraid he &apos;s not here ,
but i will be happy to tell him that you came by .
who is it , darling ?
excuse us .
can &apos;t this wait ? we &apos;re having a dinner party .
hello , dr. hodge .
detective ridley .
we need you to come with us .
we have questions
about that jane doe we showed you in the morgue .
why do you think i &apos;d know anything about her ?
well , you were having an affair with her when she died .
and where did you hear that ?
susan .
i didn &apos;t know they were gonna come tonight .
i &apos;m happy to answer any questions that you might have .
my apologies . please , stay and enjoy the dessert .
i don &apos;t believe this . you called the police ?
obviously you weren &apos;t going to .
they needed to know
that dead woman was orson &apos;s mistress .

it is to her , and i don &apos;t want to see her get hurt .
me either .
so , let &apos;s just not tell her .
there &apos;s no place in fairview that &apos;s more peaceful .
all the floors are hardwood .
there are brand @-@ new appliances .
and the gardens are ... well , they &apos;re beautiful .
so , what do you think ?
i &apos;ll take it .
really ? that &apos;s terrific .
i &apos;ll draw up the papers in the morning .
if you don &apos;t mind me asking ,
why were you so interested in this particular street ?
i &apos;ve been moving around a lot in the last few months .
and i need a place where i can really settle down .
you know what i mean ?
i want to live in a place where children know how to behave .
where people still have some sense of moral value ,
and where friendships are good
and strong and last forever .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m looking for .
then i think wisteria lane is the place for you .
good .
more than anything , i just want to fit in .
&lt; i &gt; oh , you will , alma . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; you absolutely will . &lt; / i &gt;
