at mike &apos;s funeral , susan and m.j. said good @-@ bye .
gaby gave her blessing .
you should quit your job .
if being a counselor is gonna make you happy ,
then that &apos;s what you should do .
lynette spoke her mind about tom &apos;s girlfriend ...
i actually don &apos;t think it &apos;s gonna last that much longer .
and the police gathered more evidence .
someone is accusing you of killing killing mr.sanchez.
that &apos;s just silly .
renee perry had waited many months for a proposal ,
and for many months , she had been disappointed .
there had been cozy evening by the fire ...
that didn &apos;t go the way she had hoped .
a romantic moment in wisteria park ...
that wasn &apos;t so romantic after all .
and a beautiful picnic by a lake ...
that turned out to be
nothing more than a picnic .
so when disappointment struck again ...
renee decided to speak up .
dessert ?
that &apos;s the big finale to a 6 @-@ course meal ?
dessert ?
were you expecting , like , a cheese course ?
no !
i was expecting a ring .
you have red roses , champagne .
you are sending me every signal in the world
that i &apos;m about to get a big proposal
and instead , i get a cookie .
well , it &apos;s a chocolate souffle .
whatever . i am not a young woman .
i don &apos;t know how many more fake outs my heart can take .
okay , fine . i @-@ i was gonna propose tonight .
i just did such a horrible job the first time ,
i @-@ i ... i wanted this to be exceptional .
they call it &quot; popping the question , &quot;
not &quot; dragging it out to eternity , &quot;
so come on ! pop !
can i at least , uh , read you the speech that i wrote ?
oh , lord . just give me the last paragraph .
okay .
&quot; for all these reasons and more ,
it is with great honor , that i ask you if you &quot; --
uh , we &apos;re ignoring that . keep going .
... &quot; i @-@ if you would consider making me
the happiest man in the &quot; --
go away !
it &apos;s the police .
we &apos;re looking for a mr. ben faulkner .
i &apos;m ben faulkner . how can i help you ?
you own the condominium project
under construction at chapman woods ?
i used to . bank owns it now .
you mind coming down to the station with us ?
i want to ask you about a body we found on the site .
is ... he under arrest ?
no , ma &apos;am . we just want to ask you boyfriend a few questions .
wait !
he &apos;s not my boyfriend . he &apos;s my fiance .
yes , renee perry had waited a long time for a proposal ...
okay . now you can take him .
and she wasn &apos;t about to let it slip through her fingers .
bree van de kamp started every morning
by catching up on the latest news ,
but sometimes the news came from an unexpected source .
hey , bree . look what happened to my hand .
oh , my goodness !
are you--
we &apos;re getting married .
oh , how wonderful !
yeah , we &apos;re pretty happy .
&quot; pretty happy &quot; ?
oh , we &apos;re ecstatic . knickers to the wind .
over the moon .
congratulations . when did this happen ?
last night . oh , and get this--
in the middle of his big , romantic proposal ,
the cops come by to ask about some dead body
they found at the construction site .
so tell me more .
well , i definitely want a big wedding .
bridesmaids , the works .
i was talking about the body . what did the police say ?
uh , not much . you know , i told them
that i didn &apos;t know anything about it , and they believed me .
good .
although i have to say ,
i &apos;m surprised you didn &apos;t tell me sooner .
you know ...
oh , we &apos;re sorry . uh , it was late ,
and i wanted to tell my sister first .
again , talking about the body .
why would we tell you that ?
and why are we talking about this and not me ?
quite right . i @-@ i just would hate to see this tragic news
interfere with your happy day .
and i don &apos;t think it will ,
but i really don &apos;t think you should worry about it .
uh , the police don &apos;t seem like they &apos;re gonna pose a problem .
that was judge kemp .
he just signed off on that warrant .
for bree van de kamp ?
that was fast .
i might &apos;ve called in some favors .
the sooner i can prove she &apos;s guilty ,
the sooner i can watch her pay for it .
we got another one . um , mitzi kinsky .
&quot; mike was a ray of sunshine on our street .
he will be missed dearly . &quot;
isn &apos;t that lovely ? everybody &apos;s been so generous .
yeah . ten jars of homemade jam .
i don &apos;t know if she was being generous
or just cleaning out her basement .
well , either way , it &apos;s a gesture of love and support .
makes me feel better .
there is my baby boy .
morning , bub .
eggs on a raft ,
just the way you like &apos; em .
these smell gross .
okay , um , not a problem .
is there something else you &apos;d like me to--
m.j.
it &apos;s okay , honey .
um , what do you want ?
strawberry ice cream .
uh , buddy , i don &apos;t think that &apos;s the healthiest way you start your day .
i don &apos;t care what you think .
maybe just this once .
i &apos;ll get you a bowl .
or , uh , no bowl is good .
i &apos;m gonna eat this in front of the tv .
can you bring me some sprinkles ?
of course , honey .
uh , mom .
what ? it &apos;s just ice cream , okay ?
he lost his dad .
okay .
mom , where &apos;s my sprinkles ?
coming !
what &apos;s ... going on here ?
i thought i &apos;d kick off your big resignation day
with a power breakfast .
plus the expiration on this sausage was yesterday .
i gotta say ,
now that the day is finally here ,
i &apos;m starting to get a little freaked out .
don &apos;t you worry .
i &apos;ve made a decision .
i &apos;m getting a job .
what ? you don &apos;t have to do that .
no , i want to . it &apos;s time i help out .
i owe it to you .
so i wrote up a resume ,
i booked a meeting at an employment agency ,
and i even bought myself a girlie briefcase .
but i thought we were just gonna cut back ,
live a smaller life ?
yeah , i thought about that .
then i decided i want a slightly bigger life ,
so i figure if i work ,
the girls can stay in private school ,
we can keep both cars ,
and maybe even take
one of those ski trips we talked about canceling .
gaby , i love that you &apos;re trying to help ,
but an entry @-@ level salary is not gonna cover the cost of skis ,
let alone five nights at the ritz .
well , maybe not now , but if i work my way up the ladder ,
in a few years , i &apos;ll be pulling in the big bucks ,
just like you do .
or did .
what kind of ladder are we talking about here ?
what is it that you &apos;re gonna do ?
i don &apos;t know yet . that &apos;s where the employment lady comes in .
she &apos;s gonna help me figure out
how to best utilize my &quot; skill set . &quot;
yeah , i read that in one of your business magazines .
i &apos;m proud of you stepping up like this .
i hope you find a job that has health care ,
&apos;cause my benefits end today .
what ?
no risky meat without benefits .
yeah , doug and i eloped ,
so this time , i want an over @-@ the @-@ top wedding--
horse @-@ drawn carriages , fireworks ,
poodles dyed purple .
uh , is this weird ,
me going on about how happy i am
while you &apos;re all sad and single ?
actually , i &apos;m hoping i won &apos;t be single for long .
i &apos;ve decided to try to get tom back .
so we &apos;re done talking about me ?
yeah . kinda .
great .
so what are you thinking ?
i figure i &apos;ll just come clean ,
tell him i screwed up , and beg him to come back .
it &apos;s amazing you landed a man in the first place .
well , what do you think i should do ?
oh . throw yourself at him .
next time he stops by , let a boob fall out of your blouse
or maybe bend over in those tight @-@ ass jeans .
that &apos;s not gonna work .
you &apos;re right . sorry .
what do i know about getting a man ?
oh , wait .
a lot .
come on . help .
it &apos;s not gonna be easy splitting them up .
they just moved in together and they seem so happy .
of course they &apos;re happy . they &apos;re in that honeymoon phase .
they &apos;re still taking trips ,
laughing at each other &apos;s jokes ,
pretending they &apos;re interested in museums .
we had a honeymoon phase , too .
maybe i need to remind him of that .
well , remind him naked .
the only tricky part is gonna be getting him alone .
jane watches him like a hawk ,
a tall , bitchy hawk .
well , whatever you do , do it soon .
i &apos;m not gonna waste a plus one at my wedding
unless i know it &apos;s serious .
hey . mom ?
andrew !
it &apos;s wonderful to see you . how are you ?
i &apos;m good . i &apos;m good . i &apos;m really good .
really ? because your sister told me you lost your job .
i &apos;ve been so worried .
didn &apos;t you get any of the messages i left ?
i &apos;ve just been really busy . uh , but everything &apos;s fine .
in fact , i met someone .
you did ? that &apos;s wonderful .
i know how hard your breakup from alex was .
i &apos;m so happy that you &apos;re moving on .
yeah , well , you know , it &apos;s only been a few months ,
but , uh , it &apos;s pretty serious .
how serious ?
serious enough that we were driving through town ,
and i thought the two of you should meet .
he &apos;s here ?
uh , yeah , well , i ...
i want you to keep an open mind .
who &apos;s this ?
this is mary beth ,
my fiancee .
i &apos;m so glad to finally meet you .
i &apos;ve been telling this guy
i can &apos;t marry him until i meet his mom .
so you &apos;re really engaged
to ... each other ?
uh , yeah .
yeah , and remember , you &apos;re happy i &apos;ve moved on , right ?
i just have so many questions .
i know what you must be thinking . it &apos;s too soon .
no , that &apos;s not what i &apos;m thinking .
mom .
i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s just that you &apos;re very different
than all of the other ... dates andrew &apos;s brought home .
well , you know , people change .
so how did you two meet anyway ?
oh , it &apos;s a real cute story .
i was at the community center
for my overeaters anonymous meeting ,
but i went into the a.a. meeting by mistake .
and by &quot; mistake , &quot;
i mean i remembered how drunks love their doughnuts .
so as i was reaching for a buttermilk glazed ,
there was andrew .
you were in overeaters anonymous ?
yeah , i actually lost 220 pounds
and then gained 160 pounds of grade &quot; a &quot; beefcake !
isn &apos;t she adorable ? uh @-@ huh .
andrew , would you help me in the kitchen ?
i &apos;d like to get some tea biscuits ,
and they &apos;re on a very high shelf .
ooh , tea biscuits .
46 calories .
andrew , i do not understand .
what is going on here ?
look , i @-@ i know it &apos;s not who you were expecting ,
but remember how you always said
that being gay was just a phase ,
that i @-@ i just needed to meet the right girl ?
well , you were right .
just be happy for me .
come on . back to bed .
m.j. , it is 2 : 00 in the morning .
you should be in bed .
you can &apos;t tell me what to do .
what did you just say to me ?
hey . turn that back on !
guys ?
what &apos;s going on in here ?
i am trying to get m.j. back to bed .
i can &apos;t sleep .
yeah , well , blowing up aliens isn &apos;t gonna help .
come on .
no , i wanna play my game .
turn it back on now !
shh . shh . don &apos;t get upset .
you can finish your game .
what ?
just for a little while ,
then you have to go back to bed , okay ?
mom , can i talk to you for a second ?
i think you &apos;re making a mistake .
it &apos;s not that big a deal .
yes , it is .
look , i know what he &apos;s going through is awful ,
but this isn &apos;t helping .
he &apos;s totally taking advantage of you .
he &apos;s not taking advantage .
he &apos;s traumatized ,
and it &apos;s killing me to see what he &apos;s going through ,
so if i can give him a little joy
by letting him play video games ,
that &apos;s what i &apos;m gonna do .
so i &apos;m looking to make in the 6 @-@ figure range ,
plus benefits , of course .
and i have two young girls , so flexible hours would be good .
and we always take this big vacation ,
so i &apos;ll need two weeks off . maybe three .
you know what ? just give me all of august .
so what do you got for me ?
a reality check .
excuse me ?
mrs. solis , you &apos;re gonna have to adjust your expectations .
up ?
no . have you not been reading the newspapers ?
the job market right now is brutal .
i have people with phds that i can &apos;t find jobs for ,
and frankly , your job experience is very limited .
modeling , modeling , modeling .
okay . okay . okay .
print ,
runway ,
boat show .
who &apos;s the job expert here ?
plus , there &apos;s a 15 @-@ year gap here .
yeah , to be a doting wife
and a loving mother of two .
you have experience with children .
i have a job at a day care center .
and deal with other people &apos;s kids ?
i don &apos;t even like my own .
look , you didn &apos;t go to college ,
you didn &apos;t even graduate high school ,
and your only references are
photographers and aging rock stars .
in today &apos;s market , you &apos;re basically unemployable .
and you actually get paid for this ?
so now what am i supposed to do ?
well , you could start planning that august vacation .
gabrielle solis was depressed ,
and when she was depressed ,
nothing lifted her spirits like a good workout ...
of her credit card .
may i help you ?
yeah , uh , i just wanna get that little red scarf i saw in the window .
then i &apos;ll be on my way .
all right .
although that ...
black sheath dress would go perfect with it .
look at those over @-@ the @-@ knee boots !
okay . who am i kidding ?
get me a double cappuccino and muscscar stock boy .
mama needs a new pair of everything .
i said taupe . this is clearly beige .
we don &apos;t have it in taupe .
second floor , third mannequin from the left . look alive .
i &apos;ll try these in plum ,
these in leopard ,
these ... oh , forget it .
no lady wants to see anything under 4 inches .
you go with you . you go with you .
you go away .
no one &apos;s been able to make that romper work .
should we help her ?
stay back . she knows what she &apos;s doing .
navy blazer , silver hoop earrings , platform wedge .
and a red patent leather clutch .
genius ! genius .
everything looks and smells so amazing , mrs. van de kamp .
do you mind if i take a picture ?
of the food ?
that way i eat just a little bit now ,
and then later , when i &apos;m hungry ,
i can look at the picture and get full on the memory .
don &apos;t you just wanna eat her up ?
not before i take a picture of her .
you know , mary beth ,
i just realized i don &apos;t know a thing about you .
what do you do ?
well , actually , nothing .
my parents have been pretty generous .
oh , really ? what , uh , sort of work are they in ?
none of your business , mom .
no , no . it &apos;s okay .
they invented mary beth &apos;s frozen custard .
mary beth ? you &apos;re that mary beth ?
recognize me ? the kid on the carton ?
it &apos;s in every supermarket in the country .
it must be a multibillion dollar--
would you help me in the kitchen , andrew ?
now .
andrew , i knew you were having financial troubles ,
but i never thought you &apos;d stoop to this .
what ?
she &apos;s an heiress .
you &apos;re obviously marrying her for her money .
i &apos;m marrying her because i &apos;m crazy about her .
we love the same movies . she makes me laugh .
she gets me . she &apos;s really an amazing girl .
i think i found your good side !
smile , gnocchi .
she &apos;s disturbed .
okay . all right . she &apos;s a little eccentric ,
but you know what ? i love her .
andrew van de kamp , you love italian shoes .
you love mid @-@ century modern furniture .
and according to your internet history , you love ...
army doctors giving elaborate physicals to young recruits .
but you do not love girls .
why can &apos;t you accept that i &apos;ve changed ?
because homosexuality is not a choice .
you were born this way .
i &apos;m the one who told you that .
and it took me a long time ,
but i was finally able to wrap my head around it .
honey , you &apos;re here , you &apos;re queer ,
and i &apos;m used to it .
you know what , mom ? i &apos;m not here anymore , all right ?
mary beth , let &apos;s go .
hey .
how was your dad &apos;s ?
fine .
she was in a bit of a mood ,
but i still love you unconditionally .
let me guess--did it have something to do
with a certain taylor swift concert this thursday night ?
i &apos;m just saying ,
all my friends &apos; moms are taking them .
and all your friends &apos; moms are gonna be deaf for two weeks ,
like i was the last time i went to a concert .
i &apos;m not doing it .
it &apos;s not fair .
i am gonna go give paige a bath .
thank you for bringing her home .
i &apos;m gonna go grab your suitcase .
mom ! please !
it &apos;d make you the bestest mom in the whole wide world !
nope . the matter is closed .
this sucks .
you know who else likes taylor swift ?
me .
i mean , if your parents are okay with it , i &apos;ll take you .
oh , my god !
you &apos;re the best !
i &apos;ll check with my mom and call you ?
can &apos;t wait .
okay !
so ?
totally worked .
you &apos;ll have dad all to yourself thursday night .
you are the bestest girl in the whole wide world .
gaby !
hi , babe .
what is that ?
this ?
it &apos;s a boot .
i bought a boot .
you bought ... one boot ?
yep . &apos; cause i &apos;m frugal .
one day i &apos;ll buy the other one .
that &apos;s all you bought ?
because i got a call from the bank .
seems somebody was going crazy with your credit card .
huh . maybe it was stolen .
yeah .
by a size 0 with incredibly expensive taste .
what is this shopping bag doing under the bed ?
i bought a gift for a woman
whose husband is in iraq , fighting for our freedom .
gaby ! you &apos;re taking it all back .
i can &apos;t .
not if i &apos;ve worn it .
can &apos;t take it back . can &apos;t take it back now .
see ? it &apos;s all--
stop . stop . stop . stop . stop !
our lives have changed . we can &apos;t afford this anymore .
not unless you got some big job you haven &apos;t told me about .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i met with that job lady .
but she basically said i &apos;m not qualified to do anything .
i didn &apos;t finish school . i &apos;ve never had a real job .
the only thing i &apos;ve ever gotten paid for is being pretty .
i just feel like my life
has been one bad decision after another .
uh ... what about the girls ?
what about marrying me ?
that &apos;s the part that hurts the most .
you guys are the only good thing i &apos;ve ever done ,
and i feel like i &apos;m letting you down .
gaby ...
you are smart .
you &apos;ll figure something out ,
something great .
but in the meantime ,
all these clothes
have to go back .
i know .
could you just give us a moment alone ?
hello ?
yes , this is his mother .
he did what ?
he threw a stapler at you ?
yes , right at my head .
are you sure it wasn &apos;t an accident ?
he couldn &apos;t have been aiming at your head .
what he said was--
and i wrote this down because i wanted to be exact--
&quot; leave me alone ,
or i &apos;m going to throw this stapler at your head . &quot;
i @-@ i &apos;m so sorry .
you do know that m.j. just lost his father , right ?
i do . my heart goes out to both of you .
but there is no place for violence in my classroom ,
no matter what the circumstances are at home .
&quot; circumstances &quot; ?
i mean , it &apos;s not like he just lost his favorite toy
or a pet turtle .
he ... lost his dad .
yes , but if m.j. had thrown that stapler a little harder ,
my grandkids might have lost their grandmother .
well , i &apos;m sure that he is sorry .
he isn &apos;t . in fact , he said--and i quote--
&quot; bull &apos;s @-@ eye . &quot;
i &apos;m considering having him removed from my class .
okay . uh ...
what m.j. did was wrong ,
but ... i &apos;m finding it hard to believe
that a person that spends so much time with children
could be so oblivious to a child &apos;s pain .
i have 20 other children i need to protect .
and m.j. is a very angry little boy .
well , of course he &apos;s angry .
he &apos;s 9,
and one of the most important and loving people
in his life has just been ripped away from him .
and now he has to live with the fact
that his father is never coming back .
inside voices , please .
oh , to hell with your &quot; inside voices . &quot;
his father is dead .
my husband is dead !
oh ! my foot .
it &apos;s her .
why is everyone looking at me ? did i do something wrong ?
no . no , in fact , we have done nothing
but talk about your shopping skills for the last 24 hours .
really ?
yes . we even went back
and watched the security tape to see it again .
well , keep the tape . it was my last show .
what ?
uh , circumstances have changed .
my shopping days are over . so just do me a favor .
wait till i &apos;m gone to restock the boots .
i can &apos;t cry again today .
uh , wait . wait .
take care of these for mrs.solis
and bring her a glass of champagne .
champagne ?
did you not hear me ? i &apos;m broke .
you have no reason to suck up to me anymore .
well , i do if i want you to work here .
huh ?
you see , you &apos;re like a ... a shopping savant ,
and every day , women come in here with all the money in the world
and no clue what to spend it on .
you could help them .
you mean like a personal shopper job ?
no , do not think of it as a job .
for you , my dear , it is a calling .
i don &apos;t know .
employees get a 40 % discount .
hi . welcome to cumberly &apos;s .
my name &apos;s gabrielle . can i help you ?
i want to thank you for accepting my apology .
and coming over before you left town .
i feel like i haven &apos;t had the appropriate reaction
to this wedding .
no . no , no , you &apos;ve been wonderful .
to show you how excited i am that my little boy is getting married ,
i &apos;ve thrown you a surprise engagement party .
mom , what the hell is this ?
oh , i just invited some of your old friends over
to congratulate you .
hey , girl . i haven &apos;t seen you in ages .
those shoes are ferosh .
who &apos;s this hag ?
this is andrew &apos;s fiancee mary beth .
hi , mary beth .
i &apos;m brian with an &quot; i. &quot;
this is bryan with a &quot; y. &quot;
what is this about you getting married ? we need to dish .
um , uh , sweetie , why don &apos;t--
why don &apos;t you go in the kitchen and grab a drink ?
i just love those boys .
they used to be here all the time .
so what did you think of andrew &apos;s friends ?
they seem sweet and very well @-@ groomed .
well , yeah , but don &apos;t they seem ,
i don &apos;t know , a little ... disco @-@ y ?
mrs.van de kamp , i know andrew &apos;s gay .
you do ?
we &apos;ve never actually made love ,
and he has a picture of michael phelps next to his bed .
says it &apos;s patriotic , but ...
i don &apos;t understand . if you know about him--
you have to understand ,
i grew up fat and lonely .
when i lost all the weight ,
i thought men would look at me differently , but they didn &apos;t .
i just kind of gave up .
oh , mary beth .
but then i met andrew . he &apos;s sweet , fun ,
and i just thought ...
i could do a lot worse .
no . no . no . now you listen to me .
you deserve real romance and passion in your life .
i know all about this .
i have been with plenty of men for companionship
when it should &apos;ve been for love .
the right man for you is out there somewhere .
you just can &apos;t settle .
it &apos;s not fair to you or to andrew .
i think we need to talk .
all right .
coming ! coming ! coming !
okay .
oh , no .
hey . i @-@ i came as soon as i got your message .
so power &apos;s out , huh ?
i know . this is so embarrassing .
i just got off the phone with the electric company ,
and it turns out it &apos;s a faulty line ,
so they &apos;re gonna fix it first thing tomorrow morning .
so you don &apos;t need me to look at anything or--
i &apos;m sorry . i feel terrible dragging you
all the way over here ,
so you want something for your trouble ? a drink or--
nah . no . no . i don &apos;t-- i don &apos;t want to be in your hair .
no , no . you &apos;re not .
honestly , it &apos;s a little scary
being all alone in a dark house .
hence the hundreds of candles .
yeah , i did go a little overboard , huh ?
what are you cooking ?
it smells amazing in here .
yeah ? i &apos;m trying out a new recipe for the kids .
beef bourguignonne .
but penny &apos;s with jane
and parker &apos;s having pizza with the martindales .
i love beef bourguignonne .
oh , that &apos;s right . i totally forgot .
y @-@ you remember the first time we tried it ?
new york . our second anniversary .
oh , that must be where i got the idea .
i was just looking at pictures from that trip .
oh , yeah ? you--you got out the old photo album ?
yeah .
oh , ho ho . man !
look at us .
why don &apos;t you stay for dinner ? i &apos;ll make you a plate .
yeah , i don &apos;t know .
come on . jane &apos;s at the concert .
what would you rather do--
eat a microwave dinner all alone in your apartment or ...
beef bourguignonne ?
well ...
i hate for it to go to waste .
well , i hope you &apos;re happy .
mary beth is on her way back to wisconsin .
i &apos;m sorry .
why are you so concerned about her life ?
what about me ? ! i &apos;m your son .
i did this for you . can you look me in the eye
and tell me you would &apos;ve been happy
spending the rest of your life with that woman ?
that marriage really could have helped me out ,
and you have no idea how much help i need .
why ? what is going on ?
where do i start ? um ...
well , i took a loss on the house that you got me ,
i , uh , i lost my job ,
can &apos;t find a new one .
i have a ton of credit card debt ,
and mary beth was willing to help me out with all of that .
well , so would i. why didn &apos;t you come to me for help ?
do you know what it feels like to have to keep running back
to your mother to fix your problems ?
my whole life , you &apos;ve been propping me up--
when i needed a job , when i was dumped , when i was drinking .
i &apos;m just--i &apos;m so tired
of you seeing me as a failure .
andrew , if you would go through all of this
rather than come to me for help ,
then i am the one who &apos;s failed .
how about we just agree that we both failed ?
so what are you gonna do now ?
i don &apos;t know . i had a pretty good setup there--
a place to live , somebody who needed me ,
all the frozen custard i could eat .
well , i don &apos;t have any custard ,
but i can offer you a place to stay ,
and ... someone else who needs you .
all right .
but just until i get back on my feet again .
now let &apos;s talk about that party .
i could swear i saw bryan with a &quot; y &quot; checking you out .
ah , well , actually ,
i am more into geoffrey with a &quot; g. &quot;
now that &apos;s my gay son .
god , look at all the stuff we &apos;re doing .
we used to be interesting .
i know . we--we hiked . we went to the theater .
we--we took salsa lessons .
and then came the kids .
ah , fun killers . huh .
mmm . this is amazing .
it &apos;s even better than that restaurant in new york .
i don &apos;t know . that place was pretty good .
how did we even find it ?
you don &apos;t remember ?
we got caught in that torrential downpour .
we ducked in there to dry off .
right . and then the owner insisted on making us a special meal
because we had that newlywed look .
a lot of water under that bridge , huh ?
yeah , but it was a pretty strong bridge .
look how young we were .
yeah .
back then i could actually see without my reading glasses .
here you go . best i can do for light .
thank you .
i &apos;m glad you kept these .
good memories , huh ?
yeah .
you know , sometimes you just get ...
overwhelmed by work and ...
kids and life , and it &apos;s just ...
so easy to ...
forget .
yeah .
yeah , it is .
i &apos;m on fire .
oh , my god . oh , my god ! i &apos;m on fire !
oh ! oh , my god ! oh !
are you okay ?
i think i burnt the skin .
oh , jeez . let me see .
oh , it doesn &apos;t look so bad .
i thought the power was out .
they must have ... fixed it .
you set this up .
you know , in--in my defense , i--
what the hell is going on ?
i just wanted to see where we stood ,
if there was still anything between us ,
if we could find our way back to those people in the pictures .
by tricking me ?
i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry about how i did it ,
but you can &apos;t deny what just happened .
you still feel something .
jane just moved in with me ,
and you do this now ?
hi , mom .
hey . how was the concert ?
awesome .
how &apos;d it go with dad ?
not so awesome .
yeah , i kinda got that from the sweatpants .
mm . come here , you .
so now what ?
i ... don &apos;t know .
well , i &apos;ll tell you what you can &apos;t do .
give up .
taylor swift has this song ...
&quot; you belong with me . &quot; it &apos;s ...
about how she won &apos;t stop loving this guy
even though he &apos;s with the wrong girl .
and when she sang it tonight ,
all i could think about was you and dad .
and this guy she loves--
does he eventually come to his senses ?
it wouldn &apos;t be a very good video if he didn &apos;t .
and don &apos;t worry .
dad will , too .
you think ?
mom , you &apos;re fighting for him .
what guy doesn &apos;t like that ?
you know ...
when you say something really smart like that ,
it makes me think i did a really good job .
you think it &apos;s gonna blister ?
it &apos;s a first @-@ degree burn .
tom , you &apos;ll be fine .
but as your physician ,
let me recommend-- no more candlelit baths alone .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what i was thinking .
well , the good news is i can declare you healthy enough
for any and all sexual activity .
actually ...
i need to get some work done .
okay .
well , the nice thing about us living together--
if you change your mind , you know where to find me .
okay .
that &apos;s the last of them .
okay .
actually , we &apos;re not done here .
i want to talk to you .
is this about what happened at school ?
yes .
you need to know that it is never okay
to throw a stapler at someone .
i know .
it &apos;s also never okay to sweep a bunch of stuff
off someone &apos;s desk because you don &apos;t like
what they &apos;re saying about your son .
particularly if they &apos;ve just had bunion surgery .
you did that to mrs. butters ?
i &apos;m not proud of it , but yeah .
i was really mad .
just like you .
m.j. , something horrible happened to you ,
and every time you started to get angry about it ,
i wanted to cover it up with ice cream or video games ,
but the truth is , we shouldn &apos;t cover it up .
we should let it out .
now we can &apos;t hurt people ...
but we can ...
hurt jam .
mom !
people sent us this to help us feel better ,
and it &apos;s going to ,
just not in the way they thought .
come on , buddy .
you got a lot to be angry about .
what happened ... sucks .
oh , sweetie .
i love you .
i love you .
i love you so much .
that &apos;s a cake i made for a wedding a few years ago .
i know what you &apos;re gonna say .
it &apos;s too extravagant .
it &apos;s not big enough .
oh . well , i suppose we could add another tier .
make it two .
i really appreciate this , bree .
ben is such a guy .
he &apos;s not gonna be any help planning this wedding .
yes , especially since he &apos;s dealing
with the nasty business of the body .
oh , that ? no , ben &apos;s in the clear .
really ?
yeah , the cops called this morning .
uh , they figured out the guy they found
died eight months ago .
that was way before ben started construction .
yeah , the cops think the guy was just some poor drifter .
anyway , it &apos;s over .
oh , good .
well , now we can focus all our energy
on giving you the best wedding in the world .
tomorrow we &apos;ll start our planning .
yes , in life ,
when we see an opportunity , we have to take it ,
whether it &apos;s the hope of winning back the love of our life ...
a shot at proving our worth ...
or the chance to show a child the right path .
but sometimes when we answer the call ...
hello ?
hi . it &apos;s bree .
we have no idea what opportunity awaits us .
renee just told me the good news ,
and i wanted to thank you for keeping my secret .
ah , no worries . i told you i would .
i know . but even when suspicion moved on to you ,
you still protected me , and that &apos;s very honorable .
really , it was no big deal .
maybe not to you .
you &apos;re not the one who put a body in the ground .
you have to understand , a day doesn &apos;t go by
when that does not weigh heavily on my conscience .
