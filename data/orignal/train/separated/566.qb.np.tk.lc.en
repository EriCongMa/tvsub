why is everyone wearing those hats ?
is the dean planning another ridiculous event ,
or is the greendale hat club still
struggling to be noteworthy ?
you &apos;re talking about it .
i talk about lots of stuff that annoys me .
speaking of the dean ...
guten tag , homies .
i hope you &apos;ll all be attending oktoberfest .
it &apos;s not often we get to celebrate german culture .
it &apos;s not often we want to .
yeah ... a little goes a long way .
true .
greendale &apos;s oktoberfest has never drawn huge crowds ,
probably due to our diversity .
so this year , we are adding some color !
kick it !
i &apos;m gonna give this to you , troy .
&quot; pop and locktoberfest . &quot;
the central event will be a pop @-@ and @-@ lock @-@ a @-@ thon .
winner gets to annex poland .
kidding !
the winner gets an itune gift card .
okay .
oh ! a break @-@ dance contest .
what should we name our team ?
okay . i &apos;m gonna go hang myself in my closet .
i &apos;m comin &apos; with .
is it me , or is this campus
getting more cartoonish every day ?
yep . it &apos;s exciting .
i painted a tunnel on the side of the library .
when it dries , i &apos;m going for it .
okay . you see that guy over there ?
the one wearing the gucci suit
and the lightweight woven wool @-@ mohair blend ?
we used to work together .
cool . so he &apos;s from your origins .
this is all i need .
excuse me , sir . you &apos;re all my friend needs .
your mouth isn &apos;t curved upwards . did i misread something ?
ah ... tango ?
sundance .
we worked with different partners .
got it .
what brings you to greendale ?
i &apos;m a teacher .
wait . that &apos;s worse than the truth .
i &apos;m a student .
hey , i &apos;m in no position to judge .
i &apos;m here for an n.a. meeting , so ...
narcotics anonymous ?
remember when you asked
for my secret , i said yoga ? i lied .
i &apos;m abed .
hey .
abed , this is alan connor .
this guy and i
used to wipe the courtroom floor with prosecutors .
d.a. called us the litterbugs ,
we put so much trash back out on those streets .
come here , come here !
you still ticklish ?
stop that !
hey , hey , hey . let &apos;s get a drink , huh ?
are you allowed ?
yeah . i quit doing blow ,
not being rad .
all right , let &apos;s do it .
wait . jeff can &apos;t go . he has class .
well , those cargo pants would suggest otherwise .
what has this place done to you ?
ah . you have no idea .
hat club !
now you have some idea .
第二季 第二集
so ...
so ?
anyone that &apos;s ever been in a team pop @-@ and @-@ lock @-@ a @-@ thon
knows you need at least seven people to stand a chance .
we have seven .
oh , do you ?
word has it on campus that winger &apos;s too busy
hanging out with his cool new lawyer friend .
slow news day .
that &apos;s your carson ?
john stewart .
you depress me .
look , we &apos;ll get back to you .
all right , well , don &apos;t take too long .
and don &apos;t rip off this exit .
where is jeff ?
obviously hanging with alan .
those two are like siamese twins
attached at the cell phone holster .
i haven &apos;t met him yet .
shouldn &apos;t we be happy that jeff found an old friend ?
our concern is that alan is to jeff
what rob lowe was to james spader
in the 1990 film bad influence .
he &apos;s a bad influence .
you saw it ?
hey , uh , guys .
uh , i &apos;m gonna be a little bit late today .
alan and i are gonna take a quick sidebar .
mmm , or any bar .
oh , he &apos;s got britta down !
you look familiar .
that &apos;s possible .
have you or someone you know been injured at work ?
yes ! a shrimp boat ran over my cousin .
that &apos;s serious . call me .
and , jeff , you need to be more respectful of our time .
shirley , if killed a man ,
as a christian , would you forgive me ?
i would .
then either that man &apos;s life is
worth less than your time ,
or it &apos;s okay for me to be late .
ha ha ! no !
you still got the moves , man .
if they gave away awards for mind games ,
the statue &apos;d be jeff winger doing it to a brain .
come on , jeff &apos;s bush league .
i gave seminars on manipulation .
i could reach into a man &apos;s soul
and unravel it with one tug .
cool . hit me .
you &apos;re bald .
so are you .
i &apos;ll kill you , you--
come here !
mistrial .
ha ha ha ! come on .
i have hair .
father , i have hair .
on a tax evasion case .
yeah .
god , i miss talking about this stuff !
well , you should visit the office .
right . i can &apos;t show my face there
after getting busted like that .
jeff , you know what lawyers call someone
who defrauds the state bar ,
cheats on his lsats ,
and cons his way into a firm ?
best ... lawyer ... ever .
seriously ?
hey , tomorrow night . office party .
you &apos;re my guest .
oh . naw .
come on , you just said you missed it .
i do .
i really , really do .
what does alan have that we don &apos;t ?
a butt for jeff &apos;s weiner .
i mean , we all have butts too .
we have butts . just not for the same thi--
i &apos;m trying to say they &apos;re gay .
well , i don &apos;t like how much drinking and carousing they do .
it &apos;s a gateway to narcotics .
narcotics ! i know how i know alan !
but i &apos;m not allowed to say .
which means that you met him in narcotics anonymous .
why bring it up if you &apos;re not allowed ?
because ... he said something at a meeting
about something bad he did .
and he might have done it to jeff ,
but i can &apos;t say what it is .
okay . you &apos;ve gone from precious to annoying .
what if you don &apos;t say it out loud but we guess ?
like charades ?
with this group ?
i &apos;m watching .
four words .
&quot; alan got jeff disbarred . &quot;
oh , please , those junkies weren &apos;t thinking about rules
when they were shooting up scag .
jeff , alan narced on you !
narced ?
hmm . but he &apos;s like way too primo for that ,
frank zappa .
i think he turned you in to the state bar .
i was in an n.a. meeting , and he bragged about it .
he doesn &apos;t recognize me , because my hair &apos;s longer ,
my skin &apos;s clearer , i--
i &apos;ve lost a lot of weight .
annie .
he said he turned me in ?
he said he sent an email
that got a rival coworker fired .
it was around the time you got caught .
i know they never covered this on yo , gabba gabba ,
but that &apos;s called circumstantial .
any other meaningless conspiracy theories ?
yes . did you know that go @-@ gurt is just yogurt ?
you know what a therapist
calls this kind of a relationship , right ?
a gold mine .
codependent .
you guys don &apos;t want me to be happy .
you want me to need you .
it &apos;s getting a little claustrophobic .
i used to run full @-@ speed through the boundless wilderness ,
and now i &apos;m in the zoo
where the horizon is wallpaper and the air is stale
and nothing is ever at stake .
in other words , we &apos;re not cool .
i never said that . you may have heard it .
i may have thought it , and it may be true .
but i never said it .
jeff , will we see you
tomorrow night at the pop @-@ and @-@ lock @-@ a @-@ thon ?
no , abed , i &apos;m going to a cool party
at my cool former law firm
from when my life was cool .
fine . you can be on the team .
new deal .
if we win , i get to be in the study group .
the stakes have never been higher .
i just wanna thank everybody for coming .
you know , when i became a lawyer ,
i had a dream .
i had a dream that one day i &apos;d be head of a firm
so nobody would be able to talk about
the big , weird hole in my hand .
i know everybody talks about it behind my back ,
and that &apos;s okay . you know , i would .
what &apos;s great , though , is that you don &apos;t stare
or ask any questions .
and as a reward for your restraint ,
got a little something for ya .
there .
that oughta keep you goin &apos; to christmas .
everybody have fun tonight !
anyone else with that hand would wear a glove .
he controls a room with it .
he &apos;s the master .
well , he sure is a fan of yours .
oh , um ...
hey , when you talk to him ,
will you mention me ?
he keeps passing me over for partner .
alan , did you invite me here with an ulterior motive ?
god , i miss this place !
god , it &apos;s a sea of wingers .
this whole place reeks of moral ambiguity .
actually , that was me . i apologize .
now , you guys are new to high society ,
so just ... follow my lead ,
everything will be fine .
first , why are you here ?
second , i don &apos;t care . leave .
as a matter of fact , jeff , we were invited .
why would anyone do that ?
hey , you guys made it !
come on in .
okay , before this gets more embarrassing ,
what is your misguided plan ?
to apologize to you for casting aspersions
on your friend .
and to show you we can be cool .
hey ! is that jeff winger ?
find annie and leave .
ted ! hey , man !
what &apos;s goin &apos; on ?
once annie gets alan &apos;s office number ,
you guys break into his office , hack into his emails ,
and find proof that he screwed jeff over .
fourth floor . 470 .
first he said it was 69 .
i wanna rub purell on my brain .
you are so missed here , jeff .
if we had five guys around here with your balls ,
we wouldn &apos;t need 30 lawyers .
true . but we &apos;d need a good doctor .
ted , stop hittin &apos; on my date .
i &apos;m kidding . we can share .
i get the head !
i love the brain in there !
i &apos;ll eat it .
hey , everybody , jeff winger &apos;s here !
hey !
shouldn &apos;t we notify someone
that our team &apos;s not gonna make it to the pop @-@ and @-@ lock @-@ a @-@ thon ?
you actually think anybody cares ?
um , checking in for the heather pop and locklears .
okay . and , um ... where &apos;s the rest of your team ?
oh , they &apos;ll be here .
i suppose you &apos;re allowed to start by yourself ,
but you won &apos;t stand a chance if you don &apos;t have someone--
they &apos;ll be here !
i brought stuff people use for capers .
suction cup .
credit card .
chloroform .
the credit card doesn &apos;t work , the chloroform does .
annie , go back and keep lookout .
why me lookout ? why not you guys ?
&apos;cause if someone comes up here ,
kanye and kumar get taken to jail .
you get taken to dinner .
you guys !
i am the smartest one in this whole group ,
and all i &apos;ve been used for is bait and distraction .
go on your stupid mission .
i hope it sucks .
what did she say ?
i don &apos;t know .
all i heard was suck .
i &apos;m surprised that alan hasn &apos;t made partner yet .
i &apos;m surprised i haven &apos;t fired him .
why ? i mean , he &apos;s got a better win record than i do .
he &apos;s a spineless trust fund jagoff .
i &apos;ll tell you what , jeff .
you &apos;re the best liar i ever employed .
if you can look me in the eye
and tell me you actually like alan ,
i &apos;ll make him a full partner .
well , i only ever really liked one person .
my mom .
and she liked my dad .
and after all the dust and custody was settled ,
the guy i really admired-- not liked , admired--
was the lawyer leaving the courthouse
in the great @-@ looking suit
and a sky blue mercedes slk .
sweet ride .
sweet job .
sweet life . he didn &apos;t care .
he couldn &apos;t care .
and the less he cared , the better he was .
we are a special breed
because we rise above the sloppy stuff
and look at the bottom line .
you wanna like your employees ?
open a hair salon .
you wanna win ?
make alan partner .
the student has become the master .
thank you , jeff .
you make me wanna be a worse man .
by the way , just &apos; cause you can &apos;t work cases here
doesn &apos;t mean you can &apos;t work .
you can always be a consultant .
ted ... that would be amazing .
oh . i &apos;ll be right back .
i didn &apos;t know they had rules .
hey , jeff . i &apos;m sure you know philip .
did you know
that if i sleep with philip once a month ,
i can use his beach house in rio whenever i want ?
wow .
you guys are really on to something .
i think you found the world &apos;s newest profession .
guys , guys , did you know
i actually have a civil case
against that bitch that stole my husband ?
shirley , don &apos;t sue a stripper .
why not ?
she &apos;s a stripper .
life sued her , and she lost .
where &apos;s pierce ?
jeez , why am i even worried about him ?
did you know there &apos;s an island in indonesia
where you can hunt people ?
we need to talk .
i think this is it . print it .
&apos;scuse me .
who are you guys ? this is not your office .
i can explain .
let me explain .
oh , my god !
i didn &apos;t know what to do .
oh , my god !
i usually have one foot out of reality ,
and even i &apos;m freaking out right now .
you chloroformed the janitor ?
stop yelling at me ! you &apos;re the ones that got caught !
you &apos;re the one who &apos;s yelling !
we &apos;re in big trouble ! we have to do something !
oh , i don &apos;t know what to do .
my whole brain is crying !
guys , guys , guys !
hey , hey , i have an idea .
okay , it may sound a little weird , but trust me .
what &apos;s ... happening ?
oh ! we all got chloroformed !
somebody chloroformed all of us .
and now we &apos;re regaining consciousness together .
i don &apos;t understand . who &apos;s she ?
why is she holding a rag ?
okay , that was the worst idea ever .
can we please just run away now ?
yeah .
yeah .
sorry .
it is the fourth straight hour ,
and ben chang is still on his own .
one can only imagine what is driving him to ...
push himself to such limits !
my body hurts .
my body hurts .
you jealous because we &apos;re fitting in with your cool friends ?
no . i &apos;m distracted , watching you mutate .
britta , you &apos;re not a whore .
shirley , jesus turned the other cheek .
he didn &apos;t garnish wages .
pierce , do i even need to say this ?
it is bad to hunt man for sport .
bad ass .
this is the email that alan sent the bar association .
he stabbed you in the back , jeff .
he &apos;s a bad friend .
you &apos;re right .
he is a bad friend .
but he is a good lawyer .
now , i appreciate
you guys caring ,
but you have to understand that i don &apos;t .
caring is lethal around here .
it &apos;s--it &apos;s a disease .
you guys have it . i don &apos;t .
so if you do care about me ,
don &apos;t infect me .
now ,
go win that pop @-@ and @-@ lock @-@ a @-@ thon .
i &apos;ll see you monday .
it &apos;s like watching a soul slip through our fingers .
but what more can we do ?
would you stop ?
tango !
i don &apos;t know how you did it , man ...
but you &apos;re looking at the firm &apos;s next partner .
if i wasn &apos;t actively repressing my bi @-@ curiosity ,
i would kiss you full on your beautiful mouth .
well , maybe you can return the favor one day .
maybe ... i can return it right now .
you probably know
that it was someone here at the firm who turned you in .
god , this is really hard .
alan ... it &apos;s okay .
you can tell me .
it was thompson .
thompson .
yeah .
thompson that adopted three at @-@ risk teens
and donated his kidney to a temp .
all an act .
yeah . why do you think he quit right after you left ?
well , his-- his wife died .
did she ... jeff ?
did ... she ?
anyway ... congrats .
hey , let &apos;s go do some shots with phil , huh ?
no , you go ahead . i , uh ...
i think i caught something ...
at--at greendale .
college chicks . i get ya !
you &apos;re bad !
it hurts !
shamone ... it hurts !
ben , you need to switch up your moves .
ohh , did my eyes could see troy barnes checking in for the save .
oh , my god !
only two teams left .
the poppy lockstockings ,
and the heather pop and locklears !
troy , what &apos;s wrong ?
i don &apos;t know .
my heart &apos;s just not in it .
maybe we should quit .
i mean , who even cares about this anyway ?
next step , looks like jeff winger .
oh , jeffrey , you &apos;re back !
did you miss me ?
took you long enough .
now we got it .
hey ! yes !
jeffrey , did you punch alan in his rotten face
and then storm out ?
hell , no .
that guy &apos;s useful to me .
thanks to you , i &apos;ve now got leverage
over a spineless jag that just made partner .
that is the place i want to work .
but i prefer to hang out with cool people ,
people so cool ... they care .
and now ... the puppet .
jeffrey !
ah , no parking on the dance floor , winger .
no , i &apos;m serious . you &apos;re disqualified .
the winners are the poppy lockstockings !
noooooo !
i been popping and locking
for five hours ,
and you threw it all away !
the contest doesn &apos;t matter .
what &apos;s important is we have each other .
then ... can i be in your study group ?
well , that wasn &apos;t the deal .
we lost , so ...
that was dope , what we did .
that was so good !
the puppet too ! the puppet was so ...
i rolled my ankle during that .
aw !
twisted it ?
it was worth it , though .
you know what , he &apos;s bringing us down .
let &apos;s move him . can we move him ?
psst ! troy !
it &apos;s me .
abed ?
i made it through !
i &apos;m a cartoon now .
that &apos;s impossible .
nothing &apos;s impossible in here . animals can talk .
your heart is shaped like a heart .
and the smell of pie can make you float .
you have to believe , troy .
wait ! you don &apos;t have to believe .
i didn &apos;t .
i didn &apos;t .
