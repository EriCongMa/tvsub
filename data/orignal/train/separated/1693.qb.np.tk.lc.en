buona sera , luigi &apos;s pizza .
buona sera .
it means good evening in italian .
may i say , having to explain that to you calls into question
the authenticity of your ristorante ?
okay , i &apos;m out of here .
un momento .
oh , for heaven &apos;s sake .
now you &apos;re being deliberately stupid .
where are you going ?
i &apos;m having dinner with priya at raj &apos;s .
i think howard &apos;s going to be there . you want to join us ?
but tonight &apos;s thursday .
on thursdays , everybody comes over here
and has pizza .
or a reasonable facsimile
prepared by someone claiming to be luigi ,
but who sounds suspiciously like jackie chan .
can &apos;t we make a one @-@ time exception for tonight ?
we could .
we could also stop using the letter &quot; m , &quot;
but i think that idea is isguided and oronic .
just come with me to raj &apos;s .
well , i don &apos;t want to go to a party .
it &apos;s not a party . it &apos;s the same group of people
who hang out here hanging out over there .
i &apos;m sorry , but five people eating and chatting is a party .
how come it &apos;s not a party when we do it here ?
because we don &apos;t throw parties .
i don &apos;t know what to tell you , sheldon .
i &apos;m going to see priya . everyone &apos;s over there .
you coming or not ?
well , no , sir , and do you know why ?
in a word :
tradition .
every thursday night for the last eight years ,
you and i and our friends have gathered here
in this very spot to break bread covered with cheese and sauce ,
discuss the issues of the day ,
and yes , share a laugh or two .
but i guess our rich heritage means nothing to you .
i guess you &apos;re right .
see you later .
wait !
leonard ! wait !
what am i going to do for dinner ?
come with me to raj &apos;s and eat there .
i can &apos;t do that .
what if he serves haggis and blood pudding ?
i really doubt that &apos;s what he &apos;ll serve .
but what if he does ?
i &apos;ll be obliged to dine
on liver and lungs stuffed in a sheep &apos;s stomach .
and frankly , blood pudding is essentially the same thing .
i don &apos;t know why he &apos;s serving both .
what do you want to do ?
you want to come with me , or do you want to sit here alone ?
no , i &apos;ll go to your haggis party .
but i &apos;m telling you .
this is adness . this is utter and complete adness .
oh , dear !
what ?
raj &apos;s television .
i just realized
we &apos;re about to spend an evening watching a plasma screen
with a cluster of dead pixels in the upper left @-@ hand corner .
so don &apos;t watch tv .
read a book .
and be a social pariah ?
oh , you know that &apos;s not my style .
the audible sigh is a show of exasperation , right ?
right .
is it about me or the dead pixels ?
hey , you &apos;re just in time .
we made tex @-@ mex .
oh , sounds great .
oh , indians making tex @-@ mex .
might as well have had the chinese pizza .
hey , you .
hi .
that &apos;s got to be fun for you , huh ?
watching hofstadter suck the saliva
out of your sister &apos;s mouth ?
excuse me . before this evening goes any further ,
we need to decide where everyone is going to sit .
there is no assigned seats , sheldon .
just sit anywhere . make yourself comfortable .
oh , what fun .
we &apos;re like hippies at a love @-@ in .
just sit here .
right on , man . right on .
oh , look .
it &apos;s harry potter and 98 % of the sorcerer &apos;s stone .
okay , we &apos;ve got fajitas
with all the fixins , so you make your own .
wonderful .
dinner , some assembly required .
do you want a margarita , sheldon ?
a margarita ? !
where are we ? ! what is happening ? !
oh . hey , sheldon .
what can i get you ?
water . neat .
with a little umbrella .
where are all your friends ?
sadly , penny , this evening , i am the dark knight ,
roaming these mean streets alone .
a windbreaker for my cape ,
and a stern expression for my cowl .
okay .
excuse me ?
isn &apos;t this the point where the world @-@ weary barkeep
absentmindedly wipes down the bar
and coaxes the woes out of the troubled patron ?
well , i was getting your stupid umbrella , but all right .
what &apos;s troubling you , buddy ?
i don &apos;t think your heart &apos;s in it , but since you asked ...
apparently , because leonard is dating raj &apos;s sister ,
we &apos;re all forced to hang out at his apartment .
oh , the horror .
indeed .
yeah , at one point , raj put on reggae music ,
and his sister took off her shoes .
it was like the last days of caligula .
oh , i have to get this .
umbrella ?
wonder what she &apos;s exasperated about .
hello ?
sheldon , are you all right ?
when last we spoke , you were going to
take a taxi home from raj &apos;s , but according to facebook ,
you just checked in at the cheesecake factory .
yes , i was in a taxi ,
but the driver didn &apos;t look at all
like the photograph on his license ,
so i leapt out and ran for it .
wise .
there you go .
just like recovering alcoholics drink in the caribbean .
hi , bestie .
oh . hi , amy .
how you been ?
fine .
from this angle , i can see up your nose .
yeah , it &apos;s a great time to be alive , isn &apos;t it ?
don &apos;t worry . my problems can wait
while you two hens finish your clucking .
look , sheldon , leonard is dating priya .
she is staying with raj .
that means you &apos;re all probably gonna be hanging out there more .
penny , i &apos;m sorry you got dragged into this .
i know you &apos;re devastated
that your ex @-@ boyfriend has found an exciting new lover
with flawless , caramel @-@ colored skin .
okay , i &apos;m not upset about leonard and priya .
your flaring nostrils indicate otherwise .
cluck @-@ cluck @-@ cluck .
sheldon , look at me .
i think it &apos;s time
to face the fact
that leonard is the nucleus of your social group .
where he goes , the group goes .
leonard the nucleus ?
that makes no sense .
i &apos;m the whimsical elf
that everyone looks to for a good time .
i &apos;m not saying that you &apos;re not fun .
you &apos;re the most fun person i know .
a lot of people think i &apos;m fun to be around .
don &apos;t be needy , bestie .
that &apos;s probably part of what chased leonard away .
what i am saying , sheldon ,
is that your group is leonard @-@ centric .
if it were a town , it would be leonardville .
if it were an islamic nation , leonardstan .
if it were the birthplace of motion pictures ,
we &apos;d all be singing &quot; hooray for leonardwood . &quot;
ooh , i got one .
if you guys were a band ,
you &apos;d be called leonard and the leonards .
so needy .
what you doing ?
i &apos;m setting out snacks .
you do realize everyone &apos;s eating at raj &apos;s again tonight .
i didn &apos;t say the snacks were for you now , did i , nosy rosie ?
you &apos;re having people over ?
yes . must be killing you wondering who .
fine , i &apos;ll tell you .
stuart from the comic bookstore ,
barry kripke from the university ,
penny &apos;s ex @-@ boyfriend zack
and tv &apos;s levar burton .
really ?
levar burton &apos;s coming here ?
possibly . i tweeted him .
okay , well , tell him i loved him on star trek .
please , leonard , stop trying to horn in on my new friends .
of course . good night .
leonard .
yeah ?
we had a good run , you and i.
okay .
but change is a part of life .
it certainly is .
okay .
i have guests coming .
i &apos;m afraid i &apos;m going to have to ask you to leave now .
i am leaving .
don &apos;t make this harder than it is , leonard .
good @-@ bye , sheldon .
and good @-@ bye to you , sir .
he &apos;ll be back .
of course i &apos;ll be back . i live here !
well , it would appear
levar burton won &apos;t be joining us .
let &apos;s get started .
i thought we &apos;d begin by going around the room ,
introducing ourselves
and saying a little bit about why we &apos;re here .
okay . i &apos;m sheldon .
uh , for regular readers
of the new england journal of high energy physics ,
i need no introduction .
if you &apos;re not familiar with that publication ,
there &apos;s a free copy in your goody bag .
stuart ?
um ... hi . i &apos;m stuart .
i run a comic bookstore ,
which for financial reasons , i &apos;m currently living in .
i guess what i &apos;m hoping for most out of tonight is a hot shower .
it &apos;s very nice , stuart .
zack ?
i &apos;m zack , and i &apos;m , uh ...
uh ...
could you come back to me ?
of course .
barry ?
i &apos;m barry kwipke , and i &apos;m here
because you told me there was going to be a whaffle .
when is the whaffle ?
patience , patience , barry .
the whaffle ...
the raffle is the grand finale
to an evening @-@ long festival of fun and folly .
one more question ...
yes , you must be present to win .
okay , i &apos;m ready .
i &apos;m zach , and i &apos;m , uh ...
oh , crap , why is this so hard ?
oh , hey .
hi .
yo , p @-@ dog .
what &apos;s up ?
we &apos;re here to kidnap you for a girls &apos; night out .
parenthetical : the term &quot; kidnap &quot; is being used playfully .
i kind of figured that .
good . now put this pillowcase over your head .
no .
she used to be much more fun ,
until leonard punched her in the heart .
we just thought you might want to go out
and have a good time , maybe go dancing .
oh . gee , thanks , but i &apos;m not really in the mood .
you do understand that it will distract you
from obsessing over the rich variety of sweet loving
that your ex @-@ boyfriend
is currently receiving from the fiery jewel of mumbai .
okay , look ,
if i agree to go out with you guys ,
will you promise to stop pestering me about leonard and priya ?
yes .
sure .
all right . i &apos;ll go change . come on in .
if you &apos;d have let me bring the chloroform ,
we wouldn &apos;t have had to put up with all this jibber @-@ jabber .
anyway , after we get done snowboarding ,
i go back to the lodge and get in the jacuzzi .
there &apos;s no one around , so naturally , i &apos;m free @-@ balling it .
next thing i know ,
this beautiful chick shows up ,
drunk out of her skull , wants to get in with me .
question .
was it a jacuzzi or a hot tub ?
really ? that &apos;s your question ?
what &apos;s the difference ?
&quot; jacuzzi &quot; is a commercial brand .
&quot; hot tub &quot; is the generic term .
i.e. , all jacuzzis are hot tubs ,
but not all hot tubs are jacuzzis .
is that like all thumbs are fingers ,
but not all fingers are thumbs ?
surprisingly , yes .
nice .
now , what exactly are toes ?
can you please get back to the drunk girl ?
i &apos;d like something to think about in the shower .
oh , yeah .
right . anyway , she takes off all of her clothes ,
climbs into the hot tub , and the first thing i notice ...
the water level rose .
no .
of course it did .
it &apos;s said that archimedes ,
the ancient greek mathematician ,
discovered the principle of displacement while taking a bath .
terrific . go ahead , zack .
naked drunk girl , free @-@ balling , continue .
forgive me , but i think you &apos;ll find
my story is more interesting .
does yours have wet breasts in it ?
better .
it has a gold crown .
you see , the king wondered how much gold was in it
and charged archimedes with coming up with the solution .
because the crown was irregularly shaped ,
there was no way to mathematically determine its volume .
but , while bathing , archimedes realized
he could immerse the crown
and measure the amount the water rose .
so , long story short , i nailed her .
when he finished , he shouted &quot; eureka ! &quot;
no , i always shout , &quot; holy moly ! &quot;
don &apos;t know why . just do .
all right ,
that concludes the &quot; getting to know you &quot; portion of the evening .
who &apos;s ready to play some vintage video games ?
and tonight &apos;s selections include
colecovision &apos;s &quot; smurf rescue in gargamel &apos;s castle , &quot;
atari &apos;s &quot; cookie monster munch , &quot;
and for you text adventure aficionados ,
&quot; zork . &quot;
pick me , pick me . i &apos;m fun .
that all sucks the big hairy meatball .
how about i go get the karaoke machine out of my car ,
get plastered and blow the roof off this place ?
great , i &apos;ll make a beer run .
and i &apos;ll take a shower .
we &apos;ll meet back here in 15 .
check .
i &apos;m unhappy .
this is delicious .
where &apos;d you learn to make chili ?
when i was at university in england ,
my flatmate was from texas .
i hope she wasn &apos;t anything like my flatmate from texas .
sheldon is a bit quirky , isn &apos;t he ?
oh , please . that crazy bastard &apos;s looking
at quirky in the rearview mirror .
did you know that , per our roommate agreement ,
i have to wash my feet before i get in the shower ?
and not in the sink .
we each have special buckets .
raj , did you ever tell your sister
about the time sheldon got punched by bill gates ?
oh , god , you &apos;re kidding .
nope .
gates gave a speech at the university .
sheldon went up to him afterwards and said ,
&quot; maybe if you weren &apos;t so distracted
by sick children in africa ,
you could have put a little more thought into windows vista . &quot;
bam . right in the nose .
made me proud to own a pc .
i &apos;d like to propose a toast
to a rare and wonderful sheldon @-@ free evening .
hear , hear .
cheers .
you realize that &apos;s the first time we &apos;ve ever done that
without having to listen to sheldon tell us
why it &apos;s called a toast ?
why is it called a toast ?
oh , the ancient romans
put spiced toast in their punch bowls .
sheldon tells it better .
he kind of does .
yeah .
aw , hell , i miss him .
so , where do you guys want to go dancing ?
we were hoping you &apos;d know a place .
yes , perhaps somewhere packed tightly
with young , beautiful bodies
sweating and writhing against each other
in a glorious orgy of the flesh .
oh , yeah , i know that place .
what do you think ?
that should display enough of your bosom
to attract a new mate , or a hungry infant .
okay , let &apos;s go through this one more time .
just because leonard has a new girlfriend
does not mean i need to go out and hook up with some guy .
but you could if you wanted to , right ?
well , yeah , i guess .
pick out the hottest guy in the room ,
take him home , do unspeakable things to him ,
then kick him to the curb with a smile on his face
and teeth marks on his heinie ?
more or less .
what &apos;s that like ?
i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s fun while you &apos;re doing it .
and then after , it &apos;s mostly embarrassment ,
self @-@ loathing and regret .
i would take that deal all day long .
yeah , well , it &apos;s not gonna happen tonight .
you know , for the first time in my life ,
i am not in a relationship ,
and i &apos;m totally okay with it .
you know , if being on your own is new to you ,
i &apos;d be happy to share some tension @-@ relieving techniques
for ladies i &apos;ve perfected over the years .
for example , do you have an electric toothbrush ?
um , no .
you should get one .
what &apos;s that ?
it appears to be something preserved
between two pieces of acrylic .
oh , it &apos;s a snowflake from the north pole .
leonard gave it to me last year .
oh , god , that is so romantic .
yeah , it was .
leonard &apos;s really one of a kind .
saying that while holding a snowflake
is a bit heavy @-@ handed , don &apos;t you think ?
let me see that .
oh , screw it .
i can deal with a little self @-@ loathing .
let &apos;s go find me a heinie to bite .
outstanding .
and if we fail , we can always stop at cvs
and pick you out a nice toothbrush .
i call mine &quot; gerard . &quot;
that &apos;s kind of creepy .
* don &apos;t go breaking my heart *
* i couldn &apos;t if i tried *
* oh , honey , if i get restless *
* baby , you &apos;re not that kind *
* don &apos;t go breaking my heart *
anybody do &quot; walking on sunshine &quot; yet ?
no .
dibs .
i &apos;m sorry , sheldon bought a loom
and learned how to weave ?
he actually got pretty good .
he made us all matching serapes .
i still wear mine when there &apos;s a nip in the air .
now , was this before
or after he adopted the 25 cats ?
long before the cats .
i think it was around the time he tried
to declare our apartment a sovereign nation .
i still have some of the currency .
all my friends .
all my friends .
all my friends .
i think it &apos;s like beetlejuice .
we said his name too many times .
come on in .
thank you .
hey . i thought you were with your new buddies .
i had to leave .
they were having fun wrong .
come here , sheldon . sit here with me .
thank you .
would you like some homemade chili ?
are there beans in it ?
yes .
then it &apos;s not chili .
real chili has no beans in it ,
but you &apos;re from a foreign land ,
so your ignorance is forgiven .
sheldon , do you want some or not ?
yes , please .
your girlfriend &apos;s a little short @-@ tempered .
i &apos;d like to propose a toast
to friends , no matter how quirky .
cheers .
priya , do you know why this is called a toast ?
actually , i do .
i believe the romans used to put spiced toast
in their punch bowls .
she &apos;s also a bit of a know @-@ it @-@ all .
mmm . this is good .
whatever it is .
* i &apos;m walking on sunshine *
* i &apos;m walking on sunshine *
hello ? i ...
* i &apos;m walking on sunshine *
oh , i don &apos;t think so .
