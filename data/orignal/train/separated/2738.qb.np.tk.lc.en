fuck you doing ? scared the piss out of me .
some things you don &apos;t get into over the phone .
got it . lorraine &apos;s at mass .
watch out for spencer .
who ?
her fucking toy terrier &apos;s a shit machine .
i talked to some of the guys about your misgivings .
yeah ?
listen , i &apos;ve made a decision .
take a walk in there .
what the fuck you waiting for ? get lost .
historically , carmine always said the sopranos
are nothing more than a glorified crew .
plain and simple ,
we decapitate and we do business with whatever &apos;s left .
what ?
nothing .
i agree in spirit but i gotta counsel .
this should have been done during john &apos;s era .
they got redundant upper management ,
bleeds off half the kick .
we take &apos; em out , absorb the whole fucking thing .
take out an entire fucking family ?
let me tell you a couple or three things .
forget coco . forget fat dom
who goes over to jersey and never comes back .
forget my brother billy .
phil , that &apos;s not what i &apos;m saying at all .
anthony soprano has no respect for this thing .
he &apos;s never been in the can , not really .
he &apos;s a guy who stepped over his own uncle to grab the big seat .
his father &apos;s brother .
please , huh ?
i &apos;m embarrassed .
i let him come to the hospital last christmas
and i took his fat fucking hand in friendship .
philly , you had a heart attack .
listen to me . they make anybody and everybody over there .
and the way that they do it is all fucked up .
guys don &apos;t get their finger pricked .
there &apos;s no sword and gun on the table .
phil .
no , alb .
either it has meaning or no meaning .
and the vito thing , the man harbours a faggot .
it &apos;s true .
five fucking families
and we got this other pygmy thing over in jersey .
there &apos;s no scraps in my scrapbook .
make it happen .
i like the way she played basketball yesterday .
almost got my first hard @-@ on in a month .
jesus , what &apos;s the meaning of quiet time around here ?
rhiannon ?
aj ?
jesus .
what are you doing here ?
you first .
i have some food issues , depression .
you keep up with hernan ?
he &apos;s a slimeball .
i caught him finger @-@ banging my cousin on the ski lift .
somebody said you were modelling .
yeah , i guess .
i signed with elite .
so you would say he &apos;s responding to the therapy .
well , we don &apos;t do traditional therapy per se .
kids in crisis mostly need an environment of calm ,
no stresses .
do you want this ? or i can pop it in the mail .
just one more week of this .
$ 2,200 a fucking day .
gabagool &apos; , provolone
and vinegar peppers .
you believe this fucking weather ?
end times , huh ? ready for the rapture .
how &apos;s the anti @-@ terror going ?
great if you don &apos;t like sleeping ,
eating or seeing your kids .
listen , those arabs from the bing ...
let me ask you the truth .
they &apos;re in jordan getting their balls zapped ?
you &apos;re not gonna tell me ?
i &apos;m not really sure . for all we know ,
they may be harmless pistachio salesmen .
don &apos;t get so bent out of shape . you &apos;re a big boy , tony .
you know , world war ll ,
your outfit protected the brooklyn navy yard .
you think roosevelt told vito genovese
where hitler was holed up ?
go fuck yourself .
tony , hold up .
tony
what ?
look , i appreciate what you did , giving us those names .
in fact , i &apos;ve been sitting here thinking ...
remember that thing i told you about
that was supposed to happen about a year ago , your problem with brooklyn ?
it &apos;s on again , possibly .
you , maybe people close to you .
if it was solid you would have been warned by the newark office ,
but my colleague in brooklyn ,
the one with the collaborator ,
snitch is implying the wheels have been set in motion .
implying .
where the fuck you been ?
krista fell off her shoes last night .
we had to call an ambulance .
i had some shit i was taking care of .
you &apos;re gonna want a snort .
come on , i just finished my bialy .
take it .
burt gervasi , he &apos;s gone .
what happened ?
i didn &apos;t want to overload you with aj in hospital .
i don &apos;t wanna hear that . go .
burt let me know the other night
he &apos;s been playing both sides of the fence with new york .
burt ?
measures were taken .
burt wasn &apos;t speaking for just himself .
guys are getting squeezed hard to sway them
towards new management .
they thought you &apos;d be a part of it .
and he got an answer .
my hope is maybe now phil gets the message .
you know , we can talk this shit through .
talk ?
talking about phil .
we gotta hit first .
this dovetails with other information i got
that this cocksucker already has a target on my back .
it &apos;s a big move .
so ...
buddha .
when he stuck you with the tab for vito junior ,
i said let it go .
obviously , truth is , a fuck like phil ,
appeasement don &apos;t work .
three pops within a tight time frame ,
24 hours , so there &apos;s no chance for them to hit back .
top three guys .
paulie gaultieri ?
no , management .
tony soprano , obviously ,
plus silvio dante and we think bobby baccalieri .
that mortadella &apos;s number three ?
he used to be junior soprano &apos;s driver .
and you used to sell laser printers out the back of your crown vic .
you really slept .
yeah .
i wasn &apos;t asleep .
you want some oatmeal ? i &apos;ll make some .
instant or the real thing ? i have half and half .
i can &apos;t find my belt .
it must be up there somewhere .
what ? you hid it ?
i &apos;ll make the real thing .
you &apos;ll let me know when it &apos;s ready ?
sure .
you know , my game has got ...
i have a casualty , he &apos;s urgent ... in response ,
the insurgents unleash a devastating wave of ieds
and suicide bombers .
who got hit ? you got comms with them ?
on a small but deadly road ...
anthony .
regarding our friend with the grey hair ,
i thought about it . i want you to call ltaly ,
get some cousins of ours over .
who you want to run the thing ?
got it .
gotta get some tyres for carmela &apos;s car .
the wine &apos;s amazing .
jennifer &apos;s our resident ltalian wine expert .
is megan still in prague , stace ?
jesus , her love life . the girl she was involved with , cecily ,
she &apos;s now having a torrid pen @-@ and @-@ paper relationship
with an armed robber in attica .
what is this fascination with criminals ?
rescue fantasy . they think they can fix them .
i &apos;m worried for cecily .
so i googled any new stuff on sociopathic personalities .
apparently , the talking cure ...
helps them become better criminals .
it was fascinating .
the study was by yochelson and samenow .
studies turn around every few years .
this other , i think it was robert hare ,
suggested that sociopaths ...
actually quite glibly engage on key issues
like mother , family .
i seem to remember that from residency .
me too , and i &apos;ve read hare ,
but who &apos;s a true sociopath ?
i had a guy at the state asylum ,
slow poisoner . they even mimic empathy .
they blubber and cry .
did you put her up to this ?
she just happened to mention this study ?
who ? me ?
everything ok down there ?
i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s a study . food for thought .
she &apos;s blowing us off .
you just can &apos;t resist rubbing my face in it .
i feel like we should change the subject .
i only suggested you re @-@ evaluate your work with leadbelly
or be prepared to deal with moral
and possibly legal consequences .
leadbelly ? who &apos;s that ? come on .
the answer is a female opera singer
and gangster ...
elliot !
soprano .
tony soprano ? he &apos;s your patient ?
that &apos;s pretty cool .
jesus christ , elliot .
chill out . we &apos;re among friends .
we &apos;re all professionals .
so what &apos;s your verdict on the wine , jen ?
all ltalians have big noses .
if i had made that joke about ...
other groups represented at this table ,
i would be called a bigot .
i meant ltalian reds .
still , it must be fascinating work .
it is .
have a seat .
what &apos;s up ?
phil leotardo .
calls were made to zips . they &apos;re coming over from naples .
you contact the guy to contact the guys .
phil &apos;s at his goomah &apos;s every friday night .
t know about this ?
what ?
what kind of question is that ?
watch your fat mouth .
hey , whoa . what are you concerned about ?
i lived through the &apos; 70s by
the skin of my nuts
when the columbos were going at it .
there ain &apos;t a bigger cocksucker than phil leotardo .
i just wanna make sure somebody knows
there could be a line of cozarellis a mile long .
duly noted . so there &apos;s no problem , then .
it &apos;ll be fine .
paulie , those guys are outside .
fuck you talking so loud for ?
don &apos;t discuss this until we &apos;re in the pisciad ?
it &apos;s all yours .
i just picked &apos; em up at the airport .
anthony .
so what do you clear a year around here ?
i don &apos;t mean to pry , just round numbers .
i &apos;m asking because meadow ,
i told you she &apos;s taking pre @-@ med classes ,
well , she &apos;s not gonna be a doctor .
she told us .
it &apos;s kind of sad , isn &apos;t it ?
depends .
it &apos;s just a nice thing to be ,
helping sick babies .
her change of heart bothers you ?
her mother too , much more than me .
i mean , all that worry ,
which private school , columbia university ,
this and that , and in the end
she &apos;ll get married , squeeze out some kids
after what , a couple years in the work force ?
i &apos;m still working .
yeah , but you &apos;re divorced .
criminal law , that &apos;s what she &apos;s taking up .
and i told carmela it &apos;s not the end of the world .
she &apos;s interested in ...
civil rights , muslims and blacks
and that
and a dime .
hopefully she &apos;ll wind up at a big firm ,
white @-@ collar crime .
just ,
you know , dr soprano .
sounds nice .
your parents must have been very proud .
i think so .
look at all the people like me you &apos;ve helped .
with all the human suffering in this world ,
you &apos;ve done something important ,
like those people
who are trying to help my son .
god bless &apos; em .
$ 2,000 a day in that place ,
but if it helps ...
and as you know , my plumbers &apos; union insurance
only covers 10 % of mental .
he &apos;s really hurting ,
aj .
and you ?
although , maybe ,
you know what ? forget his hurts . maybe i should have ...
put your shoe up his ass ?
yeah , frankly .
well , we talked about this .
i talked about it .
carmela ...
mollycoddled him .
my old man ...
are you a shining example
for the huge collection of wingtips and loafers
that must be lodged up your lower bowel ?
what &apos;s the matter with you ?
is it because i said that about being divorced ?
you were saying .
he &apos;s my only son .
he &apos;s young . most of the time they pull out of this .
i &apos;ve been depressed for years . what if he don &apos;t pull out ?
so the boy who never cared about anything
now cares about too much .
yeah , i guess .
and the daughter , like all females ,
ultimately somehow disappoints .
i didn &apos;t say that .
what &apos;s with the tone ?
you sound like you &apos;re glad
i &apos;m taking it on the chin .
maybe you &apos;re projecting hostile feelings .
bullshit . if we had instant replay ,
you &apos;d see it in two seconds .
well , we don &apos;t have instant replay .
i know that . jesus christ , you sound like my fucking wife .
your &quot; fucking wife .
you know what i mean .
the departures magazine out there ,
did you give any thought at all
to someone else who might wanna read it
before you tore out the entire page ?
what ?
it &apos;s not the first time you &apos;ve defaced my reading materials .
you saw that ?
people tear shit out of your magazines all the time .
they &apos;re a mess . i try to read &apos; em .
i don &apos;t think i can help you .
change &apos; em . bring in some new shit .
i mean therapeutically .
what are you talking about ?
i &apos;ve only missed three appointments since that heart @-@ to @-@ heart .
the new big thing these days is called
&quot; psychodynamic therapy &quot;
combined with anafranil .
who ?
a medication . there &apos;s a doctor in bloomfield
you could see .
ok . now , what the fuck is this ?
you &apos;re firing me
cos i defaced your departures magazine ?
i &apos;m giving you my considered medical opinion .
ok , i should have asked you for the steak recipe .
and missing sessions ,
unfortunately , is part of my condition .
what do you know about your condition ?
you miss appointments because you don &apos;t give a shit
about commitments , about what i do ,
about the body of work
that &apos;s gone into building up this science .
go ahead , tell me again i sound like your wife .
well , if the shoe fits ...
we &apos;re making progress . it &apos;s been seven years .
do you want some names ?
ok , i &apos;m gonna tell you something
and you &apos;re not gonna like it ,
but we can say anything ...
go ahead !
i &apos;m chalking this all up
to female menopausal situations .
you &apos;re not my gynaecologist .
you don &apos;t need a gynaecologist to know which way the wind blows .
so , wait a minute .
you &apos;re telling me
after all this time ,
after everything we shared in here ,
you &apos;re cutting me loose just as my son got out of the hospital
for trying to kill himself ?
since you are in crisis ,
i don &apos;t want to waste your time .
i &apos;m gonna be fucking honest .
as a doctor ,
i think what you &apos;re doing is immoral .
yes ?
dhl .
yes ?
package ,
dhl express for mr philip .
for sign .
for sign .
yeah .
it &apos;s done .
the love interest got in the way .
couldn &apos;t be helped , apparently .
you ever see phil with the goomah ?
once , maybe . why ?
could he talk to her in ukrainian ?
ukrainian ? the fuck do i know ?
i gotta go .
paulie , it &apos;s done .
listen ,
i quit therapy .
and this time i &apos;m never going back .
except for that slight improvement around the shooting ,
she wasn &apos;t doing you much good .
here we go .
hi , strangers , how are you ?
how are you ?
good , not bad .
good .
there they are .
so mead &apos; was in here
with patrick parisi .
yeah .
we are very happy .
very happy .
is it true what she said ?
yes , thank god . we are so relieved .
you know , with alds and ...
it &apos;s not just that .
i don &apos;t know one doctor
who is advising his children to go into medicine .
between the insurance companies over their shoulder ,
the hospitals are making cutbacks ...
she &apos;d have been good at it .
always intellectually curious , even as a tyke .
does compassion come naturally to her ?
patience ? i &apos;m not so sure .
what are you talking about ?
so what is she gonna do now ?
well ...
law .
constitutional law .
what about aj ? how &apos;s he doing ?
he &apos;s good . he &apos;s good .
good .
tone , you know who &apos;s in tonight ?
&quot; mangenius . &quot;
he &apos;s the jets &apos; coach , sweetie .
i should go say hello .
ok .
so mead &apos; and patrick parisi ?
little awkward , though , maybe .
patsy still works for tony . he &apos;s an underling .
cupid &apos;s dart lands , you know ?
i &apos;m gonna send some limoncellos over in celebration .
great .
you don &apos;t answer your fucking phone ?
i tried you 50 times last night .
we shut &apos; em off .
gab came down with terrible food poisoning .
you can pass the word upstairs . the grey goose is gone .
good .
the goomah had to be taken out too .
but i say , who gives a fuck ?
remember that drunken scene she caused at the jersey boys party ?
i actually felt bad for phil .
what &apos;s the matter ?
whenever i think of that fucking play ,
i picture ma dying alone
like a dog on that bus .
you &apos;re gonna make someone happy with this news today .
think i &apos;ll ask for some time off .
who does this look like ? look .
don &apos;t cry . good little girls don &apos;t cry . babies cry .
hey .
how &apos;s it going ?
good .
have my card game .
carm volunteered to take nica .
emptying the pool ?
costs a fortune to heat .
yeah .
what can i do you for ?
had a call from mario diaco .
who &apos;s that ?
uncle jun &apos;s accountant .
the one with the artificial voice box .
says he &apos;s been trying to reach you for two weeks .
uncle jun &apos;s finally out of money .
they think that maybe there &apos;s some squirrelled around ,
but he can &apos;t remember .
it &apos;s a fucking sin , isn &apos;t it ?
plus , with the larynx ,
he thinks mario &apos;s from outer space , so ...
the upshot is he can &apos;t pay
for living at wycoff psychiatric any more
and they &apos;re gonna move him to a state facility .
i know , tony ,
but jesus , those fucking places are snake pits .
then he &apos;ll make some new friends .
i understand .
you gonna bail him out ?
we don &apos;t have that kind of money . we &apos;d contribute .
bobby feels ...
you know .
right .
you got a lot of balls coming to me .
and as for your husband , janice ,
exile on main street .
don &apos;t say that .
you trust a guy , you bring him along
and for what ?
he feels sorry for junior ?
bullshit .
tone , it &apos;s bad news .
paulie said he wants it known it &apos;s on him ,
he takes full responsibility ,
but that he didn &apos;t do nothing .
shit .
yeah , nobody ,
i mean nobody , knows where the fuck phil is ,
four or five days now .
so we never really had a shot at him .
how about the house in florida ?
i had beans send somebody past .
the house is all shuttered up .
he put everything in place , his moves on us .
he goes into hiding , waits it out .
going to ground , they call it .
who ?
it &apos;s an expression .
who knows what the fuck he &apos;s got planned ?
get word to everybody . eyes in the back of your head .
break routines , collections , all that shit .
you tell everybody .
got it .
in the meantime , we keep trying . get a 20 on phil .
beautiful .
you never see a blue comet in that condition .
i mean , look at the coaches .
every window still lights up .
if that train still ran new york to ac ,
atlantic city would be a much different place today .
better class of people .
i suppose .
who the fuck really knows ?
still , it &apos;s nice to think that .
imagine riding in that club car ,
sipping on a negroni .
eight grand the whole set ?
there &apos;s other people interested .
i &apos;m gonna go for it .
your son will like this too .
looks fast .
he don &apos;t care .
hurry up , for christ &apos;s sake .
all right .
if i &apos;m working away from the office i should have this stuff .
wanna make yourself useful ?
get the girls &apos; pay slips over there .
put &apos; em in a bag . or give &apos; em to me .
come on .
all right .
let &apos;s go .
yeah , that &apos;s them there .
fuck !
let &apos;s get the hell out of here .
wait here .
melissa found a memory stick in my prada bag
that wasn &apos;t printed .
god , remember what a dick this guy was at first ?
yeah .
i need to talk to you .
nobody called you ?
no . what &apos;s the matter ?
bobby &apos;s dead . he &apos;s shot . sil &apos;s in the hospital .
what happened ?
could be several things .
leave here ?
till we get the situation under control .
what does that mean ?
help me out here . don &apos;t argue .
they &apos;re after you ?
we should split up .
you and the kids go . i &apos;ll be somewhere else .
oh , my god .
families don &apos;t get touched . you know that .
i wanna know every night
that you &apos;re not sitting here out in the open .
where should i go ? where will you go ?
the house you bought ,
the estate sale , go there .
jesus .
a hotel , then . it doesn &apos;t matter .
ok .
you all right ?
we gotta get moving .
like i said , it &apos;s just a precaution .
what about your sister ?
she &apos;ll know by now .
we &apos;ll stop over there after we &apos;re cleared out of here .
and gab ? how bad is sil ?
we &apos;ll make some calls .
maybe i should go ahead of you to jan &apos;s .
meadow is basically living at patrick &apos;s .
aj , how will you get him to go along ?
he won &apos;t leave the house .
he &apos;ll leave the house .
tony .
on a piece of plywood
if necessary , but he &apos;s gonna leave the house .
anything i can do ?
no . you heard ?
or maybe i should just leave .
i &apos;ll call you .
it says shukrijumah brought nuclear material
into the country from mexico in 2002 .
fuck .
leave us alone , hon .
hang downstairs .
better yet , don &apos;t .
you just bust in ? we could have been doing anything .
yeah , but what were you doing ? nothing .
we &apos;re just friends .
all right , listen .
come on , sit up .
come on .
your uncle bobby &apos;s dead .
what ?
he &apos;s dead . he got shot .
what do you mean , he got shot ?
listen to me ,
and i don &apos;t have any time to go into a debate about any of this .
and it &apos;s important that we all leave for a little while
until things settle down .
what ? holy fuck .
it &apos;s just a precaution .
the point is
that i &apos;m gonna be dependent on you to help out your mother .
help out how ?
just do what she asks .
you know , chores , tasks ,
whatever .
and don &apos;t add to the problem .
what do you mean ? what the fuck did i do ?
don &apos;t break her balls , all right ?
just help her
with aunt janice , whatever .
uncle bobby &apos;s dead .
yeah .
this is really depressing to me .
he was a good guy .
i was already having so much trouble maintaining ...
my tailbone !
here , pack a bag .
now !
you won &apos;t need no sandals or fucking resort wear .
i &apos;ll be waiting downstairs .
oh , my god .
i called the hospital . they wouldn &apos;t give no info on sil .
gab &apos;s brother finally phoned back .
doctors don &apos;t think he &apos;ll recover consciousness .
look at the stems on blondie .
he &apos;s riding high .
nice to be young .
i &apos;m gonna bunk down here .
all right , you go take care of your wife ,
that flu .
you too .
where the fuck i gotta be ?
yeah , i &apos;m gonna stay .
we order a pizz &apos; ?
yeah .
get some meatballs and sausage .
you probably don &apos;t even hear it when it happens .
