she got into a fight with her foster father ?
which is how she landed here in juvie .
it &apos;s just for a few weeks , right ?
you selling my pills ?
what do you need all that money for anyway ?
i &apos;ve been talking to ana .
our ... birth mom ?
you know , i &apos;m just trying to get back on my feet .
here .
where you going ?
it was my brother .
you &apos;re going to get me sent back to juvie ,
and jude is going to be stuck in that house .
can i help you ?
i was looking for the metro .
the metro &apos;s a few miles from here .
whoa , hey ! what the hell are you doing here ?
i just wanna ...
shut up .
ok , ok , ok ...
put the gun down ! get down on your knees now !
hands on your head !
we are not sending these kids back into that system .
we really don &apos;t have the room .
then we &apos;ll make room .
jesus , the trash needs to go out .
i shouldn &apos;t have to remind you .
i took them out yesterday .
well , it &apos;s full again .
and get off your skateboard , please .
and , it &apos;s not because what you did last night wasn &apos;t really dumb .
and i don &apos;t use those words for lack of bigger ones .
it was really dumb .
my god , what were you thinking ?
running off , chasing after some girl , come on .
even if it was to help her brother .
why didn &apos;t you just call me ?
i know , i know ..
it was a big mistake .
it could have been a fatal mistake , love ,
you had no idea what you were walking into .
could have been much much worse than that .
i mean , it won &apos;t happen again .
you &apos;re damn right it won &apos;t happen again .
i gotta be honest with you , my friend .
i was ready to drop the hammer .
but after talking with lena , we have
decided that you are probably very aware
of the potential consequences of your actions , yes ?
yes .
and this is pretty out of character for you ,
so we are not going to ground you ,
but i am telling you , this will never ever happen again .
hmm , where &apos;s mariana ?
oh , she &apos;s still in the bathroom .
mariana , come on !
let &apos;s go , babe . we &apos;ve gotta eat .
callie , can you put juice out for everybody ?
yeah .
i didn &apos;t have time to do my hair .
well , it &apos;s too late now sweetie .
we still have 15 minutes .
no , no , no . you guys have to walk to school today .
we have a thing .
come on . come eat .
ok , i am not going to school with my hair like this .
well then you &apos;re not going anywhere , ever again .
stef , your pancakes are burning .
great . i get to spend all day looking like a la sabueso .
you want a treat ? good girl .
enough .
ok , guys , you have to be out the door in 10 .
stef and i have a meeting with bill .
and then i &apos;m gonna take jude to come later to school , to show him around .
he &apos;ll be ok . i promise .
i &apos;m not gonna let them split you two up again , ok ?
all right , pancakes everybody . who wants pancakes ?
jude , do you want pancakes ?
i do .
brandon , pass them around , please .
ok , jesus , how many times have we said ,
no skateboard in the house ?
have you taken your pill this morning ?
yes .
no .
no .
jude , dude , come on .
sorry .
some fruit , you guys .
let &apos;s do this !
what are you doing ?
i didn &apos;t have time to dry my hair this morning .
there were like 300 people in the bathroom .
you look fine , i &apos;m sure no one &apos;s going to notice .
what happened to your hair ?
jesus , you idiot !
he may be an idiot , but damn your brother &apos;s so hot .
oh my god , ew .
hey , do you have any more you know what ?
i only have a couple left .
no , and i can &apos;t get any more .
really ?
really .
ok , see you babes at lunch .
bye .
so , what happened last night with your birth mom ?
jesus found out .
he found out ?
did he freak ?
completely .
did he go with you ?
no . he yelled at me .
so , how was it ?
honestly ? it kind of sucked .
well , at least you don &apos;t have to invite her to your quinceanera .
that would &apos;ve been awkward .
come on , we &apos;re going to be late .
have you thought any more about what you want to do ?
about callie and jude ?
mm .
no .
to be honest , i just keep thinking about
seeing you and brandon in that house with a gun ...
we were fine .
i know you were fine .
i know that . but in my mind , when you go to work ,
you are writing parking tickets and pulling cats out of trees .
that &apos;s firemen .
you know what i &apos;m saying .
don &apos;t insult me .
you know what i mean .
i just keep flashing back
to you storming into that house with your gun pulled out ...
it &apos;s what i do , love .
i get this awful feeling in my stomach .
and i cannot help but connect that back to callie .
meaning ?
meaning ,
i know that you said we &apos;re
not going to put them back in the system
but ,
i have some really serious concerns .
that &apos;s bill .
there &apos;s bill .
ok , bye .
hey .
hey , you ...
ah , did i just see callie down the hall ?
i don &apos;t know , did you ?
i &apos;m just surprised is all .
i mean , i figured after last night they would &apos;ve ...
would &apos;ve ?
sent her back to juvie ,
or another foster home or something .
yeah , well , they &apos;re not .
i mean , not now , at least .
mm . good .
you ok ?
totally . i &apos;m fine .
you &apos;re sure ?
brandon , i &apos;m fine .
are we still on for friday ?
it &apos;s not every weekend my parents go out of town .
you know i &apos;m down .
good .
now get to class .
then a few years later , when callie was 10 , i think ...
yes , that &apos;s right .
her mother died suddenly .
her father obviously wasn &apos;t in the picture ,
and there were no other family members to call on .
so , they were put into the system .
unfortunately , they haven &apos;t been able to land anywhere ,
for more than six months at a time .
could i trouble you for some more coffee , please ?
yeah , of course .
now , we keep trying to put them somewhere permanent ,
but then something happens ,
and we have to move them onto somewhere new .
something happens ? what exactly does that mean ?
something like last night ?
i feel terrible about that .
that is my fault .
i had an emergency on another case .
otherwise , i would &apos;ve been there for callie
and connected her with jude ,
and none of that would &apos;ve happened . thank you .
look , they &apos;re really great kids ,
they &apos;ve just had bad luck .
that &apos;s just so heartbreaking .
so you are looking for something permanent for them ?
always .
we already have three teenagers .
what do you think ?
so , the seventh grade classes are mostly on the south corridor .
with all the high school kids ?
yeah .
does that mean i get to see callie ?
well , not all the time , but she &apos;ll be around .
and if you need anything at all , i &apos;m always here , ok ?
hey .
morning .
everything all right ?
hey jude , why don &apos;t you wait out in the hall ,
and i &apos;ll take you to class in a sec .
what &apos;s up ?
so , i was on my way to class
and i found this lying by a trash can .
pills .
well , you know what this means .
locker search . everyone line up .
what &apos;s this ?
it &apos;s ibuprofen . over the counter .
for cramps .
uh , you &apos;re good .
how many kids are you selling to anyway ?
i don &apos;t know , five or six ?
you better hope none of them
are keeping their stash in their lockers .
got the report filed .
good boy .
you driving ?
i &apos;m driving .
ok .
so , that was quite a night ?
yes , it was .
anybody run away this morning ?
that &apos;s funny . no . nope .
gave brandon quite a talking to though .
but i &apos;ve decided not to ground him , so he &apos;s thrilled .
what ? you &apos;re kidding , right ?
no .
the kid basically went awol last night ,
damn near got himself killed .
yeah , exactly . so , lena thought that
he &apos;s very well aware of the consequences and
no benefit to punishing him .
oh , lena thought .
ok , take it easy . easy .
first time he &apos;s ever done anything like this before .
right , which is all the more reason to set boundaries .
we set plenty of boundaries for him .
well , apparently not enough .
god .
look , i &apos;m sure hippie @-@ dippie lena with her
phd in child ... whatever the hell it is ,
has some opinions about why punishing him
would damage his blossoming sense of self ,
but the thing is , stef , i &apos;m his dad .
yes , mike . i &apos;m well aware of that .
right , and you should &apos;ve talked to me about it first .
come on , it &apos;ll be fun .
i told you nobody &apos;d go .
i thought we had a good time .
well , i don &apos;t know what to tell you .
tell me that you &apos;ll go out with me again .
yeah , i don &apos;t think so .
why do you have to be such a bitch ? come on .
hey , she said no , man .
yeah , i heard her .
so , why are you still in her face ? take a walk .
why don &apos;t you just relax , ok ?
why don &apos;t you get out of here ?
watch yourself , crackhead .
what &apos;d you call me ?
jesus , knock it off ... - hey ! what is going on here ?
are you ok ?
finding everything ?
yeah .
ok , good . i just wanted to make sure .
did you see bill ?
yep .
did he say anything ?
like what ?
i don &apos;t know . like anything ?
he said , &quot; hi . &quot;
why ?
just wondering .
now get back in there . learn something .
this is not like you to get into a fight .
i know , i &apos;m sorry .
the guy was being rude to lexi .
ok . so , you can &apos;t have a conversation about that ?
why did this have to get physical ?
i don &apos;t know .
did you take your pill today ?
yeah .
are you sure ?
yeah . a hundred percent .
ok , maybe it &apos;s time we called dr. hitchin &apos;s
and set another appointment .
i don &apos;t need to see ...
can &apos;t i have a bad day once in a while
without being some psych case ?
all right . don &apos;t let this happen again .
if you feel yourself getting worked up ,
just take a deep breath and walk away .
ok ? go to class .
hey , you got in a fight ? lexi told me .
i didn &apos;t take my meds , so i was kind of jumpy .
why aren &apos;t you taking your pills ?
i &apos;m skipping a few days to save your ass
so mom wouldn &apos;t notice the pills are missing .
don &apos;t worry , they didn &apos;t find anything in the lockers ,
so you &apos;re fine .
hey , calm down .
you &apos;re gonna get us both busted .
us or you ?
you &apos;re welcome , by the way .
i was just avoiding the whole &quot; who do i sit with at lunch &quot; thing .
gotcha .
i &apos;ll let you practice .
no , no . you can stay .
are you sure ?
yeah .
so , you &apos;re really not getting grounded or anything ?
are your moms usually that cool
or is it just &apos; cause you never do anything wrong ?
no , i mean , i do stuff .
it &apos;s not like i &apos;ve never got in trouble before .
really ? - yeah .
like ?
like , i ...
i got caught stealing .
yeah ?
yes .
what ?
a car . yeah .
a matchbox when i was five .
yeah . no , you &apos;re bad news .
what ?
nothing . no , i just ...
i wonder how ...
you even know who you are if you just do
what everybody else thinks you should do ?
nice , do you play ?
uh , a little . i used to .
my mom taught me some before she ...
before she ?
lena , honey ?
listen , i &apos;m sorry . mike is right behind me .
why is mike coming over ?
because he thinks we should
have a discussion , a conversation perhaps , in regards to brandon .
mike and i , we were talking at work and ...
he feels that perhaps ,
we &apos;ve gone a little too easy on brandon ,
and that he may indeed need some sort of punishment .
ok , i hear that .
but unfortunately , we already spoke to brandon .
we can speak to him again .
mike , i think that brandon really understands
the consequences of his actions and there &apos;s no value ...
with all due respect , what you think isn &apos;t really my concern ...
hey , wait a minute , mike . lena is his parent , too .
respectfully , that may be true .
but i am his father and you &apos;re his mother .
excuse me ?
you know what i mean .
i know what you mean .
what do you think ?
lena , you know that i think you are his mother , too .
no , that &apos;s fine . that &apos;s fine .
i &apos;m not his mother , i &apos;m not his father .
mike is right .
no , he is not right .
what do you think about brandon &apos;s punishment ?
i think that mike has a point .
hey , bud .
what &apos;s up ?
what are we talking about ?
we &apos;re having a discussion right now .
the three of us , if you don &apos;t mind .
actually , we &apos;re talking about your punishment .
but i thought i wasn &apos;t punished .
you are . you &apos;re grounded , one week .
school and home , that &apos;s it .
what ? no , but i made plans .
oh , you made plans .
yeah .
oh , that &apos;s funny ,
&apos;cause you didn &apos;t have any trouble blowing off
your plans to be at the music competition , did you ?
ok , and since when do you even care ?
excuse me ?
brandon ?
where have you been ? no , no , seriously , dad .
when do you even care ? you &apos;re never around .
when have you ever cared ? you call me once ,
like every two days , five minute phone calls .
why should i even listen to you ?
great . this is awesome .
let me know who i &apos;m supposed to be taking orders from .
that went well .
honey , listen , that &apos;s ...
... not supposed to be the way ...
i &apos;m listening to that .
you can &apos;t skip your pills .
well , what do you want me to do ?
thanks to someone i seem to be missing a whole bunch .
you got a better idea ?
you still have a few left , right ?
how many ? like a week or so ?
like , three .
ok , how about this ...
you keep taking them and you take them till you run out ,
and we can tell moms you dropped the rest down the sink .
yeah , ok . fine .
in case i haven &apos;t said it ...
you haven &apos;t .
well , i &apos;m sorry . for all of this .
it &apos;s cool .
sixteen .
and this one ?
no , you know that . what do you have to do ?
you have to divide it by the &quot; y. &quot;
it &apos;s four . the answer &apos;s four . you should &apos;ve known that .
you should &apos;ve known that .
i did know that .
no , you didn &apos;t .
yeah , i did .
uh @-@ uh .
yeah !
so cheeky !
stop it !
no , you stop it .
how long are we going to be here ?
i don &apos;t know , kid .
finish your homework .
ok .
i am sorry i ambushed you , lena . all right ?
this was something that mike felt very strongly about , obviously .
when you feel like talking to me , lena .
let me know .
i thought we were on the same page . i thought we agreed .
i &apos;ve never felt like such a stepmother in my entire life .
lena ...
and just so we &apos;re clear ,
i am done disciplining
brandon if this is the way it &apos;s going to be from now on .
i &apos;m just going to be good @-@ time stepmom from now on .
you want some candy , brandon ? sure , help yourself !
want some cigarettes ? smoke it up ! lung cancer be damned !
want some booze ? no ? how about some heroin ?
oh , wow . point taken . please put down the knife .
you &apos;re scaring me . lena .
come on , love . what was i supposed to do ?
mike is brandon &apos;s father . this was a big decision
and we didn &apos;t include him in it .
can you imagine how you would feel if something like this
happened with mariana or jesus ?
it &apos;s not the same thing .
mike is not the twins father .
obviously .
you know that &apos;s not what i meant .
you would not like it ...
if parental decisions
were being made without me ...
without you .
yes , i get that , but in what world is it ok for you
to take mike &apos;s side in front of me ?
i didn &apos;t take his side , lena . i simply said ...
you humiliated me in front of him .
i &apos;m sorry , that is not what i meant to do .
but you asked , what was i supposed to say ?
you lie , stef . you lie .
ok , i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s not easy for me either , you know .
it &apos;s no fun playing peacekeeper between you and mike
when you &apos;re acting like israel and palestine .
it kind of stinks .
look , brandon has three parents , period .
no getting around it . mike had no right to say otherwise .
i know that &apos;s not what he thinks , i really do .
and we &apos;re all just trying to do our best to
figure this out .
i &apos;m going to go talk to brandon . all right ?
we &apos;re ok for now ?
we &apos;re good .
great .
b ?
yeah ?
i get that you &apos;re frustrated ,
it seems to be a common theme around the house these days .
but , that &apos;s no reason to talk to your father that way .
he &apos;s a good man , he &apos;s a good dad ,
and he does care very , very much , he always has .
i know , i know . i &apos;m sorry .
you &apos;re sorry ?
i &apos;m sorry .
i didn &apos;t mean any of it .
it &apos;s just ...
i know .
you know what you need to do .
by the way , lena wants you to know ,
that if you ever need any heroin , she &apos;s happy to help .
never mind , that was funnier in my head .
i &apos;m sorry .
oh , you playing again ?
i remember the day you bought that .
saved up all your money ,
all on your own , i was so proud of you .
call your dad .
yeah .
hi . dinner is not quite ready yet .
do you want something to drink or ... ?
is everything ok ?
yeah , i was just wondering if you had any chores for me .
chores ?
yeah , well , foster families are gonna send us away right away ,
they usually give us chores and stuff .
you know what ?
you could really help me ...
i forgot the salad forks .
so , are you and stef married ?
well , not exactly .
not legally , no .
we &apos;re married in our hearts , i guess .
that &apos;s basically the same thing , right ?
basically , yeah .
everyone , grab a seat .
so , we have something to talk about , obviously .
uh , stef and i had our meeting with bill ,
and we &apos;ve come to a decision .
we are not in a position to offer jude and callie a home forever .
but we would like you guys
to be as comfortable and safe as possible ,
until bill does find you a permanent home .
however long that may take .
it could be a week , it could be a year .
we just don &apos;t know .
we want this to be your very last way station
ever , ever , ever . ok ?
so , that means , we need to get you guys out of the living room .
i think you &apos;ll be ok to camp down there one more night ,
but tomorrow we &apos;re having some beds delivered .
so after school let &apos;s help get them settled in , ok ?
yes , brandon and jesus , could use a little muscle , all right ?
jude , my sweet , new , young friend .
you &apos;ll be moving in with jesus .
and callie , you &apos;ll be moving into mariana &apos;s room , all right ?
hey mariana , lexi &apos;s here .
i just wanted to say thanks .
i know you were just trying to stick up for me .
i ... i didn &apos;t mean to yell at you .
you didn &apos;t have to go all iron man on his ass ,
but , you know , thank you .
what are you doing ? come on , i need your help .
i have to get rid of a bunch of stuff
so callie can move into my room .
it &apos;s a freaking nightmare .
seriously , i don &apos;t understand
why they just can &apos;t move into the dining room ?
it &apos;s not like we ever use it , right ?
oh yeah , yeah , year .
maybe we can put them in the closet
or under the stairs , like in harry potter ?
i mean , come on guys . let &apos;s think about how they must feel .
they &apos;re not here forever .
let &apos;s try to make them feel a little more welcome .
easy for you to say . you &apos;re not giving up anything .
lexi , come here .
wait , what do you mean ? i thought you weren &apos;t getting grounded ?
what about callie ?
if you &apos;re getting punished ,
is she going back to juvie ?
no . no , she &apos;s actually
going to be living with us for a while now .
wait ... you &apos;re not jealous , are you ?
of callie ? no .
ok . &apos; cause you have no reason to be .
yeah , obviously . you know , that &apos;s cool of your moms .
letting her stay .
she was just trying to help save her brother , right ?
yeah .
brandon called you , right ?
yeah , said he was sorry .
good .
he was kind of right , though .
no , he was not . he was not right to talk to you ...
not about the me not caring part .
i mean , look , when was the last time that you and lena
really talked to me about brandon ?
ok , listen , mike . you &apos;re right . we have ...
no , no , no . i &apos;m not blaming you .
i &apos;m not saying it &apos;s your fault .
that &apos;s not what i mean .
you guys are so good and involved and there all the time .
i just feel like it was so easy to turn the reins over .
i don &apos;t want to do that any more , stef .
i don &apos;t want to hand my kid over .
i don &apos;t want to be some half @-@ assed version of a dad .
you &apos;re not a half @-@ assed version of a dad .
i know , but you know what i mean .
you guys know she just got out of juvie , right ?
kelsey , i told you not to tell anyone .
i know , but i think that they should know .
watch out , she &apos;ll totally shiv you or something .
shank .
a shiv is a thing , a shank &apos;s what you do with it .
my mom &apos;s a cop .
damn girl , it &apos;s like grand theft auto around your place .
seriously .
hey callie ! over here .
so , how are you ?
i mean , i know it &apos;s been a crazy couple of days for you .
uh , no , i &apos;m fine . thanks .
so , where are you from ?
just around .
uh @-@ huh . great .
is that your brother you were talking to this morning ?
yeah , that &apos;s jude .
wow , he &apos;s totally adorable .
ah , he &apos;s all right .
i like your bracelets .
thank you .
i should get some like that . so cool .
yeah , i really like your scarf .
so , how long are you guys gonna be here for ?
a couple weeks , a month ... six months ?
i have no idea .
it &apos;s not really up to me .
right ... &apos; cause we should get you in some clubs .
you know , so you can meet more people .
it &apos;s got to be hella boring
hanging out with brandon all the time .
you &apos;d know a lot about that .
right ? we &apos;re together pretty much all the time .
stef and lena are so supportive of our relationship .
stef even buys his condoms .
hello ! how great is that ?
oh , it &apos;s really great .
so ...
i just ...
yes .
so , i wasn &apos;t really right in the head yesterday .
meaning ...
meaning , um , i probably shouldn &apos;t have ...
it &apos;s cool .
but you probably shouldn &apos;t
go kissing me every time you have a bad day .
oh yeah ? who said you &apos;re the only girl i kissed yesterday ?
oh , really ?
really .
you got a little ...
what is it and who gave it to you ?
you can tell me or we can call the police
and you can tell them .
it &apos;s up to you .
what &apos;s it gonna be , kelsey ? where &apos;d you get the drugs ?
where is she ?
this one kid , connor , was pretty nice , though .
they &apos;re reading this book ,
a wrinkle in ... something .
time ?
huh ?
a wrinkle in time .
oh yeah , that &apos;s it .
anyways , i don &apos;t get it . it &apos;s kind of confusing .
what ?
why are both my moms home ?
what &apos;s going on ?
mariana , could you take jude upstairs , please ?
we need to talk to callie .
yeah , sweets , it &apos;s ok . she &apos;ll be right up .
callie ?
we &apos;ve been told that you stole jesus &apos;s pills ?
and have been selling them at school ? is it true ?
is this true ?
no .
you sure about that ?
then why would this student say that you did ?
i guess i &apos;m just an easy target .
right .
will you give us a minute , please ?
so , what do we do ?
i don &apos;t know , maybe we should call mike .
oh , yes , feisty .
i &apos;m trying , love .
i know .
mike didn &apos;t mean ...
i know , i know .
mike called me , we talked .
really , what &apos;d he say ?
that &apos;s between me and mike .
so , did you ask talya to have lunch with callie ?
wait , what ? they had lunch ?
talya has lost her mind .
she &apos;s insecure , bro .
i mean , suddenly you got this hot 16 year old girl ...
you think callie &apos;s hot ?
you don &apos;t ?
i better figure something out ,
or talya &apos;s going to have a complete meltdown on me .
better do something big .
make her feel special , you know ?
but i &apos;m grounded , remember ?
improvise .
hey , you didn &apos;t make any plans tonight , right ?
no , good , don &apos;t . i ...
i &apos;m gonna sneak out , and come see you .
no , i don &apos;t care if i get in trouble . it &apos;s worth it .
ok . bye .
where &apos;s jude ?
he &apos;s reading magazines in my room . he &apos;s ok .
good .
i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m gonna tell him .
so , what happened ?
they think that i stole your brother &apos;s pills .
what did you tell them ?
well , i didn &apos;t tell them that it was you ,
if that &apos;s what you &apos;re asking me .
why not ?
as if they &apos;d believe me .
are you really going to let callie take the fall for you ?
they &apos;re gonna send her away .
they &apos;re gonna be so mad at me .
the other night ,
when ana just took all that money from me
like i was an atm or something ,
not even a person , much less her daughter .
i thought , &quot; well , hey ...
&quot; at least , i have two moms at home who love me . &quot;
they &apos;re gonna hate me .
they &apos;re not gonna hate you .
i promise .
they &apos;re totally going to cancel my quinceanera .
will you come with me to tell them ?
surprised you want to consort with a known drug trafficker .
well , did you do it ?
what do you think ?
i think you &apos;re playing the g chord wrong .
try the six string on the third fret .
there you go .
thank you ... for the guitar .
you &apos;re welcome .
i can &apos;t remember anything .
i think that was a c there .
i was right ?
here .
and then , i think if you move these two down ,
you &apos;ll make another chord there .
nice .
hi .
it was me , i did it .
did what ?
the pills .
ok .
you care to explain ?
i was feeling like a freak .
just tired of being the kid with add .
everyone always asking me , &quot; did you take your pill ? &quot;
&quot; did you take your pill ? &quot;
you know , so i stopped .
i started hiding them in my pocket .
kelsey saw them at school
and she told me she heard they make you really smart ,
and really focused .
she needed some for a paper she had to write .
so , i gave her one .
and some more .
and things just got out of hand .
g , c ...
i don &apos;t know , just ...
hey brandon ,
will you excuse us for a sec ?
uh , yeah .
it would appear that we were given
some false information .
and i promise i &apos;m going to find out how that happened exactly .
yeah , we &apos;re very sorry that we didn &apos;t believe you .
we feel that trust is something that has to be earned .
right ?
we would really like to start earning yours .
yeah .
ok .
all right . let &apos;s go .
i &apos;m glad we &apos;re staying . i like it here .
yeah ?
don &apos;t like it too much .
god , i can &apos;t remember anything .
just keep trying .
i mean , it &apos;ll come back .
