so what was it ?
severe allergic reaction .
oh , he did it on purpose .
he &apos;s suicidal ?
he &apos;s homicidal .
i &apos;ve found there ain &apos;t much difference .
you know , i never have figured out why they call you in .
what &apos;s the point of saving a scumbag like this ?
he &apos;ll only kill someone else the second he gets a chance .
that &apos;s above my pay grade .
overcrowded anyway .
you think the taxpayers want to save this idiot ?
put it down .
don &apos;t you go doing nothing stupid , boy .
&apos;cause i &apos;ll tell you why .
they &apos;ll never let you out of that damn hole again .
put ... it ... down .
that &apos;s it .
that &apos;s it , boy .
that &apos;s it .
ok , you never give your vote on who should get what .
give reid the mug .
really ? that means that jj gets the double @-@ decker bus ?
i thought that was for kevin .
no , we &apos;re not talking right now .
garcia , you guys were just talking yest--
never mind .
wait , where is everybody ?
don &apos;t tell me they &apos;re still in seattle .
you guys are back . hi .
oh , my made it . give me a squeeze .
oh , you guys look great .
how &apos;s it going ?
cheers .
how &apos;s emily doing ?
brilliant and lovely .
her apartment &apos;s off the chain .
you mean her flat .
you have to take a shaky old lift to get to the top ,
but the view is brilliant .
for my favorite bloke .
hey , i love it ! thank you !
thanks .
how was temporary duty ?
oh , it was around the clock .
i thought i &apos;d get a little more of a vacation , but ...
did you watch the olympics at all ?
i did see a little track and field ,
but the queen bee here , she saw everything .
emily is for real hooked up over there .
she sends her love . and tea of the month starts next week .
ohh . i miss her .
don &apos;t even get me started .
hey , how &apos;s the new ? is she nice ?
yeah , she is .
i &apos;m just asking .
reid , do you know when she was recruited she was 24 ?
i &apos;ve guest lectured in her forensic linguistics class before .
of course you have , &apos; cause she &apos;s a professor and an agent ,
which is so impressive .
no , really , she &apos;s great .
and driven , clearly .
berkeley grad , double major ,
bureau star of the unabomber case .
and she teaches at georgetown .
when she &apos;s not doing that , she &apos;s ssaing at the washington field office ,
and she has her phd .
does that mean i have to call her doctor ? what ? !
i did some research on her &apos; cause i couldn &apos;t sleep on the plane .
and my point is , clearly ,
she is smart and capable , but is she nice ?
oh , dear god , this is happening ,
where i talk and the person is behind ...
me .
the origin of &quot; nice &quot;
is 12th century middle english , meaning foolish or stupid .
i hope you &apos;re referring to the modern use of the adjective .
you must be penelope .
i &apos;m alex blake .
nice to meet you .
really , actually nice in the nicest of ways nice .
i &apos;m derek morgan .
welcome back .
how was seattle ?
the unsub made ridgeway look like a saint .
he even used his own kid to bait the victims .
well , we &apos;ve seen that before . no doubt we &apos;ll see it again .
don &apos;t unpack .
garcia , the files .
yeah . the files . oh , god .
a few hours ago there was a prison transfer
to the county hospital in abilene , texas .
the ambulance crashed and the prisoner escaped .
he &apos;s wearing the emt uniform ,
and he &apos;s armed with the guard &apos;s weapon .
aren &apos;t the u.s. marshals on this ?
yes , they are , but they need your help
because this is what they found inside .
the emt and the driver died in the accident .
the guard , however , suffocated .
what &apos;s on his mouth ?
it was sewn shut .
so the prisoner is the silencer .
or this guy &apos;s a copycat .
forensics confirmed it &apos;s the same unique double @-@ knot ligature
he used in all 3 murders .
his last known victim was in 2004
and he was never caught .
so he didn &apos;t go dormant by choice . he was locked up .
well , why not just escape ?
if he hadn &apos;t sewn the guard &apos;s mouth shut ,
we would never know it was him .
he wants us to know he &apos;s back .
we &apos;ve got his face . what &apos;s his name ?
john doe . he was pulled over in &apos; 04 for a traffic violation .
no registration , no tags . he carried no i.d.
no way he did 8 years for that .
they searched the car and found a gun with a silencer .
a silencer . he was practically telling them who he was
and no one made the connection .
it &apos;s a federal offense , carries a 30 @-@ year minimum sentence .
but it was actually what he did inside
that guaranteed him life without parole .
he killed two men while inside .
and never said a word .
he spoke with his fists .
remaining silent for 8 years takes a hell of a lot of self @-@ restraint .
maybe it was a conditioned response .
garcia &apos;s gathering all the files from &apos; 04 .
we &apos;ll catch up on the plane . wheels up in 30 .
alex .
i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t get a chance to see you before the seattle case .
congratulations .
it took a lot of hard work to get a shot here .
it wasn &apos;t easy .
it &apos;s been a long time .
i &apos;ve got a plane to catch , erin .
good luck .
&quot; as i grow older , i pay less attention to what men say .
i just watch what they do . &quot;
andrew carnegie .
did any of you work on the silencer case ?
that was during my extended sabbatical .
we all consulted , but nobody made the trip to texas .
why not ? 3 women in 4 months .
it &apos;s a textbook kill rate .
an undeniable signature .
obvious surrogates .
we weren &apos;t invited by the local police .
aren &apos;t you tired of that ?
welcome to our world .
the women he killed were beaten and left in open ditches .
that physical representation of his anger is missing this time around .
he must do something else that satisfies him .
the signature is the same ,
but his victimology couldn &apos;t be more different .
the guard was clearly a victim of necessity .
but if he &apos;s in need @-@ driven behavior
such as sewing mouths shut , how can he control that
and only do it to the guard ?
maybe he just ran out of time .
or he could want the guard to suffer in silence .
literally makes his victims shut up .
it seems obvious , but , uh , there may be something to that .
then the question is why ?
morgan , you and jj go to the m.e.
reid , you and dave check out john doe &apos;s cell .
blake and i will head to the u.s. marshals .
this is hotchner and blake .
bob tilghman . thank you for coming .
i got my whole team on this .
any leads yet ?
well , the wreck happened
out on the middle of nowhere after midnight .
the sun comes up at 6 : 00 . so we figure that he &apos;s on foot
somewhere within a 12 @-@ mile radius of the accident site .
you think he &apos;s moving on foot in this heat ?
well , it &apos;ll kill you under the best conditions .
he stole some supplies , but not enough to hole up too long .
so you can expect him to be active tonight .
well , where can we set up ?
right in here .
passing any coffee by chance ?
i just started a pot .
we got his picture plastered everywhere .
but if he &apos;s hiding , he &apos;s hiding .
it &apos;s gonna be awful hard to weed him out .
i &apos;m not good at waiting .
neither am i.
we &apos;ve been keeping the media at bay .
we don &apos;t want them to know too much .
you should try to keep it that way .
what &apos;s all this ?
his first crimes .
they mean more to us now
that he &apos;s killed again .
so he came out just as sick as he went in .
you think he &apos;s gonna move or wait ?
well , he kills at night ,
which means that &apos;s when he &apos;s most confident .
if waiting for dark is the smartest move , that &apos;s what he &apos;ll do .
everything points to a solitary existence .
you know , interestingly enough ,
the most worn book is &quot; the count of monte cristo . &quot;
of course it is .
the hero &apos;s only reason for living
was to seek vengeance . maybe he relates .
it &apos;s in french .
i didn &apos;t see that coming .
looks like he wrote a lot too .
he &apos;s been pent up physically and verbally far too long .
so he gets into his first fight within days of being here .
it got him a week &apos;s worth of solitary .
that pattern escalated until he eventually killed an inmate ,
got out of solitary and killed another .
so he silences his victims before he gets inside .
his actions get him silenced while he &apos;s here .
ironic ?
fortuitous .
looks like he has two forms of expression--
silence and rage .
we need to find out why he &apos;s operating in these extremes .
maybe it &apos;s in his writings .
the suture is 6 @-@ zero nylon , p @-@ 3 needle ,
13 @-@ millimeter long , 3 / 8 circle .
a dozen of these would come in a box .
the suture drawer was empty on the ambulance .
then he &apos;s got a lot more .
his technique isn &apos;t like a mortician .
it looks like the stitching is strictly through the lips .
it &apos;s rather crude what he &apos;s done .
you see how the nylon is stretched ?
the victim struggled ,
which says the prisoner did it while this guy was still alive .
torture .
just like the first victims .
well , now that you &apos;ve seen his handiwork ,
i &apos;ll open his mouth .
what do we have here ?
&quot; gazing through to the other side . &quot;
that &apos;s not much of a taunt .
maybe it &apos;s not for us .
then who ?
what do you think ?
can i retract an earlier statement ?
sure .
there &apos;s nothing textbook about this case .
these victims suffered in ways that were painstakingly personal .
you think he was abused the same way ?
doubt his mouth was sewn .
that &apos;s his way of expressing frustration .
but there &apos;s something tied to the silence .
i &apos;m thinking he stayed quiet in prison
because he was ridiculed as a child when he talked .
by someone who looked like them .
he could have had a speech impediment .
it would have been severe-- a stutter maybe .
we &apos;ve got ourself a reader over here .
in multiple languages .
spanish , english , and german
are the primary languages for texas .
he reads in french , but most of his own writings are in english .
his handwriting is the size of courier type ,
and so far i &apos;ve read 50,000 words .
and ?
the small print tells me he &apos;s methodical ,
not always social .
the narrow spacing indicates a tremendous amount of irritability .
it looks like stream of consciousness .
interesting . his reading comprehension
suggests above @-@ average intelligence ,
but his writing is inferior .
could be what he grew up hearing .
you two should guest @-@ lecture together .
oh , wait .
he literally put words in the guard &apos;s mouth .
that &apos;s new .
well , we think this is what we were missing .
the words give him the pleasure the beatings used to bring .
maybe we had this wrong .
what if the ritual is sewing the mouths shut ?
his signature used to be the beatings ,
but now it &apos;s putting words in their mouths .
just when you think a signature doesn &apos;t get more solid than that .
what did he write ?
&quot; gazing through to the other side . &quot;
it &apos;s not an anagram .
is that a phrase in anything you &apos;ve read so far ?
no . it &apos;s not a well @-@ known literary reference either .
well , the words mean something to him ,
otherwise he wouldn &apos;t share it .
it &apos;s gonna get dark soon . he &apos;ll be on the move .
you want us on the road with the marshals ?
no , i think we should concentrate on remote locations .
he &apos;s not just escaping detection , he &apos;s a recluse .
he &apos;ll be attracted to isolated locations .
what are you doing ?
hey ! i said , what are you doing ? !
answer me !
you dumb son of a bitch !
we have all the highways covered ,
roadblocks on the rural routes .
he must have stolen a vehicle and just laid low .
how &apos;d you know to look here ?
it &apos;s local and isolated , just like him .
they found the emt &apos;s shirt in the trash .
great . so we don &apos;t know how he &apos;s dressed .
just the fact that he stole wheels from the garage here .
i don &apos;t know what kind of car to look for
because i don &apos;t know what was here .
found some names and numbers .
my guess is these are customers whose cars they were working on .
any makes or models ?
parts ordered . that &apos;s about it .
so the attendant &apos;s motorcycle is still out front .
why didn &apos;t he take that ? he could have gone off road .
it would have been faster .
yeah , but he can sleep in a car .
all right .
well , this place isn &apos;t far from last night &apos;s accident .
6 miles away .
the choppers and the dogs covered this area ,
but he still got away .
you ever seen a fugitive stay this close for so long ?
just depends on how patient he is and what he has to prove .
&quot; waiting on the taste of honey ,
the smell of summer . &quot;
what the hell is that supposed to mean ?
sounds like a list of things he missed when he was locked up ?
why does he need us to know that ?
call blake . bring her up to speed .
you have not called me all day .
seriously ?
now that superwoman is on the case , you don &apos;t need me , huh ?
ok , you know what ? i &apos;m gonna chalk that up to a little jet lag
and let &apos;s start this thing over .
ring ring . i &apos;m looking for my baby girl .
your wish is my command .
there you go . that &apos;s much better .
i need blake &apos;s number .
seriously ? ! are you kidding ? !
hotch asked me to call her .
so call reid . he &apos;s probably glued to her .
all right , that is unnecessary roughness .
you , my sweet , need to settle down .
no , i know , i know .
i just--i ...
i thought this would be easier .
i know . so did i.
garcia , blake &apos;s number ?
just sent you her v @-@ card .
thank you , my lady .
you &apos;re welcome , my love .
blake .
hey , it &apos;s morgan .
get another note ?
yep .
mind if i put you on speaker ?
that &apos;s how we do it .
&quot; waiting on the taste of honey ... the smell of summer . &quot;
&quot; and the sight of the other side . &quot;
3 of the senses . we &apos;re only missing sound and touch .
this guy &apos;s like jekyll and hyde .
writes a decent thought and then sews it in the mouth .
whatever he is ,
he &apos;s romanticizing the hell out of this .
thanks , morgan .
sure .
&quot; gazing through to the other side ,
waiting on the taste of honey , the smell of summer . &quot;
do you think he &apos;s telling us about a place ?
well , it sounds like it .
but ...
where ?
we can &apos;t tell you exactly where this unsub &apos;s going
or what he &apos;s thinking ,
but his actions will betray his intentions .
and how &apos;s that ?
earlier tonight at the gas station ,
he could have stolen money , but the cash register wasn &apos;t empty .
that tells us that he &apos;s not planning a long road trip .
and yet he &apos;s logical enough to be in survival mode .
so logic tells him to escape . i get that .
but what the hell makes him sew mouths shut ?
it &apos;s a compulsion over which he has no control .
so how do we stop him ?
well , truth shows itself through actions .
what &apos;s this guy &apos;s truth ? he feels silenced .
agent hotchner has a theory that he had a speech impediment
that made him embarrassed to talk .
he may have been relentlessly teased because of it .
his prior victims tell us a woman ,
likely a mother figure , is to blame .
chances are she was abusive and convinced him
that whatever words he had were worthless .
this guy hasn &apos;t spoken a word in 8 years .
could he be mute ?
definitely not .
you sound pretty damn sure .
he refers to ipa in a few of his personal writings .
what &apos;s ipa ?
international phonetic alphabet .
it represents only those qualities of speech that are in spoken language .
it &apos;s proof that he &apos;s able to hear ,
which means most likely he can talk but chooses not to .
then what &apos;s he use it for ?
he uses multiple languages ,
which highlights his desire to communicate .
ipa is an interesting choice .
i &apos;ve found that those who understand something as detailed as that
are also proficient in sign language .
so these words that he &apos;s leaving in the mouth
are directly taunting us ?
those messages--
have not been analyzed yet .
not to change the subject , but he &apos;s incredibly well read ,
which tells us that he most likely grew up in isolation ,
with literature being his only escape .
his own writings are not as profound ,
and despite his reading comprehension ,
we don &apos;t believed he &apos;s had an extended education .
everything about his psychosis
says the spoken word has value .
it also greatly angers him .
and if he was yelled at or made to feel stupid ,
he held on to his anger until he snapped .
so why hasn &apos;t he fled the area ?
i mean , he knows there &apos;s a manhunt going on here .
wouldn &apos;t he want to get as far away as possible ?
well , he could be on a mission .
we just don &apos;t know if that mission includes a person or a place .
but we do know his target is close to here .
thank you .
excuse me . blake .
wouldn &apos;t you agree that his messages are relevant to the profile ?
to a degree , yes .
a degree ?
he basically signed his name to the murders .
he &apos;s never left word before .
that &apos;s a significant change of behavior ,
but you completely dismissed it .
because the marshals have their own agenda
and will believe it &apos;s a taunt no matter what we tell them .
we don &apos;t need to give them any more fuel .
if the unsub needs to get his thoughts out ,
it &apos;s like he &apos;s reminding us of something ,
and until we know what that something is ,
i &apos;m not comfortable speculating in front of them .
well , how about the rest of us ?
dr. reid and i are coming up with theories .
you &apos;re welcome to join us .
i don &apos;t know where this scar came from .
well , he got into 23 fights over 8 years .
it &apos;s bound to leave a few marks .
yeah , i know , but i read the records ,
and there &apos;s no indication of a scar behind his left ear .
what are you thinking ? self @-@ inflicted ?
it could be .
the left side of his face is sagging in both photos .
maybe he had a stroke or palsy ?
so a facial deformity , a possible speech impediment .
that leads to pretty low self @-@ esteem .
how does 8 years locked up change someone ?
it takes away their voice .
but it doesn &apos;t take away his rage .
time only makes it worse .
what if he started all those fights so he could be punished ?
he was looking for quiet .
so getting into fights wasn &apos;t about his rage .
it was about getting what he wanted .
silence .
daddy will be right back .
marshal , where are the parents ?
father &apos;s in the stall dead . no sign of the mother .
he stole the victim &apos;s i.d. , so i have no idea who he is
or what type of vehicle we &apos;re looking for .
was there another message ?
they &apos;re looking right now .
this baby is only a few months old .
he &apos;s too young to hold the bottle by himself .
maybe the father fed him .
you wouldn &apos;t take the baby out of
the safety of your car in the middle of the night .
then you &apos;re telling me this guy killed a man
then came out here to care for the baby ?
that &apos;s exactly what he did .
he stayed with him while he slept
and then gave him his pacifier .
well , then maybe he &apos;s not that far away .
there were no words left in the mouth this time .
i think caring for the baby is his message .
then he must relate to the child .
maybe he &apos;s obsessed with the nurture he didn &apos;t get .
or simply wanted him to be quiet .
he &apos;s telling us he has boundaries ?
no , he &apos;s too unstable for that .
i &apos;d consider him lucky .
scissors ...
suture kits , medical tape .
what &apos;s he trying to tell us ?
that he &apos;s finished killing ?
he left his tools behind .
that usually means you &apos;re gonna call it quits .
he didn &apos;t leave the stolen gun .
he &apos;s not giving up .
ok , so he leaves words until today .
maybe he &apos;s closer to what he &apos;s looking for ?
he could have already found it .
if he feels satisfied , he may disappear .
we &apos;re too close to let that happen .
all right , then we go back to the first kills .
3 women , late 40s , all working class .
mothers , brunettes ,
beaten and left in a ditch .
that was his message . he hated them .
maybe he &apos;s not targeting women anymore
because he &apos;s already killed the person he blames .
most likely his mother .
we should have garcia run
all of the victims &apos; names again .
at your service .
pull up the &apos; 04 victims .
done .
all right , we need a list of their children .
ok , next of kin , state welfare ,
give me a sec .
gotcha ! ok .
some were put into foster care after their moms died ,
runaways , truancy , not good .
any incarcerated ?
a handful . do you have any more parameters ?
uh , not yet . just send us the list .
comin &apos; at ya now .
all right , let &apos;s start with the first victim .
julie myers .
3 boys-- mark , greg , and john .
born &apos; 70 , &apos; 72 , &apos; 74 .
history of truancy .
child services lost track of them .
is there any family history of cajun french ?
julie myers was born in new orleans .
could explain his interest in language .
let &apos;s jump ahead to his most recent behavior .
he leaves all of this behind .
is it his version of surrender ?
what &apos;s the medical tape for ?
he didn &apos;t use it on any of the victims .
yet is was important enough for him to steal from the ambulance .
maybe he &apos;s using it on himself .
we said that he may have some kind of nerve damage .
if that &apos;s the case , his eye won &apos;t shut by itself .
maybe he has to tape it down .
it &apos;s his left eye , the same side where the recent scars are .
under his ear .
what if he was trying to stop from hearing .
that &apos;s pretty severe , taking a knife to your own head .
he may have had an implant .
the electronic pulses enhance natural sound .
if all he wants is peace , an implant is like having
a speaker that goes to 11 .
that was fast .
any of the children have a cochlear implant ?
uh , 1988 , john myers .
he was 14 at the time .
yeah , his mom was
paid 650 bucks for the medical trial .
was he deaf before that ?
had to be in order to participate .
人工耳蜗植入项目宣告失败
yikes . it was a highly experimental procedure .
it was tested on humans and not animals .
caused quite the controversy .
so mom gives him the gift of hearing
and it turns out to be a curse .
spent his first 14 years in silence ,
gets lost in the world through books ,
learns languages-- anything to escape .
he &apos;s content , and then his
mom gets paid to use him as a guinea pig .
and now he can &apos;t turn the noise off .
he blamed her and wanted her to suffer .
i told you to clean your room .
you &apos;re an idiot .
you ...
i told you not to look at me !
don &apos;t look at me !
hey ! hey . i told you to do the dishes .
oh , you deaf and dumb son of a bitch .
hey , you deaf dumb son of a bitch !
look at me .
talk to me !
use your mouth !
these messages don &apos;t have a sense of geography ,
so he isn &apos;t leaving us a road map to his happy place .
they rarely do .
i don &apos;t think the writing is his own .
you said it wasn &apos;t written in any literature .
the phrasing is unnatural to the written word .
it &apos;s like an oral recollection .
like a campfire
story about paradise .
one that he &apos;s searching for .
and if he can &apos;t find it , he &apos;ll kill again .
if these aren &apos;t his words , whose are they ?
we need to find out who his neighbors were in prison .
he spent more time in solitary than he did in his own cell .
it &apos;s total darkness but not complete silence .
the inmates can speak through the walls .
let &apos;s see which fellow inmates did time in solitary
when he was there .
i can &apos;t imagine that someone thrown in solitary
is nice enough to tell campfire stories .
some inmates get put there for their own protection .
that &apos;s true . we should start with those prisoners .
hold on . see how he wrote &quot; waiting on the taste of honey . &quot;
it &apos;s got southern u.s. roots ,
but more specifically , it &apos;s texas south ,
a sub @-@ dialect of southern english
found in the north @-@ central part of the state .
right here--you wait for something that hasn &apos;t shown up ,
you wait on something that &apos;s nearby .
then the taste of honey would be close .
yes , and the storyteller is probably from north of here .
fewer were thrown in the hole than you think .
go ahead , garcia .
our unsub was the mvp of solitary .
he was in there more than any other prisoner .
all right , we &apos;re looking for somebody who didn &apos;t belong in jail .
his offense would be minimal .
he might even be there for his own protection .
i got a few .
can you read off the hometowns ?
sure . beaumont ,
edinburgh , sweetwater--
sweetwater . who was that inmate ?
danny tucker . looks like he was only in for 2 months .
well , it &apos;s long enough to tell stories to john myers .
hey , his family owns property
near where you are . it &apos;s really secluded , too .
with local honey , by any chance ?
they are known for it .
that &apos;s where he &apos;s headed .
garcia , is it a private property ?
it was , but it &apos;s been sold .
they &apos;re building a housing development .
so it &apos;s not the hideaway he hopes it &apos;s going to be .
where would he go ?
he might blame danny for lying to him . garcia .
danny &apos;s house is down the road from the development .
i &apos;m sending his address to your phones now .
all right , dave , you and reid go to the site .
the rest of us will go to danny &apos;s house .
hey , i &apos;m home .
where &apos;s everybody ?
laura ?
what the hell ?
danny ...
ok . ok .
we don &apos;t have any money .
but , uh ... you can take my truck .
here &apos;s the keys .
go ahead , now . go on .
i &apos;m not gonna tell anybody about this .
just go on .
danny , watch out ! danny !
oh , god . what are you doing ?
somebody help us .
you &apos;re on speaker , garcia .
hey , i was doing some digging &apos; cause that &apos;s what i do
and i found something weird .
danny tucker was only ever in solitary .
so they never saw one another .
i can &apos;t tell you that for sure , but ...
well , we know danny wasn &apos;t made for jail time .
he probably talked just to keep his sanity .
sold the story of paradise to some guy stuck in darkness .
gave him all that time to fantasize about the place ,
he finally gets free and he &apos;s convinced
that finding it will solve everything .
danny !
oh , god , don &apos;t hurt him . please don &apos;t hurt him .
please , please , please don &apos;t hurt him .
please don &apos;t hurt him !
no . no !

danny ?
&quot; there &apos;s nowhere to go . &quot;
&quot; i &apos;m not ...
going back in there . &quot;
there &apos;s no other way .
i doubt anyone had ever spoken to him with any kindness .
none of us should be denied that .
&quot; a man is known by the silence he keeps . &quot;
oliver herford .
don &apos;t tell me there &apos;s another one .
there &apos;s always another one .
i told you we should have just gotten into our cars .
where are we off to now ?
home .
you need to spend at least one night in your own beds .
you don &apos;t have to tell me twice .
uh , yeah . wait for me .
thanks .
agent blake .
i owe you an explanation .
i know that you may not believe this ,
but the part of my job that i dislike the most is politics .
when you were blamed for arresting the wrong suspect
in the marathox case , i didn &apos;t stand up for you .
i let you take the fall .
no . no .
you cut my rope .
it was the highest @-@ profile case we &apos;d seen that year .
all eyes were on me .
it took a decade to recover .
but i can assure you that
your reputation in the bureau remained intact .
it sounds like you &apos;ve convinced yourself
that you didn &apos;t do any damage ,
but you did , erin .
well , that was never ... my intent .
i &apos;m sorry .
and my hope is that we can get past it .
maybe it doesn &apos;t matter to you , but i am glad that you &apos;re here .
well , that makes two of us .
good night .
you should go home and get some rest .
don &apos;t tell me you &apos;re staying here .
oh , just long enough to do the reports .
ok , good .
good night .
and you ?
you and strauss got a little history ?
in another life .
there &apos;s a story in there .
you heading out ?
in a bit .
all right . see you tomorrow .
yep .
hello .
welcome back .
you &apos;re here late .
yeah , i haven &apos;t really slept .
well , join the club .
can we start over ?
sure .
hi . my name is penelope ,
and i do not like change .
well , you &apos;re not alone .
well , i think it &apos;s worse for me than the others .
ok .
i &apos;ve always been like that . it goes back--
this is not a therapy session .
i really wanted to explain--
it &apos;s--it &apos;s fine .
honestly .
i heard you live in the district .
that can &apos;t be an easy commute .
that &apos;s really nice .
nice , huh ?
thoughtful .
i don &apos;t even know if you drink coffee ...
oh , do i drink coffee and ...
and anything else that keeps me going .
we have new teas coming in next week .
proper tea ?
as proper as it gets .
can you get my brand ?
i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t have a brand .
