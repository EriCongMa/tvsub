蜀道底部猫王八 别扭大菜
why are you up ?
how am i supposed to sleep ?
i &apos;ve been married less than 24 hours ,
and my wife isn &apos;t speaking to me .
perhaps you can think of this in a more positive light .
in one day , you &apos;ve managed to do
what it takes many couples decades to achieve .
you couldn &apos;t sleep either ?
of course not .
me neither .
but i just had a tickle in my throat .
not profound marital problems .
what are we gonna do ?
i don &apos;t know .
please , tell me how i can fix it .
glad you asked .
as i see it , there &apos;s a simple solution .
your lips had a dalliance with the lips of another woman .
it seems only logical that
to restore balance to the relationship ,
you should find another man and dally with him .
and by dally , i mean some hardcore mouth @-@ on @-@ mouth action .
okay , that is the stupidest thing i &apos;ve ever heard .
actually , i think he &apos;s onto something .
y @-@ you can &apos;t be serious .
&apos;cause i messed up and made out with a girl ,
you &apos;re gonna do the same with a random guy ?
i &apos;m currently single .
that &apos;s true . you are .
what is happening ? !
i will tell you what is happening .
i am saving my best friend &apos;s marriage .
sheldon , i don &apos;t think you understand
how being broken up works .
the only way i can sort through my feelings
is if there is space between us .
every time i see you , it re @-@ traumatizes me .
i go through the pain all over again .
well , hello to you , too .
what do you want ?
i understand we &apos;re no longer a couple ,
but i would like to remind you that we made a baby together .
what baby ?
a precocious little internet show
known as &quot; fun with flags . &quot;
i &apos;m hanging up .
great . see you in about half an hour .
sheldon , i am not doing &quot; fun with flags &quot; with you .
why not ?
because we &apos;re broken up .
sonny and cher made it work .
还共同主持过综艺节目
their variety show kept going long after the divorce ,
and here we are still talking about them .
no one &apos;s talking about sonny and cher .
you must be thinking about donny and marie ,
同在70年代主持过知名综艺节目
&apos;cause you and i are clearly talking about sonny and cher .
sheldon , this has to stop .
i know it &apos;s hard .
it &apos;s hard for me , too .
but i &apos;ve seen and talked to you more
in the two days we &apos;ve been broken up
than in the last two months that we were together .
well , if you want to see less of me ,
maybe we should go out again .
i can &apos;t believe you made out with mandy chao .
trust me , i wish it never happened .
and you knew about this this whole time ?
i did .
and you didn &apos;t think to tell me ?
leonard asked me to keep it to myself .
let &apos;s leave leonard out of this for the moment .
this is about you and me .
wait , wait , wait , how is my day @-@ old marriage falling apart
becoming about you two ?
hang on .
what do i need to do to make you trust me ?
you think it &apos;s hard having one wife ,
try having two .
i bet you told bernadette
all about he was screwing around with mandy chao .
oh , we didn &apos;t screw around .
we just got drunk and made out .
whatever . it would have been nice to hear it from you .
what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m here to return your belongings .
that &apos;s what people who &apos;ve broken up do .
and you didn &apos;t do your compulsive knocking ritual
so i would open the door .
on the contrary ,
you no longer get to enjoy my charming eccentricities .
we &apos;re not friends with benefits .
just give me the box .
w @-@ wait . don &apos;t you want to go through it
to make sure i haven &apos;t forgotten anything ?
fine .
my old scarf .
you wore it the night we went ice @-@ skating . remember ?
you mean the night that i went ice @-@ skating ,
and you stood at the rail
googling the symptoms of hypothermia ?
we made one heck of a team , huh ?
whose bra is this ?
it &apos;s not yours ?
oh , my .
how embarrassing for both of us .
it &apos;s penny &apos;s .
hey , you broke up with me .
it is none of your business
whose naked bosom i &apos;m smooshing around like pizza dough .
good @-@ bye .
amy .
amy . amy .
tables work , too . good to know .
ooh , brownies for girls &apos; night !
hands off . i &apos;m mad at you .
look , i know it &apos;s a lot of money ,
but the guy at the store said
in five to seven years , it &apos;ll pay for itself .
what will pay for itself ?
doesn &apos;t matter . what are you mad about ?
i &apos;m mad at you for blabbing to me
what leonard did on the north sea ,
and i &apos;m mad that i &apos;ve had to hide this from penny for two years .
and you have every right to be mad about those things .
so , why don &apos;t you let me
handle the credit card bill this month , huh ?
i mean , don &apos;t even look at it .
i mean , if penny finds out i &apos;ve known all this time
and haven &apos;t told her ,
she &apos;s gonna think i &apos;m a terrible friend .
i wish you never told me .
and i wish leonard never told me .
he &apos;s the bad guy here .
i guess that &apos;s true .
and you let penny marry him .
compared to that , who cares if i bought
a george clooney limited edition manscaping kit ?
hi . i &apos;m calling about your marriage counseling services
and was curious what your rate is .
really ?
um , okay .
is there any kind of discount for length of marriage ?
&apos;cause we &apos;re just talking hours here .
hi .
call you back .
can we talk ?
i would love that .
all right , look ,
i &apos;m sorry i said i was okay with everything
before we got married .
i hate that we &apos;re going through this ,
but i don &apos;t know what to do .
if you don &apos;t mind waiting for a groupon ,
we can try marriage counseling .
hello .
hey , uh , buddy ,
can we have some privacy ?
oh , of course .
wouldn &apos;t want to intrude .
this is yours .
okay , when i &apos;m done with him ,
i &apos;m gonna need more information .
nothing odd .
i just wanted to rub amy &apos;s nose in it .
okay , look , i might be overreacting ,
but how am i supposed to get past this
when i know tomorrow you &apos;re gonna go to work
and see this woman ?
forgive me for eavesdropping ,
but as i see it , there &apos;s a simple solution .
wake up , wake up , wake up .
bring penny to meet mandy .
what ? why ?
well , right now , penny &apos;s imagination is running wild ,
but if they meet , that will eliminate the mystery
and alleviate her fears .
like when that sparkletts guy let me look under his eye patch .
uh , first of all , you made that guy cry .
and we learned that you don &apos;t need an eyeball to do that .
secondly , i can &apos;t think of a more horrible idea
than penny meeting mandy .
really ? why is that ?
what , you actually want to meet her ?
no , but now that you &apos;re being weird about it ,
maybe i should .
i &apos;m not being weird .
am i being weird ?
yes .
and that &apos;s coming from me .
fine , you want to meet her ?
no , i just want to know that when you &apos;re at work ,
there &apos;s nothing going on .
how many times do i have to tell you ?
i have no interest in this woman .
yeah , well , maybe she has interest in you .
in leonard ?
oh , even the sparkletts guy could see that &apos;s unlikely .
i guess my big problem is i never saw leonard
as the kind of guy who woulde do something like this .
anybody can make a mistake in a weak moment .
what do you think ?
oh , i don &apos;t know what to think .
but then again , i just found out about it .
you know , i fell in love with leonard
because he wasn &apos;t anything like the guys
i was used to dating .
i mean , i knew those guys weren &apos;t above cheating
because that &apos;s usually how we met .
come on , you know leonard &apos;s not like that .
i want to believe you . i really do .
am i being naive ?
oh , i don &apos;t know .
this is all so new to me .
i &apos;m still processing .
you know , he never would &apos;ve done this when we first met .
he &apos;s cockier now .
that &apos;s because you made him more confident .
you know , if you think about it , without you ,
he never would &apos;ve grown into the person he is now .
i mean , sure , more women might notice him ,
but i think it &apos;s better to have a guy be with you
because he wants to be
and not because he thinks he doesn &apos;t have any other choice .
i never thought about it like that .
oh , me neither , not until just now .
hello . i &apos;m dr. sheldon cooper ,
and welcome to &quot; sheldon cooper presents : fun with flags . &quot;
you may notice that i &apos;m holding a remote control .
that &apos;s because my cameraperson and co @-@ host ,
dr. amy farrah fowler ,
has chosen to end her relationship with me .
i &apos;m going to pause here to let that sink in .
okay .
if you need to pause a little longer ,
just click the pause button .
but the show must go on .
and thankfully , all the things my girlfriend used to do
can be taken care of with my right hand .
anyway , let &apos;s not spend any more time talking about her .
we &apos;re here to talk about flags .
tonight &apos;s theme :
flags of countries that have been torn apart
and the women i have a feeling were responsible .
you guys have any idea how much it costs
to see a marriage counselor ?
$ 250 an hour . why ?
how do you know ?
bernadette and i have occasionally gone to one to ,
you know , stay on top of things .
and i &apos;m just hearing about this now ?
dude , just because we &apos;re best friends
doesn &apos;t mean that i have to tell you everything that goes on .
you don &apos;t have to , you should want to .
oh , great , there &apos;s mandy .
why are marine biologists always so cute ?
i don &apos;t know ,
but i &apos;d like to get lost in her bermuda triangle .
that &apos;s not helpful .
then i won &apos;t say
i &apos;d like to cover three @-@ quarters of her surface area .
are we done ?
not yet , this is fun .
ooh , i know .
i &apos;d let her free my willy .
where you going ?
i &apos;m gonna ask her if she &apos;d be willing to talk to penny ,
tell her she has nothing to worry about .
leonard , wait .
what ?
i &apos;d like to spongebob her squarepants .
now we are done .
oh , hi , leonard . what &apos;s up ?
uh , do you mind if i sit ?
sure .
so , um , i &apos;ve been thinking a lot
about you and me and ... the boat .
what about it ?
you know ...
what we did , when we were drunk .
oh , no , did i sleep with you , too ?
no , we just made out .
oh . well , good for me .
so what can i do for you ?
uh , okay , well , um , i got married recently .
oh , congratulations !
to sheldon ?
never gets old .
no , no , to a girl .
anyway , i told her what happened between you and me ,
and she &apos;s concerned about us seeing each other at work .
it was just a kiss . why would you even tell her ?
because i didn &apos;t want there to be any secrets between us .
is that really the reason ?
what else would it be ?
i don &apos;t know .
sounds like you &apos;re trying to sabotage the relationship .
no , i don &apos;t think so .
although , penny did say exactly that .
okay , well , that &apos;s something to think about .
you know , on some level , i &apos;ve always believed
that i don &apos;t deserve a woman like her .
oh , you &apos;re gonna think about that right here ?
i mean , she &apos;s really beautiful .
she could have any guy she wants .
which is probably why
it took her so many years to tell me she loved me .
maybe you should talk to a therapist about this .
too expensive .
you &apos;d think i &apos;d be used to women withholding their love .
i mean , my mother did .
i mean , no matter how hard i tried ,
she just didn &apos;t have any interest in me .
imagine that .
i wonder if that &apos;s why i have
such a dysfunctional relationship with sheldon .
i had a dream
the other night that i was in a cave
and i was nursing a baby ,
but the baby had sheldon &apos;s head on it .
and your wife is worried about me ?
hey , leonard !
when you &apos;re done ,
we came up with a bunch more .
then the czech republic says to slovakia ,
&quot; i don &apos;t think you understand how being broken up works ! &quot;
can you believe that ?
you &apos;d think that the czech republic
would try to hold on to what it had ,
given that it &apos;s not as young as it used to be .
and i don &apos;t see any other countries
lining up to invade its southern borders .
i &apos;m gonna kill him .
but enough about the czech republic .
let &apos;s talk about the time moldova made romania
a birthday cake
and romania said it tasted good
even though it didn &apos;t .
and yet romania gets dumped .
i &apos;ll pause here while you mull that one over .
i know , right ?
so , you said you had something to tell me .
okay , yeah , um ,
do you remember when you accused me
of trying to sabotage our wedding ?
i &apos;ve been thinking about it ,
and you might be right .
but the good news is
that i &apos;m pretty sure i know why .
i &apos;m listening .
penny , after all these years ,
i still feel like maybe i don &apos;t deserve you .
okay , that is the lamest excuse
you could &apos;ve possibly come up with .
but i get it .
you do ?
yeah .
sometimes i worry you &apos;re gonna wake up
and leave me for someone more like you .
i don &apos;t even understand
why you &apos;re with someone like me .
why would i want to be with someone like me ?
you know what i mean .
and , you know , maybe the way i &apos;ve been reacting
was me sabotaging this , too .
well , how about we stop
being so scared of losing each other
and just be together ?
that sounds nice .
good .
because ...
i &apos;ve loved you since the moment we met ,
and i will keep loving you until the end of time .
oh , my god , that is the most beautiful thing
anyone &apos;s ever said to me .
yeah ?
that &apos;s because you &apos;re beautiful ,
and your beauty fills my heart with love and song .
it &apos;s getting kind of cheesy , leonard .
if you think that &apos;s cheesy , buckle up .
penny hofstadter ,
will you please stay married to me ?
oh , damn it , you topped it .
should we go to the bedroom and make this marriage official ?
yes , please ! okay !
okay .
sheldon , i can &apos;t believe you got us a wedding gift .
i don &apos;t know why you &apos;re so surprised .
i watch movies ; i see what people do .
what is this ?
plane tickets and hotel reservations
for a weekend away in san francisco .
that &apos;s so great !
yeah , there &apos;s fisherman &apos;s wharf
and alcatraz and cable cars .
we &apos;re gonna have so much fun .
we ?
is there a problem ?
oh , no , no ! i just , i said , &quot; whee ! &quot;
how dare you go on the internet and say mean things about me
and compare my genitalia to part of czechoslovakia ? !
you saw through that one , did you ?
i don &apos;t know what you were thinking ,
but take the video down now !
she watched it .
i &apos;m gonna get that girl back .
i only watched it because you e @-@ mailed it to me
with the subject line : &quot; this is gonna make you mad &quot; !
she was listening through the door . she wants me .
