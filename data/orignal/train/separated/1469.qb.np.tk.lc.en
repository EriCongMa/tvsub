so we &apos;re going to santa barbara to pick up the bassinet .
or we can save five hours
and go around the corner to baby town .
what are you doing all day ?
jay !
it &apos;s fine , mom .
no , it &apos;s not fine . today &apos;s manny &apos;s birthday .
aw , jeez . i &apos;m sorry , kid .
don &apos;t worry . reuben &apos;s family &apos;s taking me for a birthday lunch .
you see ? even the reubens remembered .
we &apos;ll be back at 6 : 00,
and we &apos;re taking you to a special birthday dinner . okay ?
we are ?
jay !
i &apos;m sorry , kid .
i wasn &apos;t sorry . it was a setup .
we &apos;re throwing him a big surprise birthday party .
and he totally fell for it , the little jerk .
i mean , that &apos;s the whole point of a surprise party .
you take someone who you really love
and you play &apos; em like a fool .
that &apos;s not the whole point of all this .
manny has been feeling a little bit neglected ,
and i wanted to give him the most special day .
this is the last birthday
that it &apos;s only going to be the three of us .
i can &apos;t wait to see the little dope &apos;s face .
... and then that smug carol chu was all ,
&quot; you can &apos;t dig without an environment impact study . &quot;
and then i was like , &quot; bam ! &quot;
and then i slapped the study onto charlie &apos;s desk ,
and carol was like , &quot; but--but--but-- &quot;
and then i was like , &quot; chu on that ! &quot;
you said that ?
well , not with my mouth . with my eyes and my swivel .
so how was your day at work ?
oh , you know , fine .
yeah ?
i &apos;m an idiot .
i know cam &apos;s been struggling since he went back to teaching .
the students , the faculty--
none of it &apos;s clicking .
the last thing he needed
was me going on about my latest work triumph .
and then it got worse .
come on , daddy . it &apos;s time for our wedding .
what &apos;s happening ?
oh , lily and i are gettin &apos; married .
uh , what &apos;s happening ?
when she proposed , i thought it was a little weird ,
but then i read it &apos;s a phase that some girls go through .
so ...
oh , no , well , i just think it &apos;s the cutest thing ever .
here , dad . i made you this ring .
cute , cute , cute , cute , cute , cute , cute !
do you have a ring for me ?
well , lily , it wouldn &apos;t be a wedding without a ring .
yay . loving this !
daddy , move .
okay , i guess i &apos;ll just go sit on the groom &apos;s side .
oh , come on , cam . it &apos;s fun .
oh , it &apos;s fun . it &apos;s--it &apos;s super fun !
you finally got married ! hooray !
oh !

gloria says that we are surprising manny 6 : 00 tonight ,

what ? he &apos;s practically my age .
okay . uh , yeah , right , right .
and what middle @-@ aged guy would be interested
in a young , attractive , newly legal woman ?
oh , that &apos;s right ! all of them .

hermione granger ?

has she blossomed into a lovely young lady ?
yes , but--luke ,
i &apos;m never telling you anything !
oh , my god , jay ! look how beautiful !
look at this . but the bookstore is empty .
that &apos;s why china &apos;s kicking our ass .
33 !

we &apos;re so late , and we still have to pick up the drinks .
excuse me . i &apos;m terribly sorry . excuse me .
sir ? this is my cake right here .

sir , if i did for you ,
i &apos;d have to do it for everyone .
not if you just did it for me .
33 !
excuse me . excuse me .
we &apos;re in a hurry . we have a birthday party .
oh , why didn &apos;t you say something ?
we don &apos;t see many of those around here .
you think you can intimidate me with that attitude ?
what do i look like to you ?
34 !
thank you , but the point is that my son is waiting in--
gloria , it &apos;s not worth it .
we don &apos;t need these people .
jay , we need ...
come on . we &apos;ll get a better cake .
are you crazy ? how are we gonna ...
i &apos;ve got it covered . excuse me , miss ?
i &apos;m sorry i raised my voice in there ,
especially in front of the baby .
i know how delicate they can be .
oh , you &apos;re so nice to say that ,
but you know they &apos;re sturdier than you think .
in fact , every day i learn these little mir--
yeah , take care now .
hey , honey .
daddy , what &apos;s in the bag ?
oh , it &apos;s a present for manny ,
and i also got your other daddy a little something
&apos;cause he &apos;s been feeling down today .
how &apos;s your eye , sweetie ?
oh , it &apos;s fine . it &apos;s just a scratch .
let &apos;s go this way , honey .
oh , cam , are you wearing a suit to manny &apos;s birthd--
okay , let &apos;s get your hospital band off .
i like it .
okay , that can be your &quot; something blue &quot; then .
cam ?
daddy , i wanna drive my car .
a car ? oh . a car .
just a second , sweetie .
okay , does anyone know a reason why these two shouldn &apos;t be wed ?
she &apos;s my wife .
okay , so by the power vested in me by the state of candy land ...
and utah .
i now pronounce you husband and wife .
daddy , i wanna play with my car now .
okay . of course . yes , sweetie .
but remember , we have to walk down the receiving line .
oh ! what a turnout .
cam , y @-@ you got her a car ?
i can &apos;t help it that you skimped on your wedding .
okay , look , i @-@ i know what &apos;s underneath all this , all right ?
right now in your life ,
you &apos;re feeling , you know , very ...
no .
please do not turn me marrying my daughter into something ugly .
lily is having the time of her--
cam !
oh , please . do not blame me .
we always knew there was a strong possibility
she &apos;d be a terrible driver .
i know we &apos;re running late , claire .
we &apos;ll be there soon .
just start setting up .
what do you mean , &quot; surprise , surprise &quot; ?
hang on . i &apos;ve gotta go . you take care .
what &apos;s the matter ?
jay , i can &apos;t find the parking ticket .
calm down . everything &apos;s gonna be fine .
oh , good . it &apos;s a male attendant .
what does that mean ?
how would you get out of this situation if i wasn &apos;t here ?
hey , pal ,
my housekeeper forgot her ticket .
you &apos;re going to need to back up , go up to the third level ,
and find the pay station .
ay , you can &apos;t just let us go ?
i know i put it somewhere here but i cannot find it now .
pay station . third level .
maybe you can let us go now ,
and then next time i do you two times ?
the only way you &apos;re going to get out
is to go back to the pay station .
actually , there is another way .
you okay ?
let &apos;s drive through something else !
the gala celebration is only minutes away .
delectable refreshments ,
excited classmates ,
and what &apos;s this ? the most beautiful sight of all ?
go away !
he &apos;s old . she &apos;s young . it &apos;s gross .
honey , nothing &apos;s happening .
young people seek out older mentors all the time .
when i was 17,
i was really close with my friend stacy &apos;s mom .
mrs. robinson was a former cheerleader ,
so she knew just how to massage my legs after practice .
she had her own homemade bengay that didn &apos;t burn
no matter where she rubbed it on me .
if i had the chance to go over there ,
i never missed an opportunity .
i think maybe you did .
oh , i forgot the present in the car .
oh . all right . i &apos;m gonna go take a squirt while you grab it .
i know !
i love us !
it &apos;s crazy !
i &apos;m gonna fight him .
phil .
no , claire , i &apos;m gonna fight him up real nice .
how about you start with a threat ?
hey , claire , um , could you help me with this ?
yeah , yeah , yeah . yeah .
yeah , you gotta go around the other side .
i need to keep my eyes on phil .
ooh , what &apos;s happening ?
he &apos;s about to drop the hammer on haley &apos;s new boyfriend .
he &apos;s twice her age , and it &apos;s disgusting .
yeah , reminds me of
a certain manager at the cheesecake factory that you dated .
oh . todd .
he had a camaro ... and power .
ugh ! he was nasty . you just did it to get a rise out of dad .
yeah , well , look how well that worked out .
it didn &apos;t bother dad at all , and then i was stuck with a guy
who smelled like potato skins
and said &quot; supposably . &quot;
well , you have to admit , dad played that pretty brilliantly .
you know , after a few weeks ,
you got bored with him , and then you dumped him .
i did .
i dumped him up real nice .
phil .
claire . oh , come on .
phil , you can &apos;t say anything to kenny .
what ?
no .
i know why haley is doing this .
she &apos;s doing it to get back at you for being so hard on her .
i did the same thing to my dad .
first of all , i &apos;m not your dad .
and do you think i &apos;m just gonna let this happen ?
trust me . the more it bothers you ,
the longer he stays .
the more we ignore it ...
up top , dad !
yeah !
nailed it .
... the sooner willie nelson &apos;s on the road again .
i &apos;m so conflicted .
what you &apos;re saying makes sense up here ,
but it &apos;s not what i wanna do here .
and i just feel so damn comfortable down here .
i forgot to tell ya i put that in the trunk .
oh , i know . i had to reach under your jeans .
i can &apos;t believe that !
we &apos;re so crazy !
it &apos;s adorable !
wanna see outside ?
yeah .
sweetie , i brought you a cookie .
i ate at the emergency room .
you worked that in seamlessly .
oh , come on . it was-- it was an accident .
stop beating yourself up . hey , let &apos;s go mingle .
no . you know what ?
some of my students are here , and i &apos;m just--
i &apos;m not in the mood .
all right .
cam , we &apos;re gonna talk about this . i know what &apos;s going on .
you &apos;re obviously going through something at school .
you &apos;re struggling , and i have just made things worse
by bragging about what a hero i &apos;ve been at work recently .
and it--it &apos;s-- it &apos;s not a competition .
you know , my victories are your victories .
your defeats are my defeats .
hey , mr. tucker ! there he is !
* bow across a cello string *
* piano keys a hammerin *
* voices raised in harmony *
* for our dear ol &apos; cameron *
we love you , mr. tucker ! we love you ! you &apos;re the best !
bye ! bye !
yeah , it &apos;s been a nightmare .
and thank you for assuming i &apos;m terrible at my job .
no .
hey , everybody . sorry we &apos;re late .
we got caught doing a bunch of stuff .
or not doing a bunch of stuff .
okay , manny is going to be here soon ,
so let &apos;s go over the plan .
when we hear him coming , we turn off the light .
then when he comes in and turns it on ,
we all scream &quot; surprise ! &quot;
you got a pen ? i wanna write this down .
he &apos;s coming up the driveway !
he &apos;s here early ! hurry up !
hurry ! hurry !
ahh , shh , shh , shh .
quick . i don &apos;t want the neighbors to see us .
you &apos;re sure we &apos;re alone ?
yeah . they &apos;re not home till 6 : 00 .
good , &apos; cause i wanted to give you your birthday present .
actually , i &apos;d like to see your face .
it &apos;s harsh , i know .
i begged them to put in a dimmer .
no !
surprise .
manny , we &apos;re so sorry . we didn &apos;t mean to--
what ? ruin the greatest moment of my life ? !
thanks again , mom !
and the surprised becomes the surpriser .
this party had everything .
manny
manny , please come out .
unless you &apos;re here to cut a food slot on my door ,
you can leave now .
nobody &apos;s going to make fun of you .
kids make fun of you if you get a haircut .
i just gave them a full @-@ blown sex scandal .
everybody &apos;s so excited to celebrate with you .
ay , no .
the baby was ready , but i was not .
it was bad enough that manny had to share his mother .
i couldn &apos;t let him share a birthday , too .
you stay in there !
i thought you wanted me to come out .
i do ! i do ! come out !
we stole you a beautiful birthday cake .
gloria , tag out . let me give it a shot .
yes , you fix it .
look , i &apos;m not gonna sugarcoat this , kid . that was rough .
go away !
but there &apos;s an upside .
the best thing about kissing a girl
is you get to tell your friends .
the problem is , they never believe you .
but you had witnesses .
we &apos;re gonna be talking about this one for years to come , aren &apos;t we ?
you said it , kenny .
manny seems to me like a-- like a real old soul .
kenny is amazing at telling the age of a soul .
thanks , babe .
age is nothin &apos; but a state of mind , you know ?
i mean , i &apos;m probably more of a 14 @-@ year @-@ old than he is .
believe me , i know 14 @-@ year @-@ olds .
he has a 14 @-@ year @-@ old daughter .
oh , yeah .
oh , cool !
oh , honey ! you don &apos;t have to do that . they have a gardener .
trust me on this .
i want to ,
but you &apos;re just so wrong about so many things .
just keep practicing .
hey , cam , i @-@ i &apos;m so sorry that i insulted you earlier .
i thought that there was something going on at work ,
and , obviously , i was wrong .
well , you &apos;re wrong again . it is about work .
this is a fun game .
i didn &apos;t bring it up before because i was embarrassed .
but yesterday was the best day i &apos;ve had at work yet .
i clicked with the students , the teachers .
i finally felt like i belonged .
i get it .
you couldn &apos;t possibly get it . i &apos;m in the middle of my story .
i &apos;m sorry .
every day at 2 : 30 , i call lily ,
and we dunk a cookie together .
and yesterday ,
i forgot .
forgot my own daughter .
and obviously , she resents me for it .
it &apos;s why she asked you to marry her , to get back at me .
okay , here i @-@ i need to point out that she &apos;s 5
and not a character from &quot; dynasty . &quot;
and as much as i try to connect with her ,
i just keep making it worse .
maybe you &apos;re just trying too hard .
everybody , come in !
manny &apos;s coming down .
somebody pick up that towel before someone trips .
okay . i got it .
daddy !
okay ! daddy &apos;s coming ! what &apos;s wrong with me ? !
okay , everybody . so ,
we sing , then presents , then cake .
that &apos;s a colombian tradition .
and we do not speak of what happened before .
nobody saw anything .
that &apos;s another colombian tradition .
here he is , the man of the hour !
happy ...
gloria , you okay ?
no , i &apos;m fine ! i &apos;m fine .
hap--aah ! aah !
no way ! she peed !
her water broke !
so far , 14 &apos;s not my favorite age .
no , it &apos;s nothing ! keep singing ! keep singing !
ha ... ay ! stop it !
we &apos;re gonna pop on over to the hospital .
pizza &apos;s on the way .
you think about it , run a mop over this area ?
ay , manny ! i &apos;m so sorry , okay ?
and the birthday video becomes a nature film .
luke , come on .
oh my gosh ! it &apos;s happening !
manny , i am so sorry about today .
i just wanted you to have a happy birthday .
and speaking of birth-- days ...
don &apos;t listen to him .
i &apos;m not letting this baby out before midnight .
this is your day .
i &apos;m not gonna let you share it every year , okay ?
mom , look .
yeah , i &apos;ve felt a little neglected lately ,
but i &apos;ve had you to myself for 14 years .
that makes me a little sad .
oh , please . if we had actually forgotten his birthday ,
he &apos;d be out right now kissing a cute brunette .
things work out .
you know that i love you no matter what ?
you &apos;re trying to hold another person inside of you
to spare my feelings . message received .
ooh , that &apos;s a strong grip .
ah , that &apos;s a--that &apos;s a-- that &apos;s a--
ah , she &apos;s gettin &apos; close .
she &apos;s at , like , 8 beautiful centimeters .
hey . i don &apos;t think we &apos;ve met . i &apos;m kenny .
hi . i &apos;m disgusted .
mitchell , she won &apos;t even look at me .
well , she can &apos;t really look at anyone .
oh ! look who &apos;s back ...
again . what happened this time ?
he threw me in the pool .
no , that &apos;s not what happened .
it kind of is .
luke , come on . we don &apos;t need to relive it .
daddy !
oh , look at this .
i &apos;m coming ! daddy &apos;s coming ! what &apos;s wrong with me ? !
mitchell .
when she fell in the pool , she screamed for daddy .
she calls you &quot; dad . &quot; she calls me &quot; daddy . &quot;
she got scared , and she called out for me .
see ?
i guess daddy was worrying about nothing .
but , you know , i can be silly sometimes .
you &apos;re always silly .
no , you &apos;re silly .
no , you &apos;re always silly .
no , you &apos;re always silly .
oh , my god . what &apos;s wrong with me ?
the contractions are coming a little bit closer .
i think we have to call for a nurse .
no , no , jay ! no , please ! i &apos;m sorry .
for what ?
i don &apos;t know yet ,
but i know that babies make mothers crazy .
and i &apos;m going to be making mistakes ,
and the i &apos;m going to be blaming you .
please don &apos;t leave me .
you &apos;re a little emotional right now .
but it &apos;s been so long for me ,
and a hundred years for you .
are we still going to be good at this ?
it &apos;s gonna be an adventure ,
but that &apos;s what you and i do best .
look at today .
i can &apos;t ever remember having more fun with you .
i &apos;m so lucky .
now get out .
but i thought you wanted me to--
no , not you .
get out !
hey . let &apos;s go .
oh , right .
hey , guys ?
so kenny and i were thinking about going to this restaurant .
oh , sure . i don &apos;t have a problem with that . do you , phil ?
no .
in fact , it has been such a pleasure
getting to know kenny , it &apos;s our treat .
are you kidding ?
no !
give them your credit card , phil .
also , uh , this restaurant is pretty far away ,
so we might be out late .
well , sweetheart , you are only young once .
oh , might even make sense to just stay in a hotel .
okay . put it on the plastic !
great !
okay . see you tomorrow !
bye @-@ bye .
it &apos;s my ex @-@ wife--
not the good one .
what do you want ? !
nice game of chicken , claire . she &apos;s gone !
she is coming back . i am almost positive .
almost ? !
why do i listen to you ? why ?
you were wrong about the ipod being a failure .
you were wrong about tomato being a vegetable .
i don &apos;t even want to talk about your favorite &quot; planet &quot; pluto !
and unless she was lying to the good ladies of &quot; the view , &quot;
it &apos;s &quot; de @-@ mi , &quot; not &quot; dem @-@ mi &quot; !
you were going to let me go with him ? !
isn &apos;t that what you wanted , honey ?
what &apos;s the matter with you ? !
you &apos;ve been acting so weird ever since i left college !
for the record , you didn &apos;t leave college .
you were asked to leave .
oh , which you guys never let me forget , especially dad .
honey , your father--
oh , you don &apos;t have to tell me what he thinks , okay ?
i &apos;m a huge disappointment to him .
i see it on his face every day .
he acts as if he doesn &apos;t even want me around .
give me the ticket for the car .
phil--
i &apos;m going after her !
this little chicken game may work for you dad ,
but it doesn &apos;t work for me . that &apos;s my little girl .
i need her to know
that no guy on earth is good enough for her ,
let alone some slimy , middle @-@ aged jean salesman !
what &apos;s this ?
just enjoy it .
there &apos;s all kinds of milestones in life ,
the kind you expect to live through--
the first kiss .
birthdays ...
graduations .
if you &apos;re lucky , a wedding or two .
or even a new addition to the family .
then there &apos;s the kind
you never dreamed you &apos;d get to live through again .
so adorable !
so sweet !
oh , my goodness !
look at him . he &apos;s perfect !
look at him . he &apos;s so cute !
and that &apos;s the best kind of all .
why am i spoiling it for you ?
you &apos;ll see for yourself .
oh , was it difficult ?
ay , si .
it was the most painful 20 minutes of my life .
oh , well , look at that !
you &apos;re skinny again .
yeah .
yeah .
so wait . he--he &apos;s my uncle ?
no . he &apos;s your half @-@ brother @-@ in @-@ law .

half @-@ uncle or full uncle ?
what &apos;s a fuluncle ?
okay , so don &apos;t feel like you gotta stick around .
okay . we &apos;ll see you tomorrow then .
okay , we &apos;ll be back tomorrow .
bye , uncle .
