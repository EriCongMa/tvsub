did you fix the sink ?
i told you i &apos;d get to it .
your hair looks nice .
thanks .
you cut it .
hmm ?
yeah .
i know .
know what ?
i had lunch with her .
you know , we had a couple drinks --
really bonded .
what are you gonna do ?
what we always said we &apos;d do if this ever happened .
no ! no , no , no ! please ! please ! please , don &apos;t !
don &apos;t !
okay . very nice .
jennifer , play with him first . enjoy it .
ryan , you don &apos;t believe she &apos;d pull that trigger , okay ?
let &apos;s try it again . no prop gun this time .
ryan , come on , get up .
okay , you &apos;re ... great at dying ,
but you got to do it again .
ryan ?
ryan , come on .
what &apos;s going on ? what ?
&quot; cauda equina &quot; means &quot; horse tail . &quot;
cauda equina syndrome --
gets its name because all this junk
hangs out of your spine like a horse tail .
okay , could you stop playing with this ?
okay -- what the hell are you wearing ?
alfresco lunch @-@ tray pants .
they came today .
&quot; alfresco &quot; means &quot; dining in the open air . &quot;
look .
something &apos;s going on .
ups boxes .
there &apos;s your tell , maura . what happened ?
okay , let &apos;s just get back to casey .
shrapnel from an i.e.d. transected his spinal cord
and is still embedded in there .
only a cowboy surgeon would attempt to remove it .
it &apos;s hope , isn &apos;t it ?
how did you know ?
yes . she e @-@ mailed me .
she wants your kidney -- for cailin .
i haven &apos;t responded .
you don &apos;t owe her anything , okay ?
it is not your fault that she &apos;s your biological mother
just as much as it &apos;s not her fault
that you &apos;re her biological daughter .
and that didn &apos;t sound right .
you should say , &quot; i like both my kidneys . &quot;
and , &quot; have a nice life . &quot;
what are you doing out in the rain ?
oh , i couldn &apos;t get him to sleep , so i took him for a walk .
ew .
you do that in the kitchen ?
no , of course not .
yes . she was just about to put the head in the garbage disposal .
wait a minute .
you &apos;re messing with me , aren &apos;t you ?
no .
yeah . your auntie jane is a kidder .
what are you doing in the rain with my grandson ? !
babysitting .
i think when you &apos;re the father , they call it &quot; parenting . &quot;
he &apos;s fine . he likes the fresh air .
oh , come here , sweetheart . ooh .
your daddy loved to play out in the rain
when he was a little boy .
yes .
how &apos;s lydia ?
she &apos;s good .
i think she &apos;s gonna get a promotion at the penny saver .
good .
aw , no ! i wanted to go to bed early .
was it a murder ?
rizzoli .
dr. isles .
that &apos;s so cool . man , she &apos;s so lucky .
looks like an accident with a prop gun .
who pulled the trigger ?
his costar .
is that roger deluth ?
that &apos;s my councilman .
yeah , his wife was directing a community @-@ theater play here .
he got her the space because he &apos;s apparently pals
with the developer of the storrow center .
the potholes on my street are out of control .
maybe i &apos;ll just mention it to him .
or maybe we &apos;ll just go look at the body first .
i couldn &apos;t talk to the woman who pulled the trigger --
jennifer johnson , 29 .
emts are taking her to boston general .
she &apos;s being treated for shock .
yeah , i &apos;d be shock , too ,
if i fired a pretend gun and killed my costar .
who was in charge of the prop gun ?
victim .
he was the star , lighting designer , and prop master .
well , it &apos;s community theater -- they &apos;re all volunteers .
that &apos;s odd .
look at these entrance wounds .
&quot; wounds &quot; plural ? that &apos;s bizarre .
it kind of looks like a cheese grater .
maybe he forgot to clean the prop gun ...
or left cotton wadding in it ?
it hardly seems enough to kill him , though .
i need to dissect this heart to know what caused this injury .
did you check the other blanks ?
i was about to . that &apos;s his prop cart over there .
his real job was maintaining this building
and the rest of storrow center .
i &apos;m having his truck towed to the evidence garage .
anybody else have access to the tool box ?
i &apos;ll check .
yeah .
it looks like a tragic accident , but i &apos;d rather be sure .
i wish it was still raining .
the sound is so peaceful .
what are you doing ?
nothing .
then why do i hear the sound of computer keys clicking ?
you &apos;re accessing dmv records ?
ohh , he has a special license .
didn &apos;t you just hear me ? you shouldn &apos;t be doing this .
this is an abuse of power .
well , that &apos;s why i &apos;m using your computer .
i &apos;m not abusing my power -- you are .
well , since i &apos;m the one who &apos;s exposed ,
you &apos;re gonna go knock on his door
and talk him out of the ridiculous surgery
that he &apos;s about to have .
i have left messages , i &apos;ve e @-@ mailed ,
and he doesn &apos;t respond .
so , you know ... maybe it &apos;s not meant to be .
well , that &apos;s odd .
what ?
what are those , b.b.s ?
larger ... denser -- possibly ball bearings .
either way , mr . fix @-@ it
wouldn &apos;t load steel balls into his prop gun ,
unless he was committing suicide .
i &apos;m not seeing any signs of tampering
on any of these other blanks .
mm , me , either .
so , he either killed himself
or someone filled a cartridge with ball bearings
and then loaded it into ryan &apos;s prop gun .
the director of the play said he kept the gun in his tool box .
where &apos;d he keep his tool box ?
apparently , all over the place .
storrow center has three separate buildings .
anybody could have had access to it .
irregularities of no specific form .
what ?
seven are perfect spheres .
three have anomalies .
okay , why is that significant ?
well , the clearance between part and gauge
is critical to function .
&quot; significant &quot; means &quot; worth mentioning . &quot;
well , if a ball bearing is out @-@ of @-@ round ,
it can cause binding or excessive wear .
it &apos;s frost . he has something .
oh , hallelujah .
bye , maura .
well , if they &apos;re not uniform ,
they won &apos;t reduce rotational friction
and support radial and axial loads .
jennifer and ryan weren &apos;t just costars in a play .
oh , they were costars in real life .
maybe that &apos;s why she was hospitalized for shock .
yeah , or she needed to disappear in a hurry
before we could start asking her questions .
check out this text ryan sent to her yesterday morning .
&quot; i &apos;m on a mission to get over you . &quot;
what happened ?
from what i read ,
it looks like she broke up with him ,
and he ... didn &apos;t take it very well .
&quot; no point in being alive without u . &quot;
you think he committed suicide by girlfriend ?
maybe . or she killed him .
what &apos;s the motive -- he &apos;s a crybaby ?
or a real ass ... if he let her think she killed him .
yeah , we need to talk to her .
i didn &apos;t want to do the scene with the gun . i told him that .
were you angry with ryan ?
yes !
what were you thinking when you pulled the trigger ?
well , i was in character ,
so i was thinking about how much ryan pisses me off .
did ryan show you how to load a prop gun ?
but i couldn &apos;t do it with my fingers .
i fell and broke two knuckles .
jennifer , we think it &apos;s possible
that ryan was committing suicide ...
and he used you to do it .
no . no way .
why -- why would he kill himself ?
no , it was an accident .
we were getting married .
he , uh ... he gave me this last night .
but i @-@ i couldn &apos;t get it on my finger .
why did you break up with him , then ?
&apos;cause he was always complaining about his job .
the maintenance job at the storrow center ?
yeah .
he said that there was too much to do
and that he was barely breaking even
with all the supplies and stuff .
i just got tired of listening to him complain .
i mean , i told him to quit .
he said he had to figure something out first .
figure what out ?
he never said .
it &apos;s nice that lydia is breast feeding him .
it &apos;s so much healthier .
plus , it &apos;s obvious why he likes it so much .
what does that mean ?
if i &apos;m gonna feed it to him , i got to try it , right ?
excuse me one minute .
hope , how are you ?
i hope i &apos;m not catching you at a bad time .
no , no .
i was just taking a quick break
to visit with my son and grandson .
it &apos;s nice to see you .
i &apos;m glad you two are seeing each other again .
so , maura told you ?
told me what ?
well , i have been ... e @-@ mailing her ,
but she hasn &apos;t responded .
have a seat .
well , she didn &apos;t tell me much ,
but i know you didn &apos;t leave on good terms .
i was , uh , so shocked .
and i -- i didn &apos;t react well ,
i &apos;ve never in my life been as surprised ...
as i was when a grown woman told me that she ...
is the baby that i thought died at birth .
how &apos;s , uh ... how &apos;s cailin doing ?
she &apos;s doing very well .
i know this isn &apos;t my business ,
although , uh , maura -- maura is my business .
did you come here to ask her to --
yes .
i came to see if she is still willing
to donate one of her kidneys to cailin .
hey , tommy , honey ?
come here . bring me t.j.
oh , yeah .
he really is a beautiful baby .
you know , i would do anything for any one of my children
and for this baby .
so , no one --
no one can blame you for wanting to save cailin .
can you scan for depression ?
are you depressed ?
only when you ask me that -- no , i meant him .
i don &apos;t understand why he would kill himself that way , you know ?
i mean , something &apos;s hinky here .
i think you should talk to him .
he &apos;s dead , maura .
i meant casey .
i &apos;m scared .
of what ?
more rejection .
he &apos;s only rejecting you out of fear .
and if you don &apos;t try
to talk him out of a surgery that could kill him ,
you &apos;ll regret it .
well , now i &apos;m really scared .
what is this ?
why does he have concrete in his tool box ?
i am so glad that you said &quot; concrete &quot; and not &quot; cement . &quot;
too many people think it &apos;s the same thing ,
when cement is actually a component of concrete .
no , but why is he saving it ?
and why is he saving a broken fluorescent light bulb ,
a copper pipe , and a bent anchor bolt ?
well , maybe he needs to purchase more .
yeah , but it looked like he was hiding it .
&quot; &apos; creep &apos; ? epoxy . recycled ? &quot;
that &apos;s a strange list .
oh . so , he xeroxed some plans .
he was in charge of maintenance for all three buildings .
it makes sense that he had building plans .
what do you think that means ?
oh , my god . oh , my god !
it &apos;s your mother .
oh , my god .
and my mother -- my biological mother , hope .
she &apos;s in the cafe . what is she doing here ?
she came to get your kidney ?
stop .
can you please go talk to her ?
what ? !
i -- why do i have -- she &apos;s your ... relative .
oh , no . she rejected me .
she said that i wasn &apos;t her daughter .
but then she remembered she needed your kidney
for her real daughter , cailin !
i don &apos;t want to talk to her .
but i -- i can &apos;t keep ignoring her . it &apos;s rude .
so ... call her and tell her to make an appointment .
good idea .
but w--
no ? all right .
dr. martin . didn &apos;t you get my message ?
i &apos;m ... very busy today .
yes , i did .
but i would really like to talk to you .
what do you want to talk about ?
when we met ... i said that i felt a strange kinship with you .
you also , uh , said that conceiving me
was the biggest mistake of your life .
i &apos;m sorry that i said that .
maura , i had no idea .
paddy told me that our baby died .
and i visited the grave .
you &apos;re really trying to tell me
that you &apos;ve never seen any of this ?
paddy doyle &apos;s capture was international news .
i closed the door on that part of my life .
well ... at least your 18 @-@ year @-@ old had the guts to confront me .
you just denied your life .
the harvard girl who got seduced
by the -- the evil thug .
and then you ran .
i &apos;m ... very sorry .
i had this ...
this stupid little @-@ girl fantasy ...
that when we met , you &apos;d be ...
everything that you are .
but you &apos;d want me .
you &apos;d be very happy to know that i was alive .
i reacted badly .
&quot; badly &quot; ?
you accused me of lying .
you told me that i wasn &apos;t your daughter .
i actually think that you asked me what i wanted from you .
yes , i did .
and now you &apos;re back .
do you see paddy doyle when you look at me ?
do you see evil ?
no .
and i saw so much good in your father .
paddy doyle &apos;s not my father .
i loved him .
and he was the -- still is --
the most complicated ...
intelligent , damaged human being that i &apos;ve ever met .
why are you here ?
cailin .
well ...
i know what i should do --
give you my kidney to save your daughter .
but i &apos;m your daughter , too .
i know that i have no right to ask you .
you don &apos;t .
i think you should go .
hello . i &apos;m looking for lieutenant colonel casey jones .
he &apos;s not ?
do you have any idea when he &apos;ll be back ?
okay . thanks very much .
guess what we found .
what ? no ! i was gonna say that .
found this in the victim &apos;s glove box .
that &apos;s weird .
i found this in the victim &apos;s tool box .
we matched that chunk of concrete
with this nasty dent in the hood of ryan &apos;s pickup truck .
ryan filed an insurance claim three days ago .
&quot; a loose chunk of concrete
&quot; dropped from the ceiling of the garage at work
and caused this damage . &quot;
frost , can you pull up articles
on the construction of the storrow center ?
sure .
okay , so we &apos;ve got concrete that &apos;s fallen on ryan &apos;s truck ,
concrete debris that he hid in his tool box ...
xeroxed plans for the storrow center --
what &apos;s that say to you ?
well , his girlfriend said he was complaining
about all the maintenance work he had to do .
which makes no sense .
the storrow center &apos;s basically brand @-@ new .
tenants only started moving in eight months ago .
and in other news ,
after three years of legal wrangling ,
developer sam nelson won approval to build
the billion @-@ dollar storrow center .
i &apos;m finally seeing my dream realized --
three towers with combined office , retail ,
and living space next to the charles river .
the storrow center is my gift to boston .
his &quot; gift . &quot;
did he mention the billion dollars he &apos;s also pocketing ?
says here he already has
four more contracts for city buildings ,
plus a mall and an office park .
you think maybe ryan was the mosquito buzzing around him ,
complaining about chunks of concrete and busted lights ?
maybe .
although ...
look at this post @-@ it i found .
my father used to complain all the time about creep .
the ones your were dating ?
that &apos;s funny .
no .
ryan saved anchor bolts with dried epoxy .
he wrote &quot; epoxy &quot; on this post @-@ it .
okay , creep can happen over time .
the concrete cracks , the anchor bolts pull out ,
and the pipes burst .
my father hated being blamed when the pipes burst from creep .
maybe ryan was finding problems
with the storrow center buildings .
sam nelson would want to cover that up .
what , enough to kill one of his employees ?
maybe .
billions of dollars at stake for one maintenance guy ?
what ? where you going ?
the storrow center . it &apos;s not far .
we don &apos;t have enough to say hi to this guy .
and you know sam nelson has a stadium full of lawyers .
yeah , we show our cards now , we &apos;ll never get him .
can you guys relax ?
i &apos;m just gonna snoop around in the public areas .
with your cellphone ?
with the camera in my cellphone .
jane , can you give tommy and the baby a ride home ?
why can &apos;t you ?
i &apos;m filling out paperwork .
i don &apos;t have anything to do .
i can drop them after i take the photos .
really ? you &apos;re sure ?
yeah . no problem .
all right . thanks .
good , &apos; cause maura needs a shoulder to cry on .
why ? what happened ?
girl stuff .
maura , what are you doing ?
looking for the oblivion of sleep .
what about him ?
he doesn &apos;t mind .
okay . come on .
you &apos;re gonna get lip gloss on your nice pillow .
i don &apos;t care .
i thought you told her to make an appointment .
she just showed up .
well , at least you got to keep your kidney .
no , no , no . it wasn &apos;t even about that .
i wasn &apos;t holding my kidney hostage .
okay , this conversation just took a weird turn .
i can &apos;t believe i just did that .
wha-- did what ?
i stopped being nice . i said what i thought .
i was really mad and hurt , and i just ... said it .
maura , that &apos;s good .
that &apos;s okay , all right ? i &apos;m proud of you .
i feel nauseous . what did i say ? why did i say it ?
why -- i don &apos;t even know what i said .
okay , okay . let &apos;s talk about something else .
ooh ! ball bearings .
you like to talk about ball bearings .
well , i &apos;m almost certain
that they came from a computer hard drive ,
and the lab is trying to track down the manufacturer .
okay . good .
speaking of balls , i strapped mine on
and called casey &apos;s office .
you did ?
he took a leave of absence yesterday .
well , go talk to him now -- like right now .
it &apos;s my lunch hour , and i only have 43 minutes left .
well , that &apos;s enough time to say what needs to be said .
i don &apos;t know what needs to be said .
say &quot; enough with the magical thinking that could kill you
or leave you a quadriplegic . &quot;
ohh , i don &apos;t know why i &apos;m doing this !
&apos;cause you love him .
there &apos;s nowhere to park .
you &apos;re a cop . you can park anywhere .
yeah . yeah , why not ? i &apos;ll only be a minute .
okay .
oh . all right , t.j.
jane , what are -- what are you doing here ?
can i talk to you ?
it &apos;s not a good time .
well , there &apos;s not gonna be a better one .
it &apos;s not too pretty , is it ?
i didn &apos;t mean to come here unannounced .
i &apos;m not here to embarrass you , okay ?
i have tea , uh , water .
can &apos;t drink alcohol .
because of the surgery .
right .
so you &apos;re going through with it ?
yeah . i am .
maura seems to think that ... your spinal injury
is in a place that &apos;s hard to repair .
yeah .
yeah , it is .
and -- and that whatever surgical procedure you &apos;re having
is risky .
it is -- very .
well , how risky ? like , &quot; you &apos;re gonna die &quot; risky ?
more likely , i &apos;ll end up a full paraplegic .
oh , my god .
i told you it wasn &apos;t romantic .
well , then , why do it ? okay , why make things worse ?
this catheter .
i was about to put it in when y--
look , i &apos;m -- i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m not saying it doesn &apos;t suck , okay ? it does .
all right ? but it &apos;s reality .
and i can deal with reality just as long as you talk to me .
okay ?
reality ? i can &apos;t feel , jane .
i can &apos;t --
not just here .
i cannot feel anymore .
i can &apos;t make love to you .
i can deal with crutches and the leg braces ,
and ... i can even deal with the catheters .
i can &apos;t live without being able to feel you .
give you children .
are you hungry ? you want some of this ?
hey ! what the hell do you think you &apos;re doing ?
who said you could take pictures here ?
easy , mr. nelson . boston police .
do you have a warrant ?
otherwise , i want you off my property -- now .
this part of storrow center is open to the public , sir .
all right . i &apos;m gonna call my attorney .
damn .
all right , when i get back , i want you gone !
oh , my god . what the hell ?
t.j. !
okay . i guess i should go .
it &apos;s fr-- i &apos;m so sorry .
frankie , again .
answer it .
i @-@ it could be an emergency .
yes -- what ? - jane ?
jane , there &apos;s been a huge collapse at the storrow center .
you &apos;ve got to get down here .
calm down , fr-- what ?
it &apos;s really -- listen to me !
that &apos;s where tommy and frost were , okay ?
oh , my -- okay . - just get down here , jane !
n-- i &apos;ll be right there . i &apos;ll be right there !
get down here ! now !
what is it ?
uh ... my brother and my baby nephew and my partner --
t @-@ there &apos;s been a building collapse in the back bay ,
and they think they &apos;re trapped inside .
let me come with you .
n @-@ no . i @-@ i can &apos;t wait for you .
follow critical response protocol .
everybody understand ?
nothing we can do about the people trapped
in the subterranean parking areas right now .
we evacuate everybody else first .
captain green !
detective rizzoli --
my brother and his baby and my partner
are trapped in the underground parking level p @-@ 3 .
i &apos;m sorry , detective .
that building is way too unstable
to even think about that right now .
no , but we have to go --
i &apos;ve got three more with internal injuries .
okay , transport the head injury .
maura !
maura ! !
what is it ?
they &apos;re inside the building -- frost and tommy and t.j.
oh , my god . are you sure ?
jane ! jane .
i couldn &apos;t find them .
we were pulling out bodies a @-@ and people with broken bones .
we got to as many of them as we could
before they ordered us out .
they &apos;re afraid that the entire building is gonna collapse .
it &apos;s built from recycled concrete .
what ?
the lab results came back
on the concrete samples that you found .
it &apos;s recycled -- ground @-@ up concrete debris ,
not the more durable concrete made from hard rock .
ryan &apos;s list .
&quot; recycled . &quot; he knew .
w @-@ what other shortcuts did this builder take ?
they can &apos;t find him .
sam nelson , the developer --
he was last seen leaving right before the collapse .
he &apos;s probably halfway to the marshall islands by now .
okay , look , you don &apos;t say a word to ma , okay ,
until we &apos;re sure they &apos;re in there .
dr. isles ? we &apos;ve got more coming .
maura , go . go .
come on . we &apos;re going in there .
they won &apos;t let anyone past them . i tried .
okay , so we try again . come on .
jane . jane , wait . you can &apos;t .
you can &apos;t .
i hope they &apos;re still alive in there .
i know . i know . i know .
ohh , t.j. !
t.j. ! daddy &apos;s right here !
daddy &apos;s right here ! it &apos;s gonna be okay !
it &apos;s gonna be okay , t.j.
you hang in there , buddy , okay ?
d @-@ detective frost !
i &apos;m here . i &apos;m here .
my head is killing me .
i can &apos;t get my arm out .
help over here !
local 4 operating engineers are sending in more heavy equipment .
well , tell them to get a move on .
okay .
and i &apos;ll reach out to , uh , building collapse units
in connecticut and new york .
councilman deluth , captain green , we need to talk to you .
we &apos;re doing all we can , detective .
it &apos;s bad concrete .
what ?
the builder -- he used recycled concrete .
that &apos;s what caused the collapse .
no , that wouldn &apos;t be enough
to cause such a catastrophic failure .
i @-@ i spoke with the structural engineers who built it .
they think that it was a combination of the heavy rains
and the additional stories
that the developer added to building 3 .
so , maybe vibrations from the heavy equipment
and the additional pilings compromised building 1 ?
yes .
we want to go in .
our brother and our nephew are trapped inside there .
i don &apos;t want a marble rolling around in there right now .
it &apos;s not a question of if that building is coming down .
it &apos;s a question when .
i promise you ,
if we can get enough equipment in there and shore it up ,
i &apos;ll go in there myself .
captain green !
initial gcs of 5 .
point tenderness at the left parietal .
internal bleeding . he needs to get to beth israel .
i &apos;m out of transport right now .
get a police car and get him out of here .
hey , you got a car ?
dr. isles . what can i do ?
fema put out a call to all off @-@ duty nurses and doctors ,
so i just came as soon as i heard .
thank you .
can you assess the patients over there ?
i think that woman has a fractured femur .
hello , ma &apos;am . i understand you &apos;re in pain .
which leg is it , please ?
this one ? all right .
that &apos;s all right . it &apos;ll be okay .
nothing so far ? okay , just keep looking .
i &apos;m sorry , jane . frost is better at this .
you &apos;re doing fine , okay ?
just get to the p @-@ 3 camera at about ... maybe like 1 : 15 or so .
okay . almost there .
jane , i got something .
that doesn &apos;t mean they &apos;re alive .
it means they &apos;re in there .
i can &apos;t risk other lives .
there &apos;s a 3 @-@ month @-@ old baby in there .
we can &apos;t just stand here !
i &apos;m letting you stay out of courtesy , detective ,
but if you try to go into that garage ,
i will put you on the other side of that barricade !
code on , evac -- move it !
don &apos;t give up .
i &apos;m not . i &apos;m not .
okay .
i don &apos;t know how to scan these plans .
can you see that ?
yeah , sort of .
all right . he circled a section on p @-@ 3 .
okay .
this looks like an arrow .
he &apos;s got a rectangle labeled &quot; p @-@ 3 floor &quot;
and then a circle with a question mark inside .
no , but maybe there &apos;s something under p @-@ 3 .
p @-@ 3 is the lowest level .
jane ! jane .
the lab was able to trace the ball bearings used to kill ryan
back to 500 recalled computers .
okay . okay . i &apos;m talking to korsak .
no , listen to me .
most of those computers were purchased for city employees ,
including all 13 city counselors .
korsak , find out the name of the concrete company
that supplied the concrete to sam nelson .
give me a sec . give me a sec . give me a sec .
koneff concrete .
looking for the owner .
claire koneff deluth .
the wife of the councilman ?
oh , god .
they put the concrete company in her name
to avoid conflict of interest .
thanks .
here you go .
we really appreciate everything you guys are doing .
you know , this is a hard thing --
