okay .
whoever said that you feel great after a workout
never went for a run in the middle of a heat wave .
well , when perspiration evaporates from the skin ,
it extracts the heat by vaporization
in order to change into a gaseous state ,
resulting in a cooling effect .
so i need to run faster and sweat more to cool off ?
guys , that &apos;s dangerous .
here , here , here . give me that .
we were just trying to cool off .
all right , well , you come over here
or that water &apos;s gonna knock you on your swimsuit .
there you go .
thanks , ma &apos;am .
what ? &quot; ma &apos;am &quot; ? really ?
they &apos;re so cute .
you &apos;re still going to be a mother someday ,
and you &apos;re going to be a great one .
thanks .
hi , angela .
hi .
hey , ma . what are you doing here ?
well , maura told me you guys were going out for a run ,
so i went and i got some sweat tea .
those guys over at herbland recommended it .
it helps keep you cool .
ma , this tea is steaming hot .
and it smells disgusting .
it &apos;s the peppers .
uh , well , the cultures of some of the hottest places on earth
consume hot and spicy food because it makes you sweat .
rizzoli .
isles .
okay , yeah , we &apos;ll be right there .
got to go .
but try it . it &apos;ll keep you cool .
yeah , so will sitting in front of an open beer fridge ,
and you don &apos;t have to vomit first .
maybe next time .
ugh , my a.c. sucks .
i was so hot last night , i didn &apos;t get any sleep .
you have central air @-@ conditioning , right ?
uh , yes , but i don &apos;t use it .
why , you trying to make me feel bad ?
because i sleep in the nude .
note to self -- no follow @-@ up questions .
well , it helps to lower body temperature ,
which stimulates your cortisol .
i can regulate my own cortisol , thank you .
what do we got ?
male , no apparent lacerations , signs of neglect .
i &apos;m guessing shih tzu .
maybe a hint of poodle .
i found this little guy
wandering around with signs of heat stroke .
couldn &apos;t just leave him .
he &apos;s very cute . what about the victim ?
our victim &apos;s richard nelson .
male , 28 years old , up on the third floor .
what &apos;s wrong with you ?
third floor , jane .
so ?
the power &apos;s out .
uh , too many people running their a.c.s overnight .
no elevator . i &apos;ve been running up and down for an hour .
well , why don &apos;t you wait out here .
take a little break .
maybe the dog &apos;s owners will show up .
you see how that dog is panting to cool down ?
works for humans , too .
since when did south boston get a hipster arts district ?
its realtors rebranded this neighborhood &quot; sobo . &quot;
don &apos;t say that . that is not a thing .
oh , it is a thing , jane .
i get invited to sobo art galleries all the time .
there &apos;s the landlord .
i &apos;ll meet you guys inside .
i &apos;m telling you i can &apos;t do anything till the police take a look .
they &apos;re here now . i &apos;ll call you back later .
sorry .
what can you tell us about the victim ?
he was , um , a good tenant .
quiet , and always paid his rent a week early .
what did he do for a living ?
he was a bartender .
a bartender can afford a place in this neighborhood ?
oh , his apartment was rent controlled .
but he &apos;s been here a long time , about 8 years b.s.
&quot; b.s. &quot; ?
before sobo .
all right , uh , how did you find him ?
i came up about 10 : 30 this morning
when a neighbor from downstairs --
she complained about water leaking from the ceiling .
okay , thanks .
you bet .
what caused the leak ?
follow me .
that &apos;s a lot for one guy .
did the neighbors hear anything ?
nothing .
okay , it is ridiculously hot .
i &apos;m opening a window .
shit .
painted shut ?
no , there are water spots in the dust .
it looks like something was dragged over the windowsill .
if we open the window , we might destroy evidence .
oh , the curse of competence .
hey , um , can you guys get a sample of this ?
yeah , sure .
thanks . there &apos;s a fiber right there .
body &apos;s in there .
heat waves and dead bodies do not mix .
mm . time of death ?
it &apos;s hard to tell .
the upper body is badly decomposed
due to the extreme heat ,
and the lower extremities are well @-@ preserved .
so he &apos;s half @-@ baked .
well , that &apos;s weird .
what ?
well , core body temperature for the lower extremities
is 65 degrees .
it was 90 degrees last night .
did the landlord say that he turned the running water off ?
no , he told me he bolted when he saw the body .
maybe he was in a big tub of ice .
after a bottle of whisky ,
it might have seemed like a good idea .
well , alcohol acts as a vasodilator .
it makes the person feel warm
while their body temperature &apos;s actually dropping .
so if he was drunk , he might not have realized
he was getting so cold .
hypothermia ?
it &apos;s possible .
freezing to death in the middle of a heat wave .
just when i thought we &apos;d seen everything .
this is the coolest -- place in the building .
well , the autopsy room is on a separate system .
can &apos;t let the bodies deteriorate from the heat .
why do you have an audience ?
oh , well , they just wanted to observe an autopsy .
orozco from media relations
and anders from the carriage unit ?
oh , hi , detective rizzoli .
welcome . you &apos;re just in time to hear the autopsy report .
they are using you for your cool air .
i know , but i &apos;ll take any opportunity
to get people interested in science .
now , initially , i wasn &apos;t able to see due to the bloating .
but once i made the &quot; y &quot; incision ,
i was able to determine that the victim had a crushed larynx .
poor guy .
please hold your questions and comments till the end .
thank you , susie . so the cause of death was --
strangulation ?
that is right . it is strangulation .
yay , science .
also , uh , the lab results came back
on the fibers from the windowsill ,
and they were from a heavy @-@ duty composite rope .
and what about the tox results ?
the blood @-@ alcohol level was a 0.19 .
so he was drunk enough that he &apos;d be easy to strangle .
and then once he was dead , he was put on ice .
that &apos;s what it looks like .
by why would someone use ice ?
to obscure time of death ?
slow down decomposition ? hide the smell ?
maybe allow for more time to escape ?
you &apos;re being somewhat non @-@ committal .
it &apos;s hot . i wouldn &apos;t poke the bear .
metaphorically speaking .
thank you , maura jr .
well , now we &apos;re going to practice
weighing internal organs .
and let &apos;s start with the liver .
yeah , i &apos;m cool enough .
i &apos;m sorry , dr. isles .
one step at a time , susie .
one step at a time .
it would have taken over 100 pounds of ice
for that tub to overflow .
that &apos;s a hell of an ice delivery .
well , the dust on the windowsill was recently disturbed ,
and we found rope fibers ,
so he must have pulled it up through the window .
okay , you know what i &apos;ve realized ?
that this is just hot air moving faster .
what do we know about the victim ?
oh , he was arrested once in college
for disorderly conduct .
other than that , pretty unremarkable .
landlord said he had a girlfriend
with bright red hair , freckles , but she didn &apos;t come by much .
well , maybe this is just one of those rare occasions , you know ?
they &apos;re having drinks , they get in a lover &apos;s quarrel ,
and she strangles him .
she &apos;d have to be a big girl
to be strong enough to haul him into the tub .
well , we won &apos;t know until we find her .
okay . i &apos;m going to get an ice coffee .
you said hell would freeze over
before you drank ice coffee .
too hot .
i &apos;m done dog @-@ sitting .
hey , why did you lock up little sipowicz ?
i thought you weren &apos;t gonna name it .
well , i got to call it something before i find his people .
sipowicz , come .
call it whatever you want . it &apos;s not gonna listen .
he &apos;ll listen to me . sipowicz , come .
sit .
heel . sipowicz .
good luck , dog whisperer .
man , it &apos;s hot in here .
you want to take our laptops and go work in the autopsy room ?
hanging out with dead bodies is not really my thing ,
so i vote for solving the crime and going home .
what is it ?
this guy had a lot of money squirreled away --
a dozen brokerage accounts ,
ranging from $ 40,000 to $ 300,000 .
you sure ?
he only had like $ 600 in his checking account .
he &apos;s a millionaire .
i &apos;m not sure i can add properly with my brain on fire ,
but i think that &apos;s right .
so we have a giant pile of money for motive .
now we just got to figure out who knew he had it .
sipowicz , come .
treat . treat .
wait , wait !
sipowicz , ven aquí .
muy bien .
muy bien .
muy bien . habló einstein espanol solo .
vámonos .
vámonos .
it turns out the broker &apos;s name
was the same on all the accounts --
alex ruebens , fisk financials .
i @-@ i called his office .
his assistant said he was in the neighborhood
and would meet us here .
well , did she ask why we wanted to see him ?
i @-@ i told her richard was dead ,
probably been killed for his large fortune ,
and we had no leads and could really use alex &apos;s help .
seriously ? !
no ! i told her nothing .
this heat is making you crazy .
i bet a fancy investment firm has air @-@ conditioning .
alex ruebens ?
i &apos;m alex ruebens .
i &apos;m detective jane rizzoli .
i &apos;m just gonna grab a coffee . you want one ?
no , thank you .
landlord said the girlfriend had red hair .
did he suffer ?
we don &apos;t know .
when was the last time you saw him ?
two days ago . we had lunch together .
how long were you dating ?
almost five years . we met at a funeral .
no ... that sounds horrible .
i was at a funeral ,
and he was bringing flowers to his grandmother &apos;s grave .
miss ruebens , why don &apos;t you sit down ?
any idea who killed him ?
no .
rich was very private .
but i assumed that was the artist in him .
he was an artist ?
a novelist .
he worked at the bar to support his writing .
seems like the money you were managing for him
would support him .
where did it come from ?
he found it .
he found it ?
yes .
jogging -- he -- he showed me an article about
a drug @-@ related shooting in the same park .
why didn &apos;t he turn it in to the police ?
i @-@ i checked with an attorney .
you don &apos;t have to turn in found money .
okay , so why work as a bartender if he was a millionaire ?
he didn &apos;t want to spend the money
until he had finished writing his book .
i figured he was done because he asked me to set up
monthly transfers into a new checking account .
okay , well , there was no will ,
and there &apos;s no family to notify ,
so where &apos;s the money go now ?
a trust .
who are the trustees ?
i am .
where were you last night ?
at work .
look , he deposited the money in installments ,
and i have the last one at my house .
i will bring it in . i don &apos;t want his money .
there was a drug @-@ related shooting in stony brook park
around the time rich said he found the money .
i just talked to my guy in the drug unit .
it was an undercover buy gone bad .
there was cash involved , but only 20 grand .
so he saw the article in the newspaper ,
then used it as a cover story for his girlfriend .
that is a big lie .
probably means the money is of a more dubious origin .
you think the girlfriend &apos;s involved ?
i don &apos;t think she &apos;s strong enough
to pull ice up through a window ,
much less haul him into a bathtub .
sounds like a &quot; maybe . &quot;
it &apos;s a definite &quot; maybe . &quot;
hey , did you find anything ?
you know the great american novel he was writing ?
&quot; i was facing a financial crisis of my own .
&quot; but for me , there would no bailout .
&quot; the game is rigged ,
and i was determined to fix the odds in my favor . &quot;
continue .
that &apos;s it . it &apos;s less great than short .
if you ask me , it &apos;s the perfect length for a novel .
wait a minute , okay , so he &apos;s lying about the novel .
he &apos;s lying about the money .
where did this money come from ?
well , the best lies are usually half @-@ truths .
so maybe he was a drug dealer .
hipster drug dealer laying low in sobo .
isn &apos;t that the bubble drink ?
no , that &apos;s soba .
no , no , no , the noodles are soba . bubble drinks are boba .
sobo is what the hipsters are calling south boston .
it &apos;s not a thing .
never mind .
if he wasn &apos;t bartending to fund his creative dream ,
maybe that is how he was making his money .
drugs -- it &apos;s the american way .
good morning , angela .
are you waiting for jane ?
no , no , i &apos;m waiting for korsak and sipowicz .
i &apos;m on dog @-@ sitting duty .
well , that sweat tea really seems to be working for you .
you just seem completely energized .
i am . two cups this morning .
and i &apos;m seeing colors i @-@ i &apos;ve not seen before .
really ?
you know , you didn &apos;t get to taste it the other day ,
so i brought you another one .
oh , how thoughtful . thank you .
hey , angela , thank you very much for watching sipowicz .
oh ! i just fed him , and he &apos;s already been walked .
oh , great , no problem . i &apos;ll take good care of him .
sipowicz , ven aqu . sientate .
i love that you speak spanish , vince .
say something else .
muchas gracias , senorita .
ven aqu . ven aqu , perrito .
and that tie , uh , really , uh ,
brings out the color in your eyes .
what are you talking about ?
this tie is brown . my eyes are green .
well , then you just look good for no reason , vince .
come on , sipowicz .
we &apos;re sorry about your friend .
i can &apos;t believe he &apos;s gone .
he would have sold five copies of his novel
to every customer at the bar .
so you were close ?
rich changed my life .
i used to tell stories all the time ,
and rich got me into writing .
man helped me finish my first memoir , &quot; unbouncable . &quot;
sounds like a great guy .
he was .
anybody feel differently ?
what do you mean ?
you know , someone who would want to hurt him ?
i mean , if you asked me that question about a week ago ,
i &apos;d probably have said no .
but then the other night ,
this guy walks in and tried to cut the line ,
and i tried to stop him .
and he said rich could vouch for him .
but when rich saw him ,
he got real nervous and told me not to let him in .
the guy was pissed .
you get a good look at the guy ?
sure .
we &apos;ll need you to sit with our sketch artist .
okay .
do you know anything about rich selling drugs at the bar ?
no way , man . rich ?
rich is one of the most law @-@ abiding people i ever met .
just the idea of double parking a car
made him break into a sweat .
he have a reason to be so nervous ?
that &apos;s just the way he was .
maybe his nervousness was his artistic fuel .
or maybe your friend was running on empty .
hey , todd . you change from the vampire shift ?
no , susie asked me to come help with the overcrowding issues .
love of science catching on ?
this is the hottest ticket in town .
and the coolest place in the building .
we &apos;re a sweaty bunch . well , not you .
you &apos;re not sweaty . you &apos;re clammy .
uh , moist .
glistening ?
open the door , todd .
okay . sorry .
do those come with a free daiquiri ?
you &apos;re so you sometimes .
do you have something ?
this is the cash
that the broker girlfriend gave us .
did you know that all united states currency
is printed on a cotton @-@ linen blend paper made by crane &amp; co . ,
which they &apos;ve been
supplying since 1879 ?
yes . you know what else is a fun fact ?
something that helps me catch the killer .
okay .
the entire stack had consecutive serial numbers
printed in fort worth , texas , in 2008 .
also , gc @-@ ms scan showed no signs of drug residue ,
which is very strange , given that 90 % of u.s. bills
have cocaine imbedded in their fibers .
so no drug residue ,
and they all were printed in 2008 .
it &apos;s like they came out of printing
and never went into circulation .
most likely .
i also found traces
of dried flowers , mold , and arsenic .
the money was poisoned ?
well , arsenic has many uses --
a wood preservative , insecticide .
before 1910 , it was used as an embalming fluid .
and most recently --
embalming fluid .
uh , the kind you find in old graves .
not a grave ...
but close .
thanks , maura .
so , rich &apos;s girlfriend said they met here .
he was bringing flowers to his grandmother .
he lied about that , too ?
no , the -- the grandmother &apos;s here .
and so is the great @-@ grandmother .
and so is her sister , who died in 1906 .
you working on their family tree ?
i don &apos;t think the door &apos;s supposed to be open , is it ?
the lock &apos;s busted . someone broke in .
clear ...
which seems odd to say in the middle of a mausoleum .
maybe it wasn &apos;t a break in .
maybe it was a break out .
what , our killer &apos;s a zombie ?
could be fun .
probably we wouldn &apos;t have to mirandize him or anything .
there &apos;s something in there .
looks like rich was using granny for an atm .
which , sadly , puts a stake in your zombie theory .
yeah , that &apos;s him .
came around every friday , like clockwork .
it &apos;s so nice when the youth visit with such frequency .
such a shame .
did he visit this past friday ?
yeah , he was here .
did rich have any reason to break the lock ?
no , he had my phone number .
if he &apos;d lost his key , he would have just called .
i noticed the lock was missing
when i made my rounds sunday afternoon .
i called and left rich a voice message , but --
he never called you back .
no .
thank you for your time .
the lock was broken before our victim was killed .
somebody &apos;s looking for that money ,
and rich is dead because they didn &apos;t find it .
csru get a print off the lock ?
barely a partial .
i don &apos;t know what i want more -- to find our killer ,
or for the air @-@ conditioning to come back on .
what did you find at the graveyard ?
a broken lock and a duffel bag
with a couple old hundreds in it .
so that &apos;s where he was keeping his money all this time ?
the real question is where did all that money come from ?
i ran the serials from the cash his girlfriend brought in ,
and it wasn &apos;t reported stolen
or mentioned in any police report .
nothing .
well , nobody gets handed $ 2.9 million for no reason .
it &apos;s grown to $ 2.9 million .
the deposits started in 2009 .
he also opened more accounts as time went on .
how much did he start with ?
let &apos;s see .
in 2009 , the interest was ...
making $ 550 per week as a bartender .
well , he opened the fifth account in 2010 .
subtract monthly expenses and rent .
rich was living off his income as a bartender ,
but he wouldn &apos;t have been able to save anything .
which means he would have started out with
exactly $ 2 million .
nice , round number .
can &apos;t you just get a sign
that says &quot; autopsy employees only &quot; ?
we tried that , but it kept disappearing .
where &apos;s todd ?
oh , when dr. isles said you were coming down ,
he said he needed to freshen up .
no .
make it snappy , maura . todd went to go freshen up .
i don &apos;t know how long that takes ,
and i don &apos;t want to find out .
okay .
our spectrophotometer shorted out because of the heat ,
and we just got it back online ,
so i finally finished my analysis
of the water from the bathtub .
this is tap water from the building .
it &apos;s consistent with what you &apos;d get from the quabbin reservoir ,
which , as you know , provides water to all of boston .
yep , so delicious .
it also has all the compounds
that you &apos;d expect to find in it --
barium , sodium , cryptosporidium , etcetera .
and this is the water that the victim was found in .
did you find any other dna in it ,
or is just filled with more &quot; -iums &quot; ?
no to both , but what is interesting
is actually what is missing from the water .
it &apos;s too hot to guess , maura .
it lacks sodium .
it &apos;s been desalinated .
yes , and desalinated water
is used in agricultural irrigation , on ocean vessels ,
and the manufacture of pharmaceuticals ,
semi @-@ conductors , hard @-@ disk drives .
so our killer could be a computer engineer ,
a sailor , a farmer , a -- what was the last one ?
semi @-@ truck ?
semi @-@ conductor .
i can &apos;t ! it &apos;s too hot to think !
maybe you should just go home and rest .
i can &apos;t ! it &apos;s too hot there , too .
wait . your a.c. works , right ?
uh , well , yes , it works .
maybe i could stay at your place .
oh , well , i mean , it works ,
but i don &apos;t actually turn it on because i sleep --
i know , yes .
would you just please turn it on tonight ?
i suppose .
thank you .
i &apos;ll bring you some pj &apos;s .
and if todd comes back ,
tell him that i &apos;m staying at your house tonight .
i drove to work today
in a helmet , leather jacket , and boots .
ah , there &apos;s some pretty sweet convertibles on autotrader.com.
convertible ?
do i need to remind you how impractical
a convertible would be in boston eight months of the year ?
it &apos;s not like my motorcycle &apos;s any more practical .
i can &apos;t believe there &apos;s still no a.c ..
if i wanted to work in these conditions , i &apos;d be a baker .
no , you wouldn &apos;t .
no , i wouldn &apos;t .
is it still cool in your world ?
yes , and crowded .
i can barely start a rokitansky
without 50 sweaty people watching over me .
well , they &apos;re so much better up close .
you think so ?
maybe , if i knew what a rokifransky was .
oh , come on . get off of me .
korsak , would you get this dog off of me ?
that dog seems to be exhibiting displacement behavior .
it &apos;s called &quot; humping , &quot; dr. isles .
you have to speak to him in spanish .
oh , really ? want me to pant , too ?
hey , come on , shoo .
i am serious .
that is a spanish @-@ speaking dog .
sientate .
muy bien .
adiós .
anyway , i checked with the feds ,
but they didn &apos;t know anything helpful .
richard didn &apos;t have any experience
that would put him near that kind of cash .
and he worked at a bookstore out of college , got laid off .
then he moved to the mailroom at chen industries .
chen industries ?
chen industries ?
yeah . what did i miss ?
well , the c.e.o. &apos; s son was kidnapped about six years ago ,
but i never learned the details .
all i know is that the dad paid the ransom
and the kid was returned .
so are you saying
that our murder &apos;s connected this kidnapping ?
i &apos;d bet $ 2 million it .
dr. isles ?
it &apos;s ... can you believe this heat ?
it is so hot .
missed the ice @-@ cream truck out there .
eric chen , son of billionaire harold chen ,
c.e.o. of financial giant chen industries , was kidnapped .
official report says b.p.d. got a call
from the boy &apos;s mother reporting the kidnapping .
now , five days later , the family put out a press release
that eric had been returned .
was there any investigation ?
detectives kept trying .
but after the initial phone call ,
the family refused to cooperate .
guy &apos;s a billionaire who runs a fortune 500 company .
paying a big ransom is the fastest way to get his son back
eric chen also worked at chen industries .
rich could have been watching him for months .
rich was the inside man , and he had an accomplice .
they might have had an agreement .
rich would keep the money in his family &apos;s mausoleum for six years
while they waited out the statue of limitations .
it was a smart plan . they made it .
what went wrong ?
it wasn &apos;t up .
the statute runs out in three days .
that &apos;s when it will be six years from when eric was returned .
so our killer wanted to make an early withdrawal ,
and our victim didn &apos;t want to go along .
no one ever talked to eric chen about it .
maybe he can lead us to rich &apos;s murderer .
where &apos;s the kid ?
not finding him .
no dmv or bank accounts . he &apos;s off the grid .
well , we &apos;ll start with harold chen .
i &apos;ll bet he &apos;ll be more willing to talk to us
if he knows we found his money .
where does someone get $ 2 million in cash ?
is there some special teller window for that ?
you thinking of withdrawing the rizzoli family fortune ?
in order to get $ 2 million , one must have $ 2 million .
harold chen ?
boston police .
we -- we &apos;d like to talk to you about your son &apos;s kidnapping .
i &apos;m late for a meeting .
it &apos;ll only take a second .
it was a long time ago .
i &apos;ve got my son back . he &apos;s safe now .
our family &apos;s been through enough .
we have reason to believe
that we may have found the ransom you paid .
i &apos;m meeting with a company that &apos;s going to invest
hundreds of millions of dollars with us .
if i &apos;m late , i lose a lot more than $ 2 million .
well , that went well .
well , at least he confirmed the $ 2 million was the ransom .
they started at chen industries at the same time .
same age with zero experience .
chen started as an executive ,
and nelson started in the mail room .
nepotism sucks .
i &apos;m right here , jane .
i don &apos;t mean you .
yes !
what is that ?
it &apos;s a victory cha @-@ cha . i found sipowicz &apos;s people .
finally .
congratulations , korsak .
excuse me .
you were with mr. chen earlier today .
yes . i &apos;m his daughter .
well , i work for him , too .
what can we do for you ?
i &apos;d like to know if there &apos;s any new information
on who kidnapped my brother ?
well , um , a recent case has been linked to the incident .
getting any information about the kidnapping
would help us a lot .
can you tell us anything ?
uh , no .
eric didn &apos;t want to talk about it when we got him back ,
and we didn &apos;t push him .
well , we &apos;d certainly like to hear his version of the story .
do you think you &apos;ll catch the kidnappers ?
that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to do .
can you tell us where he is ?
健康中心
how long has eric been here ?
oh , he checked himself in about 5.1 / 2 years ago .
i just assumed it was because he felt
like the kidnappers couldn &apos;t get him here .
66 % of people with mental health issues never seek help ,
so the fact that your brother checked himself in
means that , deep down , he really wants to get past this .
hey , thanks for coming .
you &apos;re welcome .
hey , eric , it &apos;s lucy .
eric ?
eric !
oh , sorry .
there &apos;s some people here that -- they want to talk to you .
hi , eric .
i &apos;m detective jane rizzoli . this is dr. maura isles .
i &apos;m busy right now .
okay .
have you ever been to the top of mount wachusett ?
that &apos;s what that is , right ?
yes .
have you been ?
once , a long time ago .
before ...
well , i &apos;ve never smelled air so fresh .
yeah .
and the view ?
eric , um ...
we -- we found one of your kidnappers .
he &apos;s dead .
he was probably killed by an accomplice .
if you &apos;ll talk to us ,
we think that we can find that person , too .
i @-@ i don &apos;t know .
eric .
you were denied the opportunity
for us to catch your kidnappers before .
let us do that for you now .
talk to us , eric .
maybe we can make you feel safe again .
what can you remember from right before you were kidnapped ?
on friday nights ,
a bunch of people would go out drinking after work .
the high @-@ level executives loved buying me drinks .
it was fun .
before i knew it , i was really drunk --
drunker than i &apos;d ever been .
you may have been drugged .
i wanted to get out of there before i embarrassed myself .
i vaguely remember going outside
and asking someone to get me a cab .
it &apos;s cloudy from there .
how many of them were there ?
there were two men .
i thought of them as the nice one and the jumpy one .
do you remember any conversations they had ,
anything else about them ?
i remember waking up blindfolded and tied to the chair .
at some point , i talked to my dad .
they made me tell him i was alive .
do you remember any distinctive sounds ,
like a highway or bells , music .
i heard horns .
okay . uh , car horns ?
no .
it sounded bigger than that .
like a foghorn ?
maybe .
okay . that &apos;s good .
can you remember anything else about where you were ?
was it hot ? was it cold ?
it smelled .
i remember it smelled awful sometimes .
can you describe the smell ?
it was like sewage .
that &apos;s all i remember . i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s okay . you did great , okay ?
okay .
of all the people rich called the year of the kidnapping ,
a handful had records .
one of them , billy skolnick ,
was a roommate of his in college .
matches the sketch the bouncer friend gave us .
he &apos;s got assault and battery charges , drunk and disorderly .
he &apos;s also bought three boats in the last five years .
they &apos;ve all been repossessed .
guy really wants a boat .
he was expelled from college for stealing a.v. equipment ,
then started working as a commercial fisherman .
eric didn &apos;t see where he was being held ,
but he may have heard a foghorn ,
and he said it smelled like sewage .
the smell of low tide . probably up near the wharves .
uh , we have a partial print from the mausoleum lock .
i &apos;ll try to backwards match it
to the print from billy &apos;s record .
fishing boats have equipment
for desalinating sea water for long trips .
they use that water to make ice for packing fish .
or for packing dead bodies . where is he now ?
he works on a boat
that docks next to the east boston fish market .
so he must have showed up ready to get his money
and then got upset when rich told him he invested it .
when he broke into the mausoleum and saw it wasn &apos;t there ,
he just assumed his partner ripped him off .
fingerprint matches .
let &apos;s go get him .
no boat for billy .
excuse me . looking for billy skolnick .
over there .
freeze ! boston police !
move , move , move !
billy skolnick ,
you are under arrest for the kidnapping of eric chen
and the murder of richard nelson .
you have the right to remain silent .
anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law .
you have the right to an attorney .
so the surviving kidnapper
will be in jail for the rest of his life .
you checked yourself in here ,
and you can check yourself out .
there are fantastic outpatient facilities
for you when you &apos;re ready .
okay .
eric ?
cold beer and cold wine .
yes , and yes .
so , jane , i ran some lab tests
on that sweat tea that angela &apos;s been pushing .
and you realized it &apos;s disgusting .
good job , doctor .
well , i noticed that after drinking it
both angela and sipowicz were exhibiting ...
unusual signs of arousal .
ew , no , don &apos;t .
just -- just get to the point .
well , the main ingredient is ají charapita ,
which is consumed primarily in a jungle in peru ,
and it is a potent aphrodisiac .
hey , girls .
up here .
yeah . so , you look great , ma .
what , a mom can &apos;t look nice ?
angela , i have to tell you something about that tea .
i know you girls don &apos;t like it .
yes .
no .
well , i never tasted it ,
but i have tested it in my lab ,
and it &apos;s chemically enhancing you .
in a bad way ?
yes .
it &apos;s an aphrodisiac .
well , how long will it take to wear off ?
i would say about two days .
you ready to go , angela ?
yeah , well ...
... might as well make it count .
shall we ?
maura .
what is it ?
caliente .
i &apos;m good .
no .
try some .
don &apos;t touch it .
