the doctor said the stroke did no permanent damage ,
so if you just keep taking ...
so , where am i going ?
the luncheon , remember ?
yes , where am i going afterwards ?
oh , home-- i set up a room for you upstairs .
your house ?
yeah .
won &apos;t alicia have a problem with that ?
i don &apos;t think so .
mr. gold .
oh . eli ?
hold on . one second , mom .
how &apos;s she doing ?
well , she &apos;s getting him to commit to a timeline .
good , uh , anything more on that campaign worker--
what &apos;s her name ?
indira starr .
i have the investigator on the other line ,
double @-@ checking the dates .
oh , good . who &apos;s the investigator ?
kalinda .
should i not ?
uh , no , no , no , it &apos;s fine .
so , how are we doing on the straw poll ?
uh , you &apos;ll win it . it &apos;s just a question of
whether the press think you &apos;ve won it by enough .
okay , well , keep me in the loop .
well , let &apos;s get you to that luncheon .
peter , what &apos;s going on ?
nothing &apos;s the matter , mom .
it &apos;s obviously something .
it &apos;s just a story
we want to keep from being written , that &apos;s all .
somebody ... is lying about me .
about you and some campaign worker ?
yeah .
and alicia &apos;s hurting you ?
no-- what are you talking about ? no .
i don &apos;t believe you .
mother , alicia has been great .
she &apos;s with the press right now ,
trying to keep the story from being printed .
and this happened when ?
you seem to answer questions with questions , mrs. florrick .
yes , only to help clarify .
to the best of her recollection ,
she said it happened on august 21 , 2012 .
indira starr says she was
in my apartment august 21 , 2012 ?
yes .
sleeping with your husband .
and she said that i found her hiding in my bathroom
and that i told her peter and i had an open marriage ?
yes .
well , peter and i were separated then ,
so that &apos;s impossible .
another lie .
at a certain point , the story just crumbles , mandy .
indira starr says she slept with peter on september 30
at the st. martin hotel and afterward ,
she heard him call you to discuss picking up the kids .
is that not true ?
what time was that exactly ?
so eli can double check her story ?
no .
so , i can refresh my memory .
you really are a lawyer .
yes , and i am late for court .
she said she heard the call at 11 : 30 p.m. approximately .
no . to the best of my memory ,
peter and i didn &apos;t talk that night .
well , thank you for your time , mrs. florrick .
it &apos;s much appreciated .
you &apos;re welcome .
hope you kill the story .
i don &apos;t like being lied about .
no one does .
i could kiss you .
well , that would give them something to write about .
hey , you got a pen ?
yeah , eli , i have a pen .
she claims peter made a call
at 11 : 30 , immediately after sex .
at the st. martin hotel ?
mm @-@ hmm . 15th floor .
indira starr was in room 803
and then she went up to peter &apos;s .
you might check .
i think i was in the adjoining room that night .
the 15th ... with the door open .
this is tre lawson .
tre was a 19 @-@ year @-@ old college freshman , living his dream :
attending chicago polytech
on a water polo scholarship .
until one day , he was hazed to death by ...
this man . his teammate , wayne crockett .
he is the one who taunted tre ,
bullied him and eventually drowned him .
wayne crockett plead guilty to the drowning .
he is serving eight years in prison .
and yet , ms. lockhart isn &apos;t satisfied .
she is suing ...
the university
where this heinous crime took place--
chicago polytech .
they are the ones who let the bullying
at this yearly water polo party get out of hand .
and as much as my learned colleague mr. andrews
would like to make this case about mr. crockett ,
it is actually about the university ...
turning a blind eye to a vicious student ritual
that cost mr. and mrs. lawson their son .
and what is this , coach shank ?
the dunk .
and &quot; the dunk &quot; is a yearly party the water polo team
has the night before its first match ?
yeah , um , but it &apos;s not approved by the school or me .
but , you &apos;ve been to one before ?
uh , yeah , a few years ago ,
but when i saw what was happening , i left .
so , could you describe what is happening here ?
it &apos;s the first year players , they &apos;re ...
being held under by the veteran players .
i see .
for as long as they can hold their breath ?
yeah , but again , the school doesn &apos;t approve .
he &apos;s drowning !
get him out , get him out of the pool !
in fact , didn &apos;t you tell the team
not to do the dunk this year ?
yes , i did ; i thought it was wrong .
but the team did it anyway and they took it off campus .
yeah , at one of the houses of one of the team members .
so , how could anyone possibly conclude
this was sanctioned by the university ?
they knew about it .
it &apos;s been an institution at this school for 50 years .
and did the university have a &quot; wink @-@ wink &quot; attitude towards ...
objection , your honor .
i will sustain that .
now , coach shank stated that he told the team
not to have the dunk this year , is that true ?
yeah , but they say that every year .
and you received a text
from coach shank the night of the dunk ?
yes , i did .
could you read the text ?
&quot; don &apos;t get too drunk at the dunk .
have match tomorrow . &quot;
so , coach shank knew about the dunk going forward ?
oh , yeah .
thank you , mr. sultan .
he offered 500,000 .
i told him we &apos;re not budging from six million , right ?
yes , this has been hard , hearing him say we &apos;re greedy .
the more they call you names ,
the more you know you &apos;re winning .
oh , would you excuse me a second ?
you almost done ?
yup , in another ten minutes ,
we &apos;ll no longer occupy the 27th floor .
how &apos;d it look ?
sad .
we &apos;ll get it back , will .
i know .
you retreat to advance .
it just feels like we &apos;ve been
retreating for four years now .
we &apos;re still standing .
every other firm that started out when we did , they &apos;re gone .
i know . but , if you ever want to be motivated ,
just come on down to the 27th .
it &apos;s a kick in the ass .
thank you so much for having me .
i imagine you &apos;ll forgive a mother
for singing the praises of her son .
he &apos;s handsome .
now , i know that might not be the best reason
to vote for a governor ,
but there will always be some women who will come forward
saying my son flirted with them or @-@ or @-@ or touched them ...
... but i want you to know peter has always struggled
with women coming after him .
even in grade school .
hey , eli .
you know , just checking in .
having a good time here at the alliance for retired americans .
with , uh , your girl jackie
and would you like to know what she just said ?
well , i told peter you just have to beat them off with a stick .
stop her !
how would you suggest i do that ?
use a 2x4 if you have to .
and peter is an absolute gentleman ,
women think he &apos;s being nice and , uh ,
try to take advantage of him-- yes ?
eli would like to talk to you .
i &apos;m supposed to tackle you if you say no .
hello , eli .
jackie , i need you to excuse yourself from the speech
and let mr. moody drive you over here .
i &apos;m in the middle of my remarks .
jackie !
you &apos;re gonna apologize to the room
and tell them that your stroke has left you weak
and then you &apos;re gonna get ...
just a few more questions , mr. sultan .
you were the best friend of the killer , wayne crockett ?
well , i don &apos;t know about &quot; best &quot;
but you were friends ?
he texted you ?
yes .
and could you read this text he wrote you there ?
it &apos;s right there , that one .
&quot; is mary bringing the brews ? &quot;
this was referring to the party , the dunk ?
yeah .
and who &apos;s mary ?
mary ?
it &apos;s no one .
mary is no one .
uh , well , uh , here &apos;s an easier question :
who brought the brews that night ?
tre .
ah , tre lawson , the victim .
so , was mr. crockett referring to tre as a &quot; mary &quot; ?
your honor , objection .
i &apos;m not quite sure what mr. andrews finds relevant here .
yes , i &apos;m intrigued ,
mr. andrews , but confused .
&quot; mary &quot; is a derogatory term for someone who &apos;s gay , your honor .
objection !
objection !
okay , okay , okay , thank you .
mr. andrews ?
we would agree the plaintiff
has proved the university was aware of the dunk ,
but it is my contention
that the university could not have controlled the killer
because this was a hate crime .
your honor , it has no bearing ...
no , that is completely irrelevant ...
wait a minute , wait a minute .
mr. andrews , are you saying
the university isn &apos;t liable if mr. crockett killed tre
because he was gay ?
yes . if the murder was not an inevitable consequence of the dunk ...
if @-@ if it was not inevitable , then the university
could not have foreseen the murder .
the killer was never charged with a hate crime .
yes , but that should not impede mr. andrews &apos; theory of the case .
you say the university is liable
because it knew about the hazing and didn &apos;t stop it .
he &apos;s saying the murder went beyond the hazing
because it was a hate crime ,
and , therefore , the university isn &apos;t liable .
well , i &apos;ll let both theories contend
and let the jury decide .
so , come back tomorrow ,
ready to argue whether this is a hate crime or not .
our son isn &apos;t gay .
good . anything you can do to help us .
it &apos;s a lie
and he &apos;s gonna keep on lying as long as we hold out .
no , sir , he is lying to make you settle .
you told us this was going to be an easy ...
what i told you , sir , is that the defense will try anything
in its power to shake your confidence in this case .
can you promise me you can win this still ?
no .
i can promise you that we will work even harder now
because i am angry ...
and this should make you angry , too .
okay .
okay , if he &apos;s not gay , let &apos;s prove it .
get kalinda on it .
i &apos;ll review the case law on hate crimes ,
then we &apos;ll talk again in two hours .
it &apos;s not about comfort ; we &apos;re the named partners .
yes , and i &apos;m the creditors &apos; trustee .
i can veto your decisions .
not on this . not on office space .
i &apos;m not saying i can on office space .
i am saying i have more clout
and i &apos;m willing to take a smaller office .
which is your choice .
and what is the topic under discussion ?
he wants to put a wall in here ; right there .
and you and i will share the space .
we lost the 27th floor .
we have to double up ,
and some litigators are without offices .
that will undercut morale ,
so it &apos;s incumbent upon leadership to sacrifice .
true .
but we &apos;re not gonna do it .
we &apos;re bringing this firm back ,
and we &apos;re doing it in the offices we have now .
and unless you want to go to the bankruptcy judge on this ,
mr. hayden , i suggest you back off !
at some point , you &apos;ll realize
i &apos;m trying to save you from yourself .
what got into you ?
wheaties .
mr. gold , i was only trying to help you .
don &apos;t .
i am trying to kill an article
about peter sleeping with a campaign worker ,
and every time you talk about women chasing him ,
you make that the story .
don &apos;t bark at me , mr. gold .
oh , jackie , that wasn &apos;t barking .
this is barking !
when you &apos;ve calmed down ,
we can discuss my schedule .
your schedule &apos;s changed , jackie .
you &apos;re in double @-@ a ball now .
i have no idea what that means .
that means that , until you behave ,
you &apos;ll be speaking at the regional senior center
of greater morton grove .
i &apos;ve never heard of that .
exactly .
miss hayward .
mr. gold . you seem busy .
yes , we &apos;re preparing for a straw poll this weekend .
it means everything and nothing .
why everything ?
well , the straw poll votes don &apos;t actually count for anything ,
but if we don &apos;t get them , the press will say we &apos;re ...
you know what ? it doesn &apos;t matter .
anyway , what can i do for you ?
hey ! out .
i &apos;m hearing rumors
that trouble me , as a donor .
well , if they trouble you , they trouble me .
what are they ?
that there &apos;s another shoe about to drop .
you understand , eli , i agreed to contribute--
that was dependent on peter keeping his pants zipped .
where are you hearing this ?
the women &apos;s leadership forum .
i was encouraging other donors to give ,
and there was some , uh ...
reluctance .
well , peter has done nothing untoward .
but his political enemies will still lie about him .
i have to go .
have i assuaged your concerns ?
i &apos;m not sure .
cary , thank you for stepping in .
very good job on the copyright suit .
uh , thank you , sir .
no court time , and they settled for $ 80,000 .
well , if the firm can avoid court , we win .
i feel you &apos;ve been without an office for much too long , cary .
you &apos;ve been here ...
uh , two months .
and everyone speaks highly of you .
so i &apos;d like to move you into an office by the end of the day .
thank you .
and i want you to come to me when you need to .
when i ... ?
if there &apos;s anything you think can be ...
improved ... please feel free to contact me .
you mean ... like ... anything ?
like , the lunchroom or ...
people , cases , management decisions ...
anything .
i &apos;d hate to limit your scope .
beth alexander , and i ...
what was the second question ?
your address .
oh . sorry .
i &apos;m nervous .
on campus . van de beek dorms .
thank you , beth .
and you were a classmate and friend - of the victim tre ? - yeah .
in fact , you were more than that , weren &apos;t you ?
what do you mean ?
you dated .
objection , your honor .
relevance-- one can be gay and still date women .
then let the defense make
that argument in closing , your honor .
this is not the time ...
excuse me ...
hold on , now , both of you !
sit down , ms. lockhart .
mr. andrews is correct .
you are not the questioning attorney .
mrs. florrick , do you have the same argument
against mr. andrews &apos; objection ?
yes , your honor .
then , mr. andrews , i overrule your objection .
let &apos;s not argue our case through objections . please .
made me break my paperweight .
mrs. florrick , you may continue .
thank you .
now , beth , um , i hate to be blunt ...
but did you have sex with tre ?
yeah .
on many occasions ?
yeah , on many .
and to your knowledge , did he ever sleep with men ?
no ! tre was from a religious family . he never ...
sorry , mr. and mrs. lawson .
he never slept with men .
good .
thank you , beth . no further questions .
did you hear the rumor on campus that tre was gay ?
objection , your honor . hearsay .
ms. lockhart , again ?
objection , your honor . hearsay .
no , ms. florrick .
and by extension , ms. lockhart .
the question is whether she heard the rumor .
that &apos;s all .
she can answer yes or no .
did i hear the rumor he was gay ?
yeah .
because he had a lisp ?
well , i don &apos;t know why .
it was probably just the way he was .
you mean ... effeminate ?
yeah , i guess .
so , anyone not knowing
you were dating tre might think he was gay .
objection !
that is irrelevant ...
that is exactly my point , your honor .
defense is just pushing ...
but that &apos;s my point , your honor .
hate crime is not about whether the victim as gay or not ,
it is whether the killer thought he was gay .
your honor , this lawsuit has gone far afield .
yes , ms. lockhart .
but the point is well @-@ taken .
the reality of the victim &apos;s sexual orientation is immaterial .
i might seem gay to someone ,
until they found out i had a wife .
so , unless you have evidence
as to the mental state of the killer , i will allow .
you get to kalinda , ask her to talk to the killer in prison .
he has reason to help us .
got it .
i need your help .
oh , and why should today be any different ?
this is the new eli .
the thankful eli .
so thank you .
now i need something else .
mrs. florrick .
a quick matter ?
i know you &apos;re having drinks with maddie tonight .
you do ?
i make it my business to know .
that is a scary thought .
she &apos;s heard the rumors about peter
and she needs to know it &apos;s a lie .
so tell her .
no , she needs to hear it from his wife .
she knows i lie for a living .
if you tell her , she &apos;ll believe you .
this is a friendly drink , eli .
i &apos;m not going to turn this into a political thing .
then don &apos;t . tell her as a friend .
okay , here &apos;s what i &apos;m gonna do :
if she brings it up , i will confirm that it is a lie ,
but i &apos;m not going to bring it up out of the blue .
alicia , please .
she will not bring it up .
take what you can get , eli .
what do you think of cary agos ?
what do i think ? i think he &apos;s great .
you like him ?
yes . very much .
i &apos;m the one who suggested the firm hire him .
good . that &apos;s all .
is there anyone else you &apos;d like to talk about , mr. hayden ?
no , just cary .
here we go , cary .
your new office .
my office-- this is alicia &apos;s office .
it was alicia &apos;s office .
now it &apos;s both of yours .
hello , alicia .
hello .
hi , cary .
alicia .
so , this should work out fine .
thank you for understanding .
welcome .
i @-@ i didn &apos;t ask for this .
i know . really . welcome , eli .
cary .
i &apos;m ... losing my mind .
it probably isn &apos;t for me .
alicia florrick .
oh , yes , kalinda .
we need to get to the killer , wayne crockett ,
find out whether he knew the victim was gay .
he &apos;s at tamms .
cary agos .
yeah .
oh , yeah , good .
when can you meet ?
we &apos;re not going at him too late .
no , we &apos;ll make him see he &apos;s bitten off more than he can chew .
he doesn &apos;t want a hate crime charge
any more than we do .
look , i &apos;m gonna try ...
what ?
i was just saying i had to get a key .
oh . thanks .
where are you , kalinda ? what case ?
nothing , it &apos;s just something old .
look , i @-@ i can &apos;t speak now .
i &apos;ll speak to you later . bye .
would you like to see the room ?
yes , please .
look , were you here on september 30 ?
i was .
it looks like i checked them in .
oh , good . great .
oh , this woman-- do you recognize her ?
no . who is it ?
indira starr .
she said she spent the night in the 15th floor suite .
are you sure you don &apos;t recognize her ?
i am sure , but ...
i don &apos;t check in everyone .
shall we ?
mr. gold was staying in the room next to mr. florrick ,
but the door between them was open ,
and i just wanted to see if he had
an unobstructed view of the bedroom .
uh , actually ...
the connecting door wasn &apos;t open .
it wasn &apos;t ?
what do you mean ?
i mean our staff has to open the door connecting the rooms ,
and there was no request .
can &apos;t the occupants open it on their own ?
no , i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;ve disappointed you .
no , um , it &apos;s just not what i expected .
still want to see the room ?
yeah , sure .
what did you just do ?
well , the 15th floor is the concierge floor .
the guests are given a keycard to access it .
and someone on a lower floor isn &apos;t given such a card ?
concierge card ? no .
they have to pay for it .
why ?
well , the campaign worker , indira starr ,
who was on the eighth floor ,
she said she went up to the 15th floor .
is that possible ?
if she was given a concierge key ,
yes .
i seem to have pleased you now .
you sure have , ms. ledger .
pedro almodvar .
pedro ... manovedar .
pedro am ... am ...
you &apos;re drunk .
no , i don &apos;t ...
i &apos;ve never said that name before .
did we order these ?
no .
they just bring them .
they give rich people free things .
they just give ...
yes .
they do .
um , apartment rooms , food , free computers ...
apartment rooms ?
oh , wait , no . hotel rooms , i meant .
free hotel rooms , cars , even .
it &apos;s really very wrong .
poor people have to pay for everything ,
and i am given stuff i could buy a hundred of .
oh , no , no , no , no .
i won &apos;t make it home .
well , my driver can take you .
why do you want to be my friend ?
what ?
why do you want this , why are we here ?
i don &apos;t know , do you not want to be here ?
i just ... i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m not very interesting .
oh , my god .
i &apos;m ...
what ?
what ?
you were gonna say something . what ?
no , no . i , um ... i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m ... i &apos;m just an idiot .
oh , no , now you just have to say it .
thank you for giving , um , to peter &apos;s campaign .
you &apos;re welcome .
was that it ?
i was questioned by a reporter
about peter having an affair with a campaign worker .
and there were lots of questions about me , too .
things like ... how i supposedly
approved of the affair .
so i just ...
i wanted you to know what i &apos;m going through .
i &apos;m sorry .
that must be hard .
it is .
is there anything i can do ?
no , no , no . no . no .
i think , um , we &apos;ve convinced the magazine
that the story &apos;s false .
good .
did eli tell you to say that ?
did ... what do you mean ?
well , i expressed my concerns to him .
did he ask you to speak to me ?
yes .
but i wanted to tell you anyway .
i @-@ i did .
okay .
guard says you &apos;re with the lawsons .
they &apos;re the reason i &apos;m in here .
why am i gonna help them ?
so you don &apos;t spend another 20 years in prison on a hate crime .
maybe they haven &apos;t told you .
i &apos;ve already been convicted .
they can &apos;t charge me again .
no . maybe they haven &apos;t told you .
hate crime is a federal charge .
they can charge you again .
look , the school is saying that you killed tre
because he was gay .
is that true ?
no . tre wasn &apos;t gay .
good . and you &apos;ll swear to that in court ?
no , i &apos;m not getting on a witness stand .
why not ?
my lawyers don &apos;t want me to .
there &apos;s more that can go wrong than right .
then help us .
who can we speak to ?
chad minson .
i &apos;m a friend of wayne crockett &apos;s .
and what happened on the night
of august 26 , 2011 , chad ?
wayne and i were in my room , playing call of duty .
we left about 3 : 00 in the morning to go to a diner .
and did you have occasion to see tre lawson at that time ?
yes .
he was coming out of beth alexander &apos;s room .
they were kissing .
and both you and mr. crockett saw this ?
objection as to what mr. crockett saw .
uh , mr. minson , how do you know what mr. crockett saw ?
&apos;cause we laughed about it .
beth was hot , and tre had no game , so ...
we didn &apos;t know how he pulled that .
overruled .
mr. minson ...
what is your sexual preference ?
i &apos;m gay .
and does mr. crockett know that ?
objection as to what mr. crockett knows .
i &apos;ll allow it .
yes .
when i came out in tenth grade ,
he was one of the first people i told .
and does mr. crockett ... hate you ?
no .
so does the accusation
that wayne killed tre because he was gay
seem odd to you ?
objection !
sustained .
no further questions .
i think that puts this hate crime insanity to rest .
no need to object . i &apos;ll withdraw .
thank you for inviting me to
the regional senior center of greater morton grove .
your work here is ...
... extraordinary .
and i know that my son , in his many years at ...
... in his years at
the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office
has thought often of the
good people of greater morton grove , especially ...
... especially ...
uh , especially the seniors .
and we &apos;re going to need everybody &apos;s help this weekend
to make this straw poll a success .
it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s not just the ...
it &apos;s not just ...
it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s not just the most dedicated voters
who @-@ who matter at a ...
at a straw poll .
what is she doing ?
it &apos;s ... it &apos;s a ...
she did that throughout the whole thing ?
yeah .
odd , huh ?
this is because i cut her schedule .
she &apos;s getting back at me .
i need to talk to that stupid ...
that was a terrific crowd .
oh . there &apos;s mom .
what &apos;s she doing ? is that the luncheon ?
no , that &apos;s something from today .
i &apos;ve lost my place .
yeah . how &apos;s she doing ?
the straw poll ...
well , um ...
struggling .
well , she needs to get her sea legs back .
by the way , she said you cut her speaking schedule .
why don &apos;t i head out ?
did you ? did you , uh ...
cut her schedule down ?
yes .
jackie has ...
tanked a few speeches .
really ? i thought she seemed good .
peter , we discussed this at the beginning .
i am the strategist .
i have to be given leeway to decide strategy .
yes , and i &apos;m the candidate .
and my mother &apos;s had a stroke ,
and she wants to be involved .
involve her .
i &apos;ll see what i can do .
mr. minson .
you testified that mr. crockett had no problem with gay people .
do you know if he had any gay friends besides you ?
i don &apos;t know . i never met any .
could it be he didn &apos;t really view you as a gay friend ,
he viewed you as a childhood friend ?
i guess .
you said that , uh , tre had &quot; no game &quot; when it came to women .
what did you mean by that ?
he ... he wasn &apos;t exactly a man &apos;s man .
meaning he was effeminate .
you could say that .
did wayne crockett say that ?
objection . hearsay .
i &apos;ll rephrase .
did you ever see wayne mock tre for being girlish ?
yes , but wayne was just busting balls , you know ?
did wayne make fun of other men for being girlish ?
your honor , objection .
one at a time .
this has become absurd .
what happened to liability ?
liability is dependent on whether it &apos;s a hate crime or not .
but you keep changing the nature of the hate .
first it was a hate crime against a gay man ,
and now it &apos;s a hate crime against men who are ...
i shouldn &apos;t put words in your mouth , mr. andrews .
how would you put it ?
swishy .
so now it &apos;s a hate crime against &quot; swishy &quot; people ,
who are not gay .
i &apos;m alluding to effeminate mannerisms
which the jury is entitled to conclude are a proxy for homosexuality .
your honor , a mannerism is not a protected class .
指的是那些一旦被当作歧视和侵犯的理由即属违法的人的特征 如种族 年龄
there are effeminate heterosexuals ,
and effeminate homosexuals ,
which is why the essence of gayness is
an actual sexual act .
so there &apos;s no such thing as an abstinent gay man ?
or a gay man who marries a woman ?
if an effeminate man marries a woman
and doesn &apos;t sleep with men ,
then yes , that man is not gay .
and if someone kills an abstinent gay man ,
you &apos;re saying that &apos;s not a hate crime ?
we &apos;re saying that you can &apos;t commit a hate crime
against a mannerism .
but you can if that mannerism is a proxy
for a protected class .
okay . very provocative , mr. andrews .
but as a matter of law ,
i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s true .
as my wife would say ,
&quot; the law can &apos;t address everything . &quot;
yes , but when the law can &apos;t ,
the jury must .
yes . true .
my wife would agree with that , too .
i &apos;m willing to say it &apos;s a question of fact ,
and the province of the jury .
i &apos;ll allow .
what ?
i said , i &apos;ll allow .
thank you , your honor .
is that a picture of your wife , there ?
no .
sorry . thank you .
so . &quot; swishiness . &quot;
no .
but jackie won &apos;t listen to me .
i &apos;m not talking to her about campaign events .
alicia ...
they &apos;re not gonna pursue this .
if i have a record ,
i &apos;m never gonna be able to get a nursing job .
prostitution is a class four felony .
because you have no priors ...
look , i &apos;m just asking you
to help me keep her on the reservation .
i have no leverage over her ; you do .
when did all these favors start multiplying ?
oh , right . how &apos;d it go with maddie ?
okay . i have to work .
you want to keep jackie in line , give her something .
what do you mean ?
something that makes her feel valued . important . useful .
but she is none of those things .
a point you made clear to her .
now ... un @-@ make it .
yeah , who &apos;s this ?
alicia florrick &apos;s desk .
we &apos;ll get you probation .
what ?
okay .
you keep your nose clean .
no , no , kalinda &apos;s on it .
that &apos;s great !
you wait a few years , you come back ...
just make sure you get it on tape .
... we &apos;ll get the conviction expunged .
are you sure ?
and get the file over to me as soon as you can .
it &apos;ll be like the arrest never happened .
no , he should be cooperative .
yes , of course , not a problem .
he doesn &apos;t want a ...
what ?
do you need me to talk louder ?
no , this should pick it up .
um , thanks , this really helps with my notes .
oh , no problem . i have nothing to hide .
you said you slept with peter florrick
at his suite at the st. martin hotel
on september the 30th .
yes .
and how did you guys meet ?
well , there was a rally
at the springfield fairgrounds that day ,
i volunteered to register voters .
peter and i just kind of ... hit it off .
what did you talk about ?
oh , stuff .
i said i was hoping to go to law school .
he gave me his room number ,
told me to swing by after 10 : 00 to discuss career options .
and this was his room on the 15th floor ?
yes .
and you &apos;re on ?
oh , the eighth floor . all the workers were .
okay . so you went up to his suite at what time ?
around 11 , i guess .
and did you have a key to his room ?
no .
the plan was just to knock on his door ,
and he would let me in .
okay , good .
oh , uh , was anybody else with you
in the elevator when you went up ?
no , i made sure i was alone .
i didn &apos;t want anyone else to see me .
of course .
uh , how did you get the concierge key ?
how did i ... ? what do you mean ?
the concierge key-- how @-@ how did you get it ?
i don &apos;t know what that is .
you pushed for the 15th floor , right ?
when you went into the elevator , you didn &apos;t do anything else .
right .
see , the problem is ,
mr. florrick was staying on the concierge floor ,
and you can &apos;t gain access to that floor
unless you have a special card key ,
or unless you went up with someone in the elevator who did .
but i was there .
no , you weren &apos;t . you couldn &apos;t have been .
well , wait , maybe there was someone else on the elevator ,
going to the 15th floor .
indira , you &apos;re lying .
no , i &apos;m not .
yes , you are .
okay , you know what ?
i don &apos;t want to talk to you anymore .
i think it &apos;s fairly clear
that ms. starr has fabricated this story .
or she simply forgot about the concierge key .
or she &apos;s really an alien impersonating miss starr .
either way , i think you &apos;re a little
too close to this story , mandy .
so are you .
the tape &apos;s not conclusive either way .
ms.sharma , what did you observe
about ms.starr &apos;s demeanor ?
she was nervous .
covering for an obvious gap in the narrative .
so in your opinion ?
she was lying .
i don &apos;t have any doubt about it .
i do .
there are other indicia of reliability here .
merely because an investigator with an agenda
catches a young girl up in an inconsistency ...
richard , can i have a word ?
look , i played ball .
i made the florricks available .
peter sat down with mandy twice .
we appreciate that .
then you should appreciate that they denied the affair .
at the end of the day , all you have is
some young woman &apos;s uncorroborated allegations
which we have gutted .
here &apos;s where you tell me
you have a lawsuit waiting in the wings .
oh , i wouldn &apos;t insult you , richard .
this isn &apos;t your first time at the rodeo .
and it &apos;s not mine .
what this comes down to is facts .
and you don &apos;t have them .
so you &apos;re serving time for drowning tre lawson ?
yes .
your friend says you didn &apos;t like him .
yes , it &apos;s true , i didn &apos;t like tre .
why not ?
he was cheap .
he &apos;d make snide comments about people &apos;s clothing .
whine about two @-@ a @-@ day practices .
anything else ?
he was arrogant .
treated me like i wasn &apos;t black enough .
what does that mean ?
i come from the suburbs .
he &apos;s from the south side of chicago .
he &apos;d call me an oreo . say i &apos;m not authentic .
did any of your hostility towards him stem from
behavior you thought was effeminate ?
no .
my only problem with tre was that
he was a jerk .
thank you .
&quot; oreo &quot;
used like that , it &apos;s mighty offensive , isn &apos;t it ?
yeah .
which fraternity did you belong to ?
omega delta omega .
the black fraternity , right ?
yes .
would you say the kids in your fraternity
are light @-@ skinned like you or dark @-@ skinned like tre ?
your honor , objection .
what hate crime is the defense selling today ?
black @-@ on @-@ black .
wow , they &apos;re just relentless .
he has a theory of the case
and he &apos;s looking for the facts to satisfy it .
unfortunately , the judge is letting him run with it .
so black @-@ on @-@ black hate crime ? hmm .
and you think there &apos;s truth to it ?
they were in rival fraternities ,
and there were previous fights .
but that &apos;s good .
why ? what do you mean ?
it &apos;s good that there were fights .
you &apos;re losing me .
this isn &apos;t about a hate crime .
this is about liability .
put the coach back on the stand .
i &apos;ll take him .
coach shank , in its 50 @-@ year existence ,
the water polo team never had members of
both omega delta omega and pi gamma phi on its roster
at the same time . why is that ?
we &apos;ve only had a handful of black athletes
in the program &apos;s history .
so you weren &apos;t aware of animosity
between these two fraternities ?
i was not .
this is a 2008 report
by cpt &apos;s j.a. citing pi mmmma phi and omega delta omega for their role in
a bowling alley brawl .
is that you on the distribution list ?
yeah . but i don &apos;t remember receiving it .
were you aware that wayne crockett was a member of omega delta omega ?
yes .
were you aware that
tre lawson pledged pi gamma phi a week before his death ?
no .
this picture
was posted on
tre lawson &apos;s facebook memorial page .
it &apos;s a photo of a recent team practice , right ?
yeah .
the person just to your left is tre lawson .
could you tell the jury
what the insignia on his shirt says ?
pi gamma phi .
your honor , i &apos;m not sure what ms. lockhart &apos;s point is .
mr. andrews convinced the court to let him present
his black @-@ on @-@ black hate crime theory to the jury .
so if coach shank knew
that the victim and perpetrator belonged
to rival organizations ...
wait a minute .
you can &apos;t prove mr. crockett drowned mr. lawson
because he was black .
actually , mr. andrews ,
you already did .
all ms. lockhart proved
was that the university knew about the animus .
step back .
how much ?
$ 6 million . our original ask .
you seem pretty happy with yourself .
i like the law .
we &apos;re gonna get our firm back .
then we &apos;re gonna go after louis canning &apos;s firm ,
then we &apos;re gonna open up a branch in new york
and d.c.
it feels pretty good , doesn &apos;t it ?
what &apos;s that , winning ?
no . nothing to lose .
welcome to the lifeboat .
okay , you hand them the t @-@ shirts ,
you give them the tickets ,
you walk them to the ballot . understand ?
do not take anyone for granted .
eli , it &apos;s mandy .
you walk them all the way .
okay , spread out .
two months i worked on that story , eli .
you managed to kill it with one conversation . nice work .
oh , mandy , i know you think i must relish this moment ,
but it gives me no pleasure wasting my time
to prove you wasted yours .
here , have a sausage .
she was a naive 25 @-@ year @-@ old ,
who was overcome by the occasion .
i still stand by my story .
mm @-@ hmm . really ? i gotta go .
hello , alicia .
jackie .
the two of us ,
i know we haven &apos;t always seen eye to eye ,
but i just want you to know how much ...
i &apos;m sorry i doubted you , alicia .
standing by peter the way you &apos;re doing .
he needs you now . and i &apos;m just ...
i &apos;m just so glad you &apos;re there for him .
thank you ... jackie .
jackie ?
what ?
are you okay ?
hello ?
mr. eli gold ?
who &apos;s this ?
jimmy v. i run a political blog .
oh , well , let me get you our press secretary .
no , that &apos;s all right .
i &apos;m about to publish a story saying
a national magazine is sitting on a piece
accusing peter florrick of sleeping with a campaign worker .
i &apos;d like to get a quote from the campaign .
did i lose you ?
no .
where are you getting this ?
an anonymous tip .
i see .
well , it &apos;s a lie and it &apos;s defamatory .
and if i were you , jimmy v. ,
i would take a breath before you post anything actionable .
is that your quote ?
what &apos;s the blog ?
pooranarchy.com. all one word .
never heard of it .
