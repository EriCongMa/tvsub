their hearts-- they were ripped out .
when people fall under a sleeping curse ,
the soul travels to a netherworld .
wear this while you &apos;re sleeping .
once you control the journey , fear will stop .
there was a little boy . he talked to me .
he said his name was henry .
i arranged for transport with cora .
there &apos;s an enchanted compass .
if you promise to take me along ,
i &apos;ll help you obtain it before she does .
what are you doing ?
you &apos;re just gonna leave me here to die ?
swan ! swan !
my dear captain ,
it seems you &apos;ve been on quite an adventure .
the compass , please .
yes , that . well ...
matters grew complicated .
it &apos;s eluded me for the moment .
the details of the affair are a bit of a bore .
really ?
stealing my protection spell
and climbing the beanstalk without me
might seem like a bore to you ,
but to me , it &apos;s a betrayal .
i was gonna bring it to you .
our agreement remains .
we are going to storybrooke together .
i &apos;ll get it back .
i don &apos;t have time for your games .
i &apos;ve crossed through too many worlds
to be brought short at the brink of success .
who was it who bested you ?
the swan girl . emma .
rest assured , it won &apos;t happen again .
no , it won &apos;t .
you chose her
and the consequences of that decision .
are you gonna kill me now ?
go ahead . try .
so brave .
no , i &apos;m not going to kill you .
i have something far more satisfying in mind .
i &apos;m going to leave you here
with your thirst for revenge unquenched ,
while i complete our journey without you .
there &apos;s no need to be rash .
we can ...
discuss this .
your pretty face buys you a lot ,
but not my time .
it &apos;s too valuable .
i can do this .
i can get it back . you need me .
no , i don &apos;t .
you &apos;ve had your chance . now it &apos;s my turn to do this--
the right way .
rise .
the boy you saw in your dream-- is that him ?
yes . that &apos;s henry .
that &apos;s impossible .
it was a dream . how could you dream of my son ?
i have no idea .
maybe it wasn &apos;t a dream .
what ?
that room-- i &apos;ve been there .
when i told you about it , you didn &apos;t say anything .
you were terrified . i didn &apos;t want to make things worse
by telling you i thought it might be real .
a room in a dream is real ?
the sleeping curse .
it has to be . i went through it . aurora went through it .
henry &apos;s been through it because i wouldn &apos;t believe him .
emma .
what else did you lie about ?
i was--i wasn &apos;t lying .
i was protecting you .
what did he say--henry-- in the--in the dream ?
he just said his name .
and then i woke up , and it was over .
emma .
it &apos;s going to be okay .
we are so far from okay .
no . we have a way home now .
we have a compass ,
and the wardrobe ashes are still with cora .
any attempt to steal from her would be suicide .
not anymore .
we can stop her .
how ?
i don &apos;t know ,
but i know someone who does--
rumplestiltskin .
he &apos;ll know a way .
henry . we can talk to him .
now we can communicate .
wait . wait .
oh , yeah , princess ,
you &apos;re going back to sleep .
henry !
henry !
henry !
henry !
hello ?
hello !
henry !
henry , it is you !
yeah !
who are you ?
my name is aurora . i &apos;m with your mom
and your grandmother .
are they okay ?
yes , they &apos;re fine . they just want to come home ,
and they need your help .
okay , so what do i need to do ?
t @-@ they &apos;re alive .
they &apos;re alive !
who ? who &apos;s alive ?
my mom and snow .
i told you , kid . i told ya !
was it that woman you saw ? did she tell you this ?
her name &apos;s aurora . she said they have a way home ,
but there &apos;s someone in their way--
someone they need us to help them stop ,
someone only mr. gold knows how to defeat .
who ?
your mother .
they smell delicious , granny .
they are delicious . didn &apos;t take any dark magic either .
oh , and , uh , i charge extra for the pickles .
i have a complicated relationship with her ,
as i do with most people .
well , it , uh , it did take me a little time to get to know you .
they will .
you know , you should try it with ketchup .
condiments are this world &apos;s most powerful magic .
gold ...
we need to talk .
do we ?
folks , i think i may need to close early .
uh , everybody out .
no . it &apos;s okay . we &apos;re civil .
yeah , for now .
belle , you remember the woman who locked you up for 28 years .
uh , i should probably just get--
no . no . please stay where you are .
whatever she has to say won &apos;t be a secret from you .
whatever she wants ,
she won &apos;t get .
i &apos;m actually coming about
the one thing that might unite us .
and what on earth can that be ?
cora .
she &apos;s coming from our land .
i need your help to stop her .
but she was dead .
you told me you saw the body .
apparently , you taught her well .
she &apos;s not ,
and she &apos;s on her way , and i don &apos;t think i need to remind you
how most unpleasant that would be for both of us .
for you .
i can handle cora .
that &apos;s not how she tells the story .
i won in the end .
maybe .
but there &apos;s a big difference this time .
this time you have someone you care about .
this time you have a weakness .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry . who--who is this woman ?
someone you &apos;ll never meet .
so you say she &apos;s coming .
where is she now ?
with them .
how close are we ?
henry could already be waiting in that netherworld .
no , we planned to meet back there in two hours .
you &apos;re not going to leave him waiting .
yeah , but what if he &apos;s--
no , he was fine .
there . that looks like relatively safe high ground .
we &apos;ll set up camp there .
aurora , you &apos;ll settle in and find henry ,
get the information we need from rumplestiltskin .
we do this fast , in and out .
it &apos;s still dangerous out here .
is something wrong ?
no , just caught on something .
that does not explain your arm .
what about my arm ?
the burns you &apos;re hiding-- they &apos;re not from the sun .
i ... brushed against a poison leaf .
you said that this netherworld was full of smoke and flames .
aurora , if that &apos;s where you were burned ,
you should not return .
i don &apos;t have much of a choice , do i ?
you &apos;re choosing to go in deeper
and staying under longer to find this boy .
i vowed to prince phillip to protect you ,
not to help some strangers
find a portal to another land .
mulan , i was cursed to spend eternity in that horrible sleep ,
and the only reason i &apos;m here is
because you and phillip risked your lives to save me .
every day since my waking has been a gift ,
so let me do something with it .
it &apos;s my turn to help someone else .
i &apos;m going to go back in and find that boy .
i brought your blanket
from your bedroom back home .
thanks .
so cora-- she &apos;s pretty powerful ?
yes , but , uh , not as powerful as i am .
debatable .
actually , no , it &apos;s not .
you sure you &apos;re okay to do this , kid ?
i was born to do this .
i &apos;m done reading about heroes .
i wanna be one .
well , sometimes being one is knowing
when not to run into the fire .
i &apos;ll be okay .
look , whatever he faces in there
will be far less dangerous than what he &apos;ll face if we fail .
i can do this .
get on with it .
fast .
all right , henry .
just relax .
and soon ,
you &apos;re gonna drift off .
what do i tell them ?
just listen to my bedtime story ,
and all will be clear .
once upon a time ,
snow white and prince charming
needed to stun a very powerful magician
long enough to lock him up
in a dark dungeon .
that was you .
they used cinderella to trap you with a magic quill .
yes , indeed , a quill .
and yet ,
it wasn &apos;t the quill itself ,
but the ink that captured the dark one ,
harvested from the rarest species of squid
from the bottom of a bottomless ocean--
impossible to find
unless you &apos;re a mermaid ...
or me .
i happen to have a private supply .
in my jail cell--
that is where they will find it .
hey .
it &apos;ll be okay . you &apos;ll see henry again .
this will work .
what was that ?
henry !
henry !
oh ! can you help us ?
yes ! i know what you have to do to stop cora !
you have to go to ...
rumplestiltskin &apos;s cell !
where ? we have to go where ? oh !
wait . where do we have to go ? !
rumplestiltskin &apos;s jail cell !
henry ! henry , i--
aurora !
who is that ?
did you hear me ? !
no ! henry , say it again !
aurora .
did you hear that ?
no ! aurora , what &apos;s going on ? !
aurora !
do you hear that ?
aurora ! wake up !
aurora , wake up ! wake up !
no . henry wasn &apos;t finished .
the time for that is over .
emma , watch out !
the compass !
the compass !
any idea how to kill these things ?
none !
mulan !
mulan ?
where is she ?
emma , we &apos;ve got to run for it !
come on hurry . aurora , go .
no !
aurora !
you &apos;re still in one piece ?
yeah . pretty much .
they took her .
aurora &apos;s gone .
henry , are you all right ?
did you see her ? did you tell her ?
no . i @-@ i didn &apos;t get the chance .
something-- something happened .
she--she got sucked out of there .
henry .
some @-@ something &apos;s wrong .
henry .
i thought you might be hungry .
i hope you enjoy stew .
i enjoy anything that masks the bitter aftertaste of poison .
oh , plucky .
i like that .
you might as well go . i &apos;m not gonna tell you anything .
oh , i know .
that &apos;s all right . you &apos;ve nothing to tell .
you weren &apos;t my target .
the compass-- sad you lost it ?
i suppose ,
but now i have something to trade for .
they &apos;ll never trade me for that .
you might be more valuable than you know .
to who ? they just met me ,
and they &apos;re trying to get back to their families .
do you really think they &apos;ll sacrifice that for a stranger ?
your newfound companions ?
you may not know them , but i do .
snow and her daughter just can &apos;t help themselves .
no matter the personal stakes ,
they won &apos;t let an innocent die .
we shall see .
and what stakes do you have in their cause , princess ?
it &apos;s not as though you &apos;d travel back with them .
what a sweet , misguided notion .
did you really think you could have a life there ?
find another prince ?
you &apos;ve forgotten phillip already .
phillip is in my heart every moment of every day .
if there was anything i could do to bring him back , i would .
is that so ?
what if i told you that when a wraith consumes a soul ,
it merely travels to another realm ,
but that soul could be brought back to this world ?
show me a little courtesy ,
and i may explain how .
oh ! you stupid , ungrateful girl !
i &apos;m not as stupid as you think ,
nor my loyalty so easily bought !
you can bring me a hundred meals and make me a hundred promises ,
but i will never help you !
plucky .
mm . tell them .
what the hell was that ?
cora .
we have until sundown to bring her the compass .
if we don &apos;t , she &apos;ll kill aurora .
give it to me .
hold on , mulan . just give us a minute to consider .
there &apos;s nothing to consider .
a compass is not worth aurora &apos;s life .
we need a plan
to get back aurora and keep the compass .
my vow to phillip was to protect aurora .
that promise is all that is left of him ,
so it shall be done .
i climbed a beanstalk for this . you will get your own .
give it to me .
mulan . mulan .
give us a few hours , please .
if we haven &apos;t defeated cora by then ,
you can have the compass .
you can &apos;t hope to defeat her .
we no longer have access to the dark one &apos;s assistance .
yes , we do .
how ? aurora &apos;s gone .
aurora isn &apos;t the only one who &apos;s been under a sleeping curse .
i can go back to that netherworld .
the door to that place is closed . you said it yourself .
there may be a way--
a way for me to go back into a deep slumber ,
one that can let me access it again .
another sleeping curse ?
no . no not another curse . i don &apos;t need one .
i &apos;ve been under already .
i need to go into a sleep
where my natural defenses slip away ,
where my mind stops protecting me .
how ?
your sleeping powder--
if i inhale it , i will fall into a deep enough sleep
that i should be able to do this .
i used the last of it on the giant .
then make some more .
the poppy plant is extremely rare in this kingdom ,
but i know of a place that may grow some more .
it &apos;s a bit of a journey from here .
can we make it by sundown ?
we have to hurry .
here .
let me take care of this .
what caused this ?
when you venture deeper into the netherworld instead of away ,
there are risks .
someone woke aurora before her soul
was ready to return .
the violence of that act tore her away
and injured henry .
we &apos;re lucky it wasn &apos;t worse .
he &apos;s gonna need some time to recover before he can be sent back .
out of the question .
not a chance in hell .
we &apos;d be monsters to even consider risking his life again .
careful with your tone , charming .
i understand your concern for the boy , but i know cora .
without our help , snow and emma will soon be dead .
and then ...
a true monster will be on her way to storybrooke .
aurora is gone .
why do we need to send henry back to that fiery inferno
with no one there to receive our message ?
because someone will be there .
who ?
snow .
that &apos;s an awfully big assumption .
no . no , it &apos;s not . she was there once before .
she can go back . she can find a way .
she will . i know it .
and i &apos;ll be waiting .
you &apos;re going to this netherworld ?
i faced you . how bad could it be ?
it &apos;s not as simple as that .
you can &apos;t get there .
you haven &apos;t been under a sleeping curse .
well , then put me under one .
if we do that , there &apos;s a chance you might never waken up .
sure , i will .
when i see her , she &apos;ll kiss me , and i &apos;ll be fine .
now put me under . i &apos;ve spent far too much time looking for my wife .
it is time to bring her home .
wake up . wake up .
come on , sweetheart . wake up . wake up .
wake up .
on your feet . hurry .
no . no . are you gonna kill me ?
if i were here for that ,
then waking you first might not be the best course of action .
aah ! so what ? did cora send you ?
cora has no idea i &apos;m here .
i don &apos;t-- i don &apos;t understand .
look , i know you &apos;re sleepy , but isn &apos;t it obvious ?
i &apos;m setting you free .
what is this , some sort of pirate &apos;s ruse ?
cora &apos;s denied me passage to storybrooke
and my vengeance .
and now i &apos;m gonna deny her hell wishes ,
starting with the compass .
in pirate terms ,
you might say i &apos;m firing a shot across my enemy &apos;s bow .
you &apos;d risk your life to break in here
all so you could thwart cora ?
i don &apos;t like being double @-@ crossed .
now go .
thank you .
you can thank me by doing me one favor .
what ?
give emma a message .
tell her that the deal still stands .
if she provides me passage back to her realm ,
i swear ,
i will help her find that dust that opens the portal .
you really want to assist us ?
it hurts cora and helps me . of course i do .
now go .
once we crest this ridge ,
we &apos;ll be near the woods of the dead .
the last poppies in this realm have taken seed there .
you okay ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine .
hey . wait . wait . no . no . no . you look nervous .
this netherworld-- how bad is it ?
what &apos;s it like ?
it &apos;s like you &apos;re , um ...
lost ,
drifting in the dark ,
no one to talk to , nothing to do
except think of all the people that you love
and how you &apos;ll never see them again .
henry was lost in that dark , too , because of me .
what are you talking about ?
he tried so hard to convince me i was the savior .
stop it .
nobody would &apos;ve believed henry &apos;s stories .
but his mother should have .
okay .
you wanna play the blame game ?
if i hadn &apos;t told cora about regina &apos;s true love ,
cora never would &apos;ve killed him ,
regina wouldn &apos;t want revenge ,
the curse never would have happened .
we could spend all day trying to figure out
why each of us should feel guilty ,
but it will not help us get home .
you really think we &apos;re gonna make it back ?
if there &apos;s one thing your father &apos;s taught me ,
it &apos;s not to give up .
now it &apos;s time for me to go back to sleep .
it &apos;s regina .
what ?
regina .
that &apos;s who we should blame .
it smells funny .
i know , sweetheart .
it &apos;s a curse .
it &apos;s not meant to be pleasant .
so the potion &apos;s finished ?
mr. gold had everything you needed in his shop ?
yes .
we &apos;re almost ready .
so this is how you do it ?
magic ?
there are many ways .
it &apos;s never easy .
and ...
have you been using magic ?
henry , i told you i wouldn &apos;t ,
and i haven &apos;t ,
except for ...
with daniel ...
and now .
i &apos;ve really been trying .
it &apos;s okay .
at least you &apos;re using it to help people now .
i &apos;m trying .
and after this ,
i won &apos;t .
i know .
will david be okay ?
he &apos;ll be ...
asleep .
and in there , he won &apos;t die .
gold &apos;s explaining everything to him right now .
yeah .
it should be me .
i can go in there without a curse and still come back .
henry , david and i have many differences ,
but on this , we agree .
we won &apos;t let you risk your safety . it &apos;s just not worth it .
it is to me .
he won &apos;t wake up .
unless he succeeds .
and if there &apos;s one thing i know about your grandparents ...
they always find each other .
it &apos;s beautiful .
i &apos;ll use my dagger to crush the seeds .
we &apos;re doing this the old @-@ fashioned way .
what do you mean , the old @-@ fashioned way ?
you &apos;re about to join a quite distinguished club , mr. nolan .
before such innovations as the apple ,
back when the sleeping curse first came to be ,
a more direct method was required--
through blood .
by pricking one &apos;s finger on the needle of a spinning wheel ,
one falls under the spell .
your majesty , you did his wife .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;d like the honors .
it &apos;s all yours .
good luck .
it &apos;s gonna be all right .
how do you know ?
how did you know emma would save you after you ate the turnover ?
i believed in her .
the way snow and i believed
she &apos;d come back to break the curse .
that &apos;s the kind of faith that runs in our family .
this helps control the flames in the room .
it &apos;ll keep you safe .
i will guard it with my life .
the powder &apos;s nearly ready .
how long will the effects last ?
it &apos;s difficult to say ,
maybe an hour or much less .
well , i shouldn &apos;t need much time
as long as henry &apos;s in there when i am .
i &apos;ll be right here .
say hi to my son for me .
when i awake , i &apos;ll be in that fiery room ?
not exactly .
that room is where
those who &apos;ve already awoken from the curse return .
you , however , are being put under for the first time .
then how will i know where to go ?
how the hell am i supposed to find a room with no door ?
and that , dearie ,
is the conundrum we &apos;re all depending on you solving .
now i say this with the utmost sincerity--
good luck .
snow !
henry ?
henry ?
henry ?
henry !
where are you ? !
the room .
charming ?
charming ?
snow !
i don &apos;t understand .
i ha--
henry should be here .
i wouldn &apos;t let him come back . this is ...
this is too dangerous .
you found me .
you found me .
i knew you &apos;d be here .
i don &apos;t know how much time we have .
gold--he says there &apos;s a way to stop cora .
we have to stun her , like we did with him .
the quill . it wasn &apos;t the quill . it was the ink .
there &apos;s a jar of it in his cell , where we kept him .
get it .
get it , stop her , and come home .
charming , how are you here ?
there &apos;s no way for you to be here unless ...
i had to see you .
you &apos;re in a sleeping curse .
it was worth it .
but now you &apos;re cursed .
a curse you &apos;re gonna break with true love &apos;s kiss .
now ...
no .
it &apos;s a netherworld .
we &apos;re not really here .
i &apos;m waking up .
it &apos;s okay .
you &apos;ll get back ,
and then you &apos;ll wake me , as i woke you .
you will always find me , and i will always find you .
yes . will we always lose each other , too ?
is that our fate ?
no .
i refuse to believe that .
you need to have faith ... in us .
i &apos;m waking up .
it &apos;s okay .
you can do this .
charming .
i love you .
i love y--
come on .
come back .
should he be in there so long ?
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s fine .
i imagine they &apos;re just catching up .
hey . you okay ?
what--what happened ?
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m looking for more powder .
i &apos;m pretty sure we &apos;re out of that . what happened ?
no . i have to go back in . he &apos;s all alone .
henry ? what ?
is he okay ?
no . david .
he went under a sleeping spell so he could see me .
he thought that my kiss would wake him , but it didn &apos;t ,
and now he &apos;s trapped .
okay , slow down .
david is trapped in there ?
i have to get back .
there &apos;s only one way to help him .
true love &apos;s kiss .
yes , but it won &apos;t work in there .
we have to get back . if we don &apos;t--
we will .
we will .
now you &apos;re so sure ?
yes .
you told me to have faith , and now i &apos;m telling you .
we will make it back .
okay ?
did you get the information ?
it &apos;s rumplestiltskin .
he said the key to stopping her is in his jail cell .
okay . then let &apos;s go get it .
come on . get your stuff .
come on .
no .
what ?
the compass is gone ...
and so is mulan .
looking for someone ?
oh , don &apos;t tell me you were dumb enough to let her go .
she was never gonna give you what you wanted anyway .
so you freed her
and stuck around for the petty satisfaction
of seeing me suffer ?
oh , watching you suffer is a tempting motivation ,
but it wasn &apos;t that .
well , then you must have a death wish .
you know i have to kill you .
you should try thanking me .
oh , really ? why is that ?
because i &apos;ve brought you a gift .
it &apos;s in the satchel .
what is it ?
customarily , surprise is part of the fun of gift @-@ giving .
open it .
is that ...
indeed it is ,
and with it , you &apos;ll get everything you want .
that was a warning shot .
try to run , and i promise the next one won &apos;t be .
how did you find me ?
i know a thing or two about tracking .
all we want is the compass .
very well .
give me the compass .
and seal aurora &apos;s fate ?
we learned how to overpower cora .
once we get what we need , we will defeat her ,
and aurora will be free .
another journey--just as i predicted there would be .
our best chance to save aurora is to make that trade now .
not gonna happen .
without that compass , we can &apos;t get home .
then i hope you &apos;re prepared to use that arrow .
stop !
okay , don &apos;t take this the wrong way ,
but how the hell did you get here ?
let mulan go .
i said , let her go .
were you followed ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t think so . cora may know i &apos;m gone ,
but she didn &apos;t see me escape .
how did you escape ?
it was hook .
he let me go .
why ?
because of you .
he said he wanted to prove to you
that you should &apos;ve trusted him , that if you had trusted him ...
you could &apos;ve defeated cora together .
that the two of you could &apos;ve gotten the remains
of the wardrobe .
without him , you &apos;ll have to go up against her all by yourself .
he only wants to help . i ...
i think he may care for you .
nice touch , that .
but you know she won &apos;t trust you .
ah , she doesn &apos;t have to .
all i need is for her to believe that i was genuine
in letting the girl go , which i wager she does now .
you &apos;re welcome .
impressive .
you took a heart .
now you &apos;ve a princess .
indeed i do .
now can we get on
with the business of going to storybrooke , together ?
why not ?
i hate to travel alone .
all we need is the compass .
which will soon be delivered .
did you find a way to stop cora ?
yes .
where are we going ?
rumplestiltskin &apos;s cell .
