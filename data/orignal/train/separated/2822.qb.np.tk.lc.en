phoebe found out about this lady ...
... who knew her parents , and i don &apos;t know what happened .
i &apos;m your mother .
monica joked she wouldn &apos;t date chandler .
i don &apos;t know what happened there either .
ross &apos; new girlfriend shows up .
rachel gets bonnie to shave her head . then they kiss .
now he has to choose rachel or the bald girl .
i don &apos;t know what happened there either .

she &apos;s helping me . my head &apos;s sunburned .
thanks a million .
you &apos;re welcome a million .

minty .
i &apos;ll be in our room .
oh , my god !
i know .
i got to go .
why ? why ?
i got to go break up with bonnie .
here ? now ?
i can &apos;t stay here all night .
if i go in there , she &apos;ll want to ...
... do stuff .
can &apos;t you say you aren &apos;t in the mood ?
no , she likes that .
faking sleep doesn &apos;t work .
i &apos;ve woken up many times with her
why am i telling you ?
i don &apos;t know .
not every morning
making it worse !
the one with the jellyfish
you probably want to know how it happened .
i think i can figure it out .
i was born , and then everyone lied their asses off .
no , it wasn &apos;t like that .
remember how i said lilly , frank and i were close ?
we were very close .
how close ?
the three of us were kind of a couple .
i don &apos;t know how that would work .
i &apos;m not asking !
anyhow , somehow i got pregnant ...
... and i was ...
... scared . i was stupid and selfish ....
i was 18 years old . remember what it was like to be 18 ?
mom killed herself and my dad ran off .
i lived in a gremlin with a guy who talked to his hand .
i &apos;m sorry . i thought i &apos;d left you with the best parents .
i didn &apos;t hear about them till a few years ago .
by then , you were already grown @-@ up .
you &apos;re here and i would really like to get to know you .
well , everybody does .
i &apos;m a really cool person .
you had 29 years to find out , but you didn &apos;t even try .
you walked out on me , and i &apos;ll do the same .
wait .
i don &apos;t ever want to see you again .
where &apos;s my purse ?
shoot ! we &apos;re out of soda .
i &apos;ll get you some .
really ?
no , because i &apos;m not your boyfriend .
hey , pheebs , how &apos;d it go ?
my mom &apos;s friend , phoebe , is actually my birth mom .
i found a dried @-@ up seahorse .
what do you mean ?
my new mom , who &apos;s a big fat abandoner .
don &apos;t you want to stay here and talk about it ?
i need to be alone .
monica .
man . hey ..... what if you found out that your mom wasn &apos;t really your mom ...
... and your new mom turned out to be really hot ?
oh , man , huh ?
but , it &apos;s your mom .
no , i &apos;m talking about your mom .
it &apos;s over .
was it awful ?
it was long .
i didn &apos;t realize how late it was ...
... till i saw the five o &apos;clock shadow on her head .
she didn &apos;t want to stay . i called a cab . she just left .
i wrote you a letter .
oh , thank you !
i like mail .
it &apos;s just some things i &apos;ve been thinking about . about us .
before we even think about us getting back together ...
... i need to know how you feel about this stuff .
it &apos;s 5 : 30 in the morning .
so i &apos;d better get cracking on this baby .
i &apos;ll be waiting for you . come up when you &apos;re done .
i &apos;ll be up ...
... in 18 pages .
front and back .
very exciting !
what happened to you ? why didn &apos;t you come up ?
done .
you just finished ?
i wanted to be thorough .
this is clearly very important to you . to us .
i wanted to read every word carefully .
twice .
so ... does it ?
i &apos;m sorry ?
does it ?
does it ? does it ?
i wanted to give that whole &quot; does it ? &quot; part another glance .
what do you mean ? you said you read it twice .
it either does or doesn &apos;t . if you have to think
no , i don &apos;t have to think about it .
in fact ...
... i &apos;ve decided . i have decided ...
... that it ...
... does .
are you sure ?
sure , i &apos;m sure !
there &apos;s a nuclear holocaust . i &apos;m the last man on earth .
would you go out with me ?
i &apos;ve got canned goods .
take a look at this !
check this baby out ! dug me a hole .
excellent hole , joe .
oh , no ! my hole !
my foot !
what is it ?
jellyfish sting ! it hurts !
can we help you to the house ?
it &apos;s two miles .
and i &apos;m tired from digging .
damn the jellyfish !
damn all the jellyfish !
do something .
there &apos;s only one thing .
what is it ?
pee on it .
gross !
i saw it on discovery channel .
he &apos;s right . there &apos;s ammonia in that ...
... that kills the pain .
forget it . it doesn &apos;t hurt that bad !
you can use my hole for privacy .
i &apos;m ready to get the hell out of here .
are you ?
that &apos;s so great !
not for bonnie .
but for you , yea !
how was the beach ?
nothing . i don &apos;t know .
what happened ?
nothing .
i &apos;m going to shower .
me too .
me too .
i &apos;ll put this in the car .
i have to go pack !
and it really does ?
lt does .
it really and truly does .
it so does not !
she wants me to take responsibility for everything that went wrong .
she goes on for five pages about how i was unfaithful to her .
we were on a break !
if you say that one more time , i &apos;ll break up with you .
this breakup was not all my fault . she says here ...
... &quot; lf you accept full responsibility ...
... i can begin to trust you again .
does that seem like something you can do ? does it ? &quot;
no
you have what you want . you &apos;re back with her .
if you bring this up now , you &apos;ll wreck it .
yeah , i know . you &apos;re right .
i &apos;ll let it go .
but you know how hard it is to forget this ?
sure , it &apos;s hard ...
... but you don &apos;t have to talk about it .
a lot happened on that trip ... that we should never , ever talk about .
what happened on that beach ?
it &apos;s between us and the sea , ross .
hi , ursula .
i know that we haven &apos;t talked in a long time .
our mom is not our birth mom . this other lady is our birth mom .
right , the one that lives in montauk .
you know her ?
no . i read about her in mom &apos;s suicide note .
there was a suicide note ? do you still have it ?
hang on .
i can &apos;t believe you didn &apos;t tell me there was a suicide note .
yeah , so how have you been doing ?
shut up !
&quot; goodbye , phoebe and ursula . i &apos;ll miss you .
p.s. your mom lives in montauk . &quot;
you just wrote this !
it &apos;s pretty much the gist .
except for the poem . you read the poem , right ?
no
all right . hang on .
pass the cheese , please .
you can &apos;t even look at me , can you ?
no
it &apos;s phoebe ! we can talk to phoebe !
i &apos;m too depressed to talk .
i &apos;ll give you $ 1000 to talk to us .
what about making that beach trip an annual thing ?
no
what happened out there ?
what ? we took a walk . nothing happened .
i came back with nothing all over me .
what happened ? joey ?
all right.-no !
we swore we &apos;d never tell .
they &apos;ll never understand .
we have to get it out . it &apos;s eating me alive !
monica got stung by a jellyfish .
all right !
right
i got stung .
stung bad .
i couldn &apos;t stand .
i couldn &apos;t walk .
we were two miles from the house .
we were scared and alone .
we didn &apos;t think we could make it .
i was in too much pain .
and i was tired from digging .
then joey remembered something .
i &apos;d seen it on discovery channel .
wait , i saw that .
on the discovery channel . about jellyfish and how if you
you peed on yourself ?
you can &apos;t say that ! you don &apos;t know !
i thought i would pass out .
i tried , but i couldn &apos;t ...
... bend that way .
so
that &apos;s right . i stepped up .
she &apos;s my friend and she needed help .
if i had to , i &apos;d pee on any of you .
only ...
... i couldn &apos;t .
i got the stage fright .
i wanted to help , but there was too much pressure .
so i turned to chandler .
joey kept screaming at me , &quot; do it now . do it . do it now ! &quot;
sometimes , late at night , i can still hear the screaming .
because i do it through my wall to freak you out .
maybe there &apos;s somebody you guys could talk to .
oh , who ? it &apos;s not like they have a group for people like us .
yeah , no , there &apos;s this guy owen , he &apos;s the best .
might have his card .
and fuchsia and mauve
those are the 66 colors of my bedroom
thank you
i invite all of you to count the colors in your bedroom .
except for you . you go away .
i &apos;ll go in a second .
i just want to tell you ...
... there wasn &apos;t a day i didn &apos;t regret giving you up .
okay , bye .
i &apos;m not done .
the reason i never looked you up was because ...
... i was afraid you &apos;d react ...
... just like the way you &apos;re reacting now .
can &apos;t we just start from here ? please ?
no .
ok
sorry .
one last thing .
you came looking for family .
i &apos;m family .
i &apos;m it .
now i &apos;m done .
it &apos;s not like we &apos;re losing anything .
i guess you &apos;re right .
it &apos;s not like we know each other or have anything in common .
i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s not like ...
... we don &apos;t have anything in common .
i mean , i like pizza .
i like pizza !
wait , i like the beatles .
oh , my god ! so do l .
puppies . cute or ugly ?
so cute !
you see ?
but i &apos;m still mad at you .
i know .
i &apos;m mad at me too .
do you want to get something to eat ? i &apos;m kind of hungry .
hey ! me too ! uncanny .
it looks like rain and i don &apos;t have my umbrella .
me neither . i really hate that .
stop it . now you &apos;re just doing it to freak me out .
i missed you .
i missed you too .
i was so nervous about that letter .
but the way you owned up to everything ...
... it just showed me how much you &apos;ve grown .
i suppose .
you have , ross . you should give yourself credit .
my mom never thought this would work out .
she said , &quot; once a cheater , always a cheater . &quot;
i just wish we hadn &apos;t lost those four months .
but if time was what you needed to gain a little perspective ....
we were on a break !
coffeehouse ?
you bet .
it took two people to break up this relationship .
you and that girl , which yesterday you took full responsibility for .
i didn &apos;t know what i took responsibility for .
i didn &apos;t finish the letter .
i fell asleep .
you fell asleep ?
it was 5 : 30 in the morning .
and you had rambled on for 18 pages .
front and back !
by the way , y @-@ o @-@ u @-@ apostrophe @-@ r @-@ e means &quot; you are . &quot;
y @-@ o @-@ u @-@ r means &quot; your . &quot;
i can &apos;t believe i thought of getting back with you ! we are so over .
fine by me !
those spelling tips will be handy saturday nights at home ...
... playing scrabble with monica .
sorry !
all that sleep you &apos;ll miss wishing you were with me !
don &apos;t worry about me falling asleep .
i still have your letter !
just so you know , it &apos;s not that common .
it doesn &apos;t happen to every guy .
and it is a big deal !
i knew it !
gin .
we were playing gin ?
if we were a couple , we could play naked .
would you stop ?
okay . all right .
all right .
i think you &apos;re great .
i think you &apos;re sweet and smart ...
... and i love you .
but you &apos;ll always be the guy who peed on me .
