Infections are like sleeping monsters.
You can't see them.
You can't feel them.
But...
you must do everything in your power...
to contain them.
Because when the monsters wake up...
they're out of control.
Bailey, you shouldn't be here.
How is Seth Lepik?
The computer says access restricted.
They won't even let me check on my own patients.
They swabbed my nose.
They're swabbing everyone's noses.
Well, are they sitting everybody down for interviews?
'cause they think I did something wrong.
Now I think it's the grafts.
I narrowed it down to--
Look, Bailey,
they've isolated the strain of staph in your patients.
Now they need to find out how it spread.
Your job is to cooperate.
I've got Seth.
Now go answer their questions.
Please.
We are throwing Bailey under the bus.
Come on. That is not what we're doing.
No, it seems like that's exactly what we're doing.
Two of our patients are dead of the same post-op infection.
A third one's barely hanging on. It was time.
We get the C.D.C. in here and figure this thing out.
By treating Bailey like a criminal?
She hasn't done anything.
I hope that you're right.
Truth is, we don't know that yet.
C.D.C. is simply asking us
to temporarily freeze Bailey's files.
Oh, come on.
And that we not discuss this investigation with her.
So today, just keep your distance.
That is ridiculous.
Also I think now's the time to put out a statement.
No, no.
No. Whoa. Whoa. About what?
I mean, we don't even know
if Bailey's the source of this thing.
If one of ours is at fault
and we just sit on this information,
we look like we're trying to cover something up.
The only way to let the public know
that we can be objective is by being transparent.
Vote?
I'm just saying,
people should learn the news from us.
There's no news.
Okay, vote?
There's no news yet.
Vote. All in favor of no press release.
Okay. No press release. No statement. Clear?
Watch it, members only.
Promise me you'll be nice.
These guys are trying to take down Bailey.
They don't deserve nice.
No, not to the C.D.C. To Jason.
I'm nice to Jason.
Two minutes ago, you said, "Hey, I have
a surgery today with your d-bag boyfriend."
Yeah, but I said it with a smile.
Fine. I won't call the guy a d-bag.
At least not to his face, anyway.
I'm moving in with him.
So what do you think?
I think it's great.
Really?
No. I think the guy is a douche bag
who you've known for about two minutes,
and that makes you an idiot for moving in with him.
Alex--
I'll be nice!
I'm gonna rock this corner kick.
Later, I promise.
Right now I have a surprise for you.
Look who's here.
Grandma!
Oh, Ethan.
As you can see,
there aren't any residual effects from the surgery.
So... I can go home?
Well, I'd like to keep an eye on you for another few days.
Well, we can handle a few more days.
Right, buddy?
Hey, grandma, do you want to see dad?
I can take you.
Oh, uh, is that...
Can--can he--
Sure, sure.
He sees his dad every day. He chats up a storm.
He told him all about you coming to visit.
Dad's still unconscious.
That's because his brain is resting.
It's not uncommon after a trauma
for a person not to wake up right away.
And speaking of Paul, I'd like to see him, too.
If that's all right?
Ethan, do you feel up to
pushing your mom around in a wheelchair?
Oh, yeah.
Murphy?
I'm not supposed to talk to you about this.
Dr. Bailey.
Come in.
Tell me there is
someone down here that I can help.
It's five against one with the board today,
and I need a victory.
Bed three. Femur's broken. I'm sending him up to angio.
Okay.
Alert the press.
See what I mean?
You all right?
Matthew dumped me.
Because I lied to him about my virginity
like you told me to.
That's not--
I lied because I had something to lie about.
April, hold on a second--
You took my...
I shouldn't have let you, but I did, and now he's gone.
I'm not board certified, I'm not a virgin,
And everything I care about has been ruined because of you.
So you know what? Thank you. Thanks for that.
Six against one.
Help! Yeah, help! We need some help over here!
What happened?
God, I'm gonna pass out.
We lost some fingers.
A lot of fingers.
We--we had a tug-of-war.
With what, razor wire?
Even better. Clothesline.
Does anybody have the severed fingers?
Yeah, I got 'em. I got 'em.
Whoa! That's a lot of fingers.
Yeah, I counted six.
Oh, no, five. This one's a turkey dog.
"Sleeping Monster"
I would thank you
to take me through each operation.
Well, I mean, if you're looking for the source,
look at the grafts.
I used the same ones on each patient.
This part of our investigation
concerns your interaction with the infected patients
in the operating room, to the best of your memory.
I'd never used this brand before.
I remember not recognizing the company.
Uh, Dortmund or something--
Dr. Bailey,
we've looked at the grafts.
It's not the grafts.
May I begin?
Oh, I was expecting a probing.
That's really more of a gentle swabbing.
Speaking of probing,
I've decided to have the baby naturally,
but I know the second I start to scream,
Derek is gonna have them pump me full of drugs,
so I'm gonna need you there in my corner.
Yeah. Uh, I'm not gonna do that.
Uh, when babies come out, people poop on the table.
Cristina--
uh, no.
Karev. Can you make it fast?
Peckwell's H.L.H.S. mom is gonna be admitted.
We gotta go walk her through the procedure.
She wants me to watch her give birth.
You're gonna poop on the table.
I am not.
You are. Almost everybody does.
Okay, so I poop on the table.
It's part of the miracle of life.
It's nasty.
Did I ask you to watch me give birth?
No.
Cristina?
We have been friends a long time.
You want to know how?
By not watching each other poop.
Holla.
Well, the good news is, these wounds look salvageable.
I wasn't even gonna play, but my brother Al insisted.
And then we were losing, and Al was all...
"Wrap your hands with the rope..."
Then I... did.
What are you doing?
Uh, I just need to identify whose fingers are whose.
That looks like a pretty good match.
Yeah, except for the red nail polish.
Yes.
That's my sister-in-law's. Jane, good news.
Your manicure's intact.
Hi, Jane. I'm Dr. Avery.
You mind if I take a look here?
How's my daughter-- Frances?
Tony, how's Frankie?
It's bad, honey.
The bone's still sticking out.
This is all Gigantor's fault.
What's he doing at our reunion anyway?
He's not even related. He's uncle Tony's weird friend.
I didn't mean to pull so hard.
Lay off Gunnar, Cash. It's not his fault.
He didn't suggest to play tug-of-war with a clothesline.
You want to blame somebody, blame your uncle Al.
Okay, Kellers, I'm back
and I'm armed with french fries.
Huh? Any takers?
We can't eat, Al.
We're just about to get our fingers reattached.
Okay, uh... anybody cold?
I-I can find blankets.
Stop, Al! Just stop!
Nobody's hungry or thirsty or wants to run a relay race!
Reunion's over.
Okay, Frankie. I'm gonna need to get some x-rays.
You gonna be okay being away from your family
for a little while?
Yes, please.
Yeah. Okay.
Dr. Hunt says it's good to talk to him, too.
Hey, babe.
I gotta be honest with ya. You've looked better.
Me? Well...
I haven't looked this good since that summer
that we went to the river and I got that stomach bug
and I lost, like, 15 pounds.
You're missing it.
Stop it.
It's not funny.
None of this is funny.
My son is dying.
He's--he's not dying.
We are a long way off from that.
I know that this may look bad, but you--
It should be me.
Hey, Ethie.
Um, why don't we give grandma
a little one-on-one time with pop?
You want to take me for a spin?
I think that's a great idea.
Go on. Give her the nickel tour. All right?
Can I hold him after he's born?
Just for a minute.
Uh, he's gonna need to go right into surgery.
Your baby has hypoplastic left heart syndrome
and an intact atrial septum
that is causing a restriction to blood flow.
He's fine when he's in utero, but once he's out...
the condition is fatal.
Which means he won't be getting enough oxygen.
We'll let you hold him when he's stable,
after his surgery.
Okay, so we'll do the c-section,
and then we'll have 60 minutes to get him to the cath lab
and perform the operation to open his septum.
And if you don't make it in time, he could die?
No, we can do the c-section in the cath lab.
It'll give us more time.
Deliver in one room and operate in the other.
Can you do that?
I don't see why not.
There are about a thousand reasons why not.
You know, people have babies all over the place--
Taxi cabs, high school bathrooms.
If we don't have to waste time
moving the kid from one floor to another,
Why should we?
Because you don't do c-sections in cath labs.
Oh, Karev, back me up.
I'm with Peckwell.
Not my name, but okay.
This whole situation is high risk.
If something goes wrong,
we don't have the tools on hand to deal with it.
Are your tools glued to the floor?
Bring them with you.
Okay, we have an opportunity here
to do something new
and badass.
I mean, don't you want to be the badass
who delivers the kid in a cath lab?
Who does that?
Nobody... but you.
Okay.
Okay, I'm in.
All right. Karev, you with Peckwell?
Myers. Dr. Jason Myers.
Nobody cares. Karev? All right.
Sounds like one nasty tug-of-war.
It was the height of idiocy,
which is saying a lot for my family.
I'm a journalist.
I cover the sophomore beat for my school paper.
And they chose me to edit
the spring supplement this weekend,
But my parents told me
I had to go to this stupid reunion,
that it was more important to pretend
not to hate people I hate.
And now my hand is ruined and my career is over.
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Your hand is going to be just fine.
I will see to that.
Okay? And...
you have lots of time to worry about your career.
Okay?
Okay.
All right. So do you have any questions before we start?
Just one. Someone took my cell phone.
Can I get that back?
Sure. Right after the scan.
And I have a follow-up. What's the C.D.C. doing here?
Okay, we're gonna lie down now.
Good. All right. Try to stay still. Try to stay still.
Thank you.
Okay, beginning with Joyce.
Joyce Basche--I placed an A.V. graft for hemodialysis.
Take me through that.
I made an incision
over the radial artery and basilic vein--
I'm sorry.
I'm going to ask you to go back a little further.
Did you scrub?
Did I scrub?
For how long did you scrub, roughly?
4 minutes, 36 seconds, exactly.
You're sure about that?
I am.
I used "Think," The Aretha Franklin song.
I run it in my head. It's 2 minutes, 18 seconds.
Hospital protocol is a 4-minute scrub,
so I go through it twice.
And the scrub nurse who handed you your instruments--
that was?
Fran. She was right across from me.
Well, now the graft is in place,
and you secure.
I did a standard vascular anastomosis with running prolene.
I checked for leaks. There were none.
And you closed or Dr. Murphy?
Wait. The doppler.
I... confirmed good flow with the doppler.
Then I closed.
And it--it went perfectly.
All right. Anything else you remember?
I remember saying, "That went perfectly."
All right. Let's move on to Seth Lepik.
I got this.
What the hell's going on?
These guys won't tell us anything.
Sir--
I want my son outta here.
I want him transferred to another hospital right now.
I understand. I'll have to tell you,
moving seth now would put him
at greater risk for more complications.
If we're hoping to avoid another surgery--
You're damn right, we are.
You're not touching my son again.
See what you can do to arrange a transfer.
Hey, Myers set up for the c-section in the cath lab.
We need to run through the steps of the procedure.
Look at you. "Myers."
You say it like he isn't nailing your girlfriend.
She's not my girlfriend.
Whatever. You love her.
She's my friend.
You sound stupid when you say that.
She's moving in with the guy.
What am I supposed to do?
Beat him up.
No. I'm gonna try to be nice to him and get along
so I don't lose my friend.
Or you could punch him and take back your girl.
Hi, Frankie.
Hey, have you found my phone yet?
Uh, not yet. So this is Dr. Robbins.
She's gonna assist me in surgery.
Now your hand was pretty badly crushed...
from the trampling,
so it's gonna mean an extensive surgery
to repair these bones here and here
and fixate these.
Oh, my god.
It's gonna be okay, though, right?
I mean, she's gonna be able to, you know, use her hand?
Oh, that's the goal.
Sweetie, I'm gonna go tell your mom you're gonna be okay.
Okay.
Okay.
It's worse than we thought, honey.
All right, so do you have any questions
before we take you up?
No.
Okay.
Actually, I do have one.
Um, the C.D.C. Is investigating Dr. Bailey
because several of her patients died, right?
Uh, um, who told you about Dr. Bailey?
I asked an orderly. Oh, shoot.
I mean, I can't reveal my sources.
But you just confirmed it for me,
so you can be my second source.
Oh, no, I didn't.
That's Dr. Robbins?
What are you doing?
Checking Bailey's post-ops.
I thought Richard was taking care of Bailey's patients.
Just Seth Lepik, the infected guy. I took the rest.
Bailey's patients are all turning up with staph.
You're pregnant. Why take the risk?
Because I'm looking out for bailey.
And I'm trying to look out for you.
This is why I need Cristina in the room.
What room?
The delivery room.
Wait. What?
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.
On-call room, you and me?
Oh, I wish.
Uh, but I have an atrial septostomy with Karev.
Oh. But after I save a baby's life,
I'm gonna need to celebrate.
Okay. Well, find me.
Oh. How, uh, is the grandma?
Uh, she's sweet, but useless.
Rachel's doing better, though, so at least Ethan's got her.
Mm. Paul's gonna wake up.
I've been doing serial neuro exams.
I have a good feeling.
Spoken like a true scientist.
Mmm. Thank you.
Thank you for having a good feeling.
Anytime.
Oh, Mer asked me to be at her birth
and watch her poop on a table.
You have to do that.
Can't I just show up after
when everyone has control of their bowels?
Watching a baby be born is like seeing god in person.
Spoken like a true scientist.
I used scissors to shorten the graft to fit.
Took about a centimeter off.
I remember Mr. Lepik had deep vessels.
Um, so I asked Fran for more retraction.
I'm sorry. Fran?
You named Linda
as your scrub nurse on Mr. Lepik's surgery.
Yes. Yes, right. Sorry.
Then I finished the graft, and I closed.
Well, what about the leak?
According to Mr. Lepik's chart,
there was a small leak on the venous side.
Yes. Lepik.
Yes. Uh, he had a leak.
Um, and I put in an interrupted stitch.
You remember that?
Yes, I remember.
I irrigated with antibiotic solution
to avoid infection, then I closed.
You closed? That's important.
I did. I closed.
You're sure? Because your--
Did you put the cap on the toothpaste?
Sorry?
I assumed you brushed your teeth this morning.
So did you put the cap back on the toothpaste or didn't you?
Or can you be sure?
Because when you do a thing every single day--
Dr. Bailey, we're talking about the lives of two people.
What, you don't think I know that? D-don't insult me.
These are my patients who died.
You think I don't know that far, far better than you?
So again, uh, are you sure you closed?
Can I take a break, please?
There's only a little more to, uh...
do.
Hey. Is your interview over?
We're... on a break. Wait. Wait.
Aren't you supposed to be avoiding me like the plague?
Come on. What can I do to help?
Anything?
I just want to know how Seth Lepik is.
I'd like to see his chart,
But they locked me out of the system.
Dr. Grey.
She wants to check on her patients.
What do you think she's gonna do, alter their charts?
That's what the C.D.C. is gonna think, yes.
Well, maybe you called them too soon.
I am thinking of the bigger picture here.
She's part of that picture.
We need to stand by our doctors.
Even if she's at fault? We stand by her then?
She's not.
But we should cross that bridge when we get to it.
We're kind of at that bridge.
Uh, excuse me, uh, Dr. Avery?
Yes.
Sorry to bug you, but I was just kind of wondering,
is there, uh,
any update on my family...
or their fingers?
Mom? Mom!
Somebody help my mom! Mom?
What's wrong? What's going on? She needs some help.
Uh, ma'am?
Hey, what's your mom's name?
Rachel.
Dr. Bailey, step away from the patient, now.
Okay, let's clear the wheelchair and the tables.
I got it.
Make room.
Okay, lay her down. All right. All right.
Call a code.
Mom!
Page Dr. Shepherd, stat.
Yes, doctor. Okay.
Okay, Amelie, here we go.
Scalpel.
It's gonna be okay, honey.
But what if it's not?
Shh.
No! Stop.
I can't do this.
Not right now.
His heart is okay now.
And you all know that when he comes out,
It's going to stop working.
I'm not ready for him to die.
Amelie, honey--
No. Look at me. Look in my eyes.
You have to do this.
Your baby's life depends on it,
and you are wasting time.
We're all here.
We're all doing our best to save your baby's life.
Breathe with me.
Okay. One more time. One more time.
You can do this.
Right?
Right.
She's ready.
Just confirm what I have so far.
There's some kind of an infection
going on in the hospital linked to Dr. Bailey.
You don't even have to say anything.
You can just nod if I'm close.
Let it go, Woodward.
Who's woodward?
Uh, you should know that.
You should give me back my phone.
You're denying my second amendment right.
Wait. You want a gun now?
Duh. First. I meant first amendment, obviously.
Look, there's this girl named K.K.
who wrote an article about some bird
that everyone thought was extinct but living in her backyard.
It got picked up by the A.P.,
and now she's a stringer for the "Times."
This is a real story.
I mean, I have an opportunity here to be awesome.
Why don't you count backwards from ten?
Mm-hmm. Okay?
Ten...
Nine...
You're obstructing the free press.
What's after nine?
Eight...
Seven...
What are we gonna do when she wakes up,
Roll her up in a rug and stick her in the trunk of a car?
Is he okay? Is he alive?
He's beautiful.
Thank you.
I got him.
Please save my baby!
Let's move, people.
Coming through! Clear the way!
Shepherd?
Her pupil's blown. She's re-hemorrhaged.
I need to get her to an O.R.
What the hell happened?
I'll let you know when I know.
Okay, let's go.
Check her breath.
I'll see you up there.
She's gonna be okay.
We've got her and we're gonna take care of you.
Hey, hey. Room 10-24.
She's gonna take you to your grandma.
Wait for me there.
Come on. This way.
What is it?
He's dropped his pressure.
I can't hear breath sounds on the right.
Okay, run fluids wide open.
Get me a chest tube tray, fast.
Right away, doctor.
In the vena cava.
What is the oxygen saturation?
35.
Inside the right atrium.
Nobody move. Nobody breathe.
Oh, Seth.
Oh, dear god.
Chest tube, now. Hold on.
Perforating the septum.
Why isn't the blood going through?
Because I'm not through. Just give me a minute.
Now I'm through.
Man, I'm good.
So my mom's dead?
Yes.
But Dr. Shepherd said she was getting better this morning.
Yes, but there was something going on in her brain that was...
sudden
and couldn't be prevented.
There was no way of knowing that this was going to happen.
Mm. Could it have been the ice cream?
Like a brain freeze?
No. No.
Ethan...
There was nothing anyone could have done to have stopped this.
Well... I need to go now to my grandma.
She needs someone to hold her hand.
I'm so sorry.
All right, Deedee and Jane's surgeries both went very well.
Ohh. They'll be in recovery soon.
Cash is still in surgery,
And Dr. Torres is in with Frankie now.
Her fractures were complicated, but hopefully, with therapy,
she'll regain full use of her hand.
Therapy?
How much therapy?
Well, that's hard to say now, Tony.
But it could be anywhere from six months to a year.
You hear that?
A year of physical therapy, Al.
And then she might get full use back. Might.
Let's look at the bright side now--
The bright side? Everyone is mangled.
Well, not Frankie.
She got lucky.
She's still got all her digits, tone.
Her hand was crushed!
I know. I-I-it's horrible. I-I know it. And...
And I'm sorry, but, hey, well,
Well... we're all here for you.
And, uh... that's why we're a family, right...
for stuff like this?
Hey. Come on, huh?
Mr. Keller.
Let me get a look here. You all right?
I think I broke my hand.
He's not stabilizing.
He needs surgery immediately.
No, not in this cesspool.
An ambulance is coming for him.
No, he's too unstable to transfer.
I'm canceling all--
You guys have some infection running rampant.
It's not safe.
It's not the hospital. It's one doctor.
The infection came from one doctor and one doctor alone.
She's been isolated,
and the infection has been contained.
I've been tested. I'm clean.
The O.R. has been tested. It's clean.
If we don't go right now, your son's gonna die.
Do what you have to.
Save my son.
You cleared to scrub in?
Yes, sir. They cleared me this morning.
Okay, prep him.
So Bailey did do something wrong.
Of course not.
I only said that to get their kid into surgery,
And if you repeat it, I'll have your ass fired
before you finish talking, you understand?
Baby's looking good.
Heart function's hypokinetic but improving.
Yang says that's to be expected.
That yang's a piece of work.
Yeah. Well, try living with her.
Listen, man, I appreciate your work today.
I think this thing with Jo got us off on a bad foot.
She cares a lot about you.
We're friends. That's all.
All right.
All right.
I had a messed-up childhood, too.
I was a foster kid like her. It was crappy.
But I didn't have it near as bad as Jo did.
I was never homeless, never had to live in my car.
But she's, uh, really turned it around for herself.
And I just, uh...
I want the best for her, that's all.
Yeah, okay.
Yeah. Thanks for today.
Every year, it keeps on getting
harder and harder to plan these things
and to get everyone to come.
Why do it? Doesn't seem like they appreciate it much.
They're all that I have.
I almost got married a few times,
but I always messed it up.
My family is Tony and Jane and Deedee and Cash and...
everybody else out there.
And I'm just meant to be, uh...
annoying uncle Al.
Well, you'll think of something for next year.
I mean, you just gotta...
just gotta keep trying.
Do I have the Staph strain?
I'd like to start again with Seth Lepik, please.
I made a small transverse incision,
minimal blood loss.
I deepened the incision into the subcutaneous tissue,
asked for retraction.
B.P. was good. All vitals were good.
B.P.'s 90 over 60 and falling.
More laps.
There you go.
Suction.
You tested me for staph.
Can I get those results, please?
There was a leak on the venous side?
There was a leak on the venous side,
A-a l-little blood loss.
But very little.
Now just can you get me my results, please?
Come on. More. More. Pile 'em in.
Yes, doctor.
Look, I gotta try and find it. Hold on.
More suction.
Just again, I'd like you to take me through--
Okay, I can take you through my scrub technique
and how I hold my instruments.
But the only thing you need to know
is do I have this staph infection?
You should know that by now.
More lap pads. More.
Okay, more suction. Right there.
Come on.
Other doctors have been cleared.
So why am I going through this?
Just go down there and get my results.
You have my results?
You have my results,
And I...
have this strain of staph?
Did I do this?
I did...
Didn't I?
I'll be there in the room...
when Fetus arrives.
You will?
Yeah. You're gonna want me there.
Okay.
You're gonna poop on the table, though.
And I'm gonna have to see it,
And then I can never unsee it.
You know what's worse
than you seeing me poop on the table?
What?
Me knowing you've seen me poop on the table.
So you'll suffer more than me.
Yes!
Oh, okay. That makes me feel better.
Hey. Hey.
I'm sorry. I heard about Paul's wife.
Oh, yeah. I appreciate that.
Are you angry with me?
No.
No. I just, uh...
I'm angry at the situation.
Okay, well, you know, after this,
let's just go home, and then I can make some dinner--
No, I'm gonna stay.
I'm gonna stay just in case Paul's condition changes
or if the kid needs...
You know, I just...
I just don't feel like I can leave,
you know?
I mean...
What would you do?
I would go home,
because I'm his doctor, not his family.
Yeah.
I'm gonna stay.
Okay. I understand.
Come to see your boyfriend's miracle baby?
Why did you tell him that?
What?
That I'm a homeless dumpster diver.
I don't tell anyone. You don't tell people about me.
You told me--
Yeah, it's called a secret, Alex.
It's what friends tell each other.
Look, what's the deal? What did he say?
Why'd I tell you? So stupid.
What is the point of a new start
if there's always some dumbass dragging you back down?
Whoa, whoa. Listen--
No, you listen.
You don't tell people about me.
You don't talk about me or to me, ever.
Our investigation has determined the presence
of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus usa600.
Bailey--
Oh, Dr. Bailey, you should not be here right now.
This is about me.
I'd like to hear it.
That's your call.
We have a protocol for a reason.
Okay, we vote.
She stays.
Staph aureus usa600
is an antibiotic-resistant infection
with a range of symptoms
from simple skin rashes
to fatal sepsis.
We have traced the source of the infection to one doctor.
Dr. Miranda Bailey.
is a carrier of MRSA USA600.
But the real culprit here is the gloves.
Records show the surgical gloves
in use at the time of outbreak, March 15,
shipped from the manufacturer Hemming Synthetics, incorporated.
We switched
to Hemming's gloves when pegasus was here.
Our testing reveals manufacturing defects.
Microscopic tears in the gloves, which facilitated
the transmission of staph usa600
to Dr. Bailey's patients.
It is the C.D.C.'s determination,
were it not for the defective gloves,
the patients in question would not have been infected.
As for Dr. Bailey,
we recommend eradication measures
before she can go back to any kind of patient care.
All right.
Thank god.
Best possible outcome.
Here are copies of our report.
The C.D.C. thanks you for your time and cooperation.
And please feel free to call my office
if you have any questions.
Thank you.
What's this?
It's a press release.
We're putting it out in the morning,
which means you have 12 hours to scoop the "Times"
or the A.P. or whatever.
Be awesome.
Wait. I have a question.
One.
And I have a follow-up.
Turns out Bailey's not at fault. Defective gloves.
I heard. That's great.
You know what?
I spent my entire day getting treated like the bad guy.
I'm not gonna do this with you anymore.
You want to feel guilty about what we did?
Go ahead.
Just leave me out of it.
I didn't force you to do anything.
I'm sorry that you're hurt. Okay?
I'm sorry that Matthew broke up with you.
As far as us sleeping together,
I'm never gonna be sorry about that.
April?
Anyway...
Good night.
I'm sorry.
What? No. No, no. I-I am sorry.
You--you have nothing to be sorry about.
No, you made a mistake,
and you asked for a do-over.
Well, I made a mistake, too.
I was hurt and I acted like an idiot.
I-I was hoping, um...
you could forgive me,
that I could have a do-over.
Yes.
It could have happened to any one of us, Bailey.
We'll get you treated, get you cleared--
I killed two patients.
You didn't know.
You scrubbed properly, you gloved--
How's Seth Lepik?
I lost him.
The infection formed an abscess that...
eroded into his innominate vein.
I'm so sorry.
Bailey, how can I--
No! Now you want to help me?
Where were you when my patient was alive,
when I could've helped him?
You shut me out. You left me.
Bailey, I was trying to protect you. That's all.
I'm-- no, no, the hospital.
You were trying to protect the hospital.
It's all that matters to you.
And I don't know why I'm so surprised.
Adele complained about that every time I saw her.
And I protected you.
I-I made excuses to her for you.
I stood by you
Bailey
No, you were a drunk.
You were operating on your patients drunk,
and I stood by you.
I expected the same from you.
I deserved it. I earned it.
But all you cared about...
No.
You...
are not who I thought you were.
But I am going to be in there.
I know.
You'll be looking into my eyes
And holding my hand and feeding me ice chips,
And that's just where I want you, just there.
Mm. Cristina can run interference
and handle the bossy nurses,
and if I decide I want drugs--
Fine. Whatever you want.
Or if I poop on the table...
If you what?
All that time you spent convincing yourself
the sleeping monster wasn't real...
Yeah.
It was gathering strength.
Oh, crap. It's you.
The infection was spreading.
What's the matter?
You were right... about Jo.
Of course I was.
What did I say again?
Forget it.
Oh, Al-Alex.
I'm such an idiot.
I love her.
What?
Just...
You're weird.
Give it a minute.
It's just...
She just...
But I always screw myself out of everything good.
I think I'm losing Owen.
What?
Not today, but...
Soon.
The monster's awake now.
