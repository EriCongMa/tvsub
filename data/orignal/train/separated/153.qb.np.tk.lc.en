yeah , i @-@ i just ... i don &apos;t feel well .
i just wanted to come by and say hi .
i &apos;ll see you at school tomorrow .
school ? so i guess she &apos;s back for good .
didn &apos;t you know she was coming ?
of course i did .
i just ... wanted it to be a surprise .
word is that s. bailed on b . &apos; s party in under 90 seconds
and didn &apos;t even have one limoncello .
has our bad girl reallygone good ?
or is it all just part of the act ?
young lady , you can &apos;t be here .
visiting hours are over .
i &apos;m family .
he &apos;s my brother .
why &apos;d she leave ?
why &apos;d she return ?
send me all the deets .
and who am i ?
that &apos;s one secret i &apos;ll never tell ...
the only one .
x.o.x.o. , gossip girl .
and who am i
that &apos;s one secret i &apos;ll never tell ...
you know you love me
serena ?
serena ?
hey , how are you ?
you know ...
i &apos;ve been better .
eric , i know i &apos;ve been a terrible sister ...
oh , i &apos;m just so happy to see you .
must be a lot of rumors
why you &apos;re back .
yeah , but none of them mention you .
just like mom wants , huh ?
what do i want , baby ?
for serena to sleep in her own bed ,
possibly wearing pajamas .
morning , mom .
hey , i was just about to ask the doctor
if i could take eric to breakfast .
wanna come ?
um ... no .
i think what i &apos;ll do is go get him a croissant down the street .
serena , don &apos;t .
let me guess ...
you told everyone
eric &apos;s just visiting grandpa in rhode island .
your aunt carol in miami .
so you &apos;re actually hiding him ?
he tries to take his own life ,
and you &apos;re worried
it &apos;s gonna cost you &quot; mom the year &quot; ?
serena ,
you &apos;ve been gone , doing who knows what with god knows who ...
i told you , boarding school was not like that .
then you know what ? as happy as i am to have you home ,
you have no idea what it &apos;s been like .
guess whose dad is cool ?
it &apos;s a trick question .
yeah , &apos; cause it can &apos;t be ours .
ha ha , ha ha. look at this .
&quot; top ten forgotten bands of the &apos; 90s . &quot;
yeah , check out who &apos;s number nine .
he &apos;s very proud. mm @-@ hmm .
hey ! hey , way to be forgotten .
but that &apos;s how you get remembered .
maybe you &apos;d care if dad &apos;s band was on &quot; gossip girl . &quot;
what ?
i don &apos;t read &quot; gossip girl . &quot;
that &apos;s ... that &apos;s for chicks .
so that wasn &apos;t your laptop open to it last night
reading all about serena van der woodsen ?
&quot; rolling stone &quot; ? wow .
let me take a look at this again , dad.tr鑣cool.
lincoln hawk ... number nine .
hey , what are you working on ?
it &apos;s called the kiss on the lips party .
everyone &apos;s going .
you were invited to that ?
well , no offense if i sound surprised
since l have never been invited .
one of the girls in my art class
saw my calligraphy ,
and she said that if i addressed all the invitations
that i could have one .
sounds very fair. the sweatshops could learn a thing or two .
dad , this is not a platform for one of your anticapitalist rants .
yes , it is .
besides , you make us go to private school .
that &apos;s for your education .
so we should just be anonymous losers who eat lunch alone
and never get invited to parties ?
works for me .
mom thinks it &apos;s a good idea .
and her judgment is always sound , right ?
jenny , you wanna go to that party , you should go .
you kids could use some fun .
nate ?
uh , your mom told me you guys were staying here at the palace .
yeah , uh , we &apos;re renovating again .
you know my mom ...
if it &apos;s not broke , break it .
so what are you doing here ?
oh , i just wanted to see how you were .
you seemed kind of upset last night .
i- i gotta get going and change for school .
i &apos;m gonna be late .
serena ... no. no .
but you &apos;re back now ...
i didn &apos;t come back for you .
look , blair &apos;s my best friend ,
and you &apos;re her boyfriend ,
and she loves you .
that &apos;s the way things are supposed to be .
hey , watch where you &apos;re going !
serena looked effing hot last night .
there &apos;s something wrong with that level of perfection .
it needs to be violated .
you are deeply disturbed .
and yet , you know i &apos;m right .
you &apos;re telling me if you had the chance ...
i have a girlfriend .
you guys have been dating since kindergarten
and you haven &apos;t sealed the deal .
who says , &quot; seal the deal &quot; ?
come on .
are you following us or something ?
no , i @-@ i go to your school .
identical uniforms ?
is that kind of a tip @-@ off ?
that &apos;s funny .
so you guys wanna sit together at lunch ?
so cute !
these should be framed or something .
not bad work .
and here &apos;s yours , as promised .
thanks .
here you guys are .
i looked all over the dining hall for you .
oh , hi , i &apos;m serena .
i know.i mean ,
hi , i &apos;m jenny .
so ...
when &apos;s the party ?
saturday .
and ...
you &apos;re kinda not invited ...
since until 12 hours ago ,
everyone thought you were at boarding school .
now we &apos;re full ,
and , uh , jenny used up all the invites .
um , actually ...
you can go now .
sorry .
no , that &apos;s okay .
i got a lot of stuff to do anyway .
well , we should get going then .
unless you want us to wait for you .
looks like you got a lot of yogurt left .
no , go ahead .
blair , think we could meet tonight ?
i &apos;d love to ,
but i &apos;m doing something with nate tonight .
the palace . 8 : 00 ?
nate will wait .
spotted on the steps of the met ...
an s. and b. power struggle .
i could probably do a half @-@ hour .
did s. think she could waltz home ,
and things would be just like they were ?
thanks for making the time .
you &apos;re my best friend .
did b. think s.would go down without a fight ?
or can these two hotties work it t ?
there &apos;s nothing gossip girl likes more than a good catfight ,
and this cou be a classic .
uh , you know ... you know , dad ,
there &apos;s this thing called my space where
you can post all this information online .
save some trees. have a blog .
maybe if musicians got off their blogs
and picked up their guitars ,
the music business would be in better shape .
spoken like a true relic .
thanks , son .
help , emergency , 712.5th ave
hey , dad , listen , um , i gotta run .
are you gonna be okay ?
yeah. yeah , your mom will be back .
she &apos;s always been a free spirit .
that &apos;s one of the reasons i fell for her in the first place .
i meant with the fliers .
luckily , staple guns are old school .
go . i &apos;m gonna be fine .
i talked to the nurse , and i &apos;m kidnapping you .
we &apos;re going shopping , aren &apos;t we ?
we &apos;re going to bendel &apos;s ,
just for an hour , though , i swear .
i had a really bad day .
really ? &apos; cause i had a great day ...
a couple of pills , bunch of rorschach tests .
they had this green jell @-@ o for lunch .
mmm ! why didn &apos;t you save me any ?
come on , let &apos;s go .
we gotta get you out of here before mom shows up .
jenny , what is it ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
do you like this on me ?
wait ... wait a second .
is that why you need me ?
i thought this was an emergency .
a fashion emergency .
i mean come on , i &apos;ve never been to a big dance before .
neither have i .
yeah , but mom &apos;s gone ,
and dad &apos;s allergic to department stores .
well , you look good , jen .
you do , really .
thanks .
i mean , too bad it &apos;s more than our rent ,
but i think i can sew something like it .
oh , my gosh , it &apos;s serena .
hi , serena !
hey. jenny , right ?
yeah , hi , this is my ...
stylist and personal shopper eric. hi .
hi. hi .
um , this is my brother .
um , so is ... is that your dress for the kiss on the lips party ?
sort of .
speaking of that , um , here .
i made you one during free period ,
but if anyone asks where you got it , i know nothing .
thanks .
dan ? dan ?
jenny ?
that dress would look even better in black .
black. cool. thanks .
this is some good stuff .
yeah , i &apos;m gonna need it .
blair &apos;s mom &apos;s at the country house .
yeah ? well , then maybe i should swipe some of my dad &apos;s viagra ...
or my mom &apos;s paxil ?
nathaniel , you &apos;re finally about to have sex with your girlfriend .
it &apos;s like you &apos;re headed to your execution .
no , man , i &apos;m good .
talk to chuck , buddy .
you and blair have been dating forever .
all of a sudden there &apos;s a problem ?
there &apos;s no problem .
it &apos;s just ...
do you ever feel like our whole lives
have been planned out for us ,
that we &apos;re just gonna end up like our parents ?
man , that &apos;s a dark thought .
and aren &apos;t we entitled to choose ,
just to be happy ?
look , easy , socrates .
what we &apos;re entitled to is a trust fund ,
maybe a house in the hamptons ,
a prescription drug problem .
but happiness does not seem to be on the menu ,
so smoke up
and seal the deal with blair ,
cause you &apos;re also entitled to tap that ass .
so how &apos;s your mom doing
with the divorce and everything ?
great .
so my dad left her for another man .
she lost 15 pounds , got an eye lift .
it &apos;s been good for her .
i &apos;m really sorry .
yeah , i could tell ,
since you didn &apos;t call or write the entire time it was happening .
no , i @-@ i know , i was just ...
boarding school is like ...
i don &apos;t even know why you went to boarding school to being with .
do you know how it felt calling your house when
you didn &apos;t show up at school and having your mom say ,
&quot; serena didn &apos;t tell you that she moved to connecticut ? &quot;
i just ...
i- i had to go . i just ...
i need to get away from everything .
please , just trust me .
how can i trust you
when i feel like i don &apos;t even know you ?
let &apos;s fix that .
i saw you at school with ... with katy and is ,
and i @-@ i get it .
i- i don &apos;t want to take any of that away from you ...
because it &apos;s just yours to take if you want it .
no , that ... that &apos;s not what i mean. i ...
i miss you .
i just want things to go back to the way they used to be ...
you know , walking to school together ,
dancing on tables at bungalow ,
night swimming at your mom &apos;s country house .
you were like my sister .
you know , and with our families ...
we need each other .
you missed some classic eleanor waldorf meltdowns .
if it wasn &apos;t such a tragedy , it would &apos;ve been funny .
actually , it kind of was .
hmm , well , i wish i could &apos;ve been there .
you are now .
i have to meet nate .
kinda have something special planned .
well , i don &apos;t want to keep you , but , um ...
i love you , b .
i love you , too , s .
spotted at the palace hotel ...
s. and b .
having a heart @-@ to @-@ heart .
hmm , why so thirsty , s . ?
you may have won over b. for now ,
but we still think you &apos;re hiding something .
ah , the invisible man returns .
you know , i really had no idea you could move that fast .
yeah , well , uh , your fashion emergency was solved ,
so i figured my work was done .
come on , dan .
serena said hi to you at a ninth grade birthday party ,
and you &apos;ve never forgotten it .
how could i ?
she was the only person who spoke to me .
and i &apos;m pretty sure she thought i was someone else .
you know , she &apos;s actually nice .
and if she did know you ,
i think she &apos;d really like you .
i don &apos;t know . i think she might be a tad overwhelmed
by the glitz and the glamour of the humphrey lifestyle .
well , i heard she &apos;s living at the palace hotel ...
well , my ... my point exactly .
probably sitting at the bar by herself ,
sipping martinis , all alone .
you know , it &apos;s actually kind of sad .
oh , and , um , dad &apos;s at the gallery working late .
he , uh , left money for dinner ,
so i was thinking indian .
you know ... you know what ?
i think i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m gonna go out .
okay .
good , &apos; cause i already ordered and only got enough for one .
move , please .
i love this town .
i &apos;m going to have to tell my parents
the hotel they just bought is serving minors .
and if you get a drink ,
they &apos;re also serving pigs .
i love it when you talk dirty .
you just love when a girl talks to you .
actually , i prefer them when they &apos;re not talking .
mm , i &apos;ve missed your witty banter .
let &apos;s catch up ,
take our clothes off , stare at each other .
how about i just get a bite to eat ?
i &apos;ve been drinking on an empty stomach .
i heard you didn &apos;t do that anymore .
special occasion .
well , how about a grilled cheese with truffleil ?
you do love truffles .
enough to know it &apos;s not on the menu .
good thing i &apos;m connected .
only &apos; cause i &apos;m hungry .
is it too much ?
i want it to be special .
what &apos;s wrong ?
look , i don &apos;t know how to say this ...
or if it &apos;s even the right thing to do ,
but , um ...
there &apos;s something i need to tell you .
alfonso , you &apos;re a stud .
now , uh , have a good night .
we &apos;re closing the kitchen early .
oh , my god .
this is so good .
well , if you &apos;re looking for a way to thank me ,
i &apos;ve got a couple ideas .
it &apos;s a sandwich , chuck .
this is ...
this is not happening right now .
you worried nate &apos;ll find out ?
what ?
last year ...
the shepherd wedding .
you think i don &apos;t know why you left town ?
come on , hurry up .
you know we &apos;re not supposed to be in here .
oh , if the happy couple didn &apos;t want to put up the cash for the premium bar ,
they should have made their wedding b.y.o.b.
no ! let me see it .
no , make me .
i can do it . i can do it .
no , you can &apos;t. let me just show you .
here , come here. let me see it .
i can do it. stop .
that never happens to me .
it &apos;s okay.you &apos;re still a man in my eyes .
come here .
look at you. you &apos;re a mess .
so are you .
but ... that was it .
you guys kissed .
best friend and the boyfriend .
that &apos;s pretty classy , s .
i think you &apos;re more like me than you &apos;d admit .
no .
no , that ... that was then .
i ... i &apos;m trying to change .
i liked you better before .
chuck , stop it. stop .
no ! chuck , stop it !
i knew it !
i always knew there was something ! get out !
chuck ! no !
get off of me !
i &apos;m so sorry .
are ... are you okay ?
and just when b. and s. had built a bridge ,
it all had to come crashing down .
but dry your eyes .
the kiss on the lips party is around the corner .
and you know who loves parties ?
gossip girl .
nice try , son .
maybe next time .
you seem upbeat this morning .
did you have fun with blair last night ?
actually , we got into a pretty big fight .
oh , you want my advice ? apologize
even if it was her fault .
flowers , maybe some jewelry if she &apos;s really upset .
always works for your mom .
i don &apos;t know . i think it might be for the best .
wait a minute.you guys broke up ?
yeah , i guess we did .
blair is a great girl .
i know . i &apos;m just not sure if she &apos;s the girl for me .
and you guys have been dating since kindergarten .
so i keep hearing .
well , you love her , don &apos;t you ?
yes , i do .
i just think it might be good for us to take a break , you know ?
maybe not right now .
eleanor waldorf is gearing up to take her company public ,
and i &apos;ve been courting her for months
to let me handle the deal .
then you should get it .
i will get it. if you could just help me out a little bit ...
what ?
you love her. she loves you .
it &apos;s just a rough patch , that &apos;s all .
you don &apos;t give up just because things are hard ,
not in business ,
or if your family is depending on you .
how do you know it was miss van der woodsen &apos;s if you didn &apos;t read it ?
and if you &apos;re not a guest at the hotel ,
what were you doing here ?
what ?
uh , look , when prince charming found cinderella &apos;s slipper ,
they didn &apos;t accuse him of having a foot fetish .
uh , and you &apos;re prince charming ?
well , there &apos;s miss van der woodsen now. no , no !
uh , serena ?
no , no , no , no , no.what are you doing ? don &apos;t .
hey , um , do you know this young man ?
she doesn &apos;t know me .
nobody knows me .
it &apos;s cool. it &apos;s fine .
uh ... from last night .
are you ...
um , i &apos;m sorry about that .
you remember me ?
she remembers me .
well , he claims he found your cell phone .
oh ! you found it .
hey , mom .
guess what i got for you ...
a dress for kiss on the lips .
i saw the invitation on the nightstand .
oh , uh , i &apos;m not going to that .
what do you mean ?
blair &apos;s throwing it .
yeah , um , see the problem is , um ,
by ... by the time i got the invitation ,
i , um , actually already had plans .
plans with whom ?
my friend .
uh ... yeah , hi .
uh , nice to meet you , mrs. van der woodsen .
i &apos;m dan humphrey .
what are you and dan humphrey doing ?
we ...
uh , uh , we &apos;re ... we &apos;re going to a concert tonight .
lincoln hawk ?
yeah , &quot; rolling stone &quot; named them
one of the top ten forgotten bands the &apos; 90s .
whoo ! i &apos;m a huge fan .
well , this party would &apos;ve been
the perfect opportunity for you to announce your return ,
but i guess i &apos;ll just , uh , keep the dress for myself .
thank you .
yeah , no , uh ...
it &apos;s not a problem , really .
so you &apos;ll pick me up at 8 : 00 ?
you &apos;d really go out with some guy you don &apos;t know ?
well , you can &apos;t be worse than the guys idoknow .
thanks for meeting me .
look , blair , i- i really hurt you ,
and i know that , and i wanna fix it .
really ? and how are you gonna do that ?
i &apos;m gonna put everything in the past .
i &apos;m not gonna see serena again
or even talk to her .
it &apos;ll be like she doesn &apos;t exist .
i think that &apos;s a good idea .
let &apos;s not mention it again .
you gonna eat that ?
that &apos;s it ?
cause you were pretty upset last night .
i mean , should we talk about this ?
there &apos;s nothing to talk about .
i overreacted .
if you say it &apos;s in the past ,
it &apos;s in the past .
i &apos;m sure you have no feelings for her anymore .
i just feel bad for serena .
she &apos;ll really miss you .
what time does the limo come ?
8 : 00 .
perfect .
lily .
are you shopping for some art to match your furniture ?
why is my daughter going to one of your concerts ?
cause we &apos;re awesome .
with your son .
dan scored a date with serena ?
well , our kids were bound to meet.it &apos;s a small island .
are you sure it &apos;s not some ploy ,
your using my daughter to get to me now that your wife left you ?
how do you know about alison ?
like you said ... small island .
oh , i get it .
you hear about alison ,
use your daughter as an excuse to start something .
yeah .
in your dreams .
well , youarein my dreams , lily , and one in particular recurs ...
it involves finding you in the back of a nine inch nails bus
with your shoes in your earrings and trent reznor ...
that happened .
no need to rehash details of decades past .
so i moved on ...
yeah , from trent to layne to perry ,
till you switched up rock stars
for billionaires .
you think you &apos;re so cute ...
washed @-@ up band , crappy so @-@ called art gallery .
well , not all of us
have settlements from multiple divorces to sustain us .
just stay out of my life , rufus .
you &apos;re going out with serena ,
and i &apos;m going to kiss on the lips .
who said this family wasn &apos;t cool ?
well , listen , i don &apos;t want to be late , but good luck , all right ?
same .
see you at the concert , right , dad ?
uh ... okay .
oh , my god .
my daughter &apos;s a woman .
dad , you could just tell me i look nice
instead of turning this into a sermon on the passage of time .
you look like ...
your mother .
thanks .
blair , let me see how it looks .
why are you wearing that one ?
didn &apos;t you see the dress i left on the bed ?
i like this one .
this one is not as elegant a choice as that one .
why do you care so much ?
because i love you .
blair
you will never be more beautiful or thin or happy than you are right now .
i just want you to make the most of it .
i guess i have time to change .
and put some product in your hair. the ends are dry .
who &apos;s the newbie ?
jenny humphrey .
she &apos;s a freshman .
i love freshmen .
they &apos;re so ...
fresh ?
anything about her on &quot; gossip girl &quot; ?
no .
hmm , until you &apos;re done with her .

i know. um , i mean ...
hi , i &apos;m ... i &apos;m jenny .
it &apos;s , uh , it &apos;s nice to meet you .
you , too .
thank you .
looks like little j. might end up with a new boy
and a ticket to the inner circle .
or will c.end up with another victim ?
i told you i love parties .
so i &apos;m little overdressed , aren &apos;t i ?
honestly
i don &apos;t really have a problem with your appearance .
hey , come on . i want you to meet one of the guys in the band .
oh , so you &apos;re a groupie ?
well , not quite .
serena , i &apos;d like you to meet rufus humphrey .

oh , uh , i don &apos;t know how i know that .
nice to meet you .
