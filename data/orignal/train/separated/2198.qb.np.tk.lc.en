take it all , men !
leave nothing behind !
good evening , my dear fellow .
would you be kind enough
to escort my men and i to the palace ?
what is the meaning of this ?
this , my good king ,
is going to be remembered in your delightful commonwealth .
for tonight ,
you will be host to the most brutal of scoundrels
the seven seas has ever encountered .
guard him .
take your time , gents .
plenty of swag for everyone .
that &apos;s a smart look , chum .
your order , if you don &apos;t mind .
ah , me lady . what is that delightful fragrance ?
it &apos;s called a bath .
you should try it sometime .
pardon me for being so bold .
now , then , can i trouble you for the keys to the treasury ?
inside that vault was almost $ 3 million
in gold , silver and currency ,
and we took it all .
that night ,
the royal palace , the treasury
and all the large island companies
were systematically plundered .
we were a dying breed ,
the last remaining corsairs on the seven seas .
but the island of oahu would be our greatest pillage .
aloha ahiahi . ladies and gentlemen ,
my beautiful cousin kono has given me the duty
and makana of being your entertainment for tonight .
but first i &apos;d like you all to give it up for the bride and groom .
here they are for the very first time .
mr. and mrs. noshimuri .
excuse me , ma &apos;am . so what happened ?
gabriel pulled a gun on me in the parking lot .
i &apos;ve changed my mind .
no longer planning on leaving .
it &apos;s only a matter of time
before you and your friends get in my way again .
so i &apos;ve come to offer you a deal .
really ?
50 % of his growing drug empire
seems like a pretty generous offer .
so what &apos;d you say ?
i told him he &apos;d better pull the trigger ,
because if he didn &apos;t , i would find him and put him down .
okay , wait a minute .
this guy comes at you at your cousin &apos;s wedding ,
he knows we &apos;re all here .
this is not about a bribe .
he &apos;s trying to send us a message .
yeah , and the message is saying he ain &apos;t scared of us .
guys , look , i don &apos;t mean to downplay how serious this was ,
but ... let &apos;s remember why we &apos;re here
you know what ? you &apos;re absolutely right .
yes , she is . this is kono and adam &apos;s night--
we should be celebrating with them .
well , in that case , i better go find her majesty
and get my dance on .
i &apos;m gonna dance with grace .
what about you , sailor ?
you still got it ?
oh , yeah , i still got it .
you still got it ?
let &apos;s go , hotshot .

mrs. grover ?

yeah , we &apos;re going .

i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m a little weak in the knees right now .
oh , yeah ?
yeah .

hey , cuz , come on , let me see those moves .
absolutely .
hello .
no , i &apos;m awake .
yeah , i &apos;ll be right there .
that was some night .
yeah , it was pretty epic .
i was kind of hoping you and i
could talk a little bit this morning .
we will .
go . go . i &apos;ll be here when you get back .
vic &apos;s name is keanu carson .
40 years old , lives alone .
what else do we know about this guy , duke ?
no record . neighbors say he was friendly .
he had a girlfriend , isabelle lono .
we &apos;re trying to track her down .
also , he wrote books .
airport fiction .
whoa , look at this .
what is it ?
videocassettes .
when was the last time you saw one of these ?
i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s all homemade stuff .
except there &apos;s one missing .
1975年10月 第二卷 共四卷
byron washburn interview . october 1975 .
danny , look at that .
all right , so mr. carson here is watching
byron washburn interview from 1975 .
maybe the killer takes the tape with him when he leaves .
right after he puts a bullet in this guy .
but who &apos;s byron washburn ?
i don &apos;t know .
maybe this guy is writing a airport novel about him .
if that &apos;s the case , it looks like there &apos;s somebody out there
who doesn &apos;t want that story told .
all right , open up .
you made this ?
don &apos;t look so surprised .
well , you &apos;ve always had help .
well , that &apos;s about to change .
i meant what i said , adam .
none of this matters .
i only want you .
so come here .
it &apos;s getting cold .
try it .
you keep cooking like this , i &apos;ll be fat in no time .
i think i like you fat .
what are you saying ?
i am saying
someday
i &apos;d like to have a family with you .
mrs. noshimuri .
i think i like that .
mr. kalakaua .
ok . i am supposed to take your last name . is that it ? here .
i &apos;ve gotta do it .
be right back .
just a sec .
delivery . mr. and mrs. noshimuri .
alright . what a gift .
adam .
adam .
so , csu processed keanu carson &apos;s house .
it was clean , but we did manage to get a lead on the name
from the missing vhs tape .
byron washburn , right ?
beta .
excuse me ?
that is a box for a betamax tape , not vhs .
vhs is actually eight percent larger than betas .
incidentally , they were inferior in every way .
beta had better picture , better sound .
but for some reason ,
the format never caught on with the general public .
is that a conspiracy , too ?
no .
just a basic format war .
not everything &apos;s a conspiracy .
i like you . why is he here ?
oh , with kono off on her honeymoon ,
i asked jerry to pitch in .
think we &apos;re gonna need all the help we can get on this one .
glad to have you , jer .
you &apos;re welcome .
okay , so , can we , uh ... can we get back to washburn ?
so , the guy &apos;s name appears
on a publisher &apos;s press release from back in 1975 .
seems a local history teacher named dr. nathan exley
was writing a book about a band of pirates operating
in the pacific during the early 1880s ,
and washburn was the last surviving member of the crew .
still had pirates in the 1880s ?
actually , you know , i remember hearing about these guys .
when i was a kid ,
my uncle used to tell me a bedtime story
about this crew launching a midnight raid on o &apos;ahu .
legend has it that they laid siege to the island for hours
before escaping with a treasure worth millions .
it &apos;s a fine haul , gents .
fine haul indeed .
of course that &apos;s just folklore .
hardly anyone believes that they actually were here .
but back in the day ,
these pirates actually did hit dozens of islands ,
and they amassed a huge treasure .
the press release also says
that nathan exley conducted a series of video interviews
with washburn , who at the time was 104 years old .
most of this treasure wasn &apos;t recovered ,
so it &apos;s safe to assume a lot of it &apos;s still out there .
maybe washburn , on this tape ,
said something that could lead to the rest of it .
okay , well , that would definitely be information worth killing for .
all right , so let &apos;s just talk to exley
and see what washburn told him .
unfortunately , we can &apos;t .
why not ?
because dead men tell no tales .
would you stop with the thing ?
i &apos;m sorry . it was right there .
oh , hold on a second . exley &apos;s dead ?
presumably .
he vanished right after he started
working on his book 40 years ago .
meanwhile , all of his research ,
including the washburn tapes ,
ended up in a storage container ,
where it remained untouched for years .
now , exley &apos;s family kept paying the tab for that container ,
hoping he might come back someday .
he never did .
eventually they gave up ,
and then , just a few weeks ago ,
that container ended up being sold at an auction .
and that &apos;s where the vic comes in .
keanu bought that container ,
and we think it &apos;s because
he was writing a book on dr. nathan exley .
whatever info that pirate shared with exley ,
chances are he told somebody else .
so let &apos;s find out whatever we can ,
reach out any known family members , see if they know something .
some party last night .
epic . epic party .
you know , me and catherine-- we passed out
as soon as we walked in the door .
i woke up in my tux .
so , i take it that means you did not have the talk ?
what talk ?
what talk ? what are you ... ?
the talk . we talked about the talk .
remember ? &quot; how long you staying ? what are your plans ?
what &apos;s going on with you and i ? &quot; the talk .
oh , the talk .
yeah .
yeah . no , we didn &apos;t have the talk .
i didn &apos;t get around to it .
‭ well , if you &apos;d like me to cyrano that conversation , i can do that .
you know , you just tell me when and where , and i &apos;ll be there .
thank you . it &apos;s fine . i got this .
we &apos;ll , uh ... we &apos;ll have the talk .
you know , if you &apos;re scared , i can understand that .
it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s okay to be scared . you can admit that to me .
why would i admit that when i &apos;m not scared ? i &apos;m not scared .
you &apos;re not ?
no .
no , &apos; cause i understand that you &apos;re a navy seal ,
and being fragile is not something you are allowed to be ,
being a navy seal , so , you know ,
if she hurt you once pretty good , i imagine ,
she ... well , she might do it again . that &apos;s understandable .
hey , listen to me for a second .
listen , i appreciate your advice .
i know you &apos;re trying to do me a favor ,
but could you please , please just stop talking ?
that &apos;s all , just ... you know ?
okay .
you want to be alone ,
you want to be miserable for the rest of your life ,
don &apos;t listen to me .
you are alone and you are always miserable ,
and @-@ and that is exactly why i &apos;m not listening to you , okay ?
and that &apos;s also why i &apos;m gonna ask catherine to marry me .
say that again .
i said you &apos;re always miserable .
the other part !
i &apos;m gonna ask catherine to marry me .
well , it is about time .
i agree with you .
it &apos;s , uh , something i should have done a long time ago .
i am very proud of you , buddy .
thank you .
this is fantastic , huh ?
look at this . see this ?
this is me not miserable .
i am happy right now for you .
give it time . it &apos;ll pass , i &apos;m sure .
hey , buddy , that &apos;s great !
hey , hey , i &apos;m driving here . what , are you crazy ? !
yeah , it &apos;s good .
i &apos;m picking the tuxes .
fine .
stop it !
nice of you to join us .
let him go .
please .
he &apos;s done nothing to you .
what do you want from him ? !
she &apos;s a little late to the party .
you catch her up ?
gabriel wants me to transfer all my assets
to a holding company he controls .
shouldn &apos;t be difficult , right ?
he was scheduled to transfer
all that cash to his father &apos;s ex @-@ partner in three days .
i &apos;m just asking him to move that money now .
if he does that , the yakuza will kill him .
if he doesn &apos;t , what do you think i &apos;ll do ?
doctor , when was the last time you spoke to your boyfriend ?
a few days ago .
keanu was in research mode ,
gearing up to write his new book .
whenever he started something new ,
it was best just to leave him be .
you know , keanu very recently-- he bought a , um ...
a storage container , uh ,
belonged to a guy named nathan exley .
do you know anything about that ?
of course . that &apos;s who keanu was writing about .
the container had all of exley &apos;s research--
papers , tapes ,
his whole life &apos;s work , really .
he was like this real @-@ life indiana jones .
i told keanu i thought exley may have
gone off in search of pirate treasure .
i figured he probably died in the field
or maybe at the hands of a competitor .
keanu was intrigued .
thought there was a story there .
so when that container became available ,
keanu jumped at it .
ma &apos;am , there were some videotapes
in the container among exley &apos;s work , one of which
had an interview with a man named byron washburn .
did keanu ever mention anything about that ?
yeah , but he didn &apos;t say what was on it .
he was really excited about it , though .
ah , he even left me a message after he watched it .
baby , it &apos;s me .
you were right about this professor .
i don &apos;t care if this book sells or not .
we &apos;re gonna be rich .
thank you .
okay , from the sound of that voice mail ,
keanu got hit with the same treasure @-@ hunting bug as exley .
right , which means that old sea dog washburn had to have said
something about a missing fortune .
clues , maybe a location even .
all right , look , buddy , i do not know what &apos;s strange , okay ?
somewhere out there there &apos;s a 130 @-@ year @-@ old pirate treasure
that we &apos;re looking for ,
or that the key to finding it
is on a 40 @-@ year @-@ old betamax tape .
whatever the case may be ,
whoever &apos;s after that treasure is willing to kill for it now .
ladies and gentlemen , we &apos;ve had
a report of a gas leak .
please use any available exit .
let &apos;s go .
hold it right there !
put the painting down .
place your hands on your head .
that &apos;s right , keep your hands where i can see them .
back off now .
chin , what have we got ?
hostage situation .
somebody calls in a phony gas leak .
they tried to evacuate the building .
all of a sudden , one of the security guards says
this guy wearing a gas company uniform
trying to steal a painting .
must be a very valuable painting .
well , it belonged to king kalakaua , so it &apos;s priceless .
you know , i &apos;m starting to think
this was about more than just an art theft , though .
what do you mean ?
remember that
bedtime story i was telling you that my uncle told me ?
sure .
in it , the pirates storm &apos; iolani palace .
and they steal anything of value ,
including a painting of manoa valley .
now the painting our perp tried to steal ?
also of manoa valley .
now , according to the museum director ,
this particular painting disappeared from the palace in 1884,
and it only resurfaced 40 years ago
in the basement of an old church .
so you &apos;re saying it could be the same painting .
i thought you said that your uncle &apos;s story was just a legend .
what if it isn &apos;t ?
look , whatever it is , here &apos;s the bottom line .
we got a killer looking for some 19th century treasure .
then , all of a sudden ,
somebody tries to rip off a painting
that may or may not be connected to the same treasure ?
this ain &apos;t a coincidence .
our homicide and this attempted theft are connected .
all right , we had any communication with the perp ?
nothing so far .
tac up . we &apos;re going in .
clear .
clear .
‭ clear .
clear .
clear .
clear .
clear .
clear .
so , where is this guy ?
all right , this level has three possible exfil points .
maybe he grabbed his hostage
and slipped out before backup arrived .
yeah , but that doesn &apos;t make any sense .
he already got away with the painting .
what the hell you gonna take a hostage for ?
this is good .
what is it ?
it &apos;s quiche .
tastes like eggs .
what do you say ?
what you &apos;re asking me to do is not possible .
i told you that .
adam , i &apos;m trying to be professional about this .
there &apos;s absolutely no need for anybody else to get hurt .
now , all you have to do
is give my friend damon here the account codes .
we &apos;ll do the rest .
no .
adam .
it &apos;s for me .
pulled security footage from the heist
and ran our thief through facial rec .
didn &apos;t get any hits on the guy .
but we did get one back on his hostage .
hostage ?
more like a co @-@ conspirator .
the girl &apos;s in on it .
guys , meet miss cindy patterson .
she lives in key west .
she &apos;s got a nice little record for boat theft and armed robbery ,
and , according to the paper the fbi has on her ,
she likes to run with an unidentified accomplice
who just so happens to fit the same description as our guy .
okay . so patterson hides out in the museum somewhere
while her partner jacks the painting .
the security guard catches him in the act ,
so she calls an audible and pretends to be an innocent bystander .
i did it again .
what &apos;d you do ?
i think i blew this case wide open .
excuse me .
well , are you gonna tell us what you did
or are you gonna break your arm ,
patting yourself on the back ?
your stolen painting is a treasure map .
i &apos;m almost sure of it . check this out .
here &apos;s the painting as it looked when it hung in the palace ,
shortly before it disappeared .
and here is how it looked
when it was recovered 40 years ago .
note ...
the tear in the canvas .
now , if you believe the pirate raid actually happened--
and i think we &apos;re all on board with that now--
then this damage occurred
while the painting was in the hands of the crew .
obviously , it could have been an accident ,
but there is also another possibility :
the pirates did this on purpose .
see , i &apos;m thinking ,
after they pillaged oahu , something happened
which forced &apos; em to hide the treasure here on the island .
maybe the army was after them . who knows ?
i think they stashed the treasure
with the intention of coming back for it later .
except they didn &apos;t have time to draw a treasure map ,
so instead they made this painting the map .
see , all they had to do
was pick a spot in the painting ,
bury the treasure there , and then mark the canvas .
it &apos;s pretty nifty , right ?
it &apos;s a total pirate move .
this is like waiting in line
for a star wars movie for you , huh ?
yeah . kind of .
anyway , taking into consideration ,
a century &apos;s worth of foliage growth and terrain shifts ,
i &apos;ve managed to pinpoint the location of the treasure .
there . just east of lua &apos;alaea falls .
that &apos;s where your booty is .
ergo , that &apos;s where your bad guys are headed .
you do realize that this theory of yours is completely ...
ridiculous .
damn right .
jerry , if the painting is the map ,
why not just go to the museum , pull out your phone ,
take a picture of the damn painting ?
got a point , jerry .
your ignorance is adorable .
what ?
you &apos;re thinking of these perps as thieves .
they &apos;re not thieves .
they steal boats and chase treasure .
they &apos;re pirates .
and pirates pillage as they go .
it &apos;s what they do .
&quot; take it all . leave nothing behind . &quot;
that &apos;s their mantra .
this painting belonged to king kalakaua himself .
it &apos;s priceless . there &apos;s no way they &apos;d leave that behind .
guys , have i ever steered you wrong before ?
trust me . thar be treasure in that spot .
are we there yet ?
well , according to jerry , it should be right over this ridge .
i &apos;m just gonna keep it real , man .
if these perps are up here ,
i &apos;m gonna be way too damn tired to arrest &apos; em .
we could just shoot the guy when we get there .
steve , you &apos;re good with that , right ?
yeah , you children done complaining yet or what ?
anybody got any bug spray ?
i &apos;m getting eaten alive out here .
speaking about being eaten alive ,
steve has something that he would like to share
with everybody , with the group .
i hope it &apos;s bug spray .
danny . come on . really ?
you should share it . he &apos;s getting married .
what ?
yes , i was gonna propose to catherine ,
unless , of course , big mouth here
already blew the surprise .
well , that &apos;s great news .
yeah , mazel tov , brother .
thank you .
when &apos;s the big day ?
i don &apos;t know . i got to ...
i got to get a ring
and find a location . but soon .
look , i asked rachel to marry me with a soda can ring .
i think we all remember how that worked out .
hey , listen , she was , uh , very surprised .
it was very romantic .
i bet it was .
it &apos;s a nice story , danny ,
but i want to do this right , you know ?
it &apos;s been a long time coming , so ...
you know , not that yours wasn &apos;t right , but ...
well , if you &apos;re gonna do it , do it right .
i appreciate it .
guys , over here !
all right ,
i &apos;ll guard the entrance .
seriously ?
claustrophobia does not go away .
good luck , guys .
over here .
yeah , he &apos;s definitely been here a while .
you guys , looks like we just solved
the mysterious disappearance of professor exley .
hey , guys . check this out .
according to axley &apos;s journal , the pirate captain was afraid
there was gonna be a mutiny when they got out to sea .
he figured he needed some leverage ,
so he had the quartermaster
and the first mate help him hide the treasure
before they raised anchor .
all right , so the captain double @-@ crossed his crew
before they could double @-@ cross him .
okay , gentlemen . i have completed my field examination .
what you got ?
there were no signs of foul play .
and based on the damage to the skull
and the positions of the remains inside the cave ,
it appears that our intrepid professor took a bad fall
and sustained a fatal head injury .
so his death was an accident ?
i &apos;m afraid so .
i guess we should try to reach out to the exley family .
if we can , give &apos; em some closure ,
if nothing else .
well , the techs have mapped
every inch of that cave and the surrounding area .
there &apos;s no sign of buried treasure .
well , maybe they moved the treasure before he got here .
nope .
csu said that nothing in the area
has been excavated . ever .
all right . well , then exley and jerry
both got the location wrong .
yeah , but according to exley &apos;s journal ,
the treasure &apos;s still on the island .
which means the killers are still here .
yo . boss man . want a slice ?
i got pineapple @-@ pepperoni .
a bit luke , still tasty .
no , i don &apos;t . thank you . um , jerry ,
i don &apos;t mean to be rude ,
but do you have to work in my office ,
at my desk ... with my stuff ?
not if you gave me an office .
okay . i &apos;ll consider it .
how about that ?
okay .
but don &apos;t take too long . i do have options .
noted .
do you have something for me in all this ?
hey , you know the old saying
that the coconut doesn &apos;t fall far from the tree ?
i &apos;m pretty sure it &apos;s &quot; apple , &quot; but go on .
okay , whatever .
but that woman you &apos;re looking for , cindy patterson ,
it turns out that not only is she a modern @-@ day pirate ,
she &apos;s the descendant of one .
what are you talking about ?
her mother &apos;s maiden name was washburn .
as in ...
as in byron washburn .
she had it legally changed to patterson
before cindy was born .
chin .
probably to distance herself
from the legacy of a murderous pirate .
this is good .
what &apos;s up ?
all right , check it out . cindy patterson
is washburn &apos;s great @-@ granddaughter .
apple doesn &apos;t fall far from the tree .
exactly what i said .
okay , so carson buys exley &apos;s research at auction ,
discovers the washburn interview ,
and contacts the man &apos;s family to offer them a look ,
which is what a nice guy would do .
he makes this call before he learns
about the buried treasure ,
at which point he &apos;s already put himself in danger .
doesn &apos;t this blow your mind ?
your suspect is a 21st century anne bonny .
how cool is that ?
except for the part where she kills a guy .
yeah , except that part .
and i did some background
on cindy patterson &apos;s great @-@ granddad .
it turns out that he was on staff here at the palace
for a few years in the &apos; 40s , but he got canned .
what for ?
not sure .
i &apos;m gonna do some digging in some old employee records ,
see what i can find out . but ...
i &apos;m thinking folks discovered that he had been a pirate .
hey , guys , i got something . come on .
‭ good work , jerry .
so , i just got off with tsa .
they told me that cindy patterson flew here
two days ago on a one @-@ way ticket from florida .
she was traveling with this guy .
notice any resemblance ?
same guy .
simon moore &apos;s his name .
what do we know about him ?
not much .
but i checked with his credit card companies .
as soon as he got into town , he rented a 40 @-@ foot sailboat .
that boat &apos;s got to be how they &apos;re planning
to get the treasure off the island .
getting answers out of you two is like pulling teeth .
i &apos;m sorry .
that was in poor taste .
this can end .
all you got to do is give me the passcodes .
no .
no , don &apos;t do it !
your bride , she &apos;s one tough lady .
something to say ?
okay ! okay , you win .
i &apos;ll give you what you want .
just don &apos;t touch her again .
no , don &apos;t do it !
your turn .
no , adam , no .
give damon the codes .
adam , no .
the codes are useless .
i made specific instructions with my bank .
the transfer can only be initiated in person .
adam ,
if you &apos;re lying to me ...
she &apos;s gonna die .
very slowly .
and i &apos;m gonna make you watch .
you understand ?
yeah .
i understand .
clear .
clear .
clear .
maybe they haven &apos;t recovered the treasure yet .
or they have and they &apos;re moving it some other way .
chin , what &apos;s that ?
so much for it being priceless .
they ripped the frame off this thing .
there must have been something inside .
could &apos;ve been some clue on the canvas
or maybe one of the borders .
all right , this painting told them something .
we need to figure out what that is .
sorry for the wait , mr. noshimuri ,
but the transfer &apos;s now complete .
kono .
everybody get down !
it &apos;s okay , it &apos;s okay .
call an ambulance !
please , he needs help .
somebody call an ambulance !
so what exactly are we supposed to be looking for ?
i don &apos;t know . jerry ?
this is everything from the boat ?
yeah , why ?
geez .
how &apos;d i miss this ? this frame &apos;s wrong .
what are you talking about ?
take a look . see ?
different frames .
when the painting was originally stolen ,
the frame was brass . this is wood .
okay , so the pirates changed it .
but why would they go through the trouble ?
i think the key to finding this treasure isn &apos;t the painting .
it &apos;s the frame .
chin , i need a picture of the painting .
same size as the real thing .
what are you doing , jer ?
take a look-- there &apos;s a notch
on the back of each piece .
he &apos;s right .
now pay attention .
each corner represents a direction .
north , east , south , west .
so who &apos;s gonna say it ?
you should say it .
&quot; x &quot; marks the spot .
we &apos;re almost done .
simon .
simon , i found it .
simon .
simon ?
cover !
that &apos;s it , isn &apos;t it ?
those better be solid gold .
they &apos;re not .
i thought you said this stuff was worth millions .
man , i can go down to aloha pawn ,
buy everything in here and the case
and still get change back from a 20 .
that &apos;s the legend .
you know , maybe the captain buried this as a decoy .
the real treasure could still be out there .
yeah , well , if it is ,
a lot of people lost their lives for nothing .
let me guess--
you found some silverware and a couple candlesticks .
yeah , how &apos;d you know that ?
went through the palace archive ,
found washburn &apos;s old employee record .
the dude was fired from the gig
because he was suspected of stealing
some silverware and a couple candlesticks .
i &apos;m shocked .
i &apos;m not really shocked , jerry , the guy was a pirate .
no , he wasn &apos;t . that &apos;s the crazy part .
according to this , washburn was born in 1882 .
which means he lied about his age to exley .
when those pirates were doing their thing ,
washburn was still in diapers .
so washburn lied about being a pirate .
whole thing was a giant hoax .
well , hell , the guy did work at the palace .
i &apos;m sure he had some insider knowledge
as to the history of the place .
probably figured he could use that plus the pirate legend ,
make himself some cash .
everyone fell for it .
exley , keanu , us .
his own great- granddaughter .
what are you doing , calling me on your honeymoon ?
you okay ?
what are they saying ?
um , uh , nothing , yet . he &apos;s still in surgery .
but even if he pulls through ,
gabriel got away with the money
that was meant to buy his freedom from the yakuza .
without it , we &apos;re both dead .
