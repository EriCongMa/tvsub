What are you doing back?
We can't go over this again.
Go home. Get some sleep.
It is so weird watching your mother try to rebound.
Well, taking care of her appearance is a good sign, actually.
She's flirting with everything that moves.
Did she tell you why Cavanaugh broke it off?
No.
I wish she'd talk about it.
Do you know the average woman ingests 7 pounds of lipstick
over a lifetime?
Why do you insist on telling me
your disgusting fun facts over food?
It's coffee.
Hiya, doll!
Hi!
Detective.
Of all the knuckleheads she's gonna flirt with --
She has to flirt with Lightning McQueen?
I thought his name was detective Gibson.
I believe he's part of the auto-theft task force.
That explains why he's so arrogant.
Watch this. Watch.
If you were a car,
you'd be a '68 Dodge charger --
Sleek styling, great street performance.
Hey, detective.
I was, uh, I was just telling your mother
about this, uh, '68 dodge charger we recovered.
Really?
I thought you were about to compliment her on her trunk space.
Jane!
Good morning, lieutenant.
What's good about it?
So...rich, I guess you'll have your usual.
Angela, how can you know me so well?
Now she's trying to make Cavanaugh jealous?
Jealousy can sometimes be a sign of love or commitment.
It can also be a sign that Lightning McQueen
is about to get his ass kicked.
So, I'll be seeing you, beautiful.
Okay. Bye, rich.
I will call you.
Okay.
Hey, Mrs. Rizzoli, if you're not too busy,
can I get some coffee over here?
Right away, lieutenant.
I can't watch any more.
We have to do something.
What? Hide all the plastic knives?
Vanilla.
Just who I was looking for.
I thought you wanted some coffee.
Uh, never mind.
Hello, Mr. Rondo. Who do we have here?
Reuben, Dania, Trevor.
It's Dawg.
How do you do, Dawg?
Rondo, aren't we a little old for playdates?
These are all my homies from "Off the street."
The home for teenagers?
I volunteer there.
We're "Rondo's rejects."
Perhaps you'd consider a less pejorative name.
Juveniles often identify with the labels society gives them.
Oh, society didn't name them. They named their own selves.
Um, a reject is a person or thing
dismissed as failing to meet standards -- - Maura.
"Pejorative" is a word
that expresses contempt or disapproval.
Brought 'em by to meet my heroes --
a little impromptu "Career Day."
Wow. So you guys want to be cops?
No. No way.
They just need a little mentoring.
Maybe you could... take 'em around a little?
I-I could be a mentor, too. Does anybody like cooking?
Cooking!
Or science?
Science!
Okay, ma, why don't you give them a doughnut,
and we'll let you be on your way?
Fine by me.
Right? I ain't being mentored by no chick, anyway.
You know, now that I think about it,
we love to mentor here.
And we can find a boy detective, if that's what you'd prefer.
Detective Frost could be your mentor.
And Sergeant Korsak could be your mentor.
If I have to have a mentor,
I'd rather it be someone with an advanced degree.
I have an M.D.
Okay, I guess.
You got anything to eat?
Okay, ma, we got to go. We got a case.
All right, come on. I'll make you all breakfast.
Frankie!
Come here!
I need you to do something.
You got a big case?
You see those teenagers over there?
Run their names -- make sure they haven't killed anybody.
You mean the ones standing 6 inches from ma?
You probably shouldn't let them out of your sight, either.
Where would Luke Skywalker be without Yoda?
Or the Karate Kid without Mr. Miyagi?
Okay, I said I would do it. I'll be a mentor.
Agnodice was the first female gynecologist
in ancient Athens.
She was one of my mentors.
You mean when you time-traveled back to the 1st century?
3rd century B.C.
Marie Curie was also a big influencer of mine.
Who were your mentors?
Uh, Police Woman, Kojak...
Oh! Jim Rockford.
What was he cooking?
Beer.
Beer?
He's a microbrewer. This is his test kitchen.
Victim is Greg Jensen,
C.E.O. and brewmaster of Overlord Ale.
Who found the body?
Jensen's assistant, Ruby Burke.
She found him this morning.
And then I came back, and...
She have an alibi?
Yeah, she was in Scandinavia for the last month.
She was selling her boss's viking-themed beer.
She flew in from Reykjavik this morning.
When was he killed?
He's been dead at least eight hours.
Sweet poster girl.
No kidding.
Uh, gentlemen?
Do we have any suspects?
Oh, victim's married. Wife's been notified.
Says she was home taking care of their two young kids.
We're bringing her in.
2.5-centimeter round hole.
That's a very unusual entrance wound.
What was he stabbed with?
Not a knife.
Are we playing "Process of elimination" again?
Yes.
It's not a garbage disposal,
Cleaver, pitchfork,
pinking shears...
Uh, ladies?
Right.
But this...appears to be a metal rivet.
Maybe it came off the murder weapon.
There's some blood droplets...
...leading into that mill.
I think we just found what's left of our murder weapon.
The trace confirmed that the blood on the stick belonged to Jensen.
You think a sharpened stick could do that kind of damage?
Yeah.
Doesn't explain the metal rivet, though.
Hey. Jane.
Oh, my g-- Frankie, I'm so sorry.
Oh, no problem.
I've been having a barrel of laughs with your mentees.
Who has mentees?
Um...you.
And you.
Apparently, Maura and Jane volunteered all of us --
Toured booking, properties.
I was just about to show them how I write a traffic ticket.
This is snore-ville -- population, you.
They're all yours.
Hey. Hello.
Hi!
Please... don't play with that.
Why you got a doll, man?
I was wondering if I could go see the medical examiner,
Maybe check out an autopsy?
Uh...no.
Why not?
'cause it's not on the itinerary.
I'm taking A.P. Bio, so --
Advanced-placement biology?
Yeah
What, you think a reject kid can't be smart?
At least reject kids don't play with dolls.
Wait. I bet you call him an action figure,
right, bro?
Yes, and if you touch my "Action figure" Again,
I will break your face.
If I could observe an autopsy,
it'd count for extra credit.
Okay, fine.
But you need to have your parents sign
this liability release waiver.
No, Dania, your parents got to --
It's legal. I'm emancipated.
My mom's dead, and my dad's in prison.
If you don't believe me, here are my documents.
Okay. Come on.
W-w-w-w-wait. We want to see dead bodies, too.
Yeah. Better than this bullshit.
Oh, shoot.
I bet you wish you picked the "Chick" Detective now.
Sorry, fellas.
Cover him up.
Cover him up, Maura. Cover him up.
Hi.
You're about to do the "Y" Incision?
Yes!
And do you know why the "Y," Dania?
To facilitate the removal of the breastplate.
Go ahead. Do it.
Uh...no.
Our release form doesn't cover slicing and dicing.
You said I could check out an autopsy.
I didn't say which part.
Okay, so, the first thing that I do
is examine the body.
Does your release form cover gloves?
Yes.
All right. Do you notice anything?
His leg's a little swollen, but I don't see an injury.
You're very observant.
You think it could be deep-vein thrombosis?
I read about this war correspondent
who died from sitting in one place for too long.
Better be careful, Maura.
I think we found your replacement.
Can I see the wound?
What kind of weapon did that?
I'm not sure.
But the ragged wound edges suggest
some kind of a barbed blade.
Detective, can you help me turn him on his side?
Yeah, sure.
Okay.
There we go.
We'll take a closer look with the fluoroscope.
There's something lodged near t-8.
Looks like some kind of spear tip.
It looks like an iron krokspjot.
Aha! Just as I suspected
- a crockpot.
Krokspjots like this were used during the Viking era.
I think these are rune letters carved into the metal.
The runic alphabet is an ancient nordic one
that predates latin.
Can you read what it says?
No. I'll have to consult a runic scholar.
Well, Greg Jensen sold Viking-themed beer.
Maybe the spear tip came from his brewery or his office.
Okay, Frost and Korsak have a lead on a possible suspect.
Come on, Dania.
Cool. Can I watch you intimidate the suspect?
No. But hurry.
I don't want you to miss my mother's cooking class.
Thank your mom for that cooking class.
Dawg and Reuben almost
got slapped upside the head.
Korsak, you were gonna hit your mentees?
Not me -- Frost.
Mr. Chill can't take teen 'tude.
Take a look at this.
That is the overlord ale logo.
But look at this.
Why would a brother want to be in a nordic motorcycle gang?
Ragnarok riders is a motorcycclub.
It's not a gang, Frost.
Well, the motorcycle-club logo is
similar to overlord ale.
Don't tell me our victim lifted a motorcycle club's logo.
It gets worse.
See the sexy Viking poster girl?
Yes.
Meet Sophie West.
Here she is with her daddy.
Clark "Skull Crusher" West --
head of the Ragnarok Riders.
He sued Greg Jensen, claiming copyright infringement.
Yeah, 'cause he couldn't sue for daughter infringement.
Jensen paid Sophie to be the model for Overlord Ale.
Daddy sued over the logo and lost.
The guy's a sore loser.
Hey, you watch yourself, pencil neck.
You watch your back.
This battle isn't over.
Oh, I think we should pay Skull Crusher a visit.
That's not a drill. Nothing's scheduled today.
Get the hell out of here, people!
Let's move -- now!
Go!
I left my mask from Nairobi inside.
I left my lucky notepad.
I should've grabbed my Swiss lithographs.
Look at this building. Do you see any smoke?
No.
And does your super-sniffer nose smell any smoke?
No.
I think one of Rondo's rejects
pulled the fire alarm
to get out of ma's "fun with fresh produce" lecture.
All right, everybody.
Some joker pulled the fire alarm.
Let's get back to work.
Told you -- false alarm.
Frankie!
Ma. What's the matter?
Someone stole my wallet!
Okay, I cashed my paycheck.
I put my wallet in my purse.
I keep my purse underneath the counter, like I always do.
That's not very safe.
Clearly, Maura. Thank you.
You don't think...
Yeah.Do think.
Me too.
I'm gonna go put these masks away.
Okay, put them in the safe.
I don't have a safe.
No one's taking your masks, Maura.
Okay, which one of you snapped the wallet? Hmm?
Look, anyone of you that "found" my mother's wallet,
you return it now, we don't press charges.
You heard Detective Vanilla.
If one of you is the guilty party,
guilty party better speak up.
I didn't steal no wallet.
Me either.
I want a lawyer.
Stand up.
Do it!
Hold your hands out.
Whoever pulled the fire alarm is gonna have U.V. dye residue.
So?
I touched the alarm to turn it off.
Sure you did.
I didn't steal no wallet, all right?
You can't prove nothin'.
No, but we can file a misdemeanor for pulling the alarm.
I-I know it don't seem like it, but they're all good kids.
Dawg has a scholarship to BCU,
and he could lose it if he gets in trouble.
"If"?
Oh, he's in trouble.
You find that wallet, Rondo. Then we'll talk.
I feel bad.
Well, you think 20 minutes with us
is gonna turn their lives around?
Hello. Are you here to support the kids' cancer ride, too?
Uh, Boston Homicide. We're looking for Clark West.
Clark!
What do you want?
We're investigating a homicide.
I wasn't asking you. I was asking the lady.
Clark West.
My friends call me "Skull Crusher."
Can you ride bitch, detective?
No. I'm a terrible passenger.
We're here about a murder.
I'm busy -- getting ready for a charity ride.
Here's your choice -- you can answer our questions
or enjoy a bitch ride in a squad car
back to headquarters.
You got 30 seconds of my attention.
Greg Jensen, the beer maker you sued,
was murdered yesterday.
Well, guy's a prick.
He might have had something like that coming.
We have video of you threatening Greg Jensen at the courthouse.
He stole my club logo,
made my daughter his marketing bitch.
Where were you yesterday?
Yesterday...
Mass General, pediatric cancer center,
bringing toys and books to the kids.
You want to see the photos?
Big Karl here maxed out the camera memory.
Really cute.
It was sad, though.
Good luck with your ride.
Thank you.
I e-mailed a photo of the rune letters on the spear tip
to my old nordic-history professor.
It says "Olaf the boneless."
It's a...recipe for viking soup?
Hmm. Could they have meant "Ivar," I wonder?
Mm. You too?
Well, there was a viking leader named Ivar the boneless.
Some scholars believed that he was a disabled dwarf
who was carried into battle on his shield.
He was a great warrior.
How is a boneless dwarf on a shield a great warrior --
How do you manage to do this?
Do what?
A boneless dwarf --
What was so urgent?
The crime lab found seminal fluid
mixed with vaginal secretions in the victim's tyvek suit.
It appears to be a month old.
"In"?
So our victim had sex about a month ago
and then wore his disposable tyvek suit again?
Yes.
And they also found vaginal secretions on the spear.
Okay, that qualifies as the grossest trace evidence ever.
Relax. The secretions were here.
Probably from transfer.
Also about a month old.
And there was enough cellular material in both to extract DNA.
We're running it.
So our killer could be a woman.
Well, since a weapon this sharp
doesn't need much force, it's possible.
Korsak is interviewing the victim's wife.
I need one of those swabby things.
W-- stop! I'll get you whatever you're looking for.
But I need a more precise description.
I have to figure out what you say all day long.
You can't figure out "Swabby thing"? Really?
Mrs. Jensen, this is detective Rizzoli.
Very sorry for your loss.
Thank you.
Mrs. Jensen was just telling me
that her husband often disappeared for days at a time.
You have any idea where he was going?
He said he was working on a new ale recipe.
But I had my suspicions.
I think he was having an affair.
I'm right, aren't I?
We found a woman's DNA on your husband's clothing.
Was he gone for an extended period of time
about a month ago?
This has been going on for almost a year.
You understand that we'll need to rule you out
as a source of that DNA?
Yeah, of course.
Whatever you guys need.
I found a second phone in my husband's car.
I believe they're called "Burn" Phones.
I wrote the number down.
Maybe that'll help.
Thank you.
What were you thinking detective Frost.
I wasn't thinking, sir.
You sure as hell weren't.
I'm sorry, sir.
What was that all about?
I made hazelnut coffee.
Apparently, he doesn't like hazelnut.
Oh, boy.
Why is cavanaugh in such a lousy mood?
'cause he broke up with my mother.
You're kidding me.
You don't look too surprised.
Uh... your mother confided in me,
and asked me not to say anything.
Well, good. I'm glad she had you to talk to. She was really hurt.
I think she still likes him.
How do you feel about that?
Like it's time to set a good example for Mrs. Buttinsky
and not be detectibuttinsky.
Run this number, will you? It's our victim's burn phone.
Wife seems clean to me.
Me too.
I'm guessing ol' Greg wasn't calling home
on that second phone.
Yeah, he was.
But not the family home.
Our boy had two phones for two addresses.
He was using his secret batphone
to call...
a back bay condo he bought a year ago.
I'm thinking not only was he cheating on his wife,
he had a little love nest.
Let's go toss it.
Boston police! Open the door!
Clear.
I think all that yelling is just this game.
Clear.
Olaf the boneless.
That's the same name
that was on the spear tip that killed him.
Must be Jensen's user name.
Man. He liked playing.
He's logged 2,738 hours.
He has some high-level weapons, too --
Porgeir's ax, thor's hammer.
And a saga shield?
Damn!
You seem to know a lot about this, Frost.
I've dabbled in M.M.O.R.P.G.
Have you?
Massive multiplayer online role-playing games.
This one's called "Vikings of the realm."
Why would you waste 2,700 hours playing a computer game?
Points.
Points for what?
To win!
Win what?!
Okay, so...Greg Jensen
ran a successful microbrewing company,
but he pretended to be "Olaf the boneless" most of the time.
Look at this --
Snail mail, addressed to the victim at a P.O. Box, sent within the last month.
No return address. Can't read it.
Looks like it's written in rune.
Hey, look at this.
"Your whore is next."
I'm thinking our killer isn't done.
I'm just saying it's more cost-effective
to get a quart of frozen yogurt if we're sharing the same flavors.
I like my own, okay?
Well, why don't you like it swirled?
It's still mocha and mint.
No. When you swirl it, it becomes one flavor.
Coffee toothpaste.
Don't get your pepperoni grease on my half.
Okay, get your mushroom off my half.
Did you talk to your mother?
Lieutenant Cavanaugh looked miserable when we left.
Well, maybe because we have an unsolved homicide
with a killer hiding in a video game.
Who's that?
He did not! A lavender vw bug?
God's honest truth -- lavender, for a guy who's...
You feel me?
Who's gonna feel you, detective Gibson?
Detective Rizzoli.
How are you?
Uh...I was just dropping your mother off.
Did you permit this?
Well, I insisted they each have one foot on the floor
when there's heavy petting on your mother's bed.
You're so funny.
Uh, ma, can I talk to you for a sec?
Uh...s-sure.
Oh, hey, I'm just gonna go upstairs.
I think I forgot to charge my electric toothbrush.
Okay, why are you doing this to Lieutenant Cavanaugh?
Okay, Jane, this is so not your business.
Yeah, it is.
Especially when he's taking it out on all of us.
The -- the entire squad.
Well, then he's more juvenile than I thought he was.
You want to hear juvenile?
"If you were a car, you'd be a '68 Dodge Charger."
You don't even like that goofball.
Don't call him that.
And I do, too!
I don't believe you.
And if you are doing this just to get to Cavanaugh,
then I'm gonna say the same thing you told me.
Don't. It's beneath you.
Jane.
Wh-- ma? A-are you crying?
I'm so proud of you.
W-w-why are you crying?
Because I raised you -- I raised a beautiful girl.
And...
...you're right.
Thank you.
I love you, ma.
I love you more.
Thanks, gorgeous.
Detective.
That's a good sign.
At least she's not drawing attention to her mouth.
No sign of flirtation.
I needed a pick-me-up after that porsche fiasco.
You hear about this, Rizzoli?
Everybody's talking about it.
Oh, yeah, everyone's talking about that old "Porsh," Gibson.
It's "Porsh-ah."
Really?
"Gibson" is an italian name?
No.
But some of us know a lot about high-end Italian rides.
It's a German car, you idiot.
I think they're crotch-blocking each other.
"Crotch-blocking"? Really?
It's my old nordic-history professor.
His office says he's almost here.
Mrs. Vanilla.
We found your wallet!
Rondo, thank you!
Oh! Where'd you find it, Rondo?
I knew you guys didn't take it.
Well, we checked the trash. Dania found it in a dumpster.
Is everything there, ma?
Well, my license, my ATM card, my cash --
I'm missing 100 bucks.
Are you sure, Mrs. Vanilla?
Okay, Dawg, let's go. We're going upstairs to booking.
No, Jane, wait. Let me handle this.
How would your mother feel?
She wouldn't be very proud, would she?
Um... Dawg doesn't have a mother.
His mother passed.
Oh, I'm -- I'm sor--
Don't cry.
Don't cry. All right.
He didn't do it.
He's covering for me.
The money's there. I put it back.
Dania, why would you steal from me?
I needed $100 for a textbook.
Well, why didn't you tell the teacher?
I didn't want her to know --
What?
that -- that you live in a teen shelter?
Yeah.
You went to the bathroom.
I took the wallet out of your purse.
Dawg saw you coming,
and he pulled the alarm to cover for me.
I'm really sorry.
I'm sorry, too.
Jane.
This is professor Walter Lowell
from the Department of Scandinavian Studies
at Boston Cambridge University.
Hello. It's nice to meet you.
The pleasure is mine.
Dr. Isles was about to show me some letters
written in the rune alphabet
that you all would like me to translate.
Yes. I have some of the letters here.
We made copies of the originals.
Oh, floppy disks?
Oh, yes, I certainly do remember
when the floppies were the originals.
When you said "old," I didn't realize
that you meant he and Olaf went on Viking raids together.
He's hard of hearing, but he can read lips.
These appear to be written in proto-norse.
That's an Indo-European language spoken in Scandinavia.
It's thought to have evolved
as a Proto-Germanic Northern dialect
over the 1st century A.D..
Please -- one nerd at a time.
Well, these are love letters
addressed to a viking by the name of Olaf the Boneless.
No, that's -- that's historically incorrect.
It's Ivar the Boneless.
I hope he's not charging us by the hour.
Stop.
They were written by Olaf's lover,
a viking maiden by the name of Gunnhild.
Oh, dear.
Olaf was still married to a different viking maiden
by the name of Undirmaor.
You know, "undirmaor" means --
Not now, Maura.
Exactly how deep into this game was he?
Listen to this.
"Your velvety beard still hums
against the bosom of my tender flesh."
Okay. Well, uh, you've been very helpful.
The DNA recovered from the spear is a match
for the DNA found on the victim.
It's from the same woman.
Thank you, Susie.
Okay, well, that's a big break.
Yep.
It was nice to meet you.
Oh, no, no, no, no,
I'm not finished with your letters.
Sit. Sit.
Have some tea.
Have some tea.
"Cold are the counsel of women."
Cold, indeed.
Find anything on the victim's computer?
Nothing useful. He jus used it to play M.M.O.S
No idea how he had a successful business.
I guess playing with geirlaug of gongu
is more fun than making beer.
"Vikings of the realm" Game makers
sent over subscriber information --
12,000 names of people Greg Jensen played with.
I was about to go through them when Jane rescued me.
Where is she?
Trapped with professor windbag.
Undirmaor and...gunnhild?
I can't find under-girl, but I found the other one.
Gunnhild is va-va-va-voom!
Her name is Kendra Dee.
She logs in from her house in south end --
Conveniently located just minutes from us.
I'm not doing anything. I could help you pick her up.
Yes, that's my avatar.
Can't you tell?
Yeah. Quite the resemblance.
Were you having an affair with Greg Jensen?
Oh,was.
It was the most intensely passionate affair of my life.
We made love on the isle of thanet,
Nottingham, york.
Ma'am, was this I.R.L.?
It was enchanting and magical.
Olaf swept me off my feet.
That's not what I asked.
Was it I.R.L.?
It was not.
What's "I.R.L."?
"In real life."
Ma'am, have you seen this before?
No, but I can read rune letters.
It's the name of my lover --
"Olaf the boneless."
Did you write these letters to Greg Jensen?
To olaf.
It's a shame he's dead.
This has to be the work of undirmaor.
She did everything in her power to drive us apart.
Do you know who undirmaor is in the, uh...
the I.R.L.?
No. I do not.
But mark my words -- I will get that woman.
Take my card a-and call me before you do that.
Ma'am.
Ma'am.
Greg Jensen was killed I.R.L.
Yeah. By an R.P.
"Real person."
It's Jane.
We'd like to do a cheek swab for a dna sample.
If you must.
Darn!
Who am I gonna play with now?
Oh, my god.
I thought that professor
would never stop talking about underwear.
Undirmaor has got mad hacking skills.
Keeps changing accounts, deleted her avatar's history.
Well, what do you know? It's gunnhild.
She's cute.
She stopped looking like that in 1963.
She's at a secret gaming event.
I'm invited.
Well, the dna results haven't come back yet.
She could be our killer.
She's says she's about to make contact with undirmaor.
Let's go.
There's porgeir.
And there's thor.
And grettir.
And refur!
"Refur"?
Well, I don't see my date.
Speak your preference, viking kin --
Raiding, looting, pillaging, slaughtering.
Maybe...Erich the blood ax has seen her.
Whoa! Your name, wench?
Detective Rizzoli, Boston homicide.
I'm sorry. W-we're role-playing.
Get it, yeah.
Uh, we're looking for a viking named "Gunnhild."
Sure, yeah -- the babe.
She's in the lower realm.
Come on! You've only got one life left.
And I got to go back to the beginning.
Oh, crap.
Mrs. D! Kendra!
Call for backup. We got to lock this place down.
Hey, you. You! Hey!
I need all units in the area at solly's comic store.
Did you see anyone come in here?
Uh, no, sir. Ma'am. Ma'am.
Make sure nobody leaves this store, all right?
Go on!
She was stabbed with a dagger --
Just like in the game.
Who the hell is undirmaor?
Because that's our killer.
Tell me you have something
'cause we don't have a single witness.,
Well, I found a hair on Kendra's cloak. No root ball.
But we are trying a new forensic laser technique.
It uses ultraviolet light and mass spectrometry.
Faster, please.
Zaps the hair and turns it into a gas.
Explain how that's gonna help me solve two murders.
It may help us determine what the killer ate and drank
over the last year.
How is knowing how many ding dongs our suspect ate helpful?
The mass spectrometer results are back on the hair tests.
I know you've been waiting for them.
Thank you.
Because hair grows slowly over time,
It creates a timeline of sorts.
Okay.
So, what did the killer eat --
Uh, let me see --
for breakfast in April?
That's interesting.
It certainly is.
Strawberry waffles? Eggs benedict?
What?
Fermented minke whale and sheep's head cheese.
Where would you get minke whale
and sheep's head cheese,
assuming you'd want it?
Um...Scandinavia?
Scandinavia.
Maura, what does "Undirmaor" mean?
In English?
No. In Proto-hobbit.
Yes, in English!
"Underling" or "apprentice."
Apprentice.
Or assistant.
Maura, we know someone
who's probably been eating whale or sheep.
Got a warrant. Alibi was bullshit.
The airline just confirmed.
Ruby Burke, Greg Jensen's assistant,
flew standby on an earlier flight from Reykjavik.
Nice, Frost.
Okay. Thanks.
Ruby didn't show up to work today.
She's playing "Vikings of the Realm" somewhere.
So I put a bolo out in the realm?
No. I built an avatar to find her.
Looks just like you.
We got to go in disguise.
I still don't understand the point of this stupid game.
Well, what is so hard about it?
You raid ships, plunder villages,
kill sworn enemies to win.
Win what? A fantasy lover?
Wait a minute.
I don't think this is about winning.
I think this is about love.
You think Greg Jensen was having a real affair with Ruby?
I don't know. It wasn't much of an affair.
There wasn't any evidence of her at his love nest,
and the secretions and the seminal fluid
that we found were a month old.
Unless Jensen had pity sex.
Pity sex?
Yeah, one-time pity sex,
right before he sent Ruby to Scandinavia.
I mean, he froze her out --
in real life and in the game, too.
So, Ruby must have stalked him in the game,
figured out that he had a new virtual lover...
"Gunnhild," a.k.a Kendra Dee.
Frost...
check and see if Olaf is online.
Olaf? But Greg Jensen is dead in the I.R.L.
So explain why Olaf is online in his Back Bay love nest.
Not Olaf -- Undirmaor.
Ruby, put your hands in the air.
Olaf, my love.
Undirmaor. At last -- you're here.
Ru --
She doesn't even know we're here.
Korsak, unplug that thing.
No.
No! Olaf!
Olaf, please come back, my love.
Ruby, it's over.
It's not over.
We were finally together.
Turn it on.
Bring him back.
He's not coming back.
Greg is dead, Ruby.
I loved him.
He loved me.
Did he love Ruby Burke, or did he love Undirmaor?
He loved me.
Me.
Olaf loved Undirmaor, and I thought...
Oh, God, if only, if only he knew that it was me --
Me, Ruby, right there all along...
Did you tell him who you were before or after
you slept with him a month ago?
I gave him my flesh.
And when I told him I was Undirmaor, he just...
He sent me away.
Ruby, you're under arrest for the murder of Greg Jensen.
No! No! Please turn it back on!
And Kendra Dee.
No! No, he's not gone!
No, he's not gone!
He can't be!
He can't be gone!
Aah! Go right to jail!
My turn. I want to buy me some property.
Hope you hid the good silver.
You pretend to be such a badass,
but you're really a pushover.
I'm glad you brought them here.
Why? So you could study aberrant juvenile behavior?
They just need some attention, a little support.
I mean, they've never played a board game.
Can you believe that?
I know.
Maura, how much garlic did you put on this bread?
Six cloves.
Six cl--
They're homeless teenagers. They're not vampires.
What about Dania?
Well, I'm gonna keep an eye on her.
and so were you.
We'll make sure she puts that big brain to good use.
I talked to Cavanaugh.
The mentor program is now official.
I wanted park place!
Oh, too bad,, Mrs. Vanilla.
Hey Vanilla.
Yeah.
I'm a landlord.
I never pictured an evening in with Rondo.
Jane
You don't think your mum might...
I don't want to seem uncharitable, but...
Yeah. I'll make sure that Rondo's reject family
doesn't move into your guest house.
Who's hungry?
I'm starving.
Me too.
Man, this looks good!
It's hot.
No, no, no. Just look, like this.
Okay.
