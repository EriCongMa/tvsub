when we started this thing ,
i was just doing it to kiss your ass
so jessica would forgive me .
but you &apos;re the real deal .
as far as i can tell , jack soloff
is holding up his end of the bargain .
he &apos;s doing more than that .
he just sent out an email nominating you for junior partner .
what ?
i &apos;m not sending out a press release
announcing mike ross of harvard just got promoted .
what is this ?
am i mistaken , or did we not have this discussion ?
don &apos;t call me again .
you need to tell louis you &apos;ve been sleeping with esther .
we slept together one time .
what difference does that make ?
you promised him you wouldn &apos;t do it at all .
i need to tell you something .
you made a promise to me !
i &apos;m telling you .
because he &apos;s so messed up from whatever goddamn thing
happened to him in his pathetic childhood , he can &apos;t--
shut the hell up !
get me jerry myers on the phone .
jerry myers ?
louis , what happened ?
i &apos;ll tell you what happened .
harvey took a goddamn swing at me .
that &apos;s what happened .
oh , my god .
yeah , &quot; oh , my god , &quot; i &apos;m gonna sue the shit out of him .
okay , louis , you &apos;re hurt .
the first thing you need to do is get some ice
and calm down .
did you not just hear me ?
he hit me and then he threw me into a coffee table ,
so i am going to sue the shit out of him !
i don &apos;t think suing harvey is the answer .
of course you don &apos;t , because you want to protect him
like you did when you lied to me
about what he did to esther .
listen to me : i told harvey to tell you himself .
and i lied to you
because i knew something like this would happen
if you didn &apos;t hear it directly from him .
well , it did happen , donna .
now get me jerry myers on the phone .
you want me to do that , i will .
but you &apos;ve always said we &apos;re a family ,
and families keep things like this in the family .
i &apos;m not sure if congratulations are in order ,
but since we have no other choice ,
i &apos;m going to choose congratulations .
you saw the memo ?
i did .
you &apos;re making partner .
no , rachel , i &apos;m not .
what do you mean ?
jessica told me to turn it down .
said it would draw too much attention to me .
that &apos;s crazy .
if you turn it down , you &apos;ll draw even more attention to yourself .
that &apos;s exactly what i told her .
and what did she say ?
she said that if i &apos;m smart enough to be a lawyer
without going to law school , i should be smart enough
to come up with an excuse to turn it down .
oh , that &apos;s bullshit .
you think i don &apos;t want this ?
i do .
but we &apos;ve always known i was never gonna make partner .
okay . what are you gonna do ?
i am gonna do the exact opposite of what i usually do .
instead of trying to prove jessica wrong ,
i &apos;m gonna come up with a legitimate excuse
for why i can &apos;t accept it .
jessica ,
if i knew you were coming over ,
i would have made us some tequila and eggs .
and i would have thrown them in your face .
well , that doesn &apos;t seem very nice .
i cooked them just like you like them .
you think this is funny ?
you assaulted a name partner .
and i &apos;m making jokes because i don &apos;t want to hear it ,
because he got what he deserved .
i don &apos;t care if he deserved a court martial .
that kind of behavior cannot exist in my firm !
you mean our firm ?
if it &apos;s our firm ,
then it &apos;s louis &apos;s firm , too .
okay , you made your point .
i won &apos;t do it again .
you think i came all the way down here
just to give you a speech ?
you &apos;re taking two weeks starting tomorrow .
me going on vacation
isn &apos;t gonna stop louis from coming at me .
yes , it is , because if you set foot
anywhere near the office in the next two weeks ,
i guarantee he will call for a three @-@ month suspension .
then don &apos;t let him .
harvey , there are bylaws in place ,
and the only way to stop him is you being on vacation .
the only problem with that is ,
everyone knows i don &apos;t take vacations .
then why am i holding your request
that you filled out two months ago ?
louis is never going to buy that .
i don &apos;t give a shit whether he buys it or not .
but before you go on your little trip ,
you &apos;re going to go to him with your tail between your legs
and tell him that you were 100 % wrong .
jessica , hey .
what can i do for you ?
well , you can tell me
why you nominated mike ross for junior partner
and didn &apos;t think to run it by me .
it &apos;s an open nomination .
i didn &apos;t think i had to .
i didn &apos;t say you had to .
i asked you why you didn &apos;t .
i don &apos;t understand .
you were the one who forced him to work with me .
i said work with him , not nominate him behind my back
just to stick it to harvey .
jessica , how many times are we gonna have this conversation ?
you gave me a chance to make peace
and i took it .
and i still haven &apos;t heard one good reason
why mike shouldn &apos;t be promoted .
oh , i didn &apos;t say he didn &apos;t deserve to be partner .
then how about i retract my memo
and let harvey nominate him instead ?
unless there &apos;s some reason why you don &apos;t want that either .
because instead of talking to me about this ,
you should be talking to me about what happened last night
between louis and harvey .
how &apos;s it going ?
not great .
you haven &apos;t found a way to turn down the nomination ?
oh , i &apos;ve found 15 ways to turn it down .
but none of them are good enough .
come on , one of them has to be good enough .
rachel , it &apos;s not about the excuse ,
it &apos;s about me being able to look these people in the eye
and convince them that it &apos;s true ,
and i can &apos;t do that .
okay .
what are you gonna do ?
i don &apos;t know .
i do .
you &apos;re doing this .
as managing partner ,
i am officially giving you your first case .
oh my god .
what ?
it &apos;s tradition that the managing partner
to give all new junior partners their first case .
is that what this is ?
yes , it is .
congratulations , mike .
it may not be what i wanted ,
but i really did mean it when i said you deserve it .
thank you , jessica .
i can &apos;t believe that just really happened .
you are the youngest junior partner the firm has ever had .
mike , i &apos;m so proud of you .
well , that means there &apos;s only one thing left to do .
rachel elizabeth zane ,
will you be the associate
on my first case as partner ?
yes . yes .
a thousand times , yes .
i don &apos;t understand .
are you saying you &apos;re sorry you hit louis ?
i &apos;m saying i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t punch him harder .
in that case , i think taking two weeks off
is the best thing right now .
because your emotions
are completely ruling you .
wanting to shut louis up isn &apos;t being ruled by emotions .
it &apos;s being human .
and there are other ways you could have tried to do that .
such as ?
walking out the door , for one .
i &apos;m not walking out of my own office .
why not ?
because when someone points a gun at you ,
you don &apos;t turn around and run away .
you take it out of their hand and you point it right back .
well , sometimes the best way to get someone
to stop firing bullets at you is to take off your armor .
what the hell kind of bullets are you talking about ?
emotional ones .
harvey , louis lashed out at you because he was feeling pain ,
and instead of showing you his hurt , he covered it with anger .
well , that &apos;s his problem , not mine .
actually , i &apos;d say you two have exactly the same problem .
excuse me ?
you did the same thing to him that he did to you .
instead of showing your hurt , you lashed out in anger .
the only difference is , is that you did it with fists .
he did it with words .
are you saying that i should tell him i &apos;m in therapy
and talk about my issues with him
so we can sit around singing kumbayah ?
i &apos;m saying that if you think louis should be sorry
for lashing out at you , the least you can do
is apologize for lashing back at him .
louis . how are you ?
cut the small talk . i &apos;m not interested .
in that case , what can i do for you ?
you can start by telling me how harvey &apos;s being punished .
that &apos;s between me and harvey .
that &apos;s funny .
when he was attacking me , it was between me and harvey ,
and i want to know what you &apos;re gonna do about it .
and i just said , it &apos;s none of your business .
then as managing partner , you should know
that i &apos;m suing your favorite son
for assault and battery .
louis , you haven &apos;t filed that yet ,
so why don &apos;t you tell me what the hell you really want ?
i want harvey suspended .
three months , no pay , no access to clients .
that &apos;s not punishing harvey .
that &apos;s punishing all of us .
well , then i &apos;ll do it myself ,
which i have the right to do under the bylaws .
louis , i was hoping you &apos;d calm down .
but if you still feel this way in two weeks ,
there &apos;s nothing i can do about it .
two weeks ? what the hell are you talking about ?
you haven &apos;t heard . harvey &apos;s on vacation .
bullshit harvey &apos;s on vacation .
harvey doesn &apos;t take vacations .
louis , you wanted him gone , and he &apos;s gone .
and i have his signed requisition right here .
i don &apos;t just want him gone .
i want him humiliated in front of the whole firm ,
not lying on a beach in turks and caicos
laughing at some fraudulent requisition you concocted .
oh , that &apos;s a nasty allegation , louis .
do you have proof ?
you know what , jessica , this is no different than me
putting harvey &apos;s salary in the copy machine .
oh , it &apos;s entirely different , louis .
you did that to rip us apart ,
and i &apos;m doing this to keep us together .
so why don &apos;t you walk the hell out my office
and think very carefully about how you want to play this ?
all right , before they get here , let &apos;s get our facts straight .
easy , our client &apos;s being acquired by google ,
but optela software has a buy option .
claims to have a buy option .
it actually expired six months ago .
then why are we having this meeting ?
because their lawyers don &apos;t know we know that ,
and they &apos;re hoping to get something to go away .
man , i have so much to teach you .
what , are you my boss now ?
oh , how is that different than before ?
i could leave you high and dry right now .
you know that , right ?
shit .
mike , it was a joke .
rachel , i need you to handle this meeting by yourself .
what ? what &apos;s wrong ?
their lawyer just got here .
her ?
she used to work at a nonprofit
when i was a bike messenger , all right ?
we went out a few times .
mike , please . i can handle that--
no , no , no , she knows i didn &apos;t go to law school .
what ?
if she sees me ,
she &apos;s gonna know i &apos;m not a lawyer , all right ?
i need you to handle this meeting .
can you do that ?
no , no , no--mike , please .
you have to give me a second to process what you &apos;re saying .
rachel , i don &apos;t have a second .
i need you to do this .
okay .
okay .
claire bowden .
rachel zane .
shall we get to it ?
yes , definitely .
let &apos;s ... let &apos;s get to it .
first of all , i need to inform you
that we are prepared to move forward with a tro ,
unless , of course , your client has had a change of heart .
you can do that .
i just don &apos;t see any judge granting you a tro
given that your option has expired .
actually , it hasn &apos;t .
this is a record of a phone call
between our client and yours .
a phone call during which
our client agreed to fix bugs in your client &apos;s software
in exchange for a five @-@ year extension
of our purchase option .
i &apos;m confused . do ...
do you actually want to buy our client &apos;s company ?
yes , if there &apos;s a deal happening ,
we want to be included in a meaningful way .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m not authorized to include you in any deal .
then pick up the phone and call your client .
i understand .
you &apos;re not authorized to do that either because a partner
dropped this in your lap in the 11th hour .
you have no idea .
no , i &apos;ve been there before .
but i need something to take to my client .
so , get back to me as soon as you can ?
yes , absolutely .
great .
by the way ,
how old is the partner on this case ?
why would you ask that ?
because i noticed that his name was michael ross ,
and i went out with a mike ross once .
i was just wondering if it was the same guy .
because if it is ,
he really turned his life around .
i ... i &apos;m sure how old he is .
this is the first time we &apos;ve had a case together .
so i--maybe he &apos;s about 45 ?
oh , definitely not him .
sorry .
oh , you don &apos;t have to be sorry .
i was just wondering .
thank you .
yes , of course .
how &apos;d it go ?
not well .
what happened ?
what happened was their buy option didn &apos;t expire
because it turns out we made a deal to extend it .
okay , yeah , that complicates things .
they &apos;re gonna want to squeeze us for more money to go away ,
but it &apos;s not that big a deal .
it &apos;s not that big a deal ?
it &apos;s not that big a deal ?
you practically ran from that conference room
to come and hide in here and left me to deal with a woman
who knows your secret ,
and you &apos;re gonna tell me that it &apos;s not that big a deal .
i meant having to pay off optela is not that big a deal .
you didn &apos;t even tell me how she knows your secret .
she doesn &apos;t know my secret , all right ?
i told her i went to law school ,
and she found out i didn &apos;t .
if she sees me now ,
she &apos;s gonna look into me and then she &apos;ll know it .
and why did you tell her
that you went to law school in the first place ?
rachel , it &apos;s not important .
it &apos;s important to me .
because i wanted to impress her ,
and being a bike messenger wasn &apos;t gonna do it .
so you lied to her to get a date ?
yes , i did .
well , you &apos;re not the only person who &apos;s lied to her now .
what does that mean ?
what it means is , she asked me about you ,
and i had to lie to keep her from thinking
that you &apos;re the same mike ross that she knew before .
rachel , i &apos;m sorry . i ...
where are you going ?
to work on your case .
as for the aforementioned case ,
send our client his practice depo ,
and underline all self @-@ incriminating things
that he &apos;s not supposed to say under oath .
idiot .
moving on to ...
donna , call security .
i do not feel safe in my own office .
donna went home .
i &apos;m here to speak to you alone .
why ? so you can have no witnesses
the next time you attack me ?
no , so i could apologize to you in private .
no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no .
you &apos;re not gonna apologize your way out of this one .
i &apos;m not here to get out of anything .
i &apos;m here to say i &apos;m sorry .
i flew off the handle , and i shouldn &apos;t have punched you .
you didn &apos;t just punch me . you attacked me .
louis--
bullshit .
this is all bullshit .
there is something wrong with you ,
and there is nothing that you could ever possibly say to me--
i have been seeing a psychiatrist .
what ? no , you haven &apos;t .
this is some kind of trick .
i &apos;ve been seeing someone to get help for panic attacks .
you &apos;ve been having panic attacks ?
yes .
where ?
look , i don &apos;t want to get into it .
where ?
in the office .
when ?
they happen when they happen .
louis , i am telling you the truth .
my god . how long have they--
they started a few months ago .
a few--when donna left ?
yes , when donna left .
but it isn &apos;t really about donna .
that was a trigger--at least that &apos;s what they &apos;re telling me .
it goes deeper .
my family ,
my relationships .
let &apos;s just say i &apos;m trying to work through some shit .
so when i said those things , it struck a nerve .
oh , it did more than that , louis .
it hurt .
you hurt me too , harvey .
i know , and i &apos;m sorry .
and it &apos;s not an excuse ,
but i wanted you to know why i did what i did
and where it was coming from .
you &apos;re not really going to turks and caicos , are you ?
i don &apos;t know , but i had therapy this afternoon ,
and i spent the rest of the day
trying to figure out the best way to do this .
louis , i &apos;m sorry for esther .
i &apos;m sorry for lying to you .
and i &apos;m sorry that i attacked you .
i accept your apology , harvey .
thank you , louis .
so you &apos;re not gonna try and suspend me ?
suspend you ?
jessica was sure you &apos;d want to suspend me .
jessica didn &apos;t know that you were gonna say what you said .
as a matter of fact , i know jessica
only sent you on vacation to defuse the situation ,
so i think you should come back tomorrow .
you sure ?
yes .
they &apos;re announcing mike &apos;s partnership ,
and i wouldn &apos;t want you to miss that .
i appreciate that , louis .
it &apos;s the least i can do .
can i talk to you for a second ?
if it &apos;s about you becoming senior partner ,
i think it &apos;s a little premature .
we may have a problem .
may or do ?
the lawyer on the other side of the metadesk case
knows that i didn &apos;t go to law school .
what ?
i saw her come into the office
before the meeting , so i had rachel take over ,
and she &apos;s doesn &apos;t know i &apos;m the same mike ross she knew ,
and she &apos;s not going to , but--
goddamn first case .
jessica , it &apos;s gonna be handled . i promise .
now , rachel and i will work together ,
but she &apos;ll be out front the whole time .
well , i guess we have no choice
but to let her ride it out .
but it &apos;s gonna look pretty damn sketchy
if someone finds out you &apos;ve handed off your first case .
which brings me to my next point .
jack soloff has been asking about it .
then you better make damn sure
you keep him from finding out you put rachel in charge .
because the last thing we need is for jack soloff
to start sniffing around your past .
yeah , i know .
well , if you know all these things ,
then why exactly are you here ?
because you trusted me with being partner
and i &apos;m trying to repay that trust
by keeping you in the loop .
i appreciate that , mike .
but the best way for you to repay me
is by making sure that other lawyer
doesn &apos;t find out your goddamn secret in the first place .
get one of those for me ?
no , i didn &apos;t .
and you can &apos;t take mine like you usually do .
easy , tiger , i &apos;m not here to take your bagel .
i &apos;m here to give you this .
how &apos;d you get that done so fast ?
i know a guy .
you know a guy in custom engraving ?
i know a guy in everything .
oh , thanks , harvey , but you didn &apos;t have to do that .
come on , it &apos;s not every day you make partner ,
and i &apos;ve never known anyone who deserves it as much as you .
except for you .
well , that goes without saying .
so why &apos;d you say it ?
because it had to be said .
seriously , mike ,
you deserve this . i &apos;m glad you got it .
i just wish i could have been the one that made it happen .
i &apos;m just glad you made it in for the meeting
after everything that happened between you and louis .
believe it or not , it was louis who actually
invited me to come back to work .
how &apos;d you manage to get him to do that ?
well , you wouldn &apos;t believe me if i told you .
but even if he hadn &apos;t invited me back ,
an army couldn &apos;t have kept me away from your partnership vote .
come on , harvey , it &apos;s just a formality .
they &apos;ve already given me the title .
it may be just a formality ,
but that meeting &apos;s not happening without my vote on the record .
the next item up for bid on the price is right
is mike ross &apos;s nomination
for junior partner .
now , i know it &apos;s just a formality ,
but what do you say we make it unanimous ?
all those in favor ?
then i &apos;m pleased to announce mike ross
as this firm &apos;s newest junior partner .
so , if no one else has anything--
i have something .
if you &apos;re all wondering why
i have extensive damage to my skull ,
it &apos;s because two nights ago ,
i was viciously attacked by harvey specter .
and since i would rather not go outside the firm
to take legal action , pursuant to section 28 @-@ b of the bylaws ,
i am placing harvey specter on immediate unpaid suspension .
you son of a bitch .
okay , i don &apos;t really know how this works .
should someone call security ?
louis , i don &apos;t think anyone needs to call--
it &apos;s my right .
actually , louis , it &apos;s not .
section 28 @-@ b does require suspension , however ,
it &apos;s enforceable only
after a vote by the partners to determine
if what you &apos;re claiming even happened .
oh , it happened .
i &apos;m not saying it didn &apos;t .
i &apos;m just quoting the bylaws you wrote .
therefore , i &apos;d like to schedule a vote for friday ,
once we &apos;ve all had a chance to review the matter .
okay , this is not what i want--
they &apos;re your bylaws , louis ...
so friday it is .
meeting adjourned .
rachel .
good to see you .
you too .
i have to admit , i &apos;m surprised
you &apos;re getting back to us so soon .
well , once we realized what you really wanted ,
we figured why wait ?
and what is it that we really want ?
let &apos;s be honest .
your client has no real interest
in the fulfillment software business .
no , that &apos;s not actually true--
but you do have an extension of your purchase option ,
which may or may not hold up in court .
so we &apos;re willing to pay you this to go away .
i think maybe you misunderstood me in our last meeting .
i &apos;m not some corporate killer
who &apos;s looking to hold you hostage for a payoff .
my client actually wants to be included in this deal .
claire , this is an incredibly fair offer .
i don &apos;t think this is a fair offer at all .
well , then let &apos;s talk about what would be ,
because your client &apos;s not staying involved in this deal .
is this your boss &apos;s stance or yours ?
it &apos;s our client &apos;s , and my firm &apos;s ,
and i don &apos;t appreciate you questioning
my role in this deal .
look , rachel , i cut you some slack yesterday
because you &apos;re a newbie who &apos;s in over her head ,
but since you clearly don &apos;t have the power
to include us in this deal ,
i think maybe i should call the partner on this case .
you know what ? you should .
but he &apos;s just gonna say this :
if you pursue a tro , we &apos;ll sue you
for tortious interference .
excuse me ?
you knew this sale was in process ,
and you waited till closing
to broach the topic .
that is tortious interference .
okay .
well , i think we &apos;re done here .
just take the money and walk away ,
or we will tie this up in court for years .
it &apos;s up to you . but then again , what do i know ?
i &apos;m just a newbie .
you lying piece of shit .
i lied because i &apos;m not the fool you think i am .
what the hell are you talking about ?
i &apos;m talking about your apology from the heart .
you actually had me falling for that bullshit
until you asked me if i was gonna suspend you .
and then i knew it was just all a goddamn manipulation .
you think me opening up about having panic attacks
is manipulation ?
i don &apos;t even think you really had panic attacks ,
let alone are going to therapy .
well , i am , and i opened up to you about it ,
and then you looked me in the eye ,
and you used mike &apos;s partnership to lure me back .
yes .
i did .
because i wanted you to know how it feels when someone
says one thing to your face and then turns right around
and does the exact opposite , like you did to me .
so this is payback for me sleeping with your sister ?
sure as shit is .
you son of a bitch .
i should take you outside right now--
and do what ? hit me again ?
because this time it won &apos;t just be a suspension , harvey .
you &apos;ll be gone .
that &apos;s enough .
no one &apos;s hitting anybody .
harvey , you &apos;re not to be alone with this man before that vote .
is that clear ?
this isn &apos;t over .
thank you , jessica .
a law firm should be a safe environment ,
and i started to feel like i was fearful--
shut the hell up , louis .
what you did in there was despicable .
it was underhanded and vindictive
and harmful to the entire firm .
i take it you won &apos;t be voting to discipline harvey .
i won &apos;t be voting at all .
and if you think you &apos;re gonna drag me into your bullshit ,
then you have another thing coming .
oh , you can abstain all you want ,
but everyone &apos;s gonna know exactly where you stand .
they already know where i stand .
and it &apos;s not with you .
you slapped her with a lawsuit ?
did she call you ?
no , she called google , and then they called me
to tell me they &apos;re pulling out of the deal .
what ?
yeah , they don &apos;t want
to run the risk this thing gets tied up in litigation ,
so they &apos;re out .
mike , i can explain .
no , you don &apos;t have to explain .
you explained the last time we talked .
excuse me ?
you &apos;ve got a problem with claire ,
and you &apos;re taking it out on this case .
i don &apos;t have a problem with claire .
i have a problem with you lying to her
about going to law school .
but the reason i threatened that suit
is because she didn &apos;t like not getting her way with me ,
and she was going to call you instead .
well , you stopped that from happening ,
and in the process , you blew up the entire deal .
did you hear me ? she was going to call you .
so i &apos;m sorry that google pulled out ,
but i didn &apos;t really have the chance
to think of every option--
every option ? there &apos;s only one .
you negotiate another price .
you think i didn &apos;t try that ?
the only thing she would have accepted
is being cut in on the deal , period .
all i know is that if i &apos;d been there ,
i would have figured out a way to get it done .
well , you know what ? you couldn &apos;t have been there .
and i don &apos;t appreciate you telling me
that i &apos;m not as good as you when the only reason
i was in that meeting in the first place
was to cover for you .
rachel , i &apos;m sorry , i didn &apos;t mean to make it personal .
well , it sure sounded personal when you accused me
of screwing up because i was jealous .
look , i just said that i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m only coming down on you the same way
harvey would come down on me in the same situation .
right , but you &apos;re not harvey , and i &apos;m not you .
and if harvey was talking to you
the way that you &apos;re talking to me ,
you would be in here right now telling me what a dick he is .
can i have that , please ?
what ?
i haven &apos;t done your transcriptions since yesterday , so ...
oh , it can wait . go home .
what ?
you went too far today , louis .
so , you &apos;re not really here to do work .
you &apos;re here to once again take harvey &apos;s side .
i &apos;m not taking harvey &apos;s side ,
but what you did in that meeting was wrong .
you told me to keep it in the family , and that &apos;s what i did .
i meant let jessica handle it , and you know it .
but jessica didn &apos;t handle it .
she tried to send harvey to the caribbean .
oh , so the only thing that you could do was blindside him
in the same meeting where mike is made junior partner ?
he assaulted me .
i understand that , louis .
but what i don &apos;t understand
is why you &apos;re the one who went in there angry ,
and he &apos;s the one who ended up attacking you .
donna--
what did you say to him ?
i don &apos;t have to explain myself to you .
no , you don &apos;t , and you &apos;re free to do whatever you want .
but when i saw your face after he hit you ,
i felt horrible for you .
but since you won &apos;t tell me what you said to him ,
i &apos;m starting to wonder if i should .
what &apos;s this ?
i know you had to reschedule the cake tasting
because of the case , so
i thought i &apos;d bring the cake tasting to you .
you didn &apos;t have to do that .
i wanted to , because i wanted to make sure
that you know that no matter what &apos;s going on at work ,
you &apos;re the most important thing in my life .
i know you were just trying to keep me from getting caught .
and i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry , too .
what for ?
because as much as i hate to admit it ,
i do have a problem with claire .
rachel--
mike , i was sitting across the table from her ,
and i could see all the reasons why you were interested in her .
and i--i had to wonder what would have happened
if she &apos;d never found out that you lied ,
or if she found out a year later
after she &apos;d gotten to know you better .
maybe the two of you would still be together .
we wouldn &apos;t be .
how do you know ?
because it might have taken me a while to tell you the truth ,
but from the first second i looked at you ,
i wanted to tell you everything about me .
and when i finally did tell you the truth ,
you didn &apos;t tell me that you never wanted to see me again .
you accepted me .
actually , i slapped you .
and then you kissed me .
yeah .
and stayed with me .
and loved me anyway .
jack .
what can i do for you , harvey ?
i wanted to thank you for standing up for me today .
i told jessica i &apos;m ready to be a team player .
maybe now the two of you will believe me .
well , i don &apos;t know if i &apos;m willing to go that far ,
but i appreciate what you did .
can i speak freely ?
go ahead .
you &apos;ve earned it .
i told mike the reason
that i went after you in the first place
was that everything comes easy to you ,
but i &apos;m not the only one that feels that way .
what &apos;s your point ?
i may have stopped louis
from suspending you for the moment ,
but that vote &apos;s not gonna go well for you .
you &apos;re saying i can do something to change the outcome .
i &apos;m saying you could do something to change the way
the partners feel about you .
you want me to take this suspension voluntarily ?
if this were a month ago ,
i &apos;d want you to take your name off the wall .
but you need to do something to humble yourself .
what exactly that is , is up to you .
how did you get in here ?
the receptionist told me where to find you .
well , she shouldn &apos;t have ,
so why don &apos;t you find your way out ?
claire , i &apos;m here to apologize .
look , you got under my skin
when you called me inexperienced
because the truth is i haven &apos;t been doing this very long .
so i shot back ,
and i went overboard to try and--
show me that you were better than me .
yes , and i ended up blowing the deal for both of us ,
and i &apos;m sorry .
well , they say you learn from your mistakes .
that &apos;s the thing .
i have already learned ,
and i think that i have a way to get both of us a win .
gigadyne . they &apos;re a major client at your firm .
what if you were to bring them the acquisition of metadesk ?
why would they want this ?
because they need fulfillment software
to increase their sales in europe ,
and we &apos;re a perfect fit .
you researched my client ?
like i said , i learn from my mistakes .
hey .
oh , don &apos;t &quot; hey &quot; me .
you &apos;re up to something .
why would you say that ?
i worked for you for 12 years .
you think i can &apos;t tell when you &apos;re up to something ?
donna--
harvey ,
if you &apos;re coming to me in here ,
that means you don &apos;t want louis to know .
and i don &apos;t work for you anymore--i work for him .
i know that , and i know what i &apos;m about to ask
might put you in between me and louis .
but i want you to help me figure out something i can do
that &apos;ll move the partners not to suspend me .
then tell me this .
what did louis say to you that made you hit him ?
why are you asking me that ?
because you &apos;re asking me to pick your side ,
and i need to know if you deserve it .
donna ,
if you don &apos;t know me well enough to know
that i deserve your help by now ,
nothing i tell you is gonna matter .
but whether i deserve it or not ,
i guarantee you louis is going to have some dirty trick
up his sleeve for that vote .
louis , i need to talk to you for a second .
well , if you &apos;re here to tell me not to play dirty ,
you &apos;re wasting your breath because donna already did it .
i &apos;m not here to do that ,
because you already played dirty .
i &apos;m here to get you to vote against suspending harvey .
how the hell have i already played dirty ?
you knew my partnership would mean something to harvey ,
and instead of holding it outside of your feud ,
you used it to trick him back into the firm .
because , mike , it was the only way to get justice .
okay .
if you think that , then let me put this in terms
that you might understand .
harvey is jon snow , i &apos;m his uncle benjen ,
and you used me to lure him out
so that everybody could stab him to death .
how dare you defile game of thrones
by comparing harvey to jon snow .
that &apos;s not the point , and you know it .
the point is , you betrayed harvey ,
the same way that kid betrayed jon snow .
well , in that case , it was for the good of the watch .
yeah , i &apos;m sure that &apos;s what that kid thought , too .
but i guarantee you , he &apos;s going to regret stabbing his friend
for the rest of his miserable life .
daniel hardman &apos;s office .
i need to speak to him right now .
who may i say is calling ?
you know who it is , stacy .
now get him on the goddamn phone .
he &apos;s not here , but he left word for you .
he sent two packages .
either move forward on one of them ,
or he &apos;ll move forward on the other .
congratulations .
on what ?
on winning your first case as junior partner .
i won my first case as junior partner ?
mm @-@ hmm , turns out you had a brilliant idea .
oh , really ? and what was my brilliant idea ?
you know , for when i &apos;m sitting around
shooting the shit with the other partners .
you sent me back to claire
to propose that she have one of her own clients buy metadesk
and let optela stay on board .
rachel , that &apos;s amazing .
i can &apos;t believe she went for it .
she went for it , and gigadyne went for it .
did you just say gigadyne ?
yeah . why ?
rachel , gigadyne just announced they &apos;re getting into
the defense contracting business .
what ? when ?
yeah .
yesterday--they already have their first contract .
which means i just triggered a background check
on every single person involved in this deal .
mike , i am so sorry .
no , you couldn &apos;t have known .
and we don &apos;t have time for &quot; i &apos;m sorrys &quot; anyway .
we have to find a way to take care of this
before it &apos;s too late .
how are we gonna do that ?
we &apos;re gonna hide in plain sight .
i don &apos;t understand .
we &apos;re gonna take my name off all of the paperwork ,
and we &apos;re gonna hope to god nobody notices .
what are you doing in here ?
catching up on my work .
is that a problem ?
no .
it &apos;s just that i told you
that i didn &apos;t need you to do any transcribing .
and the way you said it got me thinking
about how you like making your plans on this thing .
and then i came across this .
donna--
you think me opening up
about having panic attacks is manipulation ?
i don &apos;t even think you really had panic attacks ,
let alone are going to therapy .
well , i am .
and i opened up to you about it ,
and then you looked me in the eye ,
and you used mike &apos;s partnership to lure me back .
yes .
i did .
because i wanted you to know how it feels
when someone says one thing to your face
and then turns right around
and does the exact opposite , like you did--
he revealed those things to you ,
and you recorded him so you could play it for the partners ?
i wasn &apos;t trying to record him saying those things .
i just wanted proof that he hit me .
bullshit !
you didn &apos;t care what you got .
you just wanted to get him .
you &apos;re damn right i did .
he hit me .
he got esther .
he gets away with everything .
maybe he does .
and if you want to try to get him suspended ,
that &apos;s your right .
but if you use his weaknesses to publicly humiliate him ,
i &apos;m done working for you .
rachel ,
what are you doing here ?
we already sent back all of the contracts .
i know , i just came by
because you missed a signature on the last page .
no , i didn &apos;t miss it .
i was holding off on signing it .
why ?
because i was wondering why you made changes
to seven different addendums without redlining them for me .
they &apos;re just signatory pages of a few lists of partners ,
so i didn &apos;t think that that warranted a redline .
you didn &apos;t or your partner didn &apos;t ?
neither of us did . he has a big client in defense ,
and so even though we don &apos;t rep gigadyne ,
he was worried they might see it as a conflict .
the reason he &apos;s worried is not because of a conflict .
it &apos;s because this transaction triggers a background check .
which means--
i told you the reason .
he &apos;s repping another client and--
he &apos;s lying to you , rachel .
you &apos;re gonna find this impossible to believe ,
but mike ross is a fraud , and he knows that i know .
that &apos;s why he sent you in at the last minute
when this was his deal from day one .
are you crazy ? he &apos;s a partner
at pearson , specter , litt ,
and you said your mike ross wasn &apos;t 45 .
so the mike that i know--
oh , my god , you know .
i don &apos;t know anything , except that we just need--
i &apos;m calling the d.a. &apos; s office right now if you don &apos;t tell me
what the hell &apos;s going on .
we &apos;re engaged .
so it is him .
claire , please , you can &apos;t turn him in .
this isn &apos;t about what i can &apos;t do .
how could you be with a man like that after you found out ?
because i already loved him .
well , i &apos;m sorry , rachel .
i just can &apos;t turn the other way .
don &apos;t you understand what this is condoning ?
yes , i understand what it &apos;s condoning ,
but you have to put yourself in my shoes .
imagine you found out a year later ,
after you already knew the kind of man he is inside .
look , claire , i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m telling you .
no , he &apos;s not a lawyer ,
but he did turn his life around .
you &apos;re a smart woman , rachel .
but you are making a huge mistake .
please , i am begging you .
it &apos;s done .
she bought it ?
she did .
i can &apos;t believe it .
did you think i couldn &apos;t handle it ?
i guess i was just worried that she &apos;d figure it out anyway ,
expose me , and then--
there is no &quot; and then . &quot;
because that didn &apos;t happen .
because of you .
because of us .
you &apos;re wearing your ring at the office .
i am .
what made you decide to do that ?
i ... i just realized
how much i love you ,
and ...
that &apos;s not something i ever want to hide .
ra--
jessica , can i talk to you for a second ?
what is it , louis ? i &apos;m heading home for the night .
i want to call off the vote .
excuse me ?
the whole thing was a mistake .
i want to call it off .
louis , the vote is tomorrow morning .
the only way it doesn &apos;t happen
is if you publicly tell everyone that harvey didn &apos;t hit you .
i can &apos;t do that . i &apos;ll lose all credibility .
which is exactly why i wanted harvey to take two weeks .
to let you calm down .
because i knew you &apos;d change your mind .
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
i have a vote to prepare for .
wait , what if i flip my vote ?
flip whatever the hell you want , louis .
but you started this ball rolling ,
and now we all have to live with the consequences .
i thought you were trying to avoid me .
i was .
but then i figured out you knew it was me anyway .
how ?
does it matter ?
no , it doesn &apos;t .
so why are you here ?
i just wanted to say thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
i also wanted to know why you &apos;re letting it go .
because rachel begged me to .
and because she said that she loved you
and that you turned your life around .
and you believed her ?
i believe that she loves you .
but if you really want to know the truth ,
no , i don &apos;t believe that you turned your life around ,
and i definitely don &apos;t believe that you love her .
what ? how can you say that ?
because you &apos;ve convinced her that it &apos;s all gonna be okay ,
that you two are just gonna get to live happily ever after ,
and i didn &apos;t want to be the one
to make that all come crashing down .
but you know what , mike ?
one day , it is going to come crashing down .
and if you really do love her ,
you &apos;ll put a stop to this right now .
so , you think i should stop being a lawyer ?
i &apos;m saying if you really love her , you won &apos;t marry her .
