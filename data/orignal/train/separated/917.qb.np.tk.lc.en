in the &apos; 80s , gym class was not the politically correct ,
supportive environment we know today .
to say the least , was humiliating .
using these state @-@ sanctioned calipers ,
i will rank you by weight and girth .
let &apos;s grab that flab .
and it wasn &apos;t just our awkward bodies being judged .
it was also our athletic skill --
or lack thereof .
didn &apos;t make it to the wall in time .
assume the position .
they don &apos;t call it &quot; butts up &quot; for nothing .
how is this a sport ?
but the greatest indignity of all --
the sadistic ritual of picking teams .
sposato .
in a public shaming ,
the strong were separated from the weak .
my friends and i were always chosen last
for obvious reasons .
i &apos;ll take sirota .
sweet !
the kid picked third @-@ to @-@ last
was known as the &quot; i don &apos;t know . &quot;
i don &apos;t know . dave kim .
yes ! i &apos;m not the worst !
second @-@ to @-@ last was the &quot; i guess . &quot;
goldberg , i guess .
a fine choice .
the only thing worse than being picked last were the games ,
where the athletic ruled
and the scrubs desperately wished to go under the radar .
don &apos;t pass to me ! don &apos;t pass to me !
don &apos;t pass to me !
what ?
goldberg , you &apos;re the worst .
i welcome the feedback .
but luckily , for kids like me ,
there was another world where we were champions --
dungeons &amp; dragons .
long before xbox ,
there was a role @-@ playing game with 20 @-@ sided dice
and a dungeon master who led you on adventures using books
filled with monsters and treasure .
the firenewt is coming for you , gribald the unreasonable .
i use my potion of fire resistance .
it works .
yes !
oh , no . not this game .
i heard all about it on &quot; 60 minutes . &quot;
a stuffy southern reverend said it &apos;s the gateway to black magic .
don &apos;t worry , guys . i got this .
okay , mama ,
i won &apos;t play the thing that makes my heart happy .
you bewitched me , you little devil .
look away . i &apos;m doing this for us .
dungeons &amp; snuggles !
i &apos;m a little devil , and i like kisses .
it was april 6 , 1980 @-@ something ,
and my sister &apos;s plan for her future
was about to rock our mother to her very core .
mom , insanely great news .
i &apos;m gonna do what you want and stay in state for college .
in state ? that &apos;s where i live .
yes . good .
cmu it is .
where in philadelphia is cmu ?
um , carnegie mellon &apos;s only like a little bit west .
how far west ?
pittsburgh .
pittsburgh ? ! no . too far .
you &apos;re the worst daughter in the world .
come on , mom .
it &apos;s a great school with an amazing music program .
no , you &apos;re gonna go to jfa right here in town .
we discussed this .
i am not going to the jenkintown funk academy .
oh , so now you &apos;re too good for the funk .
yes , the funk is in a mini @-@ mall
between a dry cleaner and a balloon shop .
come on , mom .
even mr. glascott said cmu is perfect for me .
at least hear him out .
and then undermine and overpower him .
okay . sure thing . set that meeting .
dad , you need to come with us .
mom is in full sabotage mode .
this is my dream .
and it &apos;s my dream to have one less moron living in this house .
i &apos;ll help you .
i &apos;ll go , too .
college is a nonstop party .
you never even went to college , al .
yes , but i just watched &quot; back to school &quot;
with rodney dangerfield .
it &apos;s about this delightful old scamp
who goes back to school , and it &apos;s hilarious ,
&apos;cause let &apos;s face it --
a guy that old doesn &apos;t go back to school .
but he does .
he goes back to school but good .
are you done ?
i don &apos;t have to be .
while erica and my dad were struggling to get my mom on board ,
my friends were fighting their way through enemy territory .
as you climb out of the pit ,
a band of marauding orcs awaits you .
mondragor , your move .
earth to mondragor .
sorry , guys . i can &apos;t stop thinking about gym class .
we &apos;ve been picked last for years .
it &apos;s bull crap .
relax , dude .
the athletes rule now , but once we hit high school ,
our brains and elegance will be valued .
really ?
for sure .
until then , back to the orc attack .
more like dork attack ! nice .
oh , god .
face the facts , un @-@ kool &amp; the gang ,
you guys are doomed .
when did you even sit down ?
my point is , you guys got to figure out a way
to not get picked last before you &apos;re in high school .
otherwise , you &apos;ll never date ,
you &apos;ll never love , you &apos;ll never have joy .
later .
what if your mean @-@ spirited brother &apos;s right ?
i can &apos;t be bottom of the social chain in high school .
and just because i &apos;m the coolest one in our group
doesn &apos;t mean anything in the outside world .
okay , that settles it .
we &apos;re gonna break the cycle of dorkdom .
but how ?
i &apos;ll tell ya how !
tomorrow , i shall storm mellor &apos;s office
and demand an end to our oppression !
huzzah !
huzzah !
huzzah !
no !
come on . please .
picking teams has been the same
since the dawn of physical education .
the awesome jocks choose kids in descending order
of athletic ability .
what is the problem ?
the problem is the rest of us suffer .
turns out , gym class will determine
how society views us for the rest of our lives .
people ... really think that ?
of course .
don &apos;t you realize
gym is the most important class there is ?
well , i know that .
it &apos;s just , when the english department
doesn &apos;t invite you out for bowling night ,
it really gets in your head .
you hold the power , coach .
whatever you choose here today
could change the course of our whole lives .
let &apos;s do it .
tomorrow , you &apos;ll be the team captain ,
and you can choose all your nerd friends first .
sounds great ,
except for the part where you called us nerds .
losers it is , then !
tomorrow , the hierarchy of the physical @-@ education world
will be turned upside down ,
and all you dregs , dipwads , and dweebs , rejoice !
i had won over coach mellor ,
but my mom was hoping to sway mr. glascott to her team .
have to admit , i love it when an entire family comes together
to discuss a young lady &apos;s journey to college .
so any first thoughts ?
yes , uh that
okay , hot out of the gate .
so you came to voice some concerns .
i hope you &apos;re here to keep this conversation civil .
i &apos;ll do what i can .
gotcha .
uh , i &apos;m still not sure
what the gentleman in the corner is doing here .
i &apos;m considering going back to school myself .
ignore him . he saw a movie .
can we talk about cmu now ?
look , i know it &apos;s scary sending your baby out into the world ,
but this college can turn your little girl into a leader .
and in that moment , my mom saw more than just a brochure .
she saw the chance to make all of erica &apos;s dreams come true ...
it , uh ... does look a bit nicer than the funk academy .
... while my dad saw the reality of a world without his princess .
who are these guys ?
who are these guys ?
who are those guys ?
and pops just felt ripped off .
i don &apos;t see any hot tubs in the dorms .
are there hot tubs in the dorms ?
look ! you can study abroad . i could go to paris !
i &apos;ve always wanted to go to paris .
wait a minute . now she &apos;s going to a whole other country ?
erica , i ... didn &apos;t realize how wrong i &apos;d been .
i want this for you , sweetie -- all of it .
oh , my god . thank you so much .
let &apos;s go sign up for a tour .
well , looks like my work here is over .
it is over , &apos; cause there &apos;s no way
i &apos;m letting my pumpkin go to this hellhole .
but look at the girl in the pamphlet .
she &apos;s smiling under a tree with the boy in the wheelchair .
aww , look at him . he &apos;s holding a book .
okay , compromise .
the moron boys can get the hell out ,
but my little peanut , she &apos;s going to school in philadelphia .
i get it .
i got a bird . she &apos;s my princess .
if she flew away , i don &apos;t know what i would do .
wait . where are you going ?
what &apos;s with the getup ?
is there , like , a sports musical you &apos;re starring in ?
little production called gym class ,
and coach mellor &apos;s letting me be the leading man .
he made you captain ?
this is a game changer .
you got to pick smart .
for sure .
first my boy sirota , then dave kim , tiny tyler ,
lanky hank , and the foreign @-@ exchange kid
who knows nothing of our customs .
no !
this is the only time you &apos;ll ever be captain .
you can &apos;t pick the wienies .
you got to pick the winners , earn their respect .
this is a defining moment for you , bro .
barry made a convincing argument ,
but there was no way i &apos;d pick the athletes
over my best friends ...
i &apos;ll take corbett , big luke schmidt ,
spink ,
and taz money .
... but i found a way .
dude , what the hell did you just do to us ?
don &apos;t worry .
good news is , i &apos;m climbing the social ladder
by stepping on you guys .
it &apos;ll take a while , and i &apos;ll have to be
mean to you at first -- super @-@ mean --
but one day , we &apos;ll all be cool .
me first , though .
i don &apos;t like your plan at all .
oh , please , dave kim , you &apos;d do the exact same thing .
no way .
my allegiance would always be
to my friends and sergei the exchange student .
this betrayal will not stand .
much like &quot; revenge of the nerds , &quot;
we will dig deep and use our brains to defeat you
once and for all .
but there would be no revenge .
nice assist , goldie .
all you , taz money .
yes . well done , adam the betrayer .
come on , dave kim . i &apos;ll make it up to you .
switch teams .
that &apos;s a no .
after picking the best players ,
i was finally crushing at gym class .
also crushed my friends spirits .
enough ! this game has made a mockery of physical education .
now , i &apos;m not gonna name names , but there &apos;s a young man in here
with big ideas and small conviction .
adam . is adam .
that &apos;s right , foreign kid .
coach was sold a bill of goods on how to make this class fair ,
and he will deliver on that promise .
so , next class , we &apos;ll have the same teams ,
but , dave kim , you pick the game .
it can be anything you want --
chess , word puzzles , something with a calculator .
all right , then . i choose dungeons &amp; dragons .
&quot; the ghost tower of inverness . &quot;
what &apos;s happening ? why is half the class gasping ?
tournament module .
what he said , then . okay .
then -- and the winners get free pizza and losers run laps .
i &apos;m gonna eat so much pepperoni .
one slice per kid .
after deciding carnegie mellon was too far for erica ,
my dad had an idea for a different college choice --
one a lot closer to home .
what the hell , murray ?
i know you &apos;re exploring your many options for next year ,
but the way i see it , there &apos;s just one .
yeah , cmu .
goldberg u.
why go to college hundreds of miles away
when you can enjoy the comforts of campus life
right here at home ?
and so began the worst college tour of all time .
the school cafeteria .
it did not start out strong ...
shrimp parm three times a week .
... and then it got worse ...
our state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art dorm room .
... much worse ...
and don &apos;t forget our school mascot ,
the mighty cockapoo .
... and finally downright stupid .
here &apos;s our student lounge .
oh , look !
one of our esteemed faculty has stopped by .
i can &apos;t get over it .
he throws a party in his dorm room
after specifically being told not to .
we can &apos;t fire him . he &apos;s got tenure .
but the point is , you are going to goldberg u.
wait , so you spent your whole life
saying you wanted your kids out of the house ,
and now you want me to stay forever ?
yes .
well , i didn &apos;t apply , and also , this isn &apos;t a school .
murray , i &apos;m usually the irrational one
who keeps our children from enjoying their lives , not you .
all right , look at this movie .
that &apos;s what college is .
do you want erica to end up in a hot tub
with an elderly businessman ?
okay , you &apos;re kind of taking
some of the tickle out of the movie for me .
our daughter deserves a first @-@ class education .
she needs to experience life .
she can experience it here where she &apos;s safe
and we can protect her .
end of words !
good . now i can finally hear &quot; back to school . &quot;
what is it with you and this movie ?
he &apos;s living the dream .
i mean , what parent wouldn &apos;t want to go back to school with his kid ?
but a parent can &apos;t really do that .
but he does .
he does ?
at my mom was putting together a plan ,
i was planning a d &amp; d victory .
okay , it &apos;s been two hours , and there &apos;s been
a lot of wrestling and confusion on why d &amp; d is a thing ,
but here we are , so let &apos;s just continue .
zinethar the priest , your move .
my move is i change my name to dick biggens .
you can &apos;t change your name .
i meant you &apos;re facing a deadly , gelatinous cube .
how do you evade it ?
evade it ? let &apos;s kick that jell @-@ o &apos;s ass .
yeah .
it &apos;s a gelatinous cube .
if you attack it , it &apos;ll slurp you up and digest you alive .
sweet ! look at that busty hot chick .
that &apos;s not a chick .
it &apos;s a dryad , a deadly tree sprite .
can my guy make out with her ?
i want to make out with her , too .
what do i got to roll ?
fine .
a dryad suddenly appears .
if you roll a 20 , you can kiss her .
if not , we move on .
i take her back to my apartment , and we do stuff .
there &apos;s no apartment .
if you won &apos;t let me get busy with the tree lady ,
then i stab the jell @-@ o man in his face .
and you &apos;re paralyzed and slowly eaten alive .
end of game .
i &apos;ve heard enough .
time for barry to fix this .
where did he come from ?
he does that .
just go away . this is hopeless .
that &apos;s where you &apos;re wrong .
the only problem is , you guys don &apos;t speak the same language .
you speak lazy @-@ eyed nerd ,
and , like me , you speak awesome , all @-@ star athlete .
tater &quot; t &quot; ?
score .
yeah , man .
i like this bro .
of course you do .
even though i &apos;m ripped like you , my body has also been infected
by my brother &apos;s crippling geekery .
i tried to fight it , but it &apos;s too powerful .
and it &apos;s led to this .
dude , you created a d &amp; d character ?
lord big of tasty .
i wanted one ready in case you asked me to play ,
but ... you never did .
i just assumed you didn &apos;t care .
point is , if this crazy @-@ jacked bro
can learn how to play d &amp; d ,
other super @-@ shredded bros can , too .
i mean , sure , we &apos;re shredded , but we suck at this game .
adam keeps yelling at us and hurting our feelings .
that &apos;s &apos; cause you used a lightning @-@ bolt spell
in an underwater melee like a bunch of scrubs .
we &apos;re trying our best .
we &apos;re just not good at it like you .
do you have any idea how it feels to -- to suck so bad ?
actually , i do -- when i play basketball .
i @-@ i didn &apos;t know that .
yeah , man . sorry .
all right . lord big of tasty , teach us how to win .
i shall .
but first ...
coming off the top rope !
hey , boopie .
go away .
look , i wanted to apologize for your dad .
some people just don &apos;t understand
the boundary between parent and child .
are you high on nail polish ?
i never went to college .
this whole thing has made me realize
everything i missed out on , and at the end of the day ,
i couldn &apos;t bear it if you missed out on those things , too .
really ?
trust me , college is gonna be amazing .
we are gonna have so much fun .
oh , my god . thank you s--
wait . &quot; we &quot; ?
yes . crazy story .
i was watching this movie with pops , and --
please don &apos;t say &quot; back to school . &quot;
it was &quot; back to school , &quot; and i realized that could be us .
no ! dad !
wherever you are sitting or eating in this house ,
come to my room immediately .
it &apos;s an emergency .
i was both sitting and eating , so this better be worth it .
i &apos;m going to carnegie mellon with erica .
no .
we &apos;re gonna be roommates .
no !
we &apos;re gonna sneak in
a hot plate to cook ramen soup .
never !
and then we &apos;re gonna
rush the same sorority .
this is a nightmare .
and i &apos;ll be her mother and her sister .
kill me .
she &apos;s right , beverly .
you &apos;re acting nuts .
yes . thank you .
&apos;cause she &apos;s obviously not going away at all .
erica &apos;s staying here and being my little peanut .
what is wrong with you people ? !
seriously , i get no respect !
no respect .
that &apos;s exactly what rodney dangerzone says .
see ? we are on the same team .
no , we &apos;re not .
if either of you were on my team ,
you would actually hear my hopes and dreams
and not try to take them away or make them about you .
so just forget all of it .
i won &apos;t go to college at all .
i guess we both really blew it here , huh ?
mostly you .
as my parents were facing off against erica ,
our school gym &apos;s about to witness
the face @-@ off of a lifetime .
looks like goldberg and his merry band of meatheads
are a no show .
congrats , boys .
you just earned yourself a cheese pizza .
i have been in real dungeon .
but we did show -- ready to roll ... some dice .
dungeons &amp; dragons , anyone ?
whatever . by the end of this game ,
you guys aren &apos;t gonna know what end
of the staff of the magi you &apos;re holding .
well , if you &apos;re casting confusion ,
the staff of the magi gives the user a plus @-@ two
on saves versus magic , so , uh , good luck with that .
they &apos;ve learned our ways .
enough talk . let the battle begin .
dude !
i cast cure light wounds .
i draw my staff of striking .
lightning bolt ! lightning bolt !
thank you , cloak of displacement .
corbett , you &apos;re dead .
taz money , the basilisk turns you to stone .
face !
sirota , you &apos;re out .
come on , dm .
what kind of call is that ?
that day , the most amazing thing happened .
it was no longer jocks versus scrubs .
we were a class united in one belief --
d &amp; d was awesome .
it was the greatest game ever played in any gym class ,
and we loved it .
except for coach mellor ,
who didn &apos;t realize it would last four hours .
it &apos;s 6 : 30 p.m. i just want my life back .
in the end , two were left standing --
me and the friend i betrayed .
our d &amp; d game was ending ,
and with one last move ,
i would become a gym @-@ class hero .
all right , goldfarb , you reach the soul gem ,
you find a gelatinous cube slowly oozing towards you .
take the gem .
finish it up , goldberg .
easy lay @-@ up .
go ahead , betrayer . end it .
don &apos;t act like that .
me and my boys won this fair and square .
it &apos;s not about winning , man .
d &amp; d was the one thing we were good at ,
and now ...
you took that away , too .
take the gem and win the game already .
please .
i raise my sword ...
... and toss it aside
and swan @-@ dive directly into the gelatinous cube .
adam , no !
what ? are you crazy ?
no , no .
everybody , shut up .
you do realize you &apos;ll die if you touch the jell @-@ o thing .
i touch the jell @-@ o.
no !
stop !
i touch the jell @-@ o !
i touch the jell @-@ o !
and you &apos;re dead . dave kim &apos;s team wins .
somebody clean this up .
good game .
i don &apos;t get it .
you finally had their respect . why give it up ?
i guess it &apos;s not their respect i want .
and so , that day , i fell on my sword
to save something much more important ,
and my parents realized letting go was more important
than holding on .
hey , squishy . can we talk ?
oh , god , i &apos;m gonna cry . murray , you talk .
rough start .
look , you know how i sometimes say to you kids
that i want you out of the house ?
only three to five times a day .
yeah , well , the reason is it always seemed so far away .
then i blinked and here we are , and ...
i guess i just wasn &apos;t ready for it .
and don &apos;t worry .
i won &apos;t go to college with you . unless you want me to .
never .
you &apos;ll sleep on it .
that day , my parents started to let their peanut go ,
and me and my new friends realized it didn &apos;t matter
if you &apos;re picked first or last
&apos;cause we &apos;re all on the same team .
should &apos;ve cast a reverse gravity spell , holmes .
that &apos;s pretty impressive .
thanks .
what ?
you got psionic powers
and you &apos;re attacking with a dagger ?
what a dork .
barry , this is the third time you &apos;ve walked by .
do you , like , want to join us ?
let &apos;s do this , boys .
that &apos;s the thing about the adventure of life .
it doesn &apos;t matter if you win or lose .
it &apos;s who you have along for the ride .
stop ! i don &apos;t want you filming me , all right ?
stop !
lord big of tasty , in the clearing ,
you encounter a she @-@ wolf .
fight or flee ?
i do a few push @-@ ups to get pumped up , and i ask her out .
for sure .
yeah , boy .
but then , suddenly , her smokin &apos; hot twin sister &apos;s
also there , and she &apos;s like , &quot; hey , why don &apos;t we all party ? &quot;
and then we hop into the wolf hot tub that &apos;s also there .
there &apos;s no wolf hot tub !
come on , dm .
fine . if you roll a 20,
it &apos;s the best night of your life .
one . damn it !
the she @-@ wolves eat you .
anyone want to play monopoly ?
