so ... cellular mitosis is what ?
i miss troy .
wrong , and stop guessing that .
annie .
i &apos;m worried about abed .
he hasn &apos;t left the apartment since troy moved out .
he won &apos;t even play in the dreamatorium .
sorry , not &quot; play . &quot;
&quot; render imaginated dreamscapes . &quot;
guys , we just finished retaking biology all summer ,
and if i don &apos;t pass this final , it was for nothing .
can we stay on target ?
did someone say &quot; sexy construction worker &quot; ?
stay--stay on target .
i &apos;m dressed like this
because i &apos;m building to big news .
subway has officially ended its agreement with greendale ,
and the restaurant i &apos;ve chosen to occupy the cafeteria kiosk is ...
shirley &apos;s sandwiches !
i just need one of you to sign this
as the official owner of the business .
ooh , we should both sign it , we &apos;re 50 @-@ 50 partners .
but there &apos;s only one dotted line on the form , so ...
oh , well , pierce can--
me .
hey !
i paid for it .
well , there &apos;d be no &quot; it &quot; to pay for
if i hadn &apos;t done all the work .
my goodness , this molehill is becoming a mountain .
you guys work it out ,
while i put together an alpine costume .
i knew eventually you &apos;d try to box me out of my own business ,
just like hawthorne wipes did .
i &apos;m not letting you guilt me
into letting you call yourself the owner of my company .
jeff ! hello ?
get involved .
no .
i am here to replace my fake bachelor &apos;s
so i can get back to my life as a lawyer .
nobody else is sacrificing their interests .
don &apos;t ask me to sacrifice mine .
don &apos;t ask me to sacrifice mine .
that &apos;s you just now .
okay , so name the stages of mitosis .
ooh , i gotta go .
unbelievable .
today is abed &apos;s first therapy session .
his what ?
he &apos;s been feeling extra vulnerable lately
having lost troy to the air conditioning repair school ,
so he &apos;s finally gonna let me
practice my psych skills on him .
give me some credit , winger .
what &apos;s the worst that could happen ?
classic tee @-@ up .
使其颇为自信却也无法离开自己
shut up , leonard , i know about your crooked wang .
no such thing as bad press .
hey , abed .
this can &apos;t be good .
季终三集联播成功逆袭 ! !
第三季第二十二集 &#91; 本季终 · 谢谢支持 &#93;
there are those who ask , why connect the capillary tube
directly to the compressor valve ?
oh , sure , why not just attach it
to the moisture accumulator ?
hey , troy . we boring you ?
i miss my friends .
he misses his friends .
mr. barnes ...
gather your things and come with me .
now !
the sun chamber .
a shameful relic from a savage chapter of our history .
repairmen would duel each other inside ,
losers succumbing to heat exhaustion , or worse .
troy , there is a prophesy .
i miss abed so much .
i &apos;m ashamed to confess that i once thought
that this might be me .
now i realize that it &apos;s you .
you are the true repairman , troy .
you fix not only air conditioners ...
but the men who fix them .
it &apos;s a trade school . it &apos;s a two @-@ year degree
in boxes that make rooms cold .
sir , there &apos;s been a flow duct rupture in quadrant four .
i &apos;ll handle it .
this is your destiny , mr. barnes .
the true repairman will repair man .
abed .
i &apos;m not talking to you because i &apos;m not crazy .
think of it as inner dialogue .
i &apos;m reading the novelization of chronicles of riddick .
can you honestly tell me that &apos;s a saner decision ?
you &apos;re worried you &apos;ll go crazy without troy .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re gonna let britta fix you , right ?
because you think you &apos;re broken ,
you &apos;re gonna get diagnosed by someone
who said her favorite superhero was &quot; x man &quot; ?
i &apos;m a little scared . things are bad .
when the world gets bad enough , abed ,
the good go crazy . but the smart ...
they go bad .
come on in here , let &apos;s talk about it .
i think it &apos;s safer if i talk to britta .
i think it &apos;s even safer if i talk to her first .
hello .
are you here to help me with biology ,
or get me to help you ?
bi @-@ ol @-@ o @-@ gy .
are you lying ?
hard to break the word &quot; yes &quot; into lilting syllables , huh ?
ye @-@ es ?
look , pierce and i are so close
to getting the sandwich shop going .
i just need you to help--
look .
you want one piece of free advice ?
let pierce cool down .
you know how crazy and paranoid he can get .
a @-@ ha ! crazy ? paranoid ? impotent ?
cellular ...
i knew you &apos;d run to jeff ,
and turn him against me .
mitosis .
guys , why are we yelling ?
you sign that paper , i &apos;ll sue .
well , hold on .
this will be settled in greendale court , 3 : 00 p.m.
obviously , shirley has her counsel ,
and i get to dress like a judge .
i was born in a courtroom ,
sued it for my own placenta , and won .
now i &apos;m calling my lawyer .
my biology final is at 5 : 00 .
i &apos;m available from 3 : 00 to 4 : 00 .
i &apos;ll see you in court .
hello , abed ? ready to get therapized ?
abed ?
hello , britta .
come in .
what &apos;s going on ?
vice dean laybourne was repairing a flow duct rupture ,
and he inhaled a lethal dose of freon .
may his breeze join the wind .
okay , so mitosis is when cells divide ...
i wonder who pierce is gonna get to represent him .
i promise , whoever pierce brings
won &apos;t be prepared for me . that &apos;s the winger guaran--
is that the cold @-@ blooded former colleague
that got you fired from your old law firm
by ratting on you to the state bar ?
tee .
so is this a conflict of interest ?
you know , alan working at your former firm and all ?
hey , pierce just did you the biggest favor of your life .
he hired a guy i &apos;ve spent the last two years
fantasizing about stabbing in the--sundance !
tango !
so ... the case of the sandwich signature .
what are you doing here ?
i mean , me , i have to , but you ?
hawthorne &apos;s a cash cow ,
and old a @-@ con here is tugging at that teat .
that &apos;s money .
money .
please stop that .
so full disclosure . the firm would really like
to keep vitamin &quot; p &quot; in its medicine chest .
full disclosure .
i really want to be done by 4 : 00 .
oh , that &apos;s the jeff wing basket i remember loving .
hey , just go easy on shirley .
scout &apos;s honor , sinead o &apos;connor .
oy @-@ yay , oy @-@ yay , the honorable craig pelton presiding .
first off , there &apos;s one decision
i &apos;ll need your help making .
judging amy judge judy ?
you say your name is evil abed ,
which does not throw me , because i &apos;m a therapist .
so let &apos;s talk about evil .
you know what ? maybe i should talk to good abed instead .
where i come from , his name is lame abed .
and you come from ...
the darkest timeline .
you might call it the britta of timelines ,
where everything is the worst .
jeff has one arm there . annie shot pierce .
troy can &apos;t speak--
now we &apos;re getting somewhere . i think lame abed sent you
to talk because you &apos;re more equipped to deal with fear .
that &apos;s the lame way of seeing it , yes .
here &apos;s the truth .
i &apos;ve crossed into your dark timeline ,
and now i &apos;m going to darken it .
how ?
tell me about your parents , britta .
um ... no ?
barnes , you should be in the chapel .
we lost a great man today .
yeah , he was the best , wasn &apos;t he ?
that &apos;s why i don &apos;t understand
how he could rupture a freon line .
that &apos;s kind of a rookie mistake .
i &apos;m sure it was just a faulty valve .
my first order as vice dean ,
i &apos;m gonna have them all replaced .
so you &apos;re vice dean now ?
why the sudden interest in air conditioning repair ?
i thought you missed your friends .
i do .
then go be with them .
i &apos;m releasing you .
but you--
good @-@ bye , troy .
miss edison , do you recognize the baby in that picture ?
that &apos;s shirley &apos;s baby ben .
would you think less of shirley bennett
if she offered to sell ben on craigslist
for a chance to bump it with denzel ?
that was a joke for my cousin .
damn those facebook privacy settings .
jeff , do something .
he &apos;s got nothing .
i &apos;m sure she didn &apos;t mean that .
or perhaps she doesn &apos;t even love that baby ,
because she spent most of last year not even knowing
who the father is .
objection .
establishing character , your honor .
this woman is clearly unfit to own a sandwich shop .
alan , come on .
no furths .
i thought you said you were gonna go easy .
felt easy to me .
what was he wearing ?
he was dressed as a dinosaur .
is that why you dropped out of high school ?
i don &apos;t know .
are those even real glasses ?
no .
ah , do you feel that , britta ?
your timeline &apos;s 10 % darker now .
this was 10 % ?
do you know what kind of person becomes a psychologist , britta ?
a person that wishes , deep down ,
that everyone more special than them was sick ,
because &quot; healthy &quot;
sounds so much more exciting than &quot; boring . &quot;
you &apos;re average , britta perry .
you &apos;re every kid on the playground that didn &apos;t get picked on .
you &apos;re a business casual potted plant ,
a human white sale .
you &apos;re vh1 , robocop2,
aback to the future 3 .
you &apos;re the center slice of a square cheese pizza .
actually , that sounds delicious .
i &apos;m the center slice of a square cheese pizza .
you &apos;re jim belushi .
12 %
where are you going ?
to make this timeline the darkest of all .
starting with your lame hero , jeff winger .
i don &apos;t suppose lame abed owns a bone saw .
so , pierce , you &apos;re seeking full ownership of shirley &apos;s sandwiches .
after all , you did provide 100 % of the financing .
correct .
you really did ? oh , damn it .
jeez , i came to this thing unprepared .
i mean , i @-@ i guess it &apos;s my job to somehow tarnish you
in the eyes of the court , but , uh ...
let me check my notes .
take your time .
thanks .
hey , uh , while i &apos;m doing this ...
does anybody know any funny jokes ?
i do .
an irish and a jew walk
into a chinese laundry ...
with a gay duck .
all right , okay !
oh , right !
so you &apos;re telling me they &apos;re not good at basketball ?
i have no questions , your honor .
cruel . cruel , cruel , cruel .
in the name of the five winds ...
east , west , north ,
the one we keep secret , and south ,
i hereby proclaim you--
this ceremony is a lie .
and having a special room for it
is a waste of valuable floor space .
you are no longer a student here .
and we use this room for yoga on weekends .
remove him .
i am the truest repairman .
and this man is a dishonor
to making air conditioners work good .
and i have the right to challenge him ...
in the sun chamber .
holy crap .
your less than honor , can i call a recess ?
ooh , yay , costume change .
court briefly adjourned .
what are you trying to do , winger ?
zealously represent your client ?
let me make things a little easier for you .
figure out a way to throw this case ,
or figure out where you &apos;re gonna work
when you get out of here , because i don &apos;t know
where it &apos;s gonna be if it &apos;s not for us .
that &apos;s right , jeff . i went there .
you drove me there . miss daisy &apos;s in the house ,
thanks for the ride , sorry about slavery .
don &apos;t oversell your clout , alan .
you &apos;re partner because i sold you to ted .
ted respects me--
ted &apos;s gone .
he got too old , couldn &apos;t swim with the sharks , and got eaten .
that makes no sense . he started the firm .
you can &apos;t lose your own firm .
you can if you &apos;re dead .
that shark thing was not a metaphor .
i &apos;m the big dog now .
so you want the last three years
in this toilet to have a point ?
then i &apos;m the guy you got to make happy .
or , you know , you could finish up your big win here .
court is in session .
blind justice presiding-- aah ! oh , my god !
ahh ! oh , one more recess .
i hit the corner right on a fresh tattoo .
well boys and girls ,
i hope you brought your popsicles ,
because it &apos;s about to get scalding hot
in the sun chamber .
you already know the rules ...
because there aren &apos;t any !
jeez , dennis , are you on coke ?
take that crap off and sit down .
sorry about that . of course there are rules .
two men are sealed in the chamber ,
each with a broken unit .
the heat will increase until one man yields ...
or dies .
begin !
you &apos;re just in time for jeff &apos;s closing statements .
who cares ? everything is terrible .
oh , no . have you been watching dance moms again ?
i &apos;m thinking of dyeing my hair .
evil abed , what are you doing ?
i &apos;m going to cut off jeff winger &apos;s arm .
i won &apos;t let you . that &apos;s horrible .
don &apos;t you mean dark ? welcome to my world .
jeff ! winger !
jeffrey , this is a-- a terrible situation
for me to have put you in .
a guy like alan isn &apos;t above making trouble for you
at your old firm .
shirley , i--
it &apos;s not worth your career .
i want you to have what you want .
thank you , shirley .
settle down .
okay , jeffrey , let &apos;s have your closing statement .
your honor ...
i have no closing statement ,
because i &apos;m throwing the case .
no , no , it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s fine , don &apos;t worry .
my client , shirley bennett ,
my friend of three years ,
she told me that it was okay .
she said what i want was more important .
she &apos;s right , right ?
i mean , guys like me ,
we &apos;ll tell you there &apos;s no right or wrong .
there &apos;s no real truth .
i &apos;ll kill you .
i &apos;ll kill you just like i killed him .
and as long as we all believe that ,
guys like me can never lose .
was that out loud ?
because the truth is ...
i &apos;m lying when i say there is no truth .
the truth is-- the pathetically , stupidly ,
inconveniently obvious truth is ...
helping only ourselves is bad ,
and helping each other is good .
now i just wanted to get out of here ,
pass biology , and be a lawyer again
instead of helping shirley .
that was bad .
and my former colleague
wanted so badly to keep his rich client
that he just asked me to roll over
in exchange for my old job .
so i guess we all walked in here pretty bad .
but now ...
shirley &apos;s gone good .
shirley &apos;s helping me .
it &apos;s that easy .
you just stop thinking about what &apos;s good for you ,
and start thinking about what &apos;s good for someone else .
and you can change the whole game
with one move .
now if you like this idea , you can make it true
by doing something good for everyone here .
throw this case out of court . it &apos;s dumb .
that is all .
i withdraw my case .
why didn &apos;t you just do some
inspirational speech about friendship ?
you &apos;re fired .
way to go , soft serve . you &apos;re finished .
by the way , never got a chance to tell you this ,
but it was me who turned you in to the state bar .
i know .
and i never got a chance to thank you .
this place has made you so gay .
hey ! don &apos;t use &quot; gay &quot; as a derogatory term .
booyah , good person .
gentlemen , take this man
to the infinite labyrinth of eternal ice .
yes !
no !
no , take him to the police .
he murdered someone . take him to jail .
you guys are weird .
jeff , that was great .
you were like a white blair underwood .
shirley , if you &apos;re willing , i think
we should let jeff sign the sandwich shop form .
yeah , you could represent both of us .
you know , like our attorney .
my god , pierce ! you had your first good idea .
thank you .
britta , i &apos;m so sorry .
it doesn &apos;t matter , abed .
i should &apos;ve never played therapist with you .
i &apos;ll change my major just one more time .
but you can &apos;t . you cured me .
i mean , i &apos;m not cured . i &apos;m willing to admit
i definitely need therapy .
you &apos;re the only kind of shrink i could ever trust .
the kind with as little control over my mind as me .
mind if i cut in ?
troy !
you &apos;re back .
yeah , i made a new rule
that the air conditioning repair school
has to act like a regular school .
i can do that because i &apos;m their messiah .
cool . i went crazy and i wanted to cut off jeff &apos;s arm .
i missed you so much , buddy .
so , jeff , we still best friends ?
all right .
cellular mitosis . what is it ?
