guys , look ! ugly naked guy &apos;s putting stuff in boxes .
i &apos;d say our naked buddy is moving .
ironically , most of the boxes seem to be labeled &quot; clothes . &quot;
i &apos;m going to miss that big old squishy butt .
and we &apos;re done with the chicken fried rice .
if he &apos;s moving , maybe i should try to get his place !
it would be so cool to live across from you guys .
we could do that telephone thing ...
... where you have a can , we have a can ... and it &apos;s connected by a string .
or we could do the actual telephone thing .
he &apos;s got packing tape stuck to where you really don &apos;t want it .
get it off , fat man ! get it off !
oh , no , he &apos;s trying to pull it off slowly .
take it from me , if you &apos;re gonna pull tape off yourself , it &apos;s gotta be in one quick motion .
like that .
the one where everyone finds out
oh , my god . i love this apartment !
isn &apos;t it perfect ?
i can &apos;t believe i never realized how great it is !
because your eye goes to the big naked man .
it &apos;s amazing ! hurry up with an application , or i &apos;ll beat you to it .
well , i &apos;m going to use ugly naked guy &apos;s bathroom .
look ! there &apos;s monica and chandler .
hey , you guys !
chandler and monica !
oh , my god !
chandler and monica
oh , my eyes ! my eyes !
it &apos;s okay !
they &apos;re doing it !
i know ! -i know !
you know ?
yes , i know it . joey knows ,
but ross doesn &apos;t , so stop screaming !
what &apos;s going on ?
what ?
nothing !
we are so excited that you &apos;ll get this apartment !
looks really good.looks pretty good !
get in here ! come on !
you mean whenever monica and chandler ... were doing laundry or going grocery shopping ?
the time monica spent on the phone with linda from camp ?
doing it , doing it , phone , doing it .
i can &apos;t believe it !
i think it &apos;s great . for him.she could do better .
hey , you guys .
come here !
phoebe found out about monica and chandler .
you mean how they &apos;re friends and nothing more ?
joey , she knows .
we saw them doing it through the window .
actually , we saw them doing it up against the window .
we saw them fornicating .
so they know you know , and they don &apos;t know that rachel knows ?
yes , but it doesn &apos;t matter who knows what .
now enough of us know that we could just tell them we know .
all the lying and the secrets will finally be over .
or , we could not tell them we know , and have a little fun .
what do you mean ?
if they say they are doing laundry , we &apos;ll give them laundry to do .
i would enjoy that .
you know what would be even more fun ? telling them .
that doesn &apos;t sound like fun .
so we &apos;ll make it fun .
we &apos;ll do it like a barbershop quartet !
we know , we know , we know
no , i want to do phoebe &apos;s thing .
i can &apos;t take ... you don &apos;t have to do anything . just don &apos;t tell them we know .
i can &apos;t take anymore secrets .
i got your secrets , their secrets , secrets of my own .
you don &apos;t have any secrets .
well , you don &apos;t know about hugsy , my bedtime penguin pal .
so how are we going to mess with them ?
you could use your position as the roommate .
and i would use the strongest tool at my disposal.my sexuality
hello , children .
watch . learn . and don &apos;t eat my cookie .
that jacket looks great on you.-really ?
the material is so soft.hello , mr. bicep .
you &apos;re working out ? i try to squeeze things .
are you okay ?
if you really want to know i can &apos;t tell you this .
you can tell me anything .
actually , you are the one person i can &apos;t tell this to.and the one person i want to the most .
what &apos;s going on ?
i just haven &apos;t been with a guy in so long ...
... and sometimes you &apos;re looking for something ... and it &apos;s right there in front of you , sipping coffee
oh , no . have i said too much ?
just something to think about . i know i will .
you are so cute.how did you get to be so cute ?
my grandfather was swedish.and my grandmother was a tiny little bunny .
now you &apos;re even cuter .
you know , that is a popular opinion today , i must say .
the weirdest thing happened at the coffeehouse.phoebe was hitting on me .
what are you talking about ?
i think phoebe thinks i &apos;m foxy .
it &apos;s not possible .
i &apos;m sorry , phoebe &apos;s just always thought you were charming ... in a sexless kind of way .
you know , i can &apos;t hear that enough .
i just think you misunderstood her .
i didn &apos;t , okay ? she was all over me .
she touched my bicep , for crying out loud .
this bicep ?
well , it &apos;s not flexed right now .
why is it so hard for you to believe that phoebe could be attracted to me ?
it &apos;s not.all the girls are attracted to you .
you &apos;re part bunny .
mon , you want to come see a movie with us ?
actually , i was going to do some laundry .
want to do it with me ? sure , i &apos;ll do it with you .
okay , great . hold on a second .
here you go .
that would really help me out a lot . thanks .
you know what ? i don &apos;t have enough quarters.i have quarters !
great . now we can do laundry all night . all night laundry !
hey , any word on the apartment yet ?
i called there , and it turns out naked guy is subletting it .
he &apos;s already had 100 applicants.-oh , man .
no , no , it &apos;s okay.because you know what the difference between them and me is ?
your history of bedwetting ?
hey , i trusted you , man !
anyway , the difference is ... i &apos;ve got the edge .
it &apos;s not exactly ethical , but i sent him a bribe ... to tip the scales in my direction .
you can see it from the window .
is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it ?
that new mountain bike ?
what did you send ? a basket of mini muffins .
there &apos;s a whole table of them . which one did you send ?
the small one .
you actually thought that basket was going to get you the apartment ?
someone sent us a basket at work , and people went crazy over those muffins .
it was the best day .
your work makes me sad .
oh , man , i want that place so much !
and i was so sure that was going to work .
there &apos;s 12 bucks i &apos;ll never see again .
we &apos;d better go if we want to catch that movie .
bye .
bye , chandler . i miss you already .
did you see that ? the inappropriate , and the pinching ?
actually , i did .
so do you believe that she &apos;s attracted to me ?
oh , my god ! she knows about us !
are you serious ? she knows , and she &apos;s trying to freak us out !
that &apos;s the only explanation !
but what about my pinchable butt and my bulging biceps ?
she knows !
joey
yeah
phoebe knows about us .
i didn &apos;t tell them !
them ? who &apos;s &quot; them &quot; ?
phoebe and joey .
joey
and rachel .
i would have told you , but i promised not to tell .
man . i &apos;m sorry.but it &apos;s over now , right ?
you can tell them you know they know ,
and i can go back to knowing nothing !
unless ... not &quot; unless &quot; ! this must end now !
they think they are so slick messing with us .
but they don &apos;t know that we know that they know .
so the messers become the messees !
come on , you guys . think how much fun it would be to tell.we know , we know , we know
what ?
oh , that wasn &apos;t you .
honey , you got to stop torturing yourself
why don &apos;t you find another apartment ?
i &apos;ve already looked at 1000 apartments this month.none of them even compares to that one .
well , except for one , but i would have had to share it with an armenian family .
grandma really liked me .
but i want ugly naked apartment !
you know what ?
you should find out his hobbies and use that to bond with him .
like if i wanted something from joey ... i would strike up a conversation about sandwiches
... or my underwear .
i &apos;m listening .
see ?
that is a great idea !
and i know ugly naked guy because we &apos;ve been watching him for five years .
so that gives me back my edge !
let &apos;s see now . he had the trampoline.he broke that .
he had gravity boots .
he broke those too .
so he likes to break stuff .
i &apos;ve got to go pick up ben . but i will figure something out .
didn &apos;t he used to have a cat ?
i wouldn &apos;t bring that up . it would bum him out .
poor cat never saw that big butt coming .
hello
hold on a second , she &apos;s right here .
it &apos;s chandler .
hello , you .
phoebe , i &apos;ve been thinking about you all day .
you know that thing you said before ? i was intrigued .
really ?
joey won &apos;t be here tonight .
why don &apos;t you come over ? i &apos;ll let you feel my bicep .
or maybe more .
i &apos;ll have to get back to you on that.okay bye
he wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more !
are you kidding ?
i cannot believe he would do that to mon
joey ? do they know that we know ?
no . joey
they know you know.i knew it !
i would say , &quot; thank god ! everybody knows ! it &apos;s finally over ! &quot;
but that hasn &apos;t been working for me .
i cannot believe those two !
they thought they could mess with us ? trying to mess with us ?
they don &apos;t know that we know they know we know .
joey , you can &apos;t say anything .
couldn &apos;t if i wanted to .
good evening , sir . i &apos;m ross geller . i &apos;m one of the applicants .
i realize that the competition is fierce but ....
i &apos;m sorry , i can &apos;t help but notice that you &apos;re naked .
i applaud you.man , i wish i was naked .
i mean , this looks so great .

rachel , get me perfume .
joey , can you get me a bottle of wine and glasses ?
all right , thanks , but glasses that do not have handles and that are glass .
and wine that is not olive oil .
it &apos;ll be great
make her think you want to have sex with her and it will freak her out .
how far am i gonna have to go with her ?
she &apos;ll give in way before you do .
how do you know ?
because you &apos;re on my team . my team always wins .
