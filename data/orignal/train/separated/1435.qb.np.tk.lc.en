want some coffee ?
say yes . it &apos;s french press .
i was doubtful , too ,
but i honestly can &apos;t see myself going back to drip .
i &apos;m so happy you don &apos;t live in a tough neighborhood anymore .
we &apos;re so sorry for just dropping by like this .
are you kidding me ?
i &apos;ll take any chance to spend time with this little princess .
i love her little hair , her little toes .
and she loves her grandmother .
i don &apos;t love &quot; grandmother . &quot;
so , cam and i have been revising our will
to specify who should take care of lily
if , god forbid , something happened to us .
god forbid .
i said &quot; god for-- &quot;
so , we &apos;ve been dropping by unannounced
to , you know , casually assess our candidates .
not all of our candidates .
no , t @-@ that &apos;s true . we did not drop by missour @-@ ah .
it &apos;s &quot; missouri . &quot;
no one from missouri would say &quot; missour @-@ ah . &quot;
i &apos;m so sorr @-@ ah .
so , anyway , claire and phil were our first thought ,
so we dropped by their place last week .
you win the award for worst mother ever !
i will be sure to thank you in my speech !
phil , the frying pan &apos;s on fire !
son of jor @-@ el ! everybody stay calm !
dad , i &apos;m gonna teach myself how to juggle .
good for you , buddy .
mom ! no one heard me screaming ? !
i &apos;ve been trapped in the garage for like 20 minutes !
and yet still you didn &apos;t get the rat traps i sent you for .
oh !
thank you .
honey , it &apos;s doing it again !
come on , now ! every morning ? !
i hope the whole house burns down !
did we come at a bad time ?
come back in seven years and five months ,
when they &apos;re all gone !
so , mama , you &apos;re good for coal ? !
okay , okay !
well , you bundle up !
we don &apos;t want to lose you !
okay . yeah , bye !
they &apos;re in the middle of a terrible blizzard .
so you shouted !
did they really lose two cows ?
oh , yeah , frozen solid . mama &apos;s gonna send pictures .
oh , yay , a reason to stop by the frame store .
manny , i got to get you down to that sporting @-@ goods place .
got to get him some stuff for his weekend outing .
ready !
did you pee ? not ready .
jay , would you mind if we came ?
sure , why not ?
you know , i &apos;d like to get mama some snowshoes --
you know , to lift her spirits ,
what with all the frozen cows and all .
so , cows freeze now ? are we all just accepting that ?
oh , yeah , absolutely . jay , this one time --
we &apos;ll take two cars .
if you want , i can stay with the little princess .
oh , that-- that &apos;s a great idea .
oh , yeah , i &apos;ll just -- i &apos;ll just go out and get her bag .
maybe i can take her to the mall ,
buy her a new outfit ,
get her some hair rings -- is that okay ?
yes , yes , of course .
um , you know , gloria , cam and i were talking
about what would happen to lily
if anything were ever to happen to us ,
and we were thinking
oh , my god . is it ? i take her !
okay , well , that &apos;s very sweet ,
but you realize it would only happen --
i can &apos;t wait !
okay , well , hopefully , it &apos;s a long shot .
ay , a little girl !
there would have to be a very tragic accident .
i know , i know .
nothing is going to happen .
oh .
but if it did , we would be so happy !
so , what do you say , pal ? i got to swing by the office .
you want to come along ?
can &apos;t . we got some stuff to do .
what ?
just errands .
i &apos;m taking luke to see a child psychologist .
this is something that phil would never agree to .
he &apos;s doesn &apos;t want luke to feel ... different .
but luke &apos;s grades aren &apos;t great ,
and he &apos;s having trouble concentrating in school .
i just want to make sure that he &apos;s ... normal .
hey , mom , check it out .
what are you doing ?
if i move my head fast enough ,
it looks like the can is standing still .
&apos;cause sometimes i wonder .
but all the girls at work love it
when i bring luke by ,
especially that receptionist heather , right , buddy ?
she smells amazing .
mm . well , honey , you &apos;re gonna have to
smell daddy &apos;s receptionist some other time .
like peaches .
if you &apos;re both going out , who &apos;s taking me to cello ?
one time , she gave me a woody .
sweet je--
she remembered he &apos;s my favorite character from &quot; toy story . &quot;
she did .
uh ... haley , how are you getting to the mall ?
uh , gabby &apos;s picking me up .
okay , you &apos;re gonna drop
your sister off at her cello lesson first .
no way . she plays lacrosse and takes cello lessons .
even my reputation can &apos;t handle that dork hit .
okay , well , then you don &apos;t need
to go snowboarding with your friends on break .
fine , i &apos;ll take her .
just never look my friends in the eye ,
and only speak in emergencies .
got it .
ah ! already failed .
honey , after i go by the office ,
maybe we can grab some lunch .
oh , i can &apos;t .
i got to pick up all that stuff for the school trip .
but you know what ? i &apos;ll see you tonight at dad and gloria &apos;s .
okay .
smell heather for me .
i always do ... not .
ms. dunphy ?
hi , dr. klausner .
i am so sorry we &apos;re late .
we just got a little bit caught up in --
oh , no , it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay .
it gave me a chance to chat with your husband .
hello , claire .
so , luke , come on in with me .
mom and dad , we &apos;ll let you know when we need you .
go get &apos; em , pal .
how did you -- - how did i what ?
know you were someplace you left no trace of
except for a tiny notation in your calendar ?
it was quite simple , really .
i noticed a tiny nota--
shoot .
that &apos;s weird . my cello teacher &apos;s car isn &apos;t here .
i wonder if she &apos;s not home .
okay , so go knock on the door , alan einstein .
don &apos;t leave . and it &apos;s &quot; albert . &quot; - i know .
alan &apos;s his dorky brother who played the cello .
good one .
i should probably not be telling you this .
what ?
nothing . it &apos;s really bad .
tell me .
when you and dylan were broken up ,
rachel told him you were a skank
and got all up on him .
no ! but she &apos;s so nice to me .
to your face . that &apos;s how she plays .
well , now she &apos;s gonna see how we play .
what are we gonna do ?
she &apos;s not there . you &apos;re just gonna have to take me home .
we don &apos;t have time . we have stuff to do .
then i &apos;m just gonna have to come with you .
can &apos;t we just drop her off
at a coffee shop or something ?
what , so she gets kidnapped
and i get in trouble ?
no , thank you .
okay , fine , you can come with us ,
but you have to keep your mouth shut about anything you see .
what &apos;s she gonna see ?
just drive !
ooh , maybe i should also get a gift for my aunt pat .
have i ever told you about her ?
total gun nut , lives completely off the grid .
did you see how cute gloria was with lily ?
oh , pat is hilarious .
i don &apos;t think she &apos;s paid taxes in 20 years ,
but very hospitable .
always has a deer in the freezer .
would you listen to me ?
i think that gloria and my dad
could be lily &apos;s guardians .
look , you know i love jay ,
and they &apos;re still in the mix ,
but i just don &apos;t know about him raising a child .
well , cam , he raised me .
well , now you &apos;ve put me in an awkward position .
oh , look at that . that &apos;s adorable .
let &apos;s see if we can get you some snow pants .
i just wish i felt better .
i think i &apos;m coming down with flu @-@ like symptoms .
couple of hours before your camping trip , huh ?
i want to go .
it &apos;s just , if i &apos;m sick ,
i might get the chaperones sick ,
and without chaperones , it &apos;s anarchy .
manny , listen to me .
the buddy system falls apart ,
the principle of &quot; last in , first out &quot; is ignored .
it &apos;s butterflies .
where ?
you &apos;re just nervous because
there &apos;s gonna be a lot of physical activity ,
which is not exactly your strong suit .
it is a little daunting out there .
d @-@ don &apos;t use the word &quot; daunting &quot; in nature , okay ?
you just need a little self @-@ confidence .
look at this . they got one of these rock walls here .
why don &apos;t you hop up on that ?
why ?
why ? to prove that you can do it .
if you can do that , you can do anything .
really ? can i fly ? can i speak chinese ?
no , but you can sleep in the house tonight .
ace ? want to wire my boy up , here ? go ahead .
i &apos;m sorry i went behind your back .
but you get so defensive whenever
we talk about luke &apos;s issues .
he doesn &apos;t have issues . you &apos;re just a worrier .
like when you thought he was never gonna talk .
he was 2 , and all he could do was bark !
i understood him .
phil !
look , he starts coming here ,
the other kids find out , he becomes a target ,
like that limping gazelle at the watering hole
that the alligator knows to eat .
they &apos;re crocodiles , not alligators .
there are no alligators in africa .
how about at the zoo ?
bam ! who needs a shrink now ?
mr. and mrs . dunphy ?
yes ?
hi .
luke , i &apos;m gonna talk to your mom and dad for a minute , okay ?
okay . she &apos;s , like , the best doctor ever .
a couple of puzzles , no shots .
i didn &apos;t even have to take my pants off .
found that one out a little late .
i &apos;ve been there , buddy .
well , luke &apos;s a terrific kid .
i have a few thoughts , but , honestly ,
i don &apos;t see anything that &apos;s cause for alarm .
awesome . thanks so much for your time .
we -- we would love to hear your thoughts .
well ... he &apos;s a bright and curious boy ,
but he gets distracted .
i see it all the time with above @-@ average kids .
phil , honey , i want you to hear this .
they &apos;re a little overstimulated
because there are so many things they &apos;re interested in .
they never seem to focus .
makes me crazy .
too crazy .
well , they usually do outgrow it .
what if they don &apos;t ?
he will .
well , there &apos;s -- there &apos;s medication ,
but why don &apos;t we cross that bridge if we come to it ?
is there any way to avoid that bridge altogether ?
you know , maybe there &apos;s diet or --
or focusing exercises or something ?
mrs. dunphy , what exactly are you worried about ?
get comfortable .
i &apos;m worried he &apos;s turning into you , phil .
i knew the minute i opened my mouth
that i was in the wrong ,
but , honestly , sometimes i wonder about him .
hey , mom , check it out .
what are you doing ?
if i move my head fast enough ,
it looks like the can is standing still .
he &apos;s totally right !
i just find it interesting that you blame jay
for everything from your night terrors to your shy bladder ,
and now he &apos;s the perfect guardian for lily .
no , not perfect , and -- and
i never said anything about my shy bladder .
o @-@ oh . then why did i have to stand guard outside the bathroom
at pepper &apos;s three faces of new year &apos;s eve party ?
damn it , manny ! move it ! go !
it &apos;s scary .
you &apos;re 2 feet off the ground .
i &apos;ve seen vines climb walls faster than that .
move your butt !
oh , well , there &apos;s your esteem @-@ building parent right there .
wait , wait , i think i hear future lily
sending us a message from her stripper pole --
&quot; thanks , gay dead dads .
this dance is for you . &quot;
excuse me , jay ?
i &apos;m getting down .
not till you touch the top ! what is it ?
well , maybe if we didn &apos;t bully manny so much ,
but , rather , showed him ,
he wouldn &apos;t be so afraid .
excuse me , sherpa , can you assist me with the harness ?
oh , no . which one of these is my driving machine ?
phil , i already apologized .
it just -- it came out wrong .
funny , i thought that was my problem --
i came out wrong .
hold on .
oh , good , i can walk again .
honey , you know , sometimes you can act a little bit --
oh , no ! where did everyone go ? !
oh , just a blink .
phil ,
when you are ready to talk to me like an adult ,
why don &apos;t you let me know ?
fine . okay , okay .
the adults are the big ones , right ?
hey , how do you think that got up there ?
now , i know it seems daunting ,
manny , but it &apos;s very simple .
i &apos;m securely hitched to a rope ,
which means i &apos;m not going to fall .
you know , dad , you &apos;re really making
my life difficult right now.- how ?
by barking at manny like a drill sergeant
when i &apos;m trying to convince cam
that you &apos;d be a great guardian for lily .
guardian ?
yeah .
you &apos;re kidding .
jay !
yeah , never mind .
that really hurt !
this is a mistake .
why does she keep saying that ?
because they &apos;re the first words she ever heard .
here , you go first .
this will teach that skank a lesson .
shaving cream in her locker ?
just stand over there and yell if someone &apos;s coming .
she might have homework assignments in there
she hasn &apos;t handed in yet .
haley !
someone &apos;s coming !
run !
this way , this way !
okay , okay , okay !
where are we ?
boys &apos; locker room .
it smells like feet .
that &apos;s not feet . okay . come here .
i &apos;m so scared .
just go to your happy place .
we just broke into my happy place .
who &apos;s there ?
go , go , run , run !
not so loud ! run ! run !
so , how you doing ?
oh , not good . i &apos;m just glad my clown training
prepared me to take a fall like that .
yeah , and in terms of talking about it ,
are we looking at weeks , months ?
do not minimize it , you ,
who i had to rush to the emergency room
that time you fell out of your clogs .
there &apos;s your bubbly water with lemon .
thank you , jay .
how you doin &apos; ?
oh , it &apos;s hard to tell .
you know , anytime you have
a catastrophic injury to your lumbar area --
i could use a little piece of lumbar myself right now .
well , i hope you &apos;re comfortable now
making my family lily &apos;s guardians .
hola , hola !
you &apos;re forgetting about gloria .
even you have to admit how amazing she is with lily .
mm ! look who &apos;s so pretty !
oh , my god !
gloria , what did you do ?
what i told you .
you pierced her ears ? !
what i said --
i was going to make her pretty with earrings .
i thought you said &quot; hair rings . &quot;
what are hair rings ?
yes , mitchell , what are hair rings ?
something that you would tie your hair back --
she said it !
i didn &apos;t say &quot; hair rings . &quot; i said &quot; earrings . &quot;
you don &apos;t like ?
of course not . you punctured our daughter !
but did you see both sides ?
i didn &apos;t just do the gay ear .
look .
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
i actually -- i think we &apos;re good .
let &apos;s just wait in here for gabby , okay ?
oh , my god ! i can &apos;t believe we just did that .
can you believe we just did that ?
yeah , we had a lot of fun . let &apos;s not geek it up .
wait . what if i have a taste for it now ?
am i gonna start doing stuff like that all the time ?
calm down . you just did one bad thing .
two .
i skipped my cello lesson today .
that wasn &apos;t even where my teacher lives .
you ditched a class ?
well , i @-@ i didn &apos;t have time to practice
because of lacrosse and debate team and --
do you even like playing the cello ?
yeah .
alex ?
i hate it .
so quit .
i &apos;ve never quit anything .
you &apos;ve never broke into a school before .
just did that .
no offense , but the family &apos;s hopes and dreams
are kind of pinned on me .
i &apos;m just saying that no one would blame you
if you stopped being so perfect .
it actually would take a lot of pressure off of me .
i did something bad , too ...
something that nobody knows .
what ?
come here .
i can &apos;t say it too loud , okay ?
what did you do ?
phil , i &apos;m just not sure you understand
why i said what i said .
there are qualities about me you wish you could change ,
but you can &apos;t &apos; cause i &apos;m all grown up ,
but it &apos;s not too late for luke .
okay .
honey , there are a hundred things about luke
that he gets from you that i absolutely love .
it &apos;s just this -- this one tiny part
that i &apos;m sure if i could just get in there and just ... ee !
claire ... he &apos;s a great kid .
he &apos;s gonna be fine .
i know .
i think i know .
i feel terrible that we fought in front of him .
did he say anything about that on the drive here ?
how would i know ? he rode with you .
he didn &apos;t drive with me . he drove with you .
just admit it --
you want lily raised by anyone but my family .
it &apos;s just so far away from everything she knows .
and then there &apos;s the crazy aunts and the frozen cows .
oh , please , in the last hour ,
your father publicly shamed manny ,
dropped me from the sky ,
while his wife drilled holes in our baby &apos;s head .
which is why i think
we should revisit claire and phil .
where are my keys ?
we left luke alone in a parking garage !
we don &apos;t know the whole story .
don &apos;t we ?
whose car are we taking ?
mine .
then i &apos;m driving !
hey , mom .
buddy !
luke ?
buddy !
lukey ?
thank you so much .
honey , get out of there .
thank you !
i &apos;m so sorry . we are so sorry .
oh , buddy , you must &apos;ve been so scared.- no .
oh , god .
well , what happened ?
well , i knew you &apos;d come back .
then you didn &apos;t .
so i had to go find a phone .
that &apos;s when i saw a stray dog
and i played with him for a while .
then i thought i saw mrs . morgan ,
my first @-@ grade teacher , going into a church .
it wasn &apos;t her ,
but there was a wedding there .
that &apos;s where i met the litvaks .
oh , thank you ! thank you so much .
congratul-- tov .
mwah ! oh , baby .
can i go get a drink ?
yes , you can .
yes , you can ! you can drink whatever you want !
there &apos;s tons of soda in there .
what an amazing kid !
i can &apos;t believe i ever worried about him out in the world .
that &apos;s what i do , though , isn &apos;t it ? i worry .
i worry -- i think about a tiny , little thing ,
and then i obsess on it , until , suddenly ,
it &apos;s the only thing i can think about .
god , please don &apos;t let me screw up our son .
you know why else he &apos;s gonna be okay ?
no .
because somewhere out there is a worried little girl
who &apos;s making lists and labeling bins ,
and he &apos;s gonna find her .
cam ?
i know you &apos;re kind of down on jay being lily &apos;s guardian .
now , that &apos;s not anything you need to worry about , manny .
i just think you &apos;re being too hard on him .
we had a little chat in the car .
i &apos;m sorry i let you down , jay .
i &apos;m starting to think if i couldn &apos;t even get up that wall ,
then why am i even going on this
knock it off , manny .
we both know you could get up that wall .
now , why are you trying to get out of this trip ?
i &apos;m not . i &apos;m excited to go --
manny ...
okay .
i have some concerns about the shower situation .
oh . because ?
well , i &apos;m pretty much at my target weight .
that &apos;s good .
but the thing is , i haven &apos;t quite reached my target height .
got it .
all right , first of all , you don &apos;t have to go .
i &apos;ll write you a note .
we &apos;ll plan on doing something fun this weekend .
really ?
you bet .
and you &apos;re not mad at me ?
look , if you were a different kid , i &apos;d give you the speech --
you know , &quot; we all have insecurities .
you &apos;ve got to be brave here . &quot;
but let &apos;s face it --
you &apos;re already about the bravest kid i know .
i am ?
come on .
you wear blazers to school . you play the pan flute .
you -- you read poetry to girls .
i couldn &apos;t even talk to girls when i was your age .
the shower thing &apos;s nothing compared to all that .
so , whatever you decide , i &apos;m behind you .
no , i got that set up just right .
i told you about that before .
jay said that ?
yeah , and he wasn &apos;t drinking or anything .
so , what are you gonna do ?
i think i &apos;m gonna go .
i mean , if reuben can go with that extra nipple ...
i &apos;m proud of you , manny .
you &apos;re doing the right thing , trust me .
i mean , what were you thinking , gloria ?
ay , mitch , i said i was sorry .
but i had them since i was 2 -- huge ones .
what is she --
earrings , phil . earrings .
mitch , i just wanted to tell you how really touched i was
you &apos;d want me to be lily &apos;s guardian .
oh , you &apos;re welcome . and you &apos;re out .
excuse me .
i have a very important announcement to make .
oh . sorry . sorry , so rude .
totally inexcusable . yello !
mitchell and i have decided that if , god forbid ,
anything should happen to us --
you don &apos;t have to do this right now .
no .
we would like to jay and gloria to be lily &apos;s guardians .
cam ?
it &apos;s the right decision .
that is great news !
lily , when something horrible happens ,
you &apos;re going to be all mine !
it really is an &quot; if &quot; situation .
all mine !
i don &apos;t mean to ruin this really beautiful moment ,
but were phil and i even considered for the position ?
claire ?
i mean , we are the parents
of three healthy , well @-@ adjusted children who --
honey , we need to go down to the police station .
our daughters just vandalized the school .
this is not over .
let &apos;s go see your new room , liliana .
no , that &apos;s not her name .
oh , hey , what are you doing home ?
oh , i bailed on yoga .
oh , yeah , yeah .
oh , oh , could you go to the mailbox and get me --
no , why can &apos;t i just come in ?
you can . i just - - cameron ?
what ?
look at me .
i am .
what did you do ?
i am home alone for a lot of hours .
carmen miranda ?
i just wanted a couple before the holes closed up .
oh , cameron .
all right , just get one with me really quick .
