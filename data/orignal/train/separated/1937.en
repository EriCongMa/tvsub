"The Great Pretender"
Are you sure you should do that here?
We're awfully close to the road.
What are you so worried about?
What we're doing is illegal!
Just don't like doing things that are illegal.
so we just -- just dump them on the ground?
No, you -- you know, we...scatter them.
Around the campsite.
This is our spot.
Okay, pops. It's show time.
Everybody has something to hide.
We can't just expose all our secrets to the world.
It's on top shelf! In the fridge.
Hello -- I'm in here. - Oh, I know. I'm sorry.
Our shower is still busted and I got rounds.
You know what? I told him a thousand times...
...you put the bread on the counter, it molds.
You put it in the fridge, it's fine.
I'm right, right?
Okay.
Hey, do you know where the bread is?
You need to get your shower fixed!
That's how we get hurt.
It's how we risk hurting other people.
We have to decide how much we let out...
...and keep the truth to ourselves.
Hey. How'd it go with the kids?
Uh, great. Uh, they're amazing.
I just dropped them off at daycare.
Thanks again for watching them.
Yeah. How about you?
How was your weekend... in D.C...
with your husband?
It...was fun.
I'm a little exhausted, you know.
But it was the good kind of exhausted, right?
Did you even leave the bedroom?
Was he surprised? Did he freak?
Yeah, did he...freak?
Or did you just go straight
to getting frea-kay?
You know, did we even push the button, because it's just...
Hey, look who's back.
Meredith was just about to tell us
about her weekend with Derek.
Good. Tell me now so you don't show up in my bed tonight.
It's a good thing you didn't walk in on this morning.
Everyone's getting freaky but me.
Well, actually, I was just --
actually remembered I-I have to, uh -- yeah.
They totally got freaky.
And I come in this morning,
and Herman's rearranged the entire O.R. Board
with new fetal surgeries.
I used to be so good at one-night stands.
I...I missed a beat.
No, I was great at them.
And now, whenever I'm not watching Sofia,
I just sit alone at home in my pajamas.
I-I want to be out of my pajamas and not alone.
So go.
Meet someone. It's easy.
Oh, it's easy.
Well, what do you do? What's your line?
I don't use lines. I'm just honest.
What do you mean "Honest"?
I don't know.
They start with "What do you do?"
And I tell them I'm a trauma surgeon,
and they wonder why I chose that.
And I tell them I served in the war,
and I fixed soldiers on the battlefield,
And that was a...
really satisfying way to save lives.
And it still is.
Yeah, that'll do it.
You've got game, Major Hunt.
It's not a game. It's just --
Wha-- what happened to the couch?
Sorry I'm late. I'm sorry I'm late.
Three surgeries today, Robbins.
They're not gonna round on themselves.
I know. I'm on it.
Yeah, um, Wilson just barged in and stole my shower.
Edwards, does she always walk around naked?
Not around the hospital, generally.
It's like "Residents Gone Wild."
Robbins, do you live with residents?
Oh, God. Is that thing still on?
You're a grown-up. Get your own place.
I need you focused here.
Lie down, Nicole.
So, d-did Wilson just climb in the shower with you?
Yeah. No. We-- Instead of me.
Was she coming on to you?
No!
Doubtful.
You know what? Can we --
Just -- let's drop it.
"Residents Gone Wild."
Would you go?
You're making her laugh too much.
I thought you were going back to the airport.
I just couldn't get on that plane.
Thank you.
Thank you for letting me stay the weekend,
being there for me.
It was just what I needed.
I hate the circumstances, but, uh,
I'm glad it gave us a chance to reconnect.
I hear that Jackson and April are coming in today.
Have you seen him?
Catherine, he asked you to keep your distance.
And I'm honoring that request.
Look, I know how hard that is for you, okay?
But you sent food, you call for updates.
They know you're there.
I know. I just hate it.
I'll miss you.
Well, I'll -- I'll be in the O.R. anyway.
I have an open colectomy today.
I could scrub in, do your ureteral stents.
That'll give us a little more time.
I could make that happen.
Make it happen.
So, you and Meredith are getting pretty tight, huh?
What do you mean?
Well, what did she say about this weekend?
Why? Did she tell you something?
You said she told you.
No, I said she was about to tell me.
What do you think she was about to tell you?
What did she tell you?
Wasn't there a couch there?
What -- um, don't you want to say something?
This is the closest thing to a funeral.
No, dad hated funerals.
"Sprinkle me in the woods."
God, he was a pain in the ass.
Well, you can't just say that.
You know, one of his favorite memories
was taking us out here camping.
"We eat what we catch."
"We sleep in what we can carry."
Just us men.
You okay?
Maybe we should just go.
Hey, race you to the top.
Wai--
Come on. What you got? What you got?
Oh, Goodness.
It's so muggy.
It's hard to breathe.
You okay?
Hey, Curt. You should sit down.
Curt! Curt! Wha-- Curt!
Call 911!
Hey. How was your weekend?
It was nice.
She got some.
She doesn't want to talk about it.
Oh, well, I'm glad you went. I got some, too.
Definitely don't want to talk about that.
What do we got?
Curtis Warren, post syncope.
31. He's still tachycardic, diaphoretic,
and hypotensive after fainting.
But don't just stand here, Grey. Give me a hand.
Over here!
Hillary List, 27-year-old female,
found unconscious at the scene after a pretty bad tumble
down a flight of concrete stairs in the park.
Hill, honey, I'm right here.
Oh, it's all my fault.
This was your fault?
No. No, no, no, no, no.
I didn't push her. I proposed to her.
Okay, let's go to trauma two.
Fast scan is negative.
Because there's nothing wrong with me.
Any changes in your diet recently?
I told them I missed breakfast,
So I was a little woozy in the woods.
He's still mildly hypotensive after two liters.
I'm fine.
Well, there's definitely some tenderness there.
Well, run his liver enzymes and get a COAG panel.
Let's get you into this. You know what?
I'm gonna re-check that abdom--
No!
Look, I don't need to put on this stupid thing.
Would you calm down?
Look, Benji, get off me!
W-would you tell them to back off?
Okay, okay. Okay.
Family shouldn't be in here anyway.
Let's step outside.
You can change, and I will be back for you.
He's usually a sweetheart. I'll go talk to him.
Well, Bailey, he's my patient.
I'll take it. You can go.
I took her to the park.
It was, um -- it was where we had our first date,
So I thought that had a certain symmetry.
I'll order a head C.T.
And an X-ray for her right wrist and right knee.
At the top of the stairs, I got down on my knee
And I said...
"Hillary, when I met you,"
"I felt like my life blossomed with fullness."
"Like the sun had shone down on me, baby."
And that's as far as I got.
I had more, but she fainted and she fell all the way down.
I...should've caught her.
Hill? Hill? Hill? Honey? Honey.
Hey, hey, hey. It's me.
Right here. Hey, I'm here.
I'm never leaving your side.
I'll never... ever leave you.
I'll never...
Oh, she's out again.
Hill? Hill? Hillary?
Todd, uh, we're gonna admit her now.
Yeah.
So, uh, Dr. Wilson's gonna show you
where you can wait, okay?
And page Neuro.
I'm here.
Todd.
I'll just...i'm just gonna be over here, baby.
Dr. Herman, you scheduled another surgery for tomorrow?
I thought we said --
Yes, uh, the Larsen mom. Sorry.
Is this the attendings' lounge couch?
It was.
Dr. Herman, please stop making me be this guy.
You can't just steal
hospital furniture.
I need this couch.
This is the best couch in the building.
It's firm, but soft.
Bouncy.
Responsive.
Would you like to try it out?
Well, um...I-I think that's, um --
I-I-I appreciate the, um, offer, but I --
Uh, Hunt. I'm messing with you.
Larsen's gonna be a quick in and out.
9:30, O.R. Six.
Is that fine with you?
That's fine, yeah.
And, um...
Was that a "No" on trying out the couch?
Hey. So, I'm good to go?
Curt, your liver enzymes, they're off the charts.
Any idea why that might be?
I got to reminiscing about dad last night.
Maybe one too many whisky toasts.
Okay, I'm gonna get a C.T.
Oh, come on.
Listen. What are you getting at?
I ran some extra tests,
because what I was seeing wasn't making any sense.
Your lab results for a 30-year-old man are not normal,
and you had the estrogen levels of a young woman.
I just want to know what you're dealing with so I can help you.
Hillary, scans show that the fall
caused an artery under your skull to bleed.
You'll need surgery to repair it.
And then Dr. Wilson and I will repair the fracture in your knee.
But none of this explains why you passed out.
Has this ever happened before?
Fainting, dizzy spells?
No, never.
Uh, Todd said that it happened a couple of times.
You were talking on the couch and then you --
I just nodded off.
Well, I'd like to run a complete neuro work-up to find out --
Is that really necessary?
I know it's scary,
but multiple fainting spells can mean a lot of things --
Heart problems -- - It's not that.
I'm also concerned about narcolepsy, cataplexy --
No, no! There's no plexies.
I didn't faint.
Not on the couch, not on the stairs.
Okay, well, Todd said that --
I faked it.
I faked fainting when he proposed
because I didn't know how to say no
without breaking his tender, little, quivering heart.
We should scrub in together more often.
I could come to you on occasion.
I'm thinking he will need a component separation.
I'll call in a plastics consult.
No, he's fine. There's hardly any --
Page dr. Avery, please.
Uh-huh. You got it.
If there's good news and bad news,
I want the good news first.
Okay.
The good news is, a person can live without a spleen.
I'm removing yours today.
The C.T. showed your spleen is remarkably swollen.
It's probably due to a clot in the splenic vein --
Are you on drugs?
Coke or something?
Benji, come on.
'cause I'm looking at this organ damage
and I don't know what to think.
Do you have any idea what it could be, Dr. Grey?
Okay.
Curt.
Don't be stupid.
All right, if you're in trouble,
you can tell me, whatever it is.
You know that.
Ben.
You know me.
I don't do drugs.
I never have.
Can you make that call?
He wouldn't lie to me.
Drugs are off the table.
But it's something,
so try thinking like a doctor, not his --
I am thinking like a doctor.
Maybe there's a genetic component.
My father just died of colon cancer.
Maybe we start there.
I don't think it's his colon.
You got a better idea?
All right, then we start running tests.
Look, I just lost my dad, Miranda.
I'm not gonna lose my brother, too.
Just --
Okay, is this what I think it is?
What do you think it is?
I'm not blind, Grey.
My husband might be, but I'm not.
Now, he has no hair on his chest or arms.
He waxes his eyebrows.
I'd kill to have eyebrows like that.
And then I'm looking at these numbers and the splenic damage,
Is he doing what I think he's doing?
You have to ask Curt.
That zola, she could play go fish all night long.
You have a budding card shark on your hands.
Yeah, well, we eventually hide the cards.
It's the only way she'll stop.
I'll have to remember that for next time.
Look, I just want to say that, um...
I am not here to judge you, but I'm a bad liar.
So...
I don't know what you're talking about.
You packed a suitcase full of lingerie
and you went away for the weekend.
Yeah, I -- - And then derek called me three times
asking where you were.
Meanwhile, you texted me
telling me what a great time you were having,
So whatever you were doing, whoever --
He, she, they, whatever --
It wasn't with him, and that's all.
I want to be here for you,
but I like derek and I hate lying.
Oh G-- Grey! Pierce! Get in here!
Okay, okay. It's okay.
Call the O.R. Let them know we're coming now!
Oh, god, Curt!
Robbins. Let's go scrub.
Coming.
Listen, just talk to her, and -- and maybe buy her a robe.
Why would I do that?
Was this about the naked resident?
Ooh, you and Wilson, you're a thing.
You know what? Let's not.
And Robbins can get handsy with the residents.
Really?
I do not!
Last year, she got handsy.
H.R. got involved. There are policies now.
Because of you?
Robbins, that's incredible.
It's not. It -- both of you stop, okay?
Alex, it's inappropriate.
She's a resident. I'm her superior.
I'm a girl who likes girls.
It just puts us both in a very awkward position,
and you should respect that.
Well, I'm kind of down for whatever happens.
I'm gonna kill you.
Hey.
Hey.
You need to start putting on pants around the house
'cause Robbins keeps checking out your ass.
No. No. Alex, no.
You don't need to put pants on, okay?
Your ass is -- it -- fine.
See? That's reportable.
No! I...
I hate you all.
I have surgery.
This is the best day.
Oh, God, I'm awful.
There is nothing wrong with Todd.
He's -- he's nice and he's stable
And he cares for me deeply... So deeply.
And he's clingy, and he loves to --
I don't even know what to call it,
but he likes to... pet me.
It's really soft, and it
He's boring.
So, I just started doing this thing
where I pretend to faint so he'll stop talking.
Wow, that is...
Diabolical.
Why don't you just tell him the truth?
Because it would kill him.
I mean, he wants to take things to the next level,
but the more that he feels, the less I do.
And then today, we were in the park,
and he got down on one knee
and he looked up at me with his big wet eyes,
so I just -- - Faked it.
I didn't realize how close I was to the steps.
But I had to go with it all the way down.
You can really commit.
Yeah.
But not to Todd.
Shepherd, how's Herman?
Any changes to the tumor?
Oh, it's grown a little inferiorly.
Uh, but it's still within the margins I expected.
Why?
I was just checking.
Actually, um...
Her behavior is --
She's stealing furniture.
And...she was flirting with me.
Herman flirted with you?
I think so.
I...yeah.
Did you take her up on it?
I mean, she's very attractive.
No. Uh, yes, she -- she is, bu--
And tall.
I mean, she might be the tallest person in the hospital.
You might find tall people attractive.
I don't know.
No, I don't.
Not as a rule,
but professionally, it's not a good idea.
Is that a rule?
No co-workers?
Didn't say that.
I-I like co-workers.
I-I -- but the -- the hospital, we have rules
that are, um...
Thank you for the update.
You wanted a consult?
Not me.
Me.
Mom.
I asked you to go.
I need you to take a look at this incision, sweetheart.
She's not just trying to check on me and April?
Don't look at me. I got played, too.
They just took him in.
How the hell did this happen?
He was sitting up and talking to me an hour ago.
Well, we knew about the spleen.
It made his stomach muscles bleed,
But Pierce will clip them and Grey --
You were right. You were right about the drugs.
I-I didn't want to believe it at first, but it's obvious.
He -- he's using.
Okay, now, we shouldn't jump --
I'll get him in rehab.
As soon as he can walk out of here, I'm go--
Ben, wait.
What do you think it is? Coke? Crystal?
Come on, y-you're usually right about these things.
Tell me.
I think...
You should talk to Curt.
Is there -- there something you're not telling me?
After surgery, he'll tell you everything.
Tell me what? Miranda.
Just talk to him. He'll --
But what if I don't get the chance to?
What -- what if he doesn't come out of surgery?
Oh, that's nonsense. Now, just calm down.
Calm down?
I'm being lied to by my brother,
and now I'm being lied to by my wife.
I'm not lying to you.
Well, no one's telling me the damn truth!
I'll tell you!
It's only because when he tells you,
you need to react better than this, Ben Warren.
What is it?
Okay, Curt is...
Curt is transitioning.
He...
She is transgender.
And she identifies as female,
and she wants to live life as a woman.
Your brother is becoming your sister.
Oh, my god.
Oh -- oh, that son of a bitch.
He -- he put you up to this.
Bleeding is controlled.
Clamping the hilum. Suture ligature.
So, what did you say when he called?
The first time, I said that you were in the shower.
Ligating the gastric vessels.
The second time, I said you were taking a nap.
And the third time,
I said Hunt called you in for an emergent rectal abscess.
I hate lying.
I didn't want to spoil anything.
I need to dissect the splenorenal ligament.
Metz.
Hey, okay.
Pierce just controlled the gastric bleeds with clips,
and now Grey is finishing taking out the spleen.
All right, now, um -- he's upset about dad.
He's obviously having some sort of emotional breakdown,
so we'll get him a psych consult.
No, we won't.
Curt's crazy. This makes no sense.
All right, the only thing that does make sense right now
is that after the surgery, you will talk to Curt...
and you will listen to Curt tell you her good news,
and it is good news.
And you will listen,
and you will tell her that you love her
and tell her that you'll always be here for her.
Okay, so after the fetoscope is inserted,
then I will deploy the shunt,
and you'll manipulate the camera, right?
You're a hypocrite.
I beg your pardon?
You, uh, were so high and mighty when I was boffing Graham.
Which one was it? Which resident did you sully?
Oh, god. I knew that you would...
You can't suddenly become interesting and then clam up.
It -- it was a year ago, and she's gone now.
Weren't you married last year?
Yes.
No. Well, we -- we were broken up.
I thought you just split.
This was a different ti--
I cheated on Callie, okay?
Oh, my god.
How have you been hiding this from me?
Hiding what?
The dirt. You're dirty.
And here I thought you were no fun at all.
Oh, stop it. I'm --
You're a dirty, dirty girl.
You're dirty.
Minimal swelling. I like that.
Hey, can I get an E.T.A on when you're closing
just so I can prep the leg?
One last vessel here.
So, she threw herself down a flight of stairs
just to avoid telling him yes or no?
Mm-hmm.
Have you met the boyfriend?
Wilson, go let him know that her brain surgery was successful.
Bring tissues.
Oh. Poor guy.
Poor guy?
I'm sewing her brain shut right now.
Oh, Todd's the problem here?
Why? 'cause he cares too much?
He feels too much?
He's -- he's willing to devote himself fully
to another person. That's the problem?
If it makes the other person want to pass out, yeah.
Well, then that's it.
That's why I can't pick people up anymore,
because I don't know how to put them back down.
That's why I have no game.
I used to have game.
I had such game.
Yeah?
I used to be fun and cool and sexy and go to bars
and do this thing where you make eye contact once
and look away.
Just reel them in without a word.
Such game.
Hey, what was your secret?
Drugs.
I was on drugs.
So, I'm leaving out
the terrible, terrible repercussions,
but ever since I got off the drugs, I've gotten worse.
Now I'm just all mumbling and vomiting words
and no cool, no sexy, no game at all.
Same here. Game over.
I want to be clear -- I am in no way
endorsing narcotics as a dating aid.
Understood.
So, dinner's coming?
Yes, mom.
You still haven't told me. How's April?
Mom, she's all right.
And I'm fine.
We're doing okay.
I don't believe that for one second.
Mom, what do you want me to say?
Mom, she's sad, obviously.
April is angry, okay?
About the baby, about god.
She just needs her space.
And I can't help her.
I just make her crazy,
which just makes me feel useless.
She doesn't need space so much as the illusion of space.
You should do what I do.
Stay out of her way, but not too far.
Find something else to occupy your mind.
Work is good.
Now, be close, but just out of sight.
And you'll be there for her when she's ready.
Okay, I'm pretty sure what you just described is stalking.
Your abdominal closure should be fine.
Is that what this weekend was for you?
Something else to occupy your mind?
I'm not cheating on my husband.
Then where were you?
It's really not that big a deal.
Then why are you being so weird about it?
You have to tell me something.
I have to?
I lied for you.
I'm sorry if I put you in a position
where you felt like you had to lie for me,
but that doesn't make this any of your business.
Okay, maybe not.
I just
I thought we were finally getting somewhere.
You trusted me with your kids.
I trust my babysitter with my kids.
That doesn't mean I owe her my life story.
Pierce, I'm sorry.
No. No, it's fine. It's fine.
That came out wrong.
You're right.
Just do me a favor.
Next time, call your babysitter.
Leave me out of it.
Oh, there she is. Are you all right?
How is she? Is she all well again?
She's gonna be fine. Both surgeries went very well.
Thank you. Thank --
Thank you.
Hill. I'm gonna take you home.
I'm gonna make sure that you have
everything you need, all right?
You tell him right now.
Todd.
You have been so sweet,
and you have been so kind,
and I have been unfair to you.
No, No.
No, don't worry about me.
I love you. I'm right here.
And I'm never leaving you.
Ever.
Oh, Hillary. Hillary?
Hillary?!
She fainted!
Help her!
For god sake.
She can't take another fall like that.
Todd, what Hillary's trying to tell you
is that she wants to break up with you.
What?
I'm so sorry.
I know that all you want is to help her,
but she doesn't want that.
She doesn't deserve it. She's faking this right now.
What?
Todd.
You deserve someone who wants you there, you know?
Um, someone who needs the kind of attention
that only you can give,
and it's not gonna be Hillary, okay, and it shouldn't be.
And you will be fine... without her,
and it may take a while to find the right person,
but you will find her.
You should start looking, okay?
She's right.
Don't waste another minute. Start right now.
There.
Thank you.
Just -- just tell me, where's this all coming from?
It's coming from me. This is who I am.
Since when?
I mean, what, you just suddenly decided --
Benji, I've known since I was 5.
5?
Because, you know, I wanted to play for the bears when I was 5
because you don't know crap when you're 5.
I knew this.
Yeah, but why didn't I know it?
We shared a room for 18 years.
You ever have that dream where you're pushed out on stage
and everybody knows their lines except you?
And you're in some costume
or you're naked or -- or whatever.
And you're just trapped there.
You can't...
That was my whole life.
Every day of my life, pretending.
Benji, I'm tired of pretending.
I just want to be happy with who I am.
Can you understand that?
So, now you give a damn about what I think?
Now suddenly it matters that I understand?
You know it does.
I'm -- I'm just supposed to be okay with this?
I-I'm just supposed to accept this?
Wa--wai--
Okay, I'll go talk to him.
Don't bother.
How soon do you think I can get out of here?
I don't imagine you need a ride to the airport.
I have a car.
What are you doing?
You scrub in with me, you take over the O.R.
so you can call your son on a phony consult?
I needed to know how he was doing.
I'm talking about us.
What about us, Richard?
It looks like you got what you wanted
and you're running out the door.
You used me.
I seem to recall your saying I use people all the time --
Cristina Yang, the Harper Avery.
So, why are you so surprised now?
I was angry when I said those things.
And I was angry when I heard them.
I thought after the last few days, I...
I thought we'd moved on from that.
Richard, you were here for me in a terrible time.
I appreciate that, but I'm still me,
and you're not okay with who I am.
One minute, you find a powerful woman attractive,
the next minute, your feelings are hurt.
You can't have it both ways.
You're gonna have to figure that out
before we move on anywhere.
I went to the airport, I got through security,
I went up to the gate,
they called my boarding group, and I just stood there.
I froze. I didn't get on the plane.
I watched the plane take off from behind the glass...
...I got in my car, and I left.
Oh, Meredith.
I didn't know how to tell anyone...
...that I didn't get on the plane to visit my husband.
So, I drove to one of those hotels by the airport.
And you stayed there by yourself all weekend?
You were embarrassed, so you hid.
I...I kind of get that.
Well, it's -- - No, no, it's okay.
You don't have to say another word.
That must've been awful.
Those cheap hotel rooms are horrible.
You must felt terrible and lonely and embarrassed...
...and I just made it worse by bugging you...
asking you questions when I should've just...
I totally understand why you didn't tell me.
I wouldn't have told anybody, either.
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.
But thank you... for telling me.
Thank you for understanding.
Benjamin Warren, I'm so disappointed in you.
She's your family.
I get it, okay?
You're so evolved,
so tolerant and quick to adjust.
And I'm just a -- a dumb caveman.
Well, you don't have to be.
25 years Miranda.
I counted them up today.
that's how long we either shared a bedroom
or an apartment or a damn tent in the woods.
It's a long time for this not to come up, don't you think?
She wasn't ready.
If this was anyone else, there wouldn't even be an issue...
...but I told him everything.
From my first crush --
Kahlia Hogg, fourth grade --
the night I proposed to the gorgeous Miranda Bailey.
And everything in between.
I had to tell Curt.
First thing, always.
But now he -- he's got the biggest thing in his life...
...and he waited 25 years to tell me.
How's that supposed to make me feel?
Well, this isn't about you, Ben.
It's her song.
So get off the stage, let her sing it.
No, could you please stop with that?
I feel like it was all a lie,
You know?
Our whole life...
he lied to me.
Well, Curt needs your help now.
Well, it's -- it's a little late to ask.
Should've asked 25 years ago.
Mnh-mnh. I'm -- I'm done with him.
Her.
Curt.
Um, this is Dr. Avery.
He's a plastic surgeon.
Um, you might want to hear him out.
It's -- it's your call.
You have a name yet?
Guessing you're not sticking with Curtis.
Rosalind.
That's a beautiful name.
So, can I call you Rosalind then?
'cause I don't know what we're waiting for.
Hey, I'm Jackson.
Now, let's go over some ground rules.
First, those off-shelf hormone treatments you're taking --
No. Those are over.
From now on, everything that goes in your body
is approved and regulated by this hospital.
Understood?
Absolutely.
Okay.
You see a therapist?
Not for a while.
Okay. Well, it's time to start again.
So, we'll get started with a full medical history.
You know, I used to be fun.
I used to skate around the halls of this hospital.
Why don't you?
My bad.
I used to go dancing.
I used to...
...flirt and be flirted with.
Now I live in a house full of naked people
and all of my friends are her friends,
and all I have is work and I never want to go home.
I had a busy, busy life.
I sat on all these boards --
Pacific Ballet, Seattle Opera.
Whatever was very important to my ex.
Used to be so worried about what he thought of me,
what my peers thought, what everybody thought.
But now I do what I want, when I want,
and it's sweet.
I have to tell you, Robbins,
my life is so much better now that I have nothing.
I mean, I can't recommend a tumor,
but you should try it.
You should go home.
I am home.
Why do you think I stole this couch?
We can't waste a minute.
I'm gonna stay here until, uh...
until it's over.
Whatever that means.
Then I'll stay with you tonight.
You should know...
I'm not gonna have sex with you.
Sh-shut up!
Y--
Sorry.
Do you drink wine?
I just wanted to visit,
and people bring wine sometimes when they're...
...going to visit another person.
Especially if they have --
They bring a bottle.
That's -- that's water.
So...
Because I don't drink wine.
I -- I don't drink at all.
Not anymore.
So, I brought water, and...
I'm sorry.
I have literally no game.
I should go. It's sparkling.
Lime.
Just wanted to say hi.
Hey, do you want some water?
Not thirsty.
Okay, wait.
Amelia.
Stop walking.
I'm gonna kiss you now, so don't -- don't say anything.
It's scary to reveal everything about ourselves.
And now you can go home.
I'm just -- um -- now I'm gonna -- I'm gonna go home.
Which is... that way.
Fear makes us hold ourselves back.
Is that so wrong?
Okay, this is taking too long.
Dance with me.
Okay.
Okay.
Maybe. Probably.
But still...
...it helps to be a little sneaky,
a little protective.
It's not safe to just blurt out all of our secrets.
Never got on the plane. I never went to D.C.
Now you want to blab.
Where's Pierce?
What is she -- morning shift? I get nights?
I went to a hotel.
What? With who? Do I know him?
No. By myself.
You didn't want to see Derek?
I did. Too much.
What if I got off the plane and he wasn't happy to see me?
What if he didn't smile?
That would be bad.
That would mean it's done, it's over.
So what? You just head out alone?
I mean, why didn't you just come back?
I was going to.
And then...I didn't.
And it was amazing.
It was just me for three days.
All by myself.
I wasn't anybody's wife or doctor or mother.
And I kind of liked it.
If I had gone to D.C., we would've fought
or we would've talked about fighting,
And I don't want to talk anymore.
I don't want to fight anymore.
Alex.
I don't want to leave him.
But I definitely do not want to be with him right now.
We can't just lay all the truth out there...
...expose ourselves to God and everybody.
Hey, have you seen my -- oh!
Oh. A little warning...
...when people are over would be nice.
I told her to wear pants.
I don't have to wear pants.
It's perfectly fine if I don't wear pants.
Doesn't make me stupid.
'cause once the truth is out...
I'm gonna marry that girl.
...we have to face it ourselves.
I don't know what's gonna happen with us.
