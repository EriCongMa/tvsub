happy st. valentine &apos;s day , mates .
i just spent the week at ryan &apos;s , and it was absolutely lovely .
fake accent , smug attitude--
this is exactly why the teachers have turned on jyan .
jyan ? ! come on !
you chose the worst parts of both our names .
that &apos;s why we chose it .
haters gonna &quot; h. &quot;
that &apos;s why ryan has to find a new job .
you know , i hear elijah wood &apos;s looking for a stunt double .
he &apos;s so small !
get back in that tree and make me some cookies , ryan !
cookies ! yeah !
i know , so hot , right ?
anyway , what &apos;s going on in your little lives ?
well , i &apos;m just enjoying the fruits of dating
a semi @-@ powerful local politician .
tonight , it &apos;s a valentine &apos;s day
cardiologists &apos; soiree .
check that out . oh !
oh , my goodness .
is that the invitation ?
wait , that &apos;s a real heart ?
looks like meat .
it &apos;s not shaped like this ?
yeah , well , you know ,
the cardiologists feel
that the traditional cartoon heart , uh ...
promotes ignorance .
that &apos;s gross .
where &apos;s nick ? how is he handling the breakup with kai ?
i don &apos;t know-- i haven &apos;t seen fat fat fatty in a long time .
yeah , me , either .
yeah , i haven &apos;t seen him since the breakup .
you live in the same room as him .
i &apos;ve been crashing in your room while you &apos;re away .
is nick missing ?
no , he is not .
oh , boy . hey .
oh , wow .
you look terrible .
hey , nick . are you covered in gravy ?
nope . i &apos;ve been in my room for the last week sleeping
and thinking
and really getting into the comic strip cathy .
oh , i &apos;m really excited that we can finally talk about cathy .
when she &apos;s mad , she says , &quot; ack . &quot;
ack .
ack .
ack !
nick , why would you come out here ?
sounds like you were doing pretty good in there .
doug &apos;s ale house .
the new bar on sixth and spring ?
no .
the exact coordinates to complete my bar crawl
that i &apos;ve been working on for almost a decade .
mmm . what ? !
ooh .
big day .
thanks .
and guess what ? good news .
it &apos;s tonight ! who &apos;s in ?
oh ...
you know , i &apos;m on call at the station tonight ,
so i can &apos;t really drink , so ...
fawn &apos;s speaking at a cardiologist event .
ryan and i have a reservation at a really fancy restaurant , so ...
you &apos;re probably thinking ,
&quot; oh , a bar crawl on valentine &apos;s day--
is this about nick &apos;s breakup with kai ? &quot; no .
yeah .
now you might be asking yourself ,
&quot; is attendance really mandatory ? &quot;
you bet it is .
bar crawl !
he &apos;s about to crack . we have to go tonight .
so i have news about a bar cr ...
was i just out here talking to you guys about the bar crawl ?
did i already pitch it all to you ?
well , it &apos;s happening tonight !
okay , so we hit six bars in five hours .
wait , wouldn &apos;t six hours make more sense ?
yeah , that &apos;d make sense &apos; cause it all divides ...
no , no , it doesn &apos;t , because it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s five hours .
now , the amazing thing is ,
if you connect all the coordinates , the six bars
form a perfect smiley face on the map-- look .
you didn &apos;t actually connect all the coordinates .
oh , my ...
hey , i think
it is a really cool smiley face .
thank you .
i got your back , man . i got your back .
actually , i have all your backs , all right ?
uh , since i can &apos;t drink tonight , i am your designated buddy .
here in my backpack , i have a list of items
that we may need .
i got water , so ...
i got towels for everybody .
perfect .
i got ... small stick .
speaks for itself . oh .
oh . also ... one female condom .
it &apos;s gonna go quick , so i &apos;ll let you two fight it out .
uh @-@ uh . also , i got tissues for you , nick ,
&apos;cause ...
what for ?
it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s valentine &apos;s day , and your girlfriend broke up .
you guys can be sad ...
move it right along , man .
cool it . and the bar crawl starts ...
now !
now !
actually , where &apos;s schmidt ?
well , it &apos;s with a heavy heart ...
oh ! ... that we really must leave you .
we really must . he &apos;s too much .
it was a pleasure .
pleasure .
easy on the puns , okay ?
and you &apos;ve got broccoli in your teeth .
remember what i told you about eating at public functions ?
only use your back teeth .
only use your back teeth .
hey , fawn , i &apos;m sorry . we should probably get
to nick &apos;s bar crawl now , yeah ?
you remember ? i confirmed it like ten times with your intern .
yes , yes , yes , no .
first , i need to , uh , schmooze some vascular surgeons .
gotta get a discount on my spider vein removal . okay ?
okay , ten minutes tops .
we &apos;re still going to dinner , &apos; cause it took a lot to get this reservation .
also , we can &apos;t get wasted
&apos;cause it &apos;s a very nice restaurant .
which means we have to pretend to drink in front of nick .
is that really necessary ?
oh , yakkety @-@ yakkety @-@ yak .
don &apos;t ruin my bar crawl .
let &apos;s go . drink .
boom !
i &apos;m gonna outdrink you tonight , miller .
cece , your mouth is writing a check
that your body can &apos;t find .
that &apos;s not an expression .
regionally specific to northern illinois .
we say it all the time .
thank you , winston .
you &apos;re welcome .
don &apos;t write a check your body can &apos;t find .
every day , man .
for real . got to . got to .
a gimlet for may .
thank you .
watch and learn , player .
if you &apos;re a girl
and you &apos;re in a bar on valentine &apos;s day ,
you &apos;re basically saying , &quot; hello . good february .
i &apos;m interested in casual sex . &quot;
may , huh ?
that &apos;s your name ?
yeah .
ah , that &apos;s crazy &apos; cause , uh ...
i know i just met you ,
but your name &apos;s already written ... on my heart .
it &apos;s fate , baby .
it &apos;s fate-- seriously ?
all right , come on !
five @-@ minute warning , let &apos;s go .
dude , i &apos;m kind of in the middle of something .
oh , no , nope , you &apos;re in the middle of nothing ,
because that &apos;s the cheesiest thing i &apos;ve ever seen .
she hates you , ernie .
but i don &apos;t like her for you , anyway . let &apos;s go .
wait , what do you mean ?
i just don &apos;t know what to do .
no schools are hiring .
i &apos;ve contacted everyone i know .
i even checked through all my contacts in england ,
including my old headmaster at wellington prep ,
to see if he knew of anything in the states .
* where there &apos;s a will *
* there &apos;s a wellington way . *
how do you know the wellington fight song ?
you sing it in your sleep .
oh , god .
look , don &apos;t worry ,
you &apos;re gonna find a job .
i &apos;m just worried about not seeing you
as much if i switch schools . well ...
i &apos;ll just have to sleep over more .
or you could move in with me .
did the music just get louder ?
the crawl rolls on
and winston &apos;s got the rear !
let &apos;s go !
let &apos;s go .
let &apos;s go , let &apos;s go , let &apos;s go .
let &apos;s go with the backpack in the back of the pack .
hey , so listen , can &apos;t make the crawl . bummed .
what ?
but remember-- tomorrow we have that photo shoot ,
and i &apos;m gonna need you to look as mexican
as possible , okay ?
it &apos;s not okay . we should be together .
it &apos;s valentine &apos;s day .
come on , you don &apos;t really care
about valentine &apos;s day , do you ?
i don &apos;t know , maybe i do .
plus , you owe me .
i ran the teleprompter at your last debate--
i made &quot; fawn is fine &quot;
bumper stickers on my own dime .
yeah . even krumped at that anti @-@ gang initiative .
yeah , i have mixed feelings about that .
me , too . the point is , yeah .
i &apos;m tired of always doing your things .
what do you want ? you want a ... you want a photo op ?
or do you want a boyfriend ?
call me when you know what you want .
yeah , okay .
this bar completes the eyes
on my smiley face .
miller , man , it &apos;s just an honor
to be on this bar crawl with you .
just serving your vision .
are you guys going on a bar crawl ?
i just got dumped , so this holiday
is really kicking me in the penis .
me , too , man . me , too .
it &apos;s been a real kick in the gooch .
not anymore , it &apos;s not .
&apos;cause you &apos;re joining us .
valentine &apos;s day
might be for couples ,
but the crawl is for all .
yes .
we just got our motto , folks .
the bar crawl is for all !
good evening , happy valentine &apos;s day .
may i offer you a piece of my hear-- ?
you again .
i &apos;m curious , d @-@ do you actually think that &apos;s gonna work ?
i mean , you tell me .
are you trolling bars on valentine &apos;s day
trying to find sad single girls to hook up with you ?
i &apos;m not gonna say yes , and i &apos;m not gonna say no .
because i know it would be a lie .
so yes .
i &apos;m gonna ...
i &apos;m gonna take these .
don &apos;t !
yep . paid $ 3.50 for those .
you owe me $ 3.50 .
i don &apos;t know , it &apos;s just such a huge step
and so early in the relationship , and i thought
that i could skip the question
and come back to it later ,
which is the strategy i taught my s.a.t. prep course .
all right , let &apos;s do pros and cons .
okay , pros-- i love him .
i love his house , i love his accent .
when he says &quot; raccoon &quot; he says it like &quot; rac @-@ coon . &quot;
adorable .
cons ...
his toaster is super @-@ old .
ugh ! i tried to stay out of this ,
but move in with him !
yeah , well , i @-@ i want to move in with him , but ...
no &quot; but , &quot; there &apos;s no damn &quot; but . &quot;
no &quot; but . &quot;
but ...
what if i blew it by pretending i didn &apos;t hear him ?
or maybe it wasn &apos;t that obvious .
nah , she heard me , it was very obvious .
i really hate to see you upset .
you know , if i had something to g ...
you know what , i do have something .
i have a bag of nuts in my bag .
do you want a bag of nuts ?
maybe she didn &apos;t hear you .
you know , she &apos;s got a lot of hair .
and hair blocks sound .
it happened when we were dating all the time .
hey , did you get a chance to read
my walking dead fan fiction , yet ?
what &apos;d you think ?
well , here &apos;s the good news , lad .
we have a solution .
it &apos;s god &apos;s gift to man .
it &apos;s alcohol .
i can &apos;t .
we agreed to pretend @-@ drink so we could go out to dinner .
are you saying that &apos; cause you want me
to go to jail for murder ?
no .
no , &apos; cause i &apos;m gonna murder you
if you &apos;re pretend @-@ drinking on my bar crawl !
and you &apos;re breaking my heart !
you can &apos;t fight the crawl .
it &apos;s like fighting a hurricane .
you know what a hurricane is ?
do you guys have those over the pond ?
we don &apos;t , but i know what it is .
you guys don &apos;t have them ?
no .
they &apos;re awful .
it &apos;s like fighting one of those .
and a hurricane doesn &apos;t have fists ,
so just , bang , you lose !
let &apos;s drink .
yeah , man .
yeah !
usa !
usa !
yeah ! usa !
usa !
and also where you &apos;re from !
to show respect .

that rests between his eyes ,
and he can drink forever and ever and ever .
you &apos;ll lose every time .
hey , it &apos;s my business partner
that i was telling you about-- schmidt !
schmidt !
nick , who are all these people ?
these are the crawlers .
the single , the lonely , the close @-@ talkers ,
the shockingly pale , the stank @-@ mouths ,
fat boys in the back ...
the chubby @-@ fronts ,
the delusionally @-@ okay with themselves ...
but no one is alone tonight because ...
the crawl is for all !
the crawl is for all ! the crawl is for all !
i just want chicken wings .

valentine &apos;s day just sucks .
i don &apos;t know . i kind of like it .

since a few years ago-- since three years ago , to be exact .
oh , what happened three ... ?
it was when you first took a chance on me .
and we humped until the sun came out .
did all the things that r. kelly raps about .
yeah , i know . i was there .
it was the best night of my life ,
and ever since then ,
valentine &apos;s day has always been my favorite holiday ,
and i hope that you don &apos;t remember
that i have said any of these things tomorrow .
oh , it &apos;s gonna happen again .
it &apos;s gonna ... oh .
it &apos;s gonna happen again .
all right . oh ...
somehow , this isn &apos;t repulsive .
it &apos;s not great , but it certainly isn &apos;t the worst .
i &apos;m so sorry that i pretended not to hear you .
it &apos;s just that ... i wasn &apos;t ready for it ,
and sometimes you mumble with your accent ,
and i never fully understand you .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry .
i asked you to move in with me out of the blue .
what kind of ... nutter does that ?
the craziest mother nutter in the whole damn place !

and &apos; cause you &apos;re dangerous .
i can &apos;t believe i used to have a crush on you .
hey , man . how &apos;s it going ?
i &apos;m not hooking up tonight .
i met one girl .
several times .
she &apos;s pretty much perfect .
nice . where &apos;s she at ?
i ditched her , dude .
she &apos;s , like , relationship material .
that &apos;s not what i &apos;m looking for tonight .

i got something just for that .
you &apos;re gonna love it . here it is .
i can &apos;t wait .
give it to me right ...
go get that girl , dude .
i don &apos;t even know where she is .
i didn &apos;t hit you that hard .
this , uh , schmidt &apos;s jacket you &apos;re wearing ?
yeah .
not to be a nosy buddy ,
but sparks are flying
like the wright brothers between you two .
and i would know .
i have their biography here in my backpack .
i care about schmidt , but just as a friend , all right ?
look me in the eyes ,
and tell me you don &apos;t have feelings for schmidt .
i don &apos;t have feelings for him .
dude , you are nowhere near my eyes .
nobody hit on me . i &apos;m taken .
don &apos;t talk to me . i &apos;m a councilwoman .
schmidt ?
did the whole crawl to find you .
i &apos;m cold , i &apos;m tired , i &apos;m sober .
i &apos;m wearing my strapless bra like a belt .
but i know what i want .
i want you .
i want you to be my boyfriend .
as much as a i want a commuter lane to costa mesa !
vote moscato !
what ?
they &apos;re kissing .
i thought maybe you were gonna say something like ,
&quot; no &quot; or , like , &quot; i miss him so much now . &quot;
last call !
we got one more bar on the crawl !
we have to finish the smile !
you &apos;re never ever gonna make it .
and i &apos;m never gonna ride a jet ski
with tom colicchio on my back .
so , sometimes dreams just don &apos;t come true .
i &apos;m sorry about that guy galecky
not hugging you from behind in the water
on a motorized thing-- i &apos;m sorry !
we will finish what we have started !
we will feast on the spoils
of this night for a thousand moons !
in the name of love and booze !
oh , no . my crush is back .
i hate myself .
oh , this person will not stop texting me .
where is it ?
sorry .
oh , it &apos;s an e @-@ mail from wellington prep .

so , you &apos;d be the headmaster ?
headmaster .
of wellington ?
of wellington .
headmaster .
jess ... look at me .
i &apos;m not gonna take it .
wellington &apos;s not even that great .
you have their current headmaster
as your emergency contact .
okay , it &apos;s heaven on earth .
and i love it .
but i love you more .
well , i love you , which is why i can &apos;t
let you pass up this opportunity !
if we were ready to live in the same place ,
then we should be ready
to live 5,000 miles apart .
yeah , i suppose , but ...
well , i &apos;ll call you every night after work .
it &apos;ll only be , like , midnight your time .
i could learn to stay up late . maybe i should try cocaine !
yeah ! or coffee !
that , too .
and i &apos;ll come and visit .
it &apos;s only , like , an 11 @-@ hour flight .
and then a four @-@ hour drive to wellington .
that &apos;s so long !
which is great ... &apos; cause i can catch up on podcasts .
we can do this !
we can do this long distance , right ?
