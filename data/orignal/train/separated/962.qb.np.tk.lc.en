carlos revealed his deepest desire . &lt; / i &gt;
it &apos;s about children . i want them so bad .
tom forced the issue . &lt; / i &gt;
are you sleeping with my wife ?
of course not .
rick came clean . &lt; / i &gt;
i have feelings for you . i know you feel something for me .
you can &apos;t work here anymore .
and susan &apos;s tortured love life ... &lt; / i &gt;
i was on my way to propose to you .
... was finally ... &lt; / i &gt;
what would you have said ? &lt; / i &gt;
... on the mend . &lt; / i &gt;
exactly one year had passed since the night mike delfino &lt; / i &gt;
and susan mayer were supposed to become engaged . &lt; / i &gt;
so when mike took susan to her favorite restaurant , &lt; / i &gt;
she just knew he was going to pop the question . &lt; / i &gt;
what are you gonna have ?
and when he did ... &lt; / i &gt;
the chicken .
... she &apos;d be ready with her answer . &lt; / i &gt;
but as the evening wore on , &lt; / i &gt;
the moment susan had been waiting for ... &lt; / i &gt;
... failed to materialize . &lt; / i &gt;
and though many opportunities presented themselves ... &lt; / i &gt;
... the question was never asked . &lt; / i &gt;
until the thought began to dawn on susan , &lt; / i &gt;
that perhaps ... &lt; / i &gt;
... it never would . &lt; / i &gt;
you &apos;re pretty quiet over there . was dinner ok ?
if by &quot; ok &quot; you mean uneventful , then yes .
something on your mind ?
mike , what day is today ?
wednesday .
yes .
it &apos;s also the anniversary of the day
we were supposed to get engaged .
a year ago tonight , you were on your way to ask me
to marry you when you got hit by that stupid car .
that was a year ago ? time really flies .
is that all you have to say ?
why are you getting mad ?
i thought you were gonna propose tonight !
susan , why would i want to commemorate the anniversary
of the night that some maniac put me in a coma ?
because this date has special meaning for us .
i sat in front of that trailer for six hours
thinking you hated me ,
and a proposal would &apos;ve brought the entire thing full circle .
it &apos;d have turned a bad memory into a beautiful one .
you really thought this through , didn &apos;t you ?
yes , i did . because i am a thoughtful person .
and whenever we do get married ,
that is something you are gonna have to work on .
i &apos;ll do my best .
by the way ... does that seem familiar ?
oh , my god . i can &apos;t believe that you did this .
well , i wanted to ... how &apos;d you put it ?
... turn a bad memory into a beautiful one .
now go sit in front of that trailer .
i promise i &apos;ll show up this time .
yes , susan knew mike was about to pop the question , &lt; / i &gt;
the one she thought he &apos;d never ask . &lt; / i &gt;
oh , mike ...
and thanks to susan ... &lt; / i &gt;
will you marry me ?
... he never did . &lt; / i &gt;
luckily , it wasn &apos;t the question she needed to hear ... &lt; / i &gt;
i kind of had a speech prepared , but sure , what the heck ?
... it was the answer . &lt; / i &gt;
from the moment we wake up in the morning ... &lt; / i &gt;
what time is it ?
... till our head hits the pillow at night ... &lt; / i &gt;
did you lock the front door ?
our lives are filled with questions . &lt; / i &gt;
did you remember to buy more shaving cream ?
simple ones that are easy to answer . &lt; / i &gt;
can i still pull this look off ?
but some questions are so dangerous , &lt; / i &gt;
the truth is not an option . &lt; / i &gt;
are you mad at daddy ?
no . why would you think that ?
because you &apos;re not talking to him .
well , when two people have known each other as long as
mommy and daddy have , they don &apos;t have to always talk .
in fact ,
a sign of a good relationship is being comfortable in silence .
that &apos;s true .
although , mommy ignoring me last night at work
wasn &apos;t what i &apos;d call comfortable .
well , daddy probably didn &apos;t notice that
i was unloading 20 @-@ pound bags of flour
&apos;cause he still can &apos;t lift them .
mommy didn &apos;t have time to sit around and chew the fat .
well , you haven &apos;t wanted to chew the fat for five days now .
come on . lynette , something &apos;s obviously bugging you .
you wanna know what &apos;s bugging me ?
i &apos;m trying to have breakfast with my family
and you &apos;re picking a fight .
who &apos;s fighting , i just want to talk !
there &apos;s nothing to talk about , ok ? just leave me alone .
fine .
good .
sorry i asked .
hey , francois , it &apos;s susan mayer .
call me as soon as you get this .
i know i told you my wedding was off , but it &apos;s back on ,
and i wanna see if you &apos;re still available to do the flowers .
bye . oh , just so you know ,
ian &apos;s not the groom anymore . long story . call me .
there , i think i &apos;ve left messages for everyone .
are you sure it &apos;s ok for us to have the same wedding
i was planning with ian ? be honest .
well , i stole his bride , i guess i can poach his florist .
gosh , i just keep thinking
there &apos;s someone i &apos;ve forgotten to tell .
caterer , band , florist ...
um , guests ?
oh , my god !
i had julie call and cancel everyone .
just call them back .
you can &apos;t invite people to a wedding on the phone !
you have to send a proper invitation .
want people to think i &apos;m a complete flake ?
hi , curt , it &apos;s susan meyer .
you did my wedding invitations .
i &apos;m gonna need another batch .
exactly the same , only change the name
&quot; ian hainsworth &quot; to &quot; mike delfino . &quot;
long story . call me .
what &apos;s with the frown ?
you trying to get wrinkles before the wedding ?
no , i can &apos;t find a good flower girl .
lynette &apos;s keep hinting for me to use penny ,
but i saw her in that pre @-@ school sing @-@ along ,
and i &apos;m sorry , but we &apos;re talking zero charisma .
you know , i had a thought about the flower girl .
you did ?
my cleaning lady has a daughter . where &apos;s that picture ?
look familiar ?
oh , my god , she looks just like me when i was that age .
that &apos;s what i thought . this way , the wedding procession
starts with you as this beautiful girl ,
ends with you as the stunning bride you &apos;ve become .
i love that you &apos;re so into this wedding .
most men would be like ,
&quot; yeah , yeah . tell me where the church is . &quot;
but you &apos;re as obsessed as me .
like a hot groom and a gay best friend all rolled into one .
well , can you blame me
for wanting to make everything as perfect as you ?
feel better ?
yeah .
there must &apos;ve been a bad scallop in that paella last night .
you &apos;d think that half @-@ bottle of tequila you drank
would &apos;ve disinfected it .
oh , sorry to interrupt .
i &apos;m just , uh , moving some stuff over to susan &apos;s house .
you two shacking up now ?
actually , we &apos;re getting married .
you &apos;re kidding ! congratulations !
thanks .
you don &apos;t waste any time .
you know , i &apos;ve wasted a year .
i don &apos;t want to wake up one more day
without her lying next to me .
oh , god . here comes what &apos;s left of breakfast .
and , uh , you two better be careful .
all this wedding fever going around , you might catch it .
yeah , right .
what ?
i &apos;m sorry , i didn &apos;t realize the concept of our being married
was such a thigh @-@ slapper .
come on , edie .
it &apos;s way too soon for us to be talking marriage .
we only just started dating .
well , i know , but we could live together .
we &apos;re either at my house or your house every night anyway .
yeah , true , but ...
well , why not ? we &apos;re not kids anymore , carlos .
and i really care about you . don &apos;t you care about me ?
of course i do .
but ... i just took over mike &apos;s lease yesterday .
oh , please . old lady sims can find another tenant .
edie , i already signed the papers . i have a responsibility .
you know , that rent helps pay for her nursing home .
you understand , right ?
mrs. sims ?
edie ? edie britt ?
hi ! are you up for a visit ?
well , of course !
what a nice surprise . i haven &apos;t seen you for years .
oh , i know . and i feel awful about that .
i have always liked you so much .
you know ,
wisteria lane hasn &apos;t been the same since you left .
well , with my arthritis , i just couldn &apos;t live alone anymore .
but what i get from renting more than pays for this place .
oh , well , that &apos;s good .
although , with mike delfino getting married ,
your house is gonna be empty now .
actually , no .
a friend of mike &apos;s just signed a lease .
a very nice man . what was his name ?
it &apos;s here . carlos solis .
oh , dear .
what ?
what did mike tell you about carlos ?
oh , just that he &apos;s a nice , responsible man .
oh , well , he is when he &apos;s sober .
he has a drinking problem ?
well , actually , what i heard is ...
what am i doing ? i shouldn &apos;t be indulging in idle gossip .
edie , please !
smack . he does smack .
what ? good heavens .
well , he seemed such a nice man when i met him .
and he &apos;s got a good job .
i know . what is that term ?
&quot; functional junkie . &quot;
this is very upsetting . maybe i should re @-@ think this .
no ! i should learn to shut my big mouth .
here i am blathering on about drugs and prostitutes ...
prostitutes ? you never said anything about prostitutes .
and i &apos;m not going to .
frankly , i don &apos;t want to be on his bad side .
edie , i can &apos;t have someone like that in my house .
i have to tear up this lease .
oh , no , i can &apos;t let you do that .
not with your arthritis . here , you let me .
gabby !
oh , susan !
julie told me about ian . i am so sorry .
you must be devastated .
hey , gabby .
i see you &apos;ve picked up the pieces .
we got engaged last night . we &apos;re getting married !
oh , my god ! congratulations !
forget what julie told you about the wedding being off .
it &apos;s back on !
really ? same day ?
i promised people a wedding , they &apos;re getting one .
i &apos;m sorry , i can &apos;t make it . i have plans that day .
you can change your plans .
no , i really can &apos;t .
what could be more important to you than my wedding ?
uh , my wedding ?
what ?
oh , i see you got the invitation .
you &apos;re getting married on my wedding day ?
you cancelled . victor was kind of in a rush .
didn &apos;t think it looked good for the mayor to be shacking up .
every date we tried , someone had a conflict .
then your date opened up
and we knew all my friends were available ,
and well , you know , you too .
it &apos;s really no problem . we &apos;ll find another date .
gaby , did you think i &apos;d want to spend what would &apos;ve been
my wedding day watching someone else get married ?
i am so throwing that bouquet to you .
ok , if you think for one second ...
it &apos;s fine , really .
come on , susan , we &apos;ve got some calls to make .
oh , right . i have to cancel my wedding . again !
susan , hi .
is this a bad time ?
i &apos;m in the middle of something .
ok . well , i just wanted to say that
i &apos;m sorry for getting so snippy yesterday .
when i cancelled my wedding , you had every right to ...
susan ? susan ? is that my susan ?
bon soir
i am so sorry that i could not do your wedding flowers .
but the moment you canceled , your friend here she ...
how you say ? &quot; scoop me up . &quot;
you stole my florist ?
only because i admire your taste .
it &apos;s not theft , it &apos;s an homage .
i have left the bouquet and the centerpiece on the table .
if there are any changes , you let me know . avoir .
well , i gotta go .
i wanna see those flowers !
oh , my god ! that &apos;s my centerpiece !
now you suddenly have the trademark on peach tulips ?
in this town , in wedding season , yeah , i do !
you might as well have used my caterer and swing band !
yeah , listen , about that ...
oh , my god !
did you steal my whole wedding ?
it was short notice , ok ?
these people are booked months in advance .
the only people available were the ones you bailed on .
gabby , i spent months planning that wedding !
i see what you &apos;re getting at ,
and you know what , you are right .
you have been my de facto wedding planner
and you deserve to get paid .
all right . what &apos;s the going rate ? seven thousand ? eight ?
gabby ...
all right , ten . i &apos;m not gonna haggle .
i don &apos;t want to be paid . i want my wedding back .
well , you can &apos;t have it .
if you ask me , i am doing you a really big favor .
excuse me ?
you were rushing into this marriage thing way too fast .
why don &apos;t you give it some time
and see if you and mike work as a couple ?
i &apos;m rushing ? you met victor three months ago .
i &apos;ve known mike three years .
yeah , on and off ... mostly off !
what if you tie the knot in a month and realize that
you miss ian and mike misses the coma ?
i cannot believe that you just said that .
ok . you know what ?
i came over here to give you my response card ,
but here , this is my response !
you don &apos;t mean that .
that &apos;s just a big dramatic gesture .
oh , no , no , this is a big dramatic gesture !
my flowers !
no , they &apos;re my flowers !
enjoy your stolen wedding .
you can &apos;t do this ! i just signed a lease !
i &apos;m sorry .
the law says my mom has 72 hours to change her mind .
she &apos;s exercising that option .
hey , what &apos;s going on ?
i &apos;ve been evicted .
what ?
yeah . that was mrs. sims &apos; kid .
he &apos;s giving me 24 hours to move out of her house .
that is so weird .
it gets weirder .
he told me mrs. sims is praying for my spiritual recovery .
well , when old folks see the end coming .
they get all religious .
i guess .
so mind if i crash with you until i can find a new place ?
of course not .
thanks . i &apos;ll bring my stuff over in the morning .
why wait ? i &apos;ve got boxes in the garage .
i &apos;ll help you start packing now .
edie , did you have something to do with this ?
what ?
you have to admit , it is kind of a coincidence .
you ask me to move in , i say no , i get evicted ...
how dare you ! i offer to put a roof over your head ,
and you repay me with suspicions and insults ?
i don &apos;t even know that i want you in my house !
fine . i &apos;ll get a motel .
whoa , hold on ! let &apos;s not be hasty !
i knew it . you were behind this !
ok . if you want to fight , fine .
but let &apos;s talk about the real issue here .
why are you so reluctant to make a commitment to me ?
i told you , i don &apos;t want to talk about this .
well , you never do , but you owe me an explanation .
why don &apos;t you want to move in with me ?
because i &apos;m not in love with you .
edie , i &apos;m sorry . i really like you , i ...
no , i get it . it &apos;s just a little upsetting because ...
... i &apos;m late .
edie , you can &apos;t be pregnant . you &apos;re on the pill .
you know , i might &apos;ve forgotten to take it a couple of days .
i &apos;ve been nauseous for an entire week .
so i went and got a pregnancy test .
i figure i should find out if i &apos;m carrying your love child .
oh , wait , my mistake .
your &quot; like &quot; child .
so ? what does it say ?
it &apos;s gonna take a couple more minutes .
i just peed on that . for god &apos;s sake , put it on a coaster .
this is just dandy . i &apos;m 40 , single and knocked up .
but on the bright side , the dad &apos;s not into me .
edie , if you are pregnant ,
i &apos;m not gonna let you go through this alone .
so what ? you &apos;re gonna be my lamaze partner ?
no . i &apos;m saying i &apos;ll step up .
i &apos;ll be there to help you raise him .
you serious ?
i was there practically every day to help you with travers .
what makes you think that i &apos;d do any less if it were my child ?
well , thanks . that &apos;s nice to know .
you know ...
... your spare bedroom would make a great nursery .
yeah , i guess it would .
i mean it &apos;s right down the hall from the master .
so we &apos;d be able to hear him when he was crying .
we ? you &apos;d move in ?
i told you that i would be here for you .
we could even decorate his room in ,
like a whole pirate theme .
i always wanted to do that if i had a son .
you know what would be really cool ?
decorate his bed like ...
like a ship with a sail and a mast ...
carlos , it &apos;s negative .
well , that &apos;s a relief , huh ?
yeah . we really dodged a bullet .
so ... let &apos;s celebrate , have a drink .
oh , and by the way , you &apos;re still welcome to stay ,
until you find a place .
that &apos;s nice of you . thanks .
i cannot thank you enough for doing this .
thanks for taking the time out of your day .
hey , tom , i &apos;m not sure this is the best approach .
i &apos;ve never done a session before
where half of the couple didn &apos;t know
i was a marriage counselor .
we &apos;ll tell her . eventually .
i just don &apos;t want to scare her off .
hey , lynette ...
yeah ?
look , who walked in off the streets !
scott mckinney . remember ?
we pledged alpha tau together . i told you about him .
you won the beer pong championship .
you told her about that ?
yeah . then you threw up in the trophy .
that is far from his only accomplishment . he &apos;s got a ph.d.
well , i &apos;d love to chat , but i have cheese to grate .
wait ... honey , no , wait , please ...
i will do that later . i want you guys to know each other .
i mean , this guy , this is my boy .
so scott got married the same year that we did .
how &apos;s your wife liking fairview ?
well , her whole family &apos;s back east .
so she kind of resisted the move .
really ? so that was a source of conflict ?
yes , well , all couples have their conflicts .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ve had your share .
oh , sure , now and then .
emphasis on &quot; now . &quot;
tom ...
scott shared with us .
we &apos;re going through kind of a rough patch .
i see , well , i &apos;m sure it &apos;s something you &apos;ll get through .
the trick is to keep lines of communication open .
boy , easier said than done .
so this rough patch .
what would you say is the underlying issue there ?
well , scott , i &apos;m not sure i would say .
particularly not to someone i just met .
well , he &apos;s just trying to help .
if you ask me , i &apos;d say it started when our manager rick quit .
ok , and how did that make you feel , lynette ?
i am not answering that ! this is not a therapy session !
but if it were , what would you say ?
oh , dear god , you didn &apos;t .
what ... didn &apos;t what ?
ok , ok . give it up , tom .
yes , yes , lynette , i am a couples counselor .
really ? and what do you call this , &quot; ambush therapy &quot; ?
it was my idea .
i &apos;m just trying to get you to talk about what &apos;s going on .
and don &apos;t tell me that nothing &apos;s going on !
good , good . all our cards are on the table .
cram it ! ok , yeah , tom , i &apos;ve been unhappy lately .
i am working through some issues .
that is something i need to do on my own .
talking about it doesn &apos;t help .
not to you , and certainly not to dr. beer pong !
well , i &apos;m billing you for a whole hour .
so is there anything else on your mind ?
i &apos;m sorry , but this time gabby has crossed a line ,
and i will not make myself sit through her wedding .
julie thinks i &apos;m overreacting .
you don &apos;t think i &apos;m overreacting , do you ?
yeah , a little .
absolutely not .
what ? she asked .
look , even if gabby &apos;s in the wrong here ...
and she is . hugely , hideously wrong .
do you really want to boycott her wedding ?
she said that i &apos;d make mike wish he was back in a coma !
i think her point , and again , i wish she &apos;d expressed herself
a little more tactfully , was that marriage is unpredictable .
we can &apos;t know what it &apos;ll be until we &apos;re in it .
don &apos;t defend that self @-@ centered brat .
she steals susan &apos;s wedding .
and then expects to stay friends .
she divorces carlos .
and doesn &apos;t want anyone else to date him .
i &apos;ve never known anyone as dishonest and manipulative .
speaking of carlos , i hear he got evicted .
yeah , that was a real shocker .
anyway , you stick to your guns .
don &apos;t you dare go to that wedding .
it could ruin your friendship .
are you willing to take that chance ?
no , i guess not .
wuss .
well , at least get her a thoughtless , crappy gift .
like a blender .
i got you a blender for christmas .
and i use it every day . gotta go .
honey , i am so sorry ! i hope you don &apos;t hate me !
i don &apos;t ! i was just on my way to apologize to you .
you know , i changed all my flowers .
you don &apos;t have to .
the hell i don &apos;t . those peach tulips belong to you .
and so do these .
thank you . i was just bringing you this .
well , we got chocolate and wine ...
your place or mine ?
i am so glad we &apos;re doing this . i hate it when we fight .
me too .
and i &apos;m so sorry about that comment i made about mike .
it was way out of line .
you guys are gonna be insanely happy .
i think so , too .
but , you know , then i remember .
that &apos;s what i thought about me and karl .
please . mike is not karl .
well , you know , when i married him , karl wasn &apos;t karl .
and i think that &apos;s why i got so mad at you .
because 99 percent of me is sure ,
that we &apos;re gonna be totally happy ,
but then what you said ,
it just stirred up that pesky one percent .
honey , please . if anyone should be nervous it &apos;s me .
i met victor three months ago . i mean , i &apos;m crazy about him .
it &apos;s just the thought of saying those vows again ,
it &apos;s scary .
lynette is right .
you know , marriage is like ... it &apos;s like these bonbons .
you never know what you &apos;re getting
until you &apos;re in the middle of it .
it &apos;s one of those hard , jelly ones .
do you think that &apos;s an omen ?
honey , you &apos;re gonna be ok .
all right ? we &apos;re gonna help each other through this .
right . yeah .
getting married is scary .
but at least we &apos;ll be doing it together .
oh , my god ! we should totally do that .
what ?
get married ! together !
you and me ?
well , i ... i &apos;m beyond flattered ,
i find you to be an incredibly attractive woman . i just ...
oh , no , stupid ! i mean a double wedding !
oh . oh ! oh , i would love that !
i know ! then you wouldn &apos;t be mad for the day .
i wouldn &apos;t feel guilty !
we could be brides together !
yes ! let &apos;s celebrate ! more chocolate !
just so you know , if i was a lesbian , i &apos;d totally do you .
that &apos;s good to know .
it &apos;s a fact of life that brides to be , &lt; / i &gt;
who agree to double weddings late at night , &lt; / i &gt;
often feel differently , come the dawn . &lt; / i &gt;
this change of heart was certainly true &lt; / i &gt;
in the case of susan mayer . &lt; / i &gt;
and even more so ... &lt; / i &gt;
... for gabrielle solis . &lt; / i &gt;
morning .
hi , honey .
i hope i didn &apos;t wake you last night .
i was at susan &apos;s till midnight .
is something wrong ?
no . not exactly .
just a small change of plans about the wedding .
what kind of change ?
see , susan was really upset ...
i mean , i &apos;ve never seen gabby so torn up with guilt ...
practically in tears over this whole wedding date thing ...
and she kept saying , &quot; please , let me make it up to you ... &quot;
so , after an hour of this , i suddenly heard myself say ...
&quot; hey , how about a double wedding ? &quot;
wanted to bite my tongue the minute it came out .
she &apos;s so excited , so needy ...
jumping up and down and hugging me ...
i mean , what could i say ?
so we &apos;re kind of stuck .
so , what do you think ?
i think anything that makes you happy is fine by me .
will this make you happy ?
no ! i &apos;m screwed !
i cannot get out of this without hurting her feelings .
maybe this will help . i forbid it .
you do ?
sure .
tell her that your groom &apos;s an old @-@ fashioned guy
and he doesn &apos;t want to see anybody
on that altar but his bride .
if she gets mad , have her take it up with me .
so this is what marriage is about .
having someone to hide behind .
so , what do you think ?
you &apos;re gonna have to undo this .
how ? i know i shouldn &apos;t have offered , but i did .
i can &apos;t just take it back .
well , you &apos;re gonna have to .
you have any idea what this day means to me ?
i do . and i know you &apos;ve worked really hard
to make our wedding perfect .
exactly . do you think i want to share it with your friend
and her ex @-@ convict fianc ?
that &apos;s your problem ?
gaby , i &apos;m the mayor of this town .
how &apos;s it gonna look ? there &apos;ll be press there .
press ? at our wedding ?
well , we &apos;re public figures .
so all of this planning , and attention to detail ,
that &apos;s all been about your image ?
of course not !
gaby , this is gonna be the proudest day of my life .
i &apos;m not sharing the spotlight with anyone .
how about the bride ?
oh , please , every eye in that place is gonna be on you .
every woman will wish they were you ,
every guy &apos;ll wish they had you .
it &apos;s gonna be great .
tell your friends you &apos;re sorry .
tell them i &apos;ll even pay for their wedding .
but they &apos;re not sharing mine .
here &apos;s a one @-@ bedroom at the oaks
with a view of the golf course .
that &apos;s gonna go fast .
i &apos;m gonna call on this first thing in the morning .
or , i know this is the last thing you &apos;d expect to hear from me ,
but what if you stayed here with me
and we tried to have a baby ?
are you serious ?
i saw the look on your face
when that test came back negative .
admit it , you were disappointed .
yeah , maybe a little .
well , so was i.
you were ?
yeah , i was .
you know , having travers here made me realize that
i like being a mom .
and you were so great with him . well , think ...
we could have that all the time .
edie , nobody wants a kid more than me .
it &apos;s just ...
yeah , yeah , we &apos;re not head over heels in love .
we like each other , right ?

carlos , look around .
everyone &apos;s taking big steps .
gabby and victor , susan and mike .
this could be our step .
we both need to love someone .
no one said it had to be each other .
just think about it .
邀请您5月9日 周六下午3点 参加婚礼
let &apos;s do it .
you really want to ?
yeah .
i &apos;m tired of waiting for my life to start .
oh , carlos .
imagine , with your genes and mine ,
that child is gonna be a knockout .
i &apos;m gonna brush my teeth ,
i &apos;m gonna flush those birth control pills ,
and we &apos;re gonna get crackin &apos; !
how &apos;re you doing ?
good .
listen , we need to talk .
i spoke to mike
and he &apos;s just not really into the whole double wedding thing .
mike said no ?
yeah , he sort of wants the day just to be about us .
so we &apos;re gonna wait until the fall . i am so sorry .
no , no , it &apos;s ok . victor was kind of on the fence about it too .
oh , good !
i mean , not that they said no , i really wanted to do it .
me too . i think it would have been so much fun .
yeah .
well , i gotta go .
i gotta meet francois .
see ya .
oh , by the way ...
that one @-@ percent sliver of a doubt thing i told you about ?
totally gone .
any question i had about mike &apos;s been answered .
that must feel really great .
yeah .
i feel really good about this .
i do , too .
our friends are probably gonna make fun of us .
yeah , i &apos;m sure .
but who cares . it &apos;s gonna be great .
i &apos;m so happy we &apos;re gonna be living together .
we &apos;re going to have so much fun .
i &apos;ll be right out .
ok ... let &apos;s make a baby .
i talked to my back doctor today .
what did he have to say ?
he said , assuming i exercise reasonable caution .
i can have sex again .
and what would that have to do with me ?
well , you don &apos;t seem to want to talk to me these days ,
so i figured it &apos;s the one thing
that we can do together without speaking .
remember when i was giving birth to the twins
and screaming in agony
because porter was dragging my uterus out with him ?
well , i was more in the mood for sex then than i am now .
lynette ...
i &apos;m your husband .
i have to find a way to connect to you somehow .
so we can have sex or we can talk .
your call .
fine . let &apos;s have sex .
what ?
yeah , let &apos;s get this off .
you &apos;d rather have sex with me than talk to me ?
yep .
hey ... ow ! that hurts !
i said i &apos;d have sex , i didn &apos;t say i &apos;d make love .
you want to play rough ? because i can play rough !
cut it out !
sorry , i &apos;ll try to be gentler as i move down south .
ok , fine . you are mad at me !
but name one thing that i have done to deserve it !
you had lunch with rick .
you &apos;re damn right i did !
i saw the security tape . what was i supposed to do ?
pretend that nothing was going on ?
nothing was going on ! he never touched me !
and i wasn &apos;t gonna sit around and wait until it did .
i am glad that i made him quit .
you didn &apos;t make him quit . i fired him !
you what ?
the idiot told me he had feelings for me ,
which he never &apos;d have done if you hadn &apos;t pushed him !
and now he &apos;s gone . it &apos;s all your fault !
ow ! my back !
lynette ?
honey ?
it &apos;ll just be a few more minutes , mrs. scavo .
the doctor &apos;s looking at your cat scan .
thank you .
this whole thing is ridiculous . i bumped my head .
lynette , you were dizzy and throwing up .
can &apos;t be too careful .
well , i feel just fine now .
when rick said he had feelings for you ...
... what did you say ?
i said that it was totally inappropriate , and then i fired him .
do you have feelings for him , lynette ?
do you have feelings for rick ?
i would never cheat on you . you know that .
that &apos;s not what i asked .
did you fall for him ?
oh , god .
nothing happened . he &apos;s gone . it &apos;s over .
don &apos;t tell me it &apos;s over .
we &apos;ve been fighting for this all week .
you miss him , don &apos;t you ?
don &apos;t do this .
damn .
not now . i can &apos;t .
mrs. scavo ?
that &apos;s me .
i &apos;ll be back .
actually , i &apos;d rather have you both come in for this .
is it a concussion ?
no , it &apos;s just a bruise .
oh , good .
but i noticed something in your cat scan that concerns me .
you have a few swollen lymph nodes in your neck .
i want to send you in for a biopsy .
a biopsy ? why ?
have you noticed any change in your appetite lately ?
any fatigue , fevers ?
stop , just stop . what is it you think i have ?
i don &apos;t want you to panic . this can be any number of things .
is one of them cancer ?
it could be lymphoma .
we &apos;re hoping the biopsy will rule that out .
if you look at the cat scan ,
you can see this white area here stands out .
these are called submandibular lymph nodes .
lymphoma can vary according to the type of cell
that multiplies , and how the cancer presents itself .
there are two types ,
hodgkin &apos;s and non @-@ hodgkin &apos;s lymphoma .
from the moment we wake up in the morning , &lt; / i &gt;
till our head hits the pillow at night , &lt; / i &gt;
our lives are filled with questions . &lt; / i &gt;
is it morning yet ?
most are easily answered and soon forgotten . &lt; / i &gt;
not yet , sweetheart . you go back to sleep now .
but some questions are much harder to ask , &lt; / i &gt;
because we &apos;re so afraid of the answer . &lt; / i &gt;
will i be around to watch my children grow up ? &lt; / i &gt;
am i making a mistake by marrying this man ? &lt; / i &gt;
could he ever truly love me ? &lt; / i &gt;
and what happens when we ask ourself the hard question , &lt; / i &gt;
and get the answer we &apos;d been hoping for ? &lt; / i &gt;
well , that &apos;s when happiness begins . &lt; / i &gt;
