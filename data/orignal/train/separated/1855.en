One of the hardest lessons as a doctor
is learning to prioritize.
Truck.
Cabin.
Spoon.
Truck.
Cabin.
Spoon.
Very good.
We're trained to do all we can to save life and limb.
But if cutting off a limb means saving a life,
we learn to do it without hesitation.
Several months ago, I asked you to remember three words.
Can you tell me what they were?
Truck.
Cabin.
Spoon.
The three words I asked you to remember,
what were they?
It's not an easy lesson to learn,
and it always comes down to one question...
What are the stakes?
Truck.
Cabin?
And the third word?
What do we stand to gain or lose?
At the end of the day, we're just gamblers
trying not to bet the farm.
Spoon.
Spoon.
Spoon.
Excellent.
Chief.
You paged?
How's it going?
Well, the word "Spoon"
has ceased to have any meaning for me,
But I'm through the first test set.
I have a few more consults today, but what's up?
Meredith...
I would like to initiate a clinical trial.
One that would be the next major advancement
in the fight to cure Type I diabetes.
And I'd like you to participate.
But I am on Derek's Alzheimer's trial,
so I don't think I I can do both.
Just listen.
The basis of this trial was something that I found in here.
In my mother's journals?
Yes.
She was working on islet cell transplantation
when she became ill,
trying to eliminate the need for anti-rejection meds altogether.
W-with her notes, drugs, and new technology,
there's no way we can't take this the rest of the way down the field.
We?
Well, it's your mother's work.
I wouldn't feel right moving forward
if you weren't a part of it.
You should look at them both.
Just think about it. It's your decision.
It's your birthright, Meredith.
It's your mother's legacy to you.
What is it?
It's a kale and apple juice smoothie.
It's time to think less about your cravings
and more about filling that baby with nutrients,
which that has.
It also has chunks. I don't drink chunks.
I want my coffee. Mark, tell the woman
I'm allowed to drink one cup of regular coffee.
Sure you are.
Oh, w-wait, Mark.
Are you aware that there are studies that link caffeine
with preterm labor, low birth weight, other birth defects?
That goo looks great.
I say you stick with the goo.
Okay, you two can't just dictate
what I'm allowed to eat and drink.
Nobody's dictating anything.
But you're pregnant now, so things have to be different.
You're gonna have to eat better and take it easier at work.
And well, if it helps, we'll give up caffeine, too.
That helps no one.
Well, how about we put it to a vote?
All in favor of Callie drinking coffee, raise your hand.
All in favor of the goo.
Goo it is.
It's horrible.
It's the opposite of horrible.
Alzheimer's or diabetes?
If you continue to whine about how you can't decide
which groundbreaking medical advancement to put your name on,
I'll punch you in the ear.
well, my name's already on one of them,
according to the chief. I mean,
diabetes...
...affects 240 million people worldwide.
And Alzheimer's...
...is the seventh leading cause of death.
It's "Sophie's choice."
It's "Sophie's choice."
I've never seen that movie.
Oh, you should. It's really funny.
Greys, okay. How long has
your father been having abdominal pain?
Abdominal pain?
It sounds like abdominal pain.
Thatcher Grey is not an easy man to get information from.
Our-- our father's here in the hospital?
Yeah, I admitted him an hour ago.
You didn't know he was coming?
Well, what--what--what's wrong?
Could it be related to the liver transplant?
Of course. He's rejecting it because it's my liver.
Okay, look, just do me a favor, go take a blood sample,
and try to get some more information out of him.
I-I need someone who speaks Grey.
Hey, stranger.
Meredith has two groundbreaking clinical trials,
and I don't have any.
Okay, but you have a husband that loves you.
Yeah, so does she.
Then... then I guess you're screwed.
I thought I knew all the nurses on this floor.
How did I miss you?
I guess I'm just lucky that way.
I'm Alex Karev.
Neat.
And you are?
Not telling you my name.
Any reason why not?
Because, uh, I don't want to.
Okay.
Then how about you pass me one of those charts?
I hear there's a turnip in the cabbage patch.
A turnip?
Gorked. Brain-dead.
Dr. Robbins and I have a baby
with a hypoplastic left heart.
The transplant coordinator--
suggested the, uh, turnip as a potential donor.
Yeah.
Well, now you do get to know my name.
I'm Dr. Lucy Fields.
I delivered that gorked baby.
So, uh, thanks for the heads-up.
I'll talk to the transplant coordinator.
But now you need to leave.
Come on. There's no reason to overreact.
Really?
Well, now you're barred from the NICU.
How's that for overreacting?
You can't do that.
Want to find out?
Oh, what do we have here?
You really don't want to know.
Let me get that for you, Dr. Torres.
Okay, Randy Shouse, 23.
Multiple injuries after slamming into a brick wall.
H-how did you --
Idiot and his idiot buddies built a human slingshot.
I wasn't supposed to hit the wall.
I was supposed to fly over the house
and la-land in the pool.
But why would you do that?
So they could film it, put it on the internet,
and show the world just how stupid they actually are.
Dude.
Did you get that?
Yeah, buddy. Yeah.
But why?
Because it's hilarious, that's why.
Okay, Randy, that must have been some kind of awesome slingshot,
because it looks like you've dislocated both hips.
Now I'm gonna need to get some X-rays.
I'm on it!
Wow. She's perky.
Mm-hmm. Better than stupid with a death wish.
You're sick enough
that you need to come into the hospital,
and you don't even call me?
The pain comes and goes. I didn't want to worry --
So you thought that you would just sneak in
and just quietly reject Meredith's liver,
not even make a fuss?
Just c-calm down, please.
Oh, no. I am calm. I am so calm.
I'm like the calmest one.
Okay, good.
Because there's something else
that I should have told you.
I go to a AA couple times a week.
Yes, that I know.
No, I know you know, but sometimes,
you have to get up in front of the group
and you say your piece, and then people sometimes
come up to you afterwards and say
that they like what you said,
and then maybe you go to
coffee with them afterward.
Yeah, like a sponsor?
No, not a sponsor. Oh, how do I --
Oh, there you are. Sorry. I got turned around,
and then I ended up back in the lobby.
N-no, no.
Mm. No, no, no, no. Oh.
Oh, God. What?
I'm sorry. Are-- are you in pain?
Not a sponsor.
I am so sorry.
This was not the way that I wanted to meet you.
Well, I didn't even know there was a you to meet.
I know. I-I'm sorry. I -- - Okay, Mr. Grey -- oh, hello.
Dr. Bailey, this is...Danielle.
Dani. Hi.
Yes, Dani.
That's my father's girlfriend,
whom I've just met just now.
Oh, I see.
Um, nice to meet you, Dani. I just have a few questions,
and then I will let you get back to all of this.
Do you really think I could be rejecting this liver?
Because Dani has been amazing
helping me take care of myself.
And I'm constantly taking pills.
His anti-rejection meds. Not, like, speed or anything.
'Cause that would be inappropriate.
Um, when did the pain start?
12 days ago.
Sh-she's good with details.
Any fevers or changes in your urine or stool?
No fevers.
But there was a...pain incident,
uh, last week, Thursday.
A-actually, you might not want to hear this part.
I'm a doctor.
All right.
Well, we were being intimate...
Oh, no. - And I was on top --
Oh, oh, okay.
Go on.
Dr. Avery.
It's about time I had you on my service.
Thank you, Dr. Sloan.
I gotta say,
I really think I have the hands for plastics.
Oh, forget about your hands.
Look at those cheekbones.
Sir?
You're genetically blessed.
Don't think I haven't noticed.
And speaking from personal experience, I can say that
that will only help you in plastics.
That face? Better than a hundred billboards, my man.
All right, Dr. Sloan, I really don't feel comfortable
being judged or praised based on my looks.
Oh, poor Mr. Green eyes.
Let's not pretend being beautiful's a burden.
Now come on. Mrs. Johnson's nose isn't gonna fix itself.
How about a little sparkle?
There it is.
Hip dislocation, fractures of his femur,
radius, ribs, and metacarpals.
Should we just, uh, go ahead and reduce those hips?
Kepner, I need you to speak differently.
I'm sorry? - It's your voice. It's a little --
Just speak differently.
Like with an accent or -- - Never mind.
You know, how about
you get me a muffin from the cafeteria?
Get me the sugariest kind you can find, and some coffee.
Wait. No.
Damn it. No coffee.
Okay.
No. You know what? Yes.
Coffee. Please.
Great.
Crap! No. N-n-no coffee.
You sure?
No, no coffee. Just...just -- just go.
Okay.
Uh, did you still want the muffin?
Yes.
Okay, yes, I know that I'm not Dr. Bailey,
but he's my father,
and I really need his lab results.
Sorry, I can't do it.
Okay, well, then maybe I'll just
let your supervisor know that
I've been highly unsatisfied with your service today.
This isn't the mall. We don't have comment cards.
Well, maybe you should.
Hey. You okay? You need me to talk to him?
Mark, no.
My day has been too messed up to have you in it, too.
Son of a bitch.
We know without a doubt
that this heart is a viable option.
How? How do we know that this is a good match?
Well, babies under a a year haven't developed
an immune system that will reject the new organ.
It makes matching a lot easier.
But we're still four weeks away from the due date.
Our OB isn't even in town right now.
I'm covering for Dr. Napolitano.
I've got her blessing
to go ahead and do the c-section today.
Today? T -- that's really --
Colin, time's an issue here.
We need to inform the transplant board
as soon as possible if you want this heart.
Otherwise, it's gonna go to another family.
Whoa. Okay. You know what?
There are a lot of doctors in the room right now.
So why don't we give the Cookes some space?
You can have one of the nurses page us
when you've made a decision.
What's going on? Why didn't you page me?
Turnip, Karev?
You tattled on me?
You're so off this case.
Seriously? I have said way worse stuff than that.
Yeah, not helping.
Are you kidding me?!
Avery, you want to give the osteotomies a shot?
Yes, sir.
Mallet, please.
You live with Lexie Grey now, right?
How's she doing these days?
Okay, I guess.
Okay? She hasn't seemed upset?
She kind of cries sometimes, but she seems okay.
Now are you gonna strip the, uh, lateral cartilage here?
Crying seems fine?
She's a girl. Girls cry.
But you don't know what she's been upset about?
Not really any of my business.
What's next?
Next, I finish up here
while you go find out what's up with Lexie.
Sorry?
She's upset. You're gonna find out why.
You want to be on my service, then serve.
Use that Avery sparkle.
Dr. Sloan--
I'm gonna do a couple more rhinoplasties this afternoon.
You do me this solid, and I just might be persuaded
to let you take the lead on one.
OK.
Oh. What are you doing?
Uh... I looked it up,
and those, uh, caffeine studies showed
birth defects in rats,
and I'm not a rat, so...
tell her I'm not a rat.
Well, let her have--
Hey, we took a vote.
Yeah, well, I have to fix multiple fractures, Arizona.
That's major surgery. Okay? So that totally changes
the situation, completely.
And Mark's not here, so it's your vote against mine.
I need caffeine.
Okay, you want caffeine that badly, Calliope, fine.
You're a grown-up. You can make your own decisions.
That's right. So...
Damn it.
Damn it!
That is s not fair. You're not fair. Ugh.
For someone who has a history of ambivalence towards motherhood,
you got the whole guilt thing down cold.
I am entitled to an opinion.
I mean, I've been left out of too much
of the conversation already, and I sure as hell
did not choose Mark Sloan to be the father.
So if I'm gonna do this, then you know what?
I'm gonna have a voice.
Oh, God. That's good.
Holy crap. Your mom was smart.
Truck.
Cabin. Spoon.
3-for-3.
Crap. This is so good.
Is it better than this?
'Cause seriously, Mere, you'd have to
have died of Alzheimer's to fail this.
I don't even know if I'm doing it yet.
You have to. Mother-daughter surgeons cure leading killer?
I mean, I'm still jealous, and I'm doing a heart transplant
on a baby that hasn't even been born yet.
Will you shut up about that?
You're the one who needs to keep his mouth shut, cabbage patch.
Screw this. I've been on this case for a month.
I'm not just gonna sit here.
Meredith, you have to come see Dad.
Oh, does he want more organs?
He wouldn't say.
He was too busy loving up on a tattooed 20 year old.
Is that upsetting you?
You wanna talk about it?
No.
No worries.
I have a surgery to get to.
Meredith.
I can't deal with my dad.
I'm too busy with my mom.
Mere, let's go. I want to see
your dad making out with his tatted-up fiance.
They're not engaged.
Are you sure?
Meredith, please.
Fine.
You're doing great, Sarah.
I didn't hear her cry.
Her lungs were junky. We had to intubate.
She deteriorated fast.
I'll call for an x-ray and an ultrasound.
Already ordered it.
Well, what's her PH? You'll need an A.B.G.--
Karev, we got it.
Yeah, Dr. Robbins, she's my patient.
Not anymore.
You got something for me, Avery?
I do, actually. Uh, her dad's here.
He might be rejecting his liver,
and he brought his 20-year-old girlfriend.
Yeah, that'll do it.
Lexie's probably going crazy.
Meredith's no help when it comes to their father.
I'm not gonna be lead surgeon on a rhinoplasty, am I?
She just needs someone to talk to.
We are not closed. That is not something we do.
Peanut butter cups.
What?
She's a stress eater.
You get her eating, you get her talking.
She loves peanut butter cups.
That's's ridiculous.
Tomorrow, I'm doing a series of cleft palate surgeries
for the Nightingales Foundation pro bono.
That sort of thing might look fantastic
on the resume of someone who's
in the running for chief resident.
Might?
Get some results,
we'll talk.
Ugh. Get in there.
And do what?
Well, make it stop.
There's no way she's 20. She's gotta be like 26, 27.
I'm 27.
Gross.
Uh, tiny baby heart time.
Careful when you go in there, Mer.
You tangle with one hell's angel,
you tangle with the whole gang.
You coming?
I'm not going in there again.
Seriously, Lexie?
I can't.
Well, then I'm going back to work.
Meredith--
All right. Hey, uh, move, please.
I'm gonna page Bailey.
This is what happened last time.
All right, Dad, is it the same pain?
Where--where does it hurt?
I'm telling you,
I have seen this before.
Okay, well, I'm sorry.
Will you please let him talk?
He can't talk.
No, it's here. Ow!
All right, all right. Just back up, please.
Baby, it's gonna be okay. Okay? I'm right here.
Back up.
I need to do something.
Please just tell me what I can do.
Okay, back the hell up right now!
All right. All right, Dad.
The blood tests indicate that your liver is fine.
Is there anything at all that you've left out?
It's when he pees.
Uh, just now and then last Thursday,
we had Mexican food, and he drank all this water
because it was spicy,
and he went to the bathroom as soon as we got home.
I was freaked out when he screamed later during the sex,
I didn't even connect it.
Uh, all right, all right. Good. That helps.
So what--what do you think it could be?
Well that--it could be kidney stones or your prostate.
Prostate? Are you saying he could have cancer? He--
he can't have cancer.
That's what happens when your boyfriend's an old man.
Old men get cancer.
Lexie, come on.
No, but see, if you were a doctor like we are,
you'd realize that when we use the word "prostate,"
it doesn't necessarily mean cancer.
Dr. Grey--
No, see, freaking out and jumping to conclusions like a little child
isn't gonna do him any good.
I am scared, okay?
I am terrified over here, and I've got questions.
You're terrified? We're his family.
I am his family, too!
No, you're not his family! You're his midlife crisis!
Lexie, Lexie. That's enough. You're out of line.
No, y--fine.
Lexie.
Le--
Uh, cancer is--is one of a hundred things it could be.
Dr. Bailey will run some more test just to rule it out.
It's far more likely there's another explanation for this.
Are you the daughter that gave him the liver?
I am.
Thank you.
Say it again for the camera.
No. No, I don't think I will.
Kepner, talk to the camera
so we can get to the O.R.
In my normal voice?
Or y--
Randy has multiple fractures.
The most pressing problems are his hip dislocations.
So we are going to reduce them as soon as possible
before they loose blood flow.
Reduce?
Uh, pop 'em back into place.
Oh, man.
Hold on. Let me, uh, let me get up on this chair
for the wide angle.
We're not gonna-- we're not gonna do it here.
He has to be sedated, and we have to fix his femur,
so we're just gonna do everything in the O.R.
Wait. What if we did the hips here,
you know, while I'm awake?
And then I can give the thumbs-up to the camera.
Uh, you're really not grasping how much this will hurt.
Well, it's for the art, Dr. Torres.
You know what?
That is a great idea.
Dr. Hunt, I think that it's--
Dr. Torres, it is for the art.
Okay.
Marcus, hop on that chair. Kepner support him.
Okay. You guys ready?
Aah! Please stop! Stop!
Stop! Turn the camera off! Stop! Oh!
Turn the camera off! Marcus, turn the camera off!
That totally cheered me up.
Well, art has that effect.
Listen...
I'm sorry about the turnip thing.
I shouldn't have said it.
Doctor to doctor, you overreacted.
That's my patient. I deserve to be in there.
You deserve it, huh?
You know, I have a patient, too.
You want to know what happened to my patient?
Look, I'm sure it's tough--
She had a 40-hour labor,
and then the baby was stuck on an angle, wouldn't drop.
So my patient just had to push...
and push and push.
And you want to know what you say to a woman
who's in that kind of pain?
You say, "One more, Jackie.
One more, and you're gonna see that baby.
One more, and you're gonna have a beautifuful baby boy.
I know it hurts. I know it does.
But give me one more, Jackie,
and you get a baby."
That's how you get a woman to tear her own body apart.
You promise her a baby.
You make a promise,
and she hurts herself because she trusts you.
And then...
when the baby comes out and he's not, uh...
he's not...
You're the one that's gotta tell her
that you were... mistaken.
Makes me kind of lose interest
in what you deserve...
Mr. Where's the Cabbage Patch.
Oh, hey, Dad's got a kidney stone.
Dr. Bailey's taking him up to the O.R. now.
Oh, she didn't just give him a strainer? It's gotta be huge.
Yeah, well, he deserves it.
You know, I never really got it before,
but this is how he operates.
He starts a new family, stops talking the old ones.
So he'll go off marrying Dani the tatto girl,
have six little midlife crisis babies,
and I'll never hear from him again.
It's exactly what he did to you.
It is not exactly what he did to me.
Of course it is.
Lexie, my mother had an affair,
and then took his kid across the country.
Your mother died, and he was miserable,
and he started drinking, and he destroyed his liver.
This isn't about you. He found someone who makes him happy.
Just give them your blessing. Let him be happy.
What are you talking about? Don't defend him.
You hate him. Hate him with me.
Lexie, I love you, but you have to grow up.
Got a strong heartbeat.
I think she likes her new heart.
Of course she does. It's delightful.
All right. Let's take off the clamp, Dr. Yang.
Why is her blood pressure so low?
There's a very low arterial pressure wave.
All right, let's, uh, let's check it.
Maybe there's a kink in the arterial line somewhere.
Damn it. Turn up the flow.
That aorta needs a long diagonal anastomosis.
Well, that'll take at least 45 minutes.
Well, we don't have that.
We've gotta do it in 30,
otherwise we're gonna lose her. Scalpel. Clamp it.
Start the clock.
Son of a bitch.
I hate this. I hate this.
Come on. Come on.
What time do you have, Yang?
27 minutes.
Okay. I'm ready.
Clamp off.
We got this.
Robbins, Altman, they got this.
Yeah? Then why do you look sick?
Pressure wave's coming back.
Oh. Systolic's 57.
60.
64.
82.
Oh, that's it. Yes.
Yes!
Yes!
Chief, I'm, uh, I'm with a patient.
Did you get a chance to look over the materials?
I did. It's amazing.
Well, the next step is getting the funding in place,
and I can make two phone calls and have that by midweek.
Uh, s-so you're waiting for...
Uh, you.
You have to sign on as co-investigator
so we can start moving forward.
Chief, it's an amazing offer.
It's not an offer, Meredith.
I can't offer something that doesn't belong to me.
It was your mother's work,
and it's only right that you continue it.
I, um... So you think that I owe it to her?
Honestly?
I think she owes it to you.
She didn't give you a lot of love,
but she gave you her talent and her name...
and this.
This gift could change the course of your career.
I... have to get back inside.
Meredith...
it might change the way you think about her.
It could be the greatest thing the both of you ever did.
How did it get to this?
How did four seconds of internet fame
become worth breaking yourself into a million pieces?
He did it because he thinks it's funny.
That's bull. You don't just put yourself at that kind of risk.
Well, it's his decision.
His decision?
Idiots like this shouldn't be allowed to make any--
It is his body, okay? And you dot get to say
what he can and can't do with it.
He is a person.
He getto make his own damn choices.
I am going through the worst caffeine withdrawal of my life
because someone thinks that being pregnant
means I'm no longer of sound freakin' mind!
You're pregnant?
Shut up! I'm not endangering my baby.
I just-I just want one damn cup of coffee!
Okay. Kepner, go get Dr. Torres a cup of coffee. Okay?
Run.
Thank you.
Mm-hmm. Congratulations.
Oh, whatever.
Just come around here and help me with his hip.
All right. One...
Two, three.
She doesn't seem so bad.
Candy?
Screw you and your candy.
She's terrible.
All right.
Ever notice how my sister's a jerk?
I, um--
Yeah, "Give them your blessing." What a bunch of crap.
You know, "Let him be happy"? What about me, you know?
Everybody's making these huge life decisions,
and they're not even considering how it will affect me.
How I'll feel, you know?
I'm supposed to be such a big part of their lives,
and yet they're leaving me out of the conversation completely.
You know, starting up new families
and springing it on me when it's already a done deal.
You know, "Hey, lexie. Guess what.
I found a tatted-up skank to be your new mommy."
"Hey, Lexie. I'm gonna have a baby.
You're just gonna have to be okay with that."
Wait a second. Your dad's having a baby?
No, not my dad.
Mark.
Mark is having a baby.
And he didn't even ask my opinion.
He just clobbered me with it again.
And he's leaving me behind...
Again.
So we're done, you know?
We have to be.
But I miss him.
Crap.
My dad's tatted-up skank isn't the bitch.
I am.
Probably a good start
would be to stop calling her a tatted-up skank.
Right.
Thanks...
for listening.
Anytime.
I banned him from the NICU this morning.
I kinda want to go in there and kick him out.
Yeah, punishing Karev is one of my favorite pastimes, too.
He's harsh sometimes, but he's also the guy
that gets thrown off a case and then sits in the gallery
and watches an entire surgery just to make sure
his patient's okay.
I'll teach him to be less of an ass.
But I don't have to teach him what to care.
Do you even have the authority to ban someone from NICU?
I don't know.
Just in time, Avery. Scrub in and take the lead.
That's okay.
I just came by to tell you that you were wrong.
Those, uh, peanut butter cups got me nowhere.
You're kidding.
Guess you overestimated that Avery sparkle, huh?
Where you goin'? Scrub in.
Really?
I-I-I assumed, no results, no surgery.
I'm not a total bastard.
You gave it your best shot. Scrub in.
Okay.
I don't know.
It's okay. Take your time.
Truck.
Cabin.
Remember the third word, Mom?
We should've come earlier.
She has a harder time in the evenings.
She's doing fine. We're just running some tests.
It's "spoon," Mom.
Remember, "spoon"?
I don't know why we're here.
Why are we here?
It's such a little word.
Can we go home now?
Okay, Mom.
Okay.
He's gonna be sore for a while.
You'll need to make sure he drinks plenty of water.
Dr. Grey.
Is he okay?
He's fine.
Uh, Lexie.
Will you please just make sure that he calls me?
Yes, of course.
Thank you.
I'm almost five years sober.
We support each other,
and... I'm good for him.
And he is really,
really good for me.
Is that a hooker on your shoulder?
I was drunk.
Okay.
There he is.
How you feeling, buddy?
Can't straighten it out any more.
Ah, there's his surgeon.
You're the man, Dr. Hunt. How'd he do?
Okay, Randy, since there was a tear in your joint capsule,
we needed to open up the hip to reduce it.
We put a rod and screws into the other femur to fix that
and reduced the other hip.
And this piece of hardware
is keeping your wrist fracture together.
That's intense.
Is that, like, some sort of record or something?
Like the worst case you've ever seen?
Um, no. No, no. The worst case I ever saw
was a guy who had an ex fix in his arm like this one,
but he also had a gaping hole with exposed bone
that needed to be covered.
He also had a matching hole
that, uh, ripped through his back
and tore his stomach apart.
Needed 11 surgeries to reconstruct his abdomen.
He survived all that?
No. No, he didn't.
But, you know, come to think of it,
your situation, it is actually worse.
Mm-hmm. How?
Well, that guy--he threw himself in front of a grenade
to save six other soldiers.
He didn't launch himself into a brick wall
so the internet could laugh at him.
Turn the camera off, Marcus.
Chief.
You know, I had forgotten this about your mother.
She wrote everything down.
She didn't have a thought or a fragment of a thought
that didn't get scribbled in some journal.
She was compulsive. Lucky for you that she did.
Lucky for both of us.
No, for you.
You knew the woman who wrote them.
That's why I gave them to you.
I was happy to read them and to understand her better,
but the woman I knew was different.
But I am starting to realize how scared she must have been.
that had to be why she was writing everything down.
She must have been so scared.
Meredith, I--
So please, go ahead.
I think it's right that you continue her work.
But I really just want to cure her disease.
Good night, Chief.
Good night.
So...
what's your plan?
Sleep.
My plan for tonight is sleep.
I was gonna hit joe's before heading home.
You wanna come?
I just need to crash.
Yeah. No, I get that.
Maybe tomorrow.
For sure. Yeah.
Sorry about your patient.
Thanks. I'm happy for yours.
Hey, you want to get a--
No.
Right.
We made dinner... for you.
What is it?
Um, grilled chicken breast
and some brown rice and broccoli...
And--is that coffee?
Yes, it is.
And here's the thing--
I get that things are gonna be different now.
And, uh, that's why I'm gonna eat that chicken
even though the only thing I want right now
is a peanut butter sandwich.
Great. I'm really happy--
Oh, I'm not done.
If we're gonna do this whole "everybody gets a vote" thing,
there's gonna be a new system.
We'll still each get one vote,
but also, the baby gets a vote.
As I house the baby, I'll be speaking for him/her.
And since I'll be pushing this baby
out of a very small hole in my body,
I'll also get an extra-special vagina vote.
So that's, uh, three votes for us, two votes for you guys.
Oh, we get the final say.
Now I'll be using my many votes to say that once a day,
I will have one cup of regular coffee, which is perfectly fine
according to the studies that I've read,
at least until I begin breaeast-feeding.
Now anybody want to argue with my extra-special vagina vote? .
No No, thank you.
Great.
Oh, we also vote that Mark gives me a foot rub.
I'll go get the lotion.
Okay, well, I guess that a peanut butter sandwich
is doable if you eat the broccoli.
Deal.
Surgery is a high-stakes game.
Did you decide?
I did.
I choose you.
I'm glad.
I've been going over the data you collected today.
And so far,
it is 100% consistent with the pretrial phase.
Which means what?
It means that it's not not working.
Oh. That's great news.
You wanna know what else is great news?
What?
Kids won't be home for another 20 minutes.
And no matter how high the stakes
sooner or later you are just gonna have to go with your nut.
And maybe, just maybe,
