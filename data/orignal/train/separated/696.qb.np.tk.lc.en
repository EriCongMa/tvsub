oh , god .
the coroner ruled it an accident .
this dark chapter in our lives is finally over .
we can move on .
i don &apos;t know if i can .
let him go , niko .
he &apos;s guilty of killing my father , lying to me about it .
emily , no ! she doesn &apos;t deserve to die .
i &apos;ve been blacking out .
get help before you do something else you regret .
so , you &apos;re conrad &apos;s first wife ?
we all make mistakes , right ?
this house belongs to me .
i own this place ,
and i want you out by the end of the week .
jack , i &apos;m your mother .
what is going on with you , ems ?
blackouts ?
i lashed out at you . i jeopardized aiden &apos;s life .
i &apos;m starting to go after the wrong people , nolan .
what am i gonna do ?
we spend our lives
struggling to hold on to the things we value most ...
to the people and things
we believe we could never exist without .
but our memories are often an illusion ...
protecting a far more destructive truth .
they &apos;re considering an all @-@ cash offer ?
did you tell them that i have a little boy ?
fine .
bye .
house hunting in this market &apos;s tough , huh ?
i &apos;m just trying to get on with my life .
is that why you haven &apos;t returned my calls in the past three days ?
jack , i just ...
i &apos;d like for you to hear me out .
i wondered why i &apos;d never seen any photos of me
as a newborn with my mom .
i said goodbye and ...
i left you with your father a week after ...
that picture was taken .
he sent mementos over the years --
your artwork and sailing ribbons .
he made it possible to bear being away .
i &apos;m glad he made it easy .
it was never easy , jack .
and i ...
i can &apos;t make up for the time we lost .
so why try now ?
it &apos;s complicated .
i think it &apos;s best if we keep our lives to ourselves .
man never had it easy ,
and , sure , he made his mistakes .
but he always rose above ,
and we stood by him , just like he stood by us .
yeah , he did .
so , here &apos;s to you , jimmy .
taken too soon ,
but we know you &apos;re throwing back with saint peter now .
cheers .
cheers .
guy had you all fooled .
you got something to say , pal ?
jimmy brennan was a rapist
who deserves to be exactly where he is right now --
rotting in a box .
you &apos;re packing up .
good to see you know when to surrender .
well , that word &apos;s not in my vocabulary .
these are simply pieces on loan for the hamptons art walk .
i have no intention of going anywhere .
yet this property belongs to me .
well , that is a rather tenuous claim ,
as you &apos;ve neither set foot on nor paid taxes for this land
in all your years away .
oh , your lawyer &apos;s advised you to deny me access
with the claim of abandonment -- clever .
but if he were really sharp ,
he &apos;d know that i was defrauded title
since conrad hid ownership from me .
decades later , you &apos;re still that man &apos;s pawn .
what i am , victoria ,
is the legal owner of this house ,
which i intend to raze to the ground .
oh , stevie ,
you and i both know the only thing
guaranteed to crumble is you .
nolan ?
god . next time i agree to chair an art walk , please --
it happened again .
what do you mean ?
what do you think ?
one second , i &apos;m at grayson manor ,
and the next , i come to on my porch with this .
what the hell did you do ?
destroyed my father &apos;s carving .
at least it wasn &apos;t someone .
this time .
i thought you had these blackouts under control .
yeah , so did i.
i need to figure something out .
emily , maybe it &apos;s time --
don &apos;t tell me to go to a doctor !
all right , then i &apos;ll help you .
we &apos;ll leave town .
we &apos;ll go anywhere .
no , i need to finish what i started .
how can you if you cannot even trust yourself ?
look , for starters , why don &apos;t you put the knife down ?
you can &apos;t let this destroy you .
i won &apos;t .
ems .
emily , wait .
what are you gonna do ?
what i should &apos;ve done in the first place .
i &apos;m gonna kill them all .
第三季 第十五集
i &apos;m all right .
no , patrick , you &apos;re not .
why would you go to jimmy &apos;s wake ?
expose him for the bastard that he was .
and allow yourself to be beaten bloody by a bunch of thugs ?
you &apos;re going to get yourself killed .
well , maybe i should .
you don &apos;t honestly believe that .
i don &apos;t know what i believe anymore .
believe that i love you ...
that jimmy got what he deserved , and that we need to move on .
don &apos;t let your rage consume you .
it might be too late .
well , since you won &apos;t return my phone calls ,
i figured i &apos;d use my &quot; find a former friend &quot; app .
i &apos;m just -- i &apos;m trying to get out of town .
but i know why you &apos;re still here .
emily &apos;s in trouble .
look , she almost had me killed ,
so if you &apos;re looking for me to save her , i pass .
you can &apos;t help somebody who doesn &apos;t want it .
really ? because from what i remember ,
you were an unfocused disaster when emily rescued your ass
and brought you to takeda .
believe me , if he were still alive , i would go to him .
you &apos;re the only one that can reach her now .
no one can reach emily .
she &apos;s got the strongest will i &apos;ve ever known .
had .
she &apos;s broken down , she &apos;s out of control .
she said she &apos;s going to kill all the graysons .
then let her . that &apos;s what i would &apos;ve done .
you &apos;re not listening to me .
she &apos;s about to do something she will not come back from ever .
i was surprised you called .
the graysons are notorious for using the same old fossils .
those private investigators are loyal to my parents .
i want someone interested
in building a relationship with a new regime .
thought you just needed me tailing someone .
for now , i do .
i assume you &apos;re familiar with my wife .
she disappears at odd hours , doesn &apos;t come home ...
and may be conspiring with my father .
you want a tail for him , too ?
&apos;cause that would require extra manpower .
i &apos;ve got him covered .
no , no , no . i don &apos;t need to think about it .
my answer is no .
you , on the other hand , i &apos;m glad i said yes to .
these are the reports you wanted ,
but i didn &apos;t have access to some of the financials you asked for .
oh , that &apos;s all right , sweetheart .
i can get those myself .
who was that on the phone ?
no one who would interest you .
try me .
that was a representative from a hedge fund
interested in buying my stake in voulez
at an amateurishly inflated price .
and why say no ?
because , my dear , you can &apos;t put a price tag
on working alongside your own daughter .
and my interest in this endeavor is just starting to pique .
now , as voulez &apos;s emissary at today &apos;s art walk ,
i need to go home and slip into something more creative .
daddy , please don &apos;t start calling the southfork home .
it makes me sad .
oh , really ?
well , i &apos;m the happiest i &apos;ve been in ages .
what the hell are you doing ?
don &apos;t worry . you &apos;re safe .
from who ?
from yourself .
attempting to kill conrad in his suite with no cover ,
o exit strategy .
i had no choice .
how many times have you told me that murder is not the answer ?
i &apos;m out of options . untie me , aiden .
you &apos;re desperate .
you &apos;re flailing around in the dark without a plan .
when you were shot , it set something free in your mind .
it &apos;s consuming you .
and , what , you &apos;re gonna try to snap me out of it ?
i &apos;m gonna make you deal with it .
takeda had ways of reaching your subconscious before .
don &apos;t you dare .
as chair of the cultural arts board ,
i want to thank you all for your participation .
you have your assignments ,
so let &apos;s have a great event .
i was just at the marina .
it looks beautiful , nolan .
worthy of having stefano leone as our v.i.p. guest .
as one of his original benefactors ,
i thought it was only fitting
to have the master grace us with his presence .
jealous , vicky ?
i mean , i guess that &apos;s the difference
between you and i in the art world .
you collect , and i connect .
frankly , i &apos;m surprised
you showed up to this meeting at all .
unlike yourself , i have little interest
in playing dilettante with these women .
i &apos;m here to have a conversation with you alone .
well , hang on a sec while i hide all the blunt objects .
i mean , that is how you and your kind
prefer to deal with me .
do you have any idea what your spiteful retaliation
did to my son ?
hopefully create an irreparable rift between you two .
well , then , you &apos;ll be disappointed to
learn that your plan didn &apos;t work .
the only thing meeting his father accomplished
was to destroy patrick .
i &apos;m sorry .
you expect me to feel guilty for
helping patrick find his father ?
jimmy brennan was a horrible , violent man .
and patrick learned that he was born
from an unspeakable circumstance .
i hid the truth to protect my son ,
and now , because of your childish , myopic games ,
patrick thinks he &apos;s unworthy of love .
i didn &apos;t know .
and in your arrogance , you didn &apos;t care .
my son is on the precipice .
his life is at risk ,
and the blame rests squarely on your narrow shoulders , mr. ross .
i &apos;m not sure how much longer i &apos;ll be .
come on in . it &apos;s open .
right .
no matter what i decide to do with grayson manor ,
i &apos;m prepared to force an eviction .
i &apos;ll call you back .
i got a call from my realtor today .
seems the house i was about to lose
is now mine if i want it .
that &apos;s wonderful .
i asked what made the owners change their minds , and ...
he said they &apos;d received an e @-@ mail on my behalf
from a top attorney ,
one who talked about how my kid and i deserve my dream home
after the difficult life that i &apos;ve had .
i wanted to help .
why ?
i mean , if my dad sent you this stuff ,
then you knew that we were on hard times before .
please .
let me just do this for you .
you know what my last memory of the woman who raised me is ?
the giant breakfast that she made me .
it was eggs and bacon , pancakes .
and ice cream .
could never figure out why
until my dad told me that she &apos;d left us .
i &apos;m not doing this out of guilt .
come on . how could you not be ?
unless you really are a grayson ,
since i know they never feel it .
i am nothing like them .
i &apos;m sorry you feel that way .
i know , uh , you &apos;ve got a long history of popping by my place ,
so i decided i &apos;d return the favor .
besides , knew it was the only way you &apos;d see me .
you shouldn &apos;t be here , nolan .
look .
i know we have been through the ringer ,
but , uh , i had no idea who your father was
when i dropped that bomb .
so , if you did know , that would &apos;ve stopped you ?
yeah ... patrick , it would have .
but i &apos;m starting to wonder what , if anything ,
will stop you .
i read about jimmy &apos;s death .
i don &apos;t know , should we call it a murder ?
they ruled that an accident .
i know ,
which is fast becoming a euphemism for &quot; patrick did it . &quot;
so , let me ask you , how many people did you kill
before you came to the hamptons ? &apos; cause my guess is zero .
don &apos;t stand there and act so innocent , nolan .
we both know you &apos;re not .
i don &apos;t have blood on my hands .
wait , so does victoria pick the victims ,
or are you just scoring points with mommy ?
you got no idea what she &apos;s been through , so stop attacking her .
or what ? i &apos;ll have an accident next ?
you &apos;ve totally changed .
you don &apos;t even see it .
you really think you know me , don &apos;t you ?
you don &apos;t .
i know you used to be an artist .
and i know you &apos;ve got a booth at the art walk
that &apos;s currently sitting empty ,
and i know that stefano leone will be disappointed .
stefano leone &apos;s gonna be there ?
i set it up back when we were dating .
i , uh , wanted it to be a surprise .
patrick ...
i wanted good things for you , and
call me crazy ...
mm , i still do .
but since i forgot that you can &apos;t do anything
that victoria doesn &apos;t sanction ,
i will send stefano your regrets .
that &apos;s not gonna work !
only by stripping away the body can we then focus on your mind ,
and by shedding that , your soul .
you &apos;ll never be takeda .
you think i want to be here ?
i only came back because you destroyed us ,
and i won &apos;t let that be for nothing .
i didn &apos;t ask for your help .
god . you &apos;re ungrateful .
you don &apos;t even know who your allies are anymore .
but i know who my enemies are .
who , the graysons ?
then why didn &apos;t your blackouts harm them ?
no , instead , you went after nolan and me .
you &apos;re misdirecting your anger .
i think the person you &apos;re truly angry at is yourself ,
but you won &apos;t admit it .
go to hell .
emily ?
my father ...
he &apos;s to blame for everything .
paul charney .
or should i say &quot; your honor &quot; now ?
enjoying a respite before the fall term ?
to be honest , stevie ,
i just heard some disturbing news .
paul and i were discussing your plans to level grayson manor .
i &apos;ve actually changed my mind .
now i &apos;m thinking it could be put to better use as a halfway house .
the manor is an architectural treasure .
and paul is the chairperson
of the south hampton historical commission .
he wants to see to it that it &apos;s protected by national landmark laws .
which means it can &apos;t be used as a treatment center
or anything else .
a landmark needs to meet half a dozen historical criteria
to be registered .
i hardly think grayson manor qualifies ,
unless there &apos;s a value in the legacy of tabloid scandals .
careful , stevie .
you &apos;re no stranger to scandal , either .
see you in court .
well , it seems it &apos;s not just me you &apos;ll be fighting with .
it &apos;s funny . i wouldn &apos;t think you &apos;d need so much help .
are you ready to talk ?
untie me , please .
it was my father all along .
that &apos;s why you defaced the carving he made for you .
or was it something more ?
he carved it the morning he was taken .
why that day ?
i don &apos;t know .
i think i was in trouble for something .
are you certain that it was your father ? try and remember , emily .
it was the night before he was taken .
victoria .
she was saying she wanted to run away with him .
he didn &apos;t see me , but she saw me in the shadows .
she gave me this look .
you already told me all this .
be brave enough to go deeper .
i knew she couldn &apos;t be trusted .
i just wanted to make sure he was okay .
david .
david !
get out !
amanda , stop !
no , no !
no .
stop ! stop ! stop !
let me go ! you yelled at me !
what &apos;s she doing here ? i don &apos;t like her ! she hates me !
why would you say that ? you don &apos;t even know her yet .
no , tell her to go away now !
i &apos;m not gonna do that , amanda . i love her , and you will , too .
no , she &apos;s not my mom .
hey . hey . your mom is gone .
you have to accept victoria ,
because we are gonna be a family .
he got his wish .
i &apos;m a grayson now .
emily .
why didn &apos;t he listen to me ?
why ?
everything could &apos;ve been different .
it could &apos;ve been ...
it &apos;s okay .
patrick ?
hi .
well , after this morning , i didn &apos;t think you would come .
well , i , you know , figured forcing myself out
might help me shake whatever it is i &apos;m feeling , so ...
it &apos;s important that you stop torturing yourself
about the past and start living in the present ...
... because there are always problems to be dealt with .
something wrong ?
oh , nothing that you need to worry about .
let &apos;s focus on putting your artwork up , yeah ?
mom , why don &apos;t you just tell me what &apos;s going on ?
stevie grayson .
she &apos;s proving to be more tenacious
at the pursuit of our home than i thought .
you got the city council on your side , right ?
well , they &apos;re no match for her legal acrobatics .
to think that when she and conrad were together ,
she was nothing but a socialite enjoying the high life .
what changed her ?
i did .
after conrad left her for me , it must &apos;ve been a wake @-@ up call .
but if she thinks that i &apos;m going to tolerate her insolence ,
she &apos;s wrong .
there are other ways to deal with her .
what are you trying to say ?
that if i created this beast ,
don &apos;t you think it &apos;s time i slay it ?
mom , i need to know what it is you &apos;re planning to do .
i won &apos;t go into the details here .
today is about you and your work , all right ?
i finally remember what i did during my blackouts .
it &apos;s all because of that one memory .
that &apos;s why i was sabotaging everything .
because you didn &apos;t think he was worth it .
with everything that happened with my father , i understand .
you &apos;re the only person who knew how to save me .
i &apos;m not sure i deserve it .
you do .
and so does your father .
the only mistake he made was ...
... falling for the wrong woman .
which means i still need to clear his name .
now , that &apos;s the emily i know .
now , you finish what you started .
you make them pay for what they &apos;ve done .
the brush strokes are a bit heavy ,
but i think maybe that was intentional .
uh , mr. leone . it &apos;s an honor , sir .
an honor would be an answer to my question .
right . uh ...
honestly , i was trying to --
was trying to ram the paint through the canvas that day ,
which never really leads to good art , does it ?
but the talent is there .
i understand you run a gallery .
uh , with my mother , yes . i do , yeah .
well , then , this may not interest you ,
but i &apos;ve been looking for an apprentice in my tuscan studio .
the pay is minimal , and the hours are long .
uh , i ...
i don &apos;t know what to say .
just consider it .
finally feel like talking ?
yeah .
good . come here for a second .
now , you know , we all make mistakes , amanda .
i &apos;m sorry that we fought and that you got scared .
i , uh , never want that for you .
right .
daddy , what are you doing ?
right now , it all looks really bad , right ?
yeah .
but you and i -- we can fix any problem .
when this is done , it &apos;s gonna be a reminder
that no mistake is ever gonna break us apart .
as long as you never forget i love you .
emily ?
jack , hey .
can i , uh ...
can i talk to you for a minute ?
of course .
when your mom showed up , did you get a chance to talk to her ?
i mean ... honestly ?
i wish i could have .
why ?
&apos;cause my mother just came back ,
and i &apos;m not really sure what to do about it .
what ?
you haven &apos;t seen her in 20 years .
actually , i &apos;m not talking about the person that i &apos;ve been pissed off
at this whole time for bailing on me and dec.
what do you mean ?
stevie grayson is my biological mother .
what ?
she had an affair with my dad ,
and she left town , hid the pregnancy from conrad ,
then my dad and mom raised me as their own .
stevie grayson ?
are you sure ?
what else did she say ?
just , you know , that it was hard to let me go ,
but i @-@ i can tell that she &apos;s holding something back .
and if she &apos;s this closed off already ,
i don &apos;t see the point in making an effort .
well , if this is true ...
... she &apos;s the only parent you &apos;ve got .
and , yeah , she made a mistake years ago , but ...
... maybe you should give her a chance .
just please be careful .
and , jack ...
... thanks for giving me a chance , too .
it means a lot .
mom , this is really hard for me to say .
but , uh ...
you know that when you hurt , i hurt , too .
and the problem is , when someone hurts you ...
... i become someone i barely recognize ,
someone who will ...
strike out to protect the one person i value most .
and i know now where that darkness comes from .
it comes from my father .
i feel like if i stay here , others will suffer , too .
i &apos;ve been given an opportunity ,
one that i think will make you proud of me .
but it means i have to leave here .
and i hate doing this the way that i &apos;m doing it ,
but i can &apos;t look in your eyes .
if i did , i would waver .
i really hope you understand .
goodbye , mom . i will always love you .
have you heard the news ?
pascal lemarchal is on his way from paris .
oh , i didn &apos;t know you were such a fan .
well , i &apos;m not , really ,
but he &apos;s one of the biggest media moguls in the world ,
and he &apos;ll be in these offices tomorrow .
right on schedule .
that &apos;s why you challenged margaux &apos;s authority .
you knew she &apos;d have to go to the board .
which meant running home to papa ,
and i knew he couldn &apos;t resist engaging me on his daughter &apos;s behalf .
but why do you want mr. lemarchal here ?
oh , well , charlotte , i could tell you ,
or , if you want to see how the business of power works ,
you could take a ringside seat .
sign me up .
jack .
the only time i &apos;ve missed out on my kid &apos;s life
is when things were truly messed up ,
so whatever it was that made you stay away ,
it must &apos;ve been bad , but ...
i guess i just wanted to make sure it wasn &apos;t because of me or my dad .
it wasn &apos;t .
i was actually trying to protect you from who i was then .
when i lived here ,
i couldn &apos;t exist without a drink in my hand ,
hence my time at your bar and with your father .
but now i &apos;m sober , coming up on 20 years .
i was , um ...
i was in rehab for the first time when i found out i was pregnant .
but after i had you , i realized ...
i couldn &apos;t be a decent mother
until i learned how to take care of myself ,
which took longer than i expected .
it was 30 years .
i know .
the hamptons are full of triggers for me ,
the greatest being conrad and victoria .
well ... that , i can understand .
but still , why now ?
i was ready to face them ...
and you .
then how about this ?
how about you come over to my house tomorrow ,
officially meet your grandson ?
i would like nothing more .
i thought brunello appropriate to ...
honor the next chapter of patrick &apos;s life .
please thank stefano again for affording him the opportunity .
you were the one that made him an offer he couldn &apos;t refuse ,
but ...
in truth , even without the money ,
he thinks your boy has talent .
of course he does .
maybe now , patrick can rid his heart of all the hurt
and hatred that clouded it during his time here .
your plan worked , victoria .
you did the right thing .
it sickens me that the only way to save patrick
was to let him think i was a monster who wanted stevie grayson dead .
what ? no snappy rejoinder ?
none needed .
you let me help break your heart .
don &apos;t tell me yours doesn &apos;t hurt , too .
to patrick .
to my son .
i assume you have information on my wife .
it wasn &apos;t as difficult to track as you led me to believe .
was she with my father ?
i think you &apos;re testing the wrong theory .
she actually broke into his room at the southfork .
why ?
i don &apos;t know what her plan was .
about 30 seconds later , some guy came in after her .
i had to duck behind a wall so he didn &apos;t see me .
the next thing i know , they &apos;re gone .
so you lost them ?
i came out to the service entrance
and caught a plate as he drove off .
fed the specs to a couple buddies in the force ,
and a couple hours later , they found his car .
you &apos;ve seen him before .
and i never thought i &apos;d be happy to see him again .
i &apos;m glad it worked out .
i finally , uh , understand why she was scared .
turns out she &apos;s a recovering alcoholic .
the graysons aren &apos;t exactly her favorite people .
well , it &apos;s good that she opened up .
duty calls .
good night , emily .
good night .
sprucing up the cottage ?
that &apos;s a good sign .
how you feeling ?
better .
yeah ?
yeah , i think i finally have a handle on all this .
now that you &apos;ve sent your demons packing ,
is danny next ?
not until i know what my next step is ,
but it will be good to have a refuge from grayson manor .
consider this a house re @-@ warming .
and ...
only your touch can open it .
thank you , nolan ...
for this ...
and for sending aiden today .
i almost lost everything .
yeah , i hoped he &apos;d come through for you .
so , i think this calls for a toast .
i &apos;m thinking ... gin martinis ?
gin martinis ?
turns out she &apos;s a recovering alcoholic .
gin in her breath .
i don &apos;t get many visitors , but when i do ,
it gives me a moment of hope within the struggle .
because i think maybe you &apos;ll walk through that door
having forgiven me .
i had that hope today .
mr. clarke .
i &apos;m a lawyer , and i &apos;m interested in your case .
i wanted to believe her ,
but that &apos;s when i noticed the gin on her breath .
a few days later , i found out
that she &apos;d been disbarred for drinking .
but i still cherish the one moment of hope i had that day ,
because that hope is you , amanda .
it always is .
ems ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
a lawyer disbarred .
i think stevie grayson visited my father in prison .
what do you think she wanted ?
i don &apos;t know .
but she came here with secrets .
i &apos;m gonna find out every single one .
