hello .
hello , sir . i just wanted to remind you
that our normal checkout time is 11 a.m.
but if you &apos;d like a later checkout time ,
i can go ahead and take care of that for you now .
sir , would you like a later checkout time ?
sir ?
hello ?
are you there ?
no . no .
hello ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing .
well , it &apos;s not sunday . we talk on sunday .
i know . i , um , i just thought i &apos;d call .
you scared me .
sorry .
i thought it was an emergency .
no , it &apos;s not an emergency .
yeah ? are you sure ?
how are your headaches ?
good . i mean-- i mean they &apos;re gone .
yeah ? are you taking your riboflavin and the magnesium ?
in equal doses and a sporadic shot of b2 like you said .
and sleep ? are you letting your gray matter rest ?
i &apos;m--i &apos;m working on it .
what &apos;s so funny ?
what ? i didn &apos;t laugh .
something &apos;s amusing you . i can hear it .
you can hear my body language ?
i &apos;m a very good listener .
i guess i just-- i think it &apos;s funny
how we &apos;ve been doing this for 6 months and we &apos;ve never met .
you know , like one google search of me
and you &apos;ll find my fbi file photo ,
but i have absolutely no idea what you look like .
i &apos;ve shaved , by the way , since then .
i used to be sort of fascinated with the yeti ,
and i thought that maybe if i--
i don &apos;t know what you look like either .
really ?
no .
the only intimate part of you i &apos;ve seen is your brain
when i studied the mri you sent me .
that &apos;s when i said ,
this is a guy i need to get to know .
thanks . that &apos;s really nice of you to say .
what happened ?
something just happened .
sorry . it &apos;s work . i actually have to go .
ok . well , uh , we &apos;ll talk sunday .
be safe .
ok .
wait . are you being safe ?
yes . yes , i &apos;m being safe .
do you--do you think he knows about us ?
no . as far as i can tell he doesn &apos;t .
and we need to keep it that way .
well , my friends , you are heading to new mexico .
but pack your thermals ,
&apos;cause this case will make you go &quot; brr . &quot;
our unsub du jour is taking right legs .
the most recent victim , tony anders .
he was dumped at a local motel .
he &apos;s in surgery now . looks like he &apos;s gonna pull through .
the first victim , not so lucky .
richard hubbell .
he died during the leg absconding process ,
and his body was dumped just over the border in juarez , mexico .
juarez is on the front lines of the cartels .
any drug connections between the victims ?
they both just said no .
tony anders had i.v. bruising
and surgical sutures on his stump .
so the unsub operated on both victims .
we &apos;re looking at a doctor .
that &apos;s a first .
were the victims patients anywhere ?
no . they were the vision of health .
tony had hypodermic needle marks on his neck .
the unsub could have drugged him
and brought him into the hospital for surgery .
unlikely he could hide in a hospital .
even the most experienced surgeon
can &apos;t operate without supervision .
the goal of amputation is to remove dead tissue
to preserve an otherwise healthy limb .
any first @-@ year medical student will tell you that .
but this unsub stitched the skin flap so tightly
over tony &apos;s stump that it didn &apos;t allow for proper blood flow
and led to gangrene .
and he &apos;s not a surgeon .
what is he ?
a butcher .
what happened ?
everything &apos;s fine .
was there ...
was there an accident ?
it &apos;s fine . everything &apos;s fine .
we just need to operate .
operate ?
no , it &apos;s ok . it &apos;s ok . you &apos;re in good hands .
did someone call my wife ? she should know .
i will take care of it .
i should really call her , because she &apos;ll be worried .
i told you , we &apos;ll take care of it .
i , uh , have coverage .
my hmo hospital is st. mary &apos;s , i think .
保险公司才会报销相关费用 急诊情况下除外
is this-- am i at st. mary &apos;s ?
not quite .
hey , what are you doing ?
sir arthur conan doyle wrote ,
&quot; when a doctor does go wrong , he is the first of criminals .
he has the nerve and he has the knowledge . &quot;
so , this unsub &apos;s got a thing for right legs and he &apos;s moving fast .
two victims in a week . what &apos;s the compulsion ?
you know , the fact that one of the victims was left in a motel room
makes me think it &apos;s not a compulsion at all .
maybe it &apos;s black market .
what &apos;s the going rate for a leg these days ?
mm , pretty good .
in 2002 , tendons were shipped from south africa to the u.s.
and sold through private medical and biotech companies .
the body parts trade coexists
with the drug trade in border towns .
let &apos;s say it &apos;s a chop shop .
that means we &apos;re looking for a small team or network .
one that usually deals with the dead before the living .
did garcia find any overlap with victimology ?
just that they were both organ donors .
she &apos;s cross @-@ referencing with the united network for organ sharing .
u.n.o.s. deals with vital organs ,
but we &apos;re talking limbs .
yeah , but hospitals around the country are networked into it .
if the unsub is a medical professional , he might have access to it ,
and by extension , the victims .
reid , you and jj go to juarez
and look at richard hubbell &apos;s body .
morgan and dave , go talk to tony anders .
and blake and i will investigate the black market angle .
detective gonzalez .
i &apos;m glad you guys could make it .
i hate the weird ones .
i &apos;m agent hotchner . this is agent blake .
thanks for inviting us .
absolutely . come on in .
i &apos;ve got the board set up for you in here .
thank you .
thank you .
go ahead , garcia . you &apos;re on speaker .
ok , so i quadruple @-@ checked with u.n.o.s.
and there &apos;s no way the unsub is using them .
because like me , they quadruple @-@ check everything
and their redundancies have redundancies ,
and so there &apos;s no chance there could be any hanky @-@ panky .
he could still be using medical records to find them , though .
all right , thanks , garcia .
welcome , welcome .
were you able to contact the specialist we asked about ?
the doctor who sold on the black market ?
yeah . the prison said no way they would release him .
we &apos;ll just have to go to him , then .
i remember ...
walking out of organic chemistry , and ...
then ...
nothing .
what about when you woke up ?
there was a ...
beeping , like that .
and there was a mask ...
over my face , i think .
i can &apos;t remember , man . it &apos;s all a blur .
tony , do me a favor .
close your eyes .
just humor me , ok ?
all right .
think back to that room .
that bed .
that beeping .
it probably smelled a lot like this room .
you were out .
you should have stayed out .
but you didn &apos;t .
now ...
wake up !
tony , something just came to you .
what was it ?
i can &apos;t explain it .
don &apos;t think it , just say it .
it was a door .
a garage door .
i was in somebody &apos;s garage .
i need to , uh , ask you some questions .
if you want this to go well ,
i suggest you answer honestly .
have you eaten anything in the past 12 hours ?
uh , yeah .
have you consumed alcohol ?
no . just wait a--
you had surgery before ?
yes . please , just tell me--
any complications ?
no , no . it was lasik .
anything you &apos;d like to ask before we begin ?
why are you doing this to me ?
now , i &apos;m going to count backwards from 10 .
10 ...
please--please--
9 ...
8 ...
7 ...
6 ...
5 ...

good afternoon . i &apos;m alex blake with the fbi .
i &apos;m here to see if you can cooperate on this--
let me see the file .
right now it &apos;s just a missing limb case .
your expertise can tell us
if he &apos;s selling legs on the black market .
we felt that to find the best , we should go to the best .
can you help us , mr. smith ?
first of all , it &apos;s dr. smith ,
not mr. smith .
second ,
the only way i &apos;ll give you my expert opinion
is if we cut a deal , right now .
i could do that ...
or i could stop wasting my time with you .
this guy &apos;s not doing it for the money .
if you knew that for sure you wouldn &apos;t be here .
what i do know is what kind of medicine you practiced .
what do the eyes go for in beijing , a grand ?
the skin you sent to moscow , that netted you what , 15 ?
so when you looked at the last picture , i know what you saw .
you saw an amateur who could make a lot more money
if he took more than the right leg .
after all , you did .
listen , agent .
actually , it &apos;s doctor .
unlike you , i still have my degree .
but you have a good day , mr. smith .
it could be dumping the body down here
was a forensic countermeasure .
probably , but it &apos;s the deviation in m.o. that stumps me .
pun intended . two different victims , two different amputations .
all right , so what do you see , doctor ?
this amputation was transtibial ,
but the survivor was transfemoral .
so his leg was cut below the knee ,
and tony &apos;s was cut above .
the cutting here was pristine ,
nerve and vascular dissection was careful , well @-@ ligated .
i mean , this unsub definitely know what he was doing medically .
i thought you said the unsub wasn &apos;t a doctor .
i said he wasn &apos;t a surgeon ,
but his knowledge of anatomy and procedure
shows definite medical training .
hey , spence .
the hole in the bone-- it &apos;s perfectly circular .
the medical examiner said that was most likely caused by animals .
it &apos;s bored in . it &apos;s like he drilled it .
not with any surgical tool that i &apos;m familiar with .
well , maybe this is what he &apos;s been trying to hide from us .
based on the way this unsub treats his victims ,
we need to look at this case a different way .
we know it &apos;s not for profit and we know he &apos;s not a killer .
so what is he ?
a scientist , or at least he sees himself that way .
which means he sees his victims as test subjects .
and if we &apos;re right , we &apos;re not going to see
the usual signature or consistent victimology .
there &apos;s no compulsion , sexual or otherwise .
so there won &apos;t be a trigger or a stressor either .
that doesn &apos;t leave a lot to profile .
not true . we do have his medical technique .
and based on the remnants of hubbell &apos;s surgery ,
i think the unsub &apos;s experimenting .
with what ? a new way to amputate ?
the hole in his knee makes us think
it &apos;s more radical than that .
amputating the leg is not the unsub &apos;s goal .
reattaching it is .
you think this unsub &apos;s performing transplants ?
it explains why he only wanted tony anders &apos; leg .
i think that &apos;s the experiment .
he wants to see if he can put a foreign leg
on someone else &apos;s body .
can you--
can you help--
can you--can you help--
ma &apos;am , the doctor can &apos;t diagnose you over the phone .
ma &apos;am , i don &apos;t know what you want me to do .
you need to come in .
the doctor can &apos;t diagnose you over the phone .
please ... i need someone ...
no , ma &apos;am , i &apos;m sorry . you need to come in .
somebody help me !
hey , sir , what &apos;s your problem ?
it &apos;s my leg .
ok , does it hurt ?
no , it &apos;s been cut .
ok . can you get me some scissors ?
ok , what happened ? did you cut it ?
no .
it &apos;s not ...
my ... leg .
did the camera pick up anything ?
he dropped him off a block away .
this poor guy
limped into the hospital on a leg that wasn &apos;t his .
what &apos;s the note say ?
the unsub helpfully suggests
a high dose of cyclosporine for his patient ,
carl timmons .
it wouldn &apos;t have made any difference .
i mean , gangrene and sepsis had already set in .
there &apos;s nothing the hospital could have done .
reid , you getting a migraine ?
no . no , i haven &apos;t had one of those for months , ever since , um ...
this doesn &apos;t make any sense , morgan .
well , does it ever , reid ?
this unsub is supposed to have a background in science , right ?
why is his science so bad ?
he amputated carl &apos;s leg , sewed it up ,
and then reopened the sutures for transplant ?
you find anything on the knee ?
he left his handiwork in this time .
it &apos;s a surgical implant .
maybe that &apos;s what he was trying to perfect ,
transplanting the leg onto an amputee .
medically impossible .
you can &apos;t graft a leg onto someone else &apos;s stump .
well , you and i know that , and this guy must know that ,
but maybe he just won &apos;t stop until he succeeds .
a doctor that can &apos;t admit he &apos;s wrong ?
it &apos;s time to give the profile .
the unsub we &apos;re looking for
is a doctor with a severe god complex .
his narcissism makes him believe
that he can defy human biology and anatomy .
his narcissism has likely caused problems in his career .
so look for doctors who &apos;ve lost their licenses
or medical students who &apos;ve had ethical violations .
with a psychopath like this ,
shouldn &apos;t we also be looking at released mental patients ?
we don &apos;t think he is a psychopath .
psychopaths rarely have the training and discipline
for medical school or residency .
so this unsub won &apos;t behave in an antisocial manner .
he &apos;s probably successful , respectful , outgoing .
we think that he can maintain healthy relationships ,
and his neighbors probably know him well .
and his background makes us think
he lives a mid to upper class lifestyle .
he may be married and have kids .
if so , he would be devoted to both .
so don &apos;t look for the weirdo in the van with no windows .
look for the pillars of the community .
yeah , but if he &apos;s so well @-@ known ,
how &apos;s he hiding these operations from all these people ?
through a psychological process called doubling .
he acts one way professionally ,
but he acts another way at home .
it &apos;s occurred before in history .
like the nazi doctors in auschwitz and dachau .
they could separate their genocidal actions
from their normal lives as fathers , healers , and husbands .
and like the doctors under hitler &apos;s regime ,
this unsub &apos;s sense of superiority
supersedes the hippocratic oath .
yes , well , the trial phase is almost complete .
i &apos;ll , uh , i &apos;ll send it to you once i &apos;ve compiled it .
yes . yes , thank you .
that didn &apos;t sound good .
the investors want to see all my data .
and you &apos;re not ready .
i came close last night , but ...
i &apos;m in trouble .
ok , breathe , honey .
we &apos;re gonna get through this .
if they pull their funding--
they won &apos;t .
we lose everything .
the equipment in the garage , the house .
it &apos;s not going to happen .
how do you know that ?
because i know you .
but you have to let yourself off the hook
if you &apos;re gonna figure this out .
i almost had it , you know ?
that &apos;s what &apos;s so frustrating .
if i could just get it right one time ,
you and i can-- we can lead a better life .
honey , i have a great life .
don &apos;t worry about me .
worry about those little mice out in your lab .
well , i hate to tell you ,
but i &apos;ve moved up from mice in the last couple of weeks .
ok . whatever critters you have out there , i don &apos;t want to know .
but if it &apos;s a choice between them or the house ,
well , a couple more might have to give their life up to science .
oh , i love you so much .
stop worrying .
well , these are doctors and med students in the area ,
and there are a lot of washouts who fit the profile .
what about the prosthetic attachment from carl timmons &apos; leg ?
is there anything identifiable on it ?
i just sent you the chemical breakdown from our lab .
it &apos;s mostly a thick polymer
designed to withstand the constant mobility of the leg .
so the resin is coated in plastic ?
it &apos;s a combination of organic and inorganic materials .
that &apos;s probably to stave off rejection .
garcia , is the resin biodegradable ?
as a matter of fact , yes . how is it you know everything ?
all this time we assumed he &apos;s a doctor .
but what if he isn &apos;t ?
what if he has the training in cutting and stitching ,
but never went to medical school ?
where do you get training like that ?
i see .
so you think this man is a mortician .
it &apos;s one of the theories we &apos;re pursuing .
but we think this implant is the key to his training .
is this something your employees would use ?
yes . we use it for reattachment on our dearly beloved .
sometimes they come to us in more than one piece ,
and we need to perform some ... reassembly
for an open casket funeral .
the biodegradability is for what , cremation ?
precisely .
and unlike a surgeon ,
a mortician would want to reattach a limb at a movable joint
like a knee or an elbow ?
it &apos;s easier to use dead bone
than muscle or vasculature .
would you excuse me ?
thank you for your help .
of course .
so , we know the unsub got started in a place like this ,
but how &apos;s he finding his victims now ?
well , he &apos;s equipped his garage with medical equipment .
he might not be a doctor , but he could be posing as one .
look , i &apos;m sorry , but i can &apos;t remember
anyone like you &apos;re talking about .
now , just take a second and think .
is there any medical care that you &apos;ve had
that this guy could have had access to .
i haven &apos;t even been sick lately .
did you change doctors ?
what doctor ? i &apos;m in college .
how about student health services ?
or an outreach on campus , a health drive .
maybe you gave blood .
wait a second .
yeah . i give blood all the time .
when was the last time ?
a couple weeks ago .
it was a long line because there was just one guy in the truck .
what did the guy look like ?
i don &apos;t remember .
i was more focused on the needle going into my arm .
but you gave him your contact info , your medical history .
yeah . absolutely .
that &apos;s how he found you .
you said there was something wrong with my test ?
it &apos;s probably nothing .
we just need to take another sample .
help ...
what is wrong ?
help me .
please ... please ...
help me .
please .
i can &apos;t .
victim &apos;s name maria rodriguez .
first time he &apos;s operated on a woman .
he transplanted a left leg this time .
she died from blood loss .
there &apos;s no gangrene on the transplanted leg ,
which means the surgery &apos;s fresh .
you think he still has the other woman ?
it justifies his haste in dumping her here .
why didn &apos;t he go to the desert or a hospital ?
it also means he &apos;s speeding up his surgeries .
reid , where are you going ?
reid .
yeah , yeah , i &apos;m still combing through morticians .
garcia , i actually need something else .
can you tell me where the nearest pay phone is ?
sorry ?
pay phone .
like a phone you pay to make phone calls on .
oh , my sweet analog luddite .
that is what your cell is for .
garcia , please .
ok .
someone is being mysterious .
it &apos;s gonna take me a second .
pay phones have gone the way of the dodo birds .
they don &apos;t show up on google maps .
all right , try local telecoms .
yes , i know that . i &apos;m doing it right now .
and there is one 5 miles away .
i just texted it to your cell phone ,
which you can also use to call people .
thanks much .
alex .
blake , wait . where are you going ?
hotch called . he wants us back at the station asap .
can you give me a ride to 5th and main ? it &apos;s on the way .
uh ... yeah , sure . what &apos;s at 5th and main ?
i need to talk to somebody .
uh ... ok , sure .
what ...
what happened ?
you survived the surgery .
quite well , in fact .
surgery ? what are you--
oh , my god .
i know .
congratulations .
whose--whose leg is that ?
ah . she didn &apos;t survive the transplant .
but you did .
i can &apos;t ...
i can &apos;t move it .
you will , in a few days .
just relax .
now that i &apos;ve found a suitable match ,
i &apos;ll let you rest a little before we do the next one .
no .
no , wait .
please . please .
don &apos;t take my other leg !
please !
do you want me to wait ?
uh , you know , it might take a while ,
so i &apos;ll just take a cab back . thanks anyway .
what &apos;s the deal ?
something &apos;s not right , spencer .
what do you mean ? why did you come back ?
don &apos;t answer a question with a question .
look , a while back , i had some medical issues--
headaches--and there was a geneticist that i reached out to .
and this has to do with the case how ?
i think that my friend might be able to help me
see something that we missed .
you have 4 of the best minds i know back at the station .
i know , but sometimes a different perspective
helps me think better , ok ?
why are you being so ambiguous ?
i don &apos;t know what you mean ?
you &apos;re not using words like him or her .
you &apos;re saying things like &quot; they are , &quot;
&quot; my friends . &quot;
so ?
it begs a bigger question .
why did you ask me to bring you here ?
can we just talk about this later , please ?
no . why not morgan or jj ?
alex , please--
just answer the question !
because i don &apos;t want them to know about her .
ok ?
it &apos;s nothing bad , it &apos;s just personal .
ok .
i &apos;m here . i &apos;m here .
spencer , why are you calling me right now ?
i know . i know . it &apos;s important .
baby girl , what &apos;d you find ?
sorry , my love .
there &apos;s no overlap between morticians and bloodmobile techs .
most of them are volunteers .
if this guy &apos;s running his own rig ,
he &apos;s not gonna show up .
what are we missing ?
at first i just thought he was taking whoever was available .
except he &apos;s operating a bloodmobile .
yes , thank you , exactly .
that &apos;s not an accident .
he &apos;s obviously using it as a cover
to screen for something , and that &apos;s why i &apos;m calling you .
i &apos;m hoping that you can help me figure out
what he &apos;s screening for .
maybe the unsub is an amputee .
so he &apos;s working on a solution for his own condition .
the rest of the profile applies he &apos;s got a god complex .
he thinks he &apos;s perfect . infallible , even .
hard to maintain that if you &apos;re missing a leg .
it &apos;s almost ironic .
most amputees have a healthier psychology than this unsub .
you know , what you &apos;re describing reminds me of josef mengele .
为第三帝国创造出新的优等民族
yeah , we worked doubling into the profile .
no , i mean mengele &apos;s experiments on twins .
he operated on thousands of them . why ?
i don &apos;t know , actually .
he thought he could repopulate germany faster
if he could figure out a way
to get women to conceive with multiple embryos .
so you think this guy &apos;s pursuing his own impossible cause .
what if he &apos;s not trying to fix himself ,
but somebody else ?
that would fit his god complex .
like who ?
a spouse or a child , maybe .
someone he can ultimately heal by sacrificing these victims .
what is it ? everything ok ?
i need you to see something .
before he transplants , he turns them into amputees .
that &apos;s part of his experiment .
what if there &apos;s a condition the victim shares ,
something involving amputation ?
it doesn &apos;t make sense .
he couldn &apos;t screen for that genetically .
unless it &apos;s congenital ,
something that caused the amputation in utero ?
the way thalidomide caused birth defects in pregnant moms .
exactly . so i guess the question is ,
what else causes birth defects ?
that &apos;s a long list . chromosomal ,
fetal alcohol syndrome .
what if we focused on what causes limb deformities specifically ?
uh , rubella , herpes , among others .
herpes is most common ,
but it isn &apos;t screened for when you donate blood .
but there are a lot of different strains of herpes .
you know , chickenpox , for instance .
if a mother isn &apos;t inoculated
and she passes the virus in utero .
can &apos;t that cause birth defects ?
yeah . among other things ,
it can lead to limb hypoplasia .
the binding of which would appear similar to amputation .
but if it &apos;s a condition in the mother ,
why operate on men the first 3 times ?
those were trial runs .
now that he &apos;s operating on women ,
he thinks he &apos;s found an answer .
move .
move !
you ready ?
yeah .
ok .
ok .
honey , are you sure about this ?
i promise . this is everything we &apos;ve been working towards .
i &apos;m ready for you , you son of a bitch !
look .
there she is .
there who is ?
no .
john .
no !
no !
there who is ?
what are you operating on out here ?
i had a breakthrough .
one of my subjects survived , but she &apos;s gone !
she &apos;s gone .
people ?
you &apos;ve been doing this to people ? !
john !
john !
linda !
linda !
no ! help !
what &apos;s happening ?
garcia , did you get the mortician &apos;s records ?
ready and waiting .
isolate the married ones .
we &apos;re looking for limb deformities in the wife caused by chickenpox .
that &apos;s about as narrow as it gets .
eureka ! linda nelson , married to john nelson .
quit his job at the funeral home two months ago .
sending address now .
take rossi and jj . bring him in for questioning .
thanks .
put down the scalpel .
you come any closer and i take out her eye .
john ! john !
ok . ok . you win .
you win .
you can go .
go ahead .
ok ? you can walk right out of here .
but please , just-- don &apos;t hurt her .
go ahead .
you can just walk right out , ok ?
there &apos;s the door .
see ?
john ! john , stop it !
john , don &apos;t do this .
stop this !
this is my success , honey .
she showed me what i was doing wrong .
i don &apos;t care ! she &apos;s a human being .
fbi !
john nelson ,
put the needle down .
i have potassium chloride in this .
if you don &apos;t get out of here right now , this is a dead woman .
john , don &apos;t do this !
doctor , the experiment is over .
if you kill her , no one will see your work .
my work .
you don &apos;t understand .
i &apos;ve perfected this .
this is my last test .
drop it now !
then i can fix you .
i never wanted to be fixed .
linda .
you are the one that he loves .
you &apos;re the only one that can convince him
what he &apos;s doing is wrong .
john .
john , look at me .
it &apos;s over .
but ...
i can make you better .
i &apos;m not the one who &apos;s sick , john .
now drop the needle ...
or i &apos;ll tell them to shoot .
oh , john !
it &apos;s ok .
on your knees .
let &apos;s go .
&quot; body and soul cannot be separated for purposes of treatment ,
for they are one and indivisible .
sick minds must be healed as well as sick bodies . &quot;
dr. jeff miller .
ok , kid .
out with it .
out with what ?
out with the weirdness
and the secrecy .
that phone call that you could only make out of a phone booth .
i got a consultation . what &apos;s the big deal ?
reid , you left that crime scene
and came back with a major break .
that &apos;s one hell of a consult .
hmm . it was .
all right , you don &apos;t want to talk , that &apos;s fine .
but listen .
seriously , i--
i feel like you and i haven &apos;t had a chance to talk in a while .
it &apos;s nobody &apos;s fault . it happens .
but if you &apos;ve got somebody new in your life to talk to ...
i &apos;d just like to know who she is .
she &apos;s gotta be one hell of a woman to keep up with you .
who told you ?
oh , just a little birdie .
you might know her .
garcia told me .
and she says you have been acting a little squirrelly .
so i just filled the rest in .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
play on , playa .
thank you .
so i just wanted to say thank you .
you really helped a lot .
i can &apos;t believe we &apos;ve been able to talk this much .
3 times in one week . that &apos;s a new record .
i know . i like it . maybe we could test it out .
you know , talking more often .
or not .
uh , i have to go .
but why ?
no , it &apos;s nothing .
you &apos;re not the only one that can hear body language .
did i--did i say something wrong ?
i , um ...
i &apos;m just not sure it &apos;s safe for us to talk right now .
do you think it &apos;s going to be like this forever ?
i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s not how i want us to be , i know that .
my team and i are really good at what we do .
why can &apos;t you just let me help you ?
no , you can &apos;t ask that .
i can help you .
i &apos;m not doing this for me . i &apos;m doing this for you ,
because i cannot let him hurt you ,
because if he knew , he would--
please don &apos;t cry .
i get it . i get it , ok ?
this is--this is how it has to be .
i understand .
are you still there ?
yes . i &apos;m still here .
and , yes , this is how it has to be ,
for today , at least .
ok .
well , guess i &apos;ll talk to you next sunday .
bye .
