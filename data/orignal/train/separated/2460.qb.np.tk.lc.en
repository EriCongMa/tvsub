ric wants to bring jo back to life
with a stone that &apos;s filled with evil incarnate .
the phoenix stone .
bonnie , are you ok ?
there &apos;s something wrong with that stone .
we have to destroy it .
my mother &apos;s a lunatic ,
and everyone is too scared to stop her .
the deal has been made .
we don &apos;t mess with them , they don &apos;t mess with us .
what is valerie doing with stefan &apos;s journal ?
entry for july 15 , 1863 , should tell you why .
i met someone . her name is valerie ,
and she may be the most wonderful girl i have ever met .
she has elena .
and i &apos;m the only one who knows where she is .
she has caroline , she has elena .
this is her plan .
then we don &apos;t let her fracture us .
or we do . there were 4 heretics at the funeral .
dead malcolm makes 5,
but in 1903 , there were 6,
which means there &apos;s one more .
i &apos;m gonna find him , negotiate a trade .
we &apos;re gonna get them both back .
hello ?
tyler , it &apos;s stefan .
have you spoken to caroline ?
no , and please don &apos;t ask me to .
i have no desire to get mixed up in your drama with her .
listen to me . my scar opened up .
i don &apos;t have much time .
i need you to warn caroline .
she &apos;s not taking my phone calls .
ok . i &apos;m on it ,
but you should be running .
i &apos;m way ahead of you .
take care of yourself , tyler .
&quot; dear elena ... &quot;
&quot; not to dive into the bad news first ,
but there &apos;s a severe drought of good news lately ,
and , well , this sort of concerns you .
lily &apos;s hiding your coffin somewhere .
she promised to keep you safe
as long as damon stays out of mystic &quot; --
you seen my phone ?
i , uh , seen your empties , your dinner ,
your razor .
you know , clothes would be nice .
got it .
how long you planning on crashing here , damon ?
you know , you could compel yourself
a whole sorority house if you wanted to .
and miss this &quot; odd couple &quot; squalor ?
i &apos;m starting to enjoy the luxury of having
one barely functional showerhead
after years of being tortured by the 4
that i have in my actual home .
relax . it &apos;s just till we hunt down lily &apos;s
little lone wolf heretic and swap him out
for my girlfriend in a coma .
yeah , and , uh , how long until that happens , huh ?
pretty soon thanks to donovan--
a phrase no one has uttered ever .
he &apos;s checking lily &apos;s cell phone records .
hi , bon bon .
please tell me i &apos;m not interrupting something .
oh , trust me . you &apos;re not .
what &apos;s up ?
that phoenix stone that i touched yesterday ,
you did destroy it like you promised me , correct ?
why ? what happened ?
i just had another vision ,
a flash of horrified people with x @-@ shaped wounds on their skin ,
and when i opened my eyes ,
10 minutes had gone by .
the stone &apos;s gone . i , you know , watched it
dissolve in hydrofluoric acid .
you &apos;re positive ?
bonnie , the stone &apos;s gone .
who wants to go to myrtle beach ?
i &apos;m busy .
pass .
well , that &apos;s too bad because lily made a bunch of phone calls
that bounced off a cell tower there ,
and something tells me
she &apos;s not making plans for her spring break .
why would lily send one of her heretics to myrtle beach ?
tell you what . you ask him yourself
after he &apos;s safe in my car &apos;s trunk , hmm ?
so anyone up for an old @-@ fashioned hostage swap ?
does agreeing to go mean you putting on pants ?
i &apos;ll even give you shotgun .
valerie was like a fresh breath of air .
i &apos;d been suffocating and hadn &apos;t realized it .
thanks , nora and mary louise .
real classy .
i hate you both .
hello ?
caroline ?
stefan ? !
how are you on my phone right now ?
you must have dropped it when you got
threshold @-@ vacuumed out of here yesterday .
how are you ? are you ok ?
well , i &apos;m spelled into your room
by a menagerie of mean girls , but other than that--
i know . i &apos;m still trying
to figure out a way to get into the house .
i &apos;ll be fine . just keep damon
from killing any more heretics .
i will . lily &apos;s only keeping you there to turn me against damon .
i &apos;ll convince her that i hate his guts ,
and she &apos;ll have made her point .
who &apos;s valerie tulle ?
you wrote about her in your journal from 1863 .
she must have found a copy in the prison world .
are you talking about one of the heretics ?
yeah . dirty blond hair , blue eyes .
she &apos;s one of my new psycho housemates .
caroline ?
dirty blond hair , blue eyes , psycho .
summarized me to a tee .
caroline ?
you can take my town , you can destroy my house ,
but you will not touch my car .
good morning , stefan .
what are you doing ?
i was out practicing my driving
and saw an opportunity to work on my parallel parking .
must have run over a nail or something .
the streets around here are a disgrace .
listen . you need to tell those spoiled brats living in my house
to stop torturing caroline .
of course . as soon as you tell your brother
to stop killing said spoiled brats .
damon and i aren &apos;t speaking right now .
really ?
i have no idea where he is .
apparently , you did both of us a favor
when you told him to leave town .
then i will give a lecture to the girls on their manners .
is one of those girls named valerie tulle ?
i was wondering when you might put those pieces together .
i knew valerie years before you did .
she worked in my tb ward .
after i turned , i took her under my wing .
if memory serves me , you didn &apos;t meet her until 1863 .
how would you know that i met her ?
because , stefan , i sent her to you .
you have to move .
excuse me ?
your sad mood is spoiling the fun for everyone .
i &apos;m valerie tulle .
stefan salvatore .
are you new to town ?
just passing through .
i hope not too fast .
how do you have this ?
nora gave it to me .
what was the deal with you and stefan ?
wouldn &apos;t you like to know ?
you know what ? you &apos;re right .
i &apos;m already in enough pain .
the last thing i need to think about
is some girl who batted her eyelashes at stefan ,
like , a million years ago .
&quot; some girl . &quot;
i wasn &apos;t just some girl to him , caroline .
i was the first love of stefan &apos;s life .
why did you send valerie to me ?
to check on you .
like any mother longing for her children ,
i was in a black hole of depression .
yes , stefan . i &apos;m more than the cold @-@ hearted snake
you and your brother wish me to be .
it took me a long time to get over losing you .
anyway , i had been invited to travel to europe
with a--a vampire gentleman friend of mine ,
but i refused to leave until i knew that my boys were ok .
a gentleman friend .
you had a boyfriend ?
his name was julian . what ? you &apos;re acting as if that &apos;s absurd .
well , your first husband shot and killed his own son ,
so you &apos;ll have to excuse me if i don &apos;t trust your type .
julian was nothing like your father .
no . what was he , a nebbishy banker ,
town butcher perhaps ?
julian was the man you are not supposed to fall for ,
so of course i did .
for the soldiers !
yes !
have your tickets ready , ladies .
the men on the battlefield need us .
hello .
you have to hold still .
it will be delicious , i promise .
aren &apos;t we ladylike ?
stefan , meet julian .
your daughter and i were just appreciating
the scientific wonder of gravitational force .
how wise you must sound to less intelligent men .
julian is not my father .
ah , my apologies . i just assumed--
incorrectly as it turns out .
valerie darling , a word .
you &apos;re wrinkling my dress , julian .
what are you doing ?
lily sent us here to get a sense of his mood .
exactly . his mood , not his manhood .
remember , his mother gave very strict instructions
for us to keep our distance .
do not displease her .
i have everything under control .
i was lying .
i wasn &apos;t prepared for how taken i was with him .
he was gorgeous and sweet .
and that &apos;s when you compelled him
to write all those nice things about you in his journal .
spoiler !
i &apos;ve heard this story before
when a sweet , little orphan girl
named katherine pierce waltzed into his life .
i suppose that would have been easier
had i actually had the ability to compel people .
i wasn &apos;t a vampire back then .
i was just a witch rejected from her coven
for being an abomination of nature
because i had no power of my own .
the only magic i had was contained in an amulet
to be siphoned in times of need .
i have a brother who &apos;s away at war ,
a father who judges me for not joining him ,
and a mother who was strong and kind .
she died when i was 10 .
i &apos;m so sorry .
oh , it was a long time ago .
there &apos;s no shame in missing her ,
a man on the outside with the heart of a boy .
there are worse things .
your chaperone is quite persistent .
then we shall elude him .
come .
what are you doing ?
invisique .
how did he not see us ?
would you believe me if i said magic ?
and then ...
none of your business .
i know why you put that burning spell on me .
it &apos;s not so mary louise and nora couldn &apos;t touch me .
it &apos;s so stefan wouldn &apos;t .
be more obvious .
well , since you &apos;re so curious ,
please allow me to continue .
julian is going to kill me .
just compliment the whiteness of his teeth .
he &apos;ll forget all about it .
is something wrong ?
no . no .
it &apos;s just that i &apos;ve never ...
do you mind if i ...
it was his first time .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ve been someone &apos;s first ,
so you know what it &apos;s like
to have a completely unforgettable place
in someone else &apos;s mind .
of course .
that &apos;s what i thought .
ok . so ...
what &apos;s the plan ?
ok . fair trade .
one heretic in good condition
in return for the coffin housing elena .
no . i meant the plan where we try to capture
a powerful heretic who &apos;d prefer we were dead .
easy . b @-@ town stuns him with magic ,
you shoot him with vervain ,
i--kchk-- snap his neck .
yeah , but after we get him to siphon away my visions .
wait . what ?
well , the visions are magic .
he &apos;s a siphon . it &apos;s worth a shot , right ?
any other suggestions of how we can rid bonnie of this
mysterious pain she &apos;s in , ric ?
room service . free shrimp .
you folks have the wrong--holy !
damon salvatore .
you know me ?
of course i know you .
it &apos;s good to see you &apos;re well , old friend .
come here , man .
all right .
come in , come in . come on .
uh , you caught me in the middle of a 72 @-@ hour social gathering .
make yourself at home .
uh , friend , with the vervain gun ,
if you could holster that , i ...
sure would feel a lot more comfortable .
how do you know , damon ?
oh , he &apos;s lily &apos;s son ,
the hero soldier .
we--we met at a bar near gettysburg ,
july of 1863 . nothing ?
i go to a lot of bars .
right . right , right .
uh , well , your mom was going through a rough patch .
she could not move on until she knew her boys were ok ,
so she sent me out to find you .
my mother abandoned her family and ran for the hills .
she doesn &apos;t give a flying crap about me .
i sense hostility , and that &apos;s fine .
all emotions are--are valid and welcome here ,
but it &apos;s the truth .
she just wanted to know you were happy , damon .
she loved you .
hey , you guys . what can i get you ?
cocktail , joint ?
jenny ?
does my mom know you &apos;re here ?
no , no , no . keep the car on this side of the road .
valerie never told me about your romance .
well , valerie never told me that you were alive .
would it have mattered ?
is that a real question ?
she told me that you &apos;d forgotten all about me .
she said you had moved on .
that--that was the only way i was able to move on , as well .
my mother was practically ripped out of my arms
and sent to a tb ward .
you don &apos;t move on from that .
you find distractions .
come with me . i want to show you something .
this is romantic .
this is my mother &apos;s grave .
i come here every day to replace the flowers .
she &apos;s been dead for 6 years ,
but i &apos;m still trying to make up for my failure .
what do you mean by that ?
she had consumption .
one day , her coughing would not stop .
my father sent me to go buy some flowers
to make an herbal tonic .
i ran to town as fast as i could ,
but by the time i got home with the flowers ,
she had been taken to the sanatorium .
you never got to say good @-@ bye .
she died in the tb ward shortly after .
i always wonder what would have happened
if i had just been able to run a little faster .
the tonic would have helped her .
she could have lived .
were these the kind of flowers you were sent for ?
yes . cream--
cream violets .
the tonic would not have saved her .
that &apos;s very kind of you , but you cannot be certain .
but i am .
i worked in a sanatorium ,
caring for patients who are just like your mother .
cream violets have no medicinal properties .
it &apos;s an old wives &apos; tale .
you father sent you on a fool &apos;s errand .
you were only 10 . he ...
probably wanted you out of the house
to make it easier on himself .
no matter what , you couldn &apos;t have saved your mother .
her death is not your fault .
time to say good @-@ bye .
i expected you would visit here sooner or later .
sir , if you would just let me explain .
we are leaving for new york now .
i did not mean to disobey you .
it was not me who you disobeyed .
come with me now , and we will speak no more of it .
the carriage awaits .
when will i see you again ?
i will find my way back to you .
i promise .
so it &apos;s kind of like &quot; the notebook &quot;
except you two never reconnect
and he totally forgets about you .
julian was in a hurry to get to europe .
he convinced me to lie to lily ,
tell her that stefan was happy .
believe me , julian had a way of convincing anyone to do anything .
so why did lily send you here ?
she didn &apos;t send me here exactly .
she had a job , and i volunteered ,
and she has the family on a short leash back home
with this whole &quot; i took you in as orphans ,
so i know what &apos;s best for you &quot; vibe .
no , thank you . you know , you can get
a drink served to you in a fishbowl here .
the other day ,
i called a number on this card ,
and just like that , i had a girlfriend .
it &apos;s called an escort service .
but she really got who i am , you know ?
it was a beautiful human experience ,
and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve discovered here--freedom .
the bad trip inside that prison world
has ended , my friends ,
and i am breathing in what my soul was craving--
f @-@ r @-@ e @-@ e @-@ dom .
well , in the spirit of helping others with their freedom ,
i have a favor to ask you ,
you know , as a siphoner .
let me translate for you .
my friends were playing with some mystical tool
they didn &apos;t quite understand ,
and now bonnie &apos;s chasing her own white rabbit around the farm .
so you want me to , what ,
siphon her problems away ?
just think of it as one big magical toke .
i don &apos;t--i don &apos;t really like to mix mediums ,
if you know what i mean .
siphon the damn visions .
we won &apos;t tell lily that we saw you
avoiding whatever mission you were sent to do ,
and we &apos;ll call it a day .
ok then . come on .
ready ?
yeah .
okay .
where &apos;s the phoenix stone ?
how do you know about the phoenix stone ?
how do you know about the phoenix stone ?
what are you people up to ?
espirimus paratis .
good news . your visions are gone .
bad news-- so &apos;s oscar .
he took the stone .
uh , how is that possible when you destroyed it , ric ?
we need to find him right now .
did you know he still had it ?
aw , come on . i mean , y--i--
a littl--kind of .
ric , tell her what happened .
no . i &apos;m asking you .
i live with the guy .
guys know stuff .
you lied to me .
i didn &apos;t lie to you .
ric lied to you . i just kept my mouth shut .
wait . i &apos;m not gonna be stuck in the middle of this .
no , no . you sort this out .
i &apos;m gonna go find our bargaining chip .
so the visions , the lost time ,
the crippling headaches , they don &apos;t mean anything ,
doesn &apos;t matter to you ?
oh , of course , they matter ,
but bringing jo back matters more .
you don &apos;t even know what this stone does ,
if it will work .
i was dead , gone ,
and so were you , bonnie .
we came back . we got our second chance .
we were on the other side , ok ?
it doesn &apos;t exist anymore .
look . jo was the love of my life ,
and if there is even a 1 % chance that this could work ,
i need to take it , no matter how dangerous or insane it may be
because if i don &apos;t i &apos;m gonna spend the rest of my life
wishing i had stayed dead .
no , no . keep your eyes on the road .
make a left here .
it &apos;ll take us back into town .
is there anything else you &apos;d like to know ?
no . i mean , it doesn &apos;t matter .
obviously , it was all a lie , right ?
what do you mean ?
well , valerie was using me .
no . no . valerie wouldn &apos;t have hurt you
because that would have inadvertently hurt me , as well .
did it ever occur to you that maybe valerie
doesn &apos;t give a crap about you or anyone else ?
i don &apos;t believe that .
no ?
how about the part where she sent me a telegram
saying she was coming back ?
she what ?
she &apos;d been gone a few months .
i promised i would find my way back to you .
&quot; i long to be in your arms again . &quot;
she said she wanted to run away with me .
her telegram said to meet her friday at noon .
i showed up two hours early .
he waited and waited for me .
with every passing footstep , he would turn ,
expecting to see me .
i sat around all day like an idiot ,
past sundown , after nightfall ,
but she never showed up ,
so , yeah , i guess you could say i &apos;m wondering
what the hell the whole point was .
surely , you &apos;re not still angry with her .
it was 150 years ago .
eventually , he accepted that he &apos;d been abandoned
all over again ,
and then he walked home
under the cold and distant stars .
how could you do that to him ?
there was a change of plan .
i &apos;m done talking to you about this .
slipping away before sunrise
on the very day our ship leaves for england ?
let me pass . i &apos;m not going .
yes , you are .
because lily will not travel anywhere
without her precious little orphans ,
and it is imperative that i leave today .
do i frighten you ?
no .
because i can hear your heart beating faster ,
both of your hearts , in fact .
does stefan salvatore know that you are pregnant with his child ?
i lied .
i do remember you .
i was fighting for the south .
it &apos;s not exactly a time i like to reminisce about
in front of my friends .
yeah . you had the same opinion back then .
hated everything your side believed in .
you wanted to desert
but feared shaming your old man .
you compelled me to take sick leave .
the next day , my entire regiment was slaughtered in gettysburg .
you saved my life .
i couldn &apos;t compel you back then .
all i did was talk to you
from one human to another .
i told you to follow your heart .
now it &apos;s my turn to desert .
i don &apos;t want to be a part of lily &apos;s cavalry , ok ?
i--i don &apos;t want rules or--or a chain of command .
i just want to have fun .
you know what ?
a little extra piece of advice .
a lot of people want the phoenix stone .
mess with it , and you end up dead .
full disclosure ,
i don &apos;t care about the stone .
then why are you chasing me , man ?
let &apos;s just say i &apos;d like to cash you in
for something way better .
aerodux motus .
phasmatos mosinus pyros allum .
phasmatos mosinus pyros allum .
phasmatos mosinus pyros allum .
phasmatos mosinus pyros allum .
never lie to me again .
my besties are buds again .
let &apos;s go make a deal .
is valerie here ?
i heard her leave the house .
i guess torture makes her hungry .
forgive me for prying ,
but i heard your mother died this past spring .
i just spent the day reliving stefan &apos;s first time .
i really don &apos;t feel like talking about my dead mother
with my hostage taker , but thanks .
i was simply curious about one &apos;s ability to heal
after such a loss .
well , you must have had a mother .
i mean , even mussolini had a mother .
of course i had a mother .
then you know that love is different than
any other kind of love .
stefan wrote about you all the time .
you can read for yourself .
here .
he loved you .
he missed you .
nora , remove the barrier spell , please .
as of this moment , miss forbes is no longer a prisoner .
what , is this one of those mean girl tricks ?
no . it &apos;s a reward for stefan &apos;s honesty .
go before i change my mind .
i don &apos;t know what made your heart grow 4 sizes today ,
but thanks .
游乐场
in the prison world before we desiccated ,
i came here every day to think .
i can see that sometimes you still do , as well .
that &apos;s a comfort .
it &apos;s strange to be here with you .
finally able to tell you the truth .
please don &apos;t tell lily .
well , you have your reasons for staying here ,
and i have mine for leaving .
whatever will we do .
julian solved his dilemma by beating me senseless
till i was left near dead
and the other heartbeat inside me stopped .
when i regained consciousness ,
i was on the ship to england .
lily said julian had found me robbed
and beaten on the street .
she believed him of course ,
and she healed me with her blood .
julian knew i could never tell lily what he had done
because that would also have exposed my lies .
thank you .
she never would have forgiven me
for having an affair with her son .
i didn &apos;t want to live under julian &apos;s thumb ,
so that night as we crossed the atlantic ,
i drew myself a bath , laced my tea with laudanum ,
and went quietly to sleep ...
but i died with lily &apos;s blood in my system ...
and by virtue of pure happenstance ,
i became the first heretic .
you don &apos;t know how sorry i am ...
about everything .
maybe you never will .
so what does a rock that makes you see
screaming people have to do with reincarnation ?
i don &apos;t know , but i &apos;ve read that book already
cover to cover , and it &apos;s a waste of time .
in fact , all of these are a waste of time .
they talk about resurrection ,
the phoenix rising from the ashes ,
but nothing about a stone that
brings people back from the dead .
are you sure you understand what you &apos;re trying to do ?
it &apos;s not like jo &apos;s spirit is behind a veil
that we lift and she magically appears .
this is necromancy .
i &apos;m gonna show you something .
the hospital can only preserve the body for a set amount of time .
i &apos;ve been paying off the tech to fake the logs .
jo is still in there .
she has to be .
ric .
i know what i &apos;m getting myself into .
i--i just can &apos;t do it alone .
at least tell me you &apos;ll try .
i &apos;ll try .
damon .
you should have come yourself .
it &apos;s been a long day .
i have little energy for your riddles .
gettysburg , 1863 .
you sent oscar to check on me .
if that had been you , it would have changed
the entire course of my life .
i was supposed to be dead .
and i was supposed to be your son .
how do you know this ?
your prodigal heretic was fear @-@ and @-@ loathing
in the armpit of myrtle beach .
oscar .
don &apos;t worry , mommy .
he &apos;s in the middle of a vervain detox .
give me elena . maybe i won &apos;t kill him .
you will not lay a hand on another member of my family .
you know , this whole family thing
really irked me at first ...
but now i get it .
you loved me , time passed ,
and you moved on to a new family .
so did i.
why don &apos;t we end this mutual disdain once and for all ?
give me elena , you get your son back .
caroline !
how did you escape ?
i didn &apos;t . lily let me go .
she did ?
yeah .
i guess today is just full of valerie @-@ sized surprises , huh ?
look . i was just a kid when i met her ,
just a troubled boy mourning his dead mom .
i was young and human .
i was young and human when you and i met ,
and i remember the exact moment when i first saw you .
and do you remember the first time that you ever saw me ?
i &apos;m sorry . that was totally unfair .
just please forget i asked .
i mean , you were even sitting next to elena ,
so of course you only had eyes for her .
things have changed .
different circumstances , different results .
here &apos;s a different circumstance .
valerie &apos;s out of the prison world .
does that change anything for you ?
of course not .
you don &apos;t wonder what would have happened
if valerie would have shown up to meet you .
i don &apos;t wonder anymore .
i don &apos;t care about the past .
all i care is that you &apos;re here and you &apos;re safe .
you &apos;re with me .
i know .
you &apos;re awake .
awake and ...
coming down hard .
where the hell am i ?
a college town near mystic falls .
did lily send you ?
lily has no idea where you are .
i used a locator spell .
maybe i can turn this thing around
before she gets in the loop .
so have you done your duty to the family
and found julian yet ?
can you keep a secret ?
you have no idea .
i found him months ago .
and you didn &apos;t tell lily ?
i didn &apos;t tell anyone .
i wanted to ...
live a little before i came back .
and now that you &apos;re back ?
i don &apos;t know , val .
i haven &apos;t exactly thought it through from my hostage bed here .
i know you , oscar .
eventually , you &apos;ll leverage julian &apos;s location
for your freedom from lily .
yeah . that &apos;s a-- that &apos;s a pretty good idea .
yeah . yeah . i &apos;ll probably do that .
you have a sweet soul , oscar ,
and you &apos;ve been good to me ,
like a brother .
but julian is the devil .
i can &apos;t let lily bring him back .
