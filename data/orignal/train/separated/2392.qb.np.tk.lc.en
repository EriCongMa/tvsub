mystic falls ... i was born here .
this is my home .
and mine .
and mine .
for centuries , supernatural creatures have lived among us .
they were vampires , werewolves , doppelgangers ...
witches .
and even hybrids .
there are those who protect them .
what &apos;s going on ?
we just need to ask you a few questions about your son .
you have no idea what you &apos;re up against .
and those who want them dead .
friends , we are the beginning .
the ones we love .
and the ones we &apos;ve lost .
this magic is dark .
you made your choice .
now they &apos;re taking it out on me .
i &apos;m sorry , grams ! no , no !
then there &apos;s elena . she &apos;s one of us now .
a vampire .
and i &apos;ll do anything to help her survive it .
you &apos;re making a big mistake .
no , i &apos;m not .
if i can get elena used to animal blood right out the gate ...
you &apos;re reaching .
maybe she &apos;ll be able to bypass all the things that we went through .
delusional .
maybe she actually has a shot at this .
wrong . you &apos;re just wrong , stefan .
she won &apos;t be able to handle it
if she hurts someone , damon .
her compassion is her achilles &apos; heel
and everything is magnified right now .
then you better hope she &apos;s not a fan of bambi .
close your eyes .
she needs human blood , stefan .
from the vein .
oh , come on , you know what happens .
you name me a vampire who didn &apos;t kill at least one person when they were new .
you name me one who went on the bunny diet and didn &apos;t kill dozens .
if she kills someone , she will crumble .
how much pain do you think she can take
before she shuts off her humanity switch ?
it happens to the best of us at least once .
we get over it , stefan .
a hundred years or so .
yeah , well , i think i &apos;d like her to skip that part .
she can &apos;t learn to control the blood lust
if she &apos;s never actually experienced the blood lust .
what are you doing ? knock it off .
it &apos;s a cheat .
like giving a kid a calculator before they know math .
i said stop .
don &apos;t worry , he &apos;ll heal .
bigger animals are more resilient .
you did it .
i know it &apos;s hard .
but you can do this .
what &apos;s going on ?
oh , we &apos;re just having a little disagreement about process , right ?
you &apos;re still not on board with the animal plan .
nope . i say rip off the proverbial band @-@ aid and let it bleed .
you &apos;re a vampire , elena . be a vampire .
you ready to go ?
vampires eat people .
it &apos;s part of the natural food pyramid .
trust me .
you &apos;re going to be miserable .
i can &apos;t do it .
all right , it &apos;s like the starting line of a race , right ?
so you just push off with every ounce of strength that you have , ok ?
yeah . i was a cheerleader . i sucked at track .
just concentrate , ok ?
you can do it .
i can &apos;t .
all i can think about is your hands on my body .
ok .
no , no , no , i didn &apos;t--
i didn &apos;t say take them off .
it feels good .
yeah ?
mm @-@ hmm .
what does it feel like ?
it feels like you &apos;re touching every nerve on my body .
everything is heightened .
taste .
the smell .
sight . touch .
this seat &apos;s taken .
&quot; faulty gas line leads to tragic explosion at young farm . &quot;
really ?
better than &quot; town council blown up ,
police have no suspects . &quot;
unless the perpetrator &apos;s right next to me .
well , don &apos;t look at me . i always take credit for killing people .
seriously , stop looking at me like that , liz .
if i was going to kill ten people , i wouldn &apos;t blow &apos; em up .
i &apos;d have a dinner party .
the explosion was sparked from inside . this wasn &apos;t an accident .
you say that like it &apos;s a bad thing .
the council &apos;s dead , liz . i see that as a win .
i &apos;ve known some of the council since i was a kid .
they were my friends .
your friends tried to kill your daughter .
who &apos;s the new guy ?
excuse me , sheriff . hi .
i was wondering if i could speak to you for a minute .
it &apos;s about the explosion at the young farm .
i &apos;m sorry , mister ...
connor jordan .
are you with the insurance investigators ?
no , no , i &apos;m more of an independent contractor .
can we speak in private ?
sure .
thanks .
nice to meet you , too ,
mr. busybody guy .
so what are these again ?
they &apos;re paper lanterns .
student council made them for after the memorial .
you light them up in honor of all the dead .
nobody thought fire might be a little inappropriate ?
yeah , i wouldn &apos;t make that crack in front of elena .
how is she ?
i guess she &apos;s fine ... considering .
if there &apos;s anything i can do , you know ,
short of giving her a ride , you &apos;ll let me know , right ?
i &apos;m only alive because she told stefan to save me first .
she &apos;s a vampire because of me ,
so i &apos;d like to pay it back or forward or whatever .
yeah .
jeremy ?
picture an emo pixie cut and braces .
april ?
yeah .
oh , you look great .
do you remember april ? elena used to--
elena used to baby @-@ sit you , yeah , i remember .
yeah , before i got shipped off to boarding school by my dad .
your dad . oh , my god ,
i am so sorry about your dad .
thank you .
i guess . i sort of don &apos;t know how to answer
when people say that .
your dad was pastor young , right ?
he of the faulty gas line .
sorry . i haven &apos;t figured out
what to say about that yet , either .
wow , i am being a freak .
i &apos;m just , you know ,
not much for grief , i guess .
i have to go register ... or something .
i think .
hey , care , it &apos;s me .
i &apos;m back . i , um ...
can you call me ? i &apos;ve been having some ...
adjustment issues .
well , what &apos;s that for ?
this is from the year you were born .
i think we should celebrate .
celebrate what ?
your first feed .
i know it was disgusting
and traumatic and it was horrible .
but you did it anyway .
you survived it .
well , um ...
i wouldn &apos;t say i survived it .
it actually kind of made me sick .
listen , i choked it down for a month
before i could stomach the taste .
it gets easier .
this , on the other hand ,
will go down like silk .
you &apos;re so cheery .
yeah , because you &apos;re here .
you &apos;re ... alive . ish .
and , uh , you &apos;re going--
you &apos;re going to get through this .
so , would you like to do the honors ?
ok .
oh , my god .
cheers .
ah , perfect timing , damon .
yeah , we just got back .
what ?
did you do it ?
that seat &apos;s taken .
but there &apos;s no one here .
i &apos;m&apos;st going to pretend like there &apos;s someone there .
because the alternative &apos;s just too damn depressing .
did you set off the explosion that killed the town council ?
am i wearing my &quot; i blew up the council &quot; t @-@ shirt ?
why does everybody keep asking me that ?
did you ?
no .
anything else ?
yes .
something &apos;s wrong .
i can &apos;t keep any of the animal blood down .
well , there &apos;s a shock .
i think i need your help .
of course you do .
pick your meal .
you got asian fusion , mexican .
what about some good old american comfort food ?
no .
no human blood . stefan &apos;s right .
i have to at least try to get through this
without hurting anyone .
fine . come on .
what are you doing ?
giving you what you need . drink .
what ? !
you &apos;re a new vampire , elena .
you need warm blood from the vein .
maybe this will do the trick .
why not ? but just don &apos;t tell stefan .
why not ?
because blood sharing is kind of ... personal .
what do you mean , it &apos;s personal ?
just drink !
this is wrong .
a bunch of people died and we &apos;re having sex .
grief sex . it &apos;s healthy .
it &apos;s selfish .
it &apos;s natural .
besides , if we stopped having sex every time somebody died in this town ,
we &apos;d explode .
we need to be more sensitive .
tyler .
oh , come on .
i love you .
how &apos;s that for sensitive ?
i love you , too .
who the hell is that ?
may i help you ?
good evening .
i &apos;m hoping i can help you , actually .
i spoke with sheriff forbes earlier .
my name is connor jordan .
carol lockwood .
i know who you are , connor .
and i believe the sheriff made it clear
that the tragedy at the farm house was an internal matter .
that &apos;s one way of looking at it , i guess .
although i prefer the term &quot; cover @-@ up . &quot;
do you mind if i come in ?
you know , i really don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea .
excuse me !
thank you .
you &apos;re aware that it wasn &apos;t an accident .
any rookie fireman could tell you that .
what are you , the press ?
not exactly .
so 12 council members are dead .
you &apos;re the mayor . why weren &apos;t you at that meeting ?
it wasn &apos;t official town business .
what was it , then ?
mom ?
what &apos;s going on ?
is there something i can help you with ?
maybe . how you doing ? i &apos;m connor .
tyler ! oh , my god !
tyler , run !
please tell me that &apos;s the last one .
these were specially carved .
the length , the width .
if you were a normal vampire , you would be dead .
this guy knew what he was doing .
his gloves must have been steeped in vervain .
he was looking for a vampire
and he didn &apos;t hesitate for a second when he found one .
these etchings ...
are the bullets spelled ?
i don &apos;t know .
they &apos;re something .
how are you feeling ?
you look a little , uh , strung out .
i &apos;m fine .
it &apos;s just my emotions are all over the place .
everything &apos;s heightened .
i mean , just the sight of all the names of the dead
makes me want to cry for a week .
you didn &apos;t have to volunteer .
people died .
people we &apos;ve known our whole lives . so ...
yeah , i did .
is that ...
april young , yeah .
hey there .
hey .
long time , no see .
not since ...
my parents &apos; funeral .
yeah .
are you going to survive this ?
they want me to speak .
i guess all the kids who lost somebody can .
what am i supposed to say ?
&quot; i &apos;m sorry my dad didn &apos;t fix the gas line . &quot;
but if i don &apos;t say anything , then ...
i mean , what if nobody does ?
i mean , my dad and i didn &apos;t always get along or anything ,
but everybody still deserves to have nice things
said about them at their own funeral , you know ?
i mean , for my mom &apos;s funeral ,
everybody said some really nice things . i ...
you say what you want to say .
or you don &apos;t say anything at all .
and don &apos;t worry about your dad .
everyone in this town loved him .
yeah .
until 2 days ago .
even still .
i &apos;m sorry , i ...
i have to go .
bonnie ?
bonnie , i know you &apos;re in there .
i can hear you breathing .
bonnie , please , it &apos;s important .
are you all right ?
can i come in , please ?
my grams , it was like she was dying all over again .
just because i didn &apos;t listen to her about not doing black magic .
well , you &apos;re dealing with the other side .
it &apos;s not reliable .
witches were probably just messing with your head ,
trying to teach you a lesson .
well , it worked .
i tried to do a basic nature spell this morning
just to clear my head , and ...
it just brought it all back .
like it was happening all over again .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m a mess .
i &apos;ve been holed up in here , avoiding everyone .
i &apos;ve completely blown off jamie .
you came here &apos; cause you needed something , right ?
yeah . but it can wait .
oh , come on , stefan , i &apos;m ok . come on .
you &apos;re not exactly a drop by kind of guy .
if something &apos;s wrong , tell me .
all right .
these burn to the touch .
could just be steeped in vervain ,
but this writing--have you ever seen anything like this before ?
no , it &apos;s not magical writing ,
if that &apos;s what you &apos;re thinking .
where &apos;d you get these ?
i think we have a new vampire hunter in town .
hmm . that &apos;s bad timing .
i &apos;m here , i &apos;m here .
where are you ?
i &apos;m in the basement bathroom .
is that you at the door ?
not yet .
i &apos;m sorry , there &apos;s someone in here .
damon , hurry .
oh , you again .
stalking small town funerals ?
oh , damon .
thank god .
sorry , i spilled coffee all over my dress .
we have not met . i &apos;m connor jordan .
damon germaphobe .
everything ok in there ?
yeah , just a minute !
so what brings you to mystic falls ?
bible salesman ?
no , no , actually i &apos;m in , uh ,
environmental clean @-@ up .
heard you had a bit of a pollution problem .
huh . well , i was unaware .
hmm . i breathe pretty easy .
i &apos;m so sorry that took so long .
no problem .
well , enjoy your stay .
we love visitors , and the scenery is to die for .
funeral parlor . too soon .
sorry .
sorry , you scared me .
i was just practicing my speech for later .
did you bring the blood bag ?
do you want to say that a little louder ?
elena !
no , i can &apos;t .
it tastes like ...
what &apos;s wrong with me ?
i don &apos;t know .
maybe it &apos;s your doppelganger blood ,
you &apos;re rejecting the transition .
i &apos;m dying , aren &apos;t i ?
no , you &apos;re not dying .
you just need to drink from the vein .
no . no , no . i can &apos;t risk killing anyone , damon .
maybe i &apos;m better off dead .
don &apos;t even think like that , elena .
you &apos;ll be fine .
ok ?
i have to get back inside .
oh , great .
what &apos;s in the bag , damon ?
mid @-@ service snack . church always gets me hungry .
the whole blood of christ thing , you know .
i brought it for elena .
you &apos;re really that intent on having your way ?
it &apos;s not my way , it &apos;s the only way .
if she hurts someone ,
she &apos;ll be desperate to turn the guilt off .
maybe even desperate enough to shut off her humanity .
what , and become a ripper ?
we can &apos;t let her be anything like me .
or god forbid she &apos;s anything like me .
that &apos;s really what you &apos;re thinking .
she &apos;s going to go off the rails
eventually anyway , stefan .
so the faster we can make it happen ,
the sooner we can get her back on track .
she &apos;s strong . if we help her , she can survive .
she &apos;s starving , stefan .
she hasn &apos;t been able to keep blood down for days .
what are you talking about ? she told me she was fine .
well , she lied . your four @-@ legged protein shake was a bust .
the juice box was a no @-@ go .
she can &apos;t even keep my blood down .
she drank from you ?
oops . did i say that out loud ?
are you ok ?
hey , april was looking for you .
she wanted help with her speech .
oh . where is she ?
i don &apos;t know .
what are you doing here , tyler ?
being sensitive to the community &apos;s loss .
hmm . with a hunter out to get you ?
i &apos;m not letting a hunter stop me from where i &apos;m supposed to be .
also , if he shows his face , i &apos;m going to kick his ass .
before we begin the mass ,
we &apos;d like to open the floor to anyone
who would like to share a memory
about our late friends on the town council .
i know that april young wanted to say a few words about her dad .
april ?
april ? are you still here , honey ?
is there anyone else who would like to
share a recollection or a memory about pastor young ?
come on up , elena .
don &apos;t know why that always makes me smile .
she doesn &apos;t look so good .
maybe you should have told me she was rejecting all food sources .
jealousy &apos;s beneath you , brother .
oh , bite me .
i , um ,
when i talked to april earlier ,
she was kind of nervous about coming up to speak , and ...
now that i &apos;m up here , i &apos;m kind of nervous , too .
the worst day of loving someone is the day that you lose them .
do you smell that ?
blood .
nobody move . don &apos;t turn around . it &apos;s a trap .
i , um ...
it &apos;s ok . it &apos;s ok .
i got you , i got you .
please turn to page 42 in your hymn book .
let us join together in song .
the blood . stefan , the blood , i can smell it .
there &apos;s so much .
it &apos;s all right , just remember what we talked about .
focus , push back . come on , you can do this .
what &apos;s wrong with her ?
she &apos;s hungry . she hasn &apos;t fed .
so get her out of here .
we can &apos;t .
there &apos;s somebody watching us .
i &apos;m going to go rip his head off now .
you do that , damon , and you risk exposing all of us .
well , i think the risk will be slightly diminished
when i , you know , rip his head off .
stefan , i &apos;m losing it .
you have 10 seconds before i go old @-@ fashioned on the new guy .
don &apos;t do it , damon , please .
3 , 2 , 1 , bye .
wait , wait , wait , elena . feed from me .
it &apos;s ok .
everyone will just think you &apos;re upset . feed from me .
it &apos;s ok . you &apos;re ok .
i &apos;m here .
thank you .
i &apos;m ok .
but the blood , i can still smell it .
it &apos;s got to be april . we have to help her .
elena , we can &apos;t risk it .
then i &apos;m going to do it .
excuse me .
i just wanted to say a few words about pastor young .
what do we do ?
back in first grade ,
i was a brat who couldn &apos;t be bothered with team sports .
didn &apos;t care much about anything that didn &apos;t affect me .
but he was the one who made me understand
how important it is to be part of a team , a community ,
of giving yourself up for the sake of--
oh , my god !
i &apos;m going to kill that bastard .
damon &apos;s way ahead of you .
stay here , i have to help him .
what about april ?
i got it , go .
i have to call an ambulance .
no , he &apos;s fine !
the whole town just watched you get shot .
i &apos;m calling an ambulance .
elena ?
damon !
what the hell was that for ?
you know what .
april !
she &apos;s not dead , but if you feed on her , you will kill her !
let go of me !
look at her ! look at her ,
elena . it &apos;s april . april young .
she &apos;s not a warm body for you to feed on . she &apos;s your friend .
she &apos;s an orphan , just like you .
and she &apos;s scared ... just like you were .
please ! don &apos;t hurt me , please !
no one &apos;s going to hurt you .
no one &apos;s going to hurt you .
she needs you .
you can make her forget all of this .
why did he do this ?
no , i--i can &apos;t , caroline , you have to do it .
no , the only way you &apos;re going to learn is if you do it yourself .
no , i can &apos;t--
yes , you can .
you just need to believe what you &apos;re telling her .
april , listen to me .
everything &apos;s going to be ok .
you &apos;re going to get through this , just like i got through it .
and i &apos;m going to help you . i promise .
i &apos;m going to be ok .
you &apos;re going to help me .
you watched the funeral from up here
so that you could grieve alone .
it was a beautiful service .
people said really nice things .
that was insane .
how do you think they &apos;ll cover this one up ?
an assassination attempt on the mayor &apos;s son .
altar boy goes postal .
what happened there ?
girlfriend went a little overboard .
nice ink .
what ink ?
you didn &apos;t see his tattoo ? it was huge .
he didn &apos;t have a tattoo .
yeah , he did .
&quot; dear april ,
i &apos;m sorry for what you &apos;re going through .
what i did was a necessary sacrifice ,
and i &apos;m afraid it &apos;s only the first of many more sacrifices to come .
there &apos;s always been an evil that spread through mystic falls ,
but now a greater one is coming .
my death is but the first in the war ahead .
i will see you again when we all find our salvation .
until then , i love you . dad . &quot;
helps with the cravings .
you &apos;re mad .
yeah , i &apos;m mad . you lied to me .
i didn &apos;t lie , i just didn &apos;t tell you--
come on , elena , you lied to me .
you were just so happy that things were going well , and--
you think i &apos;m happy ?
i just didn &apos;t want to ruin it for you .
you &apos;re in hell ,
which means that i &apos;m in hell .
and then you go to damon for help .
yeah , because i thought that he would understand .
you think i don &apos;t ?
stefan , please ...
you fed on him , elena . you fed on him .
i know that may not mean much to you ,
but it means a lot to me .
and i know it certainly meant a lot to damon .
i didn &apos;t want to hurt you .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry .
look , i &apos;m really , really sorry , i ...
why am i crying ?
i am so sick of crying .
your emotions are a bit heightened right now .
i feel like i &apos;ve been crying since the day that my parents died .
my life is ... it &apos;s like a never ending funeral .
we keep burying people , stefan .
you want to know what &apos;s heightened ?
it &apos;s grief . i can &apos;t stop feeling everyone &apos;s grief .
all the hurt , i feel like it &apos;s trying to explode out of me .
come on .
come with me .
where ?
something we need to do .
what are we doing here ?
i don &apos;t know .
ask stefan .
stefan . what are we doing ?
we &apos;re finishing the memorial we didn &apos;t get to have earlier .
we need to start healing , damon .
we &apos;ve all lost so much , especially recently .
i think we &apos;re numb to it .
we push it away , we make a joke out of it ,
ignore how we feel .
time to just let ourselves grieve .
so you &apos;re lighting lanterns .
yeah , yeah . we need to do this .
what we need to do is find out who this hunter is
and what he knows about the death of the council .
we have more important things to be doing right now than this .
not tonight , we don &apos;t .
this is for my uncle zach .
my friend lexi .
for alaric .
this is for vickie .
this is for my dad .
and tyler &apos;s .
this is for our parents , for vickie ...
anna , jenna .
and alaric .
no way . i &apos;m not doing that .
this is for my grams .
this , um ...
is for my mom ,
my dad , and ... jenna .
everyone that we &apos;ve all lost ;
everyone that this town has lost .
and for me .
i guess .
they &apos;re floating lanterns in the sky .
can you believe that ?
japanese lantern is a symbol of letting go of the past .
well , here &apos;s a newsflash--
we &apos;re not japanese .
you know what they are ?
children .
like lighting a candle &apos;s going to make everything ok .
or even saying a prayer ,
or pretending elena is not going to end up
just like the rest of us murderous vampires .
stupid , delusional ,
exasperating little children .
i know what you &apos;re going to say .
it makes them feel better , damon . so what ?
for how long ? a minute ? a day ?
what difference does it make ?
because in the end ,
when you lose somebody ,
every candle , every prayer
is not going to make up for the fact
that the only thing that you have left
is a hole in your life
where that somebody that you cared about used to be .
and a rock .
with a birthday carved into it that i &apos;m pretty sure is wrong .
so , thanks , friend .
thanks for leaving me here to baby @-@ sit .
because i should be long gone by now .
i didn &apos;t get the girl . remember ?
i &apos;m just stuck here fighting with my brother
and taking care of the kids .
you owe me big .
