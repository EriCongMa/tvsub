第五季 第二十二集
i paid you to help me with this adoption .
i , um ...
would you like to take a minute ?
no , i &apos;m fine .
i told you that it was tricky because ...
the baby was half chippewa indian
and tribal law might apply , but you didn &apos;t care .
that &apos;s why we &apos;re suing you for $ 6 million .
any more questions ?
mrs. gopnik ,
who , specifically , did you hire to help you with this adoption ?
which firm ?
lockhart / gardner .
and , in fact , wasn &apos;t it lockhart / gardner
who failed you ? not ... objection , it &apos;s already been established
mrs. florrick was the lead attorney on this adoption .
no , that has not been established .
david lee was the lead attorney .
oh , come on , alicia , you know very well ...
it is unconscionable that you are blaming this on me .
one at a time when speaking .
excuse me , ladies and gentlemen , we can &apos;t hear everybody .
the teleconferencing system can &apos;t handle that much crosstalk .
we need to move on . any questions from lockhart / gardner ?
they &apos;re not after us ,
they &apos;re after the deeper pockets of lockhart / gardner .
i know , we just need to get david lee talking .
... on a day @-@ to @-@ day basis with this adoption ?
who ?
alicia .
alicia florrick ? when she worked at our firm ?
yes .
was this under the direction of david lee ?
mr. schmidt , you &apos;ll be allowed follow @-@ up questions afterwards .
thank you , mr. lee .
and who told you that the adoption had fallen through ?
alicia .
so , alicia was in charge of the day @-@ to @-@ day ,
but for some reason you are suing both lockhart / gardner
and florrick @-@ agos for $ 6 million ?
is there a question there , diane ?
well , i thought that was a question .
if you &apos;re asking whether we &apos;re suing both of your firms ,
the answer is yes .
unfortunately , we have to leave it there .
i suggest we resume in three hours
when i land in chicago .
at which point i &apos;ll be able to question mrs. florrick .
can &apos;t wait .
okay , we &apos;ll resume the teleconference at 1 : 00p.m.
lockhart / gardner / canning .
the vote ?
that &apos;s my bet .
are you ready for questioning ?
i &apos;ll be fine .
yeah , we should prep .
canning seemed a bit too eager for my taste .
i have to pick up dinner for tonight ,
i &apos;ll be back in an hour .
your son &apos;s graduation ?
yup .
we &apos;re having a dinner party .
how are you handling it ?
handling ?
empty nest .
my mom , she ...
she almost broke down when i left .
thanks , cary .
yeah .
eli , what &apos;s up ?
disaster . i &apos;ll be there in two minutes .
wait , uh ... you ... you &apos;ll be where in two minutes ?
your office . i &apos;m coming to you .
no , eli , i &apos;m heading out .
well , you can &apos;t , finn &apos;s already on his way .
i have an hour . i have to pick something up .
finn is pulling out of the race .
what ?
castro dropped a bombshell .
you need to talk to him , he doesn &apos;t like me .
well , i can &apos;t convince him if he doesn &apos;t want to run .
no , he wants to . we have to convince him not to .
eli ?
this bombshell will hurt finn ,
it will hurt peter .
i &apos;m five minutes away , i &apos;m coming to you .
oh , come on .
who did this ?
hi , mom . where are you ?
bloomingdale &apos;s .
what kind of sunglasses does zach like ?
uh , mom , i have to ask you a favor .
can you pick up the lasagna and the cake for tonight ?
why is zach leaving tomorrow ?
mom , did you hear my question ?
yes . why is zach leaving tomorrow ?
because he has a summer job at georgetown .
it &apos;s at fig catering on blue island avenue .
thought you were heading off .
why doesn &apos;t he just take the summer off ?
go to india or something .
mom ,
if you don &apos;t want to pick up the food ,
can you just tell me that ,
so i can try and find someone else ?
i can pick up the food .
why don &apos;t i make it ?
what ? oh , no .
yes .
i can make a lasagna as good as any caterer .
uh , i need to keep things simple tonight ,
&apos;cause i &apos;m gonna be here all day .
why is it not simple if i make it ?
come on , let me make the food .
i &apos;m hanging up now .
mom , please .
what is this , some kind of empty nest thing ?
is that why you &apos;re so tense ?
i &apos;m not tense .
good .
i &apos;ll make the food , i &apos;ll see you tonight .
i ... oh .
howard lyman .
no .
yes .
he &apos;s undecided ? the only undecided .
that &apos;s so my luck this year .
listen , just offer him something .
he &apos;s easily persuadable .
we &apos;re like a banana republic here .
and i would hurry .
diane is not will , you know that .
oh , that &apos;s true .
diane needed will to run this firm well .
they were like yin and yang .
left brain , right .
we need a strong managing partner .
what about me ?
oh , howard , you don &apos;t want to do that .
it &apos;s , uh , too much of a hassle .
besides , you &apos;re too valued as a senior partner .
let canning be the front man .
you &apos;ll be the ... shadow behind the scenes .
like a puppet master .
yes .
we need you to vote for canning
at the partnership meeting tomorrow .
uh , i &apos;ll propose a change in management ,
and you second it . we have the votes .
what do i get ?
you &apos;ve been wanting a @-@ an office near the bathrooms ,
we could do that . and @-@ and ...
you can have the biggest one there .
you &apos;re currently napping in your office . this office ...
what are you doing ?
what am i doing ?
yes . what is that ?
that &apos;s lockhart / gardner .
they &apos;re trying to bribe howard lyman
into voting diane out as managing partner .
you can &apos;t be watching that .
what ? yes , i can .
no , you can &apos;t . turn it off .
no , clarke , they left their camera on .
they thought they turned it off
when they turned the monitor off .
i &apos;m just passively watching .
no .
funny , you don &apos;t seem passive .
your camera &apos;s on , mr. canning .
they can &apos;t hear you , we are muted .
stop it . this is ridiculous .
let go of it .
no , you let go !
you &apos;re acting childish .
oh , i &apos;m acting childish .
yes , you are ,
you &apos;re gonna break it ...
hey , guys , guys .
i &apos;m trying to have a meeting here .
maybe next time get some doors on your conference room .
how did you get this ?
i have someone in castro &apos;s office .
he won &apos;t use it now ,
he &apos;ll wait until peter &apos;s overcommitted ,
or we start spending money on commercials .
so we put it out first .
no .
well , then how do we fight it ?
we don &apos;t . that &apos;s a criminal offense .
well , that &apos;s debatable .
alicia , it is not debatable .
you bribed a prosecutor
to drop drug charges against your sister .
i didn &apos;t bribe the prose ...
oh , you cut a deal to lessen charges on another case .
that &apos;s a bribe .
you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing .
i do .
you don &apos;t realize the ramifications ...
you don &apos;t . you &apos;re gonna break this thing .
it &apos;s expensive .
guys , come on . cary .
stop ! stop it !
stop it .
what &apos;s going on , eli ?
nothing &apos;s going on .
peter is withdrawing his support .
oh , come on . he &apos;s endorsed candidates with worse problems .
at least this is sympathetic .
a bribe is not sympathetic .
she was gonna be eaten alive by the system .
she needed time to get back on her feet , and both my parents
were at the end of their tether .
peter &apos;s moving on .
we advise you to withdraw to avoid an embarrassment .
eli ,
is this about the photo ?
the photo of finn leaving my apartment .
alicia , you like finn . good for you .
he seems like a good person , but put your political hat on .
this is not survivable .
finn &apos;s heroism will be forgotten in three months &apos; time
and all we &apos;ll be left with is
peter endorsing a briber .
oh , here he is . peter .
no , it &apos;s jackie .
hello , alicia .
um , why did you think peter ?
jackie , can i call you back in a minute ?
oh , god , what does she want ?
oh , no , it &apos;s okay . i just want to know what cake you want .
um ... uh , what ?
what kind of cake you want me to make-- uh , meringue ,
devil &apos;s food ... jackie , what ...
i @-@ i don &apos;t need you to make a cake .
are you sure ? veronica called
and said you wanted me to bake a cake
for zach tonight .
no ,
i asked her to pick up the cake .
it &apos;s too hot .
i don &apos;t mind making it .
alicia .
wha ... where are you going ?
uh , no , i &apos;m right here .
jackie , hold on a sec . what are you gonna do ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m too angry .
okay , well , don &apos;t withdraw .
let &apos;s talk .
sorry .
alicia , it &apos;s time @-@ sensitive .
okay . we &apos;ll talk later , okay ?
yeah .
jackie , thanks for the offer , but i &apos;m gonna ...
jackie ?
you can rationalize it any way you want ,
but it would still ...
i &apos;m not rationalizing anything . whatever we do ,
it &apos;s a partner &apos;s decision . you &apos;re not a partner .
hey , hey , hey , one second . all right ...
diane is great , but she &apos;s still struggling .
we don &apos;t want her gone ,
we just want to ... nudge her aside .
that they left their camera on ?
yes .
and they can &apos;t see us ?
no .
and we &apos;re trying to figure out what to do .
we know what to do . we have to turn it off .
no , it &apos;s not our mistake .
it &apos;s their mistake . we have to zealously represent our client .
not by cheating .
it &apos;s not cheating . according to the aba ...
it &apos;s an inadvertent disclosure .
it &apos;s like if someone accidentally sent you their @-@ their courtroom strategy .
exactly . you have to return it .
no , you don &apos;t . you have to zealously represent your client by using it .
people think by adding &quot; zealously &quot; to everything ,
it makes it all right .
&quot; a lawyer who receives documents not intended for them
should refrain from examining the documents
and notify the sending lawyer . &quot;
that is the equivalent of a document .
those are the 1992 rules . the new rules do not say
that the lawyer must refrain from using the information .
where are you reading that ?
follow the link . the new rules leave it up to the lawyers .
no . the aba says the lawyer must consult with the client .
you &apos;re the one being sued for $ 6 million , alicia .
so do we leave it on or turn it off ?
okay , then .
we &apos;re counting on you . thank you .
well , they &apos;re not talking about trial strategy ,
they &apos;re talking about moving diane out .
has nothing to do with us .
so we turn it off ?
yes .
oh ... this is such a mistake .
we can &apos;t turn their side off ,
we can only tell them they left it on .
wait .
they &apos;ll think we were listening .
we were listening .
is that a good thing or a bad thing ?
mr. canning ? david lee ?
you left your camera on .
think he &apos;ll stick with us ?
who knows ?
howard can &apos;t remember what he ate this morning .
must be muted on their end . ... florrick @-@ agos .
we need to call them .
then we can handle florrick @-@ agos next .
did you talk to her ?
the wife ? yeah , i spoke to her after the deposition .
she believes you ?
yeah .
we just agreed that we can &apos;t do this .
clarke .
and they have no idea ?
no , florrick @-@ agos ? none .
uh , i think she feels betrayed by them .
you got to make nice with her , though .
mrs. gopnik ?
i know , she likes me .
and we just blame it on alicia .
and florrick @-@ agos is done .
done and gone in 48 hours .
diane &apos;s gonna want to save alicia , you know ?
well , we &apos;ll get chumhum , we &apos;ll take paisley ,
and then we &apos;ll decide what to do with her .
that doesn &apos;t change anything .
we have to tell them it &apos;s on .
they just said they &apos;re gonna destroy us in 48 hours .
that changes everything .
well , we were listening , so now we have to ...
now we have to decipher ...
so now we &apos;re all overreacting .
what it was that they ...
thank you .
what did they say , exactly ?
they said they talked to mrs. gopnik .
no , they said they talked to the wife .
i heard &quot; waif . &quot;
&quot; waif &quot; ? what does that even mean ?
i don &apos;t know .
no . canning said he talked to the wife after the deposition .
and that florrick @-@ agos would collapse in 48 hours .
and that mrs. gopnik feels betrayed by us .
why ?
i don &apos;t know .
but it sounds like they &apos;re lying to her .
remember ? david lee said , &quot; did she believe you ? &quot;
it makes no sense .
she &apos;s suing both firms for $ 6 million .
i mean , even if we settle ,
$ 3 million-- it won &apos;t destroy us .
they said they wanted to blame me .
for what ?
we couldn &apos;t hear the rest .
lockhart / gardner made a deal with mrs. gopnik ,
and she turned on alicia ?
it still wouldn &apos;t destroy us .
it would if alicia couldn &apos;t practice law .
if we lose alicia ,
we lose chumhum , paisley , a lot of others .
they &apos;re trying to disbar her ?
is there any other mistake in the adoption work ?
something disbarrable ?
i don &apos;t think so , but david lee was involved ,
so anything &apos;s possible .
okay , so , we go through the discovery .
we go through everything .
wait .
you know , just get it ready for &apos; em to come .
there &apos;s five lawyers and a court reporter , okay ?
just clear everything out .
yes .
hello , grace . what &apos;s up ?
no , it &apos;s mom .
we &apos;re looking for flour . where do you keep your flour ?
i &apos;m at work , mom . i &apos;m working !
found it .
oh , no problem . we got it .
who &apos;s there with you ?
jackie .
jackie &apos;s there ?
yeah . why ?
cary , this is exactly like the nsa .
we were outraged when they listened to us .
clarke , i &apos;m responsible for 60 employees .
this is a decision i made
because i don &apos;t want to see those 60 people out of work .
by that logic , you can justify any decision .
yes ... but i won &apos;t .
now , help us look through the adoption discovery .
so , how did he take it ?
not great .
but don &apos;t worry . he &apos;ll back out . it &apos;s his only play .
by the way , have you been , uh , wearing perfume back here ?
yeah . you don &apos;t like it ?
jackie .
she likes to sit at your desk when you &apos;re not here .
you know , it &apos;s odd that he wrote her as &quot; lady macbeth . &quot;
i think &quot; mother macbeth &quot; would have made more sense .
well , who &apos;s our replacement going to be ?
for jackie ? i don &apos;t know .
i could make up a list .
very funny .
someone who &apos;s already vetted .
you &apos;re getting a reputation .
what about diane ?
diane lockhart ?
she &apos;s already been vetted .
you don &apos;t think she &apos;d make a good state &apos;s attorney ?
i think she &apos;d make a great state &apos;s attorney .
i don &apos;t know if she &apos;d do it .
we stood her up at the altar already , remember ?
let &apos;s set up a meeting .
persuade her .
she &apos;d bring real stature to the office .
so , howard , what do i have to do to get your vote ?
what do you have to do ?
i don &apos;t know . what can you do ?
well , you &apos;ve been wanting a different office for quite a while .
no . i &apos;m good .
canning offered it to you ?
no .
maybe .
what do you want , howard ?
you know how long i &apos;ve been a lawyer ?
55 years .
really ?
yeah . in all of those 55 years ,
never once have i cross @-@ examined anybody .
you want to question a witness ?
well , i was second chair on the paisley case ,
and i liked it .
excuse me . ms. lockhart ?
uh , not right now , bonnie .
the governor is on line two .
okay , i &apos;ll , uh ... i &apos;ll get it .
howard , if you vote my way ,
i will let you question in court .
mr. canning and david lee will do the same .
no , they won &apos;t .
david lee doesn &apos;t think you &apos;re up to it .
i do . one second .
hello , governor florrick .
hi , diane . thanks for taking my call .
listen , uh , could we meet with you sometime today , eli and myself ?
you and ... ?
uh , certainly . regarding ?
well , i think it would be better if we explained it in person .
so , how about around 5 : 00 ? is that good for you ?
uh , good .
i @-@ i look forward to it .
see you then .
the supreme court ?
i don &apos;t know . i mean , that would be odd .
well , they haven &apos;t filled the seat yet .
it &apos;s probably nothing .
a committee or something .
come with me .
what ?
no . i want a ... i want a posse there .
uh , diane , i @-@ i really don &apos;t think i &apos;m right .
yes , you are right .
howard , how would you like to question a witness today ?
uh , i think we should ...
it &apos;s a deposition .
whatever he doesn &apos;t cover , we &apos;ll follow up .
what do you say , howard ?
anything yet ? i &apos;m being deposed in about 30 minutes .
nothing yet .
they could have kept it out of discovery .
if david lee had anything to do with it , that &apos;s my bet .
you think they &apos;re gonna sandbag me at the deposition ?
possibly .
here &apos;s the other thing .
robyn and i were talking .
we think you should go over there to be deposed .
lockhart / gardner ? why ?
so they don &apos;t turn off the teleconferencing camera , or ... ?
not just that .
tell them you want to discuss the discovery ,
what documents are missing .
they &apos;re not gonna say anything .
not in your presence .
you &apos;re kidding .
no . after you leave , we &apos;ll see
what they say about missing documents .
it &apos;s smart .
it &apos;s slimy .
they &apos;re trying to set us up .
trying to set you up .
it &apos;s not slimy . it &apos;s self @-@ defense .
mrs. florrick , thanks for coming to our place .
it wasn &apos;t necessary .
i didn &apos;t want any misunderstanding in the transmission .
mr. schmidt , mr. canning , diane .
i never rate , do i ?
david .
how are you ?
peachy keen .
shall we start ?
i have no questions for alicia .
diane ?
yes , howard actually has some questions .
wait . what ?
howard is going to examine alicia .
he ... no , he isn &apos;t .
yes , he is .
i have the utmost confidence in howard .
you don &apos;t , david ?
do you , uh , want us to step out for a second ?
no , no .
we &apos;re good . howard ?
i ... - shut up . shut up .
lyman ? why howard lyman ?
he &apos;s an idiot .
is your name alicia florrick ?
it is .
and did you bribe the indian council ?
you mean , the tribal council ?
well , the tribal council and the indian council is the same thing .
i don &apos;t believe they refer to themselves with that colloquialism .
would you just answer the question ?
i did not bribe the tribal council .
and you expect us to believe that ?
i do .
you did everything else on the case .
yes , but david lee-- behind my back--
attempted to bribe the tribal council ,
and that &apos;s why this adoption fell through .
but , uh , what is this ?
a xerox of a take @-@ out menu .
what is this ?
um , it &apos;s a transcript .
a transcript of a deposition , to be exact .
it &apos;s not offensive to say &quot; indian council . &quot;
they don &apos;t mind &quot; indian . &quot;
what the hell ?
would you read from here , mrs. florrick ?
question : &quot; how do you turn this thing on ?
is this the new kind of smart phone ? &quot; answer : &quot; yes . &quot;
wait a minute . wait a minute . wait a minute .
you mean , here .
question : &quot; on march 6 , 2013,
did you send chief joshua proudfoot of the chippewa nation
$ 10,000 in cash to induce the tribe
not to object to this adoption ? &quot;
answer : &quot; i did . &quot;
so you did ?
no . i just read that .
this was one of your associates being deposed .
but what does it say next ?
you want me to keep reading ?
i demand that you keep reading .
question :
&quot; and at whose direction did you deliver this inducement ? &quot;
answer : &quot; alicia florrick . &quot;
aha . there it is in black and white .
he &apos;s lying .
is he ?
or are you lying ?
he &apos;s lying .
why would the associate lie ?
there &apos;s no reason .
because he wanted to be made a partner here ,
and you made him a partner here .
it &apos;s not a reason .
actually , it is .
maybe it &apos;s a smokescreen ?
they &apos;re trying to lull us into a false sense of security ?
okay , so i &apos;m lulled .
good job , howard .
fun .
um , do you have a minute ?
i have a question i &apos;d like to ask you two .
what ?
okay , here we go .
i would like to do it in private ?
fine . we can go in my office .
damn it . keep them there .
actually , um , can we do it , uh , here ?
why ?
yeah , uh , i ... i didn &apos;t want to take will &apos;s office .
i just thought it would be best if clients didn &apos;t see it empty .
we can do it here .
uh , well , what is it ?
what documents did you leave out of the discovery ?
what documents ? no documents . what are you talking about ?
we made copies of everything when we left lockhart / gardner ,
so if there are any additional documents ,
we &apos;ll be able to check .
are you accusing us of ... ?
alicia , i @-@ i don &apos;t understand .
what are you saying ?
i don &apos;t want this to get confrontational .
i just want to warn you :
we &apos;ll look askance at any late @-@ arriving evidence .
okay , here we go .
what was that about ?
i have no idea .
she &apos;s warning us . why ?
not gonna say anything with diane there .
not unless ...
what ?
what is it ?
can you zoom in ?
not without them knowing .
can you record it ?
no .
it &apos;s a live stream . why ?
oh , it &apos;s not what we thought .
they don &apos;t have the wife that we thought .
it &apos;s not mrs. gopnik ?
no .
mrs lampard is here .
oh , great . in my office .
who is it ?
deena lampard .
who &apos;s that ?
neil gross &apos;s wife .
oh , crap .
yeah . they have mrs. chumhum , and we &apos;re screwed .
that smells good .
well , had to make due with what &apos;s here .
it &apos;s not my best .
why do you always do that ?
i just gave you a compliment ,
and you made it sound like an accusation .
i &apos;m just trying to explain why ...
ugh . you &apos;re right .
your daughter always accused me of the same thing .
i guess she &apos;s a lot like me ,
and peter &apos;s a lot like you .
now , that sounded like an accusation .
it did , didn &apos;t it ?
i see where alicia &apos;s drinking comes from .
and peter &apos;s rudeness .
no wonder they &apos;re splitting up .
what ?
no wonder they &apos;re splitting up ,
or not splitting up , or just doing the power couple thing .
what does that mean ?
forwarding their own careers
while sleeping with anyone they want .
they &apos;re not doing that .
oh , yes , they are .
where did you hear that ?
from my son .
alicia talks to him .
well , that &apos;s awful .
oh , it &apos;s fine .
they &apos;re getting along better than they did when they were sleeping together .
are you all right ?
i don &apos;t like the way you &apos;re waving this in my face .
i am hardly waving this in your face .
hi , mom .
oh , hi , honey .
it &apos;s not mom . how are you , grace ?
we &apos;re making dinner .
so ,
this isn &apos;t about mrs. gopnik at all ?
this is about mrs. gross ?
it looked like her .
last time i saw her was
during their fight over their prenup .
we lose chumhum ,
that would close our doors , right ?
it &apos;s still 75 % of our operating income .
does she have that much sway over her husband ?
did you try neil gross ?
he &apos;s traveling in china .
they said , &quot; does she believe you ? &quot;
that &apos;s what they said in the teleconference ?
yes .
so they &apos;re lying to her .
about us .
so we meet with her .
ask her if she &apos;s happy .
no .
cary , you do it . she liked you .
work your magic .
god , i am the new will .
sorry .
hello .
hey , it &apos;s me .
sorry to bother you at work .
oh , no , that &apos;s okay , peter .
what do you need ?
this is gonna seem like an odd question .
do you know where your casserole dish is ?
what ?
mother called . she said she couldn &apos;t call you .
they &apos;re making lasagna at your apartment .
oh , dear mother of god . she called you ?
they sound like they &apos;ve been drinking .
i &apos;m gonna kill them .
i &apos;m in a meeting , so i really don &apos;t know ...
peter , just tell them to stop .
this needs to stop . seriously .
i would go there myself with a hatchet ,
but i &apos;m in the middle of something here .
okay .
you didn &apos;t , uh ...
you didn &apos;t say anything to mother about us ,
about our situation , did you ?
to jackie ? no . why ?
she mentioned something about wanting to talk to both of us .
alicia , we need you over here .
uh , we &apos;re not talking to jackie .
i know .
anyway , how do you feel about tomorrow ?
tomorrow ?
empty nest ?
i &apos;ll be fine . i &apos;ll see you tonight at 8 : 00 .
oh , eli .
you busy ?
i thought we were only watching things that had to do with us .
this does .
alicia was open to the idea at one point ,
but others were reluctant .
what can we offer them ? guaranteed partnerships ?
they want to merge ?
diane does .
i don &apos;t think canning &apos;s scheme has anything to do with this .
cary wants three years of segregated chumhum money .
we can &apos;t do that .
i know .
can you talk to him , kalinda , see what you can do ?
i know we keep asking this of you ,
but it &apos;s important .
sure .
what can she do ?
i guess i don &apos;t understand .
kalinda has a way with cary .
we &apos;ve exploited this before .
so , canning will vote against the merger ,
so we wait until after the managing partnership vote .
i go to florrick @-@ agos . we guarantee them
an equal number of seats on the managing committees
and 18 months of segregated chumhum profit .
hello .
cary , uh , what are you doing ?
working .
are we still on for 6 : 00 this evening ?
6 : 00 .
do you still want to be ?
yeah . um , don &apos;t you ?
sure .
you &apos;re being weird .
look , i &apos;ll see you tonight at 6 : 00 , okay ?
yep .
we need to discuss this .
where ?
can i just say
this was a stupid design choice ?
we need someplace with walls and doors .
like lockhart / gardner ?
i think we should merge .
i disagree .
they &apos;re offering us
equal spots on management committees .
that &apos;s where all the decisions are made .
we could be the top firm in chicago .
yes .
and your name will be on the letterhead and mine won &apos;t .
you don &apos;t know that .
alicia ,
don &apos;t try to sell me .
you are the governor &apos;s wife . your name means something .
so we &apos;ll insist that yours is on it , too .
well , why would we do this ?
we said we wanted to build something from the ground up ,
something that we could be proud of .
why would we go back ?
because we &apos;re struggling .
because ...
i &apos;m tired .
what ?
i &apos;m tired !
i don &apos;t want to just keep struggling to stay alive .
that &apos;s not why you &apos;re tired .
excuse me ?
you are not tired because of work .
are we talking about will ?
is it about will ?
if you &apos;re angry at what kalinda said ,
you take it out on her .
i &apos;ve got the votes , cary .
i &apos;ve got the votes to get us to merge .
so that &apos;s how it &apos;ll be ?
fight to the death ?
no . we vote .
can you do something for me ?
just me .
you can &apos;t tell alicia .
what ?
sound out the partners . get a head count
on merging with lockhart / gardner .
no , we can &apos;t merge with them .
they &apos;ll lay off half our staff .
i know .
i need a vote count in an hour .
you got it .
bob , hey .
you got a minute to talk about this merger stuff ?
diane , thank you for coming in on such short notice .
of course . it &apos;s an honor .
i hope you don &apos;t mind if kalinda sits in .
she &apos;s become an invaluable girl friday .
kalinda , hi .
peter .
so , mr. governor ,
what is this pressing matter ?
well , we hated
how it ended up last year with the supreme court spot ,
and we wanted to bring this offer to you personally .
i &apos;m glad you did .
diane ,
how would you feel
about running for state &apos;s attorney ?
yes , we were endorsing finn polmar ,
but he &apos;s in the process of dropping out .
and , uh , you &apos;re pre @-@ vetted .
actually ,
we think you would also make a terrific state &apos;s attorney .
yes .
but not supreme court justice ?
well , unfortunately , that position
has been offered to harley joseph .
yes , i know .
this is an honor , diane .
we &apos;re offering to put all the power and prestige
of the governor &apos;s office behind you .
i really do hope you will ...
consider it .
uh , when do you need an answer ?
tomorrow . we need to play a little bit of catch @-@ up .
good . thank you .
i shall consider it .
you all right ?
you mean because they offered me the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office
and not supreme court justice ?
and they didn &apos;t come to me first ?
and they only came to me because i was pre @-@ vetted ?
am i all right with that ?
yeah .
peachy .
kalinda , could you find out , if i did run ,
what i would be up against ?
would i be conflicted out of my partnership ?
i &apos;m on it .
so you &apos;re considering it ?
i don &apos;t know . the world is so confusing right now .
i just might quit and go live in new zealand .
hey , cary ,
i &apos;m up here .
what ?
hey , slow down .
kalinda , just shut up .
excuse me ?
i am not one of your women .
i &apos;m not gonna go slow when you want me to go slow .
get off of me , cary .
why ? you don &apos;t like it like this ?
cary , get off of me .
i swear i &apos;ll hurt you .
what &apos;s going on ?
hello ?
hey , it &apos;s carey . the count is close .
i can &apos;t believe it , but alicia is up by two partners .
if the merger were voted on today , we would lose .
okay .
what are you gonna do ?
we can &apos;t merge with lockhart / gardner .
i &apos;ll talk with you .
what was that ?
is this private enough for you ?
mr. canning .
mr. agos .
we haven &apos;t had many dealings , have we ?
no .
you don &apos;t like me , do you ?
no .
what did you want to tell me ?
diane wants to merge with us .
she &apos;ll wait until she &apos;s voted in as managing partner
and then approach us about a merger .
how do you know this ?
you don &apos;t want a merger , and i don &apos;t want a merger .
so whatever moves you want to make ,
then make &apos; em now .
nice talking to you .
god , look at you .
you look so adult .
can i take it off now ?
no , you have to keep it on for the next 24 hours .
it &apos;s a law .
whew . you &apos;re all packed . what a good boy .
yeah , i &apos;m leaving tomorrow .
yeah , so alicia said .
i think she &apos;s sad .
no .
she did the same thing to me .
left right after graduation .
didn &apos;t want the tears , didn &apos;t want the hugs .
she left that same night .
really ?
we didn &apos;t have time for a cake .
she was so anxious to get away from me .
did she have a summer internship ?
no ,
she just wanted to get started looking for an apartment .
i cried like a baby .
kids are tougher .
they know better .
i think i smell the cake burning .
does that smell like the cake &apos;s burning ?
hello ?
front door &apos;s open .
hello ?
jackie , how are we ?
oh , mr. gold .
what a surprise .
canning and david lee are scheming again .
they &apos;ve got howard .
he won &apos;t switch back to us . idiot .
we got another problem .
i just heard that diane is offering a merger with florrick @-@ agos
if she gets the managing partnership .
she &apos;ll give florrick @-@ agos all the top positions
on the management committees .
oh , what the hell ?
how did you find out ?
that kid on the other side .
what is his name ? uh ...
the name partner .
cary ... he told me .
what ?
is this true ?
did you really go to canning , cary ? did you ?
yes .
why the hell ... ? !
because a merger is a mistake .
do you know what a betrayal this is ? !
i know if we join lockhart / gardner ,
it will be over .
well , then argue that , discuss that ,
but you don &apos;t go to the other side .
i will argue that .
but they should know what diane is doing .
diane is operating in secret .
no , no , no .
don &apos;t turn this into some selfless act .
i &apos;m not turning it into anything .
you wanted to sabotage diane &apos;s efforts .
it will only sabotage it
if she doesn &apos;t have the support .
oh , that is such a load of crap , cary .
well , i &apos;m sorry i don &apos;t hold up to your standards !
you wanted to take this offer right out of our hands !
let &apos;s take this outside .
no !
i can &apos;t believe you .
it &apos;s so wrong .
what was wrong was listening to them at all .
if i did this , you would be appalled ,
and you would have every right to be .
what i hate is that you are arguing
for a merger that will benefit you !
well , if that &apos;s what mattered to you ,
cary , argue for that .
what about the 30 paralegals ?
what about the other people ?
oh , you know what ? go to hell , cary .
if you think so little ...
that is your answer to anything you can &apos;t deal with !
if you think so little of our partnership ,
we should quit this now !
you should cool down .
no . you should take this more seriously .
what ?
hey . is this a bad time ?
no . there &apos;s no good timing these days .
how are you ?
i &apos;m dropping out .
oh , finn .
are you sure ?
yeah .
yeah , look , it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s ...
the right thing to do .
and , you know , i @-@ i talked to my parents ,
and they were both ... really supportive ,
but i just don &apos;t want them to suffer anymore , so ...
and i heard they &apos;re out to diane lockhart .
what ?
they &apos;ve asked diane to step in in my stead .
well . and then there were two .
i &apos;m amazed by you , mr. canning .
this is your fourth week at my firm--
a firm that i &apos;ve built from the ground up
over the last nine years--
and you &apos;re already knocking at the door of managing partnership .
i &apos;m knocking , but i &apos;m afraid that door &apos;s not gonna open .
you have howard . you @-@ you have the votes .
you want some whiskey ?
sure .
my meds are just kicking in . this could be interesting .
so ...
what scheme do you have for me now ?
what scheme ?
yes .
you don &apos;t scratch your nose without there being some plan .
are you familiar with the nuclear option ?
no .
it &apos;s a notice of dissolution .
as partner , i have unilateral right to dissolve the firm ...
with @-@ with cause .
and what would that cause be ?
acquisitions were made without the full consent of the partnership .
the west coast , east coast offices were acquired .
by will , a partner who is dead .
unfortunately , the courts still hold
the current managing partnership accountable .
why are you doing this ?
thought that was clear . i want to be managing partner .
you &apos;re dying .
my work is my life .
if i don &apos;t work , i &apos;ll die sooner .
so , if you don &apos;t get the partnership ,
you will dissolve this firm ?
no , you will dissolve this firm .
i want this firm to be strong .
i want there to be ... a consensus going forward .
blah , blah , blah , blah , blah .
what are you gonna do ?
do you mean , do i let canning take the managing partnership ,
or fight him and watch my firm dissolve ?
he &apos;s right about will .
the expenditures were made without a full vote .
there &apos;s always option number three .
you could run for state &apos;s attorney .
i don &apos;t think i have the ...
the fight left in me , kalinda .
if will were still here , i ...
i &apos;m here .
you &apos;ve decided ?
yes .
good .
i &apos;ll be home as soon as i can . something just came up .
what ?
something important . i &apos;m sorry .
tell zach i &apos;ll be home as soon as i can ?
please hurry .
she &apos;s playing you for a fool .
mother , what does that even mean ?
it means , alicia wants the power of your office
without giving anything in return . she ...
hi , veronica .
peter . i thought i &apos;d put out the lasagna .
your daughter &apos;s going to be late again . i &apos;d wait .
well , that &apos;s what happens when you work for a living , jackie ,
a concept that &apos;s probably alien to you .
bitch .
all right , all right , all right , please , please , girls .
thank you for giving me a moment so late at night .
i , um ... i have a proposal for you to consider .
diane ,
any merger would requirea , three @-@ year window on chumhum .
cary , we don &apos;t decide until we vote .
nothing &apos;s decided until we get a proposal .
and i &apos;m saying that a proposal would require ...
you don &apos;t have the right to say ...
alicia , cary , why don &apos;t we leave it to our guest to talk ?
that &apos;s all i wanted .
alicia . please . we &apos;re here to listen .
i know we &apos;ve talked a lot about a merger .
i have my own dissenting voices at lockhart / gardner .
many don &apos;t want to let you back in the door .
great .
cary .
but even if we were to make a deal tonight ,
my concern is that it would dissolve very quickly .
a merger , i &apos;m afraid , would make lockhart / gardner unwieldy .
so , you &apos;ve come here to propose not merging ?
i don &apos;t understand .
no .
i &apos;ve come here to ask if you will take me .
holy crap .
me .
and my $ 38 million a year in client billing .
are you sure , diane ?
okay , i &apos;ll tell peter .
thank you for considering it .
bye .
why is everything ... so difficult ?
raymond fitzmorris .
anna fitzpatrick .
zachary florrick .
addison garisovic .
stephanie green .
i &apos;m sorry i was late .
it &apos;s fine . you weren &apos;t .
you saw it . the rest was boring .
i &apos;m so proud of you , zach .
thanks , mom .
you &apos;re all packed up ?
uh , yeah . sam called . he wants to leave tonight .
what ?
well , just so we can get a jump on the traffic .
we &apos;ll drive through the night ,
and we &apos;ll get there tomorrow morning .
you okay with that ?
yeah .
i just wish there was more time .
i &apos;ll be home for thanksgiving .
i love you .
i love you , too .
i &apos;ll call you when i get there .
it &apos;s been a weird day .
yeah .
weird year .
alicia ?
yes ?
would you want to run for state &apos;s attorney ?
what ?
