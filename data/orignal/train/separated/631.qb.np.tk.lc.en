i &apos;ve been finishing the carrion
the people that took your dad
don &apos;t have the best track record
when it comes to fulfilling their end of the bargain .
aiden mathis , welcome aboard .
kenny was driving that boat ?
makes sense ,
considering no one came forward
to say they saved your life .
they &apos;re hiding their money in this foundation
in case there &apos;s an investigation and their assets are frozen .
if we can access that account ,
we could bankrupt the graysons .
whoever wrote the code protecting this bank account
is the same person that sealed your father &apos;s fate .
the falcon is back .
my foster brother showed up .
eli was my protector till i burnt down our house .
eli james .
we would love for you to be a guest
at the inaugural benefit in your sister &apos;s name .
looking pretty good for a dead girl .
you &apos;re not worried that i &apos;m gonna mess things up , are you ?
in the art of war ...
if you know the enemy and know yourself ...
you need not fear the approaching battles .
amanda .
eli ?
reading this book a thousand times won &apos;t change what he did .
what are you doing back here ?
you got picked by that family .
we made a promise , remember ?
stay together , no matter what .
but if you know only yourself and not your enemy ...
for every victory ...
emily ?
there will also be defeat .
i take it this is not you trying to i. d. the falcon .
nolan &apos;s on that .
i found out that eli &apos;s been in contact with our foster mother .
miss hayward . i thought she was horrible to you .
she was . made a small fortune taking in older ,
unwanted orphans , scamming the agencies ,
convincing them the money went to better our lives .
it didn &apos;t .
and these are the kids you lived with ?
and this is where they are now .
addicts , prostitutes , felons .
eli &apos;s got into your head ...
and your heart , which means he has to go .
i know , but i can &apos;t hurt him .
i need time .
what &apos;s happening at grayson global ?
precious little .
since i was upgraded to the board ,
daniel &apos;s gone oddly quiet .
as for daniel , he &apos;s gonna keep you out of the loop
so long as he &apos;s planning on making you his patsy .
but i know him .
he &apos;s under a lot of pressure . he &apos;s gonna need to confide in someone .
and we both know who that &apos;s gonna be .
daniel , it &apos;s emily .
mr. taylor , nice to hear your voice .
is there a time when we could safely speak ?
sure . how about in person ?
um , can you have lunch tomorrow , say ... 1 : 00 ?
that &apos;s perfect .
terrific . i &apos;ll text you the details .
okay .
grace ?
1 : 00 for 2 tomorrow at cafe arnaud .
make it under taylor .
well , grayson will get you a better table .
after i got into it with that guy the other day ,
the paparazzi &apos;s been gunning for me .
can &apos;t be too careful .
do you have a number for mr. taylor
so i can let him know ?
i &apos;ll handle it . thanks , grace .
daniel is far too trusting of the women with whom he involves himself .
i don &apos;t need to tell you
how much of a problem it would pose
if daniel were to unburden himself of recent events onto emily thorne .
conrad , for once , i hate to say that i agree with you ,
but it &apos;s exactly that misguided affection
that we can use to keep daniel quiet .
conrad .
oh , good morning , ms. davenport .
not for you , it isn &apos;t .
your polling numbers are abysmal .
well , these numbers are based solely on boors
watching their daytime talk shows ,
answering their rotary phones .
that kind of talk will hardly capture
the hearts and minds of people who don &apos;t own
multimillion @-@ dollar second and third homes .
the only positive was the bumps you received
following the announcement of the amanda clarke foundation
and your tv appearance with jack porter .
and i believe there &apos;s a way to continue raising awareness
for both our causes .
always interested in a fresh idea .
aren &apos;t we all ? i hope i &apos;m not too late .
emily , we were just about to start a private meeting .
well , actually , i invited her .
after you appointed me co @-@ chair ,
emily here offered her services .
so what have i missed ?
well , mr. james here was about to rescue my campaign .
well , in truth , mr. grayson ,
it &apos;s more about the foundation and amanda .
now this is something i truly believe can be a benefit .
that &apos;s meredith hayward .
she was my foster mother , and amanda &apos;s .
well , if this is the woman whose house amanda burned down ,
what makes you think she would want to take part
in a foundation bearing amanda &apos;s name ?
well , it &apos;s simple .
mrs. h. always taught us the power of forgiveness .
but in recent years ,
hayward house has fallen on hard times .
so you think the a. c. f. should sponsor her home ?
out of the ashes , a beacon of hope ?
and with amanda &apos;s connection to jack porter ,
it &apos;s a win @-@ win for your campaign ...
and the foundation .
well , then , since it &apos;s mr. james &apos; idea ,
i think he should run with it .
well , great . i &apos;ll go pitch mrs. h. the idea today .
i would love to accompany you .
it &apos;s a great way to see how amanda grew up .
by all means .
mr. eli james--
there &apos;s a young man to watch .
i &apos;ll say .
nolan .
padma , you &apos;re supposed to be in hiding . it is not safe for you here .
it &apos;s not safe for me anywhere . i just received this .
my father &apos;s not dead .
padma , meri jaan , listen carefully .
there is an alley between oswald and drake ,
near the east river .
in two days &apos; time , you must come with the carrion program .
come at noon . bring nothing else and no one else .
otherwise , they will kill me and you .
oh , my god . where &apos;s carrion ?
in a safe deposit box .
okay , i &apos;m gonna need to make some adjustments to its flash drive .
padma , i swear to you , on my life ,
i won &apos;t let any harm come to you or your father .
but , uh ... we &apos;re gonna need some reinforcements .
i trust you .
good .
so what &apos;s your end game , eli ?
i &apos;m just trying to make the amanda clarke foundation
the best it can be .
yeah , i realized that
when you invested my $ 100,000 into it .
if you &apos;re not here for the money , then what do you want ?
you act like you don &apos;t remember what that bitch did to us .
no ! let go of me !
i remember just fine .
well , then let me tell you something
you couldn &apos;t possibly remember .
she kept a bunch of letters your father had written you .
you &apos;re lying .
doesn &apos;t seem like a man who didn &apos;t love his daughter to me .
where did you get this ?
i found it
in hayward &apos;s safe after they took you away .
i could only pocket one before she caught me .
as far as i know , she &apos;s still got the rest .
i want to get them back for you .
why ?
&apos;cause i once made you a promise to always look after you .
and hayward deserves to be punished .
look , i &apos;m doing this with or without you .
fine .
but we do it my way .
did he tell you what he wrote in the letters ?
a rebuttal of everything that treadwell lied about .
when you never answered ,
he created those journals for you .
look , ems , there was nothing that david wrote
that would &apos;ve changed anything .
you know now--
it could &apos;ve changed everything , nolan .
if i &apos;d have known that my father was reaching out ,
i might not have lost him ,
i might not have lit that fire ,
i might not have gone to juvie .
and amanda--
might .
might still be alive .
where are you going ?
driving down with eli to manage our foster mother situation .
but first , i want to check on jack .
well , not to sound all needy ,
but we do have the whole carrion / padma &apos;s father
exchange thing to deal with ,
and i could really use your help .
and when the time comes , i &apos;ll be there .
aiden will fill you in .
did you bring carrion ?
what &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s a flash drive with a tracking device built into the head .
we &apos;ll know where it is at all times .
that &apos;s a good backup .
here . have a look .
the top floor of this car park provides
an excellent advantage place for exchange .
when padma &apos;s father &apos;s released , i &apos;ll simply take out the players .
the plan is to ... shoot people ?
not people , nolan . terrorists .
what--what makes you think that blowing people &apos;s brains out
won &apos;t put a bigger target on the laharis &apos; head ?
they can &apos;t harm them if they can &apos;t find them .
padma and her father are gonna have to disappear .
what ?
for good ?
emily has already found their new identities and a location .
i &apos;m sorry , nolan , but the only way
to save padma is to , um ...
let her go .
how you doing ?
little guy keep you up all night ?
no , no , no .
carl slept through the night . i just ...
can &apos;t stomach that empty bed .
looks like you &apos;ve been busy .
any luck finding kenny ?
no . none .
his apartment &apos;s empty . his phone &apos;s been disconnected .
there &apos;s no activity on his credit cards .
nolan .
i promised i wouldn &apos;t give up , but i ...
i keep hitting these dead ends .
if i can &apos;t find kenny , i may never know
exactly what happened to amanda , or worse ,
why it happened .
well , maybe don &apos;t give up just yet .
i think i have an idea .
jack , you in there ?
don &apos;t do anything stupid .
i &apos;m not gonna do ...
emily .
you know what ? i gotta get back to class .
but , uh , i &apos;ll see you later .
okay .
bye , emily .
you &apos;re not returning my calls .
yeah , i was busy .
still trying to figure out a way to get back at conrad ?
even if i wanted to go after conrad ,
he stole the computer , which was my only leverage .
stole it ... while my wife was being buried .
anyway ...
i need to focus on carl .
what &apos;s done is done .
jack , i think you &apos;re doing the right thing .
amanda wouldn &apos;t have wanted you to fight this battle for her .
she wanted you to be happy .
you &apos;re right .
it &apos;s gotta be one or the other .
how &apos;s jack ?
he &apos;s beat up , you know ?
there are a lot of unanswered questions .
i wish i could do something about it .
uh , how--how are you ?
it &apos;s been nice having amanda &apos;s foster brother around .
i think you &apos;d like eli if you got to know him .
yeah , i &apos;m sure i would .
good , because he &apos;s working on a partnership between the foundation
and the foster mother he shared with amanda .
i was hoping we could announce it
at the stowaway--
amanda &apos;s final home--
if you think jack would be okay with that .
yeah . you know , he &apos;d do anything for amanda ,
and so would i , so i think that &apos;s a great idea .
thank you , declan .
yeah .
i &apos;m gonna call eli and tell him the good news .
okay .
oh , i &apos;m sorry , trey .
what the hell , porter ?
yeah , my bad .
watch where you &apos;re going , man .
sorry .
so we &apos;re getting new identities ?
yeah .
aiden will get them to you and your father on the way to the airport .
where are we going ?
i don &apos;t know . i ... i can &apos;t know .
are you saying i may never see you again ?
it &apos;s the only way to ensure that the initiative never finds you .
you &apos;ll have plenty of cash
and substantial bank accounts--
i don &apos;t care about any of that .
i can &apos;t fly off somewhere
and live the rest of my life without you .
i love you .
and i love you , too ,
so much .
this isn &apos;t the way that things end for us .
someday ... you &apos;ll be ...
sitting on a beach somewhere ,
and you &apos;ll find out that the initiative was exposed
and the threat is gone .
you better be walking down that beach ten seconds later .
i will be running .
any sign that she recognizes me , and we walk .
hello .
you must be ms. thorne .
emily . nice to meet you .
thank you so much for seeing us on such short notice .
well , anything for poor amanda clarke .
she was very special to me .
i &apos;m afraid that time is not on the children &apos;s side .
without full payment and penalty ,
i &apos;ll lose this house at the end of the month .
oh , don &apos;t worry about that .
when the graysons put their resources to work ,
things happen very quickly .
but we hope to present you a check
to cover all your expenses at a press conference tomorrow .
my goodness . that is fast .
i know this is a long shot ,
but we &apos;re also wondering if you still have any
personal items from amanda &apos;s youth ,
anything to potentially connect donors to her past ?
oh , i &apos;m afraid i can &apos;t help you with that .
anything that was personal of amanda &apos;s
would &apos;ve been lost in the fire .
of course .
you know , i &apos;d love to meet some of your current kids .
you know , maybe we can feature them in our new literature .
oh , well , i &apos;ll introduce you around .
you know , i actually have to return a phone call ,
so i &apos;ll-- i &apos;ll catch up with you .
you go ahead .
just follow my lead .
we &apos;re gonna soak these people for more money
than you &apos;d make in a lifetime fleecing the state .
thanks for this , eli .
you have no idea how much i need this money .
look , i &apos;m not doing this out of the goodness of my heart .
i &apos;m doing this because you taught me
how to seize a good opportunity .
kicking me back 60 % of this scam
is gonna heal a lot of wounds .
trust me .
no ! let go of me !
no !
no parent will ever want you .
emily ?
i wouldn &apos;t miss it .
okay . thank you .
sorry . i got lost trying to find you .
what you have created here is truly impressive .
well , i hope this means i &apos;ve passed inspection .
with flying colors .
meredith , i &apos;ve heard so many wonderful things about you .
one only need to look at eli to understand why .
well , eli was always very special to me ,
as was amanda clarke .
oh , how nice .
though i don &apos;t think i could ever forgive anyone
who set fire to everything i cared about .
i think you need to see it from amanda &apos;s perspective .
i mean , she felt like she couldn &apos;t trust anyone .
and being a motherless child ,
and her father turning out to be this other ... person ,
she just had so much pain .
indeed .
i &apos;ve long since forgiven her .
we &apos;ll present the first check to you
at the press conference this afternoon .
the first ?
yes , the one to take care of your
remaining mortgage .
the rest of the funds will be used
to ensure that amanda &apos;s former home
remains a place where other unwanted children
can flourish for years to come .
not to sound crass ,
but what sort of donation are we talking about ?
$ 250,000 ...
annually .
but does that sound reasonable ?
you are truly a godsend , victoria .
oh , don &apos;t be silly .
i figured trey would have
kenny &apos;s number in his phone , right ?
so i @-@ i rolled him .
&quot; 时间和地点 &quot; &quot; 明天下午3点 足球场 &quot; &quot; 好的 别张扬 &quot;
so you &apos;re sure that kenny has no idea
that you &apos;re the one who was texting him ?
no , he &apos;s got no clue .
he thinks he &apos;s meeting trey in a half an hour , though ,
on the field , so you better get moving .
i &apos;ll watch carl .
thanks , man .
you got my vote , mr. grayson .
thank you , sir .
what the hell &apos;s that about ?
that would be me . i @-@ i think i might have told charlotte
that they could use the bar for a press conference .
i &apos;m sorry .
ah , jack .
i wanted to thank you
for allowing us the use of the tavern .
yeah , sure , but you &apos;ll have to excuse me .
i &apos;m running late .
actually , we were hoping to discuss
involving you with the campaign
in a more official capacity .
our very own , uh , &quot; joe the plumber , &quot; if you will .
you want me to convince the poor guy
to vote for the rich guy ?
in the most reductive terms , yes .
i &apos;ll think about it .
apologies for the cloak and dagger .
i know this place wasn &apos;t easy to find .
no , i &apos;m just happy to see you .
i &apos;ve been ... worried since we last spoke .
well , i have to admit ,
as much as i hate involving you in all of this ...
it &apos;s , uh , it &apos;s a huge relief ,
being able to confide in you again .
have you found a solution
to your ...
here you are , sir .
problem ?
i &apos;m sorry , but they &apos;ve chosen aiden to take the fall ...
if it comes to that .
look , emily , you need to know ,
this wasn &apos;t about jealousy .
it was the circumstances .
all right , taking my father &apos;s seat on the board
made him the best option .
any idea what they &apos;re planning ?
no , i ... i &apos;m still digging there .
listen , i promise ,
i &apos;ll make sure you &apos;re safe , okay ?
i don &apos;t want to give them any reason to target you .
yeah , go ahead if you need to take that .
excuse me .
is everything okay ?
no . they changed the drop time .
padma &apos;s has to deliver carrion in exactly 36 minutes .
what ? i &apos;m in new haven .
there &apos;s no way i &apos;ll make it on time .
what are you doing up there ?
i have that lunch with daniel .
right . well , i &apos;ll have to handle this alone .
i &apos;ve got to go .
we cannot do this without emily .
we don &apos;t have a choice .
can you stop breathing so heavily ?
well , i &apos;m sorry to bother you , lee harvey .
i guess i just get a little nervous
when i &apos;m about to kill people .
you &apos;re not killing anybody .
well , by association , yes , i am .
just keep her safe , okay ?
don &apos;t worry .
lack of rehearsal aside , the plan remains the same .
once mr. lahari &apos;s feet hit the ground ,
so do her captors .
here they come .
stay down .
three passengers .
is one of them padma &apos;s father ?
i can &apos;t tell .
it &apos;s a pleasure to meet you in the flesh , ms. lahari .
i know that voice .
where &apos;s my father ?
program , please .
whoever &apos;s in the back &apos;s authenticating the program .
you got what you wanted .
now release my father .
this way , please .
our association , ms. lahari ...
has proved quite problematic .
you bastard !
there &apos;s interference .
i--they &apos;re arguing . i--
i have trask . i &apos;m taking the shot .
no , no , no ! not until you see padma &apos;s father .
they don &apos;t have her father .
damn it !
what have we done ?
where is he ?
he &apos;s there , just behind that door .
papa ?
padma .
unlock it .
before the reunion ,
there &apos;s one more thing i must ask of you .
the deal was for carrion .
take a seat .
you &apos;re a tough man to reach .
don &apos;t tempt me .
you and i are gonna talk now .
i appreciate it .
thanks again for letting us do this here .
it means a lot to both of us .
yeah , it &apos;s the least i could do .
you guys put it together fast , didn &apos;t you ?
excuse me .
we just need a couple of good shots for the campaign .
i &apos;ll have to give you credit . it &apos;s an impressive turnout .
well , it &apos;s a testament to the enduring power
of the grayson family name .
here &apos;s to taking that name all the way to the governor &apos;s mansion .
don &apos;t even think about lying to me .
i have the registration for the boat
you dragged me back to shore in .
i told you , i don &apos;t own a boat .
and i didn &apos;t rescue you !
i sure as hell didn &apos;t have anything to do with nate .
grayson must be covering his tracks .
or you &apos;re screwing with me right now .
no , i swear to you ...
whatever grayson had him doing ,
my brother was working solo .
the reason that you came to my bar
is you wanted someone to pay for your father &apos;s death .
now someone has to pay for amanda &apos;s .
you say that you &apos;re different from your brother .
now &apos;s your chance to prove it .
come on .
all right , man . all right .
there is something i didn &apos;t tell the cops .
but i &apos;ve been holding on to it in case grayson came after me .
what ?
nate taped their meetings ...
for protection against being cut out .
i swiped them from his apartment .
i want those recordings .
it &apos;s distressing to know that there are over 500,000 children
in the american foster care system ,
a system woefully lacking in funding .
but i &apos;m pleased to report
that the amanda clarke foundation
阿曼达 · 克拉克基金会
is ready to meet this challenge head on .
and here to introduce our maiden outreach
is amanda &apos;s foster brother and foundation co @-@ chair-- eli james .
eli .
thank you .
from 1996 to 1999,
i lived at miss hayward &apos;s house with several other children ,
including amanda clarke .
those were the darkest days of my life .
under the guise of discipline ,
miss hayward ruled her house with fear and intimidation ,
pocketing government and charity money
while frequently withholding food and water from us ,
keeping us ...
e @-@ eli--
locked in a metal coal bin for hours or even days at a time .
no , no . none of this is true .
now this abuse went on undetected for years
and continues till this very day .
none of this is true , any of it .
victoria ,
even as a boy , eli was pathological .
i &apos;m afraid i was just naive enough to believe he &apos;d changed .
you don &apos;t have to take my word for it .
take theirs ...
the faces of hayward house--
grown @-@ up , but still bearing the scars
of our time spent with mrs. hayward .
now we &apos;ve come here today to tell our stories .
then tell them
what you did to your dear little sister .
tell everyone
how you set the fire at my house
and let amanda clarke take the blame ,
for which she did five years in juvenile detention .
tell them .
i should &apos;ve let you burn .
upset ? i am livid .
you told me this woman was a worthy cause .
i had to keep you out of the loop to keep your hands clean .
you just shredded every bit of this foundation &apos;s credibility .
no . you spin this the right way ,
people will see you as a hero .
be that as it may ,
you are no longer welcome in this foundation or in my home .
is it true ?
you set the fire ?
yes .
the one you lit burned out .
so i restarted it .
but only to get you in trouble .
i didn &apos;t know how out of control it would get ,
but ... just that it was a matter of time
before a family adopted you out .
i mean , we had a pact to stay together .
do you have any idea what lighting that fire did ?
my whole life could &apos;ve been different , eli .
it was selfish , i know , and i &apos;m sorry .
but i &apos;m trying to make it up to you now .
the only way to do that is to leave .
and if you so much as even think about exposing my identity--
i would never do that to you .
look , i &apos;m trying to make things right between us .
you &apos;ll see .
eli ...
it &apos;s clear .
they should be here .
the--the locator says we &apos;re in the right place .
oh , no .
what ?
&quot; sorry about your friend , nolan .
it &apos;s a terrible thing to lose one &apos;s ... head . &quot;
aiden , don &apos;t .
it &apos;s the tracking device .
they knew all along .
and now ... we &apos;ve given our enemy
the most unimaginably dangerous program known to man
and put two innocent peoples &apos; lives in unimaginable danger .
you really should consider another line of work .
okay , look , let &apos;s say somebody was able to remove
this leverage you &apos;re talking about .
is the deal back on ?
as it stands , mr. ryan , that &apos;s a purely hypothetical question .
we never had this conversation .
the son of a bitch practically ordered a hit on you .
yeah ,
hypothetically ...
and with carefully chosen words .
and , uh , what &apos;s the--
what &apos;s the leverage he mentioned ?
it &apos;s something i haven &apos;t told you about yet .
look , it &apos;s gonna sound crazy ,
but amanda was collecting evidence against conrad .
what evidence ?
i don &apos;t know what ,
but she used it to blackmail him ,
to get us the bar back .
amanda did that for us ?
and he had her killed for it .
all right . well , then we gotta take that to the police .
we gotta do something .
no , we can &apos;t go to the police .
we can &apos;t trust the police ,
especially not when it comes to the ryans .
they had me put in jail , remember ?
yes .
the only people we can trust are each other .
yeah , but this is proof . jack , we have proof .
they gotta pay for this , and this--
this doesn &apos;t prove anything to anyone but me .
now i know that conrad was behind nate
being on the boat . i just need ...
to find some contract between the two of them ,
some proof that money changed hands .
and how are you gonna do that ?
knock , knock .
they took the kids .
they &apos;re going to open an investigation .
good .
it &apos;s too bad amanda died
before she could find out what you did to her .
you &apos;re right .
i owe her .
as a matter of fact ...
that &apos;s why i &apos;m here .
i feel like i failed you .
nolan , there was no way i could &apos;ve made it there on time .
it wouldn &apos;t have mattered anyway .
they have been ahead of us ...
every step of the way .
and now ...
they &apos;ll probably kill her , if they haven &apos;t already .
and i told her , ems ...
i promised her that i would keep her safe .
nolan , look at me .
i don &apos;t know if padma &apos;s still alive .
but i do know that if she is ,
you are the only person that can find her .
i should &apos;ve let aiden shoot .
don &apos;t say that . did you ... track the source of the text ?
i tried .
the encryption &apos;s insane .
it &apos;s gonna take weeks .
well , then nolan you need to get started .
look at me . i know that you are hurting ,
but you need to stop blaming yourself ,
get on your computer , and dig until you find them .
and i swear to god , when you do ,
i will help you save her .
i give you my word .
unbelievable .
go ahead .
no .
yes .
take it .
i &apos;ve got work to do .
i thought i told you to go away .
not until you and i are square .
please ...
eli , where are you ?
if you let me out now , i promise ,
i won &apos;t tell anybody .
what are you doing ?
getting your letters back like i promised you .
another letter ?
no .
a confession .
she sold the letters to some guy years ago .
it &apos;s all in here .
and hayward ?
she &apos;ll live .
the less you know , the better .
you think you &apos;ll ... ever forgive me ?
what &apos;s done is done .
right .
well , you take care of yourself .
good @-@ bye .
eli .
thank you .
ah , mr. porter .
am i interrupting ?
no , no , no , no , not at all .
ms. davenport was just about to embark
on some damage control for my campaign .
now what can i do for you ?
well , i &apos;ve--i &apos;ve given some thought to your offer .
and i accept .
and i &apos;m delighted .
after yesterday &apos;s fiasco ,
there &apos;s no one i &apos;d rather have beside me on the campaign trail .
welcome aboard .
any luck ?
getting closer . the text was spoofed .
it came from a computer , not a phone ,
then was bounced around through several s.m.s. servers .
i am just pulling up the header details now .
look . there it is again .
falcon &apos;s signature .
the falcon &apos;s working for the initiative ?
well , they must have poached him from the graysons
after he helped frame david clarke .
which means he may have access to every transaction
the initiative or the graysons have ever made .
which also means that the people holding padma
might be digitally walled off
by the one person on this planet
who might be better at this than i am .
you &apos;ve reached emily . leave a message .
mr. taylor , daniel grayson .
i wanted to follow up on our lunch meeting .
i &apos;m sorry , daniel .
uh , this just came for you . it &apos;s marked &quot; urgent . &quot;
i &apos;ll--i &apos;ll call you back .
thank you .
what , no cake ?
you &apos;ve been keeping something from me , mason .
my guess is , you &apos;re not referring to my recipe
for brewed @-@ in @-@ the toilet prison wine .
i &apos;m talking about the letters from my father .
the ones that you bought from meredith hayward .
hayward gave me up , did she ?
give me the letters , mason .
sadly , i cannot .
those letters were reduced to smoke , my dear ,
along with everything else i owned
when you burned down my house last summer .
you obviously read them
so you know what he wrote .
oh , i do .
one of them was so revealing
that i suspect it might even blow your mind ,
but tell me , what &apos;s in it for me ?
do i really need to remind you
that only i have the power to release you
or see to it that you die in there ,
just like my father did ?
and let &apos;s not forget mason ,
you need me to finish your new book .
tell me what he wrote .
he was worried about you being in some kind of ...
dickensian foster home ,
&apos;cause he had witnessed firsthand
the anguish of another parent who ...
surrendered her firstborn son to just such a facility many years ago .
who was he talking about ?
a very lonely , very frightened 16 @-@ year @-@ old girl
who would mature into someone with whom he was very close
after your mother ...
left you .
victoria .
she has another son .
i imagine you &apos;ll exploit this fresh little morsel
with your usual flair .
you can &apos;t even begin to imagine .
