grace , please .
uh , zach , go to your room for a minute .
i &apos;m working in the kitchen .

nice to meet you , zach .

nice boy .
so , now , did you want starch with any of these ?
ha @-@ ha . what are you doing here , mr. lester , at my home ?
oh , we have a problem .
then call me .
no . this is not something for the telephone .
may i , uh ...
can we do this tomorrow ?
i &apos;m sorry , no .
wow , what a beautiful apartment .
you know , i have no eye at all , but this is beautiful .
thank you . what &apos;s the problem ?
i have it right here .

no , no . i @-@ i have it written down .
i probably should get a smart phone .
my wife says that &apos;s the only way to ... mm .
uh , the bond hearing is at 10 : 30 tomorrow morning .
uh , mr. bishop is at the , um ,
pike street station . is that a &quot; p &quot; ?
lake street station .
oh .
drug arrest ?
why do you ask that ?
why do i ask if it &apos;s a drug arrest ?
because it &apos;s lemond bishop .
well , he has legitimate businesses also .
is this about his legitimate business ?
not really .
then what are we talking about ?
mr. bishop had nothing to do with these murders ,
said family spokesman and lawyer
charles lester .
maybe it &apos;s a different charles lester .
he &apos;s just the spokesman .
it &apos;s not like he actually did it .
&quot; an ex @-@ bishop captain ,
who spoke off the record , said ,
stay out of charles lester &apos;s way and whatever you do ,
don &apos;t give him your name . &quot;
i read your investigative report , marilyn .
all two pages of it .
i told you , eli ,
i could only report on what i could clearly confirm .
you &apos;re hurting peter with these games .
this is not a game , eli . you stonewalled me .
i can &apos;t write a report ...
peter needs you to clear him .
jim moody acted alone . that &apos;s what you heard .
peter never saw this tape until you showed it to him .
we &apos;d like to see an amended report by tomorrow night .
this is not just ...
hello , ms. garbanza .
i &apos;m nelson dubeck with the office of public integrity .
would you mind joining us for a second ?
did you see who &apos;s ...
yep .
they still represent bishop &apos;s legitimate businesses .
we can &apos;t get away from them . we see them more now .
we have to stop sharing clients .
all rise .
uh @-@ oh .
what ?
judge kluger . i have a lunch with him .
okay , we have a ...
probable cause hearing .
mr. bishop , we &apos;ve seen you in here before .
your honor .
and mrs. florrick and mr. gardner ,
ms. lockhart ...
and , um ...
mr. agos .
mr. agos . i &apos;m sorry .
we have a full cast of characters . like a clown car .
and , you , sir ,
uh , you &apos;re a new lawyer here ?
charles lester , your honor .
you step in if one of them dies ?
let &apos;s hope that won &apos;t happen .
no , i &apos;m just , uh ,
mr. bishop &apos;s personal attorney .
and the federal government .
you have no one to hold hands with over there , mr. asher ?
i hold hands with justice , your honor .
i see . how does justice feel about that ?
it was a joke , your honor .
oh , a joke . i see .
well , i &apos;m gonna have to watch out for you , you wag .
let &apos;s dig in . what do you got ?
uh , your honor , it &apos;ll only take a few minutes
to establish probable cause in this case ,
as the evidence is overwhelming .
really ? mrs. florrick .
your honor , according to the dea &apos;s own search warrant ,
it stemmed from a single eyewitness .
and i imagine you &apos;d like to hear from that witness .
we definitely would , your honor .
you have to jump on it . they want to impress bishop ,
win back all his business .
ms. moretti , what were you doing at 4 : 10
in the afternoon on february 26 ?
i was in a condominium unit
across from the bruckman building .
the bruckman building is a residence owned by the defendant , right ?
yes . i sold it to him .
and what did you see from the window ?
well , i was getting ready to show another unit
when i saw three african @-@ american individuals
getting out of a black suv .
was the defendant among them ?
he was . he was standing watch in the alley
while the other two were carrying duffle bags into the back entrance .
i saw one of the bags zipped open ,
and there were white packets inside .
like bricks .
how far away was she ?
cary &apos;s questioning .
and these bricks ,
did they look like drugs to you ?
objection . calls for a conclusion .
it sure does . i will sustain that .
howard lyman , please . it &apos;s will .
are you comfortable ?
reasonably .
you scared me to death .
sorry . the black van tends to intimidate .
we need your help , ms. garbanzo .
ms. garbanza .
my apologies .
we &apos;re looking into your boss , ma &apos;am .
you mean eli gold ?
no .
why ?
voter fraud .
i can &apos;t help you .
yes , you can .
y @-@ you &apos;ll think you can &apos;t
because of your loyalty to peter ...
you mean governor florrick .
but you &apos;ll soon realize you &apos;re vulnerable .
do you want to know why ?
no .
you have no attorney @-@ client privilege .
everybody else is a lawyer . the world is full of lawyers .
you &apos;re the type that goes to jail .
for what ?
conspiracy to defraud the public .
please open the door .
but there &apos;s another reason you &apos;ll talk to me , marilyn .
i said open the door . let me out .
it &apos;s the right thing to do .
what are you doing ?
why ?
what &apos;s the matter ?
well , he &apos;s not the , um ...
brightest .
mr. lyman , as a lockhart / gardner lawyer ,
were you assigned a task on mr. bishop &apos;s case ?
yes .
and could you tell us what that was ?
i could .
what was it ?
i was to assess the property
that mr. bishop was gonna purchase .
and were you assessing properties
on february 26 at 4 : 00 p.m. ?
yes . and a lot of other dates .
but on that date , were you assessing
a property at 1677 south oakley avenue ?
yes .
and is that anywhere near the bruckman building
where ms. moretti claims she saw lemond bishop
unloading white bricks ?
no , it &apos;s , like , 20 miles away .
and who showed you these condos on south oakley ?
ms. moretti .
your honor , the only proof is this man &apos;s opinion ?
actually , if i may continue , your honor .
please .
now , mr. lyman , did you happen to take photos
of the condo at south oakley ?
panoramic photos .
and is this one of your photos ?
yes , it is .
and who is that there in the corner ?
that &apos;s ms. moretti .
we submit the camera and the stamped photos
as evidence , your honor .
okay .
ausa asher , do you and justice have anything to offer ?
i &apos;m sorry , your honor . uh , this is agent cheswick .
he &apos;s not from justice . he &apos;s a dea agent .
i &apos;m referring to your holding hands with justice .
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m sorry , your honor ?
do you guys joke much over there at justice ?
all the time .
good . your friend from dea ,
does he have anything to offer ?
your honor , i think i can clear up a confusion here .
i was just rushing over here after interviewing ms. moretti .
and she apologizes ,
but she made a mistake .
she saw the defendant transporting drugs
a day earlier , on february 25 .
have a seat .
you were just rushing over here ?
you don &apos;t seem very out of breath .
i &apos;m a good runner .
are you ? okay , here &apos;s what i &apos;m gonna do .
i &apos;m gonna free
mr. bishop .
your honor , that &apos;s completely unacceptable .
... walk away ? wait , guys , this isn &apos;t crossfire .
i &apos;m gonna free mr. bishop on $ 100,000 bond .
i &apos;m not dismissing the charges .
we &apos;re gonna go to trial . but i &apos;m gonna
tell you something , guys : you can &apos;t do this .
you tell a story , and you stick to it .
i have a lunch with judge kluger tomorrow .
i didn &apos;t know he was on this case .
i thought you said this lunch was just about a book
he &apos;s writing about lawyers .
it is , but i ...
it doesn &apos;t feel ...
i think i should cancel .
what ?
you don &apos;t want to piss off a judge ,
not one we &apos;re arguing in front of .
mrs. florrick , do you have a minute ?
there &apos;s no way the real estate agent could &apos;ve seen me
moving any product on february 25 .
because you &apos;re innocent ?
no .
i was moving product on february 26 .
so you &apos;re saying they got their facts right ,
but the witness couldn &apos;t have seen it .
yes , she wasn &apos;t there .
and she couldn &apos;t have seen it on february 25
because it wasn &apos;t happening .
you think they don &apos;t want to reveal the reason
they knew about the drugs ?
yes .
a confidential informant ?
didn &apos;t i tell you she was smart ?
yep , that &apos;s what we &apos;re considering .
who ?
well ,
when mr. bishop was here last week , um ,
who was in the meeting ?
no .
we &apos;ve reviewed our memories , mrs. florrick .
we only mentioned mr. bishop &apos;s february 26 location once ,
and that was in the meeting with your firm .
no . it had to have been someone else ,
someone from your crew .
no .
mr. bishop kept his location private .
but he did share it with your firm in case there was trouble .
you were the only ones who knew where he was .
so ...
could you give me those names ?
actually , do you mind taking the stairs
and giving us a minute ?
hi . i don &apos;t think we &apos;ve met .
uh , charles lester .
clarke hayden .
were you in the meeting last week ?
oh , mr. lester , can we talk ?
definitely . and , uh , you must be robyn , right , the bubbly one ?
i don &apos;t know about that .
and what was your last name ?
uh , okay , we &apos;re gonna talk .
excuse me .
i &apos;ll investigate .
if there was a leak ...
and i very much doubt that there was ... then i &apos;m responsible .
okay . that &apos;s good of you .
but charles will work with you .
mr. bishop , this is my firm .
this is my life .
if this goes wrong , you won &apos;t be the one doing 15 in pekin .
i thought you liked working with me , alicia .
did i do something wrong ?
no .
not at all , but after the meeting , did you talk to anyone ?
after the lemond bishop meeting ? no .
i mean , i did talk to people , but not about the meeting .
and did you take notes ?
yes .
where are those ?
in my desk .
i lock my desk .
i am so sorry that i &apos;m late .
i couldn &apos;t find a cab , and i hate to drive .
mr. lester , we were just finishing up .
really ? oh , darn .
well , maybe i can just listen in on the end .
mr. hayden .
hello , sir .
you were just saying that you didn &apos;t tell anyone
about the facts discussed in the bishop meeting ,
and that you didn &apos;t show anyone your notes .
actually , i didn &apos;t say that ... about the notes .
you ... ?
are you sure ?
yes .
so , you showed someone your notes .
no , i locked them in my desk .
i just wanted to be exact .
i hadn &apos;t said it yet .
good . thank you .
so , just a few questions from me .
did you do a cost @-@ benefit analysis of mr. bishop , sir ?
of all the clients , yes . why ?
oh , i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m just nosey .
who did you share this analysis with ?
just the partners here .
no one else ?
no one else .
now , you have a friend from high school
who works for the drug enforcement agency .
howie ?
howard , yes ,
and i can &apos;t find his last name .
i didn &apos;t leak anything .
well , that stands to reason .
when was the time you saw howie ?
2002 .
and what about your father ?
when was the last time you saw him ?
mm , like a month ago .
he reminds me of you , actually .
a handsome devil , eh ?
he wanted to be a lawyer , but
they were kind of the turn on , drop out sorts .
did your dad have a drug arrest ?
oh , yeah , more than one .
he grew pot in our backyard for a while .
so , that &apos;s odd ,
you becoming an investigator for treasury ?
ah , i needed a job . student loans .
and you had lunch with a friend
from treasury just last week .
yeah . how &apos;d you know that ?
i know everything .
but you didn &apos;t tell your friend anything about your work here ?
uh , yeah . he thinks it sounds like a real kick ,
starting up like this .
no . but nothing about client meetings ?
oh , no , no .
that never leaves these walls .
it &apos;s not us , mr. lester .
those are the three most honest people i know .
well , i know a lot of honest people ,
but i don &apos;t always trust them because ...
they talk too much .
no , that &apos;s ... that &apos;s just robyn &apos;s way .
trust me .
the leak is elsewhere .
okay .
now , i &apos;d wanted to clear everyone
before i asked your firm to do this ,
but events are moving too quickly ,
so , i have to ask you to , uh ,
keep this completely to yourself .
we need you to be on call
at 3 : 00 tomorrow .
why ?
well , mr. bishop is delivering something to o &apos;hare .
in case of trouble , i need you on call .
this is not a good time for mr. bishop .
i would urge restraint .
unfortunately , this is a delivery he can &apos;t delay .
just be on call at 3 : 00 .
okay . i ...
oh , god .
what ?
i have to go .
judge kluger , i am so sorry .
oh , alicia . please . it &apos;s no problem .
how are you ?
good .
i &apos;m , uh , so sorry .
i got tied up with a client .
yes , i figured as much .
tied up and gagged to keep you away from me .
um , how &apos;s the book going ?
oh , it &apos;s good . uh , uh , good .
unfortunately , another judge has just called me ,
and @-@ and i &apos;m gonna have to cut this short .
you ... oh , now ?
yes , unfortunately .
it &apos;s a ... it &apos;s an emergency .
okay , um , well , can i ...
can i call and @-@ and let me schedule another time ?
that would be fine , yes .
well , can i walk you ?
oh , no , no ,
uh , because i have to start this on the phone , so , um ...
why don &apos;t you stay and have a drink ?
again , i &apos;m so sorry .
yes , this is kluger .
what &apos;s going on , cary ?
i &apos;m drinking .
is this some kind of punishment ?
no . you asked me for drinks .
i &apos;m drinking .
funny .
you want to get me to talk , you just say talk .
don &apos;t play games .
good evening , marilyn .
eli .
it &apos;s just the two of us today .
peter asked me to take this meeting .
what ?
he &apos;s avoiding me .
no . he has a scheduling conflict .
for our last three meetings ?
it &apos;s been busy .
maybe you haven &apos;t heard .
he &apos;s governor .
you have a great talent for turning friends into enemies .
issue a report supporting the governor .
and i &apos;ll be back in his good graces ?
no .
what is it ?
a video of a stuffed ballot box .
thank you , marilyn .
this is the first step toward clean government .
you really never drive ?
never .
haven &apos;t you seen the statistics on roadway deaths ?
yeah , but the same statistics apply when i &apos;m driving .
true , but that &apos;d be your fault , not my fault .
sir , do you know why i stopped you ?
i have no idea .
you were driving recklessly .
crossed the median a few times .
something funny , sir ?
yes , i find it funny .
do you always conduct routine traffic stops
with dea agents in tow ?
please step out of the car .
sir , we see what appears to be cocaine
in plain view in the rear of your vehicle .
that gives us probable cause to search .
i &apos;m now opening up the trunk of your vehicle .
hello , mr. bishop .
agent .
you want to tell me what this is ?
that &apos;s , uh , pancake batter , sir .
it &apos;s more than 900 grams , that &apos;s 10 to 50 years .
for bisquick ?
take a look at the bottom of the trunk .
robyn , i left you three messages .
please call me back .
has anyone seen robyn ?
mr. hayden , have you seen robyn ?
uh ... there .
robyn , where have you been ?
why aren &apos;t you answering your phone ?
at lunch .
mr. lester said not to take any calls this afternoon .
he ... why ?
mr. bishop was taking something
to the airport at 5 : 00 and might need me .
no , at 3 : 00 .
no , at 7 : 00 .
mr. bishop ,
we &apos;re your lawyers .
you need to trust us , or get new representation ,
but this childish test ...
i was just pulled over on the way to the airport .
we told four people at your office
four different times for mr. bishop &apos;s delivery .
12 : 00 p.m. for mr. agos , 3 : 00 for you ,
5 : 00 for ms. burdine , 7 : 00 for mr. hayden .
don &apos;t you want to know when we were pulled over ?
no .
3 : 00 , mrs. florrick .
your time .
mr. bishop , i didn &apos;t ...
we told you
and only you , that i was dropping something off
at the airport at 3 : 00 .
after you were told this , you met with judge kluger .
to discuss his book at lunch .
did you tell anyone
either in person , or on the phone ?
no !
did you text
or e @-@ mail ?
no , i didn &apos;t . i ...
i ...
yes ?
i left myself a voice mail reminder .
did you ever talk on the phone
about mr. bishop &apos;s
apartment drophouse ?
yes , with cary agos .
we discussed it .
lemond , don &apos;t use the phone !
don &apos;t worry . it &apos;s a burner .
dex , i need you
to drop off some burners at florrick @-@ agos .
we have ... a problem .
the dea is tapping them .
drop everything else and get over there , now .
hey , this is funny .
what ?
they think it &apos;s dea surveillance .
burner phones again ?
you &apos;ve done this before ?
no , when we were
leaving lockhart / gardner .
this is different .
how long do we have to use these ?
we don &apos;t know . the dea
is getting to bishop through us ,
so any business calls ,
use these , and be careful ,
the packaging can cut .
we got to go to court .
get a preservation order .
why ? that won &apos;t help us now .
it will with the judge .
he already thinks they lied about the real estate witness .
so , we &apos;ll show they lied to protect their wiretap .
that was ... almost will @-@ like .
thank you , diane .
be careful what you say .
hello , this is alicia florrick .
wow , that was formal . it &apos;s eli .
i want to talk to you about this voter fraud investigation .
actually , eli , let me call you on another line .
another ... why ?
i &apos;d rather talk to you on another line .
yep , she &apos;s on to us , she &apos;s switching numbers .
who &apos;s she on with ?
eli gold .
right , one of mine .
we can trace it back through his line .
oh , and , uh , i just sent you something .
this isn &apos;t one of those things where the guy jumps up
and scares you ?
no , it &apos;s pets riding a roomba ,
it &apos;s very cute . watch it , it goes fast .
damn it , i hate those .
i got her on eli gold &apos;s line .
hey , alicia , what was wrong with your work line ?
nothing , we &apos;re just having some issues .
have peter call me on this number
when he wants to talk , okay ?
got her burner number , i &apos;m sending it to you .
glad to see you two are working , finally .
what &apos;s up ?
we got a problem with the marwat warrant .
the ...
the one that became the florrick warrant .
oh , right . lawyer .
she &apos;s married to the governor .
right , well ,
she represents a drug dealer named lemond bishop .
they just realized we &apos;re listening .
they what ?
they just realized that we are listening ,
well , actually they think it &apos;s the dea ,
but they &apos;re still changing numbers .
how did they realize ?
we don &apos;t know .
you can get around it ?
the new numbers ? no problem ,
but we &apos;re not sure how we got exposed .
all right . come with me .
let &apos;s go .
it wasn &apos;t our fault .
i didn &apos;t say it was . come on .
i &apos;ve got a translation to do .
it can wait .
okay , what do we have today ?
it has come to our attention ,
your honor , that our phones are being tapped by the dea .
excuse me ?
hold on , frank .
it &apos;s come to your attention how ?
the dea attempted to execute an arrest using information
that only could have been gleaned from our calls .
well , that &apos;s exciting .
frank , is it true ?
is your friend tapping their calls ?
just one second , your honor ?
okay .
what relief are you looking for , mr. agos ?
an order to preserve the wiretaps .
for later discovery ?
yes , your honor , we believe that this ...
this- this real estate witness , i forgot her name ...
oh , i forgot her name . screw her .
we believe , your honor ,
that she lied in order to protect the real reason
for the warrant : the dea &apos;s wiretap .
wow . okay , hey ,
frank , where are we ?
uh , your honor , uh , h- how could we possibly preserve a wiretap
when there isn &apos;t one .
your honor , that &apos;s a lie .
the dea showed their hand ...
to suggest that a u.s. attorney would stand in open court
and knowingly deny the existence of a wiretap is preposterous .
oh , he happens to be right .
if the dea were wiretapping your phones ,
they would have to say so
or they would go to jail .
the prosecution has been lying
since they stepped into this courtroom .
i &apos;m gonna deny the preservation order
because there &apos;s nothing to preserve .
well , then , again , we ask , your honor ,
under these circumstances ,
that this warrant based on supposed testimony be thrown out .
and the charges brought against mr. bishop be dismissed .
all right , i &apos;ll consider the motion ,
and i will return ... with my ruling .
he &apos;s ruling against us .
here &apos;s a difficult decision .
do we tell lockhart / gardner ?
tell them what ?
they &apos;re being tapped .
i mean , if we are , they are .
i didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
i used it exactly the way i said i would .
you endangered an nsa warrant .
the subject knows she &apos;s being surveilled .
look , you were encouraged to
share your intelligence with other departments .
that &apos;s what you did .
in case you didn &apos;t realize ,
there &apos;s still a drug war going on in this country .
and a drug war didn &apos;t bring down the twin towers .
oh , god , do you guys love pulling that out .
this has gone way beyond terrorism and you know it .
i know we can &apos;t do our job
if you keep making mistakes .
tell him .
the target , mrs. florrick , is changing her numbers .
she &apos;s being more cautious .
but about us . the dea .
not you guys .
but i ...
we &apos;re cutting you off .
oh , you can &apos;t do that .
i just did .
no more tidbits about where bishop is picking up his drugs .
do your own homework .
yeah , i would , if we were given the power you have ...
the only explanation that makes sense
is that the dea is tapping our phones .
and they &apos;re probably tapping yours , too .
but they denied it in court .
yeah . and they lied when they put that phony witness on the stand .
well , thank you , cary .
we appreciate you sharing with us .
what do you think ?
i think it would explain
how the dea got their information on bishop .
it could also be a florrick @-@ agos attempt
to undercut our business .
we have to divulge to our clients .
our clients worry about our security .
kalinda , why don &apos;t you find out if cary is telling the truth .
sure .
the , uh , motion to dismiss the warrant is denied .
we are gonna go to trial . any other motions ,
cause of actions , speak now or forever hold your piece .
your honor , i have a request for a substitution of counsel .
you what ?
ausa alvarez will be stepping in .
why wasn &apos;t this done in the probable cause hearing ?
why is this being done now ?
i am resigning , your honor .
you &apos;re recusing yourself .
no , i mean i am resigning from my position as us attorney .
is it something we said ?
your honor , it &apos;s not you .
this is an interoffice matter .
what &apos;s going on ?
i don &apos;t know .
some interagency battle ?
ah , there you are .
we were just leaving .
do i know you ?
no . not yet .
nelson dubeck , with the office of public integrity .
and this is john , ron , and patrick .
um , do we have an appointment ?
no , i &apos;m sorry , we didn &apos;t have time .
so what is this regarding ?
we have a videotape we would like to show you .
you look like you &apos;ve seen this before , mrs. florrick .
really ?
what would i look like if i hadn &apos;t seen it ?
well , in my experience , when a wife sees evidence
that her husband has stolen something , she is ... surprised .
oh , i see .
which one &apos;s my husband ?
this is serious , mrs. florrick .
i would take it seriously .
mr. dubeck ,
my husband has spent every day
of the last four years being investigated .
every single day .
actually , i &apos;m wrong .
there were six months when he wasn &apos;t investigated ,
the six months he was in prison .
you &apos;re not inspiring confidence , mrs. florrick .
the only time my husband didn &apos;t do something wrong
was when he was in prison ?
did i say something amusing ?
i used to be like you ,
certain , deferential to authority ...
is that what i am ?
... thinking everyone being investigated
is obviously guilty .
it &apos;s just a matter of time .
you should be investigated .
it changes you .
you know what &apos;s different this time , mrs. florrick ,
from all the other times your husband has been investigated ?
this time , you were his lawyer .
yep , on election night .
this time ,
you can go to prison yourself .
that &apos;s what will really change you .
are you here to serve a subpoena ?
no , not yet . like i said ,
i &apos;m giving you a chance to get in front of this .
thank you , but no .
i &apos;d get my affairs in order
if i were you , mrs. florrick .
you &apos;ve got kids to think about ,
your new law firm .
eli , where &apos;s peter ?
where are you calling me from , china ?
it &apos;s a bad connection . where &apos;s peter ?
in a meeting . why ? what &apos;s wrong ?
a man from the office of public integrity just left my office .
his name is nelson dubeck .
he has a copy of the video you showed me .
that &apos;s impossible .
the tribune reporter agreed to hold the story .
eli , he showed it to me .
nora , get marilyn now .
i don &apos;t care what she &apos;s doing .
okay .
marilyn gave it to him ?
i don &apos;t know , maybe .
alicia ...
i need to ask you a question .
marilyn was under the impression
that an old friend of yours could hurt peter .
who ?
will .
how ?
he found the video .
he &apos;s the one who told peter the votes were fraudulent .
the feds have nothing unless they have him .
do you have any influence left there ?
no .
you get more on that drug dealer ?
better .
don &apos;t .
what if it &apos;s important ?
then you &apos;ll miss an important call .
why were you giving me the silent treatment ?
i can &apos;t trust you .
why not ?
well , i can &apos;t trust you either .
that &apos;s true .
mutually assured destruction .
are you telling the truth about the wiretap ?
that lockhart / gardner is being wiretapped ? yes .
what are you doing about it ?
buying burner phones .
did you alert clients ?
we talked about it .
but you haven &apos;t yet .
we &apos;re getting our house in order ...
and you should , too .
kalinda ,
i &apos;m telling the truth .
he &apos;s lying .
you &apos;re sure ?
yeah .
will , i just talked to kalinda .
we &apos;re okay .
cary wants us to chase our tails ?
that &apos;s what it looks like .
wow . it &apos;s almost fun to watch .
i think will and diane end up getting it on .
what ? you &apos;re crazy .
listen to them .
that is not sexual attraction .
you need a life .
this is a dossier on the new ausa , theresa alvarez .
texas tech undergrad , northwestern law .
she was in tax fraud before moving
to organized crime .
where was she born ?
mm , i don &apos;t know .
where does she live ?
we don &apos;t need that .
yes , we do .
mr. lester ... we should look
into asher . find out why he resigned .
he &apos;s a law @-@ and @-@ order type , so ...
my guess is when he heard about the wiretaps ,
it didn &apos;t sit well .
a crisis of conscience ?
only one way to find out .
i am not answering that question .
sir , if you &apos;re aware of illegal activity ...
what i &apos;m aware of is that my responsibility to this office
does not end with my departure .
but it ends if someone in the government committed a crime .
hey , how &apos;s tyus ?
excuse me ?
your son , tyus .
he goes to tisch now , right ?
my nephew akiva goes there .
he loves the place .
yeah , tyus is fine .
and your daughter scarlett ,
she plays on that ayso team .
am i right ?
all right .
this is what &apos;s gonna happen , mr. lester .
you &apos;re gonna leave my office ,
or i &apos;m gonna call the marshal
and have you arrested ...
sir , i &apos;m sorry .
i used to work as an investigator for treasury ,
so i get what you &apos;re going through .
sometimes you see something that doesn &apos;t make sense ,
something wrong , and you can &apos;t participate .
but it &apos;s also wrong to pretend it didn &apos;t happen .
no . but nice try using my conscience against me .
lemond bishop is a scumbag
who should be dropped in the deepest hole
in the u.s. penitentiary service .
but this isn &apos;t about him or the dea .
the wiretap isn &apos;t ?
what &apos;s it about ?
if i have a confession to make ,
i &apos;ll make it to my priest .
this isn &apos;t over yet .
mr. asher , the warrant
w ... uh , strike that .
given that , um ... strike that .
did you prepare the warrant
that is the subject of this probable cause hearing ?
that &apos;s the one .
objection . work product , your honor .
mr. asher worked with the prosecution .
yes , until he resigned two days ago .
yes , but he was privy to our trial strategy .
so i won &apos;t ask about trial strategy .
this is about the prosecution perjuring themselves .
in what way ?
we believe there &apos;s an active wiretap .
believe . your honor . this is a fishing expedition .
yeah , but it &apos;s actually pretty specific
for a fishing expedition .
i &apos;m gonna overrule , but ...
be ready for a great monty python @-@ sized boot
coming down on your head , mr. lester ,
if you stray too far afield .
got it , your honor .
the warrant that you prepared for this hearing , was that
based on the sworn affidavit of dea agent lee cheswick ?
yes .
are you aware of any wiretaps that were
in fact the undisclosed basis of this warrant ?
objection . no foundation .
of course there &apos;s no foundation .
if the warrant was fabricated , the foundation &apos;s been concealed .
overruled .
please answer , mr. asher .
mr. asher ? on advice of counsel ,
i refuse to answer on the grounds that
my answer may incriminate me .
well , we have ourselves a ball game .
judge , no adverse inference can be drawn
from mr. asher &apos;s invocation of the fifth .
thank you , counselor . i &apos;m actually familiar with the constitution .
do you have any further thoughts ?
no , your honor .
well , that went better than expected .
robyn , what did you say asher said about the wiretaps ?
the thing about it not being about bishop ?
or the dea , right ?
have you ever heard of parallel construction ?
no .
all right , well ,
this is a reuters article on the nsa .
the nsa ?
yeah .
they &apos;ve been handing tips gleaned from their surveillance
on to other departments , including the dea .
what ?
yeah . so ...
according to this article ,
the dea can &apos;t use classified information to build a case
so it creates a new evidence trail .
like the real estate witness .
yeah .
that &apos;s parallel construction .
wait , so ...
you &apos;re saying that the nsa is surveilling bishop ?
yeah .
or us .
you know we &apos;re trying to fight terrorists here .
i do know that .
it &apos;s a very important job .
you &apos;ve also been asked to assist our investigation .
we already have a leak from this warrant .
not from our department .
the target knows she &apos;s being surveilled .
well , again , that &apos;s not from my department .
what do you have ?
alicia ,
i need to ask you a question .
marilyn was under the impression that an old friend of yours
could hurt peter .
who ?
will .
how ?
he found the video .
he &apos;s the one who told peter the votes were fraudulent .
the feds have nothing unless they have him .
yes .
that is interesting .
all rise .
thank you .
you know , this one is tough because ... thank you ...
on one hand , we have a @-@ a quantity
of cocaine that has been found on the defendant .
your honor , we would disp ...
and on the other ,
we have a witness who doesn &apos;t seem
to know one day from another ,
and a prosecutor who just won &apos;t talk .
judge , if i may ...
you may not .
this is when i talk and this is when you ... listen .
despite ms. alvarez &apos;s admonition ,
the court may and does draw an adverse inference
from mr. asher &apos;s performance .
i find the warrant at issue
to be compromised , and therefore ,
the motion to quash is granted .
you can &apos;t cross the line
and then act like you didn &apos;t cross the line .
then shoot me .
shoot me .
who &apos;s that ?
that &apos;s his girlfriend .
she &apos;s pregnant .
why does he want to kill her ?
she was with his partner .
okay .
i think this will make sense if i get more wine .
kluger .
hi , uh , judge . alicia florrick .
i hope this is a good time .
what can i do for you , mrs. florrick ?
oh , i wanted to reschedule our lunch .
you did ?
yes . uh , to talk about your book .
well , that &apos;s very kind of you .
i &apos;ve decided not to write that book .
see , publishing is a mug &apos;s game .
i &apos;m learning mandarin .
i see .
um , well , we could ...
yes , and i &apos;ve @-@ i &apos;ve mastered a new phrase .
zai jian .
it means good night ?
good ...
what ?
nothing .
i just feel bad for her .
the florrick lady ?
don &apos;t worry , she &apos;ll be all right .
you think so ?
no . i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s none of our business anyway .
thanks for seeing me , mr. gardner .
yeah , i had a feeling it was one of those
speak to me now or speak to me later ? kind of things .
just a few questions .
if any of these questions
touch upon governor florrick
in the time i represented him ,
then i am bound by attorney @-@ client privilege .
you are not bound
if you were asked to protect an ongoing conspiracy .
what ongoing conspiracy ?
the election fraud this video depicts
and the ensuing cover @-@ up you participated in
constitutes an ongoing crime .
now , if you answer my questions ,
i can offer a grant of transactional immunity .
but you have to cooperate fully .
if any of your questions touch upon governor florrick
in the time i represented him ...
i was under the impression
that governor florrick &apos;s wife
stole some of your top clients .
you &apos;ll really do hard time for him ?
if any of your questions
touch upon governor florrick ...
all right .
this is a subpoena .
let &apos;s see how your resolve stands up
in front of a grand jury .
or ...
you can talk to me now .
it was nice meeting you , mr. dubeck .
and you .
see you again very soon .
can &apos;t wait .
