hey , who went for coffee ? nice .
oh , you took forever getting back , so you miss out .
whose is that ?
hughes &apos; .
well , you &apos;ll be glad i took my time ,
because i solved our embezzlement scam .
it &apos;s a lapping scheme .
a lapping scheme ?
it &apos;s a way to siphon money .
i &apos;ll show you .
let &apos;s say i want a sip of hughes &apos; latte .
oh , i -- - just a sip .
wow , that &apos;s delicious .
but now i have a problem .
hughes is gonna toss your butt back into prison
for drinking his coffee .
right , so ...
take a little bit of yours , pour a little bit into here ,
but now you &apos;re gonna kick my butt .
it &apos;s a lapping scheme .
i keep going as long as i can .
in the end , i got a full cup of coffee ,
and no one &apos;s the wiser .
until i catch you .
that &apos;s good work , though -- very good work .
hey , june &apos;s throwing a champagne brunch . i totally forgot .
do you mind if i cut out early ?
what kind of monster would i be
to keep neal caffrey from a champagne brunch ?
see you , guys .
got your message .
i was wondering when you were gonna call .
hop in . we &apos;ll chat .
forgot my suit .
that &apos;s never stopped you before .
relax , i know you &apos;re wearing the anklet .
what i don &apos;t know is if you &apos;re wired .
get in .
where &apos;s the music box , alex ?
no small talk ?
come on . your note said it &apos;s in manhattan .
i want to make sure you &apos;re not gonna go
and get it without me .
i told you . we &apos;ll get it together .
it &apos;s in the italian consulate .
i traced it to the consul general .
he tucked the box
into his private safe in the consulate last year .
he &apos;s flying in next month to pick it up .
a consulate &apos;s a hard target .
they &apos;re having a party next week .
it &apos;s our chance to get inside .
i &apos;m always up for a party .
what happens when he notices it &apos;s gone ?
well , the nazis stole the box from the russians .
he wasn &apos;t supposed to have it in the first place ,
so he won &apos;t talk when we steal it from him .
i got a question .
i know why i &apos;m naked .
why are you ?
a consulate ?
oh , great , an international incident .
look , i don &apos;t want to end my days in some underground prison ,
adopting cockroaches as pets .
we &apos;re not talking about north korea .
it &apos;s the italians , moz .
they do prison just fine . ask galileo .
can we do it without alex ?
no . she won &apos;t tell me which safe it &apos;s in .
she was always a smart girl .
yeah .
all of this is moot , anyhow .
the suit isn &apos;t gonna let you out of your anklet anytime soon .
not peter .
then who ?
fowler .
if he wants me to get him the music box ,
he has to cut my anklet .
he &apos;s manipulated it before .
okay . let &apos;s say he goes for it .
let &apos;s say you get him the box .
then what ?
what do you mean ?
you give fowler the music box ,
and kate comes running into your arms .
you settle down , buy a fixer @-@ upper ,
and then join the p.t.a ?
yeah .
neal , happily ever after isn &apos;t for guys like us .
it is this time . it is .
agent fowler , extension 221 .
one moment .
agent fowler &apos;s office .
tell him i &apos;ve got information on the music box he requested .
who is this ?
he knows .
he can meet me at midnight , tomorrow .
where ?
he &apos;ll know that , too .
too cryptic ?
where you gonna meet him ?
i &apos;ll find a place .
hey , you got a stakeout ?
yep . deviled ham .
well , you &apos;re either gonna torture neal with it
or you &apos;re going alone .
we &apos;ll see .
what &apos;s going on ?
look .
neal &apos;s tracking data . what &apos;s he up to now ?
nothing , yet .
he spent 45 minutes on the corner of
kenmare and lafayette last night .
well , honey , he can walk freely for a two @-@ mile radius , right ?
yeah , but it &apos;s the way he was walking . look .
he stands at every corner around this parking garage
for exactly two minutes .
he walks each street leading away from this point
and then back again .
what do you think he was doing ?
i think he was casing the area --
how many people are around , where there were cameras ,
looking for an escape route in case he needs one .
what is he planning ?
i think he &apos;s gonna steal the music box .
on a street corner ?
working theory .
well , have fun on your stakeout .
i love you .
i love you .
fowler .
oh , you brought a friend .
i &apos;m not wired .
you &apos;ll forgive me if i don &apos;t take your word for it .
he &apos;s clean .
this better be good .
i &apos;m close to the music box .
that supposed to mean something to me ?
well , you flew in from d.c. , so i think it does .
my window to get the box closes in the next week .
i need my tracking anklet off now to make it happen .
you &apos;re not suggesting something illegal , are you , caffrey ?
of course not ,
especially to an upstanding federal agent such as yourself .
you &apos;re pushing it .
i &apos;m gonna push it some more .
i give you the box , kate and i never hear from you again .
that &apos;s my price .
you know , i don &apos;t give a damn what you do , caffrey .
just don &apos;t make it my problem .
neal , what the hell are you doing ?
this is the italian consulate .
it &apos;s not a bank or a museum .
it &apos;s a little piece of a foreign country .
if we had a tank , maybe , or an air force .
we don &apos;t have an air force ,
but the party will get us past the first wall of security
and into the main ballroom .
there &apos;s only one way into the inner sanctum .
it &apos;s through this security door .
this door is our biggest obstacle .
uh , yeah -- there &apos;s no keypads , no biometrics , no lock .
the only way is to get buzzed through by a guard
stationed in the security room .
let me worry about that .
grand .
once i &apos;m through , there &apos;s a long stretch of hallway
monitored by a closed @-@ circuit camera .
when i make it down the hallway ,
i can get into the vault room .
which safe is it , exactly ?
i &apos;ll let you know .
and when i find the safe , all i have to do is crack it .
it &apos;s high @-@ security and torch @-@ resistant .
uh , you &apos;ll need heavy metal
to get through the fire @-@ resistant plate .
details . one thing at a time , moz .
let &apos;s start with party invites .
i &apos;m looking for a man without a plus @-@ one .
i &apos;m leaning towards this gentleman , ignatius barden .
why him ?
he &apos;s a duke .
wouldn &apos;t someone a little less conspicuous do ?
i always wanted to dance with a duke .
all right . you submit your resume yet ?
the catering company received it this morning .
as the proprietor of the greatest cake bakery ,
i fully expect a glowing reference .
of course .
what &apos;s your in ?
i &apos;m planning to make
a very generous donation to the people of italy .
neal , uh , company is on the way .
thank you .
oh , look at this --
all the usual suspects in one place .
makes my job much easier . what are you kids up to ?
we were just leaving .
ah , i bet you were .
i know you met with fowler .
and now alex and your little buddy are here .
you &apos;ve got your whole crew to steal the box .
tell me i &apos;m wrong .
you &apos;re wrong ?
i don &apos;t understand you .
i gave you a shot at a better life .
it &apos;s not the life i want .
okay . well , we all have our weakness .
kate &apos;s yours .
do the right thing , neal .
you &apos;re fooling yourself
if you think kate &apos;s on your side .
surveillance photos from caffrey &apos;s place .
oh , burke showed up ?
yeah . he didn &apos;t look happy .
he pulled caffrey &apos;s tracking data the night we met with him .
he also slipped in a request
asking what i &apos;m up to in new york .
aren &apos;t you clever , agent burke ?
you keeping an eye on his people ?
jones and cruz , &apos; round the clock .
mentor is moving forward , but we might have a problem .
agent burke might try to interfere .
yes , sir .
yeah , i can -- i can take burke out of play ,
as long as you remember our deal --
i get the box , and this is over .
your date went well ?
you &apos;d be amazed the kinds of places
a duke gets you access to .
and i thought you were just using him for a plus @-@ one .
no harm in having a little fun while i &apos;m at it .
your gift to the italians ?
it &apos;s fancelli &apos;s study , &quot; statua di vulcano . &quot;
this is beautiful .
looks like the real thing .
don &apos;t let it fool you .
i won &apos;t .
there &apos;s something we &apos;ve been avoiding .
i think it &apos;s time to talk about it .
all right .
look , i know you and i have a complicated relationship --
i mean this .
if you can &apos;t get it off ,
then none of this will matter , and everything we &apos;re doing --
it &apos;ll happen , all right ?
can i get you a glass of wine ?
okay .
you remember the last time
we were this close to getting the box ?
copenhagen , sneaking into the amalienborg palace ,
hanging out with the royal family .
i have a scar from the jump off the gatehouse .
it healed nicely .
you didn &apos;t visit me in the hospital .
you didn &apos;t visit me in prison .
you burned that bridge in copenhagen .
you cut me out , a ...
we cut each other out .
that &apos;s ...
who we are .
it &apos;s not a game this time .
come on . i know you &apos;re gonna take the box .
i know this is about kate .
alex , look .
don &apos;t lie to me , neal . it &apos;s humiliating for both of us .
this light &apos;s never been off before .
fowler came through ?
i think we &apos;re in play .
i think this caviar will go lovely
with the foie gras and the champagne .
oh , and i want to try and show you the table settings .
i &apos;m looking for elizabeth burke .
i &apos;m elizabeth .
miss burke , we got a tip
that you have contraband on the premises .
what are you talking about ?
just give me a second .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;re aware there are restrictions
on the import of certain foreign foods and spirits .
we &apos;ll need to search everything .
whoa , whoa , wait a minute . what are you doing ?
you need a search warrant for that .
who are you ?
fbi , ma &apos;am .
you &apos;re with the bureau ?
do you know who my husband is ?
i do .
you think your phone &apos;s being tapped ?
i &apos;ve been on the other side enough
to recognize those clicks .
that &apos;s not good . lauren ?
same . and now fowler &apos;s back .
you think there &apos;s a connection ?
hey , el , what &apos;s up ?
honey , i @-@ i need you .
what &apos;s the matter ?
they &apos;re -- they &apos;re tearing apart my office .
who ?
the fbi .
please , please don &apos;t touch that .
el , did ... she say fbi ?
yeah .
please say a command .
traffic .
traffic .
looks like there &apos;s an accident on park and 34th .
honey .
hey , what &apos;s going -- hey , who &apos;s in charge here ?
stay away from my suspect , burke .
your suspect ?
you &apos;re way out of bounds here , fowler .
fowler ? wait .
you &apos;re the man who violated our home ?
all right , honey .
let me talk to him , all right ?
you almost ruined my husband &apos;s career .
you better calm your wife down here , burke .
i &apos;ll calm her down .
i will not calm down .
all right , that is assaulting an agent .
are you kidding me ?
this is absolutely ridiculous !
you &apos;re under arrest .
jesus , fowler , you have got to be kidding me !
you just got yourself a suspension , agent burke .
jones , right ? take his gun and badge .
you got your own guys for that ... sir .
take his gun and badge .
it &apos;s all right , jones .
it was worth it .
honey , come on . el . el .
can we just -- let &apos;s talk about this .
is there really anything to talk about ?
i mean , i &apos;m out on bail and you &apos;re out of a job .
no , it &apos;s just a two @-@ week suspension .
babe , i was arrested ...
i know .
... and handcuffed in front of my clients .
i &apos;ll be lucky if i have a business in two weeks .
you -- and now i have to call and explain
why $ 2,000 worth of caviar
is the property of the u.s. government .
all right , all right , all right , all right .
come here . come here . come here .
god .
come here . come here .
i love you , el .
i am so sorry .
oh , don &apos;t be sorry .
just -- just get him .
what is it ?
i just heard --
don &apos;t .
i didn &apos;t know this would happen , peter .
i didn &apos;t know he &apos;d go after you .
i don &apos;t want your apology .
for the record , you just bought yourself
two weeks &apos; house arrest .
jones told me .
you try leaving the apartment , you &apos;re done for .
so good luck planning your little caper .
hold on . i &apos;m not done with you .
about that house @-@ arrest thing ...
i never thought he &apos;d come after elizabeth .
you have to believe me .
i don &apos;t care what you thought .
you &apos;re helping him destroy everything i &apos;ve worked for ,
everything my wife has worked for .
he took you out so you couldn &apos;t stop me .
i know , and i walked right into it .
well , like you said , we all have our weaknesses .
he &apos;s got mine . he found yours .
when this is over , we take him down ... for good .
look at this .
neal , your light is off .
yeah , but according to jones ,
the monitoring station says i &apos;m at home .
why isn &apos;t it transmitting ?
fowler .
he shut you down so you could steal the box .
how &apos;d he do that ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m almost impressed .
you &apos;re not gonna arrest me ?
i can &apos;t . i don &apos;t have a badge .
all right .
let &apos;s say you pull off this heist .
you really think he &apos;s gonna let you and kate go ?
i need to know if she &apos;s ...
you &apos;d do the same for elizabeth .
after today , i &apos;m not gonna argue that .
i &apos;m gonna beat him .
what are you gonna do ?
fowler took my badge . i &apos;m gonna take his .
he &apos;s aiding you in illegal activity .
i &apos;m just doing my part .
he &apos;ll be watching you and everyone you work with .
i know .
i &apos;ll need help from somebody with fbi access
who fowler can &apos;t link to me ,
somebody i can trust .
you got someone in mind ?
thanks for coming .
you knew i would , boss .
you don &apos;t have to call me that anymore .
how &apos;s , uh ...
christy ?
yeah .
oh , she &apos;s good .
good , good , good . good .
you guys like d.c. ?
mm , different city , same paperwork .
i should have stuck around .
things are probably more interesting with caffrey .
too interesting .
uh @-@ huh . he the reason i &apos;m here ?
diana , what i &apos;m about to ask you to do
is a lot more than paperwork .
i need you to look into an opr agent --
agent garrett fowler .
somehow , he &apos;s manipulating neal &apos;s anklet .
why ?
neal has access to something he wants .
huh . sounds like he hasn &apos;t changed .
no , same old neal .
he still wearing the hat ?
oh , please .
how did it go ?
good .
the consulate accepted your gift ?
i spoke to mr. tomassi , the consulate manager .
fancelli &apos;s study of vulcan is now in the inner sanctum .
how &apos;s the security ?
like we expected .
the outer door opens with a key card .
buzz us through .
mm , what about the inner door ? can we get through ?
i &apos;ll figure out a way .
he invited you to the party ?
he did .
alex ?
she &apos;s the duke &apos;s plus @-@ one . you ?
you &apos;re looking at the new assistant server ... trainee .
if i play my cards right , i get dental in three months .
all right . then we &apos;re ready .
let &apos;s cut it off . you want to do the honors ?
i feel like i should make a toast or something .
we feel free when we escape , even if it be
but from the frying pan into the fire -- eric hoffer .
no sirens .
into the fire .
this is everything i could find on garrett fowler .
not much there --
i &apos;ve put in a request to go after his files .
i &apos;m just waiting on the judge .
we don &apos;t need much . he &apos;s aiding a premeditated robbery .
the anklet is the key .
and you &apos;re sure it &apos;s him ?
fowler &apos;s doctored caffrey &apos;s information in the past ,
and he &apos;s doing it now .
i need to know how .
well , marshals monitor the anklet .
department of justice supersedes their authority .
fowler could override them and get access .
or he &apos;s altering the data remotely .
mm @-@ hmm . you can &apos;t do that from just any internet connection .
he &apos;d need a secure line .
he &apos;s doing it from opr offices .
they have one in new york . that &apos;s where i need to go .
well , nobody gets into that building without federal cl--
federal clearance and an appointment .
they wouldn &apos;t let me within a hundred yards .
but they &apos;d let me .
fowler finds out , and it &apos;s career suicide .
i came here to help you .
thank you .
this music box -- what happens if he gets it ?
i don &apos;t know ... but we need to make sure he doesn &apos;t .
signore tomassi ?
ah . mr. danvary .
please , call me george .
george ,
thank you again for your remarkable donation .
oh , well , i know how important
fancelli &apos;s work is to italian sculpture .
i couldn &apos;t just let it sit around
in my family &apos;s attic , collecting dust .
no , of course not .
the consul general has requested the piece be placed
in perfect view of his office .
fancelli is his favorite artist .
really ? i had no idea .
could i see it ?
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m afraid that won &apos;t be possible .
but rest assured it &apos;s very safe .
okay .
please enjoy your evening .
ketel one on the rocks , please .
i &apos;ll be right back .
oh , i &apos;m so sorry , sir .
excuse me . mi scusi .
nice lift .
thanks . this will get you through the first door .
you clean up nice .
not so bad yourself .
good luck , caffrey .
alex .
which safe is it ?
triple @-@ walled , case @-@ hardened steel .
1943 mckinzie .
couldn &apos;t make this easy for us , could they ?
where &apos;s the fun in that ?
i &apos;ll see you on the inside .
excuse me ! scusi ! pardon !
i &apos;d like to make a toast to our gracious hosts ...
... and to all of you , because this is a very special night --
well , it &apos;s special to me , anyway .
you probably have no idea who i am ,
so i &apos;m going to tell you .
i &apos;m an internationally renowned art thief .
and tonight , i &apos;m here to rob you .
cheers !
signore , signore , it seems one of our gueststs
has had too much to drink .
please continue to enjoy your evening .
champagne , madame ?
no , thank you .
he made that look easy .
our turn .
buzz us through .
tell me why you &apos;re really here .
well , i told you . i &apos;m here to rob you .
i see .
well , now i &apos;m definitely not gonna tell you .
give me your walkie .
lock him in here . come with me .
move everyone into the atrium . no one leaves here .
we check everyone .
yes , sir .
come on , moz .
neal .
where are you ?
the other side of the glass .
unit one clear .
unit two , east stairwell .
unit two , east stairwell .
go .
some of my best work .
neal , hurry up .
my arm &apos;s killing me from holding that drink tray .
shut off the alarm .
the security room -- go .
take your time , why don &apos;t you ?
you &apos;re losing your touch .
let me in .
everything okay ?
we did it , neal .
we &apos;re not out of here yet .
there &apos;s somebody down there .
that &apos;s very touching , guys , but they &apos;re coming !
alex .
alex !
hurry up ! they &apos;re coming !
come on , mozzie .
go around .
there &apos;s an apb out for a man of interest in a slick suit .
apparently he rappelled down the wall of a consulate .
it &apos;ll be fine .
they &apos;re not gonna prosecute for the theft of an item
they weren &apos;t supposed to have in the first place .
an item you don &apos;t seem to have .
well , let &apos;s just say alex had other plans .
should have seen it coming .
any idea where she went ?
she didn &apos;t stick to the plan .
she got out of the consulate a different way .
if alex wants to disappear , she does .
without that box , fowler &apos;s side wins .
i need to know .
what about us ? are we on the same side here ?
you said i earned the right to make my own choices .
you changing your mind ?
fowler &apos;s still out there .
this isn &apos;t over yet .
what do you mean by that ?
i have something in play .
you &apos;re going to burn a hole right through my floor
if you keep that up .
whatever &apos;s bothering you ,
believe me , it &apos;s gonna work out .
how do you know that ?
thank you ... for everything .
oh , you know i don &apos;t believe in goodbye .
neal , you are one in a million .
and don &apos;t you forget it .
didn &apos;t know if i &apos;d ever see you again .
funny . i was thinking the same thing .
but here ... before i change my mind .
you don &apos;t know what this means to me .
i think i do .
i hope kate &apos;s still the same girl
you think she is .
i &apos;m getting that a lot lately .
if you don &apos;t trust her , why &apos;d you bring this back ?
because i don &apos;t want this to be goodbye ...
in case she &apos;s not .
and plus , i figured i don &apos;t need
all the heat this is gonna bring .
i don &apos;t need the same guy who &apos;s been after you
coming after me .
you always made smart decisions .
you should try it sometime .
fowler just left for his coffee break .
i &apos;m about to enter his office .
aim for his laptop , diana , and be careful .
i &apos;ll be out before he can take his first sip of macchiato .
that it ?
i want assurances .
mentor was created for me ?
kate and i made a deal . you both get new identities .
we get the box .
you disappear ...
... legally .
here you go .
what &apos;s so special about that box ?
that &apos;s above my pay grade .
kate &apos;s waiting for you .
time and place are in that folder .
have a nice life , caffrey .
yeah .
can i help you ?
hey . i &apos;m from i.t.
agent fowler requested another security protocol ,
insisted we schedule during his coffee break .
you know how he gets .
yeah .
hurry , hurry , come on .
fowler .
hey , we got a problem .
there was somebody on your computer here .
she said she was from i.t.
what ? did she get anything ?
she downloaded the whole mentor file .
it looks like she got the whole hard drive .
damn it .
a washington @-@ approved disappearing act .
well , technically , i work for opr .
well , technically . that &apos;s just on paper .
with this new identity ,
you can go anywhere , with kate .
and it &apos;s legal .
it &apos;s genius .
no one will be able to find you --
governments , old enemies , old friends .
remember that old chinese curse ?
may you live in interesting times .
these certainly are interesting times .
remember the second half of that curse ?
may you find what you &apos;re looking for .
gonna say goodbye to the suit ?
send me a postcard .
elizabeth .
neal ? what is this ?
i got a friend at the channing museum .
he &apos;s gonna call you today . he owes me a favor .
really ? why ?
to hire burke premiere events
to do their annual masters retrospective .
that &apos;s -- that &apos;s -- that &apos;s impossible to get .
well , you just got it .
why are you doing this ?
just trying to fix what i broke .
there &apos;s something i wanted to ask you .
yeah ?
you and peter --
how &apos;d you know ?
well ...
i think there &apos;s a difference
between loving the idea of someone ...
and actually loving who they really are .
listen , i got to go . thanks for everything .
okay . well , um , i &apos;ll -- i &apos;ll talk to you later .
goodbye , elizabeth .
i &apos;m headed to the garage .
i &apos;ve got everything on mentor . you &apos;re not gonna believe it .
is neal involved ?
heavily . there &apos;s another file , but it &apos;s encrypted .
i &apos;ll see you in a moment .
agent .
you were on my computer .
agent berrigan , d.c. office .
i have a warrant for my investigation on mentor .
why is d.c. looking at my operation ?
opr appropriating resources
for neal caffrey , an art thief , raises questions .
it &apos;s all legitimate .
i know .
and what else did you find ?
encrypted file .
i couldn &apos;t open it .
i &apos;d like it back .
burke .
fowler . what the hell are you doing ?
of course you &apos;re involved in this .
stay where you are .
lower your weapon .
you have no idea what you &apos;re getting into .
lower your weapon .
hey , just stay where you are .
why are you doing this ?
we &apos;re on the same team .
stay where you are .
stay where you are . you &apos;re in way over your head here .
you have no idea what you &apos;re getting involved in .
you don &apos;t want to shoot an agent .
now put your gun down . drop the weapon .
put your gun down !
drop the weapon !
put the gun down now !
drop the weapon ! drop it !
breathe , breathe . breathe , fowler .
how &apos;d you know he was wearing a vest ?
i didn &apos;t .
what the hell is mentor ?
mentor is legit , burke .
caffrey works for us now .
he and kate are deep undercover for opr .
opr doesn &apos;t have deep @-@ cover agents .
you are helping him disappear .
he wants to go .
you met with him again .
neal is gonna disappear . i need to know where he is .
tell me where he is .
why do you care ?
give me the drive .
you want me to upload this to d.c. ,
or do we have something to talk about ?
airstrip by the hudson , hangar four .
neal .
are you here to arrest me ?
i &apos;m still a civilian .
and i know about mentor .
and i know you can walk away , and it &apos;s all legal .
then what are you doing here ?
