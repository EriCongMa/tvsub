i had to take it .
i mean , have you really thought about
what he &apos;s gonna do ? everyone is gonna die --
everyone .
you did the right thing .
i &apos;m gonna go to the police . i have to go to the police .
i &apos;m gonna give it to them .
if i don &apos;t , if he goes through with it --
if he finds you , he might hurt you again .
ju-- i &apos;ll come with you . just ... tell me where you are .
just promise me you &apos;ll come alone .
i promise .
i &apos;m sorry .
where is it ?
you get away from me .
you can &apos;t stop us now .
everything is in place . it &apos;s too late .
you get away from me .
i always thought you were different .
but you &apos;re just like the rest .
you &apos;re selfish .
give it to me .
no .
help ! somebody call an ambulance !
that &apos;s crazy , man . i &apos;m just like , &quot; whoa . &quot;
she just stepped out . she jumped in front of that car .

i told you to get rid of him .
lizzy , i &apos;m not getting rid of him .
your safety is of great concern to me .
yeah , i can handle myself .
i just -- i don &apos;t want him watching me .
what is all this ?
there was an incident this morning in dupont circle .
a woman was struck by a taxi --
carrie ann beck .
maddox beck &apos;s wife ?
yes . the leaders of the front .
well , how is that possible ?
they died trying to bomb bp &apos;s london office
in response to the gulf oil spill .
so the world believes .
in truth , they took their work underground .
personally , i once admired carrie ann .
however , since going underground ,
they &apos;ve become too radical for my blood ,
advocates for a level of destruction
that ... i find chilling .
so who killed her ?
i believe her husband is responsible .
i don &apos;t understand . weren &apos;t they partners ?
didn &apos;t they found the front together ?
yes , but their partnership was a tenuous one .
she was always the more moderate voice ,
only interested in operations
that related directly to the environment .
beck , on the other hand , views himself as a chosen one ,
a messianic figure who sees humanity as a virus
that needs to be eradicated in order to save the planet .
i fear he got rid of his wife
because she was trying to stop him
from implementing a plan to do just that .
these are the last known photographs of maddox beck and his wife .
they &apos;re the founders of the front .
2012 -- firebomb strikes a biotech park in boston ,
conducting genomics research , causing $ 64 million in damage .
2013 -- four staff members were killed and
4人被害 16人入院治疗
16 hospitalized .
ricin was mailed to the fairbanks blm office ,
which manages transatlantic pipeline .
just got off with the m.e.
he &apos;ll have a tox work @-@ up on beck &apos;s wife within the hour .
we can &apos;t assume beck killed her
just because reddington says so .
get to the morgue . i want a cause of death .
her body &apos;s not at the morgue . she &apos;s at city memorial .
labor and delivery .
she was pregnant ?
yeah , 30 weeks .
from what they can tell , the -- the baby &apos;s fine .
and the mother ?
the doctors declared her brain dead .
they put her on life support
until they can safely deliver the -- the child .
most of the injuries were sustained ,
uh , during the accident ,
but she suffered some injuries beforehand , as well --
lacerations to the -- the head and the hands
and , um , defensive bruises on the forearms .
think he beat her ?
i think she was in one hell of a fight .
you say in your notes
she had clay under her fingernails ?
clay ?
from where ? that &apos;s odd , isn &apos;t it ?
the really odd part is that the -- the clay
is 700 years old .
the soil found under the nails of carrie ann beck
dates back to the 14th century .
it &apos;s called raw sienna .
okay , so , what &apos;s it doing there ?
raw sienna was used by painters at the time ,
painters who belonged to what &apos;s known as the sienese school .
the prado in madrid has an exhibit going on right now
featuring paintings from the sienese school .
last week , one of those paintings was stolen .
that &apos;s what she and beck were fighting over , this painting .
maybe they were trying to sell it on the black market ,
fund their operation .
there were 22 paintings at the exhibit .
the one that was stolen had been on loan
from the santa caterina church in pisa ,
and it was , by far , the least valuable .
then why did they steal it ?
♬ his crusade was a search for god ♬

come on !
number 76 .
number 76 !
i &apos;ve been busting my ass !
and now you fire me because i &apos;m not , what , fast enough ? !
i &apos;ll need all your research .
no !
and any leads as to her whereabouts .
you want me to find the girl ? i &apos;ll find the girl .
but these things take time !
you don &apos;t have any leads .
you know what ? i don &apos;t have time !
and yet you &apos;ve had me waiting out there for over 45 minutes !
do you know the vending machine is broken ?
it &apos;s as if you enjoy making people miserable !
i work at the dmv !
if you can &apos;t do this , i need to find someone who can .
everything rests on finding the girl .
i understand , and i &apos;m trying my best .
but you didn &apos;t give me much to go on ,
and i &apos;ve had some --
is something wrong ?
you know what ?
just forget it !
talk to me .
it &apos;s mom .
ohh , glen .
three months ago , she was in the shower ,
noticed this ... lump .
how bad ?
got into her bones .
they bombarded her with chemo .
we &apos;ve tried everything --
the pills and the diets , biofeedback ,
music therapy , the flaxseed diet .
flax seed ?
part of the budwig protocol .
i don &apos;t have time for this .
oh , i &apos;m sorry !
has mom &apos;s illness cramped your busy schedule ? !
every time you can &apos;t deliver , you do this --
these cockamamie stories !
my mother is dying !
yes , and your brother @-@ in @-@ law had legionnaires disease ,
and your house was flooded ,
and i &apos;m still no closer to finding the girl .
get out !
you &apos;re the most gifted tracker i know , glen ,
but your mouth runs like a scalded dog .
i don &apos;t know why you &apos;re mad at me .
you &apos;re the one who came up short .
codes . what kind of codes ?
you mean written on the back of the painting ?
not on the back -- under the paint .
the museum sent us everything they had
on the stolen painting .
when it was acquired last year ,
they ran a series of tests to determine its authenticity .
yeah , they used thermal imaging to do microscopic
and spectroscopic analysis and found this .
what &apos;s it mean ?
museum doesn &apos;t know . i spoke with the curator .
call the national gallery . get lillian sharp in here .
if anyone can make heads or tails of this , she can .
keen -- where is she ?
she had an appointment .
look , when i agreed to do this , i --
it &apos;s just taking longer than i thought .
is he out there ?
yeah . i &apos;m going out back .
this is for last week .
do it one more week , and i &apos;ll pay you double .
i &apos;ll be back in one hour .
it &apos;s a map .
a map to what ?
a bedtime story .
it &apos;s a legend about the apophis strain ,
an ancient plague weaponized in the 14th century ,
by both the byzantines and the ottomans
that was mistakenly released
and believed to be the real origin of the black death .
you &apos;re talking about the bubonic plague .
no -- pneumonic plague ,
which is airborne and far more fatal .
scientists now believe that was the plague
that killed 200 million people ,
one of the largest pandemics in history .
that &apos;s why , to prevent armageddon ,
the sworn enemies agreed to task four priests
to take the strain to the end of the world .
and this map indicates
in which end of the world it &apos;s hidden .
agent cooper ,
you &apos;re not taking this seriously , are you ?
maddox beck is .
he killed his wife to get this map .
these symbols -- trust me . this map is worthless .
thursday . same time ?
keen .
lizzy , i need to see you . there &apos;s been a development .
this map is priceless .
you need to move on this now .
if the apophis strain is out there --
you didn &apos;t tell this to the fbi ?
lillian is paid to embargo certain key details
from your colleagues
if she believes they may be of interest to me .
you sure she can be trusted ?
i could say the same thing about you .
ladies , please .
i &apos;m surprised the two of you haven &apos;t met
at a conference or company retreat .
does the fbi do a christmas party ?
one of the priests sent to guard the strain got sick .
and to protect it , the dying man swallowed it whole ,
taking it to his grave .
we know this because the others survived
and created the map .
and the markings ? what do they mean ?
they &apos;re archetypal alignments .
when you connect them , they create lay lines
linking a network of historically significant sites .
you said the priests were sent to the end of the world .
where ?
well , i said it was the end of the world -- not anymore .
if i &apos;m reading this correctly , the strain is buried here --
in america .
red &apos;s source says the map points
to burial ridge in staten island .
it &apos;s the largest native american burial ground in new york .
we &apos;ve contacted local authorities .
we &apos;re on our way now .
i @-@ i don &apos;t know how to break this to you ,
but , uh , beck beat you there .
what are you talking about ?
new york field office
got called in on a grave robbery .
according to park police ,
our guy , beck , he knew exactly where to look .
the bones contain the dna of the plague .
once he has it , he can replicate it .
that &apos;s why he took the bones .
no , he wanted to take them , but according to park police ,
whoever was buried there was moved .
hundreds of years ago .
i &apos;m sending you an image of what was left in its place .
got it .
we think it &apos;s a marker , some sort of addendum to the map .
it &apos;s cyrillic .
it &apos;s ancient cyrillic . it looks like some sort of equation .
&quot; p &quot; equals 100 .
&quot; o &quot; that sort of looks like a ribbon equals 9 .
those dash symbols in between
denotes that the number to the right
should be multiplied by 1,000 .
it totals 109,120 .
probably a measurement . is there a standard form ?
cubits .
uh , one cubit is half a yard .
109,120 cubits is 54,560 yards .
what ?
i was good at math .
there &apos;s another engraving here . looks like , what , a moon ?
or a sun , which rises in the east .
the strain &apos;s final resting place .
54,560 yards or exactly 31 miles .
hello , aram . agent navabi .
you certainly look radiant .
mr. reddington . um ...
if you &apos;re looking for , uh , a @-@ agent keen --
i &apos;m not . i &apos;m looking for you .
aram , are you there ? what is it ?
what &apos;s 31 miles east of burial ridge ?
纽约
this is the oldest church in the city .
the graves in the church , they &apos;re sacrosanct .
is there another way in here ?
the southeast stairwell , behind the
show me .
you want me to find a girl .
you can &apos;t tell me her name ,
and none of the other people who work for you
were able to find her .
yes .
that &apos;s not much to go on .
it &apos;s not .
out of curiosity , the other people who couldn &apos;t find her ,
this ... girl ... um ...
w @-@ what -- what did you do to them ?
aram , this woman is critical in my war with berlin .
fbi ! don &apos;t move !
you know what i have in here .
you wouldn &apos;t be here if you didn &apos;t .
put it down .
it &apos;s incredible , isn &apos;t it ?
finding america a century before columbus ,
surviving , protecting the secret .
his life had one purpose -- the plague .
you &apos;re not walking out of here .
do you know how contagious this is ?
shoot me , i drop it ,
and then we &apos;re both infected .
i said put it down .
either you let me go , or we both die .
the choice is yours .
you &apos;re just like everybody else .
you &apos;re gonna save your life
at the expense of millions of others .
is that why you killed your wife ?
carrie ann killed herself .
she wasn &apos;t able to go through with it ,
but somebody needs to have the courage
to do what &apos;s necessary .
radio foster . tell him we &apos;re on our way .
ressler !
they have it . it &apos;s gone .
the plague , it &apos;s gone .
call state and local police .
tell them we want lookouts and checkpoints
at every highway leading out of the city .
find maddox beck !
you had him .
he was in possession of the strain .
did you hesitate or not ?
he threatened to release it .
and now a mad man is out there
with the ability to start a pandemic .
enough . if it &apos;s the pneumonic plague ,
there are antibiotics , protocols .
for the strain that exists today ,
not the one that &apos;s 700 years old .
we have to assume that there is no cure
for whatever beck got his hands on .
i said that &apos;s enough .
this is unbelievable .
alert the c.d.c.
tell them that a potential category 5 threat
has just been identified with no cure
and a high probability of exposure .
agent keen .
whatever decision you made , i &apos;m sure it was the right one .
i &apos;ve seen you under pressure in the moment .
thank you .
i mean it .
the way you handle --
take mr. reddington , for example .
he asked me to do one thing , and i freeze up ,
but you &apos;re always able to - - what ?
what ? what are you talking about ?
oh , wait . uh , no , just , um ... you &apos;re solid .
reddington asked you to do -
no , forget that -- bad example .
what did reddington ask you to do ?
200 .
that is the exact number of species
that grows extinct every year .
that is 10,000 times
the natural rate of extinction ,
and one species is responsible .
ours .
the reason that we are making the ultimate sacrifice ...
... is because earth is literally dying .
everybody knows it ,
and no one will do anything about it .
to preserve life on earth ,
we need to become ...
extinct .
sharon .
it &apos;s time .
your wife made it perfectly clear
your daughter has no interest in seeing you .
oh , dear .
the f.b.i. is not in the business
of handling your personal affairs .
the f.b.i. is in the business of my business .
why else would i be in business with the f.b.i. ?
if she is in danger , we will protect her ,
either from berlin or you .
who told you she &apos;s my daughter ?
you have no right to have anything to do with that girl ,
not since the night you abandoned her .
i &apos;m touched .
you just upended your ex @-@ wife &apos;s entire life .
i &apos;m not gonna let you do the same thing to her .
as a rule , i consider jealousy to be a base emotion .
but in this case , it &apos;s quite endearing .
oh , god . i am not jealous .
i assure you , lizzy ,
my quest to find this young woman
will in no way compromise our relationship .
&quot; our relationship &quot; ?
where are we on the case ?
no , no , no .
we &apos;re not doing that .
i understand you lost beck . it must be disheartening .
let me be perfectly clear .
aram is not going to help you find your daughter .
and the guy you have following me --
either you get rid of him , or i will .

unconfirmed reports indicate hundreds
have been infected as a result of the outbreak .
the capitol and the supreme court have been evacuated .
metro police have quarantined a 15 @-@ block area ,
reaching from constitution to pennsylvania avenue .
patient zero has been i.d. &apos; d as sharon mcmanus .
prelim autopsy confirms we are dealing with
a genetically modified strain of pneumonic plague .
modified how ?
we have no idea ,
but it is working at an accelerated rate .
people in the quarantine , none of them look sick yet .
from what the cdc can tell ,
the contagion works in three phases ,
the first of which is incubation .
right now , it is dormant in their immune systems .
it is not airborne yet ,
but that is only going to last for the first few hours .
then what ?
it turns the victim symptomatic , then infectious .
based on what we can tell from the time of death
and the rapid depletion of patient zero &apos;s target cells ,
those healthy @-@ looking people will be dead in nine hours .
how many people are we talking about ?
roughly 2,300 in quarantine , sir .
talk to me about the treatment protocols .
there are none .
in order to understand how the disease was altered ,
to find a cure , we need a sample of the original strain .
and beck has the only one .
full e.r.t. report on patient zero &apos;s effects just came in .
they found this on the victim &apos;s shirt --
hair from a rodent ,
a rat species specifically bred for scientific purposes .
rattus norvegicus .
there are only two licensed suppliers for clinical trials .
and in the last month , they &apos;ve only had one shipment
that didn &apos;t go to a university or research facility .
you got beck &apos;s shipping address .
two storied property in thurmont .
send the biohazard team at quantico .
clear !
i need you to come in .
i found your girl .
number 84 .
the picture you gave me , the one of the girl --
i had it aged up in the system
and marked as an fbi inquiry five weeks ago .
the vending machine is still not working .
then dolly goes in for hair plugs .
she &apos;s the only one in the southwest service center with access ,
so i &apos;m frozen out .
the woman grading the written tests needs to shower .
but this morning , dolly comes back , and guess what .
old dolly got a hit ...
a 97 % match on your girl .
zoe dantonio .
as i said , these things take time .
what the hell is that ?
it &apos;s a new vending machine .
yours is broken .
consider it a bonus .
site &apos;s decontaminated .
the equipment looks like it &apos;s been used recently .
my god .
d.c. was just the beginning .
24 cities . on every continent .
they &apos;re gonna be on planes .
aram , get me the faa .
when an organism is ill ,
it develops antibodies to combat the illness .
nature creates the instruments to eradicate deadly disease .
in this case , the disease is humanity .
we &apos;re the antidotes .
climate change , water shortages ,
a population approaching eight billion ...
we won &apos;t live to see it .
and there will be no one left to remember .
but our sacrifice
will usher in the dawn of a new earth .
sharon began our crusade ,
and now the rest of us must see it through .
to a new day .
to a new day .
cdc quarantined a vehicle found at dulles .
there was an inhaler mask discovered outside of the car .
we won &apos;t have the official results for a few hours ,
but the toxins inside
appear to match those found in beck &apos;s lab .
vehicle &apos;s owner was one ron crocker ,
boarded a plane to panama city two hours ago .
every passenger on that flight will be infected .
we have crocker &apos;s travel profile ?
yeah .
one @-@ way ticket , traveling alone ,
no checked baggage .
ticket purchased within the last eight hours .
can you apply the same criteria to passengers on flights
from dulles to the other target cities ?
every matching profile is a potential follower
infected with the plague .
okay , 31 matches .
of those seven are business travelers
who made last @-@ minute reservations using corporate cards .
are they already in flight ?
all but one -- chris perez .
leaves dulles for toronto within one hour .
probably still in the incubation period .
we can take him down , isolate him before he boards .
you work with aram .
notify the faa of those infected flights .
you get to dulles ,
make sure perez does not get on that flight .
final boarding for flight 428,
service to toronto , please proceed to gate a.
we &apos;ve located four of the suspects .
two land in 45 minutes -- moscow and sao paulo .
get word to the air marshals on board .
have teams on the tarmacs ready to quarantine those planes .
contact the tsa and have them patch us
into the airport security feeds .
we have to assume the passengers are all infected .
quarantine won &apos;t help them , only the cure .
which we don &apos;t have .
follow me , please .
coming through !
make way ! federal agents coming through !
stand aside , please !
coming through here ! federal agents !
he &apos;s not at the gate .
aram , you got eyes ?
looking . looking now .
i &apos;m gonna double back .
okay .
come on .
go back -- there .
that &apos;s him .
there he is .
a black jacket with a gray hoodie , a green shoulder bag .
near gate c @-@ 13 .
what &apos;s going on ?
officer down ! i need a medic !
you can &apos;t come in here .
samar , you &apos;re gonna bleed out ! you &apos;ve got to open this door !
it &apos;s out . i &apos;m infected .
if you come in here , you will be , too .
you &apos;ll be okay .
18 of the flights have been quarantined ,
and the suspects have been arrested .
the others -- diverted with military escorts .
what about the infected ?
liz and samar -- how much time do they have ?
worst @-@ case scenario -- eight hours .
i was able to trace a credit card
tied to the plane tickets beck purchased ,
but he created a vpn .
the computer he used
accessed the internet within a 50 @-@ mile radius of abingdon .
get our people in virginia the coordinates .
have them start a canvass .
and the radius -- narrow it down .
mr. reddington , i @-@ i &apos;m calling about agent keen .
circumstances have changed , aram .
i found what i was looking for .
you have ? i mean , uh , you have .
that &apos;s so -- that &apos;s fantastic .
but , uh , that &apos;s actually -- that &apos;s not why i &apos;m calling .
uh , agent keen , she and agent navabi ,
they &apos;ve been infected .
when ?
just over an hour ago .
where are you on beck ?
he &apos;s somewhere outside abingdon , but i don &apos;t know where .
i &apos;ve searched the public record --
uh , tax bills , power , phone .
it &apos;s like -- it &apos;s like he lives off the grid .
well , there you have it .
have what ?
hello ?
what ?
nothing .
what made you smile ?
nipple guards .
a year ago , i , uh ...
tom and i , we were going to adopt a newborn ,
and we were having a baby shower .
and one of the guests ,
this teacher , she brought nipple guards .
did she know you were adopting ?
uh , exactly , yes , she --
it was like she was reminding me that i wasn &apos;t pregnant .
i was just so pissed . i didn &apos;t even thank her .
god , i wish i could just go back and thank her .
i had it all figured out .
i was gonna have a baby ...
and a husband .
and then he showed up .
you know everyone talks about it , right ?
they don &apos;t want to bring it up with you .
why you ? who is he to you ?
reddington is ...
the bane of my existence .
and yet , here he is , trying to reconnect with his daughter ?
trying to find her ?
and i find myself feeling possessive .
possessive of him ,
jealous of the girl he &apos;s trying to protect .
and if that &apos;s not embarrassing enough ,
that &apos;s exactly how he predicted i &apos;d feel .
you think they &apos;ve delivered that baby yet ?
carrie ann beck &apos;s ?
that &apos;s probably why she backed out , right ?
because of that baby .
and when they find a cure , when we walk out of here ,
it &apos;ll all be because of that baby .
i figured it out .
technically , mr. reddington figured it out ,
but i think i know where beck is .
he &apos;s a radical environmentalist ,
so any electricity would be solar .
we have a 50 @-@ mile search area . that could be dozens of houses .
using grid @-@ tied power .
but people who want to sever ties with the government ,
they would use off @-@ grid systems , which are very uncommon .
how uncommon ?
i could only find one
with the capability to support a compound large enough
for beck and his followers .
um , i should mention --
i &apos;m pretty sure mr. reddington has a head start .
pepper , what &apos;s ...
you two out here playing grab @-@ ass in the woods
just smacks of something biblical .
who the hell are you ?
i &apos;m the snake in the grass .
i was a big fan of yours at one time .
i remember you
in that little , inflatable boat in the north sea ,
going up against that oil platform ,
huge waves tossing you up against the pilings ,
fire hoses and steel oil drums raining down from above .
my god , it gives me goose bumps just thinking about it .
then i had the good fortune
of sharing a cell in a prison outside sochi
with a -- an associate of yours , yevgeny bushkin --
big bear of a man , 150 kilos on an empty belly .
as i remember it , yevgeny went on hunger strike
to protest some oil pipeline
that threatened a vital something @-@ or @-@ other .
you probably remember better than i.
but the point is the old boy
didn &apos;t eat for 74 days .
imagine that .
i wouldn &apos;t have the discipline .
my weakness is sausage and peppers .
but yevgeny ...
he did it .
wasted away like christ on the cross ,
dying for a cause --
your cause .
and i remember thinking that the only men i &apos;ve known
that have people who are willing to die for their cause
are either saints or megalomaniacs .
and you ...
are no saint .
which is why i &apos;m not surprised
to find you and pepper waiting out armageddon
here in eden .
you and i both know
you &apos;re not gonna die for your cause .
put that down .
you dig up a plague ,
hatch a plan to spread it around the world ,
but before you do , you synthesize a cure --
for yourself and your eve .
ironic , isn &apos;t it .
if you were half as dedicated to your cause
as yevgeny was , there would be no vaccine ,
i wouldn &apos;t be here ,
and you and pepper would be free to romp like bunnies
until the convulsing and hemorrhaging started .
you &apos;re wrong .
my actions are about our crimes against the earth .
i &apos;ll be frank , mr. beck ,
because i &apos;m in a bit of a hurry .
i &apos;m not here for you .
i think you know what i &apos;m about to ask for .
what &apos;s he talking about ?
you never told him ?
told me what ?
where is it ?
please . don &apos;t .
never told me what ?
we don &apos;t have much time .
my business is finished here .
i &apos;ll leave the two of you .
i &apos;m sure you have plenty to discuss .
