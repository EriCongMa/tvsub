how would you like to run your own business ?
take control of your financial future .
homie , how much money do we have put aside
in case something happens to you ?

if that flashback you just described is true ,
you can &apos;t afford not to open this franchise .
i &apos;m in .
wow , mom !
you &apos;re gonna open a sandwich store ?
mom , if you &apos;re gonna do this ,
there &apos;s one thing i need to know .
and be honest .

seems like someone forgot
there &apos;s a krusty burger two blocks away .
go ahead , teeny .
show &apos; em what we did to arby &apos;s .
she did the one thing i never could -- feed him .
you &apos;re a cool customer , marge .
and we &apos;ve got your back .
with everything from pre @-@ sliced tomatoes ,
to the homey needlepoint on the walls .
and now , the best part of running your own franchise--
picking your sammy fammy .
you &apos;ll want to avoid that .
your monkey just ate all my turkey .
you want some monkey meat to replace it ?
no .
it &apos;s low @-@ fat .
as you can see , i was just two
需持有使用蛋黄酱枪的相关证件
credits short at southern illinois , and ...
i got to be honest with you , marge .
i need this job bad .
you seem to have had , and lost , a lot of jobs .
it &apos;s a whole new world , marge .
a whole new world .
why , my dad spent
his whole life at one company .
started in the basement mailroom ,
and ended his career jumping out the window from the top floor .
yeah , he was wearing this suit .
corpse suit .
i &apos;m not sure ...
this is going to work out .
oh , i get it .
you won &apos;t hire me because i &apos;m pretty .
that could be a lawsuit .
no lawsuit ! you &apos;re hired !
okay , so i don &apos;t want to do anything
that &apos;ll ruin my manicure .
well , then why do you want this job ?
so i can get manicures .
professor , could you say ,
&quot; welcome to mother hubbard &apos;s sandwich cupboard &quot;
without making any other noises ?
of course i can , my dear child .
welcome to ...
mother hubbard &apos;s ...
uh ... sandwich ...
and now i &apos;m running to the unemployment office .
i &apos;m too nervous to sleep .
i &apos;m sorry i woke you up .
i &apos;m just so anxious about tomorrow .
what if the store fails ?
what if i fail ?
well , you woke up the right man in bed .
i love you , marjorie .
and i &apos;ve had my share of failures , sure .
and sometimes i get pretty nervous .
but thanks for talking it out with me .
i think i can finally get to sleep now .
no ! no , no , no !
it was me that couldn &apos;t get to ...
make love now ?

mrs. boss !
some fat blob wants to see you .
homer !
marge . come on , let &apos;s celebrate !
it &apos;s your first day !
homie , i &apos;m a little worried .
do you know there were no customers between 2 : 00 and 4 : 00 ?
hey , tony roma &apos;s wasn &apos;t built in a day .
but don &apos;t worry , i told everyone about this place ,
and they &apos;re all going to support you .
you do have drone delivery , right ?
i kind of promised that .
we don &apos;t have drone delivery !
you &apos;ll have to find a substitute .
damn it !
what &apos;s wrong ?
mother hubbard central expects you to buy
a lot of stuff from them .
uniforms , fixin &apos;s .
it &apos;s like they don &apos;t care if you make money
as long as they make money .
what kind of corporation does that ?
i &apos;m not trying to be political ,
but i &apos;m the only one you can trust here .
shauna ! i saw that !
i &apos;m going to have to let you go .
oh , so you &apos;re , like , firing me
like in that movie where that girl gets fired ?
i &apos;m sorry .
if i &apos;m fired ,
then he &apos;s quitting !
i am ? !
oh , that &apos;s what holds them up .
what am i going to do ?
i &apos;m down two employees and it &apos;s the afternoon rush .
i need a six @-@ foot party sub .
lots of mayonnaise . and i mean lots .

oh , uh , sorry there , marge .
this is my changing room .
you are working two jobs !
no , these are my real legs .
i &apos;m ... i &apos;m not a well man , marge .
this is so sad .
in his homeland , dad was a nuclear engineer .
oh , i was short @-@ staffed and your father volunteered .
actually , i was wondering if you two might want to lend a hand .
no , no .
you want to make american kids work ?
you &apos;re supposed to be driving me
to a tennis class i said i wanted ,
then i changed my mind and i hate it so much
i &apos;m faking stomachaches to get out of it .
would it kill one of you to wash a bell pepper ?
um , i &apos;m not sure this is the best use of my skills .
i said wash !
and , bart , go work the deep fryer .
well , if i &apos;ll be doing this when i &apos;m 40,
might as well start now .
i &apos;m home .
guys , this is gonna be hard for a while .
but we &apos;ll get through this as a family .
yes , we will .
the simpsons and old uncle gil .

i &apos;ve never said this to you before ,
but i &apos;m saying it now .
i &apos;m going to moe &apos;s .
now i know why you come here so much .
no matter how sad you are inside ,

&quot; yesterday &apos;s what &apos;s @-@ it &quot; ?
why does everyone go to them ?
it &apos;s express , marge .
yeah , with our busy lifestyle , we got to have express .
listen there , midge .
i know how to get you out of your contract .
but i got to warn you ...
you will never work in the fast @-@ food industry again .
go on . please .
so , you see , ms. zengler ,
the mother hubbard &apos;s express across the street
is stealing all our business .
it &apos;s not fair .
if you want fairness , work at a sunglass hut .
this is the sandwich game .
i don &apos;t understand you .
i grew up in the pageant system .
oh . now i completely understand you .
i &apos;m a litigious businessman ,
and i need a coffee to go .
one jumbo joe to go !
get the first @-@ aid kit !
one florence nightingale in a box !
and make it snappy !
i got this .
oh , why do these things happen to innocent victims ?
i was just about to become a million @-@ dollar crotch model !
hey , hey , hey ! it &apos;s not corporate &apos;s fault !
really ?
but the franchise agreement says
mother hubbard inc. would provide
adequate training for all employees ,
which they didn &apos;t .
clause 27c @-@ 3 .
you actually read this thing ?
it was written by two lawyers
who had to keep waking the other one up .
if you &apos;ll just give me back my original investment ,
i &apos;ll take full responsibility for this man &apos;s injuries .
please ... tell me i &apos;m still beautiful !
all right , marge . you &apos;ve got a deal .
well , family , we should be proud .
we took on corporate america and broke even .
hear , hear !
sir ?
i @-@ i think we &apos;ve gone far enough to dispose of the body .
dispose ?
i &apos;ve come here to pitch woo .
