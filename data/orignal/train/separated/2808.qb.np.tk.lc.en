we have our stripper , a &quot; miss crystal chandelier . &quot;

i would never do that .
look , i know what &apos;s going on here .
mark explained it all to me . he said this is what you guys do .
well , if mark said that , then mark &apos;s an idiot .
mark &apos;s a genius .
why ? how ? how is he a genius ?
don &apos;t you see what &apos;s happening ?
instead of hitting on her now , he &apos;s becoming her confidante .
now he &apos;s gonna be the guy she goes to , to complain about you .

l tried taking a dance class today to get ready for this callback tomorrow .
how &apos;d it go ? -knocked over a girl .
good work . can we get back to the mark thing ? what am i gonna do ?

i don &apos;t know , guys .
fine , don &apos;t do anything . sit and talk to us .
meanwhile , she is talking to him about you .
and he &apos;s being mr. joe sensitive .
she &apos;s thinking , &quot; maybe he &apos;s the guy for me because he understands me . &quot;
and before you know it , she &apos;s with him .
and you &apos;ll be all , &quot; oh , man ! &quot;
and he &apos;ll be all , &quot; yes ! &quot;

not exactly like the one in the poem .
what do you mean ?
remember how you said you were really dense about poetry ?
so i &apos;m just an empty vase ?
what ?
so , i don &apos;t read as many important books as you do .
and i don &apos;t write trick poems that aren &apos;t about what they seem .
and i get excited about stupid stuff ...
... iike when my people magazine comes ...
... and the new &quot; hold everything &quot; catalog .
but that doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;m empty . i care about things . friends and family .
you have no right to judge me ! you don &apos;t even know me !
the poem is not about you .
what ?
&quot; the empty vase &quot; is not about you .
my baby preciosa ....
you make me so sad that you would think this .
i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s ....
my friend phoebe said
it &apos;s about all women .
well ...

why is it hard ? we &apos;ve been together for almost a year now .
well , i was with carol for , like , eight years .
and i lost her .
and now , if it &apos;s possible , i think i love you even more .
so it &apos;s hard for me to believe i &apos;m not gonna ...
... well , that someone else isn &apos;t gonna take you away .
let it be me . let it be me !
honey , that &apos;s very sweet .
it just seems to me , though , that if two people love each other ...
