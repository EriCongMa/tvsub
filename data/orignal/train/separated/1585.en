You think I hit my son in the face?
I was trying to give him a spanking
and he ran away from me into a doorjamb.
And, quite frankly, this is all your fault.
You were the chaperone on a seventh grade camping trip
and allowed our sons to spend the night in a tent together,
with out my permission.
Did you quit your job because of me?
I care more about defending you than I do about keeping my job.
You shouldn't,
because we did do something on the camping trip.
I made an inventory.
It's what they call it in AA.
What I'm most ashamed of is that I loved getting high
more that I loved you.
I wish we could adopt Callie.
Dad didn't sign the papers.
He did, but they didn't actually ever get sent.
Because I took them out of the mail and ripped them up.
I can't sign the papers again. I love you.
I don't love you.
I'm your sister.
No you're not,
You're a spoiled little brat.
We can't do this.
Well, I'm not getting adopted.
Quickly, please, in here.
Please, hurry.
OK, everybody back. Let's give them some room.
He was telling me he was
upset about a fight he'd just had with his...
And he just grabbed his chest, like, he couldn't breathe,
and... and... and he started shaking,
I had to help him to the ground.
Is he...
Panic attack.
It wasn't... it wasn't a heart attack?
Nope. Happens all the time.
Really?
The symptoms are pretty similar: chest pain,
shortness of breath, rapid heartbeat...
And you're sure?
I'm pretty sure, yeah. The EKG looks fine.
But we should probably take you in
for some observation, just to be 100 percent certain.
No, no. I'm fine.
No, Robert. You should...
OK, if you think I should.
What's going on?
I mean, he said he signed the papers.
Shouldn't he have to, like, stick to that?
You'd think so, wouldn't ya?
Well, he was clearly upset by the whole thing.
I think... I hope, anyway,
that with a little time and space from the drama of it all,
he'll come to his senses.
You really think that's gonna happen?
I do, actually. This all went down so fast,
and there was so much emotion involved.
He just needs a little room to change his perspective.
He's gonna do the right thing, I know it.
I can't believe he pulled this. He seemed like such a nice guy.
Yeah, well, not everyone is not what they seem.
It's a lesson for all of us.
Hey, Callie... hey.
It's gonna be OK. We're gonna work this out.
You hear me?
OK. OK, listen, why don't
you all go get changed out of your clothes.
Put on something comfortable,
we'll put something out for dinner. OK?
I was looking for you before dinner, but I...
No, I know. I, um... I came out here hoping you...
Yeah, I know, I saw you go so I figured...
Callie...
I...
You know, actually,
I don't think I can handle anymore bad news today, Brandon.
It's not bad news. Not really.
I just don't want you to give up.
I know. I know.
OK. Good night, then.
Night.
Hey, bub.
I just wanted to check up on you.
It's quite a day, huh?
Are you all right?
About all the Callie and Robert stuff?
Yeah.
It's gonna be OK though, right?
Yes, honey... it's gonna be fine.
And thank you for telling me
I know that wasn't easy for you,
and I really appreciate your being honest with me.
Are you gonna tell Connor's dad?
Uh... no, I don't think so.
I don't work at Anchor Beach anymore, so I don't have to,
and I really don't see any reason to upset things any further.
You know, honey,
what you guys did, it wasn't wrong.
It just, it wasn't appropriate on a school trip.
I just don't want you to feel ashamed for...
you know, for being curious.
Ok.
Ok.
She's just devastated, as I'm sure you can understand.
So I was hoping that you... you could talk to your husband.
I know why you're here. I understand completely.
But I'm not sure I agree.
I was with you, I really was.
I knew that Robert and Sophia were getting too
invested in Callie,
and I knew they were gonna get hurt,
but I also knew that they would be fine,
because they only want what's best for Callie.
And then it sort of dawned on me.
They only want what's best for Callie.
Because they love her.
And when she called him her father yesterday,
seeing how he lit up and...
And how devastated he was that he upset her,
he had a panic attack, for God's sake.
I just...
I just think he deserves a chance to get to know her
a little better before all this is decided.
I didn't know you were...
Stef stopped by to talk about...
Yesterday.
Yeah, of course.
All right, look, um....
I feel awful about everything that went down.
Sincerely.
I'm sure you do.
And that's why I'm here.
I'd just like to see you make things right.
That's what I'm trying to do.
No, Robert, I think you need to sign the papers.
Look, um... I just wanna
have some sort of relationship with my daughter.
Well, she doesn't want to have a relationship with you. Not now.
And after that stunt yesterday,
Lena and I are not going to try to persuade her otherwise.
Well, I've been trying to figure out a way to handle this.
I was hoping it would be a little more civil,
but you don't leave me any choice.
You'll be hearing from my lawyers tomorrow.
I'm gonna petition the court for custody.
Damn. Good job.
You ever been to one of your dad's AA meetings?
Like to see him get a chip or something?
Uh, yeah, a couple times. Why?
What's it like?
AA? Kinda weird,
but, you know, my dad was happy I went though.
Why was it weird?
Uh, everyone's sitting around,
talking about all the horrible things they did,
and then everyone else is laughing.
Laughing at them?
No, no, no, more like with them.
Like, they've done worse stuff, so...
What... what's the matter?
You think you got a little drinking problem?
Is this... about Ana?
Nah, I was just curious.
OK. Dude, don't get all wrapped up in...
So do you think it really works? AA?
I think so, yeah. I hope so.
I kinda have to, you know?
All right, man, you're up.
Right.
You know, maybe we should...
Lower it?
Yeah, lower it.
One, two, three and four.
And five, six, seven, eight.
And one, two, three, four.
Five, six and...
That was really good.
It was! Except for the end.
Maybe we could, like, simplify it?
We could, but, I mean, don't you wanna end with a bang?
You know, really impress the judges?
You're gonna get it.
When? The competition's this week!
Maybe I should just give up my solo...
What? No, no. Absolutely not.
It'd be better for the team.
No, it wouldn't! Mariana, when you're on, you're fierce.
Hey, and I know you didn't
make me spend all my free time coaching you
just so you could bail at the last minute.
OK, now come on, let's do that last eight.
You just gotta spot that turn.
OK?
OK.
And five, six, seven, eight.
*Wait for it*
*Wait for it*
*Here it comes*
*Like a cannon sounding*
*But you can't break from the crowd*
*You been to the desire*
*Caught in the crossfire*
*Here it comes*
*You try to outrun the pounding*
*When it stormed in like a cloud*
*It must make you so tired*
*Being caught in the crossfire*
Oh, my God, you guys are so good together!
Come on, walk me out.
So, apparently, we are good together.
At least that's what your sister thinks. What about you?
What are you being so weird about?
Nothing. I just...
I just hope the band doesn't go all Fleetwood Mac.
No Doubt?
I hope Brandon and Lou dating doesn't ruin everything.
Brandon and Lou are dating?
Oh, my God. That makes so much sense.
I was wondering why she kept giving him those bedroom eyes.
Don't worry, I'm sure it's all gonna be fine...
Come on, I gotta get home.
Brandon, stop it.
Why? Why did you have to go over there?
Wait, you think this is my fault?
Are you're kidding me!
You think that Robert decided that he wanted custody of Callie,
simply because he saw me standing on his patio? Seriously?
I'm sure it didn't help,
seeing you standing there all defensive and territorial!
He was already upset. Why couldn't
you just give things a little time to cool down?
You're so impulsive! You can't ever leave well-enough alone.
Well, I'm sorry, Lena, I am who I am.
But I'm not gonna be blamed for
being impulsive by a woman who just quit her job on a whim.
I was trying to defend Jude.
What do you think I was trying to do for Callie?!
And protect Jude from what?
From getting into trouble for the shenanigans in the tent?
Which he actually did!
I love this about you,
how passionate and idealistic you are, Lena,
how you would do anything to protect our kids,
but by trying to protect one, you are hurting all of them.
Excuse me?
We cannot raise this family on one salary.
I'm gonna get another job.
Before the mortgage is due?
What are you doing?
I'm going to sleep on the couch.
No, you're not.
You gonna stop me?
You're not gonna sleep on the couch,
because we have a house full of kids,
and as soon as one of them sees you,
they're all gonna know that something's wrong,
and we're gonna have five
freaked out teenagers and nobody wants that!
So get your ass in bed! Please. Please.
Listen...
What are you doing? What is that?
A wall.
To make sure you don't touch me tonight.
Well, you don't have to worry about that.
I'm sorry.
I know I was being all cranky on
Saturday when you went to that fundraiser thingy.
You totally gave me the silent treatment yesterday.
I did not!
Hayley, I texted you like 50 times...
And I replied. Once.
With a big pile of dookie emoticon... that's not a reply.
OK, OK... I'm sorry.
I was talking to my mom about it and she was all,
"Being there for people you care about is really important."
and I know you care about Callie. I mean, she's like your sister.
And you care about me, right?
Yeah, you know I do...
So you're coming to the dance competition?
My solo's, like, amazing.
Yeah, my whole family is gonna be there.
Your whole family is coming to see me?
Yeah, well, I mean, I guess I am.
Mariana's on the dance team, remember?
Oh. Right.
So I got a very interesting phone call this morning.
It seems one of the big-wigs at Idyllwild
saw you play at some music competition last fall,
and would like to offer you a full ride
to go to their summer music program.
Yeah, I know, it's just one
of the most prestigious programs in the country.
But I...
Brandon, you know how this looks on a college application?
You can basically write your
own ticket to any music school in the country.
No, I know, but my hand... remember?
Right...
I mean,
that competition was before all this happened.
I can't play like that anymore.
OK, I hear you. But if you were gonna give it one more shot,
Idyllwild would be the place to do it.
They got some of the best teachers, experts...
therapists in the world.
But, I...
Just... Will you think about it?
I got a little time before we need to let them know.
All right.
I just want you to know I hear your concerns.
It's not something I take lightly,
and we'll review again at the end of the year, OK?
Anybody have any questions?
I have a question...
You don't have to avoid me, OK. I'm not mad.
You're not? You seemed pretty mad the other day.
Well, I'm over it, OK. It's fine.
You just gotta stop telling your moms everything, OK?
Did your mom really quit her job?
Why, like, because of my dad?
Wow. Is she OK?
I think so.
We're OK?
Yeah.
Did you do the science homework? I didn't get it at all...
Coach Kim wants everyone to read the rules for the competition.
A few years ago we lost because of a technicality
and she's all flipped out that we're gonna, like,
have the wrong barrettes or something and get disqualified so...
Really? Nobody?
What? I like to be informed.
OK. So I've been thinking,
and I think we need to rearrange the orders of the solos.
Wait, the competition is tomorrow, why are we making changes?
I think we have to flip
Mariana's and David's,
so when we end up in formation for the last section,
we make a better inverted triangle.
So I'm still third?
And I'm last?
But the music's really different at that part.
It's still two counts of eight. Can we just try it please?
That was beautiful.
Thank you.
Where is this coming from?
Um... I got offered a scholarship
for this summer program.
Um... Idyllwild, if you've...
Yeah, of course.
Yeah.
That's so cool.
Hungry.
Two-thirds or sixth... That' not... I don't know, bud.
You're going to have to talk to one of your siblings about this,
'cause back in my day, math did not look like that.
Hey. So, I have got good news
and I have some...less good news.
The good news is, I got my job back.
You did?
And the less good news is
I'm going need to sit down with Connor and his dad
and talk about the camping trip.
It's important to Monte, and,
to be honest, it's important to me, too.
There are some things, as a mom, that I can overlook,
but that as an administrator,
I have to deal with, and this is one of them.
But, I'm sure everything's gonna be fine.
I don't want you to worry, ok. I just wanted to let you know.
Ok.
You roll over anymore I'm giving you a dog treat.
I'm sorry, I'm just freaking out about the competition tomorrow.
I know it's stupid, it's just a contest.
No, it's not stupid.
You've been working really hard and it's important to you.
Well, yeah, but it's kind of nothing compared
to what you're going through.
You know what game no one wins?
Let's Rank Our Troubles.
Besides, it's super not fun.
I'm just sorry I have to work
so I'm gonna miss your big win... unless you blow it.
Hey, is Brandon with Lou?
Oh, yeah. Totally. Mat's, like, freaking out about it.
He's almost 100 percent sure they're walking into,
like, a "No Doubt" Situation,
which I totally didn't get until
he told me that Gwen Stefani used to be with that drummer guy...
or wait, which one was it?
Which one has the crazy eyes? Anyway...
We should probably get some sleep.
Yeah, right. Like that's gonna happen.
Jude, why don't you tell Mr. Stevens what you told me,
about what happened in the tent.
So, um, that night, after bed check,
we had some girls come into our tent
and we played some games and stuff.
Then we ending up making out with them and...
And?
Uh, nothing. That's it.
Well, that was exactly what I was afraid of...
Is it? Exactly?
Yeah. It is.
Look, I know you think
I'm some sort of big homophobe or something, but I'm not.
I just want to make sure that
my kid's properly supervised when he's supposed to be.
You're absolutely right, sir. We hear you, loud and clear,
and we are gonna make some changes in the way we...
we chaperone trips like these.
Thank you. I just want Connor to be able to be a kid.
Not grow up so fast.
But he is growing up,
and, maybe you're right about one thing,
he's getting a little old for me to be spanking him, so...
You're still grounded, but that's it. OK?
Well, I think it's safe to
say we all learned a little something here.
Why don't you head back to class.
Well, that's good your Dad's being cool.
I can't believe you told your mom. Again.
I didn't tell...
I can't... I...
I can't be friends with a little bitch
who tells his mom every time something happens.
Oh! You made it!
Like I was gonna miss a chance to see you shine.
Aw, thank you.
I'm really proud of you.
Wow. They're really good.
I know.
Mariana.
Oops, gotta go.
I'll be the one hollering the loudest.
OK, so I've been doing a little recon,
and after seeing what the other teams are doing,
I think we should cut that last solo
and put in that double time section we've been working on.
Wait... you're cutting my solo?
What the hell?
I'm sorry, but it's the weakest one.
No, it's not! And why do we have to cut a solo anyway?
We need a bigger finish if we're gonna win.
And Mariana was a hot mess at practice yesterday.
Yeah, because you changed her placement!
The music was totally different!
I mean, you basically sabotaged her.
I'm sorry, are you accusing me of something?
Yeah, I'm accusing you of being a jerk.
Well, this jerk happens to be team captain,
and since Coach Kim isn't here,
what I say, goes.
If you don't like it, you don't have to dance.
What did you just say?
Come on, Kaitlyn. Tia's like our best dancer.
You don't have to do this.
You heard me.
This is a really important competition for us
and I don't think Mariana is ready.
If you disagree, you don't have to be on the team.
You know what? You're right, I don't. I quit.
Good luck, guys.
Your Honor, we found him, like you wanted.
Uh, we served him papers, like you asked.
Um, he even signed them.
So where are they?
Well, from what I can gather, his daughter destroyed them.
That is true, Your Honor, but it's also true
that I regretted signing them the second I did it.
Look, this whole, horrible mess...
it's made me clear on one thing...
Callie is my daughter and I love her.
And we all...
We believe that Callie belongs with us.
And what do you think, Callie?
Go ahead, tell him.
I think the Adams/Fosters are my family.
And nothing is going to change that.
Well, like all custody issues, this is a tricky one.
Both sides make compelling arguments:
familiarity, in the case of the Adams/Fosters,
versus biology, in the case of the Quinns.
Arguments that, under other circumstances,
would be the definitive winner.
But these are not other circumstances.
So here's what I think we should do...
Let's take the remainder of the 180-day abandonment period
and make sure we're making the most informed decision possible.
Until that time, Callie will remain in her current foster home.
But... I'd also like Callie
to spend one day a week with her father.
Fine.
I'll see Robert once a week...
But I won't see anyone else. I won't go to the house,
I won't see Jill and I won't see Sophia.
You guys, we can't do this without Tia.
Well, I'm not dancing if she is, so...
You guys, it really shouldn't be that hard.
It's really just comparative geometry.
OK, look, ok, we're going from seven people,
an odd formation, to six, an even one.
Anytime we're in three, five, seven
it just becomes two, four, six.
There's never a point person.
So if that's you, you just give up the middle, reset
so you're equidistant from your partner and the midpoint.
OK, Anchor Beach, you're up.
Kaitlyn, we're supposed to share centre...
Come on, Mariana.
Everybody comes up here and talks about
how they hit rock bottom and
then started turning their lives around but not me.
I hit rock bottom,
definitely the time I left my kids
on Christmas day to go get high.
Merry Christmas, kids, Mommy got you some crack.
I mean, who does that?
So, yeah, I hit rock bottom,
stayed there for about a decade,
and then decided I was ready.
So, I think one day at a time,
God willing, things are different now.
God, I hope so.
I just pray that I can do better
for this baby than I did for my twins.
Thank you.
Go away, Sophia.
Please, just listen to me.
No.
I just wanted to apologize.
I don't care, you've ruined my life.
All right? So leave me alone.
I didn't mean to, Callie. OK, I'm sorry.
I am so, so sorry.
Save it, Sophia. OK.
There's nothing that you can say that will make me forgive you.
Don't say that!
If you don't forgive me... I'll kill myself.
Don't be melodramatic.
I mean it.
Just go home. I have work to do.
Oh, my God! You were amazing!
Duh! I know! But thank you.
Oh, be right back.
Don't even talk to me right now.
I stuck my neck out for you and...
...and we qualified.
Yeah. I saw. Congrats.
You're not hearing me. We qualified.
You remember those rules that Kaitlyn was handing out?
You know, the ones you made fun of me for taking?
Well, I actually read those,
and it turns out only one member of the qualifying team
has to be on the competing team at State.
And I qualified. That's why I didn't walk off with you.
OK, so...
So, let's start our own dance team.
If I have to listen to Kaitlyn for one more second,
I'm gonna shoot somebody.
Most likely her.
And I'm way too pretty to go to jail.
I can't believe you. God, you are so sneaky, you know that?
Sometimes I use my powers for good. So you in?
Yes, yeah, abso-freaking-lutely.
Good.
All good?
Oh, yeah.
Ooh, hey, Kaitlyn,
guess what? I quit! Bye!
We got in a fight, and I was upset,
so I wasn't looking when I walked into the street.
I'm so embarrassed...
Well, you need to pay more attention.
Thank God nobody was seriously hurt.
This could have been really terrible
for you and a lot of other people.
All right, I uh...
I gave both the drivers my information,
so, obviously, we're going to pay
for all the damages here, so thank you.
OK, have a good night. Be careful.
And thank you, Callie, for calling us.
It wasn't an accident.
What?
We were having a fight,
and she told me that
if I didn't forgive her she'd kill herself.
I didn't realize it at the time, but she meant it.
She walked into traffic.
You know it wasn't an accident.
Sophia?
Is that... is that true?
Why...? Why would you...
Sometimes I just wanna die.
What?
I don't really think I can do this any more.
Come on. Come on, let's get you home.
See you at home.
So what's gonna happen to her?
Well, Robert said they're gonna get her some help, so...
Oh, thank God.
If any of you is ever feeling like that,
I want you to come talk to us, OK?
And if you don't wanna talk to us,
talk to a sibling, or somebody.
There's always someone who'll understand, OK. You promise?
Yeah.
Hey, bub, I've got a plate for you in the oven.
Thanks.
No, I got this.
So what was it? Wrestling?
Coach was in a mood, made us stay late.
Hayley was pretty upset that you weren't there tonight.
Honestly, I was, too.
It's hot, it's hot...
How was your performance?
She was amazing. And she totally saved the show.
Really? I'm sorry I missed it.
Yeah, me too.
But we're gonna see it when they go to State.
What? You made it?
Looks like it.
Nice!
Hey, how was your solo?
So, I was, uh, thinking about this summer...
And, uh, here's the thing... the band is gonna go on tour.
Yeah, well, good for the band...
Mom...
Brandon, you're 16.
Seventeen. Almost.
OK, almost 17.
Do you really want to spend the summer
between your junior and senior years of high school
playing gigs in dive bars in Albuquerque?
Yes.
Why don't you let us talk about it for a little while,
it's a big decision.
OK, all right, yeah.
As long as you think about it.
Oh, we'll think about it.
Ok.
Are you really serious about this? The tour?
Yeah.
What about the scholarship?
You're not even gonna consider going to Idyllwild?
Are you gonna tell Stef and Lena?
No, and I would appreciate it if you didn't either.
Fine, but your just going to give that up?
Brandon, classical music is... that's like your one true love.
Well, we don't always get to have our one true love, do we?
Is it because of Lou?
Is that why you wanna go on tour?
'Cause you're seeing her, right?
It doesn't hurt, sure.
But, no, that's not why I'm going on tour.
I'm going on tour because I think it would be freaking awesome.
Is Lou why you can't be with me?
No.
It's not?
No, you're the reason why I can't be with you, Callie.
You don't know what you want.
You're just reacting all the time.
And you only ever come to me when things get hard for you,
or when everything is going wrong.
Do I have feelings for you? Of course, I have feeligns for you.
I'm always gonna have feelings for you.
But I don't... I don't trust you.
I didn't mean it in a bad way.
Is there another way to mean it, Brandon?
I'm done.
We're done.
We have to be done.
