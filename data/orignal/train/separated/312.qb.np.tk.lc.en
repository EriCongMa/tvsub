earl , can i borrow your paper ?
i want to check my horoscope
to see if i &apos;ll still be a whore in the future .
all right , who wants to go first ?
ooh , do me . do me . do me .
can we have one night at the diner
that doesn &apos;t end with you yelling that at a woman ?
all right , i &apos;ll go .
&quot; gemini , the twins , &quot;
and they &apos;re both doing fine , so let &apos;s move on .
han , what sign are you ?
i &apos;m guessing the 40 @-@ year @-@ old virgo .
max , you don &apos;t need that paper .
i &apos;ll tell you what &apos;s in your future--
using my name as a reference at chipotle .
you guys really believe in that crap ?
they just tell you what you want to hear .
&quot; you will be rich . you will be famous . &quot;
you &apos;d think i &apos;d buy a newspaper if it said ,
&quot; you will be a 75 @-@ year @-@ old cashier &quot; ?
okay , ready to open ?
never have been , never will be .
let &apos;s do this .
wait .
we have to do our business affirmation .
please , god , don &apos;t let us be murdered in here .
all right , let &apos;s open &apos; em up .
oh , hell no .
max .
hang on . i wasn &apos;t done .
oh , hell no !
oh , she &apos;s yarn @-@ bombing that bike .
it &apos;s whimsical . it &apos;s new .
it &apos;s stupid .
graffiti , i get .
i see , &quot; die , bitch . die , &quot; on a wall ,
i think , &quot; okay , this gentleman wanted to get that off his chest . &quot;
but this yarn @-@ ival is pathetic .
yo , yarnie .
i have a name .
it &apos;s guinevere .
yep , that checks out .
what &apos;s happening over here ?
why are you molesting that poor bike ?
i am beautifying the city
one living , glorious work of art at a time .
and tips are always appreciated .
here &apos;s a tip :
go back to school and learn a trade
before daddy &apos;s money runs out .
well , i never--
worked a day in your life , we know .
you think this is artwork ?
artwork is a garfield mug , sweetheart .
you got garfield in a hammock , saying ,
&quot; i &apos;m not overweight . i &apos;m under @-@ tall , &quot;
i &apos;ll build you a gallery right here .
look , you should move on .
my friend doesn &apos;t want you--
how shall i put this ?
taking a giant knit in front of our shop .
what is the problem ? it is not even your bike .
it &apos;s been chained here for , like , four months .
oh , yeah ?
maybe it is our bike ,
and we use it for deliveries
and to trap nerds .
peace out , ganja beer ,
before i knit you a noose .
max , that was a great idea .
what , that she go back to school ?
i know .
at least a couple night classes , right ?
get around some people .
she &apos;s a lost cause . let &apos;s move on .
i &apos;m talking about us doing deliveries .
why do we never deliver ?
speak for yourself . i &apos;ve delivered .
seriously , max , those delivery services--
eat24 , grubhub-- do big business .
no one wants to go out now .
people are so lazy .
i don &apos;t really feel like it .
seriously , max , all we have to do
is slap a delivery charge on that product ,
and suddenly , a $ 5 cupcake is bringing in more money .
and do you know what more money means ?
no . how would i know that ?
okay , question :
which of these goes better with no pants ?
i don &apos;t know . they &apos;re both timeless ...
as in , there &apos;s no time you should wear those .
you can &apos;t be objective . you &apos;re like a kid in a candy store .
i &apos;ll ask max .
uh , well , the red one kind of matches your rash .
i think we have a winner .
so why are you trying out the fancy mesh tonight ?
well , even though sophie and i are getting back together ,
we wanted to make it special and hold off on the sexual part
of the relationship until tonight .
that is so sweet .
i know .
i haven &apos;t even masturbated
since right before i came in here .
so , chestnut , i was buying some rolling papers at the bodega ,
and i hope this is cool , but i said they were for you .
max , i have good news and bad news .
the bad news is ,
this is the only good news i &apos;ve had in three years .
and the good news is ...
you found yourself a new apartment ?
don &apos;t toy with me , woman .
speak plainly and clearly .
did you find a new apartment ?
close your eyes . i &apos;ll give you a hint .
last time i was told to close my eyes ,
i woke up in a bikini on a garbage barge .
p.s. , closest i ever got to a vacation .
oh , you &apos;re dating a clown ?
please , you know i would have told you
if i was dating someone who had a car .
look , it &apos;s the abandoned bike from in front of the shop .
it was the bike from the front of the shop .
now it looks like a contestant on rupaul &apos;s bike race .
看一群男人每周变装成女人的真人秀
we &apos;re gonna use it to make deliveries .
i already signed us up for three delivery services .
still crazy smart .
waste of time .
amazon &apos;s got drones ,
and we &apos;ve got one gay bike .
i don &apos;t want to do deliveries .
i got this . you bake , i &apos;ll bike .
and while you bike , i &apos;ll get baked .
i &apos;m just gonna knock out these three &quot; delivs &quot;
and i &apos;ll met you at the cupcake shop .
&quot; delivs &quot; ?
you like &quot; delivs &quot; ?
it &apos;s an &quot; abbreve &quot; i made up for &quot; deliveries . &quot;
you like &quot; abbreve &quot; ?
it &apos;s an &quot; ab &quot; i made up for &quot; abbreviation . &quot;
i &apos;m gonna make this short . get out .
hey , everybody .
sophie , what do you think ?
aw , good for you , caroline .
i &apos;ve been saying that you should hop on something
pink and ride it since i met you .
ah , max , i &apos;m so glad you &apos;re alone ,
&apos;cause i need some girl talk .
okay , but the last time i did girl talk ,
i got $ 3 for the first minute
and $ 1 for each additional minute .
no , it &apos;s about oleg .
last night , he was unable to ...
oh , what &apos;s a nice way to say this ?
he couldn &apos;t get his soldier to stand at attention ,
and his penis wouldn &apos;t work either .
well , uh , have you tried buying
a cosmopolitan magazine or something ?
they usually have advice on sex stuff
and how to hate your body .
max ...
you don &apos;t think it could be me , do you ?
no way , sophie . you are hot .
the first time oleg saw you ,
his soldier not only saluted .
it exploded .
you &apos;re right . i am hot .
it &apos;s all him .
remember when i said you didn &apos;t have to do deliveries ?
you &apos;re gonna have to do deliveries ,
&apos;cause i only went two blocks ,
and i &apos;m sweating like shia lebeouf at a dui checkpoint .
曾因酒驾发生车祸 后又拒绝酒侧而被吊销驾照
okay , you deliver . i &apos;ll open the window .
but first , business affirmation .
please , god , don &apos;t let us get pistol @-@ whipped in here .
it &apos;s either that guinevere or spider @-@ man came out .
caroline , can i talk to you about a private matter ,
by which i mean the matter is my privates .
okay , but hurry , oleg .
i &apos;m in the middle of a dream catcher situation ,
and it &apos;s a nightmare .
and why me ?
&apos;cause i trust and respect you
and i feel like you know your way around a limp penis .
maybe .
i talked to my therapist--
roy , you know , down at the starbucks .
he told me it &apos;s all mental .
we didn &apos;t get much further than that .
he spilled a grande mochaccino on his sandals .
you &apos;re probably just scared .
intimacy is so hard for some guys ,
it &apos;s not hard for some guys .
yeah , that &apos;s all over my head .
oh , no , max forgot the order slips .
oleg , i &apos;m sure it &apos;ll all work out .
good luck getting your penne al dente .
again , over my head .
max , what are you doing ?
what are you doing ?
what am i doing ?
well , i think i &apos;m watching you shove
our delivery bike into the back of an uber car .
也提供种种高档车型的车辆预约
well , this is uber @-@ awkward .
come on , come on . in or out .
all right , caroline , this is kmilesh , with a &quot; k . &quot;
he doesn &apos;t go to the airport ,
and he once drove some of maroon 5--
so maroon 3 .
no , stop . caroline .
if you want me to deliver the cupcakes ,
i can &apos;t use the bike , i have to use the car .
why ?
oh , my god , are you pregnant ?
you ask me that every day , and almost every day i say no .
look , i want to tell you , but it &apos;s a secret .
and you can &apos;t tell anybody .
do you seriously think i would ever tell anyone
anything about this life ?
right .
i don &apos;t know how to ride a bike , okay ?
you don &apos;t know how to ride a bike ?
max doesn &apos;t know how to ride a bike ?
damn it , caroline !
max doesn &apos;t know how to ride a bike .
oh , happy day .
i finally have something over her .
there is a god ,
and he &apos;s laughing at her too .
lordy , this is harder to watch
than jim carrey in a drama .
而出演的剧情片则大多褒贬不一
max , are you up ?
what &apos;s that smell ? did you bring home greek food ?
no , that &apos;s me .
that &apos;s how you smell after you ride a bike
all over williamsburg delivering 14 orders of cupcakes ,
and i do not wish to smell like this again ,
so you have to learn how to ride that bike , all right ?
who do you think you are
busting in here smelling like hummus
but having no hummus ?
what is the problem ?
didn &apos;t your mother ever teach you how to ride a bike ?
no , my mother was too busy being the town bike .
well , then i &apos;ll teach you .
nope . never getting on a bike .
it &apos;s one of my three &quot; nevers . &quot;
yes , well , your first &quot; never &quot; was ,
&quot; never having a blonde roommate . &quot;
you are chipping away at me piece by piece , lady .
i &apos;m not going anywhere until you tell me what &apos;s going on .
i &apos;d sit on your bed , but that &apos;s your third &quot; never . &quot;
when i was little , there was this kid , tommy doonan .
nice kid , solid hopscotcher .
used to give me his fruit roll @-@ up at lunch every day .
max , did he give you these fruit roll @-@ ups ,
or did you take them ?
don &apos;t interrupt .
one day , tommy doonan got a new bike .
he was out front with this nice ,
older man who looked just like him .
you mean his dad ?
mm , is that what they call them ?
i assumed it was a predator .
so anyway , i was making fun of him
&apos;cause he seemed happy .
i thought that was our thing .
and he started showing off , doing wheelies and stuff ,
to put me in my place ,
but then he flipped up over the handlebars
and came down hard on his face .
sad ,
but not worth me having baklava pits .
well , wait .
after i stopped laughing
and the man picked him up and hugged him predator @-@ style ,
i saw tommy &apos;s teeth had busted through his cheek .
to put it plainly ,
his mouth was on the outside of his face .
ew , that &apos;s like something out of a horror movie ,
like bike of the living dead or texas bike chain massacre
以及 《 德州电锯杀人狂 texas chainsaw massacre 》
or--well , that &apos;s probably enough .
every time i see a bike , i think of his little face
and his little teeth chomping out the side of it .
he had to eat apples like this ...
max , you are not responsible for that .
yeah , i know ,
and 1 out of the 12 jurors agreed .
thank you , number six .
anyway , it freaked me out , so good night .
no , max .
it is not going to work that way .
you &apos;re learning how to ride a bike .
i &apos;m already on one painful cycle .
i don &apos;t want to get on another one .
max , i have access to tootsie rolls ,
and if you get on a bike , i will give you four .
what am i , a chimp ?
five .
let &apos;s go .
don &apos;t look so smug , chestnut .
you don &apos;t know how to ride a bike either .
come on , max , just out here in the alley .
oh , hell no !
what ?
she &apos;s been back here too .
who ?
guine @-@ queer .
there &apos;s so much yarn @-@ bombing , it &apos;s like craft @-@ ganistan .
max , let it go .
stay focused .
get on the bike .
no .
i don &apos;t want to eat apples
out of the side of my face .
come on . let me teach you .
nope .
want a tootsie ?
you know i do .
i mean , you taught me how to be poor .
eh , you &apos;re getting really good at it .
come on . you know what they say about riding a bike .
it &apos;s like riding a bike . see ?
it &apos;s fun , see ?
you got a real pretty mouth , caroline .
can &apos;t wait to see it on the side of your face .
at least just get on the bike .
you don &apos;t even have to go anywhere yet .
nope .
want a tootsie ?
you know i do .
go .
what is this bar doing here ?
i have no use for a bar that can &apos;t get me drunk .
okay , walk the bike over there
and lean against the car to get your balance .
just check and make sure there &apos;s no one around .
why do you care ?
the only people out here this late
would be rapists , murderers , and freaks ...
you know , your peeps .
what the--
hey , girls .
sophie ?
what are you doing in that car alone ?
oh , a dark alley at 3 : 00 a.m. ?
has money gotten that tight ?
yes , but that &apos;s not why we &apos;re out here .
i &apos;m teaching max how to ride a bike ,
and it &apos;s pretty hard .
oh , yeah , i wish i had that problem .
i &apos;m dancing with a rope in here .
we &apos;re trying some exotic , new locales for our lovemaking .
it &apos;s exotic because this isn &apos;t even our car .
we better hurry before that rabbi comes back .
maybe try barking at it again .
there was some movement earlier .
come on , caroline , teach me how to ride this thing .
i got to get away from temple gross shalom
as fast as possible .
okay , i &apos;m gonna get behind you
and hold on to your seat .
not without three long island iced teas
and one , &quot; your butt looks good in those jeans . &quot;
tootsie ?
yeah .
max , don &apos;t look .
yarn @-@ bombing ?
hey , max .
han ?
i &apos;m just riding my bike to the bike store
to buy more bikes .
is that han or
lance armstrong &apos;s runaway testicle ?
sorry , couldn &apos;t hear you .
i was too busy knowing how to ride a bike .
damn it ! now i got to do this .
you know how quickly society will crumble around us
if han starts feeling like he can freely tease me ?
let &apos;s go !
you sure ?
yep .
making fun of han
is one of my two free sources of entertainment .
the other one is located right above this bar .
okay , i &apos;ll keep my hand on the seat ,
and then when you &apos;re ready , tell me , and i &apos;ll let you go .
okay , but don &apos;t let go until i say so .
okay , let go .
already did .
i &apos;m riding a bike ?
max , look out ! pothole !
there goes my other free source of entertainment .
tootsie ?
yes , obviously !
table ten . pick up , max .
yeah , be right there .
like , you know , in a month .
uh , max , how you doing ?
i heard about your vag @-@ accident .
look , if you need to see a doctor ,
my cousin in florida is a good one ,
but then again , the bumpy bus ride might kill you .
no , no , it &apos;ll be fine , earl .
i &apos;m icing it . i just have to keep it cold .
we &apos;re out of ginger ale .
i think you mean the ginger ale is out of you .
max , let me get that for you .
i feel like it was kind of my fault .
kind of ?
was lincoln &apos;s death
kind of john wilkes booth &apos;s fault ?
pick up , caroline .
how &apos;d it go with sophie ?
were you able to do the thing , you know , the man does
while the woman makes shopping lists in her head ?
shh . come on .
i don &apos;t want anyone to know i can &apos;t get it up .
oleg can &apos;t get it up ?
omg . oleg can &apos;t get it up .
best week ever .
hey , everybody !
what &apos;s up ?
not your boyfriend .
if anyone needs me ,
i &apos;ll be outside riding my bike
with an erection .
oh , no , no , no , no . he didn &apos;t hear it from me .
i only told two people--
max and my manicurist , ming wa .
and you don &apos;t have to worry about her
because she doesn &apos;t care about anything
except loving some guy named long time .
sophie , baby ,
this is hard .
yeah , maybe we better not try to be serious .
i mean , the real truth is ,
i only like you for your penis anyway .
say that again .
what , that i only like you for your penis ?
one more time .
well , what , that i don &apos;t have any real feelings for you ?
that it &apos;s completely sexual
and i only like you for your big , stupid penis ?
i &apos;m back , baby .
sophie , can i see you in the kitchen ?
and we better hurry . i &apos;m making three @-@ minute eggs .
cancel my eggs .
i would &apos;ve so left during that whole conversation ,
but i &apos;m holding a can of dr. pepper between my legs .
what ? he &apos;s a doctor . he &apos;s seen it .
well , i think we &apos;re pretty much even .
your legs are a little sore , and i &apos;ll never have children .
so i guess what i &apos;m saying is thanks .
so you really don &apos;t want to get back on the bike ?
you &apos;re just gonna give up ?
i bet even tommy doonan got back on the bike .
whatever happened to him ?
i caught up with him on facebook .
well , more like really @-@ messed @-@ up @-@ face @-@ book .
he &apos;s happily married .
i bet right now he &apos;s driving his car ,
looking straight ahead ,
and smiling at his wife in the seat next to him .
so that &apos;s it for deliveries ?
oh , you can deliver wherever and whenever you want ,
but there is no way i am ever getting on that bike again .
max , look . guinevere .
oh , hell no !
she yarn @-@ bombed our darn barn !
you two should &apos;ve tipped .
i &apos;m an artist .
eat my stitches , bitches .
that was not whimsical at all .
give me the damn bike .
knit &apos;s about to hit the fan .
max , you &apos;re doing it .
what happened to your fear of bikes ?
