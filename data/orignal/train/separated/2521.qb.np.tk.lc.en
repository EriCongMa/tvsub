three feet , nine inches .
that should do it .
don &apos;t you know what kind of animal we &apos;re dealing with ?
okay , enough theory .
hey , dad . we made popcorn .
out of my reach ?
must ... make ... effort .
mr. simpson , you earned this .
what &apos;s on tv ?
krusty &apos;s getting roasted tonight .
小丑阿壳吐槽会
sometimes the language on these gets a little b @-@ l @-@ u @-@ e.
what ?
if you don &apos;t let us watch , we &apos;ll just go to a house
where some more permissive parents will .
how permissive ?
chief wiggum shows us crime photos at sleepovers .
so this is what a body looks like
after it drops 60 stories .
uh , come on , milhouse , don &apos;t pretend you &apos;re asleep .
this is the world we live in .
hey , krusty , our local deli just named a sandwich after you .
it &apos;s called &quot; the unfunny comedian . &quot;
you will always be remembered
for your countless appearances
on the krusty the clown show
and your one appearance on to catch a predator .
hey , i spent a lifetime making people happy .
yeah-- plastic surgeons and divorce lawyers .
i was just about to say that .
he took my laugh .
screw it , i &apos;m doing it anyway .
plastic surgeons and divorce lawyers .
what a legend . krusty the clown is to comedy
what martin luther king is to comedy .
we &apos;ve seen a lot of top @-@ flight comics tonight ,
but that &apos;s over , because it &apos;s time
to hear from krusty the clown .
welcome , krusty .
i grew up watching you .
oh , uh , sorry .
i threw up watching you .
sarah silverman .
i say this with love , you disrespectful skank .
you &apos;ve had more ... oh .
suddenly , i don &apos;t feel like doing this .
sorry , mini @-@ ha @-@ ha . canceling the bit .
tell the others .
i thought this night would be fun for me and my friends .
i don &apos;t even know these people .
and i guess i don &apos;t have any friends .
my only comfort is the roast is over
and will only be shown four times a day
for the rest of all time .
krusty .
yeah ?
is your nose red
because it &apos;s embarrassed to be seen with you ?
oh , nobody warned me
this roast would treat me the same way
as every roast i &apos;ve seen and laughed at .
特邀嘉宾 电视小丑
... and the husband says , &quot; who paid you a nickel ? &quot;
and the wife says , &quot; everybody . &quot;
oh , sorry , wrong for this audience .
i thought swapper jack &apos;s
was something else .
krusty , sorry about the roast .
they had no right to say those hilarious things .
how could they say i &apos;m past my prime ?
me-- the voice of ovaltine .
krusty , why don &apos;t you talk to your dad ?
he &apos;ll cheer you up . he &apos;s a rabbi .
he must &apos;ve learned something from that giant star scroll
he &apos;s always reading .
kid , does talking to your dad make you feel better ?
well , no , but he &apos;s not a rabbi .
more of a flabbi .
why , you little ...
i &apos;ll show you who &apos;s a flabbi !
no , you &apos;re not a flabbi !
yeah , all muscle .
in minnesota , i &apos;d be a supermodel .
okay , i got it .
so , basically , i came here so you could tell me the truth--
that i &apos;m great .
as the torah says : judgment belongs to god .
the torah also says you can &apos;t eat ham ,
and i &apos;m the spokesman for hamco ham .
this is why i only call you on christmas and easter .
wait , wait , wait . please , dad .
do you even think i &apos;m funny ?
i &apos;m not gonna lie to you , for funny ,
i prefer rabbi rudenstein .
he puts the &quot; ha &quot; in hanukah
and the &quot; levity &quot; in leviticus .
as for you , son , if you want to know
my honest opinion of you , you &apos;ve always been ... eh .
go on .
i &apos;ve always been &quot; eh ... ntertaining &quot; ?
dad ?
show me nose fog .
oh , god , he &apos;s dead .
and he never lived to see me be successful .
a pusten fas hilcht hecher .
&quot; an empty barrel reverberates loudly . &quot;
and today , my heart is that barrel .
even though my father and i had our difficulties ,
he was a great man .
and , well , he always ...
wha ?
look , i &apos;m an entertainer .
so maybe the best way to say how i feel about my dad
is through a song
that someone else wrote that i hired people to sing .
this is for you , dad .
* he fought and fought *
* and fought for jewish rights *
* wisdom sought *
* students taught *
* rabbi krustofsky &apos;s gone . *
yeah , well , it &apos;s just ... well , i thought ...
seriously , it can be really tough to lose your father .
yasher co @-@ ack .
let us all please rise .
homer , get up .
dad , are you okay ?
yeah , yeah , great .
i guess my getting @-@ up days are over .
dad , you &apos;re eating too much .
i &apos;m worried about your health .
i don &apos;t want to lose you .
oh , no .
krusty , i brought some homemade chicken soup .
we used the play @-@ doh maker for the matzo .
uh , thanks , but i don &apos;t really like soup .
but you wear that little spoon around your neck .
you really notice stuff , don &apos;t you ?
yes . and i can tell how hard it was to lose your father .
but at least you were there to share his final thoughts .
no , no , it &apos;s a big thing .
no , that &apos;s what he called me .
it could be worse .
oh , yeah ? how ?
i don &apos;t know ,
how about--
that &apos;s a lot worse .
can you stop comforting me now ?
krusty , condolences on your loss .
so this is the bob
whose comedic genius i can never live up to .
believe me , all of us have thought about killing him .
clowns have it tough , krusty .
i understand . i was professor pickles
with ringling brothers for several years .
the elephant and i had our differences .
so , what brings you here ?
and don &apos;t say clown car .
i &apos;m a sad , tragic clown .
like what &apos;s his name-- liberace .
tell me about your father , huh ?
herschel , did you read your exodus ?
oh , uh , oh , sure .
really ? then tell me , what did the burning bush say ?
it said &quot; ow ! put me out !
how many talking bushes do you think there are ? ! &quot;
my son , you are a big needy nothing
that only laughs can fill .
i don &apos;t need laughs .
oh , thank you . thank you .
a big needy nothing .
krusty , would you like a therapy dog ?
yeah . with extra relish !
hey @-@ hey ! i still got it , huh ?
yes , if by &quot; it &quot; you mean reflexive denial of your inner sadness .
shut up , children .
boys and girls , you know
that we &apos;ve been dark for a couple of days
because of a tragic loss in the krustylu family .
now put your hands together
for the man who &apos;s falling apart before our eyes .
krusty the clown !
no monologue . roll the cartoon .
oh , my god !
who made this monstrosity ?
i did everything !
kids , i &apos;m experiencing a crisis of conscience .
no , no , no , no !
i don &apos;t deserve the prerecorded applause of children long gone .
i like ike !
therefore , i &apos;m quitting the show .
and i know mel will be quitting it with me .
yes , yes , buy the house . it &apos;ll be--
what ? !
today is the day the pity laughter died .
krusty the clown has retired .
for a brief overview of a half @-@ century of ha @-@ has ,
here is channel six tv critic clive meriwether .
krusty the clown will perhaps best be remembered
for taking up two spots in the channel six parking lot .
右侧 小丑阿壳车位
on a personal level , he used to call me little lord tingaling .
i shan &apos;t miss that .
this man &apos;s only lasting legacies are a law in his name
limiting the working hours of chimpanzees to 14 hours a day
and the invention of the payment of alimony
by dropping hot pennies from a helicopter .
i give his life a d @-@ plus .
good day to you .
what will krusty do now ?
i suppose only time will tell .
which is true for all news stories , i guess .
until anyone realizes ,
i &apos;m kent brockman adding no useful information .
and here &apos;s another sentence .
you can tell i &apos;m winding it up
because my voice is going up and down like this .
well , at least now i have plenty of time
to solve this rubik &apos;s cube .
all right , what if i did ...
mom , dad .
yes , lisa ?
what ?
i &apos;ve been listening , and dad stops breathing
for as long as five minutes .
mind if i sleep with you guys and keep an eye on him ?
sweetie , you shouldn &apos;t have to worry about such things .
the doctor gave us this machine
to help him breathe in his sleep . go to bed .
i &apos;ll take care of him .
no good . no good .
what do i do ? what do i do ?
oh . breathe , homie , breathe .
well , at least teeny &apos;s doing okay .
he &apos;s in the odd couple with david hyde pierce .
now , really , oscar , would it kill you to use a coaster ?
if you &apos;re going to go up there , at least dust !
finally , done the way i first imagined it .
i &apos;m gonna prove you did groundbreaking work .
krusty , i want you to binge @-@ watch
all the shows you &apos;ve ever done .
well , i &apos;ve never said no to a binge .
deuteronomy ?
isn &apos;t that the study of deuters ?
hippocampus ?
isn &apos;t that another name for the university of mississippi ?
okay . i &apos;ve been on 50 years .
you &apos;re bound to repeat yourself a little .
unless i wanted to be sat on by mama cass .
unless i wanted to be sat on by dom deluise .
... by the cast of what &apos;s happening !
... william &quot; the refrigerator &quot; perry , everyone !
... newman from seinfeld .
... the whale from whale rider .
... adele !
what ? she &apos;s a guest star ? !
so that &apos;s why all my cameramen have ptsd .
where &apos;s my whiskey funnel ? !
young man , you should go .
when the master is like this , it is no place for children .
pour , helga !
it begins .
whoa . where am i ?
why , you &apos;re in jewish heaven .
oh , this place is great .
why , my necktie straightens itself .
even portnoy has no complaints .
and i tell you , i get so much respect .
wow . so i made it to heaven .
整家店就是投诉部门
&#91; 第一个美国主要政党中出现的犹太人副总统候选人 &#93;
this place is amazing !
schmuck , there &apos;s no jewish heaven .
our faith teaches us that once you &apos;re dead ,
that &apos;s it , kaput . it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s cold .
it &apos;s like that apartment we lived in
before i started doing weddings .
but you , my son , remain ...
go back to earth .
do something with your life . help people .
help people . help people . help people .
nothing . i &apos;m not getting a pulse .
i got to change my life !
still no pulse .
i guess i &apos;m just really bad at this .
* someone to watch *
* over me *
i &apos;m afraid lisa &apos;s getting obsessed
with keeping her father out of danger .
she &apos;s gotten our resusci annie doll to breathe on its own .
why ?
in this new shelter , we provide a home
for animals put out of work by cirque du soleil .
um , krusty ,
have you fulfilled the promise you made to your father
in the dream you never told anyone about ?
no .
somehow a brief act of uncharacteristic generosity solved nothing .
hey , krusty .
what ?
have you been going to temple ?
yeah , and i &apos;ve learned that all religions are equally boring .
but there &apos;s a reason i went .
come and see .
kid , there &apos;s no way you can cheer me up .
not when whiskey , good deeds and hookers failed .
who &apos;s a hooker ?
with me , it &apos;s easier to say which ones aren &apos;t hookers .
lisa , what are you doing ?
wrapping you in bubble wrap .
i can &apos;t always be around to protect you , so it will .
but ...
oh , lisa , honey ,
you can &apos;t insulate yourself from life .
why , i could live till 100 or a bus could hit me tomorrow .
that &apos;s why i never plan more than four seconds ahead .
i guess you &apos;re right .
now come on . give daddy a hug .
bubble wrap !
your daughterly love saved me , sweetie .
that &apos;s all i wanted , a tiny bit of control .
ooh . i suppose we should exchange insurance information .
i don &apos;t have any .
me neither .
then we have the same company .
they &apos;ll work it all out .
rabbi rudenstein .
your father &apos;s favorite .
today &apos;s reading is from deuteronomy ,
which i believe is the study of deuters .
hey , that &apos;s my joke .
eh , must be a coincidence .
uh , but before we begin ,
i &apos;d like to quote the burning bush , which said ,
&quot; hey , put me out .
how many talking bushes do you think there are ? &quot;
me again .
so if dad loved his jokes , then ...
dad loved my jokes .
yeah , i guess he just hated your delivery .
he loved my jokes .
my father respected me but could never tell me .
that &apos;s jewish heaven .
* heaven *
* jewish heaven *
* we &apos;re a father and a son who didn &apos;t speak *
* but up here we found the happiness we seek *
* and i can &apos;t wait till you join me next week *
* you *
just this once ,
you think you could turn water into a bloody mary ?
i &apos;ll tell you , you &apos;re all right , you know ?
krusty , let &apos;s face it , you might not be cutting @-@ edge anymore ,
but your show still does really great in that key demo
of people who died with the tv on .
of course , krusty &apos;s responsible
for itchy &amp; scratchy ,
which is also what he calls his testicles .
