第六季 第十一集
400 , 500 , 600,
700 , 800 , 900 , 1,000 .
that &apos;s $ 5,000 .
the bank bag . where &apos;s the bank bag ?
sign here .
are you the one going to prison ?
no .
then what the hell you doing ?
good .
pay for the hotel room , room service
and my dry cleaning .
six hours of consultation ,
which starts now .
you can go .
i was staying .
no , you weren &apos;t staying .
no women .
i &apos;ll call you .
yeah , he &apos;ll call you .
like his first day of school .
dad , dad !
calm down . we &apos;re on our way .
so , four years ?
yeah .
two with good behavior .
you go for three weeks to statesville first .
it &apos;s a maximum security prison .
that &apos;s where d.o.c. will classify you
either as minimum , medium or maximum .
well , i &apos;ll end up in minimum , right ?
maybe . there &apos;s overcrowding these days .
so some minimum inmates end up in maximum .
you need to prepare for maximum .
you &apos;ve done time ?
a week in county .
a week where @-@ where guys are waiting
for their mommies to bail them out ?
prison is different .
half the inmates are never going home .
now , tell me , mr. agos .
do you think guys like that are gonna hesitate to beat
the crap out of you for looking at them the wrong way ?
look , you don &apos;t need to scare me straight . i get it .
i just need tips on what to do .
sure . you want a tip ?
i got one .
here , put it on .
&apos;cause if you don &apos;t start paying attention ,
your cellies are gonna make you their prom queen .
okay .
no . not okay .
shut and listen .
what are you gonna do to protect yourself , mr. agos ?
any family or friends doing time ?
no .
no one who can vouch for you on the inside ?
no .
that &apos;s your tip .
okay ? find a friend .
a white guy .
there &apos;s no such thing as a post @-@ racial lockup .
someone jumps off on your block , you got to run with your own .
because if something happens to you ,
white defends white
and black defends black .
got it ?
i got it .
good . now , let &apos;s find you a white friend .
yeah ?
kalinda , i need your help .
i &apos;m on my way to you .
no .
the prison consultant is advising me to find a convict inside .
someone i can trust .
in statesville ?
yeah .
and one other thing . he &apos;s suggesting it be someone caucasian .
right . i get it .
anyone in mind ?
i &apos;ll call you back , okay ?
is that your girlfriend ?
yeah .
but it &apos;s complicated .
you &apos;re gonna want to uncomplicate that today .
i &apos;m serious .
this isn &apos;t about me .
this is about cary .
a lot of things about cary
end up being about you , kalinda .
i know , but , uh ,
he needs help in statesville .
for the first three weeks , someone to watch his back .
kalinda , last time we stood right here ,
you threatened me .
eh , my mistake .
even worse than threatening me ,
you threatened my son .
i &apos;m sorry , sir .
but that had nothing to do with cary .
you know , he has never wavered once in his support for you , sir .
all he asks is that you help him find someone on the inside .
that &apos;s all .
someone , uh ... white .
you &apos;re gonna get a call in a few hours .
or a few days .
i need you to take it .
from ?
someone .
you &apos;re asking for a favor , kalinda .
i &apos;m asking for one in return .
you want cary to have a friend ?
say yes .
yeah .
hello ?
yeah , this is ray .
who &apos;s the guy coming in ?
cary agos .
oh , yeah . he &apos;s the lawyer caught with trey wagner .
yes .
with the export train ?
yes , that &apos;s right .
when &apos;s his self @-@ surrender date ?
uh , his sentencing is at 5 : 00 today ...
sorry , what @-@ what did you just say ?
that &apos;ll get him here by 8 : 00 a.m. the next day .
i can meet his transport .
yeah , no , you said something about trey &apos;s export train .
the $ 1.3 million in heroin .
you mean &quot; import , &quot; right ?
no , trey and his buddies were trying to get into their own business .
selling to someone in toronto .
cary was accused of conspiring with bishop &apos;s crew
to get the drugs into the city .
but he couldn &apos;t have .
why ? what do you mean ?
because the drugs were already here .
who said that ?
someone who was arrested with trey wagner .
he said the drugs were being readied for export ,
but cary was charged with giving advice on
how to import drugs , not export them .
yes , to be guilty of conspiracy ,
cary &apos;s advice had to have been followed .
and it wasn &apos;t . he &apos;s innocent .
look , is this enough to get him off ?
i don &apos;t think so .
but we could get his plea withdrawn .
where are you , kalinda ?
i &apos;m coming to you .
no , uh , go to the courthouse .
i will petition for time with judge cuesta .
and i &apos;ll meet you there .
okay . i &apos;ll meet you there , too .
no , alicia , judge cuesta doesn &apos;t like you .
you stay where you are .
no , what are you talking about ? meet who where ?
look , i can &apos;t not be involved .
i know , and i &apos;ll call you . just sit tight .
alicia , you have a debate tomorrow .
if you don &apos;t prep for it , you will lose it .
it &apos;s that simple .
okay , i , uh , i got three journalists and one moderator .
and i acted really mad about the standing , so we got it .
we got standing !
yeah , they think alicia wants to sit .
i just need to call cary .
no , you don &apos;t . you need to debate .
oh , adrian . how are you ?
i &apos;m good , mr. gold .
it &apos;s unfortunate we &apos;re inside today .
it &apos;s so beautiful outside .
yeah . alicia ,
this is dr. adrien fluke ,
professor of renaissance literature at the university of chicago .
he &apos;ll be playing frank prady today .
yes , in middle english .
&quot; his heed was balled , that shoon as any glas ,
and eek his face ... &quot;
no . but thanks .
johnny ?
we need to have a word with alicia .
would you give us a second , adrien ?
sure .
you are down by two points .
that &apos;s within the margin of error .
yes , but you &apos;ve settled there .
we &apos;ve let the prady team think
that you &apos;re going into this sedate and soft .
that &apos;s why during the debate negotiations we asked
that you be seated .
it &apos;s a less aggressive stance .
and we &apos;ve also leaked some campaign memos
arguing that voters don &apos;t want
to see a woman be aggressive .
all to catch them with their pants down .
but this only works if you use the debate
to take the fight to them .
i just need a second .
take her phone .
what ?
take her cell phone .
hide it .
dad , i &apos;m the body woman .
i &apos;m not gonna take her ...
you work for this campaign .
when she hangs up , take her cell phone !
some inmate rolls up on you ...
stand up .
okay , keep your distance .
okay ? don &apos;t square up .
that &apos;s aggression . you &apos;re gonna provoke .
so , bring it down a notch ?
yes !
deescalate .
and the best way to do that is to get him to say yes .
you ever spend time around a toddler ?
like , &quot; no , no , no , no ! &quot;
it &apos;s the same thing with these cons .
some gangster wants something that belongs to you ,
get him saying yes ,
and watch the resistance just fall away .
okay , first question .
let &apos;s start with the personal-- alicia ?
your law partner recently
pleaded guilty to a drug charge .
mr. prady ,
do you have a question for alicia about this ?
i do .
what you need for state &apos;s attorney is
someone who upholds the moral authority of their office .
someone who does not have a compromised law partner .
and someone who fights
for the law @-@ abiding citizen .
now , do you really think that you &apos;re that person ?
mrs. florrick ?
yes ?
do you have a response
for mr. prady &apos;s question ?
oh , i thought he was still busy making a statement .
no snark . come on !
well , here &apos;s the thing .
um , cary &apos;s innocent .
my law partner , he didn &apos;t do it .
mm @-@ hmm . why &apos;d he plead guilty ?
mr. moderator , can he just interrupt like that ?
that &apos;s a romney move . don &apos;t referee .
you &apos;ve got to get her in the game .
i &apos;m her body woman ,
not her fluffer .
when did you become so crass ?
no , but it is a pertinent question--
if he &apos;s innocent , why did he plead guilty ?
i didn &apos;t think i was debating two people today .
but , um ...
well , it &apos;s important to remember that sometimes
innocent people plead guilty .
they ...
alicia ?
we &apos;re taking five ...
diane ?
how &apos;s it going ?
we &apos;re meeting with cuesta in a minute .
kalinda got an affidavit from toronto .
that &apos;s great news .
we may need peter &apos;s help
if this doesn &apos;t work .
i know , i &apos;m ready to call him .
all right , wait .
uh , that &apos;s somebody on my other line now .
i &apos;ll call you back .
hello ?
hello , diane , this is eli .
eli , i don &apos;t have time right now .
oh , yes , you do .
i need you to stop taking alicia &apos;s calls .
we &apos;re trying to prepare her for the debate of her life
and all she &apos;s thinking about is cary .
well , then tell her to stop calling me .
diane , listen to me .
alicia can make a difference for cary
and any other cary that comes along , but only if she wins .
all right , i &apos;ll see what i can do , i got to go .
isn &apos;t this case over , counselor ?
i &apos;m afraid not , your honor .
my client would like to file a motion to withdraw his plea .
oh , come on .
we have new evidence that shows the prosecution charged my client
with a crime they knew he did not commit .
your honor , this is not gym class .
there are no do @-@ overs .
what evidence ?
an affidavit from canadian authorities that show
that the drugs at issue in this case were part
of a toronto @-@ based drug operation .
okay , am i supposed to be impressed ?
the toronto detectives noted that the shipment arrived
in chicago on may 11 , two full weeks
before my client allegedly gave his damning advice .
your honor , the prosecution has charged my client
with conspiring to import $ 1.3 million worth
of heroin into the country .
that charge is inconsistent with what in fact occurred .
but your client pled to those facts .
yes , because he was being framed .
framed by who ?
ait a minute , wait a minute .
counselor , where is the evidence
that the prosecution knew about this ?
because the only way i &apos;m rescinding the plea
is if you can show that the prosecution withheld exculpatory evidence .
but , your honor , my client pled ...
i don &apos;t care what he pled to .
i only care if he pled
because the prosecution lied .
now , do you have proof that the prosecution knew
that the drugs arrived on may 11 ?
no .
well , then there &apos;s nothing i can do .
we only ask for our day in court .
and you can have it .
if you can show proof of a brady violation
and bring it to me before the sentencing hearing at 5 : 00 p.m.
that &apos;s not much time .
six hours . we &apos;ve had worse .
we have been given a task .
probably the most important task we will face
this year or any year .
two days ago , cary agos accepted
a plea bargain on drug charges ,
and will spend four years in prison unless ...
unless we can find a brady violation
in the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s work .
we have six ... five hours and 36 minutes
before cary is taken into custody .
kalinda .
okay , so the drugs at issue
in this case were imported two weeks
before cary allegedly committed conspiracy .
and the canadian authorities knew this .
that &apos;s the exculpatory evidence you think they buried ?
yes , but any buried evidence will do .
all right , so we &apos;ll break up into groups .
carey zepps , your team will focus on discovery .
evidence boxes are here .
check to see if the sa &apos;s office had any involvement
with border agents , homeland security , anything .
and , brian , you do the same
with the chicago pd .
uh , someone should also contact mexican authorities .
see if they knew anything about the shipment .
kalinda ?
uh , no , i &apos;m gonna stay with the canadian side .
i have friends up there .
uh , okay .
let &apos;s regroup in two hours for a progress report .
remember , cary is counting on us .
kalinda .
cary called me .
should we tell him ?
he &apos;ll want to know what we have .
i know .
but we have nothing .
and cary &apos;s preparing to go to prison tomorrow .
we should let him prepare .
i think you &apos;re right , okay .
this time it &apos;s alicia . wait .
hi , alicia .
cuesta needs a brady violation ,
or he won &apos;t vacate the plea .
we have until 5 : 00 .
uh , no , alicia , listen to me .
uh , no .
diane , i can leave right now .
no , we have everybody on this ,
we don &apos;t need you .
and , alicia , i need you to stop calling me .
what ?
uh , yeah , i don &apos;t mean to be rude , but we need to focus here .
um , i &apos;ll call you at 5 : 00 after the sentencing . good @-@ bye .
good , can we continue ?
i &apos;ll hold that for you .
do you want some milk ?
no . what ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t like milk .
why not ? it &apos;s good for you .
let &apos;s go , let &apos;s do it .
so , what &apos;s this about , ma &apos;am ?
you &apos;re with the ontario division ,
is that right , inspector ?
it is-- &quot; o &quot; division , narcotics .
and you were tracking the shipment of heroin coming in from chicago ?
yes , ma &apos;am , we were following a gang out of rexdale .
and you believed their heroin
was being transported through chicago ?
yes , but when i reached out to detective prima ...
uh , wait a minute .
excuse me , inspector , but did you say you contacted ...
detective prima ?
yes , i ... i e @-@ mailed him
an official request for information . why ?
do you still have that e @-@ mail , inspector ?
yes . certainly .
can you send it to me ?
yes , if i knew what this was about .
the chicago police believe that $ 1.3 million in heroin
was being imported into the states ,
but you wrote to them that it was being exported
into ontario , correct ?
yes .
and what did detective prima say ? excuse me .
well , i don &apos;t mind saying i @-@ i , uh , was a little disappointed
he didn &apos;t have the courtesy to , uh , respond .
diane ... we need to subpoena prima now .
you found the brady violation ?
yeah .
anyone you trust out here ?
uh ... yeah .
who ? family ?
no .
sounds like my life .
girlfriend ? friend ? wife ?
a friend and a girlfriend .
who &apos;s the friend ?
alicia .
the girl that was here , right ?
right .
give her your power of attorney .
everything you need done , everything you need sent .
do not trust the girlfriend .
things change when you go inside .
go ahead , call her .
call alicia .
one of the reasons i &apos;m running ,
if not the prime reason ,
is that i saw how a marauding state &apos;s attorney
ruins people &apos;s lives .
not just the life of my partner ,
but the lives of widows and orphans , whose loved ones
have been murdered in the recent gun violence .
do you have a response to that , mr. prady ?
my ... response to ... - uh , to what alicia just said
about the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office .
what the hell ?
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry , that was totally inappropriate
on @-@ on my part .
she just looked so serious staring at me .
uh ... what do i think of the ,
uh , state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office ?
i ...
i just ...
okay , well , this was a ... great idea .
mr. fluke , what are you doing ?
dr. fluke .
thank you very much , okay ? and nothing .
i &apos;m not doing anything . i &apos;m fine .
he &apos;s high .
high ? no , i &apos;m not high .
i ... i &apos;m pleasant .
okay , we need a new sparring partner .
come on , guys , this is medical marijuana
for my glaucoma , okay ?
i &apos;m functioning here , i really am .
you need to get laid .
you got to start creating memories now .
what &apos;s your girlfriend &apos;s name ?
kalinda .
give me your phone .
you &apos;re going two to four years without a moment f affection or comfort ,
oso give me the phone .
maybe that &apos;s her .
hi , alicia .
no . why ?
what ?
where are we on overturning the plea ?
i can &apos;t ahold of diane .
what do you mean ?
your plea . the brady violation .
it , um ... okay , uh , l ...
let me call you back .
your honor , we would like to subpoena the backup drives
of the cpd &apos;s fourth district .
this is completely unnecessary , your honor--
detective prima stated on the record
he never received an e @-@ mail from toronto .
then he shouldn &apos;t mind us taking a look at the backup .
you know you only have four hours left , counselor ?
i do , your honor . it &apos;s very dramatic .
objection !
the defense is trying
to manipulate your affection for the dramatic ,
your honor .
i know she is ,
madam asa .
and yet , i do love the dramatic .
subpoena approved . and if i were you ,
ms. lockhart , i would race out of this court right now .
thank you , your honor .
oh , we &apos;re in .
that &apos;s cpd &apos;s server .
okay , good . now , can you access
the individual e @-@ mail archives ?
i can access anything , kalinda .
good , &apos; cause i need positive proof
that he received this e @-@ mail .
nope , he did not .
what ?
he didn &apos;t receive that e @-@ mail .
you know that already ?
i do . there .
wait . couldn &apos;t it have been deleted ?
ah ... that &apos;s the question , isn &apos;t it ?
howell .
yeah , time for the metadata .
you delete an e @-@ mail , it &apos;s still gonna show up in the metadata .
metadata don &apos;t lie .
are you the girlfriend ?
uh , who is this ?
it &apos;s the damn tooth fairy . are you his girlfriend ?
is this the bishop call ?
it &apos;s the prison consultant .
your boy &apos;s throwing up in the bathroom .
if i were you , i &apos;d get your ass down here and do your job .
my job ? what &apos;s my job ?
it &apos;s your boyfriend &apos;s last four hours of freedom .
you need to screw his brains out .
look , i &apos;m a little bit busy right now , okay ?
he &apos;s going away for four years . four years .
what else do you have to do that &apos;s more important than that ?
okay , almost there .
i &apos;m getting him a hooker .
you don &apos;t get down here ,
i &apos;m getting on the phone with five hookers i know .
&apos;cause he &apos;s a nice kid , and he deserves a memory .
yeah , look , i &apos;ll get back to you , all right ?
okay , here we go . metadata .
and wear something sexy .
what ?
uh , bad news .
i went to his spam folder , and he has it set up
to automatically delete at the end of every week .
well , couldn &apos;t he have read it first ?
nah . the metadata says he never opened it .
sorry , k. it &apos;s a dead end .
good . you came to your senses .
okay , i approve .
all right , i &apos;m gonna leave you two alone for a minute .
not too long . we got work to do .
treat me like an adult and tell me everything !
it was a hail mary pass ,
and you needed to focus on getting ready for prison .
i don &apos;t care how far @-@ fetched it is , kalinda .
if there &apos;s even the slightest chance of me beating ...
there isn &apos;t .
what do you mean ?
alicia said that there was ...
we were trying to find a brady violation .
and there isn &apos;t one .
i &apos;m sorry , cary .
okay .
hey , i got to live in hope for an hour .
that &apos;s something , i guess .
less talking , more sex .
so , eli , is there anything in particular
you want me to focus on ?
just one thing .
bury her .
bury her ?
don &apos;t let up . go for the jugular .
just like you would if it were a real debate .
okay .
character . character is the central issue in this campaign .
the s.a. must be above ethical reproach ,
and that is where my opponent falters .
excuse me , but i ...
the company that we keep matters .
mrs. florrick has represented the biggest drug dealer in chicago .
she has represented the wife @-@ killer , colin sweeney .
governor florrick , we &apos;re all acquainted
with governor florrick &apos;s record .
as a candidate for this office ,
mr. prady should understand the importance
of judging people on their own merits ,
instead of engaging in guilt by association .
the cynicism is beneath him .
better .
so that was a memory .
hey . again ?
sure .
i won &apos;t disappear on you .
four years is a long time .
two years with good behavior .
i &apos;ll be here .
good .
so ... rotated the tires ?
how hard would it be
to fake the metadata of prima &apos;s account ?
what do you mean , kalinda ?
how hard would it be to make it look
like he read the e @-@ mail from canada ?
you know that &apos;s illegal , right ?
yes , but i &apos;m asking hypothetically .
it wouldn &apos;t be that hard . but , kalinda , you hack someone ,
you pray there are no cops waiting on the other end .
this is all cops ?
kalinda . anything ?
not yet .
but i &apos;m working on something .
let me know as soon as you can .
we &apos;ve only got two hours .
okay , look , uh , here &apos;s the thing .
you show me , in theory , how one would do it .
then you leave .
you don &apos;t contact me , i don &apos;t contact you .
and if this gets more serious ...
you tell the truth : i asked you how to hack into an account .
but you had nothing to do with it .
kalinda .
i love you .
i &apos;ll do what you ask .
but you can get in some real trouble with this .
i know .
show me .
like this .
always like this .
it &apos;s not because someone &apos;s gonna steal your food .
it &apos;s because someone might slip
a piece of glass into it .
now eat .
i &apos;m not hungry .
three squares a day . food &apos;s lousy ,
but you got to keep your strength up .
look , you got a misconception about all this .
from oz and shawshank .
where you &apos;re going , it &apos;s not like that .
you &apos;re gonna be fine . your first few months
and your last few months are the hardest .
anyone ever ask you about taking off ?
yeah .
what do you tell &apos; em ?
problematic .
why ?
where do you go ?
two years goes faster than you think .
it &apos;s four years .
you ever been to spain ?
they have extradition .
look , you do what you want ,
but you &apos;re not built to be an outlaw .
my whole life , i wanted to be one thing .
a lawyer .
and i had it .
i had it . i had it figured out .
get to the top , take the cases i wanted ,
help the people i wanted .
now ...
i can &apos;t ...
can &apos;t figure anything out .
look at me .
don &apos;t do it .
so it can &apos;t be used to investigate you ,
your husband , or your partners .
now , that , that is the height of cynicism .
let &apos;s talk cynicism .
the cynicism of a lifelong republican
switching parties in advance of his candidacy .
mr. governor .
hi . sorry . hi .
i had an hour . i thought i &apos;d take a peek .
you can &apos;t stay away .
i &apos;ll just sit over here , out of the way .
this is what i would do .
scroll back up .
that shows the e @-@ mail went directly to the detective &apos;s spam folder .
now , that shows that it was deleted unread .
if one were to do this ,
that &apos;s what one would change .
now correct the date ,
move it out of spam ,
and change it to &quot; read . &quot;
easy . now you have to do it here .
make it match .
congrats .
he officially read the e @-@ mail the day he got it .
um , do you have a minute ?
yeah . one sec .
yeah , i &apos;ll talk to you , k.
thanks .
um , i think i found something .
i was thinking back over our interview with prima .
he kept saying &quot; we . &quot;
&quot; we never heard the name inspector frazier . &quot; who &apos;s &quot; we &quot; ?
well , he means the force , the police .
i don &apos;t think so .
check this out . this is a transcript of prima &apos;s interrogation
of trey wagner , when they got him to wear the wire .
now , it &apos;s just prima and trey , but it &apos;s weird .
read that .
&quot; i &apos;m going to see what i can do to help you , trey ,
but you gotta help me , too . &quot;
&quot; i don &apos;t know anything . &quot;
&quot; shut up ... you lying piece of crap . &quot;
you see ? it &apos;s like good cop / bad cop ,
only he &apos;s doing both cops .
someone else was there .
kevin rodriguez .
that &apos;s prima &apos;s former partner .
all the paperwork right up to trey &apos;s arrest
has both their signatures , rodriguez and prima ,
until the day of the interrogation .
after that , it &apos;s just prima .
now , maybe he retired or got relocated or ...
or maybe he wanted off the case .
very smart .
when i apply myself . now , my guess is
if they &apos;re hiding him ,
rodriguez might have something to say .
we only have an hour .
diane , look , i think we may have something .
i &apos;ll meet you at court , but , if you can , delay cuesta .
i may need more time .
the problem starts with guns .
the s.a. &apos; s office should aggressively pursue weapons violations ...
except that the office doesn &apos;t have the resources to do so .
no , that &apos;s not true .
sorry ?
the s.a. has the resources .
they just choose to allocate them elsewhere .
thanks for the clarification .
my point
is that this office &apos;s apathy
of charging gun crimes sends the wrong message .
i agree . further scrutiny
of , uh , this office &apos;s charging policies is warranted .
wait a minute . is that it ?
sorry ?
&quot; further scrutiny . &quot;
now , she just made a good point :
guns are a problem ,
but violent crime is a bigger problem ,
so choices have to be made .
you know what ,
why don &apos;t we take a few minutes here .
thanks , guys .
okay .
finn , you @-@ you can &apos;t leave .
eli , i am obviously intruding in there .
no , you &apos;re not intruding . let me talk to him .
it &apos;s just that there are ... oh .
alicia , something , uh ... a client thing came up .
i have to get back to work .
oh , i understand .
thanks for pitching in .
you &apos;re gonna do great .
you were kicking my butt in there .
i think you kicked mine , too .
so we need to find a new prady .
hey . we should let eli mix up the order of the questions .
that way it makes you pivot on the fly .
sounds good .
peter , you know i respect
the line , the line between husband and governor .
but i need to cross it and ask you a favor .
okay .
cary .
i &apos;m not asking you to consider a pardon-- i &apos;d never go there .
i just want him safe .
you want me to speak to the d.o.c.
and get him put into a minimum security facility .
i don &apos;t want him to look over his shoulder
for the next two years .
this won &apos;t have any political blowback .
this isn &apos;t bill clinton helping marc rich .
i can &apos;t do that ,
and you know why .
you &apos;re right . sorry i asked .
you don &apos;t think i want to help cary ?
he worked for me , for god &apos;s sakes .
let &apos;s just start this thing .
it &apos;s diane .
have you heard anything from kalinda ?
no , not yet .
cuesta &apos;s running behind , thank god .
call me the second you hear from her .
the illinois supreme court ? me ?
yes , sir .
things are moving fast-- i have been asked
by the justices to gauge your interest .
well , yes , of course ,
i &apos;m honored , i &apos;m flattered .
let me walk you through how this will play out .
james castro is corrupt and he &apos;s going down .
especially if alicia florrick becomes the new
state &apos;s attorney , so if you conspired with him ,
if you obstructed justice ...
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , i did nothing wrong .
i wouldn &apos;t play ball with castro ,
so they took me off the case .
and what about your partner ?
he seemed to have no problem running with it .
he &apos;s the senior detective , what the hell am i supposed to do ?
all i care is what you do now .
listen to me .
castro is a lame duck .
he can &apos;t hurt you anymore .
don &apos;t you want to look good in front of the new s.a. ?
what happened in that interrogation ?
why &apos;d they take your name off the transcript ?
well , i &apos;ll certainly be ready .
i &apos;m just ... wow , i @-@ i
i thought flaherty or dominguez
were a shoo @-@ in for the next spot .
well , sir ,
you have fans .
chief justice ryvlan called you an inspired choice .
he thinks you &apos;d bring fresh gusto
to the justices &apos; deliberations .
and when are you meeting with flaherty and dominguez ?
well , there &apos;s no plan to .
not yet . you are our man .
really ?
you sound surprised .
well , you &apos;ve been peter florrick &apos;s man for years ,
and peter florrick wouldn &apos;t cross the street to stop me
from choking , so yeah , i guess i am surprised .
things change .
no , they don &apos;t .
and you keep checking your watch , sir .
and the governor just called to see if i &apos;m still
stuck in this meeting instead of presiding in court
on a case involving his wife &apos;s firm .
okay , this was good .
you tell the governor next time he calls :
go to hell .
he was the most corrupt s.a. this county has ever seen .
and now he &apos;s the most corrupt governor .
and that &apos;s saying something .
why don &apos;t
you just sit down ...
no , no . i &apos;d much
rather destroy his wife &apos;s firm in court .
even though i &apos;ve been successfully stalled
for two hours .
why are you doing this ?
can you be more specific ?
it &apos;s the most fundamental
question any candidate has to answer , mrs. florrick .
why are you running for office ?
why do you want to be state &apos;s attorney ?
i &apos;m running because i believe there is a failure in leadership
in the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office .
no ,
you &apos;re setting up a straw man ,
mr. castro is not in this race .
i &apos;m not just blaming castro .
cook county has a history
of prosecutors with serious ethical shortcomings .
there it is .
well , i think there is a difference
between unethical and controversial .
i know it well . my husband ,
unfortunately , was both .
your husband ...
is not in this race , either .
but he is .
what he did as s.a. ,
what he &apos;s doing now as governor ,
informs voters &apos; perception of me .
for better or worse .
absolutely ,
but i think it is critical that people
understand i am not my husband ,
and that they can expect more of me in office .
more accountability . more responsibility .
you &apos;re never happy . she &apos;s kicking his ass .
i don &apos;t want a career in politics .
i &apos;m simply a lawyer ,
by training and by temperament .
and what that means is i have the character
to put the demands of this job
before my own self @-@ interests
and the discipline to ensure that winning cases
does not become more important than seeing justice done .
based on your past , mr. prady ,
i don &apos;t think you can say the same .
this is a good time for a break .
what the hell ?
you just graduated . that was amazing .
it &apos;s finally going good for her , and you go and do that ?
they needed a break .
they did not need a break . your boy needed a break .
you have a problem with me ?
yes ,
you were worried about your candidate &apos;s ego .
do you guys want me to leave ?
i &apos;m worried about a marriage . you should be , too .
that &apos;s complete and utter crap , and you know it .
think of the long term , elfman .
are you doing this for some stupid little s.a. &apos; s race ...
no , i &apos;m doing it because i want to win .
i am , too . they win if they &apos;re married .
look at them .
oh , come on ,
eli , don &apos;t try to save your boy at my girl &apos;s expense , okay ?
i &apos;m not doing that . they &apos;re tied together at the waist .
that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;re doing . she was taking flight
i &apos;m not trying to save one over the other ,
that is stupid .
in there , she was starting to kik his ass .
i have worked with them for over five years now .
you know what , you don &apos;t know anything .
you know i know them better than you .
you just konw how to protect your meal ticket and that is it .
why don &apos;t you work in the trenches before you say that kind ...
why don &apos;t you get the hell off of my campaign ? !
this is not your campaign .
this is by far the lowest
trick i &apos;ve seen in all my years on the bench .
your honor ?
don &apos;t you dare feign ignorance with me , ms. lockhart .
the fact that you conspired to waste this court &apos;s time
is not only personally offensive ,
it &apos;s potentially actionable .
i have no idea what ...
it shows poor judgment ,
tremendous disrespect , and will deservedly color
every interaction both of you have in this court and
every court in the jurisdiction .
where &apos;s your client ? where the hell is cary agos ?
i &apos;m here , your honor .
good . get your ass up here for sentencing .
your honor ,
we have found the brady violation ,
and we ask ...
oh , yes ,
you have your brady violation
because you delayed me .
uh , your honor ,
with respect , i did nothing of the kind .
and we insist that you see this brady violation .
what did you get ?
kalinda got it . i just pulled it down from her computer .
your honor .
i ask leave to approach ?
with great caution , counselor .
as you would a lion in a cage .
good job . they &apos;re looking at it now .
looking at what ?
what you found .
diane pulled it off your computer .
this is metadata from detective prima &apos;s
account proving that he saw the canadian e @-@ mail .
that is your brady violation .
that &apos;s a flat @-@ out lie .
we have proof ,
your honor , that detective prima buried evidence .
not once have i buried evidence .
diane .
diane .
let me handle this .
this is ridiculous . how can she just
go and smear my name like that ?
is this morse code ?
what am i looking at here ?
it is a metadata report taken from
detective prima &apos;s computer
proving that he was in receipt of information from the canadian police .
geneva , you got to help me out here .
you know this isn &apos;t true .
yes , geneva , help us out here .
because from where i sit it looks like the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office
and the chicago pd are playing fast and loose with the facts .
the state has new evidence to submit .
uh , your honor ...
i just received
a statement from detective rodriguez .
mr. agos may have been a victim of entrapment .
okay , everybody bring their evidence up here .
now .
you okay ?
yeah .
sit down , ms. pine . now .
if your office spent this much
time working within the confines of the law ,
the streets would be free of criminals .
we move that we be allowed to retry this , your honor .
excuse me , but we move for an immediate dismissal , your honor .
this is not just a matter of a cover @-@ up of the original investigation ,
but the police detective who received that e @-@ mail lied to the court .
i did nothing of the kind .
sit down , sir ,
and stop your lying .
i did nothing wrong .
this shows you did something .
now sit down or i &apos;ll hold you in contempt .
okay , here &apos;s how we &apos;re doing this .
mr. agos .
please accept my apologies on behalf of this court
for the egregious and overzealous prosecution you &apos;ve suffered .
i know these words don &apos;t make up
for the last six months of your life--
no words ever can--
but they &apos;re all i have .
and so i will use them now .
this case is dismissed with prejudice .
your honor--
no , leave the poor guy alone .
you &apos;re free to go , mr. agos .
with our apologies .
thank you , thank you .
oh , thank you , kalinda .
thank you .
hello . yeah , diane , what happened ?
i ... thank you .
thank you . no , i &apos;m ...
oh , my god , i &apos;m good , i &apos;m good . i ...
okay . no .
i &apos;ll @-@ i &apos;ll talk to you .
alicia .
you all right ?
