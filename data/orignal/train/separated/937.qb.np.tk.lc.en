lynette confronted tom &apos;s new girlfriend .
you think maybe you could stop
trying to take my husband away from me ?
you think i &apos;m gonna give up on him
just because you can &apos;t accept your marriage is over ?
hey , mike !
ben found out about mike &apos;s past ...
ex @-@ con ?
and hired him .
i can definitely use you .
bree showed gaby the threatening note .
i &apos;m sorry to burden you with this--
why did you have to tell me ?
and then she discovered the location of ben &apos;s new development .
we &apos;re digging up the body ?
ben &apos;s bulldozers start tearing up the woods tomorrow morning .
where are carlos and susan ?
i didn &apos;t wanna freak him out .
and susan has done nothing but freak out , so it &apos;s just us .
but when they got there ...
no !
they found someone had beaten them to it .
no matter what the circumstances ,
bree van de kamp always found a way to stay in control .
she curbed her impulses .
she enforced a strict dress code .
she maintained a strong moral center .
yes , bree was always in control ,
so when it came to handling a crisis ...
this is a nightmare . what are we gonna do ?
it made perfect sense that she was in the driver &apos;s seat .
yeah . i mean , i can &apos;t believe the worst thing
that happened tonight was not getting to move a dead body .
ladies , please , i need to hear myself think .
oh , my god ! what if he &apos;s alive ?
right , and after a 2 @-@ month dirt nap ,
he clawed his way out .
no , someone must have dug him out .
but who ? what if it was the cops ?
no ! i can &apos;t go to jail !
what , and we can ?
yes ! you &apos;ll start a gang .
bree will work in the kitchen . i &apos;m the smallest one .
i am so ending up somebody &apos;s bitch !
shh ! it wasn &apos;t the police .
they would have treated it like a crime scene ,
and that awful yellow tape would have been everywhere .
okay , then . think about this , bree .
what if it &apos;s someone who knows what we did ,
and it made them sick ...
and now they &apos;re going to tell ?
why is she talking like that ?
gaby is engaging in wild speculation ,
which isn &apos;t at all productive .
there has to be a simple explanation .
we just need to take a deep breath and think ,
and the answer will be right in front us .
susan .
oh , my god . of course !
why would susan move the body ?
because she &apos;s cuckoo crazy .
she &apos;s been flipping out ever since we buried the guy .
okay , then what if it was her ? what do we do ?
we march over and we ask if she did it ,
and if she did ,
i know an empty grave that &apos;s going to waste .
but if she didn &apos;t ,
then we just admitted that we went
to the woods without her .
imagine what cuckoo will do with that .
clearly , we have to be diplomatic , crafty .
we &apos;ll ask indirect questions , scan her house for clues .
we &apos;ll gather information without arousing suspicion .
okay , bree . well , seems like you got a good handle on this .
definitely . let us know how it goes .
yes , when it came to a crisis ,
everyone was happy to have bree in the driver &apos;s seat ...
fine . i &apos;ll talk to susan .
even if bree herself would have preferred to be a passenger .
as the mother of five ,
lynette scavo was used to uncomfortable questions .
why are you eating santa &apos;s cookies ?
what happened to my goldfish ?
why were you and daddy making funny noises last night ?
yes , after five children ,
lynette thought she &apos;d heard it all ,
until there was one question ...
are dad and jane gonna get married ?
she never saw coming .
why would you ask that ?
i don &apos;t know .
they &apos;re spending a lot of time together , and ...
it &apos;s okay . you can say it .
they seem really happy .
you told her to say it .
honey , just because people are happy
and spend time together ,
it doesn &apos;t mean they &apos;re gonna get married .
i mean , your aunt renee and i spend time together .
and we &apos;re not getting married
till your mom makes a lot more money .
i &apos;ll get it .
yeah .
hey , hey , hey , hey . you all ready to see &quot; wicked &quot; ?
hello , lynette .
hello .
oh , my god . look at your hair .
we &apos;re twins .
yes , you are .
penny , where did you learn to do that ?
jane taught me .
oh , it &apos;s easy . i could teach you , too .
oh , i know how to do it .
okay . uh , we should go .
we might not be home until 11 : 00 .
on a school night ?
it &apos;s my fault .
i went to high school with the wicked witch ,
and she invited us backstage . is that okay ?
o @-@ oh , my god .
can i , mom ?
what can i say ?
since you asked me in front of penny .
let &apos;s go , zuzu .
yeah .
bye .
&quot; zuzu &quot; ?
yeah . she &apos;s got a cute nickname for penny .
i bet she &apos;s got one for you , too-- &quot; doormat . &quot;
what ?
it &apos;s bad enough she stole your husband ,
and now you &apos;re letting her take your daughter , too ?
what am i supposed to do ?
i &apos;m not gonna drag penny into the middle of this .
well , apparently , jane doesn &apos;t play by the same rules .
i think it &apos;s time to fight dirty .
i don &apos;t know how to do that .
well , you &apos;re in luck .
she might have gone to school with the wicked witch ,
but you went to school with me .
it &apos;s portfolio review time .
that &apos;s the special moment where i tell you all
how you &apos;re letting me down .
okay , uh , speaking as a former teacher--
still pontificating .
now some might say ,
&quot; he must think pretty highly of himself
to judge other people so harshly , &quot;
to which i say , yeah , he does .
can you believe this guy ?
i would die for him .
yeah . that &apos;s a healthy attitude .
so while you &apos;re opening your portfolios
and arranging your works ,
let me tell you what i do not wanna see .
bowls of fruit .
portraits of children .
frigid winter landscapes .
lush summer vistas .
however , i do enjoy a nice ocean scene ...
just so it &apos;s not ruined
by the addition of a sad , little sailboat .
did you look in my portfolio ?
as a matter of fact , i did .
i wanted to steel myself for disappointment .
okay , again , as a former teacher ,
that &apos;s not how you motivate people .
apparently not .
you haven &apos;t grown an inch since you started my class .
your work &apos;s the same as it &apos;s always been--
technically proficient but totally boring .
you never surprise me .
amy , on the other hand ,
is nothing but surprises .
thank you .
don &apos;t talk , dear .
her technique is atrocious .
cats with crayons could draw more convincingly ,
but what she does is real ,
and it bleeds .
and i love it .
i would follow him into hell .
i think we already have .
celia , get back here ! give me that now !
hey , hey , hey , enough with the screaming !
come on . sit down . come on .
what are we having ? spaghetti and meat @-@ shapes ?
well , they started off as balls . what do you want from me ?
is daddy eating with us ?
no , sweetie . he &apos;s taking a nap .
celia ! use a fork , not the doll .
mom , remember that cabin on the lake ?
can we rent it again
for spring vacation ?
spring ? it isn &apos;t even thanksgiving yet .
i know , but we always plan our vacations in the fall .
who knows what we &apos;ll be doing then ?
let &apos;s ... just worry about that later , okay ?
but we know we wanna go there .
why can &apos;t we plan it now ?
will you just stop ? !
just eat your food .
and what am i gonna tell her ?
&quot; sorry , sweetie . we can &apos;t rent that cabin
&apos;cause daddy and i might be in jail by spring . &quot;
will you stop ? we &apos;re not going to jail .
you can &apos;t promise that , carlos .
it &apos;s been two months .
nothing &apos;s happened . relax .
where &apos;s this coming from ?
i &apos;m just saying , a cop could show up at the door any day
and destroy our family .
and we don &apos;t even have someone to take care of the kids .
sure , we do . we named a guardian when we did our will .
yeah , susan . she &apos;ll be my cellmate ,
and we &apos;ll be making license plates with bree and lynette .
ah , right .
well , we &apos;ll just find someone else .
how about mccluskey ?
are you kidding ?
i &apos;ve got meat in the freezer
that &apos;s gonna be around longer than she is .
oh , i know . i know , and they &apos;re perfect .
bob and lee .
no . think about it .
two gay guys who could have been out dancing every night ,
adopted a child ?
they chose this ?
yeah , what does that tell us ? they &apos;re unstable .
no , i &apos;m serious . they &apos;re great parents .
yeah , they are .
okay . bob and lee .
we &apos;ll ask &apos; em .
but don &apos;t worry . we &apos;re not going anywhere .
can &apos;t promise that .
dad and jane are coming . i &apos;m gonna wait on the porch .
oh , and jane &apos;s cooking , so i won &apos;t need dinner .
everything okay ?
i &apos;m sorry . i was just looking
at all these pictures in your baby book .
i guess i was getting a little nostalgic .
mom , my baby book has , like , five pictures in it .
but they &apos;re really good . you wanna see ? look .
here &apos;s you with me and your dad at your 1st birthday .
look at us .
we were really a family then .
we &apos;re a family now . aren &apos;t we ?
of course . oh , of course . it &apos;s just ...
just what ?
well , since you asked ,
things are going to be different
since your dad brought jane into the picture .
you don &apos;t like her , do you ?
oh , i didn &apos;t say that . she &apos;s a very smart lady ,
and she obviously knows how to get what she wants--
medical career , other people &apos;s husbands .
but i &apos;m not gonna say anything bad .
i know . you like her .
well ... i thought she was nice .
she is ... to you .
maybe that &apos;s because she &apos;s trying to steal you , too .
but like i said ,
i don &apos;t wanna say anything bad .
you should go wait out on the porch .
you don &apos;t need to sit here listening to my ...
legitimate whining .
i don &apos;t wanna go over there .
i wanna stay here ... with you .
well , if you feel strongly about it ,
and i can tell you do ,
i could call your dad and make an excuse .
would you ?
sweetie , i would do anything for you .
you are my daughter--
my biological daughter .
thanks . i love you , mom .
i love you , too , bobo .
&quot; bobo &quot; ?
we &apos;ll work on it .
ugh ! i hate you , andre !
susan .
i rang your doorbell twice . is everything okay ?
oh , i can &apos;t get his voice out of my head .
voice ?
yeah . he keeps telling me how bad i am .
oh , really ?
uh , does this voice also tell you to do things ?
sorry . i know i must sound crazy .
it &apos;s just , i &apos;ve been staring at this blank canvas for two days .
i don &apos;t sleep . i don &apos;t eat .
do you dig things up ?
what ?
what ?
did you just ask me if i dug something up ?
oh ! i think someone &apos;s been staring at a blank canvas too long .
bree , what &apos;s going on ?
why are you here ?
okay , i &apos;m just gonna come right out and ask you .
did you ...
hey .
mike , what are you doing home ?
i @-@ i thought you were meeting ben about the job .
yeah , i was , and then he called and said he had to cancel .
something happened at the site ,
and they had to shut down the whole project .
that &apos;s weird .
y @-@ yeah . did he say what it was ?
no .
but he sure didn &apos;t sound good .
well , i really should be going .
wait . you said you were gonna ask me something .
no , i didn &apos;t .
you really need to get away from those paint fumes .
guardians ?
yeah !
you know , in case something happens to us ,
we think you guys would be terrific parents to our girls .
what an honor .
well , you know , we love juanita and ...
the other one .
celia .
tip of my tongue .
but you have so many closer friends on the lane .
what about susan ?
yeah , that &apos;d never work .
why not ?
um , well , susan ...
is ...
a racist .
what ? i @-@ i &apos;ve known her for years .
i &apos;ve never seen her be racist .
it &apos;s new . yeah .
what about bree ?
yeah ! an alcoholic with a house full of guns ? genius .
lynette ? mmccluskey ? anyone at all ?
hang on .
you guys have a problem with ?
it &apos;s just , we &apos;re still learning how to take care of one kid .
you &apos;ve got two , and they &apos;re both ...
you know .
what ?
monsters .
you know it . we know it . why are we dancing around it ?
i was gonna say &quot; spirited . &quot;
no , no , no , no .
see , they used to be like that .
they &apos;ve changed . they &apos;re all grown up now .
i babysat them two months ago .
juanita punched me in the neck ,
and the other one bit me .
celia . her name is celia .
okay , you know , seriously , guys ,
they &apos;re like different people now .
so well @-@ behaved .
yeah . y @-@ you have to see it to believe it .
you know what ? that &apos;s a great idea .
what ? what is ?
why don &apos;t you have us over for dinner tomorrow ?
and we can see how well @-@ behaved they truly are .
oh , my god !
that is a great idea .
but i don &apos;t know about tomorrow , because the girls ...
are busy with their bible pageant ,
and their extensive charity work .
tomorrow .
tomorrow .
bye , guys . see you at dinner .
we &apos;re dead .
yeah .
okay , bob and lee are coming over for dinner tonight .
that gives me nine hours to teach you
to be courteous , gracious , and well @-@ mannered--
exact opposite of what you usually are .
this is why you kept us home from school ?
oh , you &apos;re in school , and class is in session .
okay , now which one is the salad fork ?
what &apos;s salad ?
when is the last time you brushed your ...
is this a lollipop ? !
told you it wasn &apos;t a good hiding place .
come on . think !
who won the tony for best musical in 1995 ?
this is too hard . why can &apos;t gay people like cartoons ?
did you get that out of the garbage ?
didn &apos;t you get my message ?
about penny not being able to come over ? yeah .
been getting a lot of those messages lately .
penny ? !
so why are you here ?
to see my daughter .
i wanna find out what &apos;s going on .
hey !
hey , dad .
i haven &apos;t seen you this week .
is everything okay ?
yeah . i &apos;ve just had a lot of homework and stuff .
why don &apos;t you do it at my place ?
you know , if it-- if it &apos;s science ,
jane lives right upstairs , and she &apos;s a real brainiac .
no , thanks .
i &apos;d rather have mom help .
do you have a problem with jane , sweetie ?
i &apos;ve got a really big test tomorrow , so i should--
hang on . hang on .
may @-@ maybe you and i need a little one @-@ on @-@ one time .
you--you remember that park where i taught you to play catch ?
well , i &apos;m gonna be there tomorrow after school--just me .
we can hang out or-- or do whatever you want .
what do you say ?
okay .
that &apos;s weird . penny and jane were getting along great ,
and then , uh , all of a sudden--
all of a sudden what ?
did you say anything to her about not liking jane ?
penny &apos;s a big girl . she has her own opinions .
okay .
i just wanna make sure that we remember
that this thing between us is between us , not the kids .
hey , don &apos;t blame me .
i &apos;m not the one who jumped into a relationship
without thinking about the consequences .
you made your bed ... with someone else .
i &apos;m gonna go help our daughter with her homework .
bree ?
hello .
i wanted to celebrate your first day of construction
with lunch .
i &apos;m already eating .
there was a little problem .
really ? i hope you don &apos;t think me nosy if i ask--
my guys found a body buried in the woods .
oh , my . did you call the police ?
not yet .
so they found a body . how ?
uh , doing soil samples .
um , they dug it up halloween night ,
put it in a storage shed .
and why have you waited so long to call the police ?
&apos;cause i keep hoping i &apos;ll find a way out of this .
&apos;cause once i call ,
my project becomes a crime scene .
they shut it down . i lose a lot of time ,
and ... a lot of money .
what a shame .
it must be so tempting to just ...
make the body disappear .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ve considered re @-@ burying it
or dissolving it in acid or wrapping it in heavy chains
and dropping it in a lake .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ve considered that .
y @-@ yeah , yeah . of course i have .
uh ... but if i hide this , and it comes out later ,
i &apos;m committing a felony .
and i ...
i can &apos;t take that risk .
i know , but think of all the people who &apos;ll lose their jobs ,
and--and what about the--
the poor men who dug up the body ?
they--they could face charges .
i know that , bree .
i &apos;m sorry . you &apos;re just saying the same stuff
i &apos;ve been thinking all day .
but there &apos;s no way out of this .
there isn &apos;t , is there ?
i got to go call the cops , get this over with .
bree ?
he was a horrible man .
wh @-@ what ? you know who this was ?
he hurt a child ...
someone i care about very much ,
and he was gonna hurt her again .
bree , did you kill him ?
well , tell me you didn &apos;t kill him .
i need to know before i go to the police .
i didn &apos;t kill him .
my friend did , and i helped bury him here .
oh , god .
and you want me to-- to make this go away .
i know it &apos;s a lot to ask .
but yes .
that &apos;s what i want .
well , i &apos;m sorry , bree .
i can &apos;t .
and thank you , lord , for this wonderful food .
and bless our good friends , bob and lee .
we are so grateful to have them as our neighbors .
and bless their daughter jenny who is away at her sleepover .
we miss her so much .
and bless all the children of the world
whether they have a mommy and daddy ,
two mommies ,
or two daddies .
amen .
amen .
that was really nice .
we never pray before meals at our house .
well , some meals you just need to pray before .
that &apos;s a beautiful dress , juanita .
i guess .
oh , juanita . don &apos;t be modest .
isn &apos;t there a story behind that dress you &apos;d like to tell ?
well , actually ,
it &apos;s kind of like anita &apos;s dress in &quot; west side story , &quot;
my all @-@ time favorite musical .
you like musicals ?
hmm . do i like musicals ?
of course you do , silly . you love them !
all right , i &apos;m gonna have to owe you .
i &apos;m out of singles .
i can break a $ 5 .
such a good girl .
she sure is .
anyone need salt ?
no .
oh , god .
you broke me .
and now you &apos;re inside .
i can &apos;t paint .
i just stare at the empty canvas
and wonder how much you &apos;re gonna hate what i do next .
oh , i can help you with that .
you can ?
yes . i &apos;ll hate it a lot .
we good ?
what do i have to do to get you to take me seriously ?
hey .
o @-@ of course .
it makes perfect ...
this is why you like amy better in class .
no , i like amy better in class
because she &apos;s a better artist .
this is why i like her in bed .
see ya .
so as you can see , susan , i &apos;m a little busy ,
so if we &apos;re done ...
we &apos;re not done .
i am totally adrift in that class .
okay .
would it help if i told you what your grade is ?
no . i @-@ i @-@ i--i mean , that &apos;s not what i was--
you &apos;re getting an &quot; a. &quot;
really ?
well , actually , an &quot; a &quot; -plus .
oh , wait . i &apos;m sure that &apos;s not enough for you .
you probably also need to know everybody else will get a &quot; d. &quot;
amy , you &apos;re getting a &quot; d. &quot;
okay !
congratulations , susan .
i do not want you to give me a fake grade .
it doesn &apos;t mean anything if you &apos;re lying .
well , why not ?
you &apos;re lying .
no , i &apos;m not .
every time you sit down to paint
and don &apos;t paint the fear and pain that &apos;s in you ,
you &apos;re lying .
every time you care
what somebody else thinks about your art , you &apos;re lying .
uh , i have to go .
i used to think you were holding something back ,
and now i wonder if there just isn &apos;t anything there .
so enjoy your &quot; a &quot; -plus ,
but don &apos;t come to my class anymore . we &apos;re done .
gaby , it was a wonderful night .
and you were so right about the girls .
they are an absolute delight .
when they sang the &quot; dreamgirls &quot; number--
goose bumps , seriously .
aw , i &apos;m just glad you could come .
you guys are so special to us .
gaby , did you leave the garage door open ?
oh , i mean , you &apos;re practically family .
that &apos;s why when we were thinking
who we &apos;d want to be guardians of our precious angels ,
you two were the only ones we considered .
i mean , the girls absolutely adore you , and ...
what ?
oh , dearar .
this aside , it was a pretty good evening , wasn &apos;t it ?
i don &apos;t get it . what were you thinking ?
your father and i did not raise you like this .
sorry .
can you just tell me why ? i want to understand .
i thought you liked bob and lee .
i do . they &apos;re nice .
then i &apos;m confused . why &apos;d you do it ?
fine . go to bed .
we &apos;ll talk about your punishment tomorrow
and how you &apos;re gonna make this up to them .
is daddy dying ?
what ?
no ! why would you even say that ?
because you guys have been acting different ,
and daddy sleeps a lot ,
and ... everyone seems sad .
even when we &apos;re happy , it &apos;s like ...
i don &apos;t know . just sad .
daddy &apos;s fine ,
and mommy &apos;s fine , too .
then why do you want us to go live with bob and lee ?
i heard you guys talking about it . sorry .
honey , it &apos;s called being a guardian .
every family has that . it &apos;s just in case .
but trust me , nothing &apos;s gonna happen .
so ... we can rent that cabin for spring vacation ?
sure .
and everything &apos;s going to be okay ?
you promise ?
cross my heart .
okay , last week it was a teething biscuit
caked to my ass , and now this ?
why are we stopping ? what are you looking at ?
penny &apos;s meeting tom here for some one @-@ on @-@ one time ,
and i wanted to make sure
saint jane didn &apos;t make it a threesome .
threesome ? looks more like a lonesome to me .
she didn &apos;t come .
well , maybe she &apos;s busy . you said jane &apos;s a doctor , right ?
i was talking about penny .
she didn &apos;t come .
well ... at least you don &apos;t have to worry about jane
busting up your family .
you &apos;re right .
i seem to be doing that just fine on my own .
hello , bree .
chuck . what are you doing here ?
relax . just police business .
following up on a missing person report .
have you seen this man ?
two months ago ?
the night of that dinner party .
we were walking to your house , and we passed him .
right here . you remember ?
i &apos;ve never seen that man before in my life .
have you ever heard of microexpressions , bree ?
they flash across a person &apos;s face
for a fraction of a second ,
revealing their true emotion ,
instead of the one they &apos;re covering with .
it &apos;s how cops know when people lie .
well , that &apos;s all very fascinating ,
but i don &apos;t have time for this .
for example , um ,
when a person is distressed , their eyebrows go up ,
causing lines to appear across the forehead .
don &apos;t touch me .
do you know , the funny thing is ...
i don &apos;t need a microexpression to tell me when you &apos;re lying .
&apos;cause i know that look from personal experience .
i saw it every time i was in your bed
and you said you loved me .
so since i know you &apos;re lying ,
why don &apos;t you start telling me the truth ?
i &apos;m a cop .
i know . keep harassing this woman ,
and you &apos;re gonna wind up an ex @-@ cop .
um , you might want to watch it with the tough guy act , buddy .
oh , unlike you , officer , it &apos;s not an act .
i &apos;ll be seeing you .
big mistake .
well , he &apos;s a delight .
oh , god . i &apos;m shaking .
does this have something to do with , uh ...
what we talked about in the woods ?
yes .
then you &apos;ve got nothing to be scared about .
well , it &apos;s pretty hard to build a case without a body .
oh , my . thank you .
why would you do that for me ?
ah , you never know . maybe someday ...
i might need something from you .
what are we ... what ?
i thought we were going to the mall .
no .
sweetie , listen--
can we get outta here ?
please ?
no , we can &apos;t .
you need to spend some time with your dad .
i don &apos;t want to .
i &apos;m not giving you a choice . look at him . look .
you know why he &apos;s sitting over there ?
because he misses you so much .
then he shouldn &apos;t have left us for jane .
well , that &apos;s not what happened .
he didn &apos;t leave us . he left me .
and he didn &apos;t do it for jane . he did it because ...
we just don &apos;t make each other happy ,
and then he met jane , and i guess she does ...
make him happy , so ...
here we are .
but you said that jane--
i @-@ i know .
i said a lot of things i shouldn &apos;t have .
i &apos;m sorry .
he loves you , penny .
we both do .
there &apos;s no bad guys here .
there &apos;s just people trying to figure things out ,
and there &apos;s one of those people .
and i know he would love to play catch with his daughter .
you &apos;re way prettier than her .
you , uh , want something to drink ?
uh , no .
this isn &apos;t a social visit . i need to ask you something ,
and i couldn &apos;t do it over the phone .
remember when i said i might need you to , uh ,
color outside the lines from time to time .
yeah .
we found a body out in chapman woods .
now it &apos;s probably just some homeless guy .
but if we report it--
i &apos;ll take care of it .
just like that ?
there &apos;s nothing else you need to know ?
it &apos;s better if i don &apos;t .
i owe you one .
oh , hey , ben .
hey , susan . uh , i &apos;m just leaving .
see you at work .
so you got the job ? that &apos;s great .
yeah .
just wait till you hear what the job is .
so ... ben will dispose of the body ,
permanently , he assures me ,
and we will be in the clear .
wow , just like that .
bree ? it &apos;s me !
come in !
did anybody else think this would feel ... better ?
i think it feels great . well done , bree .
guess we got away with it .
oh , thank god you &apos;re here .
susan , what &apos;s wrong ?
okay , uh ... you know how ben is
putting up those new condoms ?
he &apos;s doing it in chapman woods .
and some of his guys found the body .
he just asked mike to get rid of it .
what ?
you &apos;re kidding .
get out of town !
what &apos;s going on ?
sweetie , we kind of already knew .
who told you ?
no one . we k @-@ kinda went out there to move the body ,
but it was gone .
and--and then i went to ben , and he had it ,
and he was planning on getting rid of it .
so , wait .
y @-@ you knew all of this ,
and it never occurred to you to tell me ?
yeah .
but bright side is we &apos;re all in the clear now .
yeah . chardonnay ?
i don &apos;t believe it . you drag me into this thing .
i am out of my mind with guilt ,
then there &apos;s this massive complication
which could endanger me and my family ,
and you don &apos;t even tell me ?
and here &apos;s why we didn &apos;t tell her .
what the hell does that mean ?
oh , let &apos;s face it , susan . you &apos;re kind of a loose cannon .
yeah , i mean , 15 minutes after we made a pact
to keep this secret ,
you were begging us to tell mike .
oh , yeah ? well , guess what ? i didn &apos;t tell mike .
carlos did . so who &apos;s your loose cannon now ?
what ? why would carlos do that ?
oh , i don &apos;t know . maybe because unlike you ,
he has a conscience .
oh , don &apos;t push it , susan !
hey , hey , hey . take it easy .
the important thing is the body is gone .
we &apos;re gonna be okay .
yeah , as long as we don &apos;t get another letter .
what letter ?
yeah , what letter ?
gaby , we never told them about the letter .
crap .
susan , wait .
no , no , you get a blackmail letter--
the same one
mary alice got , and you don &apos;t tell me ?
we didn &apos;t think you could handle it .
you said it yourself . you &apos;re out of your mind with guilt .
our pact was to keep this thing a secret ,
not to keep secrets from each other .
we &apos;re done .
oh , don &apos;t you think you &apos;re overreacting a little ?
i don &apos;t think she is .
what &apos;s your excuse for not telling me about the letter ?
well , honey , you were going through all that stuff with tom .
yeah , we were trying to protect you .
protect me ? what am i , a child ?
someone knows what we did . i have a right to know that .
of course you do .
you know what my life feels like right now ?
everything i thought i knew ,
everything i could count on is going away .
that &apos;s not true . you can count on us .
no ! apparently i can &apos;t !
yes , we &apos;re all seeking control over something in our lives .
we may want to
cover up the remains of a troubling secret ...
or ease the pain of letting go ...
or erase the mistakes of our children .
but sometimes the only way we can
truly change our lives ... finally ,
is by letting go completely ...
