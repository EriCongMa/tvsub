should you really be sitting in sheldon &apos;s spot ?
he &apos;s texas , he &apos;ll never know .
i wouldn &apos;t be so sure about that .
yeah , he has a very sensitive butt .
well , it &apos;s true .
once i saw him sit on a bunch of loose change
and add it up .
have you heard from howard ?
i did . his talk at nasa went great .
sheldon didn &apos;t heckle him ?
no , in fact , he was so well @-@ behaved ,
howie bought him a buzz aldrin bobble head
and astronaut ice cream .
hey , guys.- hey , stewart !
how &apos;s it going ?
good .
sheldon &apos;s out of town , so we can do whatever we want .
we even ordered from the thai place he doesn &apos;t like .
oh , how is it ?
disgusting . do not tell him .
what do you guys want to do tonight ?
i don &apos;t know .
well , i told howie if i wasn &apos;t busy ,
i &apos;d spend the night at his mom &apos;s .
so for god &apos;s sake , think of something .
stuart ? are you okay ?
no , i don &apos;t feel so ...
oh , stuart ?
stuart ?
oh , my god , you guys need to do something !
stuart ?
calling 911 .
well , it &apos;s too late .
what do you mean it &apos;s too late ?
he &apos;s been murdered by someone in this room .
oh , my god .
oh , come on !
welcome to another classic
koothrappali murder mystery dinner .
i &apos;m leaving .
you can &apos;t leave .
you &apos;re a suspect in the mysterious murder of stuart bloom .
i didn &apos;t know his last name was bloom .
yeah , it &apos;s bloom .
are you really gonna lie on the floor
and pretend to be dead all night ?
what do you think i was gonna do at home ?
are you gonna make us pretend to be a bunch of lame characters
with silly accents ?
&quot; lame characters with silly ac ... &quot;
what kind of actress are you ?
you &apos;re right , i &apos;m sorry .
it ... sounds like fun .
thank you .
that kind of actress . this sucks !
come on , guys .
raj put a lot of effort into this .
and that &apos;s great .
it &apos;s not sad , it &apos;s great .
i think it might be fun to be someone else tonight .
actually , you &apos;re all just gonna be yourselves .
all right , if i &apos;m doing this ,
i &apos;m playing to win , so just to be clear :
if we &apos;re ourselves , that means one of us killed stuart ?
very good , bernadette .
you are a regular byomkesh bakshi .
what is that , like , the indian sherlock holmes ?
or is sherlock holmes the english byomkesh bakshi ?
according to wikipedia , sherlock holmes came first .
great , everyone &apos;s a byomkesh bakshi .
now ... here are some
secret facts about each of you ,
including whether you are the murderer .
throughout the game , feel free to ask
each other questions to uncover clues .
got it . hey ...
who &apos;s the murderer ?
any question but that .
sorry . hey ...
who &apos;s not the murderer ?
bernadette , can you not stand so close to me ?
what do you care ? you &apos;re dead .
suit yourself .
but i can kind of ... see up your skirt .
thank you for my bobble head .
thank you for not making fun of me during my speech .
it wasn &apos;t easy . was it buzz ?
we can &apos;t show up to your mom &apos;s empty @-@ handed .
we should bring something .
i already am .
i &apos;m bringing the gift of knowledge .
oh , boy .
despite what her bible says ,
recent archeological studies indicate that
although camels are referenced in the old testament ,
they didn &apos;t exist in the middle east
until hundreds of years later .
i was gonna say we pick up a cake or a pie .
but an insult to her faith is always thoughtful .
so , what happens next ?
i can &apos;t tell you that .
but perhaps the killer dropped
a fun and imaginative clue
somewhere in the apartment .
ooh , i &apos;m gonna check the fridge ,
and see if there are any clues inside a beer .
hey , i @-@ i found something .
it looks like a little man with a briefcase .
oh , no , no . that &apos;s clarence darrow .
it &apos;s from a game sheldon made up called chutes and lawyers .
you slide down a chute and then work your way back up
through the appellate system .
well , unlike that , my games are much more fun .
okay , can i ask you something ?
why do you like making us do this stuff ?
well , i guess it goes back to when i was a fat kid in india ,
and didn &apos;t have any friends .
i didn &apos;t know you were fat .
yeah , i was ...
i was 200 pounds by the time i was in middle school .
kids were mean .
cows may be sacred there ,
but it doesn &apos;t help if you look like one .
anyway , i was pretty lonely ,
so i had to make up my own stories and games ,
and i promised myself
if i ever made any friends that ...
that i would play those games with them .
that is so sweet .
i &apos;ve seen old pictures of you .
you were never a fat kid .
no , i was svelte as a gazelle .
a gazelle blessed with a flair for storytelling .
hey , what about this ? it looks like a receipt .
what &apos;s it for ?
for a cup of coffee .
but it &apos;s dated 20 years from now .
from the future ? !
how fun and imaginative .
so one of us came back from the future
to murder stuart ?
correct .
does the gazelle with a flair for storytelling
know he &apos;s just ripping off terminator ?
里面的两集故事 《 士兵 》 和 《 玻璃手的魔鬼 》 的启发而创作
does the smart @-@ ass know that terminator was actually
ripped off from an outer limits script called
demon with a glass hand , by harlan ellison ?
oh , does the gazelle know that according to harlan ellison ,
it was not ripped off from demon with a glass hand ,
but was ripped off from another outer limits script he wrote
called the soldier ?
i &apos;m gonna need another clue .
okay ...
give me the flowers and pie .
but if we show up and you &apos;re holding them ,
she &apos;ll think they &apos;re only from you .
they are only from me .
you said the gift of you was enough .
yes ... but now that i &apos;ve seen what the gift of me
with flowers and pie looks like ,
there &apos;s no going back .
boy , i can &apos;t wait to see the look on her face ...
we &apos;re leaving right now .
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing .
what ? sheldon , tell me what &apos;s going on !
i saw my mommy with a naked man
and she was trying to be a mommy again .
you ready to talk about it ?
i &apos;m not nearly drunk enough .
okay .
do you have any idea what it &apos;s like to see
your mother ravaging someone ?
does a brisket count ?
i &apos;m sorry , buddy , that &apos;s rough .
but didn &apos;t she know we were coming ?
no .
i wanted to surprise her .
what am i supposed to say to her after something like this ?
well , did she see you in the window ?
no .
then don &apos;t say anything .
i have to .
how can we ever hope to have a healthy relationship
if i don &apos;t tell her how disappointed i am ,
and that i &apos;ll never forgive her ?
well , don &apos;t do it on the phone .
no , i &apos;m just going to tell her i &apos;m coming
so she can give that good time charlie the heave @-@ ho .
that &apos;s some tough talk .
i may need to cut you off .
yeah , maybe you better .
i took a pretty big sip .
look , she &apos;s a grown woman .
and @-@ and your dad &apos;s been gone a long time .
maybe this is none of your business .
i beg to differ .
i used to live in those genitals .
and if someone wants to move into my old room ,
i should at least get a vote .
okay , murder suspects ,
leonard has found the time machine the killer must &apos;ve used .
you &apos;re all inside it ,
and we hurtle through the very fabric of time .
and welcome to 20 years in the future .
hey , you guys just time @-@ traveled .
stop looking so bored .
well , my beer isn &apos;t flat and my rack &apos;s not saggy .
so far , the future &apos;s great .
hey , can i go to the bathroom ?
fine , just try not to look too alive .
that &apos;s my jam .
so one of us went back in time to kill stuart ?
but why ?
perhaps this will help .
here are some facts
about yourselves in the future
that might contain a clue .
hey , i @-@ i won the nobel prize in physiology .
then i used the money to buy stuart &apos;s comic book store ,
and close it down so sheldon would pay attention to me .
not the worst idea .
hey , i &apos;m a famous actress living in london .
i &apos;m a professor at stanford .
so i guess you two are making it work long distance .
oh , no .
in this game , as your careers both took off ,
you drifted apart .
kind of like how future me
lost touch with you guys after i became boy toy
for the wrinkled , but still flexible , madonna .
what does your card say , bernadette ?
eh , eh , eh , hang on .
do @-@ do you think we &apos;d really drift apart
if we both became successful ?
of course not .
if i became a famous actress and had to move ,
you would just come with me .
but if i get a chance to be a tenured professor ,
i might not have that much choice in where i end up .
yeah , but if i become a successful actress ,
we wouldn &apos;t need the money .
well , you don &apos;t go into science for the money .
speak for yourself .
last month , my company both invented
and cured restless eye syndrome .
ka @-@ ching , ya blinky chumps .
so , wait , if my career took me somewhere else ,
you might not go ?
he started it .
okay , okay , guys-- new back stories .
uh , penny and leonard , you two lovebirds are
super successful and living in new york .
uh , you &apos;re an actress , you &apos;re a professor
and you have three beautiful kids .
great .
really ? you think i &apos;m putting
this body through three kids ?
okay , let &apos;s do this .
good luck .
you ...
aren &apos;t you gonna come with me ?
while you confront your mother about her sex life ?
i &apos;d rather go back to that bar in ass @-@ less chaps .
mother ?
mother .
mother ?
shelly ! i &apos;m so glad you &apos;re here !
i saw you having naked sex .
what are you talking about ?
earlier , i came here to surprise you .
i looked in the window and i saw you with a man .
oh , shelly , i &apos;m so sorry .
come in .
maybe we should sit down
and talk about this .
can you recommend a surface you haven &apos;t had coitus on ?
that &apos;s not funny .
maybe we should sit at the table .
well , i &apos;m sure that , uh ,
you ...
have a lot of questions .
who was he ?
his name is ron .
i met him at my prayer group .
how long have you been involved with him ?
a few months .
and of those few months ,
how long have you been a demented sex pervert ?
that is no way to speak to your mother .
perhaps not .
but it is a way to speak to a woman
who quoted the bible to me my whole life ,
and then desecrates one of ethan allen &apos;s finest sofas .
i will give you one opportunity , young man ,
to apologize .
or what ?
or i will send you to your room .
that &apos;s ridiculous .
i am a grown man .
i am a professional scientist .
and i currently occupy the moral high ground .
go to your room .
but i occupy the moral high ground .
go to your room .
but i &apos;m a professional scientist .
go ... to your room !
i &apos;m a grown man .
can we please get back to the game ?
i @-@ i @-@ in a minute .
i @-@ i @-@ i don &apos;t understand why any success you have in acting
is more important than any i have in science .
okay , if you do something cool in science ,
you might change the world .
if i become a famous actress ...
i &apos;m not gonna tell you why movie stars are the best .
they just are .
i &apos;m surprised you guys never talked about this stuff .
like you and sheldon have everything figured out ?
actually , our relationship agreement
covers a wide array of scenarios ,
including career changes , financial instability ,
intelligent dog uprising ...
fyi , we plan on selling out the human race hard .
in 20 years , who knows what &apos;ll happen with any of us ?
i think you and leonard will be together .
you do ?
yeah .
i think you &apos;re the best couple i know .
that &apos;s so sweet .
what the hell ? !
excuse me ?
ah @-@ da @-@ da @-@ da @-@ da !
let the dead man talk .
so , why do you think that ?
uh , well , i feel like you guys make each other better .
penny brought leonard out of his shell .
and it seems like leonard makes penny
think more deeply about the world .
i don &apos;t know .
together , you two kind of make one awesome person .
aw , stuart .
now i feel bad for murdering you .
oh , come on !
penny did it ! i win !
suck it , jackasses !
hey , can i come in ?
apparently any man is welcome in this house .
why not you ?
i thought you were waiting in the car .
that was an hour ago , sheldon .
a jew sits in front of a house in texas that long ,
&quot; for sale &quot; signs start to go up .
i take it things didn &apos;t go smoothly with your mom .
no .
i &apos;m not sure how we &apos;re going to get past this .
you know , i ...
i sort of went through something
like this myself .
howard , we &apos;ve all seen your mother naked .
that woman needs to learn how to tie a robe .
i &apos;m talking about when my mom started seeing someone
a couple years after my dad left .
i didn &apos;t know she did .
yeah , she was dating this guy ,
and i was kind of a jerk to her about it .
what did you do ?
well , let &apos;s just say it was the most vicious
bar mitzvah speech in the history of temple beth el .
anyway , she broke up with him .
and she &apos;s basically been alone ever since .
she never said it , but i always felt
i was the reason why .
i &apos;m sorry .
although , based on your story ,
you absolutely were the reason why .
all i &apos;m saying is you might not want
to get in the way of your mom &apos;s happiness .
you may have a point .
i love my mother .
even if she fornicates like a demonic weasel .
and the healing begins .
hello .
hello .
are you ready to discuss this calmly , like adults ?
i am .
shelly , i &apos;m sorry that you saw what you saw .
i know that this is hard for you .
i think what most upsets me about it , mother ,
is the hypocrisy .
doesn &apos;t this contradict
all the religious rules you &apos;ve been espousing your whole life ?
you &apos;re right , it does , and it &apos;s something
that i &apos;m struggling with these days .
then why are you doing it ?
because i &apos;m not perfect , shelly .
and that man &apos;s booty is .
well , this is confusing for me .
but i don &apos;t want to stand in the way of your happiness .
so ...
i &apos;ll condemn you internally
while maintaining an outward appearance of acceptance .
that is very christian of you .
mother , if you &apos;re going to conduct your life in this fashion ,
then i should let you know that the world has changed
since you were a young woman .
you know , it &apos;s not all sock hops ,
soda jerks and segregation anymore .
how old do you think i am ?
my point is that you &apos;re going to need to be careful .
you used to be protected
by your pre @-@ enlightenment mythology ,
but now you &apos;re going to need a stronger friend
named latex .
are you having the sex talk with me ?
well , someone has to .
oh , dear lord !
yeah , well ...
no , don &apos;t look to him . he &apos;s mad at you right now .
oh , come on , don &apos;t pout .
i &apos;m sorry i ruined your game .
i &apos;m not pouting , i &apos;m brooding .
which is how sexy men pout .
it actually was kind of fun .
you &apos;re just saying that .
yeah .
i liked the time travel element .
thank you . i thought it was inspired .
it was . by terminator .
well , i hope 20 years from now ,
we really are all still together
and still friends .
definitely .
of course .
well , hey , how about this ?
whether we &apos;re friends , not friends ,
scattered around the world , no matter what ,
let &apos;s all promise to meet in front of this building
exactly 20 years from tonight at 8 : 00 p.m.
and have dinner like we always do .
i love it .
putting it in my phone right now .
yeah , me , too .
my phone doesn &apos;t have a calendar .
it &apos;s all right , i &apos;ll just write it on my hand .
and it &apos;s done .
yup , we &apos;re all in .
all right , i &apos;ll see you guys in 20 years .
i knew it .
