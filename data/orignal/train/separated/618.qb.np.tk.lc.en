witnesses placed a second shooter at the scene .
after our suspect whacked mr. rogers ,
here he went , a little shootout in the hall .
maybe an armed neighbor .

no one recognized this dude .
they exchanged gunfire then disappeared . both of them .
the second shooter , any description ?
the word &quot; beautiful &quot; came up .
beautiful ?
like a movie star .
he punked me .
he &apos;s really that good ?
good &apos;s not even the right word .
i mean , you know , the dude &apos;s completely artless .
i mean , there &apos;s no sophistication to him whatsoever .
but he &apos;s pure , you know ?
no fear , no hesitation . there &apos;s nothing .
he as fast as you ?
no , he &apos;s faster .
you will get him .
how can you be so sure , hey ?
because you always do .
baby .
yeah ?

hey , mister .
goddamn it . shit .
is that what i think it is ?
oh , the tattoo ?

i will be back .
jesus christ .
oh , jesus .

why did you do this ?
i am afraid .
what are you afraid of , honey ?
we &apos;re going to hell for what we did .
do you know what hell is ?
it &apos;s not fire and devils .
all that stuff they taught you
when you was little .
we make our heaven and our hell
while we &apos;re alive ,
every time we cause pain ,
every time we cause suffering .
cicero .
hey , it &apos;s me . did i wake you up ?
no .
you said on your message to give you a call , so ...
okay , here &apos;s the deal .
both of our victims were informants .
could be something there , right ?
yeah , could be .
nice work .
okay , i need you to follow up on it .
i got to be in court all day ,
but i really think we &apos;re getting close on the thing .
it &apos;s got to have something to do with
how they got setup , the ambush .
did you hear about that
&quot; stabbing in henderson &quot; last night ?
yeah , yeah , what about it ?
i got a hunch it might be our guy .
it &apos;s not his m.o.
our guy &apos;s a shooter , not a stabber .
like i said , i got a hunch .
yeah , so did quasimodo .
look where it got him .
i am going to go ask a few questions .
after you do the follow @-@ up , right ?
got it cleared with the henderson , i see .
i am headed up there now .
hey , listen , i have to be in court all day .
i am asking you to do this .
it &apos;s my case .
... bring us nothing but the same politics as usual .
i have fought to keep government honest ,
save you money and to lower your taxes .
above all ,
i will be someone who listens to you .
the choice is simple ,
vote margie kantol .
in local news ,
a henderson man
is fighting for his life this morning
after being brutally attacked
at a gentlemen &apos;s club .
the man is suffering from stab wounds .
doctors describe his condition as critical .
sponge .
sponge .
we think he will be heading back . your position ?
tehachapi .
try the hospital in clark county .
his third victim survived the hit .
he will be wanting to finish the job .
where are you ?
good night .
doctor .
what the hell is that ?
back in the room , back in the room .
police officer , get back .
police .
he went that way .
i am a cop . where &apos;d he go ?
he went downstairs , officer .
how do you have my dad &apos;s phone ?
he asked me to call you .
are you the one who killed him ?
yes .
i am going to find you and i am going to kill you .
do what you need to do .
but you better be sure ,
because it &apos;s a long , dark road you &apos;re headed down .
i lost him .
client wants to pull the job .
no . no way . you tell him to back off .
i have got this under control . all right ?
you &apos;re running out of time .
where &apos;s the old man ?
dead .
don &apos;t lie to me .
i will show you the damn grave .
how long ago ?
i don &apos;t know .
three or four years .
hold still .
how long you been out ?
couple of days .
and why are you here ?
came here to kill the old man .
why ?
because he set us up .
what makes you think that ?
gary went to him for advice on the bank job
and he wanted full share .
gary wouldn &apos;t give it to him .
so do you think the old man was capable of
murdering his own son ?
yeah .
no .
nope .
he couldn &apos;t have .
what makes you so sure ?
i just ... i just know .
tell me .
say it .
mom .
because ...
he loved your brother too much .
i am sorry .
and that &apos;s the truth and that &apos;s not your fault .
it wasn &apos;t like i could pretend you were his .
he was reminded of that every time he looked at you .
you never stood a chance .
sorry that i couldn &apos;t ...
that i didn &apos;t protect you .
the beatings and ...
gary was the only one who ever cared for me .
why &apos;d he pull you in on that job ?
you were never a part of what they did .
when his driver fell out , i volunteered .
why ?
he owed the wrong people a lot of money .
and he needed me .
if it wasn &apos;t the old man , then who set us up ?
driven by his passions and desires .
you will never truly be free unless you freely forgive .
hate is like a chain around your neck
that leads you to places you don &apos;t want to go .
it will lead you into darkness and desolation .
you become a slave to that hatred ,
and it will only lead to your own destruction .
you must break free .
hey , cowboy .
you okay , man ?
yeah .
you laid eyes on him at least .
hey , well done .
thanks , man .
i got to call you back .
still in one piece .
good job .
good lead , cowboy . you almost got him .
we got close . yeah .
it was a good hunch .
well , even quasimodo has his day .
and don &apos;t ever hang up on me again .
roger that .
i hate to spoil your moment . got something i want to show you .
i think we may have caught a break .
you said &quot; we &quot; again .
i did .
our latest victim was a ci too .
so all three are informants .
mm @-@ hm . all got records , armed robbery , rape , assault .
but none did any serious time .
they all snitched their way out of the joint over and over .
what are the odds of that ?
slim and none .
i am waiting on the informant logs now .
who are these ?
former accomplices of the victims .
let &apos;s split them up , check them out . i will take these .
and i know there &apos;s not a man ,
woman or child in this church today
that has not sinned .
but god did not bring you down on this earth to be perfect .
no .
god wants you down here to be saved .
and when you &apos;re down with god ,
god is eternally down with you .
when jesus knew his time was near ,
when he knew he was going to die ,
when he knew they would not take that cup from his lips ,
his thoughts were not upon his own .
his thoughts were for those that he loved .
amen .
that &apos;s right .
his thoughts were for those that he loved , preparing them .
why is that ? he used the example of his birth .
that &apos;s right . here it is . jesus told them how a woman
goes through pain and sorrow in the throes of childbirth .
but then as soon as she has delivered , there is no more anguish .
after all the screaming , after all the pushing ,
after all the blood and the tears ,
there &apos;s only joy that a new child has been born .
hallelujah .
and i will tell you my ...
amen . amen .
amen .
amen . amen . amen .
hallelujah . amen .
amen . sing me a song .
i was wondering when you were going to show up .
you have been the subject of many of my sermons these past few days .
i heard .
you heard . but did you listen ?
everything okay , baby ?
everything &apos;s just fine , honey .
i was just catching up with
an old acquaintance .
you go on home now .
let &apos;s take a walk .
was that your son ?
adopted .
one of five .
wayward boys .
not unlike me or you at that age .
you turned your life around .
doesn &apos;t change what you did .
i wouldn &apos;t want it to .
i know it sounds cold ,
but every good i have done hinged on the evil i did .
who set us up ?
i don &apos;t know .
i never did find out how they knew about your safe house .
when i got the call , &quot; easy money , &quot; they said .
all i had to do was guard the door , be the lookout .
i was in a dark place in my life .
numb to the chaos and ...
right here .
but when they cut that boy &apos;s throat ...
oh , jesus , man . no .
that boy they killed was my brother .
i can &apos;t bring him back .
and in my heart i am sorry .
i still took my cut , spent it on drugs and women .
ended up in prison .
but it was there that i found my calling .
to save and help boys like me
and like you .
it was there that i gave my life to god .
god can &apos;t save you from me .
but maybe he could save you from yourself .
i know there &apos;s good ...
you don &apos;t know me .
i know the devil got your heart twisted
with vengeance and hate .
the lord is merciful . he sees in your soul .
fragile , ain &apos;t it ?
that moment , that sets us on our road to damascus .
sermon &apos;s over .
can you at least find it in your heart
to forgive me for what i did ?
i can &apos;t .
that &apos;s all right .
that &apos;s all right .
because i forgive you for what you &apos;re about to do .
lord , see into this man &apos;s heart . he &apos;s good inside .
oh , lord , save this man &apos;s soul .
i know you see his heart .
release him from the bondage of hatred and vengeance , lord .
go back to your family .
that &apos;s one hell of a peashooter you got there .
how &apos;s the recoil ?
where are you ?
inyo county at the reservoir . they &apos;re here . both of them .
what ? did you call for backup ?
there &apos;s no time for that .
okay , don &apos;t do this .
i am sorry i keep stepping on your case .
i don &apos;t care about that .
want you to do me a favor .
if i don &apos;t make it out of this ,
tell my son that his daddy went out like a man .
i am on my way . please , just wait for me .
i am just going with the flow .
damn .
aren &apos;t you going to reach for it ?
come on .
sporting chance .
i have got nothing against you .
i have been trying to kill you for days
and you have got nothing against me ?
i am starting to think
you don &apos;t take me very seriously , friend .
what do you want from me ?
how about a little respect ? hey ?
a little professional courtesy from a peer .
some acknowledgment of my skills .
you have got issues .
screw you .
i win .
you think you &apos;re done ?
you can &apos;t put it together , can you ?
there must be one more .
the one who hired me .
he &apos;s still alive .
i am going to kill you all .
drop the gun .
don &apos;t move .
slowly .
put the gun down .
no . put the goddamn gun down .
no . this is my job .
i finish my job .
how you going to finish this when you &apos;re dead ?
so you &apos;re the guy that hired me .
you shouldn &apos;t have done that .
i had to finish what i started .
why &apos;d you hire me then ?
i didn &apos;t think i was up to it .
after you missed him ,
i figured i should get involved
before he came gunning for me .
he didn &apos;t even know about you .
i figured that out
when he didn &apos;t finish me off at the hospital .
his brother &apos;s girlfriend was my informant down in l.a.
she told me about the job .
hired some more of my informants down there .
they helped me take down their score .
so , what now ?
now ?
i ride off into the sunset .
i forgot to pay you .
you know , i don &apos;t get you .
why do you put yourself through all this shit
for one lousy dollar ?
it &apos;s my price . call it a hobby .
you know what , keep it .
i didn &apos;t earn it .
don &apos;t contact me again , i am done .
yeah , me too .
detective cicero ?
yeah , i can &apos;t reach him .
okay , hopefully he will turn up .
we have got units en route , we will see you shortly .
wait a minute .
you didn &apos;t flip him this case , did you ?
i didn &apos;t flip him the case .
is that what you thought ?
he asked for it , right ?
he begged for it .
and i felt sorry for him , so i caved .
is there a reason why we &apos;re talking about this right now ?
no. no reason .
okay , i will see you shortly .
&quot; go with the flow &quot; my ass .
marina ? hey , it &apos;s me , honey .
well , i got him , i closed the case .
yeah , yeah , i am fine .
as a matter of fact , i feel perfect .
better than i ever have. yeah ?
yeah , and i am going to get rid of the other stuff too .
don &apos;t you worry , i promise .
i will be home in a couple hours .
listen , you &apos;re not going to believe this .
i have been reading up on women ,
and i think i got you figured out .
we &apos;re going to be fine .
yeah , honey , it &apos;s over .
i want to start brand @-@ new , honey .
how ?
metal plate .
i can &apos;t feel anything .
i created my own hell .
and i am the demon who crawled up out of it .
hello ?
baby .
where are you ? i am coming home .
today , i want to talk to you about forgiveness .
i am waiting on the informant logs now .
who are these ?
former accomplices of the victims .
let &apos;s split them up , check them out . i will take these .
and i know there &apos;s not a man ,
woman or child in this church today
that has not sinned .
but god did not bring you down on this earth to be perfect .
no .
god wants you down here to be saved .
and when you &apos;re down with god ,
god is eternally down with you .
when jesus knew his time was near ,
when he knew he was going to die ,
