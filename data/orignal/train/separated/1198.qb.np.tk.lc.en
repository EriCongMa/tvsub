i want some of your study aid ,
the kind with the childproof cap .
it looks like you haven &apos;t been sleeping .
i just really have a headache .
and you &apos;re lying again .
i &apos;m visiting my dad .
he &apos;s lecturing in syracuse .
we could have this place . it could be our secret .
i &apos;m tired of lying .
it belongs to alison .
alison &apos;s running out of money ,
and shana &apos;s the only one who knows how to reach her .
one of alison &apos;s stories kept on sticking in my brain .
it &apos;s the hart and huntsman , where alison &apos;s mystery man
took her for pie ane beer .
i went to the hart and huntsman
and ezra was there eating the pie .
the pie and the beer ! board shorts ale !
you think he &apos;s &quot; a &quot; ? we have to call aria .
i don &apos;t think we should tell her
until we &apos;re a hundred percent sure .
you wanted to see me ?
please , come in . and , uh , close the door .
how many gold stick variations are there ?
thirty @-@ two . they &apos;ll never miss us .
aria still isn &apos;t answering .
what are you gonna say if we get her ?
&quot; isn &apos;t it funny how your old boyfriend
turned out to be a stalking whackjob ? &quot;
i &apos;d like to know a lot more before we talk to her .
you take that side of the desk ,
you take the file cabinet .
what are we looking for ?
evidence .
we &apos;re gonna need a lot more if we &apos;re going to prove to aria
that ezra &apos;s ...
not who he says he is .
that he &apos;s &quot; a. &quot;
how are we going to convince aria
if we can &apos;t even say it out loud ?
if i was a teacher and my students
only got me coffee mugs ,
i would so start flunking people .
tell me that &apos;s what it looks like ?
ali &apos;s journal .
so that was ezra at the cabin ?
we always knew there were two of them .
ezra and shana ?
ezra and somebody .
what is mona doing here ?
i don &apos;t know .
is she looking for the book ?
how should i know ?
quiet .
why is mona stealing papers from mr. fitz ?
maybe she isn &apos;t stealing them .
maybe she &apos;s delivering them .
shouldn &apos;t we do this in your room ?
my parents are out of town , being lawyers .
sounds romantic .
one &apos;s in chicago , the other one &apos;s in boston .
i don &apos;t think there are any pages missing .
okay , are you , like , getting a cold ?
allergies .
what about the phone number and email addresses
i found with the money ?
i have a reverse directory for that phone number .
we can send emails to those addresses ,
but we should do it from someplace that can &apos;t be traced .
what do we know about shana ?
that she &apos;s missing .
no , i mean , really . what do we know ?
she was with paige .
can we please not go there .
i &apos;m just saying , we don &apos;t have a lot of details about that .
not those kind of details . i mean ,
did shana ever mention anything about georgia ,
something that connects with where ali &apos;s hiding ?
i thought you didn &apos;t want us looking for ali .
i think &quot; a &quot; changed the rules on that .
i &apos;m in the same place emily is--
i &apos;m more angry than i am scared .
what do you want me to do ?
interrogate my girlfriend about her summer fling ?
basically .
isn &apos;t there some sort of mona @-@ fitz connection
we should be worrying about ?
i cannot worry about anything else . my brain is full .
so &apos;s mine .
we &apos;ll tag up on this later . aria should be back by then .
what ?
did it ever occur to you guys
that we found that book awfully easy ?
what are you thinking ?
i &apos;m thinking what if it wasn &apos;t &quot; a &quot;
who put that book in the desk ?
em , get real , this is all about the a @-@ ness of things .
i might have not said like that , but hanna &apos;s right .
i love when you say that .
what are you thinking ?
you don &apos;t want to know .
try me .
i &apos;m thinking it &apos;s sunday night
and i still have a lot of homework to do .
creative writing homework ?
okay , you &apos;re gonna like this one when i &apos;m done .
it started out as one thing
and then it just turned into something completely different .
how &apos;d that happen ?
i had this hero , but heroes aren &apos;t what they used to be
so i got fascinated with a villain .
does your villain lose in the end ?
i &apos;m not sure .
sometimes the villain wins .
sometimes .
&quot; down these mean streets a man must go
who is not himself mean . &quot;
you &apos;ve been holding out on me .
toby ?
i wouldn &apos;t say no to a drink .
i need to know what you know .
about what ?
about alison .
how am i supposed to help you
if you won &apos;t level with me ?
i don &apos;t know what you mean .
you know exactly what i mean .
this started out as a job .
it &apos;s something else now , and you know it .
you &apos;re just going to have to trust me .
trust you ?
you &apos;re spread so thin , i can see right through you .
there &apos;s nothing wrong with me .
they help me focus .
that &apos;s all they do .
who &apos;s kidding who ?
thanks .
here , let me get that for you .
i can pay for my own coffee .
it &apos;s fifteen cents . i &apos;m good for it .
keep the change , hon .
thanks .
tell you the truth ,
that &apos;s kind of my way of saying sorry .
for what ?
i don &apos;t like the way our conversation went the other day .
i don &apos;t think it helped either one of us .
yeah , well , sometimes i have trouble
taking constructive criticism .
i perceive it as a threat .
i &apos;m the same way .
have you been back to the hart and huntsman ?
no , not since i saw you there .
maybe i can buy you lunch sometime .
or dinner .
maybe .
well , let me know what &apos;s good for you .
i will .
promise ?
promise .
cross your heart and hope to die ?
the more i see of men , the more i want to get a dog .
too bad there isn &apos;t another alternative .
too bad .
so he just paid for your cup of coffee ?
left a ten @-@ cent tip .
on a cup of coffee ? what a waste .
glad aria &apos;s done with him .
is she ?
you think she started up with ezra and didn &apos;t tell us ?
show of hands : who hasn &apos;t lied about
something romantic to the rest of the group ?
i rest my case .
what do we do ?
you &apos;re president of the man @-@ haters club ,
how would you feel about keeping an eye on ezra fitz ?
i was born for the job .
morning , troops .
aria . how was syracuse ?
oh , it was fine .
you have a good time with your dad ?
yeah , real good time .
did you make it down to the erie canal museum ?
ah , it was closed .
too bad .
so , what did i miss around here ?
nothing much .
well , it &apos;s time to go wrestle the world to its knees .
you really have been to the erie canal museum , haven &apos;t you ?
twice .
fitzgerald art foundation .
is this edgewood 5 @-@ 0139 ?
yes , it is .
and you said fitzgerald art foundation ?
yes , ma &apos;am .
to whom do you wish to speak ?
i thought you were gonna go easy on that stuff .
haven &apos;t you ever heard of knocking before you come in a room ?
i &apos;ve heard of it ,
i just don &apos;t subscribe to the practice .
you learn a lot more walking in uninvited .
those pills .
they &apos;re not going to help you figure this out .
you &apos;ve already got most of the pieces .
suppose you tell me how everything fits together .
i thought you were the smart one .
i am the smart one .
when did that get here ?
i have no idea .
all those pills , spencer .
not good .
almost looks like she could step right out of the frame
and kiss you .
or laugh in your face .
suppose she did ?
step out of that painting .
suppose she was alive , somewhere ?
you trying to tell me something ?
just asking .
not much chance of that , is there ?
men .
why are you asking me about shana now ?
that was a long time ago .
not that long .
i told you what happened .
i &apos;m sorry about what happened .
i &apos;m not asking you to apologize .
then why are you asking me about her ?
i thought about you when i was with her .
i can &apos;t believe i just said that .
that &apos;s what a boy says when he cheats .
i feel almost normal .
maybe i should go .
i &apos;ll go first .
i don &apos;t mind .
you always leave first .
aren &apos;t you afraid people will notice that , too ?
i have to leave first .
why ?
because i can &apos;t stand to see you walk away from me .
will i see you later ?
i don &apos;t know .
lose something , honey ?
hello ?
there &apos;s a blonde package waiting for you .
apartment 3b . you know the address .
mona ?
better hurry up , while she &apos;s still breathing .
you all right ?
never better .
when you put a tail on somebody ,
you shouldn &apos;t trust it to an amateur .
i &apos;m not as used to walking the streets as mona is .
come over here and say that .
mona , how about fixing our guests a drink ?
my own juice blend .
made me what i am today .
i thought you only drank board shorts ale .
when i can get it .
you thirsty ?
not especially .
then let &apos;s blow .
suits me .
how come you had this one to camp out on my doorstep ?
you piqued my interest .
about what ?
you and aria .
what about me and aria ?
are you back together ?
true love honey , just can &apos;t kill it .
nix .
i &apos;m only going to tell you this once .
leave aria alone .
if that &apos;s what you want ,
why don &apos;t you just tell her about me ?
tell her who you think i am .
that should fix everything , right ?
but you haven &apos;t .
why not ?
spencer , let &apos;s go .
i &apos;ll tell you why not if you want me to .
it &apos;s that you &apos;re not sure .
you &apos;re not sure about anything .
you &apos;re in over your head and you know it .
i know what i &apos;m doing .
really ?
look around you , spencer .
look at where you are right now
and tell me you &apos;re not cracking up .
let &apos; em go .
thanks for the buffet .
i want you to know , that was the last carrot stick .
what is it with men ?
why do they always turn on you ?
not all of them .
is it because they wear hats
and the blood gets stuck in their heads ?
i don &apos;t know .
you know , i heard that &apos;s what causes baldness .
hanna , not helping .
well , i got you out of that apartment , didn &apos;t i ?
yeah , you did . thanks .
some rescue team i am .
are you okay ?
i will be .
i traced that number on ali &apos;s list .
it &apos;s the fitzgerald art foundation .
fitzgerald as in fitz ?
that &apos;s right .
and you think ali called that number ?
well , i figure , you &apos;re the one who works at the switchboard .
you could be the one to find out .
so when you &apos;re done with the roll
you take it to the drugstore
and a week later you pick up your pictures .
that &apos;s great . thanks .
where you going ?
delaware water gap . canoe trip .
oh , by yourself ?
no , not alone .
emily said she &apos;d come .
emily ?
i don &apos;t think of her as a tomboy .
she isn &apos;t .
i used to be a real tomboy .
i would spend more time in the tree in our front yard
than i would in my own bedroom .
what changed ?
i don &apos;t know .
yes , i do .
i fell in love for the first time .
that &apos;s when i lost all my interest in tree climbing .
i guess you just grow out of it .
that &apos;s what they say .
i &apos;ll tell you what i know about people .
they &apos;re no damn good .
everybody &apos;s out for themselves .
that &apos;s the simple truth .
if i &apos;m no damn good , why are you talking to me ?
because we have something in common .
we both know what happens
when a man lets a skirt get to him .
he makes mistakes .
walks into trouble with his eyes wide open
and ends up in trouble all by himself .
i have some information
that might help you with all that trouble .
what &apos;s this information gonna cost me ?
consider it a gift , from one lodge brother to another .
alison dilaurentis is alive .
and spencer hastings knows how to find her .
alison dilaurentis is dead .
says who ?
it &apos;s a good likeness , don &apos;t you think ?
he did a wonderful job .
i should have been nicer to him .
ali .
why didn &apos;t you tell us about ezra fitz ?
it makes me angry though , the portrait .
it &apos;ll always look like that , but i won &apos;t .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s smart to disappear ,
you &apos;ll always be the girl in the painting .
that is immortality , my darling .
were you watching ?
did you see him go after her ?
why didn &apos;t you warn aria ?
no woman has ever been able
to warn another woman about a man .
is he who you &apos;re afraid of ?
is that why you can &apos;t come back ?
can i get one straight answer from you about anything ?
and what would be the fun of that ?
i swear , if you don &apos;t stop it right now ...
that is a scary look , spencer .
maybe you should be the one i &apos;m afraid of .
i &apos;m just trying to figure this out .
you have all the pieces .
so why can &apos;t you put them together ?
maybe you need a little more help from those special pills .
do you have enough ?
and what happens if you run out ?
snap out of it !
look !
sit down .
is alison alive or dead ?
she &apos;s dead . everybody knows that .
that &apos;s not what you said before .
i was confused .
confused about her being dead
or confused about telling me the truth ?
just confused .
spencer doesn &apos;t get confused .
spencer &apos;s the smart one .
maybe smart enough to get away with murder .
maybe .
or maybe smart enough
to help ali fake the whole thing .
or maybe she tricked you into helping .
you ever consider that ?
i always thought champagne
was the most sophisticated thing in the world .
well , it isn &apos;t .
you are .
i want to tell my friends , about us .
that &apos;s a big secret .
you &apos;re sure , you can trust them ?
i trust them with my life .
i have .
do they trust you ?
what do you mean ?
i mean , you want them to know everything about us ,
but do you know everything about them ?
do you know all their secrets ?
the important ones .
i bet you ...
i know one of your secrets .
i bet you don &apos;t .
alison &apos;s alive .
i &apos;m looking for mr. willeken .
just one moment . i &apos;ll connect you .
can you put through mr. kane on lockwood @-@ 3 ?
just one moment , i &apos;ll connect you to your party .
listen , mabel , i &apos;m trying to track down
one crummy phone number .
how many favors have i done for you ?
remember those three sailors ?
all right .
so a place like this fitzgerald outfit ,
they send all their night calls to an answering service .
i want to know which one .
terrific .
call me back .
hello .
just one moment , i &apos;ll connect you to the long @-@ distance operator .
so many people in this city .
why does it feel so lonely ?
are you afraid of being lonely ?
i &apos;m afraid of being alone .
i won &apos;t let that happen .
i &apos;m scared .
me , too .
what if people find out ?
then they will be insanely jealous of me .
of me .
of us .
all @-@ night answering service ?
yes , it is .
you can really save my neck .
my boss is mr. fitzgerald ,
and i lost a very important phone number .
okay .
this is from somebody who called after hours
and i hope you kept a copy of that message .
maybe .
it &apos;d be from alison .
could you check that for me ?
hold just a sec .
sure , i &apos;ll hold .
secrets aren &apos;t just secrets .
they &apos;re weapons .
things you keep in you pocket till you need them .
i learned that from ali .
you learned the same thing .
i know something else .
&quot; a &quot; didn &apos;t just come out of the woodwork .
a monster like that , you have to take care of it ,
nurture it .
and that &apos;s just what ali did .
she was feeding the beast with every dirty trick ,
every lie she got us to tell .
it all made &quot; a &quot; stronger .
you know who &quot; a &quot; is .
i &apos;m not so sure anymore .
oh , cut it , spencer .
first it was mona , then it wasn &apos;t .
maybe i know or maybe i &apos;m just looking into another mask .
ali is alive .
who told you that ?
never mind .
she &apos;s alive and you know how to find her .
no , i don &apos;t .
maybe you don &apos;t have the exact address ,
but you know the next step .
i &apos;ve got nothing .
all i &apos;ve got is a book filled with cruel stories
and fake names and bad poetry .
that &apos;s right , you &apos;ve got the book .
and why do you suppose that is ?
since when does the devil give out free samples ?
think about it .
i don &apos;t want to think about it .
i &apos;m so tired of thinking . i just want to sleep .
原文中 &quot; 女孩 &quot; 为 &quot; 男人 &quot;
&quot; down these mean streets a girl must go
who is not herself mean . &quot;
hello .
hi .
you all right ?
if i tell you something ,
you promise me you won &apos;t give me the look ?
what look ?
the spencer look .
the look that you give everyone
when you &apos;re really disappointed in them .
i didn &apos;t know i had an official look for that .
oh , you do .
i &apos;ll try .
i &apos;ve been seeing ezra again .
really seeing him , if you know what i mean .
i think so .
you said it yourself .
i liked jake , but i love ezra .
i do love ezra .
who are you trying to convince ?
well , everything that &apos;s happened with him and me ,
i don &apos;t feel like it &apos;s ever happened to anyone else before .
and it probably wouldn &apos;t have happened to me
if i hadn &apos;t walked through that one door that one time .
it all would have been different .
and who decides what door you walk through , anyway ?
i wish i knew .
it &apos;s been sexy and dangerous and ...
awful and wonderful .
it &apos;s like a story .
it was perfect .
&quot; was &quot; perfect ?
you used the past tense .
i think the story is changing .
aria , there &apos;s something that i have to tell you ,
but i &apos;m afraid i &apos;m going to get a lot more from you
than just a look .
what is it ?
i &apos;ve been leaving you messages everywhere .
what happened ?
i found ali .
here ?
the calls came from here ?
that &apos;s not how you spell &quot; nightly . &quot;
you think that alison &apos;s in there ? why ?
because someone called the number on that contact sheet
from a pay phone in this club .
that &apos;s alison .
hiding in plain sight and doing three shows a night .
it looks like somebody threw a hand grenade
into a room full of rockettes .
this isn &apos;t right . ali can &apos;t be here .
well , this is where the call came from .
did anybody see you come in here ?
we don &apos;t think so .
then get the hell out .
ali ...
i told you not to come look for me .
well , things have changed .
maybe for you , but not for me .
i mean , are you trying to get me killed ?
this one already tried once .
don &apos;t talk to me like that .
don &apos;t talk to us like that .
ali , we want you back .
are you sure about that ?
i bet this one would love it if something happened to me .
that way she wouldn &apos;t have to worry about dropping down
to second place if i came back .
what is wrong with you ?
aren &apos;t you sick and tired of her ordering you around ?
you are way out of line .
am i , emily ? am i really ?
start thinking for yourself ,
instead of letting spencer think for you .
well , maybe she &apos;s right .
maybe it &apos;s time we all start thinking for ourselves .
let &apos;s see how long you last out here without us .
spencer , what are you talking about ?
you &apos;re setting us up for something .
i don &apos;t know what it is , but it &apos;s a set @-@ up .
and we &apos;re supposed to be some kind of decoy for you
and take all the heat .
but you only ever tell us what you want us to know .
it &apos;s always been that way .
and you &apos;re different ?
yeah , i &apos;m different .
has she told you ?
told me what ?
aria ...
split up , go different ways .
get whoever it is to follow us so you can get away ?
don &apos;t even think about it .
aria ? are you in there ?
aria ?
it &apos;s ezra .
don &apos;t answer .
what are you talking about ? it &apos;s ezra .
don &apos;t let him know where we are .
you better tell her .
shut up , ali .
who sharpened your tongue , little girl ?
it &apos;s safe .
you can come out now . i &apos;ll take care of you .
ezra !
i don &apos;t know what they &apos;ve told you about me ,
but it &apos;s not true .
you guys gonna tell her ,
or is that supposed to be my job ?
well , somebody better tell me something .
i &apos;ll keep you safe aria , i promise .
i love you .
no one has ever loved you the way i do .
you can &apos;t trust him .
why ?
no guts .
i think i liked you better when you were dead .
no .
we don &apos;t have much time .
i hit him hard , but i only hit him once .
wait . where &apos;s ali ?
she &apos;s gone . get in .
go .
why did toby hit him ?
ali was right .
none of us has any guts .
you figure it out yet ?
i wish you &apos;d stop saying that .
have you ?
&apos;cause this car is just about out of gas .
so am i.
i &apos;m just so damn tired .
we &apos;re all tired , spencer .
figure it out , so we can get on with our lives .
no matter who gets hurt .
you &apos;re all the time talking about wanting the answer .
maybe you do , maybe you don &apos;t .
what is that supposed to mean ?
maybe you &apos;re afraid of finding out the whole truth .
she already has the truth .
where is it ? in the book ?
where in the book ?
look at the pages .
don &apos;t look at the book , look at the pages .
that &apos;s the same thing .
no , it &apos;s not .
how thin can a sandwich get ?
here , take half of mine .
take it all , i can &apos;t eat .
that &apos;s because you &apos;ve been packing away steaks behind my back .
oh , stop it , will ya ?
i got more on my mind than food .
it wouldn &apos;t be that gal
that beat me out of my breakfast , would it ?
you &apos;re pretty sharp , aren &apos;t ya ?
well , it &apos;s not what you think .
that &apos;s exactly what i think .
we were supposed to find it .
but why give the book back
after going to all that trouble to steal it ?
because now it &apos;s a trojan horse .
look .
there are changes , little changes that have to add up .
like here it says ,
&quot; i can &apos;t stop thinking of ambrose pierson . &quot;
but in the picture i took in the car , it says ,
&quot; i can &apos;t stop thinking of ambrose pavilion . &quot;
what &apos;s ambrose pavilion ?
i don &apos;t know , but it was a big enough clue
that whoever stole this book
wanted to make sure we never saw it ,
in fact that we saw something else .
are all the changes like that ?
yeah , so far .
january becomes march , a cute girl becomes a cute guy .
and &quot; a &quot; thinks we won &apos;t notice
because we &apos;ll think we &apos;re so smart for getting it back .
but &quot; a &quot; doesn &apos;t know that i have the original pages on my phone .
so we have our edge back .
you &apos;re saying that ezra left that book for us to find .
which means he knows we know .
we have to tell aria .
she &apos;s still not answering .
then we &apos;ll sit on her porch
until she gets back from albany .
syracuse .
wait .
just let me try calling her one more time
before we wake up the whole house .
guys .
