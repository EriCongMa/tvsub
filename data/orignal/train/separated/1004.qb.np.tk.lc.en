oh , my god .
sara ? the door is locked .
uh , just one second .
what &apos;s going on ? are you leaving ?
the renovations on my apartment are far enough along
that i can move back in .
doesn &apos;t mean you have to head out right this second .
neal .
i &apos;m leaving . done .
a few hours ago , we were fine .
now you &apos;re walking out ? what happened ?
well , the inevitable happened , neal .
i mean , we didn &apos;t think this was gonna last .
i didn &apos;t know we were a fait accompli .
come on .
this was fun ...
but we &apos;re two very different people .
oh , come on , sara , you &apos;ve always known who i am .
yeah , you &apos;re right .
okay .
i guess you figured out everything i have to offer .
we could be good together .
i know .
neal , you live in the clouds ...
and i live on west 69th .
i never promised you anything else .
i know .
well , you found your way out .
i &apos;ll figure out the rest of my things .
yeah .
caffrey , please take care of yourself .
she walked out , just like that ?
just like that .
was it , uh ...
mutual ?
no .
what did she say ?
that we &apos;re different people .
well , of course you &apos;re different .
that &apos;s what makes life interesting .
what &apos;s next ?
nothing .
nothing ?
just let her go ?
it &apos;s not like we were star @-@ crossed , all right ?
it &apos;s over .
for good ?
for the best .
okay , whatever you say .
morning , sunshines .
any movement from our suspect ?
walked his dog twice .
what &apos;s that smell ?
tuna sandwich .
this half is up for grabs .
pass .
why &apos;d you bring caffrey ?
i brought him for his expertise and his company .
he likes to poke me with sticks .
i do .
hey , why don &apos;t you head out ?
i can catch up peter .
you sure ?
yeah .
you &apos;ve got that look ,
like you &apos;re dying to get out of the van .
you have no idea .
you &apos;re welcome .
thank you .
freeze ! hands where i can see them !
then drop your weapon and kick it over to me now .
now !
easy , easy .
slowly , slowly , slowly .
take off your mask .
look , i don &apos;t want any trouble .
either you forgot to clean up for company ,
or that was quite a fight .
tell me about it .
guy was trained in kali .
definitely a professional .
i was able to get a shot off
that hit him in the right shoulder .
your attacker &apos;s a ghost .
nypd &apos;s got cruisers and choppers searching the area .
no trace .
what was he after ?
that .
guy breaks into an apartment to steal a postcard ?
jimmy a friend of yours ?
yeah , jimmy wilson . old buddy from annapolis .
cryptic postcards from old friends mean trouble .
in my experience .
last i heard , he worked for barrett @-@ dunne security .
private military for hire ?
yeah .
it &apos;s postmarked pretoria , south africa .
that &apos;s a long way from home .
may i ?
yeah .
there &apos;s something under the stamp .
do we have tweezers or ...
yep .
tweezers .
thank you .
yeah .
it &apos;s a microdot .
old @-@ school .
yeah , but all you need is a film camera and a pair of scissors .
break @-@ ins , mercenaries , secret messages .
just another day , huh ?
welcome to life outside the van .
thank you . you &apos;ve been no help at all .
i &apos;ll be up in a few minutes .
lab &apos;s finished enhancing the microdot .
they &apos;re sending it over .
barrett @-@ dunne confirmed jimmy &apos;s an employee
but won &apos;t say where he &apos;s stationed or in what capacity .
all right .
what else do we know about this private @-@ mercenary outfit ?
they make blackwater look like a youtube cat video .
they &apos;ve been linked with rogue kill teams , death squads .
sounds like a fun group of guys .
doesn &apos;t make any sense .
jimmy &apos;s one of the good guys .
what &apos;s the story with the two of you ?
oh , we met at the academy .
he was like a brother to me .
a brother you haven &apos;t talked to in five years ?
well , we served our tours together .
he stayed in the military .
i went on to harvard law .
well , whatever trouble he &apos;s in ,
maybe his wife can shed some light .
isabelle ? she &apos;s here ?
yeah . she came in this morning .
she &apos;s upstairs , giving diana a statement .
that a problem ?
no , no .
no problem at all .
peter .
this is isabelle wilson .
isabelle .
hi .
it &apos;s , uh ... it &apos;s good -- it &apos;s good to see you .
yeah , you too .
uh , so , um , anything from jimmy ?
i told agent berrigan everything i know .
and if it turns out he &apos;s fine , i &apos;m gonna kill him .
i take it you two have met .
c.j. and i were a little bit almost married once .
it &apos;s kind of a ...
long story .
did she just call him c.j. ?
isabelle , this is , uh ...
agent peter burke .
peter burke , yes ,
and , uh , neal caffrey .
hi . agent burke &apos;s c.i. ,
not to be confused with his c.j.
no . ignore him .
thank you for coming in , ms. wilson .
no problem .
so , uh , i &apos;ll walk you out , okay ?
nice to meet you .
look at you .
law degree , fbi agent .
you always were an over @-@ achiever .
and you .
linguistics professor at princeton .
i may have looked you up .
you look good .
you &apos;re not looking so bad yourself .
listen , if , uh , jimmy &apos;s in trouble , we &apos;ll sort it out .
let &apos;s just hope he isn &apos;t .
two months ago , barrett @-@ dunne dispatched jimmy
to shore up security at a palladium mine
they own and operate in pretoria , south africa .
neal ?
i &apos;ve never been near that mine .
no , could you highlight the finer points
of palladium , please ?
oh , yeah . sure .
palladium is used in cellphones , computers , auto parts .
it &apos;s also 20 times the value of silver
and not a bad name for a london theater .
jimmy was sent there
by a man known to isabelle as striker .
she met him once , briefly , but didn &apos;t get his real name .
apparently this striker was bragging
about securing contracts in india and china .
we &apos;ve requested barrett @-@ dunne &apos;s employee files and photos .
but they &apos;re not cooperating -- surprise , surprise .
in isabelle &apos;s last conversation with him ,
jimmy believed the company was keeping a close watch .
monitoring his personal calls , his outgoing mail .
explains the microdot .
that was the only way he had to get information out .
speaking of microdots -- jones ?
this is what our technicians extracted .
it &apos;s a schematic of the palladium mine .
yep .
and this is a schematic of the same mine
filed with the department of mineral resources six days ago .
notice anything different ?
there &apos;s an entire annex that isn &apos;t on the official map .
if jimmy &apos;s pointing us there ...
then someone at barrett @-@ dunne , possibly striker ,
is going to great lengths to stop him .
our best chance at finding jimmy
is to figure out what striker &apos;s up to .
i want a team looking into the mine .
jones , dig up what we can on barrett @-@ dunne .
we need an in .
anything i can do ?
stay close .
what &apos;s going on ?
our patience may have paid off .
d.c. art crimes uncovered a new cezanne
in a baltimore storage vault .
does it match either of the cezannes on the u @-@ boat manifest ?
no word yet .
either way , i want to see it myself .
kramer is sending over photos .
this is our first potential hit off the list .
mm .
if you wait long enough , your thief will make a mistake .
everything okay ?
yeah . staying close .
good . all right .
for what it &apos;s worth , i &apos;m really sorry about sara .
she has an infectious joie de vivre .
and she looks terrific in pant suits .
promise me you &apos;ll never speak at my funeral .
you were gonna have to cut ties with her eventually .
our days here are numbered .
providing we find a way to start selling off the art
without alerting the feds .
yeah , speaking of , peter and diana are up to something .
feds ? up to something ?
quelle surprise .
yeah , two closed @-@ door meetings in as many days ?
i videotaped their conversation .
ah , gutsy .
mm , well , desperate times .
can you tell what they &apos;re saying ?
oh , something &quot; paid off . &quot;
wait . the suit says , &quot; new cezanne . &quot;
you sure ?
or possibly &quot; rue mcclanahan &quot;
i &apos;d go with &quot; new cezanne . &quot;
we &apos;ve got a pair of cezannes in our stash .
&quot; bridge over a pond &quot; and &quot; the mount of saint victoria . &quot;
not good , moz .
peter &apos;s still looking into the art from the u @-@ boat ?
yeah , he &apos;s not one to give up .
i thought he handed the investigation over
to d.c. art crimes .
he may have handed over the partial manifest ,
but he wouldn &apos;t let go of the investigation .
think you can find out what he &apos;s up to ?
i &apos;ll do what i can .
last week , the manager of the palladium mine
reached out to a local reporter .
she wanted to talk about something illegal going on there .
only before the manager could talk , she was killed .
smells to me like a cover @-@ up .
jones , if jimmy &apos;s involved in murder --
peter , he &apos;s not .
i mean , he sent me that postcard to expose the truth ,
not to cover it up .
trust me ,
jimmy is on the right side of things .
only one way to make sure .
we need to find our elusive striker .
he may not be as elusive as we thought .
take a look at this .
barrett @-@ dunne &apos;s hosting a reception tomorrow .
open to invited guests
and all active and retired military personnel .
there &apos;s a good chance striker will be there .
good . isabelle &apos;s seen him , so she can make the i.d.
and as former military , you can go .
okay .
so , you , uh , you want me to ask isabelle to the reception ?
if --
unless it &apos;s a problem ,
given your history with her .
o @-@ okay , guys , look .
isabelle and i met my last year at annapolis .
stayed together through law school .
i chose the fbi . she chose jimmy .
anything else we got to clear up ?
no , i &apos;m good , i &apos;m good .
neal , diana , you &apos;re good ? - about c.j. --
is that a special pet name only she calls you ,
or can we call you that ?
neal .
you asked if i was good .
it was rhetorical .
shush .
i want to ask him . okay , apparently , i &apos;m good .
he &apos;s good . any questions ?
no , no , not at all .
teaming up with my ex @-@ fiancée
to confront a dangerous man to find her missing husband --
should be fun .
peter , i &apos;m in .
good .
you have eyes on isabelle ?
sweet lord almighty .
i &apos;ll take that as an affirmative .
yes , sir .
lieutenant jones . wow .
i haven &apos;t seen you in dress whites since ...
your wedding .
it &apos;s been a while .
you okay doing this ?
if you &apos;re okay , i &apos;m okay .
yeah , i &apos;m -- i &apos;m okay .
the commander coming in --
that &apos;s him . that &apos;s striker .
excuse me .
the commander -- who is he ?
henry van horn , c.o.o. of barrett @-@ dunne .
thank you . peter , you get that ?
yeah . i &apos;m having diana run the name .
looks like he has a couple of bruises on his neck , as well .
you think he &apos;s the guy who attacked you ?
we &apos;re about to find out , aren &apos;t we ?
afternoon , commander .
lieutenant .
have we met ?
i don &apos;t believe we have .
ah , clinton jones , fbi .
how you doing ?
i &apos;m looking for jimmy wilson .
don &apos;t have any idea where he is , do you ?
why don &apos;t you ask his wife ?
he already did .
isabelle .
your husband abandoned his post .
and by the looks of things ,
you &apos;re not far off from abandoning your husband .
jimmy wouldn &apos;t have disappeared without a reason .
jimmy has a nasty habit of getting in over his head .
tell me i &apos;m wrong .
if you &apos;ll excuse me .
what &apos;d you find out ?
son of a bitch owes me a flat @-@ screen .
you &apos;re sure it was jimmy ?
then find him .
he could blow the whole thing .
what &apos;s going on , jones ?
van horn &apos;s leaving this party , and fast .
jimmy !
fbi !
we need to talk .
you can &apos;t protect me .
no one can .
jimmy , don &apos;t ...
jimmy , don &apos;t run , don &apos;t run . jimmy !
why did jimmy run ?
if he turns himself in
instead of pulling a jason bourne , he &apos;d be safe .
the fbi would have protected him .
izz , look , jimmy doesn &apos;t think so .
barrett @-@ dunne is powerful .
he came back to try to expose what they &apos;re up to .
c.j ...
jimmy isn &apos;t the hero you think he is .
whatever van horn is up to in that mine ,
jimmy is a part of .
at least , he was .
what are you talking about ?
after he got back to the mine ,
he started sending cash -- a lot .
how much ?
close to $ 100,000 .
he said it was some kind of bonus .
izz , you know , this is something
that you might have wanted to share with me .
i know . i felt like i had to protect him .
he &apos;s my husband .
how the hell did he even get involved with this company ?
because he &apos;s jimmy .
he &apos;s always pushing to do more ,
to be a better provider .
he &apos;s never stopped comparing himself to you .
to me ?
you &apos;re the gold standard .
me ?
you know , i work in a van . i live under the stairs .
i -- you &apos;re way too modest .
like it or not , you &apos;re a good man , clinton jones .
that &apos;s kind of a rare thing .
hey , boss .
so , good news , bad news on the cezanne .
start with the good news .
d.c. says it &apos;s the genuine article .
dates back to the 1870s .
but it &apos;s not number 9 on the sub &apos;s manifest .
no .
number 9 is listed as &quot; bridge over a pond . &quot;
pond but no bridge .
hence the bad news .
what if , after all this ...
it &apos;s not out there ?
honestly ...
i &apos;d be relieved .
hey , did you get those files ?
ooh . i got it . thanks .
thanks , diana .
i got some news .
peter requested photos from d.c. art crimes .
why would he do that ?
moz .
i think he still has a copy of the u @-@ boat manifest .
our ticket to paradise .
you think he &apos;d keep it at the fbi ?
well , if he suspects me ...
which he does .
... it &apos;d be risky .
but possible ?
it &apos;s possible .
i &apos;ll go back tonight and look around .
won &apos;t that look suspicious ?
i &apos;m a criminal .
we keep odd hours .
you still here ?
jimmy &apos;s bullet came back from forensics .
what do you see ?
brass casing .
nothing strange about that .
look closer .
it &apos;s filled with palladium .
exactly . doesn &apos;t make sense .
walk through it with me .
all right .
van horn personally sends jimmy to the mine .
jimmy gets involved in something illegal there .
the manager of the mine says she &apos;s gonna talk . she &apos;s killed .
and now jimmy wants out
because he didn &apos;t think it would escalate to murder .
or jimmy &apos;s involved in the murder ,
and he ran because he &apos;s guilty .
do you always presume guilt ?
guilty people do guilty things .
am i wrong ?
for the sake of argument ,
let &apos;s go with my version .
fine .
jimmy wants out . mm @-@ hmm .
van horn realizes jimmy &apos;s thinking of leaving ,
so he sits on him .
probably starts monitoring his calls ,
checking his mail .
that &apos;s when jimmy sends jones the microdot .
jimmy slips back into the country ...
and gives me that .
why make a bullet out of palladium ?
high @-@ tech werewolves ?
keep thinking .
van horn said barrett @-@ dunne
had contracts in china and india .
countries with a high demand for palladium .
yeah , but it &apos;s not illegal
to import palladium into those countries .
no , but there are tariffs .
it &apos;s a tax dodge .
murder , break @-@ ins , fake bullets ,
all so our soldier of fortune can save a few tax dollars ?
oh , try tens of millions every year .
glad i don &apos;t pay taxes .
what ?
we &apos;re good at this .
we are .
what now ?
i think it &apos;s time van horn and i
had a little face @-@ to @-@ face .
peter ...
van horn &apos;s on his way up .
good .
no . it &apos;s really not .
afternoon , agents .
let &apos;s see it .
&quot; in the interest of national security ,
all barrett @-@ dunne interviews to be conducted by ,
and scheduled through , the u.s. attorney &apos;s office . &quot;
my friends over there say they &apos;re busy ,
although they may be able to fit you
in sometime next spring .
you got the d.o.j. in your pocket .
you must think you &apos;re pretty special , huh ?
agent jones .
i almost didn &apos;t recognize you
without your best friend &apos;s wife on your arm .
this doesn &apos;t end here , van horn .
not like this .
you got friends in high places ? so do i.
i almost considered having my attorney
deliver the news for me .
glad i didn &apos;t .
this was fun .
come on .
jones . jones , jones .
you know what kind of fun we &apos;re gonna have ?
we &apos;re gonna find jimmy ,
and then we &apos;re gonna take you down .
hmm . i &apos;d suggest using less cologne .
you wouldn &apos;t want jimmy
smelling you on his wife when he gets back .
hey . easy .
let him go . come on . come on ! let him go .
let him go !
you got stones . i respect that .
tell you what .
you get tired of cheap suits and government wages ,
you give me a call .
you &apos;re above this .
so , how we gonna get this guy ?
good news .
we &apos;re clear to wiretap van horn &apos;s cellphone .
how &apos;d you get a warrant ?
i got a friend at the u.s. attorney &apos;s office ,
and i bought an ungodly amount
of her daughter &apos;s band candy .
you can never get enough band candy .
no , you can &apos;t .
i just wish they had something else
besides those damn chocolate bars .
that &apos;s it .
behold --
a copy of the suit &apos;s key ,
fashioned after your chewing @-@ gum mold .
what is it ?
well , your instincts were correct .
it opens a rabbiner 10 @-@ 28 key @-@ lock combination wall safe .
top of the line .
those have only been on the market a couple months .
yeah , it means the suit
recently acquired something that needs upgraded protection .
the art manifest ?
the timing works out .
if he &apos;s hiding it in his house ...
find the safe and crack it .
we have to break into the burkes &apos; .
okay , how about i lure the burkes out and you break in ?
oh , i do the dirty work ?
i have to smile into their faces .
that work is plenty dirty , my friend .
um , do we have to worry about your anklet ?
no , peter &apos;s house is exempted .
it won &apos;t trigger an alert .
if you don &apos;t give him any reason to check in ,
we &apos;re golden .
neal ...
no one said this was gonna be easy .
i know , moz .
and the timing couldn &apos;t be more perfect .
with sara no longer , what &apos;s keeping you here ?
all right , friday night is peter &apos;s poker night .
let &apos;s plan it for friday .
what about el ?
i &apos;ll take care of it .
caffery . what are you doing here ?
we got the wiretap on van horn .
yeah , i heard .
so now it &apos;s a waiting game .
yeah , so , while we were waiting ,
i thought maybe you could use a drink .
come on in .
i &apos;ll get a couple glasses .
okay .
i screwed up .
aw , a little bit .
but you &apos;re a good man , jones .
yeah ?
yeah .
then why did i let van horn get to me ?
mm , same reason that landed me
consecutive 4 @-@ year prison sentences .
what , an almost sociopathic need to tell lies of omission
and get something for nothing ?
i was gonna say &quot; passion . &quot;
mm . passion . but ...
yeah , it makes the world go &apos;round .
passion to get what we want , passion to keep what we have ,
passion to get back to things we lost .
no .
i left isabelle ... for a reason .
which was ?
which was , if we had stayed together ,
she would have been miserable .
she would &apos;ve had to quit her job , move to the city ,
and you know the hours that i keep at the bureau .
we never would have seen each other .
so i made a choice .
to leave ?
to leave .
we can &apos;t have it all , right ?
well , why not ?
why not ?
why not ?
why not ?
why not ?
well , because choices are sacrifices .
and , inevitably ,
that means giving up something that you want
for something that you want more .
so , now i have to ask ...
what does &quot; having it all &quot; mean to neal caffrey ?
never having to worry about money .
um , doing something that &apos;s meaningful ,
being surrounded by people
i care about and respect , you know .
that &apos;s pretty much the dream .
screw you .
screw me ?
screw you .
you &apos;re already living the dream .
oh , come on .
now you are the damned dream with a tracking anklet .
am i wrong ?
well , screw you back , jones ,
&apos;cause you got the same things i do .
yeah , well ,
maybe not the same living arrangements .
am i right ?
yeah .
i guess i do have it pretty good , don &apos;t i ?
yeah .
guess we both do .
expecting somebody ?
no , i &apos;m not .
is this gonna be somebody else who knows kali ?
i hope not .
&apos;cause you just got the place cleaned up .
i hope that &apos;s not the case .
neal .
hey . how are you ?
listen , i was actually just on my way out ,
so , uh , you two have a good night .
hey , is everything okay ?
peter told me what happened .
i &apos;m sorry you got dragged into this .
no , don &apos;t be .
gave me a chance to buy new furniture .
and i got a chance to see you .
eight years .
everything around us has changed .
everything except us .
i should get that .
you should get that .
i , uh ...
it &apos;s , uh , work .
yeah , peter ?
i &apos;m on my way .
what is it ?
barrett @-@ dunne .
they kidnapped jimmy .
i &apos;ve planted evidence all over this city .
you kill me , it goes public .
the murder , the smuggling -- all of it .
you &apos;re bluffing .
you willing to chance it ?
gentlemen , whatever it takes
to get mr.wilson to talk , do it .
i &apos;m on my way in .
our techs picked this up an hour ago .
how &apos;d they find him ?
we intercepted an e @-@ mail chain a half @-@ hour too late .
jimmy thought he was meeting a whistle @-@ blower .
and van horn set him up .
now jimmy &apos;s somewhere inside barrett @-@ dunne .
the place is a fortress .
lots of men with lots of guns .
how do we do this ?
with speed and precision .
van horn &apos;s a killer . he sees us coming --
could turn into a hostage situation .
or he could kill jimmy before we get to him .
claim it was self @-@ defense .
what if we can figure out where jimmy is
before going in with a warrant ?
that would help .
diana , you still have friends in the state department , right ?
yeah , a few .
powerful enough to convince van horn
to take a meeting first thing tomorrow ?
sure . who with ?
a high @-@ ranking naval commander
who &apos;s looking to do business with barrett @-@ dunne .
i poke around , find out where they &apos;re holding jimmy .
we move right to him
before van horn has a chance to try anything .
can you do it ?
i was an admiral .
royal navy .
i didn &apos;t hear that .
nobody heard that .
pencils down .
don &apos;t write that .
you &apos;ve got how it works ?
i get van horn &apos;s security @-@ access card near the wrist pad ,
and it clones the data .
turning it into your very own barrett @-@ dunne all @-@ access pass .
hey , peter , i &apos;d like to lead the team in .
no , you &apos;re sitting this one out .
peter , i can do this .
i &apos;m not sure you can .
i screwed up .
i let things get personal . it won &apos;t happen again .
i --
i promise you that .
as you &apos;ve seen , commander , we &apos;re a top @-@ tier facility ,
in the equipment we provide --
and in the men you train .
kali ?
that &apos;s right .
sorry to run off , but i have business . you can show yourself out .
i appreciate you fitting me in on such short notice .
who am i to say no to the state department ?
i &apos;ll be briefing my people this afternoon .
we &apos;ll be in touch .
access granted .
did you get it ?
i did .
there was a staircase off the eighth @-@ floor elevator .
van horn avoided it . i want to check it out .
be careful .
anything goes sideways , say the word , and we move in .
mr. van horn , your helicopter &apos;s inbound .
get jimmy ready for transport .
then call teterboro
and tell them one passenger for johannesburg .
just the one , sir ?
mr. wilson will be getting out
somewhere over the hudson .
peter , the ninth floor &apos;s completely deserted ,
except for an armed guard outside a room
on the west hallway .
you think it &apos;s jimmy ?
jones ?
it &apos;s got to be him .
blue team , move in .
red team , surround the building and watch all exits .
let &apos;s go .
fbi !
we have a warrant to search the premises .
fan out ! cover the basement !
check all exits !
tell your men to stand down .
tell the pilot that i &apos;m almost --
sir , check your comms . fbi &apos;s on site
damn it .
all right , tell operations i want every radio transmission
in and out of here jammed .
then disable the elevators
and give me time to get jimmy to the chopper .
yes , sir .
eagle to base .
an immediate r6 &amp; e shutdown per striker .
roger that , sir .
and inform the guard outside 907
that he will no longer be needed at his post .
yes , sir .
sir ?
the fbi might hear gunshots .
but they won &apos;t hear this .
boss ?
what ?
neal &apos;s tracer -- signal &apos;s out .
neal , what &apos;s your 20 ?
neal ?
oh , they &apos;re jamming us .
the elevators are disabled .
we got to get up there .
lead the way . ninth floor .
you &apos;re relieved .
striker &apos;s request . come on .
yes , sir .
all right , the guard just left his post .
peter , you copy ?
picked a bad day to break into my world .
i got to say , nothing beats the thrill
of shooting at a live target .
make your move , commander .
did i mention what this puppy can do at close range ?
how about i take your word for it ?
fbi .
lower your weapon . now .
don &apos;t move . drop it .
