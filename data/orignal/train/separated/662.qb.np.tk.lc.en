so charlotte grayson is your sister ?
what are you gonna do with the tapes ?
i &apos;ve gotta get rid of amanda .
but i think it &apos;s best if you go back to your mother &apos;s .
emily thorne , will you marry me ?
yes .
what the hell are you doing ?
the graysons hired that guy who beat up jack .
go to save yourself .
i &apos;m gonna need your old cell phone .
where &apos;s amanda ?
she &apos;s gone , jack .
your mom said david clarke raped her ?
you still want to marry into my crazy family ?
more than ever .
years ago ,
i met a boy who introduced me to a book ,
&quot; the marriage of heaven and hell . &quot;
in it , william blake writes ,
&quot; if the doors of perception were cleansed ,
&quot; everything would appear to man as it is ...
infinite . &quot;
but in reality , our perception is often clouded ...
by expectations ...
by experiences .
as of late , i find my perception is blinded by only one thing ...
revenge .
things aren &apos;t what they seem .
i can promise you ,
victoria grayson had nothing to do with my arrest .
if anything , she &apos;s another victim .
the father of her child is in prison ,
and she &apos;s being forced to raise our baby with the man
i believe put me here .
mom ?
did you see the invitation ?
it &apos;s gorgeous .
you okay ?
i &apos;m just pleased to have you back .
you &apos;re upset about the engagement , aren &apos;t you ?
it &apos;s just an engagement . anything can happen .
what would you like for breakfast ?
i already ate .
well , lunch then .
i &apos;m having lunch with declan ,
the other one you don &apos;t exactly approve of .
but they can &apos;t all be graysons , can they ?
your mother requested white for the engagement photos .
what do you think ?
i think , i &apos;m one lucky guy .
you look gorgeous .
you sure you &apos;re ready for all this ?
well , it &apos;s too late to turn back now .
the invitations are already out .
i &apos;ll see you at the photo shoot .
okay .
six months ago ,
victoria gave birth to a baby girl .
her name is charlotte .
you want proof that i &apos;m telling the truth ?
ask her who the father is ?
good morning , nolan .
&quot; fire &amp; ice . &quot; mm . subtle .
was fire and brimstone not available ?
i didn &apos;t check .
what happened to pressing pause and regrouping ?
victoria told daniel that my father raped her .
that that &apos;s how she became pregnant with charlotte .
wow . she threw a dead man under the bus ?
she &apos;s certainly committed .
so am i.
you &apos;re thinking of going wide about charlotte &apos;s paternity ,
aren &apos;t you ?
just waiting for the perfect moment .
and you &apos;re not worried at all about
how that might affect your little sis ?
one way or another , she &apos;s gonna find out .
i want it to be my way .
you might want to give that some second thought .
last time you had it your way ,
jack ended up with three cracked ribs and a broken heart .
his wounds will heal in time .
i &apos;m just happy that he &apos;s finally out of this .
good @-@ bye , nolan .
all right . just over here , boys .
yeah , yeah , around the corner . yep , just in that room .
there you go .
all right , now careful , careful , careful .
ah , special delivery for my good buddy jack ,
help ease the pain .
what am i supposed to do with that ?
watch larger @-@ than @-@ life porn ,
uh , jumbo &quot; judge judy , &quot;
your choice .
holy crap .
that &apos;s very generous , but we don &apos;t need it .
oh , yeah , we do . i @-@ i mean ,
if you can &apos;t return it , then ...
dec , show the guys where to put it .
look , this came for you today .
i know you &apos;re already in pain ,
so i thought i &apos;d just pile it all on at once .
sorry .
um , i guess , follow me .
all right .
careful , guys .
you knew amanda &apos;s family , right ?
just her father .
any idea where she might have gone ?
no clue .
wait . i don &apos;t need to give you
&quot; the other fish in the sea &quot; talk , do i ?
because you &apos;re basically a fisherman .
amanda &apos;s different .
in her note ,
she said she left because trouble follows her .
i think she thinks she was the reason i got beat up .
i need to find her , tell her it wasn &apos;t her fault .
jack ...
what you need to do is rest .
just rest , buddy .
so ...
fire &amp; ice ?
it &apos;s astonishing how your mother managed
to model the theme of your engagement party
after both sides of her own personality .
you told me to ask mom about the secret she &apos;s been hiding .
well , she told me .
what did she tell you exactly ?
the truth .
that david clarke
is charlotte &apos;s biological father ,
and everything she &apos;s been through
having to carry a terrible secret like that .
wait a minute . everything she &apos;s been through ?
come on , daniel .
if you &apos;re this easily manipulated by your mother ,
i shudder to think what emily is gonna do to you
as your wife .
so the rumors are true ?
grandpa . how you doing ?
i heard you went out and got yourself engaged .
ah . can &apos;t wait to meet the lovely lady .
as one marriage begins ,
i understand , another one &apos;s coming to an end .
dad .
vicky called me .
of course she did .
the idea was to keep our separation discreet .
but what the heck ?
give us a moment , will you , dan ?
oh , sure .
you &apos;re in hot water , boy .
i shouldn &apos;t have to tell you what a negative impact
a hostile divorce can have on our company &apos;s bottom line ,
especially if our assets
are forced into a public tug @-@ of @-@ war
between you and your old lady .
well , i &apos;ve got that situation well in hand .
from what she told me , your life &apos;s in a free fall .
you &apos;re on the verge
of taking a wrecking ball to the grayson name ,
my name .
that is from victoria , i assume ?
your source has her own agenda , pops .
precisely why i &apos;m here .
i didn &apos;t build my empire from the ground up
so i could watch your domestic failure
single handedly tear it down .
it &apos;s amanda . you know what to do .
amanda ... it &apos;s jack .
again .
i just found something that belongs to you .
actually , it looks like it belongs to the guy
whose house you apparently torched .
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;re checking these messages anymore
or if you &apos;re just deleting them , but , uh ...
if you want your tape back ,
you &apos;re gonna have to meet with me face @-@ to @-@ face .
i &apos;m sick of being played .
i deserve answers .
第一季 第十四集
how the hell did this happen ?
how did jack get his hands on that tape ?
victoria &apos;s henchman must have missed it .
and if you &apos;re gonna say i told you so , don &apos;t .
all right . well , what &apos;s on it , anyway ?
depends on what tape it is .
it could be nothing or it could be a pandora &apos;s box .
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;ll get it .
well , you &apos;ve done enough damage .
i don &apos;t want to see jack get hurt again .
what you think i do ?
i think you &apos;re so busy looking down the road ,
that you lost sight of us mere mortals long ago .
the photographer &apos;s ready .
is that the l &apos;wren scott ? it &apos;s perfect .
oh , and i spoke to carolina herrera ,
and she said , she would be thrilled
to make your dress for the engagement party .
i was thinking drop waist , off the shoulder .
ashley , personal question .
are you close with your family ?
not particularly .
my father wasn &apos;t around much .
mm . well , i didn &apos;t know my father at all .
it &apos;s one of my deepest regrets .
i think growing up without someone to protect you from the world
forces you to learn how to survive in it .
well , that &apos;s something we both have in common .
let &apos;s get another light reading .
we &apos;re coming off a little ...
charlotte , look at you .
you know , the last photographs i have of the two of us
are from martha &apos;s vineyard ...
beautiful .
ages ago .
nice .
we used to spend so much time together
when daniel was away at harvard .
what happened ?
the prodigal son returned .
what &apos;s say you and i go out after this ,
just the two of us ?
i already told you , i have plans with declan .
well , then how about the three of us ?
i &apos;d like to get to know declan better , and ...
smooth over any awkwardness between us .
oh , you mean after you tried to bribe him to leave me alone ?
that &apos;s kinda hard to smooth out , mom .
i am trying , charlotte .
i am .
okay , who &apos;s next ?
me . i am .
let &apos;s , uh , cue up a little music .
see if we can get everybody in the mood to get their smile on .
hey , ems .
you know it &apos;s not fair to keep her in the dark .
you need to tell her .
your sister &apos;s in a delicate place right now ,
with the divorce and her father .
this has to be handled properly .
great . beautiful .
but you are gonna handle it , aren &apos;t you ?
because if it were me , i &apos;d want to know .
what hurts more is finding out you &apos;ve been lied to .
okay , okay , the groom .
come over here .
how you holding up ?
better now that you &apos;re here .
sorry i &apos;m late .
grandpa grayson ambushed my dad at the southfork .
apparently , my mother called him .
what do you think &apos;s going on ?
i don &apos;t know .
but he &apos;s always had a soft spot for my mom more than my dad .
daniel , just put your arm around her and act natural .
nothing about this is natural .
then try the other arm .
think about the first time you laid your eyes on each other .
&quot; the marriage of heaven and hell &quot; by william blake .
william blake , the poet .
i know who that is . i took brit lit last semester .
all right . very good . listen .
&quot; if the doors of perception were cleansed ,
everything would appear to man as it is ,
infinite . &quot;
and that applies to you how ?
infinite freedom .
that &apos;s what i want .
i &apos;m weighed down by my father &apos;s expectations ,
my mother &apos;s disapproving eye ,
but mostly by the world &apos;s perception
of what it means to be a grayson .
i don &apos;t want to be limited by all that for the rest of my life .
that &apos;s it . that &apos;s what i &apos;m looking for .
beautiful . great .
what were you thinking ?
i was just thinking about the moment that ...
i knew you were the one .
oh , that &apos;s nice . yeah .
daddy .
i knew you &apos;d come .
well , it &apos;s a family portrait , isn &apos;t it ?
and this is still my family .
hey , i want to take a picture with dad .
great .
in a minute . i just need to talk to your mother .
let &apos;s set one up with charlotte and her father .
you know what ? forget it .
i &apos;m going to lunch .
mom , if you &apos;d still like to join me and declan ,
i &apos;d love that .
i would be delighted .
join me in the study , would you ?
how about we try one over by the railing ?
how dare you drag my father into this .
i was simply telling him about the engagement party .
oh , the hell you were .
we &apos;ll settle all of this tonight at dinner .
he &apos;ll be here at 8 : 00 .
well , i won &apos;t be .
of course you will .
and you will use this evening as a platform
to show that our separation is civil and fair ,
ensuring your father &apos;s confidence
in your ongoing leadership of grayson global .
or ?
or ...
i can make it an apocalyptic showcase
of just how ugly things have become and how much worse they can get .
what do you want , victoria ?
i want you to resume acting like
a compassionate father to charlotte ,
to agree never to reveal to her her true paternity ,
and to settle this divorce fairly and out of court .
is that all ?
for now .
hey , skipper .
what you got ?
you &apos;re an a.v. geek , right ?
you know what that is ?
dinosaur format .
what do i need to watch it ?
well , why don &apos;t i just take it back to my lab ?
and , uh , i &apos;ll see what i can do .
i &apos;ll hold on to that .
jack ...
you--you seem tightly wound .
i mean , i can &apos;t help but notice amanda &apos;s name on that .
a sex tape ?
no . just find me a player .
as you know , grandpa grayson is in town ,
and i would love for the two of you
to join us for dinner tonight .
i would be remissed if i didn &apos;t mention how important it is
for all of us , despite recent events ,
to put forth our best effort
and welcome him into our happy home .
what was that about ?
that looked an awful lot like my mother getting what she wants .
you know what ? this is nolan .
i &apos;ve been putting him off all day . i &apos;ve gotta get it .
all right . i &apos;m gonna get changed .
okay .
okay .
ashley , i &apos;ll be back in a minute .
did you find the tape ?
jack won &apos;t let it out of his sight .
i could erase it if i dig up my degausser .
but there &apos;s no guarantee he won &apos;t watch it before then .
okay , do you know the number that was on the tape ?
14 . why ? you know what &apos;s on it ?
that was my interview with treadwell when i was 10 .
i &apos;ve gotta get my hands on the tape .
i &apos;ll take it from here .
wait , wait , wait , wait . what are you gonna do ?
something i &apos;ve been trying to avoid .
everything okay ?
yeah .
i know you weren &apos;t happy with that photo shoot .
no , it w--it &apos;s not that .
it &apos;s just ... i don &apos;t know .
maybe tomorrow ,
you , daniel , and i can go out in the sunlight ,
do something that &apos;s a bit more us .
that was my original concept .
this whole thing was victoria &apos;s idea .
yeah , it usually is .
listen , i have a few things that i need to take care of .
will you tell daniel i had to go ?
what kind of things ?
secret things .
wedding things .
hello .
i got your message , jack .
i need that tape back .
that &apos;s it ?
that &apos;s all you have to say to me ?
coastal inn , riverhead ,
room six .
we &apos;ll talk when you get here .
bring that tape .
i &apos;m sorry to drag you back into this .
it &apos;s okay .
i was going crazy , not being able to talk to jack .
how is he ?
does he miss me ?
he &apos;s confused and upset by what happened ,
which is why we need to stay focused on the bigger picture .
we can &apos;t let whatever &apos;s on that tape lead him to victoria .
you know what she &apos;s capable of . you &apos;ve seen it yourself .
are you sure we &apos;re doing the right thing ?
what if we just tell jack the truth ?
that you &apos;ve been pretending to be me this whole time ?
he &apos;d never forgive you for that .
they just came in .
hey , wish me luck .
mrs. g. thanks for joining us .
thank you for having me , declan .
it &apos;s like the beginning of a joke .
two graysons walk into a bar ...
well , perhaps we should have a drink before i hear the punch line .
do you have a wine list ?
we do . it &apos;s two wines long . red or white .
how about a bourbon on the rocks ?
yeah , i &apos;ll put that order in with bull .
i &apos;ll be right back .
uh , this is weird for you , isn &apos;t it ?
well , believe it or not ,
there &apos;s more to me than meets the eye .
besides , i think it &apos;s important
to shake up one &apos;s perspective every once in a while .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m interested in yours .
good . well , then can i invite declan
to dinner with grandpa tonight ?
sweetheart , that &apos;s not a good idea .
it &apos;s very important to your father
that the evening go without a hitch .
dad can hardly force a smile long enough
to take a picture with me .
he &apos;ll behave . i spoke to him .
it &apos;s open .
it &apos;s victoria &apos;s pet bird .
she wanted to me to pick up
your list of invites for fire &amp; ice .
oh , well , unfortunately , it &apos;s incomplete .
my secretary is still working on the crossover
as victoria and i are still socially intertwined .
okay . i &apos;ll let mrs. grayson know .
what &apos;s your game , young lady ?
i beg your pardon ?
well , you &apos;re too refined to be a grifter
and you &apos;re too smart to be a lackey .
so i suppose the polite word for it
would be opportunist .
so if it &apos;s opportunity you &apos;re looking for ,
you &apos;re hitching your wagon to the wrong grayson .
oh , i know all about how victoria treats her help .
i mean , you know , she keeps you at bay
and then she draws you in , gives you promises ,
and as soon as you think she &apos;s gonna let you fly ,
she clips your wings and puts you back in your cage .
i wouldn &apos;t settle for that
if i were you .
why don &apos;t you have your secretary
e @-@ mail me the list when you &apos;re ready , mr. grayson ?
did you bring the tape ?
hi to you , too .
amanda .
did you watch it ?
do i need to ?
don &apos;t i already know everything i need to know ?
some guy &apos;s house burns down ,
another guy comes looking for his stolen property ,
which i find in my house , left by you ,
and i &apos;m nearly beaten to death for it .
was i just your alibi ?
that spontaneous trip to atlantic city ,
suggested by you , was that not @-@ so @-@ spontaneous after all ?
what do you want me to say , jack ?
i did it .
i &apos;m a thief , an arsonist , and now a fugitive ,
so call the cops if you want ,
just give me the tape back .
not until you tell me the truth .
why &apos;d you come back here ?
look at me .
was it for me ?
was it for something else ?
you want the whole truth , jack ?
yeah .
the truth is , i &apos;ve made mistakes .
i &apos;ve pretended to be something i &apos;m not .
and that little girl you loved ,
she &apos;s not me .
just give me the tape back .
no .
no , i &apos;m keeping it .
i want to see what was worth
throwing everything we had away .
you need to go after him .
no !
i don &apos;t care what &apos;s on that tape ,
i &apos;m not doing that to him again .
we &apos;re doing it for him--
so you keep saying .
amanda---
stop calling me that .
you want that tape so bad , you get it from him .
i need you to call jack and tell him
you found the equipment to view that video .
he wouldn &apos;t give it back to amanda .
poor jack must really want answers
if not even the long island
lolita could pry that tape from his death grip .
you never told me exactly what &apos;s on it .
what &apos;s the difference ?
all jack &apos;s gonna see is snow , right ?
is this the degausser ?
locked and ready to be loaded .
it &apos;ll erase any magnetic recording .
though , why not just let him see the tape ?
seriously , ems .
i mean , give the poor guy some closure
as to why amanda clarke
added criminal pyromania to her
already impressive list of felonies .
because the only memory jack should have
of amanda clarke
is the girl that i left behind .
is that so he can move on ...
or so you can ?
never mind .
what &apos;s on the revengenda this evening , hmm ?
dinner with daniel &apos;s grandfather .
i hear there &apos;s nothing
grandpa grayson likes less than a scandal .
victoria used my father &apos;s reputation
to explain away charlotte &apos;s existence .
tonight i &apos;m pitting her own lies against her .
forgive me for being captain obvious .
but , uh , you do realize ,
you &apos;re putting your own sister into the crosshairs again ?
charlotte deserves to know the truth .
the question is ...
who &apos;s gonna tell her ?
that &apos;s simple .
our father is .
hi .
hello .
there &apos;s a package in the doorway .
thank you .
hey , babe .
how were your secret errands ?
all taken care of .
come on . i want you to meet my grandfather .
okay .
well , actually , me and my brother own a bar in montauk .
best barflies in the hamptons , hands down .
hello , dad .
there &apos;s my girl .
don &apos;t you look well ?
you &apos;re lying your ass off , but i &apos;ll take it .
i see that you &apos;ve met declan .
he &apos;s going to be attending collins prep
with charlotte this fall .
well , that &apos;s assuming i pass the entrance exams .
and i been working like a dog , but they &apos;re , uh--
they &apos;re a bitch .
yes , sir .
thank you .
listen , i never made it past the 11th grade .
but i started grayson global from the ground up at 22 .
don &apos;t ever let the place you start
dictate where you finish .
right , victoria ?
never .
emily .
emily , this is my grandfather , edward grayson .
it &apos;s such a pleasure to meet you , sir .
daniel &apos;s told me so much about you .
i wish i could say the same about you .
well , in our defense , this courtship
practically materialized out of thin air .
so how did you two love birds meet ?
hey , studybug . settle an argument for us .
do you know who this man is ?
nope .
he is poised to be one of the richest men in america .
but he wants to throw all that away
and become a penniless poet .
now i think he &apos;s crazy . what do you think ?
i think you should ask someone else .
oh , no , no , no . we want to ask you .
i mean , i can &apos;t be who i am and a poet at the same time .
my parents would never allow it .
you want people to see something different
when they hear your last name ?
make &apos; em see it .
be better than your parents .
there ain &apos;t nothin &apos; more poetic than that .
daniel strikes me as a man who knows what he wants .
be willing to make a decision .
that &apos;s what patton said
was the sign of a true leader .
evening , all .
sorry i &apos;m late . i got held up at work .
still kissing up to the boss after all these years , hey ?
yeah , well , it seems a c.e.o. &apos; s work is never done .
if you &apos;ll excuse me .
charlotte , would you join me in the study , please ?
how about a dance ?
i &apos;d love that .
you okay with this , charlotte ?
just give me a second , declan .
i love you .
level with me , vicky .
you think this marriage can be saved ?
come on , dad .
you can hardly be surprised .
besides , you and i have always spoken the same language .
i &apos;ve loved a lot of women in my life ,
but i never could figure out
how to make it last .
well , maybe that &apos;s because you loved too many at the same time .
fair enough .
but i &apos;m 80 now ...
with nothing to show for it .
i don &apos;t want the same fate for you and conrad .
oh , neither do i.
promise me that this is not gonna get ugly .
here &apos;s amanda &apos;s tape .
thanks , man .
i couldn &apos;t have gone to anyone else about this .
lucky for you , you got
the captain of the geek squad in your back pocket .
that &apos;s not what i &apos;m saying , nolan .
you &apos;ve been a really good friend .
probably one of my only .
can i ask you something ,
friend to friend ?
shoot .
why do you want to watch this ?
i mean , if amanda already admitted
that she set the fire , what does it matter ?
because the reality can &apos;t be any worse than my imagination .
what if it is ?
either way , i gotta know .
if i &apos;m gonna let her go ,
i have to .
please . i need to talk to my daddy .
find the lady with the dark hair .
she was there the night they took him away .
he loved her .
and she loved him .
they kissed on the lips all the time .
just find her .
i know she &apos;ll help us .
do you know the name of this woman ?
victoria .
please .
i have to see him again .
采访阿曼达 · 克拉克 1995年11月17日
poor kid .
jack , i &apos;m so sorry .
yeah .
yeah , me , too .
charlotte ...
i owe you an apology .
whatever &apos;s happening with this family is not your fault .
i shouldn &apos;t have taken my frustrations with your mother
out on you .
so i haven &apos;t done anything wrong ?
absolutely not .
no .
if i seem tough , charlotte ,
it &apos;s because i want you strong enough
to handle whatever instabilities
may come your way .
daddy , do you remember when justin fowler
broke up with me at my sweet 16 party ?
yeah . sure .
he was your first love .
and you sat with me for two hours
when my friends were downstairs , wondering where i &apos;d gone .
remember what you said ?
let &apos; em wait .
and you sat with me , making me laugh .
you know , that laugh of yours
is probably my most favorite sound
in the whole wide world .
i &apos;m not afraid of instability , daddy .
as long as i have you ,
there &apos;s nothing i can &apos;t handle .
come here .
there &apos;s my girl .
emily .
dinner &apos;s almost ready .
why don &apos;t you come join the others on the patio ?
this is just a dvd from another wedding planner .
i wouldn &apos;t want ashley to get the wrong idea .
well , that &apos;s so thoughtful .
amanda !
amanda , open the door .
i know you &apos;re in there . please ...
just talk to me .
look , i don &apos;t know why you pushed me away ,
and i don &apos;t care . i just want to help you .
i saw the tape .
i know what victoria did to you .
i know she left you in that awful place .
i probably would &apos;ve burned that house down myself .
please open the door .
amanda ! are you in there ? !
please just talk to me .
excuse me . this is one of the foundations i work for .
amanda .
if you were gonna let jack watch the tape ,
why &apos;d you make me push him away ?
i didn &apos;t let him watch it .
somebody did .
how do you know that ?
because he was just here .
he nearly broke the door down .
amanda , listen to me--
no , i &apos;m done listening to you .
i &apos;m gonna start listening to jack now .
i &apos;m going after him .
amanda--
modern technology ...
it &apos;s gonna be the death of us all .
come on . join the party .
jack !
jack ! jack !
jack !
jack !
and the rain was pouring down on us ,
but i just kept going .
and , uh , and somehow ,
she found it in her heart to say yes .
that &apos;s great .
and daniel tells me you &apos;re independently wealthy .
here &apos;s to small miracles .
she studies cultures all around the world ,
speaks several different languages ,
devotes her time to charity .
well ...
she &apos;s pretty special .
beauty , brains , and a big heart to boot .
you know who you remind me of ?
victoria .
don &apos;t you all see the resemblance ?
sir . excuse me . sir .
you couldn &apos;t do it .
you couldn &apos;t just leave her the hell alone .
jack , i @-@ i--
excuse me , porter , we &apos;re kind of in the middle
of a family dinner here , so--
back off , grayson .
i &apos;m not here for you .
well , if you &apos;re here for emily ,
i &apos;m sure she made it clear , she &apos;s not interested .
don &apos;t push me .
enough !
stop it .
mr. porter , you have some nerve coming here .
i &apos;ve got some nerve ?
what did you say to amanda clarke
to make her leave town ?
don &apos;t be ridiculous .
obviously , you &apos;ve been misinformed .
as misinformed as david clarke was
when amanda saw you kissing him ?
mom , what is he talking about ?
i know . i know you were in love with amanda &apos;s father .
but i guess it was more important to hide that from the world
than to help the little girl that he left behind .
you have an active imagination .
who needs imagination ?
i &apos;ve seen the videotape .
it &apos;s no wonder her life turned out as rough as it did .
but you could &apos;ve prevented that , and you did nothing .
nothing .
if you don &apos;t stop telling lies about amanda clarke ,
i &apos;m gonna start telling the truth about you .
jack . hey , wait up .
victoria , is this true ?
listen , he doesn &apos;t know
what really happened with david clarke .
murder and terrorism weren &apos;t his only crimes .
what happened wasn mom &apos;s fault .
is that the story you &apos;re spinning these days ?
astonishing , the lengths you &apos;ll go to
for self @-@ preservation .
not another word , conrad .
i am warning you .
she &apos;s right . charlotte doesn &apos;t deserve to be in the middle of this .
no , she doesn &apos;t deserve to be in the middle of it ,
but she &apos;s right in the center of it .
and she has your mother to thank for that .
somebody better tell me what &apos;s going on right now
or i swear--
charlotte , sweetheart ,
you said that you could handle anything
as long as you have me .
well , you have me , always .
and it &apos;s time you know the truth .
david clarke isn &apos;t just amanda &apos;s father .
he &apos;s your biological father as well .
no .
he &apos;s not .
mom ...
charlotte !
i will never forgive you for this .
and i &apos;ll never forgive you for inviting that bastard
into our bed .
she didn &apos;t invite him , dad .
that &apos;s not what happened .
no , no , that &apos;s exactly what happened , daniel .
whatever you think you know ,
that man never attacked your mother .
no .
and it wasn &apos;t just one night .
it was an ongoing affair .
no , you &apos;re wrong . mom , tell him .
mom , tell him .
so much for the possibility of a friendly divorce .
well , she &apos;ll settle quietly . i &apos;m making sure of that .
do i have to remind you what happened to this company
the last time david clarke &apos;s name
was associated with it ?
why are you talking to me like i &apos;m the one
who slept with him ?
she did this to our family , willingly .
i am less concerned about her sins as a wife
than i am about your sins as a father .
what kind of a man forces his children to participate
in a charade like this ?
you did when you taught me that perception is reality !
in business , conrad !
this is family .
it &apos;s the same difference , isn &apos;t it ?
if that is all i passed on to you ,
then you should understand why i am suggesting
that you step down as c.e.o. of grayson global ,
and we begin to groom your son to take your place .
clearly , daniel is the only one left
willing and able to stand up for what &apos;s left of this family .
you can &apos;t be serious . he &apos;s just a kid .
he &apos;s older than i was when i started this company !
all due respect ,
you might have brought the grayson name to the company ,
but i brought the global .
all due respect , son ,
i am still chairman of the board .
hello .
jack , it &apos;s emily .
i just wanted to make sure that you were okay .
yeah . yeah , i &apos;m fine .
i &apos;m sorry about the party .
i was just ... so angry .
have you talked to amanda ?
no . i can &apos;t find her .
i &apos;ve been back by her hotel a couple of times ,
but ... other than that , i don &apos;t know where to look .
well , maybe she doesn &apos;t want to be found .
i know you really care about her ,
but you can &apos;t fix a person if they don &apos;t want to be helped .
but if you &apos;d just seen this tape , emily ...
she was just some little girl that everyone stopped fighting for .
i @-@ i have to go , jack . i &apos;m sorry .
how &apos;s charlotte ?
she &apos;s not answering her phone .
she should never have found out this way .
she &apos;s stronger than you think .
i think i &apos;ll go look for her .
i feel like such a fool for defending my mother .
if she lied about this ,
i &apos;ll never believe another word she says .
i &apos;ll come by later , all right ?
maybe she had her reasons , you know ?
so now you &apos;re on her side ?
no , charlotte , i &apos;m on your side .
but maybe it &apos;s not what it seems .
maybe there &apos;s something more to understand .
no , there isn &apos;t .
this is my mother we &apos;re talking about .
charlotte , that &apos;s not a good idea right now .
come on .
look , you &apos;re either with me ...
or against me .
i &apos;m with you , charlotte .
but this isn &apos;t you .
just because he &apos;s not really your dad
doesn &apos;t mean he &apos;s gonna stop being your father .
that &apos;s exactly what it means .
well , at least you still have one .
my father ...
is dead , declan ,
just like yours .
truth is a battle of perceptions .
people only see what they &apos;re prepared to confront .
charlotte .
it &apos;s not what you look at that matters ,
but what you see .
jack saw the tape , nolan .
what the hell happened ?
i &apos;m sorry . the degausser didn &apos;t work .
it &apos;s a relic . what can i say ?
thanks to you , jack showed up at the graysons
and threatened victoria .
now he &apos;s in her crosshairs , too .
thanks to me ?
jack was bound and determined , emily .
and do i need to remind you how that tape
got into his hands in the first place ?
besides , wasn &apos;t it always part of your plan
to reveal charlotte &apos;s paternity at that dinner anyway ?
my way , nolan .
now amanda &apos;s on the run ,
and jack &apos;s more involved than ever .
calm down . count to ten . take a breath .
we &apos;ve been in worse situations before .
you &apos;ll get out of this one , too .
are you there ?
emily ?
and when different perceptions battle against one another ...
the truth has a way of getting lost ...
将应邀出席
emily ?
are you there ?
what &apos;s going on ?
emily ?
and the monsters ...
