what the hell ?
emergency preparedness drill .
oh , no , come on !
yeah , you know how it works .
once a quarter , keep our readiness up .
now , rise and shine , sleepy head .
half the town is probably dead .
i have to get a lock for my door .
i think you &apos;ll like the drill tonight .
i &apos;ve tried to make it fun .
each of these cards contains a detailed scenario
of a possible apocalyptic event .
everything from wild fires
to a surprise invasion by canada .
pick a catastrophe , any catastrophe .
sheldon , canada is not going to invade california .
yeah , really ? you think those hippies
in washington and oregon can stop them ?
fine .
all righty !
&quot; an 8.2 magnitude earthquake devastates pasadena ,
reducing mighty edifices to dust ,
engulfing the city in flames .
the streets flow with blood
and echo with the cries of the wounded . &quot;
oh , excellent choice .
now , put on your hardhat and safety vest .
oh , fun .
i get to spend another night in front of our apartment
dressed like one of the village people .
其中一位经常扮成建筑工人
you make that joke every three months .
i still don &apos;t get it .
leonard ... wait .
what are you doing ?
i don &apos;t know , what am i doing ?
look around you--
there &apos;s hypothetical broken glass everywhere .
really ? you &apos;re going to face armageddon without your orthotics ?
your choice .
uh @-@ oh , hypothetical aftershock !
and that &apos;s why we wear hardhats .
check it out-- press release from nasa .
&quot; expedition 31 will launch this spring
to the international space station .
crew members will include commander tom &apos; tombo &apos; johnson ,
astronaut mike &apos; supernova &apos; novacelik
and payload specialist howard wolowitz . &quot;
this is going right into my synagogue &apos;s newsletter .
dude , if you &apos;re going to be an astronaut ,
you need to pick a cool nickname .
i don &apos;t get to pick it .
the other guys have to give it to me .
oh . if i had one , it would be &quot; brown dynamite . &quot;
are you not listening to me ?
the other astronauts have to give you your nickname .
are you not looking at me ?
i am brown dynamite .
why do you put six sugars in your coffee ?
because the cafeteria doesn &apos;t offer
little packets of methamphetamine .
emergency drill night last night , huh ?
uh @-@ huh .
how &apos;d you do ?
i &apos;ll tell you exactly how he did .
&quot; readiness : unsatisfactory .
follows direction : barely .
attitude : a little too much .
overall :
not only will he probably die in a fiery inferno ,
his incessant whining would most certainly spoil everyone else &apos;s day . &quot;
you know what , i &apos;m so tired , i can &apos;t even think straight .
i &apos;m going home .
will one of you guys give this nutbag a ride back later ?
you can &apos;t go home .
you have to take me to the dentist at 4 : 00 .
oh ... can &apos;t you take the bus to the dentist ?
of course i can . it &apos;s coming back ,
under the residual effects of the anesthesia ,
that &apos;s the problem .
two years ago ,
after a deep gum cleaning , i thought i got on a bus
but somehow wound up on a booze cruise to mexico .
they put you under for a cleaning ?
yeah , they have to-- i &apos;m a biter .
whatever , sheldon . i &apos;m exhausted .
i &apos;m not taking you to the dentist .
wrong , sir .
wrong . under section 37 @-@ b of the roommate agreement--
&quot; miscellaneous duties &quot; -- you are obligated
to take me to the dentist .
see ? it &apos;s right here after &quot; providing a confirmation sniff
on questionable dairy products . &quot;
you know what , i am sick of the roommate agreement .
it &apos;s ridiculous .
i &apos;m your roommate , not your chauffeur .
you know , i had better things to do yesterday
than drive you all the way to the &quot; good &quot; model train store
in garden grove because the one in pasadena
has gotten &quot; too big for its britches . &quot;
well , it &lt; i &gt; has . &lt; / i &gt;
ask anybody .
i don &apos;t care . i &apos;m done .
hold on .
are you saying that you want to invoke clause 209 ?
i don &apos;t know what that is ,
but if it means i can go home and sleep , then yes .
think carefully here .
clause 209 suspends our friendship ,
and strips down the roommate agreement to its bare essentials .
our responsibilities toward each other would only be rent , utilities
and a perfunctory chin jut of recognition
as we pass in the hall .
&apos;sup ?
where do i sign ?
right here .
use your finger .
there . done .
all right . that &apos;s it .
we are now no longer companions ,
boon or otherwise .
we are not merely acquaintances .
to amend the words of &lt; i &gt; toy story-- &lt; / i &gt;
&quot; you have not got a friend in me . &quot;
&quot; you &apos;ve got a friend in me &#91; 我是你的好朋友 &#93; &quot;
i &apos;m gonna go home and take a nap .
yeah , well , tell it to someone who cares .
i got pretty exciting nasa news today .
next week i fly to houston
for orientation and zero @-@ gravity elimination drills .
what does that mean ?
he &apos;s gonna learn to poop in space .
open the pod bay doors , hal .
哈尔是一台人工智能化电脑
maybe &lt; i &gt; your &lt; / i &gt; nickname should be &quot; brown dynamite . &quot;
hello , dear friends .
and dr. hofstadter .
&apos;sup ?
&apos;sup ?
my apologies .
i would &apos;ve been here sooner ,
but the bus kept stopping for other people to get on it .
i saved you a dumpling .
oh , your concern for me is touching .
it will serve you well
when you take me to the dentist tomorrow .
i &apos;m sorry , sheldon , i &apos;m busy .
i &apos;m right in the middle of my addiction study .
i &apos;ve got a lab full of alcoholic monkeys ,
and tomorrow &apos;s the day we switch them to o &apos;doul &apos;s .
you &apos;re my girlfriend
and you &apos;re not going to cater to my every need ?
oh , where &apos;d the magic go ?
sheldon , that &apos;s not what girlfriends are for .
although , you don &apos;t use them for what they &apos;re for ,
so what do &lt; i &gt; i &lt; / i &gt; know ?
howard doesn &apos;t make me do his shopping
or take him to the dentist
or pick up his dry cleaning , right ?
absolutely .
but when ma &apos;s hips give out , you &apos;re up , kid .
well , if amy &apos;s too busy , that gives the rest of you
an opportunity to make my life easier ,
thus assuring yourselves a footnote in my memoirs ,
tentatively entitled you &apos;re welcome , mankind .
all right , then ,
just shout when you hear the task you want to undertake .
uh , dentist .
okay , w @-@ we can circle back to that one .
um , well , who wants to take me wednesday morning
to get new heels put on my dress shoes ?
anyone ?
oh . that one had hoot written all over it .
um , all right , uh , dermatologist .
allergist .
podiatrist .
supercuts ?
okay , okay , here &apos;s a fun one .
um , i need a new picture frame
&lt; i &gt; and &lt; / i &gt; i have a hankering for swedish meatballs .
who wants to spend the day with me at ikea ?
their meatballs are pretty good .
what &apos;s that ?
nothing , nothing .
hello , stuart .
oh , hey , sheldon .
can i help you find something today ?
no , no .
i was just sitting at home
thinking about how it might be nice to catch up
with my ninth favorite person .
ninth ?
you moved up one .
my pen pal in somalia was kidnapped by pirates .
so , uh ... how are you ?
uh ... not so good .
my shrink just killed himself and ...
blamed me in the note .
great . great .
so , what &apos;s new with your family ?
how &apos;s your mother ? is she alive ?
yeah .
and your father ? alive ?
yes .
how about your grandparents , they alive ?
no .
oh , i &apos;m so sorry for your loss .
on a cheerier note ,
i have a teeth @-@ cleaning appointment this afternoon .
what do you say you take me over there , buddy boy ?
i &apos;m sorry , you want me to take you to the dentist ?
yes . now , i can &apos;t make any promises ,
but that &apos;s the sort of thing that gets a fella on the short list
for the number eight friend slot .
sheldon , i &apos;m working .
i can &apos;t take you to the dentist .
also-- and i can &apos;t stress this enough--
i don &apos;t &lt; i &gt; want &lt; / i &gt; to take you to the dentist .
can &apos;t help a friend out in a time of need , huh ?
i see where your therapist was coming from .
ooh , ooh ! what about we make your astronaut nickname
howard &quot; buzz &quot; wolowitz ?
you can &apos;t do &quot; buzz . &quot;
&quot; buzz &quot; is taken .
buzz lightyear is not real .
no , that &apos;s not what i &apos;m talking about .
well , are you talking about when he thought he was real ?
no .
okay , um ... how about &quot; crash &quot; ?
howard &quot; crash &quot; wolowitz .
yeah , terrific . the other astronauts
would love to go hurtling through space
with a guy named &quot; crash . &quot;
all right , um , how about ...
oh , how about &quot; rocket man &quot; ?
that &apos;s not bad , howard &quot; rocket man &quot; wolowitz .
yeah , it &apos;s great , but i told you ,
i don &apos;t get to pick my nickname .
it has to come from the other astronauts .
maybe there &apos;s a way to get them to come up with it .
like how ?
once i tried carrying around a duncan yo @-@ yo ,
hoping the other kids would start calling me duncan .
did it work ?
no , they ended up calling me sock mouth .
because they took away my yo @-@ yo
and stuffed their socks in my mouth .
okay , uh , what if we make &quot; rocket man &quot; your ringtone ,
and the next time you talk to those guys ,
i &apos;ll call you and they &apos;ll hear it .
plant the seed .
that &apos;s actually not a terrible plan .
they don &apos;t call me &quot; brown dynamite &quot; for nothing .
&apos;sup ?
&apos;sup ?
hey , did you ever make it to the dentist ?
not necessary . no .
i found a service that &apos;ll send a van to your house
for a teeth cleaning .
mostly they cater to dogs , but ...
... the fellow on the phone seemed to have an open mind .
all right , sheldon ,
if you need me to take you to the dentist ,
i will take you to the dentist .
are you suggesting that you &apos;ve come to your senses
and wish to reestablish the mutual benefits that stem
from full participation in the roommate agreement ?
absolutely .
if you admit that you &apos;re a 30 @-@ year @-@ old man
who &apos;s incapable of functioning on his own .
ooh , sock mouth &apos;s got him on the ropes .
i will admit nothing of the sort .
and now if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
i have to call my dentist and see
if i can also get my hair shampooed and my nails clipped .
oh , good , your power &apos;s out , too .
why is that good ?
because last month ,
i sent the electric company a starbucks gift card ,
an apology note , and a few snapshots of me in a bra .
power failure .
implementing power @-@ failure protocol .
what happened to all your glow- in @-@ the @-@ dark @-@ emergency @-@ exit stuff
you had painted on the floor ?
oh , that was wildly carcinogenic .
anyway ...
it &apos;s too bad you &apos;re no longer entitled
to the full benefits of my friendship ,
because i happen to be extremely prepared
for such an emergency .
please try not to see anything by this light .
it &apos;s not for you .
it &apos;s just a blackout ; i &apos;m sure the power will be back on soon .
and i &apos;m sure some fool in the donner party
拓荒旅途中因遭遇暴雪被困 发生了人吃人的惨剧
said the snow would stop any day now .
i like to think they ate him first .
you know , i got some candles in my apartment .
but candles ? ! during a blackout ? !
are you mad ? that &apos;s a fire hazard .
no , pasadena water and power recommends
the far safer glow stick .
you call that a glow stick ?
that is a glow stick .
come on , let &apos;s go .
before you go , consider this .
not only do i have a deep @-@ cycle marine battery power source
which is more than capable
of running our entertainment system ,
i also have
all 61 episodes of the bbc series red dwarf ...
and fiddle @-@ faddle .
all yours
if you &apos;re willing to reinstate the roommate agreement .
i &apos;ve got wine at my place and some bubble wrap we could pop .
oh , he &apos;ll be back .
wine and a girl in the dark--
he &apos;s gonna be bored out of his mind .
to wine and bubble wrap .
and to not having to watch sheldon demonstrate
his reverse osmosis machine
that converts urine into drinking water .
you know , in girl scouts , tammie dineesha said
you could do that with panty hose .
boy , was she wrong .
anyway , you want to make out ?
i thought because our relationship &apos;s in a beta test ,
you wanted to take things slow .
okay .
do you want to make out slow ?
i can go so slow it &apos;ll be like there &apos;s a snail in your mouth .
well , lucky for you , there &apos;s nothing else to do right now .
excuse me , leonard .
since when don &apos;t you knock ?
it &apos;s like the only good thing about you .
social niceties have been suspended , leonard .
we &apos;re in a state of emergency .
the world has descended into darkened turmoil .
lawlessness and savagery are the order of the day .
fine , what is it ?
i &apos;m making s &apos;mores .
i wanted to alert you
in case you smelled caramelizing marshmallows
and thought a nearby candy factory was on fire .
s &apos;mores , huh ? good for you .
yes , or good for us
if you sign here
and reinstate the full roommate agreement .
no , thanks . i &apos;m good .
really ?
huh ! okay .
in that case , i will have a s &apos;more by myself .
and then i &apos;m gonna have s &apos;more .
by myself .
no , don &apos;t &quot; aw &quot; him .
he brought this all on himself .
but he &apos;s sad .
no , he &apos;s crazy .
sometimes crazy looks like sad
so it &apos;ll suck you back in .
i think he misses his little buddy .
fine .
but mark my words ,
this frustrating , bogus teenage make @-@ out session is not over .
i thought you said candles were dangerous .
this is a bunsen burner .
i &apos;m a scientist ; i know what i &apos;m doing .
oh , drat .
it took me a gallon of urine to make that water .
listen , sheldon , this is stupid .
i don &apos;t see why we can &apos;t be friends .
and i &apos;m willing to drive you around
and help you out with stuff .
i just don &apos;t want to do it
because of some silly roommate agreement .
what are you proposing ?
that we go back to the way things were .
but when i do something for you ,
you show a little appreciation .
and how would i do that ?
you say &quot; thank you . &quot;
every time ?
it &apos;s not crazy .
counter @-@ proposal .
we reinstate the full roommate agreement
with the following addendum :
in the spirit of mother &apos;s day or father &apos;s day ,
once a year , we set aside a day
to celebrate all your contributions to my life ,
both actual and imagined by you .
we could call it leonard &apos;s day .
i kind of like the sound of that .
of course you do .
it &apos;s about you , like everything else .
oh , thank goodness .
i don &apos;t think i had it in me to make another glass of water .
so , do i get breakfast in bed on leonard &apos;s day ?
no .
can i sit in your spot ?
no .
can i control the thermostat ? no .
do i get a card ?
of course you get a card .
it &apos;s leonard &apos;s day .
hey , guys , the building manager said
the reason the power went out is
someone went down into the basement
and just pulled the main breaker switch .
really .
who do you think did that , sheldon ?
oh , i don &apos;t know .
but whoever that mystery man was ,
you should be eternally grateful ,
for without him , there would be no leonard &apos;s day .
leonard &apos;s day ?
oh , no pressure .
just get him a crummy card , you &apos;re good .
all right , test my ring tone .
that really is a good song .
oh , yeah .
there &apos;s a reason he &apos;s &lt; i &gt; sir &lt; / i &gt; elton john .
they don &apos;t make you a knight
for writing &quot; wake me up before you go go . &quot;
howard , are you coming down for breakfast ? !
ma , i told you i have a video conference with nasa !
i said don &apos;t bother me !
oh ! listen to mr. big shot astronaut !
yes , please listen to mr. big shot astronaut !
hey , good morning .
hey , howard , thanks for getting up so early .
在太空写twitter的第一人
no problem , dr. massimino .
the guys here call me mass .
mass ! that &apos;s a cool nickname .
&apos;cause force equals mass times acceleration .
yeah .
it &apos;s just short for massimino .
anyway , the plan for this morning is to go over the ...
sorry . my phone .
what is that ? is that &quot; rocket man &quot; ?
yeah , my ring tone .
kind of my favorite song , &quot; rocket man . &quot;
howard ,
your fruit loops are getting soggy !
not now !
who &apos;s that ?
my mom . sorry .
no problem ... fruit loops .
