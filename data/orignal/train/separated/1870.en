Surgeons can't be lazy.
The risks are too great.
That one looks like an islet cell.
Which one?
That one. It's all puffy and insulin producing.
It looks like a cloud.
It looks like an islet cell or maybe a buffalo.
The second we stop pushing ourselves,
something terrible happens,
something we never see coming.
I have no imagination, Mer.
Teddy sucked it out of me.
Oh, let's not go there.
We're just gonna believe that everything's gonna be okay.
We're keeping the faith.
Yeah.
She did say that she had something great for me today.
What are you on?
Cabbage patch.
O.B. still? You gotta get out of those pink scrubs.
Why? Bailey's got me blackballed from every surgery.
Besides, it's quiet.
I get to work on the trial stuff.
I thought Bailey told you to stay away from the trial stuff.
I know, but I just can't help it
because I feel like I'm this close to--
Hey!
That coulda hit us.
Careful.
Nice hustle.
You know, I think this is just
more avoiding thinking about Zola.
Did you hear something?
No. I--we've bugged Janet till she's sick of us,
and she doesn't really know anything,
so we just have to wait for the court to give us
a hearing date, and we're just...
Keeping the faith.
Keeping the faith.
Karev, throw the ball!
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Aah! Come on!
Robbins, don't be afraid of it.
Wait. I--oh! Well, it flew at my head.
Not bad. Not bad.
You like that?
I said not bad.
Don't go crazy.
Sloan.
Hey, Sloan.
Yo!
Focus. Hello?
Okay.
Who is that?
Oh, Julia Canner or Kinney.
She's an ophthalmologist from Seattle Pres.
Mark's been... seeing her.
Every night this week.
All right, nice throw, Robbins. That's the way.
Hey, Webber, why don't you come down here
and show us how it's done?
Uh, let me finish the chapter.
I need my energy for the game.
In my experience, we'll need it.
Mm-hmm.
Who's up?
Hey, Hunt.
All right, come on in.
When are you gonna let me pitch?
I'm a really good pitcher.
Uh, we're fine.
Shepherd throws an unbeatable screwball, all right?
Now... little Grey,
Let's go.
Go, Lexie!
Drop the bat. Go, go.
Run to third. Don't stop. All right.
Come on, everyone. Look alive.
Yang, Grey, you--you could at least stand up.
Hi, honey.
Looking good, Chief Hunt.
Hi, Chief Macdougall.
Make it Brad.
I'm surprised to see you out here, Hunt.
We've had this field every morning.
Is this your first practice?
Uh, no. No, no. We've been...
Oh. I would've thought it was.
Kudos for putting a team together at all this year,
what with all the upheaval over at Seattle Grace.
Yeah, well, we've got a lot of good players--
Webber being ousted, all that nasty business
with the Alzheimer's trial being shut down--
No wonder they put a trauma guy in charge.
You must feel like you're just scrambling
to stop the hemorrhaging over there.
We got another half-hour out here or so,
and then we're gonna be ready to kick your asses tomorrow.
Oh, just a half-hour?
Is that all you need?
Hunt, I gotta go.
What?
Lexie.
Yeah.
We got a consult.
Okay.
No. No, wait. We're--
I gotta check on a sick kid.
Can I get a ride?
Listen, no--
I gotta update the boards.
No, no.
Is that it?
No, we're still--
Are we done?
Just--just wait...
Hustle.
Everyone. No, no.
Whoa. Looks like your half-hour's up.
Wait.
All right, guys.
Come on. Let's do it.
All right.
Got it?
I got third. I got third.
You said "Great."
Is it a transplant?
Oh, is it a heterotopic transplant?
No.
But you said "Great." Is it--is it big?
Well, it'll probably take you all morning.
Mr. Felker, this is Dr. Yang.
And she will be performing your angioplasty.
Nice to meet you.
Any first year can do this.
I thought I was gonna be working on a heart.
You're gonna be working on
preventing Mr. Felker from having a heart attack.
I mean, I thought I was gonna be working on a heart
in the O.R.
Hey.
Is someone gonna roto-rooter my veins out?
Mm-hmm.
So I typed it up for you.
Uh, fielding positions, batting order--
It's all right here.
You're a good administrative assistant.
Thank you, sir.
That's not a compliment.
I think being chief resident has set you back.
I'd like to see you getting off the sidelines more.
One, two, three.
Okay, what do we have?
Carl Shatler, sanitation worker, mid 30's.
Fell off the back of a garbage truck,
then hit by a car backing out of a driveway.
Okay, vitals are stable but he has multiple contusions,
scalp lac, and obvious hand injuries.
Okay, Carl? Carl, I'm Dr. Hunt.
Do you know where you are?
Can you hear me?
G.C.S. 10, and pupils are equal and reactive.
I'm gonna need the portable X-ray and ultrasound.
Right away.
Oh, this hand's hamburger.
He's gonna lose some of this.
Oh, god. No!
Calm down.
No!
Calm down. Kepner, where is that ultrasound?
Give us some room here, Torres.
Okay, I just need to stabilize the hand,
and then I will--
I said, give us some room.
The hand is not the priority right now.
Fine. Page me when you need me.
Mm-hmm.
Hey, Karev, I need you to sign these.
What is it?
A-a subpoena for Zola's medical records.
They're transferring her care to Seattle Pres.
Wait. Why? We're her doctors.
Well, it's a conflict of interest
because her prospective parents work here.
That's genius.
First they take her away from Shepherd and Grey,
now they want to take her away from her doctors?
Wait, wait, the file.
You have to sign--
Don't worry. I got this.
Let's see. The patient just flew in from San Francisco.
She has a hypothalamic hamartoma.
What do you know?
H.H. Tumors are slow-growing, noncancerous.
They sit in the hypothalamus--
Mrs. Bayer, can I help you?
No, it's best if I just hold her.
It's okay, sweetheart.
How long has she been seizing?
Well, this is the fourth one today.
It's getting worse,
so please tell me you can help her.
It's, uh, it's tricky.
Charissa's tumor is eccentric.
It off to one side more than the other.
Protocol is a subfrontal approach
from here, but I'd never get it all.
Well, the surgeon in San Francisco said
that even if you just got a little bit of it,
the symptoms wouldn't be as bad.
For now, um, until it grows back.
Well, we'll take any relief that we can get.
I know the risks, and I've done my research.
And you...
You were successful on 87% of your surgeries last year.
So we want the surgery and we want you to do it.
I'd like to try something else.
Excuse me?
I'd like to come in from here,
from above.
I think I'd have a much better visualization
and I think I could get it all.
But none of the eight other neurosurgeons
we talked to even suggested that.
Well, that's because it's never been done before.
Well, what are the risks?
Uh, well, you're passing between two hemispheres,
so there's a greater risk of injury,
including short-term memory loss,
um, stroke, and even death.
No.
I can't do that.
I understand. I really do.
A subfrontal approach is a very standard procedure.
You could probably find another surgeon
who's qualified to do that.
Can I see the list of who you talked to?
Uh... yes, but...
I'd rather have you.
Dr. Samuelson is fantastic.
I don't think you could do better than him.
It was very nice meeting you, Ms. Bayer,
And I wish you the best of luck.
So why did I just have an irate mother
claim that you refuse to save the life
of her teenage daughter?
It was a consult for an h.H. Tumor.
I told her that with a transcallosal approach,
I think I could get it all.
She didn't want to take the risk.
It's a free country.
So do it the old-fashioned way.
There are plenty of surgeons in San Francisco
as qualified as I am to do that.
But they want you. They got on a plane.
I won't do it. It will grow back.
Maybe it won't.
Maybe.
Maybe we should just wait and see and hope for the best.
Yes.
No. I'm not gonna do that anymore.
I had a kid in a crib in my bedroom for a while,
and social services took her away.
And the only thing they're gonna say to me now
is that you gotta wait and see
and hope for the best.
It's frustrating. I get that.
I am sick of half measures.
Not in my OR.
Not today. I can't.
I think you can.
I think her best shot is in your hands,
and so does that mother.
We don't send people home, Derek.
It's not who we are. It's not who you are.
You're right.
Don't send her back.
So then you'll do it?
No.
I'm gonna prove to her my way will work.
So basically what you're saying is,
the device that you put in him is defective.
I'm saying,
You--you got one of the original devices,
and there are some kinks to work out.
So it's a collectible.
When I die, you should just put it on eBay.
For now, the only issue is that you have to resume daily testing--
Because he could become diabetic again.
Is that right?
Because the device is basically a huge failure.
No, it's--it's got some problems.
Which she is trying to fix.
That's why they call it a trial.
Hey, the good news is,
We figured out what was wrong.
And we're trying hard to figure out how to fix it.
Look, I-I knew the risks
when they put this tiddlywink in me.
Plus, all the checkups mean I get to see you more.
Don't worry.
You'll figure it out.
Okay, Mr. Felker. I'm going to insert the catheter now.
I'll guide it up to the arteries surrounding your heart.
Get ready to see a lot of cheeseburgers and fries.
I work in fast food.
So is this all you do every day,
suck crap out of clogged veins?
Arteries. They're called arteries.
I'm more of a renaissance-type guy.
I'm a manager,
but I have to know how to work the fry machine,
man the grill, make shakes.
Hell, when everyone else is busy,
I'm even the guy who mops out the john.
Okay, we're giving you a little more sedation now.
I guess everyone else is busy, huh?
They gave you john duty.
Wow. Someone looks like they got--
they got worse news than us.
I don't know about you, but I'm cheered up already.
I may have just lost my pitcher to a brain surgery.
But--but I'm telling you, I-I can pitch.
Honey, you were a pro ballplayer.
Come on. Tell him. Tell him.
Tell him I can pitch.
I've never seen her pitch.
You're a pro ballplayer?
Well, former. I'm a pro shipping clerk now.
Can you play tomorrow?
Doesn't he have to work here?
I-I-I will hire you now and fire you after the game.
You are now my administrative assistant.
Can't I be something cool,
like a vascular surgeon or--
You can be whatever you want
If you help us beat Seattle Pres.
I can help you beat Seattle Pres.
I'm telling you, I can pitch.
Hey, Grey, I was just in giving the Tyson family
an update on their preemie,
And the mom's complaining of chest pains.
Already called Altman for a consult.
Okay, great.
Uh, did you--have you talked to Karev?
About?
Well--well, the court asked for Zola's medical records.
Why?
Well, it's pro-- it's probably nothing.
I mean, don't read anything into it.
I just-- I thought you should know.
Thanks.
Interactive properties of islet cells?
Is--is that Bailey's thing?
I'm working with Bailey on this.
I thought Bailey was pissed at you.
No. No, we're good.
Okay. Good, then.
Next in line.
Hey. Um, I'm trying to get some information
about this adoption case.
The name is Zola--
Family services.
What?
Requests for information
can be made in writing to family services.
Uh, look, I'm her doctor.
And, uh, they subpoenaed her medical records--
I can't take your files.
Look, I'm not asking you to.
I'm just--I just want to talk to someone about this adoption.
It takes six to eight weeks to process requests.
Never mind.
Next.
Where do I write? What's the address?
This address.
Office of family court services, fifth floor.
Fifth floor. Thanks.
Uh, so CT's negative for internal bleeding.
So Chief Hunt says Mr. Shatler's all yours.
Oh, that's super.
Hey, tell Chief Hunt I'm so grateful
he gave me the go-ahead.
Okay. W-- was that sarcastic?
Sorry.
Um, hey, is there any chance
you need an assist on that hand?
I need more OR time.
Sure. Go schedule an OR.
Oh, and, uh, wish me luck.
I'm about to tell a guy
His crappy day just got crappier.
Considering all you went through,
you were lucky, really.
That sounds like a setup for bad news.
Some of the bones in your hand were pulverized.
Oh. There was extensive nerve and tissue damage.
I'll know more once we get in the OR. and clean it up,
but there's a chance you could lose these two fingers.
Look, I know it's a shock...
Damn it.
But you survived a terrible accident--
Son of a--
Whoa. Holy crap. What are you--
Uh, wh-what are you doing?
Oh, no, no, that's not a weapon.
Um-- that--that's a--
A spitsticker.
I-I do--
I do woodcarving, um, wood prints.
I, uh, I carry this stuff with me
'cause I have a lot of downtime on my job.
I...
Okay.
Um, I'm sorry.
It's just, you kinda...
Yeah. And that scared the hell outta me.
I was just looking for my phone to--to call my wife.
Okay.
Are you gonna freak out if I stick my hand in here again?
No.
Wow. This...
This is gorgeous.
Can I...
Yeah.
Do you...
Do you sell this stuff?
No, no.
Collecting garbage pays the bills.
This--
This--this keeps me sane.
Or it did...
till today.
You might want to leave the room.
She's gonna be pretty upset.
Make sure you, uh, tell her that I'm...
I'm something of an artist myself.
How about now? Any lights?
Yeah. Supplemental motor area.
Great. I just paralyzed the whole left side.
So she's completely paralyzed.
We hit the right side earlier.
All right.
Let's try another angle.
Damn. What was that?
Fornix. Ooh, through to the basilar.
So she'd be, uh...
Mute, memory loss, brain dead.
How's it going?
I just can't find a clean approach.
Lexie, shut down the monitor.
I guess I owe the mom a surgery.
No, no, no. No, not yet.
Not yet. Try it again.
All right, now you're really getting on my nerves.
I'm just practicing my coaching skills.
Seriously, Shepherd. Pick up the damn probe.
All right.
Turn it back on.
Oh. Hey.
Teddy gave me a marathon angioplasty.
Her "Great" thing was a plumbing job.
They've subpoenaed Zola's medical records.
Well, that...
that's good. It's movement.
What are you doing?
I'm gonna e-mail Janet and see if she knows anything.
We're keeping the faith, right?
Did I mention, I can't crack this islet cell thing either?
I've been researching responses all day to an insulin challenge,
and just nothing.
See that, that right there?
That used to be a curly fry.
And I used to be a surgeon.
Janet.
You're right. You keep the faith.
"Dear client, I will be out of the office all week."
I've been picturing her making calls,
fighting the good fight to get me my kid back,
not sitting on a beach somewhere.
I know. Mer.
Zola's probably forgotten us by now.
Uh, hey. Uh...
Excuse me.
Um, I'm trying to get some information
about an adoption case.
I'm sure you'll make a wonderful father,
but until the judge rules a case closed, I ca...
Oh, I'm not the dad. I'm the doctor.
The kid's sick and...
Sweetheart, I've heard every sad story in the book.
It doesn't change the fact that we don't release information
on pending cases.
You know, I, uh...
I couldn't help but notice the dysplastic nevus...
The mole.
What?
Yeah, anyone ever check that for you?
Yes, but...
They said it's not dangerous.
Not now anyway.
Me? I wouldn't take that chance.
Oh, right. Crappy government insurance.
That would be on the deductible.
Hey, look, I'm a surgeon.
You give me the stats on this kid,
I'll take care of you for free.
Yeah, she's on Judge Brentner's docket.
Let's see if, uh...
Oh, wait. He's not even here today.
He's getting chemo.
So sad. Prostate.
Hey, you're a doctor. Is that one of the bad ones?
Mm, not necessarily.
Depends on where he's getting it treated.
It could be postpartum cardiomyopathy.
I'll transfer her to telemetry.
Okay.
Hey, Dr. Altman.
Why is Cristina doing an angioplasty?
Excuse me?
I was just wondering, and I know she was, too.
Is... is this all going somewhere?
I mean, I know it's none of my business, but...
You're right.
As a first year,
you do an angio to learn a technical skill,
but an angio as a fifth year is about learning respect.
Respect for the heart disease
that Cristina will see for the rest of her career.
It all starts there, in the artery.
You have to go back to the beginning
to understand the end.
Back to the beginning.
All right, so move Avery to shortstop
and put Bailey in center field.
Bailey? Why Bailey?
Well, because Bailey's a leader.
She'll know who to get the ball to.
She's not your cutoff man. Avery, he's your cutoff man.
She's tall. Where do you have her?
Uh... left field.
Can she catch?
Uh, let's find out.
Grey, catch.
Hunt, what the hell?
Now he's your cutoff man.
Yeah.
I've been looking for you.
I need my mother's journals.
Why? What's up?
Well, I need to see her original hypothesis.
If I'm gonna figure out what's going on,
then I need to start where she started.
I knew once you picked it up, you couldn't put it down.
Don't gloat. Where are they?
Come on.
Nice.
The patient and her mother are wondering
if she's having surgery today.
Should I tell them that you are still working?
We are working.
Sometimes the body thinks better than the brain.
Grey, toss him a ball.
Hello. Yeah. Yeah.
I thought the board meeting would be pushed to Thursday.
Oh, your swing's too high.
Did you play ball?
Yeah. I was a pitcher.
Really?
Yeah.
Right, into the parking...
Mark's in love.
Oh, with an eye doctor.
That should last 48 hours.
Yeah, well, I should be happy for him.
Don't worry about.
Just shake it off or shake it out
or I don't know, shake something.
It's his new coaching persona.
I'm still work on it.
You are still coming out of wrong.
You are pounching the ball wrong.
I'm holding the bat wrong?
No, no. Not the bat. It's your body.
You need to adjust your head.
Drop your shoulder.
You are not connecting.
The head is in the wrong angle.
I need to adjust it properly.
You need to adjust the angle of the head.
I went back to the lab to test my approach.
There's a very good shot
I can access the tumor from above.
I think we can get it all.
A good shot?
This is my child.
Well, there are risks either way,
uh, but this certainly has more risks.
So she could die in surgery.
Look, thank you for trying, Dr. Shepherd, but I...
I can't let my little girl be your guinea pig.
Mrs. Bayer,
now in all your research,
have you ever found a story of a kid with an H.H. tumor,
whoever got better...
whoever got a job,
had a life?
This is the best shot you'll have.
Altman. Sloan, you're on first.
Oh, Bailey, you're center field.
We're doing some shuffling.
What are you doing here?
I work here.
Uh, I may not even make the game.
I got 49 trial patients left to call.
I gotta give them the same bad news I gave you.
Ouch. That's rough.
We need a sub for center field.
Yeah. Uh, Shepherd, pitcher.
Shepherd's out.
He told me his brain surgery could be a marathon.
Oh! Me. Let me pitch.
Okay.
All right, Altman, pitcher.
Yes.
Sloan, first.
Shepherd can be a pinch hitter.
Okay, Torres, you're on...
I need you to sign for this.
Bone plates and titanium mesh? That's a lot of hardware.
I thought you said this guy's hand wasn't salvageable.
Yeah, well, I'm gonna try and rebuild it.
It's gonna be really cool. April, meet me in the O.R.
I need a small.
Oh, they're all larges.
What?
No. We can't be out of smalls already.
I told them we needed an assortment of sizes.
I... I was very clear on the phone.
Sweet.
I'll look fantastic in this.
And when you look good, you play good.
Am I right, Avery?
You know it.
What the hell was that?
What?
What, are you guys pledging delta chi together?
No, Sloan's pretty cool, actually.
He's, uh, been in such a good mood lately,
he's letting me do half his procedures.
He let me run the burn center last night.
Neat.
Okay, Grey, you're, uh...
Winning is an attitude.
We're winners.
Yeah.
Okay, so this
will hold his hand in place
so I can see the tendon and nerve gaps, and...
What the chief doesn't realize is that a lot of the work I do
makes it possible for these surgeries to take place.
I mean, all the...
all the staffing and scheduling, I...
I mean, so maybe...
Okay, maybe I'm not in the O.R. all the time...
April.
But I...
Do you want to be an administrative assistant?
Is that what makes your heart sing?
No, of course not.
Then stop being a whiner.
Stop hiding behind paperwork.
If you love it, do it. Just get in the O.R.
Okay? Don't sleep, don't eat.
Just do this.
Here.
You want me to place the K-wire?
Will it make your heart sing?
Yes. Yeah, right.
Okay, placing the wire.
Okay. Oh, you're a little too far to the left.
Okay, I got it. Sorry.
There you go. Right there. Good. That's all right.
I didn't do anything. I swear.
Damn it.
No, just stop. What's going on?
I don't know, but his pressure's tanking.
I'm hanging blood.
It looks like electrical alternans.
He's tamponading.
What the hell? Page cardio.
These things I need done. Is that okay?
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Thank you. Thank you.
Sorry.
What is that?
Uh, my mom's journal.
No, I know what it is. Why do you have it?
Because it's my mom's journal.
Freeze it. Intraluminal flap and pericardial effusion.
Damn it. He's got a dissection.
That's why he fell.
It must have started when he was on the truck.
He probably passed out.
Oh, God. Uh, we need to get Altman.
Why? Do we need to go--
Yes, we need to open him right now.
Um, April, start the thoracotomy.
What? Me? What-- what are you doing?
Getting gowned and gloved. Crack his chest.
But I--I'm assisting.
It's all right. I got this.
Go do your thing.
But I've never done an aortic dissection.
April, crack his chest now.
Um, 10-blade.
Here you go, doctor.
Thank you.
Okay, here's the tear.
Okay, open the aorta longitudinally.
Now transect proximal to the innominate artery.
Are you sure you don't want to do this?
You're already there.
All right. What do we have?
A thoracic aortic dissection.
Uh, Kepner excised the defect
and he's going to need a graft.
All right. Let me get scrubbed.
You'll first assist.
Torres, can you clear out?
Can you work around me?
Uh, I mean, I'd--I'll move if I have to, but--
Torres, I'm trying to--
I know,
but trust me, I'm saving his life, too.
Can you work around me?
Fine.
Yang, why didn't you just start the graft?
I didn't need to. Kepner had it.
Okay.
I've got some of it,
but I need to change the angle to get the rest of it.
Okay, let's release the Mayfield, please.
I need you to hold the probe steady
so I can adjust the angle.
You're not taking it out?
It's too risky.
If we go outside of the track,
we could hit healthy brain tissue.
Come on. Take the probe.
Hold it still.
Move it even 1 millimeter, it's over.
Ready? Let's give it a whirl.
Okay, good. I think...
the tumor's dropped into the field.
Let's tighten the device.
Okay. Good job.
Okay, let's start the aspiration.
Very slowly.
Go ahead.
Heart rate's 130. What's happening?
The tumor is pulling on the hypothalamus.
Push 20 of labetalol, please.
Grey, hold the retractor.
Let me take this.
Heart rate's 160.
Ah, damn it. I'm pulling out the probe.
But you just said we're not g--
No, we don't have a choice.
Well, what do we do now? There's still tumor left.
We try again.
Why didn't you just start the graft yourself?
Why'd you wait?
Is this a trick question?
No. I'm asking.
Oh, come on.
Now I'm in trouble for waiting for you?
You would've ripped me a new one if I did it myself.
Two months ago, you would've bodychecked Kepner
in order to get into this guy's chest,
and now you let her just do the surgery?
And you don't even like Kepner.
This is true.
Uh, yes, I could've done it myself,
but she had it.
Exactly.
I'm done here.
Okay, then could you girls take it outside?
Some of us have a long way to go.
I give up.
I have no idea what you're trying to do.
I am in trouble if I cut. I'm in trouble if I don't cut.
I'm a fifth year
who does the work of an intern.
What do you want?
I want you to make a list.
Okay, where, uh, on a blackboard?
"I will not do any surgeries without a safety helmet."
I want you to make a list of every surgery
that you have ever dreamed of performing.
Shoot for the moon, and I will try to get you some.
Because we're done.
You've graduated. This is your present.
You're messing with me.
All right, you know, at-- at the beginning of this year,
you nearly killed Alex Karev in that o.R.
because you just had to get in there,
you had to be the best, and you had to be first.
But today...
today I saw a different surgeon--
every bit as good,
every bit as advanced,
but you were willing to work on a team.
Today...
you put the patient before yourself.
And that...
is who I wanted to see.
So...
you're done.
Make a list.
What...
What the hell are you doing in here?
One second.
In a second, I'm-a kick you in your...
I just need to see if the cell survived.
Yes! Yes! The cell survived.
What are you talking about?
My mom was wrong. It's oxygen.
The cells aren't getting enough oxygen.
She extrapolated the amount delivered
based on tests with mice,
but the internal structure of an islet cell of a mouse
is completely different than that of a human.
Her hypothesis was wrong.
That's why the islet cells in your device are dying.
I marked the page for you.
You mean it's gone? You got it all?
Yes, we won't know where we are for a couple of days...
But yeah, I-I did. I-I got it all.
Wait. So--so what?
So--so no more seizures, and she won't freak out anymore?
Well, she is a teenager, so chances are she might.
Yeah, but not because of the tumor.
The fingers...
They're all there.
I had to build you a new skeletal framework,
Jerry-rigged some, uh, wire through these bolts here,
but, um... yeah, saved your hand.
Will it work?
It should.
There'll be some follow-up surgery and physical therapy--
A lot of physical therapy--
But you should regain full mobility.
I...
It's beautiful.
Thank you.
See?
I told you she was an artist.
Uh, Mr. Brentner?
Yes?
How am I doing?
Uh, well, uh, someone will--
B-be in to speak with you shortly.
Look, I'm sorry to bother you,
but I need to talk to you about something else.
You have a kid on your docket-- Zola.
She's from africa--
I-I'm sorry, but I can't discuss a case--
Look, just hear me out.
I'm--I'm Zola's doctor.
She's got spina bifida.
Two doctors want to adopt her. They're just waiting to hear.
But for weeks now,
she's been stuck in a foster home.
This is highly inappropriate.
A sick kid like that shouldn't be with a foster family.
She needs to be in a stable home
with good parents-- these parents.
Without that, she's only gonna get worse.
Excuse me. Nurse?
I need--
I'll be right with you.
Don't bother. I'm leaving, okay? I'm leaving. Just...
All I'm asking for you to do is to take a look at this case.
That's it.
Please just... take a look.
Doctor.
Attempting to influence a judge
is a federal offense.
Come on! Knock it out!
Come on! Let's go, Shepherd!
Yeah!
Get it!
All right. All right. All right,
Karev, you're on second.
Let's get out there and get it back.
We can do it.
We are down 8-nothing.
We're screwed.
He should just call it now.
The new chief's got something to prove.
Hey, hey. You still got your...
Yeah.
Aw, yeah.
All right, come on,
Brisman! You can do it!
Come on, dude! Ring it up!
Here we go! Here we go!
Hit it out of the park! Hit it out of the park! That's right!
Ah, he's got it. He's got it.
All right. Yeah, you do!
Go! Oh, yeah!
Keep your eye on it. Here we go!
Get the walk!
Off-pump quintuple CABG.
Do you have a pen?
What are you doing?
I'm making a list.
Teddy told me to make a bucket list of surgeries.
I kept the faith, Mer.
Who thought that would pay off?
Here!
It's not paying off for me.
My faith is currently out of the office.
Maybe I cured diabetes, though.
Your mom would've been proud.
No, she wouldn't probably not.
Oh, God.
Here we go.
Show 'em your stuff.
Seriously?! Really?!
You want to pitch?
Whoa. Hey.
What are you doing out here?
I'm a roving outfielder. I'm, uh, I'm roving.
I'm roving. I'm...
Yes! Yes!
Oh, my god! It's coming here! Oh!
Oh, I got it! I got it!
Get it! Get it! Get it! I got it!
Ball hog!
I had that.
Oh, did you?
Or were you gonna let it fall to the ground again?
What is your problem with me?
I beg your pardon?
I don't want on your stupid trial.
I just need to get it out of my head.
Uh, no, Mer--
Are you drunk?
She is. We are.
So what is your problem?
What is my problem?
All right, I'll tell you my problem.
My problem is you.
Everywhere I look, you're all in my trial,
coming in my lab, opening my doors...
What's going on out there?
I'm not sure.
Time-out.
I got this, Hunt.
C-can he do that?
He seems to think he can.
Oh, this must be pretty humiliating for you.
Yeah, you're gonna look so hot
when you get tagged out at home plate.
Oh, in your dreams.
God, get a room.
It's disgusting.
Give the guy a break.
She's on the opposing team.
So what? He seems happy.
He's happy, I'm happy.
And you and me, we're-- we're happy, right?
Oh, what is with the friggin' holdup? Let's play ball!
You are reckless and irresponsible--
But it was between me and the chief and my husband,
So mind your own damn business! Ah!
You are not the boss of me.
Oh, thank god for that. Will--
We're lucky to even be able to have a trial after you--
Shut up! The both of you.
Now you...
You have a lot of nerve,
rubbing Meredith's nose in her mistakes
when you can't fix your own.
Your trial is failing.
Like it or not, you need her.
And you, even your mom,
the great Ellis Grey, made a mistake.
You fixed hers. Now fix your own.
Get out of those ridiculous pink scrubs
and get back to the work you were born to do.
Now the two of you are gonna figure out a way to work together,
but you're not gonna do it on this field.
You'll do it monday morning in the lab. Is that clear?
Yes.
Mm-hmm.
Play ball!
We playing ball. Playing ball.
All right. Yes!
Well, that's, uh, that's gonna make it 12-nothing.
Uh, how long are we gonna let this go on for?
She'll get there.
If she can just get a better drive off the mound--
She's terrible.
Yeah, she sucks.
Oh. Want to call it, Hunt? Team's looking a little tired.
Wouldn't want anyone napping in the O.R.
The last thing you guys need is a malpractice suit.
All right. We're pulling the pitcher.
Shepherd, get your glove.
No, no, not me. Lexie...
Get your glove. Run out there.
Wow. Great job, hon.
You threw a really good game.
Come on. Let's--let's go ice your shoulder, huh?
Oh, no. I'm--I'm just warming up. Get outta here.
Come on. Hey, there's beer.
Now come on.
No. Let me-- let me try again.
Honey, we're running out of time.
No, no way. We got like-- like five more innings.
No, I'm running out of time.
Is this really how you want to spend
our last few moments together?
Give me the ball. I can--I can feel my device failing.
Come on.
I hate you so much.
I know.
All right, all right.
Time-out. Time-out. Everybody--
You just took a time-out.
Another one?
Are you kidding me?
Bring it in. Huddle up.
All right.
I...
I just want to say how proud I am of all of you.
You are an incredible team.
Now who's drunk?
Get off.
I've watched you work together, uh,
solve problems together.
I watched you teach each other and learn from each other.
You... step up when you need to.
And you...
You do more than anyone asks you to do.
You're the finest team I've ever been a part of.
Oh, my god. What are you talking about?
That's really sad.
Beautiful.
You don't think we actually have a shot at winning this.
What, this? This? No, no, no, we're screwed.
You are all horrible at softball.
But as doctors,
you're pretty great,
and I am proud just to get to lead you,
and you're all here, so I just...
I just wanted to tell you.
But now...
Now we're going down.
So what doou say we go down fighting?
Yes!
One, two, three.
Go, team!
Whoo! Yeah!
All right! Here we go. Here we go.
All right. Come on, guys!
Let's go, Lexie!
You can do this!
Come on! Here we go!
Good game.
Good game.
Let's go, Lexie!
Good game.
Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on!
Spread out!
There it is.
Oh, no arm! No arm.
This is your relief pitcher?
Hey, my grandma's not busy.
She can pitch better than that.
Oh! Right in the boob.
Lexie!
What? I thought she was stealing second.
For the love of god!
She's a surgeon, Hunt. That could've been her hand.
I'm calling it!
Whoa. So--okay.
So you're--you're-- you forfeit?
No, we killed you. Game over!
You forfeit. That was a forfeit.
So we may not always be winners.
But we're not lazy.
We take chances.
We go for broke.
We swing for the fences.
And sometimes, yeah,
we strike out.
Well, thank you guys for, uh, letting me be your ringer.
Although, I didn't really ring much.
It was more like a thunk, but...
All right, will you take me home?
I will take you home.
Well, come on. We've got Mark as a sitter, so...
I'm taking you home.
His girlfriend's gonna be okay, right?
Ah, it's her boob.
She's in good hands.
Are you gonna tell me what that was about or what?
Yeah, I thought she was stealing second.
No, you didn't.
I think I hear my heart singing.
Can you hear that?
Listen. La...
Are you drunk?
Yeah, I'll give you a ride home.
Be in the lab before rounds.
I will.
Good job, Chief.
You made it through four innings.
Two more than any team I've ever fielded.
Can I do a heterotopic transplant?
Tonight? No.
Good call.
You're a good chief.
Come on.
Good night.
I'm good. You're fine, too.
That was a massacre.
Yeah.
I don't think we did that bad.
Oh, yeah.
Where were you yesterday?
I was, uh, doing stuff.
Why do you look so sad?
Don't be so sad. Look.
I just got a message from Janet.
I guess the judge got in touch with her.
He's looking at Zola's files. We're gonna get a court date.
We're getting a hearing?
We have a hearing.
We got a hearing.
We're getting a hearing.
Oh, come on.
But sometimes,
