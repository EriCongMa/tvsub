you weren &apos;t an easy man to find , sato .
you should have left this alone .
where is he ?
where is adam noshimuri ?
we know you took him .
you know nothing .
i know that if i pull this trigger , there &apos;s a bullet that &apos;s
gonna travel at 1,200 feet per second ,
blowing a hole the size of baseball in your brain ,
killing you in a matter of milliseconds .
now , taking that into account , i &apos;m gonna ask you again ,
where is adam ?
you &apos;ll never see him again .
you killed him ?
is he dead ? !
is he dead ? !
if it was up to kono , she &apos;d put a bullet in you right now ,
but we &apos;re gonna do this the right way .
you &apos;re gonna confess to adam &apos;s murder .
what do you want me to say ?
the truth-- you killed him .
i wanted adam dead ...
but out of respect for his father , i let him go .
you &apos;re lying .
am i ?
i helped adam fake his death so he could disappear .
if he &apos;s smart , he &apos;ll never show his face again .
if you are smart ,
you &apos;ll let this go .
yeah , copy that .
all right , steve and catherine took sato to the drop point .
they &apos;ll meet us at the plane .
i &apos;m not going with you , chin .
adam &apos;s alive .
i &apos;m gonna go find him .
michael noshimuri &apos;s allies think adam is dead .
you don &apos;t have to run anymore .
but if you go trying to look for him ,
you both become targets again .
you once told me to follow my heart .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m gonna go do .
just be careful , all right ?
i will .
thank you .
how old is he now ?
okay . no , that sounds about right .
just relax . relax !
hey , let him have his fun , okay ?
i &apos;ll talk to you later .
let me guess : danny &apos;s father bought
himself a porsche for his 60th birthday .
corvette .
oh , sweet ! nice .
a little late for a midlife crisis , isn &apos;t it ?
yo . what , did you forget to tell me how much you miss me ?
i , uh , no , i thought it was detective williams .
yes , sir .
absolutely , governor , i &apos;ll be right there .
you first .
now you .
samantha ?
oh , no .
what &apos;s wrong ?
hey , daddy .
why aren &apos;t you ready for school ?
alarm clock didn &apos;t go off .
dad !
hey , um ... good morning , mr. grover .
i &apos;ve got your face now , boy .
you better get your ass to school .
dad !
&quot; dad ! &quot; don &apos;t &quot; dad &quot; me .
you &apos;re lucky i don &apos;t have him arrested .
something like this gets out on the internet , samantha ,
it can follow you for the rest of your life .
oh , my god , you &apos;re overreacting !
i like him !
hey , i need that for school !
use a pencil . it worked for me .
i got a meeting to go to .
and when i come back , we &apos;re gonna discuss your punishment .
you still owe me an apology .
not gonna happen .
yeah , why am i not surprised ?
why would you be surprised ?
lieutenant kelly told me about that stunt
you pulled at the coffee shop .
hey , i was just trying to tell your man
that working with you is a quick way to die .
you threaten my team &apos;s safety again ,
you watch what happens . you understand ?
hey , man , don &apos;t you ever pull a gun on me again .
you think i &apos;m just gonna forget about that ?
we went through that !
i either took down swat
or let catherine rollins die .
and i said there &apos;s always another option .
but i guess that &apos;s just your thing :
you just do whatever the hell you want .
you don &apos;t like me , do ya , huh ? !
that &apos;s right !
guess what ? that &apos;s all ...
gentlemen !
yeah ?
yeah ?
the governor &apos;s waiting .
all right , who wants to go first ?
uh ... sir ? - excuse me ?
let &apos;s cut to the chase , gentlemen .
what i have here is a complaint
filed by the head of swat against the head of five @-@ o.
what the hell is going on ?
you filed a complaint against me ?
you brought that on yourself , man .
governor , please , this @-@ this ,
the complaint was filed in confidence .
steve , put that down .
&quot; volatile . arrogant . out of control . &quot;
&quot; irresponsible and reckless behavior
that puts the public at risk . &quot;
see what i &apos;m saying ?
&quot; a danger to himself and others &quot; &quot;
you son of a bitch .
steve , enough !
i &apos;m tossing the complaint .
you ...
starting right now , slate &apos;s clean .
this is more than just a complaint ! it &apos;s a problem !
this is about the complete lack of accountability
that allows this man &apos;s behavior to go unchecked !
don &apos;t tell me how to do my job , captain !
look , i have a full schedule
and i don &apos;t have time to play principal .
this is a small island .
i expect you to play nicely together in our sandbox . understood ?
yes , sir .
steve ?
yes , sir .
sit down .
very good .
from this moment forward , you will get along .
and to start you off on the right foot ,
you two are gonna serve a warrant together .
a 21 @-@ year @-@ old up in waimanalo has failed
to pay several parking tickets .
i want you to bring this man to the courthouse ,
make sure he takes care of his fine .
parking tickets , sir ?
governor , please , with all due respect ...
come on . this is a complete waste of our time .
... any rookie straight out of the academy can handle this .
really ?
it &apos;s a waste of taxpayer &apos;s ...
he &apos;s right , sir , he &apos;s right .
look at this , you &apos;re already agreeing on something .
see to it .
you coming ?
are you coming ?
i don &apos;t ride shotgun .
neither do i.
you get lost ?
you know , you blew two red lights on the way over here .
you should file another complaint .
yeah , i would , except your boy governor denning
would just tear it up , so what &apos;s the point ?
let &apos;s get this over with .
hello ? !
nobody &apos;s home .
works for me .
really ? boy , i know you like to cut corners ,
but what kind of half @-@ ass job was that ?
okay , i don &apos;t have time to play meter maid .
so you &apos;re just gonna leave then ?
yeah .
go protect ; i &apos;ll serve .
great .
you know , there are a lot of good cops
around here who started out doing menial tasks .
they learn to walk a beat , they learn to interact with people .
we don &apos;t all just get handed a unit to run .
yeah , i &apos;m really sorry i missed that part .
we were a little busy fighting the taliban .
what are you , pavlov &apos;s dog or something ?
that halo .
my son plays it all the time .
okay .
chief commander to bravo team , eyes on the perimeter .
watch your six .
any sign of prometheans ,
shoot to kill .
five @-@ o , you , uh , you ian wright ?
uh , yeah , can i help you ?
yeah , you &apos;ve been served .
yeah , i know i dropped my weapon .
i got to go .
son , you failed to pay your parking tickets .
we &apos;re gonna place you under arrest . turn around .
this is a joke , right ?
since when do they send two guys from five @-@ o for parking tickets ?
he &apos;s not five @-@ o.
i &apos;m not five @-@ o !
okay .
can &apos;t i just pay online ?
well , you probably could &apos;ve three months ago , right ,
when you got the tickets ,
but i can see how that would &apos;ve slipped your mind .
all right , come on , enough chitchat . let &apos;s go .
can &apos;t i at least put a t @-@ shirt on ?
yeah , please .
i &apos;ve seen enough shirtless wonders for one day .
you know , your , uh , your tactical approach is whack .
you know that , right ?
so , is this some kind of new program for unpaid parking tickets ?
it &apos;s just seems a little aggressive .
take your time picking a shirt there , ian .
take your time .
that &apos;s disgusting .
okay , he &apos;s riding with you .
me ?
you got xm by any chance ?
you got xm ?
this day just keeps getting better and better .
so , if i &apos;m riding with you , how am i getting back here ?
why don &apos;t you have one of bravo team come pick you up ?
well , none of them live in hawaii .
well , you &apos;re a smart kid , ian .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll figure it out .
get down !
ian !
who are these guys ?
i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t know !
i don &apos;t know !
move it !
i &apos;m out !
i got one round left !
you &apos;re hit !
we got to cut them off before they pin us down .
i &apos;m going out the back .
you take care of the kid .
stay down .
go ! i &apos;m right behind you .
get up , get up .
no , no , no .
help ! help me !
help !
help me !
help ! help me !
damn it !
got it .
all right . this should help stop the bleeding .
no , no , no , it &apos;s nothing , it &apos;s nothing .
that nothing you got is leaking pretty good .
i &apos;m fine .
you know what , fine .
go ahead , pass out , you stubborn son of a bitch .
i don &apos;t care .
you know what , give it , give it .
here , here , okay ?
yeah . hurt , don &apos;t it ?
hey , grover , can you help me tie this tourniquet ?
sure , buddy , no problem .
now , why do you suppose these guys
would want to kidnap a knucklehead like ian ?
i have no idea .
we got to get in touch with the hpd as soon as possible .
well , the kid &apos;s got no landline ,
and our cell service is dead up here .
we got to move .
damn it !
what &apos;s wrong ?
was i talking to you ?
you have a very angry disposition , you know that ?
oh , well , maybe it &apos;s &apos; cause i &apos;m with you .
would you stop doing that ?
you look like a flying giraffe .
how the hell can there be no cell reception up here ?
welcome to waimanalo .
you know , mcgarrett , i got to ask you ,
why is it that you are the constant variable
in every pile of crap i step in ?
oh , that &apos;s good , this is my fault .
i &apos;m just calling it like i see it , man .
wherever you go , trouble follows .
that &apos;s funny coming from you .
what the hell is that supposed to mean ?
you don &apos;t think i did my homework , huh ?
hpd hires a new swat commander ,
you don &apos;t think i &apos;m gonna check you out ?
it &apos;s not every day that a 20 @-@ year vet on track
to becoming superintendent up and moves to a rock
in the middle of the pacific .
unless he &apos;s running from something .
oh , by night , he &apos;s a navy seal ,
by day , he &apos;s a shrink .
just want to know who i &apos;m working with , man .
hey , i show up for work , i do my job .
that all you need to know .
what ?
gasoline .
we must have hit their fuel tank .
that &apos;s their car .
clear .
you smell that ?
tear gas .
yeah , and that pink stain is from a dye pack .
i think these guys hit a bank .
from the looks of things , not too long ago .
what the hell did this kid get himself into ?
well , they &apos;re on foot , they couldn &apos;t have gotten far .
over there .
can you even ride ?
can you ? cha !
cha !
there they are !
mcgarrett , where the hell are we going ?
we &apos;re gonna cut them off !
there they are !
cha !
they ain &apos;t stopping !
i can see that .
steve ?
chin , listen .
put out an apb on ian wright .
is this the kid with the parking tickets ?
yeah , he was kidnapped .
the people who took him were last seen headed north
on kalanianaole highway .
they &apos;re in a gold nissan pathfinder .
license plate is echo- three @-@ four @-@ tango @-@ romeo @-@ one .
all right , i &apos;m on it .
all right , and hey ,
send a csu up to that waimanalo house .
all right , have them process the place .
i want to know everything there is to know about ian wright .
just a flesh wound , commander .
you &apos;re all set .
steve , it &apos;s cath . are you okay ?
yeah , i am . don &apos;t worry .
listen , check your e @-@ mail , catherine .
i just sent you photographs of fingerprints
of the two shooters we just took down .
we need to get their i.d. &apos; s ,
we need to figure out what they wanted with ian .
okay ? call me when you got something .
all right , i &apos;ll call you back .
listen , i just got off with one of my guys .
he says there &apos;s only one bank in the area
that uses tear gas in their dye packs .
let &apos;s go .
gentlemen ...
i assure you there &apos;s been no robbery .
see ? there &apos;s a live feed
running around the clock . it &apos;s all there .
but if you insist ...
we insist .
ran the prints on your two dead shooters .
turns out , they were part of a four @-@ man stick @-@ up crew
focusing primarily on banks .
all were released from fdc honolulu
within the last three months .
these ...
were the other two .
kurt simon and luke davis .
those are the two guys that grabbed ian .
okay , all right , this doesn &apos;t make any sense .
these guys are nickel and dime .
it took an expert hacker to pull off that bank job .
why do i suddenly get the feeling
that ian &apos;s not your average knucklehead ?
because he isn &apos;t .
this kid &apos;s been living
on his own since he was 18 years old .
his parents are both deceased .
and up until last semester ,
he was a computer science major at o &apos;ahu state .
what happen ? he drop out ?
expelled .
he hacked into the university &apos;s computer system ,
stole final exams ,
and then got caught selling them to the entire student body .
csu found a server at his house .
toast is trying to recover any data ,
but he &apos;s having trouble because it &apos;s encrypted
using nsa @-@ level firewalls .
all right , so our bank robbers hired ian
to help pull off this heist .
uh , the kid helped them get past the security systems .
they go in , grab the cash .
maybe that &apos;s why they were going to his place .
to split up the money .
i don &apos;t think so .
if it was about everybody getting their share ,
they would &apos;ve hightailed it out of there
the minute they saw our cars .
i think you &apos;re right .
they need ian for something else .
lieutenant kelly .
yeah , good work . thanks .
that was hpd .
they found our suspects stolen vehicle in a parking lot
in maunalua valley .
they searched the area , didn &apos;t find the robbers
or no sign of ian .
well , did they happen to find a pink laptop ?
with the chicago skyline on it ?
the car was empty . why ?
damn it .
they stole your computer ?
you , uh , you didn &apos;t think that was important to mention to us ?
well , i &apos;m mentioning it now .
and it &apos;s not my computer anyway . it &apos;s my daughter &apos;s .
i don &apos;t care whose computer it is .
ian &apos;s a hacker . if he stole it ,
it &apos;s now a weapon .
all right ! all right , mcgarrett .
you &apos;re right .
i should &apos;ve mentioned it earlier .
it &apos;s just that ... - just that what ?
look , man .
do you know i caught my daughter playing show @-@ and @-@ tell
with some little punk online this morning ?
wh @-@ what &apos;s that look ? what @-@ what ? you think it &apos;s funny ?
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m not laughing .
oh , you , too , huh ? oh , i see .
neither one of you have kids . that &apos;s all right .
laugh it up . your day &apos;s coming .
ah , it &apos;s hormones and technology .
tell me about it .
every father &apos;s worst damn nightmare .
you know what ? i can track your daughter &apos;s laptop .
if it comes online , we can locate it .
okay , look , last time i checked ,
computer geeks and bank robbers don &apos;t exactly
run in the same circles .
i &apos;m thinking somebody had to make an introduction .
i &apos;m thinking you &apos;re right .
check this out .
no .
you &apos;ll get the hang of it , newbie .
okay , so much for my dramatic entrance .
all right , here we have eli diamond .
he &apos;s a defense attorney .
former clients include our bank robbers and ian wright .
repped ian when o &apos;ahu state pressed charges
for hacking their system .
so , eli diamond played matchmaker .
where is he ?
house arrest . awaiting trial for tax evasion .
and , uh , gps bracelet puts him there right now .
eli diamond , five @-@ o !
i got blood !
clear .
mcgarrett !
looks like eli diamond made parole .
chin , put out an apb on eli diamond .
and track his car .
looks like he &apos;s making a run for it .
all right , i got diamond &apos;s car at ala wai marina .
and get this .
he &apos;s got a boat .
five @-@ o !
freeze !
freeze ! stay down .
show me your hands .
hands behind your head .
interlock your fingers right now .
interlock your fingers .
interlock your fingers .
stay down !
stay down , stay down !
ian ?
ian !
ian &apos;s not here .
where the hell is he ?
is he alive ?
answer the question !
okay , listen .
diamond told us
you were supposed to bring ian
to disable the ankle bracelet .
you showed up without him . why ?
you know , it &apos;s a funny thing about ... words .
see , 99 % of the species ,
they get along without using them .
me personally ?
oh , i &apos;m a big fan of non @-@ verbal communication .
you feel me ?
threaten me all you want .
if i talk ...
i &apos;m a dead man .
who are you afraid of ?
you can &apos;t be afraid of diamond . we have him .
come with me .
there was only one other person involved in this .
all right , we got this all wrong .
the bank robbers didn &apos;t hire ian .
ian hired them .
diamond makes the introductions .
ian promises to boost him from his ankle bracelet .
everybody wins .
until we showed up .
ian knew it wouldn &apos;t take long to figure out
diamond was the connection between him and the crew .
so he splits .
leaves diamond no choice but to hack off his own foot .
this kid played us .
yeah ?
yeah , we &apos;re on the way .
toast broke the encryption on ian &apos;s server .
looks like he &apos;s been planning this bank robbery
for about six months ,
judging from the series of wire transfers .
you know , this kid has millions of dollars
in an offshore account .
money that we traced back to terrorist organizations .
the dates correspond with cyber attacks
on a factory in pune and a power plant in beijing .
so ian was selling his skills to the highest bidder .
well , that explains why our suspect is so afraid of him .
kid &apos;s lined himself up with
some pretty nasty fanatics .
well , it gets worse .
the company that designed the bank &apos;s security system ?
they just won a government contract
to update all u.s. embassies
with the same technology .
this was never about the bank robbery for ian .
he was testing the system .
catherine , contact the state department , tell them
their security &apos;s compromised .
copy that .
grover . yeah ?
your daughter &apos;s laptop just came online .
where is it ?
got him !
ian wright .
crocket and tubbs .
i knew you &apos;d get my message .
get up .
get up .
hands behind your head , interlock your fingers .
turn around . turn around .
cross your legs .
you don &apos;t want to do that .
oh , believe me . i really want to do this .
mcgarrett ?
what ?
you think i brought you here without a plan .
that is flight 408 out of los angeles .
305 passengers ,
eight crew , two pilots .
scheduled to land here in honolulu in just over two hours .
see , we &apos;ve advanced so far technologically ,
we &apos;re no longer satisfied with a simple ,
&quot; uh , your flight &apos;s on time . &quot;
no , see we want to know every detail .
and we want to know it now .
you know what makes all that possible ?
gps .
most people don &apos;t realize it was created
by the department of defense during the cold war as a weapon .
it allowed our subs to get an accurate fix
on their target before firing off a missile .
but when the government opened it up to civilian use ,
they cheaped out .
see , they didn &apos;t want to spend the cash
to encrypt civilian gps like they did military .
which means that everything gets its data from civilian gps
is vulnerable to be hacked .
shipping lanes , trains , car navigation ,
and of course ... commercial airlines .
what the hell have you done , ian ?
it &apos;s not what i &apos;ve done , commander .
it &apos;s what i will do .
i have control of flight 408 .
if you don &apos;t do exactly what i say ,
i will drop it in the ocean .
there &apos;s a flight leaving for pago pago in 30 minutes .
once i &apos;ve landed and i know i &apos;m not being followed ,
i &apos;ll send instructions on how to get back control of flight 408 .
i &apos;m not putting you on a plane with passengers , ian .
son , we already have your money from the robbery .
we know about the embassies . there &apos;s no play here .
you just need to stop this .
and we &apos;ll try to make a deal .
a deal ?
i &apos;ve committed acts of treason .
there won &apos;t be any deals .
it &apos;s 300 people ... you got to stop this .
no chance .
turn it off .
you think i &apos;m stupid ?
the computer running the hack is somewhere else .
this one just lets me keep an eye on it .
there &apos;s got to be another way to shut this thing off .
yeah , of course there is .
but it requires you putting me on that plane .
where &apos;s the other computer , ian ?
where &apos;s the other computer ?
you just don &apos;t get it , do you ?
this is speed chess , gentlemen .
and you were checkmated 15 moves ago .
now , put me on that plane or 300 people are going to die .
what did the tower say ?
they confirmed that flight 408 &apos;s been hacked .
ian &apos;s tricked the plane &apos;s gps
into thinking that they &apos;re on course
when they &apos;re not .
it &apos;s called spoofing .
now , if that plane stays on its current path ,
they &apos;re going to be so far out over the ocean
by the time they realize something &apos;s wrong ,
they &apos;re not going to have enough fuel to land .
you got to call the pilot and get them back on course .
we can &apos;t . the tower &apos;s lost communication with the plane .
you get back to that tower , okay ?
keep trying to get in touch with that plane .
i want constant updates .
copy .
catherine .
steve , so i just reached out to naval intelligence .
they &apos;ve been developing protocols
to defend against these type of cyber attacks .
okay , good . what &apos;s their course of action ?
jamming the attack with software .
now , they &apos;re sending me a zip file ,
but it &apos;s only a prototype ,
and it &apos;s only been tested on simulated attacks .
we need to upload it to ian &apos;s computer
and hopefully it &apos;ll interrupt the signal .
we can &apos;t do that , okay ?
the computer running the attack is not here .
we don &apos;t know where that is .
he &apos;s monitoring it from this laptop .
all right . that &apos;s okay because that means
the two computers are connected .
so ... we already have a tap on grover &apos;s laptop ,
so all we need to do is trace the connection
back to the computer that &apos;s running the attack .
cath , you got something ?
he scrambled the signal , steve .
i &apos;m staring at about a hundred different ip addresses
on o &apos;ahu right now .
i mean , one of them is the location ,
but this is going to take days to narrow down .
we don &apos;t have days .
catherine , we have minutes .
put every resource we have on this .
we &apos;re screwed , aren &apos;t we ?
300 lives .
i don &apos;t think we have a choice
but to put ian on this plane .
i think that &apos;s the right decision .
thank you .
all right , now , so we got 20 minutes
before we got to put this kid on a flight .
maybe there &apos;s some way we can find
where he &apos;s hidden that other computer .
hpd has his server .
i mean , where else is he going to go to pull this off ?
someplace familiar , someplace he would trust .
problem is , we have no intel on this guy
except that he plays xbox and he gets parking tickets .
he gets parking tick ...
hey , you still got that arrest warrant ?
yeah .
let me see that .
all right , he got six parking tickets in three months ,
all in west o &apos;ahu .
you recognize any of these addresses ?
these are all near o &apos;ahu state .
someplace familiar .
hey , cath .
check out the ip addresses we got .
see if any of them is a location near o &apos;ahu state .
somewhere around the 300 north carver block .
steve , okay , one of the addresses
is 330 north carver road .
it &apos;s the computer science building .
all right , good . that &apos;s got to be it .
i &apos;m on my way .
all right , the plane to pago pago
leaves in 15 minutes , all right ?
until we hear back from catherine ,
we stick with the plan .
all right .
let &apos;s go .
get up .
i hope you booked me a window seat .
walk .
what are you doing ?
excuse me ?
are you using this computer ?
i &apos;m , uh , saving it for a friend .
okay .
that him ?
yeah . gave me 500 bucks to hold this seat ...
get up .
get up now . up .
you &apos;ll get an e @-@ mail with instructions once i land .
i &apos;ll see you soon .
oh , tell your daughter i said thanks for the loaner .
or maybe i &apos;ll just tell her in person one day .
get your ass on that plane
before you get a bullet in your face .
come on , catherine .
come on , come on , come on .
come on , come on .
it &apos;s uploaded . the signal &apos;s been jammed .
pilots have regained control of flight 408 .
all right . let &apos;s get him .
where the hell did he go ?
we got the whole airport on lockdown ,
but so far , no sign of ian .
passengers on the plane said
he got up to use the restroom , he never came back to his seat .
i don &apos;t know how this kid did what he did .
couldn &apos;t have gotten far , though .
paxana airlines
we &apos;ll find him .
flight 408 from los angeles
has arrived at gate 34a .
you made the right call .
steve ...
governor , before you say anything , i , uh ...
i want to take full responsibility for today &apos;s events , okay ?
captain grover , he @-@ he was simply following my orders , sir .
that &apos;s funny-- captain grover said the exact same thing .
a lot of lives were saved today
because of you two .
well done , gentlemen .
that was good work today , commander .
you , too , captain .
you need a ride ?
i don &apos;t ride shotgun .
see , now i believe you &apos;re doing your homework .
this mean i get my computer back ?
all right .
let &apos;s get something straight , young lady .
as long as you &apos;re living in my house , under my roof ,
there will be no more you @-@ know @-@ what
with you @-@ know @-@ who .
are we clear ?
yes , daddy .
all right .
listen , um ...
i realize it was difficult for you
