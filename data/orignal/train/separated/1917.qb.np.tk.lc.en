&quot; take it back &quot;
alex , you have a father .
i know , and he &apos;s a dirtbag .
i paged you to get yang .
yang &apos;s at the wedding . i &apos;m here .
dr. derek shepherd .
yes .
please hold for the president of the united states .
i cannot believe we &apos;re doing this !
all this blood ... doctor , bypass --
i have it ! 2 @-@ 0 silk !
maybe it &apos;s time we talked about
why the hell you up and quit surgery .
what do we got here , son ?
i did this . it &apos;s my fault .
i love you , april . i always have .
and i think that you love me , too .
do you ?
every day , a surgeon makes decisions
that can go one of two ways --
either very good or very , very , very bad .
the problem is , the epically great decisions
and the epically bad ones
look exactly the same when you &apos;re making them .
april , do you ...
do you not want to do this ?
drive the car .
meredith , when the president of the united states
calls you on the phone -- - i get it .
you can &apos;t -- you can &apos;t say no to the guy .
nope .
i mean , when they start putting government money behind a --
a program like that , mapping the human brain ,
the impact that that has worldwide is just --
big impact . get me my curling iron , please .
the weeping sisters have gone through
every tissue in this building .
did you get the mother to calm down , at least ?
i tried .
but how was i supposed to pretend
that what just happened wasn &apos;t the coolest thing i &apos;d ever seen ?
cristina
you know , i &apos;ve always been on the fence about kepner ,
but now i &apos;m not just a friend , i &apos;m a fan .
was that about me ?
no , it &apos;s about me .
the president called , and i have to go back
on a promise i made to her .
oh , good . better you than me .
president ?
of the united states .
you are ... not serious .
something &apos;s going on at the hospital .
i want him fired !
i want him arrested !
webber is watching over your father like a hawk .
his vitals are stable , and we &apos;re gonna do our best
to keep it that way , okay ?
what the hell was this kid thinking ?
he wasn &apos;t thinking .
yeah , no kidding .
he was hallucinating .
he had no idea what was happening .
he thought the patient on the table was heather brooks .
oh , my god .
what ?
he showed me how to fudge your hours in the system
so you can continue working without having to sleep .
for god &apos;s sakes ...
i &apos;ll find him .
cristina &apos;s on her way . she &apos;s gonna --
no , yang is not touching him .
alex , i think--
if that kid messed up , it &apos;s on her .
she lets him think he runs the place .
why do you think he hacked up jimmy &apos;s heart all on his own ? !
let &apos;s just wait until we get all the facts --
she &apos;s screwing him !
okay , would you just take a breath for a second ?
this one doesn &apos;t even have a card !
how is april supposed to return her gift
if we can &apos;t even manage to keep the gifts with the card ?
okay , we &apos;ll find the cards . arizona !
stop .
we will fix it .
no ! we won &apos;t !
that &apos;s the whole problem .
you &apos;ve been trying to fix it -- our marriage .
you &apos;ve been trying to fix me , and you &apos;re so good !
you &apos;re killing yourself just to fix me !
you don &apos;t have to apologize --
i &apos;m not ! that &apos;s the point !
because i &apos;m not the same person that i was before ,
and i don &apos;t want to apologize , and i don &apos;t want to be fixed .
whoa , whoa ! whoa , whoa , whoa .
i &apos;m not the same person i was before , either , but that doesn &apos;t --
it &apos;s not working , and you know it !
you knew it before i did .
okay , can we just go home
and sit down and talk about this ?
it &apos;s not my home anymore .
maybe you could stop acting like a child --
oh , now i &apos;m a child .
oh , that &apos;s great . that &apos;s -- that &apos;s great .
i &apos;m childish . i caused your ocd .
what -- what else you got ? did i cause global warming ?
maybe -- maybe i killed jfk ! that would explain a lot , right ?
you quit surgery !
see , this was supposed to be different
than my first marriage .
i thought you understood what it means to be a surgeon !
until you dropped it !
and now here i am , once again , married to a man
who &apos;s waiting to see me at the end of the day ,
waiting to see what i &apos;m gonna do ,
when i &apos;m gonna come home !
you think i was happy
to walk away from a surgical residency ?
you think you were , what , a- convenient excuse to dump it ?
well , yes .
no , i was a damned star !
i had found what i &apos;d been looking for for decades ,
and i -- i walked away from it , yes ,
because i wanted to be here with you !
and it was the hardest choice i ever had to make .
you didn &apos;t want to leave surgery ?
no ! i did not want to leave surgery .
hey . still no shane .
i &apos;m gonna try his apartment .
if he &apos;s dead on the side of the road , i am going to lose it .
could you take her home ? she &apos;s had a rough day .
at a wedding ?
what , you drank too much champagne ?
you have blisters on your feet from all the dancing ?
my boyfriend ran off with the bride .
what ? !
there was no dancing .
i &apos;m gonna find you a ride home ,
and as soon as things calm down with alex and his dad ,
i &apos;m gonna come over
and we &apos;re gonna drink a lot and burn things .
can you wait five minutes ?
jackson , pull over .
jackson , just pull over the car . - just -- what is it ?
jackson , please , just pull over the car now !
relax .
just calm down .
calm down ? !
what are we doing ?
is -- is there a plan ?
is -- there &apos;s no plan .
you think i would plan to ruin your wedding ?
no -- no ! that doesn &apos;t seem like you .
all right , april , look --
i can &apos;t . i &apos;m sorry .
we can &apos;t do this . i can &apos;t .
they &apos;ll fix the gutters ,
the water damage in the bedroom , all of it .
you know , i rarely see a deal go through this fast .
you were really ready to move .
yeah , sometimes you just need a fresh start .
congratulations .
um , i &apos;m not sure we should be popping the champagne just yet .
there &apos;s a man @-@ sized blood stain in the bedroom .
now , they said they &apos;d replace the carpet
before the close of escrow .
it &apos;s rust .
i think they said the carpet guy &apos;s coming today .
oh . let me call them .
it &apos;s beautiful .
and it &apos;s gonna be ours .
it &apos;s a murder house .
callie . try .
it &apos;s ...
... kind of beautiful .
paging dr. man -- dr. sharp @-@ dressed man .
i have kind of a big thing today .
me too .
rounds with webber in 20,
followed by an e.r. shift that -- fingers crossed --
could lead to my assisting
on any number of grisly traumas this afternoon .
what &apos;s your thing ?
i &apos;m being vetted by the white house .
so it &apos;s kind of a big day for both of us .
if steph doesn &apos;t want to talk about it , we can &apos;t force it .
it &apos;s been three weeks , and we haven &apos;t been able
to get one scrap of real intel
on what happened between kepner and avery .
they &apos;re avoiding each other , she &apos;s avoiding us ,
and nobody &apos;s saying anything .
warren , you sit at the grown @-@ ups &apos; table .
you have to know something .
mnh @-@ mnh . i don &apos;t like gossip .
i don &apos;t like you .
steph ! oh , my god , hi !
you came out of hiding ! yay !
i haven &apos;t been in hiding .
okay , i &apos;ve been in hiding , but ...
time heals wounds or whatever .
really ?
yeah , absolutely .
that &apos;s shane &apos;s gear . is he back ?
i haven &apos;t seen him .
i can &apos;t believe the board decided to let him come back .
yeah , i bet a couple weeks &apos; rest did him good .
he &apos;s a -- he &apos;s a good kid who went down a bad road .
can it , pops .
how old do you people think i am ?
49 .
ben warren , you forgot your lunch .
you didn &apos;t -- you didn &apos;t have to do that , baby .
i was -- i was gonna go to the cafeteria .
you do that , you &apos;re gonna grab a pizza or a burger
and then come complaining to me about heartburn ,
and i don &apos;t want to hear it .
can i change my answer ?
&apos;cause now i want to say you &apos;re 12 .
you told her what ?
she &apos;s been dodging my calls for weeks .
someone needs to take responsibility for jimmy ,
and it &apos;s not gonna be me .
technically , they &apos;re still married .
yeah , but you can &apos;t just lie .
turns out i can . it &apos;s really easy .
good god , you look just like your father .
sorry . alex .
this is my fiance , jo wilson .
naomi .
right . well , we &apos;re gonna walk this way .
mvc pileup at the downtown waterfront . whoa !
we &apos;ve got multiple victims coming in here , people !
be careful !
cars took out a bunch of pedestrians , too .
was she conscious in the field ?
nope .
okay , let &apos;s get her to trauma room 4 .
ross ! i need hands .
ross , stay where you are .
you &apos;re with me today .
edwards , go help avery .
avery ?
oh . no . sorry , uh ...
not edwards . okay .
warren , avery needs hands .
now , hang on a second . warren &apos;s with me .
you can &apos;t break up the big dogs .
webber , i &apos;m having enough trouble
juggling who can work with who .
don &apos;t make it any harder .
oh , for god &apos;s sake , i &apos;ll go with avery .
wouldn &apos;t want to break up the &quot; old dogs &quot; or anything .
it &apos;s big dogs .
no , not a dog .
it was a cat -- a really big cat .
coming through !
another coming !
pedestrian , hit by a car , vitals are stable .
possible fracture to the right arm .
holy crap !
you know it &apos;s not my face that &apos;s injured .
it &apos;s my arm .
meow .
over there .
oh , okay .
dr. shepherd .
miles green . this is rita belmont .
nice to meet you , miles . rita , pleasure .
sorry i &apos;m late .
yeah , we knew you &apos;d be late .
we &apos;ve been tracking your phone
since last we spoke .
no , i &apos;m messing with you !
we don &apos;t track your phone . come on , have a seat .
i &apos;m sorry .
but , uh , don &apos;t kid yourself ,
because we do know a crazy amount of stuff about you .
now , the white house requires a deeper @-@ than @-@ normal
background check on anyone associated
with the president &apos;s programs ,
so this process can get a little personal .
i understand .
great . so , you know , let &apos;s just , uh ...
ask you a few questions ,
eat a little lunch , and go home happy .
what do you say ? okay .
let &apos;s start with your wife .
so , uh , you two met when
she was a student of yours , was she not ?
yeah , i suppose .
is that bad ?
you feel like , uh , getting out of the lab for half a day ?
i &apos;ve got an aortic aneurysm repair .
really ?
you want to do it together ?
unless you &apos;re busy or don &apos;t want to .
no , i &apos;d love to . sure . are you sure ?
positive . it &apos;d be fun , right ?
okay . great .
and i was just walking down the street
and some chick blows through a red light --
six @-@ car smash @-@ up .
one even comes up on the sidewalk and takes me out .
stupid woman ...
his pupils are unresponsive .
these are contacts , right ?
yes .
and the teeth are ... ?
veneers -- permanent . whiskers -- piercings .
so , you guys gonna doctor me up or what ?
he complained of abdominal tenderness .
right , uh , get a c.t. to rule out internal injuries ,
and then we &apos;ll fix the arm .
you know what ? um , t @-@ there was a little kid out there --
cracked her head open .
is she okay ?
we can find out .
yeah , you know what ? let &apos;s just worry about
getting you out of here with all of your nine lives , okay ?
hustle up , ross .
you &apos;re trying to protect her airway , not make it worse .
epiglottis is in the way .
i can &apos;t see the ...
dr. warren , take over for dr. ross .
i &apos;m sorry .
now , that is how a second @-@ year resident intubates .
okay , ross , go find her phone .
see if she has any emergency contacts listed ,
unless you want dr. warren to show you how to do that , too .
ross is still a little fragile .
that kind of tough love may wash him out
before he had a chance to get back on his feet .
you don &apos;t mistake any of this for love .
if i had my way , he would not be here .
if the board want to go against my recommendation
and bring him back , that &apos;s fine .
but i &apos;m still the chief of surgery ,
so i will deal with him as i see fit .
you didn &apos;t bring your son .
wasn &apos;t any reason to bring nicky .
i &apos;m really only here for that guitar .
you can do whatever you want with the rest of his stuff .
keep it , toss it . dealer &apos;s choice .
what the hell is this ?
he &apos;s not dead ?
no .
you lied to me .
yeah .
you know , this is our first surgery together
since everything fell apart .
i know . i &apos;m enjoying it .
me too , but i have a question that might ruin the mood .
well , just ask your question .
where is shane ?
after the way you pushed us all to let him come back ...
i -- you were right about him .
i should &apos;ve seen it coming .
i am so pissed at him .
i &apos;m afraid if i see him again ,
i &apos;ll rip his arms out by the root .
plus , alex just started talking to me again .
you know , the parenting books say
when your kid does something wrong ,
you have to put your anger aside when you talk to them .
oh , is that how you &apos;re dealing with derek ?
totally .
and what &apos;s awesome is , the nicer i am ,
the guiltier he feels .
it &apos;s the only fun i have lately .
mer , the president called him personally .
you really want to defend him
when we were having such a good time ?
you &apos;re right . screw the guy .
thank you .
a proposal &apos;s a big deal . you remember a proposal .
was i drunk ? do i drink too much ?
you do drink a lot .
screw your life .
screw your perfect little life .
what part of &quot; accidentally engaged &quot; sounds perfect to you ?
oh , my god .
it was at the wedding .
stop talking about weddings and engagements .
she just got left at the altar .
no , she wasn &apos;t .
she was left near an altar .
ow ! what ?
sorry , i just -- i needed the c.t. for a patient .
my patient needs a c.t.
we &apos;re almost done .
great ! cool . take your time . i want you to have it , really .
i &apos;ll just come back later .
what a bitch .
totes .
you need closure . why don &apos;t you just go talk to jackson ?
why don &apos;t you just talk to your fiance ?
this can &apos;t be legal .
you can &apos;t just call someone up
and say &quot; he &apos;s dead &quot; if it &apos;s not true .
well , he is dying .
he &apos;s septic . his organs are failing .
he &apos;s got a few days at the most .
look , he knows you &apos;re coming .
so , what , i &apos;m supposed to sit in there , hold his hand ,
and kiss away his tears like he wasn &apos;t a complete bastard ?
that guitar belonged to my father .
left me three of them when he died .
jimmy pawned the other two .
one day , the third one disappeared .
and so did he .
look , it all started because he came in here
trying to get clean -- for you and nicky .
i mean , it was hell , but he did it .
at this point , i think you &apos;re the only reason
he &apos;s still trying to hang on .
don &apos;t bail on him now .
i was with jimmy for five years .
i know what it sounds like when he &apos;s full of crap .
you are 100 % his son .
it took 15 surgeries total .
spent everything i had .
how many people do you know that are unhappy with who they are ?
and do they do anything to change it ?
&apos;cause , see , i didn &apos;t like who i was .
but i had the balls to become who i wanted to be .
i committed .
some people get a gym membership .
you went all @-@ in .
i like it .
how &apos;s it go over with the ladies ?
well , you know , i had a girlfriend when i started all this .
she loved it .
you know , but that ended ... and , uh ...
listen , let &apos;s just say the cat man
gets more than his share of tail , okay ?
okay .
that &apos;s all i &apos;m saying .
yeah .
hey , what &apos;s the word on that little kid ?
she wake up yet ?
well , i am so sorry ,
but patient information &apos;s confidential , so ...
it &apos;s bad news , then , huh ?
all right , you can go ahead and remove those clamps .
is there something you need to say to me , dr. murphy ?
you couldn &apos;t have given her a heads @-@ up ,
in the months you were seeing each other ?
she was worried about kepner .
she asked about it , and you didn &apos;t say anything .
what , were you just waiting for the right time
to publicly humiliate her ?
i could &apos;ve just kept working .
i didn &apos;t even have to ask you .
why the hell did i ask you ?
i guess you have a problem with impulse control .
i have been trying to apologize to her for weeks now .
she walks away the moment she sees me coming .
i am miserable about what i did to her .
i had no idea i was gonna do it ...
not till the moment it happened .
still , steph &apos;s alone ,
kepner &apos;s alone , you &apos;re alone .
everybody &apos;s pretty miserable .
seems like it all worked out really well , doesn &apos;t it ?
dr. murphy , i &apos;m gonna get back to fixing this man &apos;s arm .
now , you can glare at me all you want to ,
but you are gonna help .
they were all just staring at me , judging me ,
with their little resident eyes .
like they used to stare at you --
cheater eyes .
ooh , yeah . cheater eyes are the worst .
but it &apos;s not like you deserve it , right ?
i mean , you and jackson --
it &apos;s not the same thing .
i mean , is it ?
well , i --
hey , renee called .
the carpet &apos;s gonna be done by 3 : 00,
and then we have an appointment with the notary at 5 : 00 .
oh , you guys are signing papers on the house today ?
that is so great !
well , maybe not .
there &apos;s no way i can be out of here before 5 : 00 .
no , it &apos;s fine . he &apos;s a traveling notary .
he can come to us .
splendid .
oh , and i have this ice @-@ cream maker
i couldn &apos;t figure out how to send back .
that &apos;ll be your housewarming gift !
congratulations !
i told you we should &apos;ve kept track of the cards .
what happened ? did you get the dirt
on her and avery ?
i &apos;ve been trying to get ben to do recon with the residents ,
but he &apos;s all , &quot; i don &apos;t like to gossip . &quot;
what ? !
dr. torres ,
robert fischer &apos;s missing from his room ,
and nobody knows where he is .
the cat man ! the cat got out .
dr. ross , how about a little lunch with the big dogs ?
dr. hunt wants me to triple @-@ check
all of penny &apos;s labs before we take her to surgery .
well , we &apos;re not taking her into surgery for a while .
you have time to sit down .
besides , dr. warren could use some friends his own age .
how old do you think i am ?
is that a dinosaur ?
&quot; have a wonderful day , my special boy .
don &apos;t forget to wash your hands . &quot;
i obviously have tuck &apos;s lunch by mistake .
yeah , i &apos;m getting a burger .
it &apos;s chief hunt .
i really need to get those labs .
i &apos;ll see you in surgery .
i &apos;m sorry , kid .
i just want to say i &apos;m sorry .
this is all my fault .
so get better , okay ?
just ...
just get better .
hey ! hey ! what are you doing in here ? !
i &apos;m sorry !
it happened before kepner &apos;s wedding , didn &apos;t it ?
you -- you said all that stuff about being together forever
and having a family .
that was you proposing .
are you serious right now ?
what do you -- what do you think it was ?
i thought that you were upset about your dad .
proposals usually end in &quot; will you marry me ? &quot;
if i &apos;d understood , i never would have said--
well , great .
naomi &apos;s walking out on jimmy ,
and now you &apos;re walking out on me .
it &apos;s freakin &apos; kismet .
listen to me !
i &apos;m not walking out on you .
but we can &apos;t get married
just because you &apos;re screwed up about your dad .
don &apos;t use him as an excuse for cold feet .
if you don &apos;t want to get married , just say so .
i don &apos;t ! i &apos;m not ready . okay ?
but that &apos;s not the point . this isn &apos;t about love .
this is about grief ...
i &apos;m not grieving !
alex--
damn it !
well , your sister &apos;s drug problem &apos;s under control .
she &apos;s sober , still going to meetings .
she is ? yeah .
she doesn &apos;t concern us .
hiring undocumented workers-- now , that &apos;ll get you the boot .
that and outstanding debt ,
but you &apos;re good there-- no student loans , even .
dr. shepherd ,
what can you tell us about michael boetcher ?
michael boetcher .
is michael , uh ...
is he relevant to this ?
let &apos;s start with why you &apos;ve been sending his mother
$ 3,500 every month .
you &apos;re here .
are they ?
no , they &apos;re not here .
i &apos;m afraid ... if i told you how much it ...
means to me that you got them to come on a plane ...
you might call them and tell them to forget it .
take it easy .
i still don &apos;t know
how you managed to convince them to come .
i told them you were dead .
wishful thinking ?
where &apos;s my guitar ?
i threw some of your stuff in storage .
oh , alex ...
can you bring it back down ?
it belonged to naomi &apos;s dad .
i took it .
of all the crap i &apos;ve done , that was one of the lowest .
i want to give it back .
please .
make sure i &apos;m awake when they -- when they get here .
well , looks like the bone &apos;s still intact ,
so you didn &apos;t do too much damage .
i never should &apos;ve done it .
you think ?
i never should have left the house .
this whole accident happened ,
all these people were hurt because of me !
because of some stupid thing i &apos;ve done to myself !
you know , when i started this , my parents -- everybody --
said , &quot; you think you &apos;re gonna like this in 20 years ? &quot;
i thought i would .
i thought i knew who i was .
i was 19 .
so now i work from home--
same data @-@ entry job for 16 years .
i can &apos;t date .
the kind of women who find me attractive
scare the crap out of me .
i don &apos;t have friends .
people stare , people laugh ...
people punch .
and time goes by , and i realize
i haven &apos;t left my house in a year and a half .
i said to myself , &quot; rob , you got to do something .
&quot; you-- you got to try and live again .
&quot; just go out .
just go for a walk . &quot;
that was this morning .
uh , we &apos;re just gonna finish splinting this up ,
make sure it &apos;s stable , okay ?
can you make it quick ?
i just want to go home .
jimmy &apos;s b.p. &apos; s gone to crap .
in and out of consciousness ?
yeah .
this is it , isn &apos;t it ?
he &apos;s out of time .
you okay ?
what ?
give me a break , mer . not you , too .
you of all people should understand .
you think there &apos;s anything you can do ?
he has a dnr . i don &apos;t think so .
let &apos;s finish up here and go take a look .
okay .
more suction .
got a bleeder . clamp , please .
hold on . dr. ross , take over .
which blood vessel is that ?
it &apos;s a branch of the superior mesenteric artery .
and how are you gonna repair it ?
i &apos;m gonna throw a surgical tie around the clamp .
3 @-@ 0 silk on a passer .
and what does the superior mesenteric artery supply ?
the midgut .
and what is the origin of the midgut ?
what ?
the embryology .
dr. hunt , i think he could probably do the tie
without the anatomy lesson .
dr. webber , i think a surgeon should be able to demonstrate
a complete understanding of the part of the body
before he operates on it .
the midgut is formed from the ...
the primary intestinal loop and
and ?
i &apos;m sorry .
and the cephalic limb develops into the distal duodenum , jejunum , and ileum .
you &apos;re about to place a stitch into this patient &apos;s body
and then seal her up ,
and you can &apos;t tell me the basic anatomy that you &apos;re repairing ?
i &apos;m sorry .
do not apologize to me one more time .
you don &apos;t owe me an apology .
you owe one to the man whose heart you ripped apart
because you didn &apos;t know what you were doing ,
just like you owe an apology to this girl ,
who is laying on this table , losing blood ,
because you don &apos;t know how to do a basic tie .
leave the o.r. , dr. ross .
dr. warren , do the tie .
hi .
hey .
it &apos;s , uh , really good to see you .
you know , i &apos;ve been calling ...
no , uh , i have a patient .
and he &apos;s done all these surgeries to look like a cat ,
and he doesn &apos;t want to look like a cat anymore ,
and he doesn &apos;t have any money .
but you could fix him , pro @-@ bono .
steph , i need to explain .
you telling me that you feel guilty only helps you .
not me .
if you want to do something useful ,
fix the cat man .
dr. karev ?
walk away , ross .
dr. karev , i owe you an apology .
i owe you both
what the hell ? ! wait ! alex , stop !
alex ! alex ! alex ! alex !
alex ! get off !
ross , get up , get up !
stop it ! stop it !
go !
stop it ! what is going on ? get off me , mer .
alex , please . please .
i thought if i ... came back , kept my head down ,
did the work , i might be able to ...
not fix it ,
but start to make up for what i did to karev &apos;s dad .
i don &apos;t deserve to feel better .
i deserved this .
yeah .
you really did .
baby nathan &apos;s mom sent me this .
it &apos;s one of those annoying pictures
all mothers think are cute of their baby
with food all over its face .
except this one ...
it &apos;s not cute .
it &apos;s miraculous .
revolutionary .
you saved a baby , shane ,
because you had the idea to 3 @-@ d print the conduit
and wouldn &apos;t stop pushing until i came around .
you made some bad choices ...
but that was a good one .
moving forward , make more good ones .
everywhere you see a red tag , sign your name .
okay .
i know you &apos;re excited .
you &apos;ve been smiling since we found the house ,
and i have missed that smile so much .
but three weeks ago , you were convinced we weren &apos;t gonna last .
i &apos;m worried that you &apos;re thinking about how good it feels now
and -- and not thinking about the fact
that i come with the house .
you know why i smile when i think about that house ?
i look at that house
and i don &apos;t see a hospital bed in our bedroom ,
and i don &apos;t see a shower that you had to drag me into
because i wouldn &apos;t do it on my own .
i see a tire swing
and a tree house .
we may wake up in a year
and realize it was a huge mistake .
but if it works ...
oh , my god .
just thinking about it makes me smile so hard my face hurts .
kissing the bride isn &apos;t enough .
you have to actually sign the papers .
what happened ? are you okay ?
it &apos;s my fault .
i knew i shouldn &apos;t get involved with him .
i knew it was a mistake , and i did it anyway .
it &apos;s too hard being here around him .
i should leave .
i could transfer .
leaving &apos;s not the answer .
he took advantage here , not you .
he &apos;s your boss , and he chose to start dating you .
and then he chose to humiliate you
in front of all of your co @-@ workers . he did that .
they all do it .
arizona did it to me , and yang did a number on shane .
they are our bosses , and we &apos;re expendable to them .
but we shouldn &apos;t be .
you could do something about it .
you shoud do something about it .
that was vicious .
he was drowning in there , and you were enjoying it .
well , i &apos;m sorry my style of leadership
doesn &apos;t involve taking ross to lunch .
tell me this isn &apos;t about who he was sleeping with .
you really think i would let that interfere
with the way that i do my job ?
i wouldn &apos;t have thought it before today .
chief hunt , there &apos;s someone from h.r. looking for you .
i &apos;ll be right there .
alex ?
naomi and nicky are on their way .
they &apos;re coming ?
they &apos;re on their way .
when ?
their plane was delayed .
i told them about the guitar .
they &apos;re coming ?
they &apos;re coming .
i , uh , told them about the guitar .
i told them ...
i to-- i told them that -- that you love them .
you -- you told them ?
i told them .
they know you love them . they know .
it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s okay , jimmy .
it &apos;s okay . they know you love them .
they know .
you can go .
they know . you can go .
you son of a bitch .
did you get anything out of edwards about avery or kepner ?
&quot; hello , honey . how was your day ? &quot;
come on .
a resident went off the rails and nearly killed a man .
i didn &apos;t see that coming .
people are buying houses and running out on marriages .
things are topsy @-@ turvy all over the place ,
and i don &apos;t understand any of it , so spill .
there &apos;s nothing to spill !
and even if there was , i wouldn &apos;t tell you ,
because i need these kids to trust me .
and the only reason
why there &apos;s a spot for me to fill
is because one of their friends died .
i have my work cut out for me as it is .
fine .
you had pizza for lunch , didn &apos;t you ?
no .
okay , you don &apos;t have to gossip with me , ben warren ,
but you &apos;d better not start lying to me .
it was a burger .
the plot thickens .
they found something .
i played hockey in high school .
i have a lot of slides to get through here , derek .
there was this kid -- michael boetcher .
he and i were the most aggressive guys on the team ,
and one day at practice ,
i cross @-@ checked him into the boards .
we both went down ,
both got back up , we continued to play .
boetcher didn &apos;t come back to school the next day .
he had a brain bleed that night .
he died ?
it was worse than that .
it was a pontine bleed , so he couldn &apos;t move ,
couldn &apos;t communicate . all he could do was blink .
so the president &apos;s people found out about this , or ... ?
he &apos;s been in long @-@ term care ever since .
i send his family money .
they wondered why .
so your deep , dark secret
is that you &apos;ve spent the last 30 years
paying for an accident that happened when you were a teenager ?
because i put him there .
and then you became a neurosurgeon , like a superhero .
and now the president of the united states
has hand @-@ picked you to carve out the future of medicine .
i have no room to be angry here , but this is infuriating !
if i could turn it down , i would .
you know what would help me ?
if you would just stop talking
about your duty to god and country
and just admit that you want to do this .
i do . of course i do . yes .
yeah , see , somehow , i thought that was gonna help me ,
but it only made me angrier !
hello ?
no , dr. shepherd cannot come to the phone right now
because he is fighting with his wife .
who is it ?
it &apos;s the white house .
give me the phone ! give me the phone .
it &apos;s owen . do you think i &apos;m nuts ?
they &apos;re calling an emergency board meeting .
is this about what happened with karev and ross ?
what happened with karev and ross ?
nothing .
one of our surgical residents has lodged
an official complaint with human resources .
three separate complaints , actually --
directed sexual harassment , quid @-@ pro @-@ quo harassment ,
and hostile work environment .
what ? who ? directed at whom ?
h.r. won &apos;t release that or the name of the resident .
hostile work environment ?
come on .
does she have a case , legally ?
o @-@ okay .
is there way that we could --
or maybe i could -- talk to this person ?
you know , we could just clear the air
before it gets out of proportion .
he shouldn &apos;t talk to her without legal present .
well , if she &apos;s already filed a complaint --
you &apos;re all missing the point !
this is not about one person .
this is a complaint about this hospital
and this teaching program .
we are too often letting our
personal lives disrupt our work .
none of us are guilt @-@ free ...
myself included .
now , h.r. have recommended a clear ,
zero @-@ tolerance policy .
&quot; excluding those of pre @-@ existing married couples ... &quot;
&quot; relationships of romantic or sexual nature
&quot; between superiors and subordinates
will not be allowed . &quot;
it is restrictive , it is non @-@ negotiable ...
but it is fair , and , better still , it is unambiguous .
i urge you all to vote to implement this .
looking back , it &apos;s easy to see
when a mistake has been made ...
to regret a choice
that seemed like a decent idea at the time ...
i hope you &apos;re okay with spaghetti .
i had to ditch that leftover chicken .
i found a home for the ice @-@ cream maker .
oh , i thought we were keeping it .
hope we didn &apos;t go through all that for nothing .
we had a board meeting tonight .
i don &apos;t think we &apos;re gonna be able
to keep this a secret much longer .
a meeting about us ?
kind of .
what happened ?
i &apos;ll tell you about it after dinner .
april , get back in the car !
you can &apos;t just walk back !
why ? !
bears ?
matthew doesn &apos;t deserve this !
and -- and stephanie ?
what are we supposed to say to them ?
my -- my parents ? your mother ?
oh , my god . my mother .
how do we explain that we just destroyed
two perfectly lovely people so that we could --
what , date ? !
okay , the best solution
is never to speak to any of them ever again .
or ... ?
or we get married . i ...
because that &apos;s easier to explain .
no .
no , &apos; cause you &apos;re right , all right ?
i don &apos;t want to just date .
april , i want the whole damn thing .
i --
we can get to lake tahoe in 13 hours .
how do you know that ?
do you want to get into that right now ?
no .
no , you don &apos;t want to get into that
or , no , you don &apos;t want to get married ?
... but if we used our best judgment
and listened to our hearts ,
we &apos;re more likely to see that we chose wisely ...
yes .
yes !
... and avoided the deepest , most painful regret of them all --
the regret that comes
from letting something amazing pass you by .
* my love will clothe your bones *
* and , darling , when your feet are cold *
* wait up , i &apos;m coming home *
* and all of you , i will hold *
