hey , guys .
hey .
hi .
hey .
we need to talk about something .
yeah . we don &apos;t feel like we can host thanksgiving this year .
what ?
are you kidding ?
well , it &apos;s just with work and the stress of adoption ..
we don &apos;t feel like we have the energy .
plus , we don &apos;t think it &apos;s fair that every year the burden falls on us .
that doesn &apos;t sound like you .
that &apos;s monica talking .
no , we made this decision together .
she &apos;s putting words in your mouth .
don &apos;t you put words in people &apos;s mouths . you put turkey in people &apos;s mouths .
i can &apos;t believe this . this is emma &apos;s first thanksgiving .
no , it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s not ? when was she born ?
well , personally , i think it &apos;s great you &apos;re giving yourself a break .
thank you , phoebe .
sure . it &apos;s just as well .
i mean , last year wasn &apos;t very good . i think she &apos;s losing her touch .
what ? you are way off , lady .
am i ? really ? am i ?
well , why don &apos;t you cook thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong .
well , think about it . you &apos;d be trying to top what you did last year .
you &apos;d be in competition with yourself .
that &apos;s my favorite kind .
okay , we are doing this .
don &apos;t let yourself get manipulated this way .
stay out of this , chandler . this is between me and me .
we are supposed to make these decisions together .
did you not watch the dr. phil i taped for you ?
the.one.with.the.late.thanksgiving
hey .
hi . happy thanksgiving .
happy meatless turkey @-@ murder day .
you guys , i ordered some chocolate pies from that bakery on bleeker .
could you pick them up for me ?
you &apos;re not making the pies ?
i don &apos;t make chocolate pies .
when i was younger , i entered this pie @-@ eating contest .
i ate so many that the thought of them makes me sick .
did you at least win the contest ?
two minutes , twelve pies and a part of one tin .
okay , i &apos;ll see you guys at 4 .
can &apos;t wait .
this dinner is gonna be so great . in your face , last @-@ year me .
hey , rach ?
yeah .
what &apos;s emma doing today ?
well , let &apos;s see , i know that she has a meeting with her lawyer ..
and then she has to make a very big poop .
why ?
i want to enter her in a baby pageant .
oh , my god . that &apos;s the creepiest thing i &apos;ve ever heard .
okay , but before you say no , my friend suzanne is entering her kid .
and compared to emma , she &apos;s a real dog .
phoebe , all babies are beautiful .
oh , okay .
no . phoebe , just the idea of pitting one baby against another ..
i mean , you know , and judging who &apos;s cuter just for a trophy ..
and a thousand dollars .
is something i &apos;m very interested in .
oh , please , do not tell ross .
he still believes that what &apos;s on the inside is important .
okay . and emma needs a cowgirl outfit for the competition .
where am i gonna get a cowgirl outfit on thanksgiving ?
well , i was thinking ..
take the clothes off joey &apos;s cabbage patch kid !
did someone drop the baton again ?
why come all the way from kansas to do that ?
i don &apos;t get older , i just get better .
you know what just occurred to me ?
this could be our last thanksgiving just the two of us .
i mean , we could be getting a baby soon .
you don &apos;t know that .
somebody &apos;s gonna pick us .
but we haven &apos;t heard a thing from the adoption agency .
i &apos;m telling you , it &apos;s gonna happen .
next year , it &apos;s gonna be you , me and little hemingway bing .
what ? he &apos;s my favorite author .
name one of his books .
the firm ?
okay , let &apos;s see . okay , the turkey &apos;s in the oven . the stuffing is ready .
you know , you always cook this meal all by yourself . let me help this year .
oh , chandler , that &apos;s sweet .
but you don &apos;t have to do everything dr. phil tells you to do .
i &apos;m serious , let me do something . just not the turkey . nothing high @-@ profile .
okay , let &apos;s see . oh , the cranberry sauce .
it &apos;s easy to make , and no one really cares about it .
tell me more .
i &apos;m gonna go check on something across the hall . you start by washing these .
not with soap !
you obviously haven &apos;t tasted my palmolive potatoes .
hi . hey , guess what joey has .
three tickets to today &apos;s rangers game !
dude , i wanted him to guess .
oh , my god .
yeah , they &apos;re great seats too .
guess where they are .
center ice .
did i do something to you ?
the game &apos;s at 1 .
so ?
dinner &apos;s at 4 . we &apos;ll never make it back .
so we &apos;ll leave before it &apos;s over .
but it could take us a long time to get back home .
plus , joey could get lost and they could have to page us to go pick him up .
dude , two times that happened !
look , monica &apos;s been working hard all day .
she didn &apos;t want to host in the first place . we shouldn &apos;t go .
he &apos;s right , man .
yeah , i guess . so we &apos;ll see you at 4 .
okay .
and get ready to taste my very special cranberries .
or should i say &quot; chan @-@ berries &quot; ?
that &apos;s some gentle comedy , dude .
we &apos;re still going to the game , right ?
yeah .
hey .
phoebe , listen , i think we gotta go .
this place is freaking me out .
i &apos;ve been watching this guy over there . i don &apos;t think he came with a kid .
but we can &apos;t leave now .
there was this one baby , haley , who was favored to win ..
she got croup , so she had to stay home .
this competition just blew wide @-@ open , folks .
phoebe , it &apos;s just too weird .
i just saw a 1 @-@ year @-@ old with pantyhose on .
oh , i know . we should &apos;ve been more prepared .
it &apos;s okay . now , the way i see it , our real competition now is cameron .
my god , they just took her sweater off .
look at those arms . hello , michelin man .
phoebe , come on . you know what , it &apos;s already 3 : 00 .
they haven &apos;t even gotten to emma &apos;s group yet . we got dinner .
but emma &apos;s got what it takes . she could go all the way !
phoebe , you have to calm down .
okay .
rachel , the hottest babies in the tri @-@ state area are in this room right now .
i overheard a judge say that not one of them holds a candle to emma .
really ?
yeah .
you heard him say that ?
yeah .
all right . okay . all right , let &apos;s give these babies something to cry about .
good . let &apos;s get down to business . emma needs some makeup .
what ?
she &apos;s gonna look washed @-@ out next to the others .
no , i &apos;m not letting you put makeup on my baby .
why not ?
because i already did .
you suck ! get off the ice , you idiot !
what a game .
i know . yeah .
i can &apos;t believe chandler &apos;s missing this .
i &apos;m sorry he &apos;s not here .
but i gotta say , i am really enjoying nacho chair .
yeah , i &apos;d probably enjoy it more if you didn &apos;t keep batting my hand away .
yeah !
these seats are great .
i know , i know . when i was here for &quot; holidays on lce .. &quot;
i was sitting so far away , michelle kwan couldn &apos;t read my banner .
dude , i &apos;m sure she knows you heart her .
i hope so .
we &apos;d better get going . if we don &apos;t leave now , we &apos;re gonna be late .
but it &apos;s a tie game . so we &apos;re a little late . the girls will be there .
let &apos;s just stay for one more goal .
i don &apos;t know .
one more fight .
okay .
okay .
where is everybody ? they &apos;re 45 minutes late .
i can &apos;t believe they &apos;re not here . i slave and i slave for what ?
they &apos;ve ruined cranberry day .
how late are we ?
forty @-@ five minutes .
here .
okay .
rachel and phoebe are already there , so they probably started without us .
we could just slip in , and no one needs to know where we were .
you may want to lose the foam finger .
oh , no , no , no .
you just want to put it on your hand .
you &apos;re not at thanksgiving ?
no , we &apos;re late .
what are you doing here ?
we &apos;re late too .
we figured we could be late because you &apos;d be on time .
don &apos;t point that thing at me , tribbiani .
nobody &apos;s here ? monica &apos;s gonna kill us .
yeah , where were you ?
well ..
yeah , what &apos;s with the trophy ?
well , we were at a spelling bee .
and i won .
you won an adult thanksgiving day spelling bee ?
yes . y @-@ e @-@ s. yes .
let me see this . &quot; grand supreme little darling , new york division &quot; ?
that &apos;s me .
you entered emma in a beauty pageant ?
and it looks like she put makeup on her .
wait a second . where have i seen that cowgirl outfit before ?
i can &apos;t believe this . she &apos;s our daughter .
that you would treat her like some kind of show dog is inexcusable .
she won a thousand dollars .
so this is an annual thing ?
that &apos;s alicia may emory &apos;s outfit !
guys , there are people in there who are not getting any happier .
what are we gonna do ?
i gotta put emma down for a nap .
and , rach , while you &apos;re in there , throw something on alicia may .
all right , what are we gonna say ?
we &apos;ll say that we were mugged .
you can &apos;t get mad at someone who &apos;s been mugged .
good . but you don &apos;t look like you were mugged .
no . here .
hey !
do you hear something ?
they &apos;re out there .
let me see .
i can &apos;t believe this . they &apos;re an hour late , and they &apos;re just standing there talking .
everything &apos;s so distorted . it looks like joey has a giant hand .
that says &quot; rangers &quot; on it . they went to the game .
oh , they are in for a world of pain .
ross &apos; shirt is torn .
they &apos;re late and they &apos;re sloppy .
all right , emma &apos;s napping . what happened to your shirt ?
i got mugged , and they stole my pocket .
we &apos;re just trying to figure out an excuse .
how about this ?
we could say that monica told us 5 : 00 , not 4 : 00 . that way we &apos;re right on time .
or we could plant pcp in the apartment and call the cops on her .
that would be a good way to get rid of all the pcp we have lying around .
we &apos;ll just say that she said it was 5 : 00 .
we &apos;ll just act casual . we &apos;re not late , we &apos;re right on time .
&quot; we know you &apos;re out there . &quot;
who do you think it &apos;s from ?
oh , god , this is bad . this is so bad .
well , let &apos;s just go in there and face them .
i &apos;m not going in first . i bet that vein on monica &apos;s forehead is popping like crazy .
i hate that thing . it &apos;s like a bolt of lightning .
why don &apos;t we play rock , paper , scissors , and whoever loses , goes in first .
all right , i &apos;m in .
ready .
i win .
what is that ?
that &apos;s fire . it beats everything .
oh , really ? does it beat water balloon ?
well @-@ played , phoebe buffay . well @-@ played .
all right , let &apos;s all go in at the same time .
okay .
okay .
it &apos;s locked .
what ? oh , sure , now they lock it .
when they &apos;re having sex on the couch , it &apos;s like :
&quot; come on in , my butt is surprisingly hairy ! &quot;
all right , come on . all right , you guys , we &apos;re so sorry we &apos;re late .
please let us in so we can have dinner together .
no , everything &apos;s cold . the turkey &apos;s dried out and the stuffing &apos;s all soggy .
yeah , and there &apos;s a bowl of cranberry sauce that &apos;s ..
what happens to cranberry sauce ?
nothing , it &apos;s fine .
oh , thank god .
come on , you guys , we &apos;re sorry . our subway broke down .
that &apos;s a lie ! you went to the game . i can see joey &apos;s hand .
for the love of god , take it off !
guys , it doesn &apos;t matter why we &apos;re late . we &apos;re all here now .
please let us in so we can have some of your delicious turkey .
i had a dream once about a fax machine that did that .
that &apos;s all the turkey you &apos;re gonna get .
how are we gonna decide who gets this ?
water balloon !
what are we gonna do ? i &apos;m starving .
i just remembered , we do have something to eat .
monica put something in our oven this morning .
you touch that , and you will be sorry !
guys , i &apos;d listen to her . the vein is bigger than i &apos;ve ever seen it !
oh , my god , it &apos;s brussels sprouts !
that &apos;s worse than no food .
all you got was monica &apos;s stinky brussels sprouts .
stinky ?
please let me stay on this side of the door .
oh , i know ! i still have my old key .
we can just unlock the door .
i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s a good idea . they don &apos;t wanna be with us .
i don &apos;t wanna be with them either ..
but it &apos;s thanksgiving , and we should not want to be together together .
if i could just get in there , make a face @-@ to @-@ face apology ..
look them in the eye , i could get them to forgive us .
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m telling you ..
i can do it .
yeah , he can do it .
it all looks so beautiful .
the turkey , the stuffing .
the cranberries .
enough ! a monkey could &apos;ve made them .
hey , listen , guys , we feel really terrible .
he &apos;s doing that weird eye @-@ contact thing .
don &apos;t look at him . don &apos;t look at him .
come on , you guys . we want you to know we &apos;re very , very sorry .
right , guys ?
i feel terrible .
oh , so sorry .
but let &apos;s not ruin this day . you &apos;ve worked so hard .
let &apos;s move past this and try to have a nice meal all together , huh ?
the floating heads do make a good point .
yeah , they do seem to feel pretty bad .
so bad .
so bad .
okay .
okay , you two go get the dessert , and i &apos;ll let you in .
dessert ?
yeah , i asked you and phoebe to pick up the pies . you did remember , right ?
pies . oh , we thought you said &quot; prize . &quot;
here .
&quot; grand supreme little darling &quot; ?
congratulations !
oh , my god , you forgot the pies ? well , i cannot believe this .
you forced me to make dinner , you &apos;re an hour late ..
and you forget the one little thing that i asked you to do .
really , girls , not cool .
well , you man @-@ heads aren &apos;t any better . you lied about going to the game .
you knew it &apos;d make you late , and you went anyway .
hey , i &apos;m getting a little tired of this . we said we &apos;re sorry .
it &apos;s thanksgiving , for pete &apos;s sakes ! a day of forgiveness .
it &apos;s a day to be thankful .
don &apos;t make me come up there !
it &apos;s too late for apologies .
fine , let &apos;s just go . i don &apos;t need your stupid dinner .
that would be a lot more convincing if you weren &apos;t drooling .
oh , is that what that is ?
sorry .
come on , you guys , let &apos;s just do our own thanksgiving .
yeah , i &apos;ll cook .
yeah , let &apos;s go out .
yeah , you three have a nice thanksgiving .
the three of us ?
yeah . you , chan and the vein .
i &apos;m stuck .
joey , that is not gonna work .
no , seriously .
i &apos;m really wedged in here .
i &apos;ll pull you through .
okay .
stop , stop , i &apos;m worried about damaging my head .
it &apos;s a little late for that .
hurry up , you gotta do something .
all right , well , this does not change anything .
we need to get something to grease his face .
we got turkey grease .
bring it .
i just want to say that i &apos;m sorry i referred to the vein as a separate person .
here you go .
oh , that smells good .
okay ?
okay , try it .
it isn &apos;t working .
we &apos;re gonna have to unscrew the chain .
hurry , i can &apos;t feel my ears .
can you ever feel your ears ?
interesting .
chandler , where are your tools ?
oh , i left them on my bulldozer .
i don &apos;t have tools .
well , i do , but rachel borrowed them .
i lent them to ross .
i gave them to joey .
i left them at the park .
i &apos;m finding it really hard not to mess with him .
i stuffed brussels sprouts down his pants .
nice .
okay , i have to get that .
now , when i get back , i want you and your friends to be gone .
thanksgiving is over . the vein has spoken .
it &apos;s really starting to hurt .
look , i &apos;m gonna pull on the door ..
and you guys push . maybe we can get enough room to wiggle him out , okay ?
okay , so push .
just a sec . we &apos;re kind of in the middle of something here .
hey , stop putting things down my pants .
come on , guys , push !
yeah , come on , push !
push ! push !
my cranberries !
man , i got food all over me .
i can &apos;t believe what you did . monica &apos;s gonna kill you .
look ! look ! look what the .. look what the floating heads did !
i don &apos;t care .
what &apos;s going on ?
that was the adoption agency .
and ?
we &apos;re getting a baby !
are you serious ? !
there &apos;s a pregnant woman in ohio , and she picked us .
oh , my god , that &apos;s great !
that &apos;s incredible .
i &apos;m so happy for you .
this thanksgiving kicks last thanksgiving &apos;s ass !
to monica and chandler and that knocked @-@ up girl in ohio .
i &apos;m just so happy you guys are finally getting a kid .
i know . have you considered pageanting ?
i can &apos;t believe they called . i mean , we &apos;re actually getting a baby .
i know how you feel .
really ?
sure .
i went through the exact same thing with alicia may emory .
the waiting , the wondering .
then one day , i get that call from toys &quot; r &quot; us .
she was in stock .
