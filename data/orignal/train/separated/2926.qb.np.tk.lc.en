oh ! hey , rach !
hi .
happy valentine &apos;s day !
you too !
how &apos;s living at ross &apos; ?
it &apos;s good , except he makes us watch the discovery channel all day long .
something really boring happened to someone ugly in the middle ages .
oh , thank you . i &apos;ll see you guys later .
that is one lucky to @-@ go cup of coffee .
i wish you would get over her . i hate seeing you like this .
is there anything i can do for you ? do you wanna look down my top ?
thanks . maybe later .
gunther , can i get a scone ?
want anything ?
i want a lot of things .
i wanna be with the woman i love on valentine &apos;s day .
i want her to love me back .
and i want relief from the wrenching pain of knowing that won &apos;t happen !
we have red bagels .
okay .
the.one.with.the.birthing.video
so how do you guys like living together so far ?
oh , it &apos;s been good .
yeah .
except ross is more uptight about crumbs than you are .
there was a drumstick in the couch .
and i am not uptight about crumbs .
it &apos;s just that , you know ..
crumbs attract mice . and mice leave droppings .
and that &apos;s how the plague started .
so you wanna relive that again ..
mice didn &apos;t start the plague .
rats did .
rattus norvegicus , to be exact .
oh , good god , ross .
nick at nite , once in a while .
all right , i &apos;m going . bye .
phoebe , will you wait here ?
i wanna get your opinion on something .
yeah .
how does mona feel about rachel moving in ?
i &apos;m on my way to tell her .
she &apos;s been away all week , but she &apos;ll be cool .
she &apos;s been so supportive .
she even got the baby a t @-@ shirt that says &quot; fossils are my friends . &quot;
come on , mona . don &apos;t kiss ass .
so i &apos;m gonna take off .
oh , shoot ! oh , shoot ! rachel wanted to see this tape .
what is it ?
my friend giving birth .
could you take it to your apartment ?
&quot; candy and cookie &quot; ?
candy &apos;s the mom , cookie &apos;s the daughter .
the father &apos;s name is also cookie .
why am i friends with these people ?
phoebe , come here .
i wanna show you something in the bathroom .
monica , grow up .
what &apos;s behind your back ?
something i want phoebe &apos;s opinion on .
you don &apos;t want my opinion ?
not really .
come on , i &apos;m your older brother . ask me .
okay , big brother .
which one would make your best friend want to do your little sister ?
the red one .
hey .
i know you &apos;re depressed , so i brought someone to cheer you up .
right outside is a real , live , furry playmate .
i &apos;m not sleeping with your friend jane again .
hey , a dog !
who , you gotta admit , looks a lot like jane .
he &apos;s the happiest dog ever . i borrowed him from my friend wendy .
so you can keep him till he cheers you up .
i borrow him myself from time to time ..
when i get depressed thinking about ..
world hunger , poverty ..
not to trivialize your pain .
thanks so much , pheebs . we are gonna have so much fun !
oh , not that kind of fun .
happy valentine &apos;s !
i &apos;m slipping into something a bit less comfortable and a bit more slutty .
&quot; candy and cookie &quot; ?
&quot; candy and cookie &quot; ? !
monica got me porn ?
girl @-@ on @-@ girl porn ? !
she really must love me !
yeah , just relax .
i love you , st. valentine .
whoa , whoa , that &apos;s not pretty .
now push !
oh , god , it hurts !
worst porn ever ! worst porn ever !
oh , make it stop !
i am trying !
get the ball . ready ? get the ball !
you &apos;re cute , but you &apos;re not too smart .
did i just throw this ?
hi .
hi .
i accidentally packed these with my stuff .
who is this ?
phoebe &apos;s friend &apos;s dog .
i don &apos;t know his real name . i call him mozzarella .
you are so cute . i wish i could play , but i &apos;ve gotta go to work .
i hope i stop talking like this before my meeting . yes , i do .
bye @-@ bye , joey . seriously , i can &apos;t stop it .
come here ! hey !
that &apos;s rachel . she used to live here .
might as well be honest with you . we love her .
but we can &apos;t have her .
i really miss her .
hey , you understand , right ? you &apos;re a guy .
well , you used to be .
so , what do you think ?
i &apos;ve still got it .
why did you get me this ?
what is it ?
it &apos;s yelling , bleeding , dilating .
oh , the dilating !
is this the video of the birth ? it &apos;s phoebe &apos;s . why were you watching it ?
i thought maybe you got me porn for valentine &apos;s day .
if you thought i was gonna get you porn for valentine &apos;s day ..
you were right .
it &apos;s about a girl who moves to the city in search of stardom ..
but ends up having sex with a lot of guys .
it got four stars .
wait a minute . those aren &apos;t stars .
anyway , you wanna take a look ?
well ..
i &apos;m not really in a sexy mood .
hey , what &apos;s going on ?
remember the first time you saw jaws ..
how long it took to go back in the water ?
we can &apos;t let this tape wreck valentine &apos;s day .
you gotta get past it .
just get back on the horse .
otherwise , the horse is gonna go into the bedroom and change into her sweatpants .
okay , you don &apos;t know . you didn &apos;t see it .
childbirth is beautiful .
oh , beautiful ? really ?
you think this is beautiful ?
oh , my god ! no wonder my mother hates me !
see , honey , there &apos;s ..
don &apos;t touch me !
hi !
hey !
how was atlantic city ?
good .
i brought you back a present .
you didn &apos;t have to ..
saltwater taffy ? !
thanks .
interestingly , it isn &apos;t made with seawater .
it &apos;s actually made with salted fresh water .
that &apos;s not interesting .
i think it &apos;s interesting .
me too . i missed you !
me too .
how was your week ?
good .
the baby started kicking .
how exciting !
it was amazing . the only thing is , i wasn &apos;t there the first time .
oh , no .
i was missing out on all this stuff .
joey suggested rachel move in with me .
yeah , right .
what ?
joey cracks me up .
&quot; have your ex @-@ wife move in . that wouldn &apos;t be awkward . &quot;
imagine , i go away for a few days ..
and my boyfriend is living with a woman he got pregnant .
so , what &apos;d you tell him ?
you didn &apos;t tell mona rachel moved in ?
she seemed to think it was such a crazy idea .
plus , she got me taffy .
really ? i &apos;ve never had any .
ever ?
my mom was too busy planning her suicide to provide saltwater treats .
thank you .
are you gonna tell her ?
i will . i want to butter her up first .
i &apos;m gonna take her to dinner , do all this romantic stuff .
when she thinks i &apos;m the best boyfriend ever ..
i &apos;ll tell her my pregnant ex @-@ girlfriend is living with me .
if i haven &apos;t said it before , she &apos;s a lucky , lucky lady .
so where are .. ? what the crap is up with this stuff ?
is it gum ? is it food ? what &apos;s the deal ?
oh , it &apos;s nice . may i try a pink one ?
so i just have to plan the perfect night .
hey , what &apos;s the best date you ever had ?
last year , greg hayman took me to a very nice sushi dinner .
then we took a romantic walk to a nearby research lab ..
where we trashed the place and freed 20 monkeys .
i knew it ! i knew i wasn &apos;t crazy !
last year , a monkey did attack me at the bus stop !
so between her and me being friends , and her history with ross ..
it just isn &apos;t gonna happen .
it &apos;d be like you falling in love with a cat .
hey .
hey .
how &apos;s my favorite dog , huh ? how &apos;s my favorite dog ?
you &apos;re subdued .
did you give him a beer ?
no .
will you excuse us ? we need to talk .
sure .
oh , me , right .
he &apos;s miserable . what happened to him ?
nothing .
we talked about stuff .
what stuff ?
rachel stuff .
oh , joey , you bummed him out ! this is the happiest dog in the world .
he spends a day with you , and look !
he &apos;s breathing .
okay , well , he &apos;s watching us so just look happy , okay ?
i &apos;ll take him to wendy &apos;s .
he &apos;s fine .
look .
here &apos;s your ball !
get your ball ! get your ball !
get ..
of course .
you don &apos;t want a tennis ball .
not when you can have a meatball .
come on , get the meatball .
god , what have i done to you ?
i broke the dog , pheebs ! i broke the dog !
thanks .
i &apos;m going to pick up mona . what are you doing tonight ?
oh , i got big valentine &apos;s plans .
i got my chinese food on the way , and your saltwater taffy .
interestingly , it isn &apos;t made with seawater ..
we actually watched the documentary together .
oh , my chinese food . i &apos;ll get my cash .
mona ?
what are .. ? hi ! how are you ?
i &apos;m supposed to pick you up .
i made you a valentine &apos;s dinner . surprise !
oh ! hey , mona !
hi , rachel .
what &apos;s she doing here ?
i have no idea .
i &apos;ll be watching tv if anybody needs me .
what is she doing ?
lately she just likes hanging out here .
why ?
i think she &apos;s lonely .
but it &apos;s valentine &apos;s day . can &apos;t we ask her to go ?
well , no , she &apos;s way too emotional .
and by emotional , i mean crazy !
that &apos;s just my chinese food .
she has food delivered here ?
yes , she &apos;s emotional , but ballsy .
i &apos;m gonna get in my sweats and eat this in bed .
and you thought she was gonna be in our way !
open the champagne , and i will be right back .
i &apos;ve got a surprise .
you got another ex @-@ wife back there ?
please start drinking .
i &apos;m just gonna grab the phone .
rachel , wait .
i hope you don &apos;t take this the wrong way .
what are you doing ?
do you need the phone ?
no .
ross is too nice to say it , but this is his apartment .
we need boundaries , so why don &apos;t you go back to your place .
but , mona , i live here .
happy valentine &apos;s day !
or , something to remember me by .
how long has it been this time ?
ninety seconds .
ninety seconds is a long time not to think about it .
except all i did was think about it .
i know . it haunts me .
till now , the worst thing i &apos;d seen was my dad doing shots off the houseboy .
after this , i would gladly make that my screen saver .
we have to get past this . we &apos;ll pretend it never existed .
i could do that .
now all we gotta do is get rid of this chair .
oh , thank god !
i know .
come in !
hi . i &apos;m sorry to barge in on your valentine .
i had to get away from the yelling . mona &apos;s dumping ross .
oh , my god .
poor ross .
we watch him do yoga in his underwear , but for this he closes the drapes .
you know that birthing tape you wanted to see ?
it &apos;s here .
we should warn you before you watch it . don &apos;t watch it .
you saw it ? is it scary ?
it &apos;s ironic how footage of someone being born ..
can make you want to kill yourself .
honey , she may not have to watch it but she &apos;s going to have to do it .
now i &apos;m all freaked out . will you watch it with me ?
no , but i &apos;ll leave a sweater that smells like me right next to you .
monica , come on . you want to have kids .
i do .
but the stork is gonna bring mine .
seriously , you &apos;re not gonna make me watch this alone .
she &apos;s right . of course not .
honey , get the tape .
this reminds me of a very specific part of the tape .
oh , sure . but if you leave a drumstick under there and you &apos;re a bad roommate .
here we go .
okay .
oh , my .
come on , come on .
why is that baby torturing that woman ?
why have i seen this thing three times ?
it &apos;s beautiful .
it &apos;s horrible !
i know , i know ! i &apos;m so sorry for you !
what do i do ? i don &apos;t want to do this ! how do i get out of it ?
you guys ! you guys , look !
what ? did her ass explode ?
no , the baby &apos;s out . look .
look at those little fingers and toes .
look how happy the mom is now .
oh , rach .
screw you ! you don &apos;t have to do it !
hey .
hey !
what &apos;s up ?
mona just dumped me .
oh , man , i &apos;m sorry . why ?
lately , i haven &apos;t exactly been the perfect boyfriend .
i didn &apos;t tell her i got rachel pregnant .
i gave her a key to my apartment and then had the locks changed .
then i lied to her about rachel moving in with me .
in a way , i judge her for not breaking up with me sooner .
that really sucks . especially on valentine &apos;s day .
wait a minute . what are you doing here ?
joey without a date on valentine &apos;s day ?
what &apos;s going on , huh ? girl trouble ?
sort of .
really ?
you don &apos;t have to seem so happy about it .
maybe i can help .
whatever it is , i am sure it has happened to me .
you know , actually , once i got dumped during sex .
so anyway , what is it ?
forget about it . it &apos;s no big deal .
come on , what is it ?
it &apos;s nothing .
hey , it &apos;s me . why can &apos;t you tell me ?
okay . sit down .
there &apos;s this woman that i like a lot .
but it can &apos;t happen .
she &apos;s not a tribbiani ?
no !
so is she someone from work ?
yes .
well , does she like you ?
sometimes i think she could .
but i can &apos;t do anything about it .
why not ?
it &apos;s complicated .
she was with this other guy for a long time .
someone from work too .
i could never do that to the guy . we &apos;re friends .
wait , i thought you hated everyone at work .
no , no . i only say that ..
so chandler won &apos;t feel threatened because i &apos;m his only friend .
excuse me ?
sorry , sorry . and i &apos;m your only friend too .
so this guy she used to go out with , is he still in love with her ?
no , i don &apos;t think so .
okay .
is he a good guy ?
yeah , he &apos;s the best .
then talk to him .
i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s worth finding out , if you like her .
i do , so much .
i can &apos;t stop thinking about her . i can &apos;t sleep ..
you know what ? you have to go for it .
how often does this happen to you ? you owe it to yourself .
here &apos;s your warm milk .
i &apos;m gonna put the bourbon in it at home .
anyway , seriously , just talk to the guy , okay ?
let me know how it goes .
it &apos;s rachel .
you &apos;re having a baby and you need to prepare .
you &apos;re gonna make yourself watch the whole thing . just do it !
i came to the big city to become a star .
i &apos;ll do anything to make that happen .
anything ?
maybe it starts with how she gets pregnant .
i wonder which one of these guys becomes the father .
