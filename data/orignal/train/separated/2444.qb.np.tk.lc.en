i get that we had an amazing life together ,
but now i feel like i &apos;m looking at a stranger .
to get home , we &apos;ll harness the power of the eclipse
using an ascendant .
what about bonnie ?
she sacrificed herself so i could come back .
jo is his sister ?
in our coven , kai wanted to be the leader .
but that wasn &apos;t possible if lukas and olivia were alive .
i &apos;m not going to let you die .
if kai gets out , he &apos;ll head straight for jo .
his ability to siphon magic will overwhelm jo ,
and our coven will be left to the whims of a madman .
to do the spell , all i need is bennett blood .
the bastard took the car .
the ascendant &apos;s with me .
we &apos;re not letting her brother out , all right ?
the ascendant is off the table .
ok . get the ascendant from jo .
i understand .
look . i &apos;m at a crossroads .
any chance you &apos;d be willing to help me
bring my best friend bonnie back ?
sure .
knock knock .
hey . come on in .
oh . it &apos;s one of those nights .
your enthusiasm is amazing .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;ve had a day from hell ,
and i didn &apos;t mean it .
i did actually , but i &apos;m gonna call take backs , ok ?
ok .
ooh , you got thai food .
you know , i knew i should have led with the food .
well , this is perfect . i &apos;m starving .
where &apos;s yours ?
oh . very funny .
you didn &apos;t compel him to get her drunk .
no . i compelled him to do whatever it takes ,
and considering the ascendant is the key
to her psycho brother &apos;s weird prison world ,
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s gonna take her a few to open up about it .
i swear your dad loves me .
i have never been given so clear a blessing .
you went to see him , and he tried to kill me .
how &apos;s that a blessing ?
because he didn &apos;t try to kill me .
he just banished me from your creepy childhood home .
it wasn &apos;t creepy back then .
once your brother brutally murders your siblings ,
creep sets in .
oh . so you just-- you just ran .
i didn &apos;t run . they let me go .
we made a deal . betray your brother
and get your freedom .
so where does the ascendant fall under this deal ?
they didn &apos;t know i had it .
by the time i found out , i was gone .
i still don &apos;t understand why you &apos;d want it .
it makes me feel safe , like i &apos;m in control .
as long as i have it , then no one can use it to get kai out .
kai can &apos;t get me .
embarrassing , but i actually used sleep with it under my pillow .
used to ?
yes , used to . i am a grownup now obviously ,
and i keep it in my underwear drawer next to my pot .
oh , ok . well , that explains why you &apos;re always hungry .
no . i &apos;m always hungry because i &apos;m a vegetarian .
there you go . the last of it .
good .
no more distractions .
you realize he is gonna kill you
when he finds out what you did to him .
my relationship to ruin , thank you .
i didn &apos;t complain when you ruined yours with caroline .
i didn &apos;t ruin my--
yeah . i &apos;m sure she &apos;s fine .
she &apos;s on vacation with her mom ,
eating ice cream out of the carton ,
convincing herself she never liked you in the first place .
you done ?
careful , stefan .
i know it may seem easy to be the big bad salvatore ,
but soon , you &apos;ll find yourself lying in the middle of the road ,
pouring your heart out to a stranger ,
having an existential crisis .
yeah , great . so , uh , when &apos;s this grand theft gonna happen ?
assuming everything went well ,
it &apos;s already happened , which means ...
here it is .
thanks , buddy .
there you go .
go home to jo , be a good boyfriend ,
forget this ever happened .
seriously , i shouldn &apos;t be winning .
two weeks without booze doesn &apos;t make you iron man .
i can still vamp circles around you .
you mean , you can cheat .
or i could pants you in front of the entire women &apos;s volleyball team .
doubt they &apos;d mind .
ok . i give up .
what did you do with my miserable half @-@ drunk brother ?
he canceled bonnie &apos;s cell phone ,
cried until there was nothing left ,
and got all the grief out of his system .
he is ready to move on .
what ?
it &apos;s about bonnie .
damon said she found peace .
he thought kai had killed her ,
but he just found out that she &apos;s alive ,
and he &apos;s doing everything that he can to--
so you &apos;re back to defending him . wow !
and all it took was one hollow promise to bring bonnie back .
no . no , no , no , jer . it &apos;s not hollow .
liv &apos;s looking for a way to send us over there
so that we can find bonnie and bring her back .
and if you can &apos;t ?
jer , this is good news .
you &apos;re right , elena . this is good news .
tonight , i &apos;m gonna see bonnie again ,
and everything is gonna go back to the way it was
because i have never heard that before .
i brought you to mystic falls to keep you safe
from your crazy @-@ ass witch family .
you can &apos;t just leave because damon wants you to do some spell .
so , what , i &apos;m a prisoner here ?
do i look like rapunzel ?
actually .
look . why can &apos;t luke do it ?
because he is busy enjoying his last few weeks
as a singular twin
with his sugar daddy radiologist ,
and i &apos;d like to enjoy mine .
matt , help me out here .
i can &apos;t . it &apos;s for bonnie .
tyler , i can &apos;t stay locked up in here any longer .
i &apos;m out of clothes , and i &apos;ve had pizza for breakfast
every day this week .
we &apos;ve got to get back to our normal lives .
if you leave and your coven finds you--
they &apos;ll make me merge with my brother ?
it &apos;s not all bad .
if i survive , you &apos;ll be dating
the all @-@ powerful leader of the gemini coven ,
and if i don &apos;t , you can date luke .
this isn &apos;t a joke to me , ok ?
well , i have to laugh at it
because if i start imagining my life stuck in this town
running away from my family ,
i will fall apart .
i &apos;ll find a way .
and that was an actual fight two people just had
over a twin @-@ merge ?
this town is so weird .
you &apos;ll get used to it .
or i won &apos;t , and a vampire will kill me
like they killed your friend tripp .
that &apos;s not gonna happen because i won &apos;t let it .
and with that , the mystic falls community protection program
is officially disbanded .
you know what that means .
i helped you , now you help me .
time for a little family reunion .
what does matt want with stefan ?
i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s matt .
food , money , new social class .
whatever it is , it better distract stefan
from his sizeable screw @-@ up with caroline .
did you know about that , how she felt about him ?
she told me a little while back ,
and whatever you &apos;re thinking ,
i want both of them to be happy .
even if she compels away all the things she likes about him ?
thanks for doing this .
don &apos;t worry about .
i needed an excuse to get out of that frat house .
way too much boy . gross .
you got everything ?
yep . blood from a bennett--
lucy to be exact--
and an ascendant from whatever the hell your last name is .
parker .
so this is the famous ascendant ?
yup .
surprised that jo gave it up .
why ?
it &apos;s the only thing keeping kai locked in his prison .
if he gets out , he &apos;s coming after jo .
well , good old jo-- heh heh--helping us out .
can we do this , please ?
whatever . so i &apos;m gonna need the moon to activate the ascendant .
it will be viable for about 8 hours ,
so once i send you over , the clock &apos;s ticking .
and how do we get back ?
drink these .
what is that ?
it &apos;s my blood . it will link you to me
so i can find you and bring you back .
give this one to bonnie , too .
are you waiting for a toast ?
drink .
bitter . wonder why .
shall we ?
i used to come here every day
after the accident for months .
this is where your parents are buried .
yeah , but not in 1994 .
in 1994 , they were still alive .
yeah . so is bonnie .
so let &apos;s go get her .
just keep your eyes peeled .
there &apos;s a pork rind @-@ munching freak somewhere around here .
ok ?
yeah .
come on .
you ever worn skinny jeans ?
it seems wrong .
i &apos;m all bunched up .
also , why are jeans so tight when phones are so big ?
i don &apos;t know what to tell you , pal .
oh , god . i &apos;m that guy , right ?
that guy that won &apos;t shut up .
oh , i hate that guy .
i just sat next to that guy on the plane .
he was the worst .
speaking of planes , have you flown recently ?
because what &apos;s with the whole liquid situation
and the stripping before you go through security thing ?
it &apos;s weird .
they &apos;re worried about terrorists .
ok . well , i &apos;m sorry , but the real terrorists
are some of those people taking off their shoes .
i know i &apos;m chatty . sorry .
i &apos;ve just been in prison for awhile .
not like a regular prison , you know , more like a ...
all right . we &apos;re here .
special kind of ...
that will be 30 .
all right .
jeans .
uh , will you take this ?
hang on . hang on . i got it .
gum . nice .
come on , buddy . i don &apos;t have all day . let &apos;s go .
i got it . hold on .
i guess this will do .
thank you .
bonnie ?
nothing . you ?
no , and i looked in every room
plus the basement .
damon , you--you don &apos;t think that kai--
look . let &apos;s not jump to depressing conclusions yet , ok ?
ok .
oh , my god . damon .
oh , my god , damon . this is blood .
and we &apos;re jumping .
what are you doing ?
if kai has bonnie , we need to talk .
so you &apos;re gonna call him ?
i &apos;m gonna page him actually .
sorry . forgot you were two in 1994 .
pagers are an ancient form of telecommunication .
i know what a pager is .
how does it work ?
we dial jackass &apos;s number 555 @-@ hiya @-@ kai ...
we leave our number ...
and then we hang up .
and now what ?
and now we sit by the phone like a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl
and wait .
relax .
i &apos;m about to meet one of my only living relatives .
uh , technically , he &apos;s not living .
so stefan has extended family .
i &apos;m intrigued .
enzo , what the hell are you doing here ?
apparently rescuing this one from the world &apos;s most dreadful lunch .
matt and stefan ? sweetheart , you can do so much better .
me for example . i &apos;m enzo .
the guy who killed tripp .
oh , my god .
for the record ,
he did try and kill me first .
you are the most terrible wingman .
enzo , leave .
or what ?
or maybe i &apos;ll pick up where tripp left off .
go on then .
hey . i really wouldn &apos;t do that if i were you .
you hurt him , and , uh , i hurt you ,
and really don &apos;t feel like cleaning up two corpses today .
making threats in front of impressionable family .
how brutish .
what are you talking about ?
me .
he &apos;s , uh , talking about me .
i &apos;m zach and gail &apos;s daughter sarah salvatore .
i am officially in hell .
this place is my own personal hell .
what was that ?
uh , it &apos;s my audition tape for &quot; real world : london . &quot;
fingers crossed . i think i &apos;m finally gonna make it .
that was a video journal .
what ? no . journals are lame ,
especially video ones .
then why did you say you thought this was your own personal hell ?
well , i mean , because i was stuck here with bonnie .
what could be worse than that ?
damon .
kai , if you so much as hurt one hair
on her annoying little witch head ,
i will kill you and--
that was so sweet .
why &apos;d you ruin it by calling me annoying ?
bonnie ?
elena ?
elena , is that you ?
yes ! it &apos;s me . i &apos;m here .
i &apos;m at the salvatore house in ... in 1994 .
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m hearing your voice right now .
how are you here ?
it &apos;s a long story .
just know that i &apos;m here to get you .
so kai just left you in portland ?
after cooking me thanksgiving spaghetti and stealing my blood .
it &apos;s been a strange few days .
where is he now ?
don &apos;t know . i hotwired a car ,
and i &apos;m on my way back to mystic falls .
hang on . you hotwired a car ?
who are you ?
a badass apparently .
a badass in muncie .
well , muncie &apos;s about 6.1 / 2 hours away ,
give or take a knuckle .
liv &apos;s pulling us out in 7 .
if you don &apos;t stop to use the little witches &apos; room anymore .
i can make it in time .
i &apos;m going home .
you &apos;re coming home .
we &apos;ll see you soon .
ok .
you &apos;re worried about kai .
if he &apos;s got bonnie &apos;s blood and the ascendant ,
he &apos;s got everything he needs to get out .
what if he &apos;s already out ?
how can i help you ?
one zima , please .
hilarious .
are you going to order something
or just gonna stare ?
ok . uh , how about a soda ...
liv ?
liv . ironic .
where is it ?
that &apos;s a cryptic question ,
accusatory tone .
this doesn &apos;t bode well for me .
good . deflect , make a joke .
that &apos;ll fix this .
what are you talking about ?
the ascendant .
where is it ?
i have no idea .
you must think i &apos;m an idiot .
to be fair , i am one .
wine , thai food , that &apos;s all it takes .
jo , i don &apos;t have it .
did you tell damon where it is ?
no . no .
look . we all agreed to find another way to get bonnie back .
do you honestly think this is my normal afternoon reading ?
you and i are the only ones who knew where it was .
it &apos;s gone !
ok . look . i swear to you
i didn &apos;t tell anyone , ok ?
i would never tell anybody .
you &apos;re right . you &apos;d never tell anyone .
it doesn &apos;t mean you didn &apos;t .
what are you saying ?
damon is a vampire .
are you saying damon compelled me ?
look . he wouldn &apos;t do that .
he &apos;s my friend .
ok . let &apos;s prove it . we &apos;re going to mystic falls .
if you &apos;re compelled , it will go away
when we walk across the border .
if nothing happens , then you &apos;re right .
he &apos;s your friend .
bon appetit .
hang on .
what ?
nothing . let &apos;s eat .
ok . who mangled the crossword ?
6 letters , illiterate witch , b.
this is about kai and jo .
yep . kai &apos;s greatest hits staring us in the face every day .
if kai &apos;s out , he &apos;s gonna go after jo again .
damon , he &apos;s gonna kill her .
well , if i have my gemini rules down ,
actually , he &apos;s going to merge with her ,
which will most likely result in her death ,
which i guess is 6 of 1--
then why would she give you the ascendant ?
because i asked her very nicely ?
you want some music maybe ?
i &apos;m gonna turn on some music .
it was the one thing trapping kai ,
and she just gave it to you ?
we have nirvana , nine inch nails ,
boyz ii men--stefan &apos;s .
damon .
fine .
she didn &apos;t give it to me .
alaric stole it from her .
alaric stole from her .
after i compelled him .
what ?
elena , stop .
of course you compel your best friend .
i mean , why would that be off limits ?
hey . i &apos;m trying to get bonnie back !
oh , just--just--no . don &apos;t .
damon , i want bonnie back more than anything .
she &apos;s my best friend ,
but to you , she &apos;s something else ,
isn &apos;t she ?
she &apos;s a chance for me to realize what a great guy you are
so that i can fall in love with you all over again .
it doesn &apos;t matter who gets hurt in the process
as long as damon gets what damon wants .
she &apos;s saying you &apos;re stupid ,
and stefan is agreeing .
ooh . now she &apos;s saying you &apos;re good for nothing ,
and stefan is disagreeing .
he says you &apos;re a great punch line to a joke .
everyone hates you .
don &apos;t be jealous you can &apos;t vamp hear
because you &apos;re a big blond bowl of mush .
just be thankful i don &apos;t fancy mush .
so after the third group home ,
i got myself emancipated ,
which is surprisingly difficult , by the way .
yeah . you seem like the type that would do better on your own .
hey . do you want a drink ?
sure .
hey . excuse me . can we get two chocolate milk shakes , please ?
it &apos;s a , uh , salvatore family tradition .
i &apos;m all for family traditions .
all right . listen . in 10 seconds ,
you &apos;re gonna get up and walk out of here with me ,
smiling , acting like nothing &apos;s wrong .
the acting part shouldn &apos;t be too hard for you .
i know you &apos;re lying .
ready to go ?
where you guys going ?
oh , just a little family drive .
it &apos;s ok , matt , i promise .
i &apos;ll call you in a bit .
all right .
you on twitter ?
ah . i just signed up . you should follow me .
cobrakai1972 .
come on . like &quot; karate kid &quot; ?
did you know you can follow celebrities ?
they all twitter the stupidest things .
it &apos;s--it &apos;s hilarious .
it &apos;s kind of dead . i think i &apos;m gonna close up .
oh . hang on , hang on .
i &apos;m gonna get a real drink .
no bourbon . i &apos;m secure enough in my masculinity .
vodka &apos;s boring , rum &apos;s too tropical .
ooh . tequila . you do not want to see me on tequila .
what about gin ? is that weird ?
not if you &apos;re a 50 @-@ year @-@ old ,
but seeing as you look 19,
i &apos;m gonna need to see some i.d.
oh . of course . of course .
1972 . nice try .
no . true story ,
but that &apos;s not the most interesting thing on that i.d.
here . look again .
name , address .
malachai parker .
oh , my god . ahhh .
last time i saw you ...
i was trying to kill you .
why don &apos;t we pick up where we left off ?
i don &apos;t think so .
life is so much easier with magic .
feels kind of like cheating .
i &apos;m sad you didn &apos;t recognize me .
that means dad erased all trace of my existence--
family pictures , movies ,
little handprint turkey i made .
what a dick .
you stay the hell away from me .
you were always so bad at hide @-@ and @-@ seek .
i mean , you were 4 , but still ,
find a better hiding spot .
i think she did just fine .
let &apos;s get out of here .
you don &apos;t find it the least bit strange
that they just up and left ?
i told you she &apos;s his family .
if they want to talk , let them talk .
what the hell do you care ?
because i care about the truth ,
care about authenticity .
or you just hate stefan .
i do actually , yeah .
he abandoned his brother ,
turned me over to a vampire hunter ,
and he hurt the one girl who can honestly do no wrong .
that &apos;s not why i care .
no . i care because he does all that
and is still considered a hero
when i get stuck being a villain .
yeah , because you kill people .
what , and stefan doesn &apos;t ?
come on . you and iuse you both know that &apos;s not true .
i &apos;m just up front about it ,
but stefan , no , who knows what he &apos;s done ?
he &apos;s just a liar with a little box of secrets .
come on , mush . let &apos;s open the box .
i told you zach salvatore is my father ,
gail is my mother .
i have these pictures .
ah . that &apos;s your big evidence ,
a picture you stole ?
you gave yourself up the second you got in the car .
why don &apos;t you believe me ?
because right now , sarah salvatore is in her dorm room
at duke university , where she studies as an art major ,
and she didn &apos;t bounce from group home to group home .
she was adopted right out of the hospital by a great family .
i made sure of it .
you know her .
she &apos;s my family .
even though she doesn &apos;t know me ,
i &apos;ve looked out for her
for her entire life .
now who the hell are you ?
monique .
my name is monique .
may 10 , 1994,
i had a day .
i was mad at stefan for something .
i don &apos;t even remember what it was ,
and in typical damon fashion , i acted out .
people died .
a lot of them ,
and believe it or not , ever since that day ,
i &apos;ve felt horribly guilty .
so i thought that this was my hell , elena ...
but you know who didn &apos;t ?
bonnie .
she had hope for both of us .
she &apos;s the reason i survived ,
the reason i made it out .
who knew ? turns out you spend time with someone
and don &apos;t kill them , you actually become friends .
i &apos;m doing this for bonnie , elena , not for you .
and that &apos;s it .
damon and bonnie .
who would have thought ?
don &apos;t make this any weirder than it needs to be .
she &apos;s probably passing whitmore right now .
if she &apos;s not lost .
she has a terrible sense of direction .
you know , i could have sworn that this used to squeak .
it did .
i fixed it .
bonnie and i came here every day .
it as the closest thing i had to a picture of you ,
and i needed every reminder i could get .
it &apos;s funny .
i used to have so many good memories of this house ,
and after just one bad one , i burned it down .
i just couldn &apos;t bear to look at it again .
i just can &apos;t believe it &apos;s gone .
you want to go inside ?
yeah . yeah , i do .
i &apos;m sorry i compelled away the memories .
they were only half mine .
we &apos;ll make new ones .
do you feel that ?
oh , no .
no . no . we shouldn &apos;t be back yet .
damon , we have another hour .
what did you do ?
kai is here . we have to get back to mystic falls
before he takes any more of her magic .
no . send me back first .
i can &apos;t .
bonnie was on her way .
send me back !
elena , you &apos;re over the border .
i &apos;m sorry , elena .
no . no .
i met sarah at sleep @-@ away camp ,
or as my foster family liked to call it ,
get the hell out of my house camp .
sarah had a great life .
me ? not so much .
so when i found out that she had no desire
to find her real family--
you decided to find them for her .
couldn &apos;t be any worse than what i had .
well , considering the fact that my brother killed
her mom while she was pregnant ,
i don &apos;t know about that .
i let him believe that the baby died .
i wanted to protect her .
even though my brother &apos;s not the same person he was before ,
it &apos;s safer if he doesn &apos;t know .
i know that may be a little bit extreme ,
but i want her to have a normal life no matter what .
see , the problem is with you around ,
there &apos;s a thread now ,
someone who knows her other than me .
i &apos;m not gonna hurt you .
i just need you to take off your vervain .
you &apos;ve never met or heard of sarah salvatore .
forget everything that happened here ,
leave virginia , and never come back .
you ok ?
who are you ?
you compelled her ? why ?
she &apos;s not my family , she &apos;s a con artist ,
and i &apos;m just trying to get rid of her .
get out of here .
what the hell ?
no screaming , luv , and don &apos;t move .
enzo , what are you doing ?
i want the whole story ,
the one not obscured by the dulcet tones of a blender .
i told you she &apos;s a con artist .
there is no sarah salvatore .
that baby died when damon killed her mom .
then why listen to this one blather on for 20 minutes ,
why whisk her away to speak privately , hmm ?
why wipe her memory , stefan ?
she knows something .
come on . don &apos;t do this . just let her go .
see ? he &apos;s digging in .
can always spot a liar .
how about a countdown ?
that &apos;s fair for everyone , right ?
5 seconds .
4 ... 3 ...
enzo , let her go , or i swear--
you &apos;ll what ?
i will kill you .
will you ? because stefan &apos;s 5 seconds are up .
no !
don &apos;t be stupid . don &apos;t be stupid .
just think . all of this could have been avoided
if you &apos;d have just told the truth .
no matter . i &apos;ll find out sooner or later .
bonnie &apos;s gonna get to the house ,
and we will be gone .
until the next comet or full moon or eclipse .
as long as we have that , we can go back
as many times as we need until we get her back .
wait . are you guys talking about bonnie bennett ?
because honestly , i didn &apos;t think she was all that great .
no !
i am gonna enjoy the hell out of this .
oh , hey . me , too .
oh , yeah . damon , i , uh , i stole some of liv &apos;s magic
when i tried to kill her .
think some of it might still be in my system ,
so pardon me .
you missed one .
phesmatos incendia .
no !
oh , god .
you ok ?
i guess this is that , uh ,
antimagic border ,
which means now there &apos;s a psycho loose in mystic falls
and no vampires around to stop him .
whoops .
look . i &apos;m sorry that enzo killed her . he &apos;s--
a monster . yeah , i know ,
but you could have stopped him , and you didn &apos;t .
what , you think that was easy for me ,
watching an innocent girl die ?
i don &apos;t know actually .
you &apos;re not exactly the sharing type .
matt , i promise you that everything i do
i have thought out over and over ,
making sure it &apos;s the right thing to do .
so we &apos;re just supposed to trust that you know best ?
no . you &apos;re supposed to trust that i &apos;m nothing like enzo .
the problem is you are
because no matter how close vampires get to humans ,
our lives will always mean less ,
so when push comes to shove , we &apos;ll be on opposite sides ,
which is what tripp knew and i didn &apos;t .
jeremy ?
let me guess . she &apos;s not with you ?
she was on her way , but--
but at the last minute , something went wrong ,
and it didn &apos;t work .
i bet damon &apos;s fine , isn &apos;t he ?
don &apos;t do that .
why not ?
because i think channeling your rage
might be a better option .
how do you feel about being a hunter again ?
why ?
because i want you to help me kill enzo .
so jo drove me across the border .
told her she was crazy ,
that you &apos;d never compel me .
look , ric .
we had to get bonnie back .
getting bonnie back was never off the table .
what was off the table was compelling me to steal from my girlfriend
when we had promised her we &apos;d keep her brother locked way .
yeah , i know .
where is he kai ?
he &apos;s out , but it &apos;s not our fa--
i left bonnie a note at the house .
i told her we would be on your front porch .
she &apos;d probably be there now
with about a half an hour to spare .
she sacrificed everything for us
over and over again ,
and then we were supposed to be there for her .
she &apos;s all alone .
i think gin gets a bad rap .
i &apos;d rather not kill you ,
but i will .
what the hell do you want ?
this is gonna sound crazy ,
but i &apos;m want to save liv &apos;s life .
feel like making a deal with the devil ?
