this is a get @-@ to @-@ know @-@ you thing .
i asked her out on a date to get to know her .
okay ? that &apos;s all , that &apos;s all it is . that &apos;s it .
and i got no argument with any of that .
but you &apos;re a navy seal , right ?
what is the first rule of any op ?
always have an exit strategy .
you go to some deserted island with this woman ,
and you do your snorkeling or whatever , you &apos;re done .
whether you like her or not ,
you &apos;re stuck with her for the whole day .
‭ i mean , whatever happened to just going out for coffee ?
that &apos;s her ?
yeah .
forget what i just said .
i don &apos;t know what the hell i &apos;m talking about .
you should go to that island .
you and her , the two of you , have a good time .
maybe not come back .
you should stay forever ; i would stay forever .
i mean , like , forever @-@ ever .
how &apos;s it going ?
pretty good .
let me take that .
i got to say , you &apos;re ambitious .
why ?
most guys would just go for coffee
or mai tais on a first date , but not you .
well , go big or go home , right ?
i guess so .
you know , i always wanted to snorkel the northwestern islands .
my old man , he used to threaten
to take me out here when i was a kid ,
but , uh , you know , we never made it .
ellie told me about your father .
sounds like a good man .
he was .
he was a very good man .
i &apos;m glad i mentioned doing this .
me , too .
mind if i take the wheel ?
you ever driven one of these before ?
yeah .
i grew up on boats .
my father was a commercial fisherman .
okay , you &apos;re pushing me out of the way .
is that what &apos;s happening ?
move over .
just slide behind you here .
i might learn something now .
all right .
ready ?
yeah , i &apos;m ready .
you say your dad was a commercial fisherman ?
he was ,
but i always said he went too slow .
he didn &apos;t die in a boating accident , did he ?
trust me .
i don &apos;t even know you .
you hear that ?
what ?
absolutely nothing .
told you this place is good for the soul .
when &apos;s the last time you came out here ?
i was 15 .
my grandfather used to take
my brother and i out here every summer .
on the weekends , we got to choose an island ,
and this one was my favorite .
i can see why . it &apos;s beautiful .
crystal @-@ clear water , and the visibility is sick .
it should be great today .
you ready ?
after you .
after me ? no , no , no .
gonna have to play the chivalry card today .
ladies first !
you military guys are way too polite .
oh , no , you &apos;re funny . that was good .
you got me a good one .
how &apos;d you like that ?
you ready ?
that was incredible .
i mean , i haven &apos;t even seen some of these species before .
that &apos;s &apos; cause no one &apos;s coming out here to put them in a tank .
you want to do some exploring ?
yeah .
i want to show you something .
okay .
all right , so you were undergraduate in los angeles , then what ?
came back here , got my psych degree at uh .
got lucky-- they hired me right out of school ...
department of human services .
yeah , ellie said you work with kids .
yeah , adolescents , mainly , trying to keep them out of jail .
i specialize in hard cases .
repeat offenders .
kids the system &apos;s ready to give up on .
but you &apos;re not .
i don &apos;t like to give up on anyone ,
especially kids .
what &apos;s your batting average ?
ask me in ten years .
sounds like challenging work .
it is .
this is it .
what ?
this is amazing .
i told you .
this is incredible .
steve ...
smile .
we &apos;re gonna have to take another one .
why are you gonna have to take another one ?
it kind of looks like you photo bombed a peter lik .
okay , i &apos;m ready . all right .
you want to take a photograph ? cheese .
say cheese .
how &apos;s that ?
i &apos;d say that &apos;s a keeper .
let me see .
that &apos;s a good photo . here , i &apos;ll take one of you .
now , i &apos;m a gentleman .
i &apos;m gonna give you time to get ready ,
do what you need to do .
beautiful . you ready ?
okay , good .
okay , look at that .
‭ what are you laughing at ?
very funny .
fine , i &apos;ll take another one .
you are done taking photos for the day .
you got to be in one photograph .
i will . that &apos;s why god invented the selfie .
‭ - unless , of course , you object ?
i do not .
let me see that .
i can erase it if you don &apos;t like it .
why would you erase it ?
it &apos;s a great photo .
it &apos;s perfect .
okay , you know what ?
we should head back .
wait , i know a shortcut to the beach .
you do ?
see if you can keep up .
lead the way , hotshot .
a spot in the state championship is on the line today .
kukui &apos;s gotten off to a rough start ,
it &apos;ll be up to star quarterback jesse frontera
to get the team back in the game .
ready ! down !
frontera drops back to run the flank .
fakes the hand @-@ off and ...
he &apos;s immediately hit and sacked for an eight @-@ yard loss .
the kukuis &apos; own line can &apos;t keep their qb off his back .
主队7 : 客队0
it &apos;s going to be a long afternoon , folks .
yeah , man , i &apos;m telling you .
i was right there when she drove up .
was she hot ?
she was smoking hot .
guys ?
was she thumb worthy ?
was she what ?
oh , come on , man . don &apos;t tell me
you never heard that expression before .
uh , no .
would you cut off your thumb to spend the weekend with her ?
what ?
guys , i &apos;m right here .
so it &apos;s like a @-@ a scale from one to five .
you got your pinky , which is the least useful .
going all the way down to your thumb ,
which is very important .
okay , let &apos;s just get something straight right now .
first of all , i &apos;m not cutting off none of my digits
for some weekend booty .
but if i would ,
yeah , that girl is definitely thumb worthy .
so she was hot .
my god .
you guys are idiots , you know that , right ?
second and long .
kukui goes three wide receivers .
here we go .
red 14 ! hut !
he snaps the ball .
sets his feet ,
looks left , throws it downfield , and ...
incomplete .
frontera had a man wide open down the middle of the field--
never looked his way .
tough break for the quarterback
&apos;cause everyone has had their eyes on this season .
and this is the kid you tell me
2014年太平洋12校联盟橄榄球总决赛mvp
is the next marcus mariota ?
he hasn &apos;t completed a pass the whole damn game .
you know what ?
he &apos;s off to a rough start , lou .
give him a break .
yeah . it &apos;s the division one semis ,
scouts all over the stands ,
jesse &apos;s just putting too much pressure on himself .
please ! that &apos;s all the more reason to bring your &quot; a &quot; game .
it &apos;s a quick huddle by kukui ,
and they &apos;re back on the line .
and he drops the snap !
if this kid &apos;s day isn &apos;t bad enough ...
cougar ball to 19 @-@ yard line .
first and ten .
in the words of charles barkley ,
&quot; this boy is terrible . &quot;
like he &apos;s giving the damn game away .
frontera storms off the field ,
as this dream season is quickly getting away from kukui high .
lou , i &apos;ve watched this kid play every game this season .
this is just not like him .
something &apos;s not right .
those two birds look like they &apos;re up to something .
could just be going to the bathroom .
yeah ...
except the bathroom &apos;s the other way .
something &apos;s not right .
what &apos;s up ?
we should &apos;ve been there by now .
you don &apos;t recognize this ?
no .
okay .
um , maybe you got turned around or something .
i &apos;m sorry .
it doesn &apos;t matter . you know what ?
we just turn around and come back the way we came .
like i said , it &apos;s been a long time .
what ?
you see that ?
yeah .
what is that ?
it &apos;s a plane .
you all right ?
this thing &apos;s intact .
i mean ... it &apos;s pristine .
there &apos;s no way it crash @-@ landed here .
what &apos;s it doing here ?
move , move !
keep moving .
who is that ?
i don &apos;t know . keep moving .
keep moving . we gotta keep moving .
come on !
let me see your phone .
yeah .
everything &apos;s gonna be okay , all right ?
everything &apos;s gonna be okay .
all right , listen to me .
clearly , this guy &apos;s upset that we found his plane . okay ?
what are we gonna do ?
he could keep shooting at us all day .
no one &apos;s gonna hear .
you &apos;re gonna do two things .
first of all , you &apos;re gonna breathe in for four seconds .
then you &apos;re gonna breathe out for four seconds .
it &apos;s called &quot; combat breathing . &quot;
it helps with the stress .
now do what i &apos;m doing , in ...
okay . what &apos;s the second ?
second thing is , you &apos;re gonna stay calm .
yeah , as soon as he stops shooting , i promise .
you just made a joke . that &apos;s great .
if you &apos;re making jokes , we &apos;re making progress .
no , we are not making progress .
trust me , we are not making progress .
listen to me .
i &apos;m not going to let anything happen to you . okay ?
okay ?
okay .
what &apos;s your plan ?
this guy &apos;s got a gun ; we don &apos;t have a gun , okay ?
so we need to find our boat and get the hell off this island .
that &apos;s my plan .
okay ?
okay .
come on .
that boat was our only way off the island .
i was giving them the benefit of the doubt till now .
yeah .
keep an eye on them , will you ?
yeah . copy that .
jesse .
hey , you okay ?
mr. kelly .
now &apos;s not a good time .
hey , come on , jesse . you know me .
what &apos;s going on ?
i can &apos;t talk to you right now .
yes , you can .
tell us who those two guys were that just walked out of here .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
two goons .
bad clothes .
pretty hard to miss .
listen , kid , quit fooling around
and tell us what the hell &apos;s going on here , and i mean right now .
i can &apos;t !
yes , you can .
and now you don &apos;t have a choice .
because i &apos;m not just here as a friend .
son , you need to understand something .
whatever you do out there on that football field today
is going to affect you for the rest of your life .
he &apos;s right .
you willing to risk everything that you worked so hard for ?
i watched you play every single game .
i know exactly what you &apos;re capable of .
you shattered all of my records by your junior year .
you got scouts crawling all over this place .
you really got a shot at going the distance .
but you know the only thing you showed me today ?
that something is wrong .
if i talk , they &apos;ll kill him .
okay .
tell us who .
tell us what &apos;s happening .
this morning , i got a call from a guy .
he said he had my dad .
that they took him .
okay . did he identify himself ?
no .
but he said if kukui didn &apos;t lose this game ,
my dad would never come home again .
and you &apos;re sure they have your father ?
yeah .
he was dealing a big card game last night
and never came home .
which game ?
bungalow one at the lilikoi hotel .
that &apos;s big stakes texas hold &apos; em .
a lot of high rollers .
any one of them could have money on this game .
and they send these two meatheads in here
to make sure the kid gets the message .
they said i better find a way to get back in the game .
and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;re gonna do ,
except you &apos;re not gonna throw it , all right ?
i &apos;ll talk to the coach and i &apos;ll get you back in there .
what about my dad ?
you just win .
we &apos;ll find him .
you there ?
yeah .
you got any sign of &apos; em ?
no , nothing .
well , they didn &apos;t just swim back to oahu .
so we gotta move .
back to the plane .
there could be a weapon there or a radio
or at least something that tells us
who these people are and gives us an advantage .
okay ?
you want to go back to the plane ?
yeah . it &apos;s the last place these guys are gonna look ,
unless you got a better idea .
sorry , i &apos;m so terrified . i can &apos;t think .
yes , we will go with your logic .
okay , good .
let &apos;s move .
wait .
what ?
i know a better way .
is this you pitching another shortcut ?
&apos;cause the last one didn &apos;t work out so good .
come on .
where &apos;s this shortcut ?
right up there .
but we have to cross directly over the falls .
those falls ?
yeah .
you &apos;ve done that before ?
no .
but my grandfather said he did .
he said he did ?
was he the type to , maybe , exaggerate a story ?
i don &apos;t know .
he did say he caught a thousand @-@ pound bluefin tuna once .
i &apos;m just kidding .
no , he ...
he did cross the falls .
i think . i don &apos;t know . it doesn &apos;t matter .
we have to do it , right ?
right .
okay .
this seat taken ?
kukui calls a time out .
they &apos;re trying anything to slow down the kaiser dolphins .
popcorn .
i tell you . boy , i love popcorn .
problem is , i &apos;m gettin &apos; old .
i can &apos;t digest it like i used to , you know ?
but they say they &apos;re making them little kernels now ,
so they go down easier .
walk away , big man .
let me tell you how this is gonna go .
&apos;cause i can tell you two birds
are thinking about going for those guns in your waistband .
that &apos;s a bad move .
see , then i gotta put a couple of holes in the both of you
in front of all these nice people .
let &apos;s just say one of you gets the drop on me .
well , you see that girl up there ?
go ahead , take a look .
mm @-@ hmm . yeah , her .
she &apos;s an excellent shot .
do you know that little girl
can hit a pimple on an elephant &apos;s ass from 100 yards away ?
oh , yeah .
so here &apos;s the smart play .
i &apos;m gonna take your guns ...
relax , it &apos;s gonna be fine .
come on .
we &apos;re gonna get up .
we &apos;re gonna take a little walk
and then we &apos;re gonna have a nice conversation somewhere ,
like gentlemen .
you know , i completely misjudged you .
you &apos;re nowhere near as dumb as you look .
you okay ?
i &apos;m fine . keep going .
see , it &apos;s not that bad , right ?
well , it &apos;s not great , but ...
i know .
i &apos;m sorry , but it &apos;s gonna save us a lot of time .
steve !
i &apos;m okay . i &apos;m good .
good work .
piece of cake .
what &apos;s next ?
through there , it &apos;s just another half mile to the plane .
get down !
what are you doing here ?
you stand down and i &apos;ll tell you .
lynn !
you &apos;re bleeding .
yeah , no , i &apos;m okay .
who is that guy ?
i don &apos;t know .
i think he did jail time , though .
you see that tattoo on his neck ?
that cross ?
it looks like something from the inside .
all right .
let me see it .
just ...
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry , but we got to keep pressure on it , okay ?
he &apos;s got to be dead , right ?
let &apos;s not celebrate just yet .
he &apos;s only half our problem .
his partner &apos;s still out there .
keep a lookout .
cuffs ?
yeah , cuffs .
and leg shackles and a belly chain .
this plane was a prisoner transport .
so , the people who are after us are escaped criminals .
well , there &apos;s only one set .
so i &apos;m thinking the guy we sent over the falls .
he was the cargo .
only he didn &apos;t escape .
these things weren &apos;t opened forcefully .
he either had the key
or the people who were guarding him let him go .
excuse me .
all right .
gonna fly us out of here , are you ?
not today .
good , because that would be way too impressive for a first date .
okay , this thing departed from manila 9th of january , 2011 .
they had 20,000 pounds of fuel .
eta was 19 : 00 hours .
lgb-- that &apos;s long beach , california .
oh , that makes sense .
there &apos;s a state penitentiary there-- terminal island .
manila 2011 ...
four years ago ,
uh , a fugitive boston mob boss by the name
of @-@ of dennis logan , he was picked up in the philippines .
i remember that guy .
he was always on tv wearing the fancy suits .
that &apos;s right , same guy .
fbi picked him up in the philippines .
then they were transporting him to prison ,
and presumably the plane went down north of the hawaiian islands .
all right , this transponder right here ?
it &apos;s been turned off manually ,
which means the atc could never have tracked this plane .
to the outside world , it looked like this plane crashed .
yeah , but wouldn &apos;t the fbi still come looking for them ?
well , yeah , sure , but they hid the plane .
i mean , we barely saw it and we were standing right next to it .
what about the pilot ,
all the other people in the plane ?
i don &apos;t see any signs of a struggle .
so i &apos;m thinking they must &apos;ve been in on it .
logan had money , he had lots and lots of money .
he must &apos;ve paid them to disappear .
go and see if you can find anything useful on board .
i &apos;m gonna look in the storage bay .
steve ?
this looks like something .
excellent . that &apos;s an elt .
what ?
uh , it &apos;s an emergency locator transmitter .
it sends out a signal ,
a satellite grabs it ,
forwards the data to @-@ to rescue authorities .
i like the sound of that .
yeah , if this thing works ,
phones are gonna start ringing
in relay stations all across the country .
that &apos;s a good sign .
that &apos;s not good .
that sucks .
okay .
logan and his partner-- they had radios , right ?
which means they got access to a power source .
if we can get to that power source ,
we can get this elt working .
jesse &apos;s dad-- where is he ?
never seen him before .
look , nobody &apos;s dead yet .
nobody &apos;s even hurt .
you can still walk away from this a free man .
we just need to know where jesse &apos;s father is .
i think i &apos;ll stop talking now .
fine .
our turn .
your name is sean roberts .
street knows you as giraffe .
you did a four @-@ year stint in folsom for armed robbery ,
18 months in chino for assault .
extortion and kidnapping are a big step up for you .
let &apos;s not forget about carrying a piece in public .
so , with the right judge ,
you &apos;re looking at about ... ten years plus .
it &apos;s got you thinking , right ?
look , with a little help here ,
you could walk instead of doing time .
where is kai frontera ?
kai who ?
look , chin , these guys are pros .
they got encrypted phones .
the crime lab &apos;s trying to break them now .
all right , well , the clock is ticking .
there &apos;s probably not enough time to pull all the data as it is .
let &apos;s get the other one in here .
lynn , stop , wait .
you &apos;re bleeding again .
we got to keep moving .
no , wait , wait , wait . let me see that .
it &apos;s fine , you got more of that shirt ?
just make me a new bandage .
just let me see it .
okay , this thing needs more than another bandage .
okay , i &apos;m gonna clean the wound with this .
with coconut water ?
yeah , coconut water .
don &apos;t knock it .
you know , in world war ii ,
they used coconut water in the i.v. solutions
when they ran out of glucose .
did you know that ?
all right .
all right .
thank you .
you are very welcome .
steve , did you hear that ?
we got to move .
look who &apos;s back from the dead .
where are they ?
i don &apos;t know .
we better find them ! now !
we need to get that boat .
okay , i like where this is going .
how do you suggest we do that ?
you &apos;re gonna steal it .
i already told you guys i don &apos;t know no kai .
and we &apos;d believe you .
well , that is if you weren &apos;t such a world @-@ class scumbag .
excuse me ?
what are you deaf , scumbag ?
you even know who you &apos;re talking to ?
i know exactly what i &apos;m talking to , diaz .
a violent predicate felon working on his second strike .
and you know what ?
for a scumbag like yourself ,
a kidnap charge is gonna mean 25 to life .
if that kidnapping gets bumped up to murder--
well , then you &apos;re just done .
then a great day for you is gonna mean extra jell @-@ o .
it &apos;s got to be halftime .
last chance , armando .
or what ?
what are you gonna do to me ?
let me give you some friendly advice .
make sure kukui loses that game .
you &apos;re a cop , man !
you can &apos;t do this !
oh , you &apos;re absolutely right-- i can &apos;t .
and you can &apos;t kidnap a guy
and force his son to throw a football game .
so maybe neither you or i
are the best judges of what &apos;s right
and what &apos;s wrong !
oh , you son of a bitch .
you broke my jaw .
i hope to hell i did , because you know what ?
otherwise it would mean that your blood is all over me for nothing !
take it easy !
we don &apos;t do that .
you &apos;re lucky he &apos;s here .
oh , relax . i &apos;m not gonna hit you .
i &apos;m not gonna hit you .
i &apos;m just an old man .
now maybe i should give you
a little friendly advice , hmm ?
you need to tell us who you &apos;re working for .
no ?
i &apos;m not a gambling man like yourself .
um , i usually only bet on sure things .
like he &apos;s gonna keep right on hitting you .
i &apos;ll tell you what though-- just , just , just for fun .
let &apos;s see how much i got-- one , i got two ,
i got , i got 300 .
i can &apos;t bet anymore . i got a wife .
i got $ 300 that says
you &apos;re gonna tell us where jesse &apos;s father is
and then the kid &apos;s gonna go out ,
and he &apos;s gonna win his football game .
and then your boss is going to either jail ,
the hospital or the morgue today .
you know what ? i dare you to take that bet .
three hundred .
i didn &apos;t think so .
all right , it looks like the coach just put jesse back in the game .
he just connected on a 40 @-@ yard pass .
so kukui &apos;s down ten
with a little bit more than 14 minutes left to play .
ah , damn . gutsy kid .
let &apos;s hope he &apos;s got the focus to finish the game .
finally , okay , dea just downloaded
the information on our kidnapper .
his name is oliver zelenko .
he had an import / export business out of los angeles
that was just recently shut down .
the feds think that it was a ...
it was a front for running heroin from turkey .
looks like he &apos;s also a degenerate gambler .
he had a big house in ka &apos;a&apos;awa ,
and now it &apos;s under foreclosure .
i &apos;m guessing he put down a big bet against kukui
to get himself healthy again .
yeah . hey , how much further ?
30 miles .
shoot-- 30 miles .
we got some timeouts and delays , but ...
i don &apos;t think we gonna make it .
we &apos;ll make it .
kona , please tell me you &apos;re there .
we &apos;re here .
good .
what about you ?
we broke one of the guys--
literally .
he said that they &apos;re holding jesse &apos;s father in ka &apos;a&apos;awa .
we &apos;re halfway there .
kid looks kind of shaky .
what do i tell him ?
nothing .
keep your men positioned all around the field .
if anyone so much as looks at jesse the wrong way ,
take him down .
copy that .
so what &apos;s the plan ?
nothing changes .
we find him , we kill him ...
get the hell off the island .
and go where ?
can &apos;t stay here , vick-- we &apos;ve been compromised .
lookit , there are hundreds of these little islands in the chain .
no one &apos;s ever gonna find us .
that &apos;s what you said about this place .
over there !
there he is .
hey , hey , hey . where &apos;s the girl ?
you stay on him .
you know something ?
it almost worked .
hey , mcgarrett !
i got your girl !
you show yourself ...
or i will kill her !
steve !
you don &apos;t think i &apos;ll do it ?
let her go .
i said let her go .
all right , you &apos;ve had a good run ; now it &apos;s over .
you are in no position to give orders .
i &apos;m sorry , dennis .
you hear that , pal , huh ?
i &apos;m taking vickie back to oahu with me .
i don &apos;t believe you .
there &apos;s no way you &apos;re gonna go ...
and leave your girlfriend behind .
i just met her . what do i care ?
keep moving .
you better pray to god he didn &apos;t take my boat .
if he took your girlfriend ,
he definitely took your boat .
move faster !
move ! now ! go on ! go !
move ! move !
where is he ? where the hell is he ?
don &apos;t move .
drop it right now .
drop the gun , get on your knees .
on your knees .
hands behind your head .
interlock your fingers .
lynn ...
if he moves , you shoot him , all right ?
my pleasure .
you know , i was saying you look good
for somebody who died in a plane crash
four years ago .
i got money . i could pay you .
yeah , like you paid the feds off who were supposed
to take you to prison the first time , is that right ?
get up .
everybody &apos;s got a price , mcgarrett .
what &apos;s yours ?
this is it .
let &apos;s go .
first down and goal ,
kukui looking to tie this game up .
as jesse frontera has led his team to an unbelievable comeback .
frontera goes back .
he keeps the ball , takes off running ,
over two defen ... and touchdown , frontera !
can you believe what we are seeing ?
kukui lines up for the extra point .
kukui snaps the ball.the extra point is up and good !
we &apos;re all tied at 20 with a minute and half to play .
an improbable comeback by kukui .
you guys there yet ?
we got five miles left .
