第三集
we are in a land without magic ,
but i &apos;m bringing it .
magic-- it &apos;s different here .
i &apos;m not losing her again !
where &apos;s my mom ?
they fell through a portal .
i will find them .
i will always find them .
emma , run !
take them to the pit .
can you hear me ?
do you need help ?
who are you ?
my name &apos;s cora .
who are they ?
king george .
bring me his head !
king george &apos;s men are here on this ridge .
we have to move camp . they &apos;re coming for us .
no ! we will not run .
we said we were gonna take the kingdom back ,
and we can &apos;t do that with our tails between our legs .
no offense .
but matters have worsened .
the king has a new general .
who is he ?
they call him the leviathan .
they say he attacks like a monster
striking from the depths of the sea .
you never see him coming
and you never survive .
we &apos;ll see about that .
how close is his army ?
i &apos;d say pretty close .
we should split up , divide them .
exactly . go . go .
look .
aren &apos;t you coming ?
he &apos;s after me .
you &apos;ll have a better chance of escaping on your own .
don &apos;t worry . meet me in two days &apos; time at the cabin .
the cabin ? where she is ?
are you sure ?
we &apos;re engaged .
i think it &apos;s about time you met my mother .
go . go .
what kind of general hides behind a mask ?
who are you really , leviathan ?
leviathan ?
that &apos;s what they &apos;re calling me ?
name &apos;s lancelot .
lancelot .
of the round table ?
not anymore .
you sure she &apos;s gonna be okay ?
don &apos;t worry . she &apos;ll be fine .
what is this place ? where are we ?
it &apos;s a little island our captors like
to think of as their haven .
haven ? from what ?
the world &apos;s dangerous .
what &apos;s left of it , anyway ,
well , they can &apos;t keep us down here .
we didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
neither did i.
then why are you here ?
i &apos;m here because of something ...
my daughter did .
the curse that ravaged this land--
she cast it .
regina . you &apos;re regina &apos;s mother ?
yes . but you &apos;ve nothing to fear from me .
the apple fell very far from the tree .
you &apos;re from over there , aren &apos;t you ?
how &apos;d you get back ?
emma .
no .
oh , snow . you &apos;re awake . i &apos;m so relieved .
as bad as you think regina is ,
this woman is worse .
oh , snow .
sweet snow , please .
believe me ,
whatever she told you
isn &apos;t true .
i just want to help you .
let &apos;s hear her out .
emma .
okay , right now we are at the bottom of a hole
with no other options ,
and henry is back in storybrooke with regina .
who &apos;s henry ?
my son .
i kind of share him with regina .
it &apos;s complicated .
don &apos;t talk to her .
enough !
our leader requests an audience .
so what &apos;s on the agenda for operation scorpion ?
what &apos;s operation scorpion ?
the code name for our mission to find emma and snow .
do you prefer viper ?
that was my second choice .
henry , we need to talk .
yeah , scorpion &apos;s better .
no , it &apos;s not that .
it &apos;s ...
i &apos;m not coming with you .
but i @-@ i thought we were gonna find jefferson .
i already did .
what ? is he gonna help us ?
no . no , henry , he &apos;s not .
but why didn &apos;t you tell me you talked to him ?
because i didn &apos;t want to disappoint you .
i know you want to find your mom ,
but jefferson can &apos;t help us .
i need to find a way to restore the hat .
so why can &apos;t i help you look ?
it &apos;ll require magic , henry , and magic--
always comes with a price .
i read the book , you know .
i &apos;m sorry , but i just can &apos;t let you anywhere near this stuff .
if you really want to help me ,
you &apos;ll go to school ,
where i know you &apos;ll be safe . okay ?
okay .
why can &apos;t you just listen to me ?
why couldn &apos;t you have trusted me ?
i was just trying to find a way to get us home .
i could &apos;ve handled her .
cora ? don &apos;t be so sure .
i &apos;ve lived here , emma .
i know this world and its dangers .
wait here .
is that why you came through the portal ?
because you thought i was helpless here ?
no .
i came through to be with you .
lancelot ?
snow .
if i &apos;d have known that you were the prisoners
mulan had brought back ,
i never would &apos;ve locked you away .
please forgive me .
of course .
lancelot ? really ?
he &apos;s an old friend .
we can trust him .
this is emma .
why is he embracing them ?
they were responsible for phillip &apos;s death .
you &apos;re new here , aurora .
phillip trusted lancelot . so must we .
i want justice .
tread carefully .
it &apos;s dangerous to confuse vengeance with justice .
do you understand me ?
do you understand me ?
yes .
what the hell is that ?
that is chimera .
an acquired taste , but all our hunting party could bring back .
one part lion , one part serpent ,
one part goat .
like turducken ?
i don &apos;t understand .
we were told this land didn &apos;t even exist anymore .
how did you all escape the curse ?
it is a mystery .
the curse struck , and when the smoke cleared ,
most of us had been torn from this land .
but some of us here , in this particular region ,
were left behind .
we don &apos;t know how and we don &apos;t know why .
finding this safe haven wasn &apos;t easy .
it took some spilt blood .
but worry not .
you &apos;re safe here .
we can &apos;t stay .
my husband &apos;s back there , emma &apos;s son ,
my grandson-- we have to get back to them .
can you help us find a portal ?
leaving is unwise .
the enchanted forest is not as you remember it .
the ogres have returned .
ogres ?
like as in fee @-@ fi @-@ fo @-@ fum ?
those would be giants .
ogres are far worse .
that &apos;s why we live here ,
on this island , where it &apos;s safe .
please , snow .
stay here . there are no more portals left .
i might know of one .
you do ?
where ?
cora &apos;s near .
i don &apos;t feel comfortable voicing my plans .
she &apos;s powerful .
not anymore .
the curse stripped her of her powers .
but given her reputation ,
we &apos;ve kept her locked up as a precaution .
nevertheless , i &apos;m not taking chances .
just trust me . i may have a way .
let us go .
i &apos;ll allow it ,
but on one condition ...
take my bravest warrior with you .
allow mulan to defend you .
we can defend ourselves .
deal .
thank you , lancelot ,
for always looking out for me .
i don &apos;t care what you do to me .
i will never tell you where he is !
i know . that &apos;s not why you &apos;re here .
would you bring our guest some water ?
times have been good for you , haven &apos;t they ?
i can see a light in your eyes .
cherish that ,
because that light can die
and be replaced by something else ...
pain .
the only thing you know of pain is how to inflict it .
that &apos;s where you &apos;re so very , very wrong .
i &apos;ve had my share of pain .
i had a son that i loved die before his time .
i tried to replace him with your &quot; charming , &quot;
offered him the world ,
but he rejected me ,
humiliated me in front of my kingdom ,
all for the sake of true love .
something about which you know nothing .
i know more than you think .
you ...
were in love ?
yes ,
and she loved me .
we were happy , blissful ,
but then she became cursed .
she drank a vile potion that made it impossible
for us to conceive a child .
family is everything , my dear .
losing all hope of having one--
there is no greater misery .
charming could &apos;ve been that hope for me ,
but instead , he made my suffering worse .
for that , death is too good for him .
first , he must know pain-- my pain .
no .
you poisoned her ?
i cursed her .
she will never bear a child .
choose wisely .
we must be vigilant if we hope to survive the journey .
where &apos;s my gun ?
i want it back .
is it magic ?
depends on who &apos;s pulling the trigger .
follow my lead , step where i step ,
do exactly as i say , and we might survive .
thanks for the pep talk , but i think we &apos;re okay .
i just killed a dragon last week .
have you ever seen an ogre ?
pretty sure i &apos;ve dated a few .
legend has it that when they kill you ,
the last thing you see is yourself dying
in the reflection in their eyes .
let &apos;s walk .
it &apos;ll be dark soon .
don &apos;t let her rattle you .
i won &apos;t let anything happen to us .
stick to the plan .
what is the plan ? you haven &apos;t told me anything .
what &apos;s going on ?
the wardrobe .
wardrobe ?
the wardrobe ?
like , the wardrobe that sent little baby me to maine ?
you think it could get us back to storybrooke ?
i don &apos;t know .
first we have to see if it survived the curse ,
then we &apos;ll worry about making it work .
where is it ?
my place .
you wanna see where you &apos;re from , emma ?
that &apos;s right .
we &apos;re going home .
jefferson .
right ?
the mad hatter .
i need your help .
look , i already told your grandfather--
i can &apos;t do anything .
i know , but there must be something we can do .
i &apos;m the wrong person to talk to , kid .
magic &apos;s not my thing . try your mother .
maybe she &apos;s got something in that vault of hers
she can help you with .
vault ?
her vault is here ? in storybrooke ?
it &apos;s none of my business . talk to her .
what &apos;s that ?
your daughter &apos;s looking for you , isn &apos;t she ?
what do you know about it ?
i &apos;ve read your story .
i know how the two of you were separated .
why are you here ?
she &apos;s at school .
i gotta go home , kid .
she probably wants to see you .
get out of my way .
why aren &apos;t you going to find her ?
get out of my way .
because i left her !
and she &apos;ll hate me .
how do you know that ?
i was on my way ,
but fate reminded me i shouldn &apos;t .
you should .
i &apos;ve been left , too .
anything &apos;s better than nothing .
she &apos;ll spend her whole life wondering why you left her .
not knowing is the worst .
henry .
i &apos;m just packing up the office .
i &apos;ve been asked to leave .
no , of course it can wait .
i &apos;d love to have lunch with you .
granny &apos;s , ten minutes .
this will do .
we &apos;ll make camp here for the night .
we just need to find water , collect some firewood .
uh , if we &apos;re hiding from ogres ,
shouldn &apos;t we maybe , i don &apos;t know , not start a fire ?
ogres are blind . they hunt by sound alone .
right . because that &apos;s something everyone would know about ogres .
look ...
i know you &apos;re out of your element ...
i &apos;m fine .
i know , but maybe you should just stay here
while we get wood and water , guard the campsite .
you mean the big , empty clearing ?
it &apos;s the safest place . we &apos;ll be right back .
wait ! i &apos;ve come to help .
after what you did to me ?
after what the king did to you .
i still do have a small shred of honor left .
do you really think i &apos;m that naive ?
you &apos;re going to earn my trust so i can lead you straight--
to the cabin where your prince is hiding his mother ?
how did you know ?
because george knows where it is .
he sent men there to kill your man &apos;s mother .
charming &apos;s at the cabin , too .
mother , the place looks beautiful .
will you come inside ?
i &apos;m sorry if i want things to be perfect
when i meet the girl ...
my son is going to marry .
wait .
did you hear that ?
go in . bolt the door .
whatever happens , stay inside . go .
what ?
that &apos;s it ?
son ?
mother !
mother !
i told you to stay inside .
i know , but i heard you .
i thought you were hurt .
i &apos;m sorry .
no . you &apos;re gonna be okay .
okay ? everything &apos;s gonna be okay .
i &apos;m so sorry .
we came as quickly as we could .
is this ...
snow ?
don &apos;t move .
phillip &apos;s gone because of you .
you listen to me , princess !
you think i don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like
to be separated from the people that i love ?
what happened to phillip was not our fault .
so i suggest you find another way to channel your anger .
don &apos;t talk to her like that .
she tried to kill me .
i will deal with her .
emma , what are you doing ?
protecting you . drop the weapon !
do you have any idea what you &apos;ve just done ?
ogres ?
run !
aurora . this way .
come on !
split up !
come on !
over there .
seriously ?
back away from my daughter !
you have to shoot them in the eye .
when was the last time you shot an arrow ?
28 years ago .
guess it &apos;s like riding a bike .
yeah , but how did you know you could hit that ?
i didn &apos;t .
next time , listen to me .
that kind of thing isn &apos;t gonna work here .
yeah .
we should get going .
it &apos;s poisoned .
can we find an antidote ?
or the fairies . they can help us .
no . i &apos;m afraid this is gonna take
something stronger than fairy dust .
lake nostos-- i &apos;ve been there before .
its waters have powerful magical properties .
i &apos;ve seen them turn a man from solid gold back into flesh .
it isn &apos;t far . a day &apos;s journey at most .
i &apos;ll prepare a wagon .
must be a curious tale .
what ?
well , how a knight of the round table ended up a sword for hire .
you mean how did i fall from grace ?
the same way you ended up running from king george .
a woman .
we &apos;re gonna scout ahead . we won &apos;t be long .
thank you .
oh . it &apos;s the least i can do . are you comfortable ?
no .
for giving my son something to believe in .
all he &apos;s ever dreamt of was having a wife
and a son .
fret not .
it could be a daughter . but trust me ,
all that matters is that it &apos;s healthy .
let me show you something .
my mother gave this to me
when i was pregnant .
she said it was spelled by a gypsy
to predict the sex of your firstborn
even before you are with child .
and it works ?
it did with my boys .
if it swings north to south ,
it &apos;s a boy .
east to west , it &apos;s a girl .
shall we ?
just between us ?
oh , i don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea .
indulge an old woman .
it &apos;ll help take my mind off the ...
well , you know .
here .
don &apos;t worry . it &apos;s just ...
a silly superstition .
what &apos;s wrong , child ?
you can tell me anything , snow .
it &apos;s the king .
when he captured me , he cursed me ,
so ...
so that i can never have children .
worry not .
if the water from lake nostos can heal me ,
it should be able to do the same for you .
do you really think so ?
you are going to be a wonderful mother .
we &apos;re getting close .
aurora , you &apos;ve gotta keep up .
sorry , but i &apos;m not exactly dressed for the woods .
it &apos;s cold out here .
then maybe you should &apos;ve listened to me and stayed back .
here .
but i tried to kill your friend .
actually , she &apos;s my mom .
i have a feeling she can take care of herself .
and i get it .
you &apos;re not the only one who &apos;s been screwing up lately .
what kind of corset is this ?
up here !
is that it ?
yeah .
that &apos;s our home .
where &apos;s the lake ?
we &apos;re looking at it .
it &apos;s gone .
maybe we should &apos;ve gone with operation viper .
you all right ?
yeah .
how &apos;d you know i was down here ?
your mom said you asked her to lunch ,
and when you stood her up , she checked her office ,
saw her keys missing , figured out the rest .
she would &apos;ve come herself ,
but she didn &apos;t think you &apos;d go with her .
henry , what were you thinking ?
i just want them back .
it wasn &apos;t supposed to be this way .
i should be over there with them ,
riding horses , learning how to swordfight .
i know . i know .
it &apos;s okay ,
because we are gonna do this together .
come on now .
you gotta get to school ...
and i gotta make sure no one else finds this place .
this is my fault .
the siren who lived here-- i killed her .
that &apos;s why the lake is dry .
you needn &apos;t worry . my mother raised me by a lake .
there may yet be water .
you just ... need to know where to look .
god in his mercy ,
lend her grace .
you found it ?
it &apos;s all that &apos;s left .
just enough for one sip .
enough to heal my mother .
we shall find out .
i want you to have it . that last sip of water--
i want you to drink it .
no . no , i couldn &apos;t .
that water can lift your curse ,
allow you and my son
to have a child .
but you &apos;ll die .
i won &apos;t let you give your life for this .
that &apos;s what parents do .
they put their children first .
someday you will understand .
no .
maybe it &apos;s for the best .
i was raised without a mother .
i wouldn &apos;t even know how to be one .
this water was meant for you .
mother .
mother .
our prayers are answered .
there is magic in this lake yet . here . drink .
have faith , snow .
we &apos;ll find another way .
oh , my god .
i recognize this from henry &apos;s book .
come .
we &apos;ll stand watch at the gate .
i never thought i &apos;d see this place again .
this room .
it was your nursery .
i lived here ?
you never even got to spend a night .
this is the life i wanted you to have .
i was going to teach you how to walk in here ,
how to talk ,
how to dress for your first ball .
you never got to do any of it .
we never got to be a family .
we have a family-- in storybrooke .
and right now they need us to get back there .
so ...
how do we get this to work ?
why isn &apos;t it working ?
wounds take time to heal .
no . no .
i used this magic before . it worked instantly .
there wasn &apos;t enough water . we need more .
son ...
stop .
there &apos;s no m @-@ more magic here ,
and i don &apos;t want to spend my last moments this way .
this is all my fault .
i am so sorry .
f @-@ for what ?
for being happy ?
for finding your true love ?
for your happiness ,
i would gladly give my life .
my only regret is that
i won &apos;t live to see you marry snow .
yes , you will .
lancelot ,
does a disgraced member of the round table
still have the power to perform a wedding ?
it would be my honor .
in my kingdom ,
there is legend of a cup
that has the power to grant eternal life .
and so may the love between you always be strong ,
true , and eternal .
good @-@ bye , mother .
where &apos;s the &quot; on &quot; switch ?
it &apos;s more complicated than that .
we &apos;ll have to get it back to the island .
hopefully , someone there has access to enough magic
to make it work again .
how are we gonna carry this thing ?
with the help of an old friend .
lancelot .
what are you doing here ?
we heard about the ogre attack ,
and i had to make sure you were all right .
oh . where are mulan and aurora ?
i sent them to find food . tonight we &apos;ll make camp ,
and in the morning , we &apos;ll head back .
so ... this is it--
the portal you were after .
the same one emma went through .
it &apos;s how she escaped the curse .
remarkable .
geppetto carved it from an enchanted tree , but ...
there &apos;s no magic left .
a portal this powerful ...
there must be another way to recharge it .
why are you so interested in the wardrobe ?
well , i just want you to get home to your husband
and son .
henry .
they must miss you .
stay away from him , emma .
he is not who he says he is .
what are you talking about ? who the hell is he ?
there is only one person you told henry &apos;s name .
cora .
clever girl .
where &apos;s lancelot ?
he &apos;s dead . i killed him a long time ago .
and you &apos;ve been posing as him ever since .
well , they &apos;d never listen to me .
and besides , every kingdom needs a hero , don &apos;t you think ?
thank you , snow .
i &apos;ve been looking for a way over for so long .
i never thought the person to help me find it ...
would be you .
why ?
why are you doing this ?
i want to see my daughter .
it &apos;s been too long .
and you know , i would love to meet my grandson henry .
no , you won &apos;t !
no !
mulan !
we &apos;re not done .
you okay ?
you saved me .
yeah , well ... where is she ?
gone .
so &apos;s our ride home .
i &apos;m so sorry .
she was all the family you had left .
no .
i still have you .
i love you , snow .
and together , we can start a new family .
here . this belonged to her .
she would &apos;ve wanted you to have it .
she said that it could tell you what your child would be .
please don &apos;t .
it &apos;s just a superstition .
there &apos;s something i need to tell you .
what is it ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
we &apos;re going to have a child .
what ?
we &apos;re going to have a child .
is there something i need to know ?
i mean someday .
well , of course we are .
what &apos;s it say it &apos;s gonna be ?
it &apos;s gonna be a boy , right ?
i can never remember which direction means what .
it &apos;s a surprise .
i &apos;ll send the signal for the army to regroup .
we are gonna take back the kingdom , snow ,
and we are going to do it as a family .
this is because of you , isn &apos;t it ?
ruth only pretended to drink the water .
she had you put it in the wedding chalice
so i would drink it .
that &apos;s how king george &apos;s curse was broken , wasn &apos;t it ?
i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
so ...
what &apos;s your child gonna be ?
a girl .
lancelot was one of the most noble knights i ever knew .
how could i be so blind ?
how could i not see that it was cora ?
well , to be fair ,
the whole shape @-@ shifting thing threw me , too .
what are we going to tell the people on the island ?
the truth--that lancelot was cut down by a terrible villain .
he died an honorable death .
cora &apos;s still out there . we need to find her .
we need to defend what &apos;s left of the kingdom .
who &apos;s going to lead us ? you ?
no .
her .
i &apos;m honored ,
but emma and i still have to find a way back to storybrooke .
we &apos;ll help you .
we &apos;ll find a way , won &apos;t we ?
yes .
perhaps it &apos;ll help me channel my anger .
come .
i &apos;m , uh ...
sorry i torched our ride home .
i couldn &apos;t let her get to henry .
i just--
you had to put henry first .
i was angry for so long ...
wondering how you could choose
to let me grow up without you .
but then just seeing all this ...
you gave up everything for me
and you &apos;re still doing that .
sorry . i &apos;m not good at this . i ...
i guess i just ...
i &apos;m not used to someone putting me first .
well , get used to it .
grace .
papa !
you found me . i knew you would .
i &apos;ve been thinking ,
if you &apos;re gonna start helping me ,
we gotta make sure we do this right .
so i picked these up
on my way home .
seriously ?
yeah , you &apos;re the grandson of a prince .
i think it &apos;s about time you learned how to use a sword .
henry , i can &apos;t get &apos; em back without you .
so ?
what do you say ? you with me ?
can you teach me how to fight a dragon ?
we &apos;ll work our way up to it .
my liege .
en garde .
hey . come over here .
up top .
