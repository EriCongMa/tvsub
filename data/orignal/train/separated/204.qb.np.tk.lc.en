gossip gril here ,
you &apos;re one of the resources
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
you two used to be in love .
together , you were invincible .
but now that you &apos;ve turned against each other ,
it &apos;s just a matter of time before your mutual destruction .
truce ?
now i &apos;m in with serena ,
and i can find something even bigger to take her down with .
ben &apos;s not my boyfriend .
please , you &apos;re different than anyone i &apos;ve even known .
just save it , okay ?
&apos;cause you &apos;re exactly like everyone i &apos;ve ever known .
all good things are worth waiting for , aren &apos;t they ?
our new psychology of business professor
is colin , the guy from last night .
cab guy ? what are the odds ?
relationships with faculty are strictly forbidden .
i &apos;m willing to wait if you are .
well , then , teacher , i &apos;ll see you monday .
rise and shine , upper east siders .
it &apos;s officially fall .
and when the leaves start to turn ,
we know it &apos;s time for b. &apos; s birthday .
we hope serena will be there to celebrate ,
but we hear she &apos;s having
her own private party with a professor .
so you &apos;re from maine ?
i grew up on a boat .
not a yacht . a trawler .
my family &apos;s in lobsters .
i love &quot; the deadliest catch . &quot;
okay , so how did you get from there to here ?
yeah , it was all my dad .
he never graduated high school ,
so he made sure i didn &apos;t make the same mistake .
and the rest of your family ?
still adrift , in more ways than one .
do i sense a little mystery there ?
so you came from nothing and now here you are--
this big finance guy
traveling the world with a killer art collection .
favorite book ?
&quot; mergers , acquisitions , and corporate restructurings . &quot;
really ?
you just became my next project .
tomorrow , we &apos;ll have
a music and most embarrassing moments .
unless ...
we can do this , serena .
six more weeks .
i &apos;ll see you tomorrow .
happy to have you home , miss eleanor .
you didn &apos;t think i would miss throwing my only child
a 20th birthday party ?
mother , you do know that
my actual birthday isn &apos;t until next week , don &apos;t you ?
23 hours of labor .
i am not likely to forget .
cyrus and i have tickets to the palais garnier .
so i thought , better an
early birthday bash than a belated one .
it is a shame that the party
will fall on the same night as lily and rufus &apos; anniversary ,
but so goes event planning in manhattan .
cyrus sent you this present .
a signed copy of &quot; this i remember . &quot;
what a fitting gift .
it is time that i claim my rightful role
as power player on the world stage ,
just like little nell did .
tonight &apos;s party is going to be as glamorous and sophisticated
as its guest of honor .
dorota , come .
we have just enough time for a dramatic reading of page one
before i have to meet serena .
so you seem pretty eager to get together this morning .
what ? your--your first
anniversary &apos;s a big deal .
and i @-@ i figured maybe you could use my help planning ,
and maybe i needed to get out of the house .
vanessa just got back from the commune .
you guys talk ?
oh , if saying &quot; hey &quot; and &quot; excuse me &quot;
counts as talking .
worst thing is , she--she tried to
get back into campus housing ,
but , uh , the deadline past .
oh , so now you &apos;re roomies with your ex .
yeah . hey , how would you and lily feel about celebrating ,
with a--with a nice family road trip ?
actually , uh , we decided to order in tonight
and just have a quiet evening alone .
oh , i @-@ i thought you said , um ,
it &apos;s really important to celebrate with the whole family .
we did , but jenny has a big test she has to study for
and can &apos;t make it back to the city .
and it doesn &apos;t feel right
having a family celebration without her .
i know the first wedding anniversary &apos;s
supposed to be paper , but that &apos;s not really an excuse
to--to eat out of cartons .
we &apos;ll celebrate together some other time
when jenny &apos;s back home . i &apos;m gonna head off ,
find lily some flowers , try to make this special .
what class has a test on a saturday ?
that would be fear of chuck and blair one on one .
and after the year we &apos;ve had ,
i think it would mean a lot to my dad and lily
to get the family together . there &apos;s--there &apos;s gotta be a way
that we can get jenny to come in , right ?
maybe chuck could help .
right , like he did last time ?
he loves my mom , and as long as chuck and blair are at war ,
he &apos;s on our side .
did you get a haircut ? it looks different .
no , just happy , i guess .
well , if i know you ,
there &apos;s a guy at the end of that story .
well , i might be seeing someone ... kind of .
what is he doing here ?
what &apos;s she doing here ?
and who brought the avon lady ?
she &apos;s a court stenographer .
there &apos;s a notary on the way .
we &apos;ve witnessed the waldorf / bass wars firsthand .
we know you both . you have nuclear capability .
sooner or later , one of you is gonna press the other &apos;s button ,
and we &apos;re gonna end up with nothing but cockroaches .
you know , we &apos;re way ahead of you .
yeah , we &apos;re in a truce .
which is why we figured you wouldn &apos;t have a problem
making it official--
a peace treaty based on more than just a handshake .
so that &apos;s why we &apos;re gonna sit down
and hammer out the provisions of a cease @-@ fire .
and if either of you decide to break the treaty ...
he or she will be excommunicated .
we &apos;ll no longer be your friends .
well , i suppose as i leave my teens ,
that i should start to think about my legacy .
i have no objection to order in the kingdom .
let the negotiations begin .
if you give me the standard on weeknights ,
i &apos;ll give you the carlyle for the entire christmas season .
done , but i want an addendum that you can &apos;t bed hostesses
from a roster of restaurants i frequent .
you can &apos;t have fashion week in both paris and milan .
you have to choose .
never , but i will give you art basel
in miami and switzerland .
okay , moving on to article 47--
strip clubs in the outer boroughs .
sidebar .
why are we sidebar @-@ ing ?
do you really want access to strip clubs ?
no , i just don &apos;t want to seem
like i &apos;m ceding territory too easily .
so pretend like we &apos;re talking about something serious ,
like my birthday , or have you figured out
that anniversary situation ?
b. , what can i do ? they &apos;re already planning a family thing .
unacceptable ...
just like that sex glow you &apos;re sporting .
there was no sex . just coffee .
coffee is the thing you have before you pay the check
to go have sex .
it &apos;s different . colin is--
our professor ?
the one you promised to stay away from
except where class is concerned ?
which is why we &apos;re only meeting during office hours .
you are one macchiato away from making the same mistake
that you always make , and i won &apos;t be an accomplice ,
especially not on my almost @-@ birthday .
okay , fine , then i won &apos;t mention him anymore .
i cede the strip clubs .
ugh . then that concludes the treaty .
actually , there &apos;s one more point i want to negotiate--in private .
attorneys , you &apos;re dismissed .
well , i guess we know why chuck didn &apos;t answer the phone .
of course chuck and blair go to war
and end up happier than ever ,
leaving jenny and our family in a pile of rubble .
yeah , it figures . rubble &apos;s their specialty .
although ... peace time would be
the perfect opportunity for a stealth strike .
oh , come on . how good would it feel
to finally give them a taste of their own medicine ?
not that we &apos;re the ones to give it to them .
well , hold on a second . what &apos;s wrong with us ?
i mean , i &apos;ve picked up a @-@ a few skills over the years ,
and you come from a long line of world @-@ class schemers .
we have righteousness
and our parents &apos; anniversary on our side .
no offense , dan , but we are no match for chuck and blair .
i don &apos;t know about that .
seems like leaves
aren &apos;t the only things changing colors this fall .
so that &apos;s it . the war is over .
no more blackmail , angry asides , or sadistic schemes .
we &apos;re not a couple . we &apos;re not at war .
we officially have no reason to interact beyond social niceties .
what a huge relief .
i guess this is good @-@ bye .
let us not forget article 19--
no touching . take care , chuck .
serena !
oh , are you picking up something for blair &apos;s birthday ?
a first edition ? that &apos;s really thoughtful .
actually , blair &apos;s getting
a special delivery from bergdorf &apos;s .
this is for a professor .
that &apos;s an awfully nice gift for a professor .
you must really like his lectures .
or ... that &apos;s not all you like .
i may have a small crush .
tell me everything !
i &apos;ve been there myself , so no judgments ,
and my lips are sealed .
well , nothing &apos;s happened , and nothing &apos;s going to happen--
at least , not while he &apos;s my teacher .
i would never put my academic future at risk .
then what are you doing ?
just talking , getting to know each other
until the semester &apos;s over . the waiting is ...
actually amazing .
wow . that &apos;s great .
does he feel the same way ?
what do you mean ?
all books , no sex ?
i @-@ i hate to be the bearer of bad news ,
but he &apos;s a guy , and guys don &apos;t wait .
so if he &apos;s not getting it from you , then--
there &apos;s no way . he &apos;s , um--
different .
well , if not , i &apos;m here for advice .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome . bye .
got it .
its genius is in its simplicity .
we break the truce , drive a wedge between them .
then once the peace is off ,
chuck will be primed to help jenny in retaliation .
okay , so what would enrage chuck bass ?
his maybe mother ? his late father ? jack bass .
that &apos;s perfect .
gossip girl will be thrilled to hear about a secret fling
with jack and blair last summer in the south of france ,
or how they &apos;re planning to do it again this christmas .
nice touch . are you sure we aren &apos;t really related ?
all right , so i run into chuck ,
offer my condolences that blair can &apos;t be trusted ,
suggest the best way to retaliate is
offer amnesty to jenny , and as an added bonus , my dad and lily
get the first anniversary they deserve .
let &apos;s see how strong the holy alliance is
after this air strike .
hello ?
surprise ! it &apos;s me !
serena , i don &apos;t think coming here is a good idea .
i &apos;m just dropping off a copy of my favorite book ,
&quot; the beautiful and damned . &quot;
where is she ? i know she &apos;s up here .
serena , meet ...
ilana .
my housekeeper .
you , uh , were jealous of my housekeeper .
i saw you get her from a cab .
i always pay her cab fare .
stop smiling .
she &apos;s gorgeous , and i &apos;m going a little crazy here .
i know . me , too .
let &apos;s be honest .
we may sit across from each other ,
talking about bagels versus brioche ,
but all we &apos;re thinking--
is what it would be like to have breakfast in bed ?
okay , as much as it-- it kills me to say this ,
no more office hours .
i just can &apos;t be alone in a room with you .
so other than class ,
i &apos;ll see you in six weeks .
other than tonight . the dean just e @-@ mailed
that my presence is requested at a party
apparently at your place .
you &apos;re invited to blair &apos;s birthday ?
s. , i can &apos;t talk now .
did you invite the entire columbia faculty
to your party tonight ?
i may have invited the dean and whomever she favors .
why do you care ? you &apos;re not going .
well , the anniversary party was canceled , so yes , i am .
and now it turns out so is colin .
unless you mean firth or farrell , i &apos;m not listening ,
the dean will be there . need i say more ?
chuck . hey . uh , hey , man . i was just stopping by to see nate .
but i @-@ i guess he &apos;s not here .
he &apos;s in his room .
oh , he is ? he &apos;s not--he &apos;s not at class ? i would &apos;ve thought--
you really don &apos;t know how to stage a run @-@ in , do you ?
cut to the chase .
well , uh , since blair betrayed you with your uncle ,
i thought maybe you could betray her back ,
call my sister , offer her protection .
well , you &apos;re just about six months late for that ,
aren &apos;t ya , humphrey ?
hey , i , uh , i didn &apos;t expect to see you here . i assumed ...
that chuck and i would be back at war
after that silly &quot; gossip girl &quot; blast ?
it was obviously fake .
what gave you that idea ?
we have enemies , humphrey .
all powerful people do .
we anticipated someone would try to mess with us .
and this handiwork
has your lying little sister &apos;s fingerprints all over it .
besides , jack bass wasn &apos;t in france last summer .
he was in chile .
again , uh , how did you know that ?
i must &apos;ve read about it somewhere .
regardless , this incident inspired us to add
a new addendum to the treaty . the notary just left .
now wait wait a second . there--there--there &apos;s a treaty ?
like an actual legal document ?
humphrey , the intricacies of our war games
are too complex for prole like you to fathom .
as an additional gesture of trust , chuck ,
i would like to invite you to my birthday party this evening .
i gratefully accept .
and since gothic barbie remains safely quarantined upstate ,
feel free to stop by if you &apos;re feeling lonely .
serena . hey .
so it turns out you were wrong about the professor .
he is waiting for me . but waiting is not easy .
i don &apos;t trust myself to be in a room with him .
i &apos;m sorry . normally , i would talk to blair about this ,
but she doesn &apos;t approve .
some people are such prudes .
well , anyway , we agreed to stay away from each other ,
but tonight we both have to go to blair &apos;s birthday ,
and a lot of faculty are going , including the dean .
the dean ? no kidding .
i get it . what you need is a buffer--
someone to stay by your side , distract you ,
make sure you two are never alone all night .
i &apos;m happy to help .
really ? thank you .
of course , although
i &apos;m not sure how blair will feel about me being at her party .
well , you &apos;ll be my guest .
and--and maybe it &apos;s a good idea . she &apos;ll get to know the real you .
thank you .
my pleasure . you &apos;ve put yourself in the right hands .
uh @-@ oh . juliet &apos;s plans are falling into place ,
and s. is primed for a fall .
hey , man , do you know anything about , uh ,
chuck and blair &apos;s so @-@ called peace treaty ?
yeah , of course . it was my idea .
you know , they &apos;re really trying to change .
i highly doubt that , but do you by any chance know what &apos;s in it ?
i &apos;m sorry , man . i can &apos;t tell you that .
i gave my word i &apos;d guard it .
security &apos;s coming to pick it up and put it in the safe .
anyway , there &apos;s stuff in there
serena and i don &apos;t even know about .
chuck and blair made us leave early .
wait a second . you saw serena ? i thought we agreed .
you don &apos;t have to worry about it , okay ?
she &apos;s seeing someone else .
can we talk about this later ? i &apos;m late for class .
nate thought he and humphrey were thick as thieves .
turns out humphrey &apos;s a thief ,
and nate &apos;s just thick .
just the man i was looking for .
so i assume you &apos;re going to blair &apos;s birthday party tonight ?
yep . solo , now that things are over with juliet .
that &apos;s actually what i wanted to talk to you about .
um , she &apos;s gonna be my date .
i thought she left me for someone else .
i didn &apos;t know it was you .
come on . that guy i was telling you about ...
uh , we &apos;re--we &apos;re trying to stay away from each other ,
and he &apos;s gonna be there tonight , so juliet offered to chaperone
so that i stay strong .
well , if all you need is a buffer , let me take you .
well , i don &apos;t want to make him jealous .
no , we &apos;re just friends . let &apos;s be honest .
it &apos;s better to have a guy protect you from another guy .
you do have a point .
i know i do , plus i &apos;d rather not run into juliet ,
so you &apos;d be doing me a favor , too .
okay .
juliet , hey . uh , change of plans .
i actually don &apos;t need your help anymore tonight .
are you sure ?
yeah , yeah , so you can go back to whatever it is
i took you away from doing . thank you , though .
yeah .
bye @-@ bye .
you put gladiolas in my cabbage roses ? !
the waldorf &apos;s is not a best western .
get them out .
darling , i just got off the phone with rufus and lily .
i told them if they can &apos;t be with family ,
they might as well be with friends .
we have to do something special for them .
i suppose powerful women can afford to be generous .
so i &apos;ll have to think of some kind of anniversary surprise .
how &apos;s the guest list coming ?
everyone &apos;s who &apos;s anyone will be here .
but i @-@ i couldn &apos;t help but notice
a certain charles cass has been added to the list .
blair , we don &apos;t need any trouble .
he &apos;ll be no trouble , mother . he and i are good .
yeah , so good you have been berating the help all day .
i &apos;m not berating anyone !
i just want to be sure that the party is perfect .
your dress , miss blair .
are you kidding ?
what part of &quot; j. mendel , &quot;
did you not understand ?
actually , dear , i picked it out .
dorota ...
what &apos;s going on with me ?
you aren &apos;t fighting with mr. chuck ,
so you fight with everyone else .
take it upstairs .
that &apos;s their biggest secret ?
i @-@ i was expecting something
a little bit more &quot; american psycho &quot; --
not stabbing a homeless man ,
but at least feeding a cat to an a.t.m.
a birthday surprise may be in order .
i think all it &apos;ll take is a couple of calls .
look , dan , i know we want jenny to come in for the anniversary ,
but she fought back last week and nearly lost
everything she learned . you told her that yourself .
uh , maybe we shouldn &apos;t risk the same .
no , we should . they deserve it .
they &apos;re--they &apos;re--they &apos;re smug and they are condescending .
they have treaties . and we &apos;re doing it for jenny .
dan , we tried . it didn &apos;t work .
i &apos;m out , and i @-@ i @-@ i hope you are , too .
hi . uh , hi . rita . this is dan ,
rufus humphrey &apos;s son .
yeah , i hope you don &apos;t mind me calling , but , uh ,
i have a very good friend with a birthday party tonight ,
and--and i was hoping i could get your help .
yeah , do you still work at interscope ?
looks like brooklyn &apos;s in it to win it .
just what is it exactly ?
guess we &apos;ll find out tonight .
hi , love .
now i know it &apos;s a party .
oh , stop . you look ... so chic .
cheers .
thanks .
dean reuther ,
i am so thrilled you could make it .
happy birthday , blair .
the guest list is inspired .
thank you for inviting me ... and my faculty .
well , thank you ,
and i hope you get a chance to chat
with patricia ireland .
i think she &apos;d be really interested in that paper you
wrote for &quot; yale law review &quot; on planned parenthood v. casey .
you read that ?
of course .
every woman who cares about her right to choose should .
you know , blair ,
i think another we should get to know each other better .
i &apos;ll have my assistant set up lunch .
o.m.g.
the last girl the dean took to lunch
became c.e.o. of pepsi .
here you go .
i was happy with eating shun lee out of the carton , lily .
this is all just very upper east side .
look , i know you think you &apos;re rock &apos; n &apos; roll ,
but you are wearing a $ 2,000 jacket .
happy anniversary ...
oh ! thank you .
to you !
that &apos;s a gorgeous ... blazer .
thanks for getting me in ,
but i should go before anybody sees us together .
of course . have fun .
that guy i told you about is here .
please distract me .
okay .
don &apos;t look over there , but my lit professor--
look at his pants . look at &apos; em .
i bet you 10 bucks they &apos;re held up with a rubber band .
he wears them every single day . yeah , it &apos;s ridiculous .
dan , hey . i didn &apos;t realize you were coming .
yeah , it was kind of a last minute thing .
i @-@ i , uh , i didn &apos;t know you were coming together .
oh , no . we &apos;re--we &apos;re not--
you know something ? i &apos;m gonna go--i &apos;m gonna
hit the cheese table . i &apos;ll see you later .
serena .
hi .
so ... this is your new buffer .
yeah . i didn &apos;t know you were still coming .
i came with a friend . it &apos;s nice to see you two having fun .
yeah , well , you &apos;re not exactly dying of loneliness .
nate ...
can you give us a moment , please ?
yeah .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry .
i hope it &apos;s not too awkward that i came with him .
i know things are difficult between you two right now .
no , it &apos;s okay . i &apos;m-- i &apos;m not worried about nate .
so ... where is the mysterious professor ?
hmm ? which one is he ?
i &apos;m not gonna tell you that .
nate &apos;s gone off and left you alone .
how am i supposed to step in to be your backup
if i don &apos;t know who to protect you from ?
okay , but you can &apos;t tell anyone .
i could kill the caterer .
the appetizer tray looks like a rorschach test .
you ! you &apos;re ... you &apos;re the one
who did such a wonderful job at the fashion &apos;s night out .
come . help me with those trays .
why are you talking to that horrible juliet ,
and what are you doing here with nate ?
well , you &apos;ll be happy to know that colin and i--
hey ! my ears don &apos;t register his name .
are trying to stay away from each other ,
which is why i brought nate as a buffer .
and since you won &apos;t listen to my colin problems ,
i had to go to juliet for advice .
serena , do you have amnesia ? juliet isn &apos;t your friend .
she &apos;s actually proven to be a pretty good friend
since she saved me from vanessa &apos;s takedown .
oh , please , if i want to hear fiction ,
i &apos;ll go talk to jonathan franzen . in fact ...
son ! what are you doing here ?
i could say the same to you . i @-@ i thought you were
gonna be having your romantic night alone at home .
eleanor convinced them to come celebrate among friends .
oh , no . but--but--but you-- but you can &apos;t stay here .
it &apos;d be bad luck .
you know , everything here is on china and crystal . you gotta--
you gotta go home and celebrate on paper plates as planned .
you know , i am surprised that you are so superstitious , dan .
let &apos;s face it . our plan to stay at home was pretty depressing .
yeah , let &apos;s go check out
those cookies in the shape of blair &apos;s shoes .
okay .
hey , why--why--why didn &apos;t you warn me they were coming ?
i didn &apos;t think i needed to .
oh , you didn &apos;t actually go through with it , did ...
oh , you did . uh , okay .
can--can--can you put a stop to it before it &apos;s too late ?
you look lovely tonight .
it &apos;s so cold in here . i can barely feel my fingers .
cold ? i &apos;m practically feverish .
i must tell dorota to turn up the air .
just one thing before you go .
i was wondering-- how did you know where jack was ?
i think i must have read it online .
that &apos;s strange . last i heard , he was off the grid .
well , if you &apos;ll excuse me , i &apos;m entertaining .
good to see you , serena . i better go find eleanor
before she wonders why i haven &apos;t said hello .
good to see you , too , cynthia .
nice meeting you .
okay , see ? that was a great distraction , right ?
what are you look-- what are you looking at ?
he &apos;s flirting with someone .
don &apos;t look at him . look at me .
okay , remember when mrs. salazar made us memorize
the gettysburg address ?
look at me and recite it .
what ?
just do it . just go .
&quot; four score and--and-- and seven years ago ... &quot;
okay .
&quot; our fathers ... &quot;
don &apos;t flair your nostrils at me .
&quot; brought to this continent , a new nation , uh ... &quot;
keep going .
&quot; conceived in liberty ... &quot;
you &apos;re doing well .
&quot; and dedicated to the proposition &quot;
that you are an incredible chaperone .
i know .
oh , hi , darling .
nate , serena , hello .
hey , happy anniversary . i &apos;m so glad we can all be together .
oh , thank you , darling .
well , it looks like you &apos;re in good hands now .
i &apos;ll catch up with you later .
excuse me .
uh , you wouldn &apos;t happen to be ben , would you ?
i &apos;m sorry ?
i just saw you with juliet .
i figured if you &apos;re the guy she left me for ,
then your name must be--
ben ? no .
i &apos;m sorry . my mistake .
miss , i have a note for you .
paper plates are bad for the environment .
oh , come on , rufus .
it &apos;s not gonna kill anyone
if we use paper plates just for one day .
uh , excuse me . i &apos;m going to the restroom .
i mean , we all have to do our part .
when was the last time you used a paper plate ?
nate ! come on . i need a drink .
yeah , the bar is right here . we can just--
yeah , well , screw the bar .
we keep the good stuff in the kitchen . come with me .
i don &apos;t believe it . you &apos;ve been seeing ben ? !
shh ! we can &apos;t talk about this here , okay ?
please ?
no one can see us together .
okay ?
fine .
but you bet your ass we &apos;re talking about this .
so that is the guy that juliet broke up with me for .
he just lied to my face .
juliet &apos;s dating him , too ?
&quot; too &quot; ?
so is serena .
i knew that juliet was evil .
i have to go warn serena .
if you left me for that guy ,
you can say so .
you know , why is it such a big secret ?
it &apos;s not what you think .
now if you don &apos;t mind ...
no , first ... you &apos;re gonna tell me what &apos;s going on .
you &apos;ve lied to me enough .
he &apos;s my cousin , nate .
and the reason we don &apos;t want people to know
is because he &apos;s a teacher ,
and i &apos;m a student--
and he &apos;s dating serena .
oh , my god .
she borrow my tiara . she not give it back yet .
but that okay .
she is 20 .
she deserve 20 tiaras .
she has great heart ,
style , and grace ...
even when she get mad .
happy birthday , miss blair !
hi , everyone .
i &apos;m rita ,
and i &apos;d also like to salute the birthday girl ,
and i brought some special friends
to help me with the toast .
or ... should i say &quot; roast &quot; ?
who is that woman ?
robyn . she &apos;s an incredible musician .
hey , i tried rita &apos;s cell and got no answer .
i @-@ i @-@ i think she &apos;s busy .
luckily , robyn was working with me
in new york this week
and able to bring along
a very special video of blair .
what is it ?
a jack bass sex tape ?
a nelly yuki snuff film ?
let me take you back to
a summer night in stockholm ,
to an afterparty for one of robyn &apos;s shows .
no .
hey !
blair
just kidding !
no ! no !
hey , robyn . jealous ?
is she all right ?
i &apos;m fine .
i &apos;m coming on tour !
i ...
die .
how could you bring that video here ?
i &apos;m sorry . i got a call . he said it was a roast .
of course he did .
&quot; he &quot; who ?
charles bartholomew bass .
who else ?
i told you not to invite him .
you were flirting with that model .
you were flirting with that lacrosse player .
he &apos;s my friend ,
and i was just using him to stay away from you .
you were trying to make me jealous ?
no , i wasn &apos;t .
but were you jealous ?
we &apos;re in your bedroom .
i don &apos;t think i can make it six weeks .
well , maybe staying away from each other is so hard
because that &apos;s not what we should be doing .
maybe ...
i am in complete agreement .
i really want this , but not here .
you know how ashamed i am of that video .
&quot; stand by your man &quot; ?
gossip girl is offering a cash reward .
it only takes one video to topple an entire career .
if you don &apos;t believe me , just youtube &quot; connie chung piano . &quot;
blair , just listen to me .
why did you do it , huh ?
because i knew that jack was in chile last summer ?
i only found out because
i was desperate for news of you .
you were ?
all summer , when i was pretending not to care ,
i wanted to know where you were .
i paid a private eye to look ,
but the only bass he got was your scaly uncle .
blair , as much as i hate being at peace with you ,
i didn &apos;t do this .
if you can stand there and lie to my face ,
then you &apos;re either pure evil or just a common sociopath .
you really believe that ?
of course i do !
and even if nate and serena peeked at the treaty ,
you &apos;re the only one with a motive .
actually , there was someone else .
is this a joke ?
you did this ?
my sister doesn &apos;t feel safe to live in her own house
or be with her parents on their anniversary .
she was a different person before she met the two of you .
come on , dan . it &apos;s not about jenny .
it may have started out that way ,
but this is about you and getting revenge ,
and you went behind my back to get it .
i know , nate , but come on . they deserve what they get .
i &apos;m not sorry .
no , i &apos;m the one who &apos;s sorry .
i &apos;m sorry you &apos;ve become one of them .
blair , we had a treaty .
okay , we have a big problem .
serena &apos;s professor is colin-- our cousin colin .
and what &apos;s the problem ?
he has no idea what we &apos;re doing !
if he finds out , i @-@ i will lose everything !
don &apos;t tell me about losing everything .
i &apos;m sorry .
i know that there &apos;s no love lost between you two , but i need him .
he pays for my school , my rent .
what you need is to get serena caught with her professor ,
whoever he is .
did you get the proof like we talked about ?
not yet , but , ben , he obviously has no idea who she is ,
that &apos;s she &apos;s the one responsible for all--
it &apos;s because she &apos;s responsible that you have to do this .
it is the only way to make things right .
it is the only way for our family to ever move on .
now please , jules , get the proof and get serena expelled .
robyn gave this to me ,
and she swore it was her only copy .
you are safe .
well , that &apos;s good news , i guess .
but i &apos;m still mortified .
dean reuther saw it . madeleine albright .
i @-@ i &apos;m a failure at 20 .
are you kidding ? elsa maxwell says
that a good party gives people what they don &apos;t expect .
well ... i suppose watching rachel zoe
get dipped in chocolate like a strawberry wasn &apos;t boring .
nothing around you ever is .
something else is wrong ?
what i want is to be a powerful woman .
but whenever chuck &apos;s around ,
i just feel like a weak little girl .
i shut myself off for a long time after your father left .
i was cold and hard . then i met cyrus ,
and he taught me that sometimes
you have to allow yourself to be weak
in order to grow stronger .
well , that sounds good , but it feels terrible .
you don &apos;t have to lose the girl to be a woman .
just ... need to think
maybe about how many people are going to be around
the next time you let her out .
i am going to bed .
good night .
it was just a silly karaoke video .
at least no one got hurt .
yeah , i just--i &apos;ve never seen dan like that .
i pray it &apos;s an isolated event .
i &apos;d hate to think i lost both my kids to the upper east side .
well , i &apos;d hate for you to think that , too .
what ?
that &apos;s a lot of paper .
eric ! did you do this ?
well , i helped , but it was all dan .
well , maybe there &apos;s a little humphrey left
in that kid after all .
you know , there are ten minutes left of our anniversary .
you know , just enough time to save it .
so i wrecked blair &apos;s birthday and i betrayed nate ,
i &apos;ve disappointed my dad , and as the icing on the cake ,
i pretty much ruined his and lily &apos;s anniversary .
other than that ... how was your night ?
it was blair &apos;s 20th birthday party ,
and i &apos;m still acting like an eighth grader !
oh , my god .
is it possible the upper east side is contagious ?
i think we &apos;ve proven that it is .
we just need some rest and a good dose of brooklyn .
yeah . thanks for being here .
we &apos;ve been friends forever , and that &apos;s not gonna change .
dad , i am so sorry .
wait a second . you liked it ?
at the end of every war , the warriors come home ,
hoping what they &apos;ve seen and done
won &apos;t stay with them forever .
anthony patch is more tragic than gatsby .
i can &apos;t believe you actually read it .
well , why wouldn &apos;t i ? you gave it to me .
you know , i think i like you too much to do this right now .
we &apos;ve come this far ,
and the old me would &apos;ve gone farther ,
but the new me really wants to wait .
i &apos;m glad i know the new you .
she &apos;s a great teacher .
ugh . so , six more weeks ...
yeah . at least we stopped ourselves
before we made a mess of everything .
no one found out , so we &apos;re safe .
well , in that case ...
buddha once said ,
&quot; it &apos;s better to conquer yourself
than to win a thousand battles . &quot;
but other soldiers can &apos;t give up the fight
and go underground to plan the next war .
something to look forward to .
see ya .
but it &apos;s the true warrior who knows that wars don &apos;t end .
they simply change .
and there can never be peace
as long as guns are still loaded
and there &apos;s plenty of ammunition .
what are you still doing here , chuck ?
i threw you out hours ago .
i wanted to let you know the treaty is over .
fine with me .
this pretense of civility was exhausting .
being amicable isn &apos;t in our blood .
i &apos;ve realized we &apos;re not friends .
friends have to like each other .
and after what happened tonight , i could never like you .
i could never like you either .
in fact , i hate you .
i &apos;ve never hated anyone ... more .
every nerve ending in my body is electrified by hatred .
there is a fiery pit of hate burning inside me ,
ready to explode .
so it &apos;s ... settled then ?
we &apos;re settled .
these weapons may be deadly .
