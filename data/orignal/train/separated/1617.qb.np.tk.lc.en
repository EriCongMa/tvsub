who was that guy ?
that was liam .
the foster brother you told me about ?
you know what you did to me .
go get the rest of your stuff and get home , please .
no , mom . i &apos;m gonna live here with cortney .
i want to see mason .
if you wanted to see him ,
you shouldn &apos;t have bailed on taking him tonight .
it &apos;s come to our attention
that you allowed a registered sex offender
to build sets for a school play ?
i &apos;m aaron .
cameron .
so why law school ?
i &apos;ve been interning at the juvenile justice project .
well , i burned down the warehouse ,
so they gonna send me to jail anyway .
nick , don &apos;t .
i love you . but we can &apos;t be together
if you hurt yourself .
okay , it &apos;s okay now , nick , it &apos;s all over .
can we not talk about it anymore ?
i just want to be done with it , you know ?
mariana ...
it &apos;s me , nick .
texting your lover ?
yeah , i &apos;m letting her know i can &apos;t hook up tomorrow night
since it &apos;s my first wedding anniversary .
does this mean that we &apos;re not gonna celebrate
our first kiss anniversary anymore ?
we absolutely are .
i want credit for those 10 years .
we can celebrate both .
plus valentine &apos;s day . that &apos;s a lot of expensive meals .
can we afford this ?
you deserve it .
you never treat yourselves .
you should go to island prime .
sorry we woke you , honey .
it &apos;s okay .
to wash my hair before school anyways .
maybe we should take out a restraining order against nick ?
oh , because that was so successful with brandon ?
no , it &apos;s fine .
nick is in a secure treatment center .
and they &apos;ve taken away his phone privileges .
fine .
a restraining order is not gonna make mariana any safer .
might have the opposite effect on nick .
what are we gonna do ? she &apos;s been in here every night .
well , just keep up with her counseling
and be patient .
brandon , on the other hand ...
give him time .
it &apos;s been long enough , if you ask me .
he &apos;s in a honeymoon period .
once that wears off and
responsibilities of being on his own start piling up ,
he &apos;ll come running back with his tail between his legs .
which is a lot better
than with his middle finger in the air .
yep .
you okay ?
yeah . yeah , yeah .
when mason gets used to the new place ,
i &apos;ll work on getting him to stay in his own bed .
oh , yeah , no , it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s no problem .
i &apos;ll make it up to you this weekend .
are you worried eddie might bail ?
i hope not ,
for mason &apos;s sake .
i am a little nervous though .
i &apos;ve never even spent a night away from him .
well , you deserve a break .
i was thinking maybe we should have a party .
i think a party would be fun .
i think we should do it .
excuse me , are you new here ?
oh , uh , yeah , yeah . this is my first day .
maybe you could show me around a little bit ?
yeah , no , sorry . i &apos;m not very rah @-@ rah .
but if you &apos;re free after school ,
i have this senior project i &apos;ve been working on .
maybe you could keep me company ?
oh , yeah ?
yeah , i think i could do that .
i &apos;m callie , by the way .
aj .
welcome to anchor beach .
some of the parents pulled their kids out after the lockdown ,
so they had a spot for aj .
so how does he feel about being transferred
in the middle of his senior year ?
he &apos;s happy to be going to a better school .
especially one that callie goes to .
so that &apos;s still on ?
seems to be .
who can tell with those two ?
and what about us two ?
are we on ?
well , i &apos;m just giving you some space .
giving space or taking it ?
are you still mad that i went after gabe at brandon &apos;s party ?
i &apos;m not mad , i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m just worried .
i think he &apos;s a trigger .
the minute he came back into your life , you slipped .
okay .
&quot; okay &quot; ?
i won &apos;t see him again .
i don &apos;t want any space between us .
i want you .
i want you , too .
how about right now ?
so what are you gonna do with all these pictures ?
i don &apos;t know exactly .
it &apos;s a photo essay .
so maybe , like , on a big canvas ,
a mixed media collage .
is there , like , a reason you &apos;re doing this ?
so i &apos;ll graduate .
i mean when you &apos;re done and people look at it .
why should they care ?
gee , thanks a lot .
well ?
is there something you &apos;re trying to say ?
i &apos;m saying that i was in seven homes in seven years .
probably , like , write about how i felt in each house .
and i guess the reason is ...
to try to figure out why it &apos;s hard for me
to trust anything is permanent .
so what will you write about this house ?
that i felt safe .
i mean , until social workers showed up one day
and took us away .
they say why ?
do they ever ?
it was confusing though &apos; cause they were really nice
and we thought they wanted to adopt us .
but i guess not .
i do wonder what happened .
why don &apos;t you go ask ?
just knock on the door . maybe they still live there .
i &apos;m not doing that .
why not ?
because that &apos;s not the point of the project .
i &apos;m not interviewing my old foster parents .
it &apos;s not about them .
it &apos;s about me .
okay .
i &apos;m getting fired .
love , they can &apos;t do that .
yes , they can .
a registered sex offender
helped build sets for a school play and i knew it .
okay , there &apos;s gotta be something we can do .
something i can do .
i was the one that suggested it in the first place .
do we have $ 20,000 ?
what ?
monte knows this attorney who specializes
in helping people get off the list ,
and that &apos;s the discount rate .
okay , how does this help you ?
well , if he can get gabe &apos;s record expunged ,
it &apos;s like he was never on the list
and then we did nothing wrong .
all right , well , i hate to tell you this , honey ,
but we don &apos;t have $ 20,000 .
we do on a line of credit on the house ...
uh , that is for emergencies .
well , i think this is an emergency , honey .
if lose my job , i lose my income ...
okay , okay .
what if we do pay the lawyer ?
you know , the fact of the matter is
that gabe doesn &apos;t want us helping him .
he made that perfectly clear .
how many of these places are we going to today ?
this is only the second one .
whoa , hey now .
you didn &apos;t say anything about breaking and entering .
i &apos;m not breaking and entering . i &apos;m trespassing .
so what &apos;s the story of this house ?
not a happy one .
i was raped by my foster brother .
callie !
what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m taking some photos of the houses i &apos;ve been in .
but we &apos;ll leave now .
don &apos;t go .
i &apos;d like to talk to you .
please . come inside ?
i &apos;m glad to see you , callie .
i &apos;ve had a lot of time to think lately
with liam in prison and my husband ...
we &apos;re divorcing .
anyway .
i &apos;m at an age when you tend to ...
reflect back on the mistakes you &apos;ve made in life .
the mistakes that have haunted me the most
are the ones i made with you , callie .
you have no idea
how sorry i am .
sorry we ever brought you into this house ...
and allowed you to destroy our lives .
my son is not a rapist
or a thief .
but his life is in ruins .
and so is mine .
so , take your pictures
of a house that &apos;s no longer a home
because of you .
sorry you brought me into this house , too .
hey , what are you doing ?
getting my pictures .
it hasn &apos;t changed .
what are you doing ?
huh ?
uh , playing piano .
in the bathroom ?
uh , well , you know , i ... i was ...
so you &apos;re having a party and you didn &apos;t invite me ?
what &apos;s up with that ?
who told you i was having a party ?
mat , who heard from jasper .
seriously ? you &apos;re not inviting your sister ?
guess now that you moved out , you don &apos;t care about us anymore .
that &apos;s not true , okay ? and it &apos;s not really a party .
all right ?
what &apos;s not a party ?
oh , hey . you &apos;re home early .
yeah .
well , what you up to ?
oh , i just came to practice .
good . well , that &apos;s good .
what &apos;s in the bag ?
oh , uh ... not much .
just , uh , i was running low on a few things , so , you know .
oh , were you ?
yeah .
yeah ? like what ?
like , you know , soap
and a tube of toothpaste and toilet paper .
oh , i see . that &apos;s a bummer , huh ?
well , you know , this is a house , b. not a target .
so , unless you &apos;re gonna pay for those , i &apos;m gonna ...
yeah .
she &apos;s here .
okay .
sorry to keep you waiting .
oh , i just got here .
can i get you some tea ?
nope . i &apos;m ... i &apos;m good .
we appreciate you being here .
is everything okay ?
not exactly .
we wanted to talk to you about gabe .
so this is liam &apos;s house ?
yeah .
it &apos;s amazing what horrors can lie behind a white picket fence .
yeah , right ?
wait , what &apos;s that ?
that was my bedroom .
you went inside ?
yeah , his mom drove up
when we were outside and invited me in .
why ?
to tell me how i ruined their lives
like she was the victim .
do you think it &apos;s safe to go inside these homes ?
i don &apos;t know , but i think i have to .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s enough to just stand outside .
i think i need to go in ,
face the people that made me feel powerless , you know ?
so we still haven &apos;t talked about
what happened with brandon this afternoon .
hey , you &apos;re the one that said we need to
let him feel the responsibility of being on his own .
like depriving him of toothpaste ?
if that &apos;s what it takes .
come in !
hey , love . what &apos;s up ?
don &apos;t worry , i &apos;m not coming to sleep with you .
honey , you know you can stay in here
as long as you need to .
i think i know what might help
make me feel safe from nick .
yeah ? what &apos;s that ?
i think what i need to do is ...
i need to go see him .
i mean , he was on time and he couldn &apos;t have been nicer .
really ? &apos; cause i was thinking maybe i shouldn &apos;t have told him
that i &apos;m living here .
he seems okay with it .
you know , eddie wasn &apos;t always a jerk .
you know what ? we should celebrate .
maybe we should have a party .
great idea !
hi , guys .
momma .
brandon , cortney .
hello .
well , someone &apos;s thirsty .
oh . uh , you know what ?
cort , maybe you should take your beer ...
yeah .
... that i won &apos;t be drinking &apos; cause i &apos;m not 21 .
nice to see you again .
just gonna take these inside .
well , it looks like someone is having a party .
oh . oh , you know what ? no , it &apos;s not a party .
we &apos;re just inviting a few friends , yeah .
it &apos;s more like a gathering actually .
ah , well ...
yeah .
yeah .
well , i was just out doing a little shopping
and i thought i would pick you up a few things ,
but it looks like maybe you don &apos;t need them .
uh , actually , you know what ?
i can totally take those right now .
great .
does mom know ?
does she need to ?
do you , uh ...
maybe want to come inside , check the place out ?
uh , maybe another time .
we miss you .
i miss you , too .
be responsible , please .
i will .
can i help you ?
hi , sheila .
do you remember me ?
callie ?
oh , callie ! come in !
your project sounds wonderful .
i just hope you remember this home
as a safe and loving one .
i do , yeah .
you and tom were really nice to us .
tom passed away last year .
i &apos;m really sorry .
thank you .
it &apos;s been hard .
especially for kyle ,
losing the only father he ever knew .
so you adopted kyle ?
yes .
can i ask why you didn &apos;t keep me and jude ?
didn &apos;t they tell you ?
no .
they promised to tell you .
we wanted to keep you ,
but because of our age and kyle &apos;s special needs ,
they wouldn &apos;t let us adopt all three of you .
kyle had special needs ?
yes . you remember , he had dyslexia
and impulse control issues .
no , i just remember him being really sweet
and kind of like jude .
i felt terrible when they took you away .
but you and jude had each other
and kyle was all alone .
and callie ...
i am so sorry .
no , it &apos;s okay . i understand .
how is kyle ?
kyle is in prison .
well , in juvenile detention until he turns 18 .
then he &apos;ll go to an adult facility .
for how long ?
the rest of his life .
the legal term is &quot; nunc pro tunc , &quot;
meaning &quot; then for now . &quot;
basically , it allows us to go back in time ,
re @-@ try the case with the original ada and judge .
why would i want to re @-@ try my case ?
because the laws have changed .
and today , i believe you &apos;d be found factually innocent .
frankly , you never should have been required
to register as a sex offender in the first place .
how much is this gonna cost me ?
lena and i would be willing to cover your legal costs .
no . no , i &apos;m not comfortable with that .
it could be a loan that you would pay back .
how ? i don &apos;t have any money .
well , we thought that if you were willing ,
you could do some work on the house maybe .
what &apos;s ... what &apos;s going on ?
hey , love . um ...
this is steve pargrave . he &apos;s a lawyer .
he thinks that maybe he could help gabe out with his situation .
oh . really ?
look ...
i &apos;m sorry you &apos;re in trouble because of me building those sets ,
and i don &apos;t want you to lose your job .
but i &apos;ve been offered a deal .
if i plead guilty and agree to relocate ,
i won &apos;t do any time .
where ... where would you go ?
i don &apos;t know . i have a friend who works in reno .
wherever you go , you &apos;ll have to register .
i know .
but i can &apos;t go back to prison .
look , i &apos;ve already had a preliminary conversation
with the ada , ellen wilkins ,
who indicated that she wouldn &apos;t object .
and i know ellen . she &apos;s a straight @-@ shooter .
if you plead guilty to this parole violation , you &apos;ll destroy
your chance of ever getting off the sex offender registry .
can you guarantee you can get me off the list ?
no , i can &apos;t .
but i believe the odds are definitely in your favor .
well , i &apos;ve never been a lucky person .
and this plea deal is guaranteed .
i &apos;m really sorry i can &apos;t help you .
so what happened ?
her name was martha johnson .
she lived a few blocks away .
she was always very kind to kyle .
he used to do a lot of odd jobs for her ,
and then when they found her dead , well ,
they rushed to judgment .
how long has kyle been in juvie ?
since the day he was arrested . almost four years .
they wouldn &apos;t give him bail
because he has distant relatives in cuba
and the prosecutor said he was a flight risk .
it was all so unfair .
police never looked at anybody else .
they just saw this former foster kid ,
a minority with developmental issues ,
and they assumed he did it .
we couldn &apos;t afford a lawyer ,
so all he had was a public defender
who i don &apos;t think ever believed he was innocent .
we even had an alibi witness ,
but he never even talked to him .
kyle never had anyone on his side .
he &apos;s only 17 .
and he &apos;s gonna spend the rest of his life in prison
for something i know in my heart that he didn &apos;t do .
your mom said i can come up .
look , um ...
i told you , i &apos;m ... i &apos;m not , uh , good at ...
i don &apos;t like ...
owing people .
or having people owe me anything .
i just ...
keep my head down , and that &apos;s how it is , you know ?
don &apos;t you ...
don &apos;t you ever get lonely ?
uh , i , um ...
at first he said no , but after he talked to jesus ,
he changed his mind ,
and i guess the ada , ellen wilkins ,
is supportive of gabe getting off the list .
so anyway , we &apos;re gonna go meet with the judge tomorrow .
this is a good thing .
yeah , he doesn &apos;t have to move away , so ...
that &apos;s gotta be a relief .
why are you being like this ?
you stood here less than 24 hours ago
and said you weren &apos;t gonna see him again .
and then stef and lena asked for my help .
and i feel guilty about gabe
being on the list all these years .
i feel like this is part of my amends .
come on ! your amends ?
he &apos;s the guy that got you into drugs in the first place .
he didn &apos;t make me an addict . i did that .
mike , this is important to me .
and why can &apos;t you have a little bit of compassion
about what gabe went through ?
i have compassion for you
and concern for your sobriety .
is that what you &apos;re concerned about ?
or are you worried i still have feelings for gabe ?
i don &apos;t know .
do you ?
how &apos;s it going ?
what &apos;s up , brother ?
are we the first ones here ?
oh , my friends don &apos;t show anywhere until after 10 : 00 earliest .
your friends don &apos;t have curfews .
true .
jasper &apos;s here .
oh , come in the kitchen !
we &apos;ve got beer and i &apos;m making skinny margaritas .
here you go .
what ?
little housewarming gift .
i heard you could use it .
ha @-@ ha , very funny .
yeah , i thought so .
actually , where &apos;s your bathroom at ?
are you serious ? you just got here .
you &apos;re gonna take a dump in the bathroom ?
well , i &apos;ve got no control over when nature calls .
yeah . and light a match .
and don &apos;t forget the courtesy flush .
seriously .
ellen . hey , it &apos;s mike foster .
good , good . how are you ?
oh , yeah . no rest for the weary , huh ?
listen , i wanted to talk to you about the petition
to get gabe duncroft off the sex offender registry .
oh , thank god you &apos;re here .
where &apos;s everyone else ?
we &apos;re it . boring .
what are you drinking ?
oh , it &apos;s cortney &apos;s skinny margarita .
splash of tequila .
oh , my god , that &apos;s not a splash .
you made it !
hey , cortney .
can i make you guys some margaritas ?
i &apos;ll just take a beer .
yeah , i &apos;m good with water . thank you .
oh , come on ! no fun ! it &apos;s a party !
uh , yeah , maybe later .
maryann , you want a refill ?
it &apos;s mariana , but no , i &apos;m good , thanks .
hello !
gabby !
finally ! finally !
ooh , let &apos;s get this party started !
girl , you got some catching up to do !
come on !
i never should have told you brandon was having a party .
yeah , well , probably not .
are we seriously going to spy on our son ?
we &apos;re not spying . we &apos;re checking on him .
we had a lovely dinner .
yes .
can &apos;t we just go home and continue celebrating
our anniversary before the kids get home , please ?
speaking of kids , is that our car ?
it &apos;s a very common car .
we can &apos;t be sure that that &apos;s our car .
6 @-@ q @-@ q @-@ c @-@ 6 @-@ 4 @-@ 2 .
you know our license plate ?
really ? that surprises you ?
i &apos;m a cop .
i cannot believe that our kids are at brandon &apos;s party .
what ...
really ? that surprises you ?
you &apos;re a parent of teenagers .
and by the looks of it , it &apos;s not much of a party .
it &apos;s more of a gathering .
how much paper did you use ?
not much , okay ?
we should just call a plumber .
no , no , no .
plumbers cost money .
well , if you can afford this place ,
i &apos;m sure you can afford a plumber .
i mean , what &apos;s the rent anyway ?
a lot .
are you paying like half ?
i guess i will be , yeah .
so , like , are you having sex all the time ?
so what do you guys do ?
we go to school .
college ?
high school .
oh . right .
forgot you were cougaring out .
shut up . refill ?
yeah , i &apos;ll come with you .
yeah ?
so what &apos;s the sex like ?
does he prematurely ejaculate ?
gabby !
thanks for comin &apos; .
what ?
thank you for inviting us .
yeah , yeah .
i see you got drinks .
yeah , it &apos;s the first time cortney &apos;s had a night off
from being a mom , so she &apos;s ...
oh , yeah . how is it being a dad ?
oh , i &apos;m not a dad .
mason &apos;s not my kid .
thanks .
why are you not more concerned about the fact
that our kids are at a party where there might be alcohol
and who knows what else available ?
first of all , it &apos;s probably not the first party
they &apos;ve been to where there &apos;s alcohol ,
and at least they &apos;re with brandon
and not some random house party with no parent home .
oh , yeah , no , that &apos;s right , there is a parent .
a 21 @-@ year @-@ old girl with a toddler .
i can &apos;t .
what ? what are you doing ?
honey , if you barge in there like momma cop ,
you are going to alienate all of those kids .
what ...
no , i &apos;m not going to barge .
now i &apos;m spying .
so it &apos;s really good to see you and mat back together again .
and ...
i &apos;m sorry i was hard on you about nick .
it wasn &apos;t cool .
it &apos;s okay .
ready for another ?
oh , no , i think i &apos;m good , thanks .
wh-- how many is that ?
who wants to know ?
okay then .
i don &apos;t think he got a fair trial .
apparently kyle had an alibi witness
who can verify that he was with him at the time of the murder .
his lawyers , public defenders , never looked into it .
well , maybe he had a reason .
or maybe he just didn &apos;t care .
sheila thinks he &apos;s innocent .
well , she &apos;s his mom .
if you knew kyle ,
he was so sweet and gentle .
it &apos;s hard to imagine him killing anyone .
he called you ?
but i thought he was locked up in a hospital .
well , he is , but ...
i mean , i don &apos;t know how ,
but somehow , he got to use a phone .
why-- why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
because i didn &apos;t want to freak you out .
well , i &apos;m freaked out .
well ...
you &apos;re gonna be more freaked out because ...
i &apos;m going to go see him tomorrow .
what ? why ?
because he still thinks that i &apos;m his girlfriend
and that we &apos;re gonna be together when he gets out .
yeah , because he &apos;s crazy .
no , because that &apos;s what i told him .
to get him to put the gun down .
i told him that i &apos;m still his girlfriend
and that ... i loved him .
okay .
well , i understand why you said those things ,
but why do you have to go see him ?
to tell him that i didn &apos;t mean any of it .
because as long as he thinks that i love him
and want to be with him , he &apos;s gonna want to be with me
and i &apos;m not gonna feel safe .
i don &apos;t know .
i just ... i guess i just need to ...
wait . oh , my god !
what ?
i-- i think i just saw my mom .
guys , mom &apos;s here .
wait , someone &apos;s mom &apos;s here ?
are you sure ?
yeah , i just saw her in the window , i think .
i &apos;m out .
is cortney here ?
uh ... yeah .
come on in .
can i , uh , get you a beer ?
oh , no thanks .
are you cortney strathmore ?
yes .
cool .
you &apos;ve been served .
anyone home ?
we &apos;re in here !
hi , guys . how was your night ?
fine .
yeah , it was good .
good .
how was your night ?
oh , it was great .
we actually took your suggestion .
we went to island prime .
mmm . delicious . i &apos;m stuffed .
oh , yeah ? well , and then what &apos;d you do ?
why would you ask us that ?
no reason .
but , you know , we did get you guys flowers .
and a card !
no way ! oh , my goodness .
happy anniversary .
thank you so much .
well , goodnight .
night .
night !
good night , my babies .
idiot .
i know what i saw .
you really want that ?
yeah , i really do .
what is it , like your fourth ?
you &apos;re not my dad .
you &apos;re also not mason &apos;s .
but , you know , i don &apos;t expect you to be .
i &apos;m also sorry he kicks you in the head at night .
move back home if you want .
i love mason .
and i love you .
why ?
i &apos;ve got a kid .
and a husband who &apos;s suing for full custody
because i &apos;m an unfit mother .
which i probably am right now .
you &apos;re not an unfit mother .
you &apos;re a wonderful mom .
and a beautiful woman and that &apos;s why i love you .
you don &apos;t need all this .
i want it .
and we &apos;ll get through this .
okay ? trust me , no judge would give eddie
full custody of a ... hamster ,
let alone a child .
i promise .
well , sorry for a boring night .
company wasn &apos;t boring .
come here .
so ...
i don &apos;t know if , uh ...
if i should be careful
because of what happened to you ,
or if ...
like , there &apos;s things that don &apos;t feel good or ...
hey , thank you for asking .
but you don &apos;t have to .
i don &apos;t want you to treat me like a victim or whatever .
i don &apos;t .
okay .
&apos;cause rape isn &apos;t sex .
i know .
i just wanted to know if you need anything from me .
if i do , i will tell you .
okay .
so is that it ?
i just , uh ...
i know you &apos;re super callie ...
but this business with kyle , this is not your problem .
i know .
i just want you to take care of yourself .
i will .
i am .
okay , shouldn &apos;t they have called by now ?
well , these things take time .
is the judge , like , is he gonna make a decision today ?
honey , i don &apos;t know .
we were expecting your call . come in , come in .
we , uh , didn &apos;t want
to give you this news over the phone .
i &apos;m done .
i &apos;m off the list .
what ?
that is fantastic . that &apos;s such great news .
thank you . thank you .
the ada told me you called her .
thank you for putting in a word for me .
no problem .
