oh , yeah , baby .
oh , take it all !
oh , oh , no ,
you take it , baby .
no , baby , you take it all !
oh , no , you take it , baby .
no , baby , you take it !
dear god ,
will one of you just take it
and get it over with ?
max , there is no way you could be sleeping
through oleg and sophie .
does that actually work ?
it does ,
with a little help from this .
give me .
i was hoping that &apos;d be fruitier .
i mean , they &apos;re here .
they &apos;re there .
then , they &apos;re here again .
it &apos;s like we &apos;re a village under attack .
yup , just a matter of time
till someone sends in a drone .
and it &apos;s not just that moaning .
i think i heard a big ball rolling around up there .
if a ball is rolling around up there ,
oleg should stop and see a doctor .
this couldn &apos;t be any more intrusive .
sorry about that .
a bowling ball ?
and why do they need a bowling ball ?
maybe they ran out of holes .
have you guys seen a ball ?
pick up , max .
and sorry about the hole in your ceiling .
oleg , i &apos;m not even gonna ask you
to keep it in your pants anymore ,
but could you keep it in your apartment ?
oh , hey , sophie .
hey , max .
oh , spring is in the air .
this is the time of year in poland
when the snow would melt
and all our dead relatives
would float back to us .
i &apos;ve never been to europe ,
but it sounds beautiful .
max , where is caroline ?
and don &apos;t tell me she &apos;s in the ladies &apos; room ,
because i already peeked under all those stalls .
she wasn &apos;t there .
but i saw things .
well , congratulations on finally seeing those things .
she &apos;s 20 minutes late ,
and , as the boss , i will not have it .
wow , someone woke up on the wrong side of his crib .
you &apos;re late . this is unacceptable .
don &apos;t mind him .
he just saw his first vagina ,
and he &apos;s furious .
okay , here &apos;s the thing .
i had to take a nap
because oleg and sophie were having sex all night long .
not true .
we took a break to watch a porno .
punctuality
is the number one rule in my employee handbook ,
which i &apos;ve adorably named the han @-@ book .
relax , han .
nobody &apos;s gonna die
if i &apos;m not here to drop off a tuna melt .
in fact , they &apos;re more likely to die
if i do drop it off .
late , and with an attitude .
you think you &apos;re too good for the diner ?
of course she thinks that .
i think sourdough bread is too good for this diner .
well , what other career option do you have , caroline ?
hmm , let &apos;s see . cupcakes ?
no , wait , your shop didn &apos;t last six months .
don &apos;t go there , han .
oh , i &apos;m already there . and now i &apos;m back .
why so moody , han ?
are you man @-@ struating ?
is it that time of the man @-@ th ?
that shop was our dream , han ,
and this is just a dumb diner .
you &apos;re fired .
ooh ! i &apos;m fired ?
max , han just fired me .
you lucky son of a whore .
i &apos;m serious , caroline .
you called my diner &quot; dumb . &quot;
well , at least my diner &apos;s still open and successful ,
whereas your cupcake shop was so dumb , it failed .
ooh , he did not go there .
i went there , and then i came back ,
and then i went there again .
you know what ? i don &apos;t need this .
well , actually , you do kinda need this
&apos;cause we broke .
broke or not ,
i don &apos;t have to stand here and take this .
i quit .
oh , really ? you quit ?
you must be dumber than my diner
because i already fired you .
han , i know you &apos;ve had it up to here ,
but you need to relax .
can you believe han fired me ?
i mean , where does he get off ?
probably in buffy the vampire slayer chat rooms .
have you been standing here by the door this whole time ?
i didn &apos;t even pee .
i was afraid i &apos;d miss you .
so , hold on .
so , basically , you had the same day as a puppy ?
han &apos;s lucky i work there .
i bring class and sophistication to that place .
there &apos;s no toilet paper ,
and i just used the last coffee filter .
you are sophisticatin &apos; the hell
out of that toilet right now .
and you know what ?
you can tell han that the only way
i am ever going back there is if he apologizes .
okay , but first ,
he wanted me to tell you this .
the only way you &apos;re ever going back there
is if you apologize .
well , an apology from me is not happening .
oh , yeah , baby .
ooh , take it all .
oh , oh , no ,
you take it , baby .
oh , baby--
and that is not happening again tonight either .
again ?
that could &apos;ve hit us .
now , that &apos;s unsafe sex .
i think it &apos;s pretty neighborly of us
to return someone &apos;s sex bowling ball .
you know we have to bury those mitts now .
and we have to tell them to stop
whatever it is they &apos;re doing up here .
probably a 7 @-@ 10 split .
and now they &apos;re not making noise .
it &apos;s like when you go to the zoo ,
and the lion goes inside .
it &apos;s max and caroline .
your ball came into our yard again .
hi . yeah , it &apos;s not a good time .
uh , we &apos;re role @-@ playing ,
and , obviously , i &apos;m beyonce .
hey , jay z ?
look at all the single ladies .
oh , yeah , baby .
jay z and i have a lot in common .
he bought the brooklyn nets .
i bought my hairnets in brooklyn .
i &apos;m not surprised that you &apos;re jay z and beyonce ,
but i am kinda surprised that they bowl .
where should i put this ?
oh , well , i &apos;ll tell you what i told him .
put it anywhere you want .
so that &apos;s basically our ball at this point .
look , you two may be crazy in love ,
but your love is driving us crazy .
crazy in love ?
oh , come on . we &apos;re not in love .
oleg and i are just shtup buddies .
shtup buddies ?
i wouldn &apos;t say that &apos;s all we are .
oh , no , you &apos;re right .
we also share a cvs points reward card .
is it really a reward if it comes from cvs ?
can &apos;t you two ever do it over at oleg &apos;s apartment ?
or are all the lanes reserved ?
i have no idea where he lives .
wait , you &apos;ve never been to oleg &apos;s apartment ?
no , with my busy work schedule ,
i don &apos;t have the time to get
the battery of shots that i would need .
you &apos;d be surprised by my apartment , sophie .
it &apos;s more than just the place
the quadruple orgasm was born .
yeah , well , that sounds nice .
oh , yes . beyonc--
um , beyonce &apos;s hair just fell out .
i gotta go get my hot glue gun .
girls , i may have oversold my apartment .
what , by saying she won &apos;t need to get shots ?
yes .
maybe you two could help me fix it up a little ,
give it a feminine touch .
well , i &apos;m out .
you know what ? i &apos;ll do it .
but i &apos;m very recently out of work ,
so i &apos;m gonna have to charge you .
if you didn &apos;t , you &apos;d be the only girl
who ever went to his apartment without getting paid .
you got a deal .
oleg &apos;s apartment &apos;s this way .
i can smell the axe body spray .
i &apos;ll just throw a couple of these pillows around ,
and then we &apos;ll be gone .
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m walking up to oleg &apos;s apartment .
i always thought i &apos;d be dragged here unconscious
with electrical tape over my mouth .
afternoon , ladies .
this is where the magic happens .
well , i &apos;m sure you &apos;ve made some women disappear here .
okay .
just off the top of my head ,
i think we &apos;re gonna need a couple more pillows .
if you keep your apartment like this ,
do you get to pay 1980s rent prices ?
you haven &apos;t even seen the best part yet .
look .
goin &apos; up the stairway to heaven , baby .
oh , yeah . there it is .
that &apos;s my bed .
where are we ? studio 69 ?
that &apos;s 1,500 tracer bulbs .
i tore most of them out of the new cineplex 14 in queens .
first of all , i am smelling something
that can only be described as anti @-@ antiperspirant .
and , secondly ...
no woman wants to walk into this .
according to this ,
685 already have .
actually , it &apos;s 1,685 .
after a thousand , the counter resets .
look , if you don &apos;t want sophie to feel
like she &apos;s next in line at the dmv ...
more like the s @-@ t @-@ d @-@ mv .
then we have a lot of work to do .
okay .
make it look romantic .
when she comes in , i want her to feel special ,
like she &apos;s the only woman that &apos;s ever been here
today .
let &apos;s just sit down and talk about this .
oh , my god . max , is she dead ?
no . she &apos;s alexis .
you have one of those anatomically @-@ correct real dolls !
it &apos;s rare to see one without a short , fat man
standing next to it with a button penis .
they sell for $ 6,000,
but i got her for half off .
she was previously loved .
max , you are not doing that .
the hell i &apos;m not .
this is my one chance to see a woman naked
without having to spoon her after .
respect .
well , you &apos;ve made a lot of strong choices here ,
but i &apos;m not sure they &apos;re all working together .
for example , that sex swing is fighting the goat .
now , why don &apos;t we start by you going
and getting us some rubber gloves ?
lots of them ,
and the strongest bleach and soap products you can find .
oh , and a hazmat suit .
don &apos;t worry about the size . i can belt it .
but you &apos;re gonna keep my good stuff , right ?
if i see any , i &apos;ll consider it .
go .
what are you going to do with alexis ?
rehab , and then a women &apos;s shelter in montana .
go !
i &apos;ve got a lot of work to do .
but first ...
can not do it .
can not do it .
can you please turn that off , max ?
i &apos;m starting to feel a little dizzy ...
and i can &apos;t fall on the floor ,
&apos;cause i might stick to it .
you don &apos;t have to do this !
just call han and apologize ,
and we can get outta here
before the syphilis sets in .
no , he said some really hurtful things to me ,
and i &apos;d rather stay here
and work for oleg and alexis .
at least i &apos;ll have my dignity .
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
i have to go climb the sperm @-@ ship enterprise .
let me just get these curtains open
so i can see better .
seeing better ?
is that the way to go ?
i &apos;m walking on a water bed .
this is harder than it looks .
how many times has that been said on this bed ?
oh , my heel !
i swallowed !
i accidentally swallowed .
you know that &apos;s been said .
max , we got a problem .
see that girl ?
oh , what ? the usual drill ?
you hold her arms ,
and i punch her till she tips 20 % ?
as much as i enjoy that when we do it ,
no .
she &apos;s here to apply for caroline &apos;s job .
what ?
han &apos;s really going through with this ?
i thought it was all talk ,
like when a chihuahua barks at a big dog .
me too . i thought it would blow over .
you know , like han did in the wind that time ?
but , no , he is serious .
no way . i got this .
hi , is that your resume ?
let &apos;s take a little look @-@ see .
oh , you worked there ? cool .
yep . i &apos;m a very hard worker .
good . can you block a punch ?
&apos;cause the owner hits us .
he broke my femur . when i complained ,
he broke the other one .
run before he sees me talking to you .
earl , i gotta get han aand caroline to make up .
i don &apos;t have access to the pills i need
to keep working here without her .
any advice or pills ?
well , let &apos;s see . we are kind of like a family here ,
except i can see you unsupervised on the weekends .
and you didn &apos;t use my college fund
to buy a married man a corvette .
and in my family ,
when my kids would fight ,
i tried to get them to talk to each other ,
because honesty is key .
but if that didn &apos;t work ,
i &apos;d lie to their faces--
lock them in their room and tell them
that the other one had three weeks to live .
you know , what used to be known as good parenting .
max , i &apos;ve got 12 overqualified candidates
coming in for the waitress position today .
thank you , crumbling economy !
you know , han , here at this diner ,
we &apos;re kind of like a little family , and--
oh , i can &apos;t do this .
caroline has three weeks left to live .
i &apos;m serious .
she drank oleg &apos;s water bed .
it &apos;s just a matter of time .
nice try , max .
i &apos;m not going to give her back her job .
she should &apos;ve checked herself
before she wrecked herself .
come on . hire her back .
be the bigger man .
and note ,
i did not make a short joke ,
because this is important ,
and also because i &apos;m still working on something
with peter dinklage &apos;s name .
no way , max . i am holding firm .
you know , firm han is kinda hot .
he is ?
yeah .
i &apos;m kinda feeling firm han .
i have no interest in feeling the firm part ,
but i &apos;ll hang out with the rest .
you want to hang out with me ?
i &apos;m generally free mondays through fridays ,
mornings and evenings ,
and my weekends are wide open .
i may have a wedding to go to in june , but--
breathe .
come over tomorrow .
caroline will be at oleg &apos;s .
we can get stoned and watch a movie .
the last time i was stoned
was from a contact high i got at a concert .
well , those wiggle shows do get crazy .
look at us , max ,
hanging outside of work at your place
like a couple of homeys .
yeah , and where is my homey ?
oh , it &apos;s this way .
i can smell the axe body spray .
now , what movie should we watch ?
i brought shrek , shrek 2,
shrek 3 , shrek 3 @-@ d ,
and that cameron diaz cancer movie .
is there one where shrek has cancer ?
this is completely--
the same place i always live at .
max , it &apos;s so pretty .
i thought your place would have furniture
made out of razor blades or something .
i wish . that sounds bitchin &apos; .
what are you guys doing here ?
what is caroline doing here ?
you said she was going to be at oleg &apos;s .
i am at oleg &apos;s .
you guys live with oleg ?
you told him this was our apartment ?
as a wise person once told me ,
sometimes , you gotta lie to keep your family together .
i &apos;m not letting anyone leave
until you talk to each other .
i don &apos;t understand .
are we not smoking weed ?
oh , i already did .
i don &apos;t know what his problem is .
he fired me for missing 20 minutes of work .
why doesn &apos;t he fire himself for missing puberty ?
let it go , han .
she spent her morning dusting a strap @-@ on .
i didn &apos;t fire you because you were late .
i fired you because you crapped all over the diner ,
and you forgot that diner lifted you up
when you had nothing .
well , i lifted you up
when you couldn &apos;t reach the canned corn .
so , we &apos;re even . fight over .
what the hell did you do to my apartment ?
it looks like you could film
a douche commercial in here .
oleg , this is what you asked for :
romantic .
romantic ?
my place went from fifty shades of grey
to fifty shades of beige .
where &apos;s my sex swing ?
where &apos;s my sex chair ?
where &apos;s my poster that says ,
&quot; poke her in the front , lick her in the back &quot; ?
oleg , relax .
all your stuff &apos;s either in the basement or the closet .
and i think would know more about what a woman
would like to come home to
than a man whose last girlfriend
was made in the philippines .
it &apos;s me !
hide your kids !
hide your wife !
sophie !
she can &apos;t know you &apos;re here .
go , go , all of you .
han ! get in the closet !
putting a guy who &apos;s in the closet in the closet ?
that &apos;s like gay nesting dolls .
i &apos;m not gay .
i &apos;m a metrosexual .
this is where the magic happens ?
oh , no .
do you live with your mother ?
what ? you don &apos;t like ?
i thought you would enjoy the girl &apos;s touch .
what girls ?
the golden girls ?
sophie hates it .
i should &apos;ve just thrown a boiled ham on the bed .
oh , no .
my hair &apos;s stuck in oleg &apos;s clothes .
please don &apos;t let it be a pant zipper .
han , alexis .
alexis , han .
ew , take it away from me .
it &apos;s so heavy-- oh , no , oh , no .
help . get her off of me .
why ? you &apos;re finally getting some .
take it , take it .
i got it , i got it .
look ! han &apos;s fallen
and he can &apos;t get it up !
what the hell is going on here ?
i mean , this is freaky even for me .
sophie , i can explain .
i hired caroline to redo my apartment
so it wouldn &apos;t be the dirty bachelor pad
you were expecting .
but you are the dirty bachelor that i &apos;m expecting .
and why would you hire caroline ?
she doesn &apos;t know about sexy stuff .
she couldn &apos;t even figure out what we do
with the bowling ball .
sophie , you should &apos;ve seen what was in here .
i mean , he had this anatomically correct real doll
he named alexis .
yeah , well , she &apos;s very pretty .
he had a sex swing .
ooh , a sex swing .
what are you gonna tell me now ?
that he had a water bed ?
i did .
it had 1,500 tracer bulbs .
it was hot .
well , who has it now ?
i wanna be with him .
oh , hell , i &apos;m tired of all this role @-@ playing ,
so i &apos;m just going to say it .
sophie , i am in love with you .
well , i haven &apos;t said this to a man
in a very long time ,
but i like you a little bit .
i don &apos;t know what she &apos;s talking about , caroline .
i think it &apos;s pretty .
you make everything prettier ,
even the dumb diner .
your diner &apos;s not dumb .
i miss the diner .
and it misses you .
you can have your job back .
is it just &apos; cause i &apos;m stoned ,
or did anyone else feel that deep connection between them ?
could you all leave ?
i wanna be alone with oleg ...
and alexis .
now are we going to smoke weed ?
yeah , i &apos;m dying to see you high .
well , as high as you can get .
