honey , do you need me to move the car ?
no , it &apos;s nothing . i &apos;m alright
oh no ! iron cross , she &apos;s going down
oh god ! phil ...
you okay ?
yes . i am .
i am okay .
honey , why do we keep this car ?
it &apos;s a classic !
no , it just sits here .
and the seatbelts don &apos;t work .
the doors stick . it leaks fluids .
we haven &apos;t put fluids in it in 10 years .
well , i &apos;m gonna fix all that anyway .
and then , uh , it &apos;s gonna be haley &apos;s car .
oh , we &apos;re not giving this car to haley .
it &apos;s way too easy to fit a mattress in the back .
remember ?
oh , no . we &apos;re selling it .
what ? !
unless you don &apos;t think you can .
really ?
yeah .
seriously ?
you can &apos;t .
you honestly think that &apos;s gonna work ?
you can &apos;t sell it .
you know what ?
you can insult a lot of things about me ...
my hair , my voice , my balance @-@ board exercises ...
but don &apos;t insult my selling .
that crosses a line .
what line ? oh , you don &apos;t see it ?
that &apos;s &apos; cause i just sold it .
while the spray @-@ tanned starlet claims
to be six weeks sober , sources down under say :
she has been bar @-@ hopping
like a coked @-@ up kangaroo . &quot;
ah , what &apos;s daddy reading to you ?
if i have to read &quot; the very hungry caterpillar &quot;
one more time , i will snap .
oh , it &apos;s not that bad .
i will snap !
so , um , i laid the toolbox outside ,
and all the supplies are ready ,
and i think we are good to go !
terrific .
aren &apos;t you gonna change into a working man &apos;s outfit ?
no , i &apos;m good ,
and i don &apos;t think workmen really call them &quot; outfits . &quot;
we are building a princess castle for lily .
uh , it &apos;s something every father wants to be able to do for his daughter .
you know , and i fancy myself
as a bit of a castle designer .
i have done a few sketches .
which we have archived so we can use the kit .
mm , yeah .
the kit .
uh , the kit . which , uh , we &apos;re gonna do together .
i am petrified to do this with mitchell .
he built a couple of theater sets in college or something ,
and now he thinks he knows everything about building .
well , he doesn &apos;t .
every home @-@ improvement project that we &apos;ve undertaken .
has been a near @-@ death experience .
make the appetizers . and then we &apos;ll be ...
if an accident does happen , i hope he kills me ...
because i don &apos;t think i would be a very inspiring disabled person .
honey , relax .
she &apos;s not here yet .
you might want to play it a little cooler .
you don &apos;t want to scare off your girlfriend .
she &apos;s not my girlfriend !
she &apos;s just coming over to study the life cycle of silkworms .
oh . she &apos;s here .
she &apos;s here ! okay , how &apos;s my hair ?
i thought it was just a friend .
i heard that .
i wasn &apos;t whispering .
manny , open the door . make her feel welcome .
kelly ! good morning .
uh , i &apos;m glad you &apos;re here .
um , this is my mom .
nice to meet you !
in my culture ,
mothers are very clingy to their sons .
in fact , the leading cause of death among colombian women
is when their sons get married .
but i &apos;m not like that .
i just want my manny to be happy .
manny , why don &apos;t you give your friend kelly an empanada ?
oh , no , thank you .
i try to stay away from trans fats .
oh , i &apos;m sure one won &apos;t make a difference .
they &apos;re manny &apos;s favorite !
i ... think i &apos;m going to stop eating trans fats , too .
mom ? when was this from ?
oh ... that &apos;s the year your dad and i went to the rose bowl .
incredible game .
yeah .
mom , you look really pretty .
thank you , sweetheart .
so , what happened ?
well , lukey , everyone gets older .
just &apos; cause parts of your mom aren &apos;t what they used to be ,
it doesn &apos;t meam ...
i mean , what happened in the game ?
we got our butts kicked by penn state .
the parade was awesome , though .
angela lansbury was the grand marshal .
&quot; good time , &quot; she wrote .
okay , come on , guys . let &apos;s get back to it .
no one &apos;s gonna buy this heap looking this way .
hey , mom , which one is the garbage can ?
um , it ...
honey , you can &apos;t throw that away .
it &apos;s blankety .
it &apos;s disgusting .
no , sweetie , you loved blankety .
you wouldn &apos;t go anywhere without him .
yeah , until luke threw up on it .
yeah .
i used to throw up all the time .
remember buckety ?
oh , look at this .
what is that ?
we went to the beach one day ,
and luke had such a good time .
that he wanted to being home a jar of sunshine .
so he could always remember it .
do you remember , honey ?
oh , no ... no , no , don &apos;t ... don &apos;t open it .
you really think you trapped sunshine in there ?
i &apos;m just letting you know now ,
i &apos;m not taking care of him when you guys die .
stop . it &apos;s sweet .
still feels hot .
hey ! it &apos;s that guy who came by earlier .
he was really interested .
what was his name ? shoot !
well , you can &apos;t be in sales and not remember people &apos;s names .
that &apos;s why i like to use what they call &quot; minimonic &quot; devices .
they &apos;re little tricks to help you remember .
um , like the other day , i met this guy named carl .
now , i might forget that name ,
but he was wearing a grateful dead t @-@ shirt .
what &apos;s a band like the grateful dead ?
phish . where do fish live ?
&#91; 跟 &quot; 鱼 &quot; 读音相近 &#93;
the ocean .
what else lives in the ocean ?
coral .
hello , &quot; coral . &quot;
&#91; 他本想卖弄 却记错了 &#93;
i think it &apos;s &quot; mnemonic . &quot;
i ... i think i &apos;d remember .
okay .
you can do it , dad .
okay .
he looked like the drummer from foreigner .
now , foreigner &apos;s from france .
france rhymes with &quot; ants . &quot;
ants ruin a picnic .
what &apos;s up , nick ?
really ?
really ?
well , that &apos;s great .
yeah , no , swing by anytime . we &apos;re here all day .
thanks .
guess what ?
you said i couldn &apos;t sell this ?
well , you &apos;re gonna be eating a humble pie .
stuffed with crow and a big side of sorry ,
&apos;cause i just did .
in your face , girl with the negative tattoo !
honey ...
wait .
no !
whoa . someone doesn &apos;t like to lose .
honey .
honey !
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry .
when i woke up this morning , i hated that car ,
and even thinking about it made me mad .
but then when we were going through it ,
and blankety ...
all that stuff ... i just ...
the thought of that whole part of our life driving away ...
we can keep blankety .
i don &apos;t want ...
look at them .
come on . a minute ago , they were babies .
and now they &apos;re driving .
and soon we &apos;ll all be dead .
whoa ! you &apos;re leaving out a few great minutes there .
retirement , old age ...
cool chair that goes up the stairs .
yeah . i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m ... being ridiculous .
don &apos;t apologize . i love you when you &apos;re human .
listen .
hey ! listen !
we don &apos;t have to sell the car .
oh , sweetie , of course we do .
it doesn &apos;t make any sense to keep it .
well , what can i do to make you feel better ?
nothing .
unless you can build me a time machine .
honey ...
until someone can figure out how to keep a wormhole
from collapsing in on itself .
that &apos;s just a pipe dream .
sure .
phil ! come on back , phil .
well , i found the ...
i found the nail gun .
oh . yay .
the weirdest thing ... it was wrapped in an old towel
stuffed in a box on the top shelf of the closet .
well , just set it down on the counter .
heads up !
oh , dad , what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m , uh , just , uh , returning that crockpot that gloria borrowed .
oh , yeah , i forgot you had that crockpot , jay .
well , we &apos;re just getting ready to build lily a princess castle
if you ...
want to help ?
yeah , sure .
oh . well , if it &apos;s okay with you , mitchell .
oh , yeah ! oh , no , dad .
oh , remember how much fun we had
when we built that bookshelf together ?
that was my vietnam .
and i was in vietnam .
oh ! look at us !
three construction dudes !
dad , i &apos;m gonna get you some workman gloves .
i have a blue and camel .
what &apos;s your preference ?
surprise me .
wouldn &apos;t it be easier
if we had all our stuff in the same notebook ?
you think ?
i mean , we &apos;re always going back and forth .
i &apos;ll just put my things in your notebook .
okay .
who wants chocolate milk ?
sure , mom .
so how is it going ?
great !
kelly &apos;s moving her stuff
into my notebook .
this is sudden .
it just felt right .
oh , you know what you should do ?
put a pinch of salt in the chocolate milk .
it really brings out the flavor .
salt is for the popcorn .
that sounds good .
you wouldn &apos;t like it .
maybe we should let manny decide .
okay .
here &apos;s the salt .
we &apos;ll see what he likes .
wow !
that &apos;s really good !
try it , mom !
i don &apos;t care for it .
it was delicious .
i finally got lily down for a nap .
where is mitchell ?
he &apos;s not supposed to be unsupervised !
don &apos;t worry .
i got him in the garage putting flags on the spires .
okay , perfect .
it &apos;s better that way . nobody gets hurt .
we don &apos;t have to put flags on the spires .
yeah .
all right , let &apos;s get this roof on .
it &apos;s supposed to snap right into place .
hey !
whatcha got going on over there , jigsaw ?
well , i thought that i would get started
on the , uh , drawbridge while you guys worked on the roof , so ...
you all done with the flags ? !
yeah !
yeah , it took me like 15 minutes .
it was a lot easier than you made it out to be .
do something , jay .
uh , mitch ? !
yeah .
how about you make us some sandwiches ?
no . no , we &apos;re in the middle of this .
no , i think what jay &apos;s saying is ,
why don &apos;t you go sort some bolts ?
no , i sorted the bolts .
all of &apos; em ?
there were six .
w ... what &apos;s going on with you two ?
are you ... are you trying to get rid of me ?
uh ... , mitch .
oh , my god . you are .
you &apos;re ... you &apos;re , like , in cahoots .
mitchell , i get scared , when you &apos;re around tools ,
honey , it &apos;s dangerous ...
for me , for you ,
for ... our roses .
works better this way , kid .
i mean , castle goes right up ,
nobody gets sliced in half .
do you know how insulting this is ? i was ...
i was an intern at the songbird summer playhouse .
do you think that the town of brigadoon
just magically appeared ?
well , in the play , it did , but ... the set ...
the set was built with these two hands !
mitchell . mitchell ...
the von trapp mansion , evita &apos;s balcony ...
okay . okay .
oh , where are you going ?
i &apos;m going on a walk ,
and , oh , yeah , i can still do that by myself .
watch . oh , i hope i don &apos;t get hurt .
oh , god , who put that doorjamb there ?
i didn &apos;t see it .
i ran right into it .
oh , no , i tripped ! walking is so hard !
that one didn &apos;t look like it was on purpose .
it was !
just a few more steps .
oh , sorry !
step ! step ! sorry !
phil ? !
sorry , sorry .
it &apos;s gonna be worth it .
no , it &apos;s not .
don &apos;t listen to her .
and ...
ow . ow . ow !
sorry . don &apos;t struggle .
stop struggling .
great . it &apos;s our car .
not a car . kids ?
&quot; ti ... &quot; what ?
tonight , claire dunphy , we are turning back the clock
to a simpler time ...
when families piled into their station wagons ,
picked up some burgers ,
and went on a picnic up to granger point .
honey , we don &apos;t have to do this .
listen to her .
no , it &apos;s gonna be great . i talked to ...
france , ants , picnic ...
nick , and he &apos;s not picking up the car till tomorrow .
we have one more night of family fun !
what &apos;s gonna be fun about it ?
listen to him
only everything .
only nothing .
okay , kids , you know what ?
your father is trying to do something nice ,
so i would appreciate it if you would stop your whining
and just get in the car .
still does it !
oh , my !
come on , get in , get in !
i &apos;m just saying , the kid &apos;s gotta learn to let things go .
well , this is a touchy subject for mitchell .
he wants to feel like a regular joe , like you and i.
oh , pardonnez @-@ moi .
i prefer the champagne dijon to the standard yellow .
you know , there are a few areas that define us as men ,
like sports and construction .
mitchell just wants to feel like he &apos;s ...
part of the man club .
isn &apos;t that where you guys met ?
i know you &apos;re making a joke because you &apos;re uncomfortable ,
so i &apos;ll let it slide .
and we met at an orgy .
come on .
i just think it &apos;s crazy , that &apos;s all .
so what if he can &apos;t swing a hammer ?
look at all he has done .
law school , great career , providing for his family .
that &apos;s manly , too , isn &apos;t it ?
i mean , the classical sense .
well , yes , i mean , i think it also takes a big man
to quit his career as a music teacher
and raise a child .
you &apos;re a man , too , cam .
thank you , jay .
wait . garnish . we &apos;re men ...
not cavemen .
my great @-@ great @-@ grandfather
helped build the brooklyn bridge .
and i heard that , until the day he died ,
every time he passed it , he was filled with such pride .
he &apos;d say , &quot; there &apos;s a little bit of me in that bridge . &quot;
i know that i &apos;m not the handiest guy ,
but i &apos;m still a man ,
and i want to be able to look out into my yard and say ...
&quot; there &apos;s a little bit of me in that princess castle . &quot;
oh , no . no . no , no , no . no .
no . oh , no .
hey , mom .
kelly &apos;s parents are on their way .
she invited me to go out to dinner and a movie with them .
is that okay ?
oh , but ...
i thought that you and i were going to the movies tonight .
you know , to see that one with shia labeouf .
well , maybe we can go to the movie another night .
w ... what &apos;s wrong ?
oh , nothing .
just my heart .
okay , sue me .
i am a colombian mother .
i &apos;m not gonna let him make a mistake
that is gonna affect him for the rest of my life !
his life !
manny ,
i think we should talk about this kelly girl .
isn &apos;t she great ?
i think she really likes me .
why wouldn &apos;t she like you , baby ? of course .
go . have fun .
i &apos;m gonna wear my burgundy dinner jacket .
of course you are .
i say we apologize
and just finish the castle together like he wanted .
did you hide the nail gun ?
absolutely .
&apos;cause , i mean , you said that before .
no , i ...
oh , my gosh . it &apos;s finished .
what the hell ? mitchell did that ?
yes . yes , mitchell did it .
who &apos;s the bitch now , bitches ?
honey , it looks beautiful !
well , yeah , because when you two were inside
enjoying your little tea party , i was out here ...
out here getting stuff done .
i &apos;m sorry .
we shouldn &apos;t have underestimated you .
you know he &apos;s stuck in there , right ?
oh , yeah .
uh , hey , kid , cam and i are gonna go crack a couple cold ones .
you want to join us ?
no , no , you know what ?
i &apos;m just gonna stay here and get some stuff done ,
but you ... you two ladies enjoy your light beers .
how do you know we &apos;re having light beers ?
we only have light beers .
so , well , listen .
here is a hammer .
i don &apos;t need it . i don &apos;t need it , though .
and this is a screwdriver .
but i &apos;m not gonna use it .
and you just come on in whenever you want to .
i &apos;ll be in at ... yeah .
you sure we shouldn &apos;t get him out of there ?
no . he would never forgive us .
he &apos;s a very proud man , your son .
bird ! bird !
bird ! ah , oh , my god ! oh , my god !
yeah , i &apos;m pretty proud of myself right now .
ohh ! oh , my god !
calm down .
luke , honey , slow down .
no one &apos;s gonna take your food away .
wow , this place has really changed .
time marches on , huh ?
see that starbucks down there ?
you know what that used to be ?
an orange grove ?
no , a burger king .
you can still see some of the architecture .
thank you ... for this .
i really do feel better already .
you can go home again , claire .
oh , sweetie .
my stomach hurts .
luke , honey , i told you not to eat so fast .
just sit back , relax . you &apos;re gonna be fine .
ew ! spider !
haley !
haley !
haley , honey ,
you &apos;re standing on the back of daddy &apos;s seatbelt !
oh , soft cheeses , i can breathe again .
wait . where &apos;d the spider go ?
i really need some air .
okay , alex , lower your window .
i can &apos;t . it &apos;s stuck .
i forgot about that .
don &apos;t you throw up on me .
ohh . don &apos;t point him at me !
here , i &apos;ll turn on the ... haley ! !
oh ! oh , honey , i think that &apos;s the heat .
it &apos;s in my mouth .
it &apos;s happening !
okay , grab a bag !
oh , gosh , it smells like onions !
my seatbelt &apos;s stuck !
i &apos;ll help you .
oh , my god !
spider !
haley ! !
oh , god , he &apos;s gonna blow , mom !
i need buckety !
okay , everybody get out of the car !
our doors don &apos;t open !
we got ya .
slow is smooth , and smooth is fast !
get out , get out .
slow is smooth , and smooth is fast , dunphys !
nice and easy !
slow is smooth , and smooth is fast .
don &apos;t look at him !
he &apos;s just gonna make you feel sick !
oh , i looked , i looked , i looked .
oh , god .
guys , the car !
i got it !
oh , my god .
oh , my god ... no !
oh , no .
oh , no .
what &apos;s the plan , phil ? !
at least i &apos;m trying to do something !
dad , get off !
come on , phil !
let it go ! let it go !
oh , my god ! honey , let it go ! honey !
stop , stop , stop .
oh , no ! that &apos;s not ...
it &apos;s all right .
i &apos;m just ...
i &apos;m just being realistic ,
but we &apos;re gonna need to lower the asking price .
hi , papi .
you &apos;re here so soon .
i decided to skip the movie .
are you okay ?
yeah .
kelly didn &apos;t like my jacket .
plus , she ordered for me .
mm , did she let you hear the specials , at least ?
no . i don &apos;t want to be with someone who doesn &apos;t get me .
do we have any trans fats left ?
of course .
besides , i think there &apos;s a girl i &apos;d rather spend time with .
ohh , that &apos;s so sweet .
i &apos;m the luckiest mother in the world .
hey . this is manny . is alicia there ?
who &apos;s alicia ?
she &apos;s a girl in my history class .
we like to play &quot; six degrees of sir francis bacon . &quot;
you just tossed a woman aside .
immediately you go to the next one ? !
no , i just ...
just ... just what ? !
this is not the way you treat women !
men are all the same .
they break women &apos;s hearts , and they don &apos;t care !
men are all animals !
hey , honey .
animal !
the art of the sale is all about ...
what you leave out .
&quot; 83 classic wagon . &quot;
tough to find parts .
&quot; they don &apos;t make them like this anymore . &quot;
for legal reasons .
&quot; enjoyed for many years by one happy family . &quot;
of raccoons .
i &apos;m kidding . actually ...
actually , it did make us happy for a long time .
it &apos;s gonna be tough to say goodbye .
it always is .
nobody loves change .
but ...
part of life is learning to let things go .
i totally thought i was gonna puke on you .
i would have killed you if you did .
oh , yeah , like you killed that spider ?
oh , you didn &apos;t see it . it was huge .
remember the look on mom &apos;s face
when her seat fell down ?
how about when dad jumped on the hood of the car ?
&quot; what &apos;s the plan , phil ? ! &quot;
mitch ? lily ?
hey , we &apos;re in here !
princess is in her castle !
how long have you guys been out here ?
ohh . cam , she can &apos;t get enough .
we &apos;ve been in here for like two hours .
and we did this for her .
need me to get you out of there ?
this thing is not safe , cam .
move to the back of the castle .
yeah , no . i know the drill .
no , don &apos;t carry me out this time .
i think it sends the wrong message to lily .
