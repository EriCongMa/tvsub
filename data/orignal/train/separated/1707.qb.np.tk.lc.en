and reverse the spin on the antiproton ...
and γ becomes α ...
multiplied by a matrix of ( -i , 0 ) ...
and there we have it .
conclusive proof that i am absolutely worthless after 9 o &apos;clock .
sheldon ...
sheldon ...
all right , all right .
i see what &apos;s going on .
a little pre @-@ halloween hijinkery .
a ghostly moan ,
a rattling of chains ,
a witch &apos;s cackle .
the trifecta of haunted house cliche .
instead of &quot; eek , &quot; i say , &quot; yawn . &quot;
sheldon ...
oh , the walls are dripping blood ,
which looks nothing like a phenolphthalein indicator
exposed to a sodium carbonate solution .
&quot; see you in hell sheldon . &quot;
the most frightening thing about that is the missing comma .
okay , all right .
that one was clever .
skeleton with phosphorous on a zip line .
come on out , merry pranksters .
take a bow .
you should &apos;ve seen your face .
yes , there &apos;s nothing quite like the slightly widened eyes
of mildly startled .
come on , admit it .
we got you , sheldon .
please , fright depends on an element of surprise .
the simple fact is ,
because i am much smarter than you ,
and able to anticipate your actions ,
it is highly unlikely that you two rubes
could ever surprise me .
he &apos;s probably right .
we can &apos;t beat him . he &apos;s just too smart .
gentlemen .
who had money on &quot; faints &quot; ?
i had &quot; pee his pants . &quot;
hang on .
looks like everyone &apos;s a winner .
oh . watch out , sheldon .
this little boy casper is a g @-@ g @-@ g @-@ ghost !
droll .
not as droll as a grown man
passed out in a puddle of his own urine .
that was pretty droll .
with a hint of ammonia .
yes , enjoy your japes , gentlemen .
you think you &apos;ve poked fun at a milquetoast academic .
well , you &apos;ve forgotten one thing :
i am also a son of the lone star state .
i &apos;m texas through and through .
and we know how to settle scores down there .
if you doubt me , ask mexico .
hot girl , nine o &apos;clock .
don &apos;t everybody look at once !
what is she doing in a comic book store ?
i don &apos;t know , she might be lost .
doesn &apos;t matter . watch and learn .
hi .
hi .
... it @-@ it @-@ it ...
shut up .
are you getting this next men ?
uh , yeah . it &apos;s issue number 21 .
first appearance of hellboy .
i know . i &apos;ve been looking for it for years .
sorry .
hey , if i pretended to hit on you ,
could i distract you enough to sneak it away ?
yes , but you &apos;d be using your superpowers for evil .
damn , i &apos;m forbidden by my kryptonian father to do so .
i &apos;m alice .
leonard .
you &apos;re very cute , leonard .
thanks . you , too .
you know , go ahead and take it .
no , no . no , no , i @-@ i did evil .
would you be open to a trade ?
yeah , yeah , sure , i guess .
okay . here .
this is my number .
call me .
sorry , palm &apos;s a little sweaty .
what &apos;s that word ?
alice .
oh , right , your name .
that makes more sense than &quot; penis . &quot;
later .
did we just see you pick up a girl in a comic book store ?
&apos;cause if you did , you get your picture up there
on the wall of heroes .
no , i don &apos;t think i picked her up .
besides , i have a girlfriend .
doesn &apos;t matter . this is the closest anyone &apos;s ever come .
you &apos;re going on the wall , my friend .
be sure to check the mail .
how many times are you gonna tell me ?
what &apos;s with you ?
nothing .
it &apos;s not suspicious that i &apos;m fixating .
it &apos;s consistent with my personality .
right .
hey , guys .
more halloween candy ?
didn &apos;t you just buy a bunch of it yesterday ?
oh . yeah . that &apos;s gone .
it &apos;s a rough month when halloween and pms
hit at the same time .
leonard doesn &apos;t have time to chat ,
he has to get the mail .
will you relax ? i &apos;ll get it in a minute .
how was work ?
open the mail !
excuse me .
a couple of circulars , nothing important .
what &apos;s with him ?
hang on .
you might be from texas , but i &apos;m from new jersey .
check it out .
jim lee drew this of me two years ago at comic con.
what are you wearing ?
well , you know , it &apos;s comic con.
i &apos;m lion @-@ o from thundercats .
wow , you must have gotten so laid .
no . but jessica alba did rub my furry belly .
want to see a comic i draw ?
you &apos;re kidding . you have your own book ?
yeah . it &apos;s kinda based on my life .
cool .
oh , look . that &apos;s you having sex with a guy
in the top half of a chewbacca costume .
comic con ?
you &apos;d think , but no .
you &apos;re very talented . this is really good .
did you do ...
so , can i trade you my comic for the hellboy ?
you can have my car .
oh , dear .
oh , dear ...
oh , dear , oh , dear , oh , dear ...
oh , dear , oh , dear , oh , dear .
purell , purell , purell , purell .
good morning , sheldon .
it is , isn &apos;t it ?
oh , bother .
isn &apos;t that just always the way ?
you go to staple something , and you &apos;re out of staples .
gosh , i wish i &apos;d known that earlier today
when i was at staples .
you ever think of paper clips right there ?
no , no , i need something more permanent to join these papers .
say , don &apos;t you keep staples in your top desk drawer ?
i don &apos;t know . maybe .
be a lamb and check .
all right .
who do we have here ?
it &apos;s a snake . a terrifying snake .
oh , did some bad man put us in a drawer ?
stop talking like that .
you &apos;ve been rendered speechless by fear .
let &apos;s go to the biology lab
and find you some nice yummy mice .
i tried to scare an indian with a snake .
come on , cooper . you &apos;re better than this .
it &apos;s open .
hey , you got a minute ?
yeah , sure , come on in .
thanks .
want some mac and cheese ?
no . lactose . gas .
glass of wine ?
no . sulfites . migraines .
okay , well , i &apos;d offer you halloween candy ,
but that &apos;s gone .
so , what &apos;s up ?
okay , we used to go out , right ?
oh , my god , that &apos;s where i know you from .
i &apos;m dealing with a situation
and it &apos;s kind of about my love life ,
so i know that might be weird for us to talk about ,
but in this area , as you know ,
all my other friends are just so stupid .
all right , what &apos;s going on ?
so , you &apos;re okay talking about this ?
yes .
you &apos;re sure it &apos;s not weird .
it &apos;s okay .
you know what , if you ever want to talk to me
about a problem in your life with a guy ,
then i would be fine with that .
okay , good , because there &apos;s this one guy i used to date
who &apos;s about to be force @-@ fed wine and cheese
if he doesn &apos;t get to the point .
okay ,
here it is .
is it cheating if a guy has a girlfriend ...
yeah , probably .
come on .
i &apos;m sorry , go ahead .
i met this girl , and she &apos;s great .
we have a lot in common .
did you guys do it ?
no . we just made out a little .
oh , look at you , you bad boy .
did you tell her about priya ?
well , i was gonna , but there were too many tongues in my mouth .
that &apos;s gross .
here &apos;s the thing ,
i @-@ i &apos;m not one of those guys who sneaks around
and sleeps with more than one woman .
well , good for you .
the problem is , i want to be one of those guys .
so sleep with the new girl and lie to priya .
oh , that &apos;s not who i am .
all right , then break it off with the new girl .
now , let &apos;s not do anything rash .
she &apos;s really hot .
if you like this girl so much ,
why don &apos;t you just end things with priya ?
priya and i are in love .
i think we could get married someday .
leonard , you &apos;re looking for a way to sleep with both women
and have everybody be happy about it .
now we &apos;re getting somewhere .
what does your gut tell you ?
&quot; go ask penny ; she &apos;ll know what to do . &quot;
hello , howard .
i &apos;ve realized that you scaring me was all in jest .
allow me to say , job well done .
perfect .
what are you doing ?
science . you wouldn &apos;t understand .
hey , well , see you . i &apos;m going out .
i thought you were leaving the apartment .
yeah , me , too . i can &apos;t make up my mind .
are you concerned because the world is filled
with big dogs and bullies ?
no . i &apos;m having a moral crisis .
well , if it &apos;s of any help ,
i &apos;ve read all the great moral philosophers ,
including dr. seuss .
oh , what the hell .
i &apos;m supposed to go see that girl
from the comic book store , alice ,
but i don &apos;t know if i should ,
because i &apos;m going out with priya ,
but she &apos;s in india .
all right . so the topic at hand is sexual fidelity .
probably won &apos;t be relying on seuss here .
although &lt; i &gt; one fish , two fish , red fish , blue fish &lt; / i &gt;
might be surprisingly applicable .
go on .
well ...
they say at the end of your life ,
you regret the stuff you didn &apos;t do
more than the stuff that you did ,
and i &apos;m pretty sure alice is the stuff i want to do .
you know , the german philosopher , friedrich nietzsche ,
believed that morality is just a fiction
used by the herd of inferior human beings
to hold back the few superior men .
that actually does help .
it &apos;s worth noting that he died of syphilis .
screw it , i &apos;m going .
on your way home ,
will you pick up some orange juice ?
do you mind ?
i &apos;m questioning a lot of things in my life right now .
is one of those things your fondness for orange juice ?
no .
great . tropicana , no pulp .
hey , sheldon .
who is it !
it &apos;s me , sheldon , mrs. wolowitz .
that &apos;s not my mom , it &apos;s bernadette .
really ? that &apos;s very unsettling .
hi , sheldon .
hi .
what &apos;s up ?
it just occurred to me that i never formally congratulated you
on your pending nuptials .
so i hopped on
the first bus and hightailed it down here to shake your hand .
put &apos; er there , you old so @-@ and @-@ so .
well , i @-@ i &apos;m gonna see you at work in ... 12 hours
don &apos;t you think it could have waited until then ?
holy smoke , why didn &apos;t i think of that ?
you &apos;re a better man than i , howard wolowitz .
you put &apos; er there , you son of a gun !
whatever .
my ... oh ...
it &apos;s ...
oh , my god , howard !
what did you do ?
it was a harmless halloween prank . look .
howard has a heart condition ! you know that !
well , i thought he made that up .
i @-@ isn &apos;t hypochondria
a common idiosyncrasy of jewish people ?
this is adrenaline --
we &apos;re gonna have to inject it into his heart .
we are ?
you are .
i &apos;m not strong enough to get it through his chest plate ,
and we &apos;ve only got one shot .
oh , no ! i can &apos;t !
hurry !
we &apos;re running out of time !
okay .
just do it !
oh , god !
one ... two ...
three !
trick or treat , bubbeleh .
what ?
no . you mean this was all a ruse ?
oh , how could i be so stu ...
damn it , i can &apos;t .
i can &apos;t do this .
uh , is it my tongue stud ?
&apos;cause if that freaks you out ,
you &apos;re in for a real surprise later on .
no , no , no .
i @-@ i can &apos;t do this .
believe me , i really want to .
but ... ?
but i kind of have a girlfriend .
are you kidding ?
you &apos;re cool with you and me just being friends , right ?
i don &apos;t believe this .
wait , i don &apos;t ... which part ?
i &apos;m so stupid .
i thought for once i &apos;d met a good guy ,
but you &apos;re just another jackass .
oh , no , no , you have it wrong .
no . i @-@ i was going to be a jackass ,
but i stopped myself .
i stayed a good guy , so ...
i &apos;m gonna pass on the sex .
but you should know , that &apos;s not a comment on your hotness
but on my goodness .
that &apos;s kind of my superpower .
i &apos;m , like , captain good guy .
it &apos;s okay .
did the right thing .
you idiot !
hey , priya .
hey , sweetheart . how &apos;s it going ?
uh , not so good .
we have to talk .
oh , sounds serious . what &apos;s up ?
okay , uh ... here it is .
i met this girl and i kissed her ,
and i feel terrible about it .
but it &apos;s done , it &apos;s never gonna happen again .
and i am so , so sorry .
leonard , relax .
it &apos;s okay .
it is ?
yeah , these things happen .
they happen to everybody .
oh , my god , you are amazing .
i mean , i don &apos;t deserve you .
wh @-@ what do you mean &quot; everybody &quot; ?
leonard , i didn &apos;t know if i should tell you ,
but i kind of cheated on you , too .
kind of ?
a couple of weeks ago ,
i slept with my ex @-@ boyfriend .
so , i guess we both messed up a little .
no , no , i messed up a little . you messed up a lot .
well , it &apos;s not a competition .
oh ... yeah , it is , and you won .
i @-@ i @-@ i &apos;m sorry , i have to go .
i don &apos;t believe this .
