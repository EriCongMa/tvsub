hey , kono , can i ask you something ?
sure .
were you bummed when jenny shaun beat you in the finals
for the junior nationals ?
ho , little one , you cut to the bone , huh ?
yeah , i was pretty bummed .
but then you came back and beat her at the u.s. open .
now , that was fun .
suzie ! come on !
i got to go .
good job .
how long have you known suzie ?
five years .
they diagnosed her with cystic fibrosis
when she was six months old .
and now she &apos;s surfing .
and being in the saltwater mist , where she can breathe better ,
is the best medicine for her .
yeah .
thanks for helping out with my charity , kono .
thanks for inviting me .
i can &apos;t think of a better way to spend my day off .
you gotta go ?
sorry .
hey , remind suzie to practice
her pop @-@ up in the hotel room .
you got it .
thanks .
cheers , kawika .
hey , kono .
hey .
all right , so our vic &apos;s name is renny sinclair .
he &apos;s a big @-@ time photographer .
he &apos;s was in oahu for three days shooting a swimsuit spread .
according to witnesses , renny was inside his trailer
when it caught fire , and then exploded .
i &apos;m thinking incendiary device .
why do you think it was murder and not an accident ?
oh , well , if you &apos;ll follow me here , to exhibit &quot; a ... &quot;
we have a 13 mill steel shackle lock .
the firemen had to cut the door handle off to get it open .
once someone slapped that on ,
renny never stood a chance of getting out .
you guys got to see this .
this might be where our killer &apos;s inspiration came from .
&quot; worship me &quot; ?
what is this , life imitating art ?
let me tell you something ,
anybody who burns somebody alive ,
and makes him suffer the way he suffered ...
this was personal .
okay , kono , stick with the crime techs
and finish processing the scene .
chin . you , me and danny
are going to go talk to some witnesses .
we &apos;ll start with renny &apos;s closest associates first .
i &apos;m going to talk to these models .
okay , just stay with questions that relate to the case , all right ?
what is that supposed to mean ?
what it means is i know you .
i &apos;m just saying stick to the case .
hey . hey . they &apos;re just women .
who happen to be insanely hot and make millions of dollars .
i didn &apos;t know either of those things .
you are so busted .
are you kidding me ?
go !
go ! get off of me !
leave him alone ! you shouldn &apos;t even be here ! whoa !
get off !
go !
she did it . she killed him .
he didn &apos;t love her anymore , so she killed him .
you are an insane person . stay away from me .
stay away from me .
what do you got there ?
i wanted her to see what she did .
she didn &apos;t just take renny away from me ,
she took him away from his child .
all right , just a moment .
danny , come here . you come with me .
come on . you all right ?
she &apos;s insane .
what makes you think jordan killed renny ?
she was , uh ...
she was jealous of renny and me .
do you still love renny ?
what does that have to do with anything ?
well , it &apos;s relevant . i mean you guys were a couple , right ?
six months ago .
okay , well , he and alana were about to have a baby .
they were going to get married .
obviously it kills any chance
of reconciliation for you guys , right ?
i was over renny .
jordan wasn &apos;t over him .
after renny broke up with her , she totally lost it .
fell apart . i mean ,
i don &apos;t think she ever really recovered .
after we broke up ,
i wished him well , and i never looked back .
if he wanted to be with alana ,
i wasn &apos;t going to stand in the way of that .
she couldn &apos;t stand seeing us together .
seeing us happy .
why would i have taken this job if i wasn &apos;t over him ?
if i was to turn down every job
because of past relationships with photographers ,
i wouldn &apos;t have a career in this industry .
i know this may sound corny ,
but renny was everything to me .
i don &apos;t know where i go from here .
you go home ,
you grieve , you get strong .
everyone knew jordan still had a thing for renny ,
but she was a complete pro during the shoot .
where was she before the fire started ?
uh , she was supposed to be in the changing tent ,
but i was running around getting ready for the next set up ,
so i can &apos;t tell you for sure .
what about the other models ? how &apos;d they get along with renny ?
from what i can tell , everyone loved renny .
how long have you been working with him ?
um , tomorrow will be a week .
i was a local hire .
to be honest ,
i don &apos;t even know most of these people &apos;s names .
was there anyone on set today who wasn &apos;t here working ?
any visitors ? anyone hanging around
the trailer who wasn &apos;t supposed to be ?
there was this guy .
he drove a silver porsche .
i only remember because renny told me
to make sure he was allowed to drive on
and park next to his trailer .
did you get a name or a license plate number ?
i was just told to look out
for a friend of his driving a silver porsche .
i waved him on the set and that was it .
i never even saw what he looked like .
excuse me .
uh , charlie fong ?
i &apos;m officer ...
kono . how are you ?
i &apos;m ... good .
that &apos;s great . it &apos;s really good to see you again .
i &apos;m sorry . do i ... ?
do we know each other ?
i knew you wouldn &apos;t remember .
okay .
let &apos;s get started .
i pulled the data that you sent over
from the renny sinclair crime scene
and put together a little reenactment .
here we have the two gas cans
that you collected as evidence .
one was placed on the exterior ,
underneath your victim &apos;s trailer ,
and the other was placed on the interior ,
under the bathroom sink .
we never worked a case together .
no , we haven &apos;t .
as i was saying-- once the exterior frame caught fire ,
the flames set off this second gas can ,
immediately engulfing the interior of the trailer .
all right . were you able to analyze
the gas sample we recovered ?
i &apos;m running it through gcms now .
if it &apos;s a viable sample , it &apos;ll tell us
what station this gas was purchased at .
very cool .
yeah . it &apos;s amazing .
chemically speaking .
all right , so what else do we know ?
found something inside your melted gas can .
what is all that ?
can &apos;t see what it is from the x @-@ ray ,
so i &apos;m having one of the other techs
take it to an industrial oven .
the only way to extract it
is to carefully melt away the plastic .
did you graduate from kukui high ?
nope . punahou .
you &apos;re not going to make this easy , are you ?
just the crime solving stuff .
yeah . yeah ,
i got it . 3 : 00 .
i &apos;ll be there .
yeah .
what &apos;s going on ?
that was i.a.
they want to see me this afternoon at 3 : 00 .
your uncle talked to them , didn &apos;t he ?
he told them it wasn &apos;t me .
and he told them my auntie
was dying and needed a new kidney ,
so he stole the $ 200,000 out of the asset forfeiture locker
to save her life . and now , of course ,
i.a. officially reopens the case .
look , chin , listen , this is going to clear your name .
yeah , it will .
but at what cost ?
my uncle was a righteous cop , steve .
in his 25 years , he put away hundreds of criminals--
guys that deserved to be off the street .
and if he &apos;s found guilty , they &apos;ll enact judicial review .
all of his past convictions can be called into question .
guilty men will walk straight out of prison .
so let me call the governor .
no .
it &apos;s my problem .
i &apos;ll handle it .
what &apos;s with him ?
his uncle &apos;s about to be arrested .
what did he do ? he told the truth ?
yeah .
chin &apos;s been carrying this secret for so long ,
he &apos;d rather keep living with it than see his uncle go to jail .
where have you been anyway ?
well , i have been doing my job .
okay , i thoroughly questioned all the models
on renny &apos;s photo shoot this morning .
i bet you did .
get your mind out of the gutter , okay ?
i was strictly business .
okay , turns out
all the ladies say the same thing--
jordan and alana were both
in the changing tent at the time of the fire .
so jordan didn &apos;t do it ?
what &apos;d i just say ?
i mean , unless she can teleport her body , no ,
she didn &apos;t do it .
so we got no suspects on this ?
hold on . relax . okay ?
i had hpd run renny &apos;s financials and his phone records .
look at this . guy &apos;s like a 15 @-@ year @-@ old girl .
all text messages , no phone calls .
why is a fashion photographer sending coded texts ?
all right . you know what ?
i &apos;m going to send this to catherine .
she can have the , uh , the boys in intel
run it through ...
what ? it &apos;s not coded texts .
okay ? no need for your little ramboette .
okay , this is not your , uh , cloak @-@ and @-@ dagger spook speak .
this is danny &apos;s world . oh ?
these are bets .
bets ?
what are you talking about , bets ?
yeah .
guy had action all over the place .
bos minus eight-- that &apos;s boston celtics , minus eight points .
nyk , 2.5-- that &apos;s the knicks
minus two and a half points .
check you out .
guy was an animal .
bets all over the place .
what else you got ?
i &apos;ll show you . look at this .
guy &apos;s got open credit markers all over vegas .
mandalay , caesars , bellagio .
look at the bank records .
every dollar that comes in goes straight back out again .
he &apos;s a cash poor kind of guy .
yeah , strapped for cash , but he &apos;s still banking bets , right ?
so , if he can &apos;t come up with the dough , what does that mean ?
it means he &apos;s burning his bookie .
yeah , then maybe the bookie did the same thing to him .
chin .
i knew you &apos;d be here .
why is that ?
&apos;cause of all the fishing spots you know ,
you never once caught anything here worth keeping .
i figured you &apos;re here more to think than to fish .
you shouldn &apos;t have come here .
since i.a. opened this investigation ,
you &apos;re in violation
of a department mandate if you have contact with me .
uncle , i.a. called me .
i have to appear before a review board this afternoon .
that &apos;s good .
tell them the truth .
the truth doesn &apos;t matter anymore .
what matters now is keeping you out of jail .
you don &apos;t have to be silent any longer , chin .
you owe me nothing .
i owe you everything .
i need you to go back to i.a.
and tell them that since auntie died ,
you haven &apos;t been thinking clearly .
chin ...
that you didn &apos;t know what you were saying .
i need you to go back
and tell them that i took the money .
i &apos;m not telling them that .
telling them that could put you in jail .
i &apos;m not lying anymore .
gcms findings
are back on the gas our killer used to start the fire .
he bought 87 octane .
that doesn &apos;t help us .
87 is the most widely used octane of gas ,
but the additives are a match to a local chain--
lex brodie &apos;s gas .
how many stations are there on the island ?
twelve .
so all we have to do is match this gas sediment fingerprint
to a specific lex brodie station ,
and we know where our killer bought the gas .
exactly .
what are you so happy about ?
we now have to collect samples from 12 different stations .
that &apos;s cool . i need gas anyway .
cool tech .
you &apos;re not the only nerd on the block .
let &apos;s roll .
i think i just found that mystery guest
who paid a visit to our vic this morning .
witness i spoke to said he was driving a silver porsche ,
right ?
right .
i pulled this off a traffic cam near the crime scene .
time code places it on the road right around t.o.d.
perfect . you run the plates ?
comes right back to a shell corporation .
it &apos;s just the kind of move you &apos;d expect from ...
derek marcum .
you know him ?
yeah .
i busted him years back when he was small @-@ time .
now he &apos;s major league .
actually , he runs most of the betting action on the island .
oh , he &apos;s a bookie , huh ?
mm @-@ hmm . i wonder if marcum was taking bets from our vic .
oh , we have evidence that says renny had a gambling problem .
how do we find this guy ?
you don &apos;t .
from what i hear , he &apos;s by referral only .
okay , we just have to find somebody
who can give us an introduction .
okay , so , all the bets
were texted to marcum &apos;s prepaid cell .
i took the numbers and made a client list .
okay , good . we just get one of marcum &apos;s clients to give him up .
yeah , i got the perfect guy . real whale .
oh , yeah , a high stakes gambler ?
no , he &apos;s literally a whale .
i &apos;m paying you for your energy
and your passion .
come on !
you got to feel the shave ice ,
you got to be the shave ice .
come on , supersize that thing .
come on !
it &apos;s 120 in here , and i &apos;m gonna pass out .
you like pass out before or after i pay you ?
hey .
hey , my haole brothers from another mother .
how you doing ?
howzit ?
what &apos;s with the muppet ?
that &apos;s an economic stimulator .
brah , this is hawaii .
shave ice everywhere .
saturated market .
it &apos;s all about distinguishing your product ,
maximizing your brand awareness .
well , if you wanted more cash ,
maybe you shouldn &apos;t have taken northwestern last week .
oh , me ? no . i don &apos;t gamble for money , bro .
i &apos;m afraid that &apos;s not true .
we know you have an open account with marcum .
no , no , no , never . never do that .
oh , i believe you .
look , this is what i &apos;m gonna do .
i got this number off of marcum &apos;s phone records .
i &apos;m gonna call it right now ,
and , uh , i don &apos;t know ,
we &apos;ll see whose phone rings .
you gonna get that ?
grandma .
hi , dear .
okay , look ,
i don &apos;t do this a lot ,
and i &apos;m only down a little .
no , no , you &apos;re not down a little .
you have not won a bet in six months .
okay , you are the worst gambler of all time .
i tried . that &apos;s all i can do .
kamekona , listen , we need to find marcum , okay ?
that &apos;s a tough bugger to find .
okay , well , that @-@ that bugger
is a suspect in a murder investigation .
and i never seen him .
okay , but you owe him money , right ?
so does everybody else who gambles .
okay , fine .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re gonna call his people .
you &apos;re gonna tell them that you &apos;re not gonna pay
any of the money back , not a cent ,
and if they got a problem with that , they know where you work .
no , i can &apos;t do that . i got to pay &apos; em .
you don &apos;t understand .
these are big , scary guys .
big scary guys , huh ?
this is kame .
uh , yeah , i forgot .
three , two , four , four .
yeah .
if you want the money that i owe you ,
you &apos;re going to have to come here
and take it from me ,
because i am not paying .
that &apos;s it . lesson learned .
if i live through this , i &apos;m never gambling again .
yeah , right .
how much you like to bet ?
all right , last one .
let &apos;s go .
hey , boss .
hey , kono , you finish collecting
those gas samples yet ?
yeah . we just got the last one .
we &apos;re heading back to the lab now to see if we can land a match .
okay , fine . listen , we think
we may have a suspect that we want to move on , okay ,
but we &apos;re gonna need some evidence first .
so , let me know when you get something .
copy that .
no pressure .
why don &apos;t you put on some tunes .
that always dials down the pressure .
yeah . that &apos;s a good idea .
looking for your boyz ii men ?
i haven &apos;t listened to them since i was ten years old .
&quot; on bended knee &quot; was your favorite .
camp waimea .
that &apos;s where i knew you from .
keep trying .
so , kamekona ,
what &apos;s this about you not wanting to pay marcum ?
you play dumb ?
answer me .
you like getting lickins ?
i &apos;m sorry .
i just overheard-- did you say &quot; lickings &quot; ?
you know how difficult it is to sound
like a tough guy when you use a word like &quot; lickings &quot; ?
you should try &quot; beatings . &quot; like , &quot; i &apos;m gonna give you a beating . &quot;
it works , trust me , on a lot of different levels .
five @-@ o , guys .
let &apos;s go take a seat ,
keep your hands where we can see &apos; em .
let &apos;s have a little chat about what &apos;s going on .
cool . all right .
danny .
i got him .
let me ask you a question :
what part of &quot; sit down and chat &quot; did you not understand , huh ?
open the door .
stay there , stay there .
all right , come on .
go through . go .
let &apos;s go , everybody up . up , up , up , up , up right now .
into the office .
let &apos;s go , huddle , huddle , huddle .
all right ,
nice , huddle up the back there ,
keep each other warm with your bodies ,
take a seat on the floor .
very good .
now , take a seat .
derek marcum ,
keep your hands where i can see them .
that way everybody gets to go home
at the end of the day , all right ?
gentlemen , i take it you &apos;re part
of honolulu &apos;s law enforcement community .
what , uh ...
what gave us away ?
you &apos;re wearing a tie in hawaii .
do us a favor , take a seat .
i want to ask you a couple questions .
so what &apos;s this about ?
this is about renny sinclair .
we have you on camera leaving a photo shoot
right after renny was killed .
renny &apos;s dead ? what happened ?
well , what i think happened
is that he owes you a gambling debt
and you couldn &apos;t come up with the dough , so you killed him .
i didn &apos;t kill him .
renny was a friend .
i don &apos;t use that word lightly .
okay , all right , but just so i understand ,
he did owe you money , right , and you obviously wanted it .
hypothetically speaking ,
if i were involved in illegal bookmaking ,
i wouldn &apos;t kill a client .
dead clients tend to have trouble clearing debts .
he &apos;s got a point .
that being said , in this hypothetical situation ,
no , renny did not owe me a gambling debt .
okay , so what were you doing at the photo shoot ?
i &apos;m in a cash business , gentlemen .
sometimes that leaves me with a reserve .
from time to time i lend that reserve out for a profit .
renny came to me ,
he asked to borrow some money , i gave it to him .
how much ?
$ 291,570 .
that &apos;s a very specific amount .
did he tell you what it was for ?
you know , banks ask those kind
of questions of their clients ; i don &apos;t .
what &apos;s that ?
that &apos;s how he was going to repay me .
he signed over the first 400 large of his book &apos;s profits to me .
renny mints cash with these things .
okay .
if this contract is legit ...
... then that helps your cause .
but if it &apos;s not , that proves to us that you did not want
renny alive to dispute your claims .
in the meantime , let me see your hands .
we &apos;re changing venues .
for what , gambling ,
lending money ?
you do realize i &apos;m gonna post bail
and be out in a few hours ?
yeah , that &apos;s true , but it &apos;ll give us a little time to decide
if we &apos;re going to extend your stay for murder .
hey , don &apos;t tell anyone ,
but i think i might have become a town girl .
you know those south swells at bowls ?
you ever paddled out there ?
you don &apos;t know me from surfing .
nice try , though .
bingo .
the gas your killer used to torch your vic
was purchased on miahi avenue
near kukapu .
nice .
so hopefully our killer used a credit card
so we can pull those receipts
and cross @-@ reference with any suspects .
hey , hey , we &apos;ll need to run this
through handwriting analysis ,
okay , verify that renny actually signed it .
all right , we also have to make sure
that he didn &apos;t sign it under duress .
and there &apos;s the $ 291,570--
a very specific amount of dough ,
obviously for something very specific .
know what ? i &apos;ll have hpd
forensic accountants dig deeper into his financials ,
see if they can find that exact amount anywhere .
all right ?
look , i &apos;m gonna tell i.a. that i took the money .
if you &apos;re calling to talk me out of it , don &apos;t bother .
hey , hey , hey , hey , i &apos;m calling to say good luck , okay ?
mahalo .
against my better judgment , officer kelly ,
this board will entertain your statement
with regards to the missing money
from the asset forfeiture locker .
chairman akahoshi ...
my uncle was devastated by the death of my aunt ,
and in a misguided attempt
to help me salvage my career with hpd ,
he tried to implicate himself .
but the truth is ...
... i took the money .
let me understand this .
you were accused of stealing this money--
an accusation which you denied and fought
to the point of resigning from hpd ...
that &apos;s correct .
and yet now ,
after your uncle comes forward ,
you &apos;re telling us you took the money ?
yes , sir , that &apos;s correct .
he was lying
to protect me .
how do we know you &apos;re not lying to protect him ?
and how would you explain the fact
that after years of monitoring your finances ,
we &apos;ve turned up absolutely nothing--
no large transactions , no new accounts ,
no sign of that money anywhere .
that &apos;s because i never spent it .
you met with i.a. , didn &apos;t you ?
i told them i took the money .
did they believe you ?
not right away .
they said they &apos;d been tracking my spending habits for years .
so i told them i didn &apos;t spend any of it .
they then ordered me to produce all the money
by the end of the day tomorrow .
chin , you don &apos;t have that kind of money .
i know .
no one in our family does ,
and you can &apos;t go to the bank &apos; cause they &apos;ll know .
so where are you going to get it from ?
you need to go back there and tell &apos; em you lied .
just end this .
it &apos;s done .
i &apos;m not going back .
now you should answer that .
thank you .
okay , that was the handwriting analyst ,
who just confirmed that renny did sign the contract
turning the proceeds of the book over to marcum .
no markers indicate that it was signed under duress .
okay , well , that &apos;s definitely going to come
as a shock to marcum .
uh , i just got off the phone
with renny &apos;s attorney in new york .
apparently his will supersedes
any other arrangements he might have made .
okay , who &apos;s , uh , who &apos;s the heir to his estate ?
that &apos;s where it gets interesting .
most of renny &apos;s assets are to be put into a trust ,
all going to a woman named pauline lucero .
who is pauline lucero ?
i have no idea ; we &apos;re running background right now .
she stood to make a lot of money from renny &apos;s death .
she &apos;s got motive .
we &apos;ll talk about it later .
you know that unknown item we found melted in the gas can ?
yeah .
the lab managed to get it out .
a lighter .
not just any lighter . it &apos;s an aeros .
these things go for thousands of dollars .
and our killer used it to light the fire that killed renny .
the butane inside heated up and blew it to pieces .
what do you got ?
i thought that looked familiar .
that &apos;s renny &apos;s fiancee .
alana .
yeah ,
and it &apos;s not just the lighter she &apos;s holding .
it &apos;s our murder weapon .
hey . can i take a seat ?
how you feeling ?
as good as i can , i guess .
what can you tell me about this picture ?
we shot that in l.a.
renny insisted the cake be purple .
they must have brought five cakes
that weren &apos;t purple enough .
where &apos;d you find this ?
we have reason to believe that the lighter you &apos;re holding
in this picture was the lighter that was used
to start the fire that killed renny .
that was renny &apos;s lighter .
the @-@ the client gave it to him as a gift
at the end of the shoot .
when was the last time you saw it ?
yesterday ...
in @-@ in renny &apos;s trailer .
okay . could he have , uh ,
could he have loaned it to anybody ?
that lighter was worth a lot of money , and renny cherished it .
i ... i don &apos;t think he would have given it to anyone .
but there were a lot of people on that beach yesterday ,
so anyone could have stolen it from his trailer .
all right .
listen , have you ever heard of a woman
named pauline lucero ?
no . why ?
according to renny &apos;s lawyers ,
he had just set up a trust for her .
a trust ?
why would he do that ?
i don &apos;t know .
i mean , i ... i know a shannon lucero .
she was one of the first real supermodels .
i used to ...
i used to have a picture of her
up in my room when i was a little girl .
did renny know her ?
yeah .
they , uh , they dated in the early &apos; 90s .
i ... asked him about it once .
he said it ended badly , &apos; cause she ...
she wanted to get married and ... and have kids ,
and he had just started his career ,
and he wasn &apos;t ready .
couple of years ago he heard she had moved to milan .
but they ... they never really spoke after the breakup .
excuse me a sec .
yeah .
chin .
hpd forensic accountants took a look at the amount of money
that renny borrowed from marcum , and get this--
their research turned up that $ 291,570
is the exact amount that the u.s. department of agriculture
reports that it costs to raise a child to the age of 18 .
all right , listen , i think renny and another model
named shannon lucero had a daughter named pauline , okay ?
run shannon lucero through interpol
and the italian embassy .
have kono cross @-@ reference the name lucero
against any receipts from the gas station
we know the killer went to .
you got it .
how long have you been working with him ?
um , tomorrow will be a week .
i was a local hire .
okay , i just got a hit on those gas station receipts .
our mystery woman , pauline lucero ,
she purchased the gas the day renny was murdered .
she &apos;s not a mystery woman anymore .
say hello to amy , the production assistant .
aka pauline lucero .
she &apos;s renny &apos;s daughter .
and our killer .
amy , we need to talk to you .
amy .
it &apos;s over . come on .
you know what ? wait a minute .
pauline , i got to ask you something .
how could you kill your father ?
he wasn &apos;t my father .
yes , he was your father .
no .
he left when my mom was pregnant .
he never even knew me .
and when my mother got sick ,
he turned his back on her .
i tried to contact him ...
but he wouldn &apos;t even take my calls .
okay , i &apos;m sorry ,
so ... so you killed him ?
i had just buried my mother ,
and he didn &apos;t want to have anything to do with me .
all right , so you get a job on his photo shoot
so you can get close enough to him
to burn him alive .
he wanted to be worshipped .
well , now he can be .
well , um , just so you know ,
uh , we did some investigating , and it seems that your father ...
he had a change of heart
when he found out that alana was pregnant .
he wanted you in his life , pauline .
you &apos;re lying .
he set up a trust in your name .
started it with the exact amount of money
he should &apos;ve spent raising you .
what ? yeah , there &apos;s a private detective
in italy right now that he hired looking for you .
mind your head when you &apos;re getting in the car .
