the big bang theory s01e15
on the other hand , some physicists are concerned
that if this supercollider actually works ,
it &apos;ll create a black hole and swallow up the earth ,
ending life as we know it .
pfft , what a bunch of crybabies .
no guts , no glory , man .
hey , check it out .
the school of pharmacology is looking for volunteers .
&quot; we are testing a new medication &quot; for social anxiety , panic attacks ,
agoraphobia and obsessive compulsive disorder . &quot;
why would they be looking for test subjects here ?
i don &apos;t know , raj .
maybe the comic book store doesn &apos;t have a bulletin board .
what &apos;s going on ?
shh , shh , hot girl in sheldon &apos;s office .
sheldon &apos;s office ?
is she lost ?
i don &apos;t think so .
i followed her here from the parking lot .
maybe she &apos;s his lawyer .
well , she &apos;s free to examine my briefs .
howard . i know , i &apos;m disgusting .
i should be punished ... by her .
oh , look , i did it again .
that should do it .
thank you for coming by .
hello .
oh , hey , buddy ...
&quot; buddy ... &quot; ?
sorry i &apos;m late .
i &apos;m working on a project that may take me up on the next space shuttle .
how can you be late ?
i wasn &apos;t expecting you at all .
nobody ever expects me .
sometimes you just look and ...
bam ! howard wolowitz .
sheldon , are you gonna introduce us ?
oh , all right. uh , this is missy .
missy , this is leonard and rajesh , and you &apos;ve already met howard .
it &apos;s nice to meet you .
you , too , as well , also .
yeah .
so , how do you two know each other ?
oh , he once spent nine months with my legs wrapped around his head .
excuse me ?
she &apos;s my twin sister .
she thinks she &apos;s funny , but frankly , i &apos;ve never been able to see it .
that &apos;s because you have no measurable sense of humor , shelly .
how exactly would one measure a sense of humor ?
a humormometer ?
well , i think you &apos;re delightfully droll .
ooor , as the french say , tres drole. okay , so let me see if i got this .
leonard , howard and ...
i &apos;m sorry , what was your name again ?
rajesh .
so , missy , what brings you all the way from texas ?
was it perhaps destiny ? i think it was destiny .
my friend &apos;s s getting married at disneyland tomorrow night .
destiny , thy name is anaheim .
and i had to drop off some papers for shelly to sign for my dad &apos;s estate .
the papers could &apos;ve been mailed .
mom just sent you here to spy on me , didn &apos;t she ?
i guess that &apos;s why they call you a genius .
they call me a genius because i &apos;m a genius .
tell mom that i currently weigh 165 pounds
and that i &apos;m having regular bowel movements .
enjoy the wedding. good @-@ bye .
if the wedding &apos;s not until tomorrow , why don &apos;t you stay with us tonight ?
oh , i don &apos;t think so .
shelly doesn &apos;t like company .
even as a little boy ,
he &apos;d send his imaginary friends home at the end of the day .
they were not friends .
they were imaginary colleagues .
look , you &apos;re here .
we have plenty of room .
no , we don &apos;t .
come on , shelly. she &apos;s family .
so what , i don &apos;t issue invitations to your mother .
well , it would be nice not to have to drive to anaheim in rush hour .
and don &apos;t ever call me shelly .
so it &apos;s settled . you &apos;ll stay with us .
yeah , i &apos;ll walk you to your car .
you &apos;re in structure 3 , level c , right ?
what just happened ?
so anyway ,
we &apos;re eight years old and sheldon converts my
easy bake oven to some kind of high @-@ powered furnace .
just classic .
i needed a place to fire ceramic
semiconductor substrates for homemade integrated circuits .
he was trying to build some sort of
armed robot to keep me out of his room .
made necessary by her insistence on going into my room .
anyway , i go to make those little corn muffins they give you .
there &apos;s a big flash .
next thing you know my eyebrows are gone .
not your eyebrows .
yep ,
i had to go through the entire second
grade with crooked eyebrows my mom drew on .
is that what that was ?
i just assumed that the second grade
curriculum had rendered you quizzical .
hey , leonard , you left your underwear in the dryer downstairs .
those are not mine .
really ?
they have your little name label in them .
yeah ... no , i do ... i ...
i use those , uh , just to polish up my spearfishing equipment .
i spearfish .
when i &apos;m not crossbow hunting , i spearfish .
uh , penny , this is sheldon &apos;s twin sister , missy .
missy , this is our neighbor penny. don &apos;t look that much alike .
can i get a hallelujah ?
fraternal twins come from two separate eggs .
they are no more alike than any other siblings .
hallelujah !
hey , guess what .
i &apos;ve been accepted as a test subject for a
new miracle drug to overcome pathological shyness .
oh , good for you , raj .
yes , i &apos;m very hopeful. hello , missy .
they mentioned there may be side effects .
so , missy , have you ever met a man from the exotic subcontinent of india ?
well , there &apos;s dr. patel at our church .
ah , yes , patel-- good man .
do you like motorcycles ?
&apos;cause i ride a hog .
a hog ?
you have a two @-@ cylinder scooter with a basket in the front .
you still have to wear a helmet .
have you ever heard of the kama sutra ?
the sex book .
the indian sex book .
in other words , if you &quot; wonder , wonder who wrote the book of love ,
&quot; it was us .
so , sheldon &apos;s sister is pretty cute , huh ?
i wasn &apos;t staring .
i didn &apos;t say you were . i just said she was cute .
oh , eh ... maybe , if you like women who are tall ...
and perfect .
sheldon , why are you ignoring your sister ?
i &apos;m not ignoring my sister . i &apos;m ignoring all of you .
i brought snacks !
oh , my , gherkins and ...
onion dip. it &apos;s onion dip .
we don &apos;t entertain much .
missy .
do you enjoy pajamas ?
i guess .
yeah , we indians invented them .
you &apos;re welcome .
yeah , well , my people invented circumcision .
you &apos;re welcome .
missy , i &apos;m gonna go get my nails done .
do you want to come ?
god , yes. thanks .
you &apos;re welcome .
bye , guys. bye , missy .
bye , missy , see you. good @-@ bye , leonard .
oh , yeah , no , uh , bye , penny .
okay , you two have to back off .
why should i back off ? you back off , dude .
excuse me , this is my apartment , and she &apos;s my roommate &apos;s sister .
so what ? you &apos;ve already got penny !
how do i have penny ?
in what universe do i have penny ?
so i can have penny ?
hell , no !
excuse me. can i interject something ?
i &apos;m ordering pizza online .
is everyone okay with pepperoni ?
sheldon , can i talk to you in private ?
i guess .
don &apos;t worry . i was going to order you cheese @-@ less .
thank you. it &apos;s okay .
lactose intolerance is nothing to be embarrassed about .
i &apos;m a fancy indian man .
we invented pajamas .
hey , look at me . i don &apos;t have a foreskin .
sheldon ...
are you aware that your sister is an incredibly attractive woman ?
she certainly has the symmetry and low
body fat that western culture deems desirable .
it &apos;s noteworthy , at other points in history ,
heavier women were the standard for
beauty because their girth suggested affluence .
that &apos;s fascinating , but ...
i didn &apos;t say it was fascinating . i said it was noteworthy .
all right ... noted .
but my point is that koothrappali and wolowitz ,
they &apos;re hitting on your sister .
oh , it &apos;s ...
oh , okay .
you know , i don &apos;t want to criticize your rhetorical style ,
but we &apos;d be a lot further along in this
conversation if you &apos;d begun with that thought .
that &apos;s great , but my ...
what i &apos;m saying is that we took quite an unnecessary detour
from what i now understand to be your thesis .
whatever .
you have to do something about it .
why ?
because she &apos;s your sister .
i don &apos;t understand .
yes , we shared a uterus for nine months ,
but since then we &apos;ve pretty much gone our own separate ways .
okay , uh , consider this ...
with your father gone ,
it is your responsibility to make sure that missy chooses a suitable mate .
i hadn &apos;t considered that .
we do share dna. uh @-@ huh .
so there is the possibility , however remote ,
that resting in her loins is the potential
for another individual as remarkable as myself .
exactly .
and you owe it to yourself and to posterity to protect
the genetic integrity of your sister &apos;s future offspring .
you &apos;re right .
if someone wants to get at missy &apos;s fallopian tubes ,
they &apos;ll have to go through me .
i am shiva the destroyer !
i will have the woman .
i &apos;m warning you i was judo champion at math camp .
all right , now that &apos;s enough juvenile squabbling .
you stop it .
stop it , i say !
i &apos;m going to settle this right now .
neither of you are good enough for my sister .
who are you to decide that ?
he &apos;s the man of his family .
you have to respect his wishes .
you &apos;re out , too , by the way. say what ?
it &apos;s nothing personal .
i &apos;d just prefer if my future niece or nephew
didn &apos;t become flatulent every time they ate an eskimo pie .
what are you so happy about ?
i &apos;m not happy .
it &apos;s the medication . i can &apos;t stop smiling .
that leonard &apos;s made me aware of how high the genetic stakes are ,
we have to face the fact that none
of you are suitable mates for my sister .
wait a minute .
leonard made you aware of that ?
we all make mistakes. let &apos;s move on .
excuse me , but i think you &apos;re missing a big opportunity here .
how so ?
everybody knows genetic diversity produces the strongest offspring .
why not put a little mocha in the family latte ?
in principle , you have a point .
but as a practical matter ,
need i remind you that it takes experimental
pharmaceuticals to simply enable you to speak to the opposite sex .
i think you &apos;re focusing entirely too much on the drugs .
is it &apos; cause i &apos;m jewish ?
&apos;cause i &apos;d kill my rabbi with a pork chop to be with your sister .
this has nothing to do with religion .
this has to do with the fact that you &apos;re a tiny ,
tiny man who still lives with his mother .
sheldon , you are really being unreasonable .
am i ?
here , eat this cheese without farting and you can sleep with my sister .
oh , really ?
oops .
shelly , can i speak to you for a minute ?
alone .
why does everyone suddenly want to talk to me alone ?
usually nobody wants to be alone with me .
we all make mistakes. let &apos;s move on .
okay , i &apos;m not even going to ask why you &apos;re pimping me out for cheese .
but since when do you care at all about who i sleep with ?
well , truthfully , i &apos;ve never given it any thought ,
but it has been pointed out to me that you carry dna of great potential .
what on earth are you talking about ?
let me explain .
you see , i &apos;m a superior genetic mutation , uh ,
an improvement on the existing mediocre stock .
and what do you mean , &quot; mediocre stock &quot; ?
that would be you .
but residing within you , is the potential for another me .
perhaps even taller , smarter , and less prone to freckling , a sheldon 2.0,
if you will .
&quot; sheldon 2.0 &quot; ?
exactly .
now ,
i am not saying that i should be the sole decider of who you mate with .
if you &apos;re not attracted to the suitor ,
then the likelihood of conception will be reduced .
you have got to be kidding me .
not at all .
frequent coitus dramatically increases the odds of fertilization .
okay , shelly , sit down .
now i &apos;ve lived my whole life dealing with the fact that my twin
brother is , as mom puts it , &quot; one of god &apos;s special , little people . &quot;
i always thought i was more like a cuckoo bird .
you know ,
a superior creature whose egg is placed in the nest of ordinary birds .
of course , the newly hatched cuckoo eats all the food ,
leaving the ordinary siblings to starve to death .
luckily for you , that &apos;s where the metaphor ended .
i thought it ended at &quot; cuckoo . &quot;
you listen to me .
if you want to start acting like a brother who cares about me ,
then terrific .
bring it on .
but you try one time to tell me who i should be sleeping with ,
and you and i are going to go round and
round the way we did when we were little .
remember ?
i have an alternate proposal. go on .
you donate eggs .
we will place them in cryogenic storage .
i will find an appropriate sperm donor for your eggs ,
have them fertilized and implanted in you .
that way , everybody wins .
correction .
missy can date whoever she wants .
look , we have to settle this .
i agree .
sheldon &apos;s sister is hiding at penny &apos;s because
we &apos;ve all been hitting on her at the same time .
she &apos;s not hiding .
she needed privacy to call her grandmother who &apos;s apparently very sick .
oh , and then i believe she has to wash her hair .
oh , you poor , deluded bastard .
don &apos;t start with me , dude .
you want to go again ? let &apos;s go .
sit down. okay .
if we &apos;re going to fight over missy , let &apos;s do it the right way .
the honorable way .
take that !
you want some more ?
and he &apos;s down !
one , two , three ...
come on , come on ! get up !
stay down , bitch !
... nine , ten .
yeah ! natural selection at work .
i weep for humanity .
excuse me while i go tell missy the good news .
hey , leonard. oh , hi , penny .
how &apos;s it going ?
listen , that guy mike that you were dating , is that still going on ?
uh , pretty much. why ?
nothing , just catching up .
by the way , may i speak to missy , please ?
of course .
hi , leonard. what &apos;s up ?
well , since you &apos;re leaving tomorrow ,
i was wondering if you &apos;d like to go to dinner with me .
that &apos;s so sweet .
but no thanks .
oh. do you have other plans or ... ?
no. oh .
all right , uh ...
enjoy the rest of your evening .
thanks. see ya .
um , here &apos;s something we didn &apos;t anticipate .
what do you want , howard ?
i &apos;m fine. thanks for asking .
i &apos;ve come to call on missy .
missy .
hi , howard .
the amazing howard .
do you like magic ?
not really. no .
then you are in for a treat .
behold , an ordinary cane .
no .
okay .
missy .
thank you .
i apprec ...
apprec ...
appreeee ...
oh , honey .
is your medication wearing off ?
well , hi , cutie pie .
i was hoping you &apos;d show up .
we had a dog who made a noise like that .
had to put him down .
any news you want me to pass along to mom ?
she might be interested to know that i have refocused my research
from bosonic string theory to heterotic string theory .
yeah , i &apos;ll just tell her you say &quot; hey . &quot;
okay , well , it was pleasant seeing you ,
other than that business with my testicles .
come on , shelly .
i want you to know i &apos;m very proud of you .
really ?
yep , i &apos;m always bragging to my friends about my brother ,
the rocket scientist .
you tell people i &apos;m a rocket scientist ?
well , yeah .
i &apos;m a theoretical physicist .
what &apos;s the difference ?
what &apos;s the difference ? !
good @-@ bye , shelly .
my god !
why don &apos;t you just tell them that
i &apos;m a toll @-@ taker at the golden gate bridge ? !
