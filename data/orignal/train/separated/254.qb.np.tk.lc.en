gossip girl here--
your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
you are running my business
like you &apos;re still the meanest girl in high school .
i need to use my power to form the fashionistas of the future ,
with a line for high school girls
inspired by my constance uniform .
i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t say anything when you told me you loved me .
all i wanted was a fresh start .
that &apos;s what i want .
well , we had to come to some kind of agreement ,
or we never would &apos;ve left that hotel room in monte carlo .
it won &apos;t be much longer , i promise .
we &apos;re happy to extend
&quot; the spectator &apos;s &quot; line of credit .
are you sure wanna cosign on this loan ?
send me the documents to sign in the morning .
when ivy was in the apartment , she said bart walked in
with an envelope he held on to rather tightly .
is there anything missing ?
that painting of the rainbow woman is gone .
in that film , the head of the drug cartel
stored his illegal account information
in the back of a painting .
sold for $ 1.1 million .
that piece is a critical component
of my campaign against bart.
if i topple him , lily won &apos;t be far behind .
i &apos;ll sell you the painting .
where the hell is that envelope ?
someone took it off .
then they &apos;ve got the evidence !
desperate times call for desperate measures .
and even the most disciplined people
can resort to destruction .
funny , i didn &apos;t ask for turndown service .
but did you find what you &apos;re looking for ?
while others try to rebuild bridges
using more intimate tactics .
wow , this is amazing .
really . and i &apos;m not just talking about this espresso .
i wish we could just stay like this forever .
me , too .
the only thing missing is fresh air .
are you--do you think maybe today that we could , uh ...
actually go outside ?
come on . you know that we can &apos;t be seen together in public
until we &apos;re sure that this is absolutely real .
well , i don &apos;t know about you , but i &apos;m pretty sure .
i can &apos;t think of any reason to hold back .
well , here &apos;s a big one .
all of our friends are furious at us .
if we wanna be a couple in the real world ,
we need to go out and make amends .
okay , where do we start ?
i &apos;ll start with blair , and you start with nate .
and then afterwards , brunch and a movie on me . i promise .
okay .
yeah , my , uh , suite needs tidying .
could you please send the maid service ?
on second thought , send all the maids you have .
where is it ? in the safe ?
i see you changed the combination .
what could possibly be so important that you misplaced it ?
your viagra ?
cut the crap , chuck .
there &apos;s the richard phillips . it used to have a backing .
i know you have it .
you mean the papers that hold the proof
to your illegal oil activities ?
papers ?
you don &apos;t have it .
you don &apos;t even know what you &apos;re looking for .
oh , sorry to interrupt this riveting oedipal showdown ,
but i think i have what you &apos;re looking for .
mr. boyer ! mr. boyer !
could i speak with you , please ?
this is completely inappropriate , mr. archibald .
i &apos;m on personal time .
i apologize for the intrusion ,
but you won &apos;t return any of my phone calls .
all right , i &apos;ll be brief , i promise .
look , your credit line was due last week .
now if you can &apos;t come up with the funds ,
i don &apos;t see how i can assist you .
mr. boyer , this paper means everything to me .
i &apos;ve put all my personal assets into it , all right ?
you know how people always tell you to bet on yourself ?
well , that &apos;s what i did , and i just--
i need someone else to bet on me , too .
look , i respect your passion ,
but i &apos;m afraid in this economy ,
people aren &apos;t willing to take a bet .
&quot; the spectator &quot; is not a risk .
it won &apos;t fail because it can &apos;t .
it &apos;s everything i &apos;ve got , mr. boyer .
now if you could just get me a little more time ...
no promises ,
but i &apos;ll talk to the lender .
oh ! thank you . thank you .
i promise you won &apos;t regret it .
yes .
just think , dorota .
i started off dressing the minions ,
and now i &apos;ll be dressing the masses .
miss blair has come long way .
all grown up with her--her own barneys co @-@ op pop @-@ up shop .
now the gift bags must be perfect .
what are you doing here ?
blair , i know that i &apos;ve done some horrible things ,
but i am so sorry , and i &apos;ve come to make amends .
amends would imply that there &apos;s something to be mended .
what you did can never be fixed .
you &apos;ve sworn that our friendship is beyond repair in the past ,
but we &apos;ve always gotten through it .
well , this time is different .
you seduced dan on the bar at the campbell apartment--
the very same spot you deflowered my first boyfriend .
i would never be that cruel to you ...
on purpose .
i won &apos;t accept losing you .
so ... i &apos;m just gonna sit here
until you realize how sorry i am
and how much i love you .
suit yourself .
sit there , quietly , like a mannequin .
that &apos;s what you &apos;re best at anyway .
and what are you best at , blair ?
your new junior line ?
and what makes you think the katniss everdeen generation
is going to care about blair waldorf &apos;s pleated skirts ?
you &apos;re not a teenager anymore .
so ? designers don &apos;t have to be teenagers
in order to influence them . in--in fact , no one--
is talking to you !
just be quiet .
the world already has stella and phoebe
均为设计师
and the mulleavy sisters .
blair &apos;s too old to be the queen bee
and not established enough to be a fashion star .
she &apos;s stuck in the middle .
and what could be less cool than being a tween ?
well , i guess we &apos;ll have to see tonight .
i could tell by the frenzy at the auction ,
there had to be more at stake than just art .
and then i found the microfilm in the painting .
i don &apos;t know what those numbers mean ,
but they obviously mean a lot to you .
name your price .
whatever he says , i &apos;ll double it .
i don &apos;t want money .
what do you want , then ?
lily .
last year , lily did everything in her power
to hurt me and leave me with nothing .
no friends , no family , no home .
i want lily to know how that feels .
that &apos;s my price .
surely there must be something else .
all i want is for lily to be left with no one and nothing .
now whichever one of you makes that happen first
can have the microfilm .
i &apos;ll be waiting to hear your plans .
and be creative .
it went perfectly !
you should &apos;ve seen bart and chuck squirm !
oh ! i can &apos;t wait to see
lily get caught in their cross fire .
you really played this out masterfully .
i &apos;m so proud of you .
i am just glad this is almost over .
i missed you so much , it hurt .
but sometimes
the partner is more shocking than the crime itself .
okay , what if nelly is right ?
what if my line gets lost
because i &apos;m not in high school
or that my dad &apos;s not a beatle ?
miss blair , take deep breaths .
hey , b. , you may not be the queen bee anymore ,
but sage is .
if you get her on your side , all the other girls will follow .
what makes you think sage would do either of us a favor ?
she wouldn &apos;t ,
but she &apos;d do anything to keep me and steven apart .
you are apart .
well , maybe we make it look like we &apos;re getting back together .
i have a photo on my phone .
it &apos;s not a sex tape , but it is a kiss .
maybe we date stamp it
to make it look like it was taken today .
and send to &quot; gossip girl &quot; to trick miss sage .
but all sage would have to do
is ask her dad if it &apos;s true .
it makes perfect sense
that he would cover our relationship .
he knows that sage hates us being together .
so sage sees the blast and comes to me for help ,
just like when she thought steven was proposing ,
which gives me leverage to ask for her support .
i &apos;ll admit , it &apos;s not a terrible plan .
of course , i need photo approval .
let me find it .
acceptable .
now go . no one can suspect we &apos;re conspiring .
of course not .
you know , i @-@ i played hedda gabler in high school ,
but acting like i &apos;m into rufus
when i &apos;m really in love with you
is the hardest role of my life .
you deserve an oscar , darling .
but take solace in knowing that you serve a higher cause .
giving lily her comeuppance ?
though i @-@ i still wish we had taken the money and run ,
like i wanted to .
so do i , but this is what lola wanted .
and lily deserves to pay for the way she treated you .
i owe lola for a lot more than just the money .
i mean , if she hadn &apos;t asked you to help transfer the funds to me ,
i would &apos;ve never met the real you .
even though it was awful to tear myself away from you ,
your plan was brilliant .
well , now you have access to lily &apos;s secrets and influence
to turn rufus against her .
but if i eat another waffle , i &apos;ll puke .
now that our plan &apos;s almost done ,
can &apos;t i please stop this charade ?
not yet . not yet , no .
i mean , the--the microfilm may be our golden ticket ,
but we still have to see if chuck or bart are willing
to sacrifice lily for it .
come on . let me buy you lunch .
and this way ,
you don &apos;t have to subsist on waffles alone .
i know a small , out @-@ of @-@ the @-@ way place .
i &apos;ll pull the car around , okay ?
sounds wonderful .
oh , thank god . i &apos;ve been sick with worry .
did you find the microfilm at charles &apos; ?
no , because chuck doesn &apos;t have it . ivy does .
what ? how ?
she found it in the lining of the painting
before she sold it to chuck the night of the auction .
i am so sorry , bart.
w @-@ what does she want for it ?
you .
she will give the records to me or chuck
in exchange for destroying your life .
with ivy , i &apos;m not surprised .
of course , i would never do anything to harm you ,
but i worry chuck will take her up on her offer .
oh , charles would never actively hurt me .
don &apos;t be naive , lily .
if chuck gets a hold of the microfilm ,
he &apos;ll figure it out .
let me call rufus .
maybe he &apos;ll be reasonable and help me get it back
before anyone gets hurt .
do what you can .
in the meantime , i &apos;ll work on chuck .
you &apos;re not seriously thinking about taking ivy &apos;s deal , are you ?
i may have no choice .
i asked lily for help before . she refused .
sorry to interrupt .
what do you want ?
i came to apologize .
i &apos;ve been doing some soul @-@ searching .
that implies you have a soul .
that &apos;s funny , coming from you .
that &apos;s hilarious . i mean , who would &apos;ve thought
chuck bass turns out to be the good guy
and humphrey the villain ?
well , i @-@ i @-@ i really wanna turn that around .
i &apos;m sorry about what i wrote about all of you .
i &apos;m here to make amends .
well , if you really mean that ...
you just gave me an idea .
瑟琳娜和史蒂文亲吻复合
well , if it isn &apos;t gypsy rose lee ...
without the talent .
i have no need for strippers or sex tapes at my pop @-@ up shop ,
so please run along .
you should be thanking me .
that tape got you exactly what you wanted .
and did it get you what you wanted ?
yeah , it did . my dad and serena split up ,
which is how i want them to stay .
i saw the &quot; gossip girl &quot; blast .
has serena said anything to you
about getting back together with my father ?
she &apos;s my best friend . she tells me everything .
so it &apos;s true .
of course , the minute i go to my mom &apos;s ,
he goes crawling back to her .
he swore to me that things were over between them .
i might be willing to give you some guidance .
that is , if you do something for me .
name it .
you &apos;re the queen of constance ,
and i know there &apos;s a secret society made of the monarchs
of the five most powerful private schools in manhattan .
i know because i created it .
so ?
i want a meeting with the heads of the five families .
make it quick , lily .
i know you hate me , rufus .
you made that abundantly clear
when you helped ivy enact her revenge at the auction .
get to the point .
ivy &apos;s done something now that goes far beyond hurting me .
it endangers my family , my children .
they used to be your family , too .
w @-@ what kind of danger are you talking about ?
ivy &apos;s in possession of some business records .
they &apos;re simple documents .
they mean nothing to anyone outside of our family ,
but they have the power to destroy us .
please find it in your heart to be the bigger person .
get them back for me .
if you had nothing to hide ,
then no one could use this evidence against you .
lily , i &apos;m sorry . you reap what you sow .
i &apos;m not getting involved .
well , thank you for the lovely lunch .
my pleasure .
we &apos;re almost at the finish line , my love .
yeah .
and it looks like chuck will be the winner .
he wants me to meet him now to tell me his plan .
call when you can .
yeah .
i don &apos;t know why you &apos;re here , but get out
before security throws you out .
that &apos;s not a nice way to greet your partner .
what are you talking about ?
you are indebted to me ,
and i &apos;m here to collect .
so unless to wanna lose everything ,
you &apos;re gonna help me defeat chuck .
buck up . it &apos;s gonna be fun .
betrayal is a bitter pill to swallow .
but nothing &apos;s worse
than having blackmail shoved down your throat .
dons nightingale , brearley , chapin , and spence ,
let us now have this meeting commence .
don constance , why is she here ?
i &apos;m here , nightingale ,
because not only was i the queen of constance ,
but i also invented this council .
so as regina emerita ,
it is my royal prerogative to command you to attend
my pop @-@ up event tonight and be fans .
sage , you shouldn &apos;t have brought her here .
this isn &apos;t an alumni event .
don , brearley is right . it &apos;s a clear breach of security .
invoke the order of the secrets .
order of the what ?
codified blackmail .
if they don &apos;t do what you say , you spill their secrets .
look , the rules say i &apos;m entitled
to ask the council for one favor
during my reign . this is it .
and if you refuse , she &apos;ll have no choice
but to reveal your affair with your drama teacher .
your latin teacher ?
your father &apos;s business partner .
what ? that &apos;s how we did it in my day .
we &apos;ll grant don constance her one request ,
and reconvene at the pop @-@ up event .
the attire is festive cocktail !
when did the queens start calling themselves &quot; don &quot; ?
well , everyone loves a crown , but when it comes to power ,
the mob totally trumps the monarchy .
you cosigned my credit line ?
i never asked you to do that .
ingratitude doesn &apos;t become you , nathaniel .
you have put so much work into &quot; the spectator . &quot;
it would be a shame to lose it all now .
i &apos;m not gonna betray my best friend .
my loan will be in default . i &apos;ll file for bankruptcy .
and as for &quot; the spectator , &quot; you can take it .
your loyalty is very touching ,
but i &apos;m afraid your actions have more serious consequences .
you couldn &apos;t resist faking the numbers .
must be ...
an archibald gene .
so you have a choice .
either you can tell me chuck &apos;s plan to win over ivy ,
or you can go to prison
and drag your mother and grandfather
through a public disgrace
even more sensational than that of your father &apos;s .
what &apos;s it gonna be ?
i usually frown upon negotiating with terrorists ,
but stamping out my father &apos;s freedom
has become my life &apos;s mission .
what &apos;s your plan to destroy lily ?
simply play the powerful card we &apos;ve been dealt .
the microfilm &apos;s enough to put her away , too ,
as long as she appears to be bart &apos;s accomplice .
you mean plant it on her .
precisely .
you give me the film , i &apos;ll do the dirty work ,
then tip off the feds .
okay .
but it has to happen in public .
i want prison plus humiliation .
not a problem .
bring the film to blair &apos;s event tonight ,
and i &apos;ll take care of the rest .
done .
dan , what are you doing here ?
oh . hey , dad .
i &apos;m just , uh , just picking up some of my stuff here .
but i &apos;m--i &apos;m mainly here to see you .
i hurt you .
i @-@ i jeopardized our relationship ,
which means more to me than anything .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m here to make amends with you and ivy .
i &apos;m happy you wanna make amends , son ,
but i owe you an apology as well .
it looks like you were right about ivy .
i was a fool for trusting her .
honey , i &apos;m home !
i &apos;ll take that as my cue .
what &apos;s going on ?
you tell me .
i saw you putting someone in a town car today ,
kissing him good @-@ bye .
i opened my heart to you .
i opened my home .
i believed you when you said you were protecting me from lily .
at least have the decency to tell me
what was true and what were lies .
it was all true .
i mean , lily was horrible to you ,
like she is to everyone .
and what about us ?
there was someone else before you .
and i thought it was over , but i ran into him last week
and realized it wasn &apos;t .
i &apos;m sorry , rufus .
pack your bags and get out .
hurry , hurry , hurry ! let &apos;s get to the pop @-@ up !
serena , your scheme is unfolding on schedule .
i except to see you at my event tonight for the denouement .
and ...
i won &apos;t mind if you &apos;re not mute .
i suppose i could use a friend there with me
to celebrate my success .
come on , come on , come on , come on !
don brearley , i just saw my dad ,
who is miserable with heartache .
if he is really back with serena and lying to me ,
he wouldn &apos;t be blubbering like a baby .
we &apos;ve been played .
i &apos;ll see you at the pop @-@ up party but the plan has changed .
hey , man , i did what you asked .
i searched the loft and no luck .
but i saw ivy on the way out
and spotted the envelope in her bag .
did you get it ?
no , i couldn &apos;t .
there was no way . they would &apos;ve seen me .
i understand , which is why i have a backup plan .
ivy will bring the microfilm to blair &apos;s event tonight .
the feds will be there .
i convinced her i &apos;d plant it on lily .
lily &apos;s going to blair &apos;s junior line debut ?
no , but ivy doesn &apos;t know that .
i &apos;d never hurt lily .
i &apos;m sorry i couldn &apos;t be more helpful .
thanks for trying , humphrey .
the important thing is ,
i got to ivy before my father did .
bart.
you &apos;re too late .
i already struck a deal with--
chuck .
a takedown at blair &apos;s fashion party .
but in actuality , he lured you to the empire to distract you
while dan searched the loft .
hold on a sec .
if he was trying to steal the microfilm ,
he didn &apos;t succeed .
chuck has no intention of having lily arrested .
he was planning on screwing you over all along .
and why should i believe you ?
because i have someone here
who can confirm everything i &apos;m saying is true .
isn &apos;t that right , nate ?
it &apos;s true .
luckily , i have an offer for you .
the dons . thank god you &apos;re here .
now ... start fawning . loudly .
and i know that you don &apos;t have a limit on your credit cards ...
so buy , buy , buy !
sorry , blair . i called off the favor .
what ?
i know you duped me about my dad and serena .
i only brought the dons here to be detractors .
and if we say the clothes suck , it &apos;s law .
come on , girls . and remember , plastic stays in pockets .
wait . wait , dons .
dons ?
blair .
i must admit ,
i &apos;m impressed the high school crowd showed up .
we &apos;ll just have to see whether they love or hate the line .
i &apos;ll go get quotes from them for &quot; w.w.d. &quot;
oh ! wait . you know what ?
you simply must see my accessories .
they &apos;re in the corner . the far corner .
this way .
you sure he didn &apos;t see it was me ?
if rufus had seen you , he would &apos;ve said so .
this couldn &apos;t be better .
now i don &apos;t have to invent a reason to break up with him .
this &quot; breakup &quot; mustn &apos;t undo all the work you did
to poison rufus against lily .
i mean , our efforts are for nothing
if rufus takes her back the minute she hits rock bottom .
he won &apos;t take her back .
well , then we &apos;re at the end of our road .
mm , it &apos;s all riding on your meeting with bart.
i &apos;ll do whatever it takes .
it &apos;s been an hour . where is she ?
her phone is still off .
this isn &apos;t a game , mr.bass. you said you had hard evidence .
don &apos;t waste our time again .
chuck . oh , you &apos;re here .
things are going horribly .
girls today are out of control .
they &apos;re like tiny little vultures .
then blair waldorf would be the falcon
who dives in and devours them all .
please . compared to them , i &apos;m like a turtledove .
俄罗斯犹太裔设计师
well , at least nelly &apos;s distracted talking to d.v.f.
i need to find serena and force her to fix things with sage .
the line looks beautiful .
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s going to be a huge success .
unless i can do some damage control ,
there &apos;s no chance of that .
speaking of , i need to do some damage control myself .
well , good luck .
it &apos;s my faith in you that &apos;s firing me up to fix this mess .
did you bring it ?
yes .
i &apos;ll show you mine if you show me yours first .
i &apos;m divorcing lily . here are the papers .
you may leak them to whomever you choose .
that &apos;s hardly enough .
lily &apos;s been divorced four , fives times already .
who can keep count ?
i want her humiliated .
what did you have in mind ?
take off your clothes .
excuse me ?
you heard me . strip .
i should have expected the typical serena sabotage--
pretending to be my friend
and then sending in those mini mafiosas
to blow up my pop @-@ up shop .
sage knows you &apos;re not back with steven .
i wonder who told her .
well , it wasn &apos;t me , i swear .
blair , i just wanna help .
if i choose to believe you , and if you really wanna help ,
then come up with a new scheme
before those teenage goombas ruin everything .
miss waldorf , may i take a picture ?
look , i &apos;ll do whatever you want , but you don &apos;t need a scheme .
your line is spectacular and it speaks for itself .
and there &apos;s nothing that sage or anyone can do to change that .
it &apos;s time for you to start trusting yourself
and accepting the fact that you are obscenely talented .
you really mean that ?
yes . b. , your clothes are beautiful and original ,
like you .
don &apos;t take my word for it . look around .
hey ! what are you doing ?
this is the last size 2 , and i liked it first .
sorry . all &apos;s fair in shopping and war .
what are you guys doing ? !
you &apos;re supposed to be hating on everything .
but we love it ,
and devotion to great clothes trumps five family loyalty .
uh , hi . excuse me .
do you mind if i quote you ?
oh , my gosh .
they like me .
they really like me !
nathaniel , what are you doing ?
it &apos;s not like you to be partying alone .
well , that &apos;s what i want to be--alone ...
and unconscious .
believe me , whatever problems you &apos;ve got at &quot; the spectator &quot;
cannot compare to my day from hell .
so if you don &apos;t mind , i &apos;d like to join you .
chuck ...
it was , uh , it was all my fault .
what was ?
there was nothing i could do .
he cornered me .
&quot; he &quot; who ?
my father ?
you tell me what happened . what did he do ?
what did he make you do ? what ...
tell me .
before we do this ...
the microfilm .
oh . no , we &apos;re not actually going to have sex .
i just wanna take a couple snapshots
to make it look like we did .
all that matters
is that lily believes she lost two husbands to me .
i &apos;m fine being your eliot spitzer scandal ,
but i &apos;m a pay @-@ for @-@ play kinda guy .
the microfilm first .
ivy .
oh , god .
don &apos;t do this .
my father will screw you , then screw you over .
it &apos;s not too late to do the right thing .
behind the curve as always , chuck .
it is too late .
what is this , some kind of joke ?
what in the world are you doing here ?
i know i said i wouldn &apos;t help you , but i changed my mind .
i have what you &apos;re looking for .
they say nothing inspires forgiveness
quite like revenge .
the microfilm was in that envelope , i swear .
if you don &apos;t find it and hand it over--
all the torture you wished on lily ,
it &apos;ll seem like child &apos;s play .
my father &apos;s threats aren &apos;t idle . neither are mine .
there &apos;s only one person who knew i had it ,
who might know where it is .
thanks .
since when did you start spiking your chamomile ?
oh , it &apos;s been a rough day .
hope this makes things a bit better .
you have no idea .
thank you , rufus .
what made you change your mind ?
ivy &apos;s not who i thought she was .
i know . i should &apos;ve been tipped off
by the whole &quot; pretending to be your niece &quot; thing .
well , you always believe the best in people .
it &apos;s your virtue and your downfall .
i still see the best in you , lil .
after everything that we &apos;ve been through ,
it &apos;s probably safe to say that we won &apos;t be together again .
but we were family for a long time ,
and that means something .
i &apos;d really like peace between us .
dad , hey . what are you doing here ?
you inspired me to make some amends of my own , son .
are you getting back together with lily ? w--
no , i &apos;m just returning something of lily &apos;s that ivy stole .
why is this person taking so long getting back to you ?
i ... i don &apos;t know .
where you going ?
does blair need you to come over to kill a spider ?
i &apos;m not wasting any more time .
so you &apos;re giving up ? what a shocker .
you &apos;re right . you know me so well .
my patience is wearing thin .
you better make this person appear fast .
we almost sold out .
i feel like i &apos;m dreaming .
2 girls wrestling for last 3 @-@ button vest .
i go act as referee .
i have always known that i had
the most brilliant , talented best friend ,
but now the whole world gets to know , too .
thank you .
i &apos;m sorry for accusing you of turning sage against me .
no , i &apos;m sorry for everything .
i don &apos;t think i was ever able to get over how hurt i was
that you were dating dan , which is why i acted so badly .
i get it . if you &apos;d have dated chuck ,
i would &apos;ve scratched your eyes out .
i &apos;ve really missed you .
i missed you , too , b.
you &apos;re about to get everything you ever wanted ,
and tonight &apos;s success is-- is just the beginning .
well , this line was inspired by both of us ,
ruling constance together .
this is your success , too .
i just hope that this night leads to ...
the other thing i &apos;ve always wanted--
to be with chuck .
he loves you more than anything in the whole world .
you &apos;ll find your great love , too .
um , i should probably get going .
but breakfast tomorrow morning ? sarabeth &apos;s ?
yes . 9 a.m. sharp .
congratulations , b.
thank you .
lily , please !
don &apos;t protect him .
why wouldn &apos;t i protect my husband ?
he &apos;s the only one that protects me .
no , that &apos;s not true .
you &apos;re the one willing to go to any lengths ,
and i &apos;ve had enough of it .
i know you wanna believe he is a changed man ,
that he is a good man .
and i wanted to believe that , too , so badly .
but the truth is , is he is a ruthless criminal .
if you destroy that evidence ,
there is nothing to stop him from hurting anyone ,
including you .
that &apos;s ridiculous , charles .
he would never hurt me .
since his return , he has done nothing but prove his love .
you once told me my father was incapable of love .
that is the truth .
i just saw him in a hotel room , half @-@ naked ,
wiith ivy .
that lie ...
is beneath even you , charles .
i &apos;m not gonna let you or anyone else
threaten our family ever again .
don &apos;t !
ashes to ashes . dust to dust .
even the best @-@ laid plans can go bust .
where have you been ?
i &apos;ve been calling for an hour .
i just got your messages .
are you--
okay ? no ! i &apos;m not okay !
our plan failed .
okay , rufus must &apos;ve taken the microfilm from my purse
and given it to lily .
i was with bart when she called him
to tell him that she destroyed it .
so lily &apos;s ... still with bart ?
yes .
and now that he knows i &apos;m after lily ,
he &apos;s threatened to destroy me .
look , he &apos;s scary , william . he &apos;ll do it .
calm down for a second .
i can &apos;t !
can &apos;t you see that without the microfilm ,
we can &apos;t fight back ?
i know that i @-@ i promised lola that
we &apos;d do everything we could to destroy lily .
but ... we &apos;ve done everything that we could .
you &apos;re right . i suppose we should ...
leave and regroup for now .
i know that we didn &apos;t get lily , but ...
the most important thing is that we have each other .
of course .
hello ?
so chuck &apos;s little game is over , nathaniel .
in spite of you tipping him off , he lost .
of course , once a loser , always a loser .
why don &apos;t you go give your ...
s @-@ stirring little victory speech to someone who cares ?
oh , yeah . that &apos;s right . no one does .
you &apos;re just lucky that lily destroyed the microfilm
and bought you a reprieve .
i own you , and you better start acting like it .
what , you gonna call the police ?
all right , fine . just do it . have me arrested .
oh , you &apos;re of more use to me out of jail ...
for the moment .
you owe me .
sober up
and get ready to pay the price .
there you are .
the line was a gigantic success .
even the mannequins were stripped naked .
and now we are having a fete at the atelier to celebrate ,
so of course i need you by my side .
and why haven &apos;t you been answering your phone ?
i &apos;m happy for you , blair .
forget me .
chuck ?
what happened ?
what i should &apos;ve always expected .
the only parent who ever loved me ,
the mother who chose me as a son ,
abandoned me .
i finally had the evidence to vanquish my father .
she destroyed it to protect him .
we &apos;ll find new evidence .
we &apos;ll find another way .
there is no other way .
this was it . it &apos;s over .
well , even if we can &apos;t put bart behind bars ,
we &apos;ll still be together .
stop ... lying to yourself .
we made a pact .
you fulfilled your side . i failed at mine .
we can &apos;t be together .
chuck ...
please .
go .
just go .
so i finally made amends with blair ,
and we &apos;re in a really good place and i couldn &apos;t be happier .
how was your day ?
i hate to compete ,
but i made amends with chuck , nate , and my dad .
wow . i &apos;m impressed .
yeah , all right .
so now that we &apos;ve knocked down our last obstacles ,
are we finally ready to do this ?
well , do you remember that we said
if we ever jumped into a relationship again
that would be it ?
that we would only get one more chance ?
are you sure that
i &apos;m the one person you wanna be with ?
are you talking about blair ?
serena , yes , i &apos;m sure you are the one .
but whether or not i &apos;ve admitted it to myself ,
you have always been the one .
how about you ?
yeah , i &apos;m sure .
wait . hold on .
i thought the whole point of this was to go public .
uh , what--what happened to getting fresh air ?
i mean , shouldn &apos;t we go out and get a drink or something ?
suddenly , i &apos;m okay with being a shut @-@ in .
let me at least get champagne so we can celebrate .
sometimes the light is so dazzling
it &apos;s all you can see .
other times , dark clouds devour you ,
and it seems the skies will never clear .
but when the sun beams while the rain falls ,
it can bring a bittersweet rainbow .
i only have a minute .
humphrey , going rogue is not part of our agreement .
where the hell have you been ?
i &apos;m writing the serena chapter .
what ?
so watch out .
just when you think you &apos;re dancing off into the sunset ,
a lightning bolt may strike you down .
x.o.x.o. , gossip girl .
