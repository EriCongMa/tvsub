you must be elena .
how do we look exactly alike ?
you &apos;re a petrova doppelganger .
you &apos;re the key to breaking the curse .
the sun and the moon curse ?
vampires and werewolves used to roam freely
until a shaman put a curse on them
to limit their power .
klaus is the real deal .
from the first generation of vampires .
the oldest vampire in the history of time is coming after me ?
katerina , i have missed you .
klaus !
klaus is in alaric &apos;s body .
he &apos;s possessing it !
and while i &apos;m gone ,
you stay here , katerina .
elijah .
one of the originals . he &apos;s a legend .
so that &apos;s it .
as long as we keep the dagger in there ,
then he stays dead .
elijah had no weapon to kill klaus .
but he believed that if a witch could channel their power ,
it wouldn &apos;t need one .
he says if you use too much of your powers at once ,
it &apos;ll kill you .
bonnie will not die for me .
i will not let that happen .
she &apos;s the only one who can do it .
we &apos;ll find another way .
elijah .
katerina !
excuse me .
ah , good evening , trefor .
i am pleased you could join us .
i could not miss the birthday celebration .
no , considering the gift you claim to bear .
where is this mystery girl of which you speak ?
right this way .
my dear .
hello .
elijah ! it &apos;s me , it &apos;s elena .
shh .
oh , my god .
forgive me . you remind me of someone .
katerina , may i introduce
the lord elijah .
pleasure , my lord .
the pleasure &apos;s mine . katerina .
what ...
i can &apos;t--i can &apos;t breathe !
what &apos;s happened to me ?
are you ok ?
i can &apos;t ... i can &apos;t be in this house .
you &apos;re not invited in .
you need to get me out of here .
what happened ?
i &apos;ll tell you .
not here .
can i trust you ?
can i trust you ?
elena !
hey .
hey .
have you seen elena ?
uh , no .
hi , sweetie .
oh , my coffee .
good morning .
mm , good morning .
hey , where &apos;s elena ?
i don &apos;t know , stefan .
it &apos;s your girlfriend . mine &apos;s right here .
oh , and how &apos;s the shoulder ? got time for a bite ?
i &apos;m so hungry .
oh , it &apos;s really messy .
can you just use a blood bag today ?
i &apos;m already late for work .
no !
hey , it &apos;s me . where are you ? call me .
what are you doing ?
she &apos;s not a wind @-@ up toy .
it &apos;s really none of your business , is it , stefan ?
yeah .
what she said .
i have to go to work .
ugh ! bye .
ok .
no , she didn &apos;t .
i &apos;ll be back as soon as i can .
yes , do hurry .
i &apos;m anxious to get out of this body .
and if you get hung up ,
call me . you know how impatient i get .
where is he going ?
to retrieve me .
so i can get out of this bad hair @-@ do .
are you sure that &apos;s a good idea , klaus ?
well , the full moon is almost upon us .
i &apos;ve killed the witch , i have the moon stone ,
and the doppelganger is waiting in the wings .
ohh , i am ready to break this curse .
and why would you do that here ?
there &apos;s so many people that would try to stop you .
because i have to .
it &apos;s the birth place of the doppelganger .
i didn &apos;t realize that was a requirement .
well , how could you ? you betrayed me
and fled england before i could give you the details , katerina .
but i did find your birth place
and i slaughtered your family .
so i guess we &apos;re cool .
let &apos;s just hope that elena
isn &apos;t as stupid as you are .
she won &apos;t run .
she &apos;ll die before she lets anyone
that she loves get hurt .
and that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;m counting on .
you can &apos;t leave until i tell you to .
you look better .
where did you get the dagger ?
i &apos;ll tell you everything .
but we have to work together , elijah .
i need your word .
your ability to make demands has long passed .
no demands .
i &apos;m offering you my help .
and in return , i want yours .
and why should i even consider this ?
the same reason that you haven &apos;t killed me .
you need my help to kill klaus .
and i need you .
where are you ?
are you ok ?
yes , i &apos;m fine .
where &apos;s elijah ?
he &apos;s right here .
where ? i &apos;m on my way .
no , stefan , elijah and i need some time alone .
listen to me . he can &apos;t be trusted .
he &apos;ll use you to get to klaus .
elijah is a noble man , stefan .
he lives by a code of honor . i can trust him .
he knows that i &apos;d be incredibly stupid to betray him again .
by removing the dagger , i have proven myself .
you can &apos;t do this alone .
it &apos;s my decision ,
stefan . please respect it .
and make sure
that damon doesn &apos;t do anything stupid .
we &apos;ll be in touch .
did she just hang up on you ?
she did .
she &apos;s lost it .
if anyone can get him to help us kill klaus , it &apos;s her .
bonnie &apos;s the way to kill klaus , stefan .
he thinks she &apos;s dead .
we have a chance with her .
she &apos;ll kill herself in the process .
elena &apos;s looking for another way .
her way &apos;s going to get her killed .
so we need to find her and stop her .
no , you need to back off .
what ? !
look , i don &apos;t like this any more than you do .
but we need to trust her .
we gotta just let her do her thing .
that might be your plan .
mine &apos;s better .
i said back off .
he &apos;s here .
klaus is here ?
he &apos;s taken over alaric &apos;s body .
of course he has .
one of his favorite tricks .
well , what are his other tricks ?
what is he going to do next ?
you &apos;re the only one who knows him .
yes , i do .
so where is this mysterious host
i &apos;ve heard so much about ?
fashionably late .
he likes to make an entrance .
here he is .
katerina , may i introduce to you
the lord niklaus .
niklaus is the name my father gave me .
please
call me klaus .
elijah !
elena , what are you doing here ?
what happened ?
i &apos;ve had a bit of an incident , carol .
i &apos;m hoping you could help .
well , i &apos;m on my way to a meeting , so i--
we won &apos;t take but a minute of your time .
of course . anything you need .
thank you .
well , first things first .
i &apos;m going to need a change of clothing .
well , we can try one of my husband &apos;s suits .
i haven &apos;t boxed them up yet .
wonderful .
how did you know she &apos;s not on vervain ?
cause i &apos;m the one who got her off it .
right before you and your friends killed me .
twice .
if you &apos;ll excuse me , i &apos;ll be down a moment .
hello ?
hey , stefan .
it &apos;s jenna .
jenna , hey .
where &apos;s elena ? and jeremy ?
no one &apos;s answering their phones .
ah , elena &apos;s not here at the moment .
is ah ... is everything ok ?
she left me all these weird
messages telling me to stay away from rick .
what &apos;s going on ?
it &apos;s really hard to explain over the phone , but ,
she was hoping that you
could stay on campus for a little while longer .
oh , that &apos;s kinda hard to do from my kitchen .
wait , you &apos;re home ?
yeah . what &apos;s going on ? where &apos;s elena ?
i &apos;m supposed to meet rick at the grill for lunch ,
to talk .
jenna , listen to me carefully .
whatever you do , do not meet alaric at the grill .
i &apos;m going to come over right now
and i &apos;ll explain everything .
wow , i &apos;d love to lend you a hand ,
but you wouldn &apos;t want me doing anything stupid .
seriously going to be like this ?
you and your girlfriend are calling the shots .
i &apos;m just backing off , stefan .
let &apos;s go .
where are we going ?
splitting from the team . going rogue .
come on .
so i assume that the martin witches are no longer with us .
no .
i &apos;m sorry .
and katerina .
she would have been released
from my compulsion when i died .
klaus took her .
we think that she may be dead .
i doubt that .
not klaus &apos; style .
death would be too easy for her after what she did .
i don &apos;t understand .
you say that you want klaus dead ,
but you still made katherine pay for betraying him .
i have my own reasons for wanting katerina to pay .
there was a time ...
i &apos;d have done anything for klaus .
from where have you come , katerina ?
i &apos;m new to town , my lord .
katerina is from bulgaria .
zradevei , katerina .
very good .
do you mind , brother ?
i would like to have a moment alone with her .
not at all . happy birthday , brother .
yes .
klaus is my brother .
i heard that .
i &apos;m still processing .
yes , i &apos;m a little behind on the times ,
but i believe the term you &apos;re searching for
is &quot; o.m.g. &quot;
i really don &apos;t think that this is a good idea .
you &apos;re an investigative journalist .
we &apos;re investigating .
alaric , are you home ?
it &apos;s andie starr , jenna &apos;s friend .
thank god .
wow ! you were right .
she looks exactly like elena .
yep .
thought you might be dead .
unfortunately not .
hey , jenna . thank you so much
for not going to the grill .
um , stefan--
no , listen .
i can explain .
hi , stefan .
how &apos;s it going ?
there &apos;s a whole family of originals ?
my father was a wealthy land owner
in a village in eastern europe .
our mother bore seven children .
so your parents were human ?
our whole family was .
our origin as vampires is a very long story , elena .
just know ... we &apos;re the oldest vampires in the world .
we are the original family ,
and from us all , vampires were created .
right , but klaus is your brother .
and you want him dead ?
i need some air .
i &apos;m still feeling a tad ... dead .
come .
what are you doing here ?
we are here to rescue you .
no , sweetie .
we are here to see if she deserves to be rescued .
right .
i figured you still might be kicking .
alari @-@ klaus was blending way too easily .
figured he had probably had some coaching .
is that ...
vervain ? your salvation .
it &apos;s not going to undo anything .
there &apos;s always a loophole . did he tell you
to stay in this apartment until he said it was ok to leave ?
you can &apos;t say .
did he tell you to do absolutely everything he says
until the end of time ?
no .
there &apos;s your loophole .
drink this and prevent any further compulsion .
give it to me .
answer one question first .
you double @-@ crossed us with isobel , why ?
i didn &apos;t think you could stand a chance against klaus ,
so i was looking out for myself .
and where did that get you ?
here .
be careful with that .
if he finds out you have that ,
you &apos;re never getting out of here .
you owe me .
and i will collect .
come on .
nice to meet you .
you know , i find chopping ...
calming .
the feel of the blade in the hand , maybe .
i &apos;m still waiting for
someone to tell me what the hell &apos;s going on .
well , would you like to tell her , stefan ,
or should i ?
tell me what ?
do you believe in vampires , jenna ?
no ?
well , who does , right ?
but believe it or not ,
they do have a place in our history .
and as a history teacher ,
i find them fascinating .
why are we talking about this ?
well , you &apos;ve been angry with me for keeping secrets ,
and this is one of my secrets .
i &apos;m obsessed with vampires .
there . i said it .
are you joking ?
not at all .
how about you , stefan ?
are you a fan of vampires ?
in literature .
bram stoker .
it &apos;s dense , but i appreciate it .
hmm . did you know that vampires are the oldest creatures of the night ?
except for werewolves , of course .
werewolves .
werewolves .
now i know you &apos;re joking .
you know , i &apos;ve read that there &apos;s an aztec curse
on both species .
that keeps werewolves slaves to the moon
and vampires bound by the sun .
isn &apos;t that right , stefan ?
you know , they say these creatures would do anything to have this curse broken .
and that they wouldn &apos;t care who they had to kill to do it .
so as you &apos;ve seen , nothing can kill an original .
not sun , not fire , not even a werewolf bite .
only the wood from one tree ;
a tree my family made sure burned .
that &apos;s where the white ash for the dagger comes from .
yes .
the witches won &apos;t allow anything truly immortal to walk the earth .
every creature needs to have a weakness in order to maintain the balance .
so the sun can &apos;t kill an original .
why is klaus so obsessed
with breaking the sun and moon curse ?
right .
the curse of the sun and the moon .
it &apos;s also ... biblical @-@ sounding , don &apos;t you think ?
what &apos;s so funny ?
look , the roman parchment .
i remember etching this scroll .
well , i was quite blistered from drink .
your finest work remains your aztec drawings .
not the african carvings ?
cause i was quite proud of those .
the aztec .
who can resist a shaman ?
yes .
i don &apos;t understand .
so klaus drew the aztec sketches about the curse ?
roman scrolls , african tribal etchings ,
and any other culture or continent we felt like planting in it .
but why ?
easiest way to discover the existence of a doppelganger
or to get your hands on some long , lost moon stone
is to have every single member of two warring species
on the lookout .
so it &apos;s not aztec at all ?
the curse of the sun and the moon ... is fake .
it doesn &apos;t exist .
what ?
oh , i know this all sounds so crazy ,
but ... vampires are real .
would you care for some more wine ?
get out .
excuse me ?
i don &apos;t know what it is you &apos;re trying to do
or why you &apos;re saying these things , but--
jenna .
i said get out !
you heard her .
i &apos;m afraid i don &apos;t want to .
fine ! i &apos;ll go .
you &apos;re not going anywhere .
stefan !
jenna , get out of here now !
you can &apos;t kill me , stefan .
watch me !
stefan !
i may not have a witch protecting me today ,
but if you kill this body ,
what &apos;s to stop me from choosing jenna as my next one ?
jenna , go .
but you &apos;re--you--
i said go !
kill me .
just remind elena
how easy it will be for me to get my revenge
if she tries to stop me from breaking this curse .
klaus and i faked the sun and moon curse
dating back over a thousand years .
but if there &apos;s no curse ...
there &apos;s a curse . just not that one .
the real one &apos;s much worse .
it &apos;s a curse placed on klaus .
what are you talking about ?
klaus has been trying to break it for the last thousand years .
you were his only hope .
what is this curse ?
your phone will not stop its incessant buzzing .
answer it , please .
stefan--
what &apos;s wrong ?
no .
no , no , no , no .
ok , i &apos;ll be right there .
klaus went after jenna . i have to go to her .
i &apos;m afraid that wasn &apos;t part of today &apos;s arrangement .
she &apos;s my family , elijah . i have to .
i &apos;ll be back .
you have my word .
that doesn &apos;t mean anything to me
until you live up to it .
thank you .
you have to chase me !
you &apos;re meant to catch me .
but if i catch you , the game will be over .
thank you for entertaining me .
you seemed lonely inside , so i took pity on you .
klaus promised to spend the day with me ,
but he never returned home from the night .
yes , klaus does not live by any rules but his own .
he is a very charming man .
hard for anyone to resist , i suppose .
and yet ...
i know not why he courts me .
he seems to not care about me at all .
many a union has been built on much less .
is it wrong to want more ?
did you have more with trefor ?
trefor believes that he loves me ,
but true love is not real unless it &apos;s returned .
do you agree ?
i do not believe in love , katerina .
that is too sad for me to accept , my lord .
life is too cruel .
if we cease to believe in love ,
why would we want to live ?
what do i interrupt ?
he &apos;s returned .
long night .
what has happened ?
the wrong village picked a fight at the tavern .
oh , jenna , thank god .
no .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i never meant for any of this to happen .
when i was little , your mom used to tell me bedtime stories .
stories about vampires .
i never thought that what she said could be true .
it is true , jenna .
i should have told you .
i thought that if you didn &apos;t know , you &apos;d be safe .
but then things got so out of control .
and everything i had done to keep you out of it ,
it just blew up in my face .
who else knows ?
jeremy ?
john ?
we were just trying to protect you .
protect me ?
i &apos;m so sorry .
i will tell you everything .
no , elena ... i am the one who &apos;s supposed to be protecting you
and jeremy .
i know , but there &apos;s
nothing that you could have done . there &apos;s so much more to it--
no , this is-- this is so--
i don &apos;t know how-- it &apos;s--
i know , hey .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ? !
i &apos;m scared .
i know .
i know .
i know , hey .
i &apos;m sorry .
jenna , i am so , so sorry .
is she gonna be ok ?
she &apos;s in shock .
i tried to tell her as much as i could ,
but i barely scratched the surface .
i &apos;m so sorry , elena .
i hate this .
it &apos;s not your fault , stefan .
it &apos;s mine .
anyway ...
i have to go back .
to elijah .
wait , what ? no , no !
stefan , i promised him that i would return .
i can &apos;t break that promise .
oh .
yeah .
i &apos;ll be ok .
where do you think you &apos;re going ?
back to elijah .
no .
get out of my way , dam--
if you so much as try and take a step
out of this house ...
damon , easy .
stay out of this , andie .
let her go .
are you kidding me ? we just got her back .
you heard me .
i said let her go .
that &apos;s twice today you &apos;ve stood in my way .
i wouldn &apos;t try a third .
you mind turning that down ?
why so grumpy ?
well , this body has outlived its usefulness .
do you want a drink ?
no , katerina , i don &apos;t want a drink .
come on . it might loosen you up .
what i want
is for you to sit down
and shut up .
maddox , what took you so long ?
you &apos;ve got a lot of luggage .
greta . finally .
hello , love .
nice body .
you ready to get out of it ?
welcome back .
tell me .
what is klaus &apos; curse ?
please .
my family was quite close ,
but klaus and my father did not get on too well .
when we became vampires ,
we discovered the truth .
klaus was not my father &apos;s son .
my mother had been unfaithful many years before .
this was the darkest secret .
klaus is from a different bloodline .
of course , when my father discovered this ,
he hunted down and he killed my mother &apos;s lover
and his entire family .
not realizing , of course ,
that he was igniting a war between species
that rages until this day .
a war between the species ?
the vampires ...
and the werewolves .
so klaus &apos; real father was from a werewolf bloodline ?
what does that make klaus ?
a werewolf ?
or a vampire ?
he &apos;s both .
a hybrid would be deadlier
than any werewolf or vampire .
nature would not stand for such an imbalance of power .
therefore the witches , the servants of nature ,
saw to it that my brother &apos;s werewolf side
would become dormant .
that &apos;s the curse that klaus wants to break ?
he wants to trigger that part of him that &apos;s a werewolf .
if allowed , klaus would sire his own bloodline .
he &apos;d build his own race .
endangering not just vampires ,
but everyone .
but you helped him .
i helped him because i loved him .
that &apos;s changed , now he must die .
we have the dagger now . we can stop him .
when a werewolf is wounded by silver ,
it heals .
an original can &apos;t be killed by anything
but white oak ash on a silver dagger .
so you see the conundrum .
the dagger does not work .
what , are you saying that klaus can &apos;t be killed ?
there &apos;s one way to kill any supernatural species--
at the hands of the servants of nature themselves .
a witch .
if they can channel that much power .
but it would kill them .
the curse must be broken during the full moon .
when klaus is in transition .
that &apos;s when he &apos;ll be at his most vulnerable .
a witch with enough power ...
can kill klaus .
what if i told you
that i knew a witch
that could channel that much power ?
then i would tell you
there &apos;s one more thing that you should know .
the full moon is tomorrow , brother .
after all these centuries , it is finally time .
i have been to see the witches .
they believe they may have found a way
to spare the doppelganger .
what does it matter if she lives or not ?
she &apos;s a means to an end , that is all .
what , she should die for your gain ?
she is human .
her life means nothing .
i beg you to consider this .
are you so foolish
as to care for her ?
of course not .
love is a vampire &apos;s greatest weakness ,
and we are not weak , elijah .
we do not feel ,
and we do not care .
we did once .
too many lifetimes ago to matter .
tell the witches not to bother .
the sacrifice will happen as planned .
you found a way to save the life of the doppelganger ?
yes , elena .
i did .
but unfortunately ,
katerina took matters into her own hands first .
i believe you already know how that played out .
you cared about her , didn &apos;t you ?
it &apos;s a common mistake , i &apos;m told .
and it &apos;s one i won &apos;t make again .
you don &apos;t have to be so mad at your brother .
you know , he &apos;s worried about elena , and ...
just go , please .
i know you &apos;re worried about her , too .
andie .
go .
ok .
tired of your little play thing already ?
don &apos;t start with me , stefan .
she &apos;s just my distraction .
she &apos;s a person . you &apos;re victimizing her .
you should be thankful she &apos;s here .
she keeps me from going for what i really want .
you &apos;re right .
thank you .
for being in love with my girlfriend .
and there it is .
there it is .
you know , you can be in love with elena all you want
if it means that you &apos;ll protect her .
but i have the one thing that you never will .
oh , yeah ?
what &apos;s that ?
her respect .
stop !
what have you done ?
i don &apos;t understand .
katerina has gone . she has fled .
no .
what did you tell her ?
i told her nothing .
do not lie to me !
i will find her .
you have my word .
if you do not ,
i give you my word you will be dead .
now you &apos;ve invited him in ?
elijah and i have renewed the terms of our deal .
really ?
the two of you will come to no harm at my hands .
i only ask for one thing in return .
what ?
an apology .
a what ?
i &apos;m sorry for the part
that i played in your death .
i was protecting elena .
i will always
protect elena .
i understand .
sacrifice is going to happen , damon .
bonnie will be able to kill klaus without hurting herself
and elijah knows how to save my life .
i told you i &apos;d find another way .
and i did .
is that true ?
it is .
and you &apos;re trusting him ?
i am .
you can all go to hell .
he &apos;s angry with me right now .
but he &apos;ll come around .
perhaps .
i thought i told you to leave .
you didn &apos;t compel me .
i want to be here .
just let me be here .
i &apos;m upset .
and you know what happens when i &apos;m upset .
you have to leave .
no .
you need to know that somebody cares about you .
i care about you , damon .
hey . look at me .
get out of here , before i kill you .
just go .
go .
now !
elena ?
now that &apos;s more like it .
back to elijah .
no .
get out of my way , dam--
if you so much as try and take a step
out of this house ...
damon , easy .
stay out of this , andie .
let her go .
are you kidding me ? we just got her back .
you heard me .
i said let her go .
that &apos;s twice today you &apos;ve stood in my way .
i wouldn &apos;t try a third .
you mind turning that down ?
why so grumpy ?
well , this body has outlived its usefulness .
do you want a drink ?
no , katerina , i don &apos;t want a drink .
come on . it might loosen you up .
what i want
is for you to sit down
and shut up .
maddox , what took you so long ?
you &apos;ve got a lot of luggage .
