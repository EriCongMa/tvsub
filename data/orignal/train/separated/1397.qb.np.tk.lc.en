i might as well tell him not to come ...
because you guys are just going to embarrass me again .
sweetie , hang on a second .
you &apos;re 15 , and it &apos;s the first time you &apos;ve had a boy over .
i &apos;m bound to be a little surprised ,
but i &apos;m not gonna embarrass you .
i better charge the camcorder .
i &apos;m kidding . come on . who are you talking to ?
i &apos;m the cool dad . that &apos;s- that &apos;s my thing .
i &apos;m hip . i- i surf the web .
i text . &quot; lol &quot; - laugh out loud .
&quot; omg &quot; - oh , my god .
&quot; wtf &quot; - why the face ?
um , you know , i know all the dances to high school musical , so-
* we &apos;re all in this together *
* yes , we are *
* we &apos;re all stars something , something you know it *
mom ! dad !

luke just shot me !
i didn &apos;t mean to .

no .
the little bitch shot me .
language ! they &apos;re only plastic bbs . it was an accident .
what did i tell you would happen if you got him a gun ?
deal with this .
buddy , uncool .
that &apos;s it ? that &apos;s- no , no , no , no .
the agreement was that if he shoots someone , you shoot him .
we were serious about that ?
yes , we were .
and now you have to follow through .
i &apos;m so sorry .
liar .
go .
he &apos;s got a birthday party .
what &apos;s more important here , dad ?
you can shoot him afterwards . he &apos;ll be home at 2 : 00 .
i can &apos;t shoot him at 2 : 00 .
i &apos;m showing a house at 2 : 00 .
what about 3 : 00 ?
no , he &apos;s got a soccer game at 3 : 00 .
and then- oh , we gotta leave for that dinner thing at 5 : 00 .
4 : 15 . you could shoot him at 4 : 15 .
yeah , i guess that works for me . oh !
&quot; shoot luke . &quot;
sorry , dude . it &apos;s on the calendar .
oh , come on !
i &apos;m quitting soccer . it is a game for children .
no , you &apos;re not quitting .
you would have stopped that goal
if you weren &apos;t staring at that little girl .
she is not a girl . she &apos;s a woman .
you know , gloria , that little blowup with that other mom
why do you have to do things like that ?
if somebody says something about my family ,
i &apos;m going to
i &apos;m just saying .
you could take it down here a little bit . that &apos;s all .
oh , yeah . &apos; cause that &apos;s where you live , down here .
but i live up here !
yeah , but ,
you don &apos;t have to be so emotional all the time.that &apos;s all i &apos;m saying .
manny , you &apos;re with me on this , right ?
i wanna tell brenda feldman i love her .
oh , for god sakes .
manny , she &apos;s 16 .
oh . it &apos;s okay for you to take an older lover ?
hey , watch it .
i wanna go to the mall where she works .
but first i need to get my white shirt , the silk one .
okay . if that &apos;s what you really want to do .
seriously . not to be the evil stepdad ,
but if you put on a puffy white shirt ...
and declare your love for a 16 @-@ year @-@ old ,
you &apos;re gonna be swinging from the flagpole
in your puffy white underpants .
stop the car .
oh , where are you going ?
see ? you hurt his feelings .
ah- well , if it toughens him up a little bit then-
oh , geez . he &apos;s picking flowers .
manny &apos;s very passionate , just like his father .
my first husband- he &apos;s very handsome , but too crazy .
it seemed like all we did was fight and make love ,
fight and make love , fight and make love .
one time , i &apos;m not kidding you , we fell out the window together .
which- which one were you doing ?
i &apos;m hearing this for the first time .
this doesn &apos;t worry you ?
she barely slept on the plane and she &apos;s still wide awake .
oh , stop worrying .
i can &apos;t .
that- that orphanage was all women .
maybe she just- she can &apos;t fall asleep unless she feels a woman &apos;s shape .
i guess that &apos;s possible .
so here .
what the hell is that supposed to mean ?
yes ,
i &apos;ve gained a few extra pounds while we were expecting the baby ,
which has been very difficult .
but apparently your body
does a nesting , very maternal , primal thing ...
where it retains nutrients-
some sort of molecular physiology thing .
but that &apos;s science .
you can &apos;t- you can &apos;t fight it , so-
i &apos;m not saying anything .
you &apos;re saying everything .
count to three .
one , two-
three .
okay .
oh , cam . this is beautiful .
oh , my god . do you love it ?
yes , i-
what the hell is that ?
i had andre do it while we were gone .
is that us , with wings ?
we &apos;re floating above her , always there to protect her .
okay . well , that &apos;s reassuring , right , lily ?
yes , we tore you away from everything you know ,
but don &apos;t worry , things are normal here .
your fathers are floating fairies .
no , can you call andre ,
have him paint something a little less gay ?
by the way , we need to stop having friends
with names like andre .
redheaded dad is angry daddy .
no , i &apos;m not .
yes , you are .
even pepper pointed it out on the way home from the airport .
okay , that &apos;s another one- pepper .
okay , what &apos;s up ?
all right , look . i-
i- i never told my family we were adopting a baby .
and ...
i know .
you do ?
yeah , and i don &apos;t blame you . i know your family .
you &apos;d tell &apos; em . they &apos;d say something judgmental .
exactly .
you &apos;d get mad .
i know . and then something that &apos;s supposed to be nothing but joyful
suddenly turns into this huge fight .
and who wants a big , emotional scene like that ?
thank you . thank you .
i &apos;m so- i &apos;m so relieved you understand .
i invited them over for dinner tonight .
what ?
i had to .
this would have gone on forever . you &apos;re an avoider .
no . no . no . cam , i &apos;m calling them right now and canceling .
no , you &apos;re not .
you &apos;re telling your family you adopted a baby , tonight .
and you do have avoidance issues . even longinus said so .
are- are you really not hearing these names ?
don &apos;t answer it ! i &apos;ll get it !
hi . hey , you must be dylan .
hey . dylan . yeah .
i &apos;m haley &apos;s mother .

let the eyes do the work .
your mouth might be saying , &quot; hey , we cool , &quot;
but your eyes are like , &quot; no , we not . &quot;
&quot; nice to meet you . &quot; &quot; no , it &apos;s not . &quot;

okay , i see you two guys-
wait , wait , wait .
you two-

you &apos;re very strong , homes .
thanks .
okay . nice- nice soft landing .
there you go .
okay , let &apos;s go . come on .
i am on my side though .
so just flip me right back , and we &apos;re good .
we &apos;ll be good .
i just need to get flipped right on my back ,
and we should be fine . so-
brenda feldman .
what is that ?
a poem i have written for brenda feldman .
of course it is .
i put my thoughts into words and now my words into action .
hey , i &apos;ll give you 50 bucks not to do this .
i &apos;m 11 years old . what am i gonna do with money ?
what are you gonna do with a 16 @-@ year @-@ old ?
he &apos;s like a bullfighter .
mmm . you ever see a bullfight ?
i can &apos;t watch this .
you &apos;re in such a bad mood .
and i know why . it &apos;s because that man thought you were my father .
no .
yes .
no .
when you say &quot; no &quot; like that , it &apos;s always &quot; yes . &quot;
come on . we &apos;re in the mall .
let &apos;s get you , like , some younger clothes .
there &apos;s a store there .
i don &apos;t need any younger clothes .
and i don &apos;t care what some jackass
in a pair of ripped jeans thinks about me .
good . you shouldn &apos;t .
you should only care what i think .
i love you , and i don &apos;t care how old you are .
so stop being a gloomy goose and stop being so hard on manny .
the only reason i &apos;m hard on manny ...
is just because i don &apos;t wanna see him make a fool of himself .
and i can smell that hair goo of his from here .
look , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s gonna happen to him over there .
but you &apos;re his family now , and that means only one thing-
you be the wind in his back , not the spit in his face .
what ?
it &apos;s something my mom always says .
it &apos;s gorgeous in spanish .
look , he &apos;s there .
she has a boyfriend .
oh , i &apos;m sorry , mi nino .
i gave her my heart ,
she gave me a picture of me as an old @-@ time sheriff .
that was pretty stupid of me , wasn &apos;t it ?
no , mi amor .
it was brave . right , jay ? brave .
w @-@ well , you &apos;ll know better next time .
come on . let &apos;s get a pretzel .
mentira . a me se me gusta .
uh , excuse me , sir .
we ask that all mall @-@ walkers stay to the right .
alex , get out ! mom !
alex , leave your sister alone .
i was just getting my book . gosh .
i know , sweetie . but you need to respect their privacy .
what are they doing up there ?
nothing .
lying on her bed , watching a movie .
okay . okay .
um , i &apos;m making a cake for tonight .
you wanna help me with the frosting ?
sure .
so , you know , if haley got pregnant ,
would you ever pretend she has mono for a few months ,
and then , like , tell everyone the baby &apos;s yours ?
what ?
this senior at school was &quot; out sick &quot; for four months ,
but jenna resnick swears she saw her breast @-@ feeding
at a coin @-@ op car wash .
buddy , what are you wearing ?
nothing .
uh @-@ uh . no jacket .
one hat .
how many pairs of underwear do you have on ?
one .
six .
first of all , it would be really cool to see haley that fat .
and how awesome would it be
to have a fake little brother who &apos;s really my nephew .
haley is not getting pregnant .
just saying &quot; if . &quot;
i know .
and i know you like to make trouble for your sister ,
but it &apos;s not gonna work this time .
you know why ? &apos; cause your sister &apos;s a good girl .
i know . i was just like her when i was-
i want you to know , i &apos;m not enjoying this .
but this is an important lesson that you &apos;re learning .
so , soak it . keep it .
you &apos;re too close . it &apos;s gonna hurt .
it &apos;s supposed to hurt .
and why are you smiling ?
i &apos;m- what ?
oh , forget it . i can &apos;t do this .
the point is you &apos;re scared . i think you &apos;ve learned your lesson .
mom ! what are you doing ?
oh , hey ! i was just , um , dropping off some laundry .
is this a bad time ?
yeah .
oh . okay .
uh , can you shut the door , please ?
actually , we &apos;re just gonna go ahead and leave that open .
why ?
because i have , uh , seen this little show before-
lying on the bed with a tall senior .
one minute you &apos;re just friends , watching falcon crest ,
and the next you &apos;re lying underneath the air hockey table
with your bra in your pocket .
mom !
you hit my bone !
it was an accident !
i thought you were my friend !
i am your friend .
dad ! dad , dad . you have got to talk to mom .
she is , like , completely freaking out and embarrassing me !
honey , your mom isn &apos;t always as cool about things as-
what is with this thing ?
my dad .
uh , my dad still isn &apos;t completely comfortable with this .
um- he @-@ he still does this thing . it &apos;s been five years now .
and he still does this thing where he announces himself ...
before walking into any room we &apos;re in ...
just to make sure he doesn &apos;t have to ever see us kiss .
wish my mother had that system .
remember ?
not now .
i still can &apos;t believe you did this to me .
would you get in the spirit of things ? it &apos;s a celebration .
oh , god .
okay , i &apos;m gonna go get lily ready .
okay .
and i want you to just come straight out with it .
all right .
okay . you can do this .
yeah . sports guy chest bump .

so how was your trip ?
it was good . it was good actually .
but , um , about that , i- i
have something that i need to tell you guys .
um- uh , we didn &apos;t just go to vietnam for pleasure .
we , uh , kind of have some big news .
oh , god . if cam comes out here with boobs , i &apos;m leaving .
dad .
i hope he didn &apos;t embarrass you , mom .
oh , don &apos;t mind her . haley had her first boy over today ...
and phil shot him .
anyway , um , so , about- about a year ago ,
cam and i started feeling this longing , you know ,
for something more , like , uh , maybe a baby ?
ooh , that &apos;s a bad idea .
what do you mean , &quot; bad idea &quot; ?
well , kids need a mother .
i mean if you two guys are bored , get a dog .
okay , we &apos;re not bored , dad .
i support you , mitchell , even though you &apos;re not my son .
i @-@ i @-@ i @-@ i think what dad is trying to say ...
is that , mitchell , you &apos;re a little uptight .
kids bring chaos , and- and you don &apos;t handle it well .
that &apos;s not what dad &apos;s saying .
that &apos;s what you &apos;re saying .
and it &apos;s insulting in a whole different way .
okay , people . let &apos;s all &quot; chillax . &quot;
hey , where &apos;s uncle cameron ?
thank you . thank you .
someone who &apos;s not insulting me notices he &apos;s not here .
oh , so that &apos;s the big announcement , huh ?
you two broke up .
well- well , a baby wasn &apos;t gonna help that anyway .
and let me tell you . you &apos;re better off ,
because he was a bit of a drama queen .
no , no , no . stop . stop . no .
you come into my house and you insult me and my boyfriend ,
who , by the way , is not that dramatic-
we adopted a baby .
her name is lily .
exciting !
just turn it off .
i can &apos;t turn it off . it &apos;s who i am .
the music .
oh , yes , the music .

the little princess .
she &apos;s so cute !
thank you .
let me see her . let me see her .
hi there , lily .
&quot; lily . &quot; isn &apos;t that gonna be hard for her to say ?
phil .
excuse me .
okay , i @-@ i @-@ i know that i said i thought this was a bad idea .
but , uh , what do i know ?
i mean , it &apos;s not like i wrote the book on fatherhood .
been trying all my life to get it right . i &apos;m still screwing up .
right , manny ?
i wrote a song about it in the car .
of course you did .
anyway , i &apos;m happy for you .
and , uh , you should know that , uh ,
i &apos;m not here to spit in your face ,
i &apos;m here to ... blow at your back .
i don &apos;t understand what that means .
i don &apos;t-
well , it &apos;s- it &apos;s supposed to sound better in spanish .
oh , that &apos;s beautiful . that &apos;s really nice .
and thank you too .
anyhow , mitch , uh-
no , dad , it &apos;s- it &apos;s- -
i got her . i got her .

hey , you &apos;re a cutie , aren &apos;t you ?
ah . look at this .
we &apos;re from different worlds , yet we somehow fit together .
love is what binds us , through fair or stormy weather .
i stand before you now with only one agenda-
&quot; to let you know my heart is yours ,
feldman comma brenda . &quot;
i mean , seriously .
luke , so far , hasn &apos;t beaten me in basketball .
it &apos;s 2 @-@ 0 . 2 @-@ 0 . okay . okay .
get that weak stuff out of my kitchen !
dad , stop it !
can you do me a favor ? just grab-
how &apos;s the weather down there ?
but when the day comes that he does win-
if- you know- if / when-
he beats me , i &apos;m just gonna be like ,
&quot; well done . well done . &quot;
just , like , let him- just support him ...
in- in- in that kind of stuff .
i mean , i &apos;d probably want to go , like ,
two out of three and just see what happens there , but-
