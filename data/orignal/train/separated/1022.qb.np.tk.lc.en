i deciphered the phone number
that kate dialed from the plane .
whatever this thing &apos;s hiding , it &apos;s not the music .
i think it &apos;s a keyhole
any idea what kind of code it is ?
i have something very intriguing for you .
fowler bought the explosives that blew up kate &apos;s plane .
two parts . two @-@ part code ?
i don &apos;t know if he &apos;s interested in the music box .
i think he just wants to find fowler .
whatever you think happ-- tell me why you killed kate !
i don &apos;t know who the guy is pulling these strings ,
but i had finally gotten a meeting with the intermediary .
julian larssen .
we trained together in special forces .
get two lines in .
neal ...
we need to go .
he &apos;s in a medically induced coma .
there &apos;s nothing you can do for him here .
but there &apos;s something you can do out there .
come on .
our suspect .
his name is julian larssen .
this is who shot moz ?
we think so .
and , according to fowler , he &apos;s the right hand
behind whoever &apos;s manipulating you --
kate , the music box , everything .
where is he now ?
he &apos;s gone to ground .
if he &apos;s smart , he &apos;ll leave town ,
and we need to make sure that doesn &apos;t happen .
how &apos;d you stay ahead of me when i was after you ?
and don &apos;t say good looks and charm .
aliases . i had several .
i kept burning them .
and i kept making new ones .
but this passport -- i recognize the work .
it &apos;s a forger out of belgium .
larssen doesn &apos;t forge his own i.d.s.
it &apos;s not easy .
you need specialized equipment , ink , paper .
if we burn all of his aliases ,
he &apos;ll have to have new papers made
by someone here in the city . - exactly .
i &apos;ll work up a list of all of larssen &apos;s aliases
and start shutting &apos; em down ,
put him on every watch list
until he has no way out of new york .
all right , i &apos;ll talk to the forger community
to make sure he can &apos;t buy another one .
wait .
what if we let him buy one ,
one that we pick ?
julian larssen worked intelligence
in special forces .
you served with him .
we need to find any aliases he might be operating under .
jones , put him in holding till i finish with this guy .
larssen &apos;s a regular at your bar .
what name does he use there ?
uh , i can &apos;t remember .
and keep in mind
that i know about your expired liquor license .
what ... ?
forget it , caffrey .
the only thing you ever bring is trouble .
this isn &apos;t about me .
diana , how &apos;s it going ?
we &apos;ve burned larssen &apos;s kyle albertson alias .
good . i &apos;ve got another name to add to the list --
brian blitek .
on it .
all right , i think that &apos;s everyone .
thank you all for coming .
what &apos;s this about , caffrey ?
the man in this photo is going to come to you
looking for a new identity .
when he does ,
i want you to make him the best i.d. that you can .
what &apos;s the angle ?
i &apos;m gonna tell you what name to give him --
justin springer .
come on , caffrey .
it &apos;s bad for business .
it &apos;s not for me .
it &apos;s for mozzie .
is this the guy who ... ?
yeah .
you want new york i.d. or out @-@ of @-@ state ?
don &apos;t pull it out , buddy . don &apos;t pull it out .
they did it .
they finally got me .
what happened ?
the bullet missed your heart by two millimeters .
that &apos;s because i don &apos;t have a heart .
oh , well , look at the bright side .
you &apos;re not dead .
i know . it &apos;s worse .
i &apos;m in the system .
not exactly .
&quot; ivan bliminse &quot; ?
invisible man ?
that &apos;s apropos .
look , i hate to ask you this , moz .
but i need to i.d. your shooter .
can you ... ?
i can &apos;t .
okay .
we can do it later .
i can &apos;t remember .
it &apos;s okay .
we &apos;re gonna find him .
diana &apos;s taken out the last of larssen &apos;s aliases .
how &apos;s your end ?
mozzie &apos;s awake .
that &apos;s great .
how &apos;s he doing ?
he quoted nietzsche to a nurse . he &apos;s gonna be okay .
good .
neal , can he i.d. larssen ?
no . no , he doesn &apos;t remember .
all right . well , we &apos;ve hit larssen hard .
it &apos;s his move .
you &apos;re coming after me now ?
i &apos;m not after you .
tell me why you shot my friend .
your fbi friends are making it very hard
for me to leave the city .
i &apos;d like you to change that .
you want me to help you ?
i want to make a deal .
there &apos;s nothing you could offer me .
i was hired to kill your friend .
what if i deliver you the man behind the curtain ?
not even that .
i guess you &apos;ll never know who ordered the shooting ...
or who killed kate .
larssen made you an offer so he can leave out of town ?
yeah .
he &apos;s more desperate than i thought .
he shot your best friend .
what could he possibly offer you ?
larssen shot mozzie on orders .
he &apos;s offering me the man who gave the order .
wait , is this the same man
who &apos;s responsible for kate &apos;s death ?
yeah .
you make that deal , a killer walks free .
neal , you can find your revenge in the justice .
it &apos;s there .
i know .
you &apos;re not listening to me .
you are listening to me .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m here .
this time ... we do it your way .
no .
come on , peter .
no . - they have this whole --
no . no , the fbi is not gonna
pay for your combat training .
think about what i could do for you guys
if i knew how to fight .
no , i &apos;d rather not .
new york is safer
if neal caffrey is lacking in at least one skill set .
okay , what about self @-@ preservation ?
no , you &apos;ve done pretty well with the whole running @-@ away thing .
it suits you .
get a dog .
can i borrow satchmo ?
no , you can &apos;t borrow satchmo .
did you take my mug ?
i think everyone knows not to touch your mug .
elizabeth gave it to me . i need my coffee .
boss , guess who just booked a flight to samoa
a week from tuesday ?
justin springer , one @-@ way ticket .
got you , larssen .
your forgers did well .
they did .
where is he now ?
tracked him to an apartment in queens .
search warrant ?
judge is putting it through now .
excellent . we &apos;ll get coffee on the way .
fbi !
fbi ! put your hands in the air !
you could have knocked .
julian larssen , you &apos;re under arrest
for murder and attempted murder .
get him out of here .
so what now ?
we tear this place apart .
i want to find evidence
directly linking larssen to the shootings .
i want to nail this son of a bitch .
jones ?
check that plant .
bet ballistics finds a match .
it &apos;s nice to see you &apos;re recovering , bud .
doctor says you &apos;ll be out of the wheelchair
in the next couple days .
it builds something .
what does ?
the code inside the music box .
it &apos;s an equation that builds something .
we don &apos;t need to talk about this right now .
i was shot for that code !
now that larssen took my notebook ,
they have the equation , too .
i &apos;ll be damned if they &apos;re gonna build it before i do !
all right , you need to rest .
i &apos;ll rest when this is done .
when this is finished , i &apos;m retired .
okay , you know , deathbed epiphanies aren &apos;t your style .
if this is about not being able to remember , moz --
it has nothing to do with that .
i betrayed everything i believe in .
what are you talking about ?
i narc &apos;ed !
i was the one who told the suit you were going after fowler !
i was serious .
the reason the bullet missed my heart
is because i don &apos;t have one !
you told peter ?
i &apos;m a judas , a turncoat , a quisling !
thank you . - i --
if you hadn &apos;t , moz ...
i might have killed fowler .
and fowler didn &apos;t kill kate .
he didn &apos;t ?
then who did ?
the guy larssen &apos;s working for ...
i think .
so what does this coded equation build ?
i have no idea .
yet .
how long have they been in there ?
a long time .
something &apos;s not right .
you offered caffrey a deal .
he doesn &apos;t make deals around here .
i do .
now , you &apos;re a gun for hire ,
a bullet aimed at a target .
i want to know the man who &apos;s pulling the trigger .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
i &apos;m innocent .
burke . a moment ?
did we get the ballistics ?
the inside of the barrel was filed down .
we couldn &apos;t make a match .
he &apos;s hiding his trail . what about prints ?
the outside of the gun was wiped down .
agent roe .
what &apos;s department of justice doing here ?
forensics found a single print inside the weapon .
it was yours , agent burke .
that &apos;s impossible .
the print was found inside the slide .
the only way it could have gotten there
was if you assembled the gun .
this is absurd .
agent burke , you &apos;re hereby on leave
until this investigation is completed .
peter , your gun and your badge .
what about larssen ?
we can &apos;t hold him .
uncuff him .
huges , you can &apos;t let him walk out of here .
stay out of it , caffrey . uncuff him .
i &apos;ll send you a bill for my door .
agent burke ...
you have to leave the building , as well .
boss ?
what happened ?
larssen destroyed me .
i knew that &apos;s where they gone .
no , we have to give them everything they ask for .
what do you got there ?
oh , mozzie &apos;s care package , per his specific request .
we &apos;ve got gluten @-@ free brownies and bendy straws .
he &apos;s definitely feeling better .
straws , though ?
we &apos;ll get through this .
i know .
that was diana .
department of justice has pulled all my files .
that was fast .
evidence tampering --
doesn &apos;t get any worse than that .
every case i &apos;ve closed will be brought into question .
maybe i &apos;ll get my anklet off sooner than i thought .
you might .
how the hell did larssen plant my print ?
he could &apos;ve used a photo @-@ etched metal master of the print
and used it to cast a latex positive .
okay , let me rephrase that question --
where the hell did larssen get my fingerprints ?
he didn &apos;t get it out of your personnel file .
the print on the gun has detail outside the print on file .
did he get it from a door knob ?
no , too many other people touch it .
he &apos;d need a clean print , preferably off a hard surface .
what ?
my mug .
it disappeared .
you think larssen &apos;s brazen enough to walk into the fbi ?
if he was , we &apos;ve got him on camera .
i think i got something .
this is the elevator lobby from two nights ago .
is that caffrey ?
no , wait a second .
he doesn &apos;t walk like caffrey .
you don &apos;t think that &apos;s larssen , do you ?
try camera &quot; b. &quot;
does he go into peter &apos;s office ?
zoom in . there .
that &apos;s the mug .
hold on , hold on .
go back 10 seconds on &quot; b. &quot;
i can &apos;t get a clear shot of his face .
he &apos;s playing the camera angles with the hat .
yeah , but look behind him .
look at the glow on peter &apos;s desk .
desktop monitor .
that wasn &apos;t on before he entered .
he was on peter &apos;s computer .
look , i know you and peter have been up to something ,
and i &apos;ve been patient .
i just need to know what the hell is going on .
peter should be the one to tell you .
catch yourself cheating yet ?
i tried , but my opponent &apos;s always one step ahead of me .
imagine that .
look familiar ?
it &apos;s larssen .
how &apos;d he get past security ?
he used a maintenance pass .
the guys at the booth
are used to seeing a guy wearing a hat walk into my office .
he got onto my computer when he was there .
what &apos;d he do ?
well , he erased all history of being there .
fortunately , i keep a secret keylogger on my computer .
i have never appreciated your distrust of me more .
larssen logged in and erased something from his own file .
there &apos;s a copy of his most recent file ,
and there &apos;s a copy of a few days ago .
he erased the name frederick bilal ?
he &apos;s a nigerian prince .
i thought those only existed in spam e @-@ mail .
bilal likes to race horses internationally .
he owns a number of shipping companies ,
and he handles a lot of import and export
out of new york harbor .
where can we find his royal highness ?
he spends his days at the rodgers yacht club .
rodgers is pretty tough to get into .
yeah . i can &apos;t flash my badge anymore .
you don &apos;t need one .
i &apos;ll go in as an upper @-@ crust spoiled elite .
i &apos;ll make a scene , then you come in ,
and you &apos;re pissed at me because --
the only options aren &apos;t the law or the con , neal .
hey , it &apos;s peter .
i &apos;m calling in a favor .
you get the plan , peter .
i do . i do .
hello .
sorry , sir . members only .
they &apos;re with me .
sara ellis , sterling bosch insurance .
hi , sara .
hi , peter .
neal . it &apos;s been a while .
nice to see you fully clothed .
love the hat .
so ... you &apos;re a member ?
my company insures a number of yachts here .
thanks for the assist .
i owe you one .
that &apos;s our guy .
prince bilal .
a prince , huh ?
i &apos;ve been a prince .
when was that ?
yeah , when was that ?
you want me to talk to him ?
why you ?
&apos;cause of your situation ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
you make it sound like i &apos;m dying .
things are complicated at the fbi .
but i don &apos;t need a badge to do good detective work .
all right , then what &apos;s your in ?
he likes horses .
keep an eye on his boat .
he &apos;s like superman without his powers .
how you doing ?
turn on the horse races , will you ?
channel 12 .
yes . sir .
what ?
puddle of money cost me 100 grand last time he ran .
oh , that &apos;s what you get for betting the chalk .
puddle will always fail to fire on the home turn .
a racing enthusiast !
yeah .
thank god .
everyone here just wants to talk sailing .
well , clark kent seems to be doing pretty well for himself .
what now , boy wonder ?
you &apos;re mixing your superheroes .
oh , god . and you &apos;re working guard duty .
&quot; keep an eye on something &quot; is code
between me and peter , okay ?
it means do some digging , see what i can find .
does peter know that &apos;s what it means ?
so your company ships around the world ?
we do .
give me some advice .
i have a couple horses i want to race internationally ,
but the mandatory quarantine period is killing my profits .
any way around that ?
what you &apos;re suggesting is illegal .
so is giving you an inside track on
whether one of my jockeys is gonna be dragging the reins
in an upcoming race .
i &apos;ll check the logbook tonight .
i appreciate that .
mm ! okay , here we go ! here we go !
and they &apos;re off !
come on !
come on , come on !
is that the captain of bilal &apos;s yacht ?
yeah . what are you thinking ?
who &apos;s the owner of this club ?
frank wellington .
does he come out here often ?
rarely . i take it that &apos;s who you &apos;ll be ?
only if you &apos;ll be my mrs. wellington .
all right .
your wallet , please .
marriage is based on trust .
trust that i have my baton ,
and i really do love to hit people with it .
thanks .
50 bucks if you pop by
and give this to that lady in the blue dress right there .
say hi .
you gave him my wallet ?
oh , he &apos;ll give it back .
probably . follow my lead .
this the yacht ?
it is . isn &apos;t it it perfect ?
yes .
excuse me . are you the captain ?
i am .
i &apos;m afraid we &apos;re unavailable for charter till early november .
oh , no . my lovely wife , she &apos;s -- she &apos;s dead set on this boat .
could we get a tour ?
excuse me , mrs. wellington .
you dropped this .
oh . thank you so much .
she does have her moments .
give him a $ 50 , will you , sweetheart ?
as a thank you .
of course . thank you .
thank you , ma &apos;am .
you &apos;re mr. wellington ?
you caught me . call me frank .
i &apos;ve met frank wellington .
oh , i &apos;m sure you have . i &apos;m his son .
just call him &quot; junior . &quot; everybody does .
honey , what should we do now ?
maybe i can convince someone to give us their reservation .
who &apos;s taking her out next ?
i &apos;m sure i know one or two of the names in your logbook .
you know , i would love
to just ask you a couple questions over here .
may i ?
first of all ,
how much do you think it would cost -- i know this is silly --
but to paint the whole thing pink ?
wow . um , you know , i &apos;m not sure .
let me check on that , and i &apos;ll get back to you .
wonderful . thank you so much .
he bit on the horse races ?
he did .
peter burke -- cowboy .
why does that make so much sense ?
i grew up in upstate . lots of horses .
you pick up a thing or two .
sara , thanks for your help .
yeah . thanks for the shotgun marriage .
anytime .
you want the good news ?
sure .
according to the log , every time larssen came to new york ,
someone named brian blitek rented his yacht .
that &apos;s one of larssen &apos;s aliases .
larssen comes to town , smuggles something , then leaves .
something important enough to break into the fbi to hide .
what &apos;s the next step ?
normally , i &apos;d get a search warrant on the docks ,
do a wiretap and surveillance on larssen and bilal ,
and catch them red @-@ handed
smuggling whatever it is they smuggle .
what if we get someone else to arrest him ?
what do you mean ?
we can do all the things you mentioned .
we &apos;ll just do it my way .
a con .
nothing illegal , but if we ...
all right .
just hear me out .
i saw what you did there .
if it means bringing larssen down , i &apos;m in .
nothing illegal .
no .
how do we do it ?
first , you &apos;ll need to form a crew .
burke &apos;s crew ?
welcome to the other side .
thanks , peter .
oh , i &apos;m fine .
you &apos;re gonna need it .
thanks for coming , jones .
of course .
i don &apos;t know why you kept me out of the loop in the first place .
to protect you .
to protect me ?
from who ?
julian larssen has hurt a lot of people in my life ,
and now peter could lose his job ,
and every case he &apos;s solved could be in jeopardy .
well , why didn &apos;t peter just tell me ?
well , he &apos;s not a complainer .
okay , what is this about ?
a music box ?
open it up , it plays a little tune .
ballerina goes around on top ?
something like that .
this one &apos;s a little more special .
it damn well better be .
it belonged to catherine the great .
i thought you stole it .
so did a lot of people .
it &apos;s worth a lot of money , isn &apos;t it ?
yeah .
but more importantly , it contains a code .
a code to what ?
we don &apos;t know yet .
mozzie &apos;s working on it .
mozzie ?
we need to figure it out before they do .
who &apos;s &quot; they &quot; ?
larssen &apos;s working for someone ,
someone very powerful and very connected .
clinton , what i &apos;m asking you to do
isn &apos;t sanctioned by the bureau , and it &apos;s very dangerous .
you can walk away right now , no questions asked .
i &apos;m on your team , peter .
i &apos;ll back your play .
anything to get out of that van .
so you need me to help you take down larssen ?
you don &apos;t have to go anywhere near this .
our fbi access has been cut off .
we ... we need some equipment .
oh , so it &apos;s just my equipment you need
to take down a murderer and save peter &apos;s career .
yeah .
and ... i &apos;ll owe you one .
my equipment goes where i go .
does that mean you &apos;re in ?
now , what kind of wife doesn &apos;t support her husband ?
i &apos;m in , junior .
retired . out of the business .
mozzie , i am not here to recruit you .
i am just here to give you your care package .
oh ! excellent !
you know , they do wash the glasses here .
oh , yeah .
有谣言说其实他已在1966年去世
next you &apos;ll tell me that paul mccartney
wasn &apos;t replaced by a lookalike in 1966 .
how do they plan on catching larssen ?
oh , they &apos;ll figure it out .
honey , you need your rest .
and , hey , you , uh , you might actually like retirement .
what ?
why are you helping us ?
i like having neal caffrey owe me one .
you &apos;re fun to work with .
i like getting inside your head .
so i &apos;m research ?
something like that .
from larssen &apos;s interrogation ,
there are 99 words that you can use .
if you stick to these ,
the computer converts them to larssen &apos;s voice .
&quot; not over the phone . &quot;
&quot; too dangerous . &quot;
&quot; not over the phone . &quot;
&quot; too dangerous . &quot;
oh . watch your sibilance .
easy on the s &apos;s .
okay .
too dangerous .
too dangerous .
much better .
i owe you one .
&apos;kay .
do you want to prank @-@ call peter ?
absolutely .
okay .
right now . let &apos;s do it .
the little guy &apos;s not coming ?
i sent my best operative to get him .
i know you &apos;re all surprised to see me .
not one of you is surprised to see me .
amateur .
nicely played , mrs. suit .
good luck with your little con .
it &apos;s not a con !
well , technically , it is a con .
it &apos;s a sting .
yeah , but a sting &apos;s another word for --
okay , let &apos;s start the sting .
let me start by saying we have limited resources
and no other backup .
the six of us are all we have .
the burke six . i like it .
i appreciate you guys being here .
all right , here &apos;s the deal --
larssen is using our prince bilal as a smuggler .
we &apos;re gonna spook bilal into contacting larssen .
and larssen is going to tell bilal to make the delivery to us .
how &apos;s that ?
oh , i &apos;m glad you asked .
every day , bilal takes a regular route
from his apartment to the yacht club .
diana , you &apos;re gonna flash your badge
and scare him into making a call to larssen .
i can scare him .
i know .
you &apos;re gonna do it in front of this phone booth .
jones , you &apos;ll install a transmitter
which will reroute any call that he makes to us .
yeah , but nobody uses pay phones in new york anymore .
agreed .
mozzie , do you still have your cellphone scrambler ?
russian surplus with a two @-@ block radius .
but it &apos;s cumbersome .
plus , it needs to be hidden
in something that &apos;s motorized with a power source .
that &apos;s where i come in .
very good , ironside .
thank you .
we knock out his cell ,
force him to make the call on our pay phone .
he &apos;s gonna know it &apos;s not larssen on the other end .
that &apos;s where sara comes in .
we &apos;re using her voice @-@ modulation software .
oh , that stuff never works .
well , the software that &apos;s legal in the u.s. doesn &apos;t .
oh . a lady who colors outside the lines .
once we catch bilal smuggling red @-@ handed ,
we flip him on larssen .
wait , wait , wait , wait .
a true con gets you everything you want .
suit , once this is all finished ,
we may have larssen ,
but you &apos;re still framed for planting the gun .
one con at a time .
sara , you ready to go ?
yep .
neal , remember -- only the words on the board .
all right .
i have eyes on bilal .
right on time .
okay . get out of there .
i &apos;m out .
diana , mozzie -- you &apos;re up .
frederick bilal ? diana berrigan , fbi .
i &apos;m interested in your yacht .
i don &apos;t think you can afford it .
then how about i confiscate it instead ?
all right , mozzie , now .
weigh both options . that &apos;s the only thing ...
houston , we have a problem .
his call is redirecting here .
you need to talk him off the phone .
all right . hello ?
i must have dialed the wrong number .
your turn .
lose him .
hey , man .
i think he &apos;s expecting a woman .
we have reason to believe
your docking logs aren &apos;t quite in order .
then you &apos;ll have to take that up with my lawyer .
i was thinking about taking it up with brian blitek .
or should i say julian larssen ?
hand me that . i &apos;ll dump him .
no , you &apos;re not .
hello ?
angela , is that you , sweetie ?
honey , i can hardly hear you . can you call me back later ?
we can &apos;t leave our conversation the way we did .
okay , honey , this is what i want you to do .
i want you to go , and i want you to buy me some flowers .
you know the ones i love .
when you walk through the door , i want you to kiss me .
then you &apos;re gonna sweep me off my feet ,
and you &apos;re gonna make love to me .
can you do that ?
uh ... yeah , i can .
good . i &apos;m gonna pretend
this conversation never happened , and so are you .
now get off the phone and go .
now it &apos;s the burke seven .
i told you , you have no proof .
for now . but we &apos;ll find some soon .
have a nice day .
spare some change ?
come on . look around .
oh , you &apos;re a true samaritan , sir .
ah . told you .
new yorkers don &apos;t carry change anymore .
all right , neal , you &apos;re up .
watch your s &apos;s .
all right .
what ?
what ?
julian , we must talk .
why ?
why ?
the fbi just paid me a visit .
they &apos;re looking into your shipment .
not over the phone .
not over the phone .
too dangerous .
too dangerous .
no , i &apos;m going to get rid of it .
no !
no !
i will pay you ...
i will pay you ...
... bubble .
... bubble .
double ?
yes .
yes .
we &apos;re going to need a new rendezvous for the exchange .
4268 fifth avenue .
4268 fifth avenue .
now .
now .
let &apos;s hope that worked .
larssen ?
not quite .
guess you were expecting someone else .
shoot this man .
hey again .
over there .
go !
told you you shouldn &apos;t bet the chalk .
let &apos;s see what &apos;s so important to larssen &apos;s boss .
cuff yourselves together on the banister .
dinnerware ?
it &apos;s china ...
from the &apos; 30s or &apos; 40s .
this looks like the contents of someone &apos;s house .
what &apos;s so valuable about this stuff ?
i don &apos;t know . i never look in the crates .
definitely the &apos; 40s .
the fbi won &apos;t leave me alone .
they &apos;re looking for your crate , and they &apos;re closing in .
and where is the crate now ?
i got it to a safehouse
before they could find it .
i &apos;m giving you half an hour to move it ,
or i &apos;m delivering it to the fbi myself
and cutting a deal .
calm down . don &apos;t do anything stupid .
this agent burke won &apos;t leave me alone !
peter burke ?
are you sure ?
yes , positive .
okay .
you text me the address ,
and i &apos;ll meet you there immediately .
i know how to solve this .
he &apos;s meeting me there .
sara , you &apos;re up .
excuse me .
i need to speak with the d.o.j. agent
in charge of the burke case .
uh , that &apos;d be agent roe .
agent roe !
hi . sara ellis .
i &apos;m an insurance investigator with sterling bosch .
what can i do for you , miss ellis ?
well , i just got a call from my client ,
and he &apos;s being harassed by agent peter burke .
i &apos;d like to file a complaint .
burke ? you &apos;re sure about this ?
burke &apos;s there right now ,
if you &apos;d like to go see for yourself .
yeah , let &apos;s go .
still think this is a witch hunt ?
i guess we &apos;ll find out .
yeah .
what the hell is going on here ?
peter needs our help .
what are you doing ?
latex fingerprints for agent peter burke .
they find burke &apos;s prints all over the guns .
that &apos;s right .
he planted evidence against me ...
... again .
hands in the air !
i said in the air ! now !
what &apos;s that on his hands ?
jones , check his hands .
latex fingerprints .
i &apos;ll bet they match burke &apos;s .
let &apos;s get the fingerprints into evidence .
can we get a little farther away ?
my nose isn &apos;t bleeding yet .
close enough .
how &apos;s it going ?
we &apos;re about to find out .
there it is .
that there is a sight .
no . no , no , no .
he &apos;s got roe &apos;s gun .
all right , where &apos;s the car ?
two blocks in the wrong direction .

larssen &apos;s got a hard face .
oh , it felt good , though , didn &apos;t it ?
hell , yes , it did .
before you get your badge back ,
there is a seven @-@ man con that i have been meaning to --
no . the burke seven is hereby disbanded .
we made a good team .
oh , come on . admit it -- you enjoyed yourself .
a good con never admits to anything .
oh . you taught me that .
i &apos;m gonna call moz , give him the good news .
hey , moz , we got larssen .
excellent !
i will see your accomplishment and raise you one .
i built our equation .
and ?
you need to come see this .
nice ride back there cowboy .
thank you , ma &apos;am .
yes , sir .
any idea why larssen was so intent
on shipping nazi dinnerware ?
not really . no .
larssen &apos;s not talking ,
but it &apos;s clearly important to whoever he &apos;s working for .
where was it going ?
argentina .
which isn &apos;t exactly in the fbi &apos;s jurisdiction .
it &apos;s in mine .
sterling bosch has a few clients in south america ,
and i have vacation days coming up .
are you offering to go to argentina ?
could be dangerous .
could be fun .
tell junior i &apos;ll send him a postcard .
&quot; junior &quot; ?
we got you a welcome @-@ back gift .
a new mug . look at that .
oh , that &apos;s good .
almost as good as what hughes got me .
it &apos;s great to have you back , boss .
so , what &apos;d you want to show me ?
ta @-@ da !
dejavu .
only this time , it doesn &apos;t end with you walking out a free man .
what &apos;s your offer ?
excuse me ?
i &apos;m the bullet , remember ?
you want the man pulling the trigger .
offer &apos;s expired .
this is what the music box encoded .
now , i know bendy straws aren &apos;t the most elegant medium ,
but they make the point .
it &apos;s a fractal design .
fractals are used in , like , everything
from predicting natural disasters to metallurgy .
there &apos;s one in your cellphone .
moz , i &apos;ve seen something like this before .
i know who &apos;s behind everything .
the only deal i &apos;ll make is to protect you from him .
get him out .
his name is vincent adler .
we both know who he is , moz .
