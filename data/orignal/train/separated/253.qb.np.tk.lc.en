gossip girl here-- your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
can we please turn it off ?
you manipulated me into thinking that it was over
so i would cheat on her ,
and i can &apos;t marry someone who always has another sex tape
or surprise scheme up their sleeve .
you wanna grab a burger ?
so bart was using the horses to hide the money
he was buying illegal oil with ?
he did it so he could avoid federal prison .
lola returned it to me .
that &apos;s carol &apos;s portion of cece &apos;s estate .
i never thought i &apos;d be grateful to cece rhodes .
miss eleanor call . she saw photos of cotillion .
she say she come home to fix decorum disaster .
they say the early bird gets the worm .
inspiring motivation ... if you &apos;re the bird .
the worm , however , has no idea
when her future will be plucked away
by the next airborne attacker .
my mother &apos;s plane landed 45 minutes ago .
look , alive , people !
she was so furious that my cotillion dress was associated
with serena &apos;s sickening sex tape .
everything must be perfect .
and &quot; perfect &quot; does not include tabloid contraband .
hand it over .
get this out of my sight .
my mother cannot see that revenge smut .
on second thought , you go with it .
how dare humphrey write that i am conniving , manipulative ,
and stuck in high school ?
i am not all scheme and no substance .
hell have no fury like a lonely boy scorned .
well , he doesn &apos;t matter .
when my mother sees the dress orders ,
she will be so busy singing my praises
that she won &apos;t have time to pay attention to--
pay attention to what , blair ?
what don &apos;t you want me paying attention to ?
mother ! welcome home !
what is this , &quot; downton abbey &quot; ?
everyone , back to work !
dorota , when did you become a seamstress ?
get my bags ,
take them back to the house and start keeping it .
this is not fooling anyone .
you . office . now .
i know you &apos;re upset , mother ,
but my cotillion dress has already been ordered
by the three b &apos;s--
barneys , bergdorf &apos;s ,
and the lesser but still relevant bloomingdale &apos;s .
i achieved your goal .
at the cost of my company &apos;s reputation .
a few sales do not make up
for a runway strip show and sex tapes ,
and bandage dresses without the--the bandages .
well , i admit a shift in marketing strategy
may be called for .
no , the--the issue goes deeper than that ,
blair . it &apos;s you .
you and your-- your split personality .
well , you must be referring to my ability to multitask .
i am referring to your dark and scheming
and , frankly , sexually inappropriate side .
i like to think of myself as open @-@ minded ?
for as long as i can remember ,
you have struggled between your two natures .
i know that you are a beautiful , intelligent ,
ambitious young businesswoman .
but if you want to continue to run
my multimillion @-@ dollar corporation ,
the deviant half has to go .
for good !
i understand .
there won &apos;t be an issue .
my grace kelly can defeat my grace jones .
后者为以雌雄同体形象著称的牙买加另类歌手
no problem .
well , honestly , i &apos;ve-- i &apos;ve slept so much better
that lola returned the money from cece &apos;s estate to me .
i &apos;m really sorry i kept that a secret from you .
i &apos;m just glad everything &apos;s out in the open
and you had the money to save the gallery in time for tonight &apos;s opening .
i &apos;m so excited it &apos;s finally happening .
are there any last @-@ minute details
you want me to take care of ?
well , we need to give the caterer a final head count .
do you remember how many r.s.v.p. &apos; s we had ?
i never checked , but ...
i &apos;m sure everyone &apos;s coming .
what &apos;s wrong ?
well , this can &apos;t be right .
they &apos;re all regrets .
what happened to your art world connections ?
参加活动 不参加 未回复
no art forum editor .
no major collectors . hey , even bex said &quot; no . &quot;
what the hell happened ?
you surfing the empire cctv again ?
what , is olivia munn staying here ?
wrong place .
this is the security footage from the van der woodsen building .
how &apos;d you get your hands on that ?
well , vanya can &apos;t be bribed , but the night doorman
was remarkably open to a cash payment .
so what are you looking for ?
when ivy was in the apartment ,
she said bart walked in
with an envelope he held on to rather tightly .
i was hoping to see
a return address or some distinguishing marks .
did you find anything ?
indeed .
the envelope had the seal
of the first international bank of sudan .
the financial records from his illegal oil trade ?
i assume so , but bart closed all the accounts that morning .
and he &apos;s not about to show you what &apos;s in the envelope
or tell you where it is .
he won &apos;t , but someone else might .
bruce caplan dropped the envelope off
to bart that morning .
the bass business manager ?
he won &apos;t spill any of bart &apos;s secrets to you .
he won &apos;t , but if the head of &quot; the spectator &quot; were
to ask for business management advice ...
he might accidentally let something slip .
especially if it &apos;s the kind of meeting that loosens lips .
okay .
yeah . thank you .
i figured out why no one &apos;s coming to our opening .
turns out there &apos;s a huge benefit tonight at the conrad
for the art production fund . guess who &apos;s hosting .
lily .
she must &apos;ve figured out
when you were planning on opening your gallery ,
scheduled her own benefit to sabotage you .
it &apos;s not just me she &apos;s sabotaging .
it &apos;s my artists , too .
this group show was a big deal to them .
how am i gonna explain that no one &apos;s coming
because of my vindictive ex @-@ wife ?
everyone would still come if her event was canceled .
she &apos;s not gonna cancel a huge benefit for me .
she won &apos;t even take my call .
i &apos;m not calling her .
i &apos;m calling the art production fund .
i feel like donating some money .
good morning , daniel .
good morning .
thank you for letting me stay in eric &apos;s room .
can i make you and bart a cup ?
no . i &apos;m good , thanks . and bart is out of town .
i &apos;m on my way to via quadronno to meet the girls
before my benefit meeting .
how &apos;s that going , by the way ?
i forgot how much i enjoy throwing a party
without having my husband standing over my shoulder , judging me .
i mean rufus , of course ,
not bart.
forgive me , daniel .
you can never offend me with the truth .
nonfat cappuccino , extra foam , no sugar .
you remembered .
yeah , it &apos;s been a while ,
almost as long as since we woke up
in the same apartment together .
unless you count the waldorfs &apos; . remember ?
i certainly forgot this was coming out today .
yeah . we &apos;ve both burned a lot of bridges this year .
but at least we have each other .
and i couldn &apos;t be more grateful for you letting me camp out ,
but i @-@ i don &apos;t want to overstay my welcome .
i finally got my first paycheck for &quot; vanity fair , &quot;
so i think it &apos;s time for me to find my own place
and let you get back to your life .
yeah . i mean , we can &apos;t hide out here forever .
but , if you--if you need to find a new place ,
i @-@ i know someone who knows everyone ,
who has terrific instincts for real estate ,
and who happens to have an afternoon free
to look at apartments with you .
who ?
right . yeah , that &apos;s you . okay .
so do you have any idea what neighborhood you want ?
i can &apos;t get far enough away from my dad right now ,
so brooklyn &apos;s out .
so upper east side ?
i was--i was thinking lower .
what &apos;s funny about that ?
i know you like the idea
of saying you live in an l.e.s. walk @-@ up ,
but we both know you well enough to know
you secretly long for a condo in the west village .
fine . a doorman would be nice ,
but i &apos;ll just lie about how much rent i pay .
okay , let &apos;s take a cab to west fourth then .
no , we got a ride .
you bought vaespa ?
that &apos;s right . i forgot how much you like vespas .
but i got so used to driving one around italy this summer
that i decided i couldn &apos;t live without .
here . hop on .
serena ! serena !
i loved that sex tape !
serena , serena , over here !
no .
turn around and give me a smile , serena .
when &apos;s the sequel ? talk to us .
spotted-- s. and d. getting cozy again .
even i have to admit they sure look cute on that scooter .
my gosh . that was amazing !
you were-- you were like jason bourne ,
riding up on the sidewalk .
you know , that sex tape-- i knew it went viral ,
but i didn &apos;t expect that .
given the media circus ,
maybe today &apos;s not the day to be searching for apartments .
nobody wants a tenant trailed by tmz .
that &apos;s great . all right , we should probably get off the streets .
yeah . i could use a drink .
you know what ? i know a place
where no one will think to look for us .
perfect .
thank you .
so , bruce , is there anything else i can get you ?
crystal and cristal is my favorite combination .
but maybe we &apos;d better get
to that urgent business matter you mentioned .
there are certain things about &quot; the spectator &quot; finances
i would like to remain confidential .
i wonder if you could advise me
on the safest way to keep those hidden .
storing confidential information is ... a specialty of mine .
but i like to work on a client @-@ by @-@ client basis .
could you give me some examples ?
i &apos;m sorry . my clients depend on my discretion .
besides , i don &apos;t want to talk about that now .
send me your books . i &apos;ll make a recommendation .
in the meantime ,
i ... would like to take the rest of this ... meeting ... elsewhere .
don &apos;t forget your jacket .
thanks .
why did you let him leave without getting the information ?
he wasn &apos;t gonna give it to me ,
so i figured i &apos;d just take it .
i will admit you have taken steps .
like the--the peonies were an elegant addition
to the handwritten apologies you sent
to each of the board members of the cotillion .
and poppy did seem touched by my donation
to her charity for children who can &apos;t smile .
sound like miss blair show great grace and dignity .
yes , that &apos;s right , dorota .
my mother has shown me the errors of my way .
so now you can return to paris ,
reassured that your company &apos;s on the straight and narrow .
let &apos;s not get ahead of ourselves .
i said steps , as in the first of many on the road to recovery .
well , i have already admitted
that i am powerless over my scheme
and that my life has become unmanageable .
what else is there ?
amends to the fashion community which informs the masses .
hello , blair .
i had dorota prepare a light lunch .
i &apos;ll let you girls ... chat .
how could someone who hides everything for everyone else
pick his birthday for his password ?
i underestimated you , nathaniel .
well , you &apos;re not the first person to say that ,
but there &apos;s nothing under the international bank of sudan .
then pull up my father .
bruce said he had different methods
for hiding information for different clients .
maybe there &apos;s a record of it .
there &apos;s nothing here but addresses and phone numbers .
then look at the calendar
the morning he dropped off the envelope .
maybe there &apos;s a clue to where he went .
wait . there &apos;s an entry here from the morning .
it says &quot; bass traffic . &quot;
i &apos;m sorry . we &apos;re not open to the public just yet .
oh , we have an appointment .
rufus humphrey . hi .
this is ivy dickens .
benedict tate .
i &apos;m doing p.r. for tonight &apos;s event .
so please , how can i be of assistance ?
we would like to purchase all of the artwork .
i appreciate your enthusiasm ,
but tonight &apos;s silent auction is expected to raise
hundreds of thousands of dollars .
how many hundreds ?
5 ?
7 ?
you know , 8 has always been a lucky number for me .
so now you can , uh , cancel your expensive party
and send everyone home .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry . i think there &apos;s been a misunderstanding .
i am happy to deliver all the artwork to you
after the event , but it &apos;s too late an hour to cancel .
and , well ...
we need something on the walls .
then i have an idea that may help you raise even more money .
when we came here on our first date ,
下文的法国大餐都是第一季sd初次约会的梗
you didn &apos;t know how to hold the cue .
did you spend the last five years taking billiard lessons ?
i could always play .
you hustled me .
well , no . i @-@ i just wanted to make you feel better
after your epic french ordering failure .
or maybe you were looking for an excuse
for me to put my arms around you .
a girl never reveals her secrets .
unless you &apos;re gossip girl .
spotted--two old flames slumming it on memory lane .
who doesn &apos;t love a sequel ?
did she give our exact location ?
yeah , which means our mob of new friends
are probably already camped outside .
we &apos;re just fueling their fire by being together .
why don &apos;t i go out front with the vespa ?
i &apos;ll distract &apos; em , and you just sneak out back and grab a taxi .
well , we don &apos;t have to go right now .
i &apos;m just about to win .
please . let &apos;s--let &apos;s not make my humiliation official .
and the sooner we get out of here , the better .
this was nice , though . i &apos;ll miss it .
traffic .
traffic jam .
traffic light . maybe they had a meeting in a car .
or it &apos;s bart &apos;s oil trafficking
or something else he &apos;s illegally selling .
like a nuclear bomb in a briefcase .
you watch too many movies .
so does bruce .
wait . that &apos;s it .
the movie &quot; traffic &quot; is right here .
i remember in that film , the head of the drug cartel
stored his illegal account information
in the back of a painting .
what , you think that &apos;s where bart hid
whatever was in the envelope ?
there &apos;s a lot of paintings in the van der woodsen apartment .
i &apos;m just , unfortunately , still banned from the building .
i guess i &apos;ll have to pay them a visit .
so i called and i called and i called and i called ,
and then i just never heard from him again .
is that the end of the story ?
wow . you really are so ... entertaining .
so when my mother returns ,
tell her that i apologized and that we &apos;re best friends .
i &apos;m sorry , blair . this was fun , but i won &apos;t do that
because it &apos;s not the truth .
yes , it is .
no , it &apos;s not .
yes , it is .
no , it &apos;s not .
yes , it is .
no , it &apos;s not .
i have been cordial to you for the last ... 52 minutes .
do you have any idea
the psychological torture that i have endured being nice to you ?
i should have just skipped ahead to this from the start .
it that me as mrs. mingott in a fat suit ?
that was embarrassing .
agreed , which is why you don &apos;t want this
bouncing around the blogosphere .
no one wants to take fashion advice from her .
mother !
ladies , how are we getting along ?
famously .
blair just tried to blackmail me .
i &apos;m sorry , eleanor . i tried .
this is all nelly &apos;s fault .
she was clearly lying because she &apos;s always been jealous of me .
the only thing clear
is that daniel humphrey was right about you .
you read that dreck ?
on the plane .
and his--his central thesis is correct .
you are running my business
like you &apos;re still the meanest girl in high school .
i am trying .
relapse is part of recovery .
please , just give me one more chance .
i &apos;m sorry , blair . it &apos;s over . i can &apos;t .
i have no other choice but to demote you
and take back the presidency of waldorf designs ,
effective immediately .
watch out , b.
they say you &apos;re only as good as the company you keep ,
and right now you &apos;re not keeping any .
what &apos;s going on ?
why are you taking down the paintings for my event ?
i think you mean our event .
since everyone in the art world is coming here tonight
instead of my gallery opening ,
i decided to have my opening here .
that &apos;s outrageous . i &apos;m gonna talk to benedict
and have him reinstall my art immediately .
well , that would be difficult since we own it all now .
lily , welcome .
i see you &apos;ve met our new event co @-@ sponsors .
i have ,
and i &apos;m not thrilled
that my carefully curated pieces are being replaced
without even so much as a phone call .
well , i &apos;m sorry .
i never imagined that you &apos;d object
to raising more money for such a worthwhile cause .
lily , rufus and ivy have helped a.p.f.
break fund @-@ raising records .
certainly , sharing your hosting duties
is a @-@ a small price to pay .
of course ,
which is why you &apos;ve inspired me to make my own additional donation ,
which i am sure will break their record .
丹 · 汉弗瑞
hold it right there , humph @-@ freak !
do you have any idea what a mess your article has made ?
no , but i &apos;m guessing you &apos;re gonna tell me
even if i keep walking .
my mother dted me , thanks to your disparaging drivel .
right , and i &apos;m sure it had nothing to do
with your work @-@ related behavior .
fix this ,
or when i &apos;m done with you ,
you won &apos;t even have georgina sparks &apos; couch in brooklyn .
i will fly vanessa back
from whatever third @-@ world country she &apos;s in if i have to .
do you hear yourself ?
you &apos;re trying to bully me
into retracting an article about you being a bully .
no .
i &apos;m proving to my mother
that i am the mature , polite , professional woman
who should be running waldorf designs .
blair , you tracked me down with your &quot; spotted &quot; map
and threatened me with the return of vanessa .
you are not mature , polite , or professional ,
and even your own mother knows it .
nelly ?
do you think you could meet me at lily &apos;s benefit tonight ?
there &apos;s something i think you would want to hear .
and you &apos;re sure there &apos;s nothing ?
there &apos;s nothing in any of this art .
it could be subtle .
tape on the backing or rip in the seam .
no , there &apos;s nothing .
and the back of artwork is really boring .
hold on one second .
someone &apos;s coming .
nate ? what are you doing here ?
i am just writing a story on lily &apos;s artwork
for &quot; the spectator . &quot;
oh , for the a.p.f. benefit tonight ?
yeah . exactly .
what are you up to ?
uh , just rereading an old short story .
hey , is everybody a writer these days ?
it--no , it &apos;s dan &apos;s .
wow . aren &apos;t you getting enough of him in &quot; vanity fair &quot; ?
it &apos;s the one from &quot; the new yorker . &quot;
you know , the story about the first time he saw me at that party .
do not tell me in some twisted turn of events
that sex tape made you miss him .
no , it &apos;s just ...
we spent some time together ,
and ... i don &apos;t know . it-- it brought up some old memories .
serena , you &apos;re really vulnerable right now
after steven broke up with you .
it &apos;s too soon to have real feelings for dan .
but what if those feelings never really went away ?
that high school kid you fell in love with--
that &apos;s not who he is anymore , okay ?
he almost cost me &quot; the spectator &quot; to sell his serial .
and he exploited all of us in those chapters .
i know . you &apos;re right .
i mean , he has become a selfish egomaniac who will ...
serena--
destroy his friends for--for money and attention ,
for fame and--
i know how much you like chocolate @-@ covered strawberries .
dan , wait .
hey , listen , i better get going .
wait . what about the auction serena mentioned ?
look around . is there anything missing ?
that painting of the rainbow woman is gone .
oh . my richard phillips has arrived .
lily , are you sure ?
you know , it &apos;s one of my favorite pieces in my collection ,
but it is for a good cause .
and i &apos;ve already sent bart an e @-@ mail ,
and i know he will agree .
this is incredibly generous .
in fact , we &apos;re gonna have a live auction
just for this special piece .
i know she will be the star of the show .
this work of art appears to be a work of bart.
let the bidding begin .
this is spencer sweeney , patrick mcmullan ,
and fab five freddy .
good evening , ladies and gentlemen ,
and welcome to the art production fund benefit .
first , i &apos;d like to say a special thanks
to rufus humphrey and ivy dickens
for their tremendous contribution tonight .
careful , lily .
you paid a lot of money to fill those worry lines .
listen , you vile little interloper ,
you and rufus may have rubbed
your last two nickels together to replace my art ,
but the only people that you &apos;re making fools of are yourselves .
but tonight , folks , the centerpiece of this event
will be a special live auction
of richard phillips &apos; &quot; spectrum , &quot;
courtesy of lilian bass &apos; personal collection .
bidding will begin shortly .
as i was saying , you can pretend to be lola ,
you can pretend to be serena ,
but you will never be me .
i don &apos;t want to be you . i want to be better .
rufus already thinks i am .
i always liked that painting .
i &apos;m glad to see you two found each other .
blair .
nelly was just telling me you invited her here
to meet with her .
i hope it is to make an official apology .
that i &apos;d love to hear .
i &apos;m not here to apologize to nelly , mother .
i &apos;m here to apologize to you .
then what am i doing here ?
shutting up and writing about it so you can publicly restore
waldorf designs &apos; pristine reputation .
blair , what is this about ?
undoing all the damage my dark side has done .
i &apos;m a bad seed , mother .
so send me away to the village of the damned .
no one expects miracles , darling .
it &apos;s been part of you for 20 @-@ something years .
it &apos;s not going to go away overnight .
just maybe sometime before i die .
y @-@ you don &apos;t understand .
the real grace kelly had talent .
you have talent .
even that goth princess jenny humphrey had talent .
but i don &apos;t . it &apos;s all just pretense .
well , your record of achievements prove otherwise .
everything i have
was from scheming and lying
and working the angles .
i don &apos;t have what it takes .
you are mozart .
i &apos;m salieri .
no matter how hard i work , i will never be you .
and i think it was just my dark side trying to hide that .
so ...
effective immediately ,
i resign from waldorf designs .
did you reach anyone from a.p.f. ?
i finally got ahold of an assistant ,
but she said they &apos;re only taking bids in person .
how far away are you ?
at least ten blocks .
is there no way around this , like on the sidewalk ?
i like that your artists reflect
the same socially relevant projects
we commission at art production fund .
and i like that you can see the street art influence .
i &apos;m not talking about the &apos; 80s but the &apos; 40s--
dubuffet , pollack , ray johnson .
yeah , when artists were the stars of new york
instead of celebutantes .
yes .
excuse me . can i speak to you for a moment ?
what can i do for you , lily ?
are you interested in one of my pfahler pieces
to replace your phillips ?
no , thank you .
and i think you &apos;ve made your point here , rufus .
this is a benefit to raise money for a good cause ,
and i won &apos;t have your little freeloader making a mockery of it
by bidding on things she can &apos;t afford .
ivy can afford any painting she wants .
and with what money ? i know it &apos;s not yours .
you &apos;re right .
it &apos;s cece &apos;s .
ladies and gentlemen ,
if we are ready to begin ,
i would like to start the bidding
for the richard phillips
at $ 500,000 .
$ 500,000 .
i have $ 500,000 .
lola gave it back to her when she found out
your mother wanted ivy to have it .
$ 500,000 . going once ?
$ 500,000 . do i have $ 520,000 ?
$ 520,000 .
she may have been able to con lola out of half my mother &apos;s estate ,
but she &apos;ll never get anything of mine .
do i have $ 540,000 ? going once ?
$ 540,000 .
$ 560,000 .
$ 560,000 . do i have $ 570,000 ?
$ 570,000 .
$ 570,000 . $ 570,000 . do i have $ 580,000 ?
$ 580,000 .
$ 580,000 . do i have $ 600,000 ?
$ 750,000 .
$ 750,000 .
i know it sounded bad , but you heard it out of context .
in what context can &quot; selfish egomaniac &quot; be positive ?
i was telling nate what a good time i had with you ,
but th--
yeah , i heard the &quot; but &quot; part .
but that it &apos;s confusing for me
because i have spent the past few months hating you .
i told you i loved you ,
and then you rejected me for my best friend .
you &apos;ve rejected me for nearly everyone on the upper east side .
can you blame me for having doubts ?
you had more than doubts .
you told me you never wanted to see me again .
you mean , after you used me to make a sex tape
to destroy me and your best friend ?
i &apos;m not the bad guy here .
you want everyone to believe
you &apos;re poor , sweet dan humphrey from brooklyn .
but you sent that video of chuck and blair
into &quot; gossip girl &quot;
to try to ruin her wedding , and then you pinned it on me .
yeah , i didn &apos;t want blair to marry the wrong man .
and it &apos;s not like you &apos;ve never used &quot; gossip girl &quot;
to further your own agenda .
oh , wait . oh , wait . you were gossip girl for a second .
only to restore balance after georgina &apos;s reign of terror--
who--who is now partnering with you to attack and humiliate
everyone that we care about in your exposes ?
which leads us back to your reason
for calling me a selfish egomaniac .
you &apos;re right . now i--now i understand .
good . i &apos;m glad .
i was being sarcastic , serena .
so was i.
no , you weren &apos;t .
yes , i was .
look--look ,
obviously , too much has happened over the past five years .
no matter who we are today ,
we can &apos;t undo the things we &apos;ve done in the past ,
so it &apos;s probably best we just move on without each other .
which i will do the second we get out of this elevator .
$ 880,000 . i have $ 880,000 . do i hear $ 900,000 ?
$ 900,000 .
$ 900,000 .
what do you think you &apos;re doing ?
$ 920,000 .
i &apos;d ask you the same thing .
bidding on an item you put up for auction ?
i changed my mind when this gypsy trash wanted it .
she will not have anything near and dear to my heart .
$ 940,000 once ?
$ 940,000 .
$ 960,000 .
i assure you i won &apos;t let her win if you stop bidding .
and why should i trust you ?
i know you teamed up with this charlatan
to cause problems with your father and me .
this painting means more to me than anything .
$ 980,000 .
what do you think you &apos;re doing ?
we &apos;re supposed to be on the same side .
so you are still aligned with her ?
i &apos;m on nobody &apos;s side but my own .
$ 1.1 million .
do i hear 1.2 ?
going once . going twice .
sold for $ 1.1 million .
to the man in front .
congratulations .
revenge is sweet ,
especially when you have a sugar mama .
unfortunately ,
not all families appreciate just desserts .
i just wanted to congratulate you and apologize .
i admit that i was out of line
with some of the things that i said earlier .
and you obviously want something now .
well , i know how important it was for you to prove
that you could best me publicly .
and now that you &apos;ve achieved what you wanted ,
i would love to buy my painting back .
well , if you wanted it so much , why &apos;d you put it up for auction ?
i had no idea how much it meant to me till it was gone .
and let &apos;s face it , rufus .
do you really want that hanging in your loft ,
reminding you of me ?
i don &apos;t .
we &apos;ll give it to a museum--
one far away from manhattan
where you won &apos;t even be able to visit .
surely there &apos;s a price that will change your mind .
no .
you can &apos;t buy us off the way you do everyone else .
we don &apos;t want your money .
what is it you want then ?
to make you feel the way you &apos;ve made us feel--
humiliated and powerless
and like you &apos;re worth nothing .
so if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
i &apos;m going to make sure they &apos;re packing up our painting .
i &apos;ll see you later .
and you remain a kept man .
i never thought i would say this , lily ,
but i think ivy &apos;s right .
you brought this on yourself .
maybe you should try vanya again .
it &apos;s been , like , 47 seconds since i called .
and unlike last time we were stuck here ,
i remembered to use your name .
oh , if we &apos;re recreating that ,
you should probably try to crawl out of the ceiling any moment .
i admit that was not one of my better ideas .
why--why were you so mad about it , then ?
because i didn &apos;t want you to get hurt .
i &apos;m sure you want me to hit the floor right now .
throw me down the elevator shaft .
or , hell , you know , you could just
trick me into making another sex tape .
it &apos;s the people you know best that you can hurt the most .
i &apos;m sorry ...
i didn &apos;t say anything when you told me you loved me .
it--it was easier to focus on my anger at blair
than face the possibility of getting what i always wanted
and ... and--and losing it again .
what you always wanted ?
you know , i had ...
a really great time with you today .
i had to believe that you were terrible
in order to protect myself .
well , you know , i could actually be terrible if you prefer .
no . no , thank you . i &apos;m good .
i @-@ i much prefer you this way .
yeah , the feeling &apos;s mutual .
i will try vanya again .
well ...
i guess that &apos;s my cue .
or you could come up
and have some chocolate @-@ covered strawberries
before you face the paparazzi .
yeah . that sounds nice .
if you &apos;ve come for a follow @-@ up interview , i have no comment .
actually , i came to say thanks for the exclusive ...
and maybe to gloat a little .
how did you know where to find me ?
b高中辉煌时最喜欢坐的台阶
the met steps ?
where else would you go to make yourself feel better ?
my mother always said you &apos;d peaked in high school .
you mean when no one else spoke to you besides your mother ?
you can make fun of how unpopular i used to be ,
but the person no one cares about anymore is you .
then why are you still sitting below me on the steps ?
habit . like a headband .
just a remnant from when you were a tastemaker .
and all every girl at constance wanted was to be just like me .
lucky for all of us , like the eco @-@ clothing trend ,
those days are gone .
you obviously don &apos;t shop in brooklyn .
but thank you , nelly .
your misinformation has been invaluable .
where are you going ? you won &apos;t look good in hemp .
but you will , while you eat crow .
i just hope it &apos;s not too late .
thank you so much
for letting us use your painting in the auction .
um , tood diciurcio ,
this is chuck bass .
it &apos;s a beautiful painting . excuse us .
great work tonight .
no thanks to you .
i thought we were on the same team .
we are , which is why you should sell me that painting .
lily already tried that .
i hope you turned her down .
that piece is a critical component of my campaign against bart.
as you know , if i topple him , lily won &apos;t be far behind .
what &apos;s a queen without her king ?
i &apos;ll sell you the painting ...
for double what i paid .
that &apos;s a price i &apos;m willing to pay .
all right , i &apos;ll have it delivered .
pleasure doing business with you .
spotted--ivy moonlighting as a gallerina .
better hope this masterpiece isn &apos;t a forgery .
is it weird to say i &apos;m-- i &apos;m glad we got in that fight ?
no , no . no , not at all . i am , too .
that storage unit i kept packed full of old resentments
was getting pretty full .
you know , i @-@ i feel like i did
when i first came back to the city from boarding school ,
when all i wanted was a fresh start .
well , you have one now , at least with me .
i , uh , should probably take off . it &apos;s getting pretty late .
oh , did you ever find a place ?
technically , no . but , i mean , i got that check now , so ...
i can afford a hotel room . i don &apos;t want to impose too much .
no , you &apos;re-- you &apos;re not imposing at all .
are you sure ? i mean , just this morning ,
you were saying you thought it might ruin our friendship .
well , i think if we could get through the last five years ,
then we could get through a few more nights .
so ... y @-@ you can stay .
or you don &apos;t have to .
you can go , too .
or you can stay . whatever you want .
that &apos;s what i want .
i made a mistake .
many . who hasn &apos;t ?
you &apos;ll have to be more specific , dear .
when i quit earlier ,
i thought that i was using my dark side
to hide the fact that i have no talent .
i wasn &apos;t the one who said you didn &apos;t have talent , blair .
no , but you told me to squash my dark side ,
which is my talent . it &apos;s my inspiration .
you can &apos;t blackmail your way through business .
well , i agree , but ...
i &apos;m not talking about my management style ,
which i admit needs help to stay on the straight and narrow .
i &apos;m talking about my designs .
oh , where is this coming from ?
high school .
my grace kelly did have talent .
she got me straight a &apos;s and the perfect boyfriend .
but it was my grace jones
that had everyone wanting to dress like me ,
not because they admired my hard work
but because they were fascinated by my ferocity .
you did instill fear in the hearts of many .
i need to stop trying to be you and use my power
to form the fashionistas of the future ...
with a line for high school girls ,
inspired by my constance uniform .
i &apos;m not sure people want to wear uniforms
if they &apos;re not in school .
these won &apos;t be the uniforms they have to wear .
they &apos;ll be the uniforms they beg to wear--
once they see on the girls they want to be .
they own this town .
uniforms ?
well , they do represent power and authority
and instill a sense of belonging .
and the girls i dress won &apos;t follow trends .
they will set them ,
just like i did .
you always were very influential .
please .
give me one more chance to prove it .
so what do you expect to find ?
the financial records of bart &apos;s oil deal ,
which , when i finally hand over to the fbi ,
will ensure he spends the rest of his days
playing pinochle with bernie madoff .
thank you .
well , i guess it &apos;s not time to break out the handcuffs just yet .
where the hell is that envelope ?
maybe &quot; traffic &quot; meant something else
or we got the wrong painting .
no . no . lily was too determined to get this one ,
and the phillips in my bedroom has a backing on it .
then someone took it off .
then they &apos;ve got the evidence !
remember that silver bullet we were looking for ?
i found it .
you know , i really think it &apos;s time for you to come back .
the sooner , the better .
i don &apos;t know how much longer i can keep doing this .
i gotta go .
one pepperoni pizza , extra cheese to go
with a bottle of dom perignon--
an unexpected yet brilliant combination ,
just like us .
the beatles sang ,
&quot; living is easy with eyes closed . &quot;
bart , i am so sorry .
i had no idea that &apos;s where you hid the records of your oil deals .
but even with our eyes open ,
we all still have blind spots .
or maybe we &apos;re just looking in the wrong place .
so this will be aimed at the 12 @-@ to @-@ 25 set .
marc jacobs has &quot; marc by ... &quot;
mm @-@ hmm . and waldorf designs will have &quot; b. &quot;
oh , i just love that .
yeah !
but when we finally do see the light ,
it &apos;s strawberry fields forever .
wait a second .
are you sure ?
x.o.x.o. , gossip girl .
