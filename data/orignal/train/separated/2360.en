You must be Elena.
How do we look exactly alike?
Because you're a Petrova doppelganger.
You're the key to breaking the curse.
The sun and the moon curse?
Klaus is the real deal.
From the first generation of vampires.
The oldest vampire in the history of time
is coming after me?
Elijah. One of the originals.
He's a legend.
I'm prepared to offer you a deal.
What kind of a deal?
You and I shall drop out
and I shall make certain your friends remain unharmed.
And then what?
Then I kill him.
Take me far, far away.
Where would you like to go?
These must be the other Jonathon Gilbert journals.
I come bearing gifts. This is how you kill an original.
That ring Isobel gave you.
That's mine. I'm gonna want that back.
Did he ever tell you what happened to his wife?
What are you saying?
Why don't you ask Rick?
How will you kill Klaus?
After the sacrifice.
After the sacrifice?
Elena has to die.
You knew that you weren't going to survive this?
If it comes down to the people that I love
getting killed and me, I know what my choice is going to be.
You're being a martyr.
That's not heroic. It's tragic.
With the dying embers of the fire
at Fell's church, the scourge of the vampires had passed.
And though war raged all around us,
our town was safe from the demons of the night...
or so we thought.
For the monsters we drove to their fiery deaths
had beget new monsters.
Did you hear that?
Stay here.
No, Thomas.
It's all right, dear, the vampires are all dead.
Yes, Honoria,
they burned in the church. We're safe now.
Please, Jonathon. I'm worried.
Very well. I shall go, too.
I can prove there are no vampires.
See.
Thomas?
Thomas?
Thomas!
No, stay inside! Get back in the house!
No!
I knew I was about to die.
You can not run from a vampire.
I saw the vampire who killed me.
I recognized him.
Stefan Salvatore.
What's going on?
Well, I showered. I shaved.
Had breakfast. Very relaxed.
That makes one of us.
I did hear one piece of good news though.
Tyler Lockwood ran away from home last night.
How do you know?
Well, I heard it from sheriff Forbes,
who heard it from a very distraught Carol Lockwood,
thus, ending our werewolf chapter,
bringing us to...
Killing Elijah.
Exactly.
Well, it's not going to be easy. He's crafty.
Well, I've got a crafty little dagger.
He's an original. We don't know what all that encompasses.
Oh, trust me, Stefan.
I'm gonna dot all my t's. I don't want any surprises.
Wow, Damon, tell me you're actually gonna be careful for once.
Yes, Stefan, I've become you.
How tragic for both of us.
Got to run. I've a murder to plan.
Busy day.
The old Fell property actually starts just beyond that fence.
Ah, the Fells. One of the "Founding families."
Why do you say it like that?
My research showed me that this area was actually settled
almost two full centuries earlier.
It was a migration of townsfolk from the northeast,
um, it was Salem, to be precise.
Massachusetts? As in the witch trials?
Which means the ever lauded founding families...
they didn't actually found anything.
Well, I bet it was the men who made a big deal
about being founders back in 1860.
Men are very territorial.
Yes, they are.
Elijah, this is my friend, Alaric Saltzman.
Yeah, I got your message about walking Elijah here
through the old property lines.
I thought I would tag along.
You know being a history buff and all.
Where to next?
I'm pretty curious about the freed slave property owners.
Some say, you know, the descendents of the slaves
are the true keepers of American history.
Well, I only brought the surveys.
I got the list in the car just give me a sec.
Alaric Saltzman.
So you're one of those people
on Elena's list of loved ones to protect.
So is Jenna.
You don't have to be jealous.
I don't really pursue younger women.
It's a joke, Ric, lighten up.
Right.
Hey, whatcha doin'?
Thinking about last night.
Yeah, yeah. Me, too.
It was a tough spell.
I could feel it draining me. I need practice.
Yeah, well, uh, maybe, I don't know.
Maybe you should come over tonight.
We can practice. Get stronger.
Yeah, sure. Thanks.
Ah, incoming.
You want to tell me what the hell happened yesterday?
Sorry?
Don't play dumb. You both were here and...
And?
And that's all I remember.
One minute I'm playing pool
and the next I'm waking up in a bathroom stall.
Sorry, Luka, but everything seemed normal yesterday.
I brought you a coffee and we played pool.
See, I think you're lying.
And I think you need to back off.
Are you still mad?
Yeah, I'm still mad.
We had a difference of opinion, Stefan,
we're not always gonna agree on everything.
Elena, you've agreed to sacrifice yourself to klaus.
To say that we have a difference of opinion
is the understatement of the century.
You would know.
What does Jonathan Gilbert have to say?
A lot.
It's insane the things he wrote in his journal
that he kept from the founding families.
Stuff that nobody knows. Stuff that...
You never told me.
We were, uh...
We were angry at the founding families
for what they did to Katherine.
We wanted revenge.
I didn't know about Jonathan Gilbert's ring yet.
I didn't know that he would... that he would survive.
He describes you as a monster.
That's what I was.
I want you to know the truth...
but I want you to hear it from me.
In the weeks after I became a vampire,
I relished in it.
I took it to the darkest place I could.
Who wants to die next?
Me, I'm next.
Me, you promised me.
What about you?
You know if you don't pick up the tempo,
you're going to lose your head. Snap. Snap.
Company, brother?
I brought enough to share.
Are you mad bringing them here
when the entire town is hunting us?
Damon, if you're worried about the founding families,
please don't be.
They're all dead or about to be.
Leave this place. Never think of it again.
Same for you. Leave this place.
Never think of it again.
Damon, don't be like this.
I'm just having some fun.
Staying alive is more fun, Stefan.
We have to be more careful than this.
More clever. Like Katherine was.
Look what that got her.
I'm done here.
With you.
I'm leaving town.
You hate me. I know. I know.
An eternity of misery and on and on.
But you don't have to leave town.
Damon, I'll do better. I promise.
No, you will get us killed.
I'd rather leave you to do that to yourself.
I wasn't myself then.
I was full of guilt. What I did to my father,
to my brother. I had to turn it off.
It was the only way I could survive.
It sounds like you were Damon.
I was worse.
Other than the lecture on the history of mystic falls,
did you get anything out of Elijah?
No, it was boring.
Of course, Jenna thinks he's charming.
You sounded jealous. Sound a bit jealous?
Kinda do.
Maybe we shouldn't talk about this here.
Andie, she's been compelled
not to divulge my secrets. Haven't you?
Mmm. My lips are sealed.
This is too weird.
I just need the right opportunity.
Ah, there's jenna with her new boyfriend.
So I hear you two had quite a meeting
of historical minds today.
Yeah, I guess you could say that.
Well, as much as I'd love to continue this,
I've got papers to grade.
No, you know what? We should continue this.
Let's have a dinner party.
Ooh, my girl. Full of good ideas.
I'll be happy to host.
Say tonight. Maybe?
It's good for me. Jenna?
I don't know if tonight works--
I'm free.
It'd be a pleasure.
Great.
Drink up.
Good girl.
I've come bearing gifts.
I didn't have time to properly shop,
but I did get a couple of things. Hmm?
Wow, that blood did the trick.
You're almost pretty again.
What is it you want, damon?
Guess who's back in town?
Your old friend, John Gilbert.
Really. Why?
Says he loves his daughter.
Wants to protect her from Elijah and big, bad Klaus.
Touching.
Yeah, right.
He told me this old wives tale
about how to kill an original.
And you want to know if it's true.
If it was, I wouldn't tell you.
Now, why not? I mean, you want Elijah and Klaus
dead as much as I do.
Klaus, yes. Elijah, no.
He's compelled me to stay in here.
If he dies, I'm stuck forever.
Sucks for you.
Forget it, damon.
Killing Elijah would be a suicide mission.
You can't do it.
Can so.
Can't.
Even with a dagger and a little white oak ash?
No. Damon, if you kill Elijah,
then I'm stuck in here forever.
You're really scared.
Just get me out of here first
and then I'll help you.
I'll--I'll help you kill Eljah
or--or protect Elena. Whatever you want.
I get you out of here and your ass
is sipping Klaus-free margaritas
on some unknown island somewhere. No way.
That's not true. I'll stay.
Damon, please just don't do it.
Well, thank you, you've told me everything I need to know.
I've told you nothing.
You have. You have indeed confirmed
that it is possible to kill an original,
which I will do tonight.
Guess who's coming to dinner?
For weeks I kept spiraling.
I was completely driven by the desire for blood.
Hunt, prey, kill.
That was all I knew.
How come no one caught on to what you were doing?
Mmm. There was a war going on.
The thing about wartime.
Endless, anonymous blood supply.
What kind of an idiot are you?
Alexia Branson, as she was known back then.
Lexi? Your best friend Lexi?
That's how you met her?
What was she even doing in mystic falls?
She had heard it was a good place for vampires.
You know, had no idea that they'd all been massacred.
Needed a place to crash, so I brought her home with me.
I'd say it isn't necessary to take me in,
but you did try to eat me, and well, with dawn coming,
beggars can't be choosers.
Or should they be?
I, um...I meant to dispose of those.
My god, you're a ripper.
A what?
There are good parts of being a vampire
and there are bad parts.
You're the bad parts.
Well...we're going to have to change that.
You ok?
Talking about her brings up things I'd rather forget.
Like damon killing her?
So what's going on with you and Alaric?
I feel like there's some tension.
I don't know.
I really like him.
It's more than like
and I want it to work,
but I can't help but feel that he's hiding
something from me. And then I've got John
whispering things in my ear about him.
Like what?
Things I don't want to believe.
Things I don't believe,
not if they're coming from John's mouth.
Oh. Well, there you go, then.
Trust is the key to any relationship.
I mean, I am so grateful that Damon tells me everything.
This is a bad idea.
There's no such thing as a bad idea.
Just poorly executed awesome ones. Here.
No. I don't like the idea of Elijah being
in the same house with Jenna.
Jenna's perfectly safe.
Besides, it's just a fact-finding mission.
It's totally harmless.
Just a fact-finding mission.
Yeah.
Listen, no sneak attacks. No surprise plans.
Nothing that's gonna put Jenna in harm's way. Ok?
Scout's honor.
Hey, Jenna needs help with the wine.
Thanks.
Yeah.
Ok.
What's that?
Dessert.
Elijah's stronger than me.
Faster than me.
It's all about the element of surprise.
Ah, it's too bad. I like him. He's very old-school. Classy.
Which is why you should encourage the gentlemen
to take their after dinner drinks in here
while you do coffee in in the kitchen with the girls.
Hmm. That is a little too sexist for me.
Stop talking.
Who invited him?
John. Surprise. Leave.
When Jenna told me she was coming to a dinner party
for elijah, I decided I
couldn't miss out on all the fun and games.
There are not going to be any games tonight,
John. It's just a friendly dinner party.
What he said.
Thanks.
That thing weighs a ton.
I'm starving. You guys have any...food?
Oh, god. Heh! This is a date.
No, no it's not like a date, date.
More of a hey, I kissed you,
and I thought you liked it, um...hang thing.
Jeremy, I need to make sure Elena is cool with this
before anything else happens.
I didn't realize my sister had approval over who I'm with.
She's my best friend. I tell her everything.
And this whole hang thing might freak her out.
All right, all right, so we'll, um...
we'll hang out, eat some food,
work on some spells.
It's not a big deal.
But you did... you did like it, right?
Yeah. I liked it.
Good evening.
Thank you for coming. Please, come in.
Just one moment.
Can I just say that if you have anything less
than honorable intentions about how this evening is going
to proceed, I suggest you reconsider.
No, nothing, nothing dishonorable.
Just getting to know you.
Well, that's good. Because, you know,
although Elena and I have this deal,
if you so much as make a move to cross me,
I'll kill you and I'll kill everyone in this house. Are we clear?
Crystal.
Jenna. Wonderful to see you again.
How are you?
Nice to see you.
You look incredible.
Thank you.
I hate to break it to you, Damon,
but according to Elijah,
your family is so not a founder of this town.
Do tell.
Well, as I mentioned to Jenna earlier,
a faction of settlers migrated from Salem
after the witch trials in the 1690s.
Over the next hundred years they developed this community
where they could feel safe from persecution.
Because they were witches.
Yeah, but there's no tangible proof
there were witches in Salem.
Andie's a journalist. Big on facts.
Well, the lore says that there was this wave of anti-witch hysteria.
It broke out in the neighboring settlement,
so these witches were rounded up.
They were tied to stakes in a field together
and, uh, burned.
Some say you could hear the screams from miles around us.
They were consumed by the fire. Could you pass the...
I wouldn't repeat this to the historical society.
It's starting to sound a little like a ghost story to me.
So why do you want to know
the location of these alleged massacres?
You know... a healthy historian's curiosity, of course.
Of course.
Jonathan Gilbert got crazier and crazier.
I guess that's what happens
when you spend your life obsessed with vampires.
He researched the originals.
You're kidding.
Later in life. Look.
Pages and pages of questions and scribbles.
What's that?
"The wood from one tree and one tree alone,"
"an ancient white oak would bring death to an original vampire."
"When the tree burned, all hope was thought lost."
He was trying to figure out how to kill an original.
"But the ash from the tree was saved,"
"and witches forged a dagger to which the ash could be bonded."
"This alchemic bond provides the necessary poison."
Elena.
I wonder if this is true.
I mean, do you think this dagger actually exists?
I know it does...
Because John gave it to Damon.
John gave Damon the weapon that's supposed to kill Elijah?
This one?
"It must be brandished by humans alone, "
"for it will bring death to all demons who wield it."
John's trying to get Damon killed.
Does anyone care for some cognac?
I have a bottle I've been saving for ages.
None for me thanks. 9 bottles of wine is my limit.
Why is your phone off? Call me.
What's going on, Atefan?
Damon is planning on killing Elijah.
Tonight.
The gentlemen should take their drinks in the study.
I have to say the food was almost as wonderful as the company.
I like you.
Here you are, gentleman, make yourself useful. Hmm?
Here, here. Put me to work.
Um, I got it.
Hey, Jenna, are you-- are you OK?
Yeah, fine, Ric.
I suspect this is my fault.
What did you do now?
I merely mentioned you haven't been completely honest
with her about your dead wife.
You son of bitch.
I think I've been very clear with you, Ric.
I want my ring back.
Hello. Slow down. Slow down.
Stefan?
So, let me guess. In addition to the moonstone,
the doppelganger, the lion,
the witch and the wardrobe,
you need to find this witch burial ground.
Because I feel as though we've grown so close, Damon,
I'll tell you yes.
Do you know where it is?
Maybe.
Tell me why it's so important.
We're not that close.
It's quite a collection you have here.
It's a funny thing about books.
Before they existed, people actually had memories.
Gentlemen, we forgot about dessert.
Elijah?
Miss Star.
Sorry, guys, dessert is taking longer than I thought.
I usually just unwrap food.
So...I know this is a social thing,
but I...I would really love to ask you some more questions
about the work that you're doing here.
I'd love to answer.
Great. Oh, that's so great.
Ric, would you do me a favor and grab the notebook out of my bag?
Elijah, did John tell you
he's Elena's uncle/father?
Yes, I'm well aware of that.
Of course, she hates him, so there's absolutely no need
to keep him on the endangered species list.
Ric, it's in the front pocket.
On the--you know what? Excuse me, guys. Sorry.
What I'd like to know, Elijah,
is how do you intend on killing Klaus?
Gentlemen, there's a few things
we should probably get clear right now.
I allow you to live solely to keep an eye on Elena.
I allow Elena to remain in her house
living her life with her friends as she does
as a courtesy. If you become a liability,
I'll take her away from you and you'll never see her again.
Ok.
My first question is when you got here to Mystic...
Now, get rid of him before Jenna comes back with dessert.
All right.
Elena, we need to talk about this.
What good is talking if you and Damon are just gonna lie to me?
If you don't like my decisions, that's fine.
There's nothing I can do about that,
but if you ever go behind my back again, I'll--
You're gonna what? Hmm? What are you gonna do, Elena?
It's my life.
Yeah, exactly.
It's your life and I'm gonna do everything I can
to make sure that you live it.
Then what? This--this-- this trip through the past.
You being honest. Was there any truth to that
or were you just distracting me?
I was telling you about a time when I thought everything was lost.
When I had given up because that's exactly what you're doing right now.
That is not what--
Yes, it is. Even if you don't want to admit it.
You are giving up. And Lexi,
she wouldn't let me give up.
I'm not gonna let you.
All of these men are dead or dying.
What does that make you feel?
Nothing. I feel nothing.
Because you shut out the part of you that was human.
The part that lets you feel.
Is that not the point?
Well, there is a better way. You simply have to want it.
Is it better?
Not at first. You can't choose what you feel.
You have to let it all back in.
The pain and the look in their eyes
when you took their life.
The cries of their loved ones.
Why would I want to do that? Hmm?
Because once you can hurt, you can love.
Love, Stefan.
That's the point.
Everything is intensified when you're a vampire.
When we hurt, we really hurt.
But when we love...
Lexi showed me that there was another way.
And from that day forward, I started fighting for it.
For my own survival.
That's all I want you to do.
I just want you to fight for it.
Now, you said there wasn't going to be any violence.
Says the guy that did all the killing.
Hey, I took the shot because I saw an opening,
not because I planned to do this with Jenna in the house.
Now, you can't lie to me like that.
Hey, I am your friend, Damon.
And you don't have any friends.
So, no more lying.
Elijah's dead.
Alaric did it.
Originals believed in truth and honor.
It was forbidden for a vampire to kill another vampire.
So, the dagger would take both lives.
And as long as the dagger stays in place,
the original, for all intents and purposes, is dead.
What happened?
I need you to find Elena.
Now.
Now that is cool. How does it work?
It's called channeling.
Siphoning power from something--
Another witch... The moon, an elephant.
So, technically, you could channel me.
What?
Well, I'm an element, sort of.
I mean, isn't--isn't the human body mostly water?
You're right.
That's... That's what happens.
What the hell are you doing here?
Jeremy!
What did my son tell you?
What did he tell you?
He told me about your daughter.
I know klaus has her
and I want to help you get her back.
But I want us to work together.
Please.
This is for your own good.
No! No.
No!
If any harm comes to my son because of what you did,
you will answer to me.
You OK?
It's OK.
What happened?
He took my powers.
He's here.
You have to go. I need to talk to him alone.
Elena.
Stefan I'm OK, he can't come in the house.
You know, I might not be able to enter this house.
But I'm a very patient man.
I'll wait you out.
They shouldn't have done what they did.
The deal is off.
I'm renegotiating.
You have nothing left to negotiate with.
I'd like to see you lure Klaus into Mystic Falls,
after the doppelganger bleeds to death.
Stefan won't let you die.
No, he won't.
He'll feed me his blood to heal me,
And then I'll kill myself and become a vampire,
Just like Katherine did.
So unless you want that to happen again,
promise me the same as before--promise me...
You won't harm anyone that I love.
Even if they've harmed you.
I'm sorry, Elena.
I'm going to have to call your bluff.
No!
Yes. Yes, you can have your deal.
Let me heal you.
Give me your word!
I give you my word.
Little tip. Don't pull the dagger out.
Where did John disappear to?
Maybe the same place the rest of the dinner party ran off to.
Look, Jenna, I'm, uh...
I'm so sorry tonight was--
What happened to Isobel?
You know, John should have never brought that up.
That's not an answer.
He's just trying to stir up trouble.
That's not an answer, either.
I can't talk about this, Jenna.
I keep thinking that maybe it's me.
Maybe I'm reading into things.
I should trust you.
That's what a relationship is about, right?
But then I think that maybe John is right
and maybe you're not being honest with me.
So...Are you being honest?
Right, OK.
Well, that was an answer.
Well, that was awkward.
You know, I can clear all this stuff up about Isobel tomorrow,
if you want.
Or not.
You want it?
Take it.
It's yours.
And after what you did to Damon...
You're gonna need it more than me.
What do we have here?
A little moonstone bar of soap.
I'll hold on to this.
So, that's it.
I mean, as long as we keep the dagger in there,
then he stays dead.
Pretty much.
Ok, then... Good night.
You know, you guys want me to fight, fine, I'll fight.
But if we're gonna do this,
you can't keep anything from me anymore.
From this moment on, we're doing it my way.
That seems fair.
Ok.
Ok.
Seems like she's had a change of attitude.
How did you get through to her?
I told her a little story
About when I was making the wrong decisions
and somebody showed me there was a better way.
Lexi?
Yeah.
You remember her?
Going somewhere?
You must be the vampire I hear my brother complaining about.
That would be me.
And you must be the brother who hates him.
We are at irreparable odds.
You know the hate you're feeling towards Stefan?
Towards everyone?
You think you have it under control but you don't.
It will get the best of you.
Help him.
He needs it.
I'll help him.
Andie?
I thought you left.
Hello, Damon.
Hey, do you have a robe?
How did you get out?
I knew that if I begged you not to kill Elijah,
that's exactly what you'd do.
Little known fact--originals can compel vampires.
But as soon as they die, the compulsion wears off.
And you knew?
And I'm still here.
I didn't run.
I meant what I said to him, Damon.
I'm going to help you.
