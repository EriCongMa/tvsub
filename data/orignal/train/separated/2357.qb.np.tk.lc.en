vampires and werewolves used to roam freely
until a shaman put a curse on them to limit their power .
since then , werewolves can only turn on a full moon
and vampires are weakened by the sun .
you &apos;re saying that the oldest vampire in the history of time
is coming after me ?
you want to find klaus ? start with isobel .
elena &apos;s mother .
i &apos;m prepared to offer you a deal .
what kind of a deal ?
i need you to stay put
and stop trying to get yourself killed .
why are you helping me ?
i don &apos;t want you to be alone .
a bite from a werewolf can kill a vampire ,
so don &apos;t be his friend .
do you understand me ?
what are you doing here ?
i miss you .
hey . i &apos;m jules .
i &apos;m trying to track down mason .
you should leave town .
are you threatening me ?
on a full moon .
it &apos;s healing .
morning .
everything all right here ?
it was an animal .
a wolf . it came at us in the night .
are you ok ?
yes .
but my friends !
they &apos;re all dead .
i &apos;m calling it in .
come in , dispatch .
go ahead , jerry .
stefan ?
stefan ?
you &apos;re standing right behind me , aren &apos;t you ?
yep .
good morning .
i don &apos;t want us to be apart anymore .
ever .
me , neither . but ...
don &apos;t ruin the moment .
you &apos;re about to ruin the moment , aren &apos;t you ?
i &apos;m totally ruining the moment .
i can &apos;t just pretend like everything &apos;s ok .
katherine &apos;s locked away in the tomb .
i know , but we still have this pressing little issue
of you being klaus &apos; human sacrifice .
yes , but elijah promised to keep me
and everyone else safe as long as we played by his rules .
right . as long as you played by his rules .
please don &apos;t go after isobel .
katherine said isobel could have some answers ,
and i just have a couple questions , that &apos;s all .
stefan , i made a deal with elijah .
right . you made a deal with him .
i didn &apos;t make one .
you should keep your deal .
stefan , i don &apos;t want anyone else to get hurt .
when have i ever wanted somebody to get hurt ?
vervain . i made it light ,
but are you sure ?
just because katherine built up a tolerance ...
yes .
bottom &apos;s up .
you ok ?
how can elijah compel another vampire ?
he &apos;s an original . i don &apos;t really know what that means .
i don &apos;t think anybody really knows what that means .
except maybe isobel .
and we should ask her .
i was born in 1450 .
that makes me 560 years old .
if you were a bottle of wine ...
so i can die .
i &apos;ve lived long enough .
you know , if you &apos;re going to be maudlin ,
i &apos;m just going to kill you myself .
just to put me out of your misery .
come on , it &apos;s just a little werewolf bite .
just a little fatal to a vampire werewolf bite .
well , according to legend ,
which is a notoriously unreliable source ...
drink up .
blood heals .
it does feel like it &apos;s working .
let &apos;s have a look . come on .
let me see .
how is it ?
definitely ... better .
right , elena ?
it &apos;s not bad .
where &apos;s stefan ?
he left . i need you to talk to him .
he &apos;s convinced that he has to find isabel .
but i think that &apos;s going to upset elijah .
no can do . i &apos;m with stefan on this one .
but if you could play nurse
for a little while ...
it &apos;s not necessary .
it is necessary . elena &apos;s a do @-@ gooder .
it &apos;s in her nature . she just can &apos;t resist .
damon .
is she going to die ?
probably .
the wolf bite caused some kind of infection .
it &apos;s getting worse .
like poison ?
i don &apos;t know , elena .
i &apos;m not an expert in the field .
i &apos;m sorry .
death happens .
we come , we go . sooner she dies , the better .
it &apos;s gloomy as hell in here .
how you feeling ?
i &apos;m ok .
sore . every muscle aches .
you did it .
your first full moon , and you didn &apos;t hurt anyone .
and it &apos;ll get easier .
you &apos;ll get better at it , you &apos;ll learn to control it ,
and it won &apos;t hurt so much .
well , we don &apos;t know any of that for sure .
no , but small victories , tyler .
last night was a victory .
you know , let &apos;s take it .
look , i really want to thank you .
i don &apos;t know what i would have done
if you hadn &apos;t been there .
yeah , anyway , um ,
next month we should probably , uh ,
reinforce the wall ,
because it almost got me that one time ,
and it just would have been ...
what ?
never mind . it &apos;s--
wait , no , hey .
no , what-- what is it ?
well , it &apos;s not a big thing .
it &apos;s just that one bite ,
curtains for me .
what are you talking about ?
the legend says that
a bite from a werewolf
can kill a vampire .
how do you know that ?
i think i read it somewhere .
hey , caroline . do you have a second ?
uh , yeah , sure .
i &apos;ll see you guys later .
that was nothing , ok ? there is nothing
going on between tyler and i.
we were just talking--
i believe you .
hey , look , caroline ,
you &apos;re a lot of things but you &apos;re not a liar .
you &apos;ve always been straight with me . i believe you .
well ... good .
and that &apos;s why i want to be straight with you ,
because i-- i think we got some wires crossed here .
and you know how tongue @-@ tied i get ,
and , well , i don &apos;t like this .
whatever this is that &apos;s going on between us ,
i just want to--
hey . you can &apos;t--
what ? just ...
but caroline--
no , matt , ok ?
sheriff forbes .
hi . i &apos;m mason lockwood &apos;s friend from florida .
jules , right ?
is there any news ?
no one &apos;s heard from him .
i &apos;ve opened an investigation .
as soon i hear anything , i &apos;ll let you know .
hey , damon .
the , uh , wolf is at the grill .
thank you .
ah , is that the-- wow .
yeah , yeah .
i just left damon a message .
so you &apos;re doing his dirty work for him now .
well , she could have a cure for rose .
i couldn &apos;t find anything in isobel &apos;s research .
except that it &apos;s fatal .
do you still know of a way
to get in touch with isobel ?
even if i did , she isn &apos;t going to help .
katherine said that isobel knew of klaus .
so this isn &apos;t about rose .
it &apos;s about elena .
i have an old number .
probably out of service .
no harm in giving it to me , then ?
you know you can &apos;t trust isobel .
even when it comes to elena .
i know that .
all right .
i &apos;ll see if i can find the number .
if i do , i &apos;ll text it to you .
i hate this .
i &apos;m a vampire .
i haven &apos;t had a cold in 5 centuries .
just get in bed .
we don &apos;t get sick . when we die ,
it &apos;s fast and sudden .
and it &apos;s certainly not drawn out with an illness .
you &apos;re not going to die .
such a human thing to say .
you &apos;ve never been in damon &apos;s room before , have you ?
玛格丽特 · 米切尔
it &apos;s not what you expected ?
it &apos;s just a room with a bed .
maybe i expected there to be silk sheets .
you &apos;re lucky , you know .
no one &apos;s ever loved me the way you &apos;re loved .
i doubt that .
trevor was my best friend . nothing more .
i spent all those years on the run from elijah .
i just never thought it was a good idea to set up roots .
the whole idea of a family is not exactly compatible with being a vampire .
why are you so eager to give up ?
i &apos;m not giving up on anything . here .
what do you call this whole deal with elijah ?
i call it my best option .
it &apos;s your easiest option .
that &apos;s not fair .
you really think that your witch friend
destroyed the moonstone ?
i spoke with bonnie .
i know that she had the help of another witch .
assuming it &apos;s elijah &apos;s witch ,
so , no , i don &apos;t .
you really are determined to die , aren &apos;t you ?
at least i ran .
you &apos;re not even trying .
i &apos;m so tired .
no , stop , wait .
tell him to prepare the horses .
it &apos;s ok , rose . just get some sleep .
you &apos;ll feel better when you wake up .
trevor , don &apos;t be so stupid .
we &apos;re never going to make it there before the sun .
oh , elena .
elena , i need more blood .
yeah , of course , here .
here .
ok , you &apos;re all right .
it &apos;s all your fault , katerina !
you , katerina . you did this !
elena ! rose , rose , i &apos;m elena !
you traitor !
i &apos;m not katherine !
elena ?
oh , my god .
it &apos;s me , it &apos;s elena .
oh , my god , elena , i &apos;m so sorry .
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s happening to me . i &apos;m sorry .
you &apos;re going to be all right .
my mind , i &apos;m ...
it was just for a second .
i &apos;m sorry . don &apos;t be scared of me .
i &apos;m not .
i &apos;m not .
but ... you need to rest .
i &apos;m scared .
you &apos;re not alone . i &apos;m right here .
here , where &apos;s here ?
damon &apos;s bedroom . you &apos;re in damon &apos;s bedroom .
i want to go home .
tell me about it .
st. austell .
30 kilometers south of london .
with fields and trees and horses .
sounds beautiful .
when you live long enough , everything disappears .
so much time wasted . i just wish i hadn &apos;t been so afraid .
isobel , it &apos;s stefan salvatore .
i , um , i need to speak with you .
it &apos;s about elena .
please know that it &apos;s important .
what are you doing here ?
i &apos;ve been waiting for you .
listen , there &apos;s a lot of people here .
well , damn . there goes
my plan to rip her spleen through her back .
hey , listen . i know you &apos;re upset about rose .
why does everybody think i &apos;m upset about rose ?
i &apos;m fine . i don &apos;t know if you know this ,
but sometimes vampires die .
i &apos;m going to have a friendly chat
with ladywolf , brother . ease up .
hello ?
well .
it isn &apos;t the one i meant to kill .
i &apos;ll have to get that right next time .
you won &apos;t live to see another full moon .
unless ...
unless you tell me how to cure a wolf bite .
and then i won &apos;t kill you .
promise ?
yes .
bite me .
i &apos;m not afraid of you .
then you are very , very stupid .
how &apos;s your friend ? rose .
is that her name ? have the chills started ?
the unbearable pain .
if there &apos;s a cure , tell me .
or start watching your back .
did i mention the dementia ?
it &apos;ll eat away at her brain .
soon she &apos;ll be rabid .
you want a cure ?
i &apos;ll tell you the only cure that exists .
take a stake and drive it through her heart .
i brought some clean sheets ...
it &apos;s elena .
i &apos;m worried about rose .
i think you should come home .
rose ?
oh , my god .
katerina .
no !
rose , stop , stop , it &apos;s elena .
i &apos;m not katherine .
you &apos;re hallucinating .
i &apos;m not katherine .
i &apos;m not katherine .
elena ? i know that it &apos;s you and not katherine .
elena , please . i need your help .
caroline .
why ?
why what ?
i kissed you .
i know . i--i was there .
so why &apos;d you run away ?
you caught me off guard .
yeah ?
what did you expect me to do ?
not that .
well , i &apos;m sorry .
and ...
and what ?
what do you want me to say , matt ?
something . anything .
how did you feel ?
anything in the realm of truth right now would be nice .
okay .
i feel ...
like i--
i love you .
i love you .
then what &apos;s the problem ?
what are you keeping from me , carrie ?
look , if you love me , you &apos;ll tell me .
so what is it ?
hey , matt ! we need more burgers .
yeah , not now , dana .
are you okay ?
where &apos;s rose ?
i don &apos;t know .
excuse me .
are you ok ?
hi .
thanks for coming so quickly .
no , i was close by .
liz , what happened ?
a vampire . luckily one of my deputies discovered the body
before anyone else saw him .
you have to secure the area , then .
don &apos;t cause a panic ,
but let &apos;s move this party into the cafeteria .
i &apos;ll the east side of the school , you go west ?
sure .
hey , stefan , it &apos;s me .
i don &apos;t know where you are , but please call me .
it &apos;s important .
hey .
have you heard from him ? do you know what he &apos;s up to ?
baby brother &apos;s not exactly my priority right now .
take this .
come on , let &apos;s go .
hey , what was going on back there with the police ?
some maintenance man had a heart attack .
he just dropped dead .
eddie ?
rose , stop !
rose , rose ! it &apos;s me , damon .
it &apos;s me .
it &apos;s damon .
did i do this ?
no ! i didn &apos;t mean to .
i didn &apos;t mean to hurt anyone .
i never wanted to hurt anybody .
i know , i know .
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m so sorry .
come on , let &apos;s get you home .
no , i don &apos;t have a home .
i haven &apos;t had a home in so long !
oh , make it stop ! please , make it stop !
oh , make it stop !
hi there .
i &apos;m sorry .
you went on a murderous rampage .
it happens .
i &apos;m sorry , elena .
i don &apos;t like taking human life . i never have .
you shouldn &apos;t be here .
that &apos;s the worst part about death--the hunt .
the need to kill .
the thirst .
pleasure it brings you afterwards .
i wasn &apos;t mean to be evil .
it hurts .
well , then stop talking about it .
damon &apos;s a lot like me .
he wants to care , but the minute he does ,
he runs away from it .
i &apos;m sorry for what i &apos;ve done today .
i know .
and you need to fight .
i know that you &apos;re scared ,
but you have to do it anyway .
why are you so nice to me ?
us humans .
you can never forget it .
what it &apos;s like to be human .
it haunts me .
it &apos;s the only thing that &apos;s kept me going .
it doesn &apos;t hurt as much anymore .
what do we do ?
go .
okay .
damon
just go . i &apos;ve got this .
oh , my god ! make it stop ! make it stop !
i can &apos;t take this anymore , make it stop !
hey .
where have you been ?
uh , school . what &apos;s up ?
what do you want ?
we need to talk .
why ?
what &apos;s wrong with you ?
i just don &apos;t understand one thing .
what ?
why would you risk it ?
if a werewolf bite kills a vampire ...
why would you risk it ?
because you needed help .
i could have killed you .
but you didn &apos;t .
y--
i don &apos;t understand you , caroline .
why is it so hard for you to let someone else help you ?
well , that &apos;s not it .
yeah , it is , tyler .
it &apos;s like you--you don &apos;t want anyone to care about you .
and , i &apos;m sorry , i care .
i care , tyler ,
so forgive me if i overstep my boundaries by actually giving a--
you can &apos;t do that .
i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s--
everyone just needs to stop kissing me !
who &apos;d have thought you &apos;d be a nice guy ?
i &apos;m not nice .
i &apos;m mean . i like it .
you lie .
shh , shh . just sleep .
just sleep .
this was my favorite place to come as a girl .
how did you know ?
word gets around .
you told elena .
am i dreaming ?
the sun is so warm .
i miss this .
i miss being human .
humanity &apos;s not all it &apos;s cracked up to be .
i had friends . i had a family .
i mattered .
you still do .
no .
but you do .
you built a life , whether you want to admit it or not .
i spent 500 years just existing .
you didn &apos;t have a choice .
you were running from klaus .
there &apos;s always a choice .
you know , you are ruining our perfect day
with your strange philosophical babbling .
i &apos;d like to enjoy the fresh air .
will you enjoy it with me ?
for a while .
thank you .
for what ?
the pain &apos;s gone .
i &apos;m glad .
will i see them again ?
my family ?
i think you will see whoever you want to see .
that would be nice .
maybe i &apos;ll see trevor , too .
i &apos;m not afraid anymore .
i &apos;ll race you to the trees .
well , you &apos;ll lose .
i &apos;m older and faster .
oh , you think ?
well , i &apos;m compelling this dream , maybe i &apos;ll cheat .
on the count of three .
one ...
two ...
here &apos;s your vampire .
how did you find her ?
doesn &apos;t matter . what matters
is that it &apos;s over .
thank you , damon .
once again , you &apos;ve helped keep this town safe .
i &apos;ll take care of burying the body .
thank you for coming .
so what do you want from me ?
just to be your friend .
mason would have wanted that .
i know about mason .
and you .
you know what ?
i know you &apos;re a werewolf .
and i know your little friend caroline is a vampire .
how do you know about caroline ?
you can &apos;t sniff them out ?
oh , my god .
you &apos;re brand new .
how many times have you turned ?
hey . i can help you .
do you know where mason is ?
he &apos;s dead , tyler .
he was murdered .
no .
you want to know who murdered him ?
it--just stop .
your little blonde vampire did .
no .
caroline would never do that .
she and her little vampire friends were behind it , tyler .
caroline is the only vampire in town .
is that what she told you ? she lied .
this town is crawling with vampires .
but don &apos;t worry . we &apos;ll get them .
who are you ?
i &apos;m your friend .
there are others like us , and they &apos;re on their way .
you were supposed to leave .
i did .
but then i came back to make sure that you &apos;re ok .
i appreciate the gesture .
i &apos;m just glad it &apos;s over .
you know i don &apos;t believe that .
go home , elena .
get some rest .
it &apos;s a whole new day tomorrow .
damon , i &apos;m your friend .
i &apos;m well aware of that .
and a friend usually knows when their friend is hurting .
what do you want to hear ?
that i cared about rose ? that i &apos;m upset ?
well , i didn &apos;t , and i &apos;m not .
there you go , pretending to turn it off , pretending not to feel .
damon , you &apos;re so close . don &apos;t give up .
i feel , elena , ok ?
and it sucks .
what sucks even more is that it was supposed to be me .
jules was coming after me .
you feel guilty .
that would be human of me , wouldn &apos;t it , elena ?
and i &apos;m not human .
you &apos;re one to talk about giving up .
it &apos;s all you &apos;ve done , is give up .
go home .
there &apos;s been enough doom and gloom and personal growth for one day .
ok . i will .
good night , damon .
stefan . you &apos;re home .
rose ?
i , uh , i called isobel .
i know .
i &apos;m sorry .
i had to .
it &apos;s ok .
did you find her ?
not exactly .
hello , elena .
uncle john .
sir , are you ok ?
what happened ?
i &apos;m ... lost .
and you &apos;re laying in the middle of the road ?
not that kind of lost .
metaphorically .
existentially .
do you need help ?
yes , i do .
can you help me ?
you &apos;re drunk .
no . uh , well , yes , a little maybe .
no , please don &apos;t leave . i really do need help .
don &apos;t move .
i don &apos;t want any trouble .
neither do i.
but it &apos;s all i got is trouble .
why can &apos;t i move ?
what &apos;s your name ?
jessica . hi , jessica .
i have a secret .
i have a big one .
but i never said it out loud .
i mean , what &apos;s the point ?
it &apos;s not going to change anything .
it &apos;s not going to make me good .
make me adopt a puppy .
i can &apos;t be what other people want me to be .
what she wants me to be .
this is who i am , jessica .
are you going to hurt me ?
i &apos;m not sure .
because you ...
you &apos;re my existential crisis .
do i kill you ?
do i not kill you ?
please don &apos;t .
but i have to , jessica .
because i &apos;m not human .
and i miss it . i miss it more than anything in the world .
that &apos;s my secret .
but there &apos;s only so much hurt a man can take .
please don &apos;t .
ok .
you &apos;re free to go .
