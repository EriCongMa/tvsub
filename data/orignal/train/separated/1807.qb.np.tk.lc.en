in order to get a good diagnosis ...
doctors have to constantly change their perspective .
we start by getting the patient &apos;s point of view ...
though they often don &apos;t have a clue what &apos;s going on .
so we look at the patient from every possible angle .
we rule things out .
we uncover new information ...
trying to get to what &apos;s actually wrong .
we &apos;re asked for second opinions ...
hoping we &apos;ll see something others might have missed .
for the patient ,
a fresh perspective can mean the difference
between living and dying .
for the doctor ...
it can mean you &apos;re picking a fight
with everyone who got there before you .
someone &apos;s getting fired .
stop it .
she wasn &apos;t even my patient .
what ?
nothing .
how long is this gonna take ?
why , you need to make a phone call ?
get off of him ! are you serious ? !
that &apos;s enough !
are you kidding me ? !
i said enough !
what happened here tonight , what happened to that patient ,
was inexcusable .
and we &apos;re gonna be here
till i find out who &apos;s responsible for it .
so until then , you will sit down ,
you will shut up and you &apos;ll wait to be called .

before they insert a bug up my ass ?
you guys are all so cranky .
well , dr. avery seemed uncomfortable
uh , consulting on a patient that wasn &apos;t his .
so i checked with the patient and asked her about her pain ,
and she said it was localized to her chest burns .
so i checked her chart for any allergies or drug interactions
and saw that she had silver sulfadiazine
and 1 gram of cefazolin and 800 of ibuprofen ,
so i ordered 2 of morphine .
you memorized her chart ?
yeah , i checked it
three times &apos; cause she wasnt my patient
so you ordered the morphine . did you follow up ?

i did. i @-@ i did. i @-@ i just ...
she did. she just missed a step .
one , two , three , four , f--
why did you do that ?
i had to , okay ? she was running out of time .
it was a tension pneumothorax. you have to release the press

you left him alone. when were you planning to--
i &apos;m s--i &apos;m sorry. i just-- i @-@ i feel like--
no , you don &apos;t get feel anything
because he &apos;s feeling everything .
his every nerve is exposed and raw , and we have to
make him feel worse before he &apos;s gonna feel better .
so if you &apos;re having feelings , you need to shut them down .
you need to shut them down and talk to him about his future
and remind him that he has one past all of this pain .
and if you can &apos;t do that , if you can &apos;t do your job ,
then you find someone who can and you send them to me .
did you see mrs . becker again ?
no .
did you see karev perform an emergency cricothyrotomy ?
i wasn &apos;t there .
i was right there. i saw it .

i don &apos;t know you .
but dr . adamson just spent 20 minutes in that chair
telling me what an excellent doctor you are .
your school records ,
your evaluation from mercy west all say the same thing .
and i believe it .
i believe you &apos;re good .
dr. webber , i @-@ i don &apos;t know--
so you should be able to tell me what would &apos;ve caused
cathy becker to bleed out and die
from multisystem organ failure .
she had d.i.c.
burns can cause massive tissue injury--
but the burn was properly cleaned and dressed .
well , there must have been more damage .
i mean , she had a collapsed lung .
that &apos;s right .
she needed a chest tube .
but why would her lungs have failed ?
she ... she went into respiratory distress .
they said they criked her .
i wasn &apos;t there for any of this .
and why would she need a crike ? why not intubate ?
well , her airway was too swollen .
they couldn &apos;t get
but what would
cause that kind of inflammation in her throat ?
soot. smoke inhalation. but she didn &apos;t have
how did mrs . becker &apos;s throat look ?
no , she was she was she wasn &apos;t hoarse .
she--she wasn &apos;t coughing .
how did it look , dr . kepner ?
her breath sounds were good. she her respiratory rate was
what--i &apos;m asking you ...
what it looked like .
okay .
your lungs sound good , and your vitals are great .
open up , please .
oh , my god .
okay. um , you look good .
these burns on your chest are pretty minor .
but the one on your calf might be third @-@ degree .
you never looked .
you didn &apos;t look in her throat ,
because if you had , you would &apos;ve seen soot .
and you would &apos;ve intubated immediately .
and none of this would &apos;ve ever happened .
no , that &apos;s it &apos;s i got distracted .
i know .
it was it was insane .
i know .
it was a simple mistake .
in the circumstances you were under , i know
i &apos;m sorry , dr . kepner .
no , i m i missed one step .
i know .
i ...
and look what it &apos;s led to .
she &apos;s bleeding out. she is bleeding out .
just stop. stop. everybody , stop !
it &apos;s over. you &apos;ve lost her .
well , whose patient is she ?
whose patient is this ?
time of death is 12 : 45 a.m.
you &apos;re fired .
oh , my god . danny .
oh , god .
oh. mwah. mm. you &apos;re okay .
oh. where &apos;s your mommy , pal ?
let &apos;s go find mommy , huh ?
when we &apos;re headed toward an outcome
that &apos;s too horrible to face ...
that &apos;s when we go looking for a second opinion .
it &apos;s not the doctors , richard .
they &apos;re all good doctors .
i know that .
what do you think this was for ?
for jennings , it was about legal .
but this was for me .
i needed to know who finally was responsible .
at least i was able to do that .
say it , derek .
maybe it &apos;s not one doctor .
maybe it &apos;s too many doctors ...
who don &apos;t know each other
and who don &apos;t trust each other .
when i got to that room ...
there was chaos .
because that &apos;s the system now ...
chaos .
that has been the system
that has been in place since this merger ...
your system .
i &apos;m saying you should look again at who &apos;s responsible .
and sometimes ...
the answer we get just confirms our worst fears .
but sometimes ...
it can shed new light on the problem ...
make you see it in a whole new way .
hey , is she gone ? did she leave ?
you know what ? she was good .
she was a better doctor than i am .
just ...
please shut up .
hey , you talk to april ?
no .
what
just waiting to see if you &apos;re gonna try to hit me again .
i &apos;m sorry . i was just , uh
forget it. rough night , right ?
so april missed an airway , huh ?
that &apos;s so stupid. airway first .
it &apos;s , like , med school 101 , right ?
it &apos;s pretty basic .
it was one second .
she got distracted and she made a mistake .
that we all nearly got fired for .
nosedive &apos;s got a point .
thank you. what ? we nearly got fired for trying to fix
what she screwed up in the first place .
yeah , because that &apos;s our job .
what , you didn &apos;t make any mistakes today ?
you &apos;ve been distracted for the entire week .
and who knows what you screwed up ?
but our patients didn &apos;t die ,
and that &apos;s why we didn &apos;t get caught .
it could &apos;ve happened to any one of us .
after all the opinions have been heard ...
and every point of view has been considered
here she comes .
you finally find ...
what you were after ...
april .
the truth .
but the truth isn &apos;t where it ends .
thank god .
i was beginning to think you went home
and left me here to rot .
go home .
that &apos;s it ?
ready to go ?
very . i &apos;ve been waiting for bailey all night .
that &apos;s just where you begin again ...
you okay ?
yeah .
let &apos;s go home .
what happened today ?
with a whole new set of questions .
