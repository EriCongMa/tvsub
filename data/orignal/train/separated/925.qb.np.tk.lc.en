back in the &apos; 80s ,
tom cruise danced , dove , and crashed his way into our hearts
in the classic teen movie &quot; risky business . &quot;
he was a pantless , partying badass in tube socks .
but for my brother , barry ,
&quot; risky business &quot; wasn &apos;t just a movie .
it was a plan for life .
dang it ! mom waxed the floor . i &apos;m going again .
shoes were a bad idea .
going again .
what did i tell you about tom cruising the floor , huh ?
it &apos;s incredibly risky .
risky . that &apos;s the point .
i mean it , barry .
take those sunglasses off and look me in the eye .
do you want to crack your head open ?
no tom cruising . say it .
no tom cruising .
say it like someone who doesn &apos;t want brain damage .
no tom cruising .
for years ,
all barry wanted was to live &quot; risky business . &quot;
and he finally got his shot
thanks to his rebellious , bad @-@ influence girlfriend ,
lainey lewis .
porsche . there is no substitute .
dude .
this is super hot and awesome ,
but your dad &apos;s gonna kill you .
actually , my dad just left
for a flooring convention in atlanta .
he gave me a buttload of pizza money and two rules --
no driving his porsche and no parties .
one down , one to go .
sweet rebecca de mornay , it &apos;s happening !
we &apos;re gonna throw a real , live kick @-@ ass &quot; risky business &quot; party !
erica , we need a keg stat .
lainey , jump in back .
big tasty &apos;s taking the wheel .
i can &apos;t move my legs .
i don &apos;t belong back here . why is it so hot ? !
turn the vents on me .
my god , please stop whining !
but this was supposed to be my &quot; risky business &quot; moment .
i &apos;m tom cruise .
no , you &apos;re the weird guy in the movie who sits in the back .
the dude who played booger ? that &apos;s bullcrap .
i &apos;m not booger . you be booger .
cramp ! leg cramp !
my hamstrings are too muscular . what are you doing ?
i got to stretch out .
just sit there like a good booger !
get your foot off the gear shift !
i &apos;m trying !
nobody move !
i &apos;m just gonna move a little .
barry ! don &apos;t move .
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m like a ninja .
i &apos;m just gonna --
i think it &apos;s fair to say this was everyone &apos;s fault .
shut up , booger .
it was september 23 , 1980 @-@ something ,
and i was in my first official long @-@ distance relationship
with my first official girlfriend , dana caldwell .
no , you hang up .
no , you hang up .
no , you hang up .
you hang up . ? you hang up .
you hang up . ? you hang up .
someone please hang up .
i can &apos;t hear what ? jake is saying to the fat man .
back before e @-@ mail and skype ,
the only way to stay connected was to talk on the telephone
or , for extra romance , sing .
* step by step *
unfortunately , my voice was in a transitional period .
* left , right , left *
* we all fall down *
* like toy soldiers *
oh , my god , that terrible sound is you ?
leave the singing to the professionals -- me !
even though my voice changed ,
we were still as strong as ever .
i was thinking that friday night
we could look at halley &apos;s comet together .
only comes around once every lifetime .
aww . you &apos;re amazing .
so , i &apos;ll watch it from here and you &apos;ll watch it in seattle .
whoa . you &apos;re talking to seattle ?
i thought danielle lived down the street .
it &apos;s dana , and i told you a million times she moved .
you can &apos;t call seattle before 8 : 00 .
do you have any idea how much your girlfriend &apos;s gonna cost me ?
hey ! ? you made me hang up first .
i &apos;m sorry , adam .
i can &apos;t afford your love . it &apos;s too pricy .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
it means i &apos;m canceling our long @-@ distance service .
there , it &apos;s done .
relationship over .
pops , talk some sense into this heartless man .
you &apos;re a smart kid .
find a creative way to connect with her .
you know , i once dated a filipino woman via telegram .
really ?
of course , western union had to shut us down
because mala could get very filthy in just three sentences .
point is -- love .
okay , you &apos;re useless to me .
as angry as i was ,
it couldn &apos;t hold a candle to the rage my mom felt
when she found out out the porsche .
do not be fooled by my sweater .
i am not flappy .
i &apos;m very flangry .
the good news is ,
lainey , i spoke to your father .
i told him all about his car
and all about the kick @-@ ass &quot; risky business &quot; party .
what ? ! ? how do you know about that ?
&quot; list of stuff to get
for our kick @-@ ass &apos; risky business &apos; party
because lainey &apos;s dad is in atlanta . &quot;
idiot ! why &apos;d you write it down ?
i &apos;m a visual thinker .
hush up !
the good news is , lainey ,
your dad agreed to let you stay with us until he gets back .
that means i have six days to fix your entire life .
no way .
you have already ruined our lives with your insane love .
you &apos;re not ruining lainey &apos;s , too .
please , she &apos;s hot rodding , failing her classes ,
spending time with shady friends .
showing questionable taste in boys .
that &apos;s fair .
maybe this is all a blessing in disguise .
i really could use some of your amazing mom wisdom , mrs. g.
i mean , i &apos;ve always admired you
and your store @-@ bought sweaters .
oh , no , i made this myself .
what ?
you should be a business owner and a millionaire by now .
see , this makes me very flappy .
you two learn from her .
we &apos;re gonna have so much fun .
i &apos;ll show you how to make my famous shrimp parm .
have you heard of it ?
of course you have . it &apos;s famous .
duh , beverly .
yum .
what is wrong with you ?
you never ask for her mom wisdom ever .
chill .
i &apos;m just telling her what she wants to hear .
so , the party &apos;s back on ?
i &apos;m gonna go write a list of things we need to get .
stop writing lists !
learn from your mistakes !
while erica and barry were trying to outsmart my mom ,
i was outsmarting the phone company .
hello ?
you have a collect call from ...
dana , i love you , my dad is a putz ,
how was your day , i want to kiss your --
adam ?
... face .
face !
how will she know ?
but as fate would have it ,
a new advancement in phone technology
would let me talk to dana ,
and it was glorious .
there it is .
behold the gem of the forbidden teacher &apos;s lounge --
the fax machine .
i know it &apos;s dangerous , but dana &apos;s worth the risk .
she &apos;s my soul mate .
suit yourself , man .
dave kim likes &apos; em thick .
it was the perfect plan .
dana would have my passionate love letter
in her hands in mere seconds .
or hours .
what the ...
turns out the fax totally sucked back then .
why are you so slow ?
oh , that &apos;s the wrong way .
it took me 10 minutes to send two frickin &apos; pages ,
but i managed to escape without a trace .
oh , hell no .
this is the teacher &apos;s lounge .
this place is sacred .
so help me god , you are in so much trouble .
someone took the tab for my flier for guitar lessons .
you are so lucky this day has turned around for me .
oh , no , wait a minute . i forgot .
i did it myself to get the ball rolling .
damn it !
you are in so much trouble again .
hey , is it cool if anthony balsamo &apos;s brother
invites his frat to the party ?
dude , what part of &quot; risky business &quot; party
don &apos;t you understand ?
my god , it &apos;s gonna be awesome !
hello !
erica and barry ! it &apos;s your mom !
and , lainey , it &apos;s your mom for the week !
oh , no . she &apos;s here . it &apos;s happening .
what &apos;s she doing here ?
why is there no color in your faces ?
i &apos;m waving my arms .
the start of every year , my mom storms the school
and demands that we get the best teachers and classes .
they call it ...
the demanding of excellence .
oh , come on . no one calls it that .
oh , sweet lord .
it &apos;s the demanding of excellence .
show no fear .
mom , stop right there , okay ?
i told you i don &apos;t need or want your help .
please take up tennis .
have a leisurely lunch with a friend .
just let us be .
oh , snuggle monkeys , i &apos;m not here for you .
i &apos;m here for lainey .
me ?
no , no .
no , see , you can &apos;t just walk in here
demanding excellence for other students .
that &apos;s not how school works .
you can only parent your own child .
oh , i &apos;ll parent every damn child in this school if i have to .
hell , i &apos;ll even parent you .
don &apos;t parent me .
looks like you got some color at the beach .
did you wear sunscreen ?
don &apos;t do that .
did you reapply after you went in the water ?
huh ? tell me .
i can &apos;t remember .
i was having fun .
what about this apple ?
did you wash it ?
yeah .
don &apos;t you lie to me . it still has a sticker on it .
okay , damn it ! ? just tell me what you want !
just tell me !
she &apos;s cheerleading five days a week
and yet you still have her taking gym class .
okay , fine .
want to have study hall instead ?
wait , for real ?
oh , yeah , sure .
keep being my mom . do it . go .
i also noticed lainey isn &apos;t cheer captain
when she &apos;s clearly the most talented dancer on the squad .
i demand you make her captain ,
and i want her on top of the pyramid .
here &apos;s a list of more demands .
meet them .
and wash that apple .
my work is done here . see you at dinner .
what happened ? ! what did she do ? !
i &apos;m so angry even though i don &apos;t have any of the information .
chill . it was actually awesome .
she &apos;s gone . you can drop the act now .
it &apos;s not an act .
no ! our mom is just poisoning your mind
with her endless well of love and support .
yeah , i &apos;m not seeing how that &apos;s a bad thing .
no , where are you going ?
cheer practice , where i &apos;m the captain .
you can &apos;t leave . we have a party to plan .
yeah , no party . not feeling it .
maybe some other time .
what the hell just happened ?
did we just lose our kick @-@ ass &quot; risky business &quot; party ?
it &apos;s worse .
we just lost lainey .
thanks for coming in , mr. goldberg .
wanted to address this teacher &apos;s lounge breach head on .
couldn &apos;t this have been a phone call ?
believe me , i don &apos;t want to be here either .
after school , i go to the mall with my parrot
and people treat me with respect .
her name is feather locklear .
real head turner .
look , i &apos;m sorry i used the fax ,
but i just want to reach my girlfriend .
again with the girlfriend ! unbelievable !
you &apos;re a guidance guy . guide him .
tell him long @-@ distance relationships don &apos;t work .
i &apos;m sorry , i beg to differ .
i &apos;ve been in a long @-@ distance relationship
for the past seven years .
really ?
yeah . ellen lives in tampa .
and i &apos;m lucky , too ,
because ellen has a male roommate
to keep an eye on her when we &apos;re apart .
she lives with a guy ?
yeah , todd .
he &apos;s a lifeguard , so he can totally give her cpr
if she ever gets in any kind of trouble .
he &apos;s a real stud .
i mean , does he even own a shirt ?
see , dad ? it can work .
okay , pay attention . this might be helpful to you .
uh , this long @-@ distance girlfriend you got ,
you see her much ?
well , not since she went to paris .
and of course , todd tagged along because he speaks french .
he &apos;s a good egg .
it sounds like she &apos;s with this todd guy .
no , no , no .
she &apos;s taken his last name for insurance purposes .
point is , long @-@ distance can work .
i want to believe you , but your story has some holes .
hey , don &apos;t flip this back on me .
you and dana are the ones on the rocks .
frankly , we used to gab about you guys in the teacher &apos;s lounge
how we didn &apos;t think your relationship had legs .
you &apos;re both wrong .
i may not be able to call or fax dana ,
but she will know how i feel ,
even if it means doing the unthinkable .
bro , you &apos;ve come to the right person for love advice .
let &apos;s do this .
without the phone or the fax ,
my only option was a musical love letter ,
written by my brother and starring me .
hey , sweet baby girl .
i know we can &apos;t talk on the phone ,
so i &apos;m gonna just let the music speak for me .
and i &apos;ll be speaking , too ,
&apos;cause this jam is written by big tasty .
ain &apos;t that right , lil &apos; yum yum ?
that &apos;s not my name , girl .
while i was starting to feel this was a bad idea ,
lainey couldn &apos;t have felt more at home .
so , then you &apos;re gonna say to yourself ,
&quot; hey , that &apos;s too much cheese . &quot;
but you know what ?
it &apos;s never too much cheese .
god , this is so much better than cold pizza every night .
and i love that little note you put in my lunch today .
well , i meant every word of it , my little snuggle monster .
yep , lainey was happy to be a goldberg ,
but the goldbergs weren &apos;t so happy .
it &apos;s like there &apos;s two moms now .
this is bad . this is really bad .
all i wanted was a kick @-@ ass &quot; risky business &quot; party
and a free pass to princeton .
is that too much to ask ?
don &apos;t give up hope yet .
it &apos;s time to bring out the big guns .
tissue me .
and then he said , &quot; let &apos;s break up , &quot;
and i &apos;m like , &quot; but i love you , &quot;
and he &apos;s like , &quot; i love you , too , but i &apos;m not in love with you . &quot;
i &apos;m sorry , lainey .
i just really need my mom &apos;s full and undivided attention .
wow , it &apos;s so surprising and unsettling to hear
that you &apos;ve had a boyfriend all this time
and none of us knew about it .
say , what was his name ?
h @-@ his name ?
his -- his name was , uh ...
shrimpson .
shrimpson ?
it &apos;s dutch !
i &apos;m sorry , lainey . maybe you should go .
no . no , no , no .
you &apos;re just trying to remove me from her life
just like how you removed me from yours .
what ? !
how dare you .
good luck with mr. shrimpsteen .
it &apos;s shrimpson !
okay , what are you doing ?
saving you .
from what ?
your mom &apos;s cooking ?
her sweet little notes ? her support ?
yeah , sure , it seems nice now ,
but my mom loves us more than any mom loves her kids .
i don &apos;t think the problem here is your mom .
it &apos;s you . you don &apos;t appreciate her .
fine .
but don &apos;t say i didn &apos;t warn you .
lainey .
come to temporary mommy .
lainey . lainey !
hi . what are you doing here ?
in the middle of the day ?
oh , it &apos;s kind of my thing . you &apos;ll see .
i just wanted to drop this off .
s.a.t. prep ?
yeah , here &apos;s the thing . i &apos;m not going to college .
what &apos;s that , now ?
i want to be a dancer in new york .
or vegas , whichever one &apos;s closer .
that sounds fun .
but yeah , you &apos;re going to college .
i &apos;m really not .
oh , you are .
i spoke to your father about it , and he signed off .
this is raji .
he &apos;ll be tutoring you every day at study hall
and saturdays at 8 : 00 a.m. when you &apos;re nice and fresh .
i &apos;ll see you at dinner , love bug .
your mom &apos;s very pushy .
as lainey was starting to panic about her new smother ,
i was finishing my love jam .
* nothin &apos; in between us *
* no distance can defeat us *
* dat &apos;s love *
* miles , inches , yards , feet *
* fathoms in the oceans , kilometers on the street *
* he &apos;d punch a stegosaurus *
* jump the grand canyon *
* karate kick godzilla *
* just to be your companion *
* nothing in between u-- *
it &apos;s bad , isn &apos;t it ?
it &apos;s not great .
well , i &apos;ve tried everything .
you were right , dad .
long distance never works .
you win .
you know , i seem to recall
a certain long @-@ distance relationship
that worked just fine .
what are you talking about ?
those six months you spent in rotc
away from beverly .
you know , when you called her every single day .
that was different . i was an adult .
just &apos; cause he &apos;s a kid
doesn &apos;t mean his feelings aren &apos;t real .
trust me , mur . he loves that girl .
* there &apos;s nothin &apos; in between us *
* &apos; cept love *
* and dinosaurs *
while i had given up ,
erica and lainey were preparing to take on my mom .
what have i done ? i unleashed the beast .
oh , this is not good . you were right .
this isn &apos;t a time for &quot; i told you so . &quot;
it &apos;s a time for action , and i told you so !
i &apos;ll do whatever you say to make it stop .
there &apos;s only one way .
she thinks that she calls the shots ,
but you have to break her heart and show her that you do .
may i suggest throwing a kick @-@ ass &quot; risky business &quot; party ?
can you stop eavesdropping like a weirdo ?
i eavesdrop like a badass , and you know it .
the weirdo &apos;s right .
the party is back on . yes !
within three hours , lainey &apos;s house was jumping .
a little too much .
the tv was stolen , furniture was danced upon ,
the record player was pizza &apos;d .
also , this lady showed up .
hey , we wanted &quot; risky business , &quot; right ?
yeah , but not this much .
i think there are actual you @-@ know @-@ what @-@ stitutes here .
even the nice geeks at school got swept up in the madness
and decided to let loose .
no !
unfortunately ,
they let loose an mvp football trophy
lainey &apos;s dad had won in college .
this party needed a hero .
and tonight , it wasn &apos;t tom cruise .
and ...
it wasn &apos;t barry goldberg .
it was my mom .
turns out the only thing worse than an insane party
is an insanely mad smother .
it was 1 : 00 am . ,
and the party was still raging . so was my mom .
i have failed as a mother and as a temporary mother .
shame on you .
lying , sneaking out , betraying my trust .
i mean , come o-- oh .
my god . thank you for coming .
i &apos;m so sorry .
save us from ourselves .
everything &apos;s gonna be all right . mama will fix it .
just let me soak in this hug for one more moment .
and then the fixing began ,
as my mom made the coolest party painfully uncool .
i know i told you never to tom cruise the floor ,
but sometimes you just got to say , &quot; what the &quot;
turns out it actually comes in handy
to have a smother so embarrassing
that she can clear out a party .
but in that moment ,
my brother and sister realized that lainey was right .
it &apos;s not so bad having a mom
willing to risk everything for her kids ...
i &apos;m okay .
... and when the smoke clears , clean up their mess .
thank you for staying .
it was pretty cool of you .
look .
i know i got carried away with lainey .
it &apos;s just ...
i loved having someone who was willing to listen .
someone who &apos;s not always pushing me away .
and i know you love us more than anything .
and we appreciate it .
we really do .
so maybe you won &apos;t push me away as much ?
depends if you won &apos;t get carried away so much .
yeah , both aren &apos;t gonna happen .
for now .
that &apos;s the amazing thing about parents .
no matter how hard you push them away ,
they &apos;ll never let you go .
and sometimes , they give you just the push you need .
what you writing ?
it &apos;s called a break @-@ up letter .
put your pen down .
you don &apos;t have to break up with what &apos;s @-@ her @-@ face .
her name is -- - dana , yes .
i know . i know . i know .
how about if i let you call her again ?
wait . seriously ?
10 minutes a night . will that work ?
really ?
10 minutes .
not a second more . i mean it .
i got a stopwatch in the drawer .
you said long distance was impossible .
yeah , well , i remembered
that i actually knew a guy who pulled it off .
really ?
yeah .
no matter how far away the girl was , he loved her ,
and that &apos;s all that mattered .
i love dana .
i @-@ i really do .
well , then , make that call .
but 10 minutes only .
there , i see it . halley &apos;s comet .
my god , so cool .
did you see it ?
yeah , i did .
oh , my god , that was amazing .
you know what the best part was ?
what ?
i saw it with you .
it was a night i &apos;d remember forever .
sure , dana and i were 3,000 miles away ,
but we never felt closer .
and even though my dad said he couldn &apos;t afford our love ,
in the end , he knew
there &apos;s just some things in life you can &apos;t put a price on .
adam , get off the roof . you &apos;ll break your neck .
* step by step *
* heart to heart *
* left , right , left *
* we &apos;ll all fall down *
* like toy soldiers *
i &apos;ll be your boyfriend .
yeah , i &apos;ll be your boyfriend , okay ?
don &apos;t you see we &apos;re young ? it doesn &apos;t matter what we do .
did you just take a tab ?
oh , my god .
oh , my god , you have no idea
how long i &apos;ve waited for this moment .
yeah , i just wanted to --
learn how to shred the axe ? you will .
oh . you just wanted to --
it lost its minty flavor .
wait a minute .
ellen is with todd .
