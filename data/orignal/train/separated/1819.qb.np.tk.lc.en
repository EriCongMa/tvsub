we like to think that we are rational beings ...
humane ...
conscientious ...
civilized ...
thoughtful .
this is your third session ,
and you still haven &apos;t said anything yet .
now while i love the quiet time , i &apos;m ...
i read a study that , uh ,
says that just the act of going to therapy is beneficial ,
even if you don &apos;t say anything ,
even if you just sit .
so you thought you &apos;d come here and just sit ?
that &apos;s how you &apos;re gonna solve your problems ? i don &apos;t have problems .
what brings you here ?
but when things fall apart ...
even just a little ...
it becomes clear--
we &apos;re no better than animals .
damn it !
it &apos;s not that bad .
i mean , once we get rid of the roaches , the apartment--
the crapartment .
george , this is our home. we &apos;ll fix it up .
with what money ?
we &apos;ll figure it out .
look , i like it here , and i would like it here so much more
if you would like it here , too .
we have opposable thumbs ...
look , i &apos;m fine .
it &apos;s just ...
i just haven &apos;t been sleeping .
you know , it &apos;s a--the ... just been five weeks ,
and i can &apos;t sleep .
five weeks since what ?
look ...
i work in this hospital .
i try not to listen to gossip ,
but this is a very gossipy place .
so there are some things that i &apos;ve heard .
derek &apos;s not the reason i &apos;m ... here .
he &apos;s not the reason .
then what brings you here ?
you know , i gotta go . i &apos;m in this contest .
dr. grey , if you j--
we think ...
we walk erect ...
i &apos;m up !
we speak ...
we dream ...
but deep down ,
we &apos;re all still rooting around in the primordial ooze ,
biting , clawing ,
scratching out an existence in the cold , dark world
like the rest of the tree toads and sloths .
there &apos;s a contest going on. sir ?
your residents--they &apos;ve been living in the hospital
around @-@ the @-@ clock for the last 14 days ,
engaged in a surgical contest with a point system .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
they &apos;re committed . it &apos;s commitment . it &apos;s a lion fight .
okay , i have one baby to get to day care .
i have 50 residents on my watch ,
four surgeries on my schedule .
the lions can fight all they want . i &apos;m not a zookeeper .
keep your animals under control .
yes , sir .
move it !
she &apos;s wretched ... and mean .
she &apos;s not . you know , i heard one of the nurses saying
that they &apos;ve only been on five dates .
yeah , cause derek knows she &apos;s wretched ,
and she &apos;s mean .
yeah .
what did you do to your hair ?
you guys , i know you &apos;re trying to make me feel better ,
but i have to tell you ,
this pausing to talk about rose and derek ,
it just means ...
yeah ?
i &apos;m gonna win .
you bitch ! ow ! what ? !
keeping it clean was getting in the way of the contest ,
so i chopped it off last night .
it just makes me faster and sleeker , like a cheetah .
you chopped off all your hot hair for a stupid contest ?
not stupid . rock star contest . best contest ever .
you should try living in the hospital
for two straight weeks , george . it &apos;s amazing .
this contest is for residents only .
yes ! i know that .
doesn &apos;t mean he can &apos;t still live here .
i feel juiced and alive , and my brain is clicking and running .
i have never been more on my game .
i &apos;m kinda sad the contest ends tonight .
i &apos;m not . i want that prize .
what prize ?
bailey won &apos;t tell us . but i want it . i want it bad .
too bad you &apos;re never gonna get it .
so on my game !
yeah . i &apos;ll talk to you later .

erica , yes .
so you and hahn are friends ?
erica. yeah .
see , this is the downside of the contest .
i &apos;m stuck here all the time ,
and callie &apos;s living in my apartment
and hanging out with hahn .
i bet they &apos;re just trying to pick up guys .
i &apos;m so glad i &apos;m past that . i don &apos;t need guys .
i don &apos;t need sex &apos; cause this competition is my orgasm .

oh , stevens is the only one working today ?
uh , no . we &apos;re all working . we got paged .
for the ankle. it &apos;s gone . now you &apos;re trolling for traumas ?

they &apos;re taking him to surgery . they don &apos;t know much yet .
we &apos;ll keep you informed .
okay , okay .
impressive hand , phillip . i can see right through it .
the bear cub , she just latched on and wouldn &apos;t let go .
and then--and then when scott
came over to try to help , the mother , she ...
oh , god . i can &apos;t believe we got out of there alive . he has to be all right .
he &apos;s gonna be all right . he has to be , right ? right ?
he has to be all right .
you really don &apos;t remember how you fell ?
one minute i was walking down the street ,
and the next minute , there was paramedics standing over me .
have you been feeling dizzy lately ,
like the room is spinning ? maybe a little .
uh @-@ huh . any muscle aches ? fatigue ? fever ? headaches ?
well , now that you mention it , yes .
any recent travels ?
well , i go back and forth to the east coast for my job .
i @-@ i live near a lake .
i get mosquito bites all the time .
oh , god. do i have something bad ,
like malaria or west nile virus or something ?
oh , no , no . there &apos;s no need to panic , mr. sharon .
we &apos;re gonna take this one step at a time , okay ? okay .
mama bear wasn &apos;t messing around .
mama bears never mess around .
i have a ross procedure ,
but i want to keep a close eye on
his chest tube outputs and blood pressure .
what &apos;s the game plan ?
he &apos;s a setup for overwhelming sepsis ,
so we &apos;re gonna deal with the life @-@ threatening blood loss
and get out of here .
you won &apos;t be able to touch him until he &apos;s stable .
i &apos;m in o.r. four .
can you make sure i &apos;m getting hourly updates ?
oh , i &apos;d be more than happy
to apprise you of his condition , dr . hahn .
fine .
you don &apos;t get points
for sucking up to an attending , yang. oh , shut up .
i hate this contest .
there &apos;s a lot of stuff in here. there &apos;s a lot of stuff .
stupid , stupid contest
stupid , and irresponsible .
oh ! i want to play .
there &apos;s good stuff , free stuff .
i need a butterfly needle , a vacutainer ,
and , uh , maybe an l.p. kit .
i &apos;m 26 points behind , so i need it fast .
why , what do you got ? something good ? oh .
uh , sprained ankle .
you get 26 points for a sprained ankle ?
last time callie treated
what we thought was a sprained ankle ,
it turned out the patient was malnourish ,
had a perforated ulcer and died on the table .
that &apos;s the best case scenario. yeah .
well , not the death part , george .
the medical mystery part .
it &apos;s 80 points for solving a medical mystery .
it &apos;s the holy grail of the competition .
oh , yeah. sometimes an ankle &apos;s just an ankle , though .
syncope , a very strange rash ,
pale , insidious onset
in a guy who travels a lot .
this is not just an ankle .
oh , thanks .
oh , i could do a lot with these .
that &apos;s an underpad .
underpads soak up urine .
or ... it could be a place mat .
oh , fruit bowl .
there. done .
beat you , busted hand and all .
it &apos;s completely illegible. he &apos;s a slob .
still beat her. okay , mr. robinson ,
dr. o &apos;malley is going to come and take you to x @-@ ray ,
and i am gonna take your wife to the waiting room
until you get back .
she said &quot; wife . &quot; i &apos;m still not used to that .
we &apos;re newlyweds .
congratulations. she &apos;s my rebound girl .
um , he &apos;s a little hopped up on painkillers right now .
i think you &apos;re oversharing , honey .
she thought she was my rebound girl ,
but i rebounded her , all the way to the church .
only knew her ten days ,
but when you know , you know .
you know ?
i &apos;m leaving you .
i &apos;ll miss you while you &apos;re gone .
are you okay ?
it &apos;s just , you know ,
you marry a man like that ...
or a man like that marries you ,
and he &apos;cute and he &apos;s rich ...
he &apos;s a catch by anyone &apos;s standard .
so you sort of sit around
waiting for the other shoe to drop ,
because there &apos;s no way a man like that marries you .
or me .
i mean , he married me .
i &apos;m sorry . i must look like a crazy woman .
it &apos;s okay ,
but it looks like you &apos;re bleeding a little .
do you mind if i just take a look ?
no , no . i &apos;m--i &apos;m fine .
i just scratched myself on a branch
when we were running .
why are you looking at me like that ?
c.t. &apos; s clear .
but it &apos;s deep. that bear clawed you good .
god , i didn &apos;t even feel it .
adrenaline &apos;s a pretty powerful drug .
you &apos;re gonna have to repair the galea ,
but it should reattach without a problem .
okay , squeeze my fingers as hard as you can , please .
i just got happy .
i just got married , and i &apos;m really , really happy .
i don &apos;t have permanent brain damage , do i ?
no , it appears that you do not .
okay , good .
page me if any neuro deficits appear .
you got lucky .
your scalp wasn &apos;t completely taken off ,
so we can just sew it back on .
your hair should cover the scar .
you won &apos;t even need surgery .
wow. that &apos;s great. thank you .
dr. grey here will take care of you .
you can go back to being a happy newlywed. okay .
don &apos;t worry. he and rose won &apos;t last .
he &apos;s hypothermic , and his bowels are swollen .
we need to stabilize him in the i.c.u.
and try and get him back to the o.r.
when he &apos;s less acidotic .
that &apos;ll give us time to deal with
the puncture wounds and the lacerations .
sorry to say that one of you has
several hundred sutures ahead of you .
i &apos;ll do it.i &apos;ll do it .
i need the practice. her stitches are flawless .
i need the work .
yes , they &apos;re flawless because i practice .
karev , it &apos;s yours .
yes. come on .
you need to update hahn on the condition
of the patient hourly .
that ought to keep you busy .
that is a minute an hour .
i can suture for the other 59 .
fine , you both do it .
that &apos;s not fair .
this man was a chew toy for a grizzly bear .
there &apos;ll be enough to go around .
a lot of enthusiasm for an afternoon of stitching .
some people find it boring .
i value the fundamentals .
it &apos;s a point a suture. kiss ass .
it is a hairline fracture .
his e.s.r. and c.r.p.s were elevated .
i also appreciated some swelling in the knee .
what does that mean ?
there could be some sort of
inflammatory process going on .
inflammatory ? that sounds bad .
i don &apos;t want you to worry yet , mr . sharon. yet ?
is there someone i can call for you ?
maybe you shouldn &apos;t be alone here today . .
um , how were his labs ?
w.b.c. &apos; s normal , slightly anemic ,
potassium &apos;s mildly decreased .
okay , give him , a , uh , k @-@ rider ,
then see if you can tap the fluid in his knee
to check for white cells or crystals .
let me know if the tap &apos;s positive .
good luck , mr . sharon .
you think i need luck ?
oh , god . i want to go home . i want to go home .
mr. sharon-- i @-@ i want-- look , i want to go back .
i want to go back to when i was 30,
and i want to stop smoking when i was 30 .
or back to when i was 20
and not start smoking in the first place .
i want to give up coffee and junk food and beer ,
and i want to be healthy like my ex @-@ wife
always nagged me to be. she was a saint .
she was a saint , and i drove her away .
i want to go back and not drive her away
so i don &apos;t end up at 60,
sick and fat and
alone and scared in some hospital
with some beautiful young doctor
holding my hand ,
that she wouldn &apos;t be holding my hand
except she &apos;s trying to figure out
what horrible disease i &apos;m gonna die of .
i ... i want to go home .
whoa. where &apos;s the fire ?
can &apos;t talk now. gotta kick karev &apos;s ass suturing .
uh , since when are you friends with my mentor ?
&quot; a , &quot; she &apos;s not your mentor
because she treats you like crap ,
and &quot; b , &quot; if you weren &apos;t living in the hospital
like a mange dog
you &apos;ll notice that erica and i
have been friends for a while .
you put in a good word for me , right ?
we don &apos;t talk about you . i let you live with me .
he &apos;s getting on the elevator. who ?
alex .
whoa ! hold it ! hold it !
it needs surgery , but callie wants to do
24 hours of antibiotic coverage .
so i think we should just irrigate and splint .
okay . i &apos;ll take care of it .
or i could take care of it ,
and you could take care of the wife &apos;s scalp .
she needs lots of complex sutures .
you could get lots of complex practice .
isn &apos;t that like a point a suture ?
you don &apos;t want that ?
i think this is bigger than a broken hand .
he provoked a bear
and then drove himself to the hospital .
well , he--he was in shock .
and he married his rebound girl. what ?
he married his rebound girl ,
after knowing her for only ten days .
nobody does that. who do that ?
i &apos;m thinking brain tumor .
i got married on the spur of the moment ,
and i don &apos;t have a brain tumor. that you know of .
i &apos;ll do the scalp. you will ?
i &apos;m gonna watch you
try to turn a broken hand into a neuro problem
just to get some extra points ? nope .
it &apos;s not about the points .
i &apos;m gonna watch you try to
turn a broken hand into a neuro problem
just so you have a reason to talk to shepherd ?
nope .
i do not need a reason to talk to shepherd .
if i want to talk to shepherd , i &apos;ll talk ...
oh. oh. hey. oh. what is this ?
is this a hint ?
i should be getting you more gifts ?
a grateful patient gave them to me ,
but since you &apos;re asking ,
i do like a nice box of chocolates .
you &apos;re gonna die of a diabetic coma ,
and i don &apos;t want any part of it .
cheapskate. crackhead .
have you seen him ?
i have. have you seen his eyes ?
i ... yeah . i &apos;m trying to play it cool .
i am playing it so , so cool . i love him .
oh , my god. i ... don &apos;t know you .
i ... didn &apos;t say that .
what &apos;s with the flowers ?
uh , are you asking as a resident or a sister ?
sister .
i &apos;m stealing stuff .
okay .
are ... you okay ?
resident again now .
stop stealing crap from the hospital .
22 .
keep a lid on it .
i like to know where i am .
ph is up to 7.28 .
yeah , not great , but it &apos;s improving .
push another amp of bicarb for a boost .
karev &apos;s only at 17. you &apos;re not helping !
did you just yell at the chief ?
uh ... s @-@ sorry , sir .
oh , i should end this competition right now .
no ! no .
uh , uh , i @-@ i mean ,
uh , it &apos;s--it &apos;s fine .
i mean , actually , they &apos;re doing some nice work .
23. she &apos;s beating the pants off of you , karev .
don &apos;t you have an update to deliver ?
well , i think hahn can wait a couple of minutes . yang .
crap .
i thought you told me to keep the animals under control .
well , from time to time , i like to go to the zoo .
dr. hahn , mr. robinson is critical but stable .
we had to put him on low dose levofed for his b.p. ,
and he &apos;s put out 350 cc &apos;s from his chest tube .
all right . i &apos;ll look forward
to another scintillating report in an hour .
of course .
i &apos;m thinking we ought to have a little contest of our own .
you want to live in the hospital like rodents ?
different kind of contest .
you and rose , you &apos;re not exclusive , right ?
so i &apos;m thinking @-@ you &apos;re not serious .
one won , 10 points . 2 women , same time , 20 points .
you get out in the morning before anybody wakes up ,
5 point bonus. you are serious .
you need a little spice in your life , man .
i &apos;m just trying to help . i am truly a worse human being for knowing you .
it &apos;s okay , mr . sharon .
oh , it &apos;s not okay. it hurts .
i &apos;m alone .
i &apos;m all alone , and it hurts , and i &apos;m not okay . i &apos;m dying .
by some lucky stroke of fate , you fractured your ankle
and ended up at sea grace hospital
with me as a doctor .
and i am gonna find out what &apos;s wrong with you ,
and then i &apos;m gonna do my damnedest to fix it ,
and if i can &apos;t fix it ,
i &apos;m gonna assemble a team of doctors
that are better than me ,
and they &apos;re gonna do their damnedest , too .
and then you know what &apos;s gonna happen ?
what ?
you &apos;re gonna live a healthier life ,
and maybe even call your ex @-@ wife
because you &apos;re being given a second chance at life
and this time-- this time you can do it right .
you &apos;re gonna feel a little pressure .
chief , mr. robinson &apos;s brother .
can i talk to him ?
just for a minute .
hey , that you , phil ?
how you feeling ?
i feel like a ...
like a bear ate my guts out or something .
you touched a cub , man. what the hell ?
i wasn &apos;t thinking .
i ... i &apos;m so sorry .
so touching the cub , you knew better ?
of course he knew better .
he &apos;s having an early midlife crisis .
he &apos;s gonna kill us all .
i &apos;m not having a midlife crisis. dude , dude , dude ,
you married your midlife crisis .
just &apos; cause you got eaten by a bear ,
you don &apos;t get to talk smack about my wife .
so was this spontaneous wedding out of character for you ?
he needs a little rest , so let &apos;s have some quiet .
oh , where was i ?
59 .
you are toast .
ticktock .
yan , no running
why did we do a spinal tap inon an ankle fracture ?
he &apos;s getting a full workup .
how many points ? what ?
look me in the eyes and tell me you are not
putting this man through painful and unnecessary procedures
because you &apos;re trying to win a contest . i &apos;m doing this
because my patnt had dyspnea on exertion ,
headaches , fever , myalgia ,
a confluent rash intermittently over his entire body .
i &apos;m working him up for r.m.s.f. and doing lyme titers ,
but i &apos;m also worried about a rare autoimmune
or rheumatoid disease
because of his high c.r.p. and sed ra
i &apos;m doing a spinal tap , too , because he was altered
and is amnestic about his fall earlier .
i @-@ i do want to win this contest , but i also want to make sure
that a man does not leave this hospital
with meningitis or encephalitis
and discover when it &apos;s too late that all we did
was treat his ankle .
all right , then. carry on .
when you hear hoofbeats , think horses not zebras ,
right , dr . bailey ?
exactly , o &apos;malley. exactly .
something tells me you &apos;re not just worried
about the damage to my hand .
phillip , earlier today ,
you were squinting at your paperwork .
i keep telling him he needs glasses. and your handwriting
was very tiny and wasn &apos;t all that legible .
is that normal for you ? well , uh , never been a straight @-@ a student ,
if that &apos;s what you mean. is he d-- or are we done here ?
we could both use some rest .
humor me for one more second .
okay , look straight ahead .
tell me when you see my fingers .
i see them. tumor !
sorry .
this is nice of you , really .
dreaming up some brain tumor to make me feel better
about the fact that i made a bear mad .
ever cross your mind i may be just the type of guy
who &apos;s dumb enough to pet a bear ? 詹尼弗 , is he that type of guy ?
well , don &apos;t ask me . i &apos;ve only known him a few months .
phillip , you knew better. you touched the cub anyway .
that , along with your other symptoms-- what symptoms ?
my vision &apos;s going bad. so i get glasses , right ?
but it &apos;s not just your vision .
brain tumors have been known to impede judgment ,
prompt spontaneity , impulsivity .
he married a trashy waitress , right ?
i mean , that &apos;s what you mean , that he married a girl like me ,
the rebound girl .
i &apos;m just saying , i would like him to have an m.r.i. ,
just to be sure .
well , the answer &apos;s no .
do the m.r.i.
honey , i don &apos;t need--
phillip , do the damn m.r.i. , because you &apos;re wrong .
he loves me .
he loves me .
mr. robinson is doing better .
we were able to d.c. the levofed ,
and he &apos;s intermittently awake and lucid .
his chest tube has put out 100 cc &apos;s since i last saw you ,
and i &apos;ll be back in an hour with another update .
is somebody chasing you dr . yang ? excuse me ?
what are you racing around for ?
uh , uh , no reason. no reason ?
not because you &apos;re running towards the finish line
of this surgical contest ?
ohthat .
yes. are you winning ?
yes , once i finish my sutures on mr. robinson .
oh , that &apos;s too bad .
i was gonna let yowatch me put mrs. witkowsky &apos;s new valve in ,
but if a contest
is more important than a cardiac suery , so be it .
i &apos;d be happy to watch , dr . hahn .
crap. crap. crap. crap !
ankle guy ?
his c.s.f. is spotless , the a.b.g. is normal ,
the ultrasound is clear-- what am i missing ?
what am i missing ?
oh. what ?
right there. where ?
see ? no .
well , the fact that you &apos;re doing unnecessary medical procedures
to win a contest. no ! oh , my god .
the fact that you and meredith are both doing
unnecessary medical procedures to win a contest .
meredith has a medical mystery ?
no , she doesn &apos;t. something is wrong. you wanna know how i knothat ?
no. great doctors have that extra instinct , george .
they just know. great doctors , they know when to stop .
i have to have that instinct , george .
cause my instincts lately ? very bad. really bad .
they told me to go for cardio .
they told me to have sex with a married man. oh ?
they are not serving me well . i am in danger
of going extinct here if this keeps up ,
and i am gonna win this contest if for no other reason
than i have to win it !
you paged me ?
i thought you might like to see this .
is that bear attack guy ? that &apos;s bear attack guy ,
and that &apos;s his big ol &apos; brain tumor .
and i &apos;m not requiring an apology , george .
i &apos;m not requiring an apology because the fact that
i may have potentially saved a life today
is reward enough for me. you &apos;re calling me in to gloat .
no .
i need a favor .
what am i at ?
87 .
you &apos;re an underdog , aren &apos;t you , karev ?
sir ?
it &apos;s not that you don &apos;t have the skills .
you have the skills .
but you &apos;re scrappy. you &apos;re a fighter .
i like that .
i always root for the underdog .
i &apos;m a fighter , but , uh , i &apos;m no underdog .
like this guy here .
he--he didn &apos;t , uh , he didn &apos;t provoke that bear .
his brother did it .
now he &apos;s here , fighting for his life ,
paying for someone else &apos;s mistakes .
it doesn &apos;t make him an underdog .
it just , well , makes him have to work harder
to overcome the cards he got dealt .
oh , he &apos;s crashing. hit that code button .
we got a code blue ! code blue !
this is meredith &apos;s patient ?
yes .
she didn &apos;t want to come to me herself ?
hey , i &apos;m just ... her intern .
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
honey , i &apos;m so sorry .
we did absolutely everything we could .
the stress was just too much for his body .
there &apos;s more .
the neurosurgeon is going to come in and talk to you .
no. no . i need to know .
please .
i &apos;m sorry . i was right about the tumor .
you have something called a malignant glioma .
this kind of tumor
causes , uh , behavioral ...
it can cause inappropriate affect .
can you operate ?
no. it &apos;s too invasive .
it &apos;s been growing a long time .
i &apos;m so sorry .
good .
good , i deserve that .
i killed my brother ,
so i don &apos;t deserve to survive .
um ... doctor ?
i &apos;m a symptom , right ?
i mean , i &apos;m ... i &apos;m like the bear cub .
i &apos;m just a symptom of this tumor .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re saying here , right ?
just so i &apos;m clear .
i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t know that .
you &apos;re the only one who could know that for sure .
when you say &quot; negative , &quot; do you mean as in bad
or as in nonexistent ?
nothing bad came up .
well , what about all those alphabet tests
you were railing off ?
i mean , they were elevated or something .
yeah. um ... they were nonspecific .
they likely indicated that you basically have
a relatively minor flu .
i have the flu ?
this whole day ...
everything you put me through ...
you put me through all this for the flu ? !
i &apos;m sorry . i am .
it just--it seemed like there was something more .
it really seemed ...
i know it &apos;s hard to see the silver lining here ,
but think of the discoveries you made today
about yourself and your life and--and your ex @-@ wife .
my ex @-@ wife was a castrating bitch !
she was a castrating bitch ,
and i never missed her for one day since she left !
not until today !
and i missed her today because if we were still together ,
she would &apos;ve shot me dead a long time ago , and i wouldn &apos;t
have had to gone through the hell you put me through !
i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t mean to . i really-- you treated me like a rat !
like a rat in some perverted lab !
ah ! just give my prescription . i want to get outta here .
the flu is a virus .
it , um , doesn &apos;t respond to antibiotics .
i suggest plenty of fluids and rest .
fluids and rest ?
fluid and rest ?
i &apos;m sorry. fluids and freakin &apos; rest !
i &apos;m sorry ! i &apos;m sorry ! i &apos;m really , really sorry .
what are you doing here ?
you spent the last three hours watching a surgery .
that &apos;s 3 points .
i &apos;m trusting you guys screwed up enough that it won &apos;t matter .
i could still win . i could .
i did get a lot of points today. what &apos;s the matter with you ?
where &apos;s the trash talk , charles barkley ? she knows i &apos;m the best .
who won ? congratulations ...
who won ? ! dr. grey .
oh ! the guy from the bear attack had a brain tumor ,
and grey caught it . 80 points for solving a medical mystery .
that &apos;s what put her over the top . i could &apos;ve found a tumor .
but you didn &apos;t. you chose to scrub in with hahn
and watch for 3 little points. now congratulate dr. grey .
congratulations .
hey , don &apos;t you want your prize ?
ooh. a shiny pager .
a sparkle pager .
what &apos;s so great about a glitter pager ?
a sparkle pager .
it is special. it is surgery &apos;s holy grail .
it &apos;s been passed down from resident to resident ,
and now it belongs to dr. grey .
for the next three months , whenever you all get a surgery ,
you have to page this pager , and if grey wants your surgery ,
she has the right to take it from you. come on .
crap .
enjoy the power , dr. grey .
now may i recommend you all go home ?
you smell , you greasy , you need to bathe ,
and i &apos;m sick of looking at you .
even my 1 year old here is sick of looking at you .
isn &apos;t that right , bug ?
sick of looking at your little , ugly faces .
somehow i thought i would enjoy this more .
oh , well , give it to me . i &apos;ll enjoy it .
don &apos;t give it to her. give it to me .
oh , shut up. it &apos;s hers. she &apos;s the winner .
she &apos;s not gonna give it to you. give it to me .
are you kidding me ? are you kidding me ?
i don &apos;t like her .
i &apos;m sorry , but as your friend , it &apos;s my job to say it .
i don &apos;like rose .
why ? you &apos;re not even sleeping with her .
you don &apos;t like her because she &apos;s not sleeping with me ?
that &apos;s a little weird. it &apos;s not weird .
it &apos;s a little weird. hey , if you were sleeping with rose ,
i could understand why you &apos;re spending time with her ,
but you &apos;re not .
and it &apos;s--it &apos;s just , uh , i thought that , uh ,
you know ...
i thought it was just gonna be you and me .
having sex ? after .
after addison , after meredith .
i have been patient. mm .
i have waited while you partnered up with these chicks ,
but now they &apos;re over ,
and it &apos;s supposed to be just us ,
you and me , two guys on the prowl , on the hunt .
you &apos;re having trouble getting laid ,
and you need my help . i can get laid .
mm @-@ hmm . i can get laid whenever i want .
i do get laid whenever i want. uh @-@ huh .
that &apos;s the point. women are everywhere .
i only have one person i can talk to .
that &apos;s sweet. shut up .
no , it &apos;s really warm and fuzzy , very sweet. shut up .
aryou serious about this woman ?
i don &apos;t know .
could be .
all right . i &apos;ll give her a chance .
you &apos;re pathetic , and i &apos;m gooa lesser man for knowing you .
that &apos;s my line. you can &apos;t use my line .
thought you were off duty an hour ago .
i &apos;m just catching up on some paperwork .
yeah. piled up on you during the contest , i guess .
you know about that ?
i know about otis sharon
and the $ 120,000 worth of unnecessary tests you ordered .
yeah. well ...
i lost .
and i put a man through hell for no reason at all .
i was a bad doctor today with bad instincts ,
and i deserved to lose .
i don &apos;t know why i even bothered competing
in the stupid contest. so don &apos;t need to yell ?
you should. you can .
but you don &apos;t need to .
good .
stevens .
yes , sir ?
my year ...
i lost by 2 points .
you--
you didn &apos;t invent the contest .
the contest is a lion fight .
so chin up , put your shoulders back ,
walk proud , strut a little .
don &apos;t lick your woun. celebrate them .
the scars you bear are the sign of a competitor .
you were in a lion fight , stevens .
just because you didn &apos;t win
doesn &apos;t mean you don &apos;t know how to roar .
good night .
good night , sir .
there &apos;s a little animal in all of us ,
and maybe that &apos;s something to celebrate .
our animal instinct is what makes us seek comfort ,
warmth , a pack to run with .
hi , um ... h-- hello , dr . hahn .
i hope it &apos;s okay i invited somebody over .
oh , no , it &apos;s fine. it &apos;s , uh ...
.. it &apos;s an honor to have you here , dr. hahn .
okay . i have to tell you ...
you won &apos;t believe it. yes .
i ... okay .
was just going in there .
we may feel caged ...
are you kidding me ?
we may feel trapped ...
but still , as humans , we can find ways to feel free .
be @-@ before you say anything ,
before you say a word , just--st hear me out .
i know it &apos;s not much ,
and i @-@ i @-@ i know it &apos;s all stolen .
i @-@ it &apos;s all stolen and-- and--and hospitaly
and stolen .
you can turn me in if you want to .
you can report me for stealing , cause obviously ,
now i &apos;m a thief .
i &apos;ve never even shoplifted a piece of gum before ,
and now i &apos;m a thief , except i &apos;m--i &apos;m not .
i &apos;m a nester . i &apos;m- &apos; m nesting. this is me nesting ... for you
because you hate it here .
you want to be at that big house
with meredith and izzie where things are warm
and you have your friends
and--and there aren &apos;t any roaches .
but this can be warm , and i put out traps for the roaches .
and--and i ... i can be your friend .
no , i @-@ i ... i can be your friend .
i d @-@ don &apos;t-- i don &apos;t have any friends here ,
not--not really , except you .
and--and i don &apos;t have a home to go to anymore ,
ex @-@ except here .
i just--i ...
i can be your friend .
i complain a lot , don &apos;t i ?
i--it &apos;s ... okay .
no .
no. you know what ? i &apos;m gonna stop .
i &apos;m just--i &apos;m just gonna stop right now .
i &apos;m gonna focus on what &apos;s good , you know ,
like , uh , like this crapartment ,
like this apartment .
we are each other &apos;s keepers .
wish you &apos;d have stolen a tv .
i tried. they &apos;re bolted to the walls .
still .
we are the guardians of our own humany .
good morning. how are you ?
okay. okay .
i &apos;ll see you .
and even though there &apos;s a beast inside all of us ...
hi .
i think i found a way to save lives .
i don &apos;t know for sure , but i think , uh ,
we can save people who have the kind of tumors
that m robinson has .
mr. robinson--the man who was mauled by the--the bear .
i did all this research , and i found this .
it &apos;s rare , and it &apos;s still untested in humans ,
but i could find patients for a clinical trial ,
and i could do the lab work , and i could track the results .
but i do need a neurosurgeon , and you &apos;re one of the best .
it &apos;s not about us . i would go somewhere else if i could .
but ... i don &apos;t know .
i think i found a way to save lives .
what sets us apart from the animals
is that we can think , feel , dream and love .
and against all odds ...
against all instinct ...
okay . i think i better start talking now .
