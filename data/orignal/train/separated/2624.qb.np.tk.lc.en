ah , good evening , father . you &apos;re looking sharp .
mr. valmont , the tally .
moments away .
gentlemen .
what are the standing totals ?
master tyler king , $ 67,800,000 .
all bids paid in full .
master francis king , $ 67,400,000
with one account pending for $ 1.8 million .
you haven &apos;t won yet .
i have , and you know it .
the contractual deadline has passed .
the last tally stands .
mr. cardini failed to wire funds for his lot .
i &apos;m sorry .
well , boys , get on with it .
next time .
94Âè∑
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;ve got nothing right for you .
if something comes in --
i just need to go back in , okay ? i don &apos;t care what it is .
i &apos;ll take anything .
you don &apos;t want to do that .
sit down .
you got class .
you &apos;re the boyfriend . you &apos;re the hip , young executive .
that &apos;s where the top dollar is .
anything else , for you , is a sinful waste .
but i don &apos;t care .
i don &apos;t care about top dollar .
i just need to go back under .
bud , please . it &apos;s me . i can play anything .
don &apos;t tell me that girl got to you .
if you need a palate @-@ cleansing so bad ,
i may have something .
how &apos;s your german ?
i hope you &apos;re considering the apartment at the audrey .
you must stop living like this .
by all means , come right in . make yourself at home .
madeline pratt has been abducted .
what do you care ? she almost got us both killed .
foreplay .
my relationship with madeline is ... nuanced .
confounding , yet captivating ,
she &apos;s a singular woman ,
and the world is far more interesting with her in it .
what &apos;s more , her abductors meet every requisite
that defines inclusion on the blacklist .
the kings .
the kings ? of what ?
not &quot; king &quot; as in &quot; king and castle . &quot;
earl king and his two sons , tyler and francis ,
descendents of a senescent dynasty .
their forefathers built a fortune
on the backs of british undesirables ,
forcing them into decades of indentured servitude --
a tradition that has been passed from generation to generation
that still continues today .
so , what does this have to do with madeline pratt ?
madeline has made
a number of well @-@ heeled enemies over the years ,
many of whom would pay a handsome price for her head .
if merely saving a woman &apos;s life
isn &apos;t enough to warrant the bureau &apos;s interest ,
consider what taking down
a dynasty like the king family would mean .
every transaction
meticulously recorded for posterity
in the family ledger .
sometimes , years pass between auctions .
they &apos;re never held in the same place twice .
the guest lists are constantly changing .
this is your chance to solve
a century and a half &apos;s worth of abductions and thefts
from the davidoff @-@ morini stradivarius
to the disappearance of raoul wallenberg .
this phone belonged to a boy in the port of lisbon ,
where madeline was abducted .
pictures of the kidnapping .
find the jackals who took madeline
and they &apos;ll inevitably lead you to the kings .
so , we &apos;re going after one blacklister to save another .
tell me how that makes sense .
earl king and his two sons , tyler and francis --
from available intel , they appear to be
an eccentric family of trust @-@ fund billionaires .
according to reddington ,
they supplement their family fortune
with profits from their illegal auctions .
six months ago ,
22 pounds of yellowcake uranium seized by mi5
disappeared from their evidence vault in leeds .
the painting --
stolen from the van gogh museum in amsterdam .
reddington claims
both these items will fall under the gavel
at the kings &apos; next auction .
i think i might have something .
i isolated this image from the pics ,
fan it against our known @-@ tattoo database ,
and got a hit .
silvio haratz , a brazilian @-@ born kidnapper
working the world &apos;s k &amp; r hotspots .
if the auction &apos;s gonna be held on u.s. soil ,
haratz is headed here .
we &apos;re gonna need local intel .
the d.o.j. has an active file on haratz ,
but it &apos;s restricted access .
i can &apos;t open it without throwing up red flags
in the attorney general &apos;s office .
i may know someone who can help .
the rest of you , dig up anything you can on the kings .
what do you have on haratz ?
enough to haul him in , but not enough to make it stick .
that &apos;s all i can say . we &apos;re building a case .
i have a good friend ,
c.e.o. of a med @-@ tech company .
got himself mixed up in a fraud scheme .
the grand jury convened ,
and it &apos;s looking like there &apos;s going to be an indictment .
they &apos;ll seize his assets .
it would be nice if he had a chance
to shield a little something in a blind trust for his kids .
you want me to tip him off ?
he &apos;s a good friend , close friend .
and i take care of my friends .
how &apos;s that clinical trial ?
the one i got you into ?
you look well .
agent keen .
hello .
the suspect &apos;s name is silvio haratz .
he &apos;s using a safe house called the palace .
we &apos;re on our way .
no . i know the palace .
you people get within a mile of that place , he &apos;ll be made .
i &apos;ll handle it .
forget it , reddington .
we &apos;re not on your payroll , and you can &apos;t call us off .
we &apos;re on it .
how much do you want for her ?
you can have her .
sorry , dembe .
well @-@ played , madeline .
payback for my little gambit last year , i presume .
consider us even .
raymond &quot; red &quot; reddington .
lot number 11 .
beautiful .
careful there , boys .
you don &apos;t want to bruise the merchandise .
we intercepted dembe .
he informed us they used pratt as bait ,
faked the kidnapping
in order to bring red into the kings &apos; custody .
king family auctions
are all about providing criminals with items of value .
what &apos;s more valuable than reddington ?
where are we on potential auction locations ?
the kings have real @-@ estate holdings all over the world .
you &apos;d have to be invited to know where this thing is .
let &apos;s not focus on the kings .
let &apos;s focus on the kings &apos; guests .
try and match the items we know they have for sale
with the people who might be interested in buying them .
we &apos;ll put together a list .
alert immigration and the tsa on major points of entry .
identify and report only . do not detain .
your insistence on not speaking , sir ,
is making a tedious exercise ever so much worse .
over here , gentlemen .
please .
someone help me .
raymond reddington in the flesh .
you must be tyler .
i hope you &apos;re not as short @-@ sighted as your brother .
i could be one of your most valued customers .
as i recall , you &apos;re one of the few prospects
who rejected an invitation to our auction .
nice try , though .
i haven &apos;t even begun to try .
there is one thing about your family
that &apos;s always intrigued me .
statistically , 65 % of inherited fortunes
are frittered away by the second generation .
90 % by the third .
how is it that the kings
have successfully defied that trend ?
you must tell me your secret .
winner takes all .
and the loser ?
none of your business .
really , i &apos;m all for being thorough ,
but at this point , you &apos;re just taking the nickel tour .
alexi koskov ,
a russian oligarch with an extensive collection
of stolen masterpieces .
the art crime division says
he &apos;s been trying to acquire the van gogh
since it disappeared in 2002 .
koskov &apos;s on the no @-@ fly list . how can he get into the country ?
he can &apos;t .
but his new acquisitions emissary ,
josephine sullivan ,
flew in from l.a. this morning .
she just checked in to the vanguard .
bring her in .
i presume you &apos;ve been downstairs .
i have .
reddington &apos;s a game changer .
you can &apos;t win .
i have no intention of quitting now .
even if you win ,
i only have a 16 % chance of losing -- one in six .
we know you &apos;re working as a representative for alexi koskov
to authenticate and purchase a stolen painting
from an illegal auction .
as such , we can charge you as an accessory after the fact ,
not only for the van gogh ,
but for every crime the king family has committed
to acquire the rest of their stock ,
including kidnapping and false imprisonment .
this is the bureau &apos;s file on you and your boss .
koskov is untouchable .
but you &apos;re right here .
her instructions were to introduce herself
to the concierge at the harleston read hotel .
owned by the king family trust .
everyone there is on their payroll .
that &apos;s it ?
she &apos;s supposed to ask for a room with a view of the capitol .
then what ?
she &apos;d get a room number .
after that , no idea .
she &apos;s never attended the auction .
beyond the hotel and the password , we have nothing .
that &apos;s not necessarily true .
they &apos;re expecting an american named josephine sullivan .
we can give them that .
undercover ? forget it .
i know you want him back , but there has to be another way .
if you can think of one , i &apos;m all ears .
okay . we do it .
but only as far as the hotel .
go there . get what you can .
i &apos;ll have a tac team standing by to hit the auction
as soon as you give us a location .
keen .
it &apos;s me .
what the hell are you doing calling me ?
got a new assignment . i &apos;m going away for a while .
what &apos;s her name ?
it &apos;s not like that .
it &apos;s not -- - me ?
yeah . i mean , no . i mean , it &apos;s --
it &apos;s , uh -- how you been ?
what do you think ?
i &apos;m in a lot of trouble because of you .
so , what ? that &apos;s it ?
berlin is out of commission , and you just ... get another gig ?
going away for a long time , and i thought i &apos;d ...
i don &apos;t know . i just wanted to say ...
i think the word you &apos;re looking for is goodbye .
look , i got to go .
it seems like the only thing we have in common anymore
is pretending to be someone else .
wait . you &apos;re going undercover ?
for how long ?
just a few hours .
just keep your ears open . try not to talk too much .
somebody asks you something ,
like some little thing that you don &apos;t know ,
and you think it &apos;s gonna trip you up , just sneeze .
sneeze ?
yeah . they &apos;ll say &quot; gesundheit &quot;
or &quot; god bless you &quot; or whatever ,
and 10 out of 10 times ,
they &apos;ll forget what they asked you .
i always thought you just had allergies .
goodbye , liz .
you &apos;ll need this for the elevator .
enjoy your stay .
thank you .
she should have a tracker , coms at least .
she &apos;s going in blind .
she can handle it .
she &apos;s in .
i have a reservation .
sullivan . josephine sullivan .
of course , ms. sullivan .
we have you in a one @-@ bedroom suite .
with a view .
excuse me ?
i requested a view of the capitol .
that can be arranged .
1861 . last elevator on the left .
1861 .
she &apos;s in elevator one . i repeat -- elevator one .
phone , purse , jewelry .
she &apos;s going down .
i repeat -- she &apos;s going down .
get a visual !
welcome , ms. sullivan .
thank you .
1861 .
it wasn &apos;t a hotel room . it was a parking space .
drink .
what is it ?
drink .
good heavens , earl .
you &apos;ve never had any feeling in your heart ,
but now it looks like
there isn &apos;t much going on below the waist .
i do all right .
the wheelchair is just a little memento
of our time together in bolivia .
no hard feelings , i trust .
just a few .
but this is only business , red .
besides , you warned me .
pigs eat ...
hogs get slaughtered .
all you had to do was listen .
but that &apos;s always been your problem --
all that money clogging your ears .
i told you to come with me that night out on the altiplano .
i had millions invested .
i couldn &apos;t just walk away like you .
poor choice of words given what those soldiers did to you .
i &apos;d hate to see you play the hog yet again , earl .
no , no , red .
you taught me an invaluable lesson .
dispassion
is the businessman &apos;s best friend .
one mustn &apos;t get emotionally involved in business .
you have to listen to the market .
you hear that ?
that &apos;s the market
telling me you are in demand .
what kind of a commodity are you ?
a wealth of secrets and information ?
or are you an impulse purchase
for a buyer to settle a score ?
you scare people , red .
how much would you pay
to be rid of your deepest fear ?
i &apos;ve always found fear to be my most valuable sense .
but then again , you kings demonstrate
a propensity for having more dollars than sense .
your son tyler was telling me --
&quot; winner takes all , &quot; i believe he said .
i &apos;m curious strictly from an estate @-@ planning perspective .
what exactly does that mean ?
good evening , ms. sullivan .
take what you want
from the family collection --
anything you need .
we want you to feel beautiful .
how thoughtful .
ladies and gentlemen .
welcome to the vicarage .
i would like to thank you
for traveling many a weary mile
to join us on this very special evening .
as is customary ,
you will have 30 minutes
to spend among the lots --
a taste to whet your appetite
and loosen your purse strings .
it begins .
hello ...
vincent .
see something you like ?
little vincent peretti , ms. sullivan ,
of the peretti family .
big vince has turned state &apos;s evidence .
there are half a dozen serbians and sicilians
willing to pay dearly
for the leverage to insure his silence .
so , i understand you &apos;re here on behalf of mr. koskov .
yes , i am .
it &apos;s rumored van gogh actually painted it at the beach ,
and up close ,
you can see the grains of sand bonded to the canvas .
remarkable .
so , which ivy league did you attend ?
it &apos;s no secret alexi fancies a certain breed .
columbia , then princeton .
really ? i &apos;m a princeton man .
the dinky was such fun , wasn &apos;t it ?
bless you .
oh , the dinky .
no matter the time of day ,
that damn train is always full
of hungover frat boys and co @-@ eds
in the throes of morning @-@ after regret .
is that who i think it is ?
well , i can see that you are a woman of good taste .
tyler , i believe the sheikh has questions
about your guidance chips .
the raymond reddington .
impossible .
you &apos;ve changed your hair .
you know each other .
unfortunately .
perhaps you &apos;d like to make a bid .
i &apos;ve heard he &apos;s far more trouble than he &apos;s worth .
it &apos;s probably easier to let someone else buy him .
let him be their problem .
i &apos;m here for the van gogh .
he &apos;s probably out of my price range , anyway .
not mine .
yaabari .
how are the boys ?
they still tell tales of the man in the hat
who burned down our compound .
i must say , you &apos;ve come up in the world ,
depending on how you look at it .
how did you manage to wrangle an invitation ?
who &apos;s backing you ?
i &apos;ll see you after the auction .
just give us the location .
i don &apos;t know anything . i &apos;m a hotel employee .
i arrange transportation .
i was doing my job .
your job is to shuttle people back and forth
to the king family auction .
that woman you sent off in the limo ?
she &apos;s a federal agent who was investigating a crime
to which you are now an accessory .
if anything happens to her , you &apos;ll be facing felony charges .
i told you .
i don &apos;t know anything .
the indictment -- it &apos;s coming down tonight .
you and i never had this conversation .
sir , uh , we may have a problem .
i was checking with d.o.c.
on josephine &apos;s transfer to hazelton .
they allowed her to make a call to her lawyer .
i gave an order .
if she gets word to her people , keen &apos;s cover is blown .
get d.o.c. on the line now !
anybody to bid ? now $ 3 million . who &apos;ll give me $ 3 million ?
i &apos;ve got $ 3 million here . who will give me $ 4 million ?
give me $ 4 million ? i got $ 4 million here .
for the bid now $ 4.25 million ?
$ 4 million going once , going twice .
sold for $ 4 million to the gentleman from maldives .
and now , ladies and gentlemen ,
one of the most exciting items of the night ,
a mainstay on the fbi &apos;s most wanted list ,
this gentleman has been on the list
longer than any other criminal !
a former naval intelligence officer ,
he possesses a wealth of classified information
and presides over one of the world &apos;s
most prosperous extralegal empires .
you may know him as the concierge of crime .
i present raymond reddington .
i will commence the bidding at $ 2 million .
able to bid now $ 2 million . who will give me $ 2 million ?
i &apos;ve got $ 2 million right here . who will give me $ 2.5 million ?
able to bid now $ 2.5 million .
thank you , ma &apos;am . able to bid now $ 3 million .
well , that &apos;s unexpected , but welcome .
what is she doing ?
she &apos;s supposed to be here for my van gogh .
thank you , sir . give me $ 5 million .
able to bid now $ 5 million .
thank you in the back . i got $ 5 million .
give me $ 6 million .
able to bid now $ 6 million . thank you , sir .
able to bid now $ 7 million ? able to bid now $ 7 million ?
it &apos;s only money , folks . able to bid now $ 7 million .
i &apos;ll take it , ma &apos;am . thank you .
able to bid now $ 8 million .
sir , mr. koskov called .
the woman who says she &apos;s his emissary --
mr. koskov said she &apos;s an impostor .
i knew it .
able to bid now $ 9 million .
bring her to me .
yes , sir .
it &apos;s only money , folks .
who will give me $ 9 million ?
$ 9 million .
i beg your pardon ?
$ 9 million .
i assume my money &apos;s good here .
$ 10 million !
certainly as good as his . $ 15 million .
$ 16 million .
come on .
i got to be worth as much
as that fake xuande ming vessel was .
$ 17 million .
$ 18 million !
sorry , santos ,
but those cat &apos;s eye chrysoberyls are brown , not green .
an expensive forgery , but a forgery nonetheless .
$ 20 million !
ignore that bid !
that hardly seems fair .
get him off the stage now !
does the gentlemen maintain his previous bid of $ 18 million ?
you &apos;re leaving money on the table .
what kind of business are you running here , earl ?
$ 18 million going once , going twice ,
sold for $ 18 million to the gentleman from cameroon !
give us the room .
sir ?
now , agent ressler .
i don &apos;t think you quite understand the situation .
you &apos;re assuming that you &apos;re a material witness
in federal custody
and are entitled to certain rights .
and while these things are true ,
what you don &apos;t know ... is you don &apos;t know me .
my doctors recently detected a mass
within the left hemisphere of my brain --
an inoperable tumor .
within a matter of weeks , it will kill me .
and this has clarified a number of priorities for me .
among those priorities ,
nothing is more important to me
than the safety of my colleagues .
i &apos;m committed that no one under my command
dies during the remainder of my watch .
and i will do anything within my power
to honor that commitment .
and since i quite literally have nothing to lose ...
i suggest you think long and hard
before answering my question .
where is elizabeth keen ?
come on . let &apos;s go .
excuse me .
i &apos;m looking for the van gogh . i paid a fortune for it .
all items are held till the end of the auction .
you need to --
come on . i &apos;m getting you out of here .
come on . stay with me .
stay right here , okay ?
take me with you -- please !
we have to get these people out of here .
how do you open this thing ?
lizzy , you need to go .
damn it ! what &apos;s the code ?
listen to me .
i was brought in through a series of tunnels that way .
if you hurry , you &apos;ll be miles away
before they ever realize you &apos;re gone .
take the boy and go .
you could be killed .
she &apos;s off the main floor . split up .
check every room .
help me !
lizzy , you did everything you could .
it &apos;s time to go .
go .
spread out !
we need to find that girl immediately .
come on .
okay , get in here . get in here .
where the hell &apos;s the peretti boy ?
i &apos;m sure your friend with the glass jaw
will enlighten you when he comes to .
what &apos;s in this for you ?
you wouldn &apos;t understand . you &apos;re not a king .
funny .
your father used to say that exact phrase
as if it somehow excused him from the use of logic .
what &apos;s in it for me ?
legacy and the king family fortune .
if this is just about the money , that would be so banal .
i bet your father would trade it all
for one more walk in the park with a good friend .
tell me ...
where are all your good friends now , huh ?
if you think there &apos;s a soul in this world
loyal to anything but your pocketbook ,
then you &apos;re the one
who &apos;s excused himself from the use of logic .
your prize .
let &apos;s find that kid !
vincent , i need you to run through that door .
see it ?
go as far as you can , okay ?
you &apos;re not coming with me ? you can &apos;t go back !
run . go !
go !
yaabari , before you exact your vengeance , consider this --
i could easily provide you
with enough influence and firepower
to crown yourself king .
isn &apos;t it time you stopped running through the forest
playing army with a bunch of kids ?
a generous offer ,
but i &apos;m here for more than just my vengeance .
i knew it . who &apos;s backing you ?
a man in johannesburg
has put a $ 40 million bounty on your head .
i plan to collect it .
good luck .
a lot can happen between here and johannesburg .
you will not be traveling to johannesburg .
you are not listening .
i said the bounty is on your head .
we shouldn &apos;t be doing this
with that fbi agent loose on the property .
she is clearly working with reddington .
why else would she bid so high ?
to apprehend him .
who wants reddington more than the fbi ?
either way , she &apos;ll be found , so stop making excuses .
you know i &apos;ve got you beaten .
you &apos;re getting too emotionally invested .
you realize who you sound like .
do you remember the first time i beat you at tennis ?
that was a long time ago .
i had you at match point three times ,
and all three times , i lost in an unforced error .
then you opened your mouth about how father
would never entrust the estate to a loser .
i aced you on the next serve .
right here .
try not to take it personally .
business is business .
in fact , raymond , i &apos;ve always been quite fond of you .
can &apos;t tell you what a comfort that is to me .
lizzy .
lizzy .
the handcuff key &apos;s in his back pocket .
okay .
someone &apos;s gonna come back .
we got to get out of here .
this is a fiasco .
that impostor took the place of my invited guest ,
she ignored the van gogh ,
drove up the price for reddington ,
and stole the peretti boy .
how is this any different from dubai --
that smuggler from the orient who had to be ejected ?
cost me $ 3 million at the deadline , and i still beat you .
the contractual deadline has passed .
the last tally stands .
master francis is the winner .
father , this is ridiculous . you must call this off .
you know as well as i do . there is no calling it off .
get on with it .
if that hammer falls on an empty chamber ,
you &apos;ll be dead before you hit the ground .
put it down .
earl .
someone should have put you out of your misery generations ago .
oh , my god . what are the odds ?
i &apos;ll leave the three of you to your own misery .
avoid the yard , be nice to your cell mate ,
and whatever you do , don &apos;t eat the franks and beans .
oh , and i don &apos;t need your lousy tux .
i want my clothes back .
agent keen says we recovered a ledger full of names
and dates from the king family estate .
bills of sale are being traced back 200 years .
i &apos;m glad something went well today .
what do you mean ?
i &apos;d been overseeing a fraud case
built against a med @-@ tech c.e.o.
i got word this morning he fled .
it &apos;s like he knew the indictment was coming .
nothing that should rain on your parade .
congratulate your team for me .
you can never do that again .
you &apos;re welcome .
i &apos;m serious .
you can ... never do that again .
promise me .
we took down dozens of wanted criminals ,
recovered millions of dollars in stolen property ,
and saved innocent lives .
i &apos;m not talking about that .
you .
you &apos;re talking about you .
you are so damaged .
you can &apos;t accept help from anyone .
has anyone ever helped you ?
is that why you are the way you are ?
because you don &apos;t feel deserving of it ?
is that why you can &apos;t be vulnerable for a second ?
i risked my life for you because i care about you .
deal with that .
and when someone does something nice ,
you &apos;re supposed to say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
but never do it again .
