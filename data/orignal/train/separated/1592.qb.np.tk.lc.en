you kissed me , remember , in the tent ?
then at the movie theater you held my hand .
i just , i don &apos;t get this , i don &apos;t get you .
do you think we made a mistake firing timothy ?
i was five months pregnant and i lost the baby .
and now , our twins &apos; birth mom is pregnant ,
and she &apos;s asked stef and me to adopt her baby .
are you guys gonna take ana &apos;s baby ?
i don &apos;t think so .
i think i &apos;m gonna ask her if i can .
you bribed them ?
i just wanted to make sure dad didn &apos;t go to prison .
daphne , where are you ?
look , i just wanted you to know
that i told the police about tasha .
that i took her , it &apos;s over ,
so you could stay with jude at the fosters .
what &apos;s going on , callie ?
i did something wrong and i couldn &apos;t tell you .
is this why you &apos;re going to live with robert ?
i just thought that if i left on my own it wouldn &apos;t hurt as much
as if you told me to go but it does .
ok , listen ...
it hurts so much .
look at me . nothing you can do is gonna make us not want you .
you &apos;re wasting your time , stef . you &apos;re too late .
well , i &apos;m not going down without a fight .
all we &apos;re asking is to go back
to the 180 day waiting period , or what &apos;s left of it .
and when the judge asks why ?
we say callie needs more time . to get to know robert .
and this just suddenly occurred to her ?
yes . while she was packing
to leave a home she feels safe and secure in
to go live with a man she hardly knows .
paperwork &apos;s done . the wheels are in motion .
so , stop them , marie .
no , it &apos;s my fault .
it &apos;s not your fault , it &apos;s robert &apos;s fault .
he knew that you were lying to
the judge when you asked to gand live with him .
ok , what if robert asked the judge to give callie more time ?
that &apos;s interesting .
why would he do that when he &apos;s so close to getting what he wants .
if callie asked him , in front of the judge ,
i mean , he wants to be seen like a loving father .
so , put him on the spot ?
would you be comfortable doing that ?
i guess . but , even if we get more time ...
all right , first things first .
i just don &apos;t feel like you
should be spending any more money on lawyers ,
no offense , if the judge is just gonna
make me go live with him anyway .
let us worry about the money , love .
the immediate goal right now is to keep you in this house ,
with us , for as long as possible .
thanks , maria .
i &apos;ll call the judge in the morning .
ok .
but look , callie &apos;s got a point .
this judge is clearly biased toward the birth father .
i hate to see you to spend more money jumping through hoops
just to delay what &apos;s inevitable .
i have no intention of waiting for the inevitable .
you got something up your sleeve ?
oh . sorry .
it &apos;s ok . i &apos;m just brushing my teeth .
so , did they talk to you about the tour yet ?
uh , no , not yet , but , i &apos;m like 110 persent sure i &apos;m not going .
i &apos;m so sorry .
stop . it &apos;s not the end of the world .
have you told the band ?
not yet .
i &apos;m gonna do it tonight , i figure , all together .
you &apos;re not gonna give lou a heads up ?
uh , i figure safety in numbers .
i have to brush my teeth !
get in line .
i &apos;m so sick of sharing a bathroom !
seriously ?
what ? i gotta brush , too .
no ! out ! we &apos;re at capacity !
what &apos;re you so spun out about ?
oh , nothing , just that callie &apos;s moving out ,
um , i can &apos;t find anyone to dance on my dance team ,
jesus is going to boarding school ,
but other than that , i &apos;m awesome .
you &apos;re going to boarding school ?
you &apos;re going to boarding school ?
no ... maybe ... probably not .
they offered him a scholarship .
academic ?
no . wrestling . and the school &apos;s in colorado .
i thought you said i could go .
i never said i &apos;d be happy about it .
and you &apos;re probably gonna have to move in with jude .
jude ? why ?
to make room for the baby .
what baby ?
what baby ?
it &apos;s not for sure .
they &apos;re gonna do it . moms wanted a baby and ana &apos;s having a girl
and she &apos;s our sister , and it &apos;s perfect .
how could they not ? it &apos;s like fate .
we &apos;re gonna be late .
it &apos;s not gonna happen .
how do you know ?
i talked to moms .
good , it means i don &apos;t have to move in with jude .
i mean , i guess that &apos;s too bad about ana .
and mariana . she &apos;s gonna be really upset .
why haven &apos;t they told her ?
i don &apos;t know if they told ana .
forgot mascara !
you know what ? you should ask emma to be on the dance team .
yeah , right .
i &apos;m serious .
she used to be a cheerleader , in junior high .
emma ?
did you get the email from marie ?
no .
how many times have we told them not to leave the milk out ?
what &apos;d it say ?
the judge will see us at 12 : 30 .
does that work for you ?
i guess it has to .
i really don &apos;t like callie having to put on a show .
it &apos;s not a show , love . this is what she wants .
it sure as hell &apos;s not what robert wants .
i don &apos;t see any world in which
he &apos;s going to ask the judge to delay his getting custody .
you never know .
by the way , jesus wants us to
reschedule the meeting with the flintwood scout .
i thought he said he wasn &apos;t ready to leave home ?
apparently , mariana thinks it would be good for him . so ...
you know , monte went to boarding school .
oh , did she ? didn &apos;t know that .
she said it saved her life .
hmm . had a troubled youth , did she ?
she said it was the only reason she got into a good college .
she probably went to harvard .
princeton , actually .
well , la @-@ de @-@ da . since we &apos;re running all our big family decisions
past your new boss , maybe i should meet her .
i thought you wanna , run it by mike ?
that &apos;s funny .
seriously , you should invite her to dinner .
like we have time to entertain . i gotta go .
i love you . all right .
i love you . i &apos;ll see you later .

you were a cheerleader ? !
that was a long time ago .
two years is not a long time .
look , please try out for my dance team .
look , i quit cheerleading and i started wrestling
because i didn &apos;t want to be the silly girl on the sidelines .
i wanted to be in the game .
we are the game . we &apos;re not cheering anybody else on .
we &apos;re a competitive dance team . and you &apos;re very competitive .
i &apos;m just don &apos;t feel comforble exploiting my sexuality .
i &apos;m asking you to dance , not to strip .
look , if you &apos;re not gonna do it for me ,
do it to avenge all the victims of mean girls everywhere .
and i know you &apos;re one of them .
um , do you have any gum ? i didn &apos;t brush my teeth this morning .
exhale .
no .
come on .
oh , my god , that &apos;s disgusting .
i told you !
i &apos;m just kidding . but seriously , you need some gum .
hey , so , you want to hang out after school ?
we could do our homework ?
sure . you want to come over ?
yeah , i &apos;ll meet you at the bench .
hey , brandon .
i got your email and i talked to our friends over at idyllwild .
unfortunately , it &apos;s too late , they gave up your spot .
yeah , i figured .
however , when i explained to them
why you didn &apos;t jump at the scholarship ...
wait , you told them ?
now they &apos;ll never consider me .
that &apos;s not true .
they said they &apos;d make another spot for you .
if you audition .
you said you played the bach prelude perfectly .
no , it wasn &apos;t perfect .
it just wasn &apos;t a disaster . my extension &apos;s not the same .
so , practice . it &apos;s not like you &apos;ve got anything to lose .
... but there &apos;s many motifs within silas marner .
it &apos;s a book that explores a plethora of things , including
religion , community , love ,
deception , status , and redemption .
so , to answer your original question ,
we will be critically examining each of these themes
page by page , and chapter by chapter .
i &apos;ve just got a few minutes . what &apos;s going on ?
your honor , i understand that callie is feeling confused
about her decision to come live with me and my family .
and because i want her to feel absolutely certain
and secure in our home , i think she needs more time .
so , you &apos;re asking to go back to the waiting period ?
yes , your honor . i still strongly believe
that my daughter belongs with me ,
but i &apos;m willing to wait until
we &apos;ve had a chance to get to know each other better .
callie , this is what you want ?
yes , sir .
and ladies , i &apos;m assuming this is ok with you ?
yes , your honor .
we ... we just want callie to feel safe .
ok . we &apos;ll go back to the original plan .
with one amendment .
i think once a week visitation is probably not enough time
for callie to get to know her father , so in addition ,
i &apos;m going to give mr. quinn every other weekend as well .
you ok , cal ?
yeah .
you should get to class .
we &apos;ll talk more tonight , ok ?
love you .
love you .
love you .
what the hell was that ?
why would robert ask the judge to give callie more time
before callie even asked him ?
he knew why we were there .
my bet is he wanted to play the hero , for callie &apos;s benefit .
well , now she &apos;s going to spend every other weekend with him .
do you think it was really worth it ?
yes , because it bought us time .
for what ?
指使孩子从父母或监护人的监护中解脱而获得合法权利
to get callie emancipated .
if we can get callie emancipated
before the waiting period is up ,
then she &apos;s no longer a ward of the state .
she &apos;s considered an adult
and wouldn &apos;t need anyone &apos;s consent to be adopted by us .
and what if robert finds out ? or the judge ?
no , emancipation petitions aren &apos;t heard in family court .
and robert wouldn &apos;t find out .
if callie doesn &apos;t tell him ,
which is asking her to do exactly what we accused robert of .
to give her a choice , not take it away .
which is what robert is trying to do .
this is a ... this is a very gray area .
and so was not reporting callie and brandon as accessories to a kidnapping .
they were just trying to do the right thing .
so are we .
how long does it take to get emancipated ?
it &apos;s ... it &apos;s gonna be tight .
it &apos;s gonna be tight .
so this is what you meant by first things first .
and you just decided at this was the plan ,
without discussing it with me ?
i just ... didn &apos;t want to get anyone &apos;s hopes up ,
in case we didn &apos;t get the time .
callie &apos;s gonna have to want to do this .
we can &apos;t pressure her into it .
we won &apos;t .
ultimately it is up to her .
let &apos;s talk to her about that tonight .
oh . hey . i was looking for you .
uh , monte , this is my wife , stef .
it &apos;s so nice to meet you . i &apos;ve heard so many great things .
likewise . in fact , i was just saying
that we should have you over for dinner some time .
i &apos;d love that .
how about tonight ?
tonight ?
i &apos;m sure she has plans .
actually , i don &apos;t . but , are you sure ?
yes .
yes , we &apos;d love to have you .
so , if we don &apos;t find four girls today , we &apos;ll just have to ...
concede defeat .
it &apos;s not defeat to drop out .
of course it is . quitting is way worse than losing .
yeah , well , i think we &apos;re in trouble .
keep an open mind . you never know .
ok , i &apos;ll do it .
no way .
um , hey , isn &apos;t that your foster sister ?
hey . everything ok ?
yeah . why ?
what are you doing here ?
aren &apos;t these open auditions ?
are you ... ? oh my god !
oh , god !
sorry .
i didn &apos;t mean to scare you .
my dad ... said i could practice here .
the piano . he said you wouldn &apos;t be home .
is everything ok ?
uh , yeah . i ...
... just got this letter , returned to me , it &apos;s silly .
well , maybe the person moved ?
no . it &apos;s not the first one they &apos;ve sent back .
listen , um ...
i &apos;m really sorry i took that money from you .
i shouldn &apos;t have done that .
no , i ... i shouldn &apos;t have ...
no , you were just trying to help your dad . he &apos;s a good man .
he didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
i was lying . i don &apos;t even remember why now .
i &apos;ll try to pay you back .
no , it &apos;s really ok .
my dad gave me money , so ...
then , i &apos;ll add it to all i owe him already .
well , i should get out of here , let you practice .
it &apos;s ok , really .
no , i &apos;m supposed to be apartment hunting .
your dad &apos;ll be really happy you &apos;re playing piano again .
five , six , seven , eight .
ok , everybody got it ?
yeah .
got it .
ok , well , just have fun and bring it .
that was fantastic !
thank you ! give us just a moment .
so , what &apos;d mariana promise you to audition ?
i &apos;m getting her first born .
oh , i &apos;m just being supportive ,
even if it was slightly humiliating .
so emma &apos;s awesomei
she rocked it
and grace was better than i thought .
for sure and ivy ?
moves really well .
they &apos;d never make kaitlyn &apos;s team .
but we &apos;re not kaitlyn &apos;s team .
exactly . we &apos;re every woman .
um , but the two on the right ... ?
mm , no bueno .
and . um , callie ?
was awesome .
ok , so , my two ladies on the right ,
i &apos;m sorry , but thank you for auditioning .
everyone else ... you &apos;re in !
wait , me ?
yes , you !
i &apos;m so excited !
we &apos;re a team !
hey , you ready ?
so , what &apos;s the deal with daria ?
what &apos;d you mean ?
are you guys gonna like ... keep hanging out ?
well , i think it &apos;s ... it &apos;s good
&apos;cause ... my dad &apos;s cool with us .
&apos;cause you have a girlfriend ?
well , we all have fun together don &apos;t we ?
i guess .
so , daria and taylor are sneaking out tomorrow night .
通常还会用到鸡蛋和粪便 画面太美请自行脑补
they &apos;re gonna go tp some girl &apos;s house and they want us to come .
get out . i have to study .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
i can &apos;t concentrate with you two in here .
we &apos;ll be quiet .
i can hear you breathing . go use the dining room .
oh , sorry , you guys , i need to set the table .
we &apos;re eating in here ?
monte &apos;s coming for dinner .
the principal &apos;s coming here ?
yeah , you wanna stay , connor ?
no , thanks .
ok , well , you guys can study out back , please .
i put the water on ,
but i don &apos;t know why we don &apos;t just order in , love .
because it &apos;s expensive
and i don &apos;t want the principal of the school
to think we feed the kids take @-@ out every night .
and frankly , i wish you hadn &apos;t invited her .
we have so much going on , and we need to talk to callie .
talk to me about what ?
ok , maybe we can try the living room .
uh , hey , guys , we &apos;re having a little bit of a private conversation .
uh , ok , sorry .
ok , yeah , i should probably get home anyway .
see you later , connor .
there &apos;s nowhere to be alone in this house .
hey , if we sneak out , tomorrow night after tp &apos;ing ,
we could hangout , you know , by ourselves .
so what would i have to do ?
first we get you off probation , your hearing is next week
and your p.o. sees no reason that it won &apos;t go well .
then , you have to prove that you can pay for an apartment
and support yourself .
i can &apos;t live with you ?
you can . the court needs to see that
you can afford to live on your own .
in case we were to ever asked you to leave ,
which we would never do .
an apartment costs a lot of money .
yeah . you &apos;d have to get a full time job and go to school .
but remember , this is just temporary .
yeah , as soon as you &apos;re emancipated , we can adopt you right away .
and you wouldn &apos;t have to maintain any of that .
and you do need to keep this from robert ,
which we don &apos;t feel good about .
but sometimes , callie , the end justify the means .
this is the only way we know ,
to give you the choice that you deserve .
so brandon , your mom ...
are you both &quot; mom ? &quot;
i &apos;m &quot; mom , &quot; she &apos;s &quot; mama . &quot;
your mama tells me that you might
be going on tour this summer , with your band ?
uh , yeah , i don &apos;t think that &apos;s happening anymore .
oh , why do you think that ?
well , it isn &apos;t , right ?
well , we have some things to discuss ,
but as far as we &apos;re concerned , you &apos;re good to go .
so monty , i understand that you went to boarding school .
mm , yeah , for my last two years of high school .
is boarding school as wild as they say it is ?
ah , well , not the one that i went to , unfortunately .
i &apos;m sorry jesus couldn &apos;t join us .
i &apos;d love to hear more about flintwood .
you really see jesus going to military school ?
nothing &apos;s been decided .
where &apos;d you go to college ?
well , i studied pre @-@ law at princeton
and then i decided i did not want to be a lawyer
so i got my graduate degree in business .
oh , from where ?
from yale .
princeton and yale .
that &apos;s impressive .
what you do is impressive , as far as i &apos;m concerned .
you certainly don &apos;t need a degree from yale
to give out speeding tickets .
i &apos;m sure you do far more than that .
i want to go to an ivy league school .
not that we could afford it .
yeah , maybe you can get like a dance scholarship , you know .
ha ha .
when are we having this dance @-@ off ?
next week . and guess who joined the team today ?
don &apos;t .
callie !
really ?
wow , dance team just got a lot more interesting .
can i please come to your rehearsals ?
can we talk about timothy ?
oh , sweetheart , why don &apos;t
we just wait for the school assembly for that .
i don &apos;t mind .
i don &apos;t know if he got fired
because he made us read that article on education reform ,
but i found it very informative .
it laid out both sides of the debate
and if the point of common core is to make us deeper thinkers ,
then timothy should be like ... on their poster .
it &apos;s true . he &apos;s the best teacher i &apos;ve ever had .
me , too . except for music .
he challenges us to consider all points of view
and to think about , like ,
not just what we think about something ,
but why we think it .
i really look forward to his class . we all do .
no other teacher has made me want to learn as much as he does .
sorry i &apos;m late .
mercury &apos;s in retrograde , man .
ok , we &apos;re all here .
so , what &apos;s up ?
i just wanted to tell you that i don &apos;t think ...
i can &apos;t go on tour .
five , six , seven , eight ,
step , flick , pop , pop , drop , jump ,
hands , hair , hips , ok ?
again . five , six , seven , eight ,
step , flick , pop , pop , drop , jump .
ok ... wait , wider legs , a little bit .
like this .
drop , jump , hands , hair , hip hip .
drop , jump , hands , hips .
ok , but slow it down . it &apos;s supposed to look sexy , like this .
hip hip .
i can &apos;t do that .
well , sure you can , you just flip your hair and smile like :
ooh , i know you want me .
yeah , no , i ...
try it .
ok .
see , that was almost it but actually say it .
ooh , i know you want me . i &apos;m sexy .
i &apos;m not saying that .
ok , well , loosen up a little bit .
you &apos;re so tense here .
mariana , stop .
sorry .
i have like a lot of homework i think .
yeah , sure . we &apos;ll pick this up in rehearsal tomorrow .
great .
awesome .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
oh , that &apos;s good , thanks .
you have a gorgeous home ,
and your kids are amazing , what a lovely family .
oh , thank you . remember that next time one of them decides
to stage a walk @-@ out .
mariana &apos;s very impressive .
i was really moved by the way she talked about timothy .
she &apos;s very special .
can i ask that ...
did the kids know that he was your donor ?
they did . they did . it was supposed to be anonymous .
since we are sharing it , it was really funny though
because jesus came home unexpectedly ,
and found timothy &apos;s deposit in our bathroom .
it was just ...
oh , my .
that must have been ...
yeah .
yeah , extremely ... extremely awkward .
but , as you can see , they have a lot of respect for timothy ,
and were very supportive .
i &apos;m very sorry for your loss .
you know , now , seeing how special mariana is ,
i can understand why you &apos;re so torn .
torn about what ?
about adopting ana &apos;s baby .
oh , we are ? we &apos;re torn ?
did you have anything to do with moms letting me go on tour ?
i might have put in a good word .
i wish you hadn &apos;t done that .
i thought you wanted to go .
i did , but that was like before when i couldn &apos;t ...
i got an audition to idyllwild .
they &apos;re gonna give me another shot .
that &apos;s great .
well , no , because i can &apos;t do both .
and i really want to go to idyllwild .
so , tell the band . i &apos;m sure they &apos;ll understand .
i &apos;m not sure lou will understand .
which is why lied and told them
that my moms changed their minds about letting me go .
i ... i think ... do you want to know what i think ?
mm , not really .
what i do want to know is
what the hell are you doing on mariana &apos;s dance team .
i felt bad for her and so i was just trying to be supportive .
i never thought i &apos;d make it . i &apos;m not a good dancer .
just tell her then .
i &apos;m pretty sure she knows .
then you don &apos;t want to be on the team .
i can &apos;t . she needs six dancers . i &apos;m stuck .
well , i think you should just be honest with her .
did i ask what you think ?
well , tell you what , if you will , i will .
all i did was tell her that
i was struggling with this decision .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
why didn &apos;t you tell me about your secret emancipation plan ?
is this what we &apos;re going to do ? tit for tat ? ok .
i &apos;m not gonna feel bad about sharing something with a friend .
oh , so now she &apos;s a friend ? that &apos;s interesting .
i don &apos;t have that many people to talk to .
so talk to me .
honey , listen , i thought you were very clear about the fact
that you didn &apos;t want to adopt ana &apos;s baby .
well , i &apos;m not .
i &apos;m worried that mariana will feel like
we don &apos;t love her as much as we say we do .
that &apos;s ridiculous .
ok . good talk . thanks .
hey , i don &apos;t mean that you are ridiculous .
mariana knows how much we love her , come on .
she was already worried that i &apos;d love frankie more than her .
and if i wanted a baby that was a part of me ,
why wouldn &apos;t i want one that &apos;s part of her ?
why wouldn &apos;t we want a baby
as beautiful as our mariana ?
it &apos;s not that simple .
isn &apos;t it ?
no , it &apos;s not .
we can &apos;t adopt ana &apos;s baby because we feel guilty .
i don &apos;t mind talking about this some more with you , i don &apos;t .
but what i do mind
is not knowing what you &apos;re thinking or feeling
and hearing about it from another person outside this family ,
before you share it with me .
we have to tell each other everything .
we &apos;re in all of this together .
timothy ... what are you doing here ?
well , i had a very nice talk with our new principal last night .
turns out she &apos;s not a dilettante after all .
i just found out we have a new , old english teacher .
what can i say , your daughter made a very convincing argument .
maybe she should be the lawyer .
i don &apos;t think it hasn &apos;t crossed her minds .
thank you . thank you .
do you want to have lunch today ?
love to .
great , let &apos;s do that .
ok .
so , um , there &apos;s something i wanted to tell you , um ...
i pulled a muscle in my leg .
oh my god , really ?
yeah , i can barely walk .
oh , my god .
i don &apos;t know if i can dance .
oh my god .
yeah . i mean i can try ...
no ! you don &apos;t want to really risk hurting yourself .
i &apos;m so sorry .
don &apos;t be .
i mean , i &apos;m really disappointed .
so am i.
i really wanted you to be on the team .
i really wanted to be on the team .
what are you going to do , you need six dancers .
there &apos;s got to be someone i can find to replace you .
i mean , it &apos;s not gonna be easy .
yeah , because i &apos;m such an amazing dancer .
are you sure ?
i &apos;m positive . trust me .
ok . i didn &apos;t actually hurt my leg .
duh . you can always be honest with me , you know .
yeah ? well , honestly , never do that sexy face again .
you mean , this one .
yeah , no , it freaks me out !
&apos;cause you know you want me .
stop it ! you &apos;re gross .
so you can go on the tour .
yes .
but i want to go to idyllwild , if i can get in .
classical music has been everything ...
... and ...
... i &apos;m not ready to give up on it .
without at least trying to be what i was .
i didn &apos;t know you were coming by .
well , we wanted to tell ana , in person .
tell her what ?
that we &apos;re adopting the baby .
hey , uh , mariana ?
will you shut the door ?
sounds serious .
i ... saw ana at my dad &apos;s .
moms aren &apos;t gonna take her baby .
did she tell you that ?
no , i don &apos;t think she knows yet .
or maybe she does .
how do you know ?
i just know .
but please act surprised when they tell you .
i don &apos;t understand . they wanted a baby .
not ana &apos;s baby .
even if she &apos;s your sister .
they don &apos;t know anything about who the father is
and they &apos;re still grieving frankie .
you can &apos;t take this personally , ok ?
the reason i &apos;m telling you this is because ana was really upset .
i guess she &apos;s been sending letters to her parents ,
trying to make amends ,
but they keep returning them , unopened .
do you remember , them ? your grandparents ?
no , i don &apos;t ... i don &apos;t think we ever met them .
well , i was thinking , since moms aren &apos;t taking the baby ,
that if her parents knew that ana was pregnant ,
maybe they would take it ?
and that way , at least she &apos;s being raised by her grandmother
and you can get to know her .
be a part of her life .
they live pretty close .
yeah .
i thought if you &apos;d want to write to them
you &apos;d have their address .
maybe he &apos;s not coming .
maybe he got caught sneaking out .
there he is . you made it .
who &apos;s house is this anyway ?
our friend , brooklyn .
it &apos;s her birthday tomorrow .
and she hates her parents . best present ever .
there it goes .
i got it !

hey , love .
what &apos;re you doing ?
you had robert investigated ?
when ?
when we ... when we first found out about him .
and this is why he was so willing to give callie more time ?
because he &apos;s having an affair and you blackmailed him ?
i used it , yeah .
&quot; the ends justify the means ? &quot;
i did what i had to do to protect our daughter , lena ,
and i &apos;m not going to apologize for it .
so much for being in this together .
where &apos;d they go ?
who knows . maybe they &apos;re having sex .
they &apos;re having sex ?

you can &apos;t break in to your own house .
he thinks i &apos;m spending the night at your house .
