okay , hold still , honey .
i &apos;m afraid you &apos;re going to hit me again .
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m just putting this time .
i &apos;m not the strongest golfer ,
and i think it &apos;s holding me back in business .
too bad deals aren &apos;t closed in a trampoline park .
i &apos;d just lazy @-@ back into a rudolph
into a quadriffus right up the corporate ladder .
hey , dad , you coming to my play tonight ?
&quot; your &quot; play ? you only painted the sets .
yeah , and michelangelo &quot; only &quot; painted the sixteenth chapel .
maybe don &apos;t keep your face so close to the paint cans .
sorry , buddy , i &apos;m getting a golf lesson
and then i &apos;m playing with a client ,
but i &apos;ll try to make your next performance .
phil !
little busy .
oh , you always do this .
you cram stuff in the freezer without thinking about it .
i opened the door , and a frozen turkey almost fell on my foot .
i keep pulling it to the left .
are we sure the house is level ?
are you not the least bit sorry ?
i could have broken a toe .
honey , i &apos;m sorry for dozens of things
every day that actually happen .
if i start apologizing for things that don &apos;t happen ,
how productive of a person would i be ?
hey , your golf pro &apos;s here !
hola , hola .
hello , everybody !
thanks so much for the quick lesson , jay .
just think of me as a blob of clay ,
waiting for your experienced hands
to caress and coax me--
first rule of golf-- shh .
okay .
good .
if you &apos;re going to be a grump all day ,
why did you even say that you were going to teach him ?
because he &apos;s how my grandkids get food .
there he is .
ay , thank you so much for taking care of the baby .
cam has me running all kinds of errands for the play .
yeah , well , you gotta keep your eye on the caller i.d.
i have to go to the dry cleaners to pick up the costumes ...
then i have to go get the dry ice for the fog machine .
and maybe i &apos;ll go get cam some flowers .
oh , alex can help you with all that .
oh , perfect . okay , let &apos;s go .
we can &apos;t be late ,
or there won &apos;t be any dry ice in the house .
形容众人都为某事垂泪 没有一人眼睛是干的 &#93;
good one .
what ?
you guys have fun . go on . nothing to worry about .
i got it handled here .
be careful .
don &apos;t worry , just keep your mouth open .
we &apos;re fine . it &apos;s fine .
okay , can i have everyone &apos;s attention , please ?
reuben ? hit me with a spot .
that &apos;s a little harsh . throw a pink gel on that .
that &apos;s great . perfect .
all right , i will be recording today &apos;s rehearsal ,
but don &apos;t let that make you self @-@ conscious .
i &apos;m only using it to pinpoint your mistakes .
secondly , i have granted full set access
to maureen schick ,
who will be reviewing your show tonight .
uh @-@ oh , she &apos;s vicious .
our last music teacher , mr. namagachi ,
never recovered from her article , &quot; anything blows . &quot;
but in fairness , i saw that production ,
and the lead soprano was an absolute disaster .
no offense , sophie .
you &apos;ve blossomed since then , sweetie , okay ?
no batteries in her mic , okay ? great .
and lastly , marcus talbot .
guys , he &apos;s feeling a little under the weather .
fear not . he &apos;s home resting his instrument ,
and he will be ready for the show tonight .
but i will need a phantom for this rehearsal .
so , anyone ...
i guess i could help .
i don &apos;t know how marcus ever got the lead .
but i know how he got sick--
from chewing all that scenery .
this was my chance to earn it back
from that insincere phony .
but first , a silent prayer for our fallen captain marcus .
godspeed , old friend .
this is boring . is he dead ?
no , he &apos;s not dead . he &apos;s just sleeping .
babies need to sleep a lot
so they grow bigger and stronger and smarter .
hey , mrs. d. hey , lucy .
every time .
well , that &apos;s a nice shirt .
thanks . i designed it myself .
it &apos;s my best seller .
i &apos;m so jealous you know what you want to do with your life .
i wish i was inspired like you .
or , you know , aim higher .
open yourself up to some new experiences
and find out what--
oh , my g--
are you okay ?
fine . just ...
slipped on one of your father &apos;s stupid golf balls .
good , you woke him up .
maybe he &apos;s hungry . i just fed him ,
but i don &apos;t think bottles can live up to the real thing .
maybe i can calm him down .
oh , that &apos;s very sweet of you , but he &apos;s super fussy today .
and when babies are fussy , they--they ...
yeah , i &apos;m good with babies .
you should see him play peek @-@ a @-@ boo . he &apos;s amazing .
no . i &apos;m good .
i know a guy in chicago-- he &apos;s amazing .
dang it !
are you kiddin &apos; me ? that divot flew out of there like a rocket .
i decided to go gentle with phil ,
which didn &apos;t come easy to me ,
because i &apos;ve always been a bit of a drill sergeant
when it comes to sports .
and with the new baby ,
gloria &apos;s been buggin &apos; me to have more patience .
but come on . he &apos;s been alive a month .
how hard is it to support your own head ?
what the hell ?
hello , boys .
what a sweet ride , pepper .
what are you guys doing here ?
i &apos;ve been golfing for a few weeks .
pepper &apos;s been teaching me .
i grew up golfing with my father ,
the great chaim saltzman .
or as he was known around the clubhouse ,
chad treadwell .
well , we should play together as a foursome .
first time that word &apos;s creeped me out , but okay .
care to make it interesting ?
i think your pants have already done that .
how &apos; bout a hundred bucks ?
me and phil will play you and mitch .
fun . mitchell , care to go first ?
oh , i ...
okay . yeah . i &apos;ll-- i &apos;ll give it a whirl .
running into my dad was no accident .
i wasn &apos;t the best athlete growing up ,
and my dad never missed an opportunity
to point that out .
&quot; nice throw , nancy ! &quot;
nancy was our neighbor .
i could never throw as well as she could .
i &apos;d pretty much given up on beating my dad at anything
until pepper dragged me to a golf course one day .
turns out i wasn &apos;t half bad .
six months &apos; practice later ,
i was ready to kick my dad &apos;s ass .
i knew just how i was gonna do it , too .
i &apos;d walk up to the tee all nervous ,
do a few clumsy practice swings ,
and then i &apos;d hit that ball dead center ,
watch it arc through the sky , land on the green ,
and totally wow my dad .
oh , no .
wow .
* it &apos;s over now , the music of the night *
okay . great job , everyone .
thank you . but it was really everyone .
give yourself a round .
oh , marcus &apos;s mom . shh .
fingers crossed .
why is it taking you so long ?
how hard is it to paint a wall ?
a lot harder than your so @-@ called singing .
at least this is supposed to be flat .
i once saw a monkey paint a wall .
yeah ? did you say , &quot; good job , mom &quot; ?
mono ? but he &apos;s my lead .
my career depends upon this .
the district is this close to cutting my funding ,
and my fingers are very close together right now .
* nighttime *
just let me talk to marcus .
* sharpens *
he would never turn his back on this company .
we are like family here .
* stirs imagination *
i &apos;m sorry . we &apos;re going another way .
* silently the senses *
* abandon their defenses *
any news about marcus ?
why are you whispering ?
saving my voice , just in case .
oh . well , marcus is out .
but luckily , i found an even better phantom right here .
i wouldn &apos;t say better , but since you did ...
luke . i was just about to ask him .
luke ?
he knows the show ,
he sings like a nightingale ,
and he has a certain theatrical madness in his eyes
you cannot teach .
that &apos;s just from all the paint .
oh . uh , luke ?
stop it . are you trying to spook him ?
what are you talking about ?
he &apos;s already intimidated by you after you criticized his sets .
oh , please . i could not be the only person
that found his unicorns distracting .
let me talk to him first .
if i can &apos;t get the job done , then you step in ...
kind of like the way an understudy
would traditionally take over when the lead finds himself--
yeah . just do it .
hey there , luke . or should i say , phantom ?
you wanna get to the point ?
&apos;cause i &apos;m kind of on a schedule ,
and this paint keeps making me fall down .
marcus is out , and cam wants you to take over .
really ? well , i do know all the songs .
stop trying to talk yourself out of it . you &apos;re doing it .
it &apos;s only for two nights .
you &apos;re doing it again , looking at the negatives .
look at the bright side . what if you don &apos;t screw up ,
humiliate yourself , and get mocked forever ?
i &apos;d get mocked ?
only by the cool kids .
but who needs them ?
you &apos;re one of us now .
the theater geeks .
* vermont is snowy *
* las vegas is showy *
* and those are the capitals i remember *
what if this had been at the top of the stairs ?
i mean , i really could have gotten hurt , right ?
uh @-@ huh . lily , i made you lunch .
peanut butter . my favorite .
it &apos;s just hard to believe
that somebody could be so oblivious
to a situation that is clearly dangerous .
look at us . we &apos;re like a little family .
i know .
we &apos;re the parents .
i know !
i know what his response would be--
&quot; but you &apos;re fine . why you getting all bent out of shape ? &quot;
but what if i wasn &apos;t fine ?
what if he walked through the door ,
and he thought he had created a horrible accident ?
oh , this is so fun .
good . she &apos;s gone .
grab your camera .
i &apos;m gonna make his little hand flip us off again .
no , it &apos;s not just me .
three mothers are giving the party ,
and we need all our names in the card--
gloria pritchett , sara leonard , dee cho ...
what do you mean that there &apos;s no more room ?
dee cho must go on .
okay , come on . that one had to be on purpose .
okay , we &apos;ll be there then .
they won &apos;t be ready until one more hour .
you maybe wanna take a shift carrying this dry ice ?
no , i just had a baby .
i &apos;ve watched you carry manny to bed .
i know what we can do to kill time .
my psychic is around the corner .
please tell me you just said &quot; sidekick . &quot;
i used to think that i knew everything , too .
we &apos;re going for a reading .
i &apos;ll let her know that we &apos;re coming .
you have got to be kidding me .
i &apos;m trying to remember the telephone number .
what is happening to me ?
all right , what are we , 3 strokes down now ?
i think someone needs a pepper talk .
how is that a pepper talk ?
you need to get angry . play aggressive .
that man &apos;s been mitch @-@ slapping you and your entire life .
i know , but ... he &apos;s being so nice to phil ,
and phil is way worse than i ever was .
i don &apos;t know .
maybe he &apos;s not the unsympathetic jerk he used to be .
okay , so you got off to a rough start .
let &apos;s simplify .
on this shot , i want you to just concentrate
on bending your knees .
you got it ?
bend my knees .
bend my--
dang it ! straighten my knees .
son of a bitch , you &apos;re a hopeless embarrassment .
you &apos;re kickin &apos; up more sand than a sea turtle layin &apos; eggs .
did you see that ? !
yeah , that wasn &apos;t half bad .
hey , listen , i &apos;m sorry i yelled .
no , no , no . that &apos;s what i needed .
my old tumbling master in college used to yell at me all the time .
it just made me better .
really ?
oh , yeah .
he &apos;d say terrible things about my manhood ,
he &apos;d throw the chalk bag at me ,
he &apos;d call me and taunt me over the summer to keep me sharp .
so bring it , jay !
you stink , phil .
you &apos;re the worst thing to happen to golf
since they let people wear shorts .
you just told me to--
no , that &apos;s part of it .
did you hear that ?
and he wasn &apos;t just talking to phil .
he was talking to 10 @-@ year @-@ old you
and 12 @-@ year @-@ old you and ...
suck it , nancy !
i was just trying to help .
just listen with an open mind .
she doesn &apos;t believe in psychics .
it &apos;s not just psychics .
it &apos;s all unquantifiable phenomena .
i &apos;m going to save you some time .
she doesn &apos;t have a boyfriend .
maybe not now , but soon .
you see ?
that means--
shh . go on .
you are going to meet someone special .
i see a handsome man on a horse ,
like a knight .
well , i am going to a renaissance fair this weekend .
yes , i know .
there &apos;s no renaissance fair .
even if there was , i wouldn &apos;t go .
i &apos;d be the laughingstock of the young astronomer &apos;s club .
but i couldn &apos;t tell gloria her fortune @-@ teller was a fake ...
not until i had a little more fun .
i see that you &apos;re smiling . you &apos;re enjoying yourself .
i know it sounds crazy ,
but could you please tell me what happened to
myy bunny buttons , who ran away when i was 5 ?
never had a bunny . hate bunnies .
i see a farm ...
with a red barn .
i know who &apos;s in the barn !
it &apos;s like scrabble with haley .
after a while , you &apos;re just playing against yourself .
okay , everyone , look sharp , please !
the press is here !
as i was saying , maureen , i was really at an advantage
having seen the broadway production .
i was able to learn from their mistakes .
for example , in my production ,
the phantom appears in the first scene ,
because after all , it &apos;s not called
&quot; christine and raoul of the opera . &quot;
i have two sources telling me
your lead is home with chicken pox .
uh , mono .
make that three sources .
oh , damn , you &apos;re good .
um , permission to speak ... off the record ?
denied .
okay , fine . well , then ...
see for yourself in just a moment .
tonight a star will be born .
cam ?
not now , manny . i &apos;m birthing something .
sometimes in the theater ,
the real drama happens before the curtain rises .
observe .
luke dunphy ,
how would you like to play the starring role
in cameron tucker &apos;s andrew lloyd webber &apos;s
&quot; phantom of the opera &quot; ?
nope .
luke dunphy , is it true you passed
because of creative differences with an overbearing director ?
say nothing to that jackal !
manny , what happened ?
i tried my best .
he started hyperventilating just thinking about it .
i guess some people just aren &apos;t comfortable taking center stage .
okay . well , maybe we can pump marcus
full of whatever they gave those bike riders .
he &apos;s too sick .
but don &apos;t worry , cam , you &apos;ll think of something .
it &apos;s always darkest right before the ...
reuben , could you keep that thing still ? !
okay , well , i guess we only have one option .
i &apos;ll do it .
hmm ?
i was gonna say play the role myself ,
but , you know , i guess it really should be about the kids .
now if i had tripped on your father &apos;s golf ball ,
say ... top of the stairs ,
probably would have--oh , no !
taken out some pictures .
look what you &apos;ve done , phil !
mom !
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s finally sleeping .
hey , we should take a picture of all of us .
then once you get going , you know , you just can &apos;t stop .
you &apos;re taking everything down with you .
and then , to make it perfectly clear
to your father what happened ,
i &apos;ll put the golf ball right here ,
because some people can &apos;t see the danger
unless it &apos;s right under their nose .
having kids is fun .
and easy .
maybe this is what i should do with my life .
oh , he &apos;s such a little angel . i want one .
haley , little dude needs his sleep .
i wanted to tell haley
about the dangers of starting a family too early ,
but what could i say
that couldn &apos;t be said better by a screaming baby ?
mom !
oh , sorry .
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s wrong with me today .
mom !
still good .
sorry .
would you just get out of here ?
yeah . yeah . totally sorry .
it &apos;s my--
sorry .
when he wakes up , we should all go out for ice cream .
i was thinking the same thing .
what are you doing ?
minding my own business .
wait . ice cream might ruin lily &apos;s dinner .
so ?
so i spent all afternoon cooking .
i thought ice cream would be fun .
all you &apos;ve done today is have fun
while i did all the work .
i &apos;m just trying to make the most of it with these kids .
i don &apos;t have as much time with them as you do .
what , by spoiling them ?
who &apos;s that ? who &apos;s texting you ?
it &apos;s just about work .
typical . even when you &apos;re here , you &apos;re not here .
why are you this upset about ice cream ?
if that &apos;s what you think this is about ,
then you haven &apos;t heard a word i &apos;ve said !
i @-@ i &apos;m confused . why do we even have these kids ?
i don &apos;t know !
i &apos;m going home !
good !
oh , fantastic .
one stroke down on the final hole .
it &apos;s such a big putt . such a big , big putt .
i like big putts , and i cannot lie .
money .
you know what &apos;ll be sad ? you doing all that practicing
to finally be able to beat your old man ,
and coming up just short .
i almost ...
can &apos;t watch .
you &apos;re up , ace .
i was the same way with my father .
it &apos;s always complicated .
not for mine . my dad was just supportive .
never missed a tumbling meet
or a break @-@ dance brawl .
heck , i &apos;d set up the sound system for our school assembly ,
he &apos;d be the loudest voice in the crowd .
&quot; hey , everybody ! check out my son &apos;s equipment ! &quot;
aw .
yeah .
hey , seriously , good luck .
you played good . i &apos;m proud of you .
really ?
we should do this again sometime .
don &apos;t listen to him .
he &apos;s &quot; cat &apos;s in the cradling &quot; you .
what ?
he &apos;s playing on your emotions
so you lose your edge .
i do it to my son all the time .
did he say &quot; son &quot; ?
yes . he &apos;s a navy seal .
oh , i &apos;ve said too much .
what &apos;s &quot; cats in the cradle &quot; ?
you know , that song about the dad who misses
all the important moments in his kid &apos;s life ?
stay strong ,
just like kyle did in yemen .
oh , my god , i &apos;m a sieve .
all right , mitch . showtime .
five . six .
a @-@ five , six , seven , eight .
yes !
a hundred bucks !
oh , we did it !
now i can afford the shirt that matches these pants .
so ... drinks in the clubhouse ?
can &apos;t . my kid &apos;s in a play .
yeah , i &apos;m meeting a client for another round of golf .
hey , if you see luke , will you give him a hug for me ?
will do . hey , i was serious
about we should play again sometime .
it &apos;s a crazy thing
that if i &apos;d been less of a hard head when you were a kid ,
we could have had 20 years in this dumb game .
no , it was half my fault .
i mean , i @-@ i used to be pretty sensitive .
so y @-@ you really weren &apos;t
&quot; cat &apos;s in the cradling &quot; me back there ?
of course not .
how have i not heard of this song you keep talking about ?
you have . it &apos;s the worst .
it &apos;s the schmaltziest .
unbearable .
i &apos;ll play it on the way back . i have it on my ipod phone .
* and the cat &apos;s in the cradle *
* and the silver spoon *
* little boy blue and the man on the moon *
* when you coming home , dad ? *
* i don &apos;t know when , *
* but we &apos;ll get together then . *
* you know we &apos;ll have a good time then *
i should have golfed with you sooner , dad .
i never made the time .
luke !
i need to call my son .
what time is it in damascus ?
why don &apos;t i just draw them a map ?
ready to play , phil ?
i can &apos;t , carl ! my boy &apos;s sets are in a play !
i get the feeling that something wonderful
has happened to someone you know .
yes , it &apos;s manny .
he got the lead role in the school play .
yes , that &apos;s it .
okay , i think you might have met her halfway on that one .
do you feel that ?
a presence has just entered the room .
or the a.c. kicked in .
gloria , i have to say something .
it &apos;s your abuela .
which one ?
is she smoking a pipe , or is she smoking a cigar ?
a cigar .
my mother &apos;s mother .
i miss her so much .
she says she misses you , too .
i wish that she was here now to see fulgencio joe .
she has seen him ,
and she says he is beautiful .
he is , isn &apos;t he ?
tell her that i love her .
she knows .
thank you so much for that .
you see now ?
i think i do .
* the music of the night *
okay , manny , quick question .
did you forget the notes i gave you
or just choose to ignore them ?
where are you going with that ?
we need an extra one up front .
mr. namagachi decided to come .
oh , you mean the disgraced teacher i replaced
suddenly has an interest in this production ?
he &apos;s parking his peugeot right now .
wow , the vultures are officially circling .
okay , manny , it &apos;s no secret
that you were not my first choice for this ,
or my second .
but it &apos;s not too late for you
to make this your very own phantom .
so i want you to watch what luke did ,
and copy that .
* silently the senses *
* abandon their ... *
he was glorious .
every note , every nuance ... i was transported ,
and i was furious .
but my quarrel wasn &apos;t with luke .
it was with god .
save a seat for your sister .
excuse me . i think that &apos;s my seat .
dad ! what are you doing here ?
are you kiddin &apos; me ?
my grandson paints the sets for a play ,
and i &apos;m not gonna drive in from florida , hmm ?
is this one taken ?
all yours .
that sweatshirt ...
i &apos;m on the tennis team .
we &apos;re the valley science knights .
the knights ?
* nighttime sharpens *
* heightens each sensation *
what ?
* darkness stirs *
that &apos;s luke .
no .
* and wakes imagination *
* silently the senses *
* abandon their defenses *
that could have been you out there .
no , it wouldn &apos;t have been right .
i &apos;m sure you would &apos;ve gotten some of it right .
not what i meant .
hey , thanks for meeting me here .
no reason we can &apos;t mix business
with a little pleasure . am i right ?
i &apos;m just excited to find someone who enjoys this sport
as much as i do .
i &apos;m gonna be straight with you , carl .
you got a ton of inventory to move ,
and you &apos;re in need of a serious realtor .
hup hup !
so how firm are you on your commission ?
as i think you can see , i &apos;m quite flexible .
i &apos;ll be honest , phil , i like you .
i think i &apos;m ready to move forward with this .
really ? well , i &apos;m thrilled .
hey , you know , we could make this official .
nice form , son !
i &apos;m talking about that contract , of course .
you still got it , dad .
that &apos;s my dad .
hi .
