that &apos;s a ...
nail .
it &apos;s embedded several inches into his frontal lobe .
you know , i &apos;m at an increased risk of having a seizure .
so is this something you do now ?
you get high ?
noah has a medical marijuana card .
i took some of jesus &apos; adhd pills .
that &apos;s like taking speed . are you crazy ?
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re still seeing nick !
what does it matter
if he thinks that i &apos;m his girlfriend
as long as he &apos;s locked up ?
callie &apos;s caused brandon a lot of trouble
from the time she showed up .
and what about this aaron kid ?
is she yanking his chain too ?
hey , anybody home ? police .
you heard gunshots . you were amped on adrenaline
and i was lying on the ground .
of course you thought that he still had the gun .
but he didn &apos;t .
i &apos;m gonna talk to robert today , change my statement .
they &apos;re gonna think you &apos;re lying to cover my ass !
there was other dna on the murder weapon
besides martha johnson &apos;s and kyle &apos;s .
why did kyle &apos;s lawyers never see this ?
because detective gray didn &apos;t want him to .
detective joe gray .
i understand you &apos;re interested in an old case of mine .
if we can place another suspect at martha johnson &apos;s house
on the day she was murdered , then we might get a judge
to order them to give a dna sample .
like our curb painter doug harvey .
i want to go to juilliard
more than anything .
promise me that you will not hold back
on this audition because you feel
that you have an obligation to this girl .
do you have any idea what it takes to study here ?
what do i do then ? break up with her ?
so rita called me and she &apos;s up in sacramento
talking to like , representatives and stuff ,
and the good news is that justina &apos;s bill died
before it even made it to a vote .
that &apos;s because of you , callie .
yeah , but ...
so apparently , they &apos;ve got like , a ballot measure .
you know , when they put something out to the voters .
like they did with prop 8 ?
yeah , exactly .
so they &apos;re calling it the foster care reform bill ,
but , you know , of course it &apos;s just the same terrible law
that puts most of government funding towards privatization .
they &apos;re relentless , aren &apos;t they ?
yeah , and of course people are gonna vote
for something called &quot; foster care reform . &quot;
yeah . i mean , it sounds good to me .
exactly , and the only way to get voters to see
that there &apos;s , you know , a better way to do things
is to put a different bill on the ballot ,
and they &apos;re calling it jack &apos;s law .
oh .
that way , voters can at least ... see the difference ?
yeah ?
sounds like a good idea .
maybe the bills just cancel each other out ?
even that would be better than
justina getting her law passed .
so , they need 500,000 signatures
to get the new bill on the ballot ,
so i was thinking
since we &apos;re all already going to the bayfest
to see brandon &apos;s big reunion with someone &apos;s little sister ...
what if we had like a booth
and , you know , like , collected signatures
and ... and took donations ?
there &apos;s gonna be a ton of people there .
can i go ? i ... i mean , i know i &apos;m grounded ,
but it &apos;s not like noah &apos;s gonna be there , so .
you &apos;re not grounded from family things .
of course you can go .
uh , hey , mama ?
where &apos;s my refill ? i &apos;m almost out .
they haven &apos;t sent it yet ?
no .
uh , okay . i will call them tomorrow .
oh , my god .
what ?
i ... i got an email from ... from juilliard .
and ?
open it . open it , love .
i ... i ...
what ... where are you going ?
where is he going ?
what ?
w ... why isn &apos;t he doing anything ?
oh , my god !
oh , my god !
i ... i got in !
i got in ! oh , my god !
oh , my god , i got into ...
oh , my ... oh , my ...
oh , my god !
oh , my god !
let me see , let me see !
come on ! okay , here .
i ... i didn &apos;t read it all . i ... i couldn &apos;t read it all .
oh , my god ! look at you !
can &apos;t believe he did it .
you know ? it &apos;s one of those things that
you talk about for years and years and years ,
and then it finally happens , and ... and ...
i have to find a way to pay for it .
we will .
and i &apos;m sure he &apos;s gonna get a really good aid package .
yes , and hopefully i will make detective ,
so that will take some of the pressure off too , right ?
honey , i don &apos;t want you to do that just for the money .
i &apos;m not , i swear .
i ... i do really enjoy this line of work , all right ?
and ... and to be quite honest ,
it &apos;s time .
you know , it &apos;s long past time for me to get off the beat .
well , i know i &apos;m gonna sleep better .
i know , love .
me too , you know , if for no other reason
than i won &apos;t have to be on my feet all day ,
so hopefully my ... my knees won &apos;t hurt all the time ,
and ... and ...
won &apos;t have to put on that damn uniform anymore .
hey , what &apos;s the matter with the uniform ?
it has been an honor to wear it everyday
for the past 20 years , but it &apos;s ... it &apos;s polyblend
and it &apos;s hot and it &apos;s incredibly unattractive .
it &apos;d be fine with me if i never saw it again .
never ?
oh my .
you have the right to remain silent .
do i ?
and you better start ...
right now .
okay .
and after 20 years on the beat ,
i think that , uh , i think i finally realized that my talents
would probably be put to better use elsewhere , so .
well , you know what ? i think you &apos;re right .
we &apos;re always looking for more female detectives ,
and to find someone with your experience and commitment ,
well , we &apos;d be lucky to have you .
thank you .
of course , i &apos;ve gotta run it up the ladder , but
yes .
i think everything looks very good .
and it doesn &apos;t hurt that you &apos;ve already got
a recommendation from one of our most decorated veterans .
someone put in a recommendation for me ?
yeah . gray .
joe gray .
i figured you knew him , asked him to .
yeah , i know him . yup .
and in the end , if so many people had to die ,
维吉尔
well , that was just a byproduct of our hero &apos;s journey .
the romans were pretty merciless that way .
okay , more on this tomorrow .
make sure you &apos;ve done your reading .
mariana , a word ?
yeah ?
so ...
i read your paper .
it &apos;s not your best work .
i expect a lot more from you .
oh , my god .
i ... i &apos;ve just ...
i &apos;ve been so busy with robotics ,
i &apos;ve gotten so far behind .
i &apos;m just ... i &apos;m just trying to catch up .
you had the same time as everyone else .
please , if ... if you can ,
can i just have this weekend to make it better ?
i ... i promise i will fix it . please . it &apos;s just ...
this will ruin my gpa .
okay .
but i want it monday . first thing .
and it better be good .
okay .
hello ?
hey . it &apos;s me .
um , i &apos;ve got some good news .
what ?
i &apos;m home .
you are ?
well , i mean , just for the weekend .
they &apos;ve got me on house arrest , so ...
i can &apos;t leave .
that must be nice , to be home for a little bit .
yeah , it is .
and you know the best part ?
you can come over .
i can finally touch you again .
bad interview ?
no , great interview , in fact .
got a big , fancy detective puttin &apos; in a good word for me .
gray sent over a recommendation .
the hell is that ?
does he think that he can just buy me , buy my silence ?
i &apos;m just gonna owe him , be his bitch ?
he obviously doesn &apos;t know you very well .
so , i mean , what are you gonna do ?
are you gonna take yourself out of the running ?
no .
that &apos;s evidence that benjamin torres was 14 years old
when molloy molested him .
give that to your friend in vice
and tell him that
gray threatened to have benjamin &apos;s parents deported .
see what he can do with it .
okay . are you sure you want to do this ?
it sounds like gray is keeping an eye on you .
yeah , i &apos;m sure .
i missed you .
i &apos;m so glad ... you &apos;re home .
where are you going ?
you fell asleep .
no , i didn &apos;t .
it &apos;s okay .
i &apos;m sorry . i just ...
i haven &apos;t been sleeping like , at all .
hello . just wanted to make sure everyone was decent in here .
don &apos;t worry .
okay . oh , mat , congratulations , by the way .
on what ?
getting into berklee .
very happy for you .
thanks .
you got into berklee ?
i didn &apos;t even know you applied there .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
it &apos;s no big deal .
i ... i don &apos;t even know if i want to go .
you should probably take a nap .
call me later if you want .
so ...
what do you have for me ?
whatever it is , give it to me quick .
uh , this place is giving me flashbacks to high school .
is this a hint ?
are you trying to tell me something ?
it &apos;s from doug harvey .
the curb painter ?
yeah .
did you break into his house ?
callie , what the hell ? you could have gotten yourself killed .
well , i didn &apos;t , so now we can see
if harvey &apos;s dna matches anything on the murder weapon .
no , we can &apos;t . it &apos;s not admissible .
what &apos;s the point ? not to mention the fact
that you broke a bunch of laws to get it .
okay , what was i supposed to do ?
no , if you could have heard kyle
when he told me that they were sending him to folsom early ....
i &apos;m telling you , if we can &apos;t figure out
how to give him some hope at least ...
he &apos;s gonna ...
okay , um ...
we &apos;ll get it tested .
at least we &apos;ll know .
as long as you promise not to do anything stupid again .
okay .
callie , i &apos;m serious .
what ?
nothing .
what ?
i said nothing .
was it nick ?
jesus !
whoa , he &apos;s home ?
you can &apos;t go see him .
yeah , i know !
i &apos;m serious .
mariana , you can &apos;t go see him .
i &apos;m not going to . god .
well , then text him .
i will .
yeah ?
do it now .
no , i &apos;ll do it later .
no , you won &apos;t .
yes , i will , jesus !
i &apos;ll do it as soon as i &apos;m done with this stupid paper !
now leave me alone !
okay .
see now , no sooner do i try and help you out
you go and make me regret it .
nobody asked for your help .
too high a price as far as i can see .
all i did was ask you to stay out of it .
and i did .
handing over evidence to the guys in vice
doesn &apos;t seem like staying out of it to me .
so making detective , that &apos;s not worth anything to you ?
not this .
what about having a job at all ?
keep talking .
give me more to go to internal affairs with .
it &apos;s funny you should mention ia .
i was thinking they &apos;d be very interested
in finding out how you tried to cover for your ex @-@ partner .
or was it your ex @-@ husband ?
no , wait , it &apos;s both ,
when he was being investigated for shooting an unarmed man .
that &apos;s one thing about ia .
they hate being lied to .
you &apos;re not the only one
who could do a little digging , officer .
you have a good night now .
帮助前寄养孩子获得新判决
okay .
you &apos;re raising money for kyle too ?
i thought it couldn &apos;t hurt .
wow , nice location , callie .
i think we could do some damage from here , huh ?
um , where do you want this ?
uh , just across the back . thanks .
hey , aj , come give me a hand .
hey ! oh , i love them !
thank you so much for doing this !
of course .
yes !
wow . there ... there &apos;s two of you .
that &apos;s ... crazy .
um , i &apos;m gonna go grab the rest of the chairs .
okay , who is that ? he was cute .
oh , that is aaron .
you know , the intern i told you about
from the juvenile justice center .
oh , so he &apos;s smart too .
nice !
hey , jude , i ...
hey , what &apos;s up with callie and that guy ?
nothing .
why are you asking me that ?
just looking out for you .
look , mike , i know you don &apos;t like callie .
okay ? but i do ,
and i &apos;m gonna keep seeing her .
and if you don &apos;t want me to keep seeing her ,
well , that &apos;s too bad .
i &apos;m gonna be 18 soon , and if you don &apos;t want me
staying under your roof anymore , i guess ...
i &apos;ll just move on .
did-- did your sister tell you that i was home ?
you want to come in ?
look , mariana doesn &apos;t want to say this to you
because she doesn &apos;t want to , you know , hurt your feelings
i guess , but ...
she doesn &apos;t want to be with you anymore .
she &apos;s with mat now ,
so you have to leave her alone .
okay ?
why didn &apos;t she tell me this herself ?
because she &apos;s afraid of you .
so we &apos;re calling it jack &apos;s law
for my friend who was killed in the system .
uh , so we just need enough signatures
to get the bill on the ballot .
i was a foster kid ,
so believe me , it &apos;s really important .
oh , we already signed the foster care petition .
you did ?
yeah , about an hour ago over by the entrance .
that &apos;s weird .
we just got here .
yeah , i know .
or maybe they just didn &apos;t want to sign .
yeah , maybe .
so there &apos;s this other bill
that like , puts all the money into like ,
businesses instead of for the kids ,
but we &apos;re trying to fight that , so maybe you could sign ?
um , i don &apos;t think so .
i gotta meet my friends .
sorry .
couldn &apos;t close , huh ?
帮帮这个曾被寄养的孩子
thank you . thanks .
hi , are you interested in foster care reform ?
we just , uh , we need some signatures
to get our bill on the ballot .
uh , yeah , sure .
thanks .
would you also consider donating to help
kyle snow get a fair trial ?
he was wrongly convicted of murder .
no , i won &apos;t .
okay .
you know , you shouldn &apos;t be doing that .
you &apos;re raising money for a murderer .
okay , well , he &apos;s not a murderer--
yes .
he is .
i &apos;m troy johnson .
martha was my grandmother .
see , a friend of mine called me this morning
to tell me about this , and i didn &apos;t believe it .
you have to stop .
i just got my mother back
after years of her being so depressed ,
she couldn &apos;t even get out of bed .
i &apos;m sure this has been really hard for you all ,
but kyle is a victim here too , okay ?
he did not do this .
yes , he did .
no , he didn &apos;t . the detective on your grandmother &apos;s case
made sure that he was convicted
even though there was evidence
that points to somebody else , okay ?
don &apos;t you want the person that &apos;s responsible to be found ?
look , kyle is guilty .
i know that , and so did the jury .
and i &apos;m sorry if you have convinced yourself
of some cockamamie theory ,
but please let this go .
for my family &apos;s sake .
hi there . can we talk to you for a minute
about foster care reform ?
okay , this is so frustrating .
what is going on ? why aren &apos;t you working the crowd ?
you &apos;re much better at harassing people than i am .
i , uh ...
detective gray came to visit me
as i was leaving work yesterday .
again ?
yeah ,
and he , uh , threatened to go to ia
if i didn &apos;t drop the whole thing .
he knows about how i covered for mike after the shooting .
how does he know about that ?
i have no idea .
does this mean you could lose your job ?
honey ,
you don &apos;t have to make detective .
that &apos;s fine . we &apos;re gonna be fine .
but if you lose your job ...
you have to let this go .
hey , listen , there &apos;s a child molester
still out on those streets thanks to detective gray .
and an innocent kid is sitting ,
rotting away his life in jail .
how am i supposed to walk away from that ?
there are other people who can take this on .
well ... let the jjc handle it .
isn &apos;t that what they &apos;re there for ?
they &apos;re not gonna get justice for benjamin torres , lena .
they &apos;re not .
this is an issue of integrity for me , lena .
why can &apos;t you see that ?
you-- you are the one
who &apos;s always saying that we can &apos;t save them all .
and you know what ? sometimes you have to ...
you have to compromise your integrity .
it sucks , but it &apos;s true .
you do what you have to do for the sake of your family .
excuse me , uh , can i talk to you
for a second about , uh , foster care reform ?
hi , do you have a moment to talk about foster care--
do you have a moment to talk about serious reforms
needed in the foster system ?
sure .
my team and i are collecting signatures
to get a really important bill on the ballot
and would ...
wait a minute , i know you , don &apos;t i ?
i mean , berkeley ? that &apos;s eight hours away ,
and he didn &apos;t even tell me he was going to apply ,
and it &apos;s because he knew
that i was going to be upset . that &apos;s why .
at least it &apos;s not one of those
schools that he was looking at on the east coast .
and my grandparents live nearby , so i can visit ,
and-- and-- it &apos;s-- it &apos;s just a year , right ?
are you ... okay ?
no .
maybe . i don &apos;t know . i &apos;m gonna get these guys .
excuse me .
are you familiar with jack &apos;s law ?
uh , we &apos;re trying to get another reform bill placed on the ballot .
so justina &apos;s people are here too .
for real ?
yeah .
guess we weren &apos;t the only ones with the brilliant idea
of getting signatures here .
but i am not going to let them have the upper hand .
i &apos;m going to work harder and i need a new petition .
already ?
damn , that is impressive .
but of course , if we were all as cute as you ,
i &apos;m sure we &apos;d be on our fourth petition too .
are you serious right now ?
i &apos;m standing right here .
what ?
you know what . stop hitting on my girlfriend , man .
i know you kissed her .
and i &apos;ve been trying to be chill with you ,
but every time i turn around , you &apos;re making moves .
aj--
stay in your lane , man .
for real .
aj , he &apos;s just playing .
well , that &apos;s enough playing .
does he always get this worked up ?
seriously ?
you really want to start something with me ?
you &apos;re about half my size on a good day , little man .
i will break you , so watch your damn mouth .
okay , okay , you know what , um ...
aaron , he has a point , okay ?
and you need to stop pressing people &apos;s buttons ...
thank you .
but you need to shut the hell up
and stop being such a jerk .
hey , hey , hey , hey , what &apos;s going on ?
oh , good ! yeah , yeah , yeah , great !
i &apos;m sure you think that i &apos;ve created all this drama ,
that i &apos;m just yanking everyone &apos;s chain , right ?
callie , i don &apos;t know--
no , mike .
it &apos;s actually none of your business
and i don &apos;t care what you think ,
so you need to stay the hell out of it , okay ?
dammit . aaron !
what was that ?
come on , mike . you always blame her for everything .
what ?
it &apos;s not fair , and you know it .
aj , i have nothing against callie personally .
i-- i &apos;m just-- i worry .
look , let &apos;s be clear about one thing .
you &apos;re family .
hey , you &apos;re not going anywhere no matter how i feel
about your love life .
okay ? you always have a home with me .
hey , can we stop soon ? i &apos;m starving .
we just had lunch .
excuse me , sir ?
would you sign our petition for foster care reform ?
some people are weird .
no kidding .
come on . let &apos;s go .
excuse me , would you two--
you got what you wanted .
aaron went home .
good .
you are such a jackass .
how am i the jackass here , callie ?
you &apos;re the one that pulled away from me
when i tried to kiss you this morning .
and then you went and comforted him
after all those shots he took at me .
okay , i didn &apos;t pull away because of aaron ,
i pulled away &apos; cause mike was there .
and yeah , i-- i went after him because of what you said .
it was so shady .
what ? i didn &apos;t say anything that wasn &apos;t true .
calling him out for his size ,
obviously he &apos;s sensitive about that .
well , obviously i &apos;m sensitive
about some dude hitting on my girlfriend .
okay , aaron is trans , aj .
god .
how--
anybody want to sign for jack &apos;s law ?
anybody ?
jack &apos;s law ?
i &apos;ll sign .
i-- i , uh ...
you &apos;re not ...
i &apos;m-- i &apos;m not ...
not supposed to see you .
i won &apos;t tell if you won &apos;t .
so , you know , i was thinking ,
and berkeley isn &apos;t so bad .
i mean , it &apos;s not ideal , but it &apos;s not that far
and they &apos;ve got a really good robotics program ,
so i was thinking maybe i could apply next year--
i &apos;m pretty sure berkeley doesn &apos;t have a robotics program .
yes , it does . i-- i looked it up .
it &apos;s a really good one , in fact .
pretty sure berklee college of music
doesn &apos;t have a robotics program .
berklee college of music ? where is that ?
boston .
come on . we &apos;re up soon .
callie ?
so i called justina marks .
you know her , right ?
yeah .
well , to tell her how well we were doing
and how weird it was that there &apos;s this
whole other group collecting signatures here ,
and , well , she asked me to pass along a little message .
she told me to tell you that opening people &apos;s mail
is a federal offense .
i didn &apos;t--
well , she knows you posted
a picture of the check she got online , so ...
pack up , go home , and stop all this
or she &apos;s gonna have you arrested .
so , uh , listen , i handled the whole nick thing .
what ?
what do you mean you handled it ?
what-- what did you do ?
i-- i went to see him , and , um--
you went to see him ?
yeah , and we talked
man to man , and i-- i made it clear
that you &apos;re not his girlfriend anymore , that you &apos;re with mat ,
and you don &apos;t ever want to see him again .
oh , my god , why did you do that ?
you &apos;re so stupid !
now he &apos;s gonna be mad at me
and i &apos;m gonna have to-- i--
mariana , it &apos;s-- it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s gonna be fine .
you &apos;re fine .
you don &apos;t know that .
hey , what &apos;s going on ?
i can &apos;t do this . i--
can &apos;t do what ?
just any of it .
i can &apos;t ...
keep trying to help people ,
and just have it blow up in my face again . i can &apos;t .
it &apos;s hard to help people sometimes .
you know , it &apos;s hard to do the right thing ,
and sometimes people get hurt , sometimes you get hurt .
but it &apos;s no excuse though .
you gotta keep doing what you &apos;re doing .
and you &apos;re doing a great job , you hear me ?
hey , can i go up with you guys ?
um , on stage ? why ?
captain roberts , this is stefanie adams @-@ foster .
um , i want to leave this on
your voicemail so that i don &apos;t change my mind .
i &apos;d like to see you on monday .
something i &apos;d like to take to ia .
hey , how &apos;s everyone doin &apos; ?
sorry , i-- i know everyone &apos;s here to see some music ,
and the amazing someone &apos;s little sister is about to play .
i just want to take a few seconds to talk
about my friend jack downey .
he was let down by the foster care system
and died because of abuse in an unsafe home .
uh , and i &apos;m here today because i want to make sure
that his death was not in vain .
see , there &apos;s two different bills circulating today ,
and one of them is sponsored by the people
that are directly responsible for jack &apos;s death .
so , i just-- i &apos;m asking you , please ,
please take one minute from your day today
to help us get jack &apos;s law on the ballot this fall .
thank you .
and now , someone &apos;s little sister .
thank you . we &apos;re someone &apos;s little sister .
uh , well , some of us are .
our keyboardist is actually on a little vacation right now ,
so we asked our old friend , brandon foster , to join us .
and , uh , brandon actually just got some really exciting news .
he will be attending juilliard this fall .
i think he deserves a round of applause for that , yeah ?
in honor of this most momentous achievement ,
uh , we wanted to play a song that he just wrote .
it &apos;s called collateral damage .
it &apos;s work .
hey , monty , why are you calling me on a saturday ?
what &apos;s going on ?
hey , uh , i &apos;m sorry , i can &apos;t hear you .
i &apos;m gonna step away and call you back .
he &apos;s here .
who ? who &apos;s here ?
nick .
okay , where are you ?
mariana .
uh , i &apos;m ... i &apos;m by the bathroom .
mariana , what &apos;s going on ?
mariana !
i ... i gotta ...
hey , sorry about that .
so what &apos;s going on ?
let me . i &apos;ll check inside .
okay .
hello ?
hey , are you here ?
are you at bayfest ?
what ?
listen , are you at bayfest ?
did you come here looking for mariana ?
i have an ankle bracelet , dude .
i can &apos;t leave .
she &apos;s not in there .
then where the hell is she ?
wait , what &apos;s going on ?
hey , what &apos;s going on ?
i think that she might be taking your pills again .
wait , wait , wait , wait , what do you ... what do you mean &quot; again &quot; ?
have ... have you seen mariana ?
uh , no , babe . not for a while . why ?
because we can &apos;t find her anywhere .
and ...
and , um , she might
have taken some of my pills .
look , i ... i didn &apos;t know anything about it ,
but i &apos;m worried because she called me and she said that she ...
she thinks she sees nick here .
n ... nick here ? how could he possibly be here ?
listen , i &apos;m sorry .
i just ...
you should have told me about aaron before .
i mean , i wouldn &apos;t have gotten so jealous .
why ? &apos; cause he &apos;s trans ?
that &apos;s a very ignorant thing to say .
what ?
aaron is no less of a man than you are ,
