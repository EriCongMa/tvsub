i came over to apologize ...
i hope that you and your mom are okay .
i have a message for you .
ali wants to meet me tonight .
did you tell anyone about this ?
i can &apos;t believe you followed me here .
what &apos;s the deal with mona ?
we met in a group at school .
there &apos;s a new counselor and he &apos;s actually cool .
mona is the devil , and i would really appreciate it
if you didn &apos;t encourage them being together .
it &apos;s time to share , andrew .
i want some of your study aid ,
the kind with the child @-@ proof cap .
dad !
i &apos;m coming , baby .
dad .
who eats pie with beer ?
mr. fitz ?
a boysenberry pie and beer ,
that &apos;s what you ordered ?
the police used dental records
to prove that body was alison &apos;s
and we know it wasn &apos;t .
i was at the dentist
and i think that i got treated by &quot; a. &quot;
one of you just please look inside my mouth .
&quot; i told you . dead girls can &apos;t smile .
stop looking . &apos; a. &apos; &quot;
i need it . there &apos;s no other choice .
i know i told you to avoid her
but you &apos;ll have to get in touch with her .
and when you do ...
yes .
that is exactly what you say , nothing more .
she can &apos;t know yet .
do you think you can get to it ?
i &apos;ll be careful .
i &apos;ll call you back on this phone
and tell you where to take it .
your friends just walked in .
shana ?
shana , tell me you can get it .
i have to go .
guys .
have you heard her from since ?
can we trust her now ?
if ali does , i guess that means we should try .
shana has too many faces to trust .
i &apos;ve been keeping count and running out of fingers .
we all got a finger you can use .
it &apos;s not the nice kind .
so is your dad going to be okay ?
they &apos;ll monitor his heart for a while to make sure ,
but in the long run , he should be fine .
except the part where shana gave him a heart attack .
it wasn &apos;t a heart attack .
the doctors said his chest pains were caused from anemia .
besides , i don &apos;t think it was her .
i mean shana led me to ali .
why would she turn around
and punish me for trying to find &quot; a &quot; ?
and we know that &quot; a &quot; is a dude .
maybe shana &apos;s helping this dude .
wasn &apos;t she seen sneaking around wren &apos;s apartment
shipping boxes to melissa ?
sure , but let &apos;s say it &apos;s not shana , you know .
could be somebody else ?
maybe it &apos;s somebody who &apos;s working on the play with mr. fitz .
i was the first crew member he brought on .
and he asked you to meet him after school , right ?
yeah , he asked me to copy audition scenes
while he was out running an errand .
he said he &apos;d come by if he could .
what about you , aria ?
what about me ?
i was just wondering if maybe since you and jake broke up ...
yeah , that doesn &apos;t mean we &apos;re back together .
look , look , i &apos;ve been taking some time for myself .
ezra and i haven &apos;t talked in a really long time .
do you think you could ask him ?
no .
no asking , no following , no taking a look .
&quot; a &quot; gave us an order in my mouth .
i &apos;m just trying to help emily figure out who was chasing her .
yeah , but emily already said that ezra wasn &apos;t there .
i don &apos;t know what kind of help he would be .
you &apos;re right .
i &apos;m cutting you off . you &apos;re over @-@ caffeinated .
what ? it &apos;s herbal tea .
spencer , i &apos;m about to have a breakdown , okay ,
and your floppy foot is gonna push me over the edge .
so go sit over there , okay . we &apos;re all really tense .
tense ?
&quot; a &quot; knocked me out ,
shot me up and played post office
between my teeth .
&quot; dead girls can &apos;t smile . &quot;
if we don &apos;t keep trying to help ali ,
she &apos;ll never be able to come home .
yeah , and the longer that she &apos;s out there on her own ,
the easier it is for &quot; a &quot; to get to her .
we &apos;re not doing anything .
we &apos;re just gonna wait for her to contact us again .
yeah , if she contacts us .
i mean i might have biffed that one permanently .
we don &apos;t know that for sure .
can we just all agree on this to keep us safe ?
yeah , of course .
yeah , absolutely .
第一节课前见
good morning .
is dr. griggs in ? this is veronica hastings .
thank you .
a break @-@ in ?
like with robbers or something ?
no , no , nothing was stolen .
but i got a chance to chat with the sheriff &apos;s office last week .
they said it was most likely a vagrant
looking for shelter or kids looking
for a place to party .
i mean it &apos;s an empty cabin . what do you expect ?
so i have to go up there this weekend .
can you get away ? come with me ?
it &apos;s been a while since we &apos;ve been up there .
my dad &apos;s going up to syracuse and i can &apos;t leave mike .
is there any way your brother could stay with a friend ?
maybe we could drive back and check on him ?
just tell him and my dad that i &apos;m staying at hanna &apos;s or something .
aria , i really need to save the whole weekend .
and i thought we were going to actually
be able to use this cabin .
i &apos;d like to spend some time alone with you .
okay , you know what ,
i &apos;ll figure something out with mike .
when do you want to leave ?
okay , this is the last of it . where do you want it ?
i want what &apos;s in them .
i checked . everything that we seized
from your house has been accounted for .
i &apos;ve missed you .
wow . i helped an old lady find her missing cat once .
i don &apos;t think she was half as happy .
i finally feel like i have feet again .
so how did those books work out for you ?
you finish the one about the teeth ?
you know , they kind of creeped me out .
i mean , i feel like i have to floss like crazy
so i don &apos;t have to go to the dentist anytime soon .
i &apos;m sorry to hear that .
well , if you &apos;re looking for another--
actually , i &apos;m giving up on mysteries for a while .
you know , i was gonna sell them back to the store used ,
but you can have all of them if you want .
no , no , i &apos;m up to my holster in all things
cece drake these days .
funny thing about fugitives ,
they generate a lot of paperwork .
can &apos;t skip to the end , can you ?
i wish .
interviews , official reports , even a false sighting ,
it &apos;s all worth going through with a fine @-@ tooth comb .
you get details about habits and routines ,
personality traits .
&quot; it &apos;s the little things
that are infinitely the most important . &quot;
sir arthur conan doyle said that .
was it her on the phone last night ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
how is she ? is she okay ?
if she wanted to give you an update ,
she &apos;d reach out to you .
oh , wait , she did and you screwed it up .
hey , can we not do snide , shana ?
i want us to help each other help alison .
how ? start a &quot; friends of ali &quot; club ?
make collages and write fan fiction ?
i &apos;m going to be late .
next time you talk to her ,
can you tell her that i &apos;m sorry ?
i &apos;ll see what i can do .
so what &apos;s up with spencer ? did you notice her last night ?
all jittery and caffeine bug @-@ eyed ?
that &apos;s pretty much spencer most days .
she &apos;s probably just studying for something .
she was drinking herbal tea .
that girl is strictly espresso .
she &apos;s not studying , she &apos;s investigating .
sounds like you &apos;re investigating .
i &apos;m just observing details .
i was talking to gabe and--
who ?
holbrook . and he was telling--
wait , wait , wait . detective holbrook ?
are you guys , like friends now ?
friends ? no .
okay , i didn &apos;t even know that he had a first name
and now you &apos;re calling him gabe ?
is he into fashion or something ?
no , aria .
well , i &apos;m just trying to figure out
what you two would be connecting on .
we &apos;re just like book club buddies
without the monthly meetings .
anyway , he just told me something
that i think spencer might be--
hanna , she asked a few questions .
she was trying to figure out who went after emily
that night in school .
she &apos;s not telling us the truth , aria .
can we just spend some time with her this weekend ?
talk some sense into her before she pisses &quot; a &quot; off ?
um , i &apos;m visiting my dad .
he &apos;s lecturing in syracuse
and he wants me to look at the campus , so ...
well , he goes there like every weekend .
can &apos;t you just say next time ?
well , i kind of need a break from mike and mona too .
they &apos;re just a constant barrage of slow jams
and lip balm .
i &apos;m sorry , hanna , i really wish i could , but--
don &apos;t worry about it . i &apos;ll figure it out .
i &apos;m so sorry .
bye , guys .
hey , brenda , can i grab you for a second ?
so my dad &apos;s away on business and the prescription
is in his briefcase .
you &apos;re still taking them , right ?
indeed i am .
just two , are you sure ?
you know what , i should probably make it five .
just in case he forgets on monday and then ,
you know , i have got a couple of these tests coming up , so ...
it &apos;s 50 .
i mean , i was just kind of hoping you could spare them .
don &apos;t haggle , spencer .
it &apos;s tacky .
fifty for first @-@ timers ,
repeat customers get a discount .
like at the hoagie shop ?
do i get the tenth one free ?
fifty ?
okay , i can do that .
here .
come see me next week if you need more .
you know , in case your dad forgets .
hey , spencer .
you got a minute ?
i just finished reading your essay
on shirley jackson &apos;s short story .
is something wrong with it ?
it &apos;s sub @-@ par . it &apos;s unusual for you .
in fact , you &apos;ve practically lifted
an entire paragraph from wikipedia .
how bad is the grade ?
it &apos;s not about the grade .
i &apos;m just wondering what &apos;s been keeping you so busy lately .
i &apos;ve just really been swamped .
what , you thought you &apos;d take a shortcut ?
and more importantly ,
you thought i wouldn &apos;t figure out
what you &apos;ve been up to .
i &apos;d like to see you after school .
no normally i wouldn &apos;t make this exception ,
but i think in your case--
i &apos;ll take the grade .
you sure ?
yeah .
you know , spencer , sloppy work leads to consequences .
i &apos;d hate to see you suffer .
aria .
oh , sorry . you were just on your way out .
just about to get a refill .
it can wait . what &apos;s going on ?
you were right .
i might be a little bit angry but it &apos;s not at my brother .
i think the truth is i &apos;m just angry at myself .
is it okay if we talk ?
hey , spence , me and emily are outside your house .
open up .
hey , hanna , i &apos;m at the library .
no , you &apos;re not .
i can see your car in the driveway .
i walked .
um , look , so the police gave me back my shoes finally
and i was wondering
if you could come over and help me
make my closet all neat @-@ freaky .
i would really like to ,
but fitz is making me redo this essay , so ...
well , come over later ?
yeah , maybe . i really got to go .
mike &apos;s experiences with mona , they are different than mine .
so i have to respect that , i guess .
i guess i &apos;m just confused .
when you came in here , you said you were angry with yourself .
did you want to get into that , or ... ?
yeah , yeah , it &apos;s ...
i mean , i just don &apos;t even really know
who i can talk to anymore .
i &apos;m lying to my boyfriend .
i &apos;m lying to my friends about my boyfriend .
sounds lonely .
you want to start with the boyfriend ?
well , this guy and i ,
we &apos;ve had a really long history .
so my friends just might not be very supportive
if they knew that we were back together .
and why do you feel your friends would disapprove ?
you know what , my brother doesn &apos;t have practice today .
i just realized that .
i &apos;m sitting here talking to you .
okay , well , i &apos;m glad you stopped by , aria .
yeah , thank you .
well , he &apos;s probably waiting , so ...
this feels like a stakeout .
well , there are no coffee or donuts .
ergo , no stakeout .
it &apos;s not the menu , hanna .
it &apos;s the fact that we &apos;re parked outside
spencer &apos;s house trying to figure out
what she &apos;s doing and why she just lied to you .
what if she really is at the library ?
well , did she take her grandfather clock ?
i could hear it clanging through the phone .
is that shana ?
what is she doing at the dilaurentis &apos;s house ?
get down .
okay , this right here , this feels like a stakeout .
this doesn &apos;t make sense .
last night at the brew ,
i &apos;m pretty sure shana was talking to ali .
and the next day , she gets in touch with alison &apos;s mom ?
does mrs. dilaurentis know everything ?
does she know who &apos;s bones are in ali &apos;s grave
or was shana over there telling her ?
or they were they talking about peaches and parasols
and scarlet o &apos;hara .
you said they knew each other from georgia .
i know i said we should trust shana ,
but i think we should follow her .
no . we are not following anybody . &quot; a &quot; said that--
but it &apos;s okay if it &apos;s one of us ?
should we stop by aria &apos;s next and dig through her trash ?
maybe you were right , hanna .
what if shana really is manipulating all of us ?
i don &apos;t give a flying crap about shana .
i care about you .
so if you think this has anything
even remotely to do with alison ,
just please leave it alone .
let &apos;s get out of here .
斯宾塞 · 海斯汀
and this is not the teacher &apos;s lounge .
man , i keep doing that .
two doors down to the right .
jesse lindahl ?
student counseling office . we haven &apos;t met yet .
i &apos;m ezra , english department .
fitz .
i &apos;m still making the rounds , putting all the names to faces .
i hope i didn &apos;t interrupt you .
no , no , i was just pulling a file .
i &apos;m having an academic issue with one of my seniors .
just hoping to get some background .
well , if you want to get to the bottom of it ,
you &apos;ve got to get them talking , you know .
do they talk ?
yeah . you &apos;d be surprised how much students
are willing to reveal about what &apos;s going on in their lives ,
especially when they feel like
they have no one else to talk to .
right .
it was great meeting you , jesse .
you too . see you around , fitz .
i need your help .
okay .
how can i help you ?
not here . inside .
if you want my help ,
you &apos;re gonna have to answer some questions .
i &apos;m an open book .
so what about paige ?
was that on purpose ?
did you date her to get to me ?
when i met her at swim camp ,
i didn &apos;t know you were the one she was still mooning over .
when i got to town , i put it all together .
you &apos;ve always acted like you want to come between us .
i saw a button and i pushed .
it let me know what i needed to know .
which is ?
you &apos;re loyal , fiercely protective ,
emotional but not a fool .
just like alison said .
great .
so you were spying on us too ?
for alison ?
not spying , just taking a look around ,
trying to get to know you .
is that what you were doing in wren &apos;s apartment ?
trying to get to know him ?
he placed an ad .
hired me to ship and pack some boxes in a hurry .
when he found out i go to rosewood high ,
he asked me to be discreet .
be careful with that .
it &apos;s--
it belonged to alison &apos;s grandmother .
ali said it was a gift for someone special .
wouldn &apos;t tell me who .
now i know .
emily , i saw you and hanna today at alison &apos;s house .
i figure you &apos;re probably going to ask about that too ,
so why don &apos;t we just lay it on the table ?
okay .
could you sit ?
you &apos;re making me nervous .
i was trying to get something for alison ,
but i never got a chance .
her mother was so happy to see me ,
i never got a second alone .
does she know ali &apos;s still alive ?
no .
are you sure you didn &apos;t tell her ?
alison doesn &apos;t trust anyone but you .
what were you there to get ?
that &apos;s where you come in .
there &apos;s a poster in alison &apos;s room ,
some french thing with twins .
hi , it &apos;s aria , leave a message
and i &apos;ll call you back .
hey , aria .
i know it &apos;s early , but something &apos;s been going on
and i really have to tell somebody about it .
i really have to tell you about it ,
but if i &apos;m right then ,
then that would just break your heart ,
and if i &apos;m wrong then you &apos;re gonna hate me forever .
and that would really , really break my heart .
so ... if you could just ...
give me a call when you get this message ...
if you &apos;re satisfied with your voice message , please press 1 .
if you &apos;d like to re @-@ record your message ,
press the star key .
hi , it &apos;s aria , leave a message .
coffee smells great .
how long have you been up ?
i didn &apos;t really sleep so well .
you want a cup ?
no .
ezra , i think that you need to take me home .
are you still nervous about being up here ?
no , i &apos;m not nervous .
i &apos;m tired .
you didn &apos;t sleep well last night .
no , i am tired of lying to my family and my friends .
i don &apos;t even know how many different tales i had to spin
just to come up here to be with you this weekend .
look , i know that you have to stay up here ,
but is there a bus station or a train nearby that ... ?
aria , have you ever thought that
maybe this feeling you have of being torn
between me and your friends is maybe not such a bad thing ?
is it supposed to be a good thing ?
maybe .
i know it feels like you &apos;re growing away from them ,
but maybe this feeling is you and me growing closer .
right , but i want to be able
to share that with my closest friends .
and i agree with you .
and i think we &apos;re past the point in our relationship
where we have to hide .
but if what we have is going to last ,
you have to start thinking me
as the person you &apos;re closest to ,
the person that you want to share everything with .
and i have to do that with you .
maybe this was a bad idea .
starting again and bringing you up here .
i &apos;m so sorry i didn &apos;t mean to put any pressure on you , aria .
no , you didn &apos;t .
okay .
why don &apos;t you think about it while i take a shower ?
and if you still want to go , i can drive you .
wait .
no , i want this .
yeah , i really want it to work .
spence .
hanna , i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m just ...
hanna , come on .
i know you were home yesterday .
i heard that stupid clock . why are you ignoring me ?
i &apos;m sorry , okay .
it was wrong of me . i just ..
whatever it is that you &apos;re ...
it &apos;s nothing .
it doesn &apos;t look like nothing .
it looks like you haven &apos;t been sleeping .
i just really have a headache , okay .
and so and we were out of aspirin ...
and you &apos;re lying again .
i just saw you coming down that street , okay .
you did not go to the pharmacy .
i was just in there earlier .
god ! lying !
hanna , would you back off me ?
hey , you two always fight like that ?
no , not really .
i got the impression she was the levelheaded one .
she usually is .
this is the last place i remember seeing it .
it was a stud in a white gold setting .
i &apos;ve dusted in here weekly since you and your mother left .
i haven &apos;t come across a diamond earring .
i borrowed it from my mom without asking .
why don &apos;t i go check the guest bathroom ?
don &apos;t worry , dear , we &apos;ll find it .
thanks .
i found it .
oh , thank goodness .
now your mother will never have to know it was gone .
oh , you &apos;re back .
i didn &apos;t think you &apos;d be gone so long .
yeah , i just took a walk around the cabin ,
took a couple of pictures .
mmm , what smells so good ?
a vegetable tagine minus the actual tagine .
and there &apos;s no lamb in it .
i &apos;m actually using chickpeas .
oh , a night in tunisia .
so exotic .
dammit , i forgot the chickpeas .
oh , i can run down to seymour &apos;s .
are you okay ?
i mean , it &apos;s like an hour there and back .
yeah , yeah .
i actually wanted to take some pictures
of that covered bridge on the way .
keys ?
by the door .
bye , babe .

i can &apos;t come to you , okay ?
i &apos;m at work .
what time does your meet start ?
half an hour .
do you have it ?
it &apos;s money , shana ,
a lot , and a piece of paper .
you weren &apos;t supposed to look .
well , i did .
where does it lead ?
look , we don &apos;t have time for this .
do you have a locker , some place it will be safe ?
no , i mean we keep our stuff under the counter .
don &apos;t just leave it sitting around for someone to steal .
where am i supposed to hide five grand ?
i &apos;m gonna come by after my meet .
excuse me ?
refill ?
hey , mrs. hastings , is spencer home ?
she &apos;s just not answering her cell .
did she say where she went ?
no , no , no ,
she just borrowed some nail polish
and i need it back .
could i stop by ?
great .
thank you .
thanks , mrs. h.
i &apos;ll just be a minute .
ezra in ravenswood ?
where are you going with this , spencer ?
抱歉不能帮你 前任租客的信息是保密的
hello .
hi . i have a flower delivery .
spencer , you shouldn &apos;t be here .
look , i don &apos;t want to fight .
are you on drugs ?
what ? no , i &apos;m not .
you &apos;ve got to be on crack if you think ezra is &quot; a. &quot;
i went through your computer .
you should really use a password
if you want to keep things private ,
especially when you &apos;re following some crazy theory .
look , one of alison &apos;s stories kept on sticking in my brain
and i finally figured it out
and i went to &quot; the hart and huntsman &quot;
and ezra was there and he was eating the pie .
okay . you &apos;re not making sense .
the pie and the beer , hanna , from the story , okay .
it &apos;s called &quot; board shorts ale . &quot;
and that &apos;s exactly what fitz ordered when he was there .
and don &apos;t you get it ?
that &apos;s where alison must have got the nickname .
everything &apos;s all jumbled up in ali &apos;s stories .
what if you &apos;re connecting the wrong dots ?
well , come inside .
either i prove it or i &apos;m wrong .
are you coming ?
新信息 附件
if ezra comes home and finds us here--
i &apos;ve been watching the place all day .
he hasn &apos;t been in or out .
i think he must be out of town .
what are we even looking for ?
primarily , a key . move .
i think ezra may have rented that apartment in ravenswood .
if i can find something that puts him there ,
i &apos;ll have proof .
you &apos;re really serious about this , aren &apos;t you ?
wait , let &apos;s just say that you &apos;re right .
if there &apos;s anything that ties him to ravenswood ,
he &apos;s not keeping it here .
walk away , spencer .
you know , you &apos;re probably right .
that was easy .
i think we &apos;re being watched .
don &apos;t look .
just follow my lead .
yeah , i have not been sleeping well lately .
with all this stuff about ezra in my head ,
i don &apos;t even know what i was thinking .
ezra ?
ezra ?
sorry . i didn &apos;t mean to scare you .
where were you when i woke up ?
i forgot to lock the back door .
were you up late reading ?
yeah , yeah , for a little bit .
what &apos;s wrong ? why couldn &apos;t you sleep ?
are you worried about us ?
i know that i was in a strange place earlier .
and you were right about this not working
unless we tell the truth .
hey , are you okay ?
yeah .
i &apos;m just really glad you stayed .
me too .
wait . he has a surveillance camera ?
what if the building manager put it there ?
it was hidden .
and most honest people put up a sign saying you &apos;re being recorded .
who else do we know who likes to hide cameras
and spy on people ?
but mr. fitz ?
mr. fitz isn &apos;t ...
you &apos;re saying that you think he &apos;s &quot; a &quot; ?
i know . my head feels like it &apos;s full of hot ice cubes .
i mean , he was so sweet to me when my mom was in jail .
he helped me with my college essays .
he was probably trying to get close
so we &apos;d let our guard down .
have you called aria ? we have to call aria .
no , not yet .
i don &apos;t think we should tell her
until we &apos;re 100 % sure .
well , she &apos;s in syracuse with her dad .
so she &apos;s safe for now .
oh , thank god you brought coffee .
here , do you want me to make some ?
yes , but not with that .
that &apos;s for shana .
what does shana want with a bag of beans ?
and why are you still talking to her ?
she needed me to help her with this .
shana give you this ?
no . it belongs to alison .
shana was supposed to meet me at the brew ,
but she never showed up .
there &apos;s contact information there ,
maybe for other people who are helping her
or places to stay .
all i know is that alison &apos;s running out of money
and shana &apos;s the only one who knows how to reach her .
if she can &apos;t deliver it --
ali can &apos;t keep on the move .
and she &apos;s vulnerable .
when was the last time you talked with shana ?
this afternoon . why ?
you said that ezra never came home today .
do you think he &apos;s got her ?
i think maybe he wants shana to lead him to alison
so he can finish what he started .
alison ?
shana , do you have it ?
i was ...
i &apos;m ...
shana , do you have it ?
do you have the money ?
shana ?
i don &apos;t ... i &apos;m not sure where i am .
不要
shana ?
i have to hang up now .
what do you mean ?
i &apos;m sorry i have to go .
shana , what happened to the money ?
i don &apos;t have it .
what am i supposed to do ?
i have to go .
maybe you did it , maybe you didn &apos;t .
sam says you didn &apos;t kill her , and i &apos;ve known sam a long time .
i &apos;ve got a lot of faith in sam . that &apos;s why i took this job .
if i had thought you were a professional killer ,
i wouldn &apos;t have any part of it .
