no .
no tube .
he doesn &apos;t seem to want a tube .
respectfully , dr. bailey ...
make sure to replete his electrolytes ,
and he &apos;ll start recovering .
we &apos;ve already given him--

where the hell is shane ? he was supposed to study with us .
mm , more practice for us .
jo , hit me .
dude , pants !

i &apos;m waiting for alex to make a move ,
so i &apos;m prepared all the time .
what about grooming ?
all the time .
that &apos;s exhausting .
why don &apos;t you just make the first move ?
&apos;cause i &apos;m not the slut who just jumps into bed with someone
right after her friend died .
really ?
well , i &apos;m not gonna advertise it .
trauma in the pit . gotta go .
it &apos;s been a week , and he hasn &apos;t made a move . is that weird ?
yeah .
haircut .
yes .
you can &apos;t just say &quot; haircut . &quot;
you have to say &quot; nice haircut . &quot;
otherwise , i &apos;ll think that you think it &apos;s a bad haircut .
and i &apos;m wearing a dress and i got a haircut
&apos;cause i wanna look nice today . do i look nice ?
you look tense .
say i look nice !
you look nice .
was that so hard ?
mm .
here we are .
oh , my god .
why are we here ?
so you can see it for yourself
so this is not just a concept .
there is a hole in this hospital ,
and it is leaking money .
but isn &apos;t that what insurance is for ?
they are swamped with storm claims .
now with this outpatient surgery wing gone ,
all of those patients are now overloading our regular o.r.s.
well , what do you want us to do about it ?
meet . make a plan . be the board .
we &apos;re all swamped .
and meredith and derek are on leave . webber &apos;s down .
yeah , and you and torres can &apos;t be in the same room .
i have -- i have a patient .
you know , right now
this hospital needs doctors more than it needs board members .
what this hospital needs is both .
if you people can &apos;t be both , then we are in a lot of trouble .
i should go .
why ?
we can &apos;t be alone together .
we &apos;re just ... talking about work .
nurses &apos; station . can i help you ?
you all right ?
yeah .
no . i -- no .
i haven &apos;t heard yet .
about my boards .
but don &apos;t freak out . you passed .
well , if i didn &apos;t ,
you &apos;ll know that the first time wasn &apos;t your fault .
it was all me .
don &apos;t freak out .
hey . you &apos;re riding with me today .
yeah , about that -- - come on , it &apos;s a good one .
coming through !
oh , what do we got ?
human pincushion .
kathleen kane , 38 .
woman versus shattered baseball bat .
puncture wounds to the chest
and what looks like a distal radius fracture .
b.p. 85 palp , pressure 135 .
the batter was jammed with a fastball ,
and -- and the bat , it just exploded , you know ?
my jersey &apos;s really messed up .
don &apos;t worry about that , baby .
okay , everybody . ready ? on my count .
one , two , three .
i &apos;m here . i &apos;m right here , okay ?
somebody paged me ?
possible colles &apos; fracture .
uh , sir , i need you to wait outside .
all right ? right now , she needs you to give us room to work .
we need another nurse in here !
you &apos;re gonna make sure she &apos;s all right , right ? kat ?
all right , i &apos;m gonna -- i &apos;m gonna
show you where you can wait . okay ?
decreased breath sounds on the right .
we need x @-@ ray in here stat !
right away .
i &apos;m dizzy . it &apos;s dark .
am i dying ?
no , ma &apos;am .
her systolic &apos;s down to 78 .
tell dante .
you have to tell dante . look at me .
if i die ...
you &apos;re not dying .
you need to tell my husband . promise me .
uh , of course .
he needs to know .
and tell him ...
i will . what is it ?
i cheated on him with his brother .
what ? !
what did she say ?
did you hear what she asked me ?
people say crazy things when they &apos;re in shock .
c.t. ready for us ?
hey , kepner , did you hear back yet , by the way ?
no , not yet .
you think that &apos;s bad ?
you think it &apos;s good ?
so do i have to tell her husband ?
tell him what ?
she grabbed me with her bloody claw
and said if she dies to tell him that she slept with his brother .
bitch .
why would she ask me to do that ?
maybe she wants a clear conscience .
maybe he cheated first and trashed the marriage .
maybe he &apos;s an inconsiderate cheating bastard ,
and she wanted to get the last word .
so ... i don &apos;t have to tell him , right ?
how about you just don &apos;t let her die ?
okay , we can &apos;t wait for c.t. we gotta get her into the o.r.
we &apos;ll put the chest tube in there .
uh , sorry .
uh , just confirming i &apos;ll see you tonight at 7 : 00 ?
yeah , i don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea .
callie , we agreed to couples therapy .
yeah , we agreed to a lot of things . so ...
okay , well , i &apos;ll be there .
murphy , make yourself useful and put a splint on that arm .
he needs an n.g. tube , dr. grey .
i was hoping you could call dr bailey and --
dr. bailey is gonna kill me if i call her again .
richard is just being stubborn ,
and bailey doesn &apos;t want to call him out .
order the n.g. tube ,
and that way , at least it will be ready
by the time bailey comes to her senses .
but i &apos;m not sure that she -- - i have to go .
an hour and a half to go get milk ?
i think , um ...
i might &apos;ve closed my eyes in the store parking lot .
i really should be studying .
trust me . you are gonna want to be in on this .
this is the best part of the job .
cara .
carlos .
guys , this is dr. edwards .
she &apos;ll be assisting today .
and i ... have the simulation back .
mm . show me . show me .
okay , now first , we &apos;re gonna be removing the scars
using tissue harvested from your back and scalp .
and then i &apos;m gonna hide our new scars
right here in the facial planes .
and it &apos;s gonna look a little something like this ...
oh , my god .
really ?
you can do that ?
you can make me look like that ?
now it &apos;s a estimate , but it is very , very close .
and it &apos;s free ?
&apos;cause our insurance maxed out about two surgeries ago .
we know . that &apos;s why this one &apos;s on us .
hey , cara .
i didn &apos;t think i was gonna get to go back to work .
she teaches kindergarten .
yeah , she &apos;s afraid she &apos;s gonna scare the kids .
and she can &apos;t teach without feeling her best , right ?
you guys !
thank you ... so much .
you still want to study ?
she has lost a lot of blood , but she &apos;s stable for now .
we &apos;re gonna take her into surgery and remove the fragments .
okay . okay , thanks .
marcus , she &apos;s-- she &apos;s going into surgery , man .
is she gonna be all right ?
no , it &apos;s okay . he &apos;s family . he &apos;s my brother .
she &apos;s ...
i &apos;m ...
gonna ...
see you after .
thanks , man .
uh , in the 17 years since your infant heart transplant ,
your mitral valve has started to fail .
so replacing it would increase cardiac function .
and he won &apos;t need another transplant .
that is the hope .
i gotta ask you again .
are you sure that you wanna do this ?
there &apos;s a high risk of tearing a ventricle ,
uh , bleeding , arrhythmias--
you &apos;re saying he &apos;d need a transplant anyway .
i &apos;m saying that he could die .
the safest bet is to put michael on the list for a new heart .
no .
i understand the risks . we talked about it .
we almost lost him waiting for his last heart .
when it was clear he was dying ,
i asked the nurse if i could hold him .
he was so tiny .
i spent a whole night
looking in his eyes , telling him i loved him ,
accepting that i would never , ever hear his first word .
i held my baby while he died .
and then the phone rang .
but i almost lost him .
and i cannot go through that again .
the chance that there will be another donor that matches me ,
that i &apos;ll live long enough for us to find that person ,
that i &apos;ll even get to the top of the list ...
we like these odds better .
okay .
well , if your mri is good ,
we &apos;ll get started today .
that kid should be on the u.n.o.s. list .
well , you heard them , alex .
they wanna take a shot .
and who are you to say no to a high @-@ risk surgery ?
let &apos;s just see what his mri says .
funny thing .
i didn &apos;t order an n.g.tube.
did you hear me order an n.g. tube , dr. webber ?
no .
i--
so you can imagine our surprise
when a nurse brought one in ,
along with a feeding pump .
dr. webber worried that i had changed his course of treatment
without consulting him .
dr. bailey--
i told him i did not .
so then we got to thinking about who , perhaps ,
could have ordered these things ,
and your name came up .
i was trying to be proactive .
in case repleting his electrolytes doesn &apos;t work--
you wanna be proactive ?
get me some soup .
you heard the man .
hey , what do you mean &quot; no pro bono surgeries &quot; ?
all--all funds are being reallocated to storm repair
until further notice .
what ? who said that ?
the board did , so ... you .
all right , well , my lady &apos;s facial reconstruction surgery
was booked way before the storm .
she teaches kindergarten .
avery , i don &apos;t make the rules .
i just get to be the bad cop here .
so then i &apos;ll just have the board meet ,
and they &apos;re gonna approve it .
well , that &apos;s gonna be tricky since everyone on the board
has their own pro bonos that they wanna do .
so when you all get together , maybe come find me
and tell me how you plan to fund repairing the outpatient o.r.
so we &apos;re not drowning in patients .
come on . we &apos;re gonna get to that when things slow down .
things won &apos;t slow down until we get to it .
well , if you &apos;d let me finish my reconstruction surgery--
avery , we do not have the money for this surgery .
listen to me . all due respect , you said it yourself--
you don &apos;t make the rules . i do .
now cara mcadams--that pro bono is not gonna be canceled .
i need you to be a good cop , a traffic cop .
uh , i &apos;m sorry ?
move some patients around .
if we &apos;re overloaded ,
then transfer them to seattle pres .
i don &apos;t care . but make some room .
yes , sir .
so i &apos;m waiting on the kid &apos;s mri ,
and if it &apos;s too crappy ,
i have to put him on the transplant list
and no surgery . so what do you think ?
i think he went to the store
and took a nap in the parking lot .
where &apos;s my nap , cristina ?
i don &apos;know . i didn &apos;t steal your nap .
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s just my boobs hurt and they &apos;re covered in lanolin
and i smell like an old couch .
okay . got eyes on webber .
no n.g. tube .
damn it , shane .
i almost touched his arm today .
webber &apos;s ?
no . owen &apos;s .
he &apos;s so stressed out about the hospital ,
and i thought , you know ,
i &apos;d offer some support and touch his arm .
but ... you know , you touch his arm
and then you &apos;re in bed ,
and then ...
nothing &apos;s changed .
oh , crap . hold on .
i got my valve kid &apos;s mri .
mer ?
mer ?
oh , big help .
the shower works better when you &apos;re in it .
he &apos;s hungry , and my nipples are no use to him .
i know .
did you see the look on her face
when you showed her that picture ?
i just--i wanna see that look on her new face .
i &apos;m glad chief hunt came around .
i made sure he got the message that i am doing the surgery
whether he likes it or not .
where is mrs. mcadams ?
she was moved out by chief hunt .
i don &apos;t think he got the message .
owen ?
why do you keep rescheduling my surgeries ?
well , let &apos;s have a board meeting , and i &apos;ll tell you .
why can &apos;t you tell me right now ?
because i &apos;m busy rescheduling surgeries .
why ? !
owen ?
what &apos;s this about a purchasing freeze on the nicu budget ?
good . i have two of you here . at least maybe we could ...
oh . okay .
we &apos;re not buying the babies jewelry .
we &apos;re buying them medicine .
right now , we &apos;re low on nicu blankets .
that &apos;s baby blankets .
don &apos;t tell me . tell the board !
hunt , where did my pro bono go ?
well , i took your advice about transfers ...
so i found someone at seattle pres who could do it .
that is my patient .
not anymore . your patient is , uh ...
let &apos;s see ... a gluteal liposuction ?
with two lipos after that .
you can &apos;t just fill my day with--
of course i can .
it &apos;s what a traffic cop does .
gluteal lipo . so that &apos;s--
sucking butt fat .
is that part of the logo ?
it &apos;s gotta be the source of all this blood .
nope . there &apos;s blood coming from somewhere else ,
superiorly .
we &apos;re gonna have to extend this incision . scalpel ?
scalpel .
so i don &apos;t have to tell dante , right ?
i mean , i can just forget that she said it ?
murphy--
&apos;cause the brother &apos;s here now ,
and it &apos;ll just ignite a family feud .
and maybe i heard her wrong .
what else sounds like &quot; brother &quot; ?
&quot; mother &quot; ?
oh , god .
she &apos;s gonna live , okay ?
no . i know .
it &apos;s just , there &apos;s a big bleeder that we haven &apos;t found yet .
murphy !
are you gonna watch me eat ?
no . absolutely not .
what are you doin &apos; ?
scavenging . nicu &apos;s low on blankets .
what are you doin &apos; ?
i have a painful erection that won &apos;t subside .
oh . not .... not me .
uh , cards .
my condition is priapism .
major causes are sickle cell .
and ...
crap .
leukemia .
i hope it goes away soon .
uh , you know ,
you can kick my friends out if you want to .
i mean , it &apos;s your house .
they shouldn &apos;t be there all the time .
no . hey , uh ...
your--your friend died a week ago .
you guys should hang out or whatever .
unless you &apos;re over it already .
no . i mean , i &apos;m--i &apos;m still really sad . of course .
but , uh ... um ...
look , i get it .
i ...
i mean , they can crash however long they want .
you &apos;re being really great about this .
really , really great .
your mitral valve replacement ?
a 17 @-@ year @-@ old infant heart transplant recipient .
karev doesn &apos;t think i should do it .
his e.f. &apos; s only 25 % .
yeah , it sucks .
and there is a lot of scarring to get through .
karev is right .
this kid should go straight on the transplant list .
it &apos;s risky ,
but the parents want it , and so does the kid .
sound like you &apos;re gonna go ahead then .
well , good luck .
thanks .
what ?
normally , i &apos;d kiss you .
i &apos;d wish you luck and then i &apos;d kiss you .
hey , you guys did couples therapy , right ?
was it good ? did it help ?
i mean , obviously not , right ? look at you guys .
uh , no offense .
offense .
well ...
torres .
what ? !
the only way ? no , no , no . no , you don &apos;t cut the clavicle !
no , don &apos;t do that without me !
why would you do that ? !
because the
subclavian &apos;s bleeding like stink ,
and we can &apos;t get to it .
she &apos;s bleeding out !
and she &apos;s bleeding out .
okay , everybody out .
what ?
everybody out . get out . get out now ! now !
why ? what ?
come on , get out ! come on !
get out ! come on !
you do not cut a clavicle yourselves !
no ! no !
she says &quot; no . &quot;
i don &apos;t think i have a choice .
she doesn &apos;t have--
i can hear her ! tell her i &apos;m on my way !
she &apos;s on her way .
excuse me !
what do we do ?
b.p. &apos; s dropping .
give me the saw .
here you go .
oh , god .
what the hell did you just do ? !
what part of &quot; don &apos;t cut the clavicle &quot;
do you not understand ?
i fixed it .
massive bleeder just under the right--
you made a clean cut down the middle .
do you have any idea how difficult it is
to repair bone with this little surface area ?
there was no way to do the repair without visibility .
mm , no , there was no easy way .
and because you &apos;re careless and thoughtless ,
that seemed prohibitive to you .
you think you can just do whatever you feel like in the moment ,
and ortho will just put everything back the way
it &apos;s supposed to be .
she was dying !
no , just go . let me clean up your mess .
come on .
promise me if it looks too gnarly
you &apos;ll just close him up .
will you stop wringing your hands ?
god . no wonder you can &apos;t have sex .
i can have sex .
i can have sex .
are the hydraulics not working ? i can write you a script .
look , that &apos;s not ... she &apos;s just ...
bummed about her dead friend
and stressed about her exams .
ugh . those are not valid .
all right . there &apos;s been a lot of girls since izzie .
a lot of nobodies .
but this girl is not a nobody .
she &apos;s ... i don &apos;t know . when i think about it ,
it just seems important . like ...
like it &apos;s gotta be the right time .
you want it to be special .
what ?
nothing . it &apos;s sweet .
are you making fun of me ?
i am not .
can i ask you one thing ? when we &apos;re done here ,
will you braid my hair ?
oh , boy .
mm . last chance to turn back .
scissors .
here you go .
of course i pissed him off .
but transferring my patient to some other hospital
just to spite me ?
seems extreme .
yeah , he can &apos;t do it .
yeah , he can . he &apos;s your boss .
no . i &apos;m his boss . right ?
the board is his boss .
that &apos;s a jacked up system .
the system is actually fine .
it &apos;s just in this particular situation , it becomes--
jacked up ?
complicated .
you know what &apos;s not complicated ? this .
unless i &apos;m missing something ,
you just suck the fat with that hose .
well , pretty--pretty much .
okay . and the next lipo will be just like this ?
oh , it &apos;s gonna be a different butt entirely .
do you really need me here ?
&apos;cause everyone else is studying .
you said something about being with me all day .
thought we were changing lives ?
yeah , but i also wanted to see the look on our patient &apos;s face .
get out of here .
thanks !
is he asleep ?
no . he hates sleep .
he &apos;s staring at the mobile .
i don &apos;t know how such a little kid ...
can puke on so many things .
i don &apos;t know .
are you asleep ?
no .
nobody &apos;s asleep . are you asleep ?
no , i &apos;m too worried about richard to sleep .
he needs an n.g. tube ,
and of course he doesn &apos;t want one .
and he &apos;s intimidating bailey into not ordering one .
but that &apos;s what he needs .
he made me his family , and then i abandoned him .
it &apos;s just a mess over there .
swallow study ?
okay , ross , i can &apos;t read this . take this .
ross .
i know .
he &apos;s got a p.a.s. score of 6 ?
i know .
okay , i &apos;m a 60 @-@ year @-@ old woman
with abdominal pain , a fever , and significant discharge .
my initial diagnosis is that you &apos;re gross .
you guys have gotta go .
no study hall at alex &apos;s tonight .
but it &apos;s our spot . we &apos;re study buddies .
no , you are a freaking human chastity belt .
i know we &apos;ve been grieving , but it &apos;s been a week .
i am all grieved out .
ooh . celibacy &apos;s made you mean .
heather would understand . she &apos;d want me to get laid .
pushing it , but okay .
okay , look , this is my last pair of clean , sexy underwear .
then it &apos;s all granny panties until laundry day .
it has to be tonight .
oh , no , no , no , no , no , no !
what happened ? !
i think she stroked out .
push high dose epi .
i already pushed high dose epi .
did you try vasopressin ?
kepner , she &apos;s been down for 15 minutes .
what ?
no .
time of death--1617 .
oh , dear god .
i &apos;m sorry . i tried .
so , um ...
what do i tell the husband ?
you tell him ...
we did everything we could ,
but despite our best efforts , we---
not that part .
the part about how she slept with his brother .
he &apos;s about to hear that his wife is dead . i think that &apos;s enough .
hang on .
the woman trusted you , murphy .
she wanted him to know the truth .
it &apos;s his last memory of his wife .
yeah , well , at least it &apos;ll be an honest one .
he deserves to know .
and you made a promise .
you &apos;re gonna tell him , and i &apos;m gonna make sure you do .
what were you thinking ?
hey , what in god &apos;s name ?
ross showed me richard &apos;s chart .
but you have staples in your body !
i took them out . i &apos;m a skilled surgeon .
you have no pain ?
i have a lot of pain . it &apos;s called sleep deprivation .
richard is starving .
we have a plan .
&quot; we &quot; have a plan ?
yeah .
he &apos;s a patient here . he doesn &apos;t get to make decisions .
no . we do . we who are here . we who have the plan .
so why don &apos;t you go back home--
i will once i know he &apos;s okay .
he &apos;s not okay . and it isn &apos;t as simple
as sticking a feeding tube down his throat .
it is that simple .
we all know he can &apos;t get well unless he eats ,
and he can &apos;t eat if he can &apos;t swallow .
you know as well as i do
that a feeding tube is psychologically devastating .
it takes away a man &apos;s dignity--
so does dying .
i really wanna talk to the radiologist
about the swallow study .
well , fine . let &apos;s go .
okay .
what &apos;s in your hair ?
baby vomit .
give me the damn stroller .
what the hell do you think you &apos;re doing ?
you have dysphagia and laryngeal edema .
even if you could eat on your own , which you can &apos;t ,
you &apos;re at risk for aspirating your food .
you need an n.g. tube , or you &apos;re gonna starve .
and i &apos;m not gonna let another one of us die .
you &apos;re an intern .
don &apos;t talk to me like i don &apos;t know what &apos;s happening .
you &apos;re pretending like it isn &apos;t happening ,
and dr. bailey &apos;s letting you .
dr. grey is here .
she came all this way with a baby ,
and there &apos;s no way she &apos;s gonna leave
without forcing this thing through your nose
and into your stomach .
and i think you don &apos;t want her to be the one to do that .
i &apos;m offering to take care of this right now .
just you and me .
avery , i have one more patient for you .
no , no , no . no more .
and i &apos;m calling cara mcadams first thing
and i &apos;m doing the pro bono surgery ,
and the board is gonna discuss your behavior .
avery , avery , look .
she &apos;s all set for you first thing tomorrow .
you said you transferred her .
i lied .
you lied ?
yeah , i @-@ i just moved her .
so that means you decided that three liposuctions
were more important than this lady &apos;s facial re--
no , but the three lipos
will pay for this lady &apos;s facial reconstruction .
the money has to come from somewhere .
so , yeah , i lied , and now you have the money .
i ...
avery , i needed to make a point with you .
i know we &apos;re all doctors , and we &apos;re all busy ,
but until the board members are willing to solve
the bigger budget problems caused by the storm ,
the doctors &apos; problems aren &apos;t going away .
so you need to do something now .
you are right .
yeah . you all need to meet .
i can &apos;t force you to--
no , no . you can .
you &apos;re our boss , and you can lie .
he &apos;s in v @-@ tach , yang . you should stop .
they &apos;ve all been short runs
and then they &apos;ve all stopped . it &apos;s fine .
you gotta get over this &quot; special &quot; thing .
just throw her over your shoulder ,
take her to bed , and go to town .
every girl &apos;s dream .
she &apos;s the thing that &apos;s special , dumbass .
god , you have the right person right there .
you both want the same thing .
wait . d @-@ don &apos;t--don &apos;t-- don &apos;t go too deep .
stop being scared .
this family is not scared . this boy is not scared .
i am not doing this because i want to .
i &apos;m doing this because they asked me to and because i can .
what are you waiting for ?
the arrhythmias are coming closer .
if i keep pushing , i &apos;ll send him into v @-@ fib .
even cannulating will destroy the heart
before i get to the valve .
you win . this kid needs a new heart .
let &apos;s get out of here .
i &apos;m sorry .
so am i.
you okay ?
just lost a patient ,
and now i am waiting for more bad news .
still haven &apos;t heard ?
you know , when i failed last year ,
i found out before i got home that night .
it &apos;s been 48 hours , and nothing .
i think if you fail twice ,
they just stop talking to you and hope you get the hint .
i &apos;m pretty sure that &apos;s not how it works .
it &apos;s them . it &apos;s here .
good .
me ? i &apos;m--no . i don &apos;t--
please ? i can &apos;t .
what ?
just ...
congratulations .
yes !
yes . yes ! yes !
thank you , god ! thank you !
that &apos;s ... yes !
like you said ...
it &apos;s all you .
congratulations .
thank you .
yeah .
your wife had a stroke during surgery .
she had a coagulation disorder ,
which is why the clot formed so quickly .
we &apos;re so , so sorry for your loss .
she was just here .
she was laughing on the way here . she wanted me--
she wanted me to find out who won the game .
there is one other thing i need to tell you .
before she went into surgery ,
your wife wanted me to tell you--
that she loves you .
she told us to tell you that she loves you .
thank you .
shepherd ?
oh , have you seen my wife and baby ?
wait . meredith &apos;s here ?
meredith .
crap . i meant to text you .
i woke up to nothing and nobody .
the woman &apos;s wearing mismatched shoes . cut her some slack .
i have to go check on richard .
send me a note next time .
you look like hell .
you know you &apos;re in a building full of beds .
i just need to go lie down .
ross , what did you do ?
you re supposed to wait until--
he was overdue for the tube ,
and nobody seemed to wanna do it .
he was starving to death right in front of us ,
so i did what had to be done .
there was so much scar tissue .
i &apos;m afraid i @-@ i couldn &apos;t get to the valve to repair it .
michael has to go on the transplant list .
the transplant coordinator will be in
to ask you some questions .
oh , god .
look , the transplant list is not a death sentence .
it &apos;s a chance . it--it &apos;s hope that most people never get .
when michael wakes up , he needs to hear that from you .
i know it &apos;s not what you wanted ,
but now we have to move forward .
michael needs the hope
that there is a donor out there somewhere ,
or he won &apos;t survive .
you &apos;re up ?
barely . i got paged .
me , too .
well , who would page us ? we &apos;re not even supposed to be here .
i was having the nicest dream .
wait . you guys got a page ?
god , what happened to the guy ?
apparently everything .
hey , you were paged , too ? why outpatient surgery ?
well , it &apos;s a disaster area . maybe someone got hurt .
i don &apos;t know .
it worked .
i cannot believe that that worked .
uh , okay . where &apos;s the trauma ?
there &apos;s no trauma . this is a meeting of the board .
there &apos;s no trauma ?
a meeting about what ?
we &apos;re gonna have a party .
is this--is this a trauma , a meeting or a party ?
i &apos;m so confused .
i &apos;m so tired .
we &apos;re gonna have a party , folks .
a big one . gala fund @-@ raiser .
we &apos;re gonna invite the richest people that we know ,
and we are gonna charm the money out of them .
but first , dr. hunt is gonna tell us
exactly how much money we need and where it needs to go ,
starting with what used to be this room .
so ... let &apos;s settle in . this is gonna take a while .
we have the house to ourselves .
but i want you to know
that just because i &apos;m about to jump into bed with you
does not mean i &apos;m an unfeeling slut
who isn &apos;t sad about heather ,
because i am sad .
i &apos;m also very , very--
no more talking .
what ?
thank god !
eventually , i &apos;m gonna touch your arm ,
and you are going to kiss me good luck before surgery .
cristina .
let &apos;s ...
date other people .
okay , it &apos;ll--it &apos;ll suck .
and it &apos;ll feel forced , but maybe it &apos;ll help .
maybe eventually i won &apos;t want to take your hand
when we get off the elevator at the end of the day .
no , come on .
don &apos;t .
just tell me you &apos;ll try .
i &apos;ll try .
okay .
thank god . you came .
i &apos;ve been wishing you hadn &apos;t told me ...
and that we could go back to our life ,
to being happy .
except we weren &apos;t ...
happy .
at least you weren &apos;t .
and so we do things like have sex with other people .
callie , i made a mistake .
one mistake--
yeah , i don &apos;t think it was a mistake .
i &apos;ve been picturing you screwing that woman
over and over again . i @-@ i can &apos;t ...
think about it or talk about her anymore .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m all done with that for right now .
so i &apos;m ... not going into that room .
but i think you should .
i think you need to .
in the game of mercy , when one kid cries out ...
no .
the other one listens ,
and the pain stops .
please .
i really need to talk .
i really need you to-- to do this .
i know .
you wore the red dress and everything .
don &apos;t you wish it was that easy now ?
i &apos;m sorry . i know i haven &apos;t been here .
you picked me as your family--
stop it .
stop it .
i didn &apos;t call you my family .
i &apos;m not your father .
i chose you because i thought you could put emotion aside ...
and make the right call .
i knew bailey was too weak .
but you ...
i thought i could trust ...
not to let them operate on me when i was all but ...
when i was all but dead .
not to bring me back to ...
a life ...
where i have to get my ...
meals from a ...
from a tube .
i thought you wouldn &apos;t be sentimental .
i was wrong .
i chose the wrong person .
it &apos;s not a game anymore ,
and we &apos;re not kids .
you can cry &quot; mercy &quot; all you want ,
but nobody &apos;s listening .
it &apos;s just you ...
