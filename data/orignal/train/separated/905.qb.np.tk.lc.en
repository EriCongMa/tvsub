back in the &apos; 80s ,
we all wanted to be a badass fighter pilot
thanks to the cinematic masterpiece that was &quot; top gun , &quot;
and no one loved it more than my big bro .
you &apos;re handsome and clear for takeoff .
yeah , he was a real maverick .
his fighter jet was our beat @-@ up station wagon ,
and his co @-@ pilot -- my annoyed sister .
dear god , you have been flipping knobs for five minutes !
just go already .
we ain &apos;t going anywhere till tower clears us for takeoff .
you &apos;re clear .
but as fate would have it ,
my brother &apos;s high @-@ flying dreams were about to become a reality .
great goose &apos;s ghost .
today , our lives change forever , boys .
behold .
junior rotc .
th &apos;s like pre @-@ pre @-@ military training .
dude , i think they give you free camo when you sign up .
sweet . now i can hide from my mean cousin
when we visit my uncle &apos;s farm .
morning , gentlemen .
interested in joining up with junior rotc ?
i need able @-@ bodied leaders with fire in their bellies
looking to make a difference .
that &apos;s so weird .
i &apos;m an able @-@ bodied person with a fiery belly
who &apos;s ready to fly your jets and push your envelopes
and play shirtless beach volleyball .
what ?
it &apos;s proven to be a nice diversion from the pressures of flight school .
what &apos;s your name , son ?
barry norman goldberg , nickname not yet decided .
you will be amazed by our strength and determination , sir !
i &apos;ve got english on the third floor .
so many stairs .
naked rob , piggyback .
you got it , bro .
never leave a man behind .
it was november 22 , 1980 @-@ something ,
and i was spending the day with my loyal best bud , pops .
your mom was nuts to take away my license .
look at me go !
despite his age , my grandpa was the youngest dude i knew .
winner !
balls !
you want to go hustle some suckers at air hockey ?
i &apos;m old with a wallet full of cash .
how do i play this ice ping @-@ pong ?
after we hustled some kids in air hockey ,
pops set his sights on our next target .
look at this .
free movie tickets .
what do you say we play a couple more chumps ?
mom says to be weary of timeshare people .
they &apos;re the gypsies of the mall .
all we got to do is listen to them jabber for a half @-@ hour
and then see &quot; mad max : thunderdome &quot; on their dime .
sign me up .
howdy , folks .
and welcome .
i &apos;m john calabasas ,
the president and c.e.o. of john calabasas &apos; timeshares .
thank you very much . that &apos;s very kind .
oh , stop . thank you so much .
folks , who would like to live in the condo of their dreams ?
for two months out of the year .
i &apos;m talking about timeshares , y &apos;all .
question .
yes , sir .
if we decide not to buy today ,
do we still get the movie tickets ?
that &apos;s the deal , but i can promise you this , sir --
at the end of today ,
you &apos;re not gonna be thinking about movie tickets .
you &apos;re gonna be thinking about
boca sands resort and tennis club .
i &apos;m intrigued about this exciting opportunity .
movie tickets all locked up .
so began an epic speech
designed to pull in old suckers .
lucky for me , pops was young at heart .
complete with sauna and recently disinfected steam room .
the best overly air @-@ conditioned chain restaurants
that open for dinner at 3 : 00 p.m.
not only is it sunny year @-@ round in our community ,
the women outnumber the gentlemen three to one .
sold !
oh , my god .
pops actually bought a place in florida ? !
right ? it &apos;s a nightmare .
hello ? !
we &apos;re gonna have our own beach condo .
think of all the spring breaks , the latin guys ,
the romantic walks on the beach with the latin guys .
why do i come to you ?
you need to chill . it &apos;s a timeshare .
he &apos;ll be gone two months a year .
everyone knows a timeshare is a gateway property .
two months becomes six .
six become a year .
and a year turns into forever .
so ?
pops is old , and that &apos;s what all old people do .
stop saying that . pops isn &apos;t old .
he &apos;s 80 .
who cares ? i measure age in spirit .
well , i measure age by when you were born .
and for pops , that &apos;s 1903 .
holy crap . seriously ?
oh , yeah .
shut up ! everyone shut up !
i got barry news .
everybody stop talking .
what is it , snuggle monster ?
i joined the military .
what &apos;s that now ?
good stuff . what branch ?
the one with the planes and boats .
you &apos;re welcome , america .
i just need you to sign this permission slip .
absolutely not .
being a soldier is number one
on my list of jobs too dangerous for my children .
list ? what list ?
oh , god . not the list .
i knew one day my kids would join the workforce ,
so like a good mother , i compiled a list of occupations
that are strictly off @-@ limits .
why can &apos;t i be a construction worker ?
eating lunch on a suspended beam with your legs dangling down ?
no way .
no pro sports ?
except golf , but you can &apos;t drive around
in one of those buggies with no seat belt .
astronaut ?
your sensitive tummy at zero g ?
deli guy .
meat slicer .
government clerk .
paper cut .
robot technician .
robot uprising .
this is nuts . pops was in the army .
and he is a hero . couldn &apos;t be prouder of him .
but i want to be a hero .
and you can be ...
as an orthodontist or a maitre d&apos;
or as one of those guys who tests pillows for softness .
yep . all hope was lost .
i &apos;ll sign it .
and then found .
really ?
i did rotc . it changed my life .
and i fully support this as long as your mother never finds out .
and one more thing -- if you do this , there &apos;s no quitting .
i mean it .
10 @-@ 4 , good buddy .
that &apos;s trucker talk .
aye @-@ aye , matey .
that &apos;s pirate .
while barry was committed to the army ,
i was committed to showing pops just how young he was .
there he is , rockin &apos; the new duds .
you dig &apos; em , homey ?
they &apos;re roomy where i need them ,
but kind of drafty where i don &apos;t .
perfect !
let &apos;s go hit the town and live it up while we &apos;re still young .
what the ...
how did your zubaz get so high ?
they ride up . i don &apos;t know .
they have a mind of their own .
now all you can see is &quot; frankie says . &quot;
no one will know to relax .
who is this frankie , and why does he want me to relax ?
all you need to know
is you look half your age in those zubaz pants .
way too young for florida .
oh , so that &apos;s what this is about .
kiddo , it &apos;s just two months .
two months in middle @-@ school years is like a decade .
come on , pal .
pops says relax .
don &apos;t you use that catchphrase against me !
i will not relax !
where you going ?
to my other grandpa , the one who &apos;d never leave me .
pop @-@ pop ?
you really want to replace me with that spiteful old bastard ?
already done . have fun in florida .
i &apos;ll be living it up here with pop @-@ pop
having crazy amounts of fun .
this is fun .
so much fun .
i &apos;m reading the stocks .
yep . this was my grandfather ben .
he was the anti @-@ pops who could never catch a break .
damn ibm ! i should have invested .
i &apos;d be a millionaire .
instead , i lost it all on cigaroos .
what &apos;s that ?
cigarettes for kids . yeah .
they had a spokesbunny .
isn &apos;t that adorable ? it was a slam dunk !
as i was bonding with pop @-@ pop , barry was ready for action .
barry norman goldberg reporting for duty , sir !
son , i told you three times . i know you &apos;re here .
question -- when do we get our nicknames assigned ,
&apos;cause i &apos;m thinking i &apos;m gonna be sky shark .
i call sky tiger .
dude , i told you sky tiger was my nickname .
no one &apos;s sky tiger . i &apos;m sky shark .
there can &apos;t be two skies .
i was kind of thinking thunder shark .
enough !
instead of nicknames , how about this -- give me 20 push @-@ ups .
if my body &apos;s already in peak physical condition ,
can i pass and practice instead ?
practice what ?
volleyball .
you know , for when we go to the beach
and flex our young , glistening bodies .
i &apos;m kind of body @-@ conscious ,
so i &apos;m not gonna pop off my shirt at the beach ,
if that &apos;s cool .
he &apos;s got an outie .
there &apos;s no volleyball .
son , if you &apos;re not here to work , you &apos;re worthless to me .
but i was led to believe i &apos;m special .
you want special treatment ? drop and give me 40 !
how was training , big guy ?
captain wallace says i &apos;m , like , better than rambo , the real one .
they &apos;re friends .
well , i &apos;m just proud that you &apos;re sticking with it .
oh , yeah . stick @-@ to @-@ it barry .
that &apos;s what they call me .
mom !
dad secretly signed a permission slip
to get me in basic training .
now i need to have you secretly get me out of it .
what ? !
dad won &apos;t let me quit ,
but captain wallace is super demanding and angry .
he called me worthless .
are you kidding me ?
i know . right ?
worthless ?
well , obviously , he &apos;s never seen you
ride a tandem bicycle with your mother .
i was doing most of the pedaling .
are you sure he called you worthless ?
maybe he called you wonderful ?
no . you have to get me out of this , ma .
unless you want me to fly secret missions
to dangerous foreign lands .
you can &apos;t go on a secret mission .
they won &apos;t let you call home ,
and they don &apos;t know what kind of cheese binds you up .
so , you &apos;ll help ?
don &apos;t worry , snuggy @-@ boo .
i &apos;ll get you out .
now , drop and give me 20 .
huggies .
and with that , beverly goldberg went to war .
i was still upset about our fight ,
pops was ready to extend an olive branch .
hey , sweetheart . y @-@ you seen adam ?
i @-@ i got him one of those atari @-@ natendo games .
it &apos;s just like the red @-@ car , blue @-@ car game
that we play at the arcade .
aww , that &apos;s so cute . but he &apos;s hanging with pop @-@ pop .
pop @-@ pop ? i thought he was bluffing .
you can always hang with me ,
you know , make the little nerd jealous .
it &apos;d be pretty damn petty of me to use you as some pawn .
oh , i &apos;m totally cool with it .
we can , like , go to the mall .
so , this is all a ploy to get me to buy you stuff ?
see ? we get each other .
i &apos;ll drive .
as erica and pops had formed an alliance ,
my mom was waging war .
you , sir !
we need to talk .
mrs. goldberg , i told you .
yelling hours are between 9 : 00 and 12 : 00 .
this is my lunch break .
eat your tater tots , earl .
i &apos;m here for him .
what &apos;s happening right now ?
this is beverly goldberg .
she &apos;s the delta force of mothers .
and i &apos;m here to tell you
that barry will not be returning to your course .
and i &apos;m here to tell you that your husband called and said
under no circumstances should i let your son weasel out of this .
he called ?
oh , this just got good .
okay , then .
well , i have demands .
instead of yelling ,
you will motivate my baby with kindness and encouragement .
and you will never , ever call him worthless again .
well , considering you &apos;re asking me
to undo years of proven and effective military training ,
the answer is no .
or is it yes ?
according to the school handbook ,
any parent is permitted on school grounds
to tend to the well @-@ being of their child .
that gives me the legal right
to be my son &apos;s wingmom .
wingmom ?
wingmom .
that &apos;s not a thing .
oh , it is .
i &apos;ll see you at 0900 .
no , you won &apos;t .
yes , she will .
that woman isn &apos;t setting one foot in my class ,
and you know why ?
&apos;cause it &apos;s absurd and unrealistic
and will never happen on my watch .
due to circumstances both beyond my control and beyond reason ,
i &apos;d like to welcome a new ridiculous addition
to our class .
it &apos;s me .
what ? !
you were supposed to get me out of this , not join me !
but now we can both feel the need , the need for speed .
together .
i feel that need alone , not with my mom !
i promise you won &apos;t even know i &apos;m here , little schmoo .
little schmoo .
now that should be your code name .
no ! it &apos;s sky shark . that better not stick .
infantilizing , bro !
oh , no . the tastemakers have spoken .
it &apos;s sticking !
with my mom officially enlisted ,
i had officially signed up
for a day of fun and laughter with pop @-@ pop .
hey , where &apos;s all the loose change ?
you promised me pocketfuls of quarters .
while we &apos;re here , might as well play a few games .
what do you think ?
the only game i played when i was a kid
was stop the irish from stealing our jobs .
o @-@ kay .
there &apos;s got to be coins in the fountain .
i &apos;ll hold your legs .
my playdate with pop @-@ pop couldn &apos;t get any worse ...
holy balls !
... until we ran into my ex .
what &apos;s he doing here ? how &apos;s my hair ?
looks like a chia thing .
shut up and laugh like i said something funny .
since when are you funny ?
so fun .
oh . hey , pops .
adam .
didn &apos;t expect to see you here ...
with her .
yeah , i &apos;d love to chat ,
but pops and i are hitting up benetton .
need some resort wear to be ready to jet down to florida
with my main man .
well , i &apos;m happy that you found someone to spend time with .
oh , this one &apos;s the best .
hope you &apos;re having fun , too .
so much fun .
today , i watched pop @-@ pop pick up his prescription
and berate the pharmacist
while i played with the blood @-@ pressure machine .
classic us .
ah , i see what &apos;s going on here .
you &apos;re only hanging out with me to hurt his feelings .
well done .
in your face , al . i &apos;m his favorite grandpa now .
not a competition , ben .
oh , yes . it sure is .
i &apos;ve been waiting for this for years .
you think you &apos;re so great with your pockets full of paper money
and your genuine kindness .
well , no more .
i &apos;m the pops now .
you &apos;re not the pops .
i &apos;ll always be the pops .
no , no . i &apos;m taking it because i hate being called pop @-@ pop .
then pick another name , like , uh , poppy .
oh , hell , no .
pap @-@ pap .
paw @-@ paw .
no , no , no .
face it . i finally beat you , and this little weirdo is my prize .
enough ! i &apos;ve had it with both of you .
no one gets to be my pops !
and for the record , i still won .
come on , goldberg .
the only way out of my class is over that wall ,
you lazy sack of nothing .
don &apos;t you listen to him . you &apos;re a sack of everything !
you need to push that lazy , worthless body ,
or you &apos;ll be a loser forever .
your body is a sweet treasure , and you &apos;re a winner !
say , &quot; i &apos;m a winner ! &quot;
i can &apos;t .
too hard !
you don &apos;t know hard .
now stand up and start from the beginning .
oh , no , no , no , no , no .
he &apos;s done . come with me and rest up , baby .
really ?
really ?
really ?
barry has low energy today because he overslept
and didn &apos;t get a complete breakfast ,
but i have raisins , so we &apos;re good .
oh , are we , now ?
we are .
the school manual clearly states
that nutritional health is one of the most -- - fine .
then everyone else will attack the course except for goldberg ,
who &apos;s gonna sit on the side and eat his box of raisins .
sir , yes , sir ! it &apos;s nature &apos;s candy , sir !
yes . i &apos;ve had raisins .
i can &apos;t believe these came from grapes , sir .
i wonder who came up with the idea for them , sir .
are you done ?
no , sir !
permission to share a few plump raisins with my platoon , sir !
denied !
just go sit on the bleachers and shut up .
the rest of you , move it !
feels pretty good having a wingmom , huh ?
the sun makes them taste so sweet .
hey , there , soldier . how was your day ?
tough as balls , but you were right , dad .
it feels good to stick it out .
it does .
i bet you &apos;re starving .
how about a snack ?
raisin ?
mom , he knows .
he knows ?
he knows .
wait . do you know ?
wingmom ?
he knows .
how do you know ?
i have my sources !
what ? captain wallace tattled ?
bevy , how could you go behind my back and try and help him ?
how could you sign that permission slip behind my back ?
because it &apos;s important .
rotc was the only way i could go to college .
it &apos;s literally the first thing in my life i ever saw through .
and thank god i did , because the guy i was before
wouldn &apos;t have had a shot with you or any of this .
look , look , you guys both win .
thanks to mom , i get to protect my country
in a way that suits my lifestyle --
being a hero without working hard .
well ... mission accomplished .
oh , so good .
officially grandfather @-@ less ,
i decided to go to my favorite place in the world to cheer up .
right there with you , pac .
you can &apos;t rely on anyone .
i got next game .
not talking to me , huh ?
all right . let &apos;s play for it .
if i beat you , then you got to listen to me .
if not , i &apos;m gone .
deal ?
you ? play me ?
at ms. pac @-@ man ?
my best game ?
let &apos;s just say your old grandpa
may have some skills that might surprise you .
it was a game of legend .
our entire relationship was on the line .
in that moment ,
pops played that machine ...
like he never played it before .
i did it !
i win !
actually , you lost .
well , that &apos;s crazy .
my angry ghosts killed that pac @-@ woman over and over .
you &apos;re not the ghosts .
i &apos;m not the ghosts ?
you &apos;re the pac @-@ woman .
i &apos;m the pac @-@ woman ?
you &apos;re the pac @-@ woman .
well i @-@ i guess it &apos;s goodbye .
as i was losing my wingman ,
barry was ready for another day with his wingmom .
mom , rotc &apos;s in 20 minutes .
why aren &apos;t you dressed in your camo sweater ?
honey , i &apos;m not going .
but you are . alone .
what ?
you never leave your wingman , and you &apos;re my wingmom .
here . i want to show you something .
this is a picture of your dad at his rotc graduation .
who does he look like to you ?
me .
look , your dad had nothing growing up ,
but he was able to make so much of himself
because he wasn &apos;t a quitter .
i think i protect you so much , i &apos;ve turned you into one .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m ripping up my list of dangerous jobs .
does this mean those jobs are no longer off @-@ limits ?
what you want to be in life is up to you ,
no matter how scary it is for me .
even a trapeze artist ?
don &apos;t push it .
goldberg ...
we don &apos;t normally say this in the military , but ...
where &apos;s your mother ?
i &apos;m flying solo today , captain .
turns out , even without a wingmom ,
barry could still soar on his own .
as for me , when pops walked out of that arcade ,
i realized i could never fly as high without him .
i &apos;ve been informed that you &apos;re a sucker for a sales pitch ,
so i figured you may want to sit for this .
depends what you &apos;re selling .
us .
by a show of hands , how many of you fine folks
have a grandson who you &apos;ve helped raise ?
and how many of you are willing to forgive said grandson
for acting like a selfish putz ?
&apos;cause the truth is , no matter where you live ,
you &apos;ll always be my hero , always be my best friend ,
always be my pops .
sold .
and that &apos;s how i made peace with my pops .
sometimes it takes almost losing someone
to make you realize just how much you need them .
as for pop @-@ pop , he &apos;d always be
the kind of grandfather who didn &apos;t need much ,
but deep down inside , i knew that he still needed me .
and , to be honest , i needed him , too .
that &apos;s the thing about the people we love .
they &apos;re there at our lowest ...
well done , boys . only one thing to do now .
yeah , there is !
... and they &apos;re there when we &apos;re flying high ,
helping us celebrate our biggest victories .
truth is you can win any battle
when your family &apos;s got your back ,
&apos;cause no matter what life throws at you ,
it &apos;s easy for a maverick when he &apos;s got goose at his side .
winner !
dang it !
that &apos;s life in the fast lane , kiddo .
how many girls do you think you &apos;ve dated in your life ?
too numerous to mention .
sir , i figured it out .
i know why you were so mad at my nicknames .
they weren &apos;t good enough .
lucky for you , i got some more .
i was very clear .
no call signs , no nicknames .
but what about sky monkey ?
no .
air dragon ?
no .
air jordan ?
no .
thunder hornet ?
no .
sky dagger ?
my god .
sky monkey .
you already said that .
wolf man .
no !
iron beagle ?
no .
mach nine ?
no .
mock turtleneck ?
no .
handsome barry ?
no .
tall barry ?
no .
applesauce ?
yes ! that &apos;s the one !
applesauce . you are applesauce .
no !
oh , yes .
that &apos;s just filler .
i was saying that so you could warm up to sky shark .
pick sky shark !
