you know , i &apos;ve been thinking about time travel again .
why , did you hit a roadblock with invisibility ?
put it on the back burner .
anyway , it occurs to me if i ever did perfect a time machine ,
i would just go into the past and give it to myself ,
thus eliminating the need for me to invent it in the first place .
interesting .
yeah , it really takes the pressure off .
sounds like a breakthrough .
should i call science magazine and tell them to hold the cover ?
it &apos;s time travel , leonard , i will have already done that .
then i guess congratulations are in order .
no , congratulations will have been in order .
you know , i am not going to enjoy this party .
i know , i &apos;m familiar with you .
the last department party , professor finkleday cornered me
and talked about spelunking for 45 minutes .
yes , i was there .
you know what &apos;s interesting about caves , leonard ?
what ?
nothing .
well , then we &apos;ll avoid finkleday , we &apos;ll meet the new department head ,
congratulate him , shake his hand and go .
how &apos;s this ?
&quot; pleased to meet you , dr.gablehauser.
&quot; how fortunate for you that the university &apos;s &quot; chosen to hire you ,
despite the fact &quot; that you &apos;ve done no original research in 25 years ,
&quot; and instead have written a series of popular books &quot;
that reduce the great concepts of science &quot; to a series of anecdotes ,
&quot; each one dumbed down to accommodate the duration
of an average bowel movement .
mahalo .
&quot; mahalo &apos;s &quot; a nice touch .
you know there only eight consonants in the hawaiian language ?
interesting . you should lead with that .
oh , god , look at this buffet .
i love america .
you don &apos;t have buffets in india ?
of course , but it &apos;s all indian food .
you can &apos;t find a bagel in mumbai to save your life .
shmear me .
well , here &apos;s an interesting turn of events .
what ?
howard brought a date ?
a more plausible explanation is
that his work in robotics has made an amazing leap forward .
hey , what up , science bitches ?
may i introduce my special lady friend summer ?
howard , i told you touching &apos;s extra .
right . sorry .
here comes our new boss . be polite .
hi , fellas .
eric gablehauser .
howard wolowitz .
howard , nice to meet you . and you are ?
an actual real scientist .
how was that ?
i can &apos;t believe he fired me .
well , you did call him a glorified high school science teacher
whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts .
in my defense , i prefaced that by saying , &quot; with all due respect . &quot;
morning .
morning .
you &apos;re making eggs for breakfast ?
this isn &apos;t breakfast , it &apos;s an experiment .
&apos;cause it looks a lot like breakfast .
i finally have time to test my hypothesis about the separation of the water molecules
from the egg proteins and its impact vis @-@ a @-@ vis taste .
sounds yummy .
i look forward to your work with bacon .
as do i.
you know , i &apos;m sure if you just apologize to gablehauser ,
he would give you your job back .
i don &apos;t want my job back .
i &apos;ve spent the past three and a half years staring at grease boards full of equations .
before that , i spent four years working on my thesis .
before that , i was in college , and before that , i was in the fifth grade .
this is my first d oayff in decades and i &apos;m going to savor it .
okay .
i &apos;ll let you get back to fixing your eggs .
not just fixing my eggs , i &apos;m fixing everyone &apos;s eggs .
and we all thank you .
use new eggs .
hi . hey , i &apos;m running out to the market .
do you guys need anything ?
oh , well , this would be one of those circumstances that
people unfamiliar with the law of large numbers would call a coincidence .
i &apos;m sorry ?
i need eggs .
four dozen should suffice .
four dozen ?
yes , and evenly distributed amongst brown , white ,
free @-@ range , large , extra large and jumbo .
okay , one more time .
never mind . you won &apos;t get it right .
i &apos;d better come with you .
oh , yay .
how come you didn &apos;t go into work today ?
i &apos;m taking a sabbatical because i won &apos;t kowtow to mediocre minds .
so you got canned , huh ?
theoretical physicists do not get canned ...
but yeah .
well , maybe it &apos;s all for the best .
you know , i always say when one door closes , another one opens .
no , it doesn &apos;t .
not unless the two doors are connected by relays
or there are motion sensors involved .
no , no , i meant ...
or if the first door closing creates a change of air pressure
that acts upon the second door .
never mind .
slow down .
slow down . please , slow down !
we &apos;re fine !
you &apos;re not leaving yourself enough space between cars .
oh , sure , i am .
no , no , let me do the math for you .
this car weighs , let &apos;s say 4,000 pounds .
now add 140 for me , 120 for you ...
120 ?
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
did i insult you ?
is your body mass somehow tied into your self @-@ worth ?
well , yeah .
interesting .
anyway , that gives us a total weight of , let &apos;s say 4,400 pounds .
let &apos;s say 4,390 .
fine .
we &apos;re traveling forward at-- good lord-- 51 miles an hour .
now let &apos;s assume that your brakes are new and the calipers are aligned .
still , by the time we come to a stop ,
we &apos;ll be occupying the same space as that buick in front of us ,
an impossibility that nature will quickly resolve into death , mutilation ...
oh , look , they built a new putt @-@ putt course .
this is great .
look at me .
i &apos;m in the real world of ordinary people
just living their ordinary , colorless workaday lives .
thank you .
no , thank you .
and thank you , ordinary person .
hey , you want to hear an interesting thing about tomatoes ?
uh , no , no , not really .
listen , didn &apos;t you say you needed some eggs ?
yes , but anyone who knows anything about the dynamics of bacterial growth
knows to pick up their refrigerated foods on the way out of the supermarket .
oh , okay , well , then maybe you should start heading on out then .
no , this is fun .
oh , the thing about tomatoes-- and i think you &apos;ll really enjoy this--
is they &apos;re shelved with the vegetables , but they &apos;re technically a fruit .
oh , interesting .
isn &apos;t it ?
no , i mean what you find enjoyable .
oh , boy .
what now ?
well , there &apos;s some value to taking a multivitamin ,
but the human body can only absorb so much .
what you &apos;re buying here are the ingredients for very expensive urine .
well , maybe that &apos;s what i was going for .
well , then you &apos;ll want some manganese .
well , that was fun .
maybe tomorrow we can go to one of those big warehouse stores .
oh , i don &apos;t know , sheldon .
it &apos;s going to take me a while to recover from all the fun i had today .
are you sure ?
there are a lot of advantages to buying in bulk .
for example , i noticed that you purchase your tampons one @-@ month supply at a time .
what ?
think about it .
it &apos;s a product that doesn &apos;t spoil
and you &apos;re going to be needing them for at least the next 30 years .
you want me to buy 30 years worth of tampons ?
well , 30,35 . when did your mother go into menopause ?
okay .
i &apos;m not talking about this with you .
oh , penny , this is a natural human process
and we &apos;re talking about statistically significant savings .
now , if you assume 15 tampons per cycle and a 28 @-@ day cycle ...
are you fairly regular ?
okay , no warehouse store , but we &apos;re still on for putt @-@ putt golf , right ?
hey , i just ran into penny .
she seemed upset about something .
i think it &apos;s her time of the month .
i marked the calendar for future reference .
what &apos;s with the fish ?
it &apos;s an experiment .
what happened to your scrambled egg research ?
oh , that was a dead end .
scrambled eggs are as good as they &apos;re ever going to be .
so ... fish ?
i read an article about japanese scientists
who inserted dna from luminous jellyfish into other animals
and i thought , &quot; hey , fish nightlights .
fish nightlights ?
it &apos;s a billion @-@ dollar idea .
mum &apos;s the word .
sheldon , are you sure you don &apos;t want to
just apologize to gablehauser and get your job back ?
oh , no , no , no , i have too much to do .
like luminous fish .
i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t ...
that &apos;s just the beginning .
i also have an idea for a bulk mail @-@ order feminine hygiene company .
oh , glow @-@ in @-@ the @-@ dark tampons !
leonard , we &apos;re gonna be rich .
thanks for coming on such short notice .
well , you did the right thing calling .
i didn &apos;t know what else to do .
he &apos;s lost all focus .
every day he &apos;s got a new obsession .
this is a particularly disturbing one .
mommy ?
hi , baby !
oh , you got yourself a loom ? how nice !
thank you .
honey , why &apos;d you get a loom ?
i was working with luminous fish , and i thought , hey ...
&quot; loom . &quot;
mom , what are you doing here ?
leonard called me .
i know , but why ?
because one of the great minds of the 21st century
is raising glow @-@ in @-@ the @-@ dark fish and weaving serapes .
this is not a serape , this is a poncho .
a serape is open at the sides ; a poncho is closed .
this is a poncho .
and neither is a reason to call someone &apos;s mother .
really ? when was the last time you left the house ?
i went to the market with penny .
yeah , that was three weeks ago .
well , then buckle up-- in the next four to eight days she &apos;s going to get very crabby .
sweetheart , your little friend is concerned about you .
yes , well , i &apos;m not a child-- i &apos;m a grown man , capable of living my life as i see fit .
and i certainly don &apos;t need someone telling on me to my mother !
wait , where are you going ?
to my room-- and no one &apos;s allowed in !
oh , he gets his temper from his daddy .
he &apos;s got my eyes .
i see .
all that science stuff , that comes from jesus .
sheldon , your mom made dinner .
i &apos;m not hungry !
oh , leonard , don &apos;t trouble yourself . he &apos;s stubborn .
he may stay in there till the rapture .
we so sure that &apos;s a bad thing ?
i tell you , i love the boy to death , but he has been difficult
since he fell out of me at the k @-@ mart .
excuse me for being so bold , but i now see where sheldon gets his smoldering good looks .
honey , that ain &apos;t gonna work , but you keep tryin &apos; .
i made chicken .
i hope that isn &apos;t one of the animals that you people think is magic .
you know , we have an indian gentleman at our church ,
a dr.patel-- it &apos;s a beautiful story .
the lord spoke to him and moved him to give us all 20 % off on lasik--
you know , those that needed it .
that is a lovely story .
um , are we gonna do anything about sheldon ?
oh , we will .
you have to take your time with sheldon .
his father , god rest his soul , used to always say to me ,
&quot; mary , you have to take your time with sheldon . &quot;
sounds like a wise man .
oh , not so wise .
he once tried to fight a bobcat for some licorice .
so , everybody grab a plate and a pretty place mat that shelly wove .
has shelly ever freaked out like this before ?
oh , all the time .
i remember one summer when he was 13,
he built a small nuclear reactor in the shed
and told everybody he was gonna provide free electricity for the whole town .
well , the only problem was , he had no what you call &quot; fissionable &quot; materials .
anyway , when he went on the internets to get some ,
a man from the government came by and sat him down real gentle ,
and told him it &apos;s against the law to have yellow @-@ cake uranium in a shed .
well , what happened ?
well , poor boy had a fit .
locked himself in his room and built a sonic death ray .
a death ray ?
well , that &apos;s what he called it .
didn &apos;t even slow down the neighbor kids .
it pissed our dog off to no end .
you know , you two make a cute couple .
uh , no . we &apos;re not ...
we &apos;re not @-@ not a couple . we &apos;re singles .
two singles .
yeah .
like those ... individually wrapped slices of cheese that ...
we &apos;re friends .
did i pluck a nerve there ?
oh , yeah .
okay .
all right , everybody , it &apos;s time to eat .
oh , lord , we thank you for this meal and all of your bounty .
and we pray that you help sheldon get back on his rocker .
now , after a moment of silent meditation , i &apos;m gonna end with &quot; in jesus &apos; name , &quot;
but you two don &apos;t feel any obligation to join in .
unless , of course , the holy spirit moves you .
oh , my god , this is the best cobbler i &apos;ve ever had .
it was always sheldon &apos;s favorite .
you know w thathe secret ingredient is ?
love ?
lard .
hey , look who &apos;s come ...
you &apos;ll spook him .
he &apos;s like a baby deer-- you got to let him come to you .
this is ridiculous .
damn it , sheldon , snap out of it !
you &apos;re a physicist--
you belong at the university doing research , not hiding in your room !
you don &apos;t hunt , do you ?
good morning , snickerdoodle .
morning .
oh , well , that looks awful fancy . what is that ?
it &apos;s my idea of what dna would look like in a silicon @-@ based life @-@ form .
but intelligently designed by a creator , right ?
what do you want , mom ?
you know how your daddy used to say that
you can only fish for so long
before you got to throw a stick of dynamite in the water ?
yeah .
well , i &apos;m done fishing .
you put those on .
what for ?
because you &apos;re gonna go down to your office ,
you &apos;re gonna apologize to your boss and get your job back .
no .
i &apos;m sorry , did i start that sentence with the words , &quot; if it please your highness &quot; ?
i &apos;m not going to apologize-- i didn &apos;t say anything that wasn &apos;t true .
now , you listen here .
i have been telling you since you were four years old ,
it &apos;s okay to be smarter than everybody , but you can &apos;t go around pointing it out .
why not ?
because people don &apos;t like it !
remember all the ass @-@ kickings you got from the neighbor kids ?
now , let &apos;s get crackin &apos; .
shower , shirt , shoes , and let &apos;s shove off .
there wouldn &apos;t have been any ass @-@ kickings if that stupid death ray had worked .
problem solved .
really ?
that &apos;s impressive .
leonard , the lord never gives us more than we can handle .
thankfully , he blessed me with two other children who are dumb as soup .
excuse me , dr.gablehauser , are you busy ?
well , actually ...
sheldon , he &apos;s just doodlin &apos; .
get in here .
dr.gablehauser.
dr.cooper.
let &apos;s go , baby-- we &apos;re losing daylight .
as you know , several weeks ago in our first encounter ,
we may have gotten off on the wrong foot when i called you an idiot .
and i just wanted to say that i was wrong ...
to point it out .
i &apos;m sorry , we haven &apos;t been introduced .
dr.eric gablehauser .
mary cooper , sheldon &apos;s mom .
now , that &apos;s impossible--
you must have had him when you were a teenager .
oh , aren &apos;t you sweet .
his father &apos;s dead .
recently ?
long enough .
please .
sheldon , shouldn &apos;t you be working ?
okay .
hey , how did it go ?
i got my job back .
really ? what happened ?
i &apos;m not quite sure .
it involves a part of the human experience that has always eluded me .
well , that narrows it down .
i &apos;m very proud of you , honey .
you showed a lot of courage today .
thanks , mom .
mom ?
is dr.gablehauser going to be my new daddy ?
we &apos;ll see .
