Morning.
Floater.
Manhole.
What are you doing?
Well, I've been thinking about
how you're leaving for the FBI Academy,
and I'm going to Paris.
Teeth.
Statues.
This is your idea of a trip down memory lane?
I realize that most of our shared experiences
aren't documented.
You mean other than with extensive departmental paperwork
and court transcripts?
Which are cold and impersonal,
so I have decided to make a virtual memory book.
With crime scene photos?
Yes.
I mean, how many fascinating crime scenes have we shared?
Community theater.
Sex party.
Revolutionary war reenactment.
High school reunion.
Refrigerator.
Body farm.
Church. Fishing tournament.
I'm going to miss you.
Well, I'm not gone yet.
No, but almost.
How many more of these experiences are we gonna have?
Well, unless this is my mother
demanding more cheese curls for Korsak's retirement party,
I'd say at least one more.
Rizzoli.
Isles.
Remember that guy?
Doesn't seem so sexy when it ends up like that, huh?
Robert Riley, 35 years old.
Apparently married.
Is she here?
No.
And it looks like a suitcase is missing from the closet.
Her underwear drawer is empty.
If I'm running for my life,
I'm not sure I'd take the time.
But if I'm packing to leave after I kill my husband...
Well, clean underwear would be
at the top of my on-the-lam list.
Life on the lam would be a little rough
at the Four Seasons, Ma Barker.
Cute. But you'd never find me.
I'd be at the Ritz.
Anyway, it appears as though our victim has been decapitated.
No disrespect, Doc,
But that head is still on that neck.
An orthopedic decapitation,
an atlanto-occipital dislocation.
Well, what do you know?
Can that happen in some weird sex game?
Can't say.
Maura, just one little guess.
A small surmise.
It appears as though he received a high-energy strike
from a very large, blunt object --
Something flexible and without rough edges.
Did you find any balloon animals?
Not even a balloon.
All right, I will check with Frankie,
have him search the neighborhood,
see if anybody saw a rogue blimp on the loose.
I shouldn't have said anything.
And miss all this fun?
Aw, gee, maura.
It had to be panda.
Nothing like this ever happens around here.
If it did, I would know.
Did Robert and his wife ever --
Uh, Elaine -- that's her name.
And did Robert and Elaine ever fight?
Oh, I wouldn't know what goes on behind closed doors.
Did you ever hear them arguing?
No. No, not at all.
I do know that Robert would,
uh, leave every morning at 8:00,
I assume to work.
He came back at about noon, stayed for an hour,
and then, uh, left again until 5:00.
I'm sorry, detective. My mom means to be helpful.
Oh, she is. And your name is...?
Steve. Steve Browning.
Did you know the Rileys?
Not really.
Uh, is this connected to the break-ins?
Break-ins?
Mom, didn't you say something about a black truck?
Oh, that's right.
I saw it several times, driving back and forth.
Very suspicious.
Very.
Hey, Ma.
Hey, Janey.
Okay, I better not be here because I can reach high places.
No, no, no. I have something for you.
I mean, I didn't mean for you to rush on over.
Well, your text said it was important.
It's important. It's just not urgent.
It reminded me of you.
Yeah, uh...
Yeah, no, that's -- that's totally me.
Yeah, well, I figured where you're going,
you would need an extra suitcase.
Ma, I'm going to the FBI. I'm not going on safari.
Yeah, but you could have school supplies and books
and manuals and stuff.
Who carries manuals in a suitcase?
I just want you to think about me when you're gone.
Ok-okay, okay, okay. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
And, you know, come on.
You know, of course I would think about you.
But not because of this. This is hideous.
I'm going back to work.
I started the search of marriage records in Boston.
According to this,
Robert Riley and Elaine Chan were married six months ago.
What?
Nothing.
Nope.
What?
You can't kiss me at the office.
I know that.
You know, we do have to tell everyone
that we're engaged.
What are you doing?
I wasn't spying.
It looks like you were spying.
Yes, I know.
It's just no one will agree to do
these testimonials for the party, and I've --
I've resorted to sneaking up on people.
You need to erase that.
Oh, yeah. I will.
I do not want to be the spiller of beans.
I'll record mine. Come back in one hour.
Oh, thank you, Nina.
And let me just be the first to say
Thank you?
That's beautiful. What's it mean?
It means, "May you not see a pig
on the way to your wedding."
You guys rock.
One hour.
Yeah. One hour.
Oh, hey, Jane.
No.
All right. I'll catch you later then.
Unless that's Bass,
you got a suitcase from ma.
She told me it was meant to complement my personality.
Mine is covered in leopard spots.
Oh, the leopard is incredibly intelligent
and astoundingly strong.
They are elusive, secretive, and beautiful.
I'm sorry you're a turtle.
Tortoise.
They're known for their serenity and steadfastness,
and they've become a symbol of wisdom.
I underestimated ma. I just thought they were ugly.
What do we got here?
Well, not only is there
an atlanto-occipital dislocation,
but there's significant damage to C-3 and C-4.
Which would take a tremendous force.
And an object at least 10 inches wide.
So it seems unlikely that this happened
while he was handcuffed to the bed.
So someone placed him on the bed
to make it look like a sex game gone wrong.
What's he weigh? About 250?
Close.
117.196 kilograms.
258 pounds, 6 ounces.
Thank you.
There's something else.
Subcutaneous hemorrhaging to the right thenar muscle.
So he hit something or someone.
All right. Thanks.
Think you ever would've run out of
crazy medical terms to say to me?
Would you let the door hit you in the face as you entered?
Of course not.
Okay, let's do this.
Okay.
Cue, Nina.
I came here from Chicago and didn't know anyone.
I didn't really want to know anyone.
But you were kind, patient, funny.
I was so worried about being the newcomer,
and from the first moment,
you all treated me like you've known me forever.
And I hope we'll be a part of each other's lives forever.
Because that's a lot better than saying goodbye.
That's beautiful.
All right. Thanks.
Yep. Okay.
You gotta do that today?
You got like a month left.
Oh, I've got 15 unused sick days
and two weeks vacation.
Really?
Yeah. You probably have much more. Have you checked?
No.
What? You assume you're gonna die with it all unused?
Yes, sitting right here at this desk,
surrounded by 42 empty cups of coffee.
Pretty picture.
So you're done today?!
Today.
This what you had in mind?
Oh, perfect. Thanks.
I hate this!
And something for you.
Robert Riley was a plumber.
Had his own small, one-man operation.
And no criminal record,
No restraining order, no lawsuits.
Money problems?
His credit report is clean,
And his business is solvent.
Any trace of the wife?
Got no hit on the BOLO, checked the airlines
and ran the name Elaine Chan through ICE -- nothing.
She has no credit cards, bank accounts,
and no driver's license.
It's like she didn't exist,
except for being married to Robert.
Well, we know she exists. The neighbors saw her.
Well, I'll keep digging.
Okay, thanks.
I'm gonna take a load of this stuff down to my car.
I'll give you a hand.
Hi, babe.
What are you doing here?
Well, I knew you were doing all this yourself,
So I, uh, took the day off to help.
Best boyfriend ever!
So, Jane and Maura
still don't know this party's for them, too?
Nope.
They're completely in the dark.
You know, you never really, uh,
told me how you feel about everyone leaving.
I don't know.
Sometimes it helps to talk about things.
Did I ever tell you
that I used to force Jane to come to Sunday dinner?
I insisted, no matter how busy she was.
But after a while,
she and Frankie used to come every Sunday,
Hungry for lasagna.
And then Maura joined,
and sometimes Korsak and Kiki,
and now Nina.
It's my gang. It's my normal.
I, uh...
I just don't know
If my lasagna will taste the same
without everybody at the table.
What are you doing?
What?
Kent told me that you weren't cooperating
with the video.
I was totally cooperating.
Too late. It's already gone.
Oh, you are the worst boyfriend ever.
No, I'm not.
Yes, you are.
And that was lovely.
And I really did come to help, so tell me what I can do.
Oh, I do have one thing you can help me with.
This way.
You rang?
Yes.
Did you find Elaine Chan?
Not yet,
but I did locate Robert's mother in Florida.
She only met Elaine on Skype.
Okay.
Is this on?
Oh, God!
Hi, Angela.
Hi. I did it!
We're teaching her how to Skype.
Who's "we"?
Hi, Jane.
Hey, Ron.
Look. You two look so cute.
What happened? I can't see her anymore.
I'm here.
This is fun!
I mean, I'm gonna be able to talk to you every day,
and see you every day.
And you know what? I could watch you teach.
Yeah, that is great.
I'm sure the recruits will love that.
You know what? Hey, let's...
let's practice something else.
You see the -- the top row of keys there?
Yeah.
Okay, find F10.
Honey, they all say F-something.
Okay. Oh, I found it.
Okay. Go ahead and press that.
We will talk about this later.
Sorry.
So good.
Oh, hey. What's up?
You working for a moving company now?
Got a contact in the mailroom.
Oh, yeah? Did she teach you how to Skype yet?
Your mother's gonna show me.
Look what we found.
Elaine Chan looks to be married
to at least two other men in Massachusetts.
Elaine's a bigamist?
Or Elaine Chan's a phony name.
Also, about a month before they were married,
Robert paid $5,000 to Second Pleasure Enterprises.
They're not a registered corporation
with the secretary of state's office,
but they do have a small web presence.
So, Robert dies handcuffed to his bed in his red satin boxers,
and now we find out he gave 5 grand to this place?
Second Pleasure could be a cover for sex-trafficking.
I'm gonna look into these other marriages.
And I'll call you once I find an address for second pleasure.
Okay.
And I will give you $1,000 if you will stop packing.
I am lying, but it's worth it to see you in the chair again.
Why can't I find the cotton swabs and the sterile water?
Well, that's not where they go.
Yeah, sorry, I made a few changes.
Well, why would you make any changes?
For my own ease?
But rearranging things before you went on vacation
was insensitive.
I'm sorry, Maura.
N-no. No, I'm the one that should be sorry.
I'm just --
I just can't get used to the idea
that I'm taking a leave of absence,
even for a little while.
Well, do you know what?
I look forward to reading the book
that you'll write in this brief respite.
Ready to do your video now?
No.
You're very grumpy. Did you know that?
Still, no.
You got anything for me?
Maybe.
We found linseed oil and beeswax on the victim's neck.
Also, I'm doing additional tests
to determine the origins of both substances.
We found two DNA profiles inside the house --
one from our victim, the other from a female.
Did you get a match in CODIS?
No, but when you find the wife,
we'll be able to tell if she put the cuffs on her husband.
Oh, great.
What is it?
Oh, our only lead is a strip club in Chinatown.
Nobody talks in strip clubs.
So that means you're gonna
have to go undercover as a stripper?
We've done worse.
I'll get my tassels.
Hey. Sorry to keep you waiting.
I didn't actually think you'd show up,
so I didn't leave the BPD
until you texted that you were actually here.
Do you get punched a lot?
Not as much as you'd think.
Okay.
I'm ready when you are.
I hate endings.
The truth is I hate beginnings, too.
I like middles, the steady sameness,
comfortable forever.
But I guess I've been doing this long enough to know
you don't always get to pick when life changes.
So...
I know I have no choice but to embrace this,
and I'm gonna make it the best version of a next step that I can.
I'm gonna miss you.
All of you.
The bar is always open.
Korsak.
Hard candy shell, soft nougat center.
Oh, for god's sake!
It's not your grandfather's strip club,
but it's still creepy.
That it is.
Good afternoon, sir. My name is Josh Walker.
I am the proprietor.
Regretfully, you cannot have your own lady friend in the club.
Nobody's lady friend. Boston homicide.
Oh, yes, detective, please. Please, come on in.
May I offer you something to drink,
or, uh, uh, a booth perhaps?
We don't want any drinks, we don't want a booth.
We just want some answers.
What do you have going on here, Josh?
This is a social club,
a place for middle-aged men,
to meet women without the stress of traditional dating.
This is a legitimate business, detective.
I'm a very successful matchmaker.
Really?
'Cause to me, it looks like you're a pimp.
I swear, officers, that -- that's all I do.
I -- I introduce decent men
to recently-arrived to this country,
but equally decent women.
5 grand for an introduction seems a little steep.
That -- that's a membership fee.
He a member?
Robert, yes, yes. Just got married.
Very happy.
Well, he was until somebody broke his neck
and killed him.
Oh, my. Who would do that?
Maybe you.
Me? N-no, no, no.
I haven't even talked to him since this engagement.
Besides, that man could eat me for breakfast.
Okay, let's say we buy that.
Elaine is missing.
Do you have any idea why or where she might be?
You know, I always say,
"Love is so hard to facilitate."
Which means these women
don't have valid immigration status?
N-n-no, they do. Ev-every woman here is fine.
They're fine.
We can take you downtown
and put a big sign on the door that says, "Closed."
Her -- her real name isn't Elaine. It's wei.
I-I put Robert and Wei in touch with the real Elaine.
Wei have a last name?
Wei Chan.
Well, maybe she has a file.
Maybe Elaine has a file.
Maybe you get up and go get them.
Okay.
You think Wei ran because she killed Robert?
Even if somebody else killed him,
maybe she ran 'cause she didn't want to get shipped home.
Love only goes so far.
39C, press this button...
Kent.
Okay, I only have a few minutes.
Uh, all right. Um, I'm just about ready.
Hey, did you get rid of the stuff with me and Nina?
No, I -- I haven't done it yet, but I promise I will.
It's just, I've got some -- some great footage
just before your, uh, your big reveal. Yeah?
Well, I'm worried that if I erase your stuff,
I'm going to erase that, too.
Okay.
Oh, hey. Look, it's ready -- the camera.
All right.
Hey, let me just get a little bit of focus here.
Okay, uh...
I know this isn't goodbye.
I mean, we're family, all of us.
And sure, I'm gonna miss
seeing you guys every day,
But mainly...
I'm filled with a sense of gratitude.
You've helped me to be a better man and a better cop.
I'm gonna hold down the fort here.
And I think --
No, I -- I know
That I'm gonna make you proud.
Yes, she's my niece.
You know where she is?
She returned to china.
Really? When?
Last night.
You know why?
She would be sent home anyway.
This seemed easier.
Did she kill him?
Yes. But it was an accident.
We're gonna need the whole story.
Robert was a good husband at first.
But I think he began to believe
that Wei was using him for paper.
You can't get papers
if you get married using someone else's name.
Yes, but Robert stopped caring about the truth of this.
He just wanted to control her.
He wouldn't let her talk to anyone or visit me anymore.
He locked her in the house. He beat her.
Do you have proof of that?
She went to the hospital twice.
She had to lie about why.
How do you know she's gone?
I gave her the money for an airplane ticket.
Do you know you could be arrested
for helping a killer evade justice?
She -- she was just defending herself.
We're gonna need you to stay put.
We're gonna put you on a no-fly list
until we're done with our investigation.
She's lying.
Yeah, but about which part?
The leaving? The killing?
The leaving. Frankie!
Hey! Out of the way!
Get out of the car!
Show us your hands!
Out of the car.
Out of the car!
Face the glass.
The chasing -- not gonna miss so much.
Has Jane done her video yet?
No.
Well, maybe I'll wait for her
and just see what kind of a tone she strikes.
I'm guessing aggressive and sarcastic.
Probably not your style.
I just don't know what to say.
If it was me, I'd be like, "Hey, Mom. I miss you.
Russell, good luck with the baby.
Scotland, the brave."
But that makes no sense in this context.
But it's what's in my heart.
And you should say what's in yours.
Okay.
When I started this job,
I thought it would be gratifying
to help victims of homicide through my forensic work,
which it has been,
and also, so much more.
This adventure has made me more alive.
And you have been the big family I never had.
And you've brought so much joy and laughter into my life.
And for this, I will be forever grateful.
And maybe, just this once, on the record,
I am willing to speculate this --
I'll love you, and I'll never forget you.
How was that?
Good.
I'm really sad.
Mrs. Riley, let's go over this one more time.
Tell me what happened.
I'm so sorry.
So sorry.
I understand. I understand, but I just --
What did the wife say?
Same thing as her aunt.
So the handcuffs weren't for sex?
He was holding her prisoner?
Seems that way.
That's a very tidy desk, sergeant.
I hate it.
But you're leaving, too.
Yeah, but look at my desk.
I'm so sick of goodbyes.
Will you please distract me with science?
The linseed oil and the beeswax on the back of Robert's neck
are from car wax,
the same kind that was on Robert's car.
Car bumpers are flexible.
Newer ones are, yeah.
Could he have been hit by a car?
There were no abrasions or bruising
to indicate that a car hit him.
What if he hit the car?
You know, like, if he was pushed and he fell,
would his own weight decapitate him
when his head hit the bumper?
That is possible.
How much does Wei Chan weigh?
110, soaking wet.
This guy weighs, what, 258 and 6 ounces.
Well, she's not strong enough to kill him, much less move him.
Then why say she did?
To protect somebody else.
She's not changing her story.
She will.
Now a good time?
Sure.
You sure?
Yeah.
Congratulations, Frankie.
Frank.
Thank you, Maura.
Now what?
Well, now we try and figure out who Wei is protecting.
Okay. I'll get right on it.
Thank you.
Sweetheart?
Is it possible you checked "Bachelorette party" on the form
instead of "Bon-voyage party"?
What? What do you mean?
Oh, shit!
I didn't order this.
I didn't order that.
No?
No, but I can fix it.
I just need some cream of tartar,
food coloring, and powdered sugar.
Stat.
Yep.
In the kitchen.
Okay.
Right here, please.
Dr. Drake, was Robert dead before or after he was moved to the bed?
Well, based on lividity,
it was clear he was moved afterwards.
Thank you.
Yeah, you're welcome.
You told Detective Rizzoli
that you were alone in the house when you killed Robert.
Yes.
Go ahead and pick up that dummy
And move it, uh, there.
We both know you can't do that, huh?
I know that robert was beating you.
We went to some of your local hospitals.
We found some nurses who remembered you being brought in
with someone who looked like...Him.
Okay.
This is how this is gonna go.
We're gonna leave and let you two talk.
You can stick to your stories
And know that we will figure out what happened,
And then justice will take its course.
Or you can tell us the truth.
If Robert was beating you,
and you didn't intentionally kill him,
The choice seems pretty clear.
Think they'll confess?
They will if they know what's good for 'em.
You solved a murder on your last day on the job.
Not bad.
How come I don't feel better about it?
This, uh...
This should stay here.
Janey...
Why don't you take him?
No, no, no.
He, uh...
He should stay here... with you.
You know, he'd probably be your partner by now, so...
He should be --
He should be here to look after you.
Hi.
Hey.
Wei chan admitted
that her husband had been beating her for months.
Well, the reports and x-rays you gave me from the hospitals
are consistent with abuse.
Um, Steve was the neighbor across the street,
Helped her start getting treatment,
They fell in love, decided to run away together.
Robert came home early and caught them packing the car.
When he went after Steve,
He slipped and hit his neck on the bumper.
Well...
...It's my last case.
Nobody goes to jail, two people go to china,
Unless...
Please! Please, please, please.
I would really love one more call before my shift is over.
You don't want it to end?
No, I don't want to go to this party ma's throwing for us.
You know, she thought she did such a good job hiding it.
She did.
But I just know her well enough to know
that she can't resist giving us a big sendoff.
Well, that's it.
My shift is officially over.
So it's really coming to an end. Yeah.
We had some good times, though.
Hey. Oh, look at that!
No. Do you find it so hard to imagine yourself living here.
hey. I'm sorry.
Lemon water, please.
Maura, stop it,
Or they're going to charge us for the robes again.
Do I look bad-ass?
Yeah, you look like a bad-ass. Okay.
But I have a new apartment!
It's a turbo.
Yeah, it is.
No!
No crying! Come on.
Our locations are changing. That's it.
I know.
I'm gonna go get dressed for this party.
I'll see you there, okay?
Be right behind you.
All right.
See you at the party.
You're not getting off that easily.
There's no need.
yeah, you're totally right.
It's just a distinguished 32-year career.
By all means, let's let it end with no comment.
You're gonna make me cry.
Welcome to the club.
Victor-nine-eight-one. Ocean-frank.
Thank you for your service, sergeant Korsak.
Job well done.
yeah, I'll see you.
Oh, good. I have something to show you.
hi. I'm Jane.
What are you doing?
on this ipad, i have made a video for tonight's party.
I've left 40 seconds for you.
If you do not wish to make a video,
Then I'm going to fill those 40 seconds with "Sock Jane."
I'm so upset about the changes in my life
That instead of making a video -- -fine, I'll do it.
I am not going to miss you.
I use anger to hide my emotions.
I love you, Kent.
stop it. Stop it.
I've been with this group for a short time,
And I am still struck
by how wonderful all of you are.
I'm just so glad that I married into this family.
I love you.
I love you, too.
You know we do have to tell everyone we're engaged.
Excuse me. Sorry. Aah!
What?
What?!
Surprise.
Group hug. Yes.
Oh, group hug! Group hug! Yes!
I don't want to make a video.
everybody. Be quiet. Come on. Be quiet.
I don't wanna talk about how I'm gonna miss everyone.
I would like to pretend
that this long, beautiful dream is gonna go on forever,
But nothing goes on forever.
We've been through so much --
Good things, horrible things.
I can't imagine what life is gonna be like tomorrow,
next week, next year.
just say it.
What?
I'm gonna miss you --
Really, really miss you.
Come on.
And I love you.
To have been here with all of you...
i think I might be the luckiest person in the whole world.
now, can I have a beer and some penis cake?
Power adapter, check.
American dollars, check.
Euros, check.
Maura, they have money, and atms.
Well, what if there's a power outage?
Well, then, the power adapter isn't gonna do you any good.
I set two alarms for tomorrow morning.
You don't need to.
My flight is at 8:00, and I need to be at the airport.
I told you I was gonna pick you up.
No, we've talked about this.
It's -- it's too emotional
for me to say goodbye to you at the airport.
I know.
What's that?
You used your miles and bought me a ticket to Paris.
Thank you!
You're coming to Paris?
Yes!
I checked with personnel.
I have eight weeks vacation, four weeks sick time,
And BPD only buys out eight weeks, so...
Well, what about the FBI?
I called them, and I asked if I could show up later,
And they said "Mais oui."
You speak French?
I know how to say, "Mais oui."
I can't believe it!
We are going to have a full month in France together.
I know!
We're gonna have so much fun!
I know!
You have to go home and pack.
No, my leopard bag is ready.
One bag?
Well, yeah. What?
Jeans, sweatpants, t-shirts, toothbrush.
Okay, you can't walk around the "City of lights"
in sweatpants and a t-shirt.
Watch me.
I'll have to rework the itinerary.
What? What?
We're gonna drink a bunch of wine,
Eat some smelly cheese... Mmm.
...I'll follow you around,
And we look at old French things.
Old French things?
And then drink more wine,
and the book'll write itself.
I'm not worried about it.
This is not how I pictured the next chapter starting.
Well, maybe that's the beauty of it.
I know!
You should just wear that the whole time.
I can't breathe.
Do you have any sweatpants?
You're going first-class?
Nope
Aren't you?
