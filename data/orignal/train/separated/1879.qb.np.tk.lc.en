we &apos;re trained to be vigilant ...
to chase down the problem ...

don &apos;t you feel bad , using a distraught mother
to help tutor you ?

i feel bad that i had to sit with you all night
so you wouldn &apos;t cry yourself to sleep over your sad preemie .
he has a brain bleed .
mm . no , he barely has a brain bleed .
look ... we expected it .
i &apos;m watching it .
oh , that &apos;s supposed to make me feel good ?
you are this close to failing your boards .

i know exactly what they &apos;ll ask that &apos;s gonna take you down .
is it robbins ?
i gotta go .
it &apos;s robbins . i &apos;m coming , too .
hey . have you seen derek ?
have you seen owen ?
he put me on his service . i told him not to ,
and he gives me an arachnoid cyst .
i have to pull the plug on a brain @-@ dead trauma .
i need owen to approve it .
there he is .
don &apos;t take too much .
that &apos;s my lunch . fine .
all right . thanks .
okay , bye .
so he &apos;s just sharing his nasty trail mix with someone .
i mean , people do that . it doesn &apos;t mean anything .
cristina .
what ?
i gotta go find derek .
okay .
okay , let &apos;s go over the game plan again .
if we see my mother ...
we &apos;re buried with work today .
and ... you &apos;re sorry , but jackson has no time
to spend with her , okay ?
there you are .
dr. avery .
oh , dr. sloan . how nice to see you again .
now move outta my way
so i can see my boy .
you look skinny .
tell me you did not forget your tux .
tux ?
jackson is my date
for the frontiers of medicine benefit tonight .
oh , this is dr. mara keaton .
mara is my star urology fellow .
mara , my son jackson .
dr. mark sloan .
it &apos;s a pleasure to meet you both .
pleasure to meet you .
mara &apos;s considering seattle grace
as an option for next year ,
and i thought , well , who better to show her around
than my son ?
dr. sloan , can you spare him for just a couple of hours ?
absolutely .
show her around . take your time .
i @-@ i can &apos;t possibly . we are ...
buried with work .
kepner can cover for you .
perfect .
perfect .
perfect .
so this is it ?
we do it now ?
unless , uh ...
do you need a minute to say something--
i &apos;ve said it .
he &apos;s been listening to me talk for 22 years .
i &apos;m sure he &apos;s grateful for a little peace and quiet .
what now ?
we &apos;ll turn off the ventilator .
his respirations will stop .
i &apos;ll disconnect his monitors and his feeding tube ...
and then--
he said this once ...
we were watching some dumb movie on tv ,
and this guy pulls the plug on another guy ...
and he--
he said , &quot; don &apos;t you dare do that to me . &quot;
he was joking . &quot; don &apos;t you do that to me .
you leave that plug in the wall ,
you put my organs in a jar . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t you give up on me . &quot;
stop . stop this . stop it . stop it .
stop . i c--i c-- i can &apos;t do this .
i can &apos;t do this .
turn--turn this back on .
turn it back on .
the husband withdrew consent , owen .
i had already turned off the vent when he said no .
he has medical p.o.a. he said stop . i stopped .
so what are you gonna do ?
i &apos;m going to get in on , uh , teddy &apos;s preemie surgery .
no , you &apos;re not .
you &apos;re gonna stay with him until he gives his consent again .
you want me to try and talk him into it ?
no , i want you to help him through it .
i want you to help him understand
that this is the only option left for his husband .
i want you to do your job and find some damn compassion .
do you need something ?
i just wonder if i could help .
no .
i &apos;ve--i &apos;ve been with these guys since michael first came in .
and we &apos;ve talked . they know me .
aren &apos;t you on nights now ?
well , i can hang around if it &apos;ll help .
well , i don &apos;t--i--
cristina ,
she can help , let her help .
thank you .
thanks .
so i &apos;m a week out of law school ...
first big interview ,
huge firm .
i &apos;ve never had a better interview .
so i stand up to shake hands ,
and i pass out--
right over the coffee table .
right over the coffee table
with my butt in the air .
and your skirt ...
my skirt rides up to my waist .
not even good panties . granny panties .
did you get the job ?
no .
well , your next interview will end much better
once we remove the cyst .
we &apos;re gonna perform what we call a marsupialization of the cyst .
we open up the wall of the cyst
so that it can drain freely
and then the fluid won &apos;t collect .
so your dizzy spells will stop .
but you said you found a tumor .
we did .
it &apos;s a small one . it &apos;s called a meningioma .
it &apos;s benign , so we &apos;re gonna leave it alone .
if it ever does cause a problem ,
it &apos;s easy enough to remove .
dr. grey could do it .
oh , go , girl .
but the cyst is in the temporal lobe .
that &apos;s what &apos;s causing the seizures and the dizziness .
we &apos;re gonna go after that .
so this is it ?
this is it .
we will see you when it is all over .
thank you .
ah , dr. grey . so glad you could join us .
i &apos;ve been kidnapped .
she misses me .
she &apos;s not even on neuro anymore .
well , she &apos;s thinking about coming back .
i &apos;m not .
she is . she &apos;s remembering the magic .
can he even take heart surgery ?
he has to . he has a pericardial tumor
compressing on his heart . he &apos;s decompensating .
he has a brain bleed .
shouldn &apos;t heart surgery wait till after it &apos;s cleared up ?
i wish we could , but it has to happen today .
so tommy &apos;s hip dysplasia can be treated with a harness .
and i brought you a scone since you skipped breakfast .
oh , thank you .
pumpkin . ew .
i &apos;ll take it .
eat that .
right . like i can eat .
you didn &apos;t eat all night .
you &apos;re gonna pass out .
just eat it .
when , uh , when are you going to do the surgery ?
as soon as he &apos;s prepped .
karev will let you know when we get started .
yeah , i &apos;m gonna scrub in , right ?
you just want him to have surgery
&apos;cause it &apos;ll look good for your boards .
i do not .
and also i do ,
but it &apos;s gonna be great for my boards .
look , he &apos;s gonna be fine , all right ?
he &apos;s not scrubbing in . he was up all night .
oh , shut up .
should karev really be hooking up
with the heart @-@ patient intern mom ? i mean--
what ? no , he &apos;s not .
he spent the night . he gave her a scone .
you gave me a scone .
yeah , i spend the night with you , too ,
because i &apos;m married to you .
no . no . she &apos;s his intern .
i mean , he &apos;s just--he &apos;s-- he &apos;s trying to--
to be nice , to care . you know .
i mean , alex karev is trying to be more human ,
and i think that we can thank me for that .
they &apos;re doing it .
they built you a beautiful bladder .
can i see it ?
oh , honey , no . you don &apos;t want to see that thing .
it &apos;s nasty .
picture a bread bowl
like your soup comes in ...
uh @-@ huh .
only this one is made out of meat .
oh ... please don &apos;t make me laugh .
i &apos;m gonna pee .
oh . oh , god . there i go .
oh , sweetheart . i &apos;m so sorry . ooh .
no , i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s all right . that should end today .
you won &apos;t have to be scared that your bladder will let go
every time you laugh .
or sneeze
or cough or have sex .
you &apos;re gonna have a very full life
when dr. avery &apos;s done with you .
i like to think that everybody lives a very full life
once i &apos;m done with them .
and there ...
we ...
are .
great .
that &apos;s a perfect craniotomy .
right , dr. grey ?
you dragged me back into neuro
to watch lexie do a boring procedure ?
hey , it is not boring .
it is not boring .
it &apos;s her first solo cyst .
be a big sister . cheer her on .
shepherd , i &apos;ve got a motorcycle cop
open on the table with a c @-@ 7 fracture .
i need your eyes on the cord . can you--
all right . i &apos;ll be right there .
okay .
when you , um , marsupialize that ,
make sure that you--
tack the edges . yes , i know .
she knows what she &apos;s doing .
just observe . i &apos;ll be right back .
if you need anything--
we won &apos;t . go .
and this is o.r. two ,
which looks exactly like o.r. one .
you still have to cover the e.r. in the fifth year ,
and study for your boards ?
yeah , it &apos;s a pretty rigorous program .
speaking of which , i need to be getting back to work , so--
do you mind if we watch for a second ?
of course .
god . i thought i had no time for a social life .
are you still dating anyone ?
am i still dating ?
i mean , are you dating anyone ?
tell me about you .
where &apos;d you go to school ?
well , my dad &apos;s the director of surgical science at oxford ,
so i did my preclinical years there .
oxford .
then residency at mass gen ,
then i transferred to the brigham
to study under your mother ,
and here i am .
that &apos;s quite a pedigree , isn &apos;t it ?
well , you know , a little hard work
and a lot of good timing .
no , i get it .
i totally get it .
is that derek shepherd ?
so there &apos;s cord damage .
do you mind if we stay and watch this for ...
just a few more sutures .
god , i have seen some tiny little hearts , but--
this is the tiniest .
his pressure &apos;s dropped . what happened ?
doctor , his fontanel is bulging and the pupils are dilated .
his i.v.h.
brain bleed .
give me the ultrasound .
here you go .
right there .
it &apos;s progressed to stage 3 .
he &apos;s gonna need a ventriculostomy fast ,
or we &apos;re looking at hydrocephalus .
and brain damage .
page marcus .
no , shepherd should take this .
no , he &apos;s in surgery .
just page marcus . he can handle it .
no , the kid &apos;s getting shepherd . just wait for me .
the cyst is draining really well .
really well .
great job .
where is that blood coming from ?
it &apos;s all right . it &apos;s just a little bleeding .
we just have to find the source .
let &apos;s extend the craniotomy a little .
open her up more ?
yeah . it &apos;s okay . just a little .
okay . here you go , doctor .
but i hear stories of people waking up all the time .
not this . not brain death .
but--but he &apos;s still breathing .
the machine is breathing for him .
when we shut it off--
he dies .
he--he &apos;s already--
your husband has died .
oh , good .
okay , this is an e.e.g.
uh , it &apos;s a brain scan of another patient in a coma ,
also ventilated .
these lines indicate brain activity .
um , you can see these spikes going all the way .
if you take a look at your husband &apos;s ,
it &apos;s completely flat .
we &apos;ve seen no brain activity for the past 72 hours--
just stop .
well , i &apos;m--i &apos;m just trying to explain--
explain to me
how you can tell me that he &apos;s dead
and then tell me to turn off life @-@ sustaining treatment .
explain that .
s--
sam , you can take your time .
this is a difficult decision .
you should just be with michael and take your time .
take all the time you need .
thank you .
it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s okay . i know how hard this is .
like that ?
uh @-@ huh .
there it is .
little bleeder . just cauterize .
okay . bipolar .
here you go .
there . okay .
look at that . that &apos;s her tumor .
what ?
oh , my god . there it is .
do we take it out ?
uh , we should , um ...
let &apos;s call o.r. two and find out
how long dr. shepherd &apos;s gonna be .
i mean , he said it would be easy .
that i @-@ i could do it .
i know , and it &apos;s right there .
they said he &apos;s just finishing .
he &apos;ll be here any minute .
okay . all right . well , let &apos;s just wait
and see what he says .
okay .
cord &apos;s clear . spine is stabilized .
what do you think ?
well , i think his motorcycle days are over .
hopefully , he &apos;ll be able to walk again .
dr. shepherd ,
we need you in o.r. four .
it &apos;s tommy . he &apos;s got a grade @-@ 3 bleed .
he needs a ventric placed .
karev , slow down .
who is tommy ?
uh , morgan &apos;s baby . the intern morgan .
all right . well , just give me a second , to , uh , finish--
can you come now ? please .
go . i &apos;ll finish .
okay .
where &apos;s your hot tourist ?
yeah , she &apos;s not here for a tour .
i &apos;m being set up .
my mom &apos;s trying to expand the avery dynasty .
you were supposed to tell her we were busy .
you and dr. hotness should be getting busy ,
if you get my point .
actually , she should be getting your point .
what are you , 12 ?
why are you so obsessed with me getting laid ?
&apos;cause it works for me .
it &apos;s called passing on wisdom .
also pimping .
she &apos;s here for one night .
no .
i am not going to give my mother the satisfaction .
it &apos;s not your mother you should be trying to satisfy .
child !
sam .
is there ...
do you have any questions i can answer ?
no , thank you .
if you could stop circling like a vulture ,
i &apos;d appreciate it .
do you want me to talk to him ?
no .
he just needs time to grieve , you know ,
to work through it .
he needs to think clearly .
he needs to understand what has happened .
he &apos;s losing his husband .
they were going to a grocery store ,
just living their nice , boring life ,
going to the same store they &apos;ve gone to for 22 years ,
and a car hits them .
sam never saw this coming .
like i said , i just-- i &apos;ve taken some time
to get to know them--
are you married ?
um , have you ever been married ?
no .
then stay out of it .
you have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
you don &apos;t know sam .
you don &apos;t know the first thing about what he needs .
there you are .
what are you doing here ?
we &apos;re finished . the cyst is draining .
she did great .
and get this-- lexie resected the meningioma--
perfect margins .
she was perfect .
you did what ?
took the tumor out .
why the hell would you do that ?
the plan was to remove the cyst .
she did not consent to that surgery .
the tumor was right there .
are we supposed to close her up
and put her through another brain surgery ?
you should &apos;ve paged me .
i did , twice . derek , lori is fine .
lexie took her to recovery . her vitals are great--
we won &apos;t know how she is until she wakes up .
i should &apos;ve known better .
you should &apos;ve known better . give me the scans .
i want to know everything that you did in there .
poor woman .
50 years old ,
and she has to wear adult diapers to go on a date .
kind of takes the magic out of ...
&quot; let me change into something
a little more comfortable . &quot;
you &apos;re terrible .
she probably saved herself some trouble .
by her age , all the good ones are already snapped up .
tragedy , isn &apos;t it ?
mm .
i &apos;m ready with this new bladder
if anybody &apos;s interested .
uh , yeah . bring it over here , dr. bailey .
dr. avery .
i seem to have lost track of the other dr. avery .
may i scrub in with you ?
no , you may not scrub in with me .
i gave you a job to do , dr. keaton .
but surely--
do you want to go to the benefit tonight or not ?
yes , ma &apos;am . of course .
good . you lost him . you go find him .
benefit ? hmm . sounds like fun .
fun ? it &apos;s exhausting .
once upon a time , i was catherine fox .
ever since i &apos;ve become an avery ,
every fund @-@ raiser , gala @-@ charity brouhaha
that comes along ,
i gotta squeeze into some pantyhose ,
get zipped into a couture gown and represent ,
and every time you go into an o.r. ,
they expect you to do
harper avery award @-@ winning work ,
even though i can never win a harper avery .
the name comes with way too much pressure .
you can crumble under it ,
burn out .
happened to jackson &apos;s father .
i do not want it to happen to jackson .
yeah , it &apos;s a--it &apos;s a lot to hold up .
don &apos;t you wish you could just go back sometimes ?
i would love to just be catherine fox all over again .
i was so much more fun back then .
oh , you &apos;re still fun now .
i am , huh ?
glad you noticed .
you try the cafeteria , too ?
jambalaya ?
disgusting . why do they even try ?
april &apos;s got , uh , yogurt .
and leftover something .
so lexie removed a tumor from a woman today ,
and now derek &apos;s all worried that we gorked her .
mm . did you ?
no .
well , i &apos;ve spent the entire morning
with owen &apos;s stupid nurse .
owen &apos;s nurse .
the stupid i.c.u. nurse .
well , that &apos;s not what you said .
oh , and you know what ? this is really good .
kepner can cook .
freakin &apos; jambalaya day .
it &apos;s like a hearty bowl of salmonella .
hey , how long have you been screwing the intern
with the preemie ?
what ?
morgan ?
i am not .
uh , well , you both were in the on @-@ call room this morning ...
before dawn .
yeah , studying .
you &apos;re feeding her .
alex .
no . bad dog .
shut up . i mean , she &apos;s ... my intern .
and she &apos;s a patient .
this is gonna turn out like rebecca .
oh , yeah . smashed @-@ up face ?
oh , that ... that was bad .
yeah , she &apos;s gonna fall for you ,
and then she &apos;s gonna go crazy
and then she &apos;s gonna pee on my couch .
oh , gross .
go to hell , the both of you .
okay , just keep her off my couch , please .
are things with owen any better ?
is that my turkey casserole ?
oh , yeah .
how do you keep the crunchy onion things so crunchy ?
i put them in last .
come on . i looked forward to this all day .
delicious .
stop facebooking my mom , all right ?
uh , i &apos;m not .
really ? then how does she know i broke up with lexie , hmm ?
why is she here trying to hook me up
with some junior urologist ?
hey .
hey , those are mine . they have electrolytes .
i showed her around half the damn hospital
before i realized i was on a blind date .
you told me to unfriend her . i did .
hi . i &apos;m looking for dr. avery .
oh , yes . he &apos;s right there .
oh . there you are .
yeah .
shall we continue ?
let &apos;s do that .
that &apos;s great .
cristina ?
drop it .
we were talking .
no , you were talking . i said drop it .
i &apos;m fine .
everything is fine , really .
i thought we could check out your cafeteria ,
get a bite to eat , talk .
listen , dr. keaton .
mara .
yeah , you &apos;re very nice , okay ?
but i am not really interested .
i &apos;m not sure what you mean .
obviously my mom thought there might be
some kind of connection or something here .
but i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m just not looking for ...
a hookup ?
or whatever .
i see .
you think i &apos;m being served to you
like a concubine ?
no , i didn &apos;t ...
i &apos;m not here to service you , dr. avery .
i &apos;m here to serve your mother for a grade .
and she has tasked me with digging up as much as i can
about your boards , your standing , your love life .
and when you &apos;re gonna stop screwing around in plastics .
you &apos;re not a setup . you &apos;re a spy .
i rank this task slightly above wiping vomit from bedpans .
but your mother is a very demanding woman ,
and if you know anything about her ,
you know i can &apos;t go back empty @-@ handed .
so if you &apos;re really sorry
and not just a presumptuous pig ,
you would do a girl a solid , and you will tell me
whatever it is you want me to tell her .
and you can do it in the cafeteria ,
because i &apos;m bloody starving !
not a chance . it &apos;s jambalaya day .
come with me .
where is lexie ?
i told her to go wait for the labs .
it &apos;s going to be fine .
oh , god , honey .
we &apos;re lori &apos;s parents .
we were in rome . we just got here .
i &apos;m dr. shepherd . this is dr. grey .
how is she ?
lori &apos;s surgery went very well .
her vitals are excellent .
we won &apos;t know more until she comes out of the anesthesia .
oh , she &apos;s starting to come around .
hey , lori . how are you doing ?
hmm ? let me look at you , okay ?
well , responses are good . follow this for me . up .
down .
how you feelin &apos; ?
honey , we &apos;re right here .
oh , that &apos;s a good sign .
hi , sweetheart .
it &apos;s called aphasia .
the part of the brain that helps control
how she forms words was damaged in the surgery .
there is a chance , with therapy ,
that she will regain some of her function .
some ?
what the hell did you do to her ?
mr. bosson ...
i am sorry . i ...
i had the best intentions .
it was an outcome that i did not foresee .
i &apos;m sorry . i made a mistake .
we &apos;re suing you .
she &apos;s 27 years old . you ruined her life .
honey , honey--
we are going to sue you .
honey , stop . lori can hear you .
it was my mistake . you weren &apos;t even in the room .
my mistake was leaving you two in there alone .
i can &apos;t believe you would do this .
i thought , if you had seen the tumor--
you didn &apos;t think at all .
okay , it &apos;s my fault . let &apos;s just let it be my fault .
this will kill lexie .
it &apos;ll destroy her confidence .
does she even have to know ?
of course she does .
she &apos;s not strong enough .
then she shouldn &apos;t be a surgeon .
hey , did she wake up yet ?
i am telling you ,
dr. webber was amazing .
he cradled your bladder in those big ol &apos; hands
like it was his own little baby .
oh , my god . stop it .
and i said to him , i said , &quot; you got a fat , ugly baby . &quot;
stop . i &apos;m gonna pee .
ooh , wait . mm .
i &apos;m not gonna pee ?
no , baby . you are not going to pee .
i &apos;m not gonna pee !
oh , okay .
wait , wait , wait .
oh . here we go . okay .
satisfied customer .
ah . we are quite a team , aren &apos;t we ?
hey .
you know what would make this thing fun tonight ?
if you came with me .
i &apos;ve got jackson coming ,
but i &apos;d much prefer a grown @-@ up along .
i @-@ i wish i could .
i @-@ i mean , i really do , but ...
you know what ?
i &apos;d be honored to join you .
yes . okay .
can you get a tux ?
sure .
oh , this is gonna be so much fun .
you have to stop
thinking of this as giving up on michael
and try to see it as helping him .
emily .
it &apos;s a hard step .
but it is his next step ,
and he really needs you right now .
how can i do this when he said not to do it ? how ?
it would &apos;ve been better if he died in the crash .
he &apos;d be just as dead ,
but you wouldn &apos;t be feeling like this .
this way ...
he &apos;s died in slow motion .
on monday , his heart ruptured ,
and i repaired it .
but on tuesday , his lungs collapsed .
by thursday , his kidneys failed ,
and the sepsis and infection
took three more days to kill his brain .
sam ...
if he had died in the crash by the side of the road ,
if you had seen him zipped up in a bag
and driven off ,
he would be every bit as gone as he is right now ,
but you would know it .
and you could take some comfort in that .

to tell you that i loved you
and another three years before i moved in with you .

i was scared of this--
scared of how much i loved you ,
scared of the feeling
that i &apos;d never be able to find happiness without you .

you stick to your surgical plan .
you find a tumor , you find anything ...
you close up , and you make a plan for that .
i know . i @-@ i @-@ i know that .
do you ?
do you ? because if you had taken the time to look ,
you would have opted to approach the tumor from this angle ...
and lori would be speaking right now !
it &apos;s just stupid--
a stupid , arrogant mistake .
you stick to your-- you stick to your surgical plan .
you make an incidental finding ...
don &apos;t you look fine ?
mom , mara has something to say .
i ...
i don &apos;t really .
sure you do .
dr. avery and i have decided
we won &apos;t be joining you tonight .
oh ?
unless , of course , you really want me to , and--
guns .
since you brought me across the country
to run a personal errand for you
when i could &apos;ve been
gaining valuable surgical experience ...
there you go .
i &apos;ve decided to take the night off .
i &apos;m going to do what i want to do with my time
and you can just--
you want to stop right there .
yeah , you &apos;re done .
so you captured my spy .
she will be very well treated .

i &apos;m sorry , catherine . i can &apos;t go .
is this because i &apos;ve been flirting with you all day ?
no . no .
oh , come on , richard . you know i &apos;m just having fun .
your wife has nothing to worry about .
my wife has alzheimer &apos;s .
how bad ?
it &apos;s bad .
she &apos;s in a care facility .
i go see her every night .
she usually doesn &apos;t know who i am .
she knows i &apos;m a friend , but ...
she &apos;s not there .
and i miss her . i miss ...
laughing and talking .
i miss feeling like a man ,
not just a friend .
anyway , today ,
i wasn &apos;t lonely .
today i felt like a man .
and it felt good .
so ...
i don &apos;t trust myself going to dinner with you tonight
and my wife needs me .
and i need to see my wife .
richard ,
you are ...
a good man .
you know that ?
i &apos;m trying .
thank you ...
for a lovely day .
you sure you want to change ?
we could go somewhere nice ,
somewhere where you could look that amazing .
actually ,
i &apos;m really not that hungry .
no ?
could you help me with my zipper ?
can you help me a little bit more ?
our intentions are always pure .
we always want to do what &apos;s right .
but we also have the drive to push boundaries .
so we &apos;re in danger of taking things too far .
we &apos;re told to &quot; do no harm &quot;
while we &apos;re trained to cut you open with a knife .
are you okay ?
no .
are you thinking about lori ?
this is why i can &apos;t come back to neuro .
you can &apos;t even look at me .
it &apos;s no good for us .
i know .
you want to talk about it ?
no .
do you want to take your mind off it ?
no .
do you want me to leave you alone ?
no .
so ...
we do things ...
when we should have left well enough alone .
because it &apos;s hard to admit when there &apos;s no problem to treat ...
you &apos;re awake .
you didn &apos;t come home .
yeah , there was a--
a bus crash or a train crash
or a patient crashed ?
yeah . right .
to let it alone ...
why are you staring at me ?
well , i &apos;m weighing how upset you are
and if i want to get into this .
you do . you want to get into this ... with me .
i &apos;m tired and it &apos;s late .
you know what ? that &apos;s the point .
it &apos;s always late , and it shouldn &apos;t be .
and you should want to get into it with me
but you don &apos;t .
i mean , where are you ?
i am--i am here .
for god sake .
i &apos;m right freakin &apos; here . i &apos;m home .
no , you &apos;re not .
before we make it so much worse ...
before we cause such terrible damage .
you have to beonest with me
because i am going crazy here .
do you , um , do you love me anymore ?
it &apos;s not about if i--
owen , please answer the question .
i love you so much that it hurts .
okay .
well , okay , then . then we can--
we can work on this . we can talk .
you know , we-- we have to talk ,
because i cannot be like this anymore .
and i mean it when i say that i &apos;m going crazy ,
&apos;cause ...
&apos;cause that nurse emily--
i mean , i @-@ i accused her of sleeping with you .
you what ?
i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry . i just-- i mean , i feel like ...
my whole body feels like ...
like you were cheating on me .
and then you come home and you tell me that you love me ,
and i &apos;m ... i &apos;m--i &apos;m--i &apos;m relieved .
i mean , i &apos;m so relieved because--
stop . stop .
i said i love you so much that it hurts .
okay .
i said ...
it hurts ...
to love you .
just say it .
i &apos;m not cheating on you with emily .
okay .
