oh , hey , we ran into your mom at benihana last night .
uh , yeah , she loves that place .
every time they flip a shrimp in the air ,
she practically leaps out of her seat to catch it .
that &apos;s why i don &apos;t take her to the seaworld .
i know you don &apos;t want to hear it ,
but she was there with stuart .
that &apos;s fine . i don &apos;t care .
it doesn &apos;t bug you when they go out on dates ?
they &apos;re not dating .
they &apos;re just two friends who went out to dinner .
and then went back to the home they share
where they probably fell asleep
in the matching pajamas she got them
because they both just love penguins .
hey , lots of people wear matching pajamas who aren &apos;t dating .
like who ?
like you and your dog .
don &apos;t rule out the dating .
fine , it bothers me .
you happy ?
you think you &apos;ve got problems .
the gibbon is the only member of the ape family
not classified as a great ape .
how is this helpful ?
all the non @-@ human apes are classified
as great apes except one .
that means
taxonomists created the entire category of lesser ape
just to single out the poor gibbon
as the weird kid on the playground .
now there &apos;s a hairy little fellow with a genuine beef .
but the gibbon doesn &apos;t know what it &apos;s categorized as .
it doesn &apos;t even know it &apos;s called a gibbon .
true .
sorry , kid , you &apos;ve got it worse than a gibbon .
we brought snacks for movie night .
oh , great .
i don &apos;t suppose you also brought napkins , clean bowls ,
utensils and a roll of toilet paper .
right here .
you guys are the best .
what &apos;s with the clothes ?
well , with all the new stuff i bought for work ,
i needed to make room in my closet .
i meant why are they folded ?
but whatever .
ooh , what &apos;s this ?
that , believe it or not , is my prom dress .
wow , you still have it ?
i just assumed it was balled up
in the corner of a barn somewhere .
what kind of teenager did you think i was ?
slutty .
easy .
the word is &quot; popular . &quot;
how was your prom ? did you go ?
no , but i was on clean @-@ up crew .
aw , that &apos;s sad .
no , it was okay .
the dj let me dance one slow song with my mop
before he shut down .
whenever i see a bucket of dirty water ,
i still hear &quot; lady in red . &quot;
my prom was pretty terrible , too .
i was so excited about my date ,
but it turned out he only asked me
&apos;cause he liked my friend .
he spent the whole night talking about her .
okay , we get it , you had a friend and a date .
stop bragging .
doesn &apos;t matter .
prom is silly anyways .
easy for you to say ;
you probably went with the captain of the football team .
no .
i just made out with him a little
while his date was puking .
my date would &apos;ve had to clean that up .
ooh , i have an idea .
maybe we can have , like , a prom do @-@ over .
oh , that would be so much fun .
we could decorate the roof and make the guys wear tuxedos .
ooh , and get our hair done , and slow @-@ dance .
okay , guys , trust me ,
as someone who &apos;s been to , like , seven proms ,
it is never as good as you want it to be .
you went to seven proms ?
yeah , let &apos;s see .
uh , four &quot; under the seas , &quot; two &quot; enchanted evenings , &quot;
and one &quot; night to remember &quot;
that ... i cannot remember for the life of me .
hey , where &apos;s bernadette ?
she and amy are out dress shopping for their prom thing .
oh , yeah , i got that evite .
ever since i saw pretty in pink ,
片中有毕业舞会桥段
i &apos;ve wanted to go to an american prom .
but then i saw carrie ,
and i did not want to go to an american prom .
but then i saw never been kissed ,
and i &apos;m back on the prom bandwagon .
this prom thing &apos;s been a real roller coaster .
bernie &apos;s really excited .
i @-@ i could tell because her voice got so high ,
the beagle next door started howling .
did you go to your prom ?
no .
i had a date with a proper education .
instead of a tuxedo , i dressed myself in good habits .
instead of spiked punch ,
i enjoyed the intoxicating flavor of knowledge .
instead of dancing in a gym ,
i shook my booty to the seductive rhythms ...
okay , okay .
... of ap calculus .
how come you &apos;re not shopping with amy and bernadette ?
let me guess , you think the whole idea is lame ?
well , who cares what i think ? what do you think ?
hmm , to be honest ,
it &apos;s kind of a dream come true to go to even a fake prom
with a woman as beautiful as you .
ugh , thanks a lot .
what ?
well , now i can &apos;t blow this thing off without being a bitch .
that sounds like a &quot; yes &quot; !
ooh , every single person rsvp &apos;d &quot; yes . &quot;
this is so exciting !
isn &apos;t this exciting ?
yep .
look , even stuart &apos;s bringing a date .
i wonder who it is .
you know exactly who it is .
he &apos;s gonna bring my mom .
why did you even invite him ?
because he &apos;s our friend , and you two need to get along .
and why can &apos;t he take your mom ?
you took her to your prom .
i didn &apos;t &quot; take &quot; her ; she was a chaperone .
i saw a picture of you two dancing together .
w @-@ what was i gonna do ?
they were playing our song !
i can &apos;t take this anymore .
hello .
stuart , we have to talk .
this thing with you and my mom ,
i @-@ i hate it .
it &apos;s making me crazy .
you and i were friends for years ,
and now you &apos;re bringing my mother to a party
i &apos;m going to ? !
what the hell ? !
i &apos;m not bringing your mother , i have a date .
oh , so now you &apos;re cheating on my mother ?
wha @-@ what are you talking about ?
there &apos;s nothing weird going on with me and your mother .
stewie , your bath is getting cold !
i got to go , bye .
penny ?
penny .
penny .
penny .
penny .
you knocked more than usual .
next time i might be in a rush ,
it &apos;s good to have a few in the bank .
okay , what &apos;s up ?
i &apos;d like to discuss this party
that amy and bernadette are throwing .
since you and i are both reluctant to go ,
i think i &apos;ve come up with a perfect way for us to enjoy it .
great , how ?
we pretend we &apos;re aliens .
i &apos;m not the best at reading facial cues ,
but i &apos;m gonna say that you love it and want to hear more .
now , in the beloved novel
hitchhiker &apos;s guide to the galaxy ,
an alien named ford prefect pretended to be human
in order to blend in
so that he could write an entry about earth
for the hitchhiker &apos;s guide to the galaxy ,
which is a travel book within the actual book ,
which is also called
the hitchhiker &apos;s guide to the galaxy .
okay , just one question .
what ?
my point is , pretending to be an alien is
a valuable coping mechanism i &apos;ve used many times .
i did it the first time i went to see you in a play .
you had no idea commander umfrumf
of ceti alpha three was in the audience .
oh , d @-@ don &apos;t worry , he gave you seven thumbs up .
here &apos;s a question--
as an alien pretending to be human ,
are you planning to engage in any
post @-@ prom mating rituals with amy ?
there are post @-@ prom mating rituals ?
not always .
unless your date drives a van with an air mattress ,
then always .
well , if it &apos;s part of the prom experience , then i &apos;m open to it .
you &apos;re kidding .
i may be an alien , but i have urges .
if amy wants to copulate by firing her eggs into space ,
well , then , i will happily catch them
with the reproductive sac on my upper flermin .
i &apos;m not the best at reading facial cues ,
but i can see that you &apos;re a little turned on .
you know , if you &apos;re not gonna learn how to do this ,
they make some pretty good clip @-@ ons .
bruce wayne doesn &apos;t wear a clip @-@ on .
bruce wayne doesn &apos;t make his roommate tie it for him .
his name is alfred , and , yes , he does .
there , perfect .
what , are you sure ?
it &apos;s my first prom , i want to do it correctly .
i thought you were gonna pretend to be an alien .
i was , but penny didn &apos;t want to .
you didn &apos;t want to .
bernadette , amy ,
koothrappali and wolowitz didn &apos;t want to .
and even i knew it was weird to hire somebody .
was that a flask ?
yes .
i &apos;ve decided to embrace all of the traditions
associated with prom , including spiking the punch .
you &apos;re gonna put alcohol in the punch ?
oh , no , this is pomegranate juice .
it &apos;s all the fun of high school high jinks
with the cell @-@ protecting zip of antioxidants .
if you had ripped jeans and a leather jacket ,
you &apos;d be like the toughest kid on the disney channel .
so , anything else planned for tonight ?
oh , everything .
getting our picture taken , slow @-@ dancing ,
being elected prom king .
pointing out that kings aren &apos;t elected .
it &apos;s gonna be off the hook .
and while you &apos;re at it ,
i know that at this age your hormones are raging ,
but just because all your friends are having sex
doesn &apos;t mean you have to .
why would you say that ?
you know , &apos; cause ...
&apos;cause a lot of people lose their virginity on prom night .
penny implied the same thing .
is this true ?
just relax , it &apos;s a joke .
you don &apos;t have hormones .
wow , you look amazing .
thank you , so do you .
sheldon , you look so handsome .
thank you .
sheldon , doesn &apos;t amy look hot ?
that &apos;s got to put some starch in the upper flermin .
what &apos;s that ?
oh , it &apos;s a scaly genital organ
that grows between his shoulder blades .
try not to touch it when you &apos;re dancing .
excuse me .
where are you going ?
i can &apos;t do this .
and for your information , leonard ,
the upper flermin doesn &apos;t grow between my shoulder blades ,
it grows out of the belly button on my neck .
he &apos;s right , i was thinking of the lower flermin .
ooh , i &apos;ll , uh , text stuart , let him know we &apos;re close .
that &apos;s a neat tattoo .
oh , thanks , it &apos;s sally from nightmare before christmas .
aw , that movie &apos;s so cute .
do you like her because you both have red hair ?
uh , a little , but more that she &apos;s covered in scars
and can pull her own limbs off and sew them back on .
i like cinderella .
did you know , in the original book ,
the sisters cut off their toes with knives
in order to fit in the glass slipper ?
i like &quot; bibbidi @-@ bobbidi @-@ boo . &quot;
hey , here comes stuart and his date .
oh , she &apos;s cute .
oh , my god .
what ?
that &apos;s jeanie .
that &apos;s jeanie ? !
who &apos;s jeanie ?
don &apos;t say it .
that &apos;s howard &apos;s cousin that he had sex with .
she is my second cousin .
we were 15 ... i just said , &quot; don &apos;t say it . &quot;
no , it &apos;s okay .
he told me that story a long time ago .
raj !
it was our first date ,
there was an awkward silence .
what was i supposed to say ?
oh , it &apos;s beautiful .
oh , the girls really did a nice job .
i know i wasn &apos;t into this before ,
but i &apos;m so glad i get to take you to your first prom .
what makes you think i didn &apos;t go to my prom ?
i went .
well , who &apos;d you go with ?
i took a little lady i like to call loneliness .
aw , it &apos;s all right .
we ended up having a threesome
with her friend humiliation , so ...
well , if i would have been there and saw you alone ,
i would &apos;ve asked you to dance .
no , you wouldn &apos;t have .
well , you don &apos;t know that .
it was before my growth spurt .
what , that already happened ?
very funny .
well , you wouldn &apos;t have asked me either .
i would have asked you .
in my head .
on the way home .
while i was having a good cry .
sheldon , can i come in ?
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea .
why not ?
according to an online message board ,
i may be having a panic attack .
soccermom09 had similar symptoms .
but to be fair , the twins were a real handful that day .
you &apos;re making me worry .
what &apos;s going on ?
what &apos;s going on is we &apos;re about to go to a prom .
and there &apos;s a great deal of pressure
on young couples like us to engage in
what mr. bob eubanks called making whoopee .
what pressure ?
all i said was you look handsome .
can you please open the door ?
it &apos;s not just that .
leonard and penny also made comments about it .
and i &apos;m not blind .
even i looked twice when i saw my posterior
in these tuxedo pants .
so , i met jeanie at your aunt gladys &apos; .
she passed me the manischewitz ,
i took one look at this punim ,
and i almost plotzed on the kugel .
is this what i sound like when i talk about india ?
so , my mother &apos;s okay with this ?
why would your mother have a problem with me and stuart ?
&apos;cause they have a weird , inappropriate relationship .
weirder than what you and i did in my dad &apos;s corolla ?
this is so messed up .
i know , i &apos;m having the best time .
why would you even come to this ?
didn &apos;t you know i &apos;d be here ?
it was a long time ago , howard .
and you &apos;re only second cousins , who cares ?
so , you knew and you brought her anyway ?
oh , so she &apos;s good enough for howard , but not for me ? !
yeah .
yeah , go have weird relationships
with your own mother and cousin .
this is his turf .
yeah .
well , i might not have asked you to dance then ,
but i will ask you now .
there &apos;s no music .
i don &apos;t care .
we &apos;ll make our own music .
my god , who &apos;s the dork now ?
thank you for wearing your flats .
thank you for wearing your heels .
look at me .
dancing with the prettiest girl at the prom .
want to take a picture of us and send it
to your old friends in the chess club ?
i sent them a bikini shot of you years ago .
this is nice .
i kind of wish no one else was coming .
i know , me , too .
but it will be fun to have a prom without all the drama .
howie , get off of him !
not until he stops humping his way up my family tree !
sheldon , this is silly .
i &apos;m not missing another prom .
i &apos;m going upstairs now .
good @-@ bye .
i really did think you looked pretty .
you did ?
yes .
so much so that i started to panic .
well , you can relax .
just because you think i look pretty
doesn &apos;t mean we have to spend the night together .
were you hoping we would because it &apos;s prom ?
i &apos;m always hoping .
but tonight i just wanted to have a nice time with you .
and maybe dance with someone who has arms .
thank you for understanding .
of course i understand .
sheldon ,
there &apos;s something else i &apos;ve been wanting to say ,
but before i do , i just ...
i want you to know that you don &apos;t have to say it back .
i know you &apos;re not ready ,
and i don &apos;t want you to say it
just because social convention dictates ...
i love you , too .
you said it .
there &apos;s no denying i have feelings for you
that can &apos;t be explained in any other way .
i briefly considered that i had a brain parasite .
but that seems even more farfetched .
the only conclusion was love .
i know what &apos;s happening .
this is a panic attack .
soccermom09 says to lie down with your feet elevated .
okay .
just because i love you doesn &apos;t mean
girls are allowed in my room .
okay .
here we go ...
say &quot; cheese &quot; !
say &quot; cheese &quot; !
say &quot; cousin &quot; !
say ...
oh , sorry .
hang on , sorry .
hey , debbie .
i ... yeah , yeah , i &apos;m here with jeanie .
okay , but we &apos;re just friends .
it &apos;s ... yeah .
i got to go .
