hello .
hello .
i love my new job !
honey , you &apos;re screaming .
you bet your ass i am !
i just had the best first day ever !
the kitchen ? twice as big as allessandro &apos;s .
oh , that &apos;s great .
and clean ? not just health department @-@ clean , monica @-@ clean !
awesome .
oh , and the people are so nice .
there &apos;s this one guy , jeffrey , he &apos;s the maitre d &apos; .
chandler , you will love him !
he is without a doubt the funniest guy i have ever met !
the.one.with.the.male.nanny
this is nice .
i know .
you need both hands for that ?
yeah , i kind of do .
well , how &apos;s this ?
are you sure that &apos;s sweet enough ?
look at you two holding hands .
is this getting serious ?
have you not talked about it yet ?
am i making you uncomfortable ?
if you were bigger you &apos;d hit me .
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s obviously way too early for us to be having that conversation .
is it ?
maybe not . is it ?
when i got divorced ..
i didn &apos;t think i &apos;d feel this way about someone for a really long time .
then again , i didn &apos;t think i &apos;d meet someone like you . and ..
this may be crazy @-@ soon , but i want you to have this .
no , not .. that &apos;s gum .
oh , five bucks ! i love it when that happens , you know ?
you don &apos;t know it &apos;s there ..
i know . keep digging .
sorry .
it &apos;s a key .
to be honest , i think i &apos;d prefer the five dollars .
it &apos;s to my apartment .
wow !
big step for phoebe and mike .
i don &apos;t want you to feel like you have to give me your key ..
no , i want to .
thank god .
wow . i was starting to think i &apos;d never meet someone that ..
i wanted to do this with .
here you go .
this is cool .
it really is .
i know it . it is amazing . these little things open doors !
so i don &apos;t go back to work for another four weeks ..
but we would like our nanny to start right away ..
so that emma could get a chance to know her .
i think that &apos;s really smart .
the easier we can make the transition for her the better .
that &apos;s great . great .
so do you have any questions for us ?
not really .
all right . well , thank you so much for coming .
thank you .
it was really nice to meet you .
we will call you .
oh , you know , wait .
i do have one question .
do you guys do random drug testing ?
boy , we hadn &apos;t really thought of that .
that &apos;s cool . but if you do , i &apos;m gonna need three days &apos; notice .
okey @-@ dokey !
we &apos;re never gonna find a nanny .
come on , rach . we will . i promise . we have more interviews .
worse comes to worst , we can always reconsider the first one we met with .
what , the blond with no bra ?
she was blond ?
just a sec .
okay , this one &apos;s name is sandy .
she &apos;s got a degree in early childhood education .
she worked for her last family for three years .
hi . i &apos;m sandy .
freddie prinze jr .
and she &apos;s a little mannish .
oh , my god ! david !
is this a bad time ?
no , it &apos;s a great time ! come in !
wow ! hi !
oh , my gosh ! what are you doing here ? are you back from minsk ?
just for a couple of days .
i &apos;m here to explain to the people who gave us our grant ..
why it &apos;s a positive thing that we &apos;ve spent all their money ..
and accomplished nothing .
who cares ? it got you here .
it got me to new york . then i got in a cab at the airport ..
and the guy said , &quot; where to ? &quot;
i just gave him your address . i didn &apos;t even think about it .
where &apos;s your luggage ?
damn it .
all right , i &apos;ll call the cab company .
we can call them later . can you just stand there for a moment ?
boy .
there &apos;s an old russian expression that goes :
roughly translated , that means :
&quot; this thing that i &apos;m looking at : wow . &quot;
thank you .
you should see me when .. actually , no , i look pretty good .
are you kidding ?
you know , when you don &apos;t see someone for a long time ..
you build them up in your head , you start thinking :
&quot; come on , don &apos;t be crazy , nobody &apos;s that beautiful . &quot;
but , well , you are .
well , so are you seeing anyone ?
no .
i &apos;m just the worst person ever !
how can i not tell david that i &apos;m seeing mike ?
maybe he didn &apos;t give you a chance .
he said , &quot; are you seeing someone ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
well , that would &apos;ve been your window .
i mean , i don &apos;t know . i was looking in his eyes ..
and i was just thinking , &quot; oh , my god , it &apos;s david . david &apos;s here . &quot;
he &apos;s so irresistible .
really ? the scientist guy ?
really ? chandler ?
continue .
then it gets worse ..
because i told him i would see him tomorrow night .
phoebe !
i know ! evil !
i like mike so much , you know ? it &apos;s just going really well . oh , my god !
isn &apos;t it ironic that david would show up ..
on the same day that you and mike exchange keys ?
yeah . you know , and given my lifelong search for irony ..
you can imagine how happy i am !
what are you gonna do ?
i mean , i guess i just have to ..
tell david that nothing can happen between us .
unless i don &apos;t .
you know , complicated moral situation ?
no right , no wrong ?
you have to tell david .
i knew i should &apos;ve had this conversation with joey .
funniest guy she &apos;s ever met .
i &apos;m funny , right ?
what do you know ? you &apos;re a door .
you just like knock @-@ knock jokes .
save it for inside .
so oklahoma &apos;s a crazy place . you know , they call it the sooner state .
frankly , i &apos;d sooner be in any other state !
and what &apos;s with oklahoma having a panhandle ?
can all states have stuff like that ?
hey , yeah , i &apos;m from the waistband of wyoming .
but when i was 7 , we headed over to the crotch .
was your cabin pressurized ?
and don &apos;t get me started on the way the people from tulsa talk .
okay .
what &apos;s with the word &quot; y &apos;all &quot; ? you know , just two words just pushed together ?
are we all allowed to do that ? because if so , i say why stop there ?
you know , your new poodle could be your noodle .
and fried chicken could be fricken .
waiter ? waiter , excuse me , i &apos;ll have the fricken !
see , that &apos;s funny with the fricken , right ?
no , it just reminds me of something this guy did today at work .
i told you about that funny guy , jeffrey , right ?
yeah , he came up .
well , he did this bit . you probably had to be there ..
but it was liza minnelli locked in our freezer eating a raw chicken .
were you there ?
no , but it sounds fricken funny .
i really understand how hard it &apos;s gotta be to leave your child with another person .
i mean , it &apos;s like leaving behind a piece of your heart .
sandy , that &apos;s exactly what it is .
are you gay ?
i &apos;m sorry , that &apos;s our ross . he &apos;s just mr. shoot straight from the hip .
it &apos;s okay . i get that a lot doing what i do .
but i am straight . i &apos;m engaged , actually .
her name &apos;s delia .
that &apos;s pretty .
so you &apos;re just , like , a guy who &apos;s a nanny .
i realize how it &apos;s a bit unorthodox for some people .
but i really believe the most satisfying thing you can do with your life ..
is take care of a child .
okay .
like at my last job .
i met daniel when he was 3 weeks old .
and i got to watch him grow into this awesome person .
when i left , i said , &quot; i &apos;ll see you soon . &quot;
and he said to me , &quot; skadandy ? &quot;
that was his name for me .
&quot; i &apos;ll see you every day right in .. &quot;
it &apos;s okay .
yeah , kids say all kinds of crap .
oh , god , she must need her diaper changed .
i can take care of that , if you want .
that would be great .
just so you know , these dinosaur toys aren &apos;t really age @-@ appropriate .
they &apos;re mine .
also not age @-@ appropriate .
i love him , i love him , i love him !
come on . rach , he &apos;s a guy !
so what ? he &apos;s smart . he &apos;s qualified .
give me one good reason we shouldn &apos;t try him out .
because it &apos;s weird !
why ?
wow , i never looked at it that way .
what kind of a job is that for a man ? a nanny ?
i mean , it &apos;s like if a woman wanted to be ..
yes ?
king ?
i hope you don &apos;t mind . i used some of my homemade lotion on emma .
it &apos;s a mixture of calendula and honey cream . it &apos;ll dry that rash right up .
plus , it keeps the hands young .
yes ! sandy , you &apos;re hired !
that &apos;s great !
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s just such an emotional thing when you &apos;re welcomed into a new family .
oh , god . come here .
you gotta be at least bi .
i need you to set me up for a joke .
when monica &apos;s around , ask me about fire trucks .
i don &apos;t know , chandler . i &apos;m not so good with remembering lines .
thank god your livelihood doesn &apos;t depend on it .
i know , right ?
why are we doing this ?
monica says that her maitre d &apos; is the funniest guy she &apos;s ever met .
seriously ? she actually said that ?
yes . am i crazy to be this upset ?
no ! being funny &apos;s your thing !
yeah !
without that , you just got &quot; lame with women &quot; !
hi ! there you are .
fire trucks !
hi .
hi .
i brought you this from minsk .
you &apos;re not gonna belief this . this is lemon @-@ flavored vodka .
yeah , we actually have this here .
i traded four pairs of levi &apos;s for that .
thanks anyway .
wow . you look even more beautiful than you did yesterday .
in fact , i &apos;m going to kiss you now .
wait , wait .
i can &apos;t get away with stuff like that .
it sounded sexy in my head , so i ..
no , no , it &apos;s not that .
remember when you asked me if i was seeing someone and i said no ?
well , i am . his name &apos;s mike .
i should &apos;ve told you .
no .
well , yeah .
i &apos;m sorry . i wanted to tell you , but then i just got lost in your eyes ..
and i just forgot all about ..
mike ?
right , yes .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry .
well , it &apos;s okay . i understand .
well , are you happy with this guy ?
i am happy .
damn it .
i &apos;m sorry . i don &apos;t mean that . i want you to be happy .
but only with me . no , that &apos;s not fair . who cares . leave him .
i don &apos;t mean that . yes , i do . i &apos;m sorry .
i think i should probably go .
but , david , i just want you to know that , you know ..
telling you this is one of the hardest things i &apos;ve ever had to do .
well , just so you know ..
hearing it wasn &apos;t exactly a vladnik carnival , either .
can we at least hug goodbye ?
of course . yeah .
you know , and a kiss on the cheek wouldn &apos;t be totally inappropriate .
no . no .
i mean ..
in minsk ?
yeah ?
it &apos;s two on each cheek ..
and one on the lips .
well , if that &apos;s what they do in minsk .
in new york , it &apos;s ..
oh , boy .
is everything all right ?
oh , yeah . no , it &apos;s fine . it &apos;s fine .
sandy was just telling me about how he proposed to his fiancee ..
and it was so beautiful .
her favorite flower is the camellia . from the poem ..
i can &apos;t hear it again !
you know , i can &apos;t tell it again !
and i &apos;m fine never having heard it .
rach , can i see you for a sec ?
yeah . excuse me .
do you realize that man has cried in our apartment three times ?
i haven &apos;t cried that many times since i moved in !
come on , ross , you got a little misty when ben broke your i @-@ heart @-@ fossils mug .
i &apos;ll have you know that was a farewell gift from my colleagues at the museum .
okay ? they all chipped in for that .
they must have all loved you very much .
look , ross , sandy &apos;s just sensitive . that &apos;s all .
okay , okay . see , that is the problem . he is too sensitive .
too sensitive to take care of our baby ?
no , i mean , that guy .. these are amazing !
sandy made madeleines .
this is exactly what i &apos;m talking about .
what kind of a guy makes delicate french cookies ?
they &apos;re not even butch , manly cookies with ..
you know , with chunks !
well , you know , i don &apos;t know what to say .
i mean , i never thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men .
i gotta tell you , ross , it &apos;s not like you just came in from branding cattle .
hey , there &apos;s sensitive and there &apos;s too sensitive .
okay , what is too sensitive ?
no , i can &apos;t . i can &apos;t do this . it &apos;s bad .
but it &apos;s nice . and nice is good .
and good is not bad . ergo , we should keep kissing .
no , no . no .
but ..
ergo .
look , david , if you had never left , then ..
yeah , we &apos;d probably still be together right now .
but you did leave . and i &apos;m with mike and i really care about him .
okay .
well , he &apos;s very lucky .
thank you .
goodbye .
the key works .
hi , mike .
and , you , thanks for the face massage ! thank you !
did rachel tell you we hired a male nanny ?
i think that &apos;s great !
did she tell you he plays the recorder , recites poetry and bakes madeleines ?
how are they ?
lighter than air , but that &apos;s not the point .
rachel and i hired a male nanny .
really ?
guys do that ?
that &apos;s weird .
thank you !
that &apos;s like a woman wanting to be ..
what ?
what &apos;s the end of that sentence ?
yes . what is the end of that sentence ?
a penis model !
anyway , did you tell chandler that some guy from work ..
is the funniest guy you ever met ?
yeah . so ?
wow !
really ? do you not know chandler ?
is that why he &apos;s acting so weird ? he &apos;s jealous ?
oh , my god , that is crazy .
it &apos;s not like i &apos;m attracted to jeffrey .
so what ?
being funny is chandler &apos;s thing . like ross &apos; thing is ..
science ?
academia ? being a good father ?
i can &apos;t believe he &apos;s that upset .
are you kidding ?
that &apos;s like chandler saying he met someone who was more uptight than you .
excuse me ?
i &apos;m sorry . sorry . more controlling than you .
well , that &apos;s better .
yeah , okay .
you have to do some damage control .
because he &apos;s feeling like ..
what are you guys talking about ?
rachel and i hired a male nanny .
you got a man who &apos;s a nanny ?
you got a &quot; manny &quot; ?
you know , i don &apos;t mind a male nanny ..
but i do draw the line at male wet nurse .
you are on a roll , mister !
if i &apos;d known you guys were coming over , i would &apos;ve brought more pizza .
okay ! okay ! stop it , you ! you stop it !
what is so funny about that ?
monica ?
i don &apos;t know , it &apos;s .. just the way you say it .
i mean , you &apos;re funny . you have that funny thing . you &apos;re a funny guy !
did you tell her what we talked about ?
so those were pity laughs ? pity laughs ? !
honey , listen .
you have nothing to worry about with jeffrey .
oh , yeah ? is he funnier than me ?
well , you &apos;re different funny .
i mean , you &apos;re more sarcastic .
well , he does bits and impressions and limericks .
i do limericks .
there once was a man named chandler whose wife made him die inside .
honey , you know i think you &apos;re hilarious .
you know that joke you told me last week ?
the one about jerry lewis and the girl with the lazy eye .
that slayed me .
hey ! i made up that joke and told it to you .
not knowing when to shut up .
yep , that &apos;s my thing .
so how many guys have your key ?
it &apos;s not as bad as it looks .
i was saying goodbye to an old friend .
your lipstick &apos;s on his mouth .
we just happen to wear the same shade .
no , david and i did used to go out .
but years ago . and he lives in minsk . he &apos;s only in town for a couple days .
did you .. ?
no . no .
kiss him ?
oh , well , yeah .
yes , but .. look , she really likes you .
in fact , she stopped what was a pretty amazing kiss .
david , david , david .
no , no . he should hear this .
i don &apos;t think you realize just how lucky you are , fella .
don &apos;t point your finger at me !
why ?
what are you gonna do about it ?
well , i &apos;ll show you what i &apos;m gonna do about it .
oh , really ? really ?
you want some of that ?
stop it ! stop it ! before someone gets really hurt !
here , david , you should just go .
all right .
but if i ever do come back from minsk , well , you just better watch out .
if i go to minsk , you better watch out .
oh , you &apos;re going to minsk ?
well , i might .
really ?
well , if you do , come in the spring . it &apos;s just lovely there .
i &apos;ve heard that , actually .
okay , well , guys ?
goodbye , phoebe .
bye .
hey , what , are you kidding me ?
right @-@ o . right @-@ o .
take good care of her .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m so sorry .
if you want your key back , i totally understand .
it &apos;s never gonna happen again , right ?
right . never . i swear .
i just want to say , if you do ever come to minsk , that &apos;s my number .
we &apos;ll party up vladnik @-@ style .
yeah ! all right !
hey , ross ! check it out ! sandy taught me &quot; hot cross buns &quot; !
really ? sounded like &quot; three blind mice . &quot;
&quot; three blind mice &quot; goes like this .
i swear to god .
who &apos;s up for puppets ?
me ! i &apos;m up for puppets !
well , please welcome :
the snufflebumps !
who wants to be mr. wigglemunch and who &apos;s gonna be the grumpus ?
how exactly is a 2 @-@ month @-@ old supposed to appreciate puppets ?
studies show that the movement and colors help their cerebral development .
the whimsical characters are just for us .
i want to be mr. wigglemunch !
oh , my god .
well , i guess we know who &apos;s gonna be the grumpus !
that was kind of rude .
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
please apologize to sandy and the snufflebumps for me .
you know , he was just doing his job .
you know what ?
i &apos;m sorry i &apos;m the only one who isn &apos;t in love with gary poppins out there .
but i just .. i can &apos;t go through with this .
come on .
no ! you know what ?
i would never force you to hire someone you were this uncomfortable with .
that &apos;s true .
thank you .
you want to fire him , so you have to go do it .
so you see , wigglemunch , that &apos;s why it &apos;s important to share .
i am learning so much from you .
well , i &apos;m off to tulsa .
so if your maitre d &apos; friend has any funny oklahoma jokes ..
tell him to e @-@ mail me at www @-@ dot @-@ ha @-@ ha @-@ not @-@ so @-@ much @-@ dot @-@ com !
honey , you can relax .
last night at work jeffrey told this really sexist joke .
after that , not so funny anymore .
really ?
see , that &apos;s the thing . you gotta keep it smart , people !
don &apos;t miss that flight . you know i love you .
i love you too .
and i like you as a friend .
right .
see you later .
see you .
did the guy really make that joke ?
no , he still kills me .
last night he had me laughing so hard , i swear a little pee came out .
here goes .
i can &apos;t watch . it &apos;s like firing elmo .
sandy ? hi .
hi .
we ..
we kind of need to talk .
i &apos;m afraid it &apos;s not working out .
i mean , rachel and i think you are great with emma .
we just feel ..
you ! you feel !
i just feel ..
that the chemistry isn &apos;t right . i &apos;m sorry .
we &apos;re more than happy to give you a good recommendation .
no , that &apos;s okay . i had a lot of offers from other families .
i just picked you guys because ..
i liked you the best .
oh , damn you , geller !
anyway , well i &apos;m glad there &apos;s no hard feelings .
none at all . you need to be happy with whoever is in your home .
although , if you don &apos;t mind telling me ..
what was the problem ? maybe it &apos;s something i can work on in the future .
no , you know , it &apos;s nothing you did . it &apos;s my issue .
what is it ?
please ?
you know , i &apos;m just not that comfortable with a guy who &apos;s as sensitive as you .
that &apos;s fair .
although , can i ask , why do you think that is ?
why ? i don &apos;t know .
maybe because of my father ?
you know , when i was growing up , he was a tough guy .
you know , and as a kid , i wasn &apos;t the athlete i am now .
i play squash !
anyway , i always got the feeling he thought i was too sensitive .
that must have been hard .
it was hard .
i remember i was in my bedroom , playing with my dinosaurs ..
playing and learning .
and my father walks in and says , &quot; what are you doing with those things ?
what &apos;s wrong with you ? why aren &apos;t you outside playing like a real boy ? &quot;
but you are a real boy .
i know i am !
and when it &apos;s summer and it &apos;s hot , why can &apos;t you wear a tank top ? !
it &apos;s all right . crying is good . it lets the boo @-@ hoos out .
here comes some more !
emma , one day you &apos;re gonna grow up and be a big girl , just like your daddy .
and what &apos;s the one kind of boat that can never ever sink ?
what kind ?
a friend ship !
wow ! you blow my mind !
i gotta go .
how much do i owe you ?
twenty bucks .
it &apos;s like the cheapest college ever !
