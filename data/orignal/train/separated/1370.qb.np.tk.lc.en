morning !
perfect timing . i &apos;m done packing .
professor sullivan just e @-@ mailed me
that the keys are under the mat , and the place is all yours .
well , thank you for setting this up .
of course .
is this all you &apos;re taking ?
yeah . no ! wait !
and this .
he &apos;s coming , too .
do you really need it ?
um , it just seems a little dead .
he &apos;s not dead .
dead @-@ ish .
don &apos;t say that . he can hear you .
don &apos;t listen to her .
we could always get you a new cactus or a nice fern .
i don &apos;t want a new cactus .
i like this one .
he &apos;s a survivor .
ah . it came out of the fire .
yeah .
he might be a little charred ,
but , you know , he &apos;s still got some sharp @-@ ass thorns .
spines i think they &apos;re called .
i ... like the metaphor .
well , we &apos;ll put it on the best ledge in the house .
thank you .
all right ! okay -- oh !
can you just wait until i &apos;m gone ?
i &apos;ve been waiting .
are you even sad that i &apos;m moving out ?
nope . i &apos;m a grown man .
if i &apos;m gonna have a second toothbrush by my bathroom sink ,
i don &apos;t want it to be my sister &apos;s .
so , bye @-@ bye .
okay , don &apos;t blame your lack of a love life on me , okay ?
i don &apos;t make you wear those baseball pajamas .
ma got me those .
good luck explaining that to toothbrush number two .
thanks for taking me in .
i love you .
she &apos;s our hacker &apos;s cousin ?
yes . married name &apos;s hearn ,
not keating , which is why we didn &apos;t trip to her earlier .
she did three years at framingham for check kiting ,
was released six months ago .
that &apos;s how i found her .
our hacker was in a tagged photo
at rhonda &apos;s welcome @-@ home party .
are we sure she &apos;s linked to joe harris ?
no , but she &apos;s in jail
with our arsonist and maura &apos;s kidnapper .
that &apos;s a lot of coincidental string to hold them together .
well , let &apos;s bring her in .
i thought you might say that .
but her parole officer seems to have ... misplaced her .
since when ?
no contact for three months .
well , let &apos;s find her fast .
will do .
this spoils my experience of nature .
you hate nature .
well , i would like it a lot more
if there were fewer dead people in it .
where &apos;s the victim ?
well , this case involves a hike .
do i need my boots ?
yep .
911 got a call about an explosion this morning .
by the time the unit got here ,
jogger had found a finger .
where ?
it fell out of a tree right in front of him .
this is not an evidence bag .
no . sandwich bag .
jogger didn &apos;t want a critter
to carry off with a partial digit .
very considerate .
though my evidence now has granola on it .
kid tested , mother approved .
was our victim prone to playing with explosives in the woods ?
i haven &apos;t been up to the scene yet ,
so i &apos;m a little short of details .
which way ?
what ? what else ?
your hacker had a relative that did time at mci framingham .
rhonda hearn .
no , doesn &apos;t ring any bells .
still , maybe we &apos;re closer
to figuring out who &apos;s behind all this .
your lips to god &apos;s ears .
okay , so , powdered sand and ivory dream
are the exact same color , right ?
different texture .
we &apos;re talking about table linens .
can it really be that complicated ?
wait till you get to the centerpiece .
you have to be a horticulturist to figure that all out .
all right , what &apos;s wrong with you ?
oh , no , i &apos;m just thinking .
you know , i mean , this isn &apos;t vince &apos;s first wedding .
it &apos;s not even his second .
yeah ? so ?
so , maybe i &apos;m getting a little carried away .
it &apos;s your wedding day .
you &apos;re supposed to get carried away .
really ?
you &apos;re the bride . embrace it -- all of it .
yeah , the linens , the flowers .
the dress !
i &apos;m sorry .
no , no .
hi , ron .
what ?
yeah , well , i don &apos;t know what to say .
can i call you right back ?
yeah . yep . right back . bye .
is everything okay ?
ron was invited to a medical conference
in paris this weekend .
he asked if my passport was in order .
so he wants to take you to paris .
that &apos;s impossible , right ?
okay , okay .
i &apos;m gonna give your advice back to you .
go for it .
call him back . say yes .
say &quot; oui . &quot;
no .
it appears the cause of death was traumatic limb loss .
no !
we &apos;re gonna need more evidence bags .
not a huge charge . smaller than a grenade .
yeah .
like a homemade pipe bomb , you think ?
did the uniforms find any other bombs
or bomb @-@ making materials ?
no , just a bag of carrots .
okay , well , i &apos;ll reach out to the bomb squad .
they &apos;re gonna want to find the other pieces of the device ,
make sure it &apos;s fully detonated .
the shrapnel density and gunpowder residue
suggests it might have ...
stop .
how could you disagree with me , sergeant ?
i haven &apos;t ev ...
just stop .
there &apos;s half a possum and another crater over there .
we &apos;re standing in a minefield .
just don &apos;t move .
hello , detectives .
dr. isles .
okay , bryce , you going for , like , a pep @-@ rally thing ?
&apos;cause not peppy .
not peppy .
i can shout if that &apos;d be easier for you ,
but it is important that you hear me .
okay , listen up , first off ,
obviously , you &apos;re all gonna stay where you are .
please turn off your cellphones .
it is unlikely that a bomb of this type
was detonated remotely ,
but we do not know what else was planted here .
our plan is to use the metal detectors and the dogs
to clear safe pathways to walk you out ,
but it will take a while .
we can only clear three inches at a time .
you know what ? go back to the bullhorn .
&apos;cause what you &apos;re saying is excruciating .
hey , you know , i &apos;m in a nice , shady spot ,
so get everybody else out first , huh ?
i &apos;m kidding . i &apos;m kidding .
no , no , no . he &apos;s right .
you &apos;re all clustered together .
he &apos;s separate . it &apos;s more efficient .
is everybody clear ?
got it .
yeah .
why is it when you can &apos;t use the ladies room ,
all you want to do is use the ladies room ?
we &apos;re good . we &apos;re all good .
you never called back about paris .
i &apos;m sorry . yeah .
i , uh ...
i know you need to book the tickets .
i &apos;m still thinking .
i &apos;m moving too fast .
i @-@ i got swept up ,
and i @-@ i pushed for something that you &apos;re not ready for .
no , no , that &apos;s not it .
i would love to go away with you .
you would ?
yeah .
but , um ...
dropping everything and jetting off to europe ...
i don &apos;t know why , but ...
it &apos;s hard for me imagining myself
getting carried away like that .
i know why .
you do ?
how can you get carried away
when you &apos;re always so busy carrying everyone else ?
yeah .
maybe .
i don &apos;t want to pressure you ,
but ... i think you &apos;d love paris .
i &apos;ll see you when i get back .
okay .
is it possible whoever planted these things
had no particular target in mind ?
well , it &apos;s a really remote location .
right ?
like , maybe he was practicing .
you know , maybe he was gonna plant them elsewhere .
well , that would fit the distribution
of the explosive residue .
primarily on the front of his torso ,
but there &apos;s more on the upper torso ,
perhaps indicating that he was looking down
at the time of detonation .
hey .
yeah .
well , we should check with homeland security
and fbi and see if they &apos;ve got any home @-@ grown terrorists
on their radar in the area , you know ?
you &apos;re clear , dr. isles .
remain inside the flags as you exit .
okay . i will need a csru tech to help me with the body .
i &apos;m sorry . first priority &apos;s for the living .
the body will be retrieved when we clear the field .
but he &apos;s in the sun .
there will be a cascade of chemical reactions
that will affect my analysis .
and i don &apos;t have any photos or samples .
and what if something blows up ?
i &apos;ll be unable to help --
we &apos;ll get this done as quickly as we can .
i wish somebody had mentioned
the living / dead priority thing earlier .
hold this , please .
you &apos;re not squeamish , are you ?
oh , for chr-- he &apos;s standing in front of half a man !
if he was squeamish , we would know about it .
i &apos;m very sorry .
well , this is no way to run an investigation .
i &apos;ll try harder next time .
hey , are you okay ?
i &apos;m fine .
i &apos;m warm , annoyed , but i &apos;m -- i &apos;m fine .
you were in a minefield .
and jane and korsak are still there .
and right now we can help most by solving this
and ensuring that whoever did it can &apos;t hurt anybody else .
this is from our victim . run a tox screen .
if he built the bomb himself ,
he may have traces of 2 , 4 , 6 @-@ trinitrotoluene
in his bloodstream from inhalation or physical contact .
maura !
i &apos;m so glad you &apos;re okay .
thank you .
yeah .
thank you for your concern .
thank you both for your concern . but i &apos;m fine .
all right .
all right , so ,
based on the photos i took of the fingerprints ,
our victim is john franklin .
he is a co @-@ founder of an ngo
that specializes in de @-@ mining former war zones
and making them safe for civilians .
well , that would explain how he might get a land mine .
yeah , but it doesn &apos;t explain
why he would blow himself up in a park in boston .
you &apos;re clear .
just stay on the path on the way out , okay ?
okay , uh , when can he go ?
oh , don &apos;t worry about me , jane .
kiki will be glad i missed a meal .
i &apos;ve got something !
hang on a second .
contact .
we &apos;ve got another device .
don &apos;t move until he &apos;s flagged it .
we don &apos;t want any motion in the area while he &apos;s working .
mr. park ,
how long have you and john been doing this work ?
10 years .
we joined the peace corps after college .
saw the damage the mines can do .
decided to do something about it .
the way john was killed seems very specific to your work .
does your ngo have any enemies ?
plenty .
governments of countries who don &apos;t want us there ,
people who think we could be doing more .
john took most of the heat for it .
he was the face of our organization .
fundraising , government relations , that kind of thing ?
yeah . yeah , he was great at it .
our bomb squad just found another mine .
what ? where ?
in the same place .
whoever did this was determined to take him out .
can i help ? i &apos;m an expert in de @-@ mining .
i @-@ i appreciate the offer ,
but what would really help is to figure out who killed him .
can you put together a list of the places you &apos;ve worked ,
uh , copies of his e @-@ mails , employee records ?
of course .
anyone with a grudge against you
is a potential suspect now , all right ?
okay , jane , mine &apos;s flagged .
you can go now .
um , okay . i &apos;m -- i &apos;m --
i &apos;m just gonna wait for you over here , okay ?
oh , don &apos;t be silly . it &apos;s a million degrees .
get in the shade . get some water .
i @-@ it &apos;s fine . i don &apos;t mind waiting .
would you get me a pizza -- sausage and onion ?
really ?
okay .
i &apos;ll get it in one of those sleeves ,
keep it extra hot .
don &apos;t get any closer .
i &apos;m not sure it &apos;s safe .
i stepped on one . i &apos;m standing on a land mine .
normally , you step on a mine ,
it explodes within seconds ,
but we think that korsak stepped on the edge of it
and it rocked up and that &apos;s how he saw it .
well , if it didn &apos;t explode , can you just step off of it ?
we can &apos;t risk it rocking back into place
and activating the pressure plate .
well , how are you gonna get him off of it ?
we &apos;re not sure yet .
okay .
where are you going ?
to go sit with him !
no , jane , you got to stay outside the potential blast zone .
let me explain something to you .
that is one of the finest detectives i have ever known ,
and he is standing out there alone ,
waiting to see if he &apos;s gonna blow up .
i &apos;m going .
kent , i need you to go up to the bombing site .
sure .
how many technicians do you want me to take ?
none . just your medical bag .
sergeant korsak is standing on a land mine .
i think your experiences in afghanistan
have made you uniquely qualified to help if things ...
go sideways .
i have one thing i have to do ,
but i will be there as soon as i can .
okay .
close enough , jane .
jane , i mean it . stop .
apparently , this is close enough .
you look ridiculous .
shouldn &apos;t you be out catching a murderer ?
you want me to go back to work ?
you walk over here and make me .
apparently , our victim came up here a lot .
so someone planted enough mines he &apos;d step on one eventually .
yeah .
if you &apos;re patient ,
it &apos;s not a stupid way to murder someone .
no stupider than any other way .
yeah .
you know , i &apos;ve developed a new appreciation
to what you &apos;ve been going through .
what do you mean ?
not to go too deep with the metaphor ,
but the thought of your life being blown up by unseen forces .
yeah , no , that -- that &apos;s too deep .
are you sure you &apos;re dealing with it all okay ?
yeah . i &apos;m fine .
&apos;cause i &apos;m a little shaky .
thinking how life with kiki &apos;s so great .
it can all be gone in an instant .
and i &apos;ve only been out here a couple hours .
nothi--
nothing is gonna happen to you , okay ?
i &apos;m not gonna let it .
and i -- and i got pizza standing by .
okay ?
how &apos;s the -- how &apos;s the wedding planning ?
since you brought it up ,
i &apos;ve been meaning to ask you something .
you want to be my best man ... so to speak ?
well , do i have to ... throw you a @-@ a bachelor party ?
&apos;cause i &apos;m in for poker .
you know , not so much on the strippers .
what &apos;s going on ?
they &apos;re gonna -- they &apos;re gonna remove that bomb .
so ...
i &apos;m too old for a bachelor party .
no , you &apos;re not .
yeah , i am .
i &apos;d be honored to be your best man .
who gets angry at people for removing mines ?
well , there &apos;s millions of mines all around the world .
and a lot of governments don &apos;t want americans
coming in and digging them up .
so if someone flew here to send that message ...
or they were here already , in an embassy , maybe .
maybe .
keep sorting through the e @-@ mails .
see if anyone sounds like
they &apos;re gonna take things a step further .
how &apos;s jane &apos;s case coming ?
any luck finding the hacker &apos;s cousin ?
she was living in a residential hotel until last month .
no forwarding address ,
but i got a d.a. to sign off on a warrant for her cellphone .
mm @-@ hmm . hopefully , that leads somewhere .
i think you &apos;re working about five times harder
than the rest of us .
how &apos;s it going ?
they &apos;re about to remove land mine number two .
well , i guess number three
&apos;cause one already exploded , right ?
anyway , they &apos;re removing a mine ,
and it &apos;s not the one that korsak &apos;s standing on .
how are we going with our tests ?
well , the only explosive chemicals in our victim &apos;s blood
or on that fingertip were already combusted .
so he didn &apos;t build or hold the mines ?
it doesn &apos;t appear so .
someone just blew him up .
is this the sample ?
yes .
great . thank you . that &apos;s gonna help a lot .
what is it ?
a lifetime &apos;s worth of favors .
what are you gonna do with the bomb ?
protocol is to blow it up on scene ,
which we &apos;ll do once the sergeant &apos;s safe .
well , is there any way to disarm it ,
you know , so we can keep it for evidence ?
highly irregular .
come on , bryce . help us out .
i &apos;m letting you be a hero today .
tell you what , let &apos;s talk about this
over a nice glass of water
when everybody &apos;s finished for the day , okay ?
is that a deal ?
this is goethite .
it &apos;s a mineral found in limpet teeth .
limpet ? like the snail ?
it &apos;s the strongest material found in nature .
it &apos;s stronger than kevlar .
yeah , maura got it for us .
it &apos;s from the advanced material research center .
learning all sorts of things today ,
like how long it takes your ass to go numb
from not moving .
yeah .
and that snails have teeth .
uh @-@ oh . rubber &apos;s about to hit the road .
uh , now that the field is clear , um ...
they &apos;ll use the limpet teeth to protect you
in case the bomb goes off
when they yank you off of it .
yank ? doesn &apos;t sound very technical .
time to head back to the command center .
okay , go ahead .
no . you .
no !
this is bryce &apos;s operation , detective .
and i &apos;m not going anywhere , sergeant .
please , jane .
vince ...
it &apos;s gonna be all right .
got limpet &apos;s teeth .
look , i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t call you sooner .
we were dealing with a bomb .
had to call in the bomb squad .
yeah , everything &apos;s all right .
am i fine ? of course .
but i &apos;ll -- i &apos;ll call you later .
yeah , love you , too .
it &apos;s a story best told in person .
i also got a text from nina .
she found the hacker &apos;s cousin .
yeah . about an hour ago . she &apos;s in interrogation .
this woman could lead us to the person who &apos;s been after you .
why didn &apos;t you come here and talk to her ?
&apos;cause i was waiting for you .
i stayed out of trouble since my release .
i got nothing to say to you guys .
you haven &apos;t spoken to your parole officer in three months .
that &apos;s bullshit .
tell him to empty his voice mailbox .
i do what i &apos;m supposed to do .
you know her ?
don &apos;t remember .
her name &apos;s lianne sampson .
you were in framingham together .
yeah , and so were like 2,000 other people .
you want to show me their pictures , too ?
how about dr. joe harris ?
who &apos;s that ?
prison psychiatrist .
don &apos;t need a shrink . never have .
did you ever talk to anyone in framingham
about your cousin riley --
the one who &apos;s good with computers ?
no .
and why the hell would i tell you if i had ?
look , rhonda , you don &apos;t seem like the type of person
that would make a plan to take out a cop and her family ,
so why don &apos;t you just drop the attitude --
i &apos;m done .
you sit down !
sit down !
that &apos;s enough , jane .
now !
i &apos;m gonna sue your ass !
you &apos;re gonna sue me ?
i &apos;ll give you a reason to sue me !
all right , all right , all right ,
shut up . sit down !
i &apos;ll give you a reason to sue me !
get outside .
you sit with me for an hour while i &apos;m standing on a bomb ,
but you can &apos;t deal with a shithead parolee for 10 minutes ?
oh , i &apos;m so sorry !
oh , you will be sorry , i bet !
she burned my house down !
no , she did not !
but at least we know we &apos;re on the right track .
the only definitive answer we got in there
was that she didn &apos;t talk about the hacker in prison .
which means she talked about the hacker in prison .
yes !
we were looking at thousands
of inmates , employees , vendors .
now we can narrow it down
to the folks that actually intersected with joe harris ,
lianne sampson , and rhonda .
you &apos;re right .
you &apos;re right .
after all that time in the sun ,
i &apos;m surprised you had the energy to go after her like that .
she was really annoying .
oh , yes , she was .
you look flush .
i ... might have just lost it on a suspect .
it &apos;s just been one of those days .
what &apos;s this ?
this is a disemboweled land mine
made of salvaged parts from junkyards and old machinery .
it roughly follows some plans that i found on the internet .
can we trace it ?
no fingerprints or dna that i &apos;ve been able to find .
no serial numbers on the parts .
the only thing that might be able to help you
is that the gunpowder that was used as the explosive element
has boron in it .
and what would that do ?
make it explode in a green color .
it &apos;s often used in fireworks and military flares .
it &apos;s something .
okay .
thank you .
for what ?
for the teeth thingy .
my pleasure .
our victim had enemies .
narrowing down the hate mails , are we ?
i ran it through a search engine
that responds to certain trigger words .
anything threatening or violent in nature .
the e @-@ mails with the highest number of trigger words
all came from the same person --
jenny evans .
looks like she was on the ground in the cambodian village
that the ngo recently evacuated .
she worked for franklin ?
yeah .
until she quit .
she seems pissed .
well , she &apos;s passionate . that &apos;s for sure .
let &apos;s bring her in and see what she &apos;s been doing
since she got back from southeast asia .
sure .
there &apos;s something that you &apos;re hiding
about this bomb situation .
kiki .
i could hear it in your voice ,
and i can see it in your face .
the bomb was actually a land mine .
i stepped on it . i had to be extracted .
it was a precision operation .
our bomb techs are the best .
here i am without a scratch .
oh , my god .
but you could have been --
that &apos;s the job .
i know .
i know that .
i fully intended to tell you ,
but i &apos;m so in it trying to find the sicko
that put that mine in the ground .
i &apos;m okay .
are you ?
i don &apos;t -- i ...
i think i need time .
okay . whatever you need .
but i &apos;m glad you &apos;re safe .
me too .
i can &apos;t believe this is how i &apos;m finding out that john &apos;s dead .
walter should have at least called me .
even though you didn &apos;t work there anymore ?
i was more than just an employee .
john and i were together for years
until a couple of months ago .
you sent some pretty angry e @-@ mails , threatening , even .
yeah , well , they were supposed to be a wake @-@ up call ,
which didn &apos;t work , obviously .
what do you mean , &quot; wake @-@ up calls &quot; ?
he was losing perspective ,
falling into the money trap .
there &apos;s plenty of profit to be made in the nonprofit world .
trust me .
is it so bad to make a little money while helping others ?
except they weren &apos;t helping others ,
not as much as they could .
they were going to parties , being full of themselves .
a couple of photo ops with a congressman
does not make you bono .
did john ever write you back ?
no .
last i heard , he was shagging some hotel heiress
he met at a vanity fai party .
i mean , i can &apos;t believe that &apos;s who he &apos;s become .
katherine bryant , 38 .
her family controls a chain
of budget motels across the country .
company &apos;s valued around $ 1 billion .
never heard of her .
yeah , i think that &apos;s how she likes it .
she &apos;s a notoriously private person .
her online presence has been totally scrubbed .
i was able to find one article that mentions her
from equatorial guinea .
it &apos;s a piece about the de @-@ mining efforts in that region .
and she just happens to be with our victim .
for 3.1 / 2 weeks .
are we talking about the heiress ?
current theory -- scorned woman plants land mine .
you got anything better ?
i do .
jilted husband plants mine
to send message to victim and cheating wife .
husband ?
i found no record of a husband .
she didn &apos;t change her name .
and on paper , they exist as very separate entities ,
but yes , she is married .
i bet the husband didn &apos;t like seeing her
in the paper with another man halfway around the world .
all the politics aside ,
we might have a crime of passion on our hands .
hey ! you want to grab some dinner ?
there &apos;s a pub in charlestown i &apos;ve been dying to try .
i just made noodles .
what &apos;s all this ?
every single person who was at framingham
during rhonda &apos;s stay .
so , what are you looking for exactly ?
i am trying to figure out which of them
interacted with both rhonda and joe harris while there .
what are you doing ?
helping you .
no , maura . come on . it &apos;s late .
you don &apos;t have to do this .
look , you &apos;re not the only one
that this is happening to , all right ?
i want to find this name as badly as you do .
so , just think of me as one more cactus on your ledge .
want some noodles ?
sure .
good night .
what &apos;s this ?
oh , uh , swatches .
for your reception .
you know , this morning , i woke up , had coffee ,
promised kiki i &apos;d go cake @-@ tasting
with her on saturday .
then i went to work and ...
spent the day wondering
whether it would be my last one on earth .
wow , hearing you say it is so scary .
and a good reminder .
what , of all the murderers out there ?
no . that life is unpredictable and precious .
we should always live for the moment --
land mine or no land mine .
hmm . you know what , vince ?
i think you have to get someone
to cover my shift tomorrow night .
thanks .
good night .
with your support ,
we can maximize resources and save countless lives .
my business plan is built on restraint and transparency .
your dollars go to the communities we serve ,
not into the pockets of corporate bureaucrat--
he &apos;s very compelling .
and apparently not the cheating type .
our heiress told us she was funding his mission .
she was in africa to observe his operation .
we believe her ?
our financial people sent over the paperwork .
they were definitely making a deal .
said he had an epiphany .
he wanted to get back to his roots ,
in terms of his original vision .
so it wasn &apos;t an affair .
well , he was kind of cheating on his business partner .
yeah , he told the heiress that his partner , park ,
was more interested in executive perks
than in the mission itself .
our guy wanted to start over ,
downsize the administrative costs of the ngo .
oh . so bye @-@ bye parties and photo ops .
guess what we just found at walter park &apos;s house .
not walter park ?
nope .
and uniforms stopped by his office .
he &apos;s not there , either .
but we did find john franklin &apos;s investor video .
so he knew .
which gives him a big , fat motive .
he knew he was about to lose his oversized salary .
the prison list .
i &apos;ve highlighted some names i think you &apos;ll want to look at .
thank you .
here it is .
park has a waterfront property in new hampshire .
oh , and look at that .
he throws an anuual 4th of july celebration there
with a dazzling display of fireworks .
and the fireworks would explain
the boron in the gunpowder we found in the mine .
who wants to go to new hampshire ?
