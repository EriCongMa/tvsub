The Graysons murdered my father
Tell her about the white-haired man.
There was a man who visited Grayson
the morning your father died.
This feeling comes along once or twice in a lifetime,
if we're lucky.
I want full immunity in exchange for the information
I'm about to give you.
This is agent McGowen of the S.E.C.
Come down to the federal building
And answer some questions.
Would you like to comment on the allegations of corruption?
My father is the victim of a witch hunt.
Conrad confessed everything to Daniel.
He could've come clean.
He could've ended the whole thing.
What are you gonna do now?
I'm gonna track down the man who killed my father.
they say grief occurs in five stages.
First, there's denial...
Followed by anger.
Then comes bargaining...
And depression.
Hey, did you know
that Amanda turned 10 this summer?
Whatever happens with your investigation,
can you make sure that a copy of this interview gets to her?
I guess I just want Amanda to know that...
Not every day is a terrible one.
Your dad had a good day today, sweetheart.
I hope you did, too.
I love you.
For most, the final stage of grief
is acceptance.
But for me...
Grief is a life sentence without clemency.
I will never accept and I will never forgive,
not even after the man who killed my father
lies dead at my feet.
Agent McGowen canceled his one-on-one interview.
What do you think that means?
It means their fishing expedition
came up empty.
Well, that's good news.
Chances are, McGowen is just gonna head for deeper waters.
So what do we do in the meantime?
We keep the P.R. Machine running overtime
to mitigate the damage they've already caused.
Ashley's plans to tie your wedding
into rehabilitating our corporate image
is a very good one.
Just make sure Emily's on board with that.
And... we need to ensure
that the outstanding loose ends from your trial
remain tied up,
Mainly... that Jack Porter
keeps his version of the events of that night to himself.
I've got a plan for that.
Good. Get on it, son.
Daniel...
I can't tell you
how much your loyalty through this challenging time
means to me.
Family first, like you said.
But when we're through this,
I wanna hold you to the promise you made me.
100% transparency from here on out.
Are you watching?
Yeah.
What do you think Daniel meant about his plan for Jack?
I don't know what he's capable of anymore.
Business as usual, I see.
What the hell are you doing here?
The feds are all over me.
Precisely the reason for my visit.
Emily...
You've become, as they say in your profession,
a bad asset.
Look, I understand your employers are nervous,
but I assure you...
I have all of this handled.
I'm afraid your word isn't going to satisfy the initiative.
Well, what else can I possibly offer?
That question is being addressed as we speak.
Handsome family.
You must be very proud.
My god, Ems...
It's him.
Emily, are you there?
I'm here.
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna create a reason for them to meet again.
And then I'm gonna track the white-haired man
to wherever he's hiding.
And then?
You already know the answer to that.
第一季第二十一集
You feeling any better?
Your headache last night--
I can't remember you being sick the whole time I've known you.
Well, we haven't known each other all that long,
have we?
Emily, what's going on? Talk to me.
What ever happened to Paris...
Eloping, just the two of us?
That was before everything.
All right, Grayson Global has a massive image problem,
and since I'm the one who's largely responsible,
I feel like it's my job to fix it.
By making our wedding a big, public spectacle?
Look, Ashley and I are cutting out early today
so she can pitch us her ideas.
A big, splashy wedding,
one of your parents' events--
It's not exactly me or you the last time I checked.
Last time I checked, you were practically pushing me
to claim my father's mantle at the company.
Look, Ashley's put a lot of work into this,
and it may not be you or even me,
but given what my family's been through,
can we just sit down with her for five minutes?
Please.
Of course I can.
I love you.
Have a good run.
Dr. Clemons is here.
Should we find somewhere else to do this?
Not if you're comfortable in here.
I'd hate to interrupt the progress you're making.
It's ironic, right?
Daniel goes free,
And now I'm the one basically under house arrest.
打开
No school, no father,
no friends, no Declan.
In terms of school,
I've already spoken to the dean,
and you will be starting again next week.
And as for Declan,
Do not forget that his lies
are what put you here in the first place.
His and yours.
Speaking of which,
Dr. Clemons wants to do a family therapy session tonight.
That is never going to happen.
Why, because you and dad despise each other?
Dr. Clemons says
the only way I can overcome my anger issues
is to learn to forgive,
which will be a whole lot easier to do
if you and dad do the same.
Ready to get started?
Yes, why don't you, Charlotte?
We'll talk about this later, hmm?
Mrs. Grayson.
Agent Mcgowen,
why isn't my ex-husband in prison?
Because we haven't found any physical evidence of
a conspiracy to frame David Clarke.
Well, then you haven't looked hard enough.
Before Conrad's head of security was murdered,
he told me that he had personally amassed enough evidence
to put everyone involved in jail for good.
Now have you searched his Manhattan apartment?
Our warrant is restricted to the corporate offices.
And the prosecutor can't build a federal case on your word alone.
Well, he won't have to.
You and your team are obviously incapable of
finding the proof that you need,
but I assure you that I'm more than capable.
I'm determined.
Do you think I don't see right through this?
See through what, Porter?
It's a check, not a shoe bomb.
It's blood money.
It's to keep me quiet about your parents
framing their personal thug for Tyler's murder.
You're wrong.
The guy was a drifter.
He had no ties to my parents
other than the fact that he was blackmailing them.
They were victims of his, too.
Really?
Come on, buddy. Drink some water.
Okay, look, I get you don't trust me.
I'm trying to fix that...
Still not feeling well, Sammy?
for Emily's sake.
She told me how invested in Haiti you are,
and I know my trial threw off your plans
to get down there and help.
I also know you have this bar and your brother
and a girl somewhere out there that you care about.
And I just thought this money might help you...
do some good in the world...
Any way you choose to use it.
I see you've been redecorating.
I find your choice of fine art in the foyer
to be very inspired.
Yeah, well, the De Kooning has a sentimental value.
Ah. You look good, Conrad.
And you look like a demonic succubus.
You think I didn't know that
you were the one who sicced the S.E.C. on me?
I've done no such thing.
If you go down,
you'll only bring me down with you.
You've already told me that a thousand times.
You can trust me, I'm not gonna go down without a fight.
Well, as strained as things have been between us,
you know I wouldn't want that, Conrad.
Well, then I assume you're here
to return the key to the apartment.
No, Charlotte's the reason I'm here.
Her addiction counselor has called for
A family therapy session this evening.
Now how shall I report back?
Oh, you can tell her,
I wouldn't miss that for the world.
That's not for you.
Hello, Victoria.
Lydia.
Ever the opportunist, I see.
What's she doing here?
What she does best--
Using her children as a wedge issue for...
What is it exactly that you came here for, dear?
Oh, well, then,
Please allow me to invite you to leave.
So this is where you live.
Yep, it's home sweet home.
Cool.
My uncle owns a cop bar.
I spent nearly every night there growing up
before my mom won the slimy rich husband lottery.
Yeah?
You, uh, you want to go a round of shuffleboard?
I-I think we should just plow through this econ project.
It'll take me two seconds to kick your ass.
Look, kind of something I used to do with my ex.
Oh, right, the, uh, pill head.
Charlotte's not a pill head.
She's been through a lot.
Yeah, well, who hasn't been through a lot?
I just moved here from Yonkers,
Which, for the record, is ten times harder
to get out of your system than oxy.
It's a joke, Declan.
Sorry for trying to make you laugh.
Yeah, I'm not in much of a laughing mood these days.
Getting that.
Clearly, you don't want to be here,
and neither do I, so, uh,
Let's just get this over with.
What on god's green earth am I encrypting?
Home video.
Of you and daniel...
Sleeping.
Mm. I need you to e-mail an anonymous copy to Conrad.
Okay.
This is getting kinkier and creepier by the moment.
May I ask what you hope to gain by this?
Conrad will see it as a threat.
He'll think the white-haired man is spying on his son,
And he'll be forced to reach out to him.
You may be a lot of things--
Black belt in Karate, impeccable dresser,
and a certified sociopath--
But you're not a killer.
You don't know what I am or what I'm capable of.
And you don't know what he's capable of, Ems.
Who's to say he won't kill you first?
That's a risk I'm willing to take.
Send it.
I see my credit cards got some exercise this morning.
Oh, nothing's better than the second floor of Bendel's.
Sounds like you've had a pleasant day.
Monique lhuillier offered to design a wedding dress for me.
Seems someone gave her the impression
we're headed for the altar.
Victoria playing one of her little games, no doubt.
Not that it's the worst idea.
They do say third time's the charm.
You really know how to sweep a girl off her feet.
I'm gonna have to call you back.
Okay.
Yes?
Yeah, I got your message, you son of a bitch.
There's a restaurant at the corner of 7th Avenue
and 10th in Brooklyn. You be there at 5:00,
or I unleash a contingency plan of my own.
Emily.
Where are you headed off to in such a rush?
I have to go get ready.
I've got my monthly meeting with the Landmark Committee.
Not today you don't. We got a wedding to plan.
I'm so sorry. I'm gonna have to reschedule.
Emily, I cleared my afternoon for this.
You knew that.
I'm sure the Landmark Committee can survive a month without you.
But unfortunately,
my epic plans for your wedding may not.
I promise,
I'll make my presentation as painless as possible.
杰克·波特 一百万美元
$1 million?
Jack...
You must really have them worried.
The Graysons are the last people I want to be indebted to,
But if Emily's already planning on joining 'em...
Look, I-I was thinking
I could start a charity with the money.
Maybe it's something she and I could do together.
You still care about her, don't you?
We both do, don't we?
I care about you.
That's why you have to cash this,
'cause if you don't,
They may find a more...
permanent way of keeping you quiet.
Oh. Gotta take this.
Nolcorp Japan.
Konnichiwa.
If you meant what you said
when you promised to help avenge my father,
then I'm asking you to prove it to me right now.
Ems... Calm down. Breathe.
I can't. I'm stuck here with Daniel,
And I'm not gonna make it to the city on time.
In-- in time for what?
The video worked.
Conrad's meeting the white-haired man
at a restaurant at 5:00.
This might be my last chance to track him down
before he disappears again.
I need you to go there and follow him home,
find out where he lives.
Ems, what's going on?
I'm just, uh, letting the committee know
that I won't make it on time.
Yes, absolutely.
The meeting should go on without me.
That's right. It's the corner
of 7th Ave. and 10th Street in Brooklyn.
I'll call you later.
Oh, well, we're getting a little ahead of ourselves,
aren't we?
I'm calling Conrad.
We used to be such good friends, Lydia.
What happened?
You held me hostage at Grayson Manor
after your attack dog threw me off the roof of my own apartment.
Well, you certainly have a knack
for landing on your feet, now don't you?
What are you doing here, Victoria?
Conrad's finished with you, and so am I.
I am giving you a lifeline.
The question is, are you wise enough to accept it?
I learned that lesson already.
Fool me twice, shame on me, right?
Well, in this case, the shame is on all of us.
After all these years,
the government is quietly building a case against Conrad
and his role in the downing of that plane,
not to mention what happened to David Clarke.
And given that you perjured yourself
all those years ago in federal court,
they're going to be coming after you, too.
You did this, didn't you?
Well, let's just say, I got the ball rolling.
And I had the good fortune to secure myself immunity
in exchange for my cooperation.
And as your friend,
I've asked them to grant you the same courtesy.
I couldn't help but notice the de Kooning
the last time I was here.
Conrad had it relocated from his office.
He said it was the most important piece in his collection.
It isn't worth the canvas it's painted on,
and he knows it.
I don't understand.
It's a forgery.
I know because I had it commissioned,
and I passed it off on him.
That's how we met.
The question is...
Why would Conrad hold on to something
that he knows has little value whatsoever?
Other than you, of course.
Obviously, we're not talking William and Kate territory,
but you are considered American royalty.
Well, Daniel is.
Your heritage is still a little bit of a mystery, Emily.
But in this case, that's a good thing.
We can spin the fairy tale any way we want.
Emily.
You know where I stand.
I'm a very private person. Always have been.
You can have an intimate wedding
and still generate plenty of public interest,
not to mention press opportunities.
Front page of the Sunday style sections...
Like I said, I got your threat, loud and clear.
You're the only one issuing threats here.
Contingency plan?
That's right.
Names, dates, video recordings, bank transactions,
the original hard drive from David Clarke's computer--
every piece of evidence from the first day
you darkened my door 20 years ago
straight through to the prison murder of Lee Moran last month.
It's quite a dossier.
Mutually assured destruction.
Damn right.
If you ever threaten to harm my son,
his fiancee, or anyone in my family ever again,
I detonate.
I never threatened your son.
I'm not gonna play this game with you.
Whatever the hell's going on, you stay away from my family,
or I'm gonna expose you and your employers to everyone.
Do you understand?
That's it.
Daniel, what are you doing?
Who's so important that you can't be present with me
on this for five minutes without exchanging texts?
It's none of your business.
And none of this is me.
Have you forgotten who I am, who you're marrying?
Have you? I'm a Grayson, Emily.
There are certain pressures and expectations placed upon me,
upon us.
Maybe you've forgotten the family you're marrying into.
Trust me, Daniel.
I couldn't forget your family if I tried.
I'm done.
Ashley--
Please don't say you're sorry. You so clearly are not.
Hey, Dec, you seen Sammy?
No, I thought he was with you.
Did you check upstairs?
I checked everywhere.
Who's Sammy?
My brother's dog.
It's freezing out there.
You didn't let him out and then forget, did you?
No, no, in fact, I've had a hard time
getting him to go out at all these past couple days.
I'm gonna go look for him.
Give me a call if he shows up, okay?
Yeah.
Screw the presentation.
If you want to go look for him, let's do it.
I finally got rid of Ashley and Daniel.
Tell me you didn't lose him.
I've got an address.
He's there now.
Thank you, Nolan.
Once you turn this corner, Emily,
everything changes.
Are you certain you want to do this?
It's the only thing I'm certain of anymore.
Text me the address.
I'm working on a solution.
First I have to identify who's threatening Grayson's family.
This isn't some nosy fed we're dealing with.
Someone's on to us.
Be right there!
Can I help you?
Uh, yeah, I'm here about
the, uh, cable outages in the neighborhood.
I didn't know there was a problem with my cable.
Oh, yeah.
The brownouts fried all the boxes on your block.
You didn't notice the lights flickering?
Come on in.
He couldn't let you do it.
Where is he?
He wouldn't say.
Clearly, whatever it is you're planning tonight,
It's not the answer.
Hey, I wonder what your father would think of this?
He'd probably wonder how his little girl
got to such a point.
Alone. That's how I got here.
But you're not alone.
Nolan intervened so that you wouldn't make
a life-altering mistake.
It's not his job to protect me.
No, that was your mother and father's.
What I remember about my mother
is that she was sick my entire childhood
until she died,
And as for my father, well,
we both know what happened there.
You are so strong-willed,
just like David was.
Death comes on its own.
There's no need in hastening it.
Tell that to the people
who were on the plane when it exploded.
There might be a time and a place for kindness and fairness,
but this is definitely not one of them.
Good-bye, Carole.
This, uh, clock shows official U.S. Time, which, uh,
I can see might be of interest to you.
Or not.
Sorry for the inconvenience.
One more thing before you go.
Do you have a card?
So I can talk to your supervisor...
to tell him how...
happy I am with the service.
Coming to fix a problem I didn't even know I had.
Um, you know, uh...
I don't.
We're practically, uh, a paperless company.
You know, trying to offset our carbon footprint.
Uh, we do have a web site
where you can submit a form.
I'll do that, Burt.
What's your last name?
Uh, Simmons.
Have a good evening.
You, too, Burt.
Lydia...
What's happened?
Victoria...
I came home, and she was here,
tearing your painting into pieces.
She said you were hiding evidence
that could destroy us all.
I-I tried to stop her, but I couldn't.
That woman is a monster, Conrad.
You knew what this meant to me.
I can't believe you would betray me with the one thing.
I didn't betray you, Ems.
I'm giving you options.
Now at least you can gather intel on the guy.
Find out who he is.
You listen to me, Nolan.
How about you listen to me for once?
Hello?
Sammy?
Sammy, hey, buddy.
Sammy!
Jack.
Emily, hey.
Sammy's here.
Thank god.
I can't believe I didn't think to look there.
Is he okay?
Jack, I think you better hurry.
It's okay, buddy.
Mrs. Grayson, why don't you go first?
Dear charlotte,
I like that you're taking your counseling seriously,
but I need you to stop demonizing me
and lionizing your father.
Both of you.
Good.
Who'd like to go next?
I'll go.
Glad you could join us, Mr. Grayson.
So what game are we playing?
We're playing "I like but I need."
It's fun. You'll see.
Just sit--
That's all right, doc. I've got this from here.
Daniel...
I like very much
that you've made the family business your own,
And all I really need from you
is your continued loyalty through the rough days ahead.
Charlotte, I like that you've taken control
of this problem,
and I need you to promise me that you'll stay on this track.
Victoria, you know, believe it or not,
I actually like your spirit of self-preservation.
Always have, in fact.
And I thoroughly appreciate how much you have challenged me
at every turn throughout the course
of our spectacular failure of a marriage...
Oh, Mr. Grayson, that's not--
Because it has taught me how to see...
right through you.
And as for what I need from you, well, by gosh,
all I really need is for you to come to your anemic senses
and return everything you just stole from me.
And, Conrad,
I like that you suspect me, predictable as you are,
but I need you to know
that others have been betraying you as well,
even while warming your bed.
Mom,
what have you done now?
Nothing I wouldn't do again.
This is hopeless.
Nothing in this house is ever gonna change.
The only way out of it is to leave.
Bravo, Conrad.
That display of yours should go miles
towards helping Charlotte's recovery.
I can get him into the truck, take him back to the Stowaway.
He used up all his energy getting here.
I think this is where he wants to be.
Even after all these years...
He's home.
You know, every day...
Every day's been a gift.
I was starting to think he was gonna live forever.
I can't do it.
I don't know if I have it in me
to say good-bye to him.
Sammy...
Sammy, thank you.
Thank you for being such a good friend...
Such a good listener.
And thank you for making me smile...
Every day, even on the worst of 'em.
Thank you for teaching me about loyalty...
and friendship.
Thank you for teaching me how to love.
Oh, Sammy, thank you, thank you, thank you.
thank you, thank you. Thank you.
Sammy.
Are you licking daddy?
Oh, yeah, that's great.
Oh, Sammy.
It's okay. It's okay.
You go on now, okay?
You go play.
You go play.
We're right here.
Come on.
Who splashes someone with ice-cold slush
and just drives off?
A trucker from Yonkers.
Well, look, let's get you dry.
Um, I got towels in the bathroom.
But one second.
Here.
Um, do you have any pictures of your dog?
We can take the poster boards
from that presentation we're gonna fail
and put them to good use.
Good idea.
Declan.
Oh, what are you doing here? Are you okay?
They're awful, Declan...
My entire family.
Look, I'm...
I'm so sorry for pulling your tuition.
I'll cash in one of my savings bonds--
Actually, I got it covered.
Or Nolan does. I mean, the guy's got a... heart
as big as his checkbook.
See?
Someone else appreciates how good you are.
Can I stay with you tonight?
Are all your T-shirts deep V's?
You'd do great with the girls back home in Yonkers.
Wow. You work fast.
Oh, Charlotte, it's not what you think it is.
Yonkers, huh?
Didn't even need the trashy tee to figure that one out.
What did you just say?
Because I'm pretty sure you don't know
the first thing about my life.
You, on the other hand, are a walking tabloid.
Everyone has things in their past
they don't want people to know about.
Right, Declan?
Are you really so blinded by your hatred for dad
that you've lost sight of me and Charlotte?
I have always had both of your best interests at heart.
Your father is guilty of heinous crimes, Daniel.
And what about you?
I know the whole story, so you can quit playing innocent.
Dad told me everything.
I don't know what lies he told you,
but you would do well to remember
that there are three sides to every story.
Oh, and which one did you sell to the feds?
You go through with destroying dad,
and you're dead to me.
He was a really good friend.
So were you.
Oh, Jack, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I think that should be it.
I'll go get him.
Are you okay?
It's just nice, having somebody with me.
I always thought it would be Amanda.
Now it feels like the only part of me
left hanging on to her is gonna be buried with him.
Maybe Sammy knew it was time for you to let go.
Maybe that's why he jumped up on you in the park that day...
why he kept running over to your house.
He was leading me to you.
Emily...
What are we gonna do now?
I don't know.
You're late.
Relax.
I'm going to agree to your ultimatum.
My devotion to you trumps everything, Daniel.
I only hope that I can repair the damage I've caused.
This is the evidence I was planning on turning over.
Now your father had it stashed away for years as insurance
because he's not the only one it incriminates.
What you choose to do it with it...
is entirely up to you.
Yes, Daniel?
Mom buckled. She gave me the evidence.
It's right here in my briefcase.
Good work, son.
Bring it to me in the morning.
Dec...
I got some bad news.
Sammy?
He's gone.
I was just gonna call you.
Oh, to yell at me again for saving your life?
No.
To thank you.
I'm starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel.
If I had gone through with it today...
There'd be no light...
ever.
But now...
We have got eyes inside his house.
You shoulda seen me, Ems.
I hacked into an electrical grid,
jammed a satellite, and...
paid off a cable guy.
You'd have been proud.
I am proud.
You're a good friend.
I gotta go.
They say grief occurs in five stages.
First, there's denial.
Emily?
Followed by anger.
Daniel, I'm so sorry.
Oh, babe, I, uh...
then comes bargaining, depression,
and acceptance.
Come on. Let's go to bed.
But grief is a merciless master.
Just when you think you're free...
you realize, you never stood a chance.
8:20?
