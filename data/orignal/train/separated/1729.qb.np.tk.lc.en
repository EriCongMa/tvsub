第七季 第七集
i &apos;ve never seen him this happy before .
that &apos;s because you &apos;ve never seen him
on &quot; restock the medicine cabinet day . &quot;
look !
a new topical antihistamine with lidocaine .
i can &apos;t wait until i get a rash .
oh , gas @-@ x has a new ultra strength .
i guess they really do read their mail .
hey , isn &apos;t that professor proton ?
oh , yeah .
look at him , just standing in line
like he wasn &apos;t moderately famous 30 years ago .
let &apos;s go say hello .
oh , maybe we shouldn &apos;t bother him .
i &apos;m not going to bother him , i &apos;m going to talk to him .
he thinks there &apos;s a difference .
arthur ?
arthur , it &apos;s me--
sheldon cooper .
you may not remember because of your advanced age .
trust me , i ... i remember .
this is my girlfriend , amy .
amy , this is television legend arthur jeffries .
his science show inspired millions of children .
ho @-@ hold on .
you ... you have a girlfriend ?
yes , and i &apos;ve heard so much about you .
hey look-- we &apos;re wearing the same orthopedic shoes .
i can &apos;t believe i dress like a celebrity .
o @-@ okay , i get it now .
dr. jeffries , hello again . leonard hofstadter .
oh , oh , right , i remember your @-@ your girlfriend .
is @-@ is she ... is she here ?
no , she &apos;s not .
so , what prescription are you getting filled ?
sheldon .
wait , i want to guess .
don &apos;t tell me .
i wasn &apos;t going to tell you .
sheldon , come on .
no , no , no . i &apos;m really good at this .
all right , give me a hint .
does it involve difficulty initiating a stream of anything ?
well , given my age , that &apos;s more than just a lucky guess .
hey , sheldon , let &apos;s go mock the people
buying homeopathic medicine-- you love that .
but i &apos;m hanging out with my friend ,
and we &apos;re having fun .
look how happy he is .
bernie &apos;s having a girls &apos; night on friday at our place .
you want to do something ?
actually , i &apos;m busy .
doing what ?
there &apos;s a new sports bar over on colorado ave ...
you &apos;re going to girls &apos; night .
yeah .
you know they &apos;re making jewelry , right ?
you think they came up with that ?
they were going to drink beer and play darts .
what &apos;s up ?
not his testosterone levels .
excuse me .
i happen to be very comfortable with my masculinity .
how is that possible ?
hey , i got an email from professor proton .
goody ! what &apos;s it say ?
he &apos;s working on a paper about nano vacuum tubes ,
and wants to know if i &apos;d take a look at it .
that &apos;s strange .
that he would come to you for that and not me .
oh , i got two emails from him .
&quot; do you have leonard &apos;s email address ? &quot;
and ...
&quot; never mind , i found it . &quot;
i can &apos;t believe he picked you over me .
you don &apos;t want to read a paper by some old has @-@ been
who hasn &apos;t done any real science in decades .
yeah , it &apos;s nothing to cry about .
sheldon cooper does not cry .
it &apos;s true , you &apos;d rust .
and to think i idolized that man .
and why ?
at the end of the day he &apos;s just another hollywood phony .
is it really worth getting upset about ?
they say don &apos;t meet your heroes .
don &apos;t peek behind that curtain of fame and celebrity ,
because if you do , you &apos;ll see them as they really are--
degenerate carnival folk .
come on , he &apos;s a retired kids show host .
that &apos;s even worse .
using the sweet candy of science
to trick children into loving him .
pervert .
have you ever thought about
why arthur didn &apos;t want you to read his paper ?
yes , i have .
and my only conclusion
is the prescription he was picking up the other day
was for cuckoo pills .
maybe he found you , um , a bit much .
that &apos;s kind of a stretch .
look , when it comes to social skills ,
i &apos;ve mastered the big three .
there &apos;s the coy smile .
there &apos;s the friendly chuckle .
there &apos;s the vocalization of sympathy .
that last one &apos;s tricky , i &apos;m still working on it .
from what i saw the other day ,
i could understand why he and ...
some people might find you ...
what ?
doesn &apos;t matter .
no , go ahead , say it .
i know what it is .
i &apos;ve heard it my whole life .
the word &apos;s &quot; annoying . &quot;
go ahead , say it .
say it . say i &apos;m annoying .
sheldon ...
oh , it won &apos;t hurt my feelings .
go ahead , amy , say i &apos;m annoying .
i &apos;m annoying . i &apos;m annoying .
i &apos;m annoying . yeah , now , uh ...
now where are you going ?
look , you know you want to say it-- say it .
say i &apos;m annoying . go ahead , say it .
say it . say it . amy , say it .
well , she can &apos;t stand it when i &apos;m right .
this is fun .
i &apos;m going to feel like such a vixen wearing jewelry
that doesn &apos;t have a list of medications i &apos;m allergic to .
penny , how &apos;s it going over there ?
good-- i &apos;m just having little trouble with the glue .
how do you not know how to use glue ?
did you ditch pre @-@ school ?
yeah , but only because i was dating a second grader .
hello , everyone .
okay , let me have it .
let &apos;s hear all the &quot; raj is a girl &quot; jokes .
nope .
bernadette told me it isn &apos;t nice and i &apos;m not allowed .
thank you .
so i won &apos;t be making fun of you ,
or the things you like ,
or the fact that you just want to have fun .
howie , stop .
come on , look at what i &apos;m making .
oh , that &apos;s actually pretty nice .
i &apos;m making a bracelet .
yeah , i &apos;m just making a mess .
you know , instead of beads and glue ,
you guys can use my soldering iron .
you &apos;d be able to make much cooler stuff .
oh , i think we &apos;re doing just fine , thank you .
actually , i &apos;d kind of like to try that .
me , too .
be right back .
when did i have pistachios ?
arthur .
arthur .
arthur .
door knocker .
that &apos;s tv money .
sheldon , what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m sorry , did i wake you ?
of course you woke me , it &apos;s 7 : 30 .
well , i would have been here sooner ,
but for some reason your home
isn &apos;t on this map of hollywood stars .
what do you want , sheldon ?
it &apos;s been pointed out by my girlfriend
that i may have been annoying to you .
she sounds like a keeper .
anyway , i wanted to apologize .
i am truly sorry .
all right , apology accepted . have a nice night .
no , no , now that ... we &apos;ve cleared the air ,
i wanted to discuss another matter with you .
sheldon , in a couple hours , i have to get up ,
pee and then wander around the house .
well , then , i &apos;ll make this quick .
um , i want to talk about the paper you sent leonard .
now , i know he said it &apos;s promising
and he &apos;s going to collaborate on it ,
but now that you and i are friends again ,
i am at your disposal .
frankly , lending my name and reputation to it will help ,
because a lot of people think that you &apos;re a washed @-@ up has @-@ been .
or dead .
i should be so lucky .
so , uh , what do you say ?
you know , if it &apos;s all the same with you ,
i think i &apos;ll stick with leonard .
it &apos;s because i &apos;m annoying , right ?
i know it is . say it .
say it . say i &apos;m annoying .
good night .
say it .
arthur , say it . say i &apos;m annoying .
say it . say it .
i &apos;m annoying . say it .
you &apos;re annoying !
wow , that really hurt .
if you would have told me when i was a kid
that someday i would be doing science
next to professor proton ,
i would not have believed you .
if someone had told me
that people would still call me professor proton
when i was 83 years old ,
i never would have quit smoking .
i &apos;m sorry , dr. jeffries , i &apos;m just excited .
this nano vacuum tube idea of yours is really interesting .
hello , leonard .
oh , hello , arthur .
what an odd coincidence that you &apos;re both here .
why is it odd ?
because as it just so happens , i &apos;m also spending the day
with a beloved children &apos;s television science personality .
isn &apos;t that right , new friend and colleague ,
bill nye the science guy .
sorry , i replaced you with a newer model .
wow , arthur jeffries .
it &apos;s an honor to meet you .
my show never would have happened without yours .
that &apos;s what i told my lawyers .
mr. nye , hello .
i &apos;m sorry he got you involved in this nonsense .
he said i &apos;d be speaking to a class .
no , i said you were teaching someone a lesson .
now let &apos;s go .
what are you guys working on ?
oh , uh , we &apos;re making nano vacuum tubes .
that &apos;s interesting .
haven &apos;t you stolen enough from me ?
back off , bow tie !
hey , guys ...
what do you think ?
wow , penny , good job .
thanks . target , $ 4.99 .
i &apos;m getting a drink .
what are you working on ?
oh , i &apos;m making a necklace for my mom .
that &apos;s sweet .
yeah , she and my dad are going through
a bit of a rough patch , so
i wanted to do something to let her know
i was thinking about her .
what &apos;s going on with them ?
they &apos;re just having a little trouble communicating .
my dad says it &apos;s because the sound of my mom &apos;s voice
makes him want to tear his ears off
and sew them over his eyes
so he never has to look at her again .
hi .
hey , guys .
hello .
look who &apos;s here to put
the &quot; jew &quot; in &quot; jewelry night &quot; !
oh , sure , so it &apos;s fine when you say it .
sorry we &apos;re late .
i wanted to swing by the lab
and pick up some even cooler tools for us to use .
i didn &apos;t know you were coming again .
well , last week was a blast .
plus , i thought you might like having a guy here .
it was not funny .
so , what tools did you bring ?
everything we need to make jewelry molds .
here &apos;s some silver , a crucible
and an acetylene torch to melt it down .
ooh , that looks like fun .
maybe you should master glue
before you move on to fire .
okay , who &apos;s up first ?
rajesh , do you want to make a bracelet for your mom
to go with the necklace ?
no , thanks .
i was gonna make a necklace for my mom ,
but unfortunately , she doesn &apos;t have a neck .
she &apos;s just chins and fat and feet .
okay , we &apos;re almost ready to go .
once we bond the wires , we can test the tubes .
this is so exciting , i @-@ i feel ...
like i &apos;m 75 again .
oh , god .
what ... what is it ?
sheldon just sent me a picture
of him and bill nye getting smoothies .
can @-@ can i ask you a question ?
yeah , sure .
w @-@ why do you put up with sheldon ?
oh , uh , you know , because we &apos;re friends .
why ?
wow , you ask really hard questions .
yeah .
look , i @-@ i know he can be aggravating ,
but what you have to remember is that
he &apos;s not doing it on purpose .
it &apos;s just how he is .
but he &apos;s also loyal and trustworthy
and we have fun together ...
you ... you know you &apos;re describing a dog .
he did bite me once .
but in his defense ,
i came up behind him while he was eating , so ...
yeah , they @-@ they hate that .
you know what , sheldon is the smartest person i have ever met .
and he &apos;s a little broken and he needs me .
i guess i need him , too .
why @-@ why is that ?
boy , you will not let this go , will you ?
oh , geez .
another photo from sheldon ?
no , i have to go pick him up .
bill nye ditched him at the smoothie place .
he probably stole his wallet , too .
you know , if you guys are interested ,
there &apos;s a technique where i can take a lock of your hair ,
refine it into carbon dust ,
and use the hydraulic press at work
to turn it into a tiny little diamond
with your dna in it .
oh , that &apos;s amazing !
yeah . see bernie &apos;s engagement ring ?
that came right off my mom &apos;s back .
he &apos;s kidding .
if that were true , it &apos;d be so much bigger .
&quot; my name is howard .
i can make your hair into diamonds .
my mom is morbidly obese .
everybody love me . &quot;
whoa , where is that coming from ?
i &apos;ll tell you where it &apos;s coming from .
all you do is make fun of me for coming to girls &apos; night
and now you &apos;re here ruining it for everyone .
raj , cool it ...
he &apos;s gonna make us hair diamonds .
how am i ruining anything ?
i &apos;m just trying to help you make better jewelry .
but this isn &apos;t about the jewelry .
this is about me having a place
where i can open up about my feelings .
since when can &apos;t you open up with me ?
there are just some things
that i feel more comfortable sharing with the girls ,
because they won &apos;t make fun of me
or and call me names , or ask me if my
&quot; koothrapanties are in a bunch . &quot;
buddy , i was just joking around .
yeah , well , sometimes your jokes hurt .
well , you &apos;re right .
i didn &apos;t realize i was making you feel that way .
it was very brave of you to tell me .
thank you .
it wasn &apos;t easy .
they &apos;re gonna have sex before sheldon and i do ,
i know it .
arthur .
hi , sheldon .
i &apos;m surprised to see you here .
yeah , me , too .
somewhere around the third floor ,
i began to see a white light .
i &apos;ll get leonard .
no , no , no , i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m here ... i &apos;m here to see you .
if you &apos;re hoping to get in touch with bill nye ,
i can &apos;t help you .
i &apos;ve been informed that he &apos;s now
bill nye the restraining order guy .
no , i &apos;m ...
i @-@ i was thinking , if it isn &apos;t too much trouble ,
i &apos;d like to get your opinion about my @-@ my paper .
thank you .
it would be an honor .
oh . uh , great .
well , actually , i don &apos;t need that .
i hacked into your e @-@ mail account and read it .
and ... what did you think ?
well , first , i think the fact that
you use your birthday as a password
is embarrassing .
thank you .
second , um ...
i thought your paper was inspired .
oh , well , that ... that means a lot to me .
can i invite you in for tea ?
uh , no , no . i @-@ i really ...
i have ... i have to run .
hey , arthur . how are you ?
well , i guess one cup wouldn &apos;t hurt .
oh , hey , buddy , what &apos;s up ?
well , i was feeling bad about how i acted the other night
so i made you a little something .
you didn &apos;t have to do that .
well , it was fun .
i used some of the jewelry techniques you taught us .
it &apos;s a lightsaber belt buckle .
wow , this is so cool , thanks .
oh gets better .
and that &apos;s not even the best part . see ?
i have one , too .
check it out .
you can wear yours and we can have little sword fights
whenever we want .
yeah , and my eighth favorite episode of professor proton
was &quot; alka @-@ seltzer rocket . &quot;
you said , &quot; plop , plop , fizz , fizz ,
oh , what a blast @-@ off it is . &quot;
remember ? remember that ?
remember ?
he can &apos;t help it . he can &apos;t .
he really can &apos;t .
you wait here .
i &apos;ll get some alka @-@ seltzer ,
we can build that rocket ,
and we can shoot it at bill nye &apos;s house .
as long as i &apos;m not within 500 feet of it .
so , you , uh ...
you have ... you have any ...
single grandmothers ?
sorry , they &apos;re both married .
good .
h @-@ happily ?
