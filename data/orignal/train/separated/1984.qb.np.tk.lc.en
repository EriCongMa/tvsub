lucille .
hey , it &apos;s looking good .
tell me you got good news .
i do .
stable shelters &apos; bridge loan has just been approved .
harvey pulled some strings at the bank .
good to see you , harvey .
i figured you was allergic to manual labor .
i &apos;ll get my hands dirty if i have to , lucille .
but i believe charity begins at home .
yeah , and based on that rolex you wear ,
i &apos;d say that your favorite cause is doing pretty good .
we &apos;re gonna need your signature here .
15 % interest ?
they &apos;re worried about stable shelters &apos; solvency .
they &apos;re worried ?
they should try being executive director .
if you don &apos;t recover the money
that anthony mazlo embezzled from us ,
every one of these projects goes dark .
unless you got a spare room or two
for a couple thousand families in your condo .
i &apos;m not really a roommate kind of guy .
harvey &apos;s deposing elliot perkins , mazlo &apos;s number two ,
this afternoon .
perkins had to have knowledge of this ,
and he &apos;s going to give up his boss .
that &apos;s a promise . excuse me .
check it out . mazlo spent $ 500
a night on doggie daycare on his trip to greece .
greece .
what ?
oh , nothing .
tell me .
my first time was in greece .
my god , you &apos;re picturing that right now , aren &apos;t you ?
i have no choice . i &apos;m a visual person .
you two are really adorable .
we &apos;re 48 hours from trial ,
and you &apos;re gossiping like two 12 @-@ year @-@ olds at sleepaway camp .
listen up .
lucille jackson &apos;s not just the head of stable shelters , okay ?
she also sits on the board of directors
of several of our largest clients .
so if we lose this case ,
i doubt that her generosity &apos;s going to extend to us .
i would--
in my office .
bring the clarity drilling ipo .
jerome jensen &apos;s here . come on .
lucille &apos;s case is all hands on deck , harvey .
you can &apos;t just--
i can , and i am .
i thought we &apos;re working on this together .
yeah , we are , louis .
same way a golfer and his caddy work together .
be that as it may ,
we are deposing elliot perkins in 15 minutes , so--
perkins can wait .
just make sure that my 9 iron is nice and shiny when i get there .
okay ? come on , mike .
harvey .
jerome jensen , meet mike ross .
he &apos;s got the latest on the ipo .
hello , mike .
mr. jensen .
i &apos;m not here to talk about my business , harvey .
looks like my daughter might be getting into some trouble .
mildred wisnewski .
what &apos;s lola doing with a fake i.d. ?
well , that &apos;s what i hope you can find out .
it slipped out of her purse when she was ordering a drink
at a friend &apos;s bar mitzvah .
any idea what it &apos;s about ?
my relationship with lola &apos;s been rocky for a few years .
if i asked her , she &apos;d just lie .
truth is , i don &apos;t need to know .
i just need you to take care of it .
thank you .
what the hell is harvey doing ?
he &apos;s supposed to be deposing elliot perkins .
he &apos;s with a client .
i don &apos;t care . we have a deposition .
don &apos;t even try it , louis .
i &apos;m sorry .
let &apos;s--let &apos;s just start over . okay ?
hi , donna .
hi .
you know i like you , right ?
but in the firm &apos;s food chain ,
i am a humpback whale , and you are phytoplankton .
june 3 , 1997 .
that date means nothing to me .
doesn &apos;t it ?
who told you ?
is the important thing how i know
or that i know ?
does harvey know ?
he can .
i &apos;m going to pay you .
i just don &apos;t have cash on me right now .
so i &apos;m gonna just tell norma to run her old ass out to the atm
and then bring it back in a jiff , all right ?
i don &apos;t want your money , louis .
i just want you to--
i was not here . i was not here .
i was not here .
all right , let &apos;s get started , shall we ?
isn &apos;t harvey specter leading this deposition ?
he sent me .
now , mr. perkins ,
my first question to you is ...
do you sleep well at night ?
of course you do ,
&apos;cause you have a roof and a bed and running water ,
and by contrast ,
thousands of families are gonna be sleeping on the street
when stable shelters is forced to suspend their operations ,
all because of the money that you stole .
i never stole anything .
you &apos;re mazlo &apos;s number two .
money was embezzled . do you deny that ?
absolutely .
please , robert ,
i know as general counsel you just basically push paper ,
but will you please warn mr. perkins
about the penalties of perjury .
look , i &apos;m not aware of any perjury .
we know about your account in the caymans .
$ 20 million .
are you kidding me ?
that transaction was legitimate .
oh , when i take this public , you &apos;re gonna be disgraced .
your wife , your children , your whole family , disgraced .
would you show my client some respect--
and that transaction had nothing to do with the firm .
bullshit .
you either took your cut from mazlo , or it was hush money .
either way , you &apos;re gonna live the rest of your life
as a pariah , or you give up mazlo now .
is this a deposition or an inquisition ?
this is ridiculous . i can show you the records .
oh , sure you can . because you &apos;re the guy
who invented losses in mortgage @-@ backed securities
when you never even bought them .
i had no part in that .
but you were aware of it , and you did nothing about it .
come on , louis .
can i get a glass of water , please ?
you can &apos;t get any water . we don &apos;t have any .
you give up mazlo now , and this all stops .
all right , that &apos;s-- that &apos;s it .
my client needs a break .
we can continue this in ten minutes .
i &apos;m just getting started .
i don &apos;t get it . she looks so sweet .
don &apos;t let the photo fool you .
she &apos;s less &quot; girl next door &quot;
and more &quot; girl with the dragon tattoo . &quot;
look , my plate &apos;s full with stable shelters .
i need you to look into jerome &apos;s daughter .
why didn &apos;t you just hire a private investigator ?
because if there &apos;s a problem ,
an investigator can &apos;t fix it .
i &apos;m not just a lawyer to jerome , okay ?
i &apos;m--i &apos;m more like robert duvall in the godfather .
his consigliere .
okay .
what ?
uh , nothing .
just if you &apos;re his robert duvall ,
you &apos;re coming to me ,
so technically i &apos;m your robert duvall .
you &apos;re my fredo .
fredo ? no .
robert , what the hell happened to perkins ?
ask that pit bull of yours .
no , actually .
i prefer a female masseuse ?
if that-- can i call you right back ?
right back . okay , bye .
perkins just got wheeled out on stretcher .
well , he couldn &apos;t handle the heat .
he &apos;s probably faking it .
what were you thinking , starting that deposition without me ?
i don &apos;t know . maybe if you were doing your jo--
oh , no .
what ?
it &apos;s from geller . perkins wasn &apos;t faking anything .
our best chance to nail anthony mazlo &apos;s dead .
well , he blew off the deposition ,
so i was just picking up the slack .
i was letting perkins sweat .
it was a tactic , which you completely undermined .
i believe i made him sweat and then some .
are you actually proud of what you did ?
as far as i &apos;m concerned ,
whatever happened to that guy
was a result of his own guilt ,
and i will not apologize for deposing a criminal
in a vigorous manner .
losing perkins is a complication .
we &apos;re just gonna have to work harder
to unearth mazlo &apos;s money trail .
as for what happened ,
i &apos;ve spoken to the hospital ,
and cause of death was a pulmonary embolism .
it was nothing you did .
would it be okay if i took the credit ?
louis , i need to have a word with harvey .
okay .
financial crime is that man &apos;s forte .
yes , he overstepped his rank ,
but i &apos;m not about to throw the baby out with the bathwater .
louis is the bathwater .
believe it or not , harvey ,
you can be a real pain in the ass to work with too .
i get along with me just fine .
yes , well , i &apos;m not about to tell lucille jackson
that we didn &apos;t win because we couldn &apos;t work together .
you need to figure out how to collaborate with louis .
so the name on lola lensen &apos;s fake i.d.
wasn &apos;t just pulled from thin air .
belongs to an assistant controller at clarity drilling .
you &apos;re telling me this why ?
you wanted me to look into it .
i didn &apos;t ask you to explain the problem to me .
i asked you to fix it for me .
did louis really kill a guy ?
is that what the associate rumor mill &apos;s been churning out ?
actually , i think he started it .
he also claims that he &apos;s 6 &apos; 2 &quot;
with a full head of hair .
louis with hair . that &apos;s good .
how &apos;d you get past donna ?
you waited till she peed , didn &apos;t you ?
i mean , the woman retains water like a camel .
i see that the , uh ,
greatest band of all time is conspicuously absent .
and who would that be , louis ?
i don &apos;t know . a little british band called queen ?
should have seen that coming .
you know , real musicians ,
they don &apos;t wear eyeliner .
really ? why don &apos;t you tell that
to the artist formerly known as prince ,
who &apos;s ... once again named prince ?
what do you want , louis ?
i think now that we &apos;re working together ,
we should set some ground rules .
first rule , never touch my records .
or anything else in this office .
fine .
that includes the furniture .
i &apos;m trying to build a rapport with you .
okay ?
i mean , i think our relationship needs a little work .
let &apos;s hold off the couples counseling
until our fifth anniversary .
don &apos;t you think ?
look , mazlo &apos;s lawyer moved to push up the trial .
they know we need time to cultivate another witness .
i say we bluff .
i mean , perkins implicated mazlo
the minute his lawyer walked out of the room .
that &apos;s hearsay , louis .
not if it &apos;s a deathbed confession .
maybe while geller was making the 911 call ,
i had a little conversation with perkins .
so you want to lie about what perkins said
and how he said it ?
what &apos;s your brilliant solution , harvey ?
i &apos;m having the money
in perkins &apos; account traced as we speak ,
and i have another witness in mind .
i get anthony mazlo across that table ,
you know i &apos;ll break him .
the way you broke perkins ?
yeah . if need be .
you &apos;re not hearing me .
we need to hold off on any meeting .
i just wanna know why--
that &apos;s final , louis .
question . why would someone named lola jensen
ever want to be known as mildred wisnewski ?
who are you ?
my name &apos;s mike ross . i &apos;m a lawyer .
let me guess . pearson hardman ?
you know , forging a government document
like this after 911 is next to impossible .
god , there must have been a glitch at the dma .
why &apos;d you come here ?
your father came to us &apos; cause he &apos;s worried about you .
he &apos;s not worried . he &apos;d be here himself .
he wouldn &apos;t have sent an empty suit .
you don &apos;t know anything about me .
i , on the other hand , know that you used this i.d.
to funnel payments from clarity drilling
to some fake company that you set up .
locksley llc ?
you &apos;re stealing money from your father &apos;s company .
couple million so far .
i don &apos;t need to know why ,
but i do need you to return it . now .
actually , you do need to know why .
this is ground water
from clarity &apos;s fracking operation south of tulsa .
it &apos;s got elevated levels of dibutoxyethanol ,
methane , and benzene .
this compares samples taken pre @-@ drilling
to levels taken last week .
how did you get that ? that &apos;s classified company data .
let &apos;s just say i &apos;m good with computers .
wait a minute . locksley llc .
as in robin of locksley , as in robin hood .
these toxins are known to cause kidney failure ,
liver cancer , and infertility .
the epa fines were a slap on the wrist ,
but the settlement that your firm negotiated with the victims--
it doesn &apos;t matter how pure your motives are .
you &apos;re committing a very serious crime .
threaten all you want . okay ?
there &apos;s no way that my father &apos;s gonna let this go public
right before his ipo .
i &apos;m not giving the money back .
i &apos;m giving it away .
in terms of living relatives , i didn &apos;t find anything ,
but when i looked into the estates of relatives who passed away ,
e holding was originally in the name of the aunt .
your theory on perkins is right .
harvey , what are you doing ?
rachel &apos;s services are under my purview .
sorry . i &apos;m gonna change that .
anthony mazlo and his attorney are in the conference room .
at whose invitation ?
what , you think i called &apos; em ?
i--i didn &apos;t .
then mazlo feels he has an advantage .
and he &apos;s pressing it .
fellas .
thanks for meeting us on such short notice .
i figured you &apos;d be on a flight right now , mr. mazlo .
somewhere with no extradition agreement .
let &apos;s get to the point .
without perkins , you don &apos;t have a case .
this report summarizes an internal investigation we conducted .
what inez has just handed you
is hard evidence of fraudulent investments
and fake losses perpetrated by perkins .
guys have a real penchant for fiction , don &apos;t you ?
no , he duped all of us .
as ceo , he betrayed me
just as much as the investors .
we found an offshore account worth 20 million .
hold on a second .
lucille jackson trusts you to manage
a $ 150 million endowment .
perkins takes 20 . where the hell &apos;s the rest of it ?
in light of these findings ,
we &apos;d like to offer a settlement .
15 million .
ten cents on the dollar ? that &apos;s a slap in the face .
well , we advise all our clients that investments carry risk .
you want a risk @-@ free return , buy treasury bills ,
or , i don &apos;t know , hide your money under the mattress .
while you were writing the great american novel ,
i &apos;ve been checking facts .
the 20 million that perkins had overseas was legitimate .
he was innocent .
the money your firm embezzled is still out there ,
and this so @-@ called investigation
isn &apos;t worth the paper it &apos;s printed on .
well , lucille jackson may beg to differ , counselor .
a bridge loan means she &apos;s desperate .
our offer is non @-@ negotiable .
i won &apos;t accept this offer today or a year from now .
now since you &apos;ve all invited yourselves over ,
feel free to see yourselves out .
so first you attack me for wanting to lie about perkins ,
and then you turn around , do the same exact thing ?
i wasn &apos;t lying .
what are you saying to me ?
harvey , what the hell are you saying to me ?
that perkins had no involvement whatsoever ?
that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;m saying , louis .
he was innocent .
it &apos;s no surprise that mazlo low @-@ balled us .
i &apos;m just passing along this offer as a formality .
$ 15 million is not insignificant .
but now &apos;s not the time to settle .
we have to strengthen our hand .
all right , here &apos;s my problem .
best @-@ case scenario .
we go to trial , the jury awards us a settlement ,
obviously mazlo appeals that .
it &apos;s three years before i see any money ,
and my foundation &apos;s long gone by that point .
no , i &apos;m not gonna let mazlo
pocket the lion &apos;s share of your endowment .
i &apos;m not interested in a pyrrhic victory .
neither are we .
and to prove it , we &apos;re gonna forego our usual fee ,
and return to you the money you &apos;ve already paid .
i grew up sleeping in my mama &apos;s car .
and in and out of more halfway houses than i can count ,
and one thing i realized is that every penny matters .
so thank you .
what you gonna do ?
perkins may have been innocent ,
but he was still mazlo &apos;s direct report .
i &apos;m gonna find out what he knew .
your job is to verify every detail
of mazlo &apos;s internal investigation .
it is not about the crime now . it &apos;s about the cover @-@ up .
this says perkins acted alone .
well , he &apos;s the perfect scapegoat .
he can &apos;t defend himself .
you want to go to the bathroom ?
you don &apos;t bother coming back .
by the way , that goes for personal phone calls , emails , and texts .
i detect a whiff of slacking ,
you are done . get it ?
you find anything , i &apos;ll be in my office .
louis . uh , i &apos;m still working on harvey &apos;s case .
jerome jensen can go screw himself for all i care .
well , harvey explicitly told me--
i don &apos;t care if a burning bush told you , mike .
the only commandments you need to focus on right now
come from me .
there &apos;s something wrong with louis .
it &apos;s not my problem . i answer to harvey .
sitting home alone with your kids , with no job .
harvey .
you solve jerome &apos;s problem yet ?
uh , about to . but i need your corporate card first .
what for ?
well , i thought you didn &apos;t want me to explain it to you .
you &apos;re right . i don &apos;t .
okay .
it &apos;s killing you not knowing
what i &apos;m gonna use this for , isn &apos;t it ?
nope .
please let me tell you .
if you bring that back to me and it smells like stripper ,
you &apos;re fired .
i don &apos;t--i don &apos;t go to places like that .
you had to send someone ?
couldn &apos;t just call me ?
if you wanted this to be private ,
should have just robbed me .
you robbed the company , i had to involve other people .
okay . why don &apos;t we take a seat ?
why are you here ?
i want to tell you my side of things .
okay .
i &apos;m not proud of the fact that we contaminated people &apos;s water .
but we apologized .
we implemented safeguards .
we negotiated a payout that was more than generous .
if that &apos;s what you think , then you are lying to yourself .
i think that we could keep this civil--
no , she &apos;s right . it &apos;s true .
i am lying to myself .
i thought this was a phase ,
that it was hormones , that it would pass ,
but the truth is ...
i raised a thief .
okay , i think we &apos;re gonna need a minute . thank you .
a thief .
my research is making the planet more habitable , okay ?
you are making money destroying it .
you have no respect for me , that &apos;s fine .
but at least respect the workers .
you &apos;re stealing from them too .
you think i &apos;m such a criminal ?
arrest me .
so i organized this so that you two could clear the air ,
and it seems we &apos;ve gotten off the wrong foot ...
you know what ? it &apos;s the same story as always , dad .
you duck your responsibilities .
lo--lola .
what if i paid the company back with my own money ?
i don &apos;t think that would be a very good idea .
it would make you a conspirator .
i &apos;m not turning my daughter into the police .
this is not about the company image .
well , the good news is , she hasn &apos;t distributed the money--
the money is irrelevant .
i came to pearson hardman to take care of this .
instead , my daughter and i are further apart than ever .
i can &apos;t imagine how hard it is right now .
people are saying the most horrible things about elliot .
they must think i &apos;ve gone deaf .
anthony mazlo has been dragging your husband &apos;s name
through the mud to make him a scapegoat , mrs. perkins .
i &apos;m here to help .
i don &apos;t understand .
you work for the other side .
i work for a charitable organization that had all its money stolen .
i &apos;m on the other side of anthony mazlo ,
not your husband ,
and i don &apos;t want to see his memory painted with the same brush .
what would i have to do ?
this isn &apos;t the time or the place .
no , it &apos;s okay . what would i have to do ?
i &apos;d like to know everything
elliot has ever told you about mazlo .
any details would help .
ms perkins , uh , i &apos;m louis litt .
and i just want to let you know
that i &apos;m going to do whatever it takes to clear your husband &apos;s name .
his name ?
my husband would be alive today if it weren &apos;t for you .
well , we don &apos;t know that .
i know what happened in that room .
well , at the time , we didn &apos;t have all the facts ,
but now we do .
i can &apos;t believe that you have the audacity to come here .
i don &apos;t ever want to see your face again .
and you can forget about me helping you .
what the hell are you doing ?
i was deposing the widow , just like you .
i came here to pay my respects and initiate a relationship ,
not aggravate a grieving woman .
yeah , i brought flowers .
you just cost us a potential witness .
oh , really ?
well , maybe--maybe if you shared your game plan with me--
oh , the same way that you shared your game plan with me ?
how do you expect her to react to seeing you ?
you need to get your shit together and find us a new witness .
lola .
wanted to apologize for earlier today .
can i come in ?
uh , yeah . of course .
nice gesture . botanical gardens .
yeah , he said it was a pretty special place for you guys .
it was . and then he became ceo .
but i &apos;m not here to reminisce .
i must say i was , uh , really impressed
you figured out what i was doing .
especially since you &apos;re not even a real lawyer .
what--what are you talking about ?
i accessed harvard law school &apos;s alumni directory .
every class that graduated for the last ten years .
no record of mike ross . at all .
yeah , the dean &apos;s office was supposed to fix that .
they--they put my name wrong in the system .
i checked your social security number against the database .
how &apos;d you get my social security number ?
easily . here &apos;s the deal .
leave me alone , or i expose you .
you don &apos;t really seem that worried about this .
threats like hers are a tactic .
they &apos;re effective because they distract you
from what you &apos;re supposed to be doing .
are you crazy ?
what we should be doing is backing the hell off .
and how would that go , huh ?
&quot; jerome , you came to us with the problem , &quot;
&quot; we discovered that your daughter &quot;
&quot; stole $ 2 million from your company , &quot;
&quot; and our conclusion is you &apos;re shit out of luck &quot; ?
i don &apos;t really care how it would go .
all i care about is my life ,
and--and keeping our secret .
i told you , it &apos;s a distraction .
she won &apos;t pull that trigger .
why do you think she hasn &apos;t distributed that money yet ?
why do you think jerome doesn &apos;t want us to go to the police ?
i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s because they both want to bury the hatchet ,
and if any of that stuff happens , they can &apos;t .
then what ?
figure out a way to make them reconcile .
it &apos;s easy .
yeah . it &apos;s easy .
inez , right ? louis litt .
i know who you are .
so is this what you do for mazlo ?
you clean up his dirty laundry ?
leave me alone .
you know , you have your whole career ahead of you .
mazlo goes down and you &apos;re part of this cover @-@ up ,
no one &apos;s gonna hire you .
i can &apos;t help you .
listen , can i just tell you something , inez ?
in my experience , people respond to two things , okay ?
and that &apos;s the carrot and the stick .
now , i prefer the stick ,
and if you do not help me ,
i will devote my considerable expertise to sticking it to you .
the same way you stuck it to perkins .
inez , stop .
let &apos;s go with the carrot .
inez , harvey specter .
i appreciate you coming forward .
i should have done it sooner .
what changed ?
i can &apos;t be a part of a company like that anymore .
are you ready to testify against anthony mazlo
in open court ?
i am .
i assume you &apos;ve documented his malfeasance .
because otherwise it &apos;s he said , she said .
the entire paper trail .
from the beginning all the way to last week .
harvey asked me to fix this problem with lola ,
but i can &apos;t .
because your daughter &apos;s not the problem , mr. jensen .
you are .
are you trying to get fired ?
no . i &apos;m not .
i &apos;m your attorney .
it &apos;s my job to give you advice .
but you &apos;re her father .
it &apos;s your job to raise her .
now , you can go to another firm ,
but there &apos;s not a lawyer in the city
that can do that job for you .
please don &apos;t lecture me on parenting .
mr. jensen , i had a difficult relationship with my father ,
so trust me when i tell you that lola wants to forgive you ,
but she needs you to take the first step .
well , we tried it your way .
we went to lunch , and you saw how well that worked out .
my daughter &apos;s not a child .
she &apos;s an adult .
she made these choices as an adult .
if you just found a way ...
you &apos;re my lawyer . this is a legal problem .
my daughter brought this on herself .
now , i desperately do not want her to go to prison .
but if she doesn &apos;t return the money , she will .
where &apos;s mazlo ?
he was afraid to face us himself ?
what do you want ?
we know about your entire scheme .
what scheme ?
oh , the scheme where mazlo &apos;s laundering money through dubai .
how do you know about dubai ?
we cultivated another source .
what kind of settlement are you looking for ?
one that includes punitive damages .
send inez in here , please .
i don &apos;t think you &apos;ll find her at her desk .
why not ?
&apos;cause she agreed to testify for us .
i doubt that .
when your colleague approached her ,
she came straight to us .
he even tried to bribe me .
he said if i ratted out mr. mazlo ,
he &apos;d get me a job as an assistant to jessica pearson .
everything she told you is a complete fabrication .
there is no dubai .
i seem to recall you mentioning something
about penalties for perjury at our last meeting .
well , the penalty for bribing a witness is just as severe .
and we &apos;re willing to overlook that indiscretion
if you convince your client to take our settlement offer .
well , our revised settlement offer .
revised ?
yes .
exactly half of what it was before .
what the hell were you thinking ?
we needed a new witness .
you didn &apos;t think to look into her story ?
i don &apos;t know . did you look into it ?
you were the one who brought her in .
i assumed you had .
like any halfway decent lawyer would .
we were under the gun .
and i was under strict instructions from my golf pro
to get another witness .
no , i told you to get another witness ,
not bribe one .
that &apos;s enough .
as for the threat against louis ,
no money changed hands .
i &apos;m not concerned with louis .
he brought your name into it , okay ?
the offer was to be your assistant .
now you &apos;re exposed because of what he did .
is that true ?
she &apos;s an executive assistant to the head of a major investment firm .
she &apos;s not gonna work for a junior partner .
so you tried to bribe her .
no , it wasn &apos;t a bribe , jessica .
it was an incentive .
i thought she &apos;d be more likely to talk
if she wasn &apos;t worried about getting fired .
i want you to go to mazlo and take their offer .
i &apos;m not ready to do that .
i &apos;m not either .
i waived lucille &apos;s fee
because a certain senior partner
said we &apos;d never go to trial .
i said that before you stuck me with louis .
not the point .
she can &apos;t afford it , and neither can we .
give me time .
give it to me without louis ,
and we &apos;ll see who can afford it and who can &apos;t .
you have until the end of the day .
you come up empty ,
i &apos;m taking the offer to lucille myself .
jessica . i went to perkins--
not another word .
you try something like that again ,
and it will be your last day at this firm .
you said jerome wouldn &apos;t pull the trigger .
you were wrong . he &apos;s ready .
i don &apos;t have time for that right now .
harvey , when the police show up at lola &apos;s doorstep ,
we &apos;re done .
has she distributed the money yet ?
no , she hasn &apos;t , but she &apos;s--
she hasn &apos;t , and she won &apos;t ,
because what she wants is her daddy &apos;s attention .
now sit down with me , and let &apos;s deal with this .
yeah . yeah , sure .
why don &apos;t you tell me what you need ?
mazlo was in liechtenstein the day that
lucille &apos;s endowment evaporated .
maybe he was skiing .
nobody goes to liechtenstein for pleasure .
why don &apos;t we subpoena the bank records ?
how many banks can there be ?
place is like switzerland on steroids .
we &apos;ll never see those records .
so what the hell do you want from me , then ?
what did you just say to me ?
i once suggested that we hack harvard &apos;s records to cover my ass ,
and you laughed at me .
and now it turns out that you were wrong ,
and it &apos;s about to cost me my career .
where are you going ?
you told me to fix my case .
why don &apos;t you fix yours ?
hope you came here to tell me harvey &apos;s backing off .
i wish i could , but he &apos;s not .
that &apos;s too bad . had such a promising career .
oh , my god , lola ,
you act like you care about a higher cause ,
but of all the companies that exist , you chose your dad &apos;s .
company that &apos;s trying to make amends for what it did .
really don &apos;t need to hear another speech
from a wanna @-@ be suit .
god , you think i &apos;m your enemy , huh ?
well , i &apos;m not .
i didn &apos;t even come here to talk to you about me or your father .
new york . iowa . kansas .
40 states that all have housing projects that will vanish
if we don &apos;t find out information that only you can help us get .
so you can steal money from your father &apos;s company
or you can blow the whistle on me if you want to ,
but if you really care about people the way that you claim to ,
you &apos;re gonna do this first .
are we close ?
i &apos;m accessing the banks through a server in china .
unless you &apos;d rather me use yours .
take your time .
done .
all right , there &apos;s 16 banks in liechtenstein .
this is every account in every single one of them .
none of the accounts is listed under anthony mazlo .
forget about the name .
find an account with $ 150 million
embezzled from stable shelters on that day .
harvey , it &apos;s time .
unless you have something ,
i &apos;m calling lucille to settle .
jessica , you know how liechtenstein
doesn &apos;t respond to subpoenas ,
so i &apos;ve responded for them .
just trust me .
we &apos;ve got everything we need to find lucille &apos;s money .
it &apos;s not here .
sounds like you need more than just another minute .
you need another person .
someone whose expertise is financial crime .
no . no .
harvey , bring in louis .
or i &apos;m calling lucille .
donna , i need to talk to louis .
he &apos;s not in his office .
huh . norma wouldn &apos;t tell you where he is ?
well , she didn &apos;t , um ...
you didn &apos;t ask her , did you ?
she gives me the creeps .
ugh . you &apos;re such a wuss .
what did you just say to me ?
i think we both know what i just said .
norma , where is he ?
what ? you &apos;re kidding .
what ?
i come here when i need to be alone .
.44 magnum ?
really ?
feeling lucky today , punk ?
you know , i understand
that me pissing the bed on this case
must be really , really fun for you .
no . louis , it &apos;s not .
the one thing you and i have in common
is we need to win .
i noticed that .
i came here because , even after everything ,
we can win .
no .
i can watch while you win .
louis , i &apos;m not here to give you shit .
listen , i respect you .
i bribed a witness .
you incentivized her .
went to see perkins &apos; widow .
to apologize .
i killed a man .
that you thought had it coming .
i don &apos;t think you heard what i said .
i respect you .
you need my help .
i wouldn &apos;t phrase it exactly like that .
well , if you need my help ,
you better phrase it exactly like that .
okay . you want me to say it ?
i &apos;ll say it .
i &apos;m under the gun , and i need your help .
i &apos;ve got information ,
and you &apos;ve got the financial expertise to break this case .
now let &apos;s put the gun down and go get &apos; em .
okay .
first just stand over there .
don &apos;t push it .
so what was the exact amount of money
that was lost from stable shelters &apos; account ?
why ?
$ 152,375,242.18 .
i &apos;m good with numbers .
all right . what do you have ?
we &apos;ve compiled a printout of every account
that had a deposit made on the day in question
in all of liechtenstein &apos;s 16 banks .
okay . well , we are going to focus on , excuse me ...
these five banks .
how can you be sure ?
watch this .
these four banks have a history of capitulating to subpoenas .
so mazlo would know .
these six have u.s. corporate parents ,
which would expose their accounts to federal scrutiny .
once again , mazlo would know .
and then the one that he &apos;s got right there is low in reserves ,
therefore its solvency &apos;s in question ,
and there is no way in hell that mazlo would take his stolen money
and put it into some shaky bank .
so we can be sure .
every person who embezzles money ,
they do it in their own way .
but the one thing that they all have in common
is that they never put all their eggs in one basket .
so we are going to be looking at a combination of accounts .
across banks .
well , i mean , maybe across banks .
maybe the same bank .
but we &apos;re definitely looking at more than one account .
how do we figure out which accounts are his ?
because they &apos;re all gonna add up
to the same exact amount of money
that was lost from stable shelters &apos; account .
well , how do you know ?
when the account was drained , it had to go somewhere .
what goes out from lucille &apos;s had to go into mazlo &apos;s .
simple law of mathematics .
so we just have to figure out a combination of accounts
that adds up to ...
$ 152,375,242.18 .
i &apos;m good with numbers too .
thanks for meeting us on such short notice .
well , i assume you &apos;re ready to take our offer .
i rushed right down .
well , we just have a few questions
before we get to any of that .
we didn &apos;t agree to answer any questions .
no , no , robert , it &apos;s okay .
i &apos;m happy to play .
have you ever been to liechtenstein , mr. mazlo ?
you know , i &apos;ve been to many places .
among them , liechtenstein .
really ? well , of those many places ,
did you open seven different bank accounts ,
the amounts of which add up to exactly the same amount of money
that disappeared from lucille jackson &apos;s endowment fund ?
i doubt it . uh , what i don &apos;t doubt
is that if you trace the money that went into those accounts ,
you &apos;ll find that it came
from our corporate offices in sri lanka .
it &apos;s completely legitimate .
i mean , i &apos;m happy to show you the records , uh ,
whenever you &apos;d like .
that &apos;s great . isn &apos;t that great ?
well , after that , can you show us the records
of the seven safety deposit boxes
that you opened at those same banks the same day ?
i don &apos;t have to answer that .
this isn &apos;t a deposition .
you &apos;re so right . it &apos;s more of a presentation .
we could make it a deposition .
or trial .
up to you .
we have pictures of you entering those banks .
and we have enough to crack their subpoenas .
just a matter of time , tony .
all right . what do you want ?
what do i wa-- ? well , it &apos;s not about me .
it &apos;s about lucille .
she wants your head on a stick
but she &apos;ll settle
for her money back .
and your resignation .
we agree right here ,
no criminal prosecution ?
done .
if lucille doesn &apos;t get her money back today ,
nothing &apos;s done .
great . that &apos;s perfect .
you are back in business .
the wire transfer just went through .
girl , you came through .
that is what we do .
harvey . harvey , get in here .
lucille wants to thank you in person .
always got time for gratitude .
harvey , you didn &apos;t let me settle ,
and i appreciate your tenacity .
truth is , i didn &apos;t do this on my own .
have you met louis litt ?
you guys are doing such good work .
i just want you to know it .
have i told you how valuable you are to this company ?
&apos;cuz you &apos;re not . i &apos;m just kidding .
janice , i want you to take the rest of the day off
because you &apos;re so good . and i really mean it .
howard , 9 : 30 , tequila shots .
you and me . sharp . be there .
louis . luiz .
what &apos;s up ?
what were you just doing in there ?
what ? i was just ...
let me guess . you were cutting me out .
what are you talking about ?
the little impromptu meeting you just had with jessica and lucille
that you conveniently left me out of .
i didn &apos;t leave you out of anything .
i mean , i thought we were a team .
i thought this was the start of something ,
but i--
now i see the truth all too clearly .
louis , i was walking by ,
and they called me in .
yeah , just in time to take the credit for what i did .
i didn &apos;t do that .
wouldn &apos;t even think of doing that .
but you know what ?
you would , and that &apos;s your problem right there .
got your email about mazlo .
not a bad way for locksley llc to go out .
looks like the firm owes you one .
i think you owe me one .
is this ...
the real thing ?
yeah .
told the dean &apos;s office you &apos;d lost yours ,
and they were happy to oblige for one of their top graduates .
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;re awesome or terrifying .
also i added a layer of protection for you .
uh , the harvard law school alumni database ?
it &apos;s all there . your name , class rank ,
social security number .
you do realize you just made me party to a crime , right ?
can always call &apos; em up ,
report it as a glitch .
let me guess . untraceable .
i &apos;m not saying you won &apos;t get caught ,
but it won &apos;t be because your story doesn &apos;t check .
thank you .
seriously .
you &apos;re right .
working things out with my dad .
not the empty suit i thought you were .
who was that ?
uh , client &apos;s daughter .
really ? it &apos;s kind of late .
what &apos;s she doing at the office at this hour ?
you know , she was , uh , just thanking me .
thanking you .
mm @-@ hmm .
how &apos;d she do that ?
easily .
she bought me two tickets to greece .
not interested .
