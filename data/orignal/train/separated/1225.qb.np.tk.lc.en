what are those ?
ali was talking to somebody through the personal ads .
people turn on the microphone and anonymously record
any secret they want to with the understanding
that a stranger is gonna sit at this table
and listen to a random whisper .
tanner saw both of us there .
after she takes me down , she can go after you , too ,
and it will be all my fault .
ashley , will you marry me ?
andrew ?
is there something going on between you two ?
he &apos;s helping me study .
alison was offered a plea bargain .
part of the deal was to name her accomplice .
we were afraid she might name you .
hanna &apos;s been arrested .
tanner found the clothes mona was wearing the day she died
and hanna &apos;s blood was on them .
i &apos;m not taking the plea .
you will be here , prosecution there .
don &apos;t be afraid to look at the jury .
we don &apos;t want them to think you have anything to hide .
i don &apos;t like the idea of 12 strangers off the street
deciding what happens to my daughter .
it &apos;s the american way .
they know nothing about me .
if i could just tell them the whole story ...
alison , we &apos;ve discussed this before .
the key to winning this case isn &apos;t telling the jury
desperate stories about being plotted against .
our job is to prevent the prosecutor from proving his case .
right now , he has the tougher job .
why ?
he has to convince 12 jurors
beyond a reasonable doubt that alison killed mona .
all we have to do is make one of them unsure .
one of them ?
that &apos;s all it takes .
opening statements in alison &apos;s trial begin at 9 a.m.
i &apos;m gonna be there .
i &apos;m not sure that &apos;s a good idea .
i &apos;m going .
if something happens that effects you ,
i don &apos;t want to hear about it second hand .
someone is doing this to me .
you understand that , right ?
and i think we know who that somebody is .
i told you it &apos;s not ali .
alison dilaurentis is capable of anything .
i &apos;ve experienced that firsthand .
but you can &apos;t be certain .
certain enough .
hanna , if you know anything about her ,
now is the time to speak up while it can still help you .
do anything to save myself ?
what part of scripture is that from ?
this is about telling the truth , hanna .
i am telling the truth .
i didn &apos;t do anything and ali didn &apos;t do anything either .
i don &apos;t care about the truth !
i care about getting my daughter out of this place .
that is all i care about .
you see , if my head hadn &apos;t have been so jet @-@ laggy ,
i would have remembered it sooner .
the number off of the varjack receipt
is the same number as the personal ads in ali &apos;s house .
how does this help hanna ?
well , if ali &apos;s not guilty ,
then they can &apos;t charge hanna as an accessory .
you can &apos;t help someone commit a crime
that they didn &apos;t commit .
but ali already told us that the letter
and the passport are fake .
why do we think the number and the ads are real ?
i don &apos;t know .
but we didn &apos;t find the number with the other things .
so what if the numbers are the same ,
what does that mean ?
you know , we call it and it just rings ,
no pick up , no voice mail , nothing .
yeah , and meanwhile neilan &apos;s law office is closed and locked .
but the number appearing twice ...
it &apos;s got to mean something , we just have to figure it out .
what if we don &apos;t figure it out in time ?
the three of you are gonna be late for school .
uh , no , mom , teacher &apos;s conference .
they dropped the first two periods .
i told you .
oh , then , uh , this is my chance to talk to all of you .
i want to strongly suggest that you girls stay away
from alison &apos;s trial .
this is a suggestion ?
for emily and aria , yes ,
for you it &apos;s more than a suggestion .
what is ali gonna think if we &apos;re not there ?
i &apos;m more concerned about what other people will think .
juries have eyes .
the whole town knows that we &apos;re friends with her .
yeah , if we don &apos;t go , it &apos;ll be like saying
we think she &apos;s guilty .
i can &apos;t tell you and emily what to do ,
but consider your actions .
okay , so what are we gonna do when hanna goes to trial ?
are we just supposed to turn our backs on her too ?
we &apos;re not talking about ethics .
that &apos;s for sure .
maybe we should go .
yeah .
spencer ,
i want you to promise me
you won &apos;t go near that courtroom .
everything i &apos;ve tried to trace this number back to a source
just disappears into a black hole of nothingness .
no tagged id , no localizing signature ,
the phone on the other end could be on mars
or on the other side of this room .
an insanely secure phone and somebody uses it to order pizza ?
maybe they don &apos;t know what they have .
then why don &apos;t they pick up when we call ?
do you have a burner phone ?
what color ?
it &apos;s just gonna keep ringing .
well , let &apos;s see what happens when i put it in writing .
holly golightly or holly varjack ?
send it .
what if we &apos;re not on the same book club ?
then we &apos;ll figure out something else ?
ali &apos;s running out of time .
and so is hanna .
i know .
spence , are you gonna be there tomorrow at the trial ?
i don &apos;t know .
listen , you guys , i have to go do something .
so i &apos;ll talk to you all later .
sure .
are you gonna be visiting hanna today ?
tomorrow , but she said she &apos;ll try to call me today .
she has to get to ali and ask about the phone number .
jason .
hello , spencer .
i left you messages .
i know .
we need to talk .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s such a good idea .
jason ...
we &apos;ve pretty much exhausted anything
that we have to say to each other .
you need to listen to me , okay ?
no , i don &apos;t .
i did listen to you and now they have me down
as a prosecution witness .
i &apos;m sorry .
oh , you &apos;re sorry ?
good .
please , we need to talk about how ali isn &apos;t guilty .
get in the car , jason .
please !
get in the car now !
mr. dilaurentis , i just want to talk to jason .
i &apos;m not interested in what you want .
what you want doesn &apos;t help alison .
we &apos;re neighbors at least for the moment .
in case you forgot , your house is the one
with the big gate and the wall .
stay on the other side of it .
you &apos;ve been hard to find .
i know . i &apos;m sorry , i meant to text you back
but there &apos;s this ...
you know , there &apos;s-- there &apos;s a lot going on right now .
i know .
how &apos;d it go ?
the test .
am i a successful tutor ?
very successful .
good .
how &apos;s mike ?
he &apos;s okay , i guess .
he &apos;s up in harrisburg with his lacrosse team .
they &apos;re turning it into a field trip .
but i &apos;m just kind of glad he &apos;s out of town
to keep his mind off , you know ...
the trial ?
yeah , the trial .
it &apos;s happening fast , isn &apos;t it ?
that &apos;s how mr. dilaurentis wanted it .
no motions , no delays .
i guess he thinks that &apos;s best for alison .
i guess so .
anyway , how are you ?
me ? fine .
i &apos;m getting a little tired of memorializing mona .
mrs. horowitz keeps talking about her .
she &apos;s just trying to understand what happened
like the rest of us .
i suppose .
looks like she &apos;s ready to nominate mona for sainthood .
our best scholar ,
our martyred hero ,
like she won every championship on her own .
i guess she was a pretty aggressive competitor .
not aggressive , vicious .
i &apos;ve seen her intellectually kneecap dozens of kids ,
and the only thing mona likes better than winning
is taking the credit .
we &apos;re lucky she didn &apos;t get to college
and start thinking about running for president .
are you saying that the world &apos;s better off without her ?
i &apos;m just saying there are other people on this team .
hello ?
this call is from the chester women &apos;s correctional facility .
you have a call
from inmate alison dilaurentis .
to accept this call , press 1 .
hello , ali .
hello , emily .
you okay ?
never better .
you &apos;ll be fine .
really ?
what makes you say that ?
i &apos;m sorry .
no , i &apos;m sorry .
i didn &apos;t call to say that .
i just ...
listen , tomorrow , will you be there ?
i &apos;ll try .
you &apos;ll try ?
i &apos;ll be there .
thank you .
somebody said it was raining .
is it raining back home ?
yes , it &apos;s-- it &apos;s raining .
good night , em .
good night , ali .
remember high school ?
remember when every hallway slight was like an assault ?
when allegiances and enemies
were magnified out of all proportion ?
it is a world where a perceived opponent
must be dealt with quickly ,
without remorse .
and that is what alison dilaurentis did
to mona vanderwaal .
miss marcus will be up here shortly
and she is going to tell you an amazing story
about alison dilaurentis .
how she was kidnapped and traumatized
by two years of captivity .
how she escaped her captors and returned home ,
helped by her closest friends .
it is a remarkable story .
it &apos;s breathtaking .
none of it happened .
it &apos;s a fairy tale .
the commonwealth will prove ,
with direct testimony of witnesses ,
that alison dilaurentis &apos; epic tale
of abduction and escape is a lie .
it is a lie created by her
and perpetuated by the friends that helped to &quot; save &quot; her .
mona vanderwaal knew the truth .
she had the power to destroy the fantasy created by alison
and maintained with her little group of followers .
and that is why alison dilaurentis
planned and carried out the murder of mona vanderwaal ,
consigning her to a cruel , anonymous end .
they know about ali not being kidnapped .
they probably know about new york too .
how could they know ?
witnesses .
spencer , he said they &apos;ve got witnesses .
cyrus .
cyrus ?
what about cyrus ?
the cops must have found cyrus .
he knows the whole kidnapping story
and he &apos;d do anything to save himself .
aria , where &apos;s mike ?
he &apos;s in harrisburg .
good .
good ?
what do you mean good ? why is that good ?
you knew about this .
you all knew and you told the police .
this isn &apos;t going to solve the problem , mr. dilaurentis .
you talked her into it , that &apos;s what happened .
the four of you talked her into this .
it was your idea .
dad , ali lied to them the same as she lied to us .
jason , you don &apos;t know--
not here , gentlemen .
you heard all that ?
yeah , i heard .
they adjourned for the day
but we &apos;ll call if anything else happens .
okay .
the personal ads are real .
the ads are real but the passport is fake .
how does that work ?
somebody planted them ,
but i hid things in the house too .
everybody hides things , hanna .
and the phone number spencer found ?
that &apos;s real .
who were you talking to ?
not talking , texting .
when my mother was killed ,
somebody bought a tribute out in the paper .
all it said was &quot; goodnight , light &quot; and the red balloon
and a response number , a code the papers use .
&quot; goodnight light . &quot;
i know that &apos;s from a book .
my mother used to read that to me when i was a baby .
well , who would know that ?
that &apos;s what i was trying to find out .
so i answered and 2 days later
another ad , &quot; goodnight nobody , goodnight brush . &quot;
&quot; goodnight to the old lady whispering hush . &quot;
and then a phone number , i sent a text .
why didn &apos;t you tell us you were doing this ?
you &apos;ve been talking to &quot; a &quot; and you never said a word .
aria killed shana in new york .
okay , my mother was buried in spencer &apos;s backyard .
i was afraid that you were gonna get hurt .
whoever it was ,
said they knew who killed my mother .
they were just torturing me .
it wasn &apos;t &quot; a , &quot; it was mona .
how are you so sure it was mona ?
the only thing i know for sure is
that the texts stopped when mona was killed .
emily and aria were at the courthouse today .
well , whoever told you that must have told you
that i wasn &apos;t there with them .
did you know what was gonna happen ?
i heard .
too late to do anything about it .
too late to do anything except to warn me not to be there ?
maybe now you understand why i did that .
i &apos;m still trying to understand why you and melissa lied to me
and tried to keep me from coming back
when my friends needed me ?
someone will be going to prison for a very long time .
my only concern is that it &apos;s not going to be you .
don &apos;t you want to ask me
if i knew about ali &apos;s fake kidnapping ?
no .
because i &apos;m telling you , you didn &apos;t .
all that time she was talking to somebody about her mother ,
she never told you ?
she thinks it was mona .
ali is scared .
she &apos;s trying to be brave
but i can see something running around inside her ,
behind her eyes .
is there anything running around behind your eyes ?
oh , yeah , snakes , spiders , flying monkeys ...
nothing i can &apos;t handle .
we &apos;re gonna get you out of here ...
i promise .
be careful what you promise .
hanna .
i &apos;m starting to think that this isn &apos;t gonna work out
the way we want it to .
you can &apos;t think like that .
we will figure this out .
even if we figure this out , no one is gonna believe us .
i wouldn &apos;t believe the story that &apos;s happening to me .
you can &apos;t lose hope .
the thing i hope for is for you to stay safe .
that &apos;s the only promise i want you to make .
if things get worse , i want you to find a way out .
what do you mean out ?
out , away , gone .
i want you to get on a plane or a boat
and go somewhere where they can &apos;t find you .
caleb , i can manage as long as you &apos;re safe .
well , i &apos;m not gonna do that .
well , that &apos;s what i want you to do .
promise me .
well , is the phone number a dead end or not ?
what if it &apos;s mona &apos;s and it &apos;s a dead end ?
mona is dead , so who is the lawyer talking to ?
i mean , he had to be getting his instructions from someone .
you okay ?
yeah .
aria .
it &apos;s the number .
look , it &apos;s the varjack number .
answer it .
why does it have my number ?
i never called from my phone .
answer it quick .
they don &apos;t know we &apos;re here .
we don &apos;t have time for this .
hello ?
who is it ?
are you getting this ?
i &apos;m getting it .
we don &apos;t know what it means .
i know what it means .
i mean , i don &apos;t know but i &apos;ve heard it before .
where ?
in mona &apos;s room .
she used to play this song ,
french music from people like edith pilaf .
like the rice dish ?
piaf , edith piaf .
ali was wrong .
it was never mona taunting her , it was &quot; a. &quot;
then why call back and play that song ?
why not let us keep thinking it was mona ?
to rub it in our faces .
well , mona never sent that lawyer ,
but that doesn &apos;t mean she left us in the dark .
she hid the tape hanna found in that book .
the police went all over that room
and they never found it .
so ?
so maybe there &apos;s more .
maybe the answer is just still in that room .
we have to get back to mona &apos;s room .
hanna , you spent more time in that room than any of us ,
so try to think about places
that mona would have hid stuff .
okay .
we need to talk to mona &apos;s mom .
but she wasn &apos;t at the trial .
it &apos;s got to be hard to hear
people talk about your dead daughter .
guys , if there &apos;s something in that room
that can get me out of here ,
i don &apos;t care how upset she is , just find it .
we &apos;ll do it .
that &apos;s me . they &apos;re gonna cut me off .
hang on .
hanna , stay strong . we love you .
here .
sorry for grabbing it from you .
it &apos;s okay .
no , it &apos;s not .
if we start stepping on each other ,
none of us are gonna make it out alive .
should we go see mona &apos;s mom ?
not all at once .
that &apos;s just gonna scare her .
i &apos;ll go do it .
well , i &apos;m the least intimidating .
i &apos;ll drive you .
spence .
i &apos;ll call you guys later .
okay .
i should have put hanna in a car
and taken off when i had the chance .
why didn &apos;t you ?
she would never leave you and aria and em .
you guys are like a band of vikings .
well , less pillaging , better hygiene .
she told me to get out before it got too late .
she said it to me but i think that she meant it
for all of us .
do you have any idea how hard that must have been for her
to say that to you ?
the point is she said it .
are you thinking about it ?
no .
you know , when all of this is over
and we are safe and sound ,
i need to talk about bottling you .
&quot; essence of best boyfriend , &quot; we &apos;re gonna make a fortune .
have you talked to toby since you got back ?
it &apos;s not really a good idea under the circumstances .
finish your cookie .
no answer .
do you really think there &apos;s something up there ,
or are we just chasing smoke ?
i don &apos;t know .
but whatever mona was , she wasn &apos;t stupid .
so if she knew what might happen ,
she could have left us a clue .
if , might , could .
that &apos;s all we &apos;ve got .
well , what if it &apos;s not enough ?
we &apos;re running out of time , we &apos;re all gonna get
dragged down the rabbit hole with ali .
do you want to just give up and go shopping ?
not just yet .
hi .
hi .
just wanted to apologize for earlier ,
about my dad outside the office .
that &apos;s okay .
still a pretty clear path through there
between our houses .
yeah , well there &apos;s been a lot of traffic over the years .
guess that &apos;s how you knew she &apos;d come this way when she ran .
is that how you trapped her for the police ?
i really wish that we hadn &apos;t .
i let her go .
i let her run away .
why do you think i did that ?
maybe you thought there was a chance
she was telling the truth .
that &apos;s a funny thing for you to say .
jason , i made a terrible mistake .
no , i made the mistake , spencer .
i listened to you .
i don &apos;t think this is gonna come as any surprise to you , ,
but i can be really certain about things .
not a surprise .
i like being certain .
okay , it &apos;s where i &apos;m comfortable .
i @-@ i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m not happy in the grey places ,
so sometimesre i go to the shore
when i know that i shouldn &apos;t .
and there &apos;s somebody out there
who knows that about me , and they &apos;re doing a very good job
of using it against me .
nobody likes the grey places .
i don &apos;t think alison killed anybody .
jason ?
i got a call from the prosecutor &apos;s office .
they &apos;re shuffling the witness list .
i &apos;m testifying tomorrow .
if i hadn &apos;t stopped to write this ,
i would have been able to make a clean getaway .
where do you think you &apos;re going ?
mom , i &apos;m going to alison &apos;s trial .
i forbid it .
forbid ?
that &apos;s a big hefty 19th century word .
spencer , please , don &apos;t go .
i &apos;m sorry .
i can &apos;t do what you &apos;re asking me to do , i have to go .
if they see you there ...
if people are gonna talk about me ,
i &apos;m not gonna let them do it behind my back .
and being afraid isn &apos;t going to make things better .
is this the video the police showed you ?
yes .
after you saw it , did you tell the police
of your sister alison &apos;s whereabouts
on the day that mona vanderwaal was attacked ?
i said that she wasn &apos;t with us .
why have you decided to tell the truth about alison &apos;s alibi ?
i don &apos;t know .
was it because of something you saw on the video ?
i don &apos;t think so .
something &apos;s wrong .
he &apos;s changing his story .
didn &apos;t you tell detective tanner
that you thought the attacker in the video was alison ?
i might have said that , yes ,
but i don &apos;t believe that now .
you told police ...
i &apos;ve been thinking and i &apos;m sure
that couldn &apos;t have been alison .
mr. dilaurentis ...
do you know a girl named hanna marin ?
objection .
irrelevant .
where are we going , mr. sirk ?
your honor , the witness has confirmed
that the defendant doesn &apos;t have an alibi .
that &apos;s fact .
i would like the jury to understand
what may have influenced his identification of the attacker .
counselor ?
your honor , if mr. sirk wants to cross @-@ examine
his own witness , i have no objection .
proceed .
do you know hanna marin ?
yes .
is she a friend of your sister alison ?
yes .
who is ashley marin ?
hanna &apos;s mother .
objection . irrelevant .
goes to foundation .
overruled .
but don &apos;t take the scenic route , mr. sirk .
is mrs. marin in the courtroom today ?
yes .
point her out to the jury , please .
she &apos;s in the third row .
she &apos;s wearing a blue dress .
does mrs. marin work for you ?
she did , she doesn &apos;t anymore .
did you have occasion to meet with her outside of the office ?
yes .
socially ?
yes .
how many times have you been with her socially ?
that &apos;s ...
i didn &apos;t count .
these social meetings ,
were they always in public places ?
most of them .
but not all of them .
some were in private .
yes .
is he saying what i think he &apos;s saying ?
how would you characterize these private meetings ?
seriously ?
sorry , i don &apos;t think i understand the question .
well , would you describe them as intimate ?
they were private .
did anything happen during these private meetings
with the attractive woman seated in the gallery
that led you to alter your testimony ?
no .
did ashley marin , the mother of someone accused
as an accomplice to this crime ,
offer any personal inducement to you
to change your testimony to favor the defense ?
objection . asked and answered .
sustained . move on , mr. sirk .
last chance , mr. dilaurentis .
do you want to clear this up ,
or leave it to the jury &apos;s imagination ?
objection .
improper , inflammatory , irrelevant .
sustained .
do you have any other questions for this witness ?
nothing further .
do you think hanna knew about this ?
she did .
and it looks like &quot; a &quot; knew about it , too .
well , what happened in there hurt ali , didn &apos;t it ?
yeah . it made it sound like her own brother thinks she did it .
until hanna &apos;s mom convinced him to change his story .
do you think that &apos;s what she did ?
hanna &apos;s mom ?
hold on .
jason ?
are you all right ?
ask me after i find a place to sleep tonight .
you and hanna &apos;s mom ...
it &apos;s none of your business , spencer .
it &apos;s nobody &apos;s business .
no , you &apos;re right .
it &apos;s not .
if you really need a place to stay ...
it &apos;s okay .
i &apos;ll figure something out .
cross your fingers and wish hard
that you never have to sit in that chair .
you won &apos;t like it .
what did he say ?
the truth will set you free
but first it turns you inside out .
come on .
where ?
mona &apos;s house .
well , you were right .
i shouldn &apos;t have gone to the trial .
i don &apos;t think it would have made much of a difference
if you &apos;d stayed away .
you might as well start answering that .
it can keep .
you &apos;re gonna have to talk to someone sooner or later .
if they haven &apos;t heard already ,
they &apos;re going to hear it on the news .
most of the ladies in the congregation
manage to pull the news straight out of the atmosphere .
it &apos;s really amazing .
you can go , ted .
i just want to finish my coffee first .
no , i mean ...
you can go .
it &apos;s all right .
i &apos;m not going anywhere .
i &apos;m not being noble , i &apos;m being practical .
i made a promise to you .
and believe me , there is a time
when i would have held you to that but ...
not now .
it &apos;s not a way to start a life together .
we can get through this .
yes , we can .
and then what ?
we are who we are , ted .
i never asked you to explain .
you should have .
what &apos;s the point of forgiveness if you don &apos;t know
what really happened ?
it &apos;s about a clean slate .
there is no such thing .
i &apos;m beginning to think that &apos;s the way
it was supposed to be .
thank you .
but you should go .
i &apos;ll just finish my coffee .
okay ?
do you think she &apos;s in there ?
mrs. vanderwaal !
okay , she &apos;s not here , she wasn &apos;t at the trial , where is she ?
she &apos;s hiding .
i don &apos;t blame her .
okay , it was a long shot .
long shots are all we have .
we should try and get to hanna .
well , it was a good idea .
&quot; finders keepers , losers weepers . &quot;
quelle tristesse .
&quot; a. &quot;
your accent &apos;s getting better .
wait .
what ?
how would you stop someone from searching your room ?
what do you mean ?
why do we think that &quot; a &quot; found something
just because &quot; a &quot; said so ?
the note was written to taunt us .
or trick us .
think like mona .
just for a minute .
if i were mona ...
what the hell is a chandelier ritual ?
i have no idea .
let me change , i think better in lower heels .
okay .
aria ?
i didn &apos;t want you getting the wrong idea .
about what ?
i &apos;ve been thinking , and i realize
i made a really bad impression what i said about mona .
look .
everything about mona was complicated .
yeah . but when i said that about her ,
i saw the look on your face .
and it wasn &apos;t the way i want to see you look at me ...
ever .
it &apos;s just my face .
sometimes it does things without checking with me first .
well , it sounded like
she deserved what happened to her ,
and i don &apos;t believe that .
yeah . nobody does .
it was bothering me .
just wanted to make sure we &apos;re clear on this .
yeah , we &apos;re clear .
and if you need me for anything ,
cramming for an exam
or driving out to some road house ,
you &apos;ve got me on speed dial , right ?
yeah . right .
okay . i feel better .
i guess i surprised your face again , huh ?
it &apos;s okay . i &apos;ll call you .
okay .
i &apos;m sorry .
this is all my fault .
i &apos;m the one who should be saying sorry .
for what ?
for being human ?
i &apos;m sorry i gave you such a hard time .
awful lot of mistakes , hanna .
i have made so many mistakes .
it &apos;ll be okay .
whatever happens , we &apos;ll be okay .
i &apos;m supposed to be saying that to you .
it &apos;s not gonna be that bad .
i mean , maybe i &apos;ll write a book or something .
lots of people write books in prison .
martha stewart wrote one .
i just hope you didn &apos;t get the bad decision gene from me .
well , i hope i did .
i hope i got all of your dna in me .
that means i &apos;ll be smart and i &apos;ll be brave
and i &apos;ll sing my daughter
the best lullabies when she &apos;s scared .
do you know how much i love you ?
yeah , i think i do .
we &apos;re quite the pair .
all lying is a one way street .
it &apos;s kind of like those signs in parking lots .
&quot; backing up causes severe tire damage . &quot;
what does your lawyer think ?
she remains confident ,
except when she doesn &apos;t know that i &apos;m looking at her .
is there anything i can do ?
you had the right idea a long time ago .
get out .
just leave , jason .
do it now .
i believe you , ali .
i believed you since that night at the house
when you tried to get away .
i saw it in your face , you didn &apos;t kill anyone .
no .
but i let a lot of things happen that i shouldn &apos;t have .
i took money from my mom &apos;s purse
and she thought it was my brother
and that &apos;s who got punished .
this was 20 , 25 years ago .
the broken headlight ,
i did that , i think .
i don &apos;t remember much of that night .
oh , i hate my boobs ,
they &apos;re like a complete joke .
the dog didn &apos;t run away ,
i left the gate open on purpose .
