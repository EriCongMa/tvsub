and that &apos;s how paleolithic hunting tribe
overtook early agricultural civilization .
ah . that &apos;s an interesting answer , miss edison .
is it right ?
don &apos;t know . don &apos;t care .
but so far , you &apos;re all getting as .
you &apos;re welcome .
are you sure everyone should get as ?
it seems a little unfair to the people
that actually studied .
throw paper balls at her head until she sits down .
oh ! what ? oh .
sitting . i &apos;m sitting .
good . very good .
a @-@ pluses for all of you .
professor duncan , you are such a great teacher
when you &apos;re drinking .
thank you , darrell .
it &apos;s troy .
hey , the man wants to give darrell an &quot; a , &quot;
let him do it .
nice shot .
oh , thanks .
a toast to the easiest school , the dumbest dean ...
and the ultimate blow off class .
anthropology . who knew ?
hey , shirley .
hmm ?
you &apos;re not drinking .
someone is cruising for an a @-@ minus .
oh , no , no , i &apos;m with child .
well , if it &apos;s my child ,
it &apos;s okay to have a drink or two .
chang babies love the sauce , you know ?
alcohol and duck .
zoink .
this is not your child , chang .
it &apos;s andre &apos;s .
how do you know ?
because i don &apos;t see any locusts .
besides , a woman knows these things .
women have a connectedness to their bodies
that you would never understand .
you have a booger .
i know . it &apos;s part of me .
hey . can we please do the exam ?
question number two :
how awesome is it that this class is fake ?
here is to never telling the dean .
and that is what jews do at weddings .
anthropology !
l &apos;chaim !
第二季 第二十二集
oh , professor duncan , class ,
this is mr. jacobson .
he &apos;s a writer who &apos;s doing a piece on me
for dean magazine .
ah !
i know , right ?
well , keep taking your exam .
don &apos;t let my presence distract you .
i &apos;m sort of a father figure to the kids around here
for my &quot; outside the box &quot; approach to education .
you know , like that film children of the corn .
oh , professor .
what ?
proceed .
yes .
the anthropology final .
do you know what , i have left the exam paper in my office .
but it is a real doozy .
there is an interactive element .
a performance component .
and i don &apos;t want to tip it ,
but there may be a lump of clay coming to everyone in the room .
so , uh , toodle @-@ oo . cheerio .
wowee . this is a real college .
so after this ,
we should check out the world food festival
in the parking lot .
no way .
there are lunch trucks with
18 different nationalities of food .
you know what , not different . equal . equal to whites .
you know what , better than whites .
oh , i think that sounds
like an awesome thing to do immediately .
i bet the reader of dean magazine would love it .
i &apos;m good .
i &apos;d like to stay here and check out this unorthodox exam .
shirley , you okay ?
uh @-@ huh .
just a little indigestion .
i &apos;ve been having it all morning .
are you sure it isn &apos;t contractions ?
no , no , no . it &apos;s way too early for any of that .
um , my other two came right on schedule .
maybe even a little late .
jordan was in here so long ,
he came out with a driver &apos;s license .
i &apos;m kidding . that &apos;s not true . ooh .
chang babies are always premature .
we gestate fast because we &apos;re better at obtaining nutrients .
some need only eight months ,
depending on how much of the mother they eat .
oh , uh , shirley , that is full of chemicals .
i wouldn &apos;t expose your baby to that .
actually , my doctor said antacid is safe to take .
yeah , let me guess who paid for that study .
big antacid .
shirley , chew on a eucalyptus root
and--i know it sounds gross-- pig saliva .
it &apos;s the same active ingredient as antacid .
they just dress it up with a fancy name .
how dare they .
hey , you want to see a movie today ?
word .
cool .
hey , guys , why do you do that ?
do what ?
it &apos;s cool .
how ?
i don &apos;t know . it just is .
well , let me in . let me in to the handshake .
give you $ 1,000 .
indecent proposal .
indecent proposal .
woody .
demi .
nice .
you two gonna fall in love ?
no . i don &apos;t know .
so have you considered natural childbirth ?
are you kidding me ? i &apos;ll take whatever they got .
an epidural is a proper christian woman &apos;s
only chance to get wrecked .
yeah , but from what i &apos;m told ,
the real high is the endorphin rush
of a chemical @-@ free birth .
i read an article that said
some women can actually achieve or--
uh @-@ uh , no , no , no . thank you for the conversation .
i know what you &apos;re talking about .
and even if it were true ,
that &apos;s not something a woman does
on her child &apos;s head .
but--
mmm !
listen , backseat birther ,
shirley &apos;s on her third kid .
she doesn &apos;t need a third @-@ year @-@ old slacker
with two one @-@ eyed cats governing her body .
first of all ,
together , my cats can do anything .
secondly , you disqualified yourself from this conversation
the moment you decided to grow away .
i regret nothing .
i feel sorry for the airhead
that you &apos;re gonna knock up at the age of 70 .
you &apos;re gonna be sitting in the waiting room
playing solitaire on your blackberry
while a life is created ten feet from you .
oh , and you &apos;re gonna squat in a babbling brook
and a beautiful star child is going to slide out
on a ray of sunshine while your cats each half watch
because you &apos;re so natural .
oh @-@ oh . okay . oh , boy .
can someone please get every mop on campus ?
um , did you break water ? is that broken water ?
that &apos;s broken water !
chang baby !
nice and easy . careful .
oh , father , god almighty , this isn &apos;t happening .
it &apos;s too soon .
i don &apos;t want my baby &apos;s first memory
to be star @-@ burns .
oh , goodness . all right .
this is not a big deal . wait . i mean , it is a big deal .
it &apos;s just not a big bad deal . it &apos;s a big good deal .
if i could have everyone &apos;s attention--
actually would like not to have your attention .
okay , give me your attention .
this student is having a baby . what am i talking about ?
you already know .
okay , here &apos;s-- okay , here &apos;s what it is .
i &apos;m gonna go get my prius ,
i &apos;m gonna pull around the back ,
and i &apos;m gonna drive her to the hospital .
i drive a prius , which i think is pretty cool .
dean , go !
okay , dean gone .
can you please call andre ?
he &apos;s &quot; sugar boots &quot; in my phone .
that hurts , shirley .
oh , oh , i &apos;ll get it because i am here for you .
we came so close to having one class
that wasn &apos;t all about them .
remember when they all took that
fishing trip on st. patrick &apos;s day ?
god , that was a good week .
this has got to be a chang baby .
changs are never born in hospitals .
more like taxicabs , hardware stores ,
bank lines , sewers .
my nephew jin was born on a treadmill
at bally total fitness .
20 % incline .
&quot; sugar boots &quot; says that he &apos;ll meet us at the hospital .
good . now can somebody do something about him ?
i &apos;m just saying nobody needs to freak out .
a chang is hearty to the core .
we always come out healthy .
that &apos;s why there &apos;s like a billion of us .
you ever tried googling me ? can &apos;t be done !
ben , you have to stop freaking her out .
hey , show me some respect .
i might be that child &apos;s estranged father .
well , what &apos;s it gonna be ?
what ?
i want to buy the rights to your handshake .
do we have a deal ?
pierce , we &apos;re about to take shirley to the hospital .
this is not the time .
oh , it &apos;s the time .
according to my watch , it &apos;s 1,000 o &apos;clock .
deal .
deal .
great .
so how does it work ?
i don &apos;t know .
we just kind of do it
when one of us says something awesome .
yeah .
all right . betty grable .
i said betty grable .
no .
yes .
no .
do it .
make your money , whore .
who &apos;s betty grable ?
yeah , that &apos;s the stuff .
try to take deep breaths and relax .
where is the dean ?
oh , my god !
okay .
everything &apos;s wet !
eew ! oh . oh , that &apos;s okay .
that &apos;s okay because it is natural .
it &apos;s natural .
are you uncomfortable , britta ?
you wish .
oh . okay . ooh .
$ 400 . $ 500 .
it &apos;s like a million bucks in dog dollars .
word .
what happened ?
something &apos;s off .
it &apos;s like buying candy from a baby .
what did you do ? you ruined it !
troy , give him back the money .
no , no , no . money doesn &apos;t matter anymore .
once you &apos;ve sold something out , you can &apos;t get it back .
but you didn &apos;t even like our handshake !
i hated it . now it &apos;s gone .
you two are dumber than jackie coogan .
he divorced betty grable .
jeff , pierce tainted our special handshake
with his blood money
and now we can &apos;t get the magic back !
holy crap . you two for real ?
yeah .
nobody cares about your stupid handshake .
a baby is coming out of shirley &apos;s vagina
two feet from us .
don &apos;t worry .
her contractions are still six minutes apart .
so unless her cervix is dilated more than eight centimeters ,
we still have time to get her to a hospital .
i delivered a baby earlier this year
in the back of an suv .
what ?
hmm @-@ hmm .
where was i when that happened ?
i don &apos;t know . off in the background .
did you pull your car up ?
uh , no .
it &apos;s been overturned !
what ?
okay , look , i don &apos;t want to alarm anyone ,
but the world food festival has taken a dark turn .
i guess some national ethnicities don &apos;t play nice with others
and things have turned into a bit of a race ...
kerfuffle .
you mean riot ?
uh , let &apos;s use kerfuffle for now , okay , mr. winger ?
i was just trying to feed hungry foodies .
i &apos;m going to call an ambulance .
oh , there &apos;s ambulances out there !
they &apos;re overturning those too !
i mean , i didn &apos;t even know there was a difference
between north and south korean barbeque .
i mean , m.a.s.h lasted longer than that war .
get over it . am i right ? don &apos;t print that .
let &apos;s just quit jotting . stop writing !
okay , 911 says it &apos;s gonna take over an hour
because of a race kerfuffle .
oh . lake woebegone . eeh !
abed , what do we do ?
shirley , pretend i &apos;m saying this
in a soothing , reassuring , non @-@ robotic voice .
we &apos;re not going to make it to the hospital .
yes , i am .
i &apos;m going to have this baby in a hospital
with my husband and the father of my baby .
unless that father is me .
in which case , what you need to do now
is elevate your legs over your head
while facing the northeast corner of the room .
but try not to look at the door , okay ?
that &apos;s bad luck and chang babies are very superstitious .
also if you can visualize a rabbit riding a dragon ,
it &apos;ll increase his chances of winning lotteries .
ben , corner .
listen , shirley , we &apos;re having the baby right here , right now .
okay .
okay .
troy , get every blanket and coat you can find .
anything soft for shirley to lie on .
annie , i need you to call andre
and tell him to meet us here instead .
what can i do ?
stop grabbing her shoulders .
what are you doing ?
being natural .
jeff , help me move shirley to the ground .
all right , just stand right here .
easy . easy . troy , blankets . there we go .
okay .
i just need to take a look
and see how far along you are .
oh , no , i &apos;m sorry , abed .
i don &apos;t feel comfortable with you taking a grand tour of my nethers .
i &apos;d prefer it was one of the girls .
i can do it ! i can do it ! i &apos;m good at looking !
i &apos;m here for you , shirley . okay , what do i do ?
okay , you just need to look and see if the baby &apos;s head
has reached the cervix .
no problowe , rob lowe .
i take it the head has reached the cervix .
oh , god . okay . oh , god . all right .
not to worry . this kind of thing happens all the time .
are a lot of babies born in classrooms ?
well , a lot more are conceived .
no , paul , that &apos;s off the record and not true . sort of .
annie .
got to go .
hey , okay , due to an unforeseen conflict of genitals
i &apos;ve been disqualified from delivering shirley &apos;s baby
so i &apos;m gonna have to walk you through it .
i can &apos;t deliver a baby .
i &apos;m not properly prepared .
i need to take a class , or read a book ,
or shadow a nurse , or at least have my mom hug me first .
oh , god . oh , god . i &apos;m seeing spots .
oh , my lord , my lord ,
why are you doing these things to me ?
how have i failed you ?
either way , someone &apos;s got to calm her down .
i got this . shirley , look at me .
look at my face .
connect with me .
ha ha ha ha ha
what in the hell ?
i don &apos;t know what to do !
chang ! where &apos;s chang ?
what &apos;s up , baby ?
you said chang babies all come this way ?
yeah , like a bullet from a gun .
and they &apos;re all okay ?
hell , yeah .
more than okay . super babies .
seven generations of little scrappers
born in the worst conditions you can imagine .
tell me .
my cousin slid out feet first in a pickle barrel .
my uncle was born during rainy season in a mongolian sheep pasture .
my brother , hmm , born under a crowded noodle bar
while my grandfather finished his happy dancing shrimp .
nothing can stop us .
not the hurricanes . not the communists .
not the feds . not the girl scouts .
what are you doing ? get in there .
me ? forget it . i &apos;m the worst .
well , that &apos;s a discussion for a different time .
look , britta , there is something in you
that wants to take care of people so bad
that you &apos;ll do it until you puke .
that &apos;s what shirley needs right now .
are you saying i &apos;ll be a good mom ?
what ? no .
man , you will really force anything , won &apos;t you ?
just get in there and force that baby out of shirley .
step aside , people ! britta for the win !
get out of my way . okay . i am ready .
abed , walk me through this .
okay , at each contraction ,
you need to tell shirley to push .
that &apos;s it ?
well , don &apos;t tell any doctors i said this ,
but at this point in time ,
the bus pretty much drives itself .
who exactly is the bus in this scenario ? oh !
push !
the head is out !
now feel under the neck for the umbilical cord .
there &apos;s no cord .
i think that &apos;s a good thing , britta .
oh , i am nailing this ! you &apos;re doing great too .
chang , more stories .
okay , so in world war ii ,
a lot of us were rounded up in labor camps .
mining mostly .
hundreds of changs were born underneath the earth .
most spent their first five years underground .
hey , i &apos;m here .
oh , andre !
okay . hi , baby .
it &apos;s gonna be all right .
okay .
it &apos;s okay , ma &apos;am . we can take it from here .
guys , i got it . i &apos;m in the zone .
okay , come on , shirley . come on , shirley .
come on , shirley . push push push .
push it !
push !
it &apos;s baby greendale .
you guys don &apos;t have to name it that .
i don &apos;t claim that power . i &apos;m merely the deliverer .
britta , focus .
oh , doy . okay .
come on , shirley .
oh , it &apos;s a boy !
and it &apos;s also a black person !
not that that &apos;s important .
are you sure it &apos;s yours , baby ?
yes .
it &apos;s definitely his .
i never told you this part ,
but all changs are born with tails .
you kind of dodged a bullet there .
did that just happen ?
it &apos;s back .
it never left .
oh , we did it , sugar boots .
no , you did it , baby .
congratulations , sir .
after a fierce campaign , i happily concede
this baby to you .
pretty classy of me .
thank you , chang .
couldn &apos;t have done this without you .
no bigs .
andre .
yeah .
i think i want to name him after ben .
what ?
really ?
really ?
yeah . i mean , you may not be his father ,
but you helped bring him into the world .
all right , well , we &apos;ll have our own little baby ben ...
bennett .
ben bennett ?
oh , damn .
okay . no , no . no , that &apos;s fine .
ben bennett . hi , ben bennett .
oh , look , he said chang .
no . no , he didn &apos;t .
see ? nothing to it .
yeah .
can you believe that &apos;s how we come into this world ?
screaming , crying , covered in crap ?
and then somewhere along the lines ,
we get it into our heads that we &apos;re destined for greatness .
we are . i just yanked a little dude
out of my friend .
yeah . i guess we passed anthropology .
look at how teeny his hands are .
you &apos;re so little , right ?
his fingers are like good &amp; plenties .
i know . i want to eat them .
which is lame .
totally .
this has been quite a day .
you can expect a cover story in the next issue .
in a good way ?
like an article about what a good dean i am ?
absolutely .
i did it .
i did it . i am a good dean .
i am a good dean !
are you sure you want to do this ?
i know people do it in movies all the time ,
but there are bound to be real world consequences .
i know , but if we take that test today ,
we are definitely going to fail it .
okay , let &apos;s do it .
what are you guys doing ?
cancel school today or we tell everybody about this .
