i had lyman ellis steal what he could
off of nolan &apos;s hard drive .
but before he could deliver it , he was found dead .
you &apos;re trusting the wrong people .
nolan hasn &apos;t told you everything .
nolan and i have no secrets .
people to whom you &apos;ve placed your loyalty have two faces .
i want a family and a real marriage one day ,
but with somebody stable ,
not someone who ...
someone you pity .
i think , uh , i think it &apos;s time that we end this marriage .
i live between two worlds .
you couldn &apos;t possibly understand .
yeah , but i want to . don &apos;t shut me out .
the truth is that malcolm black was my attacker .
daniel saved my life .
there is one secret , and it &apos;s cost the ones i love
more than i ever wanted .
i am david clarke &apos;s daughter .
i am amanda clarke .
i took the identity of emily thorne
in order to clear my father &apos;s name .
nolan lied to me .
i trusted him .
he could &apos;ve told me about emily , about tony ,
about how he really felt about me .
oh , poppet .
emily and nolan are strangers to honesty .
there &apos;s so much more you don &apos;t know .
then i want the truth .
all of it .
it has now been 12 hours
since amanda clarke &apos;s announcement
captured the country &apos;s attention .
as questions multiply , her camp has been clear ...
there will be no further comment
from either ms. clarke or her father .
now other players in this saga ...
botably , socialite victoria grayson ,
have also yet to comment .
so far , so good .
radio silence from both victoria and margaux .
that doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;ll last .
well , the longer they &apos;re quiet ,
the longer your legend has time to grow online .
exhibit &quot; a ... &quot;
twitter &apos;s debating what people are supposed to call you now .
# amanda or # emily ?
emily thorne no longer exists .
it &apos;s the end of an era .
my dad cut a deal with the feds .
in exchange for not suing the government
over his 20 @-@ year ordeal ,
they &apos;re not coming after me for fraud .
i wish the same could be said for all of our takedowns .
i &apos;ve been tracking them ,
and one &apos;s been particularly busy ,
making calls to the rest of the red sharpie society .
tom kingsly .
the former senator ?
or as i like to call him ,
the corrupt prosecutor
who convicted david , then rode a tide of public goodwill
into that seat in congress .
until we pulled it out from under him .
i came here tonight
to announce that i will not be seeking re @-@ election this fall ...
... as i am retiring from public life .
how did you do it ?
how &apos;d you get your hands on a sex tape ?
i bought the building that his mistress lives in .
as part of the renovations , i had cameras installed .
and now ?
i release the videos to the press .
why ? you already got what you wanted .
you destroyed a man &apos;s career .
i want to destroy his life .
if he had done the right thing ,
he would &apos;ve saved my father .
he chose not to , so ... down he goes .
you scare me .
good .
you never forget your first .
kingsly &apos;s when we became a team . remember ?
of course i do .
look , if he &apos;s putting together a coalition ,
we have to stop him before it reaches critical mass .
i figured one of them would try to get the ball rolling .
we just have to stay ahead of any surprises .
whoops . missed one .
it &apos;s been hours .
you &apos;re supposed to be the next nolan ross .
more like he &apos;s the old me .
but the guy still has major skills .
one wrong line of code , the files self @-@ destruct .
same happens if you try to download it ,
which means this flash drive is your only copy .
i rigged a comprehensive decrypt that should do the trick .
but it &apos;ll take a couple hours .
understand something . if you speak a word of this ,
&quot; self @-@ destruct &quot; will take on a whole new meaning for you .
louise . how &apos;d it go with your attorney ?
fine , i suppose .
when she got to the grounds for divorce ,
i just ... froze up .
i mean , i know nolan lied ,
but does that make him the devil ?
you saw the press conference last night . you know .
that his friend emily is really amanda clarke ?
maybe that explains why he had to lie .
i mean , the news is calling her
the modern @-@ day count of monte cristo .
oh , how fitting , since they &apos;re both works of fiction .
you were kind enough to give me the thumb drive ,
so i feel that you have
the right to know the whole truth .
porter .
why am i not surprised ?
emily .
you okay ?
yeah .
so you owe me 50 bucks .
why is that ?
well , i bet my brother that you were gonna call to fill me in
before i dropped him at the airport .
guess where i just came from .
i know you &apos;re pissed .
yeah , and my friends -- they keep asking me ,
&quot; what kind of detective doesn &apos;t know the real name
of the woman that he &apos;s been dating ? &quot;
and , of course , once internal affairs starts asking
how i also helped her close a case
that she just admitted was a cover @-@ up ...
look , i know this is messy .
why don &apos;t you just say , &quot; i &apos;m sorry &quot; ?
or just start there ?
i thought that went without saying .
and with ... with these circumstances ...
that &apos;s what life is ... a series of circumstances .
the fact that you didn &apos;t even consider mine says it all .
no , you &apos;re right , and i am sorry .
if i could do it over again ...
it &apos;s too late .
that &apos;s why they call it live television .
even you don &apos;t get a do @-@ over .
so it was one big plan , right from the beginning ?
yes .
emily thorne arrived in the hamptons
a fully formed monster with a single @-@ minded purpose ...
to systematically destroy me and attack my life
by tormenting my son and my daughter ...
then , finally , my very sanity .
the second i laid eyes on you , i knew something was wrong .
and that &apos;s how i ended up in claremont .
don &apos;t struggle .
it &apos;ll only make things worse .
what are you doing ?
you needed help .
i had no choice but to check you in .
help me !
someone help me , please !
don &apos;t you dare ! don &apos;t you dare !
goodbye , victoria .
my god , victoria .
i had ... no idea what she put you through .
but nolan ...
are you sure he was involved ?
louise , i know it &apos;s difficult for you to believe .
and i understand .
it &apos;s painful when we take the scales from our eyes .
but we all have to see .
&quot; wedding night &quot; ?
&quot; homeland security &quot; ?
everything she needed
to send my fiance to his grave .
will you marry me ?
yes , pascal . yes .
that lying bastard .
i &apos;m gonna hang him by his unmentionables .
no , louise .
continue with your civil divorce .
why ?
because first ,
i need to bring the tale of america &apos;s newest folk hero
to its proper end .
第四集 第十九集
farewell , rebecca .
we hardly knew you .
you didn &apos;t come home last night .
just &apos; cause we &apos;re splittin &apos; up doesn &apos;t mean you had to split .
i stayed in the city
so i could have the divorce papers drawn up .
already ?
don &apos;t worry . you won &apos;t find any surprises .
not like , &quot; turn on the tv to discover
&quot; your husband &apos;s hiding some global mystery
about his best friend &apos;s identity from you &quot; surprises .
i ... i ...
that threw me , too .
oh , really ?
so you didn &apos;t know she was amanda clarke ?
no . no , i did .
i- i just ...
i didn &apos;t know she was gonna announce it last night .
louise .
look , i &apos;m so sorry i had to keep that information from you .
you know , that is a lot of syllables
when &quot; i lied &quot; would do .
but you know what ? i get it .
no one &apos;s ever gonna be as close to you
as emily ... amanda . whatever .
but that has nothing to do with us .
doesn &apos;t it , though ?
you are a man of many secrets , nolan .
secret friends ,
secret bonfire parties ,
secret laptops you slam shut
every time i walk through the damn door .
okay , i get it .
i get it . you &apos;re upset .
lou , can we just sit down and talk ?
there &apos;s nothing left to talk about .
this is on me .
i was so grateful to you when you rescued me
from the grip of my mama &apos;s talons , but ...
you were never my true wonder twin .
goodbye , nolan .
that girl took our reputations and our careers ,
but i promise you , harmon ,
we will make her pay .
was that uncle bill ?
tell him i say hi .
how ... how did you ...
w @-@ what are you ...
come on , tom . full sentences .
emily .
or do i say &quot; amanda &quot; ?
it &apos;s been a long time
since you lied your way into my campaign office .
and even longer
since you knowingly prosecuted an innocent man
and put him behind bars .
i tried the case i was given , and i got a conviction .
my hands are clean .
if that &apos;s true , then why are you sharing a wall with ...
what is that , a nail salon next door ?
you made a big mistake going public .
it took me five minutes to figure out
how you dismantled my life ,
10 to realize that i &apos;m not the only one .
so i made some calls .
to assemble your army of outraged cowards ?
let me guess ... you started with
good , old @-@ fashioned , wife @-@ beating judge barnes .
the greater the power ,
the greater the potential for abuse .
then wall street crook bill harmon .
emily thorne .
as far as our investors are concerned ,
it &apos;s just another sunshiny day .
it &apos;s leaked . all our investors are pulling out .
we &apos;re finished .
he betrayed my father &apos;s friendship
to help you on the stand .
and i bet you &apos;re having a difficult time locating lydia davis ,
who you so expertly used to put the final nail in the coffin .
taking the stand was clarke &apos;s secretary lydia davis .
whose testimony supported
the damning allegations made
by clarke &apos;s former boss conrad grayson .
conrad ? what &apos;s wrong ?
we need to get him in quick .
what does that mean ?
my god . is this your husband ?
do you need a ride to the hospital ?
no , i don &apos;t . i ...
lydia . hi .
oh , don &apos;t tell me you &apos;ve taken up
volunteering at the met as well .
emily &apos;s renting my house for the summer .
we met briefly on the beach .
and then yesterday at the southfork inn .
i hope your husband &apos;s feeling better .
there &apos;s nothing honesty about you ,
and i can finally prove it .
here &apos;s the &quot; after . &quot; clearly not you .
ready for the &quot; before &quot; ?
and there you are , emily .
looks just like you ,
but with a billion fewer dollars .
there has been much speculation as to who shot me .
it was lydia davis .
and my husband and i are offering a $ 10 million reward
for her capture .
she thought she could take me down .
but she was wrong , just like you .
you think that scares me ?
after what you &apos;ve done ?
you ruined lives .
you &apos;ve taken our future .
everyone that you went after had people who depended on them !
you stole 20 years of my life ,
my daughter &apos;s childhood ,
and you tried to end me .
you all had it coming
the moment you sold your souls to conrad .
david , i @-@ i ...
if you or anybody else on that damn list
makes a move against amanda ...
look over your shoulder ,
&apos;cause i will end you .
you think you suffered at the hands of my daughter ,
you have no idea what i &apos;m capable of .
you hear me ?
so get on the phone and spread the word ...
stay away from david and amanda clarke .
victoria &apos;s reaching out ?
i won &apos;t answer .
that &apos;s called survival instinct .
you should follow it .
i &apos;ll handle victoria .
i love you ,
and there &apos;s nothing you can say
or tell me that you don &apos;t love me , too .
because someday , i may need you to save me .
we can be better together .
please , daniel , come home .
i need you . we need you .
margaux ?
victoria .
i assumed that you would have all hands on deck
trying to pierce the media myth your competitors
are building around amanda clarke .
we &apos;ve got a problem .
connie bales at &quot; primetime &quot; wants an exclusive .
this is not my priority .
today , i &apos;m focusing on a story
with far more import to you and me ...
the clearing of daniel &apos;s name .
i &apos;ll let others traffic in rumor and speculation
about amanda clarke .
well , i &apos;m not here about gossip and innuendo .
on the contrary , i just spent the entire morning
making sure that conrad &apos;s conspirators
will not disrupt my case i &apos;m building against her .
i have the evidence of amanda &apos;s crimes ,
and she &apos;s left quite a body count .
amanda clarke is not a killer .
really ?
she selected my son for sacrifice
long before he sacrificed himself .
oh , my god !
i &apos;m so sorry .
god , i &apos;m such an idiot .
i &apos;m daniel .
emily .
how about i get you a dry martini ?
twice the alcohol , half the stain potential .
sure .
why did you tell me i was gonna be a father ? !
i &apos;m sorry .
no !
what did you do ? !
and let &apos;s not forget what she did to your father ,
who died trying to protect us from threats that she made
posing as a homeland security agent ,
which is a federal crime .
ms. thorne .
no . agent rebecca stone , homeland security .
it enough to detain you indefinitely !
you &apos;ll wear this wire to the myclone launch ,
where i will watch your every move
until you get a confession from conrad and victoria .
pascal ...
watch out !
when the government gets this evidence
and puts her behind bars , the story is yours .
please , victoria , let it go .
she caused you to lose your own child .
why don &apos;t you care ?
because i lied .
emily didn &apos;t push me .
but why did you tell me that she did ?
because i couldn &apos;t face you with the truth ,
that it was my fault .
if i hadn &apos;t been consumed by this endless feud ,
i would still be carrying my baby .
she started this feud .
she should have come after just me ,
and instead , she targeted the innocent .
no , you &apos;re not hearing me .
oh , but i am hearing you , margaux .
amanda clarke is chaos theory ,
and i cannot let this continue .
victoria , it won &apos;t undo anything .
except her .
then i can &apos;t stand in your way ,
but i won &apos;t help you , either .
why call tom kingsly ? what &apos;s her plan ?
whatever it was , we shut it down .
i doubt it .
she just left margaux &apos;s office ,
which means she &apos;s probably trying to mount some kind of offense .
she can &apos;t do much but sling mud .
i mean , what could victoria possibly have to back up her claims ?
turns out she might have a lot .
when i got home last night after my all @-@ night vigil here ,
i started deleting files off my laptop .
you held on to files ?
it &apos;s worse .
louise came by and ...
started accusing me of keeping secrets ,
and when she looked at my laptop ...
i just knew .
i ran a diagnostic .
files were copied .
how did victoria get them ?
cell g.p.s. put louise and victoria together last night
and again this morning .
what does she have ?
emily , i &apos;m so sorry .
emily only exists in the files that victoria stole .
now answer my question !
six folders .
&quot; wedding night , &quot; &quot; claremont , &quot; &quot; homeland security ... &quot;
do you have any idea what you &apos;ve exposed me to ? !
does part of you wanna get caught ?
no ? what ? of course not !
then why hold on to anything ? !
amanda , ease off .
because ...
it meant something to me . because i ...
i wanted to remember what ... what we had accomplished .
and what ? you can &apos;t understand that ? !
understand this ...
the last thing that you accomplished
is , quite possibly , to ruin all of it .
that &apos;s the &quot; primetime &quot; studio .
victoria &apos;s going to the press .
not if i can help it .
please let me try and fix this .
you &apos;ve already fixed enough .
whatever needs to be done , i &apos;ll do by myself .
i &apos;m flattered you want to interview me , ms. bales .
your story needs to be told properly , victoria .
wife to conrad grayson , lover to david clarke ,
mother @-@ in @-@ law to amanda clarke .
who married your son , daniel grayson ,
who we now know died a hero .
you &apos;ve had quite an experience the last 20 years .
it has been a very difficult time .
all the more reason to allow my viewing public to support you .
i can &apos;t . first , there are measures
that may have to be taken by the authorities
when they learn the whole truth .
or you can just hear it from me , ms. bales .
amanda clarke .
it &apos;s a pleasure .
i &apos;m not usually a fan of the media .
and yet here you are .
as , it seems , are you .
here &apos;s the deal ...
i sit down with you for an exclusive interview ,
live , tonight , no questions off @-@ limits ...
on one condition ...
you don &apos;t put victoria grayson on , ever .
it was open .
yeah . well ...
turns out security &apos;s not really my strong suit .
yeah , david filled me in .
don &apos;t beat yourself up , man .
no . no , i @-@ i &apos;ve got people in my life to do that for me .
had .
her interview &apos;s about to start . are you not watching ?
i think i &apos;ve seen about enough of her for today .
she was pissed .
at the wrong person . louise stole ...
it was me .
it was me who kept the files .
what the hell &apos;s wrong with me ? it &apos;s like ...
it &apos;s like i &apos;ve got a blind spot .
for amanda clarke .
it &apos;s possible you &apos;re not the only one .
it &apos;s like ...
for four years , i thought that i was ...
part of something bigger than myself . but ...
if i had known the truth ,
i would &apos;ve just erased as i went .
and what &apos;s the truth ?
that i &apos;m just a hacker who provided the software
that ran emily thorne . now that emily &apos;s gone ...
i &apos;m obsolete .
please tell me that is the bourbon talking .
look , for better or worse , you guys were the dynamic duo .
you are the dynamic duo .
amanda clarke !
who are you ?
nolan ross . friend of your father &apos;s .
it only took 10 years to return the favor .
i was kind of hoping you &apos;d have to repay this one never .
two years ago , i never would &apos;ve thought i &apos;d have ...
a partner in all this ,
or a real friend .
now that &apos;s a revenge all @-@ star opportunity .
what do you have on tap ?
a long summer of fun .
trust me .
i do ... with my life .
amanda couldn &apos;t let you go if she wanted to .
jack , if you had seen the way that she acted ...
she was scared .
doesn &apos;t happen often , but ...
things are changing ,
and soon , it &apos;s all gonna be out of her control .
we should go watch this thing now ,
&apos;cause you know how she gets when you save things for later .
sometimes , a compelling opportunity presents itself .
this is such a time .
tonight , we are honored to have amanda clarke .
thank you for finding the time to squeeze me in .
of course . the whole world is dying to hear your story ...
save victoria grayson .
she didn &apos;t seem too thrilled to see you here .
nothing &apos;s off @-@ limits , right ? your words .
now what i saw between you backstage
was nothing short of animosity .
she and i have had ...
a disturbing relationship , dating back to my childhood .
how so ?
it started before my father was arrested .
while conrad grayson made sure
that my father was convicted ,
victoria set her sights on his 9 @-@ year @-@ old daughter .
the last person in the world who still believed in him .
she had me locked up ,
brainwashed , and tortured ...
until i stopped believing , too .
in return , you see to it that amanda gets
the care she needs in a proper institution .
please don &apos;t leave me in here .
i promise i &apos;ll be a good girl .
you &apos;d just be pretending .
the past continues to define her present ,
and she &apos;s given me no reason to believe
that it won &apos;t define her future as well .
so what made you see the light ?
my father did ,
from prison ,
with words ...
written to a daughter he thought he &apos;d lost forever .
when she &apos;s ready ...
i want you to make sure that she gets this .
open the box .
my dear amanda ...
in the pages that follow ,
i &apos;ve attempted to piece together
the ruthless betrayal
that brought about my false imprisonment
and our unbearable separation .
i hope this chronicle will one day
provide you an understanding
of what i believe happened to me .
he saved me ,
so i saved him ...
the only way that i knew how ...
by becoming emily thorne .
so from the time that you took on
a new name and a new identity ,
you knew that you would have to deceive everyone .
yes .
what did those lies do to the people who cared about you ?
what was the cost ?
the cost ?
it &apos;s high .
people like the real emily thorne ,
who died saving her family .
we &apos;re sisters , right ?
right .
stay strong ... amanda .
you , too ... emily .
emily , get down !
oh , my god . i &apos;m so sorry .
you &apos;ve given me the one thing i thought i &apos;d never have ...
a real family .
my half @-@ sister charlotte ,
driven into a downward spiral by all of us .
leave peacefully ,
and lay off the drugs , or i will arrest you .
i don &apos;t wanna think anything .
i don &apos;t even wanna feel anything .
&apos;cause you are gonna keep
your stupid and thankless mouth shut !
and if you even think about crossing me ,
i will erase you as i have so many others .
aiden mathis .
the one person who really understood what i was doing .
you need to stay focused ,
get the evidence .
you &apos;re gonna need this later .
you &apos;re not alone in this .
you never will be .
when they pay for what they did to your father ,
then what ?
i can be with you .
just go and make sure everything &apos;s ready for when this is done .
come back when the dust settles .
well , at least i get to say goodbye this time .
the man that i was gonna
spend the rest of my life with .
being with you is the only time i &apos;ve ever felt peace .
you &apos;re everything to me .
amanda clarke ...
will you marry me ?
yes .
taken from me ... forever .
aiden ?
aiden , are you okay ?
aiden , wake up .
aiden , wake up !
no ! no ! no ! no !
no !
i &apos;m sorry .
now i have to ask ,
did you ever have to harm anyone physically
in order to protect your identity ?
yes .
did it ever go beyond that ?
i would never cross that line .
sounds like you think you know someone who has .
victoria ?
emily ripped away my chance for true love .
it &apos;s only fair that i do the same for her .
goodbye , mr. mathis .
that &apos;s a strong accusation , ms. clarke .
i didn &apos;t make an accusation .
it &apos;s on victoria to take responsibility for her own actions .
i do have sympathy for her , though .
she was born with a dark soul .
we know that she was ...
convicted of killing a man at 15 .
she only grew more toxic ever since .
this is why i waited to reveal myself .
i knew what she was capable of
if she learned the truth .
even when she thought i was emily thorne ,
victoria schemed ,
plotted , and railed against me , my friends , and loved ones .
do you think it &apos;s all over now ?
i pray that it is .
but deep down inside , i know it &apos;s not .
victoria , if you &apos;re watching ,
it is in your hands to end this .
i can &apos;t imagine how she feels
finally getting to say everything out loud .
and she &apos;s not revenging anymore . she &apos;s just ...
our amanda now .
yeah , you &apos;re right .
wait .
jack , are you going to her ?
no . no , i &apos;m ... i &apos;m meeting someone for drinks .
why aren &apos;t you going to her ?
we &apos;re not doing this .
but this is your moment .
this is the girl you met on the beach .
this is the girl that you named your boat after .
the &quot; amanda &quot; ?
yeah .
sammy named her .
sammy ! sammy ! get down !
what &apos;s the matter with you ?
sorry . he &apos;s not normally this friendly .
kind of an old grump , actually .
i &apos;m jack .
i &apos;m amanda .
i &apos;ll come back for you .
i promise .
it &apos;s nice to see you again .
sammy .
he &apos;s home .
he was a really good friend .
you two belong together .
and deep down ,
she knows it .
does she ?
you get a boat out on the open water ,
then you catch a wind , and the sails fill .
and she comes to life under you ,
and it feels like more than just wind
and water and vessel .
it feels like there &apos;s something else going on ,
something pulling you forward and ...
and surrounding you at the same time .
am i making any sense ?
you &apos;re making perfect sense .
it &apos;s just , you &apos;re saying it to the wrong girl , jack .
i feel like this feeling ...
comes along once or twice in a lifetime , if we &apos;re lucky .
tell me i &apos;m alone in this .
tell me i &apos;m alone in this ,
and i won &apos;t bother you again .
i &apos;m so sorry , jack .
look , thank you for the pep talk .
good night , nolan .
victoria ?
victoria ?
i tried to call you .
i turned the phones off .
i couldn &apos;t listen to them ring anymore .
what emily said ...
it was cruel to go on the air and spout such vitriol ,
to say nothing of the outright lies .
i know you never killed a man when you were young .
i never felt comfortable bringing it up ,
but daniel told me what your mother did to you .
take the gun . aim for his chest .
no , i can &apos;t .
we &apos;ll tell the police that he attacked us ,
that you shot him to protect me .
i &apos;m so sorry .
they all picked away at your dignity
and your happiness .
your mother ...
i should &apos;ve listened to your deadbeat father ,
gotten rid of you before you were even born .
conrad ...
it &apos;s time you know the truth .
david clarke isn &apos;t just amanda &apos;s father .
he &apos;s your biological father as well .
no . he &apos;s not .
mom ...
charlotte .
i will never forgive you for this .
and i &apos;ll never forgive you
for inviting that bastard into our bed .
and , emily , i know what a woman in love looks like ,
and that &apos;s not you .
i understand why you &apos;re on edge , victoria .
especially here , tonight .
i can &apos;t imagine how difficult it must be for you
to spend time in david clarke &apos;s old house .
the memories of love and betrayal that must flood in ...
i &apos;ll give you a moment ,
since you so clearly need one .
do not let them win .
you have the evidence . call the authorities .
believe me , margaux ,
i &apos;ve tried to make things right so many times .
i went to the government to put conrad away for life
and to clear david &apos;s name , and she knew it .
i want full immunity
in exchange for the information i &apos;m about to give you .
i can &apos;t guarantee anything
till i know what we &apos;re talking about .
but now she &apos;s won in the court of public opinion .
amanda clarke has dug a grave for me tonight .
but i won &apos;t let her put you in it .
victoria , let me help you ,
just like you helped me in my times of need .
you can &apos;t resurrect
a woman dead to the world .
you know how much i love you , amanda ?
infinity ?
well , infinity ...
times ...
infinity .
daddy , what are you doing ?
when this is done , it &apos;s gonna be a reminder
that no mistake is ever gonna break us apart .
i could not be more proud of you , sweetheart .
tonight , the world got to know you the way i do .
i hope so .
i haven &apos;t seen this since i made it for you .
it &apos;s a little worse for wear .
aren &apos;t we all ?
&quot; my dear amanda , if you are reading this ,
then two things have come to pass . &quot;
&quot; i am finally able to provide you
the life you were unjustly denied . &quot;
&quot; and sadly , i &apos;m not gonna be able to share that life with you . &quot;
well , you were half right .
it all started so wonderfully .
you and i on the beach ,
sammy , jack .
we really get to spend the whole summer here ?
and every summer after that .
what &apos;s his name ?
happy birthday .
uh , that is up to you . what &apos;s he look like ?
like a sammy .
sammy !
are you licking daddy ?
you know what i love about you most ?
is the way you love
absolutely everything and absolutely everyone .
you promise me that you &apos;re never gonna lose that .
i &apos;ve spent my whole life chasing that happiness ...
and it was all taken away in an instant .
after what i did tonight ...
it &apos;s all gonna change again .
you let the whole world in .
emily thorne would never have done that .
she was prepared for anything .
for the first time ...
i have no idea what &apos;s coming next .
