i just love that we &apos;re here .
is there anything more important than clean water
in developing countries ?
or a clean glass in this one ?
it that anne gibbs , the lady from channel 12 news ?
oh , my god ! it &apos;s anne gibbs ! oh , i love her !
that reaction would &apos;ve
been big if it was anne hathaway .
oh , she is hiding quite a figure behind that desk .
okay , what &apos;s going on with you and anne gibbs ?
come on . we gotta go say hi to her .
okay , we &apos;re doing this .
i &apos;m sorry .
i am such a fan .
i was so moved by that story you did
about the gymnast with the hump .
you wanna hear something crazy ?
yeah .
he just got a scholarship to notre dame .
no ! oh , my gosh !
you probably get this all the time ,
but i have a story for you .
i represent some homeless people
in a case against a corporation that pays them slave wages .
interesting .
yes .
how long has this been going on ?
since 2012 .
we &apos;re just trying to shine a light
on how awful they &apos;re being .
truly awful .
are you working on this , too ?
oh , gosh . no , no .
i &apos;m just this one &apos;s husband .
i &apos;m a high school football coach .
cameron tucker .
yes . oh , god . i &apos;m so embarrassed .
mitchell pritchett . how are you ?
really ? - so --
you are an openly gay high school football coach ?
i know , i know . you hear &quot; football coach , &quot;
and you expect to meet somebody
that screams john wayne .
meanwhile , the only time i &apos;ve screamed the duke
is when we argue over who &apos;s the cutest on &quot; downton abbey . &quot;
poor mitchell . he &apos;s had to hear that a hundred times .
i have . i have .
so these homeless people are making a dollar an hour --
are there a lot of openly gay coaches ?
oh , if the adult film industry &apos;s to be believed ,
there all are .
it &apos;s in , you know ,
clear violations of the federal fair labor standards act --
has anyone ever approached you for a news segment ?
on me ? ! oh , my gosh . no . i don &apos;t ...
i don &apos;t think i &apos;m interesting enough
to do a news segment on .
i mean , what would a reporter even say about me ?
that i &apos;m a high school football coach
with an undefeated record who &apos;s tackling stereotypes ?
that on my team , prejudice is considered out of bounds ?
that we &apos;re blitzing bigotry , kicking intolerance ,
and beating ...
metaphors to death ?
you guys wanna see something really cool ?
is it behind that old boat ?
this is one of the most famous warships of all time .
the &quot; u.s.s. constitution . &quot;
stayed in active duty 84 years .
no enemy managed to board her .
10 seconds , she &apos;s already bored me .
that &apos;s your spanish tutor .
i &apos;m gonna say it one more time .
i really think french will be a better fit for me .
your name is
manuel alberto javier alejandro delgado .
how is french a better fit for you ?
okay , i &apos;m pretty sure
you threw in a name i &apos;ve never heard before .
hello .
ah , ah ! en espagnol , por favor .
okay , let &apos;s take it down a nacho .
hola , diego !
you must be mr. pritchett .
jay . and i &apos;m just glad you &apos;re here .
gloria tried to tutor manny .
there was less yelling in &quot; the miracle worker . &quot;
because he wasn &apos;t even trying .
i &apos;m sorry , but spanish
just doesn &apos;t seem natural to me .
i don &apos;t like the way it hits my ear .
what could be more natural than your mother &apos;s tongue in your ear ?
do you happen to know a good english tutor ?
hey , honey !
still studying for that test ?
i can &apos;t . i have to study .
what time did you get to bed ?
sure thing .
claire , i think something &apos;s up with alex .
i don &apos;t know . some kind of chicken .
why is no one listening to me ?
come here .
i don &apos;t think she &apos;s getting enough sleep .
look at her . she &apos;s like a human roomba .
alex will be fine .
this is our real problem .
when i left for work this morning ,
she was sitting on the couch , flipping through magazines .
she &apos;s 20 . she &apos;s finding herself .
how hard can it be ? she hasn &apos;t moved .
well , what were you doing at 20 ?
me ?
i was getting a 4.0 in college .
i was working 25 hours a week .
i was volunteering at a suicide hotline .
get off the couch !
do something with your life !
was it an assisted suicide hotline ?
your father &apos;s home ...
from work .
already ? must be nice .
daddy , my doll won &apos;t stop crying .
oh , honey , did you try the &quot; off &quot; switch ?
of course i tried the &quot; off &quot; switch !
lily !
sorry i snapped .
she &apos;s been like this all d .
there you go .
that never worked on you .
so , good news .
anne gibbs actually wants to do a news segment on me !
what ? !
great news , cam .
isn &apos;t that exciting ?
they &apos;re gonna send a whole team friday ,
follow me around with a camera crew ,
then interview me at the homecoming games .
so listen , i kinda have a big favor to ask .
uh , w--okay .
traditionally , the varsity coach and his wife
cook a big pancake breakfast
for the football team for homecoming .
i do not like where this is going .
well , let me finish .
okay , continue .
how would you feel
if you and i cooked a big pancake breakfast
for the varsity football team ?
did you think that that was a twist ?
mitchell , please .
no !
no , unless you can convince tom brady to spend the night ,
i am not making breakfast for any football players .
he -- he is a football player , right ?
yes . it &apos;s the perfect reference .
but , mitchell , this is important .
so is my job . i have closing arguments on friday .
i promise you &apos;ll be out by 9 : 00 .
i just wanna show the world
that we &apos;re as supportive and respectful
as any straight couple .
that &apos;s an incredibly manipulative thing to say .
well , that &apos;s not how i meant it .
and that hurts my feelings .
oh , my god . this is so lame and transparent .
busted . you know , you &apos;re so much smarter than me .
oh , i wish i knew where your &quot; off &quot; switch was .
well , you know where my &quot; on &quot; switch is .
hey , mrs. dunphy . remember me ?
andy . of course . come on in .
you are joe &apos;s babysitter , right ?
uh , &quot; manny &quot; is what we call ourselves
in the child care community .
but it &apos;s confusing in that house
because of their son manny .
so i &apos;ve been trying to get traction with &quot; bro @-@ pair . &quot;
hey , andy .
hey , sir ... uh , mr. dunphy .
sorry . i didn &apos;t ... see you .
andy , please . &quot; sir mr. dunphy &quot; is my british name .
oh , my ... you did not just think of that !
yes !
andy , what can we do for ya ?
i &apos;m actually here --
hey , andy .
come on .
he &apos;s here for you ?
yeah . we &apos;re just gonna be in the basement .
so good to see you guys .
i don &apos;t know why i just did that .
what was that ? !
don &apos;t be offended .
in many cultures , it &apos;s customary to bow only to the man .
phil . haley , andy -- is that a thing ?
oh . i don &apos;t know .
well , i hope not .
haley is at a very low point in her life .
it &apos;s the last thing she needs right now .
sometimes a boy might be a good distraction ?
i remember a certain young lady
was pretty addicted to &quot; ms. pac @-@ man &quot;
until a dashing young gent caught her eye .
only because you were wearing a feather earring .
it wasn &apos;t a feather .
it was a dream catcher .
and it worked .
well , we &apos;re done .
one more session this week ,
and manny will be ready for his test .
ay , qu√© bueno .
gracias !
what are they saying ?
if i knew , he wouldn &apos;t be here .
where have you been ?
i &apos;ve been cooking pancakes by myself for an hour .
what can i do to help ?
uh , you can crack some eggs over there .
you know what ?
i think whisking might read better .
what are you doing ? there &apos;s nothing in there .
don , can you tell there &apos;s nothing in here ?
all good .
don &apos;s all good .
so we &apos;re getting some extra footage .
what we call &quot; b @-@ roll . &quot;
anne wants to see me help cook .
i wanna see you help cook .
i thought this was something that we were doing together .
yes , you &apos;re right . okay , let &apos;s do this . sorry .
that &apos;s perfect . i &apos;m happy .
don &apos;s happy .
i &apos;m not happy .
what &apos;s up , guys ! ?
ah , senor pritchett .
please , join us .
nice as it is for you to invite me to swim in my own pool ,
i thought i was paying you to teach manny spanish .
manny &apos;s done with his lesson .
but diego here is also a swim instructor ,
so he &apos;s going to teach joe to swim .
must be a good teacher
if joe doesn &apos;t have to be here for it .
manny &apos;s putting him in his swimming diaper .
there they are !
let &apos;s go swim !
come here .
you know , after you showed us that cool model ,
i started reading up on the &quot; u.s.s. constitution . &quot;
quite a ship in its day .
en , of course you invented steam ships .
your old sailing frigates just couldn &apos;t compete
with those younger , faster ,
steamier models in the water .
you know , it &apos;s too bad
you don &apos;t spend as much time
on your spanish homework as you do online
finding passive @-@ aggressive ways
of using my hobbies against me .
what &apos;s this ?
permission slip .
lets me transfer into french .
only one parent signature required .
come on , jay . i can &apos;t take it anymore . i quit .
you &apos;re already starting to sound french .
honey , i &apos;m getting worried about alex .
i don &apos;t think she slept again last night .
it &apos;s like the third night in a row .
i thought you were gonna set your alarm and check on her ?
stupid thing never went off .
i &apos;m sure alex slept .
i don &apos;t know .
she &apos;s sitting at her desk , too tired to move her eyeballs .
she &apos;s reading her book like this .
did anyone see my leopard print skirt ?
i saw a leopard headband on the stairs .
that &apos;s it .
alex is gonna be fine .
that &apos;s the one i &apos;m worried about .
i &apos;m gonna go talk to her .
i can &apos;t believe i just went power @-@ walking
with her skirt on my head .
haley , honey , i wanted to talk to you
about this whole thing with andy .
what &apos;s there to talk about ?
well , i &apos;m concerned that it is distracting you
from what &apos;s really important .
oh , mom , there &apos;s nothing to worry about .
you know , it &apos;s just sex .
what ?
purely physical . it &apos;s really just a stress @-@ reliever .
i am not having sex with andy . we &apos;re just friends .
i &apos;m helping him prep for a job interview
that he doesn &apos;t want anybody to know about .
the whole sex thing was the fastest way
to end the conversation with my mother .
uh , are there any more questions ?
no .
okay , cool .
oh , that &apos;s him .
hey ! oh , you look so good !
come inside . are you ready ?
yeah . i saw some stuff online ,
so i got a couple new things i wanna try out .
let &apos;s do it !
... which proves , anne ,
you can score with a gay coach .
wait . uh , can i try that again ?
no , that was great .
um , how does your spouse feel about you coaching ?
oh , this one ?
he &apos;s my rock . he &apos;s ...
he &apos;s my connie britton .
your ... your connie britton ?
mrs. coach on &quot; friday night lights . &quot;
can i talk to you for a second ?
uh , don , anne ? can we , uh ...
sure .
yeah , what &apos;s up ?
do you have any idea
how insulting you &apos;ve been to me all morning ?
what , because i just compared you to connie britton ?
mitchell , she was an equal to coach taylor .
you &apos;d know that if you saw the show .
well , i guess i missed it
because &quot; the cam show &quot; was always on .
really ? you &apos;re not gonna let me have my moment here ?
it is always your moment ,
and usually i @-@ i &apos;m fine with that .
but the other night ,
i was trying to get them to cover my case ,
and you -- you made it all about you .
i did not . that is unfair .
i have always supported your job
and know how important it is .
really ? what &apos;s my new case about ?
the only one i was talking about for three weeks .
people ...
who need people .
are they lucky , cam ?
are they the luckiest people in the world ?
daddy , she won &apos;t stop crying again .
one second , honey .
look , cam , i love you very much ,
but i resent the way you &apos;re treating me today .
okay , i am not some 1950s housewife . i ...
did you sign something
so that manny could switch to french ?
i did .
you knew that i wanted him to learn spanish .
i also know you can &apos;t force a kid
to be interested in something that he &apos;s not .
that &apos;s why i have a picture
of mitchell and his prom date shaking hands .
it would be nice for someone to care
what i think for a change .
you should also know that i hired a new swimming instructor .
but don &apos;t worry .
she &apos;s got the same broad shoulders plus a mustache .
so all this is because you &apos;re jealous ?
i can &apos;t believe that you &apos;re being so ...
in ... fer ... ur--
what is the word ?
selfish . pigheaded .
really ?
her words , not mine .
do you know how frustrating it is
to have to translate everything in my head before i say it ?
to have people laugh in my face
because i &apos;m struggling to find the words ?
you should try talking in my shoes for one mile !
i think you meant --
i know what i meant to mean .
do you even know how smart i am in spanish ?
of course you don &apos;t .
for once , it would be nice to speak to someone
in my own language in my own home .
whatever the spanish word
is for &quot; women , &quot; am i right ?
mother nature !
cheez @-@ its !
andy . i did not know you were there .
sorry . stupid little cat feet .
i &apos;m not sure where haley is .
actually , mr. dunphy , i was hoping i could speak with you .
oh , yeah ? what can i do for ya ?
mr. dunphy ,
i love being a manny ,
but i can &apos;t do it forever .
i just didn &apos;t know what the next chapter should be ,
but then i met a guy named phil dunphy .
what ?
a guy who loves what he does , and ...
yeah . a guy who provided all this for his family .
and then i realized ,
a career in real estate is what i want .
and i was hoping i could ...
learn from the best .
skip woosnum ?
um , i can put in a call .
he doesn &apos;t really get back -- - no .
you .
andy , i &apos;m -- i &apos;m so flattered .
i &apos;m , uh ,
i &apos;m just not in the market for an assistant right now .
yeah .
stupid . that was stupid to even ask .
thank you so much for your time .
lesson number one -- never take &quot; no &quot; for an answer !
now make me buy you .
okay .
uh , i &apos;m a hard worker , i am very clean ,
i am eager to please ,
i take super quick bathroom breaks ,
and i will never , ever ...
oh ! i &apos;m blanking on the verb !
w @-@ uh ... when you give up on something ?
quit ?
i had to ask
because i don &apos;t know the meaning of the word .
nice !
what &apos;s going on here ?
i &apos;m introducing you to my new assistant .
oh , my ribs !
mr. dunphy , thank you so much .
i will not disappoint you .
andy , do you think this is a great idea ,
considering that you and haley are ...
you know .
doing it .
mother nature !
cheez @-@ its !
no.we were just helping each other
get ready for job interviews .
there is nothing inappropriate happening
between me and your daughter .
haley has a job interview ?
that &apos;s where she is right now .
with who ?
gavin sinclair .
the big @-@ time stylist to the stars ?
he &apos;s the one that slapped katie couric .
our little girl &apos;s gonna be okay after all !
all right ! what &apos;d i tell ya ?
one thing about our girl -- she &apos;s a fighter .
hello . i have an appointment to see gavin sinclair .
not today . he &apos;s in a mood .
&apos;kay !
i felt awful after that pancake breakfast ,
and not just because mitchell undercooked the bacon .
i hated that i didn &apos;t know what his case was about .
so i popped by the courtroom on the way to the game .
these people preyed on the poorest members of society --
those who are unable to defend themselves .
they were treated with disrespect .
he was amazing !
and he wasn &apos;t doing any of it for himself .
he was just trying to help those in need .
can you imagine being robbed of your basic rights
and a living wage ?
and after all those years of mitchell supporting me ,
i was so happy to see all eyes on him .
it was his moment .
it &apos;s unfathomable .
but what this case ...
as i was saying ,
what this case is about is dignity --
the dignity of those ...
and we need to take these people
and we need to get them back ...
listen , i &apos;m sorry i let manny switch over to french
without consulting you .
i didn &apos;t think how it must be for you
having to speak english all the time .
you have no idea .
anyway , i just wanted to tell you i hired the tutor back .
manny &apos;s not gonna like that .
he &apos;s too much into his french thing .
the tutor &apos;s not for manny . it &apos;s for me .
ay , jay , i love it !
now you sound like the stupid one !
it &apos;s me . i &apos;m back .
why ?
i made a pact with a friend of mine ,
and i am not leaving this office
until i meet with gavin sinclair .
i don &apos;t care what &apos;s on your vision board .
you &apos;re not getting in there .
so if you could just ...
i &apos;m insanely busy .
nikki , thank god you &apos;re here .
peel this orange for me .
mr. sinclair , it &apos;s haley dunphy .
i was supposed to see you for the assistant job .
i have been studying your work ,
and i have to say
the looks that you did for new york fashion week
put you -- - ah ! i &apos;m really too busy right now .
but i drove all the way down here .
we had an appointment !
yeah , i looked at your blog .
it &apos;s a little too cutesy for me .
i need someone with edge .
i have edge .
you really don &apos;t .
you are literally the most wide @-@ eyed person i &apos;ve ever seen .
you have the face of a cartoon lamb .
thanks for coming by , though .
what is that ? i wanted the peel .
i think it &apos;s weird you don &apos;t like cutesy
considering half your clients at the grammys looked like
they just stepped out of a my little pony fever dream .
that &apos;s good . but not at me .
never at me .
nikki , stop .
there are five things wrong with nikki &apos;s outfit .
what are they ?
uh , she &apos;s standing right there .
i &apos;m dressed better than she is .
the tank gives you a uniboob .
the watch is too big .
the harem pants , the wedge boots ,
and come on , that belt ?
the &apos; 90s have been out for three years .
and that &apos;s five .
now should i do you ?
victoire ! c &apos;est magnifique !
uh , excuse me , young man .
was it coach tucker &apos;s openness
that gave you the courage to come out ?
what ?
hey , you !
come here .
court ran a little late ,
but i got to see you win .
congratulations .
thank you !
are you wearing makeup ?
oh , well , just on my face
and my ears and my neck and my hands , yeah .
okay , so listen . about this morning --
uh , coach tucker , coach tucker .
can we get a few words on your big win ?
oh , um , i @-@ i need to do this .
yeah . of course you do . yeah , it &apos;s fine .
so tell me , coach ,
how does this victory feel ?
well , it feels great .
obviously , i feel like the belle of the football .
don liked that one . don &apos;s laughing .
it &apos;s pretty groundbreaking how this school has embraced you .
well , i &apos;m grateful to this school , you know ,
and the kids and the parents .
but , um , you know , i gotta say , i &apos;m most grateful for --
for this guy right here , my husband .
uh , mitchell . mitchell pritchett .
he &apos;s an attorney
who is the voice for people without one .
he is a @-@ a real hero ...
who doesn &apos;t get the credit he deserves .
today , i went down and i watched him in the courtroom .
i knew that was you .
i recognized your ringtone .
i &apos;m building to something .
you know , yeah , i get a lot of attention ,
you know , coaching this game .
but this man right here
quietly defends the rights
of real people with real problems .
homeless people forced to get jobs .
no , that &apos;s not it .
that &apos;s not it , but it was so close .
yes , i am standing here
boldly abolishing gay stereotypes .
ËÉúÂà©‰∏çÈúÄË¶ÅË¢´Ë¥¥Ê†áÁ≠æ
but ...
my makeup &apos;s running , isn &apos;t it ?
i did it ! i got the job !
really ?
honey , i &apos;m so proud !
thank you !
never doubted you .
so great . so great .
sweetheart !
i know ! it was such a roller coaster !
the receptionist was so mean ,
and i went and i cried in my car .
and i was about to leave ,
but i remembered
how brave you were talking to my dad ,
so i got back in there !
and i did that thing you said about not throwing up .
oh , my god .
i guess some boys are a good distraction .
yeah , he could be exactly what she needs right now .
and i don &apos;t know about you ,
but i &apos;m sensing a little heat over here .
oh , my god ! i &apos;m so happy for you !
oh , this is so great .
and thanks to you , mr. dunphy ,
i can finally save up and get beth that engagement ring .
who &apos;s beth ?
his girlfriend .
so you two really aren &apos;t together ?
no .
no .
she &apos;s , like , really obsessed with us .
claire ?
the words on the page are vibrating ,
and i can &apos;t make them stop .
i forgot how to read !
alex , oh , my god .
read it to me , mommy ?
baby , you &apos;re exhausted
and you need to go to sleep right now .
come with me . come with me .
yes , you were wrong about everything !
&quot; &apos; kay &quot; ?
who says &quot; &apos; kay &quot; ? !
you &apos;re so stupid !
go ! go around !
go around !
i &apos;m not going anywhere !
i &apos;m not going anywhere !
i am not going anywhere !
i &apos;m not going anywhere .
i &apos;m not ... going ... anywhere .
mr. gavin sinclair , i &apos;m not going anywhere .
you &apos;re about to see me .
i &apos;m gonna show you i &apos;m not going anywhere !
