Let's go, Jimmy, I'm late already.
OK, grandma. Let's do this.
Yo, boy, perhaps your bed time?
We got places to be, right?
You remember what's like to being young, don't you?
You're kidding right?
You don't remember what you ate for lunch.
小伙子们
Jimmy?
跟你老妈在一起
How about you?
狗屁朋友
This guy pinched me a few years back.
Right.
You keep it clean these days?
我现在是朝九晚五的打工仔
I'm a re-ha-bili-tated.
Yeah.
But if you step out of the line, again,
我一定把你逮回去
Since when you're friends with cops?
We seem as friends to you?
It's not what I'm saying.
The people that I work for are very hardcore.
And they're all in here.
You don't trust me, Freddy?
Make up your mind.
All right, all right. Let's go.
You're gonna get the heat fixed in this car, or no?
You ever gonna stop bitching?
Why don't you come in?
You know my landlord set a place for you.
Rain check, Freddy.
I see you later.
Helen? Do you know what time it is?
Helen?
Oh my God?
Somebody help me?
他正在巴尔的摩警察局讲课
但也从未遇到此类案件
We got two bodies ID
William and Helen Dimarco,
retired, 37 years old, no kids.
20到40岁
fleeing the scene and I quote
hopped-up on those damn drugs.
That witness is a kind some of notoriously unreliable.
双重谋杀案
Why are we here?
Massive overkill.
Helen Dimarco was found here.
Tied to the chair in front of the vanity.
No defensive wounds.
Ligature marks on the wrists.
One clean laceration from here to here.
Looks arterial, probably carotid,
think she went quickly.
The husband was found in the shower.
But he wasn't quite as lucky.
Ligature marks on the wrists and ankles
and one long laceration up the abdomen
through both layers and muscles.
这是典型的无组织行为
Despite all the blood, this crime scene shows
掌控全局
it says it's pretty organized.
There's also evidence of torture with the husband.
Burns, contusions, lacerations...
You name it this guy tried it.
The torture is the unsub signature
the methodology is usually unique.
在行凶时用到火就不会再用刀
Maybe we have more than one killer
or we have one killer with more than one personality.
We also have three victims.
one on the vanity where wife's body was found,
her husband was in the shower.
For the looks of the level of the ring in this tub,
whoever was in it lost their entire blood volume.
Approximately 10.6 pints.
Which means the victim was dismembered.
Looks like our guy took all the parts with him.
Hemingway wrote,
"There is no hunting like the hunting of man.
And those who have hunted armed men long enough and liked it
never really care for anything else."
Possible suspect is a white male,
20 to 40 years old.
He is armed and very dangerous.
能看出不明嫌犯的哪些信息
变态型和功能型
是用来得到信息或是惩戒
对受虐者毫无感觉
Like a military technique.
Exactly, and there's sadistic torture
Which is used to extract some sort of emotional need.
But sadists are sexually deviant
yet there is no evidence of sexual contact.
That we know of...
我们还没找到第三具尸体
海伦·迪马克被绑在椅子上
He probably killed her first.
Proved to the others that he had no mercy.
Psychological torture before the physical pain.
And there was no satisfaction from her death.
It was too brief.
It was over too quickly.
And the husband.
With him he took his time.
There doesn't seem to be any wasted effort
No hesitation on the unsub's part.
I mean, Gideon, look around. What he did.
it's a lot of work.
要么是一个职业杀手 要么是...
a pure psychopath.
Hey it's me.
I got trouble man.
Serious trouble. Don't tell me to relax, damn it?
I ran into a detective I know last night.
Freddy saw it.
I'll meet you at 8:00.
我们待在这也无计可施
I'm guessing there's a connection to him.
He doesn't want that victim identified.
现有的档案
see if any of them involve this level of torture.
Got it.
Have her check the surrounding states as well, if...
为何总吃窝边草
How far back do you want her to go?
At least 10 years.
The guy's no rookie.
是个小混混
Frederick "Freddy" Condore.
He was the nephew of the older couple.
Body parts were found in 7 different
trash cans 2 blocks from the crime scene.
Were they able to completely reassemble the body?
Killer didn't keep any trophies.
Is there any evidence that he got off?
No.
弗吉尼亚
and Maryland over the past 15 years.
Many of them have ties to organized crime.
All different M. O's.
What's the connection?
Torture.
Marks on the bones are consistent with the same cutting tool.
Tortured victims,
most tied to organized crime.
No signs of sexual sadism.
We're looking for a hit man.
不需要用折磨来完成任务
Two things
Baltimore just forwarded a sketch
男性脸部素描
and, uh, you've got some agents out there
who think that you're poaching on their turf.
I'll handle it.
SSA Hotchner.
专门负责打击巴尔的摩犯罪团伙
杰森·吉迪恩
B.A.U. is pretty famous.
Brought the whole team?
Yeah, we were in town.
We're just going over the case.You wanna join us?
I'd love to, but I can't stay.
I just wanted to come down and say thank you
巴尔的摩查这宗案子
now that it's pretty obviously an organized crime case,
we're gonna go ahead and take over for you.
打交道也够忙活的了
是有精神病吗
What he is now is my problem.
But again, thanks for coming out.
Anything we can do to help.
Appreciate that.We're pretty good at this.
再会
好的
So we just gonna drop it?
自己在跟什么人打交道
Our unsub is male,
intelligent,
organized and methodical.
他已经作案很长时间了
是弗雷迪·康道尔
indicating some tie to him.
加西亚那边查查康道尔的背景
Dig deep, see what turns up.
Condore worked as a supervisor
at a scrap metal yard in Baltimore.
It's owned by a guy named Michael Russo,
boss of a small mob crew.
I'm gonna grab Hotch and go check him out.
Michael Russo?
Agents Hotchner and Morgan, FBI.
What do you want?
Freddy Condore.
He didn't show up for work today.
He didn't call, nothing.
在昨晚被人杀掉了
Really?
It's too bad.
Yeah?
I can tell you're all busted up about it.
Look, I don't speak smart-ass
so you got something to say to me.
It was a professional hit.
Either you're in charge of your business or you're not.
What kind of business do you think I'm in?
Look around. I'm in scrap metal.
All about recycling.
That's where the money is, my friend.
Saving the earth.
You've got a big problem.
You know, the mob isn't what it used to be.
Ain't easy always fighting for respect, is it?
You always gotta fight for what's yours.
One of your boys steps out of line,
you hit him hard,you make it count, right?
Is that what happened to Freddy?
Look.
You got a case to make,
run along, get your papers
and come back with the bracelets.
Otherwise,
I got a business to run.
You're breathing on my neck.
Sorry.
Sorry for that.
You two having fun?
Oh, yeah.
Sifting through the life and times of Freddy Condore
with Dr. Reid here is a party I wouldn't want to miss.
Credit card receipts show Freddy loved crab cakes,
preferred light beer
and used to spend his Thursday nights
with a woman in Fells Point.
An, uh, expensive woman.
What about his associates?
Most of them have criminal records.
That much I guessed.
But one of them is particularly interesting.
Pull up James Baker's rap sheet.
He spent time in juvenile detention for attempted murder,
was released at age 21,
他的作案顺序是
armed robbery, petty theft,
burglary, narcotics sales,
and rape.
没有性侵犯的指控
Absolutely nothing.
I told you it was interesting.
What's so interesting about that?
When it comes to psychological behavior
anything is possible but
简直就是天方夜谭
I mean, as a minor,he began with attempted murder
and then devolved into pettier crimes?
It's the criminal history of a fractured schizophrenic with
multiple personality disorder.
It just does not make sense.
Unless someone made that rap sheet up
and they weren't thinking about the behavior,
they just plugged in whatever sounded good.
Hold on.
His mug shot's coming up.
I got an address for you to hit.
Clear.
收到
It's clear here.
Morgan, this is weird.
There's nothing here.
It's like nobody lives here.
I guess he wasn't expecting company.
我知道
Look at this place.
It's an artificial dwelling...
to match an artificial past.
Come on, Josh.
怎么了
We got a hot weapon.
Oh, no.
It's a Glock 19.
And this round
is standard law enforcement issue.
So you're saying Baker's an undercover cop.
I'm saying I did 18 months deep cover
and this place has got all the makings of a crash pad.
All right, where is he?
No, no, he is not here.
Baker's missing.
I told him we'd pick him up at 8:00.
Damn it, damn it, damn it, Jimmy, where the hell are you?
Get in, get in. Come on, let's go.
What the hell is wrong with you people?
Sorry?
I told you, this is my case?
First of all, don't shout at me.
行为分析组接手哪些案子
查我手下的佩枪
Because I wanted to know who he worked for
and now that I do,I'd like to talk to him.
You don't have him.
No.
You don't know where he is?
He's missing.
快12小时了
Before or after the murders?
You think Jimmy's a suspect?
There's a sketch of someone
who looks an awful lot like him leaving the scene.
That's because he was there.
After.
Look, he ran into a couple of Baltimore detectives
and they made him while he was with Condore.
Jimmy tried to play it off but
he didn't think that Condore had bought it
so he wanted to go back and talk to him.
When he saw what was left of the Dimarcos,
he called us for a pickup. We showed up.
He didn't.
You think he ran?
吉米很有经验肯定会事先联系
说明他被抓了
Who's Jimmy Baker's target?
Michael Russo.
We've been after the guy for 3 years
Jimmy's been under for almost 2.
We talked to Russo yesterday.
He seemed genuinely surprised by the murders.
And you bought that?
是什么货色吧
The guy is a liar, and a good one.
他肯定也知道是谁干的
你们根本就是木鱼脑袋不开窍
Agent Cramer, we're not the enemy.
Please sit down.
We're dealing with a very dangerous killer here...
and we need your help.
You know these people better than we do.
This guy...
if he is what you say he is and he has Jimmy,
did he kill him already?
We don't know.
I'll help you in any way that I can.
You help me get this man back to his family.
Who knows about me, Jimmy?
What did you tell them?
Nothing.
Nothing.
I promise. Nothing.
I think you're a liar and a rat.
Oh, please...
You're gonna need a bigger board.
Please tell me you brought some breakfast.
Trust me, sugar,
you are not going to want to eat when you see what's in here.
How many more are there?
Well, I've gone back 15 years
and there's over 100.
100 unsolved murders.
还有更多资料送过来
Well, the torture's consistent.
You know, we thought this guy might have been at it a while
but this many victims, Garcia?
John Wayne Gacy killed at least 30 people.
This guy's more than tripled that.
Yeah, but this guy gets paid for it. He's a hit man.
No.
He's more than that.
Not all these victims were mob hits.
My guess is he probably started hunting when he was really young.
perfected his craft,
moved on to bigger prey.
Hey, Garcia, look at this.
There's no hesitation wounds on the body.
One clean cut through flesh and bone.
Ok, so what does that tell us?
Most people wouldn't imagine doing something like this
but this guy, he doesn't even flinch.
He's got no conscience.
We've got ourselves a serial killer with the perfect career.
自己惹上的是什么人
I think we can shake him. Keep looking.
How can I help you, agents?
We're worried about you.
What's causing you to lose sleep?
We hear you didn't order that hit on Freddy.
I told you I had nothing to do with that.
Why don't you take a look in that folder?
It looks like you must have a problem within your organization.
Is that right?
So your hitter doesn't just kill for a paycheck
He kills for pleasure.
It's what makes him good at what he does.
He's paranoid,he's a psychopath, and
he's free-lancing.
这已经引起各方关注了
And you can't control him.
That's what he did to Freddy's uncle.
Russo,
if he's not a problem for you now, he will be.
What if you let me worry about that?
Russo.
I just got a question for you.
How do you think your paranoid little killer's gonna feel about
他会作何感想
Just a thought.
Success.
对他的杀手起疑心了
没错
What if by playing them against each other
we made Russo as paranoid as his hit man.
What would stop them from trying to kill each other?
If that happens,
then we'll never find Jimmy Baker alive.
We got a surveillance team outside of Russo's office.
Stay on it.
Is this gonna work?
声波会从玻璃窗反射
Yeah, the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.
Is it gonna work?
Hey. It's me.
I need to see you tonight.
I'll call you from a secure line.
Apparently.
Listen, you brought a lot of heat
taking down Freddy like that.
What? I'm dealing with the feds.
Listen!
Meet me here at the office.
They don't know nothin'.
I'm dealing with them.
Stop being paranoid, Vinnie.
Bingo.
No. Vinnie.
It's pretty remarkable, really.
Nature's got her own cleanup crew.
Flies, larvae, maggots, beetles.
Then there's the big guys, of course.
Rats, squirrels, crows, buzzards.
不要在海拔五千英尺处杀人
It's cold up there.
The evidence tends to linger.
They'll be along soon.
They like the scent of blood.
Please...
Russo's got 11 associates named Vincent.
No, make that 10.
Vincent Cellito died last summer.
Here is something.
What can you tell me about Vincent Sartori?
I was still drinking that.
Not only is this equipment expensive
it's also extremely sensitive.
Vincent Sartori.
Currently doing 6 at Dannemora for racketeering.
How about this Perotta? There's not much on him.
Can you get into those records?
Despite the fact that they were probably expunged
she can find the faintest echo of deletion and
and successfully recreate the file thereby
sending us all to prison for computer felony fraud counts.
We can make bail. Garcia?
Already in.
Alcohol addiction at 14.
Violent outbursts. Assaults.
Once threw a molotov cocktail at someone sitting in their car.
Several notations for aggression.
And he once scheduled a visit to an infirmary
to gain access to a boy who looked at him for too long?
No fear. No remorse.
Quick temper.
And he was smart enough to stay off the radar as an adult.
Paranoid personality. He could be our guy.
There's absolutely no information on him as an adult.
什么都没有
It's like he became a ghost.
Let's just hope they can catch him.
Remember,
收到
It's all clear.
Nothing.
Hotch.
Hotch, let me take him?
Gideon, I got a head shot at that sick.
Don't take it. We need him alive.
You Okay?
Take your tie off for once in your life.
It's all right.
There's a van around the corner.
Looks like blood all over.
It's being processed right now.
Whatever they find they're going to send it over to Quantico.
They got Jimmy's jacket.
Take off.
We don't have time for this little show.
Interrogation techniques say make the guy comfortable
make him your friend.
Give him a way out. That's how you get a confession.
That may work with a common criminal.
It's not gonna work here.
Why is that?
Because anti-social personality disorder means
都绝不相信任何人
Then what are you supposed to do?
Make him uncomfortable.
This was all in his van?
Yep. The guy wasn't exactly neat.
Classic anti-social personality.
What are these tapes?
I don't know.
然后告诉我们 行吗
Yeah. Movie night. I'll make popcorn.
我没事
He's got a little slack.
If Morgan says he's secure, he's secure.
什么
Let's not give him a weapon.
He's kind of strong.
什么
好吧
I'm Supervisory Special Agent Jason Gideon.
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
You're afraid of me, Jason?
You were advised of your rights?
Take these off and we'll really talk.
Were you advised of your rights?
I know my rights.
You want to talk?
I got nothin' to hide.
Good.
别拿背对着他 吉迪恩
Hotch, you know how he is.
这家伙吓不倒他
It's not about fear. It's about being dismissive.
Perotta could assume that he's disrespecting him.
Why don't we turn these cameras off?
I'll get him to tell us where Jimmy is.
That wouldn't work.
You sure about that?
Yeah. He was probably abused by one or both of his parents.
He's learned to take the pain.
And that's why he has no compassion for anyone else's.
You gotta trust us.
You're not organized crime.
No.
We're behavioral analysis.
What's that mean?
以及你的行为原因
No kidding?
We have a word for you.
You got a word for me?
Oh, yeah. Actually, we have a few.
Psychopath.
Paranoid personality disorder.
That's quite a mouthful, Jason.
Yes, it is.
Michael Russo set me up, didn't he?
Do you recognize this man?
No.
How about them?
Anyone look familiar?
Wait a minute. The third guy over.
I think he does those late night commercials for the dead worms.
You know, softies.
That's funny to you?
It's just interesting that you'd choose that expression.
You have problems performing?
Not me.
Where's he going with this?
There's no evidence this guy can't perform.
I know Gideon knows that. He's just...
Pushing his buttons.
Does murder excite you?
Is it the only thing that can give you a sexual release?
Vincent.
I believe you're an extremely impotent man.
看我怎么个"无能"法
Where's Jimmy, you son of a bitch?
He's a federal agent?
I will personally execute you? Personally?
Baker is a federal agent. I knew it.
Where is he, Vincent?
Hey, Jason.
你还会叫我偏执狂吗
这里面全是裸女们和水管工的故事
What?
Never mind.
Ok, who's that?
I have no idea.
Put another tape in.
Oh, my God.
I'll be back.
What the hell is wrong with you?
We don't have time for this, all right?
生命危在旦夕
You just told him Baker was a federal agent.
He may never tell us now.
I told him to hang tough.
What?
Jimmy.
我让他继续执行任务
that we didn't need to bring him in right away.
Hey, I had too much invested, all right? Too much time.
And I wanted Russo.
So we waited 24 hours to go in for him.
By the time we got there, that maniac...
there's a chance agent Baker's being tortured
and I think I know how.
After you.
Oh, my God.
No.
是的
中发现的新受害者
Check with local PDs.
现有相关的谋杀和失踪报告
没错
What are we gonna do?
We looked at all the stuff in the van.
And beside the videotapes there's nothing that interesting.
I got Garcia going over the sound on the tapes
trying to isolate the background noise.
好消息是
It seems like they were all filmed in the same space.
It could be some sort of home base for him
Yeah, but where is it?
What do we know about Vincent Perotta?
He's off the grid.
Garcia can't find a registered phone
utility bill, or home address on this hump.
总会留下蛛丝马迹
If there is, we can't find it.
想要完全与世隔绝是不可能的
Unless someone pays your bills for you.
What about Russo?
不 不可能
Russo's not paying anybody's bills but his own.
He has to have a weakness.
It's in his crime.
It's in his behavior.
You know, something's just been bugging me.
Freddy.
Wasn't he easy to find?
He cut up the body.
He removed it from the crime scene.
But then he leaves it a couple of blocks away
where's he's gotta know we're gonna find it.
让我们找到了佩罗塔
He made a mistake.
Yeah, he did. He went off script.
定是半路杀出了程咬金
That's right.
His behavior.
Well, what does he do?
He tortures.
Always?
The difference is Mrs. Dimarco.
Right.
没错
Keep working.
Hey, look who's here. My old friend. Feeling better?
Where's Jason?
看似平常和睦的家庭长大的 对吗
Did I?
But your father beat you every chance he got.
谁家老爸不这样
No.
你就不会那么不堪一击了
There.
Did you hear that?
What is that?
I don't know.
I think it's moving.
Getting closer.
Airplane.
Paranoid personalities develop in childhood.
You know, you're saving me thousands of dollars in therapy bills.
You learned to take the beatings, the abuse.
You learned to smile.
But in the back of your mind you probably thought...
"one day...
one day when I'm big enough."
So you were bullied and abused
and you became an abuser and a bully.
It's a logical progression.
没错
Your father beat your mother too, didn't he?
My mother's got nothing to do with this.
吃这么多东西
Anyone who spends hours and hours in it waiting...
hunting.
Look.
Weird.
This is crazy. There's not one address,
no paperwork, no registration.
It's all garbage.
Pizza boxes...
nasty-looking chinese food, and...
等等 披萨
What about it?
Where do you order your pizza from?
I get my pizza from my own neighborhood.
Frenetti's.
Your mother knew.
She knew that he beat you every day
and she did nothing to help you.
And you still loved her.
Even though she let you get hurt, you loved her.
And I wondered why.
Why you didn't hate her.
Then of course I realized that
that he beat her as much as he beat you.
Don't talk about my mother.
You killed all these people,
hundreds of them,and only one woman.
That's what made you get sloppy, isn't it?
Killing Mrs. Dimarco was hard.
That's why you killed her first and you made it quick.
但其实不然
He was a bastard, all right?
我只叫他弗兰克
He was a mean son of a bitch.
Is that what you want to know?
Gideon. I think we got something here.
He's got a bunch of pizza boxes from Frenetti's pizza.
It's in Glen Burnie.
A suburb that backs up right to the airport.
所以带子的背景声里有飞机声
Check property records for Frank Perotta.
他父亲
Why?
He still lives in his father's house.
I'll get Garcia on it.
That's why nothing is in his name.
如你所料 就在格伦伯尼
死于一起可疑的打猎事故
With his son.
How long ago?
30 years. He was 17.
And my guess is it was no accident.
Well, you said Vincent was looking for bigger prey.
加西亚
you're my girl. Thank you.
Clear.
Clear.
Kitchen's clear.
安全
We got a friendly! It's Baker!
叫救护车
Jimmy, you all right, man?
Is he okay?
He's gonna live.
Get out.
You gonna be all right, Jimmy.
You were just responding to what you learned, Vincent.
When you grow up in an environment like that,
an extremely abusive, violent household,
这不足为奇
Some people?
What's up?
You said some people grow up to become killers.
And some people grow up to catch them.
Carl Jung said,
"The healthy man does not torture others.
Generally it is the tortured
who turn into torturers."
