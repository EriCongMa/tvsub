come here !
on your knees , burt .
this is how the world ends .
someone begs , and someone stands over him with a gun .
welcome back to talking at noon .
wow , a rough episode .
now , we &apos;re gonna talk all things darkness at noon in just a sec ,
but first , spoiler alert .
sam is dead , john was arrested ,
linda gave birth , miguel did look at the flowers ,
and the yellow arm was moved .
badass stuff . your thoughts , carmen ?
i was blown away . i mean ....
... every assumption i had was turned upside down .
come on in .
would you like a glass of wine ? red or white ?
no , i &apos;m fine .
you &apos;ve really been working overtime .
well , i didn &apos;t know if you &apos;d eaten .
maybe i will have a glass of wine . red .
nervous ?
well , we &apos;re just talking , right ?
it doesn &apos;t mean anything .
right , right . you can always say &quot; no . &quot;
the election is in eight months , the debates in six ,
and the candidate announcement , monday .
this monday ?
yes . that &apos;s the filing deadline .
eli , that &apos;s in four days .
yes , but the good news is
that we &apos;re ready to go .
we have a plan in place , we &apos;ve done some initial polling .
alicia , things just move faster now . they just do .
you have the polling ?
yes . if the election were held today ,
and the only candidates were you and castro ...
you would win by eight points .
so you think it &apos;ll just be me and castro ?
alicia , alicia , just wait a minute .
you have to hear these things first .
eight points .
you would win by eight points .
yes .
that &apos;s good , right ?
that &apos;s not just good .
that &apos;s remarkable .
that kind of gap just doesn &apos;t exist in cook county .
i just don &apos;t think it lasts . good news tends not to last .
and that &apos;s what i like about you .
you &apos;re always looking for the bad .
but there are so many disasters in a campaign
that you have to acknowledge the non @-@ disasters when they happen .
good .
but people don &apos;t really know me yet .
and castro will try to define me .
yes . before you define yourself .
go after the clients i represent .
correct . you &apos;re a brand now . saint alicia .
eli , i wish you would say that
with at least a hint of irony .
no . irony is dead now . you &apos;re campaigning .
jfk could be funny . you can &apos;t .
there &apos;s too many bloggers out
there quoting every ironic comment as truth .
okay . &quot; stop joking . &quot;
good .
another part of your brand is that you stood by your husband .
six years ago .
yes , but that image of you beside him
is still bumping around the internet .
you look better now . people like that .
you survived , you prospered .
you ... didn &apos;t divorce .
i know , but
people don &apos;t need to see the messiness .
but castro will make them see the messiness .
yes , but he has to be careful ,
or he &apos;ll look like a bully .
he knows he can &apos;t go too far ,
&apos;cause we have some oppo research of our own .
such as ?
let &apos;s not get ahead of ourselves .
oh , yeah , right .
i invited your campaign manager over so you can meet him .
what ? ! wait . eli , you &apos;re my campaign manager .
no , you need someone full @-@ time . i &apos;m peter &apos;s chief of staff .
no , i can &apos;t . i &apos;m ... uh ...
who is it ? i mean , if i do decide to run ?
johnny elfman . you &apos;ll like him .
he &apos;s a top campaign op .
he consulted on the obama 2012 win .
he turned around ohio .
eli , wait . no .
okay , listen .
you know i said things move faster now ? that &apos;s this .
talk to him , meet him , question him .
this is his job interview .
if you don &apos;t like him , just pull me aside after 20 minutes ,
and say he &apos;s not for you , and we &apos;ll keep looking .
20 minutes ?
i have to answer the door now .
no . i will .
hi . i &apos;m alicia florrick .
uh , johnny elfman .
can i get you some wine , mr. elfman ?
no . thank you . i &apos;m fine . is @-@ is eli ... ?
here , johnny .
eli , do you have a second ?
would you excuse us , mrs. florrick ?
eli .
what the hell ?
you said you &apos;d listen to her .
no , i said i &apos;d listen to you . i thought this was your apartment .
well , you &apos;re here now . just listen to her .
if you don &apos;t like her , in 20 minutes ,
just pull me aside , and say &quot; no , thanks . &quot;
i hate her .
the wife ?
why ? she &apos;s just trying to protect him .
演员 / 喜剧表演者
because she took his guns .
she wants him not to be normal , not a badass ...
《 美国谍梦 》 主创
i just think she &apos;s so repressed , she had to do something like this .
oh , she &apos;s definitely repressed , but ...
this is so disrespectful . you &apos;re trying to get me pregnant with her .
i knew you &apos;d just say &quot; no &quot; if you didn &apos;t meet her .
she &apos;s a first @-@ timer .
i &apos;m finished with first @-@ timers .
they @-@ they have lives . they have ...
hi .
mr. gold , hey . is my mom here ?
hi , grace . yes .
they have kids .
what &apos;s going on ?
i have school choir tonight . i told you .
okay , um , i need you to do it in your room , okay ?
okay . love you .
everything all right , gentlemen ?
should we do this another time ?
no . john just had some questions , but now they &apos;re answered , right ?
yeah .
the plan is a speech on the steps of the courthouse ,
the governor introducing you ,
then you speaking for five minutes introducing yourself .
isn &apos;t it a mistake to use peter ?
won &apos;t it look like i &apos;m in his shadow ?
no . the only way your story ...
i will trust in the lord , i will trust in the lord
i will trust in the lord ...
the only way your story gets traction is a good visual .
they &apos;ll show the old shot of you standing by peter in disgrace .
then this new shot of peter standing by you in triumph .
that &apos;s the story .
what do you think , mr. elfman ?
about ?
about what eli just said .
uh , i &apos;m reserving judgment .
it doesn &apos;t seem like there &apos;s time to reserve judgment .
and yet here i am , reserving it .
anyway , our first strategic move is embracing the governor .
peter brings in the big bucks ,
and also reminds voters of your constancy ...
why do you want to run , mrs. florrick ?
excuse me ?
why do you want to run for state &apos;s attorney , mrs. florrick ?
because the current state &apos;s attorney is using the office politically .
and how is he doing that ?
he &apos;s prosecuting people , not because they &apos;ve done anything wrong ,
but because he doesn &apos;t like them ,
or he doesn &apos;t like the people associated with them .
and how would you ... ?
i &apos;m not finished yet .
do you want me to finish ?
there has been more corruption in the current state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office
than at any point since ...
since your husband ?
do you have an issue with me , mr. elfman ?
i don &apos;t even know you , ma &apos;am .
do you have an issue with my running ?
there is always a point during the campaign where
i &apos;m not proud of myself .
where i &apos;ve lied to a reporter ,
or smeared an innocent bystander ,
or badgered a friend into giving money .
but i do it willingly because i believe in the candidate ,
mrs. florrick , so , yes , i have an issue with you
or anyone who considers running .
are you up to it ? because i &apos;m not some dilettante ...
neither am i.
i build my life on winning .
on hating the enemy and loving my candidate .
i &apos;ve got it .
i &apos;m not your superhero , mr. elfman .
you want to go find someone to restore your faith in humanity ,
don &apos;t waste my time , or yours .
mom , it &apos;s for you . it &apos;s work .
it was nice to meet you , mr. elfman .
well ?
what &apos;s up ? i @-@ i don &apos;t understand . what happened ?
it &apos;s bishop . he got a subpoena .
for what ?
all records associated with his real estate holdings .
well , that &apos;s good .
there &apos;s nothing wrong with his real estate holdings .
right , which is why we comply with the subpoena .
bishop is our client ...
they &apos;re not after bishop . they &apos;re after me .
we don &apos;t know that .
and it doesn &apos;t matter .
it does matter .
wait ! bishop &apos;s innocent , right ?
of the real estate charge , yes .
they say he failed to pay real estate taxes
on property used for commercial purposes .
okay , then we comply .
there &apos;s nothing there ,
so we should show the state &apos;s attorney there &apos;s nothing there .
alicia , they only want us to comply ,
so they can use that precedent
in front of a judge in my criminal case .
it &apos;s the camel nose under the tent .
grace sent up the bat signal .
sure . in her room .
you &apos;re saying every housewife is the same .
that &apos;s not what i &apos;m saying .
come on !
who @-@ who was that ?
i have no idea .
it &apos;s like a marx brothers movie in here .
it doesn &apos;t matter , cary ! he &apos;s our client .
we can &apos;t favor you over him , or him over you .
see ? see ? tough cookie .
hi . no , it &apos;s going very well . yes .
no , i @-@ i haven &apos;t shown that to her yet .
you haven &apos;t shown her the opposition research ? why not ?
because you don &apos;t start with the dirt .
you end with it . same thing i did with you .
how dirty is it ?
i can &apos;t tell you that , peter .
this is for alicia , not you .
anything about me in there ?
we can &apos;t do this , peter .
i &apos;m not her campaign manager . talk to him .
oh , uh , who &apos;d you get , by the way ?
uh , johnny elfman .
johnny elfman ?
i thought he was in ohio .
he was in ohio , but he wanted to broaden his scope .
to a state &apos;s attorney &apos;s race ?
well , to this state &apos;s attorney &apos;s race .
how &apos;s he looking these days ?
uh , elfman ? what do you mean ?
oh , i heard he was in a motorcycle accident .
scar on his face or something like that .
i can &apos;t see anything . uh , i got to go .
uh , listen , i want to be kept in the loop on this .
i understand .
yes , but all of your rationales for running were negative .
they were all about what the current state &apos;s attorney &apos;s doing wrong .
that &apos;s because he ...
yes , but you need to find a positive reason for running .
give me an example .
why did you get into law ?
i like clarity .
i like rules that tell me what &apos;s right and wrong .
and you wanted to help people with those rules ?
no .
i know i &apos;m supposed to say &quot; yes , &quot;
but i just wanted to be inside something that made sense to me .
i never thought about ...
people ?
yeah .
maybe don &apos;t put that in the stump speech .
okay .
&quot; okay &quot; what ?
okay , johnny needs to take you through the opposition research .
the research of castro ?
uh , no , of you .
the skeletons in my closet ?
yes .
that &apos;s a lot of skeletons .
you ever seen the matrix ?
yes .
remember when they show keanu
a red pill and a blue one , and if he takes the red pill ,
he &apos;ll keep going down the rabbit hole ?
yeah .
this is the red pill .
what &apos;s the blue pill ?
you tell us you don &apos;t want to run .
let &apos;s go .
第六季 第四集
your clients .
i know . colin sweeney and lemond bishop .
and the paisley group .
why the paisley group ?
mr. paisley spoke out on israel .
and that matters in a state &apos;s attorney &apos;s race ?
israel matters in every race .
but won &apos;t it look opportunistic
if i just drop them as clients ?
yes . which is why you only drop bishop .
he &apos;s the one that hurts you the most
and there &apos;s reason to drop him .
the firm &apos;s representation of your law partner
means you &apos;re conflicted out , right ?
right .
good . so we need that to happen
before the announcement .
i &apos;ll meet with him tomorrow .
okay , good . now , your son , zach .
he got his girlfriend , nisa dalmar ,
pregnant last year and they had an abortion .
now , there &apos;s nothing much to be done about it as a campaign issue ,
but you should be prepared for questions .
mostly because when the abortion happened
he was 17 and she was 16,
and because she &apos;s muslim .
alicia , we don &apos;t want to bring these things up ,
but we &apos;re just afraid
you &apos;re gonna be sandbagged during the campaign .
it &apos;s the working mother question .
were your children unsupervised while you were at work ?
it &apos;s sexist , i know ,
but you may get hit with that from the conservative press .
you &apos;re ... how do you know this ?
is this a @-@ a campaign smear ?
yes , but we can &apos;t deny it , unfortunately .
why ?
because it happened .
when ?
last year .
august .
what day ?
august 5 .
how do you know ?
we have a record from the abortion clinic .
do you know how many months pregnant ?
no .
she was 16 . she was a minor ?
yes .
did they have the abortion in illinois ?
yes .
the parents of a minor have to be notified in illinois .
yes , and they were .
i know this is hard , mrs. florrick ,
but everything that you &apos;re feeling now
will be used against you later .
so it &apos;s important to inure yourself .
i &apos;m sorry . tell me when you &apos;re ready to move on .
i &apos;m sorry , i need to make a phone call .
alicia , you can &apos;t .
i &apos;ll be right back .
are you calling your son ?
that &apos;s none of your business .
if you get his voice mail , you can &apos;t leave a message--
nothing specific-- it can be used against you .
hey . what &apos;s up ?
our son had an abortion . did you know that ?
what ?
did zach tell you he had an abortion ? on august 5 .
when he was supposed to be touring colleges in boston .
wait , where are you hearing this from ?
opposition research . what do you think ?
uh , no , no , he never said anything .
we &apos;re cutting him off without a cent , you know that .
he can buy his own frigging way though college .
or get nisa &apos;s parents to do it .
nisa ? not becca ?
august 5 . nisa .
every time he &apos;s been lying to me .
&quot; it &apos;s all in your head , mom .
i don &apos;t smoke pot , mom .
i &apos;m a good boy . &quot; well , let &apos;s see how he deals .
all right , alicia , listen to me .
don &apos;t you dare tell me to calm down .
he lied to me .
i know , i &apos;m sorry .
but i want you to let me talk to him .
no .
this one &apos;s mine .
you &apos;ve reached zach &apos;s voice mail .
i &apos;m in class right now or sleeping it off .
leave a message .
zach ...
it &apos;s mom .
call me back .
you have kids ?
no .
no time .
so what does the elk symbolize ?
oh , easy-- the soul of michael ,
rising from the dead , reincarnated .
his master &apos;s voice .
mr. governor . good evening .
you told alicia that zach got an abortion ?
yes .
why ?
because he did .
eli , this is becoming ...
yes ?
are you gonna bring up the intern ?
i can &apos;t tell you that , mr. governor .
eli ,
i &apos;m not sleeping with her .
i understand that ,
but oppo research is not just about what &apos;s true .
it &apos;s about where we &apos;re vulnerable .
listen , eli ,
you bring her up ,
and it becomes a thing .
and i cannot deal with any more things .
i got to go .
i will deal with this here .
lauren will not be an issue in alicia &apos;s campaign , okay ?
i &apos;ll talk to you , mr. governor .
peter ?
asking how you knew about zach ?
yeah .
you , uh , sure you want to continue , mrs. florrick ?
we can stop right here .
why ? let &apos;s do it . i &apos;m inured .
okay . well , there are some issues
with your brother and your mom .
of course there are .
gay support--
especially financial support--
it matters to your campaign .
that &apos;s why your brother &apos;s actions matter .
what &apos;d he do ?
well , he &apos;s been having an affair with a married palestinian man
who also does barebacked gay porn under the name phil .
i don &apos;t know how to answer that .
it &apos;s the affair with a married man that &apos;s the most problematic .
well , that and the barebacked gay porn .
yeah , and the porn . yeah .
these issues tend to create a division
within the gay community .
i will trust in the lord
i will trust in the lord
so you want me to break up
the affair with the palestinian ?
no . it &apos;s just owen has a tendency to talk .
and castro will have video trackers .
it &apos;s boston college , mom . i have to go see it .
really , it means a lot to me .
the story could get pinned to any visual--
pixilated gay porn ...
we need him to lay low for a little while .
okay .
talk to zach and owen .
now , mom .
what about mom ?
she hit a child in a department store .
what ?
a five @-@ year @-@ old child , uh ,
greg weymouth . veronica took him over her knee
and , uh ... spanked him .
why would she do that ?
i don &apos;t know . but there &apos;s videotape .
there &apos;s videotape of her hitting a child ?
we just need her to apologize to the family .
fend off any possible suits .
okay .
talk to mom about hitting children .
next .
what about grace ? what did she do ?
turning tricks after school ?
well , actually ...
no , that was a joke .
grace is good .
christianity 3 , atheism 0 .
uh , yes ,
talking of atheism ...
i know .
if you need to talk about religion--
and you shouldn &apos;t talk about religion--
just say you &apos;re struggling .
just say you &apos;re an agnostic
who &apos;s struggling .
right , i &apos;ll get on that .
anything else ?
i will trust in the lord
i will trust in the lord
well , now it &apos;s time to turn to you , mrs. florrick .
your issues .
can &apos;t wait .
yes . this is a photo of me with my boss , will gardner ,
at a hotel reception desk researching a case .
a rape case .
can you substantiate that ?
well , will &apos;s dead . so not from him .
but i &apos;m sure you can from the clerk there .
do you remember her name ?
it was five years ago .
but i can look back in my files .
that would be good , thank you . and ...
how about this ?
isn &apos;t it lovely
how your whole life gets documented ?
i lived for 13 years in highland park in complete obscurity .
going to lunches with my tennis friends ,
picking up the kids from school ,
drinking a glass of wine at 5 : 00 .
and no one cared .
no one bothered to look in on me .
now people care .
it almost gives you a warm feeling .
castro intends to use this .
use what ?
that photo ?
the time stamp reads 8 : 27 a.m. ,
and mr. polmar is leaving your apartment .
yes , well ,
i don &apos;t like my kids seeing who i sleep with .
how could they get out in time for their abortions ?
okay , remember what i said about irony during campaigns ?
i was taking finn through his testimony that morning
for his s.a. disciplinary panel .
and he &apos;ll back you up on this ?
it &apos;s the truth .
it &apos;s our understanding , mrs. florrick ,
that he &apos;s prosecuting your law partner ,
and that you have fought ...
in court .
and that he was asked to run
and then forced to quit before you decided to run .
what &apos;s that ?
talk to zach , owen , mom and finn polmar .
see if any of them plan to screw me over .
and lemond bishop .
right .
and fire him as a client . anything else ?
yes . the governor has a few ...
that &apos;s okay , john .
that @-@ that &apos;s enough for now .
no , what is it ?
we just want to do a little more digging
before we present you with this .
if it &apos;s about peter , i &apos;m ready .
it &apos;s okay .
is it about kalinda ?
what ?
is it about kalinda &apos;s one @-@ night stand with peter ?
because i know about that already .
uh , who &apos;s kalinda ?
she &apos;s an investigator
who used to work in the s.a. &apos; s office .
she slept with my husband .
now she works at my firm .
do we have that one ?
we &apos;ll look into it .
kalinda won &apos;t talk ,
but if you &apos;re worried about
what might complicate my campaign ...
let us do our job .
i &apos;ll look into it , okay ?
okay .
well , this was fun .
you &apos;ve passed basic training , mrs. florrick .
are you running ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m still contemplating .
you have till monday to decide .
if it &apos;s any consolation , mrs. florrick , uh ...
alicia .
anyone who &apos;s pawed through my underwear drawer
should really call me by my first name .
alicia . i &apos;ve sat through 18 of these
&quot; come to jesus &quot; moments with candidates ,
and you &apos;ve handled it the best .
great . thank you .
nice meeting you , mrs. florrick .
you , too , mr. elfman .
there are so many badasses in this show .
what ?
you got sam , michael , gifford ...
there &apos;s only one badass .
no , no , no , no .
he thinks he &apos;s a badass .
you know who &apos;s really the badass ?
oh , my god .
whoa , whoa , whoa . and isn &apos;t the whole point
that the @-@ the badass is the guy with the gun ?
big badass . capital ...
hi .
hello .
what &apos;s up ?
we &apos;ve received your subpoena .
the subpoena for your real estate holdings .
we believe it &apos;s a good idea to comply with this subpoena .
good . i would agree .
we &apos;ve done nothing wrong .
that &apos;s right . but ,
um , we have run into a bit of a problem .
what problem ?
we can &apos;t represent you anymore .
why not ?
i think i &apos;d better leave for this discussion .
we represent cary .
he &apos;s being prosecuted because of his relationship with you ,
and we &apos;re having difficulty representing both of you .
why is that ?
well ... we believe that this ...
real estate attack by the s.a.
is purely a trojan horse to get at cary .
i don &apos;t understand .
if we comply with the s.a. subpoena ,
we think they intend to use that compliance
as a precedent in cary &apos;s case .
that &apos;s why we &apos;re suggesting you change representation .
this is a list of five firms that we recommend .
and they are all willing-- no , excited--
to take you on . and we can get you on the phone with them .
uh , mr. bishop , it &apos;s best for your business
that you work with another firm .
no .
the problem is , mr. bishop ,
the state &apos;s attorney is taking advantage
of our conflict of interests .
we need you to consider another firm .
no . but thank you .
is there anything else ?
mr. bishop ,
i &apos;m gonna have to go to the judge to remove myself .
do it .
i &apos;ll say i need you as my attorney .
who do you think the judge will listen to ?
yes ?
did you want to ask me something ?
did you sleep with peter ?
that &apos;s why we &apos;re meeting here
and not in your office ?
now i understand why there was so much tension
between you and peter .
did alicia say ... ?
no .
did peter say ... ?
no .
why are you asking ?
alicia &apos;s running for state &apos;s attorney . i need to know
where my land mines are .
well , this is not a land mine .
really ?
peter florrick sleeps with you
while you &apos;re working at the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office .
then he sleeps with prostitutes , while you become alicia &apos;s best friend .
well , not best friend .
uh , out of all those things i just said ,
you find objectionable the best friend charge ?
so you slept with him ?
eli , let me put this to you another way .
you have nothing to worry about .
kalinda ,
i treat you with respect because i know that you know
what my job entails .
there is nothing that will bite me in the ass here ?
nothing .
unless you ask me again ,
there is nothing .
believe me ,
this is the last lunch i wanted to have .
good .
then we &apos;re okay .
so now we have to wait for lunch ?
or we could just go .
without ordering or paying ?
yeah .
you don &apos;t think it &apos;s weird that she invited us both
to her apartment at the same time ?
she wants something .
well , maybe she &apos;s pregnant again .
she wants me to be the godfather .
god , what a frightening thought that would be .
no , she wants money or something .
wait , why is that a frightening thought ?
oh . yay .
here we all are ,
together .
family .
it &apos;s good to see you both .
have you read the goldfinch ?
it &apos;s such beautiful writing .
it &apos;s all about art and life .
so , you &apos;re probably wondering
why i needed to meet with you ...
no ...
i &apos;m thinking of running for state &apos;s attorney .
and i needed to talk to you
about a few dos and don &apos;ts regarding talking to the press .
you &apos;re what ?
running .
for state &apos;s attorney .
why ?
i think i could do a good job of it .
how does this work with you being a lawyer ?
well , i &apos;ll still have my ongoing cases
that i &apos;ll be involved with during my campaign .
but if you win , you &apos;ll have to quit .
yes , i &apos;ll be state &apos;s attorney .
where does this come from , alicia ?
so here &apos;s what i need from you two .
my team worries that there are
some issues in your life-- both your lives ...
&quot; my team &quot; ?
you &apos;re @-@ you &apos;re already talking about a team ?
why not just take a trip ? you &apos;d love bali .
this is empty nest syndrome .
you know , i read this great book about it ...
mom , did you hit a kid
in a department store ?
what ?
did you hit a five @-@ year @-@ old kid named greg weymouth
in browards &apos; dress department ?
that &apos;s crazy .
where &apos;d you hear that ?
it was videotaped .
wait , are you kidding ?
this is fantastic .
it was a spanking . i didn &apos;t hit him .
well , his parents are thinking of suing .
i was doing them a favor .
that kid was running around the store , yelling .
he was knocking over things . it was ...
a public service .
yes . even though you &apos;re making fun of me , it was .
well , i set up an appointment with the parents .
i need you to apologize .
no .
they should apologize to me .
i was doing them a favor .
mom , i need you to do this for me .
it will become a news item .
now , owen ...
what ? um , what did i do ?
why don &apos;t you join me in the kitchen .
wait ,
why does owen get privacy and i didn &apos;t ?
because mine &apos;s way worse .
they just discovered the body .

leaving my apartment 8 : 30 a.m.
on march 18 .
really ?
is it a good photo ?
depends .
were we up to something naughty ?
witness prep .
disgusting .
thanks .
if they ask you about it , finn ,
you &apos;d say it was about the disciplinary hearing ?
you mean the truth ? sure .
unless you want me to say i stayed the night .
probably not .
sorry . i &apos;m in a funny mood . i don &apos;t know why .
i @-@ i know ... i know why . because , uh ...
i thought that maybe there &apos;d be some tension between us
because ...
you &apos;re trying to put my partner in prison ?
yeah . kind of has a way of putting a crimp in a friendship .
and i thought there &apos;d be tension because ...
i &apos;m thinking about running .
no .
i think it &apos;s great . honestly .
i &apos;m glad you called .
come on . take a cab .
drink with me . what &apos;s wrong with you ?
i &apos;d better not .

more witness prep ?

you &apos;ve reached zach &apos;s voice mail .
i &apos;m in class right now or sleeping it off .
leave a message .
zach , it &apos;s mom . something &apos;s come up . call me tomorrow .
oh , no . no .
one glass of wine . that &apos;s all .
pull to the side of the road .
good evening , mrs. florrick .
have you been drinking ?
how did you know my name ?
please step out of the car , ma &apos;am .
nine steps forward , ma &apos;am .
turn on the line , nine steps back .
i &apos;ve ... i &apos;ve already agreed to a breathalyzer test .
yes , you said that , ma &apos;am . i need you to turn on the line ,
nine steps back .
i have admitted to having one glass of wine ,
which would make my bac well below the legal limit .
this is called a horizontal gaze nystagmus test .
i need you to follow my flashlight .
hello . what &apos;s wrong ?
i was just pulled over , eli .
damn it . for a dui .
oh , my god . where are you ?
i &apos;m in my car . i passed .
i only had one glass of wine . but ...
i think it was a setup .
why ?
because i volunteered a breathalyzer ,
but he insisted on a roadside test .
okay , i &apos;ll keep an eye on the blogs .
good . call me .
pull into the traffic , ma &apos;am . let &apos;s go .
kalinda , hello .
i need a moment .
it &apos;s nothing bad .
five minutes .
i know that &apos;s where you have your gun .
you won &apos;t need it .
this is clyde . and jim .
hi .
your firm tried to drop me as a client .
this is my best month in five years .
i pay on time , i pay well ,
and yet your firm wanted to drop me .
why ?
i don &apos;t know .
i didn &apos;t even know that they had tried to drop you .
is it the subpoena ?
i don &apos;t think so .
there &apos;s nothing there .
is it about cary ?
is he in deeper trouble than i thought ?
no .
then i &apos;m confused .
you should talk to alicia .
why ?
kalinda ?
alicia &apos;s considering running for state &apos;s attorney .
i &apos;m not sure if that &apos;s why , but ...
it would make sense .
thank you for doing this , mrs. weymouth . veronica .
we just wanted to apologize for the events of last week .
you mean when she hit my son ?
yes . veronica realizes now that she was in the wrong .
yes , i was in the wrong .
i &apos;m sorry i &apos;m late . mrs. weymouth .
you &apos;re the governor &apos;s wife ?
yes . and this must be greg . hi .
i &apos;m sure my mother has expressed her deepest regrets
at her overreacting last week .
no .
i just see her smiling there .
i deeply regret my overreaction .
we &apos;re hoping this settles the matter , myra .
it does .
that and $ 50,000 .
what ?
you don &apos;t want a suit . i get it .
but greg was scarred by this .
he was not scarred . if i had wanted to scar him ...
mom . mrs. weymouth ,
we &apos;re not gonna just give you $ 50,000 .
okay . i &apos;ll see you in court .
i should &apos;ve spanked you , you bitch .
oh , you know what , let &apos;s go . just try it .
mom , is that you ?
yeah , did zach call ?
no . come here .
you have to see this .
what ?
hi , mrs. florrick .
jennifer .
what &apos;s going on ?
i &apos;m just editing grace &apos;s video .
but look .
i have a google alert on your name , and this popped up .
今天就捐款吧
it &apos;s cool , mrs. florrick .
like hillary , huh ?
oh , no . eli .
but look .
look how much they &apos;ve raised .
it just started 24 hours ago , and you already have $ 83 ...
$ 84,000 .
but i haven &apos;t decided to run yet .
you have to run . people are giving money .
it &apos;s a pac .
and we had nothing to do with it . i &apos;m serious .
alicia , it is illegal for us
to have anything to do with something like this .
and even if it weren &apos;t , we didn &apos;t do this . did you ?
no . it &apos;s a popular expression of grassroots approval .
what &apos;s wrong ?
the intern &apos;s here .
the intern is ...
alicia , i have to call you back .
you saw her here ?
no .
i have a security alert on my account
in case the governor signs her back in . right there .
when was the entrance ?
ten minutes ago .
where &apos;s the governor ?
in his office .
door closed .
damn it .
it &apos;s like a grade school around here .
what are you gonna do ?
mr. governor , i am seeing ...
hello .
eli , i &apos;d like you to meet an old friend of mine ,
ramona lytton .
i &apos;m trying to convince her not to become a lobbyist .
eli . gold .
ramona lytton . so you &apos;re lauren &apos;s ...
don &apos;t you dare butter me up by saying &quot; sister . &quot;
mother .
however ,
uh , ramona did have her at 12 .
oh , stop it .
so , is eli who i have to thank ?
yep . it was all his idea .
mmm . thank you , eli .
my idea ?
getting lauren a job in shaw &apos;s senate office .
and thank you for tolerating her here .
she was sad to leave .
yes , it was s @-@ sad .
eli .
see , that &apos;s why i didn &apos;t want to fire lauren .
her mother was going through a hard time
and she asked me to get her a job .
how do you know her ?
she &apos;s a family friend .
show a little relief , eli .
i wasn &apos;t sleeping with lauren .
hello , greg .
hello , myra .
hi .
where are we on the money ?
here we are .
what &apos;s this ?
surveillance video .
these are the store &apos;s cameras .
there . see ?
i don &apos;t know what you thought this would prove .
this is your mom spanking my son .
yes , it is . and this is three minutes earlier .
so ?
and this ...
is three minutes before that .
now , this woman is an 86 @-@ year @-@ old widow named mrs. skreeker ,
and she &apos;d like to know
who &apos;s responsible for several thousand dollars in hospital bills .
your move , myra .
i think it would be best if you accepted our apology , ma &apos;am .
it &apos;ll make life easier .
let &apos;s go . let &apos;s go .
where are you ?
in my room . at school .
mom , i &apos;m so sorry . dad told me .
told you what ?
that you &apos;re upset about the nisa thing .
what &apos;s the nisa thing ?
i wanted to tell you . mom , i really did .
i just ... didn &apos;t want to get nisa in trouble .
were nisa &apos;s parents there ?
where ?
at the abortion clinic .
yes . but @-@ but , mom , i didn &apos;t know that .
and i @-@ i didn &apos;t know what nisa wanted .
it all happened so fast .
i said you could go to check out boston college .
i saw you leave with your duffel bag .
i know , mom . i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m so sorry .
have you smoked pot , zach ?
what ?
when you said that you hadn &apos;t smoked pot ,
were you lying ?
m @-@ mom , here &apos;s the thing ...
no , zach . don &apos;t embarrass yourself by saying any more .
i &apos;m running for state &apos;s attorney .
my parenting skills will be called into question .
i need you to say that i am a good parent ,
that i knew about your abortion .
we talked about it . i gave you all the options .
i counseled you to have the baby .
i would help take care of it . you decided against that .
that was your right . do you understand ?
why are you running for state &apos;s attorney ?
have fun in college , zach .
mr. elfman .
yes , i have to show you something .
i &apos;m running .
good .
&apos;cause there &apos;s an article coming out about you going into detox
for your alcohol addiction .
what ?
and ...
there &apos;s a photo .
mrs. florrick .
mr. bishop , hi . is everything all right ?
it is . i decided to take your advice and hire another firm .
good . i think that &apos;s for the best .
i &apos;m also saying that you fired me as a client .
and i &apos;m very upset .
i ... y @-@ you don &apos;t need to do that , mr. bishop .
i know .
but it &apos;s good for you .
oh . here .
we can &apos;t coordinate ,
but you can get to me through my associate .
get to you , um , about what ?
your pac . i mean ,
the pac that i set up in support of you .
$ 140,000 and counting .
that &apos;s ...
yes .
the least i could do .
there &apos;s more money where that came from .
