there is a town in maine ...
i &apos;d like a room .
welcome to storybrooke .
where every storybook character you &apos;ve ever known ...
is trapped between two worlds ...
an evil queen sent a bunch of fairy tale characters here .
and now they don &apos;t remember who they are .
victims of a powerful curse ...
everything you love , everything all of you love ,
will be taken from you .
that can only be broken by one person .
it &apos;s your destiny .
you &apos;re gonna bring back the happy endings .
you enjoy your stay .
the missing pages where are they ?
it &apos;s an old book . stuff &apos;s missing .
what do you care ?
i care because you think i &apos;m some evil queen .
and that hurts me , henry .
i &apos;m your mother .
no , you &apos;re not .
well , then , who is ?
that woman you brought here ?
i don &apos;t like what she or this book is doing to you .
thankfully both are no longer an issue .
what ?
hey , how about that ?
guess those rusty old innards
finally straightened themselves out , huh ?
yes , how about that , indeed .
did you know the honey crisp tree
is the most vigorous and hardy of all apple trees ?
it can survive temperatures as low as 40 below and keep growing .
it can weather any storm .
i have one that i &apos;ve tended to since i was a little girl ...
and to this day i have yet to taste anything
more delicious than the fruit it offers .
thanks .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll enjoy them on your drive home .
actually , i &apos;m gonna stay for a while .
i &apos;m not sure that &apos;s such a good idea .
henry has enough issues .
he doesn &apos;t need you confusing him .
all due respect , madame mayor ,
the fact that you have now threatened me twice in the last 12 hours
makes me want to stay more .
since when were apples a threat ?
i can read between the lines .
sorry . i just want to make sure henry &apos;s okay .
he &apos;s fine , dear .
any problems he has are being taken care of .
what does that mean ?
it means i have him in therapy .
it &apos;s all under control .
take my advice , ms. swan ,
only one of us knows what &apos;s best for henry .
yeah , i &apos;m starting to think you &apos;re right about that .
it &apos;s time for you to go .
or what ?
don &apos;t underestimate me , ms. swan .
you have no idea what i &apos;m capable of .
i shall destroy your happiness ...
if it is the last thing i do .
would you like something to drink ?
do i look like i need a drink ?
i was only trying to help .
thank you .
now that was an awfully big threat .
destroy everyone &apos;s happiness ?
how do you plan on accomplishing that ?
the dark curse .
are you sure , your majesty ?
you said you &apos;d never use it .
you made a deal when you gave away that curse .
you traded it away .
she won &apos;t be happy to see you .
since when do i care about anyone else &apos;s happiness but mine ?
prepare the carriage .
we &apos;re going to the forbidden fortress .
how are you , dear ?
i &apos;m doing fine .
are you ?
if it were me ,
i &apos;d be simply tortured ,
watching that flake of snow so happy .
weren &apos;t you about the same age when you were to be married
before she ruined it all ? yes , you were .
yes , it was about the same age you were
when that sleeping beauty got the best of you ,
my dear maleficent .
i soldiered on , as you will , too , hopefully .
enough games . you know why i &apos;m here .
i need my curse back .
it &apos;s not yours anymore .
a deal &apos;s a deal .
i traded you my sleeping curse .
which failed , undone by a simple kiss .
now please , return what &apos;s mine .
the dark curse ? really ?
you must know that not even its unholy power
can bring your loved one back from the dead .
have you considered a pet ?
they can be quite comforting .
the only comfort for me is snow white &apos;s suffering .
well , it &apos;s her wedding night .
i doubt she &apos;s suffering right now .
i need that curse .
i know you keep it hidden in the orb above your staff .
hidden for the good of all , old friend .
whoever created that monstrosity
makes the two of us look positively ... moral .
who did give it to you ?
where i got it &apos;s none of your concern .
hand it back .
must we do this ?
alas , we must .
no !
love is weakness , maleficent .
i thought you knew that .
if you &apos;re going to kill me , kill me .
why would i do that ?
you &apos;re my only friend .
don &apos;t do this .
this curse-- there are lines even we shouldn &apos;t cross .
all power comes with a price .
enacting it will take a terrible toll .
it will leave an emptiness inside you ...
a void you will never be able to fill .
so be it .
who among us is tired of losing ?
that &apos;s why i called you here ...
to put an end to our misery .
today we claim victory ...
and move to a new , better realm ...
a place where we can finally win .
and we &apos;ll be happy ?
i guarantee it .
but first ,
i need something from you--
a lock of hair from those with the darkest souls .
you must trust me ,
because if you don &apos;t , there are other ways .
a wise decision .
all that remains is the final ingredient ...
a prized heart ...
from my childhood steed ...
the glorious beast whose passing will fuel our victory .
let my wrath be unleashed .
yeah , you really unleashed something there .
the &quot; mirror &quot; strikes again .
you &apos;re late .
sorry . i wanted to bring you the latest edition .
i assure you it &apos;s one of my better hatched jobs .
that &apos;s not what i asked for .
what &apos;d you find out about her ?
well , the truth be told , there wasn &apos;t much .
she spent a lot of time in foster homes .
uh , she got into some trouble when she was a kid ,
but the details are locked up pretty tight .
since then , she &apos;s clean . bounced around all over .
the only thing i really learned
was that she doesn &apos;t like to sit still .
that appears to have changed .
did you know that , um ,
she had henry while she was in phoenix ?
how &apos;d he wind up here in maine ?
so if i &apos;m understanding you correctly ...
you found nothing of value ,
which means you have no value , sidney .
do you know what i do with things that hold no value to me ?
i throw them away .
i &apos;ll keep looking .
here you go .
thank you ,
but i did not order that .
yeah , i know . you have an admirer .
ah , so you decided to stay .
observant-- important for a cop .
it &apos;s good news for our tourist business .
it &apos;s bad for our local signage .
it &apos;s--it &apos;s a joke .
because you ran over our sign .
look , the cocoa was a nice gesture ,
and i am impressed that you guessed
that i like cinnamon on my chocolate , &apos; cause most people don &apos;t ,
but i am not here to flirt ,
so thank you , but no , thank you .
i didn &apos;t send it .
i did .
i like cinnamon , too .
don &apos;t you have school ?
duh . i &apos;m 10 .
walk me .
so what &apos;s the deal with you and your mom ?
it &apos;s not about us . it &apos;s about her curse .
we have to break it . luckily , i have a plan .
step one--identification . i call it operation cobra .
cobra ? that has nothing to do with fairy tales .
exactly . it &apos;s a code name
to throw the queen off the trail .
so everyone here is a fairy tale character--
they just don &apos;t know it ?
that &apos;s the curse .
time &apos;s been frozen , until you got here .
where &apos;d you get that ?
your mom ?
don &apos;t eat that .
okay .
uh , all right , what about their pasts ?
they don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s a haze to them .
ask anyone anything , and you &apos;ll see .
so for decades ,
people have been walking around in a haze ,
not aging , with screwed @-@ up memories ,
stuck in a cursed town that kept them oblivious .
i knew you &apos;d get it .
that &apos;s why we need you .
you &apos;re the only one who can stop her curse .
because i &apos;m the daughter of snow white and prince charming .
yes , and right now we have the advantage .
my mom doesn &apos;t know that .
i took out the end , the part with you in it .
see ? your mom is snow white .
oh , kid .
i know the hero never believes at first .
if they did , it wouldn &apos;t be a very good story .
if you need proof , take them , read them ,
but whatever you do ,
don &apos;t let her see these pages . they &apos;re dangerous .
if she finds out who you are ...
it would be bad .
i gotta go ,
but i &apos;ll find you later and we can get started .
i knew you &apos;d believe me !
i never said i did .
why else would you be here ?
it &apos;s good to see his smile back .
i didn &apos;t do anything .
you stayed .
so does the mayor know you &apos;re still here ?
oh , she knows .
what is her deal ?
she is not a great people person .
how did she get elected ?
she &apos;s been mayor as long as i can remember .
no one &apos;s ever been brave enough to run against her .
she inspires quite a bit of ...
well , fear .
i &apos;m afraid i only made that worse by giving henry that book .
now he thinks she &apos;s the evil queen .
who does he think you are ?
oh . it &apos;s silly .
i just got five minutes of silly . lay it on me .
snow white .
who does he think you are ?
i &apos;m not in the book .
can i ask you a favor ?
regina mentioned the kid &apos;s in therapy .
do you know where i can find the doctor ?
emma swan . i was , uh , just reading about you .
let me guess--
you &apos;re here for help with a little post @-@ traumatic stress ?
that diagnosis was free , by the way .
no , i &apos;m here about henry .
i &apos;m sorry . i @-@ i @-@ i really shouldn &apos;t ...
i know . i &apos;m sorry .
just tell me something .
this fairy tale obsession-- what is causing it ?
i mean , he thinks everyone is a character in his book .
that &apos;s ...
crazy .
i hope you don &apos;t talk that way in front of him .
the word &quot; crazy &quot; is , um , quite damaging . these stories ...
they &apos;re his language .
he has no idea how to express complex emotions ,
so he &apos;s translating as best he can .
this is how he communicates ,
and he &apos;s using this book to help deal with this problems .
but he got the book a month ago .
has he been seeing you longer than that ?
um ... yes , he has .
so it &apos;s regina , isn &apos;t it ?
uh , his mother is a ... very complicated woman ,
and , uh , over the years ,
her attempts to try and bring henry closer have only backfired .
why don &apos;t you take a look at the file ?
um , see what i mean .
why are you doing this ?
well , he talks about you a lot ,
and you &apos;re very important to him .
thank you .
just , uh , see that i get it back , okay ?
ms. swan .
for the sake of the boy ,
be careful how you handle his belief system .
destroying his imagination would be--be devastating .
you were right . she was just here .
did she take the file ?
yes .
how--how did you know she was gonna come here ?
because i &apos;m the one who gave her the idea .
hey there .
if you &apos;re concerned about the &quot; do not disturb &quot; signs ,
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;ve left them alone .
actually , i &apos;m here about
dr. archibald hopper .
he mentioned you got into a bit of a row with him earlier ?
no .
i was shocked , too ,
given your shy , delicate sensibilities .
he says you demanded to see henry &apos;s files
and when he refused , you came back and stole them .
he gave them to me .
alas , he &apos;s telling a different tale .
may i check your room ,
or must i get a search warrant ?
is this what you &apos;re looking for ?
well , you &apos;re very accommodating .
i &apos;m afraid , ms. swan , you &apos;re under arrest ... again .
you know i &apos;m being set up , don &apos;t you ?
and who , may i ask , is setting you up ?
... where carbon dioxide and water synthesize .
may i speak with my son ?
we &apos;re in the middle of a lesson . is it important ?
do you think i &apos;d be here if it wasn &apos;t ?
henry , sweetie , i have some bad news .
the woman who you brought here--
she &apos;s been arrested .
she broke into dr. hopper &apos;s office
and stole his files .
she &apos;s a con woman .
she &apos;s trying to learn about us in order to take advantage of us .
that &apos;s why she &apos;s sticking around .
i &apos;m sorry .
no , you &apos;re not .
i know you think otherwise ,
but all i &apos;m doing is trying to protect you .
this is gonna be good for us . you &apos;ll see .
things will be better .
i gotta get back to class .
you know the shrink is lying , right ?
to the right , please . why would he lie ?
the mayor put him up to this .
she &apos;s gotta have something on him .
he &apos;s terrified of her like everyone else in this ...
town .
to the left .
regina may be ...
a touch intimidating ,
but i don &apos;t think she &apos;d go as far as a frame job .
how far would she go ? what does she have her hands in ?
well , she &apos;s the mayor . she has her hands in everything .
including the police force ?
henry . henry , what are you doing here ?
his mother told him what happened .
of course she did .
henry , i don &apos;t know what she said--
you &apos;re a genius .
what ?
i know what you were up to .
you were gathering intel ...
for operation cobra ?
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m a bit lost .
it &apos;s need @-@ to @-@ know , sheriff ,
and all you need to know
is that ms. blanchard &apos;s gonna bail her out .
you are ?
why ?
i , uh , trust you .
well , if you can uncuff me , i have something to do .
what the hell are you doing ?
picking apples .
you &apos;re out of your mind .
no , you are , if you think a shoddy frame job &apos;s
enough to scare me off .
you &apos;re gonna have to do better than that .
you come after me one more time ,
i &apos;m coming back for the rest of this tree .
because , sister , you have no idea what i &apos;m capable of .
your move .
maybe it &apos;s for the best .
the forces you &apos;re summoning are darker than we can conceive .
oh , now you &apos;re trying to protect me ?
it &apos;s what i do .
i know .
you &apos;re the only one who does .
helping you is my life .
well , then help me understand why this curse isn &apos;t working .
if you want to know that ,
then you need to go back to the person
who gave it to you in the first place .
revenge is a dark and lonely road . once you go down it ...
there is no heading back .
what is there for me to head back to ?
it &apos;s just us , dearie .
you can show yourself .
that curse you gave me ...
it &apos;s not working .
oh , so worried .
so , so worried ...
like snow and her lovely new husband .
what ?
they paid me a visit as well .
they were very anxious
about you and the curse .
what &apos;d you tell them ?
the truth--that nothing can stop the darkness ...
except , of course , their unborn child .
you see ,
no matter how powerful ,
all curses can be broken .
their child is the key .
of course the curse has to be enacted first .
tell me what i did wrong .
for that , there &apos;s a price .
what do you want ?
simple .
in this new land ,
i want comfort .
i want a good life .
fine . you &apos;ll have an estate , be rich .
i wasn &apos;t finished . there &apos;s more .
there always is with you .
yeah .
in this new land ,
should i ever come to you for any reason ,
you must heed my every request .
you must do whatever i say ,
so long as i say ...
please .
you do realize that should i succeed ,
you won &apos;t remember any of this ?
oh , well , then ... what &apos;s the harm ?
deal .
what must i do to enact this curse ?
you need to sacrifice a heart .
i sacrificed my prized steed .
a horse ? this is the curse to end all curses .
you think a horse is gonna do ?
great power requires great sacrifice .
the heart you need
must come from something far more precious .
tell me what will suffice .
the heart of the thing you love most .
what i love most died because of snow white .
is there no one else you truly love ?
this curse isn &apos;t going to be easy .
vengeance never is , dearie .
you have to ask yourself a simple question--
how far are you willing to go ?
as far as it takes .
then please stop wasting everyone &apos;s time and just do it .
you know what you love .
now go kill it .
ms. swan .
oh , my , this is terribly awkward .
i need to ask you to leave .
i &apos;m afraid we have a no @-@ felons rule .
it turns out it &apos;s a city ordinance .
let me guess--the mayor &apos;s office just called to remind you ?
you can gather your things ,
but i need to have your room key back .
she destroyed city property .
i want her arrested .
again ?
what are you waiting for ?
i &apos;m just not convinced arresting her &apos;s the right plan ...
and i &apos;m not talking about your tree .
we both know she didn &apos;t steal those files .
oh , do we ?
i mean , she looked pretty shocked
when i leveled the charges against her .
guess she doesn &apos;t like being caught .
or because she was set up .
and if she was , that means dr. hopper was lying .
and if he &apos;s lying , that means that someone asked him to .
are we really confident
that the man &apos;s conscience won &apos;t eventually get the best of him ?
i think your schoolboy crush is clouding your judgment .
remember , i made you sheriff ,
and i can take it away just as easily .
you want me to arrest her again , i will .
good .
but she &apos;s gonna keep coming at you ,
and i know you-- you &apos;re gonna keep coming at her
and you will do whatever it takes to get her out of here
and you may succeed .
no , i will succeed .
he &apos;s my son . it &apos;s what &apos;s best for him .
i know that &apos;s what you believe .
okay ? but if this escalates ,
it seems to me the only one who will get hurt is henry .
yeah ?
ms. swan , i &apos;d be happy to continue demonstrating my power ,
but am i right in guessing your resolve to stay is only growing ?
you have no idea .
well , then , i think it &apos;s time we made peace .
why don &apos;t you drive over to my office ?
or walk--whatever suits you .
i &apos;d like to start by apologizing ,
ms. swan .
what ?
i just have to accept the reality
that you want to be here ...
that &apos;s right , i do .
and that you &apos;re here to take my son from me .
okay . let &apos;s be clear .
i have no intention of taking him from anyone .
well , then , what are you doing here ?
i know i &apos;m not a mother--i think that &apos;s pretty self @-@ evident--
but i did have him , and i can &apos;t help it--
he got in my head and i want to make sure he &apos;s okay .
the more you try to push me out , the more i want to be here ,
especially after seeing how troubled he is .
you think he &apos;s troubled ?
well , he &apos;s in therapy ,
and i only got through a couple pages of his shrink &apos;s notes
before you had me arrested , but putting all that aside--
he thinks everyone in this town is a fairy tale character .
and you don &apos;t ?
how can i ?
the poor kid can &apos;t tell the difference
between fantasy and reality , and it &apos;s only getting worse .
it &apos;s crazy .
you think i &apos;m crazy ?
henry .
how long was he there ?
long enough .
you knew he would be here .
did i know that my son comes to my office
every thursday at precisely 5 : 00 p.m.
so i can take him for dinner before his therapy session ?
of course i did .
i &apos;m his mother .
your move .
you have no soul .
how in the hell did you get like this ?
what happened ? did you get your answer ?
what &apos;s going on ?
your majesty ?
your majesty !
did rumplestiltskin tell you what you needed to know ?
yes .
and ?
i &apos;m not sure i should say .
i &apos;m conflicted .
how bad is it ?
maybe i can help .
i have to cut out the heart of the thing i love most .
me .
daddy , i don &apos;t know what to do .
my dear ...
please ...
you don &apos;t have to do this .
i have to do something .
then move past this .
i know this may sound self @-@ serving ,
but you don &apos;t need to enact the curse .
but i can &apos;t keep living like this .
what snow did to me ,
what she took from me ...
it &apos;s eating me alive , daddy .
her very existence mocks me .
she must be punished .
what &apos;s ...
if the price is a hole that will never be filled ,
why do it ?
stop worrying about snow white and start over .
we can have a new life .
but what kind of life ?
all i &apos;ve worked for , all i &apos;ve built , will be gone .
my power will disappear . they already think i &apos;m nothing .
power is seductive , but so is love ,
and you can have that again .
i just want to be happy .
you can be . of this i &apos;m sure .
i believe , given the chance ,
we can find happiness together .
but the choice is yours .
i think you &apos;re right .
i can be happy .
just not here .
i &apos;m sorry .
just wanted to say thank you and , um ,
pay you back the bail money .
you look like you need to talk .
cinnamon ?
oh . i &apos;m sorry . i should have asked .
it &apos;s a little quirk of mine . do you mind ?
not at all .
no , thanks .
when you bailed me out , you said that you trusted me .
why ?
it &apos;s strange , ever since you arrived here ,
i &apos;ve had the oddest feeling like we met before .
i mean , i know it &apos;s crazy .
i &apos;m starting to reevaluate my definition of crazy .
for what it &apos;s worth , i think you &apos;re innocent .
of breaking and entering or just in general ?
whichever makes you feel better .
doesn &apos;t really matter
what anyone thinks i did or didn &apos;t do .
i &apos;m leaving .
thank you for everything , but i think it &apos;s for the best .
if i stay , henry &apos;s only gonna keep getting hurt .
what happens if you go ?
i think the very fact that you want to leave
is why you have to stay .
you care about him .
who will protect henry if you won &apos;t ?
are you sure you don &apos;t want to talk about it ?
you know , that umbrella is kind of my good luck charm .
is that why you think i &apos;m jiminy cricket ?
i don &apos;t think you &apos;re anyone .
ms. swan .
look , i can explain . the mayor forced me--
i know .
don &apos;t worry about it . i get it .
henry , i &apos;m sorry .
i don &apos;t want to talk to you .
ms. swan , if she knew you were here--
to hell with her .
henry , there is one simple reason i stayed here--you .
i wanted to get to know you .
you think i &apos;m crazy .
no , i think the curse is crazy , and it is .
but that doesn &apos;t mean that it isn &apos;t true .
it is a lot to ask anyone to believe in ,
but there are a lot of crazy things in this world .
so what do i know ? maybe it is true .
but you told my mom--
what she needed to hear .
what i do know ...
is that if the curse is real , the only way to break it
is by tricking the evil queen ...
into thinking that we are nonbelievers ,
&apos;cause that way , she &apos;s not on to us .
isn &apos;t that what operation cobra was all about ?
throwing her off the trail ?
brilliant .
i read the pages ,
and , henry , you &apos;re right-- they are dangerous .
there is only one way to make sure that she never sees these .
now we have the advantage .
i knew you were here to help me .
that &apos;s right , kid . i am .
and nothing , not even a curse ,
is gonna stop that .
i love you , daddy .
what a mess .
not for long .
what can i do for you , mr. gold ?
i was just in the neighborhood , thought i &apos;d pop by .
lovely to see you in such high spirits .
well , it &apos;s been a good day .
i just rid the town of an unwanted nuisance .
emma swan ? really ?
yes . i imagine she &apos;s halfway to boston by now .
i wouldn &apos;t bet on that .
i &apos;ve just seen her strolling
down the main street with your boy .
thick as thieves , they looked .
what ?
perhaps you should have come to me .
if ms. swan is a problem you can &apos;t fix ,
i &apos;m only too happy to help , for a price , of course .
i &apos;m not in the business of making deals with you anymore .
to which deal are you referring ?
you know what deal .
oh , right , yeah .
the boy i procured for you .
henry .
did i ever tell you what a lovely name that was ?
however did you pick it ?
did you want her to come to town ?
you wanted all this to happen , didn &apos;t you ?
your finding henry wasn &apos;t an accident , was it ?
whatever do you mean ?
where did you get him ?
do you know something ?
i &apos;ve no idea what you &apos;re implying .
i think you do .
who is this woman , his mother , this ... emma swan ?
i would say you think you know exactly who she is .
i really must be going .
tell me what you know about her .
i &apos;m not gonna answer you , dear ,
so i suggest you excuse me .
please .
