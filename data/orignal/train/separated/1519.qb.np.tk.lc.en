okay , lily , ballet at 11 : 00,
then a playdate , then karate class at 3 : 00,
so why don &apos;t you go get your uniform ?
chop chop !
cam .
what ?
she &apos;s in karate . it &apos;s not offensive .
debatable , but why would you
schedule all this extra stuff
on the same day as her talent show ?
okay , are you accusing me of overscheduling
our tone @-@ deaf daughter so she &apos;s so tired
she misses the talent show and doesn &apos;t humiliate herself ?
lily has no talent .
because she &apos;s 7 . no one has talent at 7 .
i did . tons of it .
sheep @-@ shearing , cornhusking , hay @-@ baling .
it was hard for me to pick just one to showcase
at my first little prince pageant .
in the end , i went with waltzing .
you waltzed at 7 ?
barely . my partner had two left hooves .
i got it !
hey , wait . isn &apos;t my talent show today ?
oh , who knows ? but let &apos;s go ride some ponies .
no , no , you &apos;re right . it is today ,
and since you have a little bit of time before ballet ...
why don &apos;t you two do a little bit of warming up ?
maestro ? come on .
oh , okay , great . thank you .
yeah , yeah .
so , lily , can you meet me here at ... * c *
* now daddy &apos;s lonely *
* i &apos;m there with you *
* no , you &apos;re not , you &apos;re not even close *
* this can &apos;t possibly sound the same to you *
* maybe i can help , daddy is also here at ... *
* no , that &apos;s not even a note *
* i feel like you &apos;re doing it on purpose *
* that seems a little bit sharp *
* i &apos;m never sharp , i &apos;m pitch @-@ perfect *
* i &apos;m talking about your tone toward our daughter *
* i can understand you even when you &apos;re singing *
what are you doing ?
i am gathering every binky that is in this house ,
because from today on , joe is going cold turkey .
okay , joe , have your last puff if you want .
gloria , i &apos;m trying to watch something here .
okay , you can keep crying all you want .
i can &apos;t hear anything . try growing up in colombia .
my binky was a spark plug .
luke , how could you forget your bathing suit ?
you came over here to swim .
it &apos;s all right , honey . he can wear mine .
i &apos;ll borrow from jay .
you have a favorite i should keep my hands off of , jay ?
that ship sailed about 20 years ago .
zinger !
save some of that charm
for our commercial shoot today , dad , huh ?
you see what our competition &apos;s doing ?
see the lasers ? special effects ?
i &apos;ll bet they spent 5 million bucks on that thing .
don &apos;t worry , dad .
the concept i came up with is so much better than theirs .
we &apos;re scrapping it .
what ? i worked for two months on that .
sorry . we gotta go with what &apos;s proven .
we &apos;re remaking my old commercial .
30 years ago , my dad was in a local ad
for pritchett &apos;s closets ,
and he has always been
really proud of the slogan he came up with .
i &apos;ve never understood what it means .
pritchett &apos;s closets --
choose one of our nine luxurious models
like the monte carlo .
or how about a custom design
using our state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art technology ?
come visit pritchett &apos;s
and go home with the closet of your dreams .
closet ? you &apos;ll love it !
the entire town went nuts for that ad .
people stopped me in the street ,
asking me to say the slogan .
are you sure they weren &apos;t asking you to explain it ?
what &apos;s to explain ?
instead of &quot; like it ? you &apos;ll love it , &quot;
you use the word &quot; closet . &quot;
then why not , &quot; like it ? you &apos;ll closet ! &quot; ?
that makes no sense .
look , i know it was rough on you and mitch
having a famous dad ,
you know , getting your picture taken in restaurants .
that happened one time , dad . only because you were
with ralph berman , &quot; garage door opener king . &quot;
hey , he was eating with us .
the point is ,
that ad scored for us , and it will again .
so we &apos;re gonna flush all my hard work
because you got freaked out by some commercial
that &apos;s not even that catchy .
* closets , closets *
all right , get there !
hey , if you really wanna impress beth when she gets here ,
you should try for that giant elephant .
oh , penguin &apos;s just as good .
money !
i just spent a lot of money . a lot .
sorry . i had to check in at the job .
always something going down at the hut .
you work at the hut ?
i would guess pizza ,
but based on your ripply stomach i saw
when you helped me get down off the gondola ride ,
i &apos;m gonna guess ... sunglass hut .
yep , chase picked out these vintage @-@ y sunglasses
that look like i could &apos;ve been murdered
at a cool house party in the &apos; 70s .
ooh , you &apos;ve been framed .
you should use that .
at your job at the hut .
you just said &quot; jabba the hut . &quot;
i &apos;m really lost here , guys .
that smarts .
again ?
yeah . uh , it &apos;s probably just motion sickness .
uh , yeah , the motion of shoving deep fried garbage
in your mouth all day .
it &apos;s my manager again . she &apos;s always on me .
can &apos;t wait till the fall when she &apos;s off to college .
yeah , maureen ?
beth &apos;s not coming .
she &apos;s too tired to drive up from san diego .
so this beth , who i &apos;ve never actually met ,
is she one of those real @-@ life move @-@ around girls ?
no , she is a real girl .
fine , but , you know , she flew all the way over here
for some coast guard training .
she can &apos;t drive a couple hours to see you ?
she &apos;s been saving drowning mannequins all morning ,
and some of them are plus @-@ sized ,
because a lot of people fall off cruise ships .
okay , but doesn &apos;t it bother you
that she &apos;s flaked for , like , the hundredth time ?
i know you have a problem with beth ,
but what we have works for me , okay ?
and if we &apos;re pointing fingers ...
i want you to help me find my keys .
wait . shh .
they &apos;re in my jacket .
okay .
got it .
mom , that perv is ogling you again .
no ! i was reading my horoscope .
&quot; you will borrow a huge swimsuit today . &quot; what ?
ay , no , the plane !
the plane ! it &apos;s always spying on me !
go away or i &apos;m gonna call the policeman !
wow , don &apos;t even waste your time , gloria .
johnny law &apos;s got no chance with that baby .
you &apos;re looking at a freeling cloudgazer
with after @-@ market frequency scrambler . untraceable .
as you can guess , i &apos;m a droner myself .
yes , you &apos;re droning right now .
ay , it &apos;s getting closer !
mom , maybe you should cover up .
no ! that &apos;s crazy .
we can just knock it out of the sky .
manny , grab the hose .
i &apos;ll use this to blind it .
my eyes !
my eyes !
and just like that , it disappears .
in his defense , the water &apos;s really cold .
you &apos;re still rehearsing .
we sure are , and we found a more appropriate song
for lily &apos;s singing voice .
really ? well , i &apos;d love to hear it .
okay .
* everybody was kung fu fighting * * we are *
* those kicks were fast as lightning * * we are *
* in fact , it was a little bit frightening * * we are *
okay , stop , stop , stop .
no , come on . no . no !
this is ridiculous . she &apos;s not even singing .
she wasn &apos;t singing before either .
okay , go get some water .
cam .
mitchell , i just don &apos;t want her to embarrass herself
in front of her friends , not to mention the parents .
i can already hear andrew &apos;s condescending , &quot; hmm . &quot;
oh , my gosh . you &apos;re still competing with andrew .
he staged a coup , mitchell .
he forced me out of the group i founded.i founded it .
the greensleevers were southern california &apos;s
premier holiday chorus
and &quot; just the nutmeg we want
our yuletide eggnog dusted with &quot;
&quot; l.a. times , &quot; december 23 , 199 ...
i remember .
oh , i remember . i remember .
so you &apos;re not worried about lily embarrassing herself .
you &apos;re worried about lily embarrassing you .
not so much now that she &apos;s not singing .
lily is gonna sing whatever she wants ,
and you &apos;re gonna get over this thing with andrew ...
because a grown man should not have a nemesis .
it &apos;s ridiculous .
you know what &apos;s ridiculous ?
is being forced to turn in your jingle bells
to a man with less vocal range than a teakettle .
oh , i thought you had a date .
i did , but i bailed . he &apos;s not exactly the sharpest shed .
what is his deal ?
i took his pacifier hours ago ,
and he &apos;s still crying . he &apos;s being such a baby .
well , maybe he &apos;s just not ready to give them up .
no , i promised my mother that he wouldn &apos;t use it anymore .
her uncle used it until he was 4,
and now he &apos;s in jail .
i feel like a lot of your family stories end that way .
i &apos;m gonna put on a bathing suit .
hi , manny .
please stick joe in front of the tv .
he always calms down when he listens to ...
closets , closets , closets , closets .
dad , you might wanna see this .
he put us on youtube ?
he called it &quot; drone 1 , idiots zero . &quot;
it has 32,000 views .
we have to strike back .
that drone just messed with the wrong idiot .
andy &apos;s in the hospital .
what ? why ?
appendicitis .
is he okay ? maybe i should go down there .
this is not good .
my second cousin got appendicitis ,
and now he &apos;s in jail .
closet ? you &apos;ll love it .
and ... cut .
uh , that was great , jay .
let &apos;s try it again . maybe a little lighter .
lighter .
yeah . just , you know , happier , warmer .
even more ?
all right .
from jay &apos;s line . here we go . and ...
action .
closet ? you &apos;ll love it !
cut .
you see that was exactly the same , right ?
i do .
so what does it mean ?
i don &apos;t know .
so do we have it ?
i gave you , like , 10 different choices .
let &apos;s not overthink this , huh ? just pick one .
okay . well ... give him a minute .
he &apos;ll calm down .
sure .
uh , hey , claire ?
yes . yeah .
so we were just talking ,
and strictly from a marketing standpoint ,
do you think jay is , um ...
he stinks .
he &apos;s the worst . so bad .
and , um ... strictly from a keeping @-@ my @-@ job standpoint ,
it would be so dope if you told him that .
oh , god . i can &apos;t fire my dad !
i know . i know . it must be hard ,
but you realize it &apos;s the best thing for the company .
yes , i do .
okay .
can i at least count on you to back me up ?
totally . come on . we both know your dad is incredible .
do you see him today ? he &apos;s like george clooney
but older , but better .
i ... thought that was jay . i &apos;m sorry .
oh , man . almost fainted .
just gonna put my head between my legs .
plenty of room down there .
we &apos;ll now take a break to sweep up the confetti
that was definitely not mentioned in dress rehearsal .
okay , here comes andrew .
just act like we don &apos;t care
about the whole greensleevers thing .
ooh , i hope i could pull this off .
cameron .
andrew .
enjoyable show .
so did you ...
direct ? no , not this year .
ah , i didn &apos;t think so .
you &apos;re ...
so we &apos;re really enjoying the show , too .
it &apos;s all about the kids , you know .
sorry . they only had flat .
mitchell .
simon .
turns out recently , andrew married simon .
my bitter rival from law school .
or ... nemesis ?
i &apos;ve ...
so how &apos;s work ?
i &apos;m sure you heard i made partner
at gotshal , manges , flom , arps &amp; leboeuf .
and i &apos;m actually at the justice institute now .
so rewarding .
oh , i think our firm donated
one of our old fax machines to you guys .
we better go . we &apos;re moving closer
because our daughter &apos;s about to perform .
yours is from vietnam , right ?
we were able to adopt one from korea .
so ...
did he really just end a conversation on &quot; so ... &quot; ?
let &apos;s just take our seats .
no , cam , i @-@ i don &apos;t know if this is
the most supportive environment for lily to --
i agree . let &apos;s get her out of the show .
okay . yeah .
and are koreans really better ?
i don &apos;t know .
chicken &apos;s in the pot .
i repeat , we have eyes on the chicken .
eat paint . damn it . i missed .
luke , gravity !
shut up , nerd !
plan &quot; b &quot; ! if you can &apos;t beat &apos; em , drone &apos; em !

i &apos;m wearing a monokini !
hey , lizzie !
okay , i need to borrow this , okay ?
here , just -- all right . okay .
i promise to bring it back , all right ?
no , that &apos;s what you said about my mom &apos;s humidifier !
he &apos;s heading for the river to try and lose us .

for stalling my auqabike !

yeah .
oh , great . another comment .
&quot; lol . that &apos;s my realtor , phil d-- &quot;
okay , let &apos;s just grab her and go .
she &apos;s up after the next act .
hey , we &apos;re doing the right thing .
you can develop deep emotional scars at age 7 .
i still can &apos;t eat--
salt and vinegar chips . yes , i know .
i can &apos;t relive this with you right now .
i &apos;m sorry . okay .
look at her .
yeah . add mouth @-@ catching to things she can &apos;t do .
no . i mean , she &apos;s not nervous at all ,
and look at the other kids . they &apos;re a wreck .
you know , she may not have gotten our talent ,
but she didn &apos;t get our self @-@ consciousness either .
well , we &apos;re not giving her our self @-@ consciousness .
today is her day , and she is--
she is gonna sing . come on .
hi , my mom &apos;s doing chemo ,
so i shaved my head to be like her .
this is for you , mom .
* and i *
* i *
* will always love you *
hey , hey , we got a problem .
what &apos;s wrong , sweetie ?
i can &apos;t go after her .
are you kidding ?
okay , well , honey , we can &apos;t just leave right now .
sorry , gotta run . maya &apos;s feeling a bit feverish .
oh , well , i guess some people can &apos;t take the heat .
* will always love you *
can you believe that ?
no .
okay , now we can leave . let &apos;s go out the side door .
hey , dad , i--
i tried to grab you after the shoot ,
but you just flew out of there .
i didn &apos;t want it to seem like
i was hanging around for compliments .
there , there was some discussion after you left .
keep it moving , buddy !
a @-@ a few people feel that you came across a little--
sign says &quot; no menus &quot; !
what &apos;d you say ?
the group thinks
that maybe it would be for the best
if , if someone else was our spokesman .
it &apos;s called pritchett &apos;s closets .
yeah , i know , but you were coming off
just a tiny bit
damn kids .
it &apos;s mine now !
tiny bit grumpy .
grumpy ?
there &apos;s nothing wrong with being a little gruff .
that &apos;s how you are .
but when it comes to selling , dad--
what do you mean ?
what do you mean , how i am ?
is that what people think of me , that i &apos;m some big grump ?
dad , that cannot be a big shock
that kids call you &quot; grumpa . &quot;
since when ?
not to your face ?
cowards .
so if i get &quot; grumpa , &quot;
what do they call phil &apos;s dad ?
you know , just &quot; funpa . &quot;
that mound of human silly string gets &quot; funpa &quot; ?
that &apos;s not the issue , dad .
no , no , i know what the issue is .
you &apos;re saying i &apos;m not warm and cuddly enough
to sell closets anymore .
it &apos;s a day that every father knows may come
but hopes it never will .
are we sure every father--
stop hurting me !
hey , how you feeling ?
oh , looks like they got you
on a bunch of good drugs before your surgery .
i just came in to check on you .
pretty scary going through this all by yourself .
too bad your girlfriend couldn &apos;t be here .
beth is real .
i know that .
no .
beth is real .
okay , you really wanna talk about it ?
how real is your relationship ?
real is when someone finds out that you &apos;re in the hospital
and drops everything because she doesn &apos;t want you
to be freaked out and alone .
look , i &apos;m not trying to be mean .
it &apos;s just , you ever think you might be
settling for something here ?
we &apos;ve @-@ we &apos;ve all done it .
talked ourselves into the penguin
because we didn &apos;t think we had a shot at the elephant .
if i &apos;m your elephant ,
you have a shot .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m trying to say , dummy .
i &apos;m glad he &apos;s finally asleep .
he kept going on about beth israel in hospital .
i told him his insurance is fine .
we can do the surgery here .
beth israel ?
oh , my god . andy , are you okay ?
he &apos;s okay , right ?
uh , yeah , he &apos;s sleeping .
oh , thank god .
i &apos;m beth , andy &apos;s girlfriend .
oh . hi . uh , haley .
of course .
andy &apos;s told me so much about you .
i &apos;m so sorry about missing the carnival .
i &apos;ve just been up for two days straight .
well , you &apos;re here , so i should go .
okay . thanks again .
listen , listen .
it worked . he stopped crying .
oh , so good for him . i &apos;m glad . so listen .
who are these beautiful people ?
they must be cousins of yours ?
yes , they are --
wait a minute .
you turned it off .
and i thought that he was finally getting over his binky !
the screaming is driving me crazy !
the screaming is driving everyone crazy , gloria .
you either have to turn this thing off ,
or i &apos;m going up there
and giving him my keys to suck on .
hey @-@ o ! how &apos;s my beautiful wife ?
what happened ? why do you look like that ?
i &apos;m just happy to see you .
you look like a crazy person .
dad , what are you doing with your face ? come on .
did anyone else notice that joe stopped crying ?
back from the talent show early . don &apos;t ask why .
i love it when children have talent .
why are you smiling like that ?
did something happen to mom ?
put your face back to what it used to be .
come on , dad . just drop it .
so now i &apos;m too happy .
make up your damn minds !
there he is .
i &apos;ve got it .
dad , i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t mean to upset you .
save it , claire .
i watched what we shot today .
yeah , i &apos;m not that cheery ,
likeable celebrity i was 30 years ago .
i am an old grump now .
when did i turn that corner ?
you haven &apos;t . you haven &apos;t .
i mean , you &apos;re creeping up to it .
you got your blinker on , but ... you haven &apos;t yet .
i saw it happen to my dad , you know ?
one day , hap @-@ go @-@ lucky rotary drill operator ,
the next he &apos;s rowing his schlitz at the tv
&apos;cause some lady sportscaster came on .
i swore i &apos;d never be like that .
you &apos;re not that bad . if you were ,
why would we all spend all our time over here ?
oh , you just come here for the pool .
that &apos;s not ... that &apos;s not true .
no . crazy .
dad , you are a long way from turning into grandpa .
you know , i was with him
the first time he saw sushi in the grocery store .
he grabbed the price check mic
and treated us all to a little lecture on pearl harbor .
you just have to fight it a little .
i appreciate it , honey .
i &apos;m not sure some of this
just isn &apos;t natural order of things .
bogey at 10 : 00 ! move it !
this is not a drill !
what ?
gentlemen , on my count ,
let slip the dogs of war !
what the hell are you three doing out here ? !
now if we have a prayer at this thing ,
we have to triangulate .
phil , stay where you are .
luke , by the tree . give me some of those oranges .
here you go .
now let &apos;s go on my count ,
&apos;cause nobody starts at 8 .
get the hell off the space above my lawn !
take a look at this . look at this .
we did it !
we did it !
drone 2 , idiots 1 !
some boys need a little help ,
but not all boys .
no binky .
all right , dad , we &apos;re ready for you .
just give us five minutes .
seems like a waste of time , but go ahead .
closet , but no cigar .
why ? because we closet .
i &apos;ll have what she &apos;s closet .
mama always said
life is like a box of closets .
on your mark , get set , closet .
let &apos;s get ready to closet !
say hello to my little closet .
damn it . they all good .
