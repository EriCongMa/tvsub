zum wohl !
bitte , meine freunde .
in memory of the not @-@ so @-@ dearly departed herr spielman ...
no .
no .
... who undercut and robbed you
on the supply routes through graz ,
i &apos;ll double what he was spending
and handle the packaging and transit myself .
zum wohl !
donald !
there you are .
i told you i &apos;d pick you up at the airport .
the cab ride must have cost you a fortune .
guten tag , alles .
oh , is this ...
donald is my man at the state department .
he &apos;s been extremely helpful in all our endeavors here .
but the poor fellow
has to walk a terrible tightrope every single day .
i feel obliged to get him drunk once in a while ,
so i invited him down to celebrate . yeah !
celebrate what , red ?
free trade , donald . free trade .
freihandel .
honestly , this damn chip . what the hell do you want ?
keen needs you .
then why isn &apos;t she here ?
you mean why didn &apos;t she fly to munich on 10 minutes &apos; notice ?
you made the trip .
she &apos;s been detained .
by whom ?
the situation &apos;s above my security clearance .
i was just given the job of locating you .
no , you said she &apos;s been detained . is she in danger ?
there &apos;s a jet on the tarmac at munich international .
my plane &apos;s faster .
i just can &apos;t believe he &apos;s gone .
i &apos;m never gonna hear him say my name .
or smell that old aftershave .
it &apos;s different with you because you --
you can trace your life up to this moment , you know ?
you have reliable records and ...
you had your dad .
yeah .
do you want me in here right now ?
i love you .
watch the time . you got work in a little bit .
it &apos;s all right .
donald , what the hell are you doing ?
taking you into protective custody .
where &apos;s agent keen ?
i lied to you , red . you must be slipping .
i must be .
everybody , out .
why am i in handcuffs , harold ?
you &apos;re violating our arrangement .
there &apos;s an imminent threat to your life .
that condition is a constant .
we have credible intelligence
that you &apos;re being targeted for assassination .
my contacts at the cia were sitting on an egyptian sleeper cell .
they intercepted communication
between them and an informant called wells .
hilton wells ?
you obviously know him .
you obviously don &apos;t .
hilton wells doesn &apos;t speak with the egyptians .
he hasn &apos;t since he aligned himself with mubarak
during the arab spring .
i can show you the transcripts .
with all due respect , if the intel were worth having ,
then i would have it .
there &apos;s a price on your head .
there &apos;s a running price on my head , agent ressler .
anslo garrick ?
listen to me .
if this intel was disseminated ,
it was done so directly to you .
it &apos;s canned ,
which means anslo garrick intends to attack this facility .
oh , you think he wanted us to bring you here ?
what do i think ?
i think we have a songbird in our midst ,
and until i find out who &apos;s singing , i don &apos;t trust anyone
because someone helped to bring him here .
to a black site . why ?
because i &apos;m asymmetrical .
i don &apos;t need visas , passports , travel documents .
give me a bug @-@ out bag and 30 seconds ,
and i &apos;m on my way to anywhere in the world .
garrick knows this .
he needs me contained , landlocked .
so he fed you phony intel
to trigger your security protocol
and now you &apos;ve done exactly as he wished .
he got you to bring me here
so that he could attack this facility .
he doesn &apos;t even know this place exists .
all he does is extract people from places that don &apos;t exist ,
places exactly like this .
garrick exfils high @-@ level detainees
always by considerable force .
park the truck near the elevator bank .
he liberated mahmoud al azok
from an alcatraz @-@ like cia black site in the bering sea .
that was shining path , a splinter cell .
azok has ties to a caribbean money launderer .
no . that was garrick ,
paid by that same peruvian money launderer
to make it appear as though shining path broke him out .
a7安检口 正在核对信息
it was garrick .
whoa . no , no , no . whoa , whoa .
you can &apos;t be here ! hey ! tell him he can &apos;t be here !
now open the compactor .
he almost exclusively works with a group of heavily armed ,
highly skilled mercenaries
who call themselves the wild bunch ....
... former flag wavers made over in frankenstein @-@ like fashion
into bloodless , country @-@ less killers .
garrick is not a precision instrument .
he &apos;s a blunt @-@ force object ...
and seemingly immune to bullets .
i can attest to this first @-@ hand
having put one in his head years ago at point @-@ blank range .
harold , this building is about to be breached .
they &apos;re in .
elevator &apos;s disabled . transmission &apos;s jammed .
we have takedown .
hello ?
initiate full facility lockdown .
第一季 第九集
安索 · 加里克
telecom is dead . i have no signal .
get me out of these damn cuffs .
you &apos;re going into the box until the threat is neutralized .
neutralized ? harold , do not make a stand .
get your people the hell out of here .
all non @-@ essential and unarmed personnel
evacuate via southeast stairwells .
carry code oriole baton 338 .
anyone not presenting this code upon egress will be detained .
hello ?
hello ? !
relay , relay , relay , seize state .
assume all comm lines compromised .
rally point 14 @-@ 14 @-@ 6 .
the armory ?
we need to get to our own weapons before they do .
this is director cooper authorizing a full data burn .
destroy onsite drives and terminals
and burst transmit all backup data
to the central servers at quantico .
i don &apos;t think you appreciate the sheer firepower
that has entered this building .
shut up .
he means to take me , agent ressler ,
and kill anyone in his way or in his wake .
this isn &apos;t about digging in . this is about escape .
wait .
why not let them have me , donald ?
i &apos;ll likely be tortured for weeks and left to rot
until they finally deign to put a bullet in my skull .
wouldn &apos;t that please you ?
you &apos;re an adjunct informant for the fbi , reddington .
that means you &apos;re my responsibility .
that means i fight for your life
regardless of how badly i want to take it .
don &apos;t , reddington .
don &apos;t leave me unarmed .
donald , you and i aren &apos;t done just yet .
hello , red .
we &apos;re going up .
red ...
red , did you really think there was a distance you could cover
or a hole deep enough that you could hide in ?
there is nowhere in this world
that i cannot reach you , red .
fortification be damned .
i heard you made yourself
some sweet little immunity deal , red .
i heard that you fitted the fbi with strings ,
and now they hang upon your hip like a hatchet .
not bad .
prudent .
but they can &apos;t keep you safe from someone like me , red ,
someone who sat in blackness
for five years --
five years
thinking about the pain ...
i was going to inflict on you
while slowly breaking
your will , your body ,
and finally your mind .
that day is here , my friend .
and it will end with your screams ,
as god is my witness .
aram , can i get any kind of internal camera signal
or tap into our surveillance array ?
it would have to be hardwired , sir .
they &apos;ve knocked out the grids .
what about the telecom signal ? could it be restored ?
same thing . unfortunately ,
it would have to be hacked locally .
where would you hack it ?
main generator room would give me the best chance .
it has all the uplink terminals .
but the power &apos;s down .
it won &apos;t matter .
our backup generator should enable the uplink
and allow me to splice a separate signal from the telecom .
do you have a radio ?
yeah .
good . tune it to emr @-@ designation
&quot; hatchling . &quot;
understood ?
get to the main generator room .
kill anything that isn &apos;t fbi .
go .
closed comms . closed comms .
go to emr @-@ designation channel --
codify , &quot; hatchling . &quot;
codify , &quot; hatchling . &quot;
hatchling @-@ 5591 @-@ abstract .
keen ?
i &apos;m here , sir .
do not attempt any form of ingress .
hostiles have the high ground .
i &apos;m already inside .
have you been captured ? are you injured ?
neither .
where are you ?
barricaded inside the armory .
ressler and reddington are unaccounted for , presumed down .
what are you feeling in your extremities ?
what do you feel ?
not much .
my fingers are numb . my face is getting cold .
shock is setting in .
how much blood have i lost ?
more than a thimbleful .
what about my leg ?
lay down . lay down .
donald , never let it be said that i valued
a zegna venticinque tie over a human life ,
even yours .
take up a handful of your own tie .
this is gonna be hugely unpleasant and very painful .
bite down .
all right ?
yeah . keep pressure on it . just keep pressure on it .
i don &apos;t like his chances , red .
that leg looks like minced beef .
all you have to do to save agent ressler &apos;s life
is come out , red .
don ...
we never met in person , don ,
but if you &apos;d done your job back in brussels in &apos; 08,
i wouldn &apos;t be here now .
agent ressler here ran that little kick murder squad
tried to clip you in waterloo station , red .
i gave him your train number , your itinerary .
all little donnie here had to do was supply the bullet ,
but no .
bungled !
and now , as fate has a great fondness
for moments like these ,
here we are .
and it is you , red ,
that can spare or end
agent ressler &apos;s life .
you know , anslo , i &apos;m looking at you ,
and i got to say i &apos;m really surprised .
with the access you now have to top @-@ notch plastic surgeons ,
why you haven &apos;t done something --
anything -- about that horrific scar .
i mean , how do you wake up to that
staring back at you in the mirror every morning ?
but you know what ? it &apos;s not the scar .
it &apos;s really the eye .
but , hey , lucky you .
i normally carried hydra @-@ shok hollow points .
i was trying out a new
series of center @-@ fire wadcutters that week .
it &apos;s probably the only thing that saved your life , really --
me switching ammo .
think about that little irony now
every time you randomly find your reflection
or are reminded of that ...
unfortunate thing i &apos;ve done to your face .
think about it .
you trashed a one @-@ of @-@ a @-@ kind partnership .
we were never partners , anslo .
you violated whatever trust i had in you .
so , naturally , i did what i always did ...
and beat you .
and you did what you always did -- got beaten by me .
true to form , anslo .
why take time to think when it &apos;s so much easier to shoot ?
this glass was developed by darpa
for secure cover and housing in combat zones .
that .45 might as well be a spit straw .
oh , good , red .
i &apos;ve brought a whole picnic basket to this party .
and , little pig , little pig ,
you are going to let me come in .
okay , let &apos;s go .
oh , calm , calm , calm .
come on , come on , come on .
use your training . use your training .
be fluid . be fluid .
okay . all right .
oh , man .
command down . command down . armory overrun .
repeat , armory overrun .
help !
please , help !
help !
can someone help me ? please help !
lower your gun to your side .
now reach across your body with your right hand
and remove your tactical belt .
any sudden or aggressive movements , and i will kill you .
okay .
let me see .
oh , no .
oh , no .
we don &apos;t have enough explosives .
what ?
we don &apos;t have enough explosives ,
not according to the specs we pulled up on this thing .
tabletop to blue wolf .
send a short chalk back to the armory .
we &apos;re a little light on bang here .
so you bring me back
every piece of explosive ordnance that they have .
donald , i &apos;m gonna quietly cross my fingers before i ask ,
but what blood type are you ?
b @-@ negative .
and you thought we had nothing in common .
there &apos;s only 2 % of us , you know ?
what are you doing ?
you need a blood transfusion .
or we &apos;re gonna have to open that door ,
which will likely be the end of both of us .
give me a gun . these bastards want to go . let &apos;s go .
the concept of a last stand
sounds so heroically romantic , doesn &apos;t it , donald ?
but there &apos;s a good reason why we didn &apos;t see
what happened to butch and sundance .
being riddled by bullets and left to rot
under a scorching bolivian sky does not a sequel make .
and if you &apos;ve surmised nothing about me by now , know this .
i &apos;m gonna be around for the sequel .
you &apos;re really gonna do a field transfusion ?
oh , come now , donald .
think how much smarter you &apos;ll be afterwards .
why the hell are you doing this ?
it &apos;s pretty obvious i hate your guts ,
and i can &apos;t imagine you hold a whole lot of warmth for me ,
especially after hearing about brussels .
i knew about brussels .
then why save me ?
because that &apos;s what you do when someone is dying in front of you .
allies today , enemies tomorrow --
the world is a complex place ,
further complicated by man &apos;s fickle nature .
years ago , i saved a man &apos;s life
under a beautiful old cedar tree in lebanon .
a month later ,
he tried to kill me in a hotel in damascus .
i understood . allegiances shift .
a month later ...
i broke his neck with a shower caddy .
it &apos;s this job today , another one tomorrow .
that needle in your arm becomes the one in your neck .
it &apos;s just that fast .
red .
do you remember that roadrunner cartoon where the coyote
makes the mountain of tnt and gunpowder barrels ?
and blows himself sky @-@ high ?
yes , anslo . is that what you &apos;re doing out there ?
is this to be mass suicide by explosion , i hope ?
no . we &apos;ll be fine out here , red .
but with these charges rigged to blow inward ,
i can &apos;t say the same about you .
it &apos;s no matter .
i intend to thoroughly torture the hell
out of whatever &apos;s left of you .
oh , come on !
play with me !
i &apos;d give that leg up as a lost cause by now , wouldn &apos;t you ?
if sepsis hasn &apos;t set in by now , donnie , it will .
and then your body
will slowly start to poison its own blood supply .
including that little keg tap
that reddington &apos;s giving you right now .
drip , drip , don .
drip , drip , drip .
raines ?
raines ?
respond now or i &apos;m gonna shoot .
in three ... two ... one .
tabletop to chalk one , where &apos;s my bang ?
let &apos;s go . i &apos;ve got a box to blow up .
tell him you &apos;re on your way back .
tell him anything other than that ,
and you &apos;re lying with your buddy .
chalk one to tabletop , we &apos;re on our way back now .
that &apos;s good .
liz .
agent keen , it &apos;s me .
what the hell are you doing here ?
i could ask you the same . where did you come from ?
i snuck in .
what are you doing ?
trying to restore the telecom
so we can call in the cavalry .
where is everyone ?
captured .
where &apos;s red and ressler ?
i think ressler &apos;s in bad shape .
any idea who hit this facility ?
someone called garrick .
he &apos;s disabled telecom ,
simplex , and duplex signals .
how long before you can restore the telecom ?
i haven &apos;t been able to hack around it .
they are jamming the signal internally .
how ?
uh , based on just the waveform readings and the wattage output ,
it &apos;s , uh , something powerful , uh , but portable .
where would they place it ?
all the uplink and communication relays
are in the subfloor garage .
could you reset the telecom if the jammers were disabled ?
it would automatically reset , yeah .
good .
you got a weapon ?
uh , yeah . why ?
&apos;cause ...
we &apos;re gonna go find those jammers .
&quot; we &quot; ?
yes . you and i in the plural .
uh , but i @-@ i @-@ i thought i &apos;m waiting for the signal
so we can call the cavalry .
we are the cavalry . give me your gun .
um , i @-@ i &apos;ve only shot at paper .
pretend they &apos;re paper .
donald .
donald !
feeling any wittier yet ?
any strange cravings for
beluga caviar or marcel proust ?
i know you don &apos;t think much of me ,
but you don &apos;t get assigned a case file like yours
unless you pass muster .
may i ask you something
with the hope that you won &apos;t take offense ?
you already know it &apos;s gonna offend me . ask anyway .
what happened to audrey bidwell ?
she left me .
you were engaged .
to her , yeah .
it was my engagement with you that ended that relationship .
five years , i chased you .
five years trying to make my name .
look where it &apos;s gotten me .
chalk two to tabletop ,
one dead , one down .
we have an enemy within .
we have a monkey wrench running around in here somewhere .
find them .
how did you know about my ex ?
i know a great many things about you , donald .
right .
it &apos;s the core of your business -- information .
misinformation .
i don &apos;t know how you did it , reddington .
forsaking the flag , abandoning your country .
we become who we are .
we can &apos;t judge a book by its cover ...
but you can by its first few chapters
and , most certainly , by its last .
so , what &apos;s it all about , then , the blacklist ? revenge ?
oh , revenge is too easy and over so quickly .
i would hope for more than that .
we &apos;re not gonna live through this .
i think we will .
how ?
have you ever sailed across an ocean , donald ?
no .
on a sailboat surrounded by sea with no land in sight ?
without even the possibility of sighting land for days to come ?
to stand at the helm of your destiny --
i want that one more time .
i want to be in the piazza del campo in siena ,
to feel the surge as ... 10 racehorses go thundering by .
i want another meal in paris
at l &apos;ambroisie in the place des vosges .
i want another bottle of wine .
and then another .
i want the warmth of a woman in a cool set of sheets .
one more night of jazz at the vanguard .
i want to stand on summits and smoke cubans
and feel the sun on my face for as long as i can .
walk on the wall again .
climb the tower . ride the river .
stare at the frescos .
i want to sit in the garden and read one more good book .
most of all , i want to sleep .
i want to sleep like i slept when i was a boy .
give me that .
just ... one time .
that &apos;s why i won &apos;t allow that punk out there
to get the best of me ...
let alone the last of me .
what do you want ?
this isn &apos;t about what i want ,
assistant director cooper .
no .
what i &apos;ve wanted , i &apos;ve simply taken .
this is about what i need .
and what i need is access to that box .
then let &apos;s start with what i need ,
which is all of my people released right now .
you &apos;re not in charge , harold .
no . but i am the man who can get you into that box .
and if i go in there
and start kneecapping your people one by one
until you give me what i want ?
then you &apos;re not getting reddington .
no . i &apos;m going to bet someone other than you
can get me into that box .
then place that bet .
agent keen .
okay , i think we &apos;re cool .
there you go again , anslo ,
using a pistol in place of a brain .
you gonna put a bullet
in the head of the man who can hand you mine ?
i think someone &apos;s trying to save your life .
hardly .
i have little to no use for that man .
but before you shoot him ,
be absolutely certain that i &apos;m not outsmarting you .
we know how frequently that &apos;s happened in the past .
it would be a shame if in killing him
you denied yourself of the prize that you came here for .
anslo !
how long do you think you can hold out here
before half of quantico &apos;s graduating class
rappels down on top of you ?
red , this time you are quite simply mistaken .
the question really is , how long are you going to hold out ?
are you really going to let agent ressler there just expire ?
are you really going to let me put
assistant director cooper &apos;s head all over that wall ?
how many people are going to die here today , reddington ?
what &apos;s happening ?
your heart is pumping harder and harder ,
trying to compensate for blood loss .
and that shotgun blast broke your leg .
i think it also partially ruptured your femoral artery .
partially ?
you would have bled out by now
if the hole were any bigger ,
but now i have to close it .
close it how ?
by cauterizing it .
i &apos;m gonna have to cut open your leg to get at the artery
and then sprinkle some combustible compound on it
and ignite it .
donald , if you don &apos;t tell them how to open that door ,
i have to do this , or you will die .
then do it .
grab ahold of the bench back there and don &apos;t let go .
i &apos;m gonna cut as fast as i can ,
but i can &apos;t have you trying to stop me once i start , okay ?
yeah .
this is gonna hurt .
hold still , donald . this will be over in a second .
how many of these things would they need
to scramble the telecom signal ?
uh , several . but just disabling two should be enough
for the uplink to reset and re @-@ establish a signal .
just -- it won &apos;t be anywhere near full strength .
cellular ?
you might have one bar .
it &apos;s not enough .
this will be faster if we split up .
and scarier .
but yeah .
faster , right . sure .
okay .
10 seconds , red .
wait .
10 ... 9 ...
harold ! open the box now !
... 8 ...
give him the code !
no .
anslo , my people can help you .
... 6 ...
cooper can get you in here .
... 5 ...
put that gun to his head .
... 4 ... 3 ...
for once in your life , stop and think about -- - ... 2 ... 1 .
hello , love .
threat is down . repeat , the threat is down .
red , i don &apos;t have to explain what happens now , do i ?
down .
would you prefer that i did the countdown ?
because i wasn &apos;t that keen , frankly .
you open the box , or dembe dies .
harold , tell him .
wait . ressler knows the code .
wait is over , red . people are dying now .
ressler . ressler !
raymond .
ressler !
ressler !
raymond !
ours is a friendship forged once in this life ...
and again in the next .
goodbye , my brother .
harold , open this box .
i &apos;ll give you anything .
stay on your knees .
no . stay on your knees . stay on your knees .
well , i &apos;m gonna kill him now , aren &apos;t i , red ?
open the box !
