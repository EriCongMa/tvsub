chopper one , we have a report of a body in presidio park .
chopper one , copy . en route .
confirming dead body , male ,
mid @-@ 30s , badly beaten , single gunshot to the head .
well ?
we need to call the fbi .
it &apos;s starting again .
you hungry ? you want to grab something ?
don &apos;t try and act like you care .
i just want to know if you &apos;re hungry .
no , i &apos;m not hungry .
i &apos;m not the enemy , jane .
of course not . my friends are , right ?
and david .
you &apos;re 14 .
it &apos;s too young to go on dates ,
especially with a boy who &apos;s already driving .
mom thinks you work too much .
what does that have to do with anything ?
it &apos;s not my fault that you two don &apos;t get along .
i &apos;m not saying it is .
you &apos;re trying to ship me off .
your mom and i love you .
don &apos;t even .
ok . you want to be treated like an adult , fine .
let &apos;s have an adult conversation .
can i help you ?
what do you think &apos;s going on with the helicopters tonight ?
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m trying to have a convertion with my daughter .
i wasn &apos;t talking to you .
i was talking to jane .
how do you know my daughter &apos;s name ?
you &apos;re not in charge here .
jane , run ahead .
no !
no , you come quiet .
or you both die .
hotch .
cooper .
you never were one for offices .
a medical condition .
i &apos;m allergic to bureaucracy .
thanks for coming , hotch .
sure . i don &apos;t have long . we &apos;re leaving on a case .
i know . san francisco .
i hear things .
so what &apos;s going on ?
how much you know about this case you &apos;re working ?
i &apos;m on my way in to look at the files .
can i give you a preview ?
sure .
all right , so , here &apos;s the deal .
2 years ago , a dead male turned up in presidio park .
a massive amount of blunt force trauma .
defensive wounds , single gunshot
to the back of the head .
and over the next 3 days ,
3 more vics , same m. o.
and after that , there was nothing .
until exactly one year later .
same thing .
dead male , badly beaten ,
shot execution style ,
followed by 3 more vics
over the next 3 days .
and then nothing until last night .
one year later . exactly .
which means we have 3 days before the trail goes cold again .
why all the interest ?
i got a theory .
i think there are parallel murders
linked to these cases .
2 years ago , one day after those murders stopped ,
a single dad and his 15 @-@ year @-@ old brunette daughter
were found dead in their car .
last year ...
again , one day after the dead males stopped showing up ,
same thing . another dad and his brunette daughter .
and you think it &apos;s all connected ?
i think it &apos;s a hell of a coincidence , don &apos;t you ?
and you want me to bring your team in on the case .
you only have 3 days . i mean , you don &apos;t have time
to be chasing an angle like this one .
so my team works the bodies in presidio park
while your team tests the theory
about the fathers and daughters .
and if i &apos;m right ,
both halves of the case help solve the other half .
and you already asked the director and she said no .
she is not strong at thinking outside the box .
if you ignore her order and you &apos;re wrong ,
you &apos;re done .
i &apos;m telling you , hotch ...
right now , there &apos;s a father and there &apos;s a daughter
and they &apos;re missing ,
and no one is looking for them .
stop it . shh ! stop it .
if i can snap this chain ...
you &apos;re just gonna hurt yourself .
stop it , please , please !
please stop it !
you ok ?
stop !
you stay away from her .
i said get away from her .
what the hell do you want ?
it &apos;s simple .
you give her to me ,
you both live .
go to hell .
if that &apos;s your answer .
mother teresa said ,
&quot; i have found the paradox .
&quot; that if you love until it hurts ,
&quot; there can be no more hurt ,
only more love . &quot;
what do we know about the past years &apos; victims ?
the tenderloin district is a high concentration
of drug addicts and homeless people .
all the victims have been transients .
so this unsub &apos;s choosing easy targets that won &apos;t be missed .
he &apos;s not concerned with the challenge of the hunt .
all these victims are part of a larger plan .
which he executes in the same few days every year .
reid did you find any significance to the dates ?
nothing historical .
it &apos;s got to be personal for the unsub .
jj , you and reid hit the san francisco p.d.
rossi and prentiss to the dumpsite .
morgan and i will go to the coroner &apos;s office .
nobody should expect to get a lot of sleep in the next 3 days .
what about cooper &apos;s team ?
you said he had a theory .
he believes that whoever is murdering these homeless men
is also abducting fathers and daughters
and killing them once the transients are disposed of .
so then we &apos;ll investigate the dead men ,
and his team can see if there is
a missing father and daughter .
why isn &apos;t his team on the jet now ?
because the director wouldn &apos;t authorize
them joining the investigation .
they &apos;re working against the director &apos;s orders ?
we need to concentrate on the dead men
abducted from the tenderloin .
cooper &apos;s team can help determine
if there &apos;s a missing father and daughter
and whether it &apos;s connected to our case .
or you could get in serious hot water
if the director thinks you &apos;re helping to defy her .
no , hotch is right .
i &apos;ve known sam cooper for 20 years ,
and i &apos;ve never seen him defy an order .
if he feels this strong about a hunch ,
we need to help him however we can .
trying to get out of the heavy lifting , eh ?
actually , i &apos;m setting up a two @-@ way ilnb
with a 500 @-@ megawatt transmitter
and single @-@ polarity lnb ,
both operating in the k.u. band .
what did she just say to me ?
at least we &apos;re blessed with a nice setup .
how &apos;d you hook it up ?
i know a guy who knows a guy
who &apos;s a slumlord , who gave us a great deal .
so , how do we conjure victims of a crime
that might not have been committed out of thin air
in a major american city ?
san francisco has a population of 800,000 .
half of those are males .
just start with the females .
only 45 % of the population is white .
so what does that leave ?
360,000 .
that &apos;s gets us to 180,000 .
check school absences .
narrow that to girls 13 to 18
and narrow it again to brunettes .
find their fathers &apos; names and check their workplaces ,
who hasn &apos;t shown up .
well , ok . if you want to show off about it .
all right . let &apos;s ride .
let &apos;s get to work .
have all the dumpsites been this isolated ?
he keeps away from the main paths .
never dumps them in lighted areas .
so he had to have studied the terrain beforehand .
he &apos;s organized .
and physical enough to haul a body
a long way on his own .
what can you tell us about the victims ?
they were all living on the streets .
no witnesses .
our guess is he managed to lure them ,
promising food or drugs .
were any reported missing ?
no . we do know they all came from the same few blocks
in the tenderloin .
this is the body they found at presidio park .
if he hadn &apos;t been shot ,
he probably would have died of internal bleeding .
it looks like he landed a few shots of his own .
there &apos;s powder residue in his skull .
he had to have been subdued when he was shot .
so he gets abducted off the street
quietly enough that there &apos;s no witnesses ,
but then he fights for his life only to let the unsub
shoot him execution style ?
in other words , what the hell is he doing with them ?
unlock &apos; em .
not yet !
get up .
let &apos;s go .
throw the key off to the side .
you win , you live .
you lose ,
i kill your daughter ,
and i kill you .
understand ?
can you stand ?
can you stand ?
don &apos;t look , jane .
ok , we &apos;ve talked to over 200 middle schools
and run the names of absent girls
against their yearbook photos .
what else ?
we &apos;re checking bios of the dads now
and calling their workplaces .
so he hasn &apos;t been at work .
you sure ?
both days ?
thank you .
what have we got ?
this is jane mcbride .
she &apos;s 14 . she didn &apos;t show up for school
yesterday or this morning .
and dad ?
ben .
he hasn &apos;t been at his contracting company for the last 2 days .
i love this guy .
and the prophet speaks .
yes . yes .
hotch .
cooper .
i think we found him .
mrs. mcbride ? i &apos;m agent hotchner with the fbi .
this is agent cooper .
we &apos;re here to determine whether
your husband and your daughter are missing .
don &apos;t .
ma &apos;am , are you ok ?
just get inside , please .
hurry .
oh , god .
mrs. mcbride .
you just got my family murdered .
that &apos;s the first victim from the park .
the man on the phone said he &apos;d kill ben and jane
if i brought in the police .
he said that if i needed proof , i should check my front porch ,
and when i did , this was there .
oh , he &apos;s careful .
nothing to distinguish him
or his location .
were there any other instructions ?
no , he said he &apos;d call with more .
do you think he &apos;s watching ?
i mean , is he going to kill them ?
the video was shot by a camera on a tripod ,
which means he probably doesn &apos;t have a partner .
it would be almost impossible
for him to take your family prisoner
and do surveillance simultaneously .
and he &apos;s done this before ?
so why didn &apos;t someone come forward after to say what happened ?
he doesn &apos;t leave anybody with knowledge alive .
we &apos;ll post an agent here to keep you safe .
can you excuse us a moment ?
cooper , listen .
your theory &apos;s right . we know he &apos;s killing homeless men
as well as fathers and daughters .
but let us work it .
if you go back to d . c. now , the director
won &apos;t know that you ignored her order .
look , i know you &apos;re sticking your neck out on this thing for me .
i understand . i &apos;m not trying to--
this isn &apos;t about me .
i want to protect you .
you remember him ?
toby vahl . of course .
you remember we got that confession
for those 5 child murders ,
but we all had that gut feeling .
we knew he wasn &apos;t good for all of them .
the preference was too varied .
local cops shut the investigation down .
the fbi brass , they told us to get our asses back home .
i remember .
where were you when you heard
they caught that second killer dumping this boy &apos;s body ?
i was in denver working a new case .
you ?
i wasn &apos;t on anything yet .
i could have still been there .
i won &apos;t ignore my gut again .
i don &apos;t care what it costs me .
ok .
my people will be on the record
and we &apos;ll use yours to double manpower .
hotchner .
where ?
ok .
they found another body .
so how does a brit--
a handsome brit .
how does a brit end up in the fbi ?
it &apos;s pretty simple .
cooper and i bumped into each other a few times .
10 months ago they told him he could hand @-@ pick a new team .
he called . i came . passport didn &apos;t matter .
so , is it true
that no one in the british special forces
is allowed to admit they &apos;re in it ?
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;d have to ask around about that one .
you know , there &apos;s a lot of rumors about your boss .
yeah ?
one i heard was when he left the bau ,
he was doing psychological ops overseas .
well ... i &apos;ve never been big on rumors .
so , i don &apos;t suppose you &apos;re going to tell me
just where you two bumped into each other .
i &apos;ll tell you i trust the man with my life .
i &apos;ll tell you i &apos;d die for the man .
how &apos;s the mom ?
she &apos;s holding up .
i don &apos;t know how much help she &apos;s going to be .
so , the tenderloin is full of junkies
who would be easy to control ,
but the first victim had no drugs in his system ,
and this geezer looks pretty healthy , too .
except for the whole dead thing .
there &apos;s skin under his nails .
didn &apos;t the first victim have scratch marks on his chest ?
yeah . we assumed he fought back against the unsub ,
but these victims might actually be fighting each other .
exactly .
i take it you &apos;re about to wow me with a theory .
the first victim is dumped
before the fathers and daughters are taken .
why ?
because he wants to send a message to the wife
that he means business , make sure she doesn &apos;t call the police .
and it also sends a message to the prisoners he already has .
you lose a fight , you die .
what do those welts look like to you ?
my guess--they &apos;re wounds from rubber bullets .
like they use to control rioters or prison inmates .
ok .
i think the unsub &apos;s been locked up .
that &apos;s where he &apos;s learned to control his own prisoners .
well , if he &apos;s learned how to dominate them ,
why are they fighting each other ?
it has to be part of his plan--
to watch them beat the hell out of each other .
and then the loser is executed .
admit it--i &apos;m starting to grow on you .
hotch , it &apos;s emily .
we have an idea about what he might be doing with the victims .
we may be able to give the profile--
hold on a second .
hey , who are you calling ?
if i &apos;m right , there &apos;s somewhere else
we need to be delivering that profile .
this is one for the books , huh ?
yeah . you spend much time here ?
maybe a half a dozen interviews .
you ?
6 years , 3 months , 4 days .
the prophet returns .
what up , man ? how you doin &apos; ?
this is nelson g.
me and him know each other from back in the dark days .
man . never expected to ever see you in here again .
this is agent david rossi , fbi .
fbi ? the first time i see you in how long
and you bring the fbi ?
get the hell outta here .
i told you , man ,
if i ever got my shot at redemption ,
i was gonna take my game to the other side .
&quot; to open the blind eyes ,
&quot; to take the prisoner out of the prison and them ...
and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house . &quot;
well ... it makes sense , i guess .
the criminals are the ones who make the rules , right ?
cops are the ones who gotta learn .
i need your help , man .
talk .
we have a serial killer .
we think he might have done time here .
we want to give you a description ,
and then you tell us if you recognize him .
just press your connections .
it &apos;s very likely that this unsub has a prison record .
he &apos;s white , and judging by the age
of the people he abducts , most likely in his 30s .
and considering the terrain in which he &apos;s dumping the bodies ,
we think that he &apos;s imposing
or at least very physically fit .
he also has access to a space
that &apos;s large enough to house and control a number of prisoners ,
all without disturbing the neighbors .
this guy keeps to the same hunting ground .
same dumpsite .
he &apos;s a control freak .
real organized .
also , he would have been obsessed with the guards ,
their methods of controlling the prisoners ,
especially in the yard .
this dude kills folks the same few days every year .
there &apos;s no way he &apos;s that obsessed
and he &apos;s not talking about it .
we think the man has a daughter of his own ,
most likely a brunette like jane .
the dates he chooses probably correspond to an event
involving his own daughter .
our guess is that he lost his daughter in some way
and it &apos;s symbolic of him not fighting for her in the first place .
a lot of times killers choose victims
that are surrogates for someone ,
like a wife or a mother .
in this case , we think his own guilt
is making him choose surrogates that represent himself .
the police department has the profile .
they &apos;ve tripled patrols in the tenderloin .
you know what ? i think we need profilers out here , too .
he could be out there
hunting for homeless men to fight the father .
this kid--best sniper i &apos;ve ever seen .
he could view a lot of ground from the rooftop .
are you comfortable on the ground solo ?
of course .
cooper &apos;s right . maybe we can catch him
trying to abduct another victim .
so , what you wearing ?
a gun .
hey , mick , explain something to me .
how come i &apos;m out on the street
and you &apos;re sitting on your butt on some roof ?
well , you heard the man .
do you really want me to expound on my own prowess ?
it &apos;s undignified .
stay on your headset .
all his victims are coming from this 4 @-@ block radius .
hey , jane , honey , i need you to save your strength .
you can &apos;t fight again .
i don &apos;t have a choice .
i don &apos;t care if they break every bone in my body .
i promise you i &apos;m not gonna stop .
ok , i &apos;ve got something .
i &apos;m not sure if it &apos;s anything ,
but southeast corner .
see the guy clocking the junkie ?
you care to expand on that ?
all i see are guys clocking junkies .
gray shirt .
yeah , i got him .
stay close . i &apos;m on my way .
he &apos;s heading south , ben .
fbi ! stop !
stop !
i didn &apos;t do anything !
why were you following that man ?
i knew he was holding . i just wanted a fix .
i don &apos;t distribute .
dad !
why keep this up ?
she &apos;s better off with me . we both know it .
soon , this will be all she knows .
you let her walk home from school every day on her own .
she &apos;ll be safe with me , ben .
she won &apos;t even miss you .
you won &apos;t break me !
then it &apos;s to the death .
to the death ,
or i kill jane .
to the death ,
or jane dies .
last chance .
i &apos;m so sorry .
sorry .
i &apos;m sorry .
did your analyst get us the data ?
yeah , i can lay it out for you .
good . let &apos;s cross @-@ reference it
against our potential suspect pool .
hello .
yeah , we can be there .
you up for a ride to san quentin ?
it &apos;s like the old days ,
spending all your time interviewing prisoners .
don &apos;t go getting sentimental on me .
what we got ?
profile says he &apos;s spent time in prison .
and he probably lost a teenage daughter
in a way that corresponds to the dates
he abducts and kills his victims .
we have the dates in question divided into 4 specific subsets .
this group is teenage girls age 13 to 16
who were removed from their fathers &apos; care .
these are deaths of teenagers the same age .
the remainder are men arrested for violet crimes
and anyone serving a prison sentence during the same window .
the stressor &apos;s in here somewhere .
let &apos;s find something that looks promising
so we can start running background checks .
agent hotchner , erin strauss .
yes , ma &apos;am .
i &apos;m calling to check on the status of your case .
we &apos;re pursuing a secondary line of investigation .
and why is that ?
let me talk to her for a second .
hold a moment , please .
ma &apos;am ?
do you think i &apos;m stupid , agent cooper ?
no , ma &apos;am , uh , i do not think you &apos;re stupid .
is it unclear when i give an order ?
you should know that agent hotchner ,
he had nothing to do with this .
we need to be invited in by the locals .
you weren &apos;t .
you do realize that my theory was right ?
i want you back here today .
i can &apos;t do that .
excuse me ?
you can fire me tomorrow .
right now , i got less than 24 hours
before a father and a daughter turn up dead
somewhere in the city , and i refuse to be on an airplane
while the son of a bitch dumps their bodies .
now , with all- all possible respect ...
i gotta go . i have work to do .
tell agent hotchner
i will deal with the both of you when you get back .
so where were we ?
i want you to get inside the girl &apos;s head .
she &apos;s the key .
any insight can help us to break this thing .
we need to understand why he took this girl , at this time .
i asked around about you .
is it true you interviewed charles manson
before they transferred him out of here ?
3 straight days , 1988 .
what was he like ?
small .
small , huh ?
hey , you got something ?
i heard a story .
what kind of story ?
there &apos;s this big white dude
that was in before i got sent back .
supposedly he &apos;s all kinds of crazy .
finds out his daughter died , he goes all commando .
boxing , working out , challenging everyone in the yard ,
saying that he &apos;d fight them to the death .
sounds like it could be your guy .
yeah . keep talking .
the story is , it got so bad
that he started a beef with the officers here
and they finally put him in solitary confinement
to serve out the rest of his term .
you got a name ?
what are you doing ?
force of habit . my dad was army .
in my house we marched .
he must be proud of you .
all he knew is i gave up west point
for a long shot of someday getting into the fbi .
well , cooper obviously has a lot of faith in you .
he plucked you out of the academy , right ?
what is it ?
this collage .
jane is telling her parents
that they don &apos;t exist in her life .
that her interests are an entirely different culture
than her parents &apos; .
why would she keep a journal out
for anyone to read ?
what &apos;s in it ?
it &apos;s typical 14 @-@ year @-@ old stuff .
rants about her parents being unfair ,
talk about some boy named david .
ok , so she &apos;s defiant
and she wants her parents to read it .
no , but she &apos;s private .
she wouldn &apos;t commit these thoughts to paper in the first place .
unless it was forced on her .
your daughter &apos;s journal only goes back 9 months .
what made her start keeping it ?
we went to a family counselor
who suggested jane keep it .
where was the office ?
in the tenderloin district .
ok . got it . good work , morgan .
the mcbride family went to a therapy center in the tenderloin .
the place also did evaluations for social services .
we profiled that the unsub
may have had his daughter taken away from him .
if he was processed in the same place ,
then he would know how to target the fathers and daughters .
can i talk to your analyst ?
sure .
talk to me .
penelope garcia .
sam cooper .
sam cooper ?
as i live and breathe , and here i thought
you were a story someone invented .
what you got ?
here &apos;s what i need from you .
anyone processed by social services
who ended up losing a daughter .
i don &apos;t care how big the list is .
i can cross @-@ reference it against my others .
roger that .
gonna hack like the wind .
prepare to be wowed , sir .
jane .
i need you to listen to me ,
&apos;cause it might be the last time i ever get to talk to you .
i haven &apos;t been a good enough father .
you &apos;re 14 . you have no idea how terrifying that is .
so i &apos;ve tried to control what you do and who you see ,
because i wanted to keep you safe .
and i wanted you to go off to school
and get a good job
and maybe someday ...
fall in love ...
and ask me to walk you down the aisle .
i &apos;m still your dad ,
and it &apos;s my job
to look out for you .
but i haven &apos;t been a good listener .
i know you can hear me .
and i &apos;m not asking you to say anything .
i just want you to know that i understand
that i--that i can &apos;t control everything .
but i need the last words you hear me say ...
to be that i love you .
all right , my tribe , i have a list of parents ,
evaluated by social services ,
who ended up losing custody .
but as cooper predicted , it is a lengthy tale of woe .
we &apos;ll use it to cross against the teenage girls
who died on some of the dates in question .
i &apos;m going to start reading names .
you tell me if they &apos;re on your list .
maria salter , carla denny ...
hey .
joyce collard , dawn sparrow ...
right . sounds like a possible .
thanks , prophet .
we have a name .
a john vincent bell .
one of the girls who died was named mandy bell .
garcia , run the name john vincent bell
against the family therapy list .
shazzam .
bell and his wife divorced , then the wife died ,
and bell was declared incompetent
to have custody of the daughter
due to a host of mental health issues .
we got that one right .
oh , lord . and then , when social service agents
showed up to remove the girl ,
bell beat one of them to death ,
was given 7 years for manslaughter .
yeah . during which time , his daughter
was in a car accident .
looks like she survived 3 days on life support
but eventually died of brain injuries .
ok , so bell is making these men fight to the death
just like he did .
he &apos;s trying to prove he did what any father would do .
do we have an address ?
uh , the only listing i have is a gym
on hall street in the tenderloin .
it belongs to bell &apos;s family .
hasn &apos;t been operational for years .
we got him .
i watched jane &apos;s face when she saw what you did .
i told you you won &apos;t break me .
doesn &apos;t matter .
you already lost her .
but if you want to keep fighting ...
he &apos;s right .
jane .
i want you to take care of me .
what ?
my dad lied to me . he was gonna send me away .
all right , stop .
he &apos;s a liar .
i hate you .
janey , stop .
i will go anywhere you want . just please get away from him .
please .
no , she won &apos;t .
listen to me . stop this . i will kill you , you hear me ?
i will track you down and i will kill you .
i will kill you !
i don &apos;t think so .
wait !
you said if i go with you , we both live .
ok ? i need to know you &apos;re not a liar , too .
janey .
please .
don &apos;t do this .
what are you doing , jane ?
please ...
janey , please don &apos;t do this .
don &apos;t--what do you--jane !
janey !
janey !
jane !
jj .
go .
clear .
hotch .
drop your gun !
i need paramedics immediately to 631 hall street .
sir , where &apos;s your daughter jane ?
he took her .
how long ago ?
just a few minutes ago . find her .
please find her .
i will .
the place is clear .
he &apos;s on the street .
he &apos;s got the girl .
i &apos;ll stay with the father .
garcia , i need vehicle information
for john vincent bell .
tell police we need an apb .
gina ? cooper . you &apos;re on the move .
i can hit the rooftops .
good . go .
i need a helicopter .
garcia , tell san francisco p.d. we need a chopper .
i need everybody on their radios .
i &apos;m gonna be your eyes .
all right , come on .
there . right there .
we got a visual .
turk and franklin .
southeast corner .
we &apos;re 2 blocks away .
stop ! ow !
shut your mouth !
don &apos;t shine it on the street .
then why the hell are we up here ?
just give me the rooftop .
he can &apos;t escape up there .
this guy was locked alone in a box for 3 years .
if he feels trapped , his animal instinct &apos;s gonna kick in .
