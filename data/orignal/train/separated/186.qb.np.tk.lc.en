gossip girl here , your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
two years ago , the masculinity ball ,
i tried to tell you i loved you .
you loved me ?
i hope i &apos;m not interrupting .
we are so hard on you
because we want you to challenge yourself ,
to be your own person .
how exactly did you get graham
to ditch jenny for kira ?
i told graham that what happens at camp suisse
doesn &apos;t stay at camp suisse .
it &apos;s about who you &apos;ve become .
i liked you because you were different from everyone else .
i &apos;m sorry , eric , but it &apos;s over .
you were looking at vanessa
like you &apos;ve never looked at me .
you were the one that needed to kiss her again ,
to realize for yourself
that your feelings for her are real .
my wife isn &apos;t who i thought she was
and neither is my marriage . i don &apos;t know anything anymore .
i just know i don &apos;t want to be alone .
you went looking for your father ?
yeah , and i @-@ i found him , too , but he didn &apos;t want to see me .
thanksgiving began when the pilgrims and indians
came together to share the bountiful harvest .
okay , i &apos;ve got the stuffing .
and , jenny , you have the sweet potatoes , as usual .
eric , what &apos;s your tradition ?
i , um , don &apos;t think we van der woodsens
have any thanksgiving traditions .
serena apologizes ,
but she won &apos;t be able to make it tomorrow .
i stand corrected .
she has to work on thanksgiving ?
well , tripp has his staff
volunteering at a soup kitchen .
and with scott and his parents at the cape ,
and my mother still unable to travel ,
it looks like it &apos;s just going to be with us and daniel .
would you mind if i just walked down to grace &apos;s
and ordered one of their turkey dinners
so we don &apos;t have to cook ?
um , actually , lily , dad was just ...
thinking the same thing . keep it small , hassle @-@ free .
thank you .
sorry , rufus , but you can &apos;t really blame her .
our thanksgivings tend to end with french fries at a diner
and someone having been in a mental institution .
yeah , but why don &apos;t we show her
that this thanksgiving &apos;s gonna be different ?
well , there &apos;s nothing we can do about serena ,
but i can set up a video chat on my netbook
and give grandma a place at the table .
a cece you can unplug . that &apos;s perfect .
let &apos;s go give it a test run .
hey , why don &apos;t you invite jonathan ?
jonathan and i aren &apos;t really happening anymore .
what ? since when ?
a while now .
well , what happened ?
let &apos;s not talk about it .
on the upper east side , that tradition is upheld
with a bountiful harvest of secrets , lies and scandal .
what do you say to a thanksgiving truce ?
i know someone who misses you .
good afternoon , congressman .
i have the press schedule you asked for .
so did you talk to maureen yet ?
last night . she wasn &apos;t too happy about it ,
but she agreed to the divorce .
maureen &apos;s coming into town so our people
can write a joint statement explaining the split .
of course the public won &apos;t get the real reason .
and the real reason is ?
i &apos;m sorry . i just need to hear
that you &apos;re not leaving her because of me .
maureen orchestrated a fraud to win the election .
if you walked away right now , my decision wouldn &apos;t change .
but ...
i hope you won &apos;t .
i have to .
you &apos;re married , and as long as you are , we can &apos;t do this .
serena .
could our self @-@ imposed exile start after tomorrow ?
i can &apos;t bear the thought of spending thanksgiving alone .
well , i had a feeling you might say that ,
so i already told my mom
that you &apos;re making me work at the soup kitchen all day .
but this means pay @-@ per @-@ view movies
and room service at my hotel ,
and that &apos;s it .
i &apos;ll be good .
15 hours ... it &apos;s a record .
you haven &apos;t mentioned serena once . well ,
for much of that time , i was asleep ,
but since you &apos;re asking ,
i &apos;ve decided i &apos;m putting her out of my mind .
besides , i have a far more cunning and deceptive adversary
to deal with .
when does your mother land again ?
20 minutes .
flying in from paris to escort me back
how dumb does she think i am ? she has some bomb
she wants to drop on me in a controlled environment ,
surrounded by air marshals and french people .
amazing .
your holiday paranoia truly knows no bounds .
precedence is not paranoia .
when i called daddy last night
and started asking him questions ,
he clammed up faster than rihanna .
i need to find out my mother &apos;s secret
before boarding that plane .
oh , i didn &apos;t know the empire had hourly rates .
is nate home ? he &apos;s not answering his cell .
one van der bilt isn &apos;t enough ?
i &apos;m not having an affair with tripp ,
and since he is gonna find out anyway
he &apos;s leaving his wife , and it &apos;s not for me .
then what are you , exactly ,
an 18 @-@ year @-@ old , blonde coincidence ?
call me in six months ,
when he meets his next &quot; coincidence , &quot;
that is , if he even leaves his wife , which i highly doubt .
i told you it would end badly .
threesomes , man ... don &apos;t believe the hype .
yeah , but here &apos;s the thing ... olivia said she was leaving
because she thought that i @-@ i had feelings for vanessa .
do you ?
how would i even know ?
how &apos;d olivia know ?
well , she ... she said she saw a look on my face .
wait . you mean ... you mean during ?
oh , if this is not your next story for &quot; the new yorker , &quot;
i &apos;m sending it out to an entirely different magazine .
oh , thank you . that really helps .
oh , relax .
chances are you &apos;re right . it &apos;s just the threesome talking .
exactly . yes . say more things like that .
i mean , this is just a phase .
okay . all right . this is good . so you around for thanksgiving ?
uh , no , actually .
i , um ...
i &apos;ve been going through some ... some mixed feelings
for someone as well , so i called my grandfather ,
and i think i &apos;m gonna head out to the estate
and try and patch things up .
all right , well , tell him i said hello ,
and that thanks to last year &apos;s the longest yard ,
my knee can now predict the weather .
will do , man . peace .
hey . wanna go for a walk ?
hi . sorry . i got in a huge fight with my mom ,
and i didn &apos;t sign the form to stay in the dorm over break .
so could i crash with you for a while ?
what &apos;s with the face ?
oh . no . what ?
no , this is my , um , my surprised , happy face .
uh , make yourself at home .
lily told us you still weren &apos;t well enough to travel ,
so we thought video chat would , uh , be a great way
to have you at thanksgiving tomorrow .
i &apos;m fine .
lily told me you weren &apos;t doing anything for thanksgiving .
well , i @-@ i mean we &apos;re not doing anything major ,
but , uh , i &apos;m sure after everything you &apos;ve been through ,
she ... she didn &apos;t want to make you feel obligated .
oh , how , um , how thoughtful .
i &apos;d love to be there in person .
but let &apos;s keep it as a surprise , shall we ?
see you soon .
&quot; hello &quot; is the word you &apos;re looking for .
i am sorry , miss blair .
i not talking with vanya ,
and now he not stop calling and texting
and tweeting and writing on wall .
lionel tribbey ? that &apos;s my mother &apos;s estate attorney .
&quot; please approve all changes and return immediately . &quot;
she &apos;s changing her will . i knew there was a secret .
darling , i &apos;m home !
mother !
is that for me ?
yes . mm .
why don &apos;t we open it now ?
no , tea first .
i have the most amazing lapsang souchong
from mariage fries .
come on , serena .
you go off with tripp after leaving me in a bar ,
and then i hear through the van der bilt grapevine
that ... tripp &apos;s asking maureen for a divorce .
you expect me to believe that nothing happened ?
it was one kiss ,
and it was a huge mistake that i don &apos;t intend on repeating .
i promise .
fine .
can i call you back ?
i have to cancel on tomorrow .
maureen was a mess when she got here .
she kept asking if something else was going on .
she wants to have thanksgiving together .
i have to go .
sorry .
hey , do you have plans for thanksgiving ?
i know it &apos;s last minute .
no , i don &apos;t , actually .
well , how about 3 : 00 at my mom &apos;s ?
and please bring something stronger than rufus &apos; cider .
oh , nice coat .
oh , you , too . oh , my god .
maureen .
lily .
oh , i am so glad to see you . how is d.c. ?
so much to get ready ,
but tripp insisted we spend the holidays here .
speaking of , i &apos;d love to know why he has my daughter
working on thanksgiving .
she said she &apos;s volunteering at a soup kitchen with him .
i &apos;ve never seen her work these kinds of hours .
is it always like this with him ?
no . his schedule &apos;s been
especially busy these past few weeks .
this is probably an overstep ,
but do you think you could convince him
to spend part of your thanksgiving with us ,
you know , force my daughter to have a little family time ?
uh @-@ oh . looks like someone &apos;s &quot; small &quot; thanksgiving
might just have a big problem .
yes . yes , we &apos;d ... we &apos;d love to come .
great .
may the lord make us truly thankful
for what we are about to receive .
then she starts lecturing the poor cashier
that thanksgiving is nothing more
than a corporate agenda of the food industry masquerading as family sentiment .
oh , you know what that reminds me .
um , if my dad asks ,
we followed the homemade recipe for his pie crust to the letter .
sorry for unloading . i just haven &apos;t had anyone to vent to
since olivia left .
have you talked to her
since she went to do &quot; bitches of eastwick &quot; ?
uh , no .
hey , everything happens for a reason , right ?
yeah . yeah , apparently .
there it is again .
that face .
what ? oh , come on . there &apos;s , uh , there &apos;s no ... there &apos;s no face .
what is going on ? you &apos;ve been quiet ever since i got here .
who &apos;s that ?
don &apos;t ... don &apos;t hate me for this .
i &apos;m here .
i won &apos;t hate you , &apos; cause you &apos;ll be dead .
don &apos;t be mad at dan . he was just trying to help .
look , i know i don &apos;t do holidays well ,
but if you give me another chance ,
i promise i can make it up to you .
i called rufus on the way over here ,
and he said we &apos;re more than welcome to join him .
we can have the thanksgiving that you want .
what do you say ?
fine .
great . thank you .
make yourself at home .
i &apos;ll give her one last shot .
if it doesn &apos;t work , consider me moved in for the holidays .
tripp , what are you doing here ?
you wouldn &apos;t return my calls .
so you &apos;re stalking me now ?
yes , serena , i &apos;m stalking you .
i thought our relationship wasn &apos;t complicated enough ,
so ...
and get this ... lily ran into maureen
and invited us for thanksgiving ,
so it looks like we &apos;ll be spending tomorrow together after all .
what ? tripp , won &apos;t that be weird ?
it doesn &apos;t have to be .
and besides , now we get to spend some time together .
that &apos;s all i care about ... even with everyone else around ...
to be near you one last time .
i rush to intensive care
why does this have to be so hard ?
we &apos;re almost to your floor . you want me to come in ?
yes , which is why you can &apos;t .
if this is the last dance , i wanna know
i wanna know
but then again , these elevators can take forever .
baby
cyrus , enough .
yes , enough .
i will . i will tell her .
i will . all right . good @-@ bye .
cyrus says that he misses you and loves you .
blah , blah , blah , blah , blah .
sorry . i had to run out before store closes .
i bring babka and make decaf .
you have to be up early for flight .
no babka
dorota . i have to turn in now .
it &apos;s 3 : 00 in the morning for me .
i should sleep early , too .
i agreed to work at miss lily &apos;s tomorrow .
big thanksgiving for them , all the sudden ,
but she offer me time and a half , so ...
good night , dear .
wait ! i have a wonderful idea .
why don &apos;t we spend thanksgiving with lily and serena ?
what are you talking about ?
you know how much i love thanksgiving ,
the parade on tv .
i &apos;m 19 . childhood memories are slipping away already .
well , let me at least call lily ,
see if it &apos;s all right .
i am not getting on that plane
until i know my mother &apos;s secret ,
and her secret is in that envelope .
what are you clutching ?
uh , miss eleanor asked me to
pick up some things for paris
it &apos;s private .
you know what isn &apos;t ? the i.n.s. tip line .
oh , my god .
that &apos;s why she &apos;s changing her will ?
my mother &apos;s pregnant .
gratulacje .
i just came from a meeting with hotel security .
elevator cameras caught a hotel guest
pulling the emergency stop
to have a make @-@ out session with her boyfriend .
you just love your job , don &apos;t you ?
it was serena and tripp .
i guess he &apos;s not leaving maureen
over &quot; hudson hero . &quot;
though i bet that &apos;s what he &apos;s telling serena .
it &apos;s less messy that way ,
when he bolts in six months .
come on .
how often does the other woman
get a &quot; happily ever after &quot; ?
someone needs to get through to her before it &apos;s too late .
you know serena .
whoever tries better bring a sledgehammer .
security , please .
oh , dorota .
happy thanksgiving . when did you sneak in ?
i took service elevator .
oh , you don &apos;t have to do that .
vanya &apos;s on duty . i &apos;m sure he &apos;d love to see you .
mother .
surprise . surprise !
hello , lily .
this is the mystery guest ?
well , when rufus called
and found out that i was feeling well enough to travel ,
we thought we &apos;d surprise you .
how wonderful
opening the door is his job , mom .
that &apos;s why he &apos;s called the doorman .
it &apos;s not derogatory .
rufus
thank you again so much for inviting us .
uh , cece , this is gabriela abrams
and her daughter vanessa . this is cece , lily &apos;s mom .
lovely to see you . hello , daniel .
you &apos;re looking well , cece .
i am , aren &apos;t i ?
this table is exquisite .
well , lily , it looks like we , um , have a lot to talk about ,
as do you and rufus .
what &apos;s the matter , mother ?
is the smoked salmon making you nauseous ?
no . no , i &apos;m just a little jet @-@ lagged . that &apos;s all .
oh , charles , brut ros ? it &apos;s my favorite .
that &apos;s what blair said when she suggested i pick it up .
yes , mother , you simply must have some tonight .
i &apos;m not in the champagne mood .
but you love champagne .
i didn &apos;t say i didn &apos;t love it . i said i &apos;m not in the mood .
happy thanksgiving .
you , too . i was just telling tripp
what a pleasant surprise it was when i ran into lily .
we &apos;re really appreciate the invitation .
yes , especially since you and tripp
have been working all those long hours .
serena &apos;s been a great help .
you must be so proud . he has such a strong work ethic .
yes . that &apos;s him .
so where should i put my coat ?
here . let me take that .
thank you . um ...
there &apos;s nate . i should say hello .
the hardest part &apos;s over .
we &apos;ll get through this . okay ?
serena , my dear , happy thanksgiving .
thank you . i didn &apos;t know you guys were coming , either of you .
surprise . isn &apos;t this just the best holiday ?
hello , congressman . where &apos;s your lovely wife ?
is it me or is my daughter just getting crazier and crazier ?
a little thanksgiving proclamation ...
you two ever play grab ass in my elevator again ,
and serena will be staying at an airport marriott .
happy holidays .
are tripp and serena having an affair ?
nate , please . i don &apos;t want to hurt anyone .
i just want him back .
i &apos;m sorry , maureen .
but i think i have a way we can end it quickly and quietly .
i don &apos;t know if you want to see this .
if it will end it ... i do .
where are you dragging me ?
haven &apos;t you ever heard of a whispered aside ?
what did eric do at cotillion ?
what do you mean ?
i mean i invited jonathan for thanksgiving ,
and he texted me back , saying he was surprised
that eric and i were still even friends after that night .
please .
you , of all people , respect a well @-@ thought @-@ out sabotage .
although you came through unscathed ,
eric &apos;s plan was solid .
eric &apos;s plan ?
stealing your escort , leaving you stranded
at the top of the stairs ... it was all his idea .
by the way , how do you find having a sibling ,
someone whose sole purpose on earth is
to compete for your parents &apos; love and attention ?
if everyone could please find their seats ...
mm , whatcha say ?
mm , that you only meant well ?
well , of course you did
mm , whatcha say ?
i am so happy we are sitting next to each other , rufus .
excuse me .
cece , tell me
everything about rufus and lily &apos;s wedding .
i was boycotting the floral industry
or i would have been there myself .
tragically , i wasn &apos;t invited .
apparently my son @-@ in @-@ law felt it
better if i didn &apos;t attend .
rufus .
mom , it &apos;s none of your business .
you didn &apos;t want lily &apos;s own mother at your wedding ?
fifth wedding .
but still .
lily told me you were still too sick to travel .
thank you , but , i mean ,
i &apos;ve been in remission since the middle of august .
but lily didn &apos;t come home till october .
when the roof caved in and the truth came out ?
oh . perhaps i &apos;m ... i &apos;m ... i &apos;m wrong .
it &apos;s hard to keep track .
wine ?
we &apos;ll be living so large
i &apos;ll do anything for you
so tell me , girl . mm , whatcha say ?
why does my mom have to stick her nose
into everyone &apos;s business ?
oh , come on .
cece &apos;s heart pumps secrets and gin .
it &apos;s not ... it &apos;s not your mom &apos;s fault .
you &apos;ve been defending her all day and ignoring me .
what &apos;s going on with you ?
and you &apos;re making that face again .
no . all right ,
look , this is getting ridiculous .
jenny , have you ever heard of someone
starting to make a brand @-@ new face at 19 ?
i don &apos;t know . ask eric . he &apos;s mastered 2 .
excuse me ?
blair told me you were responsible
for sabotaging me at cotillion .
what , you don &apos;t have anything to say to me ?
your sweet potatoes are bland .
mm , whatcha say ?
mm , that you only meant well ? well , of course you did ?
mm , whatcha say ? whatcha say ? whatcha say ?
mm , that it &apos;s all for the best
because it is
mm , what you say ?
mm , that you only meant well ?
mother , here &apos;s some camembert from artisanal .
it &apos;s unpasteurized . don &apos;t you want some ?
that &apos;s enough . what has gotten into you ?
into me ?
try you . you &apos;re the one who &apos;s pregnant .
knowing that i let our love go
lily and i would like to thank you all
for coming to our first thanksgiving as a family .
now before she gets back , i &apos;d like to tell you a joke
that i tell every year , which lily has expressly forbidden .
a group of pilgrims decide to start a band ...
after several of the prominent elders ...
how can you two sit there , smiling ?
don &apos;t you have any sense of decency ?
maureen
no , not one second more .
the young pilgrim says , &quot; can i try ? &quot;
tripp and i are going to grow old together
without you .
or i make my own statement .
where did you get that ?
... blow them all away , in a ... in a style ...
he &apos;ll be a political joke
and you &apos;ll be a punch line .
your affair ends now .
when he &apos;s done , one of the older pilgrims says ...
serena .
and he says , &quot; that &apos;s what i call plymouth rock ! &quot;
&apos;cause things ain &apos;t right
? &apos; cause when the roof caved in and the truth came out ?
i just didn &apos;t know what to do
i just didn &apos;t know what to do
but when i become a star
we &apos;ll be living so large
you know what ? why don &apos;t we just eat ?
i lost my appetite .
baby , whatcha say ?
mm , whatcha say ? ?
and i want pie .
mm , that you only meant well ?
well , of course you did , mm , whatcha say ?
kids .
oh , and what makes you an expert ?
mm , whatcha say ?
mm , that you only meant well ? well , of course you did .
i &apos;m so glad you invited me , rufus .
cheers .
? what ... what ... what ... what did you say ? ?
mom , i can explain . it &apos;s not what it looks like .
so you &apos;re not having an affair with a married man ?
no , i &apos;m ... i &apos;m .. i &apos;m not having an affair .
i saw you kissing him , serena .
a kiss that we didn &apos;t even have
until after he decided to leave his wife .
do you know what it feels like to be left ? because i do .
well , it isn &apos;t like it was with you .
tripp actually cares about me .
oh , you think so ?
well , why don &apos;t you take a look at what he &apos;s doing ?
leaving someone who , up until today ,
thought the exact same thing .
walk away , serena .
until you do , you &apos;re not welcome in this home .
so i don &apos;t get it . you hate me
but you &apos;ve been pretending to be my friend
this entire time ?
that &apos;s pretty much it , yeah .
why wouldn &apos;t you just tell me you were mad ?
at least then we could fight about it .
no , you lost any rights to honesty
when you chose being queen over our friendship .
that &apos;s not what happened .
every time you did something bad ,
i defended you to jonathan .
he got sick of me
making excuses for you all the time ,
so i decided to try to beat you at your own game .
that was a mistake .
i figured if i could take you down just once
so you could know how it feels to be the one getting egged
then maybe you &apos;d realize what you &apos;d become ,
and everything could go back to the way it was .
but that didn &apos;t happen .
and you lost jonathan because of it .
i lost everything .
not me .
not if you apologize .
you say that now
but you &apos;ve become a totally different person ,
and as a result , so have i.
apparently i became
someone that jonathan no longer wanted to be with ,
and for that , i blame you .
you told kira she had to watch her back .
well , now you have to watch yours .
there you are .
mother , how could you ?
no offense to cyrus ,
but do you think the world really needs another aaron rose ?
blair , you are completely off base .
thanksgiving always has secrets .
and in your case , it &apos;s a miracle .
i am not pregnant .
i did come back to change my will to reflect my new property .
cyrus and i are moving to paris full time .
but you love new york .
you always said anyone who lives anywhere else
is fooling themselves .
perhaps it &apos;s time for me to step back
and let you make manhattan your own .
besides , cyrus and i did find a lovely penthouse flat
on the ile st. louis ,
right across from your favorite restaurant .
roisserie du beaujolais ?
mm .
oh , that poulet rute is reason enough to move .
mother ...
i &apos;m sorry
for being so crazy .
you pregnant ?
i mean , come on .
we both know you closed for business a long time ago .
but then whose test was it ?
test ?
miss waldorfs ...
i know dorota &apos;s upstairs .
she won &apos;t return my calls .
please , tell her whatever i did , i am sorry .
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
i &apos;ll be honest .
this isn &apos;t the thanksgiving i had hoped for .
look , i don &apos;t ... i don &apos;t mean to be presumptuous ,
but don &apos;t you think it &apos;s a little odd
that lily didn &apos;t tell you the truth
about when her mother went into remission ?
i trust lily . when she &apos;s ready to explain , she will .
yes . yes , but ...
you know , i think i need more whipped cream .
what is wrong with you ?
i care about rufus . i was being honest .
just like you being honest when i laid out my entire paycheck
to get us tickets to see &quot; hair , &quot; and you told me
you &apos;d rather spend the whole show talking
to a homeless man ?
he was a vet .
this is who i am .
i care about people .
you know , um , it &apos;s thanksgiving .
yeah . i &apos;m starting to think this was a mistake .
maybe i should go .
for once , mom , i agree .
gabriela ... mm .
i &apos;m sorry .
i could only imagine what you &apos;re feeling .
what we did ... what i did was wrong .
i never meant to hurt anyone ,
and ... and i hurt you .
i promise i &apos;ll never see tripp again .
what are you doing in here ?
i wanted to go to my room ,
but then i forgot it &apos;s not my room anymore .
what do you want ?
chuck told me what happened . you did the right thing .
then why do i feel so bad ?
doing the right thing takes courage and strength .
at least , that &apos;s what i &apos;ve heard .
and anything that hard is only made more difficult
by not having your best friend by your side .
i &apos;m sorry you had to go through it alone .
i &apos;m sorry , too ,
for everything .
what are you doing this weekend ?
eating leftovers and feeling horrible .
no , you &apos;re coming to paris .
what ? i am ?
my mom and i are catching the red @-@ eye tonight .
if you &apos;re gonna be sad , you might as well be sad in paris .
chuck can shop for sweaters with harold and roman ,
and we can wander notre dame , and spend time ,
just the two of us , like we haven &apos;t for so long .
is your passport here ?
in the safe upstairs .
then you &apos;re ready to go !
come on . allons @-@ y .
oh . i &apos;m sorry . i missed thanksgiving .
there &apos;s still dessert .
you &apos;re wonderful .
why did you stay with cece after she got better
instead of coming home to me ?
well , um , my mother and i were finally connecting .
i think , faced with her illness ,
she ... she became a different person . she was loving and kind .
and i wanted to stay and enjoy this person
for as long as i could .
you could have told me that .
i know , and i should have , but i ...
i knew it was selfish
leaving you here , in charge of the kids and everything ,
and , um , so i lied .
and then i just continued to lie to cover it up .
so that &apos;s it then ?
you love me so much you couldn &apos;t let me go ?
well , you weren &apos;t supposed to hear that , mother .
i &apos;m glad i did .
i now have a witness
if she ever tries to tell me how insufferable i am .
i &apos;m gonna go clear the table .
thank you , mother .
so i take it you didn &apos;t tell him
about your little trip this summer ?
no , and i &apos;d like to keep it that way .
when will you learn , my love ,
that some secrets can &apos;t stay hidden ?
well , this one will .

i @-@ i don &apos;t want to do this !
well , i guess it &apos;s a good thing you travel light .
look , i @-@ i appreciate your concern , dan .
i do , but it &apos;s a waste of time . we &apos;re ... we &apos;re too far apart .
well , y @-@ you &apos;re not as different as you think .
did you know she petitioned to keep a historic bar
from closing in brooklyn last year ?
and she spent the end of the summer
rebuilding community gardens in alphabet city .
she loves you . she does . i think she just wishes
you &apos;d spend half the time on her
that you do on these people you don &apos;t even know .
and when you do , trust me , i @-@ i really think you &apos;ll see
how , uh , how amazing she is .
i ... i can &apos;t believe i didn &apos;t see this till now .
mm , what ?
oh , you &apos;re in love with her .
it &apos;s all over your face .
no . that &apos;s , um ...
i &apos;ll , uh , i &apos;ll let you guys be alone .
i can &apos;t believe what you did .
you had a choice , tripp .
seems like you made it .
what do you mean ?
now thanks to you , maureen can cause a huge scandal .
i lose everything .
no , you lose your career .
tripp , you &apos;ve already lost serena .
the fact that this is just now occurring to you
makes me pretty sure i did the right thing .
why didn &apos;t you tell him the truth ?
that is the truth . okay , serena deserves
someone who would sacrifice anything to be with her .
even if that means stealing a security tape
from his best friend &apos;s business ?
tell her how you feel .
give her a chance
to be with a guy who does deserve her .
gibson guitar ,
vinyl collection ...
i guess this really isn &apos;t bart &apos;s office anymore .
yeah , except i &apos;m sure my mom
hasn &apos;t given rufus the combo to the safe yet .
well , now that bart &apos;s not around to keep files on everybody ,
maybe you guys don &apos;t need one .
what are you still doing here ?
i couldn &apos;t leave .
i could help you out with that . the elevator comes ,
you get on it , and we never see you again .
i don &apos;t care if maureen outs our affair .
i don &apos;t care if they run me out of congress for it .
all i care about ... is you . if i &apos;m gonna leave maureen ,
which ... i just told her i am ...
i want to do it with you by my side .
i &apos;m gonna be downstairs , waiting in my car , to go .
i hope you &apos;ll join me .
wow . i didn &apos;t think he had it in him .
what do i do ?
go .
i love you .
i love you , too .
what is that ?
it &apos;s from my father .
it &apos;s postmarked from weeks ago , and it &apos;s been opened .
blair , we have to go .
go . it &apos;s okay . i need to be alone .
where are you going ? tripp and his wife have left ,
and you , um , you did the right thing .
actually , tripp is divorcing maureen .
he &apos;s waiting for me downstairs . we &apos;re going away together .
i thought we understood each other , serena .
we do . i &apos;m not welcome in your home , so ...
you &apos;re still responsible for breaking up his marriage .
don &apos;t go through with this . it is a huge mistake ,
one that you will regret for the rest of your life .
you want to talk to me about mistakes ?
you don &apos;t get to judge me ...
ever again .
after the yelling died down , i thought i &apos;d take a chance
you might be ready for some pie and coffee .
well , my daughter and i had
our first hear @-@ to @-@ heart talk in ... in ever .
and thank you .
of course . it &apos;s all because of you . but don &apos;t worry .
we &apos;re gonna move to a hotel for the rest of the
weekend .
oh , you ... you don &apos;t have to leave .
i mean , you &apos;re welcome to stay , uh , as long as you like .
okay .
about what i said before ...
you gave me some great advice . i &apos;m going to return the favor .
when vanessa told you her feelings all those years ago ,
you broke her heart ,
and your friendship almost didn &apos;t recover .
so unless you &apos;re sure
that my daughter is who you want to be with ,
i suggest you keep your feelings to yourself .
because if you break her heart this time ,
your friendship won &apos;t survive .
and that would be a tragedy ,
because you are a great friend for her .
thank you .
hey , mom . paul hoffman , that guy that i told you about ...
he just texted me , and his parents are in town .
he wants to meet for a drink . do you want to go ?
i don &apos;t know . dan , do i ?
uh , yeah . yeah , yeah . i ... she likes him a lot .
i think you should meet him .
great .
all right . let &apos;s do it .
serena !
excuse me if i didn &apos;t say good @-@ bye ,
but after what you did ...
don &apos;t go .
what ?
don &apos;t go with tripp .
nate .
okay , i know what i did was wrong ,
and i &apos;m sorry . i just ... i did it because ...
&apos;cause ever since last week ,
ever since three years ago when you left ...
please don &apos;t get in the car .
just stay here with me .
just give me a chance .
serena .
you coming ?
you &apos;ll come visit us in vermont ?
i will .
thanks for everything .
another thanksgiving has come and gone ...
you know what ?
i like your new face .
it &apos;s cute .
and what am i most thankful for ?
the truth .
sometimes it &apos;s the truth you &apos;ve been trying not to face
or the truth that will change your life ...
and we &apos;ve got to find other ways
to make it alone
keep a straight face
and i &apos;ve always lived like this
keeping a comfortable ...
sometimes it &apos;s the truth that &apos;s a long time coming ...
jenny knows . we have to strike now .
and up until now i had sworn to myself
* that i &apos;m content *
or the truth you prayed would never see the light of day .
lil ?
lily , have you seen the other wedding album ?
i want to show cece the pictures
of me jamming with kim and thurston .
you okay ?
oh , yes , everything &apos;s fine . um , i &apos;ll grab it .
you are the only exception
hey , do you mind if i stay ?
yes .
but that &apos;s why i love you .
come on .
let &apos;s go get drunk .
some truths may not be heard the way
we hoped they would .
but they linger long after they &apos;ve been said .
leave me with some kind of proof it &apos;s not a dream
you are the only exception
you are the only exception
oh , i didn &apos;t see you , miss van der bilt .
sorry , dorota . i forgot my coat .
it &apos;s been kind of a crazy night .
please tell lily and rufus everything was wonderful .
and i &apos;m on my way to believing
but the kind of truth i &apos;m most thankful for ...
the one you never see coming that falls right into your lap .
