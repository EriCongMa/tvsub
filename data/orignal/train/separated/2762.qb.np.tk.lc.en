you barge in here and you don &apos;t knock ?
you have no respect for privacy .
no , you wait !
can i just say one thing ?
what ? !
that &apos;s a relatively open weave . i can still see ...
... your nippular areas .
the one with the boobies
honey , tell them the story about your patient ...
... who thinks things are other things .
when the phone rings and she takes a shower .
that &apos;s pretty much it .
but you tell it really well , sweetie .
thanks . okay .
now go away so we can talk about you .
okay . i &apos;ll miss you .
lsn &apos;t he great ?
he &apos;s cute . he likes you so much .
i know . he &apos;s so sweet . and so complicated , you know ?
and for a shrink , he &apos;s not too shrinky .
think you &apos;ll do it on his couch ?
i don &apos;t know . that &apos;s a little weird .
it &apos;s vinyl .
okay , you guys want anything else ?
could i have ?
we &apos;re all out . anybody else ?
did i miss something ?
no , she &apos;s still upset because i saw her boobies .
what were you doing seeing her boobies ?
it was an accident . i wasn &apos;t across the street with a telescope .
can we change the subject , please ?
these aren &apos;t her &quot; boobies . &quot; these are her breasts .
pheebs , i was hoping for more of a change .
i always liked &quot; bazoombas . &quot;
gives them a latin spin .
can we drop this already , please ?
why are you embarrassed ? they were very nice boobies .
&quot; nice &quot; ? they were &quot; nice &quot; ?
that &apos;s it ? i mean , mittens are &quot; nice . &quot;
okay . rock , hard place . me .
you &apos;re so funny !
he &apos;s really funny .
i wouldn &apos;t wanna be there when the laughter stops .
whoa , back up there , sparky .
what did you mean by that ?
it seems that maybe you have intimacy issues ...
... that you use your humor to keep people at a distance .
i mean , i just met you . i don &apos;t know you from adam .
only child , right ?
parents divorced before you hit puberty .
how did you know that ?
it &apos;s textbook .
hey , you guys . you all know my dad , right ?
how long are you in the city ?
two days . i got a job .
i &apos;m better off staying with joey ...
... than going back and forth on the ferry .
i don &apos;t know this one .
this is my friend roger .
good to meet you .
you too .
what happened to the puppet guy ?
dad .
oh , excuse me . so , ross , how &apos;s the wife ?
0 for 2 , huh ?
chandler , say something funny .
i gotta go . miss you too .
i love you , but it &apos;s getting late
say hi . hey , ma .
i made the appointment with dr. bassida and
excuse me ?
did you know this isn &apos;t ma ?
her name &apos;s ronni .
she &apos;s a pet mortician .
sure .
so , how long you been ... ?
remember when you were a kid , i &apos;d take you to the navy yard ?
since then ?
no , it &apos;s only been six years .
i wanted you to think of a nice memory so you &apos;d know i &apos;m not a terrible guy .
what are you doing ?
chopping garlic .
you don &apos;t crush it ?
you &apos;re having an affair , i chop garlic . it &apos;s a wacky world .
joe , you ever been in love ?
i don &apos;t know .
then you haven &apos;t .
you &apos;re burning tomatoes .
you &apos;re one to talk .
your dad &apos;s in love . the worst part is , it &apos;s with two different women .
oh , man ! please tell me one of them is ma .
of course one of them &apos;s ma . what &apos;s the matter with you ?
it &apos;s like if you woke up and found out ...
... your dad leads this double life .
he &apos;s like actually some spy working for the cla .
that &apos;d be cool .
this blows !
do you think dad cheated ?
i don &apos;t think so . that would involve sex .
i &apos;d like to think that our parents don &apos;t do that .
i know . why can &apos;t parents just stay parents ?
why do they have to become people ? why do they have ?
why ...
... can &apos;t you stop staring at my breasts ?
what ?
what ?
didn &apos;t you get a good enough look ?
we &apos;re all adults here . there &apos;s only one way to resolve this .
since you saw her boobies you have to show her your pee @-@ pee .
you know , i don &apos;t see that happening .
come on . he &apos;s right . tit for tat .
well , i &apos;m not showing you my tat !
it &apos;s phoebe .
and rog !
come on up .
oh , good ! rog is here .
what &apos;s the matter with rog ?
it &apos;s a little thing . i hate that guy !
so he was a little analytical . that &apos;s what he does .
come on , he &apos;s not that bad .
you &apos;re wrong ! why would i marry her ...
... if i thought that she was a lesbian ?
i don &apos;t know . maybe you wanted your marriage to fail .
why ? why would l ? why ?
i don &apos;t know . maybe low self @-@ esteem ?
maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling . maybe
wait ! go back to that &quot; sibling &quot; thing .
well , i don &apos;t know .
you could &apos;ve sabotaged your marriage ...
... so the sibling would feel like less of a failure .
that &apos;s ridiculous ! i don &apos;t feel guilty for her failures .
you think i &apos;m a failure ?
lsn &apos;t he good ?
yeah . no , that &apos;s not what i was saying .
i thought you were on my side .
but maybe you sucked up to them so they &apos;d favor you .
i married a lesbian to make you look good !
you &apos;re right . i mean , you &apos;re right .
it wasn &apos;t just the weebles , but the weeble play palace ...
... and the weeble &apos;s cruise ship ...
... with this lifeboat for the weebles to wobble in .
and mom just gave them all away .
that &apos;s tough , tough stuff .
pheebs , we &apos;re gonna catch that movie , we gotta go .
feel better .
we &apos;re gonna be late , sweetie .
thanks for everything , mon .
no problem .
listen , it was great seeing you again .
mon , easy on those cookies , okay ?
remember , they &apos;re just food , they &apos;re not love .
i hate that guy !
good night , you guys .
oh , look . it &apos;s the woman we ordered .
hey , can we help you ?
no , thanks . i &apos;m just waiting for joey tribbiani .
i &apos;m joey tribbiani .
oh , no , not you . big joey . oh , my god !
you &apos;re so much cuter than your pictures .
i &apos;m ronni .
cheese nip ?
joey &apos;s having an embolism , but i &apos;d go for a nip .
most people , when their pets pass on ...
... want them like they &apos;re sleeping .
occasionally you get a person who wants them in a pose .
like chasing their tail .
or jumping to catch a frisbee .
joey , if i go first , i wanna be looking for my keys .
that &apos;s a good one !
hey .
hey , dad . ronni &apos;s here .
hi .
hey .

oh , you left your hair at my place .
i thought you &apos;d need it tomorrow .

if you go to a hotel , you &apos;ll be doing stuff .
i want you here so i can keep an eye on you .
you &apos;re gonna keep an eye on us ?

as long as you are under my roof ...
... you &apos;re gonna live by my rules .
that means no sleeping with your girlfriend .

well , you &apos;re gonna .
i was thinking about how i &apos;m always seeing girls on top of girls ....
are they end @-@ to @-@ end , or tall , like pancakes ?
you know , how i date all these women .
i always figured , when the right one comes along ...
... i &apos;ll be able to go the distance .
now i &apos;m looking at my dad , thinking
you &apos;re not him , you &apos;re you .
when they wanted you in your father &apos;s business , did you cave ?
no .
no .
you chose the out @-@ of @-@ work @-@ actor business .
that wasn &apos;t easy , but you did it .
i believe when the right woman comes along ...
... you &apos;ll have the guts to say , &quot; no , thanks , i &apos;m married . &quot;
you really think so ?
yeah , i really do .
thanks , chandler .

hey , good morning , dear .
chandler bing , it &apos;s time to see your thing .
what &apos;s with you ?
i thought it was chandler !
you were supposed to be in there so i &apos;d see your thing !
sorry , my thing was in there with me .
how &apos;s it going ?
good .
roger &apos;s having a dinner thing . he wanted me to invite you guys .
so , what &apos;s going on ?
nothing .
it &apos;s just ....
it &apos;s roger , you know ?
there &apos;s something about
we just feel that he &apos;s ....
we hate that guy !
we hate him !
we &apos;re sorry , pheebs .
okay .
don &apos;t you think it &apos;s just that he &apos;s so perceptive ...
... it freaked you out ?
no , we hate him !
i &apos;m sorry .
ma ! what are you doing here ?
i came to give you this and this !
big ring !
why &apos;d you fill your father &apos;s head with garbage ...
... about making things right ?
things were fine this way !
there &apos;s chicken in there . put it away .
for god &apos;s sake , joey ! really .
hold on . you knew ?
of course i knew . what do you think ?
your father is no james bond .
you should &apos;ve heard his stories .
&quot; i &apos;m sleeping over at my accountant &apos;s . &quot;
what is that ? please !
so then , how could you ?
do you remember how your father used to be ?
always yelling . nothing made him happy .
not that wood shop , not those stupid little ships in the bottle .
now he &apos;s happy . i mean , it &apos;s nice . he has a hobby .
ma , i don &apos;t mean to be disrespectful ...
... but what the hell are you talking about ?
i mean , what about you ?
me ? i &apos;m fine .
look , honey , in an ideal world ...
... there &apos;d be no her and your father would look like sting .
and something else :
ever since that poodle @-@ stuffer came along ...
... he &apos;s so ashamed of himself that he &apos;s been more attentive .
he &apos;s been more loving . it &apos;s like every day is our anniversary .
i &apos;m happy for you ?
well , don &apos;t be !
now everything &apos;s screwed up .
i just want it the way it was .
ma , i &apos;m sorry .
i just did what i thought you &apos;d want .
i know you did , cookie . i know you did .
so tell me . did you see her ?
yeah .
you &apos;re 10 times prettier than she is .
that &apos;s sweet .
could i take her ?
with this ring , no contest .
oh , no ! don &apos;t ever do that !
what ?
i &apos;m sorry .
i have a thing , which means you can &apos;t ever do that !
what &apos;s wrong , sweetie ?
nothing .
no , what &apos;s wrong ? come on .
okay .
it &apos;s nothing . i &apos;m fine . it &apos;s just it &apos;s my friends .
they have a liking problem with you ...
... in that they don &apos;t .
they don &apos;t ?
but they don &apos;t see all the wonderfulness that i see .
they don &apos;t see all the good and sweet stuff .
they think you &apos;re a little
what ?
intense and creepy .
oh .
but i don &apos;t . me , phoebe .
i &apos;m not at all surprised about that .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re so great .
it &apos;s quite typical behavior ...
... when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic .
you know , this kind of codependent , emotionally stunted ...
... sitting in your stupid coffeehouse , with your stupid big cups ...
... which might as well have nipples on them .
and you &apos;re all like , &quot; oh , define me ! define me !
love me ! i need love !
you talked to your dad ?
he &apos;s gonna keep cheating on ma like she wanted .
ma will keep pretending she doesn &apos;t know .
and my sister , tina , can &apos;t see her husband .
he got a restraining order .
which has nothing to do with it . i found out today .
things have changed here on waltons &apos;mountain .
so , joey , are you okay ?
yeah , i guess .
it &apos;s just you know , they &apos;re parents .
after a certain point , you gotta let go .
you gotta let them make their own mistakes .
and think , in a few years , we &apos;ll turn into them .
oh , please .
if i turn into my parents , i &apos;ll be an alcoholic blond chasing men ...
... or i &apos;ll end up like my mom !
hey .
hey , pheebs .
how &apos;s it going ?
okay , except i broke up with roger .
yeah , right .
no , no , really .
what happened ?
i don &apos;t know . i mean ...
... he &apos;s a good person , and he can be really sweet .
in some ways , i think he is so right for me .
it &apos;s just .... i hate that guy !
hi , joey . what &apos;s going on ?
clear the tracks for the boobie payback .
next stop , rachel greene .
joey , what the hell were you doing ?
sorry , wrong boobies !
hello , joey !
