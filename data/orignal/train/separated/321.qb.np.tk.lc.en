oh , you want her to bring it ?
maybe clear your calendar .
uh , the lady in the booth doesn &apos;t like my attitude and wants you ,
so i guess what i &apos;m saying is
i still got it !

oleg , this is supposed to have extra croutons .
it &apos;s for my regular .
yeah , you heard me . it happened .
oh , no , &quot; extra croutons &quot; is here again ?
make sure you charge her extra .
i &apos;m not made of stale bread !
no , you &apos;re made of legos , right ?
we are not charging her extra .
she looks like she can &apos;t afford it .
if she could , why would she be eating here ?
well , don &apos;t judge a book by its cover .
people look at me and--
think you &apos;re bad in bed ?
what &apos;s your point ?
for your information , max , i &apos;m not bad in bed .
in fact , i &apos;m quite the stud in my sims community .
you wouldn &apos;t be a stud in a retirement community .
hi ! here &apos;s your salad ...
uh ... five , six , seven , eight , nine , ten .
uh , continue .
and i wanted to introduce myself .
i &apos;m caroline , you &apos;re regular waitress .
oh ! my turn . sorry .
i live alone , and my plants aren &apos;t this needy .
i &apos;m nola .
and this is max . max , this is nola .
&apos;sup , lola ?
it &apos;s nola .
see , this is why i like the blonde one .
she listens .
may i please have a cheesecake ?
sure . and thank you , nola .
i think it &apos;s important to listen to people .
coming right back with that cherry pie .
i &apos;ll tell her if she ever stops listening .
i think nola knows i &apos;m more than just a waitress .
she can see right through this uniform .
and so can i ... in just the right light .
close the door !
oh , my god !
sophie , you scared me !
you &apos;re scared ?
i just saw the expiration date on this milk !
come on , close it , quick !
i &apos;m in here hiding from oleg .
if you wanna get away from oleg ,
just go anywhere they sell floss .
i think that oleg is cheating on me .
look .
oh , god !
now she &apos;s gonna start whipping it out ?
look ...
he has a second secret phone .
it &apos;s a boner phone .
you mean a burner phone .
same thing .
sophie , how do you know
he just doesn &apos;t use it for long distance or ...
or for the woman that i &apos;m calling right now ?
oh , put her on speaker .
i &apos;ve nothing else to do . i &apos;m at work .
da ? oleg ?
oleg ?
that ... is a terrible oleg .
he is not that articulate .
hah ! that old whore !
what did she say ?
i have no idea !
i don &apos;t speak russian , but ...
i do speak &quot; old whore . &quot;
tell me , what is his problem ?
he has a sweet , young filly like me at home
and he needs to go out
and plow some old russian field ?
well ... i &apos;d ask what you three are doing in here ,
but it &apos;s never gonna top
what i &apos;m imagining you &apos;re doing in here .
i can &apos;t believe nola didn &apos;t come in tonight .
this is exactly what happened with my starbucks barista guy .
one minute , he &apos;s suggestively arranging the bananas at me ,
and then next minute , he &apos;s face @-@ down ,
dead in a puddle of soy milk .
max , what if something happened to her ?
more croutons for us !
she said , &quot; i &apos;ll see you tomorrow . &quot;
that doesn &apos;t mean anything . it &apos;s just an expression like ,
&quot; employees must wash hands . &quot;
or ... or , &quot; the baby is yours . &quot;
hey , everybody !
oh , sophie , it &apos;s just you .
you &apos;re poor !
and now we &apos;re even .
look , i stole it again . where &apos;s oleg ?
i &apos;ll tell you where he &apos;s not--
culinary school .
he &apos;s on break .
oh , she &apos;s gonna be sorry !
oh ... no one comes between sophie and her man .
you know ... unless we pay them to .
couple things--
a--does anyone ever work here ?
caroline , stop worrying . extra croutons is fine .
she just called to order some diner food to be delivered .
oh ! so she wants to die at home .
i said we don &apos;t do deliveries .
i told her you two can barely get the food
from the window to the tables !
max , i had to stop by
and bring nola her salad and croutons .
i mean , she &apos;s kind of my biggest fan right now .
true ... &apos; cause you just lost me .
i know you think this is crazy ,
but there &apos;s something about the way nola looks at me .
it &apos;s like she &apos;s seeing something in me .
the woman wears two pairs of glasses .
to her , you &apos;re just a chatty yellow and orange blur .
i was told you didn &apos;t deliver .
by who , her old boy friends ?
are you two gonna kill me or something ?
because if you are ,
i would like to put on a different hat .
no , no , no . she got worried .
see , you &apos;re her first regular .
i &apos;m just here for the story .
i figured there &apos;d be something freaky behind this door
like a 50 @-@ foot python and what &apos;s left of the ups guy .
and earl guessed you were a man .
no man .
no , just me in here with my vagina and my photographs .
oh ! you &apos;re a photographer ?
i love photography !
and i love privacy .
and i love pot .
oh , i thought we were going around .
come on . you better come in too .
you &apos;re the yin to her yap .
hey , careful where you step .
i can &apos;t find my third pair of glasses .
it &apos;s on top of your hat .
no , that &apos;s my fourth pair .
this is billy the bum !
he used to live in a box around the corner from my apartment .
he even let me stay over once
when i had to get away from this bad roommate .
oh , the one before me ?
no , it was you .
you two are a riot together .
you remind me of me and my old photographer friend
annie leibovitz .
如约翰 · 列侬与小野洋子的知名 《 滚石 》 封面照
course , this was before ...
before she got famous ?
no . before she hit on me .
i told her i wasn &apos;t into girls .
but ... i think she was confused by the derby .
yeah . i think we &apos;re all a little confused by it .
nola , i want to ask you if you &apos;ve ever had any success ,
but i don &apos;t know how to do that without insulting you .
that &apos;s correct . you don &apos;t .
oh ! you &apos;re having a gallery show in soho ?
good @-@ bye .
uh , it was nice of you two
to , uh , come over , check on me .
uh ... weird , but nice .
perhaps we could come to the opening .
oh . oh , you don &apos;t need to do that .
i know we don &apos;t need to ,
but maybe i want to support you and your amazing work .
and max would enjoy . the free wine .
yes , i would .
no .
oh , i would .
no as in , &quot; no , don &apos;t come . &quot;
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
i wanna eat my croutons
without the vaudeville stylings
of shecky and nosy .
here .
oh , yeah , good . i was looking for this .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re doing all this for a diner regular .
i haven &apos;t seen you this desperate since monday ,
tuesday , wednesday , thursday , and friday .
i know--on the weekends , i just give up .
look that title !
&quot; the great unwashed . &quot;
are oleg &apos;s balls here ?
max , it &apos;s the &quot; art scene . &quot;
class it up . at least say testicles .
evening , ladies .
earl , what are you doing here ?
and , han , your sweater &apos;s eating your head .
i &apos;m here for the champagne
and because i couldn &apos;t find my way out .
i just walked into a picture of a door .
some of these are going for thousands of dollars !
that nola bitch is rich , and i bet she has
a frigging summer house made out of my free croutons !
han , it &apos;s the art scene . class it up .
at least say &quot; freaking . &quot; also , &quot; testicles . &quot;
well , i &apos;m not wasting this new turtleneck on you two .
i &apos;m going to go mingle .
a high fashion model was giving me the eye .
then she &apos;d have to be high .
uh , han , i believe i &apos;ll stay here .
nobody wins with a teenage mutant ninja turtle
as a wingman .
oh , hey , everybody .
hey , sophie . hey , oleg .
so can i class it back down now ?
sorry we &apos;re late . i was just over there
admiring the photo of the happy couple under the bridge .
happy couple ?
sophie , they &apos;re two junkies sharing a needle .
yeah , well , at least the lady junkie
knows where his needle &apos;s been .
i don &apos;t even think she knows her name .
well , she knows more than she &apos;s letting on .
she knows everything .
hey , you guys have been here a while .
where &apos;s the best place to steal some food ?
max !
sorry , sorry .
classing it up : testicles some food ?
oh , max , i can tell by your sassy demeanor
you haven &apos;t seen your photo yet .
what photo ? i haven &apos;t bounced any checks here .
yep , that &apos;s me , all right .
i recognize that &quot; i don &apos;t care &quot; pout
and the thousand island dressing in my hair .
max , just because you &apos;re hanging on a wall
among the poorest , most lost souls in our city
doesn &apos;t mean that your life is ...
i &apos;m hanging right behind me , aren &apos;t i ?
oh , my god !
it could be worse . you could be naked .
this is worse than being naked !
i &apos;m wearing polyester !
it &apos;s bad enough i &apos;m a waitress in brooklyn .
now i &apos;m a waitress in manhattan ,
and these guys didn &apos;t even tip !
no , no , no , it &apos;s a photograph ,
so it &apos;s more symbolic .
it &apos;s called &quot; waitress &quot;
and i &apos;m holding a check pad .
what do all these blue dots mean ?
is my picture in trouble ?
that &apos;s how many times your print has been purchased .
over here , max , away from that
pathetic blonde lady in the waitress uniform .
will you relax ? no one even recognized you .
no one ? what about that art critic who said that
&quot; my smile on the photo
was a study of tragic , foolish optimism
in a hopeless , dead @-@ end life &quot; ?
oh , him .
&quot; hopeless , dead @-@ end life &quot; ?
and then worse , no one buys me ?
i &apos;m not even a success as a failure ?
you &apos;re totally a success as a failure .
then where are all the blue dots , max ?
15 people bought you .
whatever you do , don &apos;t turn around .
look at these dots !
i am going home with all these people--
men , women , black , white .
it &apos;s like a key party at joe namath &apos;s house in the &apos; 70s .
hey , shecky !
why are you putting a dot by your friend &apos;s photo ?
uh , how many extra croutons can you buy
with the buttload of money you &apos;re making from these photos ?
a buttload .
okay , okay . i get it , you &apos;re mad .
tell you what .
i will give you a free print of your photo .
look , keep the photo .
i don &apos;t want a picture of me marrying ketchups .
i don &apos;t want a picture of me marrying anybody .
but you can pay me back another way .
i told you , i &apos;m not a lesbian .
i just wear hats .
your friend says you hate your photo .
no .
i enjoy being secretly photographed
while i &apos;m stealing someone extra , extra croutons .
for the record ,
i never saw your smile as foolish .
i saw it as , uh ...
just a little big .
uh--i &apos;m trying to pay you a compliment .
well , you failed .
all this time , when you looked at me ,
i thought you saw something special ,
but all you really saw was someone reading the specials .
i have a question for you .
okay , fine . i wear the derby
because i have a little bit of a bald spot .
why didn &apos;t i sell ?
the picture sucks .
one of my worst .
if you &apos;re still trying to give me a compliment ,
you &apos;re still failing .
look , a good photograph captures the truth .
and i guess no one really believes
you as a waitress .
that is the single nicest thing anyone &apos;s ever said to me .
so it &apos;s not where you wanna be--i get it .
look , it &apos;s taken me 50 years to be where i am .
and you are still so young .
that is the second @-@ nicest thing anyone &apos;s ever said to me !
the road is long , and trust me ,
it can be really hard .
so whatever you do ,
you hold on to that foolishly hopeful smile .
and ... your funny friend .
yes ?
yes .
uh , everyone , tonight we are witness
to the amazing work
of nola anderz .
why don &apos;t we all just stand here quietly for a moment
and let nola &apos;s pictures speak .
that &apos;s my phone . where is it ?
baby , why is my phone in your bra ?
shh , please !
it &apos;s your secret phone ! i know all about it .
you took it ? give it to me .
who is she , oleg ? who is this skanky old whore ?
security ! security !
what--no , no , no ! stop , stop--she has my phone .
it &apos;s his boner phone , everybody !
it &apos;s his boner phone !
and you had the testicles to think
i was gonna embarrass you .
hey , sophie .
hey , girls .
did you hear that ?
it sounds a little bit like ... i don &apos;t know .
the sound of cheating .
you guys haven &apos;t made up yet ?
don &apos;t make up here .
no . i slept on the couch .
i missed her so much , i watched a romcom
while eating a whole box of her edible underwear .
still not talking to me , sophie ?
for the last time , there &apos;s nobody else but you .
i use that phone ...
yes ?
to ...
go on .
i use it to call ...
cut to the chase !
my mother .
is there no one he won &apos;t sleep with ?
i didn &apos;t tell you because
i didn &apos;t want you to think i was a mama &apos;s boy .
except when we play &quot; mama and boy . &quot;
well ...
i &apos;ll tell you what i told that girl
at the yankee candle store .
&quot; i &apos;m not buyin &apos; it ! &quot;
it &apos;s true , sophie .
i &apos;m afraid i &apos;m ... losing my hair .
oh ... oleg .
but don &apos;t you know ...
i mean , you could be balder than
jeremy piven was 15 years ago ,
and i &apos;d still love ya .
where &apos;s my--
busted .
caroline , i have something for you .
i &apos;m not signing another one of those
giant birthday cards again .
it &apos;s my picture .
great . now i have two of you that don &apos;t wait on tables .
&quot; thanks for the croutons . nola . &quot;
max , where are we gonna hang me ?
maybe you should hang yourself in the bathroom
like i thought you would three years ago .
yep . i lost $ 20 on that bet .
you know , max ,
maybe i have to stop running away from this part of my life
and embrace it ,
see it as part of my journey ,
my ... beautiful , exciting journey .
if you don &apos;t shut up , i &apos;m gonna hang you right here .
