what &apos;s all this ? i said one suitcase .
i need choices , jay .
colombia &apos;s not one of your more formal nations .
the guy on their money is sitting in a lawn chair .
ay . i cannot believe that my little baby &apos;s leaving me .
you know , i left the glass doors open downstairs .
so right now , your actual baby may be leaving you .
one robe .
i guess we know what everyone
will be talking about my second morning there .
manny is visiting gloria &apos;s family for about a month , i hope .
i just gotta get him on a plane before
gloria has a meltdown and changes her mind .
&apos;cause if he doesn &apos;t go to colombia ,
colombia comes to me .
it happended before .
oh , my god .
oh , my god !
what ? !
oh ! it &apos;s mitchell . we won .
ay , that &apos;s great ! what we won ?
it &apos;s fantastic . we &apos;ve waited so long .
what did we won ? !
the supreme court ruling . gay marriage is legal .
ay ! congratulations !
thanks , gloria .
can i talk to cam ?
uh , yes . hold on .
thank you . thank you . yeah , it &apos;s mitchell .
hi . hey .
i gotta go . but can you believe this finally happened ?
i know . it &apos;s amazing . we &apos;ll celebrate tonight .
i love you .
celebrate what ?
oh . well , jay , hold on to your hat .
but as of today in california ,
it &apos;s legal for a man to marry another man !
ew . he threw up .
he just needs some time to get used to the idea , honey .
it &apos;s so great , cam .
yeah , i &apos;m happy for you guys .
gloria , manny needs his birth certificate
to re @-@ enter the country .
any idea where it is ?
i don &apos;t know .
oh , that &apos;s right . he leaves today . you must be a wreck .
she &apos;s not a wreck . she &apos;s a rock .
now , i looked , and it &apos;s not in the safe .
this one had her first sleepover last week .
i just had to tough my way through it .
he picked me up in the dark .
i can &apos;t find that birth certificate anywhere , jay .
maybe it &apos;s a sign and --
it &apos;s a sign we need a refresher meeting
on what goes in the safe .
here &apos;s a preview -- no shoes .
look , i looked online ,
and we can get a copy if we go to the courthouse .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re gonna do . in the car .
we &apos;ll be back in an hour .
hey , cam . congratulations . go , gay marriage .
he did it again .
ay , si ?
okay . well ...
so tell me , cam .
how does it work when it is between two men ?
well , i don &apos;t really feel comfortable
talking about that ... in front of lily .
i know how that works .
i rented the wrong movie once .
did you see &quot; glen , garry , glenn , and ross &quot; ?
uh , no .
why don &apos;t you go play ?
what i mean is ,
who proposes to who ?
i don &apos;t know . we &apos;ve talked about it , if it ever became legal .
okay , and now it is . so are you going to do it today ?
well , it just happened .
i haven &apos;t really had ...
oh , you have to do it today .
every couple deserve a beautiful proposal story .
well , i have always adored my mom and dad &apos;s story .
he plowed &quot; will you marry me ? &quot; into a snowy field
right outside of her window .
and then he tried to re @-@ create it
for their 25th wedding anniversary .
but there was no snow , so he burned it into a cornfield .
bad idea .
you know , but mama did get a second ring out of it
with the f.e.m.a. money .
ay , i wish i also had a romantic story .
one day , we were watching tv before dinner ,
and jay says , &quot; manny , hand me that thing . &quot;
and manny gives him the ring .
i mean , i was very happy , of course ,
but it is not the best story .
at least javier was on top of a dolphin .
soldiers talk about that moment when they shut off ,
when the war finally wins .
get down !
shut up !
i can &apos;t see the tv !
turn the fan on !
oh , stop yelling ! my head &apos;s going to explode !
for me , that moment is
four days into summer vacation .
hey , honey . what &apos;s up ?
do you remember when summer meant fireflies
and cutoff shorts and ice @-@ cream trucks ?
well , one out of three .
we &apos;ll get our time . they &apos;re all going away at some point , right ?
yeah , haley &apos;s got her beach trip ,
and alex is doing habitat for humanity ,
and luke has camp .
if i remember ,
i think we have six hours totally kid @-@ free on ...
oh , the 14th .
hey , if we moved alex &apos;s flight ,
we could have , like , 10 or 12 hours .
dream bigger , hot pants .
step aside .
sometimes i don &apos;t know if i love how much i fear claire ,
or fear how much i love her .
22nd to the 8th for alex ,
luke to the 14th ,
haley gets a day there .
come on .
that &apos;s it , beautiful mind .
harness that crazy into something positive .
shh ! if i can get alex to move her habitat for humanity
from oklahoma to sacramento
and luke to move his camp session ,
they will both overlap with haley &apos;s vacation ,
and i just bought us seven kid @-@ free days .
witchcraft !
yes .
i &apos;ve outdone myself , gloria .
i booked the restaurant from our first date ,
the same table overlooking the ocean ,
and i &apos;ll do it at sunset ,
which i &apos;ve recently discovered is my ideal lighting .
that &apos;s so romantic .
i know ! isn &apos;t it ?
oh , okay . oh , that &apos;s mitchell .
gotta go .
oh , don &apos;t let him hear the excitement in your voice .
you &apos;re right . you &apos;re right .
what ?
i &apos;m at that coffee shop on 3rd ,
and i forgot my wallet .
can you come bail me out ?
ugh . isn &apos;t this convenient ?
it actually was . i was only two blocks away .
but when i got there , i realized it was all a ploy
so he could propose .
but it was so sweet ,
i just decided to ditch my plans and let him do it .
mitchell , i &apos;m so sorry ,
but there is a massive pileup on the 405,
and , well , i have to go pick up lily .
and maybe you could just call claire or something ?
cam , cam , i got , like , 50 cents to my name .
have you decided on a tea ?
do they all cost the same ?
yeah .
look at that line .
probably everybody getting their gay marriage license .
i think it &apos;s just called a marriage license .
yeah , i don &apos;t know .
maybe we should go home and forget about it .
what ?
i &apos;ve been reading up on some of those tropical diseases --
malaria , yellow fever , rabies .
i &apos;m high risk , jay .
i &apos;m a big hand shaker .
you &apos;re fine . you &apos;ve had all your shots .
and that paco rabanne will scare away any mosquitoes .
jay , i &apos;m scared .
i &apos;m not sure i want to go through with it .
we didn &apos;t drive all the way down here for that piece of paper
for you to get cold feet at the last second .
and what happened , anyway ?
you &apos;ve been looking forward to this day for months .
i know . but maybe we should wait until next year .
i &apos;m still kind of young to be doing this .
we &apos;re not waiting .
i already paid for you , and your mother signed off .
this is happening .
great day , huh ?
hello !
oh , thank god .
i &apos;ve had so many cups of tea ,
they gave me my own one of these .
ohh . here you go .
so congratulations on the whole marriage thing .
how amazing is that , right ?
yeah .
we gonna hear some big gay wedding bells soon ?
ah , well , just wedding bells .
yeah . yeah , of course . we &apos;ve always talked about it .
but , you know ,
it &apos;s just -- just a matter of finding the right timing .
and then there -- there &apos;s a couple of other factors --
the tax implications and estate planning .
oh , stop . i &apos;m swooning .
i &apos;m just being practical .
you &apos;re the same way .
you -- you told phil to take back your engagement ring
and buy you a washer / dryer .
well , don &apos;t put this back on me . come on .
what is cam &apos;s biggest complaint about you ?
you &apos;re not romantic .
this is your opportunity .
mitchell , you should go home tonight
and surprise him with a big , splashy proposal .
he would really like it if i proposed to him .
i guess i could stop after work and pick up a card .
and ...
oh , my god . you &apos;re hopeless .
i know .
mitchell , okay .
this is what you do .
oh , boy .
it really should be your own idea , though .
no ! come on , come on . i need help . please ?
fine . okay .
tonight , you cook him his favorite meal .
you open the best bottle of wine .
and just as the two of you are sitting down to enjoy it ,
you break up with him .
what ? why ?
because then , as he is at his lowest ,
you pop the question .
he goes from agony to ecstasy !
it &apos;s so romantic .
you &apos;re kidding , right ?
more traditional ? okay .
all right . you look into his eyes ...
and you say , &quot; i saw a doctor .
he found a small dark mass . &quot;
what are you ?
and then just as he begins to cry ,
you pull out a black box with a ring in it .
there &apos;s your small dark mass !
it &apos;s genius !
y @-@ you &apos;re a disaster .
you could go the disaster route , too .
did you ever hear how i told phil we were gonna have luke ?
i said , &quot; thousands of children die every day ... &quot;
dad ?
i &apos;m sorry . was i being proud of you too loud ?
what are you doing ?
going off to habitat , helping all those people .
honey , i &apos;m speechless .
thanks . i just thought it was --
but are we sure about oklahoma ?
there &apos;s so many needy people right up in sacramento .
and it &apos;s driving distance .
i already signed up for my work detail ,
and i &apos;ve been e @-@ mailing with my tentmate .
yeah . no , you &apos;re right .
i guess it &apos;s just ...
no .
never mind .
what is it ?
no , it &apos;s stupid .
i &apos;ve just never been so far away
from my baby girl before .
not now , waterworks . not now .
oh , daddy .
you okay , dad ?
oh , hey , buddy . never been better .
you &apos;re so thoughtful .
i &apos;m gonna miss that when you go off to camp on the 14th .
little wiffle golf ?
wait . i cant &apos;t go to camp on the 14th .
i have to go when carly &apos;s going .
who &apos;s carly ?
she &apos;s this girl i like , and she &apos;s here right now .
well , all the more reason to change camp sessions .
absence makes the heart grow fonder . it &apos;s foolproof .
not this fool . forget it .
what about all the new girls you &apos;re gonna meet ?
you &apos;re only 14 .
do you really want to be tied down ?
yes !
oh , luke , watch . i @-@ i got it . okay .
okay .
nice !
oh , hi , mr. dunphy .
sorry we moved the furniture around .
i was showing luke
the flip i did at tumbling sectionals .
oh , no . that &apos;s my mom .
but i can leave you guys this old movie i brought over .
it &apos;s called &quot; dirty dancing . &quot;
never let her go .
hey , carly &apos;s mom . phil dunphy .
big fan of your daughter .
thank you .
get off me !
so , yeah , heads up . luke &apos;s got to change his camp session .
you guys may want to do the same .
no .
my husband and i have been working the white board all week ,
and we just bought three days away from that .
it wasn &apos;t even me !
bank it !
carly !
okay , manny , remember , as soon as you land ,
watch out for malaria .
why ? i got a shot for that .
can we hurry this up ?
no , i &apos;m talking about your cousin malaria .
she &apos;s coming to pick you up , but she might have rubella .
what ?
that &apos;s her daughter .
but make room in the car
because she could have diphtheria .
who &apos;s diphtheria ?
ay , manny , diphtheria is a disease .
that &apos;s why i want you to be apart from her in the car .
okay , let &apos;s go . gloria , better say goodbye here .
he &apos;s got to hurry to get through security .
but there &apos;s no line .
for now .
a senior tour bus just pulled up .
you know how much private wanding that is ?
half their skeletons are metal .
ay , manny , please . call me as soon as you land .
i &apos;ll miss you .
and we &apos;re walking .
i love you !
wait .
no . up !
i forgot to give mom this card i wrote .
uh , no , no , no . i &apos;ll handle it .
safe trip , buddy . safe trip .
we &apos;re out of here .
no , let &apos;s wait until he gets to the top .
adios , mi amor !
who wants ice cream ? huh ?
what if he never comes back ?
oh , honey , no one ever leaves home and doesn &apos;t come back .
i did .
hey , honey .
i &apos;ve been mulling over your sacramento decision .
it wasn &apos;t exactly my --
of course i want my baby girl close ,
but i got to get used to you leaving .
because college -- and knowing you , a great college --
is right around the corner .
am i right ?
now , habitat will look good on an application ,
but does sacramento really move the needle ?
i have another place in mind .
little hint -- it starts with an &quot; el . &quot;
el salvador ? are you serious ?
they have an unstable government
and -- and earthquakes .
boats . looks like there &apos;s a h @-@ hill .
i &apos;m just saying , you don &apos;t push yourself at this stage ,
you wind up at a second @-@ tier college .
soon you &apos;ve lost all your ambition .
you &apos;re just drifting through life ,
hoping someone offers you an &quot; m @-@ r @-@ s &quot; degree .
is that who you want to be ?
hey , princess . second breakfast ?
fun .
so , big beach trip coming up , huh ?
yeah .
can &apos;t get better than late july ,
unless it &apos;s early aug ...
save it , dad .
i know you and mom want the house to yourselves .
nope .
i &apos;m the last piece of the puzzle , right ?
what &apos;s it worth to you ?
fine .
how about i pay for gas and two dinners ?
mnh @-@ mnh . gas ,
all dinners , groceries , two new bathing suits ,
a boogie board , one of those ...
are you crazy ?
no . i &apos;m also not done .
yes , you are done .
you know why ?
you know another way this shakes out ?
you don &apos;t go .
that &apos;s right . overplay your hand , i pull the plug ,
you blow your last chance for a good time with your friends .
word gets out that you &apos;re not cool .
then school starts .
you end up with your nose in a book all year .
no friends , no dates ,
not caring how you look .
is that who you want to be ?
turns out mitchell really had forgotten his wallet ,
so proposing wasn &apos;t even on his radar .
my plan was bulletproof .
he was gonna be as blindsided
as the fattest hog on founder &apos;s day ,
and i was ...
pretty darn proud of myself .
i had the ideal proposal .
cam once told me that all he wanted
was someone to sit in a rocking chair and grow old with .
so while we &apos;re at dinner ,
claire is setting up two rocking chairs
next to the fireplace , with a bottle of champagne .
ohh . he is going to ...
squeal like a berkshire white
in a four @-@ man pig toss .
gosh durn it , i miss founder &apos;s day .
this is a little bit fancy for just a quick bite .
well , who knows if they can even get us in ?
let me check .
reservation for tucker .
is everything set up with the table ?
yeah .
the restaurant where we had our first date ,
the sunset lighting that cam loves ...
he was going to propose .
i @-@ i @-@ i was so touched ,
but at the same time , he was ruining the one chance i had
for romantic redemption .
oh , i &apos;m feeling really queasy , cam .
no , no , no . you &apos;ll be okay once we sit down .
i think i need to go home . sorry .
oh ! s-- excuse me . sorry .
no , no , no . we &apos;ll get you some ginger ale , some crackers .
mnh @-@ mnh . i &apos;m -- i got to run to the restroom .
you -- you grab the car .
well , you &apos;ll feel better after you throw up .
okay , new plan . we &apos;re coming back early .
is everything set up ?
you said two hours . we haven &apos;t even left yet .
well , hurry !
just stall .
tell him that ... haley had a hemorrhage ,
and you &apos;re her blood type ,
so you ...
i &apos;m not doing that , you ghoul .
just get back to the house and --
gloria .
cam , how did it go ?
did he ...
it didn &apos;t happen .
i have to go with the backup plan .
fortunately , i had an alternate proposal scenario
in case there was a problem .
jay and gloria were babysitting ,
so i asked them to re @-@ create
the picnic under the stars we had
the night we moved in to our first apartment .
mitchell would take one look and ...
sob like a tony winner .
i got the picnic basket .
but you know what is going to be hard to find ?
my interest in this whole damn thing ?
no , the blue @-@ and @-@ white tablecloth .
here it is . it was in the occasions closet .
they keep their tools in a pillowcase ,
but they have an occasions closet ?
what are you guys doing here ?
oh . cam is going to propose to mitch ,
so we &apos;re here to help him set it up .
that is coconuts !
mitchell asked us to do the same thing for him .
well , that just makes me want to stay
and see how this whole thing works out .
oh , we can . let &apos;s set it up and then we &apos;ll hide somewhere .
ay , yes , in the occasion closet .
no . we do what they asked and leave .
we never had these problems .
this is what happens when they let men marry men .
that cannot be a coincidence .
sorry about the detour .
i was just worried about the pileup on the 405 .
oh , take your time . the drive &apos;s actually soothing me .
oh ! oh , my gosh !
oh ! what -- what was that ?
oh . i think it &apos;s a blown tire . it &apos;s okay .
well , i know there &apos;s a spare . do -- do we have the tools ?
yeah , yeah . they &apos;re in the pillowcase in the trunk .
right .
why do you have to be so grouchy ?
we &apos;re giving them a beautiful story .
everybody deserves one .
i &apos;m an idiot .
oh , you &apos;re not an idiot . you &apos;re not as romantic as some --
these things peel off on the back ,
and i &apos;ve been gluing &apos; em .
why do i even bother ? you don &apos;t care about this stuff .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
yeah , like when you proposed to me .
&quot; hey , manny , hand me that thing . &quot;
that &apos;s my whole story .
hang on . that wasn &apos;t my fault .
i had something big planned .
you asked him for the ring .
i was asking for the remote . he jumped the gun .
he was supposed to give me the ring
later that night at the restaurant .
the waiter was gonna come by and offer coffee .
i was gonna say , &quot; no , thank you . it &apos;ll keep me up ,
and lately , i &apos;ve been loving my dreams ,
and there &apos;s one in particular i hope comes true . &quot;
manny gives me the ring .
i say , &quot; gloria -- &quot;
yes , jay ! yes , i marry you !
i love my new story .
little heads @-@ up -- there &apos;s no way i &apos;m not crying at this wedding .
phil , you cried on the way here .
i was on the brink already .
i watched &quot; dirty dancing &quot; before we left .
text from my dad .
oh , no .
he wants me to come visit him for a couple of days ,
but it &apos;s right in the middle of our kid @-@ free week .
oh , that &apos;s too bad . i guess you could take two days .
i may have mentioned to frank
that phil might be available that week .
the only thing better than a kid @-@ free week
is a couple of days carved out just for mama .
perfect .
yeah .
hey , you remember the day i proposed to you ?
of course i do .
i don &apos;t remember the exact date , but , yes .
march 19 , 1994 .
oh . yeah .
i was in such a bad mood that afternoon .
i was on day two of a st. patrick &apos;s hangover .
i don &apos;t remember that .
i just remember how crazy in love i was .
i couldn &apos;t wait to ask you .
i even ran a red light on the way to pick you up .
i still have the ticket .
no , you don &apos;t . why would you say something like that ?
are you kidding me ? i was racing to my life .
it &apos;s in a box at my dad &apos;s
with a bunch of other stuff --
the program from that concert where i met you ...
... the matchbook with the fake number on it you gave me ...
the souvenir goblet from our first date .
you really think i &apos;d throw away all those beautiful memories ...
... milady ?
i haven &apos;t seen that stuff for a long time .
i got to dig it out when i see my dad .
okay , stop . sorry .
what ?
i told your dad to call you
because i wanted some time for myself .
yeah , couple of days away from my perfect , romantic husband ,
who is far too good
for this cold @-@ hearted , bloodless wife @-@ bot .
you have blood .
honey , i just put the chairs in front of the fireplace .
you made it romantic .
mitchell &apos;s right . i &apos;m a ghoul .
come here .
you &apos;re romantic , too , in your own funny way .
we &apos;re just different .
so what if i &apos;m more sentimental ?
my mom .
i mean , sure ...
marriage needs romance .
you know what it also needs ?
&quot; spoke to phil , and he suggested -- &quot;
forgiveness .
okay . spare , please .
yes , doctor .
i can &apos;t believe this has happened to us so many times ,
we actually have a system .
oh , i know . you &apos;ve come a long way
from the first time you ever saw a jack .
remember , you couldn &apos;t believe ...
i &apos;m sorry . this is amazing .
i am lifting a car right now .
i am the strongest man in the world .
oh , do you remember that time in yosemite
when it was snowing so bad ?
yeah . what was that , like six years ago ?
oh , gosh . no , it was before lily ,
so it was at least seven or eight .
god , it is -- it &apos;s going by so fast .
yeah . you &apos;re telling me .
you know , it &apos;s a different world down there
than it was 24 hours ago .
cam , tire . tire !
oh , my gosh . oh , my -- oh , my god .
oh , my god !
it &apos;s gonna be a different world
for the people in that yellow house .
this is not at all how i saw the evening going .
honey , you have no idea .
do you remember our first apartment ?
yes . what -- what made you think of that ?
i don &apos;t know .
the stars .
all right . come on . let &apos;s do this .
yeah .
yes .
yes .
hey , there , you with the stars on your thighs .
huh ?
it &apos;s an old song . i thought i would ...
eh , why do i bother ?
what is this ?
oh . oh , that &apos;s from manny .
i was hoping to wait and give it to you in a couple of days .
but , uh , just remember that he &apos;s fine .
he &apos;s only a plane ride away .
nice .
i &apos;m going to wash my face .
okay .
i hope that my cousins don &apos;t take him riding the horses
or shooting the guns .
i know that he &apos;s almost a man , but ...
jay ?
&quot; make sure you take care of jay .
please call me after his checkup on thursday .
i &apos;ll miss you guys so much . &quot;
nice , huh ?
nice ?
