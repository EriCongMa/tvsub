for over a century , i have lived in secret--
until now . i know the risk ,
but i have to know her .
what are you ?
i &apos;m a vampire .
he told me about your ex , katherine .
you must be elena .
how do we look exactly alike ?
i don &apos;t want you seeing elena anymore .
if you don &apos;t remove her from your life ,
i will kill everyone that she loves .
the lockwoods are werewolves .
according to my uncle , you have to trigger the curse .
somebody has to die at your hands .
you tried to kill a werewolf and failed .
now you made an enemy .
thank you , mason . let &apos;s do this .
each with a stake in the heart , then burn them both .
hi , mom .
keep caroline away from me , please .
she &apos;s your daughter , liz .
not anymore .
i &apos;m just looking for this old piece of my mom &apos;s .
it &apos;s a moon stone . thank you .
you got it .
i got it .
you &apos;re staring .
i &apos;m gazing .
it &apos;s creepy .
it &apos;s romantic .
oh , this is bad of us .
mmm , yes , it is .
if katherine finds out ...
katherine who ?
ms. flowers will think i &apos;m a floozy
if i have a man in here .
why are you staying here ?
because i like this little bed and breakfast ,
don &apos;t you ?
i love it .
ok , i , um , i need to get in the shower .
love it . let &apos;s go .
no , just me .
i &apos;m late .
i &apos;m decorating at the lockwood charity thing .
well , what do you know ?
so am i.
you think that &apos;s really a good idea
to be at their house today ?
mason lockwood tried to kill you .
where &apos;s the moonstone ?
it &apos;s somewhere safe .
don &apos;t you trust me ?
i don &apos;t trust anyone .
i don &apos;t trust mason .
i want to be there today to keep an eye on him .
ok .
but then we can &apos;t touch , or talk .
and no lingering stares .
no . none of that .
what do you think will happen
if katherine finds out that we were fake fighting ?
you &apos;re scared i &apos;m going to kill you ?
no . you won &apos;t .
ow , kath , easy !
did i hurt you ? sorry .
did it hurt ?
it &apos;s ok .
a little bit every day will make you stronger , right ?
what happens once i give you the moonstone ?
we &apos;ll live happily ever after .
i promise .
i &apos;ll bring it tonight , i promise .
i promise you .
we &apos;re gonna get through this .
i love you , stefan .
you know i love you .
i love you , too .
i need to talk to you .
and why do i need to talk to you ?
tyler lockwood has to kill someone to activate his curse .
he &apos;s not a werewolf yet .
wow . fascinating . not enough .
but mason lockwood is ,
and he &apos;s looking for a moonstone ;
a special rock connected to the werewolf legend .
that &apos;s why he &apos;s here .
a moonstone ?
and i know where it is .
and you &apos;re bringing me this why ?
do i need a reason ? look , i just want to help , ok ?
what did your sister say about this little discovery ?
oh , you haven &apos;t told her , have you ?
elena doesn &apos;t want me getting involved in all of this .
and you &apos;re a gilbert and you just can &apos;t help yourself .
your search for life &apos;s purpose is as obvious as it is tragic .
you going to let me in or not ?
jenna . thanks for helping wrangle the volunteers .
of course .
for a good cause .
plus , i have always been a sucker for a masquerade ball .
so was richard .
this was always his favorite party of the year .
wait , wait , wait , tyler !
boys !
be careful with that , it &apos;s from the 1800s .
excuse me .
tyler !
mom , we got it .
stefan , hey .
hey .
i &apos;m cooking dinner tonight . rick will be there .
you should come .
you know , elena and i ,
we &apos;re kind of taking a ...
a pause .
really ?
yeah .
&apos;cause that &apos;s not what it sounded like this morning .
light sleeper .
you know what , i heard nothing .
you &apos;re here .
i &apos;m here .
caroline &apos;s not coming .
i told you .
just making sure .
you know , eventually you &apos;re going to have to talk to her .
could you make it a little less obvious you &apos;re on her side ?
there are no sides , bonnie .
oh , come on , elena . since caroline became a vampire ,
we barely see each other .
losing caroline was bad enough .
i didn &apos;t think i &apos;d lose you , too .
come with me .
where ?
not here .
some place quiet .
we need to talk .
you didn &apos;t eat much .
good news !
dr. damon said the vervain &apos;s almost out of your system .
so with any luck ,
you &apos;ll be freshly compelled
and back in your own bed by tonight .
are you really just going to pretend like i don &apos;t exist ?
yes .
so please go .
as usual , you don &apos;t care .
got it .
just like before i was a vampire .
it &apos;s not like i died or anything .
are you ...
are you really dead ?
yes and no .
how is it possible ?
rick !
what are you doing here ?
helping damon .
i &apos;m the one who found out about the moonstone .
does elena know you &apos;re here ?
not exactly .
what you got ?
oh , this is isabelle &apos;s research from duke .
her assistant sent it to me .
hmm . vanessa , the hottie .
yeah , vanessa , yes .
now do you remember the old aztec curse she told us about ?
sun and moon , blah blah blah .
aztec curse , cool .
yeah , supposedly
vampires and werewolves used to roam freely
until a shaman put a curse on them
to limit their power .
since then , werewolves can only turn on a full moon
and vampires are weakened by the sun .
most of them , anyway .
according to the legend ,
the werewolf part of the curse ...
it &apos;s sealed with the moonstone .
what do you mean , sealed ?
it &apos;s a witch thing . whatever seals the curse ,
is usually the key to unsealing the curse .
maybe mason lockwood believes
he can use the moon stone to break the curse .
if we start believing in some supernatural witchy @-@ woo legend
from a picture book , we &apos;re idiots .
who has the stone now ?
tyler .
can you get it ?
yeah .
see , now your life has purpose .
so you do believe it ?
same book that says
a werewolf bite kills a vampire .
ignoring it would make me an even bigger idiot .
let &apos;s go .
i can &apos;t believe this .
it &apos;s a lot , i know .
katherine has been doing everything that she can
to drive me and stefan apart ,
and caroline just got trapped in the middle .
it &apos;s not that you and stefan are pretending to fight .
it &apos;s that i didn &apos;t even know you guys were fighting at all .
i &apos;m sorry .
i don &apos;t want to keep things from you ,
but you &apos;ve made it pretty clear
where you stand with the whole vampire thing .
so that makes me the odd man out .
no .
no , bonnie , of course not .
i know where i stand , elena .
and i know where you stand .
but where do we stand ?
you &apos;re my best friend , bonnie .
i didn &apos;t mean to let this craziness with caroline
get in the way of that .
but she needs you , too .
not yet . i just ...
she &apos;s a vampire . i can &apos;t .
i think we should get back .
hey , stefan .
hi , mason .
wasn &apos;t expecting you here . or anywhere .
yeah , i had this little accident .
but i &apos;m fine now .
what did you do to sheriff forbes ?
oh , she &apos;s fine , too .
but from now on ,
you &apos;ll have to do your own dirty work .
not a problem .
excuse me .
what &apos;s matter , are you ok ?
when i touched him ,
i saw something .
what do you mean , like a vision ?
i saw elena .
you saw elena ?
he was kissing her .
no , bonnie , elena wouldn &apos;t kiss ...
you didn &apos;t see elena , you saw ...
katherine .
damon , what are you doing here ?
looking for my baby bro .
speaking of , would you tell yours to stop following me around ?
what &apos;s going on ?
ask eager beaver .
jeremy , what is he making you do ?
he &apos;s not making me do anything . damon and i--
ah , no .
no way . no , no , no , no .
there is no damon and you .
there &apos;s damon and whoever damon &apos;s using .
and those people , they end up dead .
whatever &apos;s going on , jeremy ,
i want you to stay out of it .
i don &apos;t really care what you want , elena .
it &apos;s because of you that i &apos;m in this mess in the first place ,
so , sorry , you don &apos;t really get to tell me
what i &apos;m going to do .
katherine &apos;s with mason lockwood ?
we missed it .
he got into town right after she did .
it makes perfect sense .
i know , but mason lockwood ? !
werewolf thing aside ,
the guy &apos;s a surfer .
she &apos;s gotta be using him .
she has to be .
using him for that ?
mason lockwood &apos;s looking for a moonstone
that allegedly can break the full moon werewolf curse .
maybe katherine wants it as well .
why ?
well ... no idea .
it &apos;s the beauty of katherine .
she &apos;s always up to something .
so how are we going to find this moonstone ?
jeremy &apos;s getting it from tyler .
why would you involve jeremy ?
he &apos;s playing indiana jones .
he involved himself .
she &apos;s this amazing girl one minute
and then this raging jealous freak the next .
look , you know what i think of caroline forbes .
she &apos;s an insecure , neurotic ,
bitchy little twit .
but the girl &apos;s got heart . she means well .
just gotta take the good with the bad sometimes .
yeah .
i &apos;m gonna go get an extension cord . i &apos;ll be right back .
hey , man .
hey , so i did a little research on that stone you showed me .
what ? why ?
i don &apos;t know .
curiosity , boredom .
what &apos;d it say ?
well , it turns out that it &apos;s part of this aztec legend ,
but i want to make sure it &apos;s the same kind of stone .
do you think i could check it out again ?
nope . gave it to my uncle .
why &apos;d you do that ?
because i &apos;m done with legends and curses .
i don &apos;t want anything to do with it , ok ?
yeah . yeah , sure .
it &apos;s probably just stupid folklore anyways .
forget it .
ok . ok .
this is as far as i go .
ok .
what do you want ?
a favor .
like that &apos;s going to happen .
so predictable . that &apos;s why i brought him .
i know how you feel about helping us out ,
but since you &apos;re the one that linked
to mason with katherine , we finally have
an opportunity to get an upper hand on both of them ,
so just hear us out .
pretty please .
i &apos;m listening .
i have to fill elena in on what &apos;s going on .
can you play nice please ?
i guess .
hey , what are you doing ? you shouldn &apos;t be calling me .
i know , but i have no idea what &apos;s happening .
damon &apos;s got jeremy into something ,
and you &apos;ve got bonnie with you ,
and i &apos;m sorting stupid masquerade masks
for mrs. lockwood .
all right , it &apos;s ok .
hold on .
all you need to do is touch with mason lockwood again ,
see if he gave katherine the moon stone .
my visions don &apos;t work like that .
i don &apos;t get to ask questions .
how inconvenient .
although ,
let &apos;s talk about that little witchy jr. thing you do with me .
you know , the fun one where my brain bursts into flames ?
what is that ?
that &apos;s me giving you an aneurism .
your blood vessels go pop .
but you heal quickly , so i do it over and over again .
is it vampire @-@ specific ?
it &apos;d work on anyone with a supernatural healing ability .
good . good , good .
damon , i &apos;m not going to help you hurt him .
mason lockwood &apos;s a werewolf .
katherine &apos;s evil . they &apos;re the bad guys .
really ?
you &apos;re going to play morality police with me right now ?
let me put it to you in another way--
they &apos;re a threat to elena .
so you , witch ,
are going to get over yourself and help us .
yeah , he meant that as a question
with a &quot; please &quot; on the end .
absolutely .
hey , can you move your van ?
blocked in .
hey , how &apos;d you get stuck doing that by yourself ?
all the guys bailed .
something about draft picks .
i don &apos;t know , i don &apos;t speak that language .
here , let me give you a hand .
sorry .
so i mainly drink from blood bags .
it &apos;s not as good as the fresh stuff ,
but it beats the animal blood
that stefan &apos;s been trying to get me to drink .
so you steal the blood from the hospital ?
damon does .
i &apos;ve been pilfering his supply , so ...
and as long as you have blood , you don &apos;t need to kill ?
i want to .
it &apos;s my basic nature now .
but on a healthy diet ,
i can control it .
i &apos;m getting better at it .
i &apos;m better than stefan .
he &apos;s a bit of a problem drinker .
a blood @-@ aholic .
i don &apos;t want this for you .
i know .
but when life gives you lemons ...
damon &apos;s home .
here &apos;s his bag .
as requested .
ok , grab that corner .
why are we doing this ?
because i don &apos;t want to stain the carpet .
i knew you were going to say something like that .
judging again .
he &apos;s not going to be out much longer .
looks like this guy &apos;s used to being tied up .
what are you doing ?
you &apos;re looking for a moon stone .
i am trying to help you find it .
oh , good , yeah .
find out if he gave it to katherine ,
and find out where she is .
and find out what they &apos;re going to do with it
once they get it .
somewhere small .
dark .
there &apos;s water .
like a sewer ?
no .
like a well ?
that can &apos;t be right .
yeah .
it &apos;s a well .
why would it be in a well ?
i told you ,
i only get what i get .
that &apos;s it . that &apos;s all i got .
hey , judgey .
thank you .
come on .
wake up , wolf boy .
how &apos;s your mom ?
elena filled me in on everything .
um , i &apos;m going to take her home tonight .
caroline ...
never mind , i gotta go .
did you , um ,
find the moon stone thing ?
not yet .
hey , do you remember that old well where we used to play
when we were kids ?
yeah .
it &apos;s in the woods . do you remember where ?
on the edge of the old lockwood property .
why ?
i think that &apos;s where mason is keeping the moonstone .
i gotta go .
well , i can come with you .
no , it &apos;s ok .
sure .
ok .
where &apos;s caroline ? this is like her thing .
i can &apos;t believe she &apos;s not here .
she had something else to do .
is she seeing someone ?
matt , come on . no , she &apos;s not .
anyone seen mason ?
he , uh , he took off . said he wasn &apos;t sure when he &apos;d be back .
so weird .
i &apos;m not even going to ask .
i &apos;ll be right back .
someone &apos;s feisty .
what ? !
damn it !
you can hurt . good to know .
i was afraid you were going
to be some beast mass with no affinity for pain .
oh , you heal quickly . not good .
guess i &apos;ll just have to keep applying pain .
so ... katherine .
how do you know her ? what &apos;s she up to ?
i have all day .
what &apos;s going on ?
you shouldn &apos;t be here .
i know , but i am .
what &apos;s going on ?
bonnie thinks the moon stone is down here .
hey . be careful .
only be down there for a minute .
elena !
stefan ? !
elena !
stefan , what &apos;s happening ?
what &apos;s going on in there ?
vervain !
oh , god ! help !
stefan !
stefan !
elena !
caroline , stefan &apos;s down there ,
and the chain is rusted ... no , no , no !
you can &apos;t . it &apos;s filled with vervain .
caroline , we &apos;ve got to get him out !
now !
when did you two meet ?
did she seduce you , tell you she loved you ?
you &apos;re supernatural so she can &apos;t compel you .
i &apos;m sure she used her other charms .
katherine &apos;s good that way .
i thought i told you to leave .
i found something in rick &apos;s box of stuff .
what is it ?
um , i did a search on my phone . it &apos;s a plant .
aconitum vulparia .
it grows in the mountainous areas of the northern hemisphere ,
commonly known as aconite ,
blue rocket and wolfsbane .
what else did you read ?
well , every source says something different .
one myth says it causes lycanthropy ,
which sounds bogus . and the other one says
that it protects people , and another one says , well , it &apos;s toxic .
i &apos;m guessing toxic .
what &apos;s katherine doing in mystic falls ?
why is she here ?
she &apos;s here with me .
why do you ask , you jealous ?
how rude of me .
you know , i just realized
i didn &apos;t offer you anything to eat .
yummy !
i got you , ok ?
yeah .
what &apos;s going on ?
you just took off in a blur .
i heard elena screaming . help her , now !
you ready ?
yeah .
sorry !
it &apos;s ok , keep going . come on !
hey ! oh ! oh , my god !
elena , what &apos;s going on down there ?
pull him up !
elena ?
ready for you .
hold on .
i need to find the stone .
hurry !
hold on ! i think i found it !
elena , what &apos;s going on ? !
i got it ! come on !
bring me up !
oh , god .
stefan !
i got the stone , stefan .
stefan , it &apos;s going to be ok .
everything &apos;s going to be ok .
why do you want the moonstone ?
screw you ! ahhh !
wrong answer .
if he was going to say anything , he would already .
i &apos;m taking your eyes now .
the well !
you &apos;ll find it there .
i know where it is .
i want to know what it does and why you want it .
i &apos;m getting it for katherine .
why ?
she &apos;s going to use it to lift the curse .
of the moon ?
now why would a vampire help a werewolf break a curse
that keeps them from turning whenever they want ?
so i wouldn &apos;t have to turn anymore .
why ?
because she loves me .
now ... now i get it .
you &apos;re just stupid . katherine doesn &apos;t love you .
she &apos;s using you , you moron .
i &apos;m done talking .
yes , you are .
time to take a walk , jeremy .
i &apos;m staying .
no , you should go .
i &apos;m staying , damon , he &apos;s had enough .
just help tyler .
don &apos;t let this happen to him .
damon ...
you wanted to be a part of this ?
well , here it is . kill or be killed .
the guy &apos;s a werewolf . he &apos;d kill me the first chance he got !
so you suck it up , or leave .
he wants me to kill him , anyway .
don &apos;t you , mason ?
it really is a curse , isn &apos;t it ?
you know , i look at you and i see myself .
a less dashing , less intelligent version .
i love her .
oh , i know !
i &apos;ve been where you are .
but katherine will only rip your heart out .
let me do it for her .
you &apos;re pretty hand with that thing .
yeah , well , it &apos;s a skill .
here .
hmm . where &apos;s the , um , the sea salt ?
table .
so i pulled stefan out of this well ,
and he &apos;s all vervained and just rotted .
but bonnie wasn &apos;t mean to me once ,
and i just--i really think it &apos;s progress , you know ?
i just-- what ?
i &apos;m freaking you out .
it &apos;s just that you &apos;ve become this person--
don &apos;t-- don &apos;t . i ...
i &apos;m just starting to get along .
this strong , this confident person .
thank you .
you don &apos;t have to take my memories away .
i &apos;ll keep your secret .
look , if you &apos;re worried about them ,
just say you compelled me .
i won &apos;t tell .
i &apos;ll never do anything to hurt you .
we never talk like this . ever .
and today meant so much to me .
me , too .
i know .
i know i can trust you .
but you &apos;re never going to trust them .
i &apos;m going to take you home .
you &apos;re going to forget that i &apos;m a vampire .
i &apos;m going to forget that you &apos;re a vampire .
you &apos;ll remember you got sick with the flu .
you had a fever .
chills , and ... ickiness .
and i made you soup .
and it was really salty .
and we bickered .
you got better .
and then your selfish little daughter--
who loves you no matter what--
went right back to ignoring you .
and all is right in the world .
all this for that ?
yep .
i see you &apos;ve exercised your usual restraint .
had to be done .
&quot; carol ...
&quot; big opportunity in florida ,
&quot; gonna be gone ... for a long time .
&quot; i &apos;ll send for my things
&quot; once i get settled . much love , mason . &quot;
let &apos;s get rid of the body .
last number dialed .
i wonder who that could possible be .
no , no , no , don &apos;t provoke her .
mason .
you should have been here an hour ago .
wrong boy toy .
damon .
for once you &apos;ve surprised me .
i assume mason &apos;s with you .
he &apos;s right beside me .
although his heart &apos;s across the room .
you shouldn &apos;t have .
i &apos;ve had a very busy day today .
killed a werewolf , found a moonstone .
hey , did you know that he hid the moon stone
in a bottom of a well full of vervain ?
guess he didn &apos;t trust you very much .
he did love you .
poor guy .
hey , where are you , &apos; cause , you know ,
i could bring him over .
last good @-@ byes and all that .
you have no idea what you &apos;ve just done .
aww , did i put a kink in your master plan ? i &apos;m so sorry .
do you honestly believe that i don &apos;t have a plan b ?
and if that fails , a plan c ,
then a plan d , and--you know how the alphabet works ,
don &apos;t you ?
send my love to stefan .
where &apos;s jeremy ?
oh , he went straight up to his room .
he said he wasn &apos;t hungry .
who &apos;s she talking to ?
i don &apos;t know .
everything go ok today ?
there were a few hiccups , but yeah .
of course , i understand .
elena , it &apos;s for you .
who is it ?
hello ?
hello , elena .
katherine .
did you enjoy your little rendezvous
with stefan this morning ?
i will always know , elena .
i will always be one step ahead of you .
when are you going to figure that out ?
do you know how easy it was to get inside of your house ?
to replace aunt jenna &apos;s vervain perfume ,
to convince her to stop drinking her special tea .
no .
jenna &apos;s been my little spy for days now .
but unlike you ,
jenna actually listens to me .
so when i suggested
that the world would be a much better place
if she were to just ...
jenna , no !
jenna . jenna .
well ... you get the idea .
hey , is she ok ?
the doctors told alaric that she got lucky .
she &apos;s going to make it .
she &apos;s going to be ok .
does she remember what happened ?
no , nothing .
it &apos;s all part of katherine &apos;s mind compulsion .
why would katherine hurt jenna ?
because she &apos;s trying to send a message
that she could get to anybody .
hey , hey , hey , come here .
it &apos;s gonna be ok .
no , it &apos;s not .
she &apos;s going to pay , elena .
i don &apos;t know how , but she &apos;s going to pay .
it looks good .
thanks .
it was nice to see matt today .
he hasn &apos;t been around for a while .
we &apos;ve both been busy , i guess .
have you seen mason ?
the guy &apos;s been awol all day .
actually , tyler ,
mason headed back to florida .
what ? !
i &apos;m sorry , honey .
i know how much you two hit it off .
so he just left .
i was hoping he &apos;d stick around .
i thought that with your dad gone ,
that ...
anyway , he &apos;s gone .
so i guess it &apos;s just you and me now .
i &apos;m so sorry .
we were stupid .
sneaking around ,
thinking that we weren &apos;t going to get caught .
i know .
we did this .
stefan , jenna &apos;s in the hospital ,
and jeremy could be next .
all because we didn &apos;t ...
we didn &apos;t listen to her .
because we &apos;re together .
stefan ...
i know what you &apos;re going to say to me .
then let me say it .
i &apos;ve been so selfish because i love you so much .
and i know how much you love me .
but it &apos;s over .
stefan , it has to be .
elena , i don &apos;t ...
no , stefan .
it has to be .
elena ...
i riled katherine up . i ...
i wasn &apos;t thinking . i didn &apos;t think .
it doesn &apos;t matter , damon .
she won .
katherine won .
i apologize if i seem rattled .
the circumstances have changed suddenly ,
and i had to adjust .
mind control is a necessary evil .
you see , i need a werewolf ,
and i &apos;ve lost the one that i had .
now tell me what you &apos;re going to do to help me get a new one .
i &apos;m going to go after tyler lockwood .
and you &apos;re not going to stop .
and i &apos;m not going to stop .
until ?
