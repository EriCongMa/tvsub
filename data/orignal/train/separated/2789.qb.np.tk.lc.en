why don &apos;t you talk to chandler about moving back ?
you really think he &apos;d take me ?
we had a good talk last night ...

nobody likes two eggs equally . i wanna know which one you like better .
what &apos;s the difference ? your eggs aren &apos;t here anymore .
you took your eggs and you left !
did you expect me to never find new eggs ?
maybe this isn &apos;t about the eggs .
maybe this is about the chicken that laid them .
what chicken ? there &apos;s no chicken .

i hated you when we were kids !
you hated me when we were kids ?
i hated you .
i loved you in a you &apos;re @-@ my @-@ brother- so @-@ l @-@ have @-@ to way ...
... but basically , i hated your guts .
why did you hate me ?
because you were mean to me ...
... and you teased me and you always got your way .
that wasn &apos;t fun for you ?
i can &apos;t believe you hated me .
but now i love you .
and not just because i have to .

you &apos;re just gonna have to stop pissing me off .
i can do that .
then i won &apos;t have to kill you .
so you wanna watch entertainment tonight ? .
thanks .
you know what ?
if you really wanna watch that serengeti thing , we can .
listen , you are not going to believe this ...
... but that is not me singing on the video .
how did you find out ?
the record company sent this paper for me to sign saying it &apos;s okay ...
... for someone else to sing for me . that was my first clue .
what will you do ?
i can &apos;t work with people who would do this .
sure .
i mean , this poor woman .
what woman ?
the voice woman .
she has a great voice , but she doesn &apos;t have a video .
okay , pheebs , but what about you ?
i have a video . pay attention .
this voice woman , she &apos;s so talented .
but according to the producer people , she doesn &apos;t have the right look .
she &apos;s like one of those animals at the pound ...
... who nobody wants because they &apos;re not pretty .
or you know , like some old dog who &apos;s kind of like stinky and
oh , my god ! she &apos;s &quot; smelly cat &quot; !
that song has so many levels .
hey , eddie .
you wanna play some foosball ?
no , thanks , man . i &apos;m not really into sports .
yeah , okay . all right .
doesn &apos;t matter . time for baywatch !
you like that show ?
you don &apos;t ?
it &apos;s just pretty people running around on the beach .
that &apos;s the brilliance of it .
the pretty people .
and the running .
i &apos;m gonna go read in my room for a little while .
okay , man .
i think of all the friends i &apos;ve known
but when i dial the telephone
no one &apos;s home
all by myself
don &apos;t wanna live
all by myself
anymore
all by myself
i &apos;m gonna start off with a little song called &quot; smelly cat . &quot;
oh , for those of you who are wondering , this is my real voice .
smelly cat , smelly cat
what are they feeding you ? everybody !
smelly cat , smelly cat
it &apos;s not your fault
they won &apos;t take you to the vet
you &apos;re obviously not their favorite pet
you may not be a bed of roses
and you &apos;re no friend to those with noses
