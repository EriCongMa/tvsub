mr. reddington .
we &apos;re going to work .
i can &apos;t look the other way .
not this time .
stand down .
nez rowan ... ?
go !
who let her go free ?
there are certain u.s. government missions .
they require the expertise of an independent organization .
the artax network .
you think our target is using them ?
you ready to roll in the mud
thought you &apos;d never ask .
stalder told ressler and navabi he never left his suite .
was he lying , or did he just forget ?
that doesn &apos;t look like a woman --
or a conversation -- he &apos;d have forgotten .
no , it &apos;s not the money .
you &apos;re offering a fair price , scottie .
i just don &apos;t have a place to hide the expenditures .
i &apos;m c.o.o. of a multinational corporation .
there &apos;s no line item
for engaging the services of armed mercenaries .
i &apos;m beginning to think it would be better ...
samuel .
shh . it &apos;s okay .
take a deep breath .
let &apos;s start over .
let &apos;s start with what you want .
you want to hire halcyon for a covert operation
to increase your corporate profits .
okay ?
and you &apos;re a little apprehensive , am i right ?
pretty much .
how long you been married ?
23 years .
have you touched another woman &apos;s breast in 23 years ?
no .
how &apos;s it feel ?
what are you feeling inside ?
apprehensive ?
no .
i &apos;m actually feeling pretty confident right now .
so many people live in fear of how they &apos;ll feel
if they step outside the lines .
the surprise is , it usually feels just like this .
well , as long as the breast belongs to someone you can trust .
be right back .
why don &apos;t you look over the contract ?
might be some wiggle room in our fee .
i wouldn &apos;t interrupt unless it was an emergency .
it &apos;s operation cobalt .
there &apos;s a problem .
♬ woke up feeling lonely ♬
♬ there &apos;s always something to be missed ♬
♬ i don &apos;t know if he regrets ♬

they didn &apos;t steal the weapons .

♬ but the voice tells me this ain &apos;t it ♬

what &apos;s the point of this ?
scottie .
didn &apos;t want to open it .
it &apos;s addressed to you .
♬ or you lay that burning down ♬
♬ hold that fire ♬

mr. reddington says her name is
susan scott hargrave .
reddington told you this at your apartment ?
right . okay , yeah . so ...
i &apos;m sitting there eating a half gallon of ice cream --
rum raisin -- when he suddenly shows up .
mr. reddington at my door in the middle of the night .
i know . kind of weird .
although , truth be told ,
we do sort of have a special relationship .
anyway , i showed him the picture ,
and he recognized her right away .
called her scottie .
says she and her husband , howard ,
own a corporation called halcyon aegis .
halcyon provides security services .
according to their website , yes .
but mr. reddington says
they are a private military @-@ intelligence agency
who specializes in operations too sophisticated
or politically incorrect for anyone else ,
like working with israel to sabotage iran &apos;s nuclear program
or negotiating with terrorists for the release of hostages ...
in direct violation of american foreign policy .
or to abduct an fbi agent from her own wedding .
so , what ? you &apos;re the , uh , new agent keen ?
he &apos;s here at my invitation .
we all want the same thing -- susan hargrave .
or whoever hired her to go after liz .
the white house counsel
specifically told me not to investigate halcyon .
after panabaker did that , i tasked tom to follow her .
she made a beeline for hargrave ,
presumably to warn her
that the fbi was about to investigate her .
so you &apos;re saying that our government
is protecting the people who took agent keen ,
hiding them from us ?
please tell me that is not true .
solomon led the attack on the church ,
so we know he works for halcyon .
i don &apos;t care what panabaker said .
that should be enough to get a warrant ...
which brings us to benjamin stalder .
he lied to us about knowing hargrave .
where are we on him ?
nowhere .
we don &apos;t know why halcyon was after him ,
and he has been off the grid since we let him go .
but we do know that his assistant is amanda bigelow .
if her boss can get us to hargrave ,
we need to force her to get us to her boss .
or we could try and get the intel without her knowing .
if one of you could get close enough to her ,
i think i can get what we need .
i can .
done . work with aram .
and reddington -- what &apos;s his plan ?
halcyon &apos;s off limits .
elizabeth keen is dead .
i heard .
and after all you did to protect her , too .
boy , i can &apos;t wait to hurt you someday .
i &apos;m sorry .
are you ?
a former cabal operative
led the assault that resulted in her death --
matias solomon .
you bungled his execution .
he works for halcyon now .
i want him , and i want scottie hargrave .
i despise halcyon .
they &apos;re powerful , arrogant , and unchecked ,
but our government depends on them .
your government . not mine .
give halcyon a call , laurel .
inform them that you have a job
that requires their immediate attention .
i &apos;m a national security advisor to the president .
i don &apos;t have the authority nor the discretion to act on my own .
that &apos;s nonsense .
if henry kissinger taught us anything ,
it &apos;s that the national security council has tremendous latitude
in both advising the president and shielding him .
you do many things he doesn &apos;t want to know about .
and i can tell you the president
doesn &apos;t want to know about what i have in store for halcyon .
the cabal disavowed solomon and made peace with keen .
we had nothing to do with this .
elizabeth keen was well hidden from the demons of her past
until you went after her ,
until you told the world she was masha rostova .
you put a target on her back
and invited someone to take a shot .
do not try my patience , laurel .
on this topic , i have perilously little of it .
what &apos;s the job ?
amanda bigelow is a creature of habit .
she goes to the same coffee shop every day for lunch ,
laptop in hand .
all you need to do is get close to her .
you &apos;ll have a device called a wireless packet sniffer .
it has the ability to mirror her computer .
the sniffer looks like a mobile hotspot ,
so just set it out on the table ,
and i &apos;ll do the rest .
thanks a lot , man .
you just alerted the target to my presence .
are you set up ? i &apos;m not getting anything .
i &apos;m set up .
how far away ?
maybe 20 feet .
okay , get closer .
all right , i &apos;m sitting right next to her .
i cannot get any closer .
something &apos;s wrong .
i &apos;m not getting any signal from her computer .
abort . abort .
did you say &quot; abort &quot; ?
uh , whatever . just -- we need a new plan .
they &apos;re all drafty .
what &apos;s that ?
i saw you switch tables .
you &apos;re trying to get away from the vents ,
this is the best spot .
you &apos;re welcome to join me .
oh , that &apos;s , uh ...
oh , i &apos;d love that , but it was work calling ,
so i should get back to the office .
that &apos;s unfortunate .
it is unfortunate .
what &apos;s your name ? i &apos;m reggie .
amanda .
i was in with scottie when you called .
she wants you to know the company &apos;s full resources
are at your disposal .
how can we help ?
i &apos;ve always liked you , brad .
it &apos;s important to me that you know that .
i &apos;m glad to hear it .
always nice to have a fan in the white house .
you do .
unfortunately , my job at the white house
has nothing to do with why you &apos;re here .
i don &apos;t understand .
you &apos;re here at my invitation .
no , no , no . please , bradley , stay seated .
this is an informal meeting .
you know who i am ?
yes , of course .
i didn &apos;t realize you two were acquainted .
oh , my , yes .
laurel &apos;s as crooked as a dog &apos;s hind leg .
i &apos;m so sorry .
about what ?
if this is about agent keen ,
what happened at the church ,
i had nothing to do with that .
friends and loved ones are dead .
i need to speak with scottie about the matter .
i sent her a message . she ignored it .
she &apos;s scared .
can be a terrible thing for all
when someone as ruthless as scottie gets scared .
i need you to reach her for me , bradley .
i trust you would get through to her .
i need her to pay attention to this .
i understand .
believe me , mr. reddington , there are very few people
that scottie pays better attention to than me .
yes , i &apos;m counting on that .
god , i &apos;m starving .
what time is it ?
we &apos;ll be hitting various facilities ,
but i want you to spearhead the main operation
at the port of amsterdam tomorrow .
that &apos;s not a lot of lead time .
is the oil on a tanker ?
barrels loaded into cargo containers .
less conspicuous .
that &apos;s too bad .
i never got to sink a ship before .
how big a team will you need ?
i &apos;d keep it small . just me and a transport crew .
single charge , let the oil do the work for me .
how bad ?
he killed brad clark .
this was pinned to his body .
you look frightened .
you should be .
红
what do you want me to do ?
about this ? nothing .
reddington &apos;s not gonna stop , you know .
neither are we .
you have your assignments . go do them .
susan hargrave has a wanted fugitive on her payroll .
rumor has it so do you .
nobody &apos;s issuing a warrant for your arrest .
matias solomon coordinated the assault on my team
that resulted in the death of elizabeth keen .
how do you know solomon wasn &apos;t working on his own ?
the man with susan hargrave is benjamin stalder .
an hour after this photo was taken ,
solomon and his team attempted to abduct him .
she met with him , then tried to abduct him ? why ?
for the purposes of a warrant ,
all that matters is that she did .
i &apos;m simply trying to dot the &quot; i &apos;s &quot; and cross the &quot; t &apos;s . &quot;
spare me the scrupulous @-@ lawyer routine , rodney .
we go back way too far for that .
i &apos;m just looking for probable cause .
who got to you ?
the a.g. ? the white house ? who ?
my agent , my friend
is dead because of susan hargrave .
then i suggest you get the evidence to prove it .
i have the evidence !
i &apos;m sorry , harold .
but i disagree .
the warrant was denied .
on what grounds ?
power , influence , fear .
where are we on amanda bigelow ?
nowhere yet .
we tried hacking her laptop ,
but she was on a highly encrypted network ,
so tom started talking with her ,
and seriously , this guy should write a book .
anyway , we are implementing plan &quot; b &quot; tonight ...
on their date .
how come that doesn &apos;t surprise me ?
so , no warrant , no stalder ,
no susan hargrave .
no , but we do have this .
reddington got access to a secure cellphone
from one of halcyon &apos;s account reps , bradley clark .
based on the bloodstains ,
i don &apos;t think it was given voluntarily .
mr. clark made three calls today to another secure cell .
now , we can &apos;t trace the owner of that cell ,
but believe it or not , it is on right now ,
so i have been triangulating its location .
they are somewhere on this block near eighth and king .
i &apos;m still running algorithms , but i should be able to vector it down
within a few hundred square feet .
get there now . if we can &apos;t get to halcyon through the front door ,
we &apos;ll have to kick down the back .
aram , we &apos;re on site .
okay . signal is on the move .
halfway up the block on your left .
target should be walking south .
how do we know who the target is ? it could be anybody .
hang on . let me lock onto both of your signals ,
guide you that way .
okay , you need to cross the street .
they are heading towards you about 100 feet up the block .
you should be able to see the target .
aram , i &apos;m seeing a lot of people here .
you are right on top of them .
what -- what just happened ? it &apos;s gone .
gone ? what do you mean , it &apos;s gone ?
lost the signal .
maybe they went into a building .
target &apos;s back .
okay , now look right behind you .
excuse me , sir .
wait . i &apos;m on the phone .
hey , fbi .
i need to see some identification .
okay , that is him . you are on the dot , literally .
um , i got to go , ted . i &apos;ll call you back .
no , let me see your phone .
this is not a secure phone .
do you have another one on you ?
no .
what is this all about ?
guys , what is going on ?
you are letting him get away .
okay , look for a car .
guys , look for a moving vehicle .
stop !
you are letting him get away .
did you get a plate ?
yes .
and one better .
samuel rand .
vice president of vestant petroleum ,
an oil and gas company .
all right .
let &apos;s bring him in ,
find out what their business is with halcyon .
we bring rand in , he brings his five lawyers with him ,
and we get nothing .
just like we got nothing with the u.s. attorney .
yes , maybe , but what ?
because it &apos;s not good enough ,
we &apos;re just gonna do whatever it takes ?
as far as i &apos;m concerned ,
susan hargrave has liz &apos;s blood on her hands .
when i watched them lower her into the ground ,
i promised myself that people would be held accountable ,
that i would see to it .
and by any means , that &apos;s what i &apos;m gonna do .
you &apos;re late .
i stopped to pick up your perfume .
there &apos;s a man here who wants to buy our brownstone .
a lester mcsomething @-@ or @-@ other .
he &apos;s a friend of the realtor .
our brownstone isn &apos;t for sale .
it might be .
you should hear the numbers he &apos;s throwing around .
really ? okay .
guess it doesn &apos;t hurt to listen .
lester , right ?
hello , lester .
you must be samuel !
what a pleasure .
what a garden . i love daffodils .
my wife tells me you &apos;re interested in buying our house .
they say gifting a bouquet of daffodils ensures happiness ,
while presenting just one
means bad luck is on the horizon .
okay , boys . i hope you &apos;re hungry .
i have a triple crème , some jarlsberg , water biscuits ,
and my mother &apos;s famous cucumber dip .
that sounds delicious , cynthia .
tragically , there &apos;s no time for snacks .
well , maybe some of mom &apos;s famous cucumber dip .
who are you ?
what do you want ?
you recently contracted halcyon
for a job on behalf of your company .
i &apos;d like to know the details .
i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
cynthia , is that a touch of cayenne in there ?
what a nice little kick .
samuel , just tell him .
tell me what ?
it &apos;s about oil .
shut up , cynthia .
no , i will not shut up , samuel .
he has got a gun .
a competitor of vestant &apos;s is buying oil from terrorists --
the really bad ones .
so vestant hired halcyon to get involved for some reason .
i don &apos;t know what . tell him , samuel .
you &apos;re doing nothing wrong . these people are evil .
i can &apos;t believe this .
i read his e @-@ mails .
ever since i found him with the nanny , i look at everything .
we don &apos;t even have a nanny !
it was a movie .
a nanny movie ?
not just nannies .
schoolteachers , nurses ,
and a ridiculous threesome
with two completely unbelievable policewomen .
cynthia , they &apos;re just movies .
i have never cheated on you .
and besides , i don &apos;t think he wants to hear about it .
yes , i want to hear about it .
all about it .
unfortunately , i do need to hear about your contract with halcyon .
so business first ,
and then , cynthia , i &apos;ll be all ears .
so , if we couldn &apos;t get into amanda &apos;s network today ,
what &apos;s gonna be different tonight ?
tonight , you jump her air gap .
no . oh , i &apos;m not ...
no , what i &apos;m suggesting
is that you insert this thumb drive into , uh , her laptop .
it -- it &apos;s got an exploit that will give us access to her computer
and her company &apos;s proprietary telecommunications infrastructure --
e @-@ mails , phone calls .
should lead us to her boss .
look , what you thought i was suggesting before ,
i would never , ever suggest ... that .
what &apos;s the catch ?
no catch . it is just plug and play .
downloads automatically in one to two minutes .
got it .
hello , harold .
hello , reddington , dembe .
please , sit down .
i had an enlightening meeting
with samuel rand today .
more to the point , with his wife , cynthia .
what &apos;s the connection between rand &apos;s company and halcyon ?
he contracted them to help tame a savage competitor ,
kerogent holdings ,
who &apos;s been flooding the market with cheap oil
and driving down prices ...
to which i would normally give a hearty free @-@ market thumbs @-@ up ,
but the oil in question is being purchased from radical jihadists ,
the proceeds being used to fund all manner of nastiness .
you &apos;re telling me halcyon was hired to fight terrorism ?
no .
given the recent glut on the market ,
oil companies around the globe are hemorrhaging .
this is about profits .
halcyon will be attacking on multiple fronts .
i &apos;m only interested in one aspect of the operation .
kerogent is acquiring a large shipment
of the offending petroleum at the port of amsterdam .
halcyon has plans to prevent the sale .
and you want us to let it go through ,
even if it benefits terrorists ?
no , i want you to take the oil .
the terrorists lose ,
we force scottie hargrave from the shadows ,
and turn a tidy profit in the process .
profit ?
if we do this , the government gets the oil , not you .
harold , smile .
we &apos;re this close .
i &apos;ll task a team to stake out the docks .
as for a smile ...
how are you holding up ?
as long as we keep moving forward , i &apos;ll endure .
still no movement here .
here comes headband again .
wave to dreadlocks .
they &apos;re nothing if not consistent .
at this rate , it &apos;s gonna take all night to finish loading .
you would have thought that kerogent
would have just sent a tanker .
too conspicuous . it &apos;s illegal oil .
they had to ship it in barrels
and hide it in shipping containers .
anything you can feed me from the aerial view ?
no , all quiet .
still no sign of halcyon .
maybe they &apos;re waiting for the convoy
to get on the road before they hit it .
that &apos;s what i &apos;d do .
&quot; fast @-@ and @-@ furious &quot; style .
get some street racers to board the trucks
and overpower the drivers , right ?
no .
headband back already ?
that was fast turnaround .
that &apos;s not headband . it &apos;s one of halcyon &apos;s people .
swat command , move in now .
nobody gets in or out of that yard .
where is she ?
eyes ! do you have eyes ?
we &apos;re under fire !
talk to me , 3 @-@ 8 .
proceed to the end of your aisle ,
turn left , then down three more .
that &apos;s where you &apos;ll deliver the package .
guys , i &apos;m getting reports of explosions
at kerogent facilities across europe and the middle east .
they &apos;re coordinating their attacks .
we need to get to rowan before she sets off that device .
keep moving north . next container on your right .
there . stop .
you &apos;re dead center .
maximum bang for your buck .
you &apos;re gonna want to move quickly .
roger that .
swat , you need to find that device .
there .
i &apos;ve got it .
okay .
looks like a remote trigger .
if the detonator is built into that case ,
there will be no way to disarm the device in time .
if this thing goes off , every one of these containers
goes off with it , one after the other .
okay , you need to evacuate as many people as possible .
okay . i , uh ...
i &apos;ll try to get it someplace where it can &apos;t do much damage .
no . are you crazy ? leave it .
she could detonate it in your hands .
just get the people out .
fall back . move the civilians to safety .
i &apos;ve got a container here .
if nothing else , it will help contain the ...
swat command .
swat command , come back .
... escaped . do you copy ?
strike team got away , but the detonation was contained .
we &apos;re gonna find these guys .
make no mistake . we &apos;re gonna find them .
okay .
i told you my whole long boring life story .
now it &apos;s your turn .
all right .
well , uh , i also was a teenage beauty @-@ pageant winner .
you promised you wouldn &apos;t make fun of that .
sorry .
come on . what &apos;s hidden in there ?
there &apos;s got to be some sort of flaw ,
some deep , dark secret .
every guy i meet has one .
shouldn &apos;t you find out a man &apos;s deep , dark secret
before you invite him into your apartment ?
where &apos;s the fun in that ?
i was married .
she , uh ...
she died .
i &apos;m really sorry .
and i am dipping my toe back into the dating pool for the first time .
and i have a daughter .
do you expect that to scare me away ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t know what to expect .
did that spill ?
no , it &apos;s fine .
are you sure ?
i &apos;m so sorry .
oh , my god , i feel so -- hold on .
oh , no .
let me , uh ...
i -- i &apos;ll be right back .
sorry .
that &apos;s fine .
i feel like an idiot .
i &apos;m okay .
sorry it took so long .
it was totally worth the wait .
what &apos;s wrong ?
um ... sorry .
i @-@ i thought i was , uh , ready for this .
i &apos;m probably moving too fast , huh ?
no , no , you &apos;re ...
you &apos;re wonderful , but i think i might be moving ...
too fast .
so , this is it ?
we &apos;re in the system ?
yes .
i don &apos;t want to know how you did it , but ...
yes .
actually , i do want to know how .
i don &apos;t understand how you could do it .
agent keen loved you .
i know it &apos;s none of my business , but ...
i loved her , too .
okay , good .
excellent .
no , it probably shouldn &apos;t matter , but it somehow does .
so , uh , let us see what our ms. bigelow is up to .
hello , raymond .
scottie , you got my messages .
well , amsterdam was a little hard to ignore .
attacking my people is one thing ,
but you &apos;re driving away my clients .
so , let &apos;s get this over with .
what do you want to discuss ?
the death of elizabeth keen .
a tragedy .
by all accounts , she was a fine woman
for whom we went to great lengths
to deliver to a caring party .
but then you felt the need to interfere .
might i suggest your anger isn &apos;t with me , but with yourself ?
i want to discuss this in person .
fine .
5 : 00 p.m. today , bwi airport ,
first @-@ class lounge , concourse f.
that &apos;s impossible .
i &apos;m on every apprehend list
from here to siberia .
i cannot step foot in an international airport
without being arrested .
all that pesky security
and facial @-@ recognition software and whatnot .
oh , not to mention all those annoying metal detectors ,
all of which is exactly why i will feel safe to meet there .
if you want to meet with me , you &apos;ll figure out a way .
i &apos;ll be there .
5 : 00 p.m. , raymond .
you know i don &apos;t like to be kept waiting .
i don &apos;t have a return date yet for mr. stalder ,
but i know that he &apos;s anxious to talk to you ,
so as soon as i do , i &apos;ll get back to you .
i mean , this is going nowhere .
patience .
patience .
i think you might be a little too patient .
what ?
no .
no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no .
believe me .
you wouldn &apos;t understand .
you know this is gonna end , right ?
reddington was only here because of liz .
you , samar , all of you ...
we &apos;re only here because of her .
so before it ends ...
just tell her .
you &apos;ll never know what she &apos;s gonna say unless you do .
mr. stalder &apos;s office .
how may i be of service to you today ?
it &apos;s susan hargrave . put him on .
holy crap . jackpot .
i &apos;m sorry to call , mr. stalder ,
but you said you wanted to know
when mrs. hargrave contacted your office .
put her through .
turn it up .
you &apos;re on with mrs. hargrave .
wow . you got a lot of guts calling me .
hello , benjamin .
i have to imagine you are a little confused by recent events .
rest assured , we are not in the habit
of kidnapping our own clients .
oh , no , no , no , no . no , i &apos;m not confused .
no , i understand perfectly .
my employer paid you to kidnap elizabeth keen ,
and then you not only failed to deliver the target ,
but your people got her killed .
so then you went after me
so you &apos;d have a bargaining chip against my boss ,
who wants you dead .
simmer down , benjamin .
i &apos;m calling to offer your employer an olive branch ,
but if you don &apos;t want it , i &apos;m more than happy
to shove the branch up your ass .
go ahead . i &apos;m listening .
raymond reddington .
if i recall our original conversation , you want him dead .
if i kill him , would that help make things right
between our companies ?
well , i &apos;m sure it would help , but that &apos;s impossible .
no one &apos;s been able to get to reddington .
and yet i &apos;m on my way to meet with the man now .
will you be so dear as to convey my offer to your boss ?
she &apos;s here . bring him in .
copy that .
she &apos;s inside , raymond .
yes , tom ?
stay out of the airport . don &apos;t go inside .
we intercepted a call from hargrave to stalder .
it &apos;s a trap .
can &apos;t say that i &apos;m surprised .
disappointed , perhaps .
kill or capture ?
kill .
your head is a peace offering
for them botching the job with liz .
thank you , tom .
shall we turn around ?
no . let &apos;s keep our appointment .
scottie hates to be kept waiting .
next .
thank you for your cooperation .
boarding pass and i.d. , please .
all belts , cellphones , keys .
empty your pockets .
next .
next , please .
sir . sir .
you &apos;ve been randomly selected for a check .
good , thanks .
my campaign does not coordinate with any pacs .
i &apos;m honored they want me to be president ,
but i don &apos;t tell them how to spend their money ...
although i like how they &apos;re spending it .
have you seen the ads ?
attention , travelers .
as president , i will say no to amnesty ,
defend the second amendment ,
and return the job of educating our children
to where it belongs -- at the local level .
i will stand firm with the american people
whether washington likes it or not .
911 . what &apos;s your emergency ?
hands in the air -- now !
over your head !
on the ground .
arms behind you .
it &apos;s him .
raymond reddington .
been staring at your &quot; wanted &quot; photo
in the break room for years .
can &apos;t wait to see the captain &apos;s face .
we &apos;re gonna get medals before this thing is over .
sorry , brother .
whatever she &apos;s paying you , i &apos;ll triple it .
she told me you &apos;d say something like that .
all right , watch his head now .
if you care so much for your partner ,
what are you gonna do when he wakes up ?
you just hit him on the head .
he got jumped from behind by your man ,
who kidnapped me and helped you to escape .
that &apos;s what will be in my report .
there &apos;s no cameras back here .
stairs .
she &apos;ll have me killed . you know that , right ?
you &apos;re walking me to my execution .
all i know is , mrs. hargrave &apos;s
fully sanctioned by the u.s. government .
figure that makes me a defense contractor .
i &apos;m gonna buy my wife one of them candy @-@ colored houses
in bermuda she loves ...
retire with the money from this job .
i once spent part of a summer in bermuda .
the island . certainly not the shorts .
not a lot to do there except ride motor scooters
and play checkers with the locals .
i &apos;m more of a chess man myself .
but one tactic that came naturally
was the concept of forced capture --
sacrificing a checker to force your enemy in one direction
while your forces lie in wait
for the exquisitely satisfying double jump .
one quick look at the airport schematics
revealed why scottie chose the lounge
on concourse f.
conveniently located
near a little @-@ used loading dock .
shall we ?
please !
don &apos;t kill me .
i said &quot; double jump . &quot;
you &apos;re merely the first capture .
please , if you would .
here we comes .
close the door .
sniper !
where is he ?
i don &apos;t see him !
step out slowly .
god , that door is slow .
i was hoping for a somewhat more dramatic entrance ,
but what the hell .
scottie .
aren &apos;t you the challenging woman to pin down .
the fbi just received a call from airports authority .
mr. reddington escaped police custody
from a first @-@ class lounge at bwi .
that can &apos;t be right .
tom called reddington
and warned him the airport was a setup .
all i know is that one officer &apos;s missing ,
one &apos;s injured , and i cannot reach mr. reddington .
get over there and find out what happened .
i have to give you this , raymond --
it &apos;s been years since a man
worked this hard to gain my attention .
who hired you to go after elizabeth keen ?
howard would be so happy to see you .
he still tells that story at dinner parties
about the night you two were jumped in kuala lumpur .
each time i hear it , there are five more machetes
you two had to fight off .
my fondness for your husband holds no currency here .
i didn &apos;t kill masha .
elizabeth keen , whatever you want to call her .
she died in childbirth .
perhaps if she &apos;d been in a proper hospital --
aah ! damn you !
i couldn &apos;t foresee what happened to that poor girl
any more than you .
i told you i was hired to abduct her ,
not take her life .
who hired you ?
you know exactly who hired me .
i &apos;d like to be sure .
alexander kirk .
talked to the guard .
he says that his partner jumped him from behind .
why ? to help reddington ?
more than likely the guard was in on the abduction ,
which reddington walked right into
despite knowing it was a trap .
i &apos;m looking at a report that says the containers
of oil we seized never made it into evidence .
it seems the entire convoy was hijacked this morning .
you think reddington took it ?
let &apos;s just say i get the feeling he has an agenda here
he &apos;s not sharing with us .
you know , i used to have such high hopes
for your organization .
high hopes for howard .
halcyon was once such a promising company ...
like aol .
put an entire generation online .
companies can so easily lose their way .
forget what it was that made them great to begin with .
i remember a time when your husband
never would have taken a job from a man like alexander kirk ,
if only out of respect for his friends .
howard didn &apos;t take that job .
we haven &apos;t had sex in four years .
we &apos;re rarely in the same country , let alone the same bed .
what bed have you been occupying ?
i &apos;ve been assuming a larger role
in a management position lately .
you don &apos;t say .
we &apos;ve never been more successful .
listen , red ...
i regret what happened to elizabeth keen .
but her kidnapping was simply a business decision .
you of all people should recognize that .
we all do what we have to in order to survive .
i know howard and i do .
survival is all relative .
there are limits , even for people like us .
especially for people like us .
when kirk hired us to abduct masha ,
he also wanted me to kill you .
sorry i didn &apos;t take that job .
here &apos;s where we stand .
elizabeth keen is dead , which means you are , too .
alexander kirk is coming to kill you .
the only surprise is that i got to you first .
you killed a lot of people trying to reach me .
well , here i am .
finish what you came to do .
you have it all wrong , dear .
i didn &apos;t come to kill you .
i came here because you and i
are about to climb into bed together , just for a quickie .
we now share a mutual enemy .
so , let &apos;s get you bandaged up ,
not that you aren &apos;t even lovelier
with a little blood trickling down your arm .
