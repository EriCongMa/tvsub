nick ! we need to talk .
winston stays . end of discussion .
no , dude .
i got your thanksgiving invitation .
did you make this ?
absolutely not .
he &apos;s announcing thanksgiving !
with his little trumpet , he &apos;s announcing the feast !
it &apos;s so funny ...
we should name that little guy roger .
when your testicles fell off ,
did you form lady parts ,
or is it kind of like a gonzo nose down there ?
it &apos;s really interesting .
yeah .
you see , the thing is ,
my testicles haven &apos;t fallen off ...
right .
... it &apos;s just the morning .
and my testicles do this really unique thing
of burrowing ... when it &apos;s cold out .
you &apos;re burning me .
i gotta be real with you .
please .
i know how a guy can get , like ,
lost in a relationship .
i &apos;ve been there , dude . you &apos;re snuggling ,
you &apos;re snuggling , you &apos;re snuggling ,
and then , bam !
next thing you know , you &apos;re wearing
a jean skirt and a tube top with no panties on ,
because you guys said you were gonna
dress up like each other for halloween .
but she doesn &apos;t dress up like you .
but you still go to the party .
i could not be more sorry for you ,
but that &apos;s not my story .
stand up .
stand up ?
yeah .
okay .
are those jessica &apos;s pajama bottoms ?
it &apos;s , uh ... football player pants for , uh ,
br @-@ breast cancer awareness .
i like the way that they hug my gronk .
camping on thanksgiving ?
it might be a crazy nick idea , but i kind of like it .
i thought you hated camping and nature .
you said you were afraid a fly was gonna
fly in your head and learn all your thoughts .
i am a man , and men belong in wilderness .
it really means a lot to me .
the only thing i care about
is that we &apos;re all together .
and that we can all sit down together
and have a nice dinner .
i 100 % agree .
i think everybody &apos;s gonna love this idea .
me , too .
camping ? what the hell ?
like we &apos;re animals ?
come on . hear him out .
let &apos;s face it .
our indoor thanksgivings haven &apos;t been so great .
turkey !
dead body !
i think i &apos;m into your mother .
so this can &apos;t be worse .
thank you , jessica , i got it from here .
all right .
this thanksgiving ,
i want to honor the traditions of our forefathers .
the mighty pilgrims and native americans
who came together in order to survive .
sure , yeah .
the first chapter in a proud history of cooperation .
it &apos;ll be the ultimate test of manhood
and our survival skills .
it will ?
how &apos;s this for a test of our manhood ?
we stay at home ,
we drink beer , we watch football .
manhood .
i like that idea .
winston , i &apos;m talking about real men .
me , too .
men who fend for themselves .
you &apos;re the laziest man i know .
okay , jess , be honest with me .
has he ever been on top ?
real men are on the bottom .
no , they &apos;re not .
you &apos;re on the bottom ...
guys , guys .
it &apos;s thanksgiving .
we need to be together .
who &apos;s in ?
come on , guys !
all right , i &apos;m in .
what ?
yeah , schmidt !
yes !
look , my parents were super divorced
and they never took me camping ,
but i always thought that i &apos;d be incredible at it .
let &apos;s get ready .
what the hell is on your head , schmidt ?
it &apos;s an exact replica of the hat
viggo mortensen wore in hidalgo .
knew you &apos;d like it .
wow !
nice job , miller !
this spot &apos;s beautiful .
i know .
cece !
cece &apos;s here ?
i didn &apos;t know she was gonna be here .
yay , i &apos;m so happy you came !
we &apos;re all together !
it makes me so excited .
of course !
i mean , what could be better
than camping in the woods with my ex @-@ boyfriend
and his friend i just made out with .
with whom you just made out .
don &apos;t . you know i hate that .
don &apos;t .
grammar &apos;s important .
seriously , don &apos;t .
if it get awkward , i &apos;ll come save you .
happy thanksgiving !
hey , what &apos;s up , girl ?
hey , cece .
hey , i never , uh ...
had a chance to ask you .
how did the , um ...
how &apos;d your guys &apos; date go the other night ?
oh , with cece ?
yeah .
uh ... it was ... i loved it .
i mean , it was good .
it was cool .
that &apos;s great .
super .
super @-@ duper .
so where you thinking about pitching , uh , pitching a tent ?
thinking over there .
oh , yonder ? sure .
yonder .
listen , i &apos;ve been researching on the internet
for the past 12 hours
everything there is to know about the wood .
now i &apos;m a ... i &apos;m a master camper .
so if you need any help with anything ,
just come to me and ask , okay ?
thanks , man .
i don &apos;t know anything about the wood .
i know everything .
i &apos;m lost .
what is that , a tree ?
if these trees were skyscrapers ,
you &apos;d feel very comfortable .
yeah .
i &apos;d be right at home . unfortunately ,
they &apos;re actual trees .
you &apos;re the best .
i love the hat !
i &apos;m sorry , is that a solar cell phone charger ?
yeah , i can &apos;t go more than two days without it .
okay , hold on . do you ... do you hate camping , too ?
are you kidding me ? i absolutely hate camping .
then why are we here ?
because i didn &apos;t get a say . i never get a say .
whenever i want to do something , they don &apos;t give a hoot .
guess who just got free passes to a pottery seminar .
get out of here .
winston !
we could &apos;ve made the craziest mugs , man .
hey , nick ?
yeah .
there &apos;s just beer in here .
that should last us for the first few hours , actually .
where &apos;s the food ?
where ... where are all the pies i made ?
look , don &apos;t worry , jess .
&apos;cause the food is ... right here .
i &apos;m ... sorry . i don &apos;t understand that gesture .
we &apos;re gonna be hunting and foraging for our dinner ,
just like the indians and the pilgrims .
but you brought beer .
you can &apos;t forage for beer . and that &apos;s a necessity .
so this is thanksgiving meal ?
96 warm beers ?
we can do this .
guys , we &apos;ve gotten soft !
with our antibiotics and our sports creams .
do you think george washington had a pet cat ?
yeah .
no . he didn &apos;t .
he hunted them .
what ?
and he made milk and butter out of their spoils .
that &apos;s terrible .
so you &apos;re saying george washington milked his cat ?
nothing is sounding accurate right now .
not at all .
where &apos;d you read this ?
i &apos;m not saying it &apos;s gonna be easy .
it &apos;s gonna be hard .
but we will emerge out of this
better friends and a tribe .
i &apos;m on board .
going old @-@ school .
men ! killing ! hunting ! men !
men ! men ! men ! men !
oh , my cowman &apos;s ... my cowman ...
my cowman &apos;s hat , my cowman &apos;s hat .
guys , look ,
i &apos;m as much a man as anybody here ,
but this plan is straight @-@ up dookie .
i need my sweets and i need my parade .
yeah , you know what ? i &apos;m out , too .
guys , guys , guys . look .
we &apos;re together .
we &apos;re a family .
it &apos;s thanksgiving .
and i &apos;m sure nick has a plan . right ?
oh , yeah . i &apos;ve got a plan .
great .
you got a plan ?
the man &apos;s got a plan .
these wilderness guides right here detail what plants
are safe for eating and what traps we can build .
unfortunately , i ran out of money ,
so i couldn &apos;t print out the chapters
on gutting and skinning , but ...
we &apos;ll worry about that when we get there .
pilgrim rules .
men , hunters !
women , foragers .
i &apos;m not hunting . the only hunt i want
is bonnie or helen .
虽然都姓hunt 但没有亲戚关系
you know what i &apos;m talking about , coach .
what ?
nick .
this is perfect . primal man in nature .
stalking prey . who &apos;s basically the lady now , coach ?
i &apos;ve seen that tree six times in the past 20 minutes .
we &apos;re definitely moving in a small circle .
here &apos;s what i &apos;m gonna do . i &apos;m gonna clear a path this way .
we will travel northbound , i believe .
that &apos;s not north , that &apos;s south .
that is south ? then let &apos;s travel southbound .
i &apos;m gonna clear a path . if something &apos;s in there
and you get injured , i promise you i will kill you fast .
scat ! scat .
there &apos;s an animal nearby .
hey , schmidt , that &apos;s a raisin , man .
that &apos;s not a raisin . this is scat .
okay .
that &apos;s poop for sure .
i was right . in your face , nick .
in your face , nick .
how so ?
i don &apos;t know , he put a ... put a turd in his mouth .
and that &apos;s in my face ? so that &apos;s ...
yeah .
i don &apos;t think we should start eating poo yet , schmidt .
let &apos;s wait on that .
you want to chase that with some dirt ?
does anyone have any gum ?
no .
not that i wanted any in the first place .
that &apos;s a mighty big hole there , nick .
you trying to catch a refrigerator ?
it &apos;s a bear hole .
bear falls in , other stuff falls in .
we take what the bear doesn &apos;t want .
makes sense .
classic human / bear team @-@ up .
i &apos;m from chicago . it &apos;s the best i can do .
yeah , bears love to share .
what are you planning on doing with
that bear when he falls into the hole ?
dude , i &apos;m trying the best that i can !
we have no food .
let me explain something to you , nick .
when you &apos;re building a trap ,
you want to customize it to your prey .
so , i don &apos;t know , if i was
trying to catch , say a squirrel ,
i &apos;d want to think like a squirrel .
allow me to demonstrate with this trap that i built .
how do you get into the mindset of a squirrel ?
i &apos;m a squirrel ... right ?
you do that really well .
look at this !
oh , there &apos;s some nuts here .
look at all these little nuts .
you might not want to do that .
if i needed your advice on how to lead a spinning class ,
i &apos;d ask you , but this is my territory .
my scapula !
dude , are you all right ?
aah ! aah , get it off ! aah !
get it !
get up . keep breathing , man .
i don &apos;t mean to be laughing ,
but are you okay ?
i &apos;m gonna make you a sling .
you &apos;re gonna make me a what ?
you don &apos;t know how to do that .
a sling .
of course i do .
what ... ? what are you doing ?
i was an eagle scout .
what are you talking about , you were an eagle scout ?
look .
that &apos;s actually really good .
i &apos;m sorry , dude . you wanted to be the best at camping .
you were so excited about your hat .
i didn &apos;t want to get in the way of that .
plus with the whole cece thing or whatever .
what are you talking about ?
you &apos;re gonna let me be the best camper .
i am the best camper !
yeah .
i think this is chicory .
it says you can eat the root .
or it &apos;s jasmine .
which will kill you .
hmm . what do you guys think ?
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s fine .
yeah , just eat it .
hey , raspberries !
there ... ow !
there are a lot of brambles in here .
there &apos;s a country store not far from here .
three and a half stars . the reviews say ,
&quot; it &apos;s functional and dusty . &quot;
sounds good to me .
this is so fun . who wants to help ?
this plan is officially the worst .
we are starving .
just admit , you don &apos;t want to do this , either .
okay , listen up .
only stuff we can find in the forest , right ?
look at that fish .
it &apos;s perfect .
what ? oh ,
i &apos;m gonna grab it .
i &apos;m so hungry . now we get to eat , boys .
dude , that looks dead .
guys , stop being negative right now .
laying on its side means it &apos;s dead .
i wouldn &apos;t get in that water , man .
you &apos;re gonna get beaver fever .
where are my testicles now , coach ?
when he catches that little critter ,
i &apos;m gonna show you how to scale it .
that hurts ?
yeah , it hurts !
a boulder fell on my ...
is all this &apos; cause i teased you about the invite ?
yes , it is ! no regrets !
aw ! aw , come on , nick .
yes !
quit it .
you guys might be right ! it might be dead !
in fact , it was dead !
smells fresh ... enough !
oh , come on , winston , what ?
you just get your nails done ? get the apple dirty !
grind some dirt in it , grind some dirt in it .
god , i &apos;m so hungry !
hey , hey !
hey . look what the men brought .
oh , hey ! hey , hey !
the plan worked .
hey , he looks like a fighter .
he really was , kind of .
oh , my god !
wow .
i mean , well ...
whoa .
like a smorgasbord .
you guys did great .
yeah , we did .
yep .
where &apos;d you get the cashews ?
um , on a bush .
yeah .
how about the beets ?
also a bush .
that &apos;s right .
yeah .
the avocado ?
also on a bush .
that &apos;s right .
well , look at us . living off the land ,
fending for ourselves .
we got fish and fruits ,
and this is probably gonna be the most delicious apple
i &apos;ve ever eaten in my life .
&quot; product of oregon &quot; ?
we walked to oregon ?
what ?
what ?
that &apos;s why this cramp ...
yeah ...
this place ...
come on , you think the three of us are true dumb @-@ asses ?
we &apos;re not . i kind of knew from the beginning .
i mean , there &apos;s no way .
you just went to a store and got all this ?
i think so .
i think they definitely bought everything from the store .
the one thing i wanted
was for us all to sit down together and have dinner ,
and you can &apos;t do that without dinner .
we have dinner .
that fish kind of looks like hippo meat .
come on , man .
let &apos;s just sit down
and eat some delicious almonds .
and enjoy ourselves .
yes .
and have a really nice thanksgiving together .
come on , nick , let &apos;s eat .
come on , man , let &apos;s eat .
i feel like how they must &apos;ve felt on the first thanksgiving .
betrayed .
nick
what ?
happy thanksgiving .
oh , come on . nick , come on !
don &apos;t do this .
fyi , the first thanksgiving was the good one .
come on , nick !
these avocados were expensive !
here we go .
it smells so good .
i can &apos;t wait till it &apos;s ready .
i &apos;m gonna be so stuffed .
the eyeball fell off .
that &apos;s how you know it &apos;s good .
they got to pop out when it &apos;s ready , i think .
now that the cards are finally on the table ,
i guess we can see who the true camp master really is .
the answer &apos;s me .
first one to make a flame wins .
let &apos;s do this .
now , check this out .
this is how you make a flame .
you go with two rocks . one against the other .
you create friction .
i &apos;m done .
what ?
i &apos;m done .
well , that &apos;s barely a flame , it &apos;s going out .
whoa ! well , goodness gracious ! what are you ? a sorcerer ?
damn it !
hey , mountain man .
you want to come eat some dirty vegetables with us ?
i should &apos;ve known those beets weren &apos;t from nature .
nothing purple grows in nature .
look , we didn &apos;t come through , okay ?
you came through !
look , you caught a fish !
that &apos;s really , really impressive .
how &apos;d you do it ?
with my bare hands .
no way ! you &apos;re so strong .
yeah .
yeah , it was ... it fought ...
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m not doing anything . i think that &apos;s amazing .
you provided for us .
you &apos;re a man .
don &apos;t patronize me , jess .
i &apos;m not .
ever since we started dating , jess ,
we &apos;ve been doing a bunch of girly stuff ,
and i like some of it and you , but ...
my tolerance to alcohol has , like ,
gotten really , scary low .
i drank three beers , and i got ,
like , all giggly and tired .
and i didn &apos;t want a fourth .
last night , i had a dream that i was brushing a horse .
i just feel like i &apos;m losing myself a little .
just ...
let me eat this disgusting fish and ...
no , nick , nick .
yeah , just let me be over here .
this is the most beautiful fish i &apos;ve ever seen .
don &apos;t touch ... i wouldn &apos;t touch it .
it is ! it is .
jess , don &apos;t ... don &apos;t put your hands in ...
oh , my lo ...
spit it out .
fragrant .
mmm , i can really ... i can really taste the lake .
spit it out .
i feel like i &apos;m there in the lake with the fish .
bony .
that &apos;s gonna hurt going down .
but i like it .
hurts so good ! hurts so good !
jess , that fish was dead when i caught it .
there was a sock near it .
i &apos;m gonna come with you .

don &apos;t let them pay the bill , okay ?
you bring the check to me .
no arguments , moon man .
oh , my god !
is anyone hurt ?
we &apos;re fine . i may have cracked a few ribs ,
and , uh , jess is delirious .
i think she thinks she &apos;s a rabbit .
guys , we &apos;re gonna figure something out , all right ?
just get us a rope or a stick or something .
all right , man , so , any ideas ?
what are you talk ... ?
you know what , coach ? don &apos;t humor me .
what ?
you know what to do .
look , i admit it . you &apos;re a better camper than i am .
you &apos;re better at life than i am .
you &apos;re probably better at dating cece than i am .
i saw you guys the other night
inhaling each other in front of the loft .
schmidt , that &apos;s all we did . that was it .
i asked her to come upstairs , she said no , okay ?
and now she won &apos;t return any of my text messages .
she &apos;s been ignoring me this whole trip .
i &apos;m all , like , &quot; hey . &quot; she &apos;s like , &quot; mm @-@ hmm . &quot;
i &apos;m like , &quot; what ? &quot;
why are you smiling , dude ?
i &apos;m not smiling .
i &apos;m over here baring my soul to you , dude ,
and you &apos;re freaking smiling in my face . yeah .
this is the face i make when i listen .
all your teeth show when you listen ?
i &apos;m not .
you &apos;re smiling right now . i opened up to you .
you &apos;re pissing me off . stop smiling .
i &apos;m not .
i will wreck you . you &apos;re crazy , man .
you &apos;re nuts .
stop it , listen to me .
we are going to solve this right now .
all right , take your pants off .
okay , i am no eagle scout ,
but i know how to make a pants rope .
pants rope .
you &apos;re a genius .
i know .
okay .
are you gonna take off your pants ?
yeah , right after i take off
my bra so we can anchor the rope to the tree .
that &apos;s gonna happen for real ?
just take them off now .
whoa , look at winston &apos;s pants .
it &apos;s got kittens on it .
these aren &apos;t kittens .
i cannot believe i &apos;m here voluntarily .
so stupid .
take them off .
they &apos;re coming off .
here , you guys , grab hold of the rope .
okay , you go first , jess .
i &apos;ll be right behind you to support you .

let &apos;s go .
you got it ,
you got it .
you got it , you ...
you chubby son of a bitch .
yeah .
you okay , jess , you all right ?
thanks for saving me , mountain man .
so i &apos;ve got good news from the doctor
you don &apos;t have rabies .
you have , uh , giardia
and something called legionnaires &apos; disease .
i &apos;m just glad they were able to save your foot .
what ?
no , nothing .
never mind .
hey , i &apos;m sorry about the whole camping thing .
oh , no , it &apos;s okay .
ah , i was really stupid .
i haven &apos;t been myself .
you &apos;re the man i want .
all you wanted was for everyone
to be together on thanksgiving , jess .
next year .
potato chips .
chips ?
maybe a treat .
listen , coach , uh , in the spirit of thanksgiving ,
i thought maybe that i could give you
some advice about ... about cece .
how desperate do you think i am ?
i think you &apos;re probably very desperate .
i &apos;m very desperate , i mean ,
she &apos;s giving me nothing .
told her she looked pretty , she said thanks .
mm @-@ hmm . what kind of mind game is that ?
look , coach , things have always come easy to you .
cece is not going to be one of those things .
i once spent hours in a car
with just a cracked window for air .
she was going into a club
and she just kind of left me there .
why are you smiling about that ?
hey , guys , i figured out a way to save thanksgiving .
i got a plan .
enough with the plans .
you suck at plans !
not another nick miller plan .
i love you , man , but you are terrible at plans .
it &apos;s still 11 : 48 , so happy thanksgiving .
what ?
got us some brazilian nuts ,
a couple of string cheeses , and snack .
thank you .
i got the parade on my phone .
yes .
made some decorations .
i think this may be a turkey sandwich ,
but i &apos;m not sure ,
and i know this whole thing isn &apos;t ...
it &apos;s perfect .
look , guys , start without me
because it might be a few weeks before i can eat again .
you were throwing up a lot .
that was scary ... seriously .
okay , i &apos;m starving actually . let &apos;s eat .
yeah , let &apos;s eat .
nick found all this food in the woods .
can i have the ginger ale ?
yeah , nick found that . it &apos;s already open .
