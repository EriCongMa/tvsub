um , do you want to just stay in ?
&apos;cause you know what that means .
romantic dinner and homeland ?
sex on the couch .
or your thing .
actually , homeland sounds great .
or your thing .
hey , nick , um ...
last night when furguson and i were in the shower ,
i had an epiphany .
it &apos;s time to get back in the game .
you know , meet some women .
human women .
human ? is there any other kind ?
human .
anyway , i was wondering if you &apos;d watch furguson tonight
while i go out for some drinks with some work buddies .
just for a little while . you just gotta give him a pill at 6 : 00 .
we &apos;re having date night tonight .
jess ...
winston wants to go out to meet human women .
without the cat .
oh , yep , yep .
yep , yep . nick will watch the cat .
question , are those mouth pills or butt pills ?
just one pill .
just one butt pill .
here you are .
nah , i &apos;m not touching that thing .
no ? okay .
thanks , man .
yeah . you got it .
hey , guys . just hanging at home tonight ?
no , actually , we have a date tonight .
&apos;cause i just made some cobbler .
some peach cobbler
and slow @-@ churned vanilla bean ice cream ,
and coach is asking cece out on a date tonight , and ...
does anybody want a bite of this , &apos; cause it &apos;s ... ?
it &apos;s fresh out of the oven .
it &apos;s piping hot !
well , i hope coach at least ran this by you first .
coach came over , he followed the bro code .
actually went really well .
yeah . just the man i wanted to see .
you found me .
yeah , i did .
i got a question for you , playa .
drop the bomb , man !
can i ask cece out on a date ?
yeah ! wait , what ?
wait , that &apos;s so great for cece . coach is super hot .
wrong crowd .
i see that now .
be that as it may , you blew it with cece ,
so you have to be fine with this .
i am .
you are ?
i promise i am .
you are ?
100 % fine .
you &apos;re fine ?
yeah , i &apos;m absolutely fine .
really ?
it &apos;s good for cece , it &apos;s good for coach , it &apos;s good for america .
who knows ? we might even get another tiger woods out of this situation .
wouldn &apos;t that be nice ?
i &apos;m probably getting ahead of myself .
who knows if cece will even say yes ?
she said yes !
we &apos;re going to the staples center to watch a game tonight .
are you still ... are you cool with this ?
i mean , &apos; cause all you have to do is say the word , man ,
and i &apos;ll back off , for real .
n ... no , man .
come on . date that thing .
yeah ! all right !
yeah ! and then date it again .
it &apos;s not gonna date itself .
yeah , date it all night long .
i &apos;m kind of nervous !
yeah , i &apos;m nervous .
yeah , i &apos;m really nervous . um ...
i mean , she &apos;s beautiful and she &apos;s super cool .
and it &apos;s just , like ... like , you don &apos;t even know .
i 100 % know .
yes , you kno ... you know .
she stopped the wedding because of me , so i &apos;m just saying .
and then i ruined it &apos; cause i had my own thing .
malia broke up with me and that kind of ,
like , threw my head for a loop ,
so i &apos;m super vulnerable right now .
oh , wait . don &apos;t @-@ don &apos;t worry .
it &apos;s like ... i don &apos;t know .
think i &apos;m feeling kind of insecure .
come on . you &apos;re coach .
you &apos;re the coach .
yeah .
you &apos;re the prize . remember , you &apos;re the prize .
you &apos;re the prize .
i &apos;m coach !
yeah , you &apos;re coach .
she doesn &apos;t stand a chance !
oh , yeah , well ...
she &apos;s gonna get it good !
yeah ! or you could take it slow !
nah , i &apos;m gunning it !
oh , oh ! y @-@ you &apos;re gonna gun it .
i am gunning it . yes .
you &apos;re gonna gun it for real ?
that first @-@ class ass is sitting in coach tonight .
and best believe , my seat will be in an upright and locked position .
thanks , schmidt .
oh ... boy .
he &apos;s gonna gun it .
i don &apos;t know if you heard that ,
but he said he &apos;s going to gun it .
he &apos;s really not fine .
when he says ,
&quot; i &apos;m fine , &quot; he &apos;s about to get un @-@ fine .
aw , schmidters .
there &apos;s gonna be other open mics with sturdier stools .
i &apos;m fine .
i know you &apos;re fine .
then they &apos;ll see your rap skills . then ...
hey . stop ! you just said you were fine !
you just said you were fine !
let me die !
i know schmidt .
he &apos;s gonna try and stop that date from happening .
okay .
so the strategy is containment .
okay .
okay ? we got to lock him up .
distract him like a baby .
if he gets out of line , we got to get physical .
we &apos;re gonna get physical with a baby ?
please don &apos;t question me . i &apos;m a pro .
or we could help him move on .
take him out , get him drunk , maybe meet someone new ?
no . we just got to keep him in a safe place .
i wish i had that dog cage .
what ?
when you see a dog cage for sale , you buy it .
hey , jess , about tonight , i &apos;m so sorry .
yeah . no , it &apos;s okay .

did you get a chance to get that , uh ... the dog cage ?
no . i feel bad .
