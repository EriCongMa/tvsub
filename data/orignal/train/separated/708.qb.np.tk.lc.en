let &apos;s go through this again .
he shot up . he collapsed ,
breaking his neck when he fell .
you &apos;ve hit rock bottom .
only you can pull yourself out .
i &apos;m checking myself into rehab .
there &apos;s something i need to tell you about emily .
the guy that charlotte killed had this .
there &apos;s more to my father &apos;s story than he &apos;s admitting .
oh , hi , daniel .
my partner didn &apos;t show ,
and your new client just joined the club .
louise ellis is mentally imbalanced .
i left the responsibility
of my daughter &apos;s future in your hands .
and you stole her inheritance .
how could you believe i would do something like that ...
you &apos;re breaking into mostrowski &apos;s garage ?
i spoke with some of the neighbors .
they told me that they saw someone
coming and going over the last several months .
if you &apos;re not gonna give this up ,
i guess i &apos;m just gonna have to join you .
i think my father
went to great lengths to stage this place .
if he &apos;s lying about that ,
then he is lying about everything .
hey , is everything okay ?
i thought i heard something .
it was probably just the wind .
let &apos;s go back to bed .
emily ?
hey . sorry i called so late .
couldn &apos;t sleep ?
me neither .
in light of what your father did to me ,
i think my r.e.m. cycle is permanently screwed .
look , i know this has been hard .
thanks for picking up the phone .
what good is an insomniac bestie
if not for midnight house calls ?
how can i be of service ?
i want you to hack into the police file on conrad &apos;s murder .
because you need some light reading ?
because i need to know if this matches the description
of the suspected murder weapon .
where did you get that ?
i snuck into the beach house tonight .
it was in my old hiding spot .
guess my father and i still have something in common .
you think your father is lying about the silo , and your first moveis a b &amp; e ?
ems , what if he had caught you ?
look , i had to do something , but you &apos;re missing the point .
you believe your father murdered conrad grayson ?
he had more motive than anyone .
and why else would he set up elaborate lie ? the silo is his alibi .
ems , ems ...
if you &apos;re right , this is ...
it &apos;s huge .
i wonder if my father came back six months ago to kill conrad ,
then where was he the twelve years before that ?
something had to have kept him away .
maybe this will show us some light .
this key was beside the knife .
you think you find the lock ?
it won &apos;t be easy .
is it ever ?
hey , good morning .
uh , your office sent these over
with a note of congratulations .
i knew the david clarke story would be huge ,
but then to get this nolan ross angle ?
it &apos;s like digging for oil
and finding gold on the way down .
and who knew he cheated amanda out of all that money .
yeah , go figure .
are you okay ?
i didn &apos;t even hear you come to bed last night .
yeah , just a busy day ahead , you know ?
potential client meetings -- that &apos;s all .
well , at least you &apos;ll get a break from louise .
she and i are playing tennis again this afternoon .
well , i &apos;m not sure that &apos;s a good idea .
i mean , h @-@ have you looked outside ?
the storm clouds are moving in .
are you worried about me becoming friends with her ?
no , no , it &apos;s not that .
i mean , i &apos;m actually ...
i &apos;m actually reconsidering working with louise .
yeah , she seems a little ... a little unstable .
mm . but you know what else she is ?
connected .
we &apos;re playing doubles with her lobbyist cousin
and his friend from the fcc .
it might be good for business .
daniel , don &apos;t be so worried .
i &apos;m sure she &apos;s harmless .
where did you see this ?
i was at a wake for the guy who happened to be
the prison guard who beat conrad up .
that was carved into a beam in his garage .
now , i know it wasn &apos;t you .
and your father was locked up in that silo .
right ?
why were you looking in this guy &apos;s garage in the first place ?
it &apos;s ben .
he &apos;s hell @-@ bent on finding conrad &apos;s killer ,
and he knows the case inside and out ,
which means i &apos;m already playing catch @-@ up .
emily , what are you not telling me ?
the things you told me you didn &apos;t want to hear .
hey , porter , you have a visitor .
and if that &apos;s a personal call ,
we need to go over the difference
between a station house and a clubhouse .
emily , i got to go .
ms. thorne ?
it &apos;s my duty to inform you you &apos;re contributing
to officer porter &apos;s dereliction of duty .
hello ?
david ?
what brings you around ?
well , i just wanted to apologize in case i offended you .
i don &apos;t know if you saw my television interview .
i think everyone did .
yeah , well , i realized that i talked a lot
about what amanda didn &apos;t have
and neglected to mention what she did .
you gave her a good life , jack ,
and i &apos;m grateful for it .
i &apos;m sorry that i didn &apos;t acknowledge that last night .
i appreciate that , but ...
i think you might be apologizing to the wrong person .
what do you mean ?
you humiliated nolan ross on live tv .
yeah . he deserved it .
amanda should have had so much more , and she didn &apos;t .
the world needed to know that it was because of him .
all due respect , i wish you &apos;d come to me .
&apos;cause i would have told you that nolan was the one
who opened his doors to amanda when she first came to town .
despite what you think , he was a great friend to her .
yeah , well ...
he was probably trying to ease his guilt .
no , david , no . he wasn &apos;t .
they really cared about each other .
that &apos;s why she asked him to officiate her wedding .
nothing meant more to amanda than her friends .
that shows how little i really know .
who else was amanda close to ?
daniel !
is everything okay ?
is david here ?
no , he &apos;s not .
good , because a little birdie named charlotte clarke
had quite a bit to say before leaving town .
hey , let &apos;s just start with the bombshell
that emily is her sister .
a fact that everyone seemed to know
except for her dear old dad and me .
now , why do you think that is ?
i have my reasons .
right , of course ,
which i imagine have something to do
with you waging a campaign
to destroy david &apos;s opinion of emily .
what ? you think i &apos;d mess that up ?
quite frankly , yes .
but more importantly ,
i wanted to leave you out of this .
now , only you could frame lying to me as a kindness .
tell me , what &apos;s your plan when emily comes forward
to dispute everything you &apos;ve said ?
the truth is not on her side .
ha . the truth ?
no , the truth is you betrayed david clarke .
aren &apos;t you terrified he &apos;ll find out ?
emily &apos;s unsupportable claims
are that of a 9 @-@ year @-@ old child !
after everything she &apos;s done to you ,
i would think you would applaud my efforts .
i &apos;m telling you right now
there is no way this ends well for you .
and i am not about to get caught in the crossfire .
i &apos;m walking away .
and if you &apos;re smart , you &apos;ll do the same .
if you &apos;re worried about collateral damage ,
you &apos;re talking to the wrong side ,
because when your ex @-@ wife finally goes down ,
she will find a way to drag you with her .
not if i find her first .
emily thorne ?
i &apos;m david clarke .
i thought it was time we met .
第四季第七集
i &apos;ve been trying to learn about amanda .
but the more i hear , the less familiar she feels .
so why come to me ?
well , you &apos;re carl &apos;s godmother .
jack porter said that you and amanda were close .
we were best friends .
i would have done anything for her ,
despite what you may have heard from other people .
amanda knew how much you cared about her .
i know for a fact
that she never stopped thinking about you .
wasn &apos;t a day in that silo
that i didn &apos;t wish i could see her ,
even for a moment .
being free now , it &apos;s like a miracle .
well , i was just on my way out .
was there anything specific you wanted to ask me ?
i &apos;m not sure .
i didn &apos;t realize that my daughter had such good friends .
victoria said that amanda was a little lost .
i wouldn &apos;t consider her a credible witness .
i know you both have a history .
but she did spend time with amanda , right ?
oh , victoria
did host a baby shower for her , but ...
but what ?
i don &apos;t know exactly what went on .
they were upstairs .
we heard shouting and
next thing we knew , amanda was
lying on the ground in a pool of blood .
what ? what are you saying ?
did victoria hurt her ?
i &apos;m just telling you what happened .
well , i should let you go .
thank you for speaking to me .
anytime .
i saw everything .
he didn &apos;t even recognize me , nolan .
how could he not know who i am ?
because if i &apos;ve learned anything in the last 24 hours ,
it &apos;s that this david clarke
is not the man we once knew .
i was this close to telling him who i am .
and he lied to my face .
i &apos;m sorry .
all of this time i have spent honoring his memory ,
and he doesn &apos;t even have one of me ?
who the hell is he , nolan ?
it &apos;s time we find out .
and here is our first step .
i traced the key that you gave me
to a safety @-@ deposit box at first federal in manhattan .
this is the bank &apos;s master key ,
courtesy of your 3d printer , my 5d intellect .
i &apos;m downloading their security protocols as we speak .
are you sure you still want to do the other thing ?
i &apos;ve fought for this long . i &apos;m not stopping now .
wait , wait , wait . don &apos;t go out your front door .
why not ?
my twitter feed says there &apos;s a news van on the way ,
and a helicopter will be arriving
in five , four , three , two ...
last night &apos;s debacle threw me into a media feeding frenzy .
i thought i was safe here , but it seems not ,
so time to find another batcave .
you went to see emily thorne ?
apparently , she and my daughter were close .
did you know that ?
one friendship doesn &apos;t discount
everything she tried to do to destroy my family .
we all felt for amanda ,
given the difficult life she had , david .
you know , i may have been rash
to blame nolan for everything .
what do you mean ?
after my arrest , you had money .
why didn &apos;t you help her ?
conrad and his associates were watching my every move .
i can only imagine what they would have done
to amanda if i &apos;d helped her .
david , my hands were tied , but you have to know
that when she returned to the hamptons
i was there for her .
were you ?
at amanda &apos;s baby shower ,
emily said that you two had an argument .
what was the fight about ?
you , actually .
i learned that you had left her some journals ,
and i was hoping to read them .
it was a foolish attempt to feel closer to you .
but what about the fall ?
it was an accident , and a horrible one .
anyone there could tell you the same ,
except emily , of course .
who else was there ?
my friends from the hamptons , amanda &apos;s from work .
i wonder what they might say .
david , if you go down that road ,
it &apos;ll only depress you .
you have to know i tried to do
everything i could for amanda .
you know , i think my cousin was kind of sweet on you .
he was just helping me with my backhand .
well , it &apos;s always good to have options .
unless things are heating up with danny .
oh , i &apos;m sorry . is that too personal ?
no .
no , we just like to keep our relationship quiet .
well , i am the most discreet person i know .
so just between us chickens , is it serious ?
well , time will tell . but things are good .
well , you know what they say ?
&quot; marry the man , marry his mama . &quot;
do you like victoria ?
well , she can be tough ,
but she has a love for her children that i really admire .
sure , but will that love extend to you ?
i mean , it would be terrible
if she saw you as an interloper .
she was the last woman my father ever loved .
so regardless of what happens with daniel ,
she and i will be bonded forever .
well , sounds like everything &apos;s perfect , then .
oh , i just remembered i have an appointment .
if my head wasn &apos;t attached , right ?
bye .
you &apos;re just gonna walk away and let her win ?
i did not raise a quitter .
i &apos;m not quitting .
i just need time to--
regroup ?
that is why i sent you to claremont ,
but you got yourself out .
now look at you .
darling , i have always said
you do not have the face to pull of an updo .
but that margaux ,
she &apos;s smart , sophisticated , accomplished .
everything you &apos;re not .
no wonder the graysons prefer her to you .
you &apos;re right . giving up is for the best .
there .
how &apos;s that ?
are you happy , mother ?
are you ? !
hey !
hey , somebody let me out !
help !
just please let me out !
oh , my god ! are you okay ? !
what happened ? somebody call a doctor !
right away .
victoria , i &apos;m so glad you came by .
it killed me to learn that my possessions had been auctioned off .
but when i came to learn
that you bought the lion &apos;s share ,
well , it , it softened the blow .
you know , i &apos;ve always envied your taste .
did you buy my kensington horse sculpture ?
i don &apos;t see it .
right over there .
full of life , as i always remember .
this lemon curd , it &apos;s simply delicious .
would you mind if i had a touch more ?
anything for you , victoria .
unacceptable . sir , i could have died in there .
ms. lemarchal , i &apos;ve owned this place for 11 years ,
and nothing like this has ever happened .
the door &apos;s never locked .
for obvious reasons .
this is gross negligence ,
and i &apos;m fully prepared to file a lawsuit .
bad day , margaux ?
i am not in the mood .
you know what i wasn &apos;t in the mood for ?
humiliation on live tv .
watch out for this one . she can be sneaky .
nolan , i had no idea david was bringing you into it .
well , looks like karma found you fast .
and she can be such a bitch .
on behalf of the club , my sincerest apologies .
sir , i don &apos;t want your apology ! i want an explanation !
the lock isn &apos;t even active .
a @-@ and the only way to reactivate it
is a switch on the door frame ,
but then the hole is so tiny
it would take a @-@ a pin to engage it .
you &apos;re working out of the beach club ? you hate that place .
i used to , but , uh ,
membership has its privileges -- no press , no tv , and
i think i may have developed an interest in yachting .
you know the plan , right ?
yes , i head into the bank , go up to the fourth @-@ floor vault ,
find box 24559,
take what i need , and get out .
piece of cake .
do you remember the dicey part ?
at exactly 4 : 30 p.m. ,
i turn off the power to the entire floor ,
and with the power go the security cameras .
how is that dicey ?
because it only buys you a seven @-@ minute window of time
before the backup system overrides me .
so when your watch says 4 : 30,
your ass better be on the fourth floor .
i got it , nolan .
ems ...
good luck .
i really hope you find the answers we &apos;re looking for .
oh , the fourth floor . me too .
you &apos;re not the only one
who can track someone down in an elevator .
there &apos;s no way you tracked me down on your own .
uh , i &apos;ve got a guy .
and considering i &apos;m standing here right now ,
you got to admit he &apos;s pretty good .
i don &apos;t have time for this .
i think you do .
push that , i tell everyone your little secret .
and i &apos;m guessing you don &apos;t want that ,
do you , amanda ?
so , who told you ?
your little sister , who &apos;s also my little sister ,
which makes this whole thing a little weird .
i don &apos;t have to explain anything to you .
i &apos;m not asking you to .
oh , you didn &apos;t see that coming , did you ?
yeah , i thought about crushing you ,
but these days ... not my style .
so why are you here ?
because in this nuclear war you have with my mother ,
the blast zone keeps getting bigger and bigger ,
and i want no part of it .
so while you &apos;re both busy plotting
to make each other &apos;s lives hell --
you &apos;re wasting my time .
one call to margaux , and it &apos;s over .
i will break you in half .
no , you won &apos;t .
one , there &apos;s a security camera .
and two , you &apos;ve come too far to throw it all away over me .
so what do you want ?
your assurance that , when this thing with your dad explodes ,
none of it lands on me .
and why should i do you any favors ?
&quot; cause i &apos;m trying to separate myself from my family &apos;s sins ,
and i would think that you of all people
would understand what it means to be defined by them .
so keep you out of it , that &apos;s all you want ?
that &apos;s all i want .
done . you won &apos;t even cross my mind .
well , that &apos;s wonderful .
unbelievable .
tell me something . how are things with you and emily ?
last i heard , you were trying to un @-@ complicate .
so what are we , on a sleepover ?
are we gonna do each other &apos;s hair next ?
just making conversation .
unless you want me to give me highlights .
we &apos;re working on it .
well , my two cents -- you should stop calling her
during the day ... or at night .
&quot; cause this last time , i &apos;m pretty sure she hung up on you .
i think it &apos;s safe to say
somebody &apos;s not doing so well in there .
hello ?
anybody home ?
super &apos;s not answering .
do the honors .
i &apos;ll call it in .
this is unit 984 .
we &apos;re on that maple street apartment call .
984 , go ahead .
yeah , yeah , we just found a body .
possible o.d.
all right .
they &apos;re sending an m.e. over now .
this guy had the makings for the world &apos;s creepiest scrapbook .
grayson &apos;s arrest was a big story .
yet somehow we managed to move on .
that &apos;s a serrated clip @-@ point knife with a five @-@ inch blade .
take a wild guess as to which type of knife
is presumed to have killed conrad grayson .
i didn &apos;t know you were claustrophobic .
i &apos;m not .
want some help ?
nope .
okay , suit yourself .
well , if i knew you were that flexible ,
things might have worked out for us .
would you stop talking ?
come to think about it , there were multiple ways
you could have infiltrated my family .
but you chose me . why ?
you were expedient .
nah , there &apos;s more to it than that .
you went through great lying lengths to keep me around .
what lies ? oh , that &apos;s funny you should ask .
i didn &apos;t .
let &apos;s see .
there was the biggest lie of all -- your name .
then there was the lie about you being pregnant .
i &apos;d call that the runner @-@ up .
and then there were a thousand little lies within that .
for instance , that wine auction
where we had that really awful red .
what was your ulterior motive then ?
and here i thought you just wanted me drunk
so you could have your way with me .
was any of it real ?
nothing comes to mind .
what about when i proposed to you ?
can &apos;t tell me that you weren &apos;t with me in that moment ...
that it wasn &apos;t real .
yeah , that &apos;s what i thought .
but then you had to go and dismantle my life .
no , i didn &apos;t do that . you did that to yourself .
maybe there was a time when the feelings were real
and we could have had a real relationship ,
but the moment that you aligned yourself with your father ,
it was all over .
now , something real ?
that &apos;s what you were looking for ?
there . that was real .
margaux , hi .
no , no , i &apos;m just finishing up with a client .
what &apos;s up ?
louise tried what ?
excuse me . i &apos;m looking for crystal .
that &apos;s her .
thank you .
amanda was the best .
it seemed like her life was really coming together when she ...
we were all devastated .
and you were at amanda &apos;s baby shower ?
amanda had an argument with victoria grayson .
do you know what that was about ?
it was just a misunderstanding . they worked it out .
so victoria didn &apos;t push her off the balcony ?
oh , god , no .
amanda slipped .
doing what we do , you &apos;d think she &apos;d be better in heels .
you know mrs. grayson always looked out for amanda .
always ?
before amanda moved to the hamptons ,
mrs. grayson came by a couple times to check on her ,
offer money , but amanda refused to see her .
it &apos;s too bad because it was clear
mrs. grayson felt a responsibility
to make sure your daughter was okay .
thank you .
you &apos;ve been really helpful .
did he believe you ?
bought every word .
good girl .
hello .
so , i just spoke to margaux .
she said she got locked in the steam room .
yes , i heard there was an incident .
poor dear . is she all right ?
she &apos;s fine .
do you have any idea how that could have happened ?
oh , i don &apos;t know . uh ...
you don &apos;t believe i had something to do with this , danny ?
how could you think i &apos;d be capable of such an atrocity ?
well , you were the last one in there .
and why on earth would i want to harm you girlfriend ?
well , i could think of a couple ideas .
you don &apos;t think i &apos;m jealous , do you ?
that i &apos;d do something like this on the account of you ?
well , we did sleep together .
ah , yes .
now that you remind me , we did .
i nearly forgot . no offense .
you were much better than i imagined .
pretty boys , they don &apos;t generally try very hard .
listen , louise , to be clear , i &apos;m with margaux .
so if you were trying to get her out of the way --
okay , now who &apos;s being irrational ?
danny , weren &apos;t you already with margaux
when we slept together ?
yes . the point is , i ...
listen , it was a one @-@ time thing , all right ?
and it &apos;s gonna be kept between us .
of course , silly .
as i say to everyone ,
i am the most discreet person i know .
oh , got to run now . toodles .
men .
always thinking it &apos;s about them .
mr. ross , what can i get you ?
gin martini with a twist .
you know , there &apos;s a place right down the road
that makes a martini that will knock your socks off .
i &apos;m pretty happy here , thanks .
louise ellis .
i &apos;m -- - nolan ross . i know . i saw you on tv .
of course you did .
here you go , sir .
you got dragged through the mud a bit , huh ?
that margaux lemarchal ,
she didn &apos;t do you any favors , did she ?
are all these people tweeting about you ?
i used to be happy when i was trending .
my brother is in politics ,
so he &apos;s always dealing with the press .
one day , he &apos;s on the front page .
the next , he &apos;s yesterday &apos;s news .
so don &apos;t you worry
your pretty little highlighted head , huh ?
&apos;cause before you know it ,
people won &apos;t care one bit about you .
thanks ?
do you want to come out on my yacht ?
she loses cell service 100 yards out .
with this storm coming ? are you crazy ?
or we can fly to the bahamas .
i have a private jet on standby .
so do i.
well , then buck up , huh ?
because at the end of the day ,
you can have something that all these other people can &apos;t .
and what &apos;s that ?
anything you want .
great work out there , guys .
hey , thanks , man .
thanks .
so , you think they &apos;re gonna bring us in on it ?
i don &apos;t know .
dude , crack a smile , all right ?
we just caught the biggest break in this case to date .
i don &apos;t want to get ahead of ourselves .
it &apos;s a lead . it &apos;s far from a slam dunk .
yeah , well , it &apos;s the best lead that anyone &apos;s had yet
so ...
i will drink to that .
you coming ?
i &apos;ll be right there .
this is emily . leave a message .
hey , it &apos;s me .
so here &apos;s how my day went --
ben and i got a call out to an o.d.
where we found evidence that indicates
that this might be the guy who killed conrad grayson .
i find the timing of this to be very disconcerting ,
especially since it involves a dead body .
we need to talk .
mr. ross . it &apos;s closing time .
i thought you were open till 11 : 00 .
well , normally we are , but
this weather &apos;s turned ugly .
there are power lines down , so
we have to close up .
god , i hate it when these storms come through ,
threatening everything in their path .
yeah , seems like you had a rough day .
how much to take this club off your hands ?
are you for real ?
my last 24 hours have been remarkably awful .
and being here ,
it &apos;s the most i &apos;ve felt at peace in a long time .
now , i know you were trying to sell this place last year .
how about i offer a million above asking ?
what &apos;s the catch ?
well , you have to let me keep drinking .
what , you can stay as long as you like .
just lock up when you leave .
or don &apos;t . it &apos;s your place now .
where have you been ? i was worried about you .
i , uh ...
i went to that place that amanda used to work .
why didn &apos;t you tell me that you tried reaching out to her ?
because i failed .
and no matter what i tried ,
she refused to accept my help .
i couldn &apos;t save her in the end , so it doesn &apos;t matter .
it matters to me .
i &apos;m so sorry i ever doubted your loyalty .
david . david .
daddy , what are you doing ?
right now it all looks really bad , right ?
yeah .
but you and i , we can fix any problem .
when this is done , it &apos;s gonna be a reminder
that no mistake is ever gonna break us apart .
as long as you never forget
i love you .
here .
she denied it .
completely .
and how did she react to when you quit ?
well , for now ,
i think it &apos;s best to keep her as a client .
the woman tried to kill me .
we don &apos;t know that .
oh , i am sure that she w--
let &apos;s just say it &apos;s true .
and if i drop louise , it could provoke her .
that might put you at risk . you don &apos;t want that .
so , what is it ?
what &apos;s what ?
the leverage louise has over you .
there must be something .
w @-@ what are you talking about ?
you slept with her .
oh , don &apos;t be ridiculous . w @-@ why would i sleep with her ?
incroyable .
thank you .
are these the earrings i got you ?
i love them .
i kept them all these years ,
unaware that one day i &apos;d get to wear them for you .
i thought you lost everything .
well , i had faith that i would find the things
that mattered most .
victoria , get the hell out .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m not going anywhere .
victoria , please . it &apos;s okay .
you were right there .
what are you talking about ?
if you had come for her , i would have known .
i would have known !
you could have come for me , but you didn &apos;t .
you taught me to be strong and brave ,
but you &apos;re a coward .
you could have come for me !
let go of me !
amanda . it &apos;s you .
