and that &apos;s why , no matter what mommy says ..
we really were on a break . yes , we were .
yes , we were . come here , gorgeous .
look at you . you are the cutest little baby ever .
you &apos;re just a little @-@ bitty baby , you know that ? but you &apos;ve got ..
you &apos;ve got big , beautiful eyes .
yes , you do . and a .. and a big , round belly .
big baby butt .
i like big butts .
oh , my god , emma . you &apos;re laughing .
oh , my god . you &apos;ve never done that before , have you ?
you &apos;ve never done that before . daddy made you laugh , huh ?
well , daddy and sir mix @-@ a @-@ lot .
what ? what ? you wanna hear some more ?
i &apos;m a terrible father .
the.one.with.rosss.inappropriate.song
what do you know about investments ?
how come ?
i &apos;m starting to make good money on the show , and i should do something with it .
what do you do with your money now ?
it &apos;s taped to the back of my toilet tank .
i didn &apos;t say that . it &apos;s in a bank guarded by robots .
do you have any ideas ?
a guy at work got me excited ..
about going in on an emu farm . that &apos;d be kind of cool , huh ?
pitching in on the weekends , helping to plant the emus .
joe , emus are birds . you raise them for meat .
yeah . right !
people eat birds . bird meat .
do they just fly into your mouth ? or you go in a restaurant and say :
&quot; excuse me , i &apos;ll have a bucket of fried bird . &quot;
or maybe just a wing . or a .
you should consider something a little less risky .
i think real estate is your best investment .
the fed just lowered the rates , and the interest on your mortgage is deductible .
that &apos;s right . i know some stuff .
real estate , huh ?
and you know who &apos;s selling a great apartment ? richard !
and you know whose knowledge of her ex @-@ boyfriend is shocking ? monica !
my dad told me . they play golf together .
well , maybe i &apos;ll join them sometime .
i just hope the club doesn &apos;t slip out of my hand ..
and beat the mustache off his face .
and then the doctor said emma has doubled her birth weight ..
she is in the 90th percentile and she &apos;s gonna start eating solid foods soon .
that &apos;s great !
i know !
what did we used to talk about ?
no idea .
hi ! you have to help me pick a dress . i &apos;m meeting mike &apos;s parents tonight .
wow , the boyfriend &apos;s parents . that &apos;s a big step .
really ? that hadn &apos;t occurred to me .
they &apos;ll love you . just be yourself .
they live on the upper east side on park avenue .
yeah , she can &apos;t be herself .
okay , so , all right , which dress ?
you can say neither .
oh , god . neither .
you can say it nicely .
i &apos;m sorry . we &apos;ll take you shopping . it &apos;ll be fine .
you are in such good hands , and i am so good with meeting parents .
with the father , you wanna flirt a little , but not in a gross way .
just kind of like , &quot; mr. pinzer , i can see where wallace gets his good looks . &quot;
you went out with wallace pinzer ?
he took the sats for me .
i knew you didn &apos;t get a 1400 !
yeah , well , duh ! i mean ..
so now , what about with mike &apos;s mom ?
well , with the mother , just constantly tell her how amazing her son is .
take it from me . moms love me . ross &apos; mom one time actually said ..
i am like the daughter that she never had .
she said what ?
she &apos;s like the daughter she never had .
listen .
i just got phoebe all dressed to meet mike &apos;s parents .
she &apos;s so nervous . it &apos;s so sweet .
guess what . i made emma laugh today .
you what ? and i missed it ..
because i was giving a makeover to that stupid hippie ? !
yeah , and it was like a real little person laugh too .
it was like :
only not creepy .
what did you do to make her laugh ?
i ..
well , i sang . actually ..
i rapped ..
&quot; baby got back . &quot;
you what ?
you sang to our baby daughter ..
a song about a guy who likes to have sex ..
with women with giant asses ?
you know what , if you think about it ..
it actually promotes a healthy body image ..
because even big butts ..
or &quot; juicy doubles &quot; are ..
please don &apos;t take her away from me .
hi , come on in . i &apos;m catherine , the listing agent .
hi , i &apos;m joey . this is chandler .
so how come richard &apos;s selling the place ? went bankrupt ?
medical malpractice ? choked on his own mustache ?
he &apos;s buying a much bigger place . it &apos;s got a great view of central park ..
that &apos;s enough out of you .
is there anything we should know about the place ?
all the appliances are included . there &apos;s a lot of light , a new kitchen .
i think you guys would be very happy here .
no , we &apos;re not together . we &apos;re definitely not a couple .
okay . sorry .
that &apos;s all right .
wow , you seemed pretty insulted by that .
what , i &apos;m not good enough for you ?
we are not gonna have this conversation again .
look at this place . why am i so intimidated by this guy ?
pretentious art . this huge , macho couch .
when we know all he does is sit around ..
crying about losing monica to a real man .
you don &apos;t think he &apos;s here , do you ?
i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s a nice place , but i gotta say , i don &apos;t know if i see myself living here .
well , let me see .
yeah , i can see it .
look at these videos . i mean , who does he think he is ?
magnum force , dirty harry , cool hand luke .
oh , my god .
what ?
there &apos;s a tape here with monica &apos;s name on it .
a tape with a girl &apos;s name on it . it &apos;s probably a sex tape .
wait a minute .
this says &quot; monica . &quot;
and this is richard &apos;s apartment .
get there faster !
wow . you look ..
like my mom .
i &apos;m wearing pantyhose .
great ! come on in .
okay .
thank you .
oh , my god . you &apos;re rich .
no , my parents are rich .
well , so ? they gotta die someday . hello !
mom , dad , this is phoebe .
phoebe , these are my parents , theodore and bitsy .
theodore , bitsy ..
what a delight .
it &apos;s so nice to finally meet you .
and you .
your home is lovely .
thank you . i &apos;ll give you a tour later . it &apos;s actually three floors .
holy crap !
why don &apos;t you come meet our friends .
try and stop me .
what are you doing ?
trying to get your parents to like me .
i &apos;m sure they will , but you don &apos;t have to do this .
i want them to get to know phoebe , not &quot; phoebe . &quot;
it is fun , though , isn &apos;t it ?
you &apos;ve got it .
all right .
it &apos;s hard to stop .
well , come on .
phoebe , these are our friends tom and sue engel .
phoebe , come sit . tell us a little bit about yourself .
so where are you from ?
okay .
well , all right . originally , i &apos;m from upstate ..
but then my mom killed herself , and my stepdad went to prison .
so i moved to the city , where i lived in a burned @-@ out buick lesabre for a while .
which was okay . that was okay .
until i got hepatitis , you know ..
because this pimp spit in my mouth and ..
but i got over it .
and , anyway , now i &apos;m a freelance massage therapist ..
which isn &apos;t always steady money , but at least i don &apos;t pay taxes .
so where does everyone summer ?
i &apos;m not gonna watch it . i don &apos;t need to watch it .
i mean , what good could possibly come from watching it ?
well , we know i &apos;m gonna watch it .
hey , dude , what &apos;s up ?
don &apos;t judge me ! i &apos;m only human !
did you take that tape ?
i had to ! imagine you were married and you found a tape of your wife ..
in another guy &apos;s apartment . wouldn &apos;t you need to know what was on it ?
i don &apos;t know . who am i married to ?
some girl .
she hot ?
how did she get me to settle down ?
all right , i &apos;m gonna watch it .
i mean , it &apos;s probably not even what i think it is .
even if it is , it can &apos;t possibly be as bad as what i &apos;m picturing in my head .
can it ?
in my experience , if a girl says yes to being taped ..
she doesn &apos;t say no to much else , i &apos;ll tell you .
then you have to watch it for me .
what ?
just for a few seconds so i can know what it is . please ?
all right , fine . but if i enjoy this , you have only yourself to blame !
why am i hearing cheering ?
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s just a football game .
it &apos;s just football ?
you were all worried for nothing .
it &apos;s football ! it &apos;s just football !
this is great ! this is the first time i &apos;ve ever enjoyed football !
i think it may be customary to get a beer .
what the .. ?
what are you doing ?
you don &apos;t wanna see what i just saw !
what are you guys doing ?
oh , my god ! is that richard ?
oh , god , this is not going well .
no , you &apos;re doing fine . really .
why don &apos;t you go talk to my dad .
okay , okay , okay .
still sure about me being myself ?
absolutely .
though maybe just a little less &quot; pimp spit . &quot;
so , theodore , i can see where mike gets his good looks from .
well ..
you must work out all the time .
not all the time . i do the best i can .
yeah , i bet . look out !
oh , my god . are you okay ?
i recently had surgery .
i &apos;m so sorry .
no , i &apos;ll be fine .
i just should check the stitches .
i really am sorry .
how could you know ? why wouldn &apos;t you punch me in the stomach ?
did you just hit my dad ?
yes . i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;ve never met a boyfriend &apos;s parents before .
but , i mean , you have met humans before , right ?
why don &apos;t you go talk to my mom .
okay , yeah , your mom . she looks nice . i can talk to her .
you do that , and i &apos;m gonna go check my dad for signs of internal bleeding .
bitsy ? listen , i wanted to thank you again for having me here tonight .
well , not at all .
also , i just want you to know what a wonderful man your son is .
thank you . i think so too .
it &apos;s a testament to how he was raised .
especially to you , because he &apos;s very respectful of women .
is he really ?
he is so considerate of my feelings .
you know , i think you &apos;d also like to know that he is a very gentle lover .
excuse me ?
no , don &apos;t get me wrong . no , not in like a sissy way .
when he gets going ..
he can rattle a headboard like a sailor on leave .
that &apos;s .. my boy .
awesome .
okay , please laugh for mommy . please ?
please laugh for mommy .
not funny , huh ?
well , so is it ..
only offensive novelty rap ?
or maybe just , you know , rap in general . because mommy can rap .
i can &apos;t rap .
all right , sweetheart . this is only because i love you so much .
and i know that you &apos;re not gonna tell anybody .
emma , you &apos;re laughing ! you are !
you really do like big butts , don &apos;t you ?
you beautiful little weirdo .
you missed it ! she was laughing !
it was amazing .
it was amazing . it was the most beautiful , beautiful sound .
i know , isn &apos;t it ? what &apos;d you do to get her to laugh ?
you know , i just .. a couple of things i tried . different ..
just sang a little &quot; the itsy @-@ bitsy spider . &quot;
you sang &quot; baby got back , &quot; didn &apos;t you ?
nothing else worked ! that girl is all about the ass !
and then it goes back to the chorus .
resolve . and that &apos;s the end of the song .
i realize you hadn &apos;t asked to hear it ..
but no one had spoken in 17 minutes .
phoebe writes lots of songs . what was that one you sang the other night ?
&quot; pervert parade &quot; ?
&quot; ode to a pubic hair &quot; ?
stop .
oh , god . is that veal ?
mom , i thought i told you , phoebe &apos;s a vegetarian .
no , that &apos;s okay . that &apos;s okay . i mean , i am a vegetarian ..
except for veal . yeah . no . veal i love .
phoebe , you don &apos;t have to eat that .
any baby animals . kittens , fish babies .
but , you know , especially veal .
you know , and this nice vein of fat running through it .
yummy .
so ..
what do you think ?
so you stole that tape from richard &apos;s apartment ?
listen to the judgment from the porn star !
that tape was never meant to be seen by ..
joey , i would feel more comfortable if this conversation were in private .
monica , look , i don &apos;t think you and i have any secrets anymore .
not ready to joke about it yet ? see you later .
why in the world would you take this tape ? and why would you watch it ?
because that &apos;s who i am . okay ?
i &apos;m sure a man like richard could see a tape like that and not be bothered .
it &apos;d just be another saucy anecdote ..
for him to share at his men &apos;s club over brandy and mustaches .
is all of this about you not being able to grow a mustache ?
this is about you and richard . he &apos;s clearly not over you .
he keeps a tape so he can look at it whenever he wants .
isn &apos;t that sad ? can &apos;t you see how pathetic that is ?
don &apos;t be jealous . you should feel bad for him .
yeah , well , poor richard , he ..
i can grow a mustache .
this is not our problem . we have each other . that &apos;s all that matters .
but i just keep picturing you rolling around with him , with your ..
cowboy boots in the air .
cowboy boots ? i &apos;ve never worn cowboy boots in my whole life .
good , good . play more because i wanna see how it ends .
that &apos;s not me !
what ?
that &apos;s not you ! life is good again !
ride &apos; em , cowgirl !
that bastard taped over me !
is that a problem ?
it &apos;s just so insulting . spring for a new blank tape , doctor !
yes , but the important thing is that we have each other , right ?
well , yeah . it &apos;s just so rude !
and the way we did it was a lot better ..
are you going to finish that sentence ?
i can &apos;t imagine what he sees in her .
she actually makes me miss that pill @-@ popping ex @-@ wife of his .
hello , dear .
what &apos;s going on ?
we were just chitchatting .
how &apos;s your friend ?
a little better .
do you know who &apos;s moving back into town ? tom and sue &apos;s daughter , jen .
you remember her , michael . she &apos;s lovely , well @-@ behaved and single .
i &apos;m not interested .
please , darling , let &apos;s be honest .
you can have all the sailor fun you want with that one .
but let &apos;s be real .
all right , stop .
all phoebe has done is try and get you to like her . maybe it &apos;s not clear ..
but she did her best .
she &apos;s a little different than you are .
michael , a pimp spit in her mouth .
so what ? if i can get past that , it shouldn &apos;t bother you .
you don &apos;t have to like her . just accept the fact that i do .
if you can &apos;t even be civil to the woman i love ..
the woman you what ?
yeah , the woman you what ?
the woman i love .
i love you .
something i shouldn &apos;t say for the first time , in front of my parents ..
and tom and sue .
who are , by the way , the most sinfully boring people i &apos;ve ever met in my life .
i love you too .
you do ?
how great is this ?
wanna get out of here ?
mom , dad . thanks for dinner .
i had a great time .
it was really top @-@ drawer . and here &apos;s something rich .
thirteen bathrooms in this place , i threw up in the coat closet .
ta @-@ ta !
one more time from the top !
