第七季 第七集
this is me ,
i was traveling at 35 miles per hour down bosworth avenue ,
when i saw the light at le moyne changing ,
so i pulled to a stop .
and did you see something in your rearview mirror ?
i did .
a car coming up behind me .
and how fast was it traveling ?
about 35 miles per hour .
but it didn &apos;t stop or slow down .
it just rammed right into my car .
it shoved me into the cross traffic ,
and that &apos;s how i ended up here .
in a wheelchair .
for life .
yes .
who was driving the car that hit you , wendy ?
him .
let the record reflect
that wendy pointed to tim brewster .
excuse me , i wasn &apos;t driving that car .
tim .
what ?
why aren &apos;t you objecting ?
it &apos;s a depo , tim .
we &apos;ll get to your side of things .
who was behind the wheel , wendy ?
tim brewster .
and did he see you ?
yes . i saw him in the rearview mirror .
he clearly saw my car .
but he didn &apos;t slow down ? he didn &apos;t stop ?
hat &apos;s right .
would you like to say something , mr. ephraham ?
i &apos;m not being deposed .
it wasn &apos;t my fault ,
and you know it-- it was your car &apos;s fault .
why don &apos;t we take a moment , please ?
tim , i thought we agreed .
we &apos;re going in there with a united front .
yeah , somehow a united front means i get screwed .
it was in driverless mode .
i tried hitting the brake , i tried turning .
that &apos;s impossible , and you know it .
even in driverless mode , it can be overridden
at any time .
yeah , yeah .
and i &apos;m telling you i couldn &apos;t override it .
then that &apos;s your fault , isn &apos;t it ? you illegally ...
all right , let &apos;s not talk about fault .
great job .
keep blaming tim , it &apos;ll split &apos; em up .
then what ?
they &apos;re setting you up .
i &apos;m not talking to you .
what else can they do ?
your ceo friend can &apos;t admit that it was his autonomous car
that malfunctioned ...
buddy , save yourself the breath .
i &apos;m not joining your side .
don &apos;t .
but get yourself your own lawyer .
because they &apos;re not gonna defend you .
your business means nothing to them .
it &apos;s the ceo that &apos;s the deep pocket here .

call her .
everybody , take your seats please .
we &apos;re ready to start .
vote no on the first vote .
don &apos;t forget .
well , welcome back
to the chicago election board , everyone .
we have a full agenda , so i &apos;d like to get started .
but first i &apos;d like to welcome our newest member .
alicia florrick .
we want to thank her for giving her expertise
and her independence to the great work of this committee .
i believe , uh , we still have a vote outstanding .
yes , we do , mr. chair .
regarding the status of klt .
we were tied , three to three .
thank you , mr. hallman .
the tabled motion was to replace
the current licensee with swan systems .
all those in favor of mr. hallman &apos;s motion ,
please raise your hand .
all those opposed .
three opposed .
we &apos;re tied again .
mrs. florrick , you have the right to vote ...
she doesn &apos;t have to vote .
i &apos;m sorry .
i have no idea what the issue is .
mr. hallman believes
we should replace our current contractor
for election machines with a new one , swan systems .
even though you are new
to this committee , mrs. florrick , you can vote .
if she doesn &apos;t want to vote , she doesn &apos;t have to vote .
mrs. florrick , do you want to vote ?
good .
all those in favor of the motion .
all those opposed .
no , this is bullcrap .
you bought her !
mr. hallman !
no , sir ! i supported your membership ,
mrs. florrick ,
because i thought you would be honest here .
the vote didn &apos;t go your way , sir .
now get over it .
okay . let &apos;s move on to the financial ...
everything all right ?
yeah . you heading out ?
prior accidents of a self @-@ driving car .
ah . what ?
new case . four hours , capped .
can you do me a favor ?
that depends .
could you find out about a company
called klt and what connection it has
with the head of the democratic committee , frank landau ?
all right . what am i looking for ?
anything .
anything it is .
maybe you and i could talk sometime .
sure . what about ?
everything .
okay . tonight . 7 : 00 p.m.
done .
mrs. florrick , i am so glad you &apos;re doing this .
so am i.
we &apos;ll meet you there , tim .
good case . a three @-@ way .
with who ?
lockhart / agos and louis canning .
it should be fun .
what &apos;s wrong now , eli ?
have any reporters tried to call you ?
no . why ?
if anyone tries to call you , don &apos;t answer .
why ?
vice is reporting
that you and peter have not shared a bed for three years .
oh , dear god .
yeah .
we &apos;re gonna face some uncomfortable questions .
let us focus group some answers before you say anything .
you &apos;d better get in there .
alicia , i &apos;ll call you back .
is the governor staying with his wife while he &apos;s back in chicago ?
and if not , why not ?
is it because the florrick marriage is ... ?
what can i promise ?
what do you need ?
this week . peter &apos;s here for the vote .
folks , hold on , hold on .
you can rip me up later .
this vice article is nonsense .
nonsense ?
peter is back in illinois this week
to veto the physician @-@ assisted suicide bill .
and of course he &apos;ll be staying with his wife .
ruth ...
you &apos;re getting to alicia ?
right now .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;re all aware , peter &apos;s been spending
a lot of time in iowa ...
alicia , can you call me as soon as you can ?
the campaign needs to ask you a favor .
ma &apos;am , this just came in .
thanks .
you miss it ?
the pressure to bill hours , kowtow to clients ,
and wrangle all the personalities ?
the money ?
the money never really materialized .
it always seemed to be somewhere over the horizon .
yeah . i can see you here . making clients wait .
ordering associates around .
being the queen bee bitch .
i &apos;m a much calmer person now .
oh , my god , that &apos;s a terrifying thought .
shall we ?
sorry for our lateness .
lucca quinn and ...
... alicia florrick .
we &apos;ve filed a substitution of attorney with the court .
we &apos;re representing mr. brewster now .
and we &apos;ll decamp here if that &apos;s all right .
that would be great . please do .
well , shall we start ?
便捷科技能够以普通司机10倍的速度识别并规避危险
these are the laser ranging and detection units .
the car uses them to create a 3 @-@ d map of the street ahead .
to see and avoid any potential hazards .
on the front and rear bumper , there are three radar units .
they detect the speed of oncoming cars
and slow down if there are any obstacles .
and these are all redundant technologies ?
yes .
the t @-@ portable has four layers of cross @-@ referenced sensors .
it is by far the safest car on the road today .
no one has ever died or been injured
in any car accident caused by my t @-@ port .
that would be news to my client .
that accident was not caused by my car .
it was caused by one of my employees ,
who took the car for an unauthorized test drive .
which is why your client should not be suing me .
she should be suing that gentleman over there .
but i guess i have too deep a pocket .
thank you , mr. ephraham . your witness .
is it legal to drive this car-- strike that .
is it legal for this car to drive itself
in the state of illinois ?
no . but it is in michigan .
that &apos;s nice . why is it illegal in illinois ?
well , some states want more data .
unfortunately , data like this nuisance suit
won &apos;t help .
well , it &apos;s unfortunate
that my client got in the way of your car &apos;s progress .
i didn &apos;t say that .
ms. searle &apos;s injury is unfortunate ,
but it has nothing whatever to do with my car .
technology can overcome most obstacles ,
but it can &apos;t overcome human nature .
i have no further questions at this moment .
so why don &apos;t we take a break .
actually ,
we have a few questions .
of course .
good afternoon , mr . ephraham .
good afternoon .
in 2014 you told wired magazine
that the t @-@ port had &quot; the most advanced ai software
on the market . every day it &apos;s learning something new . &quot;
what does that mean ?
each time the car is driven ,
it learns something new about a @-@ a street ,
the , um , behavioral dynamics of other drivers , pedestrians ,
the objects all around it .
so it gets smarter ?
yes .
which means it isn &apos;t smart to begin with .
well , it &apos;s pretty darn smart .
yes .
but you yourself admit the software will learn .
so there must be something to be learned .
there &apos;s always something to be learned .
because every situation on the road is unique ?
yes .
actually , mr. ephraham ,
don &apos;t you mean that there might be
slight variations in a road encounter ,
and that &apos;s all ?
yes , that &apos;s right .
thanks , cary , for that correction .
and why is it important for the software to learn ?
so it knows how to deal with all possible street encounters .
which means it doesn &apos;t know how to deal with
all encounters now ?
no .
i @-@ i &apos;m not trying to trick you , mr. ephraham .
if the software learns ,
then it must not know what it needs to learn , right ?
let &apos;s return to that .
wendy , was it raining on the day of your accident ?
it was . fairly hard .
mr. ephraham , is rain one of those road conditions
that the t @-@ port needs to learn how to negotiate ?
it knows how to negotiate rain .
and yet weren &apos;t there two accidents on your test track during a rainstorm ?
there were a lot of accidents on the test track .
that &apos;s why we call it a test track .
the software was still learning ?
right .
as it is now ?
why don &apos;t we take a break there .
i &apos;m being ganged up on .
i &apos;ve got lawyers crawling all over me
because you two lost me tim .
we didn &apos;t lose him , sir .
he exercised his right to find another lawyer . ?
watch out , or i might , too .
what do you think ?
i think we &apos;re treating alicia like an enemy
when we should be treating her like a free agent .
very well played in there .
thank you .
they &apos;ll probably be coming after wendy next ,
so we should talk .
we just did .
lucca quinn .
tell me if it &apos;s too strong .
so , this must be serious .
i mean , we &apos;re in your kitchen .
yeah , well ...
no , no , it &apos;s just , i , um ,
i was wanting to see how you ...
liked it here .
here , at your work ?
yeah .
i like it .
how am i doing ?
great .
well , good , we &apos;re both great .
i feel like you want to say something .
no , i ...
it &apos;s just ...
the insurance here ,
um , i have to , you know , get my ducks in a row .
hold on .
here .
thanks .
i , um , wanted to see if you could sign this
for me .
it &apos;s just a standard
release for liability reasons .
mm , in case i beat someone up ?
no , just in case anything .
you know , you ... trip on my stairs .
or ... cut yourself .
on an ice tray .
i hate doing it .
but , um , the insurance is expensive
and it cuts down on cost .
and if i don &apos;t sign it ?
if you don &apos;t ...
well , why wouldn &apos;t you sign it ?
i don &apos;t like signing things .
well , the @-@ the problem is that we &apos;re not a big firm ,
so this is , this is just ...
thank you .
yeah .
i &apos;m sorry .
did that seem untrusting ?
no .
i get it .
you &apos;re running a business .
thanks again .
would you like ... ?
what ?
would i like ... ?
would you like to have dinner ?
i @-@ i have pizza .
pizza sounds good .
good .
i don &apos;t have pizza .
i have mini tacos .
mini tacos sound good .
all right , let me just check the expiration .
good , we &apos;re good !
one minute-- that &apos;s just the laundry .
hey , thanks for doing this .
hey , thanks for doing this .
doing what ?
letting me stay here .
eli didn &apos;t call ?
no . or he may have ...
i &apos;m jason .
hey , i &apos;m peter .
uh , jason is my new investigator .
i don &apos;t recall you mentioning anything about an investigator .
she tries to do most of the work herself .
uh @-@ huh , yeah , that sounds like my wife .
it &apos;s an honor to meet you , sir .
you &apos;ve been a great governor .
thank you , thank @-@ thank you very much .
you know what ? i @-@ i should go .
no , no , don &apos;t leave on my account .
got to get back to work .
excuse me , governor ?
as do i. donor calls .
half my job is fund @-@ raising .
i can imagine .
we &apos;ll talk , right ?
always .
good to meet you , jason .
eli gold .
oh , finally you decided to return my ...
alicia , wait .
alicia , i called you ten times .
ali @-@ alicia , can i call you back ?
um , wait , wait !
it @-@ it &apos;s only until friday .
yeah , okay , bye , bye @-@ bye .
nora , nora . come here , quick !
come on !
what ?
who was that that went into ruth &apos;s office ?
i have no idea .
was that courtney paige ?
who &apos;s courtney paige ?
hrt industries .
only one of the most powerful ceos in america .
never heard of her .
well , go in there and see if it &apos;s really her .
and ... how am i supposed to do that ?
offer them water or something .
see if there &apos;s a scar on her hand .
you &apos;re joking .
no . she got into a paragliding accident .
i don &apos;t get paid enough .
go . go . my god .
i &apos;m tired of being burned .
i &apos;ve come to suspect passion .
i supported john edwards .
yes , i know .
but i can assure you the florrick marriage is solid .
i brought you some water
in case you were thirsty .
thank you , nora .
uh , peter and alicia &apos;s marriage
has survived the test of both time and tumult .
and they have come out the stronger .
well , i &apos;m no prude .
i &apos;m just tired of seeing democratic candidates
sidelined by personal failings .
nora , do you mind ?
seriously , eli ?
did you see a scar ?
i couldn &apos;t see .
well , get back in there and see if it &apos;s her .
i have an mba from syracuse .
i graduated summa cum laude
and i spent a year at the sorbonne studying french poetry .
i &apos;m done playing i love lucy for you .
but ...
eli ?
uh , just a minute .
do you have a minute ?
yeah .
courtney paige . hello .
eli gold . i &apos;ve followed
your career closely , ms. paige .
oh , that &apos;s a terrifying thought .
courtney &apos;s looking for a candidate to support .
someone new and fresh .
i like underdogs .
who doesn &apos;t ?
but she &apos;s worried about the florrick marriage .
i said you could comfort her fears .
yes . here i am ...
to comfort .
i &apos;d like to meet with them together at some point .
well , uh , how about later this week ?
yes , yes . uh ... uh , for the birthday party .
whose birthday ?
is it grace &apos;s birthday ?
i have no idea .
well , then why did you say it ?
i don &apos;t know .
it just popped out . i &apos;ll talk to alicia .
what &apos;s so important , eli ?
march . why ?
i have no words .
no . you can keep talking ,
but i have no words for this .
you &apos;ve had your fair share of accidents over the years ,
haven &apos;t you , ms. searle ?
well , what do you mean ?
it means they &apos;re blaming the victim .
you were found at fault in an accident in 2010
and then in 2012 .
yes , but that was different than this .
also , your driver &apos;s license indicates that you wear corrective lenses .
but you weren &apos;t wearing corrective lenses
on the night of the accident ?
no , but ... ?
thank you .
do you want to take this or should i ?
let me .
wendy , um , you said , &quot; no , but ... &quot;
to ms. lockhart &apos;s last question . um ,
what was your full answer going to be ?
no , but i don &apos;t need the contact lenses for driving .
good , thank you . and on the night of the accident ,
were you texting while driving ?
was i ...
excuse me ?
were you texting on the night of the accident
while driving ?
i ... not while driving .
well , i have a text sent from you ...
12 p.m. that &apos;s less than 20 seconds before the accident .
nice job blaming the victim .
watch it .
you used to be a nicer person , you know .
good thing your place is so quiet .
not a lot of luck in finding t @-@ port accidents .
the car is pretty damn safe .
that &apos;s too bad .
and yet ?
two things .
a month before the accident they added
a fuzzy driving feature to the software .
a what ?
fuzzy driving--
they found that the car obeyed traffic laws a little too well .
it would stop at a four @-@ way stop and let
all the other cars keep going through ,
because it was supposed to wait for them to come to a complete stop .
so , essentially , it never moved .
the car was too safe ?
right .
so ephraham added the fuzzy driving feature .
made the car more aggressive ,
more human .
it would roll through stop signs .
it would be more aggressive when changing lanes .
so they made it ... less safe ?
could argue that .
that &apos;s a pretty good argument .
what &apos;s the second thing ?
the hard drive was erased ...
after the accident .
what ?
i tried to download a record of the accident from the t @-@ port .
there was nothing there .
somebody erased the hard drive .
really ?
mr. hallman .
hello . may i help you ?
is your house always like this ?
no , this is unusual .
um ... would you like to sit down ?
i want you to stop being a stooge .
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m not sure ...
you &apos;re landau &apos;s stooge on the board .
you &apos;re voting with him , and he &apos;s a corrupt son of a bitch .
mr. hallman , whatever your issues are with mr. landau ...
my issue isn &apos;t with mr. landau . he &apos;s beyond saving .
but you &apos;re not .
i &apos;m bringing this up for another vote this week .
then i &apos;m gonna ask landau to stand down
and nominate you to take the chair .
you ... what ?
there are enough votes to put a woman in charge .
everybody &apos;s been feeling the pressure from their home districts ...
mr. hallman , i just ...
but i need you to vote against klt .
then i can make you chair .
but i don &apos;t want to be chair .
mrs. florrick ...
corruption doesn &apos;t start out there .
it doesn &apos;t start in d.c. or springfield .
it starts here , in you and me ,
and only if we let it happen , so don &apos;t .
it &apos;s as easy as that .
just don &apos;t .
... safe gap left by the t @-@ port .
this accident was not caused by fuzzy driving .
but fuzzy driving makes the car drive more like a human , right ?
yes . like a safe human
that still follows the traffic laws .
but not in the case of keeping a safe two @-@ car distance on the freeway .
wait a minute . stop ganging up here .
the only reason we added that feature is because human drivers
kept dangerously merging into the safe gap
left by the t @-@ port .
that &apos;s why the t @-@ port has been more aggressive .
in other words , that &apos;s why it tailgates ?
objection . he didn &apos;t say that .
no . not tailgates .
look , its human drivers are the ones making roads more dangerous .
th @-@ the t @-@ port is just adapting .
by being more aggressive , by being more human ,
which resulted in this accident .
no . this accident was caused by humans .
then why did you erase the car &apos;s hard drive ?
i did not erase the hard drive .
then how did it get erased ?
why don &apos;t we take a break ?
no , i &apos;d like to answer that .
the hard drive was damaged by the force of the accident .
we &apos;re not talking about an airplane &apos;s black box here .
it is vulnerable to impact .
that &apos;s not true .
you &apos;ve had several other accidents--
never has there been any data loss .
yes , but that was a real @-@ world ...
excuse me .
mr. brewster &apos;s being deposed now .
so , if the accident didn &apos;t erase the hard drive , how &apos;d it happen ?
obviously somebody deliberately erased the data after the fact .
no .
excuse me . who are you ?
anthony edward dudewitz .
and what this ... engineer is suggesting is complete balderdash .
if you don &apos;t mind , mr. dudewitz ...
i do mind . i do mind mediocrity .
it has a taint , like burned toast ,
and you stink of it .
all right , let me just tell you , mr. dudewitz
is the original developer of the t @-@ portable .
he is here as my next witness . i didn &apos;t know he &apos;d be here .
anthony .
what ? thief , bungler .
i &apos;ll testify if he &apos;s gone .
so you work with mr. ephraham ?
work ?
yes , i work with the great charles ephraham .
he handles the money ; i handle the genius .
and what was your specific involvement with the t @-@ portable ?
i designed the interface .
i hired most of these monkeys . like that idiot .
let the record reflect i am nodding to
the code monkey sitting over there .
am i boring you ?
oh , far from it . i can &apos;t wait to return .
so , regarding the hard drive ,
you said it couldn &apos;t have been manually erased ?
not without leaving some electronic trace .
there is no connection between the designer of the voting machines ,
klt , and frank landau .
but ... ?
how do you know there &apos;s a &quot; but &quot; ?
there &apos;s always a &quot; but &quot; with you .
but ...
there is a connection between klt
and a shell company called pigster union ,
owned by none other than frank landau &apos;s wife .
really ?
and why is this important ?
no reason . just ... something .
um , hey , i &apos;m really sorry about last night with peter .
why ? cool guy .
&quot; cool &quot; ?
yeah .
you still owe me mini tacos , by the way .
i &apos;ll get right on that .
hey , one other thing .
this guy ...
dudewitz ? yeah ?
yeah ,
i &apos;ve seen him on ted talk .
you might want to ask him something .
ted talk ? really ?
yeah . what &apos;s wrong ?
no , no , you just ...
you don &apos;t seem like the ted talk kind of guy .
ah . i &apos;m an insomniac .
you &apos;d be surprised what i get into late at night .
does that answer your question ?
can i make it even simpler for you ?
tell me if these words get too complicated .
no . i &apos;m good .
so the hard disk could not have been erased ?
yep . can i go now ?
um , actually , just a few questions from me , mr. dudewitz .
ah , you . you &apos;re back . we &apos;ve been having fun in here .
i &apos;m glad .
i guess you devised the fuzzy driving software for the t @-@ port ?
yes . you are correct in your guess .
and i imagine
this is the very definition of a.i. , artificial intelligence ?
how sweet .
you helpfully explained what a.i. means .
you are again correct in your imagination .
mr. dudewitz , what do you think of the future of a.i. ?
objection . speculation .
it &apos;s a proper objection , even in a deposition .
i &apos;ll rephrase . what do you think of a.i. ?
what do you want to know ? just ask .
are we in danger from a.i. ?
i think it &apos;s getting smarter .
every day . learning our boundaries and its boundaries--
it &apos;s evolving .
i think there will be an adjustment period after it takes over ,
but eventually ...
wait , i &apos;m sorry to interrupt .
um , what do you mean by &quot; takes over &quot; ?
the singularity .
when the system is capable of recursive self @-@ improvement ,
when it is better at recalibrating ,
expanding and spawning than we are ,
the brief blip of humanity &apos;s reign
will reach its inevitable conclusion .
so you &apos;re saying the robots are coming to get us ?
no . i hear the ridicule in your voice , ma &apos;am .
i &apos;m just saying they won &apos;t have much use for us .
mr. dudewitz , who else believes that a.i. has the potential to be dangerous ?
elon musk , stephen hawking , bill gates ...
so this is not an unorthodox position ?
certainly it &apos;s unorthodox-- it &apos;s held by geniuses ,
like myself .
the sheep are too busy watching tv .
thank you , cary . one last question .
how do you think the car &apos;s hard drive got erased ?
objection .
speculation .
i @-@ i &apos;ll rephrase .
do you think that the car &apos;s ...
capable of erasing its own memory ?
yes , i do .
and if you believe that ,
don &apos;t you think that the software
could override the safety features ?
i don &apos;t think i would go that far .
but if you believe that a.i.
can transcend its creators &apos; original mission ,
and you introduced the theory of fuzzy driving
in order to make the car more aggressive , more human @-@ like ,
then why couldn &apos;t the computer override your safety controls ?
come on , that has so many layers of hypotheticals and suppositions ...
hey , he &apos;s your witness , not mine .
well ,
i &apos;m noting my objection for the record .
mr. dudewitz , do you have an answer for that ?
i am a smart man .
a genius .
yes , and i &apos;ve created something so complex , i can &apos;t positively tell
what it can do and what it can &apos;t .
so it could have put that woman into a wheelchair ?
it &apos;s possible .
thank you , sir .
this has been most illuminating .
hey , guys .
well , we couldn &apos;t have gone this far without your support .
well , thank you , mr. oliver . thank you .
i deeply , deeply appreciate it .
okay .
you , too .
another fund @-@ raising call ?
yeah . well , it &apos;s a necessary evil .
but then , uh , you &apos;d know about that .
tequila ?
you &apos;ve graduated .
i am in a celebratory mood .
oh ? good day in court ?
there &apos;s nothing better than a good cross .
you ?
well , that was $ 1 million .
things are clicking .
i like when things click .
you &apos;re okay in the bonus room ?
yeah .
feels like old times .
want to get laid ?
do you ?
sure . i &apos;ve got 20 minutes .
me , too .
next stop , lincoln bedroom .
think it &apos;s any different there ?
oh , yeah-- everybody gets laid there .
you think you have a shot ?
i think ruth thinks i have a shot ...
if things go wrong with hillary .
or bernie .
zach &apos;s ?
yeah .
this all right ?
are you planning on making noise ?
just in case .
no .
that &apos;s another million dollars .
which do you want more ?
where &apos;s peter ?
sleeping .
peter ?
peter , i have a call .
be right out .
so you &apos;re all right with this ?
peter , i basically seduced you .
you don &apos;t have to call me in the morning .
yeah , it was sexy , huh ?
it &apos;s always sexier not to care .
why is that ?
because sex is sexier without love .
yeah ?
i have mrs. blumen on the line .
she ... wants to give money ,
but she wants to talk to you .
give it to me .
mrs. blumen , hello .
how you doing , eli ?
i &apos;m ... not sure .
oh . you catching a cold ?
no . no .
you &apos;re being smart , aren &apos;t you ?
always .
so , if you were driving
at 35 miles per hour , mr. brewster ,
you had seven seconds to switch out of driverless mode
and hit the brakes ?
but that wasn &apos;t my responsibility .
but isn &apos;t that part of why you were in the car ?
to step in if it malfunctioned ?
objection .
miss characterizes earlier testimony .
your objection is preserved for judge .
all i did was turn on the defroster .
and then , a few seconds later , the lights started flashing ,
the radio starts flipping stations .
it was like the car had a mind of its own .
so , were you asleep at the switch ?
excuse me . one interrogator at a time , please .
but were you asleep at the switch ?
i was not asleep .
i never actually fell asleep .
actually asleep ? okay , good .
were you dozing ?
the car is supposed to drive itself .
so you were dozing ?
maybe when you were asleep ,
you accidentally disengaged the driverless mode , and ...
objection . he already said he wasn &apos;t sleeping .
this isn &apos;t deposition by ambush .
he &apos;s either going to answer our questions
one at a time or altogether . it &apos;s his choice .
so you were asleep at the switch ?
right now , i &apos;m in full control ,
but we can go driverless at any time .
thanks for doing this , mr. dudewitz .
i don &apos;t like thank yous .
they &apos;re a remnant of a hypocritical society .
ready to go driverless ?
let &apos;s do it .
i can now read , shave , yodel .
the car is driving itself ?
yup . i just put into
the gps the intersection where the crash happened .
oh . okay , that kid ?
that kid could be the next steve jobs .
the car just saved his life .
you &apos;re welcome , kid .
okay .
we &apos;re in the proximity of where the accident happened .
what did you do then ?
nothing . i just sat .
what was that ?
a pothole .
so , you said you hit the defroster . when was that ?
uh , just before this next intersection .
now .
the defroster . and ...
nothing .
all right , what &apos;d you do after you turned on the defroster ?
i turned it off .
and a few seconds later , the lights started flashing ,
the radio turned on ,
and all the windows rolled down .
you &apos;re wrong .
i &apos;m just telling you what happened .
maybe your memory is faulty .
there &apos;s no way the a.i. has control over the windows .
look , it was cold outside .
the windows rolled down .
maybe you bumped into the controls .
i did not .
mr. dudewitz .
if tim ... didn &apos;t misremember if the windows did roll down ,
how could that happen ?
it couldn &apos;t have . whenever i see an equation
and it doesn &apos;t add up , i know where the problem lies .
it &apos;s with humans .
it &apos;s always with humans .
and is the only human in this equation tim ?
if he was the only one in the car , if he was ...
yeah ?
there could be another human involved .
not one in the car .
who ?
a hacker .
r.l. burnside ?
it &apos;s all his hits .
i have read biographies galore ,
books on philosophy , but i ... i find
that all of life &apos;s biggest questions can be answered
by that cd .
this is great .
thank you so much .
so when is your actual birthday ?
the 14th .
remember that blues club
we went to in , uh , georgetown ? monique &apos;s ?
oh , yeah . it &apos;s probably gone now .
yeah . believe it or not ,
this sophisticated lady you see sitting there
got on top of the bar and started dancing with her friends .
mom ? you did ?
i was 22 , and , of course , i tripped .
and fell into my arms , throwing up on my back .
oh , god , you were such a baby .
so , ms. paige , did you really
tell the king of saudi arabia
to start letting more women into the workplace ?
i did indeed , although i did it politely .
how did he respond ?
oh , exactly how i thought he would .
he , uh , smiled and asked me to pass the lamb .
she was supposed to leave 30 minutes ago .
i &apos;m not sure if that &apos;s a good thing or a bad one .
it &apos;s good-- they like each other .
everything &apos;s going great .
oh , mr. gold .
oh , dear god , what are you doing here , jackie ?
ms. eastman , how are you ?
hello .
this is howard .
eli , ruth .
how do you do ?
hi .
uh , peter and alicia are having a dinner party
for ruth-- f @-@ for grace .
yes , i know , that &apos;s why we &apos;re here .
we have something to tell them .
it &apos;s actually not a good time right now , jackie .
it &apos;s always a good time to see my son , mr. gold .
what can happen ?
so what was it like growing up in texas ?
hello !
mother ? what a surprise .
you call that standing guard ?
a man has got to know his limitations ,
and your mother is mine .
oh , what is this ? a party ?
yes , it &apos;s my birthday party .
but your birthday isn &apos;t until ...
we &apos;re celebrating a little early this year , jackie .
yes , we &apos;re ... gonna celebrate now .
oh , well , well ,
how nice ... and how ... early .
ms. paige , this is my mother jackie florrick and her , uh ...
her , uh ... howard lyman .
a pleasure , ma &apos;am .
oh , the pleasure &apos;s all mine .
i @-@ i like peter &apos;s african @-@ american friends .
jackie , do you have a minute out here ?
there &apos;s something i want to talk to you about .
well , yes , but first , uh , i have some news .
we have some news .
let &apos;s share that news later .
howard and i ... are engaged .
are you insane , mom ? !
we &apos;re in love .
grandma , i &apos;m so happy for you !
mother ? mother , you ... ?
this is not a good idea .
it is , peter , and i &apos;m so happy .
who would have thought we &apos;d find love at this age ?
guess this makes me
stepfather @-@ general .
that &apos;s wonderful . congratulations .
yes , wonderful indeed .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll want to resume your celebration out in the hall .
but doesn &apos;t anyone want to hear how he proposed ?
no .
oh , yes !
please .
well , first of all , howard took me
to this lovely dinner at tournesol .
so , you were in selma during the march ?
yeah , i was there for a deposition .
uh , even got to meet the man himself , dr. king .
really ?
mm .
told him to speed things up .
couldn &apos;t get to my car .
so @-@ so what brings you here ?
you want a drink ?
yeah .
or a gun .
oh , just give up , eli .
bad things happen or they don &apos;t .
but there &apos;s just too much craziness in the world .
like you and peter ?
the old me would be provoked by that statement .
but the new me ... just doesn &apos;t care .
so , yes ... like me and peter .
well , we &apos;d better get going .
we &apos;re meeting friends downtown .
oh , peter , dear , will you get my things ?
no . allow me .
he &apos;s so chivalrous .
it was so nice spending time with you , ms. paige .
you are an inspiration to all urban children .
thank you .
uh , don &apos;t beat yourself up .
i don &apos;t know the first thing about wines .
ms. paige , hello .
uh , courtney .
and i still am a houston girl .
my drink of choice-- any soda with the word &quot; cherry &quot; in it .
this was a disaster tonight , wasn &apos;t it ?
no . i like , um ... reality .
well , you got a lot of that tonight .
don &apos;t worry so much .
you &apos;re the second person to tell me that tonight .
well , then it must be true .
i got it .
what are you doing ?
what am i ... ?
are .... are you asking what am i doing here ?
with craig hallman ?
what are you doing with craig hallman ?
mr. landau , i &apos;m a bit tired .
i know he &apos;s pushing for a new vote .
i know he was here .
yes , and i know that your wife is
a part owner of klt .
he tell you that ?
no .
are you gonna vote against me ?
mr. landau , i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m gonna do .
i can hurt you .
i can hurt peter .
gentlemen ,
i think this man has something to say to you .
i don &apos;t mean physically .
you can recover from being physically hurt .
oh , look , just stop it , frank .
let me vote the way i want to .
think about this .
your new little friend , hallman , is part owner of swan systems .
nobody &apos;s innocent here .
so you either vote for me or him .
good luck with that .
so , could the t @-@ port be hacked ?
t @-@ portable , and yes .
i thought you said that was impossible .
is that an objection ?
what i said was , it was impossible
for the car to be hacked
without the hacker leaving a trace .
the only time the car is vulnerable
is when it goes into computer update .
someone could plant a virus while it was happening ,
and no one would notice .
so , you &apos;re saying the hack came from inside the company ?
yes .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m saying . i did a search .
mr. brewster , the idiot coder over there ,
had idiot coder friends , all idiot coders , too ,
and they all eat at acapulco ,
and they all smell like elephants at the circus .
mr. dudewitz .
they hacked the t @-@ portable
hard drive before he took the car out .
they wanted to play with him ?
that &apos;s right . humans
always there to disappoint .
they wanted to spook him , but they crashed his car
into your car , ma &apos;am , i &apos;m sorry to say .
and then they covered their tracks ?
yes , they wiped the hard drive .
i hope you have enough insurance
to cover this , charles .
you &apos;re pretty happy about this ?
it &apos;s just money .
one less horse for your homestead .
thank you , mr. dudewitz .
can i leave now ?
i was just coming to see you .
i &apos;m so glad .
shall we ?
it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s being cleaned .
just wanted to thank you for inviting me to the florricks &apos; .
no problem . i &apos;m sorry it was so , uh ... eventful .
i like events .
no reason to apologize to me for that .
so what do you think ?
of peter and alicia ?
i thought they were boring .
oh . like a real married couple .
i &apos;m gonna back peter .
good .
wait a minute , wait a minute .
you have constantly ...
that &apos;s
the only reason why we &apos;re in complete disagreement .
... been acting as a gadfly with only one interest . imagine if the rest ...
that &apos;s stopping this board from moving forward .
imagine if the rest of the board was ... - you &apos;re obsessed ...
any other discussion ?
mrs. florrick ,
do you have any discussion about this very important issue ?
would you like me to have some ?
i would like you to speak for yourself .
i think that the two of you ... have issues .
that may be true , but you still have to vote on it .
the election board either has to renew its license
with klt and its voting machines ,
or reject it and license with swan .
all those for swan ,
raise your hands .
all those against ?
mrs. florrick ?
