第三季 第七集
honey , what is all this ?
hey , mam , i &apos;m trying to write these stupid college essay questions .
and i really even don &apos;t know how to start .
ok , what &apos;s the question ? tell me .
&quot; what &apos;s the biggest obstacle you &apos;ve ever had to overcome ? &quot;
didn &apos;t my third grade teacher say
i had , like , a.d.d. or something ?
oh , no , honey . she said you couldn &apos;t add .
and she put it that way because she also knew you couldn &apos;t s @-@ p @-@ e @-@ l @-@ l .
wait , slow down ... oh ...
sweet heart .
what &apos;s this ?
we talked about this last week .
i said i &apos;m building luke a tree house . you said &quot; fine . &quot;
you know , sometimes i think you just tune me out .
i never told her . she just would have said &quot; no . &quot;
i don &apos;t remember agreeing to this , phil .
this is like the time you backed down the driveway
with a hang glider sticking out of the car .
if you &apos;d let me keep that ,
those geese would have followed me to the wetlands .
you would have died .
a hero .
so we spread out a nice blanket ,
opened up a bottle of vino ,
and watched the sun set over the water .
it was majestic .
majestic .
why ? why we never have the picnic ?
who wants to sit on a blanket ? there &apos;s no back support .
it &apos;s majestic .
last week , shorty took me to see the cirque du soleil--
it &apos;s like a circus , but classy .
so if you like elephants ,
don &apos;t hold your breath .
she &apos;s so cute .
jay hates the crowds , the beach , the rainbows .
rainbows ? it &apos;s just colors in the sky .
do we have to pull over every time and take a picture ?
shame . there &apos;s an expression in italian , jay--
dammi la tua mano e corriamo uniti per tutta la vita .
&quot; give me your hand and we will run together our whole lives . &quot;
jay also hates running .
here you go .
oh , thank you .
and here you go .
oh . what is this ?
you said to knock your socks off .
oh , well , look . it &apos;s already working !
well , two more of those ,
and you won &apos;t be wearing any underwear either .
oh ! look ...
cam , down . down .
maybe later .
oh , okay , maybe ... maybe later .
did you hear that ? waitress is flirting with me .
no , no . she &apos;s not flirting with you .
she &apos;s--she &apos;s trolling for tips , okay ?
she totally knows you &apos;re gay .
how would she know i &apos;m gay ?
uh , maybe it &apos;s the way you ordered a drink @-@ a @-@ doodle @-@ doo .
cam has this crazy theory that if he were straight ...
and julia roberts were single ...
they &apos;d be dating .
it &apos;s not crazy .
i met her once at an a.i.d.s. walk ,
and our chemistry was palpable .
no , you handed her a bottle of water .
and her fingers lingered .
because you wouldn &apos;t let go .
i could totally pick up any woman in here .
if by that , you mean lift her off the ground ,
then yes , i &apos;ll give you that .
i for sure could be a womanizer .
or you could be someone
who just stepped out of a machine called the womanizer .
okay , you know what ? that &apos;s it .
pick anyone in here .
if i can get their number , you do the laundry for a month .
if i fail , i &apos;ll do it .
okay . i hate doing laundry . so , um ...
no , um ...
oh , okay . right here .
her .
okay , great .
great . just get rid of my flair ...
whoa . where did cam go ?
i don &apos;t know . where is he ?
dinner was absolutely wonderful .
amazing .
hey , you know what ?
why don &apos;t you guys come salsa dancing with us tomorrow night ?
oh , yeah ! that would be great !
it sounds like so much fun . i love salsa dancing .
jay , let &apos;s go salsa dancing with them . look .
why not ?
i just bought that pay @-@ per @-@ view fight .
i tell you what-- we &apos;ll compromise .
we &apos;ll watch the fight . we &apos;ll eat salsa .
who needs him ? come dancing with us .
ay , no , i wouldn &apos;t want to--
no , no ! you &apos;d be doing me a favor .
shorty never wants to stop , and i could use a break .
you hear that jay ? i never stop .
all i hear is she could use a break .
hey ! oh , my god ! how are you ?
wow . look at you . you look fantastic .
thank you . so do you .
how long has it been ?
it feels like forever .
yeah .
um , when is the last time we saw each other ?
oh , let &apos;s see . i think it was at dave &apos;s thing .
you know what ? i &apos;m sorry .
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve heard .
i was in a terrible car accident ,
and ever since the coma ,
i have a really hard time placing names and faces .
so who are you again ?
oh , my god . i am so sorry .
it was just a clever way to try to approach you .
we don &apos;t know each other .
i &apos;ve never been in a coma .
but you so deserved that . that was the worst pick @-@ up ever .
oh , my god !
that was genius ! and mean !
now i know why we &apos;re old fake friends .
oh . can i buy you a drink ?
yeah . i &apos;m katie .
cameron .
if she were a hot guy ,
i would never have been that smooth .
it &apos;s ironic .
like the gift of the vagi .
there you go .
thank you . nice to meet you .
you , too . bye !
bye !
wham , bam , thank you , cam .
seriously ? you got her number ?
sure did. and all my shirts get ironed ,
and their seams should appear straight ,
just like their owner .
should you be using screws instead of nails ?
america was built with nails , son .
so was that gazebo you built for our 4th of july party .
i &apos;m telling you , you are gonna love this bad boy .
you know what can &apos;t climb trees ?
raccoons ?
worries .
raccoons can and will get up here ,
so don &apos;t leave any food ,
or they &apos;ll get territorial and attack .
are you sure this is a good idea ?
are you kidding me ?
you &apos;re gonna have so much fun hanging out up here with your buddies .
trust me , when you get older , it all changes .
why ?
well , life gets in the way .
did i just say &quot; wife gets in the way &quot; ?
&apos;cause sometimes i do that .
nope , you &apos;re good .
and you have lots of friends .
yeah , i have work friends ,
and your mom and i have couples friends ,
and there are my college friends ,
but they &apos;re scattered all over the country .
it &apos;s not the same as just shouting out
to your neighborhood buddies ,
&quot; hey , fellas ! i &apos;m up here in the tree house ! &quot; uhh !
fix that ... board .
i can &apos;t do this .
why are you so frustrated ?
because i &apos;ve never had any obstacles to overcome .
oh , honey , that &apos;s not true .
really ? name one .
you &apos;re lactose @-@ intolerant .
oh , &quot; dear college , cheese makes me gassy .
see you in september . &quot;
sweetie , you &apos;re not really starting your essays
&quot; dear college , &quot; are you ?
what difference does it make ?
i &apos;ve lived a boring , sheltered , pathetic life .
i am sorry we have made things too easy and comfortable for you .
oh , you should be ! it is all your fault !
you have shielded me
from everything interesting and dangerous !
you are blaming me
because i kept you from getting hurt ?
gaby &apos;s mom &apos;s a hoarder .
that essay practically writes itself .
maybe it is our fault .
but did you ever consider there &apos;s a reason ?
what are you talking about ?
there &apos;s a reason why we were so easy on you .
i don &apos;t understand .
oh , honey , you &apos;re old enough now .
old enough for what ?
the truth .
okay , come on . gotta show you somethin &apos; .
we &apos;re gonna go for a ride .
mom , just tell me .
you are my mom , right ?
i &apos;m a bad man .
oh , no . what did you eat ?
mitchell , remember the girl i met last night ?
how can i forget her ?
she &apos;s super famous for having the world &apos;s worst gay @-@ dar .
how could i be so cavalier with her emotions ?
you know , we had a real connection .
she gave me her number ,
and right now she &apos;s probably sitting by the phone
waiting for me to call .
i don &apos;t think you understand how charmed she was by me .
oh , my god . where did you get all this self @-@ confidence ?
i won cutest baby at the 1974 jasper county fair .
people at the time said i could go gerber .
you know what ? i &apos;m calling her .
what ?
no , i can &apos;t carry this around .
i have to come clean so she can move on with her life .
this is crazy . she is not waiting--
hi . katie . it &apos;s cam .
first ring .
i was hoping i would call , too .
oh , smooth .
so listen , i forgot to mention something last night ,
and i &apos;m--i &apos;m actually not really quite sure how to say this .
i &apos;m a gay guy .
um , it &apos;s actually somewhat delicate .
as am i , on account of the gay .
no , no , i had a great time with you , too , katie .
it &apos;s--well , it &apos;s just that--
i don &apos;t dig the ladies .
no , no . and i want you to sit--
i want you to have a seat on a chaise lounge .
hey , you wanna go out and
grab some dinner before the fight tonight ?
no , thank you .
wanna eat at home ?
i &apos;ll grill some steaks , open a bottle of wine .
whatever you want , because i &apos;m not going to be here .
she &apos;s going salsa dancing without me .
ay , manny , i told you , it &apos;s a 21 and over club .
a forbidden dance floor . only makes me want it more .
wait a second . you &apos;re going dancing with shorty and darlene ?
yes , because even though he &apos;s old like you ,
he still likes to have fun .
we like to have fun .
last week i took you to dinner ,
went to the boat show ,
got some sherbet ?
and we were home by 8 : 30 with no boat .
what do you want from me ? i don &apos;t like dancing .
i don &apos;t like sherbet .
yeah , right .
how about coconut ?
who doesn &apos;t like the coconut , hmm ? who ?
and anyways , i &apos;m going dancing with or without you .
fine . i hope you have a good time with shorty .
i don &apos;t need shorty !
i won &apos;t have any problem finding a partner on my own !
wow . way to rub it in , mom .
how &apos;d it go , heartbreaker ?
that is one classy lady ...
which is why i couldn &apos;t tell her .
what ?
well ... i just couldn &apos;t do it on the phone .
she seemed so excited to hear from me ,
and i &apos;m very bad at disappointing people , mitchell .
not all people .
mama was right when she said
my charm was like a wild stallion--
if not properly bridled , it &apos;ll bust down a barn .
okay , you wanna get rid of your girlfriend ?
tell her that story .
maybe i will when she comes over . she &apos;s coming over .
are you serious ?
she said she was in the area running errands .
what was i supposed to say , &quot; don &apos;t come over &quot; ?
well , i guess i could have said that ,
but it &apos;s too late now ,
plus i wanna break it to her gently .
so come on . help me un @-@ gay this place .
you know what ? i &apos;ll make it less gay by half .
oh , these flowers should go , too .
you mean the ones underneath
the portrait of you cuddling another man ?
oh , good catch .
manny .
what &apos;s up , big guy ?
how hard is it to learn this salsa dancing stuff ?
not hard at all .
it &apos;s about tapping into your emotion ,
your passion , and your inner fire .
crap !
i stink at dancing .
first dance at our wedding ,
gloria was all graceful and gorgeous ,
and i was all big and clunky .
like that scene from &quot; beauty and the beast . &quot;
actually , that was the song .
manny picked it .
he didn &apos;t like me back then .
back straight . okay .
do as i do .
other leg .
okay , stop marching .
you &apos;re dancing , not invading poland .
hello , hi !
i &apos;m looking for jay pritchett .
he &apos;s about 6 &apos; 2 , &quot; tough guy ,
wrestles with homophobia ...
the hell are you doing here ?
uh , i had to get out of the house .
cam needed a little alone time with his new girlfriend .
don &apos;t ask .
don &apos;t tell .
what &apos;s going on here ?
he &apos;s learning to dance , but he &apos;s just so tense .
it &apos;s not working out .
&apos;cause you &apos;re not letting go .
i &apos;m trying . don &apos;t you think i want to be all smooth
and make your mom happy out there ?
but i just can &apos;t do it , that &apos;s all .
jay , i &apos;m not giving up on you .
okay . hey , manny , would you give us a second ?
thanks .
dad , look , i @-@ i know this is weird ,
but you and i are a lot alike .
we &apos;re self @-@ conscious , okay ?
so , um , here . just ...
the hell is this ?
it &apos;s just something that some people take at clubs
to , you know , loosen up .
you take this ?
a gay man who hates dancing
lives in a sad and lonely little world .
this just melts your inhibitions ,
and--and you can dance all night ,
plus it gives you a raging--
i don &apos;t wanna--
i don &apos;t like this at all .
just hold on to it . just in case .
come on . it &apos;s fine .
jay , i wanna show you something .
a farmer in new zealand taught a pig to dance .
see how he keeps his snout up ?
yep . this is it .
this is what ?
this .
i @-@ i can &apos;t do this . i can &apos;t get out of the car .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m too embarrassed .
would you just tell me what &apos;s going on ?
okay . i @-@ i want you to go read
what &apos;s carved in that tree .
mom , you &apos;re freaking me out .
just do it . do it , haley .
have fun getting home !
there &apos;s your obstacle !
what ? ! are you kidding me ? !
oh ! son of a ...
brisket ! why does that keep happening ?
maybe i need a nail gun .
okay , that &apos;s it ! i &apos;m out !
what do you mean , you &apos;re out ?
where are you going ?
dad , no offense ,
but i &apos;ve seen you with a glue gun .
i think a nail is gonna be harder to get out of my hair .
no , don &apos;t go ! i &apos;m doing this for you !
are you , dad ?
are you ?
the kid made me think with that one .
who was i really doing this for ?
sometimes i just say ,
&quot; are you , dad ? are you ? &quot;
because he gets real quiet
and doesn &apos;t notice when i walk away .
it &apos;s weird ,
because i feel so comfortable around you already .
you know , last night when i got home ,
i just started thinking about
all of the fun things that we could do together , you know ?
yeah .
i don &apos;t wanna scare you off ,
but my sister &apos;s getting married in a couple of weeks ,
and i so don &apos;t wanna go to that thing alone .
maybe you could be my date ?
katie , you &apos;re an amazing woman .
you &apos;re smart , you &apos;re beautiful ,
and how fun is that handbag ?
this is gonna come as a little bit of a shock .
i &apos;m fairly gay .
i don &apos;t know why i said that .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m totally gay .
just gay .
you &apos;re telling me you &apos;re gay ?
yeah .
why ?
i was born that way . i mean , you know , it &apos;s just--
no , why are you telling me ?
i mean , i know you &apos;re gay .
it &apos;s obvious .
well , it &apos;s not that-- it &apos;s not that obvious .
well , yeah .
the way you talk and walk and dress
and your theatrical hand gestures--
i do not have theatrical hand gestures .
okay , maybe i am moderately ... expressive .
but why would you give me your number ?
oh , because i want a gay friend--
someone i can dish with ,
give me guy advice , and i can shop with--
those are totally offensive stereotypes .
we could go see julia roberts movies together .
i know her , and she &apos;s as nice as she seems on screen .
shut up . really ? is she ?
she is , yeah .
wait , what--so you were pretending to be straight ,
and hitting on me ?
i was just a stupid bar bet .
my boyfriend--oh , he &apos;s here ...
bet me that i couldn &apos;t get a beautiful woman &apos;s number .
and as a proud gay man , i know it shouldn &apos;t matter ,
but i @-@ i just wish everyone could find me attractive .
oh . but now he &apos;s gonna get to gloat ,
and i guess i deserve it .
oh my god !
how &apos;s--how &apos;s it going ?
hello .
this is katie , and , uh , it turns out , well ...
才会引起下文的误会 &#93;
no , actually .
it doesn &apos;t turn out well .
because i thought i finally met a nice , funny guy ,
who is also hot !
and now he &apos;s telling me he &apos;s gay ? !
he &apos;s , like , the least gay person i have ever met in my entire life !
and i thought he was the one !
and i even told my mom about him !
you better cherish him !
are you sure you &apos;re gay ?
no .
cam .
yes .
yes . look ...
you &apos;re gonna find somebody ,
because you &apos;re an amazing girl , katie .
you &apos;re the whole package .
i just prefer somebody who has one .
okay .
oh ... my ... god !
that was a lot of girl tongue !
i think i need a drink @-@ a @-@ doodle @-@ doo .
what was that ?
hello , haley . how was your day ?
i have no money , no cell phone ...
you &apos;re welcome .
what ? !
i listened to you .
i stopped coddling you , and look--
you overcame an obstacle .
oh ! yeah ! i did !
i grew up normal despite my crazy mom !
well , that sounds like the beginning of a great essay .
&quot; dear college ... &quot;
oh , honey , if you get stuck , let me know ,
and i &apos;ll make you sleep out in the yard .
you &apos;re psychotic !
use spell check !
don &apos;t just sit there ! get out here !
i &apos;m good , i &apos;m good .
okay !
hola ! you &apos;re looking so good !
how long has it been ?
we don &apos;t know each other . go away .
fair enough .
hola !
you &apos;re looking so good . how long has it been ?
what was wrong with that guy ?
yeah , i would have danced with him .
he &apos;s got nice shoulders .
aw , you know , salsa is so intimate and sensual
that it feels wrong to do it with somebody else that is not jay .
aw . you know , darlene feels the same way .
if i wasn &apos;t here , she &apos;s be holding up the wall .
yeah . a wall of men .
you know , i think i should go home to my loving husband
and pull him close and tell him that i danced with 20 men .
he &apos;s not home .
he &apos;s in a dicey neighborhood
worried about his car .
jay !
what , are we gonna kiss or dance ?
let &apos;s dance !
i &apos;m dead set against drugs .
&quot; just say no &quot; and all that stuff .
but i thought ,
just this once for gloria .
and if i was gonna make a complete ass of myself ,
i didn &apos;t wanna remember it .
the big drug i gave him-- baby aspirin . orange @-@ flavored .
he could have chewed it .
home come you never surprise me like that ?
i do surprise you .
no , you don &apos;t . you never surprise me ...
that &apos;s gonna be a hell of a tree house .
oh , thanks . i &apos;m trying .
it &apos;s for my son , but he &apos;s kind of lost interest .
it &apos;s kind of like my daughter with the dog .
which is why i &apos;m the one out here doing this .
did you just move in ?
lived here eight years . you ?
12 .
you know , me and my friends ,
we , uh , we built a te house when i was a kid .
we spent hours in that thing .
loved it .
me , too .
you need any help ?
yes , a lot .
but i @-@ i don &apos;t wanna bother you .
only thing that bothers me
is that drunken amish roof you got up there .
do you even have a level ?
i did , but i might have gotten frustrated
and thrown it into your yard .
let me find it . i &apos;ll be right over .
thanks .
i &apos;m phil , by the way .
i &apos;m andre . nice to meet you , phil .
nice to meet you , andre .
so i guess i was wrong when i said once you get older ,
it &apos;s harder to make new friends .
hey , honey ! there &apos;s a dude in the tree that &apos;s cool !
andre , it turns out , is an orthopedic surgeon ,
handy with tools , and a great guy to hang out with .
plus he &apos;s a badass black man
that gives me extra street cred .
that &apos;s his joke .
he &apos;s my brotha from a different motha .
what was that ?
different--
that &apos;s not it .
what is it ?
it &apos;s &quot; brother from another mother . &quot;
brotha from anotha motha--
slow down . slow it down .
brotha from another motha .
forget it . don &apos;t-- just don &apos;t say it . forget it .
