饰演的福尔摩斯有着卷发 所以又被粉丝叫 &quot; 卷福 &quot;
you are really killing it tonight , mary ,
and leaving no evidence .
we &apos;re coming from sherlock @-@ con .
it &apos;s like comic @-@ con , but for sherlock holmes fans .
so it &apos;s way cooler .
excuse me for a sec .
there &apos;s another waitress here
who is gonna be a big fan of all of this .
you &apos;re welcome for what i &apos;m about to show you .
look , guess what they are .
time @-@ traveling lesbians .
we &apos;re not lesbians .
i am .
what is this ? what just let out ?
a sale at the burlington coat factory ?
they &apos;re sherlock holmes super @-@ fans
coming from a convention ,
which means there are a lot of cats home alone right now .
well , i &apos;d say the only mystery
is who here gets laid the least .
hello .
cracked it , watson .
one of those sherlock ladies
left her carpal tunnel brace in here .
no address , but there &apos;s a card that says ,
&quot; in case of emergency , dial 1 @-@ 800 @-@ chocolate . &quot;
chocolate对照电话键盘上的字母即是电话号
and i &apos;ll take that .
okay , everybody . it &apos;s that time again--
the diner &apos;s big spring clean !
oh , my god , has it been six years already ?
too bad i just developed carpal tunnel .
能造成手部麻木 无力 疼痛等症状
max , do you think you can fake a stroke ?
fake a stroke , fake an orgasm ,
basically anything that will get me out of work .
okay , we have lots of chores to do ,
and somebody will have to double up ,
because earl asked me not to speak to him
for the rest of the night .
didn &apos;t i tell you to keep my name out your mouth ?
so , girls , what do you say we make it fun , huh ?
i &apos;ll read a chore . you raise your hand .
scrape the fat puddle from under the stove !
no takers ?
next .
clear the spider community in the walk @-@ in !
no takers ?
next .
clear the spider community in the dish room !
no takers ?
han , sorry , i can &apos;t clean . i have carpal tunnel .
the doctor says i can &apos;t put any pressure on my wrist .
and i can &apos;t clean either , han . it &apos;s my jaw .
i &apos;ve got real bad &quot; t.m.z. &quot;
oh , you girls are so full of crap ,
like that third stall in the men &apos;s room .
any takers ?
she was so friendly in the job interview .
bonjour , max .
oh , chef nicolas .
why am i seeing you outside of pastry school ?
is it about my flan ?
because no one likes that stuff anyway .
oh , no , that &apos;s not why i &apos;m here .
i want to speak to caroline .
but , yes , i gave your flan a &quot; c &quot; -minus .
it was flat .
i &apos;ll go get her . wow .
first time a teacher &apos;s ever called me flat .
ow , ow , ow ! oh , my wrist !
oh , i thought you were han .
please , i &apos;m twice the man he is .
nicolas is here .
what ? no , no , no !
he can &apos;t be in my personal life !
i &apos;m having a hard enough time
avoiding working with him at pastry school .
did i just call the diner my personal life ?
i think so . i wasn &apos;t listening .
so what do i tell him ?
tell him he &apos;s married , and i don &apos;t go out with married men .
tell him what we had was a passing flirtation .
tell him now it &apos;s over , and he has to move on .
got it , you died in a grease fire .
she &apos;s not here yet .
oh , well , will she be coming ?
will she be coming ? nope , not anytime soon .
okay , i &apos;ll text her . au revoir , max .
sir , don &apos;t take this the wrong way ,
but you are one fine @-@ looking man .
well , thank you very much .
and back at you .
tell me something i don &apos;t know .
look at this . nicolas already texted me .
&quot; will you have dinner ? &quot; what should i do ?
just ignore it , like i &apos;m doing with that table
that &apos;s flagging me down right now .
i &apos;m putting a stop to this nicolas thing .
&quot; i &apos;ll have dinner with you
when you leave your wife . &quot;
and se @-@ end .
if you ever say &quot; se @-@ end &quot; again ,
we &apos;re not gonna be &quot; fri @-@ ends . &quot;
hey , everybody !
i just got back from sundance .
i saw ten mark ruffalo movies ,
曾出演多部电影 如 《 复仇者联盟 》 《 惊天魔盗团 》
and i got to watch catherine keener dj .
well , whoever that is .
i was in an indie movie once .
well , a guy filmed me eating a sloppy joe
in the dressing room of a sport chalet .
sophie , how did you get into the sundance film festival ?
oh , i &apos;m dating one of the bigwigs .
he drives the miramax party bus ,
and he wears a big wig .
so i &apos;m thinking about producing my own movie .
you know , getting into the biz , babe .
sophie , if you need an actor , let me know .
but i &apos;ll only do full frontal .
i &apos;ll also do partial frontal or just penis close @-@ ups .
and if you need someone to play god , a judge ,
《 虚荣的篝火 》 《 贝拉的魔法 》 中饰演过这些角色
or an old guy sitting on a porch ,
i &apos;m your man .
everyone , keep piping your cakes .
keep piping .
max , vite , vite . you need to pipe that more .
that &apos;s funny , because my high school guidance counselor
told me i need to pipe way less .
max , you are falling behind today .
where &apos;s your deke ?
in my pants , where it always is .
oh , you mean deke .
he &apos;s got the flu . it &apos;s everywhere .
no one can shake it . it &apos;s like taylor swift .
yeah , or pitbull .
okay , everyone , that &apos;s time .
i will see you all tomorrow . au revoir , class .
au revoir , chef .
let &apos;s go . let &apos;s go , let &apos;s go , let &apos;s go , let &apos;s go .
come on , come on , hurry . let &apos;s get outta here .
what &apos;s the hurry ?
you sound like my mother whenever the real people
who lived in the house would come home .
we need to leave now ,
while nicolas is in his office .
i don &apos;t want him to see me .
i said everything i needed to say to him in my last text .
ooh , i smell scandal .
so i &apos;ve been hiding in the stairwell all day .
guess where those stairs go .
a room where ten vietnamese women
are making next year &apos;s &quot; prada . &quot;
and they do not like visitors .
oh , is that where you were ?
&apos;cause he asked me , so i told him you were pooping .
max , don &apos;t tell him i &apos;m pooping !
there &apos;s no shame in it , caroline .
everyone poops .
i don &apos;t .
i just eat , digest , and then an angel comes
and takes it away in the night .
excuse me , john . this is private .
it &apos;s just between us girls .
i know . that &apos;s why i &apos;m standing here .
okay , i &apos;m ready . let me just grab
the medicine i got for deke .
aw , that &apos;s sweet . you got him antibiotics ?
no , i got him vicodin . i want him to feel better .
是处方药 有成瘾性 《 豪斯医生 》 的爱用药
i just have to make it down the hall
until the elevator without nicolas catching me .
oh , like sexual frogger .
game over . your frog just got hit by a car .
caroline , there you are .
i can &apos;t help feeling you &apos;re avoiding me or something .
avoiding you ? no ! i &apos;ve been ...
pooping .
for five hours ?
she had a reluctant stool .
oh , is that not helping ?
caroline , i have something to tell you .
can we talk ?
we &apos;re all waiting .
you know in your text how you said that
you won &apos;t have dinner with me while i &apos;m still married ?
better clear some space on my dvr .
there &apos;s a new scandal .
well , you can have dinner with me ,
because i &apos;m leaving my wife .
uh , hello ? what happened ?
dude told you he was gonna leave his wife ,
and you left faster than vladimir putin at a gay bar .
并可应用到同志或支持同志的外国旅客
it &apos;s all a blur . i blacked out .
i don &apos;t even know how i got here .
i think i took the train , but , max ,
i might have taken the bus .
it came out of nowhere .
i never expected him to leave his wife .
it came out of your thumbs
when you texted it to him .
look , when i texted him that ,
i was just being flirty .
flirty is me not wearing underwear
to the times square m &amp; m store .
so you really don &apos;t want him to leave his wife ?
no !
i mean , sure , maybe i fantasized about it ,
but in my fantasy we were on a ski trip ,
and i was jumping up and down , excited ,
with my best friend jennifer lawrence .
《 美国骗局 》 等 已得过奥斯卡最佳女主与女配奖
cool , maybe call jen next time
the possum traps you by the garbage cans .
look , i thought we were just having a fun distraction .
you know , a couple kisses , a dry hump here and there .
oh , like the cheerleaders with the good grades .
但她们普遍成绩较差 私生活颇为淫乱
exactly . i &apos;m not the type of person
who wants him to leave his wife .
no , you &apos;re the type of person
who almost wants him to leave his wife .
yes ! yes , that &apos;s me !
i &apos;m the &quot; almost &quot; girl .
i almost lost my virginity 25 times .
this was my conversation with my friends
every monday in high school :
&quot; did you ? &quot;
&quot; almost . &quot;
funny , &apos; cause i almost went to high school .
max , i have to figure out what to do about nicolas
before he almost makes a big mistake
and leaves his wife .
he &apos;s not leaving his wife for you .
it &apos;s just a thing you say
to pretty women to get them into bed .
like , &quot; i &apos;m a russian prince , &quot;
or , &quot; that was a good story . &quot;
with a tank top collection like yours ,
i &apos;m surprised you have to say anything .
i know , right ?
so you don &apos;t really think he &apos;s serious about leaving her ?
no . i &apos;ve told dozens of women
i &apos;m leaving my wife for them ,
and i &apos;m not even married .
here in america .
that was nice of oleg .
just when you think you &apos;ve seen every part of a person--
&apos;cause he &apos;s shown you on his phone--
he surprises you .
oh , i feel so much better .
nicolas is not going to leave her .
no , why would he leave her for you ?
well , you don &apos;t have to be nasty about it .
max , i just got another text from nicolas
about him leaving his wife .
oleg , now he says he &apos;s telling his wife
tomorrow at 4 : 00 that he &apos;s leaving her .
you got a timeframe ?
oh , if he puts a clock on it , it &apos;s happening .
pick @-@ up , cantaloupe .
max , there &apos;s a clock on it .
but isn &apos;t his wife in france ?
yeah , but they skype every day .
they &apos;re like the french jetsons .
he &apos;s gonna skype break up with her ?
that is low .
and smart . might steal that move one day .
oh , good , i see your wrist is better ,
and i &apos;m gonna need some help .
the cleaning situation has gotten a little complicated .
the spider communities are at war .
han , i can &apos;t clean .
i &apos;m in the middle of ruining someone &apos;s marriage .
then , max , please . things are escalating quickly .
there was a discarded piece of ham ,
and apparently both kingdoms thought it was theirs .
oh , no takers ?
all right , enough with all this texting .
i need to stop this .
i have to go over to his place tomorrow
and tell him face to face .
tell him face to face ?
i don &apos;t even have sex face to face .
i hope nicolas takes my breaking it off with him okay ,
because in my fantasy when i told him ,
he wouldn &apos;t take no for an answer ,
bought me a plane ,
and i gave jennifer lawrence a ride home .
in my fantasy ,
a talking dragon gave me a cape
that belonged to jesus .
but that &apos;s probably because i took too many
of deke &apos;s vicodin earlier .
the lobby told me you were on your way up .
caroline , i did not expect you .
but you knew i &apos;d be coming ?
we need to talk , and max is here for moral support .
i know how this works by now .
come in .
okay , how do i put this ?
how do i put this ?
nicolas , i came here today to tell you ...
to not do that .
but why ? i want you so much .
okay , you-- you don &apos;t want me .
you don &apos;t even really know me .
i do .
you &apos;re sexy and funny and pretty and smart .
okay , you know me a little .
look , i am not the type of person who breaks up marriages .
no , she &apos;s the &quot; almost &quot; girl .
she almost breaks up marriages .
yes , yes , that &apos;s who i am .
so i don &apos;t want you to make that call
and break up with your wife over skype .
i am not breaking up with her over skype .
okay , great , perfect . no skype .
no .
because that &apos;s her in the lobby .
i &apos;m breaking up with her in person .
oh , my god , that &apos;s your wife in the lobby ?
your wife is here ?
what are we gonna do ?
calm down . i can fix this .
you need a fake mustache , a fistful of paprika ,
and a new passport .
if you don &apos;t have all three of those things ,
i can make it work with two ,
as long as one of them is a mustache .
there &apos;s no other way out .
come on , max , we have to get out of here now .
oh , oh , yeah , and , uh ,
don &apos;t leave your wife for me .
whatever we had , it &apos;s over .
oh , and ...
this shouldn &apos;t reflect badly on me in school ,
&apos;cause i worked hard for that c @-@ minus .
stop , stop , stop , stop , stop , stop , stop .
okay , but only because she just got out of the elevator .
she can &apos;t find me here . i can &apos;t be this girl .
i don &apos;t want to be the whore he &apos;s leaving her for .
that &apos;s my favorite dr. seuss book .
caroline , what are you saying ?
you were just leading me on this whole time ?
hold it , pepe le pew .
and , yes , i &apos;ve been saving that one for after finals .
it is not just caroline .
you &apos;re been chasing after her harder than a fat kid
in a rolling doughnut contest .
that &apos;s true .
wait , wait , caroline .
do we still have a shot or not ?
no .
then better go hide in the bathroom .
i don &apos;t want this screwing up my marriage .
what ?
well , if you &apos;re not going to be with me ,
i &apos;m going to have to stay with my wife .
i mean , i &apos;m a man . i cannot be alone .
now , go , go , go .
she cannot find you here in our apartment .
why don &apos;t you just tell her the truth ,
that nothing happened between us ?
she will not believe me .
i have a history .
there are two of us here .
i also have that history .
nicolas , c &apos;est moi .
now go , please .
that &apos;s the least you can do after ruining my life .
almost . almost ruined your life .
come on , max .
this is totally inconvenient .
my &quot; c &quot; better go up to a &quot; b. &quot;
this is crazy , us hiding in a married man &apos;s bathroom
like a couple of cheap floozies .
so far , i &apos;m just hearing a factual depiction
of what &apos;s happening here .
let me see what &apos;s going on .
i can &apos;t understand them .
i thought you spoke french .
only enough to impress americans .
je dois utiliser les toilettes .
oh , my god . les toilettes .
les toilettes , that &apos;s where we are .
she &apos;s coming in here ! what should we do ?
pretend we &apos;re hot plumbers ?
hide in the shower .
i think she might notice us .
you know that &apos;s all glass , right ?
let me just get you a clean hand towel .
she has to pee @-@ pee .
she can &apos;t come in here to use the toilet ,
&apos;cause my life is in it .
i know , this is unfortunate .
so go out the window .
what ?
it &apos;s not a problem .
there &apos;s a ledge wide enough for you to walk
to the neighbor &apos;s terrace , jump , and get away .
stephanie did it .
who &apos;s stephanie ?
that &apos;s ... not important .
she &apos;s fine .
now go . you have to go .
unless you think you and i still have a shot .
i &apos;ll be on the ledge .
come on , max .
no way , not happening , lucy .
if he loses his bad marriage ,
i &apos;m responsible .
almost . almost responsible .
max , i wouldn &apos;t even be in this situation
if i wasn &apos;t working with him to
put you through pastry school .
oh , so this is my fault ?
max , please just let it be your fault .
it &apos;s completely doable .
by the way , it &apos;s raining .
come on . we can do this .
we &apos;ve crawled 15 feet on our roof
to get illegal cable .
yeah , for the breaking bad finale !
something worth dying for !
oh , my god , are you insane ?
get back in here !
max , maybe you &apos;re right .
we should &apos;ve taken the hot plumber route .
i &apos;m coming back .
my legs won &apos;t go !
max , help me back !
damn it . damn it , bitch .
she &apos;s in the bathroom .
oh , she closed the window .
and she locked it . so go .
go , go !
if stephanie did it , we can too .
i can &apos;t believe we &apos;re up here all because of him .
i am such a bad judge of character .
of course you are . i &apos;m your best friend .
max , i &apos;m sorry . this is bad .
well , at least it can &apos;t get any worse , unless we fall .
oh ! or it starts to hail !
ow ! ow ! hurts like &quot; hail ! &quot;
it &apos;s clear ! come on !
i don &apos;t wanna die !
me neither !
that &apos;s weird .
for the first time in my life , i don &apos;t want to die .
i have a boyfriend and my first &quot; b. &quot;
oh , god , i &apos;m getting soft !
i can &apos;t die ! i haven &apos;t made my comeback yet .
in my fantasy , you and i move into that penthouse
i bought from jennifer lawrence .
right over there , with the roof garden , see ?
are you two all right ?
i mean , whoever you are .
am i dead ?
almost . almost dead .
oh , my god .
what happened to you two ?
well , we crashed through a window .
it was pretty dope .
it was kinda like a die hard movie ,
if they ever let girls do cool stuff in those movies .
the necks all right ?
we have whiplash , and i have some bruises on my back .
max took the brunt of the fall but feels nothing
because she &apos;s mostly made of vicodin .
well , i &apos;m glad you survived ,
because i don &apos;t know what i would do
without you around here .
aw , thanks , earl .
i meant you .
i know .
max , how were you ever strong enough
to hold me up with one arm ?
it &apos;s the arm i used to drag my mother
out of bars with as a baby .
well , i want to say something to you .
i hope you know that if you were the one
that slipped on that ledge--
i would be dead .
well , i &apos;m glad that &apos;s out in the open .
hey , everybody !
i have an update about my life !
what happened to you two ?
sophie , we had an accident . it &apos;s a long story .
yeah , all of yours are .
well , i &apos;m out of the movie business .
i broke up with my bigwig from miramax .
we got in a huge fight ,
and he threw his big wig at me .
he told me i &apos;d never eat lunch in this town again .
and i said ,
&quot; hey , if i &apos;m in town ,
i &apos;m eating lunch , baby ! &quot;
oh , no . no , no , no ,
i don &apos;t have spider bites over half my body
so you two could fake another injury .
nice try .
ooh , i &apos;ll bet that hurts .
