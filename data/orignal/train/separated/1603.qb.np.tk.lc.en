i &apos;m always gonna have feelings for you .
but i don &apos;t trust you .
nothing &apos;s fine right now including my marriage .
i don &apos;t even know what that little kiss was about . it was nothing .
i remember a young man , african @-@ american , got on the bus ,
blood all over his shirt and face .
that &apos;s joe olsen ...
the son of the owner of the s.u.v. that hit the kids .
but didn &apos;t you say the guy on the bus was black ?
yeah , but this joe olsen shows up in this pharmacy
40 minutes after the accident ?
i &apos;m sorry , but that &apos;s not coincidence .
yeah , i got my g.e.d. and i join the army in two weeks .
congratulation carmen.that &apos;s been your goal for , like , so long .
brooke and me were in a fight .
and rita came upstairs . and then she hit me .
brooke ?
no . rita .
i never laid a hand on her .
it &apos;s true . rita punched her in the face .
so i just decided i &apos;m gonna wait to join the army
after i graduate high school .
but you got your g.e.d. ?
yeah , if the army didn &apos;t work out .
she can probably get a better job with a high school diploma .
you wanna share the other reason ?
i guess ...
i &apos;m also sorta shaken up about rita hitting me .
why are you lying ?
i &apos;m not .
brooke hit you . why are you covering for her ?
why is she in group ?
she &apos;s not even part of the program .
everyone who lives here participates in group .
what &apos;s she got on you , carmen ?
you know , i don &apos;t appreciate the accusation .
she wasn &apos;t talking to you .
yeah , let her talk .
why , carmen ? after everything that rita &apos;s done for you .
i don &apos;t get it .
you don &apos;t have to get it , bitch .
you the bitch .
hey , hey , hey ! kiara , brooke ,
that &apos;s a u.a. for both of you .
like , i don &apos;t even think carmen would even cover for brooke .
she hates her .
and what would i have on her , okay ?
she &apos;s foreman , she &apos;s got all her privileges .
she &apos;s like the g.u. poster girl .
but i gotta say , the army &apos;s gonna be your job .
why doesn &apos;t she want to get the hell out of here ?
yeah , why don &apos;t you want to get out of here , carmen ?
can we just be done with me ?
can &apos;t somebody else talk ?
okay .
dee .
going home for the weekend .
how are you feeling about that ?
so the bus driver lets off a bleeding , agitated guy
in front of a pharmacy .
and a little while later ...
in walks joe olsen .
so ?
so what if this guy is a friend of joe &apos;s ?
what if joe lends his father &apos;s car to the guy ,
he runs a red light ,
hits ana and the twins in the volvo ,
and takes off ?
so he goes down the alley , gets on the bus ...
and gets off in front of the pharmacy , calls joe .
joe comes and sees that his friend is bleeding ,
goes into the pharmacy to get bandages or whatever .
yeah , but , i mean ...
he could have gotten them for himself .
he &apos;s got that cut over the eye .
no , no , no . that &apos;s not a fresh cut .
that &apos;s not a fresh cut .
and what is he doing in linda vista 30 minutes after the accident
when he told us that he was at work ?
you &apos;ve got an interesting theory , stef , but , i mean ,
there &apos;s no way to i.d. the guy on the bus
or connect him to olsen .
so ...
so what you &apos;re saying ...
you have an interesting theory .
hey , you all set ?
yeah .
we &apos;re gonna miss you around here .
i &apos;m gonna miss y &apos;all too .
and thank you for everything y &apos;all did for me .
we were happy to do it , a.j.
you &apos;re leaving ?
yeah , mike finally got his foster license .
don &apos;t be a stranger .
i won &apos;t .
you okay ?
yeah .
i &apos;ll talk to you later .
okay . let &apos;s go . bye .
bye , y &apos;all .
this sucks .
i mean , jesus is at boarding school ,
callie &apos;s at girls united , jude &apos;s at camp ,
and brandon &apos;s , like , never here .
it &apos;s like i &apos;m an only child .
woe is you .
woe is me .
and no one even cares how i feel .
that was callie &apos;s social worker .
yeah , is she coming home ?
nope .
apparently , after she spoke with callie and brandon ,
she found some inconsistencies she would like to discuss with us .
you &apos;ve got pretty hair .
thanks .
you &apos;ve got a pretty face , too .
is that what you came in here to tell me ?
how pretty i am ?
i want you gone .
you &apos;re not on probation , you don &apos;t got to be here .
but i want to be here .
i &apos;m getting out of here in a few weeks ,
and if that doesn &apos;t happen because of you ,
my boyfriend &apos;s gonna cut that pretty little face of yours .
why are you so worried about me ...
if you didn &apos;t hit carmen ?
i &apos;m not worried about you .
i just don &apos;t like you .
that hurts my feelings .
you think this is a joke ?
no .
i think you are .
as you all know ,
on saturday , you &apos;ll be performing ...
i need ten hours with jin .
ten ? and when do i get him ?
mornings and nights .
and you get days ?
i have to drive back and forth .
that &apos;s not my problem .
excuse me , gentlemen .
you might want to pay attention .
sorry .
what the judges are looking for is the &quot; goose bump &quot; factor .
so , composers , please work with your pianist &apos;s performance .
the passion of the play , not just the proficiency .
okay ? let &apos;s get to work . clock &apos;s ticking .
six hours .
six hours ? that sucks .
you wouldn &apos;t be here if it wasn &apos;t for me .
yeah , and you wouldn &apos;t have a prepared piano piece
if you hadn &apos;t ripped me off .
brandon , can i get a word ?
sure .
you had a rough start here at idyllwild .
well , yeah , but that &apos;s because ...
you have a big ego .
that &apos;s a good thing to have as an artist . embrace it .
and know that you &apos;re exceptional .
thank you .
do you believe you can win this thing ?
do you ?
i mean , yes . yes , i do .
good .
so do i.
what kind of inconsistencies ?
she didn &apos;t say .
she wants to talk to some of the girls
that were here with you at the same time .
the only girls left are daphne and kiara .
and carmen .
how &apos;s it going with her ?
fine .
and brooke ?
yeah .
hopefully , this is the last hurdle we have to jump over
and then you can come home .
have you heard what &apos;s happening with rita ?
no .
no charges have been brought against her .
so far , as far as i know , the d.a. is still investigating , so ...
carmen &apos;s lying .
i think that you &apos;re probably right ,
but it &apos;s not your job to find out why .
okay ? you have to keep your head down
until we can get you home .
you cannot get into it with these girls .
just a few days till the court date .
this time next week , you &apos;ll be adopted .
no one can take you away from us ever again .
i love you .
i love you , too .
you hang in there .
she &apos;s been at my place almost every night .
i mean , the sex is great .
really great .
i can hear you .
and i really don &apos;t want to picture the principal of my school
having sex with one of my mom &apos;s friends .
please .
sorry . sorry !
the thing is , monte ,
she &apos;s not like your typical lesbian .
she doesn &apos;t talk about her feelings .
i think it &apos;s because she &apos;s used to dating guys .
so she &apos;s playing her cards really close to her chest .
and it &apos;s a great chest .
let me tell you .
okay , i &apos;m gonna go upstairs .
mm , it was great to see you , sweetheart .
the thing is , i am falling in love with this woman .
and i don &apos;t even know if she &apos;s in love with me .
so what do i do ?
hey , uh , can we rent me a room
up in idyllwild for the next two days ?
uh , can you say hello to jenna ?
oh , hi , jenna .
hey . monte and i are driving up to watch you perform .
we are very excited .
uh , yeah , i &apos;m actually ... i &apos;m not performing ,
i &apos;m composing .
uh , i just ... i don &apos;t want to be losing all this time ,
you know , driving up and back .
let me talk to mom about it when she gets back , okay ?
okay . all right , i &apos;ll be in the garage .
hey , don &apos;t eat all those chips before dinner .
we &apos;re about to have dinner !
you know what ?
i have a friend who has a cabin in idyllwild .
i bet you he &apos;d let us use it .
us ?
yeah .
brandon could stay there tomorrow night ,
and then ,
the rest of us could drive up on friday night
and we could spend the whole weekend there
like a little mini couples getaway .
wouldn &apos;t that be fun ? i &apos;m gonna call her right now .
you still think i &apos;m a joke ?
next time , you &apos;ll bleed .
you &apos;re lucky that crazy meth head didn &apos;t run you down , girl .
how is brooke even talking to her boyfriend ?
you found a way when you were here .
she &apos;s getting drugs from him too .
in g.u. ?
i think you gotta bounce .
what about rita ?
okay , girls . lights out .
look , we got your back ,
but we can &apos;t watch it every minute of the day .
she &apos;s right .
don &apos;t you think it &apos;s weird
carmen decided to wait to join the army ?
i don &apos;t know .
maybe she realized she &apos;s not the hard @-@ ass she thought she was .
excuse me .
i got a call about my grandma .
iris hensdale ?
they said she had a stroke .
a.j.
hey , grandma .
how you doin &apos; ?
i &apos;m just fine .
do you see a man standing over there ?
yeah .
okay . good .
that &apos;s mike .
he &apos;s my new foster father .
you take care of my grandson .
i will .
so , i , uh , i did some research .
and i found out that
when you take your physical to get into the army ,
they drug test you .
that &apos;s why getting your high school diploma
was suddenly so important .
&apos;cause you were afraid that if you didn &apos;t wait a few months ,
then you would test positive for crystal meth .
that &apos;s why you and brooke were fighting ,
because you took her drugs .
why , carmen ?
you were so close to getting what you wanted .
why did you use ?
i don &apos;t ... i don &apos;t know .
i was having a bad day .
i just wanted to get high .
so you made a mistake .
why lie about rita ?
because if i said that brooke hit me , then she would have told .
and if i test positive for drugs at any time
during the application process , then that &apos;s it .
you can never join the army .
so , you have other options .
no , i don &apos;t .
when you &apos;re in a gang ,
they don &apos;t just let you leave .
so what about rita ?
she could lose everything .
you don &apos;t care about her at all .
i &apos;ve got to care about me .
my mom &apos;s a cop . she could drug test you right now .
if you out me ,
i will out you to that social worker who &apos;s coming to talk to us .
what do you think will happen
if i tell her you and brandon snuck around ,
seeing each other the whole time you were here ?
what about you shoving your tongue
down his throat at the fundraiser ?
you still think you &apos;ll get adopted ?
i thought we were friends .
i don &apos;t have any friends .
and don &apos;t think for a second
i won &apos;t take you down with me .
okay , stop , stop .
you &apos;re not playing with any passion .
well , it &apos;s a very difficult piece .
right , don &apos;t worry so much about the technique .
just ... you know what tempo rubato is , right ?
of course , but it says allegro .
don &apos;t be so literal . yeah , you just ...
feel the music .
maybe if you told me what the piece was about .
um , okay . it &apos;s about ...
falling in love with someone you can never be with .
why not ?
well , because sometimes it just doesn &apos;t work out .
but why ?
uh ... have you ever been in love ?
uh ... no .
have you ever had a relative die ?
no .
a pet ?
no .
has anything bad ever happened to you ?
not really .
my wisdom teeth got impacted .
okay , let &apos;s start again .
no offense , but this piece is sort of a waste of my time .
a waste of your time ?
what i mean is that ...
you don &apos;t think i can win this .
no . i mean yes .
maybe . i don &apos;t know .
but i don &apos;t think i can play this piece that you want me to .
then don &apos;t .
you are obviously loyal to tony .
well ...
don &apos;t say you &apos;re switzerland again .
okay .
so what am i doing ?
you &apos;re getting the hell out of here .
so ...
how &apos;s it going ?
well , someone had to stay
to drive callie and mariana up tomorrow .
why did that someone get to be you ?
because i didn &apos;t make the plan .
i &apos;m here .
have fun .
i &apos;ll see you tomorrow . love you .
love you too .
oh , it &apos;s beautiful up here .
right ?
it &apos;s nice to have friends with friends with cabins .
where &apos;s jenna ?
she had some p.r. crisis ,
so she &apos;s gonna drive up tonight .
well , brandon is rehearsing , so i guess it &apos;s just us for dinner .
well , i brought grass @-@ fed , antibiotic @-@ free ,
practically healthy steaks .
oh , i brought ...
a six pack of wine .
it was buy five , get one free .
what am i gonna do ?
i mean , this whole experience has sucked from day one .
i mean , i thought this was a camp , not a competition .
and i thought i was here to play piano .
so do it . play piano .
i can &apos;t play my own piece . they won &apos;t let me .
then don &apos;t ask .
well , and also , i just technically can &apos;t play it . okay ?
i don &apos;t have the reach .
i mean , since my hand got crushed in a car door ...
oh , so what you want is to feel sorry for yourself .
is that it ?
oh , thank you for your support .
hey ! hey , come on , don &apos;t be ...
i took a day off tour to come support you ,
but if you just wanna whine , that &apos;s okay too .
seriously , this piece i wrote is just very difficult .
okay ? i would need , like , an extra hand to do it .
that can be reached .
so if carmen tells the social worker that i kissed brandon
a few months ago , i &apos;ll never get adopted .
okay , look . rita hasn &apos;t been charged yet .
she may never be .
it &apos;s not like you have any proof .
it &apos;s still gonna be your word against carmen &apos;s .
no , it won &apos;t .
i recorded her .
on what ?
you got your phone ?
yeah .
stef got michelle to let me have it if i kept it a secret .
so ...
i recorded her saying that brooke hit her .
so i can &apos;t help noticing you &apos;re still here .
callie &apos;s leaving tomorrow . you good with that ?
tomorrow works .
oh , excuse me . i don &apos;t think you signed in .
i &apos;m leaving now .
it &apos;s our policy , all visitors have to sign in .
i &apos;ll stick around ,
till gram is out of the woods .
then i &apos;m gone .
please don &apos;t go , ty .
you can stay here ,
and we can see each other anytime .
you made your choice .
ty , hold up !
look ,
i &apos;m not trying to get between you and your brother ...
you already did .
i &apos;m just trying to give him a home .
i &apos;m his home !
well , then stay . he needs you .
take care of him .
hey , ty , hold up .
good luck .
how you doin &apos; ?
take care .
everything all right ?
yeah . yeah , i tried to talk to him .
uh , listen , i left my jacket inside . i &apos;ll be right back .
wait , what about senorita rosarita rochin ?
what about her wig , more importantly ?
it &apos;s always a little out of kilter .
but , you know , she &apos;s an excellent teacher .
totally . she is .
yes .
so , um , how are things going with jenna ?
well ...
i like her , a lot .
so ...
i don &apos;t know , i think her feelings might be
progressing a little faster than mine .
and , um ...
how are you finding dating a woman ,
in general ?
it &apos;s different .
um . yeah , it &apos;s ...
i like the emotional connection , and um , i like ...
i like having sex with a woman .
there &apos;s that .
there &apos;s that .
okay , well ,
maybe , you know , you just need a little more time .
maybe . or , you know , maybe she &apos;s just not the right woman for me .
now , if i thought i had a chance with senorita ...
rosarita rochin .
i was gonna end up saying ...
what &apos;s so funny ?
nothing .
how was your drive ?
it was fine .
yeah ? was there a lot of traffic ?
it was long .
it was long ? yeah .
how about a glass of wine ?
yes .
yes , you do .
yes , you need to catch up .
yeah , i could definitely use a ... drink .
if everyone could please take their seats , we &apos;re about to begin .
how &apos;s mike &apos;s ? you miss us ?
no .
maybe a little .
congratulations , by the way .
so when are you coming to see me ?
... composers and performers ,
they &apos;ve worked very hard this summer .
and not only are they playing for you ,
they are competing for a chance ...
sorry i &apos;m late .
where &apos;s monte ?
she left .
why ?
we broke up .
our first performer is cellist tori phillips .
hey , uh , what &apos;d you decide on joe olsen ?
uh , i brought him in .
oh , yeah ?
mm @-@ hmm .
did you get anything out of him ?
nope . no , i think you &apos;re right .
there &apos;s no way to connect him to the guy in the bus .
my theory &apos;s a little out there , you know .
what ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
i &apos;m just nervous about brandon .
okay . certainly not as nerve racking
as it was when he was performing though , right ?
yeah .
what ?
mat .
what &apos;s he doing here ?
our next composer is brandon foster ,
and you may recognize his pianist , jin chang .
although i &apos;m on the composing track at idyllwild ,
i decided to play my own piece .
i realize that i might be
disqualified from the competition ,
but i didn &apos;t come up here to idyllwild to win .
i came here to learn from my teachers
and from my peers ,
not to compete against them .
what &apos;s he doing ?
kicking some ass .
i had a hard time this summer
because i got all caught up
in trying to prove that i belonged here ,
that i lt the joy of making music .
i &apos;d like to reclaim that now ,
and do what i love most .
perform .
what &apos;s he doing ?
is he capable of playing his own piece ?
quite a looping pedal he has .
i &apos;m so proud of you , my baby .
share him with me .
congratulations .
you were awesome .
i couldn &apos;t have done it without you , man .
you were brilliant .
yeah .
it was really nice of you
to come out and support brandon .
yeah , well ...
are you ...
i &apos;ve gotta ...
hit the road . so ...
oh , you &apos;re ...
yeah .
well , drive safely .
i will .
see ya , mariana .
see ya .
i &apos;m so proud of you .
thanks , dad .
that was dope , man .
thank you . i heard you moved in .
yeah .
yeah .
well , he &apos;s a good dad .
he &apos;ll be a good foster dad , too .
and , uh ... you know ,
i &apos;ll try to be a good foster brother .
i appreciate that .
brandon , that was incredible .
i don &apos;t understand how ...
yeah , it &apos;s like a looper .
it &apos;s like a looping machine .
essentially , you can put multiple tracks ...
can i talk to you for a second ?
yeah .
um , i just got an email .
it looks like the d.a.
is gonna be charging rita with assault
and abuse of a minor .
i &apos;m sorry .
hey . i &apos;m taking off .
hey .
okay , hold on a second . i will be right back .
okay ?
come here .
这样你就可以洗脱罪名
这样你就可以洗脱罪名了 爱你 凯丽
so what &apos;s going on ?
i &apos;m sorry , i don &apos;t ...
i don &apos;t want to be such a bummer .
it &apos;s okay . what happened ?
i don &apos;t know if i should tell you this .
what ?
monte and i broke up because ...
she has feelings for somebody else .
oh , honey . who ?
that took a lot of balls ,
and your piece is amazing .
thank you , but you &apos;re gonna win .
well , you won the moral victory .
if i could please have everyone &apos;s attention again .
the judges have made their final decisions .
i will start with the winning composer .
the composer and pianist
who will be performing at disney hall ...
is brandon foster .
oh , my god ! brandon ! brandon !
oh , my god !
brandon !
so proud of you !
how are the designated drivers ?
you &apos;re the designated driver .
moms left us up here to keep an eye on brandon ,
make sure he doesn &apos;t over @-@ celebrate .
it &apos;s weird they went home .
i mean , i get it .
you know , when you &apos;re not feeling well ,
you just want to be in your own bed .
i wanna be in my own bed .
i &apos;m so bored ...
ah , mariana .
can i talk to you ?
how bored are you now ?
i thought you left .
i did , but then i turned around and came back .
for what ?
i know why you broke up with me .
when i extended the tour , i made you feel like
that was more important to me than you .
but nothing &apos;s more important .
i want to spend the rest of the summer with you
if it &apos;s not ... too late .
you having fun ?
yeah . i guess ,
you drunk ?
no , no , no . i &apos;m just pretending .
i didn &apos;t want to ruin how good i feel .
well , you deserve it .
you know , you worked really hard .
your composition was beautiful .
i couldn &apos;t have written it a year ago .
so we haven &apos;t talked about a.j.
it &apos;s none of my business who you date .
i &apos;m not dating him .
okay , well , kiss on your birthday then .
hey , can i ask you something ?
did you come to girls united
the other night ?
no .
why ?
i just , um ... i thought i saw your car outside .
hey , so ...
i &apos;m kind of embarrassed to tell you this .
what ?
the reason why i didn &apos;t want to have sex with you
wasn &apos;t just because i was leaving .
i wanted it to be special .
i know .
you told me that .
yeah , but i didn &apos;t tell you why .
i &apos;ve ... never had sex before .
i want my first time to be with the right girl .
and i wanted us to lose our virginity together .
you know ?
somewhere romantic .
like here .
like now .
if you want to .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i &apos;m not a virgin .
but you ... you told me ...
i was , but ...
i had sex with someone else .
when ?
when we were still together .
thanks for doing this .
no problem . what am i looking for ?
any prints off the pen
that match the ones on a hit @-@ and @-@ run vehicle .
case number &apos;s on the bag .
okay . it might take a few days .
no problem . appreciate it .
all right , you got it .
honey ?
in here .
what are you doing in here ?
waiting for you .
does your head still hurt ? are you okay ?
yeah , my head is fine .
i just didn &apos;t want to ruin brandon &apos;s day .
why would you ruin it ?
are you having an affair with monte ?
no .
are you in love with her ?
no !
so there &apos;s nothing going on between the two of you ?
why are you askinge that ?
why don &apos;t you just answer me ?
there &apos;s nothing going on .
what about when you kissed ?
i did not kiss her .
she kissed me .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
because i didn &apos;t want to upset you .
you know , i feel like an absolute idiot .
i &apos;ve had that woman in our house ...
nothing is going on . nothing has ever gone on .
how about in front of the fire , last night ,
just the two of you ?
no .
well , jenna said that she thinks monte &apos;s in love with you ,
and that &apos;s why they broke up .
oh , god .
jenna is being paranoid .
monte may not be in love with her ,
but it &apos;s not because she &apos;s in love with me .
you know , it &apos;s really incredible
because you &apos;ve given me such a hard time
about keeping things from you .
you know , even in therapy .
and yet , here you are sitting on
the mother of all secrets .
it was a kiss .
it lasted a second .
i was surprised , i pulled away ,
and i made it very clear to her
that i am in love with my wife .
i should have told you about it because it was nothing .
if it was nothing , i think you would have told me .
mariana is in her room alseep .
is she alone ?
yeah .
i wonder what happened to mat .
i don &apos;t know ,
but they left this nice fire .
so there &apos;s something i have to tell you
before everything hits the fan .
okay .
you know about carmen accusing rita of hitting her ?
yeah .
so she didn &apos;t .
and i have a recording of carmen admitting that she lied .
i sent it to rita
to clear her .
well , that &apos;s good , right ?
yeah . yeah , it &apos;s good for rita .
it &apos;s not so good for me
or you , sort of ,
because ...
carmen knows that i kissed you
at the fundraiser ...
and that we saw each other when i was at g.u. ,
and she &apos;s gonna tell my social worker everything .
can &apos;t you just deny it ?
yeah , i can .
but i didn &apos;t deny it in the recording .
so now rita knows too .
and i &apos;m pretty much screwed .
the judge will never let lena and stef adopt me .
and they &apos;re probably gonna be a little mad at you too ,
so , um ...
i &apos;m sorry about that .
i just ... i couldn &apos;t let rita go to jail
and lose everything that she &apos;s worked so hard for .
and she didn &apos;t do anything wrong ,
and the truth is , we did .
i did .
i hope you understand .
i don &apos;t care about me .
what &apos;s gonna happen to you ?
i can &apos;t go back to g.u. ,
so ...
hopefully , i can live with my dad .
callie , there must be ...
no , it &apos;s just wasn &apos;t meant to be .
none of it ,
i guess , was meant to be .
* it came like a cloud *
* covered every doubt *
