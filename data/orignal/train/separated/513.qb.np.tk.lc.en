the hunt
my sister and brother @-@ in @-@ law died in 9 @-@ 11 .
they had a baby girl , meg .
she &apos;s 13 and the light of my life .
i love you , sweet girl .
omg , he messaged us back .
bobby &apos;s so hot .
he &apos;s asking for a picture .
his mom is gonna pick us
up and he &apos;s gonna meet us at the concert .
hi . you must be meg and markayla .
i &apos;m paige , bobby &apos;s mom .
hop in .
you both look great .
um , ms. miller ?
i thought the concert was downtown .
we &apos;re meeting bobby there , right ?
um , ms. miller , can you stop for a minute ?
i think i left something at the library .
what &apos;s going on ?
i don &apos;t know .
what are you doing ? let us out !
markayla !
oh , my god , meg ! let go of me !
no ! let go of me !
help us !
help !
although the observable universe
is continually expanding , there &apos;s really no way of knowing
if the whole thing is gonna ultimately collapse
into one gargantuan black hole .
wow , there &apos;s actually something our little genius doesn &apos;t know .
i will tell you one thing for sure .
my universe is expanding
and it is pretty frickin &apos; stormy .
gotta love nausea and vertigo .
which is why i got you these .
you &apos;re the best .
what &apos;s up ?
i &apos;m not sure . it &apos;s meg .
have a panic code , &quot; pepper , &quot; and ...
i just got a text from her saying &quot; pepp . &quot;
maybe it &apos;s just an accident ?
hey , this is meg . please leave a message .
damn it . straight to voicemail .
meg still acting out ?
hello .
hi . caroline , this is kate .
can i talk to meg ?
she &apos;s not here .
markayla told me she was gonna be working on her ...
science project at my house .
dear lord , what are those two up to ?
i don &apos;t know , but they could be in trouble .
can you just conference in markayla ?
uh , sure .
this is markayla . you know the drill .
it &apos;s going straight to voicemail . what &apos;s going on ?
ok , stay put . i &apos;m gonna have agents there asap .
agents ?
kate ? kate .
welcome to the dark forest .
enter at your own risk .
i &apos;m gonna need you to track meg
and her best friend &apos;s cell phones .
yeah , sure . what &apos;s up ?
i &apos;m not sure , but i just sent you the numbers .
ok , ok . uh ...
it looks like they were both outside the library ,
pinging local towers up until ...
then the gps cuts out a couple blocks away .
ok , that &apos;s weird . we &apos;re gonna have to contact their friends ,
check texts , surveillance ...
you got it . you got it .
reid just filled me in .
are you sure they didn &apos;t just sneak out ?
meg wouldn &apos;t do that . she knew to only use that code
if her life was in danger .
all right , i &apos;ll mobilize the c.a.r.d. team .
kate--
look , i already know what you &apos;re gonna say ,
that i &apos;m way too far along to go out on this case .
you should be at home with chris in case you get a call .
that is my kid out there . i &apos;m not going anywhere . i &apos;ve got this .
&quot; the world will not be destroyed by those who do evil ,
but by those who watch without doing anything . &quot;
albert einstein .
because of our work , i created very strict rules for meg .
that stress code , it was given for a reason .
canning , i just sent you the gps coordinates
of their last known position .
set up neighborhood canvasses and roadblocks .
on it .
it &apos;s not good .
i just got a shot of the girls , uh ,
from a video feed across the street from the library .
oh , my god .
baby girl , capture that plate right there .
i already did . searching .
and look at the time stamp .
i got meg &apos;s text two minutes later .
ok , plates are stolen and i &apos;ve got no shot of the driver .
issue the amber alert with the girls &apos; pictures
and the description of the van .
anything in the girls &apos; email accounts ?
this is really discombobulated .
i &apos;ve got no text data or calls
from the cell phone company servers for either of the girls .
ok , so whoever took them planned this
and got rid of their texts .
we &apos;re still up in the air about m.o.
most likely scenario , she was lured via social networking .
i &apos;ll have facebook push the amber alert .
all right , jj , you and dave go to the davises&apos;
and check out markayla &apos;s computer .
you two talk to friends .
and garcia and i will come to your house , kate .
a stranger &apos;s van ?
that &apos;s crazy . why would meg do that ?
remember that date she had with her classmates at the mall ?
yeah , but she was stood up by bobby and tyler .
what if it wasn &apos;t real ?
wait , what do you mean ?
garcia , can you check meg and markayla &apos;s class list
for boys named bobby and tyler ?
yeah .
there &apos;s no robert , bob , or a ty either .
see ? it was a setup .
so someone &apos;s been stalking our kid ?
your being there that night saved them .
this can &apos;t be happening .
help the agents with the missing flyers
and i &apos;m gonna go through her things .
yeah , yeah .
garcia , can you see
if meg has been emailing any boys .
anything missing ?
yeah , something &apos;s wrong .
what &apos;s markayla &apos;s relationship with meg like ?
best friends . inseparable .
do you think someone kidnapped them ?
we don &apos;t know yet .
rossi .
hey , did markayla take her good clothes with her ?
yeah , and some of her mom &apos;s makeup , too .
meg took her favorite jean jacket and boots .
these girls were definitely planning on meeting boys ,
just maybe not the ones that they thought .
what have you got ?
uh , it &apos;s a ghost town .
the hard drives are wiped clean .
there &apos;s no instant messenger or skype history .
there &apos;s not even a user name .
dave , can you turn on markayla &apos;s computer
so garcia can scan it .
powering up now .
ok , i got it .
zilch on markayla &apos;s , too .
these perps are thoroughly thorough .
aaron , they took the two girls at once .
this must be an abduction team .
how are they ?
resting .
has he called ?
not yet .
that doesn &apos;t have to stop us from getting started .
chris .
what is it ?
i need you to go to the mall
and buy another jean jacket .
why ?
we &apos;re going to use it for the missing flyers
to show what meg was last seen in .
you really think that &apos;ll make a difference ?
yes . we use it to reconstruct the--
the victim ...
kate . kate ! kate !
i got you . i got you .
you need to lay down .
come on .
sam , did meg or markayla ever mention
talking to anyone new online ?
i &apos;m not sure .
sam , their lives may be in great danger .
what do you know ?
markayla met this really cute guy .
he like her instagram pictures .
and when was this ?
a few months ago . she and meg wouldn &apos;t stop talking about him .
they emailed him every day .
you know his name ?
bobby , i think . but i don &apos;t know his last name .
meg kept telling markayla to slow down ,
but markayla was head over heels .
they both were .
you ever seen a picture of bobby ?
they sent it to me . i erased my phone .
but i may have saved it to the cloud .
she &apos;s ok . the doctors want her on bed rest for now .
kate , you have to be very careful .
i need to find meg .
you &apos;re no good to anyone if you pass out .
garcia will set up video conferencing .
what ? what is it ?
morgan confirmed that the boy
that meg and markayla went to meet was named bobby .
do they have his number ?
no , just a picture .
what &apos;s wrong ?
do you know that kid ?
no . but i know who took them .
markayla .
markayla ! markayla .
are you ok ?
where are we ?
no idea .
oh , my god .
what are they gonna do to us ?
i don &apos;t know .
they must have been pretending to be bobby .
why would they do that ?
maybe they want to sell us ?
don &apos;t say that .
help ! somebody--
shh . that &apos;s not gonna work .
we gotta make a plan .
go ahead , kate .
after we closed the riverside torso case ,
i couldn &apos;t let it go , so i revisited the crime scenes
and starting asking questions .
aaron , you looked at that case , too ,
and the evidence indicated
the torso killer was working alone .
kate &apos;s working a different tangent .
i also kept tabs on missing women .
there was a female jogger in modesto , eileen banks ,
categorized as voluntary missing ,
but oddly killed in a car accident a few weeks later
all the way in maryland . she was never autopsied .
how is that related to this ?
she had been flirting on line with a young new boyfriend
before she ran off , but it was the same bobby
in that picture from sam .
it must have been the same group that took the girls .
if this is related to that case ,
then these abductors are mobile .
we &apos;ll get an emergency warrant ,
we &apos;ll exhume the jogger &apos;s body and do an autopsy .
i &apos;ll expedite it with judge lynch .
they were taken because of me .
i was getting close .
you were doing your job , kate .
the unsub knew that grabbing an fbi agent &apos;s daughter
would bring a firestorm down upon him .
he &apos;s an extreme risk @-@ taker .
ok , i got the 411 on this bobby photo .
it originated 6 years ago .
guy &apos;s name is sven sorensen , from sweden .
he &apos;s now 25 . he still lives in europe .
they used the picture to lure the girls .
whoever did this is most likely not a pedophile ,
but rather a preferential adult offender
and long @-@ term child abductor .
but he targeted the girls .
yeah , because i was targeting him .
i don &apos;t know , meg . i don &apos;t know .
if we don &apos;t , we &apos;re not getting out of here alive .
i can &apos;t .
you have to .
shut up ! time to go .
why are you doing this to us ?
you don &apos;t have to hurt us .
please , we &apos;ll be good .
shut up .
let &apos;s go .
meg ! meg !
no--let go of me !
not only did they wipe the girls &apos; devices clean ,
they went after kate because
she was digging into missing persons cases .
because kate was onto something .
yeah , this isn &apos;t some loner who wants to keep girls in a dungeon .
this feels like trafficking .
that &apos;s the worst @-@ case scenario .
well , if it is trafficking , the upside is
we &apos;ve got a better chance of finding the girls alive .
yeah , but if they don &apos;t comply ,
they &apos;ll be beaten into submission
or killed if they try to escape .
it went better than expected .
you know , you &apos;ve never let me down , paige .
you &apos;ll always be my most prized possession .
show me .
get up .
sit up .
they &apos;re perfect .
and no visible bruising .
you &apos;re learning .
i know what i &apos;m doing .
let &apos;s go .
get rid of the van ,
meet us back at home in about two hours .
markayla , run !
kyle !
you watch that one .
kyle !
over here !
where the hell is she ?
you let her get away ?
it &apos;s dark . she &apos;s fast .
you idiot .
you &apos;ve always been a moron .
don &apos;t talk to me like that . i &apos;ve warned you--
help me ! help me , please ! let me in !
get away from my house .
i &apos;ve a gun . i &apos;ll shoot !
help me ! help me , please !
oh , god , honey , what happened ?
she &apos;s frightened and in shock ,
but doctors say she &apos;ll be fine .
markayla .
mom !
he killed him .
he killed him right in front of me .
it &apos;s ok , markayla . you &apos;re ok now .
but we need to know , who were you meeting at the library ?
it was supposed to be bobby .
we were talking to him for a few months online .
he seemed so cool .
he said he had tickets to the 4 for 1 concert tonight ,
but he got stuck at work ,
so his mom picked us up instead .
and she was driving the van ?
yes . and she seemed nice , too ,
until we started asking about bobby .
and what did she do ?
she locked the doors .
suddenly this guy popped up from the back
and stabbed us in the neck .
can you describe either of them ?
they were white with brown hair .
the creepy guy they gave us to had a wide face .
they &apos;re perfect .
i &apos;ll get a sketch artist .
we had a plan .
what was the plan ?
meg said kate taught her what to do .
if they try to hurt us , we buy time .
we role play , get into their heads .
when they move us , i &apos;ll distract them .
it &apos;s our best opportunity for you to run and get help .
that &apos;s right . kidnappers are most vulnerable at transfer points .
did the older man say anything about where he was taking you ?
no , he just said he had plans for us .
and then i ran . and that &apos;s when he shot the younger guy
for losing me . look , i didn &apos;t want to leave meg ,
but she said you guys would never stop looking for her .
that &apos;s what she said .
that &apos;s what she said .
ok .
did you get all that , kate ?
i told meg everything .
i told her about sadists and that the only way to undermine them
was to not show fear .
you taught her well , kate .
she can get through this .
meg callahan has been abducted
by a sophisticated sex trafficking ring .
it &apos;s a mobile operation .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s gone undetected for so long .
a broker leads the ring
with a male accomplice and a female accomplice .
they find victims and tailor their abduction plan
to each of their vulnerabilities .
and then the victims are sold , most likely online
to buyers who &apos;ve been vetted by their team .
if it &apos;s trafficking ,
couldn &apos;t the girl be on a ship
to saudi arabia by now ?
well , we &apos;re hoping they lay low
until the searchers are called off .
a male accomplice was shot dead by the broker ,
suggesting infighting and tension .
this could give us an opening .
we &apos;ll continue going door to door .
someone out there knows the leader of this ring .
don &apos;t be fooled by his facade .
he is a master manipulator .
and his female accomplice is possibly a compliant victim ,
who trauma bonded with the unsub after years in captivity .
the group &apos;s sophistication level suggests they &apos;re experienced ,
so we can expect them to employ forensic countermeasures
to hide and change the appearance of the victims
before he sells them off .
how does she look ?
great .
have you heard from kyle ?
he hasn &apos;t been answering his phone .
i told him to get rid of the body .
the body ? you killed markayla ?
oh , my god , why would you kill her ? !
quiet .
as you all know , meg is part of this family .
we do not rest until she &apos;s home safely .
thank you .
the fbi has confirmed that one of the girls taken
is in fact related to a local bau agent .
the agent , we &apos;re hearing , is a renowned profiler
who used to be with the bureau &apos;s sex crimes unit .
as the nationwide search intensifies ,
communities are asking how could this happen here ?
it &apos;s been over 3 years since a double abduction
has occurred in the area .
there have been no ransom calls at all .
we &apos;ve got flyers all the way up to massachusetts av .
i just got off the phone with garcia .
she &apos;s checked every sex trafficking website and nothing .
this is all my fault . i promised liz
that i would protect meg and look what happened .
don &apos;t do that . don &apos;t do that .
she never even told me that she liked a boy .
kate , she &apos;s 13 .
you ok ?
my stomach .
hey . listen .
your body might be done right now , but your mind &apos;s sharp .
use it . meg is depending on you .
a lot of assumptions were made with this victim , eileen banks .
badly burned , smashed car .
that &apos;s why they didn &apos;t autopsy her .
correct .
turns out , she had multiple penetrating lacerations
to her chest and neck .
they appear to be antemortem .
maybe one of the traffickers
killed her and then staged the accident .
that seems pretty elaborate .
the wounds weren &apos;t inflicted all at once .
she was stabbed over the course of several days .
sadistic traffickers .
or worse , the unsub wasn &apos;t trafficking at all .
what are you thinking ?
garcia should re @-@ evaluate
every voluntary missing person case
followed by accidental or sudden death .
this might be worse than we thought .
ok , here &apos;s my news flash .
in the tri @-@ state area , there have been
half a dozen questionable missing persons cases .
try the whole country .
all right , uh ,
california to maine ,
there have been 50 in the last 7 years .
that can &apos;t all be this unsub &apos;s group , can it ?
my thoughts , exactamundo , good sir .
ok , uh , there were two accidental deaths
that happened at the same time but 2,500 miles apart .
if they &apos;re trafficking girls ,
why would they kill them ?
all with different m.o.s. , too .
car accident , fire , shooting , drowning .
and this isn &apos;t just one group . they &apos;re different killers .
so there must be a serial abductor
and the torso killer was just one of his customers .
what the hell kind of trafficking is this ?
this isn &apos;t sex slavery .
they &apos;re selling victims to serial killers .
that &apos;s it .
stand up straight .
don &apos;t cry .
it makes your face look puffy .
help me .
look at me .
yeah , that &apos;s it .
beautiful .
the operation &apos;s actually simple .
the killers get to live out their fantasies ,
and in exchange for supplying the victims ,
the brokers make them agree to a disposal method .
this way he and his team are
insulated from the investigation .
just like in the torso case ,
the behavior and forensics of the kills
will only lead us to the customer
who actually did the killing , not the broker .
he &apos;s smart enough to protect his network
by encrypting all communication with his customers .
so if we can capture a killer while he &apos;s online ,
then garcia can hack his system and lead us right to meg .
just say the word .
garcia , the accident that killed the jogger in modesto ,
eileen banks , who hit her ?
uh , marcus townsen hit the car over the embankment .
he was admitted for minor injuries and then released .
what &apos;s his background ?
uh , searching .
holy heck , his license , registration ,
and insurance are all bogus .
well , if it was a car crash , they would have checked
his blood alcohol level at the hospital .
garcia , run the dna of that blood sample through codis .
ok , he &apos;s on a sex offender registry .
his real name is miles hendrick .
he started off stalking a neighbor &apos;s kid
and got busted in the elementary school bathroom .
now he &apos;s graduated to this . where does he live now ?
let &apos;s go . largo , maryland .
i liked your profile picture .
you look good in purple .
look , i know most men are turned off by women with kids .
i &apos;m not like that .
i had a mom who had 3 jobs
and a dad who left before i could talk .
women with children are not pariahs .
fbi !
show me your hands ! you &apos;re under arrest .
for what ?
the torture and murder of eileen banks .
you have the right to remain silent .
they just arrested miles hendrick .
they &apos;ve got his computer . we need you to break in .
what &apos;s his ip address ?
morgan just sent it to your email .
cool , i got it . ok , i am in his hard drive .
his browser history is triple encrypted . he &apos;s on tor .
ok , this is like trying to penetrate a ceramic @-@ infused
titanium wall with a butter knife . it &apos;s not happening .
we need to break miles before meg &apos;s sold off .
do you have the rest of the payment ?
she &apos;s pretty .
you &apos;ll get rid of her the same as the others ?
i &apos;m a creature of habit .
next time you should give me a discount .
i &apos;m turning into quite a good customer .
no .
no ! no .
let go of me !
help !
help !
help !
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
miles , you bought this girl off a website ,
you killed her ,
and then you made it look like a car accident .
i didn &apos;t do anything .
if you don &apos;t give us your login and password
so we can break this auction site ,
you &apos;re going down for all 50 murders .
you can &apos;t do that .
try us . the entire country &apos;s
gonna want somebody to pay for these crimes ,
and your perverted ass is perfect .
c @-@ l @-@ e @-@ v @-@ e @-@ r
b @-@ o @-@ y @-@ s .
and the passcode is ...
the passcode &apos;s 6969 .
how original .
look , i only ever ordered that one girl the one time .
it was a mistake .
i got miles &apos; password .
all right , find the website .
on it , and ...
sweet mother gross .
it &apos;s like tinder for sociopaths .
they &apos;re selling women all over the country .
do you see meg anywhere ?
wait , wait , wait . go back .
that &apos;s her . he dyed her hair .
she has been sold .
can you tell to whom ?
um ... no , &apos; cause the firewall &apos;s worse than the other one
and i &apos;m upset and i need help focusing .
what about the ip address ?
that should lead us back to the broker .
yes , yes , very good , sir . uh ... there it is .
his name &apos;s alex zorgen . he &apos;s in oakton , virginia ,
and he &apos;s on his computer right now .
fbi !
i am not playin &apos; around !
neither are we . put the gun down .
get out or i will kill her .
we &apos;re not gonna tell you again , alex .
drop your weapons or i will shoot .
that &apos;s not happening . this is over , alex .
enough ! that &apos;s enough !
you are too late . she is gone .
you tell kate megan &apos;s long gone !
get up .
i didn &apos;t know fbi chicks could be so hot .
we have an electronic trail that proves
that miles hendrick bought eileen banks from you .
where &apos;s kate ?
i want to talk to kate .
i &apos;d be much more willing to talk to kate .
and as soon as we get through
the firewalls of the other buyers ,
we &apos;ll have you for those kills , too .
where is she , alex ?
it &apos;s not too late to stop .
who did you sell meg to ?
i don &apos;t know .
you &apos;re lying , paige .
we already found 3 girls hidden in your basement .
add that to the rest of the murders ,
you &apos;re gonna be in prison till the day you die .
why are you protecting him ?
&apos;cause you know he is over there right now selling you out ,
making it seem like this was all your idea .
that &apos;s what psychopaths do , paige .
they play people .
all right , let us help you out and tell us where meg is .
she &apos;s long gone .
she could be in dubai
by now getting chopped up in a blender .
or in kansas , laying in one of my sick clients &apos; barns
saying &quot; there &apos;s no place like home . &quot;
none of that &apos;s true .
you know what &apos;s great about the internet ?
it &apos;s therapy for sick minds .
before , you thought you were alone .
but now , one click and you realize you &apos;ve got family .
come on , fellas , where &apos;s my favorite agent ?
she afraid to see me ?
it &apos;s all about the hunt for you ,
isn &apos;t it , alex ?
but you don &apos;t have the balls needed to kill ,
so you palm that off on others .
they teach you that in fbi school ?
we know exactly who and what you are .
you &apos;re a sexually diverse thrill @-@ seeker ,
always looking for a new way to get off .
and you took meg to get back at kate .
you thought we &apos;d blame their killers
and we &apos;d never know you existed .
but you didn &apos;t know that your site was vulnerable
during the auctions , did you ?
how dumb is that ?
are you dumb , alex ?
i took her because i knew i couldn &apos;t get kate .
do you have any idea how much a female fed would go for ?
well , garcia found something .
turns out paige &apos;s real name was donna mangold .
she was abducted 22 years ago .
so we were right . she &apos;s trauma bonded .
we just need to break that bond .
hey , kate , so we just found out the female partner
was abducted by alex , but she &apos;s not talking .
does she know that alex killed her partner ?
no . but we should use that .
they could have been close .
so what bond is stronger than all of this ?
mother and child .
exactly . you &apos;re gonna have
to build a rapport with paige and then use it .
that &apos;s my little girl out there .
every second she &apos;s with this sick freak ,
she &apos;s just buying time .
we &apos;re gonna find her , kate .
please don &apos;t hold back .
what happened ?
they got a lead . a real lead .
i know what you &apos;re going through , paige .
you &apos;re scared . you feel hopeless .
you don &apos;t even know who to trust .
alex took you a very long time ago .
he did horrible , horrible things to you .
he raped you , tortured you .
then all of a sudden , he &apos;d be nice .
shut up , you don &apos;t know him .
your life was literally dependent on him .
so you eventually did whatever he asked you to do .
cleaned , cooked , helped with his abductions .
in your mind , your past life was lost .
but you had the one person you loved most with you .
no ...
kyle .
we checked hospital and dental records
and couldn &apos;t find any info . kyle was your son .
he was our son .
how could a father kill his own child ?
how could he-- how could he do that to a mother ?
i don &apos;t understand .
parents that kill their children are monsters .
now , you were under duress when you helped him .
but my friend &apos;s daughter is gonna die
if you don &apos;t help us right now .
who bought meg , paige ?
where is she ?
he &apos;s one of alex &apos;s best clients .
he does ... unspeakable things .
and then he spreads the body parts in the potomac .
where does he live ?
i don &apos;t know .
but you can reach him online .
you know , when i was little , i hated my dolls .
that &apos;s when i started breaking them .
i &apos;d break their legs off ,
their arms ,
save their heads for last .
no one understood why i did it .
but i liked it .
i liked the feeling .
you understand , don &apos;t you ?
this is what i &apos;m planning .
i don &apos;t want you to do it fast .
that &apos;s how i did it when i used to cut myself .
shut up !
i &apos;m not gonna tell you again .
how many dolls were there before me ?
stop !
am i your first doll ?
keep quiet . you &apos;re ruining it .
i want you to do it slow .
no ! no !
they &apos;re gonna get you !
you little bitch .
no !
you can &apos;t break me !
help ! somebody ! help !
help !
help !
help !
get me down ! get me down !
get me down .
i got you . i got you .
you &apos;re ok .
i did what kate said .
ok .
are you ok ?
ok , ok .
i did what kate said .
ok .
michael rigby .
kevin hawkins .
oh , god , meg .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i should have known .
shh . it &apos;s not your fault .
it &apos;s not your fault .
thank you .
not you , too .
am i getting another godson ?
possibly .
maybe a goddaughter .
hey . am i interrupting something ?
no , not at all .
i &apos;m just finishing some paperwork . come on in .
i was in the neighborhood .
how are you feeling ?
oh , better . the doctor assures me
that we &apos;re both gonna be fine .
good . and how &apos;s meg holding up ?
she &apos;s doing pretty good . we found a great therapist ,
so we &apos;ll go when she &apos;s ready .
good .
look , i wanted to apologize .
you told me to let the torso case go ,
and i should have listened .
well , we both had a feeling .
not the point .
well , in the end you were right .
and think of all the girls who were saved .
yeah . a website for serial killers .
who knew ?
you know , a few weeks before my sister died ,
we went to virginia beach for her birthday ,
just the two of us ,
and we were laying there
and i asked her what she was thinking .
and she said , you know , kate ,
if anything ever happens to me or joe ,
just promise me that you &apos;ll take care of my little girl .
and , i mean , of course i said i would .
you know ? nothing was going to happen to her .
she was 24 .
and ... just like that , it did .
you &apos;re a great mom .
yeah , i took a year off when i got meg ,
and it was ...
the best year of my life .
and so ,
i think i want to do that for this one , too .
you &apos;ll always have a place here .
thank you .
let me know if you need anything .
&quot; life is about choices .
some we regret . some we &apos;re proud of .
we are what we choose to be . &quot;
