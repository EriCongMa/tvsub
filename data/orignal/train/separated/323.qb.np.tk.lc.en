here you go .
and i hope you enjoyed dinner and the show .
the show being me pretending i &apos;m happy as a waitress .
caroline , where is max ?
and i &apos;ve already checked the bowels of hell .
yeah , i know where i work .
max is going to be late today
&apos;cause she got stuck on the subway .
but you said yesterday she was late
because she was stuck on the subway .
no , i believe i said yesterday she got stuck under the subway .
oleg , a little help .
oh , max ?
today she got stuck on a bus .
and you said that the day before yesterday .
earl ?
she got stuck between the moon and new york city .
i know it &apos;s crazy , but it &apos;s true .
sorry i &apos;m late .
i couldn &apos;t find our cat , nancy .
also , i was stuck on the bus or under the subway .
unless they told you something different ,
then i was doing that .
oh , come on . that excuse was less satisfying
than the end of serial .
讲述一起杀人案件 非常热门火爆
max , really , what do you take me for ?
well , i know where i can &apos;t take you .
on the big rides at disneyland .
nancy still hasn &apos;t come home .
i &apos;m freaking out .
she &apos;s the only thing i love .
whatever .
i had a cat once . he was cool .
he was black and very sexually active .
oh , wait , the cool cat i &apos;m talking about was me .
earl , be careful , at your age , you could die having sex .
i know .
those ladies don &apos;t know whether i &apos;m coming or going .
i think nancy might be gone for good .
i just can &apos;t believe she didn &apos;t take me with her .
we had a deal .
max , she &apos;ll come back to the apartment ,
even if she doesn &apos;t want to .
i mean , i always do .
i am not surprised you &apos;re not worried .
you never really liked nancy .
you call her &quot; that cat . &quot;
as in , &quot; that cat &quot; peed on my pillow .
while i was sleeping on it , max .
well , blame me . i got her drunk .
hey , everybody !
look , girls , i got your pussy in my purse .
either that &apos;s a cat ,
or you two got to keep better track of your belongings .
yay !
that cat &apos;s back .
see , max ?
i am excited .
oh , i missed you so much .
oh , yes , i did .
that &apos;s not nancy .
that is a boy .
well , max , sorry i don &apos;t check out a cat &apos;s junk
the second it comes through the door .
yeah , you only look at the face .
that &apos;s the difference between you and me .
see , look , the name tag says &quot; cinnamon . &quot;
no wonder that little girl kept crying and saying ,
&quot; give me cinnamon , give me cinnamon . &quot;
i looked her right in the eye and i said ,
&quot; i don &apos;t carry spices in my purse . &quot;
max , you are completely overreacting .
it &apos;s just a--
oh ! just a what ?
say it !
it &apos;s just a cat .
you !
hey , i &apos;m the one who fronted us that dollar to get her name tag .
thanks to me , someone &apos;s gonna pick her up ,
look at it , and say , &quot; oh , you must be lost ,
little ... cat . &quot;
nancy ! her name &apos;s nancy !
i know her name !
it got momentarily pushed out of my head
to make room for those 1,600 cupcake t @-@ shirts
we can &apos;t unload or pay for .
you think i don &apos;t wake up screaming
four or five nights a week about those t @-@ shirts ?
but i know our cat &apos;s name .
you don &apos;t wake up at night ever .
no , i sleep like a dead baby , it &apos;s my one gift .
oh , the phone !
unknown number . this could be it !
i like my numbers like my condom expiration dates , unknown .
hello ?
yes ?
who is it , max ?
you have her ? yay !
oh , sure , great . thank you .
he has her ? he has nancy ?
please , too little , too late .
max , we &apos;re in $ 10,000 worth of debt
and you spent money on new kitty litter ?
relax , i &apos;m going to pee in it , too .
well , i guess it beats that sprite bottle
you &apos;ve been using in your bedroom .
it &apos;s just such a long walk to the bathroom
that every time i have to go ,
it &apos;s like i &apos;m raising money for ms.
协调困难 认知障碍 平衡障碍等等
oh , i have good news .
i found your lost bra in the litter box .
don &apos;t think i &apos;m not still wearing it .
i mean , why not ?
i ate a hot dog that rolled under a car the other day .
i left a couple of big clumps in ,
just to help you out a little .
oh , okay , that &apos;s nancy .
here &apos;s a chance for a fresh start for you two .
and don &apos;t bring up the bra , we don &apos;t know why she wanted it ,
but i &apos;m sure she had her reasons .
fine , i &apos;ll be on my best behavior .
but you watch and see how she treats me .
it &apos;s a two @-@ way street .
hi , i have your cat .
and surprisingly , your doorknob .
oh , that gum wore out already ?
hi , buddy !
hi , i &apos;m caroline . this is max .
thank you so much for bringing back--
nancy ! - i know !
and please note , she did not even look at me .
hi . i &apos;m owen .
well , we are &quot; owen &quot; you a big thank @-@ you .
kind of low on cash , how would you feel
about 1,000 cute cupcake tees ?
yeah , i don &apos;t need 1,000 pink t @-@ shirts .
my dad &apos;s already mad at me i don &apos;t care about sports .
how do you get this thing open ?
we usually just take nancy around
in an old vacuum cleaner bag .
also doubles as my &quot; going out &quot; purse .
pardon me , may i get past ?
oh , manners .
in our doorway ?
i don &apos;t know what to do .
what &apos;s next , a front stoop with no discarded heroin needles ?
yeah , i just came up there .
not today .
here , let me help .
i mean , i &apos;m the dumb one who paid $ 2,000 for a cat carrier .
hmm . i miss being that stupid .
you know , my cat can &apos;t get this open either .
it must be the lack of thumbs .
rich , funny , and in a suit at 9 : 00 a.m. ?
i really don &apos;t know what to do .
you know , my cat , dickens , loves your cat .
oh , dickens , after the author ?
dickens , after the author , max .
yeah , i know who that is .
the guy who wrote muppets christmas carol .
there . i knew i &apos;d get it .
&apos;cause i have thumbs .
oh , there she is .
so i take it by the cat , you &apos;re single ?
big time .
so , do you and dickens live alone ?
oh no , she &apos;s trying to flirt .
i travel a lot for work .
i &apos;m a venture capitalist .
so you know how it is .
oh , i do . i absolutely do .
i ...
here it comes .
went to wharton .
boom .
well , if she gets lost again , you know where to find her .
she &apos;s been hanging around outside our window
every day for the last couple of months .
so i let her in . i hope that &apos;s okay .
is that okay ? it &apos;s awesome .
i hope your girlfriend didn &apos;t mind .
we just broke up .
so i &apos;m single .
and i better get going .
i &apos;ve got a 10 : 00 meeting .
max , give the man his case .
he has a 10 : 00 meeting .
she doesn &apos;t want to get out of cushy this thing .
i totally get it .
i had to be dragged out of that massage chair
at brookstone by mall security .
well , here &apos;s my card , just give me a call
when you want me to pick up the case .
you have a card ?
a card , a meeting , a suit , a joke ?
are you the next bachelor ?
well , thank you , owen charles boyd ,
for bringing back our beloved--
her name &apos;s nancy !
i know her name .
why do i have to say it so fast ?
she &apos;s joking , she &apos;s just not as funny as you .
well , it was nice to meet you .
bye , nancy .
okay .
yes , i was flirting .
but i was doing it for our business .
you should really be doing it for your business .
&apos;cause your business is going out of business .
he has a card .
and it &apos;s not for medical marijuana .
he &apos;s a venture capitalist .
that &apos;s the kind of fat cat
that can help us get back on our feet .
speaking of fat cats , nancy &apos;s looking like
she might need to give jenny a call .
hey , girls .
oh , you found nancy .
i knew she &apos;d come back pregnant .
wait , sophie , how can you tell she &apos;s pregnant
and just not fighting the same battle jonah hill is fighting ?
well , her fur is thicker , she &apos;s got a little sparkle in her eye ,
and there &apos;s a little kitten head about to pop out of her patoot .
come on . push , nancy .
come on , we all know what you did .
now is not the time to be shy .
you do know what you &apos;re doing , right , sophie ?
this isn &apos;t like the time you told us
you could do your own bikini wax with a candle ?
&apos;cause i still have the vanilla @-@ scented scars from that .
don &apos;t worry .
in my village , all the kuchenskis women
acted as animal midwives .
it was the best way to meet guys .
strap in , girls .
she &apos;s crowning !
i can &apos;t believe it .
i thought nancy was smarter than this .
but it turns out she &apos;s just like the rest of the women
in my family .
screwed by some stranger she met in the dumpster .
okay , here we go .
oh , there goes my ring .
i--sorry , nancy .
oh , here we go !
come on , girls , i need some hot water and fresh towels .
we do , too . for , like , four years .
how about some of these t @-@ shirts ?
oh , sure why not use those ?
they used to be our bright future .
now just a shamwow for illegitimate cats .
oh , my god , that must be the sound of a surrendering cat uterus .
well , it &apos;s the first time a uterus has surrendered
in that bed in a while .
i don &apos;t know why i &apos;m not throwing up .
oh , wait . i &apos;m starting to .
well , i &apos;m off korean dumplings for life .
this one-- this one won &apos;t come out .
it &apos;s like the queen latifah of kittens .
可是一直以来一直没有出柜
sophie , i got your text that you were in bed with nancy .
who is this nancy ,
and when did we go back to doing three @-@ ways ?
nancy &apos;s a cat .
mm , that &apos;s a no .
i &apos;ve got to draw the line somewhere .
well , i heard the news .
looks like you two are grandmothers before you &apos;re 30 .
can &apos;t say i &apos;m surprised .
okay , before you even ask ,
i don &apos;t pay for cat maternity leave .
this isn &apos;t google .
this isn &apos;t even ask jeeves , han .
现重整旗鼓后改名为ask.com
well , i can help you get the kittens good homes .
the people in my building are very nice .
except if you don &apos;t recycle one bottle of sparkling cider ,
then nobody talks to you in the elevator .
han , we &apos;re not giving the kittens away .
nancy landed herself a rich cat ,
we &apos;re gonna be living off a hefty kitty support .
only you two would be desperate enough
to try and find a sugar catty .
so has owen called you back yet ?
um , we &apos;re trading .
&quot; we &apos;re trading &quot; ?
&quot; we &apos;re trading &quot; is lonely white girl talk
for &quot; he hasn &apos;t called me back . &quot;
i can &apos;t believe this . he &apos;s a deadbeat dad .
max , he &apos;s just busy .
and i think you might be projecting a little because of your dad .
not that i &apos;m a therapist .
i mean , i can &apos;t even afford a couch .
i &apos;m not projecting .
i just know a deadbeat dad when i don &apos;t see one !
where &apos;s his card ?
i don &apos;t remember where i--
max , let go ! i &apos;ve got this .
that guy can really help us with our business .
please , let me handle this .
look , ryan gosling .
i got this .
i got this .
i got this .
i got this .
keep going , girls , i &apos;m almost there .
i got this , max .
and when he comes to get the cat carrier ,
i &apos;ll talk to him .
you &apos;re way too emotional .
you just went to third base with my apron .
sitting on this stoop is nice .
how come we never sit out here ?
there it is .
oh , please , it &apos;s just rico .
rico looks good . i think he got another tattoo .
look , when owen gets here , should we still be alive ,
please let me do the talking .
kittens aside , owen can help us .
a venture capitalist buys companies
and turns them around .
yeah , i &apos;ve seen pretty woman .
that &apos;s how i realized i wasn &apos;t charging enough .
go , max , here he comes .
all right , but i &apos;ll be watching inside from the window .
it &apos;s probably better ,
because i don &apos;t trust nancy alone with those kittens .
she &apos;s got some serious postpartum .
when i left the room , she was lighting a menthol 100
with a shaky paw .
hi .
crazy we live walking distance from each other .
we don &apos;t .
the uber driver wouldn &apos;t go past the fire hydrant on the corner .
the one with the bloody shoe hanging from it ?
that &apos;s the one .
you know what ? i &apos;m just gonna take the cat carrier .
before you go ...
we have this small cupcake company
that &apos;s just begging to be an empire ,
and i wanted to pick your brain about some business stuff .
okay , so your dickens got our cat pregnant ,
and she just had five kittens .
and at her age , it &apos;s a miracle we didn &apos;t have to pay for in vitro .
how do you know they are dickens &apos;s ?
i &apos;m not saying that nancy &apos;s easy ,
it &apos;s just , i &apos;ve seen her go in and out of a lot of windows .
did he just drop a gun ?
it &apos;s fine . he has more .
okay , call my assistant , you can pick my brain .
i just don &apos;t want it to be off the sidewalk .
really , i got to go . i can &apos;t get killed .
i &apos;m wearing new suede loafers .
uber , an assistant , and suede loafers ?
are you for real ?
i hope i &apos;m not intruding .
no , come in .
i was just brushing my new loafers .
i bought them as a break @-@ up gift for myself .
but unlike my ex @-@ girlfriend , these have a sole .
i didn &apos;t wanna mention the cat situation to your assistant .
next thing you know , it &apos;s all over the lunch room :
owen charles boyd &apos;s cat is a raw @-@ dogger .
my business partner stepped on them .
said it was an accident .
didn &apos;t feel like one .
one shoe yes , but both ?
highly unlikely .
owen , sometimes in life ,
it &apos;s not just an innocent cat that gets screwed .
a girl can get screwed as well .
oh , hey , hi . what &apos;s happening ?
as in , screwed by one bad business decision .
my partner , max , and i recently invested all our savings in--
well , here , take a look .
oh , my coffee !
my loafer !
my coffee &apos;s on my loafer !
here , let me .
no , you dab . you don &apos;t wipe suede .
you dab .
dab . dab . i &apos;m sorry .
i used to know that .
that &apos;s rich 101 .
let me just go find some water
and i &apos;ll dab , not wipe , this out .
we &apos;re not done yet . i &apos;m going back in .
it &apos;s going really well though .
where &apos;s water ?
do you know how to unsend an email ?
if i did , my rich ex @-@ boyfriend would &apos;ve never found out
what i thought of his lisp
and i &apos;d be living in the &quot; thouth of franth &quot; right now .
where is he ?
he needs to see these adorable bastards .
max , how did you find me here ?
i told you i was going on a &quot; think walk . &quot;
i followed you .
i never noticed how much you check yourself out in store windows .
you have a problem .
do either of you know a way to turn the phrase ,
&quot; self @-@ absorbed , ridiculous pig &quot; into a compliment ?
if i did , i &apos;d still be on the apprentice .
owen &apos;s going to see that email
and i &apos;m going to get fired .
i have to start paying attention to details .
i &apos;m just gonna go back in .
what ? i don &apos;t care .
not without me you &apos;re not .
max , please , let me handle this .
i &apos;m begging you .
we &apos;re getting close , look , i &apos;m holding his shoe .
if he doesn &apos;t step up here ,
these kittens will feel neglected ,
and it is only a matter of time till they are waitressing or worse .
max , you &apos;re wrong .
there &apos;s nothing worse than waitressing .
max , stop !
you &apos;ll ruin everything .
i can fix this and us .
we are beyond help .
it &apos;s all about these kittens .
now move , i got this .
no , i got this .
i got this .
i got this .
i--
oh , my god .
what the hell is happening ?
that &apos;s right . i came to your office with a basket of cats .
max , i &apos;m so sorry .
yeah , well , he &apos;s the one who should be sorry .
i want you to look these kittens in the whiskers
and tell them that dickens is not their father .
what makes you think they &apos;re mine . why ?
because they look just like dickens
when he was a tiny baby kitten .
oh , and this one &apos;s even cuter .
and that one .
i &apos;ll take them all .
but not that one . seems a little off .
not quite as alert as the others .
oh , she &apos;s not good enough for you ?
max . projecting .
i &apos;m not projecting .
he said she &apos;s not good enough for him .
what ?
just because she was unplanned and not good at math ?
developed boobs way too early ?
okay , fine . i &apos;m projecting .
what is going on ?
caroline , are we gonna hook up or what ?
this is , like the weirdest foreplay ever .
hook up ? what would make you think i want to hook up ?
oh , because i business flirted ?
that &apos;s wharton 101 .
it was more than business flirting .
you begged to come to my office ,
show up wearing a see @-@ through shirt .
that was not by choice .
it is cheaply made .
i came here to talk to you about our business ,
and possibly get you to invest in a small , but spirited--
invest ? this is the financial capital of the world .
yes , it is .
why would i invest in a desperate little cupcake shop ?
you !
that &apos;s it !
no cats for you .
you know what ?
you are a self @-@ absorbed , ridiculous pig .
says you .
and your assistant .
check your email .
i was able to unsend it .
yeah , might want to re @-@ ignite that linkedin profile .
you &apos;re gonna be home a lot more , you want a cat ?
thanks for taking the kittens , han .
i feel like you have an understanding
of small creatures , being one yourself .
have no fear , my building is loaded with lesbians .
they take home rescue cats
faster than they take home other lesbians .
okay , let &apos;s discuss my terms .
unlike all my non @-@ animal children ,
i want to know they &apos;re taken care of .
what part of lesbian don &apos;t you understand ?
they &apos;ll be swaddled in a flannel shirt by nightfall .
okay , now this one , i call junkie .
&apos;cause he &apos;s got a serious catnip problem .
oh , so you raised a drug addict within a week .
sounds about right .
these two should try and stay together .
we call them game of thrones one
and game of thrones two .
&apos;cause they &apos;re siblings and lovers .
this one &apos;s the boy .
watch him and learn what humping looks like .
this one &apos;s pretty bland .
she lays around , doesn &apos;t meow much ,
and when she does , she &apos;s kind of phoning it in .
we call her amy adams .
yep .
this last one gets special attention .
she &apos;s the smallest , but she &apos;s got potential .
i mean , look at those nipples .
and now the nipples are all i see .
have a nice life .
i &apos;ll find you on instagram .
check out grumpy cat .
do what he does .
well , bye , kitties .
and remember , stripping isn &apos;t dancing .
and now all i can see is them wearing pasties .
you know what , max ?
we don &apos;t need that rich guy to fix our business .
we can do it ourselves .
who am i kidding ? our business is in worse shape
than two retired guys in a golf cart .
well , you know what we &apos;d better fix ?
nancy .
&apos;cause he was right , she &apos;s a slut .
someone just found her 69 @-@ ing a tabby in the alley .
