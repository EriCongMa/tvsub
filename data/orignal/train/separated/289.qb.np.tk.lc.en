what &apos;s up , peanut ?
max , i &apos;m not paying you to just stand there .
well , you &apos;re not paying me to eat as many french fries
as i can before the plate leaves the kitchen ,
but i do that too .
go wait on that pretty girl .
oh , wait . is she a boy ?
she looks a little like a pretty boy .
she &apos;s probably looking at you and thinking the same thing .
but are you attracted to the girl she is
or the boy she appears to be ?
you &apos;re confused , aren &apos;t you , han ?
yes , my mind tells me one thing ,
but my body tells me something else .
max , go on break . i &apos;ve got the booth .
oh , no . you can &apos;t wait on her .
that &apos;s tina , a lesbian who turns straight girls .
i call her &quot; tina the turner . &quot;
practically every heterosexual woman
in williamsburg has hooked up with her .
max , everyone ?
not me . who do you think turned her ?
but you won &apos;t be able to resist her charm . trust me .
that &apos;s nonsense . i &apos;m very comfortable with my sexuality .
i once texted &quot; yes &quot; to mr. chaz bono
on dancing with the stars .
okay , good luck .
just don &apos;t let me catch you guys making out on the table .
or do . it &apos;s a free country .
hi , are you ready to order ?
sure . i love your hair , by the way .
earl , caroline &apos;s about to fall in love with a lesbian .
well , color me &quot; i saw that one coming . &quot;
how &apos;d it go ?
fine , she complimented my hair ,
she ordered a soup , i gave her my number .
i gave her my number ?
okay , hit the showers .
that &apos;s what i get for sending a straight woman
to do an emotionally dead woman &apos;s job .
it was so nice to wake up this morning
without the stress of owning our cupcake business .
the only decision i have to make today is :
do i change my underwear
or just turn these inside out ?
four years ago , i was hit with a similar conundrum :
&quot; do i buy underwear or do i buy beer ? &quot;
i &apos;ve been free @-@ balling it ever since .
max , what are you doing ? what &apos;s happening over there ?
oh , you mean the arrow from the shop ?
i put it on so you &apos;d know
where the insults were coming from .
i &apos;m talking about the cupcakes .
our cupcake shop is gone .
why are you still making those things ?
it &apos;s the only constant in my life ,
and the routine distracts me from the relentless darkness
that lurks in every corner of my thoughts .
besides , we still need to sell these at the diner
to make extra money .
well , you can do it . i &apos;m not speaking to them .
they totally led me on .
those cupcakes were a tease .
well , i want to pay rent this month .
and then again next month , and so on and so on
until the exquisite release of death .
oh , rent . here we go again .
does that bitch ever stop ?
if that &apos;s death , it &apos;s for me .
tell him to honk and i &apos;ll be right out .
morning , chestnut .
oh , what is it about those big , beautiful eyes
that makes everything feel better .
i guess i just have a warmth .
oh , you mean the horse .
is this still good ?
it is not .
eh , like i have a choice .
wow , that was a blast from the past-
my old temp agency .
flu &apos;s got their staff laid up . they need bodies .
wanna do it ? i bet they &apos;ll let us temp together .
you think ? you think they &apos;d let us temp together ?
oh , god . last week ,
i owned a cupcake business , now i &apos;m temping .
why don &apos;t i just ask chestnut to kick me in the head ?
he won &apos;t do it . i &apos;ve asked him like seven times .
look , we &apos;ve both casually fantasized about our deaths
within ten minutes of waking up ,
so maybe we should do something to distract us .
and xeroxing will make us feel whole ?
let me tell you something .
when you &apos;re photocopying your ass on a xerox machine ,
you are never more alive .
hello , old friend .
here it is , my temping blazer .
ahh , you can still smell the &quot; no way out . &quot;
why is that in a bucket ?
&apos;cause i don &apos;t want to accidentally wear it .
well , is there a pantsuit in the oven i could wear ?
it doesn &apos;t matter what you wear--you &apos;re a temp .
they &apos;ll be impressed if you don &apos;t poop your pants .
and even if you do , not a deal breaker .
all right , i &apos;ll go ,
but if we &apos;re temping to make our rent ,
that &apos;s the last batch of those .
i don &apos;t want to see , hear , or think
any more about cupcakes .
ding dong , the cupcake &apos;s calling .
we found the cupcake costumes from your store
out near the dumpster .
are you guys drunk ?
yes !
yeah , we &apos;ve been out clubbing all night .
oh , i just swallowed one of my balls .
yeah . yeah .
well , now , you know how i feel .
i threw those costumes away on purpose .
max and i are no longer making cupcakes .
what &apos;d you say ?
cupcakes are a waste of time and money .
you take that back right now !
no , you don &apos;t-
you &apos;re lucky
that i have a giant cake holding me back right now .
fifth floor , end of dreams .
oh , yeah , i worked here before .
you know the toaster oven in our kitchen ?
it came from here .
hi . caroline channing , reporting for my first day .
i went ahead and printed out my address ,
social security number , and other important information
to make your life easier .
hey , i &apos;m temp number two . where your bathroom at ?
i &apos;ll get eli . he &apos;s my boss .
sign these stating that if you &apos;re injured on the job ,
it &apos;s not our fault .
how would we injure ourselves in an office ?
let me just give you a &quot; for instance . &quot;
some girl , let &apos;s say her name is sarah ,
is walking through the office
with her number 2 pencil facing up @-@ ways .
well , she trips over her shoes and falls ,
and that number 2 pencil goes right through her eyeball
and into her brain .
and now she &apos;s gotta eat applesauce through a straw
the rest of her life .
see , that &apos;s not our fault , that &apos;s her fault ,
as per the judge &apos;s decision
in sarah drake vs. westship insurance .
sign those . i &apos;ll get eli .
thank you . i &apos;m sorry , i didn &apos;t get your name .
that &apos;s &apos; cause i didn &apos;t give it to you .
what are you doing ?
you never give anybody your real name .
that way , when you make your little data entry mistake ,
they can &apos;t track the real you down .
you didn &apos;t see me at the enron trial , did you ?
后来被爆出财产造价丑闻 遭受法庭审判
and that light in your eyes ? dim it down , way down .
show me .
that &apos;s actually really good . how &apos;d you do that ?
i thought about our future .
great !
eli &apos;s in a meeting ,
but you gotta watch this sexual harassment video .
watching a video seems like a waste of time
when we could be doing something more productive .
a waste of time ? let me just give you a &quot; for instance . &quot;
there &apos;s this dominican guy ,
he &apos;s installing a new water jug in the office ,
and he looks at one of the female employees and says ,
&quot; speaking of jugs , &quot; and then he reaches up
and cups the employee &apos;s breastesses
then starts twisting on the nips and what have you .
now , how do you handle a situation like that ?
that &apos;s actually how my longest relationship started .
i &apos;d love to give you that promotion , beverly ,
but first , you &apos;ll have to do something ... for me .
don &apos;t do it , beverly ! don &apos;t do it !
spoiler alert . i &apos;ve watched this in here before ,
and it does not end well for beverly .
well , not to blame the victim ,
but who wears a black bra to work ?
these shelves would be so much better
if they were alphabetized and color @-@ coordinated .
forget that cabinet and look at the top shelf on beverly .
i &apos;m a little jelly .
that &apos;s right , beverly .
now , bend down and pick up that file .
oh , doug , you &apos;re up to your old tricks ,
and she falls for it every time .
let &apos;s pause here and write down these rules
we &apos;ve learned from beverly and doug .
oh , i love the smell in here .
reminds me of interning on wall street ,
you know , minus the dignity and the future .
but why would the paper products be near the toner cartridges ?
whoever organized this place
must have been stupid or lazy or both .
a @-@ both .
forget all that shelf stuff .
you are not here to improve office layout ,
you &apos;re here to keep quiet , pretend like you &apos;re working ,
and steal five to ten vitamin waters
from the break room at the end of each day .
are you watching dirty videos in here and didn &apos;t invite me ?
they &apos;re making harassment videos in 3 @-@ d now ?
i was looking for the new temps ,
but i think i wandered into a beauty pageant .
uh , the votes are in . it &apos;s a tie .
i &apos;m eli green , the office manager .
you must be our new temps .
i &apos;m caroline channing .
and i &apos;m carmen ... sandiego .
no relation .
oh , my god , this is great !
the cat &apos;s eating the dog &apos;s food .
the dog &apos;s just like , &quot; wha @-@ a @-@ at ? &quot;
yo , psst . &quot; cat eats dog food . &quot;
youtube it now .
kinda busy with my work .
it &apos;s called &quot; minimum wage &quot;
&apos;cause you &apos;re supposed to do the minimum .
coffee tastes so much better
when it &apos;s from today and you haven &apos;t paid for it .
the dog &apos;s just like , &quot; wha @-@ a @-@ at &quot; &quot;
classic .
you like that video ? look up &quot; cat vs. toddler . &quot;
you &apos;re welcome .
is this a modeling agency ?
did i get off on the wrong floor ?
i don &apos;t care where you get off as long as it &apos;s not here .
hi , eli . so any idea when they &apos;ll decide
who &apos;s getting the junior executive promotion , or-
not yet , but i did just mention your name
to the big guys , ryan .
i &apos;m leon .
hey , caroline .
hi . question :
i already finished the first quarter claim reports ...
are you doping ? we need to stretch this out .
and since i had time , i took the liberty
of reformatting the expense template ,
so what would you like me to do now , eli ?
say my name , say my name .
hey , caroline , you &apos;re not just hot ,
you &apos;re on fire over there .
you should be throwing your hat
in the ring for that executive job .
really ?
and this girl &apos;s just like , &quot; wha @-@ a @-@ at ? &quot;
that temp place is soul @-@ sucking ,
and i didn &apos;t even know i had a soul to suck .
if that &apos;s a suicide note , just add my name to the end .
come on , it &apos;s not that bad ,
and i got four free fresh coffee drinks ,
and one had a caramel drizzle .
caramel drizzle ?
that &apos;s definitely my name at my next temp job .
i don &apos;t know if this is such a temp job .
i &apos;m filling out this application
to apply for that junior executive position .
oh , no , you &apos;re not .
we &apos;re only going back one more time
to get enough wite @-@ out
to do the kim kardashian white manicure .
max , you saw me there today .
i &apos;m good at this ,
and it felt amazing to be working somewhere
where my skills are valued and supported .
are you not feeling supported here ?
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m a boss , not a bra .
should i praise you more ?
really killing it
with the leaning on the counter doing nothing .
kudos , caroline . huzzah .
hey , where &apos;s my &quot; huzzah &quot; ?
i was standing around doing nothing too .
and don &apos;t forget about me .
i was sitting around doing nothing .
in korea , you all would be left on the curb
and taken away with the garbage .
is that how you got to america , han ?
earl , caroline &apos;s being an idiot .
oh , are we doing this in front of her now ?
hey , would you still apply for that job
if i told you we sold out of the cupcakes tonight ?
last one .
oh , so what , they &apos;re good one day
and you want me to take them back ?
who am i , robert pattinson ?
两人经历了一连串的偷腥分手复合的情感闹剧
so you just cut lil &apos; coconut here out of your life ?
that &apos;s cold .
max , this job offers medical benefits .
there are doctors who don &apos;t have medical benefits .
and financial security .
maybe i want to wake up every morning
not wanting to kill myself .
well , that &apos;s weird , but whatever .
i went to wharton .
pay attention , everyone .
i know you &apos;re all very busy working hard-
congratulations ,
you &apos;ve just won a free ipad .
attention , everyone !
while doing work and nothing but work ,
i may have downloaded a virus that meows ,
so be on the lookout .
carry on , eli .
thank you , carmen .
happy to say , tenth floor
has finally picked our new junior exec ,
and that person is sitting right here .
yes !
no , caroline .
yes !
no !
champagne on me !
yes !
here , i got us a fresh bottle ,
&apos;cause i &apos;m the boss .
miss black , would you pop that cork for me ?
i &apos;d be happy to , miss channing , you bitch .
okay .
okay , okay ,
now i &apos;m gonna make a proper toast .
i don &apos;t know how .
their toaster oven &apos;s in our kitchen .
to max--i promise not to sexually harass you
no matter how much i &apos;m required to as your superior .
to caroline- i cannot promise the same thing ,
&apos;cause sister , you fine .
oh , crap ! i spilled champagne on my good bucket blazer .
yes , right there on your breasts , beverly .
i &apos;m doing doug from the sexual harassment video .
the doug ? love your harassment work !
especially that sad h.r. scene
where you get fired and cry
but still manage to touch yourself a little .
wow , beverly ,
your breasts are so big , i might need the whole box .
that &apos;s enough . you &apos;re making this rag feel even dirtier .
hey , hand me that .
what ?
my new westship company poncho ?
yep .
now it &apos;s my booze bib .
oh , i love this .
somehow it &apos;s small enough to fit in your purse ,
but large enough to sleep under
during an &quot; occupy wall street &quot; -type situation .
max , i &apos;m pouring you more champagne
because i have something
really exciting i want to tell you .
i talked to eli about hiring you full @-@ time .
you are now a junior executive &apos;s executive assistant !
i will knock you to the ground !
max , think about it .
it comes with health care .
you wouldn &apos;t have to decide
between birth control pills and morning @-@ after pills .
are you trying to take away a woman &apos;s right to choose ?
come on , it could be so fun .
coming to work together , getting free coffee-
the good kind , the blended kind-
not to mention xeroxing our asses
and feeling more alive than ever .
watch , i &apos;ll show you what a fun boss i can be .
let &apos;s xerox our asses .
well , how could i say no to copying my butt ?
the only thing better than one of my butts
is two of my butts .
i &apos;ll go first .
too late !
do you want legal size paper or three @-@ hole punch ?
three @-@ hole punch ?
that &apos;s how my longest relationship ended .
ready , you corporate sell @-@ out . fry me .
hey , why is it still flashing ?
i put in 100 copies instead of one .
don &apos;t worry about it , we &apos;ll use them as christmas cards .
see ? that &apos;s why i need an assistant .
thanks , but i &apos;m not gonna take this stupid corporate job .
i &apos;m gonna stick with cupcakes , even though you just quit .
i didn &apos;t quit the cupcake business .
if you remember , it quit us .
at least this job makes sense .
you get a regular paycheck , benefits .
you don &apos;t spend two whole years of your life
giving it everything ,
and then walk away feeling like a failure .
get off that now .
i &apos;m worried you &apos;re giving yourself butt cancer .
wait , you think you &apos;re a failure ?
&apos;cause i think we did amazing .
the shop closed , max .
our dream blew up in our face .
lots of things blow up in your face .
it &apos;s part of being a woman .
you just ... towel off and keep going .
you &apos;re really going to do this ?
this was just supposed to be a temporary distraction
till we got back to the cupcake thing .
no , max . cupcakes were the temp job .
no , cupcakes were our dream .
well , i was wrong .
maybe it &apos;s better not to have a dream .
good morning , everyone .
eli , they said you wanted to see me in here ?
ms. channing , my name is michelle yi , i &apos;m with h.r.
aw ! is this my official welcome ?
oh , hello .
well , here , i brought some
first @-@ day bagels and plain cream cheese .
sometimes chives can be a little breathy , am i right ?
is this the woman who sexually harassed you ?
yup , that &apos;s her .
oh , good one ! really funny .
me harassing you ?
come on , you &apos;re not even my type .
caroline , this isn &apos;t a joke .
trust me , i &apos;ve been through four of these .
wait , what &apos;s going on ?
ms. channing , please don &apos;t address carmen directly .
max .
&quot; max &quot; ?
is that a pet name she has for you , carmen ?
yes . she also calls me &quot; caramel drizzle . &quot;
can you tell me what exactly happened
with ms . channing last night ?
she fondled my breasts .
ms. yi , it &apos;s not how it sounds .
we were drinking , and i was pretending to be a man .
&quot; drinking . &quot; &quot; pretending to be a man . &quot;
don &apos;t write that down . don &apos;t write that down .
and carmen , when ms. channing touched you ,
how did that make you feel ?
dirty .
dirty and underpaid .
she felt dirty ?
come on , ms. yi , you don &apos;t know her .
she &apos;s the dirty girl .
she is a dirty , dirty girl .
and does that turn you on ?
no ! it &apos;s almost impossible to turn me on .
oh , good . now i don &apos;t feel so bad .
trust me , she &apos;s making this stuff up .
i &apos;m sorry , ms. channing .
we &apos;re gonna have to terminate your employment .
this is outrageous !
nothing she said ever happened .
then how do you explain this ?
that is a copy from a xerox machine
badly in need of toner ,
which is just one of the many oversights
that would not have continued
had i been made an executive here .
good day .
i don &apos;t know what she &apos;s talking about .
that butt couldn &apos;t be any toner .
write that down , write that down .
can i get a peek at that ?
how are you tonight , caroline ?
angry , frustrated , humiliated .
just another tuesday at the diner .
hello , carmen .
or is it &quot; caramel drizzle ? &quot;
just so you know ,
that stunt will go on my professional work record .
oh , please .
this diner &apos;s on your professional work record .
and your record &apos;s clean . eli expunged it
because i gave him a couple of my ass xeroxes .
he &apos;s laminating them and using them as place mats .
my idea .
for what , max ? why &apos;d you get me fired ?
why &apos;d i get you fired ?
well , let me give you a &quot; for instance . &quot;
i once knew this girl who was so used to not failing
that the first time she did ,
she got so scared , she forgot who she was
and tried to be somebody else ,
and then she touched my breastesses .
look , it &apos;s cool if you don &apos;t
want to join in on the cupcake dream ,
but at least wait till you find another .
don &apos;t hop on the first one that comes along .
it &apos;s a dream , not a man .
see ? you are a dirty girl .
i &apos;m a dirty , dirty girl .
hey , cupcake quitters .
look , do you see what you &apos;ve driven me to ?
supermarket cakes .
sophie , you don &apos;t need to eat those .
you can have one of ours .
max &apos;s homemade cupcakes is back in business .
it would be cruel to kid me .
nope . we &apos;re doing it differently this time .
we are ? how ?
i have no idea .
but for starters ,
you &apos;re my new junior executive executive &apos;s assistant .
i will knock you to the ground .
well , mama happy now .
