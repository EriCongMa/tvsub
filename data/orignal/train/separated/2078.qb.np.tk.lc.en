two of you , out of here !
hey , coach , your phone &apos;s ringing .
thanks , johnny .
mcgarrett .
c.o.d. appears to be two close @-@ contact gunshot wounds to the back of the head .
we get an i.d. ?
uh , he doesn &apos;t appear to have any identification on him .
we know how long he was in the water ?
well , based on the condition of his skin ,
i say no more than a few hours .
okay , my guess : he was dumped from a boat ,
weighted down with something heavy
until the rope slipped off .
look at these linear abrasions on his wrists .
they suggest that the victim was tied up and unable to defend himself
while he sustained these facial injuries .
so whoever did this tortured him and beat him before they killed him .
max , let &apos;s get the prints to the lab .
see if we can work out who this guy is
and why it went down the way it did .
commander .
yeah ?
okay , thanks .
you good ?
ready ?
let &apos;s go .
what are you looking at ? what ?
what do you mean , &quot; what ? &quot;
you don &apos;t think i saw that little handoff between you and max ?
what is it ?
read it .
i &apos;m gonna read it .
you , uh ... you had max run your dna against wo fat ?
that &apos;s right .
why on earth would you do something like that ?
why ... i would do something like that ,
because i suspected that we might be half brothers .
you and wo fat ?
it &apos;s the only explanation i could come up with , okay ?
wo fat-- he &apos;s a sociopath ,
he &apos;s a terrorist , he had my father killed ,
yet my mother is protecting him .
she &apos;s been protecting him the whole time .
why would she do that ?
i can &apos;t figure it out .
but , uh , just so i &apos;m clear , you @-@ you say he &apos;s a psychopath ,
he &apos;s @-@ he &apos;s a sociopath ,
so you just automatically assume you two are brothers .
makes sense to me .
i got nothing else . i ...
give me something else .
well , this clearly states that he is not your brother .
so maybe your mother &apos;s just trying to protect you .
from what ?
well , uh , the way i see it ,
this thing between you and wo fat , it ends two ... two ways .
one of which , you are dead .
uh , so maybe your mother , by visiting him in prison ,
she &apos;s trying to make peace .
maybe end the blood feud before someone else gets hurt .
no . no .
not my mother . come on , you know doris .
she &apos;s up to something .
she &apos;s up to something .
i just wish to hell i knew what it was .
okay , try it now .
come on .
yeah !
all right .
okay .
is there anything you can &apos;t do ?
cook and clean .
all right , we &apos;re in trouble then ,
&apos;cause that makes two of us .
oh , no .
all right , let &apos;s get out of here .
you got a little , uh ... something .
okay , so where to ?
hangchow .
about a hundred miles .
you think we &apos;ll be safer in the city ?
i don &apos;t know .
but it &apos;s got the closest airport .
so we &apos;re getting out of china ?
we &apos;re not .
you are .
kono ...
you saw what happened back there .
my brother &apos;s army will keep coming after us
until we &apos;re dead .
so we fight them off like we did back ...
no , kono .
there &apos;s no way to win this .
i &apos;m not leaving you .
i didn &apos;t come this far to walk away ...
you &apos;re not listening to me .
you stay with me , we &apos;re both dead .
it &apos;s just a matter of time .
they &apos;ll find us sooner than later .
so we find them first .
what are you saying ?
we hit them before they hit us .
hard .
so they don &apos;t get up .
i never liked playing defense .
you &apos;re crazy , you know that ?
whoa !
wow .
look at this-- reunited .
how &apos;s it feel , baby ? it feel good ?
yeah , i.t. just installed her .
64 @-@ bit core processor .
next gen ultra hd adjustable display .
floatware , voice command .
wow .
that &apos;s great-- you two should get a room .
you guys don &apos;t want to give her a spin ?
no . look , hey , if , uh , it doesn &apos;t heat up a pizza ,
i got no use for it .
chin , did we get the i.d. on the vic from the lab ?
yeah , actually it just came in .
guy &apos;s name is michael maki .
as you can see , he &apos;s got a rap sheet .
mostly drug offenses .
parole puts him as a driver
for pacific isles limousine .
i reached out to the manager there , who told me that maki
confirmed an airport pick @-@ up a few hours ago .
now , the client gave his name as john smith .
and he requested maki to be his driver by name .
why would he do that ?
that &apos;s a very good question
considering the limo company says
that smith is a first @-@ time customer .
now , maki never checked in , so the manager says
that he tried to locate him using the limo &apos;s gps ,
but it was disabled once they left the airport .
okay , well , uh , john smith .
we know our suspect is very creative .
yeah , but he gets the job done .
i mean , two shots
to the back of the head ,
close range , on a parolee
with a history of drug trafficking .
body dump to cover up the crime .
i mean , this looks like a hit to me .
yeah , i &apos;ll pull the surveillance footage
from the airport ,
both inside and out , along with the flight manifests
for arrivals around the time of maki &apos;s pick up .
let &apos;s see if we can &apos;t find this mr. smith .
excuse me , gentlemen .
billy harrington . what are you doing here , man ?
how you doing ?
it &apos;s been a long time .
yeah , man , last time i saw you
you were reassigned to some classified op ?
yeah , it was a hot extraction out of north korea .
right , that ... i &apos;m sorry about that .
no , no problem , don &apos;t worry about it .
look , i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m sorry that i , uh , dropped by like this ,
but i just needed to talk to you and thought it was better
if i did it in person .
yeah , of course .
come on in .
what can i do for you , man ?
well , i don &apos;t know if you heard , but i cut away from the navy .
congratulations .
what are you doing for work ?
uh , actually that &apos;s why i &apos;m here .
i &apos;m starting a private security firm .
all right .
and i wanted you to hear it from me first
that i offered catherine
a job running my intel department .
sounds like a great opportunity
if she was ready to leave the navy .
she didn &apos;t tell you , did she ?
uh , no , she didn &apos;t .
me and my big mouth .
did she take the job ?
actually no , she turned it down .
she say why ?
no , but if i had to read between the lines ,
i think that she &apos;s worried that working with me might affect
her relationship with you .
come on , man , look .
i know you guys had a thing ...
then you know it &apos;s over .
and you know me , we served together ,
i would never do anything to get between the two of you .
come on , steve .
the only reason i &apos;m here is because catherine is
hands down the best person for the job .
i know that , look .
she &apos;d be an incredible asset to any team .
let me talk to her .
all right .
come check this out .
are we good ?
we &apos;re good . thank you .
i &apos;ll walk you out .
so , this is footage
from the arrivals terminal .
check out the cowboy .
now we lose him for a minute here .
then we pick him up outside .
here .
chin , freeze that .
run facial rec .
雷 · 哈珀
our killer &apos;s a cop .
this happened in &apos; 92 .
ray harper was a rookie
cashing his first paycheck as a ranger .
hell of a way to start to a career .
oh , it gets better .
harper ended up becoming one of the most decorated officers
in the history of the ranger division .
okay , tell me this .
why would a hero
travel all the way to hawaii
just to murder a limo driver ?
maybe our victim
is part of a case that harper was working .
i thought that , too ,
but then i spoke to his commander .
harper was injured in a shoot @-@ out a little while ago .
he was riding a desk for six months .
he &apos;s supposed to be on vacation .
nothing says r and r
like whacking somebody out , right ?
yeah , flagged him with homeland security .
neither harper nor his alias has shown up
in any passenger manifests leaving the island .
okay , uh , harper comes here to kill maki .
he &apos;s already done that . what &apos;s he still doing here ?
maybe he &apos;s not finished .
now is that any way to welcome a man into your home ?
who are you ?
what do you want ?
i &apos;m just , uh , looking for a guy and a girl .
i &apos;m told you know where i can find them .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
yeah , you do .
michael maki says you do .
who ?
okay .
you want to play that game ?
what the hell do you want , man ?
i prefer chunky , but this &apos;ll do .
everything all right ?
yeah , everything &apos;s fine .
i heard billy stopped by .
billy did stop by .
about that ... yeah , listen .
the only reason i didn &apos;t say anything to you
about leaving the navy was because i wasn &apos;t sure .
and @-@ and that was a decision that i had to make on my own .
on your own or with billy ?
okay , no , listen .
my c.o. told him that i was thinking
about resigning my commission .
i haven &apos;t even submitted my letter yet .
so you &apos;re actually serious about this .
i &apos;ve spent half my life in the navy , steve .
it &apos;s like i need to start thinking about what &apos;s next .
all right , so why would you , uh ,
why would you turn down the job with billy ?
not right for me .
catherine ,
it &apos;s tailor @-@ made for you-- recon and surveillance ,
risk assessment , protection services ?
please .
why would you say no ?
because i &apos;m really happy right now .
i mean , things are good between us .
and i don &apos;t want a job--
even if it &apos;s the perfect job--
to get in the way of that .
steve ?
hpd just found maki &apos;s limo
parked outside a house in waipahu .
excuse me .
okay , tell hpd to secure the perimeter .
no exits , no entries .
we &apos;re on the way .
all right .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m gonna miss seeing you in those cammies .
i got to go .
yeah .
look at this .
look what arrived .
beautiful , huh ?
looks nice .
what are you doing ?
let &apos;s go .
that sounds good .
you &apos;re not gonna let me drive my new car ?
you &apos;re a real jerk , you know that ?
you &apos;re grinding the thing .
i &apos;m not grinding the thing .
what are you talking about ?
this thing is an animal . let me tell you about ...
zero to 60 in under five .
under five , okay ? mm @-@ hmm .
corners like it &apos;s stuck to the road .
it &apos;s a dream . i love this car .
are you enjoying yourself ?
i am . i am .
good .
are you enjoying yourself as much as you enjoyed
having that conversation with your girlfriend &apos;s ex @-@ boyfriend ?
what are you talking about ? billy &apos;s ...
billy &apos;s opening a private security firm , okay ?
he heard catherine was leaving the navy .
he wants to offer her a job .
came to me out of respect
to make sure it was okay .
aha !
okay , well , uh , i &apos;m gonna just take a stab here .
did he tell you that , uh , offering her the job
has nothing to do with their past relationship ,
all due respect to you ,
and that she @-@ she &apos;s the only person for the position ?
yes , that &apos;s actually exactly what he said .
ha , that &apos;s funny .
did he also say that you should convince her to take the job ?
which , by the way is a terrible idea .
wait @-@ wait , stop , stop .
okay .
billy &apos;s a solid guy .
&quot; guy &quot; being the operative word here .
the guy who is gonna be working
long , hard hours with your beautiful ,
intelligent , sexy , attractive girlfriend .
danny , billy and i served together .
we saw action together .
he &apos;s all about integrity and character .
that is exactly why it is a terrible idea .
that doesn &apos;t make any sense .
you see , that is why you will never see it coming , pal .
you are complacent , okay ?
you need to fortify your position .
at all times , at all times ,
you need to protect your queen like , uh , chess .
no , not like in chess , danny .
in chess , the queen is a fighting piece ,
and you use her to protect the king .
what are you talking about ?
okay , okay .
it was a metaphor .
it was a metaphor for you losing
the best thing that ever happened to you .
there &apos;s nothing to worry about .
catherine , she turned the job down .
good . her decision ?
yeah , i told her to take the job .
very good . her decision .
makes you look like the confident , understanding , boyfriend .
everything is good .
all right .
she &apos;s gonna need a job , danny .
we &apos;ll get her a job !
you know , there &apos;s got to be
a testosterone @-@ free workplace somewhere on this island .
i mean , we &apos;ll get her a job at a convent , nice women &apos;s charity ,
sell donuts , i don &apos;t know . something .
the point is , it is good
that she did not take that job , trust me .
trust me . as a friend , i know these things .
duke .
no one &apos;s been in or out since we got here .
that &apos;s maki &apos;s limo .
we know who owns this place ?
it &apos;s a rental .
name on the lease is tom akuna .
he has priors for drugs and assault with a firearm .
no known association with our suspect harper .
okay , let &apos;s go .
clear .
i &apos;m clear .
clear .
i got fresh blood .
all right , well , if harper killed akuna ,
then where is the body ?
i got at least 75k here .
ah , so he wasn &apos;t obviously after the money .
all right , harper left the limo here ,
which means he &apos;s gotta be driving akuna &apos;s car , right ?
chin , find out what that is ,
get an apb out .
we find that car , we find our killer .
you &apos;re dead ! you hear me ?
you son of a bitch ! you &apos;re a dead man !
you don &apos;t know who you &apos;re dealing with .
you were born here , right ?
what &apos;s it to you ?
i was making small talk .
it took me ten hours and two planes to get here .
not a whole hell of a lot to do
sitting in a tin can at 30,000 feet .
of course , there &apos;s movies ,
but for my money , they haven &apos;t made a good one since godfather .
godfather ?
arguably , part ii was a better movie ,
but that &apos;s just a matter of taste .
what the hell are you doing ? !
you ever read those in @-@ flight magazines , tom ?
you know , the ones they stick behind the seat with the vomit bags ?
most people don &apos;t pay much mind .
they &apos;re too busy listening
to music or watching the aforementioned crap
that passes for entertainment .
me ? call me old @-@ fashioned ,
but i &apos;m a reader .
i &apos;ll read anything you put in front of me .
and those in @-@ flight magazines , they &apos;re good reading .
for instance , there was this one story
about the rat population on this island .
seems that those nasty little rodents just ruined
the sugarcane crop .
then about a hundred years ago some genius decided
to import indian mongoose from jamaica
to exterminate those rats .
now , on the surface , that seemed like a hell of a good plan ,
cause the mongoose is a natural predator of the rat ,
but what our well @-@ intentioned friend didn &apos;t understand was
that this particular species of rat is nocturnal .
which means they &apos;re active at night .
whereas the mongoose is diurnal .
yeah , yeah , i had to look that one up , too .
it means they &apos;re a daytime creature .
so , as you can imagine , those rats to this very day
are running around these fields all night long .
and you know what they like even more than sugarcane ?
i &apos;ll give you one guess .
hey , you can &apos;t do this to me .
you hear me ? !
seems to me it &apos;s already done .
if you don &apos;t mind , i &apos;m gonna hit the road .
when it comes to rats , i &apos;m a little squeamish .
hey , you can &apos;t do this to me ! you hear me ? !
okay , all right .
those two you &apos;re looking for , i know where they are .
where is she ? !
start talking ,
or so help me god , i &apos;ll put a bullet in your face .
hey ! five @-@ o ! drop the gun .
drop the gun right now .
come back later .
it &apos;s over , ray .
put down the gun . come on .
i &apos;m about to question this young man
on a very pressing matter .
i &apos;m not gonna let you stop me from doing that .
i &apos;m about to shoot you in the back of the head
if you don &apos;t put that gun down , ray .
i &apos;m guessing you gentlemen are packing nines ,
which means you have plenty of firepower .
the question is , how fast are you on the trigger ?
me , i got a simple six @-@ shot colt ,
but i &apos;m quick and i &apos;m one hell of a shot .
chances are , we tangle ,
one of you is going down .
i wouldn &apos;t bet on that .
put the gun down .
you &apos;re making a big mistake .
you know , michael maki &apos;s body
washing up on that beach like that ?
that was shoddy work , ray .
it was very disappointing
for a man who is supposed to know
how to cover his tracks .
i mean , you disabled the gps in the limo ,
but you missed
the tracking system on akuna &apos;s car .
what &apos;s the matter with you , ray ?
you might as well have sent us an invite
to the kid &apos;s hotel room .
tell me , were you gonna kill that kid
like you killed maki ?
i didn &apos;t kill maki .
and i suppose you didn &apos;t kill akuna either .
that &apos;s right .
then why don &apos;t you tell me where he is then ?
all right , carl , maybe , uh ,
maybe you could help me out with something .
i got , uh , i got seven unsolved robberies
the last 24 hours , all over town .
our suspect is a white male ,
black ski mask ,
uh , silver gun .
total take , about six grand in small bills .
what , uh , what can you tell me ?
okay , explain something to me .
why is it that a kid
with no record till today
would travel 4,000 miles to oahu
to , uh ... commit a bunch
of silly @-@ ass stickups ?
what , they don &apos;t have convenience stores in san antonio ?
it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s not what you think .
okay , well , then enlighten me , please .
and start by telling me how you know ray harper ,
and why would he put a gun in your face ?
no ?
who &apos;s that ?
hmm ? nobody ?
who is it ?
see , i &apos;m gonna , i &apos;m gonna go out on a limb here
and say that you @-@ you care a lot about this girl , okay ,
cause the smile on your face right here is a lot different
than the look you got on your face right now .
i know something is going on ,
and know that it &apos;s a lot bigger
than these goofy little stickups , okay ?
so tell me what it is ,
and i will help you , i promise .
okay , so my guy &apos;s not saying anything ,
but he &apos;s got a friend .
i &apos;m thinking we can get to her ,
we could maybe get some answers .
who is she ?
who is she , ray ?
it &apos;s the same girl , ray . who is she ?
is this your daughter ?
is she your daughter ?
her name is amanda , and she &apos;s not just my daughter .
she &apos;s my life .
okay , well , do amanda a favor
and trust us on this , okay ?
you need to tell us . where is she ?
is she in trouble ?
i don &apos;t know .
couldn &apos;t find her .
that kid you stopped me from questioning knows where she is .
carl , you have five seconds , okay ?
five seconds to tell me where amanda is
or i &apos;m gonna let her father come in here
and ask you himself , and i promise you ,
he &apos;s not gonna be as polite as me , okay ?
look , i @-@ i @-@ i don &apos;t know where she is . i swear .
this whole thing just got way out of hand .
what whole thing ?
i got involved with some guys
that i went to school with back in san antonio .
they offered me two grand , a limo and a couple plane tickets .
all i had to do was take a bag of cash
out to some of their friends in north shore .
and they told me
to bring a girl because it would be less suspicious .
amanda , she didn &apos;t know anything about any of this .
okay , how much cash ?
$ 75,000 .
did you make the delivery ?
no , no . we got robbed on the way .
some guy in a ski mask jacked us at a stoplight .
okay , well , either they are the luckiest thieves on planet earth
or you were set up .
that kid wasn &apos;t even on my radar .
amanda doesn &apos;t talk to me about boys .
what about amanda &apos;s mother ?
she took off when amanda was three .
i &apos;ve been raising her on my own ever since .
about two weeks ago , amanda started begging me
to let her go on a trip to hawaii
with a girlfriend &apos;s family .
she &apos;s a good kid , she &apos;s never been in trouble .
i had no reason not to trust her .
i told her to call me when she got settled .
she never did .
she wouldn &apos;t go 24 hours without calling me .
it &apos;s just not the way she was raised .
i tried her phone ,
but every time i called , it went straight to voice mail ,
so i did some digging .
found out she didn &apos;t go with her girlfriend ,
she went with this jacobson kid .
and i followed his trail .
okay , so that &apos;s how you found michael maki .
with a little texas charm ,
he told me he picked the kids up .
they were supposed to drop off a bag of money
when they got robbed .
then he drove &apos; em to his middleman akuna &apos;s house
to figure out what to do .
well , so who killed maki ?
i don &apos;t know .
when i left him , he was hurting ,
but very much alive .
well , what about akuna ?
i cut him loose once he pointed me towards jacobson .
this guy akuna
sent me to ... to meet his boss .
he told me if i told his boss everything ,
he sh @-@ should understand .
let me guess : he didn &apos;t understand .
no .
why would you not come to us in the beginning , ray ?
no offense ,
but i don &apos;t know you .
which means i don &apos;t trust you .
when i looked into this ,
i realized amanda could be in some trouble
with some real players .
i wouldn &apos;t put her life in your hands or anyone else &apos;s .
ballistics came back on the bullets
max pulled from maki &apos;s skull .
they &apos;re not a match to ray &apos;s colt .
all right , so ray &apos;s telling the truth .
okay , uh , the kid messed up .
the guys that he was supposed to deliver the money to ,
they have amanda .
if they don &apos;t get the money in 48 hours ,
they are going to kill her .
what are you doing ?
