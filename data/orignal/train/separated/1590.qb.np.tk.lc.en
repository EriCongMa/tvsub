kidnapping is a very serious crime .
they can &apos;t prove that you bought that toy ,
or you gave it to daphne .
you said yourself that ana has no business taking care of baby
when she can &apos;t take care of herself .
flintwood has one of the best athletic programs in the country .
my moms couldn &apos;t afford it .
i &apos;m offering you a scholarship .
i don &apos;t care that you forgot some words to a stupid song .
i care that you took some freaking mystery pills ,
and didn &apos;t think about what would happen next .
idyllwild would like to offer you a full ride
to their summer music program .
she &apos;s a criminal !
she &apos;s my baby !
mommy !
daphne keen ?
yeah ?
we &apos;d like to ask you a few questions .
there &apos;s something i have to tell you . i should live with robert .
i mean , i &apos;m just trying to understand here .
did he ... did he threaten you ?
or say something to make you think
that this is the only choice that you had ?
just ... you just seemed pretty upset
after your last visitation with him .
no , no .
well ... what happened to make you change your mind ?
we all know that the judge is gonna rule in robert &apos;s favor .
it &apos;s just a matter of time .
and i can &apos;t keep asking you to pay all these legal fees .
this is about money ?
sweetheart , we can figure out the money .
i &apos;m just tired of fighting when there &apos;s no point .
ok . why don &apos;t you , uh , go grab some breakfast ?
it &apos;s almost time for school .
hey , love , listen . uh ...
can you not say anything to robert about your decision just yet ?
maybe we can leave this between us for a few days ?
ok , sure .
i tell you , as soon as robert gets wind of this ,
he will have us in court so fast your head &apos;ll spin .
and , you know , she &apos;s right .
that judge is just dying to give him custody .
i just want to know what she &apos;s thinking .
i don &apos;t get it . i don &apos;t get it . i don &apos;t get it at all .
i know . but is it really so hard to believe that ,
after everything she &apos;s been through , that she &apos;s just ...
... she &apos;s just tired of living in limbo ?
that she just wants to make a choice before one is made for her ?
no , i don &apos;t buy it .
i think there &apos;s something else going on here . i guarantee it .
because even if callie was tired of fighting for herself ,
she would never stop fighting for jude .
i know it &apos;s not what we wanted .
we wanted to be adopted by the same family ,
living in the same house .
but , jude , knowing that you &apos;re safe
and adopted by a family that truly loves you ...
that &apos;s all i &apos;ve ever wanted .
hey , i &apos;m gonna be safe , too .
i &apos;m gonna be living with robert ,
but i &apos;m always gonna be a part of the fosters .
it &apos;s just like stef and lena always say ,
we don &apos;t need a piece of paper to be a family .
i &apos;m still gonna go to anchor beach ,
and i &apos;ll be around all the time .
i &apos;ll spend the night sometimes .
and you can spend the night with the quinns whenever you want .
and they have a pool . you love to swim .
maybe if you learned how to drive ,
he &apos;d buy you a car and then you could pick me up for school .
so we could still see each other every morning .
yeah . for sure . i &apos;ll make it , like , a condition .
i know we didn &apos;t get our happy ending just how we wanted it ,
but we &apos;re still getting it , right ?
come on .
listen , we have , um ...
we &apos;ve done a little bit of research on the flintwood academy .
and we can &apos;t deny that it &apos;s a great school .
so i can go ?
well ... we just don &apos;t think that you &apos;re ready to be on your own .
you &apos;re only 15 .
i &apos;m not gonna be on my own . it &apos;s a boarding school .
you &apos;re letting brandon go on tour .
there are gonna be no adults there at all !
that &apos;s true , that &apos;s just for a few weeks , though .
honey , if this were just a camp , or something over the summer ...
well , can you meet with the scout and at least hear him out ?
honey , we would just be wasting his time .
i can &apos;t believe this .
honey , you can wrestle here .
we can still get scouts to come by anchor beach , you know .
not anymore . you &apos;ve gutted the entire athletic department .
anchor beach is a joke .
i &apos;m going to school .
he didn &apos;t mean that , love . he loves anchor beach .
no , no , he &apos;s got a point .
that &apos;s why all this whole financial mess is so frustrating .
we &apos;ve had to cut so much just to keep the doors open .
what about timothy ? is he still ...
convinced that monte is the enemy ? yes .
which leaves me in the delightful position
of trying to support my boss
and trying to protect my friend &apos;s job at the same time .
i &apos;m sorry , love .
but if there &apos;s anyone that can broker a peace deal ,
it would be you .
反璞归真舞团
dance team auditions today after school . flier ?
here . take a flier .
hey . what about me ?
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
tia and i decided that it &apos;s best to get a fresh start .
we don &apos;t want anyone from the old team .
you know , conflict of interest and all that .
um , you guys are from the old team .
yeah , but we left . you got cut .
you &apos;re not gonna find a better dancer in school than me .
i don &apos;t know . i mean , if it was up to me ,
i would totally say yes .
but tia is , like , crazy hard to impress .
ok . what if i just come and dance ?
i bet i could blow her mind .
well , i can &apos;t stop you from showing up ,
but i can &apos;t guarantee anything .
great . see you this afternoon .
oh , my god , april is killer . is she in ?
i don &apos;t know . i told her she had to audition .
you did ? why ?
well , april only responds to mean girls .
the meaner you are to her ,
the more she &apos;ll work for your approval .
what do you mean , my approval ? why me ?
well , april already knows i &apos;m nice ,
so you have to be the mean girl .
but it &apos;s not like you have to do anything , just be yourself .
wow , thanks .
seat taken ?
you &apos;re quiet today .
you barely said anything during breakfast .
how are you ?
i &apos;m cool .
yeah ?
yeah .
how is everything ?
with the band , you said you guys are burnt out ?
oh , no , i just ... need a little break . nothing major .
hey , i never , uh , never asked you how daphne &apos;s visit with tasha .
why ?
just wondering .
it was ok .
did tasha remember her , from christmas ?
nope .
that &apos;s good .
lucky she didn &apos;t get caught .
we &apos;re all lucky , brandon .
you haven &apos;t told anyone , have you ?
no .
good . don &apos;t .
a lot of bad stuff could happen if people find out .
ok .
i should get to class .
hey , dad .
hey , b.
i was just wondering if you &apos;re free for dinner tonight .
i can &apos;t , actually . i &apos;ve got family dinner .
what about after ? we could shoot some pool , maybe watch the game ?
i have band practice after .
all right . well , maybe some other time this week , huh ?
yeah , sure . maybe .
all right , have a good one .
you too , dad .
well , uh , you got what you wanted .
excuse me ?
ana got a job , she &apos;s moving out .
that &apos;s not what i wanted , mike .
i just want you to take care of yourself .
yeah ? well , i just hope she can take care of herself .
she &apos;s pregnant , alone ,
and now she &apos;s gonna be up on her feet all night stocking groceries .
and what about after she has the baby ? huh ?
a newly sober single mom ,
raising a baby alone on minimum wage ?
is it really so wrong that i want to help her out ?
i think i can help myself and someone in need , stef .
uh , i , um ...
i don &apos;t think she &apos;s gonna need your help .
mike , she &apos;s ...
she &apos;s not planning on raising this baby .
whatever you might think about ana and who she ...
she ... she stopped by the other day .
what do you mean , stopped by ? to your house ?
for what ?
she asked us to adopt her baby .
so the people of the village silently accept the murder
of a randomly selected member of their society . why ?
tia .
because it &apos;s a tradition
that they think binds their community .
that &apos;s right .
tradition in the lottery ,
oppression in the hunger games .
so whose silence do you think is more egregious , theirs ...
... or the citizens of panem ?
mariana .
well , it &apos;s easy to say the townspeople , but , like ,
everything you &apos;ve been taught is true from the day you were born ,
like , i don &apos;t know , racism or something like that ,
can be every bit as oppressive as some outside force . right ?
that &apos;s great , mariana . now , it has been said
that &quot; a man is known by the silence he keeps . &quot;
your assignment this week is to write about a silence
that you keep in your life .
have a great day , everyone .
the principal and vice principal .
this must be important .
i thought we agreed , no poaching dancers .
april ?
umm , april isn &apos;t your dancer .
you threw her off the team
because she was drunk at my party , remember ?
though she was stone cold sober compared to you that night .
whatever .
april &apos;s never gonna join your loser team anyway .
yeah , especially when she hears about your super lame
dystopian robot theme .
well , we &apos;ll see about that .
now , excuse me , you &apos;re blocking my locker .
there are plenty of grants available
that aren &apos;t based on test scores .
yes , there are , but not many , and they &apos;re typically much smaller .
fine , but unlike the ones you &apos;re in favor of ,
they &apos;re not funded by private corporations
that are trying to dictate education reform .
you think i &apos;m in support ...
educators are the ones that should ...
standardized testing is a tool ,
one tool , used to measure a school &apos;s success .
by teaching students to memorize , not to think !
wait a minute . wait a minute .
we are not asking you to teach students to memorize .
we are asking you to think about the bigger picture !
anchor beach is facing a real financial crisis ,
one that could actually close the doors .
and this is not just about ...
i &apos;m not doing this just to be difficult !
this is not just about your english classes , timothy .
it &apos;s about art , music , sports .
and i don &apos;t want to have to cut those programs .
but if you &apos;re too dogmatic to see beyond your own classroom ,
you &apos;re welcome to resign .
ok .
how can i be more ... cooperative ?
well , you could start by teaching ... more critical thinking .
more non @-@ fiction .
i &apos;ll get right on it .
we need to talk .
not here .
ok ...
the cops came over to my place the other day .
why didn &apos;t you call me ?
i don &apos;t know , i guess i was afraid
that they were tapping our phones or somethin &apos; .
what did they want ?
they wanted to know where i was on christmas eve .
and ?
so i told &apos; em that i got off work ,
i went home right after work and i was by myself all day .
yeah .
they asked if i could prove it .
the cops don &apos;t have anything .
why do you think they &apos;re trying to get us to talk ?
they said i can go to jail for 11 years for kidnapping .
eleven years just &apos; cause i wanted to hold my baby .
robert &apos;s lawyers aren &apos;t gonna let that happen .
robert &apos;s lawyers aren &apos;t looking out for me ,
they &apos;re looking out for you .
they don &apos;t care about the brown girl .
they &apos;ll throw me under the bus first chance
they get just to save your ass .
i &apos;m not gonna let that happen .
you don &apos;t have control !
no , i don &apos;t , but robert does .
and he &apos;s gonna do what i say .
you sure about that ?
yeah , &apos; cause i &apos;m gonna live with him .
why ?
it &apos;s for the best , ok ?
i can &apos;t even look stef and lena in the face right now .
i swore that i would never lie to them again .
so why don &apos;t you just tell them ?
you wanna go to jail ?
ok ? &apos; cause that &apos;s what would happen .
i would be taking you and brandon down with me .
what about jude ?
i lied .
i told him that i had to be out of the system .
and he &apos;s been in the system , so he understands . he &apos;ll be ok .
i should have never called you that night .
yeah , but you did .
is robert here ?
so , uh , how &apos;d you get all the way over here ?
i took the bus .
a couple , actually .
callie told me she &apos;s coming to live with you .
she &apos;s only doing it
because she &apos;s scared of getting yanked out of the house again .
jude ...
we &apos;ve been moved from house to house for six years ,
and we never had any say in where we &apos;re going to live
or when we &apos;re going to be sent to another house .
it felt like nobody wanted us .
but then stef and lena , they ...
they took us in .
and i &apos;m so glad they did .
they care so much about you and callie .
we finally found a home .
and callie still doesn &apos;t feel safe .
robert and i want the same thing for callie as you do , jude .
but ... maybe ...
maybe , in some ways ,
callie will be safer here .
how ?
we would never take callie away from you .
and if callie does come to live with us ,
i hope you &apos;ll consider yourself a part of this family , too .
hey , i thought you were having dinner with brandon .
apparently , he &apos;s busy .
so you asked stef and lena to adopt the baby ?
i &apos;m sorry , i was gonna tell you , i just ...
i wanted to know what was going on before i said anything .
you didn &apos;t think it was important to talk to me about it first ?
look , i know you &apos;re scared . i get it .
but we can do this , ana .
we ?
mike , there is no &quot; we . &quot;
you are living in some kind of fantasy world !
this is why i need to move out !
you think that if i move in here ,
and you help me raise this baby ,
that we &apos;re gonna live happily
ever after and never do drugs or drink again .
raising a baby makes it harder to stay sober , mike , not easier .
i know that , i &apos;ve been there ! and so have you !
you &apos;d think that you &apos;d know better !
ah ! i gotta get outta here !
ok . we &apos;ll let you know . thank you guys so much .
you all brought ... something .
april , if you can stay ?
turn around .
what ? why ?
we have to make her think that we &apos;re debating .
there &apos;s nothing to debate . april is awesome .
and you saw everybody else .
i told you how this works .
if april thinks that we want her ,
she won &apos;t want us .
she has to feel like she &apos;s the lucky one ,
not the other way around .
don &apos;t forget , be aloof .
so , april ...
you &apos;re in ! congratulations !
but sad face . there &apos;s a little problem .
kaitlyn asked me back on her team .
what ?
no , she didn &apos;t . when ?
today .
i didn &apos;t wanna blow off your audition , but now i &apos;m torn .
i kinda feel obligated to her .
well , if april wants to go back to kaitlyn ,
i mean , that &apos;s totally cool .
yeah , it &apos;s cool .
but i feel kinda bad about you guys .
can i have the night to think about it ?
i guess . but there &apos;s only so many spots we can hold .
don &apos;t you have , like , four ?
yeah , but they &apos;re going fast .
i just want to talk to kaitlyn .
i don &apos;t want her to be all mad .
i &apos;ll let you guys know tomorrow , ok ?
the spots are going fast ?
what was i supposed to say ? this is bad .
kaitlyn is the queen of mean .
and she just asked april back into court .
what are you doing ?
april needs to know what kaitlyn really thinks about her .
so i &apos;m just going to forward her some especially nasty texts .
we &apos;ll see whose team she joins after she reads these .
hey , move , i gotta get to the fridge .
did you hear what i said ? i &apos;m hungry .
move !
whoa ! what &apos;s your problem ?
i &apos;m trying to study .
not that you have any idea what that looks like .
hey , listen . i &apos;m not gonna ask you again . you got it ?
move . or else .
or else what ?
real funny , schizo ! you forget to take your pills or something ?
hey , hey , hey ! what is going on here ? !
get off of him ! are you kidding me ? !
what are you doing ? !
here you go .
thanks .
jude , what happened ? are you ok ?
yeah , he &apos;s fine . he stopped by the house , wanted to talk .
ok . um , well , i &apos;m almost done with my shift .
so why don &apos;t you sit and we &apos;ll go home soon . yeah ?
want a soda or something ?
sorry .
oh , no . no . no need .
he &apos;s a ... he &apos;s a good kid .
um , so listen , is it true ?
have you decided that you wanna live with us ?
yeah .
yeah ?
here you go .
um , what are we doing here ?
before i drop you off at stef and lena &apos;s ,
i wanna show you something .
it &apos;s a surprise .
do you think he bought you a house ?
come on . come on . let &apos;s go inside .
neil ! the paint goes on the floor ?
no , it goes on the wall .
and why are you ... hey !
i thought we were gonna wait
till we were finished before we showed callie .
hey , how are you , jude ?
yeah , well , i thought she could use a smile .
well , what do you think of the new girls united ?
ok , what &apos;s your damage , dude ?
why are you being so freaking aggro these days ?
don &apos;t worry about it .
i &apos;m gonna worry about it ,
because you &apos;re a total jackass .
what the hell is wrong with you ?
you wanna know what &apos;s wrong with me ?
you start a fight with me , and i still get in trouble .
you &apos;re the one who kicked the stool !
&apos;cause you ignored me , like , three times .
ok , so mom is a pain . so what ?
you know , i don &apos;t expect you to understand , golden boy .
what does that mean ?
it means no matter what you do , you get everything .
you get arrested , but you still get to go on tour .
no matter how hard i try , no matter what i wanna do ,
i don &apos;t get to do anything i want to do .
even when it could be really good for me .
like what ?
so i just talked to jesus . we &apos;re cool .
well , good . what was he so mad at you for ?
actually , he &apos;s , uh , mad at you .
so , there it is .
you bought this with the money from the fundraiser ?
well , yeah , that and robert , you know . he did help us .
he came in with a little extra scratch
so that we could definitely get someplace nice like this .
and now , since we own it ,
we don &apos;t ever have to worry about a landlord coming in
and pulling the rug out from underneath us . you know ?
literally .
he really is a good man .
what ?
i &apos;m gonna go live with him .
well , you don &apos;t sound very happy about that .
no , it &apos;s just , um ...
i know i &apos;m hurting lena and stef .
and i hate that .
oh , honey .
you know , sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do .
can you buy callie a car ?
whenever she moves in with you .
i just want her to be able to come home ...
i mean , to my house , the fosters , whenever she wants .
that sounds pretty reasonable .
you &apos;ll have to teach her how to drive , though .
she doesn &apos;t know how .
really ?
she can barely ride a bike .
i &apos;ll see to that .
so ? what do you think ?
it &apos;s amazing .
so , um , i understand
you feel we &apos;re not listening to you .
and , uh , you know , you &apos;re probably right .
sometimes ... sometimes we feel like
we know what you want better than you do .
that used to be the case when you were younger .
but probably not so much anymore .
so i will talk to mama .
we &apos;ll have the scout over , and hear him out .
really ?
yes . but that is all we &apos;re agreeing to ,
so don &apos;t go packing your bags yet or anything .
mom !
i never thought i &apos;d say this to my kid ,
but i will pass on the hug till you &apos;ve showered , please .
mom , can we please get a punching bag in the garage ?
what do you need a punching bag for
when you have your brother , brandon ?
i &apos;m kidding . you mess with him again ,
you &apos;ll have to answer to these guys right here .
wait , i don &apos;t see anything there .
these punching bags .
you &apos;re gonna see stars if you don &apos;t get out of here .
so , uh , i told jesus that we would sit down
with the recruiter from flintwood .
do you hate me ?
what ?
robert just dropped off callie and jude .
thanks for the tea . sorry for barging in .
i don &apos;t know how to say this , uh , exactly , but ...
... are ... are you guys gonna take ana &apos;s baby ?
um ... no .
i don &apos;t think so .
ok .
i know this is gonna sound crazy , but ...
i think i &apos;m gonna ask her if i can .
adopt her baby ?
why not ? i &apos;m capable .
of course ... of course you are , mike , i just ...
a baby ? now ? by yourself ?
otherwise , what ?
let her give it up to some strangers or who knows who ?
no , i hear you , i hear you .
but do you really wanna spend the next 18 years of your life
raising another child ?
i don &apos;t exactly feel like i got a chance
to raise the first one .
it &apos;s not over , mike . he &apos;s still here .
dad .
thought you had band practice .
didn &apos;t you say you were taking a few days off ?
no , yeah . uh ...
got it .
i &apos;m sorry .
you should be .
you know what ?
i &apos;m trying , b.
i &apos;m really trying every way i know how .
you never wanna spend any time together .
is this about ana ?
&apos;cause you don &apos;t have to worry about that anymore .
she &apos;s moving out .
of course she is .
what is that supposed to mean ?
that &apos;s why you &apos;re here , right ?
&apos;cause there &apos;s no one else .
brandon , i know that &apos;s not how your dad feels .
it &apos;s ok .
go on . say what &apos;s on your mind .
whenever you &apos;re not ...
... seeing someone ...
no , actually , whenever you &apos;re not saving someone ,
you dump everything on me .
like all your feelings , your loneliness , everything .
and it makes me feel suffocated .
so i don &apos;t wanna see you , dad .
i &apos;m gonna let you guys ...
you know , brandon , there &apos;s a saying in the program .
&quot; you &apos;ve got a god @-@ shaped hole ,
and you keep trying to fill it with anything but god . &quot;
i &apos;ll work on it , ok ?
but you gotta do better , too , brandon .
you &apos;re at an age now where this relationship is a two @-@ way street .
i can &apos;t force you to see me ,
but if you want me to know what &apos;s going on with you ,
you &apos;re gonna have to tell me .
the ball &apos;s in your court .
whenever you &apos;re ready .
i got a scholarship .
to idyllwild .
for their summer program .
what about the tour ?
so , what do you wanna do ?
i don &apos;t know . i ...
i don &apos;t want to be pressured into anything ,
so i haven &apos;t told moms , but ...
if they knew ...
you think they &apos;d take the tour off the table ?
that &apos;s not true , b.
the whole reason we &apos;re even letting you go on this tour
is &apos; cause we think you &apos;re mature enough to make your own choices .
this is just another choice , b.
i don &apos;t know if i can get invested into classical music again
and not be able to play the way i want .
please , don &apos;t give up on this
&apos;cause you &apos;re afraid of disappointment , brandon .
sometimes it takes a lot of failure to reach success , trust me .
one thing being your dad has taught me , it &apos;s that .
is that the article i just printed out ?
&quot; charter schools and the corporate takeover of public education :
what &apos;s at stake ? &quot; what is this ?
i don &apos;t know . timothy emailed it to us , said to read it tonight .
something about us having to read more non @-@ fiction .
now i have to study about how i &apos;m getting an education ?
who cares about education ?
i mean , no offense .
well , it &apos;s great , it &apos;s really great .
and robert helped you ?
yes . yes .
uh , is something the matter ?
callie told us that she wants to live with robert .
i heard , and i &apos;m sorry .
look , ... we both know that callie
values everyone else &apos;s well @-@ being above her own .
especially girls united .
and , i just think that robert saw that and took advantage of it .
and , he delivered .
&apos;cause this is a really beautiful house .
ok , so , what are you implying ?
that i used callie in order to get this house ?
&apos;cause not only is that absurd ,
it &apos;s actually a little bit offensive .
you knew how much this house would cost callie ,
and you exploited her anyway .
come on , stef . ok ? that &apos;s a bit of a stretch .
first of all , callie didn &apos;t
even know this house existed until today .
robert specifically didn &apos;t want it to seem ...
like exactly what it is ?
stef , i realize that you and lena are very disappointed .
we &apos;re not disappointed , rita . we &apos;re devastated .
she &apos;s our daughter .
and she &apos;s doing this out of obligation , or fear ,
because she does not wanna be taken out of our house again .
or that &apos;s what she &apos;s telling you , so you won &apos;t get hurt .
we &apos;re already hurt .
yes , i can see that .
but wouldn &apos;t you be even more hurt
if she told you she did feel a connection with robert ,
because he is her birth father ?
stef ... listen . i &apos;m ...
thanks , rita .
listen . stef .
so it looks like we can get in to see the judge this afternoon .
we , we love you very much .
and we would never in a million years stop fighting to adopt you .
but if you are tired of fighting and ...
... you want to go live with robert
because he &apos;s your birth father ,
then , we don &apos;t want you to feel like you &apos;re letting us down .
it &apos;s ok .
from the very beginning , all we &apos;ve ever wanted
is for you to have a safe and loving home .
to have a family that loves you unconditionally .
so if this is what you truly want ...
... we will stand beside you , today and everyday .
whether you &apos;re under our roof or not .
any word from april yet ?
no , but i think we &apos;re good .
what &apos;s she gonna do , go back and dance with kaitlyn ,
after all the awful things she said about her ? unlikely .
welcome to the team !
so , ok , so we were thinking
practice everyday after school and saturdays ...
i &apos;m not joining your team .
what ?
you &apos;re going back to kaitlyn ?
no , no way .
not after reading those texts . they were so mean .
well , then why aren &apos;t you ... ?
because sending them to me ? also really mean .
i was just trying to have your back .
yeah , now that you want something from me .
but what about when kaitlyn was saying all those awful things ?
or when she cut me from the team ?
i was the one who said that kaitlyn was being unfair !
i was the one who spoke up for you !
maybe .
but you didn &apos;t do anything .
and actions really do speak louder than words .
sending me those texts ,
that really said a lot , mariana .
looks like i &apos;m not the mean girl after all .
i can &apos;t believe you did this ! i am trying to save your job !
why shouldn &apos;t the students be aware of what &apos;s going on here ?
this is their education , lena , this is their school .
they have the most to lose , or gain .
oh , i see .
and you are going to be the neutral arbiter of this debate ?
what is your goal here , timothy ?
to turn the student body against the administration ?
my goal here , lena , is simply to ...
what &apos;s going on ?
unfortunately , students , i will not be teaching class today .
what ? why ?
i &apos;ve ,
i &apos;ve been fired .
no way !
what ?
are you kidding ?
disappointingly ,
the new administration at anchor beach wants me
to teach you how to take tests , not how to think .
and i won &apos;t do that .
you all have vibrant and brilliant young minds ,
and i encourage you to use them .
speak up for yourselves .
this is your school , your education .
never forget that .
all right . hello , everyone .
it seems i will be teaching class today .
if , uh , someone will just tell me where timothy ...
timothy is , like , our favorite teacher .
how could you just fire him ?
i can &apos;t believe this .
the administration had to make a very difficult decision .
i &apos;m sorry to say it , but timothy wasn &apos;t ...
and we have no say ?
it &apos;s not up for debate .
fine .
but i &apos;m not just gonna sit here and take it .
mariana , sit down .
timothy was right . this is our school .
if we don &apos;t like something about it ,
we have to do something to change it .
i &apos;m walking out .
who &apos;s with me ?
mariana adams foster , get back here !
be right there .
sorry to keep you waiting .
so callie , i hear that you &apos;ve had a change of heart
about who you want to live with .
i took tasha from the park on christmas eve .
but right away i knew it was a mistake .
so i took her back to her foster home that night
and watched her walk up to the door .
when her foster parents opened the door
and i knew she was safe , i ran off .
i see . and was anyone with you ?
did anyone help ?
no .
really ? nobody ?
nope . it was just me .
